DIFFICULTIES OF THE
NEXT BRITISH ADVANCE
LONDON, March 31â4:15 a. m.â The
head of the army of, Lord Roberts is now
about twenty-one miles north of , Bloem
fontein. It occupies a cluster of hills won
from; the Boers 'after a stiff fight, in
which the British' lost seven officers and
100 men., Â¦
The Boers had been using these kopjes
as a base for marauding bands that have
been beating up the country adjacent to
Bloemfontein for supplies, driving off cat
tle and forcing non-resident -Free Staters
into their ranks again. The enemy must
have been in "considerable force, as Lord
Roberts sent 8000 Infantry and 3000 cavalry
against them.
Lord Roberts' progress to Pretoria will
probably consist of such forward r move

Lord Roberts is stripping the forces in

to be tho reason why he recalled Lord

The,. reason why a hot chase was not
made after Commandant Olivier. is that
Lord Roberts did not wish to wear out the

3000 horses in the relief of Kimberley and
the pursuit of General Cronje. Lord Rob

THE LATE ARCHIBALD FORBES:
LIVERPOOL. March SO.â Archibald Forbes, the well-known war correspond
ent, died in this city last night. He had been in had health for pome years,
and during the last six months had been unable to do anything owing to
complications arising from rheumatism and paralysis. His wife was a MiS3
Mrigs. daughter of the late quartermaster general of the United States. Gen
â¢ eral M. C. Meigs.
On his first appearance in the field, some thirty years ago. Archibald Forbes
cook his place in the very front ranks of war correspondents, and up to a short
time ago well maintained hi? portion.
Forbes was born in Moray? hire. Scotland, in IS3S. was a student at the Unlver
Â¦ tity of. AbÂ«-rd~Â»n and later entered the British service in the Royal Dragoons. The
technical knowledge of military affairs therein gained served him in good stead
â¢Â¦â¢when he finally adopted the profession for which he had such a marked natural
Â¦'artrtufle as to frequently call forth the notice of his superiors. In IS7O he went to
'the Franco- Prussian war as correspondent of the London Illustrated News, and
remained in the service of that paper until compelled by ill health to leave the
field '
H/Â» aeeompani<td the German army from the beginning to the end of the war,
giving to the world through his paper the most graphic descriptions of the oper
ations that were ever sent from the flcl a, and he saw and reported the latter part
' ot the Commune, that followed.
In 1574 he reported the terrible famine in India, then the Carlist war in Spain
;. and the. war of 1575 in Serv'.a. His most notable work as a correspondent was in
' Ihe Itusso-Turkish war of 1V77-TS. especially the siege of Plevna.
'â¢' â In the intervals of active work in the field Mr. Forbes wrote a number of books
â¢of military character, the first a novel. "Drawn From Life." then "My Experiences
of the War Between France and Germany"; "Glimpses Through the Cannon
Smoke." 1*SO; "Soldiering and Scribbling," ISS2; "Life of Chinese Gordon." 1884;
"Life of Emperor William of Germany." ISSS, and "Havelock," IS9O, all of which
works are marked throughout with the author's peculiar way of telling things as
he raw them.
BAPTISM OF FIRE FOR
MANY BRITISH TROOPS
BLOEMFONTEIN, March 30.â The at
tack upon the Boers holding the kopjes
near the Karee siding station, a few miles
south of Brandford, was made by Tuck
er's Seventh Division, with the co-opera
tion of French's cavalry. The attacking
troops Included a large force of Austra
lians. Colonel Knight, with 400 New
South Wales mounted infantry, including
Le Gallais' Brigade, attacked the right
flank. A Ion? chain of kopjes was held by
the Boers, and there was severe fighting
all along the line, of attack. The approach
was very sieep, like a fortress, and the
troops were unable to make headway un
til the infantry made an attack upon the
front. The cavalry went round the right
flank of the Boers and used their Vlckers-
Maxim freely.
An army hospital was established in a
cottage under the shelter of a large
kopje. The Boer shells came right, over
the kopjes and landed near the hospital,
which it was found necessary to evacuate.
The Boers slowly retreated upon Brand
ford, taking their dead and wounded with
them. Meanwhile the cavalry, including
the Australian horse and the Sydney Lan
cers under Captain Cox. brigaded with
Porter's brigade, the Carbineers, Scots
Greys and the Innisklllings. received a se
vere shell lire. The Boers had evidently
marked the range, as when the troops
advanced the enemy's fire was less ac
curate.
The colonials displayed great coolness
under fire. Many horses were killed un
der the cavalry's flank attack.
The Boers fled and all our troops rushed
forward, and now hold an excellent posi
tion upon the . kopjes recently held by
the Boers.
The farmers are in the laager fighting,
leaving the women and the children upon
the farms, which they are confident the
English will not touch. Many of these
farmers would surrender their arms but
for the fear that the Johannesburg police
would attack their farms in revenge- for
their doing so. . .
The Boers are known to hold Brandford
in some strength â probably 5000.
Reinforcements are afraid to move di
rect to their support, and are content
with holding their position, which is
threatened by the cavalry, advance.
The whole action was rather insignifi
cant. Many regiments received their bap
tism of fire and showed splendid coolness.
We have now secured a fine natural posi
tion facing the huge plain before Brand
ford.

CRITICIZES BISHOP:
POTTER'S STATEMENTS
Father SlcQuaid Replies to Charge*
Affecting the Philippine
Friars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
.BOSTON. March 30.â Statements cred-
ited to Bishop Potter of New York were
severely criticized last evening at Har
vard In the course of a lecture delivered
in Peabody Hall. Phillip Brooks" house,
by Father J. P. McQuaid. the San Fran
cisco volunteer : chaplain in tho United
States army. Father McQuaid spent a
year and a half In the Philippines. He
said that Bishop Potter, after a visit last
ing four days in the islands, talked and
was listened to as if he were a prophet.
He could not understand how the Bishop
could be taken seriously.
The issue which the chaplain takes
with Bishop Potter relates to the stand
ard of morality among the- Filipinos. Ho
said that the Bishop accused the friars
of having charged exorbitant fees for' the
celebration of the marriage ceremony In
the Philippines, declaring this was the
cause of immorality, as the natives would
not pay the fees. Father McQuaid said
he would like to know If the Bishop could
point out any specific case to prove his
charge.
Tho Bishop, he continued, spoke as If
that condition were general. Father Mc-
Quaid specified on his side of the case
where people of a section of one island
had been without a pastor for four
months, the clergyman having been Im
prisoned. Many children had been born
and the chaplain had baptized about a
dozen. He told the people that he would
perform the marriage ceremony free of
charge and but one couple took advantage
of the opportunity.
With regard to the claim that the friars
stirred up trouble among the natives the
lecturer said he had seen a letter written
by Agulnaldo stating there was no com
plaint against the friars. The great se
cret was .that the friars had lost their
great Influence over the people, and they
lost it through their Spanish pride.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March
30.â Information has been received here from an authoritative source that
the claimants in the Delagoa Bay railroad case are in favor of tho re

Swiss arbitrators. Should the Interpretation placed by the officials of the
State Department upon a somewhat puzzling cable dispatch received by them
from Berne. Switzerland, this morning be borne out by subsequent advices Mrs.
Penfleld. widow cf Colonel McMurdo, the American claimant, will receive only
a few thousand dollars Instead of the 54.C00.000 which she stated was the value
of her late husband's Interest in the road.
The British claimants had expected an award In their favor of nearly J5.000,-
OV>. Counting interest upon the $3,000,000 award made by the Berne tribunal tha
authorities say that the total award will be only $4,125,000. Two-fifths of . this,
they think, are certainly due to Mrs. Penfleld. and they are puzzled by the dis
patch received to-day indicating .that what she would receive will not amount to
more than $13,000.
The dispatch intimated that the first mortgage bonds would have to be liqui
dated first, and that the amount of the award would about cover It, leavlns
about $13,000 for the American claimant.
Administration officials are much chagrined at thÂ« award of tha tribunal.
Their advice further indicates that the Swiss tribunal had declined to change
the valuation of the land 3 for which damages were claimed and which It wai
stated were worth several millions of dollars. If this information be confirmed
the valuation of $40,000 will stand.

son, de-aling with the military situation
in his article in the Morning Post to-day
says:
"The engagement which Lord Roberts
reports could not have been very serious.
The importance of the action lies In the
fact that the Boers will probably for
some time be shy of approaching British
outposts. It would be rash to say that
Lord Roberts is not about to advance im
mediately. The date of the advance will
be secret, so as to prevent the enemy
learning of it. Presumably Lord Kitch
ener Is now at Bloemfont-ln, and this
may be taken as an indication of the im
minence of the advance."

LONDON", March 21.â Kruger has ap
parently made up his mind not to
wait until the British are ready to
advance before resuming hostilities.
He sent a force 'of Boer 3 to Karee
Siding, . fourteen . miles south of
Brandfort,' and only twenty 'miles from
Bloemfontein. They intrenched themselves
there on three kopjes, but Lord Roberts
dispatched an overwhelming force against
them, which drove them back to Brand

100 wounded." .Indications are not' wanting
that President Kruger intends to make

In Natal, as well as in the Free State,

quent before 'a serious action, are begin
ning. Reports from the Boers' headquar
ters state that British troops are massing
at Elandslaagto'and that Colonel Bethune
with his mounted. infantry has been busy
in the neighborhood of Helpmakaar. Fur
ther to the east the Boers are showing
signs of' acting on the offensive once
again. In order to check this disposition
General Buller has had to strengthen his
outposts.
Skirmishing continues at Warrenton.
The situation there suggests that a game
of bluff is being played by the British,
with tho idea of keeping the Boer force
'stationary on the right bank of the river.
Whether they have succeeded .' in doing
this is doubtful. Bodies -of Boers 'are re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. March 30.â The
suspicion that the strange doctor who
dropped in at Knoxville, lowa, and gave
the name of C. J. Carroll was the long
missing physician from Riverside has
been confirmed. There is no longer a
shadow of doubt that it is the Riverside
doctor who so mysteriously disappeared
on January 17, 1887. A son of the missing
man came and interviewed Jolliffe of
Knoxville, who came to take possession
of the property, and returned home satis
tied beyond doubt that his father Is in the
hands of the authorities at Knoxville
awaiting Identification, Sheriff Rouse of
San Bernardino County having wired to
hold him and send a photograph.
Young Carroll is now 29 years of age,
but remembers his father's peculiarities,
and as he compared notes with Jolliffe
he could find no chance of disputing that
the man In Knoxville Is his father. Hl3
father's peculiar habits were proved to
be identical with the Knoxville Carroll.
The latter claimed to be very fond of mu
sic and that he had a piano and two clar
inets at home, which was true.
His property which he located in San
Bernardino consisted of a five-acre orange
orchard located 'Â¦ across a cement ditch,
and his Riverside home was just over the
canal, on Eighth street, In a live-acre
orchard.
The Knoxville Carroll claimed to be a
Grand Army veteran and that he had
served In the war as surgeon and had
been connected with two railroads in an
official capacity since. All of this Is true
of tho missing Riverside man. Then came
the comparison of handwriting, young
Carroll having brought several letters of
his father. Those when compared with
the documents brought by Jolliffe showed
this link completed the chain, for the
handwriting was identical. What he
would do about bringing his father back
the son would not say until he had con
sulted his mother, who is at Riverside In
feeble health.
The court ! records show that Dr. C. J.
Carroll was married at Dlllsboro, Ind.,
In 1862, disappeared from Riverside Jan
uary' 17. 1887, after ten years' residence
there; that his wife heard from him Jan
uary 18 and 19, 1887, and from, that time
not till March 30 at New ,York, but in her
sworn statement she does not mention his
aberration of mind from a blow on the
head, although young Carroll talks of It
and that his father then stated he was
going to Germany. On these points her
divorce proceedings are silent. Divorce
proceedings were commenced May 8, 1888,
default of defendant entered September
24, order settling trial made September 26,
the trial held September 27 and Judgment
rendered the same day granting divorce
and giving the property to plaintiff, twen
ty months after the disappearance of the
defendant. Why the trial was rushed
through so hurriedly and no mention
made of the absent defendant's aberra
tion of mind or departure for Germany is
something of a mystery. Whether Car
roll has been an inmate of an insane asy
lum while absent or has been wandering
about practicing his profession Is not
known, and his family do not seem anx
ious to bring him home to find but. They
evidently, from some words the young
man dropped, look upon the presence of
Dr. Carroll in the flesh at this time as
rather annoying, and not agreeable to the
family. Jolliffe and his family returned
to Knoxville, lowa, to-day.
not. The exchange, the witness said,
rendered a statement at the end of each
month, showing the amount due from the'j
car lines, and he thought that It had run
as high as 515,000 per month. He prom
ised to supply the commissioners -with
the exapt figures. The witness could only
remember one person who had paid him
rebate outside the car lines. This, he
said was a man named Vosburg, repre
senting the Clover Leaf line In the East,
with his office in Toledo. The man was
known as a "live stock agent" of ' the
road. The money under the agreement
was to be paid in cash by Vosburg to the
witness personally, and one or more such
payments were made, but Vosburg want- !
ed to keep his obligations in full.
Acting Chairman Clements asked If the
witness could not show the full records
of the rebates from his books, and he said
he could not, as no book records were
kept. "Why not?" asked the commission
er.
"Well, such accounts are not Interest
ing souvenirs," replied the witness.
Attorneys for the roads tried to get an
admission from the witness that he has
an interest in the Santa Fe refrigerator
line, and he said that he had a contingent
interest In 100 cars until last month, when
they were sold to his partner, v.
President C. E. Maud, of the United
Forwarding Company testified that as
a representative of the Arlington Heights
Fruit Company he had received rebates
each year since he had been in the busi
ness of shipping fruits, the rebates rang
ing from $5 to $35 per car. One year he
shipped all his fruit in C. F. X. cars, re
ceiving a flat rebate of $15 per car on all
shipments, the money being paid to him
personally by E. T. Earl. Last year he
had shipped all his fruit in Santa Fe re
frigerators, the arrangements being made
with him by Ed Chambers, general freight
agent of the Santa Fe Pacinc railroad,
who acted as agent for the refrigerator
line, with headquarters in Chicago.
Mr. Maud also introduced a letter from
E. P. Ripley, president of the Santa Fe
road, admitting that private car lines are
"being used illegitimately to foster the
business of one or more private firms."
Both witnesses admitted that one rea
son why they objected to the present
condition is that the rebates have been
done away with, none having been paid
this year, so far as they know, and the
freight rates to them huvlng thereby been
Increased to the amount of the rebates
formerly received.

Special Dljpatch to The Call.
NAPA, March 30.â The $25,000 breach of
promise suit of Emma Hagemeister
against Edward Ryan has been on trial
in the Superior Court here for two days
past before Judge Ham and a Jury. It
has attracted widespread attention be
cause Ryan is one of Napa's oldest and
best-known citizens and is a retired capi
talist. He is abouf 70 years old. The pro
ceedings in court have developed many
sensational statements from witnesses,
who have given astonishing testimony as
to plaintiff's conduct while a resident of
Napa.
, When one of the witnesses was testify
ing against Mrs. Hagemeister thiÃ morn
ing she wept bitterly.
As a result of the trial one of the wit
nesses called by the defense, Fred Kibler
of Yountville, was arrested to-day for
perjury on a warrant sworn to before
Justice Marois by Mrs. Hagemeister. The
fair plaintiff was the first witness to take
the stand in the case when it began
Thursday morning. She testified that
Ryan had proposed marriage to her and
that the date had been set for Christmas
day, 1599; that after New Year's defend
ant refused to keep his promise, which
treatment of her by Ryan had resulted
in great loss to her, both financially and
otherwise. There was only one more wit
ness for the plaintiff called and her side
of the case was closed.
The defendant then took. the stand and
denied positively that he ever proposed
marriage to the plaintiff, but admitted
that he often visited Mrs. Hagemeister at
her store and also rented a room from
her on Brown street when she was rent
ing a house on that street. Several wit
nesses followed Ryan. The most import
ant was Fred Klbler. He testified that
in November, ISD9, the plaintiff wa^i rec
ommended to him as an eligible woman
to marry. He came to Napa and saw
Mrs. Hagemeister. and the latter prom
ised to wed him, but later on she backed
out.- The courtroom has been crowded
each day with spectators, who have been
eager to hear the testimony that has
been given by the many prominent citi
zens of Napa who have been dragged Into
the case to give evidence. All the testi
mony .was put in by 5 o'clock this after
noon and an adjournment was taken until
9 o'clock to-morrow morning, at which
time the case will be argued by the at
torneys.
It Is one of the most sensational cases
of its nature that has been tried In the
Superior Court here for many years past
and the verdict of the Jury is awaited
with much interest. ,The case has been
stubbornly contested upon both sides.
Thomas B. Hutchlnson and Charles
Beerstecher are attorneys for Ryan and
George Caldwell represents the plaintiff.

The scene In the Chamber to-day was
dramatic. After threats by. the Socialists
it was thought that Slgnor Colombo would
not preside, but at the appointed hour he
entered the house and calmly took his
chair. A howl of rage went. up from the
extreme Left. Signor Colombo sat impas

looking fixedly at the Leftists, some of
whom began to throw paper pellets at
him. Several of these fell short and struck
the occupants of the Ministerial benches.
The ushers induced the paper throwers to
stop, but it was impossible to calm the
uproar.
The -Rightists then arose and cried,
"Vive Colombo!" . ...

would result to the Government In witness

MISS VIOLA HORLOCKER.
She tried to kill with poisoned
candy her employer's wife. Six
women ate of the sweets and nar
rowly escaped death. The girl,
who had been a choir singer and
popular in the society of Hastings,
Nebr., where the crime was com
mitted, returned to that place to
stand trial. She had been in an
Illinois sanitarium, to which place
she will now return.
HASTINGS. Neb.. March 80.â It
took the lawyers several days to
try the Horlocker poisoning case,
but the jury only required an hour
and ten minutes to get back into
the courtroom with a verdict after it was
submitted to them at 10:30 o'clock this
morniner.
County Attorney McCreary concluded
his argument and Judge Adams instruct
ed the jury at considerable length. When
the defendant was summoned to the
courtroom to hear the verdict she was ac
companied by her two sisters.
All were evidently decidedly anxious,
but the accused was the least affected of
the three. She was fairly well composed,
while her sisters sat wringing their hands
as the jury filed in. There was a large
crowd in the courtroom when the Judge
asked the foreman of the jury if th^y
had agreed upon a verdict, and as the
paper was handed up there was a silence
so deep that it was oppressive. -As the
Judge proceeded with the reading of the
verdict and pronounced the words "Not
guilty." Viola Horlocker arose, uttered a
piercing shriek and fell back In t? faint.
Her sisters, who had been greatly agi
tated before, with the assistance of others
in the courtroom, revived her. and as
soon as she was able Miss Horlocker
made her way to the jury box and
thanked each one of the jurymen.
The whole scene was a most dramatic
one. and there were many down whose
cheeks tears trickled. After the usual
preliminaries the defendant was dis
charged from custody and went to the
home of her sister. Now that the strain
of the trial is relaxed it is announced that
she is completely prostrated.
She will probably return to the Jack
sonville, 111., sanitarium. Neither Mr.
nor Mrs. Morey was present in the
courtroom when the verdict was re
turned.

LOS ANGELES. March 30.â T0-day's
sesion of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission was accompanied with sensa
tional'features, the presidents of the
Southern California Fruit Growers' Ex
press and of the United Forwarding Com
pany testifying that they had personally
received rebates from car lines which
handled their fruits.
A. P. Naftzcer, president of the ex
change, said that when he was president
of the Overland Fruit Dispatch, a car line
similar to those now having exclusive
privileges on the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe roads, that corporation was al
lowed three-fourths of "a cent mileage on
the initial lines and one cent mileage each
way on connecting lines in the East, this
with refrigeration charges resulting In
large profits, half of which was turned
over to the exchange, that organization
having half the stock in the Dispatch. He
also stated that the Dispatch received re
ports from its cars, which enabled him
to know Just where every car was at all
times, and he believed that similar Infor
mation is now given E. T. Earl, as mana
ger of the Continental Fruit Express, and
that that Information can be used by him
as the Earl Fruit Company to the disad
vantage of any shipper using his cars,
Karl being. able to throw fruit In ahead
of that of competitors and break or ab
sorb the markets. He said the exchange
has never before paid the full Â¦" refrigera
tion charges of the car lines, always hav
ing a rebate.
He said that the rebates were not
known to all the shippers, and they each
shared according to the pressure they
could exert. The payment of rebates had
continued from the first he knew of the
business until the close of the past sea
son. At one time he said the rebates
granted the exchange amounted to $25 per
car. The rebates were paid for the Santa
Fe refrigerator line by E. H. Davi3 of
Chicago, and were sent in the form of
Eastern exchange. For the Fruit Grow
ers' Express the exchange was sent by
Armour & Co. of Chicago. The checks
were on banks which the witness could
not name. He said he had been offered a
rebate by the Continental Fruit Express,
but had refused, as he did not want to
use Earl's cars. These rebates were paid
whether the fruit was refrigerated or

The woman and two little girls, aged 13

11 years occupied a bedroom. During the
night Webster got up and went through

Asplaiid, who ordered him out of the

Pettus Delivers a Humorous
Speech on Porto Rican
Question.
Aged Statesman Causes His Col
leagues to Forget Tradition and
Shout With Laughter at
His Wit.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â Merriment
swept away the traditional dignity of the
Senate to-day. Staid sticklers for Sena
torial decorum literally held their sides
and shouted "with laughter, while tho
crowded galleries Joined ln the laughing
tumult which not the slightest effort was
made to restrain. Had the effort been
made it would have been futile.
Senator Pettus of Alabama, the oldest
member of the bodyâ his age being only
a few months short of. four score years
delivered the funniest speech heard within
the Senate chamber in many years. It
sparkled with wit and bubbled over with
humor. Its oarcasm was keen but not
bitter, and even those who were the
victims of it could not but enjoy its
perfect good humor and. its unalloyed fun.
Throughout it all Pettus was as solemn
as if he were delivering a funeral oration.
Not a smile softened the deep lines of his
strong and rugged countenance, and as
he stopped occasionally Â« mop the pers
piration from his face and head with a big
silk bandana he glanced about the Senate
as if in surprise at the laughter of- his
colleagues. Indeed, he apologized once
for the lightness of the vein ln which he
was addressing the Senate on so import
ant a question as the Porto Rlcan bill.
Proctor (R.) ; of Vermont had delivered
a forceful argument In support of free
trade" with the island of. Porto Rico. He
was followed by Fettus, who devoted the
first part of his remarks to the constitu
tional phases of the subject. Then, quite
unexpectedly, came the fun as he sharp
ened his wit at the expense of Gallinger
of New. Hampshire and Beverldgo of
Indiana. -â¢?,,,' Â¦ â
"It was a gem., said one Senator, com
menting upon, Pettus' speech, "and will
long stand as one of the best examples of
Senatorial ; fun-making."
' Proctor Favors; Free Trade.
Proctor of Vermont "spoke as an unalter
able ' advocate of the policy of free trade
between the island and the United States.
He quoted 1 extracts from the President's
annual message and the Secretary of
War's report favoring free trade between
the island : of : Porto Rico and the United
States referred to the sudden change that
somehow had been wrought and said:
' Ik it stranire that some of us. in lack of an

CIVIL WAR CLAIMS.
Confederate Raids Recalled by Meas-
ures Before the House.
WASHINGTON. March 20.â The House
devoted the day to war claims. The bill
to remunerate the British Cable Company
for expenses incurrpd ln repairing the Ma
nila cable cut by Admiral Dcwey, which
was under consideration several weeks
ago, was consigned to oblivion, as was
the bill to refer to the Court of Claims
the claims of citizens of certain border
counties of Pennsylvania who suffered
losses during the various Incursions of
rebel forces into that State during the
civil war. This bill haÂ« been before Con
errsn for many years arid involves about
Three bills were passed: To refer the
claims of George \V. Lawrence (involv

Hiram Johnson and others for cotton
burned in East T^nnesseo by the Confed
erate forces, to the Court of Claims, and
to pay MathJas Ped^rson of Spring Val
ley \\'is.. $Â»Â«00. By a curious coincidence
Cox of Tennessee, who commanded the
Confederate forces which destroyed the
cotton in East Tennessee for which the
Government Is now to pay, occupied a
seat on the floor when the bill was passed.
Mahon of Pennsylvania, chairman of
tho Committee on War Claims, then
called up the bill to confer upon tne Court
of Claims jurisdiction to inquire into the
claims of the citizens of the border coun
ties in Pennsylvania for property taken
or destroyed during the civil war by Oen-

while she is not importing old Italian pal

All Boston is curious to know what Mrs.

and this morning from 10 to 1, and on
Saturday afternoon from 2 to 6.
It cost 's 2 to Ret in to see Mrs. "Jack"
and the pictures on the mornings of the
show, and $1 more in the afternoon. Ther&
is a limited number of tickets, but Mrs.
"Jack" is not in the selling business, and
people have to apply by letter to a New
bury-street lady, who is interested in the
home. No anonymous buyers axe consid
ered, and names and addresses of the
users have to be given when the money
is sent.
Not so rigid were the restrictions re

assisted by Otto Roth, violinist, and

sword and got on Moses' side and went to
killing: the Israelites along with Moses.
All these orators will do the same thin?
(laughter)â the last one of them. We saw
an instance of it yesterday afternoon.
At the conclusion of Pettus' speech con
sideration of tho amendment was resumed.
The pending amendment was that of Mor
gan, providing that the United States ln
exchanging the Porto Rlcan coins for
United States coins should pay 100 cents
Instead of 60 cents for each or the Porto
Rlcan pesos. After some discussion the
amendment was defeatedâ l 2 to 33. The
committee amendment as to the exchange
of money was then adopted.
Amendments Considered.
Pettus offered as a substitute for sec
tion 12 a provision declaring that "the
constitution and laws of the United
States shall have the same force and ef
fect in Porto Rico as in other territories
of the United States." It was defeated.
Lindsay of Kentucky offered an amend
ment striking out the provision in section
15 that the Governor should participate
in legislation. Foraker accepted the
amendment.
Allen offered an amendment, the pur
pose of which was to designate Porto
Rico as a Territory of the United States*
In the course of a spirited collocruy be
tween Allen and Foraker, the former said
he did not expect to get an answer to his
question as to why the Porto Ricans were
not given a territorial form of govern
ment. â
"The reason is." interjected Foraker.
"that we did not want to give it to them,
and that is reason enough."
Allen returned to his point and declared
his belief that there was some hidden
purpose in providing "this anomalous
Congressional government."
"I resent the charge." said Foraker,
with evident feeHng. "I deny that there
is any such thing. The Senator when he
speaks so is without any warrant what
ever. I do not know why the Senator
uses such language, which is offensive
and which. I fear, is intended to be so."
Allen disclaimed any reflection upon
Foraker and the incident closed.

PRINCETON. X. J.. March 30.â Ex-
President Grover Cleveland to-day relaxed
his customary reserve 33 to the discussion
of public affairs, and in an interview ex
pressed approval of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty for the neutralization of the Nlca
raguan canal. Mr. Cleveland added that
he hoped the treaty**-ould be ratified. Mr.
Cleveland said:
"With reference to tho canal across
Nicaragua I have always thought that
whatever was done .in its promotion by
the Government of the United States
should be done as a contribution by It to
the cause of progress and advancing civil
ization. It has seemed to me that we had
gained that position among the nations of
the world that would make it appropriate
for us, ln accordance with the spirit oC
our institutions, to make such a contribu
tion. This, of course, means the absolute
neutralization of the Nicaragua construc
tion, and since the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
is directly in line with this sentiment I
am, of course, strongly in favor ot ita
ratification."

Pettus Grows Humorous.
T>^t,,i h % C ?P C K Uslon 2f2 f Pr Â°ctor's speech
Pettus of Alabama nddressed the Senate
on some of the constitutional phases pre
sented by the Porto Rlcan bill. Said he:
How a majority of this Senate has quit the
public roadâ the road pointed out by the law
h in 'b nd ' and also Bhow whal the result ot
In discussing this question we will get back
to the very foundations. The great error of
those. In the majority here is that they are In
violation of all our notlonsof Justice and com-
ESP.r S fH S Â»vJ\ c - y '; ta H. thelr departure In the
belief that the United States Is a sovereign In
the sense that some European nations are sov
ereigns. It is not so, and can never be.
From this time forward Pettus' speech
was Personal In its application. He first
took Gallinger to task, saying:
I was very much entertained by the Senator
from New Hampshire on yesterday when he
informed us that he was not a lawyer and he
proved It to us, not only by asserting It but by
his argument. Lawyers know that whon you
come to read a decision of a Judge you must
take all he says on a subject: that It will not
do to take a sentence here and another there
but that Is exactly what the Senator did In
quoting Justice Bradley in the Mormon church
case.
Pettus then turned his attention to the
speech of Senator, Beveridge, and said:,.
We had a wonderful declamation yestardav
from our great orator â wonderful. it was
marvelous In all Its parts.- It was so marvel
ous that I dare say that such a thing has
never. before been heard In the Senate. When
you get a genuine ' orator he Is absolutely
absolved from all rules -of logic or common
sense. .(Laughter.) When It Is neefssary In
the fervor -of oratorical flourishes to prove
any proposition true or false rules, 6f common
sense and the. decent observance . of what la
due Â¦to others must Â¦ not stand In the way 'of
maintaining "my reputation" as an : orator
It will not do. If It Is necessary I must
break down the Ideas of an observance of what
the ; Senator from Vermont has Â¦ characterized
as the "best policy." ' If It . Is necessary I
must draw on my imagination : for facts and
on my memory for flights of fancy as Ovid
Bolus did. When an orator speaks he has a
right iln the fervor of hla, oratory here in
the United States Senate, s in, reference to the
Republicans and Democrats and Populists and
any other men who may choose to take a seat
here, Â¦ to speak of them as enemies of the
Government.- lie 'has.- a right, to - speak of
them as opponents of the Government. The
Government in his mind Is "me and my wife,
my son John and his wife, ,us four and no
more." (Laughter.) SSPgajÃwffiagteÃÃÃ

Mr. President. I was amazed at that speech.

direction. I tell you - the senior or, the Junior

and â¢ the senior or junior Senator from Maine

Nomination Confirmed.
WASHINGTON. March 30.â The Senate
to-day confirmed the nomination of J J
Girimondi of California to be Consul' at
Santos, Brazil.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â Governor
Steunenberg resumed his testimony at the
Coeur d'Alene investigation to-day, Sulzer
conducting the cross-examination: The
Governor told of his various talks with 1
General Merriam. He first met him In
May last and went over the Insurrection
ary conditions and the necessity for
troops. The Governor said he requested
General Merriam to order the troops to
Shoshone County, and the general did so.
When asked who was in supreme com
mand In Shoshone County, General Mer
riam or BartUtt Sinclair, the Governor,
said that he himself was the responsible
head of authority, although he did not ex
ercise any control or command of the
troops. There was no agreement with
General Merriam, said the Governor, that
the labor organizations were to be broken
up, nor was there any talk of suppressing
them. :Â¦â¢.>Â¦
The Governor again went over his trips
to Washington, his call on the President
and the brief talk with Mr. McKinley.
Questioned as to what the President said,
Governor \ Steunenberg replied that the
President listened to the brief >recltal of
conditions and the need of the continued
presence of the troops, but made no reply.
The Governor was examined as to calls
on Secretary Root, and said the latter in
tended to withdraw the troops from guard
duty on October 20. The Governor called
to protest against this. He found that the
Secretary was quite determined to I with
draw the troops, an order to this effect
having been issued, and most of the Gov
ernor's efforts were directed to showing
to the military authorities that the troops
should not be withdrawn. : ' :
The withdrawal was finally postponed.
The Governor denied that there was any
talk of politics in connection with the
postponement. He told the Secretary
there was no militia available, and not
sufficient time to raise a local guard be
fore the troops would have been with
drawn, and' these representations brought
about the postponement. At present the
troops were not on guard, but were in gar
rison. i.V
McKinley Bid His Sworn Duty.
Further questioned as to calls upon the
President, the Governor said that the
President told one of the delegations that
he had acted as an official in sending
troops on the Governor's call, and that
any other course would not have been a
compliance with his sworn duty.
When Sulzer referred to the "reign of
terror you inaugurated" Governor Steu
nenberg answered emphatically:
"I did not Inaugurate a reign of terror.
It was there before I got there, and has
existed for the last seven years. I know
that country has been a hell on earth for
the last ten years."
Representative Dick opened the redi
rect examination when the cross-question
ing had closed. He said he was sorry
politics had been brought into the inquiry,
but as this had occurred he would pursue
that course to some extent. He asked
Governor Steunenberg as to the reports
of his communicating with Senator Hanna
or with him (Dick), to which the Gover
nor replied that he had never seen either
of them until he came to Washington.
The Governor said he was elected as a
Democrat In 1536 and 1898.
"Did you support Mr. Bryan?" asked
Dick.
"I did." -.*Â¦Â¦<Â¦
"Would you support him again?" . ---/r
"Most assuredly. If he is nominated
again I will support him by all means."
Dick inquired if Bryan had ever written
or expressed any protest or disapproval
of the Governor s course. Sulzer and
Lentz protested and Hay of Virginia ob
jected on the ground that Bryan was not
President. Â»
"But ho will be soon." remarked Lentz,
who added that Bryan would not declare
martial law.
The committee voted to allow the ques
tion as to whether or not Bryan had pro
tested and Governor Steunenberg said he
had never heard from Bryan In protest or
otherwise. . Â¦ Â¦
"Has any prospective Vice Presidential
candidate on the Democratic ticket pro
tested to you?" asked Dick, amid much
laughter directed toward Sulzer.
The Governor said there had been no
such protest. The inquiry was then di
rected to showing the circumstances under
which the Governor had called for troops.
Denies Stories of Cruelty.
Representative Dick continued the ex
amination of Governor Steunenberg dur
ing the afternoon session, going , over a
number of the alleged acts or cruelty oc
curring in the bull pen. As to statements
of the killing of a prisoner (Johnson), the
Governor said that on investigation he
learned that It was a case of suicide of an
insane man. As to the charge that a dying
prisoner had been refused the services of
a priest, the Governor said that an inves
tigation showed the story to be absolutely
false. The Governor specifically denied
the charge that men were subjected to
"vile and Inhuman imprisonment." Every
thing was done for the prisoners that was
possible under the circumstances, he said.
Warden Coakley was In charge of the
prison, and no complaints were made
against him. Many persons who visited
the prison expressed astonishment and
said they had been led to believe by the
newspapers that the prison was a "hell on
earth," whereas they found it orderly and
clean. :; : .:t-'.-
Senator Shoup made such a statement,
and others were specified by the Gover
nor. As to the charges that an army had
placed the men on a standing line and had
called them "cowardly curs" the Gover
nor said he never heard of this action and
no complaint was ever made to him. The
prisoners were at one time placed by the
military on bread and water because of
an infraction of prison rules. :
Governor Steunenberg said he never
suspended the writ of habeas corpus, nor
was the writ otherwise suspended. Spe
cific writs were denied by the courts, but
this did not operate as a general suspen
sion of this process. â¢ To the charge that
free speech was suppressed the Governor
said he had given notice that a memorial
service commemorating a fight between
the union and non-union men in 1892,
when the Frisco mill was blown up,
should not be held while the community
was In such an excited state. There was
no interference with the decorating of
miners' graves, as had been charged. On
the charge that the free press was sup
pressed the Governor said the only Inter
ference was with the Mullen Mirror be
cause of Inflammatory publications calcu
lated to arouse further trouble.
Union Men Allowed to Meet.
Governor Steunenberg denied that the
meetings of labor unions were prohibited.
There were - many union men In the dis
trict and they were free to hold meetings.
He characterized as outrageous the
charge that the Bunker Hill mine and
other organizations had dictated the pol
icy of the State. This policy, he said, was
dictated solely by a desire to give to a
county that security and order It had not
enjoyed in ten years. Many of General
Merriam's dispatches and reports were
read and Governor Steunenberg confirmed
most of the statements made. He also
reaffirmed that the disorder was caused
by criminal and anarchistic organiza
tions cloaking themselves as labor organ
izations and having none of the alms of
the great body of labor organizations.
Governor Steunenber^s closing state
ment of the day attracted much attention
for Its vivid recital of a series of lawless
depredations In the ? Coetir d'Alenes,
which, he said, had spread through thÂ©
community. He stated that the house of
the Judge of the First District. Judge
Mayhew, had been entered at night by an
armed and masked man, who wanted to
*now how a ruling of the court was to be
made. On another occasion an armed
mob waited on a Judge and told him he
had "better, rule right." The Governor
said fifty citizens had told him that their
lives would be worth nothing if It be
came known that they had disclosed acts
of lawlessness which occurred.

Mrs. F. A. Thornhill was passing the
market at the time with her two little
children, one of whom' was knocked down
by the crazed steed,. which finally kicked
itself loose from the 1 broken buggy and
started again on a wild run. For a short
distance the frightened animal galloped
along the crowded sidewalk and then to
the street, narrowly missing knocking
down several pedestrians.
Once on the street the horse zigzagged
among the passing teams and turned into
Kearny street, when at the corner of
Geary it knocked down two men and a
woman and then fell. Immediately the
animal was seized by Artie Coleman a
newsboy, who held it until it waa taken
charge, of by the police.
None of the last victims were seriously
hurt. Dr. A. B. Smith, who waa one of
them, claimed that a jarring was the ex

A RUNAWAY accident In which five
people were injured, fortunately
none seriously, occurred yesterday
afternoon on the busiest part of
Market street at an hour when the
street was filled with pedestrians and
passing teams. The runaway caused
great excitement, and for a time it was
thought that several persons had been,
killed. Considering the crowded condition
of the thorough/are, it seems little short
of- miraculous that there were no fatal
results. .
M. J. Savage, a contractor, residing at
2506 Van Ness avenue, was driving out
Market street yesterday afternoon at
about 5 o'clock, when half way between
Kearny 6treet and Grant avenue a wheel
of the buggy in which he was driving
came off and he was thrown out. The
horse started up Market street on a mad
run, and after going a short distance was
turned in its course by. the efforts of a
man, who grabbed the excited animal by
the bridle, but was unable to retain -his
hold long enough to stop the runaway.

A Certain Cure for Piles.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is a success be-
cause it has the merit which brings suc-
cess. It cures every form of piles and
cures them to stay cured. It is now the
most popular and best known pile rem-
edy before the public, and one reason for
its great popularity is because it has
taken the place of surgical operations,
once considered the only sure cure.
People often wonder that so simple a
remedy will so promptly cure such an
obstinate trouble aÂ» piles are well known
to be. Yet the greatest remedies and
greatest inventions we have are the sim-
plest, and the fact that it does cure is all
the sufferer from piles wants to know.
The Pyramid Pile Cure cures piles in
any rtage of the disease, as shown by the
following testimonial letters, which are
published every week and new cases re-
ported each time:
From Geo. C. Gelck, Owens Mill. Mo.:
"Some time ago I bought a package of
Pyramid Pile Cure for my wife, who had
suffered very much. The first trial did
her more good than anything she had
ever tried. It is just as represented."
From Richard Ivian, Whipple, Ohio: "I
have UFf-d the Pyramid and am entirely
pleased and eatisfio^l with results. It does
the work and no mistake."
Mr. W. R. Hines of Magnolia. ArJc.
rays: "Although I have used the Pyra-
mid Pile Cure only a very short time, yet
it has b<H>n very beneficial to m<Â»."
From Mrs. Peter L*ikÂ©. Mohavrk, N. T.:
"I received the Pyramid Pile Cure, but
put off using it until last week, when I
became so bad I decided to try it. I have
FUffered twenty-nine years with bleeding
piles and have used a great deal of medi-
cine, but never had anything that did so
much for me as your remedy."
The proprietors of this remedy could
publish columns of similar letters to the
above if necessary, but these are enough
to show what It will do In different cases.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is proparr-d by
the Pyramid Drug Co. of Marshall. Mich!.
and for sale by druggists everywhere at
I." rents per package. One package Is suf-
ficient to cure any ordinary case. Your
druggist will tell you more about It.

was capable of inflicting and that he did
not want a fatality in the ring.
The bout between Jack Kane and Jimmy
Lawlor was declared a draw by Referee
Jack Welch after twenty rounds of box
ing. The men were equally matched, Kane
displaying marked, improvement . over
the showing made by him in his last meet
ing with Lawlor. Lawlor's most effective
blow was a left overhand swing, which
generally scored on Kane's head. Lawlor
also scored frequently with a kidney
punch, which took some of the steam out
of his opponent. Kane had a lead in the
earlier rounds, but Lawlor overcame this
in the latter stages of the twenty-round
journey.
The work was all clean and clever, both
boxers taking advantage of every open
ing. Kane knocked Lawlor clean off his
feet in the third round and was himself
wrestled down in the sixth. The draw de
cision was a popular one.
The preliminary bout between "Kid"
Dobson and Mike Welsh served to put
the spectators in good humor. Neither
displayed any science, but both were busy
from start to finish. Welsh was game
and aggressive, and although he could
not hurt Dobson he made him want to
quit. Dobson went down in the eighth
round without being hit, and Referee J.
A. McGlnley gave the decision to Welsh
for this reason. The bout was a rough-

DRAG-HUNTING
SEASON WILL
SOON BE OVER
Lack of Rain Makes Very
Hard Going In San
Mateo.
On Monday last a live fox was released
in the Sharon field, and. after some start
had been allowed him. Huntsman Jerry
Keating laid the pack of San Mateo
County Hunt on, the riders who followed
the hounds being F. J. Carolan. M. F. H..
J. J. Moore. E. D. Beylard. George Par
sons and Peter Martin. The scent was
quickly picked up and at the Brewer
ranch the hounds were so close upon the
trail that the fox took refuse in a tree.
The pack was whipped off. and a few
minutes' start given the fox. He ran
for the foothills through country af
fording some stiff fences. After eluding
capture for four miles, he reached the
Spring Valley reservoir and there was
killed After fifteen minutes the hounds
were laid on a drag and a hard run
through the Howard property ensued,
the finish being at the back of GÂ«orse
Howard's house. On Wednesday there
was a meet at Laurel Creek at 1:30 p. m..
but as usual on that day, the field was
small. To-day the meet Is at the Cross
Ways at Burlingame at 3p. m. It is pos
sible this may be the last regular hunt
of the season, owing to the little rain
that has fallen for several weeks, the
ground having become sÂ»o hard that a
long run is trying on the horses. Then,
too F. J. Carolan, the master of the
hunt leaves this cltv for the East to
night. There will probably be a few runs
after live foxes, the park being in charge
of Jerry Keating.

GOLF CONTESTS
FOR STANFORD
AND BERKELEY
Clubs of Northern California
to Unite in Forming an
Association.
California has earned an enviable repu
tation In the turf world for turning out
jockeys. Spencer, Jenkins. "Skoeta"
Martin and Bullman, a quartet of riders
hard to beat, all learned the rudimentary
elements of the art in this State, and now
when Eastern owners are in search of a
competent pilot their attention is directed
out this way. .The present season's finds
were Milt. Honry and Tod Walsh. The
former could bo termed self-made, for his
experience was gained riding any old sort
of a horse, for as many different owners.
His rise has been both rapid and remark
able. Tod Walsh's tuition was developed
under the eagle eye of "Butch" Fisher,
a painstaking and careful trainer. The
skill of the two lads mentioned did not
escape attention, for Henry was signed
by Barney Schreibnr and Walsh by the
New York turfman. L. V. Bell. When
President "Tom" Williams of the Califor
nia Jockey Club returned from the East
on Wednesday he said he had been asked
by "Jack" Follansbee to sign a promising
lightweight if one were available. The
stock is pretty low at present, though
the old-timer, Eddie Ross, has been doing
excellent work in the, saddle, and Ivy
Powell, too. with an opportunity, mlgh{
make a name for himself.
There Is a well-defined rumor going the
rounds that politician Ed Lanigan and
his trainer, Denny Lynch, have split. The
breach, it is said, was caused by the race
won at Tanforan by Hard Knot. Tho lat
ter horse was not supposed to be ready';
and Lanigan and his friends bet heavily
on Arbaces. Hard Knot, with Piggott
up, went out and won all the way, while
Stemler's big horse finlshpd a bad third.
Naming horses after clergymen may be
all right, but in reality it seems very bad
form. As a rule, the church and gamb
ling enterprises travel in different
grooves.
Alex. Shields and his son Willie are cer
tainly great conditioners of horses. Their
racing material sport the colors year in
and year out, in all sorts of weather and
all parts of the country, and, like old
wine, apparently Improve with age. Old
Logan never seemed to require a rest,
ana when finally retired, after his name
had been encased In over one hundred
brackets, looked liko a two-year-old.
Now Topmast and Advance Guard bid
fair to follow in his footsteps. The latter
colt, after his easy victory for the Pacific-
Union handicap on Thursday, when he
handled a bundle of weight, looms up a3
a promising Chicago Derby candidate.
Joe Plggott, who rode the three-year-old
In that race, thinks him a wonder, saying
he runs like a big green two-year-old,
almost developing a tendency to loaf and
play on the route.
Ed Corrlgan said some weeks ago In
an interview that he had no races put on
the card for his horses. Still it must be
admitted that his stake was singularly
successful at Tanforan Park. Up to date
his horses have won $22,2."j0. far overshad
owing any other stable. The big turfman
was not so fortunate in backing horses
owned by other stables, however, and ru
mor has It that he is not greatly pleased
with California's present racing season.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
It is probable that the third tournament
for the Council's cup for lades of the San
Francisco Golf Club will not be played
until the fall. Miss Alice Hoffman has al
ready won two tournaments, and If she
should win a third the cup would become
her permanent property. If a third tour
nament were held at an early date the
cup would be a gift to Miss Hoffman, as
it is not likely that any of her competitors
would Improve in their play sufficiently
to beat her, or that Miss Hoffman's game
would grow weak enough for her to lose.
Six months hence, however, some change
will have taken placo in the relative
strength of the contestants, and the com
petition will involve a larger element of
uncertainty and therefore of Interest than
at present. During the summer AusÂ»
i tollman will piay at the Ban Kaiuel linns.
ana other ladies of the ban iVraiiciaco tioif
Club will practice at Del Monte, Bur
hrigame ana elsewhere.
h.. K. 1' oiger ana C. P. Hubbard of the
OaKland Uuif Clud naving tied in tne
final round over thirty-six holes of tne
competition tor the championsnip of the
ban i?rancisco and Oakland Golf clubs, a
deciding game over eignteen holes was
played last Sunday on me Adams Point
course. At the end of the nrst round
Hubbard led at the fifteenth hole one up.
The sixteenth hole was nalved. i<olger
took the seventeenth and made the score
all even. At the eignteenth nole Hubbard
tailed to make a put of four feet, wnile
Folger holed the bull from a distance or:
ten feet, winning the play-off of the tie
one up and the cnampion&nip of the Oak
land and San Franci&co Golf clubs. It is
a pity that John Lawson, S. L. Abbott Jr.,
H. IS. Goodwin and other strong players
of the San Francisco Golf Club aid not
enter the contest, all the competitors in
which were Oaklanaers. Â¦ At the first com
petition held at the Presidio K. Conde
Jones of Los Angeles and N. W. Howard
of banta Catallnu entered the qualifying
rounus, and several San Francisco goifers
qualined, but the contest is far from being
a Pacific Coast criampionsnip event as
yet. Svhat is wanted is an association of
the golf clubs of Central and Northern
California similar to tne Southern Califor
nia Association, in wnich seven clubs are
associate members, and three are allied
members. 'i fie associate memoers are
the Country clubs of Los Angeles and
Pasadena, the Riverside Polo and Golt
Club and the Redlands, Santa Monica,
Pacha ppa and Hubldoux Golf clubs. The
allied members are the Coronado, Santa,
Catalina and Hemet Golf clubs. Tne pres
ident is C. K. Maud, who comes nearer be
ing a champion of all California than any
one else, he having won the open tourna
ment held last August at Del Monte. The
secretary Is J. F. Sartori of the Los An
geles Country Club. The *golf clubs of
Oregon, Washington and British Columbia
are already united in the Pacific North
west Golf Association, which held its first
annual championship meeting on the links
of the Tacoma Golf Club in April, I&P9,
and will hold Its second meeting on the
Waverley links at Portland at the end of
April. The association Includes the Spo
kane Country Club and the Waverley,
Seattle. Victoria and Tacoma Golf clubs.
The second double-barreled tournament
between teams of the San Francisco ana
Oakland Golf clubs Is the next local event
of Importance. The San Francisco repre
sentatives will be chosen from the follow
ing: John Lawson, H. B. Goodwin, R. H.

The California Baseball League will be
gin its third season to-morrow, since the
resurrection of the game after It had re
ceived a staggering blow through Jobbery.
So far this new league has been success
ful both financially and in the kind of ball
exhibited to the patrons.
The fact that the league Is composed of
but four clubs should not detract from In
terest In the game. The teams are com
posed of seasoned players and good base
ball should be the order from the start.
Some of the clubs have players on their
list who are a bit too seasonedâ ln fact
stale beyond redemptionâ but the man
agers promise to drop them if they are
not up to the standard.
Oakland begins the schedule with ap
parently the best team In the field. It is
practically the same aggregation that
Ewing had when he made such a splen
did showing in the final series last Octo
ber and November. As a fielding team it
stands out as the best of the four. San
Francisco is represented by ' some new
and many old men. Schwartz, the
catcher, has yet to prove himself; also
Spencer at shortstop. "Rube" Levy is
known to all, but what his value Is at
this late day is another question which
events must prove. The two new pitch
ers are Bevllle, Oakland, and Saulsbury,
Sacramento, both of whom will step upon
the diamond with fair reputations, which
will cither be enhanced or shattered as
the stick swingers fail or succeed In con
necting with their curves.
The games to-morrow will be played at
Recreation Park grounds and at Sacra
mento. There will be a presentation of
the pennant to Sacramento Just before the
umpire calls "game" when Stockton and
the Senators line up. A special train will
bo run from Stockton to Sacramento Sun
day morning.. The game in this city is
sure to draw a large crowd. The teams
will play in the following positions:

FISHERMEN ARE READY
FOR GAMEST OF TROUT
Hundreds of Anglers Will Line the Banks o
Coast Streams To-Morrow, the Opening
Day of the Season.
THE' eagerly looked forward to open
ing of the season In which trout may
be legally taken from the public
streams of the State has arrived. The
law's restraining hand will be removed
to-morrow, and he who will may catch
with hook and line such trout as his skill
may entice from their hiding, places In
quiet pools. The opening day falling upon
Sunday affords all anglers an equal op
portunity of getting out on the first day of
the season. It is believed there has been
less poaching than uÂ«ual, and aa the sea
son is well advanced there should be good
sport from the start. April fishing is never
what the angler's closed season dreams
have made it, yet when the opening day
arrives every enthusiast wends his way
to the stream of his choice, full of the
longing that has come from the five
months of restraint.
The past season has been a favorable
one for the coast trout streams, and good
catches may be expected on the opening
of the season in the principal streams of
Marin, Sonoma, . Mendocino and Santa
Cruz counties, provided the streams are
clear. The tlsh may be small, but they
should be numerous. The Lagunitas and
Paper Mill creeks and their tributaries In
Marin County will probably attract the
greatest number of nshermen because of
their accessibility. On N the opening day
of past seasons as high as two hundred
rods have been counted on theae two
streams, the majority of the fishermen
using shrimp, angle -worms and roe as
bait. Fishermen who visit the Mann
County streams this year should remem
ber that there is one ordinance in that
county which prohibits the catching or
possession of any trout under live inches
in length. The Marin County Fish ana
Game Protective Association haa been ac
tive during the winter in enforcing the
laws, and during the fishing months will
maintain a close watch for violations ot
this ordinance.
'ihe lishermen who journey into Sonoma
and Mendocino counties will find the
streams carrying mere water>than in past
years. luports from that section are all
lavorablf. lhÂ«i streams were well stocked

Moncay and Tuesday. Authorities on
rtsninir" afllrm that nothing is gained by
the passage of this ordinance. These
streams aie stocked from the sea. and as
all the tisli have spawned by April 1 the
closing of the season is of little benefit.
As none of the adjoining counties have
such a law, confusion Is sure to result.
The Santa Cruz County streams have
plenty of water this year, and the pros
pects for good fishing near Boulder Creek
and Felton. on the San Lorenzo and its
many tributaries, are excellent. The Los
Gatos, in Santa Clara County, San Jose's
favorite trout stream, is reported in good
condition, as is the .Laagus. The close sea
son here haa been well observed, owing to
the Santa Clara Protective Association,
which has maintained a patrol of this and
all the other trout streams of the county.
While the coast streams will receive full
consideration from the fishermen, the in
terest of the best known anglers natural
ly turns toward the big streams of the
Sierras, such a* the Truckee, American,
Yuba, Sacramento, McCloud and Kla
math. While none of these streams are
considered favorable April waters, they
furnish the real sport of the season for the
fly fishermen of the State. Of these bfg
streams the Klamath is the earliest. This
stream is usually fished near Klamath
Hot Springs. The rainbow of the Kla
math average larger in size than in any
other stream in the State, but it is said
of them that they are not as game nor
of as fine a flavor as those found in the
Sacramento and McCloud rivers. â¢.
Provided the April rains are not too
heavy, the Sacramento and McCloud
should be in good condition early this
year. Already the experts of the San
Francisco Fly Castlrfg Club are planning
a trip to the McCloud near the Govern
ment hatchery at Balrd, as the fishing
there Is much earlier than at the points
some forty miles above, where so many
sportsmen have large preserves.
The anglers who frequent the McCloud â
and they embrace every well-known fly
fisherman in the State â are not a little
concerned over the stories which come
from Reno to the effect that there is to
be a large electric-power plant established
on the river a few miles above the Gov
ernment hatchery at Balrd. It Is said
that the power company Intends by means
of a large dam to divert all the waters of
the river into a ditch and carry It thence
to the generators miles below. If this be
true. It will destroy several miles of the
best fishing waters of this most famous
fishing stream, as well as prevent the
salmon and big trout from ascending the
river. The Sacramento-River from Shasta
Soda Springs to Delta covers many miles
of fine water to the expert. This stream.
like the Truckee and Tuba, ha 3 been well
stocked during the past two years. The
fishing season on the Sacramento seldom
opens befoia May, but, as already sug
gested, the season this year bids fair to
be an early one. The fishing conditions
on the Truckee this coming season prom
ise to be the most favorable In years.
This groat stream has more dams In It
than any other river in the State and un
fortunately heretofore all of these dams
have not been provided with fish ladders.
The dam 3 In the California end of the
rtver have for years had ladders of more
or less efficiency, but the dams In the
river In Nevada have been without lad
ders, so the spawn tlsh could not pass up
the river. During last year this condition
was remedied. Owing to public demand
the dam owners built ladders and active
steps were taken to enforce the fish laws.
The result has been that the large spawn
fish have passed from Pyramid Lake.
New. up the Truckee River into thi3 State
for the first time In many years.
This movement of big fish will be of
benefit to the anglers, for besides deposit-
Ing their spawn on the head waters of the
river many of these big fish will loiter In
the. pools until taken out by the skill of
some fortunate angler. V.'ith the Im
provements on the dams in Nevada the
fishermen arf still uneasy regarding the
fishing in the rtver owing to the knowl
edge that the electric power company lo
cated on the Truckee just below Florlaton
has finished its <lam and Is at work on
the big flume that will -carry the greater
portion of the waters of the river from
Its channel to Mystic Hot Springs. on<Â»
and a half miles below. The capacity or
thin ditch more than equals the average
summer and fall How In the rtver. and
will. it. Is said, leave one and a half miles
of the present river bed dry. thus cutting
off one and a half miles of the best fishing
water. This Is a serious matter to many
anglers, but therÂ»* seems no remedy at
law, as the company owns both sides of
the river at this point. However, It is
hoped by many that this condition will
have little or no effect on the river above
Floriston. and the best of the river is
said to be above there, for the run of
spawn fish will pass the power plant on
the high water of the early spring, thus
assuring spawn for the hatcheries, from
which later the head waters can be
stocked. The fishing In the American
and the Tuba In the vicinity of Cisco -will
not begin before the end of June, while
July Is usually the best of the season.
Fishing In the waters of Yosemite Na
tional Park will probably attract many
more anglers this year than ever before,
as it Is more generally known that these
streams and lakes are now well stocked.
The anglers who go there will have rare
sport.

STANFORD fNIVRRBITY. March 30.â j
The jur.lor class festivities which were |
opened so auspiciously last night with
the? presentation of a farce, were contin
ued throughout the day by track, field
end baseball contests.
The interclass meet for the new cham
pionship cup drew the attention of a
large crowd of students and visitors to
the university oval. It was well known
that the contest lay between the juniors
ar.d freshmen, though both of the other
elates entered their teams. Every event
was sharply contested and the fight was
an or-en one till the last event, when
Symonds. of the Junior class, won the
day for his class by defeating Narraroore
In "the broad Jump by the narrow margin
of one inch.
From the standpoint of intercollegiate,
athletics the meet was a. most important
one. It shows that the cardinal athletes
are strong In the pole vault, mile waik,
the hundred and two-hundred-and-twen
ty-yard dashes, and may take some of the
coveted points in the quarter and half
mile runs hurdles and broad Jump. As
the result the Palo Alto men will enter
upon the last three weeks' training with
renewed hope and vigor.

A close and exciting game was played
on the Stanford campus this afternoon be
tween the Sar.ta Clara College team and
the 'Varsity. Each team scored In the
first Inning, ar.d nothing of moment oc
rurred until the fourth inning, when
Santa Clara by bunching their nits sent
seven men acroFS the rubber. After this
Sar.ta Clara had everything Its own way
until the ninth inning, when Stanford by
lhrr-r. hits and a. comedy of errors by San- I
ta Clara ran up seven runs.
The features of the game Â¦were the
steady pitching of Kelly, coupled with his
long drives and the opportune hitting of
Leake and Graham. Captain Graham
played his last game before departing for
the Western League. Score:

absence of Pitcher Martin, the Normals
nevertheless put up a good game. It was
evident from the beginning that they were

THE KENTUCKY TROUBLE.
THE outstanding reward of $100,000 for con
viction of the assassins of Goebel is likely to
secure the hanging of somebody, with the high
probability that the victim of hemp had nothing to
do with the crime he expiates. Mr. James Andrew
Scott, who seems by the latest news to be running
the business, is quoted as saying: "If Youtzey will
tell what I think he knows, he can hang Taylor and
destroy the Republican party. I can arrange for
er.ough of the appropriation for Youtzey to make
him and his wife comfortable for the rest of their
lives. Culton is going to confess in the morning,
and Youtzey had better get in while he can. The
money is going, and he might "as well have his share."
This pleasant language was addressed to the brother
in-law and father-in-law of Youtzey. Scott assured
them that if Youtzey did not get in Culton would
pet the entire $100,000. Youtzey's relatives only re
plied that he had nothing to tell, thereupon he was
;>ut under arrest.
We doubt whether such an exhibition was ever
made in modern times before. There is something
inexplicable in the conduct of GoebeTs friends. They
refused to permit a post-mortem, or any examina
tion of his body, to show .whether he was shot in the
front or back. To inculpate Republican State officers
it is necessary to make it appear that the shots came
from the front, but those officers, by refusal of a
post-mortem, are deprived of the defense they would
have if he were shot in the back. This fact, coupled
with the cold-blooded proposition of Scott to use the
State appropriation to pay for testimony that will de
stroy the Republican party by hangirig Governor Tay
lor, shadows the whole thing with mystery and sus
picion. It is known that Taylor was ejected by a
majority of 40.000. and that this was reversed by the
use of the Gnebel law. and now if Tirylor can be
hanged, as well as cheated out of his office, Kentucky
will add a very undesirable load to her already pe
rr.liar reprtation.
AMERICAN TAXES ON SHIPPING.
DAVID A. WELLS for several years before his
death was engaged in preparing* a work on
taxation designed to contain a record of his
experience in assisting to shape State and. national
taxes, and of the conclusions drawn from that expe
rience and from his study of taxation in other coun
tries. The work has recently been published, and
contains much information of value to legislators who
desire to give to the people of the United States a
well ordered system of taxation instead of the con
fused burdens which are now imposed upon indus
try and enterprise without yielding any adequate re
turn of revenue.
Among the examples of foolish and hurtful taxes
which Mr. Wells cites none is more worthy of note
than the shipping taxes which oppress our commerce.
On that subject Mr. Wells says: "Boards of Trade
and commercial conventions may pass deploring reso
lutions concerning the decay of American commerce,
and committees of Congress may continue to inves
tigate the same subject, but so long as ships engaged
in the carrying trade on the free ocean, and owned in
Canada, Great Britain, France, Germany and Hol
land, arc not directly taxed, and ships engaged in
competition in the same business and owned in -Bos-^
ton, Portland, New Orleans and San Francisco, are
taxed, and taxed heavily, commerce will incline to
move in the paths made easy and profitable to it.
The difference in cost of a single penny per bushel, in
laying down grain at Liverpool. may alone be deter
minative of the question whether millions'of buchela
The seductive chase for gold has induced many of
our Chinese highbinder citizens to leave the city for
the north. There is every reason to believe therefore
that the gold camps of the north will not suffer from
lack of excitement.
ONE NUISANCE SUPPRESSED.
IN these days of fiasco municipal administration,
when we have to put up with streets 1 unlighted
after midnight, and merchants have to arrange to
have the streets sprinkled largely at their own ex
pense, every step taken toward a genuine improve
ment in any direction, or to the suppression of a
nuisance, is a matter of more than ordinary gratifi
cation. It will therefore be pleasing to the public to
learn that the.Board of Health and the Chief of Po
lice have determined to put an end to the practice of
scavengers hauling the refuse of the city through the
principal streets during the busy hours of the day.
and also to forbid them from carrying off the
scavenge in uncovered carts at any time.
The nuisance resulting from the practice was one
of the most serious in the city, and was the more to
be condemned because it was in , violation of the,
law. It was a practice, moreover, that was well nigh
universal. Probably every scavenger ,in the city vio
lated the ordinance requiring, a .heavy, and suitable
cover to be attached to his cart. When The Call ex
ploited the nuisance :it found* the carts going about
the thronged streets. with. hardly a pretense of cover
ing, and the law ignored # as Jf.it .were not.
The new .rule' requiring the scavengers to haul the
refuse from the city between the hours of 10 p. m.
and 6 a. m., taken with the determination to enforce
the ordinance requiring carts to be covered, will re
lieve the public of a nuisance which was a serious
menace to health as well as being offensive even when
not dangerous. The: prompt response" of the offi
cials to the crusade of The Call against the evicts
gratifying, and it is to be hoped the new policy
will be adhered to "steadfastly hereafter. .

OUR BIOGRAPHICAL STUDIES.
OF the courses of Home Study now running in
The Call none have been found more generally
interesting than the series of biographical
sketches of famous women. Though these articles
have been prepared mainly for girls and young
women, with the object of interesting them in his
toric subjects and instructing them in what has been
achieved by great women of the past, they can be
read with advantage by all classes who have an intel
ligent sympathy with genius.
The scries is under the direction of Mrs. Charlotte
Brewslcr Jordan, whose sketches of Royal Women
of European History have won for her a wide repute
in the literary world. It includes seventeen papers
and deals with noted women of such widely varied
talents and lives as Joan of Arc, Vittoria Colonna,
Angelica Kauffman, Caroline Herschel, Sarah Kem
ble Siddons, Mme. Le Brun, Mary Lamb, Charlotte
Corday, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Fry, Harriet Marti
â¢ neau, Margaret Fuller, Charlotte Cushman, Jenny
Lind, Rosa Bonheur, Florence Nightingale and
Louisa M. Alcott.
It will be seen the list includes women who have
attained distinction in nearly all lines of human en
deavor, from war, in which Joan of Arc stands pre
eminent, to the deeds of charity which have rendered
the name of Elizabeth Fry forever memorable in the
annals of the English race. Every reader can learn
something new and of permanent interest in this
course and derive from it a higher appreciation of
the work which women have done in promoting the
welfare of humanity.
Many of the papers in the series have been already
published, but those which 2re yet to come are fully
es interesting as any that have gone before. If there
be any readers of The Call who have not yet given at
tention to this series of studies, they will do well to
begin at once. Hardly any item of the news of the
day Is of more value than these studies or will better
repay the time spent in reading. Each article of the
set is complete in itself, and presents a critical and
historical essay by an author of established repute on
a subject which has the double attraction of his
toric value and personal interest.

CONDEMNED BY THE PRESS
How the State Has Been Made to Pay in
Money and Reputation for a Piece
of Sensational Journalism.
San Francisco Wave.
The bubonic plague scare, absolutely unreasonable and unwarranted, prom
ises to turn out the most expensive piece of political work ever done in San Fran
cisco. It is proving a\very bad business every way, and its effects are not lia
ble to be forgotten for ntonths to dome. Simply because one Chinaman was
found dead of a disease which has certain symptoms In common with bubonic
plague, Chinatown was quarantined and the Information telegraphed to the world
that the dread aliment had broken out in the Californian metropolis. This sum
mary action taken on a suspicion has quarantined San Francisco and turned
thousands away from the city.
The effort to participate in the Cape Nome business being made by a few
of the more enterprising of Californian merchants is nullified by the same
scare. In a hundred other ways it Is operating to the disadvantage of San Fran
cisco. If there had really been a cas* of bubonic plague there, if the action
of the Board of Health had been justified by subsequent developments, one pisht
find some excuse, but that the California metropolis should have been blackened
and injured for no good reason whatever is shameful. In a city in which public
opinion was a factor some measures would have been taken ere this to neutra
lize the effects of the Board of Health's rashness. As it is, the Examiner-Jour
nal has spread the news broadcast, and while its announcement In either organ
may discredit the scare among the intelligent, their circulation is In the ranks of
the ignorant, who. doubtless accept its aggravated and black-faced fictions as
Berkeley Daily Gazette.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The offense charged against the New York Journal is that It published
In an exceedingly conspicuous and continuous manner that San Francisco was
plague-ridden, and did not attempt correction after it was known that the city
was not plague quarantined. The result is that vessels from this port have been
put in quarantine at other ports, wholesale traffic is being injured and tourists
scared out of Northern California. Thus the city is made to suffer an injustice.
In a sense the suffering is a just retribution for the sin of patronizing and build
ing up yellow journalism, to which, the city has learned, nothing Is sacred or too
valuable or good to be defamed, pictured with mud cuts and defiled by contam
ination with the columns of a sacrilegious and defamatory sheet. But the pun
ishment is too severe, and reaches the innocent as well as the guilty. The whole
coast is suffering from these false alarms, and will continue to do so for some time
to come It Is taking some severe lessons to teach the public to discriminate be
tween a journal which prefers fiction to fact and vice versa.

San Francisco has been suffering from too much Phelan. The Mayor's Board
of Health and the Examiner, aided and abetted by the New York Journal, have
been advertising to the world that San Francisco is afflicted with bubonic
plague. The East became alarmed- and the alarm ; was exaggerated by false
dispatches On Monday a delegation from the Merchants' "Association waited on'
Mayor Phelan, and to prevent the holding of a public meeting by that associa
tion denouncing the municipal executive that official agreed to send out a dis
patch to forty cities of the tJnited States denying the sensational stories that had
teen published. This may stop the evil report from growing, but will not cure
the curse of it. San Francisco needs to be disinfected from something worse
than bubonic plagueâ and that is Phelantem.^
, . Stockton Record.
The reproaches of the kettle by the Censorious pot find their parallel In San
Francisco, where people's feelings have been lacerated by learning that yellow
Eastern papers have repeated and enlarged upon home-made lies about the
bubonic fever in that city. The lie Is an official invention. The inventors didn't
imagine it was such a rapid-fire, long-distance explosive, or they wouldn't have
invented it. When It went off and the echo in a New York edition of the San
TrVaTi^Â«pn Fvareerator proved to be megaphonic, all San Francisco kicked and
Ma"or Phelan B offlciaU y P denied in words what his Board of Health had officially
proclaimed in word and deed and officially reaffirmed. Although that absurd
?tate of affairs Is just what men of ordinary sense could have foreseen as the
i-Mult of re-electing Phelan, thousands of those who voted for him declaim against
it as if they were in no way responsible. Those who made the loudest outcry
were the "business element" who were the most active in support of Phelan.
THE INTERESTS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
THE commercial aspirations of San Francisco
reach westward, to Asia. China and Japan
offer the most profitable and inviting field.
China is the better of the two, because of its larger
and more productive population. Li Hung Chang is
authority for the statement that China has reached
the limit of her food supply, and must look to the
nearest nation that produces a surplus of food to
supplement her decreasing resources.
So well is this aspiration of the Pacific Coast un
derstood that there is a bill now before Congress to
appoint an American commission to proceed to China
and Japan and make a study of those markets, their
requirements and their exchange capacity in com
merce. .
In 1898 China imported $146,077,000 worth :of
goods, or 36.5 cents per capita of her people. Of this
the United States sold to her $20,000,000. China has
now thirty-one open ports, each' one an open door
to our trade. This country is favored in China for
the reason that we have respected her territorial in
tegrity. While the other commercial nations have
seized ports and zones of territory and spheres of in
fluence by craft or violence, we have been content to
rest our relations and commerce with her upon
wholly natural conditions and upon a policy that has
not injured her national pride and self-respect. In an-:
other direction, however, we are undoing for San
Francisco what this national policy has accomplished.
Our Chinese trade from this port has spread through
the settlement here of Chinese merchants. These
Chinese business men pay one-third the tariff taxes
collected in this district on importations. An im
porter is also an exporter. These Chinese merchants
have already done and are daily doing exactly the
work to be charged upon the commission which Con
gress is about to authorize. They understand in it 3
minutest detail the Chinese market; they know what
American product that market will take, and in what
shape it must go to the consumer there. In its be
ginning the trade of this country with China was in
silks and teas. It was promoted by resident Ameri
can merchants in China, who understood the Ameri
can market, and its taste as to quality, its capacity
as to quantity and its requirements as to times and
seasons. In other words, we were in the beginning
importers from China, and our merchants, located
there, knew our market and catered to it. Now China
is an importer from this country, and the Chinese
merchants have settled here as American merchants
did there, and are wise in the needs of their native
market. It has been said, and truly, that if we want
this export trade to China we must be mindful of the
resident Chinese merchant. If we expel him we ex
pel the Chinese export trade of San Francisco. It
has been for some time apparent that application of
our very proper law and treaty regulations against
laborers to merchants is working against the Chinese
trade of San Francisco. Our commercial rivals- on
the north understand this, and as we increase our
policy of illiberality to Chinese merchants, they
broaden their hospitality to that class. Recently the
merchants of this city, who begin to feel the pressure
of this policy, held a conference with Mr. Ho Vow,
the Chinese Consul, and appointed a committee to
suggest an intelligent administration of our exclu
sion laws, so as rigidly to exclude coolie laborers,
according to the necessary purpose of those laws, but
at the same time to secure the merchants the rights
guaranteed to them by our laws and treaties. Forty
years ago Japan had no appreciable imports. Now
her imports are over $3.00 per capita, of which we
sold to her 14 per cent and Great Britain 22 per
cent. It is easily possible for China in a short time
to increase her imports to the same per capita as
Japan, and that would mean an annual importation
into China of $1,200,000,000. Granting that we do not
increase our percentage of that trade, the increase
would mean to us an annual export of $168,000,000.
If San Francisco do not get the most of it, the fault
will be ours.
In view of this it is rather discouraging to San
Francisco commerce to see the Examiner stigmatize
the effort to keep for Chinese merchants their plain
rights under the treaty as an attack on the laws which
exclude Chinese coolie labor. The Examiner's attack
holds over every merchant the shadow of libel and
abuse and the threat of boycott in his trade, unless he
consents to dump Chinese merchants and coolie la
borers all in one. class and thereby drive away our
Chinese trade by the denial of treaty rights to the
Chinese merchants who are building it up.
Any one wise in commerce knows that if we desire
an export trade to India its best promoters would be
Parsee merchants from Bombay, who might be in
duced to found houses here and become buyers of
our products to export to the markets whose needs
they know.
The interests of this city require attention to- these
matters, and those interested are injured by injecting
the Chinese labor question into Chinese trade. We
suppose that no discipline can reach Hearst's two
papers to make them either truthful, decent or re
spectful of the highest interests of this city and State,
and men who have those interests at heart , should
proceed in disregard of the fantastic lying and sen
sational follies of Hearst's sheets. .

ORGANIZERS OF THE
COMMERCIAL MUSEUM
Dr. W. P. Wilson and William Har
per of Philadelphia Tell of Sue- â¢
cess in the East.
Dr. William P. "Wilson, director of thÂ«
Philadelphia Commercial Museum, and his
colleague. William Harper, chief of the
bureau of information of the same Insti
tution, arrived last night from the East
and have been given apartments at tht>
Palace as guests of the city. They were
met on approaching the city by a com
mittee of prominent citizens headed by
Mayor Phefan and escorted to the Palace
in carriages. They will remain only until
Monday, when they must return eastward.
They have come to assist in the organiza
tion of the Pacific Commercial Museum.
In an interview Dr. Wilson stated that
the Philadelphia Museum, organized in
1594, had grown farther and faster than Its
organizers had ever dreamed of. Its aim
Is to study and develop foreign tradeâ not
only to find a market for American prod
ducts but to reciprocate by finding a mar
ket In America for foreign products not
manufactured here. The city of Phila
delphia at first backed the museum, but j
now it has become such a matter of inter
national importance that Congress has
appropriated a large amount of money to
aid In its work. Philadelphia donated six
teen acres of land near the business cen
ter, valued at $730,000, upon which build
ings to the value of J1.000.000 have already
been erected, and plans are ready for more
buildings that will cost as much again.
The buildings when completed will cover
the whole ground. Philadelphia appro
priates $113,000 annually to support the
museum. While the information supplied
to, manufacturers and producers is tac
tically free, "the museum realized $71,C0<r
last year from voluntary contributions. Â¦
"The greatest obstacle to our foreign
trade," said Dr. Wheeler, "is that we do
not know what is required in foreign
countries. This 13 what the museum tries
to find out and supply to interested peo
ple. We employ from 160 to ISO clerks.

â¢ "There should certainly be a commercial

portunity 13 a glorious one."
THE PACIFIC COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
WHEN it was learned in Philadelphia that a
project had been formed in this city to estab
lish a Pacific Coast Commercial Museum
along lines similar to those upon which the great in
stitution in that city has been so successfully con
ducted, it at once occurred to the people there that
the prestige of their own museum would be largely
increased if the one in San Francisco should be an
nexed to it as a subordinate or branch institution.
This idea took such firm hold upon the minds of a
good many Philadelphians that they have come to
believe it to be true, and accordingly they refer to
our museum as a purely local enterprise quite as a
matter of course. Thus the Philadelphia Inquirer, in
commenting upon the Pacific Coast project, recently
informed its readers: "While the Philadelphia Com
mercial Museum is planned on a national scale and
is local in name only, the Pacific is intended to ex
ploit Western trade especially, and is only incidentally
a national affair."
Since that is the attitude which the Philadelphians
have taken toward the Pacific Coast museum, it will
bz well to disabuse their minds on the subject. The
Pacific Coast cannot afford in this, nor in any other
great enterprise, to admit the doctrine that the East
is national and the West is merely local. So long as
such ideas prevail we shall be handicapped in every
effort we make for advancement, either at home or
abroad. The Pacific Coast is as national as the At
lantic Coast, and, moreover, has now grown suffi
ciently strong to assert itself in commerce, industry
and politics.
The issue whether our museum is to be indepen
dent or subordinate is not one of prestige merely. If
the Pacific Coast museum be a self-centered insti
tution, national in its scope, it will be entitled, like
that of Philadelphia, to governmental aid, but if it
be but a branch of the Eastern institution, it can ex
pect none. That fact is made clear by the Inquirer
itself in the statement: "There is before Congress â
or at least there will be, for the Committee on Inter
state and foreign Commerce with but a solitary
objection has agreed to it â a bill appropriating $200,
000 for the Philadelphia museum. The friends of
the California enterprise are asking that $50,000 shall
be tacked on to this bill for their own use. They
hope, by taking advantage of the prestige won by
the older enterprise, to secure money for the new
one. There is small justice in such an attempt.
If the California concern was national in its scope
we would wish it hearty success and give it a 'bless
you' with emphasis. But it is only intended for the
exploitation of local products. Its value is purely
local, and therefore not a proper subject for national
support."
The promoters of the Pacific museum can hardly
be oblivious to the importance of this question,'
which they will have to determine at the very outset
of their enterprise. .Doubtless Philadelphia can offer
many inducements for" us to accept the position of a
Western agency of their museum, but to renounce
independence for the sake of them will be much like
selling a birthright of nationalism for a mess of pot-
It is said that the coming of Collis P. Huntingdon
to this city will mark not only the obliteration of the
influence of Stanford and Crocker from the South
ern Pacific Company, but will evenblot out the very
names of these men from the great corporation. If
this be a fact it should suggest a deeply significant
theme for a historian of Californian affairs.
shall be supplied by the wheat fields of' the United
States or those of Russia, India or Hungary-"
The comparative burdens of the taxation of ship
ping in the United States and in the maritime states
of Europe are thus stated: "Portland, Maine, levied
more taxes' in the year 1893 on its shipping, valued at
$909,000, than tHe Cunard Company paid; to Great
Britain in the- same year on ships valued at nearly
$9,000,000! The taxation of shipping at Charleston is
five times heavier than that levied by Great Britain
or Germany. During the year 1893 the city of San
Francisco levied taxes to the amount of $85,675 on its
shipping â a sum within $600 of the combined taxes
paid during the same year by the Cunard line, the
Hamburg-American line, the North German Lloyd
and the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique of
France to their respective* Governments, their com
bined shipping comprising.upward of 700,000 tons of
the best steel and iron steamship]*; valued at upward
of $58,000,000." -.V
Such figures as these carry their moral on the
face. When to them it is added that the Governments
of the maritime nations of Europe grant liberal sub
sidies to their merchant marine, it is not to be won
dered that our shipping industry languishes and that
of our own ocean commerce we carry but a petty per
centage, leaving the rich and increasing profits of the
trade to be reaped by the ship-owners of other na
tions. It is. evident that if we are to compete on
equal terms' with foreigners in the commerce of the
world, we shall have to make a radical change in our
methods of treating our merchant marine.

among the admiring astronomers of; all
countries.
By this time her self-abnegation waa
so complete that the joys of youth, tha
drawbacks of age, were alike unnoted be
cause of her absorption in her brother**
life work. She resented fiercely all prais*
of herself which might detract from her
brother's fame ana writes with all sin
cerity: "I have done nothing; all I am.
ail 1 know,' I owe to my brother. I am
only a tool which he -shaped to his use â
a well-trained puppy dog would have dona
as much."
The many distinguished visitors, -wh.o
came to the house after the discovery of
the Georgian satellitesâ l7S6-STâ did not
agree with Caroline's modest- estimate of
herself. So that when. In 1757. the salary
or the astronomer royal was doubled tha
modest sum of Â£50 annually was settled
upon Caroline as assistant astronomer.
Her Joy. however, over this unprecedent
ed action in the history of science and
the possession of the tirst money, most
irregularly paid, which Bhe had ever been,
able to spend to her liking, was soon
clouded by the first real trial of hsr life.
That spring her brother William mar
ried; although his wife became Caro
line s lifelong friend, it was a great blow
to a woman whose 38 years had been so
lived in her brother's llfs to bÂ© thus rele
gated to a second place. Although bit
terly lonely in her lodglng-s, she neverthe
less worked untiringly, not for the saks
of science, but for the sake of the brother
who had trained her to believe that as
tronomy was the only branch of science
worth studying. She but thinly veils her
contempt of other studies when she write 3
of her brother Dietrich: "He amuse 3
himself with insects; it Is well he does
not see the word 'amuses.' for whenever
he catches a fly with a leg more than us
ual he says it Is as good as catching' a
comet."
Caroline Herschel discovered the ma
jority of her comets after her brother's
marriage. Nevertheless, she still spent
many nights star-gazing with him. rough
ly Jotting down his observations, and at
dawn hastening to her cottage, where she
worked until breakfast, in order to send
her brother a fair copy of the nlghfa
work, together with thÂ© working plan for
the following evening. Sometimes, when
Mrs. Hersch*>l would be absent for a
month with her only son, to whom Caro
line was always devoted, the sister would
come to her brother's home, working
night after night with him Jn the dear
old way. Indeed, had It not been for the
frequent cloudy evenings these laborers
by day and night would not have been able
to stand the unresting strain of so many
years. As It was. Sir William Herschel's
iron frame succumbed prematurely to the
outrageous treatment which It constantly
received, and he died in 1522. England was
no longer Kngland now that the brother
who brought her thither was gone, and
the broken-hearted sister returned, at the
apÂ« of 72, to Hanover, where she lived
twenty-six years. Still faithful to her
task ct "minding the heavens" for her
brother, she completed some of his most
important works in her native land. The
reduction and arrangement In the form
of a catalogue In zones of all the star
clusters and nebulae observed by Sir W.
Herschel In his sweeps won for her in
IS2S, at the age of 7S. the gold medal of
the Royal Astronomical Society. She
also wrote many other catalogues and
indexes invaluable to astronomers, who
can but appreciate the unremitting In
tellectual activity which produced them.
She worked slowly, as though she had
nearly a century In which to be painstak
ing.
The pleasures of her later yeara were
found in music, and she retained to the
last her enthusiasm for great musical
performers and composers. Her life waa
so simple that It wa3 with great difficulty
that she could spend one-half or the an
nuity of Â£100 which Sir William Herschel
left her. Her dearest Joy was in the
achievements of her Illustrious nephew,
the beloved brother's only child. Sir John
Herschel. an unusual example of the ge
nius of the father descending to the suc
ceeding generation. Sir John Herschel
ably carried on the great work which
his father had begun, and through his
original researches Kept the name of Her
schel foremost in science for a century,
dating from Sir William's discovery of
the Georeium Sidus to Sir John's death,
nearly 100 years later. When Sir John
Herschel came to announce to his vener
able aunt his Intended visit to the Cape
of Good Hope in order to study the south
ern heavens she cried out. eagerly: "Were
I but thirty or forty years younger, in
GoJ'9 name, I would go. too:"
When Sir John Herschel returned to
Hanover four years later, bringing thÂ«
little William Herschel. named for tho
pioneer astronomer, to see his great-aunt,
the aged woman felt greatly blessed. Her
last peaceful years were brightened by
manv kindnesses from the Hanoverian
royal family, and the reverent affection
of her contemporaries and kindred, who
upon her death, in 1?4S. placed this char
acteristic inscription to her memory: "The
eyes of her who was glorified were here
below turned to the starry heavens. Her
own discoveries of comets and tier par
ticipation in the Immortal labors of her
brother, William Herschel. bear witness
of this to future ages."

complishments, drudgery her profession.
Her reading, writing, the rudiments of
music and an occasional lesson on the vio
lin she learned from her father when her
mother was away or In an unusually good
humor. The fact that Caroline Herschel
gained what little education she possessed
under such discouraging circumstances,
oftentimes when worn out with her duties
as the Cinderella of the family, shows
that she must have possessed a naturally
good mind and great versatility, as well
as great perseverance.
England was at this time under the rule
of the Hanoverian Kings, and the Her
schel boys journeyed thither as members
of the band of which their father was
master. These professional visits ended in
William Herschel's establishing himself as
organist and music master at Bath. This
was a severe blow to the little Caroline,
who found the tedium of household duties
almost insufferable without the compan
ionship of her idol and hero, whom she
; frankly called her "dearest brother."
Upon his return, five years later, Caroline
was in a tremor of anticipation and more
than ever begrudged the daily routine
which deprived her of so much of this
visit.
Shortly after William's return to Bath,
where he followed the trade of musician
merely to obtain the means of studying
his beloved astronomy, his father died,
leaving the family in greatly straitened
circumstances. For the next five years
mother and daughter slaved to keep the
oldest brother, Jacob, in his former lux
ury. Then William bethought himself to
secure the valuable services of his young
er sister, and sent for her to Join him in
Kngland.
Her training in Germany formed an ex
cellent basis for her self-effacement in
England. Here the work was quite as
heavy, but varied by scientific tasks in
which she proved an apt apprentice. This
apprenticeship was sweetened by her
brothers approbation and the Increasing
consciousness that she could give him
more invaluable help than any one else in
the world.
At William's bidding she first took up
music, developing a remarkable talent for
singing, which would have justified her
career as a prima donna had she not at
her greatest proficiency been obliged to
stifle all longings for individuality and
identify herself still more intimately with
her brother's specialty. When not em
ployed In seconding his Inventions or in
defatigably polishing the mirrors for his
great telescopes, she copied the scores of
"The Messiah" and "Judas Maccabeus"
into parts for an orchestra of nearly 100
pieces, drilled the singers for the Lenten
oratorios in which she was the soloist and
sang frequently in concert. She was in
vited to take part in the Birmingham fes
tival, but declined to sing publicly where
her brother was not the conductor. Her
last public appearance was in 1782 in an
anthem composed by William Herschel.
She combined music with housekeeping
and science solely that she might eke out
her brother's earnings and lift him out of
the bread-winning stage into the realm of
pure science. It was therefore a keen dis
appointment to her to lay aside her one
accomplishment in order to concentrate
her power upon mature scientific work.
It is a noteworthy fact that the Her
schels arrived at science by the road of
music: for the kindred exactness in the
two branches appealed to their mental
precision. . .
William Herschel's fame as a musician
and composer was soon exchanged for
that of astronomical discoverer and In
ventor. His wonderful forty-foot tele
scope, the discovery of the planet Geor
gium Sldus in 1781 and of a volcanic moun
tain in the moon In 1753 made him the
leading authority in Europe and caused
his appointment as astronomer royal in
1753. The modest salary of Â£200 allowed
him by George 111 was much less than
he had earned from his forty weekly mu
sic lessons and position as organist, but
he welcomed the change, for he gained in
uninterrupted time what he lost in money.
The brother and sister now removed to
Datchet. and there their life was even
busier than before. In recognition of his
sister's devotion William Herschel now
delighted her by presenting her with a
telescope, a "seven-foot Newtonian
sweeper." With this instrument she
faithfully swept the heavens during her
brother's enforced absence at court,
bringing herself after some rebellion of
spirit to spend night after night on dewy
or frosted grass plat with no one within
call She soon overcame her repugnance
to the loneliness of this work by reflecting
that not far away her beloved brother
was at the same time making observa
tions upon double stars or planets, and
this sense of nearness encouraged her to
work away on the nebulae or star clus
ters which she intended to catalogue.
Once upon discovering a comet, she had
the pleasure of writing this fact to her
brother, her letter crossing the following
diary-letter from him :
Dear Llna: Aug. :l.â l counted 100 nebulae
to-day and this evening I saw an object which
I believe will prove to-morrow nlsht to be a
comet 2d.â To-night I calculated 150 nebulae.
I fear It will not bo clear to-night. One
o'clock âThe object of last night lÂ» a comet.
It seems, however, from several con
gratulatory; letters received from noted
astronomers that to Caroline belonged the
priority of observing this, the first of the
eight comets which she discovered.
With this enthusiastic brother Caroline
Herschel braved the roughest weather,
noting the right' ascensions and polar dis
tances of the objects observed while the
ink froze in the bottle, helping regularly
in his numerical calculations and . reduc
tions and only . during his absence â¢ using
the prized Newtonian sweeper," and get
ting through an amount of independent.'
orisinal work â¢ that caused amazement

CLEVER TRICK OF A
BOY OYSTER OPENER
His Employer Swears to a Warrant
-for His Arrest for Petty
Larceny.
N. K. Eustathlw has an oyster grotto at
126 .Third street. About a week ago he
advertised for a boy to open oysters, and
Manuel Sallchi got the Job. He proved a
willing worker and enjoyed the confidence
of his employer.
Thursday evening Manuel came hurried
ly Into the grotto and said to Eustathlw:
"Say, there s a fellow across the street
who has bet me $3 that I can't show $50.
Now, you give me the $50 and I'll win the
bet, and we can divide the $5."
Eustathiw got the $50 from his cash
drawer and handed it to Manuel, who hur
riedly left the grotto, but did not return.
Eustathiw patiently waited till yesterday
morning, when he went to Judge Mogan's
court and swore out a warrant for Man
uel's arrest on a charge of petty larceny.

ATHLETICS IN
SCHOOLS TO BE
RECOMMENDED
Superintendent Webster in
Favor of Swimming and
Boxing.
Advocates the Erection of Gymna
siums and Tanks for Physical
Culture in the New
Schoolhouses.
The announced intention of the Board of
Education to add cooking, sewing and
carpentering in the curriculum of the
School Department meets with the un
qualified indorsement of Superintendent
Webster, who expresses himself also as
being heartily in favor of establishing a
system of manual training in the schools
for the benefit of all the pupils.
Superintendent Webster will recommend
i nhis next report to the board that fa
cilities for the physical improvement of
pupils be established in tha new school
houses which are to be built with moneys
raised on the bonds to be Issued for that
purpose. He will advocate the installa
tion of a complete gymnasium, where
boxing lessons and other athletic exer
cises may be taught by competent in
structors. He will also recommend that
swimming tanks be built in connection
with the school houses where pupils may
perfect themselves In the art of swim
ming, which he regards as conducive to
good health.
"The great trouble In the education of
children," said Mr. Webster, "is that we
devote too little time to their physieaLim
provement. The very reason why chil
dren are unable to cope with their home
studies, over which there has been so
much controversy, is because they are
not physically constituted by proper and
judicious exercise to do so. Let us have
athletic instruction and they will be bet
ter fit for mental labor, for both go hand
in hand. There can be no obiectlon to
teaching sewing and some of the manual
trades in connection with other studies.
Some parents have opposed the study of
cooking in schools, but they are, in the
minority."

VII. CAROLINE HERSCTTTX.
(1750-IS4S.)
BY CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN.
In Hanover 150 years ago there was born
Into the Herschel family a little girl
named Caroline. The youngest of many
children, she soon became the household
drudge, working to maintain the well-be
ing of hrr older brothers. Jacob, the old
est of the flock, often whipped her If she
did not wait deftly upon him at table, but
William, the second brother, always pro
tected her and was her good comrade
whenever she could be spared from her
duties as Fcullerymaid.
Isaac Herschel, Caroline's father, was
bandmaster of the royal regiment of Han
over, a. musician of considerable ability,
who carefullyeducated hffe sons and would
have extended the same privilege to his
daughter had he not been so bitterly op
posed in this by his wife. Frau Herschel
adhered with 'even more than the usual
Teutonic tenacity to the theory that a girl
should have no more education than would
enable her to become a competent family
drudge who could minister to the men or
the household. In Caroline's memoirs she
speaks of knitting her first stocking so
long that as she stood up to finish it It
just touched the floor. Knitting, string
plaiting and bugle stringing were her ac-

NEW YORK, March 30.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Railroad
share values continued" their advance -.this
week while Industrials and other specialties
were Irregular and In â¢ some cases developed
considerable unsteadiness. A feature of the
week's market was the further activity of
Americans in London and large purchase by
foreigners of International shares. The buying
has been on a larger scale than any similar
demonstration on the part of . European In
terests In some years. : It is Indeed : hinted
that the movement has been worked up : from '
thlsi side, .but the amount of stocks that are
being shipped abroad . and the large volume
of the trading In Americans at London seems
to negative this Idea. The theory . which : finds
acceptance In conservative circles is that Â¦ the
foreign financial and speculative . world t ap
preciates â¢ the Importance -of the currency bill
which has put the United States firmly on a
gold basis and is also expressed, by , the present
enormous earnings .of railroads in this coun
try and 'the promise they . afford of increased
dividends or of payments on the stocks *of
EASTERN MARKETS
NEW YORK, March 30.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Progress toward better things has been un
mistakable. It was a year ago that the fren
zied speculation In Industrial stocks reached
Its culmination with, pricei averaging higher
than at any time since, while railroad stocks
after some decline rose $1 13 per share higher
In September and after the fall in both, which
ended In December, have now risen $S 35 per
share, to the highest point of this year. The
advance during the past week has been re
markably vigorous and with more public sup
port than before.
Wheat exports fall far below last year's,
amounting in the week to 9,766,891 bushels,
against 14.105,Â£. c 6 bushels, last year. The price
has advanced 2',ic with statements that the
crop of France is greatly reduced, though It
is rather early to make any euch estimate.
The exports of corn again prove the magni
tude of foreign demand for cereals, as the
extraordinary movement of last year Is closely
approached, 11,794.875 bushels having gone
abroad in four weeks, against 13,102,811 bushels
last year. The Western receipts are nearly
three times as large as In the' same week
last year. Indicating an abundant supply on
hand, but the price has -risen l%c.
â¢ Wool has declined fully lc on the average
of revised quotations and more for fleece and
fine or fine medium territory, which sells at
Â£5c clean, with medium closing at 60c. The
goods market is quiet and orders are limited
and outside the favorites prices are irregular,
with 5 per cent decline In some medium wool
ens and fine v/orsteds.
Iron is growing weaker except in Bessemer
pig, which is held at $24 90. at Plttsburg In
spite of small sales of Eastern at lower figures.
Anthracite No. 1 has sold little above $23 and
basic at $22 50. with Eastern forge offered at
$:0 50 at Pittsburg. In finished products no
further change appears except In refined bars,
which sell In large orders close to 2c at Phil
adelphia and In plates, which are selling at
2c or less at both markets. Better prices are
excepted from the consolidation In sheets. But
It will not be easy nor in the end profitable
to hold prices after supplies so far exceed
demand that material can be bought at lower
cost.
The advance of lc In sole leather has led
to some heavy transactions, though In fact
but a restoration of prices paid In January.
It restricts orders for boots and shoes, which
are small, although shipments continue about
7 per cent larger than last year for March,
exceeding those of other Â¦â¢ years still more.
Hides at Chicago continue to decline, though
slowly. Transactions through clearing-houses
show a much smaller volume of business than
a year ago, the daily average for March being
14.3 per cent smaller than last year, but 34.4
per cent larger than In IS9S.
Failures for the week have been 203 in th*
United States, against 194 last year, and 33
in Canada, against 26 last year.

Influence in checking the buying movements.
As the buying of the specialties was largely
to cover ehort contracts it was not Influenced
by money market considerations. There was
no EtlfTness in thÂ« rates for money, but pre
liminary figures of to-morrow's bank state
ment failed to indicate so strong a return as
baa been counted upon. Owing to the falling
off in the amount of Government bonds offered
for conversion the disbursement of premiums
decreased and the week's gain by the banks
from the sub-treasury will be less than a
million dollars. On the interior movement by
express the net receipts are estimated at less
than half a million. As against this small
gain In cash the expansion in loans has un
questionably been large. There is ground for
doubt, therefore, whether considerable inroad ;
has not been made on the surplus.
Business in the bond market showed a falling
off. but prices were about maintained. Total
sales, par value, $3,390,000.
United States 3s, old 4s and new 4s declined

reorganized roads which have not yet yielded
a return to their holders. There is a good
deal of manipulation in Â¦Â¦ certain parts of the
market. Poor support and activity were seen
In the Pacific and coal stocks and in other
portions of the list as well. A good deal of
profit-taking was also observed and some of
the stocks which headed the advance and Its
beginning failed to retain all their advances.
Yet the railroad list was strong In tone and
by Its readiness to rally from any reactions
demonstrated the presence of a growing pub
lic Interest in speculation. Money has grown
easier for stock market purposes and the re
lease of the funds that have been used to
carry Government bonds is proceeding a pace
as the bonds are turned Into the treasury for
conversion into new 2s. The Increase â¢In the
national bank notes Is alsj having an effect
on sentiment in advance of the appearance
of such new circulation in any great amounts.
Nor has the market been impressed to any
extent by the fact that Imports are increasing
and that this with the paying oft of foreign
loans contracted . some months ago has caused
a sharp rise In exchange on the face of large
, foreign buying of securities. The principal
unsettling influences have been in connection
with the Industrial stocks. The steel group
and others of their class were early In the
1 week the objects of tentative bullish manipu
lations, but decided improvement was checked
by the large supply of such securities by the
year of labor disturbances and by the Idea
that the trust . agitation may lead to some
adverse action as regards combinations at the
present session of Congress.

December. Most of the growers are holding
their Wools waiting for buyers to come, but the
Eastern and local markets are in such a con
dition, being quiet and dull, that buyers do not
know. what to do or what prices to pay.
"Statistically Wool ought to be stronger as
the woolen mills are more actively employed
than for years, but they,, bought such tremen
dous lots of Wool during October and Novem
ber last year that they seem to ha vo enough
raw material on hand without coming Into the
market. Wools are held firm everywhere, so if
the manufacturers have to come into the mar

CHICAGO, March 30.â Wheat opened easier
because of lower cables from Liverpool, %Â©%c
under yesterday, at 66%Â©66% c. In a short
time the price sank from that to 60% c, where
the report of damage to the French crop made
its habitual appearance and joined with re
ports of a blizzard in Austria and higher prices
In Budapest, caused a reaction . which- sent
May to 67%Jg67',jc. Profit-taking . caused a
reaction to 66>ic, but on the break shorts
covered, taking the cue from the strength of
corn and nearly all ; the slump was recovered,
the market closing strong. May %t(% t (l 1 /bc over
yesterday at 67Vi@67%c. St. Louis covered in
enormous lots and traders who had sold early
also made haste to take back their early
sales, materially aiding ' in the strength and
activity. There was a fair cash demand, but
the car scarcity â¢ interfered with the closing
of many deals. Domestic crop reports were
favorable, as was the weather. Argentine ship
ments while large were no larger than usual
of late.
The corn market was broad and strong,
helped principally by a heavy export demand.
The demand for shipment in April was also
heavy, but the ever-present difficulty in getting
cars Intruded Itself and was an efllcient check
on much business of this sort. Country offer
ings were light and cables lower. May closed
%tiVic over yesterday.
The strength of corn held oats firm. The
trade gradually showed a balance In . favor of
July options. July closed %c improved and
May He up.
Provisions were nervous with fluctuations
wide and the market altogether rather Jerky.
The opening was under yesterday, the con
sideration being lower prices at the yards. A
small dip followed and then the market re
acted. May pork shooting up 30c to $12 97%.
There was a good cash demand, but there was
also considerable profit-taking, which told in
the end, the close being rather heavy. May
pork closed oc under yesterday, May lard 6Â©
7% c down and May ribs 5c depressed.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been five arrivals of Coal from Brit
ish Columbia. 14.363 tons; four from Washing

tal. 26,763 tons. The quantity of Coal coming
to hand for the past few weeks is serving tt>
make the fuel question easy with large consum
ers, and we can once more breathe freely, as
we have tided over the winter requirements. A
few months ago it was a most serious question
as to whether our receipts would fill our urgent
requirements at that time. The bottom planks
of yards were visible that had not been uncov
ered for years, as all the Coal had been taken
out. Coast Coal carriers were unprocurable,, as
the sailers were diverted from the trade, find
ing more profit by carrying Coal and Lumber
off the coast, steamers had been drafted into
the transport service, and no foreign cargoes
were arriving. The outlook was most discour
aging for our principal consumers, as ihort
stocks usually lead to high prices, especially
when the producers number so few, but singular
to say no advantage was taken of the situation,
and I'alues have not been disturbed. It is evi
dent that for some time to come steamers will
be utilized to transport our Northern output,
hence new names are being added to the list,
and we shall shortly have the yards again ac
cumulating a reserve, which they prudently
aim to l.aye on hand."

NEW YORK, March 30.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: It has been a quiet week In dis
tributive trade, except at some few Western
centers, this being especially true of the dry
goods business. '.Wholesale trade in this line
has been generally completed and pending the
effect of spring demand upon the retail trade
the markets are In a waiting stage. As re
gards prices the feature of the week has been
the strength 'manifested by agricultural prod
ucts and provisions. The advances in the lat
ter, in fact, are regarded as foreshadowing an
upward movement in hog products, long pre
dicted, but only partially realized. Numerous
advances In wages have still further advanced
the purchasing power of the community. Dis
quieting advices as to the international compli
cations and less favorable French crop reports
have furnished the basis for a slight upward
movement in wheat. Winter wheat crop ad
vices have been on the whole good, and have
acted as a balance to the stories of French
damage. Corn has been strong in sympathy
with wheat and some renewal of foreign buy
ing, aided by unsatisfactory advices as to the
quality of new arrivals.
Alone of the agricultural staples cotton has
weakened during the week, not because of any
Impairment of the statistical position, which.
Indeed, remains very strong, but really because
some speculative holders have got tired and
have given ear to reports of dullness in the
cotton goods demand. New business In this
latter line Is undoubtedly quiet, but most of
the mills are heavily sold ahead and finished
products have not advanced proportionately as
much as the ; cruder forms. Wool has been
more active, but considerable business has
been done at concessions. The demoralization
In the sugar market is clearly confined to the
refining branch, because while quotations of
the finished products have been lowered the
heavy refiners have been large buyers and raw
sugar has actually advanced, the result being
a stull further shrinkage in the margin of
profit in reflnins.
The recent advance In leather has tended to
restrict new business, but advices from the
boot and shoe industry are on the whole fa
vorable. There has been some accumulation
of stocks of lumber and talk of overproduction
in some States of the South, but price weak
ness !s not notable. Manufacturers and Job
bers in carpets and upholstery report a heavy
season's business booked.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.963.349 bushels, against 2.293.
435 last week, 3.955.235 In the corresponding
week of 1?99, 3.550,664 In IS9S. 2.464,645 In 1597
and 1.693.J27 in 1595. Since July 1, this season,
the exports of wheat aggregate 147,172,630 bush
els, against 154,9Gi),740 last year and 150.067,552
In IÂ£9'-9S.
Business failures In the United States for the
week number 178, as compared with 192 last
week, 190 in this week a year ago, 226 In IS9S,
212 In 1897 and 226 In 1896.

THAT the civil service provision in the new charter Is far
reaching was demonstrated last nieht when an exami
% . nation for the responsible position of sewer cleaner was
held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission.
The new municipal administration is bent on applying the
civil service test to each and every employe under Its imme
diate control, and to the eyes of the uninitiated this would ap
pear to mean that political considerations in appointments have
been oast to the winds. Time will, however, very likely tell a
vÂ«*ry different taae and the truth of the biblical Injunction,
"The first shall be last and the last shall be first," will un
doubtedly be verified in selecting names from the eligible list.
Last night Commissioner McCarthy personally conducted the
examination of 130 applicants for positions as sewer cleaners.
He was assisted by Chairman Freud, who took copious notes,
and Commissioner Quinn, who did nothing but look wise. The
commission was reinforced by a board of examiners consisting
of W. F. Crotty and O. A. Tveltmore, who are experienced ce
ment workers, and W. J. McGowan, a master plumber, whose
duty it was to pass, on the physical qualifications of the ap

PAWNS DIVORCE
PAPERS TO BUY
FIERY LIQUOR
J. Barleycorn Debow's Thirst
â¢ Seriously Deranges
His Compass.
Â¦ ?
Sundry Barkeeps in Alameda Sepa-
rate Him From Much Coin and
More Jewelry and Trouble
Ensues.
ALAMEDA, March SO.â J. Barleycorn
Debow, a San Francisco attorney, to-day
accomplished the unprecedented feat of
prevailing upon a conscienceless "barkeep"
to part with one dollar's worth of fiery
liquor In exchange for a bundle of divorce
papers, which he came all the way across
the bay to file. The "soaked" papers are
an Important part Incident in the troubles
of a Berkeley family, being the complaint
in the suit for divorce of Edson versus
Edson.
The original destination of Mr. Debow
was the County Clerk's ofnee. But in his
journey across the bay he acquired a
package," and an enterprising barkeeper
on the ferryboat separated him from most
of his small change. His compass became
deranged by the time he landed at the
narrow gauge mole, and instead of going
to Oakland he found his way to Alameda.
On the streets of this quiet town he bois
terously proclaimed his intention to file
his papers with Justice of the Peace Morris.
But Justice Morris' courtroom is located
too far away from the cocktail route, and
Mr. Debow never touched him. By the
time he tore himself away from the first
hostelry on the route his small change had
become exhausted. Then he began to feel
the burden of too much jewelry, and be
fore long he had succeeded in stripping
himself of all he possessed In that line.
Including aluminum rings, electric dia
monds, celluloid cuff buttons, a nickel
plated watch and a pair of eyeglasses,
giving them in exchange for fiery liquor.
At last Mr. Debow was down to cases.
He had nothing more to part with except
a bundle of divorce documents, and still
his thirst was unquenched. He adopted
persuasive measures. Would the barkeep
er advance him the drinks on the legal
papers? He pleaded with all the eloquence
at his command. His pathetic words did
not fall upon deaf ears, and soon his sad
story of an unsatiated thirst won him the
day. The "barkeep" took the proffered
papers and handed out liquor to the
amount of $1. After that Mr. Debow be
came obnoxious, and soon he came to
grief by running Into the arms of a minion
of the law.
Now Mr. Debow unwillingly languishes
in the City Jail, while the precious docu
ments which were destined to part a war
ring couple are securely locked In the
trunk of a conscienceless "barkeep." And
until Mr. Debow digs up the sum of $1 and
takes the goods out of "soak" a warring
couple in Berkeley will continue to war.

Official Grade of Sixth Street.
A committee of property owners visited
the Board of Public Works yesterday to
request the co-operation of that body
with the Board of Supervisors in fixing a
uniform grade on Sixth street, between
Folsom and Bryant. The committee re
ferred to the deplorable condition of tho
street and made an urgent plea for relief
Supervisor Maguire Informed the com
mittee that the City Attorney had ren
dered an opinion that the only legal grade
was the one adopted In 1806. City En
gineer Grunsky stated that the street car
company had built its tracks on that
grade. ,
The only remedy lies In thÂ« raising of
tho houses to conform to the grade as
established In 18C6. The city will no doubt
perform the necessary street work, . but
the board held that on account of.lnsuf
ficient funds It could not be done at pres
ent.
by the Bakars. She was in the kitchen
preparing breakfast, Bakar and Miclo
having gone to the shop. Suddenly a
cloud of smoke burst upon the girl, who
ran into a hallway, only to be driven back
by the thick, black mass. Mrs. Bakar was
In another room, and the two women gave
the alarm of fire, which attracted the men
next door. .MJclo was first to the house.
"Save the children," cried the, women.
Without hesitating ' the young man
rushed through the house to the chlldrens*
bedroom and burst open the door. The
suffocating clouds of. smoke drove him
back. A second time he presspd in, driven
to -desperation by the crackling flames,
and this time he succeeded In reaching the
bedside in which slept the two boys. '
The fire threatened to destroy. the house,
but the place was saved by prompt work
of the firemen. What caused the blaze
could not be; explained by the- family.
The fire started near the bed, as the con
dition of Â¦Â¦ the burned; mattress" indicated.'
It is supposed that a lighted candle used
by one of the children had tipped over and
had started a smoldering fire in the bed
clothing; which did not break out seriously
until, hours after it caught.
v> Max. Bakar s is' nine i years old and' his
brother is only three years of age. Their
rescuer was ? uninjured; save for V some
slight choking from the smoke he Inhaled.
OAKLAND, March 80.â Unconscious
from smoko suffocation and In deadly
peril of being burnedto death, Max
Bakar and George Bakar, young
children of Peter : Bakar, ' were dragged
from a blazing bed at their home, 317
Fifth street, this morning. That the lit
tle fellows were not cremated was the re
sult of daring work on the part of Joseph
Mlclo, a young butcher employed by
Bakar In his shop adjoining the residence.
Through flame and smoke which. almost
overpowered him the youth fought - his
way to the sleeping children and dragged
both of them to a place of Bafety.V
The little fellows were nearly dead when
rescued. -and only after several hours of
hard work did the physicians who : were
called manage to resuscitate them.
The boys were found in the nick of time.
When young Miclo broke Into the blazing
chamber the lads' bed . was â¢ hidden :In
blinding smoke , arid the mattress was
smoldering In slow fire, which broke into
flames just as the young man had dragged
the boys' out. He was obliged to drop on
the floor to save himself and literally haul
the limp forms of the children out of the
densely clouded- room. v i**-- ,- v , Â¦> â¢
The fire was discovered about 6 o'clock
by Maggie Madden, a domestic employed
Assaulted With a Hatchet.
Frank Navarro, an ex-Jockey, struck

Died in the Patrol Wagon.
George Hartwell, a carpenter, while at
work on a building -at View avenue and
Elizabeth street fell from a scaffolding
yesterday and received injuries which
caused his death while on the way to the
City and County Hospital In the patrol
wagon from the Seventeenth-street sta
tion. Hartwell's misfortunes date back
Just one month ago, when, while at work
on his house at. 436 Athens street, which
he had finished, was burned down. At the
time of tho destruction of this house his
vest, which was hanging on a nail and
contained $114 and a gold watch and

CHARTER DID NOT ALTER
SCHOOL BOARD STATUS
By sustaining a demurrer Judge Sea well
yesterday practically granted the Board
of Education the right to proceed and try
the charges against E. C. Kilpatrick,
principal of the Business Evening School.
Kilpatrick Bued to restrain the board from
hearing the charges against him on the
ground that they were preferred during
the term In office of the last board, and
that the new board was not a continuance
of the old one, as the charter governs the
present body. Judge Seawell held a con
trary opinion, and hence sustained a de
murrer interposed by City and County
Attorney Lane to Kilpatrick's petition for
a writ of prohibition.

GRAVE CHARGES AGAINST
PALO ALTO OFFICIALS
Accused of Being Parties to the Bold
Abduction of a Chinese
Girl.
Special IMspatch to The Call. .':?_' :., V.
PALO ALTO, March 30.â The quiet town
of Palo Alto Is thoroughly aroused and
Indignant over what seems thÂ© complicity
of some of her prominent citizens In an
infamous Chinese abduction case. The
fact that the whole proceedings were
planned and executed under cover of
darkness lends a distinct color of truth
to substantiate their suspicions. As mat
ters stand Justice of the Peace E. G.
Dyer and Night Watchman Dunsmore of
Palo Alto and Deputy Constable' Harris
of San Jose are accused of the most gross
maltreatment of Justice.
The facts appear as follows: On the
27th lnst. a warrant charging one Kirn
Guey with petty larceny was issued in
Palo Alto by Justice Dyer. This warrant
was put In the hands of a San Jose dep
uty for service. , Â¦
According to the statement made by
Miss Cameron the girl, who Is known to
her 'as Kum Foong, was arrested at the
mission in San Francisco and taken to
Palo Alto. She accompanied the girl to
the prison, but early in the morning Kum
Foong was taken from her. Miss Cam
eron was afterward Informed that the
Chinese girl was haled Into court at 2
o'clock in the morning, pleaded guilty,
was fined $5 and was taken away by
some Chinese, presumably to be returned
to the life from which she was rescued.
Judge Dyer says he did not consider
the holding of the court at such an hour
an Irregular proceeding, and was unaware
of the fact that Miss Cameron was not
informed of the trial. Palo Alto citizens
do not consider the matter so lightly,
and will probe the affair to the bottom.
It appears that a tlmilar case came up
In Palo Alto, about a year ago, when
practically the same parties were Impli
cated.

COATS REFUSED TO
MARRY MISS SCOTT
Young Man Detained by Tacoma Po
lice, but Released in the Ab
sence of a Warrant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 30.â Pretty 16-year-old
Rosa Scott of San Francisco met Lee D.
Coats of Fresno last January and loved
him not wisely but too well. To-day Coats
was arrested by the Tacoma police and
detained half an hour, while Rosa and
her father begged him to marry her. An
offer of a good home in San Francisco
and a monthly income of $100 failed to
move him. A warrant for his arrest was
Issued several days ago at Portland. It
having failed to arrive the police did not
hold Coats and he was released. Scott
and his daughter left to-night for Seattle,
whence they will return to San Francisco.
The girl's father is W. E. Stowe Scott,
proprietor of the Lawrenceton Hotel in
San Francisco. He came north In Jan
uary, accompanied by his daughter. At
Sacramento Coats boarded the train and
he and Rosa became lovers. When Mr.
Scott learned of his daughter's relations
with Coats he went to Fresno, where
Coats' father Is the owner of the Fresno
Flouring Mills. Receiving little satisfac
tion there, Scott and daughter started out
on young Coats' trail, iinally catching him
here to-day.
At the police station Rosa told Coats she
still loved him. His reply was that he
had no intention of marrying her. Scott
tried to impress upon him the wrong he
had done his daughter and made two dis
tinct propositions of marriage. The first
was that if Coats would marry her, Scott
would fit them up in a good home In San
Francisco, furnishing it with a piano and
other accessories and give them $100 a
month to live upon. His second offer was
to pay the expenses of a divorce at the
end of a few months, if Coats would be
come her husband. Coats declined to dis
cuss the matter and called in an attorney,
who accompanied him away from jail.

"War alarms fill the navy headquarters
here. The whole Euxine squadron Is fully
equipped for instant service. Troops with
full war kits are daily arriving from the
Interior. The garrison will soon be a

'â¢â¢i hero is much excitement among the

The Times has the following from Seoul,
capital of Korea:
"M. Pavloft, the Russian Minister, re
cently demanded from Korea the cession
oi a coaling station to a Russian steam
ship company at AiÂ«.inson Point, com
manding Masampho harbor, and, to pre
vent a counter claim by Japan of the
neighboring area, he demanded that
Korea should not alienate in any form any
portion of Kojedo Island to any other
power.
"Yesterday, at an imperial audience, for
reasons not given, but surmised, M. Pav
loff modlned his orierinal demand, asking
instead of Atkinson Point another site
within the treaty limits of Masampho.
This demand is unobjectionable. At the
same time, however, he insisted .on the
non-alienation of Kojedo. His action In
dicates that Russia claims the reversion
of this Island, which Is of high strategical
value, as commanding the Korean straits,
and it Is bound to provoke Japanese op
position."

James A. Scott had; proposed to the rela

The money appropriated by th<Â» Leirislature

WOMEN STAND THE TEST
BETTER THAN THE MEN
Result of Civil Service Examination
for Copyists Announced by
the Commission.
The Municipal Civil Service Commission
yesterday announced the names of those
; who passed the recent examination for
: copyists under the city government, and
the interesting fact is disclosed that the
women who competed stood the test bet
ter than the men. Out of 460 competitors
only 1M were successful, of which 102 are
women and 79 men. Out of the 36 highest
23 belong to the fair and 19 to the sterner
sex. The failure of the other 279 is at
tributed to defective handwriting. Any
one who did not get 75 per cent in that
branch was eliminated from the list.
The fact that so many women are now
on the eligible list revives the announced
Intention of Recorder Godchaux that he
will have no female copyists in his office.
He says that he will avoid that possibility
by making a requisition for twenty male
copyists, to which he is entitled. As the
law holds that each selection must be
made from the highest three the commis
sion will hold a special meeting to con
sider the matter.
The first requisition under the new order
of things was made yesterday afternoon
by County Clerk Deana. who asked for
onÂ« <?opyii<t. Secretary Moran according
ly tent 'him the names of the first three
on the *-ligible list, from whom he will
select one for the position.
The list, in which the figures represent
the standing of the contestant, is as fol

STRICKERT SUED FOR
BREACH OF PROMISE
Martha Rachpauer Alleges That He
Deceived Her and She Is
Seeking Redress.
For his alleged ardent but fickle wooing
of Miss Martha Rachpauer, Paul Strick
ert of the Cereghino-Strickert Manufac
turing Company must defend himself
against a $25,000 breach of promise suit.
Miss Rachpauer, who is 19 years of age,
alleges that she came to this city from
her home in Germany three years ago,
believing herself to be the affianced wife
of the defendant. On her arrival here she
met Stricken, and on his statement that
no regular ceremony was required under
the laws of this State and that a mere
agreement to live as husband and wife
was sufficient she assumed that relation
to him. She further alleges that she
could not speak English, knew nothing
of the laws of the country, and having
implicit faith in Stricken lived with him
up to six months ago, when she discov
ered that he had deceived her. She then
implored him to marry her and this he
promised to do at the beginning of the
new year. January passed, however, and
he failed to keep his agreement and she
left him. Since that time she says she
has lived on a small sum realized through
the sale of her personal effects.
When Â¦ she was residing with Strickert
at 1383 Stevenson street she claims that
she was always introduced by him. to his
friends as Mrs. Strickert. and in all of his
communications to her he addressed her
as his wife. In conclusion, the plaintiff
says that she has always been ready to
marry the man who deceived her, but he
persistently refused to do so, and thus
forced her to seek redress by an action
at law.
TOOK NO ACTION IN
THE FAIR LITIGATION
Grand Jury Devotes an Afternoon to
Deliberation and Examination
of Judge Denson.
The Grand Jury is not yet ready to take
final action, in the Fair-Craven controver
sy. Previous to taking up the case the
Jury went to Judge Bahrs' courtroom and
filed an indictment against David Davis
for a burglary committed at the residence
of Mrs. P. Krbe, 246. Sixth street, on the
31st of December of last year.
Judge Denson, one of Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven-Fair's attorneys, was the only
witness examined in the Fair-Craven case.
He testified that Mrs. Craven-Fair had
told him as early as in August, 1896, in
the presence of Mrs. Margaret Koehler,
her daughter, that she was married to
Fair, had a contract of marriage and that
there was a celebration of the nuptials.
It was understood before the jury con
vened that it would definitely decide
whether indictments should be issued for
the arrest of various witnesses in the
case, but it was eventually decided to
postpone action until next Friday.
Many Applicants Were Desirous of Serving the City by Cleansing Its Sewers of All Refuse.
lieemen were on hand to preserve order, and each man was ad
mitted in the examination room In the commission's office on
presentation of a card which was numbered by Clerk Maher,
a duplicate number being registered by the stenographer In his
notebook. When the applicant was brought before the Inquisi
torial body Commissioner McCarthy put the following ques
tions, which in all cases were the same, and all answers 'were
duly recorded:
"What is your age?" "Have you ever done sewer work,
and for what length of time?" "What preparations would you
make in order to protect the city and your own life before en
tering a sewer 7" "If you had to alter the course of the water
what would you do?" "At what point would you enter a sewer
built on an Incline?"
To all the questions most of the applicants gave intelligent
answers, though quite a number slipped, up on the last. Â¦ The
right answer, which was confided to the reporters by a mys
terious whisper by Commissioner McCarthy, is, "At the lower
end, because the poisonous gases which rise to the upper part
are dangerous." Some thought it was proper to enter at the
upper end because it was easier to work down hill.
The main question, however, which was not asked last night,
but which will be when the proper time comes, is: "Will you
stand in with the 'main squeeze of the "reform 1 government,
and how do you stand with him now?" :â¢Â¦Â¦> ->Â¦ â¢.>-â¢.

Oakland Offlr.Â» San Francisco Call,
1118 J'roadway. March 30.
A most peculiar accident which will cost
12-3 rear-old Eugene Kraft his life occurred
~t Mission San Jose yesterday afternoon,
ilje boy used a cartridge for a target,
â¢which was exjÂ»loded jy a shot from his
22-cal:ber ri2e, the bullet entering Ilia
iit-ad 'ust above the t* mplÂ«?. That he was
not ii.stamly killtd 1* considered almost
as mi:arulous as was me manner in which
be wj.s wounded.
The boy had been f. it hunting: during
the n. Â¦â¢ruing with his parlor rifle, but the
iiirds .vere scarce, and is hÂ«* was return
ing h nnÂ«- he oommo; cc.l shooting ay
mark:- alonjf th<? route Finally, to -test
r.is mrltsmansbip. he locked for pome
raal! abject at wnirh t.. shoot. He tried
H-bltl.s and clods, but they were unsatis
factory, and iinally. in looking for more
mr.mu lition. he found a larpre SprinKlield
< ariri< se i" bis pocket. The thought
-truck Him that hor<- was in excellent tar
a*i. it was tirst .necessary, however, to
lind a place t<> set tli<* der.-iiy missile, and
tnis !v> at-cotnplished with considerable
difficulty. It appeared :k if late were
trying :o save him from hi- foolhardiness,
hut he at last found a lo '.King place for
the bul el in the forks of a me. I'nfortu
rat-ly M placed it where the shell rested
firmly ..gainst a limb, wit!: the bullet to
ward' lini. Then he walked ff a few paces
;;nd wf.h no thought of she danger to
himself commenced flritg at the ear
trtdse. Again did it seem triat some un
(Â¦f-n power was trying to shield the reck
less yot.th, for although he was an excel
lent sh. t it was not till he had fired six
lime* t) ;i' he hit the murk.
The cirirMge was so firmly placed in
the forl--: of the tree thar when it explod
t-Â«1 the ball went straight to the lad"s
!:e:id ar'3 he fell to the ground uncon
rCi'.US.
The boy's father. Oeorge Kraft, princl
jal of :he school at Mission San Jose,
found h.s son lying in the road a few
minntes later and removed him to his
Scime. where medical aid was summoned.
The physicians, however, were unable to
3o much for the unfortunate child, and he
s not expected to live.

THE THORNTON
STAKE WILL BE
DECIDED TO-DAY
Six Four-Milers to Start for
'the Rich Prize at Oak
land Track.
More Outsiders in Front Yesterday.
Corolla Downs a Field at 40
to Iâ Vesuvian First in
the Handicap.
' â 'Â¦ â -â¢â
It Is only once a year that patrons of
the turf have the pleasure of witnessing
a four-mile contest, and no doubt the his
toric Thornton stake down for decision at
Oakland this afternoon will draw the
same vast throng of people as In past
seasons. The big event has been won in
the past by The Bachelor, Schiller, Judge
Denny, Star Ruby and Gllead. all tried
and sturdy performers. Schiller was
owned by Barney Schrelber, and beyond
peradventure of a doubt the St. Louis
bookmaker's entry. Forte, will be favor
ite for. to-day's race. The bay horse is a
stayer and handles weight well. Weller,
trained by Marley Klttleman, the once
well-known foot racer, has received a
special "prep." for the affair, and may
bag the game, for he also fancies a route.
The stable think well of Ledaea, and if
rated Potente might upset things. Twink
ler is by no means out of it, and with
such a nicely balanced lot of starters a
splendid race is looked forward to.
The sport at Oakland yesterday . fur
nished * another batch of long-shot win
ners, the only successful choices being
Montanus and Vesuvian.
The longest priced one to get over the
plate was Corolla, from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, which captured the
opening number at 40 to L" Jim Morgan
piloted the filly, and in a hard drive led
the favorite Gusto out a head.
Mortgage, the 7 to 5 choice for the mlle
and-a-sixteenth run, next met defeat by
Donator. Johnny Ranch had the mount
on the latter horse, and catching the fav
orite below the paddock, beat him out a
head. Seven to one was laid against the
winner.
Ab Stemler's filly Illusion closed a luke
warm choice for the two-yeaa-old scram
ble, and her chances were ruined by the
start. Chaste, with Ross up, won easily
from Carilee.
After betting on the seven-and-one
half-furlong affair had progressed some
minutes the report gained credence that
Montanus was lame, causing the horse's
odds to go from 6 to 5 to 2. The price
against Monda was then rapidly cut from
4& to 11 to 6. The rumor did not hold
good, for after Monda had led until with
in less than a furlong from home Mon
tanus headed and beat him without diffi
culty. Rosalbra was third.
The even-money choice, Vesuvian, won
the seven-furlong handicap from start to
finish. Simply galloping, the colt led The
Fretter past the wire, with his mouth
wide open, in 1:26%. Rosormonde, which
seems to have gone back woefully, ran
third, never displaying much speed.
Johnny Woods, at last showed a spark
of his old form on the. back of Jennie
Reid in the closing mile run. He rode a
nice race out in front of his field, winning
at the end in a drive from Lothian, the
favorite.

so easy just to run out of the warm

to take cold in doing so. Then perhaps
comes suppression and kindred evils.

Favorite Prescription may lie relied upon
to re-establish perfect health. It is
strictly a temperance medicine, contain-

â¢"Several years ag^> I suffered severely froa
female vrearaess, prolapsus and menorrhagia,
and used * Favorite Prescription Â» with splendid
effect," writes Fannie Shelton, of Washington,
lowa. "Glad I have not needed it for a few
years part but If I should have a return of the
old trouble would surely try ' Favorite Prescrip-
tion.' I have recommended it to a number of
my lady friends. I always tell them to try a
bottle and if they are not benefited by it I will
pey for the medicine. In every case they have
spoken in prai-c of it."

sropriate resolutions will be adopted con-
Jemning those who were responsible for
thÂ« outrage and telegrams will be for
warded to all the commercial centers of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 31, 1900.
BRITONS SHOW
ENTHUSIASM AT
A BIG BENEFIT
Concert .at Metropolitan
Temple for Relief of
the Soldier.
Dr. Frederick W. D'Evelyn, William
Greer Harrison and Others Make
Speeches That Arouse the
Audience.
i The British residents of San Francisco
packed Metropolitan Temple last night In
aid* of the London Mansion House fund
for the relief of the families of British
soldiers killed In - the Boer-British war.
The entertainment, called on the pro
gramme "a concert," was of a varied na
ture, consisting of enthusiastic addresses,
somo excellent musical numbers and
Scottish national dances.
Tommy Atkins and his heroic work at
the front was the theme of the speeches.
William Greer Harrison presided and his
introductions of the speakers of the even
ing received the same hearty welcoming
vociferations as the eloquent efforts of
the chosen orators, i
Whenever the English soldier was men
tioned, general or private, cheer after
cheer rent the air, holding the speakers
on the platform midway in their ad
dresses. Treating the Boers, sometimes
with ridicule, sometimes with a deep feel
ing of respect, the speakers were applaud
ed or hissed as the subject-matter ex
alted the English soldier or passed with
lukewarm mention of the Boers' part in
the war.
After the playing of the Highland pipes
by I. S. R. Tevendale, Donald Weir and
Adam Ross and the singing of the na
tional anthem, "America," by Miss Grace
1.. Davis, William Greer Harrison, chair
man of the evening, delivered a stirring
address. In part he said:
God save the Queen, that, ladles and gentle
men, is my speech. Should I speak for an
hour I could say nothing that would appeal to
you so fully and so truly, but as your chair
man for to-night I must appear before you a
number of times, and I .want to, be quite at
home with you a:id feel that whatever I say
Is In the ' interest of the best that Is in this
feathering. The meeting to-night Is one of
charity and love and fellowship. We all know
who Tommy Atkins Is; we all know of his life
and what he has done for his country, and
here In this far-distant land, thousands and
thousands of miles away, we have decided that
thore he left behind, whether wife, | children,
mother or Bitters, shall suffer Just as little aa
possible. Tommy is making no appeal to the
world.- He is doing- his duty. But those who
admire and like him are not going to be silent
because Tommy is. Tommy Is behind his guns
â that Is his place. Tommy is doing his work
very steadily. I want to tell you that I have
just left a large asesmblafse of American gen
tlemen, all of high standing, and I have not
found one amonc them whose heart was not
in to-night's meeting. I notice on the pro
gramme that Irish songs. Scotch ballads and
Welsh tongs are to be sung, but they are no
longer to be called by such titles, because they
are all British songs.
Miss Alma Berglund followed and
sweetly sang "Robin Adair" and- "Coming
Thro 1 the Rye." Professor Henry Holmes,
leader of the Symphony orchestra, was
accorded a warm reception and played
several violin solos. Duncan Mackintosh,
Adam and -Byron Ross and Miss Sybil
Campbell, attired in costume, danced a
Highland reel that brought down the
house. Attorney F. D. Brandon followed
with a short address. In part he said:
Mr. Chairman and Ladles and Gentlemen:
Some seven or eight weeks ago I, In common
with a number of former British subjects, de
sired to have a meeting which should to some
extent offset the pro-Boer meetings which had
already been held. The time seemed to be the
very worst for the British army. Disaster fol
lowed disaster. Almost every day brought
news of some British defeat or repulse, and It
seemed to those of us who spoke together on
the subject that It was fitting that we should
stand by in the blackest hour that England
had seen for a great many years past and de
clare ourselves In favor of the old land
Before arrangements could be made the tide
turned. Lord Roberts â â¢
The speaker could proceed no further
for at least five minutes. Cheer after
cheer rang through the hall for "Bobs"
and for Kitchener and White. When the
enthusiasm had subsided he continued: *
Roberts, followed by the soldiers who loved
him, had once more caused victory to perch
on the British banners. Then we felt that the
meeting that had been projected was unneces
sary. The time had gone by. and we thought
It was not well to hold what seemed to be an
entirely pro-British meeting to offset the pro-
Boer meetings. But we said there was Tommy
Atkins to be provided for. J
The speaker. then concluded his speech
with an account of- the doings In the
Transvaal. . The mention of Kruger"s
name aroused a storm of hoots and hisses
that completely drowned the speaker's
statement about the venerable Boer
leader. ! -Â¦â¢Â¦""v.
J. F. Fleming sang the "Soldiers of the
Queen" with force and feeling. The rol
licking song scored a great hit with the
audience and many, voices Joined in the
singing of the chorus. N. F. Taggart of
the Seaforth' Highlanders, dressed in his
natty uniform of red and armed with his
rifle, marched on the stage and went
through the evolutions of the British
soldier. The sight of a real live "Tommy
Atkins" was the signal for wild en
thusiasm.
Dr. Frederick W. d'Evelyn was next In
troduced, and the hero of the first upris
ing in the Transvaal was accorded an ova
tion. For over half an hour the doctor
entertained his auditors with descriptions
and "camp, sketches" that were full of
?athos and replete with stirring incident,
le took umbrage at David Starr Jordan,
president of Stanford University, because
that gentleman accused the English sol
dier of being a bully, and he paid his re
spects to General Cronje, for whom he has
very little regard. He told of the cruelty
and the treachery of the Boers, and hl3
.word painting drew laughter and -tears
from his audience. â¢ Speaking of his expe
rience in a besieged fort he said in part;
On the ninety-fifth day of the Investment the
103 survlvorÃ of the 220 men who took refuge
there left the little fort, their bugles playing
"Hearts of Oak" and old Has flylnc overhead.
(Applause.) r . .....
Guess I their indlcnation when they learned
that an armistice which terminated In peace,
had been declared two weeks previously, but
news had been suppressed by Cronje, the ideal
of the American newspapers. Â¦
That, Indies and gentlemen, waÂ» not the act
of a man; it was not the act of a soldier, but
the treachery of a Cronje. That act, combined
with many others; won for him the title of the.
. "Nana Sahib" I of; the Transvaal, and If there
is a divinity that ' shapes our ends, shapes the
ends of Boer and Briton, rough as they all are.
methlnks there was a fitting dispensation In the
fact that the "Nana Sahib" of the Transvaal
should needs surrender to "Indian Bobs of
Kandahar."
Mrs. J. E." Birmingham then rendered
Kipling's "Absent-minded Beggar," and
at the conclusion of the - singing Â¦of the
noble poem a collection was taken, which
added to the fund to be devoted to the
care of Tommy Atkins' relatives. Rev. A.
T. Needham delivered an address; H. M.
Fortescue rendered a vocal solo; Miriam
Sydney Smith did a sailor's hornpipe;
Miss Sybil Campbell did a sword dance,
and. the -.entertainment concluded with
the singing of "God Save the. Queen" by
the entire audience, led by Mrs. Eva Ten

COINER BRADLEY
CAPTURED AFTER
A FIERCE FIGHT
Unsuccessful Attempt to Kill
Secret Service Agent
Hazen.
A. Counterfeiter Who Made Money
Out of Mexican Dollars and
Doubled His Capital Upon
the Proceeds.
A desperate battle with a counterfeiter
was fought yesterday morning at 6
o'clock, and had not the secret service
officers taken the criminal by surprise and
covered him with the muzzles of their
revolvers he would have killed one or both
of his captors.
The mm\ was Robert Bradley, alias Bar
clay, and he claimed to have come from
Aior.tar:;i. The oCicers who made such a
clever and caring capture were United
States Secret Set vice Agent ilazen and
his assistant. Operator Cror.in.
Bradley came to tnis city about four
months ago and lived at duferent hotels,
among otnere the Westminster and the
iirookiyn. He is a striking looking man
about 45 years old. of the cowooy type,
with iron-gray hair and mustache, ana
wears a somorero. After he had been
here about a month Agent Hazen began
to suspect him of coining. Mis mode, of
living, the places frequented by him and
the tact that he did not appear to have
axy business or other means of liveli
hood, strengthened these suspicions. The
suspect was at once plaerd under espion
age, and at the end of three months the
officers had secured sufficient evidence to
warrant his "arrest for counterfeiting
T'rtfted States dollars. These coins -were
the most dangerous counterfeits that could
be put upon the market. Bradley simply
melted a Mexican dollar, value 45 or 50
cents, made it Into an American dollar and
cleared 50 cents by the operation. The
coins turned out by him were perfect and
could be passed upon the banks with as
much ease as they could be passed upon
small tradesmen.
At 6 o'clock yesterday morning Agent
Hazen and Operator Cronin visited Brad
ley's room, 622 Clay street, and caught him
as he was coming out of the door. As
soon as he ?.iw the detectives his right
hand went to his hip pocket, but the muz
zles of two revolvers were thrust Into his
face and he was sternly commanded not
to attempt to move his hand under pain
of having his brains blown out. At the
same moment Cronin- threw himself upon
the counterfeiter and wrested the revolver
from his grasp. Then the desperate crim
inal fought and attempted to bite his cap
tors, but they had him down upon the
floor in a twinkling and the handcuffs
were forced upon his wrists.
In his room were found molds, steel dies
of the most scientific make and other
paraphernalia for making money, to
gether with a quantity of Mexican dollars
and $600 in currency. Bradley said that
he came from Montana after having sold
his interest in pome silver mines. It is
expected that h^ will plead guilty, as he>
confessed after his arrest that he ha.l
been engaged in counterfeiting for a long
time.

COLLINS' SECOND WRIT
IS READY FOR HEARING
Alleged Seattle Bank-Bobber and His
Guardians Appear Before Judge
Lawlor.
Robert Collins, whose sensational arrest
on a charge of bank robbery preferred
against him In Seattle and subsequent es
cape on a writ of habeas corpus have kept
the police busy during the past .few days,
appeared before Judge I^awlor yesterday
shortly after the arrival of the Sacra
mento train that a second writ of habeas
corpus sworn out on his behalf might bt
argued. With him were Deputy' Sheriff
McLeod and a Pinkerton detective, who
are charger with the crime of kidnaping.
Attorney George D. Collins, who repre
sented the prisoner, asked that the pris
oner be remanded to Sheriff- Lackmann's
charge until the writ be heard. Judge
Lawlor granted the motion and pet the
case for hearing this morning. Deputy
Sheriff McLeod and the detective were
released on their own recognizance. Al
though Attorney Collins says that the
charge against them will- be pressed to a
final conclusion they are not worried, but
are still scheming as to the best way to
avoid other writs and get their prisoner
out of the State..
HEWS FROM HOME
CARRIED ACROSS
SNOWS AND ICE
Rich Gold Deposits Found
Under Tundra, Or
Swamps.
Gold Mine in a Well â Stampedes for
New Camps â Many Parties Al
ready Inward Bound
Prom Dawson.
R. R. McÃae and T. H. Naff el, special
messengers for J. S. Kimball & Company,
arrived in town Thursday night with
mail and papers for their employers
from Nome. They came out over the ice
by way of Dawson and Skaguay, leaving
Nome on January 6 and arriving at Seat
tle last Monday. The last news from
Nome,' prior to their arrival, was only up
to December 6. so that they have much of
interest to relate.
Their reports from the great beach min
ing camp are even more flattering than
before. Prospects have been made on
the tundra, or swamp land, 400 feet back
from the beach, with the best results.
One prospector went down twenty-three
feet and found very rich sand. One pan
yielded $13, and another $8. A second hole
sunk twelve feet yielded payÂ«dirt. A well
has been sunk under Kimball & Co.'s
warehouse, and enough fresh water se
cured to fiupDly the whole town. The
sand taken from the well was so rich
that it has all been saved and washed.
The temptation Is strong to undermine
the whole building. Kimball & Co. Have
fifty dog teams, at work, night and day,
hauling sand from the beach to the ware
house, where it is worked out.- Three
shifts of men are working.' and their pay
Is $7 50 per day and board. A nugget
worth J37 was picked ud â¢on the beach
during December, lying exposed on the
sand.
The health cf the camp has been excel
lent this winter. With the cold weather
all sickness disappeared..' During Decem
ber there were several stampedes Â¦â¢ for
new diggings, but as far as could .be
learned no district better than or even
as good as Nome was unearthed. Every
body in the camp is getting ready for big
doings as soon as the thaw comes.
Soon after" leaving Nome McÃae and
Nagel met parties of three and, four bound
in from Dawson: As they approached
Dawson these parties increased in num
ber and size, so that the rush from the
Klondike metropolis has already com
menced. It i was estimated in Dawson
that 4000 people from that place will have
arrived at Nome before the -first vessel
from San Francisco reaches there.
McÃae and Nagel traveled 1100 miles
over the ice and snow with dog teams and
alone. They left their dogs -in Seattle.
Another messenger, of the same company
left Nome the day Â¦ before, they did. com
ing by a different route., but he has' not
yet arrived. The young men will return
to Nome on the first steamer that goes in.
Ing and spoke instead on the life work of
the recently deceased Rabbi Isaac Wise,
who died last week in Cincinnati. Rabbi
Voorsanger had known Rabbi "Wise and
much of what he said was drawn from
personal observation. He spoke of the un
tiring energy- of the deceased rabbi, of his
early life and of his education. He was,
he said, a man who never took a vacation
and who was at work up almost to the
day before he died. It would be hard to
fill the vacancy he left, the speaker said,
but upon the structure Rabbi Wise had
reared he hor>ed some one would build,
using the work of the deceased that it
might serve to strengthen the work of the
future. Tho lecture was the last of Rabbi
Voorsanger's winter series.
HALF OF THE CRAVEN
FAIR CASE IS ENDED
Petitioners Close Their Cause and
the Defense Will Begin Monday
With Direct Evidence.
Out of i deep slumber the attorneys on
both sides of the Fair case roused them
selves yesterday afternoon and renewed
the legal battle which- has been waged
during the last six weeks before Judge
Troutt. A threat from the defense that
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven-Fair would not
present herself for cross-examination, per
agreement, was the reason of the hasty
session. That laay did appear, was put
upon the stand and subjected to Plerson's
cross-examination for a full hour. Then
the court adjourned till Monday at 11 a.
m., when the defense will begin ils case.
Pierson led her through the meshes of
deeds, receptions at the California Hotel,
interviews with Fair at several places,
conversation with various people and a
general excursion over, the entire case.
She was not flustered and proved once
again her; ability to withstand â¢ a heavy
cross-fire of questions..
The first play of the. day was the pre
sentation of the Dunand contract. Mrs.
Craven-Fair " acknowledged that It was
her signature attached to the. paper, but
she declared that when she signed the
document she had not read it herself. Du
nand, according to her testimony, evi
dently erred in its reading, substituting
$25,000 for $30,000, which figures the con
tract shows.
The two deeds, for the Pine street and
Mission-street properties, were then ex
hibited. The witness testified that Bhe
first saw them at her home, 2007 Califor
nia street, in the presence of Mrs. Has
kln. . This was on September 24, ISD4. The
Senator's visits were gone over again,
Mrs. Craven-Fair telling about individ
ual meetings and i conversations that
transpired. Before recordation she said
she exhibited them to Mrs.; Johnson. Mrs.
Purcell, her own daughter, Mrs. Cullen,
Mr. Bonner and John R. Altken.
Much of the old testimony was thrashed
over, especially meetings .with the Sena
tor in the latter part of May or June,
1592, one of which was the one when Bry
ant,. the "hobo", witness, was present.
Mrs. Craven-Fair told her story without
discrepancy and was finally dismissed by
the Fair heir's attorneys: â¢ '
: This 'ended the Â¦petitioner's, case. The
defense will begin its caste on Monday. :

MASTER BUILDERS
TO ACT TOGETHER
Bosses Organize to Resist the De
mands of the Carpenters'
United Brotherhood.
A meeting of master builders was held
la=t night at 33S Bush street and they per
fected a temporary organization. Sixty
three members signed the roll and pledged
themselves to resist certain rules made by
the district council of the United Brother
hood of Carpenters of San Francisco.
Th<Â» association will be known as the
"Master Builders' Association." and its
principal object will be to oppose the rules
of the Brotherhood of Carpenters, in
which It Is made compulsory on all con
tractors to employ no non-union men as
foremen on any work, and fixing $3 50 a
3ay as the minimum waces to be paid.

PASSENGERS ON
THE SANTA ROSA
IN TOUGH LUCK
Steamer Breaks Down When
a Mile Outside the
Golden Gate.
Curacao Was Quarantined at Mexican
Forts Owing to the Plague Scare.
Simpson Builds "Just One
More" Vessel.: . -
The Bteamer Santa Hosa, after an
overhauling that lasted nearly three
months, sailed for southern ports yester
day. Soon after passing out through the
heads something went wrong with her
machinery and she was compelled to an
chor a mile southwest of the Cliff House.
Soon afterward the fog settled down over
the ocean, and the Santa Rosa was not
seen again until about 4 p. m. She was
still at anchor and alongside was the
steamer Gipsy, while hove too a quarter
of a mile away was the Coos Bay. The
latter was bound in from San Diego and
way ports, while the Gipsy was outward
bound for Monterey and Santa Cruz.
The Gipsy left here about 3 p. m. yes
terday and soon after setting, his course
the captain ran across the Santa Rosa at
anchor. Captain Alexander explained that
there was a slight defect in the machin
ery, which would be rectified in a short
time and that the steamer would then pro
ceed to Port Harford. The Gipsy re
mained in attendance and soon afterward
the Coos Bay came along, and Captain
Shaw also hove to in order to find out if
assistance was required. Both the Gipsy
and Coos Bay found that ,no assistance
was required and proceeded on their way.
The steamer Curacao arrived from Mex
ican ports yesterday about twenty-four
hours behind lime. Owing to thÂ» absurd
reports of plague in Chinatown sent
broadcast over the world the vessel was
quarantined in every port she went to, and
in consequence a loss of fully $4000 has been
entailed upon the owners. of the vessel.
The Curacao brought up twelve cabin and
eleven steerage passengers. Among the
cargo was a quantity of concentrates,
sulphates, ore and bullion valued at $150,
000. As soon as the steamer had landed
her passengers she went up to Selby's
smelting works to discharge the ore, con
centrates and sulphates. -

The wreck of the ship City of. Florence
as it lies In Halfmoon Bay was sold to
Rlngolskl Brothers of Oakland for $407 5)
yesterday. The cargo of nitrate that went
down with the ship was sold for $20. Latest
reports from Halfmoon Bay state that
the wreck Is surrounded by quicksands
and that nothing is visible of the hull ex
cept a small portion of the stern. Should
Rlngolski Brothers save the anchors and
chains alone from the wreck they will not
be much out of pocket on the purchase.
> A. M. Simpson's n*w schooner Churchill
Is now loading lumber at Coos Bay for
San Francisco. The vessel was originally
Intended for Captain James H. Bruce and
others, but there was some friction over
the manner In which the vessel was being
built, so Mr. Simpson seized the opportu
nity and offered to keep the vessel. The
other parties were glad of the chance to
get the craft eft their hands, but now
they, would willingly pay $5000 over the
contract price and take the Churchill.
It is several years ago since A. M. Simp
son said he would never build another ves
sel, and to emphasize that fact he named
the barkentine then nearing completion
Omega. A year or so later the building
craze seized him again and he laid the
keel of another vessel, which he called the
Addenda. The latest addition proved such
a success that Â¦ Simpson ordered ' another
vessel built and called her the Encore.
After the Encore was finished there was
enough lumber gathered together In the
shipyard â¢ to build another vessel, so the
Gleaner (gleaned from the left-over lum
ber) was put on the stocks. The echo
from the workmen's hammers had hardly
died away when another vessel was In de
mand, and the Echo Is now In commission
in consequence. 'After the Echo came the

The Santa Fe Company's new ferry
Fteamer. Ocean Wave, will probably hava
her first trial trip to-day. She was form

seven months she has been tied up at
Hay & Wright's ship yards In Oakland
Creek, being transformed Into a ferry
steamer. Her bow has been cut off ami

staterooms have all been taken out. The
date of her official trial trip has not yet

ONE of the most Epectacular con
flagrations that has occurred In this
city since the Baldwin fire called
out the department at 8 o'clock
last evening. The Yosemite Flour Mills,
the buildlnsr occupied by the California-
Italian Paste Company and the Custom
Grain and Feed Mills and several smaller
structures on Bryant street, between Sev
enth and Klghth, were consumed. The
loss Is estimated at $250,000, and owing to
high rates little Insurance was carried on
the property.
The Inflammable nature of the buildings
in the locality made the flre an extremely
dangerous one and for a time it was
feared that it would break beyond the
control of the firemen and sweep over
several blocks before it could be checked.
Through the almost criminal action of
the Market Street Railway system in re
fusing to shut off the electric current
which operates the Bryant-street trolley
cars the department was preatly handi
capped in its work. Live wires fell sput
tering Into the streets, sending myriads
of electric sparks into the air, endanger
ing the lives of the firemen, several of
wnom were slightly injured by the dealh
dealing current. Chief Sullivan intends
to call the attention of the authorities to
the action of the corporation and steps
will be taken to make it feel the force of
the law.
The lire was discovered by G. B. Deven
cenzi, who was working in the paste fac
tory. He noticed a small bl;ize In the al
leyway separating that building from the
flour mills, and started to give an alarm.
By the time he reached the street tongues

DESTRUCTION OF YOSEMITE MILLS. *.
which made excellent food for the de
structive Â«'lemont. An alarm was turned
in from the nearest box, and by the time
the department arrived the structure was
a seething mass of flames, which darted
high into the air, brightening the heavens
with their glare.
Chief Sullivan, appreciating that he had
a desperate battle before him, turned in
throe more alarms, calling out nearly
every fire apparatus in the city. Although
the flour mill was a four-story brick
structure, the heat of the flames was so
intense that its walls crumbled before
them and its entire interior wns soon
ablaze. When' there was no longer a
chance of saving the big structures, the
firemen turned their attention to saving
the adjoining property and confining the
conflagration to as small an area as possi
ble.
For a time the Franklin School, situ
ated on the same block, was threatened,
but It escaped with a scorching. The sa
loon of G. Catelli, adjoining the flour mill,
was consumed, and several families who
occupied the upper story lost all their
possessions. i--'- :
The origin of the fire is a matter of con
jecture. Lighted cigarettes carelessly
thrown in a rubbish pile in ihe alleyway
may have teen responsible. Another
theory is that sparks from a near-by
chimney Ignited some greasy sacks which
had been allowed' to accumulate near the
side of the paste factory.
Both the Yosemite Flour Mills and the
California-Italian Paste Factory were
owned and operated by C. R..Splivalo. He
places his loss at $25O.rXK). A portion of the
paste factory building was leased to H.
Autson, who conducted the Custom. Grain
and Feed Mills. Last night was his fourth
experience in being burned out. About
llfty men will be thrown out of employ
ment as a result of the fire.
Fireman Titus, an extraman of engine
21, was injured by a live wire. He was
taken to his home. Driver Hart -of the
same company was kicked by a horse
and slightly hurt. Police Officer George
Eastman fell over one of the guard rones,
smashing his nose and injuring a leg.
Jerry O'Keefe, an old man, tripped on a
piece of hose and In falling dislocated his
left shoulder. The latter two were treat
ed at the Receiving Hospital.
