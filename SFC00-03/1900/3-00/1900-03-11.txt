â¢ "Step into the cabin, ladies."
Inside the cabin our eyes had Ho, learn
to see, even though the door stood open.
The first thing I made out; was aVbox
whereupon I could sit, and the next 'was
a bunk wherein Charlie Wilson sleeps,
and the next was the fireplace. It is a
cavern of his own building/ a. stone-lined
hollow, big enough for a Fourth of. July

I said. ".Â¦Â¦'-.'â¢-â¢ ' Â¦Â¦ â¢" Vi-. 'Â¦'Â¦'.- . " i â¢>:
"And I have nothing to cook even for
myself part of the time," he answered. '
Then he drew from his /pocket 7 some,
dried leaves, but not before he had asked
permission to smoke.
"They are absinthium leaves," he said.
"Tobacco costs too much." He filled tho
black pipe and lighted It and sat before us
on^ariother box.
"More than forty years ago." he
wagged., "there were oniy a few American
ladies in San Francisco. Nearly all were
Mexican. But the, Americans -were com
ing all the time, and the people began to
see that it wouldn't. be long before-Amer

American . ilances. which .t were .'Â¦ Paris
dances in the first place. ' ; â¢

"In investing," he corrected. -y-'-. ?J
"I lost $21,000 in one day. Then 'l didn't
have much left, so I was glad to start my
dancing school, .and it thrived. . The
money slipped through Mexican lingers
and -my. pupils paid me well.
"They came -from, ranches, down m the
valley, and they came from San , Fran
cisco homes. I had a big tent put up in
the, part "of town,â well, I don't know
what streets you say now. I've lived here
In the mountains for ten years, and I
don't know much about the present San
Francisco. But my tent was near where
the postoffice stands now. It had a good
floor If It hadn't much else.
"The people were In such a hurry to
learn that the class came together every
.evening. ..Of all the pupils I remember
ueneral Vallejo best. The ladles all liked
to dance with him." ':
' VWas he a good dancer?"'
"No; none of thenvwere good dancers.
Their beads and their bodies were full of
their fandangos and they couldn't learn
the Paris way. You see. I was direct from
France at that time, for I had left Cali
fornia for a while and had spent three
months with my sister In Paris, studying
dancing: and music So' I was used to the
way things were done th*reâ more politely
I think, and not so free and easy 'as In
California. But these people never could
take up fashionable ways and stately
dances, and General Vallejo was IlkÂ© the
. "And still the ladles liked him?"
â¢The ladies? Oh. yes."
' "He was handsome perhaps."
'*Yes. handsome. To the Mexican ladles
that was the chief merit, but In the case
of General Vallejo there was more than
that, for he was courteous even to his
sistersâ really courteous, not in manner
only, as was the way with many of thÂ»
men."
"His sisters were your pupils, too?"
*! Yes. and his wife. The ladies were
brighter pupils than the gentlemen. But
they were all bad â very bad. 'Forward
and back!* I would cry. and they would
swing and move their arms as If they
handled castanets. It was trying," ha
broke off, in the disgust of a zealous
teacher.
"There was a senorlta." he went on
after a long pause; "all the youngr men
wanted to dance with her. She was not
beautiful, but she had yellow eyes, and
when women have yellow eyes men al
ways fall in love with them whether they
want to or not. She used to make prom
ises to dance and break her promises,
'and they were angry at each other and

he had said. To show us, he had
taken a doeen steps across his
bare cabin floor. The steps started brave,
ly and tried to be light; but instead they
were heavyâ heavy with the weight of 72
veart. Opposite the door they lagged and
at the bench they pave over entirely, and
old Charlie Wilson sank down and hid
his face behind both" snarled hands.
"I forgot," he moaned. "It used to be
the latest. That was forty years ago,
when I ml prosperous. - Dances chang*
and I change. Yes. I change. That

don't you know that you've changed? Old

Something like forty years ago. runs his
Ftory, Master Charles Wilson taught San

the sons and daughters of old Castile.

"Not a foot of it belongs to meâ not
even a tree." he told us.
It was daylight among the redwoods

noon. Back there in the heart of the

of here since the old steward died," they
had told me. "They say we're in the
way. But we keep on going and do the
best we can."
There was no turning but that night.
Velvety treading waiters glanced once
and forgot. Diners did likewise, until the
bonnets came very close and the tickets
were thrust so vigorously before their
eyes that they could be blind no longer.
What the first man at each table did, that
did the othersâ refuse, pay the 5 cents
asked or give more than the price and
turn double-chinned in benefaction. The
small manager of a large theater hid in
vain behind his mustache, for -the 'leu
tenant would have him out.. A swagger
professor, who Is kingpin of catches in
the co-ed world, gave for one ticket the
price of five in vanity of spirit. His neigh
bor, a slxth-iloor lawyer, had shaken his
head at first demand,* but his quarter fol
lowed the professor's.
. "Pretty good," chirped the lieutenant,
when she Joined us at the silent-hinged
door. She opened a severely businesslike
purse and counted with sharp eyes.
"You're mercenary, lieutenant," said
the cadet. Â¦.
"Well, ain't we out for money?" re
sponded the lieutenant.
"How much did you get?"
"How much did you?"
"I'm not very bold to-night. Sometimes
I do a lot better."
There was the tone and the look of mild
rivalry. â¢
"How much do you usually take in?" I
asked.
"Oh, we used to go as high as $10 in ai
evening, but we would be lucky with half
as much now. Times are harder."
The lieutenant snapped her purse brisk
ly and whisked us'into the next saloon.
Men were in a group at the bar. Groups
are not so easy as lone cases. "I wish
the adjutant was along," murmured the
cadet. "She knows how to go right into
a crowd, and she makes them listen. 1
hate a lot together," and she stood back
beside me. "The adjutant .ain't ht-re,
though,". chirped the lieutenant, "so- â "
Soâ she entered.
The group stopped talking and listened
indulgently. She did not talk salvation,
but' she talked meal tickets, and nobody
interrupted her. When- she had nniyhr-j

credit. -.:
heart." "Sweetheart" is the lassies* title
in saloons.
Sometimes a door was held open for us
to pass. More often it was not. â¢ "Come
on, girls, we can't waJt," one JohnniÂ«
said, !n a theater bar whose door he held
while we tarried.
"Did you get much In there?" I asked.
"No. We usually get little enough from
actors."
"And they usually get little enough
themselves." I defended, for player folk
are dear to me. But Salvationists are
hard to convince. "I told a fellow in thete
if he worked as hard as we do he'd be
cioin' pretty well." battled the officer.
There was a place on Ellis street where
somebody was telling a story when we
opened. the door, and he made for excla
mation points great swashbuckling oath?.
"Hush." said the barkeeper, and pointed
to us. N
Perhaps it was an apology for the oa f .hs.
At any rate, the story-teller bought five
tickets. They were all generoua in that
Ellis-street place. They talked a great
deal and drew U3 into arguments, but
they bought. I liked the man who said:
"I don't want any 5-cent meal or bed.
That's too' cheap. for me.".'
"Then you can pay more. sir. if you
like." quoth I. and the reason I liked him
was that he laughed and did so. i
A dime dropped on the way between a
big pudgy hand and the lieutenant's
pinched one. It disappeared in rubber in
tricacies and eight of us looked and saw
nothing of it. "I was going to take the
change, but I'll let you have the whole
dime if you can find It," said the pudgy
handed ipan. Then the crowd stood back
to watch the lieutenant search. She went
down upon well-worn knees with her eyes
turned down instead of pp and the r'.im-j
was given to her. "Good for you." chimed
the crowd. "It's yours." said the buyer.
"Shake, for luck," he cried as she rose
beaming. Then the lot of them cheered
her. So little it takes to constitute an
event io the midst of idleness.
Some attempted to listen to our explan
ation or read that on the ticket, but more
did not care what the thing was for, any
way. "What can we get for it?" asked
one, having refused. "A bath." vaguely
answered another, having bought. "When
does the event take place?" queried a
third, pocketing his 25-cent piece.
At the end of an hour we counted gains.
The aristocratic man with the smart
topcoat and the black , pull-down mus
tache leaned against the bar. He had
moved from the crowd when the lieuten
ant approached it and had buried hims.-lf
In his newspaper. It occurred to me that
he had not been fairly treated, and I made
for him, to atone for the negltct. And
when" I did so he drawled in the drawl
that goes along with a pull-down mus
tache:
"I just bought of your friend."
-.1 suppose he found that easier than' re
fusing. â¢
"When the adjutant goes she talks sal
vation," the cadet told me as we bent our
bonnets against a Market street brevzt.
"You see, that' is what she calls the real
object of the visiting, anyway. Of course,
she wants to rais* money for the homo,
but the purpose of the army is to get h<Jrt
of souls, and if the men grow 'interested
she set 3 in and talks. Don't she, though."
In the hour that we traveled we entered
only one saloon that was not of the sArll
est. That onj was a bit noisy, although
It quitted when we entered and the noisers
refused us civiily enough.' The only coin
I got there was from a colored man, who
paid exactly arid kept the ticket.
"I don't care for such places." said thÂ«
cadet with a dainty little sniff. "No beer
saloons for me." â¢
"They don't give in the beer saloons
and they . treat you rough." added tho
leader. "Let's go north of Market."
'Wo skirted the theater district, then
canvassed it. ', Lights were bright and the
streets were gay. for San Francisco is a
rose-colored picture on the. last night of
the week. It was an hour of plump pock

Those who wero eating at the lunch
counters did not buy. They always looked
gloomy, perched on their, high stools, and
they, always stowed away the food as if
it were stolen goods. They evidently did
not like to receive our attention. "Noth

"Bought one of those last week." "Don't

Those who had "dined mo^e comfortably

visited. Not bad.
The bona fide lassies left me, for they
were going to a meeting. Just before say
ing good-night we passed a lighted shop
window. It was snowy and fluffy In its
display of lingerieâ ruffles and laces and
ribbons, and among them was a worldly
doll attired in the daintiest of flippancies.
"The cute doll:" gasped the lieutenant,
who haa been for years in the work.
"Aren't those things lovely?" she gasped
again, and her eyes lingered wistfully.
"Why, lieutenant"' exclaimed the cadet.
"Come on. girls, it's late," said tha
leader, rousing herself. She turned eyes
and thoughts to the narrow path again.
It was the fleshpota of Egypt.

downtown men drift lazily through swing*

us Eivuns open the doois and followed.
We were women, but the bonnets gave us

Montgomery street saloons had hardly

at us lazily and most of the visitors tried
not to see us.

Â¦way to alleviate their condition SndHhat
was to establish a trade with the Califor
nia provinces, then in the flush of their
halcyon day**. This, however, was a
most difficult thing to accomplish. Spain,
always jealous of her treasure, had for-
bidden her colonies to trade with any ror
c!tjn jiower. and the ease-loving Califor
r.iuns had no desire to into any con
troversy with thoir rulers. To Rezanof.
however, nothing seemed impossible, and
after thoughtfully considering them.it
trr he determined to make an efCprt to
bring his plans to pass. With this In
View, he mailed, in the early spring/. for
the ccuthto open negotiations with the
Spaniards.
He anrhoreO in San Francisco Bay and
was received by General <le Arsruello, the
Comandante at the Presidio, with the most
lavish hospitality, and every courtesy was
paid him as a guest' of rank and distinc
tion. Rut to his propositions the' Span
iard would giv'! but one answer. Foreign
trade v,-;is forbidden . by his country and
that was enough for the soldier. The koy

only as his gue3ts. Anything else was Im
possible.
During the days of feasting which fol
1 owed Governor Arellago came up from
' Monterey to meet the distinguished
stranger, and the Russian tried him with
flattery and bribes, only to meet with the
same stern refusal. Disheartened by these
repeated failures, Rezanof had nearly
given up his project in despair when an
unexpected turn ]of â¢ events changed the
aspect of things and brought him a valu
able ally in the shape of General de Ar
gufllo's daughter.'
. At the age of seventeen the Senorita
Dona Concepdon de Arguello was con
ceded to be one of the most beautltul
women in nil of New
- - Spain. She pos
.^^. sessed the lustrous
"Â¦"â¢Â¦ 1 black hair and lan-
C I quid eyes of her
j race; a skin of pal-
C I est olive. which
I even the California
â¢ sun could not harm,
and a matchless fig

Vhlch T.a<f"fcrmed the theme of many .1
perenade, united to a remarkably sweet
and tender disposition, made her-a favor
ite with all who knew her. During the
first few weeks of the Russian's visit In
her father's housÂ«* she had kept somr
what alofif, but pity for his inability to
speak her language made her listen 10 his
entreaties that she would teach him
Spanish, and the lessons were begun.
Rezanof. although along in middle age,
and a widower, was a handsome man. of
strong personality, well versed in the
manners of the court, and skilled in af-
saw- a brilliant future for himself. Ac
cordingly he made a formal proposition
for the hand of Dona ConeepcJon.

Jose, it would hardly. have caused more
consternation than this request. Rezanof
was a heretic, and as such ineligible. The
church hurried to the protection of Dona
Concepclon. and threw its arms about her."
The idea of his daughter being transplant
ed to the snows of Russia filled the sren
eral with horror. All the pressure possi
ble was brought to bear upon the girl to
induce her to give her lover up. But ia
vain. She loved with .the ardor of a Span
ish woman, and she would have Rezanof
or none. The wilds of Siberia or the -loss
of paradise were one to her. so long a*
h* shared them with her^ Her tears and
entreaties finally won the father's con
sent, and having yielded he celebrated
the betrothal in a state which was long
remembered by' those who shared the fes
tivities. Rezanof lingered for> a white
after the gayeties were over, and found
that he had not been wrong In his sur
mise. As he wrote to a friend, he "man
aged this part of his Catholic Majesty as
he pleased after the betrothal."
Trade was begun between Callfornlan
and Alaskan ports, and having obtained
his object Rezanof sailed for the north
again, planning to return to Russia by
the way of Siberia and in two years' time
come back to claim his bride. .
Concepcion stood between the brazen
cannon that guarded the blue waters and
watched the ship that bore her lover sail
out of the bay until it was lost from sight
beyond the Golden Gate. Then she turned
away to dream through the time which
must elapse before she became his wife.
But. alas, two years, five, ten, went by.
and no tidings. Day after day the girl
would sit by the cannons, straining her
eyes over the lonely waste of the Pacific,
watching for a sail that never came. Her
patience was exhaustless. her confidence
unfailing. As Don Jose watched his
daughter's face, he swore a mighty oath
of vengeance- against the man who had
brought the anxious lines there. But even
he dared speak no word of blame to her
of the apparently faithless one. In splto
of her beauty and the many suitors who
would gladly have 'consoled her. she re
mained true to the man who had won her
first love.
She led a gentle and holy life, caring
for the poor of the settlement. The sick
and the dying saw in her their joy of
earth and hope of heaven, and the chil
dren whom she taught adored her. For
thirty-one years she hoped against hope,
then entered the Dominican Convent off
St. Catharine, at Benicla.
About five years later an American trav
eler, happening to pass through the place,
heard the story of Concepcion. and by a
peculiar coincidence it was through him
that she learned the details of Rezanof's
death. He had perished miserably In a
Yakut hut. in Siberia, of a fatal Illness
while on his way home. The American
had been traveling for a short distance
In his company, and after hl3 death had
gone. on and carried the news and a few
of his personal effects to the dead man's
family in Russia. He had almost for
gotten the circumstances, until bearing
the story of Concepcion de Arguello
brought it back to his memory. And so.
In this roundabout way, the faithful wo
man at last knew the truth. Notwith
standing the long years of trial which
stretched between her and her youth, this
news proved to be her deathblow. Almost
immediately after hearing It she began
to fail, and a few years later passed
quietly away. %
The Governor of Alaska had. been the
confidant of Rezanors plans, and at
tempted to carry them out. The colony

looked at her until they took the matter in hand. So it
has been with us all. Each owes, and admits that she
owes, her happiness largely to one or more members; of
the club, which has now been in existence for four
years. Within that time three* of us have married,
three more are engaged to men they might never have
seen, had the club not existed. At last, Sybil, it is
your turn."
"But I don't count," said ' Sybil. '"You girls only
took me in because I was a little beast and listened to
your plans. So 1 had to be initiated, and take the
oaths which bound us. because you were afraid, other

"As you were only sixteen it did not seem likely that
you could either need or give help for a long time to

arrived when the club can be useful, to. you. You. are
invited to spend a month at a charming house in Nice,
full of smart people: one of the richest men iir England

of Lady Fanshawe's, you would be bound to sec a good

"But I don't and I can't." interpolated ( ,Sybil.
"That's where we come in ;" Maud.- grandly swept
away the interruption. "How much money 'would you
need to engage a maid (you couldn't .travel alone, and
your respected Aunt isn't asked), pay- railway, fares,"
and fit yourself out for a month's campaign?"?
"I might do it all, with strict economy,- on- eighty or

"To. see Nice, Ito buy some pretty, frocks? and, V.<?o

by a girl who had seen nothing, had, ndi pretty frocks,
and had never been on a yacht. . At all events, it was
not to be resisted by Sybil Hampton/Maud had clev-
â¢ It was a copy of the 'agreement she had.sijrned ior

so worded that her purpose in coming to Nice was un

not besn omitted. , â . â,â ,ââ
-Sybil had not dared to leave the paper at home, leot
her aunt's prying eyesshould find it, therefore she had
brought it away with her. and had sewn it (.concealed in
a home-made bag of blue ribbon) into a pair ot stay,.
Tc-dav she was wearing others, and had been too pre
occupied to remember the bag's contents, even it she
could have dreamed of Murray's treachery.
Having read, she was for a moment too utterly dum
foundctl to snea!:; but the estimable one tilled .up the
pause. . -'\v; Â»
"A poor girl must, think of her own interests, miss.
And Sir Thomas Lawrence sees the original ot tms

"It won't be for your advantage to use 'ard names,

"Vyhat they have, they shall keep. And you shall

On a chair in a corner lay Murray's hat, and her
cloak neatly folded. She 'put them both on. It seemed
to Sybil, who watched each movement in a kind ot
evilfasdnption. that her face lookcd'like a snakes.

when he knows. Call the police, miss, as soon as you
like, do; but you can't expect me to wait for 'em. Good
PART lII.â THE FINISH.
Murray slipped away, leaving her late mistress
stunned. Sybil felt sick, with a cold weight as of tons
of ice on her heart: and it seemed that she had.sud
denly grown 'old. What a different girl she was from
the one who had laughed (half ashamed even then),
with the members oi the Engagement Club, at the rich
grocer, who was a fair target for Cupid's darts! How
different the whole world was. now; and how beautiful
it might have been ifâ but there had always been an
tifl in Sybil's life.
She had told herself when she broke away from her
lover that she must write him a letter, telling him that
she could never be his wife, and that if he loved her he
must not ask" why. It would be easier to write the
things ;that he would not let her speak; and he would
be too! chivalrous, after the appeal she meant to mike,
to open the question again.
But now she could not even write. She hoped yet
that Murray's scheme Would fail; that she might miss
Sir ' Thomas Lawrence, or that he might refuse to see
her. But she dared not count on failure. She could
never look the man she loved in the face again, even
with uncertainty in her mind, thinking that he misrht
have! heard the* disgraceful story. â¢ Now that Murray
had gone.' Sybil could not feel safe for a moment. She
too must goâ at', once. 1 'Â¦
' "Most'oflthe hundred pounds had been:; spent, on
lovely frocks and other pretty things, which", girls who
.aim to "be "smart" and " in the swim" must have.
There had been her railway titkets and Murray's to buy
'also, and Murray's wages, on which by a pitiful story
.she" had been led only .this morning to make an ad
vance. But there was enough left to take her home,
[r Hastily, without waiting for reflection, driven blindly
lon.by the Â¦passionate desire to escape, since she was al
most certain to be found out, shescrawled an incoher
ent little note to Lady Fanshawe, full of regrets and
'gratitude. This she placed. conspicuously on her man
kt\. knowing that b>\ the evening at latest." it would
;surely.bc discovered. Then, with a small bae hidden
'under her long traveling cloak, she stole from the
house, luckily meeting no one.
i She did not kno.v at what time she might hope for
a train to Marseilles, but it would be something even to
: gct out of Nice, in any, direction, before Sir "Tom"
JLawrence's accusing eyes had looked into hers.
I There was not. she discovered at the bijr railway
'station, another through express until nicrht; but she
(could go as far as Cannes, if she chose, and wait there.
She did choose; and an hour and a half later a forlorn
figure was wandering along the Promenade de la Croi
â¢sette.in the blue, moonlit darkness, and shivering in the
! wintry chill of the Riviera nicht.
i 'Â¦Â¦ She did notknow .that she was cold and hungry; she
[only "khew that she was utterly miserable, and that for
iher the -world had -suddenly; come to an end. She
wished that she might come to an end, too. as she stood
still to gaze wistfully at the 'sea. The path of moon
light on the black water looked cold and cruel as a
sword of steel. No one here in Cannes knew her; no
one cared what happened to her. "What is to become
of me?", she murmured half aloud.
"You're going to be my wife," said a well-known
voice, and there was Sir Thomas Lawrence.
She started as if he had struck her; but he gave hsr
no time to fly.
"I tried the railway station at Nice," he said quite
-coolly, though he had caught her hands, and held them
as if in a vise. "So it was easy enough to find out
what train you had taken. I followed in a special. I
never could stand waiting for anything I wanted, you
see. I thought I'd caught sight of you, five minutes
ago, but it's so dark, I couldn't be sure till this instant.
My darling child, your hands arc like ice."'
"So is my heart," she cried chokingly. "You know â
everything." . -
"I wish I did!" "he exclaimed. /'But I'm not so wise
as you think. I suppose you mean â I've seen that wo
man. Well. I haye â the little beast! She met me in
the street, and said she had a message from you; and
when I'd sent her about her business, I hurried back to
Lady Fanshawe's â you were gone. Nobody know*
but Lady Fanshawe and myself, and nobody will know;
' for it's only seven o'clock now and my special will
take us both back in time for half- past eight dinner." *
"I can never go back," said Sybil in a frozen voice.
"Oh, why. did you follow me?"
"To tell you, first of all, what a huge laugh I've had
â over that woman's story. It is the best ioke.l ever
heard." ' Â¦ . , â¢ Â¦ "- \ . .
"But it's true â true!: That's the reason I meant to
refuse your love, because â I couldn't be your wife
without confessing, and IâlI â I would have 'died sooner
than you should know:" { - : : *
"Then you are a very selfish little girl," remarked
Sir Tom, "and a very foolish one. too. . Jove!._. l

}T isn't as if any of us wanted him for ourselves," sa-d
Maud Kardwickc.
"Thank goodness, no, we're all provided lor,"
purred Kate Anderson with a restful sifih. (She
was the oldest and plainest member of the EngaÃemcrH
Club, and perhaps there were troubled recollections >>i
storm before haven in her mind.)
"Syb is the last of us," went on Maud, "and I realty
think it"s our duty to do well by her. None of you can
say she i^n't a girl to bring us credit."
The 6vc who had listened called up a mental vision
of the absent men.ber, and it -was sufficiently charming
to justify the spokeswoman's challenge.
"What would be the smallest amount she could man
age en?" asked Edith Warren, who had always been
practical, particularly since her marriage.
"She couldn't do it well under ninety pounds at
least," said Maud, "and if she didn't do it well, it
wouldn't be any use trying to do it at all. Pretty as she
is. she'll have dangerous rivals; and then there are lots
of emergencies one can't count on. We owe it to our
selves, if we go in tor this, to give her every chance."
"Dear me. that would mean fifteen pounds apiece for
the six of us," pondered Edith, with knitted brows.
"Yes," Maud admitted. "But I'll lell you what I'll'
do, girls. This is my scheme: and as I'm proposer, I
don't mind giving ten founds more than any one else,
and making the purse up to a round hundred."
"I've had- a lot of expenses, this. year,"v sighed or? Z
Drew, who was a bride. "But then, as you say. Syb'sl
the last of us, as well as the prettiest, and I'll try to man
age it if the rest v.i-1."
"If she's the prettiest, she ought to have gone off w:t:i
less bother," retorted Kate Anderson, with a certain
sharpness. "I'm sure nothing oi this sort was ever ar
ranged for any of us, yet see how well we have all done. '
"We all have money." said Maud, with meaning.
'"Sybil alone i* poor. Several little affairs fell throuEii
with most of us, before everything was satisfactorily set
tled, and this is to be the first hook Sybil has ever
baited. She is almost a child â barely nineteenâ and is
handicapped by her poverty and her impossible aunt.
This is a great opportunity ior her; she must not be al
lowed to lose it. or it will be a disgrace to the club. Be
sides, if she wins, we get our money back. This is a
part of the proposal.'
"Dees Sybil know?" asked Nora.
"Not yet â r.ot a word. In using the word 'proposal,'
I meant mine, of course, not hers; nor the one we want
her to get!" and Maud laughed. "When she lold me
tl-at Lady Fanshawe had taken a fancy to her. invited
her to spend a month at Nice, hinting that Sir Thomas
Lawrence wouid be there, and so on. the poor child had
no hope of accepting. Without a penny to pay.for her
fare, or a maid's wages, to say nothing of a lot of smart
frocks to compete with the other "maids in a market
garden.' what good was it to tantalize herself with the
[bought? She was on the point of writing to Lady
Farshawe that she was awfully obliged, but circum
j^ances beyond her control would prevent her from po
irg. when I appeared on the scene. At once I had a
brilliant inspiration, and without, letting Syb guess
what it was. i begged that she would put off answering
Laoy Farina a c's letter till the next day, when we
should tee each other at the club meeting. That's the
reason I wired you all to be sure to come, and to ar
rive an hour before the u.-ual time." Maud glanced at
the watch on her bracelet, a present from her lover.
"Syb n:ay turn up at any moment now." she went on,
"and we haven't yet reached a definite deci.-ioh. All
girls in' favor of the pool ray 'Aye;' all against it, 'No:' "
There was a chorus of "Ayes" more or less enthusi
astic; but without a dissenting voice.
"Good!" cried M2ud: "Now you understand why 1
wired the request that no member would come without
blank checks, or c*sh to the amount of fifteen, pounds
in her pocket." The meeting of the club was being
he.d in her studio (for Maud played at being an artist).
and hrstily emptying various pret:y odds and ends from
a Dresden china bowl, she passed it round with a grave
iace. "Might as well settle the thing up once for all,
and have it done with," she said, being secretly of the
opinion thr.t it was not well to delay in taking a wom:n

Ed;th Warren was the last to drop her contribution
into the bowl. "I thinV Sybil ought to sign an agree
ment that she will repay us within six months after her
marriage, if the thing comes oft." said she. as she slowly
bid en the accumulated mass of wealth three five-pound
r.otes.
As she spoke the door opened. "Miss Sybil Hamp
ton," announced a footman.
Sybil could not have come at a less opportune mo
ment. If she had waited rive minutes longer all would
have been comfortably arranged; and it would only hay?
remained to inform the youngest member of the club.
in the most tactful way possible, of the scheme so suc
cessfully organized for her benefit.
"What agreement am I to sign, girls?" inquired the
new comer, with a face expressive of curiosity and
surprise. It was also a face of great beauty. Some
day. when Sybil Hampton was twenty years older per
hap?. people would begin to perceive that her features
vcre far from regular, and that she was nothing so won
ccrful after all; but in the flower-bloom of her early
youth the was brilliantly lovely. The six older girls
were exquisitely dressed, and Sybil was in a shabby
blue serge and a straw sailor hat. which looked out of
keeping with the crisp December weather: but as she
came into the Â«tudio, the rose and pearl of her com
plexion, the violet of her eyes, and the gleaming chest
nut cf her hair, seemed to drain half the color and
charm of youth from the other 'faces.
"Sit down and have some tea, and we'll tell you
everything," promised Maud. â¢'_â¢ '
Sybil sat down, and was presently sipping tea and
nibbling a salmon sandwich. "Don't keep me in sus
pense." said she.
"We won't," answered Maud. - "This club, as you
i:re aware, is. called, among ourselves, the Engagement
Club. Outside.it is supposed to be a charitable organi
zation, and is known as the 'Golden. Rule Society' â an
appropriate (if somewhat misleading) name, since we
are certainly banded together to do to each other what
we would have done to ourselves. We all went to the
same school, we seven, and since childhood have been
intimate friends. Since we began to tuck up our hair,
and untuck our frocks, we realized and discussed to
gether the fact that charming girls as we all undoubted
ly were, we labored under certain disadvantages. In
the fir^t place ours is a small town, and singularly des
titute of men. Our fathers have money â most of them
â but not enough to class us as heiresses. There isn't
a title among us; we're just ordinary, good-looking,
middle class girls, without influence, great connections,
or money enough to make us prizes in the matrimonial
market. Yet we were all either romantic or ambitious:
we asked a pood deal of life, and we meant to have it;
f-n after much talk we banded together, vowing to help
one another to success in the marriage market. It was
through me that Edith met my cousin Jack Warren,
who wouldn't have bought the Firs and settled in the
neighborhood if I hadn't persuaded him. Then when
be casually mentioned, after a dinner at our house, that
'Edith Greenhall was a nice girl.' I did everything I
knew how to make a match. In return Edith persuaded
Jack to ask Captain Vance down to the Firs, after that
dance in London, when he and I first met. I admit,
frankly, that if his memory had not been jojrged in that
fzshion he would probably have forgotten all about me.
As it is, you know we have been engaged for six
months, and though I have the money, my grandfather
kept a public house, while his was an earl."

dances, and dinners, and drives, and teas at Escoffier's
and Rumpelmayer's, the other girls had come to th-i
conclusion that their game was up. As they were good
natured 'girls in the 'mainland there were other ex

: They all -thought that beautiful as she was. little
Sybil Hampton was Â». an extraordjnarily, lucky/young
woman, and that she ought to be;"wild with io><; in the
assurance that. "Sir Tom" was -head over ears^in .love
with her. If they could' have seen through the;'charm-,

Jieart, they would { have j been ' shocked : and/ surprised:
for in truth the girl Was far. from ". joyous. :Â« 'The more
certain she became that "Sir Tom" loved her and that
â¢she loved him ' in return, the deeper she __ waded *into
depths of misery. This was because, unfortunately, she
had a conscienceâ an unruly, restless conscience- that
refused to lie down and be quiet when she told it to.
.While the millionaire had been an unknown quan
tity, a mere money-bag to be annexed, -by beauty, the
girl who;had never loved had been able to; endure the
'position in which the club had placed her. But. now
that he was a living, breathing man. handsome, and gal

have pictured a lover to beâ she was weightedjdown by
a sense of shame and unworthiness almost greater than
she could bear. She hated herself, and. the thine she.
had done. If "Sir Tom" did not propose, she would
be wretched, because her heart cried out for his love.

she could not accept him without confessing the whole

with his fortune made in trade. Sybil had fancied the
possibility of -marrying", for money, if this chance the
club had given should bring an offer. She had never
been in Jove, and she contemplated such a bargain with
comparative callousness. The clubâ if not the country

But if. on the contrary, he laid his millions at Â¦' Sybil's
feet, and she* through romantic foolishness, refused
them, then she must come home owing the club a hun

at Lady FanshawcVfor a t day and a half. Sir Thomas
Lawrence was announced ; and behold, he was | neither
stuffynor elderly; nor was there. a "trade mark., visible
upon him. He was thirty-eight or forty perhaps, and
looked a knight by nature as well as by royal favor. It
was almost impossible to believe that the tall, handsome
man, with clean shaven, clear-cut features, keen,-hu

morning sea mists under the noonday sun. â¢* He was so
big and strong and masterful, that before he had let her
go. he; had nearly wrung a "yes" from her â though not
quite. She* did love' him a littleâ yes. a great dealâ but
there was something in the way; she couldn'tâ no. it
was impossible that she could tell what, r Well, at lea6t
she must 'think-rhe must' wait. She must have to-night
for reflection, s . ' .
She would certainly not have got it had not her maid
appeared, with a smug countenance and a wrap Which
Lady Fanshawe was said to have sent out to her. Sir
Thomas Lawrence's feelings toward the estimable Mur

neat figure tripping away behind^her; mistress, who had
insisted ong oing at once into the. house. But thev
would, have' been less amiable, could he have played
eavesdropper during the conversation which almost im
mediately after took place in Sybil's bedroom.
M "It wasn't Lady Fanshawe as sent you the wrap,
miss,"* announced the invaluable person who had trav
eled to Nice" as Sybil's chaperon as well as servant. "I
saw you from the window, a-going into the garden with
Sir Thomas,- and -I thought Mt was -getting about time

money for a specific purpose, and if she failed to carry
out her. part, she would be a hundred pounds in debtâ
a load which . appeared crushing to a girl who got.
through a year on ; forty.
She thought about this a great dfal during the jour
ney, finding.it difficult to look the irreproachably ex
cellent new. maid in the face; and was altogether ex
tremely unhappy. If she could have undone the agree
ment,'and been back again -in- the home grudgingly
made hers by a dyspeptic aunt, she would have undone
it. But into the' midst of her repentance broke .a
gleam of Riviera sunshine, a golden light on a sapphire
sea: she saw white-winged yachts in harbor: and red.
rocky shores;. and creamy houses set among palms; and
cactuses, and scarlet salvia^and plenty of happy, care
less-looking people who apparently . had nothing _ on
earth to do save to enjoy themselves in this bright,
warm world 'of enchantment; then straightway the win
ter .of discontent vanished from her memory. The
fact that she was a little adventuress who had borrowed
a hundred pounds on the chance that her pretty face
and new frocks might entrap a parvenu millionaire,
lately admitted into society, slipped down into some dim
corner of her brain; and she also became one of the
happy careless' onesâ here to enjoy herself, like the
others.
Her first pang of recollection came when she saw
Sir Thomas Lawrence. Somehow his name had
sounded elderly sss stuffy. He had -seemed fair game.

HINTS TO THE LADIES FAIR
ON THE VERY LATEST STYLES
FOR THIS SPRING'S WEAR
BLACK and white, says Dame Fash
ion and black and white you must
be from the tips of your toesâ !n
other words, hose which are zc
braic In make upâ to the top of your
pompadour, over which waves a feathery
aigrette or on which rest a black and
white bonnet. It is not new, this com
binction, eimply more popular and conse
quently found In every imaginable style
and material. And women should be
thankful. It is economy itself, almost
universally becoming; those few com
plexions which can't wear the one next to
the face can the other, and thÂ«-re you are.
In combining black and white one can
use her own judgment, havina the lines
most severe or soft and loose. Stitched
band?, fancy braids and heavy lace ap
plique are raon used, white satin being
the foundation for all the trimming.
For house wear ftunnlng gowns are
fashioned of crep<: de chine with broad
bands of white patin stitched in black.
The bands -vary in width, those on the
skirt lTirg broader than those on the
bodice. Tailor gowns whose Jackets have
broad revers arc faced with white satin
and then trimm<Â»d to suit the wearer.
Soft, f.utty fronts are worn with them,
and to the woman who does not like to
count the years she has lived they are Im
mensely becoming.
Black gowns for evening wear are very
much the vogue. They are made of net
heavily jetted cr of billowy chiffon or
clingir.g crepe. All have a decided flare
around the feet. The oodicesâ there Is
nothing to them, and the effect of snowy
enou'.ders and araa is dazzling.
J"or altcrsoon wear clack tsSeta. U very
smart and can be trimmed with chiffon
and white lace or with â¢ white machine
Pitching. Kven debutantes are wearing
them, but as a matter of fact they make
the girl wearer look older, and are better
suited to young matrons. ; â¢
The blouses for spring wear are entirely
new and very fetching. Accordion pleat
inps are playing an important \ part in
their making. One made of accordion
pleated white chiffon covered with a thin"
black gauze run with lines of beading in
black or some color is as dainty and be
coming as possible. The shirt waists to
wear in the morning or under a Jacket are
made of the soft satin. One very stylish
cue in black and white is in the striped
effect. There Is a small yoke In back, but
non^ In front, a double box pleat of white
satin, broad at me top and narrow at the
waist line with glass buttons for fasten
ing and a whitÂ«'"satin stock with a nobby
bow- completes the .waist.
A vÂ£ry girlish waist Is-made oftueked
white taffeta. Us particular feature being
a deep collar, which "Â¦Â¦ is- made, of several
pieces, one shorter than the "other. . The
high whlte'stoek has a bow of white silk
fastened in front. and the band covering
the opening is stitched. The separate
pieces of the collar may' have a narrow
black piping, the stock. stitched in black
and aleo the band down the front, carry-
Ing out the black and white. Some of
these accordion-pleated blouses have a
long tie of the same material accordion
pleated, the ends wide and falling to the
waist line.. Â¦
The satin-faced cloths . which were
worn this winter are to" be .-"worn this
ssrlns. only In lighter v.elghC Oac gown
made of thlfl material Is trlmmld with
the same material In white. The bodice
has a deep couar mad* of. three pieces,
one shorter than the other; each piece Is
edged with a narrow band of black velvet
and through the center of each piece are
small dots made of silk or by sewing on
a small black bead. ; The stock and ..vest
are of white. The 'bodice fastens a little
to the left with a jeweled buckle. The
belt Is of the white'; with, the .."velvet and
the tiny beads. The skirt Is pleated and
without trimming.; . v : '
A word about these't new skirts. . In the
cloth they are apt" to.b e a; trifle -iheavy
and. unless carefully made, clumsy.' 'xney
take a great deal of material, and the
woman whose gowns j must 'wear, longer
than one season would better think 'twice
before having {â¢ one 1 made7 '.:_ In \: summer
gowns it Is perfectly safe to -follow the
style: those which have: to be laundered
often are the only exception."- In: the soft
silks, challies and Jark; ginghams' the
pleated skirts are a 1a 1 good Investment.
Back to theblack and white effects. A
tea'gewn in theemplre ' prlncesse- effect,
made of black satin; with .an underdress
of stripped | black and white silk trimmed
with bands' of 'white! guipure -lace; looks
well, on a tall" woman. The yoke Ms', out
lined ,wlth the lace, and the \ sleeves i.'are
covered with bands of it. ..A; sash' of soft,
black satin' with; chenille fringed ends is
tied over one arm and falls to the floor.".-
The stocks to be worn with* the" black
and; white shirt waists or any shirt j are
many and pretty.; One of. the. newest la
of biack satin,, embroidered with- silver
beadfe. and. has long ends : of lace which
are xl eatc<^ to. the stock and are held in
place by. a silver buckle, \
Hats to be worn this season are a trifle
smaller than those of last. 'Coarse straws
and glittering/ gauzy things are going to
be the, correct things. And tulleâ tulle un
tll^you cannot; rest: Mn ; fact,, most of -the
hats are ".made entirely of f It- Hats of
fold "after fold of chlfi'Qh. with several
tints Introduced, are'ln good form; though
contrasts are not 'the; rule thla season.
One, ; to be perfectly gowned," must be all
one color from head to foot. Black lace
is much used In trimming, the thin, fine
varieties being given preference. And, by
the way. not only lace proper is the fad
of the hour, but everything which has a
lace effect. It is shown In cloth, silk or
panne cut out in guipure designs and
forms yokes and chemisettes and Is shown
in panels and deep insertions.
Deep corselet belts are very much in
vogue and are very friendly aids in tho
remodeling of old waists- Black velvet la
favored, aa it may appear in the cravat
as well. The belt Is fastened at one side
with handsome buttons or with a knot
and f rinsed ends. Panne Is better than
other velvet, as it drapes so easily.

The initial poem of the book is a mar
vel of strenRth and virility. It first ap
peared in the Sunday Call of October 15,
1SW. and frequent requests have been
made for a reprint. It is herewith given:
The fiwnnl of Gideon. Sword of God
Be with ye, Boers. Brave men of peace
Ye hewed the rath, ye brake the sod,
Te fed white flocks of fat increase
Where Saxon foot had never trod;
Where Haxon'foot unto this day
Had measured not, bad never known
Had ye not bravely led the way
And made such happy home your own.
I think CJod's house must be such home.
The priestess mothers choristers
Who *pln and weave nor care to roam
Beyond this white Ood's house of hers
But spinning sing and spin again.
I think such silent shepherd men
Must like that few the prophet sings â
Most Il!Â«e thet few stout Abram drew
Triumphant o'er the slaughtered Kings.
Defend Ood's house! I^et fall the crook.
Draw forth the plowshare from the cod
And trust, as In the Holy Book,
The Sword of Gidecfn and. of God;
God and the right! Knough to fight
A million reriments of wrong.
Defe-nd! Nor count what ccmes of It.
God's battle bides net with the strong;
And pride must fall. Lo, It is writ!
Great England's Gold; how stanch she fare*
Fame's wine cup pressing her proud lips â
Her checkerboard of battle squares
Uimmed round by steel-built battleships!
And jet mcanwhiies ten thousand miles
Â¦ ehe seeks ye out. Well, welcome her!
Give hor such welcome with such will
As Uoston cave In battle's whir
That red, dread day at Bunker Hill.
The last poem in the book has rather a
Kipling flavor- to it, and is such a big
hammer that It can hardly miss hitting a
few nails. Whether it will be appreciated
by Mr. Millfr's English friends mentioned
in his opening paragraphs or not Is an
other question. It appears under the title,
"Fight a Boy Your Size," and reads as
follows:
Hark, far back in that backwoods school
Of Lincoln, Grant and the great we prize.
We boys would' fight, but we had one rule
You must fight a boy of your eize.
Or white boy or brown, aye, Boer no doubt,
Whatever the quarrel, whatever the prize.
You must Etand up fair and so fight it out
With a boy somewhat your size.
But a big boy spoiled so for fights, he 'did,
He HeU most dlDlomatlc-like lies *'*>.
And he fought such fightsâ ye gods forbid-
But never a boy of his size.

Mr. Fitch's play is presented in' four
acts. The first act o;Â»en3 with a scene in
the Union Grammar School house. New

as the school teacher and very much in
love with one of his fair pupils, Alice
Adams. Hale Is temporarily absent, the
school being In charge of his assistant.

scene with news of the battle of Lexing

with him as their leader, despits the re
monstrances of Fitzroy, the would-be
lover of Alice Adams and an officer In the
English army, who has come to call a
meeting of Royalists in the s*choolhou-Â»e
The act closes with Nathan the accepted
lover of Alice Adams and the announce
ment of his intention to join the Contlnen
â¢tal army.''
The next act is laid a year later, and In
,it the dialogue shows Fitzroy ' Ftlll an
English officer but regarded In the light
of a blackguard, while Nathan llaie's
great deeds are on every lip. Alice i?
still constant, and a very pretty scene
takes place between her and Nathan upon
their first meeting since thÂ» school days.
.The Continental army is in bad straits
through lack of information of the con
templated movements of the English
forces, and at a- meeting of the American
officers a volunteer* is called- for to go
through the lines, and act, as * a spy.
Nathan,. volunteers and is accepted, al
though there is a storm of protest from
his fellow-officers, with whom he is a
great favorite. Alice, who, has overheard
the conference and its "result, rushes. Into
Nathan's ; arms and implores, him not to
go., The act. closes with this powerful
scene between Hale and .his betrothed.
True patriot, he risks his life's dearest
love for the sake.of.hl3 country, "bows
his. head and slowly goes from the room.
Alice, with -a . faint, heart-broken* cry,
sinks limply to'the floor, her father hurry-

The nest two acts witness the success
of Fltzroy In, accomplishing the doom of
Nathan, Hale and the curtain falls with
the martyred patriot at the foot of the
gallows. .

just a? the eight-fcot whistle proved too

In brief the plot of Mary Paget is as
follows:
A yoisrsr English girl, betrothed, to a
poritaslcaJ <<>upin. falls in love with a
i n v.-.li' r recently returned from the Ber
mudas. He wins her, as did Othello his
Desdt-iTjona, by telling of his most won
drous- adventures In distant lands. Mary
is a scattrr-brainrd young niss. and what
might have been made a charming love
scene is told as follows:

Mary is stolen away br her cousin, the
puritanical villain, and here again Is an
opportunity for the author to attain great
dramatic possibilities, but the incidents
are tamely related. Mary escapes, and
under thÂ» impression that Collingwood
lias .sailed for the Bermudas, she and her
maid embark for the distant isles. The
Fhip passr-s through a series of adventures
iind finally arrives at her destination, not,
however, until the sailors have been
alarmod by 'he appearance of a-sea-ser
iwnt .it the harbor's entrance. Mary rinds
that her lover has not arrived and spends
many weary days of watching and wait
ing. Finally the hero comes. Her recep
tion of. him is peculiarly maudlin:
Toward the hour of midnight I caw a tall,

.But the whole story has a counterfeit

Johnston's story Â»nd Its descriptions are

is supposed to tell the story with the

Why Whisky Is Sent to Sea.
Large shipments of whisky In bond will
be made from Baltimore to European
ports within the next month or two. says
the Baltimore Sun. A shipment of 1500
barrels is now nearly ready for export,
and about 4000 barrels more will soon be
ready.
While some of the whisky will be sent
by Baltimore owners, the most of It will
be from Cincinnati and other Western
cities. After being kept In European
warehouses for six months or a year the
greater part will then be brought back to
this country for sale.
The whisky to be sent out Is of the 1891
and ISO 2 distillation, which must be taken
out of the bonded warehouses because the
eight-year limit has expired. Whisky
may be stored in a bonded warehouse
eight years without being subject to tha
internal revenue tax of $1 10 a gallon. At
the expiration of eight years It must be
taken out. Rather than pay the tax and
lose the use of the money until the sale
of the goods, some owners prefer to ship
their surplus stock to the other side and
store It there until needed, claiming that
the cost of freight both ways and storage
in Europe *vill be less than the cost of
meeting internal revenue requirements at
a time when there is no demand for the
goods. The tax is t only required to be
paid when whisky Is put on the market
for consumption, so that goods shipped to
Europe in bond are not. taxed. They are
brought back as required by the demands
of the market here. Goods remaining In
the cotintry out of bond are supposed to
be on the market.

etiise. He is not a silver-tongued speaker
whose words drip honey-sweet to the ear.
His tongue Coc-s not trip daintily through
& maze of similes and metaphors and
flowery finales. His flow of language is
remarkable, but it plays on the ieart-
Ftrings rather than the ear drum. He
tpeaks rapidly, never hesitates for a
Â¦word, and his diction is forceful and cor
rect. Every man in the audience feels
that Jack is talking at him, and to him,
exclusively.
"Won't you please let Christ into ycur
soul?" he says in pleading boyish treble.
"Just say 'Lord come,' and God will en
ter. He is waiting to-night and surely
you will let him in. God is the only dis
infectant for your soul. Take him, rake
him; oh take Christ Into your souls." And
men and women who would listen un
moved to the same words from older llp-i
cannot resist the childish pleading- that
vibrates in the boy's appeal.
Gospel Jack is perfectly natural and un
affected. His gestures are spontaneous
and boyish, though very graceful. He
thrusts his hands into his trousers pock
ets, clinches his little fist or rumples his
blonde hair as naturally as though he
were a boy talking to boyish friends in
stead cf a lad leading men and women to
God's altar.
"He has learned a lot of well rounded
sentences, generalities that he can fit to
any text," say the skeptics. Their name
is legion, but they number among those
who have not personally heard him. For
to hear Gospel Jack answer unexpected
questions so wittily and so wisely, to lis
ten to him preach, keeping reasonably
close to the selected text, is to be con
vinced that the boy has a remarkable
quickness of thought and a still more re
markable fluency. of speech. You must
grant him these powers or enroll yourself
among the theorists who claim the boy
was hypnotized by his grandfather, whose
ghost prompts htm, or that somebody un
der the platform ventriloquizes while Jack
simply goes through motions, and count
less other absurd theories.
Jack on the platform at 10 p. m. full of
religious fervor and eloquence is not at
all like the Jack who at' 10 a. m. must i.wÂ«
a camera. Like any other 13-year-old boy,
he' dislikes having his picture taken.

Treasure Hunting in Greece.
Some remarkable treasures have just
brought-up by Greek divers from the
bottom of the sea at the spot where the
famous naval battle of Tschescnme took
place 130 years ago.
Tscheschme is in the Aegean *Sea. eft
the island of Chios, and there, on July 5,
.1770. the Russian and Turk/sh* fit^tÂ»^e>-.
â¢ gaged in fierce battle, with the result that
two famous Russian men-of-war were
sunk and several Turkish vessels were"
burned and destroyed. At the spot where
one of the Russian men-of-war went
down the water is from twenty-seven to
thirty meters deep.
The first treasure which they discovered
at this point was a che3t containing 12.000
pod ducats. Soon afterward they found
many other articles of great value, in
cluding an iron box with 2000 gold piec;s
of various denominations, many ban<3
some copper vessels, a large and massive
' gold goblet, several costly pieces of sil
verware and a large number of firearms.
It is thought likely that yet other treas
ures will be found, but in any ca3e the
Turkish Government has determined to
make a thorough examination of the en
tire sea bottom covered during the fight.
It is known that there wa3 a large quan
tity of bullion on the Turkish vessels
which went down.
Naval officers throughout Europe are
taking much Interest in this search for
long lost' treasure, and the question is be
ing asked whether submarine boats could
not be* used for work of this kind in other
places. Indeed, It is claimed that such
boats may eventually prove to be of
greater service in this respect than they
ever will as destroyers of men-of-war.

tined to become quite popular is the "Ad

st Manila, and the trousers are lone and
f.arir.p at the bottom. Then there is a lit

embroidered on the front. A cap with

up the outfit. The suit is made of cither
yacht cloth or cheviot, and is won: by
children of between 3 and 12 years.
The striped goods, which have been so
popular with the well dressed men of late,

order, with side pockets. goo<i and strong

W.D. Howells' Views on
Life , Death and Success.
TV. D. Howells is the subject of an
teresting study- by .Theodore* Dreiser .in -
Ainslee's for March. -The writer relates
a' serious. conversation held with the nov
elist. - '
"How the talk came around to specula
tion concerning life and death is almost
beyond recall. Andrew Lang had newly
reissued his translations of Greek odes.
They deal with the passions and pains of '
individuals dead thousands of. years ago, .
and I expressed wonder at the long, inex-?
plicable procession' of life. -â¢ --k
"Mr. Howells' folded his hands calmly
and sat quite silent. Then he said, 'Yes,
we never know wherefrom or whereto.^ It 1
seems as if all these ruddy crowds .' of
people are little more than plants .waken
ed by the sun and rain.' .
" 'Do you find,'. 'l said, 'that it is pain-;
ful to feel life wearing on, slipping away'
and change overtaking us all?' .
V 'It is, truly. /Life is fine. The morning
air is good. When I stroll out of a sunny
day it seems too much that It sho-uld not
stay and endure.. It Ms -wistfulness that
overtakes us, all .the more bitter because
so'hopeless*. . "Every Â¦ one suffers from it
more or less."
"From the flight of time and ever im
minent death, the conversation drifted to
the crush of modern life and the struggle
for existence- .
" 'lt is ray"* belief.' he said, 'that- the
struggle really does grow more bitter.
The great city surprises me. It seems so
much a to-do over *-.i littleâ millions
erowdfcig into to obtain' subsistence' in a
region where. subsistence is least.'
" 'Where! would : you have them go?'
" 'There are; more fertile .parts of the
world. 'This' little island is so cold and
bleak a great many'months of the year.
Nothing is grown here. When you come to
think, there is no reason why the people
of the wbrld should not live inithe tropics.
The means of subsistence there are great
er. "Yet here they, are scheming and plan-
nlng. and sometimes dying or starvation.*
" 'You have had no direct experience o!
this great misery.' .
."'No; but I have observed it. All my
experiences have been literary, yet in this
field I have seen enough.'.
"'ls it sohard to rise In the literary
world?'
â¢ ".'About as difficult as in any other
field. There seems to be almost invariably
a period of neglect and suffering. * Every
beginner feels or really finds that the
doors are more or leas closed against
him.'
" 'Your I view is rather dispiriting.'
V 'Life seems at times a hopeless tangle.
You can only face the conditions bravely
and take what befalls.' ,
'.'Other things were talked of, but thi3
struck me at the time as peculiarly char
acteristic of thoâ man. His . sympathies
are riyht; but he la not primarily a deep
reaso'ner. He -Â¦ would not, for .instance,
choose to follow up hia speculations con
cerning life and attempt to offer soma
modest theory of improvement. Â¦ He
watches the changeful scene, rejoices or
laments over the various and separate in
stances, but goes no further. He has
reached the conclusion that Ufa Is diffi
cult and inexplicable without . really
tracing the various theories by 'which it
is synthetically proved. -He Is inclined to
let the great analysis of things- go by thtj
board, sure that â¢ it is a mystery and not
caring much for the proof." :
THEi have some wonderful things
out there on the revenue cutter Mcj ,
Culloch, which is' now lying in the
bay. Some things they have taken
from the conquered Spaniard anfl
others that mude thlags livV at
Manila, 'cross the way, on the never-to
be-forgotten first of May, 1898. There are
charts, flags, cannons and cats, - all of
which were mixed up to a' great extent in
our late trouble with Spain. -
There is very little'need to tell any ons
that the. McCulloch was Dcwey's dispatch
boat at the time the Spanish fleet was set
a-slnklng at Manila: that she stuck her
little, white, inquisitive. nose right Into
everybody's business and didn't give a
rap whether school kept or not: that' she
simply, turned her guns loose and tnrewjk
iew pounas or leaa at the Spaniards,
which pounds'; were, by the way, part of
the first charge fired at the Spaniards by
the Americans in this great battle. Â¦
The man who. fifed the shot is aboard,
too, and he doesn't look like a man who
would start an argument either,. but more
like a man 'who;could(end"one on short
notice. -his arguments '.being more in the
line of act.lon thari-inVords. His name is
IJeutenant M. Atlee and he fired the first
shot from a six-pounder on the starboard
side: There is nothing very surprising
about the six-pounder. . It is Just like any
other Hotchkiss .six-pounder and " has a
long blue . barrel and some mechanism at
one end that would puzzle a landlubber.
There are two interesting revolver can
nons aboard, made in France.' mind you,
but engraved and marked with Spanish
lettering. They came from a Spanish ship
and were used in a vain attempt on May
1 two years ago. by the Spaniards. But
the Spanish lettering on the guns was in
tricate and the gunners got mixed in
their figures: as a consequence these two
guns "now ' occupy ! first-class positions -in
Uncle Sam's navy, and the men aboard
the McCulloch do not need an interpreter

The house-to-house visits of the officials,
the removal of the sick, and the inocula

detention hospital, are- calamities far
worse than the plague. They break down
caste barriers, and rather than lose caste
the native courts death. j
Many are the devices employed to hin
der the health officials. One of .these offi
cials told me that it was a daily occur
rence to find plague victims placed in liv
ing attitudes so that the family might
bury the dead and their house escape fu
migation. On one occasion an official en
tering a house saw five men seated
Rroiind a table playing cards. He found
nothing suspicious In the house, but upon
returning to the cardroom happened to
place his hand on one of the players. . It
was a dead plague victim, who had been
propped up at the table. Another time an
old woman in a most lifelike attitude, her
hands in tho dough as if kneading it, was
found v to have been dead several hours.
My work in the hospital was most try
ing. The pity and suffering of it all could
never be described. During the cold
months the plague is at Its worst. Death
comes swiftly to the- plague "victims.
One morning I drove by a house and
stopped to speak to the master. At 5 in
the afternoon I passed again and found
this same house being whitewashed by

1. lived !n India not as an outsider or
an onlooker, but so close to the heart of
that complex nation that 1 could hear its
throbs of suffering. Most of that time I
was in charge of one of the Lady Dufferin
hfi?pltals and the remainder was spent
practicing amon? the "shut in" women.
P.mken in health I loft the stricken
country where the bacilli of pestilence
taints food. soil, air and water, and the

firrs flashing crimson streaks against the
blue heavens.
In distant California I thought to see
cr hear nothing that would remind me of
the- frightful, almost unearthly scenes of
my daily Jife In India. But on the cvÂ«
of ~iy relurn from India comes this cry
of terror from Hawaii. It is answered
here with much sympathy, but too little
real understanding of this menace to
Christendom. Passengers just beyond the
harbor who chafe under quarantine find
sympathizer* on shore who think these
strict precautions unnecessary.
California cannot be too careful. The
dread plague that is reaping its death
harvest in the lovely island of the Pacific
will take advantage cf the slightest open
ing to creep !n and gather its quota of
victims from your land. Remember that
the Mack plague is almost as mysterious
end as much cf a problem to-day to the
men of science as when It first appeared.
Though it has raged four years in Bombay
'â¢ etill claims as many victims annually as
were the forerunners of .the epidemic in
India. Beware of the rats in the holds
of vessels that have sailed from infected
shores. If they crawl ashore they may
carry the plague in their trail. Â¦
The conditions are more favorable in
India for the plague than In almost any
other place. But the rest of the world
should look well to the ourtce of preven
tion, for H pound of absolute cure has not
yet been discovered for this plague that
has extended Its scope over a quarter of
India and out to Zanzibar, Mauritius,
Madagascar and Eastern Africa, to Man
churia and Central Asia. Now it is seek
ing to establish its reign of terror In Ha
waii.
Wherever you go. wherever you turn In
India you cannot escape the plague.
Whether in Bombay. Poona, Sharapoor or
Calcutta.- which are plague centers, or in
some less infected district, "plague" is
the pivot on which the conversation
turns; and plague precautions make rail
way traveling one Ions: series of medical
examinations. You are, turned out of
your compartment almost every daylight
hour to be examined', and at night jou
slowly awaken while strange hands fum
blo under the blankets to take your
pulse.
As I said before, conditions in India are
peculiarly favorable to the plague.
Health officials are, confronted by the
rules of caste, the privacy of the home
and the sequestration of the women, and
the violation of these customs is more
feared by the natives than the plague it-
but as a physician my lite In India Aid

gayety. Outside of the hospital my pri
vate practice was In the zenana houses,
which is the name, for the homes of the
purdah ladies or Mohammedans. of high
caste. In the zenana are four. "five, six
or more wives, but they each have their
own apartments with separate entrances,
like so many flats, as It were, and never
see each other.
They are never permitted to gaae on any
man save their husbands, and lead Idle,
contented lives with a flock of attendants.
The innovation of women physicians ha 3
wn ught groat relief to. them, as they
were denied the services of the male phy
sicians. Speaking their language I was
able to converse with them about their
livts and found with very few exceptions
that these "shut In" women are perfectly
content, and even given the opportunity
have no disposition to question about the
great outside /world of which they know
nothing.
It mny be new and interesting to many
to read how the Lady Dufferin hospitals
for native women were established. Some
thing like ten years ago an enlightened
native woman begged a returning English
tourist to present to Queen Victoria, with
assurances of her loyalty, a magnificent
jewel and to tell her Majesty of the need
in India for hospitals for" the native
women.
When .Lord Dufferin was appointed Vice
roy to India the Queen asked Lady Duf
ferin to look into the need of hospitals
for native women. Lady Dufferin did not
have to stay many weeks in India to
have her sympathy aroused. The result
was the establishment of many hospitals
for women, all named after her. The par
ent society for the Lady Dufferin hospi
tals Is in Calcutta. The wealthy natives
When the rest is consumed the feet are
submitted to the dying embers, which are
incapable of wholly destroying them. "At
last the fire burns out and the ashes are
collected in a large wooden box. The bits
of boneâ relics of the last part burned in
the dying flamesâ are collected and put
into a small 'vase. , Â¦
Rich- Hindoo? take this vase to "scatter
its contents on the Ganges, usually wait
ing for one of the great religious holidays)
upon/which to perform the hallowed act.
When the relatives of the dead are not
able to afford this pilgrimage they enclose
the, vase in a cloth and hang it upon a
tree, with the dead one's name upon it,
until it can be taken to the Gangesby
wealthy mourners of other dead, or by
a pious pilgrim journeying to this sacred
spot. The box containing the mixed-up
ashes of the dead and of firewood is
emptied into the water.
The. Parsees, which means Persians,
have the most peculiar way of getting rid
of their dead. The Parsees have lived In
India many centuries and are a very
wealthy class of natives. They admire
and cultivate progressive ideas and per
mit their widows to marry again, unlike
the Hindoo women, who must commit
Bulclde and are otherwise degraded when
their husbands die.
Fire is sacred in the belief of the Par-
Bees, therefore they destroy their dead
without burning the bodies. Instead they
feed them to the vultures that flock upon
the Towers of Silence, which the Parsees
have built for their dead.

declared that any attempt to take either

lieved this precaution was altogether un

( While the police were guarding "the State"

to .emerge from there it is probable from

At" any' rate, when'the Chesapeake and

half as many deputies were there, to see
if either of these men attempted to board

rushed upon the cars. l^Lieutenant* Colonel

bluecoats piling up on the train.
'''So. nothing the matter unless you de

and, with another jerk .of the rope the
train was off and-,the men were speeding
toward Lexington. "". When the train j first
pulled, out most- of the crowd, including

and 'who saw the soldiers as they made

and Davis, angina few minutes the city
was inflamed with the information. Chief
of Police Williams immediately sent tele

the road, notifying officers of the escape
and ordering them to be on the ' lookout.
The - train makes no stop between here
and Â¦â¢Â¦ Lexington, but these steps were

of ultimate terms of peace and no
member of ' the Cabinet has au
thorized any published statement
on the subject: It is, of course,
generally understood among all
political parties in this country
that so far as the South African
republics are concerned the
status quo ante bellum cannot re
main unaltered after the close of
hostilities. Only then can the
Ministers finally formulate terms
of a settlement and make a pub
lic announcement of their plans.
In military clubs yesterday the
desire for peace was credited to
the enemy and very freely dis
cussed. While a speedy termina
tion of the war is considered de
sirable the consensus of opinion
seems to be that the Government
would be wanting, in its duty to
the War Office and to the army
generally if it negotiated in any
way until the British flag flies
over Bloemfontein and Pretoria.
This spirit, military men say,
ought to characterize any reply
to the Boer overtures from Eng
land.
From another quarter it is as
serted that President Kruger is
attempting to gain time in order
to complete preparations against
the British advance in the Trans
vaal, but this apparently is mere
speculation.
SPECULATION IS RIFE
REGARDING EARLY PEACE
LONDON, March 11, 2:20 a. m.â ln the
absence of important news from the seat
of war. speculation is rife "regarding the
probability of an early peace. President
Kruger's appeal to Lord Salisbury for a
cessation Â¦of hostilities, announced on
Friday, is taken as foreshadowing that
the end will soon.be in sight. The Gov
ernment's views are probably enunciated
in the following semi-official statement,
issued last night:
"It Is understood that the Government
does not consider that the time has yet
come for any authoritative statement as
to ultimate terms of peace and no mem
ber of the Cabinet has authorized any
published statement on thw subject. It
Is, of course, generally understood among
all political parties in this country that,
so far as the South African republics are
concerned, the status quo ante belluni
cannot remain unaltered after the close
of hostilities. Their part in the system
which Involved a large measure of politi
cal and military independence will, of
course, be materially modified as a result
of the war,' but the growing prospects of
restored peace must be further advanced
before her Majesty's Government can
THE RELIEF OF LADYSMITH.
Closely following the main body of Buller's army came the real relief to the half-starved;,, garrison * of., the .long-be
leaguered little town. The railroad between Colenso and Ladysmith was almost totally; destroyed by; the Boers, but long
trains of wagons with the much needed provisions were ln>walting at Colenso, and as soon as' the way \ was -open*, they
pushed with all speed to where they were long expected and much needed. The first train of seventy-three wagons entered
the town even before a part of General Buller's troops, marching fronvthe last battle ground rat â¢PI etars. Hill, 'four miles
nearer, reached the place. The promptness of this substantial relief speaks well for the confidence of ' the British com
mander In the outcome of his plans and the thorough organization of his transport system. v . ; . ,â¢; - - '

QUEEN VICTORIA'S
INSPECTION OF TROOPS
LONDON. March 10."â Queen Victoria
brought her visit to London to a close. this
evening and returned to Windsor after, an
inspection of two battalions of the Guards.
Throughout the day vast crowds gath
ered outside Buckingham Palace and
along the advertised route to the railroad
station, and when the royal carriage
finally started for Hyde Park on. its way
to Paddington the enthusiasm broke out
into cheers, which were unbroken until
the train departed. , .
Previous to leaving the palace there wan
a brief but interesting ceremony on the
grounds, where 2000 khaki-clad guards
men in full marching order were drawn
up for the final inspection of her Majesty
before their departure for . South Africa
on Wednesday. Real Queen's weather en
livened the scene with bright- sunshine
and the .temperature as mild as May. The
Queen, accompanied by ,. the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess
of Tork, Prince and Princess Christian
Of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess
Beatrice, drove slowly along the line, and
the Duke of Cambridge, who was present
as honorary colonel of the Grenadiers.
Her Majesty expressed admiration. for the
splendid appearance of the men. After
the inspection cheers for the Queen were
called for and enthusiastic hurrahs rent
the air, with the soldiers waving their
helmets on the points of their bayonets.
The general public was excluded, but the
Queen especially invited the wives and'
children of officers now in South Africa. .
FIVE MESSAGES FROM
KRUGER AND STEYN
LONDON, March 10.â Several papers an
nounce that ' the Government on Tuesilay
received five messages from President
Krugrer and President Steyn in Dutch,
asking upon what terms a cessation of
hostilities could be brought about. The
messages surprised and delighted the .de
partment concerned. "While their tenor
was understood,. It was found' necessary
to summon persons thoroughly capable of
accurately interpreting the "messages, all
of which w ( ere filed- at. Bloemfonteln. v " : '"'
"Â¦ The Cabinet' convened on* Wednesday to
i consider | the messages; .and U'^ls believed
an uncompromising reply was sent," which
is -. known to, have reached: Bloemfontein
by the same means as the Boer cablegram
reached the -Government. The nature <of
the reply was such as to lead to a further
but gradual retirement of the Boer forces.
WILKINSON'S SUMMARY.
LONDON, March 11.â Spencer Wilkin
son summarized the situation in South
Africa for the . Associated Press at mid
night as follows:
."The fighting reported near Helpmaaker
Is probably only the result of a recon
noissance, and it seems to me to be pre
mature to assume that any movement In
large force is . in progress in that direc
tion. .
"General Buller. as soon as communi
cations are in order, will certainly- do
what he can to keep the Boer force In
Natal engaged, arid to â¢ prevent them all
from bflns used to reinforce the army re
sisting Lord Roberts. I expect ' Lord Rob
erts to. strike Bloemfonteln In a day' or
two. , As- to Mafeking. If it is not relieved
very soon, the place must fall. One there
fore hopes a brigade had been ' sent up
from Kimberley for, its relief within a day
or two of the evacuation of Magersfon
teln by the Boers.'' There has been time
for such a column to reach Mafeking by
road, but there is no' direct evidence of
its existence and the wish is father to the
thought."
BULLER AGAIN ON THE MOVE.
BOER HEADQUARTERS, BIGGARS
BERG, March 9.â Shots were exchanged
this morning near Helpmaakar with a
small body of British, who retired hastily.

HenUd. Copyright. l*"0. by the New Tork
Herald CtomyiEy.
LONDON, March v.â
Nothing more official has
come through from Lord
Roberts, but from other sources
I learn that the road to Bloem
fontein is really clear, as was first
intimated yesterday, and a march
of fifty miles will bring the Brit
ish front to the Free State cap
ital. According to a story re
ceived from Boer sources 12,000
British troops are threatening
the burghers in the neighbor
hood of Helprnakaar.
Usually when news is scarce
there is a plentiful crop of ru
mors, but yesterday there were
few of these, and logical London
ers were too much occupied by
the Queen's visit â or rather in
bidding her farewell on her re
turn to Windsor after her two
days' stay in the metropolis â to
heed any idle rumor or anything
less than authentic official news.
There was, however, one ru
mor which got afloat just after
the Queen left the city. That
was that hard-pressed Mafeking
had been relieved. That, of
course, caused something of. a
flutter, for reports of how the lit
tle garrison has been hotly and
indeed desperately bombarded by
the Boers during the past few
days have been received with ser
ious misgivings here. Military
wiseacres have shaken their
heads and expressed the opinion
that hotly bombarded Mafeking
could hardly hold out much
longer, and that without imme
diate relief Colonel Baden-Pow
ell's gallant little band must
either be destroyed or surrender.
Whatever hope was inspired by
the rumor soon fled when the
.War Office stated that there was
no foundation for the report that
Mafeking had been relieved.
With regard to Presidents
Kruger and Steyn's reported
overtures for peace I learn that
the Government does not con
sider that the time has yet come
for any authoritative statement

VICE PRESIDENT ROXA TYLER, OF CHICAGO, ILL.
Roxa Tyler, Vice President of the Illi-

praise of Peruna to restore .tired . nerves

"During the past year I gradually
lost flesh and strength until I was
unable to perform my work properly.

finally Peruna nas suggested to me.
It gave me new life and restored my
strength. I cannot speak too highly
of it" ".: t:^ v

Consumption is the natural termination
of all cases of neglected chronic oatarrh.
Every one who is afflicted with chronJo
catarrh Is liable to be attacked with coaÂ»
sumption at any time. In the first stage*
of the disease Peruna Is a sure curs; la
the later stages of the disease Peruna can
be relied upon to produce great benefit.

glophobia in a section in Paris this: week,
which affects to believe that war between
England and France forms a part/of- the
determined policy of Mr. Chamberlain and
the British imperialists, who Intend- . to
bring it about on the conclusion of peace
in South Africa. Much- of this anti-
Kngllsh campaign is a part of an under
hand reactionary propaganda againsrthe
Government and the republic. M. .'Yves
Guyot, in an article in La Slecle, 1 de
nounced this fostering by the anti-repub
lican press of the idea that war -with
England is inevitable. He stigmatized it
as the work of national treachery. Â¦Â¦Â¦'.-'. . Â¦

means a naval Sedan for France, -and
they count on overthrowing the republic

threw the empire.". . â¢ j - Â¦
The growing hatred between the two
countries is certainly a matter of anxiety
to the French Government, which- itself
does now and has always maintained a
most correct attitude toward England.
The correspondent of the Associated Press
here has talked with an official of- the
Government whose duty it Is to follow
France's foreign relations. He admitted
that the present state of public feeling on
both sides of the channel was becoming:
dangerous to the maintenance of amicable
relations. . Â¦ ; Â¦ . .Â¦; ;
. "This feeling," he said, "is mainly.cre
ated by the . provocative attitude of; the
English jingo press, which is so Unani
mous in its attacks upon France. that
they would' seem to come from- mot
d'ordre. Â¦ Public feeling in 1 almost every
country, including a considerable number
of -Americans, is against Great: Britain
in the Transvaal war, yet France alone is
singled out for thes attacks. There Is
no question pending between the . two
countries grave enough in -itself to Mead
to hostilities, but: if, the present mutual
feeling of. animosity continues I cannot
say what may happen. , The French.Gov
ernmont Is preparing for an. Â» emergency.
Our weak spot in case of war would \have
been the colonies, but when the measures
now being taken are completed they, will
be beyond the possibility of capture or in
vasion. Algeria and Tunis are, of course
out of the question, and the Government's
efforts are directed â¢ toward securing- /the
safety of the outlying colonies. 15 such as
Tonquin, Madagascar, the West African
settlements and the west Indian Islands.
Stores, ammunition , and improved arma
ments are being provided.", i : -*-; ..,. ' f \ ?$ Â».
Confirmation of these - preparations is
found In the published announcement of
the departure of stores for the colonies.

Conflagration- Reveals the

It Is Shown That in No Parisian

Coj>iTtghtÂ«d, 1900. by the Associated Press.
PARIS, March 10.â Paris, which has
been vainly yearning for a eensatlon,
found ample excitement in the destruction
of the Theatre Francais, which overshad
ows every other topic of Interest and has
afforded the newspapers material for
pages of absorbing reading. The disaster
brought to light the extraordinary fact
that there is no fire surveillance whatever
In Paris theaters; except during the time
of actual performances. Thus fire might
burn for hours during the daytime with
out any one being the wiser. â¢ Moreover,
neither the Iron stage curtain nor the au
tomatic extinguishing sprays in the ceil
ings were found to oe in working order.
The tardiness of the nre brigade and the
lack of water supply formed the subject
of inquiries in the Municipal Council, but
President Leplne denied both, declaring
the delay arose in reaching the high roof
of the building. This, however, does not
agree with the statements of eye wit
nesses.
Little damage Is noticeable from the out
side of the building, as the main .wall of
the theater, surrounded by galleries In
which are situated the offices and dress-
Ing rooms, is still standing. It is now
hoped that It will be possible to recon
struct'the interior without rebuilding this
wall. The Government is acting promptly
and has decided that the work of recon
struction shall proceed Immediately. For
this purpose a credit of 3,000,000 francs will
be asked. Â¦ â¢
It is â¢ expected that the Comedie Fran
eatse will be back again in its old home
before autumn. The r. will ; be
temporarily housed in the .Theatre Odeon,
the shrine of classical drama in the Latin
Quarter. -- . . ?
The difficulties in providing houses for
both the Comedie and Odeon troupes have
been solved by the spontaneous offer, of
the elder Coquelin, who came to. the res
cue and offered his playhouse, the Theatre,
de la Porte St. Martin, for one month free
of 'rent.'. This, offer was all :thei more /gen

CONTENTION OF DEMOCRATS
SUSTAINED IN COURT
LOriSVILT.E, Ky., March 10.-A decis
ion sustaining the contention of the
Democrats that the Legislature Is the
tribunal desipnatPd by the constitution
for the determination of contests for the
office of Governor and Lieutenant Gov
ernor was handed flown in the Circuit
Court this morninjr by Judge Fields. ThÂ»
Republicans trill appeal the cas*Â» to the
Btat<Â» Court of Appeal?, and 5f the decis
ion there if aprainst them, will try to get
a hearing before the United States Su
preme Court.
Jurtjre Fields reviews the history of the
cape and the pleading* of both sides, but
devotes mopt of his opinion to quotations
from court* of last tr^rt involving the
competency of the legislature finally to
decide similar disputes. He quotes the
reports of the contest boards, finding in
favor of the Democratic contestants for
Governor and I^iputpnarit Governor, and
cays that, while th* Legislature was dis
persed by militia before these reports
w*r* acted upon and was barred from its
usual sitting place, the record of the Gen
eral Assembly shows that the reports de
' daring Beckham Governor were adopted
by a quorum of each House of the Legis

DAROUX CONVICTED
OF POOL-SELLING
Will Now Attack the Validity of the
Ordinance In the Higher
Courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 10.â The first
victory in the legal, battle /against the
poolrooms was won this afternoon when
Frank Daroux was convicted of having
violated the terms of the ordinance re
cently passed by the Board of Trustees.
Daroux will appeal the case to the higher
courts, wherein he will attack the valid
ity of the measure. The evidence to-day
went to show that . after the passage of
the ordinance Daroux opened a poolroom
in Washington, directly across, the river,
with a branch in this city. He published
placards to the effect that no bets would
be made at this branch and that those
desiring to purchase pools would nave to
cross the river. But this claim was
shown by the evidence to.be merely a
subterfuge and bets were regularly made
at the branch establishment and pools
sold there. Since the practice Of pool
sellers here and elsewhere has been to
evade the law by some such scheme as
that adopted by Daroux. the decision of
Judge Anderson in finding Daroux guilty
is of Interest. Says Judge Anderson:
' "This - case presents a state of facts
showing conclusively that the .defendant
is attempting to evade ordinance 522 by a
show of not receiving bets at Sixth and J
streets. Here la an established place
called, a poolroom, -.where an expense of
$100. per. day Is admitted and yet; I am
asked to believe ,that there Is nothing in
violation- of. Â¦Â¦the Â¦ ordinance .going on.'
There Is t positive testimony of at least
two bets, with circumstances of many. A
court ; possessed of powers of reasoning
could not fall to, arrive at the conclusion
that defendant Is the owner of these pool
rooms, and that they are oonducted for
the sole purpose of evading ordinance 522.
Certainly -defendant would not incur an
expense of $100 per day for no return. In
fact the defendant's statement to the of
ficers, goes a long way to the establish
ment of his intent to violate the . ordi
nance. . '.:<--â¢
"In this case we have a direct showing
of a place called a poolroom. It is shown
to be directly connected with a place in
Yolo of similar sort, all under ona man
agement. The defendant's own statement
shows a direct evasion of the ordinance
of Sacramento. The law does not rec
ognise evasion and will' not allow courts,
particularly Inferior courts, to do It." .

How to Find Out if You
Need Swamp-Root.
It used. to be considered that only ur-
inary and bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning in the; disorder of
these" most important organi. . '
.The kidneys .filter and purify the
bioodâ that Is their work. â¢
* So. when your kidneys are weak or
out of order, you can understand, how
quickly your entire body Â¦is affected,
and how every organ seems to fall to
do its duty. Â¦/ i[; \ ~
If you- are sick or "feel badly," begin
taking the famous j new discovery,; Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help
all the other organs to health. A trial
will.convince;any one.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re-
sponsible for more sickness and Buffer-
ing, than any other disease, and if per-
mitted to continue fatal results are sure
to follow." Kidney trouble irritates the
nerves, makes you dizzy, restless,
sleepless and irritable. . Makes you pass
water often during the day and obliges
you to get lip many time* during the
night. Causes puffy or dark circles un-
der the eyee, rheumatism, gravel, - caÂ»
tarrh of the bladder, pain or dull ache
in the back, joints and muscles, makes
your head ache and back ache, causes
indigestion, stomach and liver trouble;
you get a Ballow, yellow complexion;
makes you feel as though you had heart
trouble; you may have plenty of ambi-
tion, but no strength; get weak'and
waste away. ..' ' '. : '*'Â£&Y;
The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, the world famous
kidney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root
you. afford natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect healer
and gentle aid to the kidneys that is
known to medical science.
If there is any doubt in your mind aa
to your condition, take from your urine
on rising about four ounces, place It in
a glass or bottle and let it stand
twenty-four hours. If, on examination,
it is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick
dust settling,' or if small particles float
about in it, your kidneys are in heed of
immediate attention. , > :
Swamp-Root Is pleasant to- take and
is used in the leading hospitals., recom-
mended, by 'Eklllfur.physiciaris in. their
private practice, and is taken : by doc-i
tors themselves who' have ' kidney ail-
ments 1 , because they, recognize in it the
greatest and most' successful J_ remedy
for kidney, liver and bladder troubles.
If . you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can

Awful Experience of an Indiana

PERU, Ind., March 10.â The four chil
dren of Arthur Williams, whose family
lived for four days in a submerged liut
on an island In the Wabash River, proba
bly will die as a result of their terrible
experience.
The sudden rise â¢in the Wabash River
some days ago during the night caused
the ice to open, and the only boat of the
family was crushed. . The family could not
cross to the shore, and for four days no
one heard their calls, for help. During
this time the river gradually rose, sub
merging the hut, and for three days tl>e
family was compelled to stand on chairs
and tables, and finally on the fourth day
and night clung to the narrow roof of
the shed to escape drowning. David
Crlpe and Shumann Hemlnger, neighbor
ing farmers, finally heard the cries and
after numerous attempts succeeded in res
cuing them.

PLOTTERS ARRESTED.
PARIS, March 10.â An investigation of
the plot in Rio de Janeiro to overthrow
the republic has disclosed the fact that
almost all the persons compromised have
been arrested. For a month past the
Government has known that the adver
saries of the present regime, who were
annoyed because of the financial excite
ment of the country, wished to create In
ternal differences and bring about the fall

ed a calm, vigilant attitude and de
termined to act at an opportune moment.
A police officer was detected receiving
money from the monarchists and distrib
uting It to various agents. Other persons
also received large sums.
The plan of the conspirators was a

BERLIN, March 10.-The action of the
Reichstag yesterday evening regarding
tne meat bill was eagerly commented
upon. The declarations of Prince Hohen
lohe and Count yon Posadowski-Wofcr.M
had the effect of discomfiting the Agra
nans. Some of the papers hitherto strong
ly in favor of the committee report, like
the Neuste Naehrichten. now say they
are unable to call the Reichstag action
w:*Â«. The National Zeitung rakes Count
I esadowskl-Wehner over the coals be
cause of his "shilly-shallying with the
Agrarians." instead of firmly declaring
the Government's intentions. It continues:
'Count yon Posadowski-Wehner's ibus
ir.g of these who tndeavor to re-establish
the Government bill and his defense ot the
Agrarians' insatiable greed Is character
istic, count yon Posadowski-Wehner on

opportunity to throw mud en us. The f.m
tisiios Count yon Pasodowski-Wehn-sr
uses to prove that the Americans have b>
far the largest interest in preserving cor
dial commercial relations with Germany
are untrustworthy."
Protrst meetings against the meat bill
continue. The Berlin Chamber of Com
merce has called a meeting for to-morrow,
at which representatives of all German In
tiustry and commerce will be present.
Prince yon Hohenlohe told the repre
sentative of the Associated Press that the
Bundesrath was willing to accept the law
excluding sausapes and canned meats. ,?x
cept where the Bundesrath specially per
mits their importation, relinquishing the
paragraph about domestic slaughtering,
but will not accept the fixing of a datÂ«
for the total exclusion of fresh meats.
Prince Hohenlohe also said that the
Pope had actually expressed a wish that
the Center should not create difficulties
for the German Government in connection
with the meat bill.
Will Consider the Naval Bill.
To a certain extent the naval bill de
rvencs upon the issue of the meat bill. The
Bundesrath will hold an extra session on
Monday to consider the question of rais'ny
the cost of the fleet increase. Herr Eufjciiv.
Kleiner's Freissinnige Zeitung demon
strates by official statistics that the re
ceipts of the rmpire are steadily dcclii.ing,
and that for 1539 the States fur
nished 5.000.000 marks to the empire to re
establish the equilibrium. Herr Richter
argues therewith that the whole of the
Government's calculations about the
naval bill's expenses arc erroneous and
that the costs of the fleet must be raisel
by taxes.
It is semi-offlcially given out by the
Imperial Department of the Interior that
the preparatory work for the projected
commercial treaties is far advanced. All
the negotiations with each country start
out from the German general tariff figure,
as in the case with Austrian coals and
RuPFian cereal?, but as the negotiations
propress the most important articles are
sinpkd out as the main objects;
Treaties Not Endangered.
From inside information it may be said
that the Imperial Government will never
accept paragraph 14 of the meat bill.
Therefore, it is not considered that thÂ«
commercial treaties with the United
Statf-s are endangered by yesterday even
ing's vote. There is no occasion for
Americans to get excited.

ment store bill, at which 10.000 people
were present, took place here last night,
and there have been similar meetings

TROUBLE IN SANTIAGO BAY
Rival Contenders for the Treasure
Found Aboard the Hulk of the
Sunken Gunboat
Furor.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 10.âRi
valry over the possession of a safe be
longing.to the sunken Spanish torpedo
gunboat Furor almost caused a second
naval battle yesterday. Cendoya, the
agent of the Ward line, with his Cuban
partners, has been engaged for several
months in wrecking the warships and has
performed considerable work, in dyna
miting the Furor, which work was diffi
cult on account of the depth of thÂ» wa
terâtwelve fathoms.
Recently he located a safe supposed to
contain $12,000 in Spanish gold and return
ed to find the buoy removed. He was
compelled to come to this city for a pilot
and returned to the wreck of the Furor,
where he found the American transport
Williams with a diver down. A rival diver
thereupon descended, and each of them
claimed he was the first to take posses
sion of the safe. A quarrel ensued, and
the transport's diver came up, alleging
that his rival had threatened him with
a knife. Cendoya's diver attached a line
to the safe, which he and his companions
claim the American officer took forcibly,
intimidating them with rifles from the
transport. Captain Parr says the line
failed -to raise the safe and that their
diver succeeded In attaching a line, which
secured the treasure.
â¢On board the Williams were Captain
Blunt, assistant quartermaster in charge
of the transport: Lieutenant Hamilton,
an engineer officer, and Superintendent
Fowler of the Barber Asphalt Company.
The American officers disclaim any finan
cial Interest in the expedition.
Captain Blunt says he allowed the di
vers and others to use the Williams be
cause, temporarily, she was not needed,
and during the quarrel stood on her deck
with a rifle, which, he says, was not load
ed. He disclaims any intention to use his
position, his uniform or arms to intimi
date the Cuban divers. Lieutenant Ham
ilton says he accompanied the expedition
as a spectator.
Safe Had Disappeared.
Both boats eventually returned to the
harbor and Cendoya. secured an order
from the court directing the police to take
possession of the safe. Fifteen armed
policemen on the tug Colon followed the
Williams, maneuvering: around the bay
for an hour. Finally the tug went along
side the Williams, and the police, with
drawn revolvers, prepared to board her.
when Captain Cooper, commanding the
Williams, confronted them with a rifle
and announced his intention to kill the
first man who/ stepped on board. He
claimed the civil, courts had no jurisdic
tion over Government ships. The police
thereupon retreated behind the pilot
house and the Colon returned to her
wharf.
Cendoya then reported the affair to De
partment Commander Whiteside, who or
dered Staff Adjutant Harford to investi
gate. Harford and some press represen
tatives searched the Williams at midnight
and no safe was found. Captain Blunt
and Captain Cooper disclaim any knowl
edge of the present whereabouts of the
safe, which Fowler says was thrown
overboard. Fowler declined to say
whether the coin had been removed. He
had a half Interest in the expedition and
says he is a partner of McGrail, a civil
employe of Captain Blunts office. Cen
doya is an American citizen and makes
serious charges against Captain Blunt,
which Commander Whiteside will investi
gate.
The Cubans resent the action of Captain
Cooper in refusing to accept the service
of legal process and they call the Wil
liams a pirate under the American flag.

OUEEN AROUSES WAR FERVOR
Her Visit to London Timed to Modify
the Effect of the Announcement
of the Enormous
Budget.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, March 10.â A week that
opened with a budget increasing the bur
den of the British taxpayer to an almost
unprecedented extent and ended with the
Queen stirring hundreds of thousands of
her subjects to enihusiastlc demonstra
tions of patriotism and war fervor can
scarcely be said to be barren of interest
ing circumstances. It would perhaps be
giving Lord Salisbury and his Cabinet too
much credit to say that the sudden
springing of the budget with its enormous
deficit and the quickly planned visit of the
Queen to London almost before the people
had time to realize how much the war
was costing them were part and parcel of
a masterly understanding of politics,
which, under the cloak of academic leth
argy, is keenly alive to every chance of
the moment. But whatever were the mo
tives prompting the Government's actions
â and the Queen never moves without con
sulting Lord Salisbury â they resulted most
favorably. No suspicion of .political pre
meditation has marred the heartiness of
the Queen's welcome, though the Irish
have not proved quite so Ingenuous in
commenting on her proposed visit to their
shores. Still, on the whole, the recent
actions of the Queen, her decision to re
main home, instead of going to Italy, her
projected trip to the Emerald Isle and her
generous recognition of the gallantry of
the Irish troops, combined with the vic
torious progress of Lord Roberts, have
once more put the United Kingdom on
excellent terms with itself.
Punch's Apt Cartoon.
This week's cartoon in Punch aptly Il
lustrates the feeling. It is an ill-drawn
lion with an uplifted paw, like a lump of
putty, coming out of a cave, with tierce
teeth bared and eyes glowering in the dl
rection of an animal which, resembling
nothing more than the well "known
human donkey of the American
stage, is labeled "continental press,"
ana is slinking off with a slouchy
gait before tne pugnacity of the
lion look. But no amount of poor draw-
Ing can kill the strength of the caption to
this curious picture, which reads "Who
said dead?" and that voices the spirit of
the nation to-day better than could col
umns of analytical review.
With the prospect of more serious over
tures for peace than those made this
week by the Boers, it is likely that the
feeling illustrated by Punch will Increase
and that the normal condition of self
confidence and might will shortly be
thoroughly re-established in Great Bri
tain, in spite of the terrible shaking up
that occurred before Lord Roberts took
the helm.
In the opinion of those best informed as
to Government opinions, the Boers Bre
likely to make a series of propositions
for peace, none of which will be feasible
for British consideration until the British
troops practically overrun the Transvaal
territory and only one card remains in
the republic's hands. Thus, while the re
cent and future negotiations are and will
be welcomed as most satisfactory signs
of British military progress, they are not
considered to Indicate that the end of the
war Is In sight. As an instance of this.
Lord Salisbury's reception of two long
cablegrams from President Kruger on
the subject of the terms did not delay for
an instant the preparations for sending
out large British re-enforcements and
supplies, either from England or from
lar-off Australia.
Salisbury Not to Retire.
However, the prophet of pessimism and
change is not stilled entirely. This week
has produced several articles in widely
read mediums in regard to the obligatory
retirement of Lord Salisbury from the
scene of active politics, and In the face of
these oft-repeated rumors a representa
tive of the Associated Press has made in
quiries and receives this statement from
one who. perhaps. Is closer to the Pre
mier than any. one else in England:
"These rumors of Lord Salisbury's poor
health, the breaking down of his intellect
under personal bereavement and his in
ability to concentrate his energies are
pure Inventions. He is in perfect health,
never worked harder and enters into
every situation with keen appreciation of
the slightest detail. I have never seen a
divorce of personality* from official capa
city so strikingly illustrated as It has been
by Lord Salisbury during the last few
months. I suppose that in due time some
one will have to succeed him, but he has
not mentioned this contingency, and from
the zest with which he goes about his
work one would scarcely think he consid
ered it. Personally I would be glad if
Lord Salisbury exhibited more fervor and
vim in his speeches in the House of Lords,
but I am happy to know that what the
world believes to be the lethargy and per
haps even the stolid stupidity of our Pre
mier is evidently due to the belief that the
country is sufficiently excited and stirred
up without his adding directly or indirect
ly any fuel to the fire. With this idea
dominating his actions and speeches he is
perfectly unmoved by the most caustic
satire of the organs of his own party.
With a mature judgment of English peo
ple and affairs of state he believes the
national crisis merits the sacrifice of any
appeal of party or popular sentiment. Any
one knowing the man thoroughly would
be slow to criticize such a determination."
Budget Gracefully Swallowed.
The Introduction of the budget has pro
duced a curious state of affairs, the Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach, becoming the butt of his
own party press and the subject of the
Opposition's encomiums. This is greatly
due to the fact that he followed the lines
of Gladstone's exchequer policy, relying
upon raising existing taxes rather than
the Introduction of new duties with which
to meet the war deficit. The abuse show
ered on him by the Times is particularly 1
strong.
The "Thunderer" has strenuously advo
cated a duty on sugar and several other
innovations, but the Chancellor of the Ex
chequer accepted none of them and paid
the penalty. In spite of thisâ and thanks
to the Queen and I,ord Robertsâ the bud
get has been swallowed gracefully, and
Lord Salisbury's Government is not likely
to suffer much at the next election
through Increased taxation. The price
secured for the war loan also helps the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, as it la not
too low to seriously disappoint the coun
try nor too high to cause a loss. The
llnancial operators bid it up to 102, thus
speculators will reap a nice premium of
3V?-
Then* was nothing heroic and little of
.nterest about' the budget except Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach's reference to the
Chicago millionaire. Smith, whose "state
paid Â£900.000 in death duties. This created i
almost more comment than anything con
tained in his speech, but since the lute
Mr. Smith's executors have written deny
ing'the statement that he had lived on U
shillings a day and pointing out that he
had given - during; his lifetime nearly a
million sterling to English charities, 'the
Chancellor of the Exchequer's reputation
for happiness in choosing illustrations has
somewhat suffered, while various papers
have questioned his good taste In thuÂ» re

REWARD FOR GALLANTRY.
Captain McCalla of the Navy to Be
Restored to His Former Place.
WASHINGTON, March 10.â The Secre
tary of the Navy has recommended to
the President that he exercise executive
clemency in the case of Captain Bowman
McCalla, who was reduced several num
bers on the navy list some years ago by
sentence of court-martial, and thus re
store him to the place he originally occu
pied. This action has been taken In view
of Captain McCalla's gallant and meri
torious services during tho Spanish war

all his classmates, who will be affected
by his restoration, that they would be
glad to see him restored. The offense for
which Captain McCalla was reduced Was
committed by him about eight years ago,
when in command of the Enterprise. He
struck a mutinous sailor with the flat of
his sword.

DANGEROUS JOKE.
Caused a Severe Nervous Shock to
John Riley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NICASIO, March 10.â As the result of a
practical joke John Riley, a blacksmith
of this place, Thursday received a nerv
ous shock which may have serious results.
A week ago Augusto Palestanyo, a
wealthy butter-maker, disappeared from
the Redding ranch, near here, and ever
since the whole neighborhood has been
searching high and low for hLs body, the
common Delief being he had met a violent
death. A dead calf was obtained and
dressed in a man's clothes was hung from
a tree in a wooded spot on a hill near
the town. The body of the animal at
tracted numerous buzzards to the place.
These caught Riley's attention and he
started to investigate, followed by a dele
gation of the jokers. When he reached
the spot and saw what was apparently
Palestanyo's body suspended from a
branch, Riley stood horrorstruck and was
unable to move from the spot. After
about ten minutes one of the jokers tried
to arouse him from the trance into which
he seemed to have fallen, but to no avail.
Finally he was led home by the men
who had assembled to enjoy the joke un
able to relax the muscles of his face from
their terrified stare. To-day Riley has al
most recovered from the shock and
swears vengeance on his tormentors when
he shall lay hands on them.

Owners against George Hannahs, and by
it it is sought to enforce the collection of

case. The orange and lemon growers
agreed to stand an assessment on their
property to raise the necessary funds,
when the assessment was made some
paid and some did not, and it is to enforce
the payment that the suit is brought to

ADVERTISEMENTS.
CHANCES OF
CANAL TREATY
VERY SLIGHT
General Impression Is That
the Amendment Will
Kill the Bill.
No Official Expression of Opinion Has
Seen Made in London, but There
Is a Strong Undercurrent
of Opposition.
Â«
LONDON, March 10.â No action ' has
been taken by the Government regarding
the change which has come over the Nic
aragua convention, as reported through
the lengthy cable dispatches, dealing with
the action of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee. The United States Government
apparently has made no representations
to Lord Salisbury since the convention
was signed and the affair seems unlikely
to be officially discussed until the final
Congressional action puts it in such shape
that it becomes a matter for diplomatic
consideration. Pending this, ofliclal opin
ion is reserved, and it is impossible to say
what action Great Britain is likely to
take regarding the Senate's amendment
to the treaty.
The Pall Mall Gazette comments on the
new situation as follows:
"The Foreign Relations Committee has
certainly gone far to wreck the Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, if only for this reason,
that powers other than the two most di
rectly concerned might refuse to acquiesce
in the modification, even if the British.
Government accepted It. A fresh start, it
may be, will have to be made after the
Presidential election."
WASHINGTON. March 10. â Lord
Pauncefote. the British Embas.sador, was
in conference with Secretary Hay for half
an hour at the State Department to-day.
The officials have nothing to say touching
the future of the pending Hay-Paunce
fote treaty. It Is plain, however, that the
action of the Senate committee in bring
ing in the amendment yesterday is re
garded by the officials as greatly endan
gering the life of the treaty. If the Sen
ate first adopts this amendment and then
ratiiles the treaty, a conclusion by no
moans certain in the official mind, it is
taid that the President will be obliged
to sign it, placing the responsibility upon
the Senate, and then leaving it to the
British Government to accept or reject.
The officiate believe that the British will
reject the treaty,' and in that case the
Ciayton-Bulwer treaty will prevail again.
Its force having been recognized. accord-
Ing to the officials, not only by the execu
tive branch of our Government in prepar
ing this pending treaty, but also by the
Senate of the United States, as evidenced
by the repart which accompanied the
treaty yesterday when it was presented
to the Senate.

the result of developments to-day, may
be allowed to take his seat in the House
as a Representative from Alabama,
Though the War Department has persist
ently denied that General Wheeler has re
signed. Adjutant General Corbin finally
admitted to-day that his resignation had
been received, having been referred to
him from the White House. This is the
text of the letter of resignation:
PANIQUI, Island of Luzon, Philippines,
November 26, 1599.
To the President, Executive Mansion. Wash
ingtonâSir: The insurgent government is vir
tually destroyed. Afrulnaldo is a fugitive In
the northern provinces: his Cabinet and Con
gress are scattered. The President of the
Filipino Congress is here, and from what he
says I think it will be impossible for thiÂ« Con
gress to ever reconvene. The various com
mands of the Insurgents' generals are reduced
to mere skeletons and fly before us so fast that
it is almost impossible to get within gun
range.
I therefore respectfully tender my resigna
tion as an officer In the volunteer forces of the
United States. Very respectfully,
JOSEPH WHEELER.
Brigadier, U. S. V.
Action upon General Wheeler's resigna
tion has not yet been taken by the de
partment. General Wheeler is under or
ders to come to Washington and submit
a report upon an inspection he made of
the island of Guam under orders given
him by the President before his depar
ture for Manila. Immediately upon his
arrival here his resignation will be ac
cepted.
President's Course Inexplicable.
Why the letter of resignation should
have been held at the White House for
such a long time after its receipt is a
matter of much comment among officers
acquainted with the Alabama fighter.
The news of General Wheeler's resigna
tion created some surprise in Congres
sional circles. The fact that it is dated
November 28 shows that it was the inten
tion of the Alabaman to resign his army
commission in order that he might take
his seat in the House. General Wheeler
has not been recognized, however, as a
member of the House. The place on the
Ways and Means Committee held vacant
for him was recently filled and the
Speaker has provided no committee as
signment for him. Upon his arrival here.
General Wheeler is expected to present
himself at the bar of the House, and, In
view of his evident intention to have re
signed his commission before Congress
convened, the House probably will per
mit him to take the oath. Representative
Bailey, in discussing General Wheeler's
case, said to-day:
"If General Wheeler resigned his com
mission before Congress met. or If it is
shown that his case is similar to- the
Schenck case, decided in the House dur
ing the Thirty-eighth Congress, I don't
think there will be any opposition to his
being seated."

FREUNDT CONFESSES.
Tells the Story of the Murder of
August Zaspel.
Special Dlfipatch to The Call.
SPOKAXB, Wash., March 10.â In his
coll in the county Jail to-day William
Freundt told with sickening details the
story of how he murdered August Zaspel
November 24 last; how he covered the
body of his victim with brush, went home
and later returned to drag the corpse half
a mile over rocks and through the woods
to the lonely spot where he buried it be
neath a heap of stones. Here it was
found several days later.
The confession was made in the pres
ence of the murderer's wife, the Sheriff
and prosecuting attorney and a newspa
per man. Freundt is a German and
speaks English indifferently. He betrayed
little feeling in making his recital. The
officers are frank to admit that -but for
the confession Freundt might have es
caped punishment, as the testimony
against him was entirely circumstantial
and meager. ZaFpel, his wife and three
children were neighbors to the Freundt
family of father, mother and one child.
The families quarreled.
A few days before the tragedy Freundt
lost $150 he had hidden In an outbuilding
and he suspected Zaspel of taking it. He
waylaid Zaspel and shot him through the
heart. When the body was found the
flesh from the back, shoulders and head
of the victim was frightfully torn, evi
dences of the manner which it had been
dragged there. Freundt is a butcher.
Until to-day he has stoutly maintained
his Innocence.
RICH COPPER ORB POUND.
A. J. Clark Discovers a Valuable
Ledge in Siskiyou.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ«U.
ETXA, March 10.â A. J. Clark of Etna
has Just returned from the Salmon River
country and brings back with him sam
ples of copper ore going 25 per cent in
copper. Discoveries, show the ledge to be
about twenty-five feet between the walls.
The adjacent country is well wooded
and watered and not far from the county
road. An expert from the United Verde
mine of Arizona pronounces the ore equal
to that of the Arizona mine. Assays of
the top rock show 7 per cent, and its
richness increases as it. goes down. This
is one of the best discoveries yet made
in Siskiyou County.

when repairs or alterations were being

stands adjacent to the parochial resi
dence and the rubbish accumulating
gradually covered the quaint old font. It
Is certain that the. font has not been
used for at least Â¦ fifty years, for the
house, the foundation of which covered
It, was built forty years ago and no re
pairs or improvements had been made
upon the church; for less than ten years
previous to that time.
Father Mestres, priest of San Carlos
parish, has examined the font very care
fully and all the facts â¢In parish history
in connection * therewith and he believes
it Â¦to be the font Â« used by the mission
padres, probably Padre Junipero Serra
himself, in giving baptism to the Indian
converts when the mission was first
founded. The relic is certainly very an
cient and I may possibly date back even
further than the founding of the mission
â1770. Father Mestres intends having theÂ»
font placed in the quaint old mission
church at . Carmel, near here, which al
ready contains s.o many interesting relics
of early mission days In California.

NO ANNUITY
FOR EX-QUEEN
LILIUOKALANI
Senate Tables the Amend
ment Pensioning the
Former Sovereign.
Would Set a Bad Precedent in View
of the Many Chiefs Being De
throned in the Phil-
â¢
WASHINGTON, March 10.â While ( the
Senate had the diplomatic and consular
appropriation bill under consideration to
day, a lively debate was precipitated by
an amendment offered by Hoar of Massa
chusetts, proposing to give former Queen
Liliuokalani of Hawaii $20,000 and an an
nuity of $10,000. The amendment was
tabled linally without division. The pend
ing bill was passed with a few minor
amendments. The remainder of the ses
sion was devoted to eulogies of the late
M. L. Hayward.
In explanation of the amendment. Hoar
said the former Queen was the proprietor
in her own right of much property that
had been lost to her by her dethrone
ment. He said that she had been the
subject of cruel calumnies which he was
assured had not the slightest foundation
in fact. He was satisfied her life had
been quite spotless.
Tillman of South Carolina Insisted that
if any obligation existed at all it was one
of Hawaii and not of the United States.
Platt of. Connecticut did not believe the
former Queen had the slightest claim on
the United States, and, while he would
be willing to join in the making of a
donation to her, under the circumstances
he would not agree to legislation that
recognized her right, to any such pay
ments.
Gallinger of New Hampshire denounced
the proposed appropriation as utterly un
justifiable.
Lodge of Massachusetts, while admit
ting that the former Queen had no claim
on the United States, said the proposition
made was simply as an act of grace.
Thurston of Nebraska suggested the
donation to the former Queen of a lump
sum. He strongly opposed putting her
on the pension rolls of the United States.
Would Set a Bad Precedent.
Cockrell of Missouri, in opposition to
the amendment, declared it was a dan
gerous precedent to establish at this
time.
"If we are to pension all the monarchs
dethroned from our islands," said he, "we
are likely to have our hands full. There
will be the Queen of Hawaii, the Queen
of the Sulus and the monarchs of many
other places. Headed by the Queen of
Hawaii with $10.(XX), the list will go down
to tbOOO for somebody else, then to $7000
and finally wind up with a pension of
$5000 for widows of Presidents of the
United States."
Mnrjjan â Will you Include the widow of
Aguinaliio? < Laughter.)
Cockrell â Why, of course; we"ll have to put
her in.
In conclusion Cockrell announced his op
position to the pensioning of any monarch
in any circumstances thus far developed.
Tillman contended that the amendment
was without equity. He thought if there
were any claim at all it should be paid by
the people of Hawaii.
McComas of Maryland also opposed the
amendment, taking the position that there
was no moral or legal obligation to pay
the proposed pension. He did not conceit
that Liliuokalani had been entitled to
continue in the office.
On motion of Carter of Montana the
amendment was laid on the table. The
bill was then passed.
Too Many Senate Clerks.
Allen of Nebraska introduced a resolu
tion directing the Committee on Rules to
report why the secretary of the Senate
had not for several years reported at the
beginning of each session the number of
clerks, messengers and other employes,
together with their salaries. In accordance
with a provision of the statutes. Alien
f-aid that the statement had not been
made for several years. An agreement
reached a number of years ago by Sen
ators had been violated, and the Senate
force had been rapidly increased until row
it numbered about 300 persons, drawing
aggregate salaries of $510,000. The resolu
tion was passed.
Thurston of Nebraska had passed a res
olution calling upon the Secretary of the
Interior to inform the Senate whether any
leases of lands in tbe Wind River Indian
reservation, in Wyoming, had been made.
The bill authorizing the Cuban commit
tee of the Senate to visit Cuba was taken
up and passed.
On motion of Carter the Senate agreed
to meet at 10 o'clock next Monday to con
tinue the reading of the Alaskan bill.
Thurston of Nebraska presented resolu
tions commemorative of the services of
the late Monroe L. Hayward, Senator
elect from Nebraska, lind delivered an
eulogy upon Mr. Hayward, as did Fair
banks, Spooner and Allen. As a "further
mark of respect the Senate, at 2:45 p. m.,
adjourned.

AN EMPIRE REJECTED.
AS a rule Eastern people are either so indifferent
or so antagonistic to all comprehensive
projects for the upbuilding of the West and
the improvement of the vast region on this side the
Missouri River that there is something quite note
worthy in the fact that the Boston Globe recently di
rected the attention of its readers to the foolish man
ner in which the arid and semi-arid sections of the
<:our.try have been neglected.
Taking as its text a statement of Professor Wal
lace of Edinburgh, that if the possession of the great
est area of neglected land be an evidence of national
greatness, then the United States may claim to be the
greatest nation in the world, the Globe points out
that while most Americans would hesitate to accept
such a doubtful compliment, the words of the Edin
burgh professor are none the less true. It then goes
on to say:
"The Secretary of the Interior in his annual report
is authority for the statement that among these un
appropriated lands there are 74,000,000 acres which
would be 'capable of sustaining and comfortably sup
porting, under a proper system of irrigation, a popu
lation of at least 50,000,000 people.' That is Mr.
Hitchcock's calculation. Yet year after year our peo
ple have suffered this potential empire to bake under
the cloudless sky and blazing sun of a great, voiceless
desert. Some of its soil may be bored for 400 feet
without finding a bowlder, and much of it is the rich
est alluvial deposit of the mountain floods, better
than any of the loani which our New England gar
deners jealously hoard. Nevertheless, there are re
gions where half a million acres of this rich earth
would not supply sufficient grass for one little burro.
But let there be an overflow from the river and the
grass will leap forth at the rate of twelve inches a
day until it attains maturity."
The improvement of that vast empire within the
confines of the Union is deliberately rejected by Con
gress. Liberal appropriations have been made for ths
improvement of small rivers and comparatively un
used harbors in the East, while a most niggard policy
has been pursued with respect to irrigation. Senator
Warren of Wyoming recently made, the assertion that
the sums appropriated by Congress in the last twenty
Last week it was reported that the exposition in
Paris would not be ready for the opening on the day
announced in the original programme, but now it is
said everything will be in good order and there will
be no delay. . Next week we shall probably get the
frst report repeated and then another contradiction
of it. Anything goes that advertises the show and
keeps the world interested in it.

A BIG TELEPHONE FIGHT.
OVER in the East the prospects of the year are
brightened for the patrons of telephone lines
by the organization of a powerful company to
fight the Bell monopoly and by competition bring
down telephone rates and at the san^e time improve
the service. As a substantial victory! for the new or
ganization in the East would undoubtedly result in
breaking down the monopoly here as well as there,
the contest is of almost as much interest to San Fran
cisco as to those cities where it is now being waged.
The Philadelphia North American, in giving an
account of the competing company, "the Telephone,
Telegraph and Cable Company of America," says it
is composed of some of the leading capitalists of
Philadelphia and New York, among whom are John
Jacob Astor, Daniel O'Day, Standard Oil Company,
H. R. Wilson, banker, New York; W. J. Latta, Phila
delphia; C. W. Morse, president of the American Ice
Company; Charles E. Adams, president of the Mas
sachusetts Board of Trade; H. E. Gawtry, president
of the Consolidated Gas Company of New York; W.
H. Gelshennen, president of the Garfield National
Bank, New York, and George Crocker of San Fran
cisco.
The combination, it will be seen, is a strong one,
and it appears a decided victory has been already ob
tained over the old monopoly. The Erie telephone
system, one of the largest branches of the Bell Com
pany, has been acquired by the new corporation. This
system is said to be subdivided into five divisions,
operating in North and South Dakota, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Arkansas, Texas and a portion
of Ohio. It has a capital of $22,000,000. and its ac
quirement adds immensely to the prestige of the rival
organization, while at the same time diminishing the
strength of the Bell Company.
Commenting upon the contest the North Ameri
can says: "From the conflict now raging between the
two corporations may come cheaper telephone rates
for Philadelphia. The Telegraph and Cable Company
has a capital of $30,000,000, and its promoters have
planned to carry the battle of competition against the
old company to every city 'or town where a tele
phone line is operated. They are known to be seek
ing a franchise in this city, and those who are familiar
with the situation predict their success."
From that report of the fight in the East we can
draw reason for the hope that before long the new
company will extend the field of its operations to
San Francisco and. force an improved service and
lower rates here. There is certainly a good oppor
tunity for the new corporation, since the monopoly
here has conducted its business in such a manner as
to incline the public to give a hearty welcome to any
new comer in the field.
â¢ In the meantime, however, it is to be noted that
rivalries between great corporations controlling pub
lic utilities generally end in compromises, by which
the rivals agree upon rates sufficiently high to enable
them to extort from the people sums as large as the
traffic will bear. For that reason it becomes more im
perative than ever to clothe the municipal authorities
with power to regulate telephone rates. If 'such
power be not vested in the municipality we may see
the rival companies united to. recoup from San Fran
cisco the sums they expend in fighting one another
elsewhere.
THE BUBONIC BOARD.
AFTER appearing in a continuous performance
of three days, in a scientific farce, which
proved to be a commercial tragedy to San
Francisco, the Bubonic Board of Health, relying on
the testimony of a rat, a monkey and a guinea-pig, left
the footlights, raised the quarantine of Chinatown and
left the city to recover, as best it can, from the wide
spread damage inflicted upon its trade and every
other material interest.
What a spectacle the incident presents! The Chief
of Police hurrying at midnight to rope in a quarter
of the city; the Bubonic Board adopting the
phraseology of grave emergency by bulletins that it
had "the situation well in hand," and in other terms
promoting the belief that it had identified the plague
and had given the pestilence a flying switch from the
glands of a Chinese into those of a guinea-pig; the
stolid indifference of the city government to the wel
fare and interests of the city; the inefficiency of the
quarantine maintained by the Chief of Police, which,
it is said, Chinese boast of escaping by the payment of
a dollar a head â all go to make a record of official
imbecility and worse that has not been equaled in the
history of the city. It is enough to make the guinea
pig grin.
The matter was one that called for wise action,
which would repress all alarm until the facts justified
measures that would warn the public of a real dan
ger. As Consul Ho Vow has pointed out, isolation of
the building in which the Chinese died, after a month's
illness, would have been sufficient until the history of
his case could have been known. The quarantine
would have then amounted to no more than that of
single houses, where our common contagious dis
eases, such as scarlet fever and diphtheria, may be
found. There is no doubt that the time between the
midnight fright of the nervous Chief of Police and
the daylight development of his light-headed action
would have sufficed to investigate the case of the dead
Chinese, and its prolonged history would have at
once removed all suspicion of the existence of bu
bonic plague, and the subsequent proceedings would
have never occurred. But, as that would have been
the sensible course to pursue, it was carefully avoided
by a lot of official people, who have no sense beyond
seeing a chance to gain vainglorious attention and
make themselves objects of interest.
The organ of this clan of self-seeking politicians did
its evil worst to back them up and spread a panic by
the issue of bubonic editions, filled with microbic hor
rors and feculent word paintings of the plague else
where, that were paraphrased from Richardson's "Old
St. Paul's" and other; sources that have their origin
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries' literature
of plague tragedies in Europe. In this way the Ex
aminer strove to justify and glorify the- fool zeal of
the small men who have the power to harm the repu
tation of a great city. It was in line with the dema
gogue threat said to have been uttered by the Chief of
Police, that if the quarrel of the tongs did not cease
he would banish the whole Mongol population from
Chinatown! He seems unaware that the Chinese are
here by virtue of treaty rights, and their treatment is a
matter of international concern. Notwithstanding the
evils of the presence of Chinese here, which no one
questions, their right to be here is settled by the treaty,
and they are not exactly deadheads, as far as con
tributing to the revenues of the country is concerned.
For the five months of October, November, Decem
ber, 1899, and January and February. 1900, the total
taxes collected at the San Francisco Custom-house
amounted to $2,816,700 65, of which the Chinese paid
$721,193 40. or about 25 per cent of the whole rev
enue, though the Chinese population is by no means
one-fourth of our total, being less than a tenth
thereof. As taxpayers and people with treat}' rights
they have a distinct legal status, which even as great
a man as the Chief of Police must respect. He might
as well threaten to close all the churches in San
Francisco because the bodies of two murdered women
were found in one. Follies and crimes have appeared
before in the administration of our city government,
but they pass into forgetfulness or are almost trans
formed into wisdom and virtue by the antic capers
of these witlings.
The great seal of the city should be changed to a
guinea-pig rampant, in the act of taking the Xescula
pian oath, and a Chinese couchant getting under the
quarantine ,rope by payment of one dollar.
years for the improvement of the Fox and Wisconsin
rivers would have sufficed to irrigate and â¢ redeem
i 00.000.000 acres of waste land.
On that issue the Globe points out that scientific
engineers have repeatedly reported that the best way
to guard against floods in such rivers as the Missis
sippi and the Missouri would be to draw away the
surplus waters at their sources, and store it up, if
need be, instead of trying to restrain the floods by
dykes and levees along the banks in the lowlands. It
then adds:
"It has been estimated that the loss occasioned by
the abnormal rise of the Missouri in one year repre
sented an amount of money equal to the cost of all the
hydrological basins needed in the far northwest, and
that if one-tenth of the money which has been ex
pended for the restraint of the Mississippi had been
expended at the mountain sources of the Western
rivers the farmers of the Mississippi bottom would
have been rescued from the peril of periodic floods,
while at the same time a vast desert on the plains
would have been rescued from its perennial drought.
But Congress has sent the money only where there
are constituencies, and these, abound in the Missis
sippi Valley, but are not to be found among . the
prairie. dog villages of the trans-Missouri wilderness."
It is gratifying to note that Eastern people are be
ginning to understand the importance of this ques
tion. We are spending millions in pursuit of the
vanity of imperialism in the Philippines and rejecting
a rich and noble empire within our own borders. We
are wasting money in wars which will yield no other
harvest than future wars, entailing further expendi
tures, while refusing appropriations for the improve
ment of our own lands and rendering them sources of
incalculable wealth.

IS THIS JOURNALISM?
WE have noted the omission by the Examiner of
Representative de Vries' name among the
four Democrats who voted for the Porto Rico
tariff. It seems that Mr. de Vries is under boycott in
si! matters where it is possible to omit his name or
mention of his work in the Examiner.
He recently introduced a joint resolution for repeal
of the duty on print paper and paper pulp, a subject
of great interest to all publishers. The Examiner
carefully cut his name out of its news received over
"the longest leased wire in the world."
lie also' introduced the joint resolution for Federal
purchase of the Calaveras big trees, and with great
industry 2nd address urged it through both houses
of Congress. The Examiner cut his name out of the
whole proceeding, except in noticing his presenta
tion of the successful resolution to the President for
signature, and claimed to itself the credit of the en
tire proceeding.
Such petty personal business would be discredit
able in any one, but when practiced by a pretended
newspaper it is a deliberate fraud on the reading pub
lic. Mr. de Vries is a Democrat, and, after the State.
his party is entitled to the credit or discredit of his
acts as its sole Representative from this coast. But
the Examiner by its boycott defrauds its readers, and
conceals from the public and its party, so far as its
act can do, all knowledge of what he does. So far as
that paper is concerned the seat which he fills with
commendable zeal and industry might as well be va
cant. The matter is beginning to attract wide atten
tion. A correspondent of the Stockton Independent,
referring to it, says: "I have no further use for the
Examiner. I want the news, and if a newspaper re
luses to give us information of our own Congressman
I believe every man in our district, whatever his
politics, should protest by declaring a boycott on the
Examiner as it has on De Vries."
The Independent says that if the paper and pulp
bill "had been presented by \V. J. Bryan, J. G. Ma
guire or James D. Phelan, we are quite sure the Ex
aminer would have displayed it under sensational
headlines, and the name of the author would have
been paraded in black type."
The Sacramento Bee calls it "a common specimen
of little journalism," and adds that: "Nothing has
been accomplished within the last five years in the
Â¦heavens above, the earth beneath, or the waters under
the earth, that the Examiner has not taken the credit
to itfelf. The Examiner refuses all mention of Mr.
<!e Vries as having introduced the resolution which
sftved the big trees, and says: 'The Examiner's ef
fort to save those national wonders, the giant trees
of California, has been successful.' The managers of
this paper have personal reasons for knowing that the
Examiner had about as much to do with the intro
duction of the paper trust measure by De Vries as
had the Sultan of Sulu or the Pope of the Greek
church. This mean, miserable and contemptible boy
cotting of the ablest Representative California has by
the Examiner furnishes additional proof of the im
measurable littleness of San Francisco journalism."
If the Bee would qualify its denunciation by limiting
it to Examiner journalism it would be. an irreproach
able characterization in its tight fit and perfectly
proper application to that boasting, braggart policy
which disgraces all journalism.

art, . and following the advice of Thackeray In his "Pictorial
Rhapsody," praises merit though It belongs to his dearest foe.
Withal, having a catholic taste, caring very much for pictures
exactly the opposite of his own, considering It an honor to call
himself a pupil of Puvis de Chavannes, who had a warm ad
miration for Melchers' work, and friendship for him person
ally, which he showed In a very touching way on the day
Melchers was gazetted a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor
giving him, with many expressions of affection, his own cross,
with its faded bit of ribbon, which he had received as a young
man from the hands of the Emperor Napoleon 111. Mr. Mel
chers is also a Knight of the Order of St. Michael of Bavaria.
He has had medals of honor In Paris, Berlin. Antwerp, Munich
and Amsterdam; in fact In nearly every capital of Europe.
Mr. Melchers was born In ISCO, in Detroit. Mich. The record
of his career Is almost monotonous, so uniformly successful
has It been. His father, being a sculptor, knew the advantage
of early training and sent him In his seventeenth year to Dus
seldorf. This town Is out of vogue as an art center now, and
the modern Parts-taught men smile at the tedious German
method of passing in slow degrees from the elementary class
to the life; but Mr. Melchers has nothing but praise for the
place and its professors, and perhaps much of his own pains
taking method was acquired there.
It is a sign of the man that he pursues his artistic way re
lentlessly. Without acquainting his father, whom ho feared
might too strenuously object, he left misseldorf In 1881 for
Paris and began his studies there In the ateliers of Boulanger
and Lefebvre, and also at the Beaux Arts. He made his debut
in the Salon of 1882 with "The Letter." At the International
Exhibition of 18S9 one of the two medals of honor given In thÂ»
American section of fine arts fell to Mr. Melchers for his ex
hibit of "The Sermon," "The Pilots" and "The Communion."
surely a very rare dlstlctlon for a man not yet 30.
CARI MELCHERS. the Detroit genius, . who came so
strongly Into 'public view through his decorations for
the now Congressional Library at "Washington, continues
to add to his fame as an artist. As usual, he is far better
known abroad than in his own country.
His largest picture, "The Supper at Emmaus," is at
tracting great attention among connoisseurs. The Christ,
sitting at the head of a rude table, breaking bread, severely
treated, of a tender, attenuated type, contrasts strongly with
the two disciplesâ one tall and muscular, the other stout and
grossâ brilliantly painted with much Impasto. their faces full
of awe and reverence, exemplifying the verses:
"And It came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave, to them.
"And th*>ir eyes were opened, and they knew him."
The color of the picture is brilliant. Intensified by vivid spots
of green and orange.
Mr. Melchers' first great essay in decoration was made for
the Chicago Exhibition. These decorations filled the corner
pavilion of the Liberal Arts building, and were the most mas
terly of any of the frescoes there. Unfortunately they have
perished by fire. His most important decorations were made
for the new Congressional Library at Washington. They are
very fine in color, following the rule of Puvls de Chavannes
that mural decoration should be low in relief and delicate lii
tone.
A peculiar and Interesting temperament. While at work
almost ascetic: unconscious of discomfort: content 'with the
merest necessities; ungregarlous. almost unsociable: preferring
not to talk about his work or show it. His friends, knowtne
his nature, allow for it, and, in return for the small amenities
of life, he gives themâ first his work, which is enough, and
then his honest conviction artisticallyâ he gives you the truth
"straight." He cares neither for friend nor foe in matters of
THE SUPPER AT EMMAUS. BY G4RI MELCHERS
From the Magazine of Art.
The British have come to the conclusion that the
Boers are demoralized, but the wish is evidently
father of the thought. Kruger's offer to make peace
on exactly the same terms he proposed before the
war began certainly shows no evidence of weakening.

Board. of Health Now Trying
to Redeem Itself Before
the Puhlio.
End of the Quarantine Fizzle Finally
Allows the Chinese to Resume
Business and Be Reason
ably Happy.
By special shortest leased wire from
Angel Island to San Francisco, a late bul
letin pronounces the monkey, guinea pig
and rats Inoculated with glandular poison
taken from the Chinese who, with the aid
of the Board of Health, caused so much
unnecessary trouble, as being in .good con
dition and thriving under tha new hypo
dermic treatment. .
The Board of Health has at last real
ized the error of Its ways and is now
engaged In redeeming Its sanity by an ac
tive Inspection of Chinatown. Three days
of quarantine brought to the minds of
the members of the Board of Health the
futility of attempting a game which they
tn their Inexperience bad not mastered.
The> hornets' nest about their ears caused
them to lift the burden in advance of the
allotted time set for the death, of . mon
key, guinea plÂ« and rats. . The Quarantine
was raised none too soon. Not only was
a great revenue shut oft from the Gov
ernment, but Inestimable inconvenience
was caused the traveling public, and
many large manufacturers employing Chi
nese for labor that white men would not
undertake. With the removal of the em
bargo the condition of things reached its
natural level and business in Chinatown
and at the Custom-house has resumed its
former status.
To glaze over their mistake, the Board
of Health in Its meeting Friday afternoon
passed a resolution calling for a sanitary
inspection of Chinatown. Yesterday
morning Drs. O'Brien. Chalmers, Fltzglb
bon. Secretary. Kelly and the entire corps
of sanitary inspectors pounced down upon
Chinatown and began their work. From
house to house the men moved, ordering
refuse to be destroyed and a general
clean-up. This will be done until the en
tire Mongolian district is given a bath.
If necessary, the bad places will be fumi
gated with formaldehyd.

WASHINGTON, March 10.â The cross
examination of Fred A. Martin, a miner,
was continued at the Coeur d' Alene in
vestigation before the House Committee
on Military Affairs to-day. He was close
ly questioned by Representatives Mondell
and Dick as to his presence on the train
which carried the riotous party to Ward
ner. He maintained that he was there by
chance and had no knowledge of or part
In the attack on the mill. He saw some
armed and masked men, but the serious
ness of the situation did not appear to
him until after the mill was blown up.
At one time, he said, an unknown man
pinned a ribbon on his coat, but there was
no explanation of its meaning. From a
distance he saw the explosions and after
ward saw one of the men (Shayne) lying
shot on the road. '*â_.., \ *
The cross-examination of Martin lasted
throughout the day. and was very rigid.
It led to frequent sharp controversies be
tween Representatives Lentz and Sulzer
on one hand and Representatives Hull,
Dick and Mondell on tho other, relative to
the lines of inquiry.
On redirect examination by Lenta the
witness said that in all about 1000 union
miners were taken from work In the
mines and put Into tha "bull pen. He
said the permit system, under which no
man was allowed to go to work unless he
held an official permit, was used to put
non-union men in the mines and to drive
union men out of the country. He said
that at one time, when he- sought a per
mit, he was told to apply to tho Governor,
600 miles away at Boise.

service In the Philippines, and' that said county
Is in a state of Insurrection. I am of the opin

be necessary, but smaller detachments should
be ordered In as rapidly as possible.

DISCUSSED THE CAUSE
AND CURE OF POVERTY
The regular monthly meeting of the
Elizabeth Cady Stariton Club waa held
last night at the residence of Mrs. Clara
Shortridge Foltz, 771 Halght street. ThÂ»
subject for discussion was "The Conquest
of Poverty," and a number of members
presented able arguments J regarding the
cause of poverty and its cure. Lew B.
Douglass held that while the conquest of
poverty implied riches, it really consisted
of happiness, and that many were more
wealthy in the possession of little than
the few who measured their riches by the
thousands. Dr. H. Darcy Power, Mrs.
Foltz, Mrs. Dorcas Spencer, Dr. A. Fra
zer and Dr. M. Barnes also took part in
the discussion, which proved highly inter
esting.
During thÂ« evening a paper by
Madge Morris; entitled "Shall Married
Women Hold Salaried Positions While
Single Women Need Employment?" was
read.

morning transferred from the crypt of the

When the cÂ«*iar box containing the metal
lic cafket was exposed to' view Jt was
found to be In a state of decay, and in a

that ceremony being postponed until the
remains are placed in their final restir;*
place upon th<Â» completion of the new

Morrison reports that nineteen expeditions'
have left Dawson for Cape Nome since
December 6, and as soon as the weather
moderates many more will start. The
population of Dawson is 6000 less than last
year. Late news from Nome confirms the
reports of the richness of the district and
announces new' finds in the interior, but

in winter. Typhoid fever has appeared
with increasing mortality.
In Dawson the revenue from liquor per
mitÃ for the year is placed at $100,000. Sa
loon licenses are worth $2500 per annum.
Prices are still up. The profits on drugs
are placed at 300 per cent, groceries at 2'K)
per cent, hardware 400 per cent. Beer 1Â«
worth $100 a barrel and whisky $40 to $60
per gallon. Owing to the Hooding of the

$30,000,000 will comprise the output for the
Dawson district.

PROMPT ACTION
IS DESIRED ON
FRENCH TREATY
Wished That It Become a
Law Before Congress
Adjourns.
This Would Give American Exhibit
ors an Opportunity to Receive
Return Benefits From Dis
plays at Exposition.
â â¢ â
Â¦WASHINGTON, March 10.â While the
State Department has not finally arranged
with the French Government for an ex
tension of the time allowed for the rati
fication of the pending French reciprocity
treaty, it is said at the department that
there is no doubt that such an arrange
ment can be effected.
Regarding the probable length of the ex
tension, it may be stated that although
willing to yield to the pressure of more
urgent legislative business in the Senate
the administration is particularly anxious
to secure action upon the treaty brfore
the expiration of the present session of
Congress. The principal reason for urg
ing j-uch action is a desire to secure to tho
American exhibitors at the approaching
Paris Exposition some substantial trad<>
benefits in return for the large amount of
money which Is to be invested in that en
terprise by the United States Government
and the exhibitors themselves. The de
partment officials will also urge upon the
Senate that the ratification of the treaty
during the present session will place in
their hands a powerful weapon with which
to meet the dangerous aggressions of the
German Reichstag upon American com
merce, as evidenced in the action tak*.n la
that body on the meat inspection bill.
Our Government has as yet taken no
cognizance officially of the progress of the
meat bill in the German legislative branch,
and it has been, of course, impossible for
the officials privately to Ignore the fact
that the Agrarian element has defentefi
the German executive as it stands and
that the meat bill had been adopted in the
most offensive form from our standpoint.
Therefore the officials have already been
considering what steps should be taken tj
protect our interests in the event that the
measure is finally approved In Its present
form by the Bundesrath and bo become
the law of Germany.
While there is ample authority in tho
statute books for the most severe retali
ation, it may be stated that the official
m!nd is disposed to seek still another
measure of power, and there is now In
contemplation the recommendation of leg
islation which will impose a heavy dis
criminating tax upon the shipping of any
country that unjustly discriminates
against American products.

SUCCESS OF KOBBE
IN SOUTHERN LUZON
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
SORSOGON, Southern Luzon, January
20.â Two days ago a military expedition
of some 2500 American troops, under Gen
eral Kobbe, left Manila and proceeded
on several steamships to the southern
end of Luzon Island, there to occupy and
permanently garrison six seacoast towns
and villages. Up to the present time
three such towns have come under the
American flag and the control of Ameri
can army officers and no one has been
hurt on either side. Two or three more
places remain to be garrisoned down here
and then the expedition will proceed to
Samara and Leyto, there to occupy and
hold the principal towns of these neigh
boring islands. .
General Kobbe's command is composed
of the Forty-third and Forty-seventh
United States Volunteer Infantry and
Captain Randolph's Battery of the Third
Artillery. These troops were loaded upon
the transports Hancock and Garonne and
the local steamers Venus, Aerolus, Sal
vadora and Castellano. Convoyed by the
gunboat Nashville, the expedition left
Manila on January 18 and slowly steamed
down the coast to the entrance of the
deep bay that leads from the sea up to
the town of Sorsogon, near the southern
extremity of Luzon. On the morning of
January 20 we met the gunboat Helena
and the little Maraveles. The three war
ships leading the transports in single file,
the whole expedition slowly proceeded up
Sorsogon Bay. -
There has followed us from Manila a
sldewheel steamer called the Nunez, with
a serviceable draft of six feet. Her use
and value now became apparent. Two
companies of the Korty-seventh were
loaded into eight of the Hancock's pull
boats and two more companies passed
aboard the Nunez. Then the Nunez tow
ed the whole outfit toward Sorsogon, still
eight miles up the bay.
White Flags Flying.
After an hour and a half the small
boats arrived oft Sorsogon and we saw
the town was decorated with white and
American flags. The Helena, the Nash
ville and the Maraveles had preceded the
Nunez and her boats to Sorsogon and
were anchored In front of the town.
General Kobbe and Captain Darlel, Col
onel Howe of the Forty-seventh, Captain
Bradley of the Hancock and Lieutenant
Kobbe, the general's son, were on board
the Maraveles. This gunboat steamed
close to the wharf In front of the stone
warehouses along the water front, and a
pull-boat set the party on shore. They
were met by a number of natives and
Spaniards, while crowds of the villagers
stood and gaped in wonder and curiosity

ONLY A SUGGESTION,
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense would suggest that If
one wishes to become fleshy and plump
it can only result from the food we eat
and digest and that food should be al-
buminous or flesh forming food, like
eggs, beefsteak and cereals; in other
words the kinds of food that make flesh
are the foods which form the greater
part of our daily bills of fare.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork, does
not properly digest and assimilate it,
which is the reason so many people re-
main thin and under weight: the diges-
tive organs do not completely digest the
flesh forming beefsteak and eggs and
similar wholesome food.
There are thousands of such who are
really confirmed dyspeptics, although
they may have no particular pain or in-
convenience from their stomachs.,
If 6uch persons would . lay their preju-
dices aside and make a regular practice
of taking, after each meal, one or two
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the . food
would be quickly and thoroughly digest-
ed, because these tablets contain the nat-
ural peptones and diastase which every
weak stomach lacks, and by supplying
this want the stomach is soon enabled to
regain its natural tone and vigor.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest every
form of flesh-forming food, meat, eggs,
bread and potatoes, and this is the rea-
son they so quickly build up, strengthen
and invigorate thin, dyspeptic men,
women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
delicate, use them with marked benefit
as they contain no strong, j irritating
drugs, no cathartic nor any harmful in-
gredient.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the most
successful and most widely known of any
remedy for stomach troubles because they
are the most reasonable and scientific of
modern medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold by
every druggist in tho United States and
Canada as well as in Great Britain, at 50
cents for complete treatment.
Nothing further Is required to cure any
stomach trouble or to make thin, nerv-
ous, dyspeptic people strong, plump and
Â¦well. '-.- ":Â¦-

CLOAK AND SUIT ANNOUNCEMENT!
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY^ MARCH 1 1, 1900.
It was their first sight of Americans.
Only three days ago the Tagalo leaders
had convincingly told them that Agul
naldo had ; driven us Â¦ out of - Manila and
held us prisoners upon vessels in Manila
Bay. The Spaniards told General Kobbe
that the insurgent forces had evacuated
the town. that morning, whereupon Col
onel Howe, with an American flag under
his arm and accompanied by an orderly,
walked rapidly across the square in front
of the church and raised the flag upon a
pole facing a building that had the ap
pearance of a barracks.
The soldiers from the Nunez were land
ed on the wharf and marched up into
town. The people seemed indifferent to
our presence, their only visible charac
teristic being curiosity. All day long, they
looked at the Americans from street cor
ners, doorways and second-story windows
and several times crowds of ; the curious
had to be dispersed from In front of
Colonel Howe's headquarters.
Suffered From the Blockade.
There were several Spaniards in town
and from them was learned something
of the recent happenings on shore. Sor
sogon Is an important shipping port and
a district capital. It has, like th*Â» rest
of this coast and the islands of Samar
and Leyte, been blockaded by our ves
sels since' August last and consequently
its people have suffered from the lack of
varieties of food. They seemed to have
had sufficient rice, fish and bananas,
which- is the diet of the poorer classes,
but all such comestibles as come from
Manila had long since been exhausted.
The Spaniards said they were very glad
to see us and they hoped for the fin
mediate re-establishment of commercial
relations with Manila. It seems there
had been stationed in Sorsogon about 300
Tagalo soldiers, under the command of
Colonel Leon Paras. There ,were only
one hundred rifles In the command, how
ever, and wo were told they had littlo
ammunition.
The Spaniards had been uniformly well
treated by the Filipinos and there had
been no official Imposition or Injustice.
The Spaniards were allowed every liberty
end they averred that travel In the coun
try had been safe at all times. The town
and the province had been ruled by the
Tagalo leaders and such civil forces as
they established were directly under the
control of the military and acted for
them. There have never been any Span
ish prisoners in the province of SonogSn
and all Spanish friars and priests were
driven away more than a year ago. The
churches are now occupied and services
conducted by the native clergy.
The natives of Southern Luzon are
called Vicols. They seem to be a quiet
and peaceful people, unlikely to give
trouble if Tagalo influence be removed
from them, and they are apparently more
anxious to be let alone to grow small
crops than to fight and die for the Agu
inaldo ideal of liberty. This province is
a hemp producer and as there have been
no shipments out for six months past
considerable of this product Is stored here
awaiting transfer to a market.
It appears that the main body of fhe
Filipinos retreated toward a village called
Castillo, some eight miles distant, but a
rear guard of twenty men was left In
Sorsogon and quitted the outskirts of the
town only when General Kobbe's party
landed on the wharf.

GREAT DANGERS
IN THE ADVENT
OF IMPERIALISM
Professor Wheeler's Address
Before the Monticello
Club.
Says That in Spain's Idea of Colonial
Government Lies the Lesson
of This Nation's Present
Peril.
The members of the Montlcello Demo
cratic Club listened to an able address by
Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler last
night at Native Sons' Hall on the subject
entitled "The Threatened Evils of Impe
rialism." The Berkeley president handled
the proposition in his usual masterful way
and held the close attention of a large
audience for over an hour. Professor
Wheeler was introduced by Dr. A. A.
d'Ancona In a brief complimentary speech,
and the learned educator at once launched
into the consideration of the tremendous
emergency which now confronts the na
tion In the threatened advent of impe
rialism.
"In the exercise of free government."
said Professor Wheeler, "we have come to
a decided turning point in our history,
largely from circumstances that Â¦ are the
direct result. of the Spanish war. In the
tendencies of thi^ nineteenth Century to
ward co-operation and consolidation by
means of the "steamboat, railroad, tele
graph and' telephone 'we are menaced, to
day with the great dangers arising out
of those very Important factors in ths up
building of a nation.
"One of the grave questions involved is
that of party organization and leadership,
and another Is the tendency toward the
extension bf national sovereignty through
the natural growth of commercial inter
ests. This problem concerns the attitude
of the English in South Africa and that
of this country in the Philippines.
"What is 'imperialism-? The word has
been used freely and rather loosely. AYe
may agree, however, in g-er.eral that, im
perialism is the opposite of what we mean
by free government. I have always be
lieved 1 that the safest exponent of 'free
government was Thomas Jefferson.' All
Â¦ statesmen arfe agreed in the acceptance cf
! the fundamental ideas of free government,
which imply that all people living under a
government shall be made responsible,
and the Issues be so distributed that sec
tions shall take cognizance of the issues
involved tn other sections. Free govern
ment indicates itself not on a basib of
economy, but solely on an educational
basis. Give the people a chance to exer
cise its wllU and it will assume the re
sponsibility.- -i
"Against this free, government stands
the other idea of imperialism or a gov
ernment from without, proceeding accord
ing to lines that take, no account of the
choices or Interests of those governed.
.Imperialism is not to be mixed up with
the idea of one-man power. Imperialism
and despotism are alike, but the very idea
of democracy calls for the largest'exer
cise of one-man power. Imperialism must
In nowise be confused with extension of
territory. They are different Ideas.
"When. you take away distributive gov
j ernment. whereby localities may take
I cognizance of things that concern them

the winners of last season's league pen
nant, and are hrld to compose one of the
strongest teams In the league.
when the people begin to feel that the
government is not its own, look out for
the rocks. Whether free government
will suffer and imperialism arise depends
upon the way this nation proceeds to or
ganize the government in the new Terri
tories.
"Spain wrecked itself by reason of its
lust for empire, which dominated its en
tire career and lowered -the plane of all
who were subject to It. In that idea of
colonial government is the lesson of our
danger. If Â¦ any territory shall be at
tached to this nation according to an ar
bitrary bond forced out of the natural
course of Its history, that will be imperial-
Ism. Its worst form is that which im
poses subjection arbitrarily. If we get up
a government over the Philippines which
admits of the exploitation of those islands
in the form of directing their trade to this
country and shutting them out from other
countries and thrust them into the jaws
of the politician, that will be imperialism.
The power of the irresponsible political
boss Is the worst Imperialism that I
know of."

OUT AT STOW LAKE
The members of the San Francisco Fly
Casting Club had almost a perfect after
noon for their third contest of the. season
yesterday, with the exception of a head-
wind that at times Interfered with the
long distance casting.
For accuracy and delicacy the day
could not have been better and the work
in those events was good throughout.
Harry Golcher distanced by many feet
his nearest competitor, extending his line
115 feet in the long distance event.
Mocker was second with 9S feet and Reed
third with 91 feet.
In the three events which followed W.
D. Mansfield carried off the honors, mak
ing S5 S-12 per cent in accuracy, 86 S-12 per
cent In delicacy and 82 4-5 per cent in
the lure casting event.
As weather conditions will probably be
favorable to-day there will, no doubt, be
a large attendance at the lake. The first
event will begin soon after 10 o'clock, and
several hours will be consumed in com
pleting the programme.
Following' are the scores in detail:

DENSE BAY FOG
MAKES TROUBLE
FOR SHIPPING
Sausalito and Tiburoh Ferry
Steamers Have Narrow
Escapes. f
Captain Henry Nichols' Remains
Landed From the Solace â Trans
ports Warren and Missouri
to Be Overhauled.
The first of the March fogs put in It 3
appearance on the bay \ this morning.
About 7 a. m. it was very thick and many
of the ferryboats were from fifteen min
utes to a half-hour late in making a land
ing. At one time the steam whaler Will
iam Baylies, German bark Paul Isenberg
and British ships General Gordan and
Cromdale, the ferry steamers Sausallto
and Tiburon and the tug Sea Queen low-
Ing the bark Ferris S. Thompson, were
all in a general mix-up. The ferryboats
and the tug were dodging in and out
among the outward-bound fleet for half
an hour. Finally the tangle seemed to be
straightened out,, and the. Sausalito was
going full speed ahead for her slip when
the- tug and her tow loomed up.
All Is well that ends well, and way wn.3
stopped on both vessels in time to avert a
collision.
The steamer Berkeley while making her
Blip missed her landing owing to the fujf
and crashed into the dolphin. The dam
age was very slight.
About 10 a. m. the fog lifted, but only
to settle down ascaln about noon.* All the
transports at anchor in the bayiwero run
ning their launches, while -the Philadel
phia and Marion had their boats in com
mission. When the fog set down a<?ain
every one of them was in the bay, ' ithei
bound for the shore or making for the
transports. Finally, after a succession of
whistling from the launches and rinÃin*
of bells on the transports, the launches
made their landings and all was well.
The Folsom-street landing was the
busiest spot on the front yesterday. The
launches from the Philadelphia/Hancock,
Warren, Logan and McCulloch were com
ing and going all day. while Peterson'*
launches were in and out of the slip every
five minutes. Men on all the vessels named
except the Philadelphia had shore liberty,
and the saloons along East street did a.
big business In consequence.
The Philadelphia sails this morning for
Central America.
The remains/)! Captain Henry Nichols,
late of the Monadnock, came ashore from
the naval transport Solace yesterday.
From Folsom-street wharf they were
taken to the ferry and from there to Oak
land the late home of the d?ad officer.
Colonel Bird, who is expected her.> on
the next China steamer, will thoroughly
Inspect the transport Logan on his arrival.
He has already overhauled the Warren,
and It is expected that, according to niÂ«
recommendation, fully $100,000 will be
Epent In putting that vessel in first-class
order. What the repairs to the Logan
will cost will rot be known until after
Colonel Bird's inspection. The overhaul
ing of the hospital ship Missouri is going
to coet a lot of money. The vessel's ma
chinery and equipment are In a bad shape,
end It is said that. the necessary repairs
will cost $250,000.
The Hancock's launch is still at the bot
tom of the bay. Thursday the divers
thought they had located It, but whon
they went down all they found was a pile
of rock. The chances are that the launch
is by now somewhere in the vicinity ol
Alcatraz Island. v '
The steam schooner Tillamook had a
very rough trip down the coast from Tilla
mook. She was a hundred hours making
the run, and during the southwester lost
her bulwarks and part of the deck load

steamer Point Arena and the brig Pitcslrn
were submitted to Chief Wharfinger Percy

sworn out by Miss M. E. Rouch, 305 Lar

obtaining money by false pretenses, j Miss
Rouch claims that last November Jens,
by representing to her that the Meade
gold mine of Calaveras County was a pay
ing proposition, induced her to invest $500
in' the stock of the mining compay. She
says that she has since learned that In
stead of paying 40 per cent dividends, as
ehe was lead to believe, the mine is prac
tically worthless, and she ventures the
same opinion in regard to Jens.f
Jens later was brought to' the City
Prison and 'soon after released -on $350

to buy the mining stock, but claims the
mine is all he represented It to be, and
that the company's books show that Miss
Rouch receipted for dividends paid her
since hor investment.

The Bohemian's Founders
Meet Around the Table
for Annual Dinner.
Evening: of Delightful Reminiscences.
Messages From Absent Mem
bers â Greetings in Verse
From Stoddard.
The founders of tho Bohemian Club save
their anniversary dinner in the redroom
of the club last evening. J. N. H. Irwin,
one of the two living charter members,
presided at the banquet. Raphael Welll
acceptably performed the duties of chief
adviser to the chef. The large round table
was beautifully decorated with almond
and plum blossoms.
The attendants were: A. G. Hawes. Dr.
Behr, I. Gutte, Henry Marshall, Jasper
McDonald, David Bush, John L. Beard,
John Landers, Dr. Benjamin Swan, Wal
ter Turnbull, George Wright, H. R. Bloom
er, General" John Hew6ton, H..M. Bos
worth, Samuel D. Mayer, Sidney M. Smith,
Reuben H. Lloyd, Stewart Menzles, Ra
phael vWeill, George T. Bromley. Arpad
Haraszthy, Hugh M.- Burke and Joseph
N. H. Irwin.
Much of the delightful talk of the even
ing was reminiscent of the Sacramento
street stage of the club's career. Mr. Ir
win traced the steps of the organization
from the first committee meeting of news
paper men until the signing of the char
ter. Every member present made a lit
tle speech.
Letters were read from United States
Senator George C. Perkins, Washington,
D. C; Jennings S. Cox and Raoul Mar
tinez of New York; George W. Phelpa,
Tucson, Arizona; A. McFarland Davis,
Boston. Mass. Poems of Daniel O'Connell
were read, and songs of Joseph Maguire
were sung.
Charles Warren Stoddard sent his greet
ings in verse, and among the lines were
these, prefaced by the text "Not that I
love Caesar less, but th&t I love Rome
more."
Happy thÂ» .heart that in !ta youth
Was festered la a field bo fair;
That lived and loved in very truth
Without one care.
Would I were youn* araln to play
The cub amen; the lion* there;
To have once more a holiday.
Then seek my lair. .
Then eeek my well-beloved lair
And lay mÂ« down In peace to sleep, ,
Praying God who holds us in His care

Mock Trial at the Cosmos
Furnishes Fun at Novel
High Jinks.
Alec Vogelsang and Judge Hebbard
Preside and a Batch of Attor
neys "Work for Their
Clients.
Â»
The Cosmos Club, on the corner of But
ter and Octavia streets, was turned Into
a courthouse last night for a Jlnke. the
leading feature of which was a mock trial
conducted after the fashion of an obsolete
procedure.
Sitting under a dais of royal blue were
Alec Vogelsang and Judge Hebb&rd,
JJuges of the assize term. They were
properly dressed In ermine, and wig, as
suming an icy dignity that sometimes
gave way in warm outbursts of geniality
whenever the cuj? or cigars were passed.
Y. B. IX Mills was the hieh sheriff,
'Billy tstlnson serving under him. Criers
ami stenographers and a jury of varied
nationality completed the court. John
inllcr, James l^anghorn, Harry P. Di
mond and Henry Eickoff were the attor
neys.
After a dinner, which satlsflsd. both
stomach and soul, the court opened for
regular business. Ex-parte motions were
iioani and some applications for citizen
ship listened to by the rare judges on the
bench. Larry Harris, metamorphosed into
an Irishman just landed, applied for nat
uralization papers. . The questions asked
him were of the knotty, tangling kind ne
cessitating a knowledge of the tenderloin.
Harris stuttered and stammered until,
when the judges were about to deny his
prayor, he produced an order written by.
Joseph Tobin to Mayor Phelan. requesting
the latter to put his friend on the force.
The order was written at the Ingleside
track. The judges passed Harris, who
forthwith became an officer of the law.
Charles Bresse in Chinese garb and
Â¦ maKe-up proved to the satisfaction of the
â¢ court that he was not the plague-stricken
'â¢' Chinese; in other words, he was not a.
dead one, and the embargo of abstinence
was removed immediately. Fred Siebe.
who was swathed in a woman's clothes,
was arrested and brought to court on a
fharge of vagrancy. The questions asked
and answerer! were of peculiar Interest.
The case on the calendar for which tha
1* pal talent was assembled was the prose
- eution of William B. Bradford for killing:
Rairie by trap and snare out of season. So
much time was consumed in the prelim
inary caseÃ that the court, which declared
â¢ Itself thirsty, adjourned till 2 a. m. next
â¢ week.
Harry P. Dimord was the sire of the
f jinks, which was a success In every par
ticular.

Vallejo's Gambling Law.
The Supreme Court has refused to in
terfere in the sentence imposed upon T.
J. Murphy of Vallejo, who was convicted
of conducting a keno game in violation
of an ordinance which prohibits gambling
games of all kinds. The , petition for , a
writ of habeas corpus was based upon
one point principally, that the game of
keno is not mentioned in the code as a
gambling game and that the ordinance
was invalid because its provisions ex
ceeded those of the State law. The Su
preme Court took the position In remand
ing Murphy that the city has a right to
prohibit all games if it so desires.
SHOEING THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT HORSES
Question Again Discussed and Taken
Under Advisement â Vacations
for the Firemen.
The Fire Commissioners at their meet
ing yesterday morning again listened to
the . views of members of the Master
Horseshoers* Association in the matter of
shoeing- the department horses.
J. O'Rourke, John McCarthy and E. B.
Carr urged that the work should bo dis
tributed among the different shops in the
city, so as to give every one an equal
share. The prices would be the same and
there would be a considerable saving of
time, as it would not be compulsory to
take the horses from all parts of the city
to one place, as had been the custom for
the past twelve years.
E. M. Graney, who has for years done
the work, opposed its distribution, and ar
gued that where one man did it the re
sponsibility was on his shoulders, but if it
was divided there would be no one to hold
responsible. The matter was taken under
advisement, "but the Commissioner*
seemed to lean to the proposition to dis
tribute the work.
It was agreed to give the firemen two
days' vacation each month besides the
usual annual vacation of not more than
ten and not les than five days, which was
in accordance with the State law.
The resignation of D. H. Wright of
truck 8 was accepted, and Charles M.v
gulre was appointed to fill the vacancy.
The following committees were appoint

KNOCKED DOWN BY
A RUNAWAY TEAM
Matthew Dacey, an Old Laborer, Seri
ously Injured While Crossing
Sixth Street.
Matthew Dacey, a laborer 65 years of
age, met with an accident yesterday
afternoon that owing to his advanced ago
may have a fatal result.
He was crossing Sixth . street^ between
Howard and Tehama streets, when he
was knocked down by a runaway team
and dragged along for some distance. He
was picked up and sent to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon, wliere it
was found that both legs were fractured
and he was suffering from the shock to
his system. He lives with his sister, Mrs.
Callaghan, on Vallejo street, between
Hyde and Larkln.
The team belonged to Georgr* Vincent,
an expressman, whose stand is on the
southeast corner of Howard and Sixth
streets. Something 1 frightened the team
and they bolted south on Sixth street. The
old man was unconscious of danger till
just before the team reached him, an'l
then It was too late to get out of the way.

SHOTGUNS FOR
THE GUARDS AT
THE PRESIDIO
Colonel Eskridge Determined
to Stop the Escape of *
Prisoners.
Twenty-Five Bodies of Soldiers Are
Interred in the National Ceme
tery and Sixty More ArÂ«
Shipped East
Colonel Eskridge, commandant at thÂ«
Presidio, is determined to put j an . end to
the escape of prisoners at the post. ' The
number of military -"convicts: who have
evaded the vigilance of their guards and
taken French leave within the - past few
weeks has been unusually largel The
climax was reached when a prisoner. who
was working in the quarry at the mortar
battery about two miles beyond the Pre
sidio disappeared Friday accompanied by
the sentinel detailed to guard him.
Colonel Eskridge yesterday ordered that
all guards hereafter be armed with re
peating shotguns loaded with buckshot,
and the ordnance department at once is
sued twenty of these weapons. Hereafter
If a prisoner attempts to escape he will
take big chances, as buckshot Is much
more effective in bringing down a run
away than a rifle bullet. '-Â¦" .-'--Â¦
The bodies of twenty-live soldiers who
lost their lives in the Philippines were
buried in the national cemetery at the
Presidio yesterday. The . nineteen unÂ»

regular chaplain. Among the bodies
buried was that of Sergeant Radcliff,
Sixth Artillery, who was killed in action'

Ping Kong Tong Claims That Police
Wrecked Its Meeting Hall
and Will Bring
Suit.
The funerals of Low Chung and Pong
Kue, the two Sam Yup merchants who
were .murdered last week, took place with
elaborate ceremonies in Chinatown yes
terday. The most peculiar feature of the
burials perhaps was the fact that both
men were laid away grasping pistols and
daggers In their s aliened hands, symboli
cal of the deaths they met and the events
â¢which led up to them. The services,
which were the most elaborate held in
Chinatown for some time, and which
were arranged at a meeting of the Sam
Tup Society Friday night, were held un
der a canopy stretched over the street
and in front of the store formerly occu
pied by the dead men. Hundreds of robed
Mongolians assisted in the obsequies,
which lasted over an hour, and every
form of the Chinese burial rites were in
voked for the occasion. Two hearses,
drawn each by four horses and followed
by long lints of mourners and carriages,
bore the remains to their graves.
Wanted to Suppress Police.
At a meeting of the Six Companies held
Friday night some startling advances
were made to Detective Ed Gibson, who
represented the Police Department. The
â¢warring tongs had filed a communication
that they were willing to cease their
ctrife, provided the police would make no
arrests for the crimes already committed.
Gibson quickly resented the possibility of
any such compact ever being made, and
stated that Chief Sullivan would not rest
until he had the perpetrator of every of
fense behind prison bars. The reason
that such a proposition was made is be
cause of the fact that the police now
have In their possersion the information
of the Chinese murderers, and hope to
make arrests soon, and the highbinders
knowing this expected to protect their
Wed assassins, even at the expense of
abandoning the struggle.
Another peculiar demand made to the
police was that they do not molest any
of the seventeen highbinder tongs now at
peace Gibson replied that Chief Sulli
van was working on the theory of "In
times of peace prepare for war." ' and
would not wa<t until these tongs had be
come involved in some trouble before sup
pressing them. ...
A meeting of the See \ ups was held
lafit night. The Sin Sue Yini? and the
Hop Sing tongs were not present, but the
guev Sings made it known that they were
ready to settle the trouble and agree to
any terms which might be made by the
Chinese Consul. The tongs against the
Suey Sings will not yet agree upon any
settlement, and the Sam Yup Society Is
?articularly anxious- that they should not.
he condition, so far as peace Is.con
cerned may be said to be as turbulent as
at the first of the struggle, and bullets are
likely to fly at any time. The Chinese
Consul has requested the police to double
the squad for the weeding of highbinders
for the next few days, that crime may be
prevented until he can make another at
tempt to adjust the difficulty.
Will Sue the Police.
The Pine Kong Tong will commence

SANTA CLARA. March 10.â The great
est game of the intercollegiate series was
played to-day on the college, campus,
Santa Clara College defeating Berkeley by
a score of 6 to 5. Â¦ The game was replete
with sensational plays. and was always in
doubt until the last â¢ man was retired in
the ninth inning.. -^ Â¦'â¢Â¦â¢ ' .' Â¦;
Santa Clara started the first Inning with
one run and Berkeley followed with two
runs. Santa Clara tied the. score in the
third inning and by some clean hitting
and base running managed to forge two
runs ahead in the fourth inning. Neither
side scored again until the sixth . inning,
when Kaarsburg by ;a well-timed hit
brought in Smith. Â¦ Berkeley scored two
more runs in the eighth, and when Santa
Clara came to the bat- in the first half of
the ninth inning the score was 6 to 4 in
favor of Berkeley. ; Then amid the great
est excitement ever seen at a game in this
locality the Santa Clara boys pulled the
game "out of, the fire,' scoring two runs
by the hardest kind of work. -^Berkeley
failed to score In her half of. the i Inning.

Sidney P. Robertson, a young journal
ist connected with the local staff of The
Call and business manager of Town Talk,
returned last night from a short trip to
London, Dublin and New York. In Lon
don he saw several regiments embark for
the scene of the war in South Africa, vis
ited the House of Parliament during a
session of the House and heard the great
est statesmen speak on the war question.
Robertson says that California wines are
daily becoming more appreciated in the
British Isles and that in a large number
of the leading railroad depots fine photo
graphs of scenes in the Golden State
were displayed that could not fall to at
tract the eye of the most unobservlng
traveler. In Chicago the snow was two
feet deep when he left, and he said that
the automobiles found great difficulty in
moving at all in. the deep snow. On' the
Lucania, which brought him from
Queenstown to New York, the last dinner
on board in the saloon cabin nearly ended
in a fight among the first-class passen
gers. The pilot was taken on board as
Usual at Sandy Hook and he informed the
news-seeking crowd that Ladysmith was
relieved. On the ..strength of the tale a
Member of Parliament opened champagne
for the whole cabin at dinner and also
proposed the health of the Queen. Sev
eral passengers objected, and springing
to their feet they dashed the wine on the
floor. The scene was very tropical for
a few minutes, but at last order was re
stored.
FIRE DESTROYS
LARGE FACTORY
AT NORTH BEACH
?
Furniture Plant of Golden
Gale Lumber Company
Goes Up in Smoke.
Â»
Three Alarms Call Out the Depart
ment, Which Does Good Service,
Fearing Rapid Spread of
the Flames.
The property of the Golden Gate Lum
ber and Furniture Company, In which D.
_H. Bibb Is a large owner and which stood
at the corner of Stockton and Beach
streets, was totally destroyed by fire this
morning. The entire plant was ruined.
The blaze was first discovered by Officer
W. H. Irvine at 1:15 o'clock this morning.
He at once. turned in an alarm, but by
the time the first engine arrived on the
scene the fire had acquired such headway
that it was necessary to ring in two moi-'j
alarms and employ the companies that
responded in preventing the flames from
spreading to the adjoining property. .
Until an investigation is made it will
not be definitely known where the fire
originated or what caused It. It was first
discovered in the rear of the building and
from its location it would seem as though
it had commenced in the polishing room
on the second floor.
The nature of the material, which con
sisted of lumber, furniture and the usual
stores of oils, paints and varnishes em
ployed in decorating and beautifying the
manufactures made it splendid food for
the names, which lit up the skies with a
glow that made it appear at a distance
as though the whole of North Beach was
one mass of conflagration.
The heat of the flames was intense and
the residents of the vicinity have to
thank a calm night and the splendid work
of the Fire Department for being spared
their homes, which â¢ would surely have
been consumed had there been a strong
wind, and had the fire laddies been less
prompt in answering the alarms or less
energetic after arriving on the scene.
The Golden Gate Lumber and Furniture
Company was one of the largest concerns
of its kind oh the coast, and employed
over fifty men in its different departments,
who will now be out of employment, as
the whole concern is totally wrecked, not
so much as one stick of furniture nor the
smallest bit of machinery escaping/the
general ruin. â¢
The principal stockholder In the concern
Is D. H. Bibb, who will be out his propor
tion of a loss that the most conservative
estimate places at between $75,000 and
$100,000. . â¢ V: V .
During the ; conflagration Joseph Wolfe,
a fireman on Truck 2, was caught under
some falling rafters on the north side of
the building and severely, burned about
the neck and arms.
Wolfe, who is considered one of the best
men in the department, has only been
connected with truck 2 for. a month,'al
though he was attached in the same ca
pacity to truck 1 for the previous eight
years. His bruises and burns, -while seri
ous and painful, are not fatal.* This was
the only accident attending the fire, Â¦Â¦'
for the alleged destruction of the furni
ture In its neadquarters and bodily in-
Jury done to some of its members by the
Chinatown highbinder squad. The high
binders claim that the police entered their
quarters Friday night, smashed chairs
and mirrors and assaulted and kicked
some of the Chinamen who happened to
be present. The whole thing is believed
to be a ruse to get rid of police molesta
tion by the highbinders. They claim that
Detective Ed Gibson was one of the party
that did the damage, but at the time
stated Gibson was at a meeting of the Six
Companies mentioned above, and the Chi
nese Consul vouched for his innocence
last night.
The fact that there was no shooting in
Chinatown during the blockade was due
to the vigilance of George and James
Downey and Gus Finn, three special po
licemen who remained In the Chinese
quarter while the embargo was on. They
report many suspicious gatherings, but
always kept the highbinders under sur
veillance and prevented them from doing
bloody deeds.
Highbinders Still Arrive.
A large number of the Wai Ting Tong
highbinders, members of a branch of the
society to which the murdered merchants
belonged, arrived in Chinatown last night,
and are being closely watched by Ser
geant Mahoney's squad and Detective
Gibson. On the night previous the Chi
nese Consul reported to the police that
another band of highbinders had come
from Interior points to this city and were
preparing for work. The Consul sent for
Sergeant Shea and gave him the infor
mation on which the police are now work
ing.
officers of the law to communicate with
him.
The Call undertook to solve the mystery
yesterday afternoon, and as the "result
of an hours work is enabled to give the
facts of the case.
George Storah, who Is about 17 rears
of age, is not being deprived of his
liberty; he is not heir to a fortune ani
he has never before had such a good tim-;
as he is enjoying now. A Call reporter
had no difficulty in Interviewing him. lie
was alone at the Gardner home, having
Just returned from the matinee, and was
preparing to take a stroll out to the
park. He said he had come to California
in search of a new friend and Instead had
found a long lost sister.
"Mrs. Gardner is my sister." said the
lad. "and that is the reason I am here.
When she married Roy Gardner there
was some trouble about it and our
relatives abused her. She and Roy left
Maine and nobody there knew what be
came of them. She did not want them to
know where she was, and when she
thought of sending for me she had Roy
do the writing.
GEORGE STORAH, WHOSE CASE MYSTIFIfcD THE POLiCrE,
FLYING BENDORAN FIRST
FROM START TO FINISH
DISCOVERED TWO
SKIRTS HIDDEN
IN A PARK CAVE
Mysterious Disappearance of
Daisy Brown, a Fair
Young Waitress.
She Drops Out of Sight, Leaving Her
Mother Distracted and the
Police . Completely at
a Loss.
The police have a mystery on their
hands which they are diligently striving
to unravel. Yesterday afternoon Officer
Clark, while exploring a cave In Golden
Gate Park contiguous to the McAllister
street entrance, discovered two skirts, a
black dress,- a silk waist, sewed tp the
collar of which was the number 11, and a
gossamer, which had the appearance of
having seen better days.
At first suspecting that the articles had
been cached by a thief the police officer
lost no time in taking them to pr-lice
headquarters. Detective Anthony was de
tailed to solve the mystery, and by dint
of Investigation he learned that the
clotht'3 belonged to Daisy Brown, an at
tractive girl of 16 years, who up to yes
terday had worked as a waitress in Den
nett's restaurant at 749 Market street.
Further investigation revealed that the
girl had disappeared without leaving aer
future postoftice address. Last night the
police were scouring the city for her, but
without getting a trace of her where
abouts.
She Disappeared Before.
Daisy formerly lived with her mother in
Oakland. About two months ago she sud
denly disappeared and the police were
promptly notified. As she failed to 'ndite
the usual farewell letter her dlstract'-d
mother at lirst- concluded that she had
been murdered. While the detectives rf
this city and Oakland were vainly striv
ing to get a trace of her she returned to
her home and told a silly story of how
she had been kidnaped and held for ran
som.
xit-r story was believed and she was
given her usual place at the family
nearth. Since then Daisy has been a
model young woman.
A few weeks ago Mrs. Brown and her
daughter moved to this city and went to
live in a lodging house at 256 Eighth
street. Another daughter of Mrs. lirown
also livesin the same house. Anxious to
assist her mother, Daisy secured employ
ment as a waitress in Dennett's restau
rant, working from 11 o'clock until 2. and
being paid at the rate of 35 cents a day.
After laboring for several wseks she
finally tired of her' job and frequently de
clared her intention of srekine another
position, where her services would be ap
preciated and her wages increased. -
Drops Out of Sight.
About 11 o'clock yesterday morning she
appeared at the restaurant -â¢and went to
work after chiding the other waitresses
about their appearances. SKfc labored
until 2 o'clock In the afternoon and .walk
ing up to the counter was given' 35 cents,
her daily pittance. That,'.. -.was "the
last ' seen of her. i Her two , waists . and
skirts and gossamer were; found. secreted
In the cave in the park three hours after
she had left the restaurant. ' - : Â¦â¢-â¢Â¦-; â¢-,.
A peanut vender who has a 1a 1 stand close
to the McAllister-street entrance . says
that he saw a girl answering the descrip
tion of Miss Brown entering the park a
few minutes before 3 o'clock. 3hÂ» car
ried a small package, which she aoueht
to hide under her cape.
Her Mother Distracted.
The most puzzling feature of the case is
why the girl should seek to hide her gar
ments in Golden Gate Park. Detective
Anthony is satisfied that, again tiring of
parental restraint, she secretly took the
articles away from ' her home and hid
them in the cave in the expectation of re
turning in a few days and taking them
away.
The mother of the missing girl refuses
to throw any light on her disappearance.
While prof esÃlng an absence of anxiety,
she Is, however, distracted over her ah
sence and has appealed to the police to
assist her in finding her absent daughter.
Among her fellow-workers the girl al
sways appeared cheerful, and at times af
fectionately spoke of her mother. The
police strongly think that Mrs. Brown,
suspecting that her daughter was about to
skip visited her place of employment fi

SOUGHT A NEW
FRIEND; FOUND
A LOST SISTER
Dame Fortune Smiled Upon
George Storah, an
Orphan.
Police Detectives Shadowed a Couple
Suspected of Conspiracy Who
Turned Out to 3e the Boy's
Benefactors.
For the last four weeks the eleuths of
the "Police Department have been
shadowing Royal Gardner and wife of SlO
Grove street, acting on the theory that
the couple were conspirators who were
planning to get possession of a vast es
tate left to an orphan bey named George
Storah, whom Gardner recently brought
out from Auburn, Maine. The police
claim that for all of the time mentioned
they have been endeavoring without suc
cess to get an Interview with the boy,
whom they assert has been practically a
prisoner In the Gardner home.
According to the story told by the po
llca, part of which Is admitted to be true
by Storah, the boy had been- living at
Auburn. Maine, with a man named Ches
ter Edwards. About the middle of last
January he received a letter from Cali
fornia, signed Royal Gardner, in which
tl.* writer stated that he had made the
discovery that he had been a friend of
Storah's father and that as he was lone
ly, with no relative on earth, he request
ed the son of his old friend to Join him
In California, where he promised he would
enjoy the fat of the land.
Storah Jumped at the offer and In due
course of time received a remittance from
Gardner to pay his transportation to the
Pacific Coast.
Some weeks later Chester Edwards,
who claims to have reared the boy from
childhood, became suspicious that the
Gardner offer to the lad had been made
Â¦with some ulterior motive. He advised
the Chief of Police of his fears. He Ftat
t-d that Gardner had never been heard of
before In Auburn and as young Storah
was the heir to a vast fortune he sus
pected that the man was playing a des
perate game to get possession of it.
This Information was turned over to
Secretary Parnell of the California Soci
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children and Officer McMurray was de
tailed to assist in the Investigation.
After five weeks' work he reported that
the deeper he probed into the affair the
greater became the mystery. He had
demonstrated to a certainty four thingsâ
that Gardner and a woman, supposed to
be his wife, lived at 810 Grove street;
that Gardner "had money in the bank."
for he made a daily visit to a Market
street safe deposit vault; that he played
the dog races at Ingleside, and that the
boy had not been murdered.
All efforts to ascertain anything further
had failed. No interview could be lia>l
with the boy. because the Gardners kept
him in seclusion and refused to allow the ,

J. Leonard h&ndiljr. and W. J. Rodenbach
had no difficulty in disposing of Joseph
Millet. In the wrestling Max "Wiley of
the Rochester Athletic Club, weig-hlng IV>

also in the 145-pcund class. In the middle
weight class he met J. Bayly of the Olym

Â¦Wiley in jeopardy twic* in the first bout
and the other two. bouts were equal. Ref
eree Eugene Van Court awarded the de
cision and the championship to Bayly.
The evening was marked by the ex
change of several pretty compliments and
catch-as-catcb-can speeches by the East
ern contingent. On behalf of the club.
President William Greer Harrison pre
sented William Nelson, the wrestler, and
J. J. Dukelow, the boxer, diamond scarf

wÂ«re called upon and made grateful little
Fpeeehes, In which they thanked the
Olympic Club officers and all with whom
th"ey had been brought In contact for thj
many acts of kindness of which they have
been the recipients during their stay here.
Wiley. Scholes and Rodenbach were also
called upon and responded. Rodenbach,
who if a general favorite, made the hit cf
the night. He prefaced his remark* by
Â¦aylng hÂ« was unaccustomed to "speech

had warned them about coming here.
Tbejr were advised to practice walkinsr,
a* that was the only way they would ever

thing congenial here, however, having
been entertÃlned royally.
Scholes thanked the spectators for the
ovation he had received, paying it was the
moet cordial ever accorded him in his box-
Ing career. â
The muchly dlPcuseed meeting of Scholea
and Leonard was an exciting affair, in
â¢which Scholes proved himself by far the
cleverer boxer. Leonard mad* a sensa
tional finish of it. but the shifty Canadian
never seemr-d in danger. From the start
Leonard, was aggressive, his opponent's
reputation apparently not frightening
him. Scholes' favorite blow was a -lett
ia b. which L/eonard could not avoid. To
off pet this he swung both right and left,
but not effectively, although he reached
the body often. His swings for the h^ad
invariably encircled Scholes' neck, doing
no damage. Leonard slipped down in the
second round, and a moment later nt.s
knocked down fairly, staying on his knees
nine seconds. He was dazed from head
and body punches near the end of the
round. In the third round Leonard tried
slugging, and landed one resounding blow
n*>ar the end of the round. The decision
went to Scholes on points.
Joseph Millet took a lot of punishment

The hounds, in charge of Jerry Keating,
the huntsman, and Fred Johnson, the
whipper-in, were conveyed to the scene
lna special train together with the
horses which were to be ridden. After
luncheon there was a general movement
among the gentlemen of the party and
soon the courtyard of the clubhouse pre
sented both an animated and a pictur
esque appearance. A number of gentle
men appeared in the orthodox garb of
the English hunting field and wearing the
ultra-fashionable silk hat of the fox
hunting gentry. Those in scarlet coats
were Mr. Carolan, Mr. Hobart. "qharlev"
Dunphy, Peter Martin, J. J. Moore and
J. Downey Harvey, the latter a striking
typ ? Â°^, the rotund English hunting
squire. This group of scarlet-coated riders
was later increased by the addition of
the hunt servants, Jerry Keating and
Fred Johnson.
Shortly before 3 o'clock the hounds
w i e .u e ?Â£ n> J? 8 & t Â°V_ er from the stable and
with the field of horsemen formed a strik
ing picture on the track in front- of the
clubhouse. The balcony was thronged
with fashionably attired women, who ap
preciated the scene and applauded Mr.
Carolan and hie companions. One lady
tossed a corsage bouquet of violets at the
horsemen which started a perfect fusil
laae of flowers, an incident hardly pos
sible in any other country. at. this season
of the year. &^Â«9*tissÃB)jw'93FHfS
After some gentle badinage had been
exchanged by spectators and riders the
field, which included two 'women â Miss
Marie Wells and Mies Adelaide Murphy
moved down the. track to the 'three
quarter mile pole, where the hunt proper
commenced. Â¦ The hounds were soon oft
and the thirty riders in the field took the
first jump,' a relic of the old steeplechase
course. All went over without hesitation
and without incident, except that r.Miss
Wells lost her. hat. A gallant horseman
went to her assistance, and after restor
ing the refractory top piece went in Â¦pur
suit of the rapidly. vanishing field.": 'ln. his
haste his own derby, . took ' unto
wings and he was forced; to the indignity
for it. The houndsand the
field skirted about the hill to the south
west of the track and were soon lost to
the sight of the. spectators.-. The finish of
the hunt was at Uncle Tom's cabin, a dis
tance from ,the start of .; some .twelve
miles.
The members of the hunt In their desire
to make as favorable an impression as
possible became too impetuous f or , the
success of. the hounds. ..The latter .would
nave made a better showing in the' field
had not some of the horsemen ; cut them
off from the scent under which conditions
they refuse to give tongue. v The field was
exceptionally well mounted,,the .horses
being all in fine trim. Walter Hobart.was
again mounted on his celebrated gray
Jumper. Royalty. The majority of the'
riders still cling. to the severe curb bridles,
in which horses cannot jump either, with
safety to themselves ,; or their riders
through fear of injury to their mouths.
John Lawson was the 'Â¦â¢ exception Â¦to this
rule, havinr the bit and bridle 'which -is
the. vogue in; the English and Irish.hunt
ing, fields. .-, .-;--,., -?:w . ? - y -NC

OLSEN'S CHARGE
FOR A BIG HURL
THROUGH SPACE
Was Thrown Thirty Feet in
a Collisionâ Wants $40
Per Foot
Says Flagman Stopped His Team Be
fore a Berkeley Local With
His Red and White
1
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 10.
Ole Olsen, the Golden Gate expressman
who, while driving to his home one night
last November, was struck by a Berkeley
local and hurled thirty feet through
space, believes that $40 per foot for every
foot he was "hurled" Is a reasonable esti
mate of the damages the Southern Pa
cilic Company should be willing to pay
him.
Olsen's escape from death at the time
of the accident was most miraculous. His
daughter was on the seat by his side, and
he was approaching tne Golden Gate
crossing on San Pablo avenue.
In a suit filed by Olsen to-day against
the Southern Pacific Company for the re
covery of $1200 damages, he recites that
his horses were gentle and that he had
perfect control of the animals, but that
just as they reached the railroad cross
ing a flagman, who had previously failed
to give him any signal of an approaching
train, willfully placed himself in front of
the horses and threw up a red lamp and
a white one before the horses' faces
stopped them a short time on the tracks
and, although "the driver In a loud voice
entreated him to remove himself, he re
fused, and on account of the delay the
wagon was struck and tho driver hurled
thirty feet off the seat."
â¢ Olsen charges that his injuries were
wholly due to the flagman's gross careless
ness and negligence. His complaint re
cites also that for four years prior to No
vember 14 of last year, the day of the ac
cident, the defendant "had a bell at the
Golden Gate crossing, run by the action
of the train from Berkeley, on a contri
vance 1000 feet from the crossing, but this
was removed only a few days before the
accident."

SHE APPEARS AS THE
WIDOW OF JOHN LEAVY
OAKLAND, March 10.â There is likely
to be a sensational contest over the J4500
estate left by John Leavy, who died here
In December, 1898. According to his will,
admitted to probate last January, Leavy
was unmarried and he bequeathed his
property to various friends and a few rel
atives. .ToÂ»day a petition was. filed by a
Mrs. Jane Leavy, who asserts she is the
widow of John Leavy, or, as he waa also
sometimes known, John Lavey or John
Levy, claiming she married him in New
York State in July, 1871. In her petition
Jane Leavy sets forth that the estate is
now ready for distribution and that she
elects to accept one-half of the commu
nity property as a widow's share. . She
wholly Ignores the bequests made in the
will and fisks that B.McFadden, the ex
ecr.tor, turn over to her what she claims
she is entitled to as a widow.

eion.
PAINTERS WILL NOT
STRIKE IN OAKLAND
OAKLAND, March 10.â The threatened
Etrike cf the painters and paper-hangers
that was to have taken effect next Mon

Charles Bradley â wÂ«re to have had a con
ference this evening with the master

men to report for work next Monday,
conceding the increase in wages of paint
ers from $2 T'O to S3 per day and paper
hanpers from $3 to S3 50.
"The differences between the union
psir.ters and the masters have been ami
cably adjusted." said President Farris of
Oakland Union No. 127. "The bosses have
conceded our demands and have agreed
that henceforth they will demand that
employes display union cards. On the
other hand, we propose to protect the

DRUNKEN GIRL FRETS
OAKLAND'S POLICE
OAKLAND, March 10.â The police
have under close investigation
the circumstances surrounding
the case of pretty Jessie Bas
cocci. 11 years old. who was found
maudlin from liquor shortly after
midnight at Seventh and Chestnut
streets by Policeman Qulgley.
The child was so overcome by Â¦ In
toxicants that for hours she lay in a
stupefied condition In the captaln'3
offlce at the City Prison. Early this
morning Inquiries were made which
disclosed her Identity as well as the
manner in which she was made drunk.
The child, an unusually attractive girl
of the Italian colony, is the daughter
of William Bascocci, residing at Third
and Myrtle streets. She explained that
she had been in the habit of visiting
with the Cordanos, living at 655 Myr
tle street.
Last night about 7 o'clock the child
called there, and, according to her
story, drank two glasses of wine. She
left soon afterward, and now thÂ«
police are trying to account for her
whereabouts during the subsequent
five hours that elapsed before the
patrolman found her.
She insisted that after leaving Cor
dano's place she remembered nothing
and could not assist the police a par
ticle in their efforts to find an ex
planation for her wretched condition.
The Cordanoa cannot explain the af
fair either, except to say that all the
child had with them was a small glass
of diluted white wine.
Bascocci declared he did not know
his daughter had been permitted to
drink wine at the neighbors". He said
wine wa3 kept at his home, but under
lock and key and was not used by the
children.
The police will make no arrests until
a complete inquiry has been made.
Police Judge Smith directed that If
Cordano were arrested to hold him In
$300 ball, the maximum limit for the
possible offense. A complaint waa
prepared by District Attorney llynes.
but waa not sworn to, being held
pending the detectives* report.
The police are thoroughly satisfied
that the amount of wine the girl said
she drank was not sufficient to have
caused the helpless condition in which
she was picked up on the streets, and
they want to know who Is responsible
for her condition*
RAILROAD MEN WILL
FIGHT BENEFIT JOB
Organize to Oppose the Latest
Bobbery Scheme of C. P.
Â¦ Huntington.
OAKLAND, March 10.â The opposition
of the railway brotherhoods of this dl>ls
ion to Huntington's relief bureau scheme
was crystallized into proper shape to
night for presentation before General
Manager Kruttschnltt of the Southern Ta
ciflc Company. The conference of the va
rious committees of three from the local
brotherhoods of conductors, trainmen,
firemen, telegraphers and engineers, held
in Fidelity Hall to-night, was the most
important and final of the series of meet
ings during this week in Oakland.
It did not take the fifteen committee
men long to decide upon a course of ac
tion. The session was brief and spirited.
Enthusiasm ran' high, and the relief
scheme was denounced as a blow directed
against organized railroad labor. -A plan
of action was finally agreed upon that
was decisive and yet moderate. The joint
committee, representing all. the orders,
resolved itself into a still smaller commit
tee, consisting of one representative from
each order. -This will make a committee
of five who will be in reality a grievance
committee and a powerful one.
This committee will call upon General
Manager Kruttschnltt and present to him
the objections of .the railroad employe*
to this new scheme. Mr. Kruttschnitt
will be asked specifically the meaning of
the relief scheme and will be told specifi
cally that the men object to the. scheme.
No threats will be made, but bÂ» will be
told, that the organized labor of the roads
does not wish to connect Itself with tha
plan, and he will be requested to use bJs
influence to have it stopped before it la
put in force. The men hope that tho
weight of their objections to the plan and
the. unanimity of their request that it ba
not put in force will cause its defeat.
General Manager Kruttschnltt went East
yesterday, so that the presentation of
this grievance to him will be postponed
until his return. It Is believed that
Kruttschnltt has gone to New York to
consult with C. P. Huntlngton In regard
to the sudden and determined opposition
which has developed to the new plan.
"While the proceedings at to-night's con
ference were guarded with the strictest
secrecy. It waa apparent that those who
attended were determined to make a fight
that will not be to their discredit.
DECLINED TO
APPLAUD THE
PASSING SHOW

Present at Marriage of
Her Daughter.
Ceremony Celebrated at the Unita
rian Church and Only the Rela
tives "of the Groom Were
ALAMEDA, March 10.â Miss Susie Dar
neal and Alan Bowen fell into lino with
the matrimonial pageant this morning,
but Mrs. Darneal, bitter to a degree, de
clined to applaud the passing: show.
The Darneal-Bowen wedding took place
as planned at the Unitarian Church at 10
o'clock. Rev. George R. Dodson officiat
ed. It was a simple affair. The Immedi
ate members of the Bowen family were
the only relatives present. Miss Darneal
was gowned in a stylish traveling: dress.
iÂ»ilss Charlotte Bowen was the* brides
maid. Benton Bowen acted as best man.
A number of friends broke in upon the
young couple just after the ceremony,
was over, offering congratulations. Short
ly afterward they left for a tour of
Southern California, When they return
they will reside for a time with. Mr.
Bowen's parents at 900 Union street.
Although Mrs. Darneal assisted in the
preparation of her daughter's trousseau,
she still remained opposed to young
Bowen as a son-in-law and manifested
her displeasure by refusing to attend the
wedding.
DEMANDS FIFTY
THOUSAND FOR A
BROKEN PROMISE
Julia Calhoun Begins An
other Action Against
Fred Wundenberg.
First Tries to Force THâ¢ to Marry
Her and Now Seeks to Recover
Damages for Lacerated
Feelings.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, March 10.
The value of a husband is placed by
Julia A. Calhoun at $50,00), and a broken
promise of marriace is the basis of a
damage suit to recover that amount, be
gun by her to-day against Frederick
Wundenberg, a wealthy rancher of Ala
meda County.
The action is a sequel of another suit
brought by Miss Calhoun against Wun
denberg only a few days ago, wherein she
related a story of sad disappointment and
lacerated affections. She asserted then
that several years ago Wundenberg had
promised to marry her and give her a
happy home on Filbert street, this city.
It appeared from the complaint in that
action that Wundenberg had executed the
latter part of his promise; he had install
ed the object of his love in the Filbert-
Ftrect residence, but thereafter distance
lf>nt enchantment and he returned to his
ranch up the country to mingle with his
herds and look after his cabbages. Nor
did he ever summons the young woman
to meet him at the altar nor deed to her
the promised home. Hence she appealed!
to the Superior Court to coerce her re
calcitrant lover to make her his bride.
Now she seeks what she regards as some-
Thing more substantial and more durable
than Wundenberg's love.
In the suit filed to-day on her behalf by
Attorneys Crittenden Thornton and John
P. Rlley is again recited the fact that on
July 1. 188 S. Wundenberg promised to
marry her within a reasonable time; that
although she is and ever has been ready
and willing to marry him a reasonable
Time has elapsed since the making of this
promise; but Wundenberg. still refusing,
has Minted her hopes and lacerated her
feelings no her damage in the sum of JT.O.
000. I- or that amount she now seeks

OAKLAND ELKS WILL PARALYZE THE
TOWN WITH A THREE-RING CIRCUS
OA.KLAND, March 10.â The Elks are
going to have a circus. They gen
erally do, but this time it is to be
a real three-ring show under one
canvas, rivaling the splendors of the
Orient in every feature. The circus will
open in Oakland, March 19. and there will
be six performances, two daily.

ply the amateur talent, and it has drawn
upon a large number of its members to
make up the programme.
The whole aggregation has been given
in charge of Harvey Sloper, manager of
the Southern Pacific peanut butchery.

DEATH CAUSED
BY A VIOLENT
COUGHING FIT
Â«
Sudden Demise During a
Spasm of a Convales
cent Patient.
The Attending Physician Explains
the Peculiar Feature of the Pass
ing Away of Q. J.
Myers.
â >
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 10.
Muscular exertion from a violent fit of
coughing caused the death yesterday of
G. J. Myers at his home on Alcatraz
avenue. Golden Gate. Myers was sup
posed to have been recuperating from
a long illness. He arose during the day.
and while near his bed was seized with a
spasm of coughing. Mrs. Myers was near
by and heard her husband's call for as
sistance. He died in her arms while she
was trying to get him back to bed.
The peculiar circumstances surrounding
the death led Dr. J. Burris Wood, who
had been attending Myers, to make ex
planations, from a medical standpoint,
concerning his patient's demise.
"Mr. Myers had been convalescing from
an attack of pleurisy, and although very
weak was doing fairly well," said the
doctor. "Yesterday afternoon I was
called hurriedly to the house, to find the
patient dead. He had succumbed while
violently coughing. The overexertion
from the spasm affected his heart and
death came very suddenly. Of course, his
heart was weak, otherwise the coughing
might not have resulted fatally.
"There is no doubt that the violent
coughing was the primary cause of
death." . â,

E. Kent, in San Francisco. He leaves a
widow and seven children.
WOMEN STUDENTS
SHOW INTEREST
IN ATHLETICS
Co-Eds at Large Colleges
Indulge in Physical
Exercises.
?
University of California Banks Fourth
in Size of Its Gymnasium, Which,
However, Lacks a Swim
ming Tank.
?
BERKELEY, March 10.â Professor "Wal
ter E. Magee of the University of Cali
fornia, who has just returned to Berkeley
after spending two months In studying
the work of the gymnasiums of the prom
inent colleges of the- East, has prepared
an article on university athletics. He
Â¦ says:
"There is a striking difference between
the appearance of the students at those
universities where gymnasium work is
compulsory and those where it is merely
optional. In the colleges where military
Instruction Is combined with compulsory
gymnasium exercise the carriage, bearing
and physical condition of the young men
are especially noticeable and worthy of
admiration. An interesting contrast is of
fered at the University of Nebraska,
where gymnasium work Is prescribed for
all the women for the first two years, but
is merely optional with the men. The
general appearance of the women was no
ticeably better than that of the male 3tu
dents.
"It is a noticeable fact that the gymna
sium work of women at many America.!
colleges exceeds in effectiveness the gym
nasium work for men. This haa come
about, I believe, because of the great agi
tation in favor of physical training for
women and because of the realization
that the college girl is particularly In
need of systematic physical exercise.
"An interesting feature of collega life
for women is the growth of interest in
outdoor sports. At Vassar there are ex
cellent opportunities for rowing and sail-
Ing in summer and skating and ice-boat
ing in winter on the Hudson. Basket-ball
Is very popular, as well as golf, and there
Is a track on which the college girls prac
tice for the high jump and sprints and
other track athletics.
,"A popular feature of the gymnasium
at a great many of the universities which
I visited is the swimming tanks. Colum
bia has the finest natatorium In the coun
try. The marble pool Is 150x50 and con
tains 200,000 gallons of water. It is warm
ed in winter. The depth varies from four
to ten feet. The pool Is Illuminated by
electric lights placed around the sides be
neath the surface of the water.
"The West Point gymnasium Is similar
in its equipment to that of the University
of California, with the exception that it
has a large swimming tank, something of
which California is in great need. The
work at West Point Is by far the best
that I have seen anywhere.
"When the extension to the gymnasium
of the University of California Is com
pleted we will stand fourth among Amer
ican universities In the amount of floor
space devoted to exercising room. Only
Columbia, Wisconsin and Minnesota will
exceed us in this respect. The enlarged
gymnasium will accommodate a class of
300 at one time."

ALEXANDER CARTER HAD
A SUICIDAL MANIA
Had Threatened to End His Life
by Means of a
Razor. .
BERKELEY, March 10.â Alexander
Carter, who killed his brother Charles
and shot himself, had a strongly devel
oped suicidal mania, according to the tes
timony at the inquest held by Coroner
Mehrmann this evening at the Carter res
idence. 2111 Rose street. Several weeks
ago Alexander, who had been threatening
suicide, got a razor with which to end
his life. Before he could use the keen
edged tool members of the family took
it away from him.
"They had been extremely careful," tes
tified Thomas Jose, a brother-in-law of
the dead man, "to keep weapons away
from Alexander, realizing his deranged
condition. The pistol he used had been
carefully concealed from them."
None of the immediate members of the
family were called to testify. Deputy
Coroner Strelghtif told of the finding oÂ£
morphine in Alexander's clothes, and
said the dead man had been given to its
use to quiet his nerves. Dr. H. X. Rowell
and Dr. J. E. Kelsey gave the medical
phases of the case, both declaring that
Charles was shot while he slept. The
verdict found that Alexander Carter had
killed his brother while insane and that
tho fratricide had taken his own life.
There will be a double funeral to-mor
row morning at 9 o'clock from the Carter
residence. The bodies will be sent to
Byron for Interment.
A large delegation from the freshman
class at the University of California, of
which Charles Carter was a member, will
attend the services.
WANT KELLY TO
COACH THE TEAM
BERKELEY. March 10. â Manager
Shuey of the football team last night sent
an offer of $2000 to Addlson W. Kelly at
Princeton, asking him to coach the Uni
versity of California football team this
year. Kelly was assistant coach under
Cochran last year and Is familiar with
the university and its material and the
students want him. He has refused an
offer of $1500, and the students have raised
that $500.
THE FUTURE OF OAKLAND.
FRANK K. MOTT
THERE is no city on this coast
that has been favored with <so
many natural advantages as
has the city of Oakland, not
only as an attractive placa of
residence, but also â¢ for the develop
ment of a commercial center. It Is
time that Oakland should commence to
develop some of those "natural ad
vantages" and take her place in the
front rank of American cities. We
not only want to make the city at
tractive for home-seekers, but we
ought to do some things that will en
courage capital as well. For where
there is capital and money In plenty
there is bound to be enterprise nnJ
Improvement. There is really nothing
to-day In the city of Oakland thiit
would attract a man with, say," $IUO,
000 to invest. Permanent public im
provements have been suffered to lax
too long, and we are losing opportu
nities every day to secure some of
these hundred thousand dollar men.
There Is ro question, no possible
doubt, but that attractive municipal
buildings, sanitary and fireproof
school-houses, perfect sewer system]
parks and boulevards, municipal v/ater
supply and ether things that an up-to
date city provides are necessary, and
conduce to the building up of tho mu
nicipality. There Is no way to obtain
these within', the 'lifetime of the pres
ent population except by borrowing
the money on bonds, and I favor mak
ing the improvements at. once. But
while all these things are necessary"
and will aid us greatly In securing an
increase of population, I think that .
Oakland's path to greatness lies in the
recovery and development of her
water front. It Is true that pending
the litigation our hands are tied an re
gards the water front company's
:lalm, but there is an opportunity to
jbtaln property outside of the, wnter
'ront company's lines,, and the city -
ihould proceed to acquire it and com-
mence at once its improvement. Hard
ly a day passes that we are not told
of the enormous development of trade
that promiseswith the Oriental coun
tries. It is only a few days since that
the president of the university, on his
return from the East, said that t)ie
eyes of the ration were on this coast
and its trade possibilities, and he said
further that the President or the
United States predicted a great future
for the Pacific slope. The bay of San
Francisco is the main ! objective point
of this trade,: and if Oakland expects
to â¢ participate :in this trade and ex
pects to '-. develop : her commerce"' with
her own State the time is at hand for
action. I certainly, favor bonding the
city for Improvements, and especially
for those things I that will bring em-.
ployment, : wealth '; and prosperity : for
her people,' develop her water front by
the building of wharves and Drtng
trade to her shores. Â¦"..-. .

UTILIZATION OF WASTE.
Much. Saved Nowadays in Connection
"With the Fuel Supply.
Some of the prominent utilizations of
waste products which are well known to
day are in connection with the fuel sup
ply. In the production of charcoal from
wood there are large volumes of acetic
vapors which, when condensed, are of
considerable value. By charring the wood
in ovens or retorts and conveying the va
pors to condensers and stills 1 , the products
are charcoal, pyrollgneous acid, tar and
uncondensable gases of considerable ther
mic value. These gases are used as fuel,
the tar Is merchantable, and. from the py
rollgneous acid methyl alcohol, acetic acid
and various commercial acetates are pro
duced. The Influence of locality is quite
marked In this utilization, for at some
Iron works many thousands of cords of
wood are annually converted Into char
coal, the pyrollgneous acid aa a by
product being made Into acetates and
wood alcohol. At other works the wood is
charred to secure the pyrollgneous acid,
the charcoal being a by-product, but most
of the wood cut for charcoal Is charred,
and no effort is made to collect the acetic
vapors.
The same principle holds in regard to
the manufacture. of coke. As a rule the
products of distillation from the coal
while being cooked pass off into the air as
dense smoke and are wasted but at a
number of localitlaa the volatile matters
are condensed, and commercial ammoni
ates, tar and gases of calorific value are
utilized. It Is claimed that in addition to
the commercial by-products from coking
ten tons of average bituminous coal. In
condensable gases, equivalent In calorific
value to one ton of coal, result.
In the iron industry there are numerous
applications in utilizing' waste or refuse,
including the production of cement, min
eral wool, paving > blocks or monolithic
paving, from blast furnace cinder; the
remeltlng of converting, of unmerchant
able masses of metal, ladle-sculls, crop
ends, shearings, punchlngs. tilings, etc.
the reroliing of rails: the utilization of
blast furnace gas to heat air, produce
stained-glass medallions of the -world's
greatest musical composers, which are
set Into the walls, forming a beautllul
four-walled picture gallery In the softest,
warmest colors that the sun can paint
through glass of all the saints In melody's
calendar.
The opening night at Fischer's will be
Monday, March 19, and If the management
shall continue to present attractions as
notable our new concert house is assured
of a warm place In San Francisco's af
fections. Jose Badarocco, the great tonor,
whose voice was a revelation to muskal
people about town when he sang here last
winter with the Lambardi opera company,
will be one of a delightful quartet, whose
other members will be Madame Barducci,
soprano: Polettini, contralto, and Vargas,
the great barytone. An orchestra of six
teen pieces, under the leadership of Autru-st
Hinrichs. will accompany these fine voices
appropriately, and while you sit and enjoy
your order from the cafe, which is part of
the concert house, you may listen to and
look at selected scenes from the greatest
operas on the well arranged stage in
front. The whole scheme is a combina
tion of music and companionable eating
and drinking on the plan of the comfort
loving Germans. Americans are quite as
comfort-loving and nearly as musical, so
the concert house is likely to be a success.
A email admission fee Is to be charged;
not large enough to keep away the thritt
iest music lover, yet sufficient to deter the
undesirable element. Matinees will be
given on Wednesday, Saturday and Sun
day afternoons, and to make the plsee
still more attractive to ladies an entire
balcony will be reserved for them nn-1
their escorts.
E. A. Fischer, the proprietor of the new
amusement place, conducted the Oberon
for years. The concert house will get the
benefit of all of Mr. Fischer's experience.
I. G. Mooser. whose name is familiar to
newspaper men and amusement lovers
throughout the East, will be business
manager for this clever bid for patronage
from the world which craves amusement.

YOUTHFUL WHITECAPS.
Organized to Punish Those Who In-
terf ere in Love Affairs.
What appears to be an organization of
white caps is operating In this city. The
peculiar thing about the organization H
the motive behind it for the protection oi
its members against the intrusion of out
siders in affairs of love. The band, so far
as can be learned, is composed of young
men ranging in age from 13 to 20 year*,
who are sworn to protect each other,
even unto death, if necessary, in order
to keep young men who are not members
of the band from infringing upon their
rights and paying attention to the girl
friends of any of the members. The vio
lation of any of the rules laid down In the
by-laws of the organization means severe
punishment to the offender, and swift jus
tice is meted out to the young man who
dares to mingle in the love affairs of an/
member of the band.
Not long ago a young man from the out
side called upon one of the young woman
friends of a member of the band, and was
passing the evening in her company. A
knock at the door brought the hostess,
and the leader of the band, who had ap
proached, asked In a pleasing manner if
the young man were present. Receiving
an answer in the affirmative, he requested
to see the gentleman on business. As the
young man stepped out into the darkness
he was seized by the white caps and given
a sound whipping and told to leave the
place at once, which he did.
Another case has Just developed In
which the punishment was more severe.
The young man, who was called from the
presence of the girl on the second occa
sion, was subjected to the most brutal
treatment possible. A coffee sack was
thrown over his head, his hands were tied
behind him and he was marched to the*
cemetery, fully a mile from the city, at
the point of revolvers, while the mem
bers followed with threats of violence in
case he uttered an outcry. At the ceme
tery a rope was tied about his neck, and
the end thrown over a limb of a tree. At
this juncture the coffee sack was re
moved, and a ghost bearing a large knife
In its hands sprang out of the darkness
and came toward the crowd. The masked
members of the band, at sight of the
ghastly specter, broke and ran. and the
young man became so frightened that he
swooned and; fell to the ground. The
ghost, who was one of the white caps,
disrobed, and, calling to the crowd, told
them the young man had fainted. The
limp form of the boy was carried back to
the city and laid out upon the sidewalk,
where he remained until passers-by
chanced to find him. still In an uncon
scious condition, some hours afterward.
So far the identity of the members has
been kept a secret, and. though an effort
has been put forth to locate the leaders,
it has been to no avail. The last occur
rence has created considerable excite
ment.âArcola, 111.. Cor. Chicago Record.

CONCERT BY THE
WAGNERIAN TRIO
THE third Wagner concert, which took
place Friday afternoon at the Califor
nia Theater, drew the largest audlnece
that has attended any of theiÂ« de
lightful. entertainments.
To those who have enjoyed the dis
courses of Mr. Damrosch and' the supe
rior singing. of Mme. Gadskl and Mr. Bisp
ham, and have become aware of the In
tensely pleasurable character of j their
offerings as well as their quite extraor
dinary Importance, It is a gratification
second only to the enjoyment of the mu
sic, to note this material token of an in
creasing appreciation.
The subjects of Friday's recital were
"Lohengrin" and "Die Meisterslnger,"
and the manner in which these two won
derous works were presented but empha
sizes' the art of the singers and the clever
ness of Mr. Damrosch. He maintained
the standard of excellence which he set
for himself in his preceding expositions,
with a charm and dependableness that
cannot be too highly extolled. The value
of his remarks and the enchantment of
his manner are evenly and equally sus
tained. His spell is sure and he inevit
ably rewards anticipation. Mr. Dam
rosch cannot disappoint.
While his treatment of the diverse
operas has been consistently happy, it
must not be supposed that he is either
monotonous or limited in fancy. On the
contrary, he handles the contrasting pur
poses of the Wagnerian works with va
riety, imagination, brillliar.ee. His meth
od is at once synthetic and analytic,
but whether he harmonizes or differen
tiates, he gives to everything he touches
the charm of his own fascinating per
sonality.
This was exemplified Friday afternoon
In his delightful illumination of the stories
and the musical essence of "Lohengrin'
and "Die Melstersinger." The legendary
character of one and the more earthly
milieu of the other were set forth with
the truest sympathy, understanding and
In his exposition of "Die Melstersinger"
Mr. Damrosch expressed his theme with
the perfect naturalness and humor be
comir.g the text, and those who have ex
perienced the charm of that spirit *of
playfulness which he occasionally Insinu
ates In his most serious subjects, were
more than ever pleased at finding him in
this instance indulging it without let or
hindrance.
I am intormed that the singularly good
translations of the texts which Mr. Dam
rosch uses are his own work, and furtheT
that in the socre before him there are
only the German words without cue or in
dication that might assist his dlscourso,
and this is but another proof of his great
capability.
Mme. Gadski and Mr. Bispham sang all
their numbers with a degree of charm
that was a rich reward for all that were
there to hear. Mr. Bispham i-ar.g
throughout the programme with a su
preme art that absolutely silences criti
cism, and he indorsed the former suc
cesses in the serious phases of his work
by rendering Pogner's "Address" In "Die
Meisterslnger" with a comic spirit that
displayed the most consummate skill. I can
only offer one comment in an appraise
ment of. his value as an artist, which 13
that In his singing of the Beckmesser
serenade, another comic Item, which he
gave for the purpose of illustration, fil
though it is not suited to his vocal char
acter, he did not altogether succeed In
disguising his own tone and quality..
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Damrosch lec
tured on "Siegfried" and offered a most
delightful exposition of this most Impor
tant and interesting music drama. The
measure In which each successive recital
commends the charm and ability of this
delightful artist cannot be adequately ex
pressed.
The concert which will take place at
the California Theater on Monday night
will be devoted to "Das Rheingold" and
"Die Walkure."

THE ABROMOFF CONCERT.
The concert given by Slgnor Abramoff
at Sherman. Clay & Co.'s Hall Thursday
was mixed in merit. The singing of Slgnor
Abramoff himself was enjoyable, for the
power and quality of his voice showed no
impairment, and he gave his two numbers
with the same good school that is notice
able in his singing of congenial music.
Ferdinand Stark contributed a violin
solo with deserved success. The oppor
tunity to hear him in legitimate solo work
occurs so seldom that a full appreciation
of his ability is practically denied us.
The programme was made up largely of
vocal selections by amateurs, of whom
the majority showed neither merit nor
promise. I believe on principle that the
amateur without some signs of ability
should be discouraged as a menace to the
already contaminated ranks of profession
alism. But few of the singers on last
night's progamme can be said to seriously
theaten the concert or operatic stage.
Miss Paraskova Sandclin has a natural
voice of rather good quality, but her style
would seem to argue that Slgnor Abra
moff is either unsuccessful in Inculcating
his own admirable method or li an In
structor whose potentiality has gone to
seed.
I would not say that he has failed with
William Van Norden, for this singer has
nothing to him beyond an unbecoming am
bition. He sang "Celeste Alda" with an al
most impossible ineptness, which was evi
dent in the first bar of the martial recita
tive and continued to the final B flat.
There was - a marked exception to the
general mediocrity in the singing of James
Nichols, upon whom Slgnor Abramoff may
set some store of credit. Mr. Nichols sang
"Spirito Gentil"- with not only an agree
able, voice, but with evidence of artistic
understanding and a good grasp of the
essential elements of finished vocalization.
He is Inclined to overdo things in the use
of tone color and in an effort at ex
pressiveness, but he undoubtedly has
claims to acceptance and is one of the few
amateurs that I know who show real
promise. Having no other means of ad
vising Mr. Nichols. I would direct him
to hunt up . a certain phonograph parlor
where he may hear "Spirito Gentil sung
by Signor Giannlni, a model of the pure
bel canto. PORTER GARNETT.

GREAT WALL OF CHlNAâ Subscriber,
City. The great wall of China, called by
the Chinese Wan-11-chang (myriad mile
wall), was built by Che Hwang-te, who is
known as the "Universal Emperor." It
was commenced in 214 B. C. by this Em
peror, who discovered that the northern
States of Thsin, Chaou and Yen were
building lines of fortifications for protec
tion against the incursions ol the Heung
noo, and he conceived the idea of build
ing a great wall to stretch across the en
tire northern limit of the vast empire from
the sea to the far western corner of the
modern province of Kahn-suh. It extends
from three and a half to fifteen degrees
west of Peking, and It was carried over
the highest hills, through the deepest val
leys, across rivers ana over natural ob
stacles. The length of the great barrier
is 1259 miles. There are four different
kinds of masonry In various parts of it,
but the most important portion consists
of two parallel walls of burned brick, the
interval between them being filled up with
clay, Â¦ stone and brickbats. Including a
parapet of five feet, the total height ot
the wall is 20 feet, 25 feet thick at the
base and 15 feet at the top. There were
erected bastions upon it at distances of
about 100 yards from 30 to 40 feet in
height. The wall commences at a coast
town known as Shanhal K'wan, runs
along the shore for several miles, termin
ating on the beach near a long reef. From
that point its course is west, tending a
little to the north till it strikes the Yel
low River. Beyond it goes nearly west
till It strikes the Yellow River again and
then goes in a northwestern direction to
its termination near Kraya K'wan. At
one place it runs over a peak 5225 feet
high. The wall Is most visited at Nan-
Kan In the Ku-Yung Pass, a remarkable
Thermopylae, fifteen miles in length,
which leads from the plain at Peking up
to the first terrace above It and at one'
time guarded by five additional walls and
gates, now all in ruins. The main wall in
many places now Is a mass of rubbish.

TRANSLATED WORKSâ A. 8., City.
The works of Shakespeare cannot Bound
better In any language than they do in
English. No matter how well translated
the force of the English cannot be con

it cannot be translated. The idea of an
English sentence may be translated, but
the beauty of the sentence may be lost
In the translation.
POSTAGE STAMPSâ W. H.. Carson

AN ORDER FOR GOODSâ C. P.. Pre
sidio, Cal. A paper on which is printed
"Selma, Marlon and Memphis Railroad
Co., Alabama, March Ist. 1871, pay to
bearer two dollars in merchandise at tleir
store," and signed by the president. Is
worth Its face Value In" goods if the com
pany is still in existence and it never re
pudiated Its obligation. If not, the order
is worth what some collector of cunos
would be willing to pay for It, as such
have not any market value.
SCHOOL OF INDUSTRYâ P., Oakland.
Cal. At the Preston School of Industry,
located half a mile from lone, Amador
County, the boys are divided into eight
grades according to mental capacity and
they are given an education commensur
ate with the time they spend in the insti
tution. In the industrial department each
boy is given the opportunity to gain a
knowledge of some vocation, which will
be of practical assistance to him in after
life and help him to earn living wages
soon after he leaves the school.
MECHANICS* PAVILION-^S., City. At
the time that the Mechanics' Pavilion was
built in this city, the cost was about $53,
000. The seating capacity of the building
is "elastic." It depends what part of the
structure or rather how much Is fitted up
with seats. It has seated more than SOGO
during the Christian Endeavor sessions.
The standing capacity is also "elastic," .as
It would depend upon the conditions. Jf
the idea was to fill the entire building,
when clear of obstruction, It Is likely ihat
from 15,000 to 18,000 could be crowded Into
the space.
CAPE 3 COLONYâ M.-C, City. "What Is
known as Cape Colony was established by
the Dutch in 1652, some attempts at a set
tlement having previously t been made by

taken possession of by the British in 1806.
The Transvaal was Independent until 1877.
In 1877-81 it was British territory. After
the battle of Majuba the flag of the re
public was once more hoisted and in the
early part of ISSI Great Britain recognized
the Independence of the republic. After
18S6 the influx of British subjects into the
Transvaal was such that they outnum
bered the Boers. There is no way of as
certaining how much Oom Paul is worth.

There Is an old church In Waukeean
Wis.. which has no steeple, because of a
court mandate forbidding such a construc-
tion. In 1862 a severe storm swept over
the town, hurling .. the original spire
against the house next door, and wreck-
ing it. The owner of the house got out
an injunction, restraining the trustees of
the church from building another -Â«plre
and this order has held for thirty-eight
years. . -

THE STOCK MARKET.
paat." and the confidence with which plans
arÂ» presented for the outlay of additional mil
lions for taking care of the future increase of
business are powerful influences toward publio
confidence in the stability and solidity of
values. The relatively high price maintained
for the stock of the Chicago. Milwaukee A
St. Paul Company on a 5 per cent dividend
basis compared with other granger railroads
Is significant also of contentment of stockhold
ers with the policy of that company in mak
ing enormous outlays of gross earnings for
Improvements and betterments looking to the
future growth of business. But the prosperous
conditions existing and the expressed confi
dence in their continuance are for the present
overshadowed by the exigencies of the New
Tork money market. The developments at the
p>int explain the unwillingness of large cap
italists to heed the exhortations of speculators
for a rise in stocks; that there Is nothing to
fear on that score and that the new currency
law gives assurance of an abundance of loan
able funds. The confidence is not lacking that
the ourreney bill will result In expansion of
the currency in due time after it becomes op
erative. There has been cumulative force,
however. In the doubt whether the corner can
bÂ« turned before that relief becomes available
without a pinch In the money market. Large
demands continue to be made for credits on
the New Tork bank* for mercantile loans and
for buying of Government bonds by banks
with a view to taking out additional circula
tion under the law. The principal depletion
of New Tork cash reserves is due to the dras
tlo absorption of funds by the New Tork sub
treasury- Last week the drain on this account
reached nearly $7,500,000. but there was Jficlud
ed the payment to the Government of - a
$3,000,000 notÂ« on account of the Central Pa
cific This week, without any such special
transaction and with disbursements of pen
sions Incident to the first of the month, the
treasury has nevertheless taken out of circu
lation a larger sum of money than last weekâ
a sum amounting to more than half the re
maining surplus over the legal requirements
of the New Tork banks' cash reserve. It is
Indicative of the special burden Imposed on
the New Tork money market that the total
surplus of the Government revenues for the
current month amounts to only about one
third of the amount taken up this week from
the banks by the sub-treasury. The explana
tion Is that a large proportion of the Govern
ment revenue Is bÂ»lrÂ« collected from im
porters of merchandise In the form of customs
duties at New Tork. With the surplus ra
eerres of New Tork banks fast approaching
the vanishing point, the April settlements yet
to bÂ« met before relief comas with the cur
rency law. the unwillingness to take out call
loans to buy stocks is clearly explained.
Railroad bonds have been In eood demand,
part of thÂ« buying being attributed to pressure

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. March in.â The trading in
sfVfcs was ltnrely confined to-day to opera
-tiocs 'by mad rooms, as has been the case dur
ing the whc'.e week, but there was some email
b'.t ElÂ£SiSc&nt buying from outside sources,
especially manifest In the taking or fractional
lots of stocks for Investment, which proved
thÂ» attractiveness of the present lerel of prices
to thk*# who are not depeadert upon ordinary
rnon*y market rlrlâ tllllif Â¦ for holding stocks
for the dividend returns which they hold.
ThÂ» wide distribution of the dealings ' also
kdded to the healthy appearance of the mar
ket. The character of the benk statement
cv so confidently foreseen that Its appear
ar.ee was nut awaited for the closing up of
professional contracts. The traders have been
the sheet side of the market quite unSformly
d'jring the week. *â¢> that the closing up of con
tracts stiffened the market very appreciably.
Kug-ar acd People's Gas were notably In de
mand before the Lack statement, but were
rc-ld off ag-ain together with the local traction
frtocks. The obvious unwillingness of price*
to yieid on (he bank statement drove the
bears to cover again. Bugar advanced an ex
â¢rerne S ! Â» and People's Gas Z^i and the
whole list roc* to ihe highest level of tha
morning with raore show of animation In the
Â£caiir>gÂ« than has bÂ»*n evident for t-everaldays.
The bank returns were fully as weak as ex-
DecteJ The ulrength of the day's market must
tit- attrlbutfd to a faith that speculative com
mitments being small, the market Is not very
vL,neral>le to a teni|>erary money squeeze.
Beyond a temporary stringency the new cur
rency and refunding law is confidently looked
to 'or t;>eÂ«*Sy relief. There is an undercur
re-t of Mrntlraent also that some of the recent
he*vy loan expjui*lon would be readily con
vertible or trans>rable in case of any urgent
need of credits, witnout Coln& damage to pres
ent borrowers. Th!Â» wftuld -be true of such
j>c>rtipn of the recent loan . expansion as has
rtnt Into Government bonds with a view to
taking out additional note circulation. The
belief has been held In Wall street for some
tirre j>aet that nothing prevented a general
rise In prices but the disturbing effect of the
acute weaitneM of a few stocks under the in
flurrire d catlses Kpecial to themselves, not
' e n j thins bearing on the general condition mak
ing for fclgher values. But the most con
spicuous of these disturbing causes reached a
culmination during the week and the stocks
affected have retired to a comparatively ob-
EcurÂ« place in U>Â« market. ThÂ«? appointment
of a ' receiver for the Third-avenue company
and the action of the dlrf-tors of the Amer
ican FurÂ»r Refining Company in declaring the
reduced dividend on Monday, two days in ad
vance of the erpeeted meeting, put an end to
the furious speculation and the violent and
erratic fluctuations in those stocks, but Mill
the market showed a li*tlÂ»sÂ» and indifferent
Â¦ crlrit and halted and hesitated, falling by
prorre*Â«tvÂ« stages Into a deeper slough of
T*nir-ftÂ«igTia?lon.. The disappointment of the
expectation of a rise naturally led to the de
r<f-*s'slon In Itself and the market, while main
taining a waiting attitude, has become heavy
In tone and price* have sagged to a level be
low last week* close. The railroad list has
cff/Ttd much better resistance than. the indus
trials and specialties, but has not responded
r.-Jth any positive 6how of strength to the ex
traordinary *>>Â«ibiui of prr>spÂ«Tlty made by the
irreat rai:nÂ« syfUmi of th* country.
The aJinuaJ report of the Pennsylvania Rail

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW TORK, March 10.â The Financier says:
A curious feature of the statement of the clear
ing-house banks of New York City for the week
ending March 10 is that the decreases In cash
holdings and purplus reserve almost balance
the gain in loans, while deposits actually fell
off (491,800. In other words, the statement seems
to imply that if. the loans v.-ere made they were
in the form of cash balances which were taken
out of bank. This is not the true solution, for
It is pretty generally understood that the de
mands due to treasury operations and interior
shipments account for the loss in cash. It may
be assumed, therefore, that the cash thus di
verted dwreaped deposits, a loss made up In
large Dart by bonds which are credited to bor
rowers as deposits. The result of this is wlt
npsped in a stationary deposit account, while
cash holdings have fallen off $5,058,600. and re
serve has Buffered a decrease of nearly 17,000,
000. bringing the present surplus reserve fund
in banks down to $5,676,375. the lowest sum re
ported since November 23 last. As there are no
indications that the conditions which are thus
eatinc into the surplus are to undergo a change
soon, the statement might be construed to
mean a very tight money market were It not
for the probability of the early passage of the
refunding bill, which would release more or less
treasury fund's. This factor is all that restrains
the call loan market from a violent upward ad
vance. ConsldPreii in a broad light, the cur
rent exhibit of th<Â« banks is not different from
what had been anticipated earlier in the week.
The chantt^s in the several items have been dis
tributed over a larger number of individual in
stitutions than usual, but It Is noteworthy that
over a third of the loans are to be traced to the
"Chase National, which also expanded Its tie
posits over $2,000,000, thus indicating a. falling
off of more than that amount In the list of
other banks. The statement hae also been com
plicated by the purchase of Government bonds
by country- banks, an operation usually con
ducted by the city correspondent of the buy
ing institution. The Item of circulation shows
a continued gain, and the New Tork national
banks have now outstanding nearly $59,000,000
of notes.' a sum greater than reported for a
year. It Is conceded that the new refunding
bill will have the effect of largely adding to
the present circulation of the banks, here.
London Market.
NEW TORK. March 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets were quiet and firm to-day,
every onÂ« being- very confident and believing
the success of the war loan, probably eclipsing
America's 1898 record, will infuse life into the
market. A great crowd of applicants was at
the Bank of England to-day and large subscrip
tions are also exported from the Continent and
America, J. P. Morgan & Co. alone have ap
plied for ten millions for American flaanclal in
stitutions, mostly insurance companies, and
they are expected to lodge more on Monday.
The stock is quoted at 2% premium and very
large dealings ara reported. Consols were up
'â¢id. Americans showed a hardening tendency,
but there were no features. .
The bank received Â£45.000 gold from Holland.
There was a good demand for short loans and
discounts were a shade firmer.

CHICAGO. March 10.â WHEATâ Was heavy

expectations that Monday's statistics would
show large world's shipments and a liberal in
crease on passage. The . mild ' weather, where
a cold wave had been promised, was also dis
couraging to holders. NThe market showed
some flrmneM for a time in sympathy with
corn, but failed to hold It. ' The Liverpool de
cline for spot had a depressing effect and there
was little cash talk here. May opened a

reacted to 66% c. at which the market closed,

The aggressive strength and activity of corn,
engendered by higher cables, the cash demand
and the small country offerings, made that

SAND DUNES ARE MADE
BEAUTIFUL BY ENERGY
Progressive Sunset Rehabilitates the
Sun-Burned Hills South of
the Park.
Enterprising and progressive property
ownere have succeeded in making what a
few years ago was a waste of sand dunes
a place of beauty and pleasure for subur
ban residence. During the past six years
street and avenue improvements followed
In such rapid successslon that the south
ern side of the Golden Gate Park began
to attract attention. From a few Indus
trious families who started In to improve
the section about Seventh avenue the
progress " of the Sunset Valley com
menced, and to-day Nineteenth avenue Is
a modernized thoroughfare, macadamized
and passable for several blocks.
The following report of the executive
committee of the Nineteenth-avenue
Boulevard Club will explain how and by
whom this section has been Improved:
To the Officers and Members of the Nine
teenth-avenue Boulevard Clvb â Gentlemen: Some
three months ago your executive committee wu
Intrusted with the work of securing subscrip
tions from the property owners for the pur
pose of planting bunch grass on the sand dunes
to the west of Nineteenth avenue. The object
of this was to prevent the drifting of the sand
over the roadway of Nineteenth avenue, now
being: graded and macadamized from Golden
Gate Park to Ingleslde.
Your committee begs to report that *fter a
great expenditure of time and labor on their
part the work committed to their charre has
been accomplished In a manner that they trust
will be satisfactory to your organisation, and
also to the property owners who so grenerously
contributed to the expense thereof. Â» We have
planted about eight acres at the lower end of
the avenue, between I and X streets westward,
and on the high plateau south of C street about
twenty-seven acres, running three blocks from
O to It streets, and westward about 850 feet '
The grass Is beginning to grow vigorously,
and without doubt will accomplish the object
so much desired. We believe that this Is the
first time that an effort has been made on a
large 6cale to plant the sand dunes with grass
to stop the sand from drifting.
We desire to call the attention of the city
government, through the medium of the press,
to this important work. We have found by ac
tual experience that grass can be planted at a
comparatively small expense. We estimate
that in all the district south of Golden Gate
Park there are about 2000 acres, more or less,
ot drifting sands, and this whole district could
be planted at a comparatively small expense â
somewhere In the neighborhood of $30,000. If
this extensive territory were reclaimed It would
then be possible to survey accurately. . to grade
and to put the property in shape for use. and In
a short time the Increased value for - taxable
purposes would . amply reimburse the city, for
the first cost of the work. An ample
supply of grass for planting : this district
can be had from the vicinity of the park and
the ocean beach. . We cannot conceive of any
public Improvement that could be undertaken
which would be of more benefit to the city of
San Francisco than this, and hope, now â¢ that
the attention of the press and the public has
been called to this important matter. 'that an
effort will bÂ« made to make this suggestion ef
fective, -
We present herewith a statement of receipts
and expenditure* incurred in . the Â¦Â¦ prosecution
of this work, and would recommend that some
copies be printed and sent to the contributors
to the grass-planting fund:, ..:

Bl^nal officer on the brigade staff, vice
Maior Evans, who will be promoted signal
officer on the division staff, vice Colonel
D. E. Miles, recently appointed assistant
adjutant general.
Major Sehmitt of the division staff is
preparing a new form of consolidated re

a glance the status of every regiment of
the guard, and will be a decided improve
ment on the system now In vogue.
There will soon be an election for en
sign In the sixth division of the Naval
Militia. It Is probable that no steps will
be taken to have a division of the Naval
Militia at Oakland or at Los Angeles until
after the seesion of the next Legislature,
for the reason that the board of location
cannot, under the law as It now stands,
locate any more companies of the guard.
Colonel W. R. Johnson has been or
dered to muster in Company I at Han
ford to take the place of one of the vol
unteer companies that did not return to
the guard.
Many of the companies lof the guard
have received uniforms, and the others

FOUR MEN WHO
WOULD SERVE
AS COLONELS
.Number That May Vote for
Duboce and for Thomas
O'Neil.
AEajor Tllden Is in thÂ« Field With
Thirteen Votes â Changes in
the Brigade and Divis
ion Staffs.
The exciting topic In the National
Guard at this time Is as to the colonelcy
of the First Regiment Infantry. There
are now fojtir candidates for first honors
in that regiment. First is Lieutenant
Colonel V. D. Duboce. who. while not an
avowed candidate, and will not do poli
tics to secure the position, would accept
It If tendered him by his fellow officers'
votf s. as he feels that he would be bound
to accept. Then there Is Captain Thomas
F. O'Nell of Company M, Vho is an
avowed candidate and who Is using all
means, in an honorable way. to ascertain
who will vote for him. Major Charles L.
Tllden Is also in the field, and it is stated
that Colonel H. P. Bush would accept if
the position were offered him, although
he is not making a fight for It.
There has been a canvass of the officers
cf the twelve companies for Duboce and
O'lCell with the following result, the fig
ures under each name showing the num
ber of officers in each company for that
particular candidate:

Betides this combination, there is an
other. In case there Is a change in these
figures. Some who are elated for these
candidates mi to ht change to Tllden. If It
should appear that there is a chance for
Tllden there would be a change to the
extent of 13 votes. That is, the votes of
the officers of companies C. G. F and X,
located in the Ellin-street armory, twelve
In number, and that at the candidate
himself would be solid for Tilden. With
13 votes out of the 3i<, it is said that the
four companies named can swing the elec
tion for their candidate. That was the
condition of affairs yesterday afternoon,
but there is no telling what may occur
before the election is called for.
There may t>e an upsetting of all these
plans, because the ofiicers who have been
elected have not yet passed before the ex
amininp board as to their qualifications.
end as the board Is now constituted it Is
to use the language of some of the offi
cers of the Fifth Regiment who appeared
before it and failed, "the hardest board
that the Second Brigade has ever had."
It is just possible that some of the offi
cers-elect may not pass a satisfactory ex
amination, and in that case new men
Â¦would have to be elected, and they might
rmt be In the proportions that are on the
slate.
For lieutenant rolonel of the regiment
it is thought that those who did not get
the position of colonel would not refuse
to take the chance of being elected and
as lor majors, it is asserted that every
caytain who expects a commission would
like to wear the gold oak leaf on his
Â¦boulder Ftrap. In audition, there are two
outsiders who are named a* candidates
These are Thomas J. Cunningham, late
captain of Company K. who was mus
tered out of the First California Volun
teers as major of that regiment. The
other is Harry F. McGurren. who until
recently waÂ« second lieutenant of Com
pany D of the First.

practice of the Second Brigade staff will
