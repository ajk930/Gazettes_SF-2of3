WHY GERMANY CAN'T TAKE THE INITIATIVE.
PRETORIA, March 14 (via Lourenzo Marques, Thursday. March 15).â The
German Consul has handed 'the following dispatch to jPresident Kruger:
"The Government of Germany and the Emperor will be glad and ready -to
assist in friendly mediation as soon as the fundamental conditions to such are
apparent, as soon as it Is demonstrated that both opponents desire mediation.
Whether the desire already exists on the British side can -be found by, the re
publics on direct Inquiry at, London, or through' the good offices of a third
government which has no important interests of its own to consider in South
Africa. The latter assumption is qualified with a number of nations In and
outside Europe, but not with Germany. . Any such step on the part of the
German Government would awaken suspicions and have other than a humani
tarian view. The increased mistrust thereby engendered would not promote a
peaceable settlement. The request of the republics to transmit their appeal for
mediation to the Austro-Hungarian and Swiss Governments, whose interests
are watched by the German consulate, has been immediately fulfilled."

ROBERTS' OPINION OF GATACRE' S DEFEAT.
DONDON. March 16. 7:42 p. m.-Lord Roberts, in transmitting General Gata
cre's report of the Stormberg defeat; gives his opinions thus:
"The failure was mainly due to.re.iia.nce on Inaccurate information regarding
the ground to be traversed to the uisition held by the Boers, to the employment
of too small a force and to the men being tired out by a .long night march belore
they came in contact with the enemy. When it became evident shortly after mid
night that the guides were leading tne column in the wrong direction, I consider
Gatacre should have 'halted and endeavored to find a -proper road, or should have
fallen back on Molteno. rather than' nave risked the safety of the entire force: by
following a route which brought the troops into difficult ground.^mmanded- on
both sides by the Boers."

LORD METHUEN'S REPORT ON HIS DEFEAT.
Â¦ LONDON.' March 16.â The London Gazette this evening, publishes General Lord
Methuen's report of the actions at Magersfontein December ID and 11. dated from
Modder River February 15. After explaining the difficulties of an attempt to out
flank 16.000 Boers and arguing that a blow dealt at the Boer center at Magers
fontefh..would be more effective., he says his orders were to relieve Klmberley; and
therefore the day the last reinforcements arrived' he decided to attack Magers
fontein'Kopje." The general then proceeds to describe the artillery bombardment
of the position and how the Highland Brigade was led to the point of assault after
the late Major General Andrew G. Wauchope had previously explained all he in
tended to do and the particular part each battalion was expected to play. Lord
Methuen then says? â¢ '
.i : 'TTwo" rifles accidentally, went-off;and the .flashes, from a. lantern gave the
enemy timely notice of the march."
the report .then proceeds to 'show that General Wauchope deployed his men
too late and suddenly the Boers poured in a heavy fire. Colonel Hughes -Hall et.
Immediately ordered the Seaforths "to charge and the other commanders followed
suit. At this moment some one gave word to retire, and part of the Black Watch
rushed back through the ranks of the Seaforths. ' Colonel Hughes-Hallet' ordered
the latter to lie down and not retire. After a while the colonel again tried to reach
the trenches 400 yards off. but the officers and half the . men fell before the
heavy fire which opened after the men moved. Ten minutes later the Seaforths
tried another rush, with the same result. Colonel Hughes-Hallet 'then decided'
to await orders." .After describing -sending the Gordons and Guards to support
the Highland Brigade* Lord Methuen continues: . ... ........ i
..â¢"At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the Seaforths were exposed to a heavy cross
fire, the order to retire was given, and the greater part of the casualties then oc
curred. This was an unfortunate retirement for Hallet. He received instruc
tions to 'remain in his position until dusk, and the enemy were then quitting
the trenches in tens and twenties. " Wauchope told me in the evening of Decem
ber 10 that he quite understood his orders and made no further remarks. He
died at the head of his brigade, where his name will always remain honored and
respected. His ; high military reputation and attainments Â¦ disarm all criticism.
Every soldier in my division deplores his loss. He was a fine soldier and a true
comrades The attack failed.: The Highlanders were ready enough to rally, but
the paucity of the officers and the non-commissioned officers made It difficult.
I, attach, no; blame to this splendid brigade.";
The report ,theni proceeds to pay a high tribute to the conduct of all the
troops, under conditions ; as : hard as can be imagined, and mentions specially a
number of officers and* men- for distinguished acts of courage already recorded

LONDON, March 17.â War Interest centers largely this morning about the Boer forces "in south of the Orange Free
State, and the converging movement being directed agalnst'them by Brabant, Clements and Gatacre; Their strength

LONDON, March 17, 4:20 a. m. â With "the, railway communication to the Cape intact, Lord
Roberts will in a few days be in a position to begin the advance on Pretoria. His deep po

crn sections of the Orange Free State, which are rapidly calming down.
Maf eking is now the only point for anxiety, and as it is known that a force has left Kim
berley its relief may be announced before'many days pass. The efficiency "of the relieving column
is heightened by the fact that it is partly composed of regulars. '..Â¦'.,,-..
In the lobbies of Parliament last evening.- it was remarked that Lord Roberts is about to is
sue a proclamation announcing that the former system of government in the Orange Free State
is abolished and promising Free Staters who immediately surrender 'due i consideration.^ n^p.
It is understood that the continental powers, with one excepticn, uncompromisingly, re
fused to intervene. The exception was Russia, whose reply was couched in less firm language, al
though, like the others, she declined to interfere. It is said that the Pope was appealed to; but that
he declined to do anything beyond writing. a letter to the Queen, appealing to her to stop the further
effusion of blood. Dr. Leyds' efforts with King Leopold were quite futile.
The possibility of the destruction of Johannesburg is still discussed here, but- it' is believed
that the French and German shareholders would offer a strong protest. ,
The latest advices respecting the surrender of Bloemfontein show that the approach of the
British caused a stampede* Thirteen trains, each composed of forty cars, and all crammed with
Boers, hurried northward just before the line was cut. Mr. Steyn would have been compelled- to
surrender, but he pretended that he was going to' visit. one of the .outposts, and, at midnight took
a carriage which was waiting for him outside the town and thus escaped. The Boers got the bulk
of their wagons and military stores away. .

that the committee might hold an execu

resentatives Lentz and Sulzer contended
that everything should be included with
a record vote, including names, on each
division.
It was decided by a vote of 9 to 5, on
party lines, to keep the record down as
far as possible to the actual questions,
answers and votes. Subsequently this was
amended so that all that haa heretofore
occurred will stand, but hereafter the
committee will determine as circum
stances arise whether arguments and con

discussion considerable feeling was mani

action was taken, however. .

WASHINGTON,; March [18, â General
Wheeler went over to the War Depart
ment this afternoon. In the absence of
Secretary Root he reported formally to
Adjutant General Corbin, thus complying
with the order from the'department which
brought, him from Manila to Washington.
The general was in* the uniform of a brig
adier general -of the volunteer ' army. He
looked the picture of healthâ better than
when he left Washington for Manila. He
gave General Corbin a. brief description of
the conditions lnliuzon. He Insisted that
the war was over and that nothing more
was to be done except to run down a few
guerrillas and irregulars. There was dif
ficulty in this work, he said, and there
was danger, too, but its prosecution was
not 1 "war." Ambuscades, were frequent
and annoying and it was not easy to tell
whether the hidden force was strong or
weak. Three men had been mistaken for
a company in some cases.
Â¦ The general said that the American
troops were doing splendid work there.
They were sound and healthy and in quite
as good shape as they would be at homo
engaged' in similar service. This was
owing in a measure to the excellent care
for their men exhibited by officers and
to the watchful precautions of the staff
of the army. . .
..Â¦ General Wheeler said that as soon as his
resignation had been accepted by thÂ«
President he intended to make the issue
as to his right to a seat in the House of
Representatives as a Representative from
Alabama. He says the issue will not be
one for the decision of Speaker Henderson.
He will present himself at ; the bar of thÂ«
House and ask to be sworn- in. As he un
derstood-the rules the Speaker. will hayÂ«
nooption, but must submit the matter to
the House. General Wheeler was confi
dent that the decision would be In his fa
vor, though ha realized that there might
be some delay owing to a reference of his
case. to the Committee on Elections.
At the conclusion of his interview with
General Corbin General Wheeler went over
to the White House, his. purpose being: to
secure speedy action upon his resignation.
It is learned that such action; has been
withheld by the President .only to legalize
General Wheeler's traveling expenses and
per diem up to the moment of hia arrival
in Washington.
'General Wheeler was with the President
for some time. On- leaving the White
House he said his resignation had not yet
been accepted, but he expected a decision
would be reached within a few days.

VALUABLE INFORMATION
GIVEN BY WESTLAKE
Says He Pawned Watts' Jewelry, but
That It Was Handed THm by
Another Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call. .
SACRAMENTO, March 16. â Martin
Westlake this afternoon" Blgned a state
ment in which he informed Sheriff John
eon that he was the man who sold -to
Pawnbroker Cooney the watchchain ' and
nugget pin of R. R. Watts,' the murdered
miner. Westlake says that he 'made the
sale for another man, who told him to
sign in the pawnbroker's book the name
of W. R. Roberts. "The admission Is re
garded by the Sheriff as a distinct tri
umph and it will go far toward weaving
the mesh around the parties guilty of the
brutal murder of the Idaho miner. The
selection of the name W. R. Roberts for
entrance : on the pawnbroker's sale book
might readily suggest itself ,to any one
familiar with the, name of Robert. R.
Watts, since it Is in reality but little more
than a transposition of the murdered
man's name. .
Sheriff Johnson, has at' hand the mart
referred to In West Jake's statement and
there is little doubt that the mystery will
soon be cleared up. The belief that Brau
hard and Westlake either I are the gililty
parties or know all about the crime |is
general and it would not be surprising
if one or the other presently offered a
full confession.

Rheumatism is the most common of the dis-
eases that arise as a result of the above condi-
tions. The character of the ilfe-flutd (the
blood) is changed, -for foreign acids now go
to make up Urn composition. These acids give
rise to pain and Buffering. Fibrlnous deposits
in the joints result, causing stiffness of the
Joints and consequent enlargement.
What is necessary to correct this evil? The
question Is easy to answer. A remedy is
needed that will destroy the activity of these
acid poisons, and that will eliminate' them from
the blood. Hudyan performs this- work admir-
ably. Hudyan cure* Rheumatism, because It
neutralizes these poisons. It strengthens the
kidneys and stimulates them to Increased ac-
tivity in order that these poisons may be

LARGE INCREASE OF
NATIONAL BANKS
Many Small Concerns to Take Ad
vantage of the Newly Adopted
Currency Bill.
"WASHINGTON, March 16.â The officials
of the treasury are overrun with work as
a result of the passage of the new finan
cial bill, which involves the funding of
the other long-term bonds into new gold
bonds bearing 2 per cent interest. The
applications for the exchange of old bonds
for the new, up to the time of closing the
department to-day, amounted to about
$27,000,000, all but about $3,000,000 having
come from banks.
The clerical force in the office of the
Comptroller of the . Currency Is busy Â¦ ex
amining applications for authority to es
tablish national banks under the new
law. Very many of these come from small
towns, which hitherto were debarred from
national bank privileges because of the
national bank act. About 200 of these ap
plications have been received and to-day
favorable action was taken on a number
of them. A considerable number of State
banks have applied for authority to con
vert themselves Into national banks.

CONVERTED TO
THE VIEWS OF
MR. SHELDON
Topeka Capital's Owners May
Change the Policy of
the Paper.
Likely to Continue to Conduct It as a
Christian Daily After the
Retirement of the
Clergyman.
>
TOPEKA. Kans.. March 16.â As a result
Â©f the Rev. Charles M. Sheldon's experi
ment this week in conducting the Topeka
Capital as a Christian newspaper there Is
almost certain to be a marked change In
the permanent policy and style of the
publication. F. O. Poponoe, principal
owner of the paper, said to-day:
"When we turned the Capital over to
Mr. Sheldon we fully expected to restore
it to the old form, line for line and letter
for letter, but after considering the mat
ter during the week we have decided that
pome changes can be made which will be
advantageous. The changes to be made
will be definitely decided upon at a meet
ing of the owners to be held on ilonday
and the new policy will be announced in
the paper Tuesday morning.*
It is paid that the underlying principles
of Mr. Sheldon's plan will be carried out.
but that his personal opinions will not
necessarily be followed. The paper will
remain Republican in politics, but in other
rtspects it is not likely to depart radically
from the Sheldon platform.
Mr. Sheldon's leading editorial to-mor
row morning will be an invitation to the
readers of the paper to express their
views regarding its future conduct. Tho
replies received will to some' extent de
termine the changes to be made.
It is understood that Mr. Sheldon wiil
be associated with the paper in a friendly
way, but will have no active part in its
management.
The Rev. Stewart Sheldon, father of the
editor, will contribute an article to the
paper to-morrow advocating the abolition
of public funeral services. His distin
guished son will append an editorial note
indorsing the idea.

" Deab Mbs. Petkham :â For fifteen years I suffered .
with every form of female weakness and had almost
given up hope of ever being well again when a friend
insisted that I try Lydia E. Pinkham's ; medicine. I
took four bottles of the Vegetable Compound and still
I was sick and giving up again when the same friend
prevailed upon me to try another bottle. I did so and
began to get better right away, and now I never have
any of my old pains and consider myself cured. I think
your remedies the best in the world for curing the
troubles of women, and feel very thankful that I ever
found such remedies. If any suffering woman wishes
to write to me privately, I will be pleased to tell her
about the benefits I derived from the use of your medi-
eirie."â Mbs. E. F. Marshall, 312 Montcalm St., San

Inspector Thompson May Also Be

Violations of the Law in

?
NEW YORK, March 16.â The Times to

Grand Jury ; had before it yesterday (Fri
day) as witnesses Captain Thomas of the
tenderloin precinct, and .'Chief Devery,
and there was a i persistent rumor that
the former would be indicted by 'the
Grand Jury before it had finished its in
vestigation concerning ; matters that â¢; had
transpired in the ' precinct. Captain
Thomas was a "witness at hi 3 own request.
He was warned that any admissions made
by him would be used against him In case
the Grand â¢ Jury came ; to. the conclusion
that an indictment for neglect to perform
his duty was warranted. Nevertheless, Cap
tain Thomas was examined,* and after, he
left the Grand Jury room Chief I Devery,
who had for. some time been in consulta
tion with ' the District . Attorney, was
called In. . ; V : " " .
The request of the Grand Jury, that the
District Attorney furnish it with a copy of
the charge made by Justice Barrett to the
Grand Jury on December 28, 1893,' was con
sidered significant from the fact tha,t In
spector Thompson, in. whose district Cap
tain Thomas' precinct Is located, was also
a witness before the Grand Jury. Â¦; '.-.-.
The charge of Justice Barrett held that
in - any precinct > where < the , law was vio
lated ' the i inspector of the ->, district was
equally liable .with ', the | captain, and that
the fact that his territQry. was larger did
not relieve the , inspector of liability. 'â¢â¢ ; v-

PUTS AN END TO ALL "FRIENDLY GOOD OFFICES."
LONDON, March 16.â The Outlook, commenting on Lord Salisbury's reply to
the Unfted States' offer of mediation, says: "Like M. Delcasse, President Mc-
Kinley must himself see that this puts an end to all talk of 'friendly good.of
fices' on the part of any outside power. But President J McKinley, unlike the
French Premier, is face to face with that most awkward factor, his November
Presidential election, and we know what even the best of Presidents can be led to
do at such times. Let us be thankful we have a Pauncefote, not a Sackville-
West, at Washington, for we shall need all our tact and firmness there for the
next few months." Â¦

BERLIN, March 16.â Referring to the Boer threat to raze Johannesburg and
to destroy the gold mines the Kreuz Zeitung remarks: "Such a threat Is rea
sonable because England's financiers are already crying with anxiety for gold
shares and quotations, and secondly, because the Boers would thereby smash
the idol. which enticed numberless vagabonds, questionable riffraff and gold Job
bers to immigrate there and now demand the bloody offerings which Britons will- s
lngly lay upon the altar." ' .

âOstensibly on account of the disturbed
conditions prevailing in the province of
Shantung.:- Secretary Long sent an in
struction -. to Rear Admiral Watson this
afternoon directing him to order a^vessel
of hU command to Taku, to give protec

missionaries. Administration officials say
that the order has no reference to infor

ciation of Shanghai as to the hostile atti
tude of the Empress Dowager to the
"open door" policy." They point out that
If a' naval demonstration were intended a
squadron would be ordered to Taku in
stead of; one ship. They pooh-pooh the
idea that. the Empress Dowager has been
influenced by a foreign nation, presum
ably-Russia, to take the attitude stated
by the association.
Seer* tary Hay has in his possession iiiial
rt-piies of all Governments of Europe to
his "open door" representations, and the
President has under consideration the
question of whether or not to transmit
them to Congress in a special message.
Consequently a hostile attitude . on the
part of the Empress Dowager on the
"open door" question could not be dis
played toward the United States alone,
but it necessarily would have to be ex

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 17, 1900.
HYPNOTIZED
AND COMPELLED
TO DO WRONG
Remarkable Story Told by
Mrs. Lawe on the Wit
ness-Stand.
Â»
Says Frank Dinsmore, Who Is Ac
cused of Two Murders, Had Her
in His Power for Many
Months.
â Â¦ ?
Spec!Â«J Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA. March 16.â A jury at Lexing
ton to-day is trying to decide whether
Frank L. Dinsmore poisoned his young
wife and shot Fred Lawe. husband of the
â¢woman he had wronged, or by the exer
cise of hypnotic power over' the woman
compelled her to carry out his will to kill
the only two persons who stood in the
way of the fullest enjoyment of their illi
cit love. The double, murder was com
mitted at Odessa. December 4 last, in the
house in which both families resided when
the victims were asleep.
According to the written confession of
Mrs. Lawe. the deed was premeditated as
far back as September, when Dinsmore
first mentioned it to Mrs. Lawe, snapping
his fingers in her face and threatening to
kill her if she ever attempted to betray
him. Again it was mentioned in October
and for the last time . upon the evening
of the night of the commission of the
crime. Mrs. Lawe told the jury and
fwore in her written confession that in
Dinsmore's presence she felt herself utter
ly powerless to resist him. but in spite of
herself his wish was her wish and nothing
he said was right appeared wrong to her
benumbed conscience. When she hesitated
to assent to the perpetration of the deed
he would charm her into complete subjec
tion, even though the life of her husband
was at stake.
Out of his presence she was dissuaded
from telling her husband of the plot, she
said, through fear that Dinsmore would
kill her if ehe did. The woman of course
felt guilty of maintaining improper rela
tions with Dinsmore for months prior to
the first hint of the crime made by Dins
more in September, such relations begin
ning early in the year, and ceased only
three weeks, when Dinsmore married Miss
Lillian Bloomfield of Chicago In June.
Mrs. Lawe wrote in her confession that
from first to last, during the greater part
of a year, she was utterly powerless to re-
Fist Dinsmore's advances and caresses
and disgusted both court and Jury by a
detailed account of their illicit relations.
At the trial this week there was no testi
mony adduced to disprove her statements,
nor did the lawyers for the defense dare
to put Dinsmore on the stand in an effort
to break down the woman's remarkable
testimony, which was challenged only
through a scathing cross-examination.
Mrs. Lawe took the witness-stand heav
ily veiled and wore large blue goggles in
order that she might tell the horrible
Ftory of Dinsmore's guilt without quaking
under the withering gaze which he fast
ened upon her with the intensity of a
powerful mind and physique. Her count
enance was utterly obscured from Judge
and jury, which would not have been per
mitted in any court of justice unless some
credence had been placed in her story of
t'insmore'p hypnotic power. The Jury re
tired this evening. The intense interest in
the case is unabated.

a^ked what precautions had been taken
to guard the life of Dinsmore. He left
the Courthouse making threats, it is
claimed, and passed to the entrance of the
jail, where Dinsmore is brought back and
forth. Here he was seen to draw a re
volver and load it. He remained in the
jail corridor until the Sheriff was tele
phoned for. who requested that he give up
his weapon and leave. Tussong refused
and forcibly resisted the Sheriff and two
deputies before he was overpowered. He

PITTSBURG, March 16.â 8y the fall of

McKeesport to-day one man was cre
mated, two fatally burned and two others
badly injured.
George Martin is the cremated man.
George Curvan and Sydney Jackson were

Impossible. Stephen Stobowski and John
liorcneck were badly burned, but will re

Explosions of this character are fre
quent in this section, but the absolute
disappearance of Martin lends an air 'of
mystery to the affair. Three hundred tons
of molten ore, coke and minerals used in
the production of pig iron became fast in
the furnace and Martin and Curvan. as
top fillers, tried to dislodge it. Suddenly
the entire mass fell, compressing the gas
l>Â«?lcw and causing a terrllic explosion.
Not a trace of Martin's body can be
four.d. Curvan when discovered was in a
horrible shape and can hardly live until
morning. The other men, who were at the
bottom of the furnao?. fared some better.
but Jackson is so badly burned. that his
recovery is next to impossible.

SCHORR'S COLT
FIRST CHOICE
FOR THE DERBY
F. W. Brode the Most Likely
of the Candidates at New
Orleans.
NEW ORLEANS, March 16.â The most
important event of the Southern racing
season, the Crescent City Derby, at a mile
and an eighth and valued at $4000, will be
decided to-morrow. The starters, weights
and jockeys as announced to-night are: ~
Knight Banneret 115 ..'. '.Wingfleld
' The C0nquer0r........ 115 .". Boland
Sidney Lucas 115 Clawson
Prince of Veronia 115 McJoynt
SirFitzhueh 115 Mitchell
LampliEhted 115 Knapp
F W. Brode 122 T. Burna
The field is the equal of any that will go
to the- post in a Western turf classic this
year. The prestige of the Schorr stable,
the present popularity of Tommy Burns
and the good reports of the colt's work in
California will make F. W. Brode a
strong favorite, as he is to-night in ho
tels and other places of. public resort., Of
the three Derbies which have passed Into
local turf history the Schorrs have won
twoâ with Presbyterian in 1897 and with
Meadowthorpe In IS9B.
Lamplighted and The Conqueror arrived
from Memphis this morning. The fact
that so shrewd a JudgeasJJ C: Patterson
thinks he has a chance and that so skilled
a rider as Burt Knapp has the mount
brings considerable support ' to Lamp
lighted. The Conqueror is to some extent
an unknown quantity. He is credited
with having done fast work on the Mem-
Ehis track, and Boland, one of the best
oys riding here this season, will pilot
him. Sidney Lucas will have a strong fol
lowing. His recent races and his work
have shown steady improvement and he Is
now as good as if not better than ever.
Prince of Veronia, figured upon his race
with F. W. Brode yesterday, seems to
have but little chance. Knight Banneret
and Sir Fltzhugh are* the outsiders, and
both appear to be outclassed.
The track to-day was heavy. The
working force has been doubled and in
cessant efforts will be made to get It -into
the best possible- shape by to-morrow.
At Its best, however, it will be only a fair
track, and as Brode's best races have been
run over a hard track he seems to be
handicapped at the outset.

WHITE WOMAN FOUND
IN AN OPIUM "JOINT"
Contradictory Stories Told by Sadie
Brown From Baltimore and Ah
Sing, a Chinese.
Sadie Brown, a woman 33 years of age,
who "has seen better days," "appeared
before Judge Fritz yesterday along with
two Chinese, Ah Sing and Ah Chin, 1
charged with visiting an opium den. The
arrests were made by Policeman David
Murphy of Sergeant Shea's squad in the
old Palace Hotel, rear of 614 Jackson
street, shortly before midnight Thursday
Murphy testified that he. - was. in search
of two girls who were supposed to have
gone to an opium "joint" and he knocked
at the door, which was promptly opened.
He discovered the woman and the two
Chinese smoking opium. The , woman
seemed to be in a stupor and the officer
had difficulty In arousing her. He asked
Ah Sing who the woman was and he said
she was an acquaintance of a friend of his
in the East, who died, and he-was to look
aftÂ«r her. 1 Murphy asked, the, woman if
she was to marry Ah Sing and she replied,
"I may later. He will, treat me better
that. a white man." A valise and a man
dolin- belonging to the woman were found
in the room. />;.- -
The woman "said that she came from
Baltimore and had 'been educated in a
convent there. She -arrived here Thurs
day. Ah Sing, she said, used to be a ser
vant'ln her father's house ten years ago.
The Judge fined her and -each of the
Chinese to with the alternative of twenty
four hours In prison.

NO PAIN, TRIFLING EXPENSE.
A Simple, Harmless Remedy for the
Cure of Piles.
A person contracts a cold, pneumonia,,
rheumatism and pleurisy from exposure;
dyspepsia and liver troubles from dietary
errors and the causes of most diseases are
easily traceable, but although piles and
rectal troubles are as common as any of
these the cause is obscure.
Violent exertion, as in lifting, sometimes
produces them and a sedentary occupation
is by some supposed to be a predisposing
cause, but as a rule piles and rectal
troubles appear without apparent provo-
cation.
There are many pile salves and oint-
ments which give temporary relief and
Â¦when these fall the patient, If he can
afford the expense and Is willing to take
the risk, has resource to a surgical opera-
tion. But there Is one remedy which gives
immediate relief and the regular use of
â¢which will bring about a permanent cure
and that Is the well-known Pyramid Pile
Cure.
In long standing cases the Pyramid has
proven to be the only cure except a
dangerous and exceedingly painful sur-
gical operation-, and Its advantages over
any kind of operation are many, as It is
painless, causes no interference with daily
occupation, and being in the form of- a
suppository Is always convenient and
ready for use.
The Pyramid Pile Cure is an effective
combination of soothing oils and antisep-
tic acids. It contains no cocaine nor
nerve destroying opiates and unlike most
pile salves contains no bichloride of mer-
cury nor any poisonous. Injurious drug of
any kind.
All druggists sell the Pyramid Pile Cure
at SO cents for a complete treatment of
the suppositories.
A little book on cause and cure of piles
will be mailed free by addressing Pyramid
Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.
DR. NEMBULA IS
QUITE A GOOD
ONE JUST NOW
Well Played, and Sent Away
to a Running Start, He
Won Easily.
One of the many hard dumps at Tan
foran yesterday was the absolute "snow-
Ing In" of Hard Knot. The colt went to
the post a 4 to 5 chance for the last event,
and cut off almost at the start was never
danperous. The horses were lined up some
yards from the barrier and Dr. Xembula
acted Quite like a gentleman. Heavily
played, he refused to be left, winning gal
loping from Capjive, a 100 to 1 shot. Sly
lost the show to Cormorant.
Favorites In the betting held their own
by taking three of the six events.

BARK KAIULANI
DISMASTED IN
THE ATLANTIC
Built/M; WilliamsTDimond
for the Honolulu Suiar
Four Ships Bound Here Having Hard
Luckâ Chinese Bride Causes a
Sensation on Jackson
Street Wharf.
The : new steel bark>Kaiulani, built by
Arthur .Sewall, &'. Co. ' of Bath, Me., for
Williams, % Dimond ; &h Co.,* of this city,
has met with a mishap early . in j her ca
reer. She sailed from New York last month
on her maiden voyage.': She was -bound
for Honolulu, .. where she was to load
sugar for. San Francisco, j The Merchants'
Exchange | received a dispatch yesterday,
stating, that on: March 5 the Kaiulani was
spoken" with; her fore and main topgal
lant masts gone andotherwise damaged.
She was then returning to New York for
repairs. . It :1s â¢ surmised that Bhe received
other damage In the storm in "which she
was partially dismasted. ' â¢â¢
The'Kaiulani is.the first "of a fleet of
steel vessels now building In the East for
the sugar trade. They are to run in con
junction with. -the new steamers - now
building for Williams, Dlmond & Co.,
and â¢ all . of them were expected on the
coast during the year. ... >
â¢There are four vessels -making unusu
ally long Â¦Â¦â passages to. this >coast.; The
Musselcrag Â¦ Is now out 241 days' from
Antwerp, the Blackbraes â¢ 287 days from
Newcastle, England, and the Emille Gal
line 253 days from Swansea, all for San
Francisco, while the Annie Thomaa Is 230
days* out from Swansea for, Acapulco.
The only one *for which any fears are-en
tertained is the Annie Thomaa and 80 per
cent was paid yesterday to reinsure her
chances. The Musselcrag put Into-Syd
ney, N. S.W., 'January 12,' with her sails
in- ribbons,' bulwarks; smashed and decks
swept clean. . She was caught In the Oc
tober storms off the Horn and was forced
to come via Good Hope. On February
25 she sailed from Sydney for San Fran
cisco. On October 23 the Blackbraes put
into Port Stanley with her sails blown
away and steering gear damaged. She
sailed again February 7 for San Fran
cisco. The Emilie Galline put into Rio
de Janeiro partially dismasted on Novem
ber 4. She sailed again and was spoken
off the Horn December 27.
There is only one- disengaged ship in
port, while at this time last year tnere
were fifteen looking for charters. The
Idle, craft is- the British ship Tinto Hill,
now at Port Costa, and her agents are in
no hurry to quote rates, as they expect
an advance in charter prices within a day
or two. Â¦.â¢ - . â¢: - .
There was considerable excitement on
Jackson-street wharf yesterday over the
departure of a Chinese bride for her hus
band's home on the banks of the Sacra
mento River. A special room had been
prepared on . the steamer .Onward for ' the
Oriental beauty, and when she reached
the dock no time was lost in hurrying her
into the apartment. She was most care
fully veiled and her mother held an um
brella over her head' so as to prevent the
crowd from getting even-a glimpse of her.
Unfortunately, the bride's slipper fell off
as she was getting out of her carriage, and
the mother had to drop the umbrella, re
vealing all the bridal finery. The hus
band is the overseer of a large ranch at
Hiawatha; â¢ '
The brig John D. Spreckels sailed for,
Guam yesterday. She Is the pioneer of a
fleet to be put- on by the -Western Com
mercial Company between here andUuole
Sani's new* possession. The brlÂ£ carri<:3

aijarpe warehouse, all -kinds of merchan
dise,- a! number of horses and' mules and
everything necessary to establish larga
headquarters -for the new-. venture. --s-The
Spreckels will bring back *>. copra,', pearl,
shell and cocoanutÃ on her return-trip.
â¢ The search for the launch which sank
alongside the transport Hancock has been
abandoned. The Government offered a re
ward of $250 to any. one who would locate
her, but no trace oÂ£ the boat could be
found.' Â¦ : : - -

tion at Both Ingleside and
Union Coursing Fields.
The management of Ingleside Coursing
Park 'has arranged a series of champion
stakes, the first, of which will be decided

vitation one, which enabled the park man
agement to select such dogs as it thought

tries are: Hawker, Flora McDonald, Lily
of the West. Connemara. Golden Rule.
Rocker, Beacon and Master Clalr. Thi3
stake will be run after luncheon to-mor
row. The first round of the 5Â»-dog oiJen

dency to senu them up -me neld. For
merly they were turned out of dars boxed
Into .the glare. of. sunlight anu beiore they
recovereu .trom their contusion tne dogs
were down upon them, ifee hares are
always at their worst at this time of tne
year, and the Judges and otner field offl
cials have their responsibilities largely
increased.
'ihe largest stake of the year will be run
at Union Park to-day. To this will ho
added to-morrow a sixteen-dog champion
staKe. In mis are such cracks as Luxor.
KoytU Hush, Warship, Bohe, Whitehead.

ing men will go down on the 10:15 a. m.
train. The l:2o p. m. train for Tanforan
racetrack will also stop.
Messrs. Hussell and Wilson of the well
known coursing firm of Russell, Allen He
Wilson" are expected here from the East
early In May with a string of twenty
greyhounds, which will be ready for com
petition. They will be represented by
Spiteful, a new dog. at Union Park to
morrow. He Is white in color and is by
St. Clalr-Russell's Nancy. He was tried
out with Julius Caesar on Monday and
beat him handily.
T. J. McHugh, the veteran field stew
ard at Ingleside Park, enjoyed some
coursing in the open last week. He spent
several days with "Denny" Healey. the
"Prince of Petaluma." and was lavishly
entertained. In a tramp over the hills
with some greyhounds they started up
several hares, which provided good sport.
Mr. Healey's great young dog Sisquoc la
still ailing and will not be fit for competi
tion for some months. Mr. Healey contem
plates sending' his great greyhound Wave
on to be bred to Russell. Allen & Wllson'3
dog St. Clalr. the sire of the celebrated
Clairs. Her litters by Rusty Gold and
Kmin Pasha have all proved wonderful
performers.
M. London's Magneto sustained a badly
cut foot on Wednesday on the way to
Union Park, The doÂ«c was at hia best, but
will be on the shelf for some time.
Frank McComb has been placed In
charge of the Sterl & Knowles Kennels,
and an improvement la expected In thÂ«
performances of the dogs.
The Lopez Kennels have sustained the
losÂ«: of McGregor, a promising youns
dog. He became frightened while being
exercised and ran away from hi 3 kennel
mates. As Is their nature they set upon
him and killed him.
Among the latest recruits to the leash
men's ranks is Captain J. H. Mulally of
Seventh and Market streets. He has pur
chased the black dog Precede and is pre
paring him for the running.
P. J. Graves, a well-known sportsman
of Seattle, dropped Into the city early
this week, and during his stay visited
both coursing parks, with a view to In
augurating the sport In the north during
the coming summer.
Although a long way off. the Futurity
stake, to be run next September, is al
ready engaging attention. In point of en
try and prizes it wIU so far exceed any
thing ever before attempted In this coun
try that all past events will be enshroud
ed in a deep shadow. It will also attract
the leashmen of the entire country to
the coast, including, beyond doubt. L. S.
Bartels, Samuel Handy, James Russell.
Donahue. Nichols and probably Dr. Hum
mell. The event "Is for greyhounds
whelped since January 1. 1539. and during
that period more youngsters of quality
first saw light in California than during
any period of double the time before. It
was a banner year for breeding, and the
class of dog bred Insures results that will
advertise California throughout the
coursing world.

SAN MATEO HUNT CLUB.
Several members of the San Mateo Hunt
Club enjoyed a chase : after a live fox
last' Monday morning. Reynard had been
captured and taken to the quarters of the
Hunt Club. At about 7 o'clock In the
morning he was given his liberty In front
of the Burlingame .Country Club house.
Soon after 8 o'clock eleven couples of
hounds were laid on and soon picked up
the scent and; led the horsemen a merry
chase. -The fox evidently spent:some.lit
tle, time in getting hi? bearings, but pro
ceeded .first In the direction -of the golf
links and the fields of, the Sharon estate.
He then made for' the hills and rough
country, running across meadows and into
a brook. Sometimes .he Â¦" , doubled and
crossed his | own | tracks. Behind the Ba
rollhet houseihe- ran Into a thicket and
thence struck straight out over the hills
and ;into a deep and thickly wooded can
yon. 1 The hounds were hot upon his trail
and; as. the fox broke cover, he could be
seen on the. top of a hill,; up which â the
riders followed; htm. "He made for 'the.
heavily wooded: country' again, . taking
refuge In a spinney of. blue gums, where
he' scrambled up the trunk of a broken
tree. When the hounds â¢ came , up - he
Jumped : among them and " was killed? by
a" puppy named 1 '- Scarlet.- which Â¦Â¦ was
bred at . the ,:club kennels, the next

the earlier the entries are made the better
for the exhibitor, as the dogs receive po
sitions according to the order In which
they are entered. The number of trophies
offered this year exceeds all former rec
ords, the clu}> itself offering a larger num
ber of silver cups than at any previous
chow. The Pacific Mastiff Club, the Pa

COLLEGE MEN
WANT A RACE
IN FOUR OARS
President Wheeler. Wishes
Rowing to Take High Rank
Among Sports.
The most interesting topic among row
ing-men Is the possibility of a rac? be
tween' four-oared crews of the University
of California and the Columbia Rowing
Club. The boating association of the Uni
versity of California and the Columbia
Rowing Club have quarters side by side
on Sessions basin, Oakland Creek, and in
1596 a boat race took place between a Co
lumbia crew, coached by E. R. Folger of
Yale, and a four of the university trained
Dy E. M. Garnett of Harvard. On the
night before the race the university beat
bouse, with all the boats and equipment.
wm burned. - The university crew, how
ever, borrowed a barge and rowed, but
was beaten. There are several good oars
men in the Columbia Rowing Club, but
many of the best known members, as E.
R. Folger, George S. Wheaton, R. M. Fitz
gerald. F. S. Stratton. H. J. Knowles. C.
O. G. Miller, J. A. Folger and P. H. Re
mlllard, have become golf enthusiasts.
Recently the captain -Â» of the university
barge crew asked some members of the
Columbia Rowing Club If a race cculd
not be arranged between the two clubs,
and the Columblas will probably make up
a crew. The whole matt?r Is as yel.far
from settled, and no date can be set for
the event. The University of California
crew will be made up as follows: Mlnot E.
Scott, '02. bow: David Goodale, '00, No. 2;
John W. Barnes. '00. No. 3; Frank V.
Klngton. '03. stroke and captain.
Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of
the University of California, 1b said to be
strongly In favor of rowing as a college
sport and to be desirous of raising It to
the level on which Intercollegiate football
now stands In the estimation of the pub
lic. Dr. Wheeler is paid, on a recent visit
to the rival institution of learning at Palo
Alto to have upbraided the Stanford men
for not maintaining the rowing traditions
of the Anglo-Saxon race, and to have tried
to persuade them to put a crew on the
water this season.
J R. Bockman. the well-known ex-pres
ident of the Ariel Rowing Club. Is desirous
to see shell-rowing, which is the most
highly developed form of the sport. Intro
duced here, and acting on his suggestions
the Ariel Rowing Club may purchase a
four-oared shell and try to persuade other
boat clubs to follow Its example. i3efcrÂ«
attempting to run It Is well to learn how
to walk, but shell-rowing when once fair
ly Introduced Is likely to supersede barge
rowing. In ordor to encourage oarsmen to
take It up it Is proposed to offer hand
somer trophies for shell races than aro
at present awarded for barge events. The
objection Is often made that the water:!
of the bay are too rough for shell:!, but
in the early days of rowing around San
Francisco shells were commonly used, and
old oarsmen Â»ay that they have rowed a
shell In water in which a barge woul'l
not live. The clubs which first train their
men in shells will have a great advantage
In shell races, as considerable practice ana
experience are necessary to fit a shell
properly, and good watermanship as >vÂ«sll
bs oarsmanship is needed to keep her on
an even k*el and get pace out .ot her.
Robert Ellis, -formerly a well-known oars
man and memter of the Arlels, has re
turned from Manila and rejoined the club.
The Ariel senior barge crew will be made
up as follows: H. Wilson, bow; W."*Mrt-
KTenna. No. 2: Robert Ellis, No. 3, and W.
Howe or James Wilson, stroke.
The Alameda senior barge crewwill toe
made up of Jack Lewis. W. G. Hansen.
D G. Greenleaf and F. W. Ayers. and a
pood junior barge crew has already been
formed. _

BERKELEY OVAL
Athletes of Academic League
in Great Formâ Notes From
the Universities.
The twelfth semi-annual field day cf thÂ»
Academic Athletic League will be heUl
one week from to-day on Berkeley cval.
It Is conceded that the Uklah High School
has the strongest team, but as there is. a
lot of new material representing all the
schools some surprises may develop. The
track will be fast and new records are
expected in several events. Stephen As
blll, r the winner of the sprints last year,
apparently has the 100 and 220 at his mer
cy. The Lowell High School sprinter is
going in in great form.
. Robert Thomas of Uklah has both the
high and the low hurdles safe, as he Is a
star at the game. The half-mile seems
to be between Healey and Thompson of
Ukiah and William Graves, last yoars
winner. The latter has been doing 2:10 in
practice, as against the record of 2:05 4-5.
He was hit with a shot on Wednesday,
but promises to run if he has to use
crutches. Nuckalls has thrown the twelve
pound hammer 165 feet, the world's record
being 173 feet. Weller and Brown of
Uklah are also doing well.
Volz and Llgda of the Berkeley High
School are putting the shot over the rec
ord. ' Fred Lemman of Santa Rosa and
Dunker of the Pdlytechnlc are also prom
ising candidates for honors in this direc
tion. â¢
Henley: of Ukiah Is jumping better than
ever. Costello seems his hardest op
ponent in the broad Jump.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 16.â
For, the past week the cinder path and
oval have been utilized by crowds. of ath

forth his best efforts to "make" his class
team, which is becoming an honor second
only to thafof being a member of tho big
team.; : . ' â¢
The junior track team meets the Ukfah
High School team on the latter's grounds
to-morrow. The men who represent Stan
ford in this meet are Foster, Bennett,
Wardall, Harter, Lawrence, Bowman.
Ferrari and Cantwell. The class team Is
weakened -by the absence of Stewart,
Strcut and Symonds, the stars, of , the
team. While this contest Is In progress
at Ukiah the freshmen will meet the Oak
land High School team on the college
track. As this has- become an annual
event the contest will be a hard fought
one. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ' " ''
The 1903 team will consist of McCaugh

owners will be busy scraping and varnish-
Ing spars, overhauling running rigging,

preparations for the sailing season.
â¢ The regatta committee of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club has been Instructed to
prepare a report on the rules governing
yacht racing, into which" some modifica
tions will be Introduced. The rule defin
ing what Is meant by "a cabin yacht" In
the deed of gift of the Perpetual : Chal
lenge cup will be carefully examined and
construed. Another provision, the wording
of which Is obscure if not absolutely op
posed to its real Intent, is that in which it
is said that the contest for the Perpetual
cup is to be sailed "between May 1 of any
year and September 30 of the following
year." If this provision is literally con
strued the race might be sailed on any day
from May 2, 190), up to September 30, 1901.
Yet the Intent of the donors of the chal
lenge cup "undoubtedly was to Insure the
race taking place during the season when
strong winds prevail on the bay â that is,
from the end of April to the end of Sep
tember.
The sailing programme of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club for the coming season
has been prepared by Commodore W. N.
McCarthy and accepted by the yacht own
ers. April 14 will be opening day. Yacht
owners will dress ship at 1 p. m. and will
receive guests aboard during the after
noon. At night a hop will be given' in the
dance hall of tho clubhouse. On Sunday
the fleet will take the first cruise of the

A meeting of California yachtsmen will
be held at the clubhouse to-morrow to re

son. Next week a meeting of directors
will be held for routine business and the

The sloop- yacht Whirlwind, belonging to
the estate of the late E. A. yon Schmidt,

TO PRESERVE
THE GAME BIRDS
OF THIS STATE
A Convention of Sportsmen
Called to Frame a New
Game Law.
At a meeting of the Board of Fish Com
missioners, held some days since, the
members determined to call a convention
of sportsmen to assemble in this city on
some day yet to be agreed upon for the
purpose of framing a new game law. The
manner of organizing the convention has
not'been determined. It Is expected the
Fish Commission will appoint a number of
delegates at large and will request the
Supervisors of the different counties each
to appoint two or more delegates.
-The courts have seriously impaired most
of the ordinances passed by County
Boards of Supervisors regarding game. To
correct this state of affairs it is necessary
that the next Legislature should make
some' radical change In the game laws.
The ,con%-ention will determine what
changes are necessary and will then en
deavor to have them adopted.
The officials of Marin County are re*
ported to be working on a new law which
will limit the quail season to two weeks
and the open 3eason for deer to one week.
The members of Lincoln Gun Club will
hold their last shoot at Alameda Point
to-morrow. Hereafter the regular shoots
of the club will be held on .Ingleside
grounds on the third Sunday of each
month. Five clubs, some of which pro
mote both'live^bird and bluerock shoot

SPORTSEUREKA AND HER TRADE.
BY the annual report of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners on the imports and exports of
Eureka for the year 1890 a most excellent show
ing is made of the commercial activity of the port.
The increase in business over 1808 is Vjiotable. and
gives evidence of the growing prosperity not only of
Eureka itself, but N of all the region for which ' it
serves as an outlet and a commercial center.
The summary for the year 1898 was as follows:
Exports 123,006,025 feet lumber, valued at.... '..51,373,511 06
Other products 1,396,452 00
Total exports .$2,769,963 06
Imports 37,594 ?i tons merchandise and c0a1.... 1,625,735 00
Excess of exports over imp0rt5.............. $1,144,228 06
The summary for 1899 stands thus:
Exports 156,901,198 feet lumber, valued at.... .$2104,778
Other products, valued at 1,917,175
Total value of exports ...........:. ...$Â¦} ,021,953
Imports 37,594% tons merchandise and coal.". 1625 725 00
iron, etc., valued at.. ..$1,984,393
Excess of exports over imp0rt5; .. ........... i.52,037,560i .$2,037,560
It will be seen there is a very gratifying increase in
every important particular. It is to be borne in mind,
moreover, that the resources of the rich area of coun
try ..tributary to Eureka have hardly been exploited.
The development of that Section of the State is. in ,\ the
future. Much has been done, of course, but more re
mains to be done. When : Eureka is supplied Â¦with
abundant railway facilities to reach the region back
from the coast" and to connect with- the >: main trunk
lines of the State, and has freight rates sufficiently
moderate to give her. merchants a chance to handle the
trade that will spring up in that sectiorii. the: city, will
become one of the busiest on the coast, and Eureka
will rank among the most important of our ports.

My deer sir. when you speak so dlscour
agingly of the condition of Methodism.
do you take due account of the times?
Manners and customs have changed. The
itineracy, a masterly scheme to use un
educated men who exhausted all their
resources ln a year, is now practically
abolished, if even nominally retained.
Revivalism, as a method of religious in
fluence, is out of date. The bulk of men
are not converted according- to the-an
cient phrase, but they are led on through
an unfolding experience which, to the re
vivalist, pure and simple, seems stupid,
dull and indifferent. In view of this great
moral and spiritual fact, are you not a
little severe upon your Methodist breth
ren, lay and cleric? Men do not rise now
to tell their private religious experience
as if they themselves had been the par
ticular objects of divine care; and the
conviction that character is destiny is
more influential with them than figures of
sensuous suffering.
I'm inclined to think, my dear sir, that
Methodism is not dead, nor has it lost its
energy. It has only changed its methods,
but it is still Methodism, a way of doing
it that has divine sanctions that keep
time with the progress of the mind of
man. With sincere respect, I am, yours

constant outdoor exercise, the Boers' have practical
freedom from the diseases due to alcoholism and vice.
-They are ' not total abstainers, but they are remark
ably sober and drunkenness is rare among . them.
Equally important from the health point of view is
the fact that the Boer is essentially a moral man. .On
the other hand, how often are British soldiers pun
ished for drunkenness and invalided through their
vices. Not only is almost every Boer physically fit to
take the field and fight for. his country/ but ; he is a
stronger, healthier and bigger man than even those
who have beenselected by medical examination as fit
to serve in the British army." '
The Lancet argues that the British people who live
in the country are much superior to those of the cities:
"The â¢ efforts of legislation and of â¢ philanthropy
should be directed; first, to the endeavor to get as
large a section of the population as possible back on to
the land. : Second, we should strive to make town life
as similar to country. life as is possible. Therefore our
streets should be as broad and bur houses surrounded
with as much open space as circumstances wiUadmit.
All accumulations of filth which corrupt the" atmos
phere of towns should be removed with the utmost
celerity and means of. communication should be so
multiplied and reduced in cost as to enable townsfolk
to enjoy the maximum of exercise in the open coun
try. ' If we must fight for our empire such measures
are indispensable."
These are big suggestions, and if the Boers do nothi
ing else they can at least have the satisfaction of know
ing they have taught the^ British some lessons, it will
take them a" long time' to digest and "put into practice."

of Methodism here. I have nothing to

great religious power ln our country.
You know its origin, you know its course.
Are you right in your ' complaint or do

Methodism arose in John Wesley's con
viction of the spiritual lethargy of the
Church of England. He had no idea of
disruption in that church, but only' to re
vive its declining power. His idea of re
vival, however, failed and he went out
into the open field of the common heart
to apply new methods for the salvation of
men. This gave the name Methodism,
which was ridiculed and sneered at, and
the witty and sarcastic Sidney Smith
called the disciples of Wesley "consecrat
ed cobblers."
Probably there never has been a -scheme
of religious propagandlsm devised so In

of the time, that could make meager
equipment go so far as the itinerant sys

was made a preacher, and he could walk
or ride wherever he was sent, to village
or open grove or borders of the wilder
ness, and his muscle was as hard as the
leather of the saddle in which ho rode.

GREAT BRITAIN'S MISTAKE.
WE have, heretofore quoted Mr. Blame's views
on the forcible annexation of territory. They
are the views of a statesman and a student of
the world's history and affairs, and therefore they ap
ply to the conditions of which they treated wherever
such conditions exist, and under whatever form of
government. The war between Chile and Peru arose
ever diplomatic disagreements. Chile prosecuted it
with vigor and overcame the feeble arms of Peru.
When she had won victory she did not propose to
stop with the triumphant affirmation of her diplo
matic claims, but insisted up.on taking over Peruvian
territory as a conquest. Peru, being weak, in this
strait appealed to the United States to intervene
against her forcible dismemberment. Mr. Blame was
Secretary of State, and his views were communicated
officially to the two Governments through General
Kilpatrick. We "quote from a volume of the "Politi
cal Discussions, Legislative, Diplomatic and Popu
lar," copyrighted by Mr. Blame and published in
iSSr. pp. 359-36 i: "Without entering upon any dis
cussion as to the causes of the late war between Chile
on one side and Peru and Bolivia on the other, this
Government recognizes the right which the successful
conduct of that war confers upon Chile, and in so
doing I will not undertake to estimate the extent to
which the Chilean Government has the right to carry
its calculation of the indemnities to which it is en
titled, nor the security for the future which its inter
ests may seem to require. But if the Chilean Govern
ment, as its representatives have declared, seek only
a guarantee of future peace, it would seem natural that
Peru and Bolivia should be allowed to offer such in
demnity and guarantee before the annexation of ter
ritory, which is the right of conquest, is insisted upon.
If these powers fail to offer what is a reasonably suffi
cient indemnity and guarantee, then it becomes a fair
subject of consideration whether such territory may
not be exacted as'the necessary price of peace. But
at the conclusion of a war avowedly not of conquest,
but for the solution of difficulties which diplomacy
bad failed to settle, to make the acquisition of terri
tory a sine qua non of peace is calculated to cast sus
picions on the professions with which war was origin
ally declared. It may very' well be that at the termi
nation of such a contest the changed condition and
relation of all the parties to it may make readjustment
of boundaries or territorial changes wise as well as
necessary. But this, when the war is not one of con
quest, should be the result of negotiation and not the
absolute preliminary condition on which alone the
victor consents to negotiate. At this day, when the
right of the people to govern themselves, the funda
mental basis of republican institutions, is so widely
recognized, nothing is more difficult or more danger
ous than the forced transfer of territory, carrying
with it a hostile and indignant population, and noth
ing but a necessity proven before the world can jus
tify it It is not a case in which the power desiring
the territory can be accepted as a safe or impartial
judge."
The exact application of this to the situation in
South Africa is as plain as its statesmanship is indis
putable. The issue between Great Britain and the
Transvaal did not involve conquest. The questions
raised, which diplomacy failed to settle, were far
afield from any suggestion of a change of sovereignty
or destruction of republican government, to substi
tute therefor an imperial monarchy. If Mr. Blame
were alive now and discussing the existing situation he
could describe it in no different terms, nor apply to
it any other principles.
As we have heretofore admitted, his statement ap
plies also as a rebuke to his own country and a warn
ing against expansion by conquest, in which the
United States is imitating England.
We think that any unprejudiced American will ad
mit that the peace of the world would be more secure,
the safety of nations more assured, and the happiness
of peoples advanced and safeguarded, if the just and
profoundly statesmanlike ideas of Mr. Blame were
made the international rule.
Those who believe in the rights of man, wherever
they may be, are startled and shocked by the attitude
of Great Britain and her proposed destruction of re
publican government in Africa. It is a dangerously
reactionary policy, especially when taken in connec
tion with the new attitude of the United States.
All monarchies are interested in the suppression of
republican institutions, and though as liberal a con
stitutional Government as that of England appears as
their destrpyer, absolutism and the divine right of
sovereignty are encouraged and strengthened.
Looking into the future it may be expected that de
struction of the South African republics will give an
impetus to autocracy, against which there will follow
revolution on a scale as great as the uprisings which
preceded and followed the Napoleonic wars.
Friends of freedom had supposed that their battle
was won, and that the ideas which form the structure
of popular government were thenceforth to make their
way in all lands.
But the designs of Great Britain practically re
verse the progress of a century, and may make neces
sary the renewal of a battle that was believed to be
won forever.

THE BRITISH AND THEIR ARMY.
IX3AISER. WILLIAM is hardly more eager for
t\ an increase of the German navy than some
* *V British jingoes are for an increase of the British
army. War is clearly one of the things in which appe
tite grows by that it feeds on. About the only moral
the jingoes draw from the contest in South Africa is
that the empire needs a larger military force and that
it will conduce lo the welfare of the British people to
furnish it. - .
The sanguine optimists who believe that whatever is
is right have long since reached the conviction that a
public debt is a public blessing and they are now about
to add the further dogma that a general conscription
of young men for a three years' term of service in the
army would also be a blessing.
The argument is one. which has long been current
in Germany and in France. It is to the effect that,
while universal conscription withdraws young men
from industrial pursuits at the age when' they are best
fitted to acquire trades or professions and form
habits of thrift, there are compensating gains in the
moral. and physical improvement due to discipline,
drill and regular habits. It is asserted by way of proof
that with her huge army Germany has managed to
advance industrially and to become a strong competi
tor with Great Britain in the commerce of the world,
while at the same time improving the health and the
physique of her population.
The London Lancet; however, has drawn from ths
war the "conclusion that something more than , drill
must be done to buildup the stature and the stamina
of the British race. It attributes the early successes of
the Boers largely to the strength, agility and hardiness
of the race, nearly all of whose men .and women are
employed during the whole course. of their lives in
health-giving occupation.; Moreover 1 it says:

PHELANISM TO THE SURFACE.
Petaluma Argus.
The great reforms and wonderful things
promised the city of San Francisco by
Mayor Phelan under the new charter do
not materialize very rapidly. The new
government had scarcely started before
they had the biggest kind of a police
scandal as the result of Phelan's actions
and pre-election pledges. Ever since then
the corruption pot has been boiling, the
Health Board has been on the gridiron
and the pure essence of Phelan dema
gogy has been coming to the. surface.
The good people are beginning to sea
through the veil Phelan has been throw

day the majority against Phelan would
be 10.000. . The political demagogue needs

THE SCAVENGER CART NUISANCE.
STRAINING at a gnat while swallowing a camel
is what the Board of Health is doing with
noisy energy. It has made and is making a
â¢uge splutter over the process of cleansing China
town because one of. the denizens of that section died
of a loathsome disease, but it permits scavenger carts
carrying the refuse of the city to pass through the
most thronged of our thoroughfares in the busiest
hcurs of the day, scattering the germs of disease in the
atmosphere and menacing the city with a genuine
A considerable part of the refuse carried away in
the carts is of course free from disease germs. When
dust of ashes or house and shop sweepings is blown
cut into the air, or when the swill from the barrels
is splashed out upon the streets, there results an
offensive nuisance, but it is not directly dangerous to
health. Mixed with that mass, however, is the refuse
from hospitals and sick chambers, and witji that there
are always germs of disease. Modern science has
pi oven that a large number of the most dangerous
di>eases known to civilized races are propagated by
perms that can be carried by the air. When these
germs are breathed into the lungs they develop rap
idly and not infrequently produce widespread pesti
lences, bringing hundreds of victims to the grave.
In all well regulated cities wise precautions are ob
served in the removal of garbage, and the carts which
carry it are not permitted to traverse crowded streets
during the hours when business is carried on. A
similar rule should be provided and enforced in this
city. It is safe to say the health of San Francisco is
far more endangered by the scavenger cart nuisance
than by the alleged plague in Chinatown, and yet the
Board of Health makes no effort to suppress it.
The Call directs attention to this evil in order that
public opinion may force the authorities to take steps
to put an end to it. There is no reason whatever why
there should not be enforced here regulations on the
fubject similar to those which have proven so effi
cacious elsewhere. The reform will not require the
expenditure of a large additional sum of money, for
" the carts which now haul the refuse by day could just
as economically haul it after business hours. It is
therefore a reform which can be effected without in
creasing the deficiency in the treasury, and yet would
be of incalculable advantage to the community.
REV. MR. SHELDON'S CHRISTIAN DAILY
?
California Editors Consider It a Huge Advertising Scheme' and a
Flat Failure as a Newspaper.
SACRAMENTO BEE.
. It is a magnificent advertisement for the Capital, and also for Rev. Charles
M. Sheldon, and is about as blasphemous a piece of fake work In the name of
Christ' as history has recorded. If Christ were on earth he would not be found
editing the Topeka Capital or any other Journal. He would have all he could at
tend toâ would, in fact, have to work overtimeâ ln driving mountebanks out of tha
pulpit.' - â¢ "Â¦:Â»>' :?/,-:<:,;;
SACRAMENTO RECORD-UNION.
The whole business is a fraud and a cheat, and after all possible charity is ex
pended for it and the methods to be employed are honestly debated the sound
mind must come back to the conclusion that it is a sharp, shrewd and unconscion- Â¦
able advertising trickâ a trick that is going to take some hundreds of thousands of Â¦
dollars out of the pockets of dupes without any fair consideration in return.
NAPA REGISTER.
The week will end on the 20th and then the Capital will resume business un
der its old management, the circulation will drop back- to something like a
permanent point and the subscribers will be able to tell how they like itâ with
or without Mr. Sheldon, whose book ought to sell pretty well now.
MARTSVILLE APPEAL.
Of courso the proprietors give the reverend gentleman ) the control of thÂ©
journal more as an advertisement r than sentiment. The mention of the venture
in more than eight thousand newspapers will give tho Capital a class of ad
vertising valued at thousands of dollars.
WOODLAND DEMOCRAT.
The assumption. that one man may read all news and blue pencil all save that
which he deems it safe for the general public to read is supremely ridiculous.
Mr. Sheldon's ideals are visionary and impracticable, and if persisted In would
swamp the Capital in less than six months.
SANf A ROSA PRESS-DEMOCRAT.
If the "Sheldon edition" should be made a permanent thing the paper would
not have five hundred subscribers at the end of three months and the doors
would be closed and padlockedâ unless, of course, something miraculous should
occur, and j with Mr. Sheldon at the helm this could hardly be expected.
STOCKTON MAIL.
The Topeka Capital In Sheldon's hands is merely a religious weekly Vf the
straitest sort, expanded into a daily for the occasion. Were It not a money-mak
ing proposition for the interests Mr. Sheldon has at heart it would be a mere
piece of meaningless nonsense. â¢â¢ â¢ -,- - ;â¢_-'
SANTA BARBARA PRESS.
"Whether or not the effort will redound to the good of Christianity, It Is surely
proving a very valuable advertisemant for both Mr. Sheldon's writings and for the
Topeka Capital. * ...
* VISALIA DELTA. >v^
The whole thing Is a monumental advertising scheme, Â¦which, from a business
standpoint, is all right. But from a religious standpoint It Is a sad mistake.

SUPERVISION OF TELEPHONES.
WE have several times directed attention to the
struggle now going on in Massachusetts to
establish a State supervision over telephone
companies, and now revert to the' subject for the pur
pose of pointing' out the well-nigh universal'senti
ment of the people of the State in favor of the pro
posed reform. ,
In a report of the proceedings of a single day of
the hearings before the committee having charge of
the issue, the Boston Globe states that among those
who appeared in support of the measure were repre
sentatives of the State Board of Trade, of the Boston
Chamber of Commerce,. of the Fruit and Produce
Exchange of Boston, and delegates representing the
citizens of Cambridge, Lexington," East Bridgewater
and Quincy. Among the petitions urging the pass
age of the proposed act was one signed by more than
1800 firms in Boston alone.
The speeches of the advocates, of the people
affirmed an almost unanimous sentiment in favor of
supervision. Ex-Senator Dallinger of Cambridge
said:
The business men of Massachusetts are in favor of
and have gone on record in favor of State supervision of
these corporations. Professional men everywhere have
come forward In Its support. Just grievances have
caused this movement for supervision. I have yet to
talk with a business man of Boston who holds no
stock in tha New England or Massachusetts com
panies who has not expressed himself as heartily in
favor of the bill before this committee. It is favored
especially, I would add, by smaller business men, to
whom $50 a year for a telephone means much. That
there is great demand for this cannot be doubted. There
are some business men of standing present here who
will testify to that demand. . .
Other speakers were not less emphatic. Thus the
report goes on to the effect that ex-Mayor Hall of
Cambridge said:
"The undoubted tendency of the times is to protect the
public against quasi-public corporations, who either do
not or will not give full statements of profits to the pub
lic. For years these corporations have received greatest
benefits and privileges without giving either to the cities
or the people anything like an adequate return. 4 The
people of Massachusetts are to-day paying telephone
rates that are exorbitant and unreasonable. There is a
necessity for charging the situation and I believe this
bill before the committee is a good one. The sentiment
of the business men is with it." ' -. . â¢
Ex-Representative Mead of Lexington was strongly
in favor of the proposition. At present the telephone
companies do what they please with tho business men
and everybody else. There is no right of appeal.
Harris S. Bean, a director in the Chamber of Com
merce, emphatically urged the passage of the bill. To
his mind it was only fair and just. If the business men
of Boston did not know they were paying such exorbi
tant rates as they are they might not feel the injustice
so keenly. But they do know It, and they know that
other cities in the West and elsewhere are getting bet
ter and cheaper rates.
Sidney L. Burr, a director of the Fruit and Produce
Exchange and member of the Chamber of Commerce,
followed with a brief statement in favor of the bill. The
business iren of Boston were absolutely under the
thumb of the telephone company" andmust bow to the
dictates of that company absolutely without right of
appeal. Mr. Burr said the rate 3 charged were eminently
unfair. State supervision had become imperative.
It is not worth while to quote more from the
speakers showing the sentiment of the people of
Massachusetts. These. are sufficient -to prove the
widespread demand for supervision. It is to be noted
that Boston protests because her merchants have to
pay $50 a year for telephone service. The charges
made upon the merchants of San Francisco are much
in excess of that. If, then, according to the state
ments of the speakers quoted, some form of super
vision over telephone companies is imperative in
Massachusetts to protect the rights of the public, it
is surely not less imperative here.

MRS. SIDDONS.
From an Original Painting by Gainsborough in the National Gallery.
it was, proved of doubtful advantage to
the debutante, for it induced Garrlck to
invite her to act at Drury Lane, where
her immaturity caused inevitable failure
and mortification. 11l dressed, frightened,
frequently inaudible, her Portia drew
down such unfavorable comment upon the
management that she was curtly and un
expectedly dismissed.
But the hereditary tendencies of four
generations of actors were not to be
downed by this sudden blight. With her
husband and two children Mrs. Sldilons
now returned to the provinces, where for
six years she played, chiefly at York ana
Bath. This perlcd of disciplinary training,
oftentimes necessitating disagreeable or
subordinate parts and dally exhaustive
journeys, caused her, nevertheless, con
stantly to rally her forces and make every
effort tell in reaching that higher plan 1 *
upon which she eventually stood as an
unsurpassed actress.
In I<S2 Mrs. Siddons received from tne
new management of Drury Lane an offer
of a three years' engagement. For the
sake of her three children she agreed to
reappear upon the stage from which she
had been so summarily dismissed. v< lth
many misgivings lest her voice might not
prove strong enough to efface the impres
sions of her former failure, she dragged
through a memorable fortnight of nervous
rehearsals, and finally appeared with her
beautiful 8-year-old boy in Southarno j
tragedy of "Isabella." Her success. was
Instantaneous and indisputable, only sec
ond toGarrick's incomparable first night.
Garrlck had retired from the stage short
ly after acting as Shylock to Mrs. Slddons
discreditable Portia. Rumor said that her
early dismissal had been largely duo to
Garrick's irritation over her unintentional
blunder in making him act one of his fa
vorite passages with his back to the audl
'ence. a mortification which It was difficult
for the vÂ«tenÂ«i actor to brook. Mrs. Sid
dons always felt that he flattered her nn
duly only to dash her heavily downward.
He certainly did not discern in her early
unequal efforts the genius which was ta
make a triumph of her reappearance. .
Â¦ â¢ Since tragedies were becoming Increas
ingly fashionable society lent its sanction
to the popular enthusiasm, and the tragic
actress became a social as well as a.his
trionic celebrity. Occasionally she essaye-J
comedy, but not with marked mirthful
ness. Tragedy. was more favorable to her
cast of powers, her extraordinary physical
endowments, her weird majesty, brlllir.nt
beauty and solemn dignity. So well were
these characteristics combined In her Im
personation of Lady Macbeth that CharW
Lamb said in his "Last Essays of, Ella":
"We speak of Lady Macbeth - while we arÂ»
in reality . thinking ; of Mrs. Slddonx."
While ' playing ' she permitted -no dlstrac
, tJon from the painf ulness -of the drama la
by the loss of husband, children and
friends: twenty-six of her friends dyln? In
six years left her restless and desolate.
The greatest blow was the death of her
eldest son. Henry, the proprietor of tha
Edinburgh Theater. Although her voice
was gone, and she said her sight was al
most washed away by tears, she deter
mined to devote the remainder of her life
to her son's widow and children. Before
her death in IS3I she was overjoyed at the
favorable reception given to her niece.
Fanny Kemble, whose performances she
watched with tears of joy running down
her face.
Throughout her long life of seventy-six
years she was sincere, industrious and
courageous, with an' unconquerable love
of truth which won her the Immediate
confidence of all with whom she came in
contact. Even the riotous mob around the
theater fell back when It heard the deep
voice of the dignified woman In the sedan
chair appealing: "Good people, let -me
pass. I am Sarah Siddons.
Sir Walter Scott. In responding to a
toast to this great actress and noble
spirited woman, gracefully voiced the at
titude of hi 3 contemporaries regarding her
charms.. After describing the usual strug
gle to secure tickets for her performances,
the breakfast near the theater, the day
long wait- outside and the hour's wait
within, after forcing a way through the
mob, he concluded by saying: "If any
thing could reconcile a man to old age It
would be the reflection of having seen the
rising as well as the setting sun of Mrs.
Siddons. Those young fellows." he reit
erated, "who have only -seen the setting
sun of the distinguished performer, beau
tiful and serene aa It was. must give na
old fellows who have seen It 3 rise leave
to hold our heads a little higher."

STOCK COMPANY PLAYERS WHO KISS UNDER PROTEST.
TIEY never speak as they pass by," Is an old song 1 , but it has been resur
rected by some of the members of the Alcazar stock company, and has
even found favor among Thespians and others who are initiated. "They"
in this instance are Miss May Blayney and Howard Scott, leading lights
In the happy (?) family now entertaining theatergoers at the popular local
playhouse. It is a sad story, but it must be told as a lesson to others.
'When Miss Blayney joined the stock company her charming manner and
winsome face won the admiration of Howard Scott, a member of the aggre
gation. He was her devoted slave, accompanying her on shopping tours, buy-
Ing her flowers and icecream sodas, and it was remarked that his attentions
. would result in marriage. That is but a memory now, for a quarrel â only a
lovers' quarrelâ has blasted their happiness and they have drifted apart. When
Mr. Scott passes Miss Blayney on the street the atmosphere in their vicinity
congeals, so cold have both grown toward each other. Their mutual dislike
would never have been heralded to the world but for the cruel hand of fate.
During the present week botn have been cast in parts as uncongenial as
they are humiliating. In "Never Again," which is being produced. Miss Blay
ney enacts the part of Marcelle, who is the devoted wife of Vignon, a talented
sculptor, portrayed by Mr. Scott- During the comedy it becomes necessary
: for both to display affection for each other, and as fate,, or the author, will
have it, they must exchange honeyed kisses. In one scene Scot? is compelled
' to imprint kisses on Miss Blayney's lips, and as the caresses'are not welcome
the actress turns the other cheek.
Miss Blayney has been heard to murmur angrily, "Now stop it," but Scott
believes in getting everything out of his lines, and refuses to desist. Miss Blay
ney has also upbraided Mr. Scott In the "wings" for his cruel conduct, and
has even tearfully intimated that he was "no gentleman." Scott replies *hat
Miss Blayney is as cold as "nor" west. wind," and has informed the lady that
she does not know how to kiss. Miss Blayney answers that "people do not sro
through life kissing only on the mouth," and both have appealed to Mark Thall
' for mutual protection. Papa Mark, is rapidly growing gray over the dissension
In his stock company, but is happy in the thought that all troubles will end on
' Sunday night, the last performance of the farce.
TEACHERS MAY
AGAIN FEEL THE
FINANCIAL AX
Charter and State Law Do
Not Agree on Questions
of Appropriation.
State Law Will Give Sufficient, Char
ter Will Have a Deficit, and the
Auditor Must Decide Be
tween Them.
1 Â» ? Â¦'Â¦Â¦ âÂ¦-
Owing to conflicting provisions in the
State law and the charter regarding the
school appropriation, there is danger that
the teachers' salaries may be reduced,un
less the State law be regarded as para
mount to- the city statute. The Board of
Education is inclined to adhere to the
charter, while Superintendents Schools
Webster will be guided by the State law
in his estimate of the expenditures for
the coming fiscal year.
According to the State law the appro
priation of last year must be followed in
estimating the school fund for the next
term and this sum amounts to $1,090,000
for all salaries. The charter provides that
the appropriation shall be based on the
average daily attendance- in the schools
at the rate of $2S per pupil. The attend
ance now is about 37,000, and this will al
low but $1,036,000, or a deficiency of $54,000.
This must include the salaries of the
four School Directors, amounting to $16,
000* secretary. $1800; Superintendent of
Schools and four deputies, $10,000, which
are statutory and may not be reduced.
The Janitors and laborers will certainly
not be disturbed, and the burden must
fall on the teachers if the provisions of
the charter are carried out. This is the
view taken by Superintendent Webster.
To avoid such a possibility, Mr. Web
ster says he will base his estimate pn the
appropriation of last year.* If the Board
of Education estimates on the basis of
$28 per pupil it will become the duty of
the Auditor to decide the point. .

Property Owners Will Be Ordered to
Place Their Premises in Absolute

Stringent resolutions affecting the san
itary condition of Chinatown were adopt
ed last night by the Board of Health.
They were precipitated by the recent
bubonic plague farce. * "'
It was surmised that the Chinese had
broken faith with the board and it was
resolved that no death certificate be Is
sued by the Health Officer for a deceased
Chinaman to any physician unless the
signature of the City Physician, who
could order an autopsy if he found It
necessary, was first obtained.
The second resolution provides that all
property owners in Chinatown be allowed
thirty days to place their houses in proper
sanitary condition, otherwise warrants
will be Issued for their arrest. In each
case the property owner will be notified
by registered letter.
The third resolution provides that all
underground lodgings or cellars and any
offensive trades conducted therein be sup
pressed within the next ten days.
The board decided to request the Board
of Public Works to put the sewers In
Chinatown in good condition and the Su
pervisors to bituminize the streets in that

SCHEMED FOR A
GAY PARADE OF
PLACARDED CARS
Market-Street Company Has
Invaded Advertising
Business.
Suit Filed by a Local Firm - to *' Re
strain Chief Sullivan From
Stopping a Billboard
Car.
'Â¦*
If the courts will permit, the Market
Street Railway Company, aided by divers
managers of advertisers, will soon go Into
the general high fence advertising busi
ness. Whether. or not the company -will
be permitted to defeat the intention of
the people to beautify the city by forcing
the removal of fence-board signs and roof
displays, by placing their old and unused
.cars at the disposal of advertisers that
they may send unsightly signs on wheels
through the streets, will be decided in the
near future in the Superior Court.
Suit was filed yesterday by Glen C. Barn
hart, Ed iL Swasey and John F. Sheehan,
doing business under the firm name of
Barnhart & Swasey, managers of adver
tising, to restrain Chief of Police Sullivan
from sidetracking their advertising car
and refusing to sanction Its use by the
plaintiff corporation.
In the complaint plaintiffs say that on
February 14, 1900, they leased a car from
the Market Street Railway Company, the
company agreeing to furnish power for
the purpose of propelling the car through
the streets of the city. Advertising pla
cards were attached to the sides, front
and rear of the car, but "no bell or gonÂ£
or other musical or noise-producing in
struments of any sort" were permitted on
the car, save the ordinary gongs used to
warn vehicles and pedestrians of its ap
proach.
Continuing, plaintiffs allege that Chief
Sullivan, by means of his authority, has
prevented and threatens to continue to
prevent the operation of the car. "The
said action is unlawful," the complaint
reads, "and is unlawful and without right,
and unless defendant is restrained from
continuing such interference these plain
tiffs will be damaged in a great and Ir
reparable manner."
In conclusion plaintiffs pray that an in
junction be issued forever restraining
Chief of Police Sullivan, or those acting
by virtue of his orders, from interfering
with the operation of the car. Chief Su!li
van ordered the withdrawal of the adver
tising car from the lines of the Market
Street Railway Company about two wetks
ago. He contends that the franchise hel<l

Buffered the (rriel and anguish shared by bo many
true and faithful women of America to-day, who

determined to overcome this fearful evil M possible.
Her search for a harmless, perfect and secret home
cure was at last rewarded when an old friend can:*
to her and grave her a remedy which had never beea
known to fail. Mrs. Ha wkins pave the remedy sec-
retly and in a few weeks, to her great joy , her dearest
relative was entirely cured of his appetite for drink
and was acrain restored to health and manhood.
After this wonderful result, Mr 3. Hawkins de-
cided to devote her life to the work of helping- her
eisters every where, whom she found suffering 1 as she
had suffered from the effects of alcohol upoi . a hus-
band, father or son. With the assistance of others
she perfected the oriÂ«rinal treatment and now
offers to send thi3 treatment free to any distressed
wife, mother or sister who will write for it. Mrs.
Hawkins has means of her own and no charge
whatever is made for the treatment, because her
gTeat desire is that every woman who needs this
medicine will^rrite at once to her and get it.

V. SARAH KEMBLE SIDDONS.
1755-1531.
Sir Joshua Reynolds' magnificent por
trait of Mrs. Siddons as "The Tragic
Muse" is Interesting aside from its artis
tic value, because it recalls the gallantry
of the painter and the personality of his
subject. When the great actress came to
Sir Joshua's studio he took her by the
hand and ceremoniously escorted her to
the place generally occupied by his sit
ters: "Ascend your undisputed throne and
graciously bestow upon me some good
Idea of the Tragic Muse." Mrs. Siddons
complied with his request with such easy
grace that the delighted artist seized his
palette and, imploring: her not to change
her first attitude, painted her as
we see her to-day. Sir Joshua ' Re
ynolds seldom signed his pictures, but
In this instance he painted his
name upon the border of the robe
of the Tragic Muse and justified his ex
ceptional act to Mrs. Siddona by exclaim
ing: "I could not resist the opportunity
of sending my name down to posterity on
the hem of your garment."
In striking contrast to the social and
professional adulation of her maturer
years was the early life of Sarah Kemble.
Daughter of Roger Kemble, manager of a
company of strolling players, she was
born at the "Shoulder of Mutton," an inn
at Brecknock, South Wales. Notwith
standing his humble vocation Roger Kem
ble was well bred and of unquestioned in
tegrity, ingeniously described by his wife
as "the only gentleman Falstaff that I
have ever seen." Mrs. Kemble, also of
play-acting extraction, gave to her daugh
ter Sarah her striking beauty, her supple
and majestic figure, together with educa
tional advantages, especially in music, far
beyond her lowly station. As a child Sarah
was forced to follow the family vocation
and strive after that intrepid self-confi
dence which she gained with great diffi
culty in her maturity.
At 17 a musical attachment sprung up
between Sarah Kemble and a Mr. Sid
dons, an Indifferent actor in her father's
company of itinerants. This attachment
met with the stern disapproval of the im
perious Mrs. Kemble, who hastily exiled
her daughter to the companionship of a
country family. Thereupon the disconso
late Siddons "dropped off into poetry" and
sang to a sympathetic audience a metrical
account of the banishment of Phyllis from
the company of her bewailing Colin. Mr.
and Mrs. Kemble. although greatly exas
perated by these personal allusions, final
ly consented to the marriage at Coventry.
With the exception of his ill-judged poet
ical ebullition of bad taste Mr. Siddons
proved to be in every way commendable
âa model husband, a devoted father, a
satisfactory actor and an obliging cipher
in the household of genius.
Immediately after their marriage young
Mr. and Mrs. Siddons began acting at
Cheltenham and attracted the favorable
criticism of the aristocratic families of
the neighborhood. In some ways this pat
ronage, friendly and encouraging though
Â¦which she was to enact her part. "I
never," she writes, "from the besinr.in<
of the play to the end of It. once suffered
my dressing-room door to be closed, in
order ttfat my attention misht be con
stantly fixed on those distressing: events
which I could plainly hear were groins on
upon the stajre. the terrible fact 3 which
were to be represented by me."
Her stately manner In tragedy gradu
ally became habitual to her daily life and
was not always engaging to strangers.
Mrs. Thrale exclaimed upon first meeting
the renowned actress: "Why. this is a
leaden goddess we are all worshiping!
However, we shall soon gild It." Her
statuesque bearing was largely affected
by her study of antique sculpture. Once,
while touring in the provinces, she was
requested to buy a stucco bust so unlike
herself that she did not wonder that the
salesman failed to recognize the original.
Feeling that she could do better, she
studied sculpture In her leisure mo
ments and executed a bust of herself
which may be seen to-day in South Ken
sington. Her studies of marbles of an
tiquity served to heighten her statuesque
charm as Hermiohe In "The Winter's
Tale." She told Lord Lansdowne that
"the first thing that suggested to her the
mode of expressing intensity of feeling
was the position of some of the Egyptian
statues, with arms close down by the side
and the hands clenched."
Comparisons with Rachel, the great
French tragedienne, were Inevitable.
Those favored in beholding the art of
both actresses generally agreed that in
burning Intensity Rachel surpassed Mrs.
Siddons. especially in her rendering of
passion in its fiercer concentrations, while
the English artist retained pre-eminence
in finish, dignity and pathos. Although
occasionally accused of parsimony. Mrs.
Siddons never sank to the grasping ava
riclousness for which Rachel was so no
torious, and Dr. Johnson said of his coun
trywoman after one of his frequent vis
its: "Neither praise nor the love of
money, the two powerful corruptions of
mankind, seem to have depraved her."
For thirty years she charmed her audi
ences with her distinctive stage genius,
her rich, warm voice, and her sympa
thetic interpretations. Her spirited face
has been described by a contemporary as
"so thoroughly harmonized when quies
cent and so expressive when impassioned
that most people think her more beautiful
than she is." In ISI2 she took her leave
of the public in her great character of
Lady Macbeth, and reappeared on the
stage only in benefit performances. She
occasionally varied the irksome vacuity
of the remaining twenty years of her iife
by readings in public or before the royal
family, chiefly from Milton or Shakes
peare. Some have asserted that the Bi
ble. Shakespeare and Milton were the
only books which she knew comprehen
sively, and these she knew by heart. Al
though her Intellectuality lay strictly
along these lines, she doubtless enjoyed
a more varied reading In addition to this
exceptionally strong foundation. In 1522
she published a book called "The Story of
Our First Parents, Selected from Milton's
'Paradise Lost,' for the Use of Young
Persons." Her poetical compositions were
never fully published.
The latter part of her life was saddened

Nczi' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 16.â Whatever signlfl- '
cance attached to to-day's stock market was
cf a negative character. Trading in the ag
rr-pate was on a small scale and even at timt
was congested In a few of the specialties.
Third Avenue continued to absorb a large share
of attention and was the only stock on thjs
list with any considerable range In the price
fluctuation. After an early decline this stock
moved upward over 5 points and closed with
a net gain of 24- Sugar was active, but
phowt-d a comparatively narrow range and
ended the day wih a email net gain. People's
Gas more than retrieved an early decline and
raclfic Mail was notably weak. Otherwise the
dealings were email, price fluctuations narrow
and the list of stocks dealt in a short one.
That the general tone was flrm was probably
due to the fact that the bear traders bought
Ftorks to cover short contracts. There was no
t-vidence of any outside speculative demand,
but there was some Investment buying here
end there on a small scale. Probably the bears
Â«vn> induced to cover by the prospect that
to-morrow's bank statement may fall slightly
s-hort of b*-ing an weak as was feared. The
j, fw York sub-treasury made a small contribu
tion to-day to the cash resources of the banks
cf the routine transactions between them. This
Is the first time this has happened In over
thre* weeks and brings down the lomÂ»s by
th<Â« banks for the week on sub-treasury opera
tions to M.317.000. compared with $6,800,000 last
weÂ«"k. To-day's pain by the banks is due to
the disbursement on pensions. On the currency
movement by express to the interior a net
loss by the banks is Indicated of only about
J7M.0110. compared with $2,300,000. Without al-
Jowing for the movement by registered mail
the loss of the banks on all accounts is there
fore only a little over Ss.oiin.ooo. compared with
i.,ar!v Slf>,mXi.o(>o last week. The changes in
the loan account are largely guess work. Some
of the banks called loans during the week, but
on the other hand the borrowing of money to
l.uv Government bonds continued. The hard
enl'nc of New York exchanp* at Chicago is said
to be due to the transfer of funds to liquidate
loans contract*^ by Western banks for buying
Government bonds In New York. These doubt
lul elements In the outlook somewhat modified
the conviction of professional traders that the
surplus reserve* of the banks are certain to
be wiped out to-morrow. Money on call wÂ»s
In cood supply for roost of the day at from
4544 per cent, and the late flurry was ac
companied by rather palpable manipulation,
the rate quickly yielding under the offerings
brought out - But whatever may remain of the
mrplu* it Is certain to be 6mall. The impres
t-lon Is general, however, that to-morrow s
Â¦uatement will 6how the low water mark of
reserves and the process of replenishment will
begin to show effect next week.
Some of the dorn.ant hlph-grade bonds were
df-alt in at advancing prices. At other points
prices yielded. Total sales, par value, $2,0. d. OOO.

NEW YORK. March 16.â Bradstreet'B > to
morrow will say: Trade advices are as a whole
cheerful and the stretch of values Is apparently
unabated, though some soft spots still present
themselves. A permanent feature this' week
has been the increase In the strength of values
of farm products, nearly all the cereals, pork
products and cotton advancing, while materials
for manufacture and the products thereof have
generally remained, steady or unchanged. The
Government report on the quantity of corn In
farmers' hands showed a smaller than expected
supply and quite Â» an outbreak of speculative
Interest occurred, sympathized in by wheat
and both cereals reached : the highest point
touched on the crop of 1899. . Liquidations -on
the advance brought about some reaction in
prices, growing wheat crop advices proving
rather depressing as a whole and the statistical
position remaining . as bearish as -pointed out
in these columns last I week. : The . close finds
quotations' above those of a week ago. it
seems evident that the weather and the grow
ing crops will constitute price making features
for some time to 'come. . . -â¢
Manufacturers of shoes are busy and weather
conditions have rather favored the retailer by
enabling him to dispose Â¦ of some carrled-over
stocks. - : ?y*lifr<yrT*WViTTd*tiHf*W!CJÃff"t>!W
Copper has been .. stronger Â¦in : tone. : Lead,
after a break due to enlarged receipts, is firm,
but slightly lower than a week ago. r -
Wool la fairly steady, but manufacturers are
out of the market and concessions can be ob
tained though London advices are better. Â¦ -
Anthracite is lower, in keeping with the ad-
Ecu's are dearer. CheÂ«sÂ« is cheaper. Butter
is uncharged.
Poultry continues rather above thÂ« normal In,
price. Game will soon disappear. Meats ara
about thÂ« same.
New Strawberries have appeared in small
quantities. Asparagus. Rhubarb and Green
Peas are steadily becoming more plentiful.
Otherwise .there is nothing new in Fruits and

NDW YORK. March 16.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: An event like
the passage and formal enactment of the cur
rency bill, accompanied as It Is by the prom
ise of a considerable Increase In the national
circulation, le something which the stock mar
ket expected to celebrate by an exhibition of
decided bullishness. But. although the action
of Congress on the measure was certain for
some weeks past, there was no demonstration
of tl:ia kind based on It and this week the
market has been dull, professional and at times
Inclined to sag lower. The undertone is bullish
and there is a general feeling that speculation
will be materially benefited by the bill. When,
however, the market on last Saturday and Mon
day developed considerable strength, accompa
nied by extensive covering by short | Interests,
the movement was abruptly checked by the
rise of the call loan rate to 6 per cent. Notice
was thus served on the speculative commu
nity that it erred In disregarding the decrease
of the bank reserves and the reduction of the
surplus to slim proportions in Saturday's bank
statement. The showing In question merely
supplemented the statement!) for a series of
weeks past, all of them pointing to the fact
that preparations by banks for taking out cir
culation under the new law have Involved tho
purchase of a large amount 'of governments,
a considerable part of which is being tempo
rarily carried on loans at New York, , thereby
diminishing the extent of the accommodation
the banks can at the moment extend to I tho
stock market. It would, seem that this warn
ing wan not lost. For the balance of the week
the market was very dull, with a disposition
to sell oft on the certainty that to-morrow's
bank statement will be bad, perhaps to the
extent of wiping out the surplus reserve and
substituting a deficit, although relief Is prom
ised from the treasury's payment of premiums
on bonds deposited In exchange for new 2's
and from interior' banks of Â¦ funds to pay ' the
Government for bonds bought for circulation
purposes. Activity was confined to spots, and
a few specialties, notably Third Avenue, en
grossed the attention. of the- traders, while lit
tle attention was paid to the continued good
railroad earnings and the favorable reports
concerning Industrial properties. The dullness,
however, had Its benefits. The pressure on the
money market was relieved and call loans,
while firm, were generally held at 5 per cent
or !<>sk. Nor. while bear traders showed some
activity, was there any great display of confi
dence on their part, the prevalent feeling being
that when money relaxes prices would really
appreciate. The public, however, was con
spicuously inactive and the leading bulls showe,i
little or no disposition to do anything beyond
protecting their specialties to a certain ex
tent.

Harrison's circular says:
"During the week there have been the fol
lowing deliveries of coal: From WaÂ»hln,j*on.
seven arrivals, with 13,453 tons; from -British
Cclumbla. seven, with 21,770 tons; faro from
Oregon. S2O tons; one from Australia. 2300 tons;
total, 44,444 tons. These generous arrival* makt
the market easy, as the quantity consumed :Â«
fully 15,000 tons less than the amount received.
If this continues for a month longer, the now
empty yards will gradually accumulate a small
stock, and we shall a<ain begin to breathe eas
ily on the fuel question. The last Australian
mail added a number of new names to the
loading list, so that about six months hence we
may look for some relief from that source.
Under exlstlne circumstances there should ba
a very lengthy list of chartered vessels for San
Francisco from the colonies." judging from our
past experience: as in former years, shipown
ers were ever ready to accept 42.6s to 43s per
ton for the round voyate (Newcastle to San
Francisco with coal and San Francisco to Eu
rope with wheat), whereas, now they can read
ily secure 52.6s for the same voyage, and yet
appear reluctant to charter.
â¢â¢Honolulu coal requirements are diminishing
somÂ«what. and it now appears as if the quan
tity contracted for. and yet to be delivered,
may prove in excess of the demand. This will
necessarily divert Colonial tonnage in this
direction, and probably cause a reaction In
freights in fact there are offerings now on
the market at a decline from last week's
rulln* figures." *

Iron has been moved at concessions. By the

this week the entire production for the first

seems a strong one. ReportÃ of coming activity
in railroad building multiply, but It is possible
that a false construction. may be put upon tne
reports that 59,000 miles of new road are pro
jected. The heaviest mileage ever built was
In 1887, when less than 13.000 miles were con

NEW YORK. March 16.â R. O. Dun &. Co. s
Weekly" Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The new monetary act which was signed and
took' effect on Wednesday has not affected busi
ness, perceptibly, as yet. Designed as a barrier
against future harm it was by some expected
to have immediate influence through Provisions
regarding bank circulation. While %2,\OQ,WQ
will be added to the New York circulation the
increase thuÂ» far Indicated will be mainly in
terior, affecting the chief monetary centers
only by ' lessening reliance upon them when
more currency Is wanted. ,
The grain movement is fading In Importance.
Corn exports, have been in two weeks only
5,497,102 bushels, against 7,126.633 last year,
though prior to March 132,952,002 bushels were
exported, against 99,549,944 last year. The
wheat movement is falling behind rather less
than it has been In recent weeks, owing parti,
to large Pacific shipments. Atlantic exports
In two weeks have been 3.009,454 bushels, flour
included, against 6.229,478 last year, and Pa
cific exports 2.566,077 bushels, against 1.427.3.6
bushels last year. While Government esti
mates of wjieat In farmers' hands showed a
sufficient quantity with visible supply to meet
besides all home requirements as large foreign
demands as those of last year and yet leave n.
large surplus there Is no reason to expect that
last year's foreign demand will be equaled.
The price advanced 14c for the week and corn
advanced 14c. ":'
â¢ St. Louis efforts to excite new confidence In
higher prices for Iron have never had the de
sired effect. While various mrakets are called
stronger not a quotation has advanced, but
tank plates at Plttsburg are lower. Eastern
grey forge has sold there In considerable quan
tity at $20 60, against $21 for local forge, and
Southern No. l'foundry is selling here at $22 75.
against $23 50 for Northern No. 1. Bessemer
pig Is still held at $24 at valley mills, though
email lots are obtainable at Plttsburg at $24 50.
Large contracts are mentioned as in prospect,
but none Is clcsed except a structural contract
for the Government printing office. Much work
Is deferred because of the builders and ma
chinists' strike at Chicago and because of doubt
whether prices can be held with the output
exceeding consumption over one thousand tons
per day. Copper Is strong and a shade higher,
but large arrivals have caused some decline In
tin.
It Is not strange that higher prices have
been asked for most cotton goods with the
markets for raw cotton higher than they have
been since January 10, 1593, and the break In
prices did not go far enough to change the
situation. With print cloths at 34c. against
4.06 c early in 1893. standard and Southern sheet-
Ings ViÂ®4c lower and ginghams lc lower than
In 1893 the mills would be asking more if they
had not taken large supplies of cotton before
the rise In February. The disposition to order
goods ahead is much affected with much doubt
about price, and consumption would probably
be affected If present prices were to continue.
Sales of wool have been only 7,332.700 pounds
In two weeks. Manufacturers have such sup
plies that they buy only to piece out for special
wants, and the best dealers report that a yield
ing of lc would be required In order to effect
sales. Quotations are really nominal for lack
of transactions. The mills are still producing
great quantities of goodÃ without buying wool.
Prices of leading goods have not declined, but
others, both plain and fancy, are somewhat
weaker. - ... .
The yielding In satin leather haÂ« led to con
siderable sales of men's shoes at 2%c decline,
but the concessions recently made in boots by
makers who held old stock of leather are now
refused, and it is claimed that transactions In
hemlock and oak sole have been larger than
at any time since November. McÂ»t of the
makers are receiving very slender orders. The
market for hides at Chicago Is again weaker,
though the decline Is not large.
Failures for the week have been 198 in the
United States, against IS9 last year, and 23 In
Canada, against 30 last year.

POSTTJM CEBEAI*
GROCER AND COFFEE
Helped Out of Trouble by Postum
Cereal Coffee.
"The daily use of coffee caused indi-
gestion to both myself and family, my
husband being the worst affected; an
hour or so after using coffee, the form
of indigestion called belching or gas
rising, was shown, often accompanied
by pain and sick stomach. We had
heard of the merits of Postum Food
Coffee and concluded to try it. We were
much pleased with the results and are
now using Postum in preference to any
other hot drink. The sick feelings that
used to come from coffee drinking have
disappeared.
"I have known of several who de-
clared that Postura was weak and in-
sipid, after the first trial". I always dis-
cover that in such cases the Postum
Coffee has been boiled about the same
length of time as for coffee, which is
not half enough- I have taken pains to
explain to such people that if they
would use four heaping teaspoons to the
pint of water, let it stand on the stove
until the real bubbling begins, then note
the time by the clock and allow it to boil
full 15 minutes from that time, stirring
down occasionally, it would produce a
rich, clear, deep brown color, with a
fine, crisp taste.
"Mr. H. H. Bidwcll of Springfield.
Mo., who had been a user of coffee for
vcar's. concluded that his indigestion
vvas caused by coffee drinking. _He tried
Postum and is now a great friend and
advocate of it, both for young and old.
Mr. Dan Trogden, one of Green Coun-
ty's leading farmers, had a somewhat
similar experience. My husband is a
grocer and says that the sales of Pos-
tum are steadily increasing as it be-
comes more and favorably known. Mrs.
Fred Lippman, Springfield. Mo."

Native Sons Make Preliminary Ar
rangements for a Grand Celebra
tion in September Next.
A meeting of the Joint 9th of September
committee of the Native Sons was "held
last night in Shasta Hall. Native Sons'
building. James D. Phelan of Pacific Par
lor presided.
James L. Gallagher of the committee on
order of business presented a report sug
gesting the designation of sub-commit
tees and number of members for each to
carry on the work as follows:
Auditing. hallÂ« and headquarters, hotels and
accommodations. entertainment, excursions,
parade, music, decorations, carriages and local
transportation, press, bulletins, souvenir, grand
ball, badges and regalias, printing, literary
exercises, regatta, coherence with other or
ganizations, reception, finance, invitation.
The committee suggested that there be
a fchort, eharp, energetic and vigorous ef
fort on behalf of the celebration, and that
no action be taken until after the ad
journment of the Grand Parlor. The re
port was adopted and the several commit
tees will be named later on.
D. A. Ryan of the committee to which
was referred a proposition by one Neill to
get up a baseball tournament under the
auspices of the Native Sons, who should
receive 30 per cent of the gross receipts,
less incidentals, presented a report, which
on motion to adopt was lost.
The president announced that he had
received a letter from Steve V. Costello
suggesting that if the dragon festival
which the Chinese are to have could . be
postponed until the 9th of September It
would be an attractive feature of the pro
cession.
D. A. Ryan thought that it would be but
a poor showing on the part of the Native
Sons for what they had done In fifty
years, and he suggested that the commit
tee of five 'which it had been proposed
should be appointed to consider the mat
ter "be killed on the spot," and the com
mittee was killed. :..-â¢;. v>'- =--<â¢*
A member requested the president to
ask the committee to attend the presenta
tion by General Shatter of the historic
cannon to the city next Wednesday, and
the president, whose mind wandered from
the meeting in which he was. expressed
the hope "that the committee of one hun
dred" would attend the presentation, but
the laugh that followed this announce
ment reminded him of his error and he
changed the announcement to "the com
mittee of 1900."
The committee will secure the Mechan

structed to make arrangements to that

WILCOX'S MEMORY GOOD.
Three Shots Were , Fired , Into His
Wife's Body, as He Stated.
Bpeoial IMspatch'toTlie Call.
V SANTA - ROSA. March 15.â Although
George' F. Wllcox, the ; wife : murderer,
claims to have been insane when: he com
mitted his brutal deed and although he
says that as soon as he fired the first shot
Into his wife's prostrate body he com
pletely i lost , : himself , and has no distinct
recollection of what followed, he certainly
recalled some of the details of the affair
very clearly. This was proved to-day
when the body of his victim was exhumed
and examined by the authorities. Â¦ -
At his preliminary hearing Wilcox stated
that he hred three times, -air of the shots
taking effect. He said the first bullet en
tered his wife's head back of her left ear,
the second struck her in the left eye and
the third shot' was fired while the revolver
was held â¢ close to the prostrate woman's
cheek. -The testimony introduced at. the
Coroner's Inquest was that but one bullet
had struck the victim and that had lodged
In - her - head. .The conflicting Â¦ statements
led to the body being exhumed to-day, for
examination as stated. /
/ The examination took place at Kelsey
ville, where Mrs. -Wllcox was buried last
Sunday. Sheriff Frank P. Grace, Assistant
District* Attorney J. P. ; Berry. Dr. P. A.
Meneray and Court Reporter H. A. Scott
of this city . were present. A careful ex
amination , of ) the ; body a revealed the fact
that Wllcox's story of the shooting:, as far
as the effect of the gunshot wounds were
concerned,- was correct In every detail.
One bullet entered the -.back' of. the head
just Â¦ behind " the left . ear, another struck
the left eye and the third penetrated . the
center of the left s cheek. 'Powder burns
plainly discernible upon I the face showed
that .the last shot had been fired at close

to his first effort to quell secession. Then
the major married and settled down to
thÂ» raising of a large family, which he
did successfully, and came to California.
Here secession came into his life from all
directions. First it was a political seces
sion. Major Howe had been an earnest
Republican, like most old soldiers, but
when he settled in the Sonoma Valley
he seceded from the Republican party and
became the first Populist candidate for
Congress in that district many years ago.
Following that, the major came to Oak
land, and during the : Presidential cam
paign of four years ago he became quite
excited over the prospect of the election,
and withdrawing from Oakland to a small
island in the Sacramento River' he an
nounced his secession from the United
States of America. He raised his own
flag over his island and declared that he
would never set foot in the United States
of America as long as Hanna was in the
Senate. Secession became uncomfortable"
after about three weeks of experiment,
and the major came back under the flag.
Troubled Family and the Cause of Its .Woes.
OAKLAND, March 16. â A "solar
biologist" . has caused a final
secession in the family of Major
W. O. Howe of this city, and has
resulted In a divorce suit being filed by
the major against the wife of his bosom.
The "solar biologist" is W. V. Durbin,
who Ib scarcely more than the age of
Mrs. Howe's oldest son, yet he has won
the heart of a mother 60 years of age,
with large experience In the family line,
and they have disappeared Into the great
unknown, leaving Major Howe to nurse
this latest case of secession In his fam
ily and file a divorce suit after twenty
five years of married life.
Secession has been a part and parcel
of the life of Major W. O. Howe. When
the Southern States tried to secede from
the Union Major Howe enlisted in the
northern cause, and fought through the
war with honor to himself and success
"When Mrs. W. O. Howe decided to se
cede from the Howe family things took
on a different complexion, and now the
major wants to be avenged by the courts,
and he demands a divorce. ; â¢
"Professor" W. V. Durbln came into
Major Howe's life some months ago Â¦when
he appeared at the Howe printing office
and wanted Borne, job work done in the
interests of the science of "solar biol
oey," of which he was the "professor."
The major liked the "solar biologist" and
the "solar biologist" liked the major's
wife, and that was how it all came about.
The major took the "solar biologist" to
his home, and, as the complaint filed by
thj major now asserts, the "solar biolo
gist" took the home away with him.
"I don't know what a 'solar biologist*
is." said Major Howe, "but I know that
that fellow was a fraud. He came Into
my life and eloped with my wife and
took away one of my children, and if that
Is a 'solar biologist I would advise the
rest of the community to keep away from
him." " â¢

WOLCOTT LOST
THROUGH ERROR
OF THE PILOT
Mining Expert Benjamin's
Thrilling Description
of the Wreck.
. ?
Extraordinary Heroism of a Fireman
and the Cowardice of a Passen
ger â Cast Away, on a Nar
row Beach.
Edward H. Benjamin, the well-known
mining expert, .who' was a passenger on
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
steamer Wolcott when that -unfortunate
vesser was . wrecked on Kadlak Island,
Alaska, on the night of January 31, Is at
his home in Oakland, having arrived from
Seattle on the Oregon express last night.
George C. Mayon and wife, who were also
in the wreck, were passengers on the train
that brought Mr. Benjamin from th-j
north, and are now stopping with Mrs.
Mayon'B parents/who reside in Oakland.
Mr. Benjamin was met at Port Costa
by his wife, and several friends were in
waiting at the Sixteenth-street station to
greet him as he stepped off the train and
to congratulate him on his miraculous es
cape from almost certain death. The pub
lished reports of the disaster to the Wol
cott give but a meager idea of the ter
rifying experiences through which the
passengers and crew of the vessel passed
from the time the ship struck the hidden
rocks until the final rescue by the steamer
Excelsior. The officers and crew ot the
doomed ship displayed remarkable hero
ism under moÃt trying circumstances, in
glaring contrast to the abject cowardice
exhibited by one of the passengers. Dep
uty United States Maoshal L. L. Bowers
of Unger, who was on his way to Sitka In
charge of three Federal prisoners.
It is said that not only did this creature
leave his prisoners locked up in a room to
die like rats in a trap unless they could
force their way out, but he was the first
man over the side of the ship when the
boats were finally cleared away, pushing
Mrs. Mayon aside in his frantic endeavors
to make sure of saving his carcass. This
act of brutal cowardice nearly cost the
deputy marshal his life, for the o'her
passengers and the officers of the jhip
were so incensed that nothing but the ab
solute necessity of devoting every second
to saving their own lives prevented sum
mary justice being meted out to him.
The hero of the occasion, according to
Mr." Benjamin, was the fireman, an old
man-o'-warsman named Charles A. El
rick. Elrlck waa a gunner on the Trenton
when that warship was wrecked at Apia,
Samoa, and he snipped on the Wolcott
under the name of Rowell. Although he
had changed his name the man was there.
Elrlck shoveled coal Into the furnaces of
the sinking whaler, until the water rose
to his shoulders, in order to keep up steam
until the doomed vessel could be beached.
At last the water was so high that it was
useless for him to remain longer at his
post, but before reporting off to Engineer
Mbrriss he made one final effort, diving
under the water to secure a last shovelful
of coal. The bulldog courage that caused
him to remain at his post was not with
out reward, however, for as the fires un
der the boilers went out the keel of tho
vessel grated on the sandy bottom a few
hundred yards from the shore.
"I never want another such experience,
said Mr. Benjamin last night. "It was
God's will that we should be saved or. I
would not be here now. The afternoon of
January 31 was â¢ perfect. The ' air was
balmy and the sea as smooth as glass. .
"We passed Karluk heads at 9:30 p. m.
and were headed for Unyak Bay, twenty
two miles distant. Our course lay past
Cape Unyak, and although the night was
dark, the weather was clear and no dan
ger was apprehended. A strong north
west wind sprang up and when we re
tired to our bunks at 10 o'clock It was
blowing pretty strong and there was quite
a sea on. Captain Snow went to his state
room at 10:30, leaving the ship in charge
of Pilot Keen, and an hour later we were
on the rocks. It appears the pilot thought
he saw the lights of the Pacific Steam
Whaling Company's cannery, which is
located on Unyak Bay, and headed the
vessel in shore. In view of the fact that
the log showed we had made >but nine
miles since passing Karluk heads and the
distance to the entrance of the bay was
eighteen miles, the action of the pilot ap
pears inexecusable, but as I am not a
navigator I will not attempt to. pass judg
ment. The vessel first struck on the rocks
at the bow. A second later a wave raised
her and carrying her forward thirty feet
or so dropped her on the rock amidships.
The ship was again lifted and swept for
ward by the waves until her stem crashed
against the rocks. By thiÂ« time we were
all on deck and knew the ship was
doomed. The wind had developed into a
gale, and It was Impossible to launch the
boats. Captain Snow backed the vessel
off the rocks, and crowding on all steam
headed the steamer out to sea until she
rounded Cape Unyak, and then turned
her prow toward the shore. Our only
hope was to beach her inside the point
where the water was not quite so rough.
It was an anxious time, and we would
never have reached shore alive but for
the heroism of Fireman Elrlck and the
coolness of Engineer Theodore Morrlss,
who. by the way, is a San Francisco man.
. "The boats were finally cleared away,
and the passengers conveyed safely to
shore followed by the crew. We landed
on a "little strip of beach scarcely fifty
feet wide at 'the foot of gigantic perpen
dicular cliffs 500 feet high. Between the
foot of the cliffs and the water there was
about fifteen feet of beach at low tide,
and fortunately the tide was out when
we landed. At high water the beach was
overflowed, but there was a narrow gorge
between the cliffs extending inland and
packed with snow. This gorge was
Ecarcelv twenty feet wide, but ,lt waa
our salvation. When the tide came In
we scrambled up on this snow, and when
it was out: we camped on the beach. A
drizzly rain fell continually, but fortu
nately it ws warm, otherwise we would
have perished." . .
The party succeeded In getting plenty of
supplies ashore and after three days the*
sea subsided somewhat and they made
their way in the small boats to the can
nery, nine miles distant, where they were
found by the Excelsior on February 27.
Mr. Beniamln has only words of praise
for Captain Snow, J. H. Rand and E. B.
Wood first and second mates of the Wol
cott, for their coolness, skill and bravery.
Captain Snow will arrive In San Fran
cisco to-day.
SECESSION AND A "SOLAR BIOLOGIST".
BROKE UP THE FAMILY OF MAJOR HOWE
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY; MARCH 17, 1900.
NIPPON OFFICERS
WILL HAVE BIG
BILL TO SETTLE
Repudiating Policies May
Prove to Be
Costly.
Demand Will Be Made Upon Them
and Suits ard Posting Are
Among the Possi
bilities.
The Nippon Marine Insurance Company
with headquarters In Japan, may be post
al in all part* of the world unless the
right thing be dene by the management
of that corporation. This statement was
made yesterday by George A. Newhall,
I acifie Coast agent. The sudden repudia
tion by the company, without notice of
the policies written in this city will not
result in loss to the policy holders if the
ag-eney of Mr. Newhall. can prevent it.
The Insured property is afloat and disas
ter may have taken place in some in
etance before any knowledge of the action
of the Japanese at the head of the Nld
pon company was had; but all pol
icy holders have now been notified of
what has taken place. They have ac
cordingly been given a chance to reinsure
ar.d the work of taking out new policies
went oh steadily yesterday. Nearly all
the holders of policies in the Japanese
company are near or in San Francisco,
vhlch permitted them to take action
tarly.
.. Al ' Premium* have been returned by
the Newhall agency ar.d. in addition, the
turn of $50} was given as a contribution
yesterday to those Interested.
The Japanese company is solvent upon
T 2 e . Rowing made, having a gold surplus
of J46S^>9. There is nothing known here
to account for the action taken except
that the management has been changed.
Tne Newhall agency is continued and the
agents are asked to write new business.
The rates could not have been the rea
son for the repudiation of the policies al
ready written, because they are the same
rates that are obtained In other places by
the company. A cablegram has been sent
to the officers setting forth that the poli
cies written here amount to $350,009 and
that the premiums amount to 110.000; also
that the company will be held responsible.
In addition to this the Japanese company
has a liability of some size for the ex
penses of the agency here. This claim
will be put in with the statement to be
forwarded for the consideration by the
Japanese.
If the company fails to pay the legiti
mate charges against It suit will be
brought in Japan and tbe company will be
posted abroad, in Europe and elsewhere,
wherever the Newhall agency has corre
spondents. A meeting of the holders of
policies in this city was held yesterday,
which was attended by George A, New
hall. A committee of three â Messrs. Har
rison of Harrison & Baggs, Livingston
Smith and Mr. Roeenthal of the Swiss
Marine Insurance Company â was appoint
ed to consider- the situation.

To-day the Irish people of this city and
their children will honor in services pa
triotic and sacred the memory of. lreland's
patron saintâ St. Patrick. This celebra
tion' is perhaps more significant than any
other of its kind held by the Irish people
in ; a generation and the ceremonies, not
alone in this city but all over the world,
will be of commensurate dignity. The
day will be spent as a festival of feasting
and song, of praise, prayer," devotion and
recreation. For in the last few months
great dignities and triumphs have come
to representatives of the Irish race. Irish
soldiers have proved their valor on the
battlefields of South Africa and by per
mission of their Queen they are weaflng
the shamrock on their breasts. In honor,
too. of their victories in war the green
flag with the golden harp is -floating over
the mansion of the Lord Mayor of Lon
don. Â¦ , .
Linked with the patriotic effusions of
the Irish people of this city will be a
tribute to the Boers, for whose benefit the
proceeds of two monster shows, this after
noon-and evening. : will _be given to the
Boer Red Cross Society. .It means the
joining of hands of the Irish people in
this city and the beleaguered Boers fight
ing against odds for liberty and home.
Both entertainments will be held at Wood

BITUMINOUS PAVEMENT
ON CHINATOWN STREETS
Mayor Recommends It to the Board
of Public Works as a Measure
of Health..-
The Mayor yesterday sent the following
self-explanatory letter, to Colonel Mendell,
president of the Board of Public Works:
As a measure of cleanliness and health I be-
UÂ«-ve that Chinatown should be paved with bi
tuminous' rock. The present roadway is no
doubt accepted and under ordinary circum
stances the charge would'be upon the city, but
property owners on accepted streets have con
tributed one-half the cost of repavlng under the
influence of the Merchants' Association. In the
matter of Chinatown, I think the property own
ers oucht to be made to bear the whole ex
pense, and as a sanitary measure they will be
compelled to clean up their premises and they
might, if a systematic request Is made, agree
to pave the streets and alleys. As disease is
principally carried, perhaps. In the germ-laden
dust, a hard paved and watered roadway In
Chinatown would be a sanitary measure of first
importance. Â¦ . â¢
In your estimate for the coming year I would
suggest that you include the repair of liush
street and the laying of modern pavements on
Van Ness avenue where such do not now ex
ist, and on many of the streets of the down
town districts, on some of which the property
owners are willing to bear; one-half : the ex

LIEUTENANT COCKE
MUST BE SOBERED UP
Officer of the First Tennessee Volun
teers Arrested on Charge of
Drunkenness.
Lieutenant Cocke, who claims to be a
second lieutenant in the Thirty-seventh
Volunteer Infantry and who served In
Company D, First Tennessee Volunteers,
was arrested at the ' Presidio Thursday
evening and charged with drunkenness.
When Cocke appeared before Judge- Mo
gan yesterday morning he was in such a
dazed condition from his protracted spree
that the Judge continued- the case till this
morning. Cocke was sent to the Receiv
ing Hospital to be sobered up.
Cocke is the eldest son of one of the
prominent Tennessee families. According
to his story he served with honor with the
First Tennessee in Manila and was twice
wounded in action. From Â¦ his Tennessee
regiment he claims to have been trans
ferred to the Thirty-seventh Volunteer In
fantry, n<jw stationed In Manila. He came
up on the City of Peking January 24 on a
sick furlough.
While in the hospital Cocke told a fanci
ful tale of how, on Â¦ his first visit here,
while stationed with his regiment at
Camp Merritt, he met, and, loved Daisy
Bishop, an actress, and Â¦â finally became
engaged to her. But Cocke discovered that
Daisy was engaged to three other fellows
and so he broke off his engagement to the
fickle fair one. â¢ = â¢
Cocke, however.- would, not admit that
love for Daisy drove him to drink. "It's
the wound In my side." he said. "I took
whisky to drown the pain."

OPENLY DEFYING
CITY ORDINANCE
Board of Health Winks at
Continued Violation of
the Law.
Filth and Disease Germs Are Daily
Sifted Upon the Public Streets
Without Official Inter
ference.
There is great public sentiment back of
the demand that the scavengers' carts
used in the public streets be so employed
as not to endanger the public health.
Merchants, bacteriologists and physicians
said yesterday that there Is danger in hav
ing the carts handled as they are now.
Merchants assert that their stocks are
damaged by the vile, bacteria-breeding
dirt that is blown from the tops of the
uncovered loads. There Is no dissent from
the opinion that health is endangered.
It appears that the Phelanized Board of
Health Is permitting constant violation of
the law, which provides for a heavy cover
to be tightly fastened on the carts or ve
hicles at all times when the owner or
driver Is not collecting or depositing the
general refuse. This ordinance was ap
proved by Mayor Phelan on Judy 13, !Â«â¢>.
The Mayor therefore must knÂ«w the law.
Presumably the Board of Health has
knowledge of the health ordinances. It is
notorious that the carts used in carrying
the greater part of the refuse have nt
covers attached to them. They move
about the city streets covered with only
coarse cloth, if covered at all.
While the carts stand in front of stores,
schoolhouses or residences the unsavory
contents are blown about by every pass

THREE UNFORTUNATES
DESTROY THEIR LIVES
CUT A DASH OH
MONEY HE GOT
BY BORROWING
Clarence E. Young Starts
Off Wrong on His Ar
rival Here.
â¢Accused of Beating His Hotel and
Slaking His Lady Guests Stand
the Expenses of His lav
ish Hospitality.
Clarence E. Young, a recent arrival
from the East, Is really a good sort of a
fellow, but his failing Is that he desires to
"swell it" on other people's money and
that he has not got into serious trouble
Is attributed to the good-nature of the
"good things" he has struck up to date. -
Young arrived here some few weeks ago.
He came on the steamer from Los An
geles, and during the trip managed to in
gratiate himself Into the good graces of
a Mrs. Higgersonof Riverside, 111., who
was traveling for pleasure, accompanied
by her daughter, Sirs liider. Young ac
companied the ladie3 ashore and took
rooms aC the same hostelry at which they
put up, the St. Nicholas. The ladles reg
lÃtered riist and Young afterward. While
he was waiting for the ladies to inscribe
their names on the register he hypnotized
the clerk and obtained a loan of *o. Inls
was only the beginning. Shortly after
dinner tie obtained another live, and re
peated the operation again before retiring
lor the night. The next evening he in
vited nu steamer acquaintances to tour
Chinatown as his guebts. They accepted,
and had an exceedingly enjoyable time,
which cost Young considerable. He did
not mind, for he merely borrowed a roll
from his guests and took them to supper
on the change. â¢ â¢ â¢;
This settled him with the ladies, who left
shortly after for their home in the East,
lighter in pocket but enriched beyond
computation by the wealth of experience
that had come to them through their
friendship with Clarence.
Young continued to reside at the St.
Nicholas for some time after the depart
ure of his steamer friends. He wore the
most fashionable clothes, smoked the best
tobacco and wasÂ« gentlemanly, affable and
polishedâ in fact, he possessed everything
needful but money. But others had that,
and he borrowed at will.
He represented himself as a former law
partner of Senator Daniel of Virginia and
spoke of the great men of the nation as
though he had been accustomed to meet
ing them on a footing of common inti
macy. He displayed a letter bearing the
signature of Ferdinand Q. Peck of Chi
cago and claimed it was an introduction
from that gentleman to M. H. de Young
of this city. On the strength of these rep
resentations he met many of San Fran
cisco's best people and was entertained at
various clubs, among others being given
a visitor's card to the Union League. All
this time he had kept up his persistent
borrowing, taking anything he could get,
from whoever would loan it to him.
Finally he attempted to have his checks
Indorsed for acceptance at the banks, and
there he came to grief.
The hotel people took charge of his
trunk and compelled him to leave the
house, refusing him further credit declin
ing to restore his belongings to him until
he had made good the money he had bor
rowed from the hostelry and had settled
for the entertainment he had enjoyed.
Some of the acquaintances he had made
and who had been approached by him to
p.ut their names to his paper also became
suspicious and wrote to Senator Daniel,
asking information concerning his part
ner. The reply they received was any
thing but complimentary to Young. The
Senator stated that such a fellow had
once been employed by i:im as a clerk, but
that ho was no good and that no confi
dence was to be placed in his stories.
Young recently secured a position as a
reporter on a morning paper, where he Is
now employed.
Young comes from one of the best fam
ilies of the South. He Is good-looking,
well educated and Intelligent and of ex
cellent address. ,

Patent Fire Escape
on a Wall Adjoin
ing the Baldwin
Ruins Breaks
Down With
Startling Results.
?
AN experiment with a novel
fire-escape on the wall of
the building adjoining the
Baldwin ruins on Market
street nearly caused the death of
two people yesterday afternoon.
The Inventor was manipulating his
machine when the accident . oc
curred. By the eccentric operation
of the machine two wrought iron
balls used as its governors were de
tached and hurled with - terrific
force, one upward and the other
downward. The , former sailed
through the air' for a 1a 1 distance of
350 feet, striking the sign over the
California Cafe on Powell street
and punching holes in It. The ball
that- took the downward path
grazed the head of a laborer, Hugh
Cunningham, working in the ruins.
, For an hour before the accident
the contrivance worked smoothly
and successfully. It Is a cage much
after the fashion of those used In
mines. Two small boys, whose cu
riosity exceeded their discretion,
were the human part of the show
for a time, but they luckily escaped
the accident. The machine is auto
matic. All the escaping party need
to do is to get in the cage/and re
leasing a brake he goes to the bot
tom like a bird dropping to earth.
| But the machine was played once
too often. : After a miscue another
trip was attempted, but the gear-
Ing was worn out and the support-
Ing rod snapped, releasing the balls,
that might have cut off the life of
several people. The ball that struck
the sign over the cafe caused much
excitement on account lof the re
port, and a large crowd gathered
on . the " ' streets. . One ' of the by
standers carried away the Iron ball
as a souvenir, to the chagrin of the
Inventor. X ' v^: Â¦ :
