LONDON, March 15.â The British flag flies over the presidency in Bloemfontein, in which building
Lord Roberts and his staff passed last night. The keys were surrendered in due form to the com
mander in chief by the officials. The Free State and Transvaal burghers had withdrawn from the
neighborhood and the British troops received a welcome from the inhabitants. These events, the
result of Lord Roberts' advance on the town Tuesday, were made public in London soon after 9
o'clock last night. While it was expected, the news was received with great rejoicing at the clubs
and theaters. In the restaurants corks popped in lively fashion and toasts were drunk to Lord
Roberts' health with the hope that he would soon supplement the taking of the Free State capital
by the capture of Pretoria/ Mr. Steyn, "late President of the Free State," to quote Roberts, has re
tired north to Winburg or Kroonstadt. It is probable that the army of 12,000 burghers with eight
een guns has followed him.
The general opinion this morning in the Continental, as well as the London press, is that the
Free Staters have practically thrown up the sponge. It is thought likely that a rear guard action
will be fought to Kroonstadt by the irreconcilable of the Free State and Transvaalers; that then a
retirement will be made from the Free State and Natal upon the line of the Vaal, where there is
sure to be serious fighting. Lord Roberts is not likely to lose much time in providing a provisional
government to administer the affairs of the Free State.
General White is considered the best man to take hold of affairs. The commander in chief
can now turn his attention to the south of the Free State, where Clements, Gatacre and Brabant
have been holding the south bank of the Orange River, awaiting an order to push back the Boers.
The latter are now in a bad position between them and Roberts' army. No movement of any impor
tance was reported in that section yesterday, but a concerted advance will probably begin immedi
ately.
The Dutch rebellion in the northwest of Cape Colony appears to be collapsing. Kitchener
is directing operations and pouring British troops into the district, while there appears to be a
serious quarrel between the rebels and Free Staters, each accusing the other of treachery and de
ceit and threatening to shoot each other.
Though rumors of the relief of Mafeking are plentiful, there is no definite news. Every hour
the condition of Baden-Powell's little force is becoming more desperate.

UNCLE SAM'S STAND REGARDING INTERVENTION.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. March 14â It is rather expected by the adminis
tration that after the lapse of a short time the Transvaal will make another effort to negotiate peace, but until Great
Britain shows a disposition to accept the President's good offices this Government will take no action other than to trans
mit any messages that it may receive. Presidents Kruger and Steyn, in asking the President to use his good offices singling
this Government out for the purpose. Indicates that they are thoroughly acquainted with the European situation and
unrt^rstand that help cannot be expected from that quarter until the United States first indicates its willingness to act The
fact that the President expressed to Lord Salisbury his wllllngnei* to be of any assistance to bring about peace was a mat
ter pf considerable comment In diplomatic circles to-day, but it was generally stated that the expression would produce no
change in the attitude of Europe, and it Is the general consensus of opinion that beforo Europe can act the United States
must go further than it has done. *
The authorities are very much gratified at the way in which the British Government responded to the President's inti
mation that his good offices were at the disposal of the British Government, the reply being courteous, though a distinct
declination. Officials called attention to-day to the fact that the dispatch from . Pretoria did not request Great Britain to
allow this Government to "mediate," but to "Intervene." The latter is, of course, out of the question. The President will
do no mnire than to use his good offices.
Mr. White's dispatch containing Lord Salisbury's answer to his representations was received last night and was to-day
transmitted to Pretoria. The officials say that it closes the incident. It Is not likely that the President will feel' that he
has any right to answer at this time the Allen resolution adopted by the Senate, calling for all papers in the possession
of the State Department relative to mediation, as. the officials hold that the dispatches they have received are not the
property of the United States, but of the South African republic.
LONT>ON, March 15.â A dispatch to the Daily Chronicle from Bloemfontein. dated Tuesday evening, March 13, says*
"Bloemfontein surrendered at 10 o'clock to-day. It was occupied at noon. President Steyn, with a majority of "tho
fighting burghers, has fled northward. General French was within five miles of the place at 5 o'clock Monday afternoon.
He sent a eummons into the town, threatening to bombard unless It surrendered by 4a. m. Tuesday. A white flag was
hoisted Tuesday morning and a deputation of the Town Council, with Mayor Kellner, came out to meet Lord Roberts at
Epitz Kop. five miles south of the town, making a formal surrender of the place. Lord Roberts made p. state entry at noon
He received a tremendous ovation. After visiting the public buildings he went to the official residence of the President
followed by a cheering crowd, who waved the British flag and sang the British national anthem. They were in a condition
of frenzied excitement. On Monday afternoon, previous to the surrender, there had been a little sniping and shelling, but
the enemy retired. .. " '-'--" -.
"Lord Roberts has his headquarters at the President's house, and there are many of the British wounded in the build
ing. The railway Is not Injured." ;"-Â¦'-;Â¦ Kt^7 "-.
BRITISH COMMANDER'S ENTRY INTO FREE STATE CAPITAL
RAPID AND SUCCESSFUL WORK OF LORD "BOBS."
LONDON. March 15. â The first half of the campaign is over. Lord Roberts arrived at Modder River on February 9.
He entered Bloemfontein on March 13. Thus in little over a month he has effected the relief of Klmberley and Ladysmlth!
the capture of General Cronje's forces and the hoisting of the flag In the capital 'of the Free State. All this has been ac
complished with comparatively trifling losses. It is email wonder that he is the hero of the hour in England. AH the news
papers eulogize him and congratulate the country. They talk of the Free State as having passed out of existence, as being
now one of the shadows of history-
It is not doubted that there may be heavy fighting, but the genius of Lord Roberts is looked to for victory over all
difficulties. His grim reference? to the "late" President Steyn is understood to show that there shall be no ambiguity as to
the position assumed toward the republics.
The fact that Mr. Frazer. late chairman of the Free State Raad and leader of the opposition to Mr. Steyn, came with
the deputation to surrender the keys is regarded as extremely significant of considerable difference of opinion among the
Free Staters regarding the war. It is said that President Kruger hates Mr. Frazer on account of his sympathy with the
outlanders. The demonstrations of#the Bloemfontein inhabitants are also regarded as a good augury, for the future of
British supremacy.
It is interesting, in connection with the rapid advance of ' Lord Roberts, to learn that the Russian military attache with
the Boers who were captured by the British Eent the following telegram to the Czar: "I am perfectly amazed at the energy
In action and the endurance of the. British infantry. I need say no more." There is still no news as to whether Lord Roberts
has captured any rolling stock. If he has not yet. then he will be obliged to wait until the repairing, of the bridges over
the Orange River enables him to bring rolling stock up. .
The British continue pressing their advance on the Orange River. The Boers still hold Bethulie bridge, on the north
Bide of the stream, but their trenches are dominated by the British artillery. Heavy firing is in progress and there has
been some skirmishing.
ROBERTS REPORTS THE OCCUPATION OF BLOEMFONTEIN.
LONDON, March 14â 9 p. m.â lt is officially announced that Lord Roberts, has occupied Bloemfontein and ' that the
British flag is flying from the top of the Capitol. The following Is the text of Lord Roberts' dispatch to the War Office an
nouncing Ms occupation of Bloemfontein: - - '
BLOEMFONTEIN, March 13, Bp. m.â By the help of God and the bravery of her Majesty's soldiers
the troops under my command have taken possession of Bloemfontein. The British flag now flies over the Pres
idency, evacuated last evening- by Mr. Steyn, late President of the Orange Free State. Mr. Fraser, member of
the late Executive Government; the Mayor, the secretary to the late Governor, the Landrost and other offi
cials met me two miles from the town and presented me with the keys of the public offices.
The enemy has withdrawn from the neighborhood and all seems quiet. The inhabitants of Bloem
fontein gave the troops a cordial welcome.
The above dispatch, though dated Tuesday, was not received at the War Office until 7:30 p. m. Wednesday. It was
made public a few minutes before S o'clock. The delay is attributed to the field telegraphs not being connected with Bloem
fontein on Tuesday evening.
KIPLING WRITES OF

Need Swamp-Root.
65TH POLICE PRECINCT.
Or. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y. Greater New York. Nov. n, 1899.
, GENTLEMEN: "s?Â£Â£ . â¢j ' ' /.
In justice to you, 1 feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt
of the sample bottle of Swamp-Root you so kindly sent me. 1 had been out of health for the past
five y?ars with kidney and bladder trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. ' They would re-
lieve me for the time being, but the old complaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a sam-
ple bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world of good. Since then 1 have taken eight small
bottles bought at my drug store, and 1 consider m/self perfectly cured. It seemed as though my back
would break in two after stooping. Ido not ' have to get up during the night to urinate as I formerly did,:
three or four times a night, but now sleep the sleep of peace. My back is all right again, and in every
'vay lam a new man. Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-Root. They, like myself, can-
not say too much in praise of it. It is a boon to mankind. We recommend it to all humanity who are
suffering from kidney and bladder diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for
the blessing you have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp-Root.
We remain, yours very truly, â¢ JAMES COOK,

To Whom It May Concern:
1 had been a sufferer for over four years from severe
attacks of rheumatism and kidney trouble, probably con-
tracted by exposure on hunting expeditions and wading
trout streams. I tried many remedies, the patent and other
kind, but none of them seemed to do me any good. I was
persuaded by an old and valued friend to try Swamp-
Rrot, and frankly confess that it has benefited me as no
other medicine has. I now feel like myself again. I do
not have the constant aches and pains which at one time
seemed to make life unbearable. It is a positive benefit in
ailments of this kind. I always keep it in the Louse, as it
Is Just as necessary as bread and butter. Very respectfully.

EDITORIAL NOTE â The ?reat kidney remedy, Swamp-Root, is so remarkably successful that a special arrangement has been made by which all
our readers who have not already tried it may have a sample bottle senf absolutely free by mail. Also a book telling all about kidney and bladder troubles and
containing many of the thousands upon thousands of testimonial letters received from men and women cured by Swamp-Root. Be sure and mention reading
this generous offer in San Francisco Daily- Call when sending your address to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamjton, N. Y. *
It used. to be considered that only ur-
inary and "bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning in the disorder of
these most' important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the
bloodâ that is their work.
â¢ . So when your kidneys are weak or
out of order, you can understand ; how
quickly your entire body is affected,
and how every organ seems to fail to
do its duty.
, If you are sick or "feel badly," begin
taking' the famous new discovery, Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help
air the other organs to health. A trial
will convince any one. . Â¦ .
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re-
sponsible for more sickness and suffer-
ing than any other disease, and if, per-
mitted to continue fatal results. are sure
to follow. Kidney trouble irritates the
nerves, makes you dizzy, restless,
sleepless and irritable. Makes. you pass
water often during the day and obliges
you to get up many times during the
night. Causes puffy or dark circles un-
der the eyes, rheumatism, gravel, caÂ»
tarrh'bf the bladder, pain or. dull ache
in the back, joints and muscles, makes
your head ache and back ache, causes
Indigestion, stomach and liver trouble;
you get a sallow, yellow complexion;
makes you feel as though you had heart
trouble; you may have plenty of ambi-
tion, but no strength; get weak and
waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kil-
mer's v Swamp-Root, the world famous
kidney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root
you afford natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect healer
and gentle aid to the kidneys that is
known- to medical science. 'Â¦
If there is any doubt in your mind as
to your qondltion, take from your urine
on rising about four ounces, place it in
a glass or bottle and let it stand
twenty-four hours. If, on examination,
it is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick
dust settling, or if small particles float
about in it," your kidneys are in need of
lmmediate'attennon.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and
Is used in the leading hospitals, recom-
mended by skillful, physicians in their
private practice, and is taken by doc-
tors themselves who have kidney, ail-
ments, because they recognize in it the
greatest and most successful remedy
for kidney, liver and bladder troubles.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular 50-cent and $1 size
bottles at the drug stores everywhere.

I was all run down in health and. spirits, from overwork on
the Exchange floor. I developed nervous neuralgia and also suf-
fered from an acute attack of rheumatism.
Of course, I had careful medical attendance, but while con-
valescing my own physician himself ordered me to take Swamp-
Root to build up my nervous system, and put my kidneys in shape.
It helped me more than any curative or tonic I ever used, and
now I always keep it in my medicine chest. With best wishes for
sufferers.

survive of the days when that banner floated
above Washington and his bloody-footed pa
triots at Valley Fprge; I trust something still
will live of the spirit that animated the men
who upheld that banner when they stood with
stubborn old Andrew Jackson at New Orleans.
I trust something of the life of liberty still
permeates the followers of yonder flag as when
they marched with Grant on his stubborn ad
vance to Richmond.
And. Mr. Chairman, If the day ever comes
when that banner Is nothing but a commercial
aseet, then, sir.' every stripe of white upon Its
folds Fhould be dyed In the blood of the men
we killed and conquered, and from yonder

Popular Election of Senators.
Rucker of Missouri submitted an argu
ment In favor of a constitutional amend
ment for the election of Senators by the
people. He said that thirty-two States
were on record as favoring the popular
election of Senators. Â¦Â¦ ; - . ;
Boutelle of Â»: Illinois closed the debate
with a brief .reply to the argument of
Cowherd. . He said that military glory
and commercial greed were as repugnant
to him as to the gentleman from Missouri.

Senator Warren agreed with Hoar upon
this latter point. He had, he said, been
favorable to. absolute free trade between
Porto Rico and the United States proper,
but he had listened with interest and
profit to the arguments on the other side,
and he did not believe that the subject
had been exhausted by any means. He
felt that everything was to be gained and
nothing to be lost by proceeding deliber
ately, especially in view of the fact that
the entire problem was new. Many other
speeches were made In the same line, not
ably by Senators Aldrlch and Mason.
At this point the suggestion of a com
mittee was made and as soon as the au
thority for Its apointment was given the
caucus adjourned sine die.
TELLER AND TURNER
TAKE OPPOSITE VIEWS
WASHINGTON, March H.â Two argu
ments'were presented to the Senate to
day in which almost antipodical positions
were taken by two Senators. Teller of
Colorado, In a brief speech, maintained
that the constitution could not extend
over territory acquired by the United
States, while Turner 01 Washington elab
orately contended that the constitution
embraced the acquired territory the very
moment the United States took permanent
possession of it. Teller held that this Gov
ernment could make the outlying territory
Into States or could hold it as colonies, a?
it saw fit, while Turner maintained that
the United States could not hold, colonies
or dependencies. Aside from the consti
tutional questions, the two Senators were
in practical agreement. Both were op
posed to the . pending bill and both ob
jected to any. of the Insular territory .be
coming a part of the United States or any
of its inhabitants citizens of the United
States. v :
Teller declared he could find ampla au
thority for legislation relating to our in
sular possessionsâ authority not derived
from the constitution. Said he: ' Â¦:.-,
I don't believe that the constitution is in force
in our new possessions. - Congress, I Â¦ believe.
Is supreme, so far as the making of legislation
for acquired territory Is concerned.: Of- course.
In enacting such legislation Congress is bound
by certain fundamental principles that underlie
this free Government. , .. . . ..
After, a careful examination of , all Supreme
Court authority I have been able to find only
one case that will support the doctrine that
the constitution goes of Its own vigor into the
acquired territory. \ -
.My own . belief is that . we can Â¦ make the
acquired territories a part of the United States
or not. as Conuress may Bee fit. If ,we don't
make them a part of the. United States I be
lieve,we. may hold them as colonies â that .we
have ' the same power to hold them as Great
Britain has to hold colonial possessions. ' t :
â¢ We don't want to make Porto Rico and the
Philippines a iart of the United States, and I
don't want -to make their Inhabitant* citizens
of the United States. Â¦ r. .
Teller said he desired all possible and
reasonable â¢ advantages â¢ and privileges to
be extended to these people, but he vould
not have them participate In the election
of a President of the United States, nor
would he give them representation in Con
gress. Â¦';â¢ ' 'â¢ : . Â¦-Â¦;â¢Â¦Â¦ -.- . Â¦ Â¦Â¦-'Â¦-Â«.'
Turner of .Washington then resumed l;Is
discussion of the Porto Rlcan â¢ question.
Taking up the line of this argument where
he dropped it yesterday, he Â¦* contended
that the â¢ pending bill was manifestly un
constitutional."'lt was undemocratic, > un
republican and . an unauthorized exercise
of power over the Inhabitants, of h Porto
Rico; -and he thus warned the powers In
the majority: ""Beware unless you betray
the hopes of ; the future In the I exigencies
of the present." Â¦' ';: : : : Â¦ . -

DELAY ACTION
ON THE PORTO
RICAN TARIFF
Republican Senators Succeed
in Effecting a Partial
Agreement
Relief Measure and Civil Government
to Be Disposed Of at Once and
the Question of Revenue
Postponed.
.. Â»
WASHINGTON, March 14.â The Repub
lican Senators in caucus to-day- reached
a partial agreement on Porto Rlcan legis
lation. The House bill appropriating $2,
000,000 is to bo taken up and passed imme
diately. The bill for a civil government
of the Island is to be taken up and dis
posed of as soon as possible, and the tariff
bill is to be delayed for the present, while
a committee of seven Senators may be se
lected by Chairman Allison to try to com
promise differences on the revenue bill
and secure a measure which Republican
Senators generally can support. This par
tial agreement was reached ' after a cau
cus lasting from 2 o'clock until after "5:30.
/The temper of the debate to-day was
much milder than that of yesterday. 1 As
soon as it was generally understood that
the tariff features of the legislation were
to be postponed "the discussion reverted to
the governmental features of the bill and
upon this subject the time was mostly
epent. . Â¦â ' .
Senator ' Foraker explained many
features of the bill and was frequently
interrogated/so that he was on his feet
a great deal of the time: He was ques
tioned by different Senators, , most of
whom wanted to know the effect of dif
ferent provisions of the bill. It was Inti
mated that the bill could be amended if
not satisfactory and Senators opposed to
a tariff on Porto Rican products said that
there would not be the least objection to
passing the bill.
Senator Elkins said that he- favored
leaving not only the question of revenues,
but the government of the island as well,
to the President. He thought the Inland
would be' much better off under, military
rule for the next two 'years than under
any government that could be devised
by Congress. He particularly counseled
delay .â¢â¢ â¢ > ' â¢
. Relief Urgently Needed. ,
There was general unanimity aa to the
wisdom of providing for Immediate action
on the $2,000,000 relief proposition.
Senator Platt of Connecticut, who was
not heard yesterday, expressed himself as
firmly Â¦ convinced â¢- that the principle of a
protective tariff in the interest of the in
dustries of the United States should be
sustained in whatever was done. :.
Senator Hoar "talked at . considerable
length about the legal phase of. the ques
tion; expressing the opinion that the Sen
ate could not act with too great delibera
tion In consideration of. so momentous a
subject. r

FINANCIAL BILL SIGNED
BY PRESIDENT MeKINLEY
Secretary Gage Galls in Outstanding
Bonds for Which New Issues Are
1 to Be Exchanged.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â At 12:46
o'clock this afternoon the President af
fixed his signature to the financial bill,
thus making it a law of) the land. Over
street of Indiana, who had charge of the
bill, arrived at the White House about
five minutes before that time and * was
shown into the Cabinet room,' where he
was Joined by the President, who, after
inquiring if the bill had been compared
with care, affixed his signature to it. At
the same time he recalled to those who
stood by the fact that many of the Im
portant financial bills which had been
passed by Congress had been approved on
the 14th of the month. He spoke of the
Sherman act,: the resumption act, and
now the bll} which was before him. In
signing the bill the President used a new
gold pen and holder, which Overstreet
had brought with him for the purpose.
Secretary Gage's Circular.
Immediately upon receiving notice that
the financial bill had been approved by the
President, Secretary Gage issued, a c'r
cu.ar to hcliters of United State* 5 por
cent. bonds cf the act of January 14, 1575;
4 ]â¢<-. cent consols of 1907, act of July 14,
157 iÂ». end Janvarv 20, IS7I, and S per cÂ»nt
bonds of 1908, of the act of June 13, 189S,
In which their attention 13 directed to sec
tion 11 of the act approved to-day. The
Secretary continues as follows: â¢- i â¢
Under the provisions of this law. the depart
ment will be prepared to receive on and after
this date, until further notice, any of the bonds
It-sued under the acts above mentioned, and as
early as practicable thereafter will issue In
exchange therefore | a like amount of United
States registered or coupon bonds bearing ln
terst at the rate of 2 per centum per annum,
as provided by the act approved March 14, 1900.
To effect the exchange the outstanding bond 3
should be surrendered to the Secretary of the
Treasury in accordance with the terms of this
circular; they will be accepted for that purpose
In the -order of the surrender of them to him.
and new bonds bearing interest at the rate of
2 per centum per. annum will be Issued in the
same order in lieu thereof. A letter of trans
mlttal should accompany each package of bonds
for exchange, setting forth the purpose for
which they are forwarded and giving the ad
dress to which the new bonds and checks for
the interest thereon shall be sent.
Bonds held by the Treasurer of the United
States in trust for a national bank- may be sur
rendered by letter addressed to -the Secretary
of the /Treasury, accompanied with the Treas
urer's receipt representing the bonds, together
with nf resolution of the board of directors ot
the bank authorizing the Treasurer to assign
the bonds.
Registered bonds, Inscribed in the name of
an Institution, forwarded for exchange, must
be accompanied by a resolution of the board of
directors of the institution, authorizing their
assignment to the Secretary of the Treasury for
such, exchange. The resolution must bear the
seal of . the Institution, or. If the institution
have no seal, there must be furnished with the
resolution an affidavit setting forth that fact.
Calculation of Interest.
Upon acceptance of any bonds for exchange
under the conditions of this circular, the pres
ent worth of the surrendered bonds to yield an
income of 2*i per centum per annum will be
calculated as of the date of their acceptance,
except as provided in the next paragraph, and
the sum representing the difference between the
political worth ;of said bonds and their par
value will be paid to the owner thereof In due
course by a check drawn in his favor by the
Treasurer of the United States. The settlement
will include payment by the department of ac
crued Â¦ Interest on the old bonds to the
date of their acceptance for exchange, and
a charge against the owner for accrued
interest on the new bonds from the date
of their issuÂ« to said date of acceptance.
Bonds surrendered upon which Interest has been
prepaid need not be accompanied by a deposit
to cover such prepaid interest, as the depart
ment will deduct at the lime of the settlement
any amount which may be due on account of
unmatured interest which has been prepaid.
The new bonds will be dated April 1. 1900:
therefore all outstanding bonds surrendered for
exchange and accepted for that purpose prior
to that date will bear interest to April 1.
and interest on the new bonds will begin, and
the present worth of â¢ such, surrendered bonds
will be calculated as of the said April L The
new bonds will be Issued In denominations as
follows: Coupon. J5O. $100, 1300. $1000. Regis
tered, $50. $100.': $500. $1000, $5000. $10,000. $30,000.

SEATTLE. March 14.â The steamer
Excelsior arrived here this after
noon with Captain Snow and the
passengers and crew of the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company's steamer
Wolcott. which was wrecked on the night
of January 31, near Karluk, Alaska. All

the foot of a glacier, in the snow and rain
without shelter on account of the unusu
ally high tides, but on the fourth day
managed to get away in the ship s small
boats to Uak Bay. where there is a sal
mon cannery. They reached the cannery
on February 4 and remained there till
February 27. when the Excelsior came
along and picked them up.
The Wolcott Is a total loss. She struck
at 10 50 at night on a rocky point half way
between Karluk and Uak Bay in a howj
ing northwest gale. Pilot Keen was on
the bridge at the time. Captain Snw
rushed on deck and backed her off, but she
began to tlli rapidly. The engineer report
ed he could keep her afloat only twenty
minutes and the captain then decided to
beach her. The passengers were put safe
ly ashore in small boats through heavy
surf. Food and blankets were got out of
th Amorfg the passengers on the Wolcott
were George C. Mayon and wife of Lnga.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, March
14.â A cablegram just received announces
the marriage of Mrs. Frances Hodgson
Burnett to Stephen Townsend. F. R. C. S.
of the Inner Temple, Continental Club,
London.
Mrs. Burnett came over to this' country
in October last, and after having spent
the winter at her Washington residence
sailed for Genoa on February 2S. On her
arrival at Genoa she was met by Mr.
Townsend and the* marriage was quietly
celebrated.
Mr. Townsend Is the son of the late Rev.
George Tyler Townsend, late incumbent
of St. Michaels, once chaplain to the
Duke of Northumberland, also Bishop of
Tasmania. By profession he Is a physi
cian, having won the degree of fellow
of the Royal College of Surgeons, but
while attaining great skill and efficiency
In his calling he has never cared for it
and several years ago gave it up for the
stage.
The romance began 'prior to the time
when Mrs. Burnett and Mr. Townsend
collaborated in the dramatization of "The
Lady of Quality." on the American rights
of which each of the playwrights realized
a fortune. Mrs. Burnett first met Mr.
Townsend through the introductions of
friends, and shortly thereafter engaged
him as her secretary. A few weeks later
she was thrown from her carriage and
nearly killed. A great London physician
who went to the country post haste finally
left her in charge of Mr. Townsend, whose
skill he knew and recognized in this im
portant crisis. Mrs. Burnett was still far
from recovery when she received Intelli
gence of the serious illness of her son,
Lionel, and left on the first steamer for
this country to take him back with her
for treatment by specialists on consump
tion. Mr. Townsend remained by the
boy's bedside with the mother nursing
him day and night untfl the end. Later
followed the collaboration In the drama
tization of "The Lady of Quality." Vivian
Burnett, the only surviving son. has been
for a number of years past on the staff
of one of the Denver (Colo.) papers.
For the next two months Mr. and Mrs.
Townsend will travel on the Riviera and
in the Island of Corsica before golncr to
the latter's English home, Maytham Hall,
one of the oldest and finest properties In
Kent.
It was at Maytham Hall that the greater
portion of .Mrs. Burnett's latest -book.
"Concerning the De WHlou^bby Claim,"
wis written. Her next important work
of dramatization will be en this book.

Initial Examination Is
Successfully Held
in the Girls' High
School Building.
Nearly Five Hundred
Appear to Compete
for Positions Under
the New Charter.
THE first civil service examination
preparatory to the inauguration of
the merit system in the municipal
government was held last night in
the Girls' High School. A number
of prominent citizens and office-holders
were present to testify the interest they
take In the new order of things.
Out of 567 applicants for the positions of
copyists, only 460 appeared for the exam
inations, half of whom were women. They
were accommodated at a dozen long tables
that stretched across the length of the
large auditorium. Seatod upon the stage
were Mayor Phelan, Civil Service Commis
sioners Freud, Quinn and McCarthy. ex-
Judge Slack, ex-Mayor Pond and F. W.
Dohrmann, constituting the Board of I.x
aminers. County Clerk Deane, Sheriff
Lackmann, Coroner Cole, Election Com

of Public Works, besides a number ot
employes in the City Hall. The gallery
was filled with a large number of specta-
When all the competitors had seated
themselves in their allotted places. Pres
ident Freud of the commission made a
short address, in which he announced the
appointment of the following teachers a-s
assistant examiners, who had volunteered
their services, at the same time paying
them a high compliment for so doing;
E. Brooke, Mrs. J. K. Burke, Mrs. H. J.

Chief Examiner Edward F. Moran had
for his assistants In supervising the direct
work of the. examination President C. W.
Mark and Mrs. Klncaid of the Board of
Education.
After Mr. Freud had read some of the
rules governing the examination a strong
box which contained the questions was
opened by Secretary Moran, and the first
subject, that of writing from dictation,
was commenced. A passage from the new
charter relating to public utilities was
read by Mr. Freud, who found it neces
eary to leave the stage and take a posi
tion in the center of the hall in order to
be heard distinctly. Even "then some of
the competitors found it difficult to under
stand what was being read.
The second subject was copying from
plain copy and was intended as a test of
the applicant's handwriting. The matter
was taken from the first part of a deed,
and it is significant that the women in
most cases finished first in the wÂ«uk of
transcribing. The third subject consistea
In copying from a rough draft section 12
of the charter. In which the words were
nearly all misspelled, abounding in Inter
lineations and utterly devoid of punctu
ation. After the competitors had put the
copy in proper shape the papers wero
handed In to the chief examiner, after ex
actly one hour had been consumed in the
proceedings.

by a Lawyer in the "Employ
of Governor Steunen
berg. " ; .
WASHINGTON*. March Itâ Feeling ran
high at the Coeur d'Alene Investigation
before the House Committee on Military
Affairs to-day and there were several spir
ited exchanges between Chairman Hull
and Representative Lentz.
George Cornell was on the stand, relat
ing his experience during Imprisonment,
which differed only In detail from that of
other witnesses. One of his recitals re
lates to an old soldier, who, because
of the brutality of the negro guards to
ward him. took his Grand Army button
from his coat and with tears in his eyes
threw it away. Cornell said he made a
memoranda of the affair, but the book
was taken from him, and he saw It after
ward in the possession of Bartlett Stn-
clair, the Governor's representative dur
ing the troubles.
Sinclair, who was present, arose and
declared that there was no such soldier
as had been described. *
Lentz protested against statements not
under oath. He gave notice that he would
call on Sinclair to produce all his books
to locate this alleged soldier entry.
Chairman Hull here interposed to re
mind Lenxz that he was not the entlra
committee and was not in a position indi
vidually to order the production of books.
This was the province of the committee,
and without such action Lentz's not lew
amounted to nothing:.
Lentz said that this was the usual no
tice that books referred to in testimony
would be called for. He asked that the
committee make the request, and without
objection this was done. Lentz movea
that the committee call for all rolls, rec
ords, etc., showing the names of those
held in the "bull pen." the charges against
them. etc. The committee went Into ex
ecutive session to pass upon the motion.
At the executive session the committee
voted by 6 to S against calling for the Im
mediate presentation of the rolls, records,
etc., of the "bull pen." It was agreed,
however, that General Merriam and oth
ers be requested to present any such pa
pers when they are heard.
"Was Steunenbsrg's Lawyer.
When the open session was resumed tha
testimony wa3 soon interrupted by an
other exciting controversy. One of the
attorneys present in behalf of the State
of Idaho occupied a seat near the head
of the table, and Lentz referred to the
"outside coaching" which was going on.
He also questioned the attorney as to
whom he represented, by whom he was
retained and what retainer had been paid.
The answer was that Governor Steunen
berg had given him a 1250 check as re
tainer. Then the following colloquy oc
curred:
Chairman Hullâ What difference does that
make? *
Sulzer of New Yorkâ Don't be so timid. Mr.
Chairman.
Stevens of Minnesotaâ There is such a thins
as decency.
That may be.
Stevensâ You had better set a Uttle of It.
Dick of Ohio â I object to the Insulting re
mark of the gentleman from Xew York to tlia
chairman. .
Sulzer â Never mind what you want to do
about It. I will have my rights here. You can
rest assured of that. I know. Mr. Dick, you are
very sensitive.
Dickâ Not at all sensitive to anything- yon caa
say.
Sulzer â We will have our say here.
The manner of the exchange showed
that the members were very much In
earnest. The witness then went on with
his testimony. He told of the vilenesa of
the barn where the men were first con
fined and of the harsh treatment accorded
them.

NEW YORK. March 14.â The police car
ried out their threat to-night and arrested
ihe proprietors cf most of the fashionable
resta.ura.nts. including the proprietor of
the Imeprlal Hotel, on the charge of hav
ing music in their restaurants without
a. concert hall license. The police also
visited such places as the Hotel Majestic,
the Marie Antoinette, the St. Andrew
and the Empire and ordered that the
music be stopped.
Ir.ter.se indignation was manifested by
some of those who came under the severe
hand cf the police to-night and they were
enraged that they should be arrested in
the same class with offenders like the pro
prietors of the Tivoli, the Bohemia, the
Cairo Cafe and other places of eimilar
reputation.
The manager cf Sherry's was compelled
to send his musicians home, owing to th*Â»
fact tnat he Â«2id not have a concert hall
license. The Waldorf-Astoria has a con
cert hall license, and the merry strain of
music was heard in that vicinity through
out the evening. The managers of the
Buckingham, the Savoy and the Nether
land, ail on Fifth avenue, received notice
to stop their orchestra until they ob
tained concert hail licenses, and they
complied with this order.
This action was taken by the police
after a consultation by Inspector Thomp
son and several cf the captains of the
Tenderloin station. Detectives were sent
cut about 7 o'clock, during the busy
hour cf the restaurants, and they
brought back a numberÂ»of prisoners. The
prisoners gave bail promptly and were
as outspoken in their denunciation of the
action of the peolice as were the patrons
at the restaurants.
Captain Donohue of the West Forty

men to stop all music, but they made no
arrests. The restaurants in the precinct
fcad to get along without orchestras. The ;
earne treatment was served out to all the
prominent restaurant proprietors in the
uptown districts.
A summons was served on Michael
Fhanlty to appear before a magistrate
and explain why he permitted music ia
his restaurant on Tuesday night.
WILCOX TELLS
STORY OF HIS
BRUTAL CRIME
Taken to Santa Rosa and
Given a Preliminary
[:,-.Â¦] Hearing.
Says -He Took Poison After Killing
His Wife, but It Did Not
Even Make Him
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March 14.â George F.
"Wllcox, the Kelseyville farmer whose
brutal murder of his wife at Lytton.
Springs last Wednesday caused such a
sensation, was brought back from Pasa
dena by Sheriff Frank P. Grace to-day
and lodged in the County Jail. He was
arrested at Pasadena Sunday afternoon,
having gone there to visit relatives.
Shortly after his arrival here he was
taken "before Judge Brown for examina
tion. He admitted his guilt and the ex
amination was waived. Wilcox sticks to
the story he told -when arrested at Pasa
dena and says he was insane at the time
he committed the deed. When examined
in jail just after his arrival he denied his
crime, but afterward made a complete
confession. , ?,
Me =ays he left his home at Kelseyville
and drove down to Lytton Springs, where
his wife was living with her brother. W il
11am Price, and family, with the Intention
if possible of inducing her to return and
live with him. If he falted in this he had
fully made up his mind to kill her. Ar
riving at Price's home, he at once began
a discussion of the subject. Before he
entered the house in which the crime was
committed, he says, he and his wife were
quarreling. As they entered Mrs. Wilcox
started to build a lire in the kitchen stove.
She was kneeling over the stove apply
ing the match when the first shot was
fired. It struck her in the neck, inflicting
a flesh wound. She screamed and, looking
up, cried, "Oh, George, don't." Without
heeding the agonized plea for mercy, the
murderer, according to his own story, at
once tired again, the ball this time enter
ing his wife's eye. She then fell to the
floor, and he fired a third time, placing
the smoking revolver close to the pros
trate woman's cheek before pulling the
The prisoner declares that when he left
home ft was his intention to kill himself
as soon as he had killed his wife, if that
became necessary, and for that purpose
he brought with him a small quantity of
poison. He afterward changed his mind.
Although his wife's body when found gave
evidence of her having been clubbed as
well as shot. Wilcox denies that he struck
her At first he denied that he had cov
ered her up with a blanket, but this be
afterward admitted. When he left the
house the woman was not quite dead, but
he says he knew she would not live long.
In explanation of his crime the prisoner
says he was attacked by a sudden fit of
Insanity, and after firing the first shot lost
himself completely and hardly knew
what happened until he found himself
walking rapidly away from the scene of
the crime. He says he took the poison as
intended, but it did not even make him
sick. In many important details the pris
oner's story falls to hang together, and it
Is hardly likely that his plea of temporary
insanity will be able to withstand the at
tacks to which it will doubtless be sub
jected by the prosecution.

ALBERT VALE
IN FRONT FOR
THE BUSH CUP
Tony Licalzi's Entry Dumps
the Talent in the New
Orleans Classic.
NEW ORLEANS, March 14.â The Bush
Cup, which, though "an afterthought this
year, will take its place among the South
ern turf classics, furnished an unsatisfac
tory contest to-day. Llcalzl's pair, Donna
Rita and Nailer, were favorites, coupled
In the straight betting at 9 to 10, and fin
ished second and third. : Kyrat, , which had.,
strong support at fours, made the runnim?

lenged ,by Albert Vale," which, came on
and won' as he^pleased.
Trladltza and lola, were the only, winning
favorites. Seldenbach's race In thte steeple-,
chase was unsatisfactory to the stewards,'
who j suspended ; the*', owner, - trainer and
jockey Stewart indefinitely, pending an in
vestigation.- They als"o recommend the re
fusal of further entry of the -mare Neva

onds in a moment. A crowd gathered in
Butler's corner and a riot seemed immi
nent. Butler tried to strike Stelzner again,
but the men were dragged apart and the
ring was cleared.
Before the two .heavyweights entered
the ring the rumor spread through the
building that all was not right in the bft
ting and that Referee Welch would de
clare all bets off. When wagering first
commenced Butler was a strong favorite,
at odds of 10 to 7. He continued at this
price until late yesterday afternoon, when
money poured into the poolboxes on Stelz
ner, until he was installed favorite, at
odds of 10 to 5. In the mutuels the bulk
of. the play was on Stelzner to win in the
first round.
When the men were In the ring "Billy"
Jordan made his announcement of the
directors of the National Athletic
Club having "met and held a meeting," in
which they decided to declare all bets off.
"Jack" Welch, the referee, stepped to the
center of the ring as the men were about
to go Into action and said: "I declare all
bets on this fight off." The clang of the
gong then started proceedings. ? Â¦Â¦
The boxers were allowed no representa
tion in the box office. After they had gone
to their dressing-rooms they were noti
fied that as the fight was palpably a
fake they would receive nothing for their
labors. The articles of agreement call for
them to receive CO per cent of the gross
receipts, to be divided between them, the
lion's share going to the victor. Out of
their share the management wanted to
take $500 to pay the boxers in the prelim
inary, but finally compromised by taking
J225." Of this Stelzner contributed $150 and
Butler $75.
Although the genuineness of the first
bout was not questioned It was evident
Herrera could win when he pleased.
When it reached the round In which his
friends had bet on him to win he sailed
in and the agony was soon ended..
The bout between Aurelio Herrera and
Crockey Boyle ended In the tenth round,
Boyle being knocked out. A right on the
jaw sent Boyle to the floor, the ropes at
the ringside breaking his fall. He was
still dazed when he stood up, and a crush
ing right on the jaw sent him through the
ropes, and but for the assistance of spec
tators he would have fallen to the floor.
He was out for more than the allotted ten
seconds. Boyle was a disappointment lo
ring followers. His showing In the Kast
against such shining lights as "Kid"'
Broad, Boland and other prominent pugil
ists gained him immediate recognition by
the National Club. He showed him?e!f
last night a parlor boxer without an ef
fective blow. His guarding was faultless,
but he could not withstand the fierce at
tacks of Herrera. The latter amuscl the
spectators with his pecullarfoot work. He
moved about as though stepping on egg
shells. At times he brought his right foot
forward with a motion like pulling it out
of soft and adhesive tar. He depends al
most entirely on right-hand swings In his
attacks. He is a stiff puncher and when
he lands his opponent feels the Impact. A
man with a good left will, -apparently, be
able to take his measure.
Poolsellers Suspected a Fake.
The report was circulated late last night
that Groom and Gibbs of the National
Club had wagered the entire receipts of
the box-omce on Stelzner. and that their
action In ordering the referee to declare
all bets off was forced upon 'them by two
well-known pool-sellers, who learned of
the BCheme to rob the public, and threat
ened to expose the whole nefarious busi
ness unless this was done.
CURTIS KENNEL
WINS THE STAKE
WITH McKINLEY
Black and White Greyhound
Defeats St. Michael
Handily. "
Weather Conditions Affect the Hares,
Making Them Bun in an Erratic
Manner in Many
Courses.
After being started twice a week for
over a year past Curtis & Son's black and
white greyhound McKlnley surprised both
his owner and the betting public by win
ning the midweek stake. He met St.
Michael in the final and beat him point
less, winning by a score of 5 to 0. - In the
semi-final round he met Forget, and won
by a score of 3 to 2. Forget was a hot
favorite in the betting, the odds being 5
to 2. McKlnley had' a severe course in the
fourth round with Just Tip, which it was
thought had ruined his chances. He came
back strong, however, and won out.
The sport throughout the day was of
poor class, owing to the hares. These
were new to the place and were, appar
ently benumbed by the cold of the pre
â¢ vious night. There were an unusual num
ber of undecided courses. Bona Fide was
unfortunate to go unsighted in two
courses. Reannex and Kandom Aim ran
three times before the latter raised the
flag. In one course the brace ran head
and head to the hare. The latter dropped
in front of them, and as no work had
been done it was called "no course."
Sally Brass beat Stromboli, which was
favorite at 5 to 7; Nellie G beat Slim at
the same odds; Bona Fide won from Min
nie Wa Wa at 2 to 5; Jesse Moore beat Sir
Pasha at 1 to 6. The detailed results of

DECISION THAT
OUGHT TO HELP
RACING VASTLY
Prince Poniatowski's Filly
Ella Boland Unjustly :
Disqualified.
Race Given to corrigÂ£n's St. Casimir,
Arousing a Storm of Indignant
Protests at Tanforan
Could Prince Poniatowski have been a
epectator at Tanforan Park yesterday the
blue blood coursing through . his veins
would have tingled with delight, as ho
taw his fast filly Ella Bo-and defeat Ed
Cerrlsaa'a sprinter St. Ca.simir. The next
moment this sciun of noijliny would have
been plunged in grief, for the winner was
disqualified for an invisible foulâ an ever
lasting disgrace to the California turf. It
was a ruling that met with a perfect ava
lanche of hoots and jeer* when announced
in the ring and left a stain on the San
Mateo track that can never be effaced.
The fourth race on the programme, a
five furlong scramble for all ages, caused
all the excitement. Corngan's St. Casl
mlr, carrying Henry and ninety-seven
pounds, opened a 1 to 2 chance. Some
heavy commissions v?ent In on him until
1 to 3 was the post quotation. Ella Bo
land had Johnny LÂ»aly wj vni 3 to 1 was
obtainable about her. Six other lesser
lights also vest into Caldwell's hands.
The etart was' a poor one, the barrier
been carried awav.andsomeindiscriminata
bumping resulted. Ella Boland, first
away, made all the running, but when op
posite the paddock, with St. Casimir at
her side, looked beaten. Henry, on the
favorite, then appeared to grow careless,
pet-ing which Daly drew his whip. The
filly he was on gamely responded, nipping
Corrlgan's sprinter out a nose In liOO'i. a
fast performance. One after another the
jockeys were called into the stand, Daly
the last_ Then, quicker than it takes time
to tell, the numbers were changed, St.
Cas'.mir being placed first and Ella Bo
land last. No wonder racing in this State,
is on the ragged edge!
Three favorites captured purses. The
attendance was not large, and from mur
muring? heard among the crowd It bids
fair to be smaller this afternoon.
On her fine showing 5n a mile run at
Oakland pome days ago with Flamora and
Flower of Gold La Borgia looked far and
away the best of the sixteen maidens In
the opening run. The ring laid 5 to 1
about her, and she won drawing away
from Red Cherry at the wire. Uterp, a
12 to 1 shot, "showed." .
The Brioso filly Intrada, from J. Xagleo
Burk's stable, opened favorite for the
two-year-old four and a half furlong
scramble. Later the betting Indicated
Rollick to be the good thing, his price
failing from 3 to i* to 5. Moon bright, a
12 to 1 chance, nearly upset things. She
1*^ almost to the wire, where Thorpe
brought Rollick up, winning by a length.
Geyser, a 1 to 2 chance, walked in ahead
of Advance Guard for the mile and a six
teenth run. Potente ran a close third.-
Old Ostler Joe warn f< j nt to the post fa
vorite for the seven furlong affair, finish
ing third on three legs. Los Medanos, at
3 to 1, made easy work of Mamie G.
Marty Bergen, with the leg up on The
Lady, backed down to 4 to 6 favoritism
for the final number, met with a world
of hard luck. In a hard drive Henry beat
him out a nose with 'Wallenstein. The
winner receded in the betting from 2 to 5
to 1.
Track Notes.
Frank Eckert. who lost a small fortune
by the declaring off of the bets on the
Torlbio race, pot in well again yesterday.
He took several big- wagers on St. Casimir
and backed Ella Jioland around the ring.
The ruling cost him just about J5000.
A turfman who styles himself "A
Player." In a query pent to this paper, asks
why Judge Burke declared bets off on the
race Toribio was beaten in and not on
the May \V race. If fraud was practiced
on both occasions, the writer continues,
why was not similar action taken In
Â«-arh case? (Pass the buck.â Racing Ed

that will cleanse the city of an immoral
and dangerous nuisance..-
The affair last night presents all that is
best in the trade which Supervisor Tobln
seeks to suppress. The National Club is
the firm name of J. J. Groom and J. D.
Gibbs, "promoters," gamblers, sports or
anything else that suggests an increase
to their store of ready money. These gen
tlemen are not unique; they are typical of
a very large and interesting class which
now infests the city. Their star attraclioi:
last night was a contest between Jack
Stelzner, a white "gentleman" and Joe
Butler, a black "gentleman." On Tuesday
i night Butler was a very pronounced fa
; vorite and a great deal of money was
wagered on him. The vitality and very
life of the game is in the poolrooms,
where the gullible public goes to oe
plucked. Butler was the public choice be
cause under fair conditions he should have
won. So the public plunged on him as
they always do under the inspiration ot
a delusion that the game is honest.
Yesterday the gamblers made those ar
rangements which are invariably neces
sary in all of these affair?. They took
pains to assure themselves that Butler,
notwithstanding his condition and superi
ority, would lose, not win. The public
money was already staked. Part of the
game bad been played, but the gamblers
j nac' to do something more. Butler must
not only lose but he must lose in the first
live rounds, so the gamblers could steal
the public money on the first line of the
parts mutuels. it is a great game when
you know how to play it, and it would be
a liberal education for the fool patrons
of the pcolrooms to . discover how the
gamblers learned that Butler would lose,
Then came the little detail of robbing
the public by taking its money to witness
a fake contest. The National Club is a
reasonably shrewd firm itself and among
schemers It sometimes pays for one set
to cheat the other. The club by written
agreement had promised to give the fight
ers 60 per cent of the gate receipts. That
is a great deal of money for a firm of
such shrewdness as the National Club to
allow to slip through its fingers, so the
club went Into executive session with it
self and determined to cheat-the fighters
by paying them no money, to give the
gamblers the double cross by declaring
no contest and to defraud the public by
charging for a fake contest.
And that Is what happened last night.
The referee was ordered to declare all
bets off. The fighters fought for two
rounds and Butler lost on a foul, thus los
ing on the first line In the parls mutuels.
The fighters were told that they were en
titled to no money, as there was no con
test, and the public went home thor
oughly convinced that It Is a great game,
but hard to play.
Stelzner was fortunate In having the
bout end in the second round, as he was
In for a bad beating at the hands of But
ler. The latter can hit as hard and as
fast as a steam-hammer, and proceeded
to do so from the start. He landed right
or left as he pleased on head" or body.
In the first round Stelzner did not lead
once, but took a lot of punishment. After
one sharp rally. In which Butler punched
as long as he had one hand free, Stelzner
went to the floor. â¢ â¢ .
In the second and last round Butler
rlpp**d In blow after blow on the body,
Jabbed with his left and uppereut with
his right. Butler landed two stiff lefts on
head and body and sent Stelzner to the
floor. He was down about eight seconds, i
and no sooner was he up. than he was,
floored again. He was on one knee, with
the colored man standing over him In an
aggressive attitude, waiting for him; to
arise. Stelzner seemed afraid to stand up
and -Referee WVlch had to push Butler to
one side, Stelzner being down over ten
seconds. This went unnoticed in the ex
citement, and Just at the belj signaling
the end of the round, while Stelzner was
Btlll down. Butler rushed at i him , and
struck him. All was confusion for a mo
ment, the adherents of Stelzner claiming
a fouJ. After a moment's hesitation the
referee allowed Â¦ the claim. . .

OLD SPANISH CANNON
FOR CITY HALL PARK
NEXT Wednesday General Shatter will present to the city one of the old .
bronze guns from the saluting battery at Punta Gorda, just outside
of Santiago. The presentation will take place in City Hall Park,
where after It has been presented the gun will rest.
The gun. from the inscription upon it, is probably of French manu
facture. It Is beautifully carved and bears the name of the Due de. Conde.
Whether it belonged to this nobleman or to his army or whether it was
just given his name is a mystery. : It was'acommon practice a' century or
two centuries ago to name. the large guns after celebrated men, and it is prob
able that the gun to be given the city was named after the celebrated
Frenchman. The gun is about as large as a muzzle-loading 5-inch or a 21
pounder. It appears to have been made at least one hundred and fifty years
ago. How it got into the hands of Spain and then to its place in the saluting
battery, at' Santiago is not known, but it is believed It came to be part of the
Spanish armament during the time Joseph Napoleon held the throne of Spain.
The gun is one of many that were captured in Cuba, but of them all
there was nons finer. The Government was very strict in dealing out the
guns, and it so apportioned them as to allow one for each State. In courtesy
to General Shafter, who captured them, however, he was allowed to have
two for tbis State, one of which. he has already, presented to the city of Los
Angeles end the other he will present to San Francisco.
The Native Sons" organization will take a prominent part in the ceremo
nies of presentation, and the affair will be made one to be remembered. The
gun willbe properly mounted Ir. the park as a curiosity, for its days of war
are over. It was a fine gun in Us time, however, and one that has seen serv
ice in many climes. It is of the finest metal and it shows the marks of the
finest workmanship, and if it could only tell all it has seen and heard it
might add a strange and valuable chapter to the world's history.
The cannon bears the following inscription:
"Captured at Santiago de Cuba July 17. IS9S, by the Fifth Army Corps, U.
S. Army, commanded by Major General William R. Shafter, and presented
by him to the city of San Francisco, Cal.. in trust for the Native Sons of the
Golden West and accepted as a token of the valor and patriotism of the array
of the United States." . .

At the meeting of the Board of Educa

presented a set of rules which will govern
him in the investigation and preferment
of charges against teachers in the depart

uniformity In teaching. He called atten

HEALTH BOARD
PERFORMS SOME
QUEER ANTICS
Citizens About Chinatown
Suffocated to Satisfy Pet
Hobbies.
But One Tonjj Blocks the Consul's
Movements Tending to Estab
lish Peace Ones
More.
Much indignation was expressed last
night by the residents of the territory
about Chinatown, on account of the Board
of Health's unprecedented action in burn
ing heaps of rubbish and debris on a
vacant lot fronting on Pacific street, be
tween Dupont and Stockton. During the
day yesterday dense clouds of smoke
spread over the vicinity tor blocks around,
and last night the citizens In the neigh
borhood, .having had enough "of that sort
of nonsense,. rose up in rebellion.
The excuse for tne establishment of a
sanitary reduction works in the heart of
the city given by Phelan's Health officials
is that the refuse had collected in China
town and that it had been proposed to al-'
low none of the stuff to be taken through
the' streets of the city, for fear that the
germs which brought crape on the door
of the board's menagerie might drop on
the cobblestones ana devastate some of
the barnyards about the city.
Accordingly, the scavengers, to whom
such action was a "snap," as they did not
have to enrich the coffers of the reduction
works people, carted load after load of
nlth and dumped it on the lot. The truck
they brought there would not burn in
two months, but .it smolders and emits
dense volumes of smoke, which. naturally
discommodes the entire neighborhood,
business people included. .-Besides the ac
cumulation of such a large quantity of
debris is thought to be a menace to
health. ...

new- modern wharves, to be known as
."Filbert and. Greenwich street wharves"
respectively, .and also to 'change the car

wharf to the north of said wharf.
, These improvements â¢ j will cost about

on contracts already under way and
awarded, amounting to over $140,000, will
aggregate an amount approximating $300,-

Fishermen's headquarters are to be

and Section ti of the seawall, a breaK

use of tne hshermen. The contract for

The Commissioners also awarded the
contract for widening 'JacKtion-streec

Co.' The biu was for $<3W, and tne worK
will begin at once. The contract for the
ferry slip to be built between piers 3' and
5 was awarded to the City street Im
provement company for $2St>2. .
The iiarbor commissioners will soon
have tne handling of Vis,W) which haa
heretoiore been tied up. At the extra ses
sion of the Legislature a bill was, passed
directing the transfer of this sum from
the San Francisco depot sinking fund
to San Francisco haruor improvement
fund. The Harbor Commissioners were
desirous of. having the change made in
order to know for a certainty the amount
of money they could . count upon in
making up their estimates ior tne con
templated Â¦ improvements along the city
front. State Controller E. P. Colgan and
State Treasurer Truman Reeves desired
to have some assurance that the act was
not in conflict with the constitution be
fore carrying 1 out its provisions and made
such an inquiry of the Attorney General.
Yesterday in response to this inquiry
Deputy Attorney General Sturtevant ren
dered an opinion to the effect that the act
passed uy the recent special session of the
Legislature directing, the transfer of $3t>,-
Ooj from the San Francisco depot sinking
fund to the San Francisco f harbor im
provement fund is constitutional, and
that the State Treasurer and State Con
troller should make the transfer.
Can Use the Money.
The so-called San Francisco depot act,
winch was passed in IS9I and provided tor
me issuance of State bonds to the amount
of $tjou,<M> lor the erection of the ferry tie
pot, also nrovlded for the establishment
of a sinking fund to meet the interest and
principal ot the bonds when they should
become due. The depot act furtner pro
vided that the bonds should bear date
January 1, 1593, but that no interest should
be paid for any time which might inter
vene between the date of the bonds ana
the date of the sale thereof. It is also
provided in the depot act that the State
Treasurer shall on the first day of each
and every month after the date of thÂ«,
bonds, take from the San Francisco har
bor improvement fund $4631 and place the
same in the San Francisco depot sinking
The bonds were as a matter of fact not
sold until eighteen months after their
date, and $3t>,000 had therefore accumu
lated in the depot sinking fund before any
of the bonds were purchased. The object
of the act passed by the special session
was to transier this amount back to J.he
harbor improvement fund, whence it
came where it might be put to some use,
instead of allowing it to lie idle in tht
depot sinking fund. _ . .
The Controller and Treasurer were of
the opinion that the act of 1891 became a
part of the contract between the pur
chasers of the bonds and the State, and
that the act of the special session making
the transfer impaired the obligation oi
that contract, and was therefore in con
llict with the Federal constitution. They
were, also oh the opinion that the act was
in conflict with section 1 of article XVI of
the State constitution.
State Can Be Sued.
Mr. Sturtevant holds that the act of
IS9I was enacted so greatly In detail as to
payment of interest and principal of the
bonds because at that time the State
could not be sued, but that since that time
a statute has been passed prescribing a
simple procedure for sulnK the. State- oi>
its contracts, and that therefore even had
the bondholders acquired under the provi
sions of the act. of Ib9l any interest in the
moneys accumulated in the sinking fund,
which is extremely doubtful, the Legisla
ture has merely substituted one remedy
for another, which the Supreme Court of
the United States has declared it has the
power to do. Mr. Sturtevant further
states that ' under well settled rules- of
statutory construction the act of Â¦ the.spe
cial session is not in conflict with section
1 of article XVI of the State constitution.
Attorney General Ford, in concurring In
the -conclusions reached by Mr. Sturte
vant, says:
"It'seems quite clear to me that In what
ever light you view the act of February
S 1900, its provisions must stand. , If we
view alone the face of the statutes of 1891
and 1900 we shall find no evidence of the
violation ,by the Legislature of any con
stitutional provision. In other words, we
shall find no fact with which to overthrow
the nresumption that % the Legislature
nr-ted within its constitutional authority.

A DUTY OF THE COURT.
O ITORNEY GENERAL FORD has asked the
/ A Supreme Court to advance the case of the
* People vs. Wells-Fargo Express Company on
the calendar so that it may be argued and decided nt
nn early day. It is not going too far to assert it to be
:hc duty of the court to grant the request. The case
i? one of urgency, for every day of delay means that
much of time given to the express company to shift
i:j>on the public the burden of taxation which Con
gress laid upon express companies in order that they
might pay their just share of the war taxes.
The people are not forgetful of the fact that when
the great corporations of the country desired a deci
sion from the Supreme Court upon the validity of the
income tax a way was found to brir.g the issue before
the court twice ere the first installment of the tax
could be collected. No difficulty was found at that
time in passing the test cases promptly from one court
to another until they reached the supreme tribunal.
Why can there not be an equal promptness in decid
ing the cases against the express company? Liks
the income tax question, it is an issue affecting na
tional revenue, and concerns the public at large.
Why. then, should not the courts act in this case as
Pile former one and, on the ground of public ex
ency, advance it on the calendar and give it a
ing and a decision in advance of cases which af
iect only one or two individuals.
That the express company should shirk its taxes is
a disgrace to the corporation, but that it is permitted
tv go on shirking taxes for years despite the repeated
arP'als of the people to the courts is a disgrace to the
;i<!mir.istration of justice. The lower courts have
time and again given judgment against the corpora
tion, but it pays no more heed to^them than it does
to the commandment given upon Sinai â "Thou shalt
not steal." The corporation claims it is waiting for
the Supreme Court to act. The people are waiting
for the same thing. Jt is said the briefs on appeal
.-â¢re all in and the matter is fairly at issue.' Under
such circumstances it is clearly the duty of the court
to ?rant the request of the Attorney General and ad
vance Â«h^ case to an immediate hearing and decision.

CALIFORNIA will have many exhibits of her materialities at Paris. All that lives and grows in wind
or water or on the land will be there in every state of preparation to- eat, drink, wear, look at, feel of
and listen to. It will all be officially watched and tended, and public authority will shepherd it and be
its guide, philosopher, and friend, through the trials of examination by the world's eye in that great show.
But these materialities will, after all, be subordinate to the exhibit of intellect^that is put on yiewjin the
official polyglot pamphlet, printed in ten colors and three languages by ; thY California -Commission. '',- We file
it in any competition of composition as proof that the" noble rhetoric "of understatement* is ,a, myth.';' Pity,
'tis that its pulsating periods have to be . refrigerated in such verbal cold "storage" as the English, French
and Germr.n languages. The torrid iridescence of Arabic or Persian would do it greater justice. / Confined
to the t'nree tonjrues in which it is luminously embalmed its 'opalescence .is/of the -same moonlight type
ias the sober effulgence of the glowworm, when, in more fervid garb, it Svould rival the glory-hole, of the
; furnace of a glass factory. , . .-' Â¦ ... / ' , â¢ Â¦'Â¦-.- "
Its introduction establishes the altitude of the whole magnificent streamer of language that follows.
Please bate your breath with anything handy and read: "California, the sun-kissed State of the Anieri
i can continent, needs no herald to sing her praises, for long ere this her fame has been sounded _by golden
trumpets throughout the civilized world. Realizing, though, that the "countless multitudes in â¢ attendance
upon the Paris' lnternational Exhibition will, attracted by her exhibits, seek* further information regarding
her resources, the California Commissioners to the Fair offer this Souvenir Album as evidence of the
glories and advantages of the treasure land of the Far West."
Then, to show how easy it is for a commission to outsing a herald and' outblow a trumpet, that official
body addresses itself to a task which it announces to be unnecessary.
Perhaps we should pause right here, impatient as we are to mine in. this Golconda of adjectives and
revel in this Ind and Ormus of superlatives, to .give that opening salvo as it appears in French: "La Cali
fornie, celui de tous les etats americaines que caresse le plus amoureusement.le soliel, n'a plusbesoin
qu on chante les louanges, car.il y a longtemps que renommee a etc repandue a son de trompe par totite
le monde civilise." : '"â¢â¢' Â¦ ."''.', Â¦-Â¦-"?', "-â¢ â¢â¢Â¦..
The satisfaction of putting on a language that per force has to admit the /supremacy of "California" -by
capitalizing it and demoting "American" to lower case, is dimmed by a mean advantage which the French
translator takes. of the commission in omitting the adjective "golden," descriptive of the trumpet which
has run the risk of bronchitis in spreading our fame. It is a mean French attempt to leave the matter open
to suspicion that it may have been a tin trumpet or a tawdry trombone. But, let that pass. The second
statement of our resources is romance, with a dash of the tragedy of obstetrics: "Born in romance, nur
tured amidst excitement and existing to-day as one of the most picturesque communities under, the sun,
California's career, brief as it is, forms one of the most interesting chapters of the .world's history." ' â¢
The jealous spirit of the French translator puts much of the light of that'under a bushel by rendering
it: "Avec ses legendaires origines." We hope the commission will consider. this when it pays the bill..
Continuing, the commission patriotically twists the tail of the British lion by calling Sir Francis Drake
an "English buccaneer." and as the French and German languages are just now anti-English, this goes in as
"boucanier" and "englischen freibeuter," respectively. This symptom of a new dreibund is worthy the at
tention of the sleuths of international politics. But we must pass on. What home-seeker can resist this
description of the resources of the State, in which the commission indulges immediately after classifying
Drake with Captain Kydd and Lafitte: "Mountains whose snowclad crests reach far into the sky, giant
trees rearing themselves aloft like mighty pillars supporting the heavens, huge forbidding rocks whose
stern rugged grandeur bespeaks-the infinite, the soft churning of a rippling stream as it courses over "its"
mountain bed, while in the distance echoes the hoarse roar of waterfalls dashing themselves to pieces upon
the rocks beneath â well indeed can awe-struck man gaze at such a scene and with the psalmist say, 'How
wondrous are the works of the Almighty!'" Well, you bet that is what awe-struck man will say, and of
the .'millions of things that have been "said with the psalmist," David, who knew a good thing at a long
distance, will admit that it takes the cake. That sentence inspired the French translator with a sense of the
fitness of things that fit, and he put it' down as "La terre dcs Dieux."
It is a pity to find a gnat in such a pot of the precious ointment of language, still we think it is weak
ened a little by merely sticking the snowclad crests fast in the sky. They should'have punched a hole dear
through it.
After several pages of this, in a style that makes hyperbole feel like the man with Â¦ a hoe, and makes
metaphor feel as naked as the Greek Slave, the commission catches its. breath and remarks: "At times' a
glimpse of Paradise and then a f savagery of surrounding that strikes terror to the heart â sublime in its im
pressiveness, soul-stirring in its majesty â such is California, the fairest, most beautiful and most gifted land
eternity has ever known." The commission then observes that: "A small native oyster flourishes in countless
millions along the coast," and that "the epicure need have no fears regarding a supply of game, for it reaches
the table in endless variety. All kinds of ducks, quail, doves, larks, geese, plover, pheasant, pigeon, snipe,
deer, antelope, mountain sheep and goats, lions, panthers, grizzly and cinnamon" bears, leopards, lynxes,
wolves, wildcats and other sport-furnishing quadruped," are present to quiet the fears of the gourmet. Yes
indeed, the tasty feeder can sit down to a wildcat stew any time. We regret that the too numerous ground
squirrel and our own jackrabbit are omitted from the inventory.
After disposing of the game dinner feature, the commission passes to the health that .waits on appetite,
and, folding its napkin again, takes its pen in hand to observe: "Despite all her wooded and mineral treas
ures, her prolific soil and her unequaled commercial position, the principal claim California makes upon
the attention of the world is that of her unsurpassed climate. Ponce de Leon, in~search of the elixir of
life, might, have almost asserted the right to have found it had he journeyed as far as California's hospit
able shores, for the State is virtually one huge sanitarium, especially for those afflicted with pulmonary
troubles." : ,'.' I
This is a proper rebuke to those narrow-minded people who do not desire the presence of the narrow
chested here in great numbers. The commission gets off the key a little in saying that: "The nights are
deliciously cool, and cloudless skies prevail at all times, except during the rainy season."
Even Jove will nod sometimes, but we think the spirit and symmetry of the production should have
seen preserved by insisting that rain falls from a clear sky. Again, the commission inadvertently puts us
in the vulgar company- of other States by admitting that "the rainfall fills the creeks and rivers." That is
what the rainfall does elsewhere, and it should not act that way in "La terre dcs Dieux." - 1
Space forbids that we display the art treasures of this album. It abounds in chocolate nougat ferry
boats plying the bay: in seal-brown ladies erect in beautiful isolation on mountain peaks; "in primeval for
ests of navy blue: in yellow farmhands carrying home the harvest of red hay, and olive derricks getting
pink petroleum out of the dark blue ground. But. these things must be seen to be appreciated. To call it
all fine is a cowardly evasion of one's plain duty to declare it simply resplendent. Hotels and real es-

When the Republican State Central

Primary elections of the old style may
not be held to choose delegates to tho
State and Congressional district conven
tions, which will assemble to elect dele
gates to the National Republican conven
tion at Philadelphia. It is quite well un
derstood throughout the country that
President McKlnley will be re-nominated
by acclamation and re-elected by the larg
est vote ever cast for a Presidential can
didate. In view of this fact, there is not
likely to be much strife irv the selection of
delegates to represent California In th-s
national convention., _ - â¢
Word comes from Santa Clara County
that the.Republicans-of that locality are
oppesed to' the' holding; of primaries &>r .
the first convention â¢of the. season. Tho
objection advanced Is on the ground of ex- â¢
pense. It is held that Republican clubs or
committees .can appoint acceptable dele
gates and that such appointment or selec
tion will save the cost of conducting pri
mary elections in the various Assembly
districts. â¢ Â¦Â¦';â¢
Next September conventions will be held
to nominate Presidential Electors, candi
dates for Congress, the State LegislatorÂ©
and the Judiciary. Delegates to these lato
conventions must be chosen according to
the provisions of the primary election law
of this State. The primary elections for
such delegates will be held in August.
As both the Republican and Democratic
national conventions will have assemble!
and adjourned before August, the primary
election law can have no bearing on tne
election of delegates to these national
councils.
INSURANCE SCHEMES OF RAILROADS.
The Call does "not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for wHatever. value they may
â¢ have as communications of general interest.
.Editor The Call:- Referring to'the com
munication of John P.- Irish In your issue
of March 9, under, the head of ."Insurance
Schemes 'Â¦Â¦_Â¦. pt'~^ Railroads,"- which was
brought to, my attention by an employe of
the Southern Pacific , Company,' who asked
my, opinion of the.scheme and Mr.. lrish's
argument in particular/ I have also : been
asked by, a great. number of others, to all
of whom, l Tiave, replied that It is insur
ance'ln two^days,- viz.; that, it insures
Collis PPs. s Huntington" .'a return of ; . part -of
the hard-earned salaries of the employes,
and will," if kept in force, : Insure'; him the
downfall of all their labor organizations.
Further than this., it is a farce. This is
my opinion- based on an experience of a
considerable length of . time : with the
greatest life insurance, company in the
world,. viz.', the New York Life. We are
each entitled to our individual opinions.
The fact that the basis of income is the
salary ,of the member and not his age
makes it a money making scheme. Life
Insurance Us based on the age of the In
surer, not his income.- Then again, all the
present I employes (prior to. March . 1) are
taken ," without . regard -to physical condi
tion, age or medical examination. If this
scheme is legitimate life insurance, is this
fair to those who are healthy and young?
Certainly not,, as a man 60 : years of age.
in the last stages of consumption, has the
same chance as the- healthy young man
of 25, if there be a chance. / -
Mr. Irish says if they are killed in the
service of the company the. indemnity is
$3000. Very well; but < suppose his salary
Is only $35 per month," what then is his in
demnity? Only $500, and If he lives I be-
lieve twenty-six, weeks after the accident
and then dies he gets $250 only. Â¦*:Â¦:,â¢ u?-i
Mr. Irish refers to tbe great Pennsyl
vania Railroad as an example of the bene
fits under this' scheme. ~lt may be well to
say in this connection that the employed
of the road mentioned are the lowest pam
railroad men in this country. They are
inexperienced," cheaply provided for. ana
no employe of this road Is ; a member or
any organization, r Why? * Because_thls
same scheme -has frozen them out.-, vv nac
is. the result? The employes are screwed
down to the last notch and really have no
privileges of any kind.
Why. if the idea is a good one, are the
new employes compelled to join tnis ae
partment? Simply this: To compel a re
turn of a part of their wages r.nd later on.
when every employe is a member, to ir.c.x .Â¦
new regulations whereby the memwu
will not be allowed membership in r.a>
labor; organization. The executive com
mittee, I believe, -has power to enact new
rules, etc.. and can if It desires legislate
the members off their feet!
Now as to cost. We will assume for the
sake of argument that the insured^ is 30
years of age and gets a salary of $..-> pei
month. The cost is $3 60 per month in this
relief department.- or $43 20 per year. J\ c
will have to, figure on the supposition that
he will die on duty in order to make any
comparison with the life insurance con
tract. What does he get? Viz., $100 p.
And if he takes the natural death benefit
he has to pay â¢ extra for it. If he quits
paying through discharge he loses his
chances for benefits and all he has paid

Teachers and Merchants Agree.
The litigation between the merchant
creditors of the School Department and
the teachers will be finally settled within
a day or two. and the money held by the
Union Trust Company will be proportion
ally distributed without further delay.
About thirty-two teachers and sixteen
janitors have not yet signed .a release,
but as their Interests amount to but a few
hundred dollars ' bonds will be furnished
the Union Trust Company to protect it in
consequence of . the neglect or Â¦ refusal of
teachers to. sign the release. The' teach
ers have received 61 per cent of their No
vember salaries and will receive about
$15,000, or 12 per cent, more In a few days
The. delay in the distribution of -these
funds has been caused by the indifference
of certain teachers, who . persisted in re
fusing to sign a release to the Union
Trust Company. These teachers are now

MINING INTERESTS IN THE SOUTH.
rROM a letter addressed by Congressman de
Vries to W. C. Ralston, president of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, it appears there are
certain elements at work at Washington to eliminate
the southern counties of California from the operation
of the minc'ral lands bill. As was to have been ex
pected, the information has aroused the miners of
that section of the State, and earnest steps have been
taken to protect their rights.
At a special meeting of the Southern California
branch of the Miners' Association a number of reso
lutions were adopted setting forth the reasons why the
mineral lands bill should be made to appbÂ» to the
south as well as to other sections of the State, and
Representative Waters of the Seventh District has
been urged to present them and support them in
Congress. '
The resolutions declare that the mineral products
of the southern portion of California, including gold,
silver, oil, asphaltum, etc., amounted in 1898 to a
value of $6,594,969, while that for 1899 was about
$Â£,561,542; that it is the sense of the meeting that
the entire State should be included in the mineral
lands bill, and that an emphatic protest be made
against the proposed elimination of the southern
counties from its operation.
One of the effects of the resolutions will be that of
giving a wider publicity to the rapid development
made in the, mineral resources of the southern coun
ties in the last few years. A comparative statement
of the output of the mines of the whole common
wealth makes a very good showing for the south.
Thus in the letter addressed to Mr. Waters and ac
companying the' resolutions forwarded to him the
committee declares: "It is safe, to say that the State
produced minerals in 1899 to the value of nearly $30,
006,000, out of which is taken the production ; 'of
Southern California. There will remain about $21,
500,000 for the balance of the State. Of the fifty-two
mineral producing counties of the State a ratio for
the southern counties already mentioned is far above
the average,' which for the same number of counties,
taking into consideration the whole State, is about
$4,630,000; that is. the average for each county of
the whole State is $578,865. while the average of each
of the counties of the southern group is approxi
mately $1,062,500."
The is?ue is one of no little importance, and it is to
be hoped the presentation to Congress of the facts set
forth by the miners of the south will have the effect
of defeating the scheme of the opposition. Tlie min
eral resources of the southern, counties are â¢ as ;yet
hardly understood fully, even by the residents of ."* the
section. Every facility^ should be afforded b/ the
Government for their development,- but at present
serious obstacles stand in the way. Thus the.com
mittee says: "We have not been able to get;at^the
records showing the. contests (where mineral -lands
were involvedâ in, fact, there seems; to be no classi-.
Ned record of those casesâ but, if our memory
serves us right, there have been "a great rhany.'^pro
tcsts filed against the application for. patents to: land
said to be agricultural which was in reality mineral,
and in every case the miner has been obliged to ? fight
the case with. his own resources."' ... '. -',
THE DOOM OF A NUISANCE.
HARDLY any 'feature of the time more clearly
marks the development of artistic taste in this
country and the growing spirit of public irn
luovement than the widespread opposition, manifest,
in all progressive communities against the long es
tablished nuisance of bill board advertising. That
form of defacement of city property and \ rural land
scopes is evidently doomed in the more enlightened
portions of the country, and in all probability it will
ere long be abolished or greatly restricted every
where. -
Even in Chicago, where the commercial and , in-"
dustrial enterprise of the peopled inclines them to look
with favor on anything and everything that tends to
advertise business and promote its activity, there has
arisen; a. strong popular sentiment against any further
toleration of this particular kind of advertising. Vine'
shrewd, business sense of the leading men of the city
has learned that bill board advertising works the
wrong way; that is to say, it advertises the lack of
taste and lack of public spirit in the community much
more than it does business. In other words, the de
facement of the streets by. staring and often vulgar
signs injures the repute of the city to a great degree
without materially, benefiting the men who are fool
ish enough to trust to that method of making their
business known.
As. a result of this newly awakened sentiment there
!ias been started' in Chicago a. movement which, will
in all probability soon place 'the city on an equality
with the best administered cities in the world, so far
as the protection of the streets from the bill board
nuisanceand fence and wall advertising is concerned.
The evil in that city. has been- increasing- for a long
time and has now become well: nigh intolerable. It
has been carried to such an extent that a serious in
jury is done to the property rights of citizens by die
extent to which some men "permit . their walls and
fences to be defaced for the sake of the private <?a in.
Commenting upon the injury done to the commun
ity and to. private property in some cases by. the
proximity' of unsightly bill boards, which in- many
instances eye.n shut out light and air from adjoining
houses, the .Chicago Chronicle says: "It is hardly
necessary to, speak of the impossibility of making
Chicago a . metropolis of artistic exterior embellish
ments so -long- ay these insufferable excrescences are
allowed on public thoroughfares. There should be
.rigid municipal enactment against the alleged Â¦ free
dom; of a property-owner to barter the; rights of his
neighbors for < private, gain. , No ' public-spirited citi
zer will tolerate; a nuisance ion his own premises, and
those who lack public spirit":should-beYmiadefamen
ablt -to the law. 'The 'bill board is 'a,sur
vival of theVcrudest and 'most inartistic} methods of
new and undeveloped communities.'. It has . no place
in a community that makes pretensions to 'metropoli
tan proportions.". : /.Â¦.'â¢"Â¦'.â¢. â¢ Â¦.'-".' jHjfflJHg
â¢Such is the attitude which the more progressive
cities; of the East have now taken toward the bill
board nuisance, and in self-defense fSaS' Francisco will
have _i to follow the example. even inChicaÃo
has the nuisance' beea: carried tcTa" greater extent than
here) and it is high time' to put anVehd to it.'

great consolidation which Caesar haa
planned and Inaugurated. With the order
and peace which Augustus" established
men's minds had opportunity to develop
along the lines of. their natural bents.
Literature blossomed out once more into
beauty and strength and the glory, of let
ters in his reign was such that hU name,
as applied to a literary epoch, has ever
since been regarded a synonym for trans
cendent excellence. The Augustan age of
literature in Rome was. In good reality,
a "golden age."
Â¦ And yet tnat age derived its principal
luster from only two great names. Both
of these were poets. So that while the
Ciceronian age was an age of prose (for
Lucretius, It. will be remembered, was but
little known In his day. The Augustan age
was an age of poetry. The one epoch rep
resented. Indeed, the culmination of prose
literature among the Romans; the other
the culmination of poetry.
Virgil (B. C. 70-19) ranks as one of the
worla's greatest- poets. For many centu
ries he was named with Homer, which, of
course, was to place him in the highest
rank of all. Then a reaction set In and he
was looked upon for a time as somewhat
thin and artificial. Of late years a truer
criticism has placed him back in a posi
tion corresponding closely "to his earlier
one. While not the equal of Homer in
force,. In rapidity of movement, in pic- .
turesqueness or vital interest, Virgil yet
possessed qualities which Homer did not
have and which no other poet showed till
comparatively modern ages were reached.
For with all his brilliancy of objective
description Virgil also was a subjective
poet. He brooded over the prtthos.of life,
"the tears of things," ! to use his own
phrase. His heart went out in pity for
the distresses which fate imposes on hu
manity,. Whereas Homer is as uncon
cerned with the destinies of human be
ings, except to portray them accurately,
as any pagan god upon Olympus.
Virgil is read to-day mostly for hi 3
"Aeneid,"an epic poem,- describing chiefly
the fall of Troy, taking up- the story
where Homer left It In the "Iliad." bui
dwelling chiefly upon the exploits and ad
ventures of Aeneas, a Trojan hero who
after the fall of Troy came to Italy and
became the reputed progenitor of tb*Â»
Roman people. But the "Aeneld" was a
posthumous publication. On his deathbed
Virgil made his last desire that the
manuscript of his poem should be de
stroyed, for though he had been at work
upon It eleven years he Judged that three
years more were necessary to perfect It.
This wish was not carried out only be
cause of the express command of Augus
tus. The publication of the poem was
effected immediately, and so much ap
proved was it by the Roman people that
scarcely a century had elapsed before
Virgil's tomb became, as it were, the
shrine of a god.
Virgil was a poet for all time. Horace
(B. C. 65-8) also was a poet for all 4lme.
and yet he was distinctively and emphat
ically a poet of the age he belonged to.
Tho "Odes" of Horace derived their .ori
gin, their being, their very soul and es
sence from the life of the times they de
picted. Horace is the singular exampie
of a ptfet who Is really not a great poet,
becoming by his art, the infinite felicity
of his art, greaterâ that is to say. cqore
widely read, more enduringly renowned â
than the very greatest of poets. For with
out doubt Horace has been more widely
and more continuously read, more widely
v and more frequently quoted, than any
other poet who ever lived. He owes this
marvelous popularityâ a popularity ex
tending through every age and through
out every civilized country â not to power
of thought or of suggestion or of Inspira
tion, but to an' inimitable aptness of ex
pression which . gives to even mediocre
ideas such lodgment in the memory that
once they are there they are never dis
placed.
There was a time not so very long ago
when to know one's Horace was the shlb
bQleth of culture. Readers of Bulwer's
novels will remember how continually
Horace is quoted by him and by MS char
acters. If men of polite society met any
where their discourse with one another,
their jests, their repartees were sure to
be flavored by Horatfan allusions and
oftentimes, indeed, by direct Horatian
quotations.
That tfrne Is past. The great expansion
of knowledge In these later days has made
the. leisurely study of classic literature,
once the rule, once, indeed. Imperative on
all who aspired to culture, quite Impos
sible. To-day even the professed classical
scholar scarcely knows his Horace as well
as forty years ago the well-trained school
boy knew It. - -
Some idea of most classical authors can
be obtained from translations. Homer, es
pecially the "Odyssey." has been well ren
dered Into English. So. too. has , Virgil,
but with less success. Virgil's art Is too
personal, too characteristic of his own In
dividuality to be adequately transferred
by another mind into another language.
But of all classic authors none Is so im
possible to translate as Horace. His apt
ness of phrase, his crystal-cut deftness
of metrical construction, in a translator's
hands vanish- entirely. The result is prose
âbare, commonplace prose. - Even Bul
wer-Lytton, with all his abounding love
of Horace, with all his wealth of classical
scholarship and skill in English versifica
tion, made nothing of his attempt. To en
joy Horace at all one must do so In the
original. '
Besides Virgil and Horace there were
other ornaments of literature In the
Augustan age. but none, of course, who
approached these two. Ovid (B. C. 43-A.
D. 6.) a younger member of the Augustan
group, was a more typical representative
of the ideas and manners of the Augustan
age than even Horace. But Ovid, though
a poet of exquisite felicity of expression
and almost unequaled narrative power,
does not rank and never has ranked with
his older contemporaries. -
Another great name of the Augrustan
age was Llvy. IJvy (B. C.59-A. D. 17)
was not. a poet. He was a prose writer
and one of the first rank. He was a his
torianâup to his time the greatest of
Latin historians. Llvy 'was not ' critical.
He was not exact or painstaking. But he
narrated history dramatically and gave
to the world pictures of men and manners
which, if not true to actual fact. are. like
Shakespeare's -dramatic histories, accept
ed by the world as truer in their general
1 correctness of portraiture than the narra
tives; of more technically, accurate his
torians. . Â¦ . â¢
There was, a little later, on. a third
epoch of Roman literature, not inconsid
erable 'in Ita greatness by any means. It
continued for a number of years â for some
distance Into the second century, indeed.
It included Seneca, the philosopher: Mar
tial, the epigrammatist:" Pliny, the natur
alistâ"the most learned man of his ajre,"
as he. was -justly called: Tacitus, the his
torian: Qulntillan. the rhetorician, and
Juvenal.. the satirist. Of these the mast
worthily renowned was Tacitua. Tacitus
(A. D. 61-117?) has been aptly called the
Latin <â¢ ' Carlyl*. The piercing, scorching
phrases by which he transfixed a charac
ter and showed the evil lurking within or
lit un as with strokes of, lurid color bl3
usually somlwr and : awesome portraiture
of the , fateful procession i of historical
events, are unique in literature.' Tacitus,
indeed, in, his way. was one of the great
est historical writers tha world baa
known. Â¦

HORRIBLE THREATS
MADE BY C. L WHITNEY
Unhappy Belations of a Man and
Wife Disclosed in Judge Mo
gan's Court.
A case showing the unhappy relations
existing between Charles C. L. Whitney
and his wife Kate came up for hearing
irv Judge Mogan's court yesterday, the
wife charging the husband with threat
ening to kill her. Mrs. Whitney testified
that she separated from her husband in
Illinois, July 16, ISOS. She with her four
children have been residing with her sis
ter, Mrs, Ed Anderson, 507J4 Hyde street.
Her husband has a suit pending against
her sister and brother-in-law for alienat
ing her affections.
Fie met his wife at Ellis and Jones
streets last month and asked her if she
intended, being a witness in that action.
She replied in the affirmative, when, she
claims, he said: "You look out for your
sell. The life line is drawn and if you
appear against me I will kill you. I have
got a long knife as sharp as a lance, and
I will rip Anderson and make a grand
entrance up thÂ« stair* and slash your
sister also and will make threads of them
In "cross-examination, she said that she
was to apply for a divorce from her hus
band. She had commenced a suit for sep
arate maintenance the day after her ar
rival here. He had written letters, ask
ing her to forgive him, but she refused to
do so. Â¦ â¢ . *
The case was continued till this morn-
Ing, when Whitney's counsel promised to
prove that the defendant was dying from
love of his wife, who was kept from him
by her sister. Â¦ -'

Embezzlers, forgers,, defaulters and
other victims of racetrack gambling will
do well for themselves not to seek the
land of the Aztecs as a hiding place from
the ofllcers of the law. for it appears by
a letter received yesterday- by Captain A.
de la Torre,' Spanish interpreter for, the
Immlrration Bureau â¢ In this city, that
fugitive Americans are tried In the Mexi
can courts and are sentenced to confine
ment for . the same iin Mexican prisons,
which are not noted for fresh air or
cleanliness.
The letter is from Chester W. Rowe and
is dated' from Belem prison in the City of
Mexico. The writer says that while serv
ing his second term as County Treasurer
in Porneshiek, lowa, In 1895, he became a
defaulter, " having too many political
friends and never having been able to say
no. He left his wife and children there
In a destitute condition and fled to the
City of Mexico, where, by the advice of
an acquaintance, he took out citizenship
papers for the purpose of avoiding extra
dition. A Grand Jury In lowa Indicted
him and a short time afterward he was
arrested by "the Mexican authorities and
cast into Belem prison for the crime of
"peculado," or embezzlement of public
funds. In lowa. He was convicted of the
charge and sentenced to serve a term of
imprisonment in a Mexican prison for
twelve years and two months and to pay
a fine of $2000. He has appealed to the
courts and they have affirmed the Judg
ment, and the matter is now pending in
the Supreme Court.
Mrs. Rowe called recently upon Secre
tary Hay, and he informed her that her
husband had been convicted of bringing
stolen property, into Mexico, the stolen
property being part of the funds he took
with him from lowa-
Mr. Rowe does not think that It is good
law to convict and imprison a man In
Mexico for a- crime committed in the
United States, and insists that Secretary
Hay. has been misinformed as to the na
ture of the charge upon whio,h his con
viction was had. ' â¢
GOLDEN AGES OF* LITERATURE.
IX. THE GOLDEN AGE OF ROMAN
LITERATURE.
BY JOHN EBENEZER BRYANT, M. A.
There are two epochs In the history of
Rome when literature shone resplendent.
The earlier epoch was that of Cicero and
Caesar. . It is generally spoken of as the
Ciceronian age. The later epoch was that;
of Virgil and Horace. This epoch Is gen- ;
erally called the Augustan age. â¢ â¢
The, history of Rome for the fifty or
sixty years that ended with the death" of
Caesar was a fearful thing. No modern
history parallels it, except that of France
for a little while during and just after the
Revolution.- There was no leisure, no
room, no possible chance for the develop
ment of the literary Bpirit as a factor of
general culture. 'The nationâ lf Rome at
that time can be called a nationâ was
wholly engrossed in the turmofls, the em
broilments, the upheavals of fierce inter
necine struggle. And yet.out of the chaos
of those times were developed two liter
ary products that had the quality and
| matter of universal fame in them.
Cicero (B. C. 106-43) was a great manâ lf
mere Intellectual qualities be considered,
VIRGIL.
one of the very greatest men of antiquity.
He was an orator, a pleader at the bar.
a parliamentary debater,- a scholar, a
critic, an essayist In polite literature, a
philosopherâ all of the first rank; and as
such he has always been regarded. His
main ambition, however, was to be a
successful practical politician. In this he
failed. His character was not strong
enough, either on Its good side or on its
faulty side, for effectual coping with the
masterful unscrupulousness of Ms age.
In the end his head was struck off, taken
to Rome and displayed In the Senate
Houseâ a proceeding which, though it
seems wantonly atrocious, was only typ
ical of the time.
Cicero is known to scholarship princi
pally for his parliamentary orations and
forensic addresses, his philosophic treat
ises, his essays and his familiar letters.
. These have served as inexhaustible
fields of study for the academic youth of
twenty centuries. But Cicero's greatest
title to fame rests upon the splendid fact
that it was he who by his literary art and
literary power fixed the character of the
Latin tongue as a vehicle of literary ex
pression for the greatest nation of an
tiquity during the whole period of Its
greatness and instituted models of style
and construction which all subsequent
Latin authors followed. And when we
reflect that the I^atin language was for
sixteen centuries the language of the
whole civilized world this great achieve
ment of his measures up to a much
greater magnitude than even first ap
pears. .Indeed, it is scarcely too much to
say that the models of literary style and
rhetorical construction which Cicero set
up are the models which have been ac
knowledged wherever oratory Is practiced
or literature written right up to the pres
ent day.
Caesar (B. C. 100-44), the other great
name of the Ciceronian epocjh of Roman,
literature, was a greater man than even
Cicero was. Caesar was. Indeed, the
greatest man In all antiquity. And, unlike
the case of Cicero, the more critically
Caesar's character and achievements are
studied the greater do they measure. He
was a great general.' a great statesman,
a great empire builder and codifler of
law: also a great politician and orator.
In literature, however. Caesar was great
not because of conscious effort spent, on
literary, labors, but through the sheer ln
evitableness of genius. His only literary
labors, so far as the world now possesses
the fruits of them, were his anonymous,
or, rather, impersonal, records of his
own exploits in war. And yet these sim
ple records â "notes," as he called them, or
"commentaries," as we now sayâ were in
his own time, and have ever since re
mained. In succinctness, perspicuity arid
brilliancy of phrase, the. despair of all
who tried or have tried to imitate them.
Even Cicero acknowledged this.
The age of Cicero and Caesar was ilium-

C. V. S. Gibbs Dies Suddenly

. Death has claimed another of the State's
pioneers. Almost without warning C* V.
S. Gibbs, the well known marine under
writer, was called to his Maker yesterday
morning. He went southa few days ago
for rest and recreation. "While at Coro
nado Monday he suffered a stroke of apo
plexy. Being n man of advanced years
he failed to rally from the attack and the
end came yesterday morning.
Mr. Glbbs was one of the most promi
nent "business men in the city and was
closely identified with San Francisco's his
tory from the days of '49. Although a
man of affairs, he was a devout Chris
tian and was instrumental in establishing
Trinity Church. At the time of his death
he had been connected with the church
for maf e than fifty years.
Deceased was a native of Newport. R. 1..

and was over 70 years old. At the age of
16 he graduated from the Poughkeepsle
(New \ oik) Boys' Academy, and at oncu
entered upon the active \ business life
which has marked his career. Before he
had reached his majority he was In busi
ness for himself in New York as a whole
sale grocer. When the news of tbc Cali
fornia gold discoveries reached the ICasi
he was anfbng the llrst to start for thÂ«Â»
Pacific Slope. With his brother Oeorge
he left New York in January, 1849, for
Vera Cruz. Crossing Mexico to Maz.it lan
they sailed in the Hamburg brig Antonio
for San Francisco, reaching here April 24,
1549.
Mr. Gibbs at once struck out for the
mines at Murphys Camp, but one day's
experience with a pick and shovel was
enough for him and he returned to the
bay. He entered into partnership with
E. E. Dunbar and the firm opened a gen
eral merchandise store on .Washington
street, in the rear of the old City Hall. A
fireended the existence of the firm. -Mr.
Gibbs engaged in several mercantile enter
prises until ISG9, when he -became an ad
juster of marine losses, which profession
he followed until his death.
He was a trustee In many of the reli
gious and benevolent organizations of the
city, and was also a member of the Pio
neers, of which h<s,was a past president. He
was connected with the Sansome Hook
and Ladder Company of the old Volun
teer Fire Department, and was one of the
leaders of the Vigilance Committee.
Mr. Gibbs was married in 146 at Brook
lyn. N. V.. to Miss Harriet E. Forbes.
Besides the widow deceased leaves four
childrenâ William C. and Harry T. Gibbs,

Butter, Eggs and Cheese.
The war In Eggs continues, and though yes
terday' s receipts were . 1200 cases at the , lowest
calculation and .the! heaviest this year, the
market continued stiff,' some dealers quoting
sales up to 20c. It must not be forgotten that
the present rise Is purely artificial, and that
the market. If It had been left to Itself, would
never have risen as It has. When the dealers
get through fighting and leave the market
alone It will probably settle down again. There
are plenty of. Eggs here. . 'â¢'â¢-Â¦im.

London Market.
NEW YORK, March' 14.â The Commercial
Advertiser* 1 London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were very Idle -.and weak
in tendency to-day, due to disappointment - at
the public's apathy, the markets having count
ed on . a strong revival â¢of speculation when
the v war loan success was established. There
were very large dealings In the loan, one dealer
giving 1% premium for allotment letters for
a million. The same dealer was said to have
applied for twenty-seven millions for a syndi
cate. American applications reached fifteen
million. The premium to-day was easier. 1 %
to 2 on the disappointment over the Chancel
lor of the Exchequer 1 * statement last night
that applications were already ten-fold the
amount required. But this Is probably a con
servative estimate. It 1* estimated that when
the list. closes applications will be fifteen-fold.
Consols "were steady.
Americans were heavy and stagnant, except
Atchisons, which New York bought and then
sold. London regards the currency bill as
having been over-discounted. Coppers were
weak In the fall of over a pound In the price
of the metal. New York sold Anacondas.
Paris sold Tintos. There was some talk that
coprer was likely to break heavily. The Bank
of England received Â£55,000 gold from Holland
and Â£11 000 from Portugal and bought Â£6000
in bars. Rio took Â£40,000. Money was un
changed, but loans were brisker, the Bank of
England doing less, however.

TJie Currency Bill.
ITS PROBABLE EFFECT ON THE CIR
CULATION.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews cayÂ»:
â¢â¢In a few days the currency bill will become
law, and the banks will complete their prepara
tions for expansion of the currency. We are
not among those who expect any huge in-
Catlon out of this operation. Some parties pro
fese to ccc an addition of $200.Â«00,000 or $300,000,
000 and over to our currency. Such talk Is
highly injurious and can only harm those who
believe it. Any accurate forecast cf the
amount of new currency Is exceedingly diffi
cult. It is possible that Government bonds
rr.a.y rise to a point where banks would pre
fer to sell rather than take out circulation.
The privilege of issuing notes equal to the
par value of bonds will permit an increase of
over $25,000,000. The effect of the return of
bonds pledged for public deposits in the banks
can hardly be estimated, but It would be con
eiaeÂ»Lble. as the banks now hold about $110.
ooii. 000 of Government funds. There are other
operation* of a technical character which will
adJ to the circulation, making an Increase
which a cafe estimate would place at about
|1(W 000.000. This is a moderate expansion, not
sufficient on which to place any great specula
tive operations, but quite sufficient to act as
a preventive of undue stringency and ss a
moderate stimulus to business activity and
speculation. The passage of the currency bill
is not likely to have any pronounced effect.
It is simjlv a formal establishment of the
Peoples will; it Insures the gold standard.
but do#* not Ftop the endless chain or give
us a scientific banking currency, the struggle
for which In Congress should be renewed with
fresh energy.
"The new 2 per cent Government bonds make
a favorable comparison with the English con
sul* which bear 2K per cent interest and are
selling at 100S, whereas the United State*
consols are 2 per cents and are now selling
at 107 before issued, and are in considerable
demand at that price. There can be no better
barometer of the high credit of this nation
than this showing. No other nation has ever
before been able to float a 2 per cent bond
at 100. Thl* is certainly a proud achievement
lor this country."

CHICAGO. March "14.â CATTLE^-Recelpts,
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 14.â T0-day's stock mar-
V> 1 was largely in professional hands and
trading vat congested In the specialties again.
The professional contingent who have bought
stocks to discount the enactment of the cur
rency law sold to-day to realize. Pressure
from this Â«">urce was not heavy, but the de
mand for Etocks Â«Â¦Â»â¢ bo light that the dribbling
offerings made steady Inroads upon prices,
carrying a few of the standard railroad stocks
off a point during the course of the late trad
ing. The movement of prices In the specialties
was wider, due to special- causes. Sugar was
sold from Boston, where offers were made of
the next dividend l>elow the 1% per cent rate
last Derember on large amount* of stock.
Brooklyn Transit suffered from the refusal of
the State Railroad Commission to defer the
quarterly report. The Rubber stocks felt the
unfavorable influence of the pleasant weather
accompanied by vcories of large stocks to be
carried over until next season. People's Gas
was sold afresh on Chicago orders. The most
conspicuous movement of the day was In Third
Avenue, which sold down to L 6 In the morn-
Ing, but shot up to 66 late in the day after
the publication of the receiver's report, driv
ing the bears to cover with a scramble. â¢ The
stock reacted 3% and fluctuated fe\-eriFhly.
closing with a net gain of 5 points. For the
most part the speculative attitude is one of
continued waiting for the results of the new
financial law to manifest themselves.' A feel
ing of doubt Increased that, however prompt
may be these results, they will not avail to
effort the continued drain during the week on
hank reserves In time to affect the Saturday
bank â¢tatement. This being -the case that
ftatement is likely to show surplus reserves
practically wiped out. To-morrow is the date
*el for the disbursement of quite a large
amount of dividends, including that' of $20 per
thare on the stock of the Standard OH Com
pany. The dividend alone will amount In the
aggregate to $20,000,000. Several million dol
lars additional will be disbursed as dividends
on various stocks. This may reasonably be
expected to have some effect on to-morrow's
money market. To-day's rate for money was
firmly held, but banker* were eager to place
loans for the longer periods, while borrowers
were unn-illlng to bM for any but short-time
loans, clearly reflecting the expectation of

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON,' March 14.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: ,-â¢âÂ¦
The market has continued very dull, and
aside from one good-sized sale reported to have
been made by a certain house In the trade there
has been little business transacted. I The man
ufacturers, as a clays, are not disposed to buy
wool, except where they actually need It, and
the condition' of the money market,, which dis
plays a hardening tendency. Is not favorable for
an extended speculative movement in wool.
Prices are practically unchanged, but on most
grades are largely nominal.
Â¦ The sales of the week In . Boston amounted to
1,724,000 pounds domestic and 183.000 pounds for
eign, making a. total of 1.907,000 pounds, against
a , total of 1,885,000 pounds for the previous
week and a total of 1,871,500 pounds for the cor
responding week last year. â¢ _
! The rales since January 1 amount to 34,408,000
pounds, .against 35.674.000 pounds for the corre
sponding time last year.
London Wool Sales.
. .LONDON. . March 14.â There was a full at
tendance at the wool auction sales to-day and
10,676 bales were offered. The Continent se
cured the bulk of Queensland merinos and the
home trade the majority of New Zealand wools.
A large quantity of crossbreds which were
against buyers went to the* Continent and
America. A fair quantity of Yorkshire ami
Cape of Good Hope and Natal wools .was well
supported by, Germany.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. March 14.â 1t was rather a quiet
day In the wheat pit. May opened %c , over
yesterday at 66c, helped by the caiÂ«h business
done at Duluth and also .here yesterday. The
market touched 65% c early on profit-taking
but steadied, j Near the end covering by shorts
caused a sharp rally which carried May to
65% c. The close was strong. May %c over
yesterday at 66%e.
The corn market opened firm, but shortly
afterward declined on liquidation. The de
cline was recovered near the end, partly in
fluenced by the bulge in wheat. The cash
demand was fair and on the rally shorts cov
ered. Business was rather quiet the greater
part of the session. May closed firm, %@%c
over yeFterday.
The trade In oats was exceedingly quiet. In
fluenced largely by lessened excitement In
corn. May closed a shade Improved.
Covering of May pork was the feature - of
an otherwise colorless provision market. This
influence caused a bulge early, but as sxm
as the demand was satisfied the market re
ceded to opening figures. The clone was steady.
May pork closed 2%c over yesterday; May lard
unchanged and May ribs 2%c up.

TURNED ON GAS
AND GOT IN TO A
BATHTUB TO DIE
Nineteen-Year-OldGirl Tries
to Commit Suicide,
but Fails.
Under a Sudden Impulse Due to Ex
treme Hysteria Erna Rohrbacher
Seeks Death by Suf

Â¦-â¢'Â¦>:>Â¦' â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 14.
While suffering from a lit . of extreme
hysteria,. Erna Rohrbacher; nineteen years
old, residing at 1034 Seventh street,
turned on the gas in the bathroom â¢ and
threw herself !nto the tub this afternoon,
and when found by members of the fam
ily she was unconscious. The sucidal deed
was the result of a sudden Impulse fol
lowing a quarrel.
Physician* were hastily summoned and
by prompt treatment the young wo.nan'a
life was saved. Dr. H. S. Kergan and Dr,
W. W. Kergan attended Miss Rohrbachcr,
and she was reported to-night as out ot
danger.
During the day the young woman had
some differences with her mother over
what were said to be merely trivial fam
ily matters. But the dispute worried the
girl Into a very nervous condition, and
while wrought up to a high pitch of men
tal excitement she suddenly made up her
mind to end her life.
Without warning the. girl went to. the
bathroom and after turning on the gas
got into the tub and prepared to die. That
she was not deliberate in her plans was
evident from the fact that she made no
attempt to close any apertures or crev
ices in the room. The gas was flowing for
some time before the odor of it attracted
attention from those in other parts of the
house. She did not even take the precau
tion to lock the bathroom door and the
search made for the leaking gas led to the
discovery of the unconscious girl In the
bathtub.
After she had been restored to hersenses
the physicians gave her treatent for hys
teria from which she was suffering seri
ously. Members of the family. refused to
discuss the causes of the quarrel which
led the young woman's attempt on her
life. It was said that she was subject to
severe nervous spells at. times.
Miss Rohrbacher is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. A. Rohrbacher. . Â¦
TREATMENT TOO
SEVERE FOR HIS
MENTAL HEALTH
Antone Sylvia Takes Strong
Drugs and Becomes
Insane.
His Physician, Who Conducts a
Chicken Ranch, Convicted of
Practicing Medicine With-*
out Proper Certificate.
OAKLAND, March 14.â Antone Sylvia,
a young rancher near Niles, was com
mitted to the Stockton Insane Asylum on
Friday last as violently Insane on the
recommendation of Drs. Theodore Olm
sted and C. L. Tisdale, acting as lunacy
commissioners. The examining physicians
at that time were unable to discover any
cause for Sylvia's mental derangement.
J. 8. Derosa, known by the title of
"doctor," was brought to the County Jail
this evening under sentence of thirty days
for having prescribed as a physican for
Sylvia when he had no license to practice
medicine.
"Dr." Derosa pleaded guilty in Center
ville to-day to a charge of having vio
lated the State law which prohibits per
sons practicing medicine without having
lirst obtained a certificate from the Board
of Medical Kxaminers..
From "Dr." Derosa's own statement is
is learned that on Sunday, March 4, Sylvia
called on him at his home in Decoto, com
plaining of some skin eruption and stom
ach trouble. Derosa diagnosed his case
as leprosy and gave him several prescrip
tions of the most violent emetics and
purgatives, including pulsatllla and aloes
powders. The druggist who tilled these pre
scriptions asked Sylvia what they were in
tended lor, and he said they were to be
used as "horse medicine."
Exact information as to what was con
tained in these prescriptions Is so Indefi
nite that an opinion can hardy be based
upon it until the prescriptions themselves
can be seen.
Derosa ta.lks about drugs, but with little
idea as to their names or action. He is a
Portuguese, 41 years old, and when ques
tioned at the County Jail to-night frankly
admitted that he had practiced without
a license, but feigned total ignorance as
to what had become of his patient.
"I have been prescribing for the Portu
guese in Decoto and Niles for the pasi
two years." he said in very broken - ng
lish. "and Sunday a week ago Sylvia
called at my chicken ranch saying he' hud
some skin disease. I diagnosed the case
as one of the first stages of leprosy. I
gave him several prescriptions, a 'cathar
tic-emetic.' some purgatives, some pui
satilla for the blood, and after that I pre
scribed two ounces of aloes powders to be
put in a bottle of white or port wine, to be
drunk daily.
"I did not know anything except that I
was arrested, and when the Judge asked
me if I practiced with no license I said
'Yes.' and he said I should pay $50 or go
to jail thirty days. I don't know what be
came of Sylvia."
When asked about this development In
Antone Sylvia's case. Dr. Olmsted, who
acted as lunacy commissioner, said to
night:
"Dr. Tisdale and myself conducted .1
most thorough examination into Sylvia's
insanity. We sifted Into the family his
tory for some trace of mental aberration,
but could find none, and although the man
was violently insane and refused to par
take of any nourishment, we were abso
lutely at a loss to ascertain any cause.
"If It Is true that he was given a violent
treatment of the purgatives and emetics
continuously for" a week, there ts little
wonder that Sylvia refused to eat. Such
a treatment would result in a condition of
starvation, which in turn might terminate
in insanity. We can cite many instances
of where shipwrecked sailors. were foun-1
violently insane through starvation."
The authorities will Investigate the mat
ter.

SAN ANDREAS, March 14Â»â An attempt
waa.made on Monday to hold up the San
Andreas and Mokelumne Hill stage, car
rying the United States malls and Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s express. ;The driver was
William Colton and there are some pecu
liar circumstances surrounding the inci
dent. The attempt was made in Â¦ broad
daylight. 'Just as the driver was ascend
ing a hill about midway between San An
dreas and Mokelumne. At a point of
vantage a masked man, gun in hand,
jumped out from some brush in the road
in front of the horses. With the gun In
his face the driver thought he recognized
tho form and said: "Moro, take that
handkerchief off your face."' The masked
man, however, -still preserved his posi
tion with the gun poised, and for the sec
ond time the driver, who was unarmed,
said: "Take off that handkerchief; that's
you, Moro, I know you."
Tho would-be stage robber then walked
to tho side of the stage, next to the hind
wheel and removed his mask. He proved
to be Peter Moro. a man . about 25 years
old, whose reputation is none of the best.
His pretensions of jocularity to the driver
are not accepted and the mail and ex
press people do not intend .to receive
them. The matter did not become public
until to-day, and meantime Moro has
made his escape, having passed through
Angels to-day. It is understood that a
warrant will be issued for his arrest to
morrow. -
Moro bad a shooting scrape with one
Fritz Shied a few years ago. In. which
both were badly wounded, and has posed
as a bad man ever since and all who have
known him regard him as an embryo stage
robber. -Driver 'Colton said - to-night:

FOUND SENSELESS
ON THE ROADSIDE
]Ylarin County Authorities Believe
Joe Roux Was a Victim of
Foul Play.
Special Dlrpatch to The Call
SAUSAI^ITO. March 14.â A cloud of
mystery surrounds the discovery of the
senseless body of Joe Roux, a French
cook, on the road near Waldo Point last
week, and people here are in doubt as to
whether Roux is the victim of a cowardly
assault or if his condition is the result of
natural causes. Roux was seen to step
off the train at Waldo Point last Thurs
day afternoon. Some hours later a Portu
guese randier found the man lying face
downward in the road between the depot
and the Villa dcs Rosier?, unable to move
or speak. He brought Roux into town
with him, and till this morning, when
John Signeau. owner of a cafe on Bush
street and Grant avenue, San Francisco,
took Roux over to the French Hospital
he has lain in a comatose condition In a
hotel owned by Adam Marshall.
Roux is a great friend of A. Loyez, pro
prieor of the Villa dcs Rosiers at Waldo
Point, and must have met his accident
while on the way to visit him. Loyez is
at a loss to account for the fate which
has overtaken his friend. Roux is, ac
cording to Loyez, a peaceable man, not
the kind to make enemies, and yet several
people of this place express their belief
that Roux's condition was induced by a
blow from a sandbag on the back of the
hrad. If this be so the motive must have
been one of revenge, for $10 In coin and a
gold watch were in Roux's possession
when found. There was also In his pocket
a card with the address "Laurlston Hotel,
room 49, third lloor," written In pencil
on it.
Dr. Mays is at a loss to account for the
man's condition, but does not take much
stock in the violence theory. He' believes
Roux to be the victim of an apoplectic fit
induced by hard drinking. The chances
for Roux's recovery are, according to the
physician, very slim, as the man is com
pletely paralyzed, being unable to move
hand or foot or to* speak. While there are
no marks of violence on the man except a
slight discoloration on the back of the
neck, his condition is analogous to that in
which a victim of sandbag would be, and
the local authorities are still searching for
a clew which will throw some light on the
mystery. L.oyez states that Roux comes
from Portland, that he is single and worth
a considerable amount of money. He had
never heard- of any difficulty between
Roux and any one, but said there might
be one, as he had seen very little of his
friend for some time past. Roux sold a
Bush-street cafe recently, for $2500.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March li
lt'has, finally been 1 settled that the an

place in April, will be held In San Fran

LAST CONCERT
OF THE SEASON
THE last concert given by Mme. Gad
ski, Mr. Bispham and Mr. Damrosch
was listened to and applauded yes
terday by a large and fashionable
audience, such an audience as should
have turned out for the other and
more Important concerts, of the season.
The programme was miscellaneous and
the items about equally divided between
Mme. Gadski and Mr. Bispham. The lat
ter sang "Non plu Andrai" from 'The
Marriage of Figaro," 'and "Creation's
Hymn" of Beethoven with all the gift and
culture that is his, and so magical wa3 his
rendering of the latter number that he re
sponded to appropriate applause with
"When I Was a Page" from "FalstatT.''
His singing of. this encore was positively
tantalizing in the desire it created to hear
him In some other excerpts from the
Italian. He aang; it with brilliancy and
finish.
Mme. Gadski was heard to the best ad
vantage- in her first number, Agatha'j
Aria from "Frelchutz," a beautiful song
which. nowadays we are not often permit
ted to hear sung by such a great artist
as Gadski. In the "Spinning Chorus"
from "The Flying Dutchman," and also
in the duet with Mr. Bispham from the
same opera, Mme. Gadski reinforced the
good impression she has. made upon us.
I must again :say that the insecurity of
her attack which was noticeable last
year has practically vanished, and her
intonation, her voice. In fact, has acquired
both firmness and fullness.
Mme. Gadski's voice is of the purest
soprano quality. She Is the true type of
the dramatic soprano, a classification that
has come to have a dishonest slgniiicance
In its application to "mezzos." Her dra
matic effectiveness, her judicious accent
and modulation, have a purpose born of
intelligence and temperament, and the
more one hears of her singing the more
one enjoys it.
In a cluster of songs by Damrosch,
Franz, Schumann and Schubert Mme.
Gadski hhuk with charm but without spell
or sympathy. Such songs as the "Dfch
terliebe ' and "Dv Bist Die Ruh" are cer
tainly not her forte, and while they were
given with superior care they were not
entitled to the extravagant applause with
which they were greeted.
Mr. Bispham sang three old English
songs delightfully, "The Pretty Creature"
gaining for him unstinted approbation. I
have not been at all moderate in my praise
of this singer, whom I have regarded from
the first as the most important artist of
the group, and this without taking any
thing away from the worth of Mme.
Gadski, which I have recogntzed, nor
from the merit of Mr. Damrosch, which I
have preached; but at the last moment
Mr. Bispham disappointed me grievously.
There were two numbers on last night's
programme which should not have been
there; they were composed by Mr. Dam
rosch and sung by Mr. Bispham. "Man
delay" and "Danny Deever" were the
songs in question and save for some show
of intention in the harmony and well
made accompaniments the compositions
are utterly without value and Mr. Bls
pham's art Is thrown away in their ren
dering.
Aside from the aforesaid "intention" in
the musical treatment/the character of
the airs and that of the words is absurdly
incongruous. "Danny Deever" took the
audience with a gust, but I am not sur
prised that on a certain occasion Mr. Kip
ling left the theater when this composi
tion of Mr. Damrosch was turned loose.
Mr.' Bispham, I regret to say, made an
other bid to crass popularity and lessened
his artistic stature considerably with a
negro dialect song â¢by Paul Lawrence
Dunbar â and Mr. Damrosch. Â¦
"Dich Theuse Halle," from "Tann
hauser," by Mme. Gadski, and the quartet
from "Die Meisterslnger," in which Miss
Decker, Mr.' Williams and Mr. Brown as
sisted capably, mended matters and
brought 'the last concert of a most enjoy
able season to a close.

FUSIONISTS
ARE EAGER TO
GREET BRYAN
His Coming Stirs Up Consid"
erable Excitement in
the North.
Much Difference of Opinion as to
Whether It Would Be Better to
Have Him Speak Before or
After Local Elections.
>
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 14.â Probably nothing
else in the world could have raised such
a hubbub in fusion circles as the coming
of William J. Bryan has done. When it
was announced that he would speak here
April 3 many fusionists declared that the
date should be changed to April 2, that he
might thus speak here the night before
the municipal election. It is their belief
that his speech would help the fusion
cause. Others, Including A. V. Fawcett,
candidate for Mayor, do not want to mix
national with local politics for fear ot
scaring off some Republican votea which
they hope will come to Fawcett.
In t'ae meantime Colonel Blethen of Se
attle had partly arranged that Mr. Bryan
should speak here on April 2 and at Se
attle on April 3. To-night there is a gen
eral disposition among fusionists to de
clare both propositions off and have Mr.
Bryan speak here on April 4 instead. They
admit that they foresee a Republican vic
tory and for Bryan's' sake do not want
the story to go out that a sweeping Re
publican success immediately* followed
his address here. The whole situation
was placed before Senator Turner by wire
this afternoon with the request that Mr.
Bryan's visit be postponed to April 4.
There now arises the question of where
the Bryan meetings shall be held. The
Tacoma and Lyceum theaters have been
engaged, but it is greatly desired to have
one big meeting instead of two small me*.
A proposition is under consideration to
erect a wigwam that will seat 10.1)00 people
between now and April 4. .This- matter
was brought up at a meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce to-night. .Governor Rog
ers will preside over the Tacoma meeting.

CLARENCE A. WEBSTER,
THE ARTIST, IS DEAD
Â«7vP LAM EDA. March 14.â 1n his lifetime Clarence A. Webster, the well
/L-l\ known artist, whose death occurred to-day, often expressed a desire

beauties of the panorama spread before him, and it was his ambition to trans

Mr. Webster's health of late had been poor. He anticipated that death
would soon overtake him, and talked about his fears with his poet friend,
telling him of his wish to be buried' on the heights. Mr. Miller acquiesced,
and to-morrow the remains will be taken there for interment. The funeral
will be held from the late residence, 3127 Central avenue, at 2 o'clock. Rev
George R. Dodson of the Unitarian church will officiate.
The remains nf two of Joaquin Miller's friends are already Interred on his
place, and he has prepared a monument for his nwn grave. ' It consists of a
number of large bowlders piled several feet in height and flattened upon the
top.
Mr. Webster had been engaged in 'newppaper work all his life. He was a
graduate of the irniversity of Michigan. He early developed talent as a
writer and was successively employed with the St. Paul Free Press, Detroit
Tim^s, Pittsburg Dispatch and Chicago Inter Ocean. His artistic career com-
Ynenced with the Pittsburg Dispatch. In 1534 he came to California and located
in San Francisco, and was connected with the Post until his death.

OVER A LARGE
DEED OF TRUST
Wealthy Haywards Rancher
Is Held for Grand
Larceny.
Fraud Charged in the Affairs
of a Bankrupt Firm of
Builders.
Dog- Discovered Hoofs of May's Stolen
Calf and Chris Spreen Is Held
to Answer Before Superior
Court.
Attack Made Upon the Conveyances
of Marcuse & Remmel to the
Puget Sound Lumber
Company.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, March 14.
Chris Spreen. a well-to-do rancher near
Ilaywards, has been bound over to the Su
perior Court to answer to a charge of
grand larceny on the strength of evidence
discovered by a bloodhound belonging to
his accuser, Louis May.
The two men own adjoining farms and
bad blood has existed between them for
come months. About three weeks ago
May missed an eight-month-old calf from
his herd. He immediately suspected his
wealthy neighbor, who, he claims, had
previously poisoned one of his cows and
one of his most valuable dogs. May
frearchf-d everywhere within a radius of
half a mile, even to the wooded foothills,
but ail to no avail.
As a final resource May put one of his
thoroughbred bloodhounds out on the
trail to ferret out the mysterious disap
pearance of the calf. The hound proved
vastly more successful than his master,
for within an hour the detailed canine re
turned, clinching between its teeth the
hoofs and Jaw bone of the missing calf.
The hound had unearthed them from a
small mound scarcely two hundred feet
distant from Spreen's ranch.
Elated over this clew May conducted an
Investigation and learned that the car
cass of hl>" calf had been sold to a local
butcher, and he proposes to show at the
trial in tne Superior Court that Spreen
vks the seller.
Such was in brief the gist of the testi
mony given at Spreen's preliminary hear
ing in Justice Pimental's court at Hay
ward. 1 ' to-day, and on its strength Justice
Quinn. who acted for Judge Plmental.
held Spreen to answer. His bonds were
fixed In the sum of $500.
t
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 14.
Contest has been begun over the busi
ness affairs of Marcuse & Remmel, the
Alameda contracting firm, which was de
clared bankrupt a month ago, with debts
of nearly JIM.uOO. Attack has been made
upon a deed of trust given to the Puget
Sound Lumber Company for 530.725, and
William F. Kroll, the trustee appointed
by the United States District Court, has
asked permission from the court to sue
the company and George \V, Fisher, man
ager, to set aside ;he trust deed and to
prevent the sale of any of the property
until the validity of the deed in deter
mined.
The petition charges fraud On the part
of the alleged insolvent Jinn and recites
that the deed of trust was made when tht
members of the tirm knew they were in
solvent, and that the condition" of affairs
was also known to the lumber company
T^ie linn showed in Its petition in Insol
vency that It owed $i:Â«,S5<) and that the
estimated value of securities pledged on
the debts was J197,&y3, leaving an cquitv
are $C7(J2' Th 6 unÂ£ecured debts of the tlrrn
The Puget Sound Lumber Comnanv's
claim Is 127.0C8. This is secured bythe
trust deed, which Is dated October 25 I*3B
but which was not recorded until I>ece"m'
ber 27, 1599, or less than sixty days befdre
the firm went into insolvency.
The charge is made that the deed Is an
unlawful preference. The trustee also de
clares that the claim of the Puget Sound
Lumber Company is not $27,000. but that
the indebtedness is a much smaller
amount.
The trustee Fay?: "If the trust deed
was executed when It purports to have
been the company by withholding it from
record induced the other creditors of the
bankrupt to give them credit, which they
would not otherwii** have given "
It is also pet forth that during the whole
time since the execution of the deed the
bankrupts have had the control of the
property, using the same in their own
name with the knowledge and consent of
the lumber company and its manager
and that the other creditors were induced"
to believe and had no reason to suppose
that the incumbrance existed. Hence It is
charged that credit was extended ''which
would not have been given had the deed
been put on record at the time of Its al
leged execution.
Further, the trustee says that after
Marcuse & Remmel had been declared
bankrupts, the lumber company sold the
interest of the bankrupts in the property
the company held for $1100. It is alleged
that the value of the property is largely
in excess of the indebtedness due the Pu
get Sound Lumber Company.
Trustee Kroll also asks for an injunc
tion against all the secured creditor-,
numbering forty-three, to prevent them
from foreclosing any mortgages until the
bankruptcy proceedings have been closed.
The attorneys for the trustee are Reed
& Nupbaumer and B. 11. Griffins of Oak
land.

SHIPS TRACTION ENGINES
TO MINES OF SIBERIA
3 AN\ LEANDRO, March 14. â Ono of the largest and certainly the most important shipment that has left San Lean- ',
dro was sent out to-day In half a dozen cars over the Santa Fe system for the wilds of Siberlal The shipment con
sisted of two of the' largest traction engines in the world and eight steel carriages for use In the mining district ;
of that country, made by the Daniel Best Manufacturing Company of this place.
Not the least remarkable feature of this shipment 'is that it will be sent over 20,000 miles in order to reach a point '
that is but 5000 miles from here if the most direct route was taken. The point where the engines will be used is Reval, In
Eastern Siberia. Were the most direct route to be taken they would have been sent across the Pacific Ocean, but owing '
to the desert and rocky character of the country they will be shipped first to New York, by steamer to Paris, thence to ,
St. Petersburg and then by the great trans-Siberian Railway to Reval.
The machines were ordered from the Daniel Best Manufacturing Company by James Detrick, who has same valua- ,
ble mining concessions in that far-distant land. Each engine is fifty horsepower, and the capacity of each wagon is
twelve tons. Henry Cappeler, an expert machinist, goes with the shipment in order to set them up and superintend their
operation. . '
It has been found very difficult to maintain stock In Siberia. The cost is great and the climatic conditions are un
favorable. In order to do away with the great expense, attached to hauling by animal power Mr. Detrick determined to
resort to traction engines and placed his first order with the Best Company. This is only the first shipment of a large
number that will bÂ© sent to that region. The people of San Leandro consider that it is a great compliment to their town
that Siberian operators should send here and be willing to ship* the engines four-fifths of the way around the world in :
order to get them. 'WANTEDâ Good ; starch girls ' at . 790 ' Bllxabeth

Ordeal With H. M. Bryant.
Attorney Pierson was followed on the
stand by H. i. A . Bryant, the man of many
lodgings and peripatetic idiosyncracies.
On cross-examination by Pierson an at
tempt was made to shatter the credibility
of the witness, who testified on Tuesday
that he was in the office of James G. Fair
in this city during the latter part of May
or first part of June, ISS2, when Mrs. Cra
ven-Fair appeared on, the scene and was
Introduced Dy the â¢ Senator as his -wife.
He clung fast to this, -with many protes
tations of reverence for truth. Bryant
said he was asked by the Senator to keep
the matter a secret, which he did- until
two weeks' ago, when he revealed it by
way of letter to -the Pence brothers. .
â¢This letter was in the inside pocket, of
Charles Pence, tearing his very vitals out
for an introduction among the exhibits.
The Fair attorneys took the bait and
called for it, after which it was read and
labeled with the rest of the exhibits. *' In
the letter Bryant speaks of Mrs. Craven-
Fair and says that he has something of
vast Importance to communicate to- her
attorneys. He did not want his name' men
tioned, for fear of the. "murderers, thugs,
detectives" and. other sundry diabolical
agencies that would be put upon his track
If he. disclosed what he knew.' V*
Attorney Pierson, in Â» trying to squash
his credibility as a witness, disclosed some
rare and reeking San Jose politics. - It
seems that Bryant was -arrested in San
'Jose in the fall of IS9S on a charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses. At
that time he was employed to solicit sub
scriptions for the ..Volunteers of America,
According to his own testimony he: acted
in good faith, but through a change of
management -. a misunderstanding hap
pened and he was inextricably mixed in a
deal with politicians, lawyers, judges and
bribe-takers. He remained In jail a
month and then his case was * dismissed.
Star Witness of the Day.
Mrs. Sarah E.- Johnson, the star witness
of the day, then took the stand. Mrs.
Johnson is proprietress -of the ; Colonial
Hotel. She is a lady of solid appearance,
and her testimony was given with an air
of substantial truth, causing the attorneys'
for the heirs to draw their heads together
more than once, i- She , has : known Â» ; Mrs.
Craven-Fair well from the seventies, Â¦ and
testified to her residence in the > Colonial
in 1891. It was in the fall of 1892.' as Mrs.
Johnson's testimony goes, when Mrs.? Cra
ven-Fair visited her at the hotel and held
before her eyes for Inspection the contract
of marriage. The Â¦ document was ' shown
Mrs. Johnson in court I yesterday -and sho
Identified it. The witness couldinotsfix
the date absolutely, -but she; thought the
Incident occurred about a year after Mrs:
Craven left the hotel, which "was in "the
fall of. 1891. Of one thing she was certain,
that it was prior to | Senator Fair's death.

Solicits loans on mortgages or trust deeds

WTien the defense begins its end of the
case to-morrow the attorneys hinge their
evidence upon the allegation that the con
tract Is a forgery, pure and simple. Their
show of indifference to the testimony of
Mrs. Johnson foreshadows in a measure
their declarations as to the time the for
gery was committed. One. of the attorneys
on the Fair side said yesterday that they
will show that the document was executed
before Fair's death and the scheme was
laid prior even to the date on its face.
They claim that they will expose a gigan
tic scheme of forgery and an attempt to
loot the Fair estate, concocted in cold
blood before the Senator's death.
The morning session was a court battle
for the attorneys on both sides, calling for
all the windy vaporing* and short ora
torical displays that the gentlemen of the
law had been anxiously craving for a week.
After an attack on a morning paper by
Abe Ruef because one of Mrs. Craven-
Fair's witnesses had been spoken of as
a "hobo," a wanderer from hotel to lodg
ing-house and from lodging-house to un
furnished rooms. Attorney. Plerson was
called to the stand for interrogation on
the whereabouts of Senator Fair's diary,
from which It is claimed the leaf was
taken which bore the Imprint of the mil
lionaire's writing when he Inscribed the
note to Mrs. Craven In the Grand Opera
house in IS9I.
questions nrea-atnim by the Pence
brotherhood, McEnerney's objections were
sustained, and the rulings of the court
threw a cloak of protection over the much
wanted diary .and personal books of the
late James G. Fair.- All- the insinuations
and indulgence In Innuendo by Attorney
I^afe Pence in regard to the books or their
keepers were of no avail. Attorney Pier
son .eft the witness stand not even a
wiser or a sadder man.. The books, the
existence of which McEnerney would not
even admit/ were nqf" produced and the
cross-fire of Lafe Pence- went for naught.
So far the attempt- of the petitioner's at
torneys to show that the slip of paper on
which was written . the words, "Mrs
fettle R. â Do you know your name?
James G. Fair," was torn from the Sena-"
torn alary has not been proved. But the
Craven-Fair attorneys did not stop here
They attempted to locate the books in the
keeping . of several confidential employes
of I- air and Insinuated that several of
them were bribed by the Fair attorneys
since the beginning of all tho Ipo-ai tnrnri^
Pierson was a very good witness for his
own side, and despite the - battery! of
LAFE PENCE, leading counsel for
Mrs. Nettie Craven-Fair, arose from
his seat yesterday afternoon just be
fore adjournment of the Fair case
and informed Judge Troutt that the
attorneys for the petitioner would finish
the presentation of their side of the case
ln the next twenty-four hours. Mrs.
Sarah E. Johnson, a new witness, had just
finished her testimony. To-day's proceed
ings will consist of a re-examlnatlon of
old witnesses and a general sandpapering
of Mrs. Craven-Fair's cause as expound
ed by her attorneys during several weeks
of painful and laborious direct and cross
examination.
The moat important witness of the day
was Mrs. Sarah E. Johnson, who testi
fied that Mrs. Craven-Fair had exhibited
to her the contract of marriage. She oc
cupied the stand but a brief half-hour,
giving testimony that provoked a series of
questions in the cross-examination, outlin
ing the defense of the respondents.
This was not Mrs. Johnson's first ap
pearance in the interminable Fair litiga
tion. When the pencil wills were bitterly
fought over before Judge Slack she was a
familiar figure on the witness stand, but
little or no attention was called to this
by the attorneys ln their ferreting work
yesterday afternoon. '
f ense finally." had to let her go with her
testimony unshaken. - * :Â¦.Â¦Â¦
During the afternoon the objections of
attorneys came so thick and fast that
Charles Pence wanted the protection of
the court. He said one of his most Im
portant witnesses, Jerome Colwell, "faded
away" because of the time consumption.
He could not wait his turn, so he left for
Los Angeles, apprising Pence of his ac
tion by a telegram received yesterday.
The trial goes on to-day.
STRONG TESTIMONY
AGAINST SIMPTON
John Falconer Says the Judge Told
. . Him Years Ago of Craven-Fair
Marriage.
John Falconer, secretary of the Ancient
Order of Foresters, was the first witness
called by the Grand Jury yesterday in the
investigation of the vague charges of bri
bery and intimidation growing out of the
Fair-Craven, case. - Falconer testified that
several years ago. In conversation at his
office with former! Justice â¢ Simpton of
Sausalito. the latter had remarked, that
he knew that Fair and Mrs.' Craven were
husband and wife. Falconer stated that
Simpton did not say that he had married
the couple, but that he knew that a mar
riage had been performed. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦
Attorney George A. Knight, armed with
the records of the Supreme Court, gave
evidence unfavorable to the contention of
Mrs. Craven-Fair that she is the widow
of the deceased millionaire. He read from
the records where the plaintiff had sworn
to the alleged marriage contract as hav
ing been executed on different dates, and
also quoted portions of Judge Slack's de
cision. ; .
â¢ Thomas Boyd. 'a friond of Louis Du
nand; stated that It was at the request
of Dunand's wife that he took him off the
steamer in a launch upon his return from
Mexico. .'--I â¢ Â¦
Judge Simpton was recalled and denied
positively that he had ever stated to Mrs.
E. Roy or Falconer: that he knew some
thing about the marriage of Mrs. Craven
to Fair, or that he had ever asserted that
they, were married.
Air adjournment was taken until next
Wednesday afternoon, at 2 o'clock, when
the examination of witnesses will be con
cluded. .

READY TO SIGHT ITS GUMS
Daughter of >the;l
Gallant Cavalry 1
Leader Will Not
! Divulge the Name Â«
of Her Fiance. \
LIEUTENANT W. W. FISCUS Is not
the fortunate one upon whom Miss
Annie . Wheeler will bestow [ her
heart and hand. A man unknown
in army or public life holds the
promise of General Wheeler's youngest
daughter, and the wedding of the happy
pair is only a question of a few months.
Miss Wheeler, herself admits the soft
impeachment, but the name of the lucky
man she absolutely refuses to divulge.
."I am going abroad next month," she
said, "to join my sisters, and upon my
return the wedding will take place, al
though as yet no date for our marriage
has been decided upon."
The young bride-to-be, who has just re
turned with her celebrated, father irom
Manila has much of interest to tell of the
boys in blue in the land of the Filipino. â¢
"My 'reasons for going to Manila,', said
Miss Wheeler, were twofoldâ to be with
mV father, for whom I would travel the
wide world over, and to relieve the suf
fering of the boys in blue. To. do this. I
give up home, society and friends.'.'
Miss Wheeler served ln the Red Cross
Hospital -Auxiliary No. 3, of which Mrs.
Whitelaw Reid is chairman, and while not
being a trained nurse, her hospital expe
rience during the Santiago campaign
served her in good stead. She was the
only nurse ln Auxiliary No. 3 of the Sec
ond Reserve at Manila who gave her time
and energy to the sick and wounded with
out remuneration. Of the nobility of the
women of . the Red Cross, Miss Wheeler
said she could not say too much.
"Their unselfish devotion to duty wa3
more touching than the heroism of men
on the battlefield," the general's daughter
explained. "Not alone did they show
bravery in the sick wards,- but they com
pletely sank self ln ministering to the af
flicted." "
Miss Wheeler related many touching
tales of our sick heroes, and paid the fol
lowing tribute to the private:
"I much prefer to nurse the private sol
dier," she satd. "The officers are grateful
for. attention, but it is the private who is
always patient and self-sacrificing. I have
seen him although enduring torture 3 try
ing to help some poor fellow sufferer bear
his woes." In conclusion Miss WheelÂ«r
said there were about three hundred and
seventy-five beds in Auxiliary Hospital
No. 3, and these are attended by the fol
lowing excellent nurses: Miss . Murray,
Miss Coakley. Miss Burrell, Miss Ziegler;
Miss Marshall, Miss Dockrell. Miss Pope,
Miss Yeakle, Miss Ridley. Miss Frazer
and Miss Summlo. Miss Henshall is ihe
very superior, executive officer of the Sec
ond Reserve. She is cool, possesses sound
judgment, wonderful physical endurance,
and deserves to be a major general. . Â¦
