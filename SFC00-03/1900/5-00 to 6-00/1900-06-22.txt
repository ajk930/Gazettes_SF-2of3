will be a special train, stops at
important points, brass bands,
shooting matches, sweet cider
and other things, and for the first
time the long-haired free silver
friends of Mr. Bryan will be met
on their own ranges to be told
the truths about the Amercian
flag, the American nation and the
American dollar.
In the middle of July the Gov
ernor will take another trip, go
ing this time into the Northwest.
He will attend the National Con
vention of League Clubs at. St.
Paul, Minn., and may on this oc
casion make ; a dash into . North
Dakota, South Dakota, Montana
and- possibly Idaho. Of course,
on this trip he willTbe seen once
or twice in Nebraska.
There was no fight in the con.
vention over anything except tht
honor of making speeches for the
successful candidates. -;.?;.
Quay and Â¦ Hanna . made up
their differences and there was no
contest over the Quay resolution
restricting Southern representa
tion in the ' convention. Quay
kindly , abandoned his \ resolution
when. Hanna accepted'Roosevelt;
and, the only danger that con
fronted harmony passed away. '
> Quay, like Platt, emerges from
the convention with much re
nown among his followers. These
two men were the only ones who
played good politics in the con
vention. Platt has the honor of
having nominated Roosevelt
against the deliberate opposition
of Hanna, and Quay has the
credit of sharing- the Roosevelt
boom which resulted in ' Senator
Hanna's capitulation last night.
Whenever Quay appeared in
the convention, whenever he
arose to make a motion or. change
his seat, he was . greeted with
great applause. When he came
to the. convention he was regard
ed : J .s a dead politician. He is
to-night looked upon as once
more, a commanding factor in
Pennsylvania ; politics. ; Even his
enemies admit that during, the
A ALL HEADQUARTERS,
I HOTEL WALTON, PHIL
ADELPHIA, June 21.â Mc-
Kinlev and Roosevelt are the Re-
publican candidates. They were
nominated to-day for President
and Vice President respectively,
not in stampede, but in formal
manner, showing that each was
the deliberate choice of the con
vention. No other candidate than
McKinley was considered for
President. No other candidate
than Roosevelt, was considered
for Vice. President-. .McKinley
got all the 926 votes in the con
vention. " Roosevelt' got all " but
one â his was* the* one vote "not
cast. To the end he remained
sincere in- his belief that some
body else ought to be nominated,
and carried home with him the
satisfying knowledge that he- was
the only anti-Roosevelt man in
the convention.
Mark Hanna is again : to be
manager of the campaign. Ten
minutes after the convention ad
journed he was elected chairman
of the new national committee.
Work is to be begun at . once.
No time is to be lost. Candidates
are to be notified, on July 12,
within a week after the Bryan
ticket has been placed in nomina :
tion. 'S'V, V;
The campaign is to be man
aged, as usual; by a selected com
mittee and there is to be an ad
visorv or financial committee, of
which Cornelius N. Bliss will be
one of the members.
The battle ground is to be the
"enemy's country." By the "en
emy's country" in Republican
circles is meant the great West â
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and
other prairie and mountain
States.
In little more than a week's
time Governor Roosevelt, at the
head of the charging Western
campaign column, will be invad
ing the "enemy's country."
A reunion of Rough Riders is
to be held in Oklahoma the first
week in July. Governor Roose
velt will attend it. The occasion
will be seized to make a demon
stration. The Governor will go
through Kansas City on his way
to the reunion. He will return
on July 5, just about the time
Brvan is being nominated.- There
McKinley was placed in nomina
tion by the dashing Foraker of
Ohio, and the standards ot all
States traveled to the stage,
where they were grouped about.
Mark Hanna led the cheering
and waved a Â¦ bunch of pampas
grass tied -to the end of a broom
stick. The demonstration lasted
nearly ten minutes.
Governor Roosevelt's speech
seconding McKinley V nomina
tion was the signal for another
demonstration. The- Governor
made the best speech of the day.
If was broad, thoughtful, patri
otic and eloquent. He drove his
knife deep into Democracy and
when, he concluded the, leaders
knew they had ' on the ticket a
man to answer Bryan, should the
Democratic, champion tour the
country,' from' trie' rear platform.
, When air the " speeches ' for 'Me- ,
Kinley-' had been made Senator
Lodge, the chairman, ordered trie
roll of the States to be called for
the ballot/ There was no other
candidate, but it had been de
termined to make the result
proud and clinching. The chair
man of each ' State delegation
arose and cast the solid vote of
the State for McKinley, and he
was declared nominated. ;
The nomination 6f Governor
Roosevelt for Vice President was
made amid scenes of great en
thusiasm. The Governor was the
one popular idol in the conven
tion. "He was placed in nomina
tion by- Iowa. Colonel "Lafe"
Young, an Iowa editor, who was
in Cuba as a war correspondent, Â¦
made the speech. The nomina
tion was seconded by Murray of
Massachusetts, Governor Mount
"of IndianaandiChauncey M. De
pew of New York.
The Governor left for
last week he has vastly added to
his strength.
The concluding session of the
convention took on in a supreme
measure the character of a great
Republican jubilee. Every man,
woman and child stood up when
York this evening in. General
Frank V. Greene's car.
Those on the committee to
present the President with the
gold badge will leave to-morrow.
Judge Van Fleet has been busy
to-night with national committee
work and will go to >*e\v York
and then home, stopping in Ohio
to see his father. jÂ£. D. Rideout
and H. D. Robbins started home
to-day.
The Californians are scattering
fast. George A. Knight leaves
for Washington and San Fran
cisco to-morrow.
Here, at. the Casino, a most
elaborate dinner was served to
about sixty. After the dinner
J. Martin pommel, a prominent
attorney of Philadelphia, acted as
toastmaster. Very graceful and
happy speeches thanking the
committee of Philadelphians for
their uniform hospitality and con
sideration were made by W. ,C
Haddock, director of public
works; Governor Taylor of Ken
tucky, Edgar D. Peixotto and
Sheriff Alexander Crow.
Knight pleased the Califor
nians. to a man. His voice certain
ly was the clearest and best heard
in the convention, . All seemed
much pleased with his speech.
â¢ This evening the Californians
were again the recipients of the
lavish hospitality they have been
so fortunate to receive from the
special committee in charge of
them. At 4:30 four-in-hand tally
ho coaches were at the hotel. The
Galifornians and Kentuckians
were driven all through the city
and out and about Fairmount
Park, and then to the West Side
Park.

Although no definite time has been fixed for the notification
committee to wait upon the President and formally notify him of his
nomination, it is expected that the President has indicated that it
will be entirely satisfactory^ him if the committee would visit him
at Canton on July 12. He and Mis. McKinley expect to leave here
for Canton not later than July" 1, and it is not improbable that tlrsy
may leave in time to reach; Canton June 30. According to present
plans they will remain there through the month of July. It is un
derstood to be the President's purpose not to make any speeches
during his absence from Washington. *

tyranny of Spain, with the same serious realf
zation of duty and sincere purpose to 'perform
it that has marked the nation's attitude in
dealing with the economic and financial dif
ficulties that face us at home.
This is what the nation has done during- the
three years that have elapsed since we mwla
McKinley President, and all this Is what he
typifies and stands for. We are here to nomi
nate him again and In November next wa
shall elect him again, because it has been given
to him to personify the cause of honor abroad
and prosperity at. home of wise legislation and
straightforward administration. We have,
done so well our opponents use this very face
as an excuse for turning us out. We have put
the tariff on a foundation so secureâ we have
Â¦passed such wise laws of finance that they
actually appeal to the patriotic. hone*t men
who deserted them at the last election to help
them now, because, forsooth, we have done so
well teat nobody need fear their capacity to
undo our work. I am not exaggerating. This
Is literally the argument that is now addressed
to the gold Democrats as a, reason why they
need no longer stand by tha Republican party.
To all such who may be inclined to listen to
these specious arguments I would address aa
; emphatic word of warning.
Evils of I>emocracy.
Peace for tha Philippines.
Remember that, admirable though our legis
lation has been during the past three years, it
has been rendered possible and effective only
because there was good administration to back
It Wise laws are Invaluable, but aftÂ«r all
they are not as necessary aa wis? and honest
administration of the laws. The best law ever
made, if administered by those who are hostllÂ«
to it and who mean to break it down, cannot
be wholly effective and may be wholly in
effective. WÂ« have at last put our financial
legislation on a sound basis, but no posslbl*
financial legislation can save us from fearful
and disastrous panic it we trust our finances
to the management of any man who would be
acceptable to the leaders and g-uldes or tne
Democracy in its present spirit. Xo Secretary
of the Treasury who would be acceptable to.
or who could, without loss of self-respect, serve
under the Popullstlc-Democracy. could avoid
plunpins this country back into financial
chaos. Until our opponents have explicitly
and absolutely repudiated the principles which
in 1S3S they professed and the leaders who em
body these principles, their success means the
undoing of the -country. Nor nave they any
longer even the excuse of being honest in their
folly They nave raved: they have foamed at
the mouth in denunciation of trusts, and now,
in my own State, thetr foremost party leaders,
including the man before whom the others bow
with bared head and trembling knee, have
been discovered in a trust which really Is of
infamous and perhaps of criminal character;
a trust in which these apostles of Democracy,
these prophets of tha new dispensation, hava
sought to wring fortunes from the dire need of
their poorer brethren.
I rise to second the nomination of William
McKinley because with him aÂ« leader this
country has trod the path of national great
ness and prosperity with the strides of a
giant and because under him we can and will
once more and finally overthrow those whose
success would mean for the nation material
disaster and moral disgrace. Exactly as we
have remedied the evils which in the past wÂ»
undertook to remedy, so now when we say
that a wrong shall be righted, it most assured
ly will be righted. â¢ ,
We have nearly succeeded In bringing peace
and order to the Philippines. We have sent
thither, as to other islands toward whose in
habitants we now stand as trustees ln^ the
cause > of good, government, men like Wood, 1
Taft and Allen, whose very names are aynony-.'
mous of integrity and guarantees of efficiency
Appointees like these, with subordinates chosen
on grounds of merit and fitness alone, are evi
dence of the spirit and method In. and by'
which, this nation must approach Its new and
serious duties. Contrast this with what would
be the fate of the islands under the spoils
system so brazenly advocated by our opponents
in their last. national platform. The war atlll
goea on. because the allies In this country ot
in a condition of industrial paralysis. Tha
capitalist was plunged in ruin and disaster, th*
wage worker was on the edge of actual want
the success of our opponents would have meant
not only Immense aggravation of the actual
physical distress, but also a strain on tha na
tion's honor so deep that more than one gen
eration would have to pass before it would be
effectually wiped out. We promised that ir
President McKinley were elected not only
should thÂ© national honor be kept unstained a*
home and abroad, but that the mine and th*
workshop would be kept open, the farmer' have
a market for his goods, the merchant for hi*
wares, and that the wage worker should pros
per as never before.
W* did not promise the impossible: wÂ» did
not say that by good legislation and good ad
ministration there would come prosperity to all
men; but we did say that each man should.
have a better chance to win prosperity thin
he had ever yet had. In the long run tie
thrift, industry, energy and capacity oi the
individual must always bÂ« the chief factor in
hia success. By unwise or dishonest legisla
tion or administration on the part of the- na
tional authorities all these qualities in the in
dividual can be nullified, but wise legislation
and upright administration will give them free
acow. And it was this free acope that wÂ«
promised should bÂ© given.
Every Pledge Fulfilled.
"Well, we kept our word. The opportunity has
been given and it haa been seized by American
energy, thrift and business enterprise. As a
result we have nrosoered as never before, aiul
we are now prospering to a degree that would
have seemed incredible four yeara ago, when
-the cloud of menace to our industrial well
being hung black above the land.
f So it has been In foreign affairs. Pour yeara
ago the nation was uneasy becauss right at
its doors an American island lay writhir.gr in
agony with the curse of worse than medieval
tryanny and misrule. We had our Armenia
at our very doors, for the situation In Cuba had
grown Intolerable and such that this nation
could no longer refrain from interference and
retain its own self-respect. President McKin
ley turned to this duty as he hart turned ti
other*. He sought by every effort possible to
provide for Spain's withdrawal from the Island
which she was impotent longer to do aught
than oppress. Thpn. when pacific means had
failed and thfcre remained the only alternative,
we wagfpd the most righteous and brilliantiy
successful foreign war that any country haa
waged during the lifetime of the present gen
eration. It was not a great war simply be
cause it was won too easily, but It waa mo
mentous Indeed in- its effects. It left us. as
all great feats must leave those who perform
them, an inheritance both of honor and of re
sponsibility, and under the lead of President
McKinley the nation has taken up the task of
securing orderly liberty and the reign of Justice
and law in the island from which we dr.>ve the
the cheers began and a wild scene ensued.
Amid a tumult of applause Senator For
aker went to the platform, and when,
quiet was restored, began to speak, first
thanking Alabama for Its courtesy in
yielding, but attributing that fact to the
overwhelming popularity of the candidate.-
As Mr. Foraker continued he was re
peatedly interrupted with cheers. His an
nouncement that the nomination of Mc-
Kinley was equal to election in Novem
ber brought vociferous cheers.
Briefly Senator Foraker adverted to the
record of the President in peace and In
war as one of the most remarkable In
American history- . . ...
"In war and in peace, said he. while
the delegates and spectators echoed the
refrain of the sentiment expressed, he
has been found equal to all extraordinary j
requirements. -In all American history
there has been no chapter more brilliant
than written by the United States with
him as chief." ,
During the reference to the great leafier
of the party, the successes already
achieved by him and the grave responsi
bilities now being carried forward by him,"
the applause was frequent and long: con
tinued. But it remained for his closing
sentence, for the first time mentioning
"William McKinley by name as the nomf
nee, to electrify the great multitade.
Pandemonium broke loose. Former tem
pests of enthusiasm paled before this cy
clone of sound and movement. Every
one stood and waved and yelled. State
standards were wrenched from theli
places and borne aloft with umbrellas, 1
great plumes of red, white and blueâ a.
perfect tempestuous sea of color.
Senator Hanna sprang to the front of
the stage, a flag in one hand and a plume
In the other, and led in the tremendous
demonstration. Now it had lasted five
minutes. Not content with their frenzied
hurrah on the floor, the delegates march
ed in solid ranks upon the platform, with
standards, plumes, banners and flags.
After the demonstration had continued
seven minutes, the Ohio delegation, where
centered the waves of sound, moved up
the aisle, while all the other State deleÂ»
gations, bearing aloft their standards,
formed in a grand procession about thÂ»
hall. The demonstration lasted just ten
minutes.
Indiana started the rush to the^plat
form, Â¦ Governor Mount tearing up the
State standard and leading the delega
tlon down the aisle.
The plume demonstration was followed
by a grand doxology In the singing gf
"John Brown's body," the galleries join,
ing in the chorus while the delegations
led the singing.
Fifteen-lftinute Demonstration.
During the speech of Senator Foraker,
Governor Roosevelt paid attention so
strictly that there was an almost anxious
look upon his face. Once or twice, how
ever, he got away from his intensity ana
applauded. When Foraker finished,
Roosevelt Â¦ arose with the rest, but un
doubtedly with the prospect of his own
nomination on his mind only, stood silent,
not joining in the cheers, and both hands
in his pocket. But when Senator Fora
ker came down the aisle he grasped him
by the hand and slapped him on the
shoulder, smiling and laughing aloud.
One delegate threw off his coat and un
fastened his collar as he reached the plat
form and. holding a plume in one hand,
waved his coat with the other. Bx-Go-Â»
ernor Taylor of Kentucky stood on a
chair In his delegation and waved his
hand as the procession of plumes returned
from the platform.
Cnairman Lodge, as the hurrah began
to subside, made an effort to restore order,
but this was only a signal for the crowd
to again break loose.
It was exactly fifteen minutes when or
der was . restored and Mr. Lodge an
nounced: . . V â¢
"The chair recognizes Governor Roose
velt of New York."
Again the magic of a name set the mul
titude into convulsions of enthusiasm.
All eyes were turned toward Roosevelt.
He stepped out Into into the aisle and
strode up to the platform, looking neither
to he right nor to the left, a^nd then, tut-n
ingr, surveyed the sea of waving, cheer
ing humanity. There he stood, his face
grimly set, without a smile.. He made no
acknowledgment, no salutations to the
plaudits, but like a hero receiving his due,
calmly awaited the subsidence of the
tumult.
At least he raised his hand and at his
bidding the demonstration came to an
end. . He wore a black cutaway coat,
dark, striped trousers, turndown collar
and blue necktie. The delegate's badge
on the red, white and blue ribbon, was the
only bit of color he wore.
As the Governor faced about on the
platform a man with a camera planted
the instrument directly in front of hlm.
As Roosevelt saw it he said sharply:
"Take tnat.aw.ay; take It away, and
a serg-eant-at-arms rushed. the man and
his apparatus out of the aisle.
Eoosevelt's Seconding Speech.
Then Governor Roosevelt began his
speech, speaking in a clear, full voice.
He said:
Mr. Chairman: I rise to second the nomina
tion of William 'McKinley, the President who
has to meet and solve problems more numerous
and more Important than any other President

love feast, a jubilee, and not a contest
which the day was to witness.
Governor Roosevelt entered at 10 o'clock.
He made a rush of it 'to-day, but did not
escape the keen eyes of the thousands.
Foraker's Eloquence in Presenting
the Name of McKinley Arouses
All of the Pent-Up Enthusiasm
of Delegates and Spectators* r
Vast Assemblage Thrown Into a
Tumult of Extravagant Joy
That Continues Unrestrained for
a Full Quarter of an Hour*
"p^fc HILADELPHI A, June 21.â President
I J McKinley was unanimously'renom
|^ fnated for President of the United
J States by the Republican National
Convention at 1:48 o'clock to-day.
and an hour and ten minutes later
Governor Roosevelt of New York was
unanimously selected to stand beside him
*n the coming battle.
The scenes attending the selections
were tumultuous. Such unanimous dem
onstrations in honor of the nominees of a
national convention have never been
equaled perhaps in the history of politics
in this country. It was a love feast, a
jubilee, a ratification meeting.
Then? was a fine setting for to-day's
spectacular drama. Bright peonies at
cither end of the stage made two flaming
bits of. color. Throughout the vast multi
tude fans moved ceaselessly to and fro.
like the wings cf a flock of alarmed gulls
beating the air. There were no prelim
inaries. The wrangle expected over the
question of reducing the representation in
the South was averted by the withdrawal
of ex-Senator Quay's proposition.
'.The great hall became quiet as Senator
Lodge, standing before 15,000 eager faces,
gave! in hand, announced that nomina
tions for President of the United States
were In <^rder. The reading clerk advanced
to the front of the platform. He was
about to call the roll of States for the pre
sentation of candidates. When Alabama
was called a thin, red-whiskered delegate
from that Stat* arcs? and surrendered the
first right to speak to Ohio. A flutter of
handkerchiefs filled the air' and cheer
after cYieer went up from the delegates
in the pit as Senator Foraker of Ohin. the
l<5eal of militant Republicanism, strode
toward the platform. Foraker i5= a yra^nd
looking man. with something of the im
periousness of Elaine and the dash nf a
Rupert about n!m. The r.ir was surchar.crd
Â¦with electricity a? he mrrunfed the st^ps,
and when he turned about, standing there
with pray eyes calmly sweeping the cheer
ing thousands, the magnetic orator must
Shave been conscious of his power to 'call
up a storm that would sweep through' the
amphitheater. Below about him on either
i A Texas delegate shouted above the roar:
"Three cheers for Mark Hanna,"
They were given with a will. Then a
delegate with Ohio's standard in his hand
dove down into the main aisle and went
careening toward the rear to the music ot
"John Brown" s Body Lies Moldering in
the Grave." The bearers of the stand
ards of the otherSfntes plunged after him. .
Down the aisle they swung, parting the
whole stonn afresh. When they reached
the main entrance they- were met by men
. holding a.loft a gigantic papier machc
elephant, with the. national colors twined
about his neck. Then the procession came
back and circled the pit. For min
ute? this parade continued. Â¦
The demonstration all. told lasted ex
actly fifteen â¢minutes. In length of time
it does not compare with the prolonged
cheer which went up for Grant in lsSO, or
Blaine in 1SSS. or for McKinley in 1WH>. It
is also surpassed In length of time T>y de
monstrations at Democratic conventions.
Noisy Tribute to Roosevelt
This protracted outburst was but the
forerunner of the pandemonium that
reigned a moment later when Roosevelt,
the man of the hour, mounted the plat
form to second the President's nomina
tion. When the convention caught sight
cf him it went off again like a rocket.
As he etood there facing the yelling multi
tude, the roar could have been heard for
blocks. Hanna smiled blandly as a dar
ing photographer set up a rapid fire cam
era directly in front of the hero of San
Juan and began banging away at him.
But "Teddy" did not .flinch. He looked
about him while he waited for the storm
to subside. Several times he raised his
hand, but the cheering continued. His
stern, square jaw was firmly pet as he
surveyed the scene. Only once did JMs
face relax. That was when he cau&yt
sight of his wife, who sat In the resrÂ«ved
scats overhanging the pit on his right.
Then he smiled till his teeth showed and
Mrs. Roosevelt flutfered, back her hand
kerchief. When finally he was allowed
to begin he plunged directly to th^-Jjeart
of his subject in the impetuous way
which the people so much admire. His
statement was that he arose to second
â¢the nomination of William McKinley. who
had faced more problems than any Presi
dent since Lincoln.
The convention got on its feet and it
was several minutes before he could pro
ceed. Every , movement and every word
were characteristic of the man. He
looked, rpoke and acted like one giving
direction? Â«o an army about to. go into
battle. And nothing would content . him
but to storm the' heights as he- did- at
â¢Roosevelt is no master of the foil. He
prefers the broadsword, and as he laid
about him with sledgehammer blows the
multitude went wild with deliprhu A Ne
braska delegate shouted, "Hit 'em again.'
He had the manuscript of his speech in
his han.l and referred to it occasionally,
discarding page after page as he finished,'
until the platform at his feet was strewn
with white sheets. -When -he reached his
Peroration -and v.ith a world of infinite,
scorn in his voice asked if America was a
weakiing to shrink from the- world .work'
of the great powers thÂ£ whole pit" echoed .
no in chorus. i Â¦ ' â¢ ' â¢ "
When he had concluded and resumed his
seat in the New York delegation the other'
delegates rushed forward and surrounded^
him. Many embraced him and it seemed
for a moment as if they would lift him to
their shoulders. Senator Thurston, the
Demosthenes of the Senate; John W.
Verkes. an orator from the Blue Grass
State, and Governor Mount of Indiana'
also seconded McKinley's nomination, but
before the latter concluded the convention
was Impatient for a vote and several
times tried to howl him down.
Then the roll of States was called and
delegation after delegation arose in solid
blocks and cast their votes for McKinley.
When Chairman Lodge made the an
nouncement that the President had been
renominated for the term beginning on
March 4. 15*01. there was the same wild
storm which had been raised by Foraker.
and when it was over Ronsevelt s nomina
tion for the Vice 'Presidency evoked a suc
cession of similar demonstrations. Lafe '
Young, who was with Roosevelt in Cuba, i
nominated him on behalf of the State
which had originally come to Philade^
phia for Dolliver. His nomination -was
seconded by â¢ Delegate Murray of Secre
tarv Long's State, and Delegate Ashtcn
of \Vashington. who came here for. Bart
let Tripp. Chauncey Depew wound up the
oratory on behalf of the State which de
clared for Woodruff. Depew's speech
aroused tlfe most Â¦ intense enthusiasm
when he pictured the dazzling dream of
the country's future. During every pause
the band played but one air, the tune
which Colonel Roosevelt had heard in the
trenches before Santiago.
At 2:14 o'clock the convention, which had
done the unparalleled thing of nominating
both the candidates for President and
Vice President unanimously, adjourned. .
Governor Roosevelt- drove from the con
vention hall with Mr. Odell, seated In the
rear of an open landau. He lifted his
broad -brim me<T hat to the continuous sal-'
vo.Â« that prcted him as he passed through
the densely packed streets like a conquer
ing hero . fresh from new victoriej. .To
night the faces of McKinley and Roose
velt are on all the baoses and their names
am on every lip. <Â¦ %
Long before 10, o'clock, the hour set for
the reassembling o f the convention, the
hall was surrounded by an immense army
of people, who. besieged all tlie doors anrl
entrances. clamoring for admission.
When the doors were opened they surged
in like a f^ood, submerging the vast hall.
It was not yet noon, but the sun was j
blazing throuph the roof, shooting dans '
and arrows into all parts of the ha'!. I
"With resonant, ringing voice and graceful I
gestures Forakc-r stilled the noise. Even j
the pages and attendants crouched down j
es they gaz^d at the orator. He b?gan tÂ« i
call up, the hurricane from the Ftart. {
Whenever he raised hi? arms aloft the i
â¢whiPtiins: of the gale ran around th" hall. I
When he said thf nomination had already J
been made, that Walcott and Ixxige and |
the platform had each in turn n/unert his i
candidate, a great ch*er wpnt up. When |
he paid his candidate waÂ« the choice of j
CIIC.1J man who desired Republican sue- j
ce^s In November the roar was like the
ru?h of a heavy sea through a rocky ;
cavern. The orator was filenccd by his i
own word?. Thon ne bogan again,
fp^aklnp as few m"n can. His sudlonoo
was thrilled. They s=at like men under
e ? pell. He dropped a word here, a word
th^re, like eparks upon a sun-dried stub
bie, and when he concluded by placing
?.IcKin!fÂ»y In nomination, not on behalf of
Ohio, hut cf all ihe States and Territories,
a clap of thunder shook the building. Be
low him. all about him were -deafening
roars. The previous whistlings of the
ptorm were but the rustle of a eumrntr
right's breeze.
For a moiarnt the magician leaned over
the platform as if to satisfy himself that
bis -work Â¦was accomplished. Then, see
ing that the c-JTort had been successful,
he retired to the rear of the stage.
The sight was? a srand' and inspiring
one. In the pit the delegates and alter
nates were cheering enthusiastically.
Over the acre? of spectators bedlam
reigned. The hall was r;n angry jea of.
ffising color. Flags, red. white and blue
plumes, shot up as if by magic to cre&t
the wavÂ«-s. . Hats were lifted aloft on*
canes. Umbrellas wore hoisted and
twisted until they rescmbeld whirling
Dervishes. On the press platform the
n*Â»WFpapef mon with watches out were
counting the minutes.
Hanca Leads the Demonstration.
On the stage Senator Hanna. his hand
kerchief in one hand. , a fan in the other,
Â¦was spurring the vast assemblage to new
endeavors. The raging storm did not seem
to faiisfy him. He seized a plume and
whirled it about his head like a general
loading his men to the charge. All at
once a delegate, bearing the standard of
Kentucky, rushed forward to the stage.
The effect was magical. Standards of
the States were torn loose and yelling
delegates climbÂ«*l upon the platform to
rally around their : leader. .With State
guidons pointed to a common center they
made a canopy over the head of th% War
wick of the Republican party. Ohio in
terlocked her staff with New York: Maine
figuratively kissed her hand to California
end Minnesota saluted Texas.
Then higher sHll climbed Hanna. He
mounted a table, where he could look out
upon the chfctins multitude. Be"side-hifn
ruddenly appeared a young girl arrayed
In the national colors. At this fight, the
â¢ cheers redoubled. The music of theor
cheetra was drowned in the awful din.
The demonstration had now continued
Â¦with scarcely a lull for ten- minutes.
Chairman Lodge began to rap for order,
but the ring: of his gavel was of no avail
Â¦Â¦ - V

frantically waving hats, handkerchiefs

McKinley' s Mascot Band.
At 10:20 the big band from Canton, Ohio,
the President's home, made its way into
the hall from the west side and broke out
with the, pealing strains of the national
anthem. The whole audience rose to its
feet and stood until- it was concluded.
The Canton band Isione of the most pop
ular . organizations Â«j of its kind in the
United States. It-Is hereÂ«on the day of
the renomination of McKinley at the
President's own^ request; and he regards
the band, as his' "mascot." Heretofore
in his Congressional and gubernatorial
contests and in 1896, in his contest, the
band played him to victory.^ When it was
suggested that the band could : . not be
present the President insisted that it
should be and at his request the noted
organization was engaged. .'Â¦', Â¦

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Conven

man who . has ably . discharged every responsi

crisis of the great civil conflict in: this country
though but a mere youth, Â¦ displayed the loyalty

man stilled the outcry and recognized
Governor Mount of Indiana, who, on be

nomination of Mr.vMcKinley. It '.was -a
glowing euloglsm to the statesman-soldier
President. - It was apparent that the con
vention-was eager; for definite. results and
a growing hum spread through; the \ hall
as Governor Mount spoke. He said:
Mount's Glowing Eulogy.
To-day he stands as one | beloved at ( home,
before all the nations of the earth and as one
of the greatest rulers that ever graced the
Presidential chair of the United States. '(Ap
plause.) November will soon be here and there
will be' no doubt as to the if suits. The ballots
are now counted In the minds and hearts of
the American people and f our^more yeare of
respect to law, respect to the flag and of hope;
faith in the perpetuity of American Institutions,
and of honor to the name, of William McKIn
ley will follow, this nomination. (Applause.)
All through the acquisition of California they
used the same argument on the stump and in
the United States Senate as is used at present,
and we feel in California the injustice of that
kind of argument, and you Democrats,- if you
want to hear anything about anti-expansion,
get Corwln's speech of 1847 and read it and
there Is not an anti-expansionist in the land
that can make one like It to-day. (Laughter
and applause.) California comes here to sec
ond; California favors with enthusiasm the
nomination of William r McKInley. â¢ j
That man (pointing to a portrait of McKIn
ley) slept with his heart , on the flag and no
Democrat did that In those days. (Tremendous
cheers and a voice. "That's right;- that's
right."):
California is in favor of expansion. "Why?
Because' when the pathfinder (Fremont) crossed
the level Â¦ plains; climbed the mountains of
rocks and viewed the promised land, the
Democratls did not count her as part of this
national Union.
The weary to sleep, and the wounded to die."
It Is going to have a' Fourth of July In .Kan

that our forefathers builded better than they
knew. I eay no city knew better when they
had an opportune of building. (Applause.)
They had the history of the past; they had the
oppression and the Journey that brought them
to these shores. They knew the mistakes of
the Governments of the Old World and they
tried as best they knew to avert and avoid
them in the building of this new and great na
tion. One thing was stamped on their hearts
and their mindsâ freedom to all j and equal
right before the law, and that has been one of
the cardinal principles of the Republican party.
(Applause.) Washington was in favor of pro
tection; Jefferson was in favor of expansion,
and the Republican party assumed those great
principles in 1S56 and never has deserted those
great cardinal principles that have been pro
ductive of so much good. - (Applause.)
The Democratic party I has always put the
arm of labor In a sling* '.(Laughter and ap
plause.) The Democratic party has blackened
the eye of commerce. (Continued laughter.)
The Democratic party has crushed the foot of
progress. It hae put Uncle Sam to bed every
time it has had anything to do with the Gov

sides that it seeks alliance with the vicious and
the outcast of others lands, who have no abid

for ourselvea we propose most genero/sly to go
for them. (Applause.) There could be no more
fitting place for this party to make such &
declaration than here in this magnificent city
Of Philadelphia, where the evidences abound of
the rich blessings the Republican party has
brought to the American people. Here at the
birthplace of the nation, whsre our own dec
laration of Independence was adopted and our
constitution waa framed, where Washington
and Jefferson andxHancock and Adams and
their illustrious associates wrote their immortal
work; here where center so many historic mem
ories that stir the blood and flush the cheek
and excite the sentiments of human liberty and
patriotism Is Indeed a fitting place for the party
of Lincoln and Grant and Garfield and Blalne
(applause), the party of liberty to all men, to
formally dedicate themselves to this great duty;
we are now in the mtdst of its discharge. We
could not turn back If we would and we would
not If we could. (Applause.) We are on trial
before the world and we must triumphantly
meet our responsibilities or lgnominiously fall
In the presence of mankind. These responsibili
ties speak to this convention here, and now and
command us that we choose to be our candidate
and the next President â which Is one and the
same thingâ the best-fitted man for the dis
charge'of this great duty in all the republic.
(Applause.) On that point there is no differ
ence of opinion. No man In all the nation is
so well qualified for this trust as the great
leader under whom the work has been so far
conducted. He has the head; he has the heart;
he has the special knowledge and the special
experience that qualify him beyond all others.
And. Mr. Chairman, he has also the stnlnless
reputation and character and has led the blame
less life that endear him to his countrymen
and give to him their confidence, the respect,
the admiration, the love and the affection of
the whole American people. (Applause.) He Is
an ideal man.' representing the highest type of
American citizenship, an lderfl candidate and
an ideal President. With our banner in his
hands It will be carried to triumphant victory
in November Â¦ next. (Applause.), In the name
of all these considerations, and not* alone on
behalf of his .beloved State of Ohio, but on be
half of every other State and Territory here
represented and In the name of all Republicans
everywhere throughout our Jurisdiction. I nomi
nate to be our next candidate for the Presi
dency William McKInley.'
h* withstood the clamor for precipitate haste
that characterizes rash men who are disposed
to rush unprepared and reckless into conflict.
With a conservatism born of greatness, with a
quality of sagacity that commands respect, and
with tran3cendant ability that challenges admi
ration, he met the issues and carefully pre
pared for the clash of arms that could be no
longer averted. In one hundred dayÂ» he or
ganized and equipped a volunteer army of 25*,
000 soldiers and with only a fraction of thi.i
army he defeated the land forces of Spain, and
destroyed her fleets without the loss to this na
tion of a war vessel and with a loss of men so
small, with results so important, that a parallel
cannot be found In ell the annals of warfare.
The military and naval power of the United
States wad thus exalted before the nations of
the earth, and the name of William McKInley
became honored and extolled by the people of
all lands. Like Abraham Lincoln, our Presi
dent has been made the target of abuse by
men who will yet. In the calmer moments of
candor, extoll his fairness, his efficiency, hta
fidelity and his greatness.
Sons of illustrious sires, who* wore the bluÂ«
and the gray, have unitedly carried "Old
Glory" to victory. They have planted the en
sign of liberty, the flag of our Union, in the
Antilles and In the Orient, there to remain as
a covenant promise of better government to the
Inhabitants.
Mighty problems unforestalled have arisen.
They have been and are now being met in thin
period of transition, the history-making, geog
raphy-changing epoch of the world. We need a
man. we must have a man equal to the grave
responsibilities that may arise. Platforms
cannot forecast policies for unforeseen emer
gencies. s
Ood give us men! A time like this demands
strong minds, great hearts, true faith and
ready hands â tail men. sun-crowned, who HvÂ»
above the foer in public and in private thinking.
This convention has named such a man. I
therefore take great pleasure In seconding the
nomination of him who stands before the world
a clear-headed, clean-handed, strong-hearted
patriot, statesman and hero, a typical Ameri
can, a Christian gentlemanâ William McKInley.
Boll of States Called.
The restive listeners broke In with
many demonstrations and calls of "vote"
and Chairman Lodge was kept busy with
his gavel trying to maintain sufficient or
der for the speaker to be heard. As he
closed the convention again' demanded a
vote and the chairman announced that
the roll of States would be called for the
vote on nomination for President. At 12:37
the vote began.
IHirtng the call of States for the vote on
the Presidential candidate the galleries
were noticeably attentive and there was
no unusual demonstration among the del
egates until New York's vote waa an
nounced by Chairman Od,ell. This brought
out a roend of applause. When Penn
sylvania's vote was announced by Sena
tor Quay many of the delegations arose
and cheered.
Some of the States were not content
with casting their votes for MeKlnley.
but the chairman announced the vote
which the candidate would receive In No
vember.. When Hawaii was called the del
egates stood up and cheered the an
nouncement of Its vote of two for Mc-
Kinley.
The secretary hurriedly made the sum
mary and handed it to the -chairman.
Senator Lodge took the paper and ad
vancing to the front of the stage said:
i "The total vote cast is 330. "William Mc-
KInley has received 930. votes. It Is a
unanimous vote and the chairman an
nounces William McKInley as your can
didate for President for the term begin
ning March 4. 1901."
Again pandemonium broke loose in oaa
swelling cheer of enthusiasm for the can
didate. Up went the plumes and stand
ards. Up stood the great audience, men
and women mingling their shouts In the
frantic demonstration. The band played
"Rally Round the Flag." and the Ham
ilton Club of Chicago marched down the
aisle, preceded by New York and followed
by Pennsylvania.
The huge counterfeit of an elephant,
emblem of Republican strength, waa
brought into the hall. Around Its seek
PHILADELPHIA* June 21.-In nom
inating William McKInley for the
Presidency Senator Foraker - ad-'
dressed the Republican National
Convention as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: Alabama yields to Ohio, and I thank Ala-;
bama fer that accommodation. Alabama has
so yielded, however, by reason of a fact that
would seem In an important sense to make the
duty that has , been . assigned to me a super
fluous duty,, for Alabama has yielded because of
the fact. that our candidate for the Presidency
has in fact been, already nominated. ; (Ap
plause.)- -He was; nominated by -the; distin
guished- Senator -from Colorado when' he as
sumed the duties of temporary chairman.' He
was nominated again yesterday by the distin
guished Senator from Massachusetts when he
took the office of permanent chairman and he
was nominated for a third time when the Sen
ator from Indiana yesterday read us the plat
form.: (Applause.) And not only has he, been
thus nominated by. this convention, but he has
also been nominated by ' the whole American
people. (Applause.) From one end of this land
to the other, "In every mind, only one and the
'same man Is thought of for the honor which we
are now about to confer and that -man Is the
choice of every man who wishes success in the
country. (Applause.) Upon this account it is
indeed not necessary for me or any one else to
epeak for him here or elsewhere; he has already
spoken for himself. (Applause.) v
BRIIiLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS.
And to allÂ» the world has a record replete
with : brilliant â¢' achievements. (Applause.) A
record ..that bespeaks at once both his perfec

both peace and war and constitutes the most
striking illustration of, the inspiring fidelity
and success in the discharge of public ; duty.
Four years ago the American people confided
to 'him 'their highest and most: sacred -trust.
With what results? He found the. industries of

ernment and enjoyment of all the blessings of

Philippines. What haÂ« bnnio gloriously done-
NEW GLORY FOB THE FLAG.
Mr. Chairman, we are not surprised by this,
for we anticipated It all. When we nominated
him at St. Louis four years ago we knew he
was wise, 1 - we knew he was brave, we knew he
was patient, we knew he would be faithful and
devoted and we- knew â¢ that thÂ« greatest pos
sible triumphs of peace would be his: but we
then little knew that he would be called upon
also to: encounter the trials of war. That un
usual emergency came unexpectedly, as wars
generally come. It came In spite of all he
could honorably do to avert It. . It came to find
the country unprepared for it. but found him
equal* to all emergencies (applause), and It Is
no exaggeration . to say that In all American
history there is no chapter more brilliant than
that which closes with him our commander in
chief, our hero on land, and sea.' (Applause.)
In one hundred days -we drove Spain from the
western hemisphere, girded. the earth with out
acquisitions and filled the world with the splen
dor, of our. power. (Applause.)
With a diplomacy never excelled and rarely
equaled, he has overcome what at the time
seemed to be Insurmountable difficulties and
has not only opened. to us the door of China,

South's Tribute to i&Icftinley.
Senator Lodge then recognized John W.
Yerkes of Kentucky, who arose to also
second the nomination on behalf of the
South. He asserted that no convention
had ever been so unanimous for a man
as was this for McKInley. His State had
for thÂ«Â» first time in many yeaj-s a Repub
lican Majority for McKinley in 1896 and it
was going to stay in the Republican col
umn, and the eudience cheered him. Mr.
Yerkes is a straight and tall Kentuckian
with a strong- voice and his speech was
heard all over the hall. Ho said:
Mr. Chairman and Fellow Delegates: The
supreme thought in my mind at this moment is
what remains to be said that ought to be said
and that In time of danger one's thought
naturally turn to his home. I recall that in
the historic â¢ Philadelphia convention of 1S56
liberty-loving men from my State sat as dele
gates in that body. In contrast with this im
mense audience in this huge hall, with Its
splendor of decorations and its superb equip
ment, that gathering would seem to be of small
lmiwrt. but in devotion to freedom, intensity
and in force of utterance. In eternal results
that assemblage has no peer In the history of
conventions. Forty years after thÂ« "conven
tion adjourned Kentucky, for the flrst time
gave her electoral vote to a Republican Presl
tial candidate. Major William McKinley. Rec
ognized as a citadel of Democracy, she had
capitulated to the Republicans in the noted
State campaign of 1595. She was Republican
in 1896, is Republ^an to-day (applause) and
as such seconds this nomination. It would be
gentlemen, but a.fittlng tribute to our Presi
dent and to the Industrial, diplomatic and mar
tial victories of Ma administration if every
State placed the stamp of its approval upon
his course of /conduct; and if opportunity were
given there would Join in this majestic chorus
of national indorsement voices coming
across the waters frcm our new to our old
shores; voices coming from our Insular posses
sions to this venerable city, where a nation was
born consecrated to liberty, to freedom and to
Independence. There is no more fitting place
for this universal chorus to sound forth than
in this old-time city. Now, gentlemen, these
voices that, would come from abroad would
ring at every home from which for the first
time the flag of freedom floats, and that by
the orders of our President.
Liberation of Political Serfs.
Furthermore to-day they are linked to our
progress and to our destiny and therein stable
government, domestic tranquillity and Chris
tian civilization are assured them, ami Jusi'as.
L'.ncolrfs name sounds to the emancipated
slave and his children, so the name of Presi
dent licKlnley will be to these liberated mil
lions of political serfs. (Applause.) We believe
that with the same leadership, the same poli
cies that gave us victory in 1S96, that same
winning will be repeated in 1900. Then it was
a campaign of instruction, or argument, of
promise of better days, of trying to teach the
people to trust and rely on our plans and pur
poses. Now it will be a campaign in which we
will show what has been accomplished,
prophecies fulfilled and pledges redeemed; it
will be a representation of actualities, of facts.
You will have a rapid portraiture, you will
have a shifting panorama of what has passed
anil whether this comparison be made by the
speaker on. the huf kings, by the people's press,
by pamphlet, by the marvelous lines of modern
I progreFf, it will present an argument so for
cible that the minds of the people cannot
escape it. If there be left among us plain,
practical, common, everyday sense, then the
I columns that followed President McKinley's
leadership four years aro will be doubled in
enthusiasm and in numbers this year. (Ap
plause.) In 1S36 we gave you an old representa
tive slave-holding State. By so doing we re
moved one charge against our party that It
was sectional. â¢ The Ohio River was crossed;
Republicanism marched southward and this
sectional line disappeared from the map. We
will do it again. (Applause.) We will still
show the people in the North and in, the South,
and In the Cast, that Republicanismâ to use
the language of our distinguished chairman
means action and is always moving forward.
A Kentucklan, a lover of my native State, be
lieving in the Integrity and honesty of-her
citizens, I have the fullest confidence in them;
I believe they will make final response to every
.argument and that response will be made at
our polls In next November in electing electors
to vote for President. McKinley's re-election.
(Applause.) â¢ -. . -
Knight Makes. a Hit
When Mr. Yerkes Tiad concluded he was
given a salvo of-applause that echoed and
re-echoed through the great hail. As he
turned to resume his seat on the platform
Senator Hanna arose and cordially
grasped his hand. Almost instantly from
all parts of the hall came the cry, "Vote
vote, vote!" Delegates and spectators
were becoming uneasy. They wanted ac
tion, not oratory-
Disregarding a call for 'the vote Mr
-Liodge recognized George Knight, head of
the California delegation. As he appeared
upon the platform and addressed the con
vention his first sentence," ringing through
the great building like a trumpet-call,
caught the fancy of the assemblage and
he was cheered enthusiastically: His
humorous and pungent arraignment of the
Democratic party, for its attitude upon
national questions provoked .frequent
laughter. Said ho: ES83I3
We all know what the Democratic party is.
We all know .4 what the Democratic party was.
We : all ; kno v * what . the ' Democratlo party" will
be until - the crack of doom. . ( Applviso , and
laughter.) I believe that It baa often been said
the bloody insurrectionary oligarchy have
ta.u;rht their foolieh dupes a.broad to believe
that if the rebellion is kept alive until next
November Democratic success at the polls here
v.-ill be followed by the abandonment of the
island* â that means the abandonment to sav
ages who would scramble for what we desert
until forae powerful civilized nation stepped in
to do what we would have shown, ourselves un
Â£t to perform.
Our Eucc-ss In November means peace In the
iFlands; the success of our opponents an in
drnniie prolor.g2.tlon of misery and bloodshed.
We cf this convention now renomlnate the
man whose name is a guaranty against such
disaster. When we place William McKInley as
our candidate before the people we replace the
Itepublicaa party on record a* standing for the
performance which squares with prom
ises, as Ftanding for the redemption
In admlnFtration and legislation of
I. ledges made in the platform and on the
jftuirp, as standing to the upbuilding of the
national honor' ar.d. , interest abroad^ and ihe
cotitinuan'v? at' horat of the prosperity which
has already been brought to the farm and the
workshop.
We stanJ on the threshold of a. new century â
a century bis; with the fate of the preat nations
of the earth. It r^rts with us now to deride
whether :n the opening year of that century
we shall march forward to fresh triumphs, or
â¢whether at the outset we shall deliberately
cripp'-e ourselves for the contest. Is America
a weakling, to shrink froa the world work that
nrast be done by the world powers? No. The
young plant <tf the West stands en a continent
stt} clasps the crept of an ocean in either haxid.
Our nation, plorftus in youth and strength,
S-xikB into the Tuture with fearless and eager
eyes, and rejoices as a. Etran* man to run a

We do not stand in' craven mood, asklntr to

the right to win such honor and renown as has
never yet been granted to the peoples of rnan
hinJ.
The sentences were delivered in a man
ner that denoted a careful study of each
word. Ills argumentative style kept the
audience en rapport with him. for he was
driven the closest attention by the vast
audience â in fact very much more atten
tion than had any other speaker.
When he declared with brilliant em
phasis that the fuccofs of the Republican
party in November meant peace in the
Philippines, while the success of the op
position meant a prolongation of the
fctrugule, the delegates and spectators
arofe almost as one man and cheered.
The closing words of the Governor
liroupht another demonstration and for a
minute it seemed that the convention
would go mad and then and there make
two nominations instead ofÂ«one. Plumes
â¢went up and standards nerain left their
pockets to be waved on histi- As the Gov

particular toward the radiant face of his
wife, sitting just outside the area of dele

the convention hall Immediately after the adjournment of the convention.
As soon as the committee assembled Senator Hanna was nominated and re

The State of Iowa, owing to tne great
prominence of Representative Dolliver as
a. candidate for the Vice Presidency, had
the honor to nominate Governor Roose

in behalf of the nomination of Roosevelt
had the hearty sympathy of the people,
and greeted all that was said with every
evidence of appreciation. The subject of
these eulogies remained impassive in his
seat, his eyeglasses twinkling and his eyes
flashing nre through them, but It can
hardly be said that he manifested any dis

There was a great shout of delight when
Senator Depew was taking the platform

proceedings of the convention that will
not be forgotten. He had all the tact and

clently extravagant for the j purposes of

journals. Governor Roosevelt has been
sincere. He insisted as long as possible.
He was nominated In a way* that it would
have been Impossible for any eligible citi
zen of the United States to have declined

EHII^ADELPHIA. June a.â The con
vention arose to Join in the prayer
of Archbishop Ryan and pro
ceeded to deal with the unfinished
businoss precisely at 11 a, m. There
were added to the spectacle of the first
and second days the fluttering In the vast
auditorium of ten thousand fans. The
air was advanced in color and brightened
the temper above former experiences.
The spectacle was stirring, splendj^ and
brilliant. Soon came the order ffer the
call of the roll of the States for placing
in nomination a candidate for President
of the United States. The candidate to
be named was an Ohio man. The clerk
to call the roll, was an Ohio man. The
Senator of the Uriitrd States to place the
president of the United States in nomina
tion for re-ejection was an Ohio man.
The clerk, Mr. John Molloy, called Ala
bama and In poetic accord rested there.
A clear voice answered from Alabama
that she "yielded" to Ohio, and Senator
Foraker, was at the front, his first words
being a handsome acknowledgment of
the courtesy of the sister State of the
South. Each sentence of the Senator
strode into the subject and step by step
the story was told of the glory of the ad
ministration of William McKinlcy. There
were thrills and flashes in the phrases of
the speaker who spoke of the struggle of
the President for peace when war was
forced upon the nation and the victories
won under the policy of the President II
peace ar.d In war.
Confidence of Triumph.
There -wsus. Senator Foraker said, "new
glory" and there was the "splendor" of
the power displayed by the country- The
promises of the Republican party made
and kept.; the prosperity that came to the
Â¦ people through the policy of the Presi
dent, and the warmth of personal praise
glowed in each striking Eentence of the
Senator. Intense interest was felt in the
speech and it was replete with the strik
ing characterstics of the Senator. When
he concluded there was a tempest of ap
plause and one must get back to the
halcyon days of the plumed knight to
find Bcenes of excitement eo full of emo
tion and brilliance as that when the
standards of the States were carried to
the platform, where Secretary Hay and
Senator Lodge were 6tandlng, and waved
with the confidence of triumph.
Under the banners Mr. Hanna's head
glowed like porcelain with a crimson tinge
In It, and his countenance spoke hia un
qualified approbation and pleasure. There
was a procession of the 6tandard-bearers
carrying the insignia of the sovereign
States around the spacious quadrilateral
occupied by the delegates and alternates,
and following the Stales the Territories
bringing up the rear was a flag with one
word on it, "Hawaii." The reception given
Hawaii exceeded all the rest. It was the
novelty of the occasion. It was an ad
vertisement cf our acquisitions. It was a
realization of our ambition. It was an
object lesson of what the Republican par
ty <3id that the Democratic party did not;
one of the achievements of the McKlnley
administration, one that another Republi
can administrationâ that of Harrison
would have accomplished If he had net
been Interfered with. It was doubtful for
a time whether the band in the gallery
was doing its duty, but presently, by keen
attention, ft was ascertained that the
brazen instruments were pouring forth the
national airs most zealously.
Wanted to Hear Roosevelt.
Repeatedly there were, after lulls, re
vivals of the shouting frenzy, during the
climaxes of which It seemed that steam
power murt be displayed. The record of
the longest pause. that Interrupted the pro
ceedings of the national convention is
forty-two minutes, and the record might
have been broken if It had not been that
the convention was under the control of a
desire to finish the business in hand, and
more than that, the next speaker was the
Governor of New York, as everybody
knew, and everybody wanted* to hear
Roosevelt, the hero of the day. the man
whose character and achievements, his
characteristics and his peculiarities, per
sonal appearance and individual make-up
had been under analysis, not in Philadel
phia alone but in every city In America,
for about a week. The solicitude to be
hold this formidable personage and hear
his voice E.nd measure what he had to say
was something extraordinary. The pre
siding oficer recognized the gentleman
from New Tork. an9 In the twinkling 1 of
an eye his sturdy figure was seen on the
platform, and first the president of the
convention and secondly the Governor of
New York attempted to still the multitude
which -was raging and roaring like the
eea. Roosevelt extended his hand as If to
still the tempest, but It continued until
curiosity to know what this
man really meant became a commanding
influence, and he was heard. He is not a
professional orator. There Is not the
twang of the golden or silver trumpet in
his utterance. He came upon the platform
with manuscript .in his hand, to which he
referred occasionally, but be never for a
moment wavered from the pursuit of the
theme he had in mind, and there did not
seem to be one word displaced. He had
an easy and masterly authority In his
tones and gestures. There were sentences
like sharp words of command. He was
full of fire and fight, and the blows he
dealt the enemy were rapid, pertinent,
heavy, determined, aggressive, his sen
tences keen and penetrating, his manner
fierce with earnestness. He was as easy
on his feet as a prize-fighter, struck out
with both arms, evidently aimed to give
a left-hand hook on the corner of the jaw
of the lurking enemy he confronted, and
was punishing.
Cheering Became Frantic
The Interest of the convention culmin
ated when he seconded the nomination on
behalf of the State of New York of Wil
liam McKinley. Then the cheering that
had followed the peroration of Foraker
was redoubled, and became frantic. At
this moment the band was wisely guided,
and there cajne swelling from the gallery
the bold, brave notes of the favorite tune,
it is said, of the Governor of New York,
"There Will Be a Hot Time in the Old
Town To-night." The enormous mass of
the populace present recognized the pro
priety of this special music and greeted it
with hosannahs of joy. After this had
been sufficiently rendered there pame the
marching song of "Old John Brown"; then
the "Red, White and Blue," and the patri

was aroused to a grand passion. Even

of the ticket nominated by the Republi

to-day.
"It Is a very good ticket," he replied.
"Roosevelt will make a very good run.

State as a candidate for Vice President.
He certainly makes a better candidate
for Vice President than for Governor."

Laughter ar.d applause were mingled as
the gTeat emblem was borne about. The
demonstration in honor of the President's
nomination lasted five minutes and then
the chairman called for order for the
further event in store.
Mr. Lodg'e warned the noisy and dem
onstrative throngs that there was still
vital business to be done and announced
that the call of States would proceed for
the nomination of Vice President.
Iowa Nominates Roosevelt,
As the name of Alabama was called on
the ro!I of States for the nomination of
Vice President the announcement was
made by the chairman that Alabama
would yield to Iowa to present a candi
date. Chairman Lodge tnen recognized
Colonel Lafe Young-, one of the Iowa del
egates at large and editor of the Des
lloines dowa( Capital.
Colonel Young swung down the main
aisle to the platform to do that Â¦which
a. single orator never before did in a Re
publican National Convention â withdraw
one strong and magnetic man as a candi
date and present the name-cf another for
tlie second office in the gift of the Amer
ican people. / He withdrew the name of
Dollivcr and offered that of Roosevelt.
Gentlemen of the Convention: I have listened

She was as pale as paper, but appeared
smiling and happy. The demonstration
continued for six .minutes and forty sec

friends, looking the while like a bronze
statue, so imperturbable was he.
Seconded by Massachusetts.
The delegates still choked the aisles,
grasping tne Governor's hands and with
difficulty the chairman restored quiet an\
recognized Butler Murray of Massachu
setts for a speech seconding the nomina
tion of Roosevelt. He spoke in behalf of
"Old New England" and his vigorous sen
tences elicited another demonstration for
the Rough Rider candidate. He said:

devotion, unsurpassed by that of any other

manhood and which are a sufficient guaranty

Ashton's Seconding Speech.
After the speech of Mr. Murray of Mas
sachusetts General James M. Ashton of
Washington was recognized and also sec
onded the nomination of Roosevelt. He
said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: We came here from the great, the grow
ing and the -might}- Northwest. We came to
greet my worthy predecessor, the great States
of New England in the mighty Northeast. We
come from the gateway or the treasure land
of Alaska, the land that will make the free
coinage of silver sink into insignificance.
The name of Theodore Koosevelt is known at
everj' fireside throughout the great, the mig
nificent mountains and across the broad plains
of the Northwest. Everywhere It Is the symbol
of American heroism and American manhood.
When we came here we had in our minds for
this exalted poeitlon anr eminent Jurist, an emi
nent diplomat, the Hon. Dart Us t Tripp of the
great Northwest. (Applause.) We have said
from the commencement. If it were possible
to secure the nomination and the acceptance of
Governor Roosevelt, toeether with the grand
character of American history, the eminent il
lustrious and patriotic stateman and . sololer,
William McKInley (applause), it would be the
greatest ticket, the grandest ticket and the
strongest which can be placed before the Amer
ican people. Now, gentlemen of the conven
tion, beneath the banner of McKInley and
Roosevelt, the West will unite with the mighty
East and go before* the ehrlne of the people.
We have no fears. You will find that when
the ballot Is case next November, the West
fca$, with the entire country, woven about the
girdle of Columbia the guerdon of political
power and political freedom; you will find that
when you count the ballots from the States
of the setting sun. they will read for McKIn
ley and for Roosevelt, and we will clasp that
girdle in Republican victory.
Depew Grows Humorous.
"Depew, Depew." demanded the dele
gates in tumultuous chorus, and as they
called the well known face and figure of
the Xew York Senator emerged from his
delegation. Governor Roosevelt himself
taking him by the arm and urging him
forward to the platform.
The benign face of the postprandial or
ator looked down and with his musical
voice he began a magnificent and im
promptu tribute to the hero of the hour.
He was in good humor as well as good
voice, and his touch of jocosity in refer
ring to "Teddy" and the "get there" qual
ities of Youn? America brought out a
storm of mingled laughter and applause.
He pictured "Teddy' r as the child of
Fifth avenue, the cultured product of
Harvard, the cowboy of the plains, the
vitalizing force in marshaling the Amer
ican ships to overwhelm the Spaniards
the impetuous leader at Santiago and San
Juan and Â¦ the idolized Governor of the
Empire State. He pictured, too. the
"dude" becoming a "cowboy," the "cow
boy" becoming a soldier, the soldier be
coming a hero and the hero, blade In
hand, in the press of battle, shouting.
"Give 'em hell, boys." Ills speech fol

IN THE CONVENTION HALL
protection of American industries; and MeKin
ley, after four years" development. In peace, in
war, in prosperity and In adversity, the great
est President, save cne or two. that this coun
try ever had, and the greatest ruler in Chris
tendom to-day. (Applause.)
From "Dude" to Governor.
So with. Colonel Rooseveltâ we call him
"Teddy ' (Applause.) lie was the child ot
New York, of New York City, the place that
you gentlemen from the West think means cou
j.ons, clubs and eternal damnation for every
one. "Teddy," this child of Fifth avenueâ he
was the chfld of the clubs; he was the child of
the cxcluslveness of Harvard College, and he
went and became a cowboy (applause and
laughter) and then he went into the Navy l>e
partment and became an assistant secretary-
He gave an ord?i and the old chiefs of bureaus
cair.e to him and said:
"Why. colonel, there Is no authority and no
requisition to burn this powder."
"Well," %M the colonel, "we have got to
get ready \wien war comes and powder was
manufactured to bo burned." (Applause.)
Anil the burning of that powder eunk Cerve
ra's fleet outside of Santiago's harbor and the
fleet in Manila Hay. (Applause.)
At Santiago a modest voice was heard, ex
ceedingly polite, addressing a militia regiment
lying upon the ground while the Spanish bullets
were flying over them. This voice said:
"Get Jo one side, gentlemen, please; one side,
gentlemen, please, that my men can get out.":
And when this polite man got his men out In
the open where they could face the bayonnt
and face the ballet there was a transformation,
and' the transformation was that the dude had
become e. cowboy, the cowboy had beco;ne a
soldier, the soldier had become a -hero, and
rushing the hill, pistol in hand (great ap
plause), the polite man shouted to the militia
men lying down: â¢ - -
"Give them hell, boys'. Give them hell!" '
Allusion has been made by one of the speak
ers to the fact that the Democratic convention
is to me?t on the Fourth of July. Great Scott,
the Fourth of July: (Laughter.) On the Fourth
of July all the great heroes of the ' revolution,
all the great heroes of the war of IS 12, all the
erect heroes ot the war with Mexico and the
heroes of* the wai" with Spain.-- who are n<H
dead, will tx? in procession all over, the country.
thcÂ«Â» mighty spirts, but they will not be "at the
Democratic convention at Kansas. City.
<A voice from the platform. "And the- war of
the rebellion.") . ...
And the war of the rebellion â there; is one
gentleman who is detained from there and the
welcome which they would delight to. give
him. but he Is at present engaged in running
a' footrace under the blazing sun from the'sol
diers of the United States. (Laughter and ap
plause.) . ;
George Washington's spirit will not ha there,
but George Washington Aguinaldo, If he could,
would be there as a welcome delegate. (Laugh
ter and applause.) I would like- to sit in the
gallery and hear the platform read, condemning
expansion, with Jefferson coming out of the
clouds and sayln;:
"Who are you? Didn't my expansion . bring
In fifteen States a .a glorious and as great as any
In your convention and what are you condemn
ing me for? Anti-Imperialism? Because we
are putting down an insurrection in the Phil
ippines?" ' . Â¦ _ ;â¢
And from the grave at the. Hermitage comes
the spirit of old Andrew Jackson, saying:
"Get cut of here, or by the eternal I will let
you know who I am." (Laughter and ap
plause.>
Raps the Ice Trust.
A.ntl-aequlsitibn of territory! And then comes
a Drocessirn of Democrats of the old Demo
cratic party. Jefferson, Monroe, Polk, Pierce,
pointing to Louisiana, pointing to New Mex
ico, pointirg to California, pointing to Oregon,
pointing to what has made our country flrst
and foremost among the countries of the world.
(Applause and cheers.) And then will coma
the great card of the convention, headed by
the great Bryan 'himself. "Down with the
trusts; dovrn with the trusts." And when the
applause Is over it will be found that the
pitchers on the table have been broken by the
clashing of the ice within. (Prolonged laughter
and applause.) For that ice will be making
merry at five cents a chunk.
I heard a story (laughter); this Is a brand
new story â < renewed laughter). It is of the
vintage of June, 1900. Most of my stories are
more venerable. There was a lady with her
Husband in Florida last winter. He a con
sumptive and she a strenuous and tumultuous
woman. (Laughter.) Her one remark was as
they sat on the piazza, "Stop coughing, John."
John had a hemorrhage. The doctor said he
must stay In bed six weeks. His tumultuous
wife said:
"Doctor, it Is impossible; we are traveling on
a time-limited ticket, and we have got several
more places to go to." (Laughter and ap
plause.) ;
So she carried him off. The next station they
pot to the poor man died and the sympathetic
hotel rrorrietcr said:
Poor madam, what shall we do?"
She cald. "Box him up; I have got a time
limited ticket and several more places to go
to." (Laughter and applause.) - ?
Now. we buried 1Â« to 1 In 1S36. "We put a
monument over it weighing as may tons as the
Sierra Nevadas when gold was put into the
statutes by a Republican Congress and the sig
nature of William McKInley. Colonel Bryan
has been a body-snatcher. (Laughter.) He has
get. the corpse out from under the monument.
Imt It is dead. He has got it in its* coffin,
carrying It along as did the bereaved widow
because he says:
"I must! I must! I am. wedded to this body
of s!n and death." (Laughter.) â¢ I 'must' I
must! Because I have a time ticket which ex
pires in November." (Laughter and applause.)
I remember when I used to go abroad â it Is
a good thing for any Yankee to go abroadâ I
used to be ashamed because everywhere they
would say: r
"What Is the matter with the declaration of
Independence when ycu have slavery Â¦ In your
land?" , ' "Â¦'Â¦.- <-.i
Well, we took slavery out. and now no Amer
ican is ashamed to go abroad. When I went
abroad afterward the ship was full of mer
chants, buying iron and buying steel and buy-
Ing wool and buying cotton and all kinds of
goods. Now when an American goes abroad or
around the world what happens to him when
he reaches the capital of Japan? "He, rides an
an electric railway mode by American, mechan
ics. When he goes over the great vast of Si
beria, from China to St. . Petersburg, he rides
In American cars, j drawn by . American I loco
motives. When he goes to Germany he finds
our Iron and Eteel climbing over a 12 50 tariff
and thereby soaring the Kaiser almost out of
his wits. Â¦ = (Laughter.) When he : reaches the
great exposition at. Parts he finds the French
wlnemaker saying that American wine cannot
be admitted there for the purposes of judgment.
When he goes to old London he gets for break
fast California fruit: he gets for lunch biscuit
and bread made of Western flour, and he gets
for dinner ""roast beef of old England" . taken
from the plains of. Montana (laughter); his feet
rest on a carpet marked "Alxminster" made at
Tonkers, N. Y." : (Renewed laughter.) *
Growth. of American Trade.
. Now, my friends. 'this cam-ass we are enter-
Ing upon is a canvass 'of -the future; the past
is only for record and for referepee, and, thank
God. we have a reference and a record. What
Is the tendency of the future? Why thl* war
in South Africa? Why this t.nmmerins at the
gates at Peking? Why this marching of troops
from? Asia to Africa? Why. these parades of
people from other empires and other lands?
It Isbecaijse the . surplus productions Â¦ of the
civilized countries of modern. times are greater
than civilization can consume. It is because
this ; overproduction goes * back to . stagnation
and to poverty. .',â¢: V' â¢Â¦ '- ;
. iThe American people 'now produce two: thou
sand' millions of dollars' worth more than we
can conrame,' and we havie met the emergency;
and, by the providence of.God.\by the etates-
manshlp of William McKInley and by the
valor of Roosevelt and his associates (applause)
we have our market in Hawaii, we have our
market In the Philippines and we stand In the
presence of 800,000, W0 people,- with -the Pacific
as an American lake and the artisans producing
better goods than any country In the world.
My friends, we eo to the American laborer
and to -the American farmer and they say that
with McKInley for another four years there Is
no congestion for America. Let Invention pro
ceed; let production go on; let the mountains
bring forth their treasure; let the factories do
their best; let labor be employed at the highest
wages, because the world Is ours and we have
conquered It by Republican principles and by
Republican persistency in the principles of
American Industry and of America for Ameri
cans. (Applause.) You and I, my friends, you
from New England, with all Its culture and
coldness (laughter), and you from the middle
West, who, starting from Ohio and radiating
In every direction.- think you are, all there is
of it (laughter); you from the West, who pro
duced on this platform a product of New Eng
land transformed to the West through Xew
York, that delivered the best presiding officer's
speech in oratory and all that makes up a great
speech that has been heard in many a day In
any convention in this country (applause and
cries of "Good, good"'); it was a glorious thing
to see the fervor of the West and the culture
and polish of New England giving us an am
munition wagon from .which the spellbinder
everywhere can draw the powder to shoot down
opposition east and west and . north and south.
Many of you I met In convention four years
ago. We all f##l what little men we were then
compared with what wÂ« are to-day. There Is
not a man here to-day that does not feel 400
per cent bigger 1900 than he did in 1S?6, big
ger, intellectually, -bigger hopefully.- bigger pa
triotically, bigger in the fact that he is a citi
zen of a country that has become a world
power for peace, for civilization and for the
expansion of Its Industries and the products
of Its labor. . . '
We hare the best ticket ever presented. (Ap
plause.) We have at the head of it a Western
man with Eastern notions, and we have at the
other end of It an Eastern man with Western
characteristics (loud applause): a statesman
and a cowboy (laughter): the accomplished man
of affairs and the heroic fighter. .The man who
has proved great "as President and the fighter
who has proved great as Governor. (Applause.)
We leave thi*-. old -'town simplr' to keep on
shouting and working to make it . unanimous
for McKInley. and. for Roosevelt.
Roosevelt ' Does Not Vote.
i "Roosevelt!" ' "Teddy!" "Roosevelt!"
came. from- all quarters of the hall. The
Governor sat unmoved, fanning himself
desperately; and shaking his head nega
tively at the calls for his appearance.
. The- impatient audience called for a
vote, It appearing that there would be no
other -candidates. It took some minutes
to restore order. Chairman Lodge vigor
ously pounding his desk and appealing to
the assemblage. Just as Alabama, the
first. State .on. the rollcall, was called ex-
Senator Quay started cut of the hall and
there was a disturbance of cheers. Par
tial order was restored and the rollcall
â¢was , proceeded with, each delegation as
named casting its vote for Roosevelt.
Â¦During the rollcall deltgates and specta
tors, realizing that the convention would
be unanimous, chatted and laughed until
the results of the noise was like the roar
of a sullen sea on a rocky coast.
At the' conclusion of the call Chairman
Lodge announced that Roosevelt had re
ceived 929 votes, one delegate in the con
vention .not voting. This delegate was
Governor -Roosevelt himself, who re
frained from voting with the New York
delegation.
Chairman- Lodge's announcement that
Roosevelt^ had been nominated for Vice
President evoked a burst of applause that
fairly shook the great steel girders of the
building ,tp- its foundations. Governor
Roosevelt,' now the candidate for Vice
President, was surrounded, by delegates
showering congratulations lipon-him. He
stood In the middle aisle, the stern look
of recent days having given away to an
expansive smile.
The serious work of the convention was
now practically over and only a few de
tails remained to be perfected.' A resolu
tion by Grosvenor was agreed to for an
official print of the convention proceed
ings and a. reprint of the proceedings of
four years ago. Another ; resolution em
powered the National Committee to till
vacancies oh the. committee.
On motion of Senator Scott of WeÂ«t
Virginia, George "VVIswell of Milwaukee
was . unanimously elected sergeant at
arms of the National Committee for four
years In place of H. L. Swords of New
York, resigned.
On motion of Colonel Dick Senator
Lodge was placed at the head of the com
mittee to notify the President of his nom
ination and Senator Wolcott at the head
of . the committee to notify the Vice Pres
idential, nominee.. Votes of thanks to air
Lodge and Mr. Wolcott for their able ser
vices, as presiding officers were unani
mously adopted;- also thanks to Mayor
Ashbrldge of Philadelphia for, the hospi
tality of the city and to all officials of the
convention. Â» Â¦ .
This closed the work and at 2:14, on mo
tion of Mr. Payne of New -York the Re
publican convention- of 1900 adjourned
sine die.

PALL HEADQUARTERS TCEL-
LIN'GTON HOTEL. "WASHING-
LTON, June 2Lâ"It was a very nice
convention and I am naturally very
much gratified at the result of Its
work," was the comment of Presi-
dent McKlnley this afternoon. â¢
Mr. MeKinley looked the picture of per-
feet health and said he was never better
in fcis life. His face had fresh color, his
eyes were bright and the grasp of his
hand was firm.
The President received the news of his
renomination through bulletins, bv which
fce was kept advised of the convention
proee-idings. He smiled approvingly as
he g.anced hastily over the bulletin an-
nouncing the result, and after receiving
the congratulations of those present he
took the bulletin to Mrs. MeKinley. "
While the President was sitting with
Mrs. MeKinley news of Governor Roose-
velfs nomination was handed to him: Pri-
vate Secretary Cortelyou was summoned,
and in a few minutes an appropriate tele-
gram of congratulation was sent from the
White House to the nominee for Vice
President. -V >
One of the amusing incidents of the day
was the fact that the first telegram of '
congratulation to the President came from
the American Consul at Port-au-Prince,
Hayti- It is supposed he must have sent
it ahead of time, with Instructions to have
the message delivered as soon as the
nomination was announced.
Within a few minutes telegrams frcm
.all parts of the country and many from
abroad commenced to pour in. and the en-
tire day and night force of the executive
office was rushed to handle them. It is
said by those of long experience that no
occupant of the White House ever.re-
ceived so many telegrams In one day.
Assistant Secretary of ttie*Navy Hack-
ett was the first departmental caller to
extend his personal congratulations. He
was followed by Secretaries Root and
Hitehc'ock. Major General Corbln and sev-
eral bureau chiefs from the Treasury De-
partment.
Senator Platt of Connecticut was the
first Senatorial visitor. He gave way to
Representative Ketcham of New York,
the first member of the House to appear.
Senator Cullom. Representative Graff of
Illinois and Senator Kyle of South Dakota
were later callers.
By 5 o'clock .the President was weary
reading telegrams of congratulation and
"went for? a drive with Secretary Cortel
vou- As he rode through the principal
streets he was greeted by citizens and
acknowledged their greetings by lifting
nIs nat and rtBQt and left. i
President MeKinley received the Mar
<J"ette Club of Chicago this morning. He
g *vÂ£, a Mml^m r, tO tÂ« g h tO SÂ°m%
of his fiends from Canton, homeward
followed by a general reception to rn'm
bers of the Homeopathic Association, now
in session in this city.

Never Before Has an Occupant of the Executive Mansion at
Washington Received so Many Telegrams in a Single Day.
Greetings From the American Consul at Port au Prince
Flood of Congratulations Pours In Upon Presi

HERE IS THE LIST OF GRADUATES
The reclamation, where possible, of the arid lands
of the country is promised, and as this carries with
it of necessity the conservation of moisture by preser
vation of the forage on the stock ranges, it includes
such. policy as will arrest the extermination of the
natural grasses and forage plants in all the arid coun
try west of the ninety-ninth meridian. This is a far
reaching policy, which will preserve and increase the
beef and mutton food Â¦ supply to keep pace with the
demand, and at the same time will provide^arable land
by irrigation to receive our^increasing population and
furnish them homes. "' . â¢
The isthmian canal is favored, and a new Cabinet
Department of Commerce ?.nd Industries is called for,
to take charge of our consular system and have the
general care and oversight of our vast trade and in
dustrial operations. (
The platform is; remarkable for the space given to
business and the little attention bestowed upon what
may be called mere party politics. The covenants
Our deep water commerce is promised support, to
the end that our own cargoes may be carried under
our own flag. â¢
Upon the labor question advance ground is taken.
Better educational facilities for working children are
demanded, the age limit for child labor is to be
raised, and an effective system. of labor insurance is
put among the things that concern the party.
This part of the platform shows the keenest politi
cal insight into affairs. It states the status quo. and
in effect says to the people, "When you want to
change it, change it."
Turning to the declaratory part of the platform; it.
is beyond criticism. The approval of the gold stan
dard and the onlook toward further, legislation
which will extend its. benefits in low .interest and
economical use of credit to all parts of the country \
will convince the sound money men that the party in
tends no backward step. .Wisely the platform is ad
dressed to domestic policies and affairs, and as to. our
external vexations is very conservative and tentative.
There is no~radical declaration .about the Philippines)
and the men of conscience who oppose expansion for
principle's sake will find nothing that stands in the
way. of a reaction, if that be the destiny of this issue.
The position of The Call is well known, and we are
glad that the platform practically conforms to. it.
Those who were urging;, a specific declaration of Â»
Filipino fellow-citizenship in the California . State
platform will Â«ee now that such a policy would have .
been like the free silver declaration of 1896, and
would have put the party in the State at variance with
the party in the nation.
The platform itself has gradually enlarged until it
is a formidable document, and a complete review of
the work -done by the part)', if in power, and by way
of background to its declaratory clauses is considered
incomplete without a broadside of damnatory stuff
aimed at the enemy. The current Republican plat
form adopted at Philadelphia is of unusual excellence.
Its damnatory clauses jnay raise a question of taste,
but as custom requires them they may be passed as the
usual "defi" of the other party. It may be said, how
ever, that as they "hark back to Mr. Cleveland's last
administration and attack it, they will not havethe
field to themselves, for the Bryan Democracy brooks
no rival in the business of denouncing Mr. Cleve
land and all his works. Perhaps this will enable a
more just final judgment upon that administration
than would be possible if it were balanced be
tween scowls of disapprobation on one side and
shouts of approval on the other. . . Â¦ { .
THE PLATFORM.
IN the early history of party conventions the plat
form consisted merely of a few declaratory resolu
tions, setting forth the leading policies of the
party, to which its candidates were committed.
LINCOLN; Nebr., June 21.â According to the books just turned in by the City Assessors, the past year has been a
prosperous one for Mr. Bryan, and he is now in the matter of personal property easily the richest man in Lincoln-
Last year Mr. Bryan returned as his possessions money in bank amounting to $2o00, and other personalty bringing: the to
tal up to $2890. This year the total returned Is $4560. which includes 53900 In bank and other crsdlta. In Is,ebraaia each
man is simply given a printed schedule and asked to fill it out and swear to the truthfulness thereof, making it simply
a matter of conscience with him. Ex-Lieutenant Governor Moore, who has heretofore paid the largest amount of per
sonal taxes in the city, ranks second, with $3615 as his valuation. . Â« ,'fV
BUBONIC quarantines no longer plague San
Francisco, nor is there any danger of their im-.
mediate recurrence. The Board of Health has
for a time at least ceased to trouble; and Kinypun,
whose authority to institute the quarantine has been
revoked by the President, has yet to answer to Judge
Morrow for contempt of court. The situation is
clear of all irritations, and now is the time for the
intelligence of the city to profit by the lesson ex
perience has taught. - â¢ -â¢ v ;
The, one thing which gave the Board /of. Health
and-Kinyoun even a shadow of excuse ipr taking the
course"they ; did, which led the people in other ciiies
.to lend a- credulous ear to rtirn'orsT of.- -bubonic plague
in San Francisco, is the ' indisputable â¢ foulness - r of
Chinatown.. It is known' that the sanitary "regula-;
tions enforced, im other parts of the city are' neglected
in the Chinese .quarter, that the buildings there are
ill ventilated, ill 'provided with plumbing and sewer
connections, . ill fitted with fire escapes, and are un
healthy, foul-smelling and filthy. It is known, more
over, that they are overcrowded and are undermined
with dismal tunnels and passage-ways reeking with
dirt and inhabited by people. who swarm'like rats in
their burrows anti have no regard for sanitation or,
cleanliness. It was*that knowledge that caused the
fear of plague in whatever quarters such fear existed,
and so long as Chinatown continues in its present
condition so long will we be in danger of having a
quarantine established against us.- Â¦ /
The one lesson, then, which we can profitably learn
from the bubonic' scare is that of the importance of
enforcing the" sanitary regulations of the city and
compelling property-owners in" Chinatown t/ clean
the buildings and put them >in proper . condition.
There should be no delay in that reform. Some of
the;.wealthiest men in San Francisco are among the
landlords of Chinatown and. can well afford the cost
of 'cleaning jup their property. - It is a monstrous
abuse of power to compel; even the poorest property-;
owners in other localities to obey the- health laws
while .these rich landlords are .permitted to ignore
them, 1 defy them and mock at them.
The imperative need of a strict enforcement of sani
tary regulations in 'Chinatown is another reason why
the Mayor should remove the present members of the
Board, of Health and replace them with men who will
be energetic and impartial in enforcing the law. Had
the Board of, Health been in earnest, the property
owners of Chinatown would have been compelled to
clean .their premises as soonas there was the first
su?picion'of plague in the quarter. The board, how
ever, has done nothing to redeem the district from its
unhealthy condition, nor can it be relied upon to do
anything. There is needed in Chinatown a: new era
of municipal supervision,- a thorough enforcement of
all the sanitary ordinances of the city, and a new
Board of Health to sec that they are enforced." That
is the lesson of the day, and it should be learned and
acted upon before the disastrous "experience which
taught it has been forgotten..

When the conditions attendant upon a great po
litical convention, the confusion of vast crowds, the
incessant flow of rumors of all kinds; and the -hurry
and strain under which the work "has to be done are
taken into consideration, it will be perceived that the
achievement of The Call in giving such correct and
interesting reports of every phase of the proceedings
is a notable triumph of journalism. It will be taken
by the public as another proof that The Call gives the
news^jsiore comprehensively -recorded, morey accu
rately presented, and freer from fakes or padding
than any other paper on the Pacific 'Coast.
What has been done in reporting the Republican
convention wiil : be repeated in reporting the Demo
cratic convention at Kansas City. -There again The
Call will have not a'showy coterie of space writers,
but a trained staff of newsgatherers, men who will un
dertake to get the facts as early as possible and tell
them in the fewest possible words. The proceedings
of the Democrats will be reported with, the same fair
ness and fullness" that have characterized the reports
from Philadelphia.
The telegraphic dispatches have averaged upward
of 100,000 words a day, and every word, was a part
of a legitimate news report. No' space was given to
padding, to fakes, or to any device, for making a
false showing. The Call published newsâ reliable,
accurate news. There was no duplication of this fact
or that rumor; no spreading buy of gossip and tat
tle; each dispatch was part of a harmonious whole
and tended to make clear to the rea-der every step of
the proceedings, th^ plans. of the leaders, the strug
gles-for the Vice Presidency, the great speeches- of
the occasion, and. in fact/'everything of the conven
tion that could"be included in the broad scope of 'its'
history. Â¦ ':
WITH the satisfaction which results from the ac
complishment of ;good work under" difficult
conditions,. The -Call invites attention to" : the
excellence; of the reports given of the ' Republican
National Convention at Philadelphia. These reports
have been thoroughly comprehensive in their scope.
They have covered i,e'viry,. interesting detail of the
proceedings, arid have in. many instances forecasted
what the convention would do: A notable instance
was the announcement on the first day of. the conven
tion that Roosevelt would be the nominee for Vice
President, and that the -nomination would be the. re
sult of a well nigh'uni versa! demand. H-'

run to sound money, lower interest, ; a more .. elastic
currency system,; access of all \ business men to " the
loan fund; the increase of' our foreign trade, doing
our own ocean carrying, protecting out labor against
servile competition, so that all "men interested in the
materialities of the country will" find in it a reflection
of their thoughts and a promise to consider their in
terests. .. . ... Â¦ V
That was the Bryanite forecast and prediction, and
upon it it is safe to say they are gone. What ticket
can hope to carry New| York against McKinley and
Roosevelt?
That the ticket, is a winning one is hardly to be
disputed even by the most sanguine Bryartite. In
fact Bryan's organ, the New York Journal, some
time ago in making estimates of the coming election
stated: "Let the Democrats carry New York and
they will pick up electoral votes enougH elsewhere in
the East to make them safe f> no matter how many
they lose in the Far West. Let them lose Ne\^ York,
and, as the Oregon election shows, they are gone."
Roosevelt has filled a large space in public life, and*
to the younger generation of Americans has become
something of an. ideal figure. Born to wealth and
educated in the centers of our highest culture, .heÂ£
turned in early manhood to the Great (West, ami
there on the plains among the cowboys learned to
know and to understand that genuine manhood is not j
dependent upon either. wealth or culture; that itjls j
to be found among American freemen everywhere;!
and speaks as truly in the forcible dialect of the West j
as in the polished language of the universities. So j
he grew to be a broad-minded, strong, resolute, true)
American; and when the war came he by a natural
impulse became the leader of that famous regiment
whose members were drawn from Fifth avenue and
from the Texas plains, and which represented in its
ranks every class of patriotic and valiant American,
from the dude to the cowboy. From the glory of war
he returned to enter upon the high duties of Govejrnor
of the greatest State in the Union, and there so amply
fulfilled all the brightest expectations of the public,
that within a short time he was noted as a. man of
Presidential size, and the choice of the whole country j
for the Vice Presidency. â¢
The administration of President McKinley has been
marked by so much of prosperity attained by industry
and so much of glory achieved in war that if the
record were written merely in the statistics of trade
and in the simplest facts that narrate the war with
Spain it would be eloquent. From four years of de
pressed trade, stagnant industry, disordered finance,
and of disaster so widespread that almost every work
jngman's home was threatened with destitution, the
country under the administration of McKinley passed
directly to a period of the highest and most universal
prosperity ever known by any people' at any age in
the history of the world. In bringing about that
happy change the peisonal influence of the President
has counted for much. It is to him more than to .any
other single man that we owe it, and popular grati
tude as well as a regard for self-interest rendered it a
foregone conclusion that he would be renominated
and will be re-elected.
\A cKINLEY and Roosevelt. That is the
/â¢ \ ticket the Republican party presents to the
* * country. - It is not too much to say it has
been presented in response to the demand of a vast
majority of the voters. The convention has done no
more than register the popular will. Of the renomi
nation of McKinley there has not been any doubt at
any time since he entered upon his high office, and
the nomination of Roosevelt for the Vice Presidency
was assured as soon as the delegates of the conven
tion brought to one another reports of whai their
constituents wished in that respect.
McKINLEY AND ROOSEVELT.

When the Contra Costa Water Company destroyed

The people of Oakland have proved more than once

If people are judged by the company they keep the
police officer who was chatting with two murderous

Californians have been without rivals in their hos

And an underling of the National Government did
everything in his unauthorized power to make Cali

aistrict of California this year, and if proper care be
trken none will occur. In the Fifth District, how
ever, there is danger that many an independent voter
wiil be dissati?fied with the way things have been
managed by .Watt and bis committee, and against
that the State Committee must guard.
The issue is an important one and would be so re
parded under any circumstances, but is the more so
a* this juncture, because all political experts agree
that to the Republican party in this campaign the one
point of danger is that of losing control of the
House of Representatives. We cannot afford to take
risks in Congressional districts, and to cause any dis
content in the Fifth would be taking risks.
In brief: Watt, claiming an authority which is not
of record, named a committee, which in turn last May
named the district delegates to a convention, and
those delegates in . convention renominated Watt's
committee for a new lease of power. It is a case of
wheels within wheels, and each wheel working with
an electric force" of a watt at 'every turn.
The situation is this: James Alva Watt claims that
he" was authorized' by the Republican nominating
convention of the Fifth Congressional District in
1898 to appoint a Congressional district committee.
There is no record, official or otherwise, of the grant
of any such authority, nor does ft. appear that Watt
undertook to act- upon it until fourteen' months after
the convention. adjourned. -However, the committee
was appointed and proceeded to act. When arrange
ments for the recent Republican State Convention to
elect delegates to the national convention were under
consideration Mr/ Wait assured the State Central
Committee that primnry elections would be held in
the district for the purpose of electing delegates to
the State convention. The promise was broken. The
delegates from the district to the convention were ap
pointed by Watt's committee. That was bad enough,
but now there has been filed a resolution adopted by
the Fifth District convention last May continuing the
same committee in office. â¢ -
I T PON the Republican State Central Committee
I I rests a serious responsibility in connection with
' the affairs of the party in the Fifth Congres
sional District. The situation there is by no means
promising, and as the district abounds with voters of
independent minds there is danger that many of them
may be led to oppose the party nominees because of
a dislike of the means by which certain men have
tcught to obtain and to hold party control in the dis
trict. Â¦ ' ' . ":, - v

: and privileged to talk ; to \ them; = to Â¦ share
with them - the congratulation ,-. which
Americans feel at the nomination of Wil
liam McKinley for President of the United
States and -Theodore* Roosevelt for Vice
President. It was fitting, he said, that
the - representative men Â»f California
should assemble to ratify these nomina
tions. "The convention at Philadelphia,"
he said, " has done: its duty well. It has
rewarded a statesman with I the highest
honor in its gift. It-has made "William
McKinley again Â¦ Its standard-bearer.: . It
has. made one of the greatest of Amer
icans, Theodore Roosevelt, his running
mate. I cannot justly characteri2e the
man for whom the , Republican party asks
your â¢ votes for President. '
5 {'He has proved his , statesmanship. ... He
has demonstrated his ability to. meet the
severest i tests of government. Under his
guidance 'wo .have -passed' through &ne'ot
the most Â¦ critical : periods of our history.
Under his guiding hand* we have emerged,
from a * crisis . that was ' serious enough Â¦ to
make the most confident quail. .-Â¦ In small

displayed the same marvelous faculty of
administration: - \
" "WHen by unjust and outrageous quar
antine we * were .- threatened with irrepar
able "harm ' he came ; to .: our assistance.
When the State was placed under the ban,
when it 'was heralded to the world â. as a
place 'unclean, President McKinley raised
edge what the United States has won un
der the administration of President Mc-
Kinley. ' "
. "Four years have rolled around," he
said, "since in this very . Pavilion the Re
publicans of this city met and ratified
the nomination of William McKinley. The
Democrats were then in power in Wash
ington. They. were at the helm of state
and they missed nothing that might lead
on to disaster. To-night we speak of a
prosperous time, of a happy people, of
men at peace with their neighbors: We
are in the midst of business revival.
Wages are being - paid, the mechanic Is
employed, there Is plenty everywhere and
we owe it to the administration of Wil
liam McKinley. ,
"Four years ago the country was in
sorest distress. There was financial de
pression. Capital and labor were at war.
The mills were closed. Starvation stalked
in the cities and on the byways. Relief
committees were organized, soup houses
were established and the : people of â¢ the
Union knew what suffering follows in the
wake of national maladministration. Then
came the triumph of the Republican party
and the restoration of normal, healthy na
tional life. It is such a life that we are
now enjoying and > we must preserve It.
Our only, hope is the election of William
McKinley and â¢ Theodore Roosevelt."
' Azain the great Pavilion was stormy

of "William McKinley.
"We are at the dawn of a magnificent
era.' Our flag Is respected the seas over.
We are In the van of civilization and
there we must remain. " "We have won our
splendid place through the administration
of William McKinley. As Americans,
cherishing our country, believing In Its
future, pledged to its prosperity, we must
support Â¦ the man who has led us on tÂ«
the triumph of our nationality. Let us
in this splendid campaign cease to bo
Democrats . or Republicans; let us know
no East or West, no North or South: let
us have no sectionalism, no antagonisms,
but" nnlty â¢ in Â¦ the common brotherhood of
Americans. Â¦ Let us be glad of the privi
lege that we have to-nrght, the privilege
of pledging to the greatest of Americana
our fealty and our . votes. He deserves
this from us and we. would be false to oux
duty if we failed him."
Time after Â¦ time the speaker was ap
plauded, and when he had concluded H.
C. Dibble was introduced. He'follow'ea
in similar strain.' He 1 outlined the stir
ring events which have made history dur
ing the administration of President Mo
Kinley, and he counseled all to do what
they can to make that administration perÂ»
manent. ' E. M. Wolf and T. V. Eddy werÂ»

adjourned with , three cheers for i the na
tional Republican ticket.
SAN FRANCISCO TAKES A NIGHT OFF TO SHOUT FOR THE NOMINEES.
THE Republicans of San ' Francisco
turned out In force last night to
ratify the nomination of their na
tional standard bearers. Shouting,
entering, hurrahing thousands thronged
Mechanics' Pavilion. By courtesy they
listened long enough to the speakers to
obtain an excuse for more cheers for Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt. Flags were wav
ing In the air; men and women were sing
ing national songs at the top of their
voices; uniformed clubs were marching
around the great structure to the encour
ceing storm of hurrahs, and for a few
hours at least Republican San Francisco
had a night off and free swing to use its
Jungs.
There was not the slightest doubt that
the speakers were eloquent and that their
discussion of national issues was thought
ful and thorough, but the thousands of
men and women who . had thronged
through the doors and made a sea of
eager, expectant and exulting faces want
ed noise. They wanted to cheer for Mc-
Kinley and then for Roosevelt. They
wanted to cheer for anything and every
thing Republican.
They shouted themselves hoarse over
tha Btories of the Spanish war. They had
but to hear the name of an American sol
dier to shout again. It was a scene of In
terest and excitement. It was San Fran
cisco's way of congratulating itself on the
nomination of William McKinley for Pres
ident of the United States.

with applause and when silence was re
stored Merton C. Allen was Introduced,
ostensibly to read some of the significant
sentences of the Republican national plat
form. He did more, prefacing his reading
with an eloquent, thoughtful discussion
of national Issues. He received a well
merited tribute of applause and gave way
to Samuel M. Shortridge.
Shortridge Talks Briefly.
Mr. Bhortridge's address was brief, but
be touched upon phases of national ques
tions which excited the audience to what
was perhaps the highest pitch of enthu
siasm during the evening. He pictured
the triumph of- American arms, the prog
ress and splendid development of Ameri
can nationality and the hope of a position
of unrivaled supremacy among the na
tions. Only through the Republican party,
he said, can that hope be realized. When
he â¢ had ceased there were repeated and
insistent demands for him to continue.
He was followed by George C. Ross of San
Mateo, who spoke for the young men of
the party. His discussion of national af
fairs was on the lines of his predecessors
on the platform.
Frank McOowan then held tho audience
in absorbed attention in a brief address.
"If it were a felony to deliver a speech."
he said. "I never would be convicted. But
it seems to me the' easiest thing in tha
world to tell why we are in duty
bound to Tote for William McKinley for
President and Theodore Roosevelt for
Vice President. We owe to William Mc-
Kinley tha dignity of our nation. He has
guided us through the terrors of war. Ha
has lifted us to a position of honor among*
the nations. Under his administration
prosperity has come to us. Our merchants
and mechanics, our farmers and miners,
the people of the cities and the country.
Campaign Opens for Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt Un
der Flattering Conditions.
The name of the Congressman was re
ceived with cheers. He spoke briefly but
eloquently on the issues of the campaign.
He told what he knows of the administra
tion, describing, with a thorough knowl-
Cheers for Congressman Kahn.
"We have had many able representa
tives In the House of Representatives, but
we have never had In our history men
more able than those who now represent
us. Among them is one whom I wish to
introduce to youâ Julius Kahn."
As he closed the Bear Club and its drill
corps entered the Pavilion and added to
the enthusiasm. Â¦"
"And it is hardly necessary for me to
say that Theodore Roosevelt will be the
next Vice President of the United States.
"We all know his history. We know his
eelf-sacriflce, his bravery, his gallantry
and his statesmanship. Â»\Ve know what he.
has done in the service of his country
and we can accept that as a pledge of
what he will do. Under the banner of
these men we will march to victory. I
am glad therefore that to-night we have
gathered to do honor to these men, to
pledge them our suffrages and to hope
that for them success will be won.
"As we owe this to the great statesman
who now asks us to return him to the
post which he has so sigpnally honored
and dignified other States, are in similar
manner Indebted to him. If there be grat
itude in the American people, if our prog
ress is to be assured, if an administra
tion eminently sound is to be indorsed,

7THE BOMBARDMENT OF TIENTSIN HAS BEGUN
Grave Fears Ex
ist in London
as to the Safety
of Europeans
in Peking.
WASHINGTON, June 2Lâ Acting
Secretary of ihe Navy Hackett
received a cable message this
afternoon from Admiral Kempff
dated Chefu. June 21. saying that
Tientsin is being bombarded and that
much of the Amerlcau consulate as well
as foreign concessions Is being de-
Etroyed. A relief party Is en route 'to
Tientsin, including 130 American marines
under Major Walter.
LONDON, June 22, 3:30 a, m.â The
United States gunboat Monocacy was two
miles up the Pelho River when the inter
national fleet began the bombardment of
the Taku forts. According to the Shang
hai correspondent of the Dally Express
Ehe was shot through the bows. The cor
respondent fays that Chinese riflemen on
both banks of the river attacked her, but
ur.FUccess fully.
The scarcity of authentic news with
reference to the situation continues. Ad
miral KempfTs dispatch to the United
States Navy Department announcing that
Tientsin is being bombarded was promi
nently used by the London papers and
commented upon as Indicating a change
for the worse.
The British Admiralty does not believe
the report of the death of Admiral Sey
mour, commander of the international re
lief column, and semi-official assurances
are given that there seems to be not the
slightest evidence tr> back up such a re
j>ort.
It is pointed out th<Â»* Admiral Seymour
had sufficient supplies to enable him to
go to Peking and get back. "We are
hopeful." says the semi-official announce
ment, '"that Vlnce he ha? not done the lat
ter he has done the former." Â¦
A dispatch to the Associated Press from
Shanghai, dated yesterday, says: "The
Consuls met to-day to consider the situa
tion, which, in the absence of news from
/Peking, is looked upon as particularly
threatening. Grave fears still exist as to
the safety of the Europeans In Peking. It
was agreed to wire to the senior Consul
at Chefu to communicate with the senior
officers at Taku asking for immediate as
sistance in communicating direct with Pe
kJngr. which they believe can be brought
about through Shrnjr. director of tele
graphs. They advise that Sheng be asked
to explain the interruption of communi
cations."
The stoppage of trade has thrown 10,000
coolies out of work at Shanghai. All the
English ladies at Tientsin left there Sat
urday by a train for Taku. Shanghai
wires that they had some exciting ex
periences and would not have got through
except fÂ«r the assistance of the Chinese
troops. The Boxers made several desper
ate attempts to attack the train.
Taking advantage of the political dis
orders bands of robbers are pillaging, In
the vicinity of Sam Chun. The Chinese
authorities are powerless.
Precautions have been taken to prevent
disturbances in British territory. The ex
planation given at Hongkong of the fail
ure of Li Hung Chang to go to Peking
is that there is a rising on the border of
the Kowloon Hinterland.
The Singapore correspondent of the
Dally Express, telegraphing yesterday,
6&ys: "Kang Yung We!, the reformer, as-

from Admiral Remey at ; Manila" states
that the Zaflro sailed yesterday from Ca

icating with Captain "Wilde of the Oregon

GERMANY WILL SEND
MORE MEN TO CHINA
BERLIN, June 21.â Lu Hai Houan, Chi
nes^ Minister In Berlin, received a repre
sentative of the Associated Press to-day.
In reply to questions he denied emphatic
ally that the Chinese Government meant
to wage war and declared that the com
manders of the Taku forts undoubtedly
acted without instruction. He referred to
the reports of the murder of Baron von

gations as "fables." "When asked from
what source he had received such infor
mation, and especially in view of the fact
that the other day he had admitted that
he -had received no cable advices from

things from the general intentions of his
Government and from his own general In
structions.
Count von Bulow, Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, to-day -Joined Em
peror William at Kiel to give his Majesty
an oral account of the Chinese imbroglio.
It is probable that he will postpone his
vacation and continue to direct the For

developed to ; indicate that the -Kaiser

but It Is understood that if more warning
news is received the Government will send
out a volunteer army taken from all the
regiments of the army up to 10,000 men.
The volunteers needed to bring the two

THE LATE COUNT MTjaAVIEFF.
ST. PETERSBURG.â June 21.â The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count
MuravienV died suddenly this morning. Count Muravleff : had; just finished
hie morning-, cup of coffee and had ordered his lunch' when ' he fell In an
apoplectic fit and expired In a few minutes, between 9 and' 10 o'clock.'
XEW YORK, June 21â A special to the- World f rom â¢, London says Count. Mi
chael MouraviefT, Russian Minister: of Foreign Affairs," died suddenly in St." Peters
burg to-day. It. Is announced from there that apoplexy was fatal to Count Mour
avieff. but here In diplomatic circles Mouravleff 's ; strange death; Is 'attributed to
poison, just as the death} of his predecessor as Russian Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, Prince Alexander Lobenoff , who died suddenly in 1896,- was attributed: to' poi-' y
son. Diplomats here say Mouravleff has been a' restraining influence on the ultra'
forward parfy at St.; Petersburg: In the present crisis he has "been; desperately,
struggling to preserve concerted action with all the powers. _ His firm position .was
opposed to most of the Czar's councilors, who arefor. pressing Russia's advantage
regardless of consequences. So Mouravleff was'put out of the way. .
Count Michael Muriavieff was" born in 1845, of afamily that has been promi
nently identified with the life of Russia ever since' the, time of ;: Catherine II.
His grandfather waa the Governor of Vllna Â¦ and . Polish Lithuania at the . time of
the insurrection thirty-five years ago, who crushed the Insurgents Into submis

many other offices he went to Paris, tome twenty < years ago, -as ; Councilor of

later was the Embassador of the Czar at the Danish court. : ' -; . ~, .

It was thought for a time throughout' the other courts of Europe that his In

OFFICIALS HOPE THAT
THE WORST IS PAST
WASHINGTON, June 2Lâ Admiral
Remey, from Manila, supplemented his
previously brief dispatch relative to the
ealllng of the Zaflro by one later In the
day announcing- the departure of the Iris
from Manila for Taku. The Iris is a
water boat, but on this trip she carried
a quantity of supplies for Admiral
Kempff's little squadron as well as a
cargo of good coal, a commodity which
*ill be sorely needed by the time she ar-
The developments of to-day, apart from
those at Tientsin, gTeatly encourages the
officials here in their hop* that the worst
is past in China and that the difficulty
can be settled without any very serious
change of the present status of the coun
try, at least In its relations with the outer
world The State Department is much
gratified at the attitude of the powers.
So far as It Is informed there is no dif
ference of opinion or intention among the
different powers -respecting the Chinese
situation. Their object is simply to re
store peace, protect life and property and
leave all further questions for future set
tlement. So far as can be gathered there
is not a dissenting voice among the pow
ers In answer to the proposition made by
the United States to limit the operations
of the foreign armies and navies In China
to that simple programme. If there is a
contrary purpose entertained anywhere
the particular power has not signified
that fact.

United Society of Christian Endeavor,

SUDDEN DEATH OF
COUNT MURAVIEFF
BOXERS SLAUGHTERED BY SOLDIERS
LONDON, June 21. â The soldiers and Boxers are said to be massacring )
each other, and the Chinese Manchus are also reported to be engaged in ,
mutual slaughter. <
Prince Tuan Is alleged to have sacked^and burned the palace. The Em- â¢
peror Is reported to have been killed,' the Dowager Empress Is represented as â¢
missing and in some quarters it is believed she has committed suicide. '
All this purports to have been contained in a letter from Peking received \
by a hig-h official Chinaman at Shanghai, where it Is hoped the desperate .
struggle between the leaders and the Dowager Empress will prevent the sects .
combining against the Europeans. > . . â¢
The Shanghai correspondent of the Times says: "Great destruction . was â¢
caused by the Boxers in the native quarters of Tientsin on June 15, but the '
presence of foreign troops In the foreign settlement protected that. The ',
native press asserts that there are bitter dissensions In the Manchuria â¢.
party." â¢
MINISTER WU SAYS CHINA
IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
WASHINGTON. June 21.â Minister Wu
was seen to-day after his i visit to the
State Department. He said that Secre
tary Hay had expressed his gratification
at the news the Minister had brought from
\ lceroy L,iu of the three great Yang-tse-
Kiang provincesâ Klangsu, Klangsi and
Anhuiâ to the effect that he, in conjunc
tion with his â¢ colleague, ..Viceroy Chan of
the provinces of Hunan and Hupeh, were
fully competent to maintain order and in
sure protection to . all foreigners within
their Jurisdiction and asking that no for
eign forces be landed within these pro
vinces. Minister Wu said that he would
reply to Viceroy Liu and repeat Secretary
Hay's assurances that no foreign troops,
or more specifically, no United States
forces, would Invade his territory so long
as peace and order are preserved therein.
The assurance of alien forces In these
provinces, said Minister Wu, far from
having a subduing effect on any disorder
that might be brewing under cover, would
only bring the flame, if the sparks were
there. â¢ : .
The Minister was very much incensed
at a suggestion published this morning
that he be held as hostage by this Gov
ernment for the safety of Minister Gonger
and the legation at Peking. He charac
terized the writer as a narrow-minded
pedant, and a person who was incompe
tent to speak on international affairs. *Q
"If a state of war existed in China,' the
Minister said, "1 should ask .for my pass
Â¦ports or they would be handed me. That,
with emphasis, "is the only course that
would be followed if such were the case.
The Minister reiterated his former state
ments, scouting the very suggestion of a
state of war between China and the Unjt
"Was your Government at "Washington
responsible," he queried, "for the Italian
lynching at Tallulah? No. Neither is
the Government of China responsible for
the depredations of lawless mobs, over
which movements it has no control. Does
not the action of the Empress Dow-aper
in degrading the commandant of the Taku
forts for firing upon the foreign fleet prove
that the imperial Government had no part
The Minister was surprised and sorry
to hear of the report that LI Hung Chang
had reconsidered his Intention and would
not go to Peking. He said he had great
faith in Chang's ability to relieve the sit
uation there. He also expressed his be
lief that Sevmour's column had arrived
at Peking and that the legations there
are safe.
Berts that Russian agents precipitated, if
they did not entirely organize, the pres
ent disturbances for purely Russian pur
poses."
A dispatch to the Dally Telegraph from
Shanghai says that the missionaries from
Tsang Chou have safely arrired at Wei
Hal Wei.

Special Disjjatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. June 21.â Nome news
papers received here tell of the finding of
traces of a tragedy by reindeer herders
in a district contiguous to Nome. Dr. W.
H. Gamble, superintendent of the reindeer
station at Cape Denbigh, says his herd
ers have discovered the body of a, man,
on whose remains papers were found tell
ing of terrible privations and starvation.
Thrse papers state that the victim was
sailing in a small boat from St. Michaei
to Nome, and after experiencing the
greatest hardships landed at the point
which he believed to be an Island. A num
ber of Indians assisted him to land. On
the 10th of December, he writes, he was
there nfty-two days waiting for the ice
to form, that he might get off the island,
as he called It. Writing on December 14
he states that he came from British Co
lumbia and had been on the trail for two
years. On December 15 he states thai
while at the coast at a village, presuma
bly Shatollk, he helped two men two days
building a boat named Frank Leslie
which was painted black.
The name of the unfortunate man Is.
John Bacon, and the papers on him were
addressed to James Cahlll, followed by
an Illegible word commencing with thÂ»
letter H. Dr. Gamble said these were all
the particulars he could glean from thÂ©
Laplanders, but he would go out and in
vestigate the case and have the body bu
rled away from the dogs and ravens
In a full report of discoveries made by
the- doctor a short . time afterward - to
United States "Marshal Lee, It transpires
that the records of the dead man showeo
that his death was directly due . to the
Indians, whose attitude was so threaten
ing that he was obliged to give them the
bulk of ; his scanty, supply of food.. The
record Is one of the most pitiful in the
annals of the north.

Supreme Court Upholds the Booth

SPRINGFIELD, 111.. June 21.â The Su

of the lower court which convicted A. V.
Booth of Chicago of unlawfully contract-
Ing In- writing with the Weare Commis
sion Company an option to buy 10,000
bushels of corn at a future time, cohtrary
to the statute.
The decision Is Important in that It de
clares the Illinois law regarding puts and
calls to be valid.: The defense was 'based
on constitutional grounds. The court does
not hold. that a contract to buy grain' for
future delivery is unlawful, but holds that
the Booth-Weare contract - did < not Â» bind
Booth to take the corn on. deli very day
and was merely a gamble in, prices' of

Eumassi.
ACCRA. June 21.â Sir Frederick Hodg
son, Governor of the Gold Coast Colony,
according to reports from Kumassi, was
wounded ln the shoulder during 1 the recent
sortie from the fort. It Is also rumored
that eight officers: were killed.
Provisions at Kumaasi are scarce and
there are many wounded. The investment
is so complete that.no one is able to

the native population. Day by day the
position is becoming more precarious, and
there are no prospects of relief.

exercise of personal rights accorded to Ameri
cans by their constitution.
Sixthâ Establishment at civil governments at
Manila and ln the provinces.
Seventhâ Expulsion of the friars.

SAN JOSE, June 21.â The trustees of
the State Normal School, at their
annual meeting to-day, wielded the
ax freely and when they emerged
from the executive session the
heads of seven of the most prominent
teachers had been lopped off. Heading
the list was Principal James McXaugh
ton, who Is succeeded by Morris Elmer
Dailey, for the past year vice principal,
rhe others dropped are: Lucy M. Wash

tions. The former is to engage in other
ausinese. and the latter goes to Germanv
:o study. Miss Caroline L. Fiedler, teaeh
;r in the training school, was elected head
?f the training department.
The dropping or Principal McNaughton
2id not create any surprise, as for the
'ear he ha* been at the head of the school
;he institution has lacked discipline and
there has b^en much trouble. He came
here a year ago from Arizona under a
rlou<J and thÂ«> Alumni .Association pre
ferred charges of immorality and incom
jeteticy against him. On investigation,
lou-ever, the trustees upheld McNaugh-
McNaughton's Successor.
Principal Dailey. who succeeds him, has
seen connected with the school for the
iast year. He formerly was Superintend
-nt of the Fresno City Schools and is a
rraduato of Indiana University.
The other teachers dismissed had been
-ennc-eted with the school for a lone time.
t several of them for nearly twenty years.

In contact with it the explosion occurred.
The concussion was heard all over town
and ln consequence attracted everybody
to the roundhouse before the flre alarm
was sounded. In a brief time hundreds
ofexcited people from both this city and
Kern were on the scene. A large num
ber of men are employed at the machine
shop and roundhouse and therefore many
families of Kern had members working
in the shops. When- the names burst sky
ward the excitement was Intense. Women
ran frantically about the burning build
ing wringing their hands and eagerly in
quiring for the welfare of their dear ones.
ThiB community has never witnessed such
terrible excitement.
Young Gilmore was~the only. one of the
victims who had any relatives ln town.
His old mother lived -within a block of

"hogs." used for -pulling heavy freights
over the Tehachapi grade. From all ap
pearances none of them will be fit fÂ»r
more than scraplron. The two that were
saved did not escape without considerable
damage. The loss will seriously interfere
with the company's, business. The shop
has a'weU-drille&nre company of Its own,
with modern apparatus, which was gal
lantly handled during the flre. Nothing
was left undone to save life and property.
BAKERSFTELD, June 21.â The South
ern Pacific roundhouse' at Kern was com
pletely.' destroyed by Â¦ lire; to-day. Two
men lost their lives in the conflagration
and several were ' injured. Thirteen loco
motives were in the house at the time.
Two that had steam up were saved. The
remainder were badly warped and dam
aged. The estimated loss is about J350.000.
The fire Is supposed to have originated
from an explosion of gas. in the oil tank
of engine 1327, which had been run in for
repairs. Machinist Qulun, .late of.. .San
Bernardino, was sent to fix the engine.
The tank had been. relieved of oil some
time before. The Chinese . helper said
Qulnn went ln the pit under the engine
with a lighted candle. In a few minutes
an explosion occurred and, before the Chi
naman could flee from tha house the
wbole interior of the building was a mass
of flames. The Chinaman was quite bad
ly burned. After the fire the charred re
mains of Qulnn were found under the en
gine, as if he had been In the act of
crawling from the olt. The Remains of
Byrd Gilmore, an apprentice, aged 17
years, were also found burned to a crisp
alongside the engine. The building was
of very combustible material, the â¢ roof
being composed of tar paper and as
phaltum.
Machinist Dearbury and Boilermaker
John Kennedy of Los Angeles were among
the injured. Kennedy died this evening.

To compare the commerce of 1900 with
that of 1S0O Is to contrast the railway, the
steamship, the telegraph and the tele
phone of to-day with the Conestoga
wagon, the sailing vessel and the mall
coach of- a century ago. Then railways
and steamships and telegraphs were un
known, and as a consequence only the lit
tle margin of territory bordering directly
upon the rivers, lakes and oceans could
successfully participate in that which Is
now usually designated as commerce. To
be sure,. the term commerce applies, strict
ly speaking, to the Interchange of com
modities or traffic ln ' merchandise wher
ever found, but the term to-day is usually
meant to apply | to exchanges between na
tions, continents or great business centers.
The. commerce existing among the conti
nents a. century ago was necessarily car
ried on by sailing vessel*. True, experi
ments with steamboats had been made in
the. closing years of the eighteenth cen
tury, but they had not been put into prac
tical operation until after the beginning of
the nineteenth century, it being ln 1S1D
I that the steamer Savannah made a voy
age from Savannah*, Ga., to Liverpool.
England, occupying even then twenty-two
days for a trip which steamships now eas
ily make In a week. The first vessel en-
I gaged in commerce between New Tork
and China occupied from February 22, 17S4,
until May 11, 17S3, nearly flfeen months,
in making the trip to that country, dis
posing of Its cargo and reaching New
York with the' goods which It brought In
exchange. The railway, of course, did not
come until toward the middle of the cen
tury, and as a consequence only the little
margin of land bordering upon the lakes,
rivers and oceans could participate in the
interchange of the heavier commodities,
since transportation by wagons or pack
animals was extremely slow and expen
sive, making profitable Interchange Impos
sible except In the extremely light and
very valuable articles. The caravans
which transported the silks and spices
from the Orient to European countries
consumed many months ln their trip, and
the heavy expense of transporting even
the lightest and most t valuable articles
was increased by the heavy losses by rea
son of bandits on land, while the vessels
which transported goods by sea were also
in constant danger from pirates, who
swarmed the most frequented parts of the
ocean. A month was consumed in sending
communications or merchandise between
the United States and those parts of Eu
rope which are now reached by telegraph
In a few moments and by steamship in
less than six days. Communication which
is now Instantaneous not only among cit
ies upon our cwn continent, but among
the various continents and all parts of the
world, then was no more rapid than, the
transmission of merchandise. The Bale or
purchase of goods ln Europe o^ the
Orient, which Is now frequently performed
by wire in a few minutes, was then meas
ured by weeks or months, and this relates
as well to the transmission of the neces
sary funds for completing a business
transaction as to the mere order for the
purchase or sale of the articles entering
into commerce. Then weeks were occu
pied In sending an order for the purchase
of goods, and It had to be accompanied
by actual money current with the trader
at all points, which thus lay idle during
the long. period occupied by its transmis
sion. To-day both the order and the
funds may be transmitted from city to
city and continent to continent ln a mo^
ment of time. Then a fringe of territory
from fifteen to thirty miles ln width along
the navigable waterways was all that
could successfully forward its heavier
products t.o.the market, and as a conse
quence vast areas of productive land and
untold supplies cf mineral wealth lay un
touched, undeveloped and valueless from
a commercial standpoint.
But with the application of steam power
to land transportation conditions quickly
changed. Railways permeate our entire
country and bring every part of It Into
touch with every other part, and with all
the world. Tnese great transporting
facilities are steadily pushing their
way toward the equator and also
gaining a foothold in the south
temperate zone, and thus bringing its
enormous areas of fertile land and pro
ductive forests Into touch with the great
consuming world. The cost of railway
construction has been greatly reduced,
and with this the cost of transportation,
so that many articles which only a few
years ago could not enter Into commerce
now form an important feature of the
transactions between the great business
centers of the globe.
The advance of transportation facilities
upon the ocean has been almost as won
derful as upon the land. In the first quar
ter of the century commerce was com
pelled to rely upon the sailing vessel for
the transportation of bulky as well as the
more valuable and costly articles of mer
chandise. When toward the middle of the
century the construction of iron vessels
began, and almost simultaneously the
screw propeller was substituted for the
paddle-wheel steamer, the wonders of
ccean transportation developed very rap
idly. These improvements in turn were
followed by the use of steel . Instead of
iron, bv which the carrying power of the
vessel "was Increased 20 per cent. With,
these developments came an enormous in
crease In both size, spctd and carrying
power of the vessels, and the great steel
steamships which to-day ply the ocean in
everv direction carry each as milch as a
considerable fleet of sailing vessels car
ried at the beginning of the century. They
transport' goods with much greater speed
and at a trifling cost compared with that
of earlier periods. Not only have they an
enormous advantage in speed and carry
ing capacity but In the matter of safety
and the power of propulsion against head
winds and storms there is given to ocean
traffic an enormous advantage over that
of the beginning of the century. Another
great gain. to ocean traffic which has come
with the last half of the century is the
elimination of piracy from the seas and
the freedom from losses of property and
even life from these causes.
It Is impossible in the limits of a study
of this character to do more than outline
the causes of the wonderful change ln
commerce, and especially in 'International
commerce, and to suggest some of the
more prominent facts with reference to
Its growth both as to causes and results.
As already indicated, the causes are the
increased facilities for the production and
transmission of articles - entering Into
commerce and Â¦ of rapid transmission of
thought between man and man ln what
ever part of the world. At the beginning
of the century telegraphs and cables were
unknown and It was not- until after the
middle of the period urider consideration
that they began to contribute to the facil
ities of commerce, while the practical ap
plication of steamships and railways was
but slightly earlier. At the. beginning of
the century there were no steamships and
the tonnage of the world's shipping was.
In round numbers. 4,000 000 tons. .
With the application of steam the carry
ing power of a vessel was greatly in
creased, because with the Increased speed
It could make so many more trips In a
given time and as a consequence statisti
cians ' usually estimate that the annual
carrving power of a steam vessel is four
times that of a sailing vessel of equal -ton
.nape Hence the Introduction of steam
upon the oceans -and rivers multiplied
verv rapidly the carrying power of the
vessels, so that the carrying power of the
world's shippine. which In 1S0O was 4.000.0fÂ»
tonÂ« had by 1530 become 15,000.000 tons, by
1S75 3O.OC3.O0O tons and at the present time
Is probably 65.000,000 tons. The latest offi
cial Information puts the tonnage of the
sailing vessels In 1S99 at over 10.000.000 tons
and that of steam vessels at over 13.000.ooo
tons, and reducing this to the sail stand
ard, by which everything was; measured
a- century ago. it gives the "carrying
power" at; about the figure named.
Meantime railways, which are ~ to â¢ the
land all that Bteamshlps are to the oc?an>
and even more, because they bring all of
the land surface In contact with the water
upon which sail or steam vessels may
transport goods, have increased witn
equal rapidity. At the beginning of the
century there were almost none; by ISoO
the total mileage of railways ln the world
was, in round terms, about 25.WW miles;
about 1S75." however, the total reached
nearly 200,000 miles and now amounts to
430.000 miles, or sufficient to engirdle the
earth eighteen times. The total value of
the commerce between nations, which at
the beginning of the century was less than
?2.uOO,OoO,000, is now about J20.uoo.0OU.uO0.
There are other causes which account
ln part for the rapid growth of the
world's commerce. A century ago the
commerce of the Orient was a sealed book
to the nations of Europe and America.
True, the great commercial companies of
turopeâ the East India Company of Eng
land and similar but less powerful organi
zations ln other European countrles^ â car
ried on commerce in a limited way with
India and China, establishing what they
called "factories" at points on the coasts
of those countries, where a limited com
merce was carried on with the immediate
ly surrounding population through tha
medium of local merchants. The factory,
so called, was not a factory in the sense In
which the word is now generally used, but
a depot where the company deposited its
goods and sold them through a "factor"
or agent, who was placed in charge of
them. These factors were only permitted
to transact business through certain indi
viduals designated for that purpose, thla
being especially the case ln China, and
it was not until nearly the middle of the
century that Great Britain, closely Tol
loweu by the United States, brought about
the opening of trade ln China. In 1&4 tha
L nited States accomplished the same re
sults in Japan. These incidents were
quickly followed by a general awakening
of Interest ln commercial matters
throughout the Orient. As a result the
commerce of the countries lying commer
cially adjacent to Manila, now so familiar
to the people of the United States, at
present amounts to more than COoO.000.Ooo
per annum, their purchases alone from
?}, he Â£ -. P arts Â°f the world amounting to
Jltw.OoO.ow for every month ln the yearâ a
/act which seems to Justify the people of
the United States in now expecting in
creased commerce with that part of the
. As to the share which the United States
has had in this wonderful development of
commerce, and the part which it now
plays in the enormous trajflc of the
world, the story is one of equal interest,
and discloses developments even moro
rapid and more surprising. At the begin
ning of the century our total commerce
amounted to but J16O.CO0.00O. against more
than J2.Q0O,0OO.0OU to-day, and even that
was something phenomenal as compared
with only a decade earlier. The record of
American commerce in the opening years
of the century la a peculiar one. The wars
between the great nations of Europe had
rendered It almost impossible for Euro
pean shipping to engage In International
commerce, both because of the destruction
wt 8h| P s b >* those of the countries
which were at war with each other and
by the fact that their people and their
shipping were compelled to give their at
tention to these wars. American sailing
ships, known as "clipper" ships, were then
the llnest and fastest in the world, and as
a result of these conditions in Europe
they obtained a large share of the carry
1&v5 rado S f tho This fact, coupled
with the increasing supplies which the
people of the United States were able to
furnish to meet the wants of Europe, le
gitimately increased our commerce very
considerably. In addition to this, how
ever, our apparent commerce was greatly
swelled by peculiar circumstances. The
Iaw3 of Great Britain prohibited the trans
portation of commodotles between her col-
e f ? nd l the mother country In other than
British ships; but as this was then im
practicable and there was great demand
in England for the products of the colo
nies, the laws were construed to permit
the transportation, of this cLaas ot gooii-t
In American vessels, provided the goods
from the colonies were first landed In the
I nited States, and so could be reported as
exports from this country. A further con
struction permitted vessels loading in the
British colonies merely to touch American
ports, and, without even unloading the
goods, report them as Imports Into and
exports from the United States. As a con
sequence. thi3 peculiar condition appar
ently swelled our commerce greatly and
accounts in part for the fact that it In
creased from J43.0CO.000 in 17S0 to J161,0G0.0iÂ«
in 1S00. and to J246.000.000 in 1S07. With the
troubles which rose between the United
States and Great Britain, however, with
reference to th& imprassment of American
sailors, and which led to the war of 1812.
this apparently enormous increase Auickly
disappeared, and the records of our com-
m ?"^'/wS' h L ch ln 1S07 shÂ° w ed a total of
f 216^-^ dropped to JSO.000.000 in 1SCS. and
to J2O.n00.00O ln Iil4.. under the embargo act
and the activities of war. - With the close
of the war commerce resumed something
like normal conditions, and gradually In
creased, although it was not until 1S31
ftS?fin.? ur ex PÂ°f t3 reached as much as J100.
000.000, save in the years 1S06 and 1S07.
From that time to the middle of the cen
tury the growth was fairly rapid, and in
I5m f5Â« e niw xpo tt? to l th , B flr3t tlme reached
J2OO,GÂ«>n,0CO. while the Imports ln two pre
â¢cedlng yearsâ IS51-52â had passed that
figure.
With the phenomenal changes In trans
portation methods which began *o make
themselves felt about the middle of ttie
century, our commerce Increased rapRJly
Large tracts of land, capable of produc
ing the articles which the world required
were brought under cultivation, and the
construction of railways and steamships
so facilitated transportation that our ex
ports Increased enormously. This was es
pecially true of cotton and breadstuffs.
With the general activity which followed
the close of the warâ the great Increase
in railway construction, the construction
of the transcontinental lines," which open
ed vast eraln-producing areas and in
creased our ability to supply the world"s
demand for breadstunTs â came another in
crease, and by 1S60 the exports for the
first time reached J3flO.000.00O and by 1S71
had passed the JWO.OOO.OOO line. Quickly
following this came the development of
our manufacturing Industries, and with It
the beginning of exportation of manufac
tures., which In 1S60 amounted to only J40.
000.000. in 1S79 to J63.00O.0OO and In 1SS0 to
J102.POO.000. As a consequence of these
developments in production and manufac
ture our exports in 1573 pawed the S300.Â«
OOu.OCO line, in 1S77 the Jo00.000.000 line in
1S79 exceeded J70O.0OO.00O and in 1SS0 were
more than jsoo.ooo.ooo. In 1SS1 they were
more than $300,000,000, In 1552 more than
Jl.OOO.OQrtjOOO. In 15% 'over J1.23O.0OO.0OOO and
in ln.rt wem likely to reach J1.25O.00O.00O.
Meantime the Imports have increased
but not nearly so rapidly as the exports
since our country has especial facilities
for producing nearly all of the articles
which its people require. Imports, which
never reached the J20O.0O0.0OO line until the
middle of the century, exceeded $300 000,
000 by 1S56. J4OO.00O.00O by L*6Â«, 1300,000.000
by 1S71. J600.000.0O> in 1S72. J70O.000.OU0 In 13S8
and passed the JSOO.OOO.tXiO line in 1S91.
The principal change In recent years in
our Importations Is In the character of
the articles Imported rather than In quan
tity. This Is due to the- rapid develop
ment of manufacturing Industries in the
United States, by which our factories are
every year supplying a larger share of
the wants of our people, but for that rea
son are requiring additional quantities of
raw materials from abroad, of the class
which. cannot be produced at home, such
as fibers, rubber, hides and raw silk. The
quantity of sugar, tea. coffee and other
tropical products consumed by our rap-
Idly increasing population Is constantly
growing, and in the demand for this class
of articles of tropical growth for use as
food or in manufacturing lies the cause
of the principal Increase In our irnporia
tions during the last few years.
The. developments of our commerce, ltÂ»
rapid. growth and its chancre in character
have not yet seen their limit.. We are so
rapidly Increasing 1 our production of thÂ»
great articles required in all parts of thÂ»
worldâ bnÂ»adstuff.>Â». cotton, iron and steel,
coal; copper and manufactures of all
classes â that there seems every reason to
bellve that we shall steadily increase our
share 'In the world's commerce, as we
have been doing for many years. Espe
cially shall we advance In our ability to
supply the wants of that great part of
the world, which draws its supplies of
manufactures* from the north temperate
xone, and take in exchange its *u?ar.
tropical fruits, coffee, tea and apices. Its
hides, rubber, fibers and silk, which we
require for food or use in manufacturing.

DESIRE MORE RIGID
GAMBLING ORDINANCE
Police Commissioners Bequest Super
visors to Give Them Authority
to Abolish Poker Games.
President Xewhall of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners and Chief of Police
Sullivan appeared before the Supervisors'
Police Committee yesterday and made an
urgent plea that a new gambling or
dinance be adopted, so that public gam
bling could be abolished under its pro
visions.
"As the gambling ordinance exists at
.present,'.' said Mr. Newhall, "the Commis
sioners are powerless to enforce it. We
cannot interfere with gambling houses
now in operation, and I have reliable in
formation that new ones are about to be
opened up. The gambling carried on at
the Cafe Royal is In such a flourishing
condition that games will be established
on similar lines at the Baldwin Annex. We
earnestly request that proper legislation
be enacted by the board to give the Po
lice Commissioners authority to close up
the resorts."
Chief Sullivan stated that the remarks
of Mr. Newhall applied more particularly
to poker-playing, which had -been decided
by the court to be a game of skill and

Discovery in Auditor's Office of Seri

â¢ Public Works/'
That extremely loose methods charac
terize many of the departments of the
municipal government was manifested
yesterday by a discovery made by the
deputies In the Auditor's ofllce. S. C.
Murray, a contractor and builder, pre
sented a receipt for $20 which he had de
posited with the Board of Public Works
for opening a street for a side sewer on

Wells found two demands for $20 each

I have heretofore expressed myself I
would have swimming tanks, gymnasiums
and: even boxing lessons for the pupils."
Charter Prevents Paying.
The provision In the charter requiring
that all cobblestones with which a street
may have been paved must be moved to
the Corporation Yard when improvements
are to be made will result in Sansome
street, between Sutter and Bush, going
without a fine bituminous pavement for
some time to come. Some time ago the
property: owners along the block men
tioned petitioned the Board of Public
Works for a bituminous pavement to be
laid at . their own expense. A contractot
had agreed to do the work for $3000, but
as,. he had figured closely he requested
that he be permitted to retain the cob
bles, which are worth about $125. This
would allow him a reasonable profit on
his contract and insure a fine pavement
on the street, but the charter prevents
the accomplishment of the Improvement
at least for some time. In this connection
It may be stated that the board has placed
the block in question on its schedule of
streets to be improved. The expense will
therefore ultimately be borne by the city.
When the work Is done it will cost $50 to
remove the cobbles to the Corporation
Yard in addition to the cost of repaying
the block, which will. fall on the city.

Undervaluation of Invoices Will Be
Resorted To No Longer by Un
scrupulous Importers.
Customs Collector Jackson received a
circular from O. I* Spaulding, Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, yesterday,
calling attention- to an evil which the de
partment has determined to abate. It has
been the practice for a certain class or
unscrupulous persons to enter small quan
tities of goods on appraisement orders,
thereby taking advantage of a low valu
ation by the Appraiser and avoiding tha
penalties provided in the eveni .,: the Ap
praiser nxing a higher valuation. This
practice will be stopped by the enforce
ment of the following circular:
"To Collectors and other officers of thÂ«
customs: Investigation shows that th*
privilege of entering, imported goods, es
pecially tailor-made clothing, on appraise
ment orders (Cat. No. 608, Art. &Â» Cus
toms Regulations. 1S32). has led to fraud
ulent practices. Ti appears that shippers
frequently forward to their correspond
ents in the United States largely under
valued Invoices, and the total value being
less than J100, entry by appraisement or
der is made. Importers thus escape the
payment of additional duty or forfelture
of the goods when values are advanced
by appraising officers.
"With a view to tha proper protection
of the revenue all persons who make ap
plication to enter Imported goods on ap
praisement ordÂ«rs will be required to stata
under oath the value of the goods, and
if upon appraisement the goods are found
to be undervalued the provisions of sec
tion 32 of the act of July 24, 1S97, amend-*
Ing section 7 of the customs administra
tive act, will apply." -

Boasted the Health Board
When the regular business was finished
Chairman Stone announced that the ex
ecutive committee had a resolution to sub
mit, with a .request that It be adopted.
Secretary Cutter then read the following:
The Republican State Central Committee of
California, comoosed of mrmbfn from every
county in the State, tn convocation assembled,
unanimously resolves:
That the course of the Democratic Board of
Health and Federal Quarantine Officer for San
Francisco in quarantining, the former a portion
of the city and the latter the entire State,
without any reasonable ground therefor la
either instance, thereby causing to California a
loss In reputation and - In values hardly to be
estimated, merits and f ecelvea the condemna
tion and execration of all good citizens.
That the prompt response of President Mc-
Klniey to the urgent appeals made to him by
the Governor, by thiÂ» commute* and others,
by directing the Immediate withdrawal of tha
unwarranted order quarantining the State, de
serves and receives the heartfelt tratltude and
thanks of our people.
That the thanks of this committee and ot all
the people of California rejrardles* of party arÂ»
also due to our fearless executive. Henry T.
Gage, who has devoted so much time and effort
in probing this senseless scare to the bottom,
and with such successful results.
That the willful and wanton abtiÂ»e of power
displayed by the United States Quarantine Offi
cer for San Francisco, in Quarantining this
State, in bold defiance of the report of the
Governor to the Secretary of State of the
United States and the decision of the United
States Circuit Court, both, arrived at after the
most careful and exhaustive Investigation, con
clusively shows that he should not be permitted
longer to exercise authority within our limit*;
and we therefore respectfully but earnestly re
quest the President to order his recall.
That we, the members of the republican
State Central Committee of California, basing
the assurance not only upon the conclusions
reached by the Governor and the Federal
court, but in many Instances upon our own
personal examination and knowledge, assure
the people of our sister States that there has
never been a case of bubonic plague developed
in any part of this State, and that they may
freely come in our midst without fear, or toucti '
and taste our fruit and other edible products
in their own homes without danger. . -
Resolved. That the secretary of this commit
tee be directed to forward a certtfl>d copy of
the above to the President of the United States.
As the reading of the resolutions
progressed many of the sentences eliciteJ
outbursts of applause. The vote on adop
tion was unanimous and spirited.
Before the session dissolved a resolution
was adopted that thirty-five Instead of
fifty-five members should constitute a
quorum. The committee adjourned to tha
call of the chair.

cers of this committee.
J. Alva Watt seconded the motion to
adopt and the resolutions -were adopted.
W. M. Cutter, secretary of the commit
tee, read the call for a convention as
recommended by the State Executive Com
mittee.
H. C. Dibble suggested that all refer
ence to Congressional district conventions
be eliminated, as the law provided a
manner for holding such conventions In
the absence of any direction by the gov
erning- body.
Judge Rosa of San Mateo favored an
amendment to the call to provide for hold
ing joint Senatorial and Assembly district
conventions. J. Alva Watt feared that
tne Ross amendment would increase the
complications. Judge Â¦ Dibble contended
that If provision was made for Congres
sionial District conventions similar pro
vision should be- made for Senatorial and
Assembly district conventions. On reflec
tion he Miegested the retention of the
paragraphs relating to Congressional dis
tricts and the adoption of the Ross amend
ment relating to nomination of Joint Sen
ators _ and Assemblymen. The Ross
amendment was adopted without further
discussion and is embraced in the official
call.
E. M. Buckley moved to amend the pro-
PnÂ° S / e t c^l by W^S thÂ« apportionment
In detail to each Assembly District of San
FVancisco. Alfred Bouvfer. chairman of
the Republican County Committee of San

pose of the amendment was to give this

by unanimous vote. Henry F. Kron of
Santa Cruz thanked the committee for the
honor conferred on the city which he rep
resented. "
_Edmund Burke of Santa 'Barbara and
" .t Prtc Â® ot Sonoma inquired If a con
vention other than the State convention
could adjourn to another place after meet-
Ing at Santk Cruz. The chairman replied
that such adjournment could be taken.
Tlie Convention CalL
On "otjon oi "W. S. Wood, seconded bv
Wakefleld Baker, the call for the conven
tion was adopted. Following is the official
call as amended and adopted:
The Republican State Central Committee of
California, ' the governing body of the Republi
can party of California, which at the last gen
eral election In this State polled more than
three per cent of the entire vote of the State,
in meeting assembled in the city and county of
San PrancUco, State of California, on this 21st
day of June, l!>00, hereby adopts thjs call for a
Republican State Convention to be held on the
2Sth day of August, 1900, at 2 o'clock p. m., at
the city of Santa Cruz.
That said State Convention shall be held for
the nomination of nine Presidential Electors to
be voted for by the electors throughout the
State of California at a general election to be
held in said State on Tuesday .November 6,
1900. and for the transaction of such other busi
ness as may be properly brought before eaid
convention.
That the said State Convention shall consist
of 6S2 delegates, and all of said 'delegates must
be elected at a primary election to be held In
each county of the State on Tuesday, August
14. 1900. and in accordance with the provisions
of the laws of this State.
That the apportionment of delegates to said
State Convention shall be one delegate for each
200 votes cast of the average vote and one dele-
EB-te for each remainder of 100 votes or over of
the av*rage vote cast In each county for the
llepubllcan candidates of the Republican party
for State officers, to wit: Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, Secretary of State, Controller.'Treas
urer, Attorney General, Surveyor General, Clerk
ThÂ© Mayor will not allow the City At
torney to defend Treasurer Brooks, who
fcas been served wifh a restraining order
preventing his paying any moneys out of
the St. Mary's Park fund of $125,000. This
order was issued on the petition of the
promoters of the park project shortly
after the decision was rendered by Judge
Beawell that the fund could be used for
other purposes.
As soon as Treasurer Brooks had read
the restraining order served on him he
turned It over to the City Attorney un
der the belief that that official must pros
ecute and defend for the city all actions
at law or In equity and all special pro
ceedings for or against the dry, accord
ing to the express terms of the charter.
But at this point Mayor Phelan, who 'ever
since the St. Mary's Park project was
first promulgated, has secretly or openly
opposed It es occasion demanded, stepped
In. He notified City Attorney Lane that
he muet turn over the papers he had re
ceived from Treasurer Brooks to Bishop
& Wheeler, attorneys for the several con
tractors, and who had conducted the case
before Judge Seawell with, to them, suc
cessful results.
"It will not do," quoth the Lilliputian
Mayor, "to allow Mr. Lane to defend the
restraining order. He is a prejudiced
party, as he had the temerity to. on the
request of the Board of Supervisors, ren
der an opinion that the St. Mary's Park
fund should be held inviolate, as it had
been apportioned for that express pur
pose. This new might cause Lane to
make a weak defense and consequently
the City Treasurer might be restrained
from using the fund to satisfy other
claims, and the park promoters would
eventually succeed in getting from the
city the money which they thought should
be used to purchase the park."
That is why City Attorney Lane re
ceived orders from the Mayor to forth
with deliver the papers to Bishop &
"Wheeler, who hopo to knock out the re-
Etralning order when it comes before
Judge Hebbard tor hearing next Monday
morning. There appears to be small com
fort In store for the park promoters, how
ever. Judging from, the remark let fall
yesterday by Auditor Wells.
"For all I know," said he; "the money
supposed to be set aside for the park may
have been already used for other pur
poses. According to the provision of the
charter, all unexpended balances, except
those in the School Library and a few
other funds, were transferred to the gen
eral fund on January S, 1300, when the
charter went Into effect, so it looks as
If the St. Mary's Park fund has no ex
istence at present."
Statistician Griffln in Trouble.
' The Mayor and members of the Board
cf Health held a special meeting yester
day for the purpose cf hearing charges

MERRIMAN PRESIDENT
REV. FREDERICK B. BART
LETT, rector of the Church
of St. Mary the Virgin^ on Union
street, this city, met his death
while .swimming in Sonoma Creek, about
three miles above the town yesterday aft
ernoon. The reverend gentleman and his
family were visiting Mrs. ThelJer at her
fuminer home since Monday. He had been
playing ball with several boys and on con
cluding the game -went to the creek for
"a dp," as he expressed it. Hutton Thel
ler, one of the boys with him, being a
good swimmer, went !n first and showed
his friend all thÂ© deep boles in the creek
to prevent any accident. Father Bartlett
was swimming leisurely on his back when
to rhe r-jrj-irise of all he suddenly called
for help. Theller immediately went to
his assistance and tried to render, aid,
but was pulled under the water by the
drowning man. ..,*â¢'.â¢'..
After a desperate struggle he succeeded
in getting loose and again tried to help
the unfortunate minister, but as he
reached him Father Bartiett went down
for the la.Â«t time. Help was summoned
and tie lifeless body was afterward taken
from the water and removed to the house.
The unfortunate nan came from the East
a few months ago to work on this coast.
He was 32 years of age.
Father Parrish, a co-worker, was in-
formed of the accident and left for So
noma last nlght/when arrangements for
the funeral were made. The remains will
be taken to San Francisco for interment.
Father Bartlett intended going home on
the afternoon train yesterday. Coroner
Price was notified and will hold the in
quest this evening. The hole in which
Father Bartlett was drowned was only
about .four feet wide and six deep. When
the rescuers arrived they could plainly
see the lifeless form on the creek bottom.
The', creek at this point - Is only about
eighteen feet wide.
REV. F. B. BABTLETT, WHO MET DEATH AT SONOMA.
"I've lived in California for fifty years,
and no man can call me a cur and live if
I can help it." , Â¦ Â¦ ". . . '
That l&~ the brief explanation - given
by aged John Sedgwick, freight agent of
the Southern Pacific Company In the office
at the foot of Vallejo street, -of why he
flred four shots from a revolver at his as
sistant, Thomas R. Doyle, yesterday
morning and came within a few Inches of
putting a bullet through that gentleman's
head. Falling eyesight and an unsteady
hand, due to nearly three-score years of
hard work, saved Doyle from death, for in
his younger days Sedgwick was never
known to miss the man he had drawn a
bead on.
Nobody was hurt after all, but to satisfy
the law Agent Sedgwick was arrested on
a warrant sworn to by Doyle charging
him with attempted murder. Hfe, was re
leased at once, however, on bonds of $1000
furnished by friends, many of whom
flocked to the rescue of the pioneer. Thera
are many versions of the affair, but no
two of them seem to agree, even as to the
general details. . .
The shooting took -place at 8:30 in the
morning Jn the office, tfalf an hour be
fore it occurred Doyle had assumed charge
in the absence of Mr. Sedgwick, and C. W.
Crabtree, Mrs.' M.- M. Hatch and Mrs. C.
Colson, clerks in the office, had taken their
accustomed stations. Sedgwick entered
the office and ordered Mrs. Hatch to tele
phone to some one. He was still outside
the railing when she reported that she
could not get the party desired, or some
thing to that effect. All the witnesses
agree that the aged agent made some un
complimeatary remark to the clerk. Doyle
took a hand in the proceedings and upon
Sedgwick resenting his interference called
the old man "a dirty cur."
Sedgwick sprang inside of the railing
and hastily took a revolver from the
drawer of his desk. The women screamed
with fright and Mrs. Hatch managed to
reach the door and make her escape be
fore the shooting commenced. Doyle saw
what was coming and tried to conceal
himself behind a desk that etood^in the
middle of the office. Crabtree and Mrs.
Colson tried to find shelter under the ta
bles. .
The gray-haired agent took a step for
ward and then opened fire upon- Doyle,
using the language given above. The first
shot went so close to the assistant agent's
head that he says he cojild feel his hair
move. Â¦ The next two must have gone very
wide of their mark, for no trace of them
can now be found. Sedgwick then seemed
to have some difficulty in cocking his pis
tol, which was a cheap one, and Doyle took
advantage of the lull in the bombardment
to charge upon his assailant with a chair.
A fourth shot was fired into the air, and
then Doyle staggered Sedgwick with a
blow from the piece of furniture, and be
fore the old man could recover himself
had escaped from the office, hatless and
coatless, and was flying down the water
front.
After the second shot Mrs. . Colson
dodged under Sedgwlck's pistol arm and
ran from the office, rapidly overtaking
Mrs. Hatch, who was attracting much at
tention by her screams. Patrolman Cros
by was attracted by the noise and entered
the freight office, where he found Seiig
wick sitting at his. desk as if nothing had
happened. Crabtree told the .officer what
had happened, and Crosby telephoned to
Captain Dunleavy of the harbor police.
Sergeant Ellis was detailed on the case
and he remained at theVallejo street of
fice until a warrant, sworn to by Doyle
before Police Judge Mogan, had arrived.
Sedgwick was taken to the harbor station,
and upon being released went to his rooms
at the St. Nicholas Hotel, where he re
fused to see callers.
Agent Sedgwick has been in the Val
lejo street omce about twelve years - and
was appointed there over Doyle, who has
been in the same office jor sixteen years.
Prior to his appointment Sedgwick had
been in politics for many years. An early
pioneer, he served as Sheriff In Tuolumne
County in 1859-60, and after that for fif
teen years was collector of internal reve
nue, being stationed in this city from
1S73 to 1S77. In 1880 he was Sheriff of this
county and afterward was superintend
ent of the House of Correction. He was
always accounted a faithful officer, who
knew not fear and who was a dead shot 1
with his pistol.
Thomas R. Doyle, who so narrowly es
caped death at the hands of this man,
savs that he is at a loss to account foi
the attack, unless it was due to tempor
ary insanity on the part of the old man,
who, he declares, must be about 79 years
of age.
"There has always been more or less
friction in the office," Baid Doyle yester
day afternoon, "due to the old man's
cranky ways. He has always been jeal.
ous of me, althouglf I cannot conceive
why. because even if he should be re.
moved there would be no chance for me
to get his place, as there are many men
in the service who would come before me.
"The. trouble this morning, however, was
due to another cause entirely. The old
man came in in a terrible temper. He had
a little quarrel with Mrs. Hatch and nhe
appealed to me for help. I told the old
man he ought to be ashamed to use such
language toward a woman. He cursed
mej^ien and I called" him a dirty "cur. I
saw him run to his drawer and thought
that he was-aftor a knife, for he always
kept one there. I was cornered and could
not get out. so I tried to shield, myself as
best I could behind the desk. He flred
three shots, and then I charged him with
a chair, stunning him so that he could
not use the pistol any further. Then I
went to the general offices and was ad.
viFed to swear out a warrant for him ana
not to allow him to re-enter the office."
C. \V. Crabtrce partially confirms the
story told by Doyle. He was the only eye
witness, or nt least he " claims to -have
been an eye-witness, although there Is a
strohgr suspicion that he was under his
desk during the time the bullets were fly
inc.
Â¦ Mrs. Hatch does not remember appeal
ing to'Doyle to take her part against th*
old man. "For nearly ten years T have
attended ' to Mr. Sedrwick's correspond
ence," she said, "and ne has always been
very kind to me. This morning he seems
to have been out of sorts and spoke : In
.in angry tone. If he used any violent
language to me I do not remember it, and
I ' do - not remember appealing to Mr.
Doyle. vl do not think that I did so. Wa
often had our little quarrels, but they
never'amounted to anything. It seemed
to me that Mr. Sedgwick 'was a. little bit
out of his head when he did what he dla
this morning. I did not see tbe shooting,
as I ran out of the office as eoon as I
saw Mr. Sedgwick go to his desk to-se
cure, as I supposed,- a knife with which
to attack' Mr. Doyle."

skin or elsewhere. - .
In accomplishing: this we do not
use mercury or other dangerous
drugs, and will wait for our pay till
the patient is satisfied that he is
sound and well. You should not en-
danger ytur health and life by tak-

from 81%c to 84%c, falling back to 82c and re

ulation. The weather in the NortlAvest con

ran as low as 75,000,000 bushels for the two
Dakotas and Minnesota. Minneapolis advanced
4%c. There â¢ was a good deal of .Â¦ realizing at
Chicago, but the market has taken everything
thus far." The belief â¢ that wheat will reach $1
per bushel Is still general. The only declines
during the day were caused by extensive real
izing and some foreign short selling. 'The pit

Nczi' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 21.â The stock market was
exceedingly lrresukÂ»r to-day ar.d the net results,
except In Â» few stocks, are not large, though
the extreme range of prices was very con-
EideraUe. Prices ruled above last night's clos
ing level for the greater part of the day and
when they approach^! last night's level the
market almtst Invariably fell Into extreme
dullness. That the demand which kept up
prices came very largely from the short' inter
est is highly probable. Some support was ac
corded by the pyir.pathetlc effect of the posi
tive firfnpth manifested by New Jersey Central
and Reactir.g rirpt preferrf-d. Northern Pacific
was conspicuously under pressure all day. Ef-
Torts were made to support the stock at about
M, but it broke through that prjee near nonn
and fell an extreme 1% to 4SVi. with
only a feeble rally. The renewed reports that
a <-rcp disaster was in prospect in the North
wÂ«-Â«t were resr-onpiblp for the weakness of this
Ftock and of Great Northern preferred, which
lost 4?i k points.
Some <5f the liquidation in Northern Pacific
was attributed to Berlin, where that stock is
a favorite and where money Â¦ difficulties are
forcing liquidation.- Speculative opinion was a
good deal confused with the cro^s currents of
the situation In China. th*> crop outlook, the
rational convention at Philadelphia and the
money market uutlook. Some- of the sellers of ;
Btocks yesterday vowed, their motive to be the
probability lhat Governor Roosevelt would re
(QM the nomination for the Vice Presidency
and as Governor would Insist upon the drastic
enforcement of the franchise tax law. Those
who !>old on th!e ground yeFterday naturally
covered their short contracts on to-day's de
velopments. London sold stocks in this mar
ket on the rumor of Admiral Seymour's i
<2*ath, but the local market wm lower before
this, tilling at advanced prices. Sub-Treasury
operations, including the payment for the gold
exported, have resulted in a loss of only $417,000
by the banks and to-day's debit balance by the
ffllil Tl'nwn I amounted to J879.607. The banks
have continue to receive money from the In
terior and the Saturday statement Is not likely :
to sho\\ a large decrease In cash, even If the
cold reported to be engaged for shipment on
t^atuTday Is not canceled. . The tone of the
laonev market here Is firmer, though not
quoifctly changed. ftcrjing exchange declined
3 Â« per cent, notwithstanding the advance In the
1/ondon discount rate. Sterling at Paris and
ls>-tltn is elso fell a fraction and Germany
1".us--!it g>ld timely from th* Hank of Kngland.
in fpile of a dfdinc in the Berlin discount rate.
Although the liank of -England has replenished
Its gold tapjAy during the week to the extent
of MUMBrCGB from interior sources, the private
ratÂ«> of <5lÂ«=eount in London continues to harden
lind hoiders have resorted to the bank during
the wtfk to the extent cf Â£450,CCa. The Eng
lish institution advanced its price for Us gold
I :.; Â¦<-â¢ H p^nny ajiJ for American <-ag!es >Â» penny
l*Â»-<lay. ir-cking 1 penny Jn Â«-ach ca.se for the
weelc. Although thÂ» Ptalement of the Dank
<;f France shows that institution materially
Â¦trcnirthencd. both by the Increase of bullion
and reduction of note issue and <>t loans, the
c-onUnu<vl downward course of fterline at Paris
inditfites further need of sold. The* pros-
IÂ»Â«"(-t is therefore tliat further demand will be
jr.atle for sol'lfroni New York, where the out-'
break cf s;*>eu!atU>ii in wheat and cotton is
makinz large additional use for mpney at in

The bond market was dull and Irregular.
Total tales, par value, $1,055,000.
United Statw second*, when Issued, declined
5>i in the bid price.
TliÂ»Â» weakest point about Great Northern was
its lack of support. The sellers of the stock
explained the weakness by the clock's high
price and byÂ» the reiwrts cf damage . to the
croj>s in Us territory. ; Money handlers said
that mÂ£Lny m*^rchan<1jae orders for goods had
bt-en <-ano<Â»ied by buy<-nÂ» In the Northwest and
they considered this as Indicating that the re

CHICAGO, June 21.â Wheat opened nervously,
July at SSgsS^ic and a rush of buying orders
sent the, market in a few minutes to 84%c.';Thls
was the high mark for the day and' of the >e T
cent phenomenal rise. The gloomy situation
In the Northwest was practically, unchanged.
Liverpool showed a good response to the rally
here yesterday. The Northwest, foreign in
terests andjieavy bulls were heavy buyers, and
despite reallzine sales on a large scale, the
market hunsr around the top for some time.
The bic advance at Minneapolis was also an
encouragement. The break there later in the

sert that they; have evidence implicating
him beyond any- question.
Mr. Rathbone's replies 'in the course of
the examination yesterday before Fourth
Assistant Postmaster General Bristow
and the Inspectors were regarded as very
unsatisfactory, more than establishing
the suspicions that have been forced upon
the investigators during the last few
weeks, until proof has accumulated to
such an extent as to compel them to look
upon Mr. Rathbone as guilty." ,
it Is also understood that the authorities
will ask for the extradition of the head
of the printing firm- at Muncie. Ind.,
which -sent bills on billheads other than
those of the firmâ billheads of a fictitious

he -. alleges, .that her indisposition was
acute melancholia, and in spite of his ef
forts to have her cured she became hope
lessly Insane. She Is now In an asylum In

OAKLAND, June 21.â The efforts of the
Alameda Bay District Fruit Growers' As
sociation to have apricot growers In Ala
meda County combine and sell their aprl
cots to the drier, and thus secure better
prices than have been offered by the Cali
fornia Canners' Association, have been
futile. At a meeting of the Fruit Grow
ers' Association held In Haywards this
evening the growers refused to combine.
This action was taken on motion of R.
Hlckmott. a, large grower and formerly
one of the reading canners of this State
The meeting was well attended and be
fore final action was taken there was a
heated discussion. E. K. Strowbrldge, R.
Hlckmott. B. Cary and several others
urged the growers to combine. Several
communications from San Jose driers
were read, giving the prices for which
green apricots could be dried. The mini
mum price was J9 70 per ton for green
fruit or $48 50 for fruit per dried ton. Fin
ally, when it became evident that the
growers would not combine, Chairman
Cary suggested that some motion be
made. K. Hlckmott moved that the
fruit-growers sell their fruit as best they
could and the motion carried unani
mously.
The canners' association has contracted
for three thousand tons of apricots in the
vicinity of this place, and the growers
with whom the association has contracted
are now fearful lest the canners will not
stand by their contract. The contracts
call for good, merchantable fruit, and the
association has given the growers notice
that the apricots must not only be mer
chantable but that they must also be un
blotcned and not cracked. This will ex
clude about one-third of the entire ton
nage already contracted for.
APRICOT GROWERS ARE
AT MERCY OF CANNERS

STAR CHAMBER
CHICAGO, June 2Lâ It rained heavily
this evening, and with the prospects of a
heavy track all the opinions regarding
the outcome of the American Derby,
which is to be run at Washington Park
Saturday, have had to be revised. How
ever, should there be clear weather to
morrow and Saturday there is still a
chance for a good and possibly even a
fast track. At present the handicappera
are basing calculations on a track that
will be somewhat muddy.
The conspicuous loser by this calcula
tion is Advance Guard, and the supporters
of the Shields colt are in mourning to
night. On the other hand, the thousands
of supporters of the favorite, Lieutenant
Gibson, are smiling, for until the Lieu
tenant scored his brilliant performance
on a hard track at Louisville this spring
the impression prevailed that he was
never at his best except on a heavy track.
The chances of James, Silver Garter,
Pupil and Sam Phillips are not thought
to be particularly affected one way or the
other by the mud. Sidney Lucas is a fine
mudder, and if any outsider is added. to
the present list of probable starters it is
likely to be he because of the muddy
track. Barrack's chances will be helped,
by the mud.
The sensation to-day was the race put
up by Norford at Harlem. There is al
ways a following here for "Lucky" Bald
win, because the latter has already won
four derbies; but .when his only candidate,
Norford, ran a poor race at Harlem on
Tuesday all but the credulous thought
Baldwin had no chance for this race* To
nearly everybody's surprise Norford
came out at Harlem to-day and won a
race by a city block, and as Norford 13 a
son of Emperor of Norfolk and therefore
a "mudder," the "Lucky" Baldwin colony
is in great spirits to-night. Should the
track be muddy on Saturday Norford will
have to be given consideration, although
the field which he beat to-day was not
much.
Lieutenant Gibson got another workout
to-day, and It was as usual sensational.
It occurred at Washington Park early
this morning, the son of G. W. Johnson
covering the mile and a half in 2:36^. It
was easily done and makes the colt more
than ever a favorite. Green Morris' pair.
Pupil and Silver Garter, were sent a mile
each, the former In 1:42 and the latter in
1:45. Pupil disappointed Morris, who says
Silver Garter will be his main reliance.
James was sent a "mile and a Quarter In
2:09J4 and pleased owner Barrick. Yellow
Tail worked only six furlongs and owner
Hackett. expressed himself doubtful
whether the colt would start on Saturday.
Advance Guard and All Gold were
brought over from Harlem and the former
was jogged a couple of miles.
"Lucky" Baldwin's Norford Makes a
' Splendid Showing at Harlem
and Will Be Accorded
Strong Support.

Surgeon General Wyman IMrects As

A telegram waÂ« received '. in this city
yesterday from Surgeon General Wyman
of the Marine Hospital Service at Wash
ington. D. C, td be forwarded to Assist
ant Surgeon Carmichael of the marlno
hospital service at Honolulu, directing,
that official to suspend all further quaran
tine against ships clearing from San Fran
cisco, The telegram in addition directs
Dr. Carmichael to cease the fumigation
of vessels hailing from this port.
The orders practically mean the raising
of the quarantine against San Francisco
by the Honolulu authorities. It is in fact
an admission by the Washington officials
that bubonic plage docs not exist In this
city. Traffic > between the two points,
which has suffered considerably owing to
the action of the local Board of Health in
declaring that" plague existed here, will
now be resumed with Its former activity:
DENVER, June 21.â Governor Thomas

Washington, has addressed a strenuous
protest against the quarantine to the Fed
eral Government. Governor â¢ Thomas will
consult the State Board of Health before
replying to Secretary Hay's Inquiry.

Negotiations for a Return Meeting
Between the Rival Middle-Weight
Boxers Nearly Completed.
The managers of the National Athletic
Club held a conference last night with
"Jack" Moffatt of Chicago and Al NeilL
It is almost a foregone conclusion these
men will meet in the ring again at Wood
ward's Pavilion. No definite agreement
was reached, but the parties in interest
are apparently of the opinion that there
is more potency in the names of these
men to attract a large attendance than in
any othÂ«r boxers now available. The club
has numed July 13 as the date of Its next
light. The matching of the hard-hitting
middle-weights wfll probably be effected
to-day.
Nein learned a bitter lesson In his last
engagement with MOffatt. He will leave
nothing undone that will put him in his
former condition, and hope* to regain the
pround he lost. He will spend a week at
the Vall^Jo Springs and two weeks at his
old training quarters. He will go in for
rougher work than usual, availing of the
services of two heavy-weights whom he
will huftle about. - Â¦â¢ â¢
Moffatt has looked after his health since
his laÂ« engagement and will require but
little work to put him on edge.

being driven by Charles Hansen.
In falling she released her hold on
the Infant and it rolled -under the
horse's hoofs. Naylor was stand
ing near by, and with rare pres
ence of mind he grabbed the horse
by the; bit with one hand,- while
with the other he reached down
and dragged' the child from under
the feet of the fractious animal..
After rescuing the ; Infant Nay

arid the animal started \ to- run

down. Several bystanders prompt

it from injuring Naylor and the
"baby," which he held In ' his arms.
Beyond a slight abrasion , of the

Hunting-ton, Hopkins & Co. Make
Application for a Dissolution dt
Copartnership.
Application was made yesterday In the
County Clerk's office to have the copart
nership heretofore existing between the
members of the old firm of Huntlngton,
Hopkins & Co. dissolved by mutual con
sent. The firm was organized in the early
sixties by Collls P. Huntington and Mark
Hopkins, and it did a thriving business by
selling hardware to the railroads which
were then in course of construction.
In 1SS8 a corporation was formed under
the same name, with Collis P. Hunting
ton. H. E. Huntington. W. R. S. Foye. G.
L. King and Charles Miller as directors.
In 1895. the good will and stock of the firm
which had been so successful were sold to
"Miller. Sloss & Scott, who have ; con
tinued the business since that time, t The
outstanding accounts and bills were re
tained by the corporation, and these hav
ing all been collected it was deemed ad
visable to wind up Its affairs. There were
10.439 shares of the capital stock repre
sented at the meeting when the arrange
ments for dissolution were perfected.
These were voted by, Messrs. Foye, H. E.
Huntington and.G. L. King. Collis P.
Huntington and Miller are now In New
York, but gave their consent to the dis
solution of the copartnership.
OLD FIRM WANTS TO
WIND UP ITS AFFAIRS
ed to the doors and a number could not
obtain seats. A pleasing feature of the
event was the large number of children
present with their parents.
There were eighteen numbers on the
programme and the recalls were frequent.
William J. Hynes sang and talked so' well
that he had to reappear four times, and
the audience wanted more. The dancing
(Scotch, Irish and Russian) was splendid,
particularly the sailors' hornpipe by little
Miriam Sydney Smith, a graceful fairy,
and the Irish jig and reel dancing by
O'Connor and Kelleher. Professor Louis
Tronchet and Mrs. Aline Hemof gave
some clever points In fencing. There was
club swinging by Xeil Lindsay and Adam
A. Ross manipulated the Scotch bagpipes
and Professor T. McCarthy the Irish.
Royal Chief John Ross presided. George
W. Paterson, the energetic secretary^ was
master of ceremonies, and with him on
the literary committee were George Miller
and Thoma3 Christy. The royal chief re
minded the large audience that the annual
games would come off at Shell Mound
Park on the Fourth of July.
THERE has been a genuine burst of
public enthusiasm over the heroic
deed of Fireman J. E. Sweeney, who
lost his life last Tuesday in effecting
the rescue of a helpless old man from a
burning building. The deepest sympathy
Is expressed for the struggling young
widow, who is fighting to keep the wolf
from the door, and the offers of assistance
for her little family' have been sponta
neous from every quarter. An act of hero
ism so unselfish has loosened the purse
strings of the public ' and the subscrip
tions are rolling in.
The managers of the several playhouses

Mrs. Almira S. Townsend was among
the first to respond yesterday to The Call's
appeal for funds. . She sent her. check for
$100, with a deep expression of sympathy
for the widow and children. Nine mem
bers of the Baccus family mailo up a purse
of $10, which was sent to The Call to be

Chief of Police Sullivan sent a letter yes
terday to the captain of each district re
ferring to the heroic act of the dead fire
man and suggesting that as a fireman's
duty was closely allied to that of a police
man in risking life the police should sub
scribe to the fund for the benefit of the
widow and children. He asked that his
letter be read to each of the watches,
with the proviso that all subscriptions

CAPTAIN KIRKMAN
BACK IN THE ARMY
Reappointment of the Officer Who
Was Court-Martialed and
w : v Dismissed.
Special Dispatch. to The CaJl. . . J . .
WASHINGTON. June 21.-Captain
George W. Kirkman, formerly major of
the Forty-ninth Volunteers and; captain
of the Twenty-third Regular Infantry,
who was dismissed from the army some
months ago, has been reappointed under
the . i*rovisions of a Joint resolution of
Congress, approved June 6. He has been
ordered to San Francisco for duty. Cap
,taln Kirkman while serving in the Phfl
ippineB was dismissed from the army un
der the proceedings of a court-martial,
approved by General Otis. He is now re*
Instated without losing his rank.
It is understood that immediately upon
his. 1 dismissal by General Otis, who as
commanding officer in the field in time of
war has supreme power, the friends of
Captain Kirkman brought most powerful
Influence to bear upon Congress to secure
his restoration to the army. It is said
these friends contended that while' Gen
eral Otis in time of war would nave had
full authority -Â¦ to dismiss Captain -Kirk
man In accordance with the finding- â¢ of
the court-martial, as a matter of fact
there was not a state of war in the Phil
ippines but merely an insurrection, and
that the Â¦ sentence r of - the court-martial
should have been submitted to < the Presi
dent for action thereon. .
It is understood. Captain Kirkman was
prepared to take the question of the le
gality Â¦ of his dismissal to the Supreme
Court. " The possibility of thia course, to
gether with the high standing and. great
influence of his friends, secured his rein
statement by Congressional legislation;
Two more vessels bound to the Pacific
Coast are making uiiusually long passages
and the chances are that heavy reinsur
ance will be paid on them within the
week.
The British four-masted bark Hillston
left Honolulu for Puget Sound on April
1 in ballast and nothing has been heard- of
her since. Over 1 a year ago the British
four-masted bark Dominion started on
the same voyage and nothing positive has
been - heard from her ' since. Seafaring
men are of the opinion that the Dominion
was driven north by a southwfsterand
went to pieces on the rock-bound coast of
Vancouver Island. Insurance men think
the T:Iillston has shared the fate of tho
Dominion and are very anxious in conse
quence.
The Chilean bark Calbuco left Iquique
with a cargo of nitrates "20!) days ago tor
Puget Sound and has not been heard
from since. The four-masted schooner
Americana Is now out 111 days from the
same port for San Francisco and 35 per
cent reinsurance Is being paid on her, so
the chances for the arrival of the Calbuco
are very small.
The Deckload Becord.
The handsome new . schooner Helene,
which completed her maiden voyage a
few* days ago, holds the record for the
largest deckload of lumber ever taken to
the Hawaiian Islands. She'was built on
the Sound and from Seattle took away a
general cargo in her hold, while on deck
there was piled 640,000 feet of lumber. She
is almost as good a sailer as she Is a
carrier and Captain Christiansen expects
to make a record trip in her before the
year is out.
Captain Christiansen, who Is part owner
as well as master of the Helene, 'has been
for twenty years in the Spreckels employ
and for nearly twelve years was master
of the brig John D. Spreckels. In that
vessel he made record runs to and from
the islands on numberless occasions and
now he intends to do equally as well on
the Helene.
The Helene is 205 feet long. 40 feet 6
inches broad and 15 feet deep. She carries
1800 tons of sugar or 1,250.01)0 feet of lum
ber. She was named after Miss Helene
Irwin, daughter of W. G. Irwin of Hono
lulu.
Sheep Blocked the Way.
The entire Market street system was
blocked at the ferries yesterday by a
band of sheep. The animals came down
the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
on the freight steamers and an attempt
was made to drive them in one band to
Butchertown. The poor brutes became
completely bewildered and made a de
termined stand around a Valencia street
car bound west and a Halght street car
bound east. Sheepherders, grlpmen, con>
ductors and all the small boys in the
neighborhood joined In the attempt to get
the animals across the track, but for
nearly an hour they ran around and
around in a ring and then reluctantly
broke away. In the meantime the Mar
ket street cars were stalled until the line
reached back to The Call building.
Brought the Piston Bx)d Ashore.
W. Beeman, lighthouse keeper at the
FaraUones, came to the city in an open
boat yesterday and will return homÂ»
again to-day. It took him eight hours to
sail in and he says the trip was" an en
joyable one. A piston rod of the engine
that operates the fog signal -broke and
Beeman brought it ashore for repairs.
Luckily there are two sets of engines on
the FaraUones so the warning to mariners
Is still sounded as usual.
German Ship Geier to Arrive.
' The Mayor received notice yesterday
from Governor Gage's private secretary
that the German warship Geier will leave
San Diego for San Francisco on August

â¢ Water Front Notes.
The British ship Inverlochy that left
here about four months ago for Europe
arrived at Liverpool yesterday. She was
caught iq some very heavy weather oft
the Horn and was considerably damaged.
Captain Johnston is still in command of
the British, ship Musselcrae and will re
main her master for many moons to come.
The Musselcrag was a long time getting
here owing to being damaged off the
Horn and ha\'lng to come here . via
the Cape of Good Hope. Some busy
body started the story that Captain
Johnston was to be removed on account
of the long 1 voyage, but there is not a
Â¦word of truth In the story. The owners
of the vessel tell the captain to continue
to handle the ship for their best interests
and they will be perfectly satisfied.
The British, ship Port Elgin, Captain
Frank Hand, â¢ docked at Green-street
wharf yesterday evening. The Port El
gin Is sixty days from Newcastle, N. S.
"W. This is Captain Hand's first visit to
San Francisco , since twelve years ago,
when he came on the ship Minnyhlve;
from Scotland. He reports that Frank
Armstrong, formerly the popular chief
officer of the Occidental and Oriental
Bteamship Belgic, is now chief officer of
the Medic, a mammoth steamship run

long time chief clerk to the general man
ager of the Denver and Rio Grande Rail
road, but left here on account of trouble
with his wife, Henrietta E. Pike. --â
Mrs. Pike was Indirectly the cause of
the killing of George R. Kroenlng by
William R. Peck In the Denver and Rio
Grande offices In 1895, and afterward
gained notoriety as a shoplifter and
burgltir.
She first attracted attention In June,
1S92, when she began suit in tfre District
Court against Mrs. Ella Smith and Mrs.
G. Parkhurst for- $50,000 damages for
slander. She was an Invited guest at a
function of the S. O. O. B.. a society com
posed of the . wives of Masons and,
Knights Templar, and claimed afterward
that the ladles had slandered her by
making statements concerning her ac
tions there. The suit was not pushed,
however, friends of the plaintiff advising
her to drop it. .
A few weeks - after the commencement
of the suit Pike and his wife were ar
rested on suspicion of being accomplices
of Mrs. Bessie K. Shaw In the firing of
the latter's residence on . Capitol Hill.
None of the charges against the parties
eral times since then Pike's persistency In
abusing the woman caused her to resort
to the law for protection, and Pike. was
notified that if he did not desist he would
be arrested and bound over to keep the
peace.
Mrs. Pike recently rented the house in
which she was killed and kep; roomers.
Charles Stone's Statement.
Charles F. Stone/ who was accused by
Pike of having brought on the trouble be
tween himself and wife,. denies emphatic
ally that he was guilty of any unseemly
conduct. Mr. Stope resides at 1074 Dolores
street. He is married and is employed by
the Bancroft-Whitney Company, law book
publishers. He was greatly surprised last
night- when the news of-the murder and
suicide was told him. , Without hesitation
he denied the charges made agalnst'hlm
by Pike. He said the' latter was nn-ab
sinthe fiend and was Insane, i He admitted
that lie knew- the murdered woman,- but
only as a friend. He said that Mrts. Pike
obtained a divorce- from . her husband
about a. year ago because of his drinking
habits and that since the divorce Pike had
bothered the woman considerably; that o;j
his advice Mrs. Pike visited the City Hall
and saw either Judge Hunt or Judge Con-

Pike created a big sensation by burglar

sojourning in Southern California. Sev
eral trunkloads of silverware, china sets,
valuable bric-a-brac, rugs, curtains, car
pets and other articles were stolen, and
ft was soon discovered that Mrs. Pike was
the thief. She confessed and most of the
goods were recovered. Friends interceded
for the woman and she was permitted to
go to San Francisco.'
"When Mrs. Pike returned several months
later, however, and opened a boarding
houso It was discovered that she was
using Mrs. Ives* property in her house

was arrested, but was never prosecuted

told last night what her relations with
the Pikes were In the following words:
"Pike was a fool. He had brains, but
absinthe got away with them. The child
Henrietta I hardly ever saw. If he said
in the letter he" left that I stolo her af
fections he lied, that's all. Mrs. Pike U3ed
to come to me and tell me that none or
her friends could come near the Jiouse,
her husband -was. so Insanely jealous of
man and woman. So he said I was partly
the cause of to-night's snooting, did he?
Well, that's.him all over. He was always
writing long letters about people. AV hen
he -was drunk he'd sit' down and reel em
off by the yard. All full of malicious
things about other people. '
"I haven't â¢â¢ seen him -for- four
years. I've been up in Healdsburg. I
only got back a short time ago I saw
Mrs. Pike three weeks ago. \Ve didnt
mention her husband. I m glad he s
dead. One fool less in the world. His
accusations are groundless. He was
crazy. I'm sorry for his wifer though.
I always thought he'd do something like
this." 'â¢ : " .
Henry D. Pike, Recently Divorced,
Chief Actor # in Horrible Double
Tragedy on ' Powell Street. .
Couple Who Figured in a Number of
Sensational Crimes and Episodes in
Denver, Come to Miserable End.
MEXIIT D. PIKE, bookkeeper for the
MWiiSamctte Paper Company of this
city, shot his divorced wife to
death and then put a bullet
through his brain In the apartments of
The woman at 732 Powell street about 8
o'clock last night. The shocking murder
and Fuioide wore deliberately planned and
as deliberately executed. The man -went
to the house with the avowed intention of
killing the woman, whom he claimed had
robbed his life of all happiness, and then
ending his own wretched existence.
He made threats so openly that the
woman was warned while he was yet on
his way to the house, but for some un
explained reason neglected to take precau
tions to prevent him from executing his
threats. Uefore the commission of the
crime the man and the woman he had
irarked for his victim quarreled so vio
lently that other occupants of the house
realizing that a tragedy was Impending
rushed from the place for assistance.
The pleadings of the 13-year-old adopted
daughter, whom Pike loved passionately,
alone prevented him from shooting the
woman the moment he entered the house.
Then, even while the police were hurry-
Ing to the scene, the man. with rase tear
ing at his heartstrings and curses flowing
from his lips, began his deadly work, not
to etop until both he and his victim were
dead an<5 the pretty little room where the
tragedy occurred had been transformed
Into a shamble.
Divorced a "Fear Ago.
Pike and his wife were divorced about
a year ago. Friends of the separated
couple claim that he threatened his ex
wife's life on many occasions, and within
an hour <ft the tragedy the woman re
ceived a warning before the crime last
night, which if heeded might have saved
her life.
In thÂ« early evening Pike had a con
versation with Alfred Roncovierl, the
well-known bandmaster. In which he in
quired about the disposition his ex-wife
Â¦was to make of their adopted child, and
then reiterated his intention of slaying^
her. When Mrs. Roncovieri heard of this
the Immediately notified Mrs. Pike by
telephone and cautioned her to keep the
<loor locked against the man.
'True to his word. Pike came to the
house. He did not request admittance,
but slipped up the stairway, as the door
was opened by some one passing out. In
Deputies Michael Brown and Thomas
Smith of the Coroner's office responded to
the call. They found that Pike had gone
to the house fully prepared to execute the
murderous threats he had made. In ad
dition to the revolver with which the dou
ble crime was committed another, fully
loaded, was found In his pocket. When
the body â¢was searched a letter to the
Coroner was discovered. It had been writ
ten shortly after 6 o'clock and the pen
manship was of the best. It detailed a
story of wrecked lives, whether true or
otherwise, and dragged the names of a
number of people into the case. All of
the accused deny the accusations and say
that the murderer and suicide was an ab
sinthe fiend and crazy. He claimed that
Mrs. Pike made threats against him and
that he would kill her only In self
defense. This is disputed by some of the
language In the letter as well as by the
fact that the woman was unarmed and
a weakling physically.
When the enraged man commenced to
Prepared to I>o Murder.
Mrs. Powell had telephoned to the Cal
ifornia-street police station for help and
Sergeant Duncan immediately dispatched
Officer J. Pearl to the place. .When the
policeman arrived the tragedy was over.
The little girl also, fearful that Pike
would not keep his promise not to harm
the woman, had slipped out of the house
to call for help. Those whom she sum
moned, like the police, arrived too late.
Three of the shots fired at the woman
had taken effect. One of them broke her
neck, another passed through her hand
and still another entered her head near
the left ear. He had reserved the fifth bul
let for himself. He had seated himself on
the floor, placed the muzzle of the revol
ver in his mouth and pulled the trigger.
The bullet passed out the. back of his
head. : .V'5
Too Late to Avert Trag-edy.
Less, than five minutes afterward W. F.
McKennay, a clerk, who occupied a room
in the same house, heard five shots. He,
!ike Mrs. Powell, had heard the angry al
tercation In the hallway, and arming him
self rushed to the door of Mrs. Pike's
room. The door was locked, but McKen
nay threw himself against it and it gave
way. As he entered the room the sight
that met his {raze chilled his blood. The
body of the unfortunate woman lay limp
and lifeless across a chair, while a few
feet away was the body of the murderer
In a sitting posture on the floor, his head
propped against a sofa, the bipod gushing
from his mouth and a smoking pistol still
grasped in his hand. Both the murderer
and his victim must have died almost In
stantly.
the hallway he met hJs ex-wife and the
adopted child Riethe, a girl 13 years of
age. He displayed a revolver and a quar
rel immediately ensued. Suddenly Pike
broke away and rushed about the halls
trying- the doors of a.11 the rooms.
"Is she in these rooms?" he was heard
to say.- 4
The little girl tried to pacify him and
begged him not to shoot. On his bended
knee he embraced the child and swore
that he would not harm her.
"Don't kill mother either," the child
begged.
Pike finally took an oath that he would
not.
Mrs. Pike then asked him to put the pun
away and come into her room, that they
might talk in peace. He did as requested
and the door was locked after them.
Mrs. H. C. Powell, who has apartments
in the same house, heard the dispute and
locked the door of her room. She says
she knew that trouble was imminent, and
rushing down a rear stairwav reached a
grocery store, from which she telephoned
to Mrs. Pike and aFked her if she needed
'assistance. She offered to send for the
police, and Mrs. Pike told her that she
thought it best to do so. After the woman
had placed the receiver back on the tele
phone Instrument she returned to the
room where her ex-husband was waiting
and again the door was locked behind her.
Pike was formerly secretary to the pres
ident of the Rto Grande Railway. He
drank heavily and soon lost his position.
Twelve years ago he married Miss Hen
rietta Carter, a sister of Emma Ray", the
wife of Johnny Ray. the actor, and also
a sister to Lillian Sherwood (Thomas), a
variety actress at Spokane.
The union was childless and the couple
adopted the little girl, who now figures
so prominently in the tragedy, in Denver,
Colo., in September, 1SS2. Before Pike
and his wife left Colorado their, domestic
infelicity began. He drank heavily and
went rapidly from bad to worse. Finally
they came West and located In this city.
He at first secured a position with the
Southern Pacific Railroad and later be
came an expert accountant. Ho was last
employed by the Willamette Paper Com
pany, of which William Pierce Johnson,
mentioned In the letter to the Coroner, is
the president. J 'Â¦
About three years ago Mrs. Pike was
forced to leave her husband. He drank
absinthe and abused her. He claimed,
despite his ill treatment, to still retain his
old affection for her, and on three differ
ent occasions a reconciliation was effect
ed. About one year ago, however, Mrs.
Pike was forced to appeafr to the courts
for an annulment of their marriage con
tract, and a decree was granted her. Sev-

pull the trigger of the revolver the woman
evidently sought to save herself by leap
ing from a window. This was made mani
fest by the bloodstains on the glass. The
window was locked and before she had a
chance to escape the bullets brought her
down. All the shots entered the back,
and the wound In the hand was received
probably when the woman raised that
member to protect herself. â,,,-,
Mrs. A. Roncovleri and Mrs. M. J. Ba
rabas, who are intimate with the family,
claim that for a lone time Pike hnd been
persecuting his ex-wife. She was divorced
from him about a year ago and the
ground on which the separation was
granted was cruelty. Since that time Pike
had made many threats against the
woman and both of the women above
mentioned always tried to notify her by
telephone when he threatened to visit her.
Mrs. Pike, it is said, came to regard the
man's threats with contempt, and stated
that they caused her no apprehension, as
she believed him to be too much of a
coward to take human life. The womfn
say that Pike had said he would go to
Chicago last Monday. When he dlil not
go Mrs. Pike was warned. They also. In

much worry, and that many disputes be
