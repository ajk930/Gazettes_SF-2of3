INSTRUCTIONS TO
CHAFFEE PREPARED
WASHINGTON, June 23. â Secretary
Root devoted the afternoon to the prepar
ation of instructions to Brigadier General
Chaffee, who has been assigned to the
; command of the troops ordered to China,
and after a conference the President ap
proved \ them with only a few verbal
changes, which -did not alter their gen
eral character. Although Secretary Root
would not make public the text of the
Chaffee instructions he said that gener
ally, speaking General Chaffee had been
ordered to look out for the. lnterest of the
United States in, China, to avoid en
tangling alliances, to. act concurrently
with the other foreign powers where It
; was to the general Interest to do so and.
In' a word, to continue the policy that has
'marked" the actions of the United States
.'slnce.the beginning of the Boxer troubles
In China. These instructions will be tele
graphed to General Chaffee at San Fran
cisco .in . order to reach \ him . before the
departure of the Grant on Sunday even-
Ing. Secretary Root said that In case the
progress of events made It necessary It
would be an easy matter, to modlf y. Gen
eral "Chaff cc's Instructions' by 'cable' to
Nagasaki, which would be the first port
visited i by the Grant' after her departure
from San Francisco.
Secretary Root was asked If any more
troops would be ordered to China and he
replied, "Not yet." but intimated that the
"further action of the War Department In
that matter would be governed entirely by
the exigencies of the situation. To-day's
instructions are supplementary to his
original orders "to proceed to Peking by
way of Nagasaki tin d Taku."
GERMANY PREPARING
FOR A LONG CAMPAIGN
BERLIN, June 29.â 1t Is evident that the
German Government expects the disturb

asmuch as all volunteers Joining the. naval
battalions for China have been pledged for
service until the autumn of 190 L The ex
pedition will take 2200 tents, each to serve
for two men.
Bishop Anzer, the German missionary
Bishop at - Shantung, who has been in
Europe for several months, will leave Ber
lin in a few days to rejoin his mission, go
ing by way of the United States. Consid
erable comment has been caused by the
failure of. Emperor, William to grant him
an audience during this vfsit. which is said
to be. due to the, fact that the Bishop's
.views do not coincide with the Emperor's.
PREPAREDNESS OF NAVY
FOR ANY EMERGENCY
WASHINGTON. June 23.â A sign of the
preparedness of the navy for any emer
gency that may, arise in the East Is ex
hibited in the alacrity with which Admiral
Bradford, chief of the equipment bureau,
has taken steps to maintain an ample sup
ply of coal In 'readiness at convenient
points for naval use. " Almost before, there
were any general misgivings as to the. re
sult of the Boxer movement In China the
equipment bureau was looking over the
colliers purchased . in the Spanish-Ameri
can war and since lying out of commis
sion at the navy, yards, with a view to
loading them up at once for foreign ser
vice. Steps have been taken to anticipate
the arrival cf these ships in Chinese
waters by diverting nearer cargoes of coal
to Admiral Kenny's support.
The Navy Department to-day received
news of the arrival at Singapore of the
Ataka, with 6000 tons aboard. She ia from
Norfolk for Manila and put Into Singapore
for orders. She will probably be diverted
to Taku, carrying her cargo to Admiral

Unlucky -Vessels.
The Zealandla brings the news that the
Ohio was not the only . vessel to reach
Nome with smallpox aboard. There were
two cases on the Roanoke and one on the
Santa Ana. all of which went north from
Puget Sound. The vessels and their pas
sengers were sent to Egg Island, where
they were still in quarantine when the
iZealandla sailed.
The barge Falkenberg, which started
,for Nome in. tow of a Sound steamer, was
abandoned at sea. Later she was picked
up by the steamer Lakme and towed to
Nome, where both vessel and cargo wero
sold by the agents of the steamer.
The barkentine 'Catherine Sudden and
her cargo were sold by the agents of the
steamer Corwin. Vessel and cargo will
be a total loss to the owners, as a genera
tion of litigation would not get them back
a cent. Might is right at Nome, and the
man with the gun carries the aay.
The transport Rosecrans that was re
ported by the Portland as ashore on a
mud flat was towed off by the tug Meteor

he died the following day.
The other shooting scrape occurred in
a saloon. A stranger in Nome, who had

Kansas City to-day. Mr. Williams has
been among those mentioned as a pos

says that having pronounced^views and
not being afraid to express them makes it
impossible for him to be considered in this
connection. He is by far the most breezy
and unreserved man that has yet appeared
here and he talks on every phase of the
situation, without, however, committing
himself or the New England delegates
upon the Vice Presidential situation, save
to say that he believes that Towne would
be the strongest man that could be named
with Bryan. Mr. Williams talked about
ex-Senator Hill in a manner to indicate
his entire disapprobation of that gentle
man.
"What is Hill coming for?" he asked
and answered the query: "For the sole and
avowed purpose of trying to secure a
modification of the platform of 1896. He
ought to be here in sackcloth and ashes,
instead of trying to tell us what we should
do. New York as well as Hill remained
silent in the Chicago convention after the
majority had declared Its will on'the plat
form. Now he comes here to say, 'I'll
help you if you do as I say.v if we win
he will say. 'I helped you.' If we lose he
will say. 'I told you what to do and you
see the result." I don't like that attitude.
Croker and Murphy come here In a dif
ferent spirit, willing to take the platform
that is made and abide by the result. It
is likely that Hill will not be so prominent
when Croker and Murphy take charge."
Mr. Williams Is one of the men who Is
determined to work for a specific declara
tion for the ratio of 16 to 1 in the platform.
He says that there must be no deviation
from that declaration. ,
"If we were right in JS96 why should
we change 'now? To simply reaffirm the
Chicago platform Is. not sufficient. Nor
would it be enough to declare. for bi
metallism. Every man '- could declare
himself a bimetallist and place a ratio at
22 to 1 or 50 to 1, to suit his own ideas, all
of which would mean nothing., I do not
believe this convention will be satisfied
with anything but a specific 16-to-l decla
ration. The morale of the party de
mands it and If we were right when we
polled six and a a half millions of votes
we will be right In making the declaration
anew. Mr. Bryan could not honorably
stand upon a platform that even by im
plication abandoned' the great Issue on
which the former campaign was fought.
We cannot write ourselves down as hay-
ing been jackasses or knaves In 1596 by
leaving out the ratio declaration."
Along this vein did Mr. Williams discuss
the issue and presently he turned his at
tention to Grover Cleveland, who he de
nounced for throwing the weight of the
Democratic administration against the
party four years ago. - Â¦
"To make concessions now." he said,
"would mean that Cleveland was right
and the greatest American In the Demo
cratic party. Ido not believe this con
vention will do it and when the delegates
arrive it will be found that the movement
is not popular; The men behind this
movement are thope who want to place
the Democratic party and Mr. Bryan in a
vacillating position like the present admin
istration. They want to place Bryan on
a par with McKinley and I say the Kan
sas City convention will not do anything
of that kind."
TO MAKE IMPERIALISM
THE PREDOMINANT ISSUE
Silver Eepuhlican Leader Says Free
Coinage Will Be Placed in the
Background.
KANSAS CITY, June 29.â General E. S.
Corser, secretary of the Silver Repub
lican National Committee, gave out a
statement to-day in regard to the prob
able action of the Sliver Republican Con
vention, and. Incidentally, a prophecy of
the lines on which the coming campafgn
will be fought. He believes that the is
sue of free silver at 16 to 1 will be and
ought to be subordinated to the more
pressing question of imperialism or anti
imperialism. .
"There Is not the slightest danger,"
General Corser said, "that the free sil
ver issue will be discredited. We stand
on that just a? we did in ISP6. But all
Intelligent blmetallists are agreed that It
cannot be made the great absorbing ques
tion In this campaign because, the legisla
tion of the last Congress has placed it
beyond immediate settlement. On the
other hand the question of a republic or
an empire Is one which is to be settled
at oneo â now and" forever. Four/ more
years of McKinley and ' Hanna .would
place that, too, beyond the power/of th&
Democratic party to settle. The silver
question is a great question, but is one
which the future can settle. If In the
next four years the gold standard proves
a good thing we don't want a change,
but If. as we believe, it will prove a bad
thing It will prove its own, undoing an*
will demand a change.
"Mr. Bryan's declaration that there are
three great issues in this campaignâ free
silver, imperialism and the trusts â is em
inently correct, but of necessity one of
the three will take pre-emlnance and that
will be imperialism."
Charles A. Towne will arrive to-morrow
and In conference with General Corser
and members of the committee will com
plete the preliminary arrangements for
the Silver Republican Convention.
Boomers of. Sulzer and Towne Are
Making the Most Noise
Thus Far.
KANSAS CITY, June 29.â The "running
mate" problem Is as conspicuous as It was
at Philadelphia, and at this distance the
guessing is fully as indiscriminate. There
are plenty of candidates, men who want
the honor, and one does not hear so much
about declinations as- there was among
the Republicans. The aggressive men are
Sulzer of New York and Towne of Minne
sota, while the names In the background
form: a basis of speculation, there being
such merr as Benjamin F. Shiveley of In
diana- and Judge a." B. Parker of New
York, who- are considered as available.
The belief Is general that some kind of an
indorsement from Colonel Bryan would be
sufficient to name the candidate, but it
Â¦will be a bold man who will dare to pro
claim that any one particular candidate
Is the*. choice of the man already deter
mined upon for President.
There are not enough delegates here to
give even an intimation of what is likely
to occur. Dispatches received here from
different sections Indicate that the dele
gates who have been sounded on the ques
tion have not yet made up their minds, or
they do not care to express a preference
for any candidate. There Is an impression
that the good politics of the 'situation
would mean the selection of a man from
New York, and If a satisfactory candidate
cannot be found there the next best thing
to do would be to go to Indiana.
Western Democrats would be glad to
have an Eastern man named who would
add strength to the ticket in that section.
Both New York and Indiana are consid
ered battlegrounds. Both were carried for
McKinley in IS9G, but the confidence of the
Democrats in their ability to reverse the
vote In Indiana and the strong hopes they
entertain of carrying New York are inter
esting features of the situation here. It
is because of this condition that^he Dem
ocrats talk of a Vice Presidential candi
date from one of those States. There will
have to be more delegates In the city and
something like an alignment of forces for
and against certain candidates for Vice
President before even guesses can be made
with any degree of Intelligence.
If Mr. Sulzer of New York be not nom
inated for Vice President it will not be on
account of any lack of booming on the
part of his friends who are here. The
managers, with B. D. (TTJonnell at their
head, are losing no opportunity of mak
ing known the fact that Mr. Sulzer Is not
only in the race, but that he will win if he
can. Badges beating the wqrdp "Bryan
and Sulzer and Victory." with portraits of
the men.' are being distributed to all who
Â¦will wear them, while another method of
campaign has been adopted in spreading
broadcast a small handbill. This docu-
PLENTY OF CANDIDATES
FOR VICE PRESIDENCY
ment contains only a few words, and
quotes a speech made by Champ Clark In
the House of Representatives, in which
the Missouri man said:
"In this distinguished presence I nom
inate for Vice President William Sulzer
of New York, who is faithful to the cause
at all times, in all places and under all
circumstances. I honor Mr. Sulzer for; his
courage, his honesty and his fidelity ex
hibited amid environments which would
discourage, dishearten and appall a more
timid man."
vAn interview with Mr. Sulzer, tele
graphed from Lincoln and published here,
quotes him as saying that he stood with
Bryan on the Boer question and every
other question. He also declared that the
New York delegation would do whatever
was best for the party, and if the con
vention wanted 16 to i the delegation
would not oppose it.
FAVORS AN EVASION
OF THE SILVER ISSUE
Chairman Jones Declares a Specific
Sixteen-to-One Declaration
Unnecessary.
KANSAS CITY. June 2JÂ».â Senator Jones
of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, arrived in Kansas
City to-night and in a brief interview
stated that he did not think a specific 16
to 1 silver declaration was necessary if
the Chicago platform were adopted. He
was asked the direct question If a specific
declaration would be made If the Chicago
platform were adopted, and' replied with
a question:
"Would not the reafflrmation of the Chi
cago platform be a declaration in favor
of 16 to 1? I think It would be."
He then added, with deliberation: "I
don't think anything will be adopted by
the eonvetnlon that will be a deviation bo
much as the breadth of a hair from the
principles laid down in the Chicago plat
form. A reaffirmation of that platform
will mean the adoption of every word and
letter In It, including tne 16 to 1 declara
tion. I don't believe that a reiteration of
that plank, or any other. Is necessary to
make plain our position. If it is necessary
to restate the 16 to 1 provision it would be
equally necessary to restate that relating
to the Supreme Court, government by in
junction, the revenue tax and every other
provision, for if we should single gut one
provision only and specify it, there might
be a claim that we did not mean to indorse
the other features in reaffirming the Chi
cago platform. If the convention readopts
the Chicago platform it will mean that
every syllable is adopted. I don't kno\^
just what form the indorsement will take,
but It will mean everything It says."
Just at this point some one broke in with
a question as to whether or not persons
who did not support the Chicago platform
could support the Kansas City platform
if It should reaffirm the former.
"I'm not- the keeper of the consciences
of such people and cannot tell what they
can do," replied Senator Jones. \
The Senator said he did not know
whether Mr. Bryan was coming to Kan
sas City, and he did not expect to go to
Lincoln for the present. When asked con
cerning the Vice Presidency, he replied
that he did not know -who would be nom
inated and had no intimation as' to the
favorite. The matter of temporary- chair
man would, he said, be considered at the
meeting of the committee. To a question
concerning the chairmanship of the na
tional committee he returned an answer
indicating that he did not wish to discuss
the matter.
Ex-Senator Fred T. Dubols of Idaho and
ex-Representative Charles S. Hartman of
Montana arrived to-night and joined the
silver Republican and Populist boomers,
who are urging C. A. Towne for Vice
President.
Officers of the Convention.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. June 29.âThe.se
lection of presiding officers of the "con
vention has not yet been determined. The
National Committee will prepare the
name of the temporary chairman, who
will no doubt be indorsed by the conven
tion. So far as possible the committee
will also arrange for the permanent chair
man,-and available' men for that place
will be canvassed at the first meeting.
Mayor D. A. Rose of Milwaukee and
Charles S. Â¦ Thomas of Colorado have been
suggested for temporary chairman, and it
is expected that one of them will be
chosen.' Representative James D. Rich
ardson of Tennessee has been suggested
for permanent chairman. Mr. Richard

a portion of the Chicago convention, when
Senator White's voice failed.

Special Dispatch to' The Call.
LINCOLN, Nebr., June 20.â Nebraska
Democrats close to Bryan place no cre
dence In press telegrams sent from this
city last night to the effect- that Bryan
had announced finally he would not go to
Kansas City. Chairman Hall of the Dem
ocratic State Committee said to-night:
"It Is within my personal knowledge
that Mr. Bryan made no such assertion.
He will certainly not go there before the
convention, and It Is -even his desire to
stay within the quiet wf his home; but I
have every reason to believe if the con
vention, after he be nominated, send word
that hiÂ» presence is desirable In KanÂ«aj
City he will bow to Its will."
Chairman Hall speaks the sentiments of
other Democratic leaders In the Mate.
Among these are several who have gone
about privately arranging for a special
train to be engaged here at short notice
to carry the Democratic leader to Kansas
City if he be expected to address the con
vention.
The feature of Bryan's afternoon was a
visit from a delegation representing 'the
Bryan Traveling Men's Club of Lincoln.
The delegation presented him with a fe
dora hat and a silk umbrella and assured
him the club would, be represented in the
parade at Kansas City by k 2ZO uniformed
members.
Two accredited aspirants for the Demo
cratic Vice Presidential nominationâCon
gressman Wiliam Sulzer of New York and
ex-Congressman J. Hamilton Lewis of
Washingtonâ vied with each other to-day
at winning the favor of William J. Bryan,
at whose home both were guests. Sulzer
arrived early this morning In company
with Editor Fiegel of the Tammany Times.
An hour's conference followed at Bryan's
home, but at its conclusion neither gentle
man would discuss what passed between
them. The Washington man came to the
ctty later. He had no trouble In obtaining
a conference with the Democratic leader,
but its result is surrounded by as much
doubt as that of Sulzer. Bryan was
painfully silent when approached on the
subject, but friends rieclare neither the
New Yorker nor the Washington gentle
man secured any semblance of a pledge
of the Nebraskan's aid at Kansas City
Bryan, they say, has absolutely kept aloof
from the Vice Pfesidency question and
will maintain his determination.
This afternoon Bryan took his guest 3.
accompanied by a squad of Kastern news
paper correspondents who came during
the day, out to his farm. Here he display
ed recently harvested wheat, growing
corn, oats and garden truck and chickens
Richard Croker and ex-Senator Edward
Murphy are expected to arrive to-morrow
to confer with Bryan, although no definite
announcement has come from the New
Yorkers that they are actually comln? to
Lincoln. Bryan himself, knows nothing
further on the subject than what has been
stated by press dispatches.
An Incident of Sulzer's trip from. New
York was the painful smashing: of his
right thumb, the result of a sudden de
scent of a car window. He had the thumb
dressed immediately after arriving here.
the surgeon stating, however, that fur
ther"* delaying of medical attention tnlg^.t
have caused tetanus. Sulzer will continue
his Journey to Kansas City to-morrow,
but the injured thumb will compel him to
taboo handshaking in furthering bis
boom.
Plans of the Silver Republicans.
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. June 25.â The pro
gramme of the Silver Republicans will be
mapped out to-morrow, when Chairman
Towne of their National Committee ar
rix-es. It is expected that Senator Teller
of Colorado will be temporary chairman,
and that L. W. Brown of Onto will be
permanent chairman. Bryan will be nom
inated for President on the day he lÂ»
nominated by the Democrats. The Silver
Republicans would like to name Towne
for Vice President, but if tho Democratic
convention should choose another candi
date it is quite possible that the choice
win be ratified by the Silver Republicans.

The braves of the Irbquois Democratic
Clob escorted the California delegation
en route to Kansas City to the Oakland
mole yesterday morning. As the train
pulled out the club was presented with an
American flag. Last night the club held
its regular weekly meeting and discussed
much important business. President Wil

*t he member? had prepared on the "Prin

handed in to the secretary and will be
turned over for judgment to the following
literary committee: Charles nildea. Rob

A. Jacobs. A. D. Lemon and C. W. Moores.
The results will probably be announced
next week.
A lively debate ensued when Chairman
W. H. Alford of the joint State and Cuun
ty Committee af=ke-d the ratification com
mittee of the Iroquois to postpone their
meeting, set for Wednesday, July 6. to
Saturday. July 7. He said ji- was absurd
to hold a ratification meeting on the night
of tbe first day of the convention, as the
candidates would not probably he nom

argument the club decided to hold two
meetings â one on Wednesday on their own
account and another on Saturday in con
junction with the Stat" and County Dem
ocratf. Metropolitan Temple is selected as
the place where both meetings will be
held.
A vote of thanks was tendered to W.

TALK OF NOMINATING
BRYAN ON THE FOURTH

. ICANSAS CITT. M0.. -June 29.â A story
has .been in circulation indicating that
plans have already been perfected to
rjominate Bryan on July 4. even Jf the
other business of the convention, such
as permanent organization, report of the
committee on credentials and even the
platform should have to be postponed.
I"he few delegates now here do not take
Â«indly to the suKjeestlon and say that the
ronvention should proceed in the 'usua!
srder. While there is a sentiment in mak-
IROQUOIS PREPARES
TO INDORSE BRYAN
ing the nomination on the Fourth it is
thought -it would be. carrying sentiment
too far. There are a number of contests
which must be decided and it will not be
poFFible to settle on the platform without
some consideration. It would be decidedly
unusunl to make the Presidential nomina
tion the day the convention met and It
might result in scattering the delegates
and crowds, who would not care to remain
after the Presidential nomination was
made.
' The most elaborate decorations for State
headquarters that have been seen at any

pictures of Colonel Bryan, hut one in par

people wanted the missionaries to let them
have their, guns so they, could fight the
robbers. The missionaries declined on the
ground' that the treaty ' forbade such a
course. The robbers belonged to a soci
ety known by the name of "Lol." They
are: supposed to be an offshoot of tho
Boxers. â¢ , .
In his -letter Dr. Vandenburg says:
"Lately the thieves Just below here have
been robbing and pillaging, and they took

fifteen miles, from here and held him un

collier Caesar to proceed to China. -She

ferred to thÂ«Â» vessels of * Admiral Remey's

"but, lt seems to me that the powers
should without delay take possession of
the "Woo Sung forts and U>e warships be
longing to China lying in the harbor. The
Woo Sung forts are five miles below
Shanghai.' and if 4t becomes necessary to
drive their garrison out the Chinese sol
diers will retreat through the city, mur
dering and looting foreigners. You per

Shanghai in large numbers, and this is a
pretty good indication of what may hap
pen. - During the Franco-Chinese war,
though the French did not attack the Woo
Sung forts, it was expected they would do
so, and every night our men-of-war were
prepared to defend the American settle
ment in case of attack by the Chinese.".
A naval- officer who saw service in the
East , during the Franco-Chinese war
called attention to-day to the reports that
the Chinese are mounting additional guns
on the Woo Sung forts and are collecting
a fleet In Shanghai harbor.
Such action is necessary In view of the
Ignorance which prevails with respect to
the fate of the Ministers and to the neces
sity of relieving them without further de
lay If they are held prisoners in Peking.
If they are in the possession of the Chi
nese as hostages then the powers can only
hope to rescue them by seizing the persona
of the Empress Dowager and Emperor
and compelling them to take measures for
their relief.
There seems 10 be the greatest ignorance
in official and diplomatic circles regarding
the movement of the allied, column, and
it is not known here whether It has start
ed, though It is believed, in view of the
failure of Vice Admiral Seymour's expedi
tion, that it will proceed Immediately to
the capital.
The troops that will be "sent in future
to China will, of course, be in the nature
of reinforcements, as by the time the
American regiments arrive the allied
forces Â¦will probably be well on their way
to Peking.
He will then proceed to Taku. But this Is
a question of naval detail which is causing
the authorities no concern whatever. Un
der the understanding from General Mac-
Arthur's dispatches the inexpediency of
further reducing the American force In
the Philippines, unless additional troops
are Immediately sent to replace those
withdrawn; the War Department is now
considering what troops serving in the
United States can best be spared for ser
vice either in the Philippines or China,
probably the former. Two regiments will
be relieved from service in Cuba within a
few weeks, and they will be ordered to the
United States to take the place of troops
which will be sent to the East. The
Ninth Cavalry and Fifteenth Infantry are
spoken of for service in the Philippines,
and it is also said that the artillery branch
may be drawn upon to supply troops to
act as infantry.
MINISTERS DEAD OR
HELD AS HOSTAGES
Powers May Find it Necessary to Seize the
Persons of the Empress Dowager and
Emperor â Admiral Remey to Succeed
Kempff, Whose Actions Are Not Satis-
Special Dispatch to the Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, June 22.â Pessimism has re
placed the optimism which pre
vailed yesterday in official circles
in reference to, the foreign lega
tions in China. It is generally conceded
to-day that the - foreign Ministers are
either dead or held as hostages, though
there is one shred of hope to which the
President is clingingâ that the foreigners
in Peking have been assigned to a. well
defined position inside of the forbidden
city of the capital, and the Imperial
troops are aiding the foreign guards in
protecting them. This possibility Is re
garded as a slim one, especially .in view
of the dispatch received by Minister Wu
from the Tsung-LI-Yamen stating that
they (the legations) were to leave in a
short time with their guards for Tientsin.
Dispatches from native sources are ac
cepted with reserve* by the officials in
view of the fact that they have persist
ently stated that the foreign Ministers
were with Vice Admiral Seymour's col
umn, when it is now known that the re
lieving force has heard nothing of the
Ministers or. their fate.
Notwithstanding the character of the
news received to-day from Rear Ad
miral Kempff. the President, unlike the
members of his Cabinet, has left Wash
ington, hoping that when the darkness
shrouding China lifts the Ministers and
their staffs will be found alive and well
under the protection of the Imperial Gov
ernment. The President frankly states
that he has no information upon which
to base this hope, but he cannot under
stand how 700 foreigners could be mur
dered without Information in some way
reaching the civilized world. '
Members of the Cabinet who discussed
the situation after the Cabinet meeting
expressed the greatest anxiety over tne
situation and especially over the Minis
ters. Their anxiety is due to the dlspatcn
received by Secretary Long this morn-
Ing from Rear Admiral Kempff. A dis
patch a, few days ago â¢ from Admiral
Kempff stated: "The Peking force and
foreign Ministers are reported with thk
Peking relief expedition."
It Is no longer a secret in naval. circles
that the Navy Department is not alto,
gether satisfied with the manner in which
Admiral Kempff has been handling af
fairs, and especially in reporting details
to Washington. Though some days have,
elapsed since the casualties In MajoÂ»*
Waller's command occurred he has falleC
to cable to Washington the names. of the
marines killed and wounded. Instru^
tions to do so were cabled htm to-day.
Why he did not participate in the bom
bardment of the Taku forts Is a ques
tion that the authorities have been ask
ing since that event occurred.
It Is understood that under the instruc
tions cabled him Rear Admiral Remey
.will upon - arriving at , Taku within the
next . ten Â¦ days investigate Admiral
Kempff's conduct, and the latter will prob
ably be ordered to Manila to take charge
of affairs there. Admiral Remey.wlth the

Kuling Is a mountain town, forty-flve
miles up the Yangtse River and fifteen
miles from the river. The steamers on
the Yangtse are run by foreigners, but
there are Chinese forts all along the
river, and If trouble should extend down
to that region the missionaries at Kuling
would be cut off from the civilized world
entirely. The Morris referred to is Rev.
Dr. Morris. He Is supposed to be at

WASHINGTON, June 29. â The Ivavy Department this morning received the following
cablegram from Admiral Kempff:
"CHEFU, June 29. â Secretary of the Navy: Peking relief expedition now in Tientsin with
200 sick and wounded. Ministers and Peking party not with them. No news from them."
LOXDOX. June 30, 4a. m.â There is absolutely no authentic word as to the whereabouts of the members of the le
gation, although abundant reports from Chinese sources say that they wtre safe a few days ago. The Daily Mall's
Shanghai correspondent, telegraphing yesterday, says:
"An imperial decree has been sent to all the Viceroys advising them that the foreign Ministers were safo
In Peking on Jure 23 and affirmh.g that the Government would protect them. That is authentic and reliable. I
received it through a high Chinese official having means of communication from the capital to Shanghai by courier to
Pao Tir.g Fu and thence by telegraph. There is no doubt that the Chinese Government fully recognizes what the safety
of the Ministers Impjies at the present time and for this reason there is less uneasiness about them."
The Shanghai correspondent of the Daily Express, under yesterday's date, says:
"Chinese officials declare that they have imperial authority for stating that the foreign Ministers left Peking for Tien
tsin, via Pao Ting Fu. on June 26. They had passports and were escorted by a strong body of Chinese troops. It is
Impossible to verify this statement and the Consuls here are not disposed t,o place much faith In It. Jung Lv, former
generalissimo of the Chinese forces, who was dismissed by the Empress Dowager when she designated Pu Chun as
heir apparent to the throne, has promulgated an order to all Viceroys and Governors not to obey imperial edicts is
sued since June 16. This is interpreted to mean another coup d'etat is foreshadowed, and it is believed that a new Em
peror will be proclaimed."
The Canton correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, in a dispatch dated Thursday, says:
"The unexpected arrival of an edict late last night from the Emperor and Empress Dowager the de
parture of Li Hung Chang northward on the United States steamer Brooklyn. Arrangements for his sailing had been
quietly completed by United States Consul Robert M. Me Wade and Commander McLean of the Don Juan de Austria
The possibility of a rebellion in Canton and the imperative necessity of the organization of a properly armed and re
liable corps of 10.000 men are among the chief reasons for the edict detaining Earl Li. One hundred and thirty pirates anu
Boxers were t-eheaded yesterday by Lis order to terrorize law-breakers. The United States steamer Princeton has been
ordered to Canton."
A dispatch from Shanghai of yesterday's date says the position at Chung Kfng is very critical and that the steamer
Pioneer has been, detained.
The adventures of the hard fighting allies under Admiral Seymourâ their reaching Anting, twelve miles from Peking,
the decision to retreat, the capture of rice and immp^se stores of modern arms and ammunition, affording material for a
strenuous defense until relievedâ all this told in a dispatch from Admiral Seymour received by the Admiralty at midnight,
which rur.F as follows:
"TIENTSIN, June 27 (via Chefu, June 23, 10:05 p. m.)â Have returned to Tientsin with the forces, having been un
able to reach Peking- by rail. On June 13 two attacks on the advance guard were made by the Boxers, who were repulsed
with considerable loss to them and none on our side. On June 14 the Boxers attacked the train at Lang Yang in largo
numbers and with great determination. We repulsed them with a loss of about 100 killed. Our loss was seven Italians.
The same afternoon the Boxers attacked the British guard left to protect Lofa station. Reinforcements were sent
Lack and the enemy were driven off with 100 killed. Two of our seamen were wounded.
"IVe pushed forward to Anting- and enpaped the enemy on June 13 and June 14. inflicting a loss of 175. There were
no casualties on our side. Extensive destruction of the railway in our front having made further advance by rail,lm
possible I decided on June 16 to return to Yang Tsun, where It was proposed to organize an advance by the river to
Peking. After my departure from La.ng Yang two trains left to follow on were attacked on June lSbv Boxers and
Imperial troops from Peking, who lost from 400 to 500 killed. Our casualties wore six killed and forty-eight wounded.
These trains joined me at Yang Tsun the same evening. The railway at Yang Tsun was found entirely demolished and
the trains could not be moved. The force being short of provisions and hampered with wounded compelled us to with
draw on Tientsin, Â¦with which we had not been in communication for six days and our supplies had been cut oft.
"On June 19 the wounded, with necessaries, started by boat, the forces marching alongside the river. Opposition was
experienced during the whole course of the river from nearly every village, the Boxers, when defeated in one village re
tiring to the next, and skillfully retarding our advance by occupying well selected positions from which they had to be
forced, often at the point of the bayonet and in the face of a galling fire difficult to locate. . '
"On June 23 we made a night march, arriving at daybreak opposite the Imperial armory above Tientsin, wjiere
after friendly advances, a treacherous heavy fire was opened while our men were exposed on the opposite river bank The
enemy were kept in check by rifle fire in front while their position was turned by a party of marines and seamen un
der Major Johnson, who rushed and occupied one of the salient points, seizing the guns. The Germans, lower down
silenced two guns and then crossed the river and captured them. The armory was next occupied by the combined forces
Determined attempts to retake the armory were made on the following day. but unsuccessfully. We found Immense
stores of guns, arms and ammunition of the latert pattern. Several guns were mounted in our defense and shelled the
Chinese forts lower down. Having found ammunition and rice, we could have held out for some days, but being hampered
with large numbers of wounded I sent to Tientsin for a relieving force, which arrived on the morning of June 25. The
armory was evacuated and the forces arrived at Tientsin on June 26. We burned the armory."

outbreak which has occurred he would
certainlyhave done so. There Is no dis
position to impeach the Minister's veracity
on account of the fact that he has sup
plied the Department -of State with dis
patchrs from Chinese officials stating that
the Ministers were safe with the column
under the command of Vice Admiral Sey
mour. It is appreciated that the Minister
can only furnish to Secretary Hay dis
patches he received, though it is' now ap
parent they must have been based upon
misinformation.
Minister Wu cannot understand how
there can be such a discrepancy between
the dispatches he received and those sent
by Rear Admiral Kempff. He is satisfied
there is a mistake somewhere. At the
fame time he remains confident that the
Ministers are safe.
Careful inquiry made in official and dip

information confirmatory of a report from
Paris that the powers have reached an
agreement in respect to China for the
maintenance of the status quo as regard*
spheres of influence and commercial
agreements and also respecting the nature
cf guarantees and compensations which
will be demanded from China. The Parl3
dispatch also stated that the agreement
fixed the International army of occupa

mee t^ s Â« cI m 1^ 8 . 1 . Tu esday an amendment
to the constitution and by-laws of the
club was suggested. It is proposed that
the management of club affairs be in
trusted to a board of eiifht directors, four
of whom are to hold office for six rooik'-ss
and four for eight months, so that four
directors will .b<Â» chosen at each half
yearly meeting. The board is to elect the
president, secretary, treasurer and com
mittees on finance, regattas and boats.
The house officers are to be subordinate
to the board of directors and to be elected
from the body of the club. As the clÂ«b
has now 121 members the difficulty of
transacting business is apparent.
The folio-wing nominations have been
made for the various club offices: For
president,., caries H. Smith: vice presi
dent, Theodore Eiffeldt: financial secre
tary. C. J. Hague: recording secretary. "W.
D. Hinchman; treasurer. D. Greenleaf:
captain. F. W. Ayers and E. B. Thornine;
lieutenant. Sydney Pollard and D. H.
Everett: mÂ«rribers of executive committee
âPaul Bunker, XV. C. Donnelly and E. M.
Hunter; delegates to Pacific Association
of Amateur Athletic Union (three to be
elected) â John A. Hammersmith, W. B.
Hlnehman. E. M. Hunter and W. G. Han

constitution are passed at the next meet-
Ing the foregoing nominations will become
void and the election of . a> board of di
rectors will be proceeded with.
Some friction has already occurred be
tween the rowing committee of the semi
centennial celebration of the Native Sons
of the Golden West and the delegates
from the boating clubs. It has been as
serted that the men who attend the com
mittee meetings as representatives of the
Ariel Rowing Club have never been
chosen for that work by- the members,
and a suggestion has been made that a
committee Â©f three from each club should
be appointed to manage the Towing races.

HOMING PIGEONS TO RACE
The California Pigeon and Homing.So
ciety will hold its third race of the nortt}- 1
em teries for young birds to-morrow from
Red ' Bluff .. This race is looked forward to
with interest, because as; an experiment
some of the birds have been trained care
fully, while others have not flown since
the Marj'svllle race of the .17th inst., in
which race the coast record was broken.
The following owners will be represented
to-morrow: A; E. Wray, three-birds; G.

Henry Vftn Cortebeek of the California
Pigeon and Homing: Society had- a suc
cessful fly on. the 24th Inst. , The birds wer e
liberated at Sisson, 338 miles by rail from
this city. They were liberated at 5 a.m.,
at which time a. strong south wind was
blowing. The first bird arrived at 3:01 p.
in., the second at 3:16, third at 4:45 and
fourth at 4:52. The two remaining birds
did not return the same day.
A change was made in" the schedule
this week on account of , the Btockton
Fair. There was a demand for a ball
game at Stockton, so the magnates agreed
to transfer the San Francisco-Stockton
game from this city to the Slough City.
As a consequence the Sacramentos will
play two series in succession on the local
diamond.- The Oaklands made a phenom
enal spurt when they last met the Sac
ramentos away from the home of 'the
champions. It was an off week for the
men from the capital.,. They dropped two
games and made a: tie. of the third. On
this trip they will encounter a different
aggregation, as some of Manager Ew
ings brightest young men are playing on
the diamonds of Montana. The last to
leave him was pitcher Steffani, who
when he was asked for his terms by the
Montana Club some weeks since, replica
that about $500 per month would geihis
game. He was offered" $175 and refused"
Then came the $ 200 offer, which he ac
cepted and was thereupon put upon the
California League blacklist for breaking
his contract. Manager JCwing still has
pitchers galore and. he thinks that his
team is as strong as ever. ' Â¦

CRICKET AT THE SEASIDE.
â¢Last Sunday's play afforded a striking
example of the difficulty, of predicting thÂ«
result of a cricket match. The Pacific
team, which/ had been beaten ;by the AlaV
mela eleven^who had in their. turn been
defeated by the | Callfornians, 1 proved it
self a victor over: the Californias by the
ample margin of 78 runs. It may be urged
that two: Pacific batsmen, Coles and
Myers, were "the whole thing," and that'
the. Cnllfornias lacked the services of
Reynolds land Howard. .
To-morrow being <Â¦ an /open aay on the
schedule of. the California Cricket Asso
ciation an eleven of .the Alameda club
will Journey down to "Santa Cruz this
evening. 1 arid to-morrow will play against
the Â¦-' team â¢of the - Santa : Cruz Country
Cricket Club. ;The 'Alameda eleven will
be; as follows.: R. 8./Hogue (captain) J
H.iSaunders, J. J. Mortarty, P. V. Croll'

W. G. Fortmann, F. Stahl,- H. W. Brown

CYCLERS IN COMPETITION.
A racing event of considerable import
ance in cycling will be held to-morrow at
San Joseâ a 15-mile handicap on the mile
horse track there â between teams of fif
teen men each from the Olympic Club
Wheelmen and Garden City Wheelmen.
The particulars of the race and names
of the men on the two teams were pub
lished in last Saturday's Call. This race
will hardly result In a decision as to the
racing strength of the two clubs, as
many of the riders are. not at their best
at this season of the year. But they
have all trained faithfully and the fact
that the event is a handicap should make
it most Interesting. A large delegation of
Olympics, headed by Captain T. G. Spil
lane, will go down on to-morrt>w morn
ing's 9 o'clock train.* returning after the
race. The road from Fruttvale to San
Jose just now is in excellent condition and
many will doubtless ride down to-morrow
forenoon. x
P!easanton,has quite an ambitious pro
gramme of cycling events scheduled for
the celebration there on July 4. There
will be six open events and the prizes are
good. Chance for a "pot hunt" for some
body.
Great activity has been shown by thÂ«
gentlemen conducting the preliminaries
connected with the proposed cycle path
from this city to San Mateo and the
project seems to be moving ahead without
difficulty. As soon as the route is agreed
upon subscriptions will be taken to do the
surveying work and the path will be
commenced in earnest. The path associa
tion was particularly fortunate in secur
ing such efficient officers. With E. B.
Learning as president, Judge Frank H.
Kerrigan and Charles Albert Adams on
the board and Robert M. Welch as treas
urer there is little left to.be desired.
The match race between H. D. tÃean of
the Bay City Wheelmen and J. E. Wing
of the Garden City Wheelmen will take
place Sunday, July 8, at Centervllle.
Robert A. Smyth has resigned. as offi

SLOOP GADDER
TO DEFEND THE
PERPETUAL CUP
Californias Will Race for the
Wallace Trophy on July
Fourth.
The board of directors of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club and the regatta commit
tee held a meeting- on Tuesday to con
sider the challenge for the Perpetual cup
forwarded last week by the Corinthian
Yacht Club.
It was decided to accept the challenge
and Com mode re. "Ws N. McCarthy and ex-
Commodore Isidore Gutte were appointed a
committee to confer with Matthew T,ur
ner of Benicia with reference to the sloop
Gadder, which will probably be chosen as
the defender. The club last year incurred
preat expense in fitting out the Gadder for
the race against the sloop Truant, putting
an iron shoe and a fin upon her keel,
tiiihi n& a hood to make her conform to
ihe definition of a "cabin yacht" and sup
plyinK her with a new suit of sails. The
cost of preparing her for the race will be
much smaller this year and will probably
be defrayed without drawing upon the
funds of the club. The race will he In
charge of the regatta committees -of the
two clubs and will be under the rules of
the San Franciscos. the challenged paity.
As legardK measurement the rules of tho

about the md pf July.
On July 4 the annual race of the Cali

in th* club and time allowance is given.
Tho present holder of the trophy is.E. J<\

FAST PACE OF
SACRAMENTOS
IS MAINTAINED
Other Teams in California
-Baseball League Cannot
Overtake Champions.
A combination of luck ana base hits
played havoc with the San Francisco
baseball team last week, sending the Teu-
tons farther down the toboggan and ele
vating the champions to a high notch. It
now seems that nothing short of a Rusie
could stop the champions in their upward
ilight, b\it Manager Harris is still hope
ful. He has considered the possibility of
securing the services of Rusie or some
other high priced twirler with a stout

still fighting for second place and both
are within striking distance of the lead

POOLROOMS ARE
NOT TOLERATED
AT SACRAMENTO
The Press and the People
Take a Decided Stand
Against Them.
The citizens of Sacramento have taken
a decided Â¦ stand in the matter of pool
rooms in that city, the Bee going so far
as to say that Sacramento can afford to
lose the State Fair rather than permit
the poolrooms gaining a foothold^ under
any pretext. The Bee says: v
Said Teter J. Shields, secretary of the
State Board iof Agriculture, in an inter
view in the Bee yesterday:
"AH that is needed by us is the right to
conduct our pooling and bookmaking on the
racecourse durlngr the progress of the fair."
To that no man earnest and honest in the '
rru!=a<le against the poolrooms has ex
pressed or will express any opposition.
The privilege asked on behalf of the Stato
Board of Agriculture wan Â»n"anted In the
original ordinance presented to the Board
of Trustees and indorsed hy the conVmittee
of minister*. â¢ That privilege was taken
away by an amended ordinance introduced
at the instigation of the poolroom owners
and passed -in their interest.
There will be no trouble if the Trustees
are honert and sincere. All that is neces
sary If to do the will of the people and
not of the poohoom gamblers. And the
will of the people is, as it always has been,
that pool selling shall forever be prohibited
in this city, "except on racetracks at such
times as races axe In progress .thereon.". Â¦
The way is easy. Ail that is necessary is
to amend the ordinance back to its original I
position. If that is not done and matters
remain as they are, it will become evident
that the poolroom owners are â¢ actlnp the
part of dogs in the manger and that the
Trustees are helping them in that attitude.
If the Trustees repeal the ordinance or
place any license on the poolrooms which
!s not severely prohibitive it will bÂ« a no
tification to any man of ordinary intelli
gence that they prefer to do the, bidding of
th& poolroom gmnblers rather than con
tlnuft to stand v a barrier against the
worst evil that has ever cursed this com-"
munlty. If the State Fair Is injured there
fore the Bee proposes that the blame shall
be placed exactly where It belongs.
One thing should be remembered, how
ever no -matter what happens: Sacramento
can afford to lose the State Fair. She
I cannot afford t# ever again permit the pool- ..
room Â«iens of vice and crime to flourish in
this community. Nor do we believe that
the citizens of Sacramento will ever again .
tolerate them.- ..
man being the only members present, Mr.
Colvin's appeal was made on the strength
of .his pointer. . Lady C, .having been
awarded the cup offered by the Pacific
Coast Field ' Trials Association for the
best pointer or setter exhibited In the
field trials 'class. J. W. Flynn's pointer
dog- was awarded reserve, and Mr. Klynn
promptly put in a protest against Lady
C.'s win, on; the ground that* the field
trials class is by general usage through
out the United Stales restricted to dogs
that have been placed first, second or
third in some recognized field trials, and
Lady C. had- admittedly not been so
placed. Mr. Colvin's contention was that
the club had accepted without question
his entry and his entry fee for the
pointer in question, and had not inquired
into her qualifications; that the premium
list had stated no restrictions as to eli
gibility, and last, that he had in his pos
session a letter signed by an official of the
club, expressly stating that the only con
dition precedent to entry was that the
dog to be entered should have been pre
viously entered in some recognized field
trial, and that it was not necessary that
the dog should have been placed. It is
probable the meeting will be held during
the first week in July, when the appeal
will be considered.
OUT at picturesque Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park the gentlemen of San Francisco FlycastingClub meet twice a
month to indulge in the gentle pastime of flycastlngr. They are all ardent anglers and know the secrets of every
trout stream, throughout Northern California,- The club was organized about the time of the Midwinter Fair
and has thrived beyond all expectation. The club members /have developed flycastlng to such an extent that
they lead all the world in the art. Walter D. Mansfield holds the world's record for distance, having cast a tiny
fly 133 feet. The greatest cast of the Eastern experts is about 120 feet/ which distance many men here have exceeded. ,
A special gear is used, the line being known as "cosmic tapered.* 1 The average weight of rod used is ten ounces, al
though there is no limit. The length 0f.., the rod is fixed, at eleven feet. Fishing on a stream is on the same prin
ciples, but under different conditions. The largest number of fish are caught at a distance of about forty feet from
the angler. . : ... :'.?:::Â¦Â» .. â¢

The veil of mystery which enveloped
the unexpected combination formed by
Ingleside and Union Coursing Parka is
being gradually .lifted. Although the en
tire coursing fraternity has been busily
engaged seeking 1 some plausible reason
they can find none beyond that of busi
ness expediency. Ingleslde has hardly
paid -running expenses for some time.
while Union Park, although not running
behind, Is said not to have been a source
of profit to Its shareholders. All the con
cessions which resulted in the recent
combination came from Union Park. In
gleside had nothing to offer other than
the suggestion that if it went out
of .business other men leas con
cerned about the future of the sport
would at once open an opposition park.
The directors of Union Park were, after
considerable argument, induced to see a
chance of reconciling their stockholders*.
With no opposition during the four week*
durii.o which they are to promote the
sport and with nominal expenses during
the succeeding three weeks it was ex
plained to them that their profits would
be greater than if they faced continued
opposition.
The suit Instituted by the directors of
Ingleside Coursing Park against Chief of
Police Sullivan restraining him from in
terfering with the coursing there haa
been dismissed. This action was taken at
th^ instance of Ingleside Park's attorney,
the case being dismissed without preju
dice. This move was apparently made to
prevent the possibility of an adverse <le
cision being rendered by Judge Murasky.
Had such a decision been rendered it
would have canceled the agreement re
cently entered into under which the two
coursing parks divide dates. There will
be no coursing at Ingleslde Park Tor Uu
next four weeks. They will then promote
coursing for three weeks. When their
turn comes around again at the expira

to have its proposed grounds in San.

played on the California Club courts. The
most important was between the Hardy
brothers, resulting in a tie. R. Hunt of
Alameda defeated W. B. Collier Jr in
straight sets 6-3, 6â4, 6-2, 6â4. C. B.
Root won from Johnson 7â3. 10â8. 6â4.
Robert Whitney defeated Grant Smith
C â 2, 6âl.6 â 1. 7â S. Johnson defeated James
A. Code 6â3. 7â5, 6â S. Bishop Moreland
won from Percy Kahn three sets to one
Collier lost to R. Whitney 3-6. 3-6. 7â5
George Whitney beat Grant Smith 7â5.
6â3. Mr. Waterman of Penryn Citrus
Colony played several matches with AI
Rosenberg.
Some the best matches will take place
in the preliminary and first rounds, as a
number of good players have drawn to
gether. S. P. Hardy vs. G. Smith will be
interesting, as Smith always makes a
good showing against a tleverer man. C.
B. Root vs. Alex Stewart will be close,
with the odds in favor of Root. In the
match between R. Hunt vs. Code both
players have the same style and steadi
ness, with Hunt having a little the best
of it. Will Cook vs. Paul Jones will be
the old school $*s.'the new; W. B. Collier
vs. Crowell will be two chums as con
testants, with Collier the favorite. Percy
Murdoch will probably work out to the
semi-finals, where he will meet one of the
Hardys. Robert Whitney will be in the
finals unless there should be a dark horse
in his half of the drawing- â possibly Hunt.
Several of the old players will be" missed
this year, as George Bradshaw, R. Bliven
Harry Weihe. W. C. Routh. Paul Selby,
Harry Dibblee. J. J. Crooks and Dr. Phil
lips did not enter. Their absence will bÂ«
made up by several new facesâ Paul
Jones, T. Murdoch, Bishop Moreland, Alan
Owen. John O'Brien, M. Leventritt, Percy
Kahn. Percy Bailey. Fred Brown and also
the veteran Alex Stewart of Oakland.
The thirteenth annual tournament for
the tennis championship of the Pacific
Coast will commence at San Rafael to
day at 10:30 a. m. under the auspices of
the United States National Lawn Tennis
Association. Suitable prizes will be pre
sented the winner fend the runner-up of
the all-comers, and . the -winner will play
George'F. Whitney (holder) for the cham
pionship cup on July 4. A consolation
doubles will also be held July 3 and 4 for
those defeated at singles.
The "wise ones" have picked the Hardy
brothers as the winners of the all-com
ers, but whether it will be Sam or Sum
ner opinion is evenly divided. As to
whether either of the Hardys can win
from George Whitney, the champion, is
a different matter. This year's match
will decide the ownership of the cham
pionship cup, as George Whitney and also
tiam and Sumner Hardy have' each two
wins to their credit. . .

Athletlc r Club to-night Jimmy Handler of
Newark rwas awarded the', decision on a
foul over "Mysterious Billy" Smith Of
New York in the fifteenth 'round of what
was to have been a twenty-five round bout
at 148 pounds. It was a vicious battle, and
another- punch by either man would have
brought it to a conclusion... without the
referee's interference when the foul nas
committed, as both men were wobbling
from the effect of right-hand. smashes on
the jaw. , â¢ r
Smith Fouls Handler.
At the end of the third twenty-five Nau
nian had scored sixty-eight and Halght
was close behind with one bird less. In
the last quarter Nauman dropped all his
birds, while his less successful opponent
had one miss and three dead out of
bounds.
Halght was unfortunate throughout the
match in getting the majority of hard
twisting birds, while Nauman was lucky
in scoring on birds that, flew around and
finally dropped Inside. Halght was ap
plauded liberally on several occasions for
clever second barrel kills of erratic fliers.
In his first batch of pigeons Halght was
handicapped by getting hard birds in suc
cession.
The match was a clever exhibition of
shooting and of the nineteen birds missed
eleven dropped dead out of bounds and
eight got away. Following are the scores:

The fire started on a platform of
wood constructed on the west roof of the
building. This platform had been used
in connection with a laundry that was
once a part of the club. The boards, long
exposed to the heat of the sun, had thor
oughly dried out and burned like tinder.
It is supposed that a spark from the
kitchen chimney ignited them. A num
ber of members and attendants of the
tlub were in the building when the blaze
was discovered and after turning In an
alarm from an auxiliary box they set at
work to light the fire with a small hose.
The flames had gained too much head
way, however, and 6oon began to work
their way through the roof of the struc

The signal that the blaze was In pro
press was given while the Chief of the
fire fighters and five of his assistant*.
were attending the Sweeney benefit at
the Grand Opera-house. A small gong
had been placed In the playhouse and
without causing: any commotion the fire
men left the scene of pleasure for the

"When Chief Sullivan arrived at the 'fire
he immediately turned in a second alarm.
Shortly afterward the blaze was under
control and he started to return to the
Grand Opera-house. He had scarcely
reached the entrance to the theater when
a messenger overtook him. Into the
Chiefs hand was slipped a letter. It ex

for his efficient work In subduing the

A fire that threatened to assume menac

TIE trotting circuit for the season of
1900 will open at Santa Rosa on Mon
day next, and although the entry list
for this, the first meeting of the year,
is not as large as usual, the class of horses
entered Is better than ever and there is
every prospect of one of the greatest
weeks of harness racing ever seen in the
State. The programme for the Fourth of
July is one that should draw every ad
mirer of fast trotters and pacers to Santa
Rosa, and predictions are freely made by
those most competent to Judge that more
fast miles will be made there than have
ever been seen on a California track In
one day's racing.
In addition to the regular programme
Adolph B. Spreckels' peerless mare Dione,
2:03Â»i. queen among Californlan trotters,
will be sent against the track record of
2:IL Charles Jeffries will drive her. and
if conditions prove favorable she is ex
pected to trot close to 2:08. Dione would
be seen in competition, but there is no 2:10
clap?, to which she is eligible, on the pro
gramme, and the free-for-all did not fill.
Dione, Toggles and Klamath are the only
trotters on the coast eligible to this. The
latter two have been retired, leaving
Dione queen of the trotters. The mare
has been campaigned during the past two
seasons on the grand circuit by Thomas
Keating, hy whom she was given her rec
ord at Cleveland in IS9S. She is a bay
mare, eight years old and Is by Eros out
of Grade S. 2:22. EroÂ» was bred at the
Palo Alto stock farm and is by Elec
tioneer. Hfr disposition has not been
spoiled by her racing, any one being able
to drive her. She is a great favorite of
her ownr-r. The trotting record of this
coast is credited to Sunol. 2:osy,. and was
made at Stockton. Stambcul was sent a

list this year. As the Santa Rosa track
Is admittedly one of the best and fasiest
in the State the prediction that the 2:11
trot at Santa Ro.=a will furnish the fastest
race of the circuit has a good foundation.
The 2:10 pace will have but four starters,
but every one is a crackerjack. Clipper
2:oSsi. a son of Diablo, has been working
so well that a mile in 2:07 is expected of
him. while Little Thorn 2:0914 "can prob
ably put in three heats In his record time
if asked to on Wednesday next. Flora
cita, 2:11^., the fast daughter of Red
Cloak, will start In this race. She has
been trained at Santa Ana this year and
the only thing known about her present
form outside the stable is that she paced
a public mile against a bicycle rider at
Santa Ana in May and wan beaten about
ten feet in 2:09%. Jessie C, 2:10 1 i. Is an
Eastern mare by Alroy and will represent
Stlce & Maben of Los Angeles in this
race. She worked more than one heat in
2:10 before being shipped to Santa Rosa
and there Is a rumor out that 2:07 or bet
ter will be made by the horse that beats
her to the wire. These two races alone
would furnish a high-class programme
for one. day at any grand circuit track,
but In addition there will two more
events that will be drawing cards. One
is a race between horses owned by mem
bers of the Golden Gate Park Driving As
sociation of this city, in which about
eight horses will start. Among the
other features of the week will be the
Breeders' futurity stake for three-year
olds. The trotting division, will have six
entries and four colts- will contest for the
portion set aplde for pacers.
In the 2:23 and 2:40 trotting races the
green horses will make their first appear
ance for the year. Among the horses in
this class that have shown speed enough
to warrant their being placed in the "very
promipinu" division nre William Morgan's

The coaches predict a record-breaking
time if to-morrow's weather is a repeti
tion of to-day's warm sun. cloudless sky
anrl lack of more than a pleasant breeze.
All of the coaches busied themselves in
giving preparatory touches to the boats
In which the men will row and to-morrow
morning they will go over them again
carefully. The coaches declare their men
are in the pink of condition. Added to
this satisfactory report is the admission
of everybody concerned that they are all
satisfied with the course" as drawn by
them in the various races. There does
not seem to be any disposition on either
the part of the crews* or the adherents
of the colleges to make any excuses for
their representatives in the race. All
concede that the races will be rowed on
merit alone.
The following: . named have been ap
pointed officials of. the race to-morrow:
Refereeâ Richard Armstrong, Tale.
TJmekeeperâ Evert Jansen Wendell, ftarvar.d.
Becords May Be Broken.
The varsity race Is causing more dis
agreements in expert circles than any
previous races in years, and this Is be
lieved to be due to a divergence of opinion
as to the relative merits of the" strokes.
It : is a singular fact that five distinct
strokes are being rowed here and will bo
tested in the race to-morrow In contra
distinction to an almost similar stroke
rowed by Yale and Harvard on Thurs
day. In fact, the strokes are radically
different, the only generally applied prin
ciple being in the case of Cornell. Penn
sylvania and Georgetown, all three of
which agree upon the strone use of the
leg to finish out the stroke after the back
of the man Is perpendicular In the boat.
There. 'however, comes at once a differ
ence, for Georgetown completes the
stroke with the shoulders, Cornell with
the arms and Pennsylvania with both
arms and a longer slide. Columbia uses
.the shoulders to a large degree all
through the stroke, while the great dif
ference in the Wisconsin stroke from the
others Is the sharp, quick catch and the
quick recovery. Georgetown will row the
fastest stroke on the river, starting at
forty, dropping down to thirty-eight and
getting back again to forty-one and forty
two. It is a hustle, but ft seems to make
the boat go at a good rate.
The first race will be the four-oarea
event to be rowed over the two-mile
course, beginning at the two-mile post
on the University Course and finishing at
the regular finish line. This race is sched
uled for 4 o'clock and. the others will be
rowed as soon afterward as the referees
and Judges can be placed. The freshmen
race follows the four-oared event and iÂ»
to take - pla.ee over . the same two-mile
course. The varsity race is over the
four-mile course and It is expected will
take placo about 6 o'clock, a fine time of
the day for rowing.
Difference in Strokes.
POUGHKEEPSIE. N..T., June 29.â A
smashing of . intercollegiate records for
varsity eight-oared shells if the wind and
weather are favorable, or at least one of
the most hotly contested races ever rowed
by collegiate crews in this country, is
promised for to-morrow on the splendid
course opposite this city. . ,
So far as the consensus of opinion
among the experts is concerned, it is be
lieved that -the four-oared event, which,
will open the racing at 4 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon, will go to Pennsylvania.
Its crew has shown superb form in prac
tice, Mr. Ward, the coach, giving the
men quite a good deal of attention, while
the coaches of Columbia and Cornell have
seemingly neglected their four-oared
crews, and they do riot row In the same
good form as the freshmen- and varsity.
Mr. Courtney of Cornell, however, pro
fesses to believe that while his four-oared
crew does not show up in the usual neat
Cornell form' they, are very fast, and this
has been in-, a measure demonstrated in
their practice with the eights.
In tne iresnmen eights tne youngsters
from Wisconsin arti picked as winners by
the same experts that pick .Pennsylvania
in the fours*. That they are very fast is
not to be ii'ispotec 1 ., and they have a
quick, snappy style that usually counts
tor much in the short two-mile race; but
the Pennsylvania treshmen are aiso very
quick and have given the varsity crew a
good bustle many times lately, showing
continuous improvement that may be
dangerous to the success of the Wisconsin
men. Cornell Is usually a feature in the
freshmen races here and has by no means
conceded that it Is outclassed, while the
Columbia boys. If they do not forget the
Hanlan stroke, will be In the foremost or
the fight. It will be what the college boys
call a "scrappy" race from start to fin
ish, and it looks now as if it would be
done In fast time. â¢ -

FOREIGN RESIDENTS IN CHINA.
These figures show that Russia made the
greatest gain in the matter of residents
and Japan in the number of firms, France
coming next in the latter respect. Consul
Fowler says that these figures do not In
clude the leased ports, and that It must
be remembered that In the case of Great
Britain a large number of Hindoos and
Asiatics (Chinese born in Hongkong, the
Straits, etc.) are Included. Consequently
it is difficult to determine the true number
of Brittsh In China. Moreover, by British
law every British subject is compelled to
register in his consulate, but with Ameri
cans this registration is optional. Consul
Fowler expressed the belief that the num
ber of American residents Is greatly un
derestimated.
The total number of residents, 17.193.
shows an increase of 3772 over IS9B. The
total number of firms, 933, shows an In
crease of ICO over IS9B.
Interesting statistics concerning foreign
ers in China are contained in a report on
trade relations between China and the
United States, just received at the State
Department from Consul Fowler at Chefu,
dated May 7 last. The table of foreigners
is divided into two classes, residents and
firms, and includes statistics for the years
IS9B and 1899. The total foreign residents
are stated as follows:
In 1593. 13.421; 1599, 17,193, and the foreign
firms as follows: 1898, 773; 1593, 933.
The nationality of the foreign element
for IKW is stated as follows:
American, residents 2335, increase over
IS9B of 279; firms 70, increase of 27.
British, residents 3562, increase of 414;

The Call does not hold Itself responsible for
the opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may

Editor Call: A short time ago there ap
peared in one of our evening papers an
article titled "Scouting in South Africa."
In this article there was quoted from a
little book written by the hero of Mafe
king tho following: "Scouting one day In
Matabeleland I discovered the spoor of
a party of women and boys, and following
it found a leaf. There were no trees nearer
than a village fifteen miles away, whence
the tracks seemed to lead. The leaf
smelled of beer. This signified that it had
been used with others to stop the mouth
of a pot of beer and had blown away."
He goes on to say that the wives of Boer
soldiers are accustomed to carry beer to
their lords and masters and that he soon
fbund the party of Boers in such a state
of Intoxication that he could easily flnd
out what he wanted.
According to this famous scout and hero
the Boer women carried a pot of beer
large enough to intoxicate a party of Boer
soldiers, as he designates them. As a
former resident of this country I wish to
say that there are no leaves in Matabe
land large enough to cover such beer pots,
and although the Dutch and Germans are
supposed to drink beer continually, the
Boers do not use beer and do not know
how to make it. But the point the hero
scout is trying to make is that the Boer
women are brutes and that the Boers
themselves are drunken sots, and when
speaking about lords and masters he tries
to convey the idea that the husbands of
the Boer ladies treat their wives as slaves.
To judge from these extracts of this
book the contents could only be digested
by jingo Englishmen. Â¦ Anglomanlacs and
English boys under 10 years of age. When
in the beginning of the war the Boers
went through Bechuanaland to round up
the cattle of the chartered company (the
only source of revenue the company has
with which to pay a dividend on a capital
of Â£27,000,000) the heroic Baden-Powell, in
stead of defending that property, crawled
like a rat In a hole in Mafeking, thereby
exposing the women and children of that
place to starvation, and only when a su
perior force from two fides arrived did
he dare to show himself. Now he is es
tablished as a hero all over the world by
the versatile English war correspondents,
while to those who know South Africa
and the people of that country Baden-
Powell appears from his book on "Scout
ing" as a contemptible cur and not as a
gentleman, and a brave officer, and as a
coward from his record so far in, this war.

A DISAPPOINTED FAKER
VILE as has been the course of the Examiner
for many a year, it has rarely ever shown its
spite in a meaner way than it did yesterday in
its tlaunts and sneers at Judge Bahrs in commenting
upon his decision in the Fresno rate case. Evidently
the Examiner desired the Judge to give a decision in
favor of the Southern Pacific Company in order that
it might have a chance to use it as a part of the am
munition it intends to employ in the coming cam
piign. The decision, being in favor of the law and
the people, left the Examiner no opportunity to make
political capital out of it, and in a freak of spite the
yellow journal turned upon the Judge. Having no
grounds for attack, it set about inventing them.
Falsehood was substituted for fact, and the Judge,
instead of being commended, was held up for public
scorn.
By way of making cut a case against the court the
Examiner said: "Judge Bahrs assigned the case to
himself. It should have been heard and decided
within a week. But after holding it for months Judge
Bahrs has found himself, like the Railroad Commis
sion, unable to uphold the company, and has issued
the injunction prayed for by the Attorney General."
The statement that the Judge found himself unable
to uphold the company carries with it the insinuation
that he would have upheld the company had he been
able to do so. and is worth noting as an Illustration
of the Examiner's method of suggesting lies it is
afraid to tell. However, there are a good many lies
it is not afraid to print, and one of them is contained
in the assertion that the case was held by the Judge
for months The case was submitted to Judge Bahrs
on May 31 and was decided on June 27. Thus it
was held not for month?, but for less than one month.
Under the law the Judge had ninety days in which to
give decision, and the decision was given in less than
thirty.
The charge of the Examiner is, however, more
unjust than appears on the surface. Since the case
was submitted Judge Bahrs has held court in two de
partments, and therefore has had an extra pressure
of business upon him. The case as submitted con
tained upward of seventy-five citations, each of which
had to be examined in the interests of justice, and the
work consequently could not be hurriedly done.
Finally, as an evidence of a desire to give the deci
sion as promptly as Mas commensurate with the care
due to its importance, it is to be noted the Judge ad
vanced it ahead of fifteen other important cases on
the calendar. Here, then, in the record is ample
proofthat Judge Bihrs. so far from trying to hold
the case back, actually did all in his power to hasten
it. and. in fact, did hasten it to such an extent that the
promptness of the decision is one of the features of
the case which most merits public commendation.
In the Â«cope of the politics of a free country there
must be room for the foulness of foul minds to vent
itself. There must be sewers to carry off the ordure
of the city, and there must be an Examiner to serve
2s a conduit for the ordure of Democratic politics.
Still the sewerf are not left open to the air, nor is it
permitted to any one to spatter the filth of them
upon the public. So it should not be permitted to the
Examiner to vent its dirty politics upon clean men.
What has been done in this mean assault against
Judge Bahrp is a warning of what may be expected
during the whole course of the coming campaign, and
it is therefore well to direct public attention to the
offense at once, so that the community may be on
guard hereafter.
THE NEW DIPLOMACY.
CHINA has agreed that American Consuls may
communicate directly with provincial Viceroys
in regard to the protection of foreigners, with
the assurance that as long as a Viceroy will see that
tney are not molested foreign troops will not be
landed in his province.
The Viceroy of Shantung has notified foreigners
dwelling inland that he cannot protect them.
There is no question of the wisdom of this arrange
ment to have direct communication, without the
roundabout appeal to the central government. But
while we are present with an armed force in China
to protect Americans and other foreigners there, and
are killing and being killed, taking potluck with pot
shots with the other Christian powers, it is highly
desirable that we show ourselves at home thoroughly
devoted to the principle we are shooting into China.
There are places in this country where Chinese are
not tolerated. To appear means death to them. This
antipathy to Asiatic foreigners extends to the Japan
ese. On the same day that we shot our way into
Tientsin neck and neck with the British two hundred
Americans at Keswick, Cal., expelled twenty-five
Japanese laborers from that vicinity, under threat of
slaughter and penalty, of death if they return to fin
ish the work they had agreed to do.. Is the Governor
of California, like the Governor of Shantung, unable
to protect foreigners inland in this. State? Is the rule
of consular communication double-ended and recip
rocal, and should the Japanese Consul appeal directly'
to the Governor of- California and land troops here :f
he fail to protect these foreigners? * : â¢
These Asiatics are intensely disliked here. Doesit
not occur to us that Americans and other Caucasian
foreigners are just as intensely disliked in China?
Racial prejudice is a mutual aversion. How can we
expect genial friendship and affection from the
Asiatics in their country when we make no effort to
hide our hatred of them in our country?
In the worldwide hurly-burly that holds the center
of the stage just now the Keswick incident is likely to
escape notice. But we note it as a sign of the times.
We were first to warn the country that such scenes
would occur as the result of admitting Japanese to this
State. It was inevitable. Now what will be done
about it? Does our Government intend to furnish an
army to protect every gang of Japanese and Chinese
laborers? If it do not, then we should at once with
draw our troops from China and cease insisting that
that Government must give armed protection to
Americans within its jurisdiction. It will be seen
that the issue raised is one of race distinction and
classification. It is far-reaching. When it was raised
by Mr. Richardson and Senator Short in The Call a
few months since, in discussing our racial contacts in
the Philippines, no one dreamed that it would have
such a speedy and startling illustration.
THE SCAVENGER CfJRTS AGAIN.
WHEN The Gall some time ago made an expo
sure of the extent to which the scavengers of
the city violated the law requiring them to
have a proper cover upon their carts and wagons, a
pronfise was made of immediate reform. The police
at the time made several arrests, and it was believed
the nuisance and the menace to health of carrying the
refuse of the city through the streets in open vehicles
would be permanently abated. It now appears the
promise has been unfulfilled, and the popular expecta
tion of reform has been disappointed. The scaven
gers, like so many other violators of law who are
confronted with a demand for its enforcement, simply
made a seeming compliance at the time and then
waited for the storm to blow over so that they could
resume the old offense. *
Such being the condition of affairs, it is gratifying
that Chief Sullivan has resolved to permit no further
delay in the enforcement of the law. lie has issued
an order to the police that beginning on Monday,
July 2, the ordinances, and orders of the city relating
to the subject "are to be strictly and rigidly enforced."
The order declares: "All wagons used in the trans
portation of garbage must be lined with zinc, sheet
iron or other metallic substance" and shall be water
tight; and the covers must be of oiled canvas and be
securely fastened at all times, except when garbage
is being put into the carts, and must be on whether
the carts are loaded or empty."
There are about 300 scavenger wagons in the city,
and it is estimated that more than 100 of them have
not been fitted in accordance with the law. More
over, even among those that have been provided with
covers there is still a tendency to evade the purpose
of the law. Thus the Chief states in his order: "I
have noticed of late wagons going through the streets
and from appearances it would indicate that on the
garbage they had placed barrels extending above the
top of the wagon, over which they placed the covers.
This must not be. permitted. The top of the barrel
must not at any time extend above the top of the
wagon."
The evils resulting from this particular violation of
law hardly need to be pointed out. The odors
emanating from uncovered scavenger wagons pass
ing along the streets are among the worst offenses
that can be committed against a decent community,
but there is, furthermore, a serious danger to health
in permitting refuse, which frequently contains dis
ease germs, to be openly exposed to the air that
thousands of people breathe. All of these evils are
well understood, and there will be a cordial approval
of the actions of the police in enforcing the law by
the arrest of every offender seen upon the streets.
Tory for the party in this city by acting- promptly, but if they neglect this opportunity
they will have a hard battle before them to cleanse the organization of the dishonest ele
ments the bosses will put into it. Remember, this is the last day.

A miner's inch is defined as "the amount
of water which will pass through an
opening one inch square under a pressure
of six inches." This unit is peculiar to
the Western States, used not only for min
ing purposes, but wherever it is desired to
measure the amount of water distributed
for irrigation. The average discharge
from such an opening, railed a module, is
l*s cubic feet per minute. In the various
States from California to Colorado there
|3 some slight variation. In California It
is from J.2i) to 1.76 cubic feet per minute,
according to arbitrary rule adopted. For

WE TAKE it for granted that all good Republicans desire to win for the party a
complete victory in this-city and county. That desite 1 tends' to the welfare of the
city as well as oi the Republican party, and is therefore ' shared by independent']
citizens. Businessmen know that the Republican party stands not only for national
prosperity, but for good local government, and therefore outside of strictly partisan con
siderations it is eminently desirable the Republican party should win.
To attain that end it is now important and almost absolutely necessary that busi
ness men, professional men and workingmeVi of the Republican party should enroll them
selves in the Republican clubs which, under the direction of the Central Committee, are
now being organized in the various Assembly districts. Those clubs will nominate dele
gates to he voted for at the primaries, and it is hardly necessary to point out to intelligent
men that the delegates so nominated will have a great advantage over any who may be
Here, then, is the situation. The club delegates will win certainly in a majority of
the districts. They will control the convention and through it will come into possession
of the party and hold it until the next municipal campaign. Therefore, should
the Kelly and Crimmins gang get control of the clubs they will have a long start toward
getting control of the party machinery, and will have a potent voice; if not a dominant
one, in forming- the next municipal ticket. Thus the issue involves not only the nomin
ations for Congressmen and legislators in this campaign, but municipal nominations
later on.
It is a foregone conclusion that the people will not elect Republican nominees if
they be nominated by a convention under control of saloon-keepers. That means we
shall have a continuance of the Democratic regime of unswept and unlighted streets, no
public improvements and that bubonic Board of Health whose senseless quarantine has
lost to the trade of San Francisco millions of dollars.
Thus it will be seen that the control of the Republican district clubs is a matter of
critical importance to good citizens and to honest Republicans. Now, there is only one
way to control them in the interest of honest politics, and that is for the better class of
Republicans to join them, so as to be able tojelect officers when the time comes for organ
izing them. If the better elements of the party do not join the clubs they will have none
but themselves to blame when disaster comes, as it surely will come should ' Kelly and
Crimmins triumph.

commencement week, usually so full of

Surprises Promised.
One feature of the ball at the pavilion
will be a burlesque on the coronation of
the Queen. Some of the wags of the town
have come together and prepared a bur
lesque on Queen Genevieve's Investiture.
This is said to be very funny and much

are promised, surprises. ?o they say, foi

Hot air â the real thing, not the gaseous
substance that flatters the soulâ has
camped upon Stockton, and its thirst-pro

through which the fair is looked at to its
greatest advantage.
All Stockton, the male portion of it, has
taken to gin-rickeys, just to keep cool
and comfortably moist. The expectancy
of the morrow has something to do with
this.
The life to-night has been along the
midway, where the grotesque and wonder

crowds. Here is the noise anJ excitement

This afternoon was qui,et as far as the
celebration went. Queen Gtnevieve. at
tended by her royal suite, all in court
costume, arrived at the plaza Just in time
to review the street sports held In front
of the grand stand. There was not quite
so much color and flamor to the second
appearance of her Majesty. The heavy
costumes In which the suite was clothed
and the royal purple and ermine of the
Queen were conducive to a liberal flow
of persplrcrWon, which entailed a general
mopping of brows. But the Queen's pop
ularity is not yet on the wane. In the
evening she made her third appearance
before a crowded grand stand and the
populace was alive to thÂ» presence of
royalty once again. Country sports and
pastimes, were the entertainment fur
nished the people this evening.
A parade of the concession occupants
was to be the principal feature of the
evening's programme, but a hitch pre
vented. There was general good nature
exhibited this evening and plenty of Jol

by additional pieces, gave a concert, after
which the crowd took to the concessions
again.

Never before has this etald town ot

time of words and the worst is expected.
By order of the Klnp, who will taste a
few hours of circumscribed authority, all
Stocktonlans. visitors and "foreigners on
the soil, are ordered to appear in mask.
And they will do it. too. Stockton will be
a pay city to-morrow evening with Its
thousands "of revelers*, merrymakers and
feasters in ncise. The streets will ring
with a medley of shouts and banter.
From far and near .visitors will pour Into

their portion unless all plans, prepared
with the utmost care, fall to the ground.
These are some of the bands of people
who will reach Stockton to-morrow.
From San Francisco an excursion train
will arrive at noon. The lone Reform
School band will be here In the morning.
Two excursions from Sacramento, one
the Klkn the other the Chamber of Com

the afternoon. Besides this there will be
another special from Sonora. On Monday
the San Joaauin Valley will send its
contingent by way of the Santa Fe route.
This influx will arrive in time for the
great ribbon parade which is to be the
spectacular event of the eight days'
show Then apain every boat from San

into the city, so it is no wonder that
Stockton's streets are crowded.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY, June 29.â Great anxiety Is
felt here as to the safety of Mrs. H. C.
Hoover of this city, who is now in Tien
tsin, China. Mrs. Hoover is the eldest
daughter of Charles D. Henry of this
city, cashier of the Bank of Monterey,
and went to China with her Jiusband
about eighteen months ago. Mr. Hoo
ver is chief engineer In the Imperial
Department of Mines of China. He and
his wife are probably safer than the ma.
Jority of foreigners now in China because
they are under the direct protection of
Chang Yen Mow, Imperial Director Gen
eral of Mines, and one" of the most pow
erful officials of 'the Government, but as
nothing has been heard from them' herÂ©
since matters became so very bad in
Tientsin Mrs. Hoover's parents feel very
uneasy. The last news received from
them was a cablegram dated at Tientsin
June Â£G, and signed by George Wilson,
Mr. Hoover's assistant, stating that Mr.
and Mrs. Hoover were safe at that time.
Further news is eagerly awaited, for Mrs.
Hoover is a great favorite in Monterey.
Mrs. Hoover is a graduate of Stanford
University of the class of '9S, and is on*
of the few women on this coast that has
taken a degree In the Department of Geol
ogy. She was prominent in fraternal and
co-ed athletic circles at Stanford during
her fouf- years' residence In that Institu
tion and was a charter member of Stan,
ford Chapter of KappaJCappa Gamma So
ciety. She is also a graduate of the State
Normal School at San Jose. Her husband
is likewise a Stanford graduate, having
taken his degree as mining engineer in
'96.
After leaving the university he went to
Australia as consulting engineer for an
English mining company, and about two
years ago was appointed chief engineer
in the Imperial Department of Mines in
China, representing therein a large Eng
lish mining syndicate.
Mr. and Mrs. Hoover (who was Miss
Lou Henry before her marriage) were
married at Monterey in February. 189*,
and sailed at once for Tientsin, China,
where they have since resided, that being
the headquarters of the syndicate which
Mr. Hoover represents.
Her Husband, a Former Stanford
Man, Is Cldef Engineer of the
Imperial Department of
Mines in China.

City Who Is Now in

Buyers From Country Encourage City
Wholesale Grocers in Early Clos
ing on
The movement started early in June by
Wellman, Peck & Co. to close the whole
sale grocery stores on Saturday after
noons is being favorably considered by
quite a number in the wholesale trades of
all kinds. As soon as the firm named an
nounced that it would close Its store at
1:30 p. m. on Saturdays during the summer
months Mau, Saddler & Co., Sussman,
Wormser & Co., J. A. Folger & Co. and
others followed the example, although ail
did not close at the same hour. The sub
ject of early closing was brought before
the Wholesale Grocers' Association, but
that body did not advise taking up the
matter as an organization, although many
of the members expressed the opinion that
it would be a good thing for the employes
and the employers would not be injured in
tho least by easing up on the rush of busi
ness at the end of the week.
The reports of the first steps in the early
closing movement were published a week
ago In The Call, and Mr. Jennings, man
ager Jor Wellman, Peck & Co., states that
those who are interested in the project
have received encouragement in a peculiar
manner. During the past week his firm
and the others mentioned have received
letters from their country customers ap
proving of the effort to shorten the hours
of .the workingmen, and stating that any
orders to be sent to this city will be so ar
ranged as not to interfere with early clos
ing. This encouragement from the coun
try has done more to keep up the new cus
tom than anything else. Mr. Jennings
states that in Chicago, New York. Phila
delphia and several of the larger Eastern
cities the wholesale houses close at noon,
and the practice has been found to be a
great benefit to all. *

Committee of Supervisors Decides
Against Protest of a Bidder on
City Printing.
The Jo'nt Supervisors' Committee on Ju
diciary and Printing took up the consid
eration yesterday of the protest of Phil
lips & Smyth against awarding the con
tract for certain city printing to the Star
Press on account of erasures having been
made in the bids submitted. Attorney
Ruef addressed the committee and con
tended that the charter specifically pro
vided that bids should be rejected if they
had been erased in even one item. He said
this provision was intended to prevent any
combination or fraud on the part of bid
ders. Chairman Brandenstein stated that
the City Attorney had rendered an opinion
that erasures on bids do not necessitate
the rejection of the bids.
The committee decided against the pro
test In accordance with the opinion of the
City Attorney. He says that the charter
gives to the bidder the right to bid upon
"all or any of the articles named, and to
the city the ri?ht to accept the bids upon
any one or more of such articles. There
must be In effect an many separate bids aa
there are articles upon which bids are re
quired. This being so, alterations or
erasures therein would mean alterations
or erasures in the bid upon a certain arti
cle. The board therefore should reject the
bid upon any article In which there Is an
erasure or alteration, but should not on
account of an erasure or alteration reject
all other bids presented in the same offer
or proposal."
ERASURES ON BIDS DO
NOT INVALIDATE THEM

JUDGES WERE ALL BUSY
FREEING THE UNHAPPY
Demands.
A big rush was made on the city treas
ury yesterday by the City Hall employes,
and as a result the money in the treasury
was exhausted at 3 o'clock and a large
number of employes failed to have their
salary demands cashed.
The knowledge that Treasurer Brooks
had decided to tie up the St. Mary's Park
fund of $125,000 until the appeal cf the park
promoters had been passed upon by the
Supreme Court caused consternation in
the army of tax-eaters. As soon as the
Auditor's* office was opened at 9 o'clock a
long line of citj- officials besieged the dep
uties for their demands, and did not cease
until late In the afternoon. When tbe
money available for salaries had all been
paid out the holders of demands were reg
istered in the order of their presentation,
but they will have to wait for their money
unless the brokers come to the rescue.
Expert Cyril Williams had prepared the
following statement of the funds in the
treasury :
St. Mar>'s Park fund. $125,000; to the
credit of the general fund. $40,000; unap
portloned taxes fund, $73,000; Market
Street Railway Company taxes. J10.000;
June fees and licenses. $20,000; total, $143,
000.
Apainst this amount are: Hall of Justice
balance. $:?3.000; Bosworth-street tunnel,
J4000; Bernal Park, $5000; total. $42,000.
leaving available for salaries $101,000.
The salaries unpaid for June will amount
approximately to $100,000, and if the St.
Mary's Park fund be ultimately decided
available for other purposes the demands
will be redeemed.

COMMITTEES APPOINTED
BY THE GRAND JURY
In looking about to abolish a school In
the district south of Market street the
Board of Education is considering the
advisability of closing up the Stanford
Primary. It is highly probable that the
Stanford School as well as the Longfellow
is doomed, though the board may finally
compromise on the closing of only one.
The discontinuance of the Stanford school
meets with the unqualified approval of
Superintendent of Schools Webster. Mr.
Webster is of the opinion that the pupils
of the Stanford could be accommodated
in vacant classrooms in the Franklin
Grammar and the Starr King schools,
situated near by. He is In favor of this
plan, provided, however, a place can be
found for Mrs. Lyons, at present prin
cipal of the Stanford. . Again, if a prin
clpalship can be secured for Miss Jennie
Smith the Longfellow School might be
done away with. The building is a poor
one, though the Echool is well attended.
The premises are contiguous to the Rln
con Grammar School and the Whittier
School, both of which have vacant class
rooms. Should Miss Slavan be retired
from the princlpalshlp lof the Cleveland
School on Harrison street, near Twelfth,
either Mrs*. Lyons or Miss Smith could
be taken care of and either the Stanford
or Longfellow could be abolished without
placing either the principal or the teach
ers on the unassigned list. While both
schools can be abolished, it would neces
sarily crowd the other schools In the vi
cinity. It is certain, however, that one
will be closed and the classes distributed
to tha other scnools mentioned.
Pupils in District South of Market
Street to Be Distributed to Bin
con, Franklin, Starr King
and Whittier.
Either the Longfellow or
the Stanford Will Be
Discontinued.

WILL BE CLOSED
GRAND JURORS
WILL SUE CITY
FOR THEIR FEES
Claim They Are Entitled to
Compensation for
Services. <
Say Points Involved in Case Decided
Adversely to Trial Jurors Doe 3
Not .Materially Affect
Their Case,
Once . again Is the question of Jurors'
fees to.be carried before the courts for
adjudication. This time members of the
last Grand Jury are of the opinion that
the statutory allowance of $2 a day for
services should be paid . them by the city
and county, and they, will file suit in an
effort to. test their right to such com
pensation. Those who will appear In the
suit served as grand Jurors from Decem
ber 29, 1599, up to a week ago Friday:
They are: L. Altschul, William F. Am
brose, J. H. Bremer, H. J. Burns, J. "\v.
Carmany, P. D. Cole, C. L. Field. B. P.
Flint, C. Herrmann, P. F. Kingston, G. H.

rish, M. M. Regensberger, A. Kepsold, E.
R. Rock, A. J. VandeV White, H. M.
Whitely and C. R. 1 Winslow.
Although the right of Jurors sitting In
criminal cases to a fee of $2 a day, pay
able from the treasury of the city and
county, has twice been decided adversely
to the Jurors by the Supreme Court, the
members of the Grand Jury are of thÂ»
opinion that they will recover Judgment
In ita opinion in the last case Involving
the right of Jurors to fees to be paid from
the local treasury the Supreme Court
recognized the statutory right of juror 3
to such fee, but In the absence of any
provision stating by whom such fee was
to be paid the final judgment went against
the Jurors and in favor of the city and
county. The same theory, some attorneys
say. will be adhered tobj' the Supreme
Court when the matter of grand Jurors'
fees comes before them and again the
city will be victorious. The grand jurors,
however, are of different opinion, and will
at least risk the outlay to make the test
If they are successful the whole line of
litigation will be again opened up and a
sum In the treasury exceeding $50,000 will
be of uncertain use until the final Judg
men,t is handed down by the court of last
resort.
Franchise Taxes Collected.
The Alaska Commercial Company paid
Its taxes on a franchise valuation of" $250,
000 to Assessor Dodge yesterday. The Ha
waiian Commercial Company also paid on
a franchise of about $500,000. The Assessor
says that the franchise tax is extremely
small when compared to the yearly earn
ings of the two companies paid in divi
dends. The taxes amounted to about ?12,
000.
It was decided that the committee meet
and act In conjunction with the Board
of Education thereafter on matters per
taining to the School Department.
Brandensteln thought sufficient empha
sis Is not given to the physical training
which, he said, was more nearly of vital
importance than cooking or manual
training. Mark said that the board had
been unable to get a competent instructor
of physical training, though an effort
had been made to secure one. It was in
tended to teach the higher study of phy
sical culture as soon as the proper per
son could be employed.
Chairman Mark explained that the rea
eon for the dismissal of the third special
teachers of physical culture was because
it was believed the regular teachers woula
put the pupils through a simplo course
of calisthenics which would be sufficient.
The centers of manual training and cook
ing would be arranged so that pupils of
all schools could easily be accommo
dated.
Sewing will be taught by the regular
teachers to pupils of the eighth grade
under the supervision of the principals.
The ladies of the California branch of
the Collegiate Alumni have volunteered to
act as a visiting board to encourage thÂ»
study of sewing and to make suggestions
thereon.
Director Denman explained that the
board will establish about seven manual
training centers to which the boys of
the eighth grade will be admitted. Di
rector Klncaid told of the cooking cen
ters to be inaugurated In the Hancock,
Hamilton, Hearst, Franklin, Irving, Scott,
Denman and Horace Mann grammar
schools. The girls of the eighth gradb
will be taught two hours each week, the
course to be one year. Special teachers
will be appointed to explain the chemlstr>
of food by practical demonstration. Mrs.
Kincald eaid there was an alarming ig
norance of the art of decent cooking and
the proper select'cn of nutritious food,
especially amon& the poorer classes. The
establishment of cooking centers would,
she thought. In a great measure over

The prearranged programme of the
Bo&rd ot Health to dismiss six assistant
emergrncy Burgeons did not materialize
last night, owing to a vigorous opposi
tion made by the officials who were slatted
to co. The board ax a secret caucus held
a few evenings aga decided to retain Blx
assistant eurjjeons, each of whom Is a
iavorlte cf one of the members. Those
chosen were: C. M. Armstead, by I>r. Wll
iiamson; V. H. Putnam, by Bazet; H. O.
Van der I^eith, by Baum; \V. M. Thorne,
by Dr. Bucitley: W. R. Dorr, by Dr. Mc-

Phelan. who is an ex-0i3.d0 member of the
board and Incidentally director of affairs

Assistant Surgeons X. R. Starr, C. D.
McOtJiUgan, C ii. Thompson, T. R. Dray,
1* li. liaclgalupi and T.-B. Robinson,
realizing that they were to be ousted, have
been moving; heaven and earth in a poli
caJ way in order to save their onlciaj
necks. They wore partially successlul, as
the board at it* secret caucus la&t night
decided to allow the twelve surgeons to
Uraw straws to determine who should re
main. They were called In by the board
and on its decision being made known
they all positively refused to draw straws
as o< ;:.Â» unprofessional and savoring of
Â£aÂ£nbliiig.
It was originally Intended by Phelan's
orders to subject the twelve surgeons to a
competitive examination, but ten of them
signed a petition not to have the examina
tion. Drs. Starr and McGettigan alone bt
ing in favor of the plan.
The protest was read at the board's
meeting. It is made on the ground that
the charter does not provide for examina
tions, aud the fear wua expressed that
they might be one-sided and unfair. The
twelve surgeons, however, will be obliged
to draw lots after all, as a resolution on
the subject was adopted at the open meet
ing last night, l^ots must be drawn !n
the presence of Chief Surgeon Kdwln Bun
nell, who was reappointed at a salary of
5150 a month.
A caucus of the six assistants originally
slated to go was held late last night, and
they agreed unanimously not to submit
to the board's dictation.
The ten sanitary Inspectors were a!so
ordered to draw lots to determine which
tive will serve the city hereafter. They
will report this evening at 6 o'clock, when
the board will meet to appoint formally

man -walked to the gallows with -a firm
step and gave no evidence of fear of his
impending death save -a sickly pallor on

nelly had grown quite stout, and it was
feared that there mish't be some difficulty
in the final proceeding. .. v
For some days past he showed signs of
nervousness, but they vanished when the

on the trap was due in a large measure to'

Speeches were delivered by Mr. Morley,
the Lord Mayor, the Bishop of London
and others. They all paid tributes to the
magnitude of the benefit conferred by the
work just completed, and made compli
mentary references to America, caused by
Mr. Choatc's presence. Mr. Morley said
he regretted that men like Washington,
Jefferson. Hamilton and Franklin, who,
though Americans, were horn EnKiish
subjects, were not included in the biogra
phy.
Mr. Choate, responding to the toast nf
his health, paid he also was struck by
these omissions. He pointed out that only
one American woman was mentionedâPo
cahontaFâand she only because she saved'
the life of an English captain.
"Indeed." continued Mr. Choate, "every
thing relating to America's separation
from England Is excluded, and the reader
will 'not -learn from the biography that
America ever came into existence ,as a
separate nation. - But the fact that Mr.
Morley claims such n^n as Washington,
Jefferson, Hamilton and Franklin Is an in
dication of the bond which exists between
the two countries â a bond which grows
closer as time goes on."

From a standpoint of- tnorality the

have a "tendency to encourage vice and

that quite a number of children of the

Prize-fighting as held In the count Y is
denounced and the attention of the Super

The Grand Jury believes a more econ

that-at present existing could be devised

State constitution empowering counties
to govern themselves by charters as cities
are now governed. It is believed that

It may. of course, be urged, and Â»r mnst
indeed be admitted, that Hawthorne has
in various ways paid the penalty of his
inherited spirituality and of his morbidly
sensitive nerves. He is afraid of actirA
life; he knows nothing and suggests noth
ing of its acrid, primal Joys; t? he is ai>
aristocrat, he is also an absentee. He has
the dreamer's dim eye for the immediate
fact. The minute details nf conventional
life escape him. The subtleties of man*
ncr and thought in human intercourse
that a highly developed civilization gen
erates have in his writings found no rec
ord. He simplifies life Into its elements
and even among them he chooses onl?
those that are the most rarefied, and lrÂ»
working them into his art he still further
refines them. His Faun, doubtless, used

all his vislonarlness, how little affecta

To read one of Hawthorne's great ro
mances slowly and appreciatively, sub
jecting one's self thoroughly to its influ
ence, is to temper one's self more finely
for all time. Hawthorne was in art an
aristocrat, and his stories, long or short,
are delicately exclusive in style and tone
and subject matter. Everything takes on
quality that passes through Hawthorne' 3
mind and into his prose. Read the "House
of the Seven Gables" and then go to Salem
and look at the unredeemed facts of Salem
streets and life. Or read the "Mosse3
From an Old Manse" and then consider at
Concord the actual, pathetic, weather
beaten structure. Out of harsh or trivial
facts Hawthorne has in each case wrought
a counterfeit presentment that is full of
tender human interest. ,of pathos, of hu
mor, of wise suggestion as regards the
and the value of our wayward
life on this partl-colored earth ballâ full
of picturesque light and shade and dreamy
beauty. These instances are characteristic
of his entire treatment of the world of
fact. The fineness and distinction of Haw
thorne's temperament, the serene wisdom
of his Interpretation ,of human nature,
even when he is most fantastic and
busiest with morbid types, and the power
of his style as a transfiguring medium to
give a lucent charm to whatever it brings
before the reader are too often forgotten
in these days of universal scribbling.
Hawthorne has been sketched by his bi
ographer as often skating "until midnight,
all alone, upon Sebago Lake, with the deep
shadows of the icy hills on either hand."
This picture may well symbolize (the word
is a favorite one with Hawthorne) the
novelist's remoteness from ordinary life.
There used to be a legend that while at
Salem Hawthorne "never saw the sun."
Though this legend Is false, true It is that
he rarely stirred out until after nightfall;
then he took long:, solitary walks through
the deserted streets and by the sea. There
was something of the night In his disposi
tion; "he was fonder." as Sir. James has
said, "of being absent than of being pres
ent." And the worlds he creates or reveals
in his novelsâ these, too, like Hawthorne
himself, are shadowed and full of elusive
ness; the characters "drop from the
clouds"; they come vaguely out of a half,
suspected past; they are just real enough
to make us much of the time forget their
symbolic suggestions; and yet they speed
ily startle us again into a shivering sense
of their other-worldllness. of their dubious
origin and their mysterious mission; they
are creatures set apart; they beckon us
to strange knowledge: we catch from them
now and then a glance full of meaning:;
yet they will not stay to be questioned,
but turn again to some homely or tenderly
human task. Hester Prynne, Pearl, Zeno
bia. the Faun, poor Clifford and even
Hilda all have this tantalizing suggestive
ness and elusiveness.
Yet these half-symbolic characters, in
spite of their trick of now and then seem
inr for a moment but ghosts, capture our
belief and lay hold of our imaginations
far more than Hawthorne's perfectly
possible characters, like Kenyon or Miles
Coverdale. They are indeed Hawthorne's
most genuine creations â spirit of his
spirit and dream of his dream. They are,
moreover, the perfectly natural people
to find dwelling in those twilight cham
bers, or moving along those dimly out
lined streets, or flitting somewhat inex
plicably through those country lanes and
forest depths that Hawthorne's imagin
ation loved to describeâ regions where the
homeliest objects flash out sudden
glimpses of an inner spiritual meaning.
In the "House of the Seven Gables"
Hawthorne somewhere speak 3 with de
lightfully characteristic patronage of "the
big, heavy, solid unrealities, such as gold,
landed estate, offices of trust and emol
ument and public honors." "What, then,
are the realities?" one can fancy a. mod
ern stock broker asking. Hawthorne's
When a reader turns back to Hawthorne
from our modern romances one of the first
impressions is of the distinction of Haw
thorne's work. Our modern romances are
noisy; they have a theatrical glare and
clatter; they lack subtlety and depth of
experience and wisdom and poetry. They
seem the clever but shallow work of me
chanical artists. Their authors know the
tricks of their trade; they are lavish of
local color; they deck out their heroes and
heroines wisely with virtues and foibles In
due proportion, and lead them skillfully
through many hairbreadth escapes to a
happy Issue out of their infirmities. But
when all is said and done, these romances
are only books for a day, and they leave
us where they found us, unless perhaps
they have teased us out of a headache.

"Both the burghers and, the foreigners
who are arriving here profess a strong
belief that it will take from three to six
months to subdue the Boers."
Another dispatch from Lourenzo Mar

"A consignment of a foreign firm mark
ed 'Dutch cheese â damaged,' proved on
landing to contain army boots for the
Boers. It passed the customs, neverthe
less, with unusual dispatch, and the Brit
ish Consul is making protestations to the
Portuguese Government."
A Cape* Town dispatch reports an at
tempt by the Boers to blow up the ar
tillery barracks and magazine at Pre

who frustrated the attempt by withdraw
ing a lighted fuse, was killed by a Boer,
whom the soldiers afterward attempted
to lynch.
"Hunter continued his march yesterday

Lieutenant North, reported missing

train, is a prisoner of the Boers."
Boer official reports from Machadodorp
aver that a part of a British convoy was
captured on June 24 near Winburg.
The Lourenio Marques correspondent of
the Times says:
"Methuen found yesterday that the Boer
laager near Vachkop and Spitzkop had
been hastily removed in the direction of
Lindley. He followed the enemy twelve
miles and captured 8000 sheÂ«>p and 500 head
of cattle, which the enemy had seized in
that neighborhood. Our casualties were
four men wounded.
"On the previous day near Ficksburg
Boyes' brigade was in action with a body
of the enemy. Our casualties were two
officers killed, four men wounded and one
man misslnjr.
"PRETORIA. June 29.â Paget reports
from Lindley that he was engaged on
June 26 with a body of the enemy, who
were strongly reinforced during the day.
A convoy of stores for the Lindley garri
son was also attacked on -June 26, but
after a heavy rear-g^iard action the con

casualties were ten killed and four offi

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 29. -It took about fifteen
irinutes of trading after the opening of stocks
to demonstrate' the disinclination of stocks to
ocntlnue the advance which aroused the hopes
of the bulls yesterday. The market started off
uith a great Â«how of animation and a semb
lance of strength. Prices of Americans were
tip in London, but whether this symptom was
tlie result of operations by cable from this
tide Ss of^n to inference. At all events tbe
edvance in prices seemed to be designed for
the benefit of the shorts, who were anxious to
cover after yesterday*.* rise. The demand from
this element iva.s so liberally fed that It made
â¢ Hgtit impression on prices and after it was
satisfied the market became notably soft. .The
jnovement afterward was irregularly downward
(M a sisaii anoust of business. A great many
trokera left the street and the ma.rket fell
Into a condition of lassitude. A languid move
ment cf prices during the latter part of the
<3ay was largely governed by the fluctuations
in the wheat market, stocks sagging again
vheu the price of wheat raJlied. Sugar and
tome of the steel stocks pave varying evidence
cf strength. Otherwise there was no striking
feature In the market and the closing showed
very little net changes and irregular and un
certain fluctuations. The money market was
e-jrpriFingly quiet up to the close.
Bonds were in better request than stocks
and prices are higher. Total gales, par value,
(1.16.000.

WHEATâ Liverpool and Paris continued to
decline. It was thought that Chicago would
open weak, as some of the etronsreat holders
gave up Thursday, and cables were weak, with
large Argentine shipments, but the opening
was steady. There was a decline from 80c to
70-VjC. but the market subsequently rallied, clos
ing at SITiC. There were mroe buyers than
sellers, tut less action. The condition of the
Illinois crop, af given by the State report, was
67. Xorthwestern receipts were 134 cars. The
trade hnd not recovered tone and was still
timid, even when prices began to harden. For
eign orders were to buy. A large elevator
concern was working a heavy line from Kansas
to Minnei.Dolls. There was a renewed cash
demand at Duluth, where July advanced %c.
There was a good and improving spot demand
at Chlcuro ana all other markets.
The local market was firm in sympathy with
Chicago an>i advanced 2c on call. - Â¦

NEW TORK, June 29. â R. G. Dun' & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The country begins to feel some of the effects
of Its new place among the nations. Influences
affecting its business during, the i week ranged
all the way from a boycott at St. Louis to a
war In South Africa and from sun spots to the
relief of Peklne.
The long effort to hold nominal prices for iron
at Pittsburg has ceased, and the associations
now recognize an open market in which Besse
mer is offered at $19 and billets at $26, with
gray force at $17. Over thirty furnaces are
said to have gone out' of blast, and while some
have been stopped for repairs many more will
be idle for a time until wage scales for the
coming year have been settled with labor organ
izations. With steel plates quoted at $1 30 at
Pittsburg and No. 27 sheets $2 03, no general
gain In business results from the sudden de
cline In structural shapes.
Neither official nor unofficial accounts, have
.removed doubts about the wheat crop, and if it
proves as low as one estimate, 460,000,000 bush
els, the extent to which It may now be dis
placed in European consumption -by corn will
be seriously tested. Exports of wheat and corn
were 429.000.000 bushels In IS9B and 400.000,000 in
18S9 and have been about 190,000,C00 bushels and
210.000,000 bushels corn ' In the crop year 1900,
but never as large before, for in 1592," when 225,
000.000 bushels wheat went abroad, there were
only 73,000,000 bushels corn. Butall recent es
timates of production have been so far dis
trusted, and It Is scarcely good sense to base
grave apprehension on any 60 early in date. In
four weeks of June Atlantic exports of wheat,
flour included, have been 10,980,076 bushels*
against 8.934.C35 bushels last year, and Pacific
exports 2,753,378 bushels, against 2,443.740 bush
els last year. Â¦ - .
The calculation that the woolen :gooda busi
ness was large enough and good enough to stand
anything Is not yet Justlned. The market Is
growing unsatisfactory and.it is no', longer de
nied that some of the . best 1 works have closed
or. materially reduced force. The demand for
men's heavy goods falls much below expecta
tions. With partially different causes, the cot
ton goods . market reaches a similar position
Depression in the market for goods do not pre
vent raw cotton from advancing to 10 cents.

CHICAGO, June 29.â Wheat opened easy,
August unchanged to Uc lower at SlVic to Sic.
Liverpool ' was weak and the Argentine ship
ments heavy â 2,253,000. Liverpool reoovrred
most of its early loss and this was â¢ reflected
here for the moment, August rallying to 81 : ic.
Under moderate selling by commission houses
a decline to So%c followed. ,The selling at this
time was not heavy, ratljer suggesting the
end of the liquidation which sent the market
down since Monday, so there was little pres
sure from buyers. Later the market became
more active and decidedly stronger. Hav
ing digested the news of bumper crops In Kan
sas, Oklahoma. Indian Territory and Missouri
the bulls respectively directed attention to the
light Northwest receipts, fly damages in North
ern Illinois, Ohio and Indiana and Injures
from excessive rains in Kentucky, Tennesses,
Southern Illinois and certain portions of Mis
souri. Attention was aIEO directed to the 18
per cent deterioration khown In the Illinois
crop report, which put the winter wheat con
dition at 67 per cent. They knew nothing about
the spring wheat condition, which the report
makes 93 per cent. At the decline the demand
improved. The cash demand was much livelier
and Wall street Interests appeared In the mar
ket as buyeis. Another assistance to the bulls
.was the announcement that a. concern con
trolling seventy elevators along the Great
Northern had concluded to leave these ware
houses closed because of the spring wheat dis
trict In the Northwest. August recovered all
its early loss and following up Its advantage
climbed to 83Hc On the bulge there was the
usual profit-taking, but the market closed
strong, August ITic over yesterday at SS@S3Hc
July opened at 80c to 79^, gold between 7Â»%c
and SlTic. closed l%c higher at 8176 c.
Corn was rather quiet and inclined, for the
lack of other incentive, to follow wheat. There
vas considerable scattered liquidation and
some short selling. The rally in wheat sent
shortH to cover and there was a fair oash de
mand, under which " the market recovered.
August closed a. sliade up and July a shade
under yesterday. "
Oats followed wheat and corn, off early, re- j
covering later and closing at the top. August j
closed KiiMc lower and July %c depressed. |
Provisions were weak early and firm later,
presumably affected to a degTee by the actions
of wheat. The changes In the course of the
market might also be ascribed to the workings
of. two packing interests. September pork
. closed 17',4c over yesterday, lard unchanged and
ribs Ec higher.

NEW YORK, June 29. â Bradstreet'e to-mor
row will say: Distributive trade Is dull, sea
sonably so In most instances, and prices of
manufactured products are generally weak, but
exceptions to the former are found where crop
conditions are exceptionally promising and In
the case of prices where the readjusting move
ment has been overdone on the down side.
The uptvard rush of wheat prices culminated
at the close of last week and the reactions
and irregularities since, mainly due to heavy
realizing, would mainly point to the movement
having been ( temporarily at least overdone.
Reports of rain in the Northwest, though it is
claimed too late to help the crop In Minnesota
and the two Dakotas, have had some reassur
ing effect and second thought apparently in
clines bears to the belief that the late ad-
Vance discounted much of the expected or pre
dicted shortage In yield of the world's crop.
Advices from the north are of little more than
half a crop of tv-heat. but estimates as to the
out-turn In bushels vary accordingly asfthe
Government report of 1G0.000.000 bushels or the
commercial estimate of 200,000,000 bushels in
yield last year in the three States are used
as a basis. A short-lived scare on the reports
of dry weather in the corn belt, sympathy with
the early advance in wheat and. what is more
Important, apparently increased popularity of
corn on export account, was responsible for
this cereal reaching the hlphest point paid for
a year past. Oats and other farm crops also
sympathized, as did most hog products. Uut
ter is higher on smaller receipts. Sugar Is at
the highest price reached at this time for ten
jears last, owing to active canning demand
and the strengthened position of raw. The war
in China is chargeable with the advance in
teas, not only from the former country but
from Japan.' some interruption In transporta
tion being apparently looked for if the Asiatic
trouble increases. Heavy rains are complained
of in the entire cotton belt, east of the Mis
sissippi and the crop is very generally "In
the. grass." The result has been an advance
of half a cent on spot. Increased cost of the
raw material is not balanced by an advance in
finished products. The contrary is the case,
because print cloths are Uc off and prints are
half a cent lower per yard.
Reports from the iron and steel trade are
as Â¦ pessimistic as ' ever. Nominally quotations
at Pittsburg are unchanged, but it is claimed
buyers can get supplies from $1 to S3 lower.
At other markets pig iron and bars among
finished products are unquestionably lower. A
comparison of present prices with those of a
year ago chow that pig iron Is little above
last year, while steel billets, bars and plates
are all lower. The reduction in structural ma
terial has brought r little new business. The
lead market is apparently an example of the
readjusting of prices having been overdone,
because It is now steady after two advances
from the low point reached some weeks ago.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.184.144 bushels, agaln&t 4.645.
180 bushels last week, 3,268,998 bushels In the
corresponding week of last year, 4.716J01
bushels in IS9B, 2.775.548 bushels in 1597, and
2.601.096 bushels In 1596.
Failures for .the week number ISS, as com
pared with 167 last wpek, 158 In this week a
year ago, IS3 in ISSS, 225 In 1697 and 223 in 1596.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada number
IS. as compared with 28 last week, 23 in this
week a year ago, 22 in IS9B, S3 in 1597 and 25
in 1596.
Dun's Review of Trade.
Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, June 29.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: No great change
has taken place in the character of current
stock speculation. The market has continued
to be a Â¦ highly professional one and the ten
dency of prices for the week may be explained
by saying that traders continued to sell stocks
down early In the week on the bad crop news
from the Northwest and South and later on
covered their short contracts extensively, there
by causing a recovery in quotations. A cir
cumstance which helped the market was the
disappearance of acute fears on the part of the
foreign markets that the Chinese troubles might
lead to. a friction between the powers, and
though London of course, paid much attention
to the developments In China, they ceased to
be the leading speculative influences. -The eas
ing of the Berlin money market and the ap
parent end of the fears of stock market col
lapse there also has had a very good effect and
German sales of American stocks in London
having ceased, our securities tended to advance
there, although the foreign interest in our mar
ket is still small. The decline of exchange
rates and dismissal of fears of future gold ex
ports, together with the ease of the New York
money market, have, of course, been factors in
sustaining prices.

the quotation current two weeks ago, and Just
before the dose sold at" 10 cents amid Intense
excitement and bull enthusiasm. August fol
lowed with a jump to 961, making the advance
of that option within two weeks 120 points.
Strong late cables, unfavorable crop news and
reported further rains" In Alabama, Tennessee
and Oorgia contributed to this advance.

bia, 9153 tons; two from jf\i?irn\la. 6174 tons;
one from Oregon. 450 tons; one from Japan,
2500 tons; total. 42.387 tons. The liberal de
liveries this week from Washington and other
sections will aid Importers in fulfilling: their
contracts, on some of which there have been
serious delinquencies. Another steamer has
been chartered for twelve months to transport
British Columbia coals, which will be of serv
ice to keep our urgent requirements supplied.
As the Alaska demand has been taken care of.
It is reasonable to suppose that shipments to
us direct will be materially Increased. Prices
"remain firm, and there is an assurance that
there can be no decline for at least twelve
months, as charters have been effected this
week for transporting coal here from Austra
lia at extreme figures, and the vessels cannot
arrive at their loading ports for fully ten
months. Furthermore, the schedule of prices
for 1901 in Australia has been advanced In
some cases 50 cents per ton. The selling quo
tations now and for next year will be made by
the colliery proprietors of Washington and
British Columbia, as they have absolute sway
locally. Large fuel consumers may well feel
grateful to those controlling the market localiy.

markedly for fully a year past if they had
desired to advance. values."

Council Adopts Resolution Postponing
the Reception Until After the ,
Fall of the Government."
PARIS, June 29.â There was a stormy
session of the Paris Municipal Council to
day growing out of the discussion of the
refusal of the Minister of War, General
Andre, to allow Colonel Marchand of
Fashoda fame to accept the Council's In
vitation to attend an official reception at
the town hall, on the ground that no offi
cer in active service can participate in a
political demonstration.
The Nationalist speakers delivered vig
orous protests against the Minister's de
cision, to which the Socialists responded
in an equally warm manner.
After ji greit tumult the Council finally
adopted a Nationalist motion protesting
against the Government's refusal to allow
the proposed reception to be held and
continuing its invitation, of which the
execution was only postponed until "after
the fall of the Government," and "the
communication of this order of the day to
Major Marchand."

NATIONALISTS DENOUNCE
GENERAL ANDRE'S ORDER
San Francisco Labor Council Takes
Issue With Murray & Ready's
Help Circular.
Regarding the reports of the scarcity of*
unskilled labor in California which hnd
been circulated throughout Eastern cities
by Murray & Ready, employment agents
in this city, the San Francisco Labor
Council comes forward with a denial of
the statements made. The committee to
whom was referred the drafting of a re
ply reported the following:
' The true conditions of labor in California are
th<?*e: Employers of labor, provided they are
willing to pay the current rates for common
labor, SI 23 to $1 7a per day. can procure all the
workmen they desire. A> rate of Jl 25 to |1 75
per day msy sound high wages to gome work
ers in the Kastern States, but let them renT-m
ber that out of this amount tne workman ha* to
house, feed and clothe himself, and that tn the
West Western prices prevail for all necessaries
of life. Wages of labor. East, West, South or
North, throughout our country, if measurM by
the amount of necessaries they buy. will b*
found to be very nearly equal. So far from
lacking help, the employers of California are
discharging in evrr-increaslng numbers white
men and women and filling their places with
Japanese and Chinese. The influx of the for
mer has of late assumed such alarming pro
portions that white labor throughout the Pacific
Coast States Is loudly demanding an exclusloft
law. So much for what is called common labor.
Wages of mechanics are also about the cam? i
as in other parts of the country, and there ara
always enougK Idle men around to fill vaean-
OrÃanized labor of California earnestly urges
upon you to give these facts as much publicity
as the letter of Murray & Ready, * 'employ r
ment arents."

In for consideration, and in passing a pet
of resolutions the following were among
those adopted:
Resolved, By the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil that we Indorse the demands of the Ftrret
Railway Men's Union, and commend its will
ingness to abide the result of arbitration; fur-
Resolved. That we condemn the St. Louis
Transit Company for its arrogant attitud*
toward its employes and place upon It thÂ« full
responsibility for the public disorder anl the
destruction of lives and property that have en
sued from Its action; further.
Resolved, That we charge, on evidence cir
cumstantial and direct, that the St. I^ouls
Transit Company Is responsible for offenses
against the law and the public well-belnp.
Resolved, That these and other Incidents of
the strike are but a repetition in aggravated
form of the methods usually adopted by cor
porate capital In its warfare upon the riÂ»?ht or
labor to organize for self-protection; and fur
ther, r-; ...
Resolved, That we therefore sympathize with
the Street Railway Men's fnlon In Its deter
mined stand in th? cause of its own and the
Keneral welfare, and pledge to it our utmost
moral and financial assistance; further.
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to the unions of this city, to the
Street Hallway Men's Union of St. I^ouis. Mo.,
and submitted to the press, with the request
for publication. Be it further
Resolved, That if the Transit Company does
not treat its workmen as American workmen
should be treated, we recommend that the peo
ple of St. Ix>u!s own "and operate their rail

Neill that in fiity*** organized labor alone

The Republican County Committee's
plan of club organization in each Assem
bly district is haVing a fair test. The en
rollment of Republican voters as a pre
liminary step toward the formation of an
official club In each district began under
orderly and favorable auspices last Satur
da3 - evening and has since been conducted
in commendable form. The rolls in each
Assembly district will be open this even
ing for Fisuatures. All Republicans who
have not enrolled should sign to-night, be
cause the rolls will be closed for a few
days in order to afford opportunity for
Inspection. The next important step in
the process of organization will be the
election on July 9of club officers. It is
essential to the welfare of the Republican
party and to the cause of good local gov
ernment that the club officers shall be
men of character and intelligence. Round
ers, race track touts, saloon loafers and
railroad hirelings will jump in and en
deavor to gain control of the clubs If the
decent men of the party are not on guard
on the evening of July 9. Every enrolled
Republican will be permitted to vote for
cluh officers on that night. Those who
are not enrolled cannot participate In the
election.
In view of these facts the Importance
of enrollment this evening is obvious.
After the permanent organization is ef
fected enrollment will be resumed and ef
forts will then be made to persuade every
Republican voter in the city to join a club
and use every honorable effort to elect
decent men as delegates to the nomi
nating conventions.
The rounders and riff-raff that hang
around grog shops and do the bidding of
degraded bosses will not put up a straight
ticket of delegates to be voted for at the
primary election on August 14, but will
rely on their own cunning and the dull
ness of better citizens to get some of their
agents nominated In each district. The
merchants, worklngmen and property
nwnors In each district can control the sit
uation if they will go to the front at this
time and nominate decent men to serve as
delegate?. No proxies can be used. The
election law docs not permit a delegate
to appoint any one to serve in his place.
The law makes it easy for people who
work for a living and pay taxes to win
out.
The Bolls Will Close To-Night and
Remain Closed Until Permanent
Club Organizations Have
Been Effected.
Republicans Should Partici
pate in Election of Club
Officers.

munication from Woodland Parlor an
nouncing that it will turn out 150 members
in uniforms of light blue with white hats,
white belts and white overshoes. It will be
preceded by its own band of eighteen
pieces. M. C. Kiefer has been appointed
aid to the grand marshal.
Las Posltas Parlor of Livermore has'ap
pointed a committee, to make all arrange
ments to be in line. It will adopt a spe
cial uniform and will parade forty men
unless the National Guard should be or
dered out, in which event llfteen members
of the parlor will have to turn out with
the soldiers.
Stanford Parlor No. 7ti announces that
it will make a line showing, having made
arrangements for uniforms and special
features. The parlor has secured head
quarters and will do the grand in the way
of entertainment.
Charles H. Stanyan and M. Miller of the
special committee on flcats held an Infor
mal meeting yesterday afternoon to con
sider designs lor iluacs. A. number ot sug
gestions were offered, among the number
oeing tne following: The outer and inner
telegraph stations. Point Lobos and Tele
grapn riill,' announcing the arrival ol the
Oregon 'with the news of the admission of
Camornia into the Union; "the Oregon
entering the Golden Gate decorated from
stem to stern and from trucK to taffrail ";
"the pioneer schoolhouse on Portsmouth
Square"; "the mining Industry, represent
ing the primitive method of mining with
arastra, mining with pan, rocker and
sluices, and mining with quartz crusher;"
"the Union, represented by forty-lour
boys of uniform size, who will typliy the
manhood of the Union, with a Native
Daughter to represent California, the
thirty-ttrst State." Drawings expressing
these ideas will be prepared and submit
ted at the next meeting of the committee.
This committee is anxious that any one
having* suggestions for Moats will send
such suggestions to headquarters In the
Palace Hotel.
There was a large attendance of the
members of the Native Sons 1 general com
mittee of the seml-centenniai celebration
of Admission day last evening. First Vied
President F. 11. Dunne in the chair.
R. H. Morse was seated as a delegate
from California Parlor, vice James J.
Jamison, deceased.
The committee on badges reported in
favor of a white satin badge with gold
fringe, with the words "Joint Committee,"
surmounted by a bear.' There will be a
pendent star with the year 1900. On each
will be the title of the committee on
which the wearer Is serving. The report
was adopted.
The committee on local transportation
reported having received a satisfactory
proposition from carrfage owners.
. The Illumination ana decoration com
mittee presented a progress report.
The committee on entertainment pre
sented a report similar to the one offered
at the previous meeting, but it was sug
gested that It was too early to adopt as
linal a definite line of entertainment, so
action In the matter was deferred.
The finance committee reported that
everything is moving along favorably and
there is every prospect ot success in se
curing contributions.
The committee on hotels and accommo
dations announced that it will send out a
circular asking for Information in regard
to what accommodations can be secured.
R. Steinman was added to the committee.
The music committee reported that It
had called on the two musicians' unions
and that each had announced that there
would be no objection in relation to union
and non-union bands appearing In line.
The committee will make a report as soon
as it can ascertain what music shall be
required.
The report of the naval parade commit
tee, which has already been published in
The Call, was received as progressive.
The report of the committee on parade,
which has also been published, was ac
cepted. It was decided that the parade
be held on the 10th.
Fred W. Lees, delegate from Yerba
Buena Parlor, asked if the parade com
mittee had selected its grand marshal of
the 9th of September celebration.
Chairman Dunne remarked that the re
marks were unintelligible.
Mr. Lees said that he was not responsi
ble for the chairman's inability to under
stand plain language, but that the consti
tution provided for the duties of the
grand marshal of the Grand Parlor.
"Mr. Lees." said the chairman, "the
chair is willing to be advised even by
you."
Grand- Secretary Lunstedt suggested
that possibly Steve V. Costello had as a
member of the parade committee appoint
ed himself. This idea seemed to prevail
and no action was taken on Mr. Lees*
suggestion.
The committee on Pioneers reported
that invitations had been sent to the Cal
ifornia Pioneers, Sail Joaquln Pioneers,
Sacramento Pioneers. Marysville Pio
neers. El Dorado Pioneers, Santa Cruz
Pioneers, Santa Clara County Pioneers,
Placer County Pioneers and all California
Pioneer societies existing in the East.
The design adopted by the printing com
mittee is a reproduction of the design of
the Native Sons' statue on Market street,
with a background of palms; .back ot
these Is a view of the Golden Gate with a
setting sun: at the foot of the statue ara
the bear and municipal flags and a bear
and woman and little angels. The design
bears the words "Semi-Centennial Admis
sion Day Celebration. ISSO-1900." This was
; adopted as the desipn of the joint eom
i mittees. i
The committee on rules and regulations
presented a lengthy report defining the
duty of each committee. It was adopted.
J. J. Lrerman moved that the portraits
in the souvenir of the celebration shall bft
of uniform size and of uniform price. The
motion was lost.

PLANNING FOR
THE JUBILEE
CELEBRATION
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, June 23.
While walking in his sleep A. E. Cubitt.
a well-known resident of Livermore. was
nearly killed last nisht by stepping out of
a second story window, falling twenty
feet to the ground.
The unfortunate somnambulist was
found beneath the window unconscious
from his fall, but. strangely enough, suf
fering from no serious external injuries.
Other than cuts and bruises Cubitt es
caped almost miraculously. The fall was*
a sheer drop, with nothing to break ita
force. He had landed In a parden patch
in front of his residence, and it may hava
been that the soft, yielding earth upon
which he struck saved htm from broken
limbs or a fractured skull.
The suffering sleepwalker was soon pro
nounced in no danger, for he regained
his senses speedily, although there was
considerable, nervous shock. Of course.
Cubitt had no idea how the accident oc
curred, as his last recollection was when
he retired early during the evening.
For years Cubitt has been a sleep
walker. In fact, the habit was upon htm
even In his childhood. But In all of his
nocturnal peregrinations he had never
before suffered harm. Fully aware of his
affliction, he had always taken precau
tions against the occurrence of accidents
In hl3 sleepwalking experiences. On this
occasion, however, he nad loft a window
open when he went to bed because of the
heat of the room, and it -was this which
led to his fall.
Cubitt is a professional nurse and much
of his time he is awake all night in at
tendance upon patients. It does not ap
pear that during his sleep In the day tKne
the habit overcomes him. While there is
no apparent permanent Injury to the
young man, the accident will cause him to
double his precautions against its recur
rence.
Cubitt enjoys excellent health an<! a
sound physique, but all efforts to break
down the habit have failed.
Picked Up In an Unconscious Condi
tion and Borne to His Apart
ments â Cannot Explain
â¢ Accident.

Members of the Grand Jury will be
called upon to-da^y to Investigate the
charge against Asa H. King and "William
Hale to , the effect that they endeavored
to wrest $100 from Frank Multner, the
Richmond district real estate dealer, as
compensation for services rendered in
promising to return a wallet Multner ac
cidentally left In a small room In the
Flood building. King is well connected In
this city and Hale for several years paÃt
has been either directly or indirectly con
nected with one or the other of the many
record searching firms of the city.
Multner made a sworn statement yester
day which will be submitted to the Grand
Jury for its consideration to-day. This
statement contains a complete history of
the loss of the wallet In question and the
subsequent deal with King and Hale that
may mean serious trouble for them; The
statement reads:
â¢ SAN FRANCISCO. June 26. 1900.
To the Honorable Grand Jury. .San Francisco,
Cal.â Gentlemen: On the 13th of November,
1599. I lost a leather wallet with my name and
address written on the inside cover and'con
taining deeds, papers and letters, all of a per
sonal nature and only valuable to myself. The
wallet was left by me In one of the small rooms
In the Flood building. Two days later I in
serted an advertisement In the local papers ex
plaining my loss and offering a nominal reward
tor the return of the wallet. Four months
later, in March. 19C0, Asa H. King called at
my residence, 77 Ninth street, and wanted to
know whether or not I Â¦ had lost any valuable
papers. 1 told Sir. King that I had and he
thereupon stated that he knew where they were
and upon payment by me of $100 he would
cause them to be returned to me. as there were
three of them In It, and the amount would have
to be divided. I told him that I had no money,
but would have some In a week or so. He then
said that he would calljit that time. He did
not keep his engagement, so I then called upon
William Hale and left word that I would like
tÂ» see Mr. King. In the meantime I called on
the District Attorney and laid the case before
him and he referred me to the Chief of Police.
After stating my case to that gentleman he
detailed two detectives, Mr. Silvey and Mr.
Â£gan, and upon their advice I had Mr. King
call at my home while they were in an ad
joining room so that they might hear any con
versation that passed between Mr. King and
myself. Mr. King called and he bargained
with me that he wwuld have the wallet return
ed to me If I would meet him at the Occidental
Hotel the next day and bring ?50 with me for
its redemption. I then knocked on the door
and the detective* came In and took Mr. King
to the City Prison and questioned him as to
the whereabouts of the wallet. Mr. King would
not give them any information and they then
locked him up. He then told them that Wil
liam Hale had the wallet. Mr. Egan called
upon Mr. Hale, but he would not deliver up the
wallet until after I swore out a search war
rant, which I did the next day. Under the ad
vice of the Police Department I swore out a
warrant charging both Mr. Hale and Mr. King
with extortion, and they were tried before
Judge Â¦ Cabanas and acquitted upon a techni
cality. This was all done upon the advice of
the Police Department. Since then Mr. King
sued me for 1299 for false Imprisonment and
obtained Judgment for that amount and costs.
The case was tried before Justice of the Peace
Cook. I present these facts for consideration
by your honorable Jury, as I wish to have
Justice done me. Respectfully submttted. -
FRANK MULTNER.
Though a judgment was rendered
against Multner in the Justices Gpurt, he
will probably seek to have It reversed on
appeal. In the meantime he will urive hla
attention to the prosecution of ,the*Â»men
who found his wallet. Â»B?s&Â§i

Lord â¢ Francis Hope, brother of the
present Earl of HopÂ«toun. and his wife,
who was formerly May Yohe. the Amer
ican burlesque actress, arrived from Aus
tralia on the steamer Moana yesterday
and aTe at the Palace Hotel. They are
making a tour of the world for plesure.
Coming here from Sydney, an infected
port, they were detained on board the
steamer all: day until their -baggage had
been fumigated and it was so late when
they reached the hotel that they decline**
to be Interviewed, pleading fatigue.
It <Â¦ was currently reported a few
months ago that Lord Hope had been in
duced by his relatives to leave his beau
tiful wife in order that she might be deÂ»
prlved of the right to share his prospec
live title of Duke of Newcastle, but there
seems to have been nothing in the rumor.
Fellow passengers of the couple say that
they were as attentive to each other as
brlae and groom.
They proved to be the pleasantest of
traveling companions, entering into the
amusements aooard ship during the long
voyage with great zest and making it
pleasant for every one. Lord Hope made
a speech at an entertainment during the
last evening at sea In which he praised
the American people.
When Lady Hope was May "iohe she
was one of the best known actresses on
the Â¦ American stage. Her mother was a
dressmaker, and her> birthplace Bethle
hem, Pa. She exhibited talent at an early
age. and friends sent her to Europe that
she might cultivate her voice and learn
to speak foreign languages. She learned
the languages, but did not pay much at
tention to cultivating her. voice, satisfied
that being the possessor of three or four
remarkably rich low notes - she could
make a sensation. She was right, for
from the time of her debut In the Temple
Theater, Philadelphia, which has since
been burned; she became a favorite. In
1887 she made a tremendous success in
David Henderson's Chicago Opera-house
as Prince Pretty wltz in "Crystal Slipper."
Afterward she appeared in "Natural Gas"
and "U and I." -..-.. .
â A few years ago she appeared for a.
short engagement in this city, at which
time T. H. Williams, the horseman, was
one of her ardent admirers. About that
time her marriage was reported, but sub
sequently denied.'.. -
Lord Hope met his wife in London,
where she became a great favorite in
comic opera, and a short time afterward
their engagement was announced, in Au
gust. 1593. They were married in Novem
ber, 1894. Lord Hope bears the title of
Lord only by courtesy. The family is onÂ©
of. the oldest and most respected in Eng
land. â¢â¢ - Â¦-?

of age, was dragged out of bed at his
parents' residence, 2734 Howard street, by
, Policemen E. Koblnson and A. Bchmldt
Thursday night and taken to the Seven
teenth-street station against his mother's
protest. She declared that If anything
was wrong she would be responsible for
his appearance in court, but the police
would not listen to her. The boy was
placed on the detinue book at the station
and later was taken to the City Prison,
where he was placed in "the tanks." Yes
terday morning a charge of burglary was
booked against him, but he was almost
immediately released on $300 bonds* ac
cepted by Judge Mogan. His sureties were
his mother and John D. Whaley of the
Parrott building. â¢
William Herbing, contractor and builder,
2710 Folsom street, complained to Corporal
Heggerty at the Seventeenth-street sta
tion Thursday that the basement of his
house had been entered and a number of
brass door hinges and other articles of
the value of $50 had been stolen. Hegger
ty detailed Robinson and Schmidt. on the
case and they found that a boy answering
Nelson's description had sold some hinges
to Thomas H. Wagstaff. proprietor of the
Mission Brass Works/375 Sanchez street.
They called upon Wagstaff and he said
that the, boy had given his proper name
and address and explained his possession
of the hinges by the fact that his father
owned a hardware store. Then followed
the boy's arrest and he was identified by
Wagstaff. â¢ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦-. . . ..-,
Mrs. Nelson went to the station and re
newed her offer* to give bonds for the
boy's appearance, as she and her husband
owned* the place where . they lived and
other property.but she says she was curt
ly Hold that she might be .arrested for
compounding a felony. She: went to her
friend, John D.'Whaley, but wbx>n they
got to the station they -were- told that
the boy had been sent to the City Prison.
They went there, but in accordance with
the rule that no information be given
about prisoners in "tho tanks" they were
informed that no such person was there.
They hired a hack and drove to some of
the outside stations, making Inquiry for
the boy and gave up their quest about 2
o'clock yesterday morning.
The boy did not deny that he sold the
hinges to Wagstaff, but said he got them
from another boy. 18 years of age, on the
promise that if he cold them he would
get .enough money to buy firecrackers for
the Fourth. He gave the boy's name to
the police, buC no effort was made to ar
rest him. Mrs. Nelson and her husband,
who is nearly 80 years of age, are indig
nant at the way their son has been treat
ed. They intend to have the case inves

porting him was Mr. Gilbert, who was
evidently Intended for Solomon LÂ«evl of
Easy street. Kachel did not "come out"
in. response to Mr.' Cashman's Impas
sioned serenade, but that was not on ac
count of the quality of the serenade
(which was good), but rather, I think, be
cause she feared she would be struck
blind if she allowed herself to gaze upon
those plum-colored trousers in the -.rull
glare of the calcium. Ferris Hartman
sustained most of the excellent'fooling in
the sallies between interlocutor and ends;
his topical song, "A Little Bit Off the
Top," made a hit, as usual. Messrs.'Gil
bert and Goldle showed In their specialty
an: unusual excellence: of method;;. their
directness,' clearness and emphasis ' could
not- be Improved upon for the knock-a-
Joke-into-your-head style of dialogue at
which they aim. Mr. Morrison recited
"My Uncle" with good emphasis, but
with some pronunciations entirely his
own; thus, mcc for my, rot for. wrought,
curtin for curtain. Miss Marble gave two
of her Inimitable little songs parodying
the half-grown girl. Miss Etta Butler pro
vided the most artistic treat of the after
noon in her imitations of-Fougere, Olga
Nethersole, Mrs. Fiske and Edna May;
her imitation of Anna Held might well be
dropped from her repertoireifor two rea
sons â first. Anna Held has no art. but
only Impudence; second, the very- thought
of a woman drunk is disgusting and the
representation of it is worse. â¢ Henry Mil
ler, though announced, did not appear,
much to the regret of many in the audi
ence.
The programme comprised many more
items than those enumerated, but lack of
space has forbidden mention of any but
the most interesting. â¢

â¢was one which will long.be remembered
and which will occupy a niche in the his
tory of the charitable deeds of the people
of San. Francisco.
More than 10,000 tickets were sold, and,
as was stated in these columns a few,
days ago, the seats for the benefit per
formance were disposed of In Â¦ less Â¦ than
an hour and a half. Those who were un
able to exchange . their tickets for . re
served seat coupons were contented to
stand in line for hours for the . oppor
tunity of gaining admittance, while hun
dreds of others, seeing the uselessness of
their quest, either turned back or re
mained away altogether. -^ v.t ' .- *
Police Do Good Work.
At 10 o'clock In the morning a long line
extending from the entrance of the thea
ter to Fourth street was formed, and the
police, under Captain Spillane, were kept
busy answering questions and -keeping
the eager ones in check. The curtain was
scheduled to rise at. 1:30 p. m., and an
hour before that time the' theater was
comfortably filled. Owing to. the excellent
work of Captain Spillane and his squad
of eighty-five policemen there was little
crowding and no accidehts. When the
gallery door was opened. at noon the po
lice allowed 500 people to ascend. the stair
way in bunches of five, and when that
high place .was. filled _np more were al
lowed to go up. Police officers, under
their respective sergeants,, were stationed
at the various landings to prevent acci
dents. Two Bcore of ttremen, dressed in
their neat â¢ uniforms, ' were stationed ., in
every, part of the theater, and acted .as
ushers. They were under- the supervis
ion of Second Assistant Chief Shaugh
nessy,: and gave excellent assistance to
the regular ushers of the theater. . ,
When the coupon-holders .were seated
the other ticket-holders - were â¢ permitted
to enter and line themselves against -the
walls and in the aisles ' of the first and
second floors. ' ' I ..'1.;.,
Chief Sullivan, Assistant , Chief Dough
erty. Setwnd Assistant- Chief Shaugh
nessy. District Engineer Fernandez md
other heads of the department -occupied
a box to the left of the stage. Ever alive
to their duty these ilre-flghters were
called-away for a short time to save prop
erty at the Olympic Club. A "tapper" In
a room adjoining the stage, watched over
by Operatives Chris F. Ward and Thomas
Muldowney. rang out box 371 twice, and
the fire laddies had to leave. They took
their departure so quietly that few in the
audience knew there was a . fire In * â¢ the
city. In 'an adjoining boxÂ« was pretty
Edna Wallace Hopper, who is summerin?
in California, and a party of friends,, and
in the boxes opposite were Mrs.^Marcus
M. Hecht and family and John P. Dunne
of the Mathews &. Bulger Company/and
their friends.
Four Hundred Soldiers Present.
Through the generosity of Mrs., A. "8.
Townsend 400 soldiers attended the per
formance. They occupied seats In the
dress circle - and made a martial (appear
ance. The wounded lately returned from
Manila, convalescents in khaki . and boys
In blue were there and enjoyed' the hos
pitality of their benefactress. The actual
amount of money In the house, according
to the statement of the managers, ww
$3323. It is believed that fully^7ooo will be
realized from the benefit. â¢ Â¦
The programme was r carried through
Â¦without a hitch. From the time the cur
tain arose on the first part until the last
number was presented the audience was
treated to sweet singing, -, graceful danc
ing and clever specialties.- An â¢Â¦ Introduc
tory overture, entitled "The Fireman's
March," by Charles Bchultz, : was , played
by a combined; orchestra,. which was un
der the direction of B. Jaulus oftheOr
pheum. O. A. Mayhood of the Â¦ California
and A. Loda of the - Alcazar. Then - f ol-
. For what can a man <Jo nobler than
lay down his life for a friend.
CT\ HAT such a sacrifice in the cause
| of humanity is appreciated by Cali
Â¦ â¢ fornians and San Franciscans in
I particular was evidenced by the tre-
JL mendous crowds which poured into
the Grand Opera-house yesterday after
noon. By their presence the people of
this city and vicinity desired to express
their high' esteem for John Edward Swee
ney, the gallant fireman who lost his. life
In the discharge of his duty, and to swell
the fund that" will keep his widow and or
phans from want. . Talented artists had
volunteered their services In the noble
cause and 'won the plaudits of the vast
.audience that packed the big theater to
the limit of its capacity by their special
ties and splendid acting. The occasion
lowed the following programme:

The (j\
talking
THE
Zon-o- phone
is the highest type - of talking
machine that there is, as it is an
improvement on the Gram-o-
j>hone, which, as every one
knows, was the finest machine
in existence.
The Zon-o-phone's tones are
clear, distinct and natural. Its
reproduction is so wonderful
lhat a person hardly realizes
that it is a. mere machine doing
the talking.
The works are incased in a
handsome, piano-finished oak
case, with bevel-plate glass
sides md pillared corners.
Price, V $25. Records 50c each
Everybody is invited to -call
2nd hear the Zon-o-phone,
whether or not ... they wish to
"purchase. It -is constantly on
