New York's 72 votes

liver will, judging from
the positive declarations
made by delegates, prob
ably poll more than 160
votes on the first ballot.
Indiana's vote will be
cast for Fairbanks, and
he will receive some scat
tering votes.
The strength of the opposition
to. the administration's candidate
cannot be estimated with any de
gree of . accuracy. Many dele
gates who would have voted for
Roosevelt are now convinced
that he is determined not to ac
cept the nomination. It is prob
able that Long's lead will cause
many wavering delegations to
jump into his bandwagon, and it
is reasonably probable that he
will be nominated on the first bal
lot, but if there is a sharp or pro
longed contest Dolliver will stand
an excellent chance. There are
yet many stubborn ones who de
clare that their beloved Rough
Rider will be nominated nolens
volens by a stampede.

of the Navy in the new Cabinet.
. Previous to the action of the
New York delegation to-night a
poll of the convention had been
made by The Gall's representa
tives, but of course it must be
modified before it can be accept
ed as reliable. Some changes are
made in it, and it is herewith pre
sented for what it is worth. It
will at least show that the Vice
Presidential fight is a very pretty
one:
It seems that the ad
ministration is sure of the
following States for Long:
Alabama. 22; Arkansas.

ROOSEVELT CONSIDERS HIMSELF
OUT OF THE RACE
wffich way the cat ; will jump.
Several members said to-night
that this was equivalent to a dec
laration for the administration's
candidate, John D. Long of Mas
sachusetts, for they believe the
administration will beat Quay
and Platt. But should it appear
that Hanna is very likely to be
defeated, the California men may
desert the administration's stand
ard, for, as one member said to
night, "It is quite natural for us
to want to be on the winning
side, but almost the entire dele
gation are of the opinion that
Long will be nominated, there
fore their votes may safely be re-
"HENRY T. ; SCOTT." <
Galifornians regard this as a
suggestion of Mr. Scott that pos
sibly his brother might 'stand -a
"If the California delegation
would vote for Irving M. Scott
no harm would be done and much
good might result, for California
might then be recognized by a
representative in the .Cabinet.'
T., has been .bombarding the
members of the California delega
tion with' telegrams urging that
California's eighteen votes * be
cast for Irving' M . \ as a ; compli
ment. Following is the substance
of . a telegram received : by Dele-
If the vote was not likely to be
close between the administration
and anti-administration forces,
Irving M. Scott might receive
eighteen complimentary votes,
but the Californians do not wish
to: waste, their efforts on a hope
less candidacy, although they all
unite in expressing. great respect
for the noted ship-builder. It ap
pears -that/Mr.; Scott is a willing
"Barkis," for his brother, Henry
corded for Long on the first bal
lot unless there is a great change
in the situation between now and
Thursday."
SCOTT'S MEN ACTIVE.
The question is, Can Hanna
muster enough votes to nominate
Long on the first ballot? The
solid South, with the exception of
one or two States, will vote for
any candidate espousecl^by the ad
ministration, and many other
States are only awaiting a. tip
from the McKinley forces before
announcing their attitude. This
is true of California's delegation,
despite all reports to the con
trary. There were rumors all
day around the Walton Hotel
lobby that the Californians would
be found "fighting in the front
rank for Roosevelt, and some re
ports had it that a Californian
would make the nominating
speech . for Roosevelt. Various
polls have been made and each
one has put California's eighteen
votes in the Roosevelt column,
but The Gall correspondent has
definite and reliable information
that the Californians will not de
cide how to vote until they see

PHIA, June 19. â All convention
speculation was completely up
set at midnight to-night, and all
calculations turned awry by
Roosevelt's positive and final re
fusal to take the Vice Presiden

delegation went into caucus and
decided to present Woodruff's
name, which will insure the Lieu

the seventy-two votes of the Em

be about the limit of his" strength,
and it is generally conceded that
he has no chance whatever
of winning. The administration
is determined to nominate Long,
but the Quay and Platt crowd de

Again Mr. Hanna was the center of at.

in a clear voice began his speech of wel

SENATOR HANNA'S SPEECH.
Gentlemen of the convention: In bidding you
welcome, v I â¢ also,, desire â¢ to extend congratula
tions upon thl? magnificent gathering 'of repre
sentatives of thÂ© gTeat Republican party.- <Ap
plaute.) The national committee nmde no mis
take when' they brought the national convention
to the city of â¢ 1'hlladelpha. (Applause. This

magnificent industrial center, a veritable bee

be presented to those of us/who have gath

(Applause.) <ThlÂ« city that has long and al
ways been known the country over for its un
bounded hospitality (applause) and the superb
management of all great functions which have
come -within Its limits. On the .part of the
national committee I desire to extend their
sincere thunks to the people of Philadelphia,
and especially to your honorable Mayor (ap
plause) and the loyal citizens without 'regard
to rÂ«rty who have labored with him to make
this convention a success. Never In the history
of conventions of either political party has a
success been greater.
Delegates. J greet you on the anniversary in
Philadelphia of our first party. (Applause.) I
need not remind you that your duty here Is one
of deliberate Judrment, . onÂ« that you are held
responsible- for . not one by country but of
the country. We arc come together once more
on the eve of a great struggle.
We are now begnnlng to form our battalion
under Uie leaders*.'!? of our great statesman.
General William McKinley. (Continued ap
plause.) I was about to give the order for
those battalions to move, but you interrupted
me. (Laughter?) It needs no order to Republi

fit in front of me. to 'tell them what is their
duty. Upon the foundation of our party rests
the belief and strength ot every member <.f it
Before I lay aside my gavel and retire from
the position which I have held as chairman
of the national committee for four years I de
sire, in this presence, in the most public man
ner, to return my sincere thanks to every
member of this splendid committee who stood
by me In the struggle of 1Â£9G. and especially to
that coterie who gathered at the headquarters
In New York and Chicago and worked from"
early morninjr until late at night for the prin
ciples of the Republican party and for the
welfare of the csuntry. I leave it In the handa
of others- to tell you what that means but
in passing to others these duties I want to
make the suggestion to always trust the peo
ple (applause) and leave as an inheritance to
them the motto of the committee of 1396- "There
Is no such word as fail."
Â¦ And now,' gentlemen, it becomes my duty
and, very great pleasure, to present to you as
temporary chairman. Senator Wolcott of Colo
rado. :^to(Â«f8gM9M___Mi|__M|_l__M8i
Cheers 'for the President.
When the chairman said "we are on the
eve of another struggle; already we are
beginning: to form o-sr battalions under
.the leadership, of our great statesman
General William McKinley," it was the
signal, and for the first time the conven
tion broke forth in a whirlwind of enthu.
slasm. Men and women sprang to their
feet, delegates, spectators, staid and dis
tinguished guestsâ all animated by a com.
mon ; purpose to do honor Â¦ to the Presi
dent. â¢ Senator Hanna looked down with
smiling' satisfaction, on. the tempestuous
demonstration. Flags ajid handkerchiefs
waved everywhere in billows of color.
For ten seconds, twenty, thirty, a mlh
ute. the demonstration kept up, and then
with, a wave of the hand, the national
chairman begged the assemblage to re
sume-its seats and let him proceed.
- As Mr. Hanna closed his speech, ' Sena.'
tor Fairbanks, from the, first of the row
of delegates, arose and moved that thÂ«
selection- of Senator Wolcott as tempor
ary chairman be approved, ; and, with
unanimous voice, the delegates bo voted.
..The appearance of the Colorado orator
a moment later set the convention oft
like a rocket. ; He wore a blue sack suit
with a white vest. There was elasticity
In his step as he bowed low to the con
vention; and there was something about,
him which suggested his mountain home
With' a pleasant nod: of acknowledgment
to : Chairman Hanna, 'he turned : and ad
dressed the convention as follows:

Senator Hanna seemed In no hurry to
cail the convention to order. Attired in a
sack suit, with a white vest, he sat chat
tins with tnose about him. his broad .face
beaming, his eyes roving over the con
vention.
At 12:30 the band broke into the strains
of the "Star Spangled Banner." Gover
nor Roosevelt was first on his feet in
response to the national anthem. His
Rough Rider hat came off and he stood
with head . uncovered. Instantly the
whole convention arose en masse. Ten

wtio*e fame was sprc-aa away irom our
fchores across both oceans, entered witn
out producing a ripple. 4,'erhaps most of
Â¦them were not recognized. it seemed
lame. There was umy that indescribable
buzz' of myriads of -voices" which belongs
to a national convention as the humming
of bees belongs to a field of clover in suna
,xner, and it looked as though nothing
could galvanize itv_' thousands into liie.
iiut just before Chairman Hanna was
-ready to drop his gavel Governor PÂ»ocse
velt er.Ured and tne vast audience was
electrilied. - He stalked in at the main
Â¦door. His Rough Rider hat signaled him
out to the craning multitude. Seemingly
the audience had b*cn waiting for him
and the applause that announced his ap
jM-arance swept over the vast amphi
theater ar>.d swelled into a. great roar as
be made his way toward the peats of the
New York delegation. Senator Depew
and. Chairman Odell of the New York
Si-.te Committee were with him. but the
crowds had eyes only for the dashing hero
of San Juan.
But he made no acknowledgment of the
ovation his appearance elicited. His jaw
was firmly set and he came on through
the press like a soldier performing a duty.
Â¦Jde did not even remove his hat. but
pushed his way through the delegates,
who. swarmed from their places to grasp
his hand. Fully two minutes It took for
him to traverse the length of the hail to
hi? place near the etage. A11 that time
the roar followed him and the handker
chiefs roee and fell like the wings of gulls
over a summer sea.
He mad? no suggestion that he realized
it was all for him. When he took his
Â«<?at with his slouch hat stiJl on. without
having glanced to either 6ider the people
gave it up and the, cheering gradually
subsided. It broke out afresh a moment
afterward, as the band started up the
"Star Spangled Banner." Roosevelt of
ftll the thousands was first upon bis feet,
standing erect, like a Norway pine," with
uncovered head, to the music of the an

All Eyes Upon Roosevelt.
The* entrance of Roosevelt into the con
vention was distinctly the dramatic fea
ture of the -session. The convention, un
der the spell of his presence, could not
take its eye? off him. On him the in
terest seemed centered. During every
pause in the proceedings he was sur
rounded by delegates and newspaper men.
Enxious for a word. ,3"o all he cave the
game answer: He was not a candidate.
He did not want ,the nomination. Those
Â¦who wanted him nominated left him. say-
Ing if he would not accept they would
nominate him "whether he liked it 'or not.
Thow who did not want "him hastened to
fpuad the report that. he could not be
moved into accepting. . -
Chairman Hannah reception when he
called .'thÂ« convention to order and later
Â¦when lie made a speech was flattering
in the extreme, and ill e smile on Ills face
expressed the ploanure it gave him. But
Th* joy he experienced over his own re
ception- s-emtd - nothing: compared- with
the delight he manifested when for the
first time he mentioned the President'*
name. The convention went off like a
rocket. The applause was deafening:. MÂ».
'Hanca's face was' a picture'. It was
Â¦wreathed in smiles. He showed the ec-
Btary of the Joy he felt over the storm oÂ»
approval he had raised. Many in that
moment remembered how the President's
Warwick had announced a year ago that
Ills ambition would be satisfied and his
cup of joy would be full when he called
together the convention that would re
nominate McKinley. Perhaps It wÂ» sig.
nlflcant that in his speech Senator Planna

Martyr to Partisan Hatred.
_L noteworthy incident of the s^slon
was the remarkable demonstration to
Governor Taylor of Kentucky* That his
party associates look upon him as a rnar
iyr to partisan hatred their great ova
tion to-uay made evident. Although they
succeeded In bringing him to the platform
they could not induce him to make a
speech. ,

Gathering of the Clans.
At 1_:S5 p. m. the convention was called
to order ancl the racking excitement of
conference and caucus, of crashing bands
and contusion of hotel corridors, gave way
to the lieimiixncss of actual convention
proceccUiigs.
The day opened auspiciously for the
event. The SK.y was slightly overcast and
there was none of the sweltering of many
former national gatherings. The air was
cool, the temperature below 7u and the
indications were for good weather
throughout the ' meeting. After being up
hnif tne nlsht with the demonstration of
Â»i,000 marching men, fireworks, bands,
tinal caucuses and earnest conferences the
army of deleg;ites and the conspicuous
ngures of the convention were* slow to
make their appearance. But the staid old
Quaker city was early astir with prepara
tions, and by s o'clock the streets took
on an air ot animation and anticipation
as the crowds began to converge toward
the convention grounds.
The arrangements 'for transporting the
groat, multitude from downtown to the
great liall are admirable, many lines of
electric cars giving ready conveyance.
That splendid avenue, Broad street, leads
to the most direct route, that en South
street, and all of the early cars on this
line were crowded with people anxious to
secure points of vantage in the great
building. The crowds were good na
ture-i and intensely earnest. The ladies
showed their interest in the event by
reakliiK up "a considerable percentage of
the moving- hosts and the fair weather
permitted all the color of bright parasols
and midsummer dress to be blenaed with
the blaze of bunting.
Out at the convention grounds the of
ficials were early on hand with their corps
of doorkeepers, scrgeant-at-arms, ushers
and pages, putting them through the flnal
drilh*. According to the orders the doors
were to be opened shortly after 10 o'clock
and all the officials were to be at their
posts an hour before that time. The first
squad to put In an appearance was that
under Organizer Owen, 300 strong, having
charge of seating the delegates and spec
tators. After them came the 400 assist
ants under Sergeant-at-Arms Wlswell,
more particularly to care for the inter
ests of the delegates. Chief Doorkeeper
Ivereheval had an early drill, both at thÂ«
outer gates .and at the entrance doors.
which gave promise of an avoidance of
confusion and delay which often attends
aumis-slon to conventions.
Convention Hall Crowded!
During the early hours the Inside of the
â¢convention hall presented -the appearance
of a vast sea of pine, overhung with a
wealth vt festoon, bunting and historic
portraiture. It was very light, very airy,
and so arraneed In the gradual rise of
seats from a conrsmon center to g-lve full
opportunity for the demonstrations of en
thusiasm which were noon to come. .On
;ul hands were heard words of comm'en
dation for the admirable facilities which
the hall gava for a gathering of this char
acter.
i Out.Â«Ide of the hall the approaches began
to congest with the crowds during the
early hours: The ears added hundreds ev
ery mlnnte, and as the outer gates were
not opened until 10 o'clock, the arrivals
were massed on the walks and streets
awaiting the signal to get in.
The street venders did a ..thriving: busi
ness tn buttons and badges, and a lively
trade was carried on In seats for the con
vention at rates from $5 for ai
single session up to SCO for the, sessions.
,The crowds were slow in' gatherinir in
the convention .hall. When' shortly after
11 o'clock the band In the gallery awoke
the echoes in the vast roof -space th<=>re
were not more than 1000 persons in the
great auditorium. But it was astonishing
how rapidly the crowds began to arrive
after that hour. They poured in In steady
streams until they blackened the areas
of scats. An unusually large number were
women, looking fresh and sweet In their
summer gowns. The sergeant-at-arms and
the ushers had their hands full attending
to the crowds. In the seats back of the
stage were many distinguished person-
Ag'es. . Â¦ Â¦. - Â¦ * Â¦ # .. .
The leaders were slow in arriving, and
it was not until Senator Hanna put in an
appearance; at 11:45. that the enthusiasm
cf the thousands was uncorked. He trot

a. cheer.
Occupying prominent seats upon the
Platform were four of the fourteen men
now Jiving wha were delegates to the first
oonvvntion of the Republican party, held
in Philadelphia, Jujy 17, 1S56. All were
members of the regular Ohio delegation.
.Cornelius N. Blfss cot a scattering of
applause as he took his seat with the New
\ork; delegation, and Senator Plait was
given a popular greeting.
The crowds were soon so absorbed pick,
ing out the men. of national reputation
that they forgot to cheer, and men like
Henry Cabot Lodge . of Massachusetts.
Senator Davis of Minnesota, and Senator
Foraker of Ohio did not get a hand as.
they took their -places. Meantime the
band was playing pop'ular airs, and the
scene was impressive and animated. At
noon Senator Hanna took his seat at the
chairman's table, .but although this was
the hour set for calling the convention he
waited a few moments, conferring with
Secretary l>lck, Senator Wolcott and oth
ers. ',Â¦â¢':
At 12:07 the first pronounced demonstra

P< For"half a century the Hawaiian Islands, a
menace to the \<tx\K line- of coast whicr* slcirts
our Pacific slope, have been knocking for ad
mission as part of our territory, and durlns
that period ths publicly expressed opinion c
both political parties favored their annexation.
Four times have they been occ-pied by Euro
pean powers, and as oft-n have we compelled
their abandonment because it waÂ» essential that
they should never bo occupied by any foreign
power. Finally, after years of mlsgovernment
by native rulers, the gallant descendants or
American merchants and missionaries maae
proffer again of these valuable possessions to
this country, asking only to come under our
flag and dominion. A Democratic President
repudiated th* offer and sought to assist in
restoring the former corrupt and oppressive
ruler. It was left for this administration to
make them a part of American territory. They
are on the way to our islands In the Southern
seas: every instinct of self-protection shouH
have prompted our quick acceptance of their
sovereignty, and yet they were acquired la
spite of the bitter opposition of almost every
Democrat in Congress.
During the last administration an
offer of settlement was made to the*
Pacific railroads which would hav^
brought us $42,000,000 out of th"
$70 t 000,000 due us in principal and
interest.
President MeKlnley, refusing- to consider as
binding the former offer and acting within
the authority of Congress, collected every
dollar of both principal and Interest due from
the Union Pacific Compaxiy and the principal
of the debt due from the Kansas Paciflc. WÂ«
saved more than *3>,00O.C0O over the offer of
settlement made by Mr. Claveland and have
collected all of the orindpal and most of the
Interest due ixn. Thus was this transaction
clcred and has since been followed by a settle
ment of the debt of the Central Paciflc Rail
road, calling for every dollar of principal and
interest of the debt, amounting to $5*,000,fiOO.
More than thirty-five years ago a Republi

was to link together the "East and the West:

area to be penetrated was then unsettled and
unknown. It is now a.' great empire, rich, pros

which made the highway possible has been

Following the Path, oi Safety.
The campaign four years ago was foujfht on
thÂ« currency question. ThÂ« Popullstic Demoe
racy insisted that the United states alone
should embark on the free calnag* of stiver at
the ratio of 16 to 1. without waiting the Concur.
rence of any other nation. The Republican par
ty insisted that the question of bimetallism
was international and that until it should be
settled under agreement with the leading com
mercial nations of the world sow should con- *
tlnue to be the staiviani of value - In thesa
United State*. Â¦â¢ Upon that issue we triumphed.
In accordance with the pledjre of the party an
honest effort was matte to reach some interna
tional solution of the question. The effort
failed of accomplishment. The mtnta of the <
countries of Europe were open for the coinage
of gold alone. The vast discoveries of Alas

The passage of this bill, which received th*
vote of every Western Republican In Congress
marked the termination, forever /lnul. of anv
sort of difference between Republicans cf the
East and of the West, growing out of currency
problems. Even if the stern logic of event

The tariff measure under which we are" now
conducting business was preceded by an un
usual volume of Importations based upon com
mon knowledge that certain duties were to b~
raised; the bill mot the popular demand that
duties on many of the necessaries of life should
be lowered and not raised; advances in In

In the revenue provisions were slight Â¦ Yet
notwithstanding all these facts, tending to re
duce income, the revenues from the Dinelpv
bill marched steadily upward, until soon our
normal income exceeded our normal expendi
ture, and we passed from a condition of threat
ened insolvency to one of national solvency
This tells but a small fraction of the story.
Under the wise provisions ot our
.tariff laws and the encouragement
afforded to capital, by. a . renewal of
public confidence trade commenced to
revive.
Return of Prosperity.
Tour years of commercial misfortune enabled
our industries to meet, in a measure, these
changed and depressed conditions but when
President McKinley was inaugurated the coun
try was In a state more deplorable than had
existed for a generation.
So many events of great portent have been
crammed Into the past months, that we are
act to Judce and measure the work of tnlÂ»
administration chiefly by the occurrences slm-e
the outbreak of the Spanish war. It Is worth
while for- us to recall earlier days. .
When Mr. McKinley became resident he
took the Veins of government after four years
of DemocraUc administration. For the first
time in more than a generation Democracy
had fuH sway, with both Houses of Congress
in party accord with the Executive. No Â«um
marÂ£ of the urjlerciful disasters of those four
yeans can convey an idea of a tithe of the ruin
"in theÂ° fouf" years preceding Mr. Cleveland's
admlnl'tration we had paid $:60.CCO.COO of the
naUonal debt; he added I23O.0CO.CC0 to Its bur
dens He found a tariff acj. bearing the name
of his successor and, our President nttea to
meet the requirements of . our necessary ex
penditureF. to furnish the needed protection
to our farmers and manufacturers, and to in
sure the steady and remunerative employment
of those who labor. Instead of penulttins
manufacture Â¦ and commerce ' that repose
and stability of law which are essen
tial for worklnjr our economic conditions, he
at once recommended violent and radical
changes In revenue and tariff provisions, rec
ommendations which his party In Congress pro
ceeded partially and . disastrously to execute.
The appalling result of his policy i* still fresh
in the memory of millions who suffered from
it ' In four years the country wltnesaad some
6OC0O commercial failures, with liabilities ag
gregating more than $900,000,CÂ«). One hunUÂ»vd
and seventy-seven railroads, with a mileage
of 45.000 miles, or twice the circle of tha
glebe, and with securities amounting to nearly
$3 oeo.OCC.COO. were- unable to meet their in
terest charxes and passed into the lum'.s of.
receivers. More than 170 National Panka
closed their doors, with liabilities reaching $70,
000,000; wool and all farm products which tar
iffs could affect, lost tens of millions In value;
farm mortgages were foreclosed by thousands
throughout the great West; our agricultural
exports shrunk in value; the balance of trade
which had been in our favor turu-'d ruinously
against us: the National Treasury was de
pleted Â¦ of Us sold reserve; our â¢government
bonds were scld to syndicates at fur below
their market valuo before or since, and our
steadily declining revenues were insufficient to
meet the necessary expenses of conducting the
Government. If capital alone had suffered, the
loss would have been great, but not Irremedi
able, ttafortunately those whÂ£ rely upon their
daily â¢ labor for their sustenance, and their
families dependent upon them, constituting the
great mass of the American people, were made"
to feel heaviest this burden of disaster. Near
ly one-third of the laboring population of the
United States were thrown out of employment,
and men by thousands, able and willing to
labor, walked the highways of the laad clam
oring for work or food.

Many Colored Delegates.
The colored delegates are a more consid
erable company than have appeared in
two or three of the later national conven
tions of the Republican party, and they
have greater confidence in 'themselves, and
certainly they have more principles to as
sert and policies to maintain than in the
earlier days of their enfranchisement.
There are among them those who came
up out of Egypt through the red sea of

Lincoln, but there are representatives al

Is said now of the facile colored men,
once conspicuous in gossip, as looking for
arguments in currency. If a few tickets
are sold at reduced rates to representa
tives of the people who have no constitu
ents at hand, are not they told that the
quiet transaction smells of the bottomless
pit? Colored men who hold national of
fice are pointed out here and there in the
crowds, and their official position gives
them confidence. The -sprinkling, of col
ored delegates is a very perceptible fea
ture of the Southern delegations. It was
shown during the fierce and tedious com

'Â¦y'M Scenes in the Convention.
The ample auditorium of the convention
was slowly filled, thousands taking the
precaution to be ahead of time, and only
as they were easily placed for hours be
fore the hall was thoroughly occupied,
was the immensity of the spacious edifice
so admirably arranged understood. About
twenty thousand persons were seated.
The proportions of the place occupied are
so symmetrical that the amount of room
Is not at once comprehended. Some thou
sands of spectators were placed when the
first delegation, which was that of Penn
sylvania, arrived in a body, and the lead*
er, Mr. Quay, was received with 'warm
applause. He was the first distinguished
delegate to get a complimentary greeting.
The outburst of approval was when Gov
ernor Roosevelt and Senator Depew. with
Senators Odell and Platt. led the delega
tion of the Empire State to their seats.
The enormous hall, glowing with color,
filled with people, under a light that re
vealed every face at its best, surrounded
.with portraits of the worthiest of the re
public and the emblazoned shields of the
sovereign States, presented a magnificent
spectacle as Senator Hanna rose and in
vited the invocation of the divine blessing
upon the convention.
The Senator was greeted with great ap
plause 1 " when he directed Representative
Douglass Dick to read the official call to
the convention, a ceremony which was
effectively performed. ' Senator Hanna
was heard far and near as he presented
the temporary chairman. Senator Wolcott
of Colorado. The remarks of the Senator
were, full of pungent sentences, heard
throughout the hall and emphasized with
vehement applause. There was a wonder
fur light in the house as Senator Wolcott
opened his splendid speech. There was
ju%t enough sunshine and air to brighten
the expectant faces. The delegates and
alternates' facing the. platform were
framed with multitudes of faces that
shono as with Inner light in the galleries,
and beyond the platform occupied by the
officers were the guests, an imposing as
semblage. The front row near the chairs
was occupied by venerable men who came
down to us from a former generation, as
Daniel Webster said to. the survivors of
the battle of 'Bunker Hill half a century
after the battleâ Heaven had bounteously
lengthened out their lives to witness the
auspicious day. The ; venerable men, the
guests ef honor of the convention, were
of those who In the early days were fore
most workers in laying the foundations of
the Republican partyâ beginning with the
Liberty party half a century ago.

Another delegation that was heard very
briefly was composed of colored men and

Thcv asked for the insertion of planks
denouncing mob violence in the South and
against the suppression of the ballots of
citizens in the Southern States. The whole

delegation of ladles from the suffrage as

State Legislatures an amendment to the
constitution granting the elective fran
chise to women. The delegation was
headed by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
1 resident of the Equal Suffrage Associa
tion, and Mrs. Annie Shaw, vice president
of that association, and both made brief
speech* s in support of the proposition.
A protest againet the suffrage plank
was also submitted. This was handed in

only when it clearly appears that such an

PHILADELPHIA. June 13.â The com

the convention, and then adjourned
to meet at the Walton Hotel at 5
At that hour, however, the resolution
declared absolutely for the maintenance
of the gold standard, commended the
passage of the financial legislation of the
last session of Congress and then added
some features from the plank suggested
bv Messrs. Hanna and Payne, favoring
such legislation as will secure lower rates
of Interest in times of financial stringency
by permitting the temporary issuance of
The principal declaration of the finan
cial plank had been completed, but there
was still doubt as to whether any refer
ence would be made to silver, with the
indications favorable to a slight recogni
tion of international bimetallism, this,
however, to be accompanied by the posi
tive declaration that without internation
al agreement bimetallism Js not to re
ceive any recognition whatever.
The Question was settled at the early
evening meeting. Pending its discussion
the sub-committee adjourned to await the
action of the* revisers to meet again at
midnight. The recess until midnight was
taken for the purpose of permitting Lem
uel E. Quigg, the New York member of
the committee, to go through the draft
of the platform and to make the changes
necessitated by the action of the sub
committee. When the recess was taken
at 9 o'clock a positive policy had been de
cided upon on most of the questions con
sidered proper for action upon.
The Republican party by tradition and princi
ple is in favor of bimetallism and upon all
proper and opportune occasions we advocate the
co-operation of the United States with the other
leading commercial nations of the world to se
cure the free coinage of both gold and silver at
fixed ratio.
There/ was considerable discussion of
the financial plank, which, as it stands.
Is an absolute declaration for the gold
standa'rd. Several modifications of this
resolution were considered, among them
one suggested by the Colorado delegation,
which met favor among the Western
members. It was as follows:
The draft of the platform as proposed
by Senators Foraker and Fairbanks and
others was then read by Mr. Foraker. It

in these dispatches on Monday morning,

ed. Objection was made that it was too

mittee to revise and shorten it if pos
sible.
Financial Flank Discussed.
They made an earnest plea for the reso
lution, but it met with opposition on the
ground that it was liable to be inter
preted as calculated to disturb the finan
cial legislation already secured.
The employment of the people is the content
ment of the people. The greatest benefaction
to man is the opportunity to labor. Our best
hopes for continued prosperity lies In winning
the w-i rld's market for the products of the
American farm and factory. Lw interest
rates are potent factors In souring this result..
The wipe financial leRislatlon already enacted
by the Republican party contributes to this
end. Having secured stability in our currency,
we new favor additional monetary legislation to
equalize and lower the rates of interest by
providing flexible and sufficient medium of ex
change for the benefit of the borrower, as Tve!l
as the lender of money, in order that American
commerce may be enlarged and that labor may
be assured of steady and remunerative employ
ment.

called with the desire of ascertaining how
many contests would come before the
committee, and It was found twenty-four
were to be heard. The most Important
contests are in tne States of Texas. Louis
iana, Delaware and Tennessee. Nearly
all the other contests are confined to dis
trict delegates.
After calling the roll of States It was
decided to go into executive session.
After an extended argument on the part
of several . contestants it was arranged
that for contests Involving the seats of
delegates at large fifteen minutes should
be allowed each side for argument and
for district delegates five minutes should
be allowed each side: It was left discre

time.
The Addicks delegation from Delaware

Both sides had a long array of legal talent

of the President were fully and satisfactorily
complied with; the people of the island are
content, the vast mass of the American people
approve, and we have avoided precedents that
might vex us when we come to. deal with the
problems that finally await us In the estab
lishment of our permanent relations toward
the people of the Philippine Islands.
Power in New Possessions.
There has been much discussion during the
past few months In respect to the extent of 'he
power of this country to deal with Tcrto Kico
and other possessions, and It has been fre
quently contended by the Democracy- that as
soon as we became the owners of any of these
Islands the constitution of the United States
at once extended over them, or In the oratorical
but misleading phrase. "The constitution fol
lows the flag." The argument Is specious, but
it will not bear Investigation. The same ques
tion was raised in 1S03. at the time of the
Louisiana, purchase, and tho doctrine was then
established by Congress that we could acquire
foreign soil by purchase, that Congress had
the right to establish there such govjrnm.*nt
as It saw fit. and that the constitution did
not of its own force extend over such terri
tory. The doctrine was never questioned until
In Calhoun's time it was sought to be denied
in the effort to extend human slavery into
The Supreme Court of the United States has
more than once determined the question and
the contention concerning it now by our oppo
nents Is not because anybody believes that the
laws we have enacted for the government of the
Island are unjust, but in order to embarrass the
administration In dealing effectively with our
new possessions. The flag went to Mexico In
lS4S-tbe constitution did not. The flag went to
Cuba and was carried into Santiago and is
there yet. But our constitution not only Is
there but we are busy encouraging Cuba to
prepare a constitution of her own. When any
portion of our territory becomes a sovereign
State then is our constitution Its cornerstone.
In the territory of the United States not in
cluded within State boundaries Congress alone
determines the extent to which the provisions
of the constitution extend.
Conditions in Cuba.
The circumstances associated with our pos
session of Cuba are new and unparalleled In
the history of conquests. The cruelties practiced
upon its people Induced the war. Before we
commenced hostile proceedings, however, and
that the world might know that our bands were
clean and that we were not animated by lust
for territory we solemnly disclaimed any die
position or Intention to exercise sovereignty,
Jurisdiction or control over the island except
for Its pacification and asserted our determina
tion, when that was accomplished, to leave the
government and control of. the island to Its
people.
To this declaration' we still rigorously ad
here. When we took possession at the close of
the war we found the conditions existing in
Cuba to be deplorable. Under, the conservative
and wise manaeement of Generals Brooke and
Wood vast Improvements have been effected
and we have given the people the first good
government they have ever known. We found
its cities beds of pestilence.' We have stamped
out yellow fever an,d made Havana as healthy
a city as exists at that latitude. We took Its
starving reconcentrados who had survived the
war, and Its other poverty-stricken people, and
fed and clothed them. We organized a public
school system, and have everywhere established
law and order. This had first to be done.
Then followed, a compliance of the terms of the
treaty which gave the Spanish Inhabitants
until April li-to determine whether or not
they would . register aa citizens or preserve
their allegiance to Spain. Meanwhile a care
ful census of the Island was made. Then came
the fixing of the qualifications for the right
of suffrage, which were fairly bestowed. The
Island was divided Into municipalities and the
registration "provided for. And on yesterday,
the ISth of June, municipal elections were helU
iÂ»ll through the Island, as the first and pre
liminary. step toward the .establishment of a
national government and the adoption of a con
stitution, i V- "â¢â¢'"' '
Have Made Americans Blush.
And in this connection it is fitting to say
that the peculations and frauds committed In
Cuba by subordinate officials have made every
American blush with shame, and until the last
of the suilty men is arrested and convicted
and sentenced that shame will know no abate
ment. It Is no more to be charged to . the
party than would a theft by a trusted em
ploye be charged, against the character of the
merchant who employed him. The . party that
shields and protects dishonest officials forfeits
public confidence, not the party that exposes
and punishes i them. The Republican party
has been rarely the victim of misplaced con
fidence in its officials. < In -this : Instance, the
appointments were made with the greatest care,
many of them from the . classified service.
Whenever fraud * has been : discov

So haa It been with these, thieving Pcwtofflc*
officials, so has It been always. In the vast
aggregate of business* transacted by the Gov
ernment the dishonest man is rare, and his de
tect'on certain. The great humiliation is that
the thefts were from the people of : an island

and whose confidence we ask. That 'this Gov

It will be interesting to know that Rev. Dr. Levy delivered the invoca
tion at the first Republican convention in Philadelphia forty-four years ago.
He was born at St. Marys. Southern Georgia, nearly eighty years aeo, and
Â¦was ordained In the Baptist ministry in 1844. After being ordained Mr. Levy
wont to Newark. H. J.. where he took charge of the South Baptist Church.
After staying in Newark for several years he resigned his pastorship of
the South Baptist Church and went to Philadelphia. Mr. Levy was pastor
of the Epiphany Baptist Church at Thirty-sixth and Chestnut streets for
fifteen years. He was pastor of the Tabernacle at Thirty-seventh and
Chestnut streets for the same period. After forty years of constant ser
vice he resigned from the pulpit in 18S4. Mr. Levy's first vote was cast for
Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1S44. Mr. Levy was surprised to hear that he
had been appointed chaplain for the convention. He Is 80 years of age

people, and a conflict seemed inevitable he
faced popular clamor and heated counsels, and
still believed that the wrongs of Cuba could be
remedied and redressed without an appeal to
the arbitrament of war.
The folly of Spain and the indignation of the
American people forbade a peaceful solution.
Then the President, seconded by a Republican
Congress, before a gun was fired, declared to
the world the lofty and unselfish motives that
alone actuated the nation. No man now. or
in the centuries to come, when history, which
alone 'â¢triumphs over time," recounts the mar
velous Etory of the war which changed the
map of the world, shall ever truthfully say
.that this republic was animated by any but
the noblest purposes. Recorded time tells of
no such war, for it was fought, with bloody
sacrifice, by a great and free republic, for the
freedom of another race, while its own liber
ties were unassailed.
This Is not the time or the occasion to dwell
upon the incidents of the war. crowded with
successive victories and illumined with count
less examples of individual bravery and gal
lant conduct. Its living heroes are honored by
a generous country; Its dead have ennobled the
race and will live forever In the hearts of a
grateful people. ' Throughout all Its anxious
days the President, commander In chief of our
armies and our navies, planned and directed
with unerring hand. His diplomacy saved us
from threatened international complications.
From the commencement of hostilities until
their close the conduct of Ihe war was unas
sailable, and the paltry criticisms of two years
ago are already burled in the limbo of ob
livion.
In August. 189f. a preliminary protocol was
executed at Washington, followed by the ses
sions of the Peace Commissioners of the United
States and Spain, in Paris, commencing in Oc
tober of that year. Public , Interest In this
country concerning these negotiations was ln
tenrÂ«. Until our soldiers and sailors had landed
at Manila ire had known little of the condi
tions of the people of. the Philippines. We soon
ascertained that the cruelties and oppressions
existing in Cuba were mild compared with the
treatment to which 8,000,000 of people In those
Islands were subjected. We realized that If
we relinquished the archipelago to Spain we
consigned its inhabitants again to a condition
worse than slavery, worse than barbarism. We
had put our hands to the plow, and every In
stinct of honor and humanity forbade us to
turn back. A universal demand arose from
all over the country that we should retain our
hold upon these islands, afford their people the
protection of our laws,' lift them out of their
unfortunate condition and fit them, if possible,
for ielf-go\-ernment. Any agreement by our
commissioners to give back the Philippines to
Spain, reserving for ourselves an island or a
coaling station, would have aroused a universal
national indignation, and would never have
been ratified by the representatives of the peo
ple. . .
Philippines Must Be Liberated.
No man saw this so clearly as did the Presi
dent. In his advices to the Commissioners he
tcld them It was imperative that we should be
governed only by motives that should exalt
the nation; that territorial expansion was our
least cencern. but thet, whatever else was
done, the people of the Philippines must be
liberated from Spanish domination, and he
reached this view solely through considerations
of duty and humanity; The American Com
missioners, men of differing: political faiths,
reached Â¦ a unanimous conclusion.' The treaty
of Parts was ratified by the vote. of two-thlrdt
of the Senate, 1 and the' territory we acquired
under it became lawful and legal . possessions
of the , United States. The " responsibility f or
the war rested upon us all; the responsibility

party, and t*"Â«t party avows - the wisdom of

Ihjrlwr the -weeks and months preceding the j
outbreak of hostilities with Spain the President i
of the United States, who knew by personal
experience on many a battlefield, something of
the horror* of war. and who realised the ex
peruse and suffering which war entailed, stood i
firmly upon the ground that a peaceful solu- \
tton could be found. .And -when that awful

and encouragement of the Tagal Insurrection
come from the Democratic headquarters 'In the

were not for the hope held out to Agulnaldo by
American sympathizers' the Insurrection in the
Philippines would long ago have ended.,.
Many Obstacles Encountered.
There are parallels In our own history. "We
purchased Florida from Spain in 1S21, when it
had four thousand white settlers, for five mil
lion of dollars and other valuable considera
tions. . The Semlnoles, natives of the soil,
brave, resolute, having greater Intelligence
and character that the Tagals, disputed
our possession. We sent Andrew Jack
son down ' to fight them and it took
us twenty-one years to subdue them
and Bend what was left of them west of the
Mississippi. If the "Anti-everythings" had
lived then they would, I suppose, have urged
us to turn over Florida to Oseeola, the Aguin
aldo of tho Semlnoles'. Would you, after the
war. with Mexico and the Gadsden purchase,
have given the great area south and west of
the Arkansas to the red Apache? Not so did
our fathers : construe their duty, and as they
built, so shall we. their eons.
What would the Democracy have
us do? Give them up to rapine and
bloodshed and leave the islands as
flotsam and jetsam on the face of the
waters? 'r-'^^V-iuV
We are actually owners of the Philippines by
an undisputed and indubitable title.' We are
there as the necessary and logical outcome
of our victory over Spain. There are upward
of a thousand Islands sprinkled upon that
southern sea. peopled by more than eighty
tribes of differing race and language, and hav
ing absolutely nothing in common with each
other. Most of these tribes welcome our coming
and are grateful for our protection. The Tagal
tribe, hostile not only to us but to most of the
native tribes, are in insurrection against our
authority. They have neither a government
nor the capacity to conduct one, and are wag
ing a uredatory guerilla warfare whleh would
be turned against the other native tribes if we
let them alone.
We haven't been there long, but long enough
to reach two conclusions: One Is that the first
thing we Intend doing Is to suppress the Tagal
Insurrection and to .establish law and order
throughout the archipelago. That is the first
thing we shall do. And the last, the very last
thing- we intend doing, Is to consider, even for
a moment, the question of giving up or of
abandoning these islands.
We are told that the Islands are rich in all
the products of the tropics. In mineral wealth,
and In the possibilities of their future develop
ment. So much the better. But if they were
as barren as the Libyan desert we would have
taken them Just the same.
The future of nations,' however, like the fu
ture of man, is hid from mortal vision, and,
no more than man may a nation choose its own
duties. When this war ended and we faced
our victory in all Us completeness we found
eight millions of people, living upon uncounted
islands delivered into our hands. Abandonment
of them would be confession that while
the oppression by Spain of a million and a half
of Cubans demanded our armed Interference,
greater barbarity and cruelty to millions of
Filipinos, less able to protect themselves, was
a subject of no concern to us. No civilized na
tion In the world, no Christian nation, could
have turned these people back to "Spain. Our
commissioners, -when they Insisted upon our
retention of the Philippines, voiced the senti
ment g and wishes of the American people: and
this nation has assumed with open eyes and
with full realization of the difficulties which
may be encountered, the grave responsibilities
imposed upon us by the treaty of Paris.

There was a momentary lull, and then
Mr. Wolcott, gazing out at the assem
blage, said: '
"Governor Taylor of Kentucky Is rec
ognized." â .
Every eye was turned toward the cen
ter of the hall, where a gaunt, black
garbed figure, with the swarthy face of
an Indian, stood awaiting a pause in the
hurrah which his name evoked.
"Come to the platform, Governor; they
want to see you," called out Air. Wolcott.
The much-talked-of man from Kentucky
moved up the aisle to â¢ the platform, re
ceiving- a cheer as Senator Wolcott ad
vanced to greet him. There ,was a Â¦Â¦ mo
mentary silence as the convention waited,
apparently expecting a speech ; echoing
some of the dramatic incidents , in Ken
tucky. But. .instead of. that, in a piping
voice, Governor Taylor seconded the nom
inations of the i various officials who had
been announced, and; tni3 done, left the
stage. The nominations were made unan
imous.
" "Mr. Payne of ; New -York," announced
the chairman, and again all eyes turned
to the center of the hall, where this time
the chairman ; of ' the Ways and Means
Committee was seen.. He moved that the
rules , of." the last j convention : prevail until
other rules were adopted, and this was
agreed . to ; without dissent.
The call of the roll of States for the

committees -'then began. "It proved a
tedious process; and. the convention- was

Governor Taylor Recognized.
Senator Wolcott has a clear, resonant
voice which penetrated to the farthest
recess of the hall. He speaks, however,
with great rapidity, and this, perhaps,
somewhat spoiled the effect of his speech.
But the thousands before him were in
thorough sympathy and he had no dif
ficulty in striking a jesponsive chord.
When, with outstretched arms, he pre
dicted the triumphant election of the Re
publican ticket in November the audience
surrendered, and when he first mentioned
President McKinley's name he could not
proceed for a minute owing to the demon
stration. As he rehearsed the history of
the four years of Republican administra
tion, the prosperity which had blessed it,
the victories it had won. the glorious out
come of the Spanish-American war, the
campaign of misrepresentation in connec
tion with the Philippines which its ene
mies had inaugurated and which It had
met, the convention repeatedly broke Into
applause.- , ..
It was a keynote speech, covering the
legislation which had been placed on the
statute books, and its deepest note was
the prosperity of this country and the
legislation which made its continuation
possible if the present administration was
continued in power. That was the theme
to which the demonstration of the con
vention clung. When he said that the old
issue of the Democrats was dead and that
thev were driven to find new issues in a
war which they had boen most anxious
to precipitate, the convention rose, but
the outburst was even greater when he
declared that the division among the
Republicans of the East and the West on
the financial Issue was a thing of the
past and that those who had . left the
party four years ago In the West were re
turning on the issue of expansion. The
first mention of expansion was also the
signal for a demonstration. Â¦
Senator Wolcott paced up and down
along the front of the platform as he
proceeded, and several times consulted his
notes. He is not at his best in a pre
pared speech, and his admirers were pos
sibly a little disappointed. He concluded
his speech at 2:12 o'clock.
The Indiana delegation led the applause
when Senator Wolcott announced that the
thieving postofllce officials in Cuba would
be hunted down. Probably the greatest
demonstration occurred when he said that
we would establish law and order In the
Philippines, and. that the last thing to be
considered was to give up the islands.
Tho delegates got on their feet and
cheered when he declared that our sol
diers were burled in tha sands of Luzon
and we would never give up the soil that
held our dead. _Â¦--Â¦Â¦
He spoke an hour and ten minutes and
as his brilliant peroration closed there was
another enthusiastic demonstration of ap
proval, delegates standing on chairs and
waving hats, umbrellas and handker
! chiefs, while at the same time the band
added the enlivening strains of a patriotic
air. Mr. Wolcott received many hearty
handshakes from those about him, and
then turned to the convention, announcing
the long list of secretaries and officials
: previously agreed upon.
Wolcott's a Keynote Speech.
Whatever else In the past has suffered change
or decay, the Republican p&rty. which for forty
years has been identified with everything en
nobling and uplifting in our history was never
as vital, as virile and as vigorous as to-day.
And the heritage we shall transmit to the
new century, to the coming generation and to
their children, and to their children^ children,
shall be a record clean and untarnished, an
unquenchable faith In free institutions, an un
alterable belief in the patriotism of the people
and an undying love or liberty and of country.

All's right with the world."

advocate of their retention. Our dead are bu

no foreign flag shall ever salute ihe dawn.
Whatever may be in store for us in the new
and unbeaten track upon which we are enter
ing, we shall not be found "with the unlit
lamp and the unglrt loin." Our way is new.
but it is not dark. In the readjustment of
world-conditions, where we must take our place
with the other great nations of the earth, we
shall move with caution, but not with fear.
We seek only to lift up men to better things,
.to bless and not to destroy. The fathers of
the republic accepted with courage such re
sponsibilities as devolved upon them. The same
heavens bend over us and the same power
that shielded them will guard and protect us,
for what we seek is to build stilt more firmly,
always upon foundations of probity and of
virtue, the glorious edifice of the republic.
We stand at the dawn of the new century.
Before it shall have reached its meridian the
youngest here will have passed beyond this life
or beyond the sphere of usefulness. New re
cruits will step into the ranks as we fall out.
This very year thousands of young men will
for the first time exercise the right of citizen
ship and cast their ballots at the national
election. The safety of this republic must ever
rest in "the courage of young hearts and the
vigor of a noble manhood." Youth is buoyant
and hopeful. No snarling criticism, or gospel
of a little America, or prophecy of despair
will find response from hearts that beat full
and strong with courage and with faith, and

New Jersey with 20 votes and California
with IS declared for Long. Other States
evinced a desire to support any candidate
agreeable to the administration, while
there are a numbter of States In the "West
that are determined to vote for Roose
velt. In Maryland there was a curious
action. The delegation was favorable to
Roosevelt, but decided to take him at his
word and not support Â¦ him. Then they
heard that the administration was for
Long and a number of them sent word to
Hanna that Long's, nomination would
make It difficult to carry that State on
account of the feeling for Rear Admiral
Schley, who is a native of Maryland. The
delegates preferred to vote for Dolliver
fer these reasons.
Platt then tried to get an admission
from Hanna to support Odell. and this
was refused on the ground of being unjust
to the other candidates In the field. Platt
asked for time and the matter went back
to the New York delegation.
Hanna talked to Platt as he had talked
to Odell and Quay the day before. He
told him that because Platt does not want
Roosfivelt in New York was no reason
why he should attempt to force him upon
the party in national politics.
The conferences between Senator Hanna
and Senator Platt were an interesting
feature of the Vice Presidential contest.
Platt and Hanna Confer.
This Is one of the chances that Senator
Hanna is willing to take in the fight he is
making.
"I have'from the beginning of the con
sideration of this subject occupied one po
sition and, that was that if at any time it
should be. apparent that the convention
desired or demanded the nomination of
Governor Roosevelt, he should feel him
self obliged to respond favorably; I would
not be in line against him. Otherwise I
would ask for the support of the delegates
of the State of New York, a considerable
number of whonvat one time and another
have told me that they would give me
their support. I thank them. I" find from
all I have heard since I have been here
that the delegation wants Governor Roose
velt nominated for Vice President. I be
lieve that a very large majority, not only
a very large majority, but practically all
of the members of this delegation desire
it. Having no preference for any other
man, it does seem to me impossible that
Mr. Woodruff said
Chairman Depew said the meeting was
called for the purpose of deciding whether
the New York State delegation should net
upon a nomination for Vice President.
Governor Roosevelt had made a state
ment of his' position, but that statement
had not stopped the sentiment \n his fa
vor. He moved thai Lieutenant Governor

floor and this was ordered.

authority to use 'the President's name in
a way to make the delegates feel obliged
to vote for any particular candidate.
It was rumored that to-day a message
had been received from the President,
saying that the convention must reir.ain
untrarrmeled and the administration must
not be brought into the matter in any
way. To whom it was sent, If at. ill.
could not be learned, although it was said
Senator Hanna. bad received such a mes
sage. The Senator, when asked if he had
received a telegram to that effect, replied
that he had not received a telegram from
the President since he had been in Phila
delphia. . i Â¦
The Senator did not believe that there
would, be a loss of more than a few votes,
although Dolliver men in the West de
clare-<hat they will not vote for Lon?,
and there seems to be a large number of
Eastern men who are now for Long who
say they prefer Roosevelt to Dolllver.
"If we can't do it, then we have not got
control of the convention," said Senator
Hanna. "If the friends of the President
cannot agree upon a candidate, and by
their differences cause the nomination of
a man that is not wanted and does not
want the place they will have to take the
responsibility for it."
In making the fight against Roosevelt
Senator Hanna finds the opponents of
Roosevelt divided, some for Long and
some for Dolliver. The question of trans
ferring the vote from one to the other
without nominating the man they wish is
the difficult problem.
The next serious proposition that con
fronts Mr. Hanna Is what he shall do as
between Long and Dolliver. There is a
popular sentiment for Dolliver In the
West that is hard to overcome. Long Is
regarded as a passive kind of a candidate,
and while no objection is urged against
him he does not attract the delegates.
But he is Mr. Hanna's personal choice and
is preferred by the President. Dolliver's
friends have pointed out to Senator
Hanna that the Iowa candidate has now
got Into the fight so far that he wants to
win. to which Hanna replied that defeat
would not injure Dolliver. He had al
ready acquired a great deal of promi
nence, says Senator Hanna, and he- will
not be injured if he should be defeated by
a candidate like Secretary Long.
Long: and Dolliver.
One thing definitely 'developed. There
is to be a fight. The nomination is not to
be made without a contest. . Senator
Hanna is dcing all he can to defeat Roose
velt and has determined to continue on
that line to the end. He is lining up the
friends of ths administration against
Roosevelt. In this he is acting in har
mor.y with the wishes of Roosevelt, who
has urged all delegates visiting him not
to vote for him for Vice President.
"Under these circumstances it does seem
to me that Governor Roosevelt ought to
be the selection of New York State. nQt
necessarily that the delegation should
present his name, but that he should take
the nomination. Unless this delegation
decides upon some one the nomination will
"If I thought I could be, nominated by
this convention I certainly would encour
age the sentiment which my friend from
Brooklyn has pressed. But thWe is an
uncertainty as to whether I can be nom
inated even If presented by the State.
There is not a man In the room who does
not know that Governor Roosevelt can be
nominated and that he would be satisfac
tory to every man In the convention.
There may be those who for reasons best
known to themselves but not to me seek
to nominate some one else. No one else
could be nominated who would be near as
strong.
Mr. Waldo of Kings urged the delega
tion to take Governor Roosevelt at his
word. He urged that the delegates agree
upon a candidate, but they certainly could
not decide upon Governor Roosevelt, he
said, when the Governor had earnestly
requested them not to support him. There
was then but one candidate before the
delegation, Mr. Waldo said, who had any
considerable support, and that was Lieu
tenant Governor Woodruff, an 3 the whole
delegation had supported him, as Gover
nor Roosevelt was not a candidate. He
closed by moving that Lieutenant Gover
nor Woodruff be made the choice of the
delegation for .Vice President. j
James R. Howe seconded the nomina
tion. ,
Lieutenant Governor Woodruff then
said:
Teddy Taken at His Word.
"I earnestly ask that every friend of
mine in the convention will respect my
wishes and my judgment In the matter,
and I ask it now of you. my fellow dele
gates, of you, my friends, who cannot be
any more Jealous than I am of the grand
name of the party and the party's success
in New York State." (Applause.)
The Governor then said with emphasis
"Now, gentlemen, I want to repeat to
you the last sentence, word for word, of
the statement I made yesterday."
"Gentlemen and Delegates: After lis
tening to the equally generous and dig
nified statement of the Lieutenant Gov
ernor It is due to him that I should say
one word as to my position. It Is simply
to ask you to take the words I have ut
tered at their face value. If you don't
think I mean them you don't believe in
me for Vice President or "anything else.
But If you think I mean them, then I
ask you to stand with me. After a long
consultation with my men, not a few of
whom are present here to-night. I defin
itely took the position that I did not wish
to be nominated for Vice President; that
if the Republican party. chose to renorn
inate me for Governor I should be pleased
to accept. I took that position not in the
least from regard to my own predilec
tions, but In the belief that there I could
do the best serviceâ the best workâbe
cause I have never felt that I had a right
to say that if nominated I should refuse.
Certain men have seemed to doubt me as
to what "I mean to say.
Governor Roosevelt spoke next. He
said:
Roosevelt Speaks Plainly.
"It seems to me that < the time has now
arrived when it should be determined
whether or not New York is to have a
candidateâ Governor Roosevelt or some
body else, because ,1 believe it necessary
to the success of the Republican party as
far as the Republican party is concerned.
We ought to have the Vice Presidential
nomination. Our State will be the bat
tle ground in the campaign. If Governor
Roosevelt or some other man from New
York State is not nominated by the con
vention our success will certainly be im
periled. The 'conditions have been such
during the past few days that It does
seem 'to, me that this delegation should
settle the matter among themselves. The
Governor himself, being a delegate, can
argue his own case."
he could resist such a demand. For that
reason I have not asked any member to
support my candidacy.
PHILADELPHIA. June 19.-L5euten
| ant Govc-rr.or T1moth>*'L. Woodruff!
c Trill be presented to the National
Itepublfean Convention as the can
didate of New York for Vice Presi
<>nt. It was decided to do this 'after a
four hours* stormy session of the New
York delegation, during which every kind
nf appeal was made to get Governor
Hooaetrelt to say that he would accept the
jiomlnatlon. The Vice Presidential situ
ation is srill mixed, because It is asserted
that New York makes this move so as to
go into the convention with a candidate
nnd yet hoping that Roosevelt will ba
nominated. Senator Hanna has stated
that he controls the delegates to such an
Â« xtcnt that he can nominate any candi
date he pleases, and it is not known that
ho has withdrawn his objections to Wood
ruff. The latter was as much surprised
as anybody over the result.
In general the idea seems to be preva
lent that Secretary Long is the most fa
ired candidate, with a probability that
Koosevelt may still be nominated. Gov
ernor Roosevelt believes that, his wishes
having been respected by his own delega
tion, he is finally out of the race.
Eanna's Pointed Statement.
""What is the situation to-night. Sena
tor?"
"Roosevelt is out of it and will not be
nominated."
The question was put to Senator Hanna
and that is the way he answered it. This
was after another effort during the day
to stampede the delegates to Roosevelt.
As before the effort was made by New
York or.d Pennsylvania. Plait and Quay,
through their lieutenants, worked all day
to make Roosevelt the candidate. The
stampede which had been checked and
turned last night was begrun early in the
morninjc. Many stories were circulated.
Roosevelt was quoted as saying abso
lutely that he would accept If nominated.
He was also quoted as having had a
change of heart and wanted the nomina
tion. In fact, all kinds of rumors were In
circulation, and the situation remained
cloudy all day and did not clear very
much in the evening.
General Francis Greene said: x
it would be a serious mistake ta norninato
Governor Roosevelt for Vice Presidentâ si
serious mistake for the party at large, for
the party In New York and for governor
Roosevelt himself. In my humble judg
ment, he is the strongest man In the stare
for the otflce of Governor. It 13 \ery
doubtful if any one else can be elected
Governor. I thin- if he Is not the candi
date for Governor we will lose the State
of New York and thereby the^ nation. L
agree that the State of New Ttork ought
to have a candidate. The Governor does
not wish the Vice Presidency. To whom
then shall we turn? The Lieutenant oov
ernor la a worthy candidate."
Edward Lauterbach of New York, who
has been one of the most ardent support
ers of the Roosevelt Vice Presi.U-ntial
boom, made an earnest appeal for Koope
vc-lt to take the nomination. He flntshea
by saying, after a passionate appeal to
Roosevelt to take the nomination: I don t
think we ought to select any candidate,
but simply let the convention do so. and
Governor Roosevelt no declining will bo
nominated." i . I ., .
Chairman Depew said the question be
fore the body was Mr. Waldos motloa to
make Mr. Woodruff the candidate. In an
instant a delegate jumped to his feet and
made a motion to substitute the name or
Governor Roosevelt. There were cries of
"No." and several counter-motions to lay
on the table and adjourn were made.
Finally a brief recess was taken after tha
Kings County men madÂ© a last appeal for
Mr. "Woodruff. '
When the gavel fell again Mr. Depew
put the- Woodruff motion and the dele
gates carried it with a few dissenting
votes, and the caucus adjourned.

Turr.ing to Governor Roosevelt he said:
"I know that you are absolutely sincere
and I know that you desire the guberna
torial nomination, but there is no ques
tion that the feeling among the delegates
here makes your nomination absolutely
inevitable. As long as there Is any possi
bility of accepting the nomination it is
right that you should receive it by accla-

only one man who could strengthen the
ticket and that was Roosevelt. Hweto

4PHILADELPHIA. June 19.â After two
days of uncertainty the California delega
tion decided to support Secretary Long
for Vice President. Some of the delegates
would be glad to vote for Roosevelt, but
they arc inclined to take him at his word
end refrain from voting for him. George
A. Knight, chairman of the delegation,
paid to-night that In the circumstances it
would cast its eighteen votes for Long.
The Secretary is very popular, not only In
California, but all along the Pacific Coast,
and, with Roosevelt out of the race, he
probably. In the opinion of his California
irlends. will receive generous support
from that section.
The Minnesota delegation will meet to
morrow morning to consider the advisa
bility of placing the r.ame of ex-Senator
W. D. Washburn of that State before the
convention for Vice President. It is be
lieved to be almost certain that the dele
gation will decide to honor the ex-Senator,
and Cushman 1C Davis will be the man
to make the nominating speech. Many of
the delegates to-nipht expressed them
pelves as being In iavor of naming Mr.
Washburn and voting for him until a can
didate is decided upon.
The X'tah delegation is deadlocked over
the selection of a national committeeman
and it appears more than likely that the
disagreement will be carried to the na
tional committee for settlement. Three
of the delegates â Governor Wells, Thomas
Kerns and Edward Loose â presented the
rame of O. J. Salisbury of Salt Lake City,
but he is not satisfactory to the remainder
of the delegation. The six alternates are
opposed to him. Their objection is based
upon the fact that Mr. Salisbury bolted
the party and went over to Bryan, refus
ing to serve on the national committee
at'er he had been elected in bt. Louis.
The deiegatee opposed to him are Senator

WALTON', PHILADELPHIA, June 19.â
Judge Van Fleet and Messrs. Spreckels,
Peixotto and Spear remained in Washing
ton last night so as to.be on hand lest
any further action was necessary in the
matter of the California quarantine. Spear
and Peixotto called on the Chinese Min
ister on Monday night and talked over the
situation with him. The Minister was
pleased to see and converse with persons
! who had been on the field and was much
interested In all details. He expressed
great satisfaction at the course now taken
by the Federal authorities in Washing
ton. The four gentlemen who remained
over took an early morning train from
Washington to Philadelphia.
On reaching Philadelphia Mr. Spreckels
found waiting him numerous dispatches
thanking him for his efforts and asking
him to convey thanks and congratulations
to the delegation. Many of the delegation
received individual dispatches. The spirits
of the delegates were made much lighter
and all felt much relieved. The Eastern
papers make very little comment on these
matters so vital to California, all space
being given up to convention items.
U. S. Grant Jr., delegate-at-large, and
H. G. Bond delegate,' reached here and
the delegation went into the convention
complete. Dr. George C. Pardee has been
appointed to go on the committee to no
tify the nominee for Vice President. The
delegation held a meeting In the morning
and passed resolutions thanking those |
who had contributed fruits, wine and
other California cheer.
The reception room is filled with visitors
all the while and hospitality in true Cali
fornia style ia continually dispensed.
The delegates expressed themselves as
much pleased with the address of the
temporary chairman, Senator Wolcott;
but more than one was heard to say,
"General Barnes could have done better.
tVe would like to hear him address the
convention on expansion and present Re
publicanism."
The weather is delightful: nothing bet
ter could be wished for. The hall is spa
cious and airy, the crowd well handled
and directed, facilities for reaching the
hall good and, generally, Philadelphia has
done well. A committee of Philadelphia
citizens is at hand to look after all dele
gations and the Callrornians have ex
tremely pleasant and attentive gentlemen
In attendance upon them. The committee
had a spacious house specially and ex
clusively at the disposal of the Califor
nians to see last night's big parade ami
after the parade a fine spread was served.
This was due to the thoughtful consid
eration and courtesy of Sheriff Crowe of
Philadelphia, a friend of Mose Gunst of
the delegation. Sheriff Crowe has taken
a. special .Interest in the comfort and ac
commodation of the delegation.

then the lobby crowd would sing, or try
to, and wind up with a college yell.
Later In the night a drum and fife

had been neglected, started In and added

AUSTIN, .Tex., June 19.â The State
Democratic convention meets in this city
to-morrow and many delegates arrived to
day. 'There is no formidable contest com
ing before the convention over the selec
tion of the Kansas City delegation. Those
opposed to Congressman Bailey on gen
eral principles, are arraying their forces
with a view of making a fight against
him at I every turn, but they are not se
curing that support which would indicate
that they will have very much weight In
the convention to-morrow. Bailey's fight
will Â¦ be for a strong anti-expansion plank
in the platform and this is the only issue
to come before the convention. The dele
gates will undoubtedly be instructed for
Bryan.

MILWAUKEE. June 19.â The Interna

Union, in session here to-day, received
from President E. W.'Tatum of the Inter

resolution adopted by that organization
providing a commission to amend the tri

"The examination by expert account
ants of the Treasurer's office from the
date of' its inception last year haa been
completed. The office was found. In ex
cellent condition. It has also been con
clusively proved that the charge of ex
travagance in the matter of salaries to
Americans, paid from the island funds, la
absolutely without foundation. The fact
of the case is that the highest salaries
paid in the island are paid to Cubans.
The reports of extravagance in transpor

BOSTON. June 19.-Senator Hoar was
questioned to-day regarding a special dis
patch from "Washington, saying that rum
ors of an extra session of Congress to
empower the President to send Â» -oops to
China was current in that cit>.
"Of course," said the Senator, "I can
give only a party opinion, but I should
say that it would require an earthquake
sufficiently severe to shake every house in
the nation to induce the President to call
an exjra session, particularly at this time,
with an election pending. I have no doubt
the President will act upon his own re
sponsibility and send to China as many
troops as may be needed there."

To Chief Justice Marshall, then, the nation owes
a debt that should be gratefully remembered. The
centennial of his appointment to the Chief Justiceship
occurs on : February 4, loor. There is therefore ample
time for preparation to" make the ceremonies of com
memoration impressive and popular', and since the
bench and bar have undertaken the matter, it is to be
hoped they will carry it out upon a scale that will_be
worthy of the occasion. ;,
A JOHN MARSHALL fJNNiVERSARY|
/""* ENTENNIAL celebrations have become so
l^ popular in the United States that not infre
quently they are held in commemoration of men
or events that hardly merit it. The only justification
for some of them has been that they afforded
an opportunity for making a public holiday. There
will be; however, a general approval of the movement
now under way to get the whole bench and bar of the
United States to join in celebrating with appropriate
ceremonies the one hundredth anniversary of the ac
cession of John Marshall to the position of Chief
Justice of the United States.
It may be doubted if any warrior or statesman has
had a more potent influence upon the nation than
Marshall. The constitution, which statesmen framed
and which warriors have defended and preserved, was
but a doubtful creation until Marshall breathed into it
the breath of life. During his long term of thirty
four years on the bench he 'pronounced judgment
upon almost every disputed point of the constitution
and gave to its words the force and scope which they
now have in our courts. What would have been 'the
effect had the early decisions of the Supreme Court
been, pronounced by a Justice who interpreted tliem
in accordance with the doctrines of; the strict con
structionists it is difficult to say. It is certain, how
ever, that much of our history would have been dif
ferent, and all that part of national development and
social order which are affected by the decisions of
courts would have been quite otherwise than what
they are. /
CHINESE AND CHRISTIANITY.
y~) ISHOP CRANSTON, who recently returned
j\ from China, preached a sermon in Denver last
Sunday. It is proper for a Bishop to preach,
ind Sunday is the right day. That this Bishop
jresched, and on Sunday, therefore fills the religious
iroprieties. The action of the Bishop derives its in
crest from the fact that he appeared and preached as
i Christian Bishop and on the Christian Sabbath,
vhen his discourse was not at all Christian nor suited
o the day and place of its delivery- The preacher
>reached about China, and in his sermon may be seen
he spirit that has caused the Boxer revolution in that
:mpire, probably at the expense of breaking the peace
af the world. In his sermon the Bishop said: "It
s worth any cost in money, it is worth any cost in
bloodshed, if we can make the millions of Chinese
:rue and intelligent Christians. I would cut all the
ed tape in the world and break all the treaties ever
nade to place the armies of the United States in the
ore, next to Great Britain. The open door must be
naintained for Christianity as well as for commerce."
We desire to say that the Bishop is not a Christian.
He preaches paganism of the most revolting type.
There is positively not a line in the New Testament
nor in the whole scheme of Christianity that teaches
the shedding of blood and the breaking of promises
as a means of making "true and intelligent Chris
tians." The Bishop h a Mahometan. That creed was
propagated by the sword. It broke treaties, violated
promises and counted nothing wrong that spread
Islam.
We wish to say, also, that the United States as a
Government has nothing to do with spreading Chris
tianity or any other religious creed. This is a secular
Government purely, and not a theocracy. As for the
Bishop's brand of Christianity, to propagate it would
be a crime. It is a thorough misrepresentation of
the whole spirit taught by the founder of Christianity.
It means the opening of a bloody tragedy more hor
rible than the campaigns of Attila, "the scourge of
God," or those of Genghis Khan or Timour. To
force a religion by the sword upon nearly five hun
dred millions of people, "no matter at what cost in
blood or money," and to begin the process by faith
less violation of solemn treaties, is to destroy Chris
tianity itself. At the close of such a tragedy the re
ligion of Christ will be found exactly where the state
religion of Rome was after her subjugation of the
world. â¢
Bishop Cranston has given an impetus to crime
everywhere by this sermon which is incalculable. If
public faith is not to be kept, individual faith will not
be kept. If war is to be made solely to advance re
ligion, against people whose offense is the acceptance
of a form of the religious idea that is senior to Chris
tianity, the world sees the sham and avails itself of
the example, and thereby. the cunning of every thief
is justified and the arm of every murderer is nerved.
It is to be hoped that the American pulpit will
promptly and unanimously repudiate this Bishop and
his sermon. And it is to be hoped that all good citi
zens will vindicate the purely secular character of our
, Government by insisting that it shall not enter a
murdering partnership with" the other nations, and
break heads and treaties to propagate a religion
which was founded by the Prince of Peace.
This sermon expresses sentiments that would cause
a shudder if uttered by a Comanche or Apache Indian,
and they, gain no better quality in the mouth of an
ordained minister and a consecrated Bishop.
There is one novelty in Paris that ought to be imi
tated at every exposition hereafter and that is the
establishment of schools for the purpose of teaching
the public what to study among the exhibits and how
to profit by it.
The lawyer who is accused of seeking to sell posi
tions in the local Police Department must have im
bibed his notions of civil sen-ice from the administra
tion of jome of our "reform" "commissions.
Among the things the people would like to know
as matters of passing curiosity is who stole the silver
plank out* of the Democratic State platform and what
was done with it.
The Bryanites will perhaps try to run a .Vice Presi
dential boom up against' Dewey, so as to have an off

THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
SENATOR WOLCOTT spoke with the enthu
siasm natural to the occasion when he took the
chair of the Republican National Convention
yesterday, but there was nothing of exaggeration in
his words. It is literally true, as he said: "Since the
first party convention in these United States there
was never one gathered under such hopeful and aus
picious circumstances as those which surround us
to-day. United, proud of the achievements of the
past four years, our country prosperous and happy,
\yith nothing to regret and naught to make us
ashamed, with a record spotless and clean, the Re
publican party stands facing the dawn, confident that
the ticket it shall present will command public ap
proval, and that in the declaration of its principles and
its purposes it will voice the aspirations and hopes of
the vast majority of American freemen."
Four years ago, after a. period of as widespread
a'nd as acute distress as ever fell upon the people of
this country, the Republican party met in convention
to face the clamors of agitators and demagogues try
ing to excite class antagonisms, demanding a depre
ciation of the money of the republic and threatening
the constitution itself. It had then a stormy contest
before it, and so strongly had the distresses of tlje
panic years affected the popular mind that it was by
no means sure what the result would be. ' Once
more, however, there was evinced that saving com
mon sense among the people which makes popular
government possible. The government was intrusted
to the Republican party. The results are perceived on
every hand in the thousand evidences of revived in
dustry, and are felt in every home through the in
fluence of an abounding prosperity. Thus it has come
about, that this year the prospects of the party are
better and brighter than ever before in its history, and.
with the exception of the great emergency in which it
came forth to save the Union and to free the slave, it
was never more useful to the republic, nor;was that
usefulness more thoroughly understood by the voters.
m It is to be noted there i% nowhere any distrust of
what the convention will do or leave undone. No
one doubts that the nominees will have the cordial
support of all Republicans, or that the platform will
be of a nature to merit, the approval of conservative
citizens, no matter to what party they belong. -The
people ,will follow the proceedings of the convention
knowing beforehand that McKinley will be, renomi
nated, that a man worthy of. the Presidency itself will
be named for Vice President, and. that the platform
will guarantee the maintenance of that policy of pro
tection and sound money upon which our prosperity
is based, and that vigor of administration of foreign
affairs which has given the republic a mightier pres
.tige in the world; than it ever had before. Senator,
Wojcott was therefore right in the double claim that
the convention meets under most auspicious circum
stances, arid that it will voice the aspirations and the
hopes of the vast majority of American freemen;

The resolution now before the Supervisors demand ing that Phelan's board get out
before its follies and falsehoods do further harm reveals the double dealing of the Mayor's
appointees. . It seems that the Mayor's board got the assent of the Supervisors to the
quarantine of Chinatown by the assurance that if this were not done the State Board of
Health would quarantine the whole city. -The Supervisors subsequently learned that this
was false. The city would not be quarantined without the consent of the Governor, and
he positively refused to permit it. It was by this sharp practice and double-dealing that
the Supervisors were induced to give their consent. It was by this deliberate deception
that the Merchants' Association and individual business men were induced to join in
calling for the Chinatown quarantine. Yet this statement was made by Phelan's board
after it had knowledge that Governor Gage would prohibit a quarantine of the city. Such
misconduct is flagrant. If the members of Phelan's board had a spark of right feeling
within them they would resign. If the Mayor had any sober conception of decency or duty
he would dismiss them from office. Refusing to do so, he should himselfbe ousted from
office if the law warrant such a proceeding.
This disgraced and virulent Board of Health cannot be useful to this city in the*
future. Its sodden persistence in a policy of ignorance, spite and falsehood has destroyed
all confidence in it, and if any pestilence should appear in the future the people would not
believe any statement it might make.
Mayor Phelan has it in his power to benefit the city by doing two things. He should
first remove this Board of Health and then himself resign and let some one become
Mayor who has the mature judgment and sober mind required for the proper administra
tion of the office.
They refuse to leave now. The ropes are down, the. police guards are withdrawn.
Yet the Chinese are going into that quarter of the city instead of running from it in a
not exist.
There is other evidence that the plaguy is not here in the fact that the Chinese have
all stood their ground. They know what this disease is far better than Phelan's doctors
know it. Where it exists they do not stay. If there had been plague in Chinatown the
Chinese population would have fled long ago. They do not' stay where it is any more
than white people stay with yellow feyer or cholera.
be computed.
The whole official contact of the Phelan government with the plague matter has
been , characterized by lack" of sense and judgment; The Phelan Chief,- of Police and the
Phelan Board of -Health have omitted no startling folly and offense that they could
commit. The midnight roping of Chinatown last March by the Chief of Police was. the
act of a vain, ignorant and incompetent officer. As a preventiveof infection, had. disease
been present, it was without efficacy. It could do nothing to - prevent spread of plague,
and could only inflictharm upon the city.and State. From that until the last quaran
tine of that quarter was suspended by the courts, the conduct of the Chief ; of Police and
Board of Health has been consistently foolish, weak, willful and injurious. Twenty or
thirty thousand Chinese were not prevented access to and contact with tlie places and
persons when the board pretended to locate plague. If the disease had been there, all
Chinatown would be suffering, with it now.
When the Governor of the State, aided by the best medical" talent here, Jiad made
a thorough investigation and reported no plague here, Mayor Phelan said he-would pay
no more attention to it than to the opinion of a quack doctor. His response to this
investigation and to the action of the Federal court was through' his Board of Health to
encourage Dr. Kinyoun to inflict awful injury upon the whole. State by putting it under
general quarantine, still without isolating a house where any supposed case of the plague
had occurred.
Let it be remembered that the Federal court granted to Phelan's Board of Health
the power to quarantine any such house, but none has*been quarantined, either by the
Mayor's board or its partner in vicious folly, Dr. Kinyoun. Refusing, therefore, to use
a power lawfully theirs, tlie members of the Mayor's board confess themselves either faith
less to their duty or guilty of falsehood as to the fact of plague being here, now or ever.
The quarantine must be based upon a fact. That fact must be the presence and
existence of the pestilence. If present, the house where it exists must be quarantined
and isolated. But the- board has not quarantined any house;- It has not isolated any
case. Therefore the foundation of fact even for an illegal quarantine of the State does
THE proceeding instituted by Supervisor McCarthy to oust Mayor Phelan's pesti
lent Board of Health should be pushed to completion. The Mayor,. by standing by
the incompetents on his board, has inflicted an injury upon California that cannot

SALISBURY'S VIEWS ON
MURDER OF CHRISTIANS
CRUISERS READY TO
PROCEED TO CHINA
LONDON, June 19.â Lord Salisbury was
tho principal speaker at the bl-centennary
meeting this afternoon of the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel, which took
place in this city.
Referring to China he said that though
tho- persona slaughtered were Christians,
it must not be imagined they were mur
dered simply because the Chinese disliked
their religion. It was because the laata
prevailed there and elsewhere that mis
sionary work waa merely an instrument
by which a secular government achieved
its objects. While this was unjust, and
though the missionaries could not re
nounce'their work, the utmost caution
ought to mark their actions, as overzeal
ousness led to martyrdom and caused the
death of sailors and soldiers sent to
avenge the outrages.
TOULON, June 19.â The greatest activ
ity prevail? here with a view of guarding
against any eventuality, but with the ex
ception of the order to prepare two cruis
ers to proceed to Chinese waters no in
structions have been received yet.
The vessels to be sent will be either
d'Assas and du Chayla or the Algerand
Bugeaud, any of which, or all can be
made ready to sail in a week's time. Â¦ â¢
There is also the question of forming
a liuht division of cruisers to be composed
of La Volsler, La Lande, Forbin, Wattig

tion. No reports were received at the
State Department to-day from any of its
officials in China. It is not known, conse
quently, whether or not our naval vessels
were with the other foreign ships in the
engagement at Taku on Saturday.
In the absence of a copy of the orders
to Admiral Kempff. it is not possible to
give a precise definition of his position,
but the facts are wider than was sup
posed. He Is not limited to the protection
to American life and property, but may
do anything in his judgment to conserve
American interests of any kind In China.
This instruction opens up unexpected pos
sibilities, involving even an alignment of
the United States with China in case It
may be found necessary In that manner
to prevent the usurpation or destruction
l>y other powers of such trade privileges
as we now enjoy in China, Improbable as
Euch alignment may be.
A significant fact In this connection is
that the official view here is still that
there is not yet a Btate of war between
China and the United States.
It Is contended that the stirring events
of Sunday morning did not of necessity
involve U3 in war and that the action of
the Chinese commander at Taku may yet
be disavowed or proved to have, -been
based on Ignorance or misunderstanding.
In thl* case it still gives opportunity for
explanation byÂ« the Chinese Government
nnd suitable reparation that shall close
this Incident without war.
The Russian charge here, Mr. Wollant,
to-day notified Secretary- Hay that his
Government was dispatching 4000 troops
from Port. Arthur to Taku. -The depart
ment accepted this statement without
CHINA STILL HAS TIME
TO MAKE REPARATION
WASHINGTON. June 19.â Adjutant
General Corbin declared positively that up
to date only one regimentâ the Ninth In
fantryâhad been ordered from Manila to
China.
In addition to the Oregon, which is to
po up to Taku from Hongkong, the Buf
falo, with 300 green landsmen aboard, has
been ordered from Southampton, England,
to the Philippines, while the gunboats
Princeton and Marietta, which are ad
mirably suited to service in the Peiho
River, above Taku, have been held at
Cavite under orders to be ready for ser
vice at any moment.
The Zafiro also has been held at the
same place In readiness to take on sup
plies for the naval contingent at Taku.
If the Princeton and Marietta join Ad
miral Kempff, as seems probable now, he
will have at his command a more numer
ous and effective fleet of gunboats adapt
ed to the service on the Peiho River as
far up as Tientsin than has any other na-
LONDON. June 20, 3 a. m.â The Rus
sian relieving force arrived outside
Peking this morning, says the
Shanghai correspondent of the
Dally Express, and Immediately
began to attack the city on two sides,
emp'.ovlng numerous artillery.
The force apparently arrived in the
nick of time, for the Chinese assert that
the attack upon the legations had be^ni
successfully renewed. On the night of
June 16 the Chinese troops under Genera.s
Tung Fah Slang and Tung Chlng attacked
the legations and set on fire five European
buildings. Nothing definite is known as
to the result. Reports, utterly discredited
by foreigners here, are that the Chinese,
infuriated by the destruction of Taku,
have since massacred all the foreigners in
Peking.
A modified version of these rumors re
ceived at Berlin is that the French as well
as the German Minister has been killed.
The English at Shanghai think that the
Chinese had foreign advice in organizing
the defenses at Taku, because of the pre
cision .with which the attack was deliv
ered.
The wires connecting with the - harbor
mines were cut by the boats of the war
ships tho night before the bombardment.
It Is now reported at Shanghai that It
was on boar3 the Russian cruiser Korietz,
and not" the Mandschur. that the explo
sion occurred killing and wounding more
than fifty. It is reported that no fewer
than 700 Chinese were killed in the forts.
Japan Mobilizing an Array.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Dally Express says he Is officially in
formed that Japan is mobilizing 25,000 men
for Immediate transport. All the vessels
of the Japanese Merchant Shipping Com
pany have been chartered.
The British cruiser Undaunted arrived
at Shanghai yesterday, cleared for action
and took up a position commanding the
Chinese forts. There are three Chinese
cruisers in the harbor.
The new Chinese cruiser Hai-Tang,
built by the Armstrongs, has been taken
Into custody at Taku by the British and
Russians. At Turn Nan Fu 6S0 Christians
have been attacked at the French mis
sion settlement, many being put to death.
The French Consul and three mission
aries are still In prison.
The disorderly elements have secured
the upper hand at Wa-Hu and Czechuan,
where the native Christians have been
massacred. A thousand Boxers have
gathered on the outskirts of Tientsin.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Daily News, telegraphing yesterday,
says: "The Chinese officials here assert
that they have news from Peking up to
June 17. The situation was then very se
rious. Beyond that they claim to have
received nothing, but they say that the
dispatches have been withheld.
Seymour in Danger.
"Although I am not willing to adopt the
alarmist reports, my impression, gathered
from the Consuls and the Chinese au
thorities, is that the worst is to be feared
in Peking. Admiral Seymour's column is
now in the middle of an arid plain, with
no food and no good water and surround
ed by hostile forces."
A dispatch from Shanghai announces
that the United States transport Thomas,
with troops from Manila, was diverted to
Nagasaki and has arrived at Taku with
1200 men.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Times, telegraphing yesterday, says:
"The British flag Is reported to have been
flying yesterday over the south gate of
Peking. This Is presumed to indicate
the arrival of Admiral Seymour.
"The summoning of LI Hung Chang
to Peking is regarded as a complete
change of front on the part -of the Man
chus, who have abandoned the hope of
opposing the powers."
The Hongkong correspondent of the
Times says that the Boxer movement is
spreading on West River.
EW YORK. June. 19. âTwo reports have been received from Shanghai ;
} of the arrival of the relief force at Peking. One story Is that Ad-.- 1
,i rr.iral Seymour has hoisted the British flag over the south gate of the
I Chinese capital, while in the other instance the Russian force, as to )
which there have been various hazy references in recent dispatches,
is stated to have arrived outside the walls this morning and to have lame- ,
dlately attacked the city on two sides, employing artillery.
According to this second dispatch the relief arrived In the nick of time,
for a renewed attack had been mad? upon the legations. Apart from this <
it is now live days since any word has been received of the diplomatic corps
and GOO other foreign residents and refugees and 400 odd legation guards In the j
Chinese capital. As far as Admiral Seymour's -action is concerned, it /-was
pointed out by the British Admiralty that the Japanese report- of his return ;
to Tientsin was not confirmed in the dispatches transmitted by H. M. S. Â«
Endymion. while Commander Taus3lg"s reference to the presence of the Brit
ish admiral at the town Is admitted, as pointed out in the Herald yesterday, J
of interpreting that It was Admiral Bruce who had arrived there and not the ,
admiral in command of the relief expedition. ~:vV <.

ccjmment. It Is known to the officials
here that Japan is also, sending a cor
responding number of troops to the seat
of the trouble and that England, Ger
many and France are doing likewise. It
is believed that with our own force, num
bering about 2000, including the Ninth
Infantry, the international army, will be.
quite strong enough to relieve the siege
of the embassies and legations at Peking.
If v a larger number of American troops
should be necessary they will bo sent for
ward as soon as troops can be concentrat
ed at Manila from the outlying posts.
When the official day closed it was
found that a message received in the
morninu from Admiral Remey at the
Navy Department touching the readiness
of the Princeton and Marietta and Zafiro
for immediate service represented all the
news that had come to the Government
from the East slhce yesterday. One fact
of the utmost importance developedâ that
the notice of the Russian Government of
its intention to dispatch 4000 troops to
China was accompanied by an under
standing that these troops were to be used
for the assistance of Europeans and
Americans and with no purpose of terri
torial aggression on the part of Russia. I
This assurance was received with the
greatest satisfaction. It is understood
that Japan, in view of Russia's frank
declaration, will consent to assume the
same obligation toward the other
in which case the greatest obstacle to ef
fective action, whether concurrent or
joint, by the powers in China may be con
sidered as removed.
Lord Pauncefote, the British Embassa
dor, called at the State Department this
afternoon and spent a half hour in con
ference with Secretary Hay. His Lord
ship had no news from his own Govern
ment beyond that conveyed by the morn
ing papers respecting the developments*
In China, and he was particularly anxious
to be informed as to the details of tht>
reported battle Sunday morning.-* The
State Department was without informa
tion on this point. It Is said that Ad
miral Kcmpff will be heard from in a day
or so. The difficulties in the way of a
speedy communication between the Navy
Department and the admiral are illus*
trated In the series of messages that
have come In the last forty-eight hours
from the cable office.
Yesterday the department was informed
that while the wire system beyond Chefu
and leading up to Taku and Tientsin
had been cut. it had been arranged that
a dally steamboat should take messages*
for these points at Chefu and carry
them to their destination up the river.
Though this arrangement Involved a day's
delay, it was acceptable, and the authori
ties were disappointed at receiving to
day the following: notice from the cable
office:
"Cable office reports Chinese adminis
tration canceled arrangements for postal
service from Chefu to Tientsin and Taku.
The Great N/ortbern route through Sibe
ria will do its utmost to get telegrams
through to Tientsin, but messages can
be accepted only at senders' risk."
An ugly feature about this notice is the
disclosure of an apparent purpose on- the
part of the Chinese Government to In
terfere with free communication between
the foreign commanders at Tientsin and
Chefu and fneir respective governments,
an action which may have some bearing
on the decision which must be reached
very shortly as to the status of the re-
lations between China and the other na
tions of the world.
?
GERMAN GOVERNMENT
IS VERY CAUTIOUS
BEBLIN, June 19.â The German Gov
ernment continues to express its opinion
with the utmost caution regarding the
situation in China. Even now it continues
to avoid the use of the word "war," and
still expresses the hope that the Peking
Government is innocent of deliberate hos
tile action. ,
The German press Is outspoken In its
demands for more vigorous steps. The
Vosslche Zeltung says: "Germany, in
conjunction with other powers, will bear
hex* share of the burden of re-establishing
normal conditions, but she will claim an
adequate share of the reward."
An oiRcial of the Foreign Office remark
ed to-day that if the alarming news from
Peking last received were true some con
firmation of it would almost certainly
have reached the coast, adding: "Still,
the Foreign Office is prepared to hear
bad news when any news comes."
The Foreign Office emphasizes the fact
that the Taku forts fired upon the inter
national fleet in answer to a request to
land marines to protect the foreigners in
Tientsin. It is unable to explain the ac
tion of the s Chinese commander except
upon the assumption that he acted under
general orders from Peking 1 .
The Foreign Office has no confirmation
of the report published in a British paper
that the German gunboat Ilti3 was badly
damaged in thÂ« engagement with the forts
and that her captain was killed. It dis
credits the rumors.
A leading official, speaking for the For
eign Office, repeats the denial that the
powers are negotiating regarding the
course of joint action, and says every
thing has been left to the various com
manders, who will simply "perform police
duties." An official dispatch says everv
thing is quiet at Kiaochau. The mother
of the German Minister at Peking, Baron
von Ketteler, in Munster, has received a
telegram from China saying the news of
her son's death is not true.
The Chinese Minister in Berlin has coun
termanded the diplomatic reception for
Friday next, invitations to which had al
ready been issued.

Judge Hebbard Issues Injunction in
New Suit Directed. Against
City Treasurer.
The members of the St. Marys Park
Association have apain succeeded in ty
ing up the $125,000 which had been set
aside for the purchase of property de
sired, but which Judge Seawell decided
could be used to pay the city's bills.
Judpe Hebbard issued an Injunction yes
terday restraining City Treasurer Brooks
from paying out any of the money. The
injunction was issued upon a complaint
filed in the Superior Court yesterday by
Christian Reis. acting on behalf of the
Park Association, against the City Treas
urer. The injunction is only temporary.
The grounds of the new suit are similar
to those of the one decided by Judge Sea
well last week, the only difference being
that this suit is directed against tho
Treasurer. It Is presumed that Judge
Hebbard will hold with Judge Seawell,
but the plaintiff will now be able to ap
peal to the Supreme Court, and the fund
will be tied up indefinitely.

pany, stated that the license would be a
burden on the baxks.
"If you gentlemen want to raise revenue
for the city," said Mr. Chlckerins, "why
do you not place a license on lawyers aaa
doctors?" IV
The Mayor, who was present at the
ineeUne. seemed to be Impressed by the
force of the suggestion and remarked to
Supervisor McCarthy that the proposition
would bear looking up. The Mayor said
that at present the members of the two
professions pay no license. It Is quite
probable that an ordinance on the subject
will be drafted for presentation at the
next meeting ol the board. . . Â¦Â¦'
Judge Allen, representing the banks of
Ban p-ranciuco, was heard in protest
against Increasing the license on savings
and commercial banks.
"Last year," said Judge Allen, "the
Pank of California paid a State license of
JK<6 S5. besides the $300 local license. The
bankf would be oppressed if they have to
pay J600 per quarter. Moreover, all ex
cept national banks must pay a tax to the
Federal Government."
Attorney R.ege::sburger, for the money
lenders, said the new ordinance will force
out of business the money lender who has
but a s-mail amount of capital Invested.
Attorney Chickering thought the new
bill will bring under Its Movfsion all mer
chants who give credit, mr he held that
they are virtually money lenders. The new
ordinance, he Kaid. should be remodeled
eo aÂ« to epecifitsilly et&te who are money
lenders and who are not. The Union
Trust Company paid a war tax of J1S00
last year. A. Dannenbaum represented
thirty money lenders whose receipts in the
aggregate do not exceed J10.000. and he
asked that the ordinance be bo graded as
to exclude the Emaller money lenders.
Consideration of the ordinance went
over until Friday, June 22, when the Joint
Committee on Judiciary and Licenses and
Orders will meet for the purpose.
Attorney Rosenthal appeared for the
manufacturers of billiard and pool tables
in opposition to the ordinance imposing
a license on lessees of the tables. The
committee decided to amend the ordinance
by reducing the tax from $6 to $4 per
quarter, provided that it shall not be im
posed in cases where no charge is made
directly or indirectly for the use of tables.
The ordinance imposing a license of $75
per quarter on advertising fences was in
definitely postponed. Booth and Comte
held that the $10 license now In force
ehould be maintained, so as to allow com
petition in the bill-posting business.

Nicholas Cotter Spent $2000 and His

and Beer.
Nicholas Cotter committed suicide yes

acid in his room in the St. David's House,
715 Howard street. The body was found
shortly after 2 o'clock by a bedmaker.
Two beer bottles, one empty and the other
half full, were found in the room, and a
note scribbled in pencil . by Cotter in
which he stated that he was born in
County Kerry, Ireland, June, 1842, and
was 58 years old. Cotter pawned his
watch for $2 50 last Monday aVul bought
the poison and beer with a part of the
money. - Â¦.
Two years ago Cotter separated from
his family and sold his home, consisting
of a house and lot on Louisa .street, for
$2000. With the proceeds he entered upon
a reckless career of dissipation. His body
lies on a. slab in the Morgue.

Charles Lee, Teamster, Under Arrest
and Sergeant Lewis Under
Detention.
Sergeant Lewis, Battery O, Third Artil
lery, who was under arrest In the guard
house at the Presidio on. suspicion of be
ing implicated in thefts of coal and kero
sene from the quartermaster's stores, has
been released from the guardhouse and is
now confined to his quarters awaiting a
full investigation of the whole affair.
The coal and kerosene claimed to have
been stolen were shown to have . passed
through the hands of Charles Lee, a team
ster at the post, now under arrest in the
City Prison, The coal was sold to a dealer
named Katto, near the Presidio, who said
he purchased nearly thirty sacks from
Lee. Lee claims that the coal he sold he
bought from the other teamsters, to whom
It was allowed by the Government, The
ration of a teamster in the Government
service includes four, sacks of coal a
month, and this is charged off the Gov
ernment's accounts, whether It be taken
by the teamster or left In the bin. The
ttamsters claim they can do what they
please with the- coal if they do not wish
to burn it, and Lee says it was some of
this, that he bought and sold again to
Ratto.
As to the kerosene, the quartermaster at
the Presidio -is Investigating the presence
of nine cans of the oil found under tho
bed in Lee's room, on Moulton street. Tho
Government oil is not marked in any par
ticular way, and the cans found . under
Lee's bed were not marked, so there is no
way to tell positively where the oil came
from. It is suspected that it came from
the Presidio, however, hence the arrest of
Lewis, whose duty it was to keep track
of issues of coal and oil. The post uses
10.000 gallons of oil a quarter and about 75)
tons of coal, so the loss of thirty sacks
of coal and nine cans or forty-five gallons
of oil will be hard to prove.

The closing exercises of St. Rose's Acad

liberal applause and were exceedingly
beautiful. The principal parts were filled
by Genevieve Meherin, Nellie Connors,

was a drill entitled "California's Daugh
ters," in which some twenty young ladies
participated. Each carried a wreath of
golden poppies. In the parlors adjoining
the hall the work done by pupils in China

THE Reverend S. C. Partridge, bishop
of the central diocese of Japan,
one of the most active prose
lyters who has gone forth from
this country to carry civilization
and education among . the peoples of
China and Japan, arrived in this city
yesterday on the Doric. During the after
noon he was at the Occidental Hotel. He
left for the East last night on the over
land train. He will proceed imme
diately to- Uoston, where his American
home is situated.
For the last eighteen years Bishop Part
ridge has been in almost daily cont&ct
with the Chinese in the central provinces,
keeping In touch not only with the social
evolution of the country but also the po
litical changes which have from time to
time rent the- government in the prov
inces of China. He is a man of power as
well as influence and his views on the
present involved political conditions of
the great Chinese empire are interesting
in the extreme.
In 1882, while a traveler in the Shanghai
country, Bishop Partridge became at
tached to St. John's College in Shang
hai.- After three years of arduous work
he returned to America for a further
course of scientific study and then he
packed his traps for the scene of hla
former missionary endeavors. Up the
river about 600 miles to Wuchang he was
sent to advance civilization among a peo
ple who had not yet come in reach of
missionary work. Here he remained more
than thirteen years, until quite recently,
at a meeting of the House of Bishops
(Episcopalian), in St. Louis, he was
unanimously elected to the central dio
cese of Japan with headquarters at Ky
ota. He is now enjoying a nine months"
furlough, at the end of which time he will
return to Japan.
"Most of my work," he said yesterday,
"has been done along the Yangtse river
in the Hupqh province, city of Hangkow,
tho greatest tea market in the world. To
the European travelers it is known ' as
the Chicago of China on account of its
' bristling life and the fact that it is go
ing to be the great railroad center of the
empire. Hangkow lies at the junction of
the Han and Yangtseklang rivers. It is
a great. center of trade and has a popu
lation greater than 2,000,000. It is the
terminal point of the railroad from Pek
ing, built by Belgian and French capfcal,
and will be the Initial point of the new
road extending from Hangkow to Can
ton. The city is really composed of three
distinct cities separated bv the banks of
the river.
j "What Is of particular importance to
Americans is the knowledge ot the vast
business possibilities that awaits them in
this city. The tea business, enormous in
extent and open to all peoples, is largely
. controlled by Russia. The prospect for
American commerce in this district should
hold the minds of our countrymen. The
Chinese are a people slow to reform or
adaptation, but when they realize and ap
preciate the value of new things they ad
here to the innovations as if they were
necessary to their existence. American
articles are consumed here and to illus
trate the Chinese predilection for things
American, the Russians and Germans lind
it necessary, to forge articles of commerce
to represent the form and shape of Amer
ican manufactures." *
Although Bishop Partridge has been
miles removed from ' the . locality ' nf the
Boxer riots and outbreaks, he knows
Chinese politics sufficiently well to hit at
a most plausible reason for their origina
tion. He does not think the disturbances
are as fearful as have been portrayed,
because of his strong belief that all news
has been wired through French and Rus
sian sources. .
"Chinese diplomacy is always rotten."
he continued, "and It Is necessary to dig
deep to find the cause of unsettled condi
tions. All China swarms with marauding
bandittiâ gangs that come from the out
lying districts and fall upon the-peace
fully disposed people in the -towns and
villages. It is a singular thing that Chin
ese soldiers never fire upon rioters, and
that la the. reason why the present out
break has grown to such proportions. The
Chinese Government can protect its own
people if it wishes to do so, and it Is my
firm belief that these rjots have been pro
voked by the Russians and the Germans.
Russia. Germany and Japan are more or
Ipss united in a spirit of aggrandizement.
The , United Â¦: States, England and France
are most anxious to have these riots put
down, looking more for the establishment
of peace and open-door trade possibilities
than the mere possession of land. Of
course the English are most anxious to
sustain control in the great Yangtse Val
ley on account of .its wealth of agricul
tural and mineral products and more par
ticularly, because It la the waterway to
India, and the , Thlbetlan country. This
wav must be kept open for the English.
"There is a strong feeling among mod
ern Chinese to Â¦ get rid ot the reformers
among themselves.' and this Boxer move
ment f is a catspaw.. The -'Boxers would
never have approached Peking unleaa
they .were ordered to do so.. . I have seen
too many of these'uprisjngs not to know
the': moving, forces at work back of this
late onrush. It is the 1 Chinese diplomacy to
play one power against another. What it
will result. in r can easily .be. foreseen. It
will terminate In the partition of the
Chinese empire. :
" "The best friends, of China Â¦ want parti
tionâ a. shakeup that will forever wipe out
the machinations of a selfish, gluttonous
mob, of: office seekers who enrich them
selves at the expense of every Chinese llv
insr.' " .-..-.â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢ - -. ":_Â¦ Â¦ .... -'!.;.â¢Â¦

Mayor to Appoint Committees.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday decided to recommend that the
Mayor be authorized to appoint a com
mittee to investigate the Home for the
Feeble-minded, for which the city has ap
portioned $15,000. A committee will also
inquire into the telephones now used by
the city with a view to doing away with a
sufficient number to reduce the cost to
$7000 yearly, as fixed by the budget.
At the Board of Trade, 202 Market street,
yesterday afternoon there was a meeting
of leauin^ merchants to cons.der what fur
ther stepa should be taken to complete
the work of establishing the Pacific Com
mercial Museum. The merchants were
called together by Irving M. Scott, chair
man of the executive committee, and E.
Goodwin, assistant secretary.
In announcing the object of the confer
ence Mr. Scott submitted a brief state
ment of the work already performed.- He
remarked that the executive committee
commenced active work on April 4 and had
held meetings each week. Seventeen of
the fifty-six chairmen of sub-committees
have performed active work in obtaining
members. The membership at' present
numbers 157. The sunf of $7920 is now in
bank. The amount represents paid initia
tion fees. The expense of the work to date
was $339. The executive committee has
been in communication with Dr. Wilson
of the Philadelphia Museum, and has kept
him Informed of the progress.
Mr. Scott further remarked that the
conference had been called to obtain the
judgment and advice of the merchants on
the subject of electing governors. He in
dicated that the.functions of the executive
committee were limited and that the gov
erning board should be created.
Isaac Upham said: "We ought to have
at least, two hundred members before we
organize. Some of the committees ap
pointed acted promptly and thoroughly,
while others did not. If wo could organ
ize a few more committees we could read
ily run up .the number to 200."
The list of eligible firms, embracing
many of the largest and best known busi
ness institutions in the city, was read by
the secretary. Volunteers were requested
to see merchants In certain branches of
commerce. Among the volunteers were:
Isaac Upham, Hugh Craig, R. P. Jen
nings, A. C. Bates, H. N. Cook, Irving
M. Scott, Sainuel Sussman, M. N. Bates,
E. A. Denicke, J. P. Currier and James
R. Kelly.
Additional members were enrolled&while
the merchants were deliberating. The
volunteers will appoint other sub-com
mittees.
The conference adjourned to meet next
Tuesday at 3:30 p. m. Expressions of the
interested merchants indicate that the
list of membership will be increased to
the required number before the next meet
ing:.

which over 1500 worth of Jewels were

They escaped, and Policeman Robert
Silver took the woman before Captain
Seymour, where Â»he told her story. De
tectives took the case, but nothing of ar.y
importance was accomplished until the
woman's husband, who U a wealthy
manufacturer, played sleuth himself.
The Chinaman hired eight boys, paying
them J2 each to discover the thieves for
him. The.bo>-3 finaJly furnished him the
names of three other youngsters who they
claimed were the guilty parties. Querns
Hlng offered to pay the father of one of

drop if the valuables were returned, but
It was learned that thlÂ» could not be ac

It is said that while the stones could not
be purchased for $500 the boys disposed of
them for the very small sum of li 50. The
officers have located the selling place of
the stuff.
The arrest of young Collins followed and
the officers are now searching for the fwo

will soon leave for China, ami her hus

was that she might take the stolen prop

CONGRESS OF
MINERS OPENS
AT MILWAUKEE
Colonel Montgomery urged action to In
duce Confrress to pass the bill to create
a department off mines and mining ilka
that of the Department of Agriculture,
with a secretary, who should be a member
cf the President's Cabinet. The Introduc
tion of the bill now pending was the re
sult cf thÂ» action of the International
Mining Congress at Salt Lake in 1WW. He
contended that the department should not
be made a mere bureau rn any other de
partment, as It was now in the Depart
ment of the Interior. bÂ«*cauÂ»e then, as
now. it -would be treated as a matter of
Inferior and not of paramount importance
to the country.
T*he speaker recommended action look-
Ing to the thorough revision of the Fed
eral mining laws to the end that minins
on the Government domain should be con
trolled exclusively by the laws of Con
gress and not left to the regulation of en
actments of statutes by the several
States, thus producing a uniformity of
method of location, felze of mining claim,
and annual assessment * work by which
a claim should be perpetuated until a
patent should issue. Such legislation, ho
said, should be based upon the Idea of In
ducing development of mineral wealth
upon the public domain.
He argued also in favor of thÂ© abolition
by act of Congress of what Is generally
known as apex rights, or the right to fol.
low a vein or lead on It into the land of
an adjoining owner, and as a substitute
for thÂ«> apex rights now existing an en

* CHICAGO, June 19.â Presidents of
Western railroads mot here to-day to
evolve some plan ,by which the rate de
moralization might be avoided and the
revenues of their respective roads in
creased thereby. The plan which It Is
believed will be accepted Is precisely a
system of local pools under which the
gross tonnage of the various roads will
be equitably apportioned. The plan wa.i
indorsed in a general way by the presi
dents at their recent meeting In New
York and was turned over to various
committees of different roads to be
framed up In detail.
The details have been considered by the
committees and the whole plan, which
aims to regulate the passenger and
freight business in Western Association
territory, was to-day laid before the
presidents. The plan provides for- the 'du
vision, of territory west of Chicago and
St. Louis into local districts. Chlcago-
St. Paul lines will form one district or
group, Chicago-Omaha lines another
group, and so on, in western passenger
and freight territory. At the head of
eachfjdfstrict will be a committee com.
posed of the traffic officials of each rail
road line in the district. At their head,
according to the plan, there will be a
Joint agent whose duty it will bo to see
that the committee works In harmony
with Itself. , .:. '-Â¦Â¦:. Â¦
At present the plan Is not expected to
be adopted by trans-Missouri and trans

MISS FLORENCE LYSTER. "WHO "WILL Â£e QUEEN FOR A DAY AT
PLEASANTON?
There are few great masterpieces, but,
on the other hand, there are many good
examples of the historical schools of paint
ing, in the London National Gallery. A
visit to it is a good preparation â or the
best possible substituteâ for a tour of the
great Continental galleries. For this rea
son., and because the present paper Is to
be the first of a series on the famous art
galleries of the world, I will follow the
historical method; but instead of aiming
(as is customary) to distinguish the va
rious national and local schools I will try
bo to arrange what I have to say as to
elucidate the general movement In which
the career of each of these schools was
but an Incident. To do this It will be
necessary to mention paintings which are
technically Inferior but | historically im
portant, and to pass over in silence many
clever imitative work*. But, as I have
said, the collection Is cne that leads itself
to thla treatment, and it will apear. I
think, In the end that the epoch making
work, though crude and faulty, offers
more of genuine Interest than the accom
plished but unprogresslve work of a more
advanced period.
The National Gallery is rich in exam
ples of the Italian, Flemish and German
primitives, and we should not be deterred
by their Incomplete technique from giving
them the attention which is their due.
Even as regards technique they show
wonderful development in special direc
tions, and their importance as the first
fruits of modern art need not be insisted
upon. Their painters were the first, after
a long period of formality, to return to
nature, but. it should be added, the best
of them did so with a purpose In view
which binds them closely to the preceding
Byzantine school and which long remained
the dominant purpose in painting. These
were the religious, symbolical painters of
the middle ages, of whom there are many
examples In the collection.
A symbol to be more effective than
Â¦words written on a scroll must have nat
ural significance; to be effective at all we
must not have grown tired of It owing to
constant repetition. But the Byzantine
symbolism was largely of the nature of
written signs to which arbitrary mean-
Ings had been attached, and the world
had begun to be indifferent to It as a
whole. Gradually the . painters of the
middle ages abandoned the more mean
ingless of these signs and put new sig
nificance into the stiff figures, themselves
little more than pictographs. They gave
movement to the limbs, animation to the
features, variety to the grouping. In the
search for new and more effective means
of expression they made a new conquest
of the natural world, and this was in It
self a source of pleasure, to express which
became a new motive for art. Hence we
have In the works of the primitives In
genuous worldllness along with religious
exaltation, scrupulous rendering of fact
together with every artifice of suggestion
beauty of those -works of antiquity -which
were within reach, but the painter's mo
tive â to express the actual feelings and in
terests of the time, worldly or religious,
In such way as his art permittedâ re
mained the same. The painters of the
early renaissance preserve all thÂ« more
charming qualities of the middle ages,
their simplicity', freshness, candor. The
new knowledge of grace did not over
shadow the old Intention. The period Is.
therefore, one of the most interesting in
art. It is well represented In the National
Gallery, particularly on the Italian side.
Vlttore Pisano Is better known as a
medalist than aa a painter, but two of his
rare paintings are here. "St. Anthony
and St. George," with the Virgin appear
ing in a mass, of bright cloud3 over thÂ©
pine wood in the distance, and "The Vis
ion of St. Eustace," illustrating the well
known medieval legend of thÂ« hunter who
was surprised in a forest iy the vision ot
a stag bearing a crucifix between hla
horns, are both good and characteristic
examples. Uccello's "Battle of St. Egidio 1 '
Is noteworthy for the painter's bold at
tempt at foreshortening and for his dec
orative use of values. The gallery con

one of the most Important of the early
Venetians; this great Gothic altarpiece In
which thirteen distinct pictures are set
la one of the gema of the collection. "ThÂ©
Nativity" of Plero della Francesco, In
which, the stable is represented by a
small penthouse and angels like a band of
strolling musicians strum their guitars to
amuse the Child laid upon the ground at
some distance from bis kneeling mother,
was probably suggested by a scene in a
miracle play. Domenico Venezlano's "Vir
gin enthroned," a fresco transferred to
canvas, indicates a return to the Byzan
tine type, but though badly damaged it is
still impressive. There is unfortunately
no example of Albert Durer and only one
or two mediocre heads by Lucas Cranach.
Readers of George Eliot's "Roraola" will
remember the eccentric painter. Piero dl
Cosimo. His "Death of Procris" is a fine
example of the classical story picture.

Penelope Is at her loom with one of her
handmaidens near her: Ulysses enters,
smartly dressed as an Italian navigator of
the period; the suitors draw aside and ap

other: through the open window Ulysses'
ships are seen, safe In port, with sails
furled, and near by is Circe's island, with
her metamorphosed victims prowling
about in thÂ« shrubbery- It Is evident that
the painter would not- understand the fuas
which our art editors and such folk make
about Illustrations that do not follow the
text. He went to Homer for material for
a picture which might convey the sound
moral lesson that there is no place Ilk*
home; he selected his material here and
there in the "Odyssey" and combined It
to suit himself. In the like spirit he has
taken great pains with his perspective,

Mr. Steyn is at Bethlehem, the tem

says It was blown up. Another asserts
that it was undermined by a patrol from
Swaziland, and so collapsed under the
weight of a train. This will temporarily
interrupt the flow of supplies to the
Roers from Lourenzo Marques.
Another list shows nine wounded and
eleven missing in an action at Vredefort

The very latest from China Is that since
the arrival of the foreign marines every
thing has resumed its wonted quiet, arid
the universal question among: the foreign
ers is that of how many more of the same
sort of farces there will have to be before
the fall of the present regime, which has
once more shown Its weakness.
In Japanese' politics the situation re
mains unchanged, with the rumors as to
approaching changes rather more rife
than usual, the general impression being
that Marquis I to v.-ill Boon be at the head
of a new Cabinet, with a strong party
backing.
In the meantime the Japanese press Is
loud in its condemnation of the judicial
barbarism which tolerates the methods
or principle of torture- for the ends of Jus
tice. It Is quite certain that the final re
sult of the incident, if not of a political
character or conducive to a change In the
Korean status, will redound to the cause
of civilization, as in any event it will lead
to some solid guarantee against the repe
tition of the shocking crimes which havo
been committed in the name of justice.
While one war cloud ends It would seem
to be in the very nicic of time, as appear
ances In China indicate that the strong
hand of England must soon fall there, or
things will rapidly Hall into chaos, f he
Impression prevails that either the parti
tion of the vast empire or some arrange
ment for its Joint control by the p.-eis
is close at hana. The Japanese ntebo Is
almost a unit in the expression of the be
lief that the time has come to put an end
to the present farce in Peking and to
overthrow the feeble and corrupt Govern
ment there. Although the outbreak of
the Boxers has not proved so destructive
as at rirst reported, yet their proceedings
were nlgta-handed enougn to prove tnat
either tne tiovernment was in collusion
with them or too weak to efficiently op
pose them. The only couree to be pur
sued was, therefore, the landing of the
foreign marines. The Americans were on
the spot iirst, and it was over the discus
sion of their proposed march to Peicing
that a serious collision took place be
tween the Tsung Li Yamen ana the for
eign Ministers, the former, in the Chinese
fashion, interposing frivolous pretexts for
delay and the latter urgent in their
threats of forcing a way tnrough. Need
less to say, the latter prevailed, adding
another illustration, if it were needed, of
the utter nerveiessness of the Chinese au
thorities. The iact that the Americans
are taking the lead in this new kind of
"open door" "policy is exciting general
comment, every one contrasting the attl
tuue of America toward the Orient two
years ago with the prominent position she
occupies now in everything which con
cerns Kastern politics.
The situation in Korea has In Interest
hardly given place to that in China during
the past week. The Japanese have nat
urally been greatly agitated over it not
only because every sign of the weakness
or blunders of the Korean Government is
eagerlywatched by them but also because
of the horrible tortures inflicted upon two
men who were in a sense the special
wards of this country. The two brothers.
An and Kwong, had fled to Japan on sus
picion of having been implicated In the
murder of the Queen in 1895. The first
named had returned and had been sen
tenced to banishment for three years.
Against the advice of his Japanese
fnt-nds Kwong also lately returned, and
in 6pite of promises made to the Govern
ment here he was seized and put to hor
rible tortures. The so-called confession
thus wrung from him furnished a pretext
for the rearrest of his brother, and both
were then subjected to torture of the most
barbarous nature, resulting In their death.
The Japanese Government has demanded
not only an investigation but the speedy
punishment of all concerned, it being well
known that the "all" would not be cov
ered by the usual "scapegoats" furnished
in such cases. The implications made are
fo vital and serious that Mr. Hayashi. the
Japanese Minister at Seoul, is refused ad
mission to an audience with the Emperor.
It really looks as tf, unless some adjust
ment is speedily made, the long looked for
opportunity for Japan to interfere in the
control of Korean affairs is at hand.
YOKOHAMA, June 2.â On the announce
ment yesterday of the fall of Pretoria
Yokohama's streets were suddenly tilled
with English and American- flags in token
of tne common rejoicing over the end of
the South African war. The pro-English
feeling on the part of the Americans here
has been strongly marked from the begin
ning, and in fact the same is the case ail
through the Orient, where the Americans,
who constitute a VpXf intelligent class,
thoroughly appreciate what it means for
a land to be under -British control. It is
also a significant fact that the Japanese
sympathy for Kngland has been as strong
as it has been unanimous.

coftce is the greatest disturber of diges-

have a fair complexion if she will leave
off coffee and use PoÂ«tum Food Coffee
and nutritious, healthy food in proper
quantity. The food coffee furnishes cer-
tain parts of the natural grains from, the
field that nature uses to rebuild the ner-
vous system, and wheji that is in good
condition one can depend upon a good
complexion, as well as a general
healthy condition of the body.
"Coffee caused dark colored blotches
on my face and body. I had been drink-

gradually app^rcd, until finally they be-

according to directions, I liked it very
much. i.nd have since that time used it
entirely in place of'corTee.
"I am thankful to say I am not ner-

In answering the second question the
Attorney General says that a political
party which polls the requisite number of
votes at the election prior to the coming
primary but fails to poll 3 per cent of the
votes cast In any Railroad Commissioner,
Congressional, Board 'of Equalization.
Senatorial or Assembly District is entitled
to a place and designation upon the offi
cial primary ballot Section 1370 of the
Political Code provides that the same del
egates comprising the State convention
shall be the delegates to the respective
conventions to nominate candidates for
Railroad Commissioners and members of
the State Board of Equalization, and that,
unless It Is otherwise stated, district can
didates for Congress. State Senators and
Assemblymen shall be nominated by the
delegates to the State convention who are
from and reside within such respective
districts. Unless the foregoing construc
tion is given to this section these pro
visions would be meaningless.
In answer to the third question, the At
torney General cites the case of Ilutch
lnson vs. Brown (122 California, page 189),
wherein the Supreme Court of this State
holds that there is nothing unlawful in
fusion: that the statute does not forbid
it or attempt to do so, and it is for the
conventions of different party organiza
tions to decide for themselves whether
their principal objects are so far common
and paramount over minor issues as to
justify Ihem in uniting upon a list of
nominees drawn from. - all parties so
agreeing; and further, that several con
ventions holding separate sessions do not
lose their identity by selecting the same
set of nominees. A somewhat similar
state of facts arose in Minnesota, in the
case of Hlgftlns vs. Berg("6 N. W. TSS).
The Supreme Court of Minnesota held
that where there is "no statutory rule for
ascertaining the approximate vote polled
by the respective parties where there was
fusion, the officer charged with the duty
of printing and arranging the official bal
lot may resort to any means to ascer
tain approximately the vote polled by
each party which he deems to be fah
and practicable, and unless he acts In
the premises fraudulently or unfairly or
clearly on an improper and prejudlcal ba
bIb, his decision will not be disturbed by
the courts. In that case the court uses
this language: "For example, he may
apportion the combined vote between
them on the basis of the average vote
polled by each at the general election
next before the nomination by them of a
duplicate ticket." Basing his opinion
upon this case, the Attorney General ad
vises that Â¦ the procedure outlined by the
Minnesota court be followed.;
section 11S8 of the Political Code provides
that in order to create a new political
party its candidates must poll "an aver
age of 3 per cent of the entire vote at the
election at which they are voted for."
"If this election be the last election
prior to any ensuing primary election,"
the opinion continues, "there would then
be one test applied to parties already in
existence and another and severer test
applied to parties of subsequent birth.
That Is to say, the candidates of the party
already In existence, in order to secure a
place and designation upon the official
primary ballot must have polled 3 per
cent of the entire vote of the State at the
last preceding election, whereas the newly
born party. In order to secure a place and
designation upon the same ballot, must
show that its candidates polled 'an aver
age of 3 per cent of the entire vote of the
State at the last preceding election. Un
less the phrases quoted are to be given
the same construction the law would bo
neither uniform nor equal in its operation
and would therefore be unconstitutional
and void."

prior to the State primary to be held in
August, 1900. entitled to a designation and
place upon the official ballot to be used at
said primary election?
"Secondâ If a political party polled 3
per cent of the entire vote of the State at
the election prior to the State primary to
be held in August, 1900. but failed to poll
3 per cent of the votes cast in any Rail
road Commissioner, Congressional, Boaj-d
of Equalization, Senatorial or Assembly
district, is such political party entitled to
a designation and place upon the official
ballot to be used in such district for the
election of delegates to nominate officers
in said districts?
"Thirdâ At the last general election
neither the Democratic party, the People's
party nor the Silver Republican party
presented any candidate, as their sole
nominee for either Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, Secretary of State, Controller,
Treasurer. Attorney General, Surveyor
General. Clerk of the Supreme Court. Su
perintendent of Public Instruction, Super
intendent of State Printing or Associate
Justices of the Supreme Court, but two
or more of the political parties named
either nominated or Indorsed the same
person for each of the offices mentioned.
Under these circumstances how am I to
ascertain how many votes were polled by
each of the political parties named or
which party or parties are entitled to a
designation and place on the primary
election ticket to be vcted for at the next
primary election to be held on the second
Tuesday in August of this year?"
With relation to the first question. At
torney General Ford says in substance
that under section 1370 of the Political
Code, which is a portion of the new prim
arv election law; it Is provided that "all
political parties who. at the election prior
to any ensuing primary election herein
provided for, â¢ polled at least 3 per i cent
of the entire vote of the State shall be
entitled to a designation and place upon
the official (primary) ballot." The voter
does not cast his vote for any political
party, but for candidates nominated by
that party. Therefore, in order to give
complete meaning to this section of the
code, it should be made to read as fol
lows: "All political parties whose candi
dates at the last election â¢ â¢ â¢ polled at
least 3 per cent of the entire vote of the
State â¢ â¢ ? shall be entitled to a desig
nation and place upon the official ballot."
In computing: the 3 per cent of the entire
vote of thp State polled by the candidates
of any political party it must be upon the
basis, numerically, of the average vote
for the candidates r>f the respective polit
ical parties at such election. The fact is
pointed out that any other construction
â¢would make the primary election law
operate unequally, for the reason that

ON THE BALLOTS
The Grand Grove of California, United
Ancient Order of Druids, opened yester
day morning in its tnirty-sixth annual
session In Druids' Hall on Sutter street
with James F. Martinoni, noble grand
arch, presiding. There were present all
the grand officers and one hundred and
eighty-four representatives from the sev
enty-nine subordinate groves in the Juris
diction.
After the usual impressive ceremonies
connected with the opening of the grand
body the grand grove degree was con
ferred upon sixty representatives who
were entitled to it.
A .congratulatory letter from Supreme
ArcH P. Schaffnit of St. Louis and a tele
gram from Deputy Supreme Arch M. A.
Beckman of Minneapolis were read and
received with applause.
The reports of the grand officers were
after presentation referred to the commit
tee on distribution.
The report of Noble Grand Arch Martin
oni Is a lengthy and able review of the work
done during- his administration and of the
condition of the order. " This shows that
during his term the order did not lose a
grove; that it gained eight new ones and
revived one that had been practically dead
for two vears. and that the net gain in
membership was 1160. The membership
now is 5061.
In his report the noble grand arch re
turns thanks to all who during his term
assisted him In making it the most suc
cessful of that of any noble grand arch in
the history of the order. In relation to
the press he says:
"During the year the press wherever
there are groves of Druids has done much
to attract public attention to Druidism
by publishing notices of elections, Instal
lations, open meetings and official visits.
I desire to call special attention to the
San Francisco Call, which has given in its
fraternal departments great deal of space
to the proceedings of the order. These no
tices have done the order much good."
Grand Secretary Graves' report is a
concise account of the condition of the
order, stated principally in figures. In his
report he says:
"When James F. Martinoni, the noble
grand arch, announced at the beginning
of the year that he Intended to make a
gain of 500 during his term It was looked
upon by many as a vain boast and an
utter impossibility. The year has closed
and the result Is before you, showing a
gain of over 1100. which plainly shows
Â¦what can be done by untiring action and
unceasing effort.
"My association with J. F. Martinoni,
noble grand arch, has been very pleasant
Indeed. I have found him an agreeable
traveling companion, an energetic, zealous
and untiring worker. During the whole
year not a harsh word or unkind thought
has passed between us and you have the
proof before you of the great work he has
accomplished." -- .
At the afternoon RessJon the report of
the committee on appeals and grievances
waB discussed and action was taken upon
the cases.
. In the evening Ihere was an exemplifi
cation of the ritualistic work of the bard,
or second, degree by teams from Laurel,
Galileo and Aurora groves In the presence
of the grand officers, representatives and
those members of the order who ' have
taken the bard's degree.
To-day there will be another session and
In the evening there will be a grand ball
In Odd Fellows' Hall in honor of the mem
bers of the Grand Grove. To-morrow at
II a.' in. the election for grand officers
will be held. -

THE heroic act of John E. Sweeney,
hoseman engine No. 29, in saving the
life of Michael Coyne during a fire
early yesterday morning at 430
Eleventh street, was a theme of praise
in and out of the department . yesterday.
Chief Sullivan was warm In his expres
sions of the bravery of Sweeney and has
given instructions that no expense be
spared to bring the gallant fireman back
to life.
Sweeney rallied somewhat yesterday
morning from the effects of his terrible
burns and there is a strong hope that he
will recover, although he will be ais
flgured for life. He was visited by his
wife and other relatives and friends and
bore up bravely. He was removed to St.
Mary's Hospital and Dr. Bodkins, the de

to his case. t
Acting Captain Thomas J. Bean of en

to Jamison 'Can you make It?' and Jami

and rushed upstairs through the blinding
smoke and saved Michael Coyne's life.
Sweeney is married and has four small
children. He is 31 years of age and a

He sent word by a milkman to the engine

Remarkable Curative Properties of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
1 Stomach Weakness.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a prepara-
tion for the cure of dyspepsia and the
various forms of indigestion and stomach
trouble, owes its great success as a cure I
for thÂ»se troubles to the fact that it la
prepared for disease and weakness of the
stomach and digestive orgrans only, and
! !s not recommended or advised for any
other disease.
It Is not a cure-all, but for any Btom-
: ach trouble it Is undoubtedly the safest,
most sensible remedy that can be ad-
vised with the prospect of a permanent
cure. It Is prepared In tablet form, pleas-
ant to taste, composed of vegetable and
fruit essences, pure pepsin and Golden
Seal, every one of which act effectively
In digesting the food eaten, thereby restÂ«
lnjr and Invigorating the weak stomach;
rest Is nature's cure for any disease, but
you cannot rest the stomach unless you
put Into it something that will do its
work or assist In the digestion of food.
That is exactly what Stuart's Dyspep-
Bia Tablets do; one grain of the digestive
principle contained In them will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or similar -whole-
some foods. They will -digest the food
whether the stomach Is in working order
or not. thereby nourishing the body and
resting the stomach at the same tima
and rest and nourishment Is nature's cure
for any weakness.
In persons run down In fleah and ap-
petite these tablets build up the strength
and increase flesh, because they digest
flesh-forming food which the weak stom-
ach cannot do; they increase the flow of
gastric juice and prevent fermentation,
acidity and sour watery risings. Â¦ â¢ Â¦
Stuart's Dyspe;Â»ia Tablets can be fownd
at all drug stores at 50 cents per package.

POLICE DETERMINED
TO CLOSE POOLROOMS
Lieutenant Birdsall, Under Instruc
tions, Buys Pools and Makes
Four Arrests.
Notwithstanding the injunction asked
for by the poolsellers, Harry Corbett,
Zick Abrams, D. J. Crowley and Henry
Schwartz, to restrain Chief Sullivan from
interfering with their business, the Chief
yesterday issued instructions to arrest
them if these men were selling pools.
It was at first decided to swear out com
plaints for their arrest, but later Lieuten
ant Birdsall was Instructed to visit the
poolrooms and make arrests. The lieu
tenant went first to the rooms of Henry
Schwartz under the Cafe Royal and
bought a pool on the Hanrihan-West fight
at Coney Island. He at oneÂ© placed
Schwartz under arrest and took him to
the City Prison. Schwartz was booked on
the charge of violating the poolselling or
dinance and was released on ?50 cash bail,
accepted by Assistant Warrant Clerk
Greeley.
The lieutenant followed the same pro
cedure at the other poolrooms, and Harry

and released on the-patne ball. The cases

The movement to construct a cycle path
between this city and San Mateo was
given a good start at a meeting held by
the Cycle Board of Trade last evening.
Committees on finance and organi
zation were appointed, and a considerable
discussion was held as to the best avail
able route.
Until the route Is definitely decided the
probable co3t will be hard to estimate. A
communication was read from President
Woodson of the California Associated
Cyclists, giving eomo statistics of other
paths now .constructed in the State, where
the cost varied from ten to two hundred
dollars a mile, according to the ground,
necessity for grading, bridges and cul
verts.
Southern California now has fifty-six
miles of cycle path constructed. Other
paths In the State are: Sacramento to
Folsom, 22 miles; Auburn to Rocklin, 29;
Sajcramento to Gait, 24: Sacramento to
Brighton, 5; Oak Park, Sacramento Coun
ty, â¢*; Vallejo to Napa, 18.
Charles Albert Adams was elected pres
ident of the meeting and James M. Ham
ilton secretary. Mr. Adams called for ex

and nearly Â©very delegate present had
some ideas to express. Willia'm MaciTie
of the Olympic Wheelmen thought tne

of the property along this route, but he
thought a right-of-way could be secured.
He thought the Mission road could be
used, but not the bay road, as It is too
narrow.
Joseph Holle and W. J. Kenny favored
the bay road as the favorite scenic route
south from the city^. Kenny said the bay
road could bo widened. t>ut Mr. Mackie

in another week or so will be ready for
her trial trip. She is the handsomest
piece of marine architecture ever turned

Twenty-Ninth Session of the Califor
nia Tooth Doctors â Papsrs, Clin
ics and Sharp Criticisms of
Recent Methods.
Â»
The spiciest thing about yesterday s
meeting of the California State Dental As
sociation at the Young Men's Christian
Association hall was tbe covert whacks
taken by the president, Walter F. Lewis
of Oakland, at the State Board of Dental
Examiners. The memory of last Septem
ber's scandal evidently rankled among his^
listeners, for when he closed the address'
In which his allusions were made there
was visible a marked eagerness to com
ment on his speech.
Dr. Lewis thinks that the power of nom
inating the board should be vested solely
in the dentists, and not, as it is at the
present time, with political laymen. The
third vice president of the association, Dr.
P. L. Platt, advocated and indorsed the
president's views.
"As the matter stands at present," said
Dr. Platt, "the man with a pull gets on
the board, while others, perhaps more
suited fo.r the position but without influ
ence, have to keep out."
Tooth doctors who resort to advertising
of the Incandescent character also came
In for a grilling at the hands of the presi
dent. He said that such practitioners
were ruining the profession, and by their
fraudulent methods were heaping odium
on the reputable dentists>
More abstruse entrance examinations to
the dental colleges were advocated by Dr.
L. A. Teague as a purge for this class of
practitioners. -This speaker also wanted
the number of colleges regulating limited
to three â one in New York, one In Chicago
and one in San Francisco.
The morning session of this the twenty
ninth annual meeting of the California
Sta;e Dental Association was called to
order at 10 o'clock yesterday morning by
President Walter F. Lewis of Oakland.
The hall was fairly filled with a repre-.
sentative gathering of California dentists..
The session this year Is to last four days.
Three of these will be given to clinics and
professional papers, the fourth to a dinner
or some festivity.
The reading of the papers contributed
by members of the committee on dental
literature and education occupied the
morning session. An interesting paper on
that subject by Dr. T. T. Dunbar of San
Francisco was read by Dr. W. J. Taylor
of Sacramento, the author being unable
to be present. The paper which excited
most Interest was that of Dr. Amy J.
Bpwman of San Francisco on "Woman In
Dentistry" Dr. Bowman In this paper
recommended that a superficial knowledge
of dental science be made a part of all
public-school currlculums. . Â¦ â¢
A supplementary report on dental liter
ature and education was read by Dr. W.
J. Taylor. Dr. J. M. Haider of Oakland
contributed a supplementary report on
"Dental Therapeutics."
In the afternoon several cases were
operated on before the meeting.
At the evening session besides the presi
dent's address Dr. A. C. Hart of San
Francisco delivered a lecture on "Crown
and Bridge Work," illustrating his points
with the aid of the blackboard.
The membership applications of twenty
dentists have been received by the secre
tary. The second session will begin at
10 o'clock this morning. This year's clin
ics are as follows:
"Bleaching Teeth With Peroxide of So
dium," Dr. J. T. Grant of Woodland:
"Filling Canals In Abscessed Teeth With
Creosoted Charcoal Points." Dr. E. C.
Tait, Oakland; "Replacing Facings by
Means of Dr. Bryant's Bridge Repair
Tools," Dr. \V. J. Taylor, Sacramento:
"Root Calan Fillings With Silver Points,"
Dr. S. L. Strickland, San Francisco; "Root
Canal Drying." "Contour Approxlmal
Filling With Moss Fiber Gold," Dr. F. C.
Pague, San Francisco; "Making and Tem
pering Instruments," Dr. F. W. Harnden,
San Francisco; "Porcelain Inlay," Dr. A.
H. Wallace, San Francisco; "Porcelain
Molar Crown," Dr. F. L. Platt, San Fran
cisco; "Combination Cohesive and . Non
cohesive Gold Filling In Occlusal Cavity,"

Merrlman Jr., Oakland; "Treatment of
Blind Alveolar Abscess," Dr. George E.
Daniels, San Francisco; "Porcelain
Work," Dr. J. C. Cummlngs. San Fran
cisco; "Tho Treatment of Erosion and
Abrasion," Dr. L. A. Teague, San Fran
cisco.
The following are the officers of the as
sociation who are managing the present
meeting: President, Walter F. Lewis,
Oakland; first vice president, A. F. Merrl
man Jr., Oakland; second vice president,
A. M. Barker. San Jose; third vice presi
dent, F. L. Platt, San Francisco; record

Ing nearer the city than the ocean boule
vard. He said It was the natural way out
of the city toward San Mateo, and only
offered two Tades of any Importance, and
these two were easily negotiable.
President Adams impressed upon the
delegates present that the undertaking
was a stupendous one, confronted as they
were with uncertainty as to route and the
difficulty of securing money to bui-M the
path. He saiu the cycle dealers ought w>
.contribute liberally, as they would be the
most benefited by the improvement. Then
help should come from the Individual rul
ers and also from road houses along the
route. He diu not expect much aid, ho
said, from San Mateo people. They did
not want to get into San Francisco, but
the San Francisco people wanted to pet
out of the dry by the easiest route." He
said the i^ea w.ts not to' build a wheelway
where there was a good road already, but
to have the Supervisors of each county
set aside say six feet of the road and pass
ordinances devoting its use solely to cy
clers and pedestrians. Where the road
was already good no Improvement would
be needed. Otherwise a cinder path or
board path could be built. A route com
mittee was appointed, consisting of C. N.
Ravlin (chairman), William Muckie, J.
Cornell. Edwin Goeller. S. G. Scovern and
P. G. Montealegre. The finawes will do

Fifteen years ago Mr.
George Gooderham, of
Toronto, took out
i>-Year Endowment
Policy No. 289,421 for
5100,000, in the Equit-
able Life Assurance So-
ciety, paying an annual
premium of Â§8,382.
Now his policy has ma-
tured and shows the
following results :

$150,847.'

Assurance,
$210,000./

Annuity

$20,320.
At the same time Mr.
Gooderham took out
a policy of the same
kind for the same
amount and with the
same premium, in an-
other company ; the
cash return on which
was $15,000 less than
on the Equitable policy.
Here is what Mr.
Gooderham says of his
results :
"I' have always been a"
"strong advocate of En-"
"dowment Insurance, and"
"about the time I took"
"your policy for $100,000"
"I placed $400,000 of En-"

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. June 19â The liquidation of
Btocka was rather decisively checked to-day
and as was to be expected after the consider
able decline of yesterday and -Saturday there
was a aufadent demand from outside shorts to
accomplish a rally In prices. There was no
evidence of any buying outside this narrow
professional circla and the demand .dwindled
away to practically nothing as prices rose
en enlarging fraction over last night's level.
The room traders turned to the long elde and
attempted to bid up prices against the shorts,
but they met very Blight success and a late
break In the New York traction stocks caused
a reaction all around and wiped out pretty
much all of thÂ» early gains. The Belling
through commission houses, which was the
most striking evidence of weakness in yester
day's market, indicating as lt did the letting
fro of stocks by third Investment holders, was
on a small ecale to-day. Selling orders of this
character caused reaction after the opening
rise in sympathy with London and the bears
started to put' out short Unee. But they soon
detected the cessation of liquidation. The large
borrowing demand for stocks last night had
**rved as a warning to the bears that the
short Interest was becoming rather unwieldy
end they foITbwed London's example and
started to cover. The market then fell back
Into Its purely professional character and
drifted rather aimlessly for the rest of the
(Jay. net changes being. flight. The steel group
was Jncjlned to weakness, with the exception
of Federal Steel, which was firm on expecta
tion of dividend action on the common this
afternoon. Union Pacific, both common and
preferred, end Pacific Mall showed notable
rtrength. The cessation of liquidation seems
to have been caused by a revised estimate of
the motive of the strength In the wheat mar
ket, additional importance being given to the
fears of European complications over China
and less apprehension being felt over the crop
situation. - The fact that foreigners were cell
ing somewhat In this market to-day did not
â¢term to affect this feeling. Growing atten
tion Is being paid to the money market out
look in view of the shipment of gold to Ger
many to-day anfl the Intention to make further
rhipments to France on Thursday. It lÂ«-felt
that thin drain on New York's low level of
purplus reserves. Joined to domestic conditions,
rnuet have an early effect on the local mone>
market. The demand from Berlin Is said to
be for the purpose of meeting the need of the
semi-annual settlements on July 1. This would
leave a short period for the continuance of the
demand. The Bank of England lost gold to
Germany to-day and a symptom of It* dis
satisfaction was the rising of the price of gol&
New York Stock Market.
CHICAGO, June 19.â The wheat market
opened to-day nervously and remained In that
condition throughout the day. In the North
west while there 'were some, rains the situa
tion was unchanged. Southwestern sections
sent in some favorable advices and bears
called attention to the unresponsive attitude
of foreign markets ' to advance. The French
crop was also reported to have derived some
benefit from seasonable weather. July wheat
opened %c to %c under yesterday at 78%c to
78c, and rallied sharply to 79&c under the In
fluence of good gains at Minneapolis and Du
luth. Over 7Â»e, however, there were millions
of bushels for sale and under enormous pres
sure from longs combined with some Blacken
ing in the demand, July broke from the top
to 77c. On the dip sold-out bulls and ' others
bought and the outside demand showed some
thing; of Its form, causing a rally to 78%c.
Again the bulls were unable to bold their po
sition and July broke to 77%c, closing l%@l^ic
under yesterday at 77ftc.
Â¦Corn, while quiet, . was steady. July closed
%@<4c lower at 3SKc ' â¢
In oats trade was largely a matter of chang
ing July and September. The close was %c
under yesterday at 23%c for July. . â¢
Provisions were dull. The market opened
steady, but eased off on moderate liquidation.
Hog receipts were light, but the ' market felt
the wheat break. July pork closed 2%c down
and lard and ribs each lost 6c.

NEW YORK STOCK LIST,
% of a penny an ounce. The price of American
eagles was at the same time advanced half
a penny an ounce, raising the question whether
the British institution Is to Join In the de
mands being made on New York for gold, with
the sab-treasury Just now making heavy dis
bursements on account of pensions, which have
been sufficient since Friday to offset the pay
ments made by the banks for the gold ex
ports. But the $5,000,000 Government deposits
called in by the Government are due next
Monday and no part of the installment has
yet been paid by the banks. Meantime New
York exchange at Chicago fell from 30c to 20c
premium. Indicating a decline in the flow of
currency from the interior to New York.
The bond market was dull and prices went
lower. Total sales, par value, $1,275,000.

NEW YORK, June 19.â Ths Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
Chinese situation continued to depress all the
markets here, though In the afternoon there
were some signs of a recovery on a rumor that
the powers had aEked Japan to undertake the
taek of dealing with the Chinese. London
bought American stocks on this report. When
New York, after opening lower and hesitating
finally followed the London lead, prices rallied
a good deal and the close here was at the b&st.
Copper shares were weak on selling by Berlin
and Paris. Discounts were firm at 2%. Money
was easy. The Bank of England sold Â£199,000
gold in German coin, also Â£7000 for a destina

Bartlett Pears appeared from the river, sell

Peaches are scarce and firm at the good
prices, and the early crop Is turning out short.
Apricots are steady, with decreased stocks,
and the canners were obliged to advance their
bids yesterday to obtain supplies. It seems that
the canners' j combine are not getting, fruit as
low down as Â¦_ was thought early in the season,
as wherever their buyers go they are followed
up by the Eastern buyers, who bid 5 per cent
over them. This is causing considerable laugh
ter among the trade.
Supplies of Plums are lighter and prices are
not as low as they have been. Figs, too. are
doing rather better. Apples are in heavy sup-
Berries continue cheap and plentiful, with
the exception of Logans, which are turning out
a short crop. '

Nephew of Mrs. Catherine Garcelon
Alleged to Be in Danger of ,
Spoliation by Designing 1
Persons.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 19.
Following closely his petition to be ap
pointed guardian of the children of James
P. and Mary Webster Merritt and Fred
erick A. and Mary Browne Merritt, Attor
ney Horace W. Philbrook to-day applied
for letters of guardianship on tne estate
of James P. Alerritt, who he declares to
be an incompetent person.
According to the petitioner, James P.
Merritt is, by reason of his weakness of
mind, mentally incompetent to manage
what property remains to him out of the
valuable estate inherited frojn his uncle,
the late Dr. Samuel Merritt, and is In con
stant danger of being deceived and im
posed upon by artful and designing per
sons. By reason of his mental condition
Merritt is said to be in imminent danger
of being stripped and despoiled of nis
property and left penniless and destitute.
With regard to Frederick A. Merritt.
Philbrook asserts that he has from child
hood exercised a complete mental ascend
ency over his brother, James P. Merritt,
and that being also incompetent to man
age his financial affairs he is likely to be
used by artful and deceiving persons as
a. tool for deceiving and imposing upon
James P. Merritt.
James P. Merritt was at one time the
possessor of a large estate, recites the pe
tition, but because of his incompetency
and the wrong advantage taken of him
by different persons he has been stripped
of almost his entire belongings, except a
few personal effects of trifling value and
a part ownership in heavily mortgaged
Oakland real estate^
The estate of the late "Catherine M.
Garcelon, the aunt of James and Fred
erick Merritt. is brought to the front by
Philbrook. He declares that the contest
to their aunt's will instlttuted several
years ago by the Merritts is a just action
and that if a proper guardian be appoint
ed they may realize on their claims
against the estate. The estate is valued
at over $1,000,000.
It is for the purpose, concludes the peti
tion, of preventing unscrupulous persons
from despoiling him of his possible share
in the Garcelon estate that a guardian is
needed for James P. Merritt.
The petition of Attorney Philbrook is
general In its statements regarding per
sons who would defraud Merritt. It
makes no specific accusations.
He Would Be Guardian of
the Father as Well as
of the Children.
PHILBROOK SAYS
JAMES MERRITT
IS INCOMPETENT

Demands.
ALAMEDA. June 19.â Although Division
Superintendent Frazier of the Coast
Division has said that he would con
sign to the waste-basket any petition
the citizens of Alameda might present
urging improvement In the narrow-gaugo

a lengthy document. It recites the In
conveniences the traveling public is com
pelled to put up with In the way of
crowded and unsanitary cars, delayed

mand is made for a change from narrow

pointed out that turntables should bo
placed at each of the terminals so that

der running "head on." thereby minimiz
ing the number of accidents on account

In answer to the statement of Superin
tendent Frazier that Oakland was given
the broadgauge service so that Alameda's
narrow-gauge service could be Improved
the petition seta forth that the superior
service is discrimination in favor cf tho
former city against the latter, which suf
fers materially from the effects of poor
train service.

mand better service the Board of Trus
tees will forward to railroad headquarters

from the fall he received. Kramer was on
a car when he saw the horses running.
It .was at a time when Market street was
crowded with pedestrians, and he con
cluded to stop the animals even at the risk
of his own life. He Jumped from the car
and climbed Into the seat of the wagon.
After two blocks had been covered he suc
ceeded in almost bringing the horses to a
halt, when one of the reins broke and he
was thrown to the street. One of his legs
became entangled in Â¦ the remaining line
and he was dragged some distance before
he could disentangle : himself.

Two Factions Formed, Eacli Seeking
to Oust the Other From
Power.
"WASHINGTON, June 19.â Two gather-
Ings of the Knights of Labor of North
America, each claiming to be the regular
and legally constituted executive body of
the order, were in full swing here again
to-day, each assembly having for Its
avowed object of deposing and - re
moving from office of the rival faction.
Neither faction expects to fully accom
plish what It has set out to do without
invoking the aid of the civil courts; and
even then it seems doubtful if a split in
the organization can be averted.
The faction headed by General Master
Workman Parsons heard.the report of the
general executive boaru submitted by
John A. Connor. It recommended that the
charter of the District of Columbia As
sembly be revoked; that Secretary John
W. Hayes be removed from oftice and
title be secured to the property of the
order in this district. Without action fur
ther than referring the recommendations
to the proper committees the assembly
adjourned.
General Worthy Foreman J. D. Cham
berlain of Colorado presided over the de
liberations of the Hayes faction and heard
the report of the committee on appeals
and grievances. This report recommended
that Parsons, O'Keefe, Conners, Arm
strong and Unks be expelled from the or
der on 'charges of misconduct made
against them by local Assembly No. 300.
RUMORS CURRENT THAT
H. CLAY EVANS MAY RESIGN
SPLIT OCCURS IN
THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, June 19.
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton de
murred to-day to the indictment agrainst
him and the accusation demanding his
removal from office, and while Judpe Hall
took the demurrers under advisement un
til next Thursday It is probable, from his
remarks from, the bench, that he will hold
the demurrer against the indictment as
good, if not that against the accusation.
"An effort Is being- made tu get Dalton
on the stand," said K. M. Fitzgerald, his
attorney, "and so I have interposed a de
murrer to both the indictment and the ac
cusation. They are not sufllcient to hold
him." So a long- and technical fl&ht was
Tnude ajjainst the form of the indictment,
which was followed by the same kind of a
tight, though not so long, against the ac
cusation.
Mr. Fitzgerald took the Ftand and de
clared that the form of the indictment
was not sufficient because it did not
how the destroyed books became
public records. He asserted that they were
not public records, and that the statutes
did not require that they be kept. To
this District Attorney Allen replied that
he had a number of decisions to cite to
show that the records of a public officer
became public records by operation of
law. Mr. Fitzgerald thÂ«-n declared that if
this were the position taken by the Dis
trict Attorney, the indictment was defec
tive in tha.t it did net set out how these
records became public records.
Air. Kitzgrerald took the position that the
assessment roll of the county did not be
come* such until it was turned over to
the Board of Supervisor.*, and that the
destroyed books never having been turned
over to the Suxx?rvisors and the law not
requiring that they be turned over to the
Supervisors, they never became public
records. He also lodged several objec
tions to the form and sufficiency of the
indictment.
Upon the accusation Mr. Fitzgerald held
it was Insufficient in that it did not state
the names of thone whom it is alleged the
County Assessor left off of the personal
property roll.
Judge Hall took both demurrers under
advisement, and will render his decision
upon them on Thursday.

Support the Demurrer to the In
dictment, but Takes It
Under Consideration.

SAYS MR. DALTON
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 19.
With $3 in their pockets and with hearts
as Mght as their purses Claude Raymond
Harris and Alice Genevieve Phillips eloped
from San Francisco to-day. They braved
the dangers of the voyage across the bay
and landed about 10 o'clock this morning
at the County Clerk's office, bent upon se
curing all of the necessary and prelim
inary legal paraphernalia to a quiet little
wedding.
But after the love-sick groom had part
ed with $2 for a marriage license he count
ed up and found he had left only SO cents.
There was not a Judge within hailing dis
tance, and the youthful elopers found that
Oakland Justices of the Peace do not
marry on the cut-rate fee basis. So the
cup of happiness, nearly full, Â¦was almost
shattered. The law allow* a Justice of
the Peace $3 as a marriage fee. The
would-be groom was shy exactly $2 20.
For five hours the pair sat on the court
house steps discussing their troubles,
when kind fortune in the person of Ray
mond T. Baker, deputy county clerk, hove
in sight.
Baker issued the license In the morning,
and a? he drifted back from his lunch he
observed the dejected pair. Something im
pelled him to address them. They poured
out their tale of woe, and it reached sym
pathetic ears.
"Oh, is that all? I'll fix that in a min
ute," said Baker, Jauntily. "I've got a
friend up the street who will attend to
you. Come along."
All smiles, the couple, escorted by the
clerk, headed up Broadway and speedily
were in the presence of Police Judge Mor
timer Smith.
"Some friends of mine," cheerily an
nounced the guide. "You fix them up, old
man."
Nothing loth to accommodate the blush
ingr couple and his friend Baker, the Jus
tice, after examining the license, tied the
knot.
"You are now man and Â¦wife," declared
the Judge, and, sotto voce, "the fee Is $3."
"Oh, I forgot to say," interrupted 'Baker,
"that they are a little shy. But I'll be re
sponsible for that, old man."
The marriage license will be returned to
the voung people indorsed, "No fee col
lected." They reside at 3S Perry street,
San Francisco.

at I the same time extinguishing the
sparks which threatened to totally de
stroy her luxuriant hair. She sustained
painful burns about the hands and arms
while attempting to throw the blazing hat
into the aisle of the church.
The sight of the woman's head all
ablaze alarmed the congregation to such
an extent that for a few minutes a panic
appeared imminent. A dozen z^~.i sprang
to the assistance of Mrs. Lawrence, while
several women fainted. When quiet was

they , are adapted for the assemblage of
cases containing storage batteries, for
example, and for their exterior coverings,
for chemical apparatus, galvanic piles,
etc. . s They, are secure from all danger of
induced currents, which are always to be
feared j when metallic mails are used, con
ducting wires can also be replaced to ad
vantage with hard rubber hooks. The in
sulating coverings are then less exposed to
deterioration, and short-circuiting is com
pletely avoided. Finally, the fact that
these, "hard-rubber nails" are bad . con
ductors, of electricity, and^that they are
insensible to magnetic attraction, makes
them valuable in the construction of deli
cate'laboratory apparatus, measuring in
struments, electric switchboards, etc. No
spark cart result from contact # between
these nails and. a hammer or other tool,
so that their, use is specially recommend
ed in the manufacture of explosives and
in all places where these substances are

SHOW ON BRANNAN STREET
In the meantime the people 'of Oakland
will rehearse the facts of the case In.
which they are so intimately interested.
They know that on questions of fact
the decision of the trial court Is final
his appointment of Judge Hart .was tnere
fore Illegal. The Supreme Court granted
the writ of prohibition yesterday and
Judge Hart, temporarily, at least, is re
lieved from the burden of that duty which
rests so heavily upon him. The writ has
been made returnable-on June 25 and until
then nothing can be dr.no.
and that If that court accepts the valua
tion . of the '. Contra Â¦ Costa Water Com
pany as the: corporation claims it to bo
the Supreme Court* will not question the
decision. This valuation is $8,000,000,
which, under any form of analysis seem?
not to boar inspection. The original cap
ital, stock of the Contra Costa Water
Company was $3,000,000, and the bonded
debt was f2,000.000. This capitalization of
the corporation .was Increased- by vote pf
the directors to $6,000,000. Then the d<?ai
with the Hnyward company was made
The situation was becoming more in
tenee every day until on Monday Attor
ney Robert Y. Hayno. filed: a p petition bo
fore the Supreme Court asking that trib
unal to prohibit Judge Hart from acting
In the case. Hayne pleaded in his peti
tion that as Judge Ogden was not-quali
fied to try the case he was not qualified
to name tna Judse who should uu so and
Even an assertion of mistaken Identity
did not swerve him from his Spartan sense
of duty. Judge Ogden listened to the roar
of protest which followed his selection "
and said that he thought he had chosen
A. L. Hart, not E. C. Hart of Sacramen
to. In making this explanation Judge Og.
den probably forgot his political history
and did not remember that A. L. Hart of
Sacramento never was a Judge. But still
Judge Hart was proof against removal.
He overruled the demurrer 'of, the, people
of Oakland, and when they appealed- to
rae the books decided that they could not
ask for a blanket order, but -must specify
the particular books they, desired.
This selection precipitated another storm
which hoc given to the complicated affair
a political phase. The people of Oakland,
through their attorney. Kobert T. Hayne,
objected to Judge Hart, but Judge Hart
decided that he was fully competent \o
act. He, therefore, overruled the objec
tion. His sense of duty, It appears, was
more keen than his personal pride. He
knew that he was an associate of Alvinza
Hayward, the actual plaintiff in the case,
in political affairs, but no one could say
that the jurist from Sacramento was a
ratepayer to the water monopolist. Judge
Hart probably thought that politics makes
strange bedfellows, and . he was not â¢ de
terred. He had been elected, at bis own
earnest solicitation, a delegate to the Re
publican National Convention, â¢ but again
his sense of duty asserted itself and 'he
determined to sacrifice his personal desires
and judge a case In which the corpora- .
tlon plaintiff was fighting for him, and the
defendant,' with whatever courtesy .the
8ituati6n permitted, was asking him to
retire. Judge Hart decided not to go , to
the national convention, but to remain In
Oakland and try the case. Â¦
The case was assigned to Judge F. B.
.Ogden, who decided that as a ratepayer
to the lltiguous corporation he was dis
qualified under the law. The other Su
perior Judsres of Alameda were In the
same position, but Judge Ogden was not
at a loss for an expedient. He decided
that because he was disqualified himself
tnat was no reason why he could not
choose the Judge who would be qualified
to try the case. This decision of Judge
Ogden Is at least Interesting if it is not
remarkable, and out of it came yesterday
an order of the Supreme Court of the
State which temporarily suspends all pro
ceedings in the case. Judge Ogden, not
withstanding his own' decree that he had
no power to act Jn the case, selected Judge
E. C. Hart of Sacramento to act In his
stead. . Â¦ â¢â¢-.;. â¢
Oakland was shocked and the battle be
pan In the City Council. After due con
sideration the Council decided that the
company would bo fairly compensated by
an Interest of 6 per cent on a valuation a
trifle less than J4.O00.O50. Upon this basis
the water rates were fixed last" February
by the Council. It was the turn of the
Contra Costa Water Company to be
shocked. A vision of enormous profit had
vanished and the company instituted suit
to have the rates established by the
Council declared null and void. .Two rea
sons were given for this action, one be
ing that certain Irregularities in the fix
ing- of the rates had made them illegal and
the other that a sufficient income to the
company had not been assured.
The attorney? for the people of Oak
land will have therefore an extremely
difficult task to force into . court some
thing which does not exist. However
specific the demand may be, it cannot
be honored. When the new corporation
had rid Itself of the burden of telltale
books, preparations were made to meet
the City Council on the question of
rates. The war of the two companies
had so oaten Into profits that the need
of substantial returns' was immediate.
The company decided to be extremely lib
eral to Itself, and so when the question
of rates was presented the company de
manded 7 per cent interest on a capital
ization of JS.000,000.
grlmage was made to a point convenient
ly near the power-house and the books
ceased to exist. s-'v-
Leading Actors in the Litigation Which Is Interesting the State.
THE struggle cf the Contra Costa
Â¦\Vater Ccmpany to force the people
of Oakland to pay water rates upon
what is claimed to be an exag
gerated valuation of a raper c Â°r
pcratlon has reached a stage in which the
cr.tlre State is interestÂ«^l. Tho water com
pany insists that it shall receive Interest
upen a certain capital, which is computed
no one knows how or why. The people of
Oakland, through the attorneys omploye-1
by the City Council, stand ready to guar
antee the water company *a fiir interest
upon a bona Jide cjipital. but they de
mand to know how that capital has
reached thV proportions which the lawyer.*
for the water company claim. The only
apparent method of determining th!s is-
Bue, which is of importance to every mu
nicipality in the State, is to produce and
examine the books and discover frcrn
them whal the' water coir.par.y will not
tell the sources of its capitalization.
The corporation submits its stock and
bond issues and whnt purports to be a
record cf actual expenditures in construc
tion and running expenses. Nothing but
the worn of corporation officers la sriver.
to support the.Â«e representations and the
attorneys for the people of Oakland de
mand that the original records of the mul
titude of transactions, the books of the
water company, be produced in court to
show that the stock has not been inflat
ed and that purported expenditures have
been genuine. This demand has been
stubbornly resisted. The Judge, who is
trying the case under conditions of the
most apparent interest, has declared that
the attorncyp for Oakland have no right
to demand all the book*, but must ask
rpecincaily for the records which they
need. The merits of this demand was to
have been argued to-day, but however
the Issue may be determined the fact will
remain that the books of the . Contra
Cceta Company, which could have any
beralnjj upon the case, cannot be pro
duced. They have been destroyed, it is
reported, and the most emphatic order of
the highest court In the State could not
brlnÂ£ them Into evidence.
Those who should be in possession of ac
curate information of affairs concerning
the Contra Co5ta Water Company declare
that the essential books have been burned
tnd that whatever the court may decide
it rrrust accept or reject the ngTires of
capitalization aÂ« they have been presented
by the officials of the company. This
raises the : vitally Important question
â¢which le of moment to the municipalities
of the State. Shall the people of cities of
the State be compelled to pay quasi-pub
llc corporations interest upon valuations
which can neither be investigated nor
questioned? These valuations may be the
&â¬g-reÂ£&te of corporations which exist on
paper. Stock Inflation may be suspected
out not proved without the records. Ex
penditure* upon which interest must be
paid may be claimed and without the
bocks nothing- can be questioned-
TnÂ«se are the vital Issues in a case
which has agitated Oakland and which
now baa assumed a phase of Interest to
the entire State. Scandal has followed
ecasdal In the affairs of the Oakland
wÂ»ter companies. For years the Contra
Coeta "Water Company and the Oakland
"Water Company were bitter rivals for
patronage, in the struggle for which re
course was had to the most dangerous ex
pedients. Agents of both concerns fought
Â¦with one another. Valuable property was
destroyed, reputations were ruined and
Councils were bribed. For a while the
people of Oakland enjoyed the benefits in
reduced water rates resulting from this
remarkable competition.
Then the climax came In a compromise
between the two fighting companies. The
Contra Co6ta Water Company absorbed
the Oakland Water Company, and the
combination controlled the situation. Al
vinza Hayward, B. J. Rose and William
J. Dingee eecurea possession of the bulk
cf the Btock, and naturally the ownership
of the valuable property fell into their
b&nds. Hayward, as a matter of course
Is the financial head and supporter of the
combination. After the combination was
formed It was seen that the books of the
concern might make interesting and ex
tremely dansrerous reading If by any
chance they fell into the hands of Inquisi
tive people. While the records were val
uable, they were not worth enough to
keep, and it Is said that one day a pil-

was evidently - a *bellever In endowment
insurance, as he took out J400.000 worth in
various companies. His policy for $100,000
in the Equitable at its maturity was
worth $150,847, which, as before said. Is the
largest payment ever made to a living pol
icy holder, and makes a strong argument
in favor of tho form of insurance which
makes provision for old age as well as
giving protection !to the family.
Beating the Record.
Captain Merrill Miller, commandant of
the Mare Island. Navy Yard, accompanied
by a party composed of naval officers ana
their f f\mllles> came down from the island
veÂ«terday on the yard tug Lnadilla and
spent the day on Mour.t'Tamalpais. The
ride to the summit on the "crookedest
railroad in the world" was enjoyed by all,
and the lunch served on the mountain top
was afitting climax to a most enjoyable
day.
Naval Officers Have an Outing.
A portion, of North Beach bubbled with
excitement laat night. A determined man
behind a large revolver held the situation
at the corner of Powell and Filbert streets
and took his horse away from a howling
mob that wished to hold It for ransom.
A fire which partially destroyed a flsh
drying establishment on Chestnut street
occured about 8 o'clock in the evening. In
the building was a horse belonging to An
tono Trapioni, a fisherman. While the
fire was In progress two men rescued the
animal and led it to a safe place. When
Its owner appeared he was told that it
cost something to save horses" from the
"flames, and that if he wished to reclaim
hi3 animal he must pay a certain amount
of money. Trapioni had a large sum in
gold in his pocket but no silver, and he
was afraid to display the yellow metal In
front of the mob. He tried to argue with
the rescuers of the horse and get them to
release it on condition that he would pay
them the next day. This they refused to
do and started to lead the Quadruped
HW3V
Trapioni fought with the men as they
passed along Powell street, but they
would not relent and most of the mob
that followed seemed to take their side of
the argument. Finally the owner, of the
horse slipped into a relative's house and
secured a large revolver. He came out
and charged on the crowd. In an instant
the mob scattered, but the men who had
saved the horse's life â¢ stayed with their
prize. "When the pistol was poked under
their noses they concluded to accept ths
owner's demand. Several times the crowd
attempted to retake the horse and each
time Trapioni charged on it with the plstoL
Dr. T. W. B. Leland. autopsy surgeon at
the Morgue, arrived at this Juncture ani
after a little persuasion got possession of
the pistol and adjusted the difficulty.
The men who rescued the horsa escaped
and the police were unable to obtain their
names. . . * , .>': .-_

and - $1,500,000 ' In stock and $1,000,000 â¢ In
bonds of that concern entered into the
capitalization. _
When the deal was made the Contra
Costa Water Company had issued $4,aOO. â¢
000 in stock and $2,000,000 in its own bonds,
which made an aggregate of $7,500,000.
Immediately after this $300,000 more in
stock was issued to pay oft floating debts,
including, it was said, advances made
by Messrs. Dingee, Whittler, Prescott
and Goodall. Over the expenditure of
this money, it will be remembered, a
great scandal was raised. Money was
used as water in the City Councils. Mem
bers of those honorable bodies were
chased through the streets by hooting,
angry mobs. One of the directors, Whit
tier, claimed interest on the money
which he claimed he had used, and, it
will be remembered, he obtained what he
demanded. ', A
While peand;ff has been the companion
of both the companies, all has not yet
been told of their affairs. It is an open
secret that the value of the Haj'ward
company, for which the Contra Costa
Water Company paid $2,500,000, is not more
than $1 ,000,00ft.- It would be interesting,
therefore, to see the books, which the
people of Oakland have, demanded and
which cannot be produced because they
have been destroyed. Experts are author
ity for the assertion that the property of
the. Contra Costa Water Company could
be reproduced for $2,500,000. This it is very
evident makes the value of the combined
properties $3,500,000. Instead of $?,000.000,
which the plaintiff corporation is claiming
before the duty-stricken Hart.
And even in this aggregate there is a
large item that represents an unnecessary
oxper.se for which the people of Oakland
should not be compelled., to pay. Owing
to' the existence of -two rival* companies
the city is double-piped, a condition which
Ss now not needed. This double piping rep
resents an item of $500,000, which in justice
should be deducted from the total. This
means that the legitimate capitalization
of the Contra Costa Water Company
should be $3,000.(00 instead of $S,000.000.
The people of Oakland know this and
they insist that an impartial court shall
determine whether or not a quasi-public
corporation shall grossly impose upon
them. And in their struggle every mu
nicipality in the State Is vitally Interested.
