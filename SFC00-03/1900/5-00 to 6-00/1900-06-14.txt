decisive victory scored by Generals Me

to have a more far-reaching effect than
any recent action in the Orange River
Colony. General Kitchener's operations
south must have been almost unequaled
by the records of all forced marches. His
.detachment from headquarters' was a
merely routine- procedure, as, the chief of

CHANGE OF FRONT OF
THE DOWAGER EMPRESS
"WASHINGTON, June 13.â Definite offi
cial Information was received here this
afternoon from the Foreign Office of one
of the most important Continental powers
stating that the Tsung li Yamen had noti
fied the Minister of that power at Peklne
that the Dowager Empress would not ob
ject to the presence of foreign troops in
China's territory. Vague unofficial rumors
to this effect had been current, but tho
information received here to-day was from
such a high official source as to leave no
doubt that the Empress Dowager, who
practically constitutes the Government of
China, had made known this determina
tion not to object to the presence of the
foreign troops. This change of front came
as a distinct surprise to the officials and
diplomats, as all â¢ reports . up to this
time had pictured the Empress Dowager
as intensely hostile to the foreigners and
as. the real power behind the Boxers' anti
foreign uprising. This supposed attitude
of the Empress gave much concern to the
authorities here and at other capitals, as
It was feared that it would eventuate in
an open declaration by the Government of
China against' the presence of foreign
troops. This would have raised a new
complication, placing the foreign forces
now advancing on- Peking in the attitude
of resisting the sovereign authority of
China over her own territory, instead of
assisting China in a suppression of dis
order.
The Empress Dowager's acquiescence in
the plans of the powers is felt to remove a
threatened complication and at the same
time to give evidence that the Empress
Dowager is no longer yielding to the anti
foreign clamor.
In official Russian quarters the rumors
that the Empress Dowager has sought a
refuge at the Russian legation in Peking
are discredited and are resented as a hit
of inspired intrigue designed to create the
Impression that Russian sympathtzes are
with the anti-foreign element. It is point
ed out that Russia's course has been
marked by the utmost reserve, for while
It would have been possible at any time
to land large forces In China the Rus
riaa force actually landed has been com
paratively Insignificant, mainly for tho
reason that Russia desires to be wholly
free from any imputation of ulterior de
sign.
It was stated In diplomatic quarters to
night that tho Belgian Secretary of the
legation at Peking who was attacked by
a mob on Monday was probably Philip
May. formerly with the Belgian legation
In Washington and quite prominent In
social and official circles here, as his post

Great Britain. It is apparent to

President McKinley does not

torches in their hands.

slaughtered without, taking

SUMMARY OF
BOXER SITUATION
NEW YOEK, June 13.
From out of the thun
der clouds, looming over the
Chinese horizon there conies
to-night fitful flashes, which
only serve to intensify the
blackness of the situation.
Peking appears to be com
pletely isolated. No message
from the capital has reached
London or America since those
which chronicled the murder
of the Chancellor of the Jap
anese legation, and which were
transmitted over lines that
run northwest from Peking,
and thence through the do
minions of the Czar.
So far as is known the for
eign detachments which left
Tientsin on Sunday morning
and which were at first timed
to reach Peking on Tuesday
night have not arrived yet,
and according to a Tientsin
dispatch the Chinese were
throwing up intrenchments to
bar their routes to the capital.
On the other hand, it was stat
ed in Washington, with what
appears to be needless mys
tery, that the representative
of a certain power had- been â¢
notified that tho - Dowager
Empress had ordered the
Teung Li Yamen to notify for
eign representatives that no
opposition would be made by
the Chinese authorities to the
entry of the relief force into
Peking.
Two thousand Russians,
cavalry, infantry and artil
lery, had been landed at Taku,
according to a Tientsin dis
patch, and St. Petersburg ad
vices of the present and recent
date were alarmist in charac
ter.
Various messages indica
tive of the prevailing appre
hension were received at the
State Department from Ameri
can Consuls in China, but
nothing to bear out the state
ment cabled from Shanghai
that Minister Conger has
asked for two thousand T/nited
States troops.

"No proposition on political
lines for the settlement of the
Chinese question has .been made
to the United States by any for

high administration official to
day. This has special interest in
view of the Shanghai rumors of
a definite decision of the powers.
"The purpose of the President to
pursue an independent policy,"
said this official, "is well known.
No proposal has yet been made
for the removal of the Empress
Dowager, but well informed dip

will be imperative should she fail

their respective neighborhoods.
The diplomatic corps was
not without alarming dispatches.
Lord Pauncefote, the British
Embassador, was informed that
rioting in Peking had reached an
acute stage. Mr. Hay, secretary
of the Belgian legation, who -was
stationed in Washington several
years ago, and at one time en
gaged to the daughter of former
Secretary Belknap, was attacked
twice Monday and escaped only
after serious maltreatment by a
mob. Two officials of the British
legation serving as student in

same day. but cowed the mob

REPUBLICANS EN ROUTE
TO THE CONVENTION
Accompanied by Mr. Griscom Senator
Hanna left the city at 4 o'clock for Haver
ford, a suburb, where he spent the night
at Mr. Griscom's house. Although Mr.
Hanna has a suite of rooms at the Strath
ford Hotel It Is believed that he will-spend
all his nights at Haverford while the con
vention lasts.
.Conspicuous among the absent commll
teemen was ex-Senator M. S. Quay of
Pennsylvania, Mr. Quay's proxy Is held
by Senator Penrose. ' *
Outside of the national committee meet-
Ing Interest was centered on Senator
Hanna. It. was generally known that he
would arrive at 1 o'clock and there was
a goodly crowd at the station to see the
famous national chairman. Senator Hanna
was met at the station by Clement A.
Griscom, president of the International
Navigation Company, and they lunched
together In a restaurant on Broad street
while a crowd of admirers without doors
looked on.
The influx of visitors to-day was quite
large, considering that the date of the
meeting of the convention Is nearly a
week off. Almost every State and Ter
ritory is already represented here. Only
three or four of the national committee
men are absent and their places are being
filled by proxies from their respective
States.
The evening session of the committee
was devoted to the Delaware contest. The
committee continued its session until 12:05
when a decision was reached to refer the
Delaware controversy to a committee with
instructions to harmonize the differences
of the two parties if possible. The com
mittee consists of Payne of Wisconsin,
Cummings of Iowa. Saunders of Colorado
and Iceland of Kansas.
The Delaware Contest.
The resolution was the subject of much
discussion among the other contesting
delegations present, and District Attorney
Atwell of Dallas. Tex., sought out the
Associated Press to ask that a statement
be made in behalf of his State that the
question of Federal patronage had not en
tered into the contest there.
In presenting the resolution Mr. Payne
said that he introduced it because of the
evident pernicious activity of the office
holders \n the campaign, and that he be
lieved it would be a very serious mistake
for the committee to fail to ask that
official recognition be taken of this infrac
tion of the laws of the country. The com
mittee had, however, agreed to take a re
cess after the disposal of the Alabama
cases, and some of the members Insisted
that as it was then half past 7 o'clock
this decision should be adhered to. Ac
cordingly the committee dissolved for the
time, Mr. Payne requesting that action
be postponed until to-morrow.
Activity of Office Holders.
Immediately after this action ha<i been
tRken Committeeman Payne, who had
been acting as temporary chairman, in
troduced the following resolution:

contests for delegates.
In the State contest there were two fac
tions, one of which was known as the
Vaughan faction, represented by District
Attorney Vaughan and the other headed
by District Attorney Wickersham. The
technical grounds of the contest had.ref
erence to the regularity and Irregularity
of the two delegations. Mr. Vaughan is
now chairman of the State Central Com

HANNA TALKS ABOUT

At Ogden several reporters interviewed
the -delegates on the subject of Vice
President and if the delegation was go
ing to support Irving M. Scott. From the
answer of the 'delegates it may be In
ferred that California will not be a unit
for Scott. There is also talk of holding
an informal caucus after leaving Chicago,
It being expected that some other of the
delegates may join the party at Chi
cago. The caucus would be for the pur
pose of suggesting some names fox the
various committees. Â¦ - Â¦>â¢ - v--
The train reached Ogden on time and
after a short etop the delegates bade
adieu to the Southern Pacinc and started
along over the Union Pactnc. The after
noon was made cool and refreshing by a
gentle summer shower, which laid the
dust and tempered the atmosphere. The
ladies of the party. Mrs. Pardee. Mrs.
Cone and Mrs. Powers, form a happy lit
tle trio and chat along as only ladles

"I think no man who has made any
contribution to the campaign will say that
he has been subjected to the least coercion,
morally or otherwise. â¢ No one has been
asked to contribute any stated sum or any
portion of his salary, and if any such
statements have been made they were
made by persona who have not. so far,
visited these headquarters. The fact that
it was decided to open a convenient place
where contributions might be made by
employes was owing to the voluntary
Â¦practice of many to offer campaign con
tributions, either in the shape of money
or clerical or other work at the Republi
can headquarters. There was never any
system about it. and on this account the
members of the House decided to open
rooms at some central point for a few
days, where the employes might contrib
ute and cret a receipt for' their money.
These men are not under civil service
rules and are not assessed. A great many
of them have heretofore complained that
there was no recognized committee room
and no one authorized to receive contribu
tions. This year it Â¦was decided to give
the generously inclined no such excuse
and they were notified that they might
call at the Raleigh, whrre they were told
that anything they might feel inclined to
give would be thankfully received."
WASHINGTON. June 13.â The Post to
morrow will publish an article stating
that the Republican Congressional cam
paign committee- has been endeavoring to
collect as a campaign contribution a part
of the extra month's salary voted to the
employes of Congress just before adjourn
ment. The employes were Informed that
any contribution would be voluntary and
many of them paid no heed to the com
munication, while others made a small
contribution, so thatÂ«the amount collected
will not exceed $1200 or $1500. instead of
$10,000 or more, as has been expected. The
extra month's salary voted to employes
of Congress in accordance with a custom
'observed by both political parties when
In power amounted in the aggregate to
about 580,000. The Republican employes
were requested by note to call on Mr.
Schrader at the Raleigh Hotel. Mr. Schra
der was assistant secretary of the Con
gressional committee in the last cam
paign. When the employes called they
were asked for campaign contributions
and any inquiries as to the amounts, the
Post will say, were answered with tho
suggestion that half of their extra
month's pay would be acceptable, but
that contributions would be voluntary and
the giver could fix tne amount. The
amounts given ran all the way from $5
to $10, and in one instance, the Post will';
say, to a wholo month's salary.
Many employes, learning from others
the purpose of the note sent them, did
not call, so that tho total contribution
was much smaller than expected. Mr.
Schrader, when seen regarding the mat
ter, made the following statement:

Result of a Disastrous Accident on a
SEVEN PERSONS KILLED
IN A TRAIN WRECK
PHILADELPHIA, June 13.-With the
arrival of the advance guard and
the opening session of the National
Republican Committee to-day Phila
delphia has begun to assume a con
vention air. The committee had its first
formal meeting to-day at the Hotel Wal
ton and immediately began consideration
j of contests for membership of the conven.
tion. Practically the only contests of Im
portance are those from Delaware and
Tennessee, though developments this aft
ernoon have accentuated the Alabama
case. From Delaware Mr. Addicks is
again serkine: admission and the fight is
especially ijiteresting because of the bear
ing it may have upon the election of two
Senators next winter. The " friends of
Pension Commissioner Evans and Repre
sentative Brownlow of Tennessee are
fighting: for control of the Republican or
ganization of that State and both are on j
the ground. As is the case in the Ten- !
r.cfsre contest, the main point involved in
all of the other contests is the control of
the local organization.
The contests from Alabama consumed
the entire afternoon and resulted In a de
cision by the committee not to place the
names of any of the contesting delegates
of either faction on the temporary rolls
of the convention, except those from the
Ninth District. The action of the com
mittee was controlled largely by the fact
developed in the hearing that Federal of
fice holders have taken a very active part
on both sides of the controversy in shap
ing the result. This circumstance was. In
deed, so persistently brought out that
Acting Chairman Payne Introduced a res
olution- late in the session calling upon
the President to have their participation
investigated.
As to the Vice Presidency.
. Practically the only topic of conversa
tion-among the Republican leaders who
have arrived in Philadelphia is the ques
tion of the selection ot a candidate for
the Vice Presidency. Senator Hanna has
devoted almost the entire time since his
arrival to this question and has been in
frequent conference with other leaders on
the subject. He says absolutely that no
candidate has yet been selected either by
the President, by hJmself or by any one
for them. During the noon recess of the
committee Senator Hanna held a pro
longed conference with Senator Scott of
West Virginia, Hon. Joseph Manley and
Henry B. Payne, probably the three old
est members of the National Committee,
in point of service. When they dispersed
all agreed that the question of the Vice
Presidency was still open. There was a
general confession of concern over the
situation, but at the same time a feeling
that in the end the right man would be
found. . . â¢
"We want," said a member of this quar
tet, "a man for Vice President who would
be a big enough man for President in
case the necessity should arise for him
to become such. We don't care- where he
comes from. We will waive the geo
graphical question if we can get the right
man in other respects."
This statement expresses the general
sentiment among the members of the
committee.
Hanna Will Not Preside.
National Chairman Hanna will probably
not preside at any of the meetings of the
National Committee. He will be very
busy with other matters and Mr. Payne,
who occupied the chair at to-day's meet
ing, will continue to act as chairmaji.
A practical and thorough test was made
of the acoustic properties of the conven
tion hall this afternoon. Members of the
National Committee and the local organi
zations that have taken part in the prepa
ration of the building for convention pur
poses assembled and listened to test
speeches made by Mayor Ashbridge, Ser
geant-at-Arms Wiswell, Chairman Dob
bins of the building committee and others.
The band was in the place it will occupy
during the convention and men were sta
tioned in the remote sections of the hall
to listen to the 6peeches and music. All
reported that the acoustics were every
thing that could be desired.
The National Committee requests that
the different State delegations will act
promptly in designating the members. to
fill the following places:
Chairman of the delegation, secretary of
the delegation, vice president of the con
vention, member of committee on creden
tials, member of committee on permanent
organization, member of committee on
rules, member of committee on resolu
tions. National Committeeman," member of
the committee to notify the nominee for
President, member of the committee to
notify the nominee for Vice President.
Meeting of the Committee.
The Republican National Committee
met at the Hotel "Walton at noon to-day
and Immediately began the investigation
of contest cases preparatory to the forma
tion of the temporary roll for the National
Convention- Senator Hanna was not pres
ent when, the committee was convened,
and Henry C. Payne, member from
Wisconsin, was chosen to preside in "his
place. Senator Hanna came on from
Washington about half past 1. but did not
assume the duties of the chair during the
afternoon.
The entire afternoon session was de
voted to hearing the recital of testimony
and to arguments in the contest from the
State of Alabama. There yrere seven con
tests from that State, including: those over
the representation from the State at large
and those from the Second, Third, Fourth
Fifth, Seventh and Ninth districts.
The newspaper representatives, as well
as the public at large, were excluded from
the room In which the, committee sat â¢
The hearing in the main- consisted ' of
recitals of petty 'acts of bribery and of
Intimidation from both sides "of the con
troversies, and in some cases affidavits
were read in which the witnesses had tes
tified on both sides of the case, giving
absolutely contradictory testimony. The
principal developments of the day, how

IN FRIENDLY RIVALRY
Says Chicago Platform Should Be Re
affirmed. With Trust and Impe
rialism Clauses Added.
CHICAGO. June 13.â William Jennings
Bryan was in Chicago to-day and the
center of much political discussion, all of
it bearing on what may be done at the
Democratic National Convention next
month.
Mr. Uryan saw scores of people during
the day. H e talked "business" with Sen
ator Jones, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee; J. G. Johnson, head
of the executive committee; Charles A.
Walsh, secretary of the National Com
mittee, and Daniel J. Campau, national
committee-man from Michigan.
The platform to be adopted at Kansas
City and the Vice Presidential <juestirm.
especially the Towne Populist nomination
engle of It, were considered at some
lengrth. On the question of platform, the
trend of discussion forecasted to some ex
tent the difference? of opinion which may
arise at Kansas City, even among loyal
Bryan men. The question is whether the
money pla.nk and other leg-acies from 18IW
rhall be handled by reaffirmation of the
Chicago platform in a lump or whether
some planks from the 1K<6 platform, and
especially the money plank, shall be re
written. Mr. Bryan favors rewriting much
of the IS&ti platform this year. '
Senator Jones, according to credible ad
vices, advocates reaffirmation of thÂ«* Chi
cago platform as a whole and then a
quick transition to the newer issues of
Imperialism and trusts.
"I Bay as I have said before -so manv
times." Mr. Bryan replied, when asked
what he thought the platform and issues
this year should be, "that I think the
three bii? questions before us are monev,
trusts and Imperialism. The money ques
tion, of course, includes the question of
silver and of paper money. The question
of imperialism includes militarism and the
policy of which our national administra
tion's wr.rk in the Philippines and attitude'
on the Boer question are samples.
Â¦ "I hrlleve the principles adopted in the
platform of 1S36 were adopted at? a part
of the party creed, never to be departed
Trcnn. 1 don't think they should be or
ran be departed from this year. That
platform must, however, be added to as
new issues aris<Â». As I don't expect to be
a. delegate to the National Convention, I
cannot presume to discuss the form Jn
vhich these principles shall t-e stated in
the platform to be adopted there:
"I cannot undertake to say what will
be the paramount issue. No man can.
One thinks one question is the biggest and
Â«nÂ«-Â«ther man thinks another is."
The followlfjr statements by TV. J.
Bryan and Chairman Jones of the Demo
cratic National Committee will be pub
lished by the Tribune to-morrow:
1 "Money, imperialism and trusts will be
the three preat issues in the Democratic
platform. Money includes silver and pa
p*r. Imperialism carries with It militar
ism and thft Boer war. The contest in
Pouth Africa is one where Imperialism is
row Fpeclfically applied, and therefore It
concerns the people of this country. The
Chicago platform will be reaffirmed and
the new issues that have arisen added
to Its principles. I have not been asked
hy Senator Jones or anybody else to drop
16 to 1. - W. j. BRYAN."
"I believe that Colonel William J.
Bryan will carry every State he carried
in 1K*>. and moreover will carry Kentucky
and Maryland. He has a splendid chance
in Indiana. Ohio and New York. Tht>
rreat fight will be in New York and Ohio

ROCHESTER. N. Y., June 13.â "I stand
just where I did two months ago. I am

will not accept if nominated at Philadel

These words were spoken by Governor
Roosovelt to the Associated" Press re
porter upon his return to this city from
Caledonia at 5 o'clock this evening, where
he had been to make nn address In con
nection with the unveiling of a soldiers'
monument. The sentences were uttered
in such an emphatic manner as to leave
co room for doubt that the speaker
rr.ear.t just what he said. The Governor
continued:
, "J *"Â¦Â«â¢ that my name is being mentioned
In this connection again, but 1 cannot im
agine by whose authority or on whose
responsibility. The national leaders know
my position and the Now York State dele

The Governor added that he will go to
Philadelphia Saturday and make his posi
tion known to alt leaden. He does Ttiot
want the Vice Presidency, but frankly
confesses he would like to be renominated
for Governor. He and his friends believe
that the on!y bona-:5de opposition to his

bar and talked politics.
M. F. Tarpey is serene, but not over
confident. He said to-night: "I am not in
any combination. I have not consulted
with White. Maguire or Phelan in regard j
to my candidacy. I have not entered into
any compact. When the Fresno dele
gates indorsed me and pledged their sup
port to me for delegate at large I decided
to enter the contest. I fancied that I
would like to attend the National Demo
cratic Convention at Kansas City. I be
lieve that the convention about to assem
ble will elect me, but I will not go away
broken hearted and disappointed If I
â¢should not be chosen."
Indications to-night lead to the belief
that there will be no contests to vex the
convention. A compromise has been ef
fected in the Thirty-eighth Assembly Dls*
trlct of San Francisco. I^eo Kaufman,
leader of the faction that was excluded
at Native Sons' Hall, gets one-half the
delegation from the district and Charles
W. Fay. who made the fight for Phelan,
gets the other half. It is fresh in the
minds of the public that Kaufman and
his associates charged that Fay, acting
for one in a high place, used bribery and
corrupt means and actually prostituted
civil service to gain control of the dis
trict. So many ugly charges were made
in the contesting document filed with
Seth Mann, chairman of the State Central
Committee, that leading Democrats,
dreading a scandal, advised Fay to give
up half the delegation. It is the talk to
night that a compromise will be effected
in the Forty-fourth by the admission of
both delegations and the allowance of
half a vote to each delegate from that
district. It will be remembered that for
gery was charged^ in the Forty-fourth.
The delegates who were the victims of
the forgery offered to submit positive
proof of tho charges. Friends of Phelan,
not desiring to meet such accusations on
the floor of the convention, advised a
compromise.
It is settled beyond doubt that E. C.
Farnsworth of Tulare will be chosen
chairman of the convention. Gavin Mc-
Nab laid the wires six weeks ago for the
selection of Farnsworth. There were rea
sons other than Farnsworth's resemblance
to Bryan which suggested tho indorse-
Plenty of Flags, Shields and Bunting
to Inspire and Cheer the
Democratic Heart.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, June 13.â The Agricultural Pa
vilion, corner of Fifteenth and.M streets,
which last month resounded with the elo
quenco of Republican orators and loud
cheers for 'William McKinley, their stand
ard bearer, will re-echo to-morrow with
the cries of Democracy. Delegates from
all sections of the State will assemble in
the famous building and repeat the scenes
that attended the session of their rivals.
Delegates at large and district delegates
will be elected to represent California
Democrats In the National Convention of
the party called to meet in Kansas City
on July 4. j
The appearance of the pavilion has un
dergone a slight change in decorations.
On the sounding board immediately be
hind the chairman's desk is a striking
likeness of William J. Bryan. The. pic
ture surmounts the wings of a gilded
eagle and the decorator in hanging the
picture tried to symbolize the Democratic
standard bearer flying into office on the
wings of victory. On either side of the
picture is a trophy' of American flags.
Potted palms and streamers of red, white
and blue bunting heighten the effect.
The 9000 yards of white canvas and bunt
ing which has been used In walling in a
portion of the structure gives the pavilion
a cool and inviting appearance. The ugly
rafters of the building are hidden by a
stretch of canvas, which makes a fine
background for the colored streamers that
are stretched from the apex to all sides
of the pavilion. An immense Japanese
umbrella in the center of the temporary
roof adds to the effect. The canvas walls
are covered with shields, upon which are
painted the seal of every State in the
Union.
Arrangement of Seats.
The delegates will have very llttlo
trouble in finding their seats, as gaily
painted shields containing the name of
each county are strung around the hall.
The- delegates will be seated according to
districts, but the arrangement of the
seats haii been so cleverly perfected that
all counties will be within view of tha
chairman and the sound of his voice.
George Boyne. the well-known decorator
of Sacramento, is responsible for the strik
ing appearance of the convention hall and
TalbotH. Wall is for the arrangement of
the seats and other important features.
There is every probability that E. C.
Farnsworth of Tulare will be the tem
porary chairman of the convention. It is
a certainty that D. W. Carmichael. a
well-known real estate dealer of Sacra
mento, will be temporary secretary. He
will have as his chief assistant J. V.
ment of < the Tulare statesman. Farns
worth was a candidate for the nomination
of Justice of the Supreme Court in the
Democratic convention two years ago. His
friends then expected support from Phe
lan, which was never given. It was de
cided advisable therefore to select a chair
man with a memory- I* Phelan's friends
attempt the game of "wild hog" In this
convention the chairman may recognize a
protest against the proceeding.
George Patton came up from Los Ange
les with the notion that the delegates
were united here to have him preside over
the convention. He was assured of sup
port from various sections of the State.
Word was passed along tae line that ex-
Senator White preferred Patton to Farns
worth.
Gavin McNab listened to the rumors,
but never lost confidence In the success
of his Tulare County friend. To-night it
dawned upon the vision of Patton and
the patrons of Patton that Farnsworth,
backed by McNab, was invincible. There
fore a suggestion was made to the slated
chairman that Patton should be given
first place on the committee on resolu
tions. Then It transpired that Farns
worth, with the knowledge and consent
of MeXab, had agreed to confer the honor
attaching to the position of chairman of
the platform committee on that orna
mental Democratic warhorse, W. H. AI
ford, late of the San Joaquin Valley but
now of the metropolis, and of the metrop
olis favored as he holds a lucrative place
in the City Hall; it Is noted that Alfor.1
h'as claims other than those presented in
his handsome shape. He is reputed to be
the possessor of a very large degree of
the friendship and confidence of Colonel
William J. Bryan and consequently Is en
titled to recognition in making the plat
form-
Mr. Patton of Los Angeles is In no sense
discouraged. It Is true that his prospects
for chairman of the convention and leader
of the committee on resolutions have gone
glimmering, but he has saved his creden
tials and will be heard in the convention.
There will not be much of a platform,
anyway. The sentiment of the delegates
Is against committing the party in Cali
fornia to any fixed principles. Some reso
lution of a general character, the catchy
campaign platitudes, will be adopted. R.
F. del Valle, an able and accomplished
statesman from the orange groves, who
always comes to the rescue of a party in
distress, will jump in to-morrow and offer
the platform recently adopted by the Los
Angeles County Democratic Convention.

He arrived early on the scene to-day and

asking their support. The ex-Senator feel3
certain that he will win. A rumor float
ing around that he had withdrawn w,is
nailed by h!m as a canard. He said that
he "was in the fight to a finish and not

night Senator Ostrom said he based h:a
candidacy on geographical locality ; that
he did not set up any great claim for

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, June 13.â A marked feat
ure of the .situation here to-night
is the concessions which Phelan and
his supporters stand ready to make
in order to avert contests in the conven
tion. It is known that a hundred political
knives will be raised against Phelan by
outraged Democrats iÂ£ war Is declared,
hence the efforts to preserve the peace.
Already politicians are remarking that
Gavin McNab is shielding the Mayor
from the vengeance of Democrats. If
Phelan is permitted to represent his party
at the Kansas City convention he may
owe the recognition to the indulgence of
Gavin ilcNab and Jasper McDonald.
BIG AND LITTLE DEMOCRATS
PRESENT AT THE CAPITAL
Harmony Earnestly Desired, but
There Are Apprehensions of
Trouble.
PA.LL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. June 13.â The reunion of
Democrats to-night in the lobbies of
1 . the Golden Eagle and Capitol hotels,
' is regarded as significant by the
party leaders. Many of the big and little
guns of the Democracy are here, among
them Stephen M. White, Daniel Ostrom,
James D. Phelan. M. F. Tarpey, ex-Gov
ernor Budd, A. Caminettl. R. Porter Ashe.
Seth Mann, Gavin McXab,, I. D. Dock
weiler, Jasper M. McDonald. J. D. Max
well. Judge Conley, Dr. R. Beverly Cole.
Senators Braunhart and Sims, R. F. del
Valle. Thomas McCaffrey, W. II. Alfj)rd.
Charles Edelman, M. C. Hassett, Curtis
Hillyer, R. M. Fitzgerald, Martin C.
Marsh, W. G. Downing.
The talk on the surface* Is peace. Har
mony Is spoken of as something earnestly
desired, but beneath the surface there
are threats of revenge. Apprehensions
are felt that the combinations will be
broken by the candidacy of Daniel Os
trom of Yuba for delegate-at-large: He
was not admitted to the chosen circle of
the four favorites, but since his exclusion
he has displayed skill and energy in his
efforts to gain the favorable recognition
of his fellow Democrats. It Is obvious
that the success of Ostrom will mean the
defeat of the weakest member of the four.
Strenuous measures have been brought
forward to save Phelan from slaughter.
The Mayor, perceiving the danger that
threatened him, lined up at the Capitol
nia, there is even' likelihood that
the proprietor of the yellow sheet
will win the absurd notoriety
which he is seeking.
To-night the opposition to the
plan of the yellow journalists has
assumed a peculiar phase. Dem
ocrats who object to the prosti
tution of their party say that they
have not the slightest doubt that
Hearst will receive the indorse
ment of the convention. They
are quick to add, however, that
the indorsement as a matter of
course means nothing, as Hearst
has absolutely no chance of re
ceiving the coveted nomination.
In selecting William Jennings
Bryan as its Presidential nomi
nee, the national Democracy has
placed upon itself the necessity of
choosing an Eastern man as a
Vice Presidential candidate.
Whatever identity Hearst may
have in Democratic councils, it is
essentially of the West, his East
ern connections not being recog
nized by the national party.
Politicians of every caliber rec
ognize this fact, but they are will
ing to submit to the importuni
ties of Hearst's employes, not
withstanding the fact that their
acquiescence degrades their party
in the State and makes of their
convention a farce.
The single interesting feature
of this convention, therefore, will
be the indorsement of William
R. Hearst for an honor which he can
not win. His personality has quite
overshadowed every other issue of the
convention. There appears no doubt
(now that the four delegates at large to
the national convention will be Stephen
M. White, James G. Maguire, M. F.
Tarpey and James D. Phelan. D. *-\.
Ostrom has been making a stubborn
fight, but he must share the fate that
nearly every other northern man has
suffered at the hands of Democracy,
and he will be compelled to return home
with another defeat registered against
him.
Among the southern delegates there
is a very pronounced but unorganized
opposition to Mayor Phelan of San
Francisco. While this antagonism to
Phelan is widespread it is not effective
and will not accomplish the defeat of
the Mayor of the metropolis. _ In the
district delegations there are but few se
rious contests, as the honor of going to
Kansas City is not eagerly enough

CALL HEADQUAR
TERS, SACRAMENTO,
June 13. â The Demo
cratic State Convention which
will meet in this city to-morrow"
is destined from even- present in
dication to pass into the history
of the State as a political farce.
Delegates have come to Sacra
mento from every part of Cali
fornia, ostensibly to elect dele
gates to the national convention,
but in reality to pander to the ut
terly absurd and futile ambition
of William R. Hearst, the pro
prietor of the Pacific Coast rep
resentative of "yellow journal
ism." The Democratic conven
tion even before it has met has
degenerated into a clique of self
seeking flatterers who are striv
ing to inflame the imagination of
the Yellow Kid into a hope of an
ambition that will never be real
ized in order that his purse
strings may be loosened. Not
long ago the name of William R.
Hearst was suggested in a spirit
of coarse humor for the Vice
Presidential nomination on the
Democratic national ticket. The
joke passed through the East
and by a curious circumstance
became a matter of seriousness to
the employes of Hearst on this
coast. It is their intention, there
fore, to subordinate every other
object of this coming convention
to flicir plan of securing for
Hearst the indorsement of the
State convention as a Vice Presi
/-Vntini nominee.
Some of the nost prominent
Democrats in the State have been
made special coirmissioners of
the yellow sheet for the occasion.
An employe of the Examiner is
here to manipulate the scheme to
success. Delegations are being
importuned to subir.it to the
nonsense of Mr. Heirst's em
ployes. And while a stubborn re
sistance will be made b)i some of

ing, will lend weight to the part of a country sheriff in a new play written
especially for him, entitled "A Man From the West." With good judgment
the author has drawn the character of the country sheriff as a man of few
words and quick action. Jeffries is to make numerous arrests of all sorts of
tough lawbreakers. They will doubtless recognize at once the force of the man
who tells them to "Hold up your hands. You are my prisoner, and the Man from
the West has never been known to lose his man." The playwright has Intro

ST. LOUIS, June 13.â To all appearances
to-day witnessed the beginning of the end
of the riotous demonstrations and scenes
of bloodshed that have characterized the
.great street railway strike for over a
month past and in many quarters It is
thought that the strike itself will not last
much longer. These opinions are based
upon statements of the Chief of Police
and SherifT that the critical stage has
been passed and upon the fact that the
St. Louis Transit Company Is slowly but
surely approaching a complete resump
tion of business with the aid of non-union
men.
The Inquest over the bodies of the vic
tims of Sunday'B riot began to-day. The
testimony adduced was not of a character
calculated to base a decision as to which
side was to blame for beginning hostili
ties, the witnesses disagreeing on material
points. Some placed the blame on the
posse and other placed it on the strikers.
Many contradictions have arisen in the
accounts of Sunday's tragedy and these
were emphasized in the testimony taken
to-day.
The first witness was James P. Klatz.
a guest at the Llndell Hotel, who stated
that on Sunday he was Bitting In his room
overlooking Washington avenue and saw
an orderly body of uniformed street car
men marching west toward him. No
overt act was committed by them, but
two rocks had been thrown at the pass
ing car. When the head of the column
hael almost reached Sixth street witness
saw several men with guns step out and'
meet a number of strikers who had left
the ranks. There was some scuffling, one
of the men with a shotgun fired and a
man in uniform dropped. The streetcar
men fled at the first shot, according to
the witness, and firing became general
along tho block and from the windows of
the posse barracks.
C. \V. Cassilly, a photographer, salel
that he saw a man strike a car with
something soft; heard a cry of "Halt."
and saw several men pull one of the
streetcar men out of the parade and drag
him over to the other side of the street.

WOODLAND. June 13.â John B. Crow
ell, a laborer employed by George Grtffes
on the Troop farm, four miles west of
Woodland, died of heart failure some time
Tuesday night. He was found dead in
bed at 7 o'clock this morning by C; L.
Musgrove, and Dr. Prose said he had been
dead several hours.
Everything indicated that he made an
attempt to commit suicide by shooting
himself with a shotgun. He was found
lying on the bed with the muzzle of the
gun pointing over the right shoulder, the
butt resting near his ankle.
One barrel had been discharged. The
load passed directly over his head, and
lodged In the wall at. the head of his
bed. His aim had evidently been bad, as
there was no wound on the body, but the
discharge did its work effectively never
theless, as the shock evidently produced
heart failure. The other barrel was cock
ed, but the charge still remained In the
barrel.
The deceased was a native of England
and was about 55 years of age. He came
to Yolo County about twenty-five years
ago and has lived in various parts of the
county ever since.

J. H. Rosseter*s Imported gTeyhound,
the unbeaten For Freedom, will not be
a. contestant Sunday at Union Coursing
Park In the ladies' day champion
Etako. In a private trial last Sunday he
broke a toe on one of his fore feet, which
puts him effectually out of the running
for some time. The accident Is a grievous
disappointment to his owner and to all
enthusiasts in coursing. He Is conceded
to be the fastest greyhound ever Imported
from England and there was a general
desire to have him measure strides with
Beacon Luxor, Palo Alto. Royal Flush
and other distinctly Californian grey
hounds now reeogrnlzed as the fastest In
America. For Freedom has been particu
larly unfortunate this year. lie was
placed tn training for the John Grace

of its running he pulled out one of his

Colonel Cavender said that one of the
paraders fired a revolver, which was the
first shot he heard. Then, he said, the
crowd of paraders west of Sixth ran on
up Washington avenue and down Sixth.
The other portion of the parade, which
was still east of "Washington avenue, ad
vanced rapidly to the line of Sixth street,
and from which point opened fire with re
volvers, to which the posse replied.
Adjutant George H. Webster of the
posse paid one of the paradera pointed a
pun at him. but It failed to work. He
tried to pull the trigger a second timo.
when the witness heard the report of a
shotgun and saw the man fall.
The testimony brought out at the after
noon session differed very little from that
of the morning hearing, the witnesses
called on behalf of the strikers geperally
maintaining that the shooting was started
by the deputies without provocation, while
the deputies who were examined main
tained that no shots were flred by mem
bers of the posse until missiles had been
thrown and a shot fired by the men in the
street.
L. F. Morelock, a carriage maker, who
saw the affray, testified that the shooting
of the man RIne was without provocation.
Rlne, herald, was running away from the
rioters but stopped to look back and was
shot down by the deputies Just as ho
stopped.
Late in the afternoon the Inquest was
adjourned until to-morrow morning 1 . The

Deputy Sheriff Gardner McKnlght on the
testimony already In.
Colonel J. H. Cavender. who said he was
in command of. the posse comitatus. made
the positive statement that no member of
the bosse fired a shot before the paraders
flred. He said that a brick was hurled
through the window of a passing car. Two
deputies seized one of the strikers, who.
the witness said he was informed, was the
man who threw the brick.
a deputy with a shotgun dancing about
him in a stooping position, as if waiting
for a chance to shoot. The shots were
fired so fast that they sounded like the
falling of a row of bricks.

Â¦trom Mr. Tarpey went to Mayor Phelan
to-night and asked some plain questions.
He desired particularly to know how

fore queried: "How does the San Fran

cerned?"
Mayor Phelan responded: "I have not
delved Into the matter further than to
ascertain that . the San Francisco dele
gates favor White. Tarpey and myself.
How it stands as regards Magulre and
Ostrom I cannot say as I have not inter
ested myself.
some exciting sessions in the various Con.
gressional district conventions to-morrow.
In almost every district there are more
than two candidates and as each seeker
after the honor of representing his dis
trict in the national convention has his
own delegation behind him some interest-
Ing doings are assured.
First District.
J. S. Sweet. Mayor of Santa Rosa, ia
mentioned for delegate from the First
Congressional District. Ex-Senator Fos
ter of Tehama, J. Q. White of Mendo
cino and Lewis of Sierra are also men
tioned. At a late hour it was tacitly ad
mitted that Messrs. Sweet and White
would carry off the prizes.
Second District.
D. W. Carmlchael. the Sacramento bus
iness man and prominent Democrat, who
was selected to act as temporary secre
tary of the convention. Is a leading can
didate in the Second Congressional Dis
trict for the position of delegate to the
coming Democratic National Convention:
It is practically conceded that Mr. Car
michael will be chosen. That gentleman
is so Imbued with a trip to Kansas City
that he had made up his mind to go there
whether he was selected or not. Ex-Con
gressman A. Caminetti of Jackson, Ama
dor County, has been mentioned as a fit
member of the party to Journey to Kan
sas City and cast a vote ior Bryan. Mr.
Caminetti is too modest to make an open
fight for the hor.or. He Is willing to ac
cept It if it is handed to him. Attorney
E. W. S. Wood of Stockton is also men-
tloned as a candidate. At a late hour
it was definitely settled that the latter
would accompany Mr. Carmlchael to the
National Convention.
Third District- ;:'-'- : U-
Robert M. Fitzgerald of Oakland and
James A. Keys of Sulsun are almost cer
tain to be chosen delegates to the Na
tional Convention by the Third Corigres-
sional District delegates. D. H. Arnold,
chairman of the Colusa County delegation,
will make a bid for the honor, as will also
Mackey of Solano. .
Fourth District.
The only candidates in the Fourth Dis
trict Congressional Convention are Curtis
Hlllyer, a young and promising: lawyer
of San Francisco, and Charles Edelman,
at ono time a resident of Los Angele5, but
now a wheelhorsejn the San Francisco
Democracy. As these gentlemen will have
no opposition they will be elected by ac
clamation.
Fifth District
Jasper McDonald of San Francisco and
J. H. Henry of San Jose will in all prob-
aoility be the choice of the Fifth District
Congressional Convention. They are the
only candidate in the field and delegates
of the district favor their election.
Senator R. F. del Valle of Los Angeles
and John McGonlglo of Ventura will un
doubtedly be chosen delegates by the
Sixth Congressional District Convention.
Sixth District.
ICo opposition has been offered the gentle
men named ar.d none Is expected.
Seventh District.
There will be a very interesting strug
gle In the Seventh Congressional District
in electing delegates to the National Con
vention. There are half "a dozen candi
dates in the field and each candidate Is
confident, that he has the backing of his
delegation and bases his hope of victory
on this fact. The election of William Mc-
Fadden. chairman of the county com
mittee of Orange, is looked upon as a cer
tainty. Mr. McFadden, it is said, has been
in the. field for some months and has ad
vanced his interests so far that It Is al
most Impossible for him to lose. E. II.
Tucker of Fresno has many friends in the
district and has hopes that, their united
stand for him will result in his selection.
Among the other candidates are George
M. Cooley and T. J. Dofflemeyer of
San Bernardino. ' Dr. J. B. . Renshaw
of Daggett, San Bernardino County;
P. J. Tallant of Kings County, H. E. Mills
and Henry A. Jastro of Bakersfleld. The
latter's fight is being handled by Attorney
Louis Fulkerth. Jastro claims to have
the entire Kern County delegation behind
his fight. He is ambitious to represent
his district in. the National Convention.
Four years ago he was defeated by one
vote for the honor by Church of Fresno.
Alternates at Large.
Sydney Van Wyck, an attorney of San
Francisco; Hugo Hornlein, proprietor of
the Cafe Royal, and Dr. Charles A. Clin
ton of San Francisco are candidates for
the positions of alternates at large to the
convention which meets In Kansas City
on July 4.

Where District Conventions Will

Carry State.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, " . SACRA
MEN'TO, June 13.â The following advice
and -views expressed by Seth Mann, chair
man of the Democratic State Central
Committee, will be of interest to* dele
gates: "The Sacramento committee of
arrangements, which has had In hand the
preparations for the reception of the
Democratic State Convention, is entitled
to a great deal of credit for the thorough
and careful manner in which it" has per
formed its duties. The pavilion has b-Â»-n
prepared in such a manner as to enable
speakers to be heard throughout the hall;
the seating of the delegations . has been
very Intelligently arranged.. Places of
meeting for the Congressional conven
tions have also been get aside In various
parts of the big building. Members ! of
the First and Second Congressional dis
tricts will hold sway to the 'left of the
speaker's platform: the delegates of the
Third District will meet in the anteroom
which adjoins the entrance to the pavilion,
and the Fourth,; Fifth and, Seventh dis
tricts have been given separate places im-
mediately behind the platform, while the
Sixth will be directed to hold Its sessions
in the main hall after an adjournment of
the convention.
"The credential and resolution commit
tees may meet either in the pavilion,
where rooms have been reserved for
them, or at the Golden Eagle Hotel, as
the committees may respectively decide.
It ha3 been provided "and placards have
been posted announcing that delegates,
upon arrival in Sacramento, shall imme
diately ' present their credentials to the
secretary of the State Committee at its
headquarters in the parlor of the Golden
Eagle Hotel, and persons holding proxies
are requested to pursue the same course.
"The chairman of each delegation will
be furnished with badges for his delega
tion by the secretary of the State Com
mittee. These badges will entitle the
wearers to admission to the delegates'
portion of the pavilion. The respective
delegations, If they have not done so,
should convene at once and select a chair
man.
"The convention will assemble at 10 a.
m. on Thursday, June 14, at the Agricul
tural Pavilion, corner of Fifteenth and M
streets. It will be my pleasant duty to
call the convention to order and the con
vention, no doubt, will proceed with Its
temporary organization, which will con
sist of the selection of a temporary chair
man and secretary and the appointment
of a committee on credentials.
To Instruct for Bryan.
"It is expected that there will be a
fairly large attendance at the conven
tion. Reports received thus far lead me
to believe that there will 500 or 600 dele
gates present. . There seems to be no
doubt that the convention, will Instruct
Us delegates to vote ' ' for William J.
Bryan as the candidate of the Demo
cratic party for the Presidency of the
United States, thus aligning itself with
the column of States thus far heard from
who have Quite generally adopted this
resolution "of Instruction. The delegates
are all enthusiastic and confident. There
is a strong sentiment generally present
favoring a' thorough system of organiza
tion in all of the precincts of the State,
and I believe that with , an Â« enthusiastic '
movement in the party toward an organ
ization along, these lines that the State
may be carried for the Democratic party
at the coming election.

DEMOCRATS PLAN TO INDORSE HEARST FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
have lost no time In organizing them
selves into a bureau. By common con
sent ex-Governor Budd has been chosen
chief of the bureau and literary censor.
When the bureau was organized a seri
cus diSiculty presented Itself. As the
people of the State know, his Honor the
Mayor has the Interesting faculty of
saying nothing and saying it well. Ex-
Judge Maguire has on more than one oc
casion distinguished himself by saying
something at the wrong time. How to
reconcile these peculiarities and to bring
from them something said at the right
time was the problem presented to Cen
sor Budd. He was therefore unmovable
In the jtesition he adopted.
With delicate courtesy he admitted the
literary 4b lllt y of ex- Judge Magulre.; The
people of California may have forgotten
the fact that Magulre has won his spurs
in the field of literature, but the experi
ence will never be forgotten by Magulre.
And the circle of protection has been
drawn alro around his Honor the Mayor.
The people of. San Francisco are still
tingling over the Mayor's recent literary
triumph. He has dipped into the pool of
literary competition and the Phelan flag
flaps to the people of San Francisco the
serious fact of his victory. He is spurred
to further emulation and to-night the
censor has labored In earnest consulta
tion with him. It Is understood that he
has givefc his promise that under no con
sideration will he accept a prize from the
Yellow Kid and if he does not the citizens
of the metropolis may be reasonably sure
that no new official atrocity will be per
petrated. 'V " w
- Mayor Phelan needs no prize for his
labors for the Yellow Kid. His Honor ha3
shared the sorrows and the sadness ot
his saffron master. He has felt with the
little Incorrigible the stings of defeat and
It is no more than common justice thai
without price or compensation he should
help, with his pen, to punish the common
enemies whom he and the Kid enjoy. So
his Honor will write for glory and tell the
friends of the Kid what the Democratic
convention was not.
And his Honor feels already the se
riousness of his responsibility. He stood
to-night in the lobby of the Golden Eagle
Hotel burled In profound thought. He
seemed not to hear the personal things
which the southern delegates were saving
of him. He seemed unconscious to tne
murmur of antagonism that needs only an
organizer to make his Honor write a
most peculiar story of the convention. He
was burled In the thought heap which he
will deliver to the Yellow Kid.
And while the Kid is waiting for the
glittering thoughts of his commissioners
extraordinary another difficulty has pre
sented Itself. His Honor the Mayor
wants to talk to the convention. So does
ex-Governor Budd. and Magulre would
rather be politically dead than dumb. All
want to talk and all are firmly convinced
that it would be political suicide to permit
any members of the bureau to report
what the others have said.
The difficulty Is a serious one and It
has been suggested that a Scotch verdict
would be better than none and that Gavin
McXab, friend and councilor of the bu
reau, should be deputised to report every
thing which has a personal meaning to
the Kid's commissioners.
Whatever the decision may be the fact
remains the .commissioners of the Tellow
Kid constitute to-night the center of at
traction. They have overshadowed the
Issues of the convention, have absorbed
the Interest of the delegates and have in
tneir hands the power to pose in plati
tudes before their envious friends.
SCHEME TO DEPRIVE
SYLVA OF HIS SEAT
Fight "Will Be Made On His Indict
ment for Perjury by the Grand
Jury.
, CALL. -HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. June- 13.â There Is a scheme un
der way. to deprive Adolph Sylva of Sau-
Â«=a.::o or his ri^ht to participate in the
convention which convenes to-morrow. A
number of "holier than thou" Democrat.-*
of San Francisco have raised their hands
in horror at the idea of allowing Sylva to
seat him?elf arnor.g representative Demo
crats. They point to the fact that Mr.
Sylva was Indicted far perjury by the
Grand Jury of the city ar.d county of San
Francisco and ia therefore "unclean."
The scheme, as it developed late to
night, is to have the chairman appoint
a member of the Marin County delegation
on the committee on credentials and ths
member so appointed will be called upon
by the good Democrats of San Francisco
to throw Sylva down. The plan may suc
ceed. a3 there are a number of prominent
politicians in the scheme.
Sylva has not as yet appeared on the
scene, but it is mere than probable that
when he learns of the attempt to do him
Injury he will search out the perpetrators
and wreak summary venjreance. Sylva
was elected to represent hi3 town at the
local convention and will therefore insist
that he has a legal right to participate in
the business of that august bcly.

STATE EXECUTIVE'S FINDINGS.
SAN" FRANCISCO, June 13, 19OO.
His Excellency John Hay, Secretary of State, Washington, D. C. 2
SlH: In reply to your tcU-irrnm of date. 3Iay 31, I have the honor to reports *j
- FIRST That no cane In San Francisco or California has been dlnpnoseil an bubonic plague g
by any attending physician while the victim was alive, nor by the attending: physician after death, q
In some of the suspected cases death has occurred when no regular physician wos In attendance, f
There have been in nil only eleven suspected cases among: a population of 33,000 Chinese (15,000 of 'A
nhom are qunrniitinod). and no cases amoiiK wliitcn and other races. The examinations made after Â»,
death of the bodies of the suspected cases since the alleged discovery of the disease more than three C
months oro fail to furnish satisfactory proof of plague. " ""1
SECOND That the quarantined district contains upward of 15,000 Chinese subjects, â¢â¢ 33 OO of Â§
whom are anable to nupport themselves IÂ»> virtue of the quarantine. Â£
THIRDâ That full and fair investigation has been denied the physicians of the Chinese by the 4
city Doard of Health. V
FOURTH â That the Chinese were forced to appeal to the courts, and then -were accorded the "Â£
right of Investigation into the canne of death of the dead sunpects. .*,
FIFTHâ That since the procurement of the order of'court, granting privilege to the white puy- C
siclans of the quarantined Chinese to visit the sick and be present and take part in autopsies had, 4/
neither the cit>- Board of Health nor Federal oillcers have been able to discover any bubonic plague *Â£
case, dead or alive. / jjj
MXTH â That there has been no epidemic in Chinatown. *r
SEVENTH â That the municipal records show the proportion of deaths in Chinatown has been 0
no greater than that of any other portion of San Francisco since the date of the discovery of the ol- g
lrged plague In Chinatown. ' "\ '.!; 4
EIGHTH â That I cannot find proof the plague alleged to be here is either Infectious or con- q
tagious. I lind no proof that any person has contracted It from another) and I further llnd that *r
certain individuals who have been repeatedly exposed at autopsies and elsewhere to the alleged (f
plague, and others who have moved about in the houses and rooms where the inspects expired, liav- 2
ing done so without taking any precaution whatever against the supposed maludy, have neither .Â»
contracted the same nor spread the disease elsewhere. C
XIXTH â That no two persons of the same family have contracted the disease, and that no two *â¢
cases have occurred within the same house or building, no matter how great the exposure may have V
been. 0
TENTH â That the medical gentlemen and experts of the city Board of Health and the Federal 4
quarantine officers who have ventured the Injurious opinions which have spread broadcast over C
the world the rumor of the existence of the dreadful plague in the great and healthful city of San S
Francisco have never seen a living case of plague; whereas, some among the physicians, surgeons â¢Â£
and scientists with whom I have advised have had personal experience and wide opportunities in <J
observing- the bubonic plague when it was raging in India and elsewhere, and they all pronounce the *Â£
suspected cases here not bubonic plague. A
ELEVENTH â From the best light I have been able to procure, nnd from a most careful con- g
Â¦ideratlon of the whole subject, I am'plcaied to Inform your Excellency that I firmly believe no case \
of bubonic plague has at any time existed within the borders of our State. ~
TWELFTH â That if the cases referred to were genuine plague, even then the Quarantine, a* 3
conducted by the city Doard of Health, in conjunction with the Federal quarantine officer, is dls- 4
criminating- against the Chinese nnd also unreasonable according to information derived from the C
highest authority here obtainable. !t
THIRTEENTH â It Is nndetermlned by the court whether the injunction referred to has been *J
violated. c
FOl'RTEEXTU â Since the report to your Excellency Involves, among other things, the question. 4
whether there is plague in Chinatown, and also vitally touches the commercial and other interests C
of San Francisco, as well as deeply concerns the welfare of the entire State, I have deemed It my A
duty to call into consultation distinguished physicians, surgeons and bacteriologists, able llnanciers jt
and business men and others, as well as my eminent predecessor in office, the Hon. James H. Budd, Â£
some of whose names are, therefore, in concurrence hereto attached. 4
HE.VRY T. GAGE. <â¢

We concur In the foregoing conclusion that bubonic plagne does not exist and has not existed 4

THE bubonic plague fake received a
knockout L!otr lost night when Gov
ernor Gage. In reply to the official
note of inquiry received from Secre
tary of State Hay on May 31, telegraphed
to Washington that he has made a thor
ough Investigation of all reports concem
ir.e plague cases in this city and has ar
rived a.t the conclusion that the bubonic
plague does not now exist ar.d never has
existed in this city. The Governor's re
port Is indorsed by four physicians of un
questioned standing in the "medical world
and by nine leading business men. all of
whom assisted him in his exhaustive In
vestigations, acting, at his request, as a
sort of ad\-isory cotamlttee.
When Governor Ga^e received Secre
tary Hay's rote of inquiry he came at
ence to this city to inform himself thor
oughly on the situation. He found that
the State Board of Health had accepted
the reports of the local board as true and
Â¦was about to officially notify the world
that they pave full credence to the re
j>orts. ignoring the State's executive in
Thr- matter altogether.
The Governor put a step to the whole
bncSaeMi and toM the members of the
board very plainly that unless they could
show him from their own official investi
gations that the plague did exist here he
â¢wcuM not countenance the expenditure of
State funds.
The Governor then called to his aid the
men who have signed his official report
and commenced a most thorough and
pair:stiik:::sr inv<?st!??at!cn, that has re
<;-:r'.G two weeks of hard work. His con
clusions are stt forth ia terms that can
:. : be mistaken and the effect of his re
port Trill be to convince the world that
Saa Francisco is free from the plague, as
it has always been.
The hearing of the injunction sued out
in the United States Circuit Court by"
svme of the quarantined Chinese against
the ?an FrJir.cisco Beard of Health to
lift the fake quarantine progressed far
enough ytsterday to convince all who lis
tÂ«T,*-d to the proceedings that the court
â¢will hardly fail to grant the injunction.
Tr.:- board's attorney. J. J. Dunne, was
forced to admit in open court that dis
<_r:rr.:na.tion had been shown against Chi-
Dcae in the quarantine district, which is
one of the principal points upon which
the injunction suit is based. Attorney
James G. ilag"uire presented the case of
the Chinese in an ab-e argument that was
not concluded before the hour cf adjourn
ment arrived. A decision is confidently
expected to-day.
De Haven Sits With Morrow.
The -whole of yesterday was consumed
In the United States Circuit Court in the
presentation cf the Quarantine case and
the discussions cf the Issues involved.
United States District Judge de Haven
occupied the bench with Circuit Judge
Morrow for the purpose of consultation
tr.d decision.
There was a great array of attorneys,
J. C. Campbell. James G. Maguire. Sam-
TJâ¬l M. Shcrtrlcre. John E. Eennett. Rob- !
ert Ferrai and Thomas Keough appear
ing for the Chinese and Joseph Dunne for
the City Board of Health. There were al
po present as spectators Thomas D. Rior
can and Lyrnan I. llowry. attorneys
rened in treaty and constitutional law;
Chinese Consul Ho Yow and Wong Wai,
s-cretary of the Six Companies: two score
Â« '"-.riEtian missionaries, mostly women. ;
Â£".d Bbout one hundred Chinese. Among |
â¢ e talent at the reporters' table was
S";r Poon Chew, editorial manager of the
C-i-ese daily piper. Chung Sai Yat Po.
The minutes cf the Board of Health
Â¦with reference to the refusal of the board
to admit to the quarantined district Dr.
Pil'.sbury and other physicians engaged by
the Chinese were brought into court. Mr.
Bes&ett requested the court to make an
order admitting the excluded physicians
to be present at autopsies. Judge Mor
row replied that whenever such a case of
refnsal should arise he would make such
Â£.n order.
Discrimination Is Denied.
Mr Du^ne then took Mp the return of

could have said that those casea had oc
curred within the limits of the city and
county of San Francisco or within the
limits of the State of California, and
would have had equal right to quaran
tine the whole city or the State. Some
thing more than the belief of the health
authorities, sometimes more specific as to
locality and other facts, should be set
forth before this tremendous power is
conferred.
Authorities Are Bead.
! Authorities were read to show that the
fact must be established that the quar
antined person had been infected with the
disease. or exposed to Infection. ,If the
board bad isolated the houses In which
the, deaths had Occurred and had placed
the residents of those houses under quar
antine it would have acted strictly within
its powers and the exercise of reasonable
discretion. On the contrary, the measures
adopted were unreasonable; no provision
was made to protect the health or lives
of the Asiatics in the district and they
were prevented from leaving the crowded
and unsanitary environment of that -part
of the city, so that if there should be a
plague it might sweep down hundreds and
thousands of the residents of the Chinese
quarter, j
No community had a right, argued the
counsel, to shut up thousands of people
In an unhealthy and Infected district.
The Chinese here were entitled to thÂ»
equal protection of the laws and they
should not be compelled to remain in an
infected quarter to mingle with infected
persons. â
Here an adjournment was taken until
10 o'clock this morning.
Chinese May Make Trouble.
The Chinese are "resting on their arms.'
to use the expression of a Board of Health
employe who spent yesterday in the quar
antined district. They are awaiting. Im
patiently but quietly, the decision of the
United States Circuit Court before they
take any further action. If It goes against
them It is predicted by the men who are
in Chinatown every day that serious
trouble will follow. The Chinese are all
armed, and if they ever commence rioting
In earnest bloodshed will surely result.
They are only restrained now because
they have great confidence in the abllity
of their attorneys to break down the
quarantine lines. All depends on the out
come of the case now in court.
The quarantine is becoming daily more
lax and the stream of people who come
and go through the lines on permits from
the Board of Health has Increased until
It has become almost continuous. Even
the people who possess permits make
light of the whole situation.
"Do vou suppose." said an elderly man
yesterdav. as he slipped under the ropes.
"that I v/ould go into Chinatown every
day and remain there all day long. return-
Ing at night to ray family in Alameda, If
I thought for a minute that there was the
slightest danger? Why. there are plenty
Just like me who would not go there If
there was any plague."
The citizens' relief committee held a
meeting at the Board of Trade rooms yes
terday afternoon and decided to expend
$3000 "more if necessary to continue the
cleansing- of Chinatown and In providing
food for the Indigent Chinese who are
unable, because of the quarantine, to get
outside and make a living. The commit
tee is now paying out between $500 and
$600 per day and Is making provision to
continue the work for another ten or
twelve days, although a strong feeling
pervaded the committee room yesterday
that the decision of the Federal court
will relieve them from the burden very
speedily.
Cars "Will Run To-Day.
Employes of the Sacramento and Wash
ington street lines of the Market Street
Railway Company received notice from
the headquarters of the company last
night to be on hand and ready to operate
cars a? usual to-day. This Is taken as an
indication that word has been passed
along the line from some official source
that the quarantine wlli be lifted to-day,
sufficiently, at least, to enable the trans
portation lines running: through the
fenced-ln district to resume operations.
' The Sacramento and Jackson street
lines have been shut <5own ever since the
quarantine has been on. and there has
been a lot of suffering among employes of
the company in consequence. Mo notice
has yet been given as to when traffic will
be resumed, but the order given to the
men last night seems to be an indication
that cars will be moving to-day.

the court had no Jurisdiction; that the
matter was without equity, and that for
the evils and injuries wnlch the petition
er Jew Ho Is alleged to have suffered
there is adequate remedy In an action at
law. The counsel read from the city
charter to set up the powers of the City
Board of Health and argued that the
board had not gone beyond those powers.
Discrimination against persons or races
was denied, and the past existence of the
bubonic plague in the Chinese quarter
was affirmed. He contended further that
the germs of that disease linger and live
for a long time after escaping from the
animal body, and that the present system
of quarantine was a necessity.
Mr. Maguire began his argument on be
half of the petitioner t>y denouncing the
action of the board as an attempt to ex
ercise the most extraordinary power ever
known under a free government. It sus
pended al! political rights, and where such
tremendous arbitrary power Is sought to
be exercised a very complete showing of
that power ought to be made. He fur
ther contended that the Board of Health
Is not enforcing the ordinance of the
Board of Supervisors throughout all the
area of the quarantined district as de
fined in the ordinance. He averred that
The houses on the north side of California
street the west side of Kearny street,
the Eouthwest line of Montgomery ave
nue, between Kearny and Broadway and
some houses on the east line of Stockton
Â«=treet between California and Broadway.
had been by the board exempted from
quarantine solely because they were in
habited by white people. If that district
is quarantined It must be because it is
necessary to be quarantined to prevent
a great danger to the people of this city.
The board, he argued, was discriminating
against the Chinese exclusively, and there
was no reason, either In law or medicine,
why these houses occupied by white peo
ple should have been exempted from the
rigors of the quarantine.
Denies Existence of Epidemic.
The speaker next adverted to the fact
that the nine houses in which It was al
leged that persons died of the plague had
not been Isolated and quarantined. No
showing had been made, he argued, tha't
the bubonic plague was either contagious
or epidemic. The court could not* be ex
pected to look beyond the pleadings Into
books of medicine or history, and he as
serted that the authorities showed that
under certain conditions the bubonic
plague was simply sporadic and not epi
demic, and that that was the case In San
Francisco.
The long string of denials In the an
swer were next taken up by the speaker,
and when he asked why the board had
denied having restrained and imprisoned
the petitioner within the boundaries of
the quarantined district, Mr. Dunne re
plied that although he admitted the phy
sical fact of the detention of . the peti
tioner, such was not confinement or im-
prisonment or the deprivation of any
I right under the police powers of the
Mr. Maguire retorted by saying that
Mr. Dunnes philosophy was exceedingly
subtle, a legal fiction and an evasion of
the obligation to respect the rights of the
individual.
The fact that the Board of Health did
not quarantine within the district was a
virtual admission on the part of the board
that it was acting without reason. If
it believed that there was bubonic
plague within the district It committed
a great wrong upon the ten or twenty
thousand Chinese in the district by al- !
lowing, persons who had been in infected
buildings to mingle with the population.
Board's Powers Questioned.
Mr. Maguire contended that Instead of
legislating upon the plague question- the
Supervisors had delegated Its powers to
the Board of Health, and that such dele
gation of power was not legal or per
missible, and was therefore null and void.
The speaker argued that the ordinance of
the Supervisors adopted on June 2 had
not been legally adopted and was there
fore void.
The court had not been advised In the
answer as to the exact locality in which
the cases of alleged bubonic plague had
been found beyond the statement that
they had been encountered within the dis
trict- quarantined. With equal truth, pro
ceeded Mr. Magulre, the Board of Health

at table the bride and groom slipped away
to don street garments in place of the
wedding finery, preparatory to stealing
away from the home.
The groom sought the buyer's room.
He wore full regimentals, the suit hav
ing been made for the occasion, and after
disrobing and donning citizen's attire he
concluded that his brilliant uniform would
be safer in the butler's room till he re
quired it again than elsewhere. In this
he was mistaken.
Callaghan after performing his trying
duties as butler, made more so by the
wine he had imbibed, went to his bed
room. His eyes felt upon the regimental
suit of the groom and his old military
spirit burned within him. Just for the
sake of old times he dressed himself in
the suit and was so pleased with the ef
fect that he decided to play the soldier
on'ce again and have a rollicking time.
He went downtown and made a night of
it In all the glory of gold and tinsel.
Early in the morning the butler took
a California-street car to return to the
Voorhies home. The conductor and grip
man were amazed at his appearance and
wondered that an officer should so far de
grade himself. Callaghan was in truth
very drunk. The epaulettes had been cut
from the shoulders of the coat and every
brass button had been snipped off. HÂ»
got off the car in front of the house and
staggered In.
About 9 o'clock, as he did not appear
at breakfast, the bride's brother made
an Investigation and discovered him
asleep in bed. He had discarded the coat,
but that was all. He was roused from his
slumbers and made to take off the trou
sers. He raised such a row that Police
man Coughran was called In and Cal
laghan was placed under arrest for mali
cious mischief and disturbing the peace.
He was unable to obtain ball and re
mained in prison.
Callaghan denied that he had worn the
suit and hinted that some one out of
spite had thrown an old suit into hla bed
room and had jut up a job on him. â¢ When
told that the gripman and conductor had
seen him he was not so positive, but de
clined to say where he had been. It Is
supposed that he had either given tho
buttons and epaulettes to some women in
the "tenderloin" or some young men
about town had taken advantage of his
drunken condition to spoil his uniform.
He had not entirely recovered from his
"jag" when seen in the City Prison yes
terday afternoon.
JOHN CALLAGHAN, who for the
past month has officiated with be
coming dignity as butler in the
home of Dr. A. H. Voorhles. 2111
California street, has fallen from grace.
Callaghan is an Englishman 27 years of
age, and before coming to this country
had served some years in the Eleventh
Hussars, a crack British cavalry regi
ment. His military training did not de
tract from his value as a butler until an
unkind fate placed In his waS r a tempta
tion that was irresistible.
On Tuesday night the Voorhles resi
dence was ablaze with light and sounds
of gayety Issued from windows and doors.
The occasion was the wedding of Leila,
the daughter of the house, to Lieutenant
Guy Scott of the artillery. It was a.grand
function and Callaghan, the English but
ler, was in his glory. : v ;:
While the wedding supper was being
served Butler Callaghan took occasion to
freely sample the champagne and other
liquors and as a result became somewhat
exhilarated. While the guests were still

ENGLISH BUTLER OF VOORHIES
FAMILY FALLS FROM GRACE
OUR schools have been like a patient
sick unto death with chronic Indi
gestion, caused not by lack of food
but by a surfeit of good things ta
ken In Buch immoderate quantities!
For a long time we have been overfeeding.
We have had doctors and doctors and
nurses and nurses, and doctors have di
rected and good nurses have tried in vain
to follow the wise (?) instructions.
As far. back as In the early '90's we
learned that a certain regime prevailed in
Boston, and "if In Boston why not here?"
And bo from the little 4x5-inch manual
one could carry In the pocket and not
know It was there the instructions grew
and grew until the volume became an
armful. No doubt the volume Was a most
valuable book of reference. The trouble
was not with the nature of the matter
therein contained, but with its quantity â
like too much at a meal and the meals too
far between. With the course as now
outlined, permanently changed from a
yearly one to that of six months, much
good will comeâ the street Arabs will be
fewer, for the easily discouraged shirk
will not need to go back a whole yearto
catch up, and so will try once more. The
long waits practiced up to date have made
It a. case of sailing between Scylla and
Charybdis. It is so hard to decide
whether to let a child drag along and
gather what he may, and later retrace,
or to turn him back as soon as he has
given proof of final failure.
At the end of the first quarter the capa
ble teacher knows who will not make the
next grade at the close of the year, but
such is tho inconsistency of youth that a
child will pass month after month doing
bad work and will fancy that there's plen
ty of opportunity to make up for lost
timeâ believing it even possible to be
among the "honoraries," if only not so
bad as some of his classmates. His idea,
however, of fitness for what he wants to
be permitted to do differs materially from
that of his teachers. The long year to
the lazy boy Is a boon, If measured by the
amount of play he can get into it ; - it is
laughable, though, to see him getting
In his strokes on the home stretch. Some
times he makes itâ more often he falls.
Then, to him. i "his teacher has cheated
and he won't go to that old -school no
more," and m forces his parents to put
him at work, making everybody glad that
at last he finds something -he -will .do.
There will be no more larks for such fool
ish youngsters. Every six months- , the
child must make a new section of grade.
In reality there will be less than flve
months' Btudy, and a bad showing almost
at the outset will seal his fate, and be
knows it and "gets in" and worksâ if he
can. The teacher no longer will have
twinges of conscience about patting back
six months. If she is sure that he cannot
advance at the term's end it will be a mat
ter of little moment whether he review
the weak points of the preceding grade,
or be held for another six months where
he Is. Neither parent nor child feels It
any disgrace to go back one term; but a
year! Fitted or not, most parents want
the children to go on.
Candidly, it is a shame to require a child
to fly wildly over the year's work without
touching ground at all, knowing all the
time that he -will be lifted back bodily
to the beginning twelve months hence.
What a shame that he should for so long
be allowed to delude himself and others â
that he should for a year think only false
alarms had been sounded, and bo forming
such shiftless habits, when life for him
and his should be so serious! Such boys
are some of the recruits for the ranks of
the street Arabs.
Promotions every six months have been
tried before, but just as everything
seemed to be In fine working: or
der a break would occur and the
system be abandoned. Raps between
high Â¦ and grammar schools and again
between grammar and primary schools/
have caused the damage. There seemed
to be nothing continuousâ ninth grade
classes are small and a Christmas gradua
tion will make them smaller and cause
a consolidation In grammar schools unless
fed by the primaries. Is not the selfish
ness of human nature apt to crop out at
thl3 point? Will thÂ© primary schools de
plete their own numbers" and reduce their
rank to make good the losses higher up?
Or "will they fight the rules." and hold
on to all they have and all they may
have, even if they must overload their
classes, notwithstanding grades above are
ready and willing to relieve them? Da
our schools form parts of a whole, or are
they sections, each pursuing a course of
its own, sometimes harmful to its neigh
bor, even at the sacrifice of the child's in
terests?
Is It right to talk "fight" and throw ob
stacles in the way of a system truly eco
npmlcaj-from many points of view, and
for which It should have our good will
our enthuslnsm and our hearty co-opera
tion ? Â¦
The new doctor has much to do. but as
the bad-tasting medicine is really good a
cure may be effected.
Peculiar June Weather.
The officials of the local weather bu
reau have been a little puzzled over ths
present weather conditions along the
coast. From Oregon to Lower California
and east as far as the Rocky Mountains
there are clouds, showers, and in some
places thunder storms of short duration,
which is decidedly out of the ordinary
for June. There does not seem to be a
good and sufficient reason for this, as
there is no evidence of a storm eithor
near or at a remote distance. No damage
has been done by the rain and there is
not much chance that there will be.

(\ DEMAND FOR BIGGER WARSHIPS.
H; XTRAORDINARY projects are reported, to be
under consideration by the British Admiralty.
' â * Experts have advised the construction of bat
tleships upon a scale of magnitude far surpassing
anything yet undertaken in that direction.. The argu
ment is that as Great Britain, by reason of her widely
scattered colonies, must have war vessels with a larger
coal capacity than those "of other nations, it is im
perative that she now enter upon the construction of
a number of such vessels equal in capacity and size
to the Oceanic and other huge passenger steamers of
the Atlantic.
The advocates of the plan assert that large vesseh
will have an advantage over smaller ones not only in
steaming capacity, but also in defensive strength and
fighting force. It is said that by doubling the size
cf the present battleships the new ones would be able
to carry three times the thickness and weight of
armor, and would require only 50 per cent additional
weight and space for engines, boilers and fuel to at
tain to the same speed as the existing ironclad. They
could carry a considerably increased number of heavy
guns capable of sinking vessels of inferior type. They
would have a much stronger platform and greater
stability than ironclads of the present day. They
would probably double their gun power and immeas
urably improve their defensive power, while the ad
dition to the crew r.nd the increased cost of keep
would be only from 50 to 60 per cent over that of exist
ing vessels. The number of watertight compartments
would be on the whole increased. The confidence
of the crew in working their guns would be enhanced,
as the men would know that the ship was proof
against perforation by gun fire.
The arguments appear to be valid, and Great Brit
ain has m6ney enough appropriated for the navy to
justify tRe- Admiralty in constructing at least one of
the huge ships, by way of experiment. If the Â¦result
should justify the expectations of the advocates of
big ships there will be a general reconstruction of
navies ali over the world. What the limit will be no
THE JUBILEE CELEBRATION.
GTAND MARSHAL CQSTELLO in a circular
to the Native Sons has set forth an excellent
plan for g* - ; ng a distinctive form to the cele
bration of the fiftieth anniversary of the admission of
California to statehood. He says: "It is my desire
that the parade should not only eclipse in. brilliancy
and splendor all former parades, but that it should
be an exposition of the industrial and material
progress of the State during the half century now
drawing to a close and a demonstration to visitors
from our sister States and the world at large of the
boundless wealth and unlimited resources of Califor
nia. I would therefore invite the earnest co-operation
of the parlors outside of San Francisco in further
ance of this end. Let the parlors" of each particular
district arrange some special feature or float that will
be emblematic of such loyalty and its particular re
sources and industries."
This suggestion is a happy one. California is a
State of such varied resources that a display of the
characteristic industries of the different sections would
not be in the least monotonous, and that fact in it
self is worth impressing upon the public. Should the
various counties or districts of any other State of the
Union undertake an industrial parade there- would
be only a long procession of floats showing corn or
wheat or cotton, according to the State where ths
cclebration was held. In California, however, there
can and will be displayed a wide diversity of exhibits,
ranging from gold-bearing quartz to orange groves,
from the lumber of giant redwoods to raisins and
wine.
It is a fortunate coincidence that the semi-centennial
of the State corresponds with a year of abounding
prosperity. The people are in a humor for public and
popular rejoicing. The festival of commemoration
will, come as a pleasant break in the Presidential
campaign and give all parties a chance to rid their
minds of partisim rivalries for a time and make a
joint Holiday of loyalty and" State patriotism. Every
prospect for a rousing celebration is propitious, and
it is to be hoped that every good suggestion concern
ing it will be cordially approved and carried out.
THE fruit-can ners were warned by The Call that
the fruit-gro.vers must be treated fairly and per
mitted a natural profit on their product. At
the time this warning was issued there was some in
credulity abroad among the canners, who objected to
the imperative "must." Inasmuch as fruit is a per
ishable article and must be handled when ready and
ripe or it is a total loss, they thought the growers
must come to their terms as to prices. But they have
changed their minds now. The season has opened on
spricots, and the growers have resorted to drying to
such an extent that there is not much prospect of ths
canners getting a very large pack of apricots. The
sun is a monopoly that no other has been able to beat.
It dries fruit cheaper than the canners can fit it for
market in tin, and when dried it is very acceptable to
the consumer. Unless the sun can be induced to come
into the canners' combine it is likely to stand as the
greatest and most independent monopoly that has
ever affected the fruit trade of California. The fruit
grower laughs at the canner and turns his face to the
sun with all the devotion of a fire worshiper.
It is well that we have the monopoly of the sun.
It has made our imperative "must" a vital word in
the fruit business, and when the canner passes the
apricot season and that of peaches and nectarines is
here, we warn him again that he must let the grower
have a decent profit or the sunshine will be put on
tap again and the grower will save his crop and get
his profit anyway. The growers are perfectly well
aware that drying causes a falling off in t^e canned
pack, and they also know that a scarcity of canned
fruit compels a resort to the dried irticle. So while
they are asserting their independence of everything
except their monopoly partner, the sun, they are also
raising the price of their dried fruit in the market by
decreasing the supply of its rival in the cans.
So the growers seem to be in pretty good shape to
resist the combine, and as long as the sun of Califor
nia shines with that constancy which is one of the
charms of the State the canners will see that they
must do as we told them would be wise.
It is a simple live and let live proposition. The
producer of the raw material takes 99 per cent of the
risk, and it is not fair that the canner, who takes I
per cent of the risk, should have 09 per cent of the
profit. If a sense of business justice prevail the two
will get on together and both do well. If not, the sun
still shines and dries more fruit with less fuss than
anything that man has invented.
THE SUN MONOPOLY.
ThjE MIKflDO TAKES ACTION.
K| \EPORTS from Washington announce that in
formation has been received by the adminis
tration that the Japanese Government has is
sued an order designed to restrict emigration to the
United Statds and to Canada. The Action is'said to
be due to the fact that the influx of the lower class,
of Japanese into this country and British .Columbia
has aroused antagonism, and the Government fears
that if it be not checked the results will be injurious
to the trade of Japan and the interests of the better
classes of her people.
According to the reports the order' of restriction <
provides "that an average of only five persons may
emigrate to the United States in one month from any
of the forty-seven prefectures in Japan. The same
order was put into effect 'in 'regard to Canada, except
that double that number will be 'allowed to go to the
Dominion from each prefecture. * In order to prevent
emigrants to Canada from crossing the border into
the United States and thus evading the intention of
the law it is announced that the Japanese Govern
ment will inaugurate a system of examinations at.
ports of debarkation, if it be found that the spirit of
the order is evaded." v\ ;â¢_=Â¦%Â¦ /-*;
The promulgation of such an order to go into effect
at once is of course highly gratifying to the United
States and relieves the administration of what threat
ened to be a vexatious problem ,of diplomacy. Ever
since the exposure made by The Call of the extent to
which Japanese immigration ta the Pacific Coast had
developed it has been recognized that something
should be -done to put a stop to the evil. The only
way by which a remedy could be applied was by
arranging a new treaty with japan under which a
Japanese exclusion act might be enacted on lines
similar to that which excludes the Chinese. Had the
Government of the Mikado interposed objections to
such a new treaty considerable time would have
elapsed before we could have overcome them, or by
summarily denouncing the treaty leave Congress free
to interpose restriction on such terms as it choose.
The action of the Japanese Government solves the
problem by providing for restriction at once, and in
a way that promises to be thoroughly effective and
satisfactory.
By promptly conforming to the desires of the
United States on this question the Japanese officials
have given another evidence of that sagacious
statesmanship which within a few years has raised
Japan from the rank of a comparatively barbarian
state to be one of the strongest empires of the world.
Japan is now a well-ordered Government, open to
every influence of civilization, and guided by wise
leaders. Her Government has shown itself capable of
dealing in the right way with every issue that
arises, and has now given another proof of its diplo
matic skill in avoiding complications that might have
made enemies out of a people naturally disposed to be
friendly.
LET CH.INA ALONE.
UP to the time that England announced her in
tention to force a passage from Tientsin to
Peking the casualties to foreigners in China, by
the Boxer riots, were less in number jthan the lynch
ings of Chinese and Italians in the United States, by
mobs. Only our capability for defense protected us
against just such a raid as we are invited to join
against China. The pretext of murder and violence
was more aggravated in our case than in hers.
It is evident that Europe is hot for conquest and
prey. If the predatory nations were not afraid of
each other, the carving would be in progress now.
We desire to go upon record that it is not to the in
terest of the world's peace nor the happiness of its
people that China be partitioned and its polity dis
turbed. The opening of that country to the world has
not paid a dividend. Its civilization has made its
people absolutely non-assimilable. They go forth
ji'.stified by the fact that opening their country to the
world opened the world to them. But wherever they
appear they retain every racial and national charac
teristic. Stubbornly resisting change, they add no
fresh current to any national life, in a physical sense.
They abide everywhere, a foreign substance in the
body of the nation they invade. But while this is true
of them abroad from their own country, it is also true
of Caucasians in China. Our race takes on neither
character nor strength from any Chinese contact.
Such a nation should be let alone. It should be per
mitted to adopt, in its own time and way, the dte
coveries and applications of art and science to econo
mic purposes, which so largely make up the form
and substance of Western civilization.
In the first place, to attempt the substitution of the
industrial system of China will produce results appall
ing to the world.. The subjection of industry to
manual processes there is consistent with the im
mense population which must earn food. The intro
duction of our labor-aiding mechanical devices would
obsolete the labor and "take away all hope of sup
port of two hundred and fifty millions of people, at
least We are disquieted now by the Indian famine,
but it will be remembered as a feast and season of
plenty compared with what would in China follow a
displacement of the existing industrial system.
Again, such policy would at last react upon the
world.. That human hive, which sends out but small
swarms to afflict wherever they light, if driven in des
peration to live after its industrial foundations are
changed, will swarm no more, but will flood the world
with its products at a labor cost on a par with the
bare price of existence. Then Chinese industrial dis
tress will spread to the nations which have brought it
upon her.
The United States will do well to keep out of the
gathering of nations now on Chinese soil 'and ex
pressing their horror at the mote in the Chinese eye,
for which they see no cure but. a dastardly attack
upon that empire. Fr.ch has a beam in its own eye,
but it is a civilized and Christian beam. The law
less persecution and slaughter of the defenseless are
wrong only when a heathen nation practices them.
When a nation that votes itself civilized i.-A Christian
does even worse, it is set down to the mysterious
working of the inscrutable ways of Provide r.-*e.
When the vulture nations that are invited to gorge
the fiesh and polish.the bones of China do something
that revolts human nature and sickens the heart of
humanity, they always lay it upon Divinity. Indeed,
that seems to be the chief political advantage of being
a Christian nation. When such a nation does any
thing too mean and greedy and cruel for human de
fense, it pleads the guidance of a Higher Power.
Heathen nations, even in the enjoyment of a state
religion, do not enjoy this rare advantage. They
have to lie and steal and murder on their own ac
count. They lay nothing to their gods. This is one
evidence that they are benighted and that they have
no rights which the Christian nations are bound to
respect.
The Chinese heathen in his blindness is opposed to
the overrunning and rough carving of his country by
the foreigners. He is aware that when the Chinese
become too thick in this country or in the British
colonies it is the practice to thin them out with a
gun, or, as we did in Wyoming, by burning them in
lots of 250 at a time, like rats in a strawstack. As
the Boxer, instead of renting a pew, bows down to
wood and stone, he does not understand that these
thinning processes arc the prerogative of Christian
nations only, so he begins a career of rank imitation
of our methods, whereupon the Christian nations
land marines and machine-guns and proceed to pun
ish him, oblivious that imitation is the sincerest form
cf flattery.
It is to be hoped that this country will notify the
assembled buzzards that will not take a claw in the
business. "We have enough laying upon our con
science now, unassimilated, without overloading it
v.-ith any more of the same sort of folly. We should
refuse to join the hungry flock that has impudently
proposed to organize a planetary trust in govern
ment and permit no nation to exist without its con
sent.
man can say. Perhaps warships may some day be
come so big they cannot enter the average harbor,
and then the nations will have to alter the world so
as to make it fit the ships.

ST. JAMES PARISH PICNIC
AT EL CAMPO SATURDAY
The feast of St. Anthony of Padua was
celebrated yesterday in the French
Church, Notre Dame des Vlctoires. on
Bush street. The altar where the Image
of St. Anthony reposes was decorated
with roses and throughout the -day the
Bhrlne was the object of much devotion.
There were three masses celebrated In
honor of the saint, at 7. 8 and 9 o'clock
In the morning, respectively.
There Is a pretty little story connected
with the origin of the feast of St. An
thony. Several years ago In a little vill
age of France a devoted and benevolent
churchwoman made a devotion to this
saint and promised to give a certain sum
to the poor in his name, provided her
prayer was answered. The neighbors
Joined with the pious lady in her devotion
and soon many of the adjoining villages
were making simllnr offerings. The devo
tion continued to spread- and before long
all of France was making promises in
St. Anthony's name. The French church
was the first to introduce the feast of
St. Anthony in this city and now all the
local Catholics unite In celebrating the
day. ; _ -

supervisor of this branch in the School
Department, will arrive in this city about
June 15 and on his arrival will confer
with the School Directors regarding the
installation of manual training depart
ments in at least four grammar schools.
Those at present contemplated include
the Franklin. Clement. Horace Mann and
Pacific Heights schools, but the number
may be increased should the demands
and the state of the funds warrant it.
Chairman Mark in outlining the pro
posed innovation yesterday said:
"We intend to put in the best manual
training plants we can afford and will
pattern them after the one now In ope
ration at the California School of Me
chanical Arts, but necessarily on a
smaller scale. It will cost about $100") to
install the system in each of the four
schools, and while we expect to hive a
surplus in the funds of about $20,000 we
aro not quite certain yet as to how much
will be available for this purpose.
"We have so far decided to Inaugurate
the system known as 'Sloyd,' which com
prises the elements of manual training.
The pupil will be taught carpentry, me
chanics and drawing with a view to liis
creating some simple mechanical device
and to develop the power of hi3 hands.
Pupils of the seventh and eighth grades
will be eligible to take the course, but
girls will be excluded^

WASHINGTON, June 13.-The Navy
Department has completed the prepara
tion of a circular calling for bids fo
supplying armor plate in the navy and
it will be ready for Issuance as soon as
certain typographical changes have been
made.
For the first time the department has
adopted the policy of classifying the ar
mor called for in the advertisement. Un
der the price heretofore paid for armor
it was scarcely worth while to make any
distinction between the various grades
of armor required. At the enhanced price
now prevailing a considerable saving can
be effected by classifying the amor.
Thus, the advertisement calls first for the
highest quality face-hardened armor
treated by Krupp process. The second
class is composed of armor of generally
lesser thickness than class 1. used in
plates, where the requirements are not so
severe, and in this case the ordinary har
veyized armor- will serve. Class 3 will
be made up of thin plates, bolts nuts
etc.. material not requiring any kind of
hardening process. The latter require
ment is that the manufacturers must fur
nish armor of a certain specified grade.
The new circular contains an important
addition in that the armormakers are to
supply armor of the very highest grade.
Under that clause if there are improve
ments in production tending to enhance
the quality of the armor the contractors
must give them to the Government with
out any extra cost.
The circular, as already forecasted, pro
vides* for the reception of bids for three
specified quantities of armor, and the
largest quantity needed Is called for at
once to test the ability of the Government
to secure a reduction in price of armor
by placing a large order.
The ordnance bureau has not yet been
acquainted with the reported intention of
the great steel working concerns In the
United States to enter into competition
with the two companies which have sup
plied armor for the navy heretofore. It
is known to the bureau that this particu
lar concern has spent a large amount of
money during the past year In very exten
sively enlarging its plants, but so far
as is known the additions are adaptable
to the production of commercial steel and
are not specifically I devised for armor
making.

JCEW YORK. June 13.â Prices advanced early
to-day under the twofold Influence of a bet
ter tcne on foreign Ftock markets and som?
relief Vy rain for "the drought stricken dis
tricts lr. the NorthTvrÂ«t. Tho Fmallness of the
demand from the *hort interest was a com
mentary on the liFtlessness of the recent bear
speculation, notwithstanding the highly alarm
ing rumois which have circulated regarding
conditions in the spring wheat belt. The move
ment In the wheat n:arkets Indicated that the
fate of the spring wheat crcp is Uy no means
yet decided. The Northwestern grain carrying
reads in fact failed to share in the strength
of the day'* market and the grangers as a
Croup came late into the movement. Baltimore
ar.d Ohio radiated a strengthening Influence
throughout en the excellent showing made in
Its May Ftatement cf net earnings and the
fnvcrable predictions made by President Cowen
cf the results to be csj.ected from.thÂ« heavy
coal traffic. Norfolk ar.4 Wostern was helped
fr-orc the same cause. New York Central, as
a trunk line, ehowr-d tjrapmXhy. London was
ft buyer here to the extent cf about 20.000
chares and established the high rar.ge of prices.
After the arbitrage brokers had ceased to
operate the market becam* exceedingly nar
row and tlEtlers. with little cf note. The
strength of Americans In London was at
tributed to the reins in the Northwxst. Pro
fessional traders here also laid norne stress
on the expected arrival late to-day cf a pr-jin
lr.ent finunV-lcr from a visit in Europe. The
export Ot $3,:/"0,00o In gold, a figure in excess
of the tstimatPS. had no ffTect m-hatevw r.n
the Block market. A feature of the day was
Ihe rally In steel stocks, due to reports of pros
pects of an enlarging export demand for iron.
The market closed Urm and with gains vc-ll
maintained. The Etrrngth In foreign Mock
market* was attributed to the easier money
conditions In London and to thn expectation I
that the Bank of England woulJ reduce its I
official discount rate to-morrow. The payment j
of an installment of . the British war loan
and the taiciiijr up to-fiay cf a loan for the
London County Council of t2S.CCO.C00 having
faiied to harden the LonCon money market
there Is no further reason lipparent for the
maintenance' of the bank rate so far above
the jrlvate discount rate. The local money
inarUet shows a sUshtly firmc-r undertone, but
no Quotable changes as a result of the pold
exports. The -tub-treasury operations show that
the process of takinc up the second Install
ment of Government deposits amounting to
{;.000.009"hae not commenced and there are

CHICAGO, June 13.â Wheat was Irregular
but firm following a weak opening. Good rains
were reported from South Dakota and Min
nesota and this was sufficient for a drop in
prices. July opening 9iÂ«ric under yesterday at
72?ic to 72^c. The Northwest was a buyer
from the start, however. North Dakota and
Manitoba were still in need of moisture and
sent in a flood of unfavorable reports. For
many of the counties where rain had fallen
only half a crop was claimed. The steady
Northwest buying looked as if the rain had
come almost too late. The situation in China
was also of some help tn the recovery. July
rallied during the forenoon to 74c. Later, on
profit -taking, it reacted to 73%c, but steadied
and ihe close was firm, July a shade up at
73>:''i73^c.
The corn market was firm and fairly active.
The opening was off half a cent on local sell
ing and sympathy with the wheat weakness.
July rallied over a cent and though there was
some reaction from the top the closÂ» was firm.
July closed a shade under yesterday at 3S%c.
Oats were quiet but firm. There was a good
outside demand which was caused mainly by
reported Injuries to the Northwest hay crop.
Dakota and Minnesota reports of the condition
in these States were unfavorable. July closed
unchanged at 22%c
Provisions were weak. Hog receipts were
largo and the selling pressure met a slack
demand. July pork closed 22%c under yester
day at $11 25; July lard. 12',4c down at $6 55,
and July ribs J2',i@15c depressed 'at {6 55.

BOSTON, June 13.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: As for the
time for the opening of the light weight sea
son draws nearer consumers of wool are natur
ally more inclined to look over the market and
quite a number of them have been In during
the past week, testing prices for such wools
as they are likely to want. As a result there
has been more activity, the sales of the wÂ»ek
asgreiratinK slightly over 2,000,000 pounds. Al
though It is thought that this is a forerunner
for larcer transactions in wool it Is believed
that consumers will purchase very cautiously
until> more definite knowledge is at hand as to
how the light weight season is open. The de
mand has shown more preference for medium
and low wools, fine wool being draggy. Prices
are practically unchanged. In the territories
the situation has been subject to very little
change, but In a few cases an inclination to
weaken haa been noticeable among the grow
ers. 4

vertiser's London financial cablegram eays:
The markets here were quiet and irreg[Ular to
day, investment securities being depressed by
fears of dearer money and the Issue by the
London County Council of a nve-million 3 per
cent loan at 97H- This Is the first time a
fixed price has been adopted. Previously ten
ders have been asked. The favorable war news
failed to affect general sentiment. Americans
were more favored, London, however, await
ing the Northern Pacific dividend as a clew
to the spring wheat condition, thinking that if
the condition is bad the dividend will be 1 per
cent, while the declaration of 2 per cent will
mean that the rumors of damage have been
exaggerated. London is Inclined to pin its
faith on the Southwestern crops even if the
spring crop falls. It thinks the bears are clos-
Inc their contracts In New York. Baltimore
and Ohio was strong on its montjily statement.
The bank sold Â£100,000 gold in French coin
and lost Â£5000 to South Africa. The selling
price of French coin will probably be raised
to-morrow. Call money was up too, owing to
the war loan Installment pa>ment.
LONDON. June 13.â The an;ount of bullion
withdrawn from the Rank ot England on bal

ground that' there was no money In- the

claimed there was money In the treas

destroyed by fire last night. John Hiltel,
the husband of Mrs. Hiltel, has been ar

KILLED FOR TAKING
AN OFFICER'S SWORD
PROFESSOR SEIFERT HAD
NO MONEY IN THE BANK
Prominent Pharmacist Held for Ob
taining Money by False
Pretenses.
Charles A, Soifert, druggist and mem
ber of the. State Pharmacy Board and
of the faculty of the State College of
Pharmacy, was yesterday held in $1000
bonds by Judge Cabaniss to answer be
fore the Superior Court to a charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses.
Selfert lives at 860 Haight street and
the complaining witness against him is
John Beuttler. a butcher at 7*s2 Haight
street. Seifert owed Beultler a bill
amounting to $15 25 and June 2 gave him
a check on the Columbian Hank for $100,
receiving the balance of $S4 75. When the
check was presented at the bank Beuttier
was told that Selfert had only $2 50 to his
credit. Seifert made no effort to adjust
the matter with Beuttler, hence his ar
rest.
Seifert came into prominence recently
in connection with the pharmacy exami
nation scandals. He was openly accused
of offering to sell sets of questions for
$100 and more, but the evidence was not
sufficient to fasten the crime upon him.
He has held the position of pharmacist
at both the German and the City and
County Hospital.
Committee Meets and Listens to the
Reports of the Various Sub
committees.
The Fourth of July general committee,
Horace Wilson presiding, met last night
at the California Hotel and listened to
the reports of the various sub-commit
tees.
By recommendation to the main body.
it was decided to do away with the pro
posed regatta on account of lack of funds.
The literary committee recommended that
something out of the ordinary be arrang- j
ed for this year. For an orator, it was
the opinion of all that a man be chosen
who Is prominent in the forensic world
and who has a reputation as a spell
binder. Mr, Pond of the decoration com
mittee recommended that an arch be con
structed on City Hall Square.
A tentative estimate of money allowed
the various committees was as follows:
Printing, $100; music, $$00; carriages, $70;
fireworks, $1000: literary exercises, $300,
contingencies, $100. No money will be ex
pended on general decorations.
General R. H. Warfield was elected
grand marshal at the meeting last night.

acid. The unfortunate woman had been
out during the day looking for work which
had been promised her. She was disap
pointed, and on returning to her home
she purchased a quantity of carbolic acid
with part of $1 which she had received a
few days ago from a pawnshop on her
wedding ring, which she reluctantly part
ed with to procure food.
Mrs. McCarthy's suffering from the
burning acid attracted the attention of
her neighbors, who summoned the police.
She was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where remedies were applied. Hopes of
her recovery are entertained by the hos
pital physicians. -<s

GREAT VICTORY FOR
MONTANA MINERS
Senator Clark and August Heinze
Voluntarily Heduce the Working
Day to Eight Hours.
BUTTE, Mont., June 11â Miners' Union
day was celebrated to-day and will be
the most memorable in the history of the
camp. During the exercises in the Opera
house, following the procession, letters
were read from Senator W. A. Clark and
F. August Heinze. the latter the head of
the Montana Ore Purchasing Company,
granting the miners in their employ their
request for an eight-hour working day.
In his letter Senator Clark says:
I realize the hazardous character of labor In
the mints and that it increases with depth of
the working by reason of difficulty of ventila
tion and other reasons. I am satisfied that
the demand for shortening the time for a. day's
work to eight hours in all underground work-
Ings Is not an unreasonable one, and I have
given instructions to the superintendents of all
my mines to adopt the eight-hour system be
ginning the ISth instar.t.
The Heinze letter says:
It ts undoubtedly a fact that no occupation
is more hazardous than that , of the under
ground miner. He assumes more risks than
ether laborers, and the accidents to which he
is subjected are most disastrous. The profits
of tfco*e engagf-d in mining have greatly in
creased in the last few years through the rise
in the price of copper, but the underground
miner has had no share in this prosperity.
On acd after to-day, the anniversary of the
Butte .Miners' fnion, the miners In the em
ploy of all mires in which I have a controlling
voice shall receive the present Â«cale of wages
for a day's work of eight hours.
Both announcements were received with
cheors. Everybody is celebrating the
event.

OAKLAND, June 13.â It was not until
the last moments of the water rate
hearing before Judge Hart of Sac
ramento to-day that anything start
ling occurred. All day long Judge Hart
had listened to arguments by Robert Y.
Hayne for the city of Oakland why he
should not sit as the trial Judge in the
case, and to the efforts of Attorneys A.
A. Moore and E. J. McCutcheon of the
Contra Ccsta Water Company to convince
him that he should not be "scared" from
the bench or "driven" therefrom by the
whim? of Mr. Hayne.
When the sensation did come It was In
the shape of a direct charge that the pres
ent water trial was a political case and
that Judge K. C. Hart was disqualified
from sitting therein because he was inti
mately connected in a political way with
some of the stockholder* of the Contra
Costa Water Company.
First, Mr. Hayne asked Judge Hart if
he was not a member of the Republican
State "Central Committee and if he were
not intimately connected with the man
agement of the party. Though nothing
was said directly, this was aimed at Al
vinza Havward. who is connected with
Judge Hart on the State Committee and
is Interested also in the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company.
There was a large attendance last ntght
in Odd Fellows' Hall at the delightful en
tertainment given by the Social and Lit
erary Club of the National Union. The
programme follows:
Barytone Â»o!o, "A May Morning" (Denia).

U. S. A., George A. Dennison; Rick Fetter (a
planter). Will Ogilvle: Aunt Helena. Miss May
Sullivaa: Barbara, Miss Jean Baldwin; Sach
arrissa. Misa Xeule Hynes.
At the close of the programme there
was dancing until midnight. The affair
was under the direction of W. W. Healey,
E. A. Kidd. J. N. Bunting and F. H.
Hastings. H. A. Graves was chairman ot
the evening.
NATIONAL UNION SOIREE
IN ODD FELLOWS' HALL
"I am perfectly willing to admit that I
am a member of such a committee." re
plied Judge Hart
"What has that got to do with this
case?" demanded A. A. Moore suspi
ciously.
"I will tell you what it has got to do
with this case." replied Mr, Hayne. "This
is a political case, and it Is pimply one
more reason whv Judge Hart should not
sit herein. Look about this room and you
find It crowded with politicians. The lead
ing stockholders of the company are poli
ticians and members of the party, if not
of the political bodies, with which Judge
Hart is connected." ,
"The suggestion that this is a political
case Is but a confirmation of the state
ment that commercialism is overcoming
the legal profession. It ha3 hecome so
that ever> - edge is made to cut in law, and
practitioners study means and methods
of winning out irrespective of the law,"
declared A. A. Moore. "I note this with
surprise, for I belle\ - ed that Judge Hayne
was a follower of the old school. No man
has a right to say that this is a political
cape, for no man knows what may be the
politics of the stockholders of this corpor
ation. It is a shameful and an awful
thing to say that this is a political case
and a political corporation and that the
Judge on the bench is a political Judge
that can be swayed by any such connec
tion."
AliAMEDA, June 13.â Under the auÂ»
pices of the Catholic Ladles' Aid Society
funeral services were held last evenlns
at S:30 o'clock over the remains of Mrs.
Ellen D. St. Sure at her late residence,
2312 Central avenue. A large number of
the friends cf the deceased, including
members of Branch No. 3 of the Catholic
Ladles' Aid Society, to which she be
longed, were present. The floral pieces
were numerous and beautiful.
Rev. Father F. A. Foley, pastor of St.
Joseph's Church, delivered a touching
eulogy- of the deceased after having said
the prayers. He spoke of- her many vir
tues and the 'works "of charity in which
she was greatly interested during her
lifetime. Following the address by Father
Foley came the services of the Aid So
ciety, led by Miss Garrlty of San FranÂ»
Cisco. They were very impressive.
This morning the body was taken to
Oroville, where the funeral will be held
from St. Thomas' Church to-morrow
morning at 9 o'clock.
SERVICES OVER RER1AINS OF
MRS. ELLEN D. ST. SURE
Special Counsel Eoberi Y. Hayne Addressing: th3 Court.
MUST NOW ANSWER THE
SUIT ON ITS MERITS
Demurrer of Telephone Company la
Dr. Klonk's Action Is
Overruled,
Justice of the Peace Groezinger yester
day overruled the demurrer of the de-
fendant in tha case of Dr. Max Klonk
against the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company. The action was brought
to recover 1299 damages, Klonk alleging
that he was a subscriber of the telephone
companv in good standing and that cer
tain of his patients tried to communicate
with him. but were informed that he had
i:o telephone. In consequence of this neg
ligence the physician was prevented from
rendering service to numerous patients.
The telephone company demurred on the
ground that the damages claimed were too
remote; that the company did not under
take to hold and save harmless each of its
1S.0OO subscribers from all poss'ble loss
they might sustain by failing to> commu
nicate with i he parties desiring to speal:
to them, and that the patienta of Dr.
Klonk alone have eau3e of action, aa he
did not try to communicate with any one.
they ringing him up.
"I believe that the majority of the
members of the City Council are Republi
can," interposed Mr. MeCutoheon.
"1 hope that some of them are not,"
replied Mr. Moore. Then he added: "It
has become a truism that corporations do
not have politics, and this is a shame
ful charge."
All that Judge Hart said In response to
this new attack upon his right to sit in
the case was to announce that he had a
trial In Sacramento to-morrow and that
he would take the entire matter under
advisement, and would render his decision
in writing in a few days.
Judge Hart, as judge, sat and listened
to arguments and testimony about him
self, and literally sat in judgment upon
his own ability to try the ca?e. These
arguments could not help but be of a
personal nature and. as Judge Hart de
clared several times, were very embar
rassing, but he refused to take advantage
of the loopholes offered by the special at
torney for the city and continued to listen
to the embarrassing arguments and to
face the unpleasant situation.
Mr. Hayne did not shirk any of the
responsibility Incurred by his statement
of yesterday, though he said he regretted
that Judge Hart had asked him specifical
ly whether he was wanted in the case
or not. To this Judge Hart replied that
he had asked the question in good faith
and expected an answer in good faith, and
he expressed his intention of passing up
on this point aa if he were not a factor
In it. To this Mr. Hayne replied that
no matter what the good intentions of a
man might be in such a case, tne uncon
scious workings of his mind would be
such as to make impartial action impos
sible.
Mr. Hayne contended that Judge O&den
being disqualified from Bitting In the case
himself had no right to choose a judge
to occupy his place, and held that the
selection of another judge had not been
carried out in the form- the law required.
E. J. McC'utcheon made a long argument
to show that Judge Hart had a right to
sit, and so the case stands until Judge
Hart renders his decision upon himself.
Offered to Help Theodore Johnson
Make His Will and Brought
Trouble-
Mary E. Johnson, widow of Theodore
Johnson, filed a petition in the Probate
Court yesterday asking for permission to
probate a copy of a holographic will made
by her husband, but afterward destroyed.
In her petition she asserts that John
son made a will on March S, 1900. and
after making !t he showed It to Frank R.
Neville, It was entirely in Johnson's
handwriting and was signed by him, and
it was written on two sheets of paper.
Neville told him there was danger of the
will being thrown out' if It was not writ
ten on one sheet, and he offered to copy
the document on one sheet on a type
writer. Johnson gave him the will and
Neville copied It. He gave the typewrit
ten copy to Johnson, who signed it, and
Neville witnessed it and destroyed the or
iginal. As there is but one witness to the
will and it is not holographic, it U use
less, for wills not holographic must have
two witnesses. The petitioner, therefore,
asked to be allowed to probate a oopy of
the original.
Johnson left all his estate, valued at
J5000. to his wife and mother.

FRAH5L', June 12.â A letter has just been re
ceived from the Governor of the Gold Coast
(Sir F. H. Hodgscn). dated Kumassi, June 4.
It ts as brief as possible. Following is Its sub
stance:
On several occasions unsuccessful attempts
have been mad< to get cd letters. He informs
me that he enclosed a copy of another of May
4, which 1 have not received.
Kumasi U garrisoned by 500 native troops
and in command of Major Harris, acting
commissioner and commandant of the North
ern Territories, who has succeeded in enter
ing the place from the north.
The Europeans and other troops are on half
rations. The supplies of ammunition at Kum
assi are not sufficient to allow offensive meas
ure? and must be husbanded In case of the re
enforeements cot arriving.
The march of the relief of Kuma*sl will be
met by great numbers of rebels, who have con
structed stockades and put impediments in the
way, such as trees. There are also Â»tcx*kartes
surrounding Kumassi, offering th* rebels gcntl
shelter. The rebel* have places built In trees,
from which to oÂ»en tire.
The state of health of Kumassi U good, but
3000 persons of the native community axe in a.
state of destitution. Immediate assistance is
required.

AT KUMASSI
INDIANAPOLIS, June 13.â Governor
Mount to-night issued a statement declin
ing to honor a requisition from Governor
Ueckharn for the return to Kentucky ol
William S. Taylor, who is under indict
ment for complicity in an alleged plot
which resulted in the assassination of
Governor Goebel. .
Colonel Thcmas G. Campbell, Justis
Goebel, brother of the murdered man, and
Sheriff Suter of Franklin County, Ky.,
arrived here this afternoon with the requi
sition. They met the Governor in the ex
ecutive paxiors and at his orders every
one was excluded during the arguments,
including reporters.
After hearing the arguments Governor
Mount asked for the papers in the ease,
which included copies of the evidence, and
said he would consider the matter. He
did. not know when he would decide. The
Kentuckiaus then left the city for Louls
vijle and Cincinnati.
Late to-night Governor Mount an
nounced his decision refusing to honor the
requisition. In his statement he says:
"1 don't believe a fair and Impartial trial
can or will at this time be given Mr.
Taylor. When Judge Cantrtll ot the trial
court at Franklin declares that he would
not subject a sheep-killing dog to a trial
under such circumstances as exist, may I
not justly refuse to send Mr. Taylor back
to be subjected to a trial with this preju
dice Intensified and fanned into hate.
When a man who Is a controlling spirit
in the prosecution, a witness in this case
and prominent in Its councils, uses the
monstrous language that when they
should pet control they would hang Re
publicans 'like pigs to a pole' (and these
anarchistic words have not. to my knowl
edpe. been denied), the question of guilt
seems of little consequence In this con
spiracy against innocent men, the fur
therance of which is indicated by indict
ments found by a partisan Grand Jury.
Upon such finding- is based the requisition
papers; which I now refuse to honor."
Governor Mount include* in his state
ment a denunciation of the alleged injus
tice of the Goebel election law, and as
serts that Mr. Taylor has been robbed of
the office to which the people of Ken
tucky elected him. In conclusion he says:
"Another phase of the question that de
serves to be challenged Is the action of the
General Assembly in setting aside the
enormous sum of J100.TXM as a reward for
the conviction of persons "suspected of
having been concerned in the killing of
Mr. Goebel. That of itself is accepted by
all right thinking people as a tempting in
vitation for the propagation of wholesale
perjury and a premium on moral and phy
sical assassination.
The Governor's statement is in the form
of a letter addressed to Governor Beck
bam.
"Until those already In prison have
been accorded a fair trial, thus demon
strating the possibility of securing justice
in your courts, I cannot honor your re
quisition. When the time shall have como
that I can feel assured that a fair trial
will be accorded Mr. Taylor, then, and
not until then, will I honor a requisition
for his return."
Declares That He Has Every Reason
to Believe That a Fair Trial
Would Not Be
Granted.

Eesults in Change of Diet Are Won-
"Good food, .properly selected, will,
in rny opinion, cure almost any ordinary

with considerable care and anxiety.
Some time ago I had a severe case of
the grippe and after recovering from it
had a serious time following, as many
people do.
"I was unable to get well until I
changed rny diet, leaving off Mocha and

An answer to the cult for divorce in
the case of Charles H. Smith vs. Jose
phine Smith was filed in. the Superior
Court yesterday afternoon.
The case in one* form or. another has
claimed the attention of the courts for
more than seven years, the first action
being one by the defendant for separate
support and maintenance.
Smith has been In the employ of the
Southern Pacific Railroad for a number
of years, acting In the capacity of cash
ier to- the Treasurer of that company.
The couple were married in 1878'and have
a son aged about 20 years. The boy has
taken sides with hie mother and. actord
lng to the father's complaint, has taken
active Issue against him.
Mrs. Smith left her husband May 2, 1892,
on account, she alleges, of his cruel treat
ment, and a year later . through her at
torney. Carroll Cook, brougnt the suit for
separate maintenance and support. The
decree granted her an allowance of 1100
p^r month, which amount was paid by her
husband from the- time or the issuance
of the decree until January of this year,
when he commenced the divorce proceed
ing. Mrs. Smith maintains that she had
often been asked by her husband to seek
divorce or to allow him to do so, but She
has steadfastly refused on account of re
11 InÂ°hls complaint Smith alleges that since
hifl.wlfe received legal separation without
divorce she. has harassed and annoyed
him continually and has written letters
to him in which she accused him of theft,
cruelty and desertion and charged him
with all sorts of primes and Â¦ pract cea;
that on many occasions she has insulted
him on the street, Â«n his office or wher
ever an opportunity offered; that she hay
more than once threatened to kill mm anrt
with the assistance of her son carmrto
his room and beat him and horsewhipped
In her answer Mrs. Smith denies all. of
the important allegations and makes sep
arate charges against her husband. -She
alleges that he on . many -occasions dis
played violent fits Â¦ of passion and would
break the furniture, kick and beat her
and her then infant son; that on one oc
casion Mr. Smith was arrested on Morton
street for the alleged - stealing from a
dressmaker of a dress pattern which .waa
being made for his wife and . that at hU
request she secured his release- from
P1 On D one occasion.. Mrs.- Smith alleges, her
husband allowed her.to.be grossly insult
ed by N. P. Smith, the treasurer : of the
Southern Pacific ' Company, and refused
to protect her; that while she was leaving
the building her husband met her in the
hallway and pressed a pistol to her head
and threatened to kill her. â¢ .
The answer filed by Mrs; Smith is a
typewritten affair of many pages and al
leges many acts of cruelty and,Indiscre
tion. She denies In toto the charges
against > her and pleads limitation. . T.ne
letters, which are made part of her hus
band's complaints she does not deny, but
claims that they. were private correspond
ence and that any publicity given them
was by Mr. Smith. Mrs: Smith ,1s repre
sented by Samuel" M. Shortridge. â¢

NATIVE SONS BUSY WITH
ADMISSION DAY FETE
What the Celebration Will Consist
Of to Be Determined Upon
To-Morrow. i
At the meeting of the joint ninth of
September celebration committee of the
Native Sons of the Golden West to-mor
row night there will be presented the plan
of the celebration as outlined by the com
mittee on scope, which will be acted upon
promptly, as, until it is- determined what
will be done, the subcommittee will not
be able to make much progress.
The general Idea now Is that there
should be a naval parade on the night of
Saturday, the 8th, and an Illumination of
the city; that Sunday should be devoted
to church going and visiting the Park,
Cliff and other resorts; that on Monday
the grand parade and literary exercises
should be held and that Tuesday should
be filled with excursions on the bay dur
ing tho day time and a grand ball at
night.
Sunday will ' be the 9th, Admission
day, and that being a legal holiday Mon
day will be observed by the commercial
world. It is proposed to ask the Gover
nor to declare Tuesday 'a legal holiday
also, so that there shall be no interruption
in the festivities. Â¦>
There were a number of visitors at
headquarters In the Palace Hotel yester
day to obtain general information in rela
tion to the celebration. Next week the
headquarters will be opened at night as
well as by day and there will always- bo
some one In attendance.
Grand Marshal Costello received a let
ter from California Parlor yesterday, an
nouncing that the members will parade
In dark blue uniforms, the coats being or
namented with black braid frogs; the caps
will be similar to the fatigue cap of the
Knights Templar. On the coat collar will
be the letters X. S. G. "W"., and on the
front of the cap will be a wreath of
laurel with the figure 1 in the center. .
Stanford Parlor will make one of the
finest displays among those of the local
parlors. There have already been ordered
120 uniforms similar to the fatigue uni
form of the United States navy. The
coat collar will be adorned with "76," the
number of the parlor. Several attractive
features are being prepared by this par
lor.
E. M. Elsfelder, a member of Bay City
Parlor, has volunteered to decorate tho '
headquarters In the Palace Hotel and will
commence' work this morning. The pre
vailing colors will be Ted, white and
blue, to represent the patriotism of thÂ«
Native Sons, and gold to represent the
State.
THE steamer Mariposa. which sailed
for Honolulu yesterday, carried away
a haripy pair of elopersâ Al R. Hill
iary and Carrie Henninger. bound
hard and fast in the holy bonds of matri
mony in ppite of a frowning, opposing
mair.ma-!n-law. It was the old storyâ a
daughter choosing as her heart and not
her mother dictated and a splendid fellow
frowned down upon because he had not
as much of this world's goods as the girl
he loved.
Hilliary and Miss Hennlnger were mar
ried on Tuesday evening. Justice Barry
united the loving couple at his home, 417
Van Nes? avenue. Harry Brennan sup
ported the groom and Miss Kitty Gorman
acted as maid of honor. In spite of the
hurried and necessarily private features
of the wedding-, the charming bride was
appropriately dressed in an exquisite
lace gown. Naturally, no cards were is
sued for the affair, but after the ceremony
a number of friends joined the newly
wedded couple tit Zinkand's. where many
bumpers were drunk to their future good
health and happiness.
The beautiful -youn^ bride Is the daupn
ter of Mrs. B. Henningor. a wealthy
widow, and Al Hilliary. the groom, is a
well-known wine merchant of this. city.
The journey to Honolulu will be the bridal
trip of the young couple, but thev are to
stay there, for the husband is to be man
ager of one of the best known cafes in
lu Isl . ands - Another charming feature of
tne elopement was the announcement
through it of the engagement of Miss
Gorman and Mr. Brennan. who, by the
way, will adhere to the generally accepted
customs and receive a parent's blessing
at the nuptials.
After many weeks of delay and investi
gation, both public and private, the Board
of Police Commissioners finally decided
yesterday to make no exceptions to their
order made seme weeks ag-o to close all
side entrances to saloons and compel hold
ers of liquor licenses to cut down the par
titions In their saloons to a height of six
feet.
Since the order was first Issued the en
tire Influence cf the saloon faction has
been directed on the Commissioners with
a view to havlns the order rescinded, or
at least modified to the extent o* making
exceptions !n ?. few cases of downtown
places that h3vo been in business for
many years. It was particularly sought
to make exceptions of the Hoffman Cafe,
Goodfellows" CJrotto and the Odeon. Night
after night the proprietors of these places
have appeared before the Commissioners,
backed by legal tnlent, ana argued to have
the order modified, claiming: that 'their
places are restaurants aa ; much as the
many so-called French restaurants In the
city.
The Commissioners were in session over
three, hours yesterday before they took
the final vote that settled the whole.mat
ter. During: the session they heard more
arguments and looked over petitions with
out number, but they refused to recede
from their position. A general order was
Issued to captains and lieutenants to no
tify all saloon men that the order will be
enforced to the" letter, in accordance with
order 2636 of the Board of Supervisors.
All who fall to comply with the order will
be refused renewals of their licenses
when they again come before the Com
missioners.
