ST. LOUIS, June 13.â By a practically
unanimous vote the striking street rail
way union men decided to-day to accept
the new proposition presented by their
executive committee and to empower the
executive committee to settle on the basis
of the clause regarding reinstatement
without reference to the union.
This action Was brought about through
the Influence of Samuel Gompers, presi
dent . of the American Federation of
Labor, who arrived In St. Louis last night
and was present at the mass-meeting
which was held at the West End Coliseum
this morning.
A new plan of settlement is. therefore,
now In the hands of the executive com
mittee. It varies but little Irons the pre
vious proposition, except In the paragraph
which provides for the reinstatement t
the men. The paragraph leaves the ex
ecutive board free to negotiate with the
Traction Company and secure the best
terms possible, or to arrange for an ar
bitration of the question. It Is no longer
demanded that all the strikers shall be
taken back.
At 4:30 o'clock the new proposition was
presented to Judge Henry S. Priest, at
torney of the Transit Company, who took
the matter under advisement and said the
company would return Its answer to-mor
row. The agreement Is as follows:
1â The agreement of March 10. 1900, except as
herein modified. Is re-estabUshed.
2â No discrimination will be made against
any employe because he Is or may become a
member of any union. All employes must bÂ«
entirely free to Join any organization.
3 â Any attempt on the part of an employe to
Induce any other employe by Intimidation or
threats to Join or not to Join any union will ba
cause for the Immediate discharge of the per
son guilty of such attempt.
4 â Any attempt to Influence any employe by
any official of the company to Join or not to
Join Any union shall be cause for discharga of
said official.
5 â The company wilt treat with any commit
tee representing the organization regarding any
matter of mutual Interest.
6â The company will agree that If any future
differences arise between It and Its employes
with respect to the terms of this agreement,
or Its application to cases' that shall hereafter
arise which cannot be adjusted amicably be
tween . the parties, they shall be submitted to
arbitration.
7â The question of reinstatement of former
employes shall be submitted to arbitration.
Later in the day the following addition
was made:

LAST LETTER WRITTEN
BY EDNA G. TERRY
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. June 15.â Mrs. Alderman of
Hyde Park to-day received a letter which
â¢vras written and posted two months ago
by Dr. Edna G. Terry, who was recently
murdered by the . Boxers. This was "pos
sibly her last letter. It was in part as
follows:
TSUN HUA. China, April 5.â School had to
close Â¦ earlier on account of the' new building
and Miss Crourher has srane to the seashore..
She will ' be all alone there for some time. I
hear she has taken a teacher and will Im
prove, her time in i way that will count in
the work hereafter. It seems a little strange
that none of the North China workers are- at
all anxious to go home. . Each thinks the other
ought to go. I should like to stay a year or
two longer, but on account of the vacation time
of the others in this station it seem* desirable
all around for me to go while Dr. Hopkins Is
still here. So I have yielded to the best Judg
ment of the entire mission and will maka
plans to leave -tare some" -time in June.
cannot yet tell the date. I am hoping to have
company and am â¢ waiting ( to know the plans
of. some others who are going. '
Â¦> NEW YORK, June 15.â A cablegram re
ceived here to-day announces, that there
lsia chance that Dr. Terry may have
escaped the massacre.'
forcements will be determined and the
foreign powers will be advised of the
President's purpose. Neither Japan nor
Russia requested the consent of this Gov
ernment before ordering their soldiers to
Peking, though from what can be gath
ered their action was taken with the con
sent of all the European powers. Both
the Tokio and St. Petersburg Governments
have Informed Secretary Hay that troops
have been sent to Peking, and hope is ex
pressed that their appearance in China
will make the Chinese understand the
seriousness of their acts and cause them
to return to avocations of peace.
It developed to-day that France Is play
ing the role cf pacificator In the present
trouble. She has dene much to bring about
concert of action on the part of the Celes
tial empire, and. not being Involved in a
political campaign, she Is free to act In
such a manner as may best produce a
harmonious solution of the present diffi
culty. She is certainly not assisting Rus
sia, it is stated on authority, but is pur
suing a policy Intended to harmonize the
conflicting interests of the several nations.
It Is recognized, however,, that the pres
ence of foreign troops in the same neign
borhood may result in a clash which will
precipitate war.' and the attitude of
France, in case Russia is involved, may
then change.
Vice Admiral Seymour, commanding the
International force now on its way to
Peking, cabled his Government, and It re
peated the dispatch to Lord Pauncefote
here, that great difficulty is being experi
enced in securing water for the use of the
troops. The International force Is now
at a considerable distance from Pel Ho
River, and their commander apparently
fears to permit men to drink water drawn
from native wells because of danger that
it might be poisoned. Vice Admiral Sey
mour states that the force Is twenty-flve
miles from Peking, having covered only
three miles in the past twenty-four hours.
The obstacles encountered are mainly in
the form of tracks destroyed by the Box
ers, and he deems reinforcements neces
sary in order that he may be prepared to
meet every contingency, though he be
lieves the trouble will be less difficult to
deal with than has been expected.
WASHINGTON. June -15.â Nothing has come to the State Department
from United States Minister Conger at Peking since last Tuesday even
ing, and the officials have settled to the belief that not until the for
eign relief column reaches the Chinese capital will Mr. Conger be able
to resume the use of the cable. It is ominous that nothing has been
heard from the United States Consul at Chin Klang sir.ee his first appeal for the
sending of a warship to that point, and it may he that he, too, has been Isolated.
The Consul at Chefu is in a better position, for a cablegram received at the
Navy Department to-day announces the arrival of the gunboat Torktown at that
port. The vessel probably will He at Chefu awaiting orders. She is within a
day's sail of Taku. and can be summoned by Admiral Kempff if he needs rein
forcements at short notice. It is probable, however, that the Yorktown will
serve a better purpose by remaining in the vicinity of Chefu. as the Boxers
are reported to be active In that section of Shantung.
Admiral Remey cabled to the Navy Department this morning as follows:
CAVITE, June 15.â At KempfTn request. I shall send the Iris about the 20th with coal
and stores for nine hundred men for three months. " REMET.
The Iris Is a big collier and distilling ship. Nine hundred men mentioned In
the cablegram make up the personnel o*f the flagship Newark, the Monocacy. now
on the way to Taku, and the Yorktown at Chefu. with the marine contingent
ashore in China.
The significant feature of the message Is the Indicated opinion of Admiral
KempfT that the disturbances in China may be expected to last several months
at least.
That the crisis fs by no means past, but. on the contrary. Is rather more
acute. 13 evidenced by the cablegram received by the State Department this
morning from the I'nited States Consul at Tientsin. Mr. Ragsdale. He says
that the mobs? are In control of the native city of Tientsin, and that the au
thorities do not seem to be able to do anything with them. He adds that the
foreigners in Tientsin are still safe. The surprising feature of this telegram is tho
announcement that the Boxers are operating freely under the very guns of the
men-of-war; for it. is understood that several Russian Kunboats are lying oft Tien
tsin, v.hich Is also the depot of the relief column. Fortunately, the Nashville
and the Monocacy are Just about due at Taku, and one or both of these vessels
will soon be able to command the situation at Tientsin.
"The records of the War Department show that there are now In the city of
Manila and vicinity the Fourteenth and Twentieth Infantry and one battery each
of the Third. Fourth. Fifth and Sixth Artilleryâ less than SOOO soldiers altogether.
There are, however, no lÂ«ss than 57.000 soldiers distributed , among the various
comiruinds otitsMe' df Manila, and some of these would 'certainly be called upon
to furnish garrisons forthe city In case troops should be sent to China.
Official dispatches received in diplomatic quarters to-day are far from reas
suring as regardB the progress of the expeditionary force toward Peking. One
of the official dispatches said that great difficulty was experienced in securing
sufficient water for the pressing needs of the International party. There are no
running streams near the present locality of the troops and it 13 supposed that
the native wells cannot be relied upon in the existing drought and In the present
intensity of anti-foreign sentiment. ; . ,

city officials have been burned .at the stake. The foreign settlement Is ex
pecting an immediate attack. ' ,
' SHANGHAI, June 15.â News of the safety of all forejgn Ministers in
Peking was received here to-day. None have been murdered. The legations
axe barricaded and foreigners within will thus be able to resist attack by
mobs. If. however. Chinese soldiers should storm the barricade the diplo
mats and refugees would be powerless and many lives might be sacrificed.
Blx warships are here. The natives are agitated, but the police are unu
sually watchful and no outbreak has yet occurred.
LONDON*. June 1Câ This is the situation in China as it appears to the Shang
hai correspondent of the Daily Express,, cabling last evening:
"It is really a state of veiled war. The members of the foreign lega
tions in Pekins: are virtually prisoners and the Chinese troops are
restrained from attacking them only by fear of the lega
tion guards. Meanwhile the Ministers are altogether unable to com
municate with the commanders of the relief column, which is making an en
forced and isolated halt between Tientsin and Peking. The walls of the capital
are guarded by 100.000 Imperial- troops. The prates are heavily defended with
modern guns. General Tung, acting under orders from the Empress Dowager,
Bays that no more foreign troops have entered or shall enter the sacred city.
"On Monday the Ministers sent a demand to the Tsung-11 Yamen that the
grates be opened, declaring that otherwise the foreign troops would enter
forcibly. To this no reply was given. A second message went unanswered, or
had not been answered when the latest news left Peking.
"Sir Claude Macdonald's latest message says that the legations are capable
of sustaining an effective defense unless attacked in force."
Russia, this correspondent asserts, notwithstanding assurances to the con
trary. Fides with China. Some of the foreign troops are already reported to be
In the environs of Peking and the attitude of the Chinese troops is Increasingly
menacing.
"The streets of Peking." continues the correspondent of the Daily Express,
"are reported to be seething with anti-foreign mebs. clamoring for the destruc
tion cf the legations and the death of the foreign Ministers. Even were the
Tsung-ll Yamcn disposed to restrain the violence of the reactionaries. It Is
highly improbable that they would be able to hold them in check. For the for
eiirn Ministers the crisis will arise when the relief column comes in sight of
Peking. It Is still felt here that the foreign force Is wholly. Inadequate to battle
with the hordes of Chinese troops massed outside the gates, which now Include
the Imperial troops from Shan-Hai-Kwan."
A disquieting element In the situation is the fact that although the Russo-
Chlnese telegraph line from Peking, via Kiakhta (Eastern Siberia), is working,
the transmission of messages is rigidly refused.
From Tientsin it is reported that the foreign forces In the harbor will at
tack the Taku forts and if necessary bombard them".'
The International column appears to be still at Lang Fan, engaged in-slowly
repairing the railway, â¢which, acordincg to a dispatch from Tientsin to the Daily
Mail, dated June 14, cannot be effected for weeks. The forqe is short of pro
visions and as It is without field transport it must stick to the railway.
The report that the mixed forces will seize the Taku forts is taken to mean
that the foreign commanders expect no aid from the Chinese Government In re
pressing the disorders and are determined to make Taku secure as a base from
which to operate. - ' " i:'",~- ?Â¦ : ;. : ."
The Deutsche Tages Zeitung and other papers advocate Germany's co-opera
tion with Russia and France in China. The Lokal Anzelger prints a specl.nl
dispatch from St. Petersburg saying that an Important Russian dignitary will
Eoon leave for Berlin to effect an understanding with Germany for a Joint so
lution â¢with France of the present troubles.
ENGLISHMAN ATTACKED BY FRENCH.
The papers view the situation gloomily, pointing out particularly the want of
harmony among the International troops. The Vosslsche Zeitung says: "The
hop* of harmonious procedure Is fast vanishing as the separate ambition's appear
on the surface. Probably It will n^ed a few more reverses before the powers
Â»re cemented for the purpose of joint action." ' . ; *\",
"Our forces include three large cruisers, the Hansa, Hertha and Ka!serin Au
gusta; the small cruisers Gefion and Irene and the gunboats Iltls and Jaguar,
with their crews, aggregating 2227 men. Then there are our forces at Klaochau,
2290. These S4T2 are ail trained men, of whom 2000 may be Epared if required for
action ashore."
dispatches from China, and their non-appearance Is interpreted to mean the ex
istence of alarming conditions. Doubts are expressed, however, as to the accuracy
of the latest alleged news from Peking, because of the fact that telegraphic com
munication with the Chinese capital has not been re-established. The correspond
ent of the Associated Press to-day obtained from a leading Foreign Office official
the following statement as to German forces in China. The official said:
BERLIN. June IS.â The German Foreign Office has not yet received expected
GERMANY'S FORCE IN CHINA.
"For some days the French and Russian authorities have been jealous be
cause of the supposed facilities given the British authorities by the British em
ployes of the China railways. Yesterday (Wednesday) some French marines at
tempted to take charge of an engine required at the front. Locomotive Inspector
Weir refused to give up the engine, and a Frenchman attempted to bayonet him.
Weir caught the muzzle of the rifle and the bayonet passed over his shoulder.
For a moment serious trouble between the British and French was Imminent, but
the prompt action of the British consular and naval officers, backed by the
American Consul and the railway officials, prevented a collision. Conciliatory
expressions -were exchanged. The French Consul withdrew his opposition and the
British remained In charge of the engine as before."
LONDON, June 15.â An Incident has already .occurred Involving the British
and French at Tientsin, which nearly ended in violence. A dispatch from Tien
tsin, dated yesterday, says:
FRENCH CABINET CONSIDERS SITUATION.
The French Consul at Tientsin. M. Declasse announced, had telegraphed that
all was quiet within the French concession there, which was guarded by French
end Russian troops.
Finally, M. Delcasse said, a swift first-class cruiser had been ordered to pro
ceed to Taku to reinforce the French naval division at that place.
PARIS. June 15.â At a Cabinet council to-day the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
M. Declasse, announced that the telegraph line to Peking had again been cut.
The latest dispatch from the French Minister there, he added, was dated on the
evening of June 12, and said that the Chinese Government had informed him
that It would not oppose the foreign detachments entering Peking.
KWANG SU'S RESTORATION FAVORED.
IX)NT>ON. June 16, 4:20 a. m.â The Hongkong correspondent of the Times, un
der yesterday's date, says: "The southern provinces of China are still quiet, al
though there was a slight disturbance recently against the Catholics in the vil
lage of Tai-Ix?k. near Fat-Shan. There are some misgivings at the idea that the
military authorities arc about to cause a further' depletion of the Hongkong gar
rison."
QUIET IN SOUTHERN C^INA.
- LONDON', June 13.â A special dispatch from Shanghai dated to-day says: A
report has reached here that the British, American and Japanese Ministers In Pe
king favor the restoration of Emperor Kwang Su. but that' the French and
T^sslan Ministers insist upon the powers taking charge of China. It is fur
ther reported that the respective divisions of the country have already been
assigned.' The belief is that the withdrawal of the British ships from the
Yang-tse-Kiang Is an Indication of Great Britain's disclaimer in the sphere
theory. â¢-
HONGKONG. June 13.â The departure for Taku of the hired transport Hlng
Bang has been delayed, owing to the time, taken in fitting her up." But she em

which will embark on the cruiser Terrible to-morrow. Â¦ â¢-â¢ Â¦*', . ...
TRANSPORT'S DEPARTURE DELAYED.
ALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON; HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 15.â
fiL-Â«^ American troops in Luzon may Â» be ; drawn upon to furnish reinforcements for Admiral
Kempff in China. What, action will be taken -will, depend upon the views of Minister Conger
and Admiral KempfT, orjsither. After the meeting of the Cabinet to-day, cablegrams were sent to
these officials asking them to immediately wire to Washington -they deemed it advisable
for. an additional force to be landed for the purpose of assisting the international troops in ; reach
ing Peking and for the protection of the American Legation and the. line * of communication be

past forty-eight hours, and as the other; governments are likewise information as to ; the
occurrences in the Chinese capital during a similar, period, it -is not 'certain that the message sent
by Secretary- Hay to Minister Conger will reach its destination. Admiral. Kempff 's reply, how
ever, will be regarded as determining the question.- .
: The decision toj send soldiers, if; they are needed, was reached /only after most careful delib
eration. The President and his Cabinet have beenayerse from the start to the proposition to order
troops from Luzon, believing that it was in' the interest of the integrity of A China to confine the
force landed to marines and ' sailors. ' During the - meeting of the' Cabinet to-day Rear '. Admiral A.

the cablegram make up the personnel o*f the flagship Newark, the Monocacy. now
on the way to Taku, and the Yorktown at Chefu. with the marine contingent
ashore in China.
The significant feature of the message Is the Indicated opinion of Admiral
KempfT that the disturbances in China may be expected to last several months
at least.
That the crisis fs by no means past, but. on the contrary. Is rather more
acute. 13 evidenced by the cablegram received by the State Department this
morning from the I'nited States Consul at Tientsin. Mr. Ragsdale. He says
that the mobs? are In control of the native city of Tientsin, and that the au
thorities do not seem to be able to do anything with them. He adds that the
foreigners in Tientsin are still safe. The surprising feature of this telegram is tho
announcement that the Boxers are operating freely under the very guns of the
men-of-war; for it. is understood that several Russian Kunboats are lying oft Tien
tsin, v.hich Is also the depot of the relief column. Fortunately, the Nashville
and the Monocacy are Just about due at Taku, and one or both of these vessels
will soon be able to command the situation at Tientsin.
"The records of the War Department show that there are now In the city of
Manila and vicinity the Fourteenth and Twentieth Infantry and one battery each
of the Third. Fourth. Fifth and Sixth Artilleryâ less than SOOO soldiers altogether.
There are, however, no lÂ«ss than 57.000 soldiers distributed , among the various
comiruinds otitsMe' df Manila, and some of these would 'certainly be called upon
to furnish garrisons forthe city In case troops should be sent to China.
Official dispatches received in diplomatic quarters to-day are far from reas
suring as regardB the progress of the expeditionary force toward Peking. One
of the official dispatches said that great difficulty was experienced in securing
sufficient water for the pressing needs of the International party. There are no
running streams near the present locality of the troops and it 13 supposed that
the native wells cannot be relied upon in the existing drought and In the present
intensity of anti-foreign sentiment. ; . ,

Peking was received here to-day. None have been murdered. The legations

Blx warships are here. The natives are agitated, but the police are unu
sually watchful and no outbreak has yet occurred.
LONDON*. June 1Câ This is the situation in China as it appears to the Shang
hai correspondent of the Daily Express,, cabling last evening:
"It is really a state of veiled war. The members of the foreign lega
tions in Pekins: are virtually prisoners and the Chinese troops are
restrained from attacking them only by fear of the lega
tion guards. Meanwhile the Ministers are altogether unable to com
municate with the commanders of the relief column, which is making an en
forced and isolated halt between Tientsin and Peking. The walls of the capital
are guarded by 100.000 Imperial- troops. The prates are heavily defended with
modern guns. General Tung, acting under orders from the Empress Dowager,
Bays that no more foreign troops have entered or shall enter the sacred city.
"On Monday the Ministers sent a demand to the Tsung-11 Yamen that the
grates be opened, declaring that otherwise the foreign troops would enter
forcibly. To this no reply was given. A second message went unanswered, or
had not been answered when the latest news left Peking.
"Sir Claude Macdonald's latest message says that the legations are capable
of sustaining an effective defense unless attacked in force."
Russia, this correspondent asserts, notwithstanding assurances to the con
trary. Fides with China. Some of the foreign troops are already reported to be
In the environs of Peking and the attitude of the Chinese troops is Increasingly
menacing.
"The streets of Peking." continues the correspondent of the Daily Express,
"are reported to be seething with anti-foreign mebs. clamoring for the destruc
tion cf the legations and the death of the foreign Ministers. Even were the
Tsung-ll Yamcn disposed to restrain the violence of the reactionaries. It Is
highly improbable that they would be able to hold them in check. For the for
eiirn Ministers the crisis will arise when the relief column comes in sight of
Peking. It Is still felt here that the foreign force Is wholly. Inadequate to battle
with the hordes of Chinese troops massed outside the gates, which now Include
the Imperial troops from Shan-Hai-Kwan."
A disquieting element In the situation is the fact that although the Russo-
Chlnese telegraph line from Peking, via Kiakhta (Eastern Siberia), is working,
the transmission of messages is rigidly refused.
From Tientsin it is reported that the foreign forces In the harbor will at
tack the Taku forts and if necessary bombard them".'
The International column appears to be still at Lang Fan, engaged in-slowly
repairing the railway, â¢which, acordincg to a dispatch from Tientsin to the Daily
Mail, dated June 14, cannot be effected for weeks. The forqe is short of pro
visions and as It is without field transport it must stick to the railway.
The report that the mixed forces will seize the Taku forts is taken to mean
that the foreign commanders expect no aid from the Chinese Government In re
pressing the disorders and are determined to make Taku secure as a base from
which to operate. - ' " i:'",~- ?Â¦ : ;. : ."
The Deutsche Tages Zeitung and other papers advocate Germany's co-opera
tion with Russia and France in China. The Lokal Anzelger prints a specl.nl
dispatch from St. Petersburg saying that an Important Russian dignitary will
Eoon leave for Berlin to effect an understanding with Germany for a Joint so
lution â¢with France of the present troubles.
ENGLISHMAN ATTACKED BY FRENCH.
The papers view the situation gloomily, pointing out particularly the want of
harmony among the International troops. The Vosslsche Zeitung says: "The
hop* of harmonious procedure Is fast vanishing as the separate ambition's appear
on the surface. Probably It will n^ed a few more reverses before the powers
Â»re cemented for the purpose of joint action." ' . ; *\",
"Our forces include three large cruisers, the Hansa, Hertha and Ka!serin Au
gusta; the small cruisers Gefion and Irene and the gunboats Iltls and Jaguar,
with their crews, aggregating 2227 men. Then there are our forces at Klaochau,
2290. These S4T2 are ail trained men, of whom 2000 may be Epared if required for
action ashore."
dispatches from China, and their non-appearance Is interpreted to mean the ex
istence of alarming conditions. Doubts are expressed, however, as to the accuracy
of the latest alleged news from Peking, because of the fact that telegraphic com
munication with the Chinese capital has not been re-established. The correspond
ent of the Associated Press to-day obtained from a leading Foreign Office official
the following statement as to German forces in China. The official said:
BERLIN. June IS.â The German Foreign Office has not yet received expected
GERMANY'S FORCE IN CHINA.
"For some days the French and Russian authorities have been jealous be
cause of the supposed facilities given the British authorities by the British em
ployes of the China railways. Yesterday (Wednesday) some French marines at
tempted to take charge of an engine required at the front. Locomotive Inspector
Weir refused to give up the engine, and a Frenchman attempted to bayonet him.
Weir caught the muzzle of the rifle and the bayonet passed over his shoulder.
For a moment serious trouble between the British and French was Imminent, but
the prompt action of the British consular and naval officers, backed by the
American Consul and the railway officials, prevented a collision. Conciliatory
expressions -were exchanged. The French Consul withdrew his opposition and the
British remained In charge of the engine as before."
LONDON, June 15.â An Incident has already .occurred Involving the British
and French at Tientsin, which nearly ended in violence. A dispatch from Tien
tsin, dated yesterday, says:
FRENCH CABINET CONSIDERS SITUATION.
The French Consul at Tientsin. M. Declasse announced, had telegraphed that
all was quiet within the French concession there, which was guarded by French
end Russian troops.
Finally, M. Delcasse said, a swift first-class cruiser had been ordered to pro
ceed to Taku to reinforce the French naval division at that place.
PARIS. June 15.â At a Cabinet council to-day the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
M. Declasse, announced that the telegraph line to Peking had again been cut.
The latest dispatch from the French Minister there, he added, was dated on the
evening of June 12, and said that the Chinese Government had informed him
that It would not oppose the foreign detachments entering Peking.
KWANG SU'S RESTORATION FAVORED.
IX)NT>ON. June 16, 4:20 a. m.â The Hongkong correspondent of the Times, un
der yesterday's date, says: "The southern provinces of China are still quiet, al
though there was a slight disturbance recently against the Catholics in the vil
lage of Tai-Ix?k. near Fat-Shan. There are some misgivings at the idea that the
military authorities arc about to cause a further' depletion of the Hongkong gar

king favor the restoration of Emperor Kwang Su. but that' the French and
T^sslan Ministers insist upon the powers taking charge of China. It is fur

ALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON; HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 15.â
fiL-Â«^ American troops in Luzon may Â» be ; drawn upon to furnish reinforcements for Admiral
Kempff in China. What, action will be taken -will, depend upon the views of Minister Conger
and Admiral KempfT, orjsither. After the meeting of the Cabinet to-day, cablegrams were sent to
these officials asking them to immediately wire to Washington -they deemed it advisable
for. an additional force to be landed for the purpose of assisting the international troops in ; reach
ing Peking and for the protection of the American Legation and the. line * of communication be

occurrences in the Chinese capital during a similar, period, it -is not 'certain that the message sent
by Secretary- Hay to Minister Conger will reach its destination. Admiral. Kempff 's reply, how
ever, will be regarded as determining the question.- .
: The decision toj send soldiers, if; they are needed, was reached /only after most careful delib
eration. The President and his Cabinet have beenayerse from the start to the proposition to order
troops from Luzon, believing that it was in' the interest of the integrity of A China to confine the

ABDUCTION OF "GYP"
WAS ONLY A JOKE
Parisian Eccentric Confesses That He
and Four Companions Were
the Culprits*
PARIS, June 16.â The mystery of the
abduction of "Gyp," Countess de Martel
de Janville. is at last cleared. .Le Matin
publishes this morning a full confession of
the chief perpetrator, who is an artist
named Karl, a character of the Latin
Quartier and famous for his practical
jokea. He Is was who hoaxed M.
Quesnay de Beaurepalre at the time of the
Drevfus trial by making him believe that
he (Karl) was in possession of conclusive
proof of the guilt of the accused. M. de
Beaurepaire for a time made great capital
of the communication, whereupon Karl,
to the immense amusement of the Paris
ians, announced that It was all a prac
tical joke.
Karl now explains that the Idea of ab
ducting "Gyp" occurred to him one day
while in the I^ouvre and looking at a
painting representing the abduction of the
Sabines. He carried out the plan, with the
assistance of four jovial companions, and
left the Comtesse imprisoned in a small
villa on the left bank of the Seine, be
tween Charenton and St. Maurice.
He expressed astonishment that the
Comtesse did not reveal the identity of
her abductors, for. to quiet her. he intro
duced himself and friends before leaving
her for the night. HÂ«* declines to give the
real object of the "Joke." inasmuch as It
failed owing to the agility of the Com
tesse.
SUBMARINE BOATS TO BE

Besults of the Work, Together With
Photographs by Scientists From
Smithsonian Institution,
Highly Successful
WASHINGTON, June 15.â A preliminary
cccount of ihe. observations made at
Wadesboro. N. 'C. during the recent
eclipse undfr the direction of the Smith-
Bonian Institution has been prepared by
C. G. Abbott of the institution. He says:
Tho main object of investigation was the
corona, and at thlc. first, a photographic rtudy
of the drtail*-d Ktructur^ of the inner corona,
with. fÂ»con4, a determination by the bolometer
whether aii-retiable heat reaches us from it,
and, if pcsMble. an examination of the form of
its fi*-etrum energy curve.
The- eclir>sÂ« was notably not a dark one. No
eeconfi mapnituae stars were observed with the
r.-i.'-'i eye. ilest of the observers saw only
Mercury, though Venui was distinguished by
tome, fkimming through the trees, and Cappella
airo was s*-f:n by a few. The 'high degree of
illumination operated unfavorably in the etudy
of tfae outer corona.
The fall of temperature and rteSng breeze
were distinctly noticeable before totality. No ;
char.pe In direction of the wind was noted,
fchadow â¢ banris mere seen, but those observers
who attempted to measure their velocity found
them too iariÂ«l and flickering for any eucceasr
ful work in this direction, yet there was nota*

RAIN INJURES CROPS.
Unexpected Showers Do Damage in
Many Sections.
RED' BLUFF, June 15.â The heaviest
thunder-storm experienced for a long
time visited this section this afternoon.
It will probably do some slight damage to
grain, as hvvesting is just beginning and
it will probably blow down some wheat.
It will also do some damage to the fruit
crop, which is very heavy. Most of thÂ«>
farmers have their hay either under
cover or in stacks.' The rain -commenced
at 2 o'clock and at 5 o'clock about half an
inch had fallen.
REDDING, June 15.â Rain began falling
here at 11:30 o'clock and a sharp down
pour continued all this afternoon with
out Intermission. The storm was accom
panied by the heaviest thunder heard
here in several years, peal after peal be

were obtained, the last being about forty
seconds before totality. Then the dia
phragm was opened to five hundred times
its former dimensions, and a negative de
flection of 13 mm. was observed after to
tality, where these positive deflections had
just been found, showing that the corona
was actually cooler than the grain card,
which had been used at the room tempera
ture. Next the black surface of the moon
was allowed to radiate upon the bolo
meter, and the still larger negative de
flection of 1 mm. was observed. The Im
portant result was that the corona gave
a positive indication of heat as compared
with the moon. This heat, though cer
tain, was. however, too slight to be sub
divided by the dispersion of the prism
with the means at hand.
The negatives taken to depict the outer
corona show from three to four solar
diametprs' extension the longest stream
ers. The equatorial wings assume
more 'and more hairlike proportions as
they recede from the sun, and are finally
lost in an equally illuminated gky without
having given any indication of actually
coming to an end.
No attempt to clearly examine the
plates taken for Intramercurial planets
has yet been possible. It is. however,
doubtful If any very faint objects will be
ffcund in consideration of the considerable
Pky illumination during totality. However,
Pleone and many faint stars in the
Pleiades were plainly seen on one of the
plates.
On the whole, the expedition may fairly
be considered as very satisfactory in its
results.

the objection of. the Dupont-HIggins peo
ple to Mr. Addicks and said that opposi
tion to no one man could be allowed to
stand in the way of party success in Dela
ware or elsewhere.. . * :
"I am satisfied," he continued, "that I
reflect the sentiment of the President in
my appeal to secure a ssttlement of the
case, and this cause is one that appeals to
the common sense of every man here. We
must put aside personalities, rise above
petty prejudices and take our stand on
the broader plane of patriotism and party
success. The committee cannot afford to
ta*ke up the personal cause of any set of
men; much less can it afford to espouse
the cause of any individual." x
Continuing, he said that contingencies
might possibly arise in .which Delaware
would settle a national contest, and it was
especially important that the possible ef
fect upon the United Sta.tes Senate should
be borne in mind. True, there was a safe
Republican majority in the Senate at
present, but no one could tell what emer
gency might arise or what chajiges might
occur.
Concluding, Senator Hanna said: "I
feel an intense interest in this case be
cause of its possible bearing upon national
politics, ana I appeal to youâ Indeed, I
supplicate the Delaware Republicans of
both parties â to forget that there has ever
been a factional flgnt in the party in your
State, and to unite in the interest of the
common cause; ejid it will not do to for
get that the responsibility for any mis
take that is made will be fastened upon
those who made it."
The Senator's utterances were liberally
applauded by members of the committee,
and when he concluded there was no op
position to the recommittal of the ques
tion.
The action of the committee in the vari
ous contests has caused it to be generally
remarked that it has not been Influenced
in the least by the leaders. Senator Han
na's friends from the South, especially
the office holders ha-ve received scant
consideration. Where there were rival
factions of office holders, as in Alabama,
both sides have been denied seats.. The
defeat of Wlmberley In Louisiana and the
elevation of Warmouth is said to have
been distinctly antagonistic to the wishes
of the close friends of the administration,
as Wlmberley was sustained by the ad
ministration in the tight that was made
against his confirmation when he was ap
pointed Collector of the Port of New Or
leans. It was in opposition to this con
firmation that Warmouth took occasion to
make some bitter remarks about Senator
Hanna, who was supporting Wimberley.
In the New York case It is asserted that
the decision was against Senator Platt.
and other cases are instanced by the mem
bers of the committee as examples of in
dependent action.
The evening session was devoted to the
hearing of arguments In the contests from
Texas. There were seven cases from that
State, including two delegates from the
State at large and the first, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth. Seventh and Ninth districts.
In a general way the controversy was
over the question of the selection of a
member of the national committee. This
position is now occupied by John Grant,
while E. H. R. Green and Representative
Hawley are both credited with aspirations
to fill the office. Technically the First in
volved the regularity of the various con
ventions. State and district. In the case
of the State convention both sides claim
resrularity.
Both conventions chose Mr. Green and
Mr. Hawley as delegates, so there is no
contest on them, but the Green conven
tion named in addition William H. Mc-
Donald and W. M. Rogers^, while the other
convention named Â¦ C. M.- Ferguson and
George B. Jackson. These -last named
pairs were pitted against .each other.
The hearing was begun on the First Dis
trict. With but little discussion Walter
T. Burns and John Atkins, Hawley dele
gates, were seated. The Fourth and Fifth
districts were passed. When -the Sixth
District was taken up it was decided that
neither delegation should bfe represented
on the temporary roll. C. A. Boynton and
J. H. Chllds, Hawley delegates, were
seated from the Seventh District. The
committee then adjourned until 11 o'clock
to-morrow.
PHILADELPHIA, June 15.-Specula
tlon. gossip and informal confer
ences to-day among National Com
mitteemen and other leading Re
publicans who are here has failed
to indicate a crystallization of sentiment
erour.d any individual as regards the Vice
I'rrsidency. Neither Senator Hanna nor
those who are close to him give any inti
mation that the administration has a
choice. The number of delegates who will
vote tor any man that the administration
favors seems to accentuate the general
impression that the nominee will be the
uian rr.ori satisfactory to the President.
TTli you would take us into your confi
dence on this matter it would simplify
the matter greatly and give us an oppor
tunity to <io what the President would
like," said a prominent Republican to
Senator Hanna to-day; and the reply he
made was:
"You know all that I know about it."
Senator Hanna's oniy observation on the
situation to-day was that until the dif
ferent delegations arrived and there was
an opportunity for them to consult no
conclusion could be reached. ;- ; 'i ' v Jw ; "'
Senator Plaits talk or Udell of New
York caused a little flutter here, and Dol
liver stock took au upward turn about the
eaiie time, the cause bting the Impres
sion that in case Odell should be pressed
hy New York there would be a concen
tration on the Iowa Congressman by
those who do not favor the New Yorker.
The candidacy ol Lieutenant Governor
Woodruff of New York, who arrived to-
Oay. is still being kt-pt in evidence by his
Iriends; but apparently without any back
ing iron the Republican managers and
with the distinct disapproval of Senator
Hanna.
When questioned to-night regarding the
etaiement made by Senator Hanna to the
effect that Mr. Woodruff was not a satis
factory candidate lor the Vice Presidency,
the latter said: . â¢- ,
â¢Had i any intimation from the admin
istration tha.t my candidacy was not de
sirable I would not have allowed my
Iriends to support to the extent they
have."
New York for Woodruff.
Mr. WoodrufT was asked If he would
continue a candidate in the event of the
New York delegation failing to support
him. To this he replied: "There will be
no such event."
The position of Secretary Long causes
considerable comment axia it is being
fretiy asked why the Long candidacy
thouid proceed so far unless it has the tacit
consent of the President. The fact that
Long is a member of McKinley's Cabinet
jpives rise to an undeniably widespread
belief that the Secretary of the Navy will
iinally receive the support of the adminis
tration. If. such is the case, however, it
is being carefully kept from view. As the
matter stands to-nignt it would seem that
J>o:ig Dollivrr and Fairbanks are the
leading possibilities for Vice President.
Delegate Payne of the Iowa delegation
arrived lo-day. having come via Wash
ington. He brought renewed assurances
lrom Senator Allison that he could not
and would not be a candidate for Vice
President. Mr. Payne stated that Mr. Al
lison told him that he not only would not
he a candidate, but that if nominated he
would decline.
"if they should place me in nomina
tion," the Senator is quoted as having
said. "1 will decline and 1 will find means
ol letting the delegates know my position
before they leave the halL" ' t '
Smator 1'airbanks was another arrival
to-day and has been besieged by those
who .were â¢ anxious to know if he was a
candidate for Vice President. While he
would not be Interviewed, he did deny any
aspirations for the office. The position of
Senator Fairbanks. however, is well
known. He does not want the Vice Pres
idency. He likes a Senatorial career and
has every prospect of remaining in the
Senate as long as his party remains in
power in Indiana. However, there are a
number of Republican leaders who think
5t possible that a contingency may arise
where it will be necessary to nominate

formal Conferences at Philadelphia

Senator Fairbanks. In such an event It
is believed bv those who know the Sena
tor's party loyalty that he would accept.
It has been suggested that he will make
the speech placing MeKJnley in nomina
tion, but so far no such arrangement has
bten made.
Bartlett Tripp Mentioned.
Thp fact that the name cf Bartlett Tripp
will be presented to the convention for
Vice President is not allowed to be hidden
hy the energetic men of the Pacific Coast
who .ire in charge of his interests. Just
now they consist of National Committee
men Ashton of Washington and Stoele of
Oregon. They will be reinforced to-mor
row when the delegations from Oregon
and Washington arrive.
Mr. Ashton had an interview with Sen
ator Hanna to-day and told him that the
nomination of Tripp would mean the re
tention of a million and a half of voters
known as gold standard Democrats, who
would appreciate the compliment paid to
them by nominating a former stanch
Cleveland Democrat, although he has left
the party and joined the Republicans on
the money and expansion issues.
Mr. Ashton says that Judge Tripp will
be backed by many other Western States
besides Oregon and Washington.
HANNA APPEALS FOR
REPUBLICAN HARMONY
National Committee Decides All Con
tests but That From Del
aware.
PHILADELPHIA. June 15.â The Repub
lican National Committee to-day put in
three long sessions on the contests which
have been brought before It and adjourned
late to-night with the controversies prac
tically disposed of, except that from Dela
ware. This has been referred back to the
sub-committee with instructions to again
endeavor to bring the factions to a basis
of agreement, and will receive final action
to-morrow. An important action to-day
was the seating of the Brownlow dele
gates in the Tennessee contest and refus
ing admission to the friends of Pension
Commissioner Evans. The contest was
very bitter, and at one time there was
the possibility of a serious encounter be
tween Brownlow and Evans.
The most interesting incident of the day
was reserved until late in the afternoon.
It was a speech by Senator Hanna on the
Delaware case, in which he made an im
passioned appeal for the burial of the
hatchet between the Addicks and the Du
/ont-Higgins factions. The Delaware
controversy was brought to the front by
a report in the case made by the sub
committee appointed to make an effort to
bring the two factions to a basis of agree
ment. When this report was called for
exceptional precautions were taken to pre
vent the escape of .any word of tl}e pro
ceedings to the corridors.
Committeeman Cummings of Iowa pre
sented the report of the sub-committee.
He said that he and his colleagues had
made an earnest appeal to the leaders on
both sides to subordinate their private
interests and their prejudices to the gen
eral welfare and interests\of the party.
They had been asked, he sfeid, to unite,
each side accepting fair representation.
The Addicks people had assured him that
this arrangement would be satisfactory
to them, but the. opposing delegation had
held out for absiolute recognition, agree
ing to make proper effort to secure har
mony In State and national contests.
There was a proposition to seat the Ad
dicks delegation, but this was met with a
suggestion to recommit the matter to the
sub-committee, with instructions to make
Ftlll further effort to bring the contesting
factions together. Mn Hanna took the
floor in support of this latter proposition.
He occupied only about five minutes' time,
but he spoke with great earnestness. His
speech was an appeal for unity of action,
and he said no effort should be spared
to accomplish this end. He referred to
VICE PRESIDENTIAL PROBLEM NOT
YET SOLVED BY THE DELEGATES
KANSAS CITY, June 15.â The sub-com
mittee of the Democratic National Com
mittee appointed, to deal with the ar
rangements for the national convention
met here to-day to make final arrange
ments for the gathering and to hear re
ports of the local committees and of Col
onel John L. Martin, sergeant j at arms.
One of the most important questions con
sidered was the alleged extortionate rates
cnarged by hotel men.
Hon. James K. Jones, chairman of the
national committee, presided. The others
present Wfre J, G. Johnson of Kansas,
vice chairman of the executive commit
tee; C. A. Walsh of Iowa, secretary of
the National Commission Committee;
Messrs. D. J. Campau of Michigan. Adair
Wilson of Colorado, William J. Stone of
Missouri and John L. Martin.
After a conference with the leading ho
tel men and with the general convention
committees of Kansas City. Chairman
Jones handed the Associated Press the
following signed v statement:
The three or four leading hotels have already
contracted practically for their full capacity.
On account of the Increased expense In pre
paring for the convention the managers of
these large hotels felt themselves, compelled to
require contracts for a minimum time after
four days, the time to begin at the option of
the delegation making the contract, but they
did not Increase their, regular rate.
In the other hotels, nearly forty in number,
and the eight or ten thousand outside rooms
listed by the local committee on public com
fort, accommodations can be had at reasonable
rates and payment is only required for the
lenfjth of time the rooms are occupied.
. The local committee on public comfort has so
systematized its work that it appears to me
that it is not possible for any man to be taken
care of better and at more reasonable rates
than, haa'been the case at any former conven
tion.
The general work of the bureau of informa
tion and committee on public comfort is in
charge of A. D. L. Hamilton, New York Life
building. Kansas City, Mo., who will give all
information desired, reserve rooms and make
contracts for all persons wishing to attend the
convention. Comfortable rooms may be secured
by correspondence with him. Branch head
quarters of this bureau will be established at
all railroad stations in the city, and members
of ' the committee on public comfort, wearing
badges, will meet all incoming trains and will
also be stationed at all hotels to assist visit
ors in securing: just the kind of quarters de
aired. . JAMES. K. JONES.
Â¦ The sub-committee also carefully inves
tigated the progress being made In the
building of the Convention Hall. Some
doubt was expressed by members of the
committee that the great hall could be
completed by July 4 and there was talk
of urging the local committee to have a
nigrht shift of mechanics put to work upon
the building, but after the sub-committee
â¢ had been in conference with the local
committee and the supervising architects
they no longer doubted and accepted the
assurances that the hall will be finished
in time.
The meeting of the sub-committee was
behind closed doors. After the adjourn
ment it was stated that the only business
of public Interest transacted was the ap
portionment of tickets of admission to the
convention among the delegates and al
ternates. It was decided that each of the
030 delegates should receive besides his
own seat four tickets of admission to all
sessions of the convention, but that no
extra tickets would be given to the alter
-nated, their perquisites Delng' limited to a
scat in the .convention. .' *> r
Some of the members -favored giving
each alternate an extra ticket^ but this
proposit'on was voted -down. â¢ â¢ -~ .

London War Office Expects a Battle to Be
Fought in the fastnesses East of the
"â¢. Â¦ :'. Transvaal Capital.
LONDON, June 16, i a, m.â Lord Rob
erts' dispatches leave affairs east
. of Pretoria with the Boers with
drawn to a new position on Tues
day. News of fresh fighting is ex
pected at the War Office, but none
came last night.
General Rundle's patrol had a skirmish
with Boer videttes again Wednesday.
Some wonder is expressed here as to what
he is doing with three divisions. It is
assumed by some that General Buller will
move Into Orange River Colony and co
operate with Lord Methuen and General
Rundle in bagging President Steyn and his
7000 or SOUO followers. . . ,
Part of Christian Botha's force has halt
ed at Paardekop, eighteen miles northwest
of Volksrust. lioer parties are still near
Volksrust. and fire occasionally upon the
British pickets. . . Â¦ Â¦- Â¦ -
The British Government is considering
whether a substantial force should not be
sent to China from South Africa. It Is
thought unofficially that Lord Roberts
coula Â£pÂ£.ro a brigade or two, and the
necessary transports are now in Soutn
African waters. The commander of tne
expedition, it Is said, probably would be
General Sir William Nicholson.
A dispatch from Lourenzo Marques
dated yesterday says:. â¢'Persons. have ar
rived here who have seen the preparations
of the Boers and learned that they will
retire, .when forced, through the Lyden
berg district into the Zoutpansberg region,
adjoining Rhodesia and Gazaland." . .
The Daily Mall has a dispatch from
Bloemfontein, dated Wednesday, saying:
"GeneraUde Wet's attack on the railway
was made after he had succeeded in lur
ing General Methuen from where he had
destroyed the line. Then he cleverly
seized it north of Kroonstad, blew up the
bridge and destroyed a long section of the
lino with dynamite."
Major General Baden-Powell has been
appointed to the rank of lieutenant gen
eral.
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph, in a dispatch dated yes
terday says: "I understand that General
de Wet. in addition to the Derbyshire bat
talion, captured two companies of the
City Volunteers and two companies of
Yeomanry, two men only escaping to tell
the tale.
The Lourenzo Marques correspondent of
the Times says: "It appears that Steyn.
and not Kruger, is now the stumbling
block In the way of the surrender of the
burghers. Shortly after the British entry
into Pretoria Kruger proposed to reopen
the peace negotiations. Steyn. bearing in
mind that his former adrice was scouted,
demurred to this and pointed out that, ac
cording to the treaty between the repub
lics, neither could conclude peace without
'^Kruger. equally unwilling to Incur the
charge of a breach of faith, had to con
tinue the war. Nothing further is known
regarding the rumored peace negotiations,
but :t Is a matter of notoriety that Kru
ger favors peace on almost any terms but
dislikes personally, to take an initiative
that would involve unconditional surren
der."
Ninety-seven burghers out of 200 in one
commando have returned to their homes.
ROBERTS' DESCRIPTION OF
I DIAMOND HILL SUCCESS
LONDON, June 15.-The War Office has [
received the following dispatch from Lord j
Roberts: !
Pretoria. June 13.â As I telegraphed yester- j
day from one of our outposts, fifteen miles j
east of Pretoria, the Boers evacuated their
position during the night of June 12. They had
paid so much attention to strengthening their
flanks that their center was weakly held, and
as soon as this became evident, on June 12, I
directed Ian Hamilton to attack. He moved
against Diamond Hill with the SufTolks. Derby
shires and City Imperial Volunteers, supported
, on the left by the Guards* Brigade under Inigo
Jones.
It was grand seeing the way our men ad
vanced over the. difficult ground and under a
heavy flre.
The casualties. I am thankful to say. nvere
less than 100. a very small number consider
ing the natural strength or the position which
had to be carried.
Our seizure of Diamond Hill caused the
Boers to feel they were practically surrounded,
and this resulted in their hasty retirement.
They were being followed yesterday by some
of our mounted corps.
Hamilton spoke in high terms of the troops
engaged. Hamilton received a contusion from
a shrapnel bullet in the shoulder, but is not,
I am happy to say. unable to perform his duty.
The rest of Lord Roberts' dispatch deals
with the casualties and General Baden-
Powell's movements in Western Trans
vaal, where Baden-Powell, with SOT men.
is systematically re-establishing order and
collecting arms and supplies. About 600
Boers have surrendered, and Baden-Pow
ell has captured 230 prisoners.
According to Baden-Powell's report tha
Boers will readily discuss terms of sur
render, and they all appreciate the work
of pacification by his troops.
KLERKSDORP SURRENDERED
BY THE SON OF CRONJE
June 15.â The War Office is?
sued the following dispatch from Lord
Roberts:
Pretoria Presidency, June 14, 10:40 p. m.â
Klerksdorp surrendered on June 9 to an armed
party sent on by Hunter.
Kitchener reports that the Boers attacked a
construction train early this morning north
of Rhenoster River. He sent out mounted
troops iÂ»nd drove off the enemy before they
could fio damage. One man was killed and
eleven wounded. Including two officer*.
A messenger from Klerkadorp reports that
Crpnje, who commanded there, determined |g
surrender as soon as he knew for certain that
Pretoria was In our possession. His example
has been copied by many In the neighborhood.
By the peaceful occupation of Klerka
dorp, announced by Lord Roberta, the
British have grained a strategic position of
some impertance, as the town la not only
the terminus of another railroad to Jo
hannesburg, but it is within Â«>asy roach of
the Kroonstad-Vlerfontein Railroad.
The Cronje who surrendered the place la
a son of the famous General Cronie. now
a prisoner at St. Helena. The son wa.i
prominent, during the siege of Mafpk'ns.
Apart from the fact that Lord Roborta"
dispatch comes direct from Pretoria,
showing the telegraph line is reopened,
the only other point of Interest is the fact
that the Boers whom General Methuen
was reported to hav#Â» utterly routed have
recuperated sufficiently to attack a re
construction train.
. A dispatch from Kimberley reports th<Â»
capture of the well-known pugilist. "Jim"
Holloway, who was an adjutant in the
Boer army and who blew up ;1ip bridge at
Fourteen Streams. Holloway was amort?
a body of Federals captured in the west
ern part cf the Transvaal. â¢
The Afrikander P.und Consrress opened
at Paarl to-day, with seventy dpip^ates.
Including seven Assemhlymen,' present.
It is feared at Cape Town that the Par
liamentary deadlock will lead to a tem
porary suspension of the constitution, and
there is much anxiety in regard to the
possible outcome of the grave step. Sir
John Gordon Sprigs Is experiencing much
difficulty in forming a Cabinet. Mr.
Schreirer persisting in his refusal to sup
port a ministry dominated by Cecil
Rhodes, owing to personal antipathlea. A
coalition seems Impracticable. Messrs.
Rose-Innes and Solomon are not inclined
to accept subordinate positions in a gov
ernment composed of nominees of th*
South African League. If Mr. Schreinrr la
dissatisfied with the personnel and pledges
of the new ministry the latter will be un
able to pass Imperial measures and a dan
gerous deadlock will ensue, which may
lead to a grave constitutional crisis.

MOSE GUNST BOOMS GAGE
FOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY
f] OI^UMBIA CITY, Ind.. 'June 15.â The nearer the" delegatio/i approaches the goalthe more exciting and Interesting
I matters become. The train made up none of the time It "was behind yesterday and the morning found the dele-
I gatiom about four hours late. That gave them a chance to see the verdant, fertile country as, they passed
\. through Iowa. At Cedar Rapids the Chicago papers were procured. The Chicago Times-Herald of June 13
;V""f printed a dispatch from North Platte, Nebr., headed "Boomers of Scott En Route-rCalifornlans . Speak for the
Man Who Built the Oregon." The article contained Interviews purporting to have been given by George C. Pardee,
Judge W. C." Van Fleet and J. 8. Spear Jr., all stating, the consensus of opinion to be that the delegation should do
nothing until reaching, Philadelphia and then if a man from the coast, had any possible chance to present the, claims
of Mr. Scott or any other" available candidate. . iv
On reaching Chicago the .delegation was met by, former. Californlans. noticeably Lee Gunst. W. H. Booth. George
Katz and a number of others. Quite a number of reporters sought: Interviews with the various merabers N of the dele
gatlon.v The representative of the Times-Herald claimed that paper to be advocajtlng and fostering the so-called Scott
boom. The various delegates interviewed made! the same reply: "Wait until we get to" Philadelphia."
M. A. Gunst, being pressed byv. the reporters aa to the attitude of the California delegation in putting forth a can
didate for Vice President, said: ._ ,
"Of course the California delegation would be much honored If it could secure for one of California's citizens a
nomination on the national ticket. However, the* running mate of the President -will, of course, depend largely upon
the wishes of the nomlnee-for President, who will, of course, be President' McKlnley.' California should, in my, judg
ment, assist In selecting the man who will, make the strongest running mate possible , from ; every point of view. "While
I personally have naught to say Â¦ against Mr. Scott." I "know many of the delegates are warm personal friends of Gov
ernor Gage. and if chances favored a Pacific Coast man I. tlilnk many of, the delegation would favor the Governor.'.'
Several of the delegates overheard this; conversation, and seemed to give their tacit assent. .
The traveling , arrangements of the delegation were most complete until they ' reached Chicago and encountered the
Pennsylvania line. Here, through the oversight of the "Â¦ agents V'of; the" Pennsylvania line, the delegates were subjected to
considerable: Inconvenience; "The train had hardly pulled out of the' Chicago station before a . sudden stop gave the
delegates a shaking upland; on, investigation It was found,. the . train had .. collided with a ' freight at a siding. Three
of the . freight . cars were ' toppled \ over and demolished, but no injury of ' moment occurred to the delegation train, other
than a delay of, two hours.":- .\. v . . ...

as he had not been- offered the
nomination it would perhaps be
presumptuous In him to say that
he would not apcept it.
"But," it was suggested, ."many
Democrats throughout the country
are discussing the desirability of
placing you on the ticket with Mr.

"I have never contemplated belns

replied the admiral. "I am not a

Southern Pacific Is
No More.
At a meeting of the Southern Pacific
Company directors held in New York City
Thursday afternoon General T. H. Hub
bard, first vice president of the company,
who represented the Searlcs interests, re
signed his position and H. E. Huntington,
the nephew of the president, was elected
In his place. This Is the logical, natural
outcome of the trend of events beginning
with the purchase by the elder Hunting
ton of the Crocker and Stanford Interests.
The resignation of General Hubbard and
the election of Henry E. Huntington to
the first vice presidency Is the sequence
of the third great purchase made by Collls
P. Huntington. the entire Hopklns-Searles
Interests having been transferred to him.
He Is now virtually the sole owner of the
Southern Pacific Company.
For some months Huntington, the chief,
had an option on the Hopkins-Searles
stock, which aggregates 260,000 â¢ shares.
This last deal was conducted by Hunting
ton's financial agents, Speyer & Co. and
Kuhn, Loeb & Co., two big banking firms
of New York City. What was paid for
this vast bulk of stock can only be con
jectured, but it is generally agreed that
it was in the neighborhood of $10,000,000.
As first vice president Henry Hunting
ton will not only be at the head of the
Southern Pacific* Company but he will be
unhampered in his control and manage
ment of the great railroad property. As
the direct representative of his uncle, who
has made Ne\v York his home, he will
have entire charge of affairs on this coast.
The day of warring factions and adverse
claims by Interested parties owning stock
In the Southern PaMfie has passed. It Is
now on the face and in fact all Hunting
tonlan.
H. E. Huntington. who is now in Los An
geles, confirmed the report last nigrht of
his election as first vice president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company. When
asked about the policy he would pursue
in his management of the railroad prop
erties Mr. Huntington said:
"There will be no change either In the
policy heretofore In effect or In the man
agement of the road. I shall continue the
policy now In vogue, continuing to give
thp- pVople of California the very best ser
vlro known in railroad circles."
Mr. Hunting-ton will be in Los Anpeles
and vicinity for several days inspecting
electric and steam railroad properties in
which the Huntlngtons are Interested,.

IDO : not intend that Attorney
Chretien or any ona else shall
negotiate for the sale of posi
tions in the Police Department
while I am at the head of^the de
tective force. Notwithstanding the
fact that the Grand Jury refused to
indict him I have determined that
he shall not go unpunished. I have
consulted with the District Attorney
and expect that a warrant will bs
issued for Mr. Chretien's arrest in a
few days."
Captain of Detectives Seymour seems
determined to prosecute "Jack" Chretien,
the well-known attorney and clubman, for
negotiating for the sale of a position on
the police force to Edward Darcy. a grip
man In. the employ of the Market-street
Railway Company. Darcy was anxious
to become a policeman, and as he lacked
the necessary influence he was advised to
see Chretien, who was represented as the
friend and legal adviser of the Police
Commissioners.
Darcy's story of subsequent events, as
told by himself in the presence of Captain
Seymour and the official stenographer of
the department, is as follows:
Statement of Darcy.
"Several weeks prior to October 25, 1S33,
Officer Hickey. wno Is doorkeeper at the
Citv Prison. Introduced me to a man
named Kelly, whose first name I do not
know. The object of the introduction was
to make me acquainted with some one
who had sufficient influence to get me a
place on the police force Hickey knew
that I had some money which I was will
ing to give for the privilege of wearing a
star Kelly was also aware that I had *u00
and would willingly give it to any one
who would have me appointed a member
of the Police Department. On October 2o.
1899 by a previous agreement with Kelly
I met him in a saloon on Summer street,
a lane that runs off the west side of Mont
gomery street, between Pine and Califor
nia. The saloon is on the north side of
Summer street.
"The object of the meeting was to have
Kelly Introduce me to John M. Chretien.
Tom Doran, a friend of , mine, accompanied
me to the saloon. My object in taking
him with me was to have him as a wit
ness to the transaction.
Introduced to Chretien.
"When we reached the saloon both Kelly
and Chretien were there. Kelly introduced
me tOvChrctlen, who, he said, was the
proper man to see to get a place in the
Police Department. Kelly at that time
said that it would reauire money to get
the position, and that Chretien was just
the man to fix it. Hickey was not present
at the meeting. After Kelly Introduced
me to Chretien he walked away after
promising to" return and talk the matter
over with us. . â¢ .
"I had $3<J0 with me â the amount I
was to put up for. being made a police
man. I drew the sum out of the Hlber
nia Bank. As an, evidence of good faith
I went to " the Bank of California,
where I deposited the money, receiving
a certificate of deposit for the amount.
My friend Doran was with me at the
time. We returned to the saloon shortly
afterward and met Kelly and Chretien.
"After a short conversation Chretien,
Doran and I went to the Safe Deposit
building, at California and Montgomery
â¢ "There,". Darcy said, "the following
agreement was drawn up:
The Agreement.
SAN FRANXISCO. Cal.. October 23, 1S99.
Received of Edward Darcy certificate of de-
he deposited It In his box in the Safe De
posit In the presence of Doran and my
6elf. Before the certificate was deposited
In Chretien's safe deuoslt box it was
placed in an envelope and the envelope
sealed. Chretien. Doran and I affixed our
signatures to the envelope before It was
placed in the safe deposit box.
"The certificate of deposit was to be
left in Chretien's box until I received my
appointment as a police officer, after
which it was to become the property of
the attorney.
"I have seen Chretien several times
since October 23. He assured me
that everything was all right and that I
would receive the appointment as soon
as there was a vacancy in the police
force. The last time I saw him was four
or five weeks ago. I have- seen Kelly
once since October 25. I have since
.learned that he had to leave the city as
he feared being arrested for cheating an
Italian out of a milk ranch.
The Certificate ; Disappears.
"I did not indorse the certificate of de
posit nor did I authorize Chretien to do
so. During the month of March I called
at the Bank of California to see about the
certificate. I told the clerk to stop pay
ment on it as I had lost it. The clerk in
formed me that the money could not be
drawn by any one but myself, as it was
indorsed by me, and I went away satis
fied.
"My object in telling the clerk that the
certificate had been lost was a ruse to find
out whether the amount had been drawn
or not. A short time afterward I re
turned to the bank to demand payment on
the certificate of deposit. The rtason I
was so anxious to get the' money was that
I had been told that when I became a
member of the force I would have to
swear that I had not paid for the posi
tion, and I did not want to- swear to a
lie. I have frequently told Chretien that
the plan to get me on the force was a fail
ure and that I wanted to drop it. He.
however, assured me that everything was
all right and that my appointment had
been agreed upon by the Police Commis
sioners. Afterward I learned that Chre
tien had drawn the money, but he has
made the amount good since then."
Seymour Takes Action.
Evidently, scenting trouble, Chretien,
who in some way had learned of the
On hearing Darcy's statement Seymour
went to the Bank of California and se

of Djjrcy was indorsed on the back, not

gery. He was then asked to write his sig
nature on a piece of paper, which he did.
A comparison of the two signature*
showed that the one attached to the cer
tificate of deposit was a rank forgery.
As Darc>* refused to say whether or not
he had indorsed the certificate of deposit
the Grand Jury could take no action and
the matter was dropped.
Chretien to Be Prosecuted.
Captain Seymour does not intend that
Chretien shall escape being punished If
he can help it. Darcy's lamentably weak
effort to shield the attorney has convinced
him that under other circumstances he
might be forced to tell the truth.
If he fails to make out a case against
Chretien he Intends to prosecute him on
another charge growing out of a similar
transaction. The name of the victim in
the case Seymour refuses to divulge at
the present time. Ho is an old man. and,
being anxious to make his son a police
man, he was advised to see Chretien, who
was supposed to have a â¢'pull" with the
Police Commissioners. Seymour says that
Chretien got $400 from him on the promise
that he would have the son appointed a
member of the police force.
Although this was some time ago. the
son is still without a star, and the old man
continues to mourn for the hard-earned
money that he paid to Chretien.
To-day an effort will be made to locate

he is up against it he will make a com

members of the force. Captain Seymour
is satisfied that he was innocent of any

The Oaklands and the Stocktons will
furnish entertainment Â¦ at the league
grounds this Â¦week. As both teams are
fighting for second place the contest will
no doubt be watched with considerable.
Interest. If the Dudes win to-day they
will be In* second place. ' If they are able
to keep up their gait they should take a
majority of the series. The addition of
Borchers to the team is fortunate, as the
Oaklands were weak in the box. The
shifting of Francks to short is also an
improvement. Schmeer was a showy
shortstop, but unreliable. The line-up for
to-day is as follows: ,

THROUGH THE FAIR GREEN
The second annual contest for the Prince
Poniatowskl cup will be held on the links
of the Burlingame Country Club On Inde
pendence day. The first contest was won
by Miss Alice Moffitt cf the Oakland Golf
Club with a total score of 122 for the
eighteen holes, her nearest competitor be
ing Mrs. R. Gllman Brown of the San Ra
fael Golf Club, whose score was 127. Miss
Moflltt's recent marriage has removed her
from the ranks of the contestants and the
struggle will probably be between Miss
Alice Colden Hoffman (who recently won
the San Rafael Golf Club's Council's cup
for women), Miss Mary Scott and Miss
Rowe. .
One of the strongest players in Southern
California is H. T. Hays of Riverside,
who, having won the championship of the
Pachappa Club and also of the Rubidoux
Club, may be regarded as the champion
of Riverside. In the final round for the
championship of the Rubidoux Golf Club
his antagonist was J. R. McNab. Mr.
Hays playing a strong, steady game, de
feated him by the decisive score .of 6 up,
4 to play, in a match over thirty-six holes.
The scores on several of the holes were
better than those of the redoubtable
"Colonel Bogey." '
In the Decoration day tournament of
the Los Angeles Country Club W. W. Ste
vens and J. H. NlcoH tied for first net
score, each having: a net record of 161
for thirty-six holes. The first attempt to
settle the winner by a match over eight
een holes resulted In a tie; and on June 2
the competitors met again. Nlcoli Ci?4e
a score of 95 less 14â SI. while 'Stevens'
score was 102 less 22â SO. Stevens thus won
by one stroke. The sweepstakes handicap
on June 2 was won by G. C. Lines, with
a gross score of 94, and a net of 76.
. In the contest for the championship of
the Pachappa Golf Club at Riverside
Hays and Butter were in the final round.
The former won at the twenty-eighth nole
in a thirty-six hole match, 9 up, '8 to play.
Hays tied sixteen bogey scores and mada
ten other holes in one stroke more than
bogey.
The first Invitation tournament of the
San Diego Golf Club was held last month
and was highly successful. Fourteen
golfers went over from Los Angeles and
played in an 18-hole handicap tournament.
The first prize was won by J. Jeone of Los
Angeles with a score of 108 less 18â90, the
second award being taken by N. Wilshlre
of the same city with a score of 114 less
14â100. James Irvine of the San Diego Golf
Club won the driving contest with a drive
of 186 yards. Seventeen competitors hand
ed in cards in the handicap, the best gross
scores being Jeone's 108 and Tuft's 109. -
The following are the results of the
play In the ladies' handicap on the Oak
land links last Saturday: Mrs. W. P.
Johnson (scratch) beat Â¦ Miss Lucy Moffltt
(received two strokes on nine holes) 1 up;
Mrs. F. E. Magee - (received two strokes
on nine : holes) beat Miss Whitney (re
ceived four strokes on nine holes) 2 up, 2
to play. Â¦ Â¦
Why the local team has not been able
to work its way out of the marsh in
which it aeems to have sunk is a puzzle.
Manager Harris has an aggregation of
men that are high priced and have repu
tations for first-class ball playing. The
fact is that "Uncle" is paying more in
salaries for his basket of "pretzels" than
any other manager in the league. Reitz,
the new shortstop, receives $135 a month;
Schwartz $100, Pabst $100, Iburg $100 and
the rest of his men average $75 per month.
When it is taken into consideration that
but two games a week are played these
salaries are by no means meager. Sacra
mento, of course, pays $2600 to Hughes,
but half of this is made up of subscript
tions by prominent business men of the
town. The local team as it now stands is
at last settled. Manager Harris antici
pates good ball from them the rest of the
season. What they need is a little
courage and some confidence. Â©
It remained for the Oaklands to* stop
the wild rush of the local team to the
front. After winning five straight games
"Uncle" Hank's German band went up
against the Dudes and were. overwhelmed
by base hits. But to be beaten by the
Dudes is no longer a disgrace, as Ewlng's
men are playing ball in championship
form. They make errors, but they smash
the ball with marked regularity. They
drove Doyle out of the box two weeks ago
and even the mighty Hughes could work
no more than a tie game with them. In
view of their performances the Friscos
should not be too severely criticized for
having suffered defeat. Last Sunday
afternoon "Uncle's" players demonstrated
ânotwithstanding their defeatâ that they
were made of the right stuff. A lucky
streak of hitting and an error by Hilde
brand. who is probably the most reliable
outfielder in the league, gave the Dudes
a big lead. It was enough to take the
heart out of the average team, but the
Friscos played ball and it was only by a
fluke in base running that they lost. They
are again at the tail end. but are not out
of the race. The following table shows
the standing of the teams:
The standing of the teams at present
shows a healthier condition to the compe
tition than for many preceding weeks, as
far as the relative position of Stockton,
Oakland and San Francisco is converned.
Sacramento still leads with a 150 per cent
break between its team and the second
club of the league (Stockton). The closest
in percentage are Stockton and Oakland,
but 2*3 per cent dividing them. These two
teams will meet this afternoon on the
local grounds.
The results of the baseball games on
Saturday and Sunday last, while not help
ing the local team to any great extent,
have tended to bring three, of the teams
in a closer and more tactual position.
After winning five games. Harris' choice
collection of players . went back to their
old habit and lost two to the Dudes.
These same Dudes have been doing things
to the best In the league, swatting with a
fierceness that makes them real live men.

The fishing season is in full swing at
Lake Tahoe, rÂ«>orts from that place be
ing to the effect that trolling is good.
The trout are biting freely at both Tahoe
City and Ta'.Iac. The railroad from
Truckee to Tahoe has eliminated one of
the disagreeable features cf the trip, a
stage ride over dusty roads, which was a
revere triai up to the present time.
Reports from the Upper Sacramento are
discouraging to anglers, the weather be
ing warm and tÂ£e catches poor.
F. C. Sanborn and F. P. McLennon re
turned on Monday from Stony Ford.
They report Stoney Creek in fine condi
tion and that they caught all the fish they
could dispose of. The fish took the fly
freely. On Saturday the anglers fished
downstream from Devils Gate to the
Pole Cars, where they arrived at 11 a. m.,
established a camp and enjoyed luncheon.
They did not fish any more that day, as
they had fifteen pounds of trout and
could use no more. On Sunday they
started at the North Fork and again
fished downstream to the Pole Bars. A
north wind was blowing and comparative
ly few fish were taken between the fork
ar.d Devils Gate. The party then went to the
north side of Devils Gate. This should in
terest all anglers who contemplate a trip
to this stream, as it is generally supposed
the Gate Is impassable without a climb of
2000 feet. The lishing Sunday night was
line, the sportsmen taking about twentv
four pounds of fish, which they brought
home in line condition.
Bart Noyes and wife will go to Stony
Ford early next week. They will be gone
some three weeks, staying at Goulding's
a portion of the time and also at Foutz

W. W. Van Arsdale Is reported to have
purchased the land on both Fides of the
MeCloud River, from Squaw Creek to the
Whittier place. It is his intention to
make of it a fishing preserve for the
benefit of the people who go to Fowlers
during the season. It will be patrolled
to prevent poaching on the part of per
sons who have no right to fish there.
W. It. Whittier and family are spend

PIGEON MATCHES.
The race of the San Francisco Yacht
Club from Vallejo to Sausalito last Sun
day was the most picturesque and inter
esting event of the present season. Five
yachts took part in the race In class one
and five in class two. G. E. Billings' sloop
Nixie, with a time allowance of 29 minutes
58 seconds, beat all the big schoonersâ
Lurllne. Aggie, Chispa and Bamona. Nix
ie's actual time over the twenty-six-mile
course was only 7 minutes 32 seconds
longer than Aggie's. On corrected time
Chispa took second place, Aggie third,
Lurllne fourth and Ramona last. Besides
the club race there was a match between
the schooners Lurline and Aggie, which
resulted in a close contest, Aggie winning
by 11 seconds actual time. In class two
Siren, with an allowance of 14 minutes 22
seconds, beat Thetis by ten minutes 40 sec
onds; Cygnus was third, being beaten by
Thetis by the narrow margin of 2 minutes
45 seconds. The former champion of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, A. Sutherland's
Catherine, and the recent addition from
the California Yacht Club, the sloop Sur
prise, were both distanced.
From Vallejo down to California City
the conditions were favorable for fast
time, there being a strong breeze and lit
tle sea. From the time Raccoon Straits
were entered the wind was light and full
of flaws. Theke was consequently a good
deal of luck about this part of the race.
The Corinthians cruised to Petaluma
drawbridge last Saturday, returning on
Sunday. On the homeward trip there was
a race between the sloops Aeolus, Truant.
Mignon and Amigo. in which the first
named came out a winner by a large mar
gin. To race out of Petaluma Creek is a
somewhat risky business, and the depth
of water under the keel of the Aeolus must
often have been inconsiderable. J. W.
Pew's Truant does not draw so much
water as she formerly did, but she sails
as well.
To-day and to-morrow are open days on
the programmes of the San Francisco,
Corinthian and California Yacht clubs.
The California Yacht Club had set to-day
for the annual race for the Wallace tro
phy, which is really the most important
event on the schedule, but finding that few
skippers can get their crews together on
a Saturday afternoon they have decided
to defer the race till July 4. The South
Bays take a moonlight sail to-night and
to-morrow will cruise to Redwood City.
The annual regatta of the South Bay
Yacht Club for the Martin Doerr cup took
place last Sunday over the course near
Alvlso. Five sloops and two schooners
took part. The course was estimated at
ten miles, and was covered by the winner.
A. E. Moody's sloop Cisne, in 2 hours 16
minutes actual timÂ«. The corrected time
of the winner was 1 hour 51 minutes 53
seconds. Sonniksen's (formerly Commo
dore J. C. McKee's) sloop Wanderer took
second place.

specialty club committee reported the
prospects for a circuit of dog shows, be
ginning at Oakland in the latter part of
August and following at Sacramento and
Tanforan in September, as being: exceed
ingly encouraging. A. E. Guy of Seattle,
a prominent fancier of that section, was
elected a member. The first division of

and the following nominations were made:
FOX TERRIER FANCIERS.
The circuit of shows under the auspices
of the American Kennel Club Is an assur
ed fact. On Monday the adjourned meet
ing of the associated specialty cluos of
the Pacific Coast will be held to deter

support to be given the Oakland show.
The bench show of the State Fair Asso
ciation will be held during the second
week in September and will be followed
by the show of the San Francisco and San

will be held at Tanforan Park from Sep
tember 28 to 29 inclusive. The applica
tion or the latter association for member
snip in the American Kennel Club will bo
sent to New York early next week. It 13
understood that John Davidson will be in
vited to Judge, but this is not yet abso
lutely decided on.
Philip C. Meyer, who has done so much,
for the saintly breed on this coast by hi*
liberality in importing the best strains of
blood, had the misfortune to lose that
magnificent St. Bernard, Alta Leo. his
latest acqnlsition from the kennels of
Mrs. Lee of Toledo. Ohio.
The interest in St. Bernards does not
seem to abate with time. Hugh Mc-
Cracken has bred his Sweetheart by Alta

It is probable, that W. K. Meek's mag
nificent young masUfT, Champion Cali

petitor for honors in the ensuing circuit.
A well-known fancier of the breed, who
has recently had tho misfortune to loso nn
imported dog: by death, has sent to Eng
land for another fine specimen to take tlie
place of the one deceased. With two good
stud dogs to breed from there can be lit
tle doubt that this will remain the banner
State for the kins of watchdogs.
In the circular sent out by the commit
tee, which consists of Harold Crowell oC
San Francisco, Samuel Hardy of Oakland
and J. A. Landsberger of Alameda, there
is a conditional provision as to the num
ber of sets to be played in the preliminary
matches. The committee has determined!
upon the best three out of five sets, but
this Is subject to change should it be
deemed advisable to do so at the last
moment. The finals will be the beat three,
out of five, as it has always been. Tha
entrance fee will be Jl and all entries will
positively close on the 2Sth inst. J. J.

The Ariel and the Pioneer rowing clubs'
regatta at Long Wharf last Sunday was
decidedly successful. There was a large
attendance of spectators and the events
were disposed of in such rapid succession
that all were kept amused and Interested.
Except the race among members of the
Pioneer Rowing Club for the Alpers
medal, which was won by C. E.. Ochs, cap
tain of the club, over a course of one and
a half miles with a turn, all the events
took place over a short straightaway
course. The Long Wharf course, though
it has been used for boat racing ever since
the earliest days of San Francisco, and
still affords excellent water for practice,
is not by any means all that can be de
sired for championship events. It is fairly
sheltered from prevailing winds and has
plenty of depth, and consequently of buoy
ancy, but it is not equally fair to all com
petitors. The contestant who gets the in
side station has so much the best of it
that he is certain to beat an antagonist
who is not decidedly his superior.
In the barge race between the interme
diate and junior crews of the Ariel Row
ing Club, the latter, being in better con
dition,! won. Archie Taylor took the lion's
share of the swimming events, tying with
J. A. Geddes In the race in old clothes,
and winning the 100 and 220 yard races.
In the race between crews of the Ariel
and Pioneer clubs, Intended to test the
comparative speed of the new four-oared
barges, the Pioneer crew, stroked by Ochs,
won after a close and exciting contest byj
a quarter of a length. The skiff race for
the championship of the Ariel Rowing
Club brought out William McCausland
and Charles Wilson, the former, who
pulled in his usual good form, winning. A
ra'ce in shells between E. C. Stenberg
and Charles Wilson was won by the
former.
The moonlight parade and water carni
val which was to have been held by the
Alftmeda Boating Club on Oakland Creek
to-night has been abandoned (for the pres
ent at least) on account of the foggy
weather that has -.prevailed recently. The
energetic secretary of the Alamedas, W.
B. Hinchman, has been taking his sum
mer vacation ar.d has not been on hand
to superintend the weather.
â¢ The Triton Swimming: and Boating Club
has not yet arrived at any conclusion
about a new location, the Board of Public
Works being very dilatory in passing upon
the application of the club to remove its
boathouse from the present site to the
foot of Larkin street. It is possible that

Frank McComb has two slashing big

their s!re so strongly that if the three of
them were placed together it would be
difficult to toll the puppies from the old
dog.
Curtis & Sons 'will soon have a new can

Cotton, a puppy by Hughie-Rockette. He
is the only survivor of the litter and his
trials show him to be above the average
class.
Russell, Allen & Wilson have sold Palm
Flower to L. C. Hodgkins, a well-known
coursing man.
William Murphy and George Parkinson
have in Crawford Lass and Ben Lomond,
respectively, the greatest prospects now
in the running here. They are showing
high class form and are expected to do
something big in the California Futurity
next September. This stake will be worth
nearly $1500 to the winner. The grey
hounds were sold by H. F. Anderson for
the proverbial song.
COURSING FOR
A RICH STAKE

Decided To-Morrow at
Union Park.
The ladies' day , champion stake, second
in importance only to the John Grace
challenge cup stake on the leashmarfs
calendar, will be decided to-morrow at
Union Coursing Park. Sixteen of the
fastest greyhounds in America will go to
the slips for the rich prizes offered by the
Interstate Coursing Club. The only nota
ble absentee is For Freedom, the unfor
tunate, a broken toe putting the great im
ported dog out of the running. The cours
ing men are almost unanimous In picking
Beacon and Palo Alto as the greyhounds
which will work their winning way
through the stake until they meet to-mor
row night to determine which shall be
declared the ultimate winner. The stake
may be replete with surprises, however,
and some greyhound held lightly by the
public may carry off all the honors. The
riret round of a 128-dog reserve stake will
be decided to-day. The sport will com
mence upon the arrival of the 10:15 a. in.
train. The trains to-morrow will start at
10:55, 11, 12 and 1 o'clock.
The stake at Ingles4de Park has an en

The members of the California Coursing
Committee at their last meeting transact
ed much business of interest to coursing
men. One of the most important rulings
was the outlawing of the parks at Sun
'Jose and Stockton. All owners running
their dogs at these parks will be ruled off
the field and cannot enter dogs at parks
affiliated with the coursing committee.
Hereafter when an owner desires an
extended pedigree of a dog he must pay
a fee of $1 for the information.
Sires and dams of all litters must be
registered before the litter registration
wiii be accepted.
Secretaries of parks must demand cer
tificates of registration for dogs running
for the first tnpc or having changed own

claims. Dr. Clark of Stockton, who pur
chased two of the puppies, has been sum
moned as a witness.
The name All Glory, claimed for a grey
hound, has been rejected, it being too
much like Old Glory.
T. J. Cronin was notlflea that he must

he must cttange the names of Wild Tralee
and Rose of Tralee, they having , been
claimed some years since by Kastern
coursing men and duly registered.' â¢ Â¦
Gladys Pasha, leased by Joseph Maz

seven in all and six of them are dogs.
James Dean's Brilliantine, pronounced
the most perfect looking greyhound'; in
America, is to be mated with R. E. de-B.
Lop/;z & Son's imported dog Shylock.-the
sire of Mose/ Maori Land and other fast
oqes. Brilliantine has not been a success
on the field, but something good is expect
ed from this cross.
Pat Horgan's Just Eclipsed, by the great
English sire Herschel, has whelped a litter
of seven puppies to T. J. Cronin's Wild
Tralee. The last litter out of the same
greyhound included Pat Horgan, the most
promising puppy of his time but since
killed, Lucretla Borgia, Manila and other
Â¦winners. Â« Â¦ . .'- Â¦;Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦

men will conjure to-morrow at Union Coursing Park. These eight greyhounds and as many more will meet . in the Ladies' Day
Champion Stake, under the patronage of the Interstate Coursing Club. This is one of the most valuable stakes ever run for in this
country, and it has attracted the best dogs in America. The close students of form expect Curtis & Son's blue dog Beacon and Eugene *>
Geary's Palo Alto to meet in the all-important deciding course. As chance enters largely into every contest on the coursing field, the ?
cleverest tipsters may be put to contusion.

SAN JOSE, June 15. â A novel move and
at the same time an expensive one to the
county was made to-day by Attorney
Samuel B. Terrill in his own defense to
the charge of embezzlement growing out
of a transaction with Edwin Bunney, by
his demanding the subpenalng of over 2000
witnesses. This strategic move of Terrill
staggered Sheriff Langford, and thi^ offi
cial and his deputies had visions of being
buried alive under an avalanche of sub
penas.
The document was issued by County
Clerk Pflster, and attached to It are some
thirty pages of the County Directory of
1897, comprising every name from A to
and Including E. It is made returnable
before Judge Lorlgan on June 18. Fur
thermore. Terrill Is threatening to sub
pena several more thousand witnesses â
every one of the 26,000 people In the direct
ory.
Several years ago Terrill secured $260
from Edwin Bunney to loan at Interest.
Shortly after he told Bunney he had made
a loan and gave him what purported to be
a note signed by R. J. Mclntyre. It sub
sequently proved worthless, as na R. J.
Mclntyre could be found, and the Grand
Jury Indicted Terrill on a charge of em
bezzlement. Â¦ . .
The defendant now proposes by sub
penalng everybody In the county If neces
sary to prove that such a person as Mc
lntyre existed. If this should be done the
cost would be between $75,000 and $100,000.
Rather than incur any delay and such ex-
Dense it is supposed District Attorney
Campbell will admit that such a person as
Mclntyre existed.
It is not likely that Terrill's mammoth
subpena will be served, as the time la
too short, and Sheriff Langford doubts its
Icclitv
The trial of the Bunney case, which be
gins on the 48th, is Terrill's eighth trial
on indictments growing out of charges of
forgery or embezzlement. Six have re
sulted in disagreements or acquittals and
one conviction. There are three more still
pending. _^__________^__

IN SAN JOSE
Special Dlsr>ateh to The Call.
SAN JOSE, June 15.â San Jose has a
brass band composed entirely of so
ciety young ladies. They will make
their initial bow to the public in a
concert to be given at the Victory
Theater en June 24, and the belles
and beaux of social circles are on the tip
toe of expectancy awaiting the event.
It is believed to be the only organization
of the kind on the coast, certainly the
only one of its size. It comprises twenty
pieces, from the sweet, low note of the
piccolo to the snare drum, with its bells
and other filigree work. The entire or
ganization is composed of native daugh
ters.
The California Indies' Band was or
ganized six months ago by Leader Fred
Brohaska. At that time but three of tho
young ladies were familiar with a single
gold fringe and cord, and epaulettes, with
a Jaunty turban, has been adopted.
The California Band is as yet a little
shy. but this coyness will be thrown off
at the concert to be given at the Victory
Theater, and the people will be treated to
several entertainments during the coming
summer. The programme to be rendered
will consist of overtures, marches and up
to-date music. Other numbers on the pro
gramme are a soprano solo by Mrs. Mary
Weaver-McCauley, alto solo by Miss Ade
line Birchler, violin solo by Miss Grace
Freeman, with Mrs. Romayne Hunkins as
accompanist. The entire programme will
be given by ladies.
The ladies are in great demand for en
tertainments, but all offers have been re
fused. The Elks offered them $100 and an
elaborate float to ride in if they would
participate in the Fourth of July parade
but they have steadfastly refused.
A visit to the watering resortsâ Santa
Cruz, Capitola, Monterey and Pacific
Grove â will be made next month and con
certs given in each place.

city and it became necessary to break in

ments made by the witness. Dlttleback
also charged that two convicts had been
given citizen clothing on a requisition
signed by Wilkinson and at the expense of
the State. This brought forth a hot de
nial bjr, the Warden. In concluding his
testimony the witness said that it looked
to him as though the business at the
prison was carried on for private gain,
and not for the public good.
Warden Wilkinson testified that he had
Investigated the fight at Burke's; that he
was opposed to such practices and the
men know that they would be punished if
they behaved improperly. He admitted
having discharged the three guards and
that they were still in the employ of the
prison. He said he had not investigated
the case, and had not gone into town, be
cause he had not the time to leave the
prison, as he did' not expect to get the
truth in a saloon. He said he discharged
Dittelbach for cause and not because he
wanted to create a vacancy for a friend.
He enumerated Dittelbach's bad qualities.
He said he dismissed Lieutenant Lam
phrey because the latter swore at the
convicts and new guards and showed that
he was opposed to his administration. Jie
said he discharged Joe Pregrmore, the
guard who earned fame by nipping an
outbreak among the prisoners in 1835, be
cause, the latter v.-as carrying tales to out
siders. -In discharging Pregmore he told
him that he wanted guards and not re
porters.
The Warden explained that he dealt
with Well man. Peck & Co. and Miller,
Sloss Â«Sr Scott because he could save
money for his prison. He said that during
his short administration he had saved
$1500 nnd would materially increase that
amount by economy and strict attention
to business.
Director Fitzgerald asked to be sworn
and made a statement In his own behalf.
He said that any statement made that he
had entered into an arrangement with
Warden Wilkinson to control the patron
ape of the prison was absolutely false
He said he had never asked the Warden
to mnke room in the prison for any friend
cf his. He also said that he tried to dis
suade his brother from accepting a' posi
tion In the prison.
Director Devlin said there had been a
feud between two sets of officers and
\\ .Trtfen \\ ilkinson had made a mistake in
trying to settle it himself. He thought
the directors should have been consulted
The directors then went Into executive
session.

ep was Thomas Wilkinson, the head of
the peral institution located in this vicin
ity. The latter was grilled for nearly a
half-hour by Director K. T. Devlfn of Sac
lamento. who r.rked him to give reasons
why he discharp<d certain men from the
prison and also to explain his course since
assuming rhar?c of the prison. " /"
Warden Wilkinson was angry, aod he
did not conceal his choler. He drummed
r.crvouFly on the table while replying to
Pevlin's interrogations, and hisÂ«iolce was
jit a high pitch when answering the per
tinent questions put to him. That Mr.
Devlin was' filssatlsflcd with the Warden's
conduct was ovinced at the outset of the
evening: session. He had secured the at
tendance of numerous witnesses, who
were only too willing: to testify apainst
the Warden's administration. Eugene

had seen Guards Galardin and Slavin

FORM A BRASS BAND
HANFORD, June 15.â The closing Inci
dent in the fight for old Sam Page's es
tate occurred here last night when Mrs.
A. D. Smith, a professional nurse, arrived
from San Francisco and carried off Baby
Winifred, claimed by Mrs. Page to be
the posthumus child of Samuel Page and
heir to a largo estate. To-day Mrs. Page
admitted to Ellas Page that the child was
borrowed, her own being born deformed
and dying soon after. The parents of
Winifred have been paying for its sup
port, but losing hope ot sharing old
Page's dollars, sent for the child and the
widow's hopes have gone a-gllmmerlng.
The fight for the old man's estate be
tween the widow and Page's grown-up
children has been very bitter. Mrs.. Page
and the child have been residing hero
some months and the present complica
tion is a great surprise to the community,
almost every one believing in the child s
authenticity and none more firmly than
Eliaa Page, Sol Page and Mary Garver,
It looks like the scheme of an adven
turess to secure the possessions of a dot
ing old man and the taking away of the
child is probably the result of a disa
greement between several parties to the
transaction. New that the child 19 out

the next move will be watched with
great interest. Xot long since the widow
threatened to kill Ellas Page, who runs

off the place. She drew a pistol on him,
and also ran Ellas' hired man off the
place.

came for the child Is the same who
nursed Mrs. Page In Oakland last De
cember, and she admitted that she knew
the parents of Winifred. Now that the

not known what steps the widow will
take next, but the discovery of her du

SHOULD the conference called by the Lincoln
Monument League to devise means for an
early construction of the proposed memorial be
a? well attended and as earnest as the object of the
League merits, it will result in a marked advance
ment of the movement. In every important city in
the United States there should stand monuments to
Washington, who founded the republic, and to Lin
coln, who saved it from dismemberment. There is no
better way of providing for embellishment of great
cities than by the erection of rnjemorials which, in ad
dition to adorning some notable site or park, serve to
recall the memory of great men and to stimulate in
the minds of the young a worthy and patriotic ambi
tion.
San Francisco, although the youngest of the larger
cities of the'Union, has already taken an enviable rank
among them for its artistic culture and accomplish
ment. What we have is but a slight thing in com
parison 'with what a European city of equal wealth
and population has to show in the way of art. but it
is meritorious for an American city, and sufficient to
encourage the promoters of every artistic movement
among us.
The proposed monument is one that appeals to
every loyal heart. Should every one in California
who reveres the memory of Lincoln contribute to the
fund there would be no need foj any , one to give
much. A popular subscription of small â¢ amounts
would, in fact, be more desirable than a few large
gifts. It is for the conference to devise plans for ob
tcining such subscriptions, and it is to be hoped they
will be forthcoming. A monument to Lincoln worthy
of the man and of the city is one of the municipal
adornments which San Francisco ought to have.

Right to Carry Banners.
Isidor Jacobi, a union cloakmaker, who
was arrested for carrying a banner in
front of a cloak house on Market street
that is in trouble with the Cloakmakers'
Union, "appeared before Judge Mogan yes

that the ordinance under which the arrest
was made specially makes an exception in
cases of labor and charitable organiza

missed the case. Seven others arrested
for the same offense appeared before
Judge Fritz. The same point was made,
and the cases were continued till Tuesday

Attorney General Refuses to Lend
State Aid in Suits Against
Legitimate Districts.
Attorney Ueneral Tlrey L.. Ford has de
clined to be in any way a party to as
saults upon irrigation districts without
very RÂ«w>d and sufficient reasons. Thirteen
yeanÂ« mjo thf Turlock Irrigation District
In Stnrilf'ius County was formed, and re
cently s**nÂ»l lawyers made application
to the State n attorney for permission to
tiring action Â«n the name of the people
against the district, alleging that the peti
tion for the formation of the district and
the published notice thereof were defec
tive Mr. Ford declines to bring action
against the district to determine the va
lidity of the organization.
The Attorney Oeneral based his refusal
upon the ground that the district has been
In existence for over twelve years; that
during all of that time officers of the dis
trict have been regularly elected by the
voters of the district: that through these
ofHcers taxes have been levied and collect
ed bonds issued and sold, contracts for
ths construction of works entered into,
large turns of money expended In and
about the prosecution of the work of the
district, and in connection therewith
rights of considerable magnitude have ac
crued: and that during all this time the
district performed the duties and exer
cised the powers pertaining to a legally
and regularly organized district.
The Attorney General holds that al
though there may have been some tech
nlcaf defects in the original organization
of the district such organization has
remained too long unquestioned to be now
made the subject of judicial controversy.
He argues that by Its long acquiescence
the State has consented to the exercise
of municipal powers by the district in
question. The Attorney General further
intimates that under the decision of the
Supreme Court of this State In the recent
case of People vs. Linda Vista Irrigation
District the State is barred from institut
ing proceedings in quo warranto against
an Irrigation district after a lapse of two
years from the date of organization of
such district.

NOT A YELLOW DOG YEAR.
IT is well for this country that yellow dog years in
politics do not often come. Xo party gets so
strong that it can depend upon the allegiance of
the people to the extent of safely affronting their
ideas of decency. A majority of every American
community is made up of good and self-respecting
people. When a party promotes indecency in politics
or if promoted by it, this decent majority crosses
party lines and stands together to punish the ot
fender. This upright majority, which believes in in
tegrity and in all that goes for the moralities and
proprieties of life, public and private, stands guard
against the yellow dog year. We desire to warn the
Republicans of California that this is not a yellow
dog year. Neither in this State nor elsewhere can
the party depend upon the strength of the national
ticket to pull through a local programme planned in
a saloon by blackguards. Why should gentlemen like
Horace Davis. W. W. Montague. Sheldon Kellogg,
and thousands of their peers in this city and State, be
compelled to take their orders in party politics from
behind the bar of a saloon? Why should they be
compelled to relinquish position and part in public
hie. or hold their place by supporting a programme
that has gentlemen at the ornamental end of it and
blackguards at the other, where the results and avails
of victory are divided?
Is it necessary that there be a partnership be
tewcen Republican politics and swipes? If so, let us
j'luck off the eagle or the bear as a vignette on the
ticket and ornament it with a rum blossom and a
prowler.
i he Republican party is going into this campaign
Â»%-:th a strong national ticke*. The Democrats are
poing in with a weak one. But they are backing it
in the clo?e States with the best and strongest local
candidates they have ever nominated. Take In
diana as an example. The Bryan forces there are
making an effort to carry the State. They still surfer
the absence of the corr.e-outers of 1806, who adhered
to straight Democracy and the gold standard. But
there are some discontented Republicans with whom
there is much coquetting. To win them a very strong
Democratic State ticket has been put up, headed bv
Mr. John W. Kern for Governor. The same policy
iÂ« being followed by them in every State in the
North that is considered to be close. They are
eking out the weakness of their national ticket by
strong local nominations. In this way they add
strength to their national ticket, and file a claim for
public approval and support.
If Republicans, relying on the strengtfi of their na
tional ticket, propose to use it as a pack-horse to
cj.rr>- local blackguard programmes and weak local
tickets, it will be <een that they sap its strength down
tc a par with that of the Bryan ticket and leave it
under the disadvantage of a comparison of the local
tickets.
The Call has no candidates and no programme. We
merely inÂ«i?t that a good horse shall not be ridden to
death. We insist that the example of the national
rartv. in putting a strong ticket in the field, shall be
followed by the party everywhere. We insist that the
decency which abounds in the party shall take control
'â¢Â¦â¢ Us affairs and its destiny and that local tickets shall
*Â»e chosen that can be voted without the voter holding
tm nofe with one hand while he stamps his ballot with
That way lies victory; the other way defeat. We
warn the party that the reason of men will decide now
as it did in 1896. Claptrap will not sweeten carrion on
a local ticket, but will only make its pi-esence more
offensive and apparent. '.- y ', '"'
BARON HERMANN, agricultural expert of the
German embassy at Washington, is reported
to have given of the meat bill recently passed by
the Reichstag an explanation which sounds reasonable
and gives promise that the operation of the act will
not be so prejudicial to American trade as has been
feared. His statement is to the effect that the meas
ure is simply a pure food law and is not designed to
exclude any considerable amount of American goods.
According to the Baron each of the states in the
German empire and several of the larger cities have
had laws regulating the trade in foodstuffs, and these
laws have been conflicting in many points. To rem
edy the evils arising from such conflicts the new law
has been enacted providing a uniform inspection and
supervision of the meat trade throughout the empire.
The law provides. for two inspections, one of the live
stock before slaughtering and another of the meat
after it has been prepared for sale. It applies to ani
mals slaughtered for food in Germany as well as to
meats imported from abroad, and is essentially fair
to all parties.
As to the probable effect- of it upon the American
meat trade, the Baron is quoted as saying the framers
oi the measure were confronted with the difficulty of
inspecting certain classes of meats, such as canned
Roods and small bits of pickled meat, and therefore it
was decided "to exclude a few of such products." He
estimates the excluded goods at from 6 to 7 per cent
of the total meat exports from the United States to
Germany, or not more than 2 per cent of our entire
exports to that country; and finally he expresses the
belief that the consumption of the chief exports of
American meat to Germany will be increased and the
trade improved by the operation of the act.
All of that sounds well. It is to be borne in mind,
however, that the new law is a measure whose effect?
will be determined mainly by the way it is applied.
It is true that a fair inspection of American meat ex
ports would not be injurious to the trade, but it is
equally true that it will be easy for the German offi
cials to so construe the law and make the inspections
as to virtually exclude almost all of our meat exports.
When the bill was under consideration in the Reich
stag it was estimated by American experts' that it
would exclude from the German market upward of
60.000,000 pounds of American canned meats and se
riously interfere with the trade in other kinds of
meat. Moreover, much of the German sentiment in
favor of the bill was due to the belief that it would
shut out American meat. It was regarded by the
Agrarians as a cunningly devised tariff for the pro
tection of German farmers,. and it may yet be en
forced with that view.
The exasperating feature of the measure is that it
does not directly impose a tariff duty upon American
meat, but provides a method by which the meat may
be excluded under the pretense that it is unfit for food.
There is therefore the danger that we shall have to
bear not only the loss of the German market, but a
condemnation of our goods which will injure their
sale elsewhere. Fortunately we have in our power
ample means of retaliation should it be necessary to
resort to them. Our imports from Germany are
large, and we can well afford to strike back should
occasion call for it. Such being the situation, we can
accept the statements of Baron Hermann with trust
fulness. If they prove to be correct all will be well,
and, if not, the remedy is in our hands.
THE GERMAN MEAT BILL.
"There is no telling what will happen
to the FIlip!no3 if there is another out
break at Manila." said Sergeant R. L.
Petrie of the Hospital Corps, who - re
turned from the islands on the transport
Grant. "The boys are just dying to get
their hands on those little brown fellows.
The Filipinos have for months carried on
a sort- of guerrilla warfare against the
soldiers in and around Manila that is in
sufferable. They steal and kill whenever
an opportunity is offered. They seem to
have a particular grudge against Hos
pital Corps men and bolo them so often
that that particular branch of the ser
vice has a special score to pay oft when
the time comes. It Is now unsafe for an
American to go any place around the city
alone. The men usually travel In parties
and are constantly expecting to be at
tacked. Only a few nights before I left
Manila, while I was calling upon some
friends at Fort San Diego, we were called
hastily to the Luneta to prevent an out
break, and spent the entire night under
arms. We were anxious to get at them.
I can tell you.
"You can put it down as a certainty that
when the next outbreak does occurâ and
it will not be long comlnpr â there will be
no controlling the army until it has swept
Luzon from end to end and slaughtered
a fearful number of natives. The "boys
will give them no quarter. General Mac-
Arthur Is becoming vastly popular amoni
the rank and file, because he believes in
force in keeping the natives down. Gen
oral Otis was always holding' out the olive
branch to the Filipinos and trying trÂ» win
them over by kindness. That may be all
right in theory, but in practice it does not
work worth a cent. General MacArthur
in his active field operations asain^t the
natives learned to know them better than
to trust them at any time. He shuts his
eyes now and then when the boya avenge
the murder of a comrade, and when the
time comes we believe that he will wage
such a warfare against the natives that
they will be glad to cry for quarter and
will thereafter have a proper respect for
the American soldier and for American
Institutions generally. I might say that
it is the general opinion of army men
in the Philippines that the natives will
continue to fight as long as there are any
of them left."

PERSONAL MENTION.
|7 ILL-IAN BURKHART. comedienne,
nearly played a leading role in a
Jl jj tragedy Wednesday, and for once
the charming actress is congratu
lating herself that she did not make a
howling success of it. It all happened in
real life. It occurred during a fencing les
son, and Professor Tronchet, who -Is
teaching the fetching actres3 the art of
the foils, is to-day nursing a hole in his
head, the result of his pupil's unusual
vivacity and desire to be "realistic."
Miss Burkhart ia preparing to create a
new role, "Captain Suzanne," the princi
pal scene of which is one wherein a fair
young woman in the disguise of a French
hussar engages in deadly conflict with a
German major. It is to meet the require
ments of this role that Miss Burkhart
sent for Tronchet, and i:nd*t his direc
tion began to play with the foil?. At first
it was hard work, and as all wont slowly
the professor was comparatlvrly safe.
But soon Miss Burkbart began to make
unusual pr^grers and at Wednesday's les
son when Tronchft gave his usual com
mand. "Mi'demois^lle. now lunije." thÂ»
foil, wielded by the fair actress struck
Tror.chot full in the head and the Tron
chet fclood did flow.
MIÂ«Â«s I'.urkhnrt with her own fair hand3
bound the professor's wound and Tron
ehet said he did not mind beins wounded
If the J>.nme treatment was v.-arranted to
always po with it.
MlÂ«s Kurkhart will piu on "Captain Su
zanne" at the Ornheum next week and
she is dolnp her level beat to have the
play let remain as it was written, a com
edy, with no possibilities of its being con
verted into a tragedy.

THE NEW DEMOCRACY
THE old Democracy was quite well satisfied with
the constitution of the United States. But the
new Democracy has announced principles
which don't fit the fundamental law. It regards the
constitution as a defective instrument and demands
that it be changed. The Chicago platform, which
Colonel Bryan declares must stand forever as an ex
pression of the principles of the party, requires the
amendment of the constitution in respect to the ap
pointment and tenure of Federal Judges, and as to
the freedom of contract and the power of the courts.
Since then Colonel Bryan has demanded an anti-trust
amendment, and the party at Sacramento this week
declares for two more amendments. If the makers of
the constitution were alive they ought to be ashamed
of themselves for failing to make the constitution suit
Colonel Bryan and his new party.
The Sacramento platform is something of a cu
riosity. It is dissatisfied with the constitution, but
tnkes the San Francisco Examiner and New York
Journal, without amendment, and regards Sillybilly
Hearst's election as president of a political club as de
serving of special mention.
One searches it vainly for any approval of a single
policy or principle upon which Democracy stood
prior to 1896. It declares that the constitution fol
lows the flag. The treaty of Paris, indorsed by Bryan
and ratified by the vote of his supporters in the Sen
ate, put the flag in the Philippines, and Sillybilly
Hearst declared that it must be "nailed" thereto. He
also declared in his paper that Congress could govern
such possessions regardless of the constitution and
outside its limitation?. Now he is indorsed in a
platform which denounces "the doctrine that an
executive or a Congress created and limited by the
constitution can exercise lawful authority beyond
that constitution." But that was just what Silly
billy said they could do and should do, after nailing
the flag to the Philippines!
Every delegate to that convention who indorsed
Hearst's papers for their ''able efforts in advocating
Democratic principles" should be sentenced to sit
down and explain the Democracy of flag-nailing and
government outside the constitution, as advocated by
those same papers.
The old Democracy was a free-trade party. It be
lieved in the open door, wide open to the products 01*
all color, everywhere. But this new party views with
alarm "the bringing of the American toiler into di
rect competition with millions of unassimilated
Asiatics." "Unassimilated" is good. If they are
assimilated the competition will be all right, of
course.
The personal incidents of the convention are not
without interest. The farmers of the State sought a
representative on the delegation. As in 1896, they
put forward Dan Ostrom. But he lives under gov
ernment by injunction. He is a valley farmer and
had to resort to injunction against hydraulic
mining. He was beaten four years ago by men who
want the violator of such an injunction to he tried by
a jury of the vicinity in which his offense is com
mitted. Ostrom and the valley farmers want him to
be dealt with by the Federal court for contempt of
its order. This year slickers prevailed again and the
farmer was turned down and compelled to make a
virtue of necessity and withdraw his own name.
Three delegates at large were taken from the adjoin
ing counties of San Francisco and Alameda. The
ether was bestowed fpon Los Angeles. Looking
over the list it is found to be crowded with the names
cf men who four years ago wrenched the party from
the leadership of Mr. Cleveland, on the silver issue.
They made that issue the test of membership in the
party. But one may search in vain for any reference
to silver in this platform.
The gentleman who nominated Judge Maguire for
delegate at large said that: "Years ago he buckled on
the armor of Democracy." He might have added
that in 1887 he unbuckled it and formally withdrew
from the party, bolted its ticket and fought. against it.
As easily as the Judge laid his armor by, the conven
tion laid by silver. It was not referred to in a single
speech, but was dropped out of sight and out of
sound. No condemned criminal ever fell through
the trap with a duller thud than silver in this con
vention of its professed friends. Yet the men who
used silver as a compulsion to make the party
abruptly about-face in 1896 were still there in force,
controlling its convention and raising an outcry on
other issues as* little consistent with the principles of
the old Democracy. They even forgot to denounce
the gold standard, which Colonel Bryan regards is
the sum of all villainies, and went pawing the aynos
phere for some issue of expediency upon which to
catch votes.
MISS BURKHART LEAVES HER
MARK ON TRONCHET'S HEAD
EXIT THE QUARANTINE:
BY all right-thinking people Judge Morrow's de
cision upon the validity of the act of the Board
of Health in quarantining Chinatown will be
accepted as the final word upon that issue. The
quarantine is held to have been an unwarrantable
exercise of police power, to have been unjustly ad
ministered and uncalled for. Such is the judgment
pronounced after a full hearing of all that the Board
of Health and its attorneys could say in defense.
It is reported that the Board of Health will under
take to justify the establishment of the quarantine,
and to that end will make public what the board re
gards as evidences of the existence of bubonic plague
in the city. It is to be hoped nothing of the kind will
be done. Of what avail will it be to submit evidence
now, when none was submitted to the court? What
will it profit the members of the board to make any
sort of a showing in a pamphlet or a newspaper,
when the records of the court show that i it made
none under judicial investigation?
The time for the board to make its defense, if, it
had any defense, has gone by. The issue has been
judicially closed. The board can hardly expect to get
permission to re-establish the "quarantine by reopen
ing the case. All that could be achieved would be
further contention, controversy and notoriety, with
the result of prolonging and increasing the ill effects
of the scare, which have been already bad enough.
Can any member of the board even to himself jus
tify any action designed to keep up the scare to the
further injury of the city? Is it not time to quit?
From first to last the issue has been mismanaged
by the board. A continental sensation was made out
of a situation which contained few elements of danger
even to Chinatown itself. After the fullest examina
tion Dr. Shrady could find no living case of bubonic
plague in the city; and but few cases of persons who
had died from the 'disease. Before the courts no evi
dence sufficient to convince the Judges of the exist
ence of the plague were submitted. Upon so small
a foundation as that was established a quarantine
which inflicted heavy loss upon Chinese merchants,
gave the city a bad name throughout the world, led
to serious restrictions upon our trade, and at one
time menaced the welfare of all.
So long, as there was any promise of good in the
action of the board there was a considerable support
given to its efforts, but now there is nothing that can
be attained in the way of good by continuing the
sensation. All differences of opinion that remain
may well be tolerated without further controversy.
Let Judge Morrow's decision stand as the final word
on the subject. Let us hear no more of it.

appeared. Thts large mass of people had
been permitted to mingle and communi
cate with one another and persons who
might have been exposed to the plague to
go freely among the remainder of the ten
or fifteen thousand.
The court next turned Its attention to
the discriminating character of the
quarantine. Within the lines of the
quarantine certain houses were excluded
and others were not, said the court, and
the boundary line was made to run
around the rear of certain houses. On
Stockton street . two persona of a race
other than Chinese were excluded from
the quarantine, and thus the quarantine
In terms was Imposed on all the blocks.
r The evidence was clear that this discrim
ination was against the Chinese popula
tion only, ano the reason given was be
cause the Chinese might communicate the
disease from one to another. That was
discrimination In fact.
After reading from the decision in the
Chinese laundry case, the court went on
to say that In this case, assuming that
the Board of Supervisors had Just
grounds for quarantining the district, it
seemed that In Its execution by the Board
of Health they left out certain places In
the district inhabited by members of
races other than Chinese. That was pre
cisely the point in the Chinese laundry
cases which led to the decision of the
United States Supreme Court, and the
characterization of the action of the au
tnorltles as "the administration of the
law with an evil eye and an unequal
hand."
, Discrimination Plainly Shown.
Though on the face of the ordinance
there seemed to be a lack of discrimina
tion, still, continued Judge Morrow, If the
courts found that in Its enforcement there
was that practice and there was the pur
pose to enforce It with "an evil eye and
an unenual hand," It was the duty of tho
court to Interpose and declare the ordi
nance discriminating In character find
therefore void. Such being the case, the
court would hold that the ordinance was
Invalid In that view, as being contrary
to the provisions of the fourteenth
amendment, and that the Board of. Health
haJ no authority or right to enforce any
ordinance discriminating against any
class of persons.
Judge Morrbw next took up the prop
osition whether or not the evidence
showed that the bubonic plague had ex
isted or did exist at the present time In
this city, and read the affidavits of Drs.
E. S. Plllsbury> H. P'Arcy Power. B. A.'
H. Hodghead, George I,. Fitch. George
A. Cable and Miss Dr. Wnrley to the ef
fect that thp cases reported by the
health authorities as of plague were not
of plague at all, but of other diseases
with similar symptoms. Dr. Worley's
affidavit. was that the Chinese girl who
died in the Pacific Hospital had been
.attended by her, and that the disease
was typnold fever. All the affidavits lay
stress upon the fact that no person had
contracted the plague from any of the
dead bodies of Chinese said to have died
of tho bubonic disease.
"I think on such testimony as this."
said Judge Morrow, "I should feel com
pelled to hold that this plague has not
existed and does not exist in this city
but this testimony Is contested by the
Health Board. In the face of such a con
flict of testimony the court does not feel
authorized to render a Judicial opinion
whether or not the plague has or has not
existed." The court added that If the
Board of Health believed or had a rea
sonable suspicion that a contagious or
infectious disease existed In this city it
would unquestionably be their duty to
nrotect the city frnrri It. The cntirt would
leave such questions to be determined
by the proper authorities In that matter.
i Orders Quarantine Abated. - .
"The evidence in this case is very
whole case, and it Is evident from the
whole ease that the answer as to no
knowledge or belief concerning the ex
posure of this complainant 13 a -weakness
I inherent in the cn.se and not in the sub
l ject matter of the answer."
! Judgo Morrow went on to say that there
were 10,000 or more persons in the quar
i antined district and it was quite likely
from that fact that there would be a
great majority concerning whom the de
fendants would have no knowledge and
nothing on which to found any belief.
That difficulty was one that Inhered in
the case rather than In the pleadings, and
the court could not sustain an exception
to the answer on that ground.
The next objection traversed by the
court was that It did not appear from the
answer that the ordinance had not been
passed with the necessary formality re
quired by the charter. The court was un
able to find any evidence to that effect.
It might be thai the charter had not been
compiled with, but that fact had not been
sufficiently shown, and the court must
necessarily presume that the resolution
had been passed with the requisite for
mality.
Jurisdiction of the Court.
The court now came to what It termed
the serious matter Involved in the case,
and that was the objection Interposed on
the part of the defendants that the Fed
eral court had no authority to examine
into the question. It appeared from the
return that a duly constituted department,
of the municipality of San Francisco had
made Inquiry as to the situation and had
adopted resolutions and taken such action
as they deemed necessary, and that that
being an adjudication of the matter on
the part of a body having jurisdiction the
Federal court had no jurisdiction to In
quire Into the reasonableness of the ac
tion of the Supervisors.
On Quarantine Customs.
Upon this branch Judge Morrow read
the affidavit of Dr. John I. Stephens and
explained that he had done bo for the
purpose of showing the method of treat
ment adopted by the Board of Health for
the purpose of supervising this so-called
plague by quarantining ten or twelve
blocks and not quarantining the Infected
houses themselves. It must necessarily
follow that where so many had been quar
antined the danger of the spread of the
disease would be Increased rather than
diminished. Legislation against this class
of sickness was aimed to prevent tho
spread of the disease among the Inhabi
tants of certain localities. The more dense
the population the more danger there is
that the disease will spread. The object
of all such legislation was to confine the
disease to the smallest possible number
of people, as a hou*\ a vessel or a car,
to be isolated, so that the spread of the
disease might be isolated at once. This
system of quarantine was well recognized
In all communities and was provided for
In the laws" of various States and munici
palities. It was the custom to quarantine
the house first, restricting the disease to
the smallest number ar.d that It might
not extend to other people In the same lo
cality. It necessarily followed that If a
large territory was quarantined any large
collection of people there would rather
tend to spread the disease than to re
strict it. In the case of 10.000 people
crowded In that territory the danger
would be increased In an alarming de
gree.
Blunders of the Soard.
If the. plague reported by the Board of
Health on tne 6th of March was the real
plague, continued the court, the most dan
gerous thing that could be done was to
llrst quarantine the whole city as they
did and the next most dangerous thing
was to quarantine a large portion of the
city, as they did In the case of Chinatown,
where twelve blocks ,ha'J been quaran
tined, vujI iv. oÂ»*. ail ?* tiiwm had tho
Â»
collars. '
Ine Japanese seem to have taken the
Initiative in thÂ«? matter by having their
Minister at Washington formally pro
t< st against the discrimination snown by
the health authorities against them. The
opinion seems to prevail, both at Wash
ington ana in this city, that they have
5ust cause for complair.t. Such suits will
be heard by the Federal courts.
As soon as Judge Morrow had con
cluded his decision th^ attorneys for the
fhinesa secured a mandate, which was
placed in the hands or Marshal Shine for
tervlce on the Chief of Police. It was
rot until after luncheon that the writ was
served. Chief Sullivan at once called
upon Prerident Williamson of the Board |
of Health, who hastily called the mem
bers of the board together at 2 p. m. No
comment was msde Â«pon the decision by
any of the members. Attorney Dunne
was present, and when asked by the
president how the board should proceed
rrierely advised that the ofder of the
court should be followed to the letter.
A formal resolution of surrender was
then drawn up and received the Â«PPrpv
ine \-ote of every member of the board.
N>wÂ« of Judge Morrows decision spread
with amazing rapidity through Chinatown
end bv 12:30 o'clock thousands of grin
r n* joking Chinese were crowding
against the ropes, particularly In the vi
cnitv cf Portsmouth Square, looking es
pecially toward the United States Ap
rraiper's building. A crowd of almoM
equal proportions, composed of the repre
sentatives of even- nation under the sun.
gathered outside of the ropes along Kear
m street, waiting to t-ee the fun. About
"o'clock word was parsed that 3 o'clock
nad been the hour fixed for removing the
ronW and the Chinese quietly retired, but
moTt of them remained on the streets
Not a few commenced to open their
etores and set out their wares on display.
Captain Wittman Acts.
At 2 50 p. ra. a patrol wagon from the
central station drove up to the corner of
Clav and Kearny streets and Captain
wRm'n. attired in dtteffl* clothes got
out ar.d issued some quick orders i to the
policemen on guard there. Immediatelj,
the ropes were taken down and a dozen
or moVe Chinese waiting inside hustled
cut on Kearny Ftreet. tneir faces fljJfPlJTf
Irg broad smiles. People on tho outside
and a number of hacks and wagons start
ed into Chinatown. Tl.ere was no excite
ment Captain Wittman. accompanied by
a sergeant and two r.fncers. walked rap
idly northward, passing the order to the
oflicers at every station, and In twenty
minutes-' time had made the complete
round of the ropes. The patrol wagon fol
lowed in the wake of the party, picking
up the coils if ropes at the several sta
tions At Sacramento and Stockton streets j
the Fidewalks were crowded with people
pf all classes pud conditions and a great ]
chattering of tongues tMsued. The usually I
stolid faces of the Chinese were all smiles !
iÂ«nd they watched the proceedings with j
every appearance of satisfaction. :
The work of the Health Boardu army of |
Inspectors ajid cleaners does not show on
the Furfaee, for there are still plenty of
fllthv looking alleys and foul odors arising
frorri damp cellars. One inspector says
that the amount of filth removed and
burred up has been fo enormous that one
who had not actually peen It could not
helleve how much had been accomplished. <
Hut there appears to be yet much to do.
True a Ftrons odor of chloride of lime
pervades the whole place and the yellow
fume* of sulphur arise from manholes
along the streets, but even so strong a
combination cannot down the smell of
park cellars and crowded t?nezflfleÂ»
i
houses, where thousands of the unwashed
live.
I>r. Kellogg's "Suspects."
The Board of Health held a meeting last
night, when young Dr. Kellogg took occa
sion to read a lengthy report on "cases
No. 10, 11 and 12." as he designates them.
Through the slaughter of pigs and other
animals his exploration of the bodies of
the dead and the examination of blood
and tissues he was able to report posi
tively that the victims in each and every
case had died from the bubonic plague.
Caee Xo. 12 was the death that occurred
at 21 Btone street.
The doctor added that he had two more
cases, reported last week. In which he
was certain he would find complete evi
dence of the plague. The board listened
gravely to the reading of this report, and
although It was not signed adopted It and
ordered that it be "spread upon the min
! utes and published in the monthly bulle
tin." Afterward the young doctor carried
the report awiy, saying that .he wished
to make some changes.
Considerable argument arose as to
whether the police guard should be re
moved from the house at 21 Stone street,
where Dr. Kellogg declares a man died
last Tuesday from the plague. The house
has been deserted, the former tenants
leaving behind a quantity of furniture.
Twice the interior has been fumigated,
and placards have been tacked on the
doors and walls announcing in several lan
guages that a death from bubonic piague
occurred there. It developed during the
discussion that wherever a "plague" case
has occurred the Chinese immediately
scatter, end the health officer can never
learn their names or new addresses. The
Chinese have always time to pet away,
because quarantine cannot be established,
according to the board, until after the
autopsy and preliminary tests for plague.
It was* decided to withdraw the police
from 21 Stone street after the furniture
had been inventoried and burned.
Cleansing: Work to Go On.
Dr. Williamson stated to the board that
the work of cleaning Chinatown and the
regular inspection of houses will continue
as before. The fumigation of houses and
sewers and burning of dirt will also pro
ceed. Attorney Dunne will prepare a
resolution asking the Supervisors to take
some action regarding the removal and re
construction of basins In Chinatown. The
doctor announced that It would be neces
sary to drop a number of men employed
during the quarantine-
Japanese Protest at Washington.
A dispatch was received from Washing
ton last night stating that probably as
preliminary to a claim for damages Japan
Hau formally protested against dlscrim-
I !nation displayed by the health authorities
of San Francisco against her subjects.
When the order was issued against iso
lated Asiatics, and in some cases they
were compelled to undergo Inoculation,
both Mr. Xabeshima. Japanese Charge
i d'Affaires. and Chinese Minister Wu vig
orously protested agninst discrimination
â¢ on account of race and urged that if quar
antine were necessary all persons be In
â¢ eluded in it, and not Japanese and Chinese
I' alone. The State Department feels that
botli Japan and China have good grounds
for complaint.
Board Showed Weakness.
United States District Judge de Haven
was not present In court when United
States Circuit Judge Morrow delivered the
opinion in the case of Jew Ho against the
Board of Health, business having called
him out of the city. Hut he concurred in
i the findings and In the opinion, which was
I delivered orally. With reference to the
averment of the board that it had no
knowledge or belief as to whether Jew
Ho had or had not been exposed to the"
plague. Judge Morrow said:

opinion rendered by Judge Morrow in his
ot-ciFion to grant the petition of the Chi
nese for a restraining order against the

fake quarantine. He declared that the
Ici-rd had administered law with "an evil
eye and nn unequal hand" in assuming
tnat a deadly dist-ase existed in a certain
district, when there was no proof that it
did exist, and then In blocking off a large
ar.d populous section of the city, within

strong that the plague has not existed
and aoes not exist In this city," said the
court, "and It follows from the remarks
that I have made that this quarantine
should not continue by reason of the fact
that It Is unreasonable, unjust and con
trary to the laws limiting tne police pow
ers of the State. Secondly, that it Is dis
criminating In its character and contrary
to the provisions of tho fourteenth
amendment to the constitution of the
United States. Counsel for the plain
tiff will prepare an Injunction which will
permit the Doard to maintain a quaran
tine around such places as they may have
reason to believe have contained infec
tious or contagious diseases, but the gen
eral quarantine must not be maintained."
The court also made an order that the
Board of Health should permit physicians
employed by the Chinese to examine and
assist at the examination of the bodies
of persons who may have died from sus
pected plague, and to permit them to
visit their patients in Chinatown. The
quarantine, said the court, should be
placed only upon particular houses. In
which case the attending physician will
be allowed to continue his visits. The
privilege of attending autopsies was also
granted by the court to the physicians
hired by the Chinese, with the proviso
that the privilege must not be abused,
through curiosity or other unworthy mo
tives. ,

PIONEER PHYSICIAN
PASSES AWAY IN CHICO
Death of Dr. Nelson Watts, One of
the Most Prominent Practition
ers in the North.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICO, June 15.â Dr. Nelson Watts, one
of the foremost and most prominent resi
dents of Northern California as well as
the oldest practicing physician in this sec
tion, died here to-day. Nelson Watts was
born in Ohio. January 9, 1830. He was
reared and educated in his native State.
After passing through the public schools
he attended and graduated from the
Cleveland Medical College. In his early
practice he spent three years In Indiana
and later removed to Omaha, Neb., where
he followed the practice of medicine for
two years. Later he removed to Michi
gan, where, ln 1857, he married Miss Lydla
Harmon.
In 1SS9 he came with his wife to Cali
fornia, locating first ln El Dorado County,
where he remained and practiced medi

The Seattle Real Estate Review makes
the following statement:
It has bf>en estimated by architects and real
estate a?*nts generally that about two thou
fand bulldlngn have bwn erectedâ and are now
in course of constructionâ In Seattle since the
first -' the year.
A careful perusal of the builders' con
tracts in Seattle for a month does not
warrant an Impression that Seattle is put
ting up very expensive" residences as a
rule. There was only one that cost as
much as $7500. One coat $6000 and one $,"000.
Ther* wero some that cost as low as $300,
and forty-two cost less than $1000 each.
Altogether there were recorded for tho
month eighty contracts, and the total
amount wns $170,255. Of this amount $C0.
000 waa for a railroad warehouse and
wharf, which leaves $110,255 for seventy
eight buildings owned by private person3.
all residences, which therefore averaged
a cost of $12S8 each. The Real Estate Re
view says:
There is no wave of speculation Jn realty
such as would occur In boom time, and prices
are rising slowly, but steadily. There is no
enthusiasm about buying and selling, but sales
are made upon a sober consideration of the
surrounding circumstances.

Owned in San Francisco.
The British ship Balclutha, which ar
rived In this port from Newcastle, N. S.
W., last Sunday, Is now a San Francisco
owned ship. The well-known house of J.
J. Moore & Co. are now the managing
owners and the vessel will run between
here and the colonies In the lumber and
general merchandise trade. Captain Hat
tield of the Balclutha is an old-timer in
Ban Francisco. He Is part owner of the
Lancing and his son-in-law is master of
that well-known ship. On his reappear
ance on the coast last Monday Captain
Hatfleld had to signalize his return. Ow
ing to the fog and . absence of all signals
the Balclutha was almost on top of th%
Farallon rocks before Captain Hatfleld
kne-w where he was. The lead, however,
told the olu navigator that he was close
to land and by the time the seals and
sea fowl gave a warning the Balclutha
was on the other tack and: the danger was
past.

Many Times in Peril.
Steward Patterson of the British ship
Windsor Park, now In port, has had a
rapid succession of thrilling. experiences.
On the voyage from Newcastle. Australia,
to San Francisco the cargo of coal caught
nre and It was only by eight days of hard
work that the ship was kept from being
destroyed. The sailors say they were
saved by the direct assistance of
Providence. Every man on the water
front remembers when the British
ship Breblock came Into port anre
and was beached at Sausallto. Patterson
was steward of her on that occasicm. The
British ship Durlsdeer, formerly the City
of Lahore, was wrecked on the Newcastle
bar a^year later. Patterson was steward
of her; The Ecclefechen, from Portland
for Liverpool, was dismasted in a gale
off the coast and had to put In here In dis
tress. Patterson was steward of her and
last of all he was steward of the Blair
more when she capsized In Mission Bay.
and had it not been for his presence of
mind and prompt assistance half a dozen
more men would have been drowned.
An Overdue Schooner.
The Americana, now out 10S days from
Caleta Buena for San Francisco, has been
unfortunate almost from the day she was
launched. At- the present time 25 per cent
Is being paid to reinsure her cargo of
nitrate, but the gamblers are not eager
to touch the risk. On her maiden voyage
the Americana made three starts from.

Bcn Badaracco, a blacksmith residing
at 1J0S Kearny street, reported last night
that a brutal assault had been made upon
bin by his 14-year-old son, aided by a
gang of hoodlums, at the comer of Mont-
Kompry and Valicjo streets. The oid rcan
tearfully related to "the officers at the
Calif ornia-Ftreet police station how his
own son had deliberately knocked him
down and kicked him la the chest when
he remonstrated with him and asked him
to give up tvil habits and evil company.
Afterward a number of the boy's compan

and continued the assault.
Uadaraeco did not desire to Bee one of
J;is outi children Iwliind prison bars, i>ax
ticularly on such a disgraceful charge,
hence he refused to accept the advice of
the officers and cause an arrest to be
made. He requested that the police talk
to the l>oy and try to lead him back to
the straight and narrow path. This the
othcers consented to do.
According to Badaracco's story his
con, Paul, ha* been keeping bad company
for some time past. The father tried to
reform him. but the boy refused to part
Ircm his eld associates. Last night the
old man four.d him at the corner of Va

a gang- of about forty boys and men. The
youth had a cigarette In his mouth,, and
this annoyed the father.
Badaracco stepped up to his son and
begged him to throw away^he cigarette
and come home. Instead of doing as re
quested the boy struck the old man a

Slinkey Is quite a character. His main
failing is liquor and to that is attributed
last evening's incident. He sports a
huge lump over his right eye that could
not possibly have been caused by contact

his attempt to beat the boat to Sausalito.

Supreme Court Benders an Important
Decision Against John T. Davis.
Husband's Liability.
A case involving interesting facts and
points of law was decided yesterday by
tho Supreme Court. St. Vincent's Insti

John T. Davis for boarding and clothing
the insare wife of the defendant from
June 2S, 1*31, to June 2, 1S94. In the Supe
rior Court of this city the asylum people
won. The Supreme Court, in discussing
the appeal, says there is evidence which
tends to prove that in 1S77 Davis took his
Insane wife from one institution In which
he had placed her and that within a day
or two thereafter she was found deserted
and destitute In a small town in Illinois.
She could give no account of herself, not
even knowing 1 her name or where she
came from. She was found in a hotel
with a trunk and could not have got there

The Sisters had her removed to their
asylum and Davis in his defense argued
that the complaint failed to show that- he

PLAY BY BRUSIE
SUNDAY AFTERNOON
One of the most important projects
which the Board of Education has in view
is a plan to enforce the compulsory edu
cation law of the State. The proposition
is at present in embryo, but it has been
seriously discussed at informal sessions
of the board, and the plan will undoubt
edly be consummated at no distant date.
The State law makes it mandatory upon
parents or guardians to send their chil
dren to school when they are between the
ages of 8 and 14 years, and violation of the
law is punishable by a fine. No attempt
has ever been made to enforce the law,
but plans will be formulated by the board
to use moral suasion in persuading par
ents to comply with its provisions.
In his report of the school census, June
1, 1900, Chief Census Marshal Elbert sub
mitted thev names of about 18,000 children
between the ages of 5 and 17 years who did
not attend any school In this city. The
age for compulsory education being be
tween 8 and 14 years of age, it is calcu
lated that at least 7500 children are being
kept away from school whom the law
says shall attend. It Is believed that if
some effort were made to carry out th'e
law at least 50 per cent of that number
could be added to the enrollment of the
local public schools. Even should 3000 pu
pils be so secured It would mean the addi
tion of a large amount of .money to the
school funds. For each pupil in average
dally attendance the charter allows $32 50,
and if the number were increased by 3000
it would Increase tho school fund by
nearly $100,000. .\ ,â;,.,.
The plan contemplates the employment
of officers whose duty it will be to round
up those children who are obliged to at
tend school and endeavor to prevail upon
their parents to comply with the law.
These officials would operate in a similar
manner to the - truant officer who exacts
attendance of pupils who play truant from
the school In which they are regularly en
rolled.- While the board is disinclined to
employ any more subordinates than It
possibly can, owing to the limitations of
its funds, it realizes that the system would
more than- pay for Itself in larger returns
allowed by the charter, owing to an in
creased attendance. â¢;.'
Chairman Mark when seen last night
said that the board would take the matter
up In the very near future.
"The proposition nan received some conl
sideration already," said Mr. > Mark, "and
I believe that some plan could be devised
whereby the attendance in schools could
be materially increased. The board does
not intend to-use harsh measures to com
pel attendance of children, but has. in
mind some gentle methods which will in
duce parents to send their children to
school. We will proceed cautiously in the
matter, as we know that considerations of
poverty prevent some parents from obey
ing the law. Their chfldren may be their
only means of support, and we would not
care to deprive them of that. Missionary
work in that direction might accomplish
a great deal, and the /plan will partake
somewhat of that nature. The project Is
in successful operation, in Boston but I
understand the law is more severe 'in that
city. Thirty-five patrol officers exercise
supervision over the children, and as a
consequence the attendance is nearly what
it should be.
Patrol Officers May Be Employed to
Use Moral Suasion on Parents
to Have Their Children
Educated.

Tou never thought of Mr. Whlttier as a
Quaker when you saw him. He wore, or
dinarily, a tall silk hat and black clothes,
varied sometimes with gay trousers or a
light overcoat, and In winter he was par
ticular to have his best overcoat turned
out with a fine Astrackan fur. But In
most other matters of minÂ£ and anise and
cummfn he was a careful observer of the
rules of his sect. He used the plain talX"
generally, sayfng "thee" and "thou," but
perhaps he offset it now and then by say
ing "plaguey" and he did bow to the ac
quaintance on the street and use the cus
tomary titles of Mrs., Miss or Mr. in ad
dressing a stranger. He would have said,
and did say, that he was a stout Quaker
in his principles; he undoubtedly was so x
In his prejudices; but the man of .war and
the man of peace were always at variance j
within him. 9
It was the man of war that made the
tremendous fight for the freedom of the |
slave, that did the work which rejoiced
his soul and which also won him his repu
tation. It was the man of peace who
afterward wrote the ballads and lyrics
and the songs of divine love that brought !
him the affection of almost a whole peo- â¢
pie. But the truthJs that Whittier loved
a fight as much as any frequenter of |
Donnybrook Fair, provided it was for a j
question of right or truth. There were
absolutely opposite spiritual inheritances
contending within him. There Â¦was. of
course, the Quaker with his love of quiet
pursuitsâ Thomas Whittier Is said to ;
have brought the first hive of bees to
this countryâ but also with his indignant
knowledge of what it is to suffrt- under
tyranny, wrestling with his conviction of
the ideal beauty of peace. Of this type
the poet's grandfather, Thomas, was a.
striking example, refusing the shelter of
the garrison house, making friends of the
Indians, who went and came in his house
as they would, his doors never barred and
he and his family remaining unhurt in
the midst of. massacre. Besides this
strain there was the well-known fire of
the Black Bachelder, one of the most in
teresting characters of the colonial his
tory. And then there was the hatred of
oppression and the determination to be
free in body and soul, that marked the
Huguenot, for among his ancestors were
the Feulllevertes. who translated their
name to Greenleaf on leavinp France, one
of whom was a lieutenant of Cromwell's
and whose coat of arms was peculiarly
suited to Whittier himself, as it bore not
only a dove and an olive branch, but the
helmet of a man-at-arms. It was well for
the world that this fighting blood did run
in Whittier's veins and made his heart
burn with power and his arm strong to
strike.
Whittier was born of the people. His
father was a farmer, whose few acres pro
duced all that his family ate or wore, as
the-4ew of Eden was sufficient to Eden.
The name of Whlttier was derived from
whlte-tawer, the dresser of skins for
gloves. The boy began work with last and
awl to earn his first money; and he re
mained near the people and with a heart
full of tender sympathy all his life. The
house in which he was born was of the
same comparatives-Order as the cottage in ,
which Burns was born, and as the Craig
enputtock ben and byre. It is a curious
freak in fate and fortune, although by no
means an unusual one, that he. who so
loved humanity and was virtually giving
his life for It should many times have been
hustled and assailed by mobs. It was his
pleasure to live near the people; although
he had accumulatedâ through generous
payment for verse, large sales of books
and the wise counsel of friends In invest
mentsâa very comrortable provision,
amounting to more than $100,000, yet after
he sold the Haverhlll homestead and came
to live in Amesbury his home was very
plain and his habit of life frugal, showing
an extreme simplicity of life and conduct.
You passed through a small parlor to en
ter his study, which was a pleasant room
opening on one side on a garden full of
shrubs and trees, and the glass door on
the other side giving a view of Powwow-
Hill. Here were bookcases and a desk, a
lounge and an easy chair, and on the walls
were a water color of Harry Fennls and
a painting of fringed gentians by Lucy
Larcom. Here by the open fire sat with
him from time to time Garrison and Phil
lips and the Fields and Bayard Taylor,
Emerson and Longfellow and Sumner and
Colonel Higginson and Stedman, Alice and
Phoebe Cary, Gail Hamilton, Lydia Maria
Child, Anna Dickinsonâ in fact, all the
personages of this era. But here also sat
on equal terms the village carpenter, the
drover and teamster. ,to Whlttier a man
being "a man for a' that."
Here he lived with his mother and his
beautiful sister Elizabeth, herself a poet;
and from here he went with them to the
Friends' meeting, preferring to worship in
the stillness of the little bare-walled place
lather than in any splendid temple where
the light filters through glass stained in
many colors and the organ rolls sweet
thunder, or In any fields or woods where
the loveliness of â¢ nature perpetually
brought his thoughts back to earth, al
though in his youth he had felt quite oth-
Essex County, in which Whlttier was
born, is full of leg#nd.s, stories of second
sight, of witches and witchcraft. o,f
haunted mills running by night, of phan
tom ships, of wizards who made the dry
bough blossom and innumerable others,
all of which Whittier made his own, and
in doing so won to himself the affection
of all who had a common interest with
him in the traditions.
Whittier was in his seventh year when
he first went to school â the district school,
whose teaching and whose appliances and
tools were very primitive. He was 14
when the world of poetry opened to him
with the songs of Burns. His earliest ac
quaintance with them came through an
old tramp, who after his refreshment sang
"Bonnie Doon" and "Highland Mary"
with great spirit. Later his first school
master, Joshua Coffin, read him several of 1
the poems. "I begged him," said Whittier,
"to leave the book with me, and set at
once to the task of mastering the glossary
of Scottish dialect at its close. ThL=Â» was
about the'flrst poetry I had ever read, i
with the exception of that of the Bible.
of -which I hatt been a close student, and
It had a lasting Influence upon me. I
began to make rhymes myself and to im
agine stories and adventures. In fact I
lived a sort of dual life and in a world c'
fancy as well as in the world of plain
matter of fact about mo."
Almost every one is familiar with tho
story of AVhlttler's elder sister. Map-,
sending to the Frrc Press, edited by Wil
liam L.loyrl Garrison, one of hlÂ» early
poems without his knowledge, of Garri
son's visiting him In consequence and of
Whittier's coming In from tho field to get
on his coat and shoos to see hi3 guest.
From the day of that momentous Inter
view Whittier stretched every nerve tt>
acquire education, walking miles to bor
row a book, losing no chance of cultivat
ing the gift of poetic expression. He was
a tall and slender -boy. very beautiful with
hia pale face and large black eyes; very
shy. with a love of fun and teasing: but
with a good humor and chivalrous spirit
that made every one his friend.
He was still very young whpn he be
came an editor and he spent many years
afterward in editorial A-ork. although he
worked on the farm between whiles to
pay off its debt. In 1833. when 25 years old.
he threw in his lot with the abolitionists
and both in prose and poetry for a Ions
time thereafter devoted his pen to their
cause. When he began his work, with
them it was a State prison offense to
teach a colored person to read. Now thera
aro 15,000 primary schools for colored
children in the South, to speak of no oth
er, and colored people themselves edit
more than 150 newspapers. What stormy
and what splendid days they were in
which he was. then an actor! Days in
which he and all his friends carried their
lives In their hands, but in which they
were animated by heaven-born purposes,
hearty companionship and heroic courage.
"I am here," said the president of one of
their meetings, in the face of a murderou3
mob, "and I will be torn In pieces before
I leave my place at your dictation."
Nevertheless. Mr. Whittier objected to
being called the war poet. "It is a mis
nomer," he said. "I have never written
a poem in favor or in praise of war. If
possible strike out the phrase, as I do not
wish to be represented as false to my life
long 1 principles." And yet In another of
his letters Whittier said: "I know noth
ing nobler or grander than the heroic self
sacrifice of Colonel Shaw. As he rode at
the head of his troops, tho very flower
and grace of chivalry, he seemed to me
beautiful and awful as an an^el of GoÂ«l
come down to lead the host of freedom,
to victory. I have longpd to speak tho
emotions of that hour, but I dared not
lest I should Indirectly give a new impulse*
to war." Yet when the bells ring on the
passage of the constitutional amendment
abolishing slavery, although he is at the
moment in the Friends' meeting, the mag
nificent "Laus Deo" springs to being as
he sees that
The cruel red of war
Blossoms white with righteous law.
And the wrath of nun is praise.
Mr. Whittler never lost his personal at
tractiveness In growing old. HI3 eye was
as fiery, his smile was as sweet, as In his
early manhood. David Masson used to say
that his eyes, full of dark flame, his Ara
biÂ«fn complexion, his sharp facial lines, his
height, his movement, all showed the Sar
acenic type, lie must have been agree
able to women, but if he ever had a love
affair nothing Is known of it. But "more
are the children of the desolate," and In
stead of the love of wife and children he
had that of all the people in his vicinage,
and he loved them In return.
"Why," said one of hla old neighbors,
"he's just as natural and like folks as can
be." He never went abroad; he shared
tho feeling of Xaarnan. Â¦who asked if
Abana and Pharpar. rivers >>i Damascus,
had not as healing waters as the Jordan.
He never held public office, content to
fight out his point of view at the post
ottice and the drug store. He never hesi
tated to fight if â¢ the glove were thrown
down. I remember now my consternation
when he met Judge Black, President Bu
chanan's Attorney General. In my draw-
Ing room, for you can imagine the instant
battle which each gave the other.
Mr. Whlttier went every summer to the
mountains, and late in. life he spent part
of every year with his cousins In their
sumptuous residence at Oak Knoll. Here
a number of his birthdays were celebrat
ed with much ceremony, and I recall one
of them with peculiar pleasure, because
he chose to have in letters of gold on his
big birthday cake a verse from, a poem
which my husband. Richard S. Spofford,
had addressed to him:
His life who loves his fellow men
Wins heaven before It closes.
He always returned to Amesbury for the
election, always holding the act of voting
as one of great solemnity. He died at
last, after more than eighty beautiful and
stirring years, in the village of Hampton
Falls, the road to which has been glorified
by one of his poems.
His funeral took place in his own house
and garden. The casket, half hidden in
Rowers, lay in the house: but in the gar
den, where rugs were laid and seats ar
ranged, the addresses and prayers were
made; and there flocked representative*
from all the world that loved him. The
autumn sun and the blue sky through tho
boughs of the great trees waving in the
soft warm wind, the faces of all the rever
ent throng, and especially the beautiful
face of his cousin. Gertrude Cortland. re
peating his own words as if just Inspired
with them herself, made it a scene not to
be forgotten.
His readers owe to Whlttier a debt not
yet fully acknowledged. If all facts con
cerning the historic life and manners of
New England were lost. they, could be
built up again from the pages of that Im
mortal Idyl. "Snow-Bound." andother of
his local poems. In certain of htS\verses,
too. one can find the whole scheme of sal
vation. He turned his song of the sword
Into a song of praise, a pastoral of peace.
His whole nature grew mellower and riper
with his lengthening days. After all is
said, one cannot but repeat what has been
said before, that love was the law of
Whittier's being: "The burden of his first
verses was the love of God and the bur
den of his last was the love of his neigh
bor."

court that If another continuance was In

should bo in court" to be cross-examined
if the prosecution wished, and as the pros
ecution bad rather pronounced wishes on
the. subject the 'physicians had an inter

Dr. Charles A. Clinton and Dr. E. P.
Howard were the witnesses yesterday.
Their testimony was to the effect that
Mrs. Craven had not left her room since
the indictment had been filed; that she
was seriously 111 and not able to stand
the strain of an arraignment and that any
court proceedings that required her pres
ence at this time would, if she had to
attend, seriously endanger her chances of
recovery. This was all brought out on
cross-examination. The result was the
continuance.
?The cases of George Simpton and that
of Adolph Sylva were also part of the
proceedings, for they came up on a propo
sition of ball. It was fixed at J10.000, the
bail to be accepted by any Superior

Valentine Khle. a private In v the United

escape from the Presidio Thursday. The
police and attaches at the Receiving Hos

him.
Ehle went downtown and exchanged
nil watch in a pawnshop on Pacific street
for a revolver. The pawnbroker, not

could nc.t shoot himself.
The insane soldier hired a room in a

thrte attempt? to kill himself. He first
tririi the revolver and each cartridge
failed to explode. Then he broke a bottle
itnd cut his wrists with the jagged edges
*=o that he would bleed to death. That
a!so failed and as a last resort he jumped
out of the window of hi? room. He had
a drop of about fourteen feet and escaped
with a pp-ainfd ankle.

The second civil service examination
under the new charter took place last
evening in the Girls' High School. Four
hundred and fifty persons, ranging in age
from 21 to 70 years, sat at the desks re
cently vacated by the High School girls
with squared elbows and expressions of
earnest attention and worked two hours
over the questions prepared for them by
the Civil Service Commissioners. The
prizes at stake were positions as ordinary
clerks In several departments of- the city
and county government. There were
twenty-five women candidates, none of
whom had reached middle age.
J. Richard Freud made all the announce
ments In the auditorium, which contained
300 eager contestants. He was assisted by
Secretary Moran. Civil Service Commis
sioners Qulnn and McCarthy and the
board of examiners, consisting of Judge
Coffey, L. R. Ellert and Charles Bund
schu, were on the front of the stage.
The tasks set were to write a letter con
taining at least 100 words pertaining to the
city government; to write a letter of 103
words addressed to the Civil Service Com
mission asking for a position as clerk in
some department, describing the duties of
such position and stating how they should
be discharged; solving ten problems in
arithmetic; copying from a mixed up sec
tion of the city charter, arranging it prop
erly and correcting something like forty
errors of spelling, punctuation, etc.
The contestants were required to score
75 per cent to be eligible. The results will
possibly not be known for a fortnight.
Each contestant having four sets of pa
pers there will be 1S00 sets to examine.
The 'schools having closed yesterday, the

persons of ordinary Intelligence to answer.
The more difficult problems in arithmetic
were to tell the tax rate, the grand roll
and amounts collected for city and county

mate the quarterly license tax on a fixed
amount of business, and also to fix the
tax rate on wagons, horses, etc.. at a fixed
valuation. The papers were signed at the

preserved, and the papers that go to the
examiners will be numbered only.

COFFEE DISEASES.
Minister and Young Lady Affected.
Ministers sometimes find they suffer
from the effects of bad habits as well as
ordinzry people. Rev. Mr. of
Athens, X. Y., had become greatly
rrnaciated from coffee drinking, which
produced stomach trouble and all of the
effects of overwork or poor nourish-
He quit the coffee and began flrinking
Postum Cereal Food Coffee.
His health began to improve and he
now weighs 151 pounds, an increase of
15 pounds over his former weight. This
improvement in health and strength is
jnoivn io be due to the use of Postum
~^od Coffee, by the fact that when he

~2. young lady who writes about the

ing greatly from "those twin diseases,"
'U-f^epsia and nervousness. "I knew
rfiat both of the diseases had their origin
in the use of coffee, arid while I was
lu'Iy aware of its injurious effects upon
my system. I was not willing to give it
up. for I did not know of anything to
take its place.
"Tea. I knew, was also injurious, and
as for cocoa, it lacked the "snap and go'
which can alone satisfy a coffee drink-
er's taste. About two years ago I pur-
chased my first box of Postum Food
Coffee- and quit the use of coffee. I
made Postum according to directions
and found I had a drink not only equal
to coffee, but far superior to it in many
ways. Since that time I. have used it
constantly. and find my general health
very much improved, and the "twin dis-
eases* gone.: I also send you the names j

CHICAGO, June 15.â At the beginning of the

were the following considerations of a bearish

rains for Minnesota and the two Dakotas. July

however. Tttv- bulls turned; to their great
friend and throughout the session received
from the Northwest the gloomiest brand- of

Northwest would pet Tialf a crop, others that

that the yield in the drought territory: this

NEW TORK. Jrne 15.â To find a parallel to
to-day's stagnation in the stock market lt
prould be necessary to go back to the period
of the last Presidential campaign. A num
ber of usually active stocks were not dealt in
to the extent cf a eincle share and lt was long
ifter noon before such speculative leaders as
Brooklyn Transit or Manhattan made their ap
pearance on the taj>e at all. There wus eonie
i'.latory speculation in Sugar during th* morn-
J-.JS at an advaiicp of about a joint, but that
fock fell lÂ»sck Into the rut cf dullness which
characterized the whole market. Large offer-
Inps of Northern Pacific began to appear near
2 o'clock at which lime the director* were as
(nub!!ns to take action on the eeml-annual
Â«3lvld<-nd. The Mock Ml Into quietude In tlxÂ»

right's level. It was not until after the close
of the market that tho announcement was
inade that only a 1 per cent dividend had
1 â¢ . -r. declared for the tlx-months period. The
T>ropoa<.J action of the directors seems to have
lx.-en kept a <-lose, cecrct eo that no ?â¢timate
can be formed of the effect of this action In
the Mock market. At the last dividend period
ti.e director* declared 2 jÂ»er cent on the crnn
ir.oa stock. 1 per crnt of which vai called
regular semi-annual and 1 per ccr.t extra.
Several weeks ago tlie etock was rushed up !

NEW YORK, June 15.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Extreme dullness
has prevailed In the market all week and
speculation seems to be at a complete standstill.
It Is, In fact, many months since the amount of
commission-house business on the New York
Stock Exchange has been at so low an ebb.
Investment values, are, lt is true, firmly held,
and the current prices In the bond market show
that Income-yielding securities of the better
class are In poor supply and that the demand
for them continues to be good, though by no
means active. On the other hand, speculative
trading Is left almost entirely to the profes
sional element In the Stock Exchange and the
current transactions represent little more than
an exchange of contracts between individual
elements In the board room. In euch quarters
there U on the whole a preponderance of bear
ish sentiment. It Is argued that the political
situation Is by no means certain, and that from
the time the convention of the leading national
Eartlcs are held until next November there will
e a general feollng of unrest In the business
and financial circles which can not fall to ad-'
versely Influence stock market prices. Rail
road earnings also naturally exhibit in some
"Cases decreases from the records of last year
and are, lt Is urged, likely to be Influenced by
the decreased activity of business and the prob
pect of reduced crops.- The drought In the
Northwest and what is considered a partial
failure of spring wheat throughout Minnesota
and Â¦ the regions to the westward have also
caused some revision of opinion In regard to the
presumed permanency o* railroad prosperity.
In fact, the action taken on Friday by the
Northern Pacific directors by declaring '1 per
cent on the common stock in place 0/ 2 per cent
dividend, which was confidently expected," show a
that such conservatism Is Influencing/the minds
of managers. At this time the. complications
In China, bringing with them a fear of a break
between some of the European powers or a
war between Russia and Japan, have held Eu
ropean - markets In check, added to which Is
the existence of a very serious state of affairs
In the Bsrlln stock and money markets, due to

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW TORK, June 15.â R. G. Dun & Co/s
Weekly Review of Trade "will say: A season
of declining prices Is never wholly agreeable
to businessmen whose stocks are losing their
values. Tet there are times when the
return to the highest prosperity In business Is
not possible except through readjustment of
pti^es. The highest prosperity the country had
ever reached, prior to the panic, was in 1S92,
with prices averaging not quite 75 per cent
of the average In 1860. After great depression
for several years the highest point reached
with last year's recovery was 80 per cent in
March, but the gradual yielding has already
returned the general average of prices to a
shade less than 75 per cent, practically where
It was with the highest prosperity In 1S92.
The output of Iron furnaces June 1 was
296,376 tons weekly, an Increase of, 2318 tons,
making the yield only 1638 tons less than at
the highest point ever reachedâ February 1.
But the Increasa of unsold stocks to 339,480
tons, about 94,000 tons In May, discloses a
larger decline than was expected In the new
business upon which nearly all the works and
furnaceB have now to rely, and reports that
works of considerable capacity have already
been closed this, month seem likely to be cor
rect. Within a week or two the labor or
ganizations and the employers will be dis
cussing new demands for higher wages and
shorten hours and the closing of many works
for lack of orders will have much Influence
about that time. Prices are gradually chang
ing, anthracite No. 1 to $20 and Plttsburg
gray forge to $17 50, and sales of bars are re
ported there at $1 50. After the closing of
furnaces and works has more nearly adjusted
present supply to the demand the fact that
many large operations are held back until
prices have been readjusted will have Its
proper Influence.
Wheat has been advanced nearly 3c with
accounts of extensive Injury to growing grain,
and the exports from Atlantic ports, flour In
cluded, have been In two weeks of June. 7.9S7,
167 bushels, against 3.626.S01 bushels lost year.
Pacific exports. 1,515,3S8 bushels, against 1.055.
512 bushels last year, and corn exports 6,000,462
bushels, against 5,812,959 bushels last year.
The active movement from the farmers seems
to discredit many accounts of Injury, although
receipts have been somewhat smaller than last
Failures for the first week of June were, in
amount, $2,118,813, cf which $l,C92,870 were in
manufacturing and $833,236 in trading concerns.,
Failures for the week have been 162 In the
United States, against 136 last year, and 21 In
Canada, against 18 last year.

NEW YORK. June 15.â Bradstreefs to-mor
row /will say: Measured by recent records and
recollections off business activity the present
between-seaaons Â¦ dullness seems specially
marked and the reactionary movement of
prices makes trade Â¦ look worse than It really
Is. Judged by such indications as railroad
tariffs and statistics of foreign trade the vol
ume of business doing is considerably larger
than a year ago, .when, it will be recalled,
money was cheerfully active. It is true bank
statements are considerably smaller than last
year's clearings, which undoubtedly included
much of a speculative character, this year al
most wholly absent and yet, outside of the
metropolis, bank clearings are heavier this
year than last. The cereal markets have held
the bulk of the advance shown last week on
the strength if | bad rrop reports, but foreign
recognition of conditions here has not sought
the direction of Increased takings. The acre
age remaining In wheat Is little Â¦ balow that
actually harvested a year ago and owing to
the favorable conditions In the Southwest and
on the Pacittc Coast the general average on
June 1 Is better than a year ago, but spring
wheat, owing to lack of rain, promises much
less favorable results. Wool is dull and on
the whole weak at the East, while good prices
have been secured In the West. Manufacturers
are not buying because their business is not
active and lower rates next season for men's
wear goods are predicted, though leading mill
agents will guarantee prices as late as October.
Lower prices for iron and steel have not
met expectations of causing a reduction In
output and Increased stock, though thla latter
feature apparently has been modified because
supplies .of high-grade pig iron are still
scarce, particularly so at the South. On the
other hand low grades are in plentiful sup
ply, with little demand. Further shading of
plr Iron quotations are reported East and West,
and the possibility of a 25 per cent restriction
of production is reported.. Under consideration
of leading Iron products a significant feature
Is the expressed desire of large ore consumers
that deliveries be held back. Rails and
structural steel are still well held, but there
Is talk of a reduction In prices for the latter
product. The other markets are dull and on
the whole weak.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4.678,029 bushels, against 4,230,
221 bushels last week, 2,794,471 bushels In the
corresponding week of 18&9, 4,396,787 bushels In
1S98. 2,547.319 bushels in 1S97 and 3.020,317 bushels
In 1896. . Since July 1. this season, the exports
of wheat aggregate 191.824.9S2 bushels, against
218,022.892 bushels last year and 225.272.S1S
bushels In 1897-98. .
The failures for the week In the United
States number ISO, as compared -with J84 last
week, 50 in this week a year ago, 207 In 1SD8,
226 in 1SS7 and 2G5 In 1896.
Failures In the Dominion of Canada number
23, as against 20 last week, 25 In this week a

SAILED WITH PERRY
TO JAPAN YEARS AGO
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, June 15.
In compliance with the direction of the
Board of Supervisors, District Attorney
Allen to-day brought suit in the name of
the county of Alameda against Assessor
Henry P. Dalton for the recovery of
$3825 15, commissions in the collection of
poll taxes alleged to have been illegally
withheld by the Assessor. Dalton's
bondEmen, Henry M. and Frank N. Dal
ton, are also made defendants In the
suit. They are the Assessor's sureties in
the sum of $20,000.
During the year 1899 Assessor Dalton,
according to the records of his office,
collected poll taxes to the amount of
lio.Sul. Of this sum but $21,670 85 was paid
to County Treasurer Feldler. The balance
of J3V3 15 was claimed and withheld as
his commission on the collection of the
taxes. As the money raised, by poll taxes
Is paid into the State treasury by the
county and Is apportioned to the State
school fund, State Controller Colgan,
when he learned that Assessor Dalton had
failed to turn- over all tne money col
lected by him, brought suit for the re
covery of the amount withheld.- A de
cision was rendered in the suit by the
Sacramento Superior Court that the
county and not the State was the proper
plaintiff In such an action.
At a meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors held two weeks ago the decision of
trie Sacramento court was cited, and it
was decided to instruct the District At
torney to bring suit In this county for
the withheld commissions.
The complaint filed to-day recites that
all of the money collected by Assessor
Dalton during the year 1S99 has not been
paid into the county treasury. The miss
ing amount is placed at $3825 15, and judg
ment Is asked for that sum. Issue is
taken with the Assessor's contention that
under the State law governing taxes and
taxation he is entitled to a commission
of 15 per cent for the collection of poll
taxes. It is stated further that demands
have been made on Assessor Dalton for
the money In question, but he still re
fuses to release the coin.

the nonchalant air of a man who

certificate, Loe swung hip pen with
fckJll and appended his American
ized signature with the grace of a
practiced pcribe.

OAKLAND ELKS
RECEIVE THEIR
EXALTED RULER
OAKLAND, June 15.â Attorney Harvey
D. Talcott has filed a peculiar answer
to a suit instituted against him some
time ago by Heaton & Hobson. a firm of
bill collectors. In an assigned claim of
Dr. J. Austin Miller for $50 alleged to be
due for services rendered. Talcott de
clares in his answer that the physician
is not entitled to the amount sued for,
as he was called "simply as an act of
charity." It is claimed that Dr. Miller
was called to attend a member of the
Talcott family at the instigation of a
West Oakland minister, who informed
the defendant that the physician was out
of luck and in gTeat need of money.
Attorney Talcott was greatly incensed
to think that his wife had been made a
defendant party to the suit, and ho in
cluded in his answer a paragraph read
lne as follows:
"Defendant has often been compelled
to rebuke the Heaton-Hobson combina
tion for their Ignorance and lawlessness,
and his only wonder is that the minor
children of defendant were not made
party to this action and replevin proceed
ings."

George Mirandette l Goes
Looking for Trouble
and Gets It.'
Waylays the Friend of His Spouse,
From Whom He Has Been Sepa
rated, and Receives Severe
Wound.
A mytcrlous shooting which occurred on
Dolores street about midnight Is causing
the sleuths of the Seventeenth-street Po
lice Station considerable worry. The vic
tim of the Fhooting is George Mlrandette,
a waitei in an O'Farrell-street restaurant,
who has been separated from his wife for
some time, and the shooter Is a friend of
the woman, although she declares film
docs not know his name.
Mrs. Mlrandette has been living with n
Mrs. Christiansen at 410 Dolores street,
and the husband, who Is employed as a
waiter in the Maison St. Germain, roomed
at lf>15 Clay street.
Last nlfiht a young man, whose name
the parties concerned are either unable
or - unwilling to give, called at Mrs.
Chrlstlanson s. and escorted Mrs. Miran
drtto and a party of friends to the
theater. They returned home about 11:30
o'clock and the mysterious young man
hade them good night at the door. He
had not left the house two minutes when
the occupants heard two pistol shots.
A few moments later a man. whom Mrs.
Mirandette immediately recognized as
her husband, crawled up the steps of tho
houfe, shot through the left leg below the
knee. Mlrandette was taken to the City
and County Hospital, where his wound
was dressed/ Ho was then taken to the
Seventeenth-strert Police Station and la
ter sent- home. Mrs. Mlrandette remained
with her husband and the stranger's-bul
let may result in reconciling their differ
ences.
The mysterious feature of the affair Is
the part played in It by the unknown
escort of Mrs. Mlrandette. The latter
claims to have met him but a few times.
Mlrandette himself refuses to give any
Information. Meantime detectives are
hunting high and low and it is probable
that a few hours will witness his arrest.
The supposition is that Mirandette
dogged his wife's footsteps last night,
tracked her home, laid In wait for her
escort and upbraided him. receiving in re
turn the bullet from the man's pistol.

TO SAIL.
ON THE CRICKET FIELD.
The second match of the second series
for the cricket pennant will take place
to-morrow on the ground at Webster
street. Alameda, between the Alameda
and California teams. The Alameda
Cricket Club will be represented by an
eleven picked from the following: 1 R. B.
Hogue, J. H. Saunders, J. J. Morlarty,
K. J. Croll, Harold Ward. Henry Ward,
G. J. Bauffh, V. Seebeck, W. G. Kortman,
E. J. Murphy, W. Richter and F. Stahl.
The California Cricket Clu*b will be repre
sented by a team picked from the follow
ing: Arthur Dickenson, E. G. Sloman, Lv
Schroeder, E. J. Loughman, W. Reeves,
W. Read, J. Bird, A. Willis, J. Guild. C.
Roberts. G. Schroeder and W. Bromfleld.
The California eleven, in playing against
the Pacifies on May 20. scored only 54
runs, of which L. Schroeder, not out,
made 26. On May 27 the same team scored
the same number of runs (54) against the
Alamedas.-J. Guild contributing 7 on that
occasion. The small score of 64 served to
win the match from the Pacifies, but fell
very much short of the Alameda total of
149 for a loss of eight wickets. However,
one of the chief charms of cricket, as of
horse racing. Is its uncertainty, and the
California^ may' "brace up" to-morrow
and make things look different. Dicken
son, Sloman, Reeves, Loughman, Guild or
Schroeder may easily get set and roll up
good scores. The strength of the Alame
da team principally consists In its pos
session of six or seven men who are like
ly to score double figures at the bat and
of two or three effective bowlers.
The committee, consisting of George
Theobald of the Pacifies, Henry Ward of
the Alamedas, W. S. McGavln of the Cal-
Ifornlas, and the secretary of the Califor
nia Cricket Association, will meet in the
secretary's office on Monday to discuss
the date at which the team chosen from
the city clubs shall visit- Lake County.
The team will be made up of members of
all the city clubs, as no one club could
get together eleven men who would be'
able to make the trip at the same time.
As the Lake County clubs do not play on
Sunday the difficulty of selecting a con
venient time is increased.
NOTEâ In the above exposition of the tides
the early morning tides are given In the left

second time column gives the second tide of

three tides, as sometimes occurs. The helehts
given are in addition to the soundings on the
United States Coast Survey charts, except
when a minus sljn (-*-) precedes the height,
and then the number given Is subtracted from
the depth given by the charts. The plane of

LONDON, June 15.â Ascot week's racing
closed to-day, and with seventeen wins
out of twenty-eight races, including such
trophies as the Royal Hunt cup and the
Ascot Gold cup, for the two Reiffs, Sloan,
Martin and Rigby, they are the talk of
the English racing world, while the su
premacy of American methods seems
finaJly and definitely established. These
Americans can make th<r . own terms
with English owners next year.
Of them nil 13-year-old "Johnnie" Reiff
excited the greatest Interest. His splen
did finish In the race for the Royal Hunt
cup Wednesday, when he won by a head
from Cannon, gained the admiration of
those who had hitherto doubted his abil
ity to control his mounts. This little
jockey, already earning at the rate of
15000 annually, has offers next year from
nearly every prominent English owner.
He received $100 for riding Koyal Flush
and rides In France Sunday for a fee of
Â£200. Johnnie's head seems unturned by
his success. He talked modestly at
Ascot to-day, saying:
"I am delighted, of course, with the
thirty wins my brother and myself have
each accounted for this year, but I am
looking forward to a winter in France,
where my brother and I expect to con
tinue our schooling.
"I won on Royal Flush because he is a
splendid horse.. Wlshard bought him for
SSOO and the Royal Hunt stakes alone
amounted to nearly $2500."
Sloan said to-day:
"I am going to the Continent to-morrow
for a six weelcs* holiday. That shows how
little I care about maintaining a riding
record, as long as I get satisfactory
mounts."
Definitely Establish the Supremacy
of American Turf Methods Over
Those of the English
Jockeys.

Jean Beraud and Imp Have Strong
Followings and John Bright
Will Come In for Some
NEW YORK, June 15.â Although there
have been race meetings in the metropoli
tan district thus far this year, the "real
thing" does not come until to-morrow,
when the Coney Island racetrack .will
.open with the Suburban as the chief event
of the card. Most of the horses on the
card for the Suburban have been to the
races several times this year and are tit
to run. They are trained to the hour and
with a good track, which seems likely,
the sport should be the best In years. The
list of entries with the probable jockeys,
so far as ascertained, is as follows:
Horsesâ Jockeys. . Wts.

Imp Taber 128
Jean Beraud Turner..'. 123

Petruchlo Rausch 102

Gulden Odom 100
Herbert Mitchell, 96
Sarmatian Henry 9a
â¢ This Is a choice lot and of them at least
three are counted upon as having a royal
chance to win. At the top of the list is
Ethelbert, winner of the Metropolitan
handicap and conqueror of Jean Beraud
In a match race at the distance. The game
Jean Beraud, one of the best two-year-
Olds of last season, a royally bred ani
mal and with a great turn of speed, is
next. That grand old mare, Imp, winner
of last vear's Suburban and the victor in
a lot of "campaigns, 'although her handling
has not always been of a careful charac
ter, is figured next. John Bright comes
out of the West with a big reputation and
is said to be very swift; Kinley Mack,
Â¦winner of the Brooklyn handicap this
year, but In the mud; Petruchlo, who -won
the Brooklyn Derby yesterday in fast
time with live ponds more than he will
have to carry to-morrow; and . Sarma
tian, the fast three-year-old, and others
more or less speedy are considered as fac
tors.
Ethelbert will probably be made the fa
vorite and there is also little doubt that
Jean Beraud and Imp will have a lot of
following, to say nothing of the men who
pin their faith to John Bright and the
lightweights. At the track to-day It was
declared on all sides that the prospects
were in favor of a race which would stand
,as a record for some years to come and If
the track record did not go it would be
strange. The track Is now In good con
dition and if no more rain falls will be as
fast as it ever was by to-morrow after
noon at 4 o'clock, when the bugle calls
the horses to the post.

HER CASE ON DEMURRER
Fails to Secure Order of Reinstate

/^{xnent.
The case of Elizabeth Bradley, who was
at one time teacher of drawing In the
Polytechnic High School, against the
Board of Education has been, closed on a
decision on demurrer rendered by Judge
Scawell yesterday. The case Is one involv
ing the right of the. board to drop a
teacher when the department to which shÂ©
belongs is discontinued. .
Miss Bradley brought suit some time ago
to have the board restrained from drop
ping her department from the curriculum
of the school, but In this she failed. Then
she brought the suit to have herself rein
stated in the department, regardless of
the fate of her specialty, but in this she
has also failed..' Her complaint was de
murred to on the ground of insufficiency
of facts and' this >demurrer has been sus
tained. She has been allowed time to
amend. ' . . - "
although It waa known that he had been
In poor health and that ho went abroad
for treatment at Carlsbad.- He was ac
companied by his wife and one daughter,'
who were with him when he died. Mr.

circles. He was president of the Stockton
Milling Company. He was 63 years old.

Smuggled Cigars on* the China.
Customs searchers seized 2350 cigars that
were being smuggled ashore from the
steamer China by Japanese passengers
yesterday. Each Jap had fifty or sixty
cigars and they would have been allowed
to land without hindrance had not the
suspicions of the searchers been attracted
by ihe Jact that all thepackages were of
similar appearance. Then one of the
Japs admitted that the cigars had been
given them by members of the crew to
smuggle ashore for them. ' " t
Bunko Man Sentenced.
Charles Mahoney, a well-known bunko
man. was convicted by Judge Conlari yes
terday of vagrancy and was sentenced to
six months In the County Jail. Mahoriey's
graft was to haunt the principal hotels
and pretend Â¦ that he was a wealthy
saloon-keeper â¢ from the country looking
for a probable purchaser. He had been
arrested a number of times previously,
but managed to escape conviction.

TEEEIIE is a great deal
of gambling carried on
with the law's sanction.
Far too much, indeed,
for tHe good of the youths and
weak-minded adults of this
city, who cannot resist wast
ing their hard-earned money
in a foolhardy effort to get
something for nothing."
This is an extract from the report niea
by the Grand Jury yesterday, prior to
that body"s discharge by Judge Bahrs.
The particular section it is taken from is
the one devoted to "social evils."
C. F. Lurmann. A. J. Vander White and
H M Whitly, the committee appointed
by Foreman Carmany to investigate un
der this head, are the authors of It. and
the section of their report devoted to
gambling denounces In equally fearless
and unequivocal terms the existence of
the various bucket shops and sure-thing
resorts which flourish so extensively at
the present time.
Jury Says "Barefaced Fraud."
The Cafe Royal, on Market and Fourth
streets, and the brokerage commission
house on Ellis street, east of Powell, are
particularized as the most prominent of
the undesirable gambling resorts. "Bare
faced fraud" is the expression used in
reference to the business of the Ellis
street establishment. The report further
characterizes this place as being a "raw
clock game veneered thinly with a cloak
of respectability."
"The police," the report goes on to
state "have several times arrested the
proprietors of this establishment, but the
courts, both the Police and Superior,
have dismissed the cases, the reason
given being that they were not conduct
ing a percentage game, and therefore not
infringing the law. The District Attor
ney has informed the Grand Jury that
such a gambling device is at the most
but a misdemeanor offense, and hence
not within their Jurisdiction."
Cafe Royal's Immense Profits.
Draw poker, as conducted in the Cafe
Royal, is characterized as being another
"sure-thing." The open games played
there have to make their profit out of the
players. The ordinary "urop" or "draw
out" would be unlawful. This difficulty Is
surmounted by a very palpable subter
fuge. The house sells the players at each
table two packs of cards an hour. Each
player gets a check entitling him to ten
cents' worth of refreshments from the
house whenever he chooses to take the
same. Each one must contribute fifteen
cents for each pack of cards. This makes
their expenses forty cents per hour
apiece. This is a heavy expense and
makes the game extremely profitable for
the house. It is only a matter of time
when the house gets nearly all the
money, the players having been given in
exchange cheap cards and refreshments
at a big profit.. ,
Nickel-ln-the-slot machines are also
condemned by the committee, it regarding
the most of them as "fixed" and so con
stituting "a bare-faced swindle." "The
doctrine of the greatest good to the great
est number," concludes this section of the
report, "demands that the machines be
abollshed altogether."
Lottery Gambling nourishes.
Lottery < gambling Is reported to be
flourishing, the efforts of the city to sup
press it being described as farcical.
The overcrowded condition of the City
and County Hospital is stated in that
committee's report to Â¦ be. "abominable."
Consumptives Â¦ are Indiscriminately mixed
in with other patients. The cubic
air ordinance Is- also violated. The com
mittee urges the erection of a new hospi
tal and recommends that $5000 be spent at
once in making â¢ the â¢ structure
habitable for the city's sick.
The location of the Harbor Hospital is
found, fault .with, the stench arising
from the mud beneath It at low tide being
dangerous to the health of Its permanent
staff. Â¦ - ' Â¦
The Chinatown committee reports that
no living case of bubonic plague has been
discovered. "The plague has," states the
report,- "evidently been sporadic, not epi
demic, and at the very worst has never
shown any indications of â spreading be
yond Chinatown."
Acres of Park Trees Dying.
â¢ The committee on' parks recommends
the construction* of a refreshment booth
at the present bicycle rest in Golden Gate
Park at a cost of about $25,000. Three hun
dred acres of trees to the west of Straw
berry-Hlll are said, to.be dying for lack
of fertilization. The Board of Supervisors
1b petitioned to make an extra appropria
tion in. the next budget; to provide some
means of saving the grove, many of which
could not be replaced without great ex
pense. The inside parks, namely, Jackson
Square! Holly Park and Franklin Park,
are also suffering from neglect due to
lack of funds.
rt The final report states that a great Im
provement is noticeable in and around the
City Hall. -It is -recommended that, the
ordinances prohibiting indiscriminate ex
pectoration, leaky sand and
garbage' wagons be more stringently en-
Forced . than at present.

Opusvich Charged With Homicide.
Coroner Cole. held an inquest yesterday
.upon the body of John Petrovich, who
was shot and killed a few days ago by
Vido Opusvlch. The testimony of Morgue
Surpeon L^land was that the wounds and
powder burns on the head and face of the
Â¦<Jpad man Indicated that there had been a
hand-to-hand struggle. Opusvich wept
Â¦copiously during the proceedings. The
Jury returned a verdict that Petrovich
came to his death from gunshot wounds
Inflicted by Vido Opusvich.
Gi r* ORE than 2000 people to whom the
//y/\ Nevada law figuratively has said
II h\ i\ "You are to sit opposite each
other at table for the rest of
your natural born- days," did not enjoy
their breakfast yesterday morning. They
read the morning papers, and either con
cluded that Judge Belcher was a wretch
and that Providence was against them,
or that they were playing in splendid luck
and would be spared all the annoying de
tails of a former experience.
The entire community felt the disturb
ing results of the Belcher decision. To
some homes It brought tears and bewail
lngs; to others thoughts, perhaps, of Joy
and freedom without the painful draw
back legally known as alimony, while in
the homes that it did not materially af
fect it brought the perplexing social prob
lem. "Ought we to visit them?"
Out at the "hall" all other subjects were
put aside In favor cf the absorbing Bel
cher decision. Lawyers gabbled about it.
The civil servicers discussed it with as
much interest as though each individual
one was a Reno minister. Laymen stood
around and pointed to the moral and im
moral side of It. And though all agreed it
was law and good law, they argued to a
man that it would not stand before the
Supreme Court. Should this highest au
thority support Judge Belcher's decision
the trouble that would ensue would be
appalling. There are feelings to be con
sidered. It is said, and sentiment Is to take
a hand in the matter.
Simmered down, all* the opinions ad
vanced in the matter amount to this: "To
do a great right do a little wrong"; and
the little wrong the Supremo Court will
be called upon to do will be to reverse the
Belcher decision. Many of the Reno
couples under the existing law are ripe
for a marriage that may with all legal
requirements be celebrated in this State.
However, there was no rush yesterday for
"Cupid" Danforth's little permit slips, al
though many a hope-to-be-a-Reno-bride
packed away her trousseau in lavender or
camphor.
Another phase of the decision is the
possibility of a felony charge being law
fully lodged against the previously di
vorced half of the Reno-mated couples.
If the Reno marriage is not recognized
by this State, then the party on whom the
Reno law so kindly smiled may be cited
as living in open shame with the party to
the Reno-made contract, and that is a
State prison offense.' As to the second
party to the contract, he or she is guilty
of bigamy. Therefore it will be seen that
the Belcher decision means more than
simply putting the Reno minister out of
business.
Eugene Deuprey, with the many vagar
ies of the law at his finger tips, is by vir
tue of the Reno accommodation once more
a benedict. But Deuprey is not disturbed
at the Belcher decision. . Neither is the
lady whom Reno declares to be Mrs. Deu
prey.-
"I'm not the least bit troubled or an
noyed," she said.
"I'm not criticizing the Judge," said
Deuprey, "but I consider my Reno mar
riage holds good. It was solemnized and
in the most > solemn conditions, and I
have not the slightest doubt as to its
binding qualifications."

The reception-rooms of the Women's

In closing the final report the Grand
Jury heartily indorses the recommenda
tion of one of their predecessors that the
powers of the body should be strength
ened by the Legislature. This Is quoted
from a former Grand Jury's final report:
"The Grand Jury is condemned by the
public for failing to do that which it is
powerless to do, no matter how anxious or
willing, and is held in mockery and con
tempt by many who should fear it most."
Tha Grand Jury Just discharged has held
twenty-four regular and five special meet
ings. Thirty cases have been considered,
of which eighteen were ignored. Six were
referred to the District Attorney, with the
request that four of them be brought be
fore the law courts, and that two be pre
sented to the next Grand Jury. True bills
were found lii six cases and Indictments
presented against eleven individuals.
The report contains a complaint con
cerning the petty quarrels which are
brought before the Grand Jury without
knowledge of the District Attorney. It Is
claimed that much valuable time has been
thus Â¦wasted.

! DON'T know the name of the game
and furthermore I don't much care.
You may call it what you like, stud
horse poker or anything you have a
mind to. All I know is that I very nearly
lost Â£26 by it and I was a fool." All this
In a single, long English breath, full of
British accent, came from the Hon. Ran
dolph Berens last night In the court of
the Palace Hotei as he related the Btory
of his first gambling adventure in San
Francisco.
George Brown, alias "The Kid," found
Berens, a tall, sandy-whiskered Londoner,
very easy game during the afternoon. The
"Kid," with three confederates, intro
duced the Englishman to stud-horse poker
and but for a series of accidents would
have netted Â£26.
"Yes. I was a fool," repeated Berens,
seeming to have a loving fondness for the
words. "Had anybody said I Â¦was green
or a fool before I landed in San Fran
cisco I. might have resented it, but now,
don't you know, I would pat them on the
back and say: 'Right you are, old fel
low.'
"You see It Â¦was this way. I was sitting
in the bar enjoying my brandy and soda,
when this man approached me and said;
'Hello, Berens.' He was a nice young
fellow. Of course I didn't know he was
a blackguard. It's not my business, you
know, to ask every nice young fellow If
he is a blackguard, is it?"
"Of course not," said somebody.
"Well." continued Berens, "he seemed
so plausible that I thought he really
wanted to do me a favor and we walked
up the street. I was on my way to Col
onel Arthur's office at the Klondike Gold
Company's. This fellow suggested a quiet
little game of poker In a quiet little place
and I Just felt like It myself. We walked
up the- main street a few squares and
then went up a tall staircase. Xo. there
was no lift. I wish there had been for
I was out of breath, you know, from the
steep climb. There were three doors at
the top and we entered one. Now isn't it
singular there were three men in the
room also?"
The crowd nodded acquiescence.
"After introductions," the Londoner
went on. "we sat down and played. It
was the most peculiar game of poker I
ever saw. I know the honest game very
well, don't you know. I learned it at
the Alhambra, in Spain, from an Ameri
can. Queer, isn't it? American In Spainâ
rather an odd combination.
"Well we each took a card, the face of
which was turned down. I had a splen
did hand after a few distributions; a pair
of aces and a pair of knaves. But it was
not the best one, for one of my fellow
players' had three sevens, and according
to the laws of the game he won." t
"Did you lose much?" asked an eager
eyed listener.
"Oh, I gave him a Â£2 piece In American
money," replied the Queen's subject, "and
told the man who took me to the place â
he was not in the game â to come with me
to the hotel and I would give him a check
for the rest, Â£26, don't you know. I made
out the check on Martin & Co.'s bank in
London. I handed it to this man and
he took it and away he ran."
Frank Cummings, clerk at the Palace,
was standing In the court at the time
and having learned of Berens 1 experience
gave chase. In his youth, several years
ago Cummings' breast was all aglow with
medals won as a sprinter. On Stevenson
street, near Third. George Brown was
brought to bay by Cummings and Officer
Mullins. The swindler was arrested and
booked at the City Prison.

Peter W. McGlade came up for sentence
before Judge Cook yesterday morning,
but he was not sentenced, nor will he be
tor some time yet and perhaps not at all.
Hia attorneys ros.de a motion for a new
trial, based upon alleged misconduct of
the jury, and it will not be the fault of
the jurymen if be does not knock out
their verdict and come up again, primed
with the prosecution's line of proof and
ready to make a better fight next time.
The misconduct of the Jury is not tiie
only cause alleged; there is also a. charge
of misconduct on the part of the District
Attorney and his deputies in having said
what they thought about the trial and the
* case against the prisoner and there are
aJso a few minor errors in the trial cited.
But the principal cause is misconduct of
the Jury.
The court ordered the Jurors not to read
In the papers the reports of the ca/se un
der consideration; they read the papers
evidently when they pleased and now
three of them come Into court and swear
that they became indignant at what they
read. The court ordered them not to con
sult together about the case unt'Â»I it had
been placed in their hands. Th*;y disre
garded this and not only discus:^d what
the papers were paying of the "trial, but
they went so far as to take one paper
Into the Jury-room with them and read It
aloud and discussed its comments after
the case had been submitted. And they
â¢were warned that Just 6uch acts as this
would nullify the city's efforts to secure
a conviction by invalidating 'Jie verdict
should it be rendered against t he prisoner.
The only charge the papers made was
that, by the method of lu drawing, the
Jury was open to the susplcicn that it fa
vored the prisoner. It bas probably fa
vored him to the extent of Â»i new trial.
The facts in the motion for the new
trial date back to the time the prosecu
tion moved that the jury be discharged .on
account cf alleged Irregularities in the
drawing. The defense Vigorously op
posed the motion and the court refused to
crant it. In the meantime three of the
Jurors asked to be excusoi from serving
on account of their comments, but their
request was denied. Tfrie newspapers
commented on the lrreg-u larltles alleged
and they were generally taken to mean
that if euch things had been done they
had been done to serve the prisoner, as it
could hardly be supposed that they were
done for the people. It Â¦was these com
ments that found the joimts in the jurors'
armor and three of them started forward
to declare that they could not serve after
such an accusation.
They served, however, and the verdict
Â¦was one of â¢â¢ETiilty." It was rendered
after such Irregularities, however. It is
the general supposition that It will not
stand. The irregularities were of the
jurors' own making. They could not be
ignorant of the fact that such doings
could redound only to the prisoner's
benefit. A verdict cf acquittal would
have to ttand and a verdict of "guilty"
would be the only one affected.
Affidavits in support of the motion from
J. P. Williams. Jchn Corbett and Harry
F. HcGurren, the righteous jurors in the
case, were read. They all recited the
derelictions of tV jurors and how they
had outraged all law by reading papers
and discussing them and by the reading
aloud of one article after the case had
gone to them, for consideration. There
was no mention in the affidavits of the
Judge's warning and instructions. They
dealt only with the flagrant irregularities.
Then an affidavit from McGlade was
read. It set forth the same facts, but
they camÂ© with better grace from him
than they did from the Jurors. He claim
ed that he had been injured by the mis
conduct arf the jury to the extent that he
cid not receive a fair trial.
The misconduct alleged against the Dis
trict Attorney and his assistant, Mr. Deu
prey. oor.sistfd in telling a newspaper
man. James Donohue, some facts about
the irregularities of the Jury. Donohue
was pot on the Etand, but he would testify
to but little.
In reply to the affidavits of the jurors
and the prisoner. Mr. Deuprey said he
would only submit the notes of the re
porter referring to the charges against
the integrity of the Jury made by the
prosecution and opposed so vigorously by
the defense.
The Judpe added that Wiliams had
Â¦come to him tbe day after the first publi
cation objected to appeared and asked
to be excused from the Jury on the ground
that he was looking for a position in the
city sen-ice and he feared that after the
comments that had been made his
chances would be impaired. The motion
'was then submitted.
. The defense also submitted a motion to
arrest Judgment on the ground that the
Indictment was insufficient and then the
case went over until Monday, June 25, to
give the District Attorney time to prepare
tome affidavits on his side of the case.
They Read All About the
McGlade Case in the
Newspapers.
