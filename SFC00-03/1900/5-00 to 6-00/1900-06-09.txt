the latest telegrams to reach London
were filed. The Chinese troops, however,
had killed many Boxers, according to
some reports, while another account had
the Government soldiers sorely defeated

Apparently, the legation guards have
not yet tak^n a hand in the fighting, but
they" are ready, to do so at a moment's
notice. The Boxer movement affects
tome hundreds of square miles. â¢

Powers in Perfect Concert.
The representatives of the powers are
Ft'.ll acting in perfect concert, which ap
pears for the present to give the Chinese
Government ample chance to put" down
the disturbances alone.- The Tientsin cor
respondent of the Daily Mail, telegraph
ing June 7, says:
"For the last three days the whole
community of Tientsin has been prepar
ing to deftnd itself against an expected
ettark by the Boxers. There is a con
tinual influx of refugees from the sur
rounding jcountry. who are now crowding
the city. This increases the excitement.
Nearly all the villages surrounding
Tientsin are Joining the Boxer move
ment, which is taking more and more
a fanatical character.
"Parties cf foreigners when approach
ing the villajjea are driven back by armed
bands. Yesterday the Chinese troops
were ordered to ilachang, on the Grand
Canal, within twenty miles of Â¦â¢ which a
large body of Boxr-rs are reported to be
collecting. Attempts to re-establish the
regular working of the Poking-Tlentsin
railway have hitherto proved futile.
Every night the Boxers set fire to the
Eleept-rp and ihe woodwork of the bridges.

ing.some ground for hope that the Gov
ernment would change its policy. Now
arrives the intelligence that Nieh's troops
have- been ordered to return to camp.at
Lu Tai, and that their action has been
condemned. The Tsung LI Yamen, how
ever, denies the iruth of the latter state
ment. But the denials of the Tsung Li
Yamen are never convincing. If it be true,
the news must fco regarded as serious.
"The American Missionary Conference

Kinley appealing for protection and as
serting that the, missionaries at Pao Ting
Fu and other places are in extreme dan

have everywhere been burned and that

"The- serious condition of affairs' at

telegram saying that the French Consul

"The Boxers burned a Russian chapel

Minister Conger at Peking also has been
heard from to-day. Â¦ His message to the
State Department said there was no im

instructions. It was not deemed proper
by the officials to indicate upon Just what
point Mr. Conger ;needs advice, but there
is an intimation that he .wishes to know
to what extent 1 he is to ; co-operate with
the '". diplomatics representatives of the
European, powers at Peking.
Secretary Hay took the message to the
Cabinet meeting.
The State Department is steadily pur
suing the line of policy laid down at the
beginning of this; Boxer. trouble of avoid

be absolutely necessary for the protec

cially It Is determined : to; avoid, commit

withstanding the : ominous news conveyed
in Admiral Kempff's. cablegram;, it seems
entirely probable that Minister " Conger
will be directed to . stick i to the > same line
of policy which he has pursued'up to this

Hacked to PieceB TJnder Circum

LONDON, June 9.â The Peking corre
spondent of the Times in a dispatch dated
June 7 says:
"Partlculars received here show that
Messrs. Norman and Robinson, the mis
sionaries, were hacked to pieces under cir
cumstances of revolting barbarity. The
Chinese- Government cannot be exon
erated from the charge of complicity In
these murders. From the beginning their
action .will bear only one interpretation,
namely, that of approval of the anti
foreign movement which has had these
results.
"The Government has delegated as a
commissioner to Cho Kau and Pao Tins
Fu.'the chief centers of the Boxers, to
Investigate and report, a notorious antl
forclgn official, who Is known to be In
pymapthy with the Boxers.and who was
the director of a mining and' railway bu
reau that was founded to thwart all rail
way and mining development."
The Pekinff correspondent of the
Tirses. telegraphing June 8. says:
â¢The news that General Nieh's forelcn-
GREAT seriousness marks the situation in China. A horde of "Boxers" is ex
pected to attack Tientsin to-day, according to advices from Admiral Kempif. They
i'ought the Chinese soldiers yesterday near the city. Twenty-five foreign war
ships are now lying off Taku, and senior naval officers, lacking the Russian, have
made plans for joint action. Captain McCaHa of the Newark commands the American
landing party and may direct joint operations against the "Boxers,"
Problems of the Chinese situation occupied the Cabinet session at Washington
yesterday. Protection of American 5ives and property without aiding any other na
tion's ambition will be the policy of the United States, and Minister Conger has been
instructed on that line.
London heard a report last night that notes were passing between France, Great
Britain and the United States relative to joint' action 'to restore order in China.
Hundreds of Christians have been slain by the fanatical' "Boxers," arid two British
missionaries were hacked to pieces under circumstances of the most revolting barbarity.

GERMAN WARSHIPS
AT CHINESE PORTS
BERLIN, June 8.â A German Foreign
Office official made the following . state
ment to a representative of the Associated
Press: . â¢ V
"The Foreign Office has had no otlicial
communication from China for two days.
Of the two wires connecting with Peking
one has been destroyed.. It is of the ut
most importance to. the, powers to "pre
serve the other. It ought not to be dim
cult for the powers to kqep open the rail
way-to Peking. The Foreign Office, does
not know of , any further plans by the
powers to land . marines. , 'We , have heard
nothing to confirm the statement thatithe
Empress Dowager sideb with the Boxers." 1 .
From other sources it was ascertained
pean Governments respecting the Boxer
trouble. Thus at Taku Admiral Kempff
is acting, in a similar manner with the
commanders of other naval vessels as
sembled, although his orders_are subject
to the approval of no one. At Tientsin,
forty miles up the river, which the ad
miral expects to be attacked to-morrow,
the foreign naval commands are acting to
gether.
It is said that In case of an emergency
involving jeopardy to the lives of for
eigners the United States forces at Tien
tsin might even be directed in th. ir gen
eral movement, by the senior naval officer
ashore, even though that officer should
happen to be a German, a Russian, a
Frenchman or an Englishman. This tem
porary subordination of authority might
be brought about, and in fact would exist
solely through a military exigency. If
Tientsin is to be attacked by a vast horde
of Boxers it is entirely conceivable, ac
cording to military practice, that a suc
cessful defense of the foreign lives and
property in the city can, be. maintained
only through the assumption of the com
mand of the foreign naval forces by one
competent officer; too many captains may
mean defeat. In view of this possibility
thft assumption of the command of the
American forces ashore by Captain Mc-
Calla may be significant.
It Is an" unusual course for a captain of
a ship himself to take command of a
landing party, as has been done by Cap
tain McCalla. His rank would correspond
with that of a colonel qf marines, and
it may be that he would himself be the
senior ofllcer at Tientsin and thus be
obliged to assume command of the defense
and direct in a general way the operations
of the European naval parties landed
there. "
The naval officers here are confident
that Tientsin proper is not inÂ» particular
danger. The gunboat Helena will soon
have the town under her guns. and there
are believed to be three foreign warships
in position to co-operate.

Advocating the joint action of England
and Russia, the Times says: "It is in
fact .to the effective and cordial co-opera
tion of England and Russia that we must
look for speedy relief from the present
anxieties. It. is evident that the other
powers interested, are quite prepared to
take part in any-common and concerted
action and although some may be less
eager, than, others the spectacle of Eng
land and Russia agreeing to act together
arid resolved to act vigorously would do
more than anything else to" bring them
all Into line."
MISSIONARIES HEARD FROM.
NEW YORK, June 8.â The anxiety
which has been felt in regard to the Pres
byterian missionaries in the Peking dis
trict was partially allayed to-day by the
receipt. of a cablegram from Dr. John W.
Henry, one of the board's oldest mission
aries in China. The board cabled on Tues
day for information, and the reply read:
"Still danger."
This is taken to indicate that no se
rious depredations have been made as yet
by the Boxers. The Presbyterian board
had fifty-eight American missionaries in
the Shantung province. The American
board has also received a cablegram stat
ing that all American missionaries are
well, but that the Government is demoral
ized and advising that help be requested
from the State Department.

YOKOHAMA. June 8.â More serious
from a Japanese point, of view than the
rising of the Boxers in China is the sud

the result of the protests of Japan against
the torture and execution of political
prisoners by the Korean Government. The
Korean Emperor absolutely refuses to

THREE FILIPINOS
CONVICTED OF MURDER
General Otis Commutes Their Sen
tence to Twenty Years' Ijn-.
prisonment.
WASHINGTON. June 8.â Newspaper re
ports just received at the War Depart
ment show that three natives were con
victed by a military commission of hav.*
ing murdered Quartermaster Sergeant
Albert Voltrie, Company K, Thirty-ninth
Volunteer Infantry, at the Barrio of Bag
bag, near Tanuana, in the province of
iiatangas. on February 2 and were sen
tenced to death by hanging.
In passing upon the case General Otis,
as the rtnai reviewing authority, said that
the findings of the commission were fully
sustained by the evidence and that the
ffeath sentence imposed by it had the ex
press sanction of the laws of war. He
was. however, unwilling to direct the exe
cution of the sentence, as he believed that
the accused were Influenced to commit the
crime of which they were convicted by
local guerrilla chiefs, who. he said, were
the principal criminals in the affair.
Moreover, he said, the prisoners were
ignorant of the legal consequences of
their act. Therefore he commuted the
sentence In each case to twenty years' im
prisonment at hard labor in the Presidio
dn Manila.
"The clemency herein exercised,"^ said
General Otis, "will not bÂ« considered a
precedent to guide or influence the future
actions of the reviewing authority upon
proceedings of military commispions of
such gravity as the present one and the
occasion is taken to announce that in the
judicial determination on questions of
guilt which involve the responsibility for
the awful taking of human life the full
rigor of the law will be inflicted when
rightfully Invoked by legally constituted
courts." .

CITY OF MEXICO. June ?.â The Offi

says: Some days ago a newspaper of this
city published an article taken from a
border newspaper to the effect that the
American warship Ranger, had threatened
to bombard Port la Paz. Lower Califor
nia, on account of a criminal suit pending
against two Americansâ Robert and Ar
thur Grigsby. The truth is that there was
no such threat, but merely a courteous
request from the "captain of the Ranger
to the Jefe Politico of that district to be
informed as to the case, the parties con
cerned having made complaint to him.
The Jefe courteously declined to fur
nish the information and reported the
matter to the Department of Foreign Re
lations, which, through the American em
bassy in this city, complained of the con
duct of the captain, who could have noth
ing to do in a matter now_ pending in the
form of a habeas corpus before the Su
preme Court of the nation. The Govern
ment of the United States declared that
the request of the captain in question
(whose ship it seems went to LÂ»a Paz on a
geographical mission) had not- been the
result of instructions given to him and
tnat his action was disapproved and the
occurrence sincerely regretted. It was
also stated that an investigation would be
made Into the acts of Captain Field and
the American Consul at La Paz and that
the result would be communicated to the
Mexican Government. When this takes
place the entire correspondence in the
case will be published.

IN THEIR CONTEST FOR A DIAMOND MEDAL TROPHY
The rooms of the San Francisco Settle
ment Association at 7+0 Bryant street
were crowded yesterday with visitors who
viewed the work of the members of that
organization. It was the annual exhibi
tion of the association and the splendid
results achieved by the workers during
the past twelve months were shown, la
all their variety. The Mothers' Club had
a pretty exhibition of useful things la
knitted goods and wearing apparel. The
Girls' Club was represented by clever
water colors, artistic need'e-work and
the results of their studies in civil gr.v*ra
raent under the direction of Miss Jessica

rpaclous building the uoys showed their
handiwork to admiring visitors. Mat3.

numerous other useful articles were evi
dences that their little hands had been
directed in proper channels. The cooking
section baked the sweet cakes that were
distributed at the evening's reception and
the singing class furnished the musical
entertainment.
The San Francisco Settlement Associa
tion is not a charitable organization. IC
was formed nine years ago by a number
of people who believed In bringing: the
working classes together and teaching
them the value of keeping busy. The
small boy was invited to come off the
street In the evening and learn something;
to his benefit. The little fellows became
Interested in the project and before a
month had passed a number of classes
were formed. The lads were taught setting
type, printing, molding, hammock-maklnc
and were given sound advice. Within
a short time a gymnasium was added to
the association and the little fellows
were taught how to develop their muscles.
Military companies were formed, baseball
nines gotten up and within a short time
tho boys' club became famous throughout
the city. The experiment worked so suc
cessfully that the mothers of thÂ© young
sters were Invited to come in and they
in turn formed an organization and met
once a week to discuss household prob
lems and learn the latest in cooking, knit
ting and sewing. The Girls' Club* was
added to the association and the working
girl was given every opportunity to edu
cate herself.
The exhibition yesterday showed tha
benefits to be derived from membership.
Only a small sum is demanded from tha
eldera for the support of the Institution.
A great many articles made by willing
hands find a steady market and the
money thus derived is employed to carry
on the work of the association. Mrs.

money. She has purchased a lot on South
Park and intends erecting a large house
for the settlement, so that all can be un
der one roof. At present the San Fran

determined last night to wrest it away.
They tried hard, but failed: Company

the second time won the meriaL Thc
company drilled with the precision of. a
rmchine. The toys acted In the various
military evolutions as if they were one.
In coiumii of fours, in platoons and in

without flaw. Every movement was

At 7:30 o'clock the League of the Cross
Band commenced a concert which con
tinued until nearly 9 o'clock. As soon as
the doors of the Pavilion were opened the
crowd began to flock in. The street in
front was black with a watching thron:;.
Inside were the sounds of music well
played, the tramp of drilling cadets eager
for the last trials before the contest, the
clash of sabers in friendly rivalry, th<>
bustle and confusion and voices of people
hastening to their seats. Then there was
a cheer which rang through the big Pa
vilion and echoed into the street. Major
General Shafter. with Ills aids. Captain
Morse and Lieutenant Wilson, had ar
rived and was being generously welcomed
as he was escorted to the reviewing stand.
In a few minutes the boys marched on
to the floor, passnig in review before
.General Shafter. They were a manly set
of fellows and well deserved the jyaise
which General Shafter pave as they
marched before him and saluted. Around
the Pavilion they moved each company
receiving the plaudits of its champions
until the last had passed from view and
the floor was cleared for the first drill
in the competition. It was given by Com
pany K of St. Paul's parish, under com
mand of Captain James H. Reilly. The
company drilled well and in a competition
loss suevere would have won. But it was
matched against two competitors of no
mean merit. Company L of Mission Do

with exceptional ability. Then came the
medal winner. Company D of Sacred
Heart parish, under command of Captain

ON THE PUTTING GREENS.
Though several of the well known Oak
land golfers are absent on summer vaca
tions, the Oakland Club is still manifest
ing considerable activity. Miss Dunham,
who is a fairly strong player among the
ladies, has returned from a visit to the
Kastern Suites. This afternoon there will
\if a ladies' tournament over nine holes, i
match play, on the Oakland links.
In iÂ« recrat competitions on the links
of theTan Rlfael Golf Club for the Coun
cil's cups for men and women, two well
known names do not appear â those of Mr.
and Mrs. K. Oilman Brown. R. G. Brown
has been absent from the city for several
days, but will return shortly. The Coun
cil's cup for men was won by E. J. Mc-
Cutchen of the Ban Francisco Golf Club,
and the Council's cup for women by Miss
Alice Colden Hoffman of the game club.
The Decoration day handicap tourna
ment on the link? of the San Rafael Golf
Club brought out an unusually large num
ber of competitors. The "greens" were in-
condition, and there was little
wind to interfere with the players. The
ladles' handicap- over eighteen holes,
medal play, attracted nine entries, the
winner being Mrs. H. G. Bundrem. with a
i-core of 124 Jess 36â f*S. The prize for best
gross score was won by Mrs. F. T. Grif
fith, with a score of 105. The men's
handicap over thirty-six holes, medal
play, attracted fifty entries, fortyyfive of
whom actually .took part in the tourna
ment. Hugh Slay made the first eighteen
holes in i& and the second in i*0,or a total
of 185 for thirty-Fix holes. J. H. Nicoll
ves second with a gross score of 1S9. J.
H. Xicoll and W. W. Stevens tied for best
r.ct score, ihe former's score being 189 less
2&â 1C1, and the latter's being 205 less 41â
The N. G. C. Encampment.
Major General Dickinson of the N. G. C.
expresses the opinion that the division en
campment was not called off by the com
mander In chief on the ground of econo
my, which has teen assigned as a reason
for his action, but in consequence of rep
resentations of the health authorities that
have led him to believe that the National
Guard might, at a moment's notice, be
requested to enforce quarantine regula
tions. He declares that the only saving
by doing away with the division encamp
ment would be the transportation of about
six hundred men from the southern part
of the State.
Several new faces will be. seen on the
local diamond this week. Prominent
among them will be that of Henry Reitz.
the star infielder, who was with the Bal
timores when they twice won the cham
pionship of the i National â¢ League. Reitz
has been playinp this season with jMII
waukea and has been doing remarkably
good work for the team. Manager Harris
is highly elated over his success in secur
ing Reitz. and he now thinks that* he has
a team that will play winning ball. He
will station Reitz at short, shift Riley' to
third and play Krug on the bench. : ;
. : The Oakland's will* also have two new
men. Ewing first intended'to fill Ham
mond's place with â¢ Charley ' Drews, but
he has secured a much faster man, he be
lieves. In'* the person ' of Mangerlna, the
Los Angeles catcher, who made a great
hit in the tournament games: at Central
Park some years since. He has been play
ing ball ever since and" Is in first-class
condition. ""Chiefs â¢ Borchers has also
been signed by Ewing, and will probably
pitch the 'Sunday game. The Oaklands
were badly in need of another twirler and
Borchers ought Â¦ tor lend strength- to the
team. \ The line-up for to-day's game fol

Richmond Wants Concrete Walks.
At the last meeting of the Point Lobos
Improvement Club a resolution was Intro
duced and carried requesting the Board of
Public Works to place six-foot concrete
sidewalks on all the streets and avenues
lying between Point Lobos avenue and
Lake street and between First and Sixth
avenues. At present certain sections of
the Richmond district have the old three
foot wooden sidewalks, which, being in a
rotten condition, are declared a nuisance.
President George R. Fletcher announced
his intention to go East for three months.
TAIL ENDERS
MOVE UPWARD
Oakland and. Local Nines to
Break the Ice of Defeats and
Make Advances.
The tide of victories for the baseball
champions turned last week when Oak
land won two games of the series j with
Sacramento, the third played on the Oak
land grounds resulting in a tie. The rea
son of both defeats administered to the
hitherto invincible Sacramento team was
the erratic pitching of Doyle. Both his
performances. Saturday and Sunday af
ternoons, were anything but high class,
and the way. he was batted over the en
tire Recreation grounds in these games
with the Dudes caused strange misgivings
in the fanatics that held him in high
repute. Â¦.* â¢
The second reversal, rather a sudden
surprise to all. was Uncle Hank's double
victory at Stockton. For many, a 'day
the local team has been celebrating a se
ries of unbroken defeats, and this ray of
gladsome light where utter gloom pre
vailed has aroused /he local team with a
portion of confidence. Then, again. Man
ager Harris is on the move to. strengthen
his team with famous old-time players.
The season is not so far advanced but
that with a timely pulling up the San
Francisccf nine might forge its way' into
the reckoning and be a party in the race
for the highest honors. ,
Oakland suffers a great loss in the de
parture of Schmcer and Hammond for
the northwest country. , The Butte team
will have these two men, in their: ranks
for the next four months and they will
probably not return to this city as: they
have been given good business, positions
in Butte. Hammond and Schmeer. stand
at the head of the Oakland batting col
umn ana their Â¦ work in. their respective
positions was - of the first order. Ham
mond's loss will be felt particularly, as
he steadied his team and was just the
catcher for the Oakland twlrlers. â¢ Dun
leavy will be brought in from right . field
to second, his old position; Francks going
to short. Ewing has signed Borchers,
who will alternate with Steffanl on the
slab/,:'/- ' Â¦ ' ' Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦â¢â¢" . â¢ Â¦ -Y,.':
â¢ The spurt made by the ,tall-endÂ« teams
last week succeeded in decreasing the dis
tance between themselves and the lead
ers The Sacramentos were caught at a
disadvantage, Doyle : not being in good
condition, and Hughes* being too 'careful
of his arm to attempt to pitch two games.
ANNUAL EVENT
ON THE COURTS
Tennis Men Are Preparing fop.
the Championship Tour-_
The usual ante-chamlonship tourna
ment scrap-^a - much ado^ about nothing
affair â occurred at the annual meeting of
the Pacific Coast Lawn Tennis Associa
tion during the week. It resulted, as it 1
always does, In the selection of the courts
at San Rafael as the location for the hold
ing of the championship singles tourna
ment of the Pacific Coast. There has al
ways been a disturbing element in the as
sociation, and this year bore no change
in | the condition of affairs.^' After much
useless and ridiculous altercation the San
Rafael courts were finally selected.
There is every promise that the cham
pionship matches this year will be as ex
citing and interesting as they were last
The entries will be more numerous and
the competition strong. Of course . the
tournament -will simmer down to a con
test between the Hardys and the Whit
neys. George Whitney, the present cham
pion of the coast, will have to fight the
Hardys for the continued possession of
his honors and prizes. The Oaklanders
are determined to give hard battle this
year and wrest the championship from the
San Franciscan. With this idea in view
the >Hardys will 'go through a : systematic
course of preparatory training to be In
proper condition for the event of th<-- year
â¢ The practice at the " California Tennis
Club has fallen off during the past week
on account of unfavorable weather. Next
week the real practice for the Fourth ot
July, meet will begin.. On Sunday, a num
ber of the cracks will go over to San Ra
fael to try the courts. -The two Whitneys
and the professor of tennis at the Califor
nia Club, Joe Dally, will be among the
party. -Â¦ . Â¦-â¢ .â¢â¢: : .ru, ; : - .-.;. : , - .

BURLINGAME EVENTS.
The members of Burlingame Country
Club are already planning outdoor pas
times for July 4. The programme as
now outlined calls for a pigeon shoot,
and a golf tournament; The former is
the second contest for the Frank J. Caro
lan trophy won last y*"ar by W. H.
Howard, and is open to members and their
guests who have shot on the club grounds
this year. The affair is a handicap at
twenty live pigeons.
The golf tournament Is for the Ponla
toweky cup, which was won last year bv
Miss Alice Moflltt, the brilliant repre*
sentatlve of the Oakland Golf Club. Miss
Alice Hoffman is considered the strongest
candidate for the honors this year, as
Miss Moffltt will probably, be an absentee.
For the members and their guests who
do not go in for the robust sports of the
field there will be an orchestral concert
on the clubhouse verandah during the af
ternoon.
Bookmakers in Court.
Bookmakers Corhett, Crowley, Schwartz
and Abrams appeared in Judge Murasky's
court yesterday to prosecute their action
for an Injunction to restrain Chief of Po
lice Sullivan from executing a threat to
close their establishments and confiscate
their, property. George D. Collins repre
sented the petitioners, while Henry Ach
represented the Chief of Police. Ach as
serted that there was no remedy for th.3
petitioners, as they were plainly violating
the law. Mr. Collins, however, differed
from opposing counsel and as the case
manifested signs of being long drawn out
Judge Murasky ordered a continuance un
til to-day, -i. >

others. In a 200-mile race .recently John Filmer's bird, registered R.374, flew at aft average spedcl of 133S yards per min

and 400 miles In a day is a record fly. The birds arc trained with the greatest care and attention. There Is a practical
side to the breeding and training of these. wonderful birds. The navy yard at Mare Island is equippel with a fine loft
and Is stocked with well-trained birds, which are used on Government vessels. During the war in South Africa they
have been found to be of. the greatest value. The birds were trained to return to a movable loft, the rirst time such a
thing was ever accomplished.

TO PLANT NEARLY TEN
MILLION YOUNG TROUT
THE annual replenishment of trie
trout streams of California will be
commenced by the State Board of
Fish Commissioners during the lat
ter part of this month. Nearly ten
million of the favorite game fish of the
anglers will be distributed in. the public
streams, where they may be taken at will
within certain restrictions fixed by law.
From the Sisson hatchery 500,000 Loch
Leven and German brown trout fry will
be sent to Tahoe, Donner, Independence
and Webber lakes? These are the only
places where these varieties will be plant
ed. In addition to the fry for the lakes
the Commissioners report having 1,000,000
rainbow fry and 3,000,000 Tahoe fry (the
Mykiss) for distribution in the various
streams. This work will commence about
July 1 and will extend over a period of
three months. \
The Wawona hatchery has been a suc
cess during the past season. The waters
of Yosemite National Park will be stocked
from this hatchery. The Yosemite is fast
becoming a favorite resort of the fly fish
ermen, the lakes In the vicinity offering
them great inducements to test their skill.
The distribution from Ukiah hatchery
this season will be a record breaker. Su
perintendent La Motte has over 2,000,000
steelheads to place in the near-by streams.
As these are the native trout of the Rus
sian River watershed - the benefits to be
derived from their distribution should be
great in the years to come.
Sims, on the Upper Sacramento, attract
ed fourteen well-known fly casters last
week, the party staying at the Souther
place. The sport afforded was poor. One
fortunate angler took with a fly a Im
pound German brown trout from one of
the big pools. Both brown and I^ch Leven
trout were planted in the Upper Sacra
mento three years ago. The plant was a
small one, and upon the advice of several
experts on fish culture the Fish Commis
sion determined to plant no more, as the
fish. were paid to be more predacious and
less game than the native rainbow.
W. F. Bogart and A. S. Carman fished
the Sacramento in the vicinity of Slatonas
last week. The weather was warm and
the sport poor.
A. C. Freeman and P. J. Tormey fished
the Big- Stony, in Colusa County, last
week. They drove from Willows and
camped at what Is known as the "Pole
Gate." They found the stream high but
clear and report fishing exceptionally
good. Mr. Freeman affirms he saw more
landlocked steelheads in the pools than
were ever there before. The Big Stony
rises on Snow Mountain, Lake County,
and runs northeast through Colusa and
Glenn counties, entering the Sacramento
near Orland. It is the largest western
tributary of the Sacramento. The Big
Stony Is pronounced one of the best. If
not the best, brooks In the State. There
are several attractive resorts for anglers
at different points. Among the best of
these are the Goulding place at Stony
Favorite Lakes and Streams of the State
Will Be Replenished WiÂ£h the
Game Fish.
Ford and Foutz Springs, some ten miles
up the Canyon from Stony Ford.
F. G. Sanborn and F. P. McLennon left
on Friday morning for Stony Ford. They
go in by Willows, picking up J. W. Shanks
at that point as a guide.
Stockton and local anglers have been
greatly interested in the arrests made at
Salt Springs Valley reservoir, near Mil
ton, Calaveras County, by Deputy Charles
Vogelsang of the Fish Commission. The
reservoir is one of the largest artificial
bodies of water in the State, being about
twenty miles in circumference. The dam
was built thirty years ago. Some four
years since the Fish Commission planted
300 adult black bass and 3000 small
mouthed black bass fry in the lake and
they have propagated remarkably. Some
large catches were made last year. The
people near the reservoir apparently do
not understand the law, which prohibits
the taking of bass between January 1 and
July 1 of each year. The arrests will go
far toward impressing them with the pro
visions of the law. The men were accom
panied by their families, but out of gal
lantry Mr. Vogelsang did not place them
in custody. One 11-year-old girl caught a
small-mouthed bass weighing two and a.
half pounds. When the season opens
some of the local anglers will test their
skill on the fish.
Tourist travel has already set in to Lake
Tahoe, and some fine catches of trout
have been made by trolling in the vicin
ity of Tahoe City and Tallac.
W. S. Tevis and wife have already gone
to the lake, having opened their beautiful
cottage on the lake shore near Tallac for
the season.
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler and family
left on Thursday night for the McCloud
River. Their new country house, pro
nounced the finest of its kind in the State,
is ready for occupancy.
The officers of the Chicago Fly-casting
Club have accepted the trophy offered by
the San Francisco Fly-casting Club for
competition at their championship tour
nament to be "held in August. The Chi
cago Club officials Ftill desire the donors
to name the conditions. As they do not
desire to do so it will probably be offered
the man making the highest general aver
age in all the events at the tournament.
These include distance, accuracy and deli
cacy with the fly and distance and accu
racy with the lure. The diffidence on the
part of the local club members In naming
conditions is due to the fact that they wilt
be. represented by W. D. Mansfield and A.
E. Lovett in the tournament, and they do
not wish 'to win their own medal.
.As Secretary Horace Smyth will not re
turn from his European trip until late In
tha present month the complimentary din
ner at which he was to have been enter
tained by the fly-casting club members
has been postponed until July.
Colonel C. G. Young will leave early in
July for the south fork of the American
River, where he win remain some time
enjoying the excellent fishing which the
place offers.
George Walker sent two dozen trout
from Sims on Wednesday. The largest
measured fourteen Inches.
F. A. Foote caught fifteen salmon at
Santa Cruz some days since. The largest
weighed thirty pounds.
AT the .next mooting -of the Inter
stale Coursing Club steps will be
taken to so increase the value of
the John Grace cahaJlenge cup
MaJce as to make it second in im
portance to the classic Eng!5sh Waterloo.
If the plan as mitLJiacd is easTLed into ef
iect the date of iMs fixture in the leash
man'Â« calendar will be changed from Feb
" ruary. when hares are not ax their best,
to September or October. It will thus be
coursw^d for for the second time this year,
Alfred Curtis' Luxor having w-on it last
February- All the conditions will be
changed to be in accord with those gov
erning the "Waterloo. The stake will be
limited to sixty-four dogs, each member
of thÂ« club being allowed but one nomina
tion. There are 120 members in the club,
but it is taken for granted that many of
these will not have a. dog <*f sufficient
"class" to be sent to the slips. The entry
' fee will be $50 for each do& making * a
total of $3200. It is expected that the di
rectors of Urfon Coursins Park, where
the stake will be decided. wDl add a like
emoum. making a total rrSse of $6100.
This would I** dividedâ $1WW to the win
ner, $TV) to the runners xxp, third and
fourth ?400 each nsid others in proportion.
There would also be special prizes for the
dogs btaten by Oie ultimate winner and
the runner up in the first round. Under
this proposed arranpemeni only sixteen
c.f the original sixty-four entries would
' pet no money.
The prizes an the largest ever offered
liere. The stake was worth 5750 to the
winner In February last. The largest
ji'jrse ever won in California was $?00, by
JamfF Dean's Mialmo, at Merced. To se
cure this big first prize the remainder had
to be cut down until they were insignifi

Ftake if the proposed change go into ef

In compiling the greyhound studbook
for the year the officials in charge find
many errors to be corrected. These were
all made gome years ago. ' when dogs
would run without registration, as little
attention was paid to that point. The
keeper of the studbook lived in Denver,
where all American greyhounds were reg
istered. Owners neglected their obliga
tions in this respect, with the result that
there are several dogs bearing the same
name. T. J. Cronin's Wild Xralee and
Rose of Tralee have their namesakes In
the East. The latter are registered, while
the Cronin dogs have never been properly
recorded. Sir Hugo, Miller's Rab, Ba
bazin and Tullamnre do not appear In
the stud books, although they were noted
dogs in their day. All these delinquencies
will be corrected in the forthcoming vol
ume.
Fred Price has assumed the manage
ment of the greyhounds in training be
longing to R. E. de B. Lopez & Son.
These include Whitrhead, Pepita, Carmen
cita* Crawford" Priory, Crawford Rex and
other flyers.
Tommy Murnane. one. of the 'cleverest
of the youthful handlers of dogs, has en
tered the employ of Eugene Geary.
Pasha kennels have some promising
youngsters by For Freedom. They are
ten months old and are out of Beauty
Spot and Miller's Rabbie. There is also
an eleven months old sapling by I Firm
Friend-Bona. which is expected to show,
well. He weighs seventy-two pounds and
will be allowed to mature before he is
coursed.
\V. C Olaspon has lost through pneu

They were fourteen months old and were
by ilnghie. out of Joy Bells.

LUCKY ZICK ABRAHAM
CASHES BOTH WAYS
YOUNG PETER JACKSON.
DENVER, June 8.â At the Colorado
Athletic Association to-night Young
Peter Jackson of San Francisco was
given a well-earned decision over Kid
Parker of Denver at the end of a ten
round-go at 140 pounds. Jackson was full
weight while the Kid tipped the beam at
137 pounds. The fighting was the fastest
and the battle the best ever witnessed in
this city. Science was thrown to the
winds and both men Indulged in their fa
vorite form of fighting, that of mixing
things. ,
Parker began with a rush and continued
to close in on Jackson for several rounds.
His stiff punches and uppercuts and Jabs
did not seem to affect Peter much, who
would frequently counter hard. Peter
started in to hold the Kid. and for two
rounds hung on to him, with the result
that Parker's wind was seriously weak
ened. For this offense Referee Billy
Woods cautioned Jackson repeatedly,
and had other matters been equal Par
ker would have earned the decision
through Peter's breach of the rules. At
different periods in the battle both men
were worn and tired and either might
have gone out v.Ith but little etort on the
part of the other. But in the last minute
of the tenth round and during a mix when
both were hammering each other with ut
ter disregard for accurate aim Peter halt
ed, brought his right over to the Kid's
jaw and jabbed a stiff left into his right
eye, flooring him. where he remained
nearly the limit. He was groggy when he
arose and managed to keep away from
Jackson, who seemed to lack the energy
to go after him until the gong sounded
for the close of the round.
The referee pointed to Jackson, who sat
silently in his corner while Biddy Bishop,
his manager, caressed him tenderly.
Parker was tho favorite in the betting at
"5 to 10, and much mency was lost by the
Parker followers.
The most Interesting preliminary was
between Fred Maynard, the Jockey, and
Dave Boyce, a local, who fought at 104
and 114 pounds respectively. Maynard got
the decision.
Â¦TFp FTER posing !n the ring at W'ood
,/ \\ wards Pavilion last night for the
jj â \ major portion of ten rounds Al
Â° Neill was suddenly and effectively
knocked out by Jark Moffatt. the Chi
rapoan, in the middle of the eleventh
round. / l."p to the very end the Califor
r.an fairly toyed with his opponent, the
attempts of the latter to liurt him being
bo farcical as to excite the ridicule of the
spectators.
In the sixth round the house vras in an
uproar. Neill stood in the middle of the
ring and let Moffatt lilt at him without
en attr-m.'it at hitting back. Aloffatt.
r '.. rw boxer as he is. seemed bewildered.
Â»ill stood with his hands at his side or
v.aved thtra about his head, leaving a big
t.irget at which Moffatt could shoot. The
latter triÂ«><3 all he knew to land on Neill,
but wherever he planted a glove there
NeiH ha<I his glove as a fender to ward
off damage. Moffatt was intensely in
earnest throughout the fight, trying every
art and artifice at his command to land
en effective blow. Ills very earnestness
iiimost set the spectators to Jeering, his
t fforts seemed so futile.
At t!mes during the fight he succeeded
in landing, but up to the end there seemed
r.o force behind his blows. That this was
deeepUve wes proved when the end came.
This was In the eleventh round, when
Nelll'B friends were becoming restive at
his apparent disinclination to go in and
win. as. from every outward appearance,
t-.e scorned capable of doing at any mo
ment he set himself going. Moffatt never
ceased trying, and in the eleventh he land-,
ed the blow for which he had been trying
throughout the fight.
He swung wildly with his right and
caught Neill on the point of the chin. It
was a palpable fluke, but it touched a
vulnerable point. Neill's knees bent un
der him and his oyes bulged out. The
spectators knew instantly and Instinctive
ly that Neil! had received his first knock
out and that the Idol of the followers of
boxing had bees shattered. Neill was
pame to the end, however, and tried to
stem the torrent of defeat.
His h^a-i did not clear quickly, but he
backed away from his merciless opponent,
knowing that in retreat lay his only hope
of saving himÂ«=elf. Moffatt in his f>ager
noss to win whs striking wildly at Neill's
head, missirg the majority of the blows
he aimpd at him. He finally backed him
up against the ropes and Neill went down
Â¦under a perfect whirlwind of rights and
lefts on the head.
He fell to the lower rop*Â», on which his
body balanced. He would have pitched
headlong to the floor of the building had
not willing hands boon raised to help him.
He was assisted to his feet, a defeated
man, when Moffatt, whom Referee
Welch had not noticed standing at his
side, sent his right to Neill's head. The
latter fell like a. log. this time being ren
dered entirely unconscious. He was car
ried to his corner, where he soon revived.
The Pavilion was in an uproar by this
time. The police drew their clubs and
cleared the rlns of the crowd which
surged Into It. Moffatrs ! seconds were
delirious at the unexpected turn affairs
had t3ken. They hugged their man and
kissed him.
Moffatt. as he passed Neilj^ reached over
arid kissed him, apparently not knowing
what be was doing. Neill recovercu
quickly and left the ring crying.
He was a 2 to 1 favorite in all the bet
ting. The mutuels at Harry Corbett's
paid $14 70 on each dollar invested.
Moffatt Takes Neill's Old Corner.
Ncill was the first to enter the ring.
He wore a sack coat, his only other cloth
ing being his boxing uunks. Moffatt fol
lowed him shortly afterward, clothed in
a long bathrobe, which gave him an unu
sually tall appearance. He went over and
*;hook hands with Neill and at the same
time the seconds were crossing to corners.
Neill had taken the southwest corner, the
one In which he generally fights, but Mof
fatt'B second won the toss and insisted
on his man having that corner. There ,
wis the " usual midring conference. In
which Referee Welch, the two principals
and their seconds ail took an animated
part. Neill illustrated several blows, ap
parently trying to demonstrate what it
meant to hit in the clinches.
When the bell finally sent the men to
gfther Moffatt started at once on the ag
gressive, backing Nelll into a corner,
where he landed right and left lightly on
the body. Neill then worked his way out
of the corner and stumbled, leaving an
opening for Moffatt. which the latter was
not quick to avail himself of. The style
of boring of the two nÂ»en proved similar
mid they seemed built en almost the same
lines. Neill assumed his crouching posi
tion frequently. Moffatt stood up straight.
He landed a left in the face and got one
in return. He came back again with an
other left In the face.
At this time Neill seemed suffering from
Etige fright, ard be did not recover from
it for a couple of rounds. As the men
came tocether In the second round Neill
I left a decided opening which Moffatt over
i looked. He, however, landed a light up
! percut en the face and then a hard right
on the body, having Xeill again In the
corner. The men had been fighting two
I minutes In this round when some one at
the rir.gside raised the cry that the elec
tric clock had stopped. There v.-jis mo
j mentary confusion, but the referee sent
the men together again. Moffatt was
again the aggressor at the outset of the
third round, out Neill came back at him
and lanO.fi some stiff body blows. Moffalt
was not to be denied, and lunded threo
j tin-.es on head and body, shaking Neill up
, considerably. lie landed two more on the
j body and kept at his work steadily. Xeill
; lav.ded a ri;;ht on the heart and followed
j with two light lefts on the face. Moffatt
j Staggered Neill with a It-ft and got three
j in quick succepplon on the head. At the
! bell NeiJl was doing the better work, and
j Moffatt pÂ»vmed slightly in. distress. Â¦ . I
Neili's Marvelous Shiftiness.
In the fourth round Neill puzzled Mof
. fatt With nis marvelous shiftiness on hia
i fet>t. They commerced to mix matters
! seriously for the linn time In this round,
i Neiil hammering- Moffatt all over the ring.
i Moffatt took ail his blows, which must
i have bec-n punishing ones, and came back
i lighting hart". He landed both right and
j left and then jabbed the local man twice
in the face with lefts. In a hot exchange
Neill landed right and left, but Molfatt
was trying all the time. The Chicagoan
drove Neill into the latter's corner Just
| before the bell and punished him severely
on the ropes.
The pace slowed down noticeably in the
fifth round, although Moffatt never ceased
trying. He opened proceedings by landing
left in stomach and Jabbed with his left
for the face. He caught Xeill off hla
guard a. moment later and landed again
on the body, but not doing any damage.
! Neill caught Moffatt coming toward him
j just before the end of the round with his
j right, but did no damage.
The spectators seemed to scent the end
j of the tisht when the sixth round opened,
j and many left their seats. They seemed
to think that Neill would commence to
do his fighting and once in action that
he would end the fight abruptly. Neill
I commenced hiÂ« posing at this point and
j made a monkev of Moffat. He first :
I jabbed him in the face and then stood in
t the middle of the ring and throughout
i the round l*t Moffat- hit at him at will.
It was a marvelous exhibition of blocking.
Neill's body seemed fairly upholstered
with boxing gloves. He would leave his
body unprotected apparently, but when
1 Moffat tried to plant his glove on any
I part of NeiH's anatomy the latter's glove
j was there to break the force of the blow.
The spectators cheered the showing, but
the undercurrent of conversation was to
the effect that Neill should attend more
closely to the business in hand and not
! show off. The seventh round was one of
j inaction, neither man doing much work.
Neill's best blow was a hard right on
' the hend. while Moffat landed one on the
I body and in doping in got a light right
! and left in return.
Neill was the aggressor throughout the
eighth round. He landed a left on the
j h^a'l after consuming a lot of time in
feinting. He tried a hard right swing
for the head, but was wide of his mark.
His efforts were all directed for a time
to landing this blow. Moffatt seemed all
at sea for a time and apparently did not
know? -what to do.
Neill was the aggressor in the ninth
round, missing a right swing and then
Jabbing Moffatt on the nose. Neill landed
a left on the face and a right on the
body, but Moffatt came back and stag
gered him with a right on the throat.
Nciil continued his Jabbing on the nose
and staggered Moffatt in a mix-up with
a right on the body. Just before the bell
Moffatt ?ent Neill's head back with a
straight right on the nose.
Neill bad all the better of the early part
of the tenth round. He landed a left
hook on the jaw and then ducked under a
lot of swings from Moffatt. He kept
cloÂ«e to Moffatt's guard and the latter
could do nothing. Moffatt suddenly came
back at Neill and landed several rights
and lefts which shook the latter up.
Moffatt's Wild and Fatal Swing.
At the beginning of the Eleventh round,
which proved so fatal to Neill, the Call
fornlan seomed as fresh as when he start
ed. The pace livened and Neill's friends
were confident that the end was in sight
and that their man would be an easy win
ner. Moffatt was the first to show, land
ing a left on the face, which caught Neill
going away and doing no damage. Neill
gave a hard right in return and then Mof
fatt swung wildly at him with his right.
The blow caught Neill on the vital- point
of the chin. His knees bent under him j
and his eyes seemed as though about to
pop out of his head. Moffatt wa^ quick
to see hi? advantage and landed several
rights and lctts on Neill's head. The lat
ter retreated, having recovered â¢ his senses
In a degree, but Moffatt followed him
around the ring. He was too excited to
land the finishing blow and missed a
number cf desperate swings at Neill's
head He finally backed Neill up aga'nst
the ropes en the northern end of the ring
nnd knocked him down until his body was !
Suspended on the lower rope. Neill was |
dazed and Referee Welch helped him to
Moffatt was standing to the left of [
Wolch and slightly behind him. As the ,
referee placed Neill on his feet Moffalt j
took deliberate aim at his chin and felled j
him with a blow which resounded through !
out the building and above the uproar
caused by the spectators. This Alme Neill
vras completely out. and Moffatt was de
clared the winner.
The proposed fifteen-round bout between
Willie Cole and Toby lrwin was stopped
I by Police Lieutenant Anderson In the
fourteenth round and was declared a draw*
by Referee Welch. The Interference of the
police seemed uncalled for, as neither man
had been hurt and there seemed no likeli
hood of either cf them being injured. Cole
was the apgressor in many of the rounds.
! He seemed to lami the most blows and
I had suffered but little punishment. He
seemed entitled to the decision by a small
margin, lrwin could not use his left with
, any dÂ«gree of accuracy. Cole blocking It
! every time it was launched.
â¢ u hen the bell sent the men together
for the first round Cole at once was on
; the aggressive and tried to corner lrwln.
but failed to do iw. lrwin landed his left
twice but without damage and got a stiff
i;ght in return. Cole hit while the men
were clinched and was warned bv the
referee. There was one spell of slugging
out of which the men came unscathed.
The rounu was a pretty exhibition of
boxing. <;
Cole opened proceedings in the second
round with a right which staggerer] lr
win lrwin came back with left twice on
the body Cole triod a left for the face
ar.d landed after which lrwin had the
V e Â£v H 1^- sharp mlx Â»P- lrwin again
Jabbed him in the face. Cole showing
some signs of distress from his exertions
and from some body blows. lrwin land
ed a left in the face at the end of the
round which sent Cole's head back with
a snap The round ended with more slug
ging the boxers standing up, giving blow
tor blow without regard to their defence.
Cole sailed in again in the fourth round
lrwin depending on jabbing to keep him
away Cole backed him into a corner and
landed a stinging blow flush on thÂ«
mouth. lrwin kept trying with his left
for the body but Cole caught him with
a right each time.
Cole landed left on the mouth at the
opening of the fifth round and had lrwin
hacking away. In a clinch Cole played
a tattoo on Irwin's body about the kid
neys. Cole went down near the end of
if . ro ' lnd , f , ron ? a rignt on tn e mouth
which drew blood. He stayed down nine
seconds In the sixth round Cole landed
both right and left on the body, and in
a clinch turned toward the referee and
lrwin nearly caught him napping. Ho
landed, but his aim was not good and thi>
blow did not prove effective. Cole ducked
a heavy left and just at the bell landed
a left on tho face. The seventh round
in its early stage was all Irwin's. He
landed a lrft swing hard in the face
nearly knocking Cole through the ropes
This only stirred up the latter and he '
came back lighting fast. The crowd
hissed Irwin for striking at Cole when
the latter was recovering from a stumble ;
caused by a wet spot in the ring near his !
corner. The pace slowyd down In the
f'jg'Jtn round, neither man doing much
effective work and devoting most of their
time to feinting. The ninth whs livened
up p. bit and In this Irwin's left eye was |
opened and bled rather freely. I
The tenth round was Blow, being chiefly
notable from the viciousness displayed bv
Cole. The eleventh round was all Cole's
He opened ud Irwin's wounded eye and
toward the end of the round landed right
and left several times on the face. In I
the twelfth Cole again onened proceedings !
and was hissed for using his elbow Im
mediately lifter he was applauded for
EÂ«&e clover work in Irwin's corner The
thirteenth was Irwin's round. Cole slow
ing down considerably. In the fourteenth
and last round Cole left his corner fai-ly
on the run for lrwin. He landed two lefts
in the face without serious damage when
the police stopped proceedings.
The first preliminary was between
George Curran and Kid Finnerty and was
won by the former in the seventh round
George Green, Finnerty's second threw
up the sponge to save his man from in
evitable defeat. In tho early rounds of
the fight Finnerty had a lead, but try as
he would he could not stop Curran. . The
latter stood a lot of punishment and then
came back at Finnerty, beating him to a
standstill. Finnerty then went down re
peatedly to avoid punishment. He bled
profusely from a bad cut over the right
eye from an injury he received in â¢ the
third round. The fighting throughout was
of the hurricane order, the amount of
punishment the youngsters stood and the
pace at which they fought being a mat
ter of surprise to the spectators. J. A
McGinley acted as referee.
Â«
Policing the Fight.
While the public school building on Tel
egraph Hill was on fire on Wednesday and
the lives of 500 children were endangered
the Police Department could spare but
one patrolman and a sergeant to handle
the crowd and assist In saving the chil
dren. Last night at the prizefight there
was a squad of twelve men in charge of a
lieutenant of police and a sergeant. They
hampered the people who had tickets of
admission, many not being able to'caln
admittance to the building. fe

* ftTHE NINE-LIVED EVIL.
The Board of Supervisors is confident that it will
need r.o more money for the next fiscal year # than for
the present to provide for the maintenance of prison
ers in the county jails. It is quite possible that the
closing of Ingleside has given the City Fathers con
fidence in the hope th3t the number of local criminals
will decrease.
The City Attorney has been asked to shed the light
of his legal learning upon the Board of Supervisors
and tell that worthy body whether or not it is legal
to close th<? cemeteries within the city limits. Some
body in authority ought to ask the' City Attorney if
he has any power to keep open public streets â Sulli
van alley, for example.
No Fear of the Plague.
Philadelphia Inquirer.
It may be that the bubonic plague has
reached San Francisco. Dr. Shrady. the
well known New York physician, seems
to think that It has, and yet it is very
strange that no one has yet been ablo
to find any one suffering with the disease.
There have been several suspicious deaths
and the doctors base their opinion en
tirely upon the results of autopsies. â¢ â¢
Either San Francisco has never had the
plague or else it has nothing to fear even
with it present. No white person has died
with anything that looks like it. and it
has been confined wholly within the limits
of Chinatown. Asiatics are peculiarly
plague victims, and yet in the midst of
these 20.000 or 20.000 Chinamen, where It
would seem to have every opportunity for
spreading. It Is practically harmless.
One thing Is certain; it is very foolish
for any one to get excited over the situ
ation in San Francisco. In a panic, the
health officials of the State of Texas have
quarantined against the city. That is
absurd. This country Is not a good field
for the plague, and if it really has ap
peared among the Chinamen of San Fran
cisco and has been controlled so easily
no one need worry over its spread east
ward.
OUR CONSULAR "SYSTEM."
AR. BAYARD TAYLOR was once a candidate
for the position of Consul General at Berlin.
Some one else received the appointment.
When asked how he accounted for his defeat Mr.
Taylor replied: "There were three things against
me â First, I speak German; second, I know the Ger
man people; third. I* am a gentleman." .
This arraignment of our so-called consular "sys
tem" is hardly too severe. It is, unfortunately, even
truer to-day perhaps than when Mr. Taylor uttered
his memorable epigram. Those who doubt this.as
sertion should consult an article by Mr. Harry Gar
field in the June Century, entitled "Our Consular
Service." From this it appears that one of the un
foreseen results of the civil service law has been the
dumping into the open lot of our unfortunate consular
"service" of a load of political heelers who could not
be shot over the high fence of that law into the pre
! serves of the other governmental departments. The
personnel of the "service" instead of improving has
been, according to Mr. Garfield. steadily deteriorating.
To those familiar with the methods of appointing
Consuls there is nothing new or startling in
Mr. Garficld's exposure of the arrogance, ig
j norance and imbecility which he found per
vading an important consulate of the United
j States. This imbecility, ignorance and arro
i gance will Ve the rule. Competency, knowledge and
courtesy will be. as now, the exception so long as
our exporters are content to 'allow places in the con
sular "service" to be scrambled for by unscrupulous
politicians and their Congressional backers. It is
very certain that Congress will never reform the "sys
tem" of its own accord, for we live in an age of pru
dence, as Disraeli said, and the leaders follow the
people. "The people" here concerned are. as inti
mated above, the merchants whose interests lie in for
eign trade: from them must come the pressure that
J shall make our consular service a profession worthy
I the consideration of men of first-rate ability. As â¢-*
rule such men will not expatriate themselves for three
or four years with the certainty of being turned out
at the end of that time and of being obliged to begin
their lifcwork all over again. Only a third-rate man
I will do that, and solong as we put up with third-
I rate men we must compete for the world's trade at a
disadvantage with nations like Germany and England,
which have well organized and efficiently administered
consular systems.
. A Consul to-day is largely a commercial and very
little a political officer. Take the consular service out
of politics and put it where it belongsâ on a business
basis. ,
WHEN the first reports of the insurrection in
China were received in this country Wu Ting
fang, the Chinese Minister at Washington, is
Â¦ reported to have made himself merry over them and
to have ridiculed the idea that the insurgents could
I seriously menace the peace of the empire or the lives
I cf foreigners residing there. He is quoted as saying
I the Chinese name of the so-called Boxers is "Ye Ho
Chuan," and means "righteousness," "harmony" and
"fists." and in a jesting way he added it is probably
the intention of the society to cultivate muscle for
the promotion of virtue and to teach harmony by fis
ticuffs.
I^ater reports show that the clever Minister was
I either ignorant of the conditions of his own country
or was talking ns a diplomatist when he made such
sport of the insurgent society. The Boxers have
caused a disturbance so serious that various powers,
including the United States, have found it necessary
to send warships to the danger points and land ma
rines and bluejackets for the protection of their citi
zens. It is even said Russia is massing an army for
the invasion of China and that Japan is preparing
to assert her claims to Korea by force of arms should
the Russian advance be made.
The feature of the situation most interesting to us
is the evident desire on the part of the Chinese and
the British to induce the United States to interfere
and prevent any partition of the empire in case war
breaks out. The British are not in a position just
now to act with any effectiveness against Russian ag
gression unless they should have strong allies, and
I they cannot hope to find them anywhere in Europe.
Therefore they turn to us with expectation and pos
sibly with hope. The Chinese, on the other hand,
have no desire to see an alliance of the United States
with Great Britain, but wish our Government to main
tain the empire as it is in defense of American trade.
The British press in discussing the crisis has
strongly urged American intervention. The argu
ment put forth in London is that should Great Brit
ain and Russia interfere to suppress the insurrection
they would almost certainly come into conflict and
thus "Tiring about a war more dangerous than the in
surrection itself, while, on the other hand, the United
States could act with the consent of all. The Daily
Mail goes so far as to refer to the situation as "Mc-
Kinley's opportunity." and says: "The opportunity
for America has come. Will she let it slip from her
hands and lose her vest potentialities of/ trade in
Northern China?"
A similar view of the case is presented in. an article
in the current number of the Forum by Ho Yow.
Chinese Consul 'General to this country. Discussing
the efforts of various European powers to dismember
China in order to obtain exclusive trade privileges
over certain provinces, he says: "No unusual per
ceptive powers arc required to see that if the United

ALL READY FOR BUNKER
HILL DAY CELEBRATION
THE DAY WE CELEBRATE
THERE was some doubt abroad in the land
about celebrating July 4, 1000. The dealers
in fire vorks were thinking of compound
ing with their creditors, and the welkin seeme \
safe from being ?piit by the combination of noises
provided for in the speech which Webster put into
the mouth of John Adams in relation to the proper,
abandoned and noisy way in which the day should be
observed.
A sordid and sodden generation was about to skip
a holiday and go on laying up riches where moth
and ru*t doth corrupt and thieves break through
and steal. 1 he hilarious firecracker was in despair.
Vesuvius seemed about to die out with all its noise
and swell in its belly. Bombs, whims, pin-.vheels and
rockets. Roman candles, fountains and all the mem
ber:- of the illuminated picrate and nitrate family were
feeling the clammy touch of indifference and neglect.
The orators expectant Acre languishing unin%ited to
turn the tap of eloquence and let it flow. The young
lady who sings "America" and the principal of the
bchool who reads the Declaration, in every neighbor
hood, were falling out of practice. The processional
talent of each town, from that which arranges in line
the industrial floats, t'ne Goddess of Liberty and the
horrible*, to the committee on placehoics which >e
lects "the leading citizens in carriages," without of
fense to those who arc not chosen, was out of com
mission, and it looked as though this country had
celebrated its las* Independence day.
But upon the chaos and black night of indifference
all at one! there flashed Billy Hearst's order to
the American prnplc to celebrate the Fourth of July.
William ha? been having the subject read up to him
and decided that there must be a celebration. In <~tr.
der to have it go off dl right he orders the people to
do their celebrating under the auspices of the Bryan
eJubs. He believes these clubs to be the present cus
todians of the day celebrate and to possess the
fimon pure recipe for doing it honor. Of course in
thos,e benighted regions where there are no Bryan
club- there enn be no regularly authorized and prop
erly certificated celebration at all. In those plax'cs it
will be default day. But elsewhere silly-BilJy com
mands and ordains a racket, with the same pomposity
that Emperor Norton used in ordering a billion dollar
issue of his bonds. All the fireworks are ordered to
work, from the Mongoloid cracker to the largest ser
pent. Powder, smoky and smokelrs% giant and
dwarf, if to btirn. Ir.'.rst and detonate, according to
Jitt'e-IiiHic's order.
He has just been elected president of the national
organ izst ion of Bryan clubs, and has taken charge of
the Fourth of July, officially; to save it from falling
into desuetude, more or less innocuous. We are sur
prised that he did not order his celebrated "nail the
flag to the Philippines and gox'ern them outside the
constitution" editorial read as a dessert after the solid
meat of the Declaration.
It is rumored thai this petite person will soon is
sue a proclamation separating day from night, telling
why a doj^s nose is cold, revealing the right sign of
the zodiac in which to plant beans, and why meat
chrinks in cooking if it is slaughtered in the old of

of Miss Church is on exhibition in town.
Though not comparable in technique. In

0 NEW BROOM flT WORK-
IIZJOLLOWING the exposure made by The Call
of the inefficient manner in which the Chinese
exclusion act has been enforced at this port by
the customs officials comes the action of the Govern
ment transferring the duty of examining Chinese and
passing upon their right to admission to the country
from the Collectors of Customs to the officers of the
Bureau of Immigration. Under the new rule the en
forcement of the restriction act in San Francisco will
be in the hands not of Collector Jackson, as here
tofore, but of Hart H. North, local Immigration
Commissioner.
A familiar proverb declares: "A new broom sweeps
clean." We have therefore good reason for expecting
most if not all of the interferences with the enforce
ment of the law which were so conspicuous in the
Customs office will be swept away under the new man
agement. The work has been transferred to the
Bureau of Immigration avowedly in the interests of
reform. The manner in which the restriction act was
enforced, or not enforced, by Collectors of Customs
waj not satisfactory to any part of the country, and
the dissatisfaction was fully justified by the facts. It
is now to be seen how far the Immigration Commis
sioners will improve upon the work of their prede
cessors in authority, how far they will be able to
eradicate the old abuses of the act and enforce it with
firmness and impartiality.
The fight which The Call made for a stricter ex
clusion of Chinese immigration has thus borne good
fruit. Congress has taken steps to remedy the evils
which The Call pointed out. From the Commis
sioner of Immigration we look for such an enforce
ment of the exclusion law as will prevent that whole
sale admission of Chinese under the pretense of being
"native sons," which has been exposed by the inves
tigations made by The Call. In that expectation the
public will share, and there will be a widespread ap
proval of the action taken by Congress in making the
transfer of authority.
It must not be supposed, however, that all danger
will be overcome by the act of vesting the enforce
ment of the exclusion law in the hands of a new set
of officials. The temptations to corruption and to
neglect of duty remain as great and as potent as ever.
There is a large profit to be obtained by bringing
Chinese into the country, and the men who have en
joyed that profit in the past will not willingly sur
render it. It is a foregone conclusion that they will
at once set about devising some scheme for evading
the law under the new control as under the old. For
that reason the public vigilance must not be relaxed.
The people must be on guard as heretofore. The Call
will do its share in the future as in the past, and will
be prompt to expose any failure on the part of the
new authorities to maintain the law unimpaired in
all its force and scope. The -menace of Chinese in>
migration will never pass away so long as wages are
high an/1 prosperity prevails in the United States, and
here atW Golden Gate the watch must be kept with
unrelaxing vigilance and fidelity.
Perhaps if some of our local teachers who are
"spieling" for students for their schools were to try
to learn the political combination of the School Board
they might meet with better success in their efforts
to prevent decapitation.

EDITOR The Call: Are there 53.35S
neglected children in California?
It certainly Is not Indifference of
parents that excludes from the San

5000 between the ages of five and six,
vastly more than one-twelfth of all be

would if willing parents were consulted.
The avaricious parent is the exception.
The poor feel that an education is all they
can give their children, and deny them
selves to the point of pity to bestow on
the little ones what they themselves sadly
lack. The mother will rise before day
break to wash her little girl's only white
apron and dry It in the ironing to make
her child presentable at school. The con
trast in dress between that of toiling pa
rents and their children is at times pa

teacher going out In helpless sympathy

gives up dosing the unwilling youth of la

should, but who thereby adds to the so
called 53.35S street arabs.
Our course of study and its misinterpre

this. The average parent thinks nine

San Francisco, June 7, 1M0.
COLOXEL BRYAN'S reliance for a nomination
is upon the solid South. His only hope of an
election is in the certainty of the Southern
electoral vote and the expectation to join New York
thereto, by the help of Tammany.
Now the remarkable feature in this, situation is that
neither Tammany nor the South believes in anything
that Colonel Bryan advocates. Those who have in
vestigated the subject in the last three months have
been startled by the discovery that the South is nearly
unanimous for expansion. 'for holding the Philippines
and hunting around for more to hold in that neigh
borhood, if we can n"r.d it.
A prominent supporter of Bryan, from the South,
recently declared in New York that if Bryan were
elected the Philippines would not be alienated. He
Said we would hold them and get all we could out of
them, to do so being essential to the prosperity of
the South, and as for the Filipinos they had "'no rights
that we are bound to respect." A careful inquiry,
from North Carolina to the Gulf, discloses the aston
ishing fact that 75 per cent of the men in the South
m!io arc under forty years of age favor holding the
Philippines. Another astounding disclosure from the
South is that the people have quit on free silver.
Their industries are in fuH blast, money is plentiful and
can be borrowed at a lower interest than at any time
since the war. They do not feel that any free silver
experiment is necessary to inflate the currency, for
it is already plentiful and its use is cheap. This leaves
only the trust issue unbroken in the campaign quiver
of arrows carried by Colonel Bryan, and that is far
less talked about in 'he South than in the North. It
is in third place, anyway, among Colonel Bryan's
campaign material, silver and expansion ranking it.
Here, then, we have the singular spectacle of the
South solidly combined to nominate for the Presi
dency a man whose principles they reject and repu
diate." They do not scruple to say that if Colonel
Bryan is elected the strength of the Democratic party
in Congress, will come from the South, and they do
not propose to drop a profitable cotton market as the
Philippines promise to be, nor do they propose any
ft olish experiment in finance to disturb â and perhaps
destroy â conditions under which the South is pros
perous
An election of Colonel Bryan under these circum
stances will not mean anything. It will settle nothing.
It will leave the financial question where it is, in such
advance toward adjustment as it has made by the
legislation of this year. It will not mean any change
in the Philippine situition. In fine, it will not mean :i
tiling which the promoters of Colonel Bryan now pre
tend it will mean.
Feeling as it docs, the South should vote for Mc-
Kinlcy. but it will not. That section is quite willing
that the Republican party shall pull its chestnuts out
of the fire, shall open a market to i f<; cotton, protect
its sugar, rice and tobacco, but it is not willing to
reciprocate. The Southern Democracy is simply
anxious to add to the profits of trade due to Repub
lican policy the profits of power by putting the Re
publican party in a minority. When Morgan of Ala
bama found his seat in the Senate in peril in the whirl
wind campaign that Governor Johnson was making
against him he simply declared himself an expan
sionist and not in favor of free silver, and in the pri
maries beat Johnson two to one. As it is in Ala-
Lama, so it i> throughout the South, and yet Colonel
Bryan has galled his mouth denouncing the expansion
wickedness of Republicans!
In Tennessee the most popular Democratic candi
date for Senator h making his stump campaign for
holding the Philippines, and defies any one to show
how they can be constitutionally dropped. He says
to let them po will require an amendment to the con
stitution. He does not seem to have reflected that
that will mean a constitutional amendment to author
ize the dissolution of the Union.
ABNO^MfJL POLITICS.
States secures equal trading rights in all spheres of
influence an end will be put to that particular line of
European policy in the Far East. That is exactly the
object for which all intelligent and patriotic Chinese
have striven, but the end has arrived before it was ex
pected." ' : / ,
It is thus evident that a great strain will be put upon
the State Department by the present crisis. Should
the antagonism now burning so fiercely between the
Japanese and the Russians find vent in war over any
of the issues the Boxer insurrection is likely to give
rise to, the task of guarding our interests in China
without taking part in the war will require the high
est statesmanship. It i?. therefore fortunate that at
this time we have an administration in whom the peo
ple can safely trust. We will protect our own trade,
but we will not pull chestnuts out of the fire for
either Great Britain or Japan.

The School Journal.
Can It be true that there are still some
people in positions of authority in matters
concerning the schools who have the cour
age to hold on to the antediluvian exam
inations as a test of promotion? What
would be thought of a prosecuting attor
ney who should ask In sober earnest, "Is
it your Honor's pleasure that we place the
witness on the rack, or shall we begin
with the thumbscrews?" And yet in the
educational field no one seems surprised
at running up against a person wearing
the same queued w jg that his prototype
of 290 years ago used to be proud of being
asked by a self-contented relic of this
kind" whether there really, are . teachers
who get along 'without either rawhide or
ferrule. Nothing short of legal measures
will ever make these people see that the
purpose of the school is other than to
coach pupils to pass examinations. Let

LONDON, June S. â A special from Cairo

good authority that the immediate addi
tion of 7000 troops to the British forces in
Egypt has been demanded. A representa

War Office that there is not the slightest
foundation for this report.
Agricultural Park Sold.
SAX JOSK, June 8.â To-day the Santa
Clara Valley Agricultural Society went
out of existence by selling its interest in
the fair grounds, comprising 7C.T5 acres of
valuable land, to the San Jose Land and
Improvement Company for $20,000, with a
covenant that each life member of the
old society is to receive one share of the
capital stock of the new company and
that the -shareholders, numbering about
180 shall constitute the new company. The
sale was made in order that the debts
of the old company might be paid, the
$20,000 being borrowed from A. L. McKen
dry, who was secured by mortgage on the
property.
JOURNALIST AND
ARCHITECT MAY FIGHT
CHICAGO. June 8.â Major General E. S.
Otis arrived at 7:20 this morning from
San Francisco and left at 10:30 for Wash
ington. Mrs. Otis and daughter arrived
In Chicago last night from New York and
the general and his wife and daughter
spent the hours between trains together
âthe ending of a separation of two years.
General Otis declined to enter into a
detailed Interview, but he was perfectly
willing to talk in a general way. He Bald
he had not been 111 a day since he left
for the Philippines and at present was
enjoying the best of health. ,
"1 left the Philippine situation in the
best of hands," he said. "The officers are
all able men and well qualified to cope
with the different questions and situations
that may arise. The war Is over. This
guerrilla warfare can't last long. To be
sure, we will have to repress those people
for a number of years, but there is no
organized force of Filipinos. The depre
dations that are now going on are con
ducted tiy robbers and 'ladrones. The
United States troops are now engaged in
defending the inhabitants of the Philip
pines against the robbery and murder
committed by their 1 own people. But the
conditions are generally improving and In
some parts are better than they have ever
been.
"We have 55,000 effective troops under
arms in the Philippines. Kstimates re
garding the number of inhabitants in the
islands are all wild, but the number is
considered to be between 6,00U,tWQ and
7,000,000. The great majority of the people
desire peace and wish to again take up
their business pursuits. Business in Ma
nila has again resumed activity and the
inhabitants are peacefully pursuing their
vocations.
"I do not know where Agulnaldo Is. I
never saw him personally. It Is possible,
but not probable, that Aguinaldo is In the
Cayagayan section of Northern Luzon. It
is a rough, mountainous country, and
very sparsely settled. At first he was re
garded by his people as a leader, but of
late he is losing prestige and is not held
In such high regard.
"Funston 19 now in the Bulacan section.
I will say I am not going Into any per
sonalities whatever. The officers In charge
are all capable men.
"Stories have been circulated about dep
redations committed, by men of our army,
but they have been false. Our men have
been held under close restraint and have
conducted themselves like soldiers.
"I can't see that the administration of
our distinguished Secretary of War has
made any mistakes in this campaign. We
may have made mistakes over there, but
If so they have been the result of human
liability to commit error.
"Official reports of the warfare have
not been exaggerated, especially of late.
1 am, not Conversant with the newspaper
reports. Although I received American
newspapers I had not the time to peruse
them. The censorship has not been rigid,
and we assisted the newspaper corre
spondents all we could. Of course, some
sensational telegrams were sent, but it
was very difficult for newspaper men to
secure correct versions regarding our op
erations, as they wert so extended, but
we helped them wherever we could.
','1 have no Idea as to my course after
I reach Washington. I have received no
orders, and I simply await the commands
of my superiors.
"My wife and daughter will not ac
company me to Washington. They will
return to New York to-day and I wilt
Join them later. I was certainly over
joyed to see them, as this Is the first time
I have seen them In two years."
Regarding the situation in China Gen
eral Otis said: â¢;â¢
"I know very little. about the Chinese
question. I left Manila early in May, be
fore the recent complications in that coun
try had reached the present critical state
and I know very little about tt. The sit
uation seems to be developing very gen
erally and all European nations are in
terested in It."
WASHINGTON. June 8.â Major General
Otis will arrive here to-morrow. Ho will
remain In Washington for a few days
only and will go to hi-thome^t Rochester,
N. Y.. in time to attend the public recep.
tlon to be. given by the citizens of that
place In his honor on the 15th Inst. It is
expected that he will make a verbal re
port to the President of the conditions In
the Philippines during hla brief visit here
and that he will return here Inter In the
summer .for* a more comprehensive dis
cussion of the situation In the Far East.

OTIS SAYS THE
WAR IS OVER IN
PHILIPPINES
Corporal Carson, Who Was in Com
mand, and Every Man Com
mended for Gallantry
and Endurance.
WASHINGTON, June 8.â Perhaps the
most thrilling and picturesque incident of
the entire Philippine war occurred at
Catubig. on the island of i-amar, where
on April lil last a party of thirty-one en-
listed men of Company K, Forty-third In
fantry Volunteers, held at bay a force of
some six hundred Insurgents during four
days of tierce lighting, reinforcements ar
riving just in the nick of time.
The War Department has received re
ports from Captain H. M. Day of the
l'orty-third Voiunteer Infantry and First
Lieutenant J. T. Sweeney ot that regi
ment, wno commanued the rescue party,
giving all the aetaiis of the attacus at
me siege and. the relief.
According to the reports the attack on
the garrison at Catuoig began without
wannng on Sunday morning, April 15.
fc'rom the hills on all sides, from every
point of vantage in the town, and from a
aeserted cnurcn directly adjoining came
a ntle and cannon fire ot terrible Intensity.
On Tuesday morning handfuls of burning
hemp were thrown into the barracks by
the insurgents and soon the soldiers'
reluge was on fire. All efforts to subdue
the nre failed and finally the little band
made a rush for the river bank. Some
were killed before the bank was reached,
others fell dead in a boat in which it was
intended to make the opposite shore, and
when a trench was finally dug with
bayonets there were only sixteen of the
thirty-one left. Here for two more days
Corporal Carson, handling his men with
the judgment of a veteran, held out. under
a terrible fire until the arrival of Lieuten
ant Sweeney's command, which had been
ordered to supplement the garrison at
Catubig and which was on its way up the
river on the steamer Lao Aug. Not until
within a quarter of a mile of Catubig,
says Lieutenant Sweeney in his report,
did they hear the noise of the engagement.
Then he realized that he and his men
were sorely needed, and he ordered the
captain of the steamer to run his boat at
top speed. The Lao Aug steamed up to
Catubig River under a rain of Mauser
bullets from both shores. The small boats
were lowered, a landing effected and the
rescuers fought their way through the
open to their besieged comrades in the
trenches, burled the dead within reach,
brought back to the boat the besieged
party, numbering now only thirteen, and
then steamed down the river.
Captain Day bestows the highest com
mendation upon Corporal Carson as "dis
playing extraordinary Judgment In the
handling of his men, thereby saving the
lives of the survivors, and protecting the
wounded until relief came."
To each of the little command and their
rescuers he gives the highest praise.
"Their zeal and ability." he says, "were
a fitting example of the worth and cour
age of the American soldier."

PLACERVILLB, June 8.â The horror of
last night's tragedy at the home of George
Zumwalt, three miles from this city, still
fills the minds of every resident of this
little city. â¢ ;;ii z
Isaiah Zumwalt, aged 64, and his wife
Julia, aged 60, were pioneer residents of
the county. They lived in the suburbs of
this city In a lovely home and reared' a
large family. About four years ago the
couple separated, and four weeks ago the
wife obtained a divorce in the Superior
Court of this county, alleging failure to
provide as the cause for divorce.
Zumwalt is locked up In one of the steel
cages in the County Jail. It is said by
the ja^l othcials that after being locked
up last night he titpt soundly until this
morning.
To a friend who called upon him this
morning iw expressed sorrow for the :rcur
der of his wifV and son, but said that >>id
lie known that he had failed In his at
tempt to kill his daughter-in-law Kose.
the wife of George Zumwalt, he would
have followed her to the neighoor's house,
whore she ran for protection, and finished
her. v â¢
The facts in regard to the cause of the
shooting as far as can be learned indicate
that trouble has been brewing f^r some
time. Parties in their neighborhood
claim that it was caused by jealousy on
the part <jf the old man of his son's wife,
while he claims that thÂ« y were about to
turn him from his home after having
gained {wspession of his property.
The old man made a statement to the
eflect that he had deeded tne property
upon which Gtorge was living to him, bui
had retained the deed pending a settle
ment of certain money matters, and had
been living with George on the place. Not
being satisfied with their treatment of
him he made complaint and was ordered
off the premises by George"* wife. When
he appealed to George he was informed
that if she said he must go, that set
tled it.
An inquest was hold at Diamond Sprinps
at 10 o'clock this morning. The jury re
turned verdicts to Coroner Wlnehel charg
ing Zumwalt with willful murder in three
ca?esÂ« and assault to commit murder in
one case. Dr. K. W. Mountain of this city,
who Js attending Mrs. Rose Zumwalt, be
lieves that phe will recover. Everything
is quiet In this city. While there is 'ntense
feeling- against Zumwalt. the disposition
of a-11 is to let the law take its course.

Mr. Behr adopted the mono-rail system that has been used
v.-ith such success for steam-driven trains. The weight of the
train is borne on a single rail supported on trestles, with :iide
rails to act as guides and prevent rocking. The system was
tried experimentally at Brussels and gave very satisfactory
results.
Though a committee of the House of Commons has reported
adversely to the scheme on the ground that the new line would
diive the old lines out of business, Mr. Behr, and his friends
have good reason to hope for favorable action on another
hearing.
THE latent novelty in the way of transportation is a single
rail line between Manchester and Liverpool projected by
Mr. Behr.
The two cities named are already connected by three lines
of railroad, giving quick service at frequent intervals, but Mr.
Urhr's plan Is different from any of them. It is to follow an
approximately straight line between the two cities without any
intermediate stations. Trains are to run every ten minutes
nnd make the distance, twenty-seven miles, in twenty minutes.
The train consists of two carriages, each provided with Its
own motors. In order to secure safety at this enormous speed

WASHUCGTOSTJ June S.â President llc-
KinJey and Senator Mason have shaken
hands and the breach which has existed
between them for the past year has been
healed. Whi'.e the President was at the
Capitol yesterday signing the last laws
parsed by Congress Senator Mason hap
pened to etop directly in front of the
open door of the President's room to
epeak to his sister, who was passing
through the corridor. President MoKln
ley raised his eyes and they met those or
the Senator. The President at once ad
rasced to the door and the Senator rn
tfrod the room, where the two men shook
hands and had a brief talk. The Presl
der.t asked Senator Mason how long he
would remain in Washington, and learn
ing that he would be here several days
alter the close of the hession invited him
to visit the White House. The Senator
will call on the President to-morrow and
the reconciliation will be complete 1 . As
a. result the Senator will cease his attacks
upon the administration and will be re
rtored to favor at the White House and
will take the stump for President McKin
ley during the campaign. As Senator Ma
son has considerable following in Illinois
his loyai support of the President and
thÂ« Republican ticket will add to the
strength of the party in that State.

PHOENIX, Ariz., June 8.â New River
Station, twenty miles west of Phoenix,
was the scene of one of the most atro
cious crimes in the history of Arizona
Thursday. Four Mexicans attacked An
ton Olson and John Stuart, proprietors of
the station store, caught them outside un
armed and shot both. Stuart fell at the
first shot. Olsen ran toward the store,
but the second shot stopped and finished
him. The murderers robbed the till and
carried away part of the stock.
This morning Deputy Sheriff Nelson of
Prescott. while following the trail of the
Fame party, who had held, up prospector
W. H. Rice, in Vavapai County, reliev
ing him of his poid dust, found the bodies.
He continued on the tnfcil to near Phoe
nix, where he was joined by Sheriff Mur
ray and deputies, A large force is in hot
pursuit. Another party has been formed
to go to the aid of the Sheriff.
The same party of Mexicans held up a
gambling- resort at Globe, relieving the
gamekeepers and players of a large
amount of cash. One week ago they
robbed two prospectors, James Allen and
Charles Krickson. near Jerome of $200 and
two horses, and stole four horses last
week from cattlemen south of Prescott.
A message to-night says the posse is
close upon the murderers. A hard battle
Is expected. A relief force will start from
here to aid the posse early to-morrow
morning. The murderers were last seen
crossing the Arizona canal just north of
Phoenix. Two stopped at a ranch near
there and changed norses, holding off the
owner at the revolver's point. At the
Thoroldsen ranch, three miles further
on. the other two tried the same trick.
Thoroldsen was away from home, but his
wife drove the raiders away, firing five
shots, killing one of the horses and
wounding dne of the party.

complaint in Judge Cabaniss' court yes

a charge of grand larceny. The warrant
was placed in the hands of Detective Rosa

business and run it together. She had
every confidence In Sampson. Thursday
he called on her and they went out to look
after some desirable investment. She felt
tired after getting home and complained
of a headache. She lay down on the sofa
In her room and Sampson left, promising
to return again to see how she was get
ting along.

under the sofa cushion for safety. She
dozed off, and when she awoke about 11

after she was asleep and had gone Into
her room. She was satisfied that he had
stolen her purse.
â¢ Sampson registered at the Golden "West
Hotel when he came to the city, but De
tective Whittaker found that he had left
there, and the presumption Is that he has
gone to parts unknown.

Dennis Sullivan's Mistake.
Dennis Sullivan, a shoemaker on Second
street, near Mission, was charged in Judge
Cabaniss 1 court yesterday with discharg
ing firearms within the city limits. The
evidence showed that Dennis on Thursday
night got into a saloon en Dupont street
and was robbed. The robbers followed
him to his home. He ran inside and, seiz
ing his shotgun, returned to the street,
but the robbers had fled. In his excite
ment the gun went off and he was arrest

Young Lawyer Involves Himself in
Difficulties "With Two Pcrw
erful Organizations.
Edward W. Closo, a young lawyer of
this city, is under the phadow of the
gravest eufpicicn by two of the prominent
fraternal organizations cf the Stater Close
is accused of having misappropriated
the funds of both societies and until yes
terday he deliberately evaded any effort
to make an explanation. He ' appeared
yesterday and declared that he would be
able to account for the money which was
entrusted to his keeping.
The lirst offense of the accused man
Â¦was committed in connection with the af
fairs of Perseverance Lodge of the An
cient Order of United Workmen, of which
Close was secretary. This lodge was
Fusperidod by the Grand Lodge because of
its failure to pay its assessments. Inves
tigation showed that Close had collected
the money but had not turned It over
to the proper officers. The amount was
emali and fearing that a mistake had been
made one of the members made good the
shortage. The. second offense which Close
must yet explain was in reference to the
funds of Blazing Arrow Ixidge of Red
Men which the accused man organized.
He collected from many men initiation
fees which have not been properly ac
counted for, and for two weks the mem
bers have valiily demanded an explana
tion. Close reappeared yesterday and
6aid he could Fatisfactorily explain the
shortage. Unless he does so he will be
prosecuted.
CLOSE WAS TOO LOOSE
WITH FRATERNAL FUNDS
Evidence That He Committed Suicide
Will Be Presented at the
Inquest.
Relatives of the late Emil Rosenbaum,
the Van N^s avenue suicide, are making
a searching investigation into the manner
of his death, and are evidently proceeding
on the hypothesis that he might have
been murdered. In order to obtain evi
dence in the matter Carl Eisenschimel
went to the Morgue to inspect the note
left by the suicide, but the Morgue depu
ties refused to allow him to see it. It will
be produced at the inquest at 10 o'clock
this morning. Autopsy Surgeon Leland
has certified that death was caused by
fatty degeneration of the heart and "prob
ably hydrocyanic poisoning" as the odor
of that/ drug was very pronounced. The
chemist's report which will be made to
the Coroner to-day and the testimony of
the druggist who sold hydrocyanic acid
to Rosenbaum will be offered to prove the
theory of suicide.

THE California Drydock Company has
conveyed all its Mission Rock and
Hunters Point property to two cor
porations. Mission Rock goes to the
Mission Rock Company, which corpora
tion secures altogether 14.35 acres. The
Hunters Point property has been con
veyed to the San Francisco Drydock Com
pany. The last mentioned transfer In
cludes land, water and water rights and
in fact all the property of the California
Drydock Company, floating docks being
in the lot. The consideration put on record
is J10 in each case. William Babcock, pres
ident of the California Drydock Company,
explains, that the transfers simply consti
tute another phase of the simplification
of the company's affairs. The docks prop
erty will all be bonded by the new dock
company and the wharf property by the
Mission Rock Company. The stockholders
in the two companies will be practically
the same as In the old California Drydock
Company. It is a long time since San
Francisco property was sold on the acre
age basis. This is the explanation of the
transfer, which on the records looks for
midable.
The Real Estate Record, published by
G. H. Umbsen & Co., summarizes the
loans and repayments for the first live
.months of the present year as follows:

Speaking of the causes which will add
to the greatness of San Francisco, the
Real Estate Record says that the Im
proved Australian and Tahiti service to
be guppiicil by the Oceanic Steamship
Company beginning November 1 will have
an ellect that will soon become apparent.
"The Oceanic Steamship Company will
experience the first benefits of this in
creased trade, but San Francisco in gen
eral will likewise participate in the growth
cf business thus brought about. These
changes, mark an epoch in the history of
this port and Indicate its growth as a
great commercial city â to be in a .short
time the metropolis of the eastern coast
ot the Pacific, as New York is the me
Â¦ tropoiis of the western shore of the At
lantic."
The sales of the week have not been
as large as during the preceding seven
days. There are several large transac
; tio'ns that may soon be closed. The fact
! remains true that it is easier to make a
large deal in business property than a
small one In residence property. The Von
Rhein Company has sold for $30,000 the
northwest corner of Montgomery avenue
and Green street, fronting 90 feet on
Montgomery avenue and 7S feet on Green
street. On the lot is a two-story building
containing stores and lodging house, rent
ing for fc.70 per month. The seller Is O.
M. Goldarecena and the purchaser George
C. Alfreitr.
Sarah E. Gouldin has sold \e A. C.
Hlndman. through Bovee, Toy & Sonntag,
the southwest corner of Valencia and Hill
streets for $50,000. 1 he lot is 114x135 feet.
Upon it is a store and flat building.
Bovee Toy & Sonntag have sold for E.
M. Helnn a tract of thirty acres across
the bay at Piedmont, next to the William
J. Dingee tract. The price paid Is JSO.O'JO
at the rate of $1000 per acre. The pur
chaser is P. S. Goldman.
The improvement of Telegraph Hill is
treated by Marsden Manson In the Mer
chants' Association Review. He linds
that there are streets on the hill that
have excavated sixty and eighty feet be
low the official grade^as on Green street
between Sansome and Montgomery and
on Wlnthrop street between Kearny.
Montgomery. Chestnut and Lombard
streets. This grading will, if continued,
Mr Manson says, in time excavate other
streets below official grade and will de
stroy Pioneer Park, as far as present ele
vation and grades are concerned. He fa
vors the establishment of one or more
streets located upon light frades and
fitted to the topography of the hill. He
cgyg â¢
"de'veral such strtets (such as are men
tioned in the preceding paragraph) are
possible, starting from advantageous
points and reaching the summit upon
grades of from 6 to 6 per cent (5-100 or
6-100). The easterly face of the hill can
be treated eo as to give permanent slopes
and at the same time permit of grading
property on the east base of the hill. This
latter project is possible, and the pre
liminarv studies already made indicate
that it "is advisable. Whenever time and
means shall admit a definite study can
be made which will determine the princi
pal features and approximate cost.
Building contracts filed during the past
week were as follows: Enterprise Brew

Reunion of Class
of '96.
s *
"Juniors" and "middlerE" held "jinks"
at the G!r!s f High School yesterday after
r.oon. They danced and r r a-ttlcd, sang
ar.d made merry as or-ly sweet schoolgirls
know how. It was a grala day in the history
cf the two classes. It was a sort of a joint
celebration In honor of both classes
. assuming higher studies and ascending
ar.othcr rung- of the ladder which will
eventually lead to graduation. Staid
echoolma'ams watclied over the flock of
young ladies ar;fi w hen two young men
attempted to enter the sacred portals
of the auditorium they were shooed away
as if they vrere Ill-omened birds of prr-y.
The fr'.Â£h school spielers are already
xsaking tht'r blandishments felt. As spe
cial guests cf Loth classes the ninth
grade grammar school misuses who will
Â«?nter high school at the beginning of
next term were present in larcc numbers
as honored guests. Thoy were danced
and feted by the "juniors" and "mld
dlers," and entered into the "jinks" with
a.1. the spirit of old scholars.
It was aa easr matter to distinguish
the "junior" and the "middler." as they
are termed in the red brick building at
Geary and Scott etreets. All "juniors"
wore their hair up and had frizzes, curls
covering their high foreheads. The "mid
dlers," although a few years older, looked
much younger v.ith their hair hanging
down their short waists in jrtrly, girly
fashion. Some wore psyche knots and
double braids, while others wore their
locks in a knot heavy enough to keep
their heads back.
MIfs Leila Samuels played all the
inarches she knew and the young ladies
danced two steps- until she was tired of
her contract. Each girl was armed with,
a dainty programme, on which was jot
ted down the name of the "man" with
whom she was to dance.
Intermingled with the dancing were
sonps bv Miss Katherine Black. Miss
Eleana Koeckel and Miss Edith Gordan.
Miss Cera Cleveland and Miss Celia
Friedman won deserved applause by their
excellent recitations, and Mrs. Prag, one
of the most popular teachers in the insti
tution, delig-hted the girls with a short
narrative of her experiences as a high
school pirl.
Promptly at 3 o'clock the pianist ren
dered "Home, Sweet Home, and like
dutiful school pirls. the merrymakers
tiled out mid home, leaving the hall in
the keeping of the class of 'S6. The mem-
T>ers of that class, to the number of fifty,
returned to do honor to their alma mater.
Nearly a score of the young women pres
ent were either graduates of the Univer
sity of California or about tQ graduate.
Some were married and had their babes
Â¦with them. Th<re was dancing and sing
ing and refreshments were served. The
success of this class reunion was due to
the efforts of Miss G. G. Hawkins, Miss
Alice Marsh and Miss Mcinlnger.

The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs addressed an open letter to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday of which
the following is a copy:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors, City
and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen: The
budget adopted by the honorable Board of 1
Supervisors is a disappointment to the people
who have been laboring zealously for the
growth and advancement of San Francisco.
Our hope for a better condition of affairs has
proved a disappointment. The majority of
the Supervisors, although pledged previous to
the election "to a liberal policy of public im
provements." has neglected its opportunity and
plain duty. The failure of Boards of Super
visors In the past to appropriate funds to make
preliminary improvements in the outlying
districts was recognized as a loss to the city
In that Its growth westerly was retarded.
Cities across the bay. have been getting the
surplus population" while our suburban dis
tricts have been waiting- for the funds, to open
streets and sewers and thereby make these
localities habitable. We had looked for a new
era on the adoption of the present charter
and the election of officials pledged to "a
liberal policy of public Improvements, economy,'
home rule and civil service."/ We flnd, how
ever, our officials have been liberal only to
the taxeaters. Public improvements aeem a
secondary consideration and, yet worse, have
been entirely Ignored.
We believe that the multiplication of high
salaried officials Is responsible in a large meas
ure, if not wholly, for the costly administra
tion under the new charter. The new im
provements so urgently required are to be
delayed and we see that no relief is to be
obtained from the present Board of Super
visors. Our only remedy Is through amend
ments to the charter and we therefore favor
the resolution presented to your honorable
board that a committee of three be appointed
by the Mayor to draft amendments to the
charter for the purpose of reducing the ex
penses of administration, and also that section
making provision for a particular fund to be
designated the 'â¢public improvement fund."
which shall be devoted exclusively in the mak
ing of public ' improvements and which fund
shall not be less than Â£>00,000 per annum.
We stand ready and are anxious to co
operate In this work and have under con
sideration a plan somewhat on the same lines
which we intend to agitate and get the opinion
of the people thereon. Respectfully,
A. S. LILLIE,
President Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs.

port to his family. Not that he did not
struggle continuously to do his part, but
he was overgenerous, dreamy, easily im
posed upon and utterly lacking In the
sense of proportion. Wherever you find
his type in a family you invariably find
his antithesis, trained in necessity s mill
to oppose and counterbalance the unprac
tical. Mrs. Alcott and Louisa represented
this contrary tendency, the mother brave
ly supporting her husband's theories even
when not entirely in sympathy with them.
Louisa mildly satirizing her fathers
views In her story. "Transcendental wna
Oats." and giving her youth, her strength
and her life to meet the harvest of debts
which these impractical theories reaped.
During the financial panics which as
sailed this happy family Kmerson was i tnÂ»
stanch financial friend, leaving his eifts
Ufcostentatiously under a candlestick, in
the leaves of a book or on a table. It
always hurt Louisa's pride that the fam
ily were obliged to take this kindly prof
fered help, and had It not been that she
knew how much Emerson honored her
good father she could hardly have
brought herself to accept it. It took her
nearly twenty-five years to pay off all the
familv debts, but she finally succeeded in
canceling every one, even those that were
outlawed. Emerson was her idol, ana
during what she terms her sentimental
age slie wrote him long letters after thq
manner of the Bettina-Goethe correspond
ence, but could never screw up her cour
age to send them and finally destroyed
them all. .. . ..
The vegetarian diet upon which the
family subsisted was at least an econom
ical one, and although the family often
wearied of the plain boiled rice and gra
ham bread without milk or butter. Louisa
and her older sister thrived on the plain
fare; neither of the younger sisters im
mortalized in "Little Women" as Beth
and Amy, gained strength from the mo
notonous diet. Had Louisa not been so
phenomenally strong she never could
have accomplished what she did even
with the best intentions In the world.
Taught by their kind father, encouraged
ond helped by their warm-hearted mother,
Vhe Alcott children led a perfectly Joyous
existence at Concord, unmindful of the
impending financial storm. TUth plent>
of housework, doll's dressmaking and
play-acting in the barn, they lived in the
enchanted land of make-believe or romped
with the little Emersons, Channlngs and
Hawthornes. "Pilgrims journeyed over
the hill," writes Louisa, the ringleader,
"with scrip and staff and cockleshells in
their hats; fairies held their pretty revels
among the whispering birches, and straw
berry parties in the rustic, arbor were hon
ored by poets and philosophers, who fed
us on their wit and wisdom while the lit
tle maids served more mortal food. Â¦.
In a poem written when 11 years old to
her mother. Louisa Alcott forecasts the
impetus which kept her working so many
years:
I hope that soon, dear mother,
You and I may be
In the uulet room my fancy
Has so often made for thee. Â¦
Vhlle I sit close beside you,
Content at last to gee
That you can rest, dear mother.
And I can cherish thee
From the time she was 15 she launched
forth on an Independent career, full of
trials and privations. Teaching school,
sewing, nursing invalids and going out to
service were a few of the many occupa
tions at which she tried her hand. Several
times she came very near going on the
stage; arrangements were made and the
parts assigned, but some unforeseen ac
cident always blocked the fulfillment of
her cherished ambitions. . In the light of
her subsequent career as" an author, pos
terity must rejoice that her histrionic
hopes were nipped Id the bud. : '.
At the age of 23 her first little book.
"Flower Fables." written when she was
only 16, to amuse Emerson's daughter,
found its way into print. It brought but
$32 Into "the Alcott sinking fund." but
was regarded as a sign of promise. She
sent it to the well beloved mother with
this characteristic note: "Dear Motherâ
Into your Christmas stocking I have put
my'first born.' knowing that you will ac
cept it with all its faults (for grandmoth
ers are always kind), and look upon it
merely, as an earnest of what I may yet
do." .In the following February she. re
ceived $5 for her first story, and for soma
years after wrote these exciting little
"pot-boilers." supplementing her routine
sewing with- these really inferior tales.
It was not until two yenrs afterward that
she could write in her journal. "The lnsids
of my head can at. least! cover: the out
side."
In a letter to her"father she says: '"I
can't do much with my hands, , so I. will
really lived most of it and if it succeeds
that will be the reason of It." No one
was more surprised than the author at
the phenomenal success of the book; the
sweet family spirit, the delights and
romps, the' blessedness of sacrifice and
the genuine wholesomeness of "Little
Women" proved that the literary disci
pline of the last ten years had not been
in vain and that the extreme naturalness
of her characters entitled them to the
warm welcome given them by the child
hood of America. France, England, Ger
many and Holland.
With the family finally out of debt, the.
beloved "Marmee" surrounded with every
comfort, "to be cherished and helped
tenderly down the long hill she had
climbed so bravely Â¦with her many bur
dens." and the younger sister- studying
art in Europe, it would seem as if the
overworked author might at last rest on
her oars. But no. the habit of self-abne
gation. of driviilg- work, had become a
necessity to her and she complied as far
as possible with the steadily increasing
demands of the publishers. Consequently
she records: "Write three pages at once
on impression paper, as Beecher, Roberts
and Low of London all want copy at
once." and then the telltale footnote
added some years later: "This was the
cause of the paralysis of my thumb,
which disabled me for the rest of my
life." The funny side Of everything ap
pealed to Her just as In her heydey years.
and we find her In her forty-first year
writing to her mother this account of a
grave meeting: "Had a very transcen
dental day yesterday and at night my
head was 'swelling visibly' with the ideas
cast Into it. The club was a funny mix
ture of rabbis and needy old ladles, the
'oversoul' and oysters. Papa and B. flew
clean out of sight like a pair of piatonic
balloons and we tried to follow, but
couldn't."
With her cherished purpose of support-
Ing the family always In view she
seemed in love with her lot and among
the delicious outbursts in her journal
there are no complainings or envious com
parisons with the more fortunate career
of the sister whom *he was educating
abroad. Occasionally there is an eloquent
sentence like this: "She (Anna) is a happy
woman! I sell my children and, though
they feed me, they don't love me as hers
do." In the midst of her work she took
a year's vacation abroad, vlsltlns with
May and relaxing a little until she heard
in Italy of the death of John. Meg's hus
band in "Little Women." She wa3 great
ly shocked, for she loved and honored this
noble brother, and she Immediately set vo
Â¦work upon a new book -which should put
his wife and children beyond the clutches
of poverty. "Little Men" was the result;
50,000 copie3 were sold before Its publica
tion and this sequel to "Little Women"
was as eagerly awaited as war or stock
bulletins. Although she declared by thia
time that her brain was squeezed dry, she
wrote "Eight Cousins" and its sequel.
"Rose in Bloom," "Under the Lilacs" and
numberless short stories for the leading
Juvenile magazines. "When the artist sis
ter died abroad a short time after her
marriage her little girl baby came acros3
the ocean to make her home with the
loving Aunt Louisa, for whom she was
named. For eight years this little one
was a heart-gladdener to the faithful over
worked woman who was now almost at
the finish of her life work.
Mrs. Alcott had died in her daughter's
arms; her father was nearing his ninetieth
year, happy and appreciative of her poem
to him beginning:
Dear Pilgrim, waiting patiently
The long, long journey nearly done.
She was tenderly devoted to him m his

and proud of his pride In her. as evidenced

In spite of the sadness of this life so

XVII. LOTTISA MAY ALCOTT.
(1832-188.) '
BY CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN
j Those who would thoroughly under
stand the childhood of Louisa M. Alcott
have but to read "Little Women," "Little
Men," "Jo's Boys" and the other juvenile
books wherein the joys, work, romps and
sorrows of the Alcott family are faith
fully portrayed. As Jo, the lovable tom
boy, strong in will, awkward in body, Im
pulsive In thought, moody, high-spirited
and noble-hearted, she has charmed,
amused and interested the children of two
generations, and as long as frank and
natural childhood, with its struggles and
victories, is rightly estimated so ldng will
succeeding generations continue to enjoy
her original books.
From her mother, Abba May. Louisa
May Alcott inherited her keen sense of
humor, her passionate devotion to her
family and her brave tendency to make
the best of things; from her father she
Inherited her uncommon mind, her pure
mlndedness and love of philanthropy. A.
Bronson Alcott, the devoted friend of Em
erson, who called him "the American
Plato," was a man of singular upright
ness of character, gentleness and piatonic
wisdom, who apparently understood the
tenets of transcendentalism far better
than the mulplication table. So serenely
unpractical was this charming man that
during the greater part of his life he was
a distinct financial drag, rather than sup-
make a battering ram of my head and
make a way through this rough-and
tumble world." That she was able to use
all parts of her body is well proved by
her records of a day's work, consisting of
the family housework in the morning,
followed by a twenty-mile walk; in ths
afternoon more housework and two $o0
stories written for the Youth's Compan
ion, and a ball in the evening. To these
duties she added that of nurse of the fam
ily. She gave up her work in Boston to
care for the invalid sister who died In her
arms. . Mother, father and other slster3
were coaxed through many an illness by
her tender ministrations. It was. there
fore, but natural that at the time of the
Civil War Louisa's smoldering patriotism
should find expression in an ardent wish
to devote her knack at nursing to her
wounded countrymen.
For six weeks she tended the sick and
dying and thea she succumbed to ty
phoid pneumonia. Home nursing brought
her back from the delirium in whtch Â«hÂ«>
had raged for a month, but she wa* never
really well again. Her "Hospital Sketches."
made up largely of home letters, had
an Immense sale; so that the young au
thor, then 30 years old. found that al
though she had stropped back to a world
of unceasing lnvalldism It nevertheless
hel<I out the golden promise through
which her sacred mission to her 'family
was to be fulfilled.
The success of her "Hospital Sketches"
led Roberts Brothers to ask Miss Alcott
to write a story for girl3. This she was
bo sure that she could not do that she
wrote them a book to prove it. In this
work she drew largely on the dear life
of "The' Pathetic Family." as she humor
ously called the home people, and handed
it dubiously to the publisher, saying: "We

The Supervisors* joint committee on ju

to the Board of Supervisors that the Hall
of Justice building be accepted by the
city upon the Flgnlr.g of a proper release
by the contractors and their bondsmen of
a!l claims growing out of the erection of
Â» :ne building rr the carrying out of the
contract of 1S97 or subsequent contracts
modifying it.
It was also decided to frame a resolu
tion directing the Auditor to pay out of
a balance of $12,232 in the money set aside
Sor erecting the structure certain claims
r.eld by employes who have been engaged
in mailing alterations in the buildinp.
Chairman Dwrer stated that work had
ccen performed by day laborers, and that
they had not been paid as yet. He In-
Fietcd that they were entitled to their pay
ano the committee agreed with him.
J. F. Kennedy, repre? entin? the Pacific

give the city any bond for claims which

Kateman Bros. The committee was not
deposed to accept the building unless a
release cf al! claims against the construc
tion fund was presented by this flra or

COURT NOTES.
The dispute between Tax Collector Scott
and the National Athletic Club over the
revocation qf the former's 'license to con
duct sparring exhibitions was submitted
to Judge Murasky for decision yesterday.
The application of E. C. Kilpatrick. the
late principal of the Â¦ Business Eyeningr
School, for a judicial review of the action
of the Board of Education dismissing him
from his position was argued' before
Judge Murasky yesterday. General
Barnes, who represented Kilpatrick. 'con
tended that the board lacked jurisdiction
to dismiss hlft client, as the charges of
misconduct against him were not formally
filed by Superintendent Webster. Assist
ant City Attorney Brobeck filed a demurr
er to Kilpatrick s petition and the court
took the matter under advisement. -N
The application of Samuel Rehfisch. do
ing business under the firm name of O. M.
Kutz & Co., for a writ of injunction re
straining James Galway and others from
boycotting: his shoe manufacturing estab
lishment or otherwise injuring him, was
submitted for decision to Judge Seawell
yesterday.
from legal cause and does not take away the
right to collect salaries for such period. We
agree also with the conclusion of City Attor
ney Lone holding that the Board of Fire Com
missioners may prant leaves of absence to
members of the Fire Department, but we do
not find anything similar to It in the chapters
on other departments.
As to the County Clerk, Sheriff, Recorder,
District Attorney and Coroner, it may be
claimed that they are officers whose powers
and duties are given by the county government
act or other general laws, and for that rea
scn cannot be controlled by the provisions of
the charter to which reference has been made.
For these reasons we advise that you ure not
authorized to audit any demand for the salary
of any employe of the city and county, except
as we have stated, accruing 1 while such em

head of his department and not in the actual

Another rrovinlon reads that no demand shall
b* allowed by the Auditor In favor of any cJty
emnlovÂ»s for the time he shall have absented
himself' without legal cause during office hours.
It is then apparent that at least legal causs
must exlet as an excuse for absence. We recog
nize that 'Â¦legal cause" exists whenever by rea
son of holidays tbe public offices are closed,
hut we fall to find In the charter any authority
riven to any department to grant leave of ab

Auditor Wells received yesterday, from
his attorneys. Lloyd & Wood, an opinion
In reply to his inquiry "Can any of the
deputies, clerks or other employes of the
city and county be allowed pay for time
of absence from duty when on vacation
leave?" In their opinion the attorneys
hold that the charter provides that no
employe of the city and county shall be
paid for a eriater time than that covered
by his actual service and that it would
be a violation of the charter to allow com

NEW YORK, June 8.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Dullness and
speculative hesitation have increased to such
an extent that the only word . applicable to
the market this week. Is stagnant. The public
Is .practically out of the proceedings and the
stocks on. the New York board represent in
the main an exchange . of contracts between
the smaller professional operators. The Lon
don market was slightly stimulated at ! the
beginning of the week by the news that the
British army had occupied . Pretoria, but this
Influence did not last long or result' In any
decided buying of American stocks for foreien
account. On the contrary the bullish news
from South Africa was promptly nullified bv
the threatening aspect of affairs In China and
by the heavy fall of values and money market
pressure. that have developed In Berlin, makln?
that city something of a storm center in the
financial world. In fact the foreign influences
were adverse and seemed to have considerable
to do with the prevalent disposition of our
own market to wait the course of events The
fact that foreign exchange holds steady with
its recent decline is a favorable circumstance
and relieves New York : from the ; danger of
gold withdrawals unless the pending coniDl!
cations at Berlin should grow Into a panicâ
rather an unlikely contingency. Meantime the
decreased activity of trade in various- lines
and the shutting down of manufacturing -es
tablishments Influenced the financial ultuation
by causing idle money to flow and accumulate
Et New York. Distinct ' evidence of this has
been afforded by the bank statements of the
last two Saturdays and in the increasing ease
of money as reflected in the demand for and
high prices of prime bonds and the dividend
paying railroad - stocks. Such securities and
large amounts of mere speculative stocks also
have accumulated - In strong â¢ hands Â« and there
seems, to be no general distribution of. specu
lative holdings ;ln quarters where liquidation
â¢ would be the result of -continued dullness, or
effective bearish pressure. Railroad earnings
continue to make, favorable comparisons -with
the figures of a' year ago. 'and It Is, thought
that, the contraction, of the. activity and -the
reduction of prices In the iron trade have reme
died the situation in' that quarter and that
a. turn for the better Is likely to be seen.'- The
facts seem to be that' the public â¢ and street
are both â¢ Influenced by the slacking of Â¦, trade

NEW YORK, June 8.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The adjournment *of Congress after a success
ful session, the progress toward peace in South
Africa and the rapid adjustment of prices here
to a more natural level tend to bring nearer
the day of greater activity. But progress
has not been rapid, and the yielding of prices
affects many as a reaction, cutting off part
of the profits supposed to have been secured.
The impression grows also that no extensive
changes in business are >, now probable until
after the Presidential election and the pos
sibility of trouble In China has at least as
definite an Influence on American affairs as
any change in South Africa. The unsettled
condition of labor controversies, moreover,
operates strongly lor the, time to limit ex
pansion of domestic business. â¢ Yet the volume
of business Is so large that a few months of
waiting could not excite any apprenenslon.
It is but a few days since a prominent Iron
master'overwhelmed doubts and questions by
the positive declaration that any decline what
ever In the price of iron this year was simply
Impossible, yet anthracite -No. 1 has declined
J4 25 per ton and this week the Bessemer As
sociation has reduced Its price at Pittsburg
$4 60 per ton and the Southern makers $2 per
ton. The decline in ratio of prices of pig iron
from 112.7 in January to 93.6 this week and
in the- finished products from 9S.05 to 80.01
does "not In fact show the entire change, as
'the steel and wire companies' guarantee of
prices In case of further reduction respecting
products not then shipped is In effect a con
cession. A few large contracts are reported,
but the new business Is so small that many
works are stopping or reducing their force. The
minor metals and coke are weaker. Petroleum
r>as again been reduced to $7 So, against $9 90
April 4, and rubber to 86c. against $1 04 In
March. Silk and hemp are both lower. Wooh
has not declined further, but Is weak and In
small demand, many of the mills having in
adequate orders for goods. Still more Im
portant Is the fall in cotton to JS SI. against
$9 87 a month ago, which Is also due In part
to restricted demand for goods at the ad
vanced prices asked. The statement often
made that the textile mills are running full
time does not appear accurate; the production
is heavy but by no means full. Mldos have
declined further this week, both packer hides
at Chicago and dry hides here, and the de
cline in this important material has been over
20 per cent, while In leather it has not aver
aged S per cent. The boot and shoe, manu
facturers maintain that they cannot accept
lower prices than those they have asked until
leather yields much more and the closing of
many works Indicates that the embarrassment
Is serious.
The rise of 2Mc in wheat, attributed to In
juries threatening a short movement next fall,
affected stocks also somewhat. Exports do not
materially change, having been for the first
week of June from Atlantic ports, including
flour, 2.805,261 bushels, against 1.849,373 bushels
last year: from Pacific ports, 591,015 bushels,
against 623,400 bushels last year. Receipts of
both wheat and corn have fallen, considerably
below those of last year, though not as yet
enough to indicate a sense of scarcity in in
terior supplies. ' ,: . nn . ,
Failures for the week have been 206 in the
United States, against 159 last year, and 19 in
Canada, against 10 last year.

WHEATâ The market seems to be working
Into better shape all over the world.
Liverpool and Paris were both . higher. The
condition of the Russian crop was reported
satisfactory, but not flattering.
Chicago was very bullish and Corn advanced
on Increased speculation and a good shipping
demand. Wheat eased oft somewhat on pre
dicted showers in the Northwest, but a reliable
Minneapolis dealer wired a damage of 50 per
cent In the Northwest, with rain needed to
save the balance of the crop. Subsequently
the market became excited and irrejirular. with
holders selling freely. but repurchasing on
every break. The weather continued unfavor
able, with Increasing complaints from the
Northwest. The condition of the Kansas crop
was given at 101.

I shares was coincident with the deliberations of
the committee appointed by the presidents of
W*>stern railroads to concoct a plan for di
vision of traffic cave force to the supposition
that the prospect for a satisfactory settlement
is net very good. Faillnp In such a settlement
there is Mtiti to be a likeiihood of a widespread
and costly rate war. Coming In combination
with the- bad reports from the wheat country,
this Fcrvcd to effectually break the market and
price* went to pieces In the last half hour of
the trading:, the weakness Fpreading from the
Grangers, Pacifies and Southwestern into the
. trunk lines and specialties and embracing the
wholo list. This break came after a day cf
I-ersister.t dullness and lrrejjular fluctuations
in prices. The Incident immediately preceding
the brtak was an advance of over a point in
Iteauir.g first preferred, with confident absorp
tion of very large offerings. The second pre
ft-rrtd was all wiped out in the final break. An
increase in the earnings of Northern Pacific of
-S per cent for the fourth week in May did
not avail to save that stock from the break on
the unfavorable crcp prospects and it fell two
points. Mi-nourl 1'aciflc and Baltimore and
Ohio showed weakness before the general break
on general fears of disappointment regarding
dividends. There was a relaxation of the pres
sure en foreign markets, due to apprehension
ever the trouble in China, ar*i London bought
stocks here to a moderate extent,- causing some
Flight rains early in the day. The preliminary
estimates of the bank statement ficrure out a
small loss in cash owing to ths week's heavy
to f3.117.O"U > all on account of the cajl by the
Treasury of Government deposits in the banks.
The estimate* of receipts from the interior are
slightly In excess of those made last Friday,
but it was remembered that last Friday's esti
mates foil rhort by $1,500,000 of the actual re
ceipts, so that a rain in cash In to-morrow's '
statement would not be surpri?ing. The mar- !
ket <-losÂ«-d active and. weak at about the lowest.
The t -nd market was very dull and price
chancres were remarkably small. Total sales, |

CHICAGO, June's.â July wheat opened at 71Â®
71V4e, a flat Jump from yesterday's close of
U@t4c. Then began a trade which." in excite
ment and , volume exceeded even yesterday's,
when traders were referring to the days of the
Lelter deal for comparisons. The advance was
occasioned by the fact. that the Northwest was
still without rain." Realizing sales were
heavy, however, and July, following the open-
Ing, declined to 7054c. Then the pressure of
buying orders, bunches of which every man In
the pit seemed to have in the greatest plenty,
came to .the aid of the market and July shot
up to 71%c. Lots, which during the refent
dullness would have caused a' break In prices,
were absorbed without * a tremor. At this
point the .Weather Bureau announcement of In
dications of 6howers for, the Northwest Satur
day caused some cessation In the buying and
the takers of profit forced July gradually back
to 7054c The dip, however, merely gave the
buyers a breathing spell, | for at the price
quoted they Jumped Into the pit with renewed
vigor. Northwestern interests bought enor
mous quantities, as did Influential locals.
Some who went short early upon the theory
that the advance of yesterday would in the
natural course of things be followed by a
reaction covered, this aiding in the advance.
Trading during the last hour was very heavy.
July climbed up to 72%c and closed 2%c Im
proved at 72%@72%c. Cables were strong. The
spring wheat territory reported the crop situa
tion becoming more "critical. High winds
and sand yesterday, it was said, did further
damage to the North Dakota crop. Through
out the entire session the Northwest bought
persistently and heavy. Naturally there was a
great deal, of liquidating, but the small part
the Northwest took in this was notable and a
factor In the spurt which came when the ses
sion came to a close.
Corn was dull and easy during . the first
of the advance in wheat, but became very ac
tive later. The pit had been deserted in favor
of wheat until some buying. orders brought out
the fact that there was little for sale. In a
few minutes July went up over a cent a bushel
and once started the shorts were not to be de
nied. July sold between 3S%@40%e. closing 1&
@l%c improved at 40@40VÂ»c.
Oats, like corn, lagged early, but later
braced up and closed strong. Trade was light.
July closed Vic better at 22c.
The provisions market was firm In sympathy
with wheat and corn. The .opening was firm.
There was a fair demand, but offerings in the
pit were fairly liberal. July pork closed 7V4C
over yesterday, July lard 5c higher and July

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
fesslonal operators while trying several times
during the day to undermine prices I met their
matches and were obliged to retreat. in the last
hour when highest prices of the session were
attained. Crop damage reports from spring
wheat States are undoubtedly very bullish, but
there Is some question as to whether the ad
vance : has not; been too rapid under the cir
cumstances. July wheat went up from 75%c
early In the day to V%c in the late afternoon,
closing at 77Hc Foreign houses also proved
good Â¦ buyers of the staple and general senti
ment was strongly in favor of higher prices,
should rain be withheld much longer from the
spring wheat belt. Operations In the option
market reached a total of about 5,000,000 bush
els for the day. which Is the heaviest business
done In . a year or more. ' >*-*Â¦ iV/
+ . . 'Â¦ -f
effects of the approaching Presidential' elec
tion. The unfavorable development in' the crop
outlook at -the Northwest has also been a
factor, r while the continued weakness of the
steel stocks and the closing of more i mills
with lower quotations for . the products of the
iron industry aid in holding Â»peculatlve senti
ment in comple'te- check. , At the same time
the floating supply of stocks is small, the
market becomes easily oversold and after bear
operators apply pressure to cause lower prices
the succeeding rallies, while not long, are
sharp and rapid.
Bradstrcet's on Trade.
NEW YORK, June 8.â Bradstrect's to-mor
row will say: New business at wholesale Is
of a between-statlons character, but warmer
weather has offered a stimulus to retail busi
ness in some sections. Chief activity and
most attention are, however, still' concentrated
on the price situation and efforts to readjust
quotations to meet current demand and supply
conditions go forward steadily. Tha exception
to the general downward trend of prices Is
that furnished by leading farm products,
notably cereals, but here the moving cause Is
hardly favprable, being the result of less satis
factory crop reports, particularly from the
Northwest, and It Is to be noted that advices
from the Central West, where the winter
wheat ' yield promises to be very short, are
also less favorable. The Northwest has had
someraim, but, it Is claimed, not enough to
render the situation free of danger. Corn crop
conditions remain favorable, as likewise do
those of oats, . but the grain and hog products
have sympathized In the upward movement
of wheat,- which has at last broken from Its
lethargy and Is again attracting speculative
attention. Foreign crop advices, It might be
added, are not nattering. The German rye
crop promises to be very short; the same re
port comes regarding French wheat, and Eng
lish crop advices are not of the best.
If, as has been claimed, lower prices for
Iron favor an Increased consumption, current
developments In this trade may be classed as
favorable because concessions are being stead
ily made In nearly every branch of trade. The
price of Bessemer pig and steel billets for
the last half of 1900 1 has been agreed upon,
the result being a drop of 16 per cent In pig
iron and of 20 per cent In billets from the. old
nominal quotations, which, however, have not
been closely adhered -to of late. Southern Iron
advices are of shading In quotations in sym
pathy with similar action taken at Pittsburg.
Chicago and other iron market*. Prices at
Birmingham are now on a parity with those
of Europe, freight charges considered, and
here, as In the North, . the possibility of. labor
tests Intrudes Itself.
Cotton is slightly, weaker. Cotton goods are
dull. Wool is dull and on the whole slightly
weaker' at Eastern markets. Men's wear
goods reorders are of fair volume, while mills
engaged on women's wear goods are fairly well
employed. The outlook favors lower prices for
the new spring weights. Â¦
Little that Is new comes from the shoe busi
ness. Leather Is dull and 1 rather weak^ Price
shadlngs are reported the rule in lumber and
this,- coupled 'Â¦ with low water In the North
west, it is hoped may restrict new production.
Surplus visible wheat supplies are decreas
ing rapidly, lending Interest to current un
favorable crop reports. The decrease In Amer
ican stocks, as reported to Bradstreet'a in
May, was 1.1,330.000 bushels, ncrtlnst a falling
off of 0,033,000 bushels In April. Supplies In
Europe, Australia and Argentina also de
creased, though to "a much less marked extent
and the result Is an aggregate world's sup
ply on June 1 of 143.SS3.O0O bushels, a supply
of 15.665,000 bushels less than on May 1, and
comparing with a decrease in May a year ago
of less than" 1,000,000 bushels, and two years
ago of an increase of nearly 2,oCfl,000 bushels.
The decrease In American and European sup
plies is the largest reported In any month
since 1S9S, and Is the largest reported In May
since 1S95.
- Business failures number 184, as compared
with 135 last week, 178 In this week a year
ago, 221 in 1838, 216 In 1S97 and 274 In 1898.
There were 96 failures in Canada in May.

one from Australia. 31C2 tons: total. BLS1 tons.
The liberal- deliveries this week will provide
generously for all immediate requirements ami
reave a small quantity over to be yarded. The
engagement list of Coal carriers from Australia
Is enlarging, as there are forty-seven vessels
chartered, with a carrying capacity of 113,000
tons. - There are fifty-one vessels listed from
there for Honolulu, with 87.000 tons. This evi
dences an Influx of Colonial fuel later in the
year, nnd it will come to a good market, aa
there la none here In Jobbers' hands at present.
All that Is leading has already passed out of
first hands. The extreme rates new being of
fered for outward grain carriers shouM leal to
liberal shipments from foreign sources, but ton
nape is wtarce in all Australian ports. Freight
rates from 'the coast on Coal remain firm, aa
Alaska is utilizing all the disengaged tonnage
for the moment; a few months hence this de
mand must diminish, and will ai.l shipments
here from British Columbia and Washington.
Prices remain unchanged and the demand la
brisk. The loading 1 or English and Swansea
products hss almost come to a standstill, as
the cost of Coal at these shipping poinu makes
It almost prohibitory."

never yet have seen anything to compare in in

the people of Alameda County well enough to
know that they will indorse the course of any
man who Is attacked, as Dalton has been, by
the enemies of good government and honesty in

DEPUTIES ARE DISMISSED.
County Clerk Frank C. Jordan to-day
revoked the appointments of all of the
deputy county clerks appointed for regis
tration purposes and announced that no
special deputies would be allowed in the
future.
JÂ»lr. Jordan says this action was taken
in order that his office may be relieved
from any possible charge that it Is being
used for political purposes. The regular
force of office deputies will do the work
hereafter and will visit the various sec
tions of the city and the county and take
registrations.
A number of appointments had been
made for the purpose of registration at
the request of candidates. These were all
revoked. The Metcalf men are not pleased
at this and say that Mr. Jordan is making
Mr. Dalton's right for Congress.
"Mr Jordan has revoked the appoint
ments of all of the deputies requested by
our side." said Paul SchatTer. one of Mr.
Metcalf's organizers. "If Mr. Jordan has
done this in order to clear himself from
a charge of favoring one side more than
the other he has >naade a mistake. Mr.
Jordan Is a noted partisan of Mr. Oalton,
and to refuse to appoint a few deputies
at our request will merely create tno
charge that he has thrown his office Into
politics. We are not going to do anything,
because we can't."

A county seat war of large proportions
Is on In Contra Costa County. The fight
is over a proposition to move the seat
from Martinez to Concord. The battle
was opened upon the projected construc
tion of a new courthouse, for which
1100.000 was appropriated by the Super
visors recently.
A petition with 2000 names attached has
been filed with the board urging that an
election be called at which the question of
removal may be submitted to the voters
of the county. It Is a. tight between the
east and the west ends of the county, â¢with
enough local politicians thrown in to stir
up a lively row.
Concordites have taken advantage of the
situation bv offering a flve-acre site and
a $30,000 cash bonus if the new courthouse
shall be located In their town. While the
petition before the Supervisors mentions
no speciiic location, it is known that the
general fight is between Concord and Mar
tinez. The interests favoring the reten
tion of the seat of government at Mar
tinez are strong and will not submit to a
removal without a struggle.
The contest on the whole is not a new
one. but through the offer from Concord
it has taken much more definite shape
than in the past. â¢
The Martinez people da not feel any
alarm concerning the controversy, as the
law requires a two-thjrds favorable vote
on a county seat removal. They do not
believe that such a majority can be se
cured. The bulk of population is on the
west side of the county. In which Martinez
is located. a
The petition Is now in the hands of the
District Attorney and the County Asses

OAKLAXD. June 8. â Interest In the marriage of Earl B. Hough and
Beatrice Singleton of San I>Â«andro. who were twice wedded within seven
months, has boon increased by the publicity which was given to the un
usuai features connected with the events. Though man and wife for many
<5ays. there was never a suspicion of the relation until the ymmg man
a week ago related the story of his wedding on the decks of the famous flag-
Ship Hartford at Mare Island.
Rather than be separated from his young bride, which seemed probable, as he
was to fri to the Sandwich Islands, the young man confided in his parents. The
mirriiFe aboard ship was by contract before the chaplain of the vessel. This did
not seem entirely satisfactory to either family, so the second ceremony was
duly celebrated at San Rafael.
All obstacles being removed, Mr. and Mrs. Hough will leave for Honolulu on
Jtme 27. with the satisfaction at least of having had the nuptial knot doubly
fastened
GRAND JTJEORS TALK
OAKLAND. June 8.â Alameda County
has been shaken by the Indictment
of County Assessor Dalton for the
destruction of public records as it
has never been shaken before. The in
dictment and the accusation f orchis Im
peachment eclipsed everything else In
point of interest In the county, and con
versation to-day has been only upon the
action of the Grand Jury and its offect.
The actual report of the Grand Jury
was soon lost signt of behind the possible
political effect of the indictment and pros
pective Impeachment. Mr. Dalton openly
charged that it was a political move, and
the specific charges of the two documents
returned by the Grand Jury were com
pletely overshadowed by the political
phase of the matter.
The trial of the case has already begun
in the local papers, which always take
I Fides upon all political matters. The En
quirer, which is the political organ of Mr.
Dalton, bristled with charges of all kinds,
editorially and locally. The action of the
Grand Jury is denounced as a political
move intended to injure Mr. Dalton's can
didacy lor Congress, and everybody from
Judge Greone to the Grand Jury is given
a taste of its t; y.
The Tribune, which is generally pro-
Metcalf, devotes its columns to a lot of
statements and Interviews with parties
interested, while denying the Interest of
Congressman Metcalf In the indictment.
Appeal to Laboring Men.
Mr. Dalton was around early In the day
and with his characteristic energy did
not allow any grass to grow In the neigh
borhood where he happened to be. A
flier was circulated calling a mass meet-
Ing of workingmen in California Hall on
Saturday evening, signed "The Commit
tee." and containing the following state
ment as to the object of the meeting:
The pnrroso of this meeting la to protest
asralnst the arrest of Henry P. Dalton, the
friÂ«?n.l of every laboring man and woman In
Oakland and elwÂ»w*iÂ«Â»rÂ«.
â¢ B<^at)PÂ» he is the frtfnd of those who toll:
because of his popularity among wage earners;
becaufe of the probability of a majority of
workingmen voting for him as a candidate for
Conjrrpss. his political enemies are trying to
; destroy his good standing: among laboring
people.
This whole conspiracy will be thoroughly
aired at our. mass meetln? Saturday night. By
ord-r of THE COMMITTEE.
The personal charges made against Su
perior Judge W. E. Greene and the mem
bers of the Grand Jury as political tools
! has forced the accused to make state
ments In their defense, and so to-day be
: came a day of statements. The grand
'Â¦ Jurors were telling: why they brought the
: indictment and the impeachment proceed
; ings, and Mr. Dalton and his friends were
telling what they thought about those
who brought the actions.
Verbal broadsides were being discharged
by tho opposing batteries all day. But
the battle has only Just begun to rage,
and when It concludes the battlefield will
be strewn with the political dead and
wounded. It Is too early in the battle to
predict the advantage that will result to
either side or who will bo carried to
some political St. Helena.
Ground for the Indictment.
The idea has gone abroad that the in
dictment against Mr. Dalton was brought
for the destruction of the field memo
randa used In making up the assessment
rolls. Though this was discussed by the
Grand Jury, the charge does not rest upon
this. Several members of the Grand Jury
have said to-day that In Justice to them
selves they must explain that the indict
ment was based upon the destruction of a
book In the Aessessor's office that is made
up from these field memorandum books and
not for the destruction of the smaller
books themselves. The accusation for re
moval from office was for failing to enter
upon the assessment roll, which is turned
over to the Board" of Supervisors, the
names of the owners of personal property
who had not paid taxes.
Many Inquisitors Were Friends of
Dalton but Followed the Law*.
Members of the Grand Jury that re
turned an Indictment against Assessor
Da'.ton. together with an accusation de
manding his removal from office, are
confident that when all the facts are con
sidered they will be promptly absolved by
the public of having been animated by
any personal or political animosity
toward Mr. Dalton. In fact, those | who
consent to talk of the matter are men
who have been long warm personal and
political frienls of the accused official.
They discuss the wild accusations made
against them dispassionately, but with
a sense of conviction that thev acted only
as honorable men would act. Following
are the expressions of a few:
T. L. BARKER, foremanâ The Indict
ment of Mr. Dalton was based upon the
destruction of a bound book and not upon
the destruction of any memoranda or
notes that may have been used in the
Assessor's office. The testimony was such
that not a man on the Grand Jury could
have done other than return an indict
ment or be guilty of violating his outh.
Bo fa/ as any politics Is concerned I can
only say that I can point to the names
of the grand jurors and leave with the
people of Alameda County the decision
whether these men. many of them per
sonal and political friends of Mr. Dalton,
would allow politics to influence them on
such a matter as this. Is it possible any
man would think I would do politics by
having Mr. Dalton indicted when, if from
that motive, an indictment were present
ed U would tend to give him a nomina
tion if anything could do it? It is not
within reason that I should take such a
step. The statement that I had personal
motives, because of my defeat for Mayor
and Dr. Pardee's opposition to me then, is
nonsense. That deserves absolutely no
consideration at my hands. It is not sup
nosable that I could have influenced these
members of the Grand Jury to act as they
did Each man was moved by the evi
dence and his owrf conscience."
A L.. FISH-Mr. T. LÂ£ Barker. ! the
foreman of our body, said last night that
a gentleman on the Grand Jury had told
him that he regretted and would regret
all his life that he had served on this
Grand Jury and that, though a friend of
Mr Dalton. he was compelled to take the
action he did. I am free to say that I
am the man to whom he referred. I shall
alwavs regret that I served on that Grand
Jury yet I could not have done my duty
as a'grand juror and a citizen and have
done otherwise than I did. I have al
ways voted and worked for Mr. Dalton
and for Mr. Hilborn, so that disposes of
the political side of it. I did my duty
against my wishes. ' ,
It is now only fair that the real cause of
this indictment should be told. Mr. Dal
ton was not Indicted for the destruction
of the field memorandum books. He was
indicted for the destruction of a book
known as the "office book." This hook
Is made up from the field books and con
tains the names of all personal property
owners. When Mr. Dalton was called
upon to produce that book he could not
do so and admitted that It was destroyed.
It then became our duty, to see whether
that was a record of the county and we
decided that it was. Mr. Dalton has not
obeyed the law and he knows it.
There Is one other thing that it is only
Just to say. Judge Greene never advised
us upon any point at any time ' and- all
charges against him are false; We did
call Judge Greene into consultation with
us several times and he always read the
law to us and never gave us advice of any
kind. He told us repeatedly > that â¢ we
were the ones to reach the decisions and
that he would only read us the law
I do not approve of the effort that 1Â« be
ing made to cloud the real Issue with poli
tics. The last Grand Jury made a recom
mendation that Mr. Dalton be compelled
to keep a complete record of the personal
property-owners and he should have
heeded that.
GEORGE BURBECK-I do not want to
have my character assailed when I have
only done my duty. I have always been
the friond of Mr. Dalton and these
charges of political bias are unfair We
were unanimous upon that point which
shows that charges of doing politics are
not true A cry of "politics" will net
stand against absolute facts and we found
the Indictments upon the facts and the
law.
Mr. Daiton tried to speak to me while
I was serving as a grand juror. I told
him that if he had anything to say
he must say It to the Grand Jury when it
was in session. The charge Is that a
record of Alameda County was destroyed
in order to shield Mr. Dalton from the
penalty. of not collecting personal prop
erty taxes. In our opinion the book de
stroyed was a record of the count}* and
it was not merely the little memorandum
slips, but the "office book," so-called
The charge that Judge Greene instructed
the jury is untrue.
ANDREW J. NORâ I am N a personal
friend of Mr. Dalton. but I could not let
that stand in the way of my duty. There
was absolutely no politics in the move
Some people are criticizing the Grand
Jury and trying to smirch it when they
do not know upon what the Grand Jury
voted. "We know what evidence was be
fore us and we should be given the credit
of ordinary honesty.
SAMUEL HEYWOOD-This charge of
politics is only made to cloud the real
i.~=ue. There was nothing personal In our
action and wo acted as the law directed
These attacks upon Judge Greene are un
warranted. He was consulted Just as
everj- Grand Jury has consulted other
Judges, and he gave us the law and that
was all. These attacks upon the Grand
Jury and Judge Greene are unwarranted
?,%. P - P OAG - U , , ls not a question of
politics, but one of law. Go and read the
law and see if Mr. Dalton did not violate
it. The charges of personal and political
feeling are only made at this time In or
and all those who criticize the action of
the Grand Jury to trw? law. The law is
very plain and speaks for Itself. I am not
a politician and have been a friend of Mr.
Dalton and so cannot be charged with
political bias. I have done my duty and
my honor will not suffer thereby.
SPEAKS FOR VICTOR H. METCALF
George W. Reed Declares Dalton'a
Charge of Political Job
Unwarranted.
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton has
charged that Victor H. Metcalf, his op
ponent for Congressional nomination, was
one of those who instigated the indict
ment and Impeachment proceedings. Mr.
Metcalf Is now In Washington and could
not be seen to secure a reply, but George
W. Reed, one of his campaign managers,
made the following statement:
"It is unfair to Congressman Metcalf
to charge him with any interest in this
Indictment. Mr. Metcalf has been in
Washington attending to his duties as a
Congressman, even though he has but
recently suffered a great personal loss in
his family. It is untrue that Mr. Met
calf had anything to Oo with this Indict
ment, or that he knew of it. or that he
had Â«ny interest in It- I can also say
for Mr. Metcalf s managers and friends
out here that they had nothing to do with
it. Neither Mr. Metcalf nor his campaign
committee nor his friends are making this
kind of a campaign. Such a move for
political purposes would not be counte
nanced for a moment, and the charge that
we had anything to do with It is unjust
"I know that if It had heen In the power
of Mr. Metcalf to ha%*e prevented the in
dictment of Mr. Dalton he would
have done so. This cry of politics is only
made to offset any effect that the indict
ment might have. It is also a very se
rious charge against the members of the
Grand Jury. It Is unfair to Impugn off
hand, the action of such a body of' men
as one purely of politics. That Grand
Jury was drawn by our four Superior
Judges, and it is a representative body
of men, and it is a very serious state
ment to make that four Superior Judges
and nineteen men of good reputation were
in a political scheme. To make such a
charge would Involve not only the Jury
but the Judges.
"It is also very evident that Mr Dalton
had many friends on that Jury. Mr. Met
calf would rather be defeated for Con
gress than to lose the esteem of the voters
of this county, and he certainly wou'd
not stoop to any such move as has been
charged. Neither Mr. Metcalf nor his
friends did anything to bring, about the
indictment or the Investigation. If these
charges continue to be made it can only
be with the intention of Injuring Mr. Met
calf without cause and with falsehood."
MOBE CHABGES OF POLITICS.
Mr. Dalton's Organ Says That the
Grand Jury Was "Bamboozled."
The Enquirer, which Is Mr. Dalton's or
pan. prints the following editorial, which
can be taken as an official utterance for
Mr. Dalton:
Members of the" late Grand Jury have pro
tested that they were not doing poliqcs, and it
is entirely probable that a majority of the
members were innocent of political Intentions,
but the trouble with such members Is that
they were quite too Innocent altogether They
were so Innocent that they did not know when
they were belnjf bamboozled and used by de
signing politicians. Here Id the state of the
case: Assessor Dalton did last year only what
his predecessors did and what he did during
the four previous years. No one proposed the
indictment of his predecessors; no one proposed
to indict Mr. Dalton till he became a candidate
for Congress. When he did that his enemies
vowed to destroy him. They cast about for
means to accomplish their ends and discovered
a lesral technicalityâ a technicality to which
no attention had been paid before because no
one had had a scheme of political revenee to
carry out. But for political conspirators a straw
will suffice, and In lack of any meritorious
charge asalnet Dalton It was determined to
use this foolish accusation. A majority of the
Jurors were deceived by being made to believe
It was Important and were led Into a pitfall
from which, doubtless, they, do now, or soon
will wish they had kept clear. It was not
the desire of a majority of the Jurors to be
used to pull politicians chestnuts from the
fire, but that does not alter the fact that they
were so used.
The ex-Mayor Stands by His Friend
PARDEE ON DAXTON.
and Charges Politics.
Dr. George C. Pardee. the personal
friend of Mr. Dalton. to-day made a state
ment upon the indictment. This state
ment is so direct that it sets at rest the
silly story that he and Mr. Dalton had
quarreled over politics. It reads:
The indictment of Henry Dalton by the Grand
Jury should andVill meet with the disapproval
of all honest and .Independent men. That the
Grand Jury has tjieen used In an attempt to kill
Dalton off ag a candidate for Congress Is beyond
question. But I do not. believe, that the people

"I have used coflce many years; in
fact, ever since I was a child, until a
few months ago I became satisfied that
it hurt me â caused the miserable
drow'y feeling and the bloated condi-
tion of my body. I was very fleshy all

"Since I left off drinking coffee and
use Postum Food Coffee, the effect has
been wonderful. I feel Hke a different
person. The bloating has all gone. I
am very much thinner and more natural
in shape, have a better appetite and do
not feel sleepy a^nd drowsy as before. I
shall never use any more regular coffee.
"When I first tried Postum I was not
satisfied with it, but decided that the
fault must be my own. for so many peo-
ple used Postum and liked it that I
knew there was some trouble in my
preparation of it. so I examined the di-
rections carefully and found that I
should boil it long enough to brins
out the flavor and the food value. When
I prepared it right it was elegant an d I ;

bags, against 133,671 during the same time last
year. The sales from first hands were 69.536
bags, against 75,579. The stock In first hands
June 1 was 63,143 bags, against 5S.546. The
world's visible supply June 1 was 6.056.41S bags,
against 6.144.418. The circular says: "Steadily
rising prices for soot Brazil Coffee in the New
York market have latterly been the Interesting
feature, due to long continued small receipts at
the principal points of exportation and oificlrU
announcement of bubonic plague at both ltio
and Santos. The scanty receipts there are dua
to the delay In harvesting the new crop occa
sioned by continuous rains, which are also bald
to have caused the loss of fully a tenth of the
product in Santos. Recent estimates place the
coming crops at 2.000.COO Rio, 6,500,000 Santos, or
say about 1,000.000 bags below the figures cur
rent earlier in the season. So far as mild Cof
fees are concerned here the effect of this im
provement In Brazils has been followed mainly
by those classes which were worth 10c or less;
in these an actual improvement is noticeable,
with decidedly larser business. The hifther
priced descriptions sympathized mainly in
sentiment, but have scarcely followed the ad
vance In price nor noticeably by improved de
mand. For such changes as are warranted we
call attention to the subjoined quotations.

been nearly a year without a command and
was somewhat despondent in consequence.
Coming when he had Just completed his
first voyage as master of a fine iron bark,
when his salary had just been raised,
when his wife was recovering from two
serious operations for appendicitisâ in
fact just when all his troubles seemed
over the news that he had taken his own
life constituted a mystery that no one
on the front could fathom.
Thursday morning Captain Morehouse
was laughing and joking with Captains
Perriman, Ersklne and McCulloch. At
that time he did not seem to have a care
in the world. Yesterday morning when
he left home he was in the same cheer
ful frame of mind, yet an hour' and a
half later he had died by his own hand.
Captain Morehouse's first command was
the old brig North Star. He made a
number of trips in her and then took com
mand of one of Nick BIchard's ships. Af
ter a few voyages to South and Central
America he was given command of the
clipper ship Dashing Wave. He was in
her for years and made some of the best
records on the coast while in command
of that vessel.
After sailing the Dashing "Wave for
many years Captain Morehouse decided
to go in for steamboating. He was made
chief officer of the City of Puebla by the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company and
later was transferred to the Corona. Fi
nally he came to the conclusion that he
was not cut out for a steamboat man so
he resigned from the,Corona. A year later
he was made master of the bark Diamond
Head. He arrived from Honolulu with
her on May 31 and after being released
by the quarantine officer she was taken
to Oakland to discharge her cargo of
sugar.

DAVIE MENTIONED FOR
CONGRESSIONAL HONORS
The prospects of an early break-up of
the Ice in Bering Straits are not good and
the chances are that from fifteen to twen
ty thousand gold hunters are now aboard
ships in Dutch Harbor and UnalasRa
awaiting an opportunity to reach Nome.
Advices from Unalaska dated May 17
state that there -was an unbroken barrier
of Ice clear across to the Siberian coast
and that navigation was Impossible. The
British steamer Alpha reached as far
north as latitude Cl degrees 30 minutes
and then had to put back to Dutch H*ar-'
bor. The passengers were almost In a
state of mutiny, and In order to keep
them quiet the Captain had to start out
again on May 9 in search of a passage
to the goldfields.
On May 11 the steamer Portland arrived

In port. Captain Ryfkogel reports that
the vessel sprang a leak during a north

a party of young men who were eager
to reach the gold fields and make a 'for
tune. When the schooner got outside it
was blowing a gale and instead of mak
ing any headway the little craftvwas
driven back and finally her crew ran her
Into Santa Cruz for shelter. There Cap

SOUTHERNERS HAVE A
HAMMER OUT FOR PHELAN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELAS. June 8.â The breach
that occurred two years ago In the State
Democratic Convention Is likely to prove
fatal to the aspirations of I James D.
Phelan. who seeks to pro as delegate at
largo to Kansas City. While the attitude
of Los Angeles and San Diego delega
tions, with 102 votes, is not fully defined,
knowing ones assert that the Southern
California delegates are a unit for Sen
ator White, and that he is not favorable
to Phelan. Should White throw his influ
ence toward Phelan. the statement is
made that the delegations from the south
land will join the Budd-Ralney-Harney
forces and -urb the Phe an ambition.
This combination is a retaliation for the
methods pursued by Phelan In throwing
Sown Judge Hughes after San Diego
helped seat the Phelan delegation.
OAKLAND, June 8.â Captain George
F. Morehouse, master of the bark
Diamond Head, committed suicide
by shooting himself in the head this
morning in his stateroom on the vessel,
which is lying at Long Wharf discharging
sugar from Honolulu.
The body was found stretched across
the bed in the room. A pistol was clutch
ed in the dead mariner's left hand, and
there was a bullet hole through his head.
The weapon must have been placed in the
captain's mouth when the shot was fired.
Deputy Coroner Quellen, who took
charge of the body, found nothing among
the dead man's effects to tell the cause of
his suicide, and the statement sent
from his residence in San Francisco did
not clear the mystery. According to the
statements of men aboard the vessel, Cap
tain Morehouse left it yesterday afternoon
to go to his home. 1344 Hyde street, to
visit his wife and daughter. He remained
there over night and returned on the first
boat from San Francisco this morning.
He went directly to the vessel and to his
stateroom. About 8 o'clock the cabin boy
went to call him for breakfast and found
the captain dead.
In the light of the Morgue deputy's fail
ure to find any cause for suicide, a sus
picion arose that tnere might have been
foul play, but this was dissipated by
Deputy Coroner Quellen's statement. lie
said:
Did Not Get Ship He Expected.
"Captain Morehouse undoubtedly -killed
himself. The pistol was gripped tlgrhtly
ln his clenched left hand. He was a left-
handed man. The bullA was fired into
his mouth. There was nothing in the
shape of letters found save one from the
captain's wife written while he was at
Honolulu and telling of her Illness. That
had no bearing upon the cause of death."
Captain Morehouse was a native of
Massachusetts. 42 years of age. He was
a son of John Morehouse of San Leandro.
Deceased was a member of Excelsior
Lodge of Masons of San Francisco.
The wife of Captain Morehouse. who be
fore her marriage was Miss Minnie Cor
bett, was so badly shocked by the news
of the death that she had to take to her
bed again. She insists that the captain
was murdered.
The mother of the deceased, now Mrs.
Lambert, lives at 316'4 Devisadero street,
San Francisco. His brother-in-law. Will
lam Corbett, is cashier of the Selby
Smelting Works.
The probable cause of Captain Mor?
house's de"ath came to light at the inquest
held here to-night. AV. C. Corbett testified
that the deceased had been troubled with
insomnia and some of the dead man's
friends said he had been greatly disap
pointed at not having received the com
mand of one of Goodall. Perkins & Co.'s
ships. He had expected this position, but
learned only yesterday that another man
had been named, they testified.
A verdict of suicide while temporarily
Insane was returned by the Coroner's
jury.
San Francisco Friends Shocked.
The suicide of Captain Morehouse was
a startling surprise to his former friends
and associates on the water front in thi3
city. Had he committed tne rash act a few
months ago they would not have been so
much" surprised as he had at that time
to secure some daring plumbers with a
courage equal to a desire for business.
Yesterday nearly twenty-five men en
tered Chinatown to erect a crematory for
the destruction of garbage. They were in
tho employ of \V. W. Montague & Co..
who hold the contract. All of them
worked during the day and passed out on
Pacific street In the evening.
Last evening the Board of Health got
another idea in regard to the electric
light men. and the order went forth that
none of them should be allowed within the
barbed wire. This was all right until the
ligfcts of Chinatown went out. and there
being no expert available to fix them the
section ran the remainder of the night
with gas, kerosene or candles.
Having closed out the electricians an
other order was issued that practically
restores all the passes the board ordered
taken up two days ago. It was announced
that every one who had been inoculated
and who had a certificate certifying to
that effect, countersigned by the Chief of
Police, could go through the lines and
come out again. This puts the quarantine
back to the point where It was when the
merchants raised such a protest on the
ground that it had leaks.
BAKERSFIELD, June S.â S. J. Quint,
acting assistant surgeon of the United
States Marine Hospital, arrived here to
day and assumed authority as sanitary
Inspector of the city and vicinity. He will
inspect all trains arriving from San Fran
cisco, Â¦whether regular or special, pri
marily for evidences of bubonic plague.
As most of the southbound trains reach
Bakersfleld during the night Dr. Quint's
duties will necessarily cause considerable
annoyance to the traveling public.
Republicans are making ready to hold a
prnr.d ratification meeting on Thursday
evening, June 21. The National Conven
tion will assemble in Philadelphia on
Tuesday, the liah lust. It is expected
that President MeKinley -will be renorn-
Inated on Wednesday, and that the can
didate for Vice President will be named
not later than Thursday afternoon. Many
expect that the ticket will be complete
\Te<lr.esday evening. To guard against
j rrmature action the Republicans have
decided to designate Thursday evening
as the time for ratification meetings
throughout CaUforr.la.
The Union League Club's committee on
political action met last night to con
eider the advisability of holding a great
meeting in this city, under the auspices
cf thÂ« club. Among the commltteemen
present were: A. G. Booth, president of
the Institution: Tirey L. Ford, chairman
cf the coEuaitteÂ«; Dan T. Cole, J. M.
Glcaves, Colonel J. C. Currier, Alden An
derson. Jacob H. Neff, George H. Pippy.
6. J. Hendy. A. S. Mangrum and Colonel
George Stone, chairman of the Republican
State Central Committee.
When the proposition was advanced to
hold ihe ratification meeting under the
auspices of the club Colonel Stone out
lined the r<!an of the State organization
and expressed the hope that the Union
League would join hands with the com
mittee of whlcn he was chairman. The
discussion called forth a statement from
A. G. Booth that the Union League had
resolved to take an active part in the
Presidential campaign â that the sentiment
cf Its members in favor of active and
earnest work in the Republican cause had
been vigorously expressed. President
Booth, however, was willing to Join
hands with the State Central Committee
to make the ratification meeting on
Thursday evening, June 21. a success. It
was then resolved that the league and
State organization should unite their
forces to make the first meeting- of the
campaign a great demonstration. In due
time speakers will be announced
The ITnion league Club yesterday de
rided to give a. public reception. to M. M.

It was considered that Judge Estee's ca

The Republican State Central Commit
tee will soon prepare a circular letter ad

tial that attention should be immediately
piven to this subject. The law requires
new registration throughout the State for
the general election next November. AsÂ»
all votrrs must register p.n^w. It is recom
mended that the duty be performed at
once, so no question can arise regarding
the right to vote at the primary election
on the second Tuesday of August.

The imjirefslon that Marion de \ rles

Appraiser has been made stronger by the
action of the Senate in declining to con
lirm the appointment of Bynum of In

to * belief in will informed politi
cal circles that the Democrats must
put forward a candidate other than
t>" Vrios for Congress in thf Second Dis
trict. It is an admitted fact that E>e
Vries was popular, her.ee there was no
ruÂ«h of Republican candidates to run
asairm him. The inside inu-Uigence that

front quite a number of Republican aspi
rants The best ported politicians incline
to the belief that Colonel K.- A- Forbes

GREAT RALLY TO
OPEN CAMPAIGN
FOR McKINLEY
The inevitable is happening and scandal
is rising out of the quarantine of China
town. It was reported at a meeting of the
Chinese Merchants.' Exchange last Sun
day that for $10,000 the quarantine would
be raised and a large amount of goods,
arrived from China and held under sus
picion and for fumigation, would be re
leased. Part of the money was raised
and word was brought back to the go-be
tween that the remainder would be forth
coming, but by that time the scheme had
fallen through and' the Chinese were told
that It was too late, that matters had
gone too far for a settlement and the
quarantine would have to stay.
The offer came the day after the second
quarantine had been put in force. It was
brought to the merchants by one of their
number, described by the Chinese Consul
as one of "the first merchants of China
town." He told the members of the ex
change that he had been approached by a
man, whom he would not name, who
made the proposition to raise the quaran
tine for a sack of good red gold. And to
make the merchants secure in anything
they might do to raise the money, It was
stipulated by the proposer that there need
be no pay until the quarantine had ac
tually been raised and the goods in de
tention on the wharf had been let go free.
Would Put TJp Blackmail.
To merchants suddenly shut out from
lucrative trade the prospect was alluring,
for it seemed to reduce to a certainty the
loss the plague scare would bring upon
them, and the Chinese have always been
keen business men, preferring a cer
tainty to a chance at all times. The prop
osition was therefore received and a list
was passed around to see what prospect
there was of raising the money. The list
showed conclusively that if the offer had
been made in what might be called "good
faith" there would be no difficulty in find
ing the money, for right there in the meet
ing $7000 was promised.
There was no effort to canvass the dis
trict or to see any one not at the meeting.
The list was simply passed around and re
turned to the president with the subscrip
tions upon It. It was evidence that the
Chinese had faith in the proposition, in
famous as it was on its face, and that
they were willing to back their belief in
the story brought to them by one of their
number with their * coin. There was no
question of the morality of the transac
tion. What the merchants wanted was to
get out of their plight and then consider
the morality, If, indeed, they had not for
gotten it by that time; and so they sub
scribed their money as good white citizens
would subscribe for a Fourth of July cele
bration or to help keep out the plague.
The action of the merchants was re
ported back to the "promoters" and the
next day, Monday, or the Tuesday fol
lowing, the answer was returned to the
merchants that it was too late to continue
negotiations and the deal would have to
be called off.
Consul Investigating.
The truth of the proceedings before the
Chinese Merchants' Exchange is vouched
for by Ho Yow, the Chinese Consul. He
does not undertake to say who the pro
poser of the scheme is, but the matter is
being investigated. It was thought at
first that some one was trying to play
the wily Chinese merchants for guileless
children of trade, but the proposition that
there should be no money paid over until
the quarantine had actually been raised
and the goods under detention had been
released lent to the scheme a semblance of
authenticity; besides the man who made
the report to the meeting was of such
standing as to carry weight enough to
balance $7000. The matter is being quietly
worked up with a view to using such in
formation as is gained in the suits now
pending before the courts. If the Consul
can verify the Information he has a nasty
scandal will be the result.
It was reported In connection with the
case that the subscription list was a
check for $6000 made'out to one of the
physicians of the Six Companies, who had
agreed to raise the quarantine, or have it
raised, for that amount, but at the time
the list was made out the Six Companies
had retained no physicians at all, nor did
they do so until two days after the offer
was made in the meeting of the Mer
chants'.. Exchange.
Loosening the Lines.
The quarantine situation Is at a stand
still, or nearly at a standstill, for there
are signs of loosening in the strict lines
that followed the second application of
ropes and barbed wire to Chinatown. The
first sign of weakness was an order al
lowing men of the Fire Department,'
chasing an alarm, to enter Chinatown
and after extinguishing the fire to re
turn without Interference. Then some
cUctric lights got the plague and it was
decided to allow a few. just .*i few, clec
trkiaans to enter the tabooed district and
â¢attend to tho elusive fluid and eet It back
upon the. wires. Then one of the water
mains burpt an'l S some men from the
Spring Valley Company were allowed to
cross the deadline with a horse and
wagon and some tools to fix the break.
And now a* (squad of plumbers, presum
ably immune, . will be allowed to scatter
themselves among the pipes of the quar
ter, fixing what they find needs fixing
and nosing around generally in the pur
suit of their craft.
Of course, all these are necessary ad
juncts to a properly quarantined district,
but the fact remains that they will be
allowed to come and go with a few min
utes in the fumlgator to purge them of all
external germs. They will not be Inocu
lated and the board cannot compel them
to be inoculated and while the fumigation
will kill the germs that may lodge In
their clothing there is nothing to prevent
some of the bacilli, should they strike
them, from entering the plumbers' sys
tems . and making themselves evident
outside the lines. No attempt has been
made to get men from the. light? com
panies, the water company or any other
of the supply corporations to take their
place inside the lines and do what work Is
necessary and no attempt has been made
joyous days of that brand of '.'dead beat" that whisks his lady
I through the park on the Sabbath behind a steed of speed and beauty,
[ and then "does? the liveryman out of his lawful charge, are over.
The Liverymen's Board of Trade., having as one of Its principal ob
jects the undoing- of this species of "doers," has. effected a permanent organ
ization, with downtown offices, and its prospectus, recently issued, sets forth
the objects thereof In detail. It reads: ..^r-
The objects of the association are to be the advancement Of the lnterents of livery
men and protection to the livery and boarding stable business of the liverymen of San
Francl3co.'
-These results are to bo attained by uniting the, liverymen of San Francisco In an
organization to be' known as the Liverymen's Beard of Trade, which shall not attempt
to classify stables or to control the price* of ; livery or Â¦ boarding. It will, however,
Immediately benefit Us members by the publication Its collection bureau of a
list of bad debtorsâ llver>' stable dead beats-^-and also*a Hat of "bad drivers" â those that
break rigs and Injure horses through reckless or careless driving. The secretary , will
also notify all members Immediately whenever any customer Is reported as having
been stopped for non-payment of his account, thus saving loss through undesirable
patronage." Â¦ â¢'- â¢'-."Â¦Â¦ .' '/..'/ .' '
; It Is also' the Intention to have the'attorney for the organization prosecute vigor
ously all 'cases ; wherein" members . receive damage to their ' rigs through ."bumping**,
by cars, and In general to look after the legal Interests of the business for. the protec
tion ot members. Also an attempt will be made to add neWjbusiness to the stables by
having coal dealers and others renting stalls or^bearding horses licensed as liverymen,
in ' addition Â¦ to their regular licenses. - ;
