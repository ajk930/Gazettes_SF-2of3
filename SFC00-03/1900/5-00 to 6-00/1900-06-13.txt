SUMMER RESIDENCE OF
BRITISH MINISTER BURNED
LOXDON', June 13.â The correspondents
at Tientsin, Shanghai and other treaty
ports throw Bide lights upon the situation.
According to one dispatch from Tientsin
it is understood there that the foreign
Ministers will insist, as . soon as fresh
bayonets arrive at Peking, upon the re
moval of the anti-foreign advisers of the
Dowager Empress and upon the substitu
tion for them of -councilors friendly to
Western civilization.
The English at Shanghai are'afraid that
Great Britain has been deceived and that
the whole business will have to be gone
through again. Russia's aims, they argue,
are net understood, and Russia and
France are apparently not working in the
same spirit a*Â« the ether powers." Five
thousand Russians are ready to land at
Taku. .. . _ - . . . .â¢-â¢â¢..
A telegram from Yokohama, dated
Tuesday evening, says .that- the Japanese
Government has ordered four more war
ships to proceed to Taku and 4003 men of
all arms are under. orders to be in imme
diate readiness for. embarkation.
T.he dispatch says the Japanese Govern
ment "trusts the powers will not miscon

The Shanghai correspondent of the

\Yu Ting Fang, Chinese Minister, declined to-day to discuss
the appeal alleged to emanate from Weng Tung No, formerly
tutor to the Chinese Emperor, for the deposition of the Empress
Dowager and the restoration of Kwang Hsu to the throne. Dip
lomats well versed in Chinese affairs would not be surprised if the
appeal were genuine. Weng Tung No, after his dismissal by the
Empress Dowager in 1898. retired to his home at Soo Chow, sev
eral hours distant from Shanghai, and as the appeal is dated
Shanghai it looks as though he may be responsible for it. That it
is issued with the sanction of the Emperor is hardly believed., in
view of the fact that Kwang Hsu is closely guarded jn the imperial
palace and communication with him is extremely difficult. It is
possible, however, that Weng Tung No is familiar with the Em
peror's aspirations and acted as he did knowing that the appeal
would be approved. It would not be surprising if the powers were
to go to the extent of removing the Empress Dowager and restor
ing the Emperor, especially in view of the fact that she is encour
aging the Boxer movement, and so long as she is in power will
not take action for its suppression. With the Emperor on the
throne, under control of the diplomatic corps, no time would be
lost in putting an end to the movement, and it is believed here no'
trouble would be experienced in suppressing the rebellious Chi
nese once they are assured that they can ' look for no assistance
from the Government.
The only encouraging message which was received here to-day came to Mr. Xabeshima, Japanese Charge d'Affaires, who was informed by. his Government
that the representatives of the powers at Peking were acting harmoniously for the protection of foreign life and property and for the reopening- of communication be
tween Peking and Tientsin. In view of the danger besetting the foreign diplomats in Peking it is expected that foreign marines will see to it that communication be-
LONDON. June 11â3:20 A. M.â According to a dispatch to the Dally Express
from Machadodorp dated June 10. via Lourenzo Marques, those around
President Krugrr say that Generals Louis Botha and Delarey hare been
' offered indirectly Â£10,000 a year to lay down their arms, and President
Kruger expects the same offer to be made to himself, President Steyn
and De "Wet. President Kruger believes that the British make these efforts to
close the war on the principle that it would cost less than to fight It out.
Two plec?s of news encouraging to the British In the official dispatches are
that the broken communications of Lord Roberts are In a fair way to be mended
by the forces moving northward and southward and driving off the roving com
mandos, and that Sir Redvers Buller la at last master of Laings Kek. Tele
graphic communication with Lord Roberts Is expected to be restored to-day, as
a dispatch from Bloemfontein. dated yesterday, says that the railway is In Brit
ish possession again and that the work of repairing the line Is going on rapidly
with abundant material warehoused at Bloemfonteln.
From the subjoined telegram it would appear that General Hunter was In
command of the troops referred to by General Kelly-Kenney. In his dispatch from
Eloemfontein June 12: "General Hunter is coming up rapidly from the north
west, having severely defeated a large cemmand of Boers who had destroyed
two miles of railway north of Kroonstad."
Th*Â». Boer government Is also Issuing news cheering to Its sympathizers. Tha
following bulletin, the Boer version of the disaster to the Derbyshlres. was posted
by President Kruger at Machadodorp:
"On June 7 four divisions of burghers, commanded by Steenkammp. Frlne
man. Duploy. Fourie and'Hel, attacked the British at Roodeval. killed 200, took
700 prisoners and captured immense stores of food and ammunitionâ a Maxim gun
and 1C00 lyddite shells. Some food was taken by the Boer farmers and the rest
was burned. The English 'mail was taken. The burghers attacked from the open
veMt and gave evidence of unprecedented bravery."
General de Wet was also fighting on June 2. whether at Roodeval or elsewhere
is not clear, but the Boer War Office gives It out that he captured 3000 suits of
clothing, blankets, gloves, boots, etc. Being unable to take them with him In his
rapid advance through the country, according to the Transvaal War Office, he
burned the whole mass. General de Wet has also reported that he put 1000 Brit
ish out of action and destroyed property valued at Â£100,000. As Lord Methuen
Is officially described as fighting on June 7 it Is possible that he was engaged by
General de- Wet.
A dispatch from Lourenzo Marqtxes say3 that 1500 Boers are reported to be
retiring on Middleburg from various quarters and that, after weeding out the
faint-hearted. 20,000 men are still left.
.... . General ' Buller was unable on Monday to follow up the Boers from lack of
cavalry' as well as water. The dispatches describe him as fighting: a spirited ad
vance over a rugged field under prolonged rifle fire. The Boers had two guns,
which they got away. Few dead or wounded Boers were found. It seems
probable. that the major portion of the Boers had withdrawn before the ad
vance, beian._

SIR ALFRED^ MILNER. GOVERNOR OF CAPE COLONY. AND Hit
' ' COMMISSIONER FOR SOUTH AFRICA.
CROWN COLONY GOVERNMENT
PLANNED FOR SOUTH AFRICA
LONDON. June 12.â It Is learned by the Associated Press that the Gov
ernment has at last decided upon a pjan for the civil settlement of
South Africa. The details are kept most secret, but It can safely be
said that the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal will become
crown colonies. Sir Alfred Milner. It is declared. Is to be High Com
missioner of South Africa, in spite, of the opposition he has incurred. The
crown colony form of government can be best understood by reference to the
system in vogue in the West .Indies, Sierra Leone and Ceylon. Endeavors will
be. made to put this in force as soor. as possible In the Transvaal and Or
ange River colonies, though It ?s scarcely expected that the details will
be announced or some parts of the work be begun for a few months. "While
the civil settlement will .be drawn up so as to be eventually Independent of
military enforcement. It is realized that the initial -work must be done with
the co-operation of the troops. Sir Alfred Milner appears to believe that civil
reorganization and military pacification can proceed simultaneously, and that a
possible scattered rising: will^not seriously retard the progress of reorgan
ization once it is begun. The Colonial Office Is said to be of the opinion,
however, that the maintenance of good-sized garrisons at such centers as
Bloernfontein. Kroonstad. Johannesburg and Pretoria will be necessary for a
long time after the crown colony system gets In -working order. For this
reason and others put forward by Sir Alfred Milner, the idea of granting an
autonomous ftrm of government has been abandoned. It is believed,
though it cannot be verified, that a portion of the Transvaal will be parti
tioned off to Natal.
The whole arrangement may be roughly described as coinciding with the
views .advanced by the progressives, as opposed to those held by bundltea.
The final Fteps in this direction have been taken during the last few days.
Mr. Cbambrrlatn sent for J. P. Fltzpatrick. author of "The Transvaal From
Within." who is well known In connection with South African affairs, and
spent n whole day In consultation with hJm. Mr. Fitzpatrlck will sail for
Cape Town June IS to join the advisory committee which Sir Alfred Milner
Is forming.

PEKING, June 12. â Boxers have murdered one of the secretaries of the Japanese Legation here. The remainder of the foreign residents are besieged in Legation
street. Nothing has been heard of the relief force which we are advised left Tientsin three days since. Wires running south from Peking have been cut, but the
Russian line is still working. .
LONDON, June 13, 5:20 a. m. â The Times, in an extra edition, publishes the following dispatch from Peking, dated June 12, 2 p. m.: "The Chancellor of
the Japanese Legation. Sugyiama Akira, while proceeding alone and unprotected on official duty, was brutally murdered by soldiers of Tung Fuh Siang, the favorite
body-guard of the Empress Dowager, at Manigate railroad station yesterday. Reinforcements are daily expected. The present isolated" position at Peking, the destruc
tion of foreign property in the country and the insecurity of life are directly attributable to treachery of the Chinese Government."
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 12.â Fears are expressed in diplomatic circles here. to-night that the mur
der of the Tapanese secretary of the legation and the besieging of foreign residents in Legation street, Peking, will furnish a spark which will cause the spread of the
internal conflagration in China to the powers. Secretary Hay told me that he had not been advised of the death of the Japanese diplomat and of the imminent danger
in which foreigners in Peking seem to be. Mr. Nabeshima, secretary of the Japanese Legation, also stated that he .was without advices, but expressed confidence that
upon confirmation of the report his Government would take prompt measures for the protection of its subjects and their interests in the celestial kingdom.
The murder of the Japanese secretary of the legation, in the opinion of administration circles, increases the danger of murder of American missionaries. The
grave danger in which these missionaries are placed was considered during a meeting of the Cabinet to-day and a serious discussion took place, with a view of de
termining upon some means to furnish them efficient protection. A member of the Cabinet, after leaving the White, House, said that the truth. of the matter is that
the President does not fully comprehend the situation because of a lack of information; that messages so far received are very indefinite, and that before a final pol
icy can be determined upon fuller advices are necessary. There is no doubt that during the Cabinet session there was talk of using troops, but this same official de
clared that the President does not care to dispatch soldiers into China, preferring, so long as other powers make no such move, to leave operations to detachments
from the naval squadrons at Taku. But the murder of a Japanese diplomat and the dangerous situation of foreign .residents of Peking,- added to the conceded proba
bility that Japan will now send troops to China, may cause a rapid change of view. with respect to the use of American soldiers. Japan is in no mood { to permit her
official representative in Peking to be murdered, especially by persons engaged in a movement encouraged by the ruler of the Chinese empire. The Empress Dow
ager is jealous of Japan, and Russia will probably either object to the dispatch of Japanese troops into China or else send herself a large, force into the territory in
cluded in her sphere of influence and perhaps to Peking itself. The result is difficult to foresee unless an agreement of some kind should be reached beforehand.
The imperative need of vigorous action is shown by the dispatches received by the State Department from several points in China, only one of which was
made public. The appeal for a warship has not been answered, but it is believed it will be, and Consul Martin is expected to continue to wire developments to Secre
tary Hay. The American Consul at Chefoo has reported a very dangerous situation there, and it was rumored to-day that he stated that the Boxers were attacking,
missionaries near his consulate. This report could not be confirmed.

The engineers of the Empress of Japan
were not s-'atisiled with the result, how
ever, and they challengedthe crew of the
China to race them to Nagasaki. The
challenge was taken up and the firemen

and in consequence the China averaged
fceve'nteen knots throughout the trip and
won easily. In fact, the Empress of Ja

ANOTHER ARREST IN
THE CONSPIRACY CASE
FEW vessels hav^. had more narrow
escapes in as short a space of time
as the United States transport
Grant. The last round trip to the
Philippines has been a succession of nar
row escapes, and it is only due to the
vigilance of the officers that the transport
finally reached port.
Soon after leaving San Francisco one
of her Inlet valves became clogged and
the water rushing in filled the engine
room until the fires under the lower boiler
were drowned cut and the engineers and
firemen were working up to their waists
In water.
While the run to San Francisco was
under way the man on the lookout ran
up against a mirage. He thought land
was straight ahead and so reported It to
the bridge. The officer on watch saw an
outline looming up and as It was appar
ently capped by a light he gave the signal
to stop the ship and sent for the captain.
The Grant was in the vicinity of Reed
Rocks, the position of which is doubtful,
their place on the chart of the globe being
followed by a ouery mark. When, there
fore, the fog bank took on the appear
ance of the Farallone Islands and the
morning star showed up like a beacon on
its peak, the lookout thought the land was
dead ahead, so the engines were stopped
and reversed and the ship was going. full
speed astern when Captain Buford reach
ed the bridge. It did not take long to
discover the mistake and in half an hour
the Grant was once more on her course.
Reed Rocks have not been seen since
1SGS, when the ship Yankee nearly ran
them down. They have always been
classed as "doubtful," and the chances
are that the old Yankee skipper was
fooled by the morning star and a cloud,
as was the lookout on the Grant.
From Honolulu to Manila and from
there to Nagasaki the voyage of the
Grant was uneventful. The run from
Nagasaki to San Francisco made up for
the monotony, however. When about nve
days from San Francisco lire broke out in
the engine-room. Escaping ammonia was
ignited by a spark from the pipe of a
careless engineer, and in a few moments
the engine-room was In a blaze. A nre
alarm was turned in. and about three
minutes later Chief Officer Crosky had
three streams of water playing on tho
flames and every man on the transport
was at his place." It was a close call and

DISASTER TO
RELIEF COLUMN
ON THE PRAH
General Opinion Is That the Present
Force Is Utterly Inadequate
to Cope With the Situ
ation.
Men Under Carter and Wil
kinson Meet With a
Serious Reverse.
ACCRA. Gold Coast. June 12.â Details
have been received here of another seri
ous reverse to the relief column under
Colonel Carter and Major Wilkinson a
day's march north of the Prah.
There were heavy casualties. The latest
rumors report a further disaster to a de
tachment on the nonh bank of the Prah,
â¢which Is now flooded, and where the
Ashantis were found strongly intrenched.
Colonel WiMcock'p advance has been de
layed by rains, which have destroyed the
bridges on the Prahsu road. The con
tinued absence of news from Kumassie
tends to ccntirm the pessimistic views as
to the safety of the Governor and his
Ftaff. The coast towns are apprehensive
of their own safety.
The Hrit!sh gunboat Magpie, stationed
at Accra, is the sole protection for thÂ»
coast. Owing to the difficulty encountered
In procuring carriers the enforcement of
a labor ordinance Is thr^a toned, but such
a step is considered inadvisable In view of
the present temper of the inhabitants and
the unprotected condition of thf colony.
The general opinion is that the -'present
force is Inadequate to eopp with the situa
tion and the local government apparently
fails to recognize its gravity.

was too heavily loaded. A strong wind
caught the cratt at R5k Windy, and the
cattle becoming excited overturned the
craft in which they had been loaded. This
was attached by ropes to the big scow in
which the party was living and caused
it to careen, shipping a quantity of water

SAN RAFAEL, June 12.â SHnkey's nl
lfged poolroom was opened this morning
at Frank Payne's tamale cafe In Sausa
llto. The place gives promise of being a
first-class poolroom," though' a technicality
may rob It of its real character. The
place is alleged to be run by Frank Payne
and Dan Bllnkey, but the proprietors of
most of . the ventures of that character
are difficult to find. 'Heretofore women
have found Httle convenience In. the town
as far as betting went. ;The tamale cafe
now cpens the way for the: lady plungers,
who may discard the tout and go-between.
It is generally understood that the pool
men are responsible for the - new place
an<l that it Is run under their supervision.
This morning when the place was opened
some forty, women of all ages and classes
were on hand and ' made business brisk
with their many bets. The opponents of
the - gamblers . are indignant t at this new
move and promise to continue the battle
against them. MM WPM

latter is a veteran at polo, having been
used by Walter Hobart, who Â¦ plays a des

he went on the field. The ponies were not
sold as a business venture, it being doubt
ful if any one but a personal friend of the
players could secure them at any price.

More State Aid.
President Wheeler presented a re
port of the committee of the Coun
cil . of the Associated Alumni in re
gard to a plan for improving the finan
cial condition of the university by secur
ing more liberal State aid through a tax
on Incorporations and a small inheritance
tax. This report was signed by George
Edwards, Gaston E. Bacon, L. de F.
Bartlett, William E. Ritter and Charles
W. Slack. At the conclusion of the read
ing of the report. Regent Foster asked
that a copy of the report be -sent to each
Regent as it was a matter of,. Importance
and should be studied before action was
taken. Regent Houghton thought the
plan ought to be brought to the public's
attention at once so that It Would appre
ciate the needs of the university. State
Superintendent of Instruction Kirk said
he concurred heartily with what Regent
Poster said and thought the matter should
be turned over to a committee to examine
the plan and report at a future meeting.
A motion was made that a committee of
three be appointed and Chairman Wallace
named Regents Foster, Slack and John E.
Budd.
After a large number of bills had been
rfad and ordered paid the budget was
taKen up. v RegenÂ» Reinsteln was of the
opinion that care should be taken in pass-
Ine upon the financial statement and he
asked President Wheelpr what his views
were In the matter. The latter refrained
from answering, as he saw that he could
not stay its postponement. He did say
that he was, goinK Kast to-night on.busi
ness for the university and -would be gone
a month. Mr. Reinsteln, therefore, made
a motion that the consideration of the
budget be postponed until a special meet
ing to be held on July 24. The motion pre
vailed. Regent Budd gave notice that he
would strike out a number of Items In the
budget.
' The building committee asked for $4000
to furnish .the chemical laboratory with
sinks, gas, water fixtures, furniture, fur
naces and chemical apparatus, but' action
was deferred until the next meeting. Pro
fessor Edmund O'Neill will' be called up
on to Itemize the statement he submitted
to the buildings committee.
; Jtidpe 'Wallace, havins: in mind the dan
ger of destruction by fire of the valuable
art treasures that fill the rooms of the
Art Institute, offered a resolution to the
effect that the committee on buildings
and grounds be requested to communicate
with Chief Sullivan and ask that nfflr'al
to make a thorough Inspection of the
building with a view to suggesting the
best means of protecting the place from
fire. Tho resolution was unanlmously

REAR ADMIRAL SCHLEY
IS NOT A CANDIDATE
PHILADELPHIA. June 12.â The TIme3
to-morrow will say editorially: "The
name.'of :Rear Admiral Schley has been
repeatedly suggested as on the Hat from
which the Democrats would be likely to
choose their candidate for President or
Vice President, but all who. know the
views of Rear Admiral Schley' uniformly
that such .use ' of ' his name was
not only unwarranted but against his own
distinctly .expressed wishes and purposes.
'He was specially careful before going to
sea - in â¢ command of the South Atlantic
squadron, to declare to his friends -that
under no circumstances would he consent
to become a political candidate.

those repeated and emphatic declarations
of Rear Admiral Schley, he has been fre-
led some to believe that there may be

M'LEAN MEN CONTROL %
PRELIMINARY MEETINGS
COLUMBUS, June 12.â The McLean men
controlled tho preliminary meetings to
day, but they are evidently playing for
harmony more than for places^ and may
not carry out the same programme in the
Democratic State Convention to-morrow.

of the Hon. William A. Clark. Senator of the

come to tho front at the National Com
mittee meeting to-morrow. The resolu
tion of Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin,
presented at last winter's meeting ami
which was withdrawn before it was put
to a vote, will again be pressed, but not
by Its author. The strongest supporters
of the Payne measure come from New
England. Colonel Charles K. Brayton,
national commlttecman from Rhode Isl
and, who is also chairman of the Khode
Island delegation, will make a strong ef
fort to have the representation changed.
Henry E. Tiepke, Commissioner of In
dustrial Statistics of Rhoac Island, who
will be Colonel Brayton's proxy in to
morrow's meeting, said to-night ne would
endeavor to carry out the colonel's
wishes. Committeeman Bray tor., he said,
has been in communication with the na
tions! committeemen of all the States and
his replies include more than twenty who
favor the Payne resolution. This resolu
lution provides for four dclegates-at
l&rge. for each State and an additional del
egate for every 10,000 Republican votes
1 or majority fraction thereof, based on the
returns of the last Presidential election.
The meeting of the National Committee
will be devoted largely to the hearing of
contests from the various States. It Is
not believed that the committee will fin
ish this part of its work in one day.
The sub-committee of the National Com
mittee held another meeting to-day be
hind closed doors. According to Chair
man Manley nothing but routine business
was considered.
The convention hall will be formally
transferred to the National Committee to-,
morrow afternoon, although the sergeant
at arms will not assume control of the
hall until Saturday or probably Monday
morning. Invitations have been extended
by the citizens' convention committee to
Senator Hanna, the members of the Na
tioal Committee and a number of invited
guests to inspect the hall. Speeches will
be made by Mayor Ashbridge and several
others of the visitors.
President McKinley's picture is begin
ning to appear on every hand, although
the actual nomination is seldom men
tioned by the throngs. The Vice Presi
dential gossip, however, has taken a wide
range. The name? of many prominent
men throughout the country are men
tioned as possibilities. So far there has
been no Concentration of forces here of
any one man, and there probablv will not
be until the National Committee gets to
pother.
DEMAND A SOUTHERN
MAN FOR CHAIRMAN
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 12.â Two promi
nent features are uppermost in the minds
cf the Democratic delegates who to-day
started for the Sacramento convention.
One faction declares that If the north
erners have any man booked for chair
man other than former Senator White
he must be pulled down. On this the
delegations seem insistent. Another fac
tion als>o is as vehement in its demands
that Martin C. Marsh of Los Angeles
shall pound the gavel. One fact is ap
parentâthat the delegates from the south
are united and that no wing or faction
can win without their support. It is a
foregone conclusion that Stephen White
will go as delegate at large. Ex-Governor
Budd in the past few days has developed
unusual strength, which causes the stock
of Phelan to be held at a low figure.
Opposition to Phelan arises from the con
test of two years ago, when the "Moss
back" element, then in control here, sup
ported Phelan. The situation is now re
versed and the San Francisco Mayor Â¦will
find a big knife that will cut very close
to the top among his San Francisco ad
herents. As free transportation is not
lacking those who intend to give proxies
have decided to go to enjoy the scramble
that is sure to follow the gathering.

left the city for Philadelphia at 10
a. m. yesterday. Two Pullman
sleepers of the regular passenger train
were reserved for tho delegates, alternates
and convention visitors from California,
There was no special demonstration in
honor of the departure of the delegation,
owing perhaps to the fact that seven of
the delegation, among them three repre
sentatives at large, had gone East in ad-
VÂ«jice of the main body.
Among the Republicans who crossed the
bay on tho 10 o'clock boat to give the dele
gallon a "send off" at the Oakland mole
were Lieutenant Governor Neff, William
Hamilton, William Reynolds, Dan T. Cole,
D. :.L Bums, Edward Conroy and Jacob
Sterpacher.
The reserved Pullmans were forward of
the regular sleepers, and by the time the
delegates found where they belonged the
conductor was shouting "All aboard.",
The bearer of the silken banner had to
r.urry up to get tho standard aboard. A
Btreamer running- lengthwise of the first
car bore the inscription. "California Dele
gation to National Republican Convention,
lwi." A picture of President McKinley
â¢was displayed on a. shield^of the streamer.
The inscription on the second car was:
"West Greets East; North Greets South.
Union, Prosperity, McKinley. Golden
California to Iron Pennsylvania. Indus
try Makes Wealth."
When the train pulled out Dan T. Cole
lifted his hat and proposed three cheers
for tho Republican delegation. The cheers
were given and the departing delegates
isiimaled approval.

Jacob Steppacher accompanied tho

arrangements that seemed most satisfac

A large crowd was at the depot at Sac

however, permit him to keep the prize,

Indications That New
State Central Com
mittee Will Not
Be Chosen*
There Is a. sentiment among leading
Democrats In favor of deferring the selec
tion of a State Central Committee until
the nominating convention assembles.
No question of law to perplex the
party can be raised If this plan la fol
lowed.
It was reported yesterday In Democratic
circles that Daniel Ostrom of Tuba had
signified a readiness to withdraw from the
field as a candidate for delegate at large
In favor of M. K. Tarpey. It is the opin
ion of Interior delegates that W. II. Al
ford, who is popular in the country, was
too slow In making up his mind to becomo
a candidate for delegate at large. If he
had announced his candidacy several
weeks ago delegates who were then un
pledged would have promised him sup
port, but now they are half way com
mitted to support the slate ticket contain
ing the names of "White. Magulre, Phelan
and Tarpey. If Alford determines to fight
to the finish he may break the combina
tion, but a hard tight will be required.
There will be a great many proxies In
the convention, yet it is calculated that
two-thirds of the chosen delegates will
attend.
The party leaders are counting: on an
attendance of GOO delegates.
R. F. del Valle and Burke of Los An
geles. Ostrom of Yuba, Charles Edelman
and Jasper McDonald of San Francisco.
R. M. Fitzgerald of Alameda. John J. Mc-
Oonigle of Ventura. J. H. Henry of San
Jose and C. N. Wood of Stockton are
spoken of as district delegates to the
Kansas City convention.
A. W. Kepoykal. C. B. Wilson and Sam
uel Parker, delegates from Hawaii to tho
Republican National Convention, arrived
yesterday from Honolulu on the steamer
China. They regretted the departure of
the California delegates before the arrival
of the steamer.
Colonel E. A. Forbes of Marysvllle la
In the city. His friends assert that he
â¢will be nominated and elected to Congress
to succeed Marlon de Vries.
The opinion is expressed that the Re
publican State Convention committed an
error In this respect, and that by reason
of the error the right of the new Repub
lican State Committee to file petitions as
the governing body of the party may bÂ«
challenged.
Lawyers cite section 11S6 of the Political
Code to sustain their contention. The sec
tion contains this definition:
A convention, within the meaning' of this act.
is an organized assemblage of delegates, elected
by ballot at a primary election, and represent

WHOLESALE ADVICE
For People Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poor.
Dr. Harlandson. -whose opinion In dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
man or woman comes to me complaining
of Indigestion, loss of appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour watery-rlslnsr. head-
aches, sleeplessness. lack of ambition and
a general run-down nervous condition I
advise them to take after each meal ono
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lowing the tablets to dissolve In the
mouth, and thus mingle with the food
eaten. The result Is that the food la
speedily digested before It has time to
sour and ferment. These tablets will di-
gest the food anyway whether the stom-
ach wants to or not, because they contain
harmless digestive principles, vegetable
essences, pepsin and Golden Seal which
Buppty Just what %-.e weak stomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with . great
success both In curing Indigestion and to
build up the tissues. Increasing flesh In
thin, nervous patients, whose real trouble
was dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
ach was put to rights they did not know
what sickness was.
A EO-cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be bought at any drug store,
and as they are not a secret patent medi-
cine they can be used as often as de-
sired with full assurance that they con-
tain nothing harmful In the slightest de-
gree; on the contrary, any one whoso
stomach is at all deranged will find great
benefit from the use oX Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets. They will cure any form of
stomach weakness or diseases except can-
cer of the stomach.

Kings County Growers Not Satisfied
HANFORD, June 12.â The aprlcot-grow
ers of Kings County have brought the
cannery combine to time here. When the
apricot season opened here the buyers for
Fontaha & Co. went through the county
here and offered the growers $15 per ton
for their fruit. The growers would not
sell them a pound of fruit at that price,
and informed the agents that they would
dry their fruit first, and nearly every man
in tho country that had a pound of apri
cots proceeded to make arrangements to
dry them.
Now the buyers for the combine are out
trying to buy apricots for $20 per ton, but
are getting very little fruit, as the grow
ers are getting 6H cents and 7% cents for
their apricots dried, and this is- better
than $20 per ton green, besides when they
sell to the cannery the fruit was to be
picked from the trees and assorted.
The manager of the cannery announced
to-day that the Indications are that the

is bringing good prices.

The measure provided for the repeal of 'ail
the ordinances granting franchises to the
various street railways incorporated in
the St. Louis Transit system since the
adoption of the city charter.
The City Council killed the Kelly bill
at its session this evening- by. a vote of
7 to 5. The jrallery was crowded with
large delegations of union labor people
and the speeches favoring its adoption
were enthusiastically cheered, while those
against the measure were hissed and
laughed at.
A number of men charged with com

The southern electric line is in operation
to-night for the first time since the strike
was Inaugurated. This line is regarded in
police circles as the most ' difllcult of all
the lines to run safely after dark. Every
precaution was taken to "prevent interfer

districts where two weeks ago seven per
sons were wounded by bullets in one day.
The Mayor's proclamation forbidding
the use of explosives or â¢ firearms, and
warning thoser having no business on the

on about the same schedule as last night.
LJnes to the north and south are still
guarded by police, but in -the central and
western portions there was no. trouble and
the police have been lr. a great measure
withdrawn from the cars. This permits
the strengthening of the forces along the
southwestern and southern divisions.
More men are now employed by the
company than there is work for them to

TATTERSALL'S. CHICAGO. June 12.â
George Dixon and Benny Yanger, the
"Tipton Slasher" fought six fast rounds to
a draw at Taqtersall's to-night. Yanger
surprised even ]hls most ardent admirers
by his excelled^ showing, as . up to six
months ago he was a comparative novice
in the ring. He was rather nervous dur
ing the first round and Dixon had a shade
the better of it. After that, however.
Yanger gained confidence and in the sec
ond round made an even break of it. Yan
ger had the better of the third round and
landed some telling blows on Dixon's
body.
The last three rounds were even, first
one gaining the advantage and then the
other.
Paddy Carroll refereed the go and
pleased the 7000 spectators by declaring it
a draw. The betting was 5 to 4 that Dixon
would win, but very little money was
placed at these odds.
In the semi-flnal wind-up Billy Stlft of
Chicago was given the decision over Jack
Jeffries, a younger brother of the heavy
weight champion. Jeffries was knocked
down in the first round, but after that he
put up a good fight, landing constantly
with his left. The decision was unpopu
lar. The majority of the spectators fa
vored Jeffries.
In the preliminaries Joe Percente of Chi
cago knocked out Con O'Leary of Mil
waukee In the first part of the second
round. Â¦ . . ,
Buddy Ryan won the decision over Jack
Ryan in six rounds.
Sammy Harris and Henry Lombard
fought s'lx fast rounds to a draw.

Jackson's rifle that lodged in the breast of
Ora Childs, a negresss, killing her. A shot
from the gun of one of the officers struck
Bennett in the head and he fell dead be

KBW YORK, June 12.â Terry McGovern
fully lived up to his title of featherweight
champion at the Seaside Athletic Club
to-night by knocking out Tommy White,
the clever Chicago man, in three rounds.
The little champion never showed better
form and gave his opponent no rest from
the sound of the gong in the opening
round until the referee had counted off
the fatal ten seconds. He took the stiff
jabs which White handed out to him with
a smile, and forced Tommy about the
ring with terriole drives to the body and
head. After the first round Whitens face
took on a frightened look and he clinched
repeatedly to save himself from punish
ment, but Terry tore away from his grasp
as though White were a baby. The crowd
looked for a quick ending, but there were
few present who expected the termination
to come so soon. The third round was a"
succession of knockdowns for White No
sooner would he regain his feet than he
would go down again, and after going
down for the seventh time he was so far
gone that it was impossible for him to
get up, although he made a game effort.
The men were to have fought twenty-five
rounds at 128 pounds.
Several challenges were Issued to Mc-
Govern before the bout, but it is doubt
ful If any who now aspire to his title
would go much further than White did.
\\ hen the boys appeared at the ringside
to weigh in Terry stepped on the scale
fully clothed and failed to move the beam,
but when White's turn came it was found
that he was half a pound overweight
McGovern made no objection. Just as
they were ready to enter the ring the
electric lighting apparatus gave out and
for about ten minutes the building was
in total darkness.
Johnny White officiated as referee.
In the opening round Terry immediate
ly assumed the aggressive and was first
to land with a left swing to the neck
White broke ground and tried a left lead
but Terry blocked and White went to a
clinch and was cautionea for holding.
They broke and Terry was forcing him
about the ring when the electric lights
again went out after two minutes of fight
ing. After about ten minutes the lights
were again lighted and the men were at
It again. Terry rushed and landed a left
hook that made White sink to the floor.
Terry assisted him to his feet and again
landed the same blow and followed with
both hands to the body Just as the bell
rang.
Terry went after him like a,, bull in the
pecond and White was twice cautioned for
holding. White jabbed Terry's face twice
with stiff lefts, jarring Terry's head, but
the champion sent a right to the ribs
that made Tommy bend. Again White
landed hia left and Terry responded with
left to belly and then hooked it to the
Jaw, sending White to the floor, tie got
up groggy and Terry dropped him again
with, the same blow just as the bell rang
When White came out for the third
time Terry Immediately dropped him with
a left on the jaw. He was up at five
and went down again with right on body
and head. He got to his feet again only
to go down. Three times more White was
floored. Each time he arose Terry bat
tered him with right and left to body and
head. After the seventh knockdown
Johnny White counted the full ten before
the fallen pugilist could get to his feet
and amid loud cheers Terry was declared
the winner.

STANFORD UXIVERSITY. June 12.â
The fraternity house under course
of erection by the Chi Psis Is to
face on Salvatierra row and Is lo
cated next to the Beta Theta Pi
house. It is to be one of the largest "and
best finished fraternity homes on the
campus.
The cost of buildinsr the house will be
in the neighborhood of $7000 and it is 'to
be finished about September 1.
Along the north front will extend a
veranda, from which the main entry ad
mits to the reception hall. The parlor,
dining-room and reception hall ' may be
thrown together to make plenty of room
for parties and on festival occasions. The
floors of these three rooms are of maple,
while the paneling is all finished in nat
ural wood. The kitchen and pantries ex
tend beyond the dining-room. And on the
second and third floors are bedrooms
sufficient to accommodate twenty-two
persons. Â¦
The Chi Psi Fraternity was founded at
Union College In 1841 and has now eight
een chapters in the different colleges of
the United States. It was established at
Stanford In 1&S5 and now has nine active
members here, as follows: Walter Gray,
William . Morrow, Samuel Wilson and
Freuerick Drake, of tne class of 1901; Don
Rea, Nathan Decker. Howard Shame,
Charles Davis, Frank Sharratt, of the
class of 1903. \
The Chi PsI house Is Just off from
"Fraternity Row," and will add a great
deal to the beauty of that part of the
campus. Other fraternity houses under
course of construction In the immediate
neighborhood are the Alpha Phi. Delta
Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta houses.
Besides these Mrs. Stanford will erect
several houses this summer for the use of
the faculty and Mr. Cooksey of Menlo
Park is building a $20,000 mansion on an
elevation at the head of the row, com
manding a view aown Lasuen avenue.
HONOLULU, June 5.â It may be taken
as almost a foregone conclusion that a
special session of the Legislature will be
called as soon as the Governor of the Ter
ritory of Hawaii is Installed. If thirty
days' notice is given on the 14th of June
the election will be-held on July 14, a Sat
urday, and the members could assemble
on Monday, July 23. This would bring the
session to a close about the end of Sep
tember. This, of course, is the very quick
est time in which a Legislature could be
called together, and it would get it closed
in ample time before the general election
comes on in November. '
Indeed, there Is no necessity for haste
such as this. If the Legislature does not
meet till the middle of August it would
easily be through with its work by the
end of October. The general election will
take place on November 6. This is the
other extreme and would make the ses
sion almost too close to election day.
.However, a mean can be found between
the two dates. /
The chief work will be registration.
There will no doubt be a heavy registra
tion and considerable time will have to be
given to getting an accurate list of voters.
The rules and regulations for administer
ing oaths and holding elections will be
the same as appears In Ballou's "Compila
tion of Civil Laws" (appendix), but mere
are considerable changes, which appear in
section 64 of the Territorial bill. Â»
The Board of Registration will consist
of three members appointed by the Gov
ernor and by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate. But for the first
election, as there is no Senate in session,
the Governor's appointments hold without
any Senatorial sanction. At one stage of
the bill the words "no more than two of
whom.shall be of the same political party"
were inserted after the words 'â¢shall con
sist of threes members," but the House
amendment was dropped out in the con
ference committee and the executive will
not have to investigate as to the political
views of his appointees.
The sum of $240,853 50 was paid out by
the plantations last week in dividends.
This money will greatly relieve the situa
tion. More is to be paid on the loth, and
the total on July 1 will be something
greater than in years before, if not in the
history of the country.
Ex-Queen Liliuokalani unexpectedly
arrived at about midnight last nieht on
the steamship City of Peking, defeating
the plans of those who were preparing
to give her a reception upon the arrival
of the Australia to-morrow. Her Majesty
is much changed in appearance, having
lost weight during her long stay abroad
and being In rather feeble health.. She
was driven at once to her Beretanla-
Btrect mansion, where, late as the hour
was, a few of her intimate advisers and
friends were received. It was early morn
ing when the returned ex-monarch retired
and to-day she is resting and declines to
receive visitors.
The ex-Queen is quoted as utterly op
posed to taking any part whatever In lo
cal polities. When asked for an expres
sion of her views she referred the Inquirer
to Joseph O. Carter, who stated that it
was certain that Liliuokalani would not
have anything to say about election af
fairs. "The ex-Queen will not take any
part in politics," said Mr. Carter. "She
has no reason to do" so, having nothing to
gain or lose either way. She will not side
with Democrats or Republicans, nor will
she join in any movement for an inde
pendent native party. The ex-Queeit has
had her fight and lost and been put down,
and now she is ready to live her own life
and give her attention to her private
property interests, which are much in
need of looking after.
"As far as 'W ashlngton Is concerned, the
ex-Queen does not expect any action Jn
her case at present. She stated to me
that Congress seemed to have too much
to do without giving attention to her.
Her Majesty would have met Mr. Mac
farlane In San Francisco had she not left
sooner than she expected to. Macfarlane
was to have arrived in San Francisco on
the day of the Australia's departure, and
he will probably arrive here to-morrow.
He may be able to say something of what
is likely to be done in Washington."

Nor was the astonishment unnatural. So great
was the excitement among the people on Mafckinjj
day and so universally was it shared by all classes
that some authorities among the British themselves
have come to the conclusion that the character of the
people lias changed. The outburst, according to
London papers, was not only unprecedented in Great
Britain, but in other lands. The Westminster Gazette
in reviewing the demonstration said:
"Except by its architectural features, London was
CHANGES IN BRITISH CHARACTER.
WHEN the reports of the extraordinary excite
ment in Great Britain over the relief of Lady
smith and Mafeking were received in this
country they were read with no little surprise. .- It
was the unexpected that had happened. The British
have for a long time cultivated a habit of suppressing
feeling. They have carried the blase air in society
to such an extent as to make it ridiculous and some
times offensive. They have delighted in showing
themselves calm, "cool, unmoved and half apathetic
r.ndcr all circumstances. It was supposed therefore
they would manifest the same stolidity during' the war
and consequently when they showed irritation at the
early ill success of their arms and upon the first good
news from the front burst out in a spasm of jubila

Auditor Wells yesterday held up two de

auditing any demands for June until all
bills previously Incurred are paid.
These particular expenditures were or
dered by Chief Sullivan, but the demands
do not specify for hat P"/ 1^ "J^

cut in two as authorization for payment
nfmima exceeding fcoO must be adver

They Will Be Placed Under Supervis
ion of Board. of Public
Works. "
An ordinance will be introduced at the
next meeting of the Board of Supervisors
providing for the issuance of permits for
the erection or alteration of buildings, im
posing fees for Inspection thereof and
providing for issuance of certificates of
construction. The object Is to place the
alteration of buildings under the super
vision of the Board of Public Works and
to transfer the power from the Fire
Wardens, who have hitherto had it in
charge. The bill has been submitted to
several architects and to the Builders'
Exchange and meets with their entire
approval. . .
k After permission has been obtained
from the Board of Public \V0rk3 to erect,
add to or enlarge a building thei applicant
shall file with the board a complete set
of plans and specifications of the pro
posed building, including the exact site,
the material dimensions and estimated
cost and the probable time to be occupied
In building. . The ordinance further pro
vides for the payment of $10 if theesti-~
mated cost is &000: $15 if more than $5000
and less than JlO.OoO, and for every addi
tional $1000 the further sum of 50 cents for
expenses of Inspection and examination of
plans. The Board of AVorks shall appoint
inspectors to supervise the work and shall
furnish the owner of such building a cer
tificate that it has been constructed In
conformity with existing laws for which
a ree of $1 shall be charged.

Members of the local Chinese ring, it is charged,
are scheming to destroy the efficiency of the Chinese
Bureau under the administration of the Immigration
Commissioner. It appears that these brokers in
human chattels seem to think that conspiracy is.no
longer a crime under Federal laws.
The Board of Health appears to have overlooked
the interesting fact that there is a large colony of un
quarantincd Chinese in the detention sheds of the Pa
cific Mail dock. These coolies have come direct
from the seat of the plague. Why do they escape the
watchful* eyes of the officers?
The local Board of Education is certainly entitled
to the earnest sympathy and commiseration of the
public. .For officials who claim to.be making every
effort to remove their department from the corrupt
ing influences of politics they are making a most sig
nal failure. .

Southern Pacific's Bight to Maintain
a Fence Thereon Is Ques
tioned. ,
The City Attorney has been directed by
the Board of Supervisors to ascertain if
the Southern Facific Company has any
ownership in Sherman street between
Wyoming avenue and the old San Jose
road. This action is the result of a peti
tion filed by the property owners in the
vicinity against the maintenance of a
barbed wire fence on either side of the
company's tracks, claiming that it is det-
rimental to property â¢interests, as Sher
man avenue is and always has been a
public street.

but It could not operate to establish a street

there is no public street across the company's

LAYS CLAIM TO PART
OF SHERMAN AVENUE
SChjOOL BOARD AND THE TEACHERS
OX Monday the Board of Education, emerging
from secret se-ss-ions, set about adopting ne*
rules for the regulation of teachers. Among
them was one declaring: "Any employe of this de
partment who willfully neglects to pay his or her just
debts, having the ability to do so, shall be subject
to suspension or dismissal from the department.'
Another rule declares: "Any teacher in this depart
ment who after proper examination by a physician
designated by the Board of Education shall be found
to be suffering from tuberculosis or offensive catarrh
shall be subject to dismissal."
The adoption of these rules for the purpose of cur
ing existing or expected ills among the teachers will
incline to the public to say to the board: "Physician,
heal thyself." The Board of Education has not been
prompt to pay the salaries of the teachers. How jhen
shall it demand that they pay their debts? Further
more, the board is reputed to be at this very time
engaged in concocting a scheme for increasing the
work of the teachers and reducing their pay. How
then are they to be ary better off in the future than
in the past, any more able to meet all their obliga
tions with cash?
Just why the board should have adopted this rule
dots not appear on the surface of things and has not
been explained. By its very wording it reflects upon
the teaching body. It intimates that some of them
having ability to pay their debts have refused to do
so, and that coercion has become necessary. It is
safe to assert that such reflection upon the teachers
h as uncalled for as it is unjust. The teachers had
suffered enough at the hands of the board before this
aspersion was put upon them, and when all the cir
cumstances of delay in payments and a threatened
reduction of salaries are taken into consideration the
r.cu- rale can hardly be regarded as other than a bit
of offensive impertinence.
The rule requiring teachers to submit to examina
tion by a physician, and subjecting to dismissal all
who suffer from tuberculosis or offensive catarrh,
ought to be applied to the members of the board as
â¢well as to the teachers. A physician skilled in politi
cal diseases mipht find among the members of the
board some who are badly afflicted with political tu
berculosis, or a species of offensive jobbery worse
than catarrh. It i? a widespread opinion that the evils
and diseases that injure our public schools are to be
found not so much in the teaching body as in the
Boards of Education. Therefore if there is to be
examination the public vould be glad to have experts
investigate and determine what sort of microbes are
working among the members of the board.
DURING the coming season of grand
opera at the Tivoli a number of
novelties will be produced. Among
them Verdi's "Falstaff," with Sa
lassa in the title role; "Hamlet" and Ha
levy's "Jewess' will be revived. Anna
Lichter will sing the soprano roles in
"Falstaff" and "Hamlet."
Edith Mason, late leading soprano of
the Southwell Opera Company, has left
for the East with her husband, Thomas
Persse. The Southwell Opera Company is
now in Honolulu for a season. Hattie
Belle Ladd will sing the leading soprano
roles in place of Edith Mason and Miss

A recent experiment in grand opera at
Lexington, Ky., has met with what thtr
Eastern papers designate an "immense
success." It was a performance in Eng
lish of "Carmen" by an entire company
of colored people, the Afro-American
Grand Opera Company, under the direc
tion of Theodore Drury. The audience at
Lexingtonâ half white, half coloredâap
plauded to the echo the efforts of. the
colored musicians, and it has been se
riously suggested that the company
should go on a tour. v The leader, Theo
dore Drury, who played Don Jose, is de
scribed as. a handsome, dignified, intelli
gent exponent of his part, and the Car
men, Madame Plato, as reasonably satis
factory in comparison with the great ones
of the role. Conductor Paret is also
praised, but the chorus comes in for criti
cism on a charge of musical rebellion.
The baton beats in vain for them; they go
their own sweet way.
One of the most interesting features of
the American "exhibits" at the Paris Ex
position, says F. S. "LivinRstone In the
Metropolitan, Is the band of the Carlisle
Indians. This band of sixty performers,
under the direction of Mr. Denis Whee
lock (of the Oneida tribe), has a large
classical repertoire â Wajrner, Beethoven,
Schumann, Bachâ and their very excellent
performance of this untom-tommy kind
of music comes as a huge surprise to
those familiar with their cacophonous at
tempts at harmony in their savage con
dition. One of Mr. "Wheelock's own com
positions, "From Savagery to Civiliza
tion." performed at the exposition, has
aroused considerable favorable attention.

BRIDE OF AN
ARMY OFFICER
DONNELLY TO THE POPULISTS.
WHATEVER views may be taken of the sound
ness of Ignatius Donnelly's theories on poli
tics or on the authorship of Hamlet, there
can be but one opinion concerning the character of
the man himself. His courage and his sincerity are
question. He has repeatedly shown those
! qualities in political, in literary and unscientific con
troversies, and now he has once more exhibited them
by standing stahchly for the doctrines of Populism
in spite of all the Bryanites have been able to do or
to offer by way of inducing him to abandon them.
His letter of acceptance of the nomination for Vice
President on the straight Populist ticket is clear, vig
orous and manly. He believes he is right, and so be
lieving does not intend to compromise with wrong
for the sake of getting office himself or enabling any
one else to do so.
Upon the money question Donnelly, like a true
Populist, objects not only to the gold standard, but
to any metallic standard whatever, and exposes the
absurdity of the position of the silver men. Starting
with the assumption, "To supply the 'people with
money is the supreme function of government," he
argues "there is no more reason for making our
money of metals than there is for engraving our na
tional bonds on plates of gold, or printing our post
age stamps on tags of silver." He is faithful to his
fundamental principle amrK carries it to the logical
conclusion by demandingn-he retirement of all kinds
of metallic money and bank notes and the creation by
the Government of an ample supply of money for its
people by an issue of greenbacks.
Donnelly is too clear-sighted to be deceived by the
specious promise that the principles of Populism can
be advanced by the election of Bryan. He asks the
question: "Can ,we reach the ends we have in view
through the Democratic party?" Then he answers:
"Suppose that the old Whig party, instead of decently
dying in 1856. when it had outlived its function, had
lingered superfluous on the stage, and the people of
the United States had tried to use it as an instrumen
tality to destroy slavery, could they possibly have
succeeded? No; they would have found half of. its
membership favorable to slavery and half opposed to
it; and instead of reform we should have had con
tinuous internecine warfare. Slavery was destroyed
by a party every member of which was opposed to
slavery. Plutocracy will never be overthrown by the
Democratic party, with its head in Wall street and its
tail in the Mississippi Valley. We must have a party
dreadfully in earnest and in which there is not a
single plutocrat. If ten horses are hitched to the
front of a cart, and ten horses, equally strong, arc
fastened to the tail end, will not the cart stand still?"
There is no escaping the logic of that conclusion.
Genuine Populism has nothing to hope for from a
party whose New York leaders are members of Tam
many Hall and owners of stock in the ice trust, and
whose candidate for^the Presidency is in close affilia
tion with Tammany. Donnelly is wrong to the verge
of folly in the ends he aims at, but he is perfectly ra
tional and right as to the means of obtaining them.
Moreover, he is to be given credit for his sincerity
and honesty in remaining true to his convictions, not
withstanding all the blandishments the Bryanites have
brought to bear to coax him to consent to fusion. .

McKINLEY. AND THE ENVOYS"
COLONEL BRYAN is an incessant hunter after
effect in politics. He turns over everything-to
see if it can be turned to account and help serve
his ambition.
He has taken up the Boer envoys for the votes they
may contain and is using them for one of his ex
hibits. He objects to our Government denying, them
an alliance and taking up their cause, regardless of
the Monroe doctrine and common sense. The sym
pathy of the people and of the members of the Gov
ernment at Washington are not withheld from the
Boers, but what one may do as an individual and
what he may do as President are quite different
things. Colonel Bryan has never been anything but
an individual and he may honestly think, if he ever
thinks at all, that as President he would do just what
he does as an individual, but he is mistaken. He has
criticized President McKinley because in his inter
view with the Boer envoys he entertained them in
conversation and waited for them to introduce the ob
ject of their visit. Any tyro in official matters, or in
social matters, either, knows that the President can
neither ask what official visitors come for, rior an
ticipate their declaration of their errand, nor stand
stupidly and say nothing until they announce the
purpose of their visit. When the envoys called at
the White House the President received them gen
ially and entertained them in conversation until they
were ready to say what they came for. Not only
official etiquette, but the usages of ordinary considera
tion and politeness were observed. The President
did his duty, not only in the personal kindliness of
his demeanor, but in refusing to raise any false hopes
as to the pow$r- of this Government to give official
aid and comfort to the Boers. Aware that what he
said and what he refrained from saying would alike
be misrepresented and used to his disadvantage, he
refused to use the envoys and the South African war
for personal political purposes. Had he been unmind
ful of his public duty, or had he no higher concep
tion of it than its use for his. personal advantage, the
way was easy for him to give the envoys such assur
ances as would have personally strengthened him in
domestic politics. But to do this would have required
the implication of a promise that cannot be kept
and the raising of hopes in the Boers that could
cnly be disappointed. The President abstained. For
getting himself as a candidate for re-election, putting
what politicians would call the interest of his party
aside, and, indeed, sinking his individual sympathies,
he stood, as he ought, the representative of a Gov
ernment that is the trustee of the Western hemi
sphere, bound by the Monroe doctrine not to intei
fere in the affairs of European nations.
Where it was easy to forget his public obligation
as President and further his fortunes as a politician,
he did right in seeing nothing but his public duty.
While this course was right to his own country, it was
also the right course for the Boers. Suppose he had,
cither vaguely or directly, encouraged them to look
for the only interference possible, an alliance and
declaration of war against England, what man of
sense believes that the country would permit either
or would tolerate support of such action by Congress?
Yet when Colonel Bryan says that the envoys
should have been received as France received Frank
lin in 1776, he knows, if he know anything, that
Franklin was received as representative of an ally
of France in a war between that kingdom and Great
Britain. He knows also that such a reception of the
Eoer envoys by President McKinley would have vio
lated every great doctrine upon which our institutions
are based. It would have ended the Monroe doctrine.
It would have amounted to a declaration of war by
the President, when the constitution deprives him of
the power to plunge the country into war. It would
have unbalanced our own Government and disturbed
the world's peace. But it would have been a splendid
stroke of personal politics for the President had he
been reckless enough to have indulged in it.
It is greatly, to his credit and his honor that he put
away temptation and refused to injure his country
and its institutions and. encourage the Boers to hope,
cnly to be disappointed?
From the attitude of Colonel Bryan we are to infer
that if he become President he will not let' such a
chance slip. Any time that he can make a false play
in foreign affairs for the sake of its effect on domestic
politics he will make it.
He must not object to be judged by his own decla
rations, and this is what they mean. The infirmity of
Colonel Bryan .is that he talks more than it is possible
for him to think. Every windmill that is running
is not pumping water. Bryan's vocal organs are
mostly uncoupled from his mental works. He has a
talented tongue and a fair vocabulary. That part of
his equipment is all right. But it 'is like a windmill
disconnected from the pump.
He divides the voters into two classes; those who
know that he could not carry into official action the
fool things he says, and those who honestly believe
he will. The latter class support him because they
want harm done and think he can do it; the former
tolerate him because they think he can't do any harm,
anyway. Between these two sentiments he expects
such a contribution of votes as will make him Presi
dent. It is for this icason that he imports foreign
issues into domestic politics.
In no other matter developed in their careers is
there a better illustration of the radical and character
istic difference between Bryan and the President.
McKinley, with every political and partisan interest in
the balance, tempted to deceive the Boers by impos
sible promises and make at* tfle same time a hit in
domestic politics, refrains and acts the President of n
republic that emblazons the Monroe doctrine on its
shield and is the self-respecting gentleman at the
same time.
unrecognizable on Saturday. From early thorn : till
after midnight there was a crowding, a bedecking,
a gayety, a flag-waving, a processioning, a singing, a
shouting, a trumpeting, a cheering that, taken to
gether,' stand unparalleled in all probability in the
records of j any capital in the world's history. And
as it was in the capital, so it was in proportion
throughout the kingdom aqd the empire. Verily, an
unmatched and overwhelming celebration.-'
In the course of the jubilation all forms of extrava
gance and folly were committed. The Gazette went
on to say:
"A careful observer^writes in the Daily News that
girls and 3'oung men^danced, embraced and kissed on
Saturday without any previous acquaintance. Pea
cock's feathers were in very large demand and (as our
contemporary points out) they brought good luck
to many a young man on Saturdays TheÂ»manner"and
purpose of their use arc easily told. With this in
strument the youth would, by way of introduction,
gently stroke the maiden's face, whereupon, if she
smiled he would ask, 'May I have a kiss?' and if she
said 'No' in a way that meant 'Yes' he would straight
way give himself the pleasure. Along the Strand,
and up the Haymarket and down Piccadilly the
smack of kisses was a sound thatjeounted, even amid
the hurly-burly of trumpetirg, shouting, cheers and
lauchter." ?
With such a record as that upon which to base con
clusions it is not strange that a French writer should
pronounce judgment that "the British soul is in de
cadence, that it has no longer a right to laugh at
French exaggerations and that it knows not now l,w
to imitate, as once it did, the stoicism of Rome, im
passible in defeat and in victory."

CHANGES JN CONTRACTS
FOR PUBLIC LIGHTING
Committee Decides to Award Two, Six
Months to Be Period of
Bach. V. ".,
The Supervisors' Committee on Artifi
cial Lights decided yesterday to invite
bids for the electric lighting of public
buildings and streets; so that for the next
fiscal year there will be two contracts of
six months each. The bids will be consid
ered separately and the awards will be
made to the lowest bidder. This plan in
sures the submission of. competitive rates,
as the Independent Light and Power Com
pany will not be prepared to furnish elec
tric lights throughout the city until the
second half of the fiscal year.
It was also decided to call for bids for
the electric lighting of each public build
ing Instead of for all, as heretofore, the
two contracts to be for six monthg each.
The plans prepared by Gas Insepctor Tup
per call for tho lighting of 4520 gras lamps,
but the number was reduced to 4000, which
Is considered sufficient to light the city.
The requirement that the bidders must
have connecting-pipes and wires with the
gas inspector's office in order that the
lights may bo tested was ordered elim
inated from the specifications.

The exercisrs opened with the march of
the class of 1900 into the rooms where the
graduation exercises were held. When
the members had taken their places on
the stage Principal Bush spoke briefly.
He welcomed the visitors, who were
many, and explained that some of tho
graduates had been called away by their
parents to assist them in their business
and that others had accepted positions
where they wore beginning to earn a liv
ing. These facts were evidences of the
usefulness of the training received in the
school, the principal said.
A chorus of boys and girls sang "Away
to the Forest." Miss Lottie Llnne recited
spiritedly a selection illustrative of the
difficulties encountered by the primary
teachers. The Misses Lydia and Angle
Spadie sang a duet with such fine effect
that they were encored. Frank J. Symmes
made a brief address, congratulating the
graduates and saying other pleasant
things. After the chorus had sung a med
ley a mock presentation of the class pic
ture took place. It is customary for each
graduating class to supply a group picture
of the members, to be hung in the school.
This year the pictures were not completed
in time. Therefore a large screen, draped
Jn black, but embellished with flowers and
ribbons, the class year being indicated in
City Institutions of Learning
Gave Merited Tokens
to Students.

Does Much Damage to Farms, but No
ELK CREEK. Neb.. June 12.â A tornado
did much damage In the farming country
west of here this afternoon. It formed,
seemingly, on the Trudy farm and the
funnel-shaped cloud missed the village
by but eighty rods. The greatest dam
age was at the W. J. Blystone farm,
where the house was wrecked and barns
and outbuildings blown away. The fam
ily took refuge in the cellar and escaped.
Damage was also done on the farms of
K. H. Bdone. E. C. Thompson and J. W.
Parker but the extent is unknown. Some
of the best fruit orchards have been torn
to pieces. There is no known loss of life.
Says They Are the Greatest Existing
Menace to the Govern
ment.
WASHINGTON. June 12.â Henry F. De
vens of New York, assistant Secretary of
the Metal Trades Association, was before
the Industrial Commission to-day. Ho
gave the employers' version of the Chi
cago settlement with the International
Machinists' Association. He spoke with
confidence on the benefits to be de
rived from the arbitration clause in
the agreement, saying that he believed
It woÂ»ild prove an efficient method of
settling all difficulties In the future. Ha
also expressed the opinion that a board of
arbitrators composed of men in the work
would bo more acceptable than a State
board.
N. F. Thompson, secretary of the South
ern Industrial Convention of Huntsville,
Ala., made a somewhat sensational attack
upon labor unions. "Labor organizations
are to-day," said Thompson, "the greatest
menace to this Government that exists In
side or outside the pale of our national
doraainvTheir influence for disruption and
disorganization of society is far more dan
gerous to the perpetuation of our Govern
ment in its purity and power than would
be the hostile array on our borders of tha
armies of the entire world combined."

ous acts which led up to the decision of
tho Supreme Court compelling the Asso

to the Inter Ocean Publishing Company,
refers to the entering of the decree May

of the court, and gives in detail the\ re
cent meeting ot the Associated Press,
when several of the old officers resigned
and new officers were elected.
According to the allegations of the bill
the change in officers was for the pur
pose oÂ£ allowing the organization of a new
association which would gradually take
on the business of the association against
which the judicial ruling had been made.
The Inter Ocean Publishing Company as a
shareholder In the Associated Press of
Illinois objects to the organization of the

of New York). Melville E. Stone general
manager; Stephen O'Meara, Adolph pchs,

porary injunction restrains the defendants
from doing business under the name of
"The Associated Press" and from Interfer
ing with or fronrattempting In any manner
to Injure or destroy the business of the
Associated Press of Illinois and from in
terfering with the business thereof, or en
deavoring to cause any party, firm or cor
poration to annul- or cancel or break its
contract with the Associated Press of Il
linois and from sending any circular to
tha members of the Associated Press of
Illinois, or In any other manner soliciting
or asking them to Join and become mem
bers of the Associated Press, incorporated
under the laws of the State of New York.
. A prayer asking that the temporary re
straining order be made perpetual Is ap
pended to the bill.

CHICAGO, June 12. â Wheat opened easy on
pressure from lines, July V4c Â¦ lower to un
changed at 72^<g73Vic. The Northwest was
still without rain and very unfavorable crop
reports from that section! of the spring wheat
country continue to pour In. July In the first
movements advanced to 73%c and a little later,
after a slight check, pushed on to 74&c. A
huge business was transacted; the pit was
crowded and speculators excited and nervous.
At that hlfih-tiUe of its strength an opposing
factor presented itself In tho weather bureau
prediction of rain In the Dukotas and Minne
sota. This influence was reinforced later by
advice? from the Northwest that rain was al
ready falling. Some towns said the roln was
h'-ao* and persistent. These considerations
gradually forced July back to 73Â®73^4c. Near
the clcs<Â» the market rallied to 73^ic on cover-
Ing by bhorts and the closo was firm, July >4c
higher at 73V4c
Corn was quiet but flrm. The market ad
vanced early In sympathy with the wheat
bulge nnd yielded very Btubbornly when, tho
big market reacted. July closed firm, %@V*i:
over yesterday at 3S%@39c.
In oats there was a quiet but steady market.
The only incident of the trade was the Kood
outside demand for present delivery. July
closed MiC improved at 22%c.
Provisions wt're quiet and rather dull. Prices
at the yards were lower and receipts were
large. July pork clcsed 27 3 ,4c under yesterday

um and fine scoured. Fleece wools are slow
with no quotable price on which to base the
mnrket. Quotations:

London Market.
NEW YORK, June 12.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram say3:
The markets here were slack to-day, but
slightly harder on the news of the successes
of General Duller. Americans fluctuated with
in narrow limits on varying rumors about the
Northern Paciiic dividend. The close was
rather weak on New York offers, except for
Atchisons. The Continent did nothing. Berlin
was occupied with Its crisis in Industrials.
The contango was 3MÂ®4 P^r cent. Baltimore
and Ohio, Wabash preferred, St. Paul and
Central Pacifies were scarcer than at the last
settlement. Tlntos were affected by the strike
and other copper shares were sympathetically
off. The Bank of England received Â£80.000 In
EcM from Egypt and sold Â£25.000 in French
coin besides losing Â£26,000 to South America.
A half-mtlilon which was expected from Rus
sia did not materialize.

less selling pressure than expected. Light rains
were reported from Bismarck and other scat
tering Dakota points. There were showers in
Minnesota. These sprinkles eased oft the mar
ket somewhat, but the excitement was subse
quently renewed on rush orders from the North
west to buy. The most optimistic predicted
only half a crop in the Northwest .and the
cplnion was that even a general rain would
only make the difference between half. a\crop
and none at all. , \
The local market opened firm on call, but fell

A circular for Australia says: "Since the
departure of the steamer Alameda the follow
ing vessels have delivered Newcastle coal here,
viz: Clan Buchanan. 3162 tons; Elmhurst, 2520
tons; Balclutha, 26G0 tons; Windsor Park. 200}
tons: total. 10,342 tons. All of the above
named vessels have arrived since June 3. They
ha\'e come to hand most opportunely, as there
was no Australian coal In Jobbers' hands.
There are reported forty-four vessels on the
chartered list to carry colonial coal, with a
capacity of 116,000 tons â thirty-four of these
have not yet reached their loading; port*.
There are ten colonial vessels due here within
sixty days, with about 33.00) tons. There Is
no apparent change In prices, although the
demand Is brisk, and the absolute control of
the market is placed in about four firms'
hands, yet they appear disinclined to assert
their sway, which is stngularly exceptional In
these times of syndicates and trusts. Last
quoted freight rate is IS shillings per ton
from Newcastle early loading, and one shilling
less for later; this makes the delivery cost
i here all the article will stand; as British Co
' lumbla products can be had for less cost, this
Â¦ precludes any further advance In Australian
rates. Outward grain freights from here are
firm, with a strengthening tendency, making
this a seductive port for shipowners to seek,
as the present coal freight inward, added to
the grain freights outward, show a handsome
bonus for ship's account."

CONSUL MARTIN
ASKS FOR A CRUISER
WASHINGTON, Juno 12.â The following
dispatch was received at the State De
partment to-day:
"CHIN KIANG. Juno 12.â Secretary of
State: I^arge numbers of natives have
organized a secret society here. People
are very apprehensive. No protection.
Want crulner. MARTIN."
Mr. Martin Is the Consul at Chin KJang
and his telegram is the first news re
ceived here to indicate the spread of the
Boxer agitation in that portion of China.
Chin Klang is ono of the most Important
treaty ports in China. It Is located on
the Yang-tse-KianK. a little over 100 miles
above the point where the Wo Sung en
ters, and Is about 125 miles from Shanjr
hal. At the latter port the United States
gunboats Yorktown and Castlne are now
lying, undergoing repairs. Tho extent of
these is not known at the Navy Depart
ment, but assuming that they are not
more extensive than usual. It Is said that
one or both of the vessels might be dis
patched to Chin Klang in a day or two.
However, up to this moment no orders
have gone forward to either of the ves
sels or to Admiral Remey. There is an
intimation at the State Department that
the Consul at Chin Ktang has exagger
ated the danger of the situation and that
the mere halting near the town of a num
ber of Boxers is not evidence that they
have any hostile Intentions against the
American consulate.

The groom is a machinist, employed by

he went to the bride's parents and after
greeting his wife told the Story of the
marriage. As soon as the old folks had
recovered from their surprise the parental
blessing was bestowed and Mr. and Mrs.
Jackson departed to prepare for a home
of their own.
OAKLAND, June 12.-"In behalf of
my client, the city of Oakland, 1
ask that you do not try this case."
So said ex-Supreme Court Com
missioner Robert Y. Hayne, special coun
sel for the city of Oakland in Department
No. 3 of the Superior Court of Alameda
County, to Superior Judge E. C. Hart of
Sacramento County, who is sitting for
Judge Ogden in the trial of the case of
the Contra Costa Water Company against
the city of Oakland to test the water
rates fixed by the City Council.
It was a very remarkable request to
make, but the conditions under which it
was made were as remarkable as the re
quest. . Judge E. C. Hart of the Sacra
mento Superior bench had been invited
by Judge Ogden to sit as the trial Judge
in this very important litigation over
water rates as Judge Ogden deemed him
self disqualified as he was a rate .payer
and consequently a party at Interest.
Judge Hart has made several trips from
Sacramento to Oakland and has heard
one demurrer and one application for per
mission to examine books, both of which
went against the city of Oakland.
This morning Robert Y. Hayne and As
sistant City Attorney Condon filed two
documents with Judge Hart. One was an
other motion to be permitted to examine
the books of the Contra Cosfa Water
Company and the other was a request
that Judge E. C. Hart withdraw from the
case, and making the legal statement that
his selection was not legal because If
Judge Ogden was disqualified from trying
the case he was also disqualified from
selecting' a Judge who should try it.
At first Judge Hayne based his request
for the retirement of Judge Hart solely
upon legal grounds. He confined his ar
gument to the text of his request, which
was that being disqualified to try the
case Judge Ogden was equally disqualified
to select a Judge. All morning long and
far into the afternoon arguments upon
these dry legal lines continued, until
Judge Hart announced from the bench
that he hardly thought the reasons given
Justified any such request.
As soon as Judge Hart grasped the
meaning of the request of the city he
said:
"This places me In a very embarrassing
position. I was invited to sit in this case
and accepted, and I certainly do not feel
like sitting If the attorneys in the case
feel that they cannot get a fair and im
partial trial from me."
"While a Judge may have some delicacy
about sittlnff under these circumstances,
still he should not shirk a duty once as-
Kumed," said A. A. Moore.
It being a case of Judges In all kinds of
positions. Judge Ogden could not be
spared, and his Honor was called as a
witness in the court where he usually sat
as Judge. Â¦ .
It was during the afternoon session that
Judge Hayne made the specific request
of Judge Hart that he would not sit as
the trial Judge In the case. Judge Hart
took occasion to make a statement of con
siderable length, In which he Intimated
that he did not consider the legal grounds
advanced by Mr. Hayne as sufficient to
have him retire from the case.
"This- position is certainly very awk
ward and embarrassing," said Judge
Hart. "When I was Invited by â¢ Judge
Ogden to pit In this case it was. of course,
a compliment, and I so considered it. I
consented only al a considerable sacri
fice. One of the Judges of Sacramento
County is sick and the other departments
are crowded with work.
"I have met but one of the- Judges of
this county, and him but once. I have
met none of the attorneys In this action
but one, and him but once. When I was
Invited to sit in this case I know nothing 1
about the case or thÂ« noluts Involved. I
PRINCIPALS IN OAKLAND'S LATEST LEGAL TANGLE \
have heard one demurrer, which I deemed
it my duty to deny. Later I heard Judge
Hayne's application for permission to ex
amine books, and felt it my duty to deny
that under the ,law. I came here this
morning to hear another application for
an order to examine the books of this
company, and I am willing to hear such
an application when It Is not made too
broad. I am met with a motion to retire
from the case, made by one of the parties
concerned.
"I know po far as any prejudice or bias
In thl? case Is concerned that I have
absolutely no feeling in the matter I
know no one connected with the case save
a few of the citizens of Oakland. I have
come here to accommodate the counsel
for both sides, and I am a little sensitive
over this proceeding. No such proceeding
has ever been instituted against me. if
there be any specific cause why I should
not try this case counsel should say so
and I would not sit. It is a question of
propriety whether I shall sit in this caÂ«e
or not."
"Since Judge Hart has requested that
counsel state their position. I must re
quest that you do not try this case." re
plied Judge Hayne.
This statement was followed by attack
and counter attack from the contending
attorneys.
"A Judge is not to be scared off the
bench with that kind of a bogy man "
said A. A. Moore quickly.
"I protest against Mr. Moore's state
ments." replied Judge Hayne. "There is
no effort beln* made to scare any one
off the bench." .
"Your Honor could not come down un
der fire. To do that would be to smirch
the bench," said Mr. Moore.
"I object to these Insinuations and as
sertions.',' replied Judge Hayne. "We
came here to argue legal points. When
your Honor asks us If we are dissatisfied
why should we not answer? We have
said nothing offensive., but In the most
respectful manner have answered your
Honor's question."
"Judge Hayne has made no charges,
but has merely paid that he does not want
yoi*r Honor," said E. J. McCutcheon. "In
so doing ho admits that he has no reason,
but merely makes a suggestion."
Judge Hart finally declared a recess In
order to consult with the other Judges of
the superior bench' of Alnmeda County
Upon his return he took ' the bench and
"I will listen to the arguments upon the
legal phase of this matter to-morrow
morning. I have not thought sufficiently
upon the personal phase, as yet, but I
feel that if I retire now Â»lt will be
an acknowledgment upon my part that I
was biased or prejudiced."
"I am very sorry, if you feel that way,
that you drew me out," said Judge Hayne
.""I .will listen to the law to-morrow
morning, and I may even decide to with
draw without that consideration, but I
vill listen to the legal arguments to-mor
row." replied Judge Hart.
But this Is. hardly more than could be
expected from this case, for it is one of
the most important cases in the State. It
involves law points that must stand for
years to come, and the whole question of
the relation of the water companies to
the people, of the right of water compa
nies to combine and demand interest" upon
their Investment, of the right to abnor
mally increase the Investment of water
companies In order to secure interest
thereon, will nil have to be gone into.
The eyes of millions of Invested .'capital
and of the entire water consuming popu
lation of the State are turned toward the
trial of this case.

it the writer stated that he Intended to

A young man, whose name from letters

Police Officer Engel on Kearny street,
near Pine, early this morning and showing
him a bottle labeled "carbolic acid," asked
him if he wanted to see a man commit
suicide. The officer grabbed the youth,
took the bottle from him and sent him to
the Receiving Hospital. There Jackson
went Into convulsions and it was thought
he had swallowed strychnine.

for the mistake made by their chief.
Chief Sullivan charged the three patrol
men with permitting Chinese to pass

were on duty last week and of accepting
money from the Chinese. The Chief con

PATROLMEN ABE
ACQUITTED BY
COMMISSIONERS
WASHINGTON, June 12. - Although
there Is much conflict as to the status of
the revolution in Colombia, all advices
agree that armies aggregating 25.000 or
30,000 men have been facing each other,
with sanguinary results. The Colombian
Charge d 1 Affaires here. Dr. Luis Cuervo-
Marques, said to-day that the official in
formation coming from the Colombian
capital showed that the revolutionists had
been forced back to the Venezuelan fron
tier, and that contrary advices received
by the Navy Department here yesterday
referred to local conditions around Pan
ama, unconnected with the main theater
of war. $
He says the Government has an army
of 70.000 men at various points and tha.i
the main body of about 15.000 men has
borne the brunt of recent engagements.
They are armed with Mauser rifles, with
Remington smokeless powder, and have
Maxim rapid-fire guns and heavier field
guns of the Creusot make. The revolu
tionists also have Mausers and Maxims.
They have a Erunboat, and another was
used for transport and fighting purposes.
The Government has four gunboats, three
on the Atlantic and one on the Pacific
side.
The revolutions are well organized, not
only on the field but abroad, with influ
ential friends here. According to the
other side of the case, as stated by one
of their adherents to-day, the conflicting
claims of success are due largely to nego
tiations recently carried on as to the Pan
ama canal. Desirous of securing addi
tional war funds, the Government pro
posed an extension of the canal conces
sion, whereupon the revolutionists' agents
abroad gave notice that if the funds were
advanced the extension would not be rec
ognJzed in case of the success of the revo
lution. Dr. Cuervo-Marques says as to
this, however, that his Government would
not resort to a falsification of war news
in order to advance Its financial condition,
and as an evidence of the reliability of
the Government claims he points out that
the dispatches come from his brother,
who is Minister of Foreign Affairs at Bo
gota, and are to a certain extent personal
and non-political. He expresses every
confidence that the Government will
maintain its control of affairs.
In official quarters it is stated that some
of the countries adjacent to Colombia,
notably Venezuela. Ecuador and Nicara
gua., arc lending assistance to the revolu
tion, and that its effect may be far-reach
ing on this account.

Friends of Father McN ally-
Hold a Reception in
His Honor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, June 12.
The thirtieth anniversary of the or
dination of Rev. J. B. McNally. pastor of
St. Patrick's parish. West Oakland, was
celebrated last evening by the parishion
ers and friends with an entertainment
and a reception In honor of the popular
clergyman.
The festival was for a two-fold purpose.
Father McNally had only recently re
turned from Arizona, where he had been
recuperating after a long Illness, and his
flock made the celebration one of rejoicing
as well for his regained health.
The reception was held at St. Patrick's
Hall. During the evening the alumni of
St. Patrick's Institute gave an entertain
ment. Then the young ladies of the so
dality presented cleverly a farce, "The
Champion of Sex," the characters being
sustained by Miss Ella Flynn. Miss Stella
Long, Miss Sabrina Flanigan, Miss JoslÂ«
O'Connell, Miss Margaret Sheehan. Miss
Christina Murphy, Miss Mary Harrington
and Miss Catherine O'Hearn. Refresh
ments were served and Father McNally
recited some original verse. In referring
to the reception he said:
"'I am only 30 years oldâ that Is, I have
been In the ministry thirty years. I
greatly appreciate the light and pleasant
way in which you have seen* fit to remem
ber me. I know that in my heart I have
enjoyed every moment of it all."
Among the guests were Dr. and Mrs.
Maher, Miss Mathews, Mr. and Mrs.
Brophy, Miss Brophy and Rev. J. M.
White.

Grazer Not Guilty of Assault.
OAKLAND, June 12.â Adolph Grnzer
was acquitted to-day by a Jury in Judge
Greene's court of a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon. He was accused of
clubbing William Johnson on the head
with a bung-starter during a row at the
Three-mile House on the San Leandro
road.
OAKLAND, June 12.â Many of the la
dies of the Oakland Club are now
giving their time and attention to
the vacation schools, which promise
to be of much value to the children of the
poorer districts of the city. Encouraged
by the success attending the opening of
the kindergarten at the Garfleld School
in East Oakland yesterday, the members
t>t the club are striving to make the vaca
tion school, which is to be established
next week at the Tompklns schoolhouse
in West Oakland, a like success.
When the ladies who volunteered to
take charge of the Garfleld School ap
peared yesterday morning there were fifty
children, ranging in age from 5 to 11 years,
who wanted to be enrolled. As many of
these as could be cared for were taken
in charge and it Is expected that within
a few days all may be accommodated.
"What we need now," said Mrs. Henry
Goodcell. one of the earnest workers for
successful vacation schools, to-day, are
appliances for use in athletics. Men are
now at work erecting swings and seesaws
for the children, but other things are
needed, such as footballs, baseballs, bats
and such things that are calculated to at
tract the small boy and make him realize
that to attend the vacation school Is both
more pleasurable and more profitable
than to. spend his time on the street cor
ners. During the severe weeks of
the regular school vacation we
shall see that the children are given a
number of outings. There will be trips
to the surrounding country districts, such
as Haywards and Dimond Canyon and
possibly San Rafael may be included, as
it was last year. These trips Into the
country mean much to the children and
if the transportation companies will treat
us kindly we will be able to do a great
deal for our young charges."
The principal object of the vacation
schools is to remove from evil Influences
the vounjr children who are now com
pelled to roam the streets. The teachers
in charge, are kind and sympathetic, and
Instead of rigid discipline the little boys
and girls are made to understand that
they are beings of Intelligence and must
rely upon themselves.
The girls are taught the branches of do
mestic art, such as sewing and other
duties of the household. Pleasant tasks
are also assigned to the boys, and with
out exception the teachers declare that
after a day or two at the school nothing
can induce th* children to leave. Each
morning before the repular session com
mences the children are lined up In theÂ»
school yard, where they recite the "Civic
Creed" and salute the national flag as It
is being hoisted to the breeze.
In addition to training the minds and
bodies of their youthful charces the Oak
land Club members are doing much to
supply their physical needs in the way of
clothing. Whenever a more than usually
dilapidated lad or lass appears he or she
is furnished wltn a pair of shoes, a hat.
or a frock, as the- case may be. This char
itable work Is bring done In the most un
ostentatious manner, and the beneficiaries
are spared the\humillatlon of publicity.
The vacation school for the West Oak
land districts will be opened next Monday
morninp. Among: the earnest workers* In
the cause are Mrs. Henry Gnodcell, Mrs.
G. \V. Bunnell. Miss Mary McClees. Mlsa
Alice McChesney. Mrs. O. \V. Klnney.
Miss Morgan, Miss T. E. Brown and Miss
M. Carleton.

1118 Broadway. June 12.
Before his wife ''and some friends near
him could stay his hand Frank Rose, a
"prominent resident of Nlles, swal
lowed the contents of a vial of
strychnine last night In the door
way of his home. Then the desperate man
ran to a blacksmith shop near by and
bolted the door against those who rushed
after him. Mrs. Kose fainted, while wit
nesses to the deed summoned a physician.
The door of the shop was broken .down
and Rose was found, writhing In pain.
Antidotes were given and all night long
there was a fight to save his life. Ills
recovery is yet in doubt.
ThQ attempt at suicide was the result
of years of. domestic trouble, prompted. It
Is "said, by Rose's jealousy of his wife.
The news of his action created much ex
citement in the town, where Rose was
born and has lived all his days. lie is
one of the leading business men of that
section of Alameda County.
Half an hour before he took the poison
Rose went to Sneden's drug store and
purchased the drug, saying he wanted to
kill rats that were overrunning his stable.
He had been standing in front of the barn
after sending his wife to their home,
which is nexc door. As Constable Roder
ick parsed he heard Rose say. "Do you
see that?" holding a email bottle In his
hands.
Roderick turned to the stableman and
Rose continued;
"That's poison, and 1 am going to
take It."
. Mrs. Rose heard the threat, as did sev
eral others, and they ran toward him.
Before they could snatch the bottle from
his handa Rose had Bwallowed the con
tents and fled.
Mrs. Kose declared that her husband
had acted queerly for some time, and his
friends had also noticed his strange
moods. Several years ago Rose and his
wife quarreled. Again last fall there was
more trouble between them, and the hus
band appears to have been morose over
the difficulties. He Is 40 years old. The
Roses have five children.
For many years Kose has been a deputy
sheriff for the, Nile? district. Several
years ago he was the partner of John Ber
nnrd in the livery business at Niles, but
that partnership was dissolved and Rose
>ttri; then has been in business by him
self.

EATS ANYTHING
Since Leaving Off Coffee.
"I wish to give my experience with
ev--SS.ee for the benefit of other people. I
used coffee for several years and was a
terrible sufferer from dyspepsia. The
doctor told me not to use coffee or tea
and put me on a light diet, and I felt
better. : -"(
"Then I commenced to drink coffee
again and had the same trouble come
on. â¢ /â¢ >
"One day I told 3 friend about it. who
said that if I would stop drinking coffee
altogether I would feel better, and ad-
vised me to use Postum Food Coffee in
its place.
"I tried the Postum but did not like
it, so I told him about it and he said I
didn't cook it ripht, that is. didn't boil
it enough, and that I should use cream
instead of milk, and to make sure I
would use it he sent a package to the
house.
"After I used that package I would
have no more coffee in the house. Now
I don't know what it is to have dyspep-
cia and I can eat anything. I also give
Posrum to my two children and they are
the healthiest children you could find
anywhere The younpest is a boy 13
months old and we have been giving
him Postum for seven months, three
times a day. He weighs .lo.pounds, and
I know that Postum is what keeps both
of them so healthy.
"I think all people who have dyspep-
sia get it from coffee drinking.

they -produced -affidavits and all sorts of
evidence that would be likely to carry

brought by several Chinese to restrain
the Board of Health from continuing the
quarantine In Chinatown, from preventing
the surgeons employed by the Six Compa

of identifying him."
"The burden of proof is on the Board of
Health," said Judge de Haven. "Has the
board any evidence to rebut the affi
davits?"
"We have not," replied Mr. Weller.'
"The petitioner is released," said the
Judge. "Adjourn court until 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
Judge de Haven said further that the
Board of Health had no right to restrict
the liberty of any person who had not
come into direct contact with the plague,
no matter what district of "the city he
came from. He left with his auditors
the impression that he would release any
Chinese or white person from -the so
called infected district unless it could be

The North Central Improvement Asso
ciation filed a petition with the Board of
Supervisors yesterday urging immediate
acceptance of the Hall of Justice building
and protesting strongly against any fur
â¢-ther delays. The communication says:
In reference to the acceptance by the city of
the Hall of Justice we respectfully call your
attention to the fact that at a recent meeting
of the Committee on Public Buildings the City
and County Attorney stated that the building
can legally be accepted at the present tlmÂ«
and the claims adjudicatM later. It was also
urged by the Auditor that the bulldtnsr be
Immediately accepted and the claims adjudi
cated later. "We respectfully call your attention
to the fact that over *275,00O has been expended
in the construction and furnishing of this
building which at the present date Is ready
for occupancy to all Intents and purposes. It
is not only a hardship upon the property owners
In the vicinity, but It is a ridiculous position
for the city to occupy â that is. to expend this
vast sum of money for the construction of the
bulldlne and then not to occupy it when it ia
completed.
Another communication from the asso
ciation 'opposes the petition now before
the board to allow the criminal depart
ments of -the Superior Courts to remain
In their present quarters at the City Hall.
It Is as follows:
We â¢wish to earnestly protest against any
action to be taken by your honorable board
to prevent the occupation of the Hall of Justice
by all of the criminal courts previously desig
nated to occupy the building. At a great ex
pense to the city and county the Hall of Jus
tice has been fitted up for its occupation by
these criminal courts, and to pay the Wast it
Is very late In the day for any objection to
be made to such occupancy, and we respectfully
hold that the petition en .file to that effect
should receive no consideration by your hon
orable board.

CHINESE REJOICE OVER DECISION.
to poison the Chinese, and an excited mob
repaired at once to the offices of the Six
Companies to make complaint. It was
Â¦with some difficulty that they were con
vinced that the discolored meat would
have no bad effects upon them.
Another small-sized riot occurred during
the afternoon on Sacramento street. A
mob of 250 Chinese gave a man who was
posting bulletins concerning Judg-c de
Haven's order a rough handling, but they
did no particular harm. Last night
t'hinatown was quiet. Judge de Haven's
decision had the effect of giving the Chi
nese conlidence that their attorneys
would pull them through without further
trouble, and they were willing to await
the outcome of the case that will come
before the court to-day. They are cer
tain the court will give the order to raise
the odious quarantine. â¢
The Board of Health still Is skirmish
ins for something upon which to continue
the quarantine. Bacteriologists Kellogg
and Breyfogle reported to the board yes
tt-rday a suspicious case at 21 Stone street,
which they diaRnosed as "plague-pneumo
nia." What "plague-pneumonia" may be,
however, has not been explained.
IMstrict Court Proceedings.
United States District Judge de Haven
made short work of the plague fakers in
the matter of the habeas corpus petition
of Chun Ah Sing, the cook, who alleged
that he had gone Into Chinatown on May
29 one hour prior to the quarantine, and
had been connned within the quarantine
limits ever since. J. J. Dunne appeared
In the morning for the Health Board, and
when the court asked for the "corpus"
that was to be "habeased," Mr. Dunne
Teplied that owing to the fact that the
population of Chinatown was between
2U,UOO and 25,000 the board had not had any
opportunity of making his acquaintance
and were unable to produce him.
Messrs. Campbell, Shortrldge, Ferral,
Kehoe and Bennett, attorneys for the
petitioner, agreed to furnish the board
with the address of the cook so that they
might be able to make the proper return
to the writ. The court took a recess until
2 o'clock in the afternoon, the Judge re
marking at the same time that he did
not propose to go into the whole matter
of the quarantine: that the case was an
application on habeas corpus, and that if
the averments of the petition with regard
to the petitioner were proved he would
discharge the cook.
At 2 o'clock the cook was in court with
abo'it 100 of his countrymen. Mr. Camp
bell proceeded to read his demurrer to the
return of the Health Board, but the court
cut him short for the purpose of saving
time The counsel then introduced an
affidavit from Mrs. Annie Davis of 733
Bush street to the effect that Chun Ah
Sing was her cook and that he lived in
her house. He went on May 29 to vtBit a
friend In Chinatown and was caught in
the quarantine. Sing's affidavit followed.
He swore that he did not see a dead per
son during the whole 'of ,the time of his
confinement, nor did he s*e a sick per.Â«on,
and he was not sick himself.
"How do we know," asked Charles L.
Weller. "that this Is the man for whom
Two brothers who had not seen each
other for twenty years previously met yes
terday afternoon in the Uroadway Jail.
One of them had boen arrested for swear
ing falsely to a pension paper and the
other had been brought here as a witness
by the Government to testify against the
prisoner. The meeting was mingled with
humor and pathos, but the latter became
paramount when the brother accused of
crime resolved to plead guilty and taku
the consequences, rather than hear u:n
words that would condemn him spoken by
one of his own kin in the witness stand.
Peter Morgan Ashley Smith-Crane, who
resides on the Round Valley Indian reser
vation and whose wife is an Indian, was
brought to this city by a deputy Marshal
yesterday. His brother, also going by the
name of Smitli-Cracc, was a veteran of
the civil war and it was alleged that the
man under arrest signed papers declaring
that he was his brother, in order to se
cure the pension which was coming to the
veteran. The Federal authorities located
the person entitled by law to the pension
in Belleville, Illinois, and he was brought
here under subpena,
Yesterday a meeting was arranged be
tv.'een the two. When they came face to
face In the office of the jail it Â¦was the
Jirst time they had seen each other since
tiny parted on the old farm in Illinois.
The man under arrest believed hi? brother
dead and the cross-examination he
eubjecic-d him to before he shook his
hand was one of the humorous features
of the affair. After Peter had Fettled the
fact as to his brothers identity both wept
and discussed the case.
"It'e a. lonf; time since I've seen you,"
i?aid the veteran, "but If you've done
wrorg stand up and take your medicine
like a man. Go to prison, brace up, and
when you get out I'll take you back to
the old farm to live with me."
Peter objected to going back to the old.
farm, as he had a wife and family to sup
port on the Indian reservation, but he
concluded that his brother's view of the
situation wrus thr- correct one and agreea
to accept it. The thoupht that his own
brother would be forced to deliver testi
mony against him wounded him more
than anything else and he concluded not
lo make any legal contest.
"I don't believe 1 ousrht to be turned
loose." he said. "I ought to gret bumped
a little. It would U-ach me some sense.
I've got to work anyway, and I mipht as
well try a hand in San Quentin as not.
The only thing I want Is a gTeat big hay
field and a. pitchfork and I will be con
tented."

JUDGE DE HAVEN of the United
States District Court practically de
cided yesterday that unless a per
son, whether Asiatic or American,
had come In direct contact with the
plague he could not be legally detained
within the quarantine lines drawn about
Chinatown. This decision will probably
have the effect of putting an end to the
quarantine of the district and will force
the Board of Health to abandon its plan
to keep the quarantine for another ten
days. Attorneys who have been employed
to bring habeas corpus proceedings for
the release of certain Chinese detained
within the lines are resting on their oars,
expecting the quarantine to be lifted be
fore they can act.
Yesterday another riot was nearly pre
cipitated in Chinatown by the accidental
discovery that the sulphur fumes from
the disinfected sewers had escaped Into
some of the markets in the district and
had impregnated the meats offered for
sale there. A cook had placed a silver
coin on a piece of meat and the coin had
turned black. Immediately the cry was
raised that the whites were attempting

With remarkable rapidity the flames
spread to a large structure In the rear of
the paint shop which is occupied as a

the stable wrre a number of valuable
horses and it was with considerable dlf-
Ilculty that they were saved from being
burned to death. Several streams were
rapidly brought to bear on the burning
structure and In a short time the flames
were extinguished.
How the nre started Is a mystery to
Chief SuUivan and his men. It is thought,
however, that the blaze was caused by
coinbustibles in the paint shop.

Paul was thrown from his seat, and
when picked up by Police Officer Dono

he was In a semi-conscious condition.
He recovered in a short time, however,

That several of the passengers were not

passengers stood on the front platform.
Among them were Police Officers "Jack"
