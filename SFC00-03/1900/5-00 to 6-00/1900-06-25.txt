Messenger of St. Petersburg published a
communication yesterday reviewing the
course of events in China and concluding
as follows:
"It will thus be seen that the Russian

China. On the contrary. In view of the

The St. Petersburg correspondent of the

the views of, the Russian , Foreign Office,
prepared by permission of. the late Count
Muravieff and embodying not only his
views, i but those of his successor.' Count
Lamsdorff. This statement holds that a
stater of war does not exist under Interna

that the order for active i military opera
tions at Taku originated with the pro
vincial authorities, and not with the Im
perial Government at Peking:.

Shanghai is quiet, but there are fears of
a rising. The action of the Consuls in
asking for the departure of the six
Chinese cruisers was objected to by the
senior naval officer, who informed them
that he had at its disposal a force suf
ficient to compel them to leave if they ob
jected to the presence of the fleet. The
Chinese cruisers are armed more heavily
than the vessels of the allies, among
whose six vessels is the United States

A Chefu dispatch to the Daily Mail, dat
ed yesterday, says: "The attack on the
Tientsin relief force was made by 20,000
Chinese using machine guns and mod
ern field places. The allies , were wise in
retreating. Forwarding detachments in
this manner Is suicidal and the defeats
of the foreigners, even though In small

Boxers, which is gaining enormously
through the inability of the foreigners to

Wish to Avoid War.
It will be two weeks before LI Hune
Chang can reach Peking, and it is pointed
out that as the foreign troops in largo
numbers are nowjm their way there the
situation would * be ' much complicat
ed if there should be more fighting, and
there would be increased opportunity for
riots. The Viceroys and Governors are
confident that the Imperial Government
has no intention of breaking friendly re
lations, as none of them have received
any war decrees. The cablegram ex
presses the earnest hope that the United
States will confer with other powers
with a view to having combined Instruc
tions sent to the commanders of all the
foreign troops now in China, directing
them to abstain from further hostile ac
tion until Li Hung Chang has had tlma
to reach Peking, when, it is predicted, he
will receeive imperial instructions to en
ter into negotiations with the representa
tives of foreign powers for the purpose of
bringing about a peaceful settlement of
the present difficulties, after which. It
is promised, imperial troops will with un
divided energy suppress the rioters.
It is further stated that, as the Vice
roys and Governors of Yangtse and the
coast provinces have assumed the re
sponsiblity and are exerting themselves
to the utmost for the protection of lffe
and property, foreigners need feel no
anxiety; but it is pointed out if
there should be more fighting about
Tientsin it would follow that Southern
China also would become Involved.
In conclusion, the cablegram says thÂ©
situation is critical, and it is urgent that
there should be prompt issuance of In
structions to foreign troops.

from further military operations
until Li Hung Chang has had time
to reach Peking and confer with the Dow
ager Empress and Emperor with a view
to bringing 'about a settlement of the
present troubles and averting the calam
ity of war.
This appeal did not come from the
Tsung H Yamen or from any authority
in Peking, but it is in the form of a cable
gram to Minister Wu Ting Fang from
Chang Chih Tung-, Viceroy of Hunan
and Hupeh provinces, with the concur
rence of all the Viceroys and Governors
of the Yangtse and coast provinces, who,
according to the cablegram, have as
sumed responsibility for doing all in their
power to protect foreigners. Similar
cablegrams have been sent to all the pow
ers.
The cablegram to Mlniser Wu is dated
at Wu Chang. June 23. It says that the
"Boxer" rioters. In disobedience of im
perial edicts, have been Inflicting injury
and loss of life and property upon people
of various nations In the north of China,
and that In Peking and In the surround
ing country Chinese subjects have lost
property of great value. The killing of
attaches of the Japanese Legation is re
ferred to as having been unforeseen by
the Imperial authorities and due to lack
of proper action by Chinese officials; but
the fear is expressed that the consequent
action of the foreign naval forces in
seizing Taku forts may lead to a rup

CHINA ALREADY
SEEKING PEACE
LONDON, June 25. 3 a. m.â The posi
tion cf the international forces in
the section of Northern China,
where 10X) men are striving to keep
a footing and to succnr the lega
tions in Peking, appears to increase
In peril with every fresh dispatch. Peking
has not been heard from direct for four
teen, days. The last dispatch was one im
ploring aid. Admiral Seymour's column
of 2000 was last heard from twelve days
ago. At the time it was surrounded mid
way between Peking and Tientsin. Possi
bly" now it has reached Peking.
The 3000 internationals at Tientsin Â¦were
hard pressed and fighting for their lives
on Thursday, and a relieving force of less
than 1000 men had been beaten back to
Taku on Friday. Observers on the spot
think that 100,000 men would not be too
many to grasp China firmly.
The Admiralty has received the follow
ing from the British rear admiral at Taku:
"CHEFU. June 3.â Only one runner has
got through from Tientsin for five days.
No information could be obtained except
that the foreign settlement had been al
most entirely destroyed and that our peo
ple were fighting hard. News is received
as this telegram is dispatched that an at
tempt to relieve Tientsin on June 23 was
repulsed with some loss."
The telegram also said: "The allied ad
mirals are working In perfect accord, with
the Russian vice admiral as senior of
ficer."
Defeat of the Allied Forces.
A press message from Shanghai dated
yesterday at 4 p. m. embodies some later
information. It Bays:
â¢"OfTlciaJ Japanese telegrams confirm the
reports of a defeat of the allied forces at
Tientsin. The foreigners there are now
placed in a most desperate situation. The
Russian admiral, Hillebrad, yesterday

of the force consisted of Japanese. The
remalnder was made up of contingents
representing the other nations.
"The guns of the Chinese around Tien
tsin are superior to anything the defend
ing European force has or is likely to have
for some time. The bombardment of Tien
tsin continued Friday. Bombsheds were
hastily erected by the foreign troops, con
structed of wetted piece goods. The food
supply is insufficient and the continued
shelling is reported to be telling terribly.
"Among those killed of the relief force
Friday was the commander of H. M. S.
Burfleur. The foreign casualties were 300.
"Japan is making every effort. Her
troops are now arriving at Taku in large
numbers. The Chinese troops in the prov
ince of ChirLl include 60,000 auxiliaries
who have been drilled by Russian and
German officers."
Captain Beatty and Lieutenant Wright,
British, have been severely wounded at
Tientsin, according to a Shanghai dis
patch to the Daily Express dated Satur
day. The information was brought there
by the British cruiser Orlando from Che
fu. The losses of the Russians have been
heavy.
Thousands of Chinese Slain.
It was reported from Shanghai last
evening that the allied forces had blown
up the Taku forts and that every avail
able man had been sent to the relief of
Tientsin. Two thousand three hundred
Chinese bodies are alleged to have been
cremated at Taku, and more than 4000
Chinese are said to have been killed at
Tientsin.
Chinese runners who have arrived at
Taku report that a foreign force was
engaged several days ago with an over
whelming body of Chinese forty miles
west of Tientsin. At Shanghai it is as
sumed that this force was Admiral Sey
mour's. The Shanghai correspondent of
the Daily Express says:

DIRE PERIL OF
RELIEF FORCE
June 24. â The Secretary of the Navy
has ordered Admiral Remey with the Brook'lyn to go to
Taku and assist the army with what, troops the Brooklyn
can carry.
Admiral Kempft's dispatch giving the first definite news of
the shedding of American blood on Chinese soil came early this
morning and was turned over to Secretary Long as soon as he
arrived at the department. With Admiral Crowninshield. the
Secretary carried the dispatch to the White House, where, on
the President's return from church, it was laid before him. The
determination thereupon was reached to order Admiral Remey,
in command of the Asiatic shuadron. from Manila to Taku on
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 24.â The Navy Department'
to-day gives out this bulletin :
"This telegram from Admiral Kempff, dated Che
fu.June 24, says: *In ambuscade near Tientsin on the 21st,
four of Waller's command killed and seven wounded. Names
will be furnished as soon as received. Force of 2000 going
to relieve Tientsin to-day. KEMP1-F.' "
The big ship may now T have a chance to repeat her cele
brated performance "around the Horn," as she is being crowded
for a fast run to the scene of action. The distance is about 1500
miles, and if she makes her record time she will be at Taku in six
days, about the same time that the Brooklyn arrives from Ma
nila. These ships are the only ones going to China. Admiral
Crowninshield pronounces as untrue the report that the gun
boats Marietta, Princeton and several other ships at Manila have
been ordered to Taku. There is felt to be no need for them, and,
moreover, with the ships now under orders to sail, Admiral Re
mey will have a force which is considered able to meet any pos
sible requirement.
board of the armored cruiser Brooklyn. The Secretary and Admiral Crowninshield returned to the Navy Depart
ment, where the necessary orders were dispatched to Admiral Remey. The effect of this transfer is to make Taku
the headquarters of the Asiatic squadron. The Brooklyn is expected to sail at onceâ to-day if possibleâ as the
orders sent contemplate getting the admiral on the scene at the earliest moment.
The advantage of this; it was officially stated, was not so much in adding the strength of the Brooklyn to
the fleet already there, as the fleet is considered by Secretary Long to be quite adequate, as it is in allowing the
authorities here to deal directly with the situation in China, instead of through the circuitous communications by
way of Manila. If the Brooklyn started to-day, as expected, it will take her fully a week to reach Taku, as the
trip is 2000 miles and typhoons are raging. The determination to carry some of General MacArthur's troops on
a flagship was the emergency of the situation. The troops are believed to be reacly to move, but some delay may
be caused in getting on board sufficient supplies for a large body of men for a week.
Admiral Kemptt's report that four Americans' were killed and seven wounded in the ambuscade of Waller's
force caused the gravest concern among officials, but the chief fear was as to the outcome of the second attack,
which, the admiral reported, would begin to-day. Its results may be decisive, not only to the immediate force em
ployed but in determining the fate of legations and foreign settlements at Tientsin, and also whether the issue is
or is not to be war with China.
Word reached the Navy Department to-day that the battleship Oregon got away from Hongkong last, night
bound for Taku. This is two days ahead of her expected start. She took on 164 sailors and marines, brought
to Hongkong bv the Zafiro.
The war branch of the Government is preparing for any eventuality that may arise out of the Chi
nese situation. It was stated by one of the highest officers of the army that the scale of preparation is of a mag
nitude which would both interest and surprise the public. But, he added, the information would be of even greater
interest and service to any foreign foe which the United States, may be called upon to face within the next few
weeks or months, and for that reason there is no purpose to make public the full preparations making to meet
whatever issue arises. All that the officials will say is that both the army and the navy, if the occasion arise, will
give a good account of themselves.
Adjutant General Corbin was at his desk during the morning, and after going over the dispatches went to
the White House. The President was about to start for church, so that there was time for only a brief consul
tation. General Corbin said nothing had been received up to that hour from MacArthur as to the Philippines or
the Chinese. As to the preparations for China, General Corbin refused to say anything except that the report of
a brigade being ordered there was purely speculative.
While the Berlin reports as to the safety of Baron von Ketteler and the legations at Peking appear to dispose
of one of the most alarming stories of the crisis, Minister Conger at Peking is still cut off from communication
there, and there is no direct and official assurance of the safety of the Ministers and legations, nor is there a
word of the relief force, including the Americans who sought to break through to Peking.
Secretary Long returned from an outing at Pingha last night and to-day resumed charge of affairs, relieving
Assistant Secretary Hackett. The Secretary- looked greatly refreshed. About the first news that reached him
on his arrival was the fighting and bloodshed of the American marine forces near Tientsin.

MUSTARD IN MONTEREY. ,
Farmers Are Attempting to Revive
an Old Industry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MONTEREY. June 24.â A new industry,
mustard .culture, is being tried in the
farming sections of this county this year
and the crops are already very promis
ing. K. M. Henniken. the large beekeeper
of Carmel, is going Into the new "business
more extensively than anv one else and
has a large tract of land sown to mus
tard. There are about a dozen other
ranchers trying the experiment, chiefly tn
the Canada Segunda. Carmel and Coast
districts, and a yield of over seventy tona
of mustard seed is expected.
In early days mustard culture was one
of the leading Industries hereabouts, but
of late years nothing: at all in that line
has been tried. It is believed mustard
can now be made a very lucrative crop
if properly handled by the ranchers, as
climatic conditions here are so favorable
to its growth, and if the present experi
ment proves successful it will doubtless
become a permanent industry in Monterey
County.

MESSAGE OF
M'ARTHUR TO
THE FILIPINOS
Special Dispatch to The Call
OMAHA, Xebr., June 24.â Partisans of
W. J. Bryan strongly intimate that his
trip to Wisconsin was arranged that he
might have a conference with Nominee
Towne, and they say that the Vice Presi
dential Question is disturbing: Mr. Bryan
and his associates far more than is the
platform to be adopted at Kansas City.
Democrats who are nearest to Bryan con
tend' that a mistake was made when
Towne was nominated,. while leadlnsr Pop
ulists, who represent Bryan, declare that
whatever the action . of the Kansas City
convention may be, Towne's name shall
remain on the national ticket. The situ
ation is almost identical with that' of 1B96.
Discussing the subject editorially, the
Omaha Bee shows that Bryan Is not
averse to a double-header second place
ticket. The Bee will say:
In his book reviewing 1 the last Presidential
campaign, written shortly after its close, Will
iam Jennings Bryan, referring to the "npp* 1 
cedpnteÂ«l anomaly of a Presidential ticket with
two camlidatea for the Vice Presidency, gays:
"Looking buck over the campaign I am now
convinced that under the conditions then ex
isting two Vice Presidential candidates were
better than one and that, notwithstanding the
embarrassment at the time, the silver cause
made a better showing than It would have
done if Mr. Sewall had withdrawn in favor of
Mr. Watson or Mr. Watson in favor at Mr.
'Vhls' unqualified indorsement of the two
tailed system prompts the question. Mr. Bryan
wants two running; mates again in the cam
paUn' of l?00. So far Mr. Bryan seems to be
the only man upon whom all fusion tickets
unite, while to force a Democrat for Vice,
President on the Popul'sts- or a Populist on
thÂ« Democrats ec-enis to threaten as ereat dis
sension now an it did four years ago. Would
not the withdrawal of Mr. Towne in favor of
the choice of the Kansas City convention alien
ate as many Democrats as would have been
driven away" by the substitution of Watson for
Bewail in the last campaign? The Populists
and Sliver Republicans are preparing to make
a biK demonstration in favor of Towne at
Kansas City July 4.
TOWNE'S ASPIRATIONS.
Hopes to Get the Nomination at

DULUTH, Minn., June 24. â Charles A.
Towne takes exception to the inference
drawn In a dispatch from Austin, Tex.,
yesterday that he would withdraw from
the Vice" Presidential race If not nomi
nated at Kansas City. The dispatch
quoted an extract from a letter written
by Mr Towne to Major Walton of Austin.
Mr. Towne said to-night that there was
nothing in the letter upon which an Inti
mation of his course as to the Vice Pres
idency could be based.
â¢â¢You may say, however," continued Mr.
Towne, â¢â¢that I expect to be nominated
for Vice President at Kansas City, and
I have more support at present for the
nomination than any other man, although
in some sections of the East there seems
to be objection to a Western man for the
Clace. Jf. however, I am not nominated

prepared to pay what action I shall take

James Fitzsimmons. fatally injured Jo
seph Drake, seriously and probably fatal
ly injured Mrs. James Fitzsimmons,
slightly injured Miss Kate Fitzsimmons
and then ended his own life.
Mefford, who was 27 years old, came
here from an asylum two years ago and
had never been returned. Late Saturday
night he became wild and darted out of
his home, a raving maniac. Â¦ The police
tried unsuccessfully to find him.
Shortly before 5 o'clock this morning
Reginald Andrews, the janitor at the Old
Ladies' Home, was awakened by crashing
glass. The next moment Mefford stood
before him stark naked, swinging a'neCk
yoke.
"I have murdered a whole family to
r.Igrht and I am going to kill you next and
then everybody in the home," exclaimed
Mefford. With this he attempted to
brain . Andrews. The latter choked him
into submission. Rushing through the
house Andrews locked the old ladies in
their rooms, notified the police and ran
across the street to the home of James
Drake for assistance. As Andrews and
Drake emerged a few moments later Mef
ford, carrying an axe, was seen to plunge
through a window in the home of James
Fitzfcimmons. near by. As be entered the
room Mrs. Fitzsimmons uttered a scream.
Mefford swung the axe and brought it
down toward her head. Her uplifted arm
saved her life. The arm was broken in
two places and she sustained a serious
scalp wound.
Mr. Fitzsimmons dashed into the room
and grappled with the maniac. Mefford
shook him off and split his skull with' a
blow of the ax. Then, dashing up stairs,
Mefford attacked Miss Kate Fitzsimmons,
Inflicting a number of severe scalp
wounds.
When Mefford came down stairs he en
countered Drake, struck him on. the head
with the ax and taking Drake's revolver
ran out of the house. After running -sev
eral blocks he put a bullet into his left
breast Just below the heart. Running on
two or three blocks further, he sat down
on the curbstone. Placing the revolver to
the center of his forehead he llred again.
He continued to wave the pistol above his
head. But as the first officer grabbed the
revolver from behind Mefford fell over
into the gutter dead.

VICTORIA. B. C. June 24.-On Satur
day, June 16, residents of Skaguay met
and drafted a petition praying for incor
poration, according to news received by
the steamer Amur, which arrived this
afternoon. The petition sets forth that
Skaguay was founded in 1897, that its pop
ulation is 3500, Its area two miles long
and three-quarters of a mile wide, and
that It contains 1000 buildings.
Another link against O'Brien, the man
held for the Claysoh -murder, has been
formed by the discovery of another body,
that of Lynn Relfe of Seattle; by the po
lice. The body was found on a bar not
far from where that of Clayson was dis
covered. Its identification was complete.
There were two bullet holes through the
body and one through the head. It was
sent to Dawson.
The Klondikers who arrived by the
Amur came up the river by the steamers
Gold Star and Yukoner, which occupied
twenty days In getting up the river, be
ing continually aground. They brought
out over ?170,000. Advices brought by
them were to the effect that the river
and lakes were rising, and in ten days
it was expected th^ bigger vessels would
again be able to navigate the river. They
report that several scows were wrecked,
one, belonging to Henry Macaulay, caus
ing the loss of freight valued at several
thousands of dollars.
Jim Hansen, the Indian accused of the
murder of the Hortons. has been found
guilty of murder in the first degree at
Skaguay. He was not sentenced, but the
general impression is that he will be
hanged. Many say that trouble Is likely
to be caused among the Indians if he suf
fers the death penalty.
A big quartz discovery is reported from
the Ohilcoot trail. Thirty men were
placed at work to uncover the vein.
The steamers Nora and Olive May of
the Klondike Corporation are to run the
White Horse rapids and be placed In
service on the lower river.

Special DiFpatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. June 24.â When the steamer
Tartar, which arrived yesterday after
noon, left Yokohama on June 8 the Boxer
; rising- in North China ha<l already as
j Â»un?ed serious proportions. Atrocities had
i been committed by the Bcxer hordes,
! many foreigners had been killed and much
i property destroyed. The missionaries and
j Chinese who had Joined the following of
the foreign cvcngelists wero thoso who
gave the most victims to the fanatical
Boxers as they marched on through Chl-
Li and Shantung toward Peking, burning,
looting and killing as they went along.
The villages in the neighborhood of Pao-
Ting Fu were the first to go down in the
atmosphere of the riot, loot and blood
shed. This was at the end of May. At
Loasui'-g. not far from the central city of
Chi-LI, there was a massacre, the village
being practically wiped "out by the Box
ers. Seventy-three of the villagers who
were known to have been converts of the
Roman Catholic mission were slain with
horrible cruelties, fingers, toes and other
portions of their body being cut off and
the unfortunates sliced with knives and
stabbed about the body with ironshod
potes while they were yet alive.
There were also massacres ar Kaolo,
thirty miles from the town of Tsinghsien
and at another place ten miles from Tang
Â«=hu. In the latter village sixty Chris
tian? met death at the hands of the Box
ers. They were holding service in the
village chapel when the Boxers marched
Into the vfilare and were killed as they
tried to escape when the building had
been fired by the rebels.
At the massacre at the village near
Tangshu the Christians were slain in their
burning church. The Christians had been
trapped in the church while holding ser
vice by an advance guard of the rebels.
The doors were barricaded before they
knew that they were trapped. None had
arms and to think of fighting was out of
the question. There was nothing but
flight. If a way of escape could be found,
but all exits had been closed and the un
fortunates were herded back into the
flames until there was nothing left but
their charred bodies lying in the embers
of the church.
It was the day before the first contin
gent landed that the station at Fungtal
was burned with the railway workshops.
A number of the engineers and workmen
tried to defend the shops, but they were
compelled to retreat in order to save their
lives. The Belgian. American and British
employes of the line, according to the
story telegraphed to Japanese papers,
formed a hollow square around their wo
men and children, and. armed as they
were with rifles, fought a running Sght
with the Boxers until they arrived in thÂ©
vicinity of Tientsin. Several were killed,
some of the Japanese papers giving the
number as fifteen. .

LODGE SAYS WE MUST
ACT AS WORLD POWER
Special Dispatch to The C&U.
BOSTON, June 24.â Senator Lodge, who
returned from the Philadelphia conven
tion with augmented prestige as an ex
pounder of Republican policy, is out with
a vigorous statement urging the duty of
the United States Government to take an
active Interest in the adjustment of af
fairs in China. Senator Lodge's state
ment is regarded by the politicians of the
East as outlining in some measure the
purposes of the administration with re
spect to the issues that have newly arisen
in the Far East. Senator Lodge says in
his public statement:
We have China on th<r far western sphere of
the Pacific, but we hold the other side. The
peopl* who live on the furtherest shore of the
Pacific cannot bÂ« a matter of indifference to
the masters of the western coast of North
Study that Chinese question. It is the great
question of the day. The events that are go
ing on to-day In China are bis with future re
sults. All the great nations of the world are
gathered there. One great nation Is planning
to selre that empire and close it to the rest of
the world. That In our own Interests, and In
the interests of humanity, and the interests of
civilization, too, we cannot afford.
I am not afraid ever to see the United States
&.ke her" place In the struggle of the great
world powers, where shÂ« belongs. I do not
mean that I want her to meddle In Europe.
God forbid! Eut I do say that the other side
of the Pacific is an American interest, and I
want to Â«ee the United States protect her own
throughout the East.
She can do it. We are no weakllne. The
blood of youth Is in our veins, and we shall
triumph over these difficulties as we have tri
umphed over greater ones in the past
BARRETT SAYS *CHINA
SHOULD REMAIN INTACT
CINCINNATI. June 24.â Hon. John Bar
rett, ex-Minister to Slam, was here to
day. Before leaving for Cleveland he
said:
"In restoring peace in China the United
States should be the principal influence
to determine the future and fate of
China. . It is America's Influence only that
can successfully relieve this problem and
keep China from an impending break-up.
America must stand for the integrity^ of
the Chinese empire, for "we have every
thing to lose and nothing to gain by her
partition among the European powers.
"Oh, if America allows China to be di
vided, the expansion of our commerce and
the extent of our moral influence will be
absolutely limited by the attitude and
policy of European nations.
"Another point is this: The United
States is the only power whose leadership
and dictation of policy Russia would ac
cept." : ' Â¦

Fond du Lac and was packed with people
from that city, Oshkosh and Neenah. The
first two coaches of the passenger train
were telescoped and demolished, few of
the passengers escaping injury. Some
were killed outright, others were terribly
mangled. Others were badly crushed and
maimed â all hemmed in amidst the debris
of the wrecked car. The scene was ap
palling and the cries of the injured heart
rending. The passengers poured out of
the rear coaches and . it -riras but a mo
ment before hundreds of willing workers
were busy extricating the unfortunates.
Some of the injured were only just alive
when they were taken out and they died
before they could be removed.
The greatest excitement prevailed among
the panic-stricken excursionists. Those
unhurt began a wild scramble for their
missing friends and for a few moments
everything was confusion. Women and
children were crying and the many in
jured pinned in the wreckage were beg
ging to be helped.
The bodies of Charles Mierza of Osh
kosh and Edward Koske of Fond du Lac
vrcre horribly crushed and could scarcely
be recognized. /
The cause of the accident, so tat as has
been determined at this time, was due
to the freight crew Tallin? to give the pas
senger the right of way.

The British Admiralty has ordered five
more cruisers to go to China. This rep
resents an additional 50,000 tons, the crews
aggregating 3000.
The Shanghai correspondent of the
Tlmf-s says: "Sheng, Director of Tele
graphs, declares that the information was
received to-day (Friday, June 22) to the
effect that the foreigners in Peking were
safe on Wednesday, June 20, but that all
the legations had been burned except the
British. Austrian and Belgian."
A dispatch from Shanghai dated yester
day says: "Sheng says he has news from
Peking by courier to Shantung that the
foreign Minister? at Peking are demand,
ing their passports, and that the Tsung U
Yamen is disposed to comply with their
requests."
If this news be true It would imply the
correctness of the reports of the arrival of
Admiral Seymour at Peking.
According to a dispatch to the Times
from Simla, dated yesterday, the Indian
force going to China will be Increased to a
division.
The Times, reviewing the situation to
day editorially, says: ;
"There is no whisper in favor of the pafr
tition or spoliation of China in this coun
try or in the ITnited Statc-s, but we feel
very strongly that the time has come for
the introduction of those practical reforms
which Mr. Choate in his recent letter to
Lord Salisbury declared to be desirable."

The storm did not abate in fury. Flashes
of lightning added to the steady glow of
the burning train and lighted up the scene
with fearful distinctness.
Flagman Quinlan, who was one of the
first to get out, at once started for the
nearest telegraph station. Making his
way as rapidly as possible in the face of
the blinding storm, he stumbled into the
office at MeDonough. and after telling the
night operator of the wreck;. fell fainting
to the floor. Word v/as quickly sent to
both, Atlanta and Macon, but no assist

ATLANTA. Ga. June- 24.â The pas
senger train on the Macon branch
of the Southern Railyay, which ran
into a washout one and a half miles
north of MeDonough. Ga.. . last
night, was completely wrecked. The
wreck, caught fire and the entire train,
with the exception of the sleeper, was de
stroyed. Every person on the train, ex
cept the occupants of the Pullman car,
perished. Not a member of the train crew
eEcaped. Thirty-five persons in all were
killed.
The train left Macon at 7:10 and was
due In Atlanta at 9:40 last night. MeDon
ough was reached on time. At this point
connection is made for, Columbus. Ga.,
and here every night the Columbus train
is coupled on and hauled through to At
lanta. Last night, however, for the first
time in many months tne Columbus train
was reported two hours late on account of
a washout on that branch, and the Macon
train started on to Atlanta without its
Columbus connection.
Tremendous rains of dally occurrence
for the past two weeks had swollen all
streams in all parts cf the South, and
several washouts have been reported on
the different roads. Camps Creek, which
runs into the Okmulgee, was over its
banks and its waters had spread to all
the lowlands through which it runs.
About a mile and a half north of MeDon
ough the creek comes somewhere- near the
Southern's tracks, and, running alongside
for some distance, finally passes away
under the road by a heavy stone culvert.
A cloudburst broke over that section of
the country about 6 o'clock last night and,
presumably shortly after dark, washed
out a section of the track nearly 100 feet
In length.
Plunges Into the Torrent.
Into this the swiftly moving >train
plunged. The storm was still rasrinjr and
all the car windows were closed. The
passengers, secure as they thought, and
sheltered comfortably from the inclement
weather, went to death without an in
stant's warning.
The train, consisting of a baggage car,
second-class coach, first-claps coach and a
Pullman sleeper, -was knocked into kind
ling wood by the fall. The wreck caught
fire in a few minutes and all the coaches
were burned except the Pullman car.
Every person on the train except the
occupants of the Pullman car perished in
the disaster. There was no escape, as the
heavy Pullman car weighted down the
others, and the few alive in the sleeper
were unable to render assistance to their
fellow-passengers.
For a brief time there was silence. Then
the occupants of the Pullman car recov
ered from the bewilderment, and, after
hard work, managed to get out of their
car and found themselves on the track in
the pouring rain. The extent of the catas
trophe was quickly apparent. Flames
were already seen coming from that part
of the wreck not covered by the water.
As the wreck began to go to pieces under
the destructive work of both flames and
flood human bodies floated out from the
mass and were carried down stream by
the swift current.
ough went to the scene to render assist
ance, but little could be done by the res
cuers, as the fire kept them at a distance.
At daylight the bodies that had floated
from the gorge were gathered up. One
body was found a mile from the wreck,
and many were seen along its banks.
A wrecking train was started out from
Atlanta at midnight, but owing to the
burning wreckage nothing could be done
until morning. A special train at 6
o'clock this morning took doctors, minis
ters, railroad officiate and helpers to the
ijecne, but nothing could be done save to
gather up the bodies. As the dead were
found they were removed to McDonough.
There are two undertakers there. Both
establishments were soon full of the man
gled remains of the passengers. Some of
the bodies were terribly burned, while
others were crushed beyond recognition.
The only means of iiJentlflcatlon in the
majority of the cases were letters and pa
pers in the pockets of the victims.
The bodies were prepared for burial as
rapidly as possible. Some may be burled
at McDonoush. Others will be sent to
their homes as fast as their proper ad
dresses can be ascertained.
Only thr^e women were on the train.
Two escaoed. It is presumed that the
ether perished, but the body has not been
found.
Besides the regular crew of the train
several conductors and other employes
were en route to Atlanta to spend Sun
day. All were killed. Conductor W. A.
Barclay was In charge of the train. A
section boss with a gang of fight negroes
occupied scats in the secortd-class coach.
They were on their way to repair a wash
out on the Georgia Midland and Oulf
road. Not one escaped when the car went
down.
Of the injured about thirty are in a
serious condition and severai may not
recover.
Death Gave No Warning.
John L. Rohr. a traveling salesman of
Baltimore, one cf the rescued, said:
"I was in the Pullman with the others
who escaped with their lives, when the
wreck occurred. There was not an in
stant's warning. We heard suddenly an
indistinct crash and the next instant felt
our car pitch forward and drop. The for
ward enu of the car filled wuh water at
once and the lights went out. We heard
the roar of rushing waters. We got down
on all fours. f*>lt our way and crawled to
the top of the car and then out. The car
was hanging by its rear trucks to the
stone abutment of the culvert and swayed
to and fro by the motion of theÂ»water. It
was pitch dark and the rain was coming
down in torrents. Not a single call for
help was heard. These in the forward
coaches must have met death instantly.
The wreckage was on tire when we
reached the ton of our car and lighted
the scene brightly,
"Looking down toward the middle of
our car I saw the head and shoulders of
a woman and soon heard her cry: "Save
us, we are alive'.' But- we could do noth
ing for her. Then came the struggle to
get to the track above. Great chunks of
earth loosened by the train came falling
down on us, and we were nearly buried
two or three times. Once Flynn, who
was one of our little party, got within
grasping distance of the top. Suddenly
he lost his hold and down he came. He
went into the river and was carried away
by the rush of waters. At daylight he
walked up to our party and told us he
had managed to catch a tree after swim
ming: a mile or more in the water."

THE VICE PRESIDENT.
THE first national convention held in this coun
try was really called to nominate a candidate for
Vice President to run with Jackson. The last
one was practically held for a like purpose. McKin
ley was renominated by consent, as Jackson was, and
no convention was needed for that purpose. The
Vice Presidency was the selection in controversy.
There was no politics in taking a Western man, for
say and sing it as often as may be. the President rep
sents the West and the nomination of either Fair
banks or Dolliver would have been resorting to the
same section for both candidates. It came to pass
that Mr. Irving M. Scott was mentioned for this
nomination, but without his procurement or consent.
The same sectional objection would have been against
him. The Republican party lias elected Lincoln and
Grant of Illinois, Hayes, Garfield and McKinley of
Ohio and Harrison of Indiana, all Western men. Its
Vice Presidential nominations have gone to Maine,
Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Indiana and
Tennessee. This constant selection of Western men
to head its ticke.ts has accounted in part for the loyal
adherence of the West to its principles and fortunes.
The convention was at no time under any- illusions
nor was it led by any emotional ideals. It adhered
to its policy. of c6mbining a Western and Eastern
man on the ticket, a policy which it has varied but
once, when it put Grant and Golfax -together -in. 1868.
This adherence. gave it no choice between first-class
men except Secretary Long and Governor Roosevelt.

THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
DURING the whole of this week, down to Satur
day evening, the work of enrolling members
of Republican clubs in the various Assembly
districts of the city will be carried on. After the en
rollment is closed time will be given for a hearing
of any complaints that may be filed concerning the
enrollment and on July 9 the clubs are expected to or
ganize by the election of officers. The clubs will
presumably nominate delegates to be voted for at the
primary election, and as such tickets will have "ad
vantage in the contest, it is the desire of the County
Committee to give every Republican voter in San
Francisco an opportunity to enroll himself in his dis
trict club, take part in its organization and have a
voice in nominating i-ny ticket it may put forth.
What ha-s been done is fair for all and were it not
fair it is too late to complain now. It rests with the
better class of Republicans to determine whether
they will join these clubs and control them, orwhether
they* will leave ward bosses and railroad touts to
gather into them the loafers of the bar-rooms and so
obtain within the party a point of vantage from which
they can do much damage in spite of all that may be
c'one to prevent.
This is the season of the year when many business
men leave the city for the holidays. Those who go
will be inclined to forget to attend to this political
duty before going, and those who remain will, in many
cases, have something of extra work to do because
of the absence of the pleasure-seekers, and they also
may be forgetful. Such being the case there is con
siderable danger the business men and the intelligent
workingmen of the party will not be so fully repre
sented in the district clubs as they should be. To
guard against that danger there is heeded something
like a canvass of the party by its-more active mem
bers for the purpose of getting enrolled every Repub
lican who will stand for honest politics and genuine
Republicanism against the bosses and their gangs;
It will not be much trouble for every earnest Re
publican to remind his friends during the week of the
importance of joining the district club. A simple re
minder of the duty will ,in most cases be all that is
necessary to attain the purpose. Men neglect their
political responsibilities chiefly because in the routine
of life they forget them. It is for that reason the pro
fessional ward heelers so frequently triumph over
business men and workingmen in doing politics. The
bosses never- fof get, nor do they let their "push", for- 1
get. They will join the district-clubs in large num
bers, they will get fraudulent enrollments if. they, can,
and for the welfare of the" party the better class of â¢Re
publicans must stand guard with vigilance and bÂ»
ready to act with ( energy.

PERSONAL MENTION.
ENTER THE FARMER.
IT seems to be almost the rule in the United States
that when the manufacturer flourishes the farmer
languishes, and vice versa. Or, to be more
specific; when the great farm staples are low manu
factured poods are bringing good prices with an ac
tive demand, and the reverse. Whenever the two di
visions of industry flourish together business booms
ir.deed, but the combination is not frequent.
Last year wheat was quiet and low and manufac
turers enjoyed more prosperity than for years; now,
when the factories are quiet throughout the country,
wheat suddenly wakes up and surprises everybody by
nsing at a great rate.
These are the two leading features of business at
the moment. The manufacturer is taking a back seat
and the farmer is having his innings. The rise in
wheat is 25 cents per bushel since last November and
20 cents during the past fortnight. The disaster to
the crop in the great spring wheat belt, through
which the crop in the two Dakotas and Minnesota
will probably be cut down from 200,000,000 bushels
in 1899 to a scant 75,000,000 in 1900, is the direct cause
of the advance, though within the past few
d2ys conditions in Russia are becoming less favorable
and the showing in the Argentine is not as good as it
has been. Predictions of $1 wheat by midsummer are
coming in from Chicago and already the quotation is
making a shadowy appearance in the horizon of the
California farmer. In any event, the advance is com
ing early enough to enable the farmer to get the
benefit of it, whereas the last rise did not occur un
til along in the fall and early winter when the grain
had generally passed out of the farmer's hands into
those of the middleman.
Already produce is showing the effects of the im
provement in wheat rnd flour, millstufls and minor
cereals are advancing in sympathy. An adverse ef
fect is the probable falling off in railroad earnings,
owing to the reduction of the crop.
Genera! trade continues dull. Cotton has shown
more strength of late, owing to crop damage, and
trade in summer dry goods has been helped by warm
weather, but wool and woolen goods are dull, and
hides, leather, boots and shoes are reported in an un
satisfactory condition almost everywhere. Lumber
is accumulating at some points and the general feel
ing is weaker. Iron and steel continue to decline,
mills are shutting down and furnaces going out of
blast and it is evident that this great industry has seen
its best days for some little time to come.
The financial condition of the country continues
sound. During the past few weeks New York has
accommodated Paris and Berlin with about $10,000.
000 in actual gold without any effect whatever on
rate's of interest or the general condition of the mar
ket. The failures during the past week were 167,
against 199 for the' same week last year. This is a
change from the recent tendency in these failures,
â¢which for some weeks had been showing an increase
over 1899. The bank clearings of the country last
week fell behind those of 1899 by 7.4 per cent, which
is not a jcrious decrease.
Conditions in California continue flattering. The
outlook here is better than in most of the Eastern
States. We are reaping ihe benefits of the advance
in wheat and the minor cereals and of the remark
able demand for our fruit, which is enabling us to
dispo^- of a very abundant crop at much better fig
ures than we expected a few weeks ago. Indeed, the
demand for fruit this year breaks the, record. In
spite of the heaviness of the crop it is actually scarce
here and there and the canners arc finding it neces
sary to advance their prices from time to time to ob
tain supplies. The shipments of deciduous fruit east
ward thus far this year amount to 725 cars, against 685
durin? the same time in 1800. and the record of citrus
Unit shipments up to the 19th inst was 16,232 cars.
? Inch is said to be in excess of all previous years. In
r.ddition the northern demand for California fruit has
increased surprisingly this year.
The Goliath, British battleship, left the
Nore on May 30 for China to relieve the
Victorious on that station. .
The unusual sight was recently wit
nessed on the streets of London of a sand
wich man who conspicuously called public
attention to extracts from Lord Beres
ford's speech condemning the British
navy. This somewhat sensational and un
dignified proceeding was engineered by the
Navy League.
A Dutch torpedo boat named, the Hydra,
built by Yarrow at Chiswick, made her
contract trial of three I ours on May 23
arjd developed a speed of 24.3 knots, ex
ceeding the contract by 1.3 knots. The
Hydra is 130 feet In length, 13.6. feet
breadth and six feet draught. She Is a
single screw boat.
The following Russian vessels en route
for China were reported on May 31 at
places indicated. Battleship Admiral
Nachimoff. S524 tons, at Speila: battle
ship Alexander II, 9927 tons, together with
torpedo boats 119 and 120, were at Corfu;
Zaporoyetz, gun vessel of 1224 tons, was at
Suda Bay. and the Khraby, armored gun
boat of 1432 tons, was at Toulon.
Public .'attention Is being directed in
Kngland â¢ to the apparent fact that the
Admiralty Is practically boycotting the
noted firm at Elswick. And yet the Arm
strong' company has built better ships for
foreign powers than the British Admiralty
has furnished for the home navy. The
modern ship-of-war originated In the
Armstrong yard, and it is therefore Just
possible that professional jealousy Is a
factor in the boycott.
The new British crufser Argonaut, 11,000
tons and twenty and three-fourths knots
speed, has been listed for some time as
being attached to the China squadron, but
she was still at the Portsmouth dockyard
two weeks ago owing to her inability to
pass the commission trials. The last trou
ble was "hot bearings." .ne trials include
twenty-four houra under 9000 horsepower,
three hours under full power and twenty
four hours under 3600, or one-fifth power.
The Italian firm of Orlando Bros, at
Leghorn has made good progress In ma
rine engineering. The cruiser Puglla, for
which they built the engines, developed
1000 horsepower more than the contract
called for. Under a six hours' natural
draught trial the horsepower averaged
4300, giving a speed of 17.6 knots, and un
der one and one-half hours' forced
draught the horsepower was 7500 with 19*4
knots speed.
The engineer corps In the French navy
is agitating for increased numbers, better
pay and improved status. Its position Is
rather an anomalous one: Its members
rise In rank by about a dozen successive
grades from the lowest to that of the high
est, and may become chief inspectors of
machinery. There are no warrant officers
in the French navy, arid until the en
gineer on board ship reaches the three
higher grades he ranks only with petty
officers.
Navy building is very active at St. Pe
tersburg, there being three battleships and
one -cruiser in various stages of progress
on the stocks. Of the battleships the
Borodino, 13.566 tons and eighteen knots,
was begun May 26 of last year; Alexander
III,, of 13,516 tons and eighteen knots, had
her keel laid September 5, 1S99, and the
Pobieda, 12,674 tons and eighteen knots,
was started August 1, 1S9S. The cruiser
Aurora, C63* tons and twenty knots, has
been on the stocks since October 31, 1SD6.
By a decree of May IS last the Queen of
Spain has ordered a number of naval ves
sels to be struck off the list, to be sold or
used as coal hulks, ficatlng ammunition
depots or as material for submarine de
fense, by which latter terra sinking is
probably meant. Among the vessels con
demned are the cruisers Alfonso XII and
Alfonso XIII, eight torpedo gunboats,
seven gunboats and four torpedo boats.
Five coast defense vessel's dating from the
early 'â¬0's are also condemned, and the
armorcladsâ so-calledâ Numancia and VI
toria are likewise slated for permanent re
tirement, whose boilers and machinery re
quire extensive repairs. The majority of.
the condemned vessels are old, but three
of the torpedo gunboats are only nine
years old and were rated at nineteen
knots. Alfonso XIII, a cruiser of 5000 tons,
was also built in 1S91 and had a speed'
when new of twenty knots. The Temera
rlo, which was to intercept the Oregon on
her voyage East, is likewise condemned,
although only eleven years old and had a
rating of twenty and a half knots speed.
The removal of comparatively modern
vessels indicates that they had been badly
cared for and became useless. This leaves
Spain with the merest nucleus of a navy,
and It has taken that country three hun
dred years to realize the folly of building
ships to be or destroyed by other
naval powers.

INDORSEMENTS
TO BLUSH FOR
A Jacksonian Democrat Points
Out an Instance of Poor
Party Policy.
Editor Call: I note your challenge to
Democrats on the Indorsement of Hearst
and the Examiner by the late convention
at Sacramento. For myself, as a life-long
Democrat, I regard both indorsements as
beneath the dignity of a great party, and
something to blush for. If the Examiner
had even been of substantial assistance
to tne party, which is not the case, to
pick it out for such a compliment is un
just in the extreme to the faithful Demo
cratic nress of this State. Distinctions of
that kind are invidious In the extreme and
are poor party policy.
As for Mr. Hearst himself, his "Xail
the-flag" cry and Indorsement of govern
ment of "dependencies" without constitu
tional limitations made the compliment to
him a distinct Indecency, which gains no
respectability by being suspected of
a leg-pulling motive, which will make
the young man pay for having his vanity
tickled.
If our leaders In this State can rise no
higher than this small business it Is no
wonder that we have such in luck.

When the Dawn comes up like Thunder
Out 'er China, 'crost the bay. â Kipling.
BY good fortune the organization of a new Grand
Jury is coincident with the emergency th'at calls
for the cleaning of Chinatown. By the disas
trous attempts at quarantine public attention has been
directed to the unsanitary condition of that quarter
of the city and public sentiment is unanimous in favor
of reform. It is therefore fortunate that at the very
time when, the people are aroused and in earnest on
the issue we have in the Grand Jury the new broom
needed to make a clean sweep.
This Grand Jury has an opportunity to prove the
usefulness of the institution. It has been the custom
for grand juries to make examinations of the various
departments of the county and city administration, to'
pass judgment either of approval or of condemnation as
to the manner in which official business is carried on,
to make complaints of this or that, to make recommen
dations more or less wise, and then to wind up with a
plea of excuse because little or nothing was accom
plished in the way of real reform. Of the present
Grand Jury we expect better things. At any rate it
has an opportunity to do something on a large scale
and to have abundant support- from the people in do
ing it. That opportunity arises from the fact that the
unsanitary condition of Chinatown is due to the per
sistent and flagrant violation of city health laws.
There is much work for the Grand Jury to do, but
this portion of the work should be taken up at once
and given precedence over everything that might con
flict with it or lead to its postponement. Let the jury
as a body, or by a strong committee, enter upon a
thorough investigation of Chinatown, not to look for
tinhorn gambling places, cheap bawdy houses or
other slum vices, but to deal with the quarter compre
hensively and determine how far the health ordi
nances of the city are obeyed there and how far thej"
are violated.
In making the investigation there should be a close
house to house inspection. Every building in the dis
trict should be scrutinized, every passage in it ex
plored, whether above ground or below ground, and
every room opening off the passages examined and
the number of persons occupying it determined;
When that investigation has been made it will then be
the duty of the jury or of its committee to see how far
the facts thus obtained conform to the laws of the
city. Wherever a violation of the law is noted a com
plaint should be filed against the offending party.
One thing is to be borne in mind. Little or no
benefit can be derived from an investigation of China
town unless it be made with thoroughness, firmness,
impartiality and strict honesty. It will do no good to
have a. dozen or more wretched Chinamen arrested
for keeping unclean premises, but it will do a world
of good if every property-owner whose buildings are
unsanitary be compelled to obey the law and put them
iti proper condition.
. Some of the richest men in San Francisco are own
ers of property in Chinatown and some of the build
ings belonging to the richest owners are about the
foulest. These men who have profited in the past by
violating the health regulations will protest and will
fight against any effort at reform. It is the duty of
the Grand Jury to face that fight and not shrink from
it, even should the Health Board back up the prop
erty-owners. The Kinyoun quarantine has given San
Francisco the last disastrous lesson the people are
willing to have from Chinatown. There is now a de
mand for reform. Will the Grand Jury undertake the
j w.ork? Will the new broom sweep clean?

DOMESTIC IMPERIALISM.
AS we have said, the Republican platform is con
servatism itself as to the status of Porto Rico
and the Philippines. There is no acceptance
of either as an integral part of this Union. They are
not incorporated into the Union of the United States,
as Louisiana was. Nor are their people absorbed
into our body politic and become a part of our fellow
citizenship. No constitutional guarantee extends to
them, nor are they felt as part of our political bone
and flesh, only to be separated by political surgery.
When the people have undeceived themselves as to
the value of tropical possessions they can do as they
choose with these evils which have fallen to us by the
fortunes of war.
In this there is no imperialism. There is merely
that pause which nations take in a novel and un
expected situation, while the sober second thought is
catching up with events which have got ahead of it.
In the midst of this pause the. voice of Bryan
breaks the silence in a denunciation of imperialism.
The State platform of his party in California "de
nounces imperialism infill of its forms," but did the
convention mean it? . â¢
Imperialism is either a denial to a people of liberty
they have not had but desire to have, or the denial to
them of liberty that has been guaranteed to them in
the solemn promises of a political state and which
The first and second empires of France were ex
amples of the second form. We have that same form
in this country, now in operation and indorsed by the
Bryan Democracy. The constitution gives the ballot
to the negro. In the solid South, upon whqse unani
mous electoral vote Colonel Bryan relies for the
achievement of his ambition, this constitutional right
is taken away from the negro, not because he is a
negro but because he votes the Republican ticket.
This was at first done by violence and murder, but
now it is done by law. This is not a statement based
on hearsay evidence, nor is it a campaign charge
made to affect the passion of voters. It is the open
afowal of Southern Senators in the Senate of the
United States. Tillman of South Carolina, member
of Bryan's national committee and expectant Secre
tary of the Navy if Bryan is elected, in a speech to
the Senate said of these negro Republican voters:
"We took the government away from them. We shot
them. We used tissue ballots and frauds. At length,
growing tired of these things, we amended the State
constitutions and eliminated the negro vote."
Here is the boast, made in the Serate, that Mr.
Bryan's party in thirteen States of the Union forbids
the exercise of a right especially bestowed by the
constitution. To do this they have used everything
from a shotgun to a statute. Murder was the instru
ment favored in all those States until, as Senator Till
man admits, they grew tired of murder and accom
plished the same end by State law. The right which
the constitution gives and they take away is the right
to vote, described as the right preservative of all
rights. Without it there can be no consent of the
governed. Colonel Bryan's party has deprived, by
murder, fraud and law, ten millions of people of the
right to consent or dissent to the Government under
which they live. They are not denied a right for which
they hoped, but one which, they had. If government
without consent of the governed be imperialism, this
is the domestic article. What will Colonel Bryan's
party do about it? Do they expect the country to
pay any attention to their denunciation of the Repub
lican party for ignoring consent of the governed in
Luzon while they deny it in Louisiana? Why is such
denial worse in Negros than in North Carolina? In
Senator White's eloquent and excellent speech to the
late Democratic convention he dedicated his life to
the principle of freedom of which the essence is the
consent of the governed. The sentiment is noble and
does the eminent gentleman credit. But will he be
consistent and advocate the same consent of the gov
erned for the negritos of Panay and the negroes of
Alabama? The platform which he wrote and re
ported says that this Government cannot endure half
republic and half empire. Let us make a further para
phrase of Mr. Lincoln's declaration, and ask if it can
endure with the ballot, guaranteed by the constitu
tion, denied in one-half the Union by murder, fraud
and law?
North of Mason and Dixon's line every man lives
under government by consent. South of it consent is
denied to ten millions of people because they do not
vote the Bryan ticket. The constitution requires
that the representation of any State in the House of
Representatives and the Electoral College shall be
reduced in proportion to the number of its people
who are denied the right to consent to the govern
ment by being deprived of the right to vote. The peo
ple of the Northern States, where government by
consent prevails, where no one is denied the ballot,
are defrauded by the Southern representation in the
House and the Electoral College, based upon the
enumeration of ten millions of people who are forbid
den their constitutional right to vote. The fraud of
this form of domestic imperialism is a double crime
and each offense is against the Federal constitution.
It is not without interest to reflect that if Colonel
Bryan is elected denouncing external imperialism it
will be by this domestic imperialism which deprives
ten millions of people of the right of consent to their
government! If he is elected it will be by electoral
votes based on. the enumeration of ten millions of
people deprived of self-government by his , party.
These things may not be pleasant. The truth is often
offensive. But that they are true no partisan of
Colonel Bryan dare deny.
The influence of New York in the convention and her
great vote in the Electoral College determined the
final choice.
Roosevelt has had a somewhat picturesque and al
ways interesting career. His public life began in the
New York Legislature and he has served as Civil Ser
vice Commissioner, Police Commissioner in New
York, Assistant Secretary of the j Navy, lieutenant
colonel of a regiment of Rough Riders in the Spanish
war and Governor of New York. He has a good deal
of independence, is a poor programmer and, when he
chooses, takes the bit in his teeth and goes his own
gait.
When he presides over the Senate that highly con
ventional body will likely be shocked by his uncon
ventional ity, but the country will like his heartiness
and robustness and will tolerate him good-naturedly,
even when he is wrong.

lecture was given under the auspices of

way.
"We have changing definitions," said
Mr. Mills, "of every human Interest, vet
we believe it possible to so, characterize
religion that our definition will be appro

definitions-. Religion is that fine sense of
the soul that connects the Individual with
universal purpose.. Every religion experi

Is the religious expression. If a man real
izes the existence of universal purpose
and surrenders himself to its -fulfillment
the surrender and his victory will be iden

we allow the realization of universal pur
pose to "grow within us we shall be able
to attain the sweetness of perfect peace,
which will fill our souls with a fearless
love and make life, death and the vast

NEW DEFINITION OF
RELIGION EXPOUNDED
Pastor of the First Baptist Church
Enlightens His Congregation
Anant Them.
In a prelude to his regular Sunday even
ing sermon Hev. E. A. Woods, pastor of
the First Baptist Church, last night
preached on â¢The Chinese Boxers." In
part he said:
The "Boxers" is an organization among the
Chinese, the object of which Is the expulsion
of all foreisners and the auppressicn of for
eign influence. The purpose of the members
is not religious, but political. All foreigners,
whether missionaries or tradesmen or traveler*,
are objects of hatred to them and are called
â¢"foreign devils." The native Christians have
been great sufferers, not merely because they
were Christians, but because of their connec
tion with forelsnern or foreign influences. The
"Boxers," or "Big Sword Society," is a secret
order. It has lodges, signs and passwords,
holds secret meetings and has solemn oaths,
which are pledged by drinking water mixed
with blood' drawn from their own veins. Such
secret political societies have existed among
the Chinese for centuries.
The "Boxer" movement is of great import
ance at this time because it seems to have the
approval of the Empress Dowager. The young
Emperor of China is supposed to be somewhat
in sympathy with progress and reform, and
there are millions of younger and better edu
cated Chinese who are his followers. There
are these two opposing parties in China. The
itrenger headed by the Empress Dowager, the
weaker led by the supplanted Emperor. The
"Boxers" are In league with the stronger party
and are opposed to all reforms. The "Boxer"
movement has now developed into a war with
Europe and the United States, as allies agaln3t
the anti-reform tarty In China. No one of
these nations will consent to remain inactive
while her citizen*, residents of China, are be
ing butchered without cause and contrary to
treaty r,ghts. Their lives must be protected
at all hazards and to accomplish this troops
have been landed on Chinese soil and hostili
ties have actually begun. The Issue Ie not
doubtful. Whether the results shall be the
restoration of the Emperor and national re
form or the actual dismemberment of China
and her control by the alllc-d powers, time alone
can reveal. Ir Is an inexorable law that the
nation which arrays itself against human pro
gress shall be overridden. To this law China
will not lorr remain an exception.
CHINESE BOXERS WERE
DISCUSSED BY DR. WOODS
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the
Third Congregational Church, occupied
his pulpit last night after an absence of
several months.* A large audience greet
ed him and listened to his description of
his travels and his views on the cus
toms and people of the Old World. His
subject â¢ was "Signs of the Times as
Seen In the Old World." In part he said:
Is the world growing better? Yes and no.
It dcx>Â« not grow better as a shot flies but an
a ship Â«ails. Neither is the advance uniform,
but in spots. The following are some signs
of the times:
1. The world is full of contrasted progress and
poverty. Everywhere is wealth and every
where rags. In Europe are the very rich and
the very poor. The military tax. like a great
sandbag, holds down the balloon of the people's
life. It can not rise.
2. The top of society is more wicked than the
bottom, 'lhe dangerous point of Vesuvius is
the top. not the bottom. Monte Carlo is worse
than 'Whltechapel. The church must send mis
sionaries to the higher circles. Poverty must
not be considered synonymous with vice. Li
centiousness political corruption, intemperance
in high placesâ these are the signs of the hour,
which test European civilization'to the utmost.
The *ecd s of sin are in luxury rather than in
poverty.
3 War The European nations want war.
Hence the navies gather around the gates of
China. Lord Salisbury says England has no
friend and calls upon every Englishman to
look after his rifle. France is bitter asralnst
England. America Is England's best iriend.
The heart of England is sound and true. The
higher America must recognize it. I am not a
prorhet but I can see a world war Involving
the nations of the earth. The Anglo-Saxon is
to Inherit tbe earth. It may be manifest Ues
tiny or the spirit of conquest. It may be by
force of arms or providence. I know not. But
such seems to be the future ot the race. Ar
mies are gathering at strategic points and the
worla is to be filled with the thunder of war.
iireat events are ahead.
4 There is no great mind in Europe. No
master spirit in America. No poet sings the
song of the higher civilization. Europe wants
Etatesmanshlp more than gun?. There Is more
material for generals on the field than for
tta.tesmen In the war office.
On the other hand there are signs of encour
agement and cheer. The English church Is alive
and the English home the nation's safeguard
and defense. Great, strong preachers aie de
livering the gospel truths with more fervor
than ever before. The Pope of Rome stands a
tower of strength against the tides of sin. I
stood In the Colliseum of Rome where Chris
tians were put to death and with the convic
tions that men were no more loyal then than
now. There are still utronfr. true people in the
?world. People who have In them the stuff of
martyrs. We must not think the world all
good or all bad. The same position is midway
between the two extremes.
I found a vital spiritual life in London and
Edinburgh. There is a controversy waging be
tween the established and the Independent
churches. Joseph Parker has preached to bus
iness men in the City Temple for thirty-one
years every Thursday at noon. . That Is a sign
of the times! Thirty-five thousand Catholic
pilgrims visited the shrine of. St. Peter's. Itome.
on Easter. That was a sign of the times. In
the English Parliament I heard an Impassioned
plea for the rule of the people. That Is a
t'.sn of the times. The rise of the common
man must be reckoned in with the solution of
the world problem. The Peel temperance meas
ure and the enthusiasm In reform in England
la another straw showing the direction- of tha
wind.

; .Chinaman Attempts Suicide.
Yee Tong Luck, a Chinese emigrant con
fined at the "Hotel Mongolia" at the Pa
cific Mail dock, threw himself into the bay
yesterday and would have been drowned
but for tne quick work of Watchman
Minook, who secured a boat and effected
the rescue of the would-be suicide. There
can be no doubt of the intentions of the
Chinese, for he awaited his opportunity
to slip past the guard, ran headlong down
the steps to the wharf and then sprang
into the water, making no effort to save
himself. After the rescue he was taken to
the Harbor Hospital, where Dr. Maguire
spent several hours in resuscitating him.
Later in the day he was returned to the
Mail dock under a guard of customs of
ficers.
Overdue Snip Reported Safe.
The Merchants' Exchange has received
a dispatch from Port Townsend announc
ing the safe arrival of the British ship
Troop., which had been posted as overdue
and on which 5 per cent reinsurance had
been paid. The Troop was out fifty-two
days from Shanghai, which is rather a
long passage, but not long enough under
most conditions to cause any anxiety.
The American ship John Currier, over
which some anxiety was felt, has arrived
safely at Port Townsend, sixty days from
Hongkong.

NEWS FROM THE
OGEAH AND THE
WATER FROST
0-~ NE of Sonoma County's beautiful
women, Mrs. Jennie 1_ Spridgeon,
was married Saturday, the fortun
ate groom being Frank D. Donohue.
well known In San Francisco. Oakland
and Santa Rosa, which latter city he now
calls his home, though he has business
connections that compel him to spend
much of his time In this city and In Oak
land.
The bride is a daughter cf Tennessee
Bishop, one of Sonoma County's best
known residents, he having been prom
inent in politics there, and served two
terms as Sheriff of the county. The lady
Is one of five highly accomplished sisters,
all noted for their beauty, and who have
always occupied a high place in the so
ciety of Santa Rosa. The lady who is
now Mrs. Donohue is one of the most
charming and handsome of the five.
Mr. Donohue is engaged in the art stone
and marble busings and Is quite well
known lit art circles, he being himself a
sculptor. He was formerly engaged in
business in San Francisco exclusively. He
and his bride, after their honeymoon trip,
will reside in Sa.nta Rosa.
Aside from the prominence given it by
the wide acquaintance they enjoy the
marriage of this coupie is made notable
by thÂ»* fact that they were united in
Reno. Nevada. Mr. Donohue having been
divorced very recently. They journeyed
to Reno and had the marriage ceremony
performed there, having all the time full
knowledge of Judge Belcher's recent de
cision to the effect that the marriage of
any person divorced In California, per
formed within one year after that divorce,
no matter where the ceremony might take
place, was illegal within the borders of
California.
This is the first couple that has chosen,
to flout Judge Belcher's decision and the
two feel perfectly satisfied that they are
legally united, and that the decision of the
Supreme Court will substantiate them.
"The marital step of Mr. Donohue and
the lady who is now nis wife was taken
only after receiving what they felt to be
the best legal advice obtainable in San
Francisco." said a friend of Mr. Dono
hue in this city last evening. "This ad
vice, obtainf'l from some of San Fran
cisco's most eminent lawyers, was to the
effect that Judge Belcher's decision was
not good law and that it would be re
versed by the Supreme Court. The many
friends of the couple have loaded them
with congratulations and all is as it
should be."
Mr. and Mrs. Donohue will doubtless re
ceive numerous congratulatory messages
from the hundreds of lovers who made
the hymeneal pilgrimage to Reno and then
had the peaceful tenor of their marital
lives rudely Jarred by Judge Belcher's
disjoining opinion. The army of Reno
brides and groom? will perhaps be filled
with admiration of the brave couple who
would not let the unpopular decision de
prive them of what they believed to be
their right to be united in the holy bonds
of wedlock.
MR. AND MRS. FRANK D. DONOHUE, WHO BRAYED BELCHER DECISION.
The National Committee.
Candidates for President and Vice Presi
dent are dominated by national conven
tions of the several parties.
The national committee of a political
party consists of one member from each*
State and Territory. It organizes by
choosing from its own number a chair
man, secretary, treasurer and executive
commitee, and its principal business Is the
management of the Presidential campaign.
In that comprehensive statement is in
cluded a vast and varied array of duties.
To the national committee belongs, be
sides a general oversight of the national
interests of the party, the raising of im
mense sums of money to be used in the
campaign and the appropriation of the
same in ways most effective for the suc
cess of the party in the approaching elec
tion; the preparation or procuring, print
ing and disseminating of great quantities
of campaign literature; the employment
of speakers and the assisting of the State
Central Committees In conducting the
campaign In their several States; the de
cision as to the time and place for hold
ing the national convention, and the is
suing of the call which brings that body
together.
Local Arrangements for a National
Convention.
The convention Is held in a large- city
and in an auditorium <.now usually a
building erected for the purpose) large
enough to accommodate many spectators.
The privilege of admission to the specta
tors' seats is highly prized, tickets for
seats sometimes selilng for as much as
550. Arrangements are made by a local
committee of prominent citizens, the com
mittee having nrmny sub-divisions â for ex
ample, upon hotels, transportation, music,
decoration, reception and many other
matters. A vast amount of work 13 re
quired and provided for.
Composition of the Convention.
The official call for the convention desig
nates the number of delegates to which
each State is entitled. Each State sends
twice as manv delegates as it has elec
toral votes, and each Territory may send
two delegates. In Democratic conventions
Territorial delegates do not vote; in Re
publican conventions they may. In 1S32
the Republican National Convention
adopted a rule requiring all delegates to
be chosen by the Congressional districts
of each State, except the four delegates
at larse. who should be elected at a State
convention. No uniform rule has been
adopted by the Democrats.
Organization of the Convention.
The chairman of the National Commit
tee calls the convention to order and reads
the official call. Some distinguished
clergyman is then usually called upon to
offer pray or. A temporary orgar.iza.tion
having been effected, it is customary to
vote that the convention be governed by
the rules of the preceding convention "un
til otherwise ordered." Republican con
ventions make frequent changes in their
rules of procedure. Democratic conven
tions are accustomed to adhere to those
which have become time-honored. The
Important business of the first day is
completed by appointing the various com
mitteesâon credentials, on permanent* or
ganization, on rules and on resolutions
each committee being composed of one
member from each State and Territory
chosen bv the delegation from his own
State or Territory.
The convention cannot proceed to the
work for which it was called until the
composition of the body is determined,
and that is dependent upon the report of
the committee on credentials. Sometimes
it is obliged to adjourn from day to day
for several days waiting for the adjust
ment of questions as to contested seats.
When there are but one or two disputed
seats the "regular" delegates are almost
invariably admitted. Occasionally, how
ever, two full delegations appear from a
single State, each making out a strong
claim. Such a depute may be settled by
compromise, each delegate being given
half a vote. Though the report of the
committee on credentials is generally ac
cepted by the convention, it has beeji in
a few Instances rejected. The Republi
can convention cf 1SS0. for instance, re
jected the committee's report. The rule
referred to above, adopted in \$Q2. was de
sisnod to prevent further difficulties of
the sort.
The report of the committee en per
manent organization ccmes next in orrier.
and is adopted by unanimous vote. The
large number of permanent officials in
cludes, besides the president and the
honorary vice-presidents (one from
among the delegates of each State and
Territory-, chosen by the several delega
tions), a" formidable array of secretariesâ
"chief," "assistant" and "honorary"â a
sergeant-at-arms. with some twenty as
sistants, and official stenographers. As
in the Stae convention the permanent
chairman, upon taking his seat, delivers
a formal speech upon the issues of the
day.
The report of the committee on rules
now follows. It comprises an order of
business for the convention and a- re
statement of the rules of the convention
next preceding, with such amendments as
the committee judges wise. Considerable
time may be spent in the discussion of
proposed changes.
The Platform.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions should be next in crder, and while
waiting for it various matters of business
may be transacted by the convention. The
committee to notify the successful aspir
ants of the nomination and the new na
tional committee may then be elected.
Each Is usually made up of one member
from each State and Territory, designat
ed by the respective delegations.
The platform is usually adopted "plank"
by " nlank," as reported, and without op
position. Any delegate may, however,
vote to omit or amend any resolution.
Sometimes a long and important debate
may occur upon a question of party pol-
l C y_a debate which may result in a
change of policy. This is illustrated in
the action of the Democratic convention
of 1892, which substituted a resolution fa
voring "tariff for revenue only" for one
reported advocating "moderate protec
tion " A hot discussion upon the finan
cial resolutions reported to the Republi
can convention of 1803 was followed by
the formal secession from the party of
several delegates from "silver States.
The Nominations.
The platform having been agreed upon,
the rea'Â«~busine.ss for which the conven
tion has met is at last undertakenâ the
nomination ef candidates. In spite of the
long preliminary canvass, many names
are sometimes proposed. The Republican
convention of 1S8S' cast ballots for nine
teen different persons. The roll of States
is called in alphabetic order, and each
State delegation has the right to nomi
nate a Presidential candidate. Of course
not all avail themselves cf the privilege,
but the opportunity is often made use
of to compliment some leading ami fa
vorite politician of the Stute with no
thought of his receiving the nomination.
Sometimes a State delegation nominates a
citizen of another State. Mr. Elaine was
nominated In 1S92 by the delegation from
Colorado. Details are carefully arranged
beforehand, plans being laid to present
the names ot favorite candidates In the
most effective manner. Names are us
ually proposed in elaborate, oratorical
speeches, prepared long before, eulogizing
the nominees in the loftiest nights of elo
quence and skillfully "working up" the
audience to a pitch of enthusiasm which
manifests Itself In tumultuous applause.
A nomination is seconded by another dele
gate, who may also indulge in a display
of oratory, and who may be followed by
othtrs.
When the balloting begins the long roll
of States Â¦ Is calledâ usually again and
again, for only rarely is a nomination
made en the first ballot. The chairman
of each State delegation rises in his place
to declare for whom the vote of his State
is cast â either announcing the vote of a
majority of his delegation 89 the vote of
his State, according to the "unit rule."
or . stating the actual vote of the" mem
bers of his delegation, which may or may
not be divided. Any delegate may chal
lenge the return of votes made by the
chairman of his delegation, and in such
a case the secretary of the convention
calls the roll of that delegation.
In a few Instances, when some one man
has become known aa the undo _t> fe_ ;
preference of his party, nomination, has.;
been made by acclamation. Martin Van{
Buren was so nominated in 1S35, Henryi
Clay in 1S44 and Grover Cleveland ia 1SS3.'-
General Grant received the unanimous,
vote of the Republican convention bot_<
in 1S63 and 1S72. In Democratic conven-j
tlons. it Will be remembered, two-thirds of:
the vote is required to nominate a. candlâ Â«
date. In Republican conventions a, sim-*"
pie majority is sufficient.
The repeated calling of the roll of States:
gives opportunity fcr delegates to change*
their votea. As each bailot is taken and
counted the resu!t3 are announced to t_ a;
convention. Day after dav ia sonafttimea 1
consumed in this tedious m_r_ier. Forty-i
nine ballots were necessary for the Domlâ j
nation of Franklin Pierce in 1S52. fiftyâ 1
three for that of General Scott la tlae*
same year.
While the balloting goes on and a _Â»â¢
cislve result Is not reached many confarâ
ences take place among the clelegatlonaL'
Influences, some legitimate, seme qu_Â»â Â¦
tlonable. are brought to bear to induco
Individuals or delegations to transfer 1
their support from one aspir__t to an
other. In case several leading men arw
before the convention and the friends of
neither are disposed to yield, a "darfc
horse" may at the right moment be an
nounced as a candidate and may u_e_-'
pectecll}' receive the nomination. T_e
"dark horse" is a r__ 1 oX comparative
obscurity or of promlnoncf* only ia a lirs-;
ited portion of the country- Several Pres
identa have come before the convention a_
dark horses. Such were Polk. Taylor,
Fierce. Hayes. Garneld and Harrison.
A nomination having been made by th_
requisite number of ballots. It is "good
form" for the principal supporter of tiia
candidate receiving the number of votea
nearest to that of the successful man to
move that the nomination be mide uaanl*'
mous. Supporter? of other aspirants 8?<v
ond the motion, which is always carried,
amid great applause. In recent years it;
h:w been customary for the chairman of a.;
Republican convention when a nominations
has been made to put the question imme-J
diately. "Shall the nomination be mada*
unanimous?"
The nomination of a Vice President Is a
comparatively tame affair. The proce4t__j
Is the same as that already described.
After attending to the remaining routine
business the convention a_Jour_3 sine dleu.
Party Loyalty.
A much-vexed question always ames la
connection with the action of a party con
vention. It is as to the obligation upon thÂ»
members of the party to support tha
nominees of the convention. Theoretically,
party loyalty requires all to abide by thÂ©
decisions of the authorized representa
tives of the party, but party discipline has
never yet been able to coerce individual
action, though strong efforts are made to
place a stigma upon the "bolter" or tha
"kicker" who refuses to vote the party
ticket. The Republican convention of 1S30
parsed almost unanimously a resolution,
called the "ironclad pledge," declaring?
"that every member of this convention la
bound in honor to support its nominee,
whoever that nominee may be, and thac
no man should hold his seat here who la
not ready so to agree." But when four
years later an eâ ort was made by the
Republicans to pass a similar motion Is
was found impossible, and It 13 known
that a number of the prominent delegate*
to that convention labored and voted for
the election of the Democratic candiiiate-
The Campaign.
The two nominees of the convention aroj
now the party "standard bearers" and all4
the members of the party are expected to-"
"rally round" them and use every en
deavor to win for the party a "glorious
victory" In the autumnal election. ThO'
delegates return to their hones carrying]
-with them the enthusiasm generated In.:
the great national assemblage. Under tEe
general guidance of the National Commit
tee the Intricate network of party cona-^
mittees covering the country goes vigor-;
ously into the work of "orpajilzing the
campaign." Business from sea to sea 13
more or less interrupted for the foui* or>
five months during which the American;
people are engaged in pettlnK ready ton
elect a chief masri?trate. Thousands upon.;
thousands of "c mpaign speakers" and
millions? of newspaper articles and politi
cal tracts are supposed to assist thÂ»,
American voter In making: up his mind
how he fhall vote, while many millions of
dollars are devoted to the same purpose- .
Early In November the voter walks to thai
polls (cr rides in a fine carriage hired -with'
the party '"campaign fund") and deposits
an Australian ballot which records his de
cision, and a few hours later his conclu-,
sion is known to the whole civilized world.,
A ruler for a mishty people has beea;
chosen. A great party has coma into:
power or has succeeded In retaining power*
for another four years. Jealousies. dlsat>-<
pointements and heart-burnings remain to*
embitter individual lives, but the country
returns to its legitimate occupation o? 1
making a livir.jr. while the politicians,
commence laying plans for the next Presi
dential contest.

WHEN DOCTORS DISAGREE
W_at Becomes of the Patient?
Doctors have their hobbles as well as
other people and in the treatment of dls-
i case often carry them too far for the pa-
j tienfs good. For Instance In the Â¦ treat-
ment of indigestion or dyspepsia many
doctors grlve bismuth and nothing else,
others rely on pepsin to bring their pa-
tients through, still another doctor treats
stomach troubles with the various vege-
table essences and fruit salts.
Xotv one or the other of these excellent
remedies becomes a hotby with the doc-
tor who has had most success with the
particular one in question, because all of
them are first-class remedies for indiges-
tion and dyspepsia, but not one of them
I alone is fo good as a combination of all
i of them, such as is found in Stuart's
j Dyspepsia Tablets, which contains not
I only vegetable essences and fruit salts.
! but also the freshest, purest pepsin and
I bismuth, making altogether a remedy un-
'Â¦ surpassed for every form of indigestion,
; sour Ftoir.ach. nervous dyspepsia, belch-
i ing: of ga?. distress after eating, sleep-
! lessness, hcadachÂ«=r=. etc.
, Stuart's Dyppei'fia Tablets !s not a se-
: ore* patent nostrum, but you can see for
: yourself what it is. and knowing: this, its
; turcess as a dyspepsia cure is not sur-
: prising. All druggists recommend and
; sell them at 53 cents.

also in delicacy. Mr. Mansfield did not
compete in the distance casting, at which
he is the champion, but carried oft* the
honors in the accuracy event. Mr. Broth
erton was in the lead at lure casting. All

Two representatives of the Sacramento
Helvetia Rifle Club were on the range as
the guests of the marksmen. Jacob Meyer
and E. Schmidt arrived early and took a
hand in the sport In several of the clubs'
stands. They easily showed their ability
to handle the fine rifle, although the range
conditions were strange to them. The
Sacramento club has nearly forty mem
bers and all are provided with the best of
modern target rifles.
Nearly all of the shooting stands on the
Shell Mound range were filled with marks
men yesterday, each endeavoring to win
for himself high record, special prize or
general marksmen's honors. The day was
as pleasant as could be desired, although
a strong wind was blovdng in from the
Golden Gate. On the long ranges this
caused Bome little annoyance, causing the
bullets to drift several inches. Even on
the fifty-yard range its strength was felt.
The attendance was large and every score
v.-as conscientiously completed, for as the
time for the national rifle tournament ap
proaches the local shots desire to lose no
opportunity for perfecting themselves with
their favorite firearm. Taken on the
whole, the scores made were good, but
nothing to cause special comment.
Jacob Meyer and E. Schmidt of the
Sacramento Club Took a Hand
in the Sport With Good
Results.
Fair Scores Were Made by
the Riflemen at the Shell

Pacific Eleven Defeats the California
Team by a Good Margin
at Alameda.
As is frequently the case In cricket, the
unexpected happened yesterday In the
match between the California and Pacific
clubs on the Webster-8trÂ«et grounds, Ala
meda, the Pacific eleven beating thÂ© cham
pions of last year by the good margin of
78 runs. The California team went to the

men obtained double figures â G. Schroeder
21 and W. Reed (not out) 11. Casidy, San
diland and Soles captured eight wickets,
Casidy taking five. Coles two and Sandl
land one. The innings closed for 60 runs.
This total was all but beaten by C. P.
Coles of the Pacifies, who scored 54 runs.
J. Myers complied 54, the California total
being beaten by 42 runs at the fall of the
first wicket. After the dismissal of Coles
and Myers wickets fell rapidly, the third
and fourth falling at 124 and the flfth and
sixth at 125. The innings closed with a
score of 13S for nine wickets, A. B. Willis
being absent. The captain of the Califor
nia captured four wickets and Sloman
took the same- number. Roberts, Guild
and L. Schroeder were also tied, but with
out success. The California fielding was
loose, as is shown by the large number
of extras. The full scores are given here

had left her home carrying with her a
parcel containing her jewelry valued at
$196. The three boys followed her and
when she reached an alley they seized
her and grabbed the package of jewelry-
They ran away and the woman at once
notified the police. Her husband hired
eight boys, paying them $2 each, to dis
cover tho thieves. They furnished him,
with the names of four youngsters whom
they claimed committed the robbery and
the arrest of Shea followed. The Chinese
merchant offered to pay the parents of
one of the boys $30 If the valuables were
returned and not prosecute the case
against him, but the jewelry had been sold
for $2 50 and could cot be returned. It has
since been nearly all recovered by the po
lice. There are two other boys, compan
ions of the four arrested, whom Gibson
and Hutchings expect to capture at any
moment.
"Everything seemed to be safe," said
the son in telling of the accident, "and
father left me at the tiller to go for
ward and let go the jib sheet, as that
Father and son started yesterday fore
noon, about 11:30, to indulge in their
usual Sunday pleasure, a sail about the
bay in a fourteen-foot skiff. A new suit
of eail? had been provided and as they
did not work quite satisfactorily the
father left his seat In the stern of the
boat to adjust part of the forward rig
ging:. The squall came on while he was
engaged in this work and the boat was
keeled over.
ONE of thope treacherous winds that
sometimes blows in Mission bay cap-
Fizcd a small craft off the Arctic
OH Works yesterday and the
drowning of David Hpheyihan, of Texas
street, near Army, the father of a family
of seven children, resulted. John Honey
man, For. of the drowned mr.n, also came
near lesine his life.
THREE small boys implicated In the
robbery of the wife of Quan
Ji Illng, a wealthy Chinese mer
chant living at 516 Washington
street, on June 14, were arrested by De
tective Ed Gibson and Police Officer
Hutchings yesterday afternoon and taken
to the City Prison, where they were book
ed for a public institution. Their names
are Ralph Amaraso, 12 years of age;
Charles Spano, 11. and Tony Chlrelll. 10.
Chirelii denies that he had anything to
do with the robbery, but the other two
admit their guilt. Frank Shea, another
of the boy robbers, was arrested about
a week ago and was held to answer by
Judge Fritz. He is 16 years of age and
will probably bo sent to the Whlttler Re
formatory. -;. Â¦'â¢*:'-
The three boys arrested are waifs and
have been sent several times to public
Institutions. They are incorrigibles and
none of the institutions will gleefully re
ceive them again. They have been sleep
ing at nights under an old counter in a
vacant lot near Jackson street and Mont
gomery avenue. What to do with them is

There was another bad inning: for the
fireman, who was scattered all over the
field in the eighth for several different
varieties of hits. The four runs made In
this Inning gave Sacramento the game.
Devereaux was on the slab for Sacra
mento and he gave a creditable perform
ance In twirling. The errors on both
sides were plenty enough. In the eighth
Krug struck hla fist against the shed
fence in left field and was replaced by
Rube Levy. Tho score is:
In the Eeventh Inning Heine Krug re
deemed himself for an error In the first
by losing the ball over the left field fence.
Reitz was sunning himself on second, and
these two resulting runs gave Frisco the
lead.
It was not "a bit of hard luck" that
lost the game for the local "team yester
day morning at Oakland, but some off
the-carth twirling by Fltzpatrick In the
first inning, when he filled the bases by
not keeping hi3 wicks trimmed to the ne
cessities of the plate, was responsible.
Two men were forced over the rubber by
the fireman's penchant for balls, not a
single hit being made.

SUMMARY
SACRAMENTO.
The last of the fourth was a maelstrom
of excitement. Sullivan started the ball
rolling by a two-bagger, but was soon
afterward caught napping off the bag.
Pabst walked, to first, to the great glee
of the fans, and a hit by Reitz sent him
to second. Krug followed with a four
ball constitutional to llrst, and the sacks
were then crowded. It was up to .Josh
Reilly to do something. Finding a ball to
his liking he let drive, and away it went
to far center. To the great surprise. of all
Shanahan dropped it and Pabst crossed
the rubber. A double play ended the
inning. Iburg hitting to Hughes, who shut
out Keitz at the plate by throwing home
and Iburg was beaten out at first.
In the fifth inning the champions added
another run. McL.augh.lin worked off a
double on Iburg and scored on an error in
an attempted double play between Reilly
and Schwartz, whose error was account
able for the run. â¢
In the eighth Sacramento unloosened on
Iburg again, and before Frisco came to
the benches Hanlon and Stanley had
crossed the rubber. In the latter part of
this inning Uncle's men did a few things.
A double by Krug and a single by Reilly
gave Frisco their second run.
The ninth ! meant two extra runs for
the champions. The score:
Umpire Graves needs an oculist. Some
thing ails his eyes; At any rate he saw
things yesterday that didn't happen and
missed others that did. Some of the fa
natics in the stand swear that he was so
blind that he didn't see the remarkable
work of Reilly at short, who ate up
everything: that came within a league
or two of his mitts, or the marvelous
catch of Shanahan In the first Inning,
when he turned the corner of the center
field fence and after a contortlonal twist
pulled the ball down with his left fist.
Then there were double plays of big cal
iber, hits of eood range and enough errors
to keep the crowd guessing. Yet with
it all Uncle Hank is sad, for he captured
not one of the series of three. What the
local team needs forms a too extended list
to be treated of in a single chapter.
The second inning gave the small boy
on the Scoreboard something to do. Han-
Ion rolled the ball along the third base
line and before he stopped in his sack
career he was on third. Then Stanley
slammed the ball hard to Reilly, who
threw home to stave off Hanlon, but Sul
livan dropped the sphere and one run was
registered, Stanley being safe on lirst. A
hit by Doyle sent Stanley to third and
another by Shanahan scored him. That
was all the run getting In this innning.
"Just like the old days," was the
thought of the fanatics at the baseball
game yesterday afternoon up to the
eighth inning. At times the crowd j' and
the players oalpitated with excitement
and partisanship, and even the umpire,
he of the tombstone name, made It inter
esting by a number of questionable, de
cisions that Intensified the Interest of the
crowd and once drew forth heated Im
precations from the throat of the Irish
lad, Mr. Sullivan of Hankville.

performances. Three times she landed on

play was made on her chances.

POET COOK WAS HAUGHTY.
Met Her Match in a Woman Who
Writes for Newspapers.
A South Side woman who writes poetry
also runs a fancy cooking establishment.
Both occupations are managed with fine
Impartiality, and the right hand never
knows what the left hand does. The
cooking establishment is never even re
motely referred to by the lady's friends
and calling acquaintances. One uncon
ventional caller did . get so far once as
saying:
-Oh, Mrs. B.. please send me $3 worth
of your chocol "
"My secretary. If you please," inter
jected the poet-cook' nastily and haught
ily, and the two women have not been on
speaking terms since, .
A newspaper writer who knew nothing
of these esthetic distinctions wrote an ar
ticle on "Fancy Cookery," and mentioned
Mrs. B. as a talented exponent of the
womanly art. A few days afterward the
poet-cooK and the newspaper woman met
in a tearoom downtown.
"It seems to me 1 have seen your face
before." Bald the poet-cook.
The newspaper writer has a poor mem
ory for faces and had to confess herself
at a loss.
"Oh, now I remember," said the poet
cook, reddening, "you are the person who
wrote that horrid article In which you
called me a cook! Me a cook!" and Bhe
groaned. "Yes. I know. I told you about
ft, 'but I never thought you would , use
names. I thought when I first saw you
that there was something peculiarly dis
agreeable In my recollections."
"I am very sorry you look at It In that
way," said the writer, and they talked
It out over the teacups. ,3K&
"Well. I suppose that you'll always
think of me as an unpleasant, fault-find
ing creature," said the poÂ«t-cook as they
parted. - .
"Oh, no, rejoined the newspaper writer,
"merely as a woman of rather narrow
outlook. Touknow.whea I do any. work
I'm . not ashamed of ! It, and when I'm
ashamed of it I don't do it. That's all,
thank you."â Chicago Inter Ocean.
Neglects Her Children.
Mrs. Margaret Skelly, 309 Third street,
was arrested yesterday by Officer Cole
man of the Pacific Coast Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
cruelty to her offspring. The children
one 9 years of age and the other 3â were
sent to the Youths' Directory. Coleman
found the room in which they lived in' a
filthy condition. Empty beer and whisky
bottles were scattered about. The wo
man has not been living with her hus
band, a longshoreman, since last August.
Broke the Conductor's Nose.
Conductor R. W. Sinclair of the Fol
sora-street trolley line has his nose In a
sling from the effects of a collision with
five young rowdies who rode on his car
on Saturday night. The young toughs
were on their way home after getting on
the outside of a cargo of steam beer,
when a difficulty arose over their fares.
The conductor, ever watchful that the
company he represents shall lose nothing
by jovial passengers, demanded full fare
from the pporty youths. This was dis
puted to puch an extent as to precipitate
a row, in which the conductor found his
nasal organ dislodged from its center of
gravity to one side of his face, where It
swelled to three times its normal size,
preventing him from looking at objects
straight. As a result of this the five
rowdies got away from him, but the
period of liberty was brief. Officers Per
cival and Brown gave them a ride on the
patrol wagon. When arraigned at the
prisoners' desk of the Seventeenth-street
police station they gave the. names of
George F. Ewing. Cnarlea McLaughlin,
James Terry, Dan Gleason and Fred
Walters. A charge of battery was placed
oppof4te their names on the prison sheet,
and to-day they will be given an oppor
tunity to tell one of the Police Judges
how it all happened.
MONAI>NOCK NOT TO GO.
WASHINGTON, June 24.â The order
contemplating the sending of the monitor
Monad nock to Taku was countermanded,
to-day. Admiral Remey reported that
the vessel had been stripped of her offi
cers, presumably for duties on the other
vessels, and for this and other reasons It
was not deemed advisable to send her.
Chief among these reasons, is the fact
that the typhoons now raging In the
eastern seas would make a voyage of
such a ship as the Monadnock, with her
low freeboard, very uncertain.

CAN'T FREEZE MICROBES.
The researches of Professor Dewar on
liquid air are familiar to all who take an
interest in the progress of scientific re
search at large. At a recent Royal Society
meeting an interesting communication
was made on behalf of Dr. A. Macfadyen
and Mr. S. Rowland on the effect of the
terrifically low temperature of liquid air
on microbes. The aim of the investigators
was that of ascertaining whether the
germs could survive cold of a degree
ranging from 1S3 to 192 degrees Centi
grade.
It is of course known that many specle3
of microbes can survive being packed In
ice, and even higher organisms nourish In
the Arctic Circle. Indeed, the extremes
of temperature for low forma of life are
widely separated, and so It becomes a
matter of practical public Interest, as I
shall show, to determine where the limits
of vitality In this respect are to be found.
The low temperature of liquid air offered
a supreme chance to see how microbes
comported themselves under exposure
thereto, and so our investigators seized
on tho opportunity presented them.
Exposed for twenty hours to the liquid
air temperature no injury was apparently
sustained by the microbes. But in the re
cent experiments such germs as those of
typhoid fever,' diphtheria, anthrax, chol
era and other ailments, along with non
dipease producing species, were submit
ted to the liquid air test for seven days.
In addition to the excessively low temper
ature I must add the microbes In this ex
periment wese subjected to a tremendous
mechanical strain.
Then came the question of the effects
of both conditions on the vitality of the
germs. These results may be summed up
in the word nil. Under the microscopes
they showed no signs of mechanical in
jury or distortion, and they were as lively
âif that term may be applied to denote
a condition of \-ltality â as they were pre
vlous to their chilling and cooling experi
ences.
I have referred to the public Interest
which attaches to these Investigations.
To know the limits of germ life Is an
essential Item in the knowledge of the
sanitarian when he undertakes to show
how infectious diseases caused by micrpb
ic action can be destroyed and prevented
from attacking us.
It has been lone known that we cannot
trupt to cold as a disinfecting and germ
killing agency. Cold will check germ
growth certainly, a fact we see Illustrated
by every cargo of Australian mutton that
Is landed at the docks, but It cannot de
stroy the microscopic living things that
are responsible for inducing disease, and
for causing decomposition, putrefaction
and a goodly number of other conditions
beneficial and the reverse.
. The investigations I have described con
firm fully the sanitary teachings about
cold. They also emphasize another little
bit of useful Informationâ namely, the
difference between a substance that really
kills Â¦ germs and one . that * merely
"scotches" them.
Were this distinction more clearly ap
prehended by the public we should prob
ably hear less frequently of mysterious
outbreaks of epidemics. . which probably
owe their origin as much to Inefficient
disinfection as to any other . piece of
human negl!gence.--London Express.

HENRY HAYES COMMITS
SUICIDE WITH REVOLVER
Despondency Through Being Sepax-
ated From Family Thought
to Be the Cause.
Henry Hayes, a dairyman in the em
ploy of Alvord Reynolds at 17 Franklin
street, committed suicide at an early hour
this morning by shooting himself in the
right side of the head. His employer
heard the shot, and after a search found
Hayes lying in one of the stalls of the
stable in the rear of the house. Hayes
was jetlll alive, and his employer had him
hurried to the Receiving Hospital, where
he died soon after his arrival.
The deceased was about 50 years of age,
and leaves a wife and four children liv

Despondency, caused by being separated
from his family. Is thought to have been
the cause of his act. Hayes once before
tried to end his life.
BERKELEY, June 24.â A decision Is ex
pected now from the Supreme Court of
California which will settle once for all
the validity of the Berkeley Justice
Court. Four liquor cases were appealed
from the Superior Court of Alameda
County about a month ago on the ground
that the Justice Court here was Invalid.
These cases may possibly be reversed,
owing to the fact that evidence showing
that a special census had been taken in
this city for the establishment of the
court had not been introduced. A de
cision of this sort will not, however, af
fect any of the other cases or the court.
In speaking of the decision, which Is ex
pected early next week. Town Attorney
Brewton A. Hayne said that there was no
reason to believe that the Berkeley court
was in danger. Justice Robert Edsrar.
who has been struggling at the head of
Berkeley's uncertain court since Its re-es
tablishment last July, feels that the de
cision of the Superior Court will be up
held and Berkeley justice placed on a sure
footing. 'Â¦ M _
The four appealed cases are those of T.

Baseball a Feature^ â An Old Man
Injured â Fun at Chutes
and Baths.
San Francisco's population went en
masse to the park and beach and other
pleasure places yesterday. The attraction
at the park was a ball game between the
Golden Gates and the Dan P. Carters. The
Carters came out victorious after a rous
ing game by a score of 6 to 4. Broadhurst
of the Carters landed two home runs dur
ing the game, and Barnett, who played
left field for the same team, trotted once
around the diamond while the opposing
team chased the sphere through the trees
that backed right field.
A "kid" team from Newman & Levin
son's went to the diamond with the Pep
pers. At the end of the game the score
stood about 4S to S6, but as each side
claimed the victory neither can be cred
ited with the same.
But one accident occurred during the
day. Mr. Schubert of 3017 Sixteenth street
was struck by Halght street car No. 167
just as it was leaving the Stanyan street
turntable and seriously injured. In addi
tion to a severe scalp wound he suffered
numerous bruises and contusions. He wag
removed to tho Receiving Hospital for
treatment.
An unusually large crowd visited the
Chutes during the day, and that they did
not witness a tragedy was due solely to
the fact that Wallace, the big lion, made
a slight miscalculation in distance. Frank
Hall, the lion-tamer, had Just completed
his act with Wallace and had reached the
escape door of the cage when the huge
brute sprang at him and swung his un
sheathed claws at the trainer's head. Hall
ducked and banged the door, but did not
escape unscathed. The lion's claws
scraped over his scalp and left painful
wounds behind. Had the lion measured
his distance the sfory would have been
different. The stuffed form of "Beauty,"
the long maned and tailed horse: llama
dryas, the lion slaying, baboons and Can
non, the fat man, are the features this
week.
A large crowd passed the day at Sutro's
baths and enjoyed the aquatic contests.
Following are the results: Fifty-yard
dash, P. Harris first, L. Hanna second;
underwater swimming contest, S. McDer
mott first. J. Carson second: diving for
plate, C. Augustus first, J. Wllburn sec
ond, C. Jones third; 100-yard dash, ama
teur, C. Jones first, J. Sherton second;
springboard diving, C. Duke first. F. Free
man second; high diving:, J. Patton first
prize, R. Herman second prize.
CROWDS ENJOY A DAY
AT PARK AND BEACH
It Is Expected That It Will Be
Dropped for Lack of
Prosecution.
The eas-e against Angelina Abbott, who
rhot De Witt Clinton some days ago,
will come up In the Police Court to-day,
but it Is not probable that anything will
be done. It is doubtful if Clinton will ap
pear, and it Is expected that the case will
end In a dismissal.
The proceedings now before the court
sre all at the suggestion and demand of
the defense. It was the intention of the
court to dismiss the case the first time
it came up because no complaint had
been filed, but to the surprise of every
one H. H. Lowenthal. who appeared as
the prisoner's attorney, demanded on
behalf of the prisoner that a complaint
be tiled, as he stated that it was the de
sire of the girl to bring the facts that
had led up to the shooting out in court.
As Clinton would hie no complaint, the
court ordered the arresting officer to file
one. This was done, and it is on this that
the case now rests.
The prisoner declares now that she
never wished to have a complaint filed
against her. and she pays all she wishes
is to be allowed out of jail. She will
probably be freed to-day, either by bail
or by the dismissal of the case; and" after
the defendant is out of prison, even on
bail, it is not probable that the case will
be prosecuted.
ANGELINA ABBOTT'S CASE
WILL BE CALLED TO-DAY

risky Job of finding out just what the ap
parently infernal machine really is.
A number of expert electricians who ex
amined the box were unanimous in the
ftaterncnt that so far as they knew the
apparatus was no part of any ordinary
electrical appliance. The fact that insu
lated wires lead to the center of the roll
of prepared paper leads to the belief that
there is inclosed a fulminating cap de

mass. Judging from its appearance and
general consistercv the preparation sur

piece and, tasting it. found it sweet, like
a preparation of glycerin.
The police officials pay they never before

bomb now in their possession. While they
assert that there could have been no ob
ject in placing the box where it was found,
they admit that it has a suspicious ap
pearance, and Fay they will refrain from
dissecting it until an expert has examined
The supposed petard is Inclosed in a
fmail wooden box painted a deep red. In
Eize it approximates that of an ordinary
buildir.g brick. It is the interior arrange
ment that causes tho ordinary individual
to tremble when he sees it carelessly
har.dled. It is best described as a hard
brick of fine linen paper covered with a
preparation resembling wax. The paper
is tightly wrapped with catgut. From
two small brass levers on opposite sides
of the bottom of the box lead two insu
lated wires. One runs over the top of the
paper and through the end of the roll, ap
parently to its center. The other appears
to be for connection with a battery wire.
William Gauge, the man who brought
the little red box to the police Ftatlon is
a gardener residing at 4S5 Twenty-first

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
HIS Broadway. June 24.
The Contra Costa Board of Supervisors
have decided to submit Henshaw-Macdon
ald route for an electric railroad to Point
Richmond as the route to be bid upon, and
this will be done at the meeting of that
board on Monday.
This is a complete victory for the two
Oakland financiers who are interested in
an electric railroad system between Oak
land and Point Richmond, and If they
are given the franchises it will mean the
immediate construction of the road. The
line requested by Messrs. Henshaw and
Macdonald Is the shortest route between
Oakland and Point Richmond and around
the point. It Is the most practicable route
and Includes a' spur to the town of San
Pablo, thus covering the territory be
tween Oakland and the present terminus
of the Santa Fe system.
Mr. Honshaw and Mr. Macdonald are
ready to go ahead with the construction
of the road at once. They already have
their plan3 for the construction of the
road made, and will apply to the Alameda
County Supervisors and the Berkeley,
Emeryville and Oakland City Councils as
soon as they secure their Contra Costa
franchises. These plans contemplate the
construction of an electric road similar to
the Oakland, San Leandro and Haywards
line. The same kind of cars and the same
kind of equipment will be used, and the
new road will be patterned upon the long
Haywards line. The personal relations
between the owners of the Haywards line
and the owners of the new system to
Point Richmond are so dose as to cause
the general belief that once the new Point
Richmond line gets into Oakland they
will work in harmony with the Haywards
line, If not form a traffic combination.
In fact. It Is generally believed that the
Santa Fe system, which seems to be
backing with Its moral. If not its financial,
support, the Henshaw-Maedonald syndi
cate, will then u?e the new electric sys
tem and the Haywards system as a feeder
to its main railroad line from Point Rich
mond. An electric railroad combination of
this kind would g\ve the Santa Fe sys
tem access to the most populous portions
of Alameda County without the necessity
of construction of expensive pieces of
roadway and the securing of expensive
rights of way until their freight traffic
shall require It.
But when the promoters of the new elec
tric road are questioned about this they
merely say that they are ready to build
the road; that It will be patterned after
the Haywards road and that is all.
Belief That Santa Fe Will Utilize
This and the Haywards Line
for Access to Ala

you will have a most enjoyable time and you will be doing. an act of charity by
attending the big show in the Grand Opera House next Friday: afternoon. The
stage managers of the benefit are George Lask, Harry Orndorff, H.'A. Cripps, John
Morrisey and Phil Hastings. They meet to-morrow afternoon to/ make arrange
ments for the programme, but they have already given out a line on the treat
they have in store for those who will attend.
In the first place, It is more than possible that the first part of the perform
ance will be a minstrel show. "Teddy" Hartman, Mathews and Bulger, Gilbert
and Goldle will be the funny end men and Edv.-in Stevens will be the interlocutor.
During this act Maude Courtney will sing some 'of' those patriotic songs that she
has made such a hit In, and pretty Annie Lichter wlllalso grace the 'stage.* The
Columbia Theater will send a representative,' and though Henry Miller has ; not
bjeen seen as yet by the managersof , the benefit, it Is certain that he will consent
to give a little sketch. Florence Roberts and White ..Whlttlesey will 'present 'a
scene from "Romeo and Juliet," and hosts of good people" will appear to' make' the
programme one of the strongest that has ever been, given in California! *'.' The
Theatrical Employes' Protective Union met yesterday and to show that they
were right in line, communicated with the management of the benefit and offered
their services for the afternoon free. They recognized the brave act of hero
Sweeney and want in some way to pay their respects to his unselfish bravery.
The box office of the Grand Opera House will open at 9 a. mr Tuesday and
those who have purchased tickets will b'e i able to exchange them for reserved

Solemn and impressive were the
funeral ceremonies "held over the re
mains of ,the late James I. Jamison,
under the auspices of California Par
lor, X. S. G. W., at the hall on Mason
street yesterday afternoon. Several hun
dred members of the order gathered to
pay the last tribute to one who in life
was a zealous worker In its behalf, and
the hall was filled with many other
friends of the deceased bent on the same
sorrowful errand. The ceremonies were
conducted entirely by the officers of Cal
ifornia Parlor, who were seated In their
respective chairs of honor.
Louis Lacaze, president of California
Parlor, read the regular funeral ritual of
the order, assisted by "W. D. Hobro, first
vice president; J. F. Lenihan, second vice
president; W. E. Rowlands, third - vice
president, and Remberg Jansen.past pres
ident. After the singing of "One by One",
by the Knickerbocker Quartet the sor
rowing widow and other relatives took
seats near the . bier and the invocation
was read by -jfr. Lacaze, with responses
bv the officers. The quartet pang "Rock
of Apes'* and "Abide With Me,* which
Kinging was followed by a beautif ul
eulogy delivered with deep feeling by E.
â¢'â¢We are gathered here," said Mr. Wolf,
"to express the sentiments we feel on thl3
sad day. No one who has ever sworn al
legiance to the order of Native Sons was
more warmly enshrined In the hearts of
Us members than he who lies here before
vou and for whom we sincerely mourn.
He was for twenty years a valued mem
ber of the organization. He was * past
president of California Parlor, president
of the California Camp of the Argonauts
and at the time of his. death assistant
errand secretary- The best efforts of his
short life were given to the upbuilding of
an organization which we so deeply cher
ish. We feel the loss of a wise counselor
who has gone to meet his reward for a
life well spent. He dies, but his memory
still lives and his legion of friends will
ever bear testimony to the sterling worth
and character of James J. Jamison,, whose
pood deeds will live."
The quartet sang "Nearer, My God, to
Thee," and the exhortation was delivered
by Remberg Jansen/ The members of
California Parlor took a last look at
the remains of their departed comrade
and the casket was then borne to the
hearse by Pallbearers John McDougall,
John Grady, Henry Lunstedt, James
O'Dwyer, Charles H. Smith, I. Gurman

playing. The members of the regiment

Officer Sullivan, who is considered one
of- the. beat nthletes. in the department,
led thÂ» race after the fugitive. Cav
anaugh followed closely and the trio rush
ed over several streets, finally returning
to the corner of Montgomery and Sacra
mento. ; There Sullivan caught the man
and attempted to stop his flight. The ex
convict at once turned on his captor and
gave battle. Sullivan had Â¦ no club and
was obliged to fight with his bare fists.
The struggle lasted some time and finally
Santry -was knocked to the ground by a
well directed blow from the 'officer. HÂ«
waa picked up and returned to the station.
His ' face gives . evidence , of â¢ a\ severe;en
counter^ but -the officers received only
a - few minor, bruises. ,". / " *
Officer Cavanaugh at once started the
prisoner' for. the California-street Police
Station.' Santry became abusive on the
way and gave the officer a : great deal of
trouble. He did not, however, make any
attempt to escape until the door of the
station was reached, when he dealt Cav
anaugh a severe blow which almost
stunned him for a second. 'Then the crook
made a , break for liberty. 'Â¦' j
,The police were immediately informed
and the work of locating the perpetrators
of the crimes commenced. Suspicion was
directed to Joseph Santry. who has served
time in the StatePrison for numerous of
fenses, and later In the day the officers
obtained positive evidence that he waa
the guilty party. Last night about' 9
o'clock Santry waa arrested > by Sergeant
of Police James Donovan and Orflcer
James Cavanaugh on 1 Kearny street.
Early yesterday morning two bold burg
laries were committed in the commercial
section. The saloon of Gus 'Wiloh at Com
mercial and Davis streets was broken Into
and about the same time the door of an
other saloon at Drumm and Commercial
streets was forced and the place entered.
The crooks who committed the job se
cured but little in -either place and the
total loss will only reach $50.
Two policemen, David V. Sullivan and
James Cavanaugh, had' a desperate en
counter last evening with Joseph Santry,
an ex-convict, .who was- wanted on sus
picion of having committed two early
mc.iilng burglaries in the commercial dis
trict. The prisoner at flrat assaulted one
of his captors a*nd broke away. He waa
pursued several blocks before being cap
tured and at Sacramento and Montgomery
streets a fight for life commenced, but
the criminal was at length subdued by
a blow from* Sullivan which brought him
to the ground and he was placed behind
the bars, his name having been registered
on the detinue book.

back door of the Cederberg domicile and
found the place full of smoke.
"No burglar yet in my experience," he
said, "has tried to conceal his work by
setting flre to the house he has robbed.
There are strange features in this case.
When I first examined this woman I look.
ed closely at her neck and found no
scratch there. Fifteen minutes later I
looked again and found the Bkin scratch
ed, as If by a finger nail. She says she
was struck on the head and stunned. I
could find on lump or bruise on her head,
Patrolmen Pierec of the Seventeenth
street police station was the first officer
to arrive on the scene. He notified Lieu
tenant Anderson and the latter at once
detailed detectives to investigate the case.
Fire Marshal Towe was soon on the
scene and conducted an investigation af
ter his own peculiar fashion. He arrived
at the conclusion early in the evening
that the house had not been burglarized
In the usual way and was rather Inclined
to cast strong suspicions upon Mrs. Ross.
"I alone knew about the money. Not
even my wife knew how much I had or
where I kept it. Yet it seems strange that
it is gone, for whoever took it must have
known exactly where. to get it. I cannot
offer any explanation to-night; none what
ever."
Cederberg Is Mystified.
bears a good reputation in the com
munity.
"I cannot say how this all happened,"
he paid calmly. "We went to church at
7:30 o'clock, and the nursegirl and baby
stood at the window to wave us good-by.
Mrs. Ross has lived with us four months,
and haa always bohaved herself very
well. She had no gentlemen callers, and
was devoted to our baby. I paid her $5
per week. To-morrow she was to have
received the usual amount, and waa look
ing forward to getting it so that she
-could go home and spend the day with
her own babies, for she has two of them."
Mrs. Ross is 22 years old and is the
daughter of Frank Lopaz of 817 Vallejo
street. She has been a widow for eight
months and has two young children, who
live with her parents.
Chief of Police Sullivan has detailed de
tectives on the case to aid the Fire Mar
shal in his investigations.
Mrs. Whitehead, who lives in the lower
fiat, says that she heard some one knock
ing on the wall for several minutes before
she was warned that the building was on
fire, but paid no attention to It. because
she thought it wae her next door.neigh
bor. When Mrs. Ross was carried down
stairs she was crying, according Â¦ to Mrs
Whltehead's etory, "Oh, my head! My
head!" Mrs. Whitehead says She did not
hear any one enter the door leading to
the upper flat.
The fear stairway could be reached from
five different directions through adjoining
lots. Any one might have gone up that
way without attracting the attention of
the people in the lower flat, and might
have forced the rear entrance without
awakening any one up stairs or down.
George H. Bartlett, who was. one of the
trio of men who released Mrs. Ross, was
too excited to remember much as to how
she was tied. He firmly believed \ her
story, however. '
Believes Woman's Story.
and she seems to remember dlstlnctly
everything that happened.
"She says the door was left partially
ajar by her supposed assailant, and yet
the three men Â¦who first entered the room
afterward found it closed. If she had her
I right hand, free she could have loosened
the ropes, but there is no evidence that
she tried. Finally, she has only pretend
ed to be hysterical, for she has been thor
oughly alive to everything that has been
said within her hearing with regard to the
case." V:.? ,'?.-:â¢;
Cederberg and his wife arrived home
about 9:30 o'clock after the flre was out.
Going directly to the rear bedroom Ceder
berp pulled open a bureau drawer and
took out a handful of silver. He de
clared that he had been robbed of $120 m
gold and that his wife's watch, valued
at $35. was also missing. Cederberg Is a
bricklaying contractor, a native of
Sweden, and haa lived in this city about
five, years and in the house at 3539
Twenty-fourth street for about a year. He
Claims Hie Was Robbed.
"What struck me most forcibly was
that there was no evidence of a strug
gle. Her nightdress was drawn down to
her ankles, quite smoothlv. There can
be no doubt that the loop around her
neck was tle-ht, for her cries were in
articulate. The fact of the matter Is,
though, that we did not stop to study
the knots, but cut the ropes as quickly
as possible and curried her downstairs.
She was quite stlfl, particularly in the
lower limbs, and was hysterical.
Afterward the men turned their atten
tion to the fire, which was so closely con
fined that it did not show at first. The
door and windows of the room were
closed, and that alone prevented a bad
flre. As it was, the bed clothincr was
charred and the walls scorched. There
was a pungent odor of coal oil over the
whole place. It was evident that nearly
the whole can had been emptied on the
floor and bed. A few buckets of water
were sufficient to quench the blaze, and by
the time the Flre Department arrived the
flre was all out. ,
I could see In the half light, was tight
enough around her neck to choke her,
and her left arm was quite securely tied
to the leg of the bed. The other leg of
the bed was between her ankles, which
were rather loosely tied with a- piece of
manila rope.
MRS. LILLJAN ROSS.
A PRETTY young woman, tied se
curely with ropes, a helpless babe,
a blazing bedroom, redolent with
the fumes of kerosene, and a rifled
strong box are the elements in a mystery
that set the Mission agog last night.
Mrs. Lillian Ross is the young woman
In the case. For four months she haa
been cmploved as nurse in the family of
Mrs. E. 8. Cederberg. who lives in the
upper fiat of No. 2539 Twenty-fourth
etreet. " While Cederberg and his wife
Â¦were at church alx>ut 9 o'clock last nlgrht
pafsersby saw smoke and flames issuing
from the rear windows of the upper flat.
On breaking into the place they found a
blazing bed in a room in the flat and an
tmrty five-gallon oil can on the floor. In
a front bedroom Mrs. Ross was found
stretched on the floor at the foot of the
"bed, A piece of clothesline was tied about
her neck and her left ana was tied
eecurely to a leg of the bed by an end of
the 6ame rope. Both feet were tied to an
other leg of the bed with a piece of cheap
Manila rope. The young woman's right
arm was free and she was screaming for
help when the rescuers entered the place.
The child lay upon the bed. unharmed.
When Cederberg arrived home soon
after the fire had been extinguished, he
announced that 5120 in gold and his wife's
Â¦watch had been taken from a drawer In
the bedroom that had been eet on fire,
although ?9 In silver still remained in the
improvised strong box.
Hit Her On the Head.
Mrs. Ross cays a smooth-faced, middle
aged man tied her up, and she supposes
that he set the house on flre. Here is her
eimple story:
"Mr. and Mrs. Cederberg left the house
ot 7:30 o'clock to attend church at the
Swedish Mission Church on Jessie street.
Soon . afterward I went to bed with the
baby. I did not go to sleep, but suddenly
2 looked up to see a middle-aged, smooth
faced man enter the room. I did not hear
him enter the house, and was very much
frightened.
â¢â¢ 'I want your money,' he said. 'I have
no money,' I replied, and then he hit me
on the head with something-. I was half
stunned and could not scream.. I have an
indistinct recollection that he dragged me
from the bed and laid me on the floor,
tying: ropes around me. It was all like a
dream. Then he left the room, leaving the
door open a little ways. Pretty soon 1
smelled smoke. The rope choked me so 1
could not scream very loud, but with my
right hand I beat on the floor as hard as
I could, praying that some one down
Btairs would hear me.
"It Feemed an age before they came and
released the ropes. I did not see the man
leave the house, nor did I see him at all
after he left my bedroom. I was so choked
with the rope and my head ached so that
I did not know much that was going on.
I never saw the man before, but I would
know him again if I saw him. He was a
sort of young-old man. That is ail I
know."
Discovered by Passersby.
The building at 2529 Twenty-fourth
street is a. two-story frame structure,
rather loosely put together. There is a
front entrance, as well as a rear entrance
to the upper flat, which .has five rooms.
The lower flat is occupied by W. D.
Vhitehead and family, who first heard
of the flre from people who were passing-
In the street. The Cederbergs occupy the
Â«mlre upper flat. The room in which
Mrs. Ross and the baby were found is In
front, and has been occupied by Mrs.
Cederberg, the nurse, and the baby, while
Cederberg has been sleeping In the rear
bedroom, which was found In flames.
The two bedrooms are separated by a
square room, used as a dining- room. ThÂ©
kitchen and an extra .bedroom are in the
rear.
