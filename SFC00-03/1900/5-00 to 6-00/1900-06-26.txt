"There is an evil habit which has be
come almost a custom among our Vice
roys and Governors which must be eradi
cated at all costs. For Instance, when
ever thtse high officials have had on their
hands cases of international dispute all
their actions soem to be guided by a bo-
Hef that such cases would be amicably
arrarged'. It is our special command that
should any high official find himself so
hard pressed by circumstances that notnÂ»
ing short of -war would settle the mat
ter, he is expected to set himself reso
lutely to work out his duty tn this end.
Or. perhaps, if it be thjÂ»t war has been
already declared under " such circum
stances, there is no possible chance of the
Imperial Government" consenting to an
immediate conference for the restoration
of peace.
"It behooves, therefore, that our Vice
roys, Governors and commanders in chief
throughout the empire unite their forces
and act together without distinction or
particularizing of Jurisdiction, so as to
present a combined front to the enemy,
exhorting and encouraging their officers
and soldiers in person to fight for the
preservation of their homes and native
soil from the encroaching footsteps of tho
foreign aggressor.
"Never should the word "peace* fall
from the mouths of our high officials, noi
should they even allow it to rest for a
moment within their breasts. With such
courage as ours with her vast area, her
immense natural resources and her hun
dreds of millions of inhabitants, if only
each and all of jÂ«ou would prove hi3 loy
alty and love of country, what, Indeed, is
there to fear from any invader? Let no
one think of making peace, but let each
strive to preserve from destruction ana
spoliation his ancestral home and graves
from the ruthless hand of the invader."
SALISBURY EXPECTS
SATISFACTORY SETTLEMENT
LONDON, June 25.â Lord Salisbury is
still hopeful that the Chinese crisis wlll.be
solved without war against that country
as a' whole. In spite of the alarming re
ports he inclines to the belief that tfte
Government of China in some satisfactory
form will shortly be able to reassert Itself.
He does not mean that he belittles the
professions of the various Viceroys, who
have given notice of their willingness to
co-operate with the united forces. With
out committing himself to a definite view
of the future, he appears averse to any
scheme of territorial indemnity which,
when order is restored, might be suggest
ed by the powvrs who have sufferer' Jur-
Irg the uprinir.g.
The intervlrv/ of the United States Kvn
bassudor. Joseph H. Choate. with Lord
Salisbury on Saturday was due to instruc
tions leceivcd from Secretary Hay, In
which the Embassador was notified of tho
friendly professions of the various Vlce-
sul General Gocdnow proved the unrelia
bility of these reports by stating that not
a word had been received in Shanghai
from Peking since June 14.
The authorities do not know, therefore,
if the foreign Ministers in Poking de
manded their pas-sports, and doubt if they
would take such action without first con
sulting their Governments. The authori
ties here are sparing no pains or expense
to get in communication with Vice Ad
miral Seymour's column at Peking, and
arc hopeful that Admiral Kempff will be
able to obtain trustworthy InformatiTO
within a few days.
By Wednesday it is expected that the
first troops will sail from Manila, and oth
ers will be sent as rapidly as possible to
Taku until a sufficient force has been
gathered there. General MacArthur was
directed by cable to-day to send a. supply
of ammunition and rapid-fire guns to
Tak,u. The collier Scindia Jias been di
rected to proceed at once from Gibraltar
to Mar.Jla. 'â¢,
"There is no foundation in the report
that the 'North Atlantic squadron is be
ing prepared, fqr war." said Secretary
Long this afternoon. "Men and not ships
are needed In China, and I am confident
that the International situation is not
such' that there will be a clash between
the powers."

CHEFU, June 25, via Shanghai.â United
States Consul John Fowler has received
from Rear Admiral Kerapff the following:
Â¦' "Only one communication from- Peking
has reached me since communications
were interrupted ' on ; June 10. It was
dated June 12. - No direct or Indirect news
from' the 'Ministers since.
"About 450 foreign troops. Including 56
American marines, went to Peking to
guard the legations. A force of 100 Amer
icans, with a total force of 2500 men of
all nationalities represented here, went
on June 10 to open the road and to relieve
Peking. This movement was by permis
sion of the Chinese Government.
"The latest news from the expedition
was dated June 12, when the expedition
was at Lang Fang. . The railroad has
been destroyed behind it since. .
"Any news that can be obtained or ef
fort . made for the relief of the legations
and the lives and property. of foreigners
should be done at any hazard. All ener
gies and forces here must first be directed
to the relief of Tientsin, particularly, as
it is the key to Peking."

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON. June 25.â In view of the latest
developments in China new and
specifrt significance is attached by
officials of the State Department to the
decrees issued several months ago by thÂ«-
Empress .Dowager, Inaugurating a new
policy of resistance against the territorial
encroachments of foreign powers. These
decrees have an Important bearing in in
dicating the responsibility of thejmper.al
Government, which has been strenuously
denied by subordinate Chinese officials for
the Taku and Tientsin disturbances.
In the imperial decrees Viceroys- and
Governors of the maritime and Yangtze
Kiang provinces are instructed to resist
by force of arms any aggression by for
eign governments, and to declare war
upon any power attempting to take pos
session of territory within their jurisdic
tion. This is a translation of one of the
decrees which was issued by the Tsung Li
Yameh:
Proclaim war if Kecassary.
"As the Italians have not Ijad their am
bitions gratified In respect to the cession
of San Mun Bay to them it is apprehend
ed that they may try to seek an oppor
tunity for seizing other portions of our
coast.
"Moreover the arbitrary and aggressive
actions of the French at Kuang Chau.
where they are stirring up disturbances
in order to obtain further pretexts, for
demanding concessions from the imperial
Government, may lead to actual hostilities
between China and France.
"It behooves us, therefore, to exercise
the utmost vigilance and watchfulness to
guard against sudden aggression and to
be always prepared to resist an enemy.
Tour Excellency is, therefore, urged to
enjoin all this upon the generals and com
manders of troops garrisoning important
points within your jurisdiction; and not
only this, but to be prepared also to give
aid to your brother Viceroys and Gover
nors whose territories adjoin your own.
"It has been an evil practice among
high provincial authorities to
that the duty of any of them lies only in
guarding safely the region lying within
his own jurisdiction, ignoring a crisis that
may be taking place in the next adjoining
province, forgetting that his neighbors,
being overcome, his turn for overthrow
becomes a near possibility. This lack of
union is lamentable, but It must not be
continued from this date.
"This Yamen has received special com
mands from her Imperial Majesty the
Empress Dowager and his imperial Maj
esty the Emperor to grant you full lib
erty and powers to resist by force of arms
all aggressions upon your several Juris
dictions, proclaiming a state of war, if
necessary, without first asking for ! n
structions from Peking, for loss of time
may be fatal, to your security and enable
the enemy to make good his footing
against your forces. Finally, your Excel
lency will be held responsible for any rep
etition of indecision or too great trust
fulness in declarations of an encroaching
enemy, such as happened, for Instance,
to General Chang Kao Yuan In Shan
tung."
. General Chang was In command of the
Tslngtao forts when the German fleet
seized Klaochau Bay, and was beheaded
for his action In surrendering them to the
invaders.
Another decree issued by the Empress
Dowager was addressed to Viceroys. Gov
ejrnors.* Tartar generals and provincial
commanders in chief. Its purpose was to
lnttame the patriotism of the Chinese with
a view to uniting the country against for
eign aggression. * -

With Taku Must Be Maintained.
LOXDOX, June 26, 3:35 a. m. â The British tcraiser Terrible has arrived at Chefu from
Taku with the latest news, which is as follows: Eight hundred Sikhs antf 200 Welsh Fusi
leers have effected a junction with the American, German and Russian forces which had
been cut off by the Chinese about nine miles from Tientsin. It was proposed to deliver an assault
upon the Chinese forces at Tientsin Sunday night.
It is not clear what forces united. It would seem that one relieving force, cut off, had
been relieved by another. At any rate it is apparently certain that the allies arrived in sufficient
force at Tientsin Sunday to attack the besieging Chinese.
"Foreign official opinions here," says a dispatch from Shanghai to the Daily Express,
dated yesterday, "incline to the belief that the worst has happened to the legations at Peking and
to Admiral Seymour. Even if the legations were safe oh June"' 19 there is no guarantee that they
are safe now. The situation, in fact, grows more and more gloomy. The entire absence of reli
able news from the capital seems to justiiy the worst construction which can be put upon it. .
"Bad news comes from Nanking, where the unrest is said to be growing hourly. Viceroy
Liu Kin Yih has telegraphed the British authorities that he has ordered the five Chinese cruisers
which have been lying off the harbor here to proceed to Xanking."
"General Ma's army," says a correspondent at Shan Hai Kwan, "consisting of 4000 men,
left a week ago for Peking, and General Sung Ching's troops, numbering 2500, left for the same
place on June 15.
"A careful estimate of the number and armament of the Chinese troops around Peking
puts the total at 360.000, and it is calculated that these troops possess 220 7-centimeter Creusot
guns, 18 Krupps and 150 Maxims. Their supply of ammunition is practically inexhaustible. It has
been mainly supplied by a German firm at Carlowitz. Fully three-fourths of. the Chinese forces
are badly drilled, wholly .undisciplined and quite unfamiliar with modern weapons."
Another Shanghai dispatch says: "Li Ping Heng, former Governor of Shantung, who is
intensely anti-foreign, has gone to the Kiang Yin forts on the Yang-tse. He has declared his
intention of resisting the landing of British forces in that region."
According to a Hongkong dispatch dated yesterday strong reinforcements of Indian police
with three Maxims have been sent to Kowloon, on the mainland. A Chefu message of Mon
day's date says: . >.
Four cannons have been added to the west fort here, where there are now iooo soldiers
permanently encamped, a further force having arrived from Ning'Hai Chou. There is an uneasv
feeling prevailing here, and an attack is generally anticipated. Chinese merchants are closing their
offices and preparing to leave the port. All business is at a standstill."
Extensive preparations by the allies are going forward. The first regiment of British In
dia's 10,000 men embarked at Calcutta yesterday, and 833 more marines received orders to go out
The British War Office, in anticipation of a prolonged campaign, is contracting for winter
The Amur Army Corps, ordered out by Russia, numbers 52,100 men, with 84 guns. Japan
proposes to land 15,000 men on Chinese territory within a fortnight.
Among the minor military preparations the Portuguese Governor of Macao, island of
Macao, at the southwest entrance of Canton River, is sending arms to the Portuguese in Canton.
The Germans in Hongkong have cabled Emperor William to ask if they may serve in the local
forces in defense of Hongkong.

TIENTSIN. WHERE THE FOREIGN POPULATION IS BESIEGED BY THE CHINESE.
The above plan of the foreign concessions In Tientsin Is taken from a recent directory of the Far East.
OnlT a small part, the western of the German concession, which extends almost three-quarters of a mile farther to the
right, is shown on the plan. The Chinese city, containing. It Is said, over 1,000,000 of people, lies to the south and east of
the European quarter and on the west of the grand canal. The railroad station lies on the north side of the riven where
is also a large Chinese population. It Is said that all the foreign residents are gathered within the compound of the Brit
ish consulate, which, being surrounded by a high wall of heavy masonry, offers better facilities for defense than anyother
place, and are there fighting against an Innumerable horde of Chinese soldiers and Boxers until a relief column shall reach
them'from Taku. Tientsin is already Infamous to Europeans from the frightful massacre of the French Sisters of Mercy
and other foreigners on June 21. 1870. when the most appalling brutality was exhibited by the Chinese.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON. June 25.â China's appeal for
an armistice until LI Hung Chang
can reach Peking has been denied
by the powers. Secretary Hay has
notified the Chinese Minister. Wu Ting
Fang, and It Is understood similar notifi
cation has been given by the European
powers to the representatives of China ac
credited to them that there can be no de
lay In the dispatch of troops to Peking.
Orders i to all foreign commanders are ex
plicit. Peking must , be occupied as soon
as possible and communication between
the capital and Taku maintained. There
is a disposition here to regard the appeal
of the Viceroys for a cessation of opera
tions by the allied forces as a move on the
part of the Chinese officials to secure de
lay. In the hope that it will benefit them
selves as well as their country. The rul
ing dynasty In China belongs to an alien
race â the Manchus, who several centuries
ago were called upon to aid the Chinese in
resisting an enemy and who occupied the
capital and have -since held it. Li Huns
Chang and the Viceroys who have ap
pealed to the United States, Japan and
Europe are Chinese, and it would not be
surprising; according to diplomats here, if
they should be seeking to turn the Gov
ernment of China over, to the Chinese.
The United States, however, does not in
tend to await the pleasure of subordinate
officials, notwithstanding 'their assertion
that if. foreign troops continue their opera
tions they will not be responsible for the
consequences.. The Empress Dowager and
Emperor are recognized as the ruling pow
ers of China, and it Is to the interest, of
this, as well as other civilized govern
ments, that there should be some central
authority with which the powers can
treat.
Hopes In Li Hung Chang.
Great hopes are placed In the proposed
visit of Li Hung Chang to- Peking, not
only because'of his influence with the Em
press Dowager, but because he can prac
tically control the imperial: troops, which
are believed to be engaged In the opera
tions against . .Tientsin. Most ! of these
troops come from the province where Li
Hung Chang's home Is situated, and it Is
recalled that during the Chino-Japanese
war his Influence prevented their depart
ure for the front. With the imperial
troops under his orders he will be strong
enough to put pressure upon the central
Government which it Is. expected will re
sult in the restoration of peace.
While declining- to refrain from dispatch,
ing troops Into Northern China, the pow
ers will respect the wish of the Viceroys
of the. southern. provinces, especially those
of the Yang-tse-Klang region, that gun
boats bet not sent up the river or troops
ordered into that section. . The Washing
ton Cabinet first granted this request, .and
Japan and the European powers have con
curred In the assent. The' one condition Is
that order must be preserved in the region
or the powers will feel it advisable to send
troops there. ' ;-

Long to-day approved the findings of the
naval board recommending that three of
the rive new battleships shall be built with
superimposed and waist 8-lnch turrets and
that the remaining two of the new bat
tleships shall have quadrllaterally ar
ranged S-inch turrets.
Â¦This turret question has been a source
of lively controversy in naval circles and
after the regular naval board of construc
tion, conFistlng of the bureau chiefs, had
passed upon it a special board was cre
ated, made up of line and staff officers of
recognized ability on questions of naval
construction, to consider it. The chief
division was as to retaining the superim
posed turrets, as on the Kentucky and
Kcarsarge, or going back to the system
of placing turrets quadrilaterally. fÂ«o as
to fire In broadsides, pn this the board
divided, seven favoring the superimposed
turret*, while five were for quadrilateral
turrets and Captain Barker favored a
compromise, building part of each type.

The police authorities are inclined to

given by Nathan J. Ferrand, a Transit
Company detective,, they may be able to
prove that at least some of the. actual

employ of that company, not at the in

enhance the reputation of the Transit de
tectives by giving them opportunities to

In summing up the contents of the af

"On the contrary," he added, "the strike
leaders and all the members of the Street

and order. The Transit Company is' not
responsible perhaps for the unsettled

ties and the agencies of the Federal Govern
ment. , -, Â¦Â¦';/
The court, in passing on the point, does not
undertake to punish If the affirmative posi
tion is sustained. The injunction proceeding
la Intended as a deterrent, a preventive of law
lessee and is a declaration and warning to all
the people. The issue set forth here is not one
between the Transit Company and the members
of the Street Car Union, but of <he United
States against the strikers and all persons who
may interfere with the operation of the mails.
Irrespective of whether or not this or that per
son hai> been BUllty of an act of lawlessness, a
reasonable apprehension as to a violation of the
laws of the United States Is practically all that
Is' necessary to determine the issuance of an
injunction.
Soop after the present strike was inaugurated
there were scenes of lawlessness throughout the
city. It is admitted that the mall cars have
been interfered with and their prompt opera
tion at times rendered impoFstble.
The defendants and those who have acted in
concert with them ordered the strike. From
this It follows that whether they are guilty
of lawlessness or not, as complained of, they
must be held accountable for the necessary con
sequences of their acts.
If it is true, and I hope It Is, that none of the
defendants has been guilty of interfering with
the mall cars, then the injunction can certainly
do no harm. However, my ruling is not based
upon that conclusion. The motion for a tem
porary injunction Is accordingly granted.
NEW YORK, June 25. â The American
Association for the Advancement of Sci

Columbia University. Two of the affili

The general session was called to order

In his address to the members of the

discover soil exhaustion, and the less of abil

As enlightenment among men advances with
the centuries we fell trees, regardless of the
consequences. Our Government policy of giv

now that reserves were not made by the Gov

BERLIN, June 25.â The Prussian Gov

conditions which fostered the local super
stition that he had fallen a victim of rit

roys and was instructed to secure Lord
Salisbury's views. Beyond casual conver
sation Mr. Choate had not mentioned the
crisis In the Far East until he received
Sacretary Hay's cable message. The Em
bassador discovered the British Premier's
views were exactly as frequently repre
sented In these dispatches. They main
tained the belief that the diplomats at
Peking had not been massacred, and did
not believe they were likely to be. He
Is eminently satisfied with the action al
ready taken by the United States, and ex
pressed the same viewp as the cable dis
patches attribute to Secretary Hay.
In short, the conference may be said to
have not elicited a single point on which
Lord Salisbury differed from the Ameri
can attitude, and while he expressed his
determination to use every endeavor to
restore order In the Peiho Valley and ex
tricate the diplomats, his estimate of the
situation was tinged with a spirit of hope
fulness that contrasted greatly with the
general tone of the British press. '/It.
The British Premier did not discuss tho
eventual settlement and the likelihood of
a partition of China, etc., and it may be
reiterated that this phase of the situation
has not yet been made the subject of an
exchange of views between any of-the na
tions. Judging from the account of what
passed between Mr. Choate and Lord
Salisbury the .statement recently made
to the Associated Press by the Foreign
Office that Great Britain and the other;
nations, so far as the Foreign Office knew,
were confining all their energies and de
liberations solely to the present predica
ment, is a sincere statement of fact. If
Russia, Japan or any other power has an
ulterior object in making capital out of
the trouble in China, Lard Salisbury does
not appear to be aware of It.
FACTS ARE PLACED
IN A FALSE LIGHT
BERLIN, June 23.â The Kreuz Zeitung
warns the public against crediting dis
patches from Chinese officials, especially
those from Sheng, director of telegraph
and railways. The recent optimistic ut
terances of the French Foreign Minister,
M. Delcasse, were founded upon one of
Sheng's cablegrams that has since been
proved false. .
The paper further complains that all re
cent Russian communications place the
facts In a false light, and Instances a
statement by the Official Messenger of
St. Petersburg: which represents the Box
ers as the only disturbers and the Chinese
Government as innocent. The views criti
cized do not prevail in German official
circles. The Chinese Minister here, Lu
Han Houan.'in the course of an interview
to-day, said: â¢

"The Empress cannot be deposed. Chi
nese piety would not permit dethronement.
But perhaps It would be possible through
friendly means to intimate to the old Em
press that she should abdicate after hav
ing ruled so long. An experiment could
be made with the Emperor, surrounding
him with competent counselors, of whom
there is no lack to-day among the ChÂ»
nese." ;
* Germany will send to China all available
vessels besides those already, there.
LONDON, June 25.â The Admiralty has
received the following dispatch from Rear
Admiral Bruce, dated Taku, via Chefu
June 24:
"The total-force-, which left Tientsin
with the Commander in chief .for Peking

LONDON, June 26,' 4:20 ''a. m.â Lord
Roberts' six columns are converging, ap
parently, so aÂ£ to close in upon the Free
Staters, although decisive results cannot
be expected for several days. A number
of Boers who were supposed to be within
the wide-flum? net have broken â or rather
stolenâ through General Rundle's Ficks
burg-Senekal lines, t ;'Â£Â¦â¢Â¦
The Canadians were engaged in the
Honingspruit fight last Friday 1 . General
Dewet's men first cut off a Canadian out
post of mounted rifles at dawn, two being
killed. Lieutenant Trlglis and four others
were wounded and three were captured.
The Free Staters then attacked the
camp, where there were fifty Canadians
and two companies of Shropshire*,
though without much effect, as the men
were well entrenched..
The foreign military attaches who were
with Lord Roberts are now in Cape Town,
en route for Europe. United States Con
sul Hay of Pretoria is going to Machado
dorp in the interest of the British prison
ers and to see President Kruger. Â¦
Eighty Hollanders have been lodged In
jail at btanderton for destroying property
prior to the British occupation. The wives
and children of the Boers are surprised
that the British do not loot, but pay for
what they get.
The Boers derailed a construction train
near Standerton June 24. Two trainmen
were killed and four badly hurt.
A party of Brabant's Horse, near Flcks
burg. saw a camp of khakl-clad men and
walked in, only to find themselves among
the Boers. The visitors surrendered.
The Lourenzo Marques correspondent of
the Times telegraphing yesterday says:
"The Boers are losing a large number of
horses from the cold and from lack of
food, and the survivors are in a miserable
condition. The inadequacy of the lioer.
commissariat is telling. on the burghers."
The Times editorially adopts the "sug
gestion of a correspondent that Johannes
burg should be the capital of the Trans
vaal colony," "because the traditions of
Pretoria are corrupt."
The following: dispatch has been re
ceived at the War Office from Lord Rob
erts:
PRETORIA. Presidency, June 25. â Clements

near Wynburg, where he had gone to pick up

It my duty to Buffering humanity to say, a

In a letter dated January 1, 1300. Mr. At-

with Peruna:
" Her case had baffled the skill of
some of the most noted physicians.
One of her worst troubles was chronic
constipation of several years' standing.
She also suffered with general debility
and paroxysms^ â sometimes as often as six
or eight times a day.
"At this tim<? she was passing through
that most critical period in the life of a

JOCKEY WINS
APPLAUSE BY
HIS GAMENESS
Henry Austin Adams lectured in Met
ropolitan Temple last evening under the
auspices of Pioneer Council Xo. 1 of tho
Young Men's Institute. His theme was
"The Twentieth Century." The hall was
filled. Hon. Morris M. Estee presided. Be
fore the lecture Miss . Timmins and
Messrs. Stantlna and Martinez supplied
a very agreeable musical programme,
vocal and instrumental.
Mr. Adams attacked many existing con
ditions. He said at the outset that he was
an optimist and that he believed because
he was an American and, more especially,
because he was a Catholic, that things
would come, out all right after a while.
The twentieth century would be just
what the people of the present made of it.
The raDid movements of the time con
vinced him that intellectual progress was
down hill. All rapid movements indicated
downward progress; upward progress was
always slow. Education was being turned
into a fad. Women's clubs were talking
culture, fie hoped that all "women who
belonged to clubs would resign to-mor
row. Short-haired screech owls were go
ing through the land saying, "For God's
sake don't be narrow." To them he would
have women answer, "For God's sake
don't be shallow."
The consensus of opinion was that the
public school system of the country was
based on a false system, the speaker said.
A recent encyclical by Leo XIII had
wisely counseled that all teaching be
based on what was solid and this coun
sel had been proven good.
"Society in San Francisco consists of a
lot of bad people, and all the outsiders
are trying to get Into it," declared
Adams. "So it is in New York. As for
Chicagoâ good God! Society is absolutely
pagran."
There was not one contented home in
the land, said Adams. Women were striv
ing for invitations from those whose
names would have caused their mothers
to blush. College life was a bestial, mal
odorous existence. The students who
tried to do right were regarded as milk
sops. Politics were a reeking mass. All
knew what Congress and Legislatures
signified â places to get rich. Men who
drew up grandiloquent political platforms
winked at one another as they schemed.
A little money brought religious paraly
sis to Catholics as to others, Adams as
serted. The men attended the sacraments
until they were rich. - Their wives, when
wealth came, liked to dine with Episco
palians and Methodists and Baptists.
They thought that they were then above
the Irish. If , they could, they Â¦would
change their names so that they wouldn't
sound Irish. If they came to church," how
they swept up the aisle! What were
Catholic millionaires - â¢ doing for the

My husband, has been dead for nine ;

The nwn have been questioning me there.
I would know the man who struck me if I
should see him again. I have, him right
in my mind. He was an American. He did
not touch my Dockptbook. I had a few
cents in my pocketbook. I did not read

saw the pictures. There was a policeman'

A Veritable Death Trap.
Daylight inspection of the premises at
3539 Twenty-fourth street shows that it
would have been almost Impossible for
Mrs. Ross to have started the lire and
then tied herself up in the fashion that
she was found, at least without the aid
of another person. Xot only was a flre
started in the back bedroom, but in the
dining room as well, for the lace curtains
on the windows have been burned away.
These curtains were fully three feet
from the door of the back bedroom. This
door was tightly closed, or the chances
are that Mrs. Ross would not have been
alive to-day to tell the story. The fact
that the bedroom fire was confined with
in the narrow â¢walls of a room 8x8 feet,
with no ventilation whatever, accounts
for the fact that it did scarcely any dam
age.
Mrs. Ross' bedroom was a veritable
trap. Once the fire got a pood start in
the dining room, she would have had no
means of escape except through a win-
dow fully twenty feet from the ground.
Nothing could have saved the upper por
tion of the house if the fire had burst
through the door of the back bedroom.
It seems unreasonable to suppose that
a woman would have taken such desper
ate chances to secure a few dollars.
Three witnesses testify that the ropes
with which she was tied were strong
enough to give her a hard tussle and
would have taken some time to unravel.
Mr?. Ross' hands are small, plump and
white, of the sort unaccustomed to hard
work. If she had been handling rough
ropes and bad cut open tha can of oil
ihat was poured over the furniture la the
uac& Detiroooi it stands to reason that tha
unaccustomed work would have left some
marK on cer tender flesh; but there were
no such marks discovered -when she was
released from her perilous position.
The can of oil that was usea bad been
left en the back veranda. The adjom
Â»ng houses are but a few feet away. They.
too, have bax:k verandas, and the people
who live in them were out and in many
times on Sunday night, Dut none saw any
light in the Ceaerberg kitchen during the
evening. The can ol oil muot have been
carneti inside 'and the top ripped neany
oft. The ropes used also came from tiie
n.ucaen.
'Xne Cederbergs were absent from, homo
nearly every Sunday night for several
hours. The head of the family always
latched the back door and earned tne
key to the front entrance with him. How
ever, it there was a burglar In the house
that nignt he mignt have got in at
the back bedroom windows, of which
there are two, both opening cut on the
sheds of the adjoining house. Cederberg
says that he found the catches of bota
windows â¢unfastened when he returned
heme that night.
ilrs. CtderDerg remembered yesterday
that she had leit J12 50 in coin with her
watch on tho bureau of her bedroom,
which the burglar must have taken.
Why the robber took this money and re
fused the $3 in silver that was in the
bureau drawer does not appear. 'Tha
chain that belonged with Airs. Cedc;-
berg"s watch was found in the watch
case, and with it a small silver time-i
piece which Cederberg said he had never
seen before. He carried the watch and
chain away with him, however.
Wlj^Was John Boss?
Just novr the detectives are trying to
find out who John Ross, who was alleged
to have been the husband of Mrs. Rosa,
was. Frank Lopaz. the girl's father, in
sists that Koss died in Sacramento before
the family removed to this city, and that
Mrs. Rose" youngest child was bom here
two months after the father's death.
Mrs. Ross Is equally positive that her
husband came here with the family ana
worked for some time at a place on Mar
ket street, and that his death occurred
in this city. The health records, however,
fail to show that any person of that namÂ«
has died in the city within the past year,
except an old man who died at the Alms
house, aged â¬S.
Mrs. Ross refused to discuss her affairs
for the benefit of the public yesterday.
"I am very tired," she said, "and
haven't had enough to eat for two dayrj.
When I get home and have some restâ
to-morrow, perhaps â I may talk to you."
She appeared perfectly self-possessed,
but complained of a bad headache, partic
ularly in the spot where she claims her
assailant hit her. After the police wera
through -with her late In the afternoon
she went to her home at S17 Vallejo
street, and there refused to be seen.

AFFAIR STILL REMAINS UNSOLVED

I do not know that there was any coal

I did not have the c&al oil can in my hands.
I was in bed at the timt*. I did not hear
until- now anything about coal oil on my

hands might have coine off the hand of
the man who tied me to the bed. The
rope with which I was tied belongs In the

Graphic Story of Alleged
Burglar's (Attack Told by
Mrs. f^oss to Captain
Seymour.
I dosed off and before I knew it a man -seas at the side of
my bed. He said, "I want your money." I said, "I haven't got
any." When he came near the bed I saw his face. He was a tall
man with blue eyes. He had no mustache and he wore a brown hat
Â¦with a wide brim. â Prom a statement made by Mrs. Lillian Boss to
Captain of Detectives Seymour.
DETEP mystery still enshrouds the
attempted burninp of the domicile
of E. S. Cederberg at 2539 Twenty
fourth street In which Mrs. Lillian
Boss was foun4 tied to a bedpost on Sun
day night. The detectives confess that
they axe completely at sea In trying: to
Â«et at the truth of the matter. The story
of the young woman that she was at
tacked by a man â¢who demanded money
and who knocked her Eenseless and bound
fcex hand and foot while he robbed the
Cederberg strongbox, seems highly im
probable, but she rticks to it and proof
is lacking to refute it- On the other hand
It seems absurd to reason from the evi
dence at hand that Mrs. Ross set the fir*
and then tied herself into what appears
to have been a veritable death trap.
Captain of Detectives Seymour has
taken a deep Interest in the case, but
fi/ter he had folio-wed every possible clew
be was obliged to confess last night that
he was no wiser than when he began.
Detectives Graham, Fitsgrerald. Byrain
and VTrer.ii worked all day in conjunction
â¢with Fire Marshal Towe, but the efforts
of the entire party were futile. The Fire
Marshal strorifrly suspects Mrs. Ross of
the crime and the detectives agree â¢with
him. but they have no evidence even of a
circumstantial nature to back up their
euspicions.
"Prove It if you can," says Mrs. Ross
defiantly, when she Is questioned as to
whether she did not set the fire. She ex
pected to be arrested and was evidently
prepared for the ordeal of a trial. But
she was not arrested. Captain Seymour
visited the Cederberg: residence in the
afternoon and took her back with him to
the City Hall, where she made a written
Etatemeat which only served to plunge
the detectives into deeper mystery- She
was perfectly calm and answered all
questions without embarrassment, but did
cot volunteer any information. Wiaen the
interview was at an end and Captain Sey
mour told her she might gx> she evinced
considerable surprise. "Do you mean that
I can go home?" she asked. "Certainly."
was the reply. "Thank you," said Mrs.
Rf>p>Â«, as she left the office.
The statement made by Mrs. Ross In full
is as follows:
Mrs. Boss' Statement. .
Mr name is Mrs. Lillian. Ross. I work
for Mrs. E. O.1<*rbÂ«:-g at her residence,
3Z2S Twenty-fourth street. My father lives
at Â£17 Vallejo street. I have worked for Mrs.
Â« "e<iÂ«Tt>erg for four months. After Mr. and
Mrs. Odfrberg Jeft the house at T.SO o'clock
last night, the baby vru sleepy, and I went
to the window with the baby to say good-
Ijy to Mr. and Mrs. Cederberg. as I gÂ»n-
eraJly do. I then rocked the baby to s'.c-ep
in the front room and put it to bed. I then
went to bed myselt The baby, Mrs. Ceder
bere and 1 all rleep in the sam-^bed. I
dozed ofT. and before I knew it a man was
at the tide cf my bÂ»Z. He sa.id: "I want
money." I fa:d: "I haven't got any."
Â¦\Vhen he came near the bed I saw his
face. He was a tall man with blue eyes.
He had no mustache, and he wore a brown
hat with a wide trim. He hit me on the
head, grabbed me by the legs, dragged me
down the bed, and tied my hands and my
feet. I lay there for a while, and -*'hen
I woke uii I smelt smoke. Then I hollered
ar.d knocked on the floor. Then the people
came and took me downstairs. I do net
krow that my nishtclothes were out of
order. When I saw the man at my bed
I did not hofler. because I was too scared
to holler. There was a small oil light burn
in? low and shaded when I saw the man.
He was bo tall that I had to look up to
eeÂ» him. He knix-k^d me sens-tless. and I
don't remember what herc^ned after he
hit me. I den't know why he did not tie
my right hand. My neck was red from the
ropes, and my shoulder v,-as bruised. 1 don't
know what he ptru<-k me with. Dr. Ander
son said he must have struck me with a
sandbag. My head ha* been dizzy all to
day, and my eyes want to close. I didn't
h.pjir him or>en the door of the room. The
door was orÂ«en a little for air. I don't know
that the front door wns open. I did not
bump my head against the bed while I was
tied. I hollered and pounded the floor when
the smoke came in. I could not loosen my
self. When I hollered, the baby began to
cry.
One Theory of the Case.
There is a bureau in the room where I
ele*;\ b'-it no money was taken from it by
the men. I don't knotv what bureau had
the money In It. The bureau that had the
raoripy in It is In the ro<->m where Mr. Oedcr
berjr sleeps. I don't know why the man
slicuM have hit me arvl tied me. and ex
posed himself to the liability of bfing
caught, when he oould as easily have taken
the money from Mr. Oederberg's room with
out disturbing me. Maybe his object was to
burn the house and me, too. I don't know
what his Intention was. I did not intend to
leave Mr. Oiderberg's employ. I was go
ine to move with them. I did not know
that they were eoins to a house where
some one committed pu'eide or murder.
They were talkinp about moving last ni^ht.
and I said I would not (t&y alone at the
new house, because I had heard that some
babies ha<3 <3ie<3 there. I toJ<i them after
ward that I would go with them.
I am ?2 years of age. I was born In Pan
Jose. CaJ. I am of Planish descent. My
father and mother are Spanish. They were
both born and raised In San Jose. I have
two children. One is 2 years old and the
other is 6 months old. My mother keeps
both of the children. I was nursing Mrs.
Oderbersr's baby. I nursed it because I
had to do something to get something to
eat. My father is out of work. My father
came to see me once at the Cederberg
house. It was about eettlns work for him.
He got a job as hodcarrier and worked
a while at that, but the work was too hard
for him. Then he worked about a. week
at dtgcls? for the same man.

to-morrow will say: Governor Theodore
Roosevelt will leave New York City next
Friday for Chicago, arriving in this city
on Saturday and leaving the same night
for Oklahoma City, where he will attend
the reunion of his old regiment, the Rough
Riders. He will not come West as the
Republican Vice Presidential candidate,
but as a private citizen, glad to meet his
soldier comrades again and be welcomed
by them. On arriving In Chicago he will
become the guest of Paul Morton, second
vice president of the Santa Fe road, in
whose car he will make the journey to
Oklahoma. _;
A year ago when Governor Roosevelt at
tended the reunion at. Las Vegas, N. M.,
Mr. Morton placed the private car at his
service and it was accepted. On the home
ward Journey from Las Vegas Mr. Morton
proffered the car for use again this year,
and the Governor accepted the tender.
His presence in Chicago, therefore, is in
keeping with his promise given in June,
1S99. Mr. Morton said yesterday:
"I have a telegram from Governor
Roosevelt in which he says that he Is cer
tainly going to Oklahoma City, but de
sires It thoroughly understood that he Is
not making a political trip, and that any
speechmaklng demanded of him will be re
sponded to only in the character of a pri
vate citizen."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, June 23.â As far as the
delegates to the National Democratic
Convention from Southern California arc
concerned they seem to be of the opinion
that neither E. E. Crandall of Los Ange
les or Mayor James D. Phelan of San
Francisco "are In the running for the
honor of Democratic national committee
man from California. They concede that
the slate is fixed and that Michael F.
Tarpey of Oakland will succeed J. J.
Dwyer. Former Senator Stephen M.
White and R. F. del Valle, the delegates
from this end of the' State, will leave for
Oakland on Thursday night's owl. Mrs.
White will accompany her husband to
Kansas City, the entire party leaving for
the East Friday morning. Neither White
nor Del Valle Is impressed with the
candidacy of Charles A. Towne for Vice
President. While Towne may be popular
with certain Silver Republicans Demo
crats feel that a Democrat can be found
within the party who will he more ac
ceptable. Judge J. Noonan Phillips, who
will head the Silver Republican delega
tion, also will leave for Kansas City
Thursday. Tire lines are more sharply
drawn this year between Sllverltes and
Democrats, hence Phillips says his crowd
will herd by Itself. Phillips is not enthu-
Fiastic over the nomination of Bryan and
he does not think the Minnesotan will be
Bryan's running mate.

COL. ROOSEVELT
WASHINGTON. June 25.â The Post to
morrow will print an authorized state
merit from Representative Grosvenor 01
Ohio, in reply to the statement by Mr.
Quipe, the New York member of the reso
lutions committee of the National Repub
lican Convention, denying certain allega
tions of Mr. Grosvenor of mutilation of
the Republican platform by Mr. Quigg.
Grosvenor's statement is as follows:
I have read Mr. Qulgre*s statement. I hold
in my hand the original document which was
handed over to him, with certain Interlinea
tions of no very material Importance, but
which required the redrafting of one entire
page and a part of another. Otherwise It was
the platform agreed upon by the committee
and the sub-committee and no man connected
vilth the transaction will put his name to any
statement contradicting mine. It is in my
possession, having been handed to me by Sen
ator Foraker after he recovered It from Mr.
Quigg the day following the action of the con
vention on the platform. It contains inter
lineations In the handwriting of Senator For
aker and others. It contains the extract JYom
the message of the President of the United
States proclaiming: the policy of the Republi
can party In the matter of the government of
the islands. It contains a plank distinctly pro
claiming the policy of the Republican party
in the matter of legislation In reference to cur
island possessions In the words I wave in my
letter to the New York Journal, .'t contains
a direct approval of the policy of legislation In
favor of the merchant marine of the country,
all of which Is omitted from Mr. Qulss's t>lat
fcim.
I had thia document when I made the state
ment to the New York Journal unj t had the
positive evidence of the truth of every state
ment I made, and any one so Â»leÂ»lnn* can
come to me and examine- the documentary evi
dence to which I have referred, whUh will
convince any man of the truth of my state
ment. I have the statement of Senator Fair
banks, which does not say anything. It is not
a Question of whether he approved of the
change of the platform or not; It Is a question
or whether or not the revision which Mr.
Quigg calls the rewriting of the platform by
him changed the whole character of the docu
ment. I refer to one single statement of Mr.
QuIkk, and that was that the' platform was
considered to be too long. The platform as
handed over to Mr. Quigg contained 2000 words;
the platform adopted as written by Mr. Quigrg
I shall have nothing more to say about this
matter. The document is in my possession at
this date and will be retained by me until I
can return It according to my promise to Sen
ator Foraker. The Republican party will not
be t-eriously affected by the matter, for the
reason that we have the two great speeches
delivered in the convention and will have the
letter of the President accepting the nomi
nation.
Mr. QuiKg's statements In regard to myself
are matters of the most vital Importance to
me. and the controversy ends right here and
now.
Convention at Kansas
City.
ANTI-IMPERIALISTS
MAY FORM A PARTY
Await the Action of the Democratic
NEW^ORK, June 25.â Anti-imperialists
to the number of thirty-live from the
principal cities of the country met to-day
at the Plaza Hotel to determine what ac
tion the followers of this line of national
policy shall take' in the coming campaign.
As a result of the conference it ts probable
that a new party will be formed, the mem
bers of which will vote independently of
both the Republican and the Democratic
parties.
A resolution was unanimously passed
directing the executive committee of the
Anti-Imperialist League, under the aus
pices of which to-day's meeting was held,
to call a general conference or conven
tion of antl-imperiallsts to consider a plan
of campaign. This will not be issued until
after the National Democratic Convention
at Kansas City, and probably will be for
a date early in August.
The resolutions state that the call Is to
be issued "to the* end that we may carry
into effect our condemnation of the Impe
rialistic policy of the present administra
tion."
Speaking of the conference and its prob
able result, Chairman Smith of Chicago
said to-night:
"We do not want to form an Independent
party unless the action of the Kansas City
convention makes It necessary. Until the
convention at Philadelphia the Republican
party had never made a party stand on
the question, of anti-imperialism. When
they adopted their platform we saw that
we had nothing: to hope from that organi
zation."

A document was read to the court in
which Keifgeber glorified the idea of the

which was secret, was devoted to hearing
the statement of the police who had un
earthed the data upon which the Indict
ment was founded. The trial was last for

BODIES FOUND
IN THE WRECK
CHICAGO, June 25.â Martin B. Madden of Chicago, who was a member of
the committee on resolutions at the Philadelphia convention, said to-day that it
was he and not Lemuel E. Quigg who substituted the word "Isthmian" for
the word "Nicaragua" In the national platform.
Mr. Madden frankly admits that he alone Is responsible for the change In
the canal plank, and does so In Justice to Mr. Quigg. another member of the
committee on resolutions, who has been charged with eliminating the specific
term "Nicaragua."
ADMITS THERE WAS A CHANGE.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO. June 25.-Lemuel Eli Quigg, the well-known New York politician,
brought cult in the Superior Court to-day against the Chicago Times-uer
nld for libel, placing the damages at $100,000. The article on which the
libel is based was printed in the Times-Herald on Sunday morning Minder
a Washington date. In which it was implied that Quigg received for
placing the word "Isthmian"' in place of the word "Nicaragua" In the Republi
can platform at Philadelphia, The inference is that he was in the employ as
attorney of a corporation seeking aid from the Government for constructing a
canal, and the change In the platform was made to satisfy his clients and raaxe
It eii^icr to carry out their project. *
NEW TORK, June Â£5.-Lemuel E. Quigg. who was the New York member or
the committee on resolutions, said to-day that the committee on resolutions naa
considered the canal matter in a full session, and, Inasmuch as a commission
has been appointed to survey, examine and report on the Panama route next win
ter, it had been deemed advisable to leave the matter open and declare In favor
of a canal across the isthmus, which was an indorsement of no route, but lett
tho party free to accept the best route. As to control of the canal by this
Government there was no question raised In committee.
"The phrase 'isthmian canal' was used with the draft brought from Wash
ington by Postmaster General Smith," said Mr. Quigg, "and the paragraph as
adopted by the convention was in the final draft prepared by Senator Foraker of
Ohio. I think Senator Foraker used the exact language of Mr. Smith after par-
Ing It down considerably. Of course, the original draft brought from Washing
ton was far too large and stood considerable paring."
It was said to-day that when Mr. Smith heard the platform read he was
much disgusted over the changes which had been made in it by the committee
fin resolutions. He said that It was not the platform the President wanted.

He Altered the Philadelphia
Platform.

American Consul at Madrid
Uncovers a Clever -
Swindle.
YANKEES TAKEN
IN BY SPANISH
BUNKO CLIQUE
Victims Made to Believe They Would
Share in Money Filched From
the Treasury of King
Alfonso.
WASHINGTON, June 25.â Dwlght Reed,
United States Vice Consul at Madrid,
Spain, has brought to the attention of the
State Department a clever and ingenious
swindle which has been attempted upon
various parties in this country by certain
Spanish schemers. The Consul transmits
a sample letter which was used in the at
tempt to defraud. It was sent to H. Stenl
of Buffalo. N. Y., and was signed "Louis
Samper Stenl." The writer claims and
explains a close relationship with the re
cipient of the letter.
"Louis Samper Stenl" recites a long se
ries of untoward happenings and compli
cations which only financial aid can njena-
He has come into possession of some ?6o0,
000, confessedly an embezzlement from the
Spanish Government, but In order to in
sure his money against recovery by the
officials he has deposited It in a Mexican
bank, payable upon presentation of a
check accompanied by a certain counter
sign arranged by himself and the bank.
Certain legal steps have been taken
against him, and in lieu of ready money
to- defend his part of the proceedings he
has been put Into prison and his personal
effects, Including a valise in which re
poses the "countersigned" check for his
fortune, are about to be sold at auction.
In return for timely financial aid from
his "blood relation" he promises a quar
ter of his fortune, his daughter's share or
the money during her minority and his
everlasting gratitude. His daughter Is at
a convent, and the prior is the sole othei
possessor of his secret. He asks that a
reply be Bent to Teodoro Runez, Calle de
Swivela. Chamber*, Madrid. The latter ia
a nephew of the prior but is ignorant of
the existence of the check, and the writer
therefore cautions that the answer be sent
in an envelope Inclosed within one ad
dressed to "Runez."
Similar communications have been sent
to persons all over the United States, the
writer in most cases assuming the same
name as the person addressed. During the
past year. Consul Reed says, parties have
come from Boston and New York all the
way to Madrid, only to find themselves
victimized. The Consul has been be
sieged of late by inquiries by the recip
ients of letters asking some information
about the signers of the communications.
He has' endeavored to answer them all,
but In view of the growth of the swind
ler's overtures he finds the task becoming
great. Steps probably will be taken to
hunt down the offenders and mete out
proper punishment.

Disordered stomach Is the cause of the ma-
jority of diseases that afflict humanity. The
stomach has an important function to perform.
The first is that of nutrition, the process by
which the food Is digested, properly assimilated
and transformed Into blood, tiesue and vital
energy, and this constantly supplies the waste
tha*. is always taking place in the system, as
a result of wbat is consumed 1 In the process
of existence. When this function Is Impaired
by any one of the -diseases from which the
liver stomach and Intestines suffer, the nutri-
tion of the body Is impaired, the amount of
waste that is continually going on immediately
exceeds the quantity of nutritive matter that Is
absorbed to supply it, and, consequently, the
loss exceeds the supply, the body Is In a con-
dition of decline, health fails, emaciation oo-
curs. the blood becomes Impure and the sys-
tem Is In a condition where It readily contracts
contagious diseases, and being too weak to re-
sist, is destroyed by them. Few people are
free from some form of stomach trouble, but
scarcely two will have the same symptoms.
The^ commoner symptoms are headache, dizzl-
nese, biliousness, sour stomach. Irregularity of
the bowels, heartburn, a feeling of uneasiness.

DEALERS IN LUMBER"
PREVENTED A STRIKE
Prompt Action in Meeting the De
mand of Their Employes
Averted a Walkout. *
The threatened strike of the longshore
lumber handlers has been averted by the
prompt action of the employers in meet
ing the demands of their employes. The
lumber handlers threatened to go out on
a strike yesterday if their demands were
not acceded to and the lumber dealers met
them half way and a compromise was
effected. The lumber handlers were re
ceiving $3 a day for nine hours' work and
they thought that sum was too small for
the amount of labor they performed.
A meeting of the union was called and
the matter was discussed, at length. It
was then decided to demand $4 a day for
nine hours' work and the men were ready
to back up their demand by a refusal to
handle any more lumber. The dealers de
bated the question and fearing that the
entire lumber market would be tied up
if they did not give in, decided to give
40 cents an hour for nine hours' work and
60 cents per hour for overtime. The com
promise proved satisfactory and the men
are following their calling in a contented
frame of mind. v -

that the concussions produced by the ex

en rÂ» :SS HOBBS," presented by Hen
/rW\i rv. Miller's company at the Co-
II A V umbIa Theater last night, hard
ly comes under tho ambitious
programme definition of "comedy,"
for a decided majority of the persons In
the play do and say things which ra
| tional persons under similar circum
stances cannot be conceived as doing and
saying. The play is. in fact, a farce, with
two well written, serious scenes. Having
made up your mind to accept it as a
farce, it 1e possible to extract from it a
very pleasant evening's entertainment.
Miss Hobbs is a new woman of a very
mild type, only slightly advanced, young,
moderately clever and decidedly pretty.
She goes around proselytizing and man
ages to separate a young wife from a hus
band who boxed his wife's ears; she abo
tries to show this young wife what a
worthless- man is the aforesaid husband
by inducing the aforesaid husband to
niake love to her, the aforesaid slightly
advanced new woman. (Pardon this legal
phraseology, but English is really so poor
in pronouns.) Unfortunately (or coinci
dentally fortunately for the playwright),
the husband has a friend of the very same
name, and the advanced woman in fishing
for the former catches the latter. The
rest of the plav turns upon the compli
cations which arise from this mistake,
and everything ends happily by the
friend's converting the slightly advanced
new woman from the error of her ways.
The acting was lar superior to the play.
True, Mr. Miller himself was by no means
at his best, suffering as he was from a
violent cold, which made it impossible for
him to pitch his voice so that it could be
heard distinctly beyond the first row of
the orchestra circle. For this he apolo
gized in a neat little speech, when called
upon after the third act, and the audience
sympathized with him in the hope that
"our glorious climate" would* give him
a chance to recover during the coming 1
week. Mr. Worthing made the best of a
dry and unsympathetic part and Mr.
Courtenay played the grown-up enfant
terrible with .true appreciation. Miss
Anglin, actress as she is in
many ways, seems not yet to have laid
to heart that wise saying of Leigh Hunt's
about the relation of actor and audience:
"It is in acting as in conferring obliga
tions â one should have the air of doing
nothing for return." Miss Elliston ac
quitted herself well in a small part, but
Miss Dale shone as the bright particular
star of the evening.-
Since last season she has improved
greatly in voice, self-possession and ap
preciation of the possibilities of character
portrayal; with higher opportunities she
cannot fail to rise to higher successes.
For theatrical mercies last night re
ceived we cannot fail to be duly thankful,
but for my part I should like to see this
excellent company in something more,
Â¦worthy their powers. I wonder, too. why
the author's name is not given on the
programme. The author ls really of more
importance than the managers seem to
think. Does it ever occur to them that
he is the one person without whom there
could be no play?
I* DU PONT SYLB.
Alcazar.
The conscientious efforts of Miss Flor
ence Roberts and White Whlttlesey in the
presentation of "Sapho" keeps the Alca
zar Theater packed every night. This is
the beginning of the fourth week of this
play and the interest in It is as great as
at the commencement. The Alcazar stock
company is working smoothly and though
the Interest centers around Sapho and
Jean Gaussln still every performer's ren
dition of his or her part is highly ap
preciated. "Carmen" " will bo the next
piece produced by the company, with Miss
Roberts in the leading role.
California.
Hoyt's "A Milk-White Flag" entered
upon its second week at the California
last night. The grim satire with which
the play abounds appealed to the audi
ence and was greeted with peals of laugh
ter. Harry iiulger as the undertaKer,
Matthews as the alleged corpse and Tony
Hart as the bandmaster were inimitable.
Mary Marble as the daughter of the regi
ment was particularly effective in her
Imitation of tho precocious Infant. The
present bill will be continued all wÂ«rk
and will be followed by "A Day and a
Night," another of Hoyt's creations.
Orph-sum.
"Good things draw," as the man said
when he puffed away at a 50-cent cigar,
and there is no doubt that the Orpheum
management has one as Its bill for the
present week. The programme Is full of
lirst-class people and first-class work and
those are the good things that draw at
the Orpheum. The Four Cohans are the
cleverest group of comedians that have
appeared here on the vaudeville boards
for a long time, and they can't coma
too often to suit San Francisco. They
were called before the curtain five times
last night and received enough flowers
to load a freight car. Gilbert and Goldle
should be prosecuted for breaking the
rules and making a whole lot of new
Jokes. They are a winning team. Good
singing is always popular with Orpheum
auaiences and they get It from Carring
ton, Holland & Galpen. The Todd- Judge
family give a wonderfully clever and
original acrobatic act. Charles E. Grape
win and Miss Anna Chance appear in a
new act in which Mr. Grapewin shows his
skill and versatility as a character actor,
and the good holdovers, the musical Dale
and Sydney Deane, are as popular as
ever.
Tivoli.
Last night at the Tivoli the dainty
Japanese musical play, "The Geisha," was
revived, amid scenes of utmost enthu
siasm. Whether this was owing to tho
extreme popularity of the play Itself or
the presence of the Stan/ord Parlor of
Native Sons, who attended in' a body, or
both, may not be known; but such wel
come as was accorded to "The Geisha"
was altogether exceptional, and delightful
alike to actor and manager. The first
act closed In a perfect shower and sea of
blossoms, and curtain after curtain yet
left'the audience unsatisfied. â¢
The cast is Indeed an admirable onef and
tho principals filled- their various roles
in a thoroughly satisfactory fashion. Ed
win Stevens is an ideal Marquis -lmarl.
His is a royal humorâ an unctuous appre
ciation of the possibilities of -the part.
Helen Merrill ls charming as O Mimosa
San, but is somewhat out of voice â it
sounds a little tired. Annie Meyers has a
delightful comedy sense, quick and nim
ble, and sings sufficiently - well. Hiss
Georgie Cooper's French girl is" a clever
conception, and the various geisha ladles
and English maidens all add to the at
tractions. Tom Greene sings the Kegi
nald Fairfax part, and if Tom Greene
were as Â£ood actor as singer we should
hear an infinite deal more of him. Mr.
Greene can act, when he wakens up, and
now is the accepted time. Ferris Hart
man of course does the Chinaman in
great shapeâ perhaps there is a bit too
much Chlnnman and perhaps also local
gags are not in the best taste in this too
dainty little opera.
The play goes a little slowly yet, and
the orchestra was not In best form last
night; the song accompaniments were
even rather slipshod at tlmesl
Grand Opera-House.
The Grand Â¦ Opera-house is dark.- this
Â¦week. It will reopen on Monday next
with the new Frawley company In "The
Children of the Ghetto." Sale of seats
begins Thursday.
Fischer's Concert Souse.
The singers from the Lambardi Opera
Corripany entered upon their last week at
Fischer*s Concert-houso last night and.
In company with Slgnor Abramoff, gave
scenes from the first and third acts of the
"Huguenots" most admirably. SIgnorina
Pollettini, Slgnora Barducci, Slgnor Bar
daracco and Slgnor Abramoff also pang
solos from grand operas, in which the or
chestra accompanied the artists much
better than of late. Mabel Martin so
pmno made her first appearance here
with two of Abfs ballads. Isabella Under
wood, now an established favorite
changed her selections. Next week Miss
Underwood will sing Romeo to the Juliet
of Miss L,rma Wing, new to this city.
Last night s house was large.

Judge Cook has taken Peter McGlade's
motion for a nev.' trial under advisement.
The allegation that the Jurors were in
lluenced in arriving at. their verdict of
"guilty as charged" by certain articles
contained in newspapers found in the
jury rocm was the subject of judicial In
vestigation during the hearing of the mo
tion. When the matter was called for
hearing District Attorney Byington pre
sented affidavits sworn to by eleven of
the twelve jurors which touched on the
newspaper end of the controversy. Ju
rors Adolph Heller. J. B. Williams. F. E.
Shafcr. M. E. Willis, H. F. McGurren. C.
Musto, 13. Graves, R. J. Hancock. K.
Sachs and F. A. Guntz. by affidavit, testi
fied that they were actuated in arriving
at their verdict solely by the evidence*
introduced, and were in no way influ
enced by newspaper articles. John Cor
bett. who was not seen by the seeker ot
affidavits, was placed on the stand to
testify as to the truth of the assertions
that the jury was influenced by news
paper articles. His testimony left the
question in rather a hazy condition.
After the newspaper en>l of the con
troversy had been disposed of. Attorney
Lennon, who represents the convicted
politician, offered other arguments in
support of his motion for a new trial.
Mr. Lennon contended that his client had
been convicted of a crime which the evi
dence failed to prove. The jury founa
the accused guilty of having uttered, pub
lished and passed a forged warrant, but
the passing of the document was not
proved by the Treasurer. At the conclu
sion of L"nnon's argument. District At
torney Bylngton argued on behalf of tht.
people and the case was submitted.
Judge Cook announced that he would
decide the motion Saturday. He will
write the decision in Sonoma County,
where ho will sperd his vacation, and
forward the same to the city. It will be
Â¦formally announced by Judge Webb of
Fresno, who will occupy the bench of De
partment 12 during Judge Cook's absence.

Counsel for Wong Wai in the quarantine
contempt case was treated to a cold
shower-bath ot surprise yesterday in the
United States Circuit Court, when Dr.
Kinyoun filed his return to the order
to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt in refusing to obey
the injunction of the court restraining
him from preventing Wong Wai and other
Chinese from traveling about the city and
State. It hail not been expected that Dr.
Kinyoun would make a rta.t-footed denial
of tne facts alleged in the complaint, but
that was what he did, through his attor
neys ex-oittcio United States Attorney
Coombs and the assistants of the last
named, Marshall J. Woodworth and E. J.
Banning.
Judge de Haven occupied the bench with
Judge; Morrow and Wong Wai and the
other petitioners were represented by
James v>. Maguire. Samuel Al. Shortridge
and John Keough.
Mr. Coombs read the return of Dr. Kin
youn after Mr. Shortrlcge had read the
complaint and the artiaavits appended
thereto. The return admits that Dr. Kin
youn was served with the order of injunc
tion and was familiar with the entire
scope of the order. The other averments
of the document are that the physician
was ignorant ol* the desire of Wong Wai
to go to Eureka, Cal.; that he did not
know and never saw Wong Wai; that
since Aiay Zh he has not prevented nor
sought to prevent nor interposed any
issue or conultion in order that he might
prevent Wong Wai from passing beyond
the limits of the city of dan Francisco.
He further in the return denies having
disobeyed or Instructed his subordinates
to disobey the order of court, either di
rectly or indirectly. He .denounces the
affidavit of Wong AVai as untrue and de
nies that he attempted to prevent or pre
vented Wong Wai and others from travel
ing beyond the territorial limits of the
city of San Francisco, or that he required
a health certificate from them or from
any of them as a condition precedent to
their traveling in any part of this State
He aveis that if Wong Wai had informed
him of the refusal of the steamship com
pany to sell him a ticket for Kureka he
himself would have notified the company
that it was acting against his orders.
The chief evidence of the day consisted
of the orders issued by Kinyoun to the
Southern Pacific company and the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company prohibiting
them from selling tickets to passengers
for points outside the boundaries of this
State. This, it was contended by Mr.
Coombs, he had a right to do. Next came
affidavits from Kinyoun's subordinates
that Wong Wai had never applied to them
for a certificate and that they had never
required one from him.
Mr. Shortridpe read the affidavit from
George Goodfellow to the effect that he
had neld a conversation with Dr. Kin.
youn after the order to show cause had
been issued against the city, in which con
versation Dr. Kinyoun remarked that if
Xhe ccurt should grant the injunction
claimed by Wong AVai against the Board
of Health the whole State would be
placed under Federal quarantine.
T. H. Goodman, general passenger agent
of the Southern Pacific Company, pro
duced the order served on him by Kin
youn prohibiting the sale of tickets for
points beyond the borders of this State.
Captain Edward Goodall of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company produced a
similar order. Frank Jaynes, superin
tendent of the Western Union Telegraph
Company, declined to produce telegrams
called for In the subpena, on the ground
that they were not sufficiently identified.
He promised the court that he would pro
duce to-day such telegrams passing be
tween Kinyoun and Surgeon General Wy
man as counsel might designate by date
and description.
An adjournment was had until 11 o'clock
this morning.
Declares He Was Not Eesponsible

DISOBEYING THE
ORDER OF COURT
At the recent railroad conference held
in Nov.- York City, at which were present
representatives from all the big railroad
lines of the Kast ard West, some very
momentous subjects were discussed. Per
haps the most important matter of delib
eration which occupied the minds of the
railroad men was the proposed but yet
undeveloped scheme Tor a great trans
continental passenger association.
On account of the importance of this
Jstely hatched plan and the embryotic
etate In which It is even at the present
time no publ'.city was given to it at the
t.me cf the meeting, although a commit
tee was appointed to make an investiga
tion and call for a general meeting when
Its work was done. That this transcon
tinental association Trill be formed is con
sidered by the railrcad men as a fact cer
tain cf realization. The general meeting
will be called later In the year, and as the
representatives of ihc different railroads
v.ho will participate in the convention are
of a mind as to the utility and the neces
sity of the Fcheme from the railrcad
standpoint, there is no doubt that the
Essociaticn will fee formed.
The committee, which is to make the
necessary investigation nnd then call for
a general meeting with the avowed ob
ject of the association in vietv-, is com
posed cf the following: John Sebastian
cf the OhicaR-o-Rock Island route. II. C.
ToTnsfnd, eeo^ral passenger agent of the
-Missouri Pacific; G<?orge F. Nicholson,
passenger traffic manager of the Santa
Fe; James Barker of the St. Louis-Mis
souri: Eben MacL<eo<i. ormirinan cf the
"Western Passenger Association, and \V.
B. Knidsern of the Missouri Pacific.
The new association when formed v.-lll
reculate the entire passenger traffic
V>ufir:e5s of the country. Most of the late
conflicts between railroad companies has
been due to the unfaithful conduct of
cr.e or mere parties in a general agree
ment as to rat.es. L'nder the proposed cr
cicr cf thirds all this will be reg-ulated at
scr.cml meetings. Of course the scheme
is concocted for the protection of the
railroads. There will be few rate wars
when the association is established and
the railrcad representatives of oppssi- '
t*rnal, line? will sit down once a year at
:i jxace banquet and plan for the goci of
aif.

Suit ; on : Dupont-Street . Bonds.
Stilt was ; begun^ in the â¢ United . States
Circuit Court yesterday against the. City,
and County of San Francisco J to j recover
sums alleged to , be due on: bonds issued
for the widening of Dupont : street; now
Grant . avenue. The plaintiffs and the
sums sued for are Edward T. Morris, ex
ecutor for -T. R;. Reynolds, -$11,125; James
S.- Shapter; trustee under the deed of "A.

The liberality with which response is being made
to the fund 7or the stricken family of a local hero is
evidence that the people of San Francisco have not
forgotten that charity which marks their history.
In vain the Democrats of California put their best
men forward. The choicest bunch they can make will
not be anything more in the public eye than a tail to
the Bryan kite.
In its administration of the schools, particularly in
the issuance of certificates, the Board 'of Education
has at least one merit â it is consistent in its absurd in
consistency.
If the Chinese wanted seriously to. set the world on

Editor The Call: In your Issue of 23d
I saw a leader on "Our Export Trade," In
which you say, referring to faw material,
such as silk, wool, flax/ hemp and Jute:
"These raw materials hardly come Into
competition with home industries." Now.
in so far as flax and hemp are concerned,
such tin assertion could only be made by
one who is entirely unacquainted with the
vast liber -resources of the whole Pacific
Sfope. This fact is not at all surprising
inMh'e press, because even the State legis
lators of California and Washington
passed laws excluding the use of native
fibers in their respective State institu
tions to the benefit of Anglo-Indian jute.
Last year 1 was allowed by the State
Board of Prison Directors to experiment
with California hemp and Oregon flax
tow. The grainbags and twine made from
these fibers were simply superb, and
much better than jute manufactures.
Mr.' AT- B. Spreckels. president of the
State Board of Agriculture, told that body
that: the' sample sugar bags I submitted
to his judgment were much superior in
strength ; to anything he had seen. Our
native fibers Is a subject worthy of our
brainiest and most enterprising men.
Hoping you will pardon. me for intrud
ing at such length on your ; very' valuable
space, I remain, yours sincerely,

REGISTERED NAMESâ J. "W. C. Uv

the register. The parties complained of

why their names should not be stricken
from the register. The party making the
complaint will have to subordinate the
complaint of Illegal registration. Illegal
registration is a crime under the provi
sions' of the Penal Code of the State of
California. . - .
THE failure of spring wheat in Minnesota and the
Dakota?, with i>artial failure of winter wheat in
Indiana and Ohio, seems to make certain a
sharp and sustained rise in price. Nebraska and Kan
sas have good crops, but wheat is not a specialty in
those States, corn being their great agricultural fea
ture. But as all grain feels a rise in one, the corn
States will get a dividend out of the advance in
wheat.
_ At the present rate of rise we are likely to see dol
lar wheat by the Fourth of July. The fair average
crop in California will fortunately be caught by the
rise in first hands and the wheat ranchers will get a
much needed benefit, while our barley and oats crop
will feel the effect beneficially. It seems probable
i:6w that the United States will have but little wheat
for export, and the effect of our shortage will be felt
everywhere.
It is interesting to note that the politics of the
world is controlled by the wheat crop and the price of
bread. There is less tendency to go to war when food
is high, and therefore less of that kind of politics that
makes toward war. War is like other great human
activities. Its prevalence depends somewhat upon its
cost.
The cause of the American wheat shortage is dis
quieting, for it is drought The crops in Illinois,
Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska and all that
group of States which get their moisture from the
Great Lakes depend upon the spring thunder showers.
These distribute the moisture to the growing fields.
Its first source is the lakes. It is brought in snow in
the winter and in the November and March rains. In
its primitive physical condition that whole country
was dotted with sloughs, swarnps, ponds and Jakes.
These were the secondary reservoirs for water.
Evaporation from the Great Lakes filled them;
evaporation from them distributed the water to the
!and to supply the growing crops. The draining of
these sloughs, swamps, ponds and small lakes has
added to the area of tillable land but decreased its
fertility by destroying the secondary reservoirs. It is
this that renders crops uncertain in all that region.
It is no dream that California may be the last perma
nent wheat field in the United States, with great crops
made certain by irrigation. The storage of \ storm
waters in our mountains will make a certain supply
for such irrigation, and when wheat has ceased to be
possible in the Upper Mississippi Valley California
inay be meeting the American demand for the b'est
milling wheat in the world.
Heretofore btit little irrigation has been used on
wheat in this State, bat the methods of its application
to this crop may well be studied in view of the fu
ture of wheat.

OUR STATE SCHOOL BOOKS.
TO such bad eminence has our series of State
school textbooks been raised by its own de
merit that it has attracted notice even in New
York. This is shown by the publication in the Edu
cational Reviewâ perhaps the best magazine of its
class in the United States â of an article on this sub
ject by Mr. Richard D. Faulkner of the Franklin
Grammar School of San Francisco. This is the best
resume we have ever seen of the history of our State
textbook legislation and should be read by every
taxpayer, whether he have children in the public
schools or not.
The State textbook system of California originated
in a well intentioned attempt to rid the State from
scandals in connection with the adoption of books
published by private firms. Like all attempts to make
people moral by legislation, it is a failure.
The constitutional ..amendment upon which the sys
tem rests is, in turn, based upon a report submitted to
the Legislature in 1883 by James J. Ayjes, then State
Printer. The fallacies and miscalculations of this re
port are responsible for much of the blunder and
waste that have ensued. Ayres stated that the cost
to the State of a speller, three readers, a grammar, an
arithmetic and a history would be $i # 33Ms; that the
retail price of equally good books bought in the
open market would be $5 03, making a difference in
favor of the State of $3 64^ on every set of the seven
books. From this must be deducted 25 per cent for
purchase of machinery and for wear and tear, leav
ing still a difference in favor of the State of $3 30% on
the series.
It seems marvelous thatisuch patent misrepresenta
tions of cost of production could influence legislation,
but they certainly did, for, combined with some
"good work" by astute politicians, they resulted in the
constitutional amendment which declares that the
State Board of Education "shall compile or cause to
be compiled and adopt a uniform series of textbooks
for use in the common schools throughout the State."
Space forbids us from following Mr. Faulkner
through his clear and dispassionate criticism of all the
egregious follies that have been committed in con
nection with the publication of these books; one
specimen must suffice. "Three thousand eight hun
dred dollars has been paid for the manuscript of a
primary history, which, . though accepted, has not
been published, and for the manuscript oHhe revised
history w hi cn Â» though submitted, has not been ac
cepted." Â¦ â '
The controlling power in the State Board of Edu
cation n<5w consists of the presidents of the five State
Normal Schools, the president of the State Univer
sity and the professor of pedagogy in that university.
That is as it should be. The State has confidence in
these gentlemen; it believes they know their busi
ness or it would not have placed them where they
are. Among the many affairs which claim their at
tention none is more important than this of the State
textbooks, for the enforcement of the compulsory
education law is the duty of local boards. Mr.
Faulkner very properly calls upon the State Board
to formulate anew and better policy, looking to the
expert revision of some of the books and the substi
tution of new books for others that are hopelessly
THERE is a charming little French
subject on exhibition this week in
]Â£ the galleries, "The Musicale." by
: that clever Frenchman. V. dc
Paredcs. "The Musicale," an old Parisian
salon on tho reception day of Mme. la
Comtesse. is ft Watteau subject, treated
in Watteau fashion somewhat, and Is a
conspicuoCsly cleVer bit of painting. It
is almost a miniature, being only 10x14
inches, and contains about fifteen figures,
admirably grouped and composed. The
costume and detail are lavish and ornate,
but most deftly subordinated to the prin
cipal interest of the picture, which is
truly a small gem in its^way..
In the same gallery isr' shown a pleasing
sheep picture of C. "Westerbeck, an ex
emplar of the Dutch school. The subject
is a shepherdess and sheep returning
home over the flat Dutch meadows in the
twilight, and the painter has well caupht
the poetry and tender sadness of the hour
and scene. The picture in warm In tone
and handled in a broad and simple man
ner, which just escapes sketchinesG. The
atmosphere has the clear freshness of a
wait between showers, which the watery
'sunset mournfully foretells.
Ethel Marion Wickes shows a Cinderella
âa Cinderella in sabotsâ at least the title
thrusts itself upon one, kicks itself into
a lagsard consciousness, so to speak, with
the "unvanishing point of a Chicago sabot,
which peeps proudly from beneath the
petticoat of the little water color lady of
the shoos. Cinderella is not worthy of
Miss Wickes. Her little Irish landscape
near by fully attests that. It is unptfrdon
aWy careless in drawing and manner.
The figure is seated on the ragged edgÂ£.
of hothlng, the arm is too small and the
background appears as if drawn from a
photographic scene.
Charles Warren Eaton shows three
landscapes, two snow scenes and an even
ing subject. The latter is a delightful bit
of color, rich and subdued, the aftermath
of a sunset and the handling is especially
happy The snow pictures offer curious
contrast to the brilliant California land
scapes around them and are full of queer,
ghostly suggestion. *
In another gallery is a curious study of
sea and sand dunes by Mary C. Brady.
As the phrase goes, there is "something
to It," but it is a little difficult to decide
what. It is certainly not the sea, which
Is entirely without drawing and resembles
nothing so much as a disturbed mass of
cotton batting; nor is it the Immediate
foreground, which, according to the treat
ment. Is farther away than the middle
distance; it must therefore, be the sunny,
forceful middle distance itself and a cer
tain curious color harmony throughout.
The style Is the most outre impressionism,
and almost anything might be prophesied
of its painter. If there were more mys
t'-ry in the method, if one could not so
plainly "see the wheels go rqund" at any
point within the half-mile range these at
tempts at texture and atmosphere would
be of infinitely more interest.

PERSONAL MENTION.
GUARD CALIFORNIA
WE have heretofore warned the Republican
party of this State that it is on guard, and the
result of . the election depends upon its vigi
lance. There is no wisdom in relying upon the im
passioned appeals to patriotism to arouse sentiment
which will make the people forget party misconduct.
The \vhole action of the party must be clean and an
appeal to the clean. When the decent people of the
party commune there is no use in passing them stale
swipes in a growler^ and asking them to believe that" it
is wine in a chalice.
Republican politics must come out from behind
a bar. The party in this city must not take its orders
from a saloon. The party must get off the free lunch
route and refuse absolutely the dictation of the bum
factories, which were the centers of influence in the
last State convention. There never was any reason
nor decency in saloon influence in any politics, and
least of all in Republican politics. Let there be an
end of it now.
The next State convention is in preparation. The
national ticket is in the field/ Everything has been
done decorously, decently and in order. Now let Re
publicanism in this city justify the expectations of its
friends, and 1 at the coming primaries make a sure
demonstration that it is. as of old, the party of law,
order and decency.
Let the primary election be a holiday for San Fran
cisco Republicans, and let them see to it that the dele
gates elected are truly representative of the party's de
sire to regain and retain its vestal reputation.
SEVERAL influential Filipinos, who represent
Aguinaldo, and were until recently a part of his
civil and military establishment, being yet in
sympathy with him, have proposed certain terms of
peace to which they engage to secure his assent. The
proposition is intrinsically interesting, because it di
vulges Aguinaldo's unbroken leadership of his people
and their unbroken sympathy with that for .which he
stands. Again, these men who are submitting terms
for pacification are not wild men suing for an end of
slaughter. They are mostly cultivated gentlemen with
educations acquired in European universities. They
have a clear knowledge of their own people and their
opinion of the conditions upon which peace may be i
had is entitled to the, greatest respect. The seven
propositions which they submit are mainly a modi
fication of the platform of the anti-Spanish revolu
tion of 1896, and are included in the treaty of
Biacbatano, by which that revolution was closed.
Spain immediately violated that treaty. Her perfidy
was foreseen by Aguinaldo, who deposited the pay
ment made by Spain for the benefit of his country, to
be used in defense of the principles of the revolution,
as it has been since against both Spain and the United
States. v
These seven propositions raise questions that are
not without difficulty in treatment. The slaughter and
destruction. we have wrought in .the islands have im
poverished the people, sapped their substance and left
them desperate and destitute.
The^piacid and peaceful conditions which Admiral
Dewey's officers found in Luzon as late as January,
1S99. are there no longer. Pa3'master Wilcox and
Cadet Sargent, especially commissioned to that duty
by Dewey, made a journey through the island in the
autumn of 1898 and their report was issued as an offi
cial document at Washington. They, found the peo
ple friendly, happy and prosperous; they were every
where well treated, and found the people very kind
and hospitable. They especially note the intelligence
of the natives. Arriving at' the town of Aparri, they
met there the report from Paris that the American
Commissioners favored the independence of the isl
ands, under an American protectorate. The military
commander of the province, Colonel Tivona. rega~ded
the news as so reliable that he concluded warfare was
at an end and surrendered his sword to a civil officer
who had been elected by the people. This civil of
ficer made a speech, thanking the soldiers and their
colonel for the services they had rendered liberty, and
assuring them that the principles of the war they had
begun would be perpetuated by the people of the
province, and that '"every man, woman and child
stood ready to take up arms to defend, their "newly
won liberty and to resist to the last drop of their
blood the attempt, of any nation whatever to bring
them back to their former state of dependence."
This report, considered of sufficient importance to
be published by our Government, is an index of thf.
feeling current at that time, not in Luzon alone, but in
Negros, Panay and throughout the islands.. The
seven conditions of peace now submitted need to be
judged by the causes of the revolution of 1896, and
the state of the people after the Spanish surrender, as
shown by this report of Dewey's officers and by other
testimony equally good.
One condition is a money payment to assist the
stricken people in the poverty and distress which have
taken 'the place of the joy and prosperity which
Dewey's officers foundihere less than two years ago-.
It is probable that no war has ever left as complete
ruin and sorrow in its train as this which we have
waged there in the last sixteen months. As we gave
money to repair the devastation wrought by Spain
in Cuba, we cannot remain indifferent to what we
have ourselves done.
Others of the conditions relate to the establishment
of civil government and the part to* be taken therein
by the natives, and the whole protocol leads up to
the last of the seven clauses, which is a demand for
expulsion of the Spanish friars. These friars seem to
represent oppression to the natives. There is no
need to go into the reason or lack of reason for this
feeling. Next to thei.r aspiration for independence it
is their most enduring sentiment. They demanded
expulsion of the friars in 1806, and Spain promised it
in the treaty of Biacbatano. These friars seem to be
chosen by the Archbishop of Manila as parish priests.
But the people want native priests, and complain of
the exactions of the friars, as well as of their conduct
in particulars that may not be discussed. More than
one member of the first Philippine Commission has
said that there can never be permanent peace under
any government that keeps the Spanish friars there.
This situation reveals a starting condition which
may well be considered by those who talk glibly
about our "Providential responsibilities." If the
treaty of Paris extended the whole body of the con
j stitution to the Philippines; we are not permitted to
fGrget that t the constitution is there for the friars as
well as for the Filipinos, and that under it we can ho
more expel them, or interfere with the Archbishop's
independence in appointing parish priests, than we
can in like manner interfere at home. This is likely
to be found the crux of the Philippine question, and
the country will await with interest the action of the
Taft Commission. This special subject will go for
digestion to Professor Moses,; to .whom all ecclesias
tical issues have been referred by the Commission
ers. As he is a Californian, his decision will be of
special interest on this coast.
(\ CONDITION OF PEACE.
OUST THE FAKERS.
7^HE Phelan fakers and their partner in doing
malicious injury to California, Dr. Kinyoun,
must, go. The far-reaching harm done by them
will be long felt by this State. As far as travel is con
cerned they have succeeded in sidetracking San Fran
cisco. The overland trains from the East bring" out
five and ten passengers instead of the full list that is
usual at this time of year. This city is on the grand
highway around the world, but travel is dodging
around it and seeking side lines, because the Mayor's
PÂ»oard of Health and Kinyoun and a monkey and a
guinea-pig have conspired to make all the world be
lieve that there is a plague epidemic here. An apology
is due the monkey and the guinea-pig. They have
wished us well by refusing to die when injected with
septic poison taken from dead Chinese. Their human
partners should be prosecuted by the Society for Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals. They have never seen
a living case of plague, here or elsewhere. If
they ever attended a medical school, or had any train
ing in their profession, they would remember that the
first warning they had in the dissecting room, from
the demonstrator of enatotny, was, not to cut them
selves while dissecting the dead. The chemical
changes that begin in the body immediately after
death make such a cut, or a mere scratch, dangerous.
As all men know who have worked in a dissecting
room, the blood-poisoning which results from such 3
wound causes enlargement of the glands, depravity of
the secretions, septic fever and death, unless the
speediest precautionary measures are taken. More
than one surgeon h^s lost his life in that way. To
take any part of a cadaver, either blood or tissue, and
h5 - podermicall3' inject it into a living animal, is to in
troduce this fatal sepsis more directly into the blood
than is possible in a superficial wound. It is poison,
no matter of what disease the subject may have died.
Even if death is caused by an accident, it is the same.
Yet this Phelan Board of Health has taken blood
and tissue- from dead Chinese, injected it into mon
keys, and when they turned sick asked the profession
and the public to take that as evidence of the plague!
Their conduct is the odium of the medical profession.
Dr. Kinyoun has aided and abetted this farce, and
with the members of the board should be disciplined
by' medical bodies. Any intelligent layman, would
know the folly of such a test. Yet upon such evi
dence an evil reputation has been created for this city
and State that will be bard to correct. On all grounds
the board and Kinyoun should step down and out.
Their retention in office gives color to their false re
ports of an epidemic, and if one should come in the
future no one would trust their judgment in dealing
with it.
Kinyoun has thoroughly discredited himself, and
the Federal Government should transfer him to some
place where he will have nothing more serious to deal
with than measles, whooping-cough and hives. Let
him have leisure to try these on his monkey colony,
and he will do but little^ harm. When he goes, as he
will, Phdan's Board of Health must go also. Its
misconduct has been vicious, a most exasperating
mixture of ignorance and malice. We appeal to the
medical profession to purge itself of any sympathy
with men who inject live monkeys with macerations
cf tissue from dead men and from the results diagnose
a plague epidemic. That is not medicine; it is a
monkey shine, in which the monkey is the more intel
ligent party. v
' We repeat that the only way to get rid of the harm
ful reputation which the city and State suffer is by
getting rid of the officials whose malice and ignorance
Lave caused it.

Mayor Phelan is about to attend the Democratic
National Convention. The delegation will take on a
lot of California wines and fruits. While the Mayor
is acting as bartender and caterer to the arid crowd,
what answer can he make when asked if it is true, as
reported by his Board of Health, that the plague is
epidemic in San Francisco?
bad. Or, if the board is convinced, after iavestigation,
that the whole system is bad, they should fearlessly
say so and ask the* Legislature to submit. an amend
ment to the constitution repealing that system. So far
as money goes, the State never made a worse invest
ment. The Legislature has appropriated for the ex
penses of the system $466,000 up to January 1, 1900:
the receipts from the sale of books have been
$1,043,128 83, making a total of $1,549,123 83. The ex
penditures have been $1,375,251 80. This leaves as
assets $173,872 03, "together with "a worn-out print
ing plant and a series of textbooks either obsolete or
needing revision." If the books had been furnished
free, this showing would have been poor enough, but
they have been sold to parents at prices little. if at all
lower than those for which better books could have
been purchased in the open market. The people
have thus paid for the books twice â once by taxation
and once by purchased ,

NATIONAL BANK STOCK MAY
BE TENTATIVELY ASSESSED
Judgfe Morrow Refuses to Restrain
the Assessor for Prudential
and Wise Reasons.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
handed down aa opinion yesterday refus
ing to issue a restraining order against
Assessor Dodge to prevent him from as
sessing the shares of the capital stock for
the fiscal year 1900-1901 of the First Na
tional Bank of San Francisco, the San
Francisco National Bank, the Crocker-
Woolworth National Bank and the Ne
vada National Bank.
Judge Morrow expressed the opinion
that the Assessor should be allowed to de
termine the elements of the assessment
and make an official record of the* amount
of the tax. and that the issues raised
should be fully determined while the As
sessor had the power to act, so that the
city and county might not suffer any loss
by reason of an Injunction. The temporary
restraining order heretofore made in the
case was dissolved, -with the proviso that
the complainants should have an opportu
nity of making further application to the
court before any attempt was made to en
force the collection of the taxes.
ST. MARY'S PARK FUND
STILL REMAINS INTACT
Judge Hebbard Hears Argument on
Brooks' Motion to Dissolve the
Temporary Injunction.
The legality of permitting the so-called
St. Mary's Park fund, which aggregates
$125,000, to be used for general purposes
was in issue before Judge Hebbard yester
day. The w'rit of injunction Issued against
Treasurer Brooks on the petition of
former Treasurer Christian Reis waa
called for argument on a motion to dis
solve. The facts of the case are the same
as those Involved In the Patek mandate
case, recently decided by Judge Seawell
against the park promoters.
Garber, Creswell & Garber, Garret Mc-
Enerney and George D. Shadburne ap
peared for the plaintiff, and William Rix
of Bishop & Wheeler appeared for Treas
urer Brooks. Mr. Shadburne asked for a
continuance, but as the court refused the
same a motion made by Mr. Rix to dis
solve the injunction was ordered argued.
After argument Judge Hebbard stated
that in his opinion the case belonged to
another department of the court, and, in
addition, should have been brought in
other form. The case was finally submit
ted, however, and an early decision Is ex
pected. ;
to reach and destroy Onondaga fort, nea:
Onelda Lake, In what is now the State of
New York. Instead of passing directly
up the St. Lawrence to Lake Ontario, the
allied Indian* preferred to ascend the Ot
tawa and Mattawa rivers to the vicinity
of Lake Nlpisslng. descend French River
to Georgian Bay and skirt the eastern
shore of the latter to the Huron settle
ment already referred to. This long Jour
ney was successfully accomplished by
Champlain, two French attendants ami
eight Indians. Â«^
Though this expedition was a failure as
a military Invasion, it led to some very
important results. It enabled Champlain
to form a clear conception of the geo
graphical relations between some points
already well known to him Individually.
It made him acquainted with the great
canoe route of the Upper Ottawa, which
was destined to be for many generations
the line of communication with the Hud
son Bay on the one hand and the head
of Lake Superior on the other, Mattawa
being the point of divergence. Lastly, it
brought down on the Huron settlement
a few years later a terrible revenge.
Twice it was assailed by the Iroquois. â¢
who reached it by the Trent River route
and scattered its members in different di
rections. Some of them were conducted
by way of Lake Nip!.Â«s=ing and the Ottawa
River to Quebec. Others fled toward Sault
Ste. Marie and passed thence southward
to the neighborhood of Detroit. With the
disappearance of this once powerful tribe
the French settlements fell for many
years an easy prey to the powerful and
revengeful Iroquois, until their own pow
er was broken by Governor Frontenac to
ward the close of the seventeenth cen
tury. 4
By a cruel irony of fate, Champlain.
whose life purpose was exploration, waa
debarred from ever again undertaking"
an exploratory expedition. The fur trade
monopoly, which was revived from timo
to time, hindered the development by re
stricting the commerce of the colony. To
the latter he felt constrained to devotÂ»
all .his time and labor, and even these did
not suffice to ward off misfortune. For
some years its very existence was serious
ly threatened by the Iroquois, who wera
encouraged and aided by the British colo
nists to the south. It became clear to
Champlain that the struggle for suprem
acy between the French and the British
had begun, and probably he felt Instinc
tively that it would have to be fought

through Intercourse between the fisher
men and the Indians, and when any at
tempt was made by the French King, In
accordance with the usual practice of
those times, to grant a monopoly of It,
the consequent restriction on their free
dom was bitterly resented by the hardy
adventurers who were the pioneers in a
traffic that Is still of considerable com
mercial importance. At the instance of
a personal friend, the Governor ot
Dieppe, Henry IV offered such a monop
oly to any one who would undertake to
settle a French colony in New France,
and the first attempt in that line was
made at the mouth of the Saguenay in
1600.* It was a failure, owing to the un
suitable character of the locality, though
Tadousac long continued to be a fur
trading post for the Indians who dwelt
Inland toward Hudson Bay.
A much more rational effort a.t colo
nization was made In 1003 b* a fellow
townsman of JacquÂ»s Cartier, a rich mer
chant of St. Malo, named Pontgra%'e, who
had with him as sailing master the cele
brated Samuel Champlain. The latter
was a native and resident of Brouage
on the Bay of Biscay. He had served
as a soldier during the civil wars, and
had visited the West Indies In a Spanish
ship. He was doubtless acquainted with
what had already been accomplished In
the way of discovery and exploration, and
he was fortunately able not merely to
record his observations with fair literary
skill but to Illustrate his descriptive nar
rative with drawings and maps,
When Champlain ascended the St. Law
rence on his first voyage he found that the
Hurons of Stadlcona and Hochelaga had
disappeared. They had been driven oui
by their relentless kinsmen, the Iroquois,
and had taken refuge far away in the
depths of the wilderness lying between
Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay.
Champlain found at Hochelaga a few Al
gonquin Indians of nomadic habits. They
told him in a vague way of rivers and
lakes beyond the Lachine rapids, but find
ing these impassable he spent some time
in exploring the Saguenay and then re
turned to France.
In 1604 Champlain made his second voy
age to America, this time in company
with De Monts, a French nobleman, who
had secured a monopoly of the fur trade
and whose aim was to establish a colony.
By a strange fatuity the beautiful An
napolis Valley, which had been first vis
ited, was neglected, and the place selected
for winter quarters was an unsuitable isl
and In the mouth of the St. Crolx River.
The experience of one inclement season
was fatal to the success of the enterprise.
Meanwhile Champlain, whose restless
energy had prompted him to explore the
New England coast, in the summer of 1606,
was again chosen by De Monts to conduct
a colonizing expedition, this time to the
St. Lawrence. The spot selected waa the
abandoned site of the Huron village. Stad
icona, and there in 1608 Champlain laid the
foundation of the present city of Quebec,
which has had a continuous history till
the present time. The first winter was one
of extreme severity and anxiety. Cham
plain had to contend with disaffection
amounting to conspiracy, and the latter
was finally suppressed only after the ring
leader waa convicted and executed. The
ravages of scurvy made serious inroads
on the little settlement, but the courage,
resource, energy and persistence of Cham
plain overcame all obstacles, and the sum
mer of 1609 saw him again busily occupied
in his favorite work of exploration.
The founder ofÂ« Quebec has not put on
record the motive which prompted him In
that year to enter into an alliance with
the Huron and Algonquin Indians against
the Iroquois. but he was probably mis
taken as to the strength of the latter, and
It was certainly to his interest to cultivate
the friendship of the Algonqulns, who con
trolled the region of the upper Ottawa, his
best waterway Into the interior of the con
tinent. Whatever his object was. the im
mediate result "was a victory for the Al
gonquin-Huron alliance, won by the aid of
French firearms. Later on. and for more
than a century, the . Iroquois amply
avenged themselves for this Intervention
by Champlain, as they were easily able
to do when they became possessed of fire
arms and ammunition by trading with the
British to the south. From a geographer's
viewpoint the incident waa equally im
portant, as It made the French acquainted
with the lake which still bears Cham
plain's Â¦ name, with the Richelieu River,
which Is its outlet to the St. Lawrence,
and with the portage which affords ac
cess from Lake George to the upper
waters of the Hudson River. This great
thoroughfare from New York to Montreal
has figured prominently In every great
â¢war on this continent. ' Along it pa?se:i and
repassed many a British and French hos
tile expedition prior to 17j9. It was used
for the same purpose in the revolutionary
war, which began in 1773, and it was de
voted to a like use for the last time during
the war of 1512-11
Passing over the struggles of the little
French settlement during the next few
years and the heroic efforts and un
wearied energy of Its founder and ruler,
who made several voyages to France in
Its interest, we come to his next Import
ant attempt at exploration. While in Paris
in 1612 he saw a map which purported to

II. *
For a quarter of a century after the
death of Jacques Cartier comparatively
little was added to the Information al
ready acquired respecting the- river St.
Lawrence and the gulf of the same name.
Fishermen from France ,and also from
other European countries resorted to the
Newfoundland "banks" in rapidly in
creasing numbers, but as they seldom
sought land except for shelter or sup
plies they did little either to supplement
what Â¦was already known about the coast
line or correct the prevalent misconcep
tions of geographers as to topographical
details. |s France was during tho latter
half of "the sixteenth century In posses
sion of the whole of Acadla and Canada
as tho result of Cartler's expeditions, but,
on account of religious dissensions, po
litical strife and actual civil war in that
unhappy country, nothing was officially
done either to extend her American pos
sessions or make use of those already
partially explored.
A more fortunate era came In with the
advent of Henry IV to the throne. The
publication of the edict of Nantes, by
proclalmlng religious toleration, removed
the chief cause of paralyzing' civtl war,
and national activity was soon redirected
toward the new world. Its fur trade had I
gradually, been .coming into prominence I
two years before by Henry Hudson, and
still named after himâ Hudson Bay. About
the same time thero arrived from Canada
a young Frenchman named Vignau. who
informed Champlain that during the pre
ceding winter he had gone northward Â¦with
a party of Algonquin Indians and hail
while v/ith them visited a salt-water sra.
en the shore of which they hail found the
remains of an Enplinh ship. The circum
stantiality of the story seems to have out
weighed its improbability with Champ
lain, and ho resolved on his return to
Canada to ascertain for himself the. na
ture of the Ottawa Valley. Taking with,
him Vignau And four other Frenchmen,
with an Indian guide, he voyaged by
canoe up the Ottawa, passed the Rldeau
and the Chadulere falls, near the sita of
the present capital of the Dominion of
Canada, and finally arrived at Allumette
Lake, an expansion of the Ottawa River.
From the Alsronqulns of this locality he
learned that Vignau'a story was a concoc
tion of falsehoods, Â¦which the lying rascal
admitted to be the case. Champlain. how
ever turned the Incident to good account,
for he acquired much geographical infor
mation that was afterward useful to him.
and he further, strengthened his hold on
the esteem and confidence of the Indian*.
Two years passed before Champlain
again attempted the ascent of the Ottawa
River, but in 1613. In fulfillment of a prom
ise to' aid the allied Hurons and Algon
qulns against the Iroquois. he made an
extensive roundabout Journey of which
the passage up the Ottawa, formed but a
part. The purpose of the expedition was

Acting Mayor During
Phelan's Absence.
Supervisors Enjoined Prom
Awarding City Printing
Contracts.
The Mayor was granted a leave of ab
sence for sixty days from June 23, to at
tend the Democratic National Convention
at Kansas City, the resolution being in
troduced by Supervisor Curtis. The char
ter does not provide that the Mayor shall
be granted permission to leave the State,
but the bill was adopted as a measure of
safety. Supervisor .Tobin was unani
mously chosen as acting Mayor during his
Honor's absence. Curtis explained that
It was customary for the chairman of the
Finance Committee to be so honored, but
Supervisor Jennings had pleaded that his
private business would not allow him to
act.
"Wo ought to take some measures in
order that the building may be accepted
immediately," said Comte, vehemently.
"It seems to me that an end should be.
put to the vexatious delays which have
characterized the slow progress in Its con
struction. It seems to me that the city
should be put in possession of the struc
ture and that the claims should be adjuui
cated later."
The resolution was unanimously adopt
ed.
The Printing Committee presented a res
olution requesting the approval of its ac
tion in awarding contracts for printing
to those firms only that were entitled to
use the label of the Allied Printing
Trades. Consideration was postponed un
til next meeting on account of the in
junction served on the board.
Attorney Ruef Addressed the board on
the subject of erasures in bids and held
that the charter specifically provided that
bids 5o altered must be rejected even If
there was but a single erasure. The
whole question was finally -referred to
the Judiciary Committee.
A number of resolutions were then
adopted providing for awarding contracts
for supplying city stationery and books.
The City Attorney was requested to
appear for the city in the injunction pro
ceedings.
A resolution was introduced by Comte.
asking the City Attorney for an opinion
as to whether the city might proceed to
accept and occupy the Hall of Justice
and Morgue building before the claims uX
the creditors were adjusted.
The Stanley-Taylor Company, at whose
instance the injunction was served, filed
a communication demanding that it be
awarded the contract for doing certain
printing. The demand is made upon the
ground that the firm had complied with
all the conditions upon which the pro
posals were called for and was the lowest
bidder for the contract of furnishing
printed forms and blanks.
Phillips & Smyth protested against the
award of the contract for printing to J.
H. Barry of the Star and the Commercial
Publishing Company. George Spauld
ing also demanded that he be awarded fne
contract for printing, claiming to be the
lowest bidder. The three communications
were referred to the Printing Committee,
as the awards had not been made when
they were read.
Booth explained that tho Injunction
which had been served on the board af
fected the printing only and no interfer
ence had been attempted on books and
stationery. The bids of George Spauld
lng and the Stanley-Taylor Company had
been rejected because the bidders did not
have the right to use the label of the
Allied Printing Trades Union. The pro
test of Phillips & Smyth against Barry
and the Commercial Publishing Company
Is based on the fact that certain items had
been erased in their bids and the claim is
made that such procedure invalidates the
whole bid.
That there is trouble ahead for the
Board of Supervisors In awarding the
contracts for municipal printing was
manifested yesterday by it being served
with a restraining order against accept
ing tho bids of certain firms on .seventy
live items and by the filing of several
protests against any action being taken

in stringing power wires for operating street
cars on Bush street, between Sansome and
Kearny.
In the communication, signed by Su
perintendent of Construction H. II. Lynch
of the Market-street Company, it Is ac
knowledged that the corporation never
had the right to operate electric cars on
the two blocks mentioned. He says: .
The two blocks referred to form a necessary :
connectlne link between the electric lines on
Sansome and Kearny streets, and it waa gen
erally understood that the Bush-street Una
would be used as such connecting link, . alÂ» v

fully granted, and the wires have. In accord
ance with such permission, been so attached.
They are doubly Insulated and securely an
chored, bo that no danger to the buildings, can
result therefrom.
The communication was referred to the
Street Committee. While the property
owners may have given permission to at
tach the wires to their buildings, it is
certain that the company has never re-*
ceived the privilege to use the two blocks

Tobln expressed himself in favor of re
stricting fences to ten feet, but said that
the arguments of the Â£ill posters had
convinced him that they were entitled to
some consideration.
D'Ancona's amendment that the ordlÂ»
nance go Into immediate effect was lost,
only the mover and Booth voting in favor
of it. The ordinance was then finally
passed to go into eifect on July 1, 1901,
Booth alone voting no.
Brandonsteins ordinance limiting the
height and construction of fences used
for advertising or other purposes to twen
ty feet was taken from the street com
mittee and was referred to the Judiciary
committee for consideration. BranUen
stcin explained that his ordinance was de
signed to abolish fences especially con
structed for "spite" purposes and to reg
ulate the maintenance of fences except
those used for windbreaks during the in
terim when the ten-foot ordinance was in
operative.
The ordinance providing revenue for the
Expenses of the municipal government
during the next fiscal year and fixing the
tax levy at $1,127 on every $100 of an
assessed valuation of $375,000,000 was final
ly passed. The ordinance was then signed
by the Mayor and became a law imme
diately.
The bids for hay for the Almshouse
and Emergency Hospital submitted by-
Scott & Magner were rejected, the fig
ure of $13 70 per ton being considered too
high by the board. The invitation for
proposals was ordered readvertised.
Reed's motion that a committee of three
be appointed to ascertain the amount of
hay. grain and feed necessary for thÂ©
cltv's use and whether the contract there
for could be let as a whole was carried
â¢and the Mayor appointed the judiciary
committee to investigate the matter.
Ordinances were adopted In accordance
with the following recommendation of the
Mayor:
Brandensteln said that Booth's amend
ment would involve the investigation of
the books of the bill postlns monopoly,
which would not be feasible. D'AJicona
submitted that the ordinance could be
passed to take effect immediately, and
that special permits might then be issued
in cases where the contracts are already
in existence.
The ordinance limiting the height of
fences used for advertising purposes to
go into effect July 1. 1001. was finally
passed at yesterday's meeting of the
Board of Supervisors. BootK Insisted In
his former -amendment that the ordinance
go Into effect immediately and that only
existing contracts now held by the bill
posters be exempted from Its operation.
"To have the ordinance go into effect

Property-Owners in Vicinity Or
ganize Improvement Club to
Collect Subscriptions. Â¦
A' number of property owners in the
vicinity of the Hospital lot bounded by
Steiner, Scott. Ridley and Waller streets,
which was recently dedicated to park
purposes by the Supervisors, organized
a club last week to be known as the New
Park Improvement Club. The officers
are: President, E. C. Prlber; vice presi
dent, Major Charles Boxton; secretary,
C. B. Jr*erklns; treasurer, C. B. .Keenan;
iinance committeeâ T. E. Treacy, C. H.
Olinger, E. \V. Hinkle, ti. Steliing, J. W,
Stetson. Major Boxton and I. Anderson.
An improvement fund" is in course of
collection, a proviso of the dedication be
ing that the property owners pledga
themselves to defray the expenses of im
proving the lot. At the last meeting the
following named signed the subscription
list, in addition to the officers named:
Captain John. Seymour, Captain C. C.
Morse. E. Walters, W. J. H. White, E. G.
White, H. G. Moore, M. Hart, M. Harder,
A. Ruef. A. W. Furst, J. J. .Flinn and
T. P. Robinson.
A circular just Issued by the club an
nounces that the members are meeting
with success in their efforts to secure
the new park in the vicinity of their
homes. Many have already paid their
subscriptions, but not nearly enough has
been received to justify the Park Com

ommend that the position of mortgage clerk
in the Recorder's office be discontinued until
there will be again a necessity for it two
months prior to the first Monday in March

Gas and Electric Company was directeu
to light the streets as it now lights them
on the 12 o'clock schedule until the board
determined on Monday what course it
shall pursue. Bids will bo opened on thai
day for public lighting and it is expected
that competition will insure lower rates.
City Attorney Lane objected to being
summoned by committees that desired his
opinion. In a communication Lane stated
that "the law governing- the office of City
Attorney provides that al> requests for
the opinion of the City Attorney shall be
in writing and his answer shalLbe in the

The application of Joseph Kanal that
ho be released from his contract to fur
nish milk to the City and County Hospital
at 11 1-3 cents a gallon was denied. Kanal
claimed that he was unable to furnish the
milk aa he could not provide a sufficient
number of milch cows though he ad
mitted that he owned 150 cows, which
yielded 130 cans a day and that the in
stitution only required thirty-five cans a
day. Boxton explained that Kanal had

Ncti' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, June 25.â There was consider
able speculative activity in the stock market
to-day and the fluctuations in prices were
<;uite wide and frequent. The net changes
â¢were mostly "Email, bo that the result of the
day's trading Is not conclusive as to the turn
In prices. The market was exceedingly irregu
lar a.11 day and at times much confused. The
cj>ening depression. In eympathy with London,
where the Chine-fee outbreak had an unfavor
able effect, was generally overcome. Prices
then broke with ecme violence, the bear attack
lK-ine dirr-cted especially against Baltimore and
Ohio. Continued pressure wae In evidence also
ngainrt Brooklyn Transit. Boston and Ohio
MtSercd to the extent of four points at the
[mint level and Brooklyn Transit rold to 4Â».
vhich -was 2*k below Saturday's level. In
sympathy with this acute weakness the whole
market s=<;ld off end apparently the liquidation
of last week was renewed in force. But the
msrket gave evidence later of being oversold
end the ;Â¦Â¦â¢.!.-= beean to absorb stocks to cover
their short contracts. The result was a gen
eral recovery of the earlier Jesse*. But ther*
was nothing like demoralization among bears,
the covering rr.&vement being conducted in a
weil-oro>red manner. The bulls attempted to
more than a fraction above Saturday's level,
eacept in Brooklyn Transit, when the demand
Ircm shorts dlTr.inlshed to almost nothing. The
<Jribb!e of liquidation was sufficient to turn
prices downward again and they were only
partly erroste-i at about Saturday night's level,
where the movement became very irregular at
the closing. The stock market was apparently
as jnueh ovcrzoli as the wheat market was
overbought Aid jjroieEFlenal realizing caused

CHICAGO. June 25.â It was a wild day In
wheat, a battle between bulls and bears In
which the latter, for the first time in weeks,
scored a victory. July opened at . 87%@86%c,
sold between 88% and 83%c, closing 2c under
Saturday at SCc. There was some dispute as
to what really were the opening figures-, so
many trades took place at the sound of the
gong. Some made the initial range from 8S@
fct>%c. Certain it is that all sorts of prices were
paid in a Jumble and that two minutes after
the opening July changed hands at 88%c. In
the field of news the bulls retained their old
friend, the Northwest crop wreck. Manitoba
had rain, but Minnesota and the Dakotas re
ported dry scorching weather â the kind that
burns up vegetation in short order. One Da
kota reporter had the temerity to mention the
appearance of fly. What harm fly wtiuld find
lett to do was not mentioned. On the bear side
of the bulletin board was the Liverpool weak
ness In the face of the 4%c advance Saturday,
the excellent conditions prevailing In the
Southwest and the heavy world's shipments
which Included 2,000,ouO bushels from Russia.-
The visible was also on the bear side of the
fence, showing an Increase of 1.348,000 bushels.
The Southwest said "look out for a big move
ment," and declared that harvesting was pro
gressing in many sections under the most fa
vorable circumstances with promises of wheat
enough to go a long ways toward making up
the shortage caused by the Northwest failure.
The Hems given undoubtedly had some Influ
ence in selling. Longs were profit-takers Sat
urday and ready fcr more. The news had the
effect of prodding them along, and to a de
gree of lessening the demand from certain sec
tions, although the Northwest was still cred
ited wlh paying good prices to make up the
home shortage. For a time following the
opening the market held steadily over 87c. The
hammering by holders . shortly before noon,
however, began to tell. July sagged to 85c and
then, all In a few minutes broke down u
639ic. At 83c stop-loss orders in large numbers
were reached for the first time nince the re
cent advance began and there was such a rush
to sell that between 85c and the bottom there
was scarcely a check to the decline. Support,
credited by many to Wall street Interest,
caught the breaking cereal at 83Tic and hauled
It back to 86c, at which the market closed.
Corn was active and suffered with wheat
and was at one time 2%c lower than It closed
Saturday. It recovered l%c of this loss and
closed l@HÂ»c lower at 4%c. Throughout wheat
furnished the motive.
Oats alone of the markets on the board held
against the downward pressure. With the
break In wheat, oats dropped off but recovered
In 'good shape. The support came from the
Northwest in the shape of damage claims, ac
companied by buying orders. July closed %c
over Saturday. .
Provisions were weak under heavy hog re
ceipts and the wheat decline. There waÂ« a
fair outside demand which became effective
at the bottom and caused some recovery. The
close, however, was rather weak at that. July
pork closed at 32%c under Saturday, lard 20c
lower and ribs 17%!?}-20c down.

Chicago was lower, . declining from SSc- to

caused by heavy realizing by Chicago opera

There were more buyers than sellers on the

course of Liverpool, which weakened under
large Russian shipments. There was nothing
in Northwestern conditions to cause a break,

were light showers In Manitoba, but elsewhere

here. In the South and abroad have been so
effectually rounded up, but inasmuch as the
primary cause for the covering was bonande
influences and not manipulation the uplift was
scored with comparative ease. For several
weeks bad crop reports have been pouring in
from, nearly all' parts of Â¦ the belt and the
European bear factions have been restless.
The public manifested an inclination to buy
and leading operators here finally made a bold
stand on the bull side. -Day after day prices
climbed with a dizzy rush. This morning ex
ceptionally strong financial cables and par
ticularly bad reports sent prices on first sales
20 to 25 points upward and forced the few re
maining bear* to seek safer grounds. The
rise proved too fast for One house, Dennis,
Perkins & Co., and at midday its suspension
was reported from the roetrura. The announce
ment created distrust in the bull ranks. It
being feared other concerns might be Involved
and In a frantic effort to unload prices were
pounded down 8 points before the final gong
Bounded. Wherea* the West, the South, Wall
street and Europe had bought on the opening
rise representatives of all these interests were
heavy sellers on the break. Once more jubilant
boars hammered the entire list and called at
tention to better weather prospects and good
crop reports from Texas.' A tumble of 4c in
wheat also operated as a stimulant on Â¦ the
selling: movement. Conservative estimates of
the day's transactions placed the amount at
considerably over 1,000.000 bales, the trades
made In many instances reaching many thou
sands of bales in a single operation.' The
feeling after the close of the Exchange was
weak,*the crowds anticipating a bull panic In
Liverpool to-morrow and a less bullish weekly
Government report at noon Tuesday than here
tofore anticipated.

ANGEL-S CAMP, June 23.â An attempt
was made to fire the town of Mokelumne
Hill last Thursday night, but the vigil
ance of John Albright, -who was sitting
up with a sick friend, frustrated the
scheme before the fire was well started.
He had returned to his room to get an
overcoat when a bright light attracted his
attention. On investigation he found a
candle propped up against a pitchplne
board and the whole contrivance covered
with lard. The l>oard had already caught
and in a few minutes the whole neighbor

LINCOLN*, Nebr., June 25.â W. J. Bryan
returned at noon to-day from his Wis
consin fishing trip and his later visit to
Chicago. He will remain in Lincoln until
after the Democratic National Conven
tion. He said he had been, placed in a
wrong position by some one who had pre
sumed to outline his plan of campaign
and dictated, the following;
"Any statements made by anybody in,
regaro. to my campaign plans are with
out foundation or authority. No plans
have been made by me or any ono for me,
and no plans will bo made until after the
convention nas been held." Â¦ -*-x
Mr. Bryan was asked whether he could
say anything: in regard to the platform
to be adopted at Kansas City. He re
plied:
"No one, of course, can say what lan
guage will be used in Betting forth the
party principles. But some idea can be
obtained as to the general tenor of the*
platform from the platform adopted in
the State conventions. As a large ma
jority of the delegates have been elected
by conventions wnich reaffirmed the Chi
cago platform, it is safe to assume that
the Ivansas City platform will reafllnn
the Chicago platform and will contain
nothing which can be construed as a sur
render or modification of that platform
on the old issues.
"It is equally certain that there will
be a strong and deiinite plank against
the trusts. There is also no doubt that
the plank against imperialism will be
clear and explicit. Militarism will be de
nounced and sympathy expressed for tho
Boers. This much is evident from what
has already taken place."
"You have refused to discuss the Vice
Presidency heretofore, Mr. Bryan. Is
there any truth in the rumors that a Vice
President will be chosen whose views on
the money question will be attractive to
those who opposed the ticket in 1S96?"*'
"It is true that I have refused to dis
cuss the Vice Presidency," replied Mr.
Bryan, "and I don't care to do so now,
further than to say that I assume that
the candidate nominated for Vice Presi
dent will be in harmony with the plat
form. The Vice President not only pre
sides over the Senate while the President
is alive, but assumes the office of Pres
ident in case of the President's death,
and It Is hardly probable that the dele
gates to a nutlonal convention would
Â¦write a platform and then select for eith
er place on a ticket a man who would
repudiate the platform. *
"No man worthy to be considered for
such an office would accept a nomination
upon a platform repugnant to his views
on anv important issue. In every cam
paign men support a ticket without ap
proving all of the platform, but none can
defend a platform unless he believes in it.
Many tariff reform gold Democrats sup
ported the Republican ticket four years
ago, although they dissented from the
protection plank. â¢ But the Republican
convention would not have nominated a
tariff reformer upon a protection plat
form. There Is sometimes a Joint debate
between candidates on opposing tickets,
but* not between candidates on tho same
ticket." :. -.-

lotti In the Superior Court this morning
gave a decision in the mandate proceed
ing brought by Charles E. Ames against
the Town Trustees of Sausallto to com
pel them to issue him a pool selling li
cense. In his. decision Judge Angellotti
held that pool selling was against public
morals, and that those who wished to
engage In the so-called business could ex
pect no aid from the law. In his decision
he cited many cases where the courts
had held betting and pool selling to bÂ»
contrary to public morals. The decision
was given on the broader ground. The
court seemed to doubt that the Sausalito
ordinance was valid, but said that the
question could not be considered in tho
present case.
The demurrer of the Town Trustees was
sustained and Ames* application for a
writ of mandate was denied.
Henry C. McPike, attorney for Ames,
seemed pleased with the decision, al
though against him, and said: "Mr
Ames will probably start his poolrooms
In Sausalito. If a fight Is made against
him by the other pool sellers, they will
simply be closing their own doors."
. It is unlikely that Ames will ask for
the consent of the Trustees, but will trust
to his ability to prove the ordinance un
constitutional. If the pool sellers fight
Sausalito may lose the business.
JudgÂ« Gaddis Hands Down a Lengthy
Decision in Which He Says the
Signature Is Genuine,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, June 25.â Judge Gaddis
to-day rendered a lengthy decision in the
Johns estate case, sustaining the validity
of the $10,000 note, which, for nearly three
weeks, has been the source of. sensational
litigation.
G. XV. Johns died on the 26th of Novem
ber, 1898. He left a larg-e and valuable es
tate, most of which is in Colusa County.
By the terms of the will Elizabeth J.
Gregory and Polly Ann Friel, his two
daughters, and the Allen brothers, sons
of a deceased daughter, were the heirs.
Elizabeth J. Gregory and her eon,
George W. Gregory, were named as exec
utors without bonds.
Several months after the death of Johns
George W. Gregory presented a note for
JlO.OOu, purported to have been executed
by Johns in favor of George W. Gregory
and his sister, Mary Gregory. The other
executor allowed the claim and the court
approved.
Mrs. Frlel and Tandy Allen filed a peti
tion for the suspension of the powers of
the executors, alleging that the note was
a forgery.
When this petition was heard a great
mass of testimony was heard. Experts
Kytka and Eisenschimel testified that
the signature was a clumsy forgery. Ex
pert Ames testified that it was genuine.
Both sides were reinforced by the expert
testimony of lesser lights.
Messrs. Deligne. Ball and Hiram John
son appeared for contestants. Messrs.
Grant, Hawkins and Grove L. Johnson
represented the executors. The case was
contested with great stubbornness.
In concluding his lengthy decision Judge
Gaddis says:
I have given the case mature and careful
consideration, and particularly on account of
the large sum of money involved, as well as
the charg-e of forgery which has been made.
After a deliberation which fully satisfies me of
the correctness of this decision, I must say
that I have not the slightest doubt that the
Â¦signature to the note Is In the handwriting of
O. W. Johns.
There is no doubt that the case will be
appealed.

][ and an elephant behind them on the
California Navigation and Improve
ment Company's steamer J. D. Peters last
night. In consequence the stevedores
worked as they never did in their lives be
fore, and the ship got away sharp on time.
Two cannons, relics of the Sapnish war,
found a resting place on the port bow of
the steamer, while Cannon, the fat man,
was located In the forward stateroom on
the starboard bide. This kind of evened
up things, and when the elephant came
along there was little or no trouble.
The elephant is known as the "Prin
cess." and two attempts have been made to
send her to Stockton. Princess has a mind
of her own, and on neither the Dauntless
nor Captain Weber would she set a foot.
The people on the Weber and Dauntless

all bound to the Stockton street fair, and
it was touch and go with them yesterday.
The elephant just squeezed under the
archway of the lower deck in the Peters,
Cannon just squeezed into the largest
doorway on the steamer, while the other
cannons managed to keep the steamer on
an even keel.
Had it not been for Sergeant Tom Ma

that debonnair Charley Clark, the popular

Be that as it may. Princess either would
not or could not board the Dauntless or
Weber, but yesterday she walked down
the gangplank of the J. D. Peters as
though it was an everyday occurrence.
Princess has been one of the attractions

men. Tweli-e fonued a quorum, and we
never did bustntsj'. of course, with less. We
were made acquaint*:} with the duties of
the Assessor unitr the law. We learned
that It was your duty to collect all taxes
on personal property which was n<n secured
by real estate. anJ the law provldf-d a way
for you to collect them, and when you
qualified as Assessor you took an oath tÂ»
comply with the law. We learned that the
law held you and your bondsmen responsible
lor ell you iailed to collect. We learned
that the law requires you to turn over to
the clerk of the Board of Supervisors on
the lr.th day of July the complete personal
property "afsewiinent roll." The law does
not contemplate that you shall eliminate
from that "asfrfESmect roll" before turning
it over all of the delinquent portion, which
eum total you and your bondsmen would
owe the county. Iicn't you understand that
by emitting from this roll, and destroying
the delinquent list, you can't tell how much
you and your bondsmen want to pay the
county, and it m'-trht cause you lots of worry
for fear you might overpay cr not pay
enough?
Vour paper, the Enquirer, last Thursday
evening states that you did not admit de
ttrcying anything.
Now, Mr. l>altÂ»n. I challenge you to po
before ar.y person In the city of Oakland
who Is legally qualified to administer an
oath and subscribe to an cath that you did
not aiimit the destruction of all the ""Held
memorandum books" as well as the "iffice
book" into which was transcribed the con
tents of all at the field books, which was
the only complete pertcnal property assesg
mÂ«H liet fhowlag paid and unpaid taxes.
I am revealing no secret of the Grand Jury
room when I challenge you to po before such
lfgally qualified ;Â«r?an and make oath that
you did not a_m:t that you destroyed cer
tain data or memorandum in order to pro
tect vour bondsmen. I am revealing no
secret cf the Grand Jury when I c halifnge
you to m_ke an <iath that you did net admit
that you knew you were not complying with
The law. I challenge yea to make oath that
you did not admit that you fallal to en
force the law in order to protect your bonds
rr.f n. I challenge you further to make cath
th_t the office book whirh the Grand Jury
ch/Â»rgÂ«l you with <1>-Â«!tro>-in(r did not contain
m^nnorarda of delinquent assessment*, for
*"fc:ch amount y^u p.ni_rour_b^nj^m'ji would
have had to pay if the law were enforced.
And I finally challenge y.ou to make oath
that you. Henry P. Dalton. Assessor' of
Alameda Ccuctv. n<-ver receipted a tar bill
when no payment was? ever made. Now. sir,
if you have the courage to s-'Ubscrlhe your
oath to the above a* sujreestt-d I will pay
the necessary expense f<->r the same, and
your friends and the public generally may
believe you are an honest county official
who ha* been outraged by an Al&meda.
County Grand Jury for "political purposes
oclj - ."
This Is distasteful to me. but I think that
the Grand Jury has heen abused enough by
you without being allowed to make public
the evidence obtained. I do not believe a
member cf that Grand Jury had any confi
dence in that Indictment. I believe that
you. yourself, could have drawn up the in
dlctraest eo It would not cave convicted you.
Did Judse Hall rule that the complete
_cw?ssnit roll contained in the office book
Â¦which was destroyed would not have con
stituted an official recrird. lnFtead of the of
?.ce book which was turned over to the
Beard of Supervisor* containing only a par
tial lirt cf persona! property assessment*?

. John Howison . and John McConnell,
father of Frank McConnell, the pugilist,
had a "mix-up" at a meeting of the Ship
wrights' Association Friday night. Mc-
Connell Is president of the association, and
during a discussion on a resolution inter
rupted Howison, saying he was out of
order. Howison persisted in speaking and
McConnell left the chair to argue the
point.
Howison became excited and shouted
that McConnell was trying to make him
out a liar. McConnell retorted that he
could take It that way if he felt Inclined.
Howison rushed at him and struck him
on the face. They were separated by the
other members.' â¢
McConnell had Howison arrested on a
charge of battery and the case came up
before Judge Fritz yesterday morning.
After hearing the evidence the court con
victed Howison, and at his request sen

MOTHER scandal has arisen out of
/L\ lhe traffic In Chinese ss it has been
jl i\ made at this port. The Call has
already <>rpos<*i the operations of
the ring which has during the administra
tion of Colonel John P. Jackson handled
the caees of many thousands of coolies
landed at this port. It is now the turn
of James It. Dunn, inspector in charge of
the Chinese Bureau, to boar the brunt of
eerious allegations. He has been accused
of willfully neglecting his duty as in
rpector In charge of the Chinese Bureau.
Jle will be called upon to-day to answer
before his superior the charge of willful
and deliberate disobedience of the written
order of his superior.
He will be asked to prove that .he has
not willfully and deliberately deprived a
Chinese of his right to appeal from the
dociFlon of the Collector of the Port to
the Secretary of the Treasury by sending
the appealing Chinese out of the country.
Further than this the chief of the Chi
nese Bureau is formally accused of ex
ercising partiality in the administration
of his office and of general incompeteney.
The charges will create a sensation in
Federal circles, where the Chinese traffic
has been a matter of constant scandal and
where Dunn since his appearance on the
coast has escaped the shadow of suspicion
or reproach. The accuser, Lyman T.
Mowry. demands an immediate Investiga
tion of the charges which will be placed
in the hands of Collector of the Port John
P. Jackson this morning. â¢Â¦ .
The charges are in full as follows:

May 20, 1900, holding steamship
ticket No. 63, to depart for China per
steamship China on Friday, June 22
1900.
I therefore charge said James R.
Dunn as follows:
Firstâ I charge said James R.

as inspector in charge of the Chinese
Bureau. - ."
Second â I charge said James R.

Fourth â I charge 6aid James R.

' A bold and brutal hold-up occurred In
Chinatown shoitly after. 1 o'clock yester
day morning. Ah Sing, a pretty Chinese
wornfin, residing at 8 Ross alley, was held
up on Jackson fetreet, near her home, by
two of her countrymen, severely beaten
and robbed of jewelry valued at over $100.
Special Officer James Downey and. Of
ficers Amend and Barry were near, the
scene when the thing happened and gave
chase to the robbers, but were unable to
capture them. A report of the affair was
made Immediately to the California-street
police station, and several otticers were
detailed on the case.
According to Ah Sing's story she was
returning irom a banquet when the hold
up occurred. She was attired in much
iinery, Including earrings, necklaces and
rings. She passed up Jackson street, and
as she approached the alley In which her
home is located she was seized by two
Chinese and the work of robbing her com
menced. The thugs used brutal means,
first beating the woman and then. tearing
the earrings out of the flesh of her ears.
In taking the rings off the hands they also
severely lacerated the flesh on those mem-
It was. some moments before the unfor
tunate woman could recover herself suf
ficiently to call for help. At her first
scream the special officer and the patrol
men responded, in time, to see the high
waymen as they, disappeared around "a
corner. Ah Sing gave the police a de
scription- of. her assailants, but as yet
their identity has not been established.

SCANDAL IN THE
CHINESE BUREAU
AL.L. eyes, theatrical and of the thea
atergolng, are turned to th'e big
benefit to be given for the family of
the brave fireman. John Edward
Sweeney, next Friday afternoon. The
programme was prepared yesterday at a
meeting of the theater managers. The
box-office at the Grand Opera-house will
be open this morning, and the crowds will
be on hand when the doors are opened for
the big show Friday.
The programme Is so far one of events
only. There is but a semblance of oiÂ«^r
to it at present, for the managers say
that with more attractions In sight they
cannot decide. a definite arrangement un
til to-day or to-morrow. It will not be a
programme full of advertising matter and
reeking with the pictorial display "ad."
Instead It will be a neat, plain sheet, with
the names of the players, their contribu
tions to the amusement and the order of
the performance. They will be good sou
venirs of the occasion, and it is worth
keeping a souvenir of such a benefit for
such a cause.
The programme will be divided Into two
parts. The first part will partake of the
nature of a minstrel entertainment, minus
the black face, with all the matinee he
roes and the well-known funmakers and
favorites sitting round the stage in the
good old style of twenty years ago. Ed
win Stevens will be Interlocutor and Fer
ris Hartraan of the Tivoll, Gilbert and
Goldle of the Orpheurn. and Harry Cash
man of the Tivoli will be the end men.
The programme of the first part will be
opened by the Tlvoil quartet. This will
bo followed by a comic song by Harry
Cashman; a tenor solo by Tom Green of
the Tivoll; specialties by Gilbert and Gol
dle- a barytone solo by Sidney Dean of the
Orpheum; a comic song by Ferris Hart
man- some ballads by Arthur Boyce of
the Tivoll; and a grand finale in which the
entire company, including the chorus of
the Tivoll and the chorus of the Milk
White Flag Company, will wind up the
first half of the programme.
There will be no intermissionâ there is
too much on the programme to allow of
one, and so the second part will-com
mence as soon as the tlrst Is finished. In
the second part will be Arnold Grazer and
Hazel Callahan. in singing and dancing
specialties; a recitation, Henry Irving's
"My Uncle," by Lewis Morrison; the bal
cony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" by
Florence Roberts and White Whlttlesey
of the Alcazar, with special scenery from
that theater; Matthew and Bulger of the
California, in specialties; Henry Miller of
the Columbia; Etta Butler of the Or
pheum- Mary Marble of the California:
George and Josie Cohan of the Cohan
family at the Orpheum; Senor Antonio
Vargas, barytone, and Senorita Augusta
Salvini, soprano, of the Â¦ Olympia;
Matthew Jones of the California; the Nel
son family, from the Chutes, and P. F.
Malley in a club-swinging specialty.
The overture will be the old "Fireman's
March," composed by Charles Â£ cbu ! < V?
over thirty years ago. Mr. Schultz will
lead the orchestra himself while the
march is being played, j
There Is talk also of putting Alice Nell
sen and Edna -Wallace Hopper on the
programme, but It is net known whether
or not they will be available, although it
was reported ' to the managers yesterday
Â¦that they would assist. _
The sale of seats is expected to be very
heavy. "Cards have been out for some
days and a great many have been sold.
These will entitle the holder to a seat
.upon presentation of the. card at the box
office after this morning," There will be a
sample of what is- to be seen at every
theater In the city in the . performance,
and It is expected that people will avail
themselves of the opportunity to see
everything good there is to be seen in the
local theatrical. sky for a single price of
f admission. '
Subscriptions are still coming In and
the fund Is- mounting. It Is the hope of
the Fire Department that there will be
enough to buy a house qJ two flats for the
widow so she can. live in one and live on
the rent of the other, the house to be tied
up In a trust until the youngest child has
.come^of'age. â¢ - . '-? -, .
.Mrs. Townsend has come to the fore
again with- a demand for a large number
of tickets, and with a double charity she
has sent the tickets to General Shafter for
the; soldiers at the Presidio, and she. has
reauested him to allow, the men time and
freedom to attend the performance. In
her letter to Chief Sullivan she says:
< 1121 California street
Chief Dennis T. Sullivan, S. F. Fire Depart
ment Headquarters, Cityâ My Dear Chief Sul
livan: The deed of heroism performed by the
gallant fireman, John Edward Sweeney, has
won the hearty sympathy of every man. woman
and child who has heard of the brave and un
selfish act. Unlike- -the. soldier, who has the
sound of trumpet and drum, with waving ban
ners, to lead him on to the path of duty, the
gallant hero of the Fire Department went fear
lessly to his assigned work and passed to the
hereafter.
The world can show no braver deed than the
one In the performance of which Sweeney met
his death and left behind a sorrowing widow
and four orphans to mourn his loss, a loss
in which San Francisco Joins. In honoring the
brave we must succor the helpless. In addi
tion to the $100 I have already donated I de
sire you to send me 400 tickets, which I wish
for the use of the soldiers stationed at the
*Presl<Jio and other points.
When the Master of the universe shall make
the final roll call may he. in letters of sold,
inscribe the name of John Edward Sweeney,
the hero, who gave his life for another, very
"ncerely yours. ALMIRA 8. TOWNSEND.
June 23. 1900.
And then to General Shafter she -writes,
after repeating her eulogy of Sweeney:,
I have purchased 400 tickets for the use of the
soldiers stationed at the Presidio and other
points and would ask you to grant permission
for the men to attend the performance Friday,
the 29th inst. I cannot but feel that the heroic
deed of the fireman Sweeney should prove a
worthy object lesson to the gallant wearers of
the blue, who py their presence will at least
express their sympathy for this unselfish hero s
family. Very "incerely g yours g . TOWXSENDl

The case out of which these serious ac
cusations arise is a peculiar one. Wong
Mei, the Chinese over whom the Federal
scandal has arisen, arrived at. this port on
the City of Peking and claimed to be a
returning merchant. He had a certificate
to that effect, but after investigation he
was refused a landing on the ground that
the firm of which he claimed to be a mem
ber had gone out of business and he no
longer had a right to a residence in this
country. Tills decision, which construed
his misfortune as a merchant into a rea
son for depriving him of a landing, was
strenuously resisted by his attorney, LÂ»y
man I. Mowry.
The attorney declared that he intend
ed to appeal from the Collector of the
Port to the Secretary of the Treasury,
and pending that appeal he demanded
and, it Is announced, received from the
Collector of the Port an order guarantee-
Ing that the Chinese would not be de
ported until his case had finally been de
termined by the Secretary of the Treas
ury.
Chief Dunn, it Is charged, violated this
order of his superior officer and deported
the Chinese on the steamer China, which
sailed from this port on June 22.
The charges against him followed, and
It Is expected that there will be Interest
ing developments. It may be that the en
tire operation of the Chinese Bureau will
become a matter of citlclal inquiry. In
which the public may learn much of In
terest. - â¢-

Mrs. Israel Tennebaum Will Moke a
Formal Complaint to Superin

Mrs. Israel Tennebaum, 558 Mission

terday to make a complaint as to the
treatment to which she alleged ner
daughter' Rosie, 18 years of age, had be^n
subjected by an attendent at the Agnews
Asylum. The Â£irl was sent there No*

"1 went to the asylum yesterday," said
Mrs. Tennebaum, "to see my daughter.
She had a pair of black eyes, and when
I aslct'd her what was the matter she
said that one of the attendants had tieo.
herin a chair, gagged her and beaten her.
I examined her body and she was covÂ»
ered with black and blue marks. I com
plained to Drs. Crane and Stocking, and
they told me that my girl had done it
herself. I told them what she had stated
to me and said it was impossible that
she could have made the marks herself.
I wanted to take her away with tne, but
thev would not let me."
Mrs. Tennebaum was unable to see any
of the Commissioners, but she was ac
vised to write to Dr. Hatch, superintend
ent of the asylum, and make a formal
complaint to him, so that the matter
might be fully investigated.

THE number of vessels that have met j
disaster In the rush to Nome is yet )
to be learned. Many of thorn are yet j
to be heard from, and while some of
thom are assuredly safe .others must have
had a hard time of H.
The barks Alaska and John and 'Win
throp were among the first to leave here
â¢with passengers for the gold fields in the !
frozon north. Both vessels were com- j
mar.ded by captains whcsÂ«? entire lives al- j
most have boon spent in the Arctic Ocean. ;
They know all about the icefields and the j
â¢way to get through an opening in the j
pack, and the chances are if they are not \
at Nome City now they are within strik
ing distance of the golden beach.
Some of the vop^^ls that left here have
met with great difficulties. The brig Pit
cairn put into Dutch Harbor early in the
season, and there the pafsscngers deposed
the captain and put the first mate in his
place. On the steamer Zealandia the re ;

tine Catherine Sudden is likely to prove a
total loss. Her crew abandoned her and
took refuge on the brig Pltcalrn. while
the revenue cutter Bear went to the as
sistance cf the barkentine and was also
caught In the ice. Latest reports from the

Catherine Sudden, though dismasted and

Mrs. Gaston is the daughter of "Chief"

Mail Steamers Due.
The Toyo Kisen Kaisha's steamer Nip
pon Maru and the Oceanic Steamship
Company's Moana are both schr-dulod to
nrriv<- from Honolulu nf>xt Friday. The
Moana comes from Australia via New
Zealand and Samoa, while the Nippon
M.iru comes from China via Japan. Both
sttamers are due at Honolulu on the same
day and as neither of them can bring
pa spongers or freight from the islands
there should be no delay and an inter*
efting race to San Francisco should re
sult. Given a fair start and both vessels
in good trim the Moana should get here
first.
Naval Bcservo Will Entertain.
The members of the Naval Reserve bat
talion are making great preparations for
the entertainment of their friends aboard
I the Marion on the Fourth of July. The
boys expect to spend the night of July 3
aboard the vessel, and are to take part in
the parade next day. Refreshments will
be served on board during the morning
and afternoon, and a brass band will be
In attendance to furnish music for the
dancers and to give a concert in the even
ing. Cards of invitation will be issued to
members for their families and friends.
Water Front Notes,
The schooner Honoipu will load lumber
on Puget Sound for Noumea, New Cale
donia- This is one of the first loads of
pine ever sent to the French penal set
tlement from the Pacific Coast.
The schooner Compeer has been char,
tered by Healy, Tibbitts & Co. and will
take over a dredging plant, machinery
and a lot of material for the Govern
ment wharf at Pago Pago, Samoa. The
now naval station is nearing completion
and Mr. Tibbitts expects to pee the work
completed this ypar. 1 The Compeer will
sail on July 15 and Mr. Tibbitts and
twenty-five workmen will follow on the
mail steamer Alameda in August next.
The "overdue" British ship Hillston is
bound to South America, and not to Port
Townsend. The 10 per cent rate of rein
surance is therefore not warranted.
Moraprhan (the only one) gives his us
ual annual excursion to the "oyster beds"
on Sunday, July 15. The steamer Eliza
beth and the plungers Dandy and Boxei
will carry the invited guests. Those who
know Moraghan know what to expect,
and the order "wear your old clothes and
bring your oyster knives" is sufficient no
tice for them.

James L#. Barry, who was known in the
Tennessee regiment at Manila as "Pete,
th6 Tennessee Kid," stepped out of the
Fourth-street entrance to the Cafe Royal
yesterday morning and, taking a bottle
of laudanum out of his pocket, swallow
ed the contents. He threw the empty bot
tle into the saloon and shouted as he fell
to the sidewalk, "I've done it now."
An ambulance was summoned and he
was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where JDrs. Bunnell and Roche adminis
tered the usual antidotes and Harry was
soon pronounced out of danger. Iie_ve
hemently denied taking the poison ami
wanted it understood that he was a gen
tleman and in temporary dilllculties.
Barry belongs to l^ebatlion, Tenn., where
his people are in good circumstances. He
came here with the Tennessee regiment
and, taking his discharge at Manila, re
maied there, as he hart become, as" Jie
imagined, an adept at the game of pokfer^
He played with success and came here
some months ago with about $3000 in his
pockets. . The gambling spirit was on him
and during the day he played the races
and at night tried his luck at poker in
the Cafe Royal.
Barry's Rood luck forsook him and he
gradually lost all his money. He had been
stopping: with a friend, Chester Berry, at
142 Powell street, and yesterday morning
borrowed a coat and vest from the last
named. He went to a pawnshop and hy
pothecated his own coat and vest and
with the proceeds bought a bottle of laud
anum and had several drinks. Later he
met Berry at Powell and Ellis streets and
told him to call at the Cafe Royal In a
few minutes and he "would get his coat
and vest, as he would have no further
use for them.
Barry went straight to the Cafe Royal
and In the dramatic -manner described
swallowed the laudanum. He is 22 years
of age and, it is said, has quite a sum
of money coming to him from his father's
estate. He will be sent home as soon as
his friends can be communicated with. 1
