These messages were considered by the .Cabinet to indicate that there is need for immediate rein

With this army in the field there can be no doubt of the prompt establishment of peace

Hay was formally notified to-day that there is.complete accord between the powers in regard to
China, and that assurances have been given this and the French governments that, the' troops
sent into the empire will be employed only for the establishment and preservation of Qrder. While
gratified that these assurances have been given, officials do not forget the possibility that the

troops, to .Taku than those sent by Russia or any other power, and that: the concert of action may

FOREIGN RESIDENTS ARE

LONDON, June 23.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai, dated yesterday, says:
"Intelligence has been brought by the
United States gunboat Nashville that the
foreign quarter at Tientsin was bombard
ed on Tuesday by Generals Nieh. Tung
Fuh Slang. Kand Su and Tuan Shu Kal.
The result of the fighting Is not known.
"The foreign residents are confined to a
restricted district, and as food and water
are scarce they have suffered greatly.
"The Ton Shan mines at Pieh-Tai-Ho
were abandoned by the soldiers, and the
rioters flooded the mines and ruined the
machinery." _â¢ '
LONDON. June 23. 3 a. m.â The silence of Peking continues unbroken. Four
thousand men of the allied forces were having sharp defensive fighting at
Tientsin on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a prospect of being reinforced en
Thursday. This is the situation Sn China as set forth in the British Govern
ment dispatch.
"Eight hundred Americans are taking part In the fighting at Tientsin."
says the Shanghai correspondent of the Dally Express, cabling last evening, "and
they apparently form a part of a supplementary force, arriving, with the Germans
and British .after, the conflict started. It Is Impossible to estimate the number of
Chinese' there, but they had a surprising number of gun*."
This information appears to ltave becjh. brought by the United States gunboat
Nashville , to . Chef u and telegraphed thence to Shanghai. The Chinese are desert
ing Shanghai In large numbers and going Into the Interior. Reports from native
sources continue to reach Shanghai of anarchy in Peking. According to thesa
tales the streets are filled day and night with Boxer3. vho are wholly beyond the
control of the Chinese troops and who are working themselves up to a frenzy and
clamoring, for the death of all foreigners.
The English consulate at Shanghai Is said to have received from influential na
tives reports of a tragedy In the palace at Peking, though precisely what Is not
defined. The consulate thinks that Admiral Seymour, commanding the interna
tional relief column, was misled by Information from Peking, and consequently
underestlmatsd the difficulties In his way and the Chinese power of resistance with
Maxim guns and Mausers.
The Consuls at Shanghai still believe the foreign Ministers at Peking safe, al
though Japanese reports received at Shanghai allege that up to June 15 100 for
eigners had been killed In Peking.
The Daily Kxpress says: "We understand that Reginald Thomas Tower, sec
retary of the British embassy In "Washington, is to succeed Sir Claude Macdonald
at Peking, and that the reason of Sir Claude's recall is the breakdown to hla
health."
A special dispatch from Vienna says: "Li Hung Chang has wired the various
Chinese legations In Europe directing them to Inform the Governments to which
they are accredited that he Is called to Peking by the Empress to act as interme
diary between. China and the powers to negotiate a settlement of the points at Is
sue, and he instructs them to beg the powers to facilitate his mission by ceasing
to send troops to China."
Sheng, Director General of Telegraphs, wires from Shanghai to the Chinese le
gations iii Europe that the foreign legations In Peking are safe.
It is reported that the British Government will send KflO marines to China, and
possibly, according to some of the morning papers, 10,000 of the regulars now with
Lord Roberts.

LONDON*, June 22.â Lord Salisbury pre
sided this morning at a meeting of the
Cabinet especially summoned to consider
the Far Eastern crisis. Prior to the meet-
Ing the French Embassador, M. Paul
Cambon. and the Chinese Minister.
Chih Chen Lo Feng- Luh, paid a lengthy
visit to the officials of the Foreign Office,
and It is expected that important develop
ments* will be the outcome of the Cabinet
conference, as Lord Salisbury proceeded
to Windsor after the meeting.
The apprehensions as to the fate of the
Europeans cut off at Tientsin have been
sharpened by Admiral Kcmpff's message,
which was the first definite announcement
of the bombardment and destruction of
the foreign concessions. But in spite of
Shanghai's grim statement that the Chi
nese used forty-pounders and that 1500
foreigners were massacred, there Is no
reason to conclude that the foreign colony
has been unable to protect Itself. A
Shanghai dispatch reports that Tientsin
was bombarded for two fays, that the
casualties were 100, that 5tfÂ» International
troops are there and that now that the
ailied commanders at Taku are hastily
pushing forward a relief column It Is
hoped the. worst apprehensions will soon
be dispelled. Â¦ ; â¢"
Another Shanghai dispatch announces
that all the members of the foreign com
munity of Pel Tal'Ho, including thirty
three Americans, have arrived at Chefu
on board the Nashi-llle. but they left all
their possessions behind them.
A dispatch, from Shanghai under this
afternoon's date pays five Chinese war
ships passed Woo Sung to-day, and that
officers of tlje British armored cruiser Un
daunted visited the Chinese commanding
officer and received an. assurance that the
rhips were under orders to act against
any Boxer. rising. The superintendent of
foreign telegraphs has started for Chefu
to organize a service thence to Shanghai.
It is understood the Admiralty has re
ceived a dispatch from the British naval
commander in Chinese waters on the sub
ject of the heavy damage done to the for
eign concessions at Tientsin and the cas
ualties of the International forces. This
has net yet been published.
The Admiralty sent orders to Ports
mouth and Plymouth this morning to hold
detachments of marine artillery and In
fantry in instant readiness for service in
China.
It is thought in some quarters that LI
Hung Chang's failure to go to Peking In
dicates that he is aware that the situa
tion Is bo bad that it is Impossible for him
to overcome the difficulties.
RUSSIA'S STAND IN
THE CHINESE CONFLICT
ST. PETERSBURG. June 22.â The view
expressed by both the press and politi
cians here is that Russia should make
common caus> e with the powers In meet-
Ing the common danger In China. It.ls
pointed out, however, that when once the
time arrives to settle the Chinese ques
tion, Russia must regulate her true inter
ests, which differ greatly from those of
the other powers and prevent her more
particularly from definitely embarking: in
hostilities against the vast Chinese em
pire, her neighbor. This Is also under
stood to be the Government view of the
situation. - â¢ â¢ j
BRITISH TROOPS READY
FOR CHINESE SERVICE
UNTTSUAL. significance Is attached to the departure on the steamship China
yesterday of Homer Lea, a Stanford student, who for some time past has
been acting as the secret agent on this coast of the Po Wong Woi, or the
ecdety for the reformation of the Chinese empire. It is believed that Lea
has in his possession about $5>),ooo collected in this country by the Chinese
Empire Reform Association, a branch of the Po Wong Wol, which Is to be
used in outfitting an army intended to support Quongr Su. the young- Emperor, In
overthrowing- the Krnprcf s Dowager, who Is now in control of the Government.
Less than a week ago a dispatch was received at the headquarters of the local
Bocitiy-t^ftn Kvng Yu Wei. president of the I*o Wong- Wol, which rmd a~si'fGSJ<TWs: Â¦
"'"One of the commanders of the'Chinese forces killed. Send money at once to
Singapore." ->.-/.*. ., ~ .'i"-. r 7
For many months Lea. who is only 24 years of agÂ«?, has been working hand
and glove, with the members of the local reform association, who teemed, for some
reason, to repose exeat confluence in him. His ambition, frankly stated, has been
to become a commanding general in the Chinese reformers' army. The story of his
life and ambition was recently published in The Call and attracted wide attention.
Since that time he has received hundreds of letters from American and English
army officer*, both cctive and retired, asking for enlistment under his banner.
Many of his fellow-students at Stanford, it is stated on reliable authority, and at
least cr.e professor, have agreed tc follow him to China when the call comes.
POWERS ARE AGREED
AS TO THREE POINTS
BERL.TN", June 22.â The commander of
the German squadron at Taku vrircd as
follows to the Government:
"A French oflccr who arrived here from
Tientsin, which he loft June 20, reports
that for three Jays the city had been bom
l>arfied bjr the Chinese and that the troops
cf the foreign detachment were short of
'ammunition.
"The German cruiser Irene has arrived
here with 240 marine:?, who, with 3S0 Brit
ish and 1500 Russians, proceeded to the
relief of Tientsin. The railway is work
ing from Taku to within fifteen kilometers
Whether the powers interested in China
â¢will ultimately reach an agreement re
garding concerted action, it fems to be
certain, judging from the result's of inves
tigations made to-day, that no such agree
ment has been i cached. The tame Ft-ries
of questions were put successively to the
German Foreign Office and to the Russian
and French embassies. The German For
cigTi Office Â»said:
"The powers just now are agreed as to
three points onlyâ the- relief of Tientsin
and PtkiujT. adequate fatisfaction for the
severe injuries European interest? have
sustained and the establishment of guar
antees against a repetition of such out
rages. Beyond this the attitude of the
powers will largely depend upon what has
really happened at Peking, which is still
inknown to Europe."
The reply of the Russian Embassadot.
Count Osten-Sacljen. was substantially the
came as that of the German Foreign Of
flce except- on two points. The Embassa
<3or said with much emphasis:
"The intervention of the powers in China
must, under no condition?, mean a settle?
ment by wax of old scores with the Chi-
r ..-sÂ«- Government and must not embrace.
governmental reorganization. - Especially
it rnust not Include a change in the head
of the Government. Even if the Chinese
end the international armies come into
collision, these considerations must never
be lost sight of."
The French Embaspador. Marquis de
Noallles, expressed a different v*ew. While
eubstantlally coinciding with the pro
gramme of the German Foreign Office he
Insisted that the removal of the Empress
Dowager and her clique would be neces
sary to secure the permanent results
which the powers desire.
The Washington Government several
days aÂ£o inquired through United States
Embassador White regarding the where
abouts snd safety of a number of Ameri
can missionaries located within the Ger
man fiphere of Influence in Shantung.
Thus far the German Government has
been unable to furnish a satisfactory re
ply. The semi-ofQcial Berliner Post has a
epeclal dispatch from Rome asserting that
the Vatican his applied to the French
Government urgently entreating that
larger reinforcements be sent for the pro
tection of Christians In China. The reply
of the Part* Cabinet, according to this
correspondent. 1? that the matter will be
treated in harmony and solidarity with
the other powers.
The Chinese embassy bavins received
several anonymous letters threatening
vengeance should the news of the murder
of the German Minister In Peking. Baron

to Windsor after the meeting.
The apprehensions as to the fate of the
Europeans cut off at Tientsin have been
sharpened by Admiral Kcmpff's message,
which was the first definite announcement
of the bombardment and destruction of
the foreign concessions. But in spite of
Shanghai's grim statement that the Chi

foreigners were massacred, there Is no
reason to conclude that the foreign colony
has been unable to protect Itself. A
Shanghai dispatch reports that Tientsin
was bombarded for two fays, that the
casualties were 100, that 5tfÂ» International
troops are there and that now that the

yesterday of Homer Lea, a Stanford student, who for some time past has
been acting as the secret agent on this coast of the Po Wong Woi, or the

Empire Reform Association, a branch of the Po Wong Wol, which Is to be
used in outfitting an army intended to support Quongr Su. the young- Emperor, In

reason, to repose exeat confluence in him. His ambition, frankly stated, has been
to become a commanding general in the Chinese reformers' army. The story of his
life and ambition was recently published in The Call and attracted wide attention.
Since that time he has received hundreds of letters from American and English

Whether the powers interested in China

certain, judging from the result's of inves

TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. June 22.â
Concerning the seven propositions made
by the Filipino leaders to the Taft
Philippine Commission as conditions o?
peace, the administration officials declare
that the commission has instructions
Â«vhich will cr.able them to meet all the
Questions raised. Rcfore there can be any
compliance, however, with the ile/nands
of the Filipino leaders, it is said the
smrcFty proclamation must be fully com
plied with.
According to cable advices from Man'la
this miming, the Filipino leaders who
conferred yesterday with General MacAr
thur nnd the Philippine Commission pre
sented this scheme, comprising seven
propositions, as conditions for peace:
First â A general amnesty by both Amer
icans and Filipinos.
Secondâ Return of confiscated property.
Thirdâ For the appointment of Filipino
general otacers in the new militia.
Fourthâ The use of sufficient revenues
of the' islands to relieve the distress of
the impoverished people.
Fifthâ A guarantee of personal rights
according to the American constitution.
Sixthâ The establishment of civil gov
ernment at Manila and in the provinces.
Seventhâ Expulsion of the friars.
One or Two Stumbiing Blocks.
Most of these conditions, it 5Â« said, the
commission will find it easy to mÂ«t, but
the ieaderb v.-ill be impressed by the Com
missioner! that there must be compliance
with the amnt*>ty proclamation before any
of the propositions can be carried into ef
fect, 'iherf will, of course, be no partici
pation in the joint amnesty proclamation
fcuch as proposed by the Filipinos, as that
would be a recognition which the adminis
tration docs not contemplate. But there
Â¦will be no objection to Agruinaldo issuing
his own amnesty proclamation if he de
fires to do so. Nor will it be possible to
comply with the request for the appoint
ment of I'ilipino orticers in the proposed
iiew militia. Tni?, however, can be safely
promised, as General MucArthur has al
ready authority to recruit native battal
ions, and eventually, when it is deemed
safe to do so. Filipino officers may be
commissioned.
, As to the use of i\\e revenues of the isl
ands to relieve the distress of the sufter
inp. tUs :s already being done to a lim
ited extent and may be carried further if
the fun-is will admit.
The ccirmission will find no difficulty in
complying with the request for a guaran
tee of personal rig'hts according to the
American constitution or with the request
for the establishment of a civil govern
ment at Manila and in the provinces.
These fre mattrrs which its instructions
spc-cifjcally contemplate.
The question of the return of confis
cated property and that of the expulsion
of the friars are matters which will slve
the commission th<? most trouble. It Is
iiot fuppr.yfd that thÂ«Â» commission will be
able to expel the friars, as requested by
th<? Filipino leaders, but it was realized
before it left here that this was one of
the greatest problems with which it would
have to deal, end the commission tvas

to them. It is the opinion of officials here
that the friars are the one disturbing ele

to completely establish peace among the
natives.

Altogether this question of the friars

RIGHTS OF FILIPINOS
AS VIEWED BY BRYAN

Colonel AV. J. Bryan. In which ho ex
pMCMfl his views upon the relations of the

It is as follows:
I beUMVe that the rights of the Filipinos and
the rirhts cf the Cubans are identical. The
recognition of the r!ghiÂ£ of the Cubans by reso
lution did not create these rights. They existed
beforo.
If the Filipinos have a right to their Inde
pendence, the fact that they fought for it does
not justify us in carrying on a war of con
quest.
It is no more humiliatlne for a nation to
recoffnize the rights of an opponent than for
We would have had the Fame trouble in
Cuba if we had treated the Cubans the same
as we have the Fillplncp. \\> would have had
no trouble in the Fhillprine^ if we had treated
tile Filipinos as we have treated the Cubans.
If we are going to plve the Filipinos their In
dependence we ought to say so at once and
thus avoid further bloodshed.
How can we justify the sacrifice of American
sc.lditrs and thÂ» killing- of Filipinos merely to
t-how that we can whip them?
The Bacon resolution received the support of
r-early every Democratic Senator and was
adopted by a Democratic caucus In the House.
This resolution promised independence. If It
had been ac<.er>te.t and acted upon when it was
first Introduced there would have been no Fil
ipino war. If it had been adopted at the time
the vote was taken it would have stopped the
war. Very truly yours. VÂ»*. J. BKYAX.

There were four candidates for the nom

third ballot, when the other candidates

is 37 years old.
to abandon the archipelago, and the authorities have not forgotten the reports of this character
spread by Aguinaldo when the withdrawal of volunteers last year was commenced.
Rear Admiral Remey has been informed of Admiral KempfFs needs, and it is expected he
will do all he can to send light draft ships and men "to his subordinate's assistance.
Peking is still isolated. Secretary Hay calls the failure of the United States and other
powers to receive information relative to the condition of affairs in the Chinese capital a great
mystery of the age. Though telegraphic communication has been interrupted, a diplomat pointed
out this afternoon that there are native Christians who could very well be intrusted with dis
patches, and who, disguised as "Boxers," could safely pass through the country between Peking
and Tientsin.
What has become of Vice Admiral Seymour- and his column is another mysterious
feature of the situation. Commander Taussig's dispatch that "the admiral has returned to Tient
sin," has not yet been satisfactorily explained. It is not now believed that Vice Admiral Seymour
was the admiral to whom he referred, and Lord Pauncefote, the British Embassador, who called at
the State Department this afternoon, expressed confidence that Commander Taussig must have
referred to another officer. Lord Pauncefote added that his Government had not advised him of
the receipt of any news from Admiral Seymour or Peking, or any other point in China, but he is
hopeful that the next few days will bring information of the relief of the foreign legations. Lord
Pauncefote is satisfied fliat the large allied force ordered to China will destroy the "Boxer" move
ment and restore peace and order.
Another diplomat who discussed the situation this- afternoon stated that the crushing de
feat of the "Boxers" and their allies would result in the dissolution of other movements of a sim
ilar character throughout China. "Reports received from China," he continued, "show how
greatly, every event is exaggerated. The force of 20,000 that will be sent to China will, when an
nounced in the interior of China, reach the proportions of an army of 200,000 men. A crushing
defeat of the 'Boxers' will dishearten those engaged in this movement, and when once trie
troops commence operations I do not anticipate there will be any great difficulty in putting down
the movement.",
Consul General Goodnow at Shanghai informed the State Department to-day of the ar
rival of two steel cruisers at Shanghai. It is presumed these are British men-of-war, and that
they will remain at that port to protect foreigners and their interests in case they should be
Neither this nor any European Government, according to the American officials, holds
that a state of war exists between. China and the world, as has been frequently reported.
Reports that Minister Wu will be given his passports and that an extra session of Con
gress will be called are declared to be nonsensical. The President feels that he has sufficient au
thority to send troops to China without convening Congress, especially as; their sole purpose in
going to the empire is to protect American life and property, and is not for the purpose of
conquest or invasion. It is the general impressjon that the imperial troops of China are engaged I
in the "Boxer" movement, but even if they are, this will not, according to State Department offi
cials, make any change in their views with respect to the. fighting in. progress at Tientsin and

"WASHINGTON. June 22.-Consul Fow
ler at Chefu, in a supplement to a former
report to the State Department from
Consul General Goorfnow at Shanghai
upon the United States' trade with China,
shows that in four years from lSDti to 1S99.
inclusive, we have doubled our sales with
China. In 1S07 the value of these sales
exceeded those of all Continental Europe
by $320,281; in 1S9S this excess had In
creased to $4,171,934, and .last year to
$6491,936. China Imported American
goods iast year to the value of $li?.2S.Â«.743
and British goods to the value of $^.9C6.
083, five-sixths of the total importation
coming from British and American terri
tory, and more than half from Great
Britain alone.
In the matter of exports, statistics show
that the United States bought more of
China in ISO-) than any other country In
the world. The exports last year were
valued at $13,835,4SÂ»j, our increase of trade
during the year being ten times greater
than Great Britain's for the same period.
Consul Fowler strongly urges a more di
rect method of shipping our goods to
China. Says the Consul: 1
I have seen but one merchant steamer nnd?r
our flag (and she had no right to it) since I
came to China, in February. 1S90. ten years
ago, and it was seven years before I saw a
sailor direct from the United States. About
one-fourth of the American carrying trade of
China last year was done under the United
States Has. while more tban half was under
the British ensisrn. Germany did tea times as
well a3 the United States.
Consul Fowler concludes as follows:
I can see from, my desk six modern Chinese
men of war. all built in Germany or England.

LAKEPORT. June 22.â Rev. Mr. Barbee, a Methodist minister, and" C P
Hathaway, a prominent lawyer, both of Kelseyville, had an altercation in that
town this afternoon in the latter's offle'e. There was a rattling exchange of
blows, resulting in victory for the preacher, who proved himself a fighter of
no mean cahber.
Adjourning to the street after tho fracas, the preacher proclaimed to the
crowd assembled that he was perfectly willing tljat the community should un
derstand that he was a fighter as well as a preacher, and that he intended to
continue his work in Kelseyville and prove the truth of either proposition when
ever occasion demanded.
The tnv.ifcle arose over the personal rtmarks of Barbee from the pulpit
and Hathaway's reply thereto through the public press. Both men show con
siderable facial disngurement as a result of the mill. Lawyer Hathaway was

Denies That Any Portion of the Be-
publican Platform Was Sur
reptitiously Altered.
NEW YORK, June 22.â Lemuel E.
Quige. the New York member of the com
mittee'on resolutions of the National Re
publican Convention at Philadelphia, in
reference to a statement of General C. H.
Grosvenor of Ohio, which was called to
his attention, in effect that certain lan
guage had been agreed upon by a sub
committee, on which Mr. Quigg was sec
retary, to-night gave out the following:
General Grosvenor's statement that some
thing was surreptitiously omitted from the
platform which was "understood by the com
mittee to be a part of the platform la untrue.
He states he makes that statement upon the
authority of Senator Foraker. but that is im
possible. The platform was the work of the
sub-committee of the committee on resolutions
and every member of that sub-committee con
tributed to the work of making the platform
and on every point and every plank the sub
committee was unanimous. It was also unani
mous on all matters suggested but omitted.
It is true that a document was read to the
eub-commlttee by Senator Foraker that con
tained the language General Grosvenor quotes.
That document had been prepared In Washing
ton, but the committee considered that it was
much too long and that It too much resembled
a political essay. The points made In that
document, however, were fully discussed dur
ing a session of nearly five hours' duration. At
the end of the session I waa elected secretary
of the sub-committee and required to put to
gether the planks upon which the agreement
had been reached.
I did this and the committee met again at
1 o'clock on Wednesday morning and went
over what I had written-, word for word. My
draft was altered in many details and every
such alteration received the approval of every
member of the sub-committee. We then took
up other planks of minor importance, and after
full discussion, conclusions were reached aa to
each of them and I was requested to make a
draft of the minor planns. I worked on that
the rest ofthe night and at 7 o'clock Senator
Fairbanks came to my room. Together we went
over the comoleted platform from the first
word to the last. The sub-committee met again
at 9 o'clock, and the document, with such
changes as Mr. Fairbanks had suggested, was
read in full.
The !anftunee of the two planks to whlCTi
General Grosver.or referred was then precisely
Jn the form in which it was read to the con
vention In the afternoon. The sub-commltteÂ»
had considered Jus-t how far It would go In
giving countenance to subsidies to the shipping
interests and the language adopted was its
deliberate and final Judgment.
As to the statement "that Congress has full
legislative power over the territory belonging
to the United States, subject only to the funda
mental safeguards of liberty. Justice and per
sonal rights," the committee considered that
Inasmuch as this question waa now before the
United States Supreme Court It was neither
advisable nor necessary to run the risk of
getting our platform into a controversy with
the Supreme Court. But we did say that It
waa the duty of the Government to put down
armed Insurrection in the Philippines and that
as to the people of Â»U the territories acquired
by war," "the largest measure of self-govern
ment consistent with their welfare and our
duties rhall be secured to them by law."
This plank was fully debated and deliberated
and unanimously agreed upon, and no man has
any authority to say that one word was put in
or left out surreptitiously. The platform as
prepared by the sub-committee was read to the
full committee, was there debated for two
hour*, and, with a few alterations, one of
which related to the two planks referred to

f*\ EATTL.E, Wash., June 22.â Accord-
L Ing to the latest details received re-
garding the injury to iluir Glacier
w J by * ne recent earthquake. Its lmpos
*"^ing grandeur Is still unmarred. al
though thousands of tons of ice have
sloughed off its face. This Information
comes from Captain David Wallace, mas
ter of the steamship Queen, which re
turned Wednesday from an excursion
voyage to Alaska.
Captain Wallace, as has oeÂ«n his cus
tom for the past sixteen or eighteen years,
sought to line up his ship across the face
of the glacier, but for the first time In
nearly two decades he scored a failure. Ho
was unable, owing to a great field of float
ice. to get the vessel closer than five
miles from Alaska's wondrous attraction,
whose scenic beauties have been gazed
upon and admired by tourists from the
length and breadth of the land.
"1 never saw so much Ice." Captain
Wallace said last night, discussing the
strange phenomenon. "Forty-five miles
out from the glacier -we encountered stray
chunks of float and they gradually grew
thicker and thicker until closer approach
to the glacier was impossible. We got
within five miles of It and could go no
further. The ice Â¦was packed so solid that
one could not Jam a stick of stovewood
between the cakes, which in some In
stances rose 100 feet above the surface of
the water.
"To tell the truth, when we we're there
It seemed so jammed that one cannot even
make a prediction when the bay will clear
and permit close approach to the great
glacier. I think, however, that old Mulr
still retains Its beauty. We took the
glasses and viewed it as best -we could
at such a distance. The aea front seemed
to stand out In bold perpendicular form
as of yore, but the jagged float ice rose
up. obstructing the view.'"

Steyn's forces In the Orange River

. most of the attention of Lord Rob

Transvaal and the Orange River colony
â¢was completed yesterday as Lord Roberta
said It would be* by the arrival of Gen
eral Buller's advance guard under Lord
Dundonald at Standerton. The net around
the 6000 or S00O men under General Steyn
will now contract. Adroit maneuvering
and brisk fighting are likely to take place,
because until all resistance south of the

INSURES LOVE AND A HAPPYOARSMEN ARE INACTIVE.
Affairs are quiet among the oarsmen
just now. There Is no association regatta
in prospect until September. The citizens'
Fourth of July celebration/ committee will
make no appropriation for rowing prizes
this year, so the proposed combined re
gatta of the Ariel. Pioneer and South End
clubs at Long Wharf has been abandoned.
The rowing regatta committee of the*
semi-centennial celebration of the Native
Sons, however. Invited a representative
from each rowing club to attend Its meet
ing at the Palace Hotel, Â«nd it was then
decided that the rowing events shall be
held under the joint management of the
regatta committee and the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union.
The races will be over a course extend
ing three-quarters of a mile in a south
erly direction /rom Channel street and re.
turn, and will bo for the championship of
1900. This course will insure reasonably
smooth water and will enable a large
number of spectators to view the races.
The events to be contested will be the se
nior and junior shell championships, the
senior and Junior outrigger skiff cham
pionships and the senior, intermediate and
junior barge championships. There will
also be a nava! militia cutter race â an
event that has always produced a keen
contest and much interest among the
spectators. The members of the Naval
Reserve at Eureka. Santa Cruz and San

take part in the cutter race. â¢ j .
KENNEL CLUBS ORGANIZE.'
The specialty clubs of the Pacific Coast
have learned the lesson that unity is
strength, and at the meeting held on Mon
day last a proposition was mooted by the
delegate of the Pacific Mastiff Club that
appeared to find favor with the delegates
of the other clubs represented at the meet-
Ing. The proposition was the formation of
an association of the clubs for the purpose
of securing united action toward the dif
ferent bench, shows of the coast. The
Pacific Bull Terrier Club, the Pacific Fox
Terrier Club, the Pacific Mastiff Club and
the St. Bernard Club of California have,
through their delegates, already given
their support to the proposal, and It is
hoped the California Collie Club will also
fall in tp llney The association will natur
ally _be a strong one. The* choice of the
delegates. for president was unanimously
in fjvvor of J. B. Martin, who has done so
mucn in furthering the unity of the clubs.
All that remains to be settled- to make
thÂ»- association an accomplished fact Is
Â¦the proportion of the contribution â¢ from
each club to defray the small running ex
penses of the association. RIcJiard Roun
tree will probably be elected secretary. ..
, E. M. Simpson, the delegate of the bench
show committee of the Sacramento State
Fair' Association, returned from his trip
to San Jose well pleased with the prom
ises of support that he received there from
the fanciers. 1 The members of the Collie
Club of California gave him a hearty re
ception,.â¢" and -will > probably -put into -the
judging ring as large a contingent as has
ever been exhibited In California. The feel
ing of dissatisfaction with the American
Kennel. Club has ; died out completely
among 'the members . of the Collie t Club,
who have been, the mainstay and back
bone of the Pacific Kennel League. It is
probable that with the defection of this
important and : enthusiastic club-the last
show under the rules of the league has
been held in California. '
ON THE CRICKET PITCH.
The Californlas sdored a creditable vic
tory over the Alameda cricketers last
Sunday, but there was a considerable
element of luck in the match. Four of
the best Alameda -batsmen were dismissed
for nine runs and the best Â¦work on the
California team was done by J. Guild (42
runs), A. D. Reynolds (44 runs) and W, H.
Howard, who captured five wicket3. The
last two added greatly to the strength of
the winning team.
To-morrow the Callfornias will meet the
Pacifies. As the Alamedas on the 11th
inst. beat the Pacific eleven by 44 runs for
a loss of only eight wickets and the Call
fornias beat the Alamedas by 110 runs,
there would seem to be little doubt of the
result: but paper forecasts of a cricket
match are often upset. The California
team will be chosen from: Arthur Dicken

CYCLE PATH IDEA
CATCHES WHEELMEN
Nothing in cycling hereabouts has cre
ated so much interest for' a long
time past ' as the proposed cycle
path from this city to San Ma
teo. The movement is being heartily
encouraged by the riders, dealers and
clubs and cannot fail of success. The
committee, on organization met Wednes
day at the office of E. B. Learning, vice
president of the â¢ California Associated
Cyclists, who with T. G. Splllane and Jo
seph. Holle composed the committee. They
formulated a constitution and by-laws,
recommending the name to. be San Fran
cisco Cycle Path Association. The execu
tive committee suggested is composed of
Frank H. Kerrigan, Charles Albert
Adams, W. J. Kenny, Clarence N. Rav
lin, R. M. Welch, S. G. Scovern, William
IVlackie, J. W. Leavitt and H. W. Spald
ing.
These nomination, together with the
constitution and by-laws, will be submit
ted to the meeting of delegates to be held
nexX Tuesday evening In tnÂ»-rooms of the
Cycle Board of Trade, Parrott building,
for approval.
Regarding the proposed officers of the
association, many prominent cyclers will
urge E. B. Learning to accept the presi
dency, although he in his modesty left
himself off the executive committee. Mr.
Learning is eminently fitted for the posi
tion, and if he can be prevailed upon to
accept it the association will be well
pleased. Robert M. Welch is willing to
re-enter the cycling arena as treasurer of
the path fund, and this announcement
will be hailed with gladness by the old
guard.
The cycle path fever has struck San

FIRST AND LAST
TEAMS WILL MEET
Manager Harris Is. Full of Hope and
Expects His Men to Forge
Through the Bunch.
Sacramento still leads in the California
Baseball League by a comfortable mar
gin, Stockton being In second place, the
Dudes getting show money and the, local
team a bad fourth. Conditions are' such
that a succession of victories extending
over two weeks by the Dudes and the lo
cal clubs would group the four teams In
close positiorfs. . .
Manager Harris' "Pretzel" team has
struck a pace of confidence and the work
done by them on the field shows marked
Improvement. Last. Saturday at Sacra
mento with the invincible Hughes on the
slab for the champions Uncle's men
swung the stick with great effect. It
was not only at the bat that the local
nine distinguished itself. The support
given the pitcher was of the best. Man
ager Harris never had a better Infield
than he has now. Pabst covering the in
itial sack, Schwartz at second and Reilly;
at third, with Reitz working at short,
make an infield that is gilt-edged. Some
of the men are new to their positions as
far as this season goes, having been play
ed in different places. They will remain
where they are, however, and this
should mean a few victories for San
Francisco.
Oakland had a chance last week to ad
vance a step and send Manager Harper's
crew closer to the trailers. But this was
not to be, and Stockton by winning the
afternoon game of the series advanced
its percentage, lowering that of tne
Dudes.
Manager Ewlng's team has been dis
rupted by the defection of players from
the ranks. His first loss was that of
Schmeer and Hammond, who signed with
the Butte team for a short season. Since
their arrival In the Montana city Schmeer
and Hammond have been using their In
fluence to persuade other Oakland players
to join them. Dunleavy has quit the
ranks of the. Dudes, and it is whispered
that Stfeffani will do the eame. . "When
Schmeer and Hammond quit Manager
Ewing's ranks the Oakland infield was in
a chaotic state. Since Arrellanes donned
the Dudes' uniform at the middle sta
tion and Francks was sent to short field
that team has been relieved somewhat
from the sudden changes made: in the
file. Old Pop Hardie will go back to his
place at right. Should StefEani withdraw.
Oakland's force -of twirlers will consist
of Borchers and Beville, two good men,
but eccentric at times. .
The league has at last aroused Itself to
this sudden power In the Northwest that
reaches out its tentacles and grasps the
best local material. It is the intention of
the California League management to bar
a.11 players from the league if they desert
the local ranks to go East in the middle
of the season. This may have a deterrent
effect and prevent the destruction of
teams in the middle of the season when
the men are working together. . ..'
Last Sunday at Recreation Park there
was an old-time mob in the bleachers
and they made it-more than luke-warm
for Umpire Graves and Fred Lange, the
third baseman of the Dudes. Why Lange
should be specially selected as the butt of
scornful and derisive hoots and hisses of
the crowd Is hard to tell: He is a con
scientious player, behaving in a gentle
manly fashion on the field and off, never
looking for conspicuous display or special
manifestation of praise from the specta
tors. Yet he was signaled for a mean
outpouring, of censure from the Stockton
section a week ago. Lange made a mis
take by noticing it. As he is but human,
he ought to be excused- for this much.
The noisy mart nlto came all the. way
from* Stockton to make trouble succeeded

TROUT FISHING IN
THE L0KE REGION
IS flT ITS BEST
From all over the State come reports
which indicate that the fishing condition
oi . the mountain lakes and streams is
rapidly attaining its highest development.
The Jakes of the Tahoe district, the
Truckee River, Upper McCloud and Mon
terey Bay are nearly all at their, best.
The Truckee, favorite stream of a host of
metropolitan anglers, will continue to im
prove for some time to come. The reports
from Webber are most encouraging to
the men who make an annual pilgrimage
to that gem of the mountains. The season
has opened auspiciously. * Mr. Andrews
caught a bro*<n trout some days since
weighing Z\? pounds. This is pronounced
by Captain Burton the finest specimen of
that variety ever taken from the lake.
Every one la catching trout at Tahoe,
Tallac. McKinneys and Tahoe Qity. It is
a little early for fishing tn the vicinity of
Glen Alpine, although the lakes there
should be at their best about July 1.
Fred Colegrove of Boca is authority for
the statement that fishing at that point
on the Truckee is good. Mr. Fountain
secured a dozen trout with the fly be
tween 5 and 8 p. in. on the 18th inst. >\ .
O. Fas-sett of Verdi says fishing at that
point has been good in the early morning
and evening for some weeks past, the
catches running from ten to fifteen
pounds. N There has been some loggiag in
the river during the past month, but the
run is said to be over. Wherever the
river is high it is also clear.
W. S. Tevis came down from Tahoe on
Wednesday. He purposed returning to his
fishing lodge on the lake to-day.
A. T. Vogelsang, president of the Fish
CommlsFion. went to Tahoe on Wednes
dav to insDect the Tahoe and Tallac
hatcheries. He will also inspect the hatch
ery in the Truckee before he returns.
A. S. Carman goes to Cisco to-day. He
will remain some time fishing the south
fork of the Yuba Kiver and the lakes in
that vicinity. The Yuba is pronounced
one of the best of the July streams. The
lakes in the vicinity of Cisco will afford
splendid sport this season. They have
been liberally stocked during the past
three years with rainbow, mykiss. Loch
Leven 'and brown trout. This is the first
year they have been open to anglers. It
was not "generally known heretofore that
the lakes had been stocked.
John L. Howard, 'Alex Hermann, John
and Bush Finnell of this city and F. E.
Johnson of Napa have just returned from
a fishing and shooting pilgrimage into Te
hama County. The principal part of their
time was spent on Toms Creek. During
the latter part of their trip they went to
the north fork of the Eel River, in the
vicinity of Windy Mountain. They_ se
cured three bears and one panther. The
latter measured nine feet from tip to tip
and was secured only after a desperate
struggle.
Robert Tolmie, accompanied by a party
of friend?, has gone to his lodge on Trin
ity River. Mr. Tolmie will spend the sum
mer there. The fishing is good ajid on the
oiKning of the deer season it will present
the best field In the State.
Fred Johnson sent John Butler a basket
of fifty splendid trout from Lake Inde
pendence." In addition to this evidence of
an abundance of fish he writes that he is
enjoying great sport with the gamy trout.
Professor Rops of Leland Stanford Jr.
University left early in the week for the
McCloud with k party of friends for an
extended fishing trip.
M. L. Cro?s of the Fish Commission re
turned from Wawona on Wednesday. He
reports the season at the hatchery as one
of the most successful in its history- The
fishing In Crer-cent, Ostrander and other
lakes near Wawona is said to be the beÂ«t
in years. All the anglers who wet a line
in them bring back creels full of fine fish,
the Eiv-tern brook trout being the most
conspicuous.
Salmon fishing in Monterey Bay in the
vicinity of Santa Cruz continues good.
The catches made last Sunday are said
to have been the largest since 1R33.
Striped bass fishing in Oakland estuary
last Sunday and during the present week
has been uncertain and irregular. Few
fi?h were caught on Sunday, although sev
eral good catches have been made since.
. Horace Smyth, secretary of the San
Francisco FJy-casting Club, returned from
an extended European trip on Wednesday.
He will be banqueted by his fellow-mem
bers nc-xt Tuesday. They anticipate a
pleasant gathering, as Mr. Smyth is ex
pected to tell what he has gleaned about
fly fishing in Europe and possibly on the
Nile.
Frank Orr goes to Independence Lake
on July 1 for two weekp.
TWO HUNDRED OF
THE FLEETEST OF
DOGS WILL START
Open Stages at Both Parks
f-Ittract Great Grey
hounds.
Over two hundred greyhounds will ap
pear in the competition at lngieside
Coursing Park and at Union Coursing
Park this week. Many of the fliers which
performed in the ladies' day champion
stake are again entered at Union Park.
These include For Glory, Fine Fire, Royal
Flush, Rural Artist, Whitehead and oth
ers. Palo Alto and Beacon, winner and
runner-up respectively for the rich stake,
are being allowed to rest, as they turned
up sore after their exertions last week.
The sport will commence to-day at Union
Park upon the arrival of the 10:15 a, m.
train and at lngieside at 12:30.
The second payment on the California
Futurity, to be decided on Admission day,
will become due on July 1. Out of the 276
puppies originally listed the tirst payment
nas been made on 164. It is expected the
stake will be worth fully $1600 to the win
ner. All greyhounds vvnelped in 1S99 are
eligible.
The California Coursing Committee has
received notification of the action taken
by the field stewards at Ingleslde Park in
the case of Joseph Bradsnaw, manager,
and A. C. Bradbury, trainer, for Joseph
Watkins. The men have been ruled off
the field for life, while the dogs Merciful.
Merciless and Gladiator will not be al
lowed to -compete lor six months. Final
action in the case will be taken at the next
meeting ol the Coursing Committee, when
the lngieside field stewards will undoubt
edly be sustained.
T. Murnane has a litter of puppies by J.
Seggerson's Gold Hill and out of Valley
Maid.
Bertram & Commins of Modesto have a
litter of puppies by their dog King Craft

Russell, Allen & Wilson have added
Magic to their big collection of grey
hounds, having obtained him by purchase
from J. R. Smith.
Pasha Kennels will start their imported
greyhound Real Lassie to-day at Union
Park. She is by Cocoa Wine-Here and
There, and is expected to show high class
form. Since her arrival here from Eng
land she has whelped a fine litter xÂ»f pup
pies by Royston, a noted English sire.
Owing to this fact it is doubtful if she
will show her true form the first time out.
James Dean's Brilliantine has beerÂ»
mated with R. E. de B. Lopez & Son's im
ported* dog Shylock. Brilliantine is pro
nounced one or the most beautiful grey
hounds in America, and much is expected
of her progeny.
Ed Fisher of Stockton has mated his
greyhound Race Away with Prince of
Fashion. Race Away Is by Emin Pasha-
Minnehaha. while Prince of Fashion is a
half-brother, to Lowe & Thompson's
Prince Hal.
M. Monasch's Golden Finch has been
bred to J. H. Burfeind's Royal Prize.
O'Connell Bros.' Mamie Pleasant and
Mr. Robinson's Lawrence Belle have been
bred to Pasha Kennels' Emin Pasha..
Fortuna Favente, brother of Fabulous
Fortune, and the most celebrated grey
hound ever brought to this country, has
been mated with Pasha Kennels' Fair
Helen, dam of Craig Boy and other good
greyhounds. This signalizes the big dog's
entrv to the stud In this country.
Will Thompson of the coursing firm of
Ix)we & Thompson, is expecting two grey
hounds, brothers of Society Belle, from
Kansas. They will start in the California
Futurity, to be run In September. Mr.
Thompson's most promising candidate for
honors in this rich stake is Pink of Fash
ion. At present he is retired, owing to an
encounter with barbed wire-fencing. Flora
McDonald and Little Fullerton are also
out of the running on the same account.
Captain Cane won the open stake at
Ingleslde and the reserve stake at Union
Park last Sunday, the former with Miss
Penman and the latter with Greenhall.
The captain has been particularly fortu
nate in his short career on the coursing
field, as he has a small kennel.
John Halton. manager of Union Cours
ing Park, left on Thursday for a short
sojourn at the springs. He is trying to
shake off a heavy cold which had him in

I lot Foot, which worked his way into the
deciding course last Wednesday.
David < "Winders, who Is making so
marked a success with the dogs in his
charge, avails of the most modern ideas
in conditioning the dogs. Tn addition to
the massage, which all handlers give their
dogs after a training spin, he applies elec
tricity to their muscles with good effect.

CORINTHIANS WANT
TO WIN BACK THE
PERPETUAL TROPHY
The iQterclub AssociatioQ
Chooses Officers for
- This Season.
Last Sunday moat of the yachts from
Sausalito and Tlburon were to bo seen
in the upper bay. but the wind was so
light that few of them went beyond Par
adise Cove. Anchored in that favorite
spot were the sloops Thetis, Juaaita.
Catherine and Siren of the San Francisco
Yacht Club; the flagship May; the sloops
Queen, Emma, Edna, Truant. Aeolus,
Harpoon, Phoenicia, Clara, Mi3chlef.
Speedwell. Merope, Neptune. Rover and
Sans Soucl; the yawls Arcturus, Seven
Bells and Kittiwake of the Corinthian
Yacht Club, and the flagship Embla, with
a few others of the California fleet. The
boats had a hard time returning to their
moorings with so little breeze as there
was. Some of the Corinthians were towed,
home by a launch.
To-day the sloops Thetis, Catherine.
Juanita, Hope. Surprise, Siren and
Cygnus will cruise to Marln Islands. Pos
sibly the flagship Ramona, the cutter Fol
ly and the sloop Rover may also join the
foregoing. To-morrow the yachtsmen will
land and prepare a clambake on the
larger island. The Corinthians will
cruise to Dillon's Point to-night, return
ing to-morrow. The Enclnals have a
cruise to McNear's Landing on their pro
gramme, while the date Is open on tha
California Club"3 schedule. To-morrow
the south bay yachtsmen will hold a re
gatta for those of the member3 of the
club who are not owners. The Oakland
canoeists -will cruise to Belvedere and
back.
Last Sunday the sloop Cygnus was not
out, she having been taken up on the
ways for repairs. She will probably join
in to-day's cruise. H. R. Simpklns' yawl
Tramontana is at her moorings at Sausa
lito, having been strengthened and gen
erally overhauled.
Secretary K. C. Bartlett of the San
Francisco Tacht Club has received from
Secretary T. I* Miller of the Corinthians
a formal challenge for the Perpetual cup.
Carl Westerfeld and R. H. Morrow's- sloop
Aeolus being named as the Corinthian
champion. The dimensions of the chal
lenger were given as follows: Length over
all. 34.6 feet; length en the water line,
25.79 feet; beam. l'J.S feet; draft. 4.4 feet;
racing length. 2S.30 feet. As the defender
may not exceed the racing length of the
challenger by more than 10 per cent the
champion of the San Franciscos may not
exceed 31.13 feer 1 . The challenge has been
handed to Commodore \V. N. McCarthy
and must be accepted, under penalty of
forfeiting the right to hold the cup. The
contest must take place in not less than
thirty nor more than sixty days after the
issuance of the challenge. There is little
doubt that the San^Franclscos will defend
the trophy witl\ the sloop Gadder, which
won it last year.
The Pacific Interclub Yacht Association
held the first meeting during the present
year on Thursday night at the Merchants'
Exchange, the following being present:
T. F. Tracy, chairman; Commodore E. N,

medieu. members of the regatta commit
tee. A communication was read from th^
Encinals in which the club promised td
continue in the association if the annual
dues do not exceed $10. It was decided to
limit the expenses of the association to
such a sum as may be covered by an as
sessment of $10 from each club? As tu?
hire is the most costly item of expense
it was further decided to issue no invita
tions to the association's annual regatta
and to permit only delegates, representa
tives of the press and the Police Depart
ment and the referee to the judges' tug.
The naval parade committee of the
semi-centennial celebration of the Native
Sons invited representatives of the yacht
clubs to confer with them at the Palace
Hotel last Tuesday night. Commodore H.
D. Hawkes, ex-Commodore T. F. Tracy
and Commodore W. N. McCarthy were
added as auxiliaries to th*e naval parade
committee. On behalf of the yachtsmen
A. M. Clay stated that few if any owners
would be willing to have their yachts
towed round the bay in a night parade or
would, consent to burn colored lights or
let off fireworks from them. The yachts
men, if they receive reasonable induce
ments, will be ready to make their an
nual regatta on September 10 a leading
feature of the aquatic part of the cele
bration.

A double tournament for the ladies of
the club was held on the courts of the
Alameda Tennis Club yesterday. Members
of the Bellevue Club were Invited to play.
Four teams were entered, and when Pro
fessor Dalley, who acted as referee, call

In .the second round Miss Hunter and
Miss Waterman won from Mrs. Waker
ley and Miss Isabel Sherwood, Câ 2. Câ 0.
The members of the losing team did not

into a. farce and culminated In a forfeiture

Brooklyn placed three men on the rubber. In

but when Brooklyn went to bat in the eleventh
they made three tallies before two men were

Solly Smith Disregards Rules and
Loses a Fight.
NEW YORK. June 22.â Joe Bernstein or
this city met Solly Smith of Los Angeles
Cal., at the Broadway Athletic Club and
after fighting fourteen rounds Smith was
disqualified for. fouling. The men were
matched to fight twenty-five rounds at 124
pounds. From the outset Smith seemed
inclined to lose on a foul, in the first he
went down without provcatlon, and Ref
eree Johnny White made him get to his
feet quickly, as his dropping was too
palpable. Several times he dropped to
one knee to avoid punishment, but In the
seventh Smith sent a right hand swing
to Bernstein's Jaw which staggered the
East Sider. In the eleventh round Smith
went down from a straJght left and in the
following round he sent Bernstein to the
lloor with a right-hand swing back of
the ear.
After this Smith was visibly weakened,
but his pluck and gameness were admir
able. He knew he was up against a
losing game and rushed, smashed and
clinched without regard for science or
rules. In the fourteenth round Bernstein
sent Solly down three times with rights
on the jaw. After getting up the third
time Smith butted Bernstein deliberately,
but the referee did not see it. Then after
a clinch Smith hit Bernstein very low on
the body with his right a moment before
the end of the round and the refereo
promptly disqualified the Callfornian for
intentional foul.
Eddie Gardner Wins a Fight.
CHICAGO. June 22.â At the Star Theater

For four rounds the fighting j was en

sixth Gardner fought himself loose and
had the Plflladelphlan going as the bell

His career and character are well told
In the following statement, made yester
day by Orestes Pierce, one of his friends:
"Mr. Pike was a schoolmate of my boy
hood days, when we v.ere at school at
Little Blue, Farmlngton, Mo., for several
years. Leaving that school Mr. Pike went
to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he re
ceived his principal education. Leaving
there he returned to this country and took
a course at Rochester, X. Y., in a business
college and also became an expert teleg
rapher and stenographer and found em
ployment shortly after at Youngstown,
Ohio, in the employ of some railroad.
Subsequent to that he was connected with
the Connecticut Valley Railroad in Con
necticut as train dispatcher, and. follow
ing the fortunes of the general passen
ger agent of that road, he became con
nected with the extension of the Atchlson,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in the
West and thence, step by step, he was
promoted on account of his merit and
ability to the position finally of chief clerk
of the Union Pacific Railroad, with head
quarters at Omaha,
"Here he was first assistant to Mr.
Smith, the greneral manager of the Union
Pacific Railroad, and when Smith left
the Union Pacific to take charge of the
, Denver and Rio Grande Mr. Pike went
along as his chief clerk. At this ltme
he was at the zenith of his career. In
temperate habits and an unforunate mar
riage started him upon a downward ca
reer, which he followed until some four
or five years apo he appeared in Oak
land, where I was then living, an appli
cant for work and in~destltute circum
stances. Knowing his ability and being
informed of his misfortunes I placed him.
In charge of the water works at Hay
wards. This position he was obliged to
fi-ive up by reason of his lack of atten
tion to business and his continued Indul
gence in habits detrimental to good busi
ness. ._
"Since then, from time to time, I have
assisted this man In a charitable way,
getting him employment or furnishing him
with money when he was out of employ
ment, and l^ave faithfully endeavored "in
every way to aid him to recover his lost
position and prestige, all without effect.
In last October he reached the lowest
point in his career and during my illness
Mr. Johnson, my partner, in response to
appeals for aid made to me and which
on account of my sickness were referred
to him. found Pike in a cheap lodging
house in town, sick and destitute, and re
moved him from there to a hospital,
where he was confined some weeks, and
was treated at my expense by Dr. Lamb.
"To be plain, the trouble with Mr. Pike
was his propensity for drink, and upon
my havine to go East in November I
agreed with him that if he would abstain

can be communicated with and asked to
provide for her.
It v.i'.l b e long before the child recovers
from the shock cf the tragedy which has
entered into her life. The secret of her
parentage will probably rest with fcer
dead foster parents, but !t Is probable that
her future will be protected by the Hays,
Â¦who are now in Europe. They have met
â¢with unusual success In the theatrical
business and are well able to care for the
child.
Investigation cf the tragedy yesterday
chews that Mrs. Pike owed her death pri
marily to her own recklessness. She had
relied too much on her ability to cope
Â¦with her insane husband. Knowing of his
threats and of his frequont drink inspired
ugly moods, she had purchased a. revolver
and kept it on a shelf near the door of
her apartment. This revolver, one of
small caliber, was found in the pocket of
Pike, and it is supposed that in the quar
rel, which aroused the house and which
ended in the tragedy, Mrs. Pike seized the
pistol to defer.d" herself and was over
powered by her infuriated ex-husband.
Black f.rper marks on her 'arm tell of her
desperate struggle for life. She had over
matched herself and paid the penalty isi
<2eath.
Her entire life with Pike had been an
ur.fortur.ate, unhappy one. Long before
they were divorced their quarrels, bitter
and frequent, were matters of comment
to their friends. Pike realized that he had
made fatal mistakes in his career and his
lndujger.ee in absinthe inflamed his brain
ur.til his troubles were magnified beyond
their true mear.inp. Even after his di
vorce he harassed and tormented his ex
wife. Ills annoyances became so serious
that he was forced under penalty of
prosecution to sign the following affidavit,
which was found among the effects of the
woman whom he had murdered:

In many respects the life and character
of Pike were remarkable. He was a man
of more than ordinary ability, possessed
a g-ood education and had the faculty of
makir.g friends who remained loyal to
him. notwithstanding his indiscretions.
His marriag-e seemed to rob him of hia
stability and all thought of self-respect.
He became reckless and erratic. He neg
lected his duties and hims^f. He lost po
sition after position snd rapidly drifted
Into the position of becoming' a charge
upon his friends. His inordinate appetite

Reasons for His Reinstatement May
Be the Means of Bringing Other
Black Sheep Back to the
, â¢ Fold.
Major George W. Kirkman of the For
tv-ninth Infantry has been reinstated In
the service, after having been court-mar
tialed and dismissed. The reinstatement
has been done very quietly; not even an
order announcing the fact has been Is
sued, but his restoration -to duty has been
complete, for ho is now under orders to
report to the headquarters of this depart
ment to be ordered to Manila on the first
transport that sails after his arrival. He
is now on his way here and will arrive
within three or four days.
Major Kirkman of the volunteers is a
captain of the Twenty-third Infantry in
the regular service. He sailed away for
Manila on the transport Sherman, which
left here in December last. He had under
his command his battalion of the Forty
ninth, and with him, as a passenger, went
Archbishop Chapelle. When the vessel
arrived Jn\ Manila reports of trouble be
tween the major and the Archbishop were
heard, and the next information that
came from the islands was that Kirk
man had been court-martialed and dis
missed for insulting: the Archbishop. The
insult, according- to the report, consisted
in wantonly interfering with the prelate's
comfort on shipboard.
It is reported now, however, that the
clash between the Archbishop and Kirk
man was not the cause of his dismissal.
It has been reported here that the charges
against him, and upon which he wm con
victed, were intoxication in the streets of
Manila and firing his revolver into the air
while intoxicated.
Kirkman was restored to duty by Con
gress, lie has been restored as a major
of the Twelfth Infantry, his promotion as
a regular officer having come during his
suspension. Why or how this was done
is not known out here, for Kirkman was
not well known among the officers on duty
in this department just now, and his ca
reer as a soldier has not been followed so
closely as the record of his misdemeanors.
Aside from the semblance of complete
pardon, which his reinstatement bears, it
is interesting from the fact that it may
be the precedent by which more than one
volunteer officer, dismissed from the ser
vice, may enter again. Klrkman's sen
tence was approved by General Otis with
out it being forwarded to Washington. In
time of peace every sentence so serious as
the dismissal of an oincer must be sent
to the President for his approval, but in
case of war It need go no higher than the
commanding general In the field. It has
been claimed ili.it a state of war did not
exist in the Philippines when the sentence
was approved, and that, therefore, it
should have been sent on to the President.
It is admitted that the islands were In a
state of insurrection but not of war, and
it Is believed that upon this point Klrk
man's reinstatement is largely based. It
has also been reported that he challenged
four of his court on the ground that they
had prejudged his case, but if that wa3
the reason for his restoration it has no ;
significance other than that Kirkman has
good friends.
Restored to His Former
Rank in Volunteer and
Regular Service.

/â* OUNT CASSINI, Russian Embassador at
( Washington, has notified Secretary Hay that
the Russian Government has granted to a citi

The reason for the notification is that numerous in
quiries have been addressed not only to the embassy
but to Russian consulates by American citizens who
i desire to enter upon mining enterprises in Russian
territory. The Embassador says: "Erroneous views
have arisen in this connection, which it is my duty,

prevention of any misunderstanding, to rectify." ,
With that much by way of prelude the Embassador

It is strange that a disease of this kind should be
increasing among civilized people and hardly known
"among people of a lower grade of culture. We can
'take courage, however, from the fact that when
science by investigation has brought to light statistics
that seem appalling it is not very long before some
thing in the way of a remedy is provided. Civilization
may breed more diseases than barbarism, but it has
the advantage of knowing better how to cure them
and to prevent them. - .
For us there is something almost startling in this
statement: "The greatest increase has occurred in
thf city of San Francisco, where the ratio has crept
up from 16.5 cases in 100,000 population in 1866 to
103.6 cases in 100,000 in 1898. This enormous in
ciease of , more than six times as many in thirty-two
years is deserving of special attention by the people
of that city. "The city of Boston shows the next
most considerable increase, the ratio of cases to .living
persons having almost trebled in the twenty-four
years between 1863 and 1887. After the latter date
there was a temporary decrease, followed by a ten
dency to increase to the presenftime. In the seven
largest American cities, exclusive of Chicago, with a
combined population in 1870 of 8,207.464,' there were
999 deaths from cancer, or 35.4 deaths per 100,000
living persons."
. Figures are cited from the Registrar General's re
port for England and Wales showing that during
thirty-one years there has been an increase from 3S.5
pcisons dying from cancer in 100,000 living popula
tion in 1864 to 75.5 in 1895. A similar increase is
noted in Ireland and Scotland, and investigations in
clir.e to the belief that the condition of affairs is as
AN INCREASE OF CANCER.
ACCORDING to statements in the May number
of "Modern Medicine" there has been in all
civilized countries a notable increase in recent
years in the number of deaths resulting from can
cerous affections. Dr. G. B. Massey is quoted as
srying in a paper published in the American Journal
of Science for February that -after many years' in
attention to the subject the medical profession has of
late awakened to the fact that the disease has become
much more frequent than it was thirty years ago.
It is added that while authorities show the prevalence
of cancer in Europe and in the United States,- they
affirm its rarity or entire absence in Arabia, many
parts of Africa t Iceland, Jamaica, New .Caledonia,
1'ersia and the Faroe Islands.
The next great uproar in this country will be the
sound of boom cities clamoring that the census offi
cials didn't count right.
Along with the increase of exports there has been
an increase of imports, but the increases in that di
rection have been mainly in raw materials brought
into the country to be manufactured. Thus the report
states that raw silk, manufactured fibers, crude rub
ber, hides and skins, pig tin for use in tinplate estab
lishments, cabinet woods and the finer grades "of cot
ton and the coarser grades of wool all show a large
increase as compared with preceding years. The
value of unmanufactured silk imported will be nearly
50 per cent in excess of that of the preceding year,
and more than double that of the fiscal year 1897.
These raw materials hardly come into competition
with home industries. In fact, they supply the means
by which our manufacturers are rapidly advancing to
control the commerce of the world. The figures are
commercial, not political; nevertheless few voters
will read them without perceiving in them another
evidence of the fulnllment^of the prediction of 1896
that McKinley would be the advance agent of pros
perity.
REPORTS from Washington forecasting the
commercial results of the fiscal year which will
end with this month are to the effect that they
will far exceed the results of our trade in any preced
ing year. The total export sTJown to June amount to
$1,286,214,534; and should the June exports keep
pace with those of May the total for the year will
exceed $1,400,000,000, or $173,000,000 greater than
those of the banner year of 1899.
As to the details, the reports go on to say, every
class of goods show augmented exports. Manufac
tured articles will show an increase of more than
Â£75.000,000; products of agriculture will show an
increase of nearly $50,000,000; products of the r:ine,
an increase of nearly $10,000,000; those of the forest
about an equal sum; fisheries are $2,000,000 larger
than last year, and the miscellaneous class shows a
marked increase. Probably the largest increase is in
manufactures of iron and steel, though cotton will
show a considerable increase owing to the marked ad
vance in price.
OUR EXPORT TRADE.
One of the satisfactory features of the prevailing
prosperity is that it is so widespread and so general
that the calamity howler can't find a congenial com
munity in which to pitch his tent and hold forth to a
sympathetic crowd.
In California no chances should be taken. The ef
forts of the party here should be directed to the end
of sending a solid Republican delegation to Congress.
We have now two Republicans in the Senate, and we
should have none but Republicans in the House.
Care should be taken to see that nothing in the way
of mismanagement or unfairness m making nomina
tions, occur to justify factional discontents in any dis
tnct. The chairman of the Republican Congressional
Committee has given the warning and we should
profit by it now, and not wait until the danger is
upon us and the elections at hand.
The loss of the House of Representatives would be
a serious injury not only to the Republican party but
to the country. It is to be borne in mind that of the
term of the present Congress there remains only a
sV.ort session, and that much important legislation is
to he attended to. It. therefore, the lower house
should in the next Congress be under the control of
the opposition it would be impossible for the adminis
tration to obtain the legislation necessary to carry out
fome of the great policies which are required to fur
ther advance thealrcady splendid prosperity of the
; -conic In fact, the loss of the House would be
hardly less hurtful than the loss of the Presidency it
self, and no loyal Republican can contemplate the
probability of such a misfortune without rousing him
sHi to prevent it.
Of course the party can count upon the national
ticket to help the Congressional nominees in every
doubtful district. McKinley and Roosevelt are po
tent names, and many a citizen will vote not only
for Presidential Electors pledged to them, but for
Representatives who will support them in Congress.
I* is, moreover, one of the characteristics of American
politic? that the party victorious in a Presidential
election always suffers from a reaction in the elections
cf the off year, and it is therefore fair to assume the
Republicans will fare better in the Congressional dis
tricts this year than in 1808. Thus there is nothing
discouraging in the iituation; but the fact remains
that the danger point is there.
Some weeks ago Representative Babcock, chairman
of the Republican Congressional Committee, frankly
announced that there is a probability the Democrats
may control the next House, and warned Republi
cans to be on their guard to prevent that disaster.
In the present House the Republican majority is so
small that a loss of very few seats will turn the next
Iiouse over to the Democrats and the Populists. It
will be seen, therefore, that under the circumstances
vigilance will be required from start to finish in
making the fight for Representatives.
ThE DflNGEK POINT IN THE FIGI-jT
N(J\v that the national ticket has been nomi
nated and ratified with an exultant enthusiasm
that assures victory for McKinley and Roose
velt it is time for Republicans to take note of the dan
ger point in the contest before them and make ready
to meet the enemy there. That point is the House oi
Representatives. The Republicans hold it by but 3
sMider majority, and the party cannot afford to take
risks in a single Congressional district.

"Ajnerlcan capitalists "will never be In
duced to put their money into Japanese
manufacturing plants." said Mr. Bomanji,
"for the simple reason that under the
laws of Japan no one but a citizen of
Japan can be a stockholder in or officer
of a corporation formed under the laws
of that country. No American will put
his money Into a business concern where
he can have absolutely nothing to show
for It In the way of stock or bonds;
where his stock must be made out in the
name of a Japanese. I have the pleasure
of knowing Mr. Kondo personally and
have a very high opinion of his ability
as a business man; in fact, I think him
head and shoulders above most of the
business men In the Orient to-day. But
he cannot do business on the proposition
he has to offer American capitalists.
Some time ago I wanted to get hold of
a few shares of Nippon Yusen Kaisha
stock and applied to Mr. Kondo for it.
'My dear Mr. Bomanji,' was his reply,
*I am sorry not to accommodate you. Or
course you can have the stock, If you
comply with tlye conditions. You can
name any Japanese gentleman of your
acquaintance and the stock shall be made
out in his name, but the law does not
permit that it shall be made out in your
name personally.' 'But, Mr. Kondo,' I re
plied, 'I want it In my own name for I
propose to pay for It with my own
money.' He seemed very much put out
and then replied, "You shall have some or
my own stock and I will give you any
sort of a guarantee you please, but I can
not make the stock out in your name.' "
The efforts of R. Kondo, president of
the Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan, to
secure capital in this country to further
the manufacturing industries of Japan,
will not be successful, according to the
views of.S. R. Bomanji, a manufacturer
of Bombay, who recently came here with
a- view to securing closer commercial re
lations between the United States and
India. Mr. Kondo is now in the East
looking over the field.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Whether such recommendations are wise is for
mining experts to decide. There can be no question,
however, of the desirability of a revision of the mining
laws generally, nor upon that of establishing a De
partment of Mines in the National Government. The
industry is one of the largest and most widespread in
the country. There is hardly a State that has not an
important mining interest within its borders, and the
proposed department would therefore be of. value to
every section of the Union. The proposition has been
repeatedly indorsed by mining conventions and merits
the support of Congress.
Mr. Montgomery is quoted as having recommended
the thorough revision of the Federal mining laws, to
the end that mining on the Government domain
should be controlled exclusively by the laws of Con
gress and not left to the regulation of enactments of
statutes by the several States, thus producing a uni
formity of law. He argued also in favor of the aboli
tion by act of Congress of what is generally known as
apex rights, or the right to follow a vein or lead on
it into the land of an adjoining owner; and as a sub
stitute for the apex rights now existing an enlarge
ment of the location, requiring that each claim shall
be circumscribed by the surface lines of said claim
drawn vertically downward.
The wide difference between legitimate mining in
vestments and the stock gambling which has been so
long associated with mining is one that cannot be too
often pointed out nor too strongly emphasized. As
President Montgomery said, the "sentiment that min
ing is more of a gamble than a legitimate business is
detrimental to the industry in general." He might
have added that it is detrimental also to the whole
group of mining States, and materially interferes with
their prosperity. Were the industry rid of the ob
jectionable features which have been associated with
it, and freed from the restrictions of unwise and com
plexiegislation, there would be a marked advance in
the development of the West not only in mining but
in every other direction.
the need of a revision of the laws under which our
mining industries are carried on, and by which they
are frequently impeded. He, moreover, pointed out
that while .there is a widespread belief that mining in
vestments are hardly more than speculative ventures,
the industry when properly carried on is as legitimate
and as safe as any other business enterprise, and
finally he urged that action be taken to procure the
establishment of a Department of Mines and Mining,
under the direction of a Cabinet officer, to the end
that the vast interests involved may have the same
governmental supervision and aid that is given to the
farming interests through the Department of Agricul
ture.
PRESIDENT MONTGOMERY in his address
at the opening of the International Mining
Conference at Milwaukee set forth once more
MINERS AND THEIR INTERESTS.
Now that Roosevelt is on the Republican national
ticket we may expect to hear a sound of Democratic
editors grinding out figures to show how Bryan can
be elected without the aid of New York.

It is against the patriotism of two wars that the
Bryanites will have to make their fight this year.
Many of the best men in the Democratic party re
fused to follow Bryan four years ago, and there is
every prospect that this year the number of such
conservatives will increase. Nor can Bryan hope to
make up for their loss by attracting to his standard
any considerable number of young men. The youth
of the country is not going to turn away from the
splendid examples of patriotic valor, given in the
record? of McKinley and of Roosevelt, to follow a
calamity howler, who in peace has been but an agi
tstor and in war but a charlatan. This is a year of
genuine Americanism, and the victory will be for the
party that is specially identified by its history, by its
principles and by its candidates with prosperity in
peace and valor in war.
The sentiment of admiration for a hero is well nigh
universal among men. and that sentiment will have
irjuch to do in arousing the ardor of Republicans
during the campaign. They will have as leaders two
rren who represent the flaming loyalty of a great peo
ple to the mighty destiny of their country. Under
such leadership there will be an inspiration in the
campaign which will give glow and fervor and
energy to the rank and file, so that there will be a
true enthusiasm at every meetinp^where the members
of the party assemble to confirm one another in their
devotion to the cause of Republicanism.
McKinley's political success has been due to his
statesmanship and not to his military record, and yet
the Republicans who have followed him in upholding
the policy of protection of American industry have
always felt a thrill of pride in the fact that their
leader went to the forefront of battle when the coun
try was in danger and served there with such dis
tinction that though he was hardly more than a boy
in years he rose from the ranks to become major of
a' regiment of brave men. So also while the support
given to Roosevelt is due mainly to the recognition
of his eminent fitness for the duty of presiding over
the Senate, and filling the Presidency itself should
any misfortune deprive the country of the service of
McKinley, all Republicans delight to recall that in
the war with Spain he was no political fiasco colonel
like Bryan, but a veritable heroâ one who at San
juan Hill added to our annals another glorious story
of American valor.
PATRIOTS OF TWO WARS
SPEAKER HENDERSON has .said of the Re
publican nominees, McKinley and Roosevelt,
that they represent "the patriotism of two
wars." The phrase is a good one. The ticket mani
fests that spirit of stalwart Americanism which ani
mates the Republican party and impels it to do honor
to men who in time of war followed the flag with un
flinching loyalty and with a courage that nothing
caji daunt. Many Democrats have been brave and
loyal, but the Democratic party as a whole has never
shown that fervent devotion to Americanism in peace
and in war which is characteristic of the Republican
party. The nominees at Kansas City will not repre- x
sent the patriotism of two wars, nor of any war.
It is to be hoped the information has beerivgiven
early enough to save any American from making a
venture to the gold fields of Siberia this summer.
There is opportunity enough in Alaska for all gold
seekers who are not satisfied with California. In any
event there is nothing whatever for Americans to
hope for in Siberia. Any promise of . exploitation
there can hardly be more than a fraudulent scheme.
The Russian .Embassador has done his duty in put
ting the public on guard, and those who go to the*
Siberian gold fields will have only themselves to
blame if they have nothing but the experience to re
pay them for the venture. .

bearing lands and others is conferred upon Colonel
Vonliarliarsky, I have the honor to beg you to bring
this measure to the notice of the United States au
thorities that are interested, with a view to the avoid
ance of regrettable misunderstandings."

SENSATION IN COURT
Ex-Sheriff. After Being 1 Instructed,
Advanced Threateningly
To-ward Doyle.
John Sedgwlck. freight agent of the
Southern Pacific Company ard an ex-
Sheriff, was instructed in Judge Mpgan's
court yesterday on the charge of assault
to murder for shooting at his assistant,
Thomas R. Doyle. He was represented by
ex-Judge Ferral and Attorney Wilson.
The case was by consent continued til!
July 6.
Sedgwick created a sensation In court
by advancing threateningly toward Doyle
mho complained to the Judge. The Judge
called Sedgwick back and asked him
what he had done. "This man," said
Bedgwick, pointing at Doyle, '*got into my
desk last, right and stole my fix-shooter
out of my drawer. He is a thief and a
liar."
"If you use such language in this court
room again." paid the Judge, "or make
finy demonstration I will adopt means to
suppress you." Sedgwick apologized and
was taken away by his friends. As he was
leaving he punched Attorney Kred Frey
so hard in the ribs that his breath was
taken away. The old man acted as it
be was not quite right in his mind.
It appears that Sergeant Ellis, who
made the arrest, went to Sedgwlck's oflice
Thursday evening and with the consent
of the man in charge opened a drawer in
Pedgwick's desk and secured the revolver
used in the shooting, which he booked
as evidence.

Suit to foreclose a $16,W0 mortgage on

to show cause on the date named. In
stead of issuing a writ in keeping wJth
this theory, however, the writ prepared
by Attorney Collins on the order made
by Judg* Bahrs and which was issued by
the clerk, did not conform with the order,
inasmuch as it actually prohibited the
police from making arrest? and prohib
ited the further hearing of cases by the
Judges of the Police Court.
A motion was made yesterday after
noon before Judge Murasky to dissolve
the writ of prohibition, but the order
made by Judge Bahrs was not interfered
with. The attention of Judge Bahrs was
then called to the state of affairs existing
and he forthwith dissolved the injunction,
stating that good cause having been
Bbown, the writ should be set aside and
vacated.
Immediately following the order va
cating the writ Chief of Police Sullivan
Instructed Ueu tenant Bird sail to call
upon the poolsellers. inform them of tlie
order of court and in addition to make
known to them that if they sold pools
they would be forthwith arrested and
would continue to be arrested so long as
they persisted in violating the law. Chu-f
Sullivan's instructions were carried out
and last night the lamps burned low an<S
<juiet prevailed throughout the gambling
districts of the city.
THE brief respite granted the asso
ciated poolsellers of this city
through the issuance of an alter
nate -writ of prohibition by Judge
Bahrs on Thursday last came to a sud
den conclusion yesterday. Judge Bahrs
peremptorily dissolved the writ and the
powrr of the BpHce to close the gaming
houses is now unrestrained.
The poolFellers secured the risrht, it is
eaM, to continue feathering in the gold of
the unsophisticated through the exercise
of a little brief authority en the part of
George D. Collins, their attorney. Judga
Bahrs said yesterday that the object of
the poolsellers In petitioning fnr a writ
of prohibition was to determine the va
lidity of the ordinance and statute under
which they were belnÂ£ prosecuted. This
petition he signed and ordered the police
to either desist from arresting poolsellers,
or if euch arrests were made, to show
cause on July 2 why thoy had been made.
The issuance of the writ in no wise re-
Ftrained the police from continuing to
make arrests, and inorder to accomplish
the object* of the writ it was essential
that they continue to make such arrests
that the validity of their acts might be
determined on the hearing of the order
Pleadings Prepared by Petitioner's Attorney
Did Not Conform With the Order
Signed by the Court.

Aside and Vacates the Writ
of Prohibition.

Policeman Murphy Thinks It "Was
Matches Ignited byia Bird.
A mysterious blaze broke out last even
ing !n a pile of lumber In Hermann's lum
ber yard at First and Brannan streets.
A still alarm was sent to the nearest en
gine-house, but before the fire apparatus
reached the scene the llarnes had been
extinguished by Police Officer John L..
Murphy with a few buckets of water.
How the fire started is a mystery. A
bird's nest, which contained several
burnt matches, was found In the pile of
lumber and Oflicer Murphy advances the
theory that the bird ignited the luclfers
with its bill, setting fire to the nest. The
blaze then communicated to the lumber,
so Murphy thinks. The damage was
nominal.

Board of Education Finds Attendancs
Not Sufficient for a Grammar
Hating.
The Board of Education has made the
discovery Ihat the Irvingf Scott School has
heretofore been wrongly rated as a gram
mar school In view of the rule adopted by
the last beard. This rule provided that to
be classed as a grammar school required
an enrollment of at least 225 f puplls in the
grammar classes. The reported enroll
ment In the Irving Scott School during
April was only 201 and during May 198.
Superintendent Webster informed the
board that the school was allowed to pre
serve its grammar rating notwithstanding
the insufficient attendance by a special
resolution of the last board, but Chairman
Mark has been unable to find any record
of such proceeding. The present board
.has recently adopted a rule requiring an
enrollment of 2C0 pupils in the grammar
classes to allow a grammar rating in those
schools having primary classes, and un
less the Irving Scott School can secure an
Increase of fifty pupils it will be derated
and become a primary school.

handkrs demanded 53 cents an hour and 60
cents overtime. ThesÂ«Â» demands were ac
ceded to. and now the lumber handlers
have decided to demand an advance. At a
nweting 1 of the union held Thursday night
it v.-as decided that in future the pay of a
lumber handler should bo M a day, with
75 cents an' hour for overtime. The de
mand has been made upon all the lumber
dt-alc-rs and shipowners. Accompanying It
Is" a r-Gii"^ that if the <-xtra dollar a day is
rot forthcoming on Monday there will be
a gen^raf strike along the front. The im
jir- ;:55on is that the men will pet the extra
pay. as thrrc is a great scarcity of labor

s v His Alleged Criminal
Carelessness.
The alarm turned In yesterday at 3:40
a. m. was for a fire In the three-story

SEVERAL CITY FUNDS
HAVE BEEN OVERDRAWN
Reason Why There Is No Money to
Satisfy Demands on St. Mary's
Park Fundi
The statement published in yesterday's
Call that the St. Mary's Park fund has
no existence is substantiated by the fol
lowing figures, showing by how much cer
tain funds have been overdrawn up to
Health department," $24,997 48; election
expenses, $<5S,222 74; stenographers' "fees.
$17 745 70; N miscellaneous court orders,
$1502 17: printing transcripts on appeal.
$1772' maintenance of feeble-minded chil
dren $2150. These, with other mlnT funds,
would bring the total up to $125,000.
The Auditor was compelled to audit
them by mandate, by statute and by de
cisions of the Supreme Court.
The fact that there arc not sufficient
funds to pay the just obligations of the
municipal government shows that the tax
rate of $1,029 levied last year was insuf
ficient to meet all the municipal expenses.
AUDITOR MAY WITHHOLD
MAHONEY'S JUNE SALARY
Commissioner's Neglect to File Hia
Official Bond Properly Leads to
Complications.
There is trouble ahead for Police Com
missioner Mahoney, who neglected to file
his official bond with Auditor We!l3. as
required by the charter. The deputies In
the Auditor's office are locking tip the law
on the subject, and there 1st a strong like
lihood that Mahoney may b3 obliged to
surrender some $400 as salary from Febru
ary 13, the day he assumed office, to Juno
20. when it was discovered that hi3 bond
had not been approved by the Auditor.
The action of the Auditor will depend
upon the legal interpretation of the char
ter provision which sajs that officers of
the city and county, before entering on
the discharge of their official duties,* shall
respectively give and execute to the city
and county such official bonds as may be
required by law, ordinance or the charter.
All bonds excepting those oZ the Mayor
and Auditor must be approved by the
Mayor and Auditor. The bonds of all of
ficers shall be filed and kept in the office
of the Auditor after having been record
ed In the Recorder's office.
Auditor "Welis is of the oplnioÂ« that Ma
honey's bond waa not legal until it was
filed in hia office and after his approval.
Mahoney had the bond approved by tho
Mayor and it was recorded In the Record
er's office on February 13. where it lay
until resurrected on June 3>. Unless the
disputed point is satisfactorily settled the
Auditor may withhold Mahoney's June
salary demand vntil he has paid back the
salary already drawn by him.
The Supervisors' Finance Committee has
directed Expert Williams to investigate
all bonds of city officials, with a view to
determining whether the provisions of the
charter have been complied with.
ment either next Monday or Tuesday. The
usual date for receiving the Oemanrls is
on the 5th of the month, but Mr. Wells be
lieves that as the teachers may desire to
spend their vacation in the country the re
ceipt of their salaries ten days ahead will
not come amiss.

according to Emerson's analysis as "fa
vorites." The law of impartial distribu
tion goes far in the universe, and proba
bly there never yet was a favorite whose
fame had not to undergo a reaction. This
has been emphatically the case with Long
fellow. No one would now attribute to
him the fame, once readily conceded tho
world over, of the most popular among
those who wrote verses in the English
tongue. It is quite certain that no con
temporary English or American poet waa
so widely translated. The list given by his
brother thirty-two translations
Into German, eight into French, five into
Swedish, nine into Italian, four Into
Dutch, three each into Danish. Portuguese
and Polish, and others Into Spanish. Rus
sian, Latin, Hebrew, Marathi. Chinese and
Sanskritâ fifteen in all. All other Ameri
can poets put together did not equal these,
nor had Browning or Tennyson put to
gether quite so many. His writings were
also printed by twenty-two different pub
lishers in London. More conclusive in my
imagination than even these statistics was
a little book of selected poems I once
found in an English lodging-house, in
which more than half the poems icame
from the muse of Longfellow alone.
It is yet too early to award to this poet
his exact proportion of final fame, but the
uniform testimony of all who know him
will admit tbat he possessed something
better than fame In the uniform sweetness
and generosity of his nature. It Is possi
ble that those who disarm criticism dur
ing life by their winning qualities may
gain a little more than their share of con
temporary praise, and may thus prepare
the way for a greater reaction after they
are gone. On the other hand, the men
who call down antagonism often find a
renewed charity after death, that which
was criticised being forgotten and the
qualities hitherto neglected being brought
tragedies of existence in the deaths of hia
two wives. I have in my possession the
minute account by a traveling companion
of the illness and death of his first wife
and of his demeanor under it; and hÂ©
wrote in 1S>77 to the German poet. Freili
grath: "Of what I have been through
during the last six years I dare not ven
ture to write even to you. It is almost too
much for any man to bear and live." In
the ordinary affairs of life he escaped
many trials by leaving criticisms unread;
but his literary prosperity, tried by the
standard of to-day, was never highly
lucrative, the highest positive record ot
income from this source being $2500. an
amount doubtless exceeded by that of
other authors now forgotten, as. for in
stance. Willis. On- the other hand, he had
his full share of the vexations of fame,
being called upon one day. for example,
to write 100 autographs for a fair at Chat
tanooga in behalf of Confederate suffer
ers, about which request ho says: "It was
like fighting the battle over again, but I
did it." It is not infrequent for him to
record In his diary the appearance of four
teen or fifteen callers in an afternoon, or
the arrival o* twenty or more letters. A
lady in Ohio once sent him 100 blank card3
with a request to write his name on each,
to be distributed at a party she wa3 to
?ive on his birthday. Some forty or more
schools in the Western States celebrated*
his seventy-fourth birthday, all writing
him letters and requesting replies. He
sent to each school a stanza, with signa
ture and good wishes. I went once to call
on him on one of these birthday occasions
and saw a pile of sixty or-seventv letters
from a single Western high school. These
things are the reverse of fame's medal
and the things which might make one
envy the solitary freedom of Thorenu.

PITTSBURG, Pa., June 22.â Fire in one
of the principal downtown business blocks
to-day caused a loss of $250,000, involving
eight buildings containing many office
tenants. The aggregate insurance will
more than cover this amount. The fire
broke out in tho rear of the Eichbaum
Company's printing establishment, and
supposedly was .caused by. spontaneous
combustion. The Eichbaum building,
fronting on Fifth avenue, a few doors be
low Wood street, was six stories high and
was tenanted by many officeholders,
among them being Duff's College, occu
pying the upper two floors, and the
Holmes Electric Company on the third
floor.
Before the firemen could do much ef
fective work the fire had communicated
to the Exchange National Bank building,
next door below, and from there to the
Hussey building adjoining. Â« Simultane
ously the fire extended to James -Piatt'a
salcon and restaurant and A. M. Mur
dock's flower store on the upper side. For
a time the entire block bounded by Fifth
avenue. Wood street. Diamond and Mar
ket streets seemed doomed to destruction.
Immense firo brands were carried by the*
wind to buildings in all directions. Tho !
greatest excitement prevailed In the rooms
of Duff's Business College, where fifty or
more students were at work. The exten
sion of the flames was so rapid that these
persons had to run for their lives, not
having time to gather their belongings to
gether. Reports were rife that several
students had perished, but it is known to
night that all escaped unhurt. ?
The Eichbaum building was destroyed
and in the Hussey building the three up
per stories were burned and the lower
floors flooded with water. When the
Eichbaum building had been gutted the
wall of the L portion which ran in baclc
of Plr and Murdock's buildings fell.
crushU, i the rear portions of the Wood
street buildings, occupied by. the Ameri
can Express Company, Paulson Bros., A.
M. Buhl and Jurtz. Langbein & Swartz.
Several firemen were caught in the debris
of this wall, but none were hurt so badly
they could not continue their work.
The principal losses are: The Eichbaum
building, owned: by Whitney, Stephenson
& Co., $75,000; the Hussey building, owned
by Mrs. Emma Alsop. $30,000; Jurtz, Lang
bein & Swartz, artists' supply company,
$8000; Duff's College. $15,000;^ Platt's sa
loon, $5000; Paulson Bros., hatters, $5000:
American Express Company. $5000, -and
Holmes'-Electric Company, $3000. ;
The other losses are distributed among
the office tenants, none of whom suffered
to the extent of more than $2000.

SAN RAFAEL. June 22.â The title to the
Rancho Oorte Madera del Presidio is about
to be attacked, again before the authori
ties at Washington. The most important
part of the land in question is that occu
pied by the present town of Belvedere.
J. S. McCue, who has been In Washing
ton making arrangements for the coming
battle, eaid to-daj r :
"The title to the so-called Reed grant
â¢ will be tested again, and this time we
i have every hope that the early settlers
. will get the land they located as the Gov
! ernment's.
"The last time we lost our case before
I the United States courts on a technical
! Ity and it was dismissed without, preju
! dice, which means that w-e have a right
i to come again. The United States Govern
j ment will this time, through the War De
' partmant, make itself felt.
"The War Department wants the island
'of Belvedere for military purposes. It is
< the intention of the department to get
| possession of the island by having the
I present patent set aside on' the ground
! that it was obtained through fraud; that
! the land, as an island, belongs to the
i Government. This practically means y that
I the Government will fight -the .early loca
tion battle. The Reed grant was for one
square league of land, but through jug
gling it was made into a rubber blanket
I and was made to cover marshes And isl-
I ands and land away beyond the original
boundaries of the grant.
"I have enlisted the services of the Hon.
Richard Doyle and Mr. Bryan of Washing.
! ton to carry on our end of the battle."
It is contended that no Spanish grant
! was ever made to cover marsh land or isl
| ands. Mr. McCue has been busy since hia
I return "getting the signatures of the re
maining original locators to papers and
i affidavits that will authorize action on
! their behalf. Louis Denos, who is now in
! great financial distress, has given McCue
; the necessary papers to present his claim.
Denos, who is now an old man. originally
located the Boyle ranch, in Mill Valley,
as Government land. He was subsequent
1 ly ejected as a squatter. . ,
: Thtre are a great . number of oM lo
; rators in this county who have taken new
! heart in the matter of recovering their
i old homes. They all earnestly hope that
the patent issued against their interests
may be set aside. It. is understood that
the titles to the homes in Belvedere are
Insured by a title insurance oempany, and
so in the event of the Government gaining
possession of the island the householders
will lose nothing. Among the people who
lost their land by the Valentine-Forbes
patent are Judge Edward Gardiner of this
city, Peter Gardiner of Mill Valley, Louis
Denos, Louis Fransun, James S. McCue
end many others who are now scattered
through the county. ,.

DRAKE'S WILD DREAM
OF BOLD HIGHWAYMEN
Vallejo Boatmen's Yarn Accepted as
Truth and Made the Basis for
a Sensational Story.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, June 22.â John Drake, - who
makes daily trips from Vallejo to Benicia
with a party of shipwrights who live in
Vallejo and work in Turner's shipyard at
Benicia, was stopped Wednesday oy three
tramps about two miles from "vail \fo and
forced to give them a' lift. When Drake
returned to Vallejo with his party of pas
sengers he told a wild and exciting tale
of being held up by a band of highway
men.
He reported, it to the police and spread
it about town till it reached the ears of
the overzealcus representative of a San
Francisco paper, who immediately re
ported It to his paper as a most flagrant
piece-of highway robbery, whereas the
facts of tho case show that the man was
not molested any. more than being forced
to give the hobos a ride. Drake is a
drinker and was partly under the influ
ence of Jiquor when he made the trip.

Numerous Professors Drawing Sala-
HAVANA. June 22.â The postal fraudj
have rather swamped the scandal exist
ing in the university, which has been the
milking ground for some of the best
known men in Cuba, who, as under-pro
fespors. received $2400 a year each. There
were seventy-two of these professors ana
twenty-four assistants, some of them hav
ing no classes at all and others only one
or two students. ,Many of the professors
drew other Government salaries.- v
When this was called to General "Wood's
attention he immediately instituted re
forms which resulted in cutting down the
list to forty-six, - including assistants,
which ie enough, considering there aro
only 450 students. For instance, instruc
tion In Greek waa divided into three parts
â history, grammar and literature. It is
now combined under one professor of

ARRANGING FOR
CELEBRATION OF
ADMISSION DAY
An Appeal From the Grand
Marshal to the Fraternal
Organizations.
sThe Finance Committee Considering
Names- -Official Colors Adopted
by the General* Committee.
Beports Presented.
Grand Marshal S. V. Costello has pre
pared the following circular, which will
be sent to all organizations in this city: .
Office of the Grand Marshal.
The semi-centennial anniversary of the ad
mission of California to statehood is rapidly
approaching, and the Order of Native Sons of
the Golden West, as has been Its custom for
tho past thirty years, has taken it upon itself
to see that this event is fittingly celebrated.
With this end in view the- various parlors of
this Order of Native Sons of the CJolden West
have appointed a Joint' 9th of September com
mittee and have perfected arrangements for
the grandest celebration ever held in our his
tory. The parlors of the Native Sons oi the
Golden West throughout the State will partici
pate in the celebration and the parade. #
It is not our desire, however, and the Native
Sons of the Golden West do not claim the right,
to monopolize, the celebration of this great event.
It is our ardent wish that all citizens and resi
dents of the State ot California, both native
and adopted, should unite and co-operate with
us in making the forthcoming celebration of
Admission day the most memorable that Cali
fornia has ever known, a celebration worthy
in every way of such a historical occasion. We
therefore ask the assistance and co-operation
of all organizations, fraternal and otherwise,
in this citj- and State to aid. us in our en
deavor.
It is the earnest endeavor of the Order of
Native Sons of the Golden West, and it should
be the earnest endeavor of every Callfornian.
that the parade should not only eclipse in bril
liancy and splendor all former parades, but
that it should be an exposition of the industrial
and commercial progress of the State during
the half century now drawing to a close and a
demonstration to our guests from sister States
and the world at large of the unlimited ca
pacity, versatility and wealth of the resources
and industries of California.
In addition to a participation in the parade
I would respectfully suggest that each organ
ization arrange some special feature, or float,
that will be symbolical of the purpose and ob
ject of such organization. In this connection
it is earnestly desired that each organization
If possible should adopt and use In the parade
some appropriate costume or uniform, and by
filing a description of the same Immediately
with this office and its publication in the press
of this city a great uniformity in the matter
of uniforms will be avoided.
I would also like to be advised of the esti
mated number of members to act as aids to
the grand marshal, who will thereupon be
appointed by me.
Could I not also ask. in view of the short
ness ot the time intervening between the pres
ent date and September 9, that these matters
b* given immediate and cheerful consideration?
I trust that all the^residents of California,
whether native or adesjited. shall feel it a mat
ter of personal interÂ«it and concern that its
fiftieth birthday is connnemorated tn a manner
that will be worthy of its glorious past and
propheti* of its still more glorious future.
Relying upon your cordial co-operation. Fra
ternally yours, S. V. CO8TKL.LO,
. Grand Marshal.

walked down the heights- of the Corner
Grat above Zerma with a party of young
English girls and their chaperon, wheso
confidence was at once commanded when
I happened to mention that I had been a
pupil of Longfellow; and they crowded
round me with eager questions about his
home and domestic life. This then was
.that fame of which he dreamed when he
wrote to his father at the age of 17: "The
fact is, I most eagerly aspire after future
eminence In literature; my whole soul
burns ardently for it and every earthly
thought centers In it." Yet he always had
that modesty which' Is, as his friend Haw
thorne maintained,' the natural result of
success. He thought much more of the
laurels of others than of his own, and we
meet in his journals the most delightfully
tranquil expressions of serenity; as under
the attacks of Foe, for Instance, the
author of which undoubtedly imagined
him as writing in torture. Unfortunately
his friends were not always equally placid
in his behalf, and Lowell in particular was
fond oi picking up the fallen arrows of
criticism from Margaret Fuller's quiver,
for instance, and sending them back, a lit
tle sharpened, as if with Longfellow's
compliments.
The truth is that both Lo'ngfellow's
books and his personality belong to that
class whose members should be designated
Into perhaps undue prominence. Few
things help an author mare In the direc
tion of posthumous fame than to require
personal vindication. This has been strik
ingly visible irr the cases of Byron and
Shelley- in England, as also with Poo and
Whitman in America. Lowell plaintively
points oat. however, in his "Fable for
Critics" that a man is certainly made no
worse by the fact that his friends love
him. Longfellow's characteristics cer-.
tairtly did not weaken him. for he showed
invariable independence of character anti
wrote anti-slavery poems of his own mor
tion which reached an audience more con
servative than those of Whittier or Low
ell. Reference to the Harvard College
manuscripts shows him. moreover, as
sometimes placing himself quite in oppo
sition to prevalent opinion of the faculty
and yet holding his own. In dealing with
the students he was distinctly a pioneer,
although his pioneership took the form
of a courtesy and suavity of manner then
less prevalent than now; the tradition be
ing that he was the first professor who
addressed the young men as "Mister," a
practice which now generally prevails. I
can testify that during an abortive rebel
lion in 1841, when a mob of students was
assembled in the college yard and had re
fused to listen to any other Instructor,
even requesting one of the older profes
sors to "go home ani po to bed. old Dosy
Prosy," the leaders turned with respect
to Longfellow when he appeared and said:
"We'll hear Professor Longfellow. He
always treats us like pentlemen." Thl3
is not the kind of deference won by a
weak man. but by one who meets his stu
dents on higher ground than that of mere
authority.
Lonprfellow's life, though seemingly
prosperous, was not free from the deeper

NEW YORK, June 22.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Easy money
and , the absence of any large material for
speculation have tended to limit the declines
which the stock market naturally exhibited on
bad crop advices and the alarming develop
ments in China. The market has had a re
actionary appearance, but the selling of stocks
has been largely if not mainly by bear traders,
although some long stock was forced out,
especially In the grangers. Berlin, too, con
tributed toward the concessions by selling
through London considerable amounts of its
holdings of American stocks and the financial
and speculative complications at Berlin have
been regarded with attention here aa an argu
ment in favor of conservatism and caution.
The somewhat Improved aspect of the finan
cial situation In Germany toward the end of
the week wan therefore a favorable sign and
it has also been noted that the London money
market, though sensitive to the Influences of
the troubles In the Far East and the financial
pressure on the Continent, has not been the
scene of any disturbance. The fact that New
York has supplied Paris and Berlin with nearly
$10,000,1*00 .of gold in the last few weeks with
out It having any effect on rates for money
at New York Is a notable fact and a decided
demonstration of the strength of our financial
position. In fact it Is thought that the recent
gold movement has been flue largely to loans
made in New York for Berlin interests and
it is also pointed out that the steady increase
In the average of bank loans at New York
Indicates that considerable money Is again be
ing Invested In foreign bills, which is equiva
lent to discounting European time obligations
with American capital. /

CHICAGO. June 22.â The speculators had to
swallow long wheat In .heavy chunks throuen
out.the session and at times July dipped by
yesterday's closing figures. The Northwest
spring wheat condition wna^tlll the great bull
stronghold and dtapenned nnws of such a pes
simistic nature that the offerings were handled
again and again instead of a loss In price
being made. Trade was active, not to say ex

NEW YOHK, June 22.â Bradetreefs to-mor
row will *ay: Midsummer dullness In â¢dis
tributive trade and industry and further re
duction of prices of, manufactured goods, par
ticularly iron and steol and raw textiles, but
a markfd upward movement In nearly all agri
cultural product?, are the leading features of
the business situation this week. Wheat has
advanced 14c iÂ»er bushel since June 1 and 20c
from the low point reached in Novemberâ a
unln over the latter period of 27 per cent In
price. Corn crop advices nre still In. a high
degree encouraging, but that cereal has sym
pathized with wheat, as have also oats, and
nog products havo in turn felt the quickening
Influence of hicher prices for corn. Improved
demand for daily products Is reflected In slight
advances this week. Crop damage has been
a moving cause for the advance In the price
of cotton. Home weaknesn has been noted In
cotton good?, without, however, favorably af
fecting distribution. Trade- In dry goods has
been helped by warmer weather. Wool Is
lower and woolen goods market is rather quiet,
awaiting the next 1/ondon wool â¢ sales and the
openinn of the spring weight -season. I
Weakriess of prices Is" still the leading feature
of the Iron trade and lower Â¦ quotations are
noted for pig Iron. Structural material has
also verified predictions in , a decline of from
$7 to $9 per ton. Domestic orders for Iron are
perhaps slightly more numerous, but- arc for
small quantities. Talk of a systematic shut
down of Iron furnaces producing for the open
market comes chiefly from the South, but while
this subject i3 under consideration the disease
Is finding a partial cure in the going. out of
blast of a number of less economical furnaces
PEACHESâ Peeled. 15<?I20c; unpc-eled, S<g9e.
There was a somewhat better feeling in the
market for evaporated apples to-day. Receipts
were rather small. This factor, together with
better advices from - the country, served to
give a firm undertone to . the market. At the
close, however, prices wore unchanged, but
tending upward. California dried fruits were

Government deposits, which have been called
to the extent of J5,000,000. The estimates of the
week's cash changes indicate a gain by the
banks of considerably over a million. The pay
ments which the banks had to make to the sub
treasury for the gold bars exported were prac
tically offset by the payments of that Institu
tion to the market. The currency movement
at the interior has continued largely In favor
of New York. The rate for call money at the
stock exchange Is not an accurate Index of
money conditions, as the large borrowing de
mand for stocks for delivery by the short in
terest cerves to keep down the rate for call
loans.
Part of the selling of stocks is undoubtedly
for the purpose of realizing funds to divert y>
wheat and cotton speculation. The decline Tn

ment of the expected exports of gold to-mor- |

CLOSING
The bank sold Â£40,000 gold in German coin
and lost Â£40,000 for an unstated destination
and Â£60,000 to the Continent. From Egypt
Â£50,C00 was received. During the week Â£687,000
German coin has been nold.
The markets have been generally stagnant
to-day in the absence of news and owing to
the holiday to-morrow. The Americans were
firm until New York opened, when they re
lapsed, closing at the lowest In the street on
persistent American selling. Copper shares
were firm, though the metal was dull. Dis
counts were firmer and call "money steady.
Loans for over the month were firm.
NEW YORK. June 22.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
London Market.
Failures for the week have been 179 In the
United States nenlnt-t 17* for last year, and 23
in Canada against IS last year.
At the three chief markets wool has been ex
tremely dull, with sales of only 2,720.600 pounds.
Even where considerable blocks are offered at
low figures the conditions of the goods mar
ket is by no means encouraging to buyers.
Lower prire.i are again reported for several
grades of cotton goods and are expected for
others, and buying is thereby retarded. Heavy
brown ifocds and drills and denims are dull
and without doubt the uncertainty of the ma
terial market had some Influence. The price
of raw cottons has again advanced Uc during
the past week but without cl>>ar Indications of
increased demand for the supply remaining or
insufficiency of that supply. In woolen goods
the manufacturers also find that the demand
falls to answer expectations or to sur?ort
prices acked at the opening, and some large
works are now rer>orted running part time or
closing.
The shipments of boots and shoes, only 233,
743 crsc-s. In three weeks of June, are over 20
per cent smaller than in 1S39 or 1835, and .small
er by 10 per cent or more in other years. The
Jobbers still appear inclined to wait, and some
manufacturers decline quotations recently
named and have closed or reduced force. Of
necessity the beet economy in production can
not be reached under such conditions. Hides
at Chicago are not changed for the week, as
reported gains and losses balance.
The belief Is that so large a part of the
srjrin" wheat has been killed as to reduce a
yield expected to be close to the largest on
record as to considerably less than the world
has required during the crop year now ending.
Until within the past three years it would have
been ro.isoned that any material .idvancj In
prices would neutralize the foreign conditions,
which had caused exports of about 1SO,OOO.(X}O
bushels of wheat, flour included, In the clos
ing year after 222,000,000 bushels In the previous
ytar and 217,000,000 bushels in the year of 189S,
besides exports of 213,000.000 -bushels of corn lit
the closing year against 177,000,000 last year and
212,000,000 In the previous year. But the facts
seem tc Indicate a more extensive and lasting
Jncrpasf of foreign demand than has been con
sidered ricbable. Other sources of heavy ex
port have been found disappointing. The
United States continues to show enormous
po\vÂ«r of Increase, if supported by prices,
which, until recent years, would hardly have
been regarded remarkably high. If the coming
crop falls much below expectations the de
n.and for it may prove surprising, even chough
prices average more than have been expected,
lion and steel progress toward that end as
mado when the structural producers a wealt
ato reduced the prices of beams to Jl 90 and
angles to $1 80 at Plttsburg, leaving only rails
ani tin plates which have not been reduced
from the highest point. The rail works are
crowded far ahead, and the question in plates
depends largely upon wages. Western bar Is
reduced to $1 55 and steel bars to $1 50 at Pitts
burg, with a general shutting down of works
expected July 1. Hoops are quoted lower at
12 25 and No. 27 black sheets at 3c, buyers ask
ing orjy for Email lots. There Is a wide range
of quotations for merchant steel, and the lower
prices named for pipe have only started the
demand a little, as buyers expect yet lower
quotations. Minor metals are also quiet, with
small transactions.
NEW YORK, June 22.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
The damage to the wheat crop of the North
west Is the event of chief importance. How ex
tensive the loss may prove. In view of ths
widely contlicting accounts, can only be Judged
from the speculative markets, in which Infor
mation gathered at the West haÂ« caused a re
rtiarkable advance at Chicago, 15c In ten days,
and the price here has advanced lie per bushel,
though for the September option only 9c.

We are In arrears this week for supDllee, al
though the colliery owners on the coast are,
struggling to get an Increased quantity for
ward. They are handicapped partially for want
of carriers, but principally because they are
unable to supply the pressing demand for tha
Alaska trade. As this la alrpady commencing
to subside, deliveries here should shortly be
coming forward more freely. I; our oil prod
uct had not Increased for the cast twelve
months, to aid our large consumers of fuel for
steam producing, manufacturers would. In . a
number of instances, have been obliged to close
down indefinitely, or at best run on hair tim<;.
In fact, the Â«iemand for crude ofl ia not beir.K 1
adequately satisfied. As might be anticipated
the product from a large number of wells has
been far from realized. Coal teenage from Aus
tralia and English ports Is difficult to secure,
as the demand for tonnage everywhere cannot
be filled, and the advance In the cost o* coal
will not permit paying asking freights. The
present flurry in wheat will upset all calcula
tions; It must disturb the local freight market
outwards, and will force grain carriers to setk
other ii'-'rts for business."

COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL NEWS
grave as it may ultimately prove to be, had.
been discounted, was prevalent among many
traders. The heavy profit-taking did not tena
to change this opinion. In other words it wai
held by many that the price had advanced
sufficiently to allow to-day's news, which was
the most unfavorable yet received, I to be Ig
nored. Hot weather and a clear sky were
generally reported from the Dakotas, Minne
sota and Manitoba, Their crop possibilities
were generally reported two-thirds ruined ana
the condition called a veritable disaster. Stat
istician Snow of the Board of Trade, Just back
from a thorough investigation of. the situation.
Is reported to have declared the two Dakotas
would not raise over 40,000,000 bushels, while
other authorities said the three Northwestern
States, together with Manitoba, would not pro
duce over 60,000,000 bushels this season. July
opened lttc to l%c over yesterday at 83%c to
8"%c, and shortly afterward sold at 82tfc.
The opening bulge was under tho ' influence of
news of the character hereinbefore mentioned
and the slump was on profit-taking by longs. Â¦
The Northwest was still a buyer, but follow
ing the opening the- market fluctuated accord
ing as the pressure from longs was heavy or
merely easy. July, following this dip, rallied
to S3%@83Hc, whereupon longn went after more
profits and sent It back to 8IVic. Again there
was a rally, July this time" touching S3V4c and
moat of it was held.- The market was pressed
back to 82%c, but firmly resisted and closed
%c over yesterday at S3V&C. The Modern Mil
ler reported harvesting of winter wheat pro
gressing favorably.
Corn was strong the greater part of the
session. The close was strong at an advance
of **,j?%c over yesterday at 41V4@41%c.
The oats- market was strong and active. July
gained over yesterday, closing at 24%c.
Provisions were active and strong. The pit
seemed to have at last contracted the bull
fever which has been affecting grains. Hog
receipts were light, prices at the yards firm
and there Â¦was a broadening of the outside de
mand. July pork closed 50c over yesterday,
lard 23c up and ribs 22V4c improved.

A heavy business Is doing: In refined sugar
and the manufacturers are oversoldr" A good
margin of profit exists In this trade. Reports
from the boot and shoe Industry are of rather
unsatisfactory trade prospects and leather and

the formation of separate unions. Among
the tradesmen who will organize within
the next few weeks are the tailors, soda

Visit of a London Banker to This
City Gives Rise to
Rumors.
A. Hoffnung, a banker and capitalist of
London, who has been at the Palace Hotel
for several days, was former Hawaiian
Minister to the Court of St. James during
the reign of the late King Kalakaua. He
came here from the East, It is said, with
a proposition from an English syndicate,
to buy up the crown land claims of ex-
Queen Liliuokalani, which are still pend
ing at Washington.
This proposed syndicate deal is the re
sult of a close study of the dethroned
Queen's claims and a belief that her de
mands are just and will meet with the
approval of the Government.
Mr. Hoffnung has never visited the isl
ands, but was appointed to the position
of Minister by Kalakaua on the occasion
of his late Majesty's first visit to Lon
don more than twenty years ago. He
assisted materially in floating the first
Hawaiian loan In London, a part of which
has been assumed by this Government
since annexation. Yesterday Mr. Hoff
nung left for New York and will soon sail

REV. DAVID WIRT AT

known among his friends as "Sam," was
on trial yesterday before Justice of the
Peace Kerrigan, and judging from the
bills submitted In evidence the defendant
and those whom he entertained must have
literally bathed In champagne.
The total amount of Indebtedness In
curred by Hicks, according to the state
ment rendered, was $219 50, of which near
ly $200 was for the sparkling beverage
consumed by Hicks and his merry party
at a half-dozen meals. Hicks was credited
with paying $160 on account, and he fur
ther contended that there was an over
charge of $40. On that showing he owes
but $19 50, but hla attorney quoted the
statute which permits of a judgment of
$5 only and costs on an unpaid liquor bill,
and Judge Kerrigan will so decide.

In the case of Frederick Erratt vs. C. F.
Humphreys, an action to recover a bal
ance of wages as master of the schooner
Mildred E on a voyage from San Fran
cisco to Alaska, United States District
Judge de Haven decided yesterday that
the defendant should pay the" costs.
The libelant began the suit In forma
pauperi? and he was thereupon allowed
to prosecute the action without prepay
ment of fees or costs or giving security
therefor. The action was settled out of
court without the knowledge or consent
of the proctor for the libelant. No pro
vision was made In the settlement for the
payment of costs.
In his opinion Judge de Haven said:
"The defendant knew that the action
was commenced without the prepayment
of fees and costs and without giving se
curity therefor, and such costs ought to
have been provided for In the settlement.
To hold otherwise and permit the pay
ment of costs incurred by a litigant "suing,
as Jn this case, in forma pauperis, to be
evaded by an 'outdoor settlement' would
be unjust to the clerk, marshal and proc
tor of the libelant. and would, in the lar.
gua^e of Judge Cox, "encourage practices
which the court should be slow to sanc
tion.' Judgment will be entered against
the defendant for costs."

Delegates to Labor Council Engaged
, in Straightening Out Tangles in
Conflicting Issues.
The allegations made by the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association, In
which the attention of the San Francisco
Labor Council was directed to the Impor
tation and sale of Oregon convict-made
stoves by J. Noonan.& Co., at 1017 Mis
sion street, -has led to a peck of trouble.
The communication received from the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion had for its object the co-operation
of the Labor Council in stopping the Im
portation and sale of those stoves in this
city. In reply to the allegation, Noonan,
in a communication to the Labor Council,
sets forth the claim that there are others
engaged in the same business, who have
not been mentioned. The Iron Molders'
Union No. 164 has taken a hand in the
investigation and has appointed a confer
ence committee consisting of Charles
Bagly, Jerry Powers and Steve Gulrn,
with full power to act with the executive
committee of the Labor Council In ferret
ing out the darky in the woodpile. '
The communication from the street-car
strikers in St. Louis was courteously re
ceived and the subject-matter was re
ferred to the law and legislative commit
tee. A reply will be forwarded conveying
the sympathy of the San Francisco labor
unions.
The friction existing between the ship
Joiners and the house carpenters over
work on vessels at the front occupied
much of the time of the council. It was
conceded that the ship joiners should
have prior labor rights along the front as
against the auxiliary workmen who had
been pressed into ship work at a time
when Joiners could not handle all that
was to be done during war time.
The carpenters rather liked the ship
work, as they got better pay, and as a
consequence they hold out with a tenacity
not admired by the legitimate ship join
ers, who as a matter of course are Justly
jealous of any intrusion from other than
their own union hands. Â¦
The further consideration of a boycott
against Thomas McGee's horseshoeing
shop, at 300 Gough street, for his obsti
nacy in refusing to unionize, was referred
to the executive committee.

DENTAL CONVENTION'S
LABORS ARE ENDED
OAKLAND, June 22.â "Tour Honor, I
will refrain from taking a drink of
Intoxicating liquor for six weeks or
failing will jump overboardâ so help
me God."
Such was the oath which Charles M.
Burke took to-day In the Police Court
when he was allowed probationary free
dom until August 2 upon the order of Po
lice Judge Smith.
Burkes case was out of the ordinary
run of Police Court cases. He had been
arrested for cruelty to his children, a
daughter being complainant. Burke had
been a hard drinker, and in his cups he
brutally abused his family. A few days
ago he went home drunk and despite the
serious illness from scarlet fever of one
of his children he treated them inhu
manly. The police were called to remove
the- arunken parent. The complaining
daughter protested that she did not desire
that her father should be sent to prison,
but she pleaded for Some corrective meas
ures. Burke in his sober senses appeared
very contrite. He avowed earnestly his
affection for his children, and when his
probationary discharge was suggested the
unhappy father with apparent sincerity
recorded the startling oath before the
court. He insisted vehemently that he
would keep his pledge and he was given
the opportunity to reform.
Graham was then transferred to another
regiment and recciv^-d orders to make
ready for transportation to the Philip
jiinÂ«*s. Bidding hip young bride dry her
tears and remain fa'.thful to him he prom
ised to return as quickly as he was mus
tered out and could make the voyage
home. For a time frequent letters passed
between them, but gradually the soldier
husband became careless of his wife's
tender missives and finally stopped writ
ing altogether.
When Graham's regiment returned he
failed to viFlt his wife or communicate
with her. and hip indifference induced the
c'5'rted woman to commence proceedings
for a leg-al separation.
.Attracted by Graham's natty uniform
end jaunty Ftyle, th*Â» young woman ac
cepted p. proposal of marriage after a
month's acquaintance with her brass-but
toned charmer. They were married in
Sfir. Francisco and for a week enjoyed life
Together at the home of the bride's par
ents.
The coypi^ 'met about two years ago at
Camp Barrett, where in that 'city of white
VntF. Graham was encamped as a soldier
f-f the E:j?hth California Volunteers. The
vpung woman who is now Mrs. Graham
and sorry 'that ehe is resided with her
parent* at Haywards. She was a fro
quet v!=itcr to the soldiers' camp and was
admired by many.

Channel Cut Through a Bend Trans
fers a Large Tract of Nebraska
Into South Dakota. , Â» .
JACKSON, Nebr., June 22.â An armed
band of thirty-two men from South Da^
kota has cut a channel through Rinin
ger's Neck, or, as it Is known on the
maps, Bruighers Bend, in the Missouri
River. There is great excitement here.
The bend is some twenty-five miles
around and not more than a quarter of
a mile across its neck. This neck is low
land,, covered with willows and small
timber. At one time probably the channel
of the river ran across it. Residents of
the bottoms along the river east of Elk
Point have always contended that If a
channel could be cut through the neck
and the river straightened it would pre
vent the recurrence of the spring floods,
which have so frequently overflowed the
southwestern portions of Union County.
Another result of cutting through the
neck of the bend Is to throw thousanas
of acres of excellent farming land which
has been a part of Nebraska into South
Dakota.

the death of a hero at the Bald
win Hotel fire praise of his name
was on every lip. and a generous
eentlment of reETet that such a man had
paid for his heroism with his life stirred
all hearts. He was described as a capital
ist, unmarried and with relatives in the
East. It was not known that he had been
granted a decree of divorce in 1S84 by
Judge Hunt, nor was It known that at the
time of the flre his wife. Ignorant of the
fact that any such decree had been entered,
was then in Dawson City earning her own
living and wondering what had become of
her husband.
Ah Kinc wa.x warned, but as he did not
understand English he continued to be
impolite and was arrested. The case came
l-ffore Judjrp Fritz yesterday and an in
terpreter was called into requisition. Ah
Sine: produced his license, lmaeinin-f that
he had been arrested for peddling with
out a license, but the Interpreter explained
to him what the Mayor objected to and hÂ«
promised to be good in future. The Judge
continued the case for ten days, and if
Ah Sinf? acts up to the reform movement
the caÂ«se will then be dismissed.
Mayor Phelan ha* instituted a reXorm
among p<^ddlers in the shape of politeness,
which was demonstrated In a case in
Ji. .>-â¢Â¦ Kriti's court yesterday.
Ah Sine, a Chinese peddler of fans, was
accused of disturbing the peace. He was
pfKldling his fans In front of the Palace
HotÂ«M Thursday night, and when a likely
purchaser approached he would shake a
fan in hi? or her face. This was resented
and complaint was made to the Mayor,
who happened to drop around. He In
structed the ofneer on the beat to warn
the Chinese not to be so impolite as to
thrust the fan in a person's lace, and if
he did not desist to arrest him for dis
turbing the peace.

Then It will be necessary to learn his
wishes concerning the date of the recep

some days after his arrival, for he will
naturally be tired from continuous travel.

Progress vras made yesterday by the

arrar.ping the details for the reception to
Archbishop Riordan. The Metropolitan
Temple was selected upon recommenda
tion bv the committee on hall as the place
for thÂ« public 5peaJcing. The events will
be three in number, as exclusively pub
lished in The Callâ the reception at the
Metropolitan Temple, the rellsio 11 ** cere

vate reception $-iven by the Catholic
clergy to the Archbishop.
The conclusion was re-ached by tho sub
cotT.mittee that the exercises in the Met
zv>pol>tan Temple should be free to all
comerrs, and that cards of invitation would
rot bo required. It was recommended
That the ofter of the League of the Cross

should be accepted. Other details were
not completed.
An rdcress of welcome will be delivered
by Â¦ prominent Catholic, who has not yet

date for either event. Archbishop Rior
dan has written since he left Rome con
cerning his movements. It is supposed
that he Â¦will sail from Liveri>ool on the
Oceanic on June 27, accompanied by his
secretary, and that he will reach New
York about the 1st or 2d of July. He will
stop a few days in Chicago and will then

THE PLAINTIFF AND THE MAN TO WHOM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS MARRIED
Inner suit Mrs. White prays only that
the decree of divorce entered in October
of 1884 be set aside as fraudulent and
false. The divorce was granted on the
ground of desertion. It was alleged that
the defendant, "disregarding her marriage
vows and obligations, did, on the 8th day
of June, A. D., 1883, willfully, Intention
ally and without cause or provocation, or
any cause or provocation, desert the
plaintiff," and had, ever since the date
named, "continued to desert the plaintiff,
and to live separate and apart" from him.
His letters to her at that, time are filled
with pleadings that she remain away from
him, and promises that he would Join her
as- soon as he could. There is a record
that summons had been published, and
there -is al6o an affidavit among the
papers, in which Charles Koleman swears
that he personally served upon Mrs.
White, the defendant in the divorce suit,
â¢a -copy of- the divorce complaint and a
summons to appear in court and defend
.the, action. This, he swore, was done in
New York City. Mrs. White declares she
was never summoned/ nor did she know
of the suit until after her husband s death
and when Judge Pierce wrote to her while
she was in Dawnon. â¢ â¢
The decree of divorce was granted on
the ground of desertion, the default of the
defendant having been ; entered, and all
those years, and at the times when she
saw him on. her brief visits out here, Mrs.
White declares White never told her of
thd decree and never let her know any
thing about the suit. And none of his
people ever told of it,' but she says she
does not think. they knew any more about
the decree than she did.
There are quite a number of defendants
to the suit just filed, and these represent
the relatives of White. Just before he
died' he invested $50,000 in an annuity, and
it is the opinion of the attorneys that this
cannot be recovered, but there is a good
J100.000 left, and Mrs. -White ls seeking to
secure her widow's share. The divorce
must first bo set aside, and- then when
that has been done she will seek in the
probate court to have one-half of the
property distributed to her.
Why White secured the divorce is what
his wife cannot explain. He was always
well spoken in his letters to her, and they
never quarreled. She has numbers of let
ters, dated before and after the decree,
which are filled with pleadingsto her to
remain away, and she cannot understand
his desire for. a divorce.
He did come East once, a few years be
fore he died; after having sold his busi
ness, but he had another excuse for not
remaining with his wife.. She declares ho
said then that he was interested in a big
mining deal and that he would have to
travel through the States for a while be
fore he could settle down; but that then
he would come to her and they would live
together. At that time the divorce decree
had been entered in Judge Hunt's court
over ten years.

DESPONDENT- WOMAN
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children listened
to a strange tale yesterday from the lips
of a little woman of about twenty-flve
years living at the Rosedale House, 313
Ellis, street.- He was called to the prem
ises by a report that Mrs. Mary Palmer's
little boy had been abused by older boys
on the street. While in conversation with
him the woman stated that she was born
in the Alps and came to this country
when she was a child, Of her family sh*
was not well informed, but from â¢ hex
earliest recollections she said she bore
the marks of a hot Iron on her side and
arm. In other words she had, when an
infant, been branded. She said the mark
on her left' side was in the shape of a
figure 1 8 and that j on her left arm was a
Masonic emblem.- .
Mrs. Palmer told the officer that when
she lived in New York she met a woman
named .Mrs. Kruse.- who v endeavored -to
remove the marks of the iron by the
means of acids and the matter became
known to the Oeary Society. Mrs. Palmer
states that she has no idea 'what she was
branded for unless her parents took that
Snowy Alps.

Angered , at some uncomplimentary re
marks she believed had been made about
her by Mrs. C. Reddy of South San Fran
cisco, her former friend. Miss Frances
Lee, , who 'lives at Clay and Leavenworth
streets, slapped Mrs. iteddy^s face yester
day afternoon.
After- landing on her alleged traducer
the infuriated woman drew a toy pistol
and threatened to fill Mrs. Reddy with
lead.
The assault occurred near . the - corner
of ' Powell and Eddy streets, and several
citizens who witnessed the assault, think
ing Miss Lee was about to shoot the ob
ject of her wrath, seized her. Police offi
cers Mulcahey and McLean appeared at
this Juncture and took the woman into
custody. At the City Prison she was
charged with battery. Several hours
later she was released on cash bail, fur
nished by "Judge" Curtis. ,
Mrs. Reddy says she received a tele
phone message yesterday forenoon from
Warren Tyson, a messenger at the City
and County Hospital, asking her to meet
him at the entrance to St. Ann's building
on Eddy street, near Powell. Thinking
that he wanted to see her on a matter of
importance, she went to the appointed
place and -was surprised to find Miss Lee
there. Without a word of warning Miss
Lee smote her on the cheek and as Mrs.
Reddy screamed for help her assailant
thrust thÂ© toy pistol, which was fully un
loaded, into her face, at the same time
declaring she was about to make her a
subject lor the Coroner.
"Both Tyson and Miss Lee have been
saying uncomplimentary things about
me," remarked Mrs. Reddy at police head
quarters. "Several nights ago Miss Lee
and Tyson came to my house, and as the
woman was intoxicated I refused to adr
mit them. Since, then they have given
utterance to some ugly remarks concern-
Ing me, and I informed my husband.
"When 1 received the telephone mes
sage from Tyson I concluded that he
wanted to apologize, so I went to meet
him. I am sorry I did, as my husband
will be very angry at me when he learns
of the disgraceful affair. Tyson was evi
dently aware that Miss Lee Intended to
assault me. I suppose he thinks it ls a
very funny joke to see a woman beaten
by another on a public street. He was
not man enough to keop his appointment
with me, but remained in the shadow of
another building while this woman was
abusing me and threatening to riddle me
with bullets."
Miss Lee, while admitting the assault,
claimed that she was Justified, as Mrs.
Reddy had spoken disrespectfully of. her.
She -will be given a chance to air her
grievances in the Police Court to-day.

When White died he was worth some
thing over 1100,000, and his widow wrote
to' Judge Pierce, one of .the attorneys in
the present suit. . asking him to arrange
whatever formalities .were necessary in
regard to the share she thought was hers.
Judge Pierce took up the case and found
fiirt that the will made no provision for
her; that White declared he was unmar
ried and childless. and had provided. for
any possible wife that might appear to
claim his- money. Then, looking further,
fierce found the record Â¦ of â¢ the divorce
granted in 1884.
Ho notified Mrs. White. at once, and she
started from Dawson a few days before last
Christmas. She came out on the ice and
had a Journey, full of hardships and perils,
a i riving here last April. .Work on the
raptors in the suit was at once com
menced and yesterday it was filed.
-In 1&Â£6 she started to come to San Fran
cisco, but on her way out here she heard
of the Klondike excitement, and being a
woman of decision she changed her course
and went up into the gold fields. ' For a
good many of the years she had spent in
New York she had supported herself by
keeping a boarding-house, and she went
Into the same business in Dawson and
made money. She was in Dawson when
she heard of her husband's death.
Â¦ Vp to a short time .before his death In
1S&; White and his wife carried on this
kind of a correspondence, and half a dozen
times during those years she came out
here, sometimes for a few days, some
times for a few -weeks, but always White
urged her to return and not endanger him
by her presence. In her complaint the
wife says she learned after years of ex
perience that his promises were valueless,
but she could do nothing but complywlth
his requests that she remain East, and so
she stayed away from him.
wanted was to get away. Â¦ â¢ '
Mrs. White did go East. She met. her
husband's mother and stayed with her for
some time, and then, with money that
White sent her, she crossed the sea and
visited Ireland, where she was born and
where she had relatives. She came back
to New York before the year was up,
however, and when she wrote to White
and told him he sent word back that she
had done wrong.
Then in the spring of 1SS4 she came to
Ran Francisco, but she did not stay long.
White told her he had not been able to
break loose from his old companions. He
was goinc to do so, and if she remained
out here it would make it all the harder
for him. He had prospered and was well
off. but he said he would be sure to Sell
'the business before another year had
pafced, and then he surely would Join her
In NÂ«;w York.
fihe again went back East, and waited,
but ptiil White had nothing more than
rroir's'es to offer. He wrote frequently,
HX'd r.o did she, but his letters were of
lironvfe onlyâ that h.e would .soon be able
to dispose of his business and then lie
would come Kast to her.

The etory reads like a romance. It is
told in a complaint filed In the Superior
Court yesterday by W. L. Pierce and E.
F. Preston, Mrs. White's attorneys. In
the complaint it is alleged that the for
tune White left to his relatives was based
upon money loaned to him by the woman
he cast from him before they were mar
ried in 1SP3, and his will, filed Just after
his death, shows that he attempted to cut
her out of any of his property by provid
ing $50 for any wife or widow who might
--prove her claim.
The plaintiff in the present action was
a Mrs Jennie Tosney when she met White
In this city in the early '80"s. She had
some property in New York, left her by
her husband but a short time dead, and
White was a struggling clerk in the em
ploy of the old dry goods firm of Curtin &
Co. He wooed and won the little widow
from New York, and she . promised him
that as soon as she could dispose of her
property in New York she -would- let him
have what money she could, and he prom
ised that when she gave him" the money ;
he would marry her.' Â¦
She sold her property and gave him $17,
000,' and then; on -May SO,- 18S3,-sho-and
White were married.
For two weeks they lived happily to
gether, and then Mrs. White discovered
that her husband was not leading the life
of a conscientious married. man. She up
braided him for Ms manner of living, and
he told her he had become so entangled'
with certain women that he could not
break off his connections with them; he
said he feared they would raise a scandal
If he should refuse to consort with them
any more. And then he made this propo
sition: She was to go East to her rela
tives and his, r.nd .for a year she was to
travel in the Kast. in Irelandâ anywhere
she pleased. In fact, only she was to re
main away from this coast. By the end
of the year he would have sold his busi
ness in San Francisco and he would then
Join her. and together they would begin
life anew in New- York. He told her he
was sick of his life in San Francisco Rnd
he was sick of San Francisco, and all -he
