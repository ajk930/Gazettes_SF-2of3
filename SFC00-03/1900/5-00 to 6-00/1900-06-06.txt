Victoria, surrounded by the Duke

Christian, Princess Victoria and
many other notables of her court,
drank to the health of Ix>rd Roberts and
the army at Balmoral last evening. A
bonfire, lighted at her Majesty's com
mand, blazed on Craiggown Mountain, il
luminating the country for miles around.
The nation joins in the toast, glorifying
Lord Roberts and turbuiently rejoicing in
his. victory.
The dispatches of Lord Roberts, telling
of the Incidents before the surrendering
of the capital by three civilians, stand
alone, as the correspondents with him
have not had their turn with the wires.
Lord Roberts' postscript announcing the
loss of the Yeomanry battalion came too
late for the public to know it last evening.
The newspaper commentators consider
tho Incident deplorable, but as having no
â¢weight to speak of in the results. The
battalion numbered between 400 and 500.
General Botha and most of hia men got
away from Pretoria. This is inferred from
Lord Roberts' message, but the presump

cannot escape the British dispositions
without a fight.

North China Gazstte states that the Empress Dowager ordered the For

powers rather than interfere with the "Boxers." Naval representatives
of the po-xers are said to have asked permission of their Governments
to blockade the Peiho River as well as Tientsin.
Germany regards the situation as ominous and dreads an encounter
between the "Boxers'' and Russian troops. It is believed in Berlin that
the powers may exsreise joint control as they did in Crete, and the pow
ers are said to be exchanging dispatches with a view to the selection
of a commander for the combined fleets. Peking is believed to be men
aced by "Boxers'' and reports continue of their damage to property and
of tb.e uselessness and desertings of the Chinese troops on the rail-way.
The Situation Is Alarming.

No actual Indictment was found, how
ever, though the .conduct of the office
was gone Into with great attention to de
tails, and the last session of the Grand
Jury this afternoon was a very stormy
one over this very point.
The Grand Jury began an investigation
of Jthe office of Countx Assessor Dalton
some weeks ago. paying special attention
to the manner of the collection of personal
property taxes and the retention by the
Assessor of fees for the collection of poll
taxes A civil suit covering this latter
point was ordered by the Supervisors yes
terday, so that this was disposed of out
side of the Grand Jury-
The County Assessor at once opened
upon the Grand Jury and accused that
boJy of attempting to Injure him and of
"doing politics" against him. The Grand
Jury replied by summoninr Mr. Dalton
and all of his deputies and their examina
tion occupied several days. The principal
point under investigation was the collec
tion of personal property taxes, but the
Inquiry went into the withholding of fees
for the preparation of the Oakland city
assessment roll and the Assessor's report
of labor upon that work, his withholding
of fees for the collection of poll taxesand
alleged failure to collect poll taxes. The
law covering the collection of personal
property taxes makes the Assessor liable
upon his bond for all uncollected taxes
of this variety. It was found that M:%
Dalton's accounts exactly balanced and
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, June 5.
*jn? SENSATION was created this af
f/\ ternoon by the report that County
II Henry P. Dalton had
been indicted by the Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury concluded its labors this
afternoon and attempted to make its re
port, but Judge Greene refused to accept
it on the technical ground that R. M.
\, entworth, one of the Grand Jury men,
was absent, Holding- that the fall jury
must be present when the report was
filed. He ordered the Grand Jury to be
present Thursday, when it will file its re
port and receive its discharge.
Scarcely had the Grand Jury been dis
missed temporarily than it was reported
that its investigation of the County
Assessor's office had resulted in an in
dictment against Assessor Dalton. In a
very few moments the report spread in
every direction. It was well known that
the Grand Jury had paid no little atten
tion to the office of the County Assessor.
"There has been some talk that I have
been dilatory in the collection of personal
property taxes. The only thing I can say
in relation to this charge is that I have
done my full duty. My deputies have
been instructed to overlook nothing, and
if there have been any difficulties In this
matter, it has been because of *hÂ»<T In
ability to gather the money."
"I have heard rumors during the day
to the effect that I am to be in
dicted by the Grand Jury. Whether
there Is any truth in these rumors I
am unable to say, but I can truth
fully assert that they cause me ab
solutely no worry- If the Grand Jury re
turns an indictment against me it will
be at the instigation of my political ene
mies, who are attempting at this time to
do everything that tends to my defeat for
the office of Congressman from this dis
trict. While I have not conversed with
any member of the Grand Jury, I have
been led to believe by my friends that
there have been no findings against me by
that body. In fact. I am at a loss to
know on what charge I could be held ac
countable to the law. My administration
as Assessor has been free from scandal,
and my force of deputies I consider as
honorable, and reliable as any body of
men that "could be brought together la
any public office.
County Assessor Dalton denies the In
dictment story^ and also charges politics
as the basis oT the Grand Jury's move.
Mr. Dalton said this evening:
That the Grand Jury has gone into
these affairs very closely was well known,
and this caused the excitement that fol
lowed the announcement that Mr. Daltoti
had" been Indicted. This was added to by
the fact that County Clerk Frank C. Jor
dan, who is Intimately connected with
Mr. Dalton's campaign for Congress and
Is doing the active work of a campaign
manager, said that an indictment had
been found by the Grand Jury against
Dalton. and with the same breath de
nounced it as a political scheme to Injure
Dalton. As Mr. Joraan 13 so intimately
connected with Mr. Dalton's campaign
and as he was called as one of the last
witnesses before the Grand Jury to-day,
color was given to his first statement.
that there was no personal property roil
except what had been collected. An in
vestigation into this phase cf the mat
ter brought the charge that the original
property roll had been destroyed and thst
the roll as it existed had been made to fit

the mere fact of selling eatables in a sa
loon did not constitute it a legitimate
restaurant, and further declared that the
saloons mentioned must close their side
entrances or go out of business.
Charles Kapp, representing the saloon
known as Kapp & Street's, was informed
that the Commissioners had visited his
place and were dissatisfied with It and Its
six entrances. The board gave him one
week in which to close several of his
doors and ordered him "to conduct a more
orderly place in the future on penalty of
being refused the much-coveted license.
Regarding the pension list the commis
sion decided that all policemen who are
receiving pensions for disability must be
examined by a board of physicians and
where the disability is not apparent a call

With a number of State dejegations thr
color question has been made an issue.
The Iowa delegation was the first to meet
this morning- and to put its protest on
paper. This afternoon the Utah delega
tion called on Mrs/ Ruflin in a body and
offered their support. Mrs. Ruffin said to
day that notwithstanding she was namel
as a delegate from two white organiza
tionsâthe New England Press Association
and Massachusetts State .Federation â she
would not present her credentials from
these organizations.- She will enter as a
delegate of the New Era Club of Boston
or not at all. In the meantime she is
occupying a seat with the Massachusetts
delegation, but has no vote.
The formal opening this morning was
most impressiveâ 20tw women tilling the
auditorium, the boxes and the two bal
conies and even standing room being at
a premium in the rear. The hall was
artistically decorated.
The chief feature of the session was
Mrs. Lowe's address.
This address was preceded by words of
welcome from Davis S. Rose, Mayor of
Milwaukee; Mrs. James Sidney Peck, on
behalf of the women's clubs of Milwaukee,
and Mrs. Arthur Xevilte, for the Wiscon
sin Federation. The response was by the
vice president, Mr?. Sarah Platt Decker,
who was given an ovation.
After Mrs. Lowe's address came greet
ings from other national organizations, in
cluding a telegram from Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt of New York, president of
the National Suffrage Association.
At the afternoon session came a series
of reports. Mrs. George H. Noyes of Mil
waukee, chairman of the credentials com
mittee, reported on the number of dele
gates that had registered up to noon to
day. This included 6S4 delegates and 197
alternates, including about 100 officers and
members of committees who were entitled
to a vote. So far Illlonls has the largest
delegation, numbering 110 members. The
committee on rules and regulations, Mrs.
Lucia Blount of Washington, chairman,
reported that delegates would be allowed
one speech on a motion and that thÂ«
speech should not exceed three minutes.
This was amended to read five minutes
only when the question of reorganization
came up.
To-night the Alhambra Theater was
thronged with a fashionable audience, be
fore which Mrs. Hamlln Garland lectured
on the possibilities of sculpture.
Succumbing to the pressure brought to
bear from delegates all over the country,
Mrs. Lowe announced about midnight to
the representative of the Associated Press
that she had consented, contrary to her
expectation when she came to the conven
tion, to allow her name to be used as a
candidate for the presidency.
MILWAUKEE, June s.â The opening of
the fifth biennial convention #f the Gen
eral Federation of Women's Clubs to-day
was most animated. Mrs. Lowe delivered
her biennial address at the morning ses
sion. The Massachusetts delegation held
an indignation meeting during the day at
which a committee of two was appointed
to carry out the wishes of this delegation
to support the colored delegate, Mrs. Jose
phine Ruffin. The committee presented a
resolution of protest to the board of di
rectors in which they asked that the col
ored delegate be restored to her rights In
the convention, urging that In a great or
ganization such as the national federa
tion there should be no distinction on ac
count of color. Only three members of
the board spoke in favor of retaining the
colored delegate. They were Mrs. Sarah
Platt Decker of Denver, Airs. Charles
Morris of Berlin, Wis., and Mrs. James
Windsor of Dcs Moines. la. The other
members of the board were either opposed
outright or remained silent. It is prob
able that the board will consider the mat

The platform denounces the Republican

and corruption, for the "scandals of its

boMism around the White House," and
declares that administrative reform Is
necessary In every department of the
General Government.

when Senator Mackey, chairman of the
committee on electors and delegates, en

without a. dissenting vote.
"As the committee on platform is not

in the convention can stand â the Chicago

The man was Edward S. Gates of Essex,
and his action immediately set the conven

however, that the Chicago platform ad

out with cries, hisses and cheers, until

mittee over ten contesting delegations
from St. Louis and three from Kansas
City blocked the deliberations of the Mis
souri State Democratic Convention,
which met here to-day to name a full
State ticket. In both instances it is a
contest between police machine and .anti

Conservative Democrats are now at
tempting- to bring the two factions to
pether by a resolution commending the
administration in general terms and ex
cluding any personal or specific references
whatever. If this is not acceptable there
will probably be a bolt as neither side
j will permit the success of the other. The
I convention will reconvene at 10 a. m.
Idaho County holds the pivotal vote.
The anti-administration delegates at first
only held out for no resolutions at all
touching State affairs, but declared if any
commendation was attemptwd they would
try to denounce the Coeur d'Alene admin
istration.
The credentials committee will favor the
seating of the^anti-Steunenberg delegation
from shoshon'e, but Steunenberg hopes to
def.-at the report in convention, although
his defeat on the temporary organization
makes this look doubtful.
LEWISTOX, Idaho. June 3.â The State
Democratic Convention to elect delegates
to the national convention met this after
noon with John Hailey, State chairman,
presiding. There were 628 delegates rep
resented, about one hundred and twenty
being present exclusive of the contesting
Shoshone delegation of 12 each. For tem
porary chairman the Steunenberg forces
nominated K. M. Wolfe of Klmore and
the opposition H. C. Jackson of Ada. The
vote -resulted in 114 for each and the chair
man declined to decide. On the second
ballot the Siounenlierg men lost three
votes and Jackson was elected. This gave
the appointment of the credentials and
other committees to the opposition. A re
cess was then taken which v. - as subse
quently made an adjournment until to

To-night the Repub!!ean County Com
laittee, A!fr*Â»d Bcuvier chairman, will
meet at Shiels Hall to consider plans of
district organization. Some meetings of
the exÂ«Â«<;utive committee have been held
recently ar.d therefore a simple plan of
sstai'liFhing district clubs may be submit
ted. The rocent activity of railroad and
EaJoon parasites leads to the suspicion
that the lower element-? of the party may
ittempt to embarrass the committee in
the work of prganization. Before the en-
Euinj? campaign fairly opens !t will be
made clear to the her.chmen of Herrtn,
and the low-hrowcd hangers on at Crim
minR- saloon, that the decent Republicans
of the city will not take ordeTS from the
Southern Pacific or its political agents.

appointed by "Bogus Telegram" Lynch.
Johnny Mackenzie and J. Alva Watt. The
lav,- provides that the delegates shall be
chosen at a primary election. It is proper,
therefore, that the work of district or
ganization should be carefully scrutinized.
Special care should be tuken at* the out
set to eliminate the creatures of corrup
tion. The corrupt boss never goes into a
campaign as an open candidate or an
avowed aspirant for office. He sneaks
under cover during the battle, and comes
out at the close of the conflict to claim
the truits cf victory.
The attention of Republicans should now
be directed to the work of uncovering the
railroad and saloon henchmen before they
succeed in getting the slightest hold on
the party organization. The clean, decent,
law-atiaing citizens of San Francisco,
who stand for the principles of the Re
publican party, can easily expel the crea
tures of the boss from the conventions of
the party if they will exercise common
vigilance and a fair degree of interest in
local affairs.
Twenty Senators to be chosen next No
vember will vote In the Legislature a lit
tle more than two years hence for a Sena
tor of the United States to succeed George
C. Perkins. Every Republican aspirant
for the office ought to proclaim his candi
dacv before the State Senators are chosen.
If Herrin has a candidate for United
States Senator let his favorite be put in
the field so that the voters may not be
deceived. It is fresh in the minds of the
people that the railroad put forward a
candidate In the last Legislature who
could not carry a single Senatorial dis
trict In the State. The Republican State
organization was betrayed into the sup
port of the railroad's candidate. The
scheme to defraud the people and degrade
the party would have triumphed If The
Call nad not battled resolutely to save the
State from shame. The conspirators
themselves acknowledged t^at this Jour
nal wrought their defeat. There should
not i)e a recurrence of the Senatorial
strife. Candidates for the Legislature
should be compelled to declare their pref
erence in advance. : r rv :
There Is one important duty that every
good citizen should bear in mind. The
law requires a re-reglstratfon throughout
the State for the general election next No
vember. Every citizen must register anew
In order to vote for President, Vice Presi
dent and candidates for Congress and the
State Legislature. In order to dispel all
doubt Republicans should register anew
at least one month before the primary
election of August 14. Citizens who have
changed their residence since the last elec
tion will not be entitled to vote at the
primary unless re-registered. Since all
must register anew for the November
election the duty should be performed at
once. Then the question of the right to
vote at the primary election cannot be
raised to vex the elector. No one can tell
at this time what a narrow-minded little
partisan Mayor might attempt to do with
the Election Commission. To /be on the
safe side Republicans should register
without delay.
The Democratic County Committee will
meet as a convention in Native S^ns' Hall
this evening to elect 154 delegates to re-p
resent the Democrats of San Francisco in
the State Convention which- will assemble
at Sacramento Thursday of next week.

put on Mission Rock and on Angel Island
isjone that has been claiming a great deal
of attention from the committee on de
tention camps and the question is still
unsettled. It will take a great manv men
to do patrol duty on land and there
should be an effective quarantine from
tne water. There was an intention to call
upon the militia for this duty, but the
Beard of Health cannot pet the militia
without the permission and the order of
the Governor, and so it v.'lll have to await
his pleasure, for it is. conceded that the
militia could do the work cheaper than a
special detail of police, and the question
of expense is one that vitally interests
thf> merchants.
The Federal quarantine service will
have exclusive control of Mission Rock,
when it has been inhabited, and there will
be more surgeons needed to care for the
Chinese there, so It Is probable that the
Government service here will be materi
ally strengthened.
The ministers have also come to the
front on the quarantine question. At a
meeting of a committee representing the
Ministerial Unions of the city and ap
pointed for the purpose of investigating
the quarantine it was decided that a com
mittee of fifteen, representing all denom
inations, should be appointed to approach
the State Board of Health and demand
that a competent- Investigation of affairs
in Chinatown be made. Dr. Henry A.
Fiske, Rev. E. B. Pond, Rev. Robert
Whitaker. Dr. L. J. Wikoff, Dr. Atter
bury and Captain Thomas of the Salva
tion Army were appointed to form the nu
cleus of the. committee.
Owing to the stoppage of the Sacra

Each alternate car of the Jackson-street !
line, and any additional cars that may be/
necessary to accommodate the travel, wilt'
run through to Golden Gate Park, via
Central avenue, Sacramento street and

The work of the Citizens' Relief Com

the canvassing committees will be heard,
and it ia expected that they will be able

a. communication from the Board of i
Health of San Francisco was read, glv- I.
ing an account' of the bubonic plague in !

was adopted. , . ,â¢
Health Officer Nichols reported that he
and his assistants made daily inspections
of Chinatown and the Japanese quarters,
and he believed that with the quarantine
in San Francisco and the close watch kept
here that there was little danger of an
outbreak of the plague in this city.

. Pettigrew ir.sistt-d on replying. Said he:
"I made Ihe statement that a contribu

Cramp to the Rrpubllc*:i National Coxa

Har.r.a continued !n denunciation of
P'ttigrew's cours?, saying that he some
tirms doubted ih<- parity of the man "in
putting such rot as he does in the Record
and expecting people to believe It."
When the cr.ti-trust bill was laid before
the Senate. Pettlgrtw of South Dakota
moved to proceed with its consideration.
GaHir.p^r cf New Hampshire moved to
refer the matter to the Committee on Ju
diciary. In ihe course of a speech en the
subject Bacon uttered the words that
Etartfd the turmoil. Instantly Hanna
was en his feet.
Bacon of Georgia precipitated the scene
by repeating a charge made several days
ago by Pettigrcor that Cramp, the Phila
delphia Fhip builder, had contributed $450.
000 to the RepuHican campaign fund In
1S32 with the un<!<-rs*tan<U:igr that he would
be reimbursed by contracts for the con
struction of warshlpi for the Government.
The charge. Bacon said, had neither bÂ«er,
denied by Hanna. the pres-nt chairman of
the Kepubllcan Xatior.al Commit lee, nor
by Carter, who was chairman of the com
mittee ia 1SS1
Then the Ftorm broke. Hanna vigorous
ly denied any knowledge of such a trans
action and expressed his opinion that it
Â¦was false. Car.fr declaied the statement

that Senator had substantially verified
the Etory. He abo attacked Hanua rela

replied in kind and expressed doubt of the
South Dakosan's sanity. He was followed
by Carter, who denounced the charges as
figments of Pettigrrw'p imagination.

WASHINGTON, June 5.â The House nn
assembling to-day adopted the. conference
report on th,e Alaskan code bill. The re
port showed a complete agreement. A
conference was. ordered on the Neely ex
tradition bil! and then the differences be
tween the two houses on the military
academy appropriation bill were consid
ered, an hour beirg given each side for
debate.
Hull of Iowa said the most important
amendment to the bill v.ns that increasing
the rank of the senior major general and
the adjutant general cf the army.
Driggs cf New York criticized severely
the proposition to raise General Mlle3 to
the rank of lieutenant general, saying to
promote General Miles to the exalted rank
of Grant. Sherman and Sheridan would be
little less than an outrage. So far as Ad
jutant GeneraL Corbin was concerned, he
called attention to the marvelous "rapid
ity of General Corbin's promotion since
1S0C, when he was a lieutenant colonel."
Cummings of New York regretted that
his colleagues had opposed the promotion
of General Corbin.
"1 will support this amendment." said
he. "because both these oHicers were vol
unteer officers who rose from the rank of
private soldiers." (Applause.) -
Bryan's letter.
Later Cummings created something 61 a
sensation by reading the following letter
from \V. J. Bryan:
"LINCOLN, Nebr.. June 5.â My Dear
Mr. Cummings: I see that the Republi
cans are asserting that I think a. constitu
tional amendment necessary for the an
nihilation of the trusts.
"I have never said or believed that an
amendment "was necessary. I have urged
legislation which I believe to be constitu
tional. I have said that I favor a con
stitutional amendment if the decision of
the United States Supreme Court declare
such legislation unconstitutional. The
Republican party does not want to destroy
the trusts. During this session of Con
gress the Republicans have unanimously
supported a proposition to give the na
tional banks control of the currency and
thus create a paper money trust. I in
close a copy of my Chicago ar.ti-trusi
speech, which discusses the question of
constitutional amendment. Yours truly,
\ "W. J. BRYAN."
The Demrtcrats cheered vociferously
when Cummlngs concluded the reading.
Cushman of Washington had a sharp
exchange with Cummings over the letter.
"The trouble with Mr. Bryan," he said,
"is that he is for the Supreme Court when
it decides his way and against it when it
decides against him."
Clayton of New York favored the propo
sitions to promote Miles and Corbin. He
was followed by Lentz of Ohio, who made
an onslaught upon the proposition to pro
mote General Corbin and who severely
arraigned the Republican members cf the
Military Affairs Committee for declining
to take action looking to the adoption of
a Senate resolution to print lO.OOo copies
of the Coeur d'Alene investigation. It was,
he said, another step in the direction of
militaiism.
Lentz Assaults Corbin.
Lacy of Iowa asked Lentz about the
politics of the Governor of Idaho and
jeered him until he finally admitted that
he called himself a Democrat. But. he
said, every Democrat on the Military
Committee had signed a report condemn
ing Governor Steunenberg and President
McKinley for blacklisting organized labor.
Lentz then directed his assaults against
General Corbin. who. he said, had been
hanging about the corridors of the Capitol
begging for promotion.
"I have not any more respect for mili
tary beggars than I have for political beg
gars," said he. "I believe that military
men should fight for their promotions, not
beg for them. '
The excitement had been rising during
his remarks, and things were at a high
tension when Hull rose to reply.
Hull denied that the adjutant general
had haunted the corridors or asked mem
bers of Congress for promotion.
Lentzâ Is it not a fact that he appointed
sons of members and indirectly got their
influence in that way? /
Hull â He has appointed a good many
staff officers. The gentleman from Ohio
is evidently anxious to get the fact before
the country that I have a son in the army
who has served in the staff department at
Manila. That is something I am very
proud of. He enlisted first with his own
regiment, having served in the National
Guard for ten years, and got a commis
sion by the votes of his own comrades
for the rank ot captain (applause on Re
publican side), and he was promoted and
is now a major on the staff in the Philip
pines. (Renewed applause on the Repub
lican side.) His regiment Is coming home,
and both myself and his good mother have
tried at the War Department for the last
five months to get him ordered home, so
that he could resume the avocations of
peace, and the testimony from several of
the generals who have reported. General
Wheeler among the others, is that his
work there was so good, he was so ef
ficient in discharging the duties of his of
fice, that they did not want to retire him.
but further to advance him. Mr. Chair
man, I thank God I have sons who can
serve their country. (Applause.) I am
proud of them. I thank God I am not

Hullâ I wouW if it had any connection
! with this matter. *
Lentsâ Is bÂ« not sucking the public

j side.)

! himself a distinguished officer during 1 the
< civil war. said that in the estimation oj

Brown of Ohio assailed Lentz. He wou.d
I like, he said, tc see some one. or soine
! thing- that would commend the patriotism
i of that â¢ centleman. If Lentz were fa
r miliar with the history of his own state
: he v.oukl know that H. C. Corbln had
; fought for his promotion.
All the minor amendments were first
! non-concurred in. The motion of Hull to
! non-concur in the Miles amendment pre-
I vallfd without division.
After another spirited debate the Cor
bir. amendment was non-concurred In. as
Â¦was the amendment relative to cadets at
Suizer of New York then moved to
Instruct the conferees to insist upon their
disagreement to these three amendments.
The motion was lostâ b4 to l'J3. A direct

| Miles amendment was les: by ayes ana
noes â n2 to 142. A direct vote to instruct
! against the Corbin amendment was also
j lostâ fit) to 107.
The bill then went to conference.
The conferees on the naval appropria
' tlon bill reported a further disagreement
upon the items relating to armor plate,
ocean and lake surveys and the abolition.
of the sea course for naval cadets.
Tate of Georgia demanded a sepa
! rate vote on the armor plate amendment.
j He moved to recede and concur in tha
Senate amendment.
The motion was lostâ 92 to 147. The bill
was then sent further to conference, tha
House insisting 1 on its disagreement.
The conference report on the general
! deficiency billâ a partial reportâ was
I agreed to and the biil was sent back to
conference after concurring in the amenrt-
I ment Riving: the employes of tho House
and Senate an extra month's pay by a
vote of 126 to 62. -^ -Â¦Â¦- Â¦
At 6 o'clock the House took a reces3
! until S p. m.
When the House reassembled at 8
i o'clock the rules were suspended and the
| Senate Joint resolution authorizing the
I President to restore George W. Klrkman
1 to the army as a captain was passed: also
! Mils for the relief of Colonel Charles B.
! Doupherty and other members of theÂ»
I Ninth Pennsylvania Infantry; authorizing:
! the President to appoint David Bagley,
â¢ brother of Ensign Worth Bagley. killed at
Cardenas, as an extra cadet at Annapolis;
to extend a patent to Seth H. Smith: to>
authorize the President to retire Andrew
Geddes, Twenty-fifth United States Infan
try, as captain and to grant an Ameri
can registry to the ships Star of Califor
nia and Star of Bengal.
There Â¦was quite a flurry when Hay of
Virginia attempted to file the views of the
minority of the Military Affairs Commit
tee on the Coeur d'Alene investigation.
The chair stated that he had directed that
certain portions of the report containing
testimony and the arguments of attorneys
be not printed.
Hay protested vehemently- against this
action, but the chair was firm and carried
his point.
During the night session the conrerence
report on the bill to provide for Govern
ment depositories in our new possessions
and ratifying the agreement with the
Indians on the Fort Hall (Idaho) reserva
tion bill were adopted.
A special bill to provide salaries for cer
tain officers in Alaska was passed.
Dalzell. from the Committee on Rule3.
| offered a special order setting aside De
cember 6 for the consideration of the
Grout oleomargarine bill.
Grout of Vermont, the author of the bill,
said he advised the friends of the bill to
accept the proposition, though not alto
gether satisfactory.
Tawrey of Minnesota used strong words
I In his characterization of the conspiracy
j of the oleomargarine manufacturers to de
feat the Grout bill.
The rule was agreed to without division.
The conference report on the extradition
bill was adopted and at 11:20 p. m. Hull
presented the conference report on thÂ»
military academy bill. It was a complete
agreement, the House receding from the
Senate amendments for the promotion of
General Miles and General Corbln and
making a compromise provision relative
to West Point cadets, increasing the num
ber by two from each State at large and
ten from the country at large, or a total
increase of 100. The conference was
adopted. 123 to 91.

came into the stretch head and head.
Then for a few strides the black mare's
head showed in front. At the last six

and O'Connor drew his whip on the mare.
She responded gamely, but at the weights
Jean proved the better and he rushed
across the line a neck In front, while the
crowd cheered them both to the echo. At
no time during the entire journey were
they more than a half-length apart.

John J. Greeley Has an Unpleasant
Experience With Carbon Mon
oxide in the Hall.
John J. Greeley, assistant warrant clerk,
was nearly made a subject for the Cor
oner yesterday through the defective gas
fittings in the City Hall. One of the war
rant clerks has to be on duty all- night,
and for his comfort there is a bed In the
room off Judge Mogan's courtroom.
Greeley retired about midnight an.fl left
the gas burning low. About 7 o'clock yes
terday morning Bailiff Coghlan of Judge
Mogan's court went into the room and at
once detected a strong smell of gas es
caping from one of the jets. He roused
Greeley with difficulty and it was some
hours before he fully recovered. If the
window not been open a little he
would have been suffocated.
It is supposed that owing to water hav.
Ing been in the gas pipes the light had
been extinguished, leaving the jet open.
It was not the first time the lights had
popped out because of water In the pipes,
and the warrant clerks asked the Board
of Public Works to supply them with
electric lights Instead of gas,- but the
change has not yet been made.

FORTY-EIGHT DOG STAKE
FOR INGLESIDE PARK
ROW IN THE LUBECK
RESIDENCE EXPLAINED
Charges of Battery Against Jacoi.
Green and Adolph Lubecl: Are
Dismissed.
The domestic troubles of the Lubeclc
family, at TÂ»24 Golden Gate avenue, wers
aired In Judge Cabaniss' court 3 - esterday,
and they were rot edifying. Jacob Green,
Morris Lubeck's brother-in-law, and
Adolph, his eldest son, were charged with
battery upon the old man last Thursday
night. Lubeck was represented by Attor
ney Monteith and Green and Adolph Lu
beck by Attorney Rosenthal.
Lubeck testified that Green came to his
house and suggested that owing to th<* un
happy domestic relations between him and
his wife they should get a quiet divorce.
Lubfck agreed to this, providing he got
the pawnshop on Sixth street, and then
Green struck him on the head with a can?.
knocking him down. Then Adolph took,
the car.e and struck him with it, and his
wife came out with another cane and also>
beat him. lie had suffered mentally an.l
physically since. To show a motive he
said that he had informed the Federal
Government some years ago that Green
and his three brothers were smuggling
diamonds into the country. For that rea
son there was a conspiracy tv> kill him.
On cross-examination Lubeck denied
that he was in the habit of beating hi a
wife. She called him names last Thurs
day morning, and his second' son. Oscar.
Interfered and he slapped his face. Ha
denied that he tried to strangle the boy.
Green testified that Lubeck attempted to
strike him with a cane, and he struck him
in the face In self-defense and broke thtÂ»
cane. He denied that he was ever accused
of smuggling, or that he had ever dono
such a thing. He had for years helped to
support Lubeck's family, because Lubeclc
was too lazy tf> work for them. The last
named was constantly abusing his wtfe.
Adolph Lubeck corroborated his unclo
and denied striking his father. He sepa
rated hts father and uncle, that was all.
Dr. A. S. TuchW testififl that Lubeclc
was suffering from an Inflamed eye duo
to the blow about an inch and a half be
low the optic, and there was only onÂ©
chance In a hundred that the injury would
be permanent.
The Judge dismissal both cases. Consid
erable timf WH wasted bv Attorney Mon.
teith Insisting upon the Judsro taking th<j
evidence merely to show whether thu nvira
serious crime "of mayhem should not b*Â»
charged. He <llri not want the defendants
to get the benefit of "once in jeopardy."
The Judge ruled asrainst him.
Lubeck has instituted a $..0,000 ?uit for
damages against Green and his son.
fornlan has made him favorite at odds of
10 to 6. Some bettors venture the opinion
that he will become a stlllstronger favor
ite before the men enter the ring. What
ever may be the future, of- betting In
this city, the men who like -to have a bit
up on their favoritS boxers will have an
opportunity- to do so,. at least this time.
The Injunction restraining the police from
interfering will not have been dissolved
until after this fight has been decided.
In addition to the main event the Colum
bia Athletic Club management has ar
ranged two promising preliminaries. Toby
Trwin and Willie Cole will appear In a fif
teen-round bout, while George Curran and
Chick Finnerty will box ten rounds. Jack
Welch will referee the fifteen-round v af
fair as well as the main event.
The whirlwind fighters of the San Fran-
Neill's victory over Australian Tim Mur- '
phy sent his stock booming. This is* shown j
in the betting on his meeting with Mof- {
fatt. The pressure of money on the Call- i
cisco Athletic Club will perform to-mor
row night in the club's Sixth-street gym
nasium. Alex Greggains, matchmaker
and referee, has nine bouts scheduled, all
THE doubt and uncertainty -which
hovered over the meeting between
Boxers AlNeill and Jack Moffatt have
been entirely dispelled. The men have
entered upon the last -week of their pre
paratory work, free from any injuries
which might affect their chances in the
ring- on Friday right._ Moffatt has had no
setback since his arrival here, and the ex
tra week's work which the postponement
of the bout gave him has been in the na
ture of a windfall. He has gone on stead- :
ily in his work, taking advantage of every
moment of the time.
Neill's arm Is pronounced absolutely
sound, and he will enter the ring ready to
defend his title, to all the honors of the
ring which he has won during his short
but meteoric career.
of which promise the usual excitement in
cidental to these tournaments.
Boxers Tried Out.
Tommy Cox, the recently arrived 120
pound boxer, who lays claim to the feath
er-weight championship of Australia, was
%iven a "try-out" at the San Francisco
Athletic Club last evening. None of the
natives appeared anxious to give the little
man from the antipodes a go, so Charley
Thurston, the welter-weight, was brought
forward. Cox, who was sadly out of con
dition, made an excellent showing with
the heavier man. He proved an adept in
the art of ducking and side-stepping,- and
will not long be kept on tt\e waiting list.
Another Impromptu affair was a four
round bout between Alonzo Tucker, a col
ored middle-weight from Keswick, and
Bob Hodges of Montana. It is claimed
Tucker made Van Buskirk quit in four
rounds, but the latter lighter must have
been on stilts when he did so. In the sec
ond round, by a series of skyrocket up
percuts, Hodges had Tucker nearly down
to the Queer-street ferry, but he recov
ered, and honors were even at the close.
Boxer Jack Moffatt,. the Chicagoan, Tossing tie Medicine Ball.
The hearing of the action by -which the
National . Athletic Club seeks to enforce
Tax Collector Scott to withdraw his
ing declaring the club's license forfeited
was continued before Judge Murasky yes-
National Club's Contention.

Mayor's Ofice That the Municipal
Deficit May Be Wiped
Out.
Plan Discussed at a Conference in the
It- was practically decided at a secret
conference of the Mayor, Auditor and'
Supervisors' Finance Committee held in
the Mayor's office yesterday afternoon to
have the legal status of J.he St. Marys
Park appropriation of $125,000 determined
in court. Various plans were dis
cussed to save the city officials from
being associated with the scheme, and the
proposition of having some one or more of
the city's creditors bring the matter of
adjudication was the most favored.
The plan contemplates the presentation
of a demand on the Auditor about the
middle oi this month by sorau merchant
creditor. That official Having set aside
the moneys required for salaries for
June, St. Marys i-*arii fund and certain
'â¢tlier contracts heretofore entered into,
including those for light and water, Ber
r.al ParK, Bosworth-street tunnel and a
new police station, will refuse to sign the
demand presented on the ground that
there is no money to pay it with. The
creditor will then bring suit mandamusing
the Auditor to draw on the moneys on
hand. This will result in a decision as to
whether lhe fund for St. Marys Park is
held to be inviolate or whether it can be
used for other purposes.
This course is deemed necessary in the
endeavor to wipe out the municipal de
ficit which Expert Williams stated Would
be approximately $105,000. The Auditor pro
duced figures at the conference placing
the deficiency at $153,000, but the amount
was reduced to William's' figures by the
discovery Of certain other moneys which
will come to the city during the next four
weeks. Tax Collector Scott informed those
present that Lhe estimate of SS5.UO0 due the
city on protested taxes had been found
to be 195,1)00, which will add $10,000 to the
depleted funds.
lhe commission* on collateral inherit
ance taxes and poll taxes, amounting to
JlNWV, which Treasurer Brooks has not
transferred to the unapportioned fee fund
as required by the charter, are expected
to swell the funds also, and other addi
tional revenues will probably bring the
doticit down to SI Co. 000.
The Mayor stated that he would Inter
view both the Treasurer and the Assessor
iind endeavor to settle the affair so that
they would relinquish all claim to the
commissions in order that the money may
be applied to paying the city's debts. The
Mayor held that the case was not one for
Grand Jury Investigation; but that he pos
tessed the power, vested in him by the
charter, to bring atout a solution of the
difficulty. As Treasurer Brooks is under
stood to desire a court order to turn the
commissions ovtr to the city a pretty
struggle may be on to determine that dis
puted point.
The plan to permit the adjudication of
the St. Marys Park fund question through
creditors is interesting, from the fact that
the City Attorney has decided that the
money cannot be diverted to other uses,
and the Supervisors recently passed a res
olution providing that the money should
be set aside by the Auditor and Treas
urer for the purchase of the property for
the proposed park. The resolution has
been complied with bv the two officials
named, but It 5f certain that a court de
cision will be invoked before the contro
versy is finally settled. The charter pro
vides for the payment of demands In the
order cf their presentation, and this point
way be utilize.l to shut out the demands
en St. Marys Park fund.
The Board of Supervisors will meet this
afternoon at 2 o'clock for the purpose of
devising ways and means to relieve the
financial stringency and also for the pur
pose of passing numerous demands, wnlch
were laid over from Monday's meeting.

ST. MARYS PARK
FUND IN VERY
GRAVE DANGER
Sets Forth in a Communication That
O'Donnell in His Letters Merely
Surmises and in Reality
- â¢" Proves Nothing.
F. W. Dohrmann has sent the following
reply to the letter of Joseph K. O'Oonneil
which was given publicity yesterday:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 5. 1900;
Mr. Joseph' E. CTIXmrwU. City-Sir: Your
letter of June 4 just reamed ir.e. In . I Uce
of substantiating your charges, you merel>
recite t*iat you were le<i to behe\e that 1
was interested in the City Street l^rove
ment Company, because you observe.! u hen
the previous street cleaning specifications
were under consideration, that Mr. JleDon
a;d consulted me before entering his con
tract; in other words, you base your cn.irge
U TTe a fa?t7^n S tbâ¢ca.se f vv^e U n'MrMcDo n aW
consulted us were that the Merchants As
sociation had provided in the specification*
for street cleaning that the street contractor
should not keep less than four watering
carts in constant u ? e to prevent
raised by his men while sweeping. \v a then
endeavored to prevent these carts beins
used and Mr. McDonald consulted our com
mittee to tln.J out whether the association
would object to have the .sprinkling car.s
provided for in the contract used in other
blocks than those your clients were sprink
linff at The expanse cf the merchants.
This consultation, therefore, was on be
half of your clients, as our officers saw no
reasons -why Mr. McDonald's carts should
sprinkle the same blocks which your cÂ»Â£""
were .ilreac!y sprinkling if they sprinkled
sufficiently to prevent dust from the wcrK
of the sweepers.
In consequence of this interview your
clients remained undisturbed wherever they
did satisfactory work and the merchants
continued to r-iy. .
FailirR to substantiate any of your pre
vious charge?, and apparently to kt-ep up
the controversy, you now proceed to maxe
another assertion as untrue as your- pre
vious ones.
You state that the ordinance prohibiting
sprinkling on bituminous streets was passed
at my suggestion.
The facts are that neither I nor the iler- .
chants' Association had ' anything to do
with it. Teamsters and others, whose ani
mals slipped on the wet pavements, com
plained, and the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals asked for the pas
sage cf this ordinance, as Mr. Holbrook,
iti secretary, informed us, and will, no
doubt, confirm.
It Is true, however, that the Mayor con
sulted our superintendent about it and was
told that he, the superintendent, saw no
objection to have this experiment tried, but
the dust became so intolerable after sprink
ling ceased that the Board of Supervisors
was petitioned to rescind the ordinance.
The Street Committee requested the Mer
chants' Association to consult with them
when this request was consiilprf-d.
After also consulting with Mr. Holbrook
and others interested in the safety of ani
mals the Mercants' Association agreed to
make thorough and practical tests to ascer
tain how, without danger to animals, the
dust could be kept down.
These experiments were made under direc
tion of Superintendent Kine and at an ex
penditure of nearly $1<JOQ, and resulted so
satisfactorily that the association favored
rescinding the ordinance prohibiting sprink
ling on bitumlnized streets.
The present specifications for street
sprinkling were prepared by our superinten
dent after these- experiments were under
way and approved by our board of directors
before belnc recommended to the Board of
Public Works. The future will prove
whether or not they are fair, practical and
likely to urove effective.
Should any further explanation of them
be required by the citizens. I shall have to
leave it to our superintendent. Mr. King,
who is more familiar with them than I am,
to furnish it.
As to myself, I Â«hall take no further no
tice of charges or insinuations .as to my
motives in ar.y action I have taken in con
nection with the efforts of the Merchants'
Association for improving the municipal
conditions of Pan Francisco unless such
charges are substantiated by proof of their
correctness. Yours trulv.

exhorted the graduates to keep In view

address, taking for his theme that life
wits more than the consciousness of exist

American war and to the war in South
Africa. The tower of Babel, he said, was
typical of the aspiring mind of man in

to the Hebrew, and said that the idea a
nation had concerning God was a largo

COOPER COLLEGE
SENDS FORTH A
LARGE CLASS
The Vschoolmarms" of the Girls' High
School are up in arms against what they
term an unwarranted action on the part
of C. C. Young, professor of Latin in the
Lowell High School. They accuse him of
going about on a proselyting expedition
with a view to obtaining recruits for the
institution with which he is connected. In
dignant comments are heard among the
feminine pedagogues of the Girls' School,
and woe betide the professor should he
come within striking distance.'
The specific charge against Professor
Young is that he urged the pupils of the
finishing class In the Spring Valley Gram
mar School to attend the Lowell High in
preference to the others. It is also al
leged that Professor Young further ex
patiated on the merits and good points to
be found only in the school of which he
is an honored exponent, and dilated espe
cially on Its magnificent plan of instruc
tion. This bit of gossip was furnished
yesterday at the class day exercises in the
Girls" High by a pupil of the Spring Val
ley School to Miss H. L. Leszynsky, who
In turn contided it to her associates, with
the result that the Young name is men
tioned with contumely and the Young per
son Is regarded as one to be avoided by
strictly ethical pedagogues, according to
the belief of these ladles.
Miss Leszynsky was greatly surprised
when she learned that the story of Pro
fessor Young's unpardonable offense had
become public property. She said when
questioned:
"One of the pupils in the Spring Valley
School informed me that Mr. Young had
urged the pupils to attend the Lowell High
School. I was greatly surprised to hear
of it. Several teachers with whom I con
versed on the subject expressed them
selves as Indignant, and it was stated,
with how much truth I am unable to say.
that this was not the first time Mr. Young
had endeavored to drum up pupils for the
Lowell."
School Director Denman had heard noth
ing regarding Mr. Young's alleged prose
lyting. He stated that there was nothing
In the rules forbidding a teacher to solicit
the attendance of pupils in other schools,
but that any active efforts in that connec
tion would be regarded as unprofessional
and would merit the attention of the
Board of Education. No formal charges
had been made, however, and no action
would be taken unless they were. Pro
fessor Ellsha Brooks, principal of the
Girls' High School, was likewise ignorant
of Mr. Young's alleged delinquency. He
stated that he had a high regard for the
Erofessor and did not think that he would
e so unprofessional as to do what had
been attributed to him. "If he did so."
said Professor Brooks, significantly, "I
should certainly go after him."
Professor Young when seen last r.ltrht
disclaimed any intention to steer pupils
to the Lowell* and away from the Girls'
High.
"All I said in my address to the pupils,"
said Mr. Young, "was that I hoped that
they -would all look forward to a high
school and university course. I did say
in a pleasant way that I would like to see
them at the Lowell If they should so elect.
But that invitation Is often given by high
school teachers. I also exhorted them not
to sidetrack themselves In a six months'
business school, but I made no extraor
dinary appeal for them to attend the
Lowell. In fact. I believe that the Girls*.
High Is a splendid school, and I would be
more pleased, indeed, if they all went
there.

Notre Dame Hall's seating capacity waa
taxed at the opening of the commencement
exercises. Palms, choice plants and ever
greens decorated the stage, while above
in white flax was the class motto. "Noth
ing So Kingly as Kindness." In the back
of the stage in light green were the fig

the snow-white dresses of the pupils made
a pleasing scene.
Notre Dame is one of the most promi
nent educational institutions on the coast,
and its alumnae include young ladies and
women in all walks of life, who eagerly
look forward to these annual gatherings.
People were present from all parts of
California to-day, and many parents came
from neighboring States to be present at
the exercises. Many priests were also in
attendance.
SAN JOSE, June 5.â Xotre Dame College

tution were well represented, and these
former students held a reunion, greeting
each other and the sisters in charge of the

wails and buildings recalled tender recol
lections to old scholars. He for one was
In favor of it staying- where it was. Others
spoke in the same vein. Dr. Fowler said
he vas sure the town would make many
concessions to keep the college where it
was and aid in subscriptions. It was
stated that by closing two of the town
streets an>l purchasing somrÂ» property the
college site could be increased about ten
acres. A motion was ilien made and car
ried unanimously tha: the alumni was in
favor of rebuilding and extenfling the col

A couple Â«'f hundred former students
wore present, and tnese talked of days
gone by. All day long they hung about
isjniliar haunts of their school days. The

custom, took on significance this year,

The opinion of the alumni was asked,
hut aft<-r visiting their alma mater these
old students decided that old adobe build
ings, aged olive trees and relies of padres
of a century ago were too sacred to de-
Ftroy or l^ave and voted as their wish for
the college to remain at Santa Clara.
Their vrfsh will be observed by the church,
as the town authorities agreed to makt
desired concessions. The alumni re

Tl'c address of the Â«-venir.g was deliv
ered by Hon. Frank J. Sullivan of San
FrÂ«r:ciseo, whose subject was, "Ratio
fckuuiorum; or. the Jesuit System of Edu
cation." The subject was suggested by
President Eliot of Harvard, in which he
attacked "the uniform prescribed educa
tion" of Jesuits. The speaker said what
is wanting in the elective system is sun
plied by the ratio studiorum of the Jesuit
order. It gives classical, scientific and
nr.oral training. It is clastic and suits ail
conditions of men. The ideas of President
Eliot were claimed to be unsound, and
Quotations were cited from Professor
Munsterborr of Harvard, Professor Hale
of Cornell. Dopew of Vale and others to
prove this. Mr. Sullivan pointed out the
many advantages of education gained in
Jesuit colleges.

All Negotiations to Secure Peace in
St. Louis Have Thus Par
Failed.
ST. LOUIS, June 5.â Negotiations be
tween the_ strikers and the St. Louis Tran
sit Company looking to a settlement of
the strike are off for the present and
probably will not be resumed until the
strikers agree not to demand the dis
charge of the men now in the employ of
the company in order that they may re
gain the positions they gave up when the
strike was declared.
Attorney Lehmann, for the Transit
Company, stated plainly to-day that every
man now in the- service of the company
must be retained in the place assigned
him. and until this is assented to by the
strikers negotiations as to other matters
are useless.
From a rioting standpoint to-day was
practically uneventful. Assaults on in
offensive passengers continued. William
A. Sander of Tilsit, Mo., and William
Deneke of Houck. Mo., were set upon and
brutally beaten by a crowd this afternoon
because they rode on a Transit Company
car. . .

Frenchmen.
CITY OF MEXICO, June 5.â The mys
terious murder of two Frenchmen travel
ing In the loneliest part of the State of
Guerrero has been cleared up. MM. Cour
mont and Depln went together into tho
State of Guerrero to look for investments
and took with them considerable cash.
On the banks of the Balsas River they
were killed, and it was given out that
they. met their deaths in a fight with an
armed force of police which tried to ar
rest them after they had fought with
boatmen.
It now develops that the unfortunate
men were assassinated as a result of a
deliberately laid plot to obtain possession
of their money. The alleged assassins in
clude the Mayor of the town of Copallio.
Francisco Sanchez, who is an Indian, and
the man who had been employed by the
Frenchmen as guide.
Before being killed the Frenchmen were
brutally tortured, their assassins trying
to compel them to reveal the whereabouts
of money which they were supposed to
have taken into the country.

IMPROVED CONVENTlON HALLS.
P SHORT time ago we directed attention to the
1 reports from Kansas City concerning the excel
* lencc of the hall which is being constructed in
that city for the use of the Democratic convention.
The building is to differ from most of the structures
that have been used for Presidential conventions in
asmuch as it is to be constructed primarily for such
gatherings and not for expositions. Thus it will have
better acoustics and oe in other ways more convenient
for the work of the delegates. It, is now reported
from Philadelphia that equal care has been taken to
provide for the Republican convention there and that
the results are likely to be even superior to those

In describing an examination made of the hall by
Chairman Manley of the Republican National Com
mittee the Philadelphia Record says: "In order to
make a complete test of the acoustics a practical trial
was decided upon. Select Councilman Harris took a
l>ofition on the stage near where the speakers' table
will be, and the inspecting party posted themselves in
different parts of the hall. A few sentences were ut-
Urcd in a slightly raised tone of voice by Councilman
Harris, and every word could be heard distinctly in
the most remote part of the hall." Henry C. Payne
cf the National Committee, who assisted in the ex
amination, h quoted cfi faying: '"Never in the history
of the party has any city provided such a convention
hall. It is a marvel :n every way and could not be
These improvements in the structures used for na
tional conventions arc by no means unimportant mat
ters. It is in the highest degree desirable that every
delegate in the convention should hear what is Roinjy
on and what !s said by the speakers from the platform.
Had the Democratic convention of 1896 been held in
a lull where the voices, of men like Russell of Massa
chusetts couid have been heard the country would
have been spared the nomination for the Presidency

RARE SPECIMEN
OF GOLD QUARTZ
PERSONAL MENTION.
A REPORTED ORANGE PARASITE.
ORANGE orchardists are reported to be much
alarmed over the northward movement of a
parasite known as the "Mexican orange mag
got," which is said to be extremely destructive and
very difficult to exterminate. Although called "Mexi
can," the pest is said to have made its first appearance
near the Isthmus of Panama. It has gradually worked
its way through Central America to Mexico, and is
now said to be approaching the American border.
The orange-growefs of California are not going
to be caught napping by a threatening danger of that
kind. Agricultural Quarantine Officer Craw has di
rected the attention of the commission to the pest
and advised that radical measures be taken to pre
vent its entering the State. Our reports add that the
orchardists in Southern California have communi
cated with parties all over the State urging that' the
Western Representatives at Washington be asked to
hasten at an early date the passage of the national
horticultural quarantine bill, governing the importa
tion of fruits, trees and plants from foreign countries
and between States. Upon the request of the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the local chamber
sent a dispatch to Senator Perkins urging him to in
terest his corepresentatives in the passage of the bill.
In all matters of pests public panic exaggerates the
danger, and it is probable the fear in this case is
much greater than there is any reason for. The pest
has not destroyed the orange industry of Mexico, for
that country will have millions of oranges to ship
this year. Nevertheless it would be foolish to admit
a pest of any kind when by the exercise of due dili
gence it can be kept out of the State and the coun
try. For that reason it is to be hoped the efforts made
to hasten the passage of the national horticultural
quarantine bill will succeed. As Congress is about to
close the session, however, it is hardly likely the
measure can be passed at once. Such being the case,
it will devolve upon California to stand guard for her
self.
It is said that as the pest is of the same color as the
fruit it is very hard to detect, and there is danger it
may, be brought into the State with the oranges im
ported from Mexico or Central America. A close
watch, of course, will have to be kept to prevent the
threatened evil. Forewarned is forearmed, and now
that our people have had their attention directed to
the danger it is to be hoped we shall be able to avert
it. Certainly the orange-growers will have the cor
dial assistance of all officials having authority in the
matter and of the people generally in. whatever they
undertake to save the State from a pest which would
injure one of its largest and most profitable indus
tries. V
PROSPECTS OF THE SHIPPING BILL.
WHILE there is just ground for dissatisfaction
that the merchant marine bill was not enacted
at this session of Congress, there is some con
solation in the reports from Washington that it has
been placed on the calendar of each House with a
favorable recommendation from the committee of the
Senate and of the House and will have early con
sideration at the coming session. The prospects are
therefore promising, and this Congress may yet have
the honor of enacting the law that will restore Amer
ican shipping to its former rank on the ocean and
relieve the country from the tribute it now pays to
foreign ship-owners for carrying its commerce.
It is not at all likely the bill will be forgotten dur
ing the summer. The pledge to enact legislation to
promote American shipping will have a prominent
place in the Republican platform of this year, as it has
in former years, and will be one of the issues of the
campaign. The people now understand the subject
better than ever. The need of a merchant marine to
carry our expanding and increasing commerce is more
imperative than ever. Candidates for Congress in
making the campaign of the fall will find everywhere
that from these needs there has grown up a sentiment
in favor of legislation designed to augment our ocean
.shipping which cannot be ignored.
In a recent interview on the subject Senator Frye
set forth in a brief space the argument for the bill.
He is quoted by the New York Sun as saying: "Few
of our people realize that three-quarters of all of our
exports go to Europe, and that two-thirds of our
entire foreign trade is with Europe. Our dependence
on foreign tonnage, especially British tonnage, em
phasizes the weakness and danger of our foreign
trade, so long as its chief commercial and maritime
rival is its largest carrier. * * * A rise in freights
accompanies the withdrawal of any considerable por
tion of the tonnage upon which we are dependent for
our foreign carrying, a situation much emphasized at
the present moment. There is another side to this
truth that is deserving of our thought, and it is that
the addition of a large amount of new tonnage is sure
correspondingly to reduce freights. The shipping
bill in providing for a large increase in tonnage thus
automatically provides for a reduction in oc^an
freights. Through this natural law the American
people will receive back in reduced freights much
moreâ fully three times as much, as I see it â than the
Government will pay out in aiding in the establish
ment of our shipping in the foreign trade."
Such, in a short space, is the argument for the bill.
That argument is now becoming generally under
stood. All the old-time objections to the measure
have been refuted over and over again. The Repub
lican pledge of i8q6 to. enact legislation to promote
American shipping remains as yet unfulfilled, but the
fulfillment is evidently not far off. Before another
winter passes we may expect to see it carried out by
the enactment of a law which will be gratifying to
every patriot.
THE HIGH FENCE ORDINANCE.
SAX FRANCISCO is to be congratulated upon
the vote of eleven to six by >jhich the Super
visors on Monday passed to print an ordinance
limiting fences used for advertising purposes to a
height not exceeding ten feet. When the measure
comes up for rmal acron it should be adopted unani
mously, for it is a marked step in the direction of
ridding the city of one of the most unsightly of pub
lic nuisances.
In the first section the ordinance declares it unlaw
ftd to erect in the city any fence of wood or other in
tlzmmable material exceeding ten feet in height above
the level of the sidewalk without the permit of the
Board of Public Works. The second section pro
vi ie* that no permit shall be granted for such fence
unless it be designed and maintained as a windbreak
cr as a means to protect the public from injury from
any building in the course of construction or repair.
The third section classifies any fence built or main
tained in violation of the law as a public nuisance,
which it is the duty of the Chief of Police, under the
direction of the Boaid of Public Works, to abate
forthwith; and the fourth section declares all fences
of ir.fiainmnble material exceeding ten feet in height
above the sidewalk subject to the supervision of the
Board oi Public Works, and requires them to be con
structed and maintained to the satisfaction of the
board.
The ordinance is not all that public interests re
quire, for advertising fences should have been ex
cluded from the principal business streets of the city
rltogether and limited to a height of ten feet else
where; but the pa??age of the measure will never
theless mark a notable public improvement. It will
be greeted, therefore, with general satisfaction, and
a cordial approval be given to the action of those
Supervisor? whose fidelity to public interests has been
shown by their votes in favor of it.

Epigrams from a recent contribution to Harper'3 Weekly by Professor Jordan.
She has some clear and critical sense of the relative valua
of different men and actions.
College life is not an unserving process, neither is it a course
of professional training. Â»
The college woman has the association of some of the
brightest, most devoted young women she will ever meet.
The college is not the only means of securing education.
But training and culture must be gained In some way if a
woman is to reach her best possibilities or to make herself at
tractive to the best of men. ,s
The idea is prevalent that the educated woman is spoiled
for humbler duties; that she will play the piano in the parlor
while her mother cooks in the kitchen. As to this I can only
say it is not the fact.
A variety of delusions which/real knowledge would dissipate,
and which now add unprecedented terrors to matrimony derive
their support from women who have leisure to read, but who
have never been trained to think.
Wherever the college girl may go her Interests will not be
bounded by the range of neighborhood gossip nor the interests
of the parish.
The victims of fraud and quackery are numbered among
women each year by the thousands. The college women fur
nish a very small part of this quota.
If a girl is fitted for a profession sh*Â» will distinctly feel a
"call" for its work. But this she must know, there is no gal
lantry In science or in art.
She will not gain success on any but the most exacting of
terms, the same terms on which a man might win the same
success.
Coffege Women Best Fitted for Motherhood.
WITH ringing class yells and Jolly
songs the class of '00 of the Girls'
High School made a pilgrimage
to the various departments of
their alma mater yesterday afternoon,
sent telegrams to the professors, had a
delightful luncheon in which the sub
graduates and the "specials" joined them
and concluded their day with a dance to
excellent music. It was "class day," as
the faculty put it. and the "jinks" as the
graduates preferred it. But whichever
way It was it was a jolly affair in which
a bunch of happy, pretty girls reveled to
their hearts' content.
At 12:30 o'clock the girls assembled at
the school looking their best in fetching
white shirt waists and washfabric skirts.
They formed in line and in double file
paid their last visit as pupils to the school
conservatory, Miss Hunt's science reclta-
tlon room. Mrs. Wilson's Greek and Latin
classroom. Miss Jewett's department of
mathemati6s, Mrs. Prag's history class
room. Miss Thompson's English room and
Mr. Goldstein's art room. In each class
room there were appropriate exercises
and although there was much laughter
here and there a tear was brushed away.
After the pilgrimage was completed the
school's special messenger delivered tele
grams to the various heads of the depart
ments. These messages were filled to the
brim with compliments to the instructors
and timely topical hits. Professor Franz
Goldstein was declared winner in the con
test for the Alameda Exposition of 2000
A. D.; Miss Wilson received word of her
appointment by the President to the high
post of American Consul to the Fiji Is
lands. The Secretary of the Interior sent
Mrs. Prag word that she was appointed
president of the newly established college
"for the preparing of prospective Sena
tors." Professor George Otis Mitchell
was informed that he had been chosen
president of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. Professor Brooks was com
plimented by Benjamin Ide Wheeler on
the proficiencies of the graduating class.
! Mies Jewett received a courteous demand
for the solving of an intricate probiam
and Miss Helen Thompson was asked to
take charge of a class in elocution. TKe
telegrams were an entirely new feature
of the Jinks and were voted a great suc
cess.
A lunch followed by dancing brought
the jinks to a close. The young ladies
who had charge of the affair were as fol
lows:
President. MiÂ«s Josephine Scavey; secretary.
Miss Freda Beyhauaen. Assistantsâ Miss Ethel

THE STATE ELECTIONS.
STATE elections during the summer and fall
preceding Presidential elections are not so im
portant now from a national point of view as
they were in former years when some of the larger
and more doubtful States held elections at that time.
They no longer afford a safe means of forecasting the
coming result of the Presidential vote, and for that
reason are not watched and studied with the intense
interest that used to be felt. Still they foreshadow the
future to some extent, and even where a Republican
or a Democratic victory is a foregone conclusion
something may be learned of the temper of the peo
ple by noting how the vote of the successful party
compares with its vote' in former years.
Oregon has led the way by giving, the Republicans
a victory that augurs well for the future. The resuit
of the contest was hardly regarded as doubtful at any
time, for while it has- a large independent vote the
State is normally Republican, and this year the inde
pendents are on the side of the administration.
There were some features, however, that made the
contest interesting. The Democratic, Populist and
Silver Republican fusion was arranged harmoniously
and well organized, and was able to poll the full
strength of the combination. On the other hani
there were some differences among the Republicans.
It was noted that Representatives Tongue and Moody
and Senator McBridc, whose successor is to be
elected by the new Legislature, voted for the Porto
Rjco bill, while Senator Simon, who is supposed to
be the leader of the Republican party in the State,
voted against it. Under such circumstances the
sweeping victory for the whole ticket on Monday is
one upon which Republicans may reflect with no little
gratification.
There remain to be held elections in North Caro
lina, August 2; Alabama, August 6; Arkansas, Sep
tember 3; Vermont. September 4: Maine, September
io: and Georgia, October 3. None of these can be
called doubtful State?, for although North Carolina
has now .1 Republican Governor and one of its Sena
tors is Republican and the other a Populist, it is not
considered likely that the fusion which carried them
into ofiice can be successful again, and the State is
fairly certain to return to the Democratic fold. The
only thing that renders such a result in the least un
certain is the growing strength of manufacturing and
business interests, which have developed a wide
spread sentiment in favor of the Republican policies
of protection and sound money among former Demo
crats, and may cause a good many of them to refuse
to vote with the Bryanites even in a State election.
Taking all things into consideration, the Oregon
vote may be regarded the best basis for calculations as
to the Presidential vote that will be given. It shows
that while there are differences of opinion among
Republicans upon some of the important issues now
before the country, yet the voters prefer to intrust
the settlement of those issues to the Republican party
rather than to the Democrats.
GIRL GRADUATES SHAKE A
DA-DA TO THEIR STUDIES
THE FOUNDERS Of REPUBLICANISM.
ONE of the happy thoughts of the committee in
charge of the Republican National Convention
was tjiat of inviting the survivors of the first
national 'gathering of Republicans to meet with the
convention at Philadelphia. So far as is known, only
fourteen of the stalwart men who laid the founda
tions of the party are still among the living. The
others who fought the good fight and kept the faith
of the declaration of independence and maintained
the cause of freedom have passed away. Small, how
ever, as is the band of survivors, it will be a con
spicuous group in the great hall/ and be honored with
all the veneration due to illustrious old age.
In the invitations the committee points out to the
veterans the mighty changes which time and the up
ward trend of popular sentiment and the increase of
population have made in the strength of the party they,
formded. The committee says: "Nearly half a cen
tury has elapsed since you participated in laying the
foundation of the Republican party. You have wit
nessed its magnificent growth from a popular vote
of 1,341,264 and 114 electoral votes cast for Fremont
in 1856 to a popular vote of 7,104,779 and 271 electoral,
votes for McKinley in 1896, and therefore the Repub
licans of to-day, profoundly appreciating the work of
yourself and other pioneers of our party, will feel
honored by your distinguished presence, and we as
sure you a most cordial welcome."
Never was there a political gathering in the United
States whose members are more deserving of the
honor of the people than that which formed the Re
publican party in 1856. To attend that convention
required courage pi no mean order. The conservatism
of the country was on the side of slavery, and while
the Whigs were perhaps not so subservient to the
slave power as were the Democrats, they were never
theless very far from favoring any aggressive action
tending toward its overthrow. The men who founded
the Republican party, notwithstanding the moderation
of their speeches and the strictly constitutional nature
of the planks of their platform, were denounced as
abolitionists and incendiaries. It was said they de
sired to break up the Union. They had to face all
manner of obloquy, and none but strong men as well
as sincere men dared to face the antagonism of the
time and take part in the formation of a party devoted
to humanity and pledged to the principle that so long
as'lavery existed in the United States it should exist
as a sectional institution only, and that freedom
should be national.
A glorious future awaited the party founded by such
resolute and far-seeing men. The hour of their tri
umph soon came. Because of their triumph the
slave-holders sought to destroy the Union, but under
the guidance of the first Republican President the war
was fought to a conclusion that abolished slavery,
saved the Union, increased the prestige of the nation
throughout the world, and then the Republican party
adopted those wise measures of reconstruction that
have made a united people, and gave to the. republic
throughout all its wide domain a harmony of senti
ment never known before.
With such a glorious history the party may well
give honor to the founders who laid its foundations
on principles so broad and so strong that to this day
there has been no occasion to change or add to them.
In its principles the party remains as the founders
made it, and the survivors of the first convention who
are able to be at the Philadelphia conve/ition will find
themselves surrounded by a new generation, but
greeted with the same spirit of devotion to the wel
fare of the Union and to human freedom which ani
mated the gathering of 1856.

and 1S40. literature rose again. Carlyle.
Newman. Thackeray and Dickens, as well
as Tennyson and Browning, all made their
first appearance before the English public
in these ten years. Literature thus rose
In a two-fold glory, of poetry and proseâ
and. Indeed, of the two. proseâfiction and
essay â is perhaps the more significant art
form of the modern world. It has at least
advanced through modern times stop by
step with poetry, and has reached an
amplitude and expressiveness never
known before. The life of modern poetry
is vigorous and notable, but it does not
shine with a radiance that almost obliter
ates all else, as it did in the days of Spen
ser and Shakespeare, or in the days of
Wordsworth and Shelley. The great names
of the Victorian period, leaving out the
novelists, are Carlyle, Newman. RusKtn,
quite as much as Tennyson and Browning,
and Clough and Rossetti; they are also
rames of men equally at home in either
form of expression, like Matthew Arnold
and William Morris.
But it is cause for gratitude that we
should have had a groat poetry at all in
the Victorian period. For poetry belongs
to the ages of faith and enthusiasm, and
JOHN RUSKIN.
ours has seemed to many people an age
of doubt and cautious experiment. Poetry
rings the clarion note of joy in life, and
too often it has seemed as if pessimism
antfc weariness were Invading the modern
world. Poetry is nourished by the unseen
forces of emotion and aspiration, and our
practical age has fceen eager above all in
the discovery and application of the me
chanical forces of physical nature. Science
rather than imagination has ruled the
day. Ar.d yet we have needed poets, and
they have arisenâ no one poet, perhaps,
like Milton In the seventeenth century or
Dante in the fourteenth, but real and
â¢Teat poets who will not die. Surely this
means that humanity has not become less
sensitive to the spiritual universe as con
trol over the lorces of the physical uni
verse widens and deepens.
Tennyson and Browning are doubtless
the greatest poets of the Victorian era.
They began to write first; they kept on
longest; their work had more volume,
more variety in Us beauty, more express
iveness... than that of any other men.
Their first books struck quite new notes.
Can we say that now of any one among
the young poets who are asking our at
tention year bv year?
Tennyson's first volume came out in 1S33.
The poems in It bore the mark of youth,
but already they showed that fairy fineness
of ear which was to characterize him to
the end. Several of them expressed the
mood of inward brooding which has so
belonged to our century. In all. the poet
reached that final test of a poet's genuine
ness a melody wholly individual. In the
same year appeared Browning's "Pauline."
and it was an achievement yet more sig
nificant, for it handled a new method at&
achieved a new endâ the close self -reveia.-
far as his home, where he would pro
duce the licenses.
Strategy saved the poundmen from com
plete humiliation. Hickman marched the
municipal outfit down Stanyan street to
Page, where Deputy Welch requested per
mission to get an unlicensed cur that he
said was being held for him. He broke
faith with his captor as soon as he was
out of sight and slipped across the park
to the police station, where he notified
Officer Bonner of the hold-up. Bonner
quickly disarmed the man behind the
shotgun and arrested him. Not until then
did the deputies breathe freely again and
the rush of fresh air into their lungs
nearly produced a congestion. Hickman
was released on bail a little later and soon
appeared at the public potuid for his dogs.
As he took them away he explained that
he was a pigeon shot of no little note and
could wing eleven out of twelve birds at
the traps. He also imparted the cheerful
information that If the policeman had not
arrived so soon and there had been any
more fooling he would have winged a dog
taker or two.
and in a minute two of the pets were
netted and dumped into the pound wagon.
The third escaped. At that point Hick
man rode up on a bicycle and demanded
that his pups be liberated, stating that
he had licensr? for all three. He was told
to go to the pound and recover his prop
erty, as provided by law. The driver of
the wagon headed for a roadside estab
lishment to telephone to headquarters
and the bicyclist hastened down the
street. He went, but to return.
In a few minutes he came back looking
like a member of a military bicycle corps.
Over his shoulder was a big shotgun,
which he examined and then brought to
bear upon the official clop catchers. As
they gazed into the open, expressive coun
tenance of the firearm every one of the
deputies wished that he could change
places with the meanest cur in the cov
ered wagon. Hickman informed the depu
ties that he had come for the dogs and
contemplated making no failure of the
expedition. The panhandle Bart was will
ing, however, to compromise a little by
agreeing to accompany his captives as
*"X ff H. HICKMAN of 1757 Page street

by holding up with a loaded shot
gun the municipal vehicle which conveys
stray dogs to the pound. Hickman es
chewed the vulgar mask and hence can
be easily identified when his case comes
up in the Police Court, charges of threats
to kill and assault with a deadly weapon
having been made against him. The man's
troubles were caused by his love for a
pair of fox terriers which three of the
Poundmasters' deputies had captured
while the dogs were running at large
without tags.
About 7 o'clock Deputies Pat Hughes,
Harry Danz and John Welch discovered
Hickman's three terriers frisking about
near the Stanyan-street entrance to the
park. None of the animals wore the brass

men spiritual pantheism of Wordsworth
and Shelley, powerfully drawn toward
Christianity, yet unabie either to accept
or to reject it. these poets sung in a
piercing elegiac strain the sorrows, the
consolations, the resolutions of the ir.ner
'The sea of faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's
shore
Lay like the folds of a bright glrdte curled;
But; now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar.
Retreating; to the breath
Of the night wtnd. clown the vast edges drear
And naked shir.jrles of the world."
So wrote Arnold, with mournful elo
ouence and polished art. In his "Dover
Beach.' and Clough echoed the plaint In
lines pulsing with perhaps more entirely
sincere passion, if less perfectly and.
felicitously phrased:
"Eat. drink and die, for we are souls bereaved:
Of all the creatures undÂ»r heaven's high cope."
WÂ« are most hopeless who had once most hope.
And moat beliefHeas who had once believed."
They arose, these poets of the de3ire3
and regrets of the spirit; but their day
was not lons, though they left verse that
for certain thoughtful, wistful people will
never lose iss power. Clough died in J'>a
a little later and Arnold had turned away
from poetry, sinking as his swan song
his beautiful "Thyrsis," an elegy on his
friend, and had devoted himself to his
illuminating work as a critic in prose.
Tennyson and Browning had been before
the public for fifteen years when these
poets began to write; their poetic expres
sion continued for nearly thirty years
longer. â¢
About the time when Arnold and Clough
fell on silence there made itself heard la
our poetic literature a new cryâ the cry
for beauty. Evolutionary science, with
its passion for investigation; the democ
racy, with its enthusiasm for averages.
were in full swing; hut there arose a pro
test not to be subd;fed. a protest that as
serted as the rightful attitude wonder
rather than investigation, and devoted it
self to the quest of the rare, the strange,
the lovely, rather than to the analysis of
the commonplace.
.The prose writings of Ruskln, widely
read since the early forties, had done
much to stimulate this mood; much, too,
had been done by the pre-Raphaelite
movement in painting; more still, perhaps.
v.-as due to the strong, inevitable reaction
from the ugliness and vulgarity which
since the Introduction of machine manu
facture had been submerging England.
Rossetti, Morris, Swinburne, were the
three poets who dedicated themselves to
this movement for the revival of beauty â
knights of the romantic temper we well
might call them. Two of them, Rossetti
and Morris, expressed their feeling
through visible art as well as through
verse. Rossetti through strange, troub
ling pictures: Morris through varied de
lightful experiments in the decorative
arts. The lovely poems of all three,
charged as they were with color and pas
sion, formed a welcome interlude indeed
in oiur age of prose. Yet they were ex
otics rather than natural growths. Such
poems as Roj<setti's "Rose Mary," Swin
b'irne'9 "Atalarta in Calydon" or Morris'
"Earthly Paradise" could express only a
few of the manifold cravings of modern
I life, and these not probably the moat sig
nificant. This school, too, soon waned
By ISSO Rossetti wrote no more; Morri3
I was turned socialist, and no longer "the
I idle dreamer of an empty day," but a vig
orous, practical reformer, was trying to
recreate thH actual world In an image of
beauty. Swinburne, indeed, still lives, yet
it is fair to say that, after comparative
youth, he found no new note to strike;
his poetry simply repeated a familiar mu
sic, and since he Â¦was poet rather by virtue
of melody than of noble thought or pas
sion, his day of real power was brief.
Still, side by side, the two stronger spir
its held on their way. Novelists, essay
ists, as well as poets, appeared and van
ished. Ruskln and Arnold replaced Car
lyle and Newman as leaders, and their
power in turn wa3 in the late eighties
passing to its decline. It was not till 13&3
that Browning died; in 1592 Tennyson's
spirit "crossed the bar" of Time. 'Within,
the last ten years only have we been,
able to look at their work as a whole, to
"discern, compare and judge at last" their
power and their message.

various establishments. Actions praying
for permanent injunctions to restrain
Chief Sullivan from executing his threat
to close their establishments were filed
yesterday by Harry E. Corbett, Daniel J.

In their petitions for injunctions the
pln'.ntiffs f^et forth that they are now In
the quiet and peaceable possession of
businesses known as poolselling and book
making, which businesses yield their re
spective owners more than $3000 a year.
All confess that poolselling and bookmak
ing are their only vocations and their only
sources of livelihood.
Chief of Police Sullivan, they say, con
tends that their vocations are unlawful
and threatens to close them out and con

In conclusion trie petitioners, after asÂ»

CITIZEN HICKMAN DARINGLY
HOLDS UP THE POUND WAGON
XXIV. THE AGE OF TENNYSON
AND BROWNING.
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER.
The age of Tennyson and Browning is
practically the Victorian age of English
literature. To name a period from a sov
ereign may seem arbitrary and foolish,
but it is often convenient, and in this case
it has really some significance. Â»The work
of Tennyson and Browning begins only a
few years before the accession of the
Queen, and its whole sweep and power is
included within the fifty years from 1S10
to 1S90.
The Victorian period, however, is quite
distinct in character from the period that
went before; separated from it by a com
plete change in spirit and the emergence
of a new set of controlling ideas. From
the time of the French revolution, at the
end of the eighteenth century, to the
deaths of Keats, Shelley and Byron, which
happened between 1520 and 1S23, English
poetry had soared and sung like Shelley's
skylark â in the free heaven of idealism.
Prose had been vigorous during these
great thirty years, but quite subordinate
to poetry. The day was to the dreamer of
dreams and seers of visionsâ and what vis
ions they were that Shelley and Keats be
held!
When the music of these wonderful singr
ers had ceased there followed a short lull,
in which nothing of. great interest was
i ucn of character through the dramatic
i monologue. From this time the two great
poets continued to produce for upward oÂ£
fifty years. Si far as art-forms went,
their dâ¬.-velopment was in curious contrast.
I Browning besan with drama; soon dis
i carded it as a formal, artistic method.
! passed through a brilliant series of dra
matic monologues to that unique epic
which marks the high water of his
; achievement. '"The Ring and tP.e Book":
i theft; during his later years, produced a
| number of narrative noems. more or less
! ironic in character: while his old age was
| finally marked by a revival of lyrical pas
sion and power. Tennyson's development
almost reversed this order. He. too. at
tempted the drama, but late in life and
without striking success. His early years
were given to lyric and narrative, and his
Â¦work culminated in that profound revela
tion of the sufferings and aspirations of
i his own spirit, his "In Memoriam." De
spite the divers experiments made by each
we may safely say that the genius of
Browning was primarily and permanently
dramatic, for even his lyrics and narra
tives are suffused by dramatic instincts,
while the work of Tennyson just as clear
ly is lyrical in its Inmost impulse.
While the great masters wrote other
poets rose and fell. Between laoO and ISO)
appeared those thoughtful poets of the
| inr.er life. Matthew Arnold and Arthur
Hugh Clough. They represent the mood
of a period deeply affected by the tracta
rian movement and by the widespread
religious unrest that was affecting thÂ«Â»
nation. Dissatisfied with the vague if

permanent results. Alter taking two
littles of Eleetrozcne tÂ»eean to improye,
and now- after the fourth ncte that my
finmach Is In better condition than fur
icany years. The yweiiine and pain
have entirely ilisarrwarcj from my
hands and limb?. Can walk without

Concerning a Irletliod of Curing Dys-
pepsia and Stomach Troubles.
DjFprpFia and indigestion are consid-
ered incurable by many people who do not
r^a.ise the advance made In modern medl-
ral science. nn d because by the old
m- "iods and remedies a cure was rarely
:f over obtained.
rÂ»y. c popsia is now cured as readily n.%
acy other disease.
What the dyspeptic wants is "abundant
nutrition, which means plenty of good,
wholesome, well-cooked food, and Fome-
liir.g to assist the weak stomach to Ji-
rest It. This is exactly the purpose for
v.hic. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
adapted and this is the raetlicd by which
they cure the worst eases of <ly?pepsla. in
other word? th^ patient eats plenty of
v'aolesorr.o food and Bteart's Dyspepsia
Tablets direst it for him. In this way
the FV5tem is nourished and the over-
worked stomsch rested, because the tab-
lets wl.l digest the food whether the Ptorn-
ach works <>r not. One of theÂ«e tablets
will digest "T.W grains of meat or eggs.
Your druggist will tell you that Steu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets is a remedy sold
on its merits, an^l is the purest, safest ar.-l
cheapest remedy sold for stomach
troubles, and every trial makes one mere,
friend for this excellent preparation.

NEW YORK. June 5. â The stock market
Bhowed fjtnptoms of strength at various timrs
to-day, but the pressure to sell at the ad
vano* proved too much for the limited demand
to al-sorb end the latter part of the day was
#riven ever to a desultory downward move
which carried prices b*low last night's level
exwpt for a few stocks. The Htrength of a
few shares was In faÂ£t the principal sustaining
Infiumc? of the market at al! time*. The best
wjj>lftrt of this character came from Atchis-jn
preferred, which began to mcive upward early
in rhÂ» day in anticipation of the dividend an
nounw-nient. The declaration of a 24 per cent
dividnnd had ix-^-n accurately foreea&tc-d and
tin- advance in the stock c&me to a standstill
when the dividend was announced. After
hanging sluggishly for a time the advance was
resumed on the giving out of the directors'
Â«ilniates of the net earnings for the fiscal
year, showing a handsome surplus over the
full .". per cent dividend requirement for the
preferred Ftork. Atchison preferred thereupon
rose to 7<Â»i. which ie en a leval with the high
record price rr.ade two months ago. Baltimore
ar.d Ohio, Union Pacific and Missouri Pacific
sympathized strongly with Atchison. The other
::..;â¢::! of the day to attract most attention
v . > : :.- Sugar ulvidend. which was maintained
at the tame rat* of IVi jjer cent. as the last.
The movement of this stock showed that the
recent buying has been based on accurate fore
knowledge of this result. The rise Df % at
the opening was followed by a decline of 3Â«i
<:n profit-taking and the rally was only feeble.
ThÂ«-re waÂ» a general but slight advance at
the opening In expectation of the favorable
effect ui>on foreign markets of the occupation
of Pretoria, "but this expectation proved de
lusive fend the market* at London. Paris and
Berlin ail turned heavy before the clcse. The
Â«l:me here was dull and dit-tlnctlvely heavy.
Tbfre was a large demand for Western New
Tcrk and Pennsylvania general mortgage %Â¦,
but the maximum advance was not main
tained. Othc-rÂ«viÂ«; the bond market was dull
lind sluggish. Total pales, par value, $1,^S,O<X).

CHICAGO, June 5. â Corn led the markets to
day and was itrong and moderately active.
There was a demand for It reported by the
cash people and the speculative trade also
showed an Increase. The situation to all ap
pearances remained unchanged as to crop pros
pects, which were still declared to be of a
rosy hue. Offerings from Nebraska were larger
and some of the elevators sold, but the de
mand from ouiÂ«i(3ers and local bulls of In
fluence, together with covering by snorts, was
sulTlcIent to advance the market despite the
larger offerings from first hands. July closed
â¢".**< "Sic over yesterday at 3&^c, the top price
of the day.
The wheat market was a email one and the
pit where this commodity is dealt in a dull
place. The Northwest was a seller, thus giv
ing support in a practical way to reports of
gocd rains In that section of the country.
There were other reports, however, " which as
sorted that the Dakotas and neighboring ter
ritory could stand much more moisture than
has been received this season. The corn
strength furnished the main support and shorts
bought because of the nrmness In the neigh
boring pit. July closed flrm, Ho higher, at 67c.
Oats were slow but flrm. July closed H@V*c
Improved at 214c.
Provisions were ' flrm, but quiet. Moderate
hog receipts, higher prices at the yards and
the corn strength ! were the sustaining In
fluences. On. profit-taking the list eased a
trifle, but closed firm. July pork closed 5'if7%c

sonage than "Black Bart," is thÂ»
unhappy fate of \V. T., better known
as "Dick" Richardson, an employe of the
Baldwin Annex saloon.
Richardson applied for a position at the
saloon a few days ago, stating that he
waa willing to try his hand at anything.
"Jim" Orndorff, .the proprietor of the An

bartender and billiard-room attendant.
The following day John T. Dare, the
States Customs Appraiser, visited the
Annex, and after ordering a drink, called
up Orndorff and Informed him that the
barkeeper who had Just served him waa
"Black Bart."
"There Is no chance for a mistake on
my part." said Dare, "for during. 'Black
Bart's' trial my business brought. me in
contact with him daily and I am sure it
is the man."
Mr. Orndorff became Interested in the
officer's tale, and while admitting the re
semblance, said that the man had iden

that I was being served by the noted
stage robber, Black Bart, and it would
be an easy task to get any number of men
who are not accustomed to. studying
faces to positively swear that Richardson
is the man. " He is indeed a 'dead ringer ' "
Of himself Richardson has but little to
say except that he had been a cattle man
in Arizona for twenty years and had
failed for a large sum.
"This is the nrst time in my life that
I have worked for wages," he said. "I
have seen x>iac*c Bart, but do not know
him. Since I came to work here I have
been accosted by many men who have
been in San Quentin, who claim to have
met me there . and will not be convinced
that I am other than Black Bart. It is at
times annoying, but I can content myself
with the knowledge that there is nothing
in my record of which I need be ashamod
except Â¦ perhaps that I am broke." :

robber, had occasion to visit the Annex
and as he stepped to the bar a look of
surprise showed plainly on his face. It

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. June 5.
Mayor Snow in a formal message has
appealed to the City Council for author
ity to clean the streets of the city, which
he declares are in a disgracefully 'un
clean condition.
The demand is supplementary to a
resolution adopted a month ago by the
Board of Public Works directing the at
tention of the Council to the unsightly
and unsanitary state of affairs. Since
then no action has been taken. The
Mayor calls attention to the fact that
every day of delay renders the situation
more dillicult to handle, and that it will
increase the expense.
In his message the Mayor says:
"The Board of Public Works will. I be
lieve, ask your honorable body for legis
lation that will enable the Street Depart
ment to keep the streets clean hereafter,
but the long neglect of the street gutters
renders a thorough cleaning necessary
before anything else can be done."
The Mayor has been persistent in his
â¢efforts to remove unsightly accumulations
of dirt from thoroughfares. Property
owners throughout the city have been
compelled to clear the space between
street and property line, and the depart
ment is now desirous of continuing the
work upon the streets.
There is not a section of the city which
Is not greatly In need of renovation. The
gutters are foul and choked with weeds.
Catch basins are closed. That the condi
tions are serious enough from a .sanitary
point of view to warrant immediate at
tention is the opinion of the Street De
partment officials.
The neglect of the streets is due largelv
to the lack of money in the city treasury
to meet the expenses, but the Mayor has
decided to insist that steps be taken now
to find the money and to cleanse the city.
Long Neglect Has Rendered Unsight
ly and Foul the Thoroughfares
Throughout Every Section
of Oakland.
Mayor Snow Appeals to the
Council for Funds to
Remove Dirt.

FLED BECAUSE SHE
FEARED HER HUSBAND
OAKLAND, June 5.â A three years'
search by the police for Mary E. Stare
ended to-day, when she was recognized in
the Police Court dock, disheveled and un
kempt, a prisoner, accused of drunken
ness. A brutal husband and a wrecked
home are responsible for her condition.
In 1S97 S. L. Stare, a boatman, was ar
rested for trying to murder his wife with
a cleaver. She was seriously injured.
Stare was held In jail for months, pend
ing the recovery of the wounded woman.
While in bed suffering from her injuries
Mrs. Stare swore to a complaint against
her husband. One day the woman disap
peared and no trace of her whereabouts
was discovered until to-day. After she
had been identified Mrs. Stare said she
had fled to Oregon because she feared to
prosecute her husband. She remained
away two years and then returned, but
wont to San Francisco. She claimed that
her condition was caused by one drink of
brandy given to her after a fainting spell.
At the time of the assault Mrs. Stare waa
comely and fresh. To-day she is a be
draggled, wretched habitue of the slums.
OAKLAND, June 5.â Jane W. Thomas,
widow of Richard C. Thomas, the late
Berkeley capitalist, has applied for letters
of administration on his estate. The peti
tioner states that the estate consists of
stocks and bonds and real estate in Berke
ley. Thomas left no will. The heirs are
the widow, Jennie "\V. Woltmann of New
York, William Thomas of Oswego, N. Y.,
and David Thomas, whose residence is un
known.

OAKLAND, June 5.â E. C. Fellows
Lodge, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engi
neers, will give its annual ball on Thurs
flay evening at Reed Hall. Much prepara
tion in the shape of unique decoration has
been made. Special trains will be run
until a late hour both to West Oakland
and Frultvale. A large number of invita
tions have been issued for tho entertain
ment.
Railroad Firemen's Ball.
School Teacher Resigns.
OAKLAND, June 5.â The Board of Edu
cation has accepted the resignation or
Jessie D. Corner, a teacher In the Lafay
ette School.
This Is why he is looking for the man
who told him that to go camping to the
Yosemite Valley was the proper thing.
way to Stockton the Â¦ horses gave out.
Dave pushed his way to Stockton, where
he stored the outfit and decided to take
the train to the valley. He arrived in the
valley, only to find a telegram calling him
back to Oakland, because he was a direct
or in the People's Building and Loan As
sociation, of which Secretary Dewing had
been found $20,000 short. He left the val
ley without looking around, came to
Stockton, got his horses, loaded them on
the Stockton boat and returned to Oak
land.
OAKLAND. June 5.â Deputy City
Treasurer David E. Bortree Is look
ing for the man who told him that a
camping trip to the Yosemite Val
ley would be just right for his health, and
when he finds tfcat man there -will be no
mystery as to the cause of that man's
death. Mr. Bortree's trip consumed two
weeks' time, and he did not even get a
look at Vernal Falls.
Mr. Bortree promised himself a vaca
tion this year, for the first time in many
years, and some one told him that a camp-
Ing. trip to the Yosemite Valley was the
nicest thing going in the way of a sum
mer outing. For two weeks Dave has
been buying sleeping bags, camping
stoves and supplies of all kinds, and final
ly he bought a wagon and a team of
horses. Two weeks ago he moved out of
Oakland, his fellow employes giving him a
royal send-off. Yesterday he made a sud
den appearance in Oakland, declaring that
he would not be able to tell the Yosemite
Valley from Jack Hays Canyon, for he
arrived in the valley at noontime and left
for Oakland again at 1 o'clock.
But the story of his trip has just leaked
out. When he reached Livermore on his
Seme of the Incidents of Bortree's Trip.
THE committees having In charge the
arrangements for the Ofid Fellows'
annual picnic, which takes place to
morrow, have left nothing undone to
insure for their guests a pleasant and en
joyable time. The affair will be under the
ati=pices of the California, Golden Gate,
Mission, Manchester and Unity lodges,
every member of which is determined to
make their excursion to the romantic city
of Los Gatos. in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains, a long-to-be-remembered one. All
sorts of games are on the programme and
some valuable prizes are offered in com
petition.
The special train which will convey the
merrymakers to the picnic grounds will
leave Third and Townsend street* at ;Â»:13
a. m., and will stop at Twenty-fitth and
Valencia streets to take on the members
of Mission Lodge.
The outings of the Odd Fellows have al
ways been attended by the better class of
picnickers, and the rough element has
been rigidly excluded in all past events.
This year's excursion will be no exception,
and the different committees feel safe in
guaranteeing patrons a jolly time anil
a happy holiday.
The committee of arrangements' Is as
follow?: Fred L,. Griffiths, chairman: A.
Calderon. vice chairman; O. Jensrn, sec
retary: 9. If. Reynolds, treasurer: \i.

r'RANK WORTHING is to support
t Henry Miller a.t the coming- cngage
. rner.t of this star at the Columbia
Theater. Mr. Worthing has made
sacrifice to be here on the opening
i.^rht. and in this lies a story showing
that all theatrical stars are not filled with
petty jealousy of their rivals. Mr. Worth
ing has graciously relegated himself into
obscurity in the cast for the initial per
formance simply to assist his brother
actor and help make the opening a com
plete success.
When it was arranged that "Miss
Hobbs" should be the play for the first
night Worthing wa-Â« left out of the cast
by Mr. Miller. After the regular leading
people had been assigned their roles there
were only small ones left. Miller did not
desire that an actor of Mr. Worthing's
ability should be cast in a minor part, and
because of this he scheduled him a place
in the second play to be produced. This
was an act of kindly consideration on
Miller's part.
When Worthing- was notified of the ar
rangement he would none of it. His re
gard for Mr. Miller and his gratitude for
that ftar's kindly thouphtfulness in not
allowing' him to be placed in a role of
lesser magnitude caused him to at once
declare that he would appear on the open
ing- night of "Miss Hobbs," no matter how
insignificant a place might be left for
him.
To reach America in time to join Mil
ler's company In San Francisco Worthing
had to curtail his I^ondon trip. He had
Just set foot in the English metropolis
when he was notified how matters stood.
He at once pet out for New York and is
now on his way across the oce.in. The
management is delighted at his action.
The Miller company has already left Xew
York on its way west, but Worthing will
reach this city in time to appear in "Miss
Hobbs'" and help make a magnificent en

A Free Trial Package Sent by Mail
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled- for years against the mental- and
physical suffering of lost manhood that

Is a home treatment, and all men who
suffer with any form of sexual weakness
resulting from youthful folly, premature
loss of strength r.nd memory, weak back,
varicocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development Just where it is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the nat-
ural functions and has been an absolute
success in all cases. A request to tho
State Medical Institute, 32S Elektron
building. Fort Wayne, Ind.; stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will he complied with promptly. The
Institute is desirous of reaching that
great class of men who are unable to
leave home to be treated. 1 and the free
sample will enable them to see how easy
it is to be cured of. sexual weakness when
the -proper remedies are employed, . The
Institute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,

Muscle? luiltl'pC'n Postum r-ood Coffee
"For years I have not been able to
drink coffee, as it made me very ner-
vous and gave me a headache. No one
loved coffee more than I and it was a
severe trial to abandon its use. Nearly
three years ago I saw Postum Cereal
Coficc advertised and concluded to

"I have been so well pleased with it
and its healthful effects that I have used
it ever fince. I carry packages with me
when I visit other places.
"When I began to drink Postum my
muscles were ilabby, as my habits are
sedentar>f but for the past two years
my muscles have been hard and I never
felt stronger in my life than I do
now at iixty years of age, and I
attribute my strength of muscle to con-
stant use of Postum. I drink it three
times a day. I feel so enthusiastic about
Postum that I cannot recommend it too
highly wherever I go. Wishing you
great success, yours truly," Rev. A. P.
Moore, 474 Rhode Island st., Buffalo,
N. Y.
The reason Postum builds up the hu-
man body to a prime condition of
health is that when coffee 1 is left off the
drug effects of the poison disappear and
the elements in Postum unite with albu-
men of the food to make gray matter
and refill the delicate nerve centers all
over the body and in the brain. This
sets up a perfect condition of nerve
health, and the result is that the entire
body feels the effect of it

YOKOHAMA. May 19.â The prevailing
anxiety in international matters is just
now turned away from Korea and Russia
and is centering upon the Pacific Coast of
America, the anti-Japanese feeling there
engendered owing to the recent great in
flux of the islanders occasioning much
press comment. The situation as to Brit
ish Columbia excites comparatively little
alarm, as it is believed that the Govern
ment there will maintain its strong stand
against any restrictive measures. But
much fear is felt lest the supposed exi
gencies of the coming election in the
United States will lead to hostile action in
the way of putting an embargo upon the
entrance of Orientals generally. It is need
less to say that any measure which would
class the Japanese with the Chinese would
deal the severest possible blow at the
friendly relations which have always ex
isted between Japan and the United
States, and would seriously imperil the
now rapidly increasing commercial inter
ests so important to both countries. Not
only is it a fact that the Japanese are
almost as different from the Chinese as
are Americans from the Turks, but also
there is scarcely any point upon which
this exceedingly self-respectful people are
so sensitive as they are upon the persist
ent Ignorance of the West in the matter
of such distinction. Should they now be
lumped with the Chinese by any official
action of the United States, the result
would be disastrous in the extreme, and
it would be many .years before the exist
ing cordial relations could be restored. It
may be said, also, with perfect truth that
there is no real cause for alarm, even
on the part of the Pacific Coast States.
The present influx of JaDanese is a merely
temporal and abnormal increase of the or

pressing- with much vigor. In the great
industrial development of the empire, and
in the opening of Its mines and various
other resources there Is practically no
problem of surplus population. Any re
strictive measures on the part of America
just now would therefore not only be
unwise, but entirely unnecessary.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, May 23.â The changes In
the legal .status of the labor conditions
on June 14 have caused plantation man
agers to take initiative action to protect
themselves against inimical organizations
and Japanese strikes.
The example of the planters of. Maul
and Hawaii have now been followed by
the Planters' Association, which has ap
pointed a committee, consisting of W. M.
Gifford James B. Caske and F. A. Schaef
er, to facilitate the co-operation of labor
supply stations on the different planta
tions. A general labor convention will be
held on June 4, when delegates to a labor
conference, to meet when necessary, will
be elected.
The Japanese have been misbehaving
themselves considerably of late on several
of the plantations, and it is very evident
that they have disaffected leaders behind
them. It is anticipated that difficulties
may to a great extent be removed by the
new labor organizations as outlined. It is
also thought that the conditions and
wages of the laborers may be improved,
either by co-operation or otherwise.
The Republican convention commences
its sessions to-morrow. Quite a propor
tion of Its delegates are native Hawaiians.
Alexander Carlsholm, a native of Nova
Scotia, aged 56 years, died unexpectedly
on the 25th at the Queen's Hospital, after
having suffered about six days with mala
ria. A post mortem revealed the fact that
he had a swelling under one of his arms.
The gland was cut out and is now being
examined by the bacteriologist for plague
bacilli. Xot wishing to take any chances,
the Board of Health decided to cremate
the body.
Two more quarantine stations will be es
tablished at Hawaiian ports as soon as the
new laws go into effect, and the local gov
ernment will be thoroughly relieved of the
task of sending- a physician out to board
all incoming vessels. The new stations
will be at Hilo and Kahului.
6n account of the failure of the Marl
posa's engineer to obey the signals sent
to him from the bridge on the 25th as the
steamer was leaving the Oceanic dock she
backed Into a navy scow that was lying
at the railroad wharf. The accident was
witnessed and the crash was heard by a
large crowd on shore, and It was thought
at first that the rudder or propeller must
have been injured, but on investigation
the Mariposa was found tÂ« be uninjured
and proceeded on her journey. The scow
was badly broken.
An explosion of thirty cases of dynamite,
supposed to have been caused by an incen
diary fire kindled by a vengeful Japanese,
caused the death of a Japanese named
Yda> about two miles from Hilo on the
24th. He was blown to pieces and the
house in which the exp.oslve was stored
disappeared altogether, leaving only a
hole in the ground. Okamoto. another
Japanese, was arrested on suspicion of
having committed the crime, and on the
25th he hanged himself in his cell.
Believed That Conditions and "Wages
of Laborers May Be Greatly
Improved by Co-
Planters Organizing to Pro
tect'Themselves Against
Inimical Societies.

TIE dramatic suicide of Emll D.
Rosenbaum, the young man about
town who burned the candle at
both ends, who made countless
nights merry in revehry with gay
companions, who played the races at
pleasure with no thought or concern of
results, and who ended his life as reck
lessly as he enjoyed it, has created more
than ordinary gossip among those who are
familiar with the tragic.and pass good fel
lows down the line as fast as they, appear.
That there was nothing in the immedia
ate necessities of the dead man to war
rant him in taking his own life there is
no question. The mystery which at first
surrounded his financial affairs has been
cleared away, and while it is true that
extravagance had subjected him to tem
porary embarrassment, he was not des
perately in need of funds and in a very
short time he could have met the few
obligations upon him arid s could have re
turned to the enjoyment of his enormous
Income of $2500 or $3000 a mpnth. While
he had been extravagant to the last ex
cess In many matters he had not dissi
pated his fortune, inherited from his
father, and he leaves an estate variously
estimated at between $200,000 and $400,000.
His Fortune Willed to His Wife.
In a will recently made the suicide had
bequeathed practically all of his' property
to his wife. And now, quickly following
upon his death, comes the announcement
that some of his blood relatives intend to
contest this will on the ground that it was
made while Rosenbaum , was not in his
right mind and did not realize the serious
ness of what he was doing. His friends
and some of his relatives declare that he
Buffered from a malady which unbalanced
his mind and not only led him to the exe
cution of his will, but to the
act which closed his life. This phase: of
the affair promises to result in some sen
sational developments. . i
Rosenbaum led for years a singularly
reckless life. His excesses ultimately un
dermined hiÂ« health to such an extent that
he became an almost dally sufferer from
pain. He sought relief in many places,
the. first and that the vast bulk of the
suicide's property will go to his wife.
'* No Cause for Suicide.
1 It is thus perfectly evident that there
Â£3!L a Â£? Â°ii? tel 7 n f tnl ne in the financial af

union apparently was a love match and

over the husband, who before the matri

.The relatives of Rosenbaum are deeDlv
shocked over his desperate end and thev
do not; feel free 'yet to discuss their ac
tion, in connection with the disposition of
his estate. There is an inclination, how
ever, to contest any will which may be
made In favor of the wife, on the ground
that the suicide was no more in a normal
mental Â¦ condition when he â¢; made it than
he was when, haunted by the phantom
of imaginary fears, he took his own life
but in vain. "When he married he modified
his extravagances of life in large measure,
but did not altogether cease them. He
was one of the heirs to the estate of his
father, which Is valued at several millions
of dollars. Â¦ This estate has never been di
vided among the heirs, but has been ad
ministered as a family property. From it
the suicide drew a monthly income aver
aging between $2500 and $3000.
The principal in no instance has been
touched, and under the terms of the dead
man's will the share of the suicide will be
inherited by his wife.
Heavy Losses at Tanforan.
Upon, his 'enormous monthly income
Emll Rosenbaum lived. He spent money
with a lavish hand. He was one of the
lights which attract the harpies of the
tenderloin. He traveled much and found
in change excitement and new escapades.
He was a frequent visitor .to the race
course, and not long since he begged one
of his friends to say nothing to his broth
ers that he had been seen returning from
Tanforan. They did not approve, he said,
of the manner in which he spent his
money, and his friends knew that he had
lost at Tanforan what would have been
to others a fortune/-
After his marriage Rosenbaum lived a
far more moderate life than before. He
spent his days almost continuously in the
company of his wife. * As far as the out
side world was informed' or concerned
husband and wife were happy. Not long
since Rosenbaum decided to make his will.
Ho had spent nothing but his income and
was the : possessor : of a- great property.
His wife was about to go East, It was
said, to negotiate , the purchase of some,
automobiles, Â¦ and the husband I decided
that they both should make their will3.
Mrs Rosenbaum, who had been Miss
Sadie 8. Magulre, possessed considerable
property, a great deal ; of, which had been
given to her by her husband. - Â¦
The husband had his way, and in a will
bequeathed everything he possessed to his
wife. Mrs. Rosenbaum in her turn made
her last testament'and willed all she pos
sessed to her husband. - The 6 wife then
went East. .Later Rosenbaum went to his
attorneys and revoked the will he had
made, substituting for it another, which
is still under seal. The attorneys say that
they have every reason to believe that the
second and last will of Rosenbaum,' ex
cept in minor particulars, : is the same as

Thomas Burns, member of the examining
board announced yesterday afternoon
that the Sub-Treasurer had not yet made
a selection â from the three highest, but
might do so to-day.
One of the candidates at the examina

had found the questions so simple and so
easily answered. "I don't see why they
give any examination at all," he said.
"It's just a snap."
The returns i=how that he barely man

eligibles.

der is that he did not run amuck and

Herman Rosenbaum evidently has an
Interesting history, but his acquaintances
know little of it. He Is a German by
birth, and about 33 years old. He claims
to come of a wealthy and influential fam
ily in Germany. Two years ago he made
his first appearance here, coming from
South Africa, where, during a residence
of ten years, he made and lost a fortune.
After a brief stay here he went to the
Klondike, but came back a few months
later as poor as when he went there. For
some time he was employetf'as bookkeeper
by Hunt Bros., at 6 California street, but
he was sick so much of the time with
nervous trouble that his services were
not very satisfactory. He also kept books
for the Continental Livery Stables.
Last night Rosenbaum was reported to
be resting easily, but the doctors were
unable to even make a guess at hia
chances for recovery.
HERMAN ROSENBAUM, expert ac
countant and mining promoter,
made a dramatic attempt to take
his own life in room 704 of the
Claus Spreckels building yesterday after
noon. A mind deranged from business
trouble and a love for a young- woman,
which he could not hope to have requited,
were the causes for the act.
It was at a meeting of the board of
directors of the Zacoualpa Rubber Planta
tion Company, of which he has been a
member during the last eight months, that
Rosenbaum made the attempt on his life.
He shot himself through the right lung
with a 3S-caliber revolver, the ball lodg
ing under the skin in the back, from
which 'place it was cut by Dr. â¢ Bunnell
at the Receiving Hospital. Rosenbaum's
chances of recovery are small.
The motive for the shooiing, according
to a statement made by Rosenbaum after
ward, was that he was dropped from the
board of directors of the rubber company,
of which he was the promoter, and thus
ruined financially. Back of that, how
ever, appears a woman, Miss Emma Noel,
secretary of the company, who resides
with her aged mother at the Ashworth
House. 420 Mason street. Rosenbaum be
came infatuated with the girl, and al
though, so far as can be learned, he made
no advances toward her he told mutual
friends that he intended to kill Miss Noel
and himself. He purchased the pistol he
used yesterday with that avowed inten
tion. Six weeks ago Miss Noel appealed
to the police for protection, and Detective
Tom Gibson hunted Rosenbaum up and
gave him such a talking to that he ha3
not since molested Miss Noel. Gibson be
came convinced that the man was insane
and had contemplated taking him before
the Insanity Commission if he again
troubled Miss Noel.
The attempted suicide was a dramatic
affair. Rosenbaum had met, as usual,
Â¦with the directors. Those present were
J. W. Butler. James Newlands, Louis J.
Janes and L. Abbott. Since the last
meeting previous Rosenbaum had sold 175
shares of stock, leaving in his possession
but fifty shares. This fact, together with
the fact that Rosenbaum had acted on
several occasions in a way to leave no
doubt in the minds of his associates that
he was insane, led them to drop him from
the board. When the vote was taken
Rosenbaum became greatly excited and
hastily' left the room. Fifteen minutes
later he again 1 .burst into the room,
where the directors, having finished their
business, were telling stories and smok
ing. Striking a dramatic pose at the head
of the table, the deposed director glanced
wildly about him and exclaimed:
"Gentleman, you have ruined my life."
Instantly after uttering the words he
drew his pistol and sent the bullet crash
ing through his body. He sank to the
floor with a cry of distress.
A surgeon in the building was sum
moned, and President Butler telephoned
for the ambulance and a surgeon from
the Receiving Hospital. Dr. Bunnell ac
companied the ambulance. After a hasty
examination of the wound he directed
the removal of 'the wounded man to the
hospital, where the ball was cut out and
he was made as comfortable as possible.
Rosenbaum never lost consciousness, and
half an hour after his arrival at the hos
pital could talk quite easily. He made
the following statement:
"It was through Miss Noel that I was
induced to sell 200 of my shares to New
lands. Butler influenced her against me,
ati d she gave me the cold shoulder, telling
me she had a good salary now and didn't
need me. Since the detective saw me 1
have not spoken to her, although I had
seen her in the office when I called. When
I threatened to shoot her six weeks ago
I told her I had done everything I could
for her, and now that I was poor she
wanted to cast me off. At the annual
meeting to-day of the company they did
not elect me as a director. I felt that I
had lost everything, and after the meet
ing I went and got my revolver. I re
turned to the office and walked into the
room where they were all seated. I told
them they had ruined my life, and
shot myself. Butler, Newlands, Janes
Abbott and Miss Noel were there. 1
should have got $2500 as a commission for
selling the plantation, but I did not get a
cent. What is the use of living when you
are out in the cold, cold world?"
President J. W. Butler says that Itosen-

baum was treated fairly by his business
associates and had no reason for com
plaint.
"This man came to me about two
months ago with O. H. Harrison, a resi
dent of Mexico, who wanted to organize
a company to carry on the La Zacualpa
rubber plantation. The company was duly
organized, and for his . work in pro
moting Rosenbaum was given 225 shares
and was made a director of the company.
He expressed himself as well pleased with
the arrangement. Since then he has driven
us no end of trouble by his insane actions.
He sold 175 shares of his stock, but that
was his own private affair, and I know
nothing personally of the deal except that
it was fair.
"The matter of Rosenbaum's persecu
tion of Miss Noel was reported to thÂ«
Chief by some of the young lady's
friends," said Detective Gibson last night,
"and I was detailed to Investigate. I found
in Miss Noel a hardworking young woman
of 24, whose life was devoted to the sup
port of an aged mother, with whom she
spent all her time when not at work.
Mother and daughter told me that they
became acquainted with Rosenbaum about
fifteen months ago. when Miss Noel was
employed by him in the capacity of sten
ographer. He was sick a great deal and
sometimes out of funds. Mrs. Noel took
pity on him, and not only attended him
when he was 'sick on several occasions,
but two or three times loaned him money.
"Miss Noel told me and I believe that
Rosenbaum never made love to her or
spoke on the subject of marriage. She
was consequently greatly annoyed when
she heard from some of the men- in the
office that he talked of being in love with
her and had said that he would kill her.
This sort of thing had been going on for
several months when I was called Into
the case. ,
"It seems that -about six weeks ago
Rosenbaum purchased a revolver and ex
hibited it. to friends of Miss Noel, boast
ing that he would kill her and himself
Things came to a climax when, during
her absence from the office one day,
Rosenbaum put a card under the door ad
dressed to Miss Noel notifying her that he
Intended to kill her/
"When I found Rosenbaum In his lodg
ings, at 405 Geary street, and told him
who I was he became greatly excited and
sprang to the closet to get his revolver.
I blocked his way and then he said he
only wanted to show me that the weapon
was not loaded. I permitted him to get
it and found that it was empty. But he
boasted that he had bought it to kill Miss
Noel and himself. 'It is the will of God
that I kill her,' he said, 'and how can you
prevent me. Even if you were with her
I could shoot her quickly and then kill
myself before you could interfere."
"I often accompanied Miss Noel to her
office. Once Rosenbaum was waiting at
the entrance of the building, behind a
column. When he saw me he ran.
"It is my personal opinion that Miss
>.oel is a hard-working, honest girl, and
that her story concerning her relations
with Rosenbaum is straight. Rosen
baum acted and talked like a crazy man
every time I saw him, and the only won-
