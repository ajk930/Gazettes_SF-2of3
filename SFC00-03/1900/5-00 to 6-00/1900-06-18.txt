Colonel Quay announced himself as for
Roosevelt because of his confidence that
the Governor's name would assure the
success of the Republican ticket, but there
are those â and they are not enemies of
the Colonel â who announce the belief that
his position is the result of antagonism
on his part to Senator Hanna. chairman
of the National Committee. It was said
that Quay still remembered that the Ohio
Senator had used his influence against,

PHILADELPHIA. June 17.â The atten
tion both of delegates and other visiting
politicians to-day was concentrated upon
the movement In the Interest of Governor
Roosevelt as a Vice Presidential candi
date. The Pennsylvania delegation met
early In the day and it was announced
that the State delegation had taken a
positive position for the Governor for
second place on the ticket. The an
nouncement was soon followed by the
statement, which was made upon excel
lent authority.' that Colonel Quay and
Senator Platt and others In sympathy
with them held a conference last night
and had decided upon a plan of campaign
which was intended to bring Roosevelt
to the front as a candluate. stampede the
convention for h!ra and force his accept
ance of the nomination.
Platt and Qnay Would Force

the Rongh Rider.
BOOMING ROOSEVELT.
"I do not know wha.i Pennsylvania win
do. as all of tbe delegates have not yet
arrived here. I have looked over tne sit
uation and find there Is nothing els* in
view except the election of McKinley. 1
The Pennsylvania delegation will meet
tomorrow at 3 o'clock, when It is under
stood a resolation will be adopted declar
ing in favor of Roosevelt. It la stated
there are at least fifty-eight of the six
four delegates from this State who will
be for Roosevelt.
Colonel Quay this afternoon save an in
terview In which he said:.
Upon this assurance Mr. Bliss' friends
went forth with renewed couraga. They
accepted this declaration as a posltiv*
willingness to enter the contest and they
lost no time in letting tne fact be known.
"I don't want to jay that I will not
accept before the tender Is made, for
that would be premature." he said, "but
I do say for the hundredth time that I
hope the light man will be found for tnÂ»
place and I will not be asked to serve.
On the other hand." he added, after no
little entreaty. "I will not say that If
nominated I would decline. I know of no
American who has ever declined 90 hlgn
an office, and I shall not say that I would
do so."
mit the truth of these statements, say*
ing there were broader reasons for nomi
nating Roosevelt. It was asserted by
those in a position to know that Roose
velt's "acceptance In case of his. nomina
tion was assured, but this was not put
upon stronger ground than that Senator
Platt had given his assurances. There
can be no doubt, however, regardless of
Roosevelt's own position, that he Is to
be the Platt-Quay candidate, and they
feel safe In the confidence that he will
not decline the office If It be forced upon
him.
The development In Mr. Roosevelt's be
half had the effect of bringing former
Secretary Bliss conspicuously forward as
the opposing candidate, and the fact was
announced late In the afternoon by those
very clcse to him that he would accept
If nominated. From the first Senator
Hanna and his followers have advocated
the nomination of either Bliss or Allison.
The latter has made his own declination
absolutely unequivocal, thus forcing Blisa
to the front despite his own declination
to accept the position, tie repeated to
day hi3 desire to be relieved of the re
sponsibility, but his friends left him with
the knowledge that if the nomination
should be tendered it would not be de
clined.
- Little booms speedily became submerged and big booms drifted without a helmsman* on 'the
rising Roosevelt flood. California's delegation dropped the Scott boom before they dropped their
gripsacks and declared that they had been pledged, to Trying M. Scott, without their knowledge.
Maryland swung into line with -almost a solid, delegation 1 . The Rough Rider country came;; to
the front with broad-brimmed sombreros' and cowboy j-ells. Montana, .Arizona and New Mexico
Instantly the air became filled with Roosevelt talk. Singularly enough it was not regarded
as a move against Hanna. Men close to the administration took it up. Hanna, who had said
that the convention should have the picking of McKinley's mate, provided it took a national man,
was taken at his word. State after State began to fall into line. Connecticut, that had been
languidly supporting Secretary Long, expressed a decided preference for Roosevelt. Colorado,
under the leadership of Senator Wolcott, himself a Vice Presidential candidate, was pledged.
Arkansas and Alabama wheeled into line. Senator Lodge, the Long leader in New England,
said, that if Roosevelt would take it Long's name would not be presented and the solid vote of
New England would-be assured. Joseph H< Manley of Maine called on the Governor and pledged
him the good will of the Pine Tree State.
This inquiry was prompted by the stories in the Philadelphia papers for several days to
the effect that Quay of Pennsylvania, Jamieson of Indiana arid Platt of New York were planning
to control the convention against McKinley and Hanna. It was speedily understood that Quay
had executed one of those brilliant strokes for which he is famous and had seized on the popular
ity of New York's Governor and the popular demand for him as a candidate for Vice President to
emerge from his seclusion as a defeated claimant for a seat in the Senate and become a factor in the
convention. . â¢
"Have they indorsed Roosevelt for President or Vice President?"
What may not inaptly be termed a Roosevelt deluge has been sweeping down on the con
vention town. It has come from no particular quarter; it has come from everywhere. So far as it
can be located it started in Oregon, the National Committeeman of which State declared for
Roosevelt last Thursday. 'But it did not break with actual violence until this forenoon, when the
Pennsylvania followers of Senator Quay announced that of the sixty-four votes from the Keystone
State fifty-eight would be cast for Roosevelt, and that this had been determined at a caucus held in
the house of Senator Grady, where Quay is making his home.
When this news got abroad at the hotel where the Governor, Senator Hanna and Senator
Platt are stopping, nearly everybody asked:
HEADQUARTERS, HOTEL WALTON, PHILADELPHIA, June 17.â Roose-
Mv velt's name is written beside McKinley's on the Republican sky in letters of fire. The.Gov
' ernor of New York will be nominated for Vice President if he will accept â and hens likely
to accept.
That Roosevelt cheer when the New York delegation came to the city last night â the first
and only one heard here since the town took on gala attire â was prophetic. Since then no one
has had time to cheer. Nearly everybody has been trying to make the Governor run for Vice
President and the remainder have been seeking to keep the other booms for Vice President from
being carried away from their moorings.

PHILADELPHIA. June 17 -With the
Republican National Convention forty
Â«ight hours away. Philadelphia to-Â«iay
resembled a convention city ' about as
much as an ordinary town meeting re
eercbles a riot. Usually with a national
convention so near at hand, the hotel cor
ridors are choked with people, marching
clubs are parading the streets, the air
Is filled with the blare of bands, pensa
tional rumors are everywhere, and the
<*in and confusion are terrific. To-day
tfce <;uiet of Philadelphia was unbroken
by a single cheer or a strain of music.
The weather was responsible for much of
It. Jupiter Pluvlus did his worst. The
rain god simply would not be propitiated.
All right he drenched the city, until It
seemed that his reservoirs must run dry;
but the supply held out nearly aJl 0*y.
Toward night he showed signs of weari
ness, and the heavens continued to ooze
and drip as though the last drop of mois

The flajrs and bur.ting with which the
hotels, clubs, stores and houses had been
elaborately decorated, hung wet. limp
and lifeless, and the delegates and s visit
ors â¢wandrrod aimlessly through the slip
pery struts. So heavy and dispiriting was
the gloom that the electric lights were
turned on in the hotels, but even their
glare could not dispel the depression.
Add to the influence of tb? weather the
fact that the rules of a Quaker Sabbath
are enforced h*Â»re. and tho p!c:uro Is com

have produced some cheer, but Philadel

A king's ransom could procure nothing
more exhilarating than lemonade, and
lemonade has no power to fortify the

return from a trip to the Transvaal. In
order that he might better express his

Chicago to-day on his way to the Phila

adopted by the convention.
"I shall so before the "committee on

endeavor to secure the adoption of my
resolutions in the committee. If I am not
successful I rill avail myself of a proxy
of one of the delegates and go on the
floor of the convention anu make a fight.
I am determined to place the convention

Special Dispatch to The CalL
A#EW YORK, June 17.â The World has the following from Philadelphia:
M M Governor Roosevelt said at midnight:
"I still believe that I will not be nominated. The New York dele
gation will not present my name. I control that situation. I cannot tell
what other States may do.
"I am but human. To decline would be to ruin my political career. I
have fought against this as long as I can. The party seems to want me. No
sane man commits suicide.
"What I have said heretofore has been said in good faith. I have no
desire to cheapen the Vice Presidency. It is a great office. Under such
pressure I cannot decline. I am tired of repeating my declaration that I am
not a candidate. I am greatly impressed by the sincerity of the movement
to nominate me for the Vice Presidency. I may be compelled to make my
first retreat."
It is accepted by the leaders that. Roosevelt aas sincere in his emphatic
declarations that he would not accept and was not a candidate, but he now
realizes that the popular and political movement to force the nomination
upon him has reached a point beyond his control.
The attitude of the administration â especially that of Senator Hanna,
who has been looked to by the delegates to give the cue to the wishes of the
President â forms an interesting feature of the situation as developed to-day.
It has been the general impression that it only remained for Hanna to give
the word or for some person with authority to indicate the wishes of the
President and that the convention will line 'ip for the man selected.
While the situation is not beyond the control of the administration
forces to prevent the nomination of Roosevelt, it. is realized that such ac
tion, in view of the general stampede, would be unwise. From the first
Senator Hanna has declared that the convention should make the nomina
tion, and now that it is about to do so. even under the manipulation and with
the assistance of such experienced politicians as Platt and Quay, it would
be impolitic for Senator Hanna to make a fight to defeat it, even if the man
selected is not the selection of the administration. The only man in the race
who seemed satisfactory to the friends of the administration was Secretary
Lor.g. and his candidacy did not flourish because a Massachusetts candidate
did iiot impress the delegates as giving additional strength to the ticket.
With doubt as to the choice of the administration and,' with the desire tb
make New York safe, with a belief, among many delegates that Roosevelt
was the one man who would add strength to the ticket east and West, it
was not difficult to start the 5tampede. and_to-night it is generally accepted
that the rational Republican ticket will be '"McKinley and Roosevelt."
"I Am But Human/' Is His Dec
laration, "and to Decline Would
Ruin My Political Career. No
Sane Man Commits Suicide."
Practical Admission on the Part of
the Empire State Executive That
He Will Accept Second Place
on the National Ticket.
June 17.â For the first time since the Republican
./Â¦^leaders began to assemble in Philadelphia there has to-day been some
earnest work upon the platform, and a draft has been made which it i3
believed will receive the approval of the convention. This document pre
pared in part before coming to Philadelphia by Postmaster General Smith,
and it is understood that it was submitted to the President for his inspec
tion and approval before Mr. Smith left Washington. Mr. Smith was in con
sultation during the greater part oj the afternoon with Senator Foraker,
who. it is understood, will be chairman of the committee on resolutions.
The Senator has himself given considerable attention to the preparation of
the declaration of principle*, and he added considerably to Mr. Smith s
The instrument as so far prepared is of considerable length, but very
clear cut and emphatic in its enunciations. It begins by calling attention to
the promises that were made in the St. Louis convention of 1S96. and,
after enumerating them, declares that faith h^s been kept in almost every in
stance, as is shown by the statutes which the last Congress added to the laws
of the country. Especial attention is called to the fact that the platfrom
of 1896 promised that the country should be put upon a gold standard, and
that this pledge has been faithfully maintained. There is a clear and dis
tinct declaration for the maintenance of this standard, and the resolutions,
as so far prepared, make no reference to bimetallism. The resolutions also
contain the usual declaration for a protective tariff. ...
The President's policy with reference to the Philippines is indorsed
throughout and his conduct of the '.var with Spain is upheld in the strong
est terms of commendation and praise. The President's course in the
Boer-British entanglement also is indorsed, and attention is called to the
fact that under his guidance the United States has been the only nation to
offer intervention between Â»he warring nations. The President also comes
'in for prau-e because of his attitude in The Hague Peace Conference, and
the .idmrnrstrati6n"is"particu!arly"'commended: for its position and its'ac
complishment in the matter of an open door in China.
The legislation toward which attention is especially directed as having
been accomplished in accordance with the party pledges, in addition to that
concerning the finances, includes the Dingley tariff law. the annexation of
Hawaii and the liberation of Cuba from Spanish domination. The country
is also felicitated upon the acquisition of Porto Rico.
The plank on the Philippines is practically in the language of the Presi
dent's message, promising the restoration of order and the establishment of
authority in the islands and the granting of local self-government sq soon as
the Filipinos show that they are prepared for it. On the question of
trusts the platform recognizes the right of capital to combine for industrial
purposes, but condemns all conspiracies in restraint of trade and the limita
tion of prices. ;
There will be a declaration for an isthmian canal, rather than for a canal
via the Nicaragua route specifically, pending the report of the commission ap
pointed to investigate. ....
A promise will be made to redeem the promise to establish independence
in Cuba as speedily as practicable^ and demand will be made for the condign
punishment of crimes committed by American officials in Cuba. _
Legislation for the restoration of the merchant marine will be indorsed.
There is a proposition to at least express the hope with reference to
China that that empire shall not be dismembered. A demand will be made
for the protection of American missionaries and other Americans in China.
H. H. Hanna, who is credited with the authorship of the gold standard
bill, was in conference with Messrs. Smith and. Foraker for some time to
day with reference to the financial plank of the platform. He is especially
anxious that this plank should be unequivocal in its language, and that no
concessions should be made to the silverites. The representatives from the
Western States are antagonizing him somewhat on this subject, but Mr.
Hanna expresses confidence that no concession will be made.

through one of the severest hail, wind and
rain storms which railway men say they
ever encountered. The train ran into the
storm between Falls City and Rulo, Neb.,
forty miles west of St. Joseph, Mo. The
railroad men say that ar times it seemed
as if the cars would be lifted from the
tracks. The storm struck the train In an

threw open the throttle in the hopes of
running away from it.
The train was filled with people and in
the cars there was great excitement. With

In with Dolliver cheers on their lips and
at once began to say that they would sup
port Roosevelt with joy If there was any
prospect of his accepting the nomination.
Illinois, with forty-eight delegates and 300
Dolllver shouters from Chicago, appeared
late in the afternoon. They took in the
situation in an instant and will be cheer
ing for Roosevelt In the morning.
So It came to pass that in one short,
day the situation that was scattered
among a score of candidates, some of
them put up for tactical purposes, and
all open to some objection, became cen
tered around one man who, not once nor
twice, but a hundred times, had declared
that he did not want the nomination and
would not take it.
Â¦ To two men this uprising came as a sur
prise. One of these was Senator Hanna.
The other was Governor Roosevelt. Sen
ator Hanna said on Friday:
"Roosevelt will not be nominated. I will
protect him from a stampede."
He said yesterday:
"It won't be Roosevelt, because he don't
want It."
To-day he said practically nothing and
to-night he is dining at the house of Clem
ent A. Griscom with a party of Cabinet
officers and Senators and is apparently let
ting the Roosevelt boom run its course.
Governor Roosevelt came here speedily
to discover that he had entirely under
estimated the sentiment of the country
regarding himself. Seeing what was com
ing on him, he hurried early in the day
to Senator Platfs room for consultation.
Senator Platt, crippled with a broken rib,
and suffering intense pain, threw his doors
open and remained subject to the Gov
ernor's claims all day long. With the
Governor were Senator I-odge of Massa
chusetts, and Chairman Odell, at the Gov
ernor's request, was called in. Later Fred
crick S. Glbbs, New York's National Com
mlttfeman. T.t-muei^K. Quigg. president of
the New VÂ«rk County Committee, and
Frank S. Platt, were called in. Still later
William J. Young, the secretary to the
Governor, Joined the party. There was a
long talk. The Governor confessed that
he had not judged the sentiment of the
country aright and had not understood
the position in which he was likely to
find himself. He was much â¢ distressed.
He declared that the position was dis
tasteful to him and that the only am
bition he had was to be Governor again.
He also took occasion to say that he was
convinced that his friends in New York
had been loyal In . respecting his wishes
and remarked that any one must be in
sane to suppose that such a movement
had been manufactured. .
The question to be settled was, "What
was the Governor to do?'.' Senators Platt
and Lodge and Messrs. Odell, Gibbs and
Quigg told him that this, was a question
that he. must answer for himself. At the
same time they told him that there was
a tremendous energy behind the demand
that he go on the ticket with McKinley.
This sentiment was a tribute to his char
acter not only as a soldier but as an of
ficial of city. State and nation. It was a
recognition of his services as a, citizen
and he must settle with himself whethei
â¢he would spurn what almost every other
man in the United States would consider
as a prize.
While he was listening to this the Gov
ernor sat straight as a ramrod in his
chair, with his arms folded and his Jaw
set. He was not disposed to recede from
his position. Presently he began to waver
and again appealed for advice.
Senator Hanna, who had been in a con
ference on the national platform, went
to Senator Plan's room and was admit,
ted to the conference. He soon saw how
the matter was drifting, but did not ex
press an opinion one way or the other.
The conference broke up and Governor
Roosevelt and Senator Lodge took Secre
tary of War Root to luncheon at th%
Philadelphia Club. There occurred more
talk about the question distressing th*
Governor.
Senator Hanna remained with Senator
Platt and they had a discussion about
the relative merits of Mr. Bliss and Gov
ernor . Roosevelt as candidates. It was
conciliatory on both sides, and when they
separated Senator Platt was for Roose
velt if he would take It and Senator
Hanna was still hoping for Mr. Blisa'
nomination.
.Governor Roosevelt returned to his room
In the Walton after luncheon and Senator
Lodge reported to Senator Platt. He said
the Governor seemed to be wavering.
Senator Piatt frankly said he hoped for
the sake of the party at large that the
Governor could see his way clear to run,
but he would not urge him.
Then another consultation followed, this
time In the Governor's room, and it was
attended j by Senator Lodge. Secretary
Root. General Frank V. Greene of New
.York and Senator Penrose of . Pennsyl
vania. The Governor saw the newspaper
men late in the afternoon. .'.' i;
"How about that. declination?" asked a
cheeky Washington correspondent.
' "I have not a word to say."
"But you are as good , as nominated
now." some one said.
"I know nothing about it," replied the
Governor. .
"Is it true that you said that If nomi
nated you would rise In your seat In the
convention hall and decline?"
"It is a He." said the Governor.
The Governor also told Woodruff that,
while he would probably consent to*" be
nominated, yet Senator Platt would force
Senator Hanna to choose between him and
Woodruff. Hanna, the Governor explain
ed to Woodruff, was opposed to both of
them..: The Governor also advised Mr.
Woodruff not to withdraw, but to bring
his delegation of 1200 to the city. Mr.
Woodruff had contemplated telegraphing
them to remain at home.
Senator P!att and State Chairman Odell
declared during the evenlntr that Governor
Roosevelt would accept. the nomination If
it were tendered to him.
AH evening his room was besiegred by
his admirers, many urging .him to accept.
The Governor's manner indicated that in
his own mind, at least, he had yielded,
and his nomination came to be regarded
as a foregone conclusion.

the citizens of Ukiah and vicinity and
the universal verdict is that the state
ments were correct. All parties here con
demn the aged superintendent of the llen
docino Hospital and express a desire for
his immediate removal. The facts are
known to many people here ariM they have
onlv needed an expose in order Â¦ to de
clare their own knowledge of the actions
of Dr. King and the political intrigues of
his secretary, Mr. Handy, who, it is con
ceded by all parties, is really the super
intendent and is prostituting the asylum
and its management to "his political ends
and purposes.
Steward Jones, who was removed on
Friday last, has refused to surrender his
keys or the rooms he and his family oc
cupy in the asylum building, and the aged
superintendent has Instructed the carpen
ter to change the locks on all the doors
and by this means debar Jones and his
family from occupying the quarters a>
'signed them by the management of the
asylum. Steward Jones will not vacate
unless forcibly ejected, and it is said he
will resist force with force.
The excitement is still at a fever heat
and public opinion is all on the side oi
the deposed employes. The people here
have confidence in the board of manag
er? regulating affairs and deciding the
case of the deposed men on the merits of
their cases.
James George, the chief carpenter, who
was removed, has been superseded by a
man named by Secretary Handy, and it
is rumored that Handy is to dictate his
own successor as secretary to the aged
superintendent in case the board should
sustain him in his removal of Jones as
steward.
It is rumored that Dr. King has de
cided on the removal of Dr. L. A. ulster,
the first assistant physician. Supervisor
Moseley and about six other employes.
The entire -working force of the institu
tion is in a very unsettled state, not
knowing at what hour Mr. Handy and the

heads.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 17.â The
steamer Alpha arrived direct from Cape,
Nome at 7 o'clock to-night, after one of
the most eventful and yet one of the luck
iest trips on record.
A dozen times. Captain Buckholtz says,
he would not have given six bits for the
chances of the boat or her passengers. Yet
she came back after traversing WOO miles,
with over a thousand of that through ice
floes, without a single acqident, nor ao
much as the breaking of a yard rope.
The Alpha brought five passengers who
had about $300,000 on board. The passen
gers were Glen Tinsley of Dawson. with
525,000; Jack Kill, Seattle, representing
partially Krye, Bruhn & Co., fliz.wr,
Frank Green. Dawson and Nome, $S0.0O0;
J. C. Monaghan, Denver, Colo., with *S0,
000. The fitth passenger was Oscar Gou
dell, a Swede, who went north by the
Alpha and was nearly fatally poisoned by
mercury on the way.
Purser Shoup had the amounts men
tioned in his safe. The passengers will all
leave for Seattle to-morrow morning. The
Alpha landed all her 175 passengers and a
full load of freight at Nome.
She had cleared for St. Michael, but
most people believed when she left here
she would go to Nome, all ner passen
gers being really bound for the Ameri
can gold lielas. Captain Huckholtz says
that the ice was too thick toward St.
Michael and he therefore abandoned go
ing there and went to Cape Nome. Once
there he had no difficulty with the cus
toms authorities, the people giving tne
steamer a roj'al welcome.
Jack Kill was the most interesting pas
senger. He says that No. 21 of Top
cock, a new creek W miles from Nome,
discovered about Christmas, had a very
large clean-up early in' April. In one
week the miners, working only eight
hours a day, took out $li.000 and $55,000
was altogetner taken out of the claim in
a little over a month. Several clean-upa
have been made of J4Q.000 to claims of
ICO feet only In extent. Contrary to gen
eral expectation, the people wtio came
down trom Dawson curing the winter
brought a large amount of money into the
camp. Six weeks before the Alpha ar
rived, all work on the claims was stopped
on account of a cold snap, when the ther
mometer went as low as 70 degrees be
low and the weather for â¢weeks was
frightfully cold. .
Topcock and Golden Gate were the prin
cipal ones of the new discoveries. At Buff
Camp, on Topcock, about 400 men were
working and taking out on the regular
run of claims an average of 2") cents t<*
the pan.
A new townslte of Grantly Point has
been opened ten miles from Nome, and
townslte lots are booming. Business in
Nome is quiet and provisions were very
high when the Alpha arrived. Canned
goods were selling from 50 to 75 cents and
prices were still running upward when
the Alpha appeared and then they went
down with a Hop.
A water service for the town is being
arranged from Moonlight Creek, four
miles away. Several times during the
winter the town had very narrow escapes
from fire. The steamers Alexander.
Thrasher and Jeannette arrived from San
Francisco about the same time as the
Alpha.
The Alpha will load another cargo and
immediately .proceed north again. Her
hull is badly dented by her contact with
the ice. v __
GOLD FROM DAWSON.
Steamer Dirigo Lands Eighty-Fivo
Passengers at Seattle.
SEATTLE. June 17.â The steamer Dir
igo arrived from Lynn Canal this even-
Ing, having on board eighty-five passen
gers, who brought down about $300,000 in
gold dust. The steamer's officers report
160 passengers at Bennett, who were un
able to reach Skaguay in time to catch
the Dlrigo. These, it Is reported at the
Skaguay offices of the steamship com
pany, are bringing out a very large
amount of gold, greater, it is said, than
any party of similar size that has yet
arrived.
The largest owners of pold dust on
board the Dlrigo were the McDonald
brothers, of Seattle. Roily and Donald.
The former has 230 pounds, valued at
$30,000. and the latter 140 pounds, valued
at $30,000. Charles Hutchinson brought out
200 pounds, .valued at $42,000. The balance
of the shipment is owned by the remaining
passengers in sums ranging from J3000 up.
The passengers all declare that this
summer's output from the Klondike will
be much larger than last and estimates
are made all the way from $25,000,000 to
$-10,000,000. As yet they say the clean
up has not started this way. and probably
will not until after July - 1.
The latest advices from the gold-bear
ing- districts remote from Dawson, It Is
said, show that the clean-up is almost
double the amount first reported. Bonanza
Creek alone, it is stated, will send out
$8,000,000 to $10,000,000. which will be thÂ»
largest amount coming from any of the
creeks.
The Dawson banks, it is snid, have tak
en In about $2,000,000 already, and when
the Dlrigo passengers left were buying I
very heavily every day. â¢ [
In the city of Dawson business was very
lively. There was no scarcity of labor
to speak of, although every man who
wanted to was working at good wages.
Food prices were beginning to drop and
the general belief was that before an
other month Seattle prices for ordinary
commodities would prevail.
LONG'S FRIENDS ACTIVE
Claim tbe Solid Vote of New
England for the Secretary
of the Navy.
PHILADELPHIA, June 17.â The Massa
chusetts delegation perfected Its organ
ization to-day, and also took steps to
get into direct telephonic communication
with Secretary Long to ascertain his
wishes concerning the Vice Presidential
situation. This last move was regarded
as rather significant. The delegation is
to a man strongly favorable to the Secre
tary, and Jt was believed that co-opera
tion could be secured with the delega
tions of Maine, Xew Hampshire, Ver
mont, Connecticut and Rhode Island, so
as to secure practically a Folid vote of
the seventy-eight New England dele
gates. So many candidates and possibili
ties were in the air. however, that a com
mittee consisting of Messrs. Shaw, Mur
ray and Rockwell was chosen to ascertain
Mr. Long's wishes as to the presentation
of his name. It was supposed that he
was at Washington and could be reached
by the long-distance telephone, but later
it developed that he was at his summer
home at Hingham, Mass., where it was
hoped to communicate with him later.
The delegation was also divided into com
mittees, which started In to canvass in
behalf of the Long candidacy.
Senator Allison arrived at about noon
and took quarters at the Aldlne Hotel.
He was closeted the greater part of the
day with prominent members of the
party, and late in the afternoon attended
a dinner given by Clement Griscom at his
country place. The Senator announced
before leaving for Mr. Grlscom's place
that he was earnestly supporting the can
didacy of Mr. Dolliver, and that he hoped
to see him nominated. Do!liver*s friends
are still enthusiastic over his chances,
and they claim that nothing but an agree
ment upon some available man by the
members of the New York delegation can
prevent his nomination.
In the event . that the New Yorkers
agree upon Roosevelt or some available
candidate the Iowa men will not press
Dolliver's nomination. They say New
York should have the first call upon tho
nomination if it can decide upon a man.
If it does not agree upon this point, and
the Iowa people do not rate Woodruff, as
an available man, they will push for the
nomination of Dolllver against any and
all candidates. They are confident that
Dolllver will be able to beat Woodruff
before the convention, and will be a
stronger candidate before the people at
large.
if Governor Roosevelt beats him. In fact,
he has assured the Governor that if he
changes his mind and cares to stand for
the nomination he (Woodruff) will with
draw."
There were several rumors to-night that
Roosevelt had at last decided to stand
for the nomination. These rumors prob
ably arose from the fact that he had said
that if his nomination was finally forced
he could not decline it; but he said em
phatically to-night that he would not al
low Mr. Platt to present his name, and
would fight against the nomination to the
last minute.
Toward midnight there was a rumor
that Senator Platt had stated that the
New York delegation would at its meeting
to-morrow night indorse Governor Roose
velt for Vice President. The rumor was
brought to the attention of Governor
Roosevelt, and at the moment it was told
him State Chairman O'Dell entered the
room.
"Mr. O'Dell." said the Governor, "is
there any truth in that statement?"
"Not that I know of," said Mr. O'Dell.
"Mr. Platt made the statement in the
presence of several newspaper men," said
one of the party.
"I understand." said Mr. O'Dell. "that
New York's delegation will not have a
candidate for Vice President. I do not
think there has been any change on the
part of the delegation."
A significant occurrence of the evening
was the appearance on the lapels of the
coats of members of the New York State
delegation of buttons bearing the pictures
of McKinley and Roosevelt. It was looked
upon by the delegates from other States
as a tacit ackrowledgment that while
New York was not forcing the Vice Pres
idency upon Roosevelt the delegates were
willing that the other States should do so.
intend to vote for Governor Roosevelt for
Vice President. The election or defeat of
McKinley is a question of five hundred
millions of dollars to Pennsylvania, and 1
will cast my vote on the Vice Presidency
In the interest of my State to strengthen
McKinley.
â¢I know nothing at all about what is
going to happen in the convention. ThiÂ«
is mcrejy my individual view."
In connection with the movement among
the P*nnF>ivanians to further the nomi
nation of Roosevelt, Attorney General
John H. Elkin. the loader of the Quay
forces in the Stale, said:
"A candidate for the Vice Presidency
should U> nominated who will strengthen
the ticket. The strongest candidate with
the American people to-day is Governor
Roosevelt. He is the best vote-getter by
far of all the gentlemen named for second
"Roosevelt is the idol of the young Re
publicans of the whole country, and as
Governor of New York he has demon
strated lhat he possesses a high order of
executive ability. He is able, progressive,
patriotic and conservative. The Republi
can* of Pennsylvania are a unit for his
nomination. Our delegation will vote for
rim, and 1 have no doubt that he will be
nominated. Colonel Ror revelt is too good
a Republican not to accept the nomination
if his party demands :t. With McKinley
and Roosevelt as our standard bearers
we will ewcep the country in November."
While interest is focused on New York
the delegation from that State looks on
with complacency, the members apparent
ly enjoying the commotion. The situation
in New York may be described in a para
graph: The mass of delegates are for the
nomination of Roosevelt for Vice Presi
dent; Senator Platt is pledged to Governor
Rooprvelt to bÂ«- against his nomination,
and will not break the pledge unless the
Governor zlves his consent.
This much }s known â if the convention
names Governor Roosevelt for Vice Pres.
ldent he will not decline. He has emphat
ically said that he would not accept If
nominated, but it is known on the best of
authority that he will not decline. Never
theleps, his determination to protest
against the nomination until the last min
ute is unchanged. While he admitted to
night that the situation looked as If he
would be forced into a nomination, he was
hoping that such would not be the
case, and was u?ir.g his every effort to
change the ?< ntiment. He said:
"My place is at the head of the ticket
in Xew York State. I feel that Mr. Hanna
is right, and that I can do more to help
Mr. McKinley by running in New York
State than I can by being on the national
ticket."
Lieutenant Governor Woodruff and his
campaign manager, William Berri. both
asserted to-nlRht that the boom for Roose
velt was helping their cause. "If New
York and Hanna stand firm against thÂ«
Roosevelt boom it will be exploded and
Mr. Woodruff will get the nomination,"
said Mr. Cerri.
The real logic of this reasoning is not
quite apparent, but a significant remark
dropped by a lieutenant of Mr. Wood
ruff put the matter in a new light.
"Mr. Woodruff," he said, "does not care

from bitter experience that intelligence

NO utterance made at the recent
Democratic State Convention at

than that of ex-Senator Stephen
M. White Just before the adjournment
of that body. The Call, In accordance
with its steadfast aim to publish the
news, had designed to publish the speech
verbatim, but it reached the . editorial
rooms too late to be given in full the
morning following the convention. Since
adjournment there has been so much in

about it that The Call feels it to be its
duty to reproduce the address. It fol
lows:
"Mr Chairman, the hour is too late and
your occupation is too onerous to Justify

selected by this convention, no Â¦ matter
what his previous views may have been,
who would dare go to that convention and
do otherwise than cast his vote for that
peerless representative of Democracy,
Mr. liryan (applause and cheers), and
there is â¢ a lesson in this demonstra
tion worthy of remembrance. He
sprang into prominence not because
he was sustained or backed by
power or influence, but because he did
his duty fearless of power or temptation,
resolute in the performance of duty and
determined to execute those principles
which he dearly cherished an,d whose
triumph he believed he saw. He met the
enemy and was defeated. X T ndaunted he
egain faced the foe, and from one end of

CONVENTION ADDRESS
OF SENATOR WHITE
HAVANA, June 17.â General Alejandro
Rodriguez, Nationalist, was yesterday
elected Mayor of Havana, polling 13,073
votes against 6034 cast for Senor Estrada
Mora, Independent. The total vote fell
about 4500 below the registration.
The Nationalist party elected its entire
ticket, eighteen Councilmen. the Treasur
er, one. Correctional "Judge and three Mu
nicipal Judges. The other correctional
judgeship fell to an ladependent candi
date, as did also the fourth municipal
judgeship.. Of the six other Councilmen
four are Republicans and two National
ists, who ran Independently.
Reports from every part of the island go
to show that perfect order prevailed at
the polls. Not a shot was fired, nor was
there any sign of disturbance anywhere.
To an American observer of the elec
tion here it seemed as if the people re
garded the whole matter with absolute in
difference. There, was not even a crowd
In waiting to hedr the result declared.
Not a cheer was raised, nor were there
any of the ordinary indications of election
excitement," although a demonstration in
honor of the successful candidates took
place to-night.
The victory of the Nationalists Is chief
ly due to the fact that they were first
in the field and had the benefit of a well
disciplined organization. But as they only
claimed to havb about 16,000 members, It
Little Interest Taken in the Election,
Rodriqiiez Winning by a Large
Majority. .
is obvious that a large portion of the vot
ing population of Havana, perhaps 30,000,
was not attracted to the ranks of the
party during the year and half prior
to. the election. This was chiefly the re
sult of a lack of confidence in the party
leader?.
Another fact demonstrated by the elec
.tion is the inability of the Republican
leaders, headed by Juan Gualberto Gomez
and Domingo Mendenez Capote, with their
organ. La Discussion, to cut an important
figure in the politics of Havana. The Re
publican leaders have failed all along the
line to justify their pretensions.
Senor Mora contends that he polled a
majority of the voters in the better class
districts and he attributes the triumph
of the Nationalists to "fraud and the
votes of the mob." â¢
Impartial judges attribute the outcome
to the hard work done by the Nationalist
leaders. General Rodriguez declines to
outline his plans, preferring to wait until
the Havana charter has been made public
with its definition of his powers. Al
though the cry of the Nationalists was
that the people should choose the revolu
tionary leaders because the work of the
revolution was not complete and in order
to prove to the intervening government
that the people of Cuba considered it in
complete, nevertheless many of the lead
ing Councilmen elected and two of those
who wer*- most anxious to secure the
mayoralty are not in any sense revolu
tionists. The people also are asking where
the pacficos are to come in.

News Filtering Through From
Chinese Cities Adds to the
General Anxiety.'
LONDON. June 1S-3 A. M.-There Is
rot a Cabinet In Europe, apparently, that
kr.cn what has been transpiring in Pe
king for five days or in Tientsin for three
days Nor is there any that knows with
what difficulties the small and Inadequate
ly equipped international column is con
tending between those cities. The Ger
man Foreign Office, upon learning: the re
port of the murder of Baron von Kette
ler the German Minister at Peking, sent
a telegraphic inquiry to St. Petersburg,
the Russian Government, because of Its
wires to Manchuria, being supposedly in a
better position than the other Govern
ments' to obtain direct news. In reply
the German Foreign Office was informed
that nothing whatever was known on the
subject, as communication with Peking
was interrupted.
The report, spread world wide from
Shanghai, that the legations had been at
tacked and that one Minister, probably
the German, had been murdered, has been
traced to Tao Tal Sbeng, who lor a few
days, as the Empress Dowager's agent.
has been censoring the telegrams from
Snar.ghai. The Shanghai correspondent
of the Dally Express says:
"Sheng, as head of the telegraph admin
istration, pretended that the line connect
ing Shanghai with Peking had been down
since June 9 and -that the wires to Tien
tsin were cut on June 15. Nevertheless
it is notorious that constant communica
tions have been passing from Shanghai
to Peking over the northern and western
routes, although Sheng has refused both
Ministers and Consuls the pri\llege of us
ir.g the lines. It is known that last Friday
Sher.g received a message from either
Peking or Tientsin. The dispatch said
that General Tung Fuh Slang's troops
aided the Boxers in an organized attack
on foreign legations, and that in the
course of the attack some of the legation
buildings were reduced to ruins and one
Foreign Minister was sliced to pieces
Why in the cables it should have been
add*d that the murdered Minister was
Baron von Ketteler Is not explained."
According to another telegram from
Shanghai, \dated June 17 at 7:2S p. m..
Sheng hasVfied, fearing that the foreign
authorities Vere about to arrest him be
cause of his stoppage of telegrams.
Danger of a Massacre. *
A third cablegram asserts that the re
ports of the murder of the German Min
ister emanated from London and that
they are quite unconfirmed and discredit
ed at Shanghai.
"The German Minister has been cap
tured." is the announcement to the Morn
ing Post from Peking in a dispatch dated
June 13. 5 p. m., via Tientsin. June 15.
This is the latest press message known to
have left Peking.' It continues as follows:
"A crowd of Boxers occupied Lega
tion street, cutting off Â¦communication be
tween the buildings. A few Boxers are
parading in the city. Their superstition
in regard to foreign arms is pitiable. The
Boxers hold the officials of Tung Chau
for redemption. Anarchy reigns at that
THIRD DAY WITHOUT
OFFICIAL ADVICES
WASHINGTON. June 17.â The third day
passed here without a single line of news
from any official source respecting the
critical situation in China. All day the
telegraph offices at the White House and
in the State, War and Navy departments
were manned, but no word came. In
quiries of the cable companies showed
that not only were the communications by
wire with Peking. Taku. Tientsin and ail
Northern China suspended, but the no
tices conveyed little encouragement for
the hope that they would be soon re
opened.
The War Department early In the day
received the following message from head
quarters at New York:
"The only news from the East to-day
is the notice of interruption of the Great
Northern lines between Blagowestchensk
and Tschita. which cuts all communica
tion with China and Japan via that
route."
The line referred to is a land wire run
ning out of Peking to Tschita to the north
and connecting with the Russian Siberian
system. Thence land wires run through
Korea and by a short cable across to
Nagasaki. Japan.
The State Department to-day received
numerous telegrams from relatives and
friends of Americans in Northern China
and in Peking praying for news touching
the welfare of their friends. Mr. Led
yard of Detroit, father of the wife of the
German Embassador at Peking, reported
to have been killed by the Boxers, was
one of the most anxious of these inquirers,
and ex-Secretary Alger was another, each
intimating a willingness to meet any ex
pense that might be Involved in an order
from the department to some responsible
official near the scene of the trouble to
send information by any means In their
power.

PARIS. June 17.â A telegram received
to-day from the French Consul at Hong
kong does not mention the reported mur
der of the German Minister at Peking or
the reported destruction of the legations
there. The French Consul at Tientsin tele

MASSACRE OF HUNDREDS
OF NATIVES IN PEKING
NEW YORK, June 17.â The World has this from Hongkong, dated June 18: All unpro
tected foreign buildings in Peking have been destroyed. Hundreds of natives have been
murdered. The Boxers have cut the railway behind the column of British, American
and other foreign marines sent by British Admiral Seymour to the relief of Peking. This
has shut off the column's supplies. The column is reported to have had an Â« engagement
with the Chinese, with what result is not stated.
All wires to Tientsin are cut. The' United States battleship Oregon is taking on
coal and provisions here preparatory to leaving. Great activity is displayed by the British
naval authorities in Hongkong. The cruiser Terrible and a transport with 700 troops have
sailed for North China. The armored cruiser Undaunted left suddenly for the north on Sat

Hundreds of Christians Slain.
The Peking correspondent of the Times,
in a dispatch dated June 14, via Tientsin,
June 13, says:
"A serious ar.ti-foreign outbreak took
place last nightr when the finest buildings -
in the eastern part of the city were burned
and"" hundreds of native Christians and
servants employed by foreigners were
massacred within two miles of the Impe
rial Palace. It was an anxious night for
all foreigners, who were collected under
the protection of the foreign guards. The
Boxers burned the Roman Catholic East
Cathedral, the large buildings of the Lon
don Mission and the American Board of
Missions, and also the buildings in the
eastern part of the city occupied by the
foreign employes of the maritime customs.
"If the troops to reinforce the Foreign'
Guards fail to arrive to-day further riots
are expected. It is believed that no Eu
ropeans have been/ Injured."
"Telegraphic communication with the
north." says the Shanghai correspondent
of the Times, under Sunday's date,
"ceased early this morning-. The last
message from Tientsin reported that fight

"The Boxer movement Is gaining

The morning papers generally consider
the situation in China more serious than
ever, but i they have â¢ so thoroughly ex
hausted the superlatives that there Is not
much left to be said. They advise that
some of the rumors be received with cau
tion. The Times says:
"The anxiety with which further news

fact that the perils of the situation in Pe

HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL,
\k^y WASHINGTON. June 17. â American troops are now on
their way from Manila to Taku. Whether or not they will
be landed will depend upon the situation existing on their ar
rival. The administration has come to the conclusion that to
insure the protection of American life and property throughout
China order must first be re-established in Peking and the Em
press Dowager and the Tsun Li Yamen impressed with the abso
lute necessity of acting as the powers desire in tne matter 01 pre
serving foreigners and their interests from harm. When nor
mal conditions return then will be discussed the question of the
indemnity due American missionaries for the destruction of their
missions and perhaps the powers may determine the political fu
ture of the emDire.
For the present, however, tHe President is concerning him
self solely with measures to take to reach Americans and provide
them with protection. Peking and Tienstin were silent to-day,
as they were yesterday and as the former has been since 10:49
o'clock on Tuesday night. Secretary Hay said to-night that he
had heard nothing from Minister Conger or any of the Consuls.
The Navy Department stated it was without advices from
Rear Admiral Kempft, and European embassies and the Japan
ese Legation replied in answer to inquiries that their several gov
ernments had not advised them of any developments in the
Chinese situation.
The President decided it was inadvisable to wait until Ad
miral Kempft mig-ht send a ship to the cable station, and by his
direction Rear Admiral Crowninshield. chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, sent this morning an instruction to the gunboat
â¢Yorktown. at Chefu. to which point telegraphic communication
is open, directing her to proceed at once to Taku with a message
to Admiral Kempft. The dispatch to Admiral Kempft is a re
iteration of the instructions cabled to him on Friday after the
Cabinet meeting: to wire at once a statement of the situation and
asking if he is in need of ships or troops. There is also reason
to believe that he has been advised of the character of the in
structions sent to Major General MacArthur. The Yorktown
will reach Taku to-morrow and under the instructions given
her will receive Admiral Kempft's reply and proceed to the near
est telegraph station, probably Port Arthur, from which point
Admiral Kempft's response will be wired.
In dispatching troops from Manila to Taku for use if needed,
tlie President is acting in accordance with his desire to be pre
pared for any emergency that may have developed or should
develop. If there be no need for troops when the transport
conveying them arrives at Taku, it will be an easy matter for
them to be returned to Manila and the men will have the benefit
which the sea voyage gives. It is altogether likely, however,
that troops will be required.
Attention was called to-day to the fact that the provision
train which started to the relief of Vice Admiral Seymour's
column was compelled to return to Tientsin. The international
force is therefore isolated, though it is thought it is still strug
gling on its way to Peking. The cutting off of communications
with Vice Admiral Seymour may seriously delay the work of re
lieving the foreign legations in Peking.
The latest information from his column was to the effect
that it was suffering from want of water and other supplies and
"â¢was making slow progress. Its commander may deem it neces
sary to restore communication before going farther. In any
event the inability of the international force to maintain open
communication shows that it is not strong enough to cope with
the situation and that additional troops are necessary.

MANILA, June 18, 10 a. m.â The Ninth Regiment has been ordered to Manila, whence it will proceed to China. For more than a year the Ninth In
fantry has been serving in the Philippines. It was stationed at Madison Barracks, New York, and in March, 1899, received orders to proceed to Manila.
It was with Major General MacArthur in operations against the insurgents last winter and is now distributed among nine towns, including Tarlac, O'Donnel,
Capas, Bamban, Victoria, Murcia, Gerona and Conception.
The regiment is under the command of Colonel Emerson H. Liscum.. who served with distinction during the Civil War. During the Spanish war Col
\ onel Liscum was tendered the rank of brigadier general of volunteers, which he accepted. He was mustered out on December 31 j 1898, and returned to
the command of his regiment. His second in command is Lieutenant Colonel C. A. Coolidge, who also performed' gallant service during the Civil War and
who distinguished himself in Indian campaigns, receiving the brevet of major for his conduct in action against the Indians. The majors now with the regi
ment are Jesse M. Lee; who was counsel for Major General Miles during the beef investigation, and James Reagan.

NEW YORK, June 17. âClement P. Rust
of Oakland Is at the Astor. L. Joseph,

No microscopic examination will be needed to con
vince an intelligent man that Kinyoun has buboes on
the brain.
The ice trust exposure in New York has had the
effect of putting the Van Wyck Presidential boom
into such cold storage it will never thaw out this side
of hades.
There is no bubonic plague in this city, but never
theless if the Kansas City folks should decide to fumi
gate the delegates to the Democratic convention from
this locality no harm would be done.
The popular celebration of the Fourth of July will
be exceptionally vigorous this year by way of patriotic
protest against the sillybillies who are going to try to
turn it into a Bryanitc sideshow.
The young ladies of Wellesley College seemed to
have reached the very pinnacle of proficiency in
American collegiate attainments. They hazed one of
their number the other day nearly to death.
The Chinese crisis has given the concert of Europe
an opportunity to play a star engagement, and if it
does not do well enough to make itself a permanent
attraction it will have to go out of business at once.
Russia and the United Sta'cs are to arbitrate the
points in dispute between them over the Bering Sea
fisheries, but neither will arbitrate with China, for
China is not a Christian country and has neither an
army nor a navy that could hurt anything.
It is certainly curious that the constitutional
amendment authorizing the city of San Francisco to
pay its outstanding bills should have been lost in the
shuffle at Sacramento, but such accidents will happen
so long as we have shufflers to do legislative business.
FOR A GARDEN PARTY.

bolero is edged with narrow black velvet.
The lower part, sleeves and apron of the
skirt* are of muslin. In narrow stitched
pleats. The rest Is In lace edged with vel
vet and the waistband la of draped velvet.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
On the same wall hangs a Hugo Fisher.
"Emerald Bay," Lake Tahoe, with hill
and tree and water, but without one sin
gle feature of distinction save a certain
decency of composition. The water Is not
wet. For contrast in this regard compare
it with its next door neighbor, "On the
Marne at Champigny." It lacks move
ment, depth, the trees are stagey, the hills
without legitimate effect of distance. and
the whole tone muddy.
"On the Marne at Champigr.y, by W.
Baird includes a delightful bit of water
painUng, and it is interesting in this con
nection to compare, even in this small col
lection, the attempts at river, sea and lake
imposed upon a patient public. One artist
shows a river of glass, another a green
silk lake, another a pool of polished steel.
With yet another painter of seas the
waves "are "posed" always â immobile from
over-conscientiousness of treatment, but
Mr. Baird has succeeded in getting "water
as Is water"â a dimpled, sunny, flowing
stream, singing as It goes. The whole
color scheme of the picture Is clean and
sunny throughout, with no false note, ex
cept perhaps an over-purple distance. As
a composition, "On the Marne" is less ad
mirable. It is lacking in plot and balance,
and evidently composed itself. The ducks
are well and humorously drawn.
Joseph Greenbaum shows his Salon pic
ture "La Priere," recently on exhibition

Said .Toaquin Miller on his return. from
the far north, speaking of Alaskan color:
"Never was such color. It Is color com
pleted, crowned, achieved! The innermost
soul of blue, the rose of heaven, glinting,
gleaming, glowing with beauty indescrib
able. As one sees the sun trying to get
his chin up over the hills beyond â he can
not quite â to look down Into the gorge be
neath, sending ehafts of light into the
heart of themâ well, I have no words. It
needB a new Columbus to capture the
color up there: It is a new world to con
quer." But William Keith had already
discovered Alaska at that time, and there
hangs in his studio now a rare Impression
of the northern wonderlandâ a pearly,
opalescent, jeweled sort of scene, which
amply : testifies to the difficulty of word
painting when such color is in question.
Theodore Wores shows a. portrait of
Lovell White this week, and the likeness
is a good one, as in all Mr. Wore's por
traits. - But the pose is somewhat stiff and
there is a certain hardness abotft the tech
nique, especially in the treatment of the
hands. Th^portralt is well placed and
good, though not subtle In color.
oN one of the local galleries this week
are two Yosemite scenes of Tom Hill's,
jl not new there, but now hung to at
tract Both pictures are eminently
characteristic of the painter, his fine
workmanship and cool, pearly tone, and
they are to be had for a priceâ an ex
ceedingly reasonable one. That they came
into their present quarters through the
settling up of an esate doubtless explains
the unusual figure.

PERSONAL MENTION.
As a final word upon the conference it is said: "It
ought to be proclaimed from the housetops that the
Government of the United States will not afford an
asylum for Europeans, residents of South America,
who seek the protection of our naturalization laws,
and that no claim for damages against one of our sister
republics shall be presented by our diplomatic, agents
unless the claimant is a genuine citizen of this coun
try,'and what is more important is the proclamation
by the United States as a principle of international
policy that the political and geographical integrity of
the American republics, shall be preserved and pro
tected."
Despite these obstacles, Mr. Curtis believes much
may be accomplished to bring, about more cordial re
lations with our southern neighbors by wisely directed
action aÂ£ the conference of American republics to be
held in the City of Mexico between May and. October
of next year. He says something should be done to
obtain from all South American governments the
recognition of United States diplomas, particularly
those of doctors and dentists, and to prevent impos
tors from claiming professional diplomas from insti
tutions in this country; efforts should be made to con
clude treaties for the portection of commercial travel
ers against extortionate fees often imposed by local
authorities, which now constitute a serious embargo
upon commerce, and uniform quarantine laws should
be established for mutual protection.
It is added that the people of Latin America "have
more sentiment than we and arc more inclined to be
governed by sentimental reasons in their political and
commercial relations." The Conservatives, or
Spanish party, "take advantage of every disagreeable
incident to prejudice public opinion against the
United States and the recent acquisition of territory
has afforded them an opportunity of crying 'I told you
so.' They have long argued that 'la grande republica'
intended sooner or iater to extend its sovereignly
over the entire hemisphere, so when we took Porto
Rico and assumed a protectorate over Cuba they pro
claimed that it was the first step in the march of con
quest southward."
Mr. Curtis begins by pointing out some of the fac
tors which create friction between ourselves and the
people of Latin America. In the first place a con
siderable number of European adventurers come to
the United States, take out naturalization papers, then
go to South America and whenever they do wrong
claim from this country a protection which their own
country would not have given because of their record
at home. Of these it is said: "Such claims are the
cause of constant irritation and furnish ground for the
allegation that we bully our sister republics, when we
ought to assist and encourage them." In the second
place our Government has not followed a consistent
policy in dealing with South American countries. Ac
tions taken by President Arthur to arrange commer
cial treaties were reversed when Cleveland came into
office for his first term, reciprocity arrangements
made during Harrison's administration were revoked
when Cleveland returned to office, while the efforts
made to establish reciprocity under the Dingley tariff
have not been of a nature to satisfy the demands of
the South American statesmen.

THE PAN-fJMERlCAN CONGRESS.
WITTY POPE AND WICKED NODLEMAN.
WHILE the beautiful character of
the present Pope." writes Jeanne
Boule in the Chicago Times-Her
ald, "places him first in the esteem
of millions, he ow#s a great deal of his
popularity to talents not generally known.
He has a firm hold on the world of art
and letters, and, in society, has long
been noted as a wit. It i? said that he
has the greatest power of repartee of
any man in Europe. It i3 an odd thing to
remind one that 'the greater the saint
the greater the humorist.' This has so
generally passed into a first principle with
students of men that one can understand
why the wisest theologians are given to
doubt the sanctity of the man who does
not enjoy a joke.
"Those who have lived near his Holiness
or who .have associative ties with him,
know a volume of stories of his wit. His
humor is of the sublime kind: it never
wounds or stings. It raises a laugh, but
always to lift the hearer to a calm height
not before known. Only once in all these
contes drolatiques does he appear to have
made a retort that stabbed, and then the
victim richly deserved it. A well-known
nobleman of one of the proud families an
tedating Christianity (some of them a
old and as wicked as Satan), who may be
named the Count de Threestars", was rash
enough to boast at a club in Rome that
he could and would put the Holy Father
at a disadvantage. He had begun by
disagreeing with his companions in their
statement that no one could disconcert
1 the pontiffs ready wit. and finished by
sayins that he could do so. Now, this
was before L.eo XIII had assumed "the
tiara, and was only Cardinal Pecei.
" 'You will get the worst of it,' his circle
warned him, 'and you will wish all the
rest of your life that you had let him
alone.'
"But the Count de Threestars was a
headstrong man, and he was bold in his
assurance. Bets were freely offered, but
only two were taken, that the adventur
ous man -would stand no chance of
getting off even third best from an en
counter with so accomplished an ecclesi
astic. It was arranged that the trial of
wit should take place on the occasion of
a diplomatic dinner, when the Count de
Threestars should be placed near the Car
dinal and given his opportunity to crush
the^ priest as flat as the tablecloth.
â¢'The evening arrived, and the naughty
nobleman was seated on the left of the
Cardinal, where he could be under the
charm and grace of the distinguished
man, and where all in the secret should
hear the music of his vofce. The dessert
was far advanced when, in the most
natural way, the Count de Threestars, in
perfectly assumed courtesy, offered the
Cardinal his snuff-box, that he might par
take. It was a jewel of workmanship, and
with his thumb slipped beneath." the noble
man held it so that its lid Inclined
to give the best view of it3 decoration,
this being a certain Venus of Titian,
painted in the frank and fearless old
fashion even for Titian.
"The circle was watching-, breathless In
admiring; horror, wondering what should
be the outcome of this daring intrusion
upon a man of such piety and spotless
morals as Cardinal Pecci. The holy father
looked steadily at the Venus for a mo
ment. Then he threw his head back and
half closed hi3 eyes, as if to set a pood
focus, all the while giving the lookers-on
an eternity within some seconds. Finally
he raised his eyebrows Interrogatively,
and said to the nobleman, sweetly:
" 'lime, la Comtesse?' (Your wife.)
"The snuff-box fell to the floor with a
crash, and the man's whole body
trembled with rape aÂ£ this deadly insultâ
the worst such a man could encounter,
and his eyes looked as if. but for the cloth
that separated their ranks, he could have
killed the smiling ecclesiastic on the
spot. But he never troubled Cardinal
Pecci again. People tell and writÂ© in
salon and private letters from Rome of the
charming grace of his touch upon tho
ordinary things of life, the discovery of
possibilities of fun where no one ever
seemed to have seen It before."
NATIONAL trade was almost wholly devoid of
feature last week. Structural steel men got to
gether and cut the quotations to conform to the
current shrinkage in merchandise values, but aside
from this there was hardly a ripple on the commercial
pool.
We scein to be doing business on the lines of fifty
3 - cars ago. Speculation is dropped, futures attract
little attention and the business of the country is be
ing conducted in the old methodical Dutch way. The
cunous feature is that wars do not appear to produce
any change of consequence in the drift of business.
For some years it has been the slogan of the wheat
pit that a foreign war would cause an immediate and
icvcrish expansion of trade and a corresponding rise
in the price of all classes of merchandise the world
ever. A pood old-fashioned war was the Moses ex
pected to lead the commercial tribes through the wil
derness and deliver the land. The wars have come
along all right and others are gathering in the
horizon, but commerce is as sluggish as a turtle. The
convulsions of the Spanish-American war produced. a
corner in Manila hemp. The South .African war,
which followed soon nfterward, instead of lifting the
price oi wheat and diamonds, and almost even-thing
else worth living for, lifted nothing but the price of
Missouri mules. Xor was this particularly beneficial
to the mule. It may be. to be sure, that the baneful
influence of politics is so prostrating to trade that in
a Presidential year nothing but an extraordinary con
vulsion is able to quicken the paralyzed commercial
body. However this may be, it is certain that trade
is fiat all over the country and nobody apparently
cares whether school keeps or not. Wall street re
ceives the most startling news from South Africa
and China with the blinking stupor of an owl at noon.
The B.ink of England lowers its rate of discount to 3
per cent, the lowest figure for a long time. This
shows abundance of meney and good financial condi
tions in London, but nobody says a word. Whether
New York sends gold to London or London sends it
to New York apparently concerns nobody. Such is
the condition of trade in the United States to-day.
Everybody expects dullness in trade in summer, but
this apathy is something new.
But the announcement on Saturday that the State
had been put under general quarantine demoralized
the whole mercantile and agricultural community. It
was a thunderbolt out of a cloudless sky. Nobody
expected it. Its effect on trade will, of course, depend
wholly en its duration. If it is continued any length
of lime the damage to California will be reckoned by
minions. To the fruit-grower it will be the disaster
of the century, for a quarantined State means the im
mediate suppression of all shipments of fruit out of
the State. Anybody who has lived a year in Cali
fornia knows wvhat this means.
Aside from this calamitous quarantine the outlook/
for a good season is most promising. Wheat has
been showing the premonitory quiverings of an ad
vance, owing to diminished crop prospects in the
"West and Northwest, and hay, which everybody
thought was going to be a drug, has suddenly, sur
prised the farmer by advancing. The fruit market,
too, is proving an agreeable surprise. Notwithstan-I
thc uniformly 'liberal crops throughout the State,
prices thus far have been rather above the normal
ar.d the demand has certainly been active. In one or
two varieties, such as pears and apricots, prices seem
low; but this is purely contrastive, as these two fruits
have been selling at enormous quotations during the
past two years and several years ago the present quo
trtions would have been considered very good. Other
iincs of produce, such as wool, hides, hops, cured
meats, etc., arc dull, with gradually declining prices.
The livestock market keeps up very well and pork is
extremely scarce and firm. Dairy products have sold
well all the spring, and cows are higher than for years.
The tendency in all manufactured goods., however, is
still downward. But considered in the aggregate the
commercial situation in the State is very satisfactory,
the quarantine, of course, execpted.

The race that he has inspired with the spirit of
conquest acquired its virility, its thews and sinews, its
distinctive character and its overcoming quality and
hardy temper by survival of the fittest in a contest,
ages long, with the cold and forbidding aspects of na
ture, in the unfriendly north. Whenever it has
seated itself in the south it has degenerated, physically
and morally. Nature has forbidden it passage of the
boundary she has set for the races of men. None can
remove her landmark. Cancer and Capricorn cannot
be conquestcd. and, until the zodiac changes, Anglo-
Saxon thirst for dominion will be punished by ex
tinction of the race between the tropics.
It is the fashion to Llame the Governments of coun
tries like England and the United States for this
lapse toward ideals that are associated with the crude
and barbarous ages. But a calm philosophy will look
behind government to the force which actuates it :
and that force at present is the Anglo-Saxon appe
tite for power. It was the passion of the Vikings; it
was the force that founded the power of the North
men in Normandy and transferred it to the British
Isles. It was alwaj's cruel, but had its historic justi
fication in the founding of civil institutions as the re
sult of conquest. But, as we have often contendedi
these institutions, like the passion for dominion
which preceded them, are racial, and they can exist
only where the race can perpetuate itself from gener
ation to generation. This is left out of Kipling's
philosophy. He recognizes no physical facts, and
climatic characteristics do not* enter into his calcu
lations at all.
His nearest American representative' is Governor
Roosevelt, whose advocacy of "the strenuous life" is
a complete crystallization of Kipling's ideas.
That estimate is true. None of the critics of Kip
ling has as keenly analyzed his style and purpose and
the nature of his influence and its effect upon the
world.
From Lion's Head to Lino!
He anticipates further conquests. He urges English
men to stand together for the last great fight of all,
Russia being evidently in mind, and nourishes racial sus
picion and hatred to that end. His religion does not
surpass his ethics. God is not the God of the human
family, including The Russian r.r.d the Boer, but the God
of the .Anglo-Saxon race, the "Lord of our far-flung
battle line." On the whole, and apart from his lighter
an-I purely literary performances, Kipling represents the
temporary recrudescence of barbarism among Knglish
r-i>cuking peoples, and helps to create it. He stands for
an expr.nsicn of dominion and a contraction of ideasâ a
withering of some of the best sentiments that have ever
visited man's heart, and that had been supposed to be
the special glory of tht nineteenth century.
The influence of Kipling upon the minds of men
in the United States is hardly secondary to that upon
Englishmen. lie has popularized here reasons for
public action which five years ago were utterly re
pugnant to the American mind. This fact has not
escaped thoughtful attention in this country. Re
cently Mr. William M. Salter, in Chicago, made this
public estimate of Kipling, which, while moderate in
tone, is admonitory in its conclusions:
Kipling if. a public influence. He stands along with
statesmen in shaping the course of affairs-only his in
fluence is subtler. He stirs the feelings, ambitions and
Ideals of men. The writer of the charming Jungle
Hooks and of racy short stories is more â he is the poet
of militant England and militant America, of a militant
ethics and a militant rel'sion. He never sings of liberty,
he nowhere pleads for the' oppressed. He is the com
plete antithesis of poots like Byron and She'ley, Loweli
and "Whittier. He celebrates the soldier and war. He
sneered at the Czar's proposal for peace among nations.
His ideal is of Britishâ or, at best. Anglo-Saxonâ su
premacy in the world. He summoned us to lay hold of
the Philippines. He was one of the causes of the Uoer
war, making Cape Town years ago dreamâ
Of empire to the northward. Ay, one land
Perhaps no man who has reached the Premiership
has preceded his elevation with equal service to the
British empire, therefore no one need wonder if Kip
ling should attain that position and administer it in
the virile spirit which has made it possible for him
tc aspire.
Not only in Great Britain has his influence been
potent. It has gone out into the world and changed
or quelled the conscience of nations, until the strong
arc combined against the weak and pity makes no
sign and mercy no protest. In this way he has done
more for England than all her finished and astute
diplomacy could accomplish. The only opposition
she encounters is from the same motive that urges
her aggressions. Of course that simply cements her
people in the purpose to overrun and capture every
thing she can reach, because otherwise her neigh
bors will do the same thing, and by additions to their
empire will more nearly equalize her power.
THERE has been a recent rumor of Rudyard
Kipling's ambition to enter higher politics in
Great Britain. It is said that he aspires to be
Prime Minister, and from that high place guide Eng
land's destiny as an empire. It must be admitted
that there is nothing improbable nor impossible in his
way, if he choose to seek such preferment. Not z
single statesman nor a great company of statesmen* in
Great Britain can claim to have done as much in
modern times to popularize the means of empire. He
has given it a sentimental basis, and has clothed it
in the garments of romance. What Peter the Hermit
was to the Crusades. Kipling has been to the march
of British power. He has quenched the scruples of
mercy, has made cruelty seem kindness; greed has
become benevolence under his touch, and selfishness
has lost its cold calculation, and been made to appear
as sacrifice.
KIPLING A BARBARIAN.
It is time for the people of San Francisco and in
deed of all California to take steps to obtain the re
moval from office of this incompetent and mischievous
official. It is now the duty of representative men to
gather all the facts of the deplorable and wretched
business and lay them before the President. The ex
tent to which the interests of the city and the State
have been injured is already great, but it will be much
greater if this outrageous order b\j permitted to re
main in force and the falseness of its pretensions be
unexposed. The harm which a pig-headed' mischief
maker can do when intrusted w.ith official power is
now clear to us and we must getfpid of Kinyounism
by getting rid of Kinyoun.
It is a law of the natural order of the world that one
evil begets another, that wrong grows out of wrong,
and this case furnishes an illustration of the rule. Out
of the reports of bubonic plague in the Chinatown of
Sah Francisco there have developed reports of plague
in. the Chinatowns of other parts of the State. Unless
something be done to quarantine the liars and eradi
cate the lies the whole State will soon be reputed to be
stricken with the pkgue. , We shall have Kinyoun
raging from one degree of offensivencss to another.
He may even become so besotted as to believe his
own words and enforce his own order, and then we
shall see it established that no one can leave any part
of the State without undergoing fumigation.
The quarantine order is to the effect that transporta
tion companies shall not "issue transportation to any
one leav.ng San Francsico for other States or Terri
tories of the United States unless on presentation of
a cert.ficate signed by a Marine Hospital officer."
~nd the inspectors stationed at* the State border have
been instructed to permit "no passengers coming
frcra San Francisco to pass unless a certificate is fur
rushed. That is the order and yet evidence shows
that any white person can obtain a certificate with
out undergoing any examination whatever The
oracr is in fact a fraud. It was prepared before Judge
Mcrrow gave .his decision against the quarantine of
Chinatown and was designed for the sole purpose of
enabling K.nyoun to have his way should the decision
Le adverse to the quarantine. It has not been en
forced honestly on its own terms and the presumption
is it was not honestly designed. If Kinyoun believes
that persons going from San Francisco are likely to
cany the plague to other localities then he is to bz
condemned for issuing his certificates to any and
every white person who applies without making "inves
tigation. Either the order is dishonest in intent or it
is dishonest in its application. That much is ap
parent on the surface of things and cannot be dis
puted.
KINYOUN'S QUARANTINE OUTRAGE.
â¢~N UARANTINE OFFICER KINYOUN will
V v/ **iave to a Ppcar before Judge Morrow this
morning to answer a charge of contempt of
court. He should also be brought to answer for of
fences sufficiently grave to justify his summary re
moval from office. He has now been guilty of some
tning more than mere incompetency, for his latest
quarantine order is so unwarranted, so disastrous and
is enforced with such gross partiality as to amount to
a serious misdemeanor.
Combined Jieets of the powers
in
Chinese (Waters.
SINCE the recent occupation of Chinese
territory by Germany at Kiaochau,
Russia at Port Arthur and Great
Britain at Wd-Hai-Wei the fleets of
the several naval powers in China waters
| have been greatly increased in anticipa-
I tion of the troubles -which have become
! stern reality. The growth of the United
j States fleet in Asiatic waters became j
j necessary throush the war with Spain and j
I latterly with the Philippines, and its pres- |
! ent strength Is very opportune. Prior to ;
! the battle in Manila Bay we had only six i
I vessels, of 13,737 tons, with 14% officers and !
; crew; now we have a fighting force of
j twenty-one ships, -with a complement of ]
j 3SV7, besides contingents of land and naval |
I forces aggregating thousands that may j
be made available on short notice.
As China has practically no navy, the I
.fleets on her coast are useful only to level i

SIMMARY OF FOREIOX FI^EETS
There will no doubt bo some rivalry as
to which power will take possession of th*
five splendid Chinese cruisers just out from
the Klswick ami (terman yards. They are
the fastest of their types, but unless taken
I care of by others than Chinese will soon
[ deteriorate and become useless.

His Name.
The police have not yet bfen able to
find the man who fired tÂ«Â»e shot, that
wounded George Mirandette. the waiter.
Detectives Graham and Fitzgerald were
detailed on the case. They found that
Mrs. Mirandette and the unknown assail
ant of her husband had been out together
several times previous to the night of the
Bbooting- Yet the lady claims that she
did not know what the man's name waa
or where he worked. .The only informa
tion that 5he could give was that he was
an electrician, and that he roomed at the
corner of Kills and Leavcnworth streets.
She also advanced the information that
he was dark and clean shaven. Detec
tive Graham went down to the Scottish
Hall Saturday night with Mrs. Miran
dette to find the dark man if possible, as
he ascertained from outside informa
tion that this mysterious person was very
partial to dancing at that hall, and that
he had several weeks before had trou
ble with Mirandette there on account of
hi? attentions to the wounded man's wire.
They did not find him.
Graham and Fitzgerald stated last night
that they think the Mirandette family
know well enough who the man is whr>

known to themselves they will not give
the desired information.

of Notre Dame des
Victoires.
t
A largo class of boys and girls received
first communion at the 8 o'clock mass yes
terday in tha Church of Notre Dame des
Victo'res. The scene during the ceremony
was highly impressive. Thirty-nine little

the right arm, participated.
Shortly before the hour fixed for the
services the candidates formed in line in
their hall in the basement and marched
through the alslo to their seats in the

lighted candle in his hand, which added to
the effect. The church was crowded with
the parents and friends of the children, j
The altar was beautifully decorated with !
flowers presented by members of the con

After the choir had rendered a hymn
Constant Simon, one of the boys, mounted
the pulpit, and in a clear voice read acts
before the mass. Rev. Father Guibert,
S. M., followed, and preached a short and J
able sermon before and after mass. The !
acts after mass were read by Miss Helens I
Lavergne. Throughout the services the
children sang hymns. They marched two
by two to the altar and received holy
communion. As the boys and girls stood
in line at the rail holding the lighted can
dles, which they offered to the church,
they presented a striking picture.
In the afternoon at 3 o'clock the class
made a renewal of their baptismal vows
and reheard the consecration of
the Blessed Virgin, which latter was
read by Miss Clemence Sarmet. Rev.
Father Hamot, S. M., pastor of the
church, preached an able sermon which
befitted the occasion and was intended to
direct the minds of the young ones. The
children rendered a number of French
hymns and at the conclusion of the ser
vices there was solemn benediction of the
Blessed Sacrament.
Achille Artigues "presided at the organ

The Americans operated under many
difficulties and over an exceedingly rough

occupied and burned.
As the rerult of last week's scouting
sixty Filipinos were killed. 200 were cap

District Conventions.
Candidates for the lower house of the
State Legislature are in some cases nom
inated by primaries. In others by county
conventions and In others by representa
tive district conventions. In some cities
Aldermen are nominated by aldermanic
district conventions. Candidates for the
State Senate are nominated by Senatorial
district conventions. Still other districts
nominate candidates for Congress. Their
conventions meet each alternate year, and
every fourth year It Is, as a rule, the same
area which chooses a candidate for Presi
dential Klector and nominates delegates
to the National Presidential Convention.
The procedure of the various district con.
ventlons is similar to that of the county
convention.
Names of candidates for the two houses
The County Convention.
The county committee for each party
calls a county convention and specifies the
number of delegates to which each city
and town is entitled. The committee
chairman calls the meeting to order and
reads the "call." A temporary chairman
and secretary are then chosen and a com
mittee en credentials appointed. These
last examine the credentials of the dele
gates, and in case there are two sets of
delegates from the same town or city
claiming seats in the convention they re
port upon the contest to the convention,
which usually adopts the report as a mat
ter of course.
Generally the temporary organization is
made permanent, and the convention, hav
ing appointed a committee to count the
ballots, next proceeds to nominate candi
dates for county offices. Candidates are
announced In "nominating speeches" set
ting forth their qualifications. Nomina
tions are sometimes made by acclamation,
as there is often no contest In a county
convention and the ballot may be dis
pensed with.
When not otherwise chosen, a county
committee for the ensuing year Is elected
by the conventicn. The nominations hav
ing been made and routine business at
tended to, the convention adjourns sine
die.
The Crawford County Caucus.
An exceptional form of the -primary
originated in Crawford County, Pennsyl
vania, and is called by the county name.
It does away with nominating conventions
of delegates and permits the voters of
the party to vote by ballot at the polls
for their party candidates. The first elec
tion is conducted like a regular legal elec
tion, but the voters are those of a single
party only* The system i3 used in some
of the counties and districts in a dozen
or more of the States.
Party Committees.
The other branch of party organization
consists of permanent committees annually
appointed by the several primaries, cau
cuses or conventions for the various elec
tion areas. There is no uniform system.
Some States have a party committee for
every election areaâ one for each town
ship, each city, ward or precinct, each
city, county, district, and for the State.
Others have committees for the larger
areas only. Every State has its State
committee for each party and its mem
bers of the national party committee.
"Within the Etnte or the national com
mittee a small executive committee really
holds most of the power and does most
of the work.
These committees have charge of all
party business except the nomination of
candidates. They raise and pay out
money for party purposes, organize pub
lic meetings, employ speakers, print and
circulate political tracts and articles, look
after the registration of voters and nat
uralization and enrollment of immigrants,
arrange, for each election the plan of
campaign, call together at the proper
times the nominating bodies, conduct the
canvas;, provide and distribute the tick
ets at the polls. Often the regular com
mittees are assisted at election time by
others, called campaign committees, ap
pointed for the purpose. Â¦ *
Lists of the legal voters in any locality
are prepared in all the States Dy public
officials, and persons whose names are
not found on those lists may be denied
voting privileges. Announcements are
published before elections stating places
and hours for registration.
Local Party Organization.
Outside of New England the party com
mittee of each village and town calls thjÂ»
party primary, or caucus, or primary
election (which are different names lor
the same thing; to make nominations for
the local offices and to choose delegates
to the conventions to be held in the
larger areas. All party voters who re
side within the ward or town for which
the primary- acts are (entitled to member
ship in the primary.
Except in the large cities, party ques
tions often do not enter into elections ol
local officers, but the citizens divide upon
matters of purely local interest, such as
the building of a schoolhouse or a street
car line. The candidates nominated by
the party first holding a primary or cau
cus may be accepted by the opposing
party, and voted against only by those
individuals opposed to the local po*icy
which they represent.
In New England and In other parts of
the country having the New England t>pe
of town government the annual to^n
meeting tills the place of the primary and
nominates candidates for local offices and
delegates to the party conventions, inis
is often done without any previous under
standing, but sometimes there are seir
announcements. and sometimes the pri
vate -parlor caucus" decides upon tne
names to be proposed to the voters.
Anv party voter may propose names to
be voted upon, but the local committee
sometimes brings forward a list of candi
dates. This is regarded as rather an
abuse of the committee's powers.
In the cities party lines are more closely
drawn and usually reach to the minutest
ramification of the publice service. The
election unit is the ward or precinct, each
usually having its committee for each
party, by whom the primary is called.
The ward primaries elect the-ttfneers of
the ward and delegates to district conven
tions in the city (if such there are), and
to the city conventions, which nominates
-the officers elected by the whole city.
Conduct of the Primary.
The chairman of the local committee
usually calls the meeting to order and
reads the committee's call. A chairman
and a secretary having been electedâus
ually viva voceâ the caucus proceeds to
the nominations of candidates for the
various nlaces to be filled. Names of a
number of citizens may be brought for
ward and their comparative merits dis
cussed before the meeting. If choice is to
be by ballot a committee is appointed to
receive ar.d count the ballots and the of
ficial voting lists are referred to to deter
mine whose votes may be accepted. Al
most invariably, in order to avoid waste
of time in securing a majority, those who
receive the largest number of votes on the
first ballot are declared nominated. Fre
quently, when party rules or legal enact
ments do not require a ballot, choice is
made by acclamation. Each delegate re
ceives a statement of his election, signal
by the chairman and the secretary of Lho
caucus. This is called his "credential"
and entitles him to sit in the convention
to which he is delegated. ' , . '
A caucus may "instruct its delegates
to vote for the State candidate and may
require candidates nominated for the
State Legislature to pledge themselves to
vote, if elected, for a certain person for
United States Senator.
In many of the States the primaries are
actually elections merely, no opportunity
being given for the discussion of men or
measures. The decision as to candidates
then takes place in the committee or
other private gatherings of local politi
cians beft-re the voters assemble in th'?
primaries. A primary or caucus may
elect delegates to as many as six or more
annual conventions, and in those years
when a Presidential election occurs the
number Is larger still.
Our historical study of party organiza
tion has been directed chiefly to its nomi
nating function", which is its most strik
ing and apparently its mest important
purpose. But to nominate candidates is
the business of only one 1 section of the
party machineryâ a section of only tem
porary duration, and called into being for
that specific purpose.

the "State ticket." which includes only
the names of those officers voted for by
the people of the whole State.
In a fewof the older States we find cer
tain State ofiicials called Executive Coun
cilors (a relic of colonial days>. elected
annually and nominated by delegates to
councilor convention?.
The State Convention.
The "state ticket" is nominated by tha
I state cor.vfr.tior:. which is called by the
j state central committee of the party. ThÂ«
call states time and place o" meeting 1 and
the number vi delegates to which each
area to be represented is entitled. Tno
[strength ol the paity in the local areas
determines, to some extent, at least, tnÂ»
1 number of delegates sent.
The opening of a state convention Is
much like that of a county convention,
but there is usually no formal temporary
organization, the chairman and secretary
of the central committee acting until a
permanent organization is effected. The
I chairman is empowered, by vote of the
i delegates, to appoint committees on cre
1 dentials. on permanent organization and
i on resolutions. The last committee ia
j reallv in general selected and holds a
i meeting before the convention meets. The
permanent officers are president, secretary
I and assistants, with a larse number of
honorary vic-presidents and (secretaries
appointed solely in official recognition, oC
| partv services.
The president having" been conducted to
the chair is found to have come equipped
with a carefully prepared address upon
the issues of the campaign. When this
has been delivered thÂ« report of the com
mittee on credentials la made and ques
| tions of contested seats decided. Thea
i comes the report of the committee on rÂ«*
j olutions. which is thÂ« party "platform"
i of the State. This retort is usually prv
pared by leading members of the party.
sÂ»nd -tea matter of much interest. Geu
erallyiv deals with subjects of national
import and indorses or criticizes the exist
ing national administration.
After the adoption of the platform thÂ»
chair appoints a committee to attend to>
the brllotin^r fa committee whose men-
I bership has been agreed upon long before
j by the central committee). In formal
j "norrir.ntinc: speeches"' en ndi datei for tho
j office cf Governor are then brought before
the convention. If there is more than, one
candidate ba'lots are cast, and the suc
cessful aspirant usually receives a irva
â¢f jority of all the votes cast. It Is custqm
! ary for the friends of defeated aspirants
j to move that the election be made "unanl-
I mous." In a similar manner the remain-
I ing candidates are selected.
The two Presidential Electors at laxc*
| in each State everv fourth year are nom
j inated by the regular State convention: or
! (if no State officers are to be nominated
that year> by a convention called for the
purpose. Sometimes all the electora ara
nominated bv the State convention.
It is customary for the successful can
i didates for Governor and Lieutenant Gov
j ernor to be escorted to the platform be
i fore the convention clcses that they may
be introduced to the assembly and may
declare in brief speeches their acceptance
I of the honors thrust upon them.
Necessarily the routine work of tha
I State convention Is "cut and drte*i'* be
forehand by the central committee. Tha
permanent presiding officer, having been
selected some time before the assembling
of the convention. Is able to prepare a
suitable address, which may be of real
Importance, and the committee upon reso
lutions is also given time to Indite a doc
ument which shall adequately represent
the attitude of the party upon Questions
of national consequence. But too often,
the committee carries Its action beyond
the necessary or desirable limit and un-Â«
duly influences the choice of candidates,
so that the "State machine." becomes not
the servant. but the despotic master of the
party. This has been sadly exempline<*
in recent years In New York and Penn
sylvania, not to mention less striking- in.-,
stances. *
State conventions held In "off year^*â â¢
that is. years in which no Governor or
Lieutenant Governor, but only tho minor
State officers are chosenâ excite far less
interest and accomplish their duties with:
less formality. In some cases nomina
tions of State officers on oft years are left
entirely to the State Central Committee
or are referred by the convention to a
committee which reports names to ba
voted upon by the convention. Sometimes
one of these methods Is followed even
when a full State ticket Is to be elected.
Massachusetts and Rhode Island elect z
Governor annually.
Minor State Officers.
ThÂ«> officials of the State Legislatureâ *
the Speaker of the House and the Presi
dent of the Senate (in some instances tha
Lieutenant Governor I* ex-officto Presi
dent of the Senate) -with the various'
clerks and other minor officers â are elect
ed by the members of the bouses them
selves, and are nominated for each cham
ber by a caucus of the party members of
that chamber. The caucuses of the party
having a majority in the State Legislature
often excite great Interest and develop
sharp competition amon? the friends of
the several candidates. Especially 13 this
true of the contest for the Speakershlp of
the House, as that position carries with It
the appointment of all the committees.
The President of the Senate has In somar
of the States corresponding power.
The legislative caucus appoints, also, a
caucus committee to have charga of party
interests within the chamber. Occasion
ally the caucus is called to meet for tha
purpose of considering the policy of tha
party respecting questions before the Leg
islature. JESSE 3IACY.

Just what the outcome will be no one
can say. The workmen assert that they
will no longer consent to being fed by their
employers, a.-? has hitherto been the cus
tom. The employers say that they will
not. and could not if they would; accede
to their employes' demands.
The situation Is an Interesting one. The
Italian loaf, a cheaper substitute for the
genuine French article, a bad imitation
masquerading in a. Parisian guise, prom
ises to enter the field and, temporarily at
any rate, usurp the erstwhile unassailed
sovereignty cf the Gallic staff of life. The
Italian loaf retails three for 5 cents, the
French two for 10 cents. Should the French
head bakers comply with the demands of
their workmen the price of the product
would rise still higher, they allege. In
fact, they claim it would be prohibitive to
the cheaper class of restaurants.
Saturday the head bakers held a con
sultation and decided not to allow the de
mands of their workmen. They Inserted
the following notice in the morning dailies
and in one French newspaper.
HEAD BAKERSâ The following res
- olutions were adopted at a reunion of
the French Head Uakers:
Whertas, the union of the journey
men bakers has resolved to ask, be
sides the actual regular salary, the
following advantages: (1) 75 cents per
day, i_1) two pounds of bread every
day, (3) limitation to eight hours of the
labor day, (4> exclusion from the bak
eries of all bakers not members of the
union. The head bakers, after deliberat
ing and by a unanimous vote, regret to
announce that they cannot admit the
afftresaid demands, which, if adopted,
would constitute a danger for their
general interest. They hope, neverthe
less to get over the actual crisis, and
they will do their best to deliver daily
the bread to their customers as usual.
THE COMMITTEE.
As a result of this notice and decision
half the workmen employed in the French
bakeries quit work yesterday. The remain
der say that unless their demands are
complied with their labors will cease to
day.
The French bakers have struck. They
asked their employers for 75 cents a day
for food, weekly pay, two pounds of bread
daily, an eight-hour working day. and,
lastly, the exclusion from the bakeries of
all bakers not members of the newly
formed union.
From the present aspect of things the
long, sour French loaf, with appetizing
cruist, the loaf dear to the heart of the
Gallic restaurant frequenter, will be for
some little time to come chiefly conspicu
ous by its absence in the places where
once it reigned supreme.

T REV. WILLIAM RADER. t
REV. WILLIAM RADER. pastor of
the Third Congregational Church,
on Fifteenth street, near Mission,
returned from abroad yesterday a
sick man. Immediately uporf the arrival
of the overland he was tenderly taken to
his home, and is now confined to his bed
and receiving the ministration's of Dr. J.
A. Miller, his family physician.
Dr. Rader was taken ill while on the
road between New York and Buffalo, and
his condition became so serious later on
that he was compelled to stop off at
Pueblo and apain at Reno. Physicians in
those two places afforded him slight re
lief. The minister caught cold and is now
suffering from an aggravated case of la
grippe.
Owing to his sickness Dr. Rader was un
able to address his congregation last
night. He sent his regrets and promised
to preach to them on the following Sun
day if his health permitted it. He has
been absent from the city nearly four
months. He visited Europe in search of
rest and recreation, but during his stay
abroad he sent some highly interesting
and brilliant letters to religious papers,
in which he described his travels and ex
periences.
Dr. Rader has presided over the Third
Congregational Church for a great many
years. Through hard work he has built
up a congregation which is as large as
any other of his denomination in this city.
His sermons on theological subjects and
those on current matters have appeared
in the columns of the press and have at
tracted wide attention. All his friends
will learn with regret of his illness and 1
hope for his speedy recovery.

Hemarkable Curative Properties of a
Remedy for Indigestion and
Stomach Weakness.
Ftuart'p Dyppeppia Tablets, a prepara-
tion for the cure of dyspepsia and the
various forms cf indigestion and stomach
trouble, owes its great success as a cure
for these troubles to the fact that it is
prepared for di^pase and weakness of the
stomach and digestive organs only, and
is not rr-commendtd or advised for any
other disease.
It is not a cure-all, hut for any stom-
ach trouble it is undoubtedly the safest,
mos-t sensible remedy that can be ad-
vised with the prospect of a permanent
cure. It is prepared in tablet form, pleas-
ant to taste, composed of vegetable and
fruit essences, pure pepsin and Golden
f-eai. every one of which act effectively
In diisroptinp the food eaten, thereby rest-
lrg and invigoratir-s the weak stomach:
rest is nature's cure for any disease, but
you cannot rest the stomach unless you
put into it something that will do its
Trork or assist in the digestion of food.
That is exactly what Stuart's Dyspep-
Fia Tablets do: one grain of the digestive
pr'nciple contained in them will digest
3iÂ»0 grair.s of meat, eggs or similar whole-
Forne foods. They will digest the food
Â¦whether the stomach is in working order
cr rot. thereby nourishing the body and
rcftir.g the stomach at the same time
and rf-st and nourishment is nature's cure
for any weakness.
In persons run down in f.fsh and ap-
petite these tablPts build up the strength
and increase flesh, because they digest
Jiesh-forming food which the weak stom-
arh cannot do; thoy increase the flow of
pastric juice and prevent fermentation,
aridity and sour watery risings.
'Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
at all drug stores at 50 cents per package.

Last Tear's Champions Victors by a
Margin of More Than One
Hundred Runs.
The glorious uncertainty of cricket 'was
clearly exemplified yesterday when tho
AJameda team, which on paper seemed
a certain winner, was beaten by the Cali
fornia eleven on the Alameda grounds by
the ample margin of 110 runs. The Ala
meda men went to bat first, but none oC
them made any stand against the bowl
ing of Howard and Dickinson, the former
of whom took five wickets, and the latter
four. V. Seebeck. not out. 14, and "W. G.
Fortman. 11. were the only batsmen who
scored double figures. R. B. Houjre. J. J.
Moriarty and G. J. Baugh, usually to be
relied on for good scores, not compiling:
ten among them. Less than two hundred
balls served to dismiss the whoie side.
Dickenson and Howard bowling without
change throughout the innings.
When the Callfornias went to the wick
ets E. G. Sloman and A. Dickenson face^
the bowling of Harold "Ward and F. Croll,
36 runs being put on for the first wicket.
The second wicket fell without ralsinj?
the total and the third and fourth wero
captured for 40. J. Guild and A. E>. Rey
nolds then made a flne stand, so that thÂ«
fifth wicket did not fall until 126 runs had
been compiled. J. Guild scoring 42 and A.
D. Reynolds 44 runs. Six Alameda bowl
ers were tried, the most successful belncr
Saunders, who took three Â¦wickets for 2S
runs. \V. G. Fortmann captured 3 for 13
runs. The full scores are given herewith:

The day's courslnc was one of the fin
est ever held in California. It was free
from any unpleasant incident and was
vrltnesred by an unusually larpe attend
anc*. Judpe John Grace's official scores,
showing the margin by which each course
was run, are as follows;
The most course of the day
was the deciding one in the reserve stake.
The unlucky Iirutus met Greenhall. A
great shout went up from the spectators
as Jirutu? was seen to lead by ten
lengths. He scored the firpt live points
end looked all over a Winer. Greenhall
then gained possession and worked the
hare tor some time. The hare finally
â¢scaped, at which time Greenhall hail
fcore-d twelve points to Brutus' six. As
the har<" escaped a fresh one started up
frcm under the tired dogs' feet. She took
them acrefs the field and then (iibued a
battle royal. Three extra, greyhounds
ncie released and joined in the exciting
cha5e. They finally overtook the hare
and killed iL
Stprl & Knowlcs* diminutive grey
hound. For Glory, was the surprise of the
Ftake. She defeated the imported dog
Fine Fire aficr the latter led her. ShÂ«
then shut out Rural Artirt pointless and
did not retire until she- met Beacon. She
Jed the bis dog 1 f-jr a time, but he proveil
too much for her.
There was link- delay at the slips. The
course was sharp *md decisive. Palo Alto
led the tiue dog by three lengths and
secured the lirft and second turns. Bea
con then scored a turn, placing I'alo Aito
Jcr another, the last point he scored. Bea
con then drove in and killed. Mr. Cur
tis Is anxious tor a f^pecial match between
the victor and vanquished and one may be
arranged. There is also talk of a tour
cornered wcoj)stake. It is the opinion
of coursir.g men that Palo Alto will be a
harder deg to beat each week lor some
time to corn**.
Each greyhound had a big following in
the final, although Pa!o Alto was a top
heavy favorite throughout at odds of 2 to
L Palo Alto ar.d his handler, Tommy
Murr.ane, were cheered by the spectators
en their parade i>a>t the stand and down
the field, where Jiimos Grace, the clever
est slipper in America, was awaiting them.
Tommy was comjjeik-d to dorr his cap In
response to the shouting, thus ehowng his
eun-kissed hair to advantage. The bet
tors who dearly love a e hort-enderâ when
he Trtns cr has a chance to win â gavt
J4Â«>?eon an equally corciial welcome.
In his first couree he led Royal Flush
three lengths and scored two turns. Flush
pcor!r.Â£ one turn ar.d the kill. Palo Alto
next met Narcissus, which he led six
lengths. He r<Â»peat<*d this in the next
round with Luxor, winner of the John
Grace challenge cup. leading him a city
block, faft as he is.
Euprre Gravy's yovsg greyhound. Palo
Alto, went dying through the Ladies' Day
champion stake yesterday at Union Cours
ing Park. As WBM generally expected, he
met Curtis &. Sun's speediest greyhound.
Beacon, in the deciding course for the In
terstate Coursing Club's classic event.
After ihe- drawing for positions it was
thought Palo Alto was in a more diffi
cult position on the card than Beacon, but
the chances of coursing reversed the or
der of affairs. Beacon had unusually se
vcre courses with Thtron and with Glory,
VfcSa Palo AKo r.as fortunate in getting
comparatively short runs.

The race between Lily of the "West and
Oriole in the third round furnished quite
a little fun and excitement. Lily, who wa3
a 15 to 1 favorite, was very slow from
the slips, in fact seemed unsighted. Oriole
went after the game like a shot, leaving
her opponent almost at a standstill. Tho
pikers, seeing easy money in sight, yelled
lustily, while the talent seemed dura
founded. Fallon's hound, however, soon
joined in and then there was nothing to
it. A heavy sigh of relief came from the
big bettors when the red flag went uo
Oriole was beaten pointless.
Following are the day's rosults with
Judge P. J. Reilly's official scores:
The talent made Hummer a false favor
ite against Admiral Sampson in the sec
ond round. The Admiral put up a good
race and won it on merit, as the score
shows.
Tea Rose, another favorite, was beaten
in a short go with Hawker, who scored
for speed and the turn. Tea Rose got
the kill. Kittleman, for what work he
did, showed himself a good one, but was
unlucky enough to get a rough course,
which told severely against him.
The runner up was fortunate In get
ting short runs and easy game while the
winner was put to severe tests through
out the stake. In the fifth round Miss
Penman was forced to extend herself with
Lily of the West, and after an unde
cided beat that fleet runner in a long
course by a score of 10 to 6.
The talent figured that Miss Penman's
chances were slim, considering her hard
work, but she had a race left in her and
evened old scores with her recent op
ponent.
Bohe was unfortunate in the go with
Pleasant Girl in the third round. The
latter hound won the course on what waÂ»
very much of a fluke, the hare favoring
her clear through. Bohe sold favorite
at 5 to 2.
Miss Penman, Captain Cane's clever lit
tle white and brindle flier, took first
money in -the open stake at Ingleside
Coursing Park yesterday by beating Lex
ington in the deciding: round in a fast
race. Two weeks ago the dogrs opposed
each other for final honors though on re
versed conditions. Lexington then selling
on the short end at 1 to 3, got the de
cision, but as a favorite at 5 to 4 yes
terday had to be content with second
place.

OAKLAND.
The Dudes played an errorless game.
Both infield and outfield gave Bevillo per
fect support from start to finish. The
Bcore: ,â¢ â¢.
Oakland hit Babbitt all through the
game, linding him with ease from tho sec
ond to the eighth inning, while Stockton
did not succeed in punishing Beville to
any great extent. In the third and ninth
innings the millers got to him for a
couple of bunches, but they netted in the
agcregate only two runs.
A couple of errors, Babbitt's unsteadi
ness and three hits won the game for
the Brummels.
One inning told the story of the game
in the morning on the Oakland grounds
and this inning was at the far end of the
game. Up to the seventh the game was
as pretty an exhibition of baseball as
any one would care to see. Then the Dudea
bristled up and did a few things to Bab
bitt's delivery. Before the side was re
tired the entire Oakland nine had been to
the bat and six of them scored.

him to second. Harper sacrificed, advanc

to Arrelkir.es scored Courtney. Eabbltt

on the thrcw-in. Then followed more hits
by Pace, which scored Dabbitt. and b-'
McCarthy, who scored Pace. Moore rolled
out the ball for a hit and McCarthy
scored. The score:
STOCKTON'. ,
It all started when "Ax-in-the-head"
Pace scraped Lange's shin bone early in
the game and all the Stockton rootera let
loose on Lange. The chief noiay one oaid
something to "whiskers" which the latter
did not like, so . "whiskers" wanted to
mount the stand and destroy him, voice
and all. This stopped the game for a tim*
and in the succeeding: inning 1 , the seventh,
Umpire Graves fanned tho natural oil
:.an-es of tne Stccktoniar.a oy a couple of
cad-wick decisions. No other than Face
was canect out at first and immediately
a bunch or Qtcciuoniaiis crowded the field,
jr'eace was restored by a wave of Har
per's fi3t, but only for a minute. Mc-
Carthy, the next man up, put tho ball
over third, tut Graves said It was ft foul.
Stockton ire could have been bought for
nothing at this aiage. Alter another wait
ar.d much sharp talk by eighteen players
and an umpire with a chorus from tho
grimd-starid the game finally went on.
Then Stockton made n\x rune in a singlo
ir.iUiit' and there v.as ail kinds of Joy and
sorrow, according to predilection.
The game, but lor one inning, was ex
cellent, both pitchere twirllnsr in flne style,
harper was nivlnciblo yesu-rtiay ar.d hla

a run. Streib hud pone to the deaa when
jJabbiU wan g;ven the flrei Bftck on four
tad ones. LlKlr.jr Hie lniddlo station, ho
took it oh a silfle, and scored on a pretty
single from Lockheads bat to left field.
That was all that was dono in this in
ninp.
Not until tho fourth did anything hap
pen. Then Pace swatted a hard one to
jOur.lccvy and made two bags on it. On
McCarthy's out he went to third and
scored on the throw in of Moore's fly to
rilcskiman.
The fourth put Oakland on the boards.
Meekiman hit a hot grounder over sec
cr.d. which Loclchcad ended by a phenom
enal stop, but he threw wildly and Moski
man was safe at second. On Dunlcavv's
cut he went to third and scored on Ar
rel'&nc'fl hit to right which Morrow could !
not handle. '
A noisy man escaped from Stockton yes
terday and landed in the grand-stand at
Recreation grounds to see the baseball
game. What he got wap more than his
money's worth, as also did the crowd. For
about ten minutes this , noisy individual
delayed the game, had Fred Lange of the
Dudes looking for an ax. and the crowd
in the stands vocalizing in groans and
hisses.

UNION OF ALL CATHOLIC
SOCIETIES IS PLANNED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. June 17.â With a view to
political action, the project which has for
its object the federation of all societies
in the United States composed of Roman
Catholic laymen is being discussed in
Catholic circles throughout the country.
Some Influential clergymen and laymen
are interested.
By this plan all Catholic societies are
to become affiliated, although each separ
ate organization is to retain its individ
uality. The idea Is to have all members
of societies subject to a central direction,
so that they may all work together, when
fever necessary for any special purpose.
It is argued that Roman Catholics in thia
country are unfairly treated in some re
spects. The projectors of the. union hold
that the united Catholic voters would be
nble to right whatever wrongrs are now
declared U> exist. Because of the possi
bility of the projected federation getting
into politics the idea Is opposed in some
quarters. The advocates of the plan deny
that it would have anything to do direct
ly with politics. It is confidently predict
ed 1 hat a great union will be formed and
that it-will comprise Catholic societies of
all nationalities. Bishop McFaul. of Tren
ton. N. .1.. Is a warm supporter of the
project. He has prepared an address on
"The Influence of Catholic Societies," that
Is being circulated extensively in support
of the federation Idea.

THE members of St. Johannes' Ger
man Evangelical Lutheran Church
laid the cornerstone of their new
house of worship yesterday afternoon
on the lot they own on Twenty-second
street, between Howard and C-ipp streets.
The church was first organized in this city
over thirteen years ago. and the first Â«=ei
vlccs wore held in the Mission Opera Hall.
The congregation grew so rapidly that tho
trustees negotiated for and bought the old
Emmanuel Baptist Church property. They
disposed of the old building, and yester
day the cornerstone was laid for a hand
pome new rdifice. that will cost over $13.
000 and will when completed seat <oO peo

The services commenced with a shoit
prayer in German by the pastor. Rev. J.
H. Schroeder. The choir led a hymn that
â¢was Mir.g by the several hundred people
present. The pastor then delivered an ad
dreÂ«=f=. and said In part:
"'The significance of the cornerstone lay
ing before our congregation is that it is
another. token of the love of God. At this
altar we lay our praise to him ffir his
manifold kindnesses to us in the past, and
with hopes of his guardianship over this
little flock in the future. Wo. do not know
how long we shall be sparedâ in fart, wo
may not be alivo when this building is
completed, tn a few months from now;
but do not let us waste our time, but work
for tho glory of God."
The Rev. J. M. Buehler of Oakland then
made an address in English, after which
the stone was* formally laid by the Rev.
J. H. Schroeder. A copper box was laid
under the stone, with the names of the
congregation, the roll of the Sunday
school, a few coins and a copy cf The

( L__ ?0 nouncing the appointment of the Democratic State Executive Com
mittee, it was not expected that the appointment of this committee
would be made until after the 10th of July because of a legal question that had
been raised, but Mr. Farnsworth announces that the men appointed by him
will not assume their duties until July 15. The following named comprise thÂ«

At the Democratic State Convention there was ,a spirited discussion upon
the legality of the appointment of a State Central Committee. It was the
opinion of many members of the convention that the appointment of the
State Central Committee should have been left to the convention that meets
In August. Stephen M. White. James G. Maguire and Seth Mann took this
view. The committee was appointed, however, with the understanding that
it would not go into power until July 15.
The newly appointed executive committee will have a cJear field whÂ»-n it
goes Into office, as the present one will have finished all its labors by July io
PERFORMANCES AT

"A Homespun Heart," before time known
as "The Estate of Hannibal Howe," by
Judson Brusie, is the Grand Opera-house
bill this week. It is good, old-fashioned
melodrama of the quieter variety, thor
oughly wholesome and well enough staged
and acted. Frank Bacon as Amos Howe
gave an admirably drawn picture of the
honest, dryly humorous, tender old hero,
his quaint naturalness thrown into high
relief by the manifest artificiality of most
of the other roles. By the way, Mr. Bru
sie should not plagiarize Wardle's Fat
Boy without some slight acknowledgment,
though Gus Tate does help him so clever
ly. Fay Courtenay Is a dainty ingenue,
lietsey and Edith Lemmert do well.

NEW DEMOCRATIC
EXECUTIVE BODY
Two British vessels arrived from Ger
.mar ports yesterday. Both carried a con
siderable quantity of cement in their car
goes and that article will be a drug in the
market for some time to come.
The Manydown mr;do the run from Ham
burg to San Francisco in 149 days. Off the
River Platte she was caught in an elec
trical storm and for a time the sailors
on watch were quaking in their shoes.
On March 21 it began to storm again and
the tempest gradually worked up until the
Manydown was in dire distress. The ele
ments seemed to be at war and the firma
ment was ablaze. Flash after flash of
sheet lightning lit up the scene while
forked lightning made it very uncomfort
able for the men handling the sails.
The Manydown finally escaped the elec
trical storms off the Platte and then ran
into heavy weather off the Horn. For
days at a time the decks were never free
from water and during the conflict every
thing movable on deck was washed over
board. Once the Horn was rounded every
thing was plain sailing and the Many
down made good time to port.
The bark Lord Elgin had an almost s:m
ilar experience on her voyage here. Sh*.
was 154 days from Antwerp and in the
North Sea and British Channel ran into
a succession of westerly gales. She and
the Manydown must have been off the
Platte together, because the thunder and
lightning that played around the bark
while she was in that vicinity almost
scared the sailors to death and the officers
had a hard time of it keeping them at
their posts.
Off the Horn the Lord Elgin encoun
tered a succession of gales that delayed
her fourteen days. The Manydown went
further south, escaped the heavy weather
and beat her rival live Jays on the voy
age.
In the Manydown's cargo is a lot of
crucibles and hollow glassware for the
University of California. A few small
consignments of Keneral merchandise and
thousands of barrels of cement make up
the rest of her load. The l^ord Elgin's
cargo is all Geneva gin and cement.
Excursions on the Bay.
The steamer Resolute took a lot of
newspapermen and their friends on an ex
cursion around the bay yesterday. The
vessel has been recently fixed up by the
Piper-Aden-Goodall Company and is now
the finest of her class on the bay. Yes
terday was really her trial trip, and
through the courtesy of A: E. Pryor she
was turned over to newspapermen. It
was a most enjoyable affair. The party
left the Clay-street wharf about 10:30 a.
m. and made a tour of the bay. Then the
Resolute was headed for McN'ear's land
ing, and there all hands went ashore and
had a pleasant afternoon. A band accom
panied the party and Oanclng was the
order of the day.
Mark Devlne of the wharfinger's office,
with James S. Tyler and John J. Har
rison, representing the newspaper men,
conducted' the affair, which was success
ful from every point of view. The Press
Club wns well represented.
The Hunker Hill Association continued
its celebration yesterday. The members
nnd their friends went out for a trip
around the bay on the river steamer
Dauntless and thoroughly enjoyed them
fcIws. ThÂ» Union Iron Works, Hunters
Point. El Campo and all points of inter
est were taken in and everybody returned
borne thoroughly satisfied with the out-
Ing.
In honor of Punker Hill Day Henry
Peterson erected his new 109-foot flag pole
at the foot of Folsom street yesterday.
After working hard on the job from sun
rise Mr. Peterson pot *he immense pole
In place by noon an" the flag was flying

the proper hour. Charley Rodgers, who
has assisted in driving nearly every pile

excursionists.
Czarina in Port.
The steamer Czarina arrived from Hon
olulu yesterday. Captain Seaman had
considerable trouble with tho qunranttne
officers, as they would not allow his ves
sel to coir.e within a fathom of tho wharf
rind that made discharging very difficult.
The receiving of rer FUgar cargo wns
from lighters, so :he delay on that em!
was not prpat.

Two British Vessels Caught
in Electrical Storms Off
the Platte.
Two MiPfion toughs. Andrew Flatc'y
and John Wright, are in the City Prison
charged with assault to commit murder
and robbery. The complaining witness
against them Is John C. Nolan, a gar
dener living at 131 Ivy ave:iue
Nolan is a married man. and. not being
aMe to obtain work la the city, he start
ed out late Saturday night to walk to
San Jose to pet a iob picking fruit. When
he reached Thirtieth and Mission streets
he went \ip to Policeman James F\
Dennan, who was talking to Flately and
Wright, csked him to direct him to ; the
San Jose road, Dennan instructed him
how to proceed, and he continued his
tramp. Flate-ly and Wright left Dennan
and followed Nolan.
About 3:30 o'clock yesterday morning
Kolan met Dennan at Twenty-ninth and
iMission streets, and told him he had been
stabbed and robbed of $2 by two young
iren near Ii-lals Creek. Dennan summon
ed the patrol wagon, and Nolan was
taken to the City and County Hospital.
Dr. Boskowltz found a long knife wound
on the right eide of Nolan s fa^v which
required ten stitches, and another slash
in the back of his head, requiring five
etltches. There were also contusions on
the left side of the man's head and face.
After his wounds were stitched and dress
ed he was ta&en to the Seventeenth-street
police station.
In the meantime Dennan and Sergeant
Shaw and Policeman Winters went in
search of Flately and Wright. They were
found at their homes, the first named on
Ney street and the last named on Paris
Etreet. They were taken to the Seven
teenth-street station, and when thev en
tered Nolan ai once identified them. They
â¢were booked on charges of assault to
commit murder and robbery, and were
pent to the City Prison. Nolan was taken
to his home in the patrol wagon,
Whf-n the prisoners were searched a
ca5Â«Â» containing a hypodermic syringe and
needle, besides a comb, knife, pencil and
mining: circular, were found in Wrights
pockets, which Nolan identified as his
property, and the articles were kept as
(evidence.
Â¦ "The two young men came up to me,"
raid Nolan, "and we walked along to
pcthcr till we came to the creek at the
fr>ot of the hill. They stopped, and
Fiately pulled out a knife and ordered
me to throw up my hands. I did so. and
W right went through my pockets.
Flately got mad because I had only $2.
j-nd cut me with the knife. When I fell
I was struck on the head with a rock
nr.d kicked by both the young men. Alter
they left me I retraced my steps until I
mÂ«-t the policeman."
Flately rind Wrieht both deny that they
Â¦were talking to Policeman Dennan, and
know nothing of the robbery. Wright ex
plained his possession of the hypodermic
outfit and other articles by s-ving that
Flatr-3y put them in his pockots while
ho was fitting on tho steps of a drug
store.
Both nrlsonrr?! are wcil known to the
police. Plate! jr was arrested April 21 for
Ftabbinf James Rowan on the Mission
road. He claimed that Rowan and two
â¢ iThers "jun-.p^.r* him. and he had to use
his Vr.ife ii sHfWWon.se. On that show

the couple accepted an invitation to spend
the night at the home of a neighbor of
the Hamlins. Thl3 morning they went t"
their homes.
"It was a protty â¢ rarrow escape for
them." said Ralph Hamlin to-dav. "When
I got to their boat it was half full of wa

more to have sunk it The young lady
had lost her hat and cape and was soak

that hour. I looked at my clock and it

the happiest pair you ever saw when tl-.py

The boat in which the couple spent so
many hours in terror of going to the bot

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. June IT.
The spectacle of two prominent young
clergymen of Alameda County soundly
pummellng a stalwart ranch hand on
the streets of Livermore was witnessed
yesterday, much to the edification of a
crowd of sisjht-secrs, who cheered the
plucky young clerics.
The muscular expounders of the gospel
are Rev. Carl M. Warner, pastor of tho
Methodist Church, and Rev. Arthur
Hicks, pastor of the Presbyterian flock at
Livermore. Each is a believer in mus
cular Christianity when force can be ap
plied to a righteous cause. In the case
in point the two preachers went to the
rescue of Town Marshal Harvey, who
was beinj? badly worsted in an effort to
lug a belligerent and somewhat inebriated
farm hand to the calaboose.
The rancher was making matters so hot
for Harvey that the peace otScer wa,-*
well nifjh ready to loose hla prisoner,
when the youncr ministers came aions
They wer not long in taking in the situ
ation. Harvey is not a large mnn. Tho
prisoner with whom he was struÂ»;;linsr
was not only big framed, but sufflciently
heated by liquor to make a mean and
uply fisrht.
The farmer had much thf best of the
f.pht until he was confronted by the
clerical reinforcements. Rev. Mr. War
ner and his companion doffed their coats
and went Into the affray. To be a min
ister is not to bo any less but much more
a man with such sturdy followers of thÂ«Â»
cross of faith, so they had everything
their own way.
In a jiffy the tide of battle had turned,
and the pastors had the satisfaction of
seeing the fighting rancher speedily
placed in jail, with ample room trÂ» medi
tate upon the vanities of the world.
"It was rnifhintr." said licv. Mr. War
ner. "The Marshal seem**! to have hU
hands full, find we relieved him of soma
of his burdens." .

Mistakes.
It is a great mistake to set up our
standard of right or wrong and judge peo
ple accordingly.
To measure the enjoyment of others by
our own.
To expect uniformity of opinion in this
world.
To endeavor to mold all dispositions
alike, Â¦w,^.
Not to yield to immaterial trifles.
To look for perfection in our own ac
tions.
To worry ourselves and others with
what cannot be remedied.
Not to make allowances for the infirm
ities of others. .
To consider everything impossible which
we cannot perform.â Buffalo Times.

LOS ANGELES FEARFUL â¢
OF THE DREAD PLAGUE
The Federal quarantine Inspector was
to-day prevented from molesting passen

and his authority Is ignored by the rail
road officials. Orders were issued to all
conductors to take up the pass of the
inspector, Mr. Jenkins, if presented, and
collect fare. Jenkins wired Surgeon Kin
youn for Instructions. The conductors
were also ordered ,to give the Inspector no
Information. r "..'.->
NEEDLES, Cal., June 17.â Last night
the quarantine Inspector met the Santa
Fe east-bound train at Bannock, a few
miles west of Needles. There were eight

ignored by the conductor. The inspector
went with the train to the State line and
served the notice on each passenger. This
was also Ignored.

Health Officer Dr. L. M. Powers gave It

demonstrated In the language used In the

"We have been satisfied for some time
that the plague does exist in San Fran

selves in a foolish attitude by saying It
does If the contrary were true. We have
no right to question what Information
they give our board, as they are on the.
ground and can Intelligently determine
the seriousness of the situation."

this board would quarantine, against San

through the mummery because a certifi

ticket.
During the day a large number of peo

Kinyoun refused to see a Call reporter
yesterday, and all efforts to Interview

He spent most of 'the day at the ferry
"bureau," where a great showing was
made of epauletted doctors and uniformed

that Kinyoun desired that they be placed
on the secret file because of the "hostile

Five days after making his first an
nouncement to Washington of a "suspi
cious case" he wired the Surgeon General
that "completed examination demon
strates plague," whereas, the highest au
thorities declare that it is impossible to
prove anything definite for at least eight
days after the experiments are under
taken.
The whole tenor of Klnyoun's dispatches
to Washington on thr> "plague" show that
he was careless of the State's interests
and ever mindful of his own. His mess
ages were all of the most alarmist type
and calculated to give his superiors the
impression that the situation here was
moFt alarming, but that he could handle
It if "funds" and men were provided. He
even went so far as to declare on May 15
that the plague was "epidemic," while
even the local Board of Health, with all
Its massive front of nerve, has never even
hinted at such a thing.
Sent Alarmist Telegrams.
Attorney Shortridge spent most of the
day in preparing his case. Governor Gage
was frequently in consultation with him.
No messages were received from Wash
ington, but official messages were scarce
ly expected because it was Sunday. It
will be shown in court that Klnyoun's
action in placing- a quarantine on tho
State was plainly malicious and taken
because his efforts to place a blight upon
the city by "discovering" bubonic plague
were disregarded by laymen and courts
alike.
Attorney Frank L. Coombs advised tvin- |
youn not to quarantine the State is pretty
well authenticated by ihÂ«; highest author
ity. It may lead to serious complications
to*-day. It is understood that Attorney
Shortridpe, who will reprf-sent the Chinese
in the case, will cali District Attorney
Coombs t>> the witness-stand and question
him as to what advice h<Â» did give Kin
youn. It is probable that Mr. Coombs will
refuse to answer the Question on the
ground of privileged communication be
iween lav.-ye_r and client. Mr. Shortrldge
is prepared to combat this by showing .
that, under the law, Mr. Coombs and Kin- |
youn. being public officials, their eommu- j
nicationp- may be made public for the I
public welfare. If the court holds that j
Mr. Coombs must unseal his lips some

now be dead, and the plague would have
been epidemic beyond the question of a
doubt and beyond control.
It is related that a member of the State
Board of Health, directed by the Gov
ernor to secure glands from the bodies oi
'â¢suspects" and to preserve them until
further orders, carried a bucketful of the
alleged infected glands through the
streets and even In a crowded street car.
When the Governor protested against his
action, the doctor assured him that dis
infected cotton had been placed on a cov
ering over the bucket.
Would Cause an Epidemic.
Worse than that, the same doctor in
preparing the glands for examination as
sured the Governor that he had "washed
them free from blood in a basin and had
seen that the blood and washings went
safely into the sink." Had this been
plague the best authorities would say
that such an epidemic would now be rag
ing in San Francisco tha,t the people
would appeal for Federal aid..
What people cannot understand is that
when a matter of such vital importance
to the whole country Is at stake Kinyoun
has not asked the surgeon "oneral to
send here the best bacteriologists in the
country. Three months have elapsed
since he sent his first report to Washing
ton concerning the "epidemic." and yet
he sets himself up as the supreme au
thority on the subject and defies the au
thority of the Federal courts. People are
beginning to ask, "Is he afraid to have
his work inspected and criticized by men
of standing in the medical world?"
Governor Gage has called attention to
another Important point. Right along
Kinyoun and others have had. in their
possession cultures of bubonic plague
bacilli which were imported from plague
countries. . Two years ago some similar
cultures got loose in a Vienna college of
medicine and killed several people before
they could be stamped out. Perhaps some
inadvertently got loose in Klnyoun's bu
bonic pig pen. Governor Gage thinks that
there ought to be a rigid law against the
Importation of cultures of plague, or any
other disease, except under the direct su
pervision of a special State bureau.
Judge Carpenter, one of the Southern
Pacific Company's attorneys, got Into an
argument in the PalaiJe Hotel corridor
yesterday with Dr. Huntington. who un
dertook to defend the position of the local
Board of Health. Both men became ex
cited and ppoke in loud tones. The doctor
finally asserted that If the Federal court
decided against Kinyoun again to-day it
would be more than likely that every
State in the Union would quarantine
against California in twenty-four hours.
"if such is the case." replied' Judge Car
penter, with great vehemence, "look out
for a vigilance committee. â¢ It Is high time
that this high-handed outrage was put
an end to." . -

Early Sunday morning National Commit

California delegation and was accorded a
hearty reception by each and all of the
members. Mr. Spreckels was the first to
impart to the members of the delegation
the, news of the quarantining of Califor

people of California and Mr. Knight was
Immediately requested to call a meeting

SANTA CLARA FRUIT

As far as can officially be learned Los
Angeles railroad managers will not pay
any attention to the order requiring bills
of health from those intending to leave
the. State. Â» In consequence all outbound
trains-last night and to-night carried the
usual number of passengers. The travel
to San Francisco has not In the least been
interrupted.
The Health Board visited Chinatown to
day and lively scenes ensued, as attempts
were made to explain to the Celestials the
need for cleaning up. To-morrow the City
Council and the health officers will visit
the same district.
"Out of the wilderness of conflicting re
ports that come from San Francisco re
garding- the existence of the plague it is
difficult to arrive at a just conclusion. We
must be governed by what official reports
are made, and these say it does exist. On
that presumption we are cleaning up Chi

resort will be made to drastic measures
unless the situation grows worse, and
then our official action will alone be gov

that is being done at Mojave and Bakers

may be twenty-four hours from now, and
should they become wo^se and It becomes
evident that self-protection demands such
a course a quarantine that means what
the word implies may be declared."
Dr. Powers added that the authorities
were determined to prepare for any con

Health Board that will be held to-morrow
the entire question and what action may
be taken will be fully discussed.

FRUIT GROWERS CONDEMN
KINYOUN'S QUARANTINE
flp^ciil Di^ratch to The Call.
SAN J0SF1, June 17.â Santa Clara Coun
ty fruit growers severely condemn Dr.
Kinyoun for quarantining the State, and
declare that unless this unwarranted re
striction is raised California will suffer
the loss of millions of. dollars. As it is
great injury has been done to the State
and its products. A mass-meeting of
growers has been called for to-morrow
morning to advance the interests of the
Cured* Fruit Association, and it is more
than likely the quarantine will be discuss
ed and strong resolutions condemning It
passed. It is too soon yet to tell how
the quarantine will affect the sale of green
fruit in Eastern markets, but all declare
it means loss to fruit growers, and a
heavy one, unless Dr. Kinyoun is compell
ed to abandon his outrageous action.
YV. E. Crossman, president of the Board
of Trade, says the placing of a quaran
tine on the State Is the worst thing gen
erally that could have happened to Cali
fornia. It means the loss of millions of
Â¦dollars from tourists and travelers and
great loss to our fruit growers.
A. Block of Santa Clara, a large ship
per of green fruits, denounces Dr. Kln
youn's action as an outrage. He says the
damage to Eastern fruit sales cannot be
estimated as yet, but unless quarantine
is Immediately raised all the frultmen of
California will suffer heavy loss.
. W- P. Cragin, president of the Farm
ers' Club, expressed the same opinion. He
said:
"If Eastern people get It Into their
heads that we have the plague, of which
there is much doubt, and become possess
ed of a fear that It will spread they will
not buy our fruits, and the fruit Interests
of California will suffer severely. Many
growers think the notoriety already given
the State by the Board of Health has af
fected their receipts from cherries. The
quarantine should be iaised."
Dr. Miller, president of the Board of
Health, said we had positively nothing to
fear from the disease. The fruit inter
ests of Santa Clara County will suffer a
body blow if quarantine regulations are
carried out to the letter.
Speeiil Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 17.â Major J. D.
Peters, one of the heaviest shippers of
fruit in this section, was* asked this after
noon as to the probable effect the State
quarantine will have on the fruit Inter
ests. He eald that, fortunately, the blow
had come early, and that there might
yet.be time to dftpel any prejudices the
Eastern people might feel against Call
fornia products. Apricots have been coln~
forward, but it will be some weeks beforl
the other fruits are started. While not
excusing the unwarranted action of Dr
Kinyoun he was hopeful that the dam
.age might yet be repaired.
OPINIONS OF. GROWERS
ON THE SAN JOAQUIN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, June 17.â The opinion
appears to be general among fruit grow
ersâalthough the fruit shippers may not
share It at the present time â that the
astounding action of Dr. J. J. Kinyoun
in placing a quarantine against California
will play sad havoc with California fruit
this year in the East. There seems to be
no division in the sentiment among 1 the
orchardists, who unite in condemning the
course of the Federal quarantine officer.
One of the most prominent fruit growers
In Sacramento County Is ex-Senator Wi>
liam -Johnston of Richland, on the Sac
ramento River. To The Call correspond
ent to-day Senator Johnston said:
"This quarantine is a humbug. It Is
nothing but politics. I don't believe there
ever was a case of plague in San Fran
cisco. If this thing is kept up it is goin?
to prove disastrous to the State's fruit
interests.
Another large river fruit grower owning
orchards both in Sacramento and Yolo
counties is T. B. Ivovdal. To The Call
correspondent he said to-day:
"This quarantine, for which I believe. In
common with others acquainted with the
facts, there is absolutely no necessity, is
bound to prove injurious to our fruit in
terests, since it will create in the East a
bad impression. People at a distance are
bound to get a distorted. Idea of the true
situation. It is always so, whether In the
matter of hope or of fear. When the
quarantine was on in Hawaii everybody
here was afraid of the fruit coming from
the Islands. I don't know what the ef
fect of the plague scare has been on East
ern purchasers thus far, or what it will
be. but I do know that the plague has
been used as a lever by the shippers to
Induce the growers to sell their fruit at a
lower' rate. Growers, instead of selling
outright as formerly, are obliged to Bell
on consignment this year, and the plague
scare has been advanced as the reason."
Assemblyman Morris Brooke, an or
chardist who handles considerable fruit,
said that he had just received a letter
from. a fruit grower from the river sec
tion stating that he had been obliged to
part with his fruit~at a cut price because
of the gloomy prospect held out to him
by the dealers based upon the plague
scare. Shipments of apricots were partic
ularly small since the plague bugaboo
was raised- Mr. Brooke believed that the
fruit industry would suffer by the quaran
tine." â¢ '
George B. Katzensteln, vice president
of the Earl Fruit Company, was asked
for his views. He v said that shipments
were going ahead dally and were larger
than ever before.

tificates" on any conditions. So far as

Dr. J. J. Kinyoun. Federal Quaran
tine Officer, who has abused his
authority and has overridon the orders of
the United States Circuit Court in his un
warranted attempt to ruin the commerce
of California by publishing to the world
that an epidemic of bubonic plague exists
in this city, when he lacks proof that a.
single ca?e has ever existed here. His
latest outrage in quarantining the State
is denounced by the highest authority as
malicious and vindictive. Twice checked
by the courts in his high-handed work, he
has brokt n all bounds of decency and de
lled the courts to bring him to book. To

"isobendience.
