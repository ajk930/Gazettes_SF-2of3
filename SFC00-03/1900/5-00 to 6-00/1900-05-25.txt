SLOW PROGRESS MADE
ON THE ALASKA BILL
House Adopts Amendment Permit-
ting Dredging for Gold Below
Low Water on Nome Beach.
WASHINGTON. May 24.â The House
practically devoted eight hours to-day to
the consideration of the Alaska civil gov
ernment bill, but progress was stow. Two
amendments of importance were adopted.
One of them authorized the Secretary of
War to Issue permits to excavate or
dredge for gold below low. water mark on
the beach at Cape Nome. The Secretary
has heretofore issued perrnUs, but the bill
as Â¦ It passed the Senate canceled them.
The House, also struck out the chapter
relating to arrest and ball, which permit
ted arrests in certain civil actions. The
conference report on the Indian appropri
ation bill was adopted.
RJEFORT IS READY.
WASHINGTON. May 24.â The Industrial
Commission has completed its report on
by the failure. Probably no one was in
for more than a few thousand dollars.
There has been considerable speculation in
cotton here, and also in stocks, by men of
wealth. Possibly the total loss in this city
might amount to .half a million dollars
outside of the losses of George Crocker.
The money that Mr., Crocker put Into the
firm was cleaned up on a wheat deal. .
In addition to George Crocker there was
another partner in the house who is well
known in California. This Is Walter W.
Price, formerly a' newspaper man In this
city, who," after his experience here, went
to New York and, became a clerk in the
house. Then he was made a partner. He
was a, member : of the ; Bohemian and the
Press clubs during his residence here.

to-day, with liabilities estimated
at J13.000.000. The firm Is a member
of the Stock, Cotton and Produce ex

Not an Entir; Surprise.
Early in the day rumors were current
that a prominent firm was in trouble, and
shortly before the official announcement
of the suspension was made it van Ken
era'.ly understood that Price. MeCormiek
& Co. was the house referred to. Prior
to the formal announcement the cotton
market had broken over 2) points under
terrific selling for both accounts from all
Clrf^ctJons. The firm has long been re
garded as the leading rupporter of the
market, and at one time it was said it was
going to put August cotton up to 10 cents.
The decline of the past month, however,
was against it and despite all efforts it
could not hold the market up. Conse

firm's account footed up 23,950 shares.
Anzi.otxncexn.ent by Assignees. . j
Assignees William J. Curtis and William
Nelson Cromwell make the following an
nouncement regarding the failure:
To the creditors of PrlcÂ«Â», McCormick & Co.:
Price, McConnlck & Co. have been compelled
to temporarily Buspend payment. We ask and
advise that creditors holding stocks, bonds and
other collateral to loans and already well
margined hold The loans until reasonable op
portunity be afforded the assignees to deal
with the same, that unnecessary loss thereby
may be avoided.
Price, McCormick & Co. had an exten
sive wire service and at times were cred
ited with doing- fully as large a business
as any firm on the Exchange. The repre
sentatives of the firm on the Exchange
were R. M. Stewart-Wortley, W. C. Mc-
Cormick and Gorge Crocker, the special
partner. Most of the business of the firm
was in the Cotton Exchange at first and
its senior member and organizer was for
merly of the firm of Hubbard, Price &
Co." At that time the older firm had a
large Southern business. The present firm
controlled much of. this Southern stock
business and. has been very active at
times in stocks favored by Southern ope
rators, although this line of trade has
been far less in volume than Its regular
commission business obtained through its
wire service to outside cities.

BOER REPORT OF THE

Â£\Â£r Jaubert on March 11. eight days
M If before his death, wrote a letter
MM to George W. Van Siclen of this
city, in which he said:
Our small but noble Christian people are at
present in a very straitened and. I may Â«ay,
miserable and dark condition. Driven to war
âand. I may as well say. a ruinous warâ by tha
presumptuous and cverpotverlnx English Gov
ernment, to small number of Cghtlns men,
with few jruns tr.J little ammunition, did
wonders with God's help against a vastly
greater force; but the superiority of England,
by -which that power can furnish against our
two, three or four cannon twenty, forty or even
more and thousands of men against our hun
dred or two hundred, is such that any one can
already foretell, according to human nature,
what the result must and will be after thou
sands of brave English soldiers and hundreds
of valiant English officers havÂ« been killed
by us or taken prisoners ; that we yet in the
end will be compelled to yield before a fore*
of 1SO.0OO soldiers, with our three or four
thousand. v
And now our God' who rules heaven and
earth, has made many nations great upon
earth. Among those also is the great Ameri
can republic, the Tnlted States of America.
These powers are great. They naturally have
no necessity to yield to Eneland. The only
small Christian States upon earth are the Or
ange Free State and the Transvaal and they
will now not only be checked la their develop
ment, but will be swept from the world and
annihilated by the English overpowering force,
if it U God 1 * will, and this under the eyes
of great nations an.1 without their sympathy.
Must h be so? Why la it. then, that our
God save power and dominion to these great
nations? And how ihail their rulers answer
In the day of Judgment to the Almighty Gov
ernor and Disposer la regard to their rule- of
the nations?
Where stands the arreat American republic In
this matter? Shall it be the mean* in. God's

success and that .*our Government shall un
this opportunity tÂ» make Itself highly worthy
of Its vocation, to become a glory and a bless

prosperity not only to the great state of
America but also to her little sisters In South

LONDON. May 24 â At a "stop the war"

asked if It was any good attempting to

said, he replied it was useless to do so

their Independence. So the delegates pro

The railway has not been damaged to

fended the Free Staters by destroying
th?!r splendid bridges when retiring to
Kroonstad. They refrained from doing
this on the retreat to Rhenoster. but now
they are destroying the railroad and
bridges almost completely north of Rhe

Boer telegrams say that SOCK) British with
ten guns are rear Vreedefort, which Is
close to the Vaal ar.d close to Parys. One
correspondent refers to the advance as a
"promenade." Another describes it as a
"Boer hunt." The Free Staters are pic
tured as "bolting like hares at the first
Eight cf the British." The latter, accord
ing to the writer, do not find even women
and children, as the fleeing farmers take
their families with them in consequence
of the reports current among the Trans
vaalers that the British kidnap all chil

What the Boers are doing is an absolute
mystery. The embargo of news out of
LONDON, May 25.â The Lourenzo Marques corre
spondent of the Times, telegraphing Wednesday, says:
"According to a private letter smuggled through from
Pretoria Fresident Kruger now favors surrender on the
ground that a continuance of the war would ruin the
property of the burghers. He has thrown upon the
commandants the onus of what course to pursue.
Civilian prisoners released at Pretoria report extraor
dinary activity during the last two weeks on the railway
from Pretoria to Petersburg. As many as twenty trains
are running daily and it is possible that a large portion
have been used to move supplies northward for safety."

further than that the movement toward

dum on the question of continuing the war
Is going on among the Boer fighting- men.
It may be a fortnight, before, the results

ROME, May -24.-r-There was a magnifi
cent spectacle in St. Peter's to-day upon
the occasion of the canonization of Jean
Baptiste de la Salle, the founder of the
order of the Christian Brothers, and Rita
di Cascia, a nun of the Augustinlan order.
The interior of the vast basilica was il
luminated and adorned with' magnificent
hangings and the building was rilled with
a great concourse of people, including all
the pontifical dignitaries, diplomats and
the Roman nobility. Of the 60,000 specta
tors about 30,000 were foreign' pilgrims.
Italian troops kept order in the square In
front of St. Peters, while the pontifical
body-guard was stationed within the
cathedral.
Pope Leo, attired In his state robes, was
borne on tho sodia gestatoria at the head
of an imposing procession, composed of
the entire papal court, 300" patriarchs,
Archbishops. Bishops and four Cardinals.
A roar of cheering rose from the multi
tude on the Pope's appearance, but the
applause was quickly hushed by tho
guards.
When the cortege reached the choir, the
Pope alighted from the sedia gestatoria.
took his seat on the pontifical throne ajid
the Cardinals and other ecclesiastics
massed around him. The solemn cere
mony of canonization was then proceeded
with.
The Pontiff, -after the usual prayers, pro
nounced the canonization and iintertoned
the "To Deum." At that moment the hells
in all the churches in Rome rang out, and
the Pope solemnly blessed the congrega
tion and returned to the Vatican .arriid
prolonged cheering of Ihe very large audi
ence. . Â¦ ,i . Â¦ . . t , . :
Two unpleasant incidents occurred. An
Italian pilgrim suffered from a slight
stroke of apoplpxy at tho entrance of tho
cathedral and t ubsenuently died in a hos
pital, and a" portion of a glass chandelier
inside the basilica fell, slightly injuring
a French woman.
WASHINGTON. May 24.â The canoniza
tion of the founder of the Christian Broth
ers, Jean Baptisto de la Salle. at Rome
to-day was observed by the colleges of
Washington and Baltimore by reason of
the fact that tho fir?t foundation of the
order in the United States was made in
this diocese fifty-two years apo. A num
ber of brothers from Ammondale,' near
this- city, where the American novitiate of
the order 'stands, were participants in the
rites at Rome. The principal delegate
from America was the provincial of the
Baltimore* province, Brother Christian,
whose connection with . this coirimunity
covers many years. ''"
At the august ceremonial to-day De la
Salle passed from the state of "beatifica
tion." already accorded him, to the crown
inc glory of ".sainthood." Henceforth ho
will receive the honors of the altar, and it
Is expected that many new churches will
be placed under his patronage. A pleas
ant feature of the festivities was the pres
ence of the flower of the brotherhood from
every clime, headed by La fiallfi's latest
successor at Paris. Brother Gabriel-Marie,
whose recent edict against members
teaching the classics In their colleges
caused so much criticism that the Ameri

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. XEW YORK, May 24.â Articles of
agreement were signed to-night by Jef
fries and Sharkey calling for a twenty
tive round bout for the championship of
the world, to take place on or about Au
gust 23 before the club offering the largest
financial Inducement. Before the articles
were signed "Tom" O'Rourke. represent
ing Sharkey, and William A. Brady, ap
pearing .for Jeffries, met at the Delavan
House and arranged the conditions to
govern 'the battle. It was. agreed that the
men should right with one hand free and
protect themselves in tne- breakaway.
They can hit in clinches until ordered to
break by the referee. Neither man . will
be permitted to wear bandages on' his
hands during the fight. Each principal
will post to-morrow a forfeit of J250O.
Bids lor the contest will close with "Al"
Smith on July 1. Each bid must be ac
companied by a forfeit of $5000. This sum
is exacted from clubs to insure fulfillment
of their contract with the principals and
is to be equally divided between the prin
cipals in the event of the club being un
able to carry out its agreement.
O'Rourke, who also represents the Sea
side Sporting Club of Coney Island, said
iie wanted it plainly understood that so
far as Sharkey was concerned only bids
from lcRltlmate athletic clubs would be
considered. He said he did not want
Sharkey to go into training for a loug
period of time and then have to accept a
small forfeit and have no fight. On be
half of the Nutmeg Athletic Club of Hart
ford "Joe" Humphreys offered 66 2-3 per
cent of the gross receipts for the match.
"Jack" Rose of Bridgeport offered 75 per
cent of the gross receipts, and said he
would deposit $3000 cs forfeit that he enn
hold the tight successfully in Connecticut.
Brady named Charlie White as his
choice for referee. *>'Rourke said that
White would suit him. but before, agree
ing on the New Yorker ho desired to
consult SharKey. If Sharkey is agreeable
White will officiate.
Should McCoy defeat Sharkey In their
contest on June 25 McCoy will take the
sailor's place against Jeffries in August.
Regardless of the battle between Jeffries
and Sharkey. the champion has agreed
to box Gus Ruhlin six rounds in Chicago
in July.

"An officer who charges falsehood

Imperiled,"
"Well." replied Spooner. "if he told the
truth &â¢ court-martial would, take care of
his case and of that of the* commanding

' "The way the army is run to-day," as
serttd Allen, "it- is certain that no officer
would thus imperil his position."
"Thero- never was a. time in all the illus

Spopner warmly, "when It was better or
braver or more honorable than it is to

Allenâ The statement made by General
Otis Ls not the truth. .
"We have had here," said Spooner, "a
statement that -the President of tho

"HI say .simply that General Otis is

Our Government Fhould keep faith with them
and wtien the proper time .comes it must keep
faith with them, and we would be rejoiced if
-the Â¦ O.vernment would immediately declare
that it will turn Cuba over to its own people.

NEW YORK, May 24.â A mass meeting
to advocate "An American policy In the
Philippines" was held to-night in Cooper
Union, under the auspices of the Anti-
Imperlallst League of New York. The
speakers were George S. Boutwell of
Massachusetts, Carl Schurz and Captain
Patrick O'Farrell of Washington. Mr.
Crosby.' said in opening the meeting:
In Cuba one of our . fellow citizens from In
diana is accused of taking all the p03tÂ»l funds
he could lay his hands on. Better the Island
be robbed by Spa'n than by an American and
a friend of Senator Ueverldgre. Were Washing
ton alive to-day he would find himself more
at home in the camp of Asrulnaldo than In the
camp of Otis. "We cannot but admire the cour
age cf Aguinaldo and his men, who have been
fightlne for over a year against tremendous
odds.
In the course of his speech ex-Secretary
Boutwell said:
Of all modern history the most disgraceful
chapter is that which the American nation is
now writing. At the opening of the last third
of this century we abolished slavery In Amer
ica and at the end 6f the century we arc
making a war lor the establishment of a Â»ys
t-eni of slavery in Asia. The crimes of England
in the Sepoy war, on the upper Nile. In South
Africa are trivial offenses against justice an-!
humanity when compared with the crime of
Bubjutfating and enslaving 10,COO,000 people.
Captain O'Farrell, who stumped the
country for McKinley In 1S96. -wras very
bitter In his criticism ot the President.
Should End the "War.
The meeting adopted resolutions, which,
after setting forth that the administration
has committed a flagrant breach of faith
and most seriously discredited the pro
ression and the character of the republic
in the eyes of the world, and that the Im
perialistic policy, if persisted in. "will in
evitably bring about the overthrow of our
democratic institutions." recite the his
tory of our relations with the Filipinos
and declare that the "betrayal of our
Â«*Â¦ constl tutes one of the basest acts of
perfidy and, cruel Inhumanity ever perpe
trated by any tyrant in the history of tho
world. The resolution continues:
Jlesolved. That It 13 the plain duty of the
American people to stop the bloody war against
the Filipinos, to recognize their right and title
to freedom and independence on the same basis
on* which we havÂ»- recognized the right of th-;
Cubans amt to withdraw our armed forces from
those islands as soon as they may no longer
txÂ» needed to assist and protect the pÂ»Â»oole
thereof in yetting up and maintaining an inde
pendent iovernment.
Resolved. That th<Â» question of Imperialism
overshadows In Imrx>rtance ail other public
questions: that the approval or dtsapcrova!
of the imperialist policy pursued by the- present
administration should be the supreme issue In
the coming national election, and that all
American citizens having the good namÂ° ar.d
the be?t huerpsts of our country and th? in
tegrity and perpetuity of our free Institutions
at he-irt ahoulti unite in an earnest effort to
secure the condemnation of that policy and tfca
sternest possible rebuke of its authors anl
promoters by & decisive popular vote.

CHICAGO. May 21â This was a day of

retirement of Dr. Lewis Curts of Chi

fice considerable controversy has taken
place. Following tht general plan of uni
fication and consolidation, which has pre
vailed throughout the sessions, the con
ference to-day abolished the office of sec
retary of the Kpwcrth League and re
fused to allow another secretary for the
Sunday School Union. It did, however,
reconsider its action of a week- ago In
abolishing additional secretaries of the
various church benevolences, so far as
the Freedmen's Aid and Southern Edu
cational Societies were concerned. The
debate resulting In this action was quite
bitter at times, the race question being
brought out prominently, and once in the
discussion one angry delegate accused an
other of uttering a falsehood. The con
vention at this became involved In ap
parently hopeless parliamentary tangles
and Presiding Bishop Ninde. In the after
noon session, admonished the delegates
not to turn the conference Into a debating
society. The General Conference voted to
adjourn sine die at 12:30 p. m. Tuesday
next.
At the afternoon session In Studebaker
Hall, the result of the ballot for book
agents of the Eastern and Western book
concerns was announced. Homer Eaton
and George P. Mains were re-elected to
the New York office. Over the Western
agents, however, there was a contest
which finally resulted In the re-e}ection
to the Cincinnati office of A. C. Jennings
and the election to the Chicago office of

REPRESENTATIVE sportsmen from
every section of the State met yes
terday morning in the rooms of the
. Olympic Gun Club to suggest legis
lation for the protection of the deer, tish
and game birds which are In danger of
being wiped out by market hunters and
others If the latter are . not stopped in
their slaughter. The problem. is one dif
ficult of solution, owing to the varying
conditions of climate and altitude within
the borders of the State. It is deemed im
practicable to fix an exact limit within
which birds may be killed. Between cer
tain dates all the birds may be in the
north and the men of the southland would
thus be deprived of their rlgrftful shoot
ing.
The general idea of the delegates is ap
parently to provide by State laws a long
open season covering several months. In
corporated with this they would have a
separate law for each county, allowing
but sixty days' shooting on each kind of
game. Thus the county laws would ac
commodate themselves to the proper time
when certain game could be taken.
A difference of opinion developed yester
day upon but one subject.- .This was the
advisability of forming a State Fish and
Game Protective Association to perpetu
ate the work of the convention upon its
adjournment. The opponents "of the Idea
held that county associations, the mem
bers of which understand their conditions
and requirements, were the proper bodies
through which this work should be done.
The proponents said there must be some
central governing body and this was the
one needed . by sportsmen. â¢ After a
lengthy discussion the matter was finally
brought to a vote to lay on the table.
This motion was lost by a vote of 22 to 17.
Chairman Hughes then appointed the fol
lowing committee of five to draft a con
stitution and by-laws for the proposed
State organization: Dr. A. M. Barker,
S. C. St. John, T. II. Burkey, J. Homer
Fritch and Byron Naylor.
The convention waa called to order by
President Alex T. Vogelsang of the Cali
fornia State Fish Commission. lie ex
plained the necessity of the convention
and of intelligent legislation to protect
the fish. and game of the State from the
depredations of irresponsible shooters and
iisnermen. There are many county or
dinances which conflict with State laws,
and It Is to reconcile these that the con
vention was called. Among the suggested
changes offered by the Fish Commission
were : â¢
Limit on the number of game birds to
be killed in one day; shorter open season:
shorter season for deer and a limit on the
number to be killed by one person: pro
tection for snipe, plover, curlew and other
birds, both game and Insectivorous, not
now protected; absolute prohibition of
night shooting and netting of ducks; pro
hibition of sale of grouse and mountain
quail: trout weighing less than one pound
and the catching of steelhead trout in tide
water during the close season' on trout.
.It was also suggested that no pheasants
be killed for five years and that legisla
tion be enacted expressly charging all
peace officers with the duty of enforcing
the game law.
The convention then organized bv the
election of Judge J. W. Hughes of Sacra
mento as chairman, A. D. Jordan of. San
Diego vice chairman and Andrew Fer
guson of Fresno secretary. The appoint
ment of two committeesâ those on creden
tials and permanent organizationâcom

tees were:

It was Intended originally to make the
committee on resolutions consist of five
men. Delegate Sherwood moved that It
be increased to fifteen, as It was by far
the most important committee, bearing
the brunt of the convention's work. Mr.
Vogelsang spoke In the same strain and
the motion was adopted, the report of the
committee being then adopted as a whole.
Chairman Hughes then announced the
committees as follows:
"Several months prior to the death of
my wife she was treated by Dr. Agnes
Wilcox. a cancer specialist Her treat
ment failed and I called In Dr. Peter
Kearney. Despite his efforts she died, as
I understand, from stomach troubles
presumably caused by a cancerous
growth. We buried her in the little grave
where she now rests, never thinking that
nny one would conspire to steal her re
mains. It was as sad a blow to us to
hear -of the attempted robberv of her
grave as was her death. However, I hopÂ©
that the police will arrest the despicable
scoundrels, and I will see that they are
properly punished if they are caught."
"I cannot understand why they should
want the body of my dead wife In prefer
ence to the many that lie in the several
cemeteries of San Francisco. After the
attempted robbery was reported to me -I
went to the cemetery and stood guard
over the grave, contldently expecting that
they would return and make a second at
tempt to steal the body. After several
rights of lonely vigil they failed to re
appear and I concluded that they had
abandoned any further attempt to rob
the grave. Had they shown up while I
was watching there would be another
story to tell. The cemetery officials are
making an investigation, and I sincerely
trust that they will succeed in locating
the scoundrels.
The husband of the dead woman Is
greatly Incensed over . the affair. When
seen last night at his home. 635 Bryant
street., he said: i ... , -
proceed to dig open the grave. One man
carried a lantern, and by its dim rays
directed the efforts of his companions.
The failure of the robbers to secure the
body, it is thought, was due to a special
ofllcer, who is employed to patrol the
cemetery after dusk. It is presumed he
happened to be walking in the immediate
vicinity of the attempted grave robbery
when the ghouls espied him just as their
spades had reached the coffin and aban
doned their task. *â¢ Â¦ â¢â¢
Â¦ perpetrators of the outrage were a spade, i
which had evidently been used in reopen- â¢
ing the prave.and a well-worn slouch hat, i
which were found near by. It is thought !
j both wore dropped by the unsuccessful
J grave robbers In their hasty flight. Wagon
tracks were plainly discernible about I
fifteen yards from the grave, showing j
that the ghoula were fully prepared to
get away with the body.
Nolan, after completing his investiga
tion, notified the relatives of the dead
woman.
The husband of Mrs. Murphy was hor
rified on seeing the condition of the grave.
j He naturally could give no explanation
! of why an attempt shoul.l be made to
j Fteal his wife's body, other than that it
I was the work of medical students, who
I knew of the cause of death and were
! anxious to get possession of the body for
dissection. Since then he has stood guard
over the grave, hoping that the ghouls
; would return and make a second attempt
(o secure the remains.
As soon as the matter was reported to
i the officers of the Calvary Cemetery As
i sociatlon they communicated the facts to
! the police and requested that a thorough I
; investigation be made. Chief -Sullivan
| promptly detailed two of his best men on
| the case, but thus far they have been un
i able to lo<;ate the perpetrators. *
Seen Near, ths Grave. /
I Three men, all of whom wore overcoats .
' buttoned up to their chins, were seen act- j
ing suspiciously in the vicinity of the "j
; cemetery on the night that the attempt
! was made to steal the body. They were
J seated in a light cart and were seen to
: drive along the cemetery fence on the
south side. As the grave is only a few
i yards from the fence they could alight
I from the cart and enter the inclosure
, with little fear of being discovered. A
| citizen, whose name the police refuse to
= divulge, says he saw the men alight from
| the cart and after vaulting over the fence ]
IÂ«eft a Spade Behind.
On vlsitlns the ppot Nolan made a care-
Tul examination, but the only clew to the
C; HAVE robbers have made their ap- â¢
â pcarance in Calvary Cemetery.
/] Some time before midnight Mon
day throe men for whom the police j
are anxiously searching visited the burial I
ground and .made a determined attempt
\r. steal the body of Mrs. Margaret Mur
1'hy. whose earthly remains lie under an
unpretentious mound in a remote portion
of the graveyard. After removing the
earth that hid the coffin from view the
ghouls evidently became frightened and
hurriedly departed without having ac
c-'mplishr-d their base purpose.
Mrs. Murphy died one we^k ago ye9-*i
t< rday from a cancerous gTowth of the 1
Ftnmach. She had been attended by two j
doctors, but their skill failed to save her j
life.
Two days later mourner? accompanied j
the remains to Calvary Cemetery, where
they fffre interred. Thp following Sun- '
day relatives of the dead woman visited i
the cemetery and decorated the grave j
with flowers. At that time there was |
r."thing to indicate that a bold attempt j
was about to be made to rob the grave |
of its occupant.
Shortly after S o'clock Tuesday morn- |
ing Thomas Gap^n was walking thmugh
the cemetery, where he is employed when '
li*' discovered that the grave containing I
the remains of Mrs. Murphy had been
Â¦tampered with. The *-arth covering the j
cuffln had been re- moved, f-xpoeing to view
the rough woodt-n \>ox in which It was !
inclosed. Realizing that a bold at- Â¦
tfmpt had been made to steal the body
<Jagen lO5t no time in notifying Assistant ;
Superintendent Nolan.

For the Belmont the Featherstone pair,
Mesmerist and Missionary, were at 1 to 2
In the betting, with Ildrim a, good second
choice and the others only nibbled at.
Petruchio was first off, but Maher took
Mesmerist to the front at once. They
were strung out on the back stretch, run
ning the quarter in 25 2-5 seconds, the
three furlongs in 38 seconds and the half
in 612-5 seconds, not very fast time. Mes
merist was leading as they went past the
stand, two lengths In front of Gulden, who
was half a length in front of Standing.
The next two furlongs were run In 14 sec
onds each. Then the pace began to quicken
and Mesmerist was about ready to give
up.
As they were straightened out for home
everybody was driving down the big dip
to the finish. O'Connor got to work with
a will on Missionary and the game Han
over colt responded at once. As they
swung into the last furlong he poked' his
nose in front of Ildrim. The trio of lead
ers were right together a sixteenth from
home and O'Connor faltered in his driving
for an instant. That Instant was fatal,
for In the twinkling of an eye Ildrim and
Petruchio passed him, with the wire but

Auditor "Wells took the preliminary
rteijs yesterday to prevent Assessor Dodge
and Ciiy TrÂ«aso:rpr Brooks from setting
aside from the city funds the commissions
on collateral Inheritance taxes and poll
taxes. It is believed by the Auditor that
a tacit agreement has been entered Into
by Brocks and Dodge to test the matter
In the courts as to whether they are enti
tled, respectively, to the commission of 5
per cent on the collection of collateral in
heritance taxes and the 15 per cent on poll
tax collections. The Auditor has sent the
following communication to the Board of
Supervisors regarding: the matter:
_ . TJr SAX FRANCISCO. Maj- 14, 1900.
*o tbe Honorable the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San FranciscoâOen
t>men: I have been informed through my
deputy that S. H. Urooke. Treasurer of the
c.ty and county of San Francisco, has pet
aside from city and county funds the com
m^aatons on collateral Inheritance taxes, and
tnat he Intends to retain same until ordered
ry court to deposit easiÂ« Into city and county
lunas.
I am also informed through Mr. Brooks that
Asffssor Dodge Intends to pursue the same
course In re poll tax commissions. In oonse
quenoe of the above declaration I would re
epectfUily suceest that some action be taken
recardir.ff the above.
ASA R. WELLS, Auditor.
T*he whole question arises over the dif
ference in the provisions of the State law
and the charter regarding commissions,
and it is thought that a court decision
vlll be necessary to determine the ques
tion. The State law provides that the
commission of 15 per cent for collecting
poll tax shall be retained by the Assessor,
and 5 rÂ»er ce ht of the collections of Inher
itance taxes shall be kept by the Treas
urer. The charter, however, provides
specifically that all fees Collected by city
t)liicia.ls shall be turned into the city treas*
ury. and that the salary of said officials
Fhall be deemed full compensation for
their services. The poll tax commissions
this year will amount to about $15,000, and
en the Inheritance taxes $2500 would be due
the Treasurer as commissions under the
State law.
Assessor Dodge denies that he has en
tered into any agreement to determine if
the State law is paramount to the char
ter regarding commissions. He haa turned
over the commissions as fast as he has
collected them, and he has had no conver
sation with Brooks regarding the' matter
until he heard that Auditor Wells had in
formed the Supervisors that the Assessor
Intended to retain the commissions.
Treasurer Brocks states that he has set
aside the commissions on inheritance
taxes as a special deposit until such time
as a decision of court shall compel him
to turn them over to the State. He de
clares that In any event the city would
not be entitled to the commissions. They
would be turned over to the State. Brooks
has until May 31 to make a settlement,
jind the comiriiFsions may be retained un
til the court decision ia received.

Suit was filed yesterday by the Laurel
Hill Cemetery Association to restrain the
Board of Supervisors from enforcing the
provisions of ordinance 24, which prohibits
the burial of bodies within the limits of
the city and county on or after August
1. 1901. The suit is based solely on con
stitutional questions. It is contended. that
as tho plaintiff corporation was organized
under an act of the Legislature of 1867
matters -affecting Its status are outside
the Jurisdiction of the city and county.
It Is further contended that the closing

An attempt to evade the payment of 1
cent toll on the Berks and Dauphin turn
pike has just cost a rich Pennsylvanian
cattle dealer $10.
From all parts of the State comes the
intelligence that more hands are required
to handle the fruit crop and make ready
for the gathering of the harvest. But
there appears to be a dearth of white la
bor and the husbandmen are confronted
with the necessity of looking elsewhere
for help to save their ripe fruit crops or
suffer a whole year's loss. This the fruit
growers are doing by sending their orders
to the agents of the Japanese employment
offices In this city. Heretofore this line
of labor was given to the Chinese, but
now the little brown men have taken the
places that once were filled by the moon
eyed coclles.
One of the principal reasons why the
Jap Is sought In preference to the Chinese
Is that when the fruit grower is compelled
to replace his white brother by Mongo
lian hands he seeks the cheapest help he
can find, and the Japanese is willing to
work for whatever his employer is will
ing to pay him. while the Chinese de
mands higher wages.
The present rate of wages paid to Jap
anese fruit pickers ranges from 90 cents
to $1 a day. they finding themselves. The
Chinese demand $1 25 and $1 50 a day and
find themselves. To the white man the
present rate of wages offered is $1 25 and
found, but this rate is jumping upward
and will, it is thought, go as high as $1 50
before the harvest is gathered.
The great objection to the employment
of the Japanese is that they are willing
to work for almost any price that is of
fered them. This, to the white laborers.
Is decidedly objectionable, and as a result
It Is with difficulty that fruit growers can
find white help to work in the orchard or
field with a man that has no fixed esti
mate on his worth, but will labor as long
as he-is told and for what is handed out
to him.
Similar conditions exist with C. R. Han
Â«en & Co. They too are finding it not only
difficult but impossible to furnish help to
the many applications made on them
from all parts of the State.
One reason for this scarcity of able
bodied men is the exodus of so many to
the Alaska gold fields and other new sec
tions where mining has apparently offered
better inducements for acquiring wealth
than that of day labor on the farms or in
the orchards.

The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company made a formal offer last night
to the Supervisors' Committee on Public
utilities to sell its poles and wires used
in lighting the public streets for $50,000.
Another proposition was made to install
a system of incandescent burners without
a cent of cost to the city. The company
however, insisted on getting a contract
to light the city.
Edwin L. Jones, engineer of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company,
stated that almost every city of promi
nence in Europe had substituted incan
descent gas burners for electric lighting.
President Crockett declined to say at
what price the company would sell the
plant. He claimed that the city could not
enter into any contract unless It had been
advertised and let to the lowest bidder.
Attorney Preston informed the board that
the company was prepared to sell its
present pole line plant, comprising 2500
Poles, for lighting the streets for $50,000
The Mayor took the view that the pole
lino was not a utility in the strict sense
as it was merely Intended to lease them
to companies for the distribution of the
electric current. In any event the ques
tion would have to be submitted to a
vote of the people before it could be
adopted.
Crockett claimed that the lighting by
incandescent gas lights would save the
city the investment of $225,000 for S200 poles
and a distributing system offered by the
Independent Light and Power Company
Engineer; Jones then submitted the fol
lowing proposition for the directors of the
gas company:
"We will install a system of Incandes
cent gas burners for street lighting with
out any expense to the city, by which it
is assured that the amount of light fur
nished will bo from three to five times
more than at present, without increasing
the cost. The streets can be entirely
lighted by about 6000 burners, giving over
300 per cent more light than now enjoyed
at a cost much less than it can be lighted
by 200i) electric arc lamps and without any
investment of tho city's funds."
Chairman Reed read a letter from A. E.
Brooke Ridley, who represents makers of
electrical machinery and Kastern capital
ists. In regard to the city acquiring its
own electric plant. Ridley says that the
matter of Installing such plants for mu
nicipalities has been under consideration
by leading electrical financiers in Eastern
cities and in San Francisco. The letter
continues:
"It is entirely feasible that the city can
acquire its own plant, either in ten, fif
teen or twenty years, at a cost not ex
ceeding the present annual cost for light-
Ing the city's streets and public build
ings. If the payments are extended for
a period of twenty years the annual cost
of lighting during that period will be
considerably less than that now paid. It
will require about ten days to place, our
proposition before you in definite form
and I respectfully ask your committee to
delay action in the acquisition of such
plant so that we may have the oppor
tunity."

Plant for Public Lighting' for

The members of the visiting staff of the

Tax Collector Scott Seeks Payment of
Licenses â Bicycle Dealer Will
Test Charter Provision.
Tax Collector Scott yesterday instructed
his attorney, Frank P. Haynes, to prepare
the necessary legal documents for the suit
which the former has been directed to
bring against the Pacific Telephone Com
pany for unpaid licenses. The amount
involved Is about $200,000 and Includes the
license on 13,000 nickel telephones at J2
per quarter for a period of nearly two
years, amounting to $182,000. This money
is due under the provisions of an old or
dinance imposing a license on all electrical
machines. There Is also due about $9000
under the new order Imposing a license
of 50 cents per quarter on all telephones,
of which there are about 18,000 In use.
Attorney Haynes will draw up the pa
pers In a few days and the suit will be
instituted Immediately after.
Tax Collector Scott Is of the opinion
that the suit wlll,,not be finally adjudi
cated for several years, as he has received
Information that the telephone monopoly
will fight the attempt to collect from it
the moneys legally due the city as long
as It has a point to make, j .
Scott will have another suit on his
hands in the one to be brought against
him by Bicycle Dealer Allen, who refuses
to pay a license of $4 per quarter imposed
on those who rent bicycles. .He will test
the validity of the ordinance, making the
point that he rents machines for the pur
pose of selling them after trial. He claims
that sewing machine dealers are doing
the same thing, but do not pay license.
Allen says he will .also test the validity
of the charter provision exempting from
license dealers in merchandise having a
fixed place of business whereby $94,000 in
revenue has been lost to the city.

"The fundamental difficulty," Bald Mr.
Vining, "lies in providing men and not
In increasing the number of cars or the
building of mechanical appliances at the
foot of Market street. It would be neces
sary to put on treble the number of men
for two hours. The extra men could not
earn enough In that time to make a liv
ing, as at other hours they could not be
employed. Great care is now taken to ad-
Just the time table so that every man may
make a fair day's wages.
"The cause of overcrowding cars was
that two of the most important lines of
the company had been discontinued for
chango into electric roads. The Post
street line Js now in operation and is tak
ing away 12 000 people dally from the Mar
ket street line. The completion of the
Howard street line in a short time will
draw 20,000 passengers from Market
street. The discontinuance of racing will
also relieve the situation for a period of
six months.,"
Mr! VIning produced figures of the num
ber oT passengers carried by 1184 cars dur
ing a heavy day. Taking thirty-nine as
the number for each cor it was found that
on the outward bound cars 98.1 per cent
had seats; at Fourth street 97.4 per cent
had seats and at McAllister street, where
the congestion of travel was most appar
ent 93.1 per cent had seats. The inbound
cars showed that at McAllister street 4.4
per cent of the passengers were standing;
at Fourth street, 5.1 per cent, and at
Montgomery street 3.3 per cent. Going
out there were 17,107 passengers who
passed Montgomery street, 21.769 at
Fourth street and 27,036 at McAllister
street. Going downtown there were 25,107
passengers at McAllister and 22.101 at
Fourth street. The headway of the cars
averaged two to live minutes. One hun
dred and eighteen cars passed the ferry
on the turntable in one hour.
The Mayor asked Mr. VIning what hÂ»
thought of a commutation as a substitute
for the 2^4-cent fare, and he replied that
reduced tickets are taken advantage of by
the very people who do not need the re
duction. The laboring man could not af
ford to put up a large lump sum. He paid
a nickel thirty times a month and he did
not feel the expense.
Vining said he did not favor any under
ground or overhead system to relieve con
gestion of traffic. Tho underground sys
tem depreciated surrounding real estate
values with no corresponding Increase" in
the suburban districts. The double decks
were objectionable because it would ne
cessitate a large number of extra men
who would be employed only during the
rush hours. Even at present a conductor
has all he can do to perform his duties.
Mr. Vining said that when the popula
tion had largely Increased it could be han
dled with the side lines or by having four
lines of track on Market Btreet.
Secretary Clayton of the San Mateo line
stated that the objection to the double
deck cars was the difficulty in loading and
unloading. One stout woman would
blockade the traffic and cause delay. To
this the Mayor Interposed pleasantly by
saying:
"You might prevent stout women from
traveling and the difficulty would not
arise." /
"Well," replied Clayton, "if we could
have your Honor as a conductor it might
be done," which sally was greeted with a
general laugh.
VIning Informed the Mayor that If the
company were given a four-track line on
Market street it could not afford to carry
passengers for less than 5 cents. Last
year It coat 4.4 cents to carry each pas
senger. The company was trying to over
come the difficulties of congested traffic
and had already accomplished a great
deal in that direction. He was not pre
pared to inform the committee about the
gross receipts of the Market Street Com
pany.
A delegation from tho Point Lobos Im
provement Club entered an emphatic pro
test against the passage of the ordinance
on the ground that the transfer system
would be. abolished; the reduced fare
would cause the introduction of copper
pennies, and certainly result In a reduc
tion in wages to railroad employes. The
committee will continue the inquiry next
Thursday. . i

Although consumption' does not frighten commu
nities and produce panics like such infrequent .pesti
lences as cholera or jello.v fever, it is far more disas
trous to the Eastern States of the Union than the yel
low fever is to the South. Boston has been a yearly
sufferer from the disease, and Dr. Durgin of the
Board of Health of the city. is quoted as saying:
"Boston is one of the worst places on earth for con
sumption." The New York Post "in commenting
upon the disease in that city and State says: "In 1899
there were, in the boroughs of Manhattan and the
Bronx, 8016 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis', and
1559 from other tuberculous diseases. The average
The advocates of governmental action .for the eradi
cation of consumption are sanguine of good results.
The Board of Health in New York City a few years
ago issued a circular giving information concerning
the treatment of the disease, warning nurses ajid
others against carelessness in handling the sputa of
patients, and laying down rules for the disinfection of
clothing and premises after deaths. As a result of
these regulations it is stated- there has been an appar
ent reduction of about 30 per cent in the number of
deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis^ in that city since
For some years there has been an active compaign
of education in the Eastern States upon the subject
of consumption and the possibility of eradicating it
by the adoption of wise precautions based upon scien
tific principles. Massachusetts has taken the lead in
grappling with the disease, and in 1898 provided a
fund for the establishment of a State sanitarium for
persons afflicted with it. New York has now followed
the example, and during the past winter her Legis-,
lature appropriated money for a similar sanitarium.
Other States where the disease is common will un
doubtedly make like provisions if the experiments in
Massachusetts and New York prove successful, and
in the course of a comparatively few years this dreaded
scourge of that section of the Union may be-well nigh
suppressed.
jH\ ISPATCHES from Boston announce that hcre-
I ) after "everj' physician in that city must report
every case of consumption that comes to his
notice to the Board of Health, as he would any other
case of contagious disease. After a death from this
disease hereafter the premises will be entered by the
Board of Health officers and disinfection performed,
and other means will be taken to guard against the
spread of the malady in Boston. These new rule's
have just been issued by the Board of Health, and
the plan is to enter upon a vigorous campaign against
tuberculosis and stamp it out, if such a' thing is pos
sible." . .
WAR flGfllNST CONSUMPTION.-.
IT seems strange that San Francisco re
fuses to understand the conditions sur
sounding the hydraulic miners and the
residents of the valley whose property
has been destroyed or is threatened with
destruction by debris from the mines.
You congratulate your readers in your
issue of Tuesday on the promised ending
of the prolonged controversy between
these interests, and . cite the fact that
work has been -authorized to be com
menced on a dam on the Yuba, recom
mended by the California Debris Commts
slon for the purpose, as that commission
expressly said, of .impounding matter al
ready iii the streams, and you- conclude
your editorial as follows: - Â«
To the men who have achieved the good re
sults new in nikht much credit' Is due. The.
strife between the miners In the mountains
and the people oC the valleys was hurtful to
tl?e b*st Interests of California In many ways
and.lt wb9 a matter of general congratulation
when thry agreed: upon a programme which
promised to open a way, for hydraulic rninkig
while at the eÂ»me time securinc the farms
along the streams from harm. The outlook Is
now encouraging 'and it Is to be hoped there
will be no further hitch in the work.
. Now there has been no programme
agreed upon by which one monitor may
run one minute," and there will.be no such
programme.
Many years ago the detritus from the
hydraulic mlnea- began filling up the nv
ors and covering up; the lands, Including
many homes, and even the sacred spots
where rested the dead, and the valley
people were compelled to seek redress in
the courts. First came the Keyes cast,
which continued for several years, and
this was followed by the noted Gold Run
case tried at Sacramento by Judge Tern
'tile, and finally.' the celebrated case of
Woodruff against "the North Bloomfield,
in which Judge.. Sawyer- of J tho United
States Circuit Court laid down the law In
so masterful a manner as that no word
of it has since been controverted. Judge
Sawyer said 'that no man had a right to
Injure another. In person or property for
his own aggrandizement, and further, that
no pwer on earth could grant authority
to one person to injure another.
'After getting -such a decision and an
acknowledgment from all men that it was
the law; after erecting such an insur
mountable wall around their rights, it
would be idiotic on the part of the Anti-
Debris Association, representing, the val.
ley, to voluntarily -make a gap to allow
the entrance of any wooden horse, even
if recommended; by such oracles as the
great metropolitan press. All experiments
must.be made 'at the risk of the party
seeking the benefit. '
When Mr. Caminettl proposed his law
establishing . the Debris Commission it
was sought to get the- indorsement of the
Valley Association, but while that asso
ciation-did not: oppose It did not indorse
but was content to rest the matter where
Judge Sawyer put â¢ lt^-content with the
knowledge that Congress had no right to
delegate any. authority to any commis
sion to license the destruction of prop
erty. If the miner who was In search of
a dump wanteS to get the approval of
a Government -engineer for a contrivance
by which he could do It without injury
to any one. the "association had no fault
to find: but ltcould become no party in
any shape- of furm to' Its -construction;

at meetings of the association has been
to let it go on to the very verge of dam

Davy Crockett â "Be sure you are right,
then go ahead"â has been proven. by the
fact that in all the numerous suits It has
always been right. No objection has been
made to tTiP- expenditure of money by the

the miners along, but when plans are be

PARIS this year will be the Mecca for
expert marksmen of. all nations. Al-
I ready a score of noted .American
shots are . in the French capital
awaiting the opening of the competitions
in which they hope to prove their superi
ority over the marksmen of all other
countries.
The rifle and revolver cracks of the
United States are particularly sought for
the series of international tournaments to
be held in connection with the "World's
Kxposltion. and there is every reason to
believe that the Invitation to them Issued
by the president of the United Shooting
Clubs of France will be liberally respond
ed to.
Beginning in the. middle of June and ex
tending until the middle of August, the
tournaments will be carried on almost
continuously, and a fortune will be dis
tributed In, prizes.
Rewards are offered for best work with
rifles, shotguns, carbines, revolvers, pis
tols, military arms, bows, crossbows and
cannon.
The tournament will be under the
auspices of, the' French Government. It
has been organized by the Union des So
clctes de Tir de France.
Shooting in this tournament will be be
gun on July 19 and will be continued daily
until August 7.. The contests will be di
vided into twenty-four classes, for which
10.97S prizes, aggregating $4i),660, are of
fered.
Competition for these prizes will .take
place over the fine ranges at Versailles.
One hundred and thirty different styles
of targets will be shot at, and the -lls
tances will vary from thirteen to three
Independent of this there will be an
open international team revolver match,
beginning August 2. Teams will consist of
five men each and the distance will be flf
ty-flve yards. French marksmen are partic
ularly desirous of having Americans take
The Franco-American revolver match
by cable will be one of the most Interest
ing of the international events, and will
take place on or before June 20. It will be
shot by teams of ten men, each team com
peting In Its own country and cabling Its
scores to the opposing team.
Another live bird tournament will be
held under the direction of the Soclete le
Fusil de Chasse, from July. 13 to 17, Inclu

On June 19. under the direction of the
Bois de- Boulogne Club, the competition

the exposition programme is the fourth
international team rifle match and the
contest for the rifle championship of the
world.
The Merchants" Association has done and is doing
a grsat deal of work for the improvement of the city,
and that fact justifies the Mission Clubs in turning
to the association for co-operation in the effort to
f!>: The responsibility for the present condition of the
city government and to force reform. Phelan has
frequently boasted thnt he controls the administration,
that the heads of departments are responsible not to
the people, but to bin:. It is his policy that has left
the streets dark and unswept a field for the operation
of criminals, and upon him will rest thr blame.
To the Mission Federation Clubs credit is due for
the zeal ;vith which they are working for the general
good. Did an equal public spirit pervade all sections
of the <rity we should .ere long obtain reform. The
Phelan administration is trying to shirk responsibil
ity for existing evils, snd if the shirking be permitted
we shall have dirt, darkness and deficit, accompanied
by a waste of public funds for the support of tax
eaters, as long as Mayor Phelan remains in office.
On the other hand, should the vigorous and well
founded protests of the Mission Clubs be supported
by the community generally we may force the Mayor
to keep at least some of the many pledges he made
In a signed statement pubJished in The Call on
Wednesday G L. Center, chairman of the Mission
Federation Committee on the Board of Public
Works, analyzed the estimates for the board and
pointed out that "while there is no money to spend in
the performance of large public works a clerical bu
reau has been provided for by that board which is
out of all proportion and unnecessary." He then
segregated the items and showed that "clerical sala
ries incidental to the expenditure on public works of
$181,720 amount to $62,840." This, as he says, means
"that for every $3 spent in actually performing work
on the streets, etc., Â§1 will be spent by the Board of
Public Works for bookkeeping."
Mr. Lillie stated the situation too mildh\ Some
thing more than a deficit confronts the people. There
lire streets unsprinkled and dirty, neglecteil by the
city, which the merchants at their own expense have
had to sprinkle and sweep in the interests of their
trade and for the protection of their wares. There
:?. moreover, the midnight darkness of unlighted
streets which exposes the public to predatory foot
pads and assassins and compels the citizen to carry
arms for defense of his person and his property when
he goes out at night. Thus in place of the municipal
improvement*; that Phelan promised, the city suffers
under his administration from dirt, debt, darknes?,
danger and deficit.
"When our clubs were asked by this association to
support Phelan and the r.ew charter we were prom
ised, first and foremost, an economical government.
We have derived some benefit from the charter, such
2s the merit system in selecting municipal employes
and home rule, but we fail to find any economy in
ihc new administration. In fact, it is the most costly
that we have ever had. Under the old system we al
v. ays came out with a balance on the credit side of
our ledger, but now only a deficit stares us in the
face."
AT the meeting of the Merchants' Association
m Wednesday evening there appeared a depu
tation from the Mission Federation Clubs to
request the association to assist in an effort to force
the Phelan administration to keep its pledge of econ
omy. In presenting the- Tcqucst Mr. A. S. Lillie, who
headed the delegation, said:

and 500 rounds of ammunition for each
firearm upon presentation of invitation
card.
Hardly any enterprise on the part of the Govern
ment in the way of improving its service to the peo
ple has been more beneficial than this. Mr. Heath
states: "Already the correspondence which the de
partment receives in regard to rural free delivery
exceeds in bulk and diversity that of. any other branch
of the postoffice service." For the introduction and
extension of the system the country is largely in
debted to Congressman Loud of the Fifth District,
who as chairman of the Postoflice Committee of the
House has ably served r?ot only his State but the
whole Union.' Rural free delivery injures nobody's
trade, but benefits all. and there is no reason to
justify opposition to it from any source.
Commenting upon the benefits resulting from the
system, the Hon. Perry S. Heath, First Assistant
Postmaster General, recently stated in a magazine ar
ticle: "Rural free delivery will eventually impel the.
construction of macadamized agricultural roads all
over the United States. We are working in harmony
with good roads conventions everywhere to secure
proper roads for the rural carriers to travel over.
Great results have been already achieved in this re
spect, and more may be expected. On one route,
alone the farmers expended $3000 for the improve
ment of roads as a prerequisite to the establishment
of rural free delivery. * * * The direct advan
tages conferred on the immediate recipients of rural
free delivery are as obvious as the general benefits
received by the country at large. Farm lands en
hance in value by being made more accessible. Crops
bring better prices because the growers can get the
daily market reports and learn just what their produce
is worth. The wife can do her shopping at the
country store through the medium of the carrier with
out leaving her home."
Representative Cromer of Indiana said: "Before I
had the honor of representing the Eighth Indiana
District in Congress I went over three or four rural
free delivery routes in one of the counties now form
ing part of my Congressional district, "in company
with the special agent of the Postoffice Department
detailed for the investigation.' We found at one
point an organized opposition to the service on the
part of some of the country storekeepers, who feared
all sorts of injury to their business if the country peo
ple had their mails delivered-by rural free 'delivery in
stead of being compelled to come to the village to
receive them. We persuaded these people to give
the service a trial. Inside of six months they were
not only satisfied with the service but asked for
more."
SINCE some of the merchants doing business in
villages and small towns in districts where it
is proposed to extend the system of rural mail
delivery have expressed a fear that the operation of
the system would be injurious to their trade, it may
be worth while to point out to them that the ex
perience of other communities where rural delivery
has been in operation does not afford 'any reason for
their fears. ; : In the recent debates on the subject in
Congress that fea'ture of the issue was lully discussed'
and ample evidence was cited to show that the system
is a benefit not only to the people of the rural dis
tricts but to the country villages as well.

AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION
That was pessimistic prophecy, and not in broken
doses, either. Will the supporters of Colonel Bryan,
the Populist nominee, please to read it over and com
pare it with the existing industrial and commercial
conditions? The financial policy he opposed has not
only been in operation since 1897, but it has been con
creted in the law by enactment of the gold standard
bill. Interest on the public debt is reduced to 2 per
cent. Wages have not only increased, but more than
100 per cent more wage workers are employed. Busi
ness everywhere and of all kinds is so brisk that or
ders accumulate faster than they can be filled. The
bank deposits and depositors have increased, more
than 100 per cent. Where, then, are the "four years
more of harder times and greater agitation," so con
fidently foretold by this favorite of the Populists? We
fear that he was not born with a caul and that his gift
of prophecy. has not the trademark blown in the
glass.
We suppose that his admirers have his celebrated
book, "The First Battle." If they will turn to page
464 they will read his reprint therein of his speech
made at Baltimore in 1806. That speech pleased him
so that he thought it deserving of preservation in his
book along with other great, palpitating, pulsing
thoughts. In it he said: "If we win this fight now
reform will begin at once; if we are defeated in this
campaign there is nothing before the people but fovrf
years more of harder times and greater agitation, and
then victor}- will come. Our opponents say they want
to restore confidence, but the Republican party can
not restore prosperity in this country so long as that
prosperity is doled out to us by foreigners who" profit
in our distress. Business men complain that business
conditions are bad: 'I warn them that business condi
tions cannot be improved by following out the finan
cial policy which has brought business to its present
conditions."
Now Colonel Bryan is pleasing all such. All who
want the procession of the world's progress to stop
because they are too weak or too lazy to keep up
with it are pleased when Colonel Bryan lays all the
misfortunes of men to the "money power." In 1896
he had a fine field for this /sort of pessimism. The
Republican parly had been out of power for four
years and things were out of joint. The gospel of de
spair was more popular than the tidings of salvation.
Colonel Bryan went around rubbing the sore places
of business men without trade and workingmen with
out work. He laid ill their lacks and losses to the
gold standard and the gold bugs, and told t'-em that
things would go from the present bad to the. future
worse if McKinley were elected and the gold standard
were approved.
Perhaps this is because all of these cults have their
radix in pessimism. Whenever a man finds himself
without the energy and enterprise to keep up with
the procession, and lacking industry and thrift sees
others pass him in the march and succeed where he
has failed, he concludes that the world is wrong and
turns pessimist and vagarist.
THE POPULIST CANDIDATE.
THE country is getting a bit curious cto sec
whether the Democrats will nominate the Pop
ulist candidate for the Presidency and the Free
Silver Republican candidate for the Vice Presidency.
It is surely a queer situation for the Democracy to be
in", compelled to take its victuals already chewed from
the mouth of Populism. On the Western frontier
the law against selling whisky in bulk or by the glass
to Indians was habitually evaded by a white man first
taking the whisky into his own mouth and then
squirting it into the mouth of an Indian. Poor Lo
was glad to get the whisky even out of a white man's
mouth. The Democracy has descended to the same
condition. It is the "poor Lo" amongst parties, and
takes its principles and candidates out of the niouJi
of Populism without revolting. Colonel Bryan
seems to appeal to all the vagarists of the country.
This is probably because there is no social and po
litical vagary too rank for his indorsement. The an
archism of Altgeld. the communism of Pingrec an J
the socialism of the Mayor of Toledo all seek him out
ar.d are welcomed.
So far as the experiments have' gone in the direction
of adopting precautionary measures under the super
vision of Boards of Health the results have been en
couraging. We have already cited -the diminution of
the disease following the enforcement of Board of
Health regulations in New York, and in Boston
equally good effects are claimed. Thus it is stated the
deaths in that city from consumption have decreased
from 1349 in 1805 to 1236 in 1809. Considering that
comprehensive efforts to" suppress the disease have
hardly yet been made, and that what regulations are in
"force have been applied but a short time, it is certainly
encouraging to note so much of improvement as the
statistics show. It may be. indeed, that in another
generation consumption wiU be almost as ra.t as lep-
life of patients with recognized tuberculous disease in
this climate will probably not exceed three years.
Some authorities place it at t\y o years J among the
badly "housed, underfed poor of tfew York. As many
go away to, improve for die elsewhere, the New York
death rate indicates that we have between 20,000 and
25,000 well-defined cases of tuberculosis in Manhat
tan and the Bronx, and for these an average life not
exceeding two years is statistically allowed. For the.
State 45.000 to 50,000 cases would be a conservative
estimate.-"

ley.
"The Norwegian bark Kornmo also put
into Stanley while we- were there. The
captain died and his last wish was to
be buried ashore, so the bark put into
Stanley and the master was buried in con
secrated ground.
"During the storm our second mate,
Haider, was washed overboard, but he
managed to grab the mizzen lower top
sail sheet and we pulled him aboard
again. Chris Jacobson, an A. B. r was
washed off the poop and thrown against
the mizzen mast cutting his head badly.
These were about all the accidents to the
men."
Captain Graham's account of the acci
dents to his ship is very concise. He says:
"Had a succession of westerly gales,
lasting from September 2 to October 22, in
from latitude 64 degrees 38 minutes south
to longitude 64 d^grrees 52 minutes west
to latitude 51 degrees 27 minutes south to
longitude 57 degrees 56 minutes west. The
seas went clear over the ship, filling deck
to the rail. ' The cabin was flooded and
all the cabin stores were destroyed. Stove
in the skylight and broke the poop rail.
Damaged the steering gear and carried
away four bulwark stays. Blew away
fourteen sails and then put 'into Port
Stanley for repairs. Were in Port Stanley
from . October 23 to February 8. After
leaving Stanley we had a succession of
.westerly gales for eight days and then
had the usual- weather to port." \
There will be no desertions from the
Blackbraes while she is in port. The
boarding-house runners were out to her
in force, but they only wasted their time:
There is not a man on the ship who has
less than $150 cominjr to him, so they in
tend to stay by the vessel until she
reaches England again.
work we pot a weather cloth up in the
mizzen rigging. All our new suit of sails
was gone, so we' got out an old mizzen
lower topsail and set lt. For two days
the sail and the weather cloth held and
the ship was saved. Had they pone I
don't think any of us would have lived to
tell the tale.
"This was in the month of October and
when we gofinto Port Stanley we found
that the Blackbraes was not the only
vessel that was in distress. We found
twelve damaged ships there and learned
that eight more had put into Montevideo.
We were also told that the Italian ship
Bianca had been lost and her crew picked
up by the Beechbank. A Norwegian bark
was driven ashore on the West Falklands
and the crew escaped In the boats. The
hull and- general cargo were sold while
we were in Stanley for Â£11SS. The Dun
troon is supposed to have gone down with
all hands within a mile of us and a four
masted ship disappeared off Staten Island.
I think, however, that was some vessel
that turned tall and started for San Fran
cisco by the way of Good Hope.
"While we were lying In Stanley the
Norwegian bark Doris Broderaen came in
on fire. She was bound from Liverpool
for Guayaquil with a carRo of coal and
gunpowder and every minute wo thought
she would blow up. Had the ship caught
fire anywhere elpe but off the Horn the
crew would have taken to the boats in a
minute. It .resolved itself into a question
of beinp blown up or drowning, so they
took the chances of an explosion and
worked the bark Into Stanley. The poor
fellows were half dead with fright and
want of sleep, as not one of them dared
to lie down to sleep for fear he might not
live to see daylig-ht apain. Â»The fire was
put out and the Doris Brodersen had then
to be discharged and repaired. When we

of them have been taken up in making
two voyages to San Francisco. The last
time she was here it took her a year and
a day to come from England and this
time It has taken her 355, or eleven days
less than her previous voyage, to come
from England to this port. In both In
stances the long passages were caused by
damage received off the Horn In heavy
wesfther. On the first occasion her stand
ing rigging was very badly damaged and
she had to put back to Montevideo for
repairs. On the voyage Just completed
she had nearly a whole suit of sails
blown away and the steering gear was
damaged. She put Into Port Stanley In
distress, where she lay over three months
repairing damages.

XVI.â NOTES AND HINTS FOR
AMATEURS.
BY F. DUNDAS TODD.
I Notes and hints! Well, the average man
is in need of a. whole lot of them, but the
problem is, which particular one does he
1 need most at the present moment? The
field of photography is a big one. and some
particular phase of it may be brought un
der his notice to-day that may not inter
est him the least little bit,- and yet a
month later he might be .willing to give
considerable to have the information
placed In his hand. Again, I do not be
lieve much in giving hints. I much prefer
speaking plainly and telling how to do cer
tain things. On the other hand, a general
test like this permits a man, if he feela
like It, getting In a few body blows on
matters that do not justify a special ar
ticle.
For instance, I should like to get after
the average amateur photographer on his
craze for what he dignifies with the title
of "experimenting." He buys a camera to
make pictures, but before he has had it a
month one would think his sole aim in life
was to become an expert photographic
chemist. He exposes plates no longer to
have a record of something that inter
ested him. but that he may have a neces
sary adjunct in trying a new developer. '
He makes prints to experiment with a
new brand of paper or a new toning bath.
He thinks, he talks, he dreams about his
experiments, and honestly believes that
some day he is going to hit upon a com
bination that will automatically' produce
fine pictures. As a matter of fact, he Is
wandering in a perfect bog and is doomed
to stay there until he dies photographical
ly, or until somebody lifts -him out and
seats him on firm ground. Now. among
my readers there are certain to be thou
sand* of this type, and I want to Hind
out to them a few cold facts In order to
bring them to their photographic senses.
I think there Is more stupid nonsense
talked about developers than anything
else. Thousands upon thousands claim as
a result of experiments that they can
work wonders by modifying the develop
ing solution, and talk wisely about saving
this plate and that plate by their skill and
judgment. Rubbish! Their experiments
are not worth the price of the water used
in making them. In experimental work
the rule is one variation at a time, all
I other factors being "constant. So when a
man exposes a plate to-day on a snow scene
any two of them. There was always
something different that had to be figured
on and you all understand the pleasuro
there is in meeting a difhculty and by in
genuity surmounting it.
And that reminds me that I have a lit
tle trouble of my own on hand just now.
Five years ago 1 saw Niagara for the first
time, ami i>i course I photographed it.
Every negative went into the rubbish bin.
My rrientls thought they were line, but
they did not please me. Yon all Know
the average picture of Niagara; beautiful
effects j of water, but miserable rendering
or" foliage and rockâ black smudges, noth
ing more. The next summer 1 tried with
isochromatic plates snd a color screen. I
saw some Improvement, but still thÂ«^ sumo
miserable effects in leaves and stone. Tha
next time I went to Niagara I left my
camera at home. It was not because I
was indifferent, but simply because I hatl
not solved a probft-m tnat stared me la
the face and was in my mind almost every
day. I knew it was within the power of
isochromafic platc% to give me tne effect
I wanted, provided I got tho right kind
of color screen. Now. as I have hinted,
merely to go out and try color
screens on different landscapes is no way
to experiment, but it was necessary' ti>
fet a very definite dciensltic idea of what
wanted and just as exact a means of
proving when 1 had got the right answer.
It has taken me five years to collect thw
data I wanted, and I am now making tha
apparatus for my experiments. I expect
t<> have /the answer to my problem before
I make a single exposure on a natural
subject. 1 tell you all this just to illus
trate how completely every phase of tech
nical photography falls under the laws or
science. Experiment.-? made by individ
uals ignorant of even the elementary
principles of science are worthless.
But It is different in the realms of art.
The purpose of a picture is to give pW-as
ure. and if it does that for even fiw min
utes it has'fulrilled its mission, its maker
has made something worth making, even
although within a week he may have
learned a little more. And so on always,
happy over a picture to-day, seeing its
imperfections to-morrow, but with pleas
ure, for there is the satisfaction of some
thing attempted.- something done. alway3
a little more learned, always a little more
to be learned.
- All along I have tried to impress my
readers with the idea that a camera has
no brains, but brains have been expended
upon it. Often do T take up a new instru
ment find for half an hour admire th<Â»
brain power displayed in the mechanical
ingenuity it exhibits even In little details.
And then my equanimity is npset by get
ting half a dozen letters asking me which
is. the best camera. Any one of the in
struments en the market to-day selling
and develops with one chemical, and a
week later on a portrait, developing with
another chemical, he Introduces a large
number of variations â lighting, length of
exposure, temperature of solutions and
duration of development. How can any
sane man draw definite conclusions from
such a mixture as this? Of recent years a
few, a very few. "men have devoted much
time and thought to this problem, .and
their conclusions are now In the hands of
the public for consideration. As a matter
of fact, they find, given a certain exposure
on a plate, that it is really immaterial
what particular developer Is used, wheth
er pyro. mstfal. hydrokinone. ortol or any
thing else.~jT the negatives be all broucrht.
to the same density. So much. then, for
hoping to improve underexposures or over*
exposures by the use of a certain devel
oper.
They have also proved that once devel
opment has started it is utterly impos
sible to modify the final result -by tinker
ing with the developer. So all this talk
of saving an overexposed pjate by the
addition of this, that or the other "thing
is pr.re nonsense if development has start
ed before the condition of the exposure
is discovered. They do. however, say that
modification is possible to a very limited
extent if the error of exposure is known
hefor<: development has been begun. But
it requires a man to bÂ« a scientific expert
to know â¢exactly what to do to get Jhe
effect he desires in a rasp of ovtfxpo
sure; and. expert or not. he-cannot make
any improvement in a case of. underexpo
sure. With the average man -the only
modification possible is in the duration of
development, the principle belns that pro
longed immersion In the solution tends to
give contrasty negatives, while flat nega
tives are got by curtailing the time in the
bath. Ho was a shrewd observer who
many long years ago remarked that the
: character of a negative was determined
the moment the shutter v/as closed.- I
think I have said enough "to demonstrate,
that this fooling around with developers
is a very unprofitable occupation for any
thinking individual. The formula recom
mended by the plate maker Is quite good
enough for me. for T know he has In his
employ highly trained chemists and that
they have made hundreds of systematic
experiments before recommending the
particular combination that comes with
the plates. On tlio other hand, I would
be just as content to take any of the
ready-made solutions supplied In the.
stores if I were' certain they were com
pounded of pure chemicals.
The technical side of photography is be
coming every day more and more an ex
act science, and print after print is
brought under the domain of law. In my
early photographic days. I was assured I
had to "feel'*' the correct exposure and
that if I went a little wrong I could com
pensate in development. T never yet in
all my photographic life felt the correct
exposurt- or any other kind of exposure,
but . I soon found myself calculating it
from my past experience. Exposure is as
much a matter of natural lav as are the
combining . principles of chemicals, and
there. -is now no excuse > for haphazard
when making a picture. I need not - say
one word about rny own tables, which
are probably well known' to many of my
reader?. Â¦; .
I might talk about experiments In ton
ing baths and with brands of paper as
freely as I have talked about developing,
but I shall content myself with suggest
ing one particular Jlne. Itjis thisâ have
every hath- from the first washing water
to the last at exactly the same tempera
ture â say. â¬i> degrees. One -of the finest
printers I. know assures mo that this is
the sacret of her success. There Is n<*
guesswork at any stage, but absolutory
uniform condition?. -Every bath just 65
degrees, the same strength of toning so
lution every time, just the same number
of prints In each quantity of water and
kept there for just so many minutes by
the clock. And the Vame thing in the
hypo bath. ; The result? are prints* of a
beautifully even purple tone that I' have
â¢Hever seen surpassed.
' Tf you bought a camera, to make .pic
tures, please stay by your original Inten
tion. Anvbody can learn the ordinary
routine of photography in three month*,
but it takes a lifetime to learn. to make
pictures. Here, is a magnificent Held' for
experimentâ just think of It!â an occupa
tion for life, and a; pleasant one at that.
Every exposure.a problem. ' I have-made
many thousands in- ray life, but I never
found the conditions exactly the same in
at $13 would hsve been considered wonder
ful value for the money a dozen yeara ago
at almost ten times the price. And yet
people keep on thinking thry must Ret
liner tools in order to make liner pictures.
Fine tools are undoubtedly proon; I am
fond of them myself, but every outfit on
the market to-day is a fine tool, and any
one whq cannot make tine work with It
must blame himself and not th<Â» Instru
ment. I have in my day made a few, a
very few. Rood photographs, and nearly
all of them were made with a cheap,
nameless French lens. One of them 1
submit as the only illustration this week,
with the rernarK that I spent thre*
months thinking: about it In a general way
and three wfpks in a very special way
before T made the attempt.

Chicago Livestock Market.
NEW TORK, May 24. â The cotton market
was one great eennatlon to-day. No official
record of th# transactions was kept, but con
servative estimates placed the aggregate of the
day's dealings at considerably above the mil
lion bale mark. From the start to the finish
of this most extraordinary session there wan
onÂ© enormous outpour of . long, cotton, supple
mented by the most aggressive conduct on the
part of the bears, who added largely to their
short interest. While the primary cause- of
the decline might be traced to the brilliant
character of the crop advices from the cottoD
belt the- immediate reason for to-day'B col
lapse was the tremendous selling for the ac
count of a banking firm originally very suc
cessful ion the long side of the account and
for months quoted as the leading factor in the
ups and downs of the market. This concern.
Price. McCormlck & Co., failed to-day. The
announcement of their inability to respond to
calls for margins reached the exchange at 12-.3T
p. m. and immediately the market became a
vortex of excitement. This firm had for months
dictated the price of cotton the world over,
with attention directed chiefly to the summer
positions and more 'especially to May and Au
gust. To-day May contracts broke 78 pointsâ
they sold down to 8.4Sc. This was a decline of
120 points fr6m the high water mark. August
broke to 8.35c. a decline of 125 points from the
best prices current when the firm that failed
to-day appeared to be In absolute control of
the market. The decline on other positions
was generally 10 to 43 points. There were ru
mors pointing to other suspensions. The close
was at t-o lowest. \

NEW TOniC May 24.â Interest was still
further constricted In the stock market this
mornlr.g and the market had fallen near to the
point of stagnation when premonitory symp
toms b^cran to appear of distress on the part
of eome speculative Interests. The market sdM
off tharply on a larger volume of dealings
than for eome time past. This rat explained
eoon after noon by the announcement of the
euspenoion of Price. McCormlck & Co.. which
Â¦was msJc first on the Cotton Exchange and
â¢oon afterward from the rostrum of the Stock
Exchange. According to the rule cf the ex
change the suspension was followed by the
dosing out of outstanding contracts of the
eurpen<le<J firm on the floor of th* exchange.
The rest of the day wos practically devoted
to this telling and buying under the rule, other
operations being almost entirely given over.
The dealings for the firm's account footed up
to S3.9&0 chares before the close. A heavy out
standing short account wss In evidence in the
settlement and the movement of prices re
sulting was exceedingly confused and Irregular.
In many Mocks for which thero was little de
mand the forcr-d sale caused sharp declines,
and the active list was at one time from
1 to 2 points oft from the best. The steel
stocks were also much affectÂ«d. There were
decided recoveries from the lowest prices and
the closing, while almost rtagnant. showed the
net losses in the railroads generally reduced
to fraction*. The failure was primarily due
to commitments in cctton and the violent <ie
cfinee in that etajjle cf the last two days
*â¢Â»* the cause of the firm's difficulties. Sugar
continued the mo*t active etock in the market
and moved in a feverish and erratic manner
all dar- Its extreme net decline was 2\ points
and Jts loss en the day Is m points. The
movement of the stock was not accompanied
by any news and seemed purely speculative In
character. The Meel stock* were depressed by
the rather discouraging view expressed by the
Iron Age of prospects in the trade, that au
thority advising a rharp curtailment of pro
duction. Rates for money continue very easy.
In view cf the foreign exchange situation and
outward movement of gold much interest at
tached to the quest;â¢ wh-ther Liverpool will
buy cctton heavily after to-day's severe break
while the Liverpool exchange was closed for
a. holiday. A feature of the day was a sale
of Standard OH in the outside market at &C6.

the hlfiheet price on record.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
CHICAGO, May 21.â The rather bearish tone
of the Price Current weekly crop summary,
being taken in the wheat pit in lieu of other
neus, had a slightly bearish effect at the
opening, July beginning the session H'SVtC
under yesterday at 67c. Liverpool and Paris
were both celebrating and the absence of quo
tations from these centers of the grain trade
had a quieting effect on the grain trade here,
boon atter the ci>ening olfl items made their
usuai appearance and were absorbed to bome
I extent. It was Impressed upon the speculators
i that the Northwest needed rain badly. One
I expert said the country In places was dry as
a bone. Illinois, Kansas, Ohio and other Starts
continued to complain of fly, and one Kan
! fat man tent in a sample of badly yellow
; wheat to show what the rains had done in
', his State. Under these considerations July
] advanced to 67 l ,i'(i67%e. Protlt-taklng and the
j failure of a prominent' New York cotton firm
; eent July back to 67c. but the close was firm.
| July closed unchanged at 67'.tg67Uc
I Corn was fairly active and firm until the
! Prieo-MeConnick failure in New York un
: expectedly threw considerable, quantities upon
! the market. Then it broke and the close was
I weak. July left eft 'i@?ic down at 37%c.
Oats were dull and easy. Western offerings
were freer and the corn easiness was an in
fluence. July closfxi U'UHc up from yesterday
at 21%Q21%c.
Provisions were surpassingly dull the greater
rart of the session and to this condition of
affairs was due a slight recession in .prices.

to restrain them from proceeding to carry

Wong Wai, a Chinese merchant, was

calling upon the Board of Health, the
Federal Quarantine Officer and the Chief

that there Is not now and never has been
any plague In this city, that the prophy
lactic fluid is a poison and will give a per

of St. Luke's Hospital Association It was
decided to call for plans from Architect
W. H. Wilcox for the erection of an- ad
ditional wing to the present building,
which has become too cramped owing to
the Increase of patients. The proposed
new wing will be erected on the south side
of the lawn, facing Valencia street. It

basement will be a modern laundry and
large boiler, from which steam heat will
be transmitted to all parts of the old as

In the newrftvlng will be an up-to-date
operating room. The building will be of
two stories, with a deep basement, where
all of the machinery will be located, and
will cost in the neighborhood of $50,000.
This sum, and no* more, has been placed
at the disposal of the directors for the
purpose. Later on another wing will be
built on the north side, and gradually the
present building, which was constructed
over thirty years ago will give place to
a new hospital of the latest design.

HEAVY LOSSES IN

According to a statement made by Presi
dent Jordan of Stanford here a few days
ago, he was asked to select a suitable
principal for the Normal School during his
recent trip East. This he did in the per
son Â¦ of J. \V. Carr. Superintendent of
Schools of Anderson. Ind. On Tuesday
Dr. Jordan was here introducing Mr. Carr
around as his choice for normal principal.
Governor Gage, it is said, will attend the
July meeting of the normal trustees, and
there will be a number of changes In the
faculty. McNaughton has been little more
than a figurehead at the school, and Vice
Principal Dailey has been the real head
of the institution. It has been believed
all along that McNaughton would be al
lowed to go at the end of the year and
that Dailey would succeed him, most or
the trustees favoring this. Now that the
Governor intends to interfere this pro
gramme will be changed.
The local trustees deny knowledge of
Jordan having been delegated power
to select a principal, and It Is undoubt
edly Gage that Is bringing the change
about.
SAN JOSE, May 24. â Governor Gage will
take a hand in the management of the
San Jose State Normal School, and there
Is a report currtnt that Principal James
McNaughton will sever his connection
with the school at the July meeting of the
trustees. The interference of Gage is said
to be brought about by a number of re
cent incidents at the institutionâ charges
made a year ago against McNaughton by
the 'alumni, the threatened strike of stu
dents over a^peech by Professor Dalley
and the investigation of the charges
against Mrs. Place, head of the training
department.

Quinn.
The foregoing verdict was rendered by
a Coroner's jury up-night at the inquest
in the cases of Engineer Frank Shaw and
Fireman Henry Wetzel, who were killed
Tuesday at Alameda Point. The verdict
in Wctzcl's case was identical with that
of ShaV. The jurors refused to attach
blame to the Southern Pacific Company
or to any of Its employes because of
Switchman A. R. McCuen's testimony.
Admitting that he had thrown the switch
which caused the wreck, he firmly de
clared he had followed the line, of his
duty. He stoutly maintained that the
switch should have been closed by the
members of the yard crew who were be
hind him, as he was called ahead with
the yard engine upon which he was work,
ing to open another switch.
The funeral of Frank J. Shaw, the
Southern Pacific engineer who was killed
in Tuesday's wreck at Alameda Point
was held this afternoon from the family
residence, 809 Twenty-seventh street. Ser

direction of Iceland Stanford Division No.

Frank J. Shaw, a native of California,
aged about 40 years; that he came to his
death at Alameda Point. Alameda County,
California, at about 6:30 p. m., May 22,

him to fight off the reaper for months. :
Dr. O'Malley received his first Injury on
the island of Negros after he had been
nine months In the trenches. He was rid
ing to the front through a broken country
to attend a call for medical assistance
when an overhanging branch struck him
on the left side, throwing him from his
horse and leaving him stunned and ter
ribly bruised. That was In December,
when' he was attached to the Eighteenth
Infantry. A few weeks later, while on his
way from Hollo to Capig in a small boat
a storm came, on and in the pitching of
the vesael he was thrown to the deck and
again atruck on his left side, injuring him
self painfully. Although unfit for duty,
eurgeons were scarce, and he remained at
his post until February 16. when, while
removing a bullet from a wounaed man.
his left arm became paralyzed. Then he
applied to be Relieved, but the department
was so slow in acting on his request that
a month pawed before the relief came.
During that time he remained. in the field,
although It was necessary for his men to
lift him in and out of the saddle every
day. After live days in the lloilo hos
pital he was transferred to a transport
and came home. His death wag due to an
aneurism of the heart.
The dead soldier was the son of Austin
J. O'Malley. a highly respected citizen, re
siding at 1114 Hyde street, and his parents,
four brothers and three sisters survive;
him. Father O"Malley of Sonoma is a
brother. Dr. O'Malley was born in this
city in October. 1872. and was educated in
the public schools. He was graduated
from the State University and from the
medical department of the same Institu
tion in 1S95. Ho was for many years a
member of the National Guard. Soon after
taking his decree In medicine he went to
Alaska for the Alaska Packing Company,
and afterward practiced in this city. In
November. ISflS. he became a contract sur
geon and was sont to Honolulu, where he
remained until about a year ago, when he
was transferred to the Philippines and
saw active service with the Sixth. Kight
eenth and Twelfth Infantry regiments* on
Luzon Panay and Negros islands. His
earnest work among the sick and wounded
attracted the attention of his superior of
ficers, and probable promotion awaited
him. He -vas conscious just before his
death and stated to Father Ramm. who
attended him. that he had no regrets and
that had 1.1s life been spared he would
have certainly returned to the front be
cause of the great work to be done, there.
The body of the dead soldier was re
moved yes'terday to the home of his aged
parents and there viewed by many sor
rowing friends. The funeral will take
place on Saturday morning from at.
Mary's Cathedral.

WELL-KNOWN MARINER
IS CALLED BY DEATH
CAPTAIN ROBERT R. SEARLE,
. one of the oldest navigators in
Western waters since the Pacific
traffic became an object to the com
mercial world, died yesterday morning in
his rooms at the Palace Hotel. For many
years past he had been a sufferer from
rheumatism and kindred ills. ' Combined
with virulent attacks of this disease he
became afflicted a few years ago with a
.cancerous growth in the throat which
made such rapid headway that a trip
East was made necessary. Though sub
mitting to an operation there little Im
provement was effected by the treatment
to which Captain Searle was subjected.
He then returned to this coast and took
up his residence at the Palace.
For many years Captain Searle was at
the head of the Pacific Mail Steamship
fleet, retiring with a reputation for cour
age, brRvery and skill as a mariner. He
saved the money that he earoed in the
service and invested in real property. His
estate will reach the value of J100.000.
About $85,000 is In cash distributed among
the various savings banks of this city.
The property is situated in Monterey
County. As" far as is known Captain
Searles lert no relatives. The Public Ad
ministrator was granU-d letters of admin
istration yesterday and at onoe took pos
session of his effects. It is not definitely
known whether or not a will was left, but
the general belief is that Captain Searle
drew up a statement two years ago and
reposed it In the keeping of A. Halsey of
.Tuolumne County, a close friend of the
deceased. . The last hours of Captain
Searle'3 life were attended by the pres
ence of Miss 8. W, Nicoll. an old friend,
and Captain George S. McKlnnon.
One of the peculiar incidents in the life
of the deceased was his friendship and

TEMPERANCE CAUSE IS
GAINING IN STRENGTH
Mrs. St. John, National Evangelist,
Says It Has Made Great
Headway.
Mrs. Eugenia St. John of Kansas City,
national evangelist of the Women's Chris
tian Temperance Union, delivered an ad
dress last evening in the First Baptist
Church. She said that she had noticed
a great improvement in the State since
she was here as a delegate to a conven
tion three years ago. Particularly she
noticed that the wine grape vines had
been torn up and .there were orchards in
the place where vineyards used to grow.
She brought no discouraging news to the
coast concerning the progress of the tem
perance cause In the United States. Won
derful progress had been made by reason
of the Influence of the temperance work
ers in the education of the consciences
of the American people. Women formerly
had to get up great petitions before they
could get any legislation for temperance.
Now the men were introducing, temper
ance laws in legislative halls unsolicited
and the public sentiment was more
strongly in favor of It than ever before.
In Nebraska, for example, there were
forty-three towns in which no liquor was
sold this year. She believed that while it
was true that the newly acquired island
possessions had been made the dumping
ground for bad whisky that could not sold
In the United States, it would not be pos
sible that such practice would be allowed
to continue. A great future awaited the
people when intoxicating drinks were fin
ally abolished. .

work on. but the elx days he has put in
are irretrievably lost, and so his tale of
Â¦woe resounds throughout the courtroom.
"It looks bad." he says,â but what can
you do? An expert cannot testify to hand
writing without preparation, and I have
no time to make preparation. My work is
lost and I will pet nothing for it. '
As for ttie disappearance of Cathcart. it
looks as jf he sen. gone until next De
cember, for a k-ttpr written to Judge
Cook, but sent to the lawyers for the pros
ecution, says he will be away at least
Until that month. The totter is from M.
J. Brandenstein & Co., and they volunteer
the information that Cathcart has been
Â¦waiting for a month for the trial to come
on. that he has not be^n able to take up
the territory in the vicinity of Omaha to
which th^y have now assigned him and
that in consf-qur-noe they have lost much
business. They pay. too. in the letter that
Cathcart had a conversation with Judge
Cook in regard to his going. To this
Judge Cook answers that he does not re
mejnber having spoken to Cathcart; and if
h* did he .probably impressed upon his
mind what he impressed upon the minds
of the other witnessesâ that they must not
under any circumstances loave the city
until allowed to do fo by or<5or of court.
The f nerglps of the profecutlon were di
rected yesterday to the introduction of ex
emplars of McGIade's signature and hand
writing. Jn this they were successful only
to the extent ol a few signatures which
n<? signed to notes in the possession of
Bier and Regensbprgor. They were iden
tified by Charles Trull, n. bookkeeper for
the firm, who swore he saw McGlade take
his rcn and write each signature.
During the morning three lawyers con
ducted the prosecution. Deuprey started.
Wise followed hire in an hour or po .and
Byir.srton wound up the morning on J. J.
iJyom. who. as H5Â£istant to McGlade
when he was in the street department,
was suppopod to know a srood deal more
than h<? was willing to swear to. Lyons
could not swear to Mc-Glade's signature,
his "handwriting or anything that was his.
and he. further complicated matters by
Baying he frequently signed McGIade's sig
nature for him. There were several more
ex-employes of Ambrose who gave but
little testimony during the morning, and

A large and intensely enthusiastic gath
ering of British Californians met last
evening in Metropolitan Temple to cele
brate the t'ighty-Hrst birthday of Queen
Victoria. The annual dinner in honor of
the occasion was omitted and a second
grand concert in aid of the widows and
orphans of British soldiers killed in the
Transvaal was substituted in its place
The hall was profusely decorated with
the British colors, colonial coats of arms
and flowers. A large portrait of the
Queen "occupied the center of the stage
An American and a British Hag were
given to each membecof the audience.
The programme began with the singing
of 1 the "Star Spangled Banner" by Miss
Grace I. Davis and chorus, after which
the following telegrams were read from
the platform by the chairman, William
Greer Harrison:
OAKLAND. May 24.â The British and Ameri
can residents now crowding the MacdonouEh
Theater. Oakland, eend you their heartiest con
gratulations and greetings. God save the
Queen. PICKERSGILL,
. British Consul.
LONDON, May 24, 1900
I am commanded by the Queen to send her
Majesty's thanks to British residents of Ban.
Francisco for their congratulations.
SALISBURY.
"The Queen, God Bless Her." the toast
and subject of the chairman's address
was greeted with immense cheering. Mr
Harrison said: "There Is not a city lri
the United States, not a town or village
in Canada or Australia; where this toast
is not to-day drunk with honor. Around
African campfires, over the whole face of
the habitable globe this prayer Is heard
and this Is why: Victoria is the greatest
Queen yet known to hlstqry; a great wo
man as well as a Queen. (Cheers.) We
owe a deep debt to President McKinley
for refusing to interfere in the growing
unity between our nation and America.
There Is no alliance question, no need of
alliance between friends, but he who
tries to stir up strife between two great
nations is an enemy of the republic."
(Cheers.) Mr. Harrison closed with read
ing a stirring poem by Lucius Harwood
Foote.
Frederick d'Evelyn. late of Natal Field
force and Pretoria Siege Garrison, spoke
amusingly of "Kopjes and Things" and
was loudly cheered. The remainder of the
patriotic programme was greeted through
out Â¦with wildest enthusiasm.
WASHINGTON, May 24.â Secretary Day

Choate at London asking him to "convey

mlttee that passed the demands, were
called to identify their signatures on the
documents. Then ex-Auditor Broderick
was called to identify his signature: T. B.
Mclnr.es came i-a tell how he certified to
the demands in the office of the Super
visors, and Oscar Tplle. clerk of the
court, was haled to the stand with an affi
davit in support of a motion by the pris
oner for a continuance which bore his sig
nature, but the signature failed to get in
as an exemplar as Tolle had not, seen Mc-
Glade write It.
The case has gone over until next Mon
day.
Consigner Martinelli, Papal Delegate to America.
n ra ONSIGXOR SEBASTIAN MAR
//\fj\ TINELLI, titular. Archbishop of
11 Ik* v. Ephesus, the personal represen
ts l> tative of Pope Leo XIII to the
Roman Catholics in America, arrived in
San Francisco yesterday morning on the
Oregon overland. He was accompanied .by
Father Yorke and his own private secreta
ry. Immediately upon landing in this city
the party went dft-ectly to the home of
Vicar General Prendergast. and after cel
ebrating 9 o'clock mass In St. Mary's Ca
thedral the far-famed papal delegate de
nied himself for of the day to all
but a few of the local high churchmen.
His trip from Portland had fatigued him
somewhat and the day was given over to
rest.
Mgr. Martlnelll Is one of the most emi
nent priests in the Catholic church. Both
by virtue of his personality and his Intel
lectual power he has steadily and rapidly
mounted the hierarchical ladder until at
this present time he is reputed to be fore
most among the Pope's immediate subor
dinates. Although not a Cardinal he lacks
little of the usual power that surrounds
that lofty office.
In this country he has proved the wis
dom of the Pope's choice when the latter
selected him to succeed Satolli as papal
delegate at Washington. Engaging in
manner, with a thorough knowledge of
things American, which his ' ready wit
and adaptability of mind made possible
in a few years, he is the strong arm of
Roman Catholicism in the United States.
Combined with this Is a wonderful ex
ecutive ability in church affairs -and an
indefatigable spirit always exerted in be
half of his religion.
In the pulpit Mgr. Martinelll does not
run toward oratory. Fluent of speech
and easy of manner he is more of a
charming talker than an orator, though
he lacks nothing of the persuasive when
he sets his heart upon his speech. The
first opportunity San Franciscans have
had to hear this renowned prelate was
at mass at St. Mary's Cathedral yester
day morning when he pronounced the
benediction.
The only public appearance of the papal
delegate will be this evening at the lec
ture of Henry Austin Adams on "Leo
XIII," at Metropolitan Temple.
Refuse to Try the Charges
Against Adolph Sylva and
Ex- Judge Simpton.
Has Plenty of Other
T
Iiawyers.
Although the Pences Have Sailed for
Nome, Mrs. Craven Says She
Superior Judges Lawlor and Dunne have
taken Issue* with Judge Bahrs* action in
arbitrarily assigning for trial the cases
of perjury against Mrs. Craven-Fair and
G. W. Slmpton and that of subornation
of perjury against Adolph Sylva. Judges
Bahrs, Lawlor and Dunne met in consul
tation and parted. Judge Lawlor tool;
the Initiative after the consultation and
through the County Clerk returned the
papers in the Simpton case, which had
been sent to his department for trial, to
Presiding Judge Bahrs for reassignment.
Judge Dunne, an hour later, returned the
papers in the case of Adolph Sylva for
reassignment. Judge Bahrs received
them, sent the Slmpton case to Judge
Cook, who' will Also try Mrs. Craven-Fair,
but failed to place the Sylva case on any
of the calendars. This he will do to-day.
When the action taken by Judges Dunn;
and Lawlor became known throughout
the City Hall all other matters lost their
interest. Many rumors as to the cause
or the rupture between the three Judges
were given. An intimation was made
early in the week that Judge Bahrs had
assigned the three cases in view of the
experience of the three criminal Judges
and assigned Mrs. Craven-Fair's case to
Judge Cook as he believed it to be the
most complicated.
Judges Lawlor and Dunne refused to
divulge the reason that led to the return
or the cases to Judge Bahrs for reas
signment. District Attorney Byington
could throw no light on the controversy
save that he had requested that all three
cases be assigned to Judge Lawlor. This
request was not granted by Judge Bahrs
and the cases were distributed. It made
no difference to the District Attorney, he
says, to which court the cases were sent,
except that Assistant District Attbrney
â¢Deuprey was not to prosecute Mrs.
Craven-Fair, by reason of subsequent as
sociation with her, which would enforce
the transfer of another prosecuting at
torney to Cook's department.
Judge Bahrs said that he assigned th<=.
cases after due consideration and with
the belief that the trials would be expe
dited by reason of the arrangement ho
followed, as each would be long anu
tedious. He was not disturbed ' by the
fact that his action had broken a custom
of thirty years' standing and stated that
inasmuch as he was resppnsible, as pre
siding Judge, for all cases, he had In
structed the District Attorney to here
after send them to him in blank that he
might make assignments as he saw
proper.
Attorney Lafayette Pence, chief counsel
for Mrs. Nettie R. Craven-Fair, sailed
for Nome last night on the steamer C. D !
Lane, accompanied by his brother
Charles, who has. been associated with
him in the trial of the big case. Their
departure at a time when Mrs. Craven-
I" air was under Indictment on a felony
charge looked something like a desertion
of her by the men who have fought so
many weeks to establish her right to re
ceive from the estate of James G. Fair
an allowance as his widow.
"The Pences .have in no way deserted
me." said Mrs. Craven-Fair last night.
"They will be back~here before my. trial
comes off. and even if they were not here
I have other attorneys to represent me
many of them, in fact.
"W. W. Foote, one of my attorneys and
my chief witness, will be back from Paris
in time to appear at my trial. I shall not
want' for counsel."
Abe Ruef, who Is another of the wo
man s attorneys, said she would not want
for counsel.
"We'll get more if she hasn't enough
now," he said. "I don't think Mrs. Fall
will be well enough to appear for arraign.
ment to-morrow.
Mrs. Craven-Fair says she has been
kept in a dark room under the care of
two physicians since the day on which
the big trial closed. On that day a small
blood vessel burst in one of her eyes and
she has been suffering from the effects
of this ever since.

Democratic Convention.
The committee appointed last Tuesday
night by the Democratic local organiza
tion to, devise plans Â¦ for selecting dele
gates to the State Convention of the party
held a brief session yesterday afternoon
and .adjourned" until, noon -to-day. M C
Hassett is chairman of'the committee.- It
is | understood in Democratic circles that

Into a local convention 1 wlU be reported
The convention thus created; will appoint
one hundred * and i fifty-four delegates to
r epresn 1 1 the Democrats of San - Fra nclsco
in the State Convention called, to assemble
at Sacramento June 14. The County Com
mittee will meet to-night â¢ at B'nal B'rith
Hall.' -Â¦,: :
THERE has been no decrease in the
attendance at the sessions 'of the
Teachers' Institute. The second day
brought out even a larger number of
teachers and friends of the department
than were seen at the initial meeting.
The papers read were extremely Interest
ing and highly instructive. The musical
numbers that interspersed the weighty
discussion of complex problems were not
only a relief to the overburdened peda
gogues, but were greatly enjoyed by them.
Stanford University was well represent
ed on yesterday's programme. President
Jordan, Professor Charles R. Brown and
Professor Ellwood P. Cubberly gave those
present the benefit of their thoughts on
themes of great moment to the School
Department. Professor Jordan gave his
usual brilliant talk. Professor Brown
earned warm commendation, for his wise
thoughts and Professor Cubberly likewise.
The latter proved himself a deep student.
He was not possessed of a strong voice
and as a result many of his good points
were lost In the coughs and murmurlngs
in the hall. One schoolma'am in the rear
of the hall, unable to hear a word he
said, arose in desperation and politely
asked the speaker to talk louder. The
lady blushed and the professor did like
wise.
The programme opened with a song by
the pupils of the sixth grade of the Lin
coln Grammar School, under the direction
of Miss A. Furnsworth. The youngster*
sang so well that they had to respond to
a double encore. This was followed by an
address by Charles R. Brown, D. D.. lec
turer on ethics of the Leland Stanford Jr.
University, on "The Ethical Elements in
a Teacher's Influence." He advised the
teachers to inspire in their pupils a high
sense of morality. He pointed out that
going to school has several ends in view,
but the central one is learning how tt>
behave well. He said that the ordinary
instruction of writing and arithmetic
should be held in the grasp of a keen cen
tral purpose In the minds of the teacher
by appealing to the pupils to be better.
He created some merriment when he said
dramatically: "Any woman who teaches
simply because it is more remunerative
or easier than canvassing for a bookhouse
or because she has a grudge against so
ciety and can't get married had better
step down and out at the next pay day."
He thought that if there was less of club,
of society, of committee 'and organiza
, tion for upbuilding and correcting things
! and a great deal more of mother, the
world would be vastly better. The
teacher also; stated that the judgment of
the teacher should be of such strong, mo
ral character that it would be received
as a Supreme Court decision in the horn*.
Dr. Brown concluded his interesting talk
by saying that if teachers took up their
work in the right spirit and in the right
way they might be able to say at tha
close of the day's task. "We have been
teaching ethics all day."
When the applause which burst forth
at the conclusion of the lecture had sub
sided. Miss Estelle Carpenter, instructor
of music of the department, sang sweetly
about "Spring." She told of its birds and
flowers, verdure and leafy banks, and all
such things. The song was appreciated
thoroughly, and for an encore she sang
Liszt's melody, "/Thou Art Like Unto a
Lovely Flower." A five-minute recess
was then taken and upon reconvening
"The Essential and the Non-Essential in
Teaching" was discussed by Ellwood P.
Cubberly, associate professor of education
of Leland Stanford University. In part
he said:
"There is plentv of evidence that in our
teaching we place too much emphasis
upon the knowledge in books and not
enough upon the things that are written
about. The idea of brain development is
lost sight of in the endeavor to memorize
facts that are of minor importance* Our
subjects, too, are taught without proper
correlation. They need also vitalizing by
connecting them with actual life. It is
useless to study in a- geography about a
seaport If you do not know something
about the commerce of San Krancisco."
The Philomel quartet, which Is com
posed of Miss Millie Flynn, Mrs. Emilie
Parent. Mrs. Susie Hert-Mark and Miss
Cella Decker, sang some sweet melodies
which were greatly enjoyed. President
Jordan was next introduced. The well
known educator was given an enthusiastic
greeting. His subject was "The Growth
of the American. University." He said
that wisdom is knowing what to do next
skill Is knowing how to do It. and virtue
is doing It. He claimed that a university
is a place where men and women are
taught wisdom, skill and virtue. That, he
said, was the ideal of the American uni
versity. It is a place where men are
trained to know things, do things and do
them right. He. criticized the universities
of the mother country. He said that It
was the policy of England to make a gen
tle class. He referred to the University of
Berlin and said It was ait Institution in
the hands of a monarchy for the purpose
of turning out men of "blood and Iron"
He then discussed. the development of the
American universities. He described their
growth and gave reasons why they sur
passed the seats of learning of England
He also touched on the rapid growth of
the State universities. He spoke of med
dling politicians who at first stunted the
development of these grand Institutions
by using S their influence, to secure soft
