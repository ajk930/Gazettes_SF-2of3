Pictorial "Incidents \ of * a ; Stirring -Day in Chinatown.
Health Board we were, escorted beyond
the quarantine line. Judging from the
number of Chinamen Â¦who crowded the
sidewalks of their district It was evident
also that there was a holiday there, al
though for a very different purpose. Ser
geant Ma honey of the police force of
San Francisco, who has command of the
quarantine district, took- us duly in
charge, accompanied by other members of
the force. The Inhabitants of this now
famous district were evidently very
much exercised over the outcome of the
examination which was to be made. They
lined 'up on the sidewalks. In many cases
to the very curb, thickly packed. In evi
dent expectation of the coming health
officials. Large numbers followed be
hind us from npparent curiosity and in
terested motives.,
When we arrived at the morgue, which
was on the ground floor of a low, bovel-
Hke building, the crowd, for obvious rea
son3. was moro dense. No violence was
offered on the part of this closely packed
assemblage, . nor did . it seem - intends 1.
There was an ominous quiet along the
whole line, each Chinaman appearing to
have that stolid gaze so characteristic of
hi? race. There was a disposition as we
entered the building for many of the by
standers, to crowd uround us and obtain
an entrance If possible, but- it was-con
sidered prudent, where there was such
liability for the possible spread of infec
tion and . also for, other reasons for the
crowd to be kept at a safe distance. The
body .was- attired in all the gaudy ap
parel common on such occasions and was
covered -by a rude but peculiar pall.
The, autopsy, was performed by. Dr.
Kellogg.'Dr. Kinyoun and myself Â¦ assist
ing. ' I confess I was somewhat surprised
enue to many of the wealthy men of San
Francisco. > It is for them to answer the
question Â¦ regarding the feasibility of this
radical measure. So far all that seeras to
be necessary is to attend to these particu
lar buildings in' whlclv the dead - bodies
were found. This reduces the whole ques
tion down to a simple and practical issue.
-Yesterday afternoon Dr. Kellogg In
formed me that he had at the Instance of
Dr. -Wilson, the assistant city physician,
been summoned to see the body of a sus
picious -case which -had been under' the
care of Dr. Fitch,- who.was called to see
the patient on May. 24. There were - ap
parently no symptoms which pointed di
rectly to. the existence of the plague,
save softening and Infiltration of the In
guinal glands associated with a like con
dition of the. glands under the Jaw. On
the left- fide one. of these glands had
broken. down '.Into an abscess. In order
to clear up any reasonable doubt con
cerning the existence of the suspected
disease Â«Dr. Kellogg removed some portions
of. both, sets pf glands for. bacteriological
examination.- '-Finding microscopical evi
dences Mn them characteristic of the
plague he decided to make a more thor
ough examination of the body thia morn
ing in order, to obtain additional facts.
Dr.. Kinyoun, of the -:,Marlne Hospital ser
vice, Dr. â¢ Montgomery, formerly patholo
gist in, the-.Unlversity of California, and
myself .were . invited ,to take part In ..the
said autopsy.'. With such. an end in view
we repaired, to the morgue in the Chinese
quarter. It was-a strangely, significant
errand . in â¢ view of the surroundings in
the ; street : made apparent by the : Â¦ diffi
culty % of .wending through a' gay^crowd
viewing, the Decoration day â¢ parade."Pro
vided '.with Â¦Â¦ the : requisite Â¦ passes from the
statements to, the contrary, to be a bold
assertion. Physicians are no more afraid
of the plague than they arc of typhus,
which, by the way. Is the most dangerous
disease of all. â¢>. Personally I may be per
mitted in view of a 1 firm belief in this doc
trine to state thatMn my mind there was
no more fear' at the autopsy this morn
ing than In any other case of similarly, in
fectious disease. As a still greater em
phasis to this assertion it may be stated
that all the other gentlemen -taking part
in the autopsy had been injected with
Hafkine serum. The disease is not apt
to spread rapidly at first. We must re
mark also in this connection that it ha3 a
ppeclal predilection for 1 the Asiatic race
and exceptionally attacks the whites. The
great point, however, is to prevent its
gaining any possible foothold In San Fran
cisco 'and now seems to be the time to
make assurance of safety doubly sure.' If
prompt action Is taken the disease,wher
ever it may be or whenever it may come,
can be easily and absolutely compassed
within safe limits.
No better Illustration of this can be
offered than 'that afforded by the manner
In which fires are extinguished.. Take, for
Instance, the working of the Fire Depart
ment of New York, the greatest, most
alert and most efficient of Its kind the
world over. When the firemen are fight
ing a fire In bis neighborhood, the average
citizen gives hlmseif no further concern
as to the outcome.- nor has he any busi
ness 'Inside the limit of operations. Â¦ -. "Why
should not the , health : officials . stand in
similar relations. with; the public? This
applies not. only to San Francisco, but.to
every city; and, township the - world â¢ over.
The Quarantine line is drawn to keep the
busybody out. ' The merchants. Instead
of bulldozing the disease watchers, should
keep quiet and stimulate them to be even
more alert and fearless.. -In 'the end they
would always gain by speaking the truth
when such would do tho best service;
rather than being forced to do so when
It Is too late. Policy" Is 1 never an excuse
for implying a lie. Neither the health of
ficials nor the other, public officials; can
afford to deceive. the public on any issue,
particularly en a matter of public health,
which necessarily concerns the safety of
every Individual.- Ideal protection consists
in' knowing the'. danger at the start and
in working earnestly,' persistently and in
telligently in overcoming, it. : , To the latter
end the health boards arc always the es
sential ; means. . Therefore, : I ; say,, take
care of your health boards. "Don't invade

Dr. George F. Shrady, the Fa-;
mous Specialist, Outlines the
Ordinary Precautions Which
Insure Complete Protection.
THE healih authorities of this city
and the Federal quarantine officers
are still acting in conjunction with
Dr. George F. Shrady. the famous spe
cialist, who is here at the instance of the
New York Herald and The Call to de
termine the absolute facts in regard to
the sensational reports that bubonic
plague exists in this city. Late Tues
day night the dead body of a Chinese.
showing suspicious evidences of the
dread disease, was found in Chinatown
zvA- yesterday morning the authorities,
assisted by Dr. Shrady. performed an
autopsy. As a result of this investiga
tion Dr. Shrady says that the body re
vealed rranifest eviderices of the plague.
In making this announcement the
physician take? particular pains to
counsel the people of San Francisco not
to be alarmed. The plague is not only
not epidemic but there is nothing to in
dicate that another case will be found.
Ordinary precautions will insure the
people of the city against contagion.
The physician is particular to empha
size his opinion that there is absolutely
nothing to fear and that the people of
the city are justified in following the
usual routine of their lives.
. Nothing should be left undone, how
ever, he declares, to maintain a strict
quarantine of the Chinese quarter. It is
now a question rather of precaution
than of- prevention, as the presence of
an occasional case of the disease is not
by any means an indication that it has
gained a foothold in the city. The peo
ple of San Francisco have only to ob
serve the ordinary rules of sanitation,
to keep their habitations clean and be
assured that they are not in danger.
The health authorities have only to en
force a rigid quarantine and isolate the
district which shows signs of infection.
Dr. Shrady goes so far as to suggest
that if necessary infected buildings be
destroyed. If these measures of pre
caution be adopted there is not the
slightest need for uneasiness and in a
very short time the city can announce
to the world that it is free from even
a suspicion of the scourge. Evil enough
has already been done by exaggeration
and rumcr and the authorities of San
Frapcisco can now act calmly and judi
ciously with the situation that is not in
the slightest way dangerous.
The Call promised that it would pub
lish the frets in this affair and it is fortu
nate that the publication will give the
people of San Francisco no reason for
unrest or alarm. The outside world
rnay know now that San Francisco is
far from beinjj the plague-stricken city
which sensational newspapers have rep
resented it to be. The quarantine in
Chinatown is not yet by any mcins.as
effective- as it should be and the local
Board, oi Health should at once attempt
to carry cut the spirit and purpose of
its "own orders. The matter is one of
fcrious moment to the people of San
Francisco and if the officials have the
slightest thought of the solemn char
acter of their obligations they will sec
that the reliance placed in them is net
dishonored.
' Chinese go and come in the district
at wiil. They employ the cheapest and
most . palpable subterfuge to escape
from the district and to return to it* at
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR ALARM.
ALTHOUGH it can still be said that no living case of plague is to be found in China
town, a corpse has just been discovered in which the evidences of that disease are
manifest. It is with the greatest regret that this statement must be made, but the
plain truth must be told. This, as I understand it, is what the public has asked for. Now
the time comes to face the issue calmly, deliberately and judiciously. TJie few cases which
have already occurred as adding to the ordinary mortality statistics are of comparatively
trivial moment in themselves. We are simply called to count chances for the future.
This might be the last case and it might not. In either case there is no reason for
any unnecessary alarm. There is no danger from contact with cases when ordinary precau
tions are observed; thus the public can be assured that when a given infected house is prop
erly quarantined there is reasonable safety for all outsiders. It is wel! for these facts to be
known to the public as counteracting unnecessary alarm when a case occurs in a given, iso
lated and properly quarantined district.
The great point, however, is to prevent its gaining any possible foothold in San Fran
cisco? and now seems to be the time to make assurance .of safety doubly sure. If prompt
action is taken the disease, wherever it may be or whenever it may come, can be easily and
absolutely compressed within safe limits. The transmission of epidemics of this disease is
mostly due to soiled clothing and dirty and infected houses; thus the main remedies are
within easy reach.
What seems to be necessary for San Francisco to do at the present juncture is to
empower the health authorities to draw the fire lines, so to speak, around the infected build
ings. Empty every infected house of its inhabitants. Then, as to the house, let it be so thor
oughly disinfected that there shall be no chance of any infection remaining. If this be impos
sible, then resort to the radical measures of burning. I believe the safest thing to do with
any infected house is to take no chances short of the firebrand. I am told that Chinatown
yields a large revenue to many of the wealthy men of San Francisco. It is for them to an
swer the question regarding the feasibility of this radical measure.â Excerpt from third day's
report of Dr. George F. Shrady, the famous physician.
pleasure Â¦ It ' is : estimated that' "nearly
iooo coolies left Chinatown en Tuesday
night, escaping over roofs to houses
that are not within the quarantined dis
trict. . On Stockton street, on the west
side, are hives of Chinese which are not
in quarantine. The embargo on men
and material is simply farcical. The
street cars, crowded with passengers,
traverse the district and destroy utterly
any attempt at an effective quarantine.
The Health Board indicates that the
quarantine will be maintained probably
for six weeks. An emergency hospital
has been established in a tent in Ports
mouth Square. Postal clerks have been
stationed in the district, where they
must remain until the quarantine is
raised. The quest-on of providing food
for the Chinese is yet to be discussed
and the problem promises to be a ditTi
cult one for solution. The Chinese Six
Companies are also showing signs that
they will attempt to resist the quaran
tine, but as yet no legal action has been
taken.

The commencement address by Profes
sor William H. Hudson upon "The CuU
ture of To-day and the Literature of To
morrow"-was a classic dissertation upon
the effect of literature upon the intellect,
with, special emphasis upon the future
outcome of .literary culture.' .After th*
degrees had. been conferred President Jor
dan addressed the graduating class, tak
ing as his lesson the practical text, "What
Knowledge Js'of Most Worth." lie spoke
in part as follows:
The diploma which you have just receixwi
allows you the name of "Bachelor of Arts,
with all the rights, honors and privileges here
or elsewhere thereunto appertaining." This is
a very old form of words, going back to a time
when the scholar beloneed to the privileged
classes and constituted a caste by himself.
There are no rights, honors or privileges at
tached to your degree save those you ' carry
within yourselves. It does .not plactf you in
any separate class or give you any hold on
life which you did not have yesterday, which
you might not have without it.
â¢ It admits you to the roll of Stanford Alumni,
beloved of your cherishing mother, and it
bespeaks for you the attention of the com
munity as a youth of promise, who has had
fair opportunities for training, has used them
faithfully, and from whom growth and achieve
ment may be exsected.
And now as we stand at the end of the cen
tury to which your teachers belone and at
the beginning of the century which is yours, it
may be worth while to ciance back over the
history indicated by these words of your di
ploma. "With all the rights, honors and privi
leges here or elsewhere thereuntoappertaining."
The work which you have done is very dif
ferent from that of the youth of promise a
century ago, who cherished their diplomas for
the sake- of those very rights, honors and
privileges which you will never find.
It is clear that the knowledge Is of most
worth which can be most directly wrought into
the fabric of our live?, i That discipline is most
valuable which will best serve us In "quietly
unfolding our own Individualities."
- Thus far no standard had been acreed upon
In these regards, nor did those who had tbe
affairs of higher education in charge recognize
even the possible existence of such a standard.
The rewards of knowinr and doing are of
fered to all alike. They are the power to know
and do. the- only legitimate prizes of the real
university. To place all men and all studies
on one footing is to make a real republic of
learning. This once done, the question of
"What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?" is one
for each man to answer for himself. What
knowledge is worth moM to me? And the very
attempt to answer this question is in Itself
one of the most important factors in higher
education. That each should answer It for
himself Is the essential element in the freedom
of the university, and each year as it passes
sees the American university more democratic

that of loyalty to the Government and love f<>r

Although the authorities here tft reti

Event* elsewhere !n the field rof war
All other news important enough in a way sinks into significance beside the occupation
of the Boer capital. One cannot help being struck by the capacity of Lord Roberts for directing
his movements in such a way as tocause a remarkable coincidence in dates. The day chosen
for his entry into Johannesburg was the first anniversary of the arrival of Sir Alfred FMner and
President Kruger in Bloemfontein for the important conference concerning the points at issue be
tween Great Britain and the South African republic, especially those connected with the grievances
of the outlander population of the city of gold.
defenders of the forts Were ordered by the local committed appointed to preserve the peace to
leaveiheir posts. Measures were taken to control the rank and file of the British prisoners by
sending to them some of tfieir own officers. Citizens assembled in Church Square, in the center
of the town, to receive Kie victors when they entered.
TF UNOON, May 31.â -The Boer war is over. Before this news reaches you the British flag will
Jj be flying over Anything that may happen now is merely a matter of policing and
-â pacification. The War Office received no information yesterday as to the movements of Lord
Roberts' troops, and at 25 minutes after 1 o'clock this morning it was stated that the au
thorities had no nev^s for publication. The Daily Mail, therefore, obtained the first inkling of the
great news through its correspondent, Ear! of Rosslyn, who has been a prisoner at Pretoria. He sent
word under date of yesterday that Pretoria would be in the hands of the British in two hours.
President Kruger has left the Transvaal capital as a fugitive, having probably been de
posed. He was reported yesterday to be at Watervalboven, which is not marked on any availa
ble map. This can hardly be Waterfall, where the British Â«o'^rs were confined, but is appar

movement Is not confined to the "Boxera."
Eight rioters who were captured will be
decapitated. Riding through the s<iuth

Some Heavy Fighting.
LONDON. May 31.â The Daily Mail has
received- the following . from Tientsin,
dated May 30: "Heavy lighting has taken
place between the imperial troops and the
Boxers at Lai-Shin-Hi-Slen. but the re
sult is not known here. Railway traffic at
Peking has been resumed. The foreign
settlement here is sufficiently protected by
the American and Japanese troops, which
have been landed. Consequently, the ex
citement has abated."
A special dispatch from Shanghai, dated
to-day, says: "Yesterday the Chinese
Government issued an edict prohibiting
the Boxer organizations, under penalty
of death. The edict, which was signed by
the Emperor, was concluded in equivocal
terms and was promulgated more as an
excuse than in condemnation of the.
movement. 3
More of an Excuse.
WASHINGTON, May 30.â The supposi
tion here is that the edict referred to was
Issued as a result of the pressure of the
foreign legations at Peking. The dis
patches from China heretofore have
stated that the diplomatic corps had de
cided to ask the Chinese Foreign Office to
define explicitly the measures the Govern
ment Intended to take in dealing with the
Boxers, and yesterday's edict prohibiting
the organization under penalty of death
i3, in all probability, the response to the
representations made. That the document
is couched In equivocal terms is not sur
prising to officials here who are acquaint
ed with conditions in China. The Empress
beloncs to what is known as the \"re-
sympathy to bear up bravely under the
trying ordeal that Alatthai must now
surely pass through. What line of de
fense he will make has not been- decided
upon as yet.
"BOXER" ATROCITIES CONTINUED
AND FOREIGN TROOPS LANDED
actlonary party" In Chinese politics, and
the Emperor being under her influence.
It is not surprising that the edict is more
of an excuse for the movement than a
condemnation of it. .
Germans Not Attacked.
BERLIN, May 30.â Regarding the disor
ders fomented by the Boxers, a high offi
cial of the German Foreign Office said to
day:
â¢^.German citizens have not yet been at
tacked. Germany, therefore, has been
following the lead of France In diplomatic
action, her citizens being more immedi
ately affected. The case will be otherwise
ir the German legation at Peking is at
tacked.'.'.
When asked if It were true that 100
German marines had joined 100 French
marines for the rescue of the imperial
Belerians. the official replied:
"There have been no calls for marines.
It must have been the civilian Germans
acting upon their own responsibility. The
Foreign Office attributes the trouble In
China to the hostile^attltudc of the pres
ent Chinese government toward foreign
ers."
! f-r->IENTSIN, May 30.â American, Brlt-
I lsh. Japanese, German, Italian, Rus-
I Blan and French troops to the num-
I ber cf 100 each have been ordered to
â¢*- g^iard their respective legations at
Peking, but the Viceroy here will not al
low them to proceed hence to Peking on
the railway without the authority of the
Tsung-11-Yaroen. One hundred and eight
Americans, with a machine-gun and a
field gun, landed here last night, amidst
great enthusiasm on the part of the resid
ents. Five Russian and one British war
ship have arrived at Taku and the British
are now landing. Other warships are
hourly expected.
Russian Troops Can't Pass.
TIENTSIN. Thursday. May 31.â The
Chinese refuse to allow Russian troops to
pass the Taku forts.
The rescue party of Frenchmen and
Germans returned from Changhsintlen
yesterday afternoon. They confirm the
report that the besieged Belgians are now
sate at Peking. They found several thou
sand B*xers about the ruins of LÂ»u-KoChiao
and Changhsintlen stations. The bridges
have been tiaraased and the rolling stock
destroyed. At boih places the damage
done fs considerably treater than at
Fangtl. The members of the rescue party
saw several bodies of Chinese tearing up
the sleepers, and In one case a mandarin
was looking on. They further assert that
the missionaries and others escaped 'from
Paotlng in boats.
The imperial Hallway Directory is en
deavoring to fasten the blame for the
damage at Fang-Tai on the foreign em
ployes, principally the British, whom, they
say. should not have left their posts. The
foreigners, however, did not leave until
thev saw Lu-Ko Chlao Station, five miles
away in flames, and an attack had actu
ally been made on an engine, from Fang-
Tal which was running on the Lu-Han
line" In an attempt to rescue the Belgians.
The foreign men-of-war have arrived
to-day. Five Russian warships and
two Russian gunboats, one French war
ship two British warships and one Italian
warship are all landing men.
Fresh Atrocities Committed.
SHANGHAI. May 30.â The British war
shirs Orlando and Algerine are landing

There Is comfort in the knowledgs so

Root, the great kidney remedy fulfills every
wish in curing rheumatism, pain in tha
back, k!dneys, liver, bladder and every part
of the urinary passage. It corrects inability
to hold water and scalding pain in passing
it, or bad effects following use of liquor,
win; or beer, and overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go cften
during the day. and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the extra-

Filo Gordenez and Joe Bonercuello got
into an altercation last night with Theo
dore 1 Mender.; alias "the. shadow," at 19
Hlnckley place, and 1 bothiwere cut about
the face and neck with a dagger by Men
dez. They were troated at the Harbor
Hospital. Mendez escaped.
The exercises were held under the aus
pices of the Association of Veteran Fire
men and the Exempt Firemen. Chief Sul
livan took charge and introduced the
speakers. Captains Sam McDowell, vice
president -of the association, spoke first,
taking the organizations of firemen for his
subject. \ He told of the work they were
doing, of the bonds between the men
they tightened and of the memories they
keep alive. There was a brotherhood,
natural and not to be suppressed, among
all firemen, and in standing so well to
gether and for each other they showed a
characteristic common to the brave.
Captain McDowell was followed by Rob
ert Ferral, who spoke of the day Itself
and of the wealth of meaning It brought
to all who gave a thought to its origin
or purpose. â¢
Starting at first, he said, as a day when
the loyal living could honor Â¦ the loyal
dead. Memorial day had become one on
which all who have laid a loved one away
could join in the great bond which sorrow
weaves. It has made friends of foes for
in, the 'leveling . realm â¢ of death all are
equal and all share in the tribute of the
day. It Is characteristic of this republic
he continued; that it should be the only
firemen paid their tribute to the
dead in their plat In Laurel Hill
II Cemetery. There was no band, but
the west wind brought faint music
from those playing in the National Ceme
tery. There was no military display, but
the midday salute and the minute guns
at the Presidio threw their martial fervor
over the hills to the firemen's plat, the
sound falling softly from the distance.
But there were flowers and sorrow, and
gray heads to bow In sympathy with the
words of the speakers.
There are many graves In the firemen's
plat, for It has been gathering the dead
since 1S54. There are many long for
gotten by the world who have been sleep
ing for almost half a century; but they
were not forgotten yesterday, and when
the simple exercises were over Mowers
showed at the foqt of every, headstone.
In the center of the plat rises the monu
ment erected to the memory of Chief
Scannell by the men who served under
him, and high up on the shaft was hung
a wreath of white and red and green. It
was at the foot of this monument that the
exercises were held. The speakers deliv
ered their addresses f rom the lawn over
the old chief's final resting place, and the
people gathered around on the walks and
on the grass. There was no pomp or

FIREMEN JOIN .
IN TRIBUTE TO /
THEIR DEPARTED
In the evening additional exercises were
held at Metropolitan Temple. The hall
was crowded with a patriotic audience
which showed enthusiasm every time the
name of, some great American was men
tioned or a worthy deed was extolled by
a speaker. An excellent band discoursed
national airs and the music aroused the
audience to a high pitch of patriotism.
Rev. A. Drahms delivered the invocation
at the outset of the exercises, after which
the chairman of the evening,' General Kd
ward S, Salomon, past department com
mander of the Grand Army of the Re
public, made some introductory remarks.
He appealed to the people to Join the or
gnnizatlon In a proper observation of the
day. He read the original order made by
General John A. Logan, as commander of
the G. A. R., which brought about the
beautiful custom of decking the graves of
departed soldiers with spring flowers. He
stated that a German soldier was the or
iginator of the idea. In a letter to-Gen
eral Chlpman, the soldier called attention
to the beautiful custom which existed in
his country of decorating the resting place
of men who died in defense of their coun
try, and suggested that the men who laid
down their lives in defense of the stars
and stripes should not be forgotten in
death. Ooneral Chipman forwarded the
letter to General Logan, and the latter
was so Impressed with the Idea that he
forthwith issued the order which has re
sulted In the observance of the beautiful
custom. . __ T
The chairman introduced Hon. James
D. Phelan to the audience. The Mayor
delivered a pleasing, address, which was
filled with patriotic fire and which was
highly appreciated by the audience. He
was Interrupted throughout by loud ap
plause. The :, Plymouth quartet followed
with an appropriate song.: The oration
was delivered by Hon. Frank McGownn.
It was carefully prepared. Instructive
and breathed patriotism in every line.
Mrs. T. C- Mastellar sang a song; Mrs.
Nellie : Holbrook BHnn recited : . M. J. Orr
played a cornet solo: F, Cook Cnldwell
also delivered a recitation; the Plymouth

"America," and the entertainment con
cluded with "taps," which was blown by
M. J. Orr.

The Plymouth Quartet rendered another
selection and then a firing squad from Lin

graves of the departed heroes. As the
echo of the last volley died away in the
distance a United States army bugler
played "Taps," the soldiers' good night,
and the exercises were concluded.

When sunset robs the day of lipht.
And all their shapes full slowly change and

Rut leave the outline still in light.
Hut. though those scenes have lost their rugged

And dancers past have lost their dread,
Tl.e UPK of time can never cloud the view.
That brings to mind our honored dead.
They strove beside us in those trying years.
They marched in danger by our side.
They shared our soldier hopes and fears.
Our" boon ccmjonlons true and tried.
They form a halo rcund thnÂ«e fading scenes.
That grows in brightness year by yar.
As one by one the Reaper with his sickle,

A comrade from our straggling rear.

Judge Dibble's Oration.
Mr. President. Comrades and Citizens:
Nearly a generation of human life has
pa-sÂ»d since Memorial day was established
by the Grand Army of the Republic. This
is* the thirty-second anniversary, the thirty
third celebration of what has come to be
a national festival of loyalty. The direction
of the celebration Is still In the hands of
our great civlc-mllltsry order, and the place
of honor in the military pageant Is still uni
versally accorded to the veterans of the
army of the t'nlon; yet Memorial day will
purvlve and will be observed by the patri
otic citizens and loyal solfllers of the re
public long. Ions after the last comrade of
the. Grand Army has been mustered out.
In this bivouac cf the ]o.yal dead where
we Ftai.d to-day, as In other national ceme
teries throughout the land, there now He
tide by side with those who wore the blue
In that rldor war for the Union and for lib
erty the dead soldiers of a new generation
who in these inter years bore, arms to up
hold the majerty of the republic and the
honor of the flag. Among the loyal dead of
thin younger generation there lie many whose
fathers wore the gray durinc the war be
tween the North and the South. In our
symlKillc memorial ceremonies we of the
Grand Army place garlands upon their
graves as well as uj>on those of our own
comrade*. So, through th* year* and gen
erations to come. Memorial day will ever
bf "observed in commemoration of that pas
sionate eentlment of dr-votlon to the flag
which Inspired the heroic volunteers j of
Shcrldan'e division who at Chattanooga,
under the eyes of Grant and Thomas, and
yet without orders, carried Old Glory up

of the younrer generation of soldiers, heroes
of the Spanish war, who wrre with Shatter

San Juan and El Caney.
Changes in the Country.
What marvelous changes have taken place
in our beloved country during the five and
thirty years that have passed since the
diebandment of the two mltrhty volunteer
armleE which met In deadly conflict In the.
<"ivli War. The sons of the South folded
their banner, which had gone down In de
feat, but without dishonor, and addressed
thempelves with such lights as they had to
the rehabilitation of their desolated States.
Negro ulavery. which precipitated the war,
had been swept away. The theory of State
rights, of Htate sovereigntyâ the antithesis
of the national Ideaâ had been submitted to
the arbltrlment of war and had been re
jected. It would have been beyond human
nature if there had not been heartburning*
and poignant regrets over lost hopes and
lost ambitions. But when a noted Senator
ln| Congress said the other day that not 5
pÂ»>r cent of the people of the Bouth regretted
the war for the destruction of the Union and
implied that the South would even now re
store the old order he misrepresented the
lieople /or whom he claims to si-eak. There
are race problems and consequent political

The object of the Grand Army In Its rela

to organize the victory which had been won
on the field of battle. The post rooms be

Object of the Grand Army.
The Grand Army as a civic body, retaining
the forms only of a military organization,
1? without a parallel among the great asso
ciations of the world. Other bodies, whether
constituted for educational, for rflitrlous,
for charttnble or for fraternal purposes,
have corporate perpetuity nnd succession.
The Grand Army haÂ» a self-limited life.
Onjy those, have been permitted to become
members who served In the Union army or
navy. With them the order die*. Vet, what
a glorious, what an immortal history.
The upsprlnging of the nation !Â« the piv
otal historic fact of the heroic period with
which the members of the Grand Army have
been identified. The struggle over slavery
wan incidental, though historically inevit
able, perhaps, whra considered with regard
to the contending types of civilization. But
the fundamental issue which was submitted
to the gauge of battlp was the issue be
tween the national Idea and the doctrine of
local supremacy and soverelEnty. The na
tional idea prevailed. The nation was fruc
tified by the blood of the roartyred Lincoln.
The mighty volunteer army which ht-: had
called Into existence, though flushed with
victory and led by the greatest general of
modern tim^s. waÂ« dissolved In a day. as It
were, to reappear In the clvlc-nillltary body
known as the Grand Army of the Re
public.
The manner in which Memorial day was
celebrated a year ngo and again to-day, here
and throughout the land, shows that the
veterans of the wcr for the Union still hold
the affections of the people, and that the
Grand Army of the Republic is still a llv
ine force in the land.
When the late Sjianish war came so unex
pectedly and the' military spirit of the new
generation was suddenly arv.used it was
thought and said that the veterans of the
war for the Union would be relegated to the
rear and soon fonrotten; that new ideas,
new Eentlment would pres=s to the fore; that
new heroes would find public favor. This
did occur to some t-xtent. but not as pre
dicted and' not as might have been ex
pected. The fact that the representative
veterans of the Civi! war were not forgot
ten', but bore a conspicuous part in the
new conflict, although a full generation had
passed since the rebellion, was owing to the
maintenance and persistent influence of the
Grand Army. It will not be overlooked that
the chief magistrate of the nation, the com
manding general of the army, the S<H-retary
of War. the naval commander of the Asiatic
Fquadron who was to win world-wide re
nown and the major general selected to com
mand the army of invasion in Cuba and
whose fortune it was to win a signal victory
there, were all comrades of the order. Not
only this, but divisions, brigades and regi
ments were commanded by men who served
with Grant and Sherman and Sheridan.

tional eramleur, for national glory.
It is a rP-rt of the history of our country
of this iTiod that the Grand Army has
l>pen eloaely Identified with the marvelous
growth and advancement of the republic.
Every chief magistrate since the organization
of the Grand Army four and thirty years
ajjo. except one, has been a member of the
order. Kvery commantler of the army,
every ranking admiral of the navy and
many of the leadlnR statesmen of the land
have been comrades In pood standing. But
more than this, the Grand Army has been
the radiating center at all times of the most
ardent sentiment of loyalty to the flag. It
has been the Influence of the Grand Army
beyond all else that has led to the persist
ent and universal inculcation of pontlments
of patriotism and loyalty In the public
schools.

members of the organization lie buned

The scene in the cathedral was highly Im
pressive. Xeajrly a thousand young sol
diers knelt in prayer and above the mur
murings that filled the sacred edifice
could be heard the clanking of aabers. It
was the first time In the history of tha
regiment that Memorial day was observed
with such solemnity by its members. .. In
the past the organization had joined with
other civic and military bodies in the ob
servance of the day, but . the faxt that
several of the members of the league hail
died In the Philippines while de.f ending
their country's ting caused the officers to
decide on a separate celebration. : .
In obedience to orders the cadets assem-.
bled on Van Ness avenue and when all
the companies were marshaled, the. com-
mand moved toward the cathedral.. The
main floor of the church was reserved for
them. The galleries were filled 10 over
sowing and downstairs every available'
inch of standing room was utilized by de-
vout Catholics. ~ Â¦ ..;
The requiem mas3 was solemn and Im
pressive. Rev. Father O'Malley. a broth

name who died at the Presiaio. was cele-:'
brant of the mass. Rev. Charles Kamm
was deacon and Kev. Donald McKinnon
subdeacon. Kev. Father O'Ryan. spirit

master of ceremonies and also preached
the sermon. Special mu>jc was rendered'
by a choir composed entirely of carteta.
under the direction of Robert J. Harrison,
the organist. Their viAces sounded
sweetly In the difficult sacrtSd pieces thej
rendered.

TOO SPEEDY FOR
THE OAKLANDERS
HARNESS HORSES
HOLD LEVEE AT
OAKLAND TRACK
Golden Gate Driving Associa
tion Dayâ Alto Vela Wins .
f v_the Cup.
THE complimentary racing matinee
given by the Golden Gate Park
Driving Association yesterday . at
Oakland track was attended by over
3000 people, who witnessed some excellent
sport, heard a grumble or two, and re
turned home well satisfied with the after
noon's outing. The weather was perfect
and the track never in better condition
for horses of the light harness brigade.
Edward D. Jacks, George L. Sweet and
"Jim" Chesley held sway in the Judges'
stand, while T. J. Crowley ably tilled the
position of starting 3udge. The well
known firm of Crowley & Co. attended' to
the wants of the betting public, two books
laying prices and handling a raft of coin.
The 6' Kane challenge cup, the stellar
feature of the card, went to Alto \ ela,
an aeed son of Electioneer, driven by Dr.
G. W: Kleiser. A prcrounced favorite in
the betting, he took the first heat with
such apparent ease in 2:24 l i from Queenle
and Alameda Maid that 3 to 10 w&3 the
best obtainable when the field came out
for the second heat. A: the word the
brown horse quickly assumed the pole po
sition and. trotting like clockwork, again
came in by himself, the gray mare
Queenle once more finishing second. The
mile was covered in 3:19%, which is the
winner's mark.
Some unpleasantness was caused over
the result of the free-for-all, with King
Cadenza. 2:2Oti, and the old "wigglcr. '
Our Dick.. 2:0s 1 ;. as the only contenders.
The latter with Dan MIzner holding the
ribbons was made a 3 lo li) choice for the
first round, which he barely lasted long
enough to win in 2:1S I 4. A few contended
that Mr. Dunlap behind Cadenzo made a
weak drive, but it is probable he thought
his horse had no chance. At any rate,
the smart ones knew Dick all out. and
King Cadenza ruled a 1 to * chance for
the second heat, which he won hands
down in 2:22.
The Judees row concluded to change
drivers behind each of the horses. Mr.
Dunlap, owner and driver of King Ca
denza, would not listen to this proposi
tion, refusing to turn his pacer over to
the marshal, so the judges declared the
race off, awarding first money to Our
Dick.
Erratic but fast Prince C. proved the
cherry ripe one in the 2:3) class. Drop
ping the first heat, he then "stepped to
taw" in impressive fashion. The old horse
was heavily played to take the opening
heat, and when Mattie P. sneaked in first
ahead of Steve and Correct, the layers
of odds smiled, for it was one cf the few
good "breaks" they had. The two sue-

Corinthian and California Yacht
clubs* annual regattas were held yes

cessful. There was a good stiff sail
ing breeze and a moderate sea. which
made the conditions ideal for racing.
In the Corinthian regatta, which was
sailed over the usual channel course, nine
teen yachts completed the course without
rr.lshap. There were some surprises, thÂ©
most curioua Incident being that all the
yachts of the 23-foot class, including Corn^
modore Hawks' slocp May. finished with
the stakeboat en their starboard Instead
of on their port, as the sailing: directions'
clearly stated. In the special class for
yawls and schooners W. S. Grover's Arc
turus was dlsqualliied and Percy Burr'3
Kittlwake. among the 20-footers, fouled
the stakeboat at the finishing line.
In cla33 I the sloop Harpoon outfooted
all her competitors, the sloop Speedwell
finishing second. Among the 35-footers
,Emma was first and Vice Commodore E '
Â¦ F. Sagar's Edna second. In the 30-foot
class, which is always productive of the
keenest and most Interesting contest. Carl
Westerfeld's Aeolus beat her old antago
nist. ex-Commodore J. W. Pew's Truant
by a considerable margin, but Frank
Stone's Presto distanced them both. In
the special class for yawls and schooners
Spray took nrst place 'and Nereid second.
The whole 25-foot class was disqualified
for falling to leave the stakeboat at the
i finish on the port hand, as required by
the racing rules.
In the mosquito fleet Stella won a first
flag. The small boats In the 20-foot clas3
started at 11:45. ten minutes being given
them within which to cross the line. The

was taken at 12:10. The other classes
started at Intervals of fifteen minutes.
also having ten minutes within which to
cross the line. The one-gun start, though
more exciting and picturesque and from
the point v of view of a spectator much
more interesting, was abandoned because
of the dansrer of collision in the narrow

at anchor off It. The full results are

â¢ â¢ v â¢ â¢ â¢. 'â¢' Some of the distinguished members of the United
-.States.. Senate; .incline to the belief that ex-Senator
â¢ Clark of Montana constituted little more than a diver
sion f6r the public. The gentlemen probably forget
that 'the public does not take kindly to an indecent
-exhibition. â¢â¢-
Â¦- 'A Detroit convention of ministers is convinced that
our solemn duty placed- upon us by the glorious prin
ciple of .expansion is to work toward that goal where
we will assimilate with our new oriental citizens. The
U:vjercnd.'- gentlemen ought to start the game with
â¢-themselves in Chinatown. They will find that there is
irtill -some' .enchantment in distance.
The Examiner has again indulged its hat It of steal
ing the news. With that effrontery which charactcYizes
a hardened thief the yellow sheet has stolen one of
the reports of the famous surgeon. Dr.' George F.'i
Shrady, who is in this city at the instance of the New'
York Herald, and The Call to' investigate, the plague
situation. While The Call does not sanction theft ir
congratulates the yellow kid on his ability to distin
guish that .which, is worth stealing.
What will be the effect of the retirement of a man
so much esteemed cannot be conjectured at this time.
The Ministry on the whole' is conservative and has
been wisely directed.; Public sentiment in France will
be opposed- to any change of administration until the
exposition is over. It is probable the feeling of con
servatism will be strong enough to support the Min
isters against any attack that may be made upon
them. Nevertheless it will be felt that a serious loss
has been inflicted upon the Government, and /the
opposition will be encouraged to be more violent
than ever in their assaults.
Whatever may be the cause of his retirement, the
old General goes out of office with a record of which
he may well be proud. When he entered the Min
istry of War the French army was involved in the
Dreyfus scandal, and it seemed as if the taint of dis
honor were upon the whole War Department ami
general staff. He was unknown to politics, but from
his social pqsition and his character it was supposed
he would uphold the clique that was seeking the de
struction of Dreyfus. It was announced at the time
that the Royalists and all the reactionary elements in
France were jubilant over his appointment. In a short
time, however, he proved himself to.be one 'of the
soldiers who maintain the best traditions of -French
honor. He stood impartial at the trial, and when the
end came he set about removing from the staff "all "who
were in any disgraceful way .involved in the scandal.
He promoted and honored such officers as oh the
witness-stand proved that their conception of military
discipline did not require them to be false to truth
and justice. His task was to dear the army' and
France of the' whole miserable Dreyfus affair, and
for a time it appeared that he had succeeded, but
now on a mean side issue growing out. of that scan^
dal he. falls before the assault of a mere dude.
WITH the retirement of General the Marquis de
Gallifet from the office of Minister of War
the Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry loses the one
man who gave it prestige in countries outside of
.France. Whatever view may have been taken of him
by his own countrymen and by the majority of the
Chamber of Deputies, the old General appeared to
those who study French politics from a distance to be
the one clear-headed, pure-hearted, strong man of
the Ministry. It was expected that he would carry
his weaker colleagues safely through all troubles that
might arise, and prevent any change in the Ministry
until the exposition closed, and now, as another illus
tration that it is always the unexpected that happens,
he is the first to break down before the attack of the
opposition and resign.
The retirement is the. more curious because from all
we can learn in the dispatches from Paris it was
caused by an attack led by Count Boni de Castellanc.
Here is a case where a soldier of undoubted courage,
a gentleman of the highest lineage, a man of stain
less reputation and a statesman enjoying the esteeni
of the world is beaten in a contest led ,by a young
man whose vanities have made him the laughing stock
of two continents. It is as if a lion had been driven
from his post by a lapdog. Of course there is some
motive' for Gallifet's action which has not been made
public. The explanation of ill health is not regarded
as sufficient even in Paris. Something is going on
of which the world can only conjecture the nature,
for it is certain Boni de Castellane must have had
potent forces back of him to enable him to start an
attack which would drive Gallifet from the Ministry.
THE MARQUIS DE GfJLLIFET.
Some features of the case arc especially interesting.
It is stated that in opening his account with the gns
company Bayer yielded to the customary extortion
of a deposit and placed with the company the sum of
$S. Last year the company presented Bayer with a
bill for $9 10, and Bayer offered in payment the cer
tificate of the deposit and $1 10 in coin. The com
pany refused the tender and shut off the gas. Bayer
then stood upon his legal right and gave the company
a written demand for gas. The company yielded.
The first bill presented to him was for $10 20, and
once more Bayer tendered the certificate of deposit of
$8 as a part of the payment. The company, perceiving
it was dealing with a man who knows his rights and 15
not afraid to defend them, surrendered and accepted
the pa3 r ment. Bayer, however, having been subjected
to annoyance- and damage by reason of the company's
illegal actions, sued for damages provided by the
State law, obtained a judgment in his favor from the
Justice Court, and the judgment, as we have said, has
now been confirmed by Judge Hebbard.
The case shows th.it if the people submit any longer
to the extortion of the gas company they will have
rone but themselves to blame. The law is on the
side of the public and the courts are ready to uphold
it. The fact that the company surrendered to Bayer
as soon as he asserted his rights is a proof that it has
learned a lesson from the campaign which The Call
started in the interests of the people. It will not fight
any one who has the manhood to fight back.\ Now
let all who have been subjected to the extortions of
the company follow the example which has been set
them, and the vast sum of money which the company
has exacted illegally from the public will be returned
to its rightful owners. > where it can be used iti # the
trade and industries of the city instead of serving the
extortionate company as a source of dishonest profit.
It is now evident that the fight made by The Call
for the rights of the people has had a good effect.
"Men who know their rights and knowing dare main
tain" are refusing to submit to the extortion. Judge
Hebbard has just decided in the case of F. J. Bayer
vs. the San Francisco Gas and Electric Company that
the plaintiff is entitled to receive a supply of gas
without making a deposit, and that the company in
â¢ cutting off the gas supply of the plaintiff rendered it
self liable for damages, which in the # case before the
court were assessed at $20.
SOME time ago The Call in the performance oi
its duty to the public found it necessary to
point out the illegality of the action of the gas
company in compelling persons desiring the use of
gas to make a deposit with the company before it
would furnish the supply. Such deposits have been
literally extorted from the public, and in the aggre
gate constitute a large sum of which the company has
the use and from which it derives, a considerable
profit. Following the exposure of the fraud a test
case was brought. into the courts and judgment ob
tained against the company. An appeal was taken to
the Supreme Court, fcr the gas company, like other
corporations that practice extortions upon the pub
lic, will not surrender its illegal gains so long as it
can possibly retain them.
GflS COMPANY EXTORTION.
C^ ROM some, perverse motive the commissions
Â¦ appointed by Mayor Phelan to.adminster the
; .*' .'..Â¦: various departments of the city government have j
adopted a policy of holding executive sessions for the i
discussion of such municipal affairs as are under their
CDiJtrol. There is in this policy an evident desire to
the public the proceedings of the meeting, j
the practice be perrnitted to continue the peopis ;
:<jfSaii r Francisco will soon be unable to obtain any j
.ia fgrmatiq.il; concerning the work of municipal ad- j
ministration except that which the commissions are
Ajnlling/t^ TrJake known.'
There is oo; authority for the secrecy which has
been ! 'Syelj â¢Â¦hj'gh: â¢- universally adopted: The new charter
for good .reasons gives the Police Commission a
right to kfeep Â¦;Â¦ its proceedings secret, where it be
lievis secrecy to be of advantage to the service and j
the public welfare, but no other commission has such
a right. It was the intention of the charter makers
that publicity' in the transaction of. public business,
which is essential to popular government, should be
maintained, â¢ and accordingly they were careful to
specify, that the Police Commission only should have
the privilege of secrecy. . Â¦ .
It can be easily "understood that there are many j
matters^ tinder police . supervision which should be I
kep^ ..secret, .but. :vhy should the Civil Service Com-
Jnis^ionV the Election. Commission and the Board oi
Education, .for example, hold secret meetings? All
the -busmes's which such commissions have to perform
is a matter of public concern, and should be con
.ducred :so openly that all citizens may know what is
being, done and why it is done. .'
â¢Â¦;: : lit: is: a -self-evident proposition that unless the
Â¦'â¢voters know. what the Commissioners are doing and
by what meihods. they" are carrying on the affairs of
thc.cjty intrusted to them it will be impossible for the
' voters.- to determine whether jgood or bad service is
'given, .whether, honesty; or. jobbery prevails in the
eomrnissior.. Nor is.it to be forgotten that a resort
: to secret .sessions raises a suspicion that there is some
~thifig:the commission desires to hide from the public.
.. jf all be.' square and honest, why should not all be
. -open. .and above, board?
:Â¦:.. The issue is.'onc oT importance. Possibly and even
probably up to .this time no corrupt scheme has been
concocted in secret session by any of the commissions,
but it is nevertheless true that secrecy gives an oppor
tunity for corruption and affords a temptation to it.
The people have a right to know what the commis
sions are doing, and it is the duty of the press to'
guard that right. The sooner; therefore, the practice
of meeting in executive session and concealing from
the public what is done and said about public bust
ness is abandoned the better it will be for the com
missions themselves, for if once popular suspicion of
wrongdoing be aroused it will not be easilv allayed

has already cost the city a considerable sum in the loss of trade arj d business, and before
the alarm dies away it will cost the city and the State together a loss more than sufficient
to pay for Chinatown twice over. â¢
It will be economy to destroy Chinatown, but of far more value than economy is the
supreme consideration of human life. It is in the name of humanity itself that science de
mands the destruction of the pestilential quarter. â¢ The issue is not Qne for discussion, but
for action. There cannot be two sides to such a question. Clear the foul spot from San
Francisco and give the debris to the flames. >
DR. SHRADY'S signed statement, which we publish in full this morning, gives to
the people of San Francisco:the information that while no living case of bubonic
*<.*v plague is known to be in Chinatown, yet a corpse has been discovered in which
evidences of the disease are manifest. It further makes' known the fact that there is
nothing in the situation to justify a panic, but that the conditions are such as to impose
upon San Francisco as an imperative duty the thorough cleansing of the plague spot, even
if it have to be done by fire. . .
The words of Dr. Shrady should be (impressed deeply into the mind of every citizen.
He speaks with the authority of a well-won eminence in science, and with no other pur
pose than that of guarding the interests of the city and of humanity. He says:
"What seems to be necessary for San Francisco to do at the present juncture is to
empower the health authorities to draw the fire lines, so to speak, round the infected
buildings. Empty every infected house of its inhabitants. Keep the tenants in quaran
tine in some safe place, some house of detention, until all clanger from the disease with
them is passed. Then as to the house, let it be thoroughly disinfected that there shall be
no chance of any infection remaining. If that be impossible, then resort- to the radical
measure of burning. I believe the safest thing to do with any infected house is to take no
chance short of the firebrand. It may cost money, but what is money against human j
Such is the counsel science gives. What response shall San Francisco make to the
demand upon her? We. believe there will be but one answer: Clean out Chinatown,
clean it out thoroughly, remove the plague spot from the city, leave not qne of its foul
buildings standing, nor one of its dark, dirty, underground passages unclosed. Purify the
spot by destroying every Chinese habitation upon it.
The work which San Francisco is thus called upon to do is one that should have been
done long ago. Other cities in the United States and in Europe have cleared out their
slums by removing the disease infected structures that stood upon them. What we have
to do is, then, nothing extraordinary in the history of sanitary improvement. We have
only to follow the teaching of science.
In no city in the civilized world is there a slum more foul or more menacing than
that which now threatens us with the Asiatic plague. Chinatown occupies the very heart
of San Francisco. It i/a bit of the most degraded Asiatic filth set in the centey>f a city
of Western civilization. At best it has been a disgrace to the municipality and a source of
wonderment to travelers that it should be tolerated. * So long as it stands so long will
there be a menace of the appearance in San Francisco of every form of disease, plague
and pestilence which Asiatic filth and vice generate. The. only way to get rid of that
menace is to eradicate Chinatown from the city, and see to : it that in whatever quarters
the Chinese, take up hereafter they live above ground, in clean nouses, and with some re
spect for sanitary laws. f
To destroy Chinatown will of course cost money, but to permit it to remain will cost
more. The scare which now prevails over the discovery of a few sporadic cases of plague

An old custom applies the name of gym
nasium to the school. What is true, of "the
body is true of the mind. There is a
training for the mind and It Is the Fame
for all. The reason must be trained to
think aright, the will must be trained to
choose aright, the imagination must be ;
informed, excited or controlled. When
men have the power of reasoning correct
ly. When they have the knowledge of the
ideal and the habitual of aiming at it.
when they can express themselves with
a certain propriety and elegance, then
they are educated. Education is not what
they know.' but what they have the, power
to know; not, what they do; but what they
are able to/do. Education, therefore. Is
all round and symmetrical. To train the;
reason and neglect the will Is not educa
1 tion and a university that 13 compelled, to
set aside that ancient and only efficacious
training of the will, namely, the inculca
tion, of a definite religious belief, is de
prlved;of half Its power.- A- -university
that will : not teach Its students how to
think, and teach them how-to think itcan
not. without Is not a untver
sity at;all.';. It may have 500 professors and
as many courses, but it is not educating
those who come to Its halls. â¢ Â¦ *
i Just ?! the gefleral tracing Sfrtjffijggy,-
tion, but so develop them that when they ,
do go into action they may go in at a
maximum of efficiency. Is a prize-fighter
trained by being always in the ring fac
ing his opponent? Are there not a hun
dred things which he and his opponent
must do which seem to have no bearing
on boxingâ a hundred things *rom which
they must retrain, a hundred things
which they must suffer? Is not rest, is ,
not sleep as important to them as action?
They have certain physical powers, and
these physical powers are developed by
a wide and varied course of training In
"fcrder that at the proper occasion they
may have the ability to concentrate them
all on the one object.
Action is the worst possible criterion of
education. Why are children who are
sent to work too early stunted as to their
bodies? Why do plants which are forced
to unnatural activity lose their vitality?
Why does the field that never lies fallow
degenerate into a worn-out waste, breed
ing but thorns? There must be power
before there is action. All action exhausts
power, but premature action cramps it,
forced action blights it and unresting ac
tion destroys 1t.
True education does not consist in get
ting students to do things. Above all
true education does not consist in driving
students before their time into special
studies. The pigeon-hole system of edu
cation is the bane of our under-graduate
universities. All specialties narrow the
mind. If we go on di%iding and sub
dividing groups of studies at our present
rate of progress a new poet may arise, to
whom the exemplar of all narrowness
will not be the man with the hoe. but the
man of one book. We take a boy from
the grammar school and send him to a
special course at the "Great Universities.
He goes In for mining. He learns the
Greek names of a lot of rocks and several
methods for breaking them up and finding
out what is in them. It is true that
Greek names look more learned than the
plain monosyllables by which the farmer
designates the different' kinds of son on
his ranch, and chemical formula are more
imposing than the rule of thumb methods
by which the same farmer mixes his ma
nures: but between the two kinds of in
formation there is no real difference, and
one is of as much value as the other for
educative purposes. There is a difference,
of course, in the man. The farmer may
not be educated, and he knows that such
knowledge as he has does not make him
educated. The college boy may not be
educated, but. unfortunately, he thinks he;
Is. We have no right to do these things.
We have no right to constrict the minds
of youth as Chinese women do their
daughters' feet or Flathead Indians
their sons' skulls. It is a crime to de
ceive the young. There are "great In
stitutions which line up boys ami girls
and dose them with instruction in this and ,
instruction in that, and then say to them.
"Go out into the world: behold, ye are
educated." And God help them. They are
no more educated than the yokel who sits
on the fence is conversant with the man
ners and customs of every cow under the
jurisdiction, or the observant lad who
knows where, with a hfnt p!n and a piece
of thread, he can land twenty-one differ
ent kinds of fish of a forenoon.
All men are alike and all men are dif
ferent. The two propositions are true, but
not under the same respect. All mm are
alike physically because each Is built on
the same plan and like Shakespeare's
Jew, "fed with the same food, hurt with
the same weapons, subject to the same
diseases, healed by the same means.
warnnid and cooled by the same winter
and summer." All men are alike mentally
because their souls are created In the
same Image and likeness. Fundamentally
they think alike, will alike, plan alike,
dream' alike, just as they grow alike,
walk alike, .sleep alike or digest alike.
Men differ one from the other, but they
differ because they agree. One man has
blue eyes. another black, but both have
eyes. One man is slow of thought, another
nimble, but both think. Now in training
the body we do not begin by emphasizing
the accidental differences. A certain boy
may be weaker in his arms -than the nor
mal, another in his legs. We give both
special exercise to bring them up to the
standard, but we don't believe that the
one Is all arms or the other all legs. The
training of the body is the, same , for all
because the bodies of all are the same. In
later life a man may make a specialty of
exercises which demand a muscular torso
or good calves, but whether he is to be a
baggage smasher or a bicycle rider his
general training is one and the game.
More than that the moment he Degins to
specialize he has to fight the tendency to
deterioration experienced by the unused
organs. If he has been thoroughly de
veloped before taking to a particular kind
of exertion it will be easy for him to keep
himself in good all-round condition. If he
specialized -while he was immature he can
never be other than lopsided.

St. Peter's. San Francisco, May 30, 1900.
must go on during the plastic period and
continue until that period \s past, so the
general training of the mind must go on
duringxhe period of mental development
and continue until the intellectual powers
reach those symmetrical proportions,
which provide against future lopsided-,
ness. With all respect to Dr. Jordan,
that period Is not reached by the sopho
more. It Is a question if it is reached by
the graduates. Therefore the coltega
course is short enough for ! the general
training and the general training does not
require divergence to professional work
and a multitude cf special Instructors.
Hence Dr. Jordan's claim that the college
education given in Stanford University is
superior to the education given in the
b mailer colleges because Stanford can af
ford to have more professors is as rea
sonable as th9 claim that the plain bread I
buy in a bakery is worse than the same
bread bought at a confectioner's, whero
they sell also candy and ice cream.
A university is not a department storÂ».
It must have its professional schools, but
Its real work is dona not there, but in arts.
One can get a professional education any
where. One can get a college education
only at college. To sav that the col.'ego
education given at Stanford is better than
the college education given at St. Mary's,
because Stanford has professional schools
and St. Mary's has rone. Is claiming credit
under false pretenses. Yet this ia pre
cisely what not only Stanford, but all thÂ«Â»
so-called great universities, are Â«!oinsr as
regards the smaller colleges. The elairti
may not be made in so manv words
though the report of Dr. Jordan's talk on,
"The Higher Education of the Pacific
Coast" comes very near it. In his Sun
day interview he asserts that the large
universities "have many students because
they meet the needs of many." If the
large, universities obtain many college
students because they have many profes
sional schools they are deceiving the pub
lic. As a protest against that deception
I spoke at St. Mary's, for I believe It is-
Injurious to the interests of true education
and the common good. Tours truly.
THE REV. PETER C. YORKE.
ff F I understand Dr. Jordan aright he
takes It for granted that Berkeley and
jj Stanford are institutions of the higher
learning and that the smaller colleges
are smaller not only In the number of
their students but In the character of the
education they give. While he differs
from President Harper In matters of de
tail, he appears to accept the Idea under
lying the Chicago plan, namely, that in
some way the smaller * colleges gave an
inferior brand of education. He hints
that they do not perform what they pro
fess to perform and that the cause of this
lack of performance is want of means.
In dlscussingfXthis subject, it may be
well for the present to leave Berkeley out
of the question. It is the State Univer
sity, and perhaps as the State University
it may have advantages not enjoyed by
private corporations. Let us consider the
case of Stanford. Stanford University is
a private institution or college. .It stands
before the "people on precisely the same
level as St. Slm-y's College or the Univer
sity of the Pacific. This truth is ob
scured' by the size of Stanford and by the
ability and agility of Dr.' Jordan. Never
theless the fact remains: Stanford is in
the eyes of the State entitled to no more
rights or privileges than, for Instance, St.
Peter's parochial schools.
Hence if Stanford possesses any supe
riority over the smaller colleges that su
periority must arise either, because it is
bigger', or because it has better profes
sors, or because it gives more efficient
teaching, or because it teaches more sub
jects. . .
As to the first element, 1 am glad that
both President Jordan and Professor
Wheeler are convinced that there is no
virtue in mere bigness. It is a consola
tion to know that they are not enrolled
in the ranks of those who estimate every
thing-by size. Of course I said nothing
about a university "which would measure
God's mercy on a yard of stick." I did
not say something about a university that
would value education by . weights and
measures. There are Philistines who Im
agine that a big salary, a big building
and a big crowd make a big school. The
implied sneer in the terms "smaller col
leges" and "great universities" belongs to
their habit of speech.
As to the second elemept, it remains to
be proved that Stanford has better pro
fessors than the other colleges. I have no
desire to say a word derogatory of the
gentlemen who teach tit Palo Alto, but
they will be the first to admit that there
must be among them, as in every other
body, members good, members bad and
members indifferent. Up to the present
their work has not been such as to en
title them to any particular pre-eminence
among the other professors of California.
Of course I mean real work; not drum
whacking. .. . .
Moreover, I am not aware that the
method of appointing professors in Stan
ford is such as to guarantee that they
must be "real teachers." Dr. Jordan
waxes indignant at the at.tempt of cer
tain persons "to put" their own relatives
or dependents into places designed for
"real teachers." How In the name of
goodness are teachers appointed in our
two "Great Universities?" Is it not by in
fluence? Is it not by recommenda
tion? Is it not, in plain Anglo-baxon.
bv pull? I cannot see the slightest differ
ence In kind between the system of ob
taining lucrative employment in vogue
amons the "better classes" and the way
the "push" gets on to a fat job. There
is a difference in name, it is true, lhe
child of nature revels in metaphors sug
gestive of horse power and pile drivers.
The college president uses a more dlgnr
tied terminology, but he gets there all the
same. Â¦
Indeed, if we are to look to antecedent
probabilities, it is far more likely that
St. Mary's College, for instance, has the
superior staff. These brothers teach not
for the salary, but because they have a.
vocation to teach. That vocation is so
strong that they give up home ties and
associations, the comforts of life ana its
ambitions in order to follow It, and It
seems to me that a man's estimate of
anything is to be judged not from what
he gains by it, but Irom what he is will
ing to sacrifice for it. I do not mean to
say that vocation alone, or good will or
devotion will make the teacher, because
these things do not give brains and train
ing; but brains and training being sup
posed, a teacher of the type of the Chris
tian Brother stands head and shoulders
above the teacher of the type employed
In our "Great Universities."
As to the third element, it can be proved
by facts that the smaller colleges give as
efficient teaching as Stanford, for exam
ple. AVe can stand on the record. The
biggest men in California in every walk
of life are graduates of the small colleges.
It is not necessary to name names. Kv
ervbody knows the facts. A- college Is a
means to an end. A professor exists for
his students, not for himself. A fair test
of a professor, therefore, is the result of
his teaching as exemplified in the careers
of his pupils. I do not deny thai ill re-
EUltS sometimes follow the be.=t of . meth
ods. But I am dealing with the normal,
not with the odd. The record of the grad
uates, say of St. Mary's College, is the
best testimony of the efficiency of St.
Mary's College teaching.
As to the fourth element, the apprecia
tion of its value depends entirely on
â¢what we mean by education and on our
conception of the functions 'of a teaching
body. Dr. Jordan believes that a univer
sity is "a place where. a man can get in
struction in anything." Therefore it fol
lows to him that the more kinds of in-:
struction are given the bigger and better
the university," His criterion of educa
tion is the amount of instruction a man
can swallow, and any one kind of instruc
tion is as good as any other kind. He
"botanv is as noble â¢ a study as
Greek"; "it "is Intellectually more profit
able to study Greek ten years than to
study ten languages one year each"; "a
thorough electrician is better educated
than a quack doctor, preacher or profes
sor." ' Hence â¢ it naturally follows that
Stanford is superior to St. Mary's be
cause there are more professors in Stan
ford and the Stanford student, can be
stuffed earlier with Information and with
more variety. Says Dr. Jordan: "By the
time he is in his sophomore year the stu
dent ought to diverge toward his profes
sional worR. To enable him to do this re
quires a great teaching force; something
the smaller college cannot possess." Dr.
Jordan /believes in specializing the
studies thus early because according to
him knowledge is valuable only as it is
transformed Into action. "Whatever we
know " he says, "should be worked over
into action." The American university, in
his mind, is superior to German thorough
ness and English culture precisely be
cause the American university leads on
to work. It Is interesting as an index of
Dr. Jordan's habits of thought that there
are no European systems of education
worth mentioning save the English and
the German. Â¦â¢
Dr.- Jordan s Ideal of education seems
to ' me - to be raw, crude, shallow and
ineffectual. You might as well say that
a steam engine blowing its whistle is a
better engine than another at rest.
There is a difference between power and
action, - and the end of-, education is not
action, but power.
Dr. Jordan s use of the word education
is on all fours with, the popular appli
cation of the term to that deeply interest
ing animal of our youngrer days, the
educated pig. You can take dogs, mon
keys, horses, parrotsâ and I suppose even
the Belgian hareâ and teach them tricks
without number. These tricks are so
complicated, they are carried out with
such accuracy, they are performed with
such apparent spontaneity, ; that we feel
.ashamed to deny the clever performers
(the use of reason. Yet they are as much
puppets as the wooden dolls worked by
wires, except that the trainer uses the
living wires, the nerves that lead to the
stomach, and the nerves that carry sen
sation from the skin. Man is a beast, but
he Is more. He may be taught as manv
tricks as a monkey, but education does
not consist in teaching him tricks. in
struction is ' not education. Information
is not learning. Botany is not as noble
a study, as Greek. It may not be intel
lectually more profitable .to study Greek
ten years than to study ten languages one
year each. A thorough electrician may
not be as .well educated as a quack doc
tor. A thorough electrician may be Ju3t
as well - educated as a thorough brick
laver or a thorough cleaner of sewers.
Â¦ ilan has certain , mental faculties or
powers born. in. him, and 4 the end of edu
cation is not to put these powers Into ac-
Being the first of three articles written for The Call by the pastor of St. .Peter's
parish in restatement of his argument before St. Mary's College graduates to the effect
that a deliberate attempt is being made to create a monopoly in education in this State.

THE FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 31, 1900.
Since. Mayor Phehn lias.honqrcd us by thrusting
his victorious pen into the arena of literature it might
not be unwise for his Honor to consider what he is
eminently qualified to discuss â the scientific problem:
of how it feels to suffer from a total 'eclipse.'.
' The "boxers" of California must feel a certain kind

â¢The. industrious 1 correspondents are planning an
other, war between Russia and japan. The story has
been 4old so often that it does not now possess even
the interest of a clever fiction.
The old adage that there is luck in numbers must
appeal to Lord Roberts with peculiar meaning/ He
has entered the Transvaal with a force ten times as
great as the gallant foe he must meet.
Since Mayor Phelan's scheme to divert* the lodge
at Golden Gate Park from its legitimate purposes has
been defeated his Honor might favor the city by con
tributing to some other public institution the little
library in which, as The Call has already indicated;
he is personally concerned.

mother's grave the nexl day. After a
pleasant good-night Murray went to his

and her husband, who is a clerk in the
health office, observed a light in his room.
They presumed he was reading, which
was correct, as a novel was found on a

was discovered at 7:30 o'clock yesterday

the odor of gas, and' on opening the door

WARRING BOXERS
Rev. P. M. Royall, a Mission
ary, Arrives From Shan
tung, China.
Says the Hatchetmen Are Determined
to Wreak Vengeance on All For
eigners â Were Formerly
Peaceful. . .7 â¢
Rev. F. M. Royall, a Baptist missionary,
who has been in China for the past seven
years, arrived in this city with his wife
and child on the Gaelic yesterday and' is
registered at the Russ House. Rev. Mr.
Royall's missionary work was confined to
the province of Shantung, situated about
eighty miles from the headquarters of the
Boxers, who have been terrorizing the
country for the past two or three months
and who are now reported to be marching
on Peking. He says the trouble with the
Boxers commenced last summer and that
since that time they have become very ag
gressive. When he left Shanghai the gen
eral impression. was that they would over
run the country. At times they have mei
with repulses, as in the case of the at
tack on the Catholic village of Shantung,
but their large forcep are becoming the
cause of serious apprehension, especially
amonn the foreign element, against whom
they appear to exercise a decided an
tipathy.
â¢â¢The Boxers are a society known as the
Ta-Tao Whey, which translated means'
'Great Knife Society,'" said Rev. Mr.
Royall last night. "Their organization
was perfected long ago. but until recent
ly they never caused trouble or committed
depredations. Their first acts of violence
commenced when they attacked the
Catholic missionaries. An effort to sup
press them only served to turn them
against all foreigners and now vengeance
is visited upon even the relatives anti
friends of 'foreign devils, as they term
invaders.
"We believed all the trouble had sub*
dued after the murder of Dr. Brooks, an
Episcopalian divine, in the Honan prov
ince last December. Several lawless acts,
committed afterward, aroused our sus
picions, but Just previous to my departure
the spirit of friendliness manifested on
the part of the Chinese led us to believe
that no more trouble would arise. I was
surprised when I read the papers upon my
arrival in this city and found that foreign
soldiers had ben caleld upon to protect the
various legations.
"Excitement ran high In the province of
Tai-an-Fu. after the i murder of Mr.
Brooks and detachments of native troops
were detailed to protect all strangers in
the country. TheÂ«e soldiers had received
foreign discipline and their methods' sur
priseid the lawless element. Officers would
escort foreigners about the streets and
chat with them. "While this was not in
accordance with the dignity of the Chinese
army, yet it had the effect of impressing
the Boxers with the fact that their acts
did not receive- the approbation of the
Chinese officials and that the soldiers were
there to afford protection to the foreign
ers., cost what it might.
"Some of the acts of violence were not
committed by the 'Great Knife Society."
but by members of a band of robbers,

lives are devoted to pillage and plunder
and who rob and steal even in their own

ing the natives with munitions of war.
The- detective s^-stcm. which is now in

Department ; officials say that they have
riei expectation of any cla^h between the

/vvtll undoubtedly comply with its wishes,
making- such suggestions with respect to

that it has been appointed to estab

beyond the adoption of a number of reso

ments for Information bearing upon the
point covered by the Senate resolution.
The principal inquiries are to be directed
to the Secretary of War, but the Post
master General, the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Secretary of the Navy
are also to be required to throw such light
upon the subject as they can.
There was some discussion of the neces
sity of a visit to Cuba, but the conclusion
was reached informally that there would
be no necessity for such a trip until the
departments could be heard from and the
information supplied by them digested.

And this explains, too, something in tho
style of Dickons which has called forth
the remarks of critics. It is always sim
ple, often vivid and impressive, but ii
lacks distinctionâ it is not based upon tha
best models. His trick of dropping into
rhymeless verse In scenes where he la
very much in earnest betrays an ignor
ance of the real secrets of proso s*y|f-
There Is not a passage anywhere In his
works that 'will compare for beauty of
rhvthm and charm of diction with flft;'
that couM be culled from the pages of
But when all -this 13 said now much re
mains! Dickens left a great mass of
work, not all of it by any moans of e<iua
value., but all permeated by the essential
characteristics of his genius. First, per
haps, among these Is hi* immense vitality.
Dickens was alive to his finger tips. an-I
there Is a sense of power in his work tnat
denotes the master. Its very imperfec
tions, are in a way a testimony to Jtf*
strength. He was no painter of delicate
miniatures, but worked with a Droaa
brush, dashing off one masterpiece and
hurrying on to another, without stopping
to correct imperfections or put on finish
ing touches. Closely connected with this
vitality is his hjfniensÂ® power of Imagina
tion. It was in the true sense creative.
The people in his books are real to U3 be
cause in the process of compositi->n they
became real to iiim. He heard every word
they said, he has told us: he had but to
pit down at his desk and straightway he
saw Tet this imagination never strayed
from real life. It sprang from his own
prodigious knowledge of certain phases of
fife, of the great world-city of London an-1
the people that dwelt therein, of the little
provincial towns of Central and Southern
Ensrland. of the roads and stopping places
that linked these to the capital. He was
no Shakespeare, to reconstruct a world
he had never known. He had little sym
pathy with the classic or romantic past;
but what he himself had seen and felt hÂ»
could embody with a certainty of hand
rarely equaled. And this power of imag
ination shows Itself alike in description
and characterization. Ilia power of obser
vation enabled him to seize a scene and
convey It to us with a thousand touches
of exact description that make it more
than lifelike, that make it live. We can
taste the air of one of his London fogs.
And so. too. hi3 charactersâ that is to say.
the characters In which he was really
interestedâ arc alive. The unreal 1 char
acters of Dickens are for the most p?Â»rt
the unhappy product of his taste for melo
drama, and have no part in his creativg
power. But when this PotÂ« has free
play Dickens' hand is like that of the
great masters. And he has added to Eng
lish literature a greater number of char
acters that seem destined to immortality
than any author since Shakespeare.
If we try to count up those character*
it will be apparent that most of them
belong to the field of comedyâ Mr. Pick
wick and Sam Weller. and Bumble and
Sairey Gampâ but why attempt a list
whÂ»n so many clamor for adrtission" And
this shows most clearly wherlln the true
power of Dickens lies. He is the greatest
comic genius of this century. There arÂ«
comic figures enough In Thackeray, but
those that we remember best, Becky and
the colonel and Beatrix Esmond, belong
to another sphere of art. But Dickens,
destined from the beginning to add to the
gayety of nations, is at his best In com
edy, and he is master of every branch of
the art. Botsterous farce, laughing dia
logue, the finished comedy, of manners.
thÂ« bitter comedy of satire â we may draw
classical examples of each from his pages.
And when to this great and admirable
power we add the other qualities of the
man. his honest sincerity, his far-reaching
sympathy, his faith, his hope, h!s love.
w"e find no reason to wonder at hla un
bounded success In his own time â the
time. too. of Thackerav and Geor*e Eliot
and Hawthorne and charlotte Brontâ¬>â
and much reason to pltv thossA who in
these degenerate days profess to nave out
grown Dickens.
Few writers* of our century have put
more of themselves Into their work than
did Charles Dickens. Not only did he use
his own observations and experiences
make free with the characters of his
friends, introduce even his own parents in
more or less ridiculous roles, but h!s
whole work, from the "Sketches" to "Ed
win Drood." is an embodiment and expres
sion of himself. He actually proposed at
one time as the title of a periodical he
was ..planning,- "Charles Â¦ Dickens, Con
ductea by -.Himself,*'- and this title might
be given to the whole body of his work.
Certain characteristics of ;wi". when
grasped, explain, if they do not altogether
The Man and His Work.
In the last years of his life Dickens was
not only a most prolific novelist, but an
editor, a public speaker and an amateur
actor. He seemed possessed by a demon
cravinsf for employment. "I have now no
relief but action." he wrote to Foster. "1
am become, incapable of rest. I am quite
confident I should rust, break and die If X
spared myself.", Finally. In his desire for
action and sensation, he threw himself
upon the famous public readings, which
gave him the excitement he craved,
doubled his fortune and eventually killed
him. P0OT|BMM(RH
From this time on we note k change in
Dickens. Not altogether for the worse.
"Bleak House" stands very high among
his books. "Little Dorrit" and "Great Ex
pectations" contain some of 1:1s most fin
ished work and some of the later sketches
combine the old keenness of observation
with a new depth and wealth of experi
ence. It Is plain, too. that Dickens be
stowed more time and pains upon his later
work. His first books had been in effect
improvisations: they appeared as a rulo
in monthly numbers, and Dickens was
seldom far ahead of the printers" devil.
In 1S55 he began for the first time to take
notes for future work and to plan his
novels more carefully. But with the first
fine careless rapture much of the old
light-hearted mirth had taken flight.
There is. !n fact- a certain tone of bitter
ness In some of his later works which
is at once new and distressing. He expert
mented. too. not always successfully. In
unaccustomed methods. "The Tale of
Two Cities" Is a novel of pure Incident.
"Hard Times" a novel of unmixed
polemic. And. as always, he took upon
himself labor enough to crush a dozen
men.
His Later Work.
Selfishness In all Its forms, the national |
sin Of brag, the national sin of hypocrisy. ,
are held Â¦ up in Dickens' liveliest fashion
to scorn and ridicule. But. after all, it is j
not for the' moral purpose that we rernem- I
ber the book, nor for the confused and
Improbable plot, but for the high com- Â»
edy of the scenes at Todgers and in j
America, for the life and movement of the |
dialogue, and for the superb power Â«
character creation which reached its ,
zenith In the figure of Salrey Gamp.
We must of necessity pass overmuch i
of Dickens' work. The "Christmas Carol ;
tempts us to linger over its genial humor ,
and tender sentiment. "Dombey and Son
attracts us as much by the fun of Cap- I
tain Cuttle and the pathos of little Paul ;
as It repels by the melodramatic figures j
of Carker and handsome Alice. In some
of Its scenes from would-be high lire .
Dickens seems to be treading upon ,
ground belonging to a greater artist and
his work suffers by the inevitable com
parison. But in his next novel he is his I
inimitable self again and here he touches j
his highest point.
"David Coppcrfield" Is by far tho most t
popular of Dickens' books, and with rea
son Abandoning all pretense at a plot he !
here reverts to the old seventeenth cen- !
turv fashion of story-telling and -ives free
rein to his fancy in the creation of char
acter and the invention of incident. As
every one know?., the story of his own
earlv life and ctruggles is written large j
in this book and for this reason perhaps j
theie is in it a depth and sincerity of sen- i
timent thnt we miss elsewhere. For once
too the sta.?c villain and his unnatural
devices are banished. Steerforth. who In j
a measure takes his place. Â«s a very hu- ;
man creature, perhaps the best represen
tative in English fiction of a not uncom- i
mon type. Uriah Heep Is. no doubt, a
grotesque, but he has a reality which ,!.<Â» !
lacking in Dickens' earlier experiments in I
thi" direction. And just because the book :
lacks purpose, is not written to expose any
thaxn or to denounce any aburc, it is per- j
vaded bv a sunny geniality that can never .
fall to warm the heart. Human kindness i
Christian charity, the love of parent and ,
child cf husband and wife, rise clear and
strong above the clash of contending pas- i
sions.' and the. closing scenes are perhaps ,
the truest and tenderest in all the work of
Dickens He did much and much that
was good after "David Copperfield." but
never anything that was quite on the
same plane. /

Caledonian Club. It was one of the most
iraccessful gatherings, financially and

Dickens sprang from thÂ« loiver middle
class, and was practically uneducated.
His point of \ieTV. in consequence, while
often that of the man of genius, is never
that ot the born gentleman or ot the
scholar. He raised himself above clrcum
.'Â¦rances that- would have broken the spirit
of a weaker youth by his undaunted spirit
and indefatigable exertion. His sunny
temper, love of fun and infinite capacity
for seeing the humorous Bide of thlnwa
saved him from any bitterness that theae
circumstances miRht have entailed. Ha
was sincerely religious, and hla religion
was of a very pure. If not of a very intel
lectual, type. And yet there was some
thing wanting in Dickena. To put It brat
al'y. his manners had not that repose
which stamps the caste of Vere de \ere.
There is .Â«omethine which Jars the sen?e
in his impatient self-will, his restless ac
tivity, his desire to keÂ«-p on pood terms
with the publlâ¢. Probably no author Hv
ins would have thought It necessary to
issue the statement In regard tr> his sepa
ration from his wife that Dickens pub
lished in "Household Words." and some
thins of this Is seen in his work. He la

that "Chuzzlewit" was the Vst work he
had ever done, he was none the less ap
palled at Its comparatively unfriendly re
ception, and took Immediate measures to
stimulate the waning interest in his work.
He altered the propose', fate of Walter
<lay In "Dombey because he doubted "If
the public would stand It." Tet we must
not think that Dickens ever consciously
wrote down to his public. On t*ie con

CHIMING SOLE
OWNERSHIP OF
JULY FOURTH
During the ten years following th* first
appearance of "Pickwick" Dickens was
working at high pressure. "Oliver Twi3t"
was begun before "Pickwick" was finished
and "Nicholas Nickleby" was well under
way before the end of "Oliver" was in
sight. More "Sketches" of the old fashion
appeared; a weekly paper composed of es
says, sketches and short stories was un
dertaken; and when these failed to attract
two complete novels, "The Old Curiosity
Shop" and "Barnaby Rudge," took their
place. In 1S42 Dickena made his famous
visit to America, passed through the land
in a more than royal progress, and ve
hemently abused his hosts for their sins
in the matters of international copyright
and negro slavery. Shortly after his re
turn he began one of the greatest of his
works, "Martin Chuzzlewit." It Is per
haps underrated in this country, and not
unnaturally, seeing what vial3 of satiric
wrath its author pours out upon certain
American peccadillos. But we may at
least take comfort In the fact that tho
immortal Pecksniff is not an American
and never could by any possibility have
belonged to any other nation under
heaven than the English. The moral pur
pose runs strongly through this book.

ENGLISH FICTION.
CHARLES DICKENS AND ENGLISH FICTION.
ST. LOUIS, May 30.â All the pent-up
fury of the striking emploj-es of the St.
Louis Transit Company and their sympa
thizers seems to have been expended, for
yesterday's violent demonstration and
scenes of bloodshed were followed to-day
by a pronounced lull. Up to 10 o'clock to
night only one name had been added to
the Ions casualty list, that of Anton
Chalupsky, who was shot in the legs by a
policeman.'
Chalupsky and his wife were standing
at the corner of Twelfth and Emmet
streets during the progress of a small
sized demonstration near by. and Police
man HImeles told them to move on. Chal
upsky thought he had a right to remain
if he pleased, and so informed the officer.
A second order was given, and when Chal
upsky refused he says, the officer used his
baton on his head.
Chalupsky and his wife then assailed
the officer with a shower of brickbats.
One of them struck Himeles on the arm,
painfully injuring him. Himelps drew
his revolver and tired twice at Cnalupsky.
wounding him in each leg^ An ambulance
conveyed Chalupsky to tiH City Hospital;
where his Injuries were dressed. His j
condition is not serious.
Public interest in the strike veered to- ]
day to the special meeting of the Police
Board, called to devise heroic measures to
bring order out of the strained condition
of affairs. The board met during the |
afternoon and at once decided to call upon j
Sheriff Pohlmann to summon a posse
comitatus to assist in quelling the disturb
ances incident to the streetcar strike, he
having failed In his efforts to obtain 2C00
extra policemen to preserve law and or
der. !
The action of the board seems to have |
been precipitated by the four riots in the .
southern part of the city yesterday, dur- j
ing the progress of whleh eleven persons
received wounds. Sheriff Pohlmann was j
present and held a conference with the !
Commissioners. He said he had antici- I
pated such a call and had prepared a list j
of COO names. Including many of the lead- ;
inp citizens of St. Louis, on whom he :
would calf to serve as deputies.
After, the meeting President Hawes of;
the board said the dignity of the city and I
law both required that all local agencies
for the preservation of law and order j
should be Invoked before a demand were j
made upon the State to assist in preserv- j
ing order. *
The Commissioners had, he said, asked !
the Sheriff to summon a posse of 1000 men !
for this purpose and the Sheriff had prom
ised to enlist them by Friday morning,
i serving processes upon the best citizens.
If the first call for 1000 men did not prove
effective in the next few days the Com
missioners would. Mr. Hawes said, sum
j mon another thousand and put down dis
order in the city from whatever source it
might come, if it took ten tinies the num
ber of men usked for in the rirst call.

THAT San Francisco is not averse to
paying for a good show, the receipts
at the Columbia box office amply tes
tify. There is not a seat in the
house to bo had for "When We Were
Twenty-one," played by Maxine Elliott
and Nat Goodwin. This sparkling and
tender comedy of Haddon . Chambers is
possibly the most artistic play presented
here this season. The staging and inter
pretation leave absolutely nothing to be
desired. "When We Were Twenty-one"
will be the Columbia bill for next week
also. *
At the California Mr. James Neill and
nis talented company of players present a
varied programme for the week. This
afternoon by special request an extra
matinee will be given at which "Captain
Lettarblair" will be presented. To
night "A Bachelor's Romance" will be
played and â¢"Captain Swift" will be given
on Friday and baturday nights and ai the
Saturday matinee, which will be the fare
well performances of this admirable com
pany. Next week Dunne & Ryley's "all
star cast" with Hoyt's "A Rag Baby"
will open at the California. Tnis com
pany will play all of Hoyt's . standard
tarces during their season of ten weeks.
Among the performers are Mary Marble,
Bessie Tannahill, Lizzie Kirwan, Marion
Gunning, Maude Courtenay, Philip H. Ry
ley, Tony Hart, John W. Dunne, Matthews
and Bulger, Wiseman's Serenaders, an
excellent male quaret; the eight Mascots
and the "pony ballet," the success of
â¢â¢The Man ln the Moon" in New York last
Â¦season.
"The Three Guardsmen" at the Tivoli is
nightly iilling the house. The sabot
dance, with Ferris Hartman as a tow
haired flshermalden, is irresistibly funny,
and there Is an educated donkey in the
cast which arouses much merriment. The
singing by Frances Graham of "So Pure,
So Sweet, So Fair" Is much admired. "The
Geisha" and other popular operas are in
course of preparation and Edwin Stevens,
who has returned to the city, will appear
shortly upon the boards at this house.
Clyde Fitch's domestic comedy, "A Su
pernous Husband," is the Alcazar pro
gramme for the week. Florence Roberts'
"Sapho" will be the attraction next week.
The Orpheum presents an especially at
tractive programme this week. Miss Lil
lian Burkhart's refined and altogether
satisfactory performance continues to give
much pleasure. Her dainty humor and
keen appreciation incite the hope that
some day she may lay hands on a play
which will allow full scope for her capa
bilities. Ezra Kendall, in the third week
of his engagement, still commands a
hearty Interest and the rest of the bill is
all variously good. Â¦ .
The Lambardi Opera Quartet and SIgnor
Abramoff. appear in acts from' "Lucia"
and "The Huguenots" at Fischer's this
week. These clever Italians pack the
house nightly and. some of the best music

YOUNG woman's life may be the
Jl cost of a fire .that occurred In the
jj \rear of the dwelling at 1900 Mission
street yesterday afternoon shortly
before 5 o'clock. Miss Emily Peres, who,
with her parents, occupies the dwelling,
was probably fatally burned. , Charles
Keeslng. .who was unintentionally the
cause Of the young woman being burned
and whose subsequent prompt action
Eaved her from being - roasted to death
before the eyes of the startled onlookers,
was also painfully . burned on the hands
and arms and the agony occasioned by his
hurts completely prostrated him for sev
eral hours. â¢ '
Just how the fire that resulted so se
riously started is not known. Shortly be
fore 6 o'clock a young man ran Into the
store at the corner of Fifteenth and Mis
sion streets where Keesing is employed,
and shouted that the flat overhead was
ablaze. Keesing ran to. the rear and up
the back stairs. Just as he reached the
scene of the fire Miss Peres ran. into the
yard. Keeslng caught up â¢ a can of oil,
around which the lire was beginning to
lick Its way, and- hurled it through the
door. It exploded In midair and the blaz
ing contents completely enveloped Miss
Peres.. â¢ -
With a scream of terror the young nro-
man rushed through the rear door of the
store and toward the street. Keeslng
turned from the fire -and^'hurrled to her
assistance. Just as she 'reached the side
walk her limbs cave way and she sank to
the sidewalk. Her clothing was ln flames
from bust to ankles, but Keeslng grasped
her, and carrying her. to -a water trough
near the curb, completely Immersed her,
thus extinguishing the flames that en
veloped her. He then, with the assistance
of a bystander, carried her to the flat
above, the- rear of which was still burn-

An alarm was sounded and Â¦ when the
streams were finally playing on the flames
Keesing turned his attention to his, own
Injuries. By this time they, had become
so painful that the patrol wagon was
summoned and the Injured man was taken
to the Receiving. Hospital. There his
burns were dressed and under the-influ
ence of a sedative he rested; at the hos
pital for several hours and was then sent
to his. home,. 790 Ellis street.',- . .
As soon as the flames were extinguished
-at the Peres â¢ home Dr. Alderman was
Â¦summoned from the Railroad -Hospital' to
care for the young woman. She had re
gained her consciousness - a few minutes
after the accident and her suffering was
Intense. Her condition Is critical. .The
damage to the. dwelling is not great, but
for a time the flames threatened to de
stroy It and adjoining properties. :;

The most . Interest v aroused by the
Meade's arrival of course centers about
General Otis, who is on his way to Wash
ington burdened with portentous mat
ters for the cbnsideratlon of the Presi
dent, before whom he is to appear as soon
as 'he can reach him. General Otis Is in
good health, according to 'reports from
the ship last night. His one paramount
desire at present Is to get East in a
hurry. Unjess some special dispensation
is made permitting him to land he will not
commence his" overland Journey very
soon. Special efforts will be made to get
him ashore without long delay.
There are forty-nine cabin passengers on
the Meade and 134 in the steerage. She
carries. 112 dead bodies. There was one
death on the way over.
Federal Quarantine Officer Klnyoun
stated last night that he did not know
how long the Meade would be in quaran
tine, nor when General Otis would land.
General Otis returns to America for a
much-needed rest after nearly two years'
absence on probably the most arduous
and trying duty that fell to the lot of any
officer engaged in the Spanish or Phil
ippine wars. At Â¦ the outbreak of the
Spanish-American war General Otis, then
a brigadier was acting as president of tho
court-martial engaged in the trial of Cap
tain Oberlin M. Carter, at Savannah, Ga.
On May 2S, 1898, he was 'commissioned ma
jor general of volunteers and assigned to
duty as commander of the Department of
the Pacific. On July 23 he sailed from San
Francisco for Manila with reinforcements
for General Merrltt, and when that offlcar
was ordered home in September following
General Otis succeeded : him . as com
mander-in-chief of the American forces
in the Philippines and Governor General
of the islands. In that capacity he had
control of the very delicate relations with
Acutnaldo and his people, which were fin
ally ruptured on- February 4 of last. year
by the Filipino attack on the Americans
at Manila. The war which was then be
gun, and has continued' ever, since, was
directed generally and in detail by Gen
eral Otis from Manila, .where he resided
in the palace of the late Spanish Governor
Generaly while at>the same time he was
perfecting and inaugurating a system of
civil government for such parts of the isl
ands as -came under .American control.
That the work was done to the satisfac
tion of the President, and his Cabinet Is
shown by the fact ; that he was kept at
his post until his health forced him to ask
for.leave of absence:
. ; General Otis is a little over 62 years of
age, having been born; March 25, 1S38, at
Frederick, Md.; He studied and practiced
law for two years "when 'he entered th<3
army" as captain of the One Hundred and
Fortieth New York Volunteers, Septem
ber 13, 18C2, He served : through the cam
paigns of the Army of the Potomac with
distinction, winning brevet; brigadier gen
eralship.'and later being: made lieutenant
colonel of - the Twenty-second United
States Infantry.. He served in the cam
paigns against Sitting Bull and was large
ly Instrumental Mn bringing that chief to
terms. On March ! 31, < 1880, he ,. was 'made
colonel - of the Twentieth Infantry, and
November 23, 1S93." commissioned brigadier
general aver the heads of several officers
of much longer standing ln the service.
