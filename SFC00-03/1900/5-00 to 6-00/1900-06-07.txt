Russia and Japan Will Fight.
VANCOUVER, B. C. June 6.-Admiral
Sir E. C. Fremantle, for years in'charge
of the India and China- squadrons and
now commander-ln-chief at Devenport,
arrived to-day on his return from a tour
through the Orient He said that he
thought Japan and Russia would surely
fight. At any rate, Japan would never
back down. The feeling was so intense
there that no Ministry, could or would give
in to Russia, Korea,- he said, should be
long to Japan and the Japanese knew it
and would fight for it.
When questioned as to what part Eng
land would take In the struggle he said
that being "off duty" he could make no
statement whatever as to England's prob
able course In the event of war, but he
said that Japan was in the right, that
she would fight and she would win.
"When told of the recent massacre of
f ,-Rear Admiral Kempff , TJ. S. N. ?
British missionaries Â¦ and of Japan's pro
test' against Russia sending in more
troops, he said:, "That greatly Intensifies
the situation, but you can understand how
I do not wish to commit myself."
Russian Engineers Murdered.
LONDON, June G. â A special from
Shanghai dated June 6 says the members
of the majority of, the legations at Pe
king, including the members of the Brit
ish legation, are sending their families
away. It- is also said that several promi
nent Chinese residents .are leaving the
city. There, is an unconfirmed report that

The above picture from the London Graphic shows the passage of the men landed from the foreign war vessels at
Tientsin for the protection of their respective consulates on the occasion of the coup d'etat in October," 1593, through the
Eroat rate that connects the Chinese -with rtie Tartar city. In front were a body .of thirty-five Cossacks, followed by
Muejaekets and marines of the several nations, in all about 300 in number. The occasion was remarkable in that it was
' the Srst time that any .foreign troops have entered Peking since ISCO, when the British and French allies' marched
through the came grate, and after sacking the summer palace dictated their own terms to the Chinese Emperor. The
> Americans and others just larded at the request of the several Ministers had the same experience of delay at Tientsin
and followed the same route into the city, where they are now on dutyâ three hundred men among a million and more.
NEW YORK, June 7. â Serious alarm was caused in London and Washington' by" the Chinese advices yes
terday indicating an imminence of a clash between Russia and Japan." Leading financiers met in the
British, metropolis to prepare for a possible break. in the market.. ,
In "Washington, the Helena cr some similar light-draft gunboat -was ordered to Tientsin. It was
stated that should Hussia attempt to override Japan's protest against the landing of a preponderating force,
the United States might join with Japan in objecting. Minister Conger was instructed to act in unison with
the representatives of the powers for the protection of foreign life and property.
Shanghai had alarming rumors of a hurried mobilization of Japan's fleet. It was alleged that the Jap
anese protest had stopped the landing of the Russian troops at Taku, a clash between the two powers being
regard-ed as inevitable if Russia had persisted. The Russian Minister was reported to have made another effort
to induce China, formally to request Russian aid, but no answer has been received.
Soldiers dispatched to attack the "Boxers" fought an engagement close to Peking, many being killed
en both sides.
Fresh, outrages by "Boxers** were reported and the damage done to railways by them to date was esti
jrtated at S5.OOO.OOO. Foreign representatives in Peking were sending their families away and two Russian
engineers had been murdered, it was asserted, after their- wives' had been outraged.
PEKING. June 6.â The situation is
growing steadily worse. Events
move with such rapidity and af
fairs, owing to the excitement of
the natives, are so critical that the
foreign ministers hold frequent meet-
Ings. They feel the reed of a free hand
for energetic action, without a perpetual
reference to the -home governments.
Sir Claude Macdonald. the British Min
ister, is wiring lor seventv-five more ma
rines Native employes who have return
ed from Feng Tai say they left the Box
ers openly drilMi-.s In the adjacent village.
A strong imperial edict issued this even
leg censures the "cowardliness of the lm
r4-ial troops" and orders the Viceroy of
PecMU and General Jung Lu immediately
to suppress the Boxers.
The foreign ministers at to-day's meet
ing discussed the meeting in special audi
ence with the Empress Dowager, but no
decision was rfuched.
. Situation Grows Worse.
â¢WASHINGTON. June 6. â Minister Con
ger cabled to-day that the sif^ation at
Peking was worse, and this statement,
taken In connection with Admiral
Kempff's alarmice cablegram of yester
day announcing that an engagement had
txyrun. decided the State Department to
strengthen the- naval forces nearest the
scene of the trouble. Accordingly a ca
blegram was sent to Adrnfral Remey at
Manila directing him to dispatch at enco
to Admiral Ivcmpff's command toe gun
boat Helena or a correspondingly -light
draft chip, AdraJral Kempff's flagship,
the Newark, drawing 23 feet of water,
cannct ascend the Pciho River safely be
yond the Ts-ku forts, near the entrance,
but the little Helena, drawing only 11 feet,
can safely so to Tientsin, forty miles
above. She .was especially designed for
service in these Chinese rivers, and so is
likely to prove much more effective than
any other of the foreign warships which
can pass the Taku forts and reach Tien
tsin. She carries a battery particularly
adapted to dealing with such half organ
ised mobs as the "Boxers.",
She Is commanded by Commander
Moorn. and her complement Is ten officers
and IOC rnen. In view of the service asked
of her it is expected that Admiral Rcmey
will add to this one or two companies of
marines.
Selena a. Welcome Addition.
It is gathered from Admiral KerapfTs
advice* that the "Boxers" are about to
attack Tientsin, bo that the Helena will
be a particularly welcome addition to the
foreign fleet In that part cf China. If she
leaves Manila to-day she should reach
Taku next Sunday night or Monday morn
ing.
Secretary Hay cabled Minister Conger
an authorization to call for reinforce
ments from Admiral Kempff and to make
such disposition of. his naval force as he
deemed proper to protect American inter
ests generally.
The administration is still determined
that the United States Government shall
continue on its independent course re
specting the Chinese situation, though
willing to go as far as possible to aid in'
the restoration of peace and order in
China. Therefore Admiral Kempff has not
been instructed to join the other naval
commanders In the Peiho River in con
certed action. Â¦ Â¦ ,'.â¢..
No American Hay Be Safe.
The friends' of the American mission
aries in the disturbed zone In China are
becoming alarmed and the State Depart
ment is beginning to feel the pressure of
their efforts to adopt an aggressive policy.
To-day inquiries were made as to the rea
son for the passive attitude of the United
States naval forces in China while the
Russians are reported to have promptly
sent out military expeditions from Peking
: for the rescue of Russian. French and
Belgian subjects whose safety was Jeop
ardized. It was argued that the United
States marines should have been likewise
dispatched to the assistance of the Amer
lean missionaries at Paotingfu. The de
partment's answer was that Minister
Conger being on the scene was better pre
pared than any one here to adopt relief
measures, for which he had received the
sanction of the department in the . shape
of a general authorization to protect
American interests, which of course
meant American lives among other things.
It also was questioned whether the very
small force of .marines at the; Minister's
command could be used to make a march
through the hostile country and away from
Its base. In that case the United States
legation, the only refuge In the event of an
outbreak in Peking, would be unsafe for
American refugees, as well as for the
United States Minister himself, for the
lack of a suitable guard. Meanwhile the
developments are being closely watched,
and if the next phase should bo still worse
it is ' probable that in addition to the
Helena at least one more warship-i-pos-
Fibly the Princeton, with a full battalion
of marinesâ will be ordered up the Pelho
River to Tientsin. So far the proposition
to call upon General MacArthur for troops
to make up a landing party has not been

or two the tired troops of Lord
Roberts' army are resting and he is
filling the magazines and warehouses at
his new base, Pretoria, preparatory to a
long chase after the retiring Boers in
the direction of Lyder.burg. /His cavalry
are probably seeking to intercept Com
mandant General Botha.
Some dispatches are to hand which left
Pretoria Monday while the fight' ng was
going on outside the my. They come b;
way of Lourenzo Marques. Or.: of them
says :
"Toward the end of the day, when the
British naval guns were shelling the
southern forts, a number of projectiles
burst, damaging the suburbs. All day
armed burghers have, "been leaving Pre
toria, going east. The greater part of the
railway rolling stock has been removed.
General Botha's Tactics.
"General Botha was fighting an essen
tially rear guard action, his object being
not to defend Pretoria, but \o delay Lord
Roberts until the railway switch had
been cleared and the main part of the
Boer army had started to withdraw. The
British advance appears to have left open
to the Boers the best line of retreat aiong
the railway."
Possibly Lord Roberts may have been
able to cut the railway before a full re
tirement was effected. That Pretoria
would be defended was apparently given
out after the council of war with a view
of misleading the British.
Lydenburg, the district to which the
provisions originally destined for Pre

cartridge factory has been erected and
where reserve supplies of all sorts are
stored, is a volcanic region of fertile val

when there were public measures de

Nicaraguan canal bill, the anti-trust bill
and the eight-hour bill.
WASHINGTON, June 6.â A carefully
prepared statement on the appropriations
of the session was made fo-night by Sena
tor Allison, chairman of the Senate Com
mittee on Appropriations, and Chairmarf
Cannon of the House Committee on Ap
propriations, in accordance with custom.
The statement says:
The appropriations made by the first session
of the Fifty-sixth Congress amount to $709.
729,476. This sum Includes $131,247,155, esti
mated to be on account of or incident to the
late war with Spain and deducting it the re
maining amount, $J7S,4S2,321, represents the
ordinary appropriations made for the support
of the Government during this session.
It will be observed that after deducting the
amounts estimated to have been appropriated
on account of or incident to the war with
}-"pain for the ensuing, the current and the
last fiscal years (which cover the period since
the beginning of the Spanish war) the appro
priations for the five fiscal yearsâ including the
two immediately preceding the warâ are as
follows: , . Â¦-.'Â¦Â¦
is97, (sa.sa.tu: isss, $528,735,079; is93, $532,
373.6SS: 1900, S5J4.27S.S66: 1901. J37S.4S2.321.'
This flwws an apparent exce*s in the or
dinary appropriations at this session for the
fiscal year 1901 of $-19,747,242 over the appro
priations for the fiscal year 1S9S, which im
mediately preceded the Spanish war. The chief
increases in ordinary expenses for 1901 over
those r<">r 1S9S are:
Increase of the navy, $7,0Sl,9l6; pensions, $3,
981(350; postal service, exclusive of newly ac
quired territory. $17,7S2,900; twelfth census,
19.000.000; permanent appropriations (including
$2.(X<i,noo for requirements of sinking fund and
$4.090. too for redemption of .national bank
notes), $6,634,000.
The total of thefe Increases Is $50,202,826.
These increases in Fi*leral appropriations need
no defrr.se and hut a word of exDlanation. The
amount for the Department of Aericulture is
only a proper compliance with the natural
demands of the agricultural interests of the
country. For tensions the amount simply rep
lesents the natural increase of the pension
roll. For the increase of the navy the excess
over the appropriations of 189S Is necessary for
the construction, armor, armament and equip
ment of battleships, cruisers, gunboats and
torpedo-boats heretofore authorized and Is no
more than is absolutely necessary toward plac
ing the navy expeditiously in the proper con
dition universally demanded by the iworle for
the rational defense.
Much of the natural increase in the Treas
ury, War and Navy departments Is incident to
the war with Spain, although no part of it is
included In the table which is submitted of
increased appropriations on account of the war.
Under permanent appropriations, aside from
J6,000,000 for Interest on {he war loan, two
considerable increases appearâ one for ?4,000,0ty
for the redemption of circulating notes of na
tional banks out of funds deposited with the
treasury for that purpose, the transaction be- 1
ing purely one of bookkeeping and in no way
affecting the public funds. The amount of es
timated redemmions out- of banks' funds is
simply $4,000,000 greater than in 1S3S, and by
process of bookkeeping that amount is added
to the appropriation for 1501.
An increase of $2,000,000 is made in the
amount estimated to meet the requirements of
the Finking fund for 1901 over the sum esti
mated and included In the appropriations for
1S9S. This increase is on account of the Span
ish war loan of t2OO.OCO.00O.
The approximate amounts, .as nearly as
they can be arrived at.TappftjjB-iated oh ac
count of or incident to th.s war with Spain
during each of the three sessions of Congress
heH, since the beginning of that war are, set
fortTr in detail. The amounts thus appropriated
curing the two sessions of the last Congress
covered the period to the close of the ' fiscal
year 1000 and aggregated $4*2.562.0S3.
Of this whole sum it is estimated byÂ» the
Treasury Department that to June 30 the total
expenditures will not exceed $392,000 COO leaving
a surplus of $90,000,000 after meeting outstand
ing obligations to be covered into the Treasury
Thus, for the conduct of that momentous war
and its resultant effects Congress amply made
appropriations, and the administration has
wisely and prudently made expenditures from
the liberal sums thus placed at Us disposal.

RESUME OF THE
APPROPRIATIONS
BY CONGRESS
T X 7 ASHIN6TON, ; June 6.â Inability
\ A / to reach an agreement .on the
II 1/ naval appropriation bill forced
i I/- V"' -the Senate to abandon the
_* *..'. adoption of the House resolu
tion for final adjournment to-day. The
armor plate question, which for five years
has been a thorn 1 inthe side of Congress,
upset the- calculations cf thel Senate lead
ers and their well-laid plans went awry.
.It' was a day' of strife and turmoil in
the. Senate.' Early the conferees on, the
naval : bill reported a disagreement, and
the Senate was told plainly that the
House. would not consent to the amend
ment providing for an armor plate fac
tory tp be operated by the Government.
A compromise proposition was presented
by Penrose of and after
houis of debate finally was adopted by a
vote of 39 to -25. .The discussion of the
proposition deveioptd^an. unusual bitter
ness of feeling, and charges of robbery
and political corruption were hurled about
the chamber with an abandon which, if
they had not fallen from lips of grave
Senators,', would have been regarded as
reckless. Little worse ever was heard
in the heat of a political campaign.
Three o'clock, the hour agreed upon for
final adjournment, was passed and Kill
the Senato wrestled with thÂ« armor ques
tion- When the Penrose proposition final
ly was agreed to it was supposed the- way
was clear, but late to-night another disa
greement'was reached on the naval- Din
and the Senate took an adjournment until
II o'clock to-morrow morning. â¢
The evening sessions presented a brill
iant scene, the galleries being thronged
with a gay and fashionable assemblage.
All were immensely entertained, as sena
tors-Carter of Montana, Mason qi lin- j
nois. Turner of Washington and Money
of Mississippi kept the Senate on edge
with. rattling political speeches.
At 10 a. in. tho' Senate reconvened to
prepare for final adjournment. A Â¦â¢score
of Senators only were present, but the
chamber rapidly filled.- The naval and
sundry Civil appropriation bills remained
in conference, all the others having been
"The usual routine business practically
was abandoned to-day. Only two or three
new bills and resolutions were presented.
Carter secured the passage of a bill pro
viding for an Increase of $3<o,000 of tlie
â¢limit of cost of the public buildings at
Helena, Mont. - . ..
A recess was then taken to await the
presentation of conference reports. When
the Senate reconvened at 10:o0, aiu
son reported from the Committee on Ap
propriations the House concurrent reso
lution providing for final adjournment at
3 p. -m.* to-day. The committee had made
no amendment. It was permitted tem
porarily to lie on the table.
Hale presented a conference report on
the naval appropriation bill. It was a
disagreement upon all questions that have
been in dispute for three or four days.
Hale explained that the armor-plate ques
tion was- the" great stumbling block to
agreement. .No price had been agreed
upon bv the conferees because the House
conferees believed the price should be left
to the discretion of the Secretary of the
'Navv; % Hale said Penrose had a propo
sltlUE to offer which he Â¦ would be glad
to have the Senate pass. upon.
Â¦ Percros*: then offered the following prop
â¢ "That â¢ thte Secretary' of tho Navy is.
hereby authorize^ to procure by contract
armor of tho best quality for any or all
vessels above referred to, provided such
contracts can be made at the price which
is now, in his judgment, reasonable and
equitable, but in case he is unable to
make contracts for armor under the above
conditions he is hereby authorized and di
rected to procure a site for and to erect
thereon a factory for the manufacture of
armor, and the sum of $4,000,000 is hereby
appropriated toward the erection of said
factory."
There was a sharp arid extended debate
previous to the adoption of the Penrose
amendment. Senators Tillman, and Teller
attacking it bitterly and Senator Hanna
defending it. .
Butler said that what he wanted was a
Government armor-plate plant and he
would be willing to pay almost any price
for armor that is needed now, provided
that the construction of armor-plate by
the Government were made mandatory. ,
Chandler objected to leaving the matter
to the discretion of the Secretary of the
Navy. Congress ought not, he main
tained, to shift the responsibility to the
shoulders of the Secretary of the rxavy.
That would be a cowardly thing to do.
A bill was passed appropriating $o5,000
for the payment of the salaries of the of
ficials of the district of Alaska.
Debate on the armor question was then
resumed. Perkins, a member of the Is aval
Committee, supported the original com
mittee proposition. He' did not approve
of leaving the matter to the discretion of
the Secretary of the Navy.
Tillman attacked the amendment , by
Penrose. , _
The chairman of the Naval Committee,
said he, has declared that the Government
is being robbed and that the trust has a
knife at the Government's throat. The
country, he said, was face to face with a
scandal as enormous as any in its his
tory, second not even to the great Credit
Mobilier scandal;
"I resent, that statement," interjected
Penrose, vehemently and with evident
feeling. "I resent the statement that
there is any suspicion of scandal ln^this
or any amendment which. I propose.",
"I am making no personal allusion, re
plied Tillman. "I am simply stating facts
that are indisputable.. The influences be
hind the public in this matter are the
shipbuilders and armor-makers."
Teller denounced the amendment of
Penrose as a disgraceful proposition.
"As the Senator from New Hampshire
said," continued Teller, "It would be cow
ardly and craven on the part of Congress
to surrender legislative authority and
prerogative to the executive branch of
the Government. It seems to me there
may be a tinge of corruption. This is a
time for plain talk. The Americans be
lieve and I believe that there is a great
political combine behind this proposition
to surrender our authority."
. "I do not believe," said Teller, "that
any scandal in our history will equal that
which will grow out of a surrender now to
this robber combine. The Cuban scandal
and peculations would be a minor matter
as compared with those which would oc
cur under the influence of these monopo
listic armor-plate robbers." ' '
He said the proposition of Penrose had
not been adopted without a thorough un
derstanding by the American people that
they were being robbed.
- "The bitterness of the Senator from Col
orado." said Hanna. in reply to Teller,
"excites only my sympathy. The animus
of the matter is the determination on the
part of n few men to have a Government
armor factory built. To this end every
thing else is to be sacrificed." â¢ Â£*8SSBÂ»*^
In response to a suggestion Hanna said:
"I want to see this armor question taken
out of the legislative branch of the Gov
ernment because I want to see it taken
out of politics.' In advocating this dispo
sition of the matter I resent the charge of
the Senator from Colorado that anybody
has been or will be Influenced by motives
lower than those by which the Senator
says he is actuated." ", " .
Hanna said the r-r-tary of the Navy
should be left discretion to act as he saw
best. As for Teller y ass "tlon that the Re
publican party wjis f- king long chances
when they put themselves in the attitude
of defending what he styles the armor
plate trust, lie (Hanna) I was sure the Re
publican party would not shrink from the
responsibility, of doing business on sound
business principles. The party did not
propose. to be driven into, the manufacture
of armor plate simply to please their crit
ics.': He was sure that all these opposition
speeches were for mere political effect,
and he wanted it understood that the op
posing Senators had no. patent on integ
rity and honesty. Â¦
In conclusion Hanna advocated the Pen
rose proposition as a fair compromise, v:,
Tillman said that if the bill should fail
the responsibility would be.on the House
of Representatives. '
Hawley entered a protest against the
Charges of Robbery and Politi
| eal Corruption oniArmor
Plate/Amendment.
criticism of public men. characterizing it
1 as - "treasonable"" and as â¢ "villainou3
pessimism." He advocated the Pcnrose
compromise.
Daniel opposed thePenrosc amendment
and. urged the Senate to stand up to the
nght which had been on for: five years.
Hanna and Elkirs, he said, had demanded
.with,, tiresome iteration business should
be conducted on "business principles," but
ho had- never heard that business princi
ples demanded that the buyer t-houid
place himself entirely in the hands of the
seller, or that a man should employ an
agent to do for him that which he could
not do for himself.
"Why," asked Daniel, "did the armor
plat? manufacturers decline, to tell the
cost of the production of the armor plate
when asked by the Senate/ Committee?"
I'enrose asked permission to reply, to
this inquiry, . and began by referring to
Daniels speech as a "reckless statement
and demagogic appeal."
. Daniel resented this characterization
and refused to yield further. Such lan
guage, he considered, was unbecoming to
[ the" Senator and to the Senate.
Continuing, Daniel urged that there was
no emergency that should render it so
necessary to hurry the construction of the
navy, as not to take time to do that which
should be done in the interest of the pub
lic welfare. Â¦
At 2:20 p.-m. Halo asked for a vote upon
the pending; proposition, but Butler, ad
dressed the senate in opposition to- the
surrender by the Senate when it was on
the verge of victory.
In conclusion. Butler exclaimed: "Let
the loot begin." ' .
A ' vote was then taken on Penrose's
proposition and it was agreed toâ 39 to 35,
as follows:
Ayes â Allison, Baker, Carter,' Clark, Cullom.
Davis. Deboe, Depew, Elklns. Fairbanks, Fos

livan, Taliaferro. Teller,- Tillman, Turner. Vest
-35.
A further conference was then ordered.
Allison presented a conference report on
the sundry civil bill, the House having
disagreed to the single item remaining to
be adjustedâ the provision to pay the
claim of the State of Nevada. Allison
said that with much regret he would
move to recede from the amendment.
After Stewart had made a statement con
cerning the claim, the motion of Allison
was agreed to, thus completing the bill.
The Senate then, at 3:35 p. m., went into
executive session, resuming legislative
business at 3:45 o'clock.-
Pettigrew called up his resolution to dis
charge the Committee on Education and
Labor from further consideration of a bill
limiting the daily hours of labor, common
ly known as the eight-hour bill.
Hawley moved to lay the resolution on
the table, which motion prevailedâ 33 to

The House bill extending the coal lands
laws to the District of Alaska was passed
in the midst of considerable confusion.
Senators were pressing for recognition,
when Hale protested against the transac
tion of business in such confusion. He
had not heard what the bill was that just
had 1 been passed. So it was, he said, with
some heat, that an amendment had been
put on the military academy appropria
tfon bill providing for Senatorial cadets.
He was opposed to these cadets and the
proposition had been voted down by the
Senate. He declared that such action on
the part of a conference committee was
an outrage. He had consulted with Mr.
Sewell, chairman of the Senate Confer
ence Committee, and had been assured
that the amendment would not be put in
tho bill.
In explanation of the action of the con
ferees, Sewell 'Said the House conferees
had insisted upon this ' increase, in the
corps of cadets at the military academy,
and the conferees of the Senate, knowing
that a similar provision had been in an
other bill, he felt justified In yielding to
the House proposition.
A bill amending the statute relative to
the appointment of receivers was passed.
A recess was taken from 4:40 to 6:30
p. m.
The Senate reconvened at 6:30 o'clock,
and after being in session fifty-five min
utes without accomplishing anything, took
a recess until 8:25.
When the Senate reconvened at 8:25
Hale announced that the conferees on the
naval appropriation bill had agreed to a
final report and it probably, in a brief
time, would be sent to tho Senate from
the House.
Allison, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, presented In tabulated form
a statement of appropriations made dur
ing the session. Allison said the princi
pal Increases were in the appropriations
made for the navy and army and the
PostofTlce Department and in items of the
civil bill.
When the suggestion was made by
Cockrell that an informal recess be taken
until the naval conference report was re
ceived from the House Carter of Mon
tann said the time spent in awaiting the
report, "might be employed profitably by
the anti-expansionists in submitting their
views on the Oregon election." He di
rected attention to the fact that Rep
resentative Tongue, who four years ago
was elected by only sixty-five majority,
had been re-elected this week by a ma
jority of more than 3000..
"Oregon," said he, "gives a Republican
majority of 10,000, and this man Tongue,
who has consistently supported the pres
ent administration, Porto Rlcan tariff and
all, has a known majority of more than
3000 and the back counties yet are to be
heard from. It seems to me that the time
might be spent well In hearing the ex
planations of the anti-expansionists . for
this condition of affairs in Oregon."
"If the Senator .from Montana," sug
gested Cockrell, "will introduce a resolu
tion declaring the Senate a political de
bating society we will enter upon its con
sideration." Â¦ Â¦
"I have sometimes thought," said Car
ter,'"that the legitimate functions of this
body have been perverted. It has become
a forum. Not only that, but it has be
come a place from which the most vile
and venemous political fulminations arc
hurled at men in public life."
Carter said much of the abuse suffered
by Washington and Lincoln and Grant
had been very like the abuse heaped by
innuendo and insinuation upon the pres
ent President. Washington. Lincoln ad
Grant had beeti assailed and re-elected.
He predicted victory for McKinley thl3
fall. The first gun of the campaign has
been fired in Oregon, which has given a
Republican majority of 10.000 in favor of
the Porto Rican tariff, and despite the
erring wandering way of a man said to
be a criminal in Cuba.
Carter then entered-upon a general dis
cussion of the Philippine situation from
a political viewpoint.
Mason of Illinois made a half humorous,
half serious reply to Carter. He declared
that i the ; Republican party had carried
Oregon in,spiteÂ«of and not because of our
Philippine policy, our policy toward the
Porto Rlcans and our treatment of the
Boers : in I South | Africa. He /Jevoted spe
cial attention to what he termed the neg
lect c of the South African republics by
"the mother of republics." . : . ,â¢
Turner said .' he had . not got into the
chamber in time to hear all of the "stump
speech'! of Carter, but he had arrived in
time to hear him place Mr. McKinley
firmly in the White House as the result
of the next campaign. This reminded
him .that Carter .had undertaken to elect
a President .eight years ago and. not
withstanding the enormous campaign
DAY OF STRIFE
IN THE SENATE
WASHINGTON. Z ;ne 6.â When
the House to-night at 10:30 took
a recess until 10 a. m. to-mor
row the two chambers of the
national legislature, witli heads
flown anil horns Jock'-d, were in a desper
ate struggle over the item In the navai
appropriation bill relating to ocean sur
veys. The final adjournment of Congress
is postpont-d until it is over. The pro
ceedings in the House during the day
were tame and without dramatic incident.
This was partly due to the fact that the
lirm position taken by the House on tbo
armor plate provision transferred the
fight to the floor of the Senate and to
the obstinate refusal of Lentz. an Ohio
Democrat, to permit any unanimous con
sent lt-gi^!ation until the Republican leail
ers agreed to allow the testimony in the
Coeur d'Alese investigation to be printed.
Lentz held the House by the throat all
cay and except for privileged matters
things ir-irisiative were practically at u
eiandstili.
Bui to-night there was enough r-xeite
tr.er.t to compensate for the dullness of
the day session. The House get its dander
up over the failure of its conferees to
abide by their instructions on the ocean
turvcy item and after an exceedingly
sensational uc-bate in which Cannon, the
chairman ot the Appropriations Commit
tee, made some Startling disclosure* as
to the ma!UiÂ«T in which Commander Todd.
the hydrographer cf the navy, had wageti
his campaign against the stand taken by
the House in favor of the Coast and Geo
detic Survey doing ocean survey wcrk.
the House rejected the conference report
by an overwhelming majority and the
Speaker took the almost unprecedented
COVM of appointing now conferees on
the part of the House who are not mem
bers of the Navai Committee.
The debate was one of the bitterest and
most heated of the session. Cannon in
ihe excitement of <he moment took oif
his collar and necktie And. with fleev:?
rolled up, aroused the House to a trf
mencious pitch of enthusiasm as he dealt
the conferees sledgehammer blows. Tht
galleries, crowded to the doors, cheered
the picturesque tipht of the grizzled old
veterans until the fretted ceiling rang.
The conferees defended their course as
beti they could, and "Foe?, acting chair
man of the committee, resented v.ith bit
ter language the charge tha.t he had be
trayed the House.
Hot words were bandied back and forth,
but the House was in an ugly mood land
was resolved to light the i^tnate to a
finish. The appointment as conferees ct
Cannon. Moody and Shafroth, all oi
whom are in sympathy with the House's
position, assures no surrender on their
part until the House Itself shall direct
them to yield.
A handful of members were on hand
when the House reassembled. Speaker
Henderson went home abÂ«ut 4 a. m., and
was again the chair at S, showing no signs
of fatigue.
The conference report on the general de- ]
ficiency bill, showing a complete agree- .
ment. was presented and agreed to. As ,
the attendance was slim a recess was
taken until : j ::Â» o'clock. Additional mem- i
bers had come in when the Housie reas
sembled. The joint resolution expressing i
gratification over the unveiling of the La
layette statue at Paris was agreed to.
Cannon then submitted the conference
rÂ» port Â«>n the sundry civil bill, showing
the item covering the claims of Nevada to
be the only one in dispute. Among the im
portant itenis struck out were those for
the memorial bridge across the Potomac
River and a lighthouse vessel for the Pa
ciric Coast, for a branch soldiers' home
in Idaho, legation buildings in Korea and
ifiar: and a statue of Rochambeau.
Among the important items retained
were th">Â«e placing under the supervision
of the Secretary of the Treasury the exe
cution of the Chinese exclusion and immi
gration laws; gauging the water supply of
certain streams, {l'X'.OiXi: providing plans
for the enlargement of the White House
and -the development of surrounding
grounds: appropriating C3.Q00 for the
South Pass of the Mississippi River: pro
viding for the settlement ot Spanish war
claims arising from military use ar.d oc
cupation.
The Mississippi. Missouri and Columbia
River items wtre retained, tile Mississippi
item, for the lower river, being reduced n,
S2.250.fÂ«0. The provision as to rttate claims
was compromised by an amendment that
certain Federal claims against these
States would not be prosecuted. Th2
forest reserve provision was amended so
that lieu land settlements shall hereafter
be made from surveyed lar.ds.
Cannon explained that the Senate had
added about $5.oc).000 to the original 56i.
000,000 of this bill, and that, by this re
port, the Senate yielded about Sl.O'iO/nO
and the House $4,000,000. Considerable de
bate followed on the various items.
The sundry civil conference report' wa?
agreed to. and on the one item still open,
jippropriatiiigJ4C2.<K | 0for claims of Nevada,
ii was moved that the House concur with
the Senate amendment. This brought on
a sharp debate on State claims. Moody
of Massachusetts urging that payment of
the Nevada claim would set a precedent
for otier like claims, aggregating about
55.O00/KW, and would establish a dangerous
precedent. The claim was for extra pay
given to Nevada's soldiers during tho
Civil 'War. California, if this claim were
paid would have a valid claim for $4,O<>3,
uOO and Oregon for nearly half a million.
Nowlands' motion to concur in the Sen
ate amendment was lost by 43 to ST. The
House further insisted on the amend-'
mont and the bill was sent back to con
ference.
The House passed a few bills of minor
importance during the afternoon by unan
imous consent. A number of requests for
unantraotjs consent were preferred, but
Lentz of Ohio objected on the ground
that Â¦ his personal rights were being tn
vaded by the refusal of the majority to
allow the printing of the Coeur d'Alcne
testimony. The House spent most. of the
time In recess.
As the dav wore on there were some
amusing incidents. Greene of Massachu
setts asked unanimous consent to con-
Flder a bill to establish a "lobster hatch
cry" In Maine. The mention of the ob
ject of the bill created much merriment.
"Until we have the Coeur d'Alene testi
mony printed," observed Lentz of Ohio.
"we -will have to deprive ourselves of
lobsters. 1 object."
After a brief recess a hundred or more
members with private bills were hustling
for recognition, but I.rntz of Ohio had
declared that he would object to unani
mous consent for anvthing until an order
was made to permit the printing of the
Coeur d'Alene testimony. All mem)Â«crs
were referred to him, but none could per
suade him to yield. He took the position
that his personal rights were being in
vaded by the refusal of the majority to
allow the printing of this testimony. Fig
urativelv ho had the House by the throat.
Lents finally withdrew his objection
against several bills of minor importance,
including a Senate bill to preserve the
rights of Women who might marry after
taking up homesteads under the home
stead law.
The resignation of McPherson of Iowa,
who has been appointed United States
District Judge, was laid before the House.
Dollivcr of Iowa asked unanimous con
sent to consider a bill to incorporate the
Supremo Lodge of the Kuights of- Pythias.
â¢inasmuch as I am a member of the
order." said Lentz. "and inasmuch as it
has lodges in the C'oeur d'Alene district, I
will not object*' (Laughter.)
The bill was passed.
At 4 o'clock Foss called the attention
of the House to the fact that the Senate,
after a protracted struggle, had practi
cally agreed to the House provision rela
tive' to armor p!r>.ti>. The only change
was a change of verbiage, making it man
datory upon thr- Secretary of the Navy to
erect an iirmcr i>late factory in case he
cannot contract for armor plate at a
reasonable and equitable price.
Kitchen of North Carolina assailed the
proposition to give the Secretary of the
Navy cart blanche to pay what price he
pleased for armor plate, but a motion by
Fops to concur in the Senate amendment
prevailedâ K.4 to 96.
The bill wns then .sent back to confer
ence. The House took a recess untii
8 p. m.
When the House reconvened at 6 o'clock
Cannon, chairman of the Appropriations
CommituÂ« j , attempted to make a state
ment relative to appropriations for this
Congress, but Lentz interposed an objec
tion. He was as obdurate as he had been
all day. rctusing his consent unless the
Coeur d'Alcne testimony was ordered
printed.
Cannon frankly staled that his pur
pose was to make the usual statement for
the benefit of the country and the House.
If the objection was insisted upon he
wouid print it in the Record. Despite the
appeals of some of his Democratic asso
ciates I-entz refused to relent and Cannon
desisted.
A resolution to print 10,000 copies cf the
rrport of the Committee on Agriculture
in the Grout bill was put through over
Lentz's head amid much merriment. The
Speaker completely ignored Lentz.
At 8:30 p. m. Fops presented the final re
port of the naval appropriation bill. A
compromise had been effected on the pro
vision relative to ocean surveys, which
appropriated $50,000 for hydrographic sur
veys, -while the House repeded from its
provision abolishing the two years' sea
course for naval cadets, but secured an
amendment to the present law to permit
an appointment from each Congressional
cistrict every four years. Koss said the
Senate conferees had absolutely insisted
upon the provision relative to ocean sur
veys.
Cannon, who had led the fight against
ocean surveys under tho direction of the
Navy Department, was not satisfied with
the agreement reached by the conferees.
He declared it was reached in the teeth of
the specific instructions of the House.
Cannon then related how subsequently
Spcr^tary Long had ascertain***? that the
hydroprapher. Commander Todd, had sent
out a circular letter without his (Long's)
Unowlfdge and for that act he had been
suspended. Â¦
Burton of Ohio indignantly repudiated
the charge in Commander Todd's circu
lar that he and others were in a secret
combine against the Navy Department
in this controversy. . .
Dayton of West Virginia, one of the
naval conferees, in wildly excited tones
denounced as "false and untrue" the
statement that the conferees had betrayed
their trust.
Foss also denounced in harsh words the
statements that the conferees had not
stood by the House's instructions.
Fops then moved to concur in the re
port and demanded the previous ques
tion. He declined to further serve on the
conference committee. -
Cannon appealed for ten minutes, but
the House howled him down. He then
cried: "Vote down the previous question,"
as the Speaker put the question.
..The. previous question was voted down,

VjiThe "Red FrvtrfcmJ
A.J. PR'AGER a SONS if"^THE quarantine situation is coming
to a crisis. With the Board of
Health determined, to remove be
tween seven and I eight thousand
Chinese to detention camps and the Chin
ese determined to resist by force If neces
sary; with the State Board of Health tied
up by the Governor, who refuses to allow
a dollar of State money to be paid out
for quarantine purposes until It has Incn
demonstrated to him that the plague ac
tually exists; with the merchants seeking
a consultation with the attorneys for the
Chinese In the various suits tiled for the
purpose. It Is reported, of securing a eom
1 promise in regard to the quarantine, and
with the Federal quarantine official only
waiting until the quarantine of China
town has been broken to step in and
quarantine the city, there Is food for any
kind of a sensation.
The stand of the Governor was taken
before the State Bonrd of Health at Us
meeting last evening. For nearly two
hours the board held nn executive session
and during most of that time there was
bitter controversy. The Governor up
braided the members of the State bonrd
for maintaining an attitude which he saiil
amounted to an Indorsement of the policy
of the local board. He said he had not
had the slightest evidence that there was
nny of the plague In Chinatown, and un
til It was clearly shown to him that the
plague actually existed he would not al
low a dollar of the State's money to bÂ«
spent In quarantine.
Say the Governor Is Prejudiced.
Dr. Bazet and Dr. Anderson replied that
tho Governor was prejudiced and un
scipntiftc, and added that If he were of a
scientilic turn of mind he might undcr
: stand these things, to which the Gover
nor replied that what he lacked in science
he made up In common sense and anyway
the existence of the plague would have to
be demonstrated to him btfore he would
allow any State aid. Without State aid
the local board cannot hope to do much
along their present lino of endeavor.
This morning the merchants will meet
the attorneys for the Chinese in formal
consultation. What tho subject matter
of the conference would be is not deflnlt-*
ly.known, but It has been reported to the
attorneys for the Chinese by one who
was at the meeting of the merchants yes
terday afternoon, that the proposition
was to reach some agreement by which
the quarantine of Chinatown could be
raised, or at loase be maintained only
on houses supposed to be Infected. It
was jit first reported In Chinatown that
tho Board of Health was seeking the com
promise and that tbe offer wa* that If
the present suits would he withdrawn the
quarantine would be raised within a few
days â In the shortest time in which Ii
could be done and still not overturn tho
dignity of the board. The attorneys- for
the Chinese claim there Is no wny by
which a compromise of any kind can bÂ«
reachedâ that Is. short of an actual and
immediate withdrawal of -the. quarantine,
and so there Is not much looked for from
the meeting. It Is further suspected th-n
while the offer comes from the merchants
still the board Itself Is not averse to hav
ing the matter carried' through and that
It is with the full . knowledge of the board
that this is being done.
Federal Quarantine Probable.
And then behind it all is the Federal
quarantine service, one not to be desp!sr<l
and one not showing its reaj strength or
purpose in the tangle of law and bacilli.
From the solicitude of the Government at
Washington over the number of Chinese
that are distributing themselves all over
the Union it Is evident that if the. quar
antine of" Chinatown be raised' the Fed
eral Government is very liable to close
the port ami the city. In fact, steps are
notvv being taken to have inspectors on
outbound ftenmers and on outbound
trains, but until the courts have decided
whether or not the quarantine may bo
maintained the Government cannot act:
The authorities at Washington are much
worried over the probable outcome of the
suit to come before the United States Cir
cult Court to-day and they are eagerly
watching for the result. They are con
tinually inquiring, too. as to the elHcacy
of the quarantine and ns to the number
of Chinese r.ho are leaving the city And
State. Over a thousand havo left the city
since tho quarantine and moro nve
streaming- after thi^m this morning. If the
quarantine b* rals-?d the Chinese, anxious
to avoid a repetition of the dose of de
tention, will scatter themselves board
cast, and this the Federal authorities will"
endeavor to prevent.
May Take Full Charge.
Already the lnws of ISM are being re
ferred to. and these mean only that the
Federal service may take hold Just about
when it pleases. It Is provided that when
In the opinion of the Government local
health authorities are unable to maintain
a nccessary % quarantine or take all needful
precautions the Federal- service may step
In and take charge. This is what was
done when the control of the quarantine
of this port passed from the hands of tho
State to those of the Federal Government,
and this Is what Is meant by references
to the laws of 1SD0.
At the meeting of the City Board of
Hcnlth-yrsterdny afternoon there was
practically nothing done. The board Is
v.-altlnp for the outct/ne of this morning's
pult. It was decided to n"<M v the case for.
the board to rest In the hands of the Dis
trict Attorney and the attorney for the
board. J. J. Dunne.
No regulations or preparations for the
removal of the indigent Chinese have
been framed. Thin has born left to the
citizens' committee. The Chinese will
probably be thoroughly fumigated and
then marched through the streets to the
boats. Tlicro fcems to have been no other
way thought of.
Governor Seeks Information.
Tlie conference between the Governor
nncl the members of the Stato B#Sard was
held In a private room of the Palace Hotel
and was executive. Drs. Hill. Crowley,
Bazet, Ruggles and Henderson of tlio
State Board of Health were present; also
ox-Governor Budd. representing the Six
Companies, and Dr. Ryfkogel, bacteriolo
gist of the Oakland Board of Health. The
posslon was a ftormy one. At the outset
the Governor stated to the board that he
souprht. for information. He had IVern re
quested by the National Secretary of
State, he said, for nn official state
ment of the exact conditions existing
In Snn Francisco In relation 'to the. plague
and had been trvins hnrd for several day*
to secure information npnn which he could
na.Â«e a fair Â«nil unpreh'iillced report. Thus
far he hnd been unable to secure nny re
liable information as to the existence oi
the plaerue in San Francisco, and hnd
about -come to Â¦ the conclusion that the
disease did, not exist here now or nt
any tlmo. He hnd formed the onlnion,
however, that the State Bonrd of Honlth
had acted. hnstlly and without warrant In
supnortinpr the local bonrd without having
rnnile an independent examination Into the
existing conditions. -For -his part tno
Governor would not sanction tho expendi
ture of State funds until ho hnd secured
the evidence thnt would warrant it.
Doctors Get Sxcited.
Drs. and Henderson boenme
greatly excited ovpr the position taken by
the Governor, accusing him of prejudice.
ThÂ«Â»y said that he had boen prejudiced
Bfcalnst" the local board before h* onme
to them. They said he was not a scien
tific man and could not understand the
conditions upon which they hnd formed
their opinion and. finally, that If he could
understand, the scientific facts his preju
dice, would not permit him to grasp them.
The Governor held his ground, giving
the two doctors n. calling dov.n that they
will not' soon forget, and reiterating his
position. After the conference Governor
QaKC retired.' find Dr. Hill called the State
Bonr3xto order in. regular session. United
Stairs Quarantine Officer Klnyoun. City
Bacteriologist Kellogg. City Health Ofll
cer O'Brien and a number of other physi
cians were : present, and the members" of
the press were admitted. - .''., Â¦
' Then came, a clash between Dr. Hen
derson and ex-Governor Budd over an at
tempt''of the acting secretary of the
board to override the Governor by send
ing out to the Boards of Health of ah
the States a report on the plague condi
tions, founded, apparently, upon the find
ings of the local board.
t>r. Crowley 'offered a resolution that
the State board make an official report
to tho health authorities of every county
in the State of the conditions existing
here and *at the same time notify them
of tho number of Asiatics who have leit
this city for various points in the State
since May I. â¢
Dr. Henderson moved to amend by ex
tending the Information "Jo the boards of
health of every State in the Union, on the
ground that the California board Is a
member of the National Association of
Health Boards and had voted for a rule
which required every member of the as
sociation to keep all of the other mem
bers thoroughly informed of the appear
ance and progress of contageous diseases
In Its territory. The California board was
bound, morally and professionally, .to live
up to this rule and must keep faith at thiÂ«
time.
Dr. Crowley protested mildly against
the amendment, advising that the board
wait a few days for policy's sake. The
plague cases that have come under -ob
servation, he said, were confined to four
square blocks and as there had only been
two cases reported since May 15 there
seemed to be no cause to spread general
alarm.
Budd on the Warpath.
Ex-Governor Budd asked permission to
speak and the request having been
granted pounced upon Henderson in hur
ricane fashion.
"You are State officers, he said, "and
ns su*h it is your plain duty, under the
lnws of this State, to report first to the
Governor, who alone has the authority to
communicate officially with the heads of
other States or with the national Gov
ernment. â¢ He has asked you to-night to
furnish him with the information ' that
will enable him to make an Intelligent
report to the Secretary of State, who has
asked, through him. for information. Are
you golnc now to Ignore your chief exec
utive? Before your . letters havo well
started on their wny he will have pent
forth the official Information by wire and
scattered It all over the world." â¢
Henderson replied thnt the local board
had already written letters to the boards

â¢ Information was reeetx-ed yesterday
from San Jose announcing the death at

of this city.
Mrs. Kopp gained considerable notoriety
hero about a year ago by shooting her
husband, Charles Kopp, a retired restau

The intruder was driven from the house
and Mrs. Kopp charged her husband with
the perfidy of which she had unmistak
able proofs. The husband only laughed
and said that he had learned to love Mrs.
Monti and did not intend to give her up.
Mrs. Kopp pleaded that as she had but
a short time to live her husband
should remember his marriage vows and
forset the usurper of her home. Plead
ings had no effect on Kopp. however, and
the climax came when the sSck wife and

Mri/WAT'TvEE. WI*.. June 8.-Re
orgar.Ization, the issue of the day
in the General Federation of
Women's Clubs, will not come to
a vote until to-morrow. It was
di?rt7Â«f=e<S both at the morning and af
ternoon sessions to-day, the drift of the
arfrurr.er.t bolr.g in favor, of the majority
report of the committee on reorganization,
â¢which report stands for but little change
in the present form of organization.
Three opposed to reorganization, which
mÂ«ans the continued recognition of the
individual club Instead of a national fed
eration, made up of State federations
or.1v. !r.clud<vl Mrs. Baker of Colorado.
Mrs. Julia B. Shattuck of Illinois and
Mrs. William Ted Helmuth of New York.
Those favoring reorganization included
Mrs. D. J. Jones of Colorado and Mrs.
fruiter cf L'tah.
The chances are the color Question will
not be pushed to a public controversy
unless Mrs. Josephine Ruffin, the colored
delegate, chooses to do so Individually.
Th<? Massachusetts delegation said to
r.lght it had sent its protest to the board
cf directors and would abide by Its de
cision and at such time as It would choose
to make It. In the meantime, no less
than eight State delegations have sent
similar protests to the board.
The Southern women, on the other hand,

impossible the sending of another colored

They furthermore said that no matter
If the board should decide to take action
during the convention they would not
leavo it, at least not during this biennial.
This liberal stand Is evidently meant In
support of Mrs. Lowe, who, as the.con
tinued president, with the color question
as an i.Â«sue before the federation, would
certainly be the best connecting link be
tween the North and the South.
The announcement that the ticket would
bÂ« made up with Mrs. Ixiwe as president
and Mrs. Charles Denison of New York as
vice president was somewhat of a sur
prise after Mrs. Lowe's repeated refusals,
but It, nevertheless eeems to please the
greater part of the delegates and there is
little doubt that at least the head of the
ticket will go through with little oppo
sition.
As for representation on the board It is
likely California will get something and
Illinois is also discussing a candidate for
that position. r
Following the business session in the
afternoon came a drive along the lake

had Instructed the quarantine officer of
that port to have all ballast from Infected
ports submerged In water, and the Board
of Harbor Commissioners had refused to
allow the material to be dumped Into
Humboldt Bay. as It would fill the chan
nel and Impede navigation. As foreign
shipping has also to be accommodated,
the board had decided to construct a bulk
head of piles behind which to dump the
ballast.
The question was which treasury the
expense should come out of. city or coun
ty? Deputy Attorney General William M.
Abbott has prepared an opinion which Is
to the effect that the money should be
paid out of the county treasury. Under
a decision of the Supreme Court, this ln'a
case where the county Is benefited as well
as the city, for ballast from an Infected
port. If It carries the perms of disease,
would be dangerous to the entire section
as well as the municipality.

party of thirteen left" Plymouth, this
county, yesterday, afternoon- for a point
three miles below Michigan Bar on the
Cosumnc River.' Reaching there, two of
trie party, Charles Phillips of Sacramento
and Miss Jennie Vanderpool, a school
teacher at Spring Valley, near Plymouth,
began wading In the river along the bank
and ietepped into a deep hole and their
companions tried In vain to save them.
The river -was running swiftly between
hlprh walls and the two were quickly lost
slKht of. This was at 7 o'clock, and al
though many people were searching Phil
lips' body was found at lÂ» o'clock this
morning and Miss Yanderpool's a few
hours later. was 21 years of age
lie- was visiting two murried brothers and
a sister at Plymouth. Miss Vanderpool
was 24 years of age.
SACRAMENTO. June G.-Both Charles
Phillips and M'ss Jennie Vanderpoal. the
victims of the'Cosumnp River tragedy,
were well known in Haoramciito. JJp to
within a week of his death Phillips had
been in the employment of the firm ni
Ins & Allee, druggists, and it was his in
tention to resume his pti'dies in phar
macy at the State University in a short
time. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs.
S. H. Phillips of 1SOÂ» Fourteenth street,
this rity. with whom he made his home.
Miss .Vanderpool is a graduate of a lo
cal business college and up to a few
months ago was a stenographer in the
office of Hale Bros, in this city. She re
turned to her old home at Plymouth to
take a poHltlon as a schoolteacher.
Both victims of the drowning had many
friends in this city who spoke of them
in the highest terms. Phillips was an un
usually (iuiet and studious young man
and he gave promis.? of becoming ver>
proficient in his chosen field.

THE Republican County Committee
mot last night- In an effort to
adopt a plan for district club or
ganization In the present cam
paign. Two schemes were present
ed, and after a heated and frequently
acrimonious debate, lasting for nearly
four hours, both plans were submitted to
a Joint committee, consisting of the ad
visory and executive committees, which
was given full and final power to act.
This Joint committee had already held
several sessions and had adopted a plan.
Before it was presented Chairman Al
Bouvier urged the members of the Coun
ty Committee to give It serious attention,
as 5t would dictate the policy of the party
on a vitally important matter If adopted,
and the entire committee in its duty to
the party and to the public is called upon
to be above the suspicion of intrigue or
faction. ; â¢; V:v Â¦
One Way to Organize Clubs.
The plan submitted by the joint com-
mitlee provides for the organization of a
club In each Assembly district, under the
auspices of a majority of the county
committeemen representing each district.
The plan is as follows:
Pl^AN FOR THE ORGANIZATION' OP THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY IX THE VARIOUS
ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS OP THE CITY
AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
Article 1. There shall be formed under the
auspices of the Republican County Committee
Jn each Awembly district a club, to be styled
the "Recular Assembly District Re
publican Club," which shall be the official
Republican organization of said district, and of
and to which all Republicans in good standing
In the party and actually raiding in said
district shall be eligible for membership.
Article 2. District official clubs shall be or
ganized In the manner following: A majority
of the County Comraltteemen of each district,
end fix or more reputable Republicans selected
by them. ehaJl constitute an organizing and
canvassing committee for such district, with
full power to organize such official club. Raid
committee Ehall give notice. In euch manner as
may b* determined, that they will proceed to
enroll the Republicans of the' district. "Every
person desiring to be .enrolled shall be re
quired to Elrn bis name and give his address
and votlnz precinct in the district.
There shall also be an ."enrolling and advis
ory committee" of three for each precinct
including in said committee of three the mem
ber " of the executive committee for the re
spective precinct. â¢ Â¦ . . . : . .
--It -nhall; among other things, be ' the duty
of said "enrolling and advisory committees"
to . canvass . their respective precincts, and to
enroll from their said precincts as many mem
bers of the Republican party as may be pos
sible.
Every member of such club shall in person
s!*n the roll of membership of said club.
This committee will furnish printed roll
books, one for each precinct.
Only such rollbooks shall be recognized.
The rreclnct v rollbooks must be handed to
the respective presidents of the clubs on or be
fore. July 2, 1900, ."and a. duplicate thereof in
one volume, for each district.; shall thereupon
be made and retained by the secretary of the
clul>. -The original precinct rollbooks shall be'
filed on or before July 9, 1300, wltnthe secre
tary of this County Committee, who shall cer-
The officers of each club shall be a president
two vice presidents, a secretary and a treas
urer, elected by the members of such club
and an executive committee consisting of one
member for each precinct in the district to
be appointed by the president thereof.
The nepublican party of San Francisco shall
be organized in eighteen regular and official
Assembly District Republican clubs, one in
each Assembly District.
Each club must have at least three members
from each and every precinct In the district
Every member of the Republican party, and
any elector who agrees to support the Repub
lican ticket at the nÂ«xt ensuing election, shall
bo eligible for .membership in the club of the
Assembly District in which he actually re-
He declared that the County Committee
represents simply a faction, and If the
plan submitted was adopted Republicans
would see that even in a Presidential year
the local organization intends to carry its
bitterness of factions .into the campaign.
His scheme he urged would prevent all of
this by giving to a committee of the
County Committee the power to supervise
all organization of clubs, to harmonize
factions in the districts and give to each
fair play. More than this, Â¦ he said his
scheme would make the district clubs
thoroughly representative; would organize
them into one centralized whole In which
the County Committee would be the rec
ognized head. With these recommenda
tions he submitted the following plan:
factionalism to extremes, to shut out
some Republicans and favor others.

were safe on the outside that they learned
of the great danger through which they
had just passed.
Xo time was lost by the scholars when
the alarm was eounded. At the first tap
of the bell they were on their feet and
within two minutes were beyond danger.
There were two exits to the building. The
classes on the upper floor passed out
through one of these and those on the
ground flood made their escape through
the other. The fire originated near a
stairway leading to the upper floor. Had
it broken through at this' point instead of
of about a block Chrlstianson captured
the man who had received the purse and
returned it to its owner. He was taken
â¢before Captain Seymour, but as there was
no evidence agrainst him he was liberated.
He gave the name of George Walker and
said he was a barber.
The fire drill was introduced but a few
Tnonths ago at the school, and since its
Inauguration the children had been drilled
about twice in each week. The children
In each case were taken by surprise and
Â¦when they least expected it the alarm of
danger sounded. The frequency with
v.hlch this has been repeated is responsi
ble to a great degree for their prompt
response when the fire started yesterday.
They regarded the signal yesterday as a
false alarm, and without the slightest
fear passed out It v.-as only after all
The lady principal did not lose her pres
ence cf mind. In an instant she thought
of the hundreds of young lives in her
charge and acted with great coolness and
dlspatel) to effect their rescue. Without
betraying her loars Miss Casey sounded
the alarm calling for a fire drill. In ex
actly one minute and three-quarters after
she had given the signal the children had
fiied out in perfect order and stood apart
from the burning structure.
Principal's Prompt Action.
The f;re started on the Â¦west side of the

first Inkling given that the building was

the principal of the school, detected the

A f.re drill. practicaJ and we'l rr.JLstered,
raved this mass of juvenile humanity from
what might otherwise have developed in
to a direful catastrophe. Guided by its
perfect workings, the little scholars
marched from the blaring structure to a

danger pressing so close around them.

as it was. The room near which the paint
ers were working was occupied by the
class in charpc of Miss Mary A. Jacobs.
This teacher discovered the fire just as
the principal sounded the alarm. Miss
Casey's office was on the same side of the
structure.
Once th<? children were outside they
stood amund. hatless, and watched the
flames shoot through the roof. They
thought of their books, but they were not
allowed to return after any property. An
alarm was turned in from the box at the
corner of Dupont and Green streets and
the department was quick in responding.

The building is situated on the western
slope of Telegraph Hill, near the summit.
It made a spectacular fire aa the element
of destruction quickly enveloped it. As In
the case cf the conflagration at 1402 Mont
gomery street last Saturday night, the
firemen experienced much difficulty in
pulling the apparatus to the scene, and
some time was lost before a stream of
water could be thrown on the fire. The
children and their teachers ctood in
groups on the bluffs above, watching the
names destroy their home. Â»The roof was
completely destroyed and the entire struc
ture gutted. The school building was an
old one, having stood for over thirty
years, and the dry lumber burned like tin
der. The building was valued at $10,000.
To this must be added the loss sustained
bv the destruction of the children's prop

their records and personal effects. There
were nine classes in the school, eight of

times be open to the inspection of any member
of this committee.
The organization of the said eighteen clubs
shall be under the full charge and supervision
of a committee of five, consisting of the chair
man and secretary of this County Committee,
the chairman of the executive committee there
of, the chairman of the advisory committee
thereof and one additional member to be elected
by tfce County Committee.
The paid committee of five shall select and
appoint one member of this County Committee
representing each of the various Assembly dis
tricts in this committee to preside over and
take charge of the temporary organization of
the respÂ«*cti\-e clubs In their respective dis
tricts, the appointments to be announced within
one hour after the adoption of this resolution
and respectively to stand unless protest shall
be made by a majority of the members of the
respective district delegations to this County
Committoe within twenty-four hours after such
announcement, in which event, after hearing
sueh protest, the said committee of five shall,
if in any case good reason be shown, appoint
some other member of the district delegation,
or. In their discretion. If no good reason be
shown to the contrary, maintain the original
appointment.
In caÂ«e any such protest shall have been
made, the full committee of five shall attend
at the organization of the club. In the district
from which such protest shall have come,
and shall supervise the organization thereof,
with & view tu harmony and Justice.
In all easrs the said committee of five!, or
a EUb-ccmmUtco thereof, shnll attend at the
preliminary organization of each club. Said
clubs shall be organized during the week, com
mencing June 11 and ending June 17, 1903. at
such dates, times and places as said commit
tee of five shall, by printed circular, announce
to the members of the County Committee and
through the press to Republicans generally,
on or before Saturday, June 9. 1300.
If deemed advisable by the ccunty commlttse
men of any district and by f\[A committee of
five, permanent organization may be effected
or. the date of preliminary organization, other
wise may be postponed to a subsequent date
not later than July 2, l."C0.
In the discretion of the said committee of
five, should, at any time, after such organiza
tion, the territory of any Assembly district
be deemed to be so extended as to Justify the
establishment of another club, upon proper
demand by the representatives of this com
mittee from such district, such additional club
may b? organized in the same manner and
under the same supervision as is herein pro
vided.
"Without dictating or Imposing It as a neces
sary condition, this committee recommends to
each club that, other things being equal, it se
lect as Its president, where practicable and
otherwise eatlsfactory. a member of this com
mittee, to the end that each club shall b? con
staontly in touch with the Central Committee,
both being reciprocally officially advised of
the affairs of the party, its organization. Its
condition and its plans, by such club president.
It Is recommended that as soon as practicable
permanent headquarters be established by
each club In Its respective Assembly district.
Should complaint be made after June 17, 1W0.
of any fraudulent or false enrollment In any
of said clubs, sa'.d committee of five shall hear
said comDlalnt, and after such hearing may.
In Its discretion, strike from the roll any names
satisfactorily proven to It to have been Â¦wrcng
fully enrolled.
An invitation Is hereby extended to all Re
publican organizations contemplating district
organization to Join In this official organize
tloa.
For nearly three hours the committee
discussed those twq plans at one time,
adopting sections of each and finally sub
mitting them both to the joint commit
tee for consideration. This committee
will meet on Saturday nipht -and has
power to adopt a plan without further ref
erence to the general committee. During
the debate A. Truman objected to both
schemes on the ground that they will
perpetuate the power of the bosses, who,
he alleges, control the committee.
Both plans, he said, will lead to the
stuffing of rolls, to misrepresentation and
factional strife in the district. Commit
teeman Curry ventured to agree and was
told by the angry Truman that he too
recently had been thrown out of the Dem
ocratic party to offer suggestions to Re
publicans. This appeared to close the ar
gument and the committee adjourned.

MÂ®wr . fllliSINCE the capture of Pretoria the war in South
Africa, if it continue long, must enter upon a
new phase. The organized national resistance
which has hitherto opposed the British advance will
have to give place to guerrilla warfare. It is true
that in the War of the Revolution the British cap
tured the capital of the Continental Congress at
Philadelphia without thereby crushing the colonies
or their armies, but the military conditions of the
present war are widely different from those that pre
vailed in 1776. Washington had to contend against
no such force as that which has invaded the Transvaal,
neither had he to face a General of anything like the
ability and energy of Roberts. The American pa
triot could after the fall of his capital hold his army
together, but the forces of Kruger must of necessity
scatter or surrender.
What course the Boers will pursue remains to be
seen. They have lost not only their capital, but the
two leaders on whom they most relied for success.
Joubert is dead and Cronje is a prisoner of war in
exile at St. Helena. They have no force strong
enough to resist Roberts' flanking tactics, nor any
General skillful and energetic enough to defeat them
by superior strategy and activity. The war, which
began with brilliant successes for the Afrikanders,
has virtually ended. A great hope has been lost in
that far-off part of the world, arid the long cherished
aspiration for a free Afrikander nation under a repub
lican form of government has perished. A host of
British and foreign adventurers will hasten to the land
where there is such a promise of gold, and in the end
the old Boer element will be swallowed up in the mass
of the new population. An independent South Africa
may be established in another generation, but it will
not be a nation of Dutch people.
At the beginning all -the portents of the time
threatened that the war would be one of the bloodiest
of modern times. The stories of the slaughter of the
British in their early attempts to relieve Ladysmith
went far to confirm the statement attributed to
Kruger that if the British ever conquered the Trans
vaal it would be at a cost that "would stagger hu
manity." The tactics of Roberts, however, changed
the whole outlook, and of late the contest has been
carried on with but a comparatively small loss by the
invading force.
A recent British statement of the total losses of
their armies is to the effect that up to the capture of
Johannesburg 2322 men and officers had been killed
in battle, 571 had died of wounds received in action,
2492 from disease, S4 from accidents, and 49 in cap
tivity, making a total of 558S deaths. In addition the
British forces were weakened by 4330 men missing
and' prisoners, 8901 sent home as invalids and 10,130
wounded, in audition to those who had died of
wounds up to that time.
The whole casualtiesâ killed, died, wounded, miss
ing, prisoners and invalided â makes an aggregate
loss of .28,049. That is not a heavy list for seven
months of war. A writer for the Philadelphia Ledger
in reviewing the battle of Gettysburg stated that the
killed, mortally' wounded and missing on the Union
side alone in that single battle were 23,001, or more
than the total British losses in the Transvaal, if we
exclude the sick sent home as invalids.' War has
THE NEW YORK DODGE.
nILL and Croker, the rival aspirants for the con
trol of the Democratic machine in New York,
have disappointed expectation. It was thought
that between them there would be an open fight in
the State convention for leadership and such honors
as attend the position, but what happened was a com
promise and a division of dishonors.
Hill had declared himself opposed to the Chicago
platform and opposed to sending to the national con
vention a delegation instructed for. Bryan. Croker
had declared for both the Chicago platform and for an
instructed delegation. By the compromise agreed
upon the State convention ignored the Chicago plat
form, but gave the instructions.
The advantage of the situation is with Croker, not
withstanding reports fiom New York declare the con
vention to have been largely under the control of
Hill. The free silver men demanded an express in
dorsement of their financial creed, and the only way
Hill could find to avoid a faction fight then and there
was to declare that by instructing. the delegates to the
national convention to support Bryan a sufficient in
dorsement was given to Bryan's platform. There was
no getting away from the logic of the statement, and
the silver men were content with it. The voters of
the country will take the same view of the situation.
A vote for Bryan will be a vote for free silver coinage
at the ratio of 16 to I.
While making that concession to Tammany and
the silver men Hill has tried to provide for himself
a chance to dodge the charge of supporting now a
policy which he refused, to support in 1896. He was
himself chairman of the committee on â¢ resolutions,
and "the financial plank reported by him declares:
"We favor both gold and silver as the standard
money of the country, the money of the constitution
and of our fathers â each to be maintained at a parity'
with the other in purchasing and debt-paying power â
which has been the steadfast policy of the Democratic
party since the days of Jefferson, who declared that
'the monetary unit must stand on both metals.' "
Doubtless the astute sage of Wolfert's Roost can
explain the vagueness of that pla'nk in many ways to
suit many men of many minds. It may serve some
purpose which he has in/view^ but it is not likely to
deceive any voter of fair intelligence. It. is in vain
that any, party or any faction in this campaign de
clares for the "money of thye constitution" or the
"monetary policy of/ Jefferson." The people are
aware that Bryan stands 'for free silver coinage, for
p. depreciation of the monetary standard, for fifty
cent dollars, and they are also aware that whoever
supports Bryan is a supporter of the Bryan policy
a?- expressed in the Chicago platform. â¢ ,
The explanation of the course taken by the rival
leaders is that both of. them believe Bryan to be
doomed to defeat, but each thinks -'that' Democracy
can achieve local victories. By standing in with the
Bryanitesand holding the party together Crokor be
lieves Tammany can make doubly sure of carrying
the whole of the metropolis of Greater New Yotk.
Ey eliminating the Chicago platform and allots fol
lies Hill believes it possible for Democracy to carry
the State. Thus while Croker is willing to < swallow
the whole Chicago output, platform and candidate,
Hill desired to get rid of both. He was not able to
carry his'plan in ? every respect, but he means to use
his platform for homo purposes and let Bryanism fall
by the wayside. It is one of the kind of dodges for
which Hill is noted, but will in the end prove as
unprofitable as most of the others which he has tried
m the course of his political adventures.
CALIFORNIA'S GOLDEN JUBILEE.
THE Native Sons of the Golden West have laid
the foundation for the proper celebration of the
â¢Golden Jubilee of the admission of the great
State of California into the Union of States. The
iuea of the joint committee of the various parlors is
to make this celebration one thst shall be worthy of
the event, one that will mark the progress of the
Golden State and add in every way to the luster of the
great crown of glory that she wears.
That the Native Sons should take the lead in the
proper recognition of the fiftieth anniversary of the
Statehood of California is meet and proper, for they
2re the descendants of those hardy pioneers who un
denvent the greatest trials in the days before the iron
horse sped across the continent, when the country
west of the Missouri was a trackless. waste, or when
the voyage to the golden shore was in poorly fitted
ont ships around the Horn. In this they are to be
assisted by their fraternal sisters, the Daughters of the
As yet the several committees of the joint commit
tee have only outlined the work that they are to per
form, but from this mere outline it is apparent that it
will be the greatest undertaking that has ever been
known in the celebration line in this city. It will not
be limited to the Native Sons and Daughters of this
city, but all the parlor? of both orders will be invited
to participate in the festivities, which will probably
last for a week. It is to be a gala week; the city is to
be decorated and illuminated as it never was before.
It is proposed that the electrical display shall be
more elaborate than it was on the occasion of the
reception by the Natives of the California Volunteers.
I Communications received from the interior of the
State show that the Native Sons of the country are
hand in hand with their brothers of the city and that
they will contribute largely to the making of a great
success of the Ninth of September and the succeed-
The task tindertnken by those who will manage this
celebration is a stupendous one. It is one, however,
that deserves every support that the, citizens of this
city can extend to it, for it will do a great deal in the
tray o: making the city and the State better known.
To the cily in particular it v.fil attract most undoubt
edly a larger comber of strangers than ever gathered
in it before, not only from the interior, but from ad
joining r.r.d even far more distant sections of the
Union, for those who have charge of the event will
spare neither money nor pains to make it the most
brilliant ever known. Son;c of the local parlors, in
anticipation of the 1900 celebration, commenced three
years ago to lay aside by various methods sums of
rrioney to be used only for the purpose of making a
grand display during the celebration week. This in
itself shows that what will be is r.ot the outburst of
momentary enthusiasm, but that it has been deliber
ated upon for many months. The result of this delib
eration will be the presentation to the general com
nuttee of numerous :dcas of parlors and individuals
fiom which the best will be selected and presented to
the general public in various ways.
Among the features that have already been sug
gested arc a monster parade, electric illumination of
the city and prominent buildings, an electrical arch;
literary exercises appropriate to the grand occasion.
a naval parade, a pyrotechnic display on the bay, ball
r.r.d concert. In a few days the general committee
will announce the scope of the celebration so that all
may have an opportunity to know what l!:c Native
SonCare doing in the line of perpetuating the memo
ries of the days of forty-nine and showing their grati
fication at the majestic strides that California has
made since the days it changed from Territory to
tL2'erxooa.
California has had a most glorious past and she has
a. magnificent future; the Native Sons arc proud of
nl'.at past and they arc striving to make that future ali
that it promises. It is a commendable ambition that
deserves encouragement.'

THE PRUNE-GROWERS' OPPORTUNITY
REPORTS from the managers of the California
Cured Fruit Association are to the effect that
the association has failed to obtain control 'ot
90 per cent of the prune crop of the State as required
by the terms of its original programme of action, and*
consequently some modification of the plan vyill have
to be made. Not only were the conlrTtcts with the
packers dependent upon the association obtaining
that percentage of the prune crop, but many of the
growers' contracts were taken upon a similar under
standing. In order that something may be accom
plished this year a modified plan has been submitted,
and it now depends upon the growers whether it is
to be carried through.
While the association has failed to obtain the full
percentage desired of the" prune crop it has neverthe
less attained a strong position and has now under
contract 90 per cent of the prune acreage of Santa
; Clara County and So per cent of the whole State,
amounting in the aggregate to 53,000 acres. Upon
that basis the managers of the association have asked
the packers to modify their original contracts in the
following particulars: " v .v *
"First â By striking cut the provision guaranteeing
prices when once made by the board, leaving the
same to be changed from time to time in its discre
tion.
"Second â That they waive their demand of 90 per
cent of thecrop and leave the question of percentage
of the crop to be secured to the decision of the man
agement of the association.
"Thirdâ That they agree not to deal with any
broker or jobber who would not limit his dealings in
or sales of prunes to those controlled by the associa
tion.
"Fourth â To do away with the incentive to cut
prices, and to simplify the transaction of their busi
ness with the association, that they agree to organize
into a corporation and deal with the association as one
person."
The packers are reported to have unanimously
given their consent to the modifications, but some of
the growers have been slow in responding to circulars
requesting their agreement. At a meeting of the di
rectors last Monday, ten days after the modification
circulars were sent cut, it was announced that no
answers had been received from about iooo yout of the
3300 members. Upon that showing the board of.di
rectors adopted resolution?, declaring it to be the
judgment of the association that 80 per cent of the
'prune acreage of the State, including 00 per cent of
that of Santa Clara County, would be necessary to
warrant an attempt to assume control of the crops,
and therefore that the time for receiving consent to
the modifications be extended to' June 15; if on that
date the desired percentage shall not have, been ob
tained the association will cease and the responsibility
of failure rest on the grower.
Such is the situation that confronts the prune
growers of the State. This is for them the hour of
opportunity. By prompt action they may establish
a co-operative association that, learning by experience
and growing with the demands put upon it, will be
come eventually an institution of the highest value to
them. If the opportunity be lost there is no telling
when another so favorable! or so promising will be
offered. This is the age of co-operation^ and_the
sooner the fruit-growers of the State learn to practice
that principle the better it will be for them.
Authorize Ecott to Accept
Payment of Disputed,
Taxes.
Action , Will Result in Increasing the
Municipal Stock of Money
and Cut Down the
Dsficit.
The Board ef Supervisors met in special ,
session yesterday afternoon and passed
resolutions. Intended to bring certain
moneys into the city treasury which are
to be applied toward settling a portion of
the prospective municipal deficit. â¢ The
first reaolution directs the Tax Collector
to accept the taxes of persons and cor
porations on personal property and real
estate amounting to $97,257, of which the ;
city will receive about IGu.tHK). These taxes ,
were recently tendered in payment by the
property owners,, who refused to pay
taxes on certain bonds since held by the
Supreme Court to bo unassessable. The
resolution recites:
Resolved^ That on account of the. condition of
the clty'sr funds and without establishing a
lÂ»recedent the Tas Collector be and is hereby
directed to receive and collect from such per
sons, associations and corporations the total
amount of personal property and real estate
taxes assrsseii to them, excepting the taxes
on such bonds as were decided by the Supreme
Court In the case of the Germania Trust com
pany, appellant, vs. the city and county of
fc-an Francisco, respondent, as not assessable
to said persona, associations or corporations.
Resolved, Tlrat the Auditor be and he is
hereby directed to cancel the penalties pro
vided to be collected by statute from delinquent i
taxpayers from such persons, associations and ,
corporations who tendered their taxes less the
amount of the taxes on the bonds claimed not
to be assessable to them, provided the said
taxes are paid before July 1, 1300.
The Mayor said he had been informed
by State controller Colgan that the latter
would be guided in the matter of the
State's interest in the taxes by the advice ,
of the Attorney General as to whether the
penalties for delinquency could be waived.
Colgan had telephoned to Tax Collector
Scott that the State would not waive the
penalty, butÂ«. letter explaining the mat-)
ter would be mailed to reach here this ]
morning. Scott says, however, that the â¢
State Is not concerned with the penalty,
but that It Is a city proposition solely. He
intends to get the opinion of the City At
torney as to whether the Board of Supery
visors may order the waiving or the pen
alty. '
The assessment on personal property on
which the taxes ' are now delinquent
amounts to $5,072,859, divided among vari
ous corporations.
The real estate delinquent taxes are:
Bank of California, $1426 25; German Bank,
$97189; Savings and Loan Society, $698 46;
Security Savings Bank, $138 55; Columbus
Savings and Loan Society. $5 4G; La So
ciete Krancalse. $29 34; San Francisco Sav
ings Union. $3277 9S; Union Trust Com
pany, $2750 63; Fair estate, $1340 6S; Mackay
& Dey, $329 10. Total, $11,568 34.
A resolution was also adopted directing
the City Attorney to take measures to
determine the rights of the city regarding
the commissions on poll taxes and col
lateral inheritance taxes, with a view to
having the moneys transferred to the mu
nicipal funds. The resolution says:
Whereas, The poll tax receipts and the col
lateral inheritance tax receipts belong to the
State school fund, but the commissions for the
collections thereof paW by the State are In
dispute; and
Whereas, The Treasurer has in his custody
the poll tax receipts deposited by the As
sessor, settlement of which will be made ac
cording to law with the State on the first
Monday of July, and also the commissions on
the collateral inheritance tax, collection of
which, is made b? the Treasurer and settle
ment with the State already made on May
7: and
Whereas, The charter requires all fees to be
paid Into the treasury for the city, but the
State law allows the fees to the Assessor and
Treasurer rfspectlvely, which has- caused a
conflict of authority: therefore be it
Resolved, TÂ»hat the City Attorney be re
quested to immediately take proper legal steps
to determine the city's rights and duties In
the premises and to enforce the same.
The ordinance empowering the Board
of Health to quarantine persons, houses
and districts when in its judgment it is
deemed necessary to prevent the spread
of infectious or contagious diseases was
finally passed.
The consideration of the ordinances ex
tending the pound limits to the county line
and regulating the construction of thea
ters was deferred until next Monday.
The resolution authorizing: William F.
Nolte to kill migrating birds within the
city limits In the interest of science was
passed to print. Nolte's application was
indorsed by President Jordan of Stan

MEMORIAL DAY OBSERVANCES.
]\A ANY of the more influential papers of the
1 \ country devoted a considerable part of their
* Memorial day editorials to considerations of
the change which has taken place in the attitude of
the public toward the celebration of the day. That
change has long been evident, and it increases with
the years. The observances of the day arc under
going a process of evolution, and it is clear the pre
vailing tendency is to make it a holiday of rejoicing
and not of mourning.
It is everywhere agreed that the day will continue
to be celebrated and will never lose its hold upon the
people, but it is argued that coming as it does at the
beginning of the northern summer, the attractiveness
cf nature at that season will make it more and more
a general pleasure day, observed in commemoration
of the preservation of the Union rather than as a day
of grief for the heroic dead. f
Commenting on the change the Philadelphia
Record says: "It is in this phase of the evolution of
Memorial day as a popular institution that the secret
of its general observance in Northern communities
is to be found. The venerated survivors of a historic
struggle have been unable to confine the liberated
energies of their descendants to the solemn duties
which in earlier years made Decoration day an occa
sion of pompous and magnificent ceremonial. The
soldiery' graves are x strewed with flowers, orators in
dulge in patriotic reminiscence, and the martial spirit
is aroused and kindled anew in 'many a veteran's
breast, while young America is far afield intent only
en breaking records or winning in some hard-fought
competition. In this dual employment of the day is
its strongest guarantee of long continuance and ever
increasing respect and appreciation."
The New York Tribune concludes that the reverent
and loving memory of those whose deeds suppressed
the rebellion will be always associated with the ob
servance of the day, but adds: "A grander thought
remains, that the people have reached through strife
snd crime and suffering a deeper unity and a more
genuine devotion than would have . been possible
without attempted disunion and defeat. Thus those
vvho were beaten can in truth enjoy the result as
heartily as those who were victors. When the whole
nation, North and South alike, advances to a higher
c.nd better conception of the meaning and the virtue
of free government, then. indeed Memorial day may
become in no sense a sectional but a national thanks
giving."
The New York Sun with its usual boldness grap
ples with the problem by suggesting a change in the
manner of observing the day so as to make it ac
cord with the change in public sentiment. It says:
"Instead of remaining a day of mourning, typified
by the flying of flags st halfmast, already funereal
symbols have become incongruous with the sentiment
to which it gives expression. It is no longer a day
of mourning but a holiday to celebrate the integrity
and the solidity of the American nation as one of the
most masterful of the great powers of the world. To
day we arc not weeping over deaÂ»h. but arc
rejoicing in a new and larger national life. We do
not celebrate with lowered .flags the independence
won by the dead of the Revolution, neither shall we
commemorate the restoration of the Union with the
symbols of woe.''
It is to be borne in mind that none of those who
share the belief that Memorial day is to become a day
of rejoicing over a restored Union rather than a "day
of mourning for the dead are in any way lacking in
reverence for the Grand Army, for those of its ranks
who are dead or for, the living who. so faithfully
cherish the memory of thei* departed comrades;
but in their minds the consciousness of the greatness
cf the victory more and more overcomes the sense
of the sacrifice required to gain it, and they hold the
observance of the day will eventually be'made to cor
tc?pond with that sentiment
Members of the G. A. R. Vigorously Protest Against His
Treatment of One of 'I heir Number.
Members of James A. Garfield Post No. 34, G A. R., ar C very indig
nant against Mayor Phelan for his treatment of Sol Cahen, a member ot the
order. ; Mr. Cahen was unanimously recommended by his comrades for a
position on the Memorial day Â«nance committee. Mayor Phelan s reply to
their courteous request was a flat refusal on the ground that Mr. Cahen had
worked against the new charter. . .
The members of James A. Garfield Post No. 34 have voiced their senti
ments of his act in- the following resolutions:
) Whereas, The Mayor of the city and county of San * ran c s^ Â«JJ
9 daily declared that our worthy comrade and past ~^ r
. Sol Cahen, Is not entitled even to an honorary position under the new c _y
5 charter because he was honestly opposed to one of the Vggjg^gS? 'Jl
strument; and whereas, the Mayor deemed it proper to exclude him from^the
5 Memorial day finance committee, although he was unanimously selected as
, a member pf that committee by James A. Garfield Post. G. A. Â«â¢â¢
We. the comrades of Sol Cahen. who have known him Ions and .â¢' a *
5 this meeting of James A. Garfield Post No. *4. G. A. R. most emP^aLy
â¢ protest against this unwarranted discrimination and resent it as an undlgnl
5 fied. unjust and tyrannical exercise of a "little brief authority.
We take pleasure in hereby expressing our unqualified confidence In tnc
, honor, integrity and patriotism of our comrade, who has occupied the hign
\ est office in our order in the sift of the Department of California and Ne\ada,
' and who has at all times by his conduct as a soldier, as a citizen and as a
> man won and maintained the respect of all who know him.
. " We further declare that the action of the Mayor does not In the least
. detract from our comrade and that the insult to which he has been subjected
' endears him still more to his comrades, who will ever esteem and eheriah him
as one of the most worthy members of the Grand Army of the Republic.
5 Resolved. That these sentiments be engrossed and presented to comrade
Sol Cahen and copies be transmitted to the headquarters of the department
, and to the different posts of the G. A. R. of this city.
Adopted unanimously by a rising vote at the meeting of James A. Gar
jfield Post No. 34, G. A. R., held June 5, 1000.
Mayor Pheian's letter to the Post was as follows:
General E. S. Salomon. Parrott Building. Cityâ Dear Sir: Tour letter of May 18 to
hand. I desire to say that I received by the'sair.e mall from Mr. Bally the printed list
of the committee appointed by the Board of Supervisors, which is correct.
The name of Mr. Cahen was originally submitted by me to the board as recommend**
among fifteen others, by a Grand Army committee. Friends of the charter, however, ob
jected to his appointment on the ground that as the K0O appropriated for Memorial day
was for the first time In this city made possible by the charter no one opposed to the
charter should serve under it in any honorary capacity, and that Mr. Cahen had at
tacked its most vital and important provision; hence his name was omitted on final
confirmation of the committee. Yours truly. JAMES D. PHELAN'.

dentally, as it were, he has given us some
work unsurpassed in loveliness. What he
cared for was significance. To make his
ver*e full of meaning, to put as much red
hot experience as possible Into the given
line was his constant effort: and In this
no one has ever succeeded better than he.
It is no wonder that people long thought
him obscure, and that Tennyson laid the
Â«pell of his most melodious numbers upon
the oubllc ear long before the potent,
penetrating force of Browning's work
made itself felt.
At first sight. Indeed, the contrast, be
tween the poÂ«try of Tennyson and Brown
tng seems striking, absolute and extreme.
And yet the longer one thinks and the
more one contemplates them from a dis
tance, with a larger sweep of wisdom, the
more evident it becomes that the same
age gave them birth. In differing ways
their work Ls the expression of deep, un
derlying forces wholly identical, and we
may read In them, if we will, the spiritual
history of their generation. Looking at
them from this point of v^w. what does
their vast and varied work reveal?
It shows us in the first place a period
entirely preoccupied with interest in hn
mar.ity and in human experience.
One might suppose that this was always
the case with pootry: but It had not been
so In the preceding age. To "Wordsworth
and to Shelley nature had been quite as

their passions, as in the Jaeofc-an drama;
they move in freedom. A fatalistic ma
terialism threatened, during much of thÂ«
time -while Tennyson and Bro-wniiis wer*
writing-, to dominate English thought.
Never for one moment does either of these
great imaginations yield to it. Tennyson
in "In Memoriam" is fighting hard against
the insidious foe; nobly he wins the day.
As for Browning, in almost his every
poem tiie power of hi3 art is expended ia
fixing attention, breathless, on one issue.
"Life's business bein? Just the terrtSl*
choice." shall a given sou! which wa ara
watcliing- at the crisis of its fate rise or
fall? "Life Is probation, and this earth
no seal, but starting-point of man." Sucb
i3 the constant burden of hi3 message.
And the wonderful thing about his work,
as about that of Tennyson, ia the constant
vista which it opens into the eternal and
unseen. Man. ia his little life al action.
of passion, of desire. Is sTirroundeti by
spiritual forces, half guessed, half Ig
nored making for redemption or for loss.
This is the gist and cpshot of all that
lovelv series of poems in whica modern
fact "is veiled in anoient legend, but not
conceaJedâ "IdylU cf the Kinc" This is
the underlying consciousness In all
Browning's great early dramas, as In his
monologues, and pre-eminently in the
masterpiece of hisÂ» maturity. "The Rlcg
and the Book." To compare this strange,
sienincant epic with the supreme expres
sion of the mind cf the renaissance in thÂ»
Shakespearean drama is to feel how char
acteristic of the Virt.ori.an aga 13 this ob~
â¢vÂ«^ion with the spiritual aspect of human
experience. In Shakespeare's plays thÂ»
curtain drops at the end. and "the rest Is

leading poems cf Tennyson, the drama
proceeds to be sure, here on th!s vl?!MÂ«

XXIV. THE AGE OF TEXITS'SON
AND BSOWIIING.
BY VIDA D. SCUDDER. V
We arl likely to forget now what was j
doubtless a notable factor in the con- ;
sciousness of both poets â the nature of i
their reception by their contemporaries. â¢
Nothing could present a stronger con- i
trast. Tennyson from the first was the '
darling of the English pecp!e: hailed by ;
his college friends as the poet of the fu- j
ture even In -his '-prentice days, rejoicing
almost steadily in applause that deepened !
as charming volume succeeded volume, j
honored by the laurel greener from the i
brows of Wordsworth, by a substantial !
pension from the government, by the fa- Â¦
vor and friendship of the Queen. No such '
shower of prosperity fell to the lot of
Browning. Recognized indeed from the !
first by a. chosen spirit here and there, he ;
remained for many 'a year in obscurity ,
so far as the general public was concern- j
ed: long ignored, and when the bulk and I
force of his woik fairly brought him at
the soul. All this i* changed in thÂ» Vic
torian pcet5. Nature is still lovely. In
deed, but she has slipped back into a
purely subordinate position, and the
drama cf human experience 211s the Trhcl*
foreground. â¢â¢The r.eed of a world of
c-en. as Browning put It, possesses them:
Became cow self-acn'-Jaiaters.

Tn- human life on which their gaze Is

Customs Collector Jackson has received
a letter from Acting Secretary of the
Treasury O. L. Spautding in relation to
the stopping over at Honolulu of steamers
of the Pacirlc Mail Steamship Company,
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha.
while on their way from San Francisco
to Japan. The laws of tÂ£e United States
with reference to shipping will go into
effect at Hawaii en June 14. and for that
reason all shipping men will be interested
in the letter, which ia as follows:
Collector of Customs. San Francisco: Sir â
Referring to section S3 of the act approved
April 30, 13C0, entitled "An act to provide a
government for Hawaii." the attention of the
department has been directed to the fact thai
it is the practice of the Pacine Mail Company,
the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha. to permit
passengers buying tickets from San Francisco
to Japan <jr vice versa to .proce^l by vessels
of the foreign companies named to Hawaii,
with a stop-over r>rivilÂ»j?e at Honolulu avail
able for a relatively short time. Honolulu not
being the destination or ultimate landing place
of thesÂ« passeriir?rs. The passengers avaiMn?
themselves cf thl3 privilege are siibsequeEtly
carried to their final port of destination by an
other vessel of one at thÂ»se three lines operat
ing- under a Joint schedule.
The department has under consideration the
question o* the legality cf this procedure, ar.il
pending it3 final decision upon the matter you
are hereby authorized to permit the practice
hitherto in vo^ue.
The Overdue Henry Clement.
The gamblers in reinsurance got a sad
setback yesterday. Last week the news
came from England that the Her.ry Clem
ent, on which S5 per cent was paid, had
arrived at her destination. The Liverpool
Journal of Commerce, commenting upon
the news on May 13. .said: . â¢
To hcM the record for slow sailing: is an
achievement of which few ship owners are de
sirous, and is in Its way a novelty. While Ger
many possesses the fastest vessel afloat that
country owns the slowest one also. The Hen
ry Clement fcas arrived ence more. Two hun
dred as<l nincty-cne days from Hamburg- to
Kiaochau direct. Her reinsurance premium
has risen on two occasions to &) guineas per
cent within the last two years. In IS3S she
arrived at Sasta Rosalia. Cal., after a pass
age of 143 days from Hamburg. MoreoTer, Cap
tain Albrandt seems to avoid signaling other
vessels In crder to relieve anxiety. The victual
ing of a vessel for nice months and a half
is no easy matter; and. of course, in the case of
a sailinz vessel, she is generally without such
machinery as condensers. At any rate, her
receat achievement Is the longest voyage ev-r
made.
Acting upon this advice, the underwrit
ers here paid up and Ipoked peasant. A
number of the gamblers received largre
checks and there was great rejoicing: 'on
tho floor of the Merchants' Exchange in
consequence. Now comes the news, how
ever, that the Henry Clement has not ar
rived at Kiaochau and that reinsurance
on her is again being quoted at SO
pufneas. The brokers are now hunt
ing up their clients and getting back the
money paid out under the impression that
the ship had arrived. It Is not .ill plain
sailing, however, as some of the gamblers
protest strongly against returning he
money they received.
Strike at Oregon Dock.
The longshoremen employed by the Or
egon Railway and Navigation Company
went out on strike yesterday morning.
They have been getting 30 cents an hour
and 40 cents for overtime for months past.
but a few days ago they came to the con
clusion that an advance on those rates
was in order. Tuesday night they made
a demand on the boss stevedore for 40
cents an hour and 50 cents an hour over-
time. Their demand was refused ,-uid yes
terday morning the men refused to work.
The boss stevedore searched the water
front from the Mail dock to Meisrgs wharf
for labor, but could not secure a man.
He went to the employment agencies, but
failed again there, so he went back to
the wharf and agreed to pay the long
shoremen the rate they demanded. The
men went back to work and everything
Is now moving along quietly around the
Oregon dock.
Harbor Commissioners Meet-
Messrs. Kilburn. Harney and Herold
were all present at the meetine of the
Harbor Commission held yesterday. Chief
Wharfinger Henderson reported that ow

at times. President Foster of the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway will confer
with the commission to-day in order to
straighten the matter out.
The matter of dredging Channel street
between Third and Sixth streets was dis
cussed. Chief Engineer Holmes reported
that 133,571 cubic -vards would have to be
dredged, at an average cost of 10 cents a
yard. On the motion of Commissioner
Herold. it was (decided to notify all the
people who had petitioned to have the

like to confer with them on the subject.
A second -petition was received yester
day asking the board to dredge Channel

The petitioners were notified that the
matter would be considered as soon as

The possibility of a consolidation In the

keenly than the teachers of the respective

the faculty o( the Girls" High School Is
unanimous in deelarir.jr such a bid for the
patronage as unprofessional. They are
naturallv indignant, and while they would
not think of doing such a thing them
selves they are not averse to speaking a
good word for themselves and letting their
many pupils do likewise.
Of course, if the spirit of trade is to
become part and parcel of the schooi3

Chicago Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. June 6.â Wheat was active to-day
and strong because of anxiety over the North
west crop situation and a reduction In the Ohio
crop figures. July closing lfjl^c over yester
day. Corn closed He lower and oats a shade
higher. Provisions thrived under a good out
side demand and closed strong, a shado to
12V4c to 13c Improved.
Yesterday the wheat pit was half deserted;
to-day It was crowded, and every man In It
was busy. The Ohio crop report started the
advance. It put the condition at 29.30 points
under the Government report for May and the
lowest since 1860. Only ten counties reported
a probability of raising even half a crop. These
figures looked to traders like a practical
wiping out of the Ohio crop, which last year
was 40,000,000 bushels. In the pit It was pre
dicted that the Indiana crop was In even worse
shape than In the ' ulster State. The Daily
Trade Bulletin reduced Its figures on the es
timated winter wheat yield from 374 000 000
bushels to 340,000.000 buÂ»hels. July wheat opened
a shade hlpher at C7fie7Vic and advanced early
to 67%O67%c, nround which figures the mar
ket hung for gome time. Then the Northwest
damage claims began to show their effect
There were no good rains, the wires reported'
and from all sections came claims of Injury
to the crop. One Dakota center declared that
tw-o more weeks of the present weather would
ffpoll the crop and that under the most favor
able circumstances the Dakotas could raise
only a fair, supply. The damage claims were
given an appearance of sincerity by, the buy
ing orders which accompanied them. The
Southwest had been a good buyer early but
the Northwest soon took the lead -and held It
to the end. During the latter half of the ses
sion July advanced to CSVÂ»c and closed strong
l@l'/4c. over yesterday at 68Kc. The cash trade
was slow. Primary receipts were 455,000 bushels
compared with Â£36.000 bushelH. last year. Min
neapolis and Duluth reported 331 cars, : against
556 cars a year. ago.. Local, receipts .were flfty

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. June 6.â About midway of to
day's session of the ftock market there was a
tise of three points In New Jersey Central on '
rumors of control by Baltimore and Ohio. This |
incident offered an Isolated feature of streneth I
\ In the day's market s.n<\ caused the only brief
respite frcm the mood of depression which jre
valled all day. The rr.cff effective single factor
was the warlike development in China. This
influence u a? reflected in New York from for- j
eigr. stock market"- from the opening herÂ», and
London's actual snles in this market on that
account ran up to about 50,0W shares, half
of which were Atchlson preferred.
Even as a direct influence this Felling had
! a notably weakening effect In so narrow a
market as new prevails. The sympathetic ef- j
marked. Wall street entertains no great ap- i
pretension that the United Ptates will become
indirectly involved in the dlftlcultles in China.
Hut commitments of American capital in for
eipn money markets "and the extension of
American commercial interests have ifrowti to
such proportions that any event which would i
precipitate liquidation in foreign markets must i
l>e reflected directly and strongly In the United |
States. Bennies the news from China, foreign !
markets \verÂ«< affected by the tightening of the |
rncney rates in Lcndnn and Paris and a
slightly easier tcne In the Berlin money market |
was not sufficient to offset other d^pressinn j
factors. The break in the foreign prices of iron
and rumors of further concessions in Iron i
prices in this country increased the weakness
of stocks both abroad and in this country.
News oi the domestic iron trade were con
fused, reports of declining prices being mingled J
with reports of reopening of some mills re
cer.tly closed down. Tennessee Coal was the
w"ea*iest of tlie steel prcup and lost 2**i. In the
general lift, prices were weak throughout, but ,
stocks vhich have shown some strength re
cently were most affected. Atchlson preferred,
St. Pnul. Ilaltirr.cre and Ohio, Union Pacific and
Louisville were examples. Denver and Uto
Grande preferred fell IH points on rumors of
j the acquisition of the Colorado Midland by
] rival iiuereFts. nnd Great Northern preferred
! declined four points.
The bond market weakened in sympathy with
stocks and on a moderate volume of business.
Trtal Fales. par value. $1,195,000. United States
bonds were unchanged on bid quotations.

Condition of Trade.
The New York circular of Henry Clews pays:
"The local situation is sound: an i while the i
"boom' must how be considered a matter of j
history there is nothing discouraging la the
T-ture. The day of abnormal profits Is over |
and Â«eÂ« net expected to continue. Possiblj- |
some dullness may be experienced until trade ,
eettles into more normal conditions, but this j
mill be only temporary- Merchandise r&lues i
have alreaiy recr-ded considerably from high- j
â 'liter mark, and they cannot decline much I
further Without bringing In a r.ew set of orders i
which have been held back for just such an ;
opportunity. It Is this 'held-back' business j
upon which we can confidently predict a con- i
tinuance of business activity under more etaM" j
conditions than existed six months ago. Credit
I.-.- not bÂ»en unduly erpar.cJed ; overproduction
Js not yet in sight: confidence In the future I
prevails everywhere and there is no visible
check to "new enterprises. The trust mania is
ever and Fpeculation has not been pushed to
the danger point. An important factor In our
lavor is the wonflc-rful increase In the foreign
demand for American manufactures, which is
bound to continue and play an important part
Jn, cur foreign trade returns, as Â¦ well as an
unlimited outlet for American skill a:vl en
terprise.
Â¦â¢The money market continues in a condition j
favornt.le to operation* for a rise. Bank re- i
fervor are Increasing; there is less prospect of
the treasury injuriously absorbing funds; and j
the epfdal demands for accommodation which
resulted from linancins the big trusts and con
solidations lart year will not be a factor this
eumrner or the coming fall. The demands from
later on; but the monetary outlook In general
tc fcr continued easo. especially since the close
of the African war removes one of the chief
Incentive* for gold vxiÂ»>rtB. Balancing the
Various conditions for and against the market
we are inclined to take a favorable view of
the future. Borne stocks may show occasional
tf-rr.porary v:rakness, tut good securities will
prove a purchase on all decided reactions.
Two important disturbances, the gas and sugar
Â»ars. are out of the way. and this will remove
mtmt have been serious obstacles to a belter
market."

HAVE A FAIR CHANCE
Judge Morrow Decides That Procf
of Guilt Must Be Established
Here.
The whole of yesterday forenoon was
occupied In United States Circuit Judge
Morrow's court in the argument of coun
sel in the matter of the extradition of Ju
lian Biddulph Arnold, a son of Sir Edwin
ArncM, on a charge of embezzlement, and
at the conclusion of the pleas Judge Mor
row decided that no man should be ex
tradited to a foreign country on a crimi
nal charge unless sufficient evidence
should have been produced to convince
the Court Commissioner or other com
mitting magistrate of the guilt of the ac
cused.
In the present rase Arnold protested his
innocence, but said that he would not op
pose the extradition proceedings and
would waive examination. Afterward be
ing informed that creditors in London
were attempting to work upon the feel
icgrs of his relatives by threats of expos
ure, he derr.anot^l a trial and a writ of
habeas corpus wss issued. Bert Sehles-
Inger of the law firm of Denson &.Schles
inger appeared for Arnold, .and Oormac
& Donohoe for the British Government.
The prisoner's wife sat behind him tn
court and appeared to be very rau'* agi
tated, but when the decision was rendered
ffcp was overjoyed. The saddest counte
nance In the room was that of Secret Ser
vice Agent Hazen. who has b'een engaged
to. take Arnold to Entrland in case the
accused should b<? extradited.
The prisoner will be kept at his hotel
in Berkeley, he paying all the expenses.
The examination before Commissioner
Heacock will take place in about a month,
by which time Â»he accused will have re
ceived his evidence from England-

children â a girl aged 6 years and a>boy
two years older. She was 3*3 years of age

Mrs. Broder arose from the dinner table
last night and retired to her room. She

minutes.
Mrs. Mary Broder, wife of C. D. Broder,
a bookbinder In the employ of Frank Mol

drinking carbolic acid at her home, 4&)
Eddy street. The unfortunate woman had
suffered from asthma for a number of

Albert Schenck Swallowed Carbolic
Acid and Left Wife and Five
Children Mourning.
Albert Schenck, a maker of picture
frames, committed suicide yesterday fore
r.ocn by swallowing carbolic add. He re
sided with bis wife and five children at
10S Wolfe street, on Bernal Heights, and
became despondent because he had on one
of his Iesrs an ulcer that seemed to be in
curable. "This affliction, or rather his mor
bid exaggeration of It. caused hhn to be
come temporarily insane. The fact that
while working at his trade he was obliged
to rest the weight of his body on one leg
worried him very much, and he often
complained to his fellow workmen.
Schenck was working- for M. C. Ansbro
& Co., 113S Sutter street. Yesterday fore
noon, without saying anything to the man
who was working alongside of him. he
went to a drug store on the corner of Sut
ter and Polk streets and bought a small
bottle of carbolic add. Taking it to his
work bench he swallowed the contents
and fell to the floor, writhing with the
pain of the corrosive fluid. Medical aid
was summoned, but it came too late.

Commenced.
The preliminary examination of Police
man E. N. Boukofsky on the charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon was com
menced before Jud^e iiogan yesterday.
Boukofsky was in court, and no sign of
his recent illness was apparent. He was
defended by Attorney H. H. Davis.
P. O. Driscoll. the gripnian, did not seem
to be a willing witness. He testified that
when Boukofsky met him on the vacant
lot at Jackson and Lyon streets the po
liceman had a revolver in his right hand.
Boukofoky ptaced him under arrest and
aa they walked along the mororman
tripped up Boukofsky and ran, taking
shelter on the porch of E. H. Korton's
house. Boukofsity chased him and kept
blowing his police whistle, which he held
in his left hand. Airs. Horton insisted on
Driscoll leaving the porch, and he con
tinued his flight, escaping Â«n a passing
car.
E. H. Horton testified to seeing Dris
coll on the parch of his house. Driscoll
told him that he was betn? pursued by a
drunken policeman. He saw Boukofsky
blowinsr his whistle and he appeared to
be drunk. Henry D. Morton testified that
he saw Driscoll jump on the car.
This closed the case for the prosecution,
and a continuance was granted till Satur

Fruit growers of Alaraeda County have
threatened to organize as a protection
against the alleged cannery combine
which has offered them a low price for
the produce of their orchards. As was
published in The Call, the determined
stand taken by the orchardlsts across the
bay was hailed with great satisfaction
throughout the Stater and many promi
nent fruit growers highly commended
such organizations. The fruit growers
have expressed a determination not to
sacrifice their crops to ttie canners under
any circumstances, but instead will pre
pare them for the dried fruit market or
ship them to Eastern markets at their
own risk.
The controversy between thÂ« canners
and the fruitmen has reached stich a
point that their relations are considerab'y
strafned. The fruit growers have decline!
to accept the c!?ers made by the canners,
and unless an amicable settlement can be
reached it will probably result in a heavy
toss to both sides.

who compose the committee of fruit
growers of Alameda County. The letter
is as follows:

We would n.-.t care- to take to excee-i 10 per

"I wish to call attention to tne fact
that this letter was read at a meeting of
the growers." said Mr. Font ana, "but
while the remarks of some of the grow
ers were published, the letter was
omitted. In justice to the association it
should have been."
Mr. Fontana's statement follows:
At the prices which we have made for fraits
the largest growers in thÂ« State, who hav
other business lntertata aad who know thÂ«
condition? that prevail, had no hesitancy in
cnntractlns their fruits. If any fair-minded
person will take Into consideration ta* facts
as they exist, namely:
The lareÂ»r crop of cherrtes. apricots ana
pears which prevail here this seaeoa ad com
pared with laat. * ' ,
The lnimense csr>r3 In all th* Ujt* fruit
districts of the East as compared with Last
season whÂ« there was practically nothing-.
The change from an advaru.-inÂ£ market witlj
a heavy demand to a declining market wUh
Indifference on part of the buyers.
The fact that in car line retailers, wholesalers
and canners themselves carry heavy Â»tock3
from last season, only one conclusion can b*
drawn, namely, that oar prtcÂ«Â» are fair and
reasonable.
We maintain stilt further that cur prices for
the staple varieties, apricots, peaches and
p#ars. will net the growers oa tfte av^ag* more
money than they -w!!! secure in any other way,
that Is. bj shipping East or drying.

are In good physical condition. Captain

The reeswin piven for the defeats Is tho

regular feyittdu ar.d rules which are ad

had this to say:
"We owe alt mir defeats to the supe
riority of the Eastern athletes, who have
he>?n "developed t>y vastly superior train
ing methotis. We know absolutely noth
ing of training a track team compared
with Eastern methods. We were siven a
splendid reception at Tale and the ath
letes and men could not do enough for us.
"Cadoean was considered a wonder.
Many believe he has the making of the
fastest sprinter In the world. For fifty
yards he. has no superior to-day. Wool
sey and 'Piaw both came in for praise.
The performance of both with the
weights was considered marvelous. Plaw
â¢will not go to the Paris games, but will
return here a little later. He objects to
the professional tone that joining the New
York Athletic Club would give him."
The rest of the team, except Service.
Moser and Broughton. will return next

The Board of Education discovered yes
terday that no record had been kept of
the recent proceedings tn the trial of Prin
cipal Kilpatrfck of the Business Evening
School on charges preferred by Walter S.
Brann. Some fear was expressed that the
neglect might invalidate the board's de
cision in having dismissed Kilp&trick from
his position.
Secretary Hanson said he had been told
that no record was necessary.
"The trial was an open proceeding," yaid
Denman, "and an official record should
have been kept for future reference. Let
it be- understood that in future alt such
inquiries will be recorded in the same
manner as the minutes of a regular meet-
Ing." â¢Â¦ -
Other members of the board were aston
ished to - hear that no record had been
kept. The trial lasted four days, many
witnesses were examined, yet there ia not
any evidence to ;how that Kilpatrtck has
either been tried or dismissed.

present when the case was called for
hearing.
Mr. Morrison, on behalf of Mrs. Dr
Emma L. Merritt. who claims the library
as a personal . bequest, objected to- the
hearing on the ground that a Judgment
at this time against her would preclude
an appeal. He suggested that the hear
ing be continued until after the conclu

attacking thÂ« validltv of decpdf-nt'a will
Others in interest insisted that the hear

Judge Coffey decided that the mattet
should be heard, but as- the proceedings
will necessarily be lengthy the court con
tinued the case until August 22, at which
time the application for the sale will be

OAKLAND, June 6.â The shipments of
freight by way of Long wharf have in
creased until thirty carloads of sugar
alone are being handled from that point.
The Increased shipments have necessi
tated the employment of fifty extra men,
switch tenders and other train hands.
Among the sugar ships that docked re
cently at the wharf are the Irmgard, Amy
Turner. Alden Besse. H. C. Wright and
Roderick Dhu. The Irmgard Is taking a
cargo of sewer pipe and lumber for Hono
lulu. The bark Albert is loading machin
erv for the islands.
Large quantities of sewer pipe are be
ing snipped to the Islands. There are
forty carloads at the yards awaiting ship-
The* new ten-hour time schedule at the
machine shops will go into effect next
Friday. The hours of work are always
longer in the summer than in winter on
account of the greater amount of work
and the longer days. r^'*
The railroad company is making prep
arations to handle the heavy rush of busi
ness that occurs annually during the
summer and fall months. Nearly all the
available engines and - cars are being
placed in repair and considerable new
rolling stock has bÂ«en acquired. The pas
senger coaches are also being renewed and
repaired under the direction of Master Car
Rtpairer Henry Englebright.
HEAVY SHIPMENTS FROM
THE OLD LONG WHARF
MAKILA, June 6.â A dispatch from Can
don, dated June 4, says Major P. C.
March's men of the Thirty-third Regi
ment returned to Candon to-day by
steamer from Aparri. A majority of them
were ready for the hospital. They are
thin and weak, having traveled 250 miles
in the mountains, during which they suf
fered greatly from hunger. Of the ftfty
horses" which started with the battalion
thirteen survived. The remainder died on
the march or ,1 ell into the canyons. The
battalion, practically collapsed at Pial,
thirty miles from Tuguegarao, as the re
sult of fevers and exhaustion. Eighty
seven of the men were conveyed from Pial
to Tuffuegarao in bull carts, and those
falling on the way were carried in litters
by the Igorottis with the column.
The omcers accompanying Major March
were Captains Henry L. Jenkinson and
Edward Davis, Lieutenants Carroll Power
and Frank L. Case and Dr. John O.
Greenwall, assistant surgeon. They say
it is all guesswork as to whether Agui
naldo was shot. Before the Americans
struck Sagat the insurgent chief divided
his forces into parties of ten, following
different trails. The ojflcer shot was per
haps Aguinaldo's secretary or adjutant.
The report among the natives of the re
gion is that Agjilnaldo was wounded in
the shoulder.
The captured papers show that nearly
all the presidents installed by the Ameri
cans in General Young's territory are
treacherous and have been making regu
lar reports to Aguinaldo as to the disposi
tion and movements of American troops,
and that they have been collecting and
forwarding taxes. The papers also prove
the disloyalty of the native telegraph op
erators whom the Americans retained on
the Cayaguan Valley line. When Tirona
surrendered the Filipino forces in that
section these operators professed loyalty
and took the oath of allegiance. But it is
now shown that they had been sending
Aguinaldo copies of important telegrams
exchanged between the American officials.
Letters were also found relating to large
contributions forwarded to Aguinaldo
from Spanish and other foreign business
men.
WASHINGTON, June 6.â The President
to-day sent to the Senate the reply to the
statements made by Aguinaldo In his
"true version of the Philippine revolu
tion." In th&t statement Aguinaldo says
among other things that the Spaniards
had captured six guns from the American
soldiers in front of Manila before the sur
render of that city to the American forces
and that they were recaptured by the Fil
ipinos and returned to the Americans.
This statement was referred to in the
Senate, which the correspondence fur
nished to-day shows caused Secretary
Root to refer it to General F. V. Greene,
who was in charge of the American
troops, with the request for an explana
tion. General Greene referred Aguinaldo's
statement to the battalion and batrery
commanders who were engaged against
the Spaniards at the time referred to nna
he forwarded their replies in refutation
of the charge.
General Greene himself says: "The
statements made by Aguinaldo are abso
lutely without foundation: each and every
one of them is untrue. The United States
did not fall bacR; did not abandon a single
ritte nor a single field gun; did not make
a precipitate retreat; the Filipinos did not
rush to our assistance; did not recapture
the rifles and field guns, and did not re
turn them to the Americans. The Filipinos
took no part in the engagements between
the Spaniards and American troops. Every
single statement in the extract quoted In
your letter is false."
Story of the Killing of Aguinaldo
Unconfirmed, but It Is Believed
He Was Wounded in the
Shoulder.

Hoots and Jeers greeted the conclusion
of the speech. Secretary Finn took the
center of the platform and said that Mr.
Kaufmann was one of the most disap
pointed office seekers in the party. He
then told of the many positions he aspired
to and wound up by saying that even now
he had an application before the Civil
Service Commission. Cheers greeted the
statement.
Delegate Coffey Interrupted with a point
of order and said Mr. Finn and Mr. Kauf
mann ought to proceed without indulging
In personalities. * Whereupon Mr. Kauf
mann denied that he was indulging in per
sonalities. He said that his statements
had been doubted and he believed it was
his dutv. to< refute allegations against him.
"Mr. Chairman," he yelled, "the finest
position in the gift of the munlcipality
could not buy me now or at any other
time."
Within five minutes points of order, mo
tions, amendments to amendments and
substitutes for the whole were hurled at
the unhappy chairman.
All the lists being in. Secretary Finn
read the names of the men chosen In the
Thirty-eighth District. Amid tho cries of
"sit down," "shut up," "hire a hall" and
other choice advice, Kaufmann apaln rose
to voice- his protest. "I don't want to be
debarred of my legal right to speak," he
yelled. "I protest on the ground that no
meeting was called!" | Emll Pohll moved
the adoption of the maiority report and
it was carried unanimously. Kaufmann
rose to points of order, but he was sadly
ignored. He then attempted to read his
minority report, but it was never heard.
Nothing daunted, he gave notice that he
would continue his battle at the coming
convention.
Then came the fight in the Forty-fourth*
Assembly District. Dr. Baeigalupi and II..
J. Sullivan were opposed b>; Italian In
terpreter Demartlni, Baseball Umpire
Jack O'Connor and Senator Feeney.
Again the convention was filled with
noise. It rose to a perfect bedlam and
the man with the loudest voice won out.
The majority report was accepted despite
the fact that "Three Strikes" O'Connor
swore that County Commltteeman
Schimpf's name was forged to the docu
ment and the last named was present to
swear he had not signed it. A motion to
adjourn was made and carried. - , -. >-\.
O'Connor looked disgustedly at the
chairman because he put the motion,
thus crowding O'Connor and his men out
of a chance for a hearing, and sadly, said,
"You're a lobster."

chosen: t-Â»

the admission of California as a State
held a meeting last night In Native Sons'
Hall, Chairman Phelau presiding. There
were present a large number of the rep
resentatives of the several parlors, show-
Ing the enthusiasm that Is felt by those
who propose to make the celebration the
grandest that San Francisco . has ever
seen.
The chairman announced that he would
within a few days name the most import
ant of all committees, the one that will
have charge of the finances. The several
sub-committees presented partial reports.
The committee. on decorations announced
that it had secured headquarters at 310
Pine street, and that it was obtaining
facts and figures as to bunting, electric
ity for the illumination of the City Hall,
the ferry building, the Hall of Justice
and several other large buildings, togeth
er with other details that will come under
its supervision. '
The committee on ball reported that it
favored the giving of a grand Invitation
al ball on the night of the 10th of Sep
tember. . , ..
The literary committee reported that It
would present an outline of Its pro
gramme at the next meeting.
The committee on naval parade was au
thorized to add George H. S. Dryden and
six persons who shall not be members of
the order to the committee.
The committee on halls and headquar
ters announced that it had secured from
the Palace Hotel management four rooms
on the lower floor for use as headquarters,
and the committee was authorized to put
these quarters into shape at once.
It was resolved that any member or a
sub-committee who shall absent himself
from two successive meetings, except on
account of absence from the city or sick
ness, shall be removed from that com
mittee.
E. Myron Wolf, S. V. Costello, J. H.
Grady, D. A. Ryan and C. H. Turner were
named a special committee to determine
the scope of the celebration, that is, the
length of its duration and character. The
impression prevailed that the . Natives
should whoop It up for one week.
It was decided that the official title of
the celebration shall be semi-centennial
anniversary day celebration.
After Friday week, to which time there
was an adjournment, the committee will
meet every Friday. '.
CALIFORNIA'S
JUBILEE YEAR
CELEBRATION
School Board to Investigate
Recommendations of |
Examiners.
The Board of Education Inaugurated a
new plan at yesterday's meeting when it
refused to adopt the recommendations of
the Board of Kxamlnation regarding the
renewal of primary and grammar grade
certificates of school teachers. Hereafter
the investigations of the examiners as to
the legal qualifications of pedagogues will
lie supplemented by further inquiry on
the part of the School Board before the
renewals are finally granted.
The point was raised by Director Den
man when Deputy Superintendent Kings
bury, who is also secretary of the Board
of Examiners, reported that in his last
communication he had recommended that
the grammar grade certificate of Miss
McGreevy.be renewed, when in fact it
should have been the primary grade cer
tificate. Miss McGreevy is the teacher
whom .the board suspended for one year
for habitual absence arid not so reporting
, to her principal.
"I move," said Director Denman, "that
the recommendations be adopted with the
exception of. those relating to primary and
grammar grades. I want to know the ex
act status and classification of teachers
before their certificates are renewed."
"I desire to state," said Mr. Kingsbury,
"that the Examination Board does not
grant certificates to teachers before ob
taining a letter of recommendation from
principals. We do not investigate the per
sonal character of any teacher."
Denman demanded the same right to
make investigations as the Board of Ex
aminers possessed and; the matter went
over for one week. The teachers tempo
rarily affected by the new order are:
Grammar grade certificates: Mrs. M. L.
Cohnrelch. Mrs. Blanche S. Wertheimer,
Miss Elsie L. Moraghan, Miss Lydla E.
Grafe. Miss A. H. Lyon. Miss E. H. Lyon,
Miss P M. Nolan, M13S Rao Cohen, Mrs.
B. L. MacDonald.
Primary certificates: Miss Sarah
Karsky and Miss M. C. Barry.*
A copy of resolutions adopted by the
Public Improvement Central Club, which
is affiliated with thirty different improve
ment clubs. Was read at the meeting and
concerns the fight now being made for
better textbooks. The resolutions are:
''â¢Whereas, President Wheeler of the University
of California has condemned several of the text
books ot.tlie'&tcte series as unworthy and In
adequate to the modern needs of the schools
of the State.
Resolved,' That the secretary of this club be
authorized to write to Presidents Wheeler and
Jordan,' State Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion Kirk and all presidents of county Boards
of Education in reference to the above.
A; communication was sent by the club
(requesting thei board to give its opinion
as to the best plan to be adopted in order
that the defects Â¦. of the present system
might be remedied. Consideration- how
ever, was postponed until the next meet
ing. â¢
Mrs. MIehl, a substitute teacher In the
department, made. an earnest appeal that
substitute teachers be paid $40 per month
Instead of $1 per diem for reporting and
$2 50 per day when teaching, the present
rates recently adopted by the board. Mrs
Mlehl said that substitutes had been given
but eight days' work in May and would
not be employed at all during vacation
The board decided to hold a special meet
ing on Thursday afternoon to consider the
matter, when the recommendation of Su-
NEW RULE FOR
THE RENEWAL OF
CERTIFICATES
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 7, 1900
fiTT? MID scenes of uproarious confusion
// \\ the Phelan programme was crowd-
J/ ed through the Democratic local
convention at Native Sons' Hall
last night. The Influence of the court cir
cular had been invoked to bring out a full
attendance of the county ,committeemen,
as only sixty-nine members attended the
convention last Friday night. When the
roll was called last night the secretary
reported seventy-five present. Despite
every effort of the Phelanltes to bring out
the full representation thirty-seven com
mitteemenâamong them Max Popper and
Jasper McDonaldâ declined to grace the*
occasion with their presence. What the
convention lacked in numerical strength
was made good, however, in noise.
The tumult began immediately on con
clusion of tho rollcall. and there was
scarcely a lull in the storm until the ad
journment was declared. ,-p'iiH
Charles W. Fay, the private Civil Ser
vice Commissioner of Mayor Phelan, was
on the scene early to see that the slate
was not fractured. Before the convention
was called to order an indignant Demo
crat smote him in the mouth, but he man
aged to preserve the slate unbroken.
J. D. Maxwell, who was recently pro
moted to the position of chairman of the
convention to succeed Jasper McDonald,
brought to the office all the dainty graces
of demeanor which have made him so
popular as a master of social function^ in
select circles of Belvedere. He wient
through the storm in a dazed and dreqmy
manner, hardly realizing what he had
done when he declared the convention jad
journed. lie put motions without' regard
to. their sequence or order and declared
results In obedience to the loudest cajl.
Threat of Appeal to State Body.\
There was an exciting scene when Leo
Kaufmann charged that civil service had
been polluted to obtain control of the
Tliirty-elghth Assembly District. Pne
lan's name was not mentioned, but the ac
cusation was made that two of the com
rnitteemen had been given places in the
municipal service. The inference was un
avoldaole that the Mayor had prostituted
civil service to secure recognition in the
convention. The charge was distinctly
made that means other than moral influ
ence had been used to bring about a re
port.in favor of the delegates recommend
ed by Charles S. Fay. Mr. Kaufmann
threatened to take his protest and appeal
to the Democratic State Convention, at
Sacramento.
There were loud and angry protests
against the acceptance of the list sub
mitted by the Forty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict commttteemen. The genuineness of
A. H. Schlmpf's signature to the ma
jority report was ctiallenged. Democrats
who claimed they were cheated and "done
up" by the programmers appealed to the
reporters of the press to witness that
Scnimpfs name was signed u> a report
which had been rejected. Investigation
disclosed the fact that the honored name
of Schimpf was signed to both reports
and neither signature seemed to be in
Phelan's handwriting. The betrayed and
turned-down Democrats of the Forty
fourth insist that skulduggery was em
ployed and Schimpf's name was taken In
The convention adjourned without in
struction to give any of the delegates cre
dentials. The secretary was not com
manded to certify the list chosen to the
State convention. Nothing was done in
a formal or regular manner.
The proceeding was a grand farce from
the start to the' tinlsh.- As a matter of
fact the seventy-five commltteemen pres
ent represented the Phelan element of the
Democratic party In San Francisco and
nothing else. The Democratic workers
and voters had no voice in the selection
of delegates to the State Convention. Â¦
Charley Gets Slugged.
Delegates to the convention began to ar
rive in the basement of Native Sons' Hall
at 8 o'clock. The lirst event of the even-
Ing and which eclipsed anything else that
was said or done during the session that
followed was a fist fight between a lusty
Democrat named Ryan and one Gianninl.
Charles Fay attempted to act as referee
and peacemaker and received a right hook
in the mouth for his trouble. Tne battle
between Kyan and Gianninl was short and
decisive. Kyan upbraided Gianninl for cer
tain actions of the latter, which he
claimed were not worthy of a Democrat
or a gentleman. Having delivered him
self of this statement Mr. Ryan proceeded
to use his "dukes" and succeeded in muss
ing Mr. Giannini's pompadour and cravat.
The peacemaker. Fay, stepped between
the battling ones and earned the usual re
ward. Other Democrats sprang between
the contestants and hostilities ceased.
Ryan was escorted from the hall in tri
umph by his followers. Soon afterward
Sergeant Helms and Officer Wilson ap
peared, and It is due to their presence
that other fistic arguments were not held.
The preliminary sparring being con-
eluded, Chairman Maxwell called the del
egates to order.
Senator Samuel Braunhart moved that
each delegation in its proper order an
nounce its list of delegates to the* conven
tion to be held in Sacramento on June 14.
His motion prevailed and everything went
smoothly until the Thirty-eighih As
sembly District was called upon by
Secretary Finn to announce its se
lections. Chairman Lynch of that
delegation . arose and reeled off eight
names, among them being that of
Charles Fay. Lynch attempted to say
something further, but his talk was
nipped in -the bud by Leo Kaufmann, a
delegate from the Thirty-eighth, who re
nounced his affiliations by taking a seat
among the delegates of the Forty-fourth
District. Kaufmann raised his voice in
protest and Jt was heard above the din
which followed his recognition by the
chairman.
Kaufmann Charges Jobbery.
"I desire, to. challenge the vote of the
Thirty-eighth District," he yelled. "It Is
illegal and I will give my. grounds for it
being so. The votes of. the delegates of
that district have been procured by cor
ruption and I will prove it. In that dis
trict there are six do facto members of
this convention. These six members met
last night to select their delegates to the
Sacramento convention. To secure one
half of the delegation, two positions with
in the gift of the municipality have been
awarded to two of the gentlemen who
signed that list. One of them has received
Ills appointment within the last week. I
protest against the pollution of civil ser
vice, when It Is used to carry an Assem
bly district. I do not believe a taxpayer
of the city and county of San Francisco
should be called upon to pay for a vote
of a man who has selfish motives.
"At the meeting held last night at 1034
Golden Gate avenue, all six were present.
A decision could not be arrived at. "When
I saw the Impossibility of coming to an
agreement I offered to Charles Fay an
equal division of the delegation, which,
In my opinion and In the opinion of every
man who fair and just, was a fair propo
sition. It was rejected because a pre
ponderance of votes was wanted by Fay.
1 did not believe that it was a principle
of Democracy that a person should sacri
fice his conscience and his convictions for
the welfare of one man, whoever he might
be. I refused to accede to his demand.
Let me assure you that these votes were
divided in a very peculiar manner. Three
of them were Independent Democrats, en
gaged in business pursuits, and the other
three from corporations. It was another
fight of Democracy against trusts. We
could not agree. Since last night a
change has occurred. One of the dele
gates, employed by one of the largest cor
porations In this city, has seen fit to
change his vote and it occurs to me. as
it will occur to every other man, that
dubious means were used to get him to
cast his vote.
