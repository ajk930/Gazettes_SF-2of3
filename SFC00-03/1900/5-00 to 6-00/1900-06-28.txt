According to Information given by a gentleman of this city long resident In and very familiar with the topography
of China, it is one of the most Inaccessible. places in the whole country from the sea coast. . Ichang, on the Yangtse, some
250 miles above Hankow, is the nearest point of â¢ approach by navigable water, but the great Kianlong Mountain barrier,
with tho STnling Range, 'stands In the way. The sole pass over the latter has an altitude of â¢ 4100- feet, while there Is none
over the former except far to the east or, west. The great highway between Western and Eastern China passes through
Singan-fu, following the Wel-ho, through the famous Tung-kwan gate to. the Hoangho at the southwestern point of the "great
bend," and there diverging one route goes across Shansi and Chill to Peking, and the other along the valley of the Hoang
ho to Honan, Kaifong and the coast cities.
On account of its peculiar situation and the fertile country around It Singran has for thousands of years been a com
mercial city of the first class. Its population is variously estimated at from 750.000 to 1,500,000 souls. Each of its square
walls, facing- the cardinal points of the compass, is over six miles -long, and is pierced' in the center by a monumental
gate with lofty pavilions. . . ,
Singan-fu, or Slan-fu, Is identified as the Chan-gran of Marco Polo, and ia probably the Thlnal of Ptolemy. It wa3
founded in the twelfth century, B. C, and was for over 2000 years the capital of Eastern China (1122, B. C, to 1250.A. D.)
Under the Tsin dynasty It was the capital of the Middle Kingdom from 906 to 12S0. A. ,D. The province of Shensi. of
which it is the capital, has an area of 67,000 square niiles, and a population of about 12,000,000. With the capital estab

Receives a Gable Message From
Peking Dated June 19 Telling
of the Departure From the
Chinese Capital of Foreign
Diplomats Under Guard.
WASHINGTON, June 27.â The Chinese Minister called thia morning on
the Secretary of State and communicated to him the contents of a
dispatch which he had received from the Tsung-11 Tamen at Peking,
dated on the 19th inst. The dispatch states that the foreign Ministers
had before this data asked permission for the legayen guards to enter
the city, which permission had been granted: that they subsequently asked that
these guards be reinforced, which the Chinese Government was not disposed to
permit. The dispatch then goes on to state that the Consul General at Tientsinâ
supposed to be the French Consul Generalâ had telegraphed, to the Viceroy of
Chill that the foreign admiral had demanded the surrender of the Taku forts
and that the foreign Ministers were shortly to leave Peking for Tientsin with,
their guards.
The developments of to-day respecting China were Important and Interesting.
Tho Chinese Minister's report of the departure of the foreign Ministers and their
guards from Peking greatly relieved the officials here, who took it as the first
tangible evidence that the Imperial Chinese Government had a full realization
of the enormity of permitting the Ministers to come to personal harm and were,
thus undertaking as far as lay in their power to observe the amenities of Inter
national intarcourse.
The keenest interest is shown by the officials to learn the conditions under
which tho Ministers left Peking. Minister Wu's dispatch was ominously silent
on that point, and though the Minister himself maintains almost obstinately
his confidence in the non-existenco of , a state of war. It is generally admitted,
that It will be difficult to accept his conclusion if it shall transpire that the Pe
king Government itself has sent the Ministers away with their passports*-or what
may come to the same thing, with a guard as safe conduct. At the State Depart
ment it is said that should it be explained that the Imperial Government did this
not with a purpose of rupturing diplomatic relations but simply to Insure tho
safety of the Ministers, which they were unable to guarantee as long as they
remained In Peking, then there Is still ground for an understanding.
It is. however, pointed out that in such case the self-confessed Inability of
the Imperial Government to maintain peace and order - at the- capital would
amount to an admission of its utter failure as a Government and would leave
China in a state worse than that of actual war. In either event it row appears
to the satisfaction of the officials that there was absolute Justification for such
Intervention as we have offered In China.
Notice has come to the Government that the cable companies have again re
opened communication telegraphically with Taku and Chefu. This arrangement
has been made by means of the Russian telegraphic system connecting with thÂ»
Siberian Railroad system. A European agent has managed to reopen the lines,
though the means of communication between Chefu and Taku and Tientsin are
tortuous and probably precarious.
The War Department officials still Insist that no orders have gone forth to
send more troops to China than the Ninth Regiment now on Its way from Ma
nila aa<s the Sixth Cavalry, which will sail from San Francisco next Sunday for
Nagasaki and perhaps Taku. It is said that with these two organizations and
the marines now on Chinese soil General Chaffee will have the fu!l brigade to
which his rank entitles him.
Rumors, of withdrawals -of troops from Cuba are said to be the probable basis
for the persistent statements that more soldiers have been ordered to China.
It is /admitted that, two regiments will soon be ordered to China. It is ad
mitted that two regiments will soon be ordered to the United States from Cuba,
the particular organizations being designated by General Wood, but they sim
ply will take the place in home garrisons of regulars which will go out to
Manila to relieve volunteer organizations there.
Major Simpson, chief of the bureau of Information of the War Department,
is engaged in the preparation of a map of China which will show with as great
particularity as possible that part of the empire in which the present trouble
is. being experienced. Immense difficulties are being 1 encountered In obtaining
accurate information with respect not only to the topojrraphy of the country, but
also as to : the telegraph and railway lines. Detailed and up-to-date informa
tion is scarcely to.be had, but In a short time a reasonably accurate map of the
country will be ready for the use of the . department officials and the troops
which may find China a field of operations.
Officials in the State and War departments to-day were Interested in the dis
patch received by Minister Wu from Peking, not only because of its contents,
but. especially because of the route by whiCjh it was transmitted. Wu said it
reached him from Peking by. way of Sinanfu. â¢ Slnan is the capital of the pro
vince of Shantung, southeast of Peking and northwest of Shanghai. Tha
word "fu," following the name of a city, indicates that it is the capital of a
province. The city is near the Hoarigho, one of the two great rivers of China.
Telegraphic communication between Peking and Slnan (or Tsinan. as it is show a
on the German maps) is almost direct; thence to Shanghai, the nearest cable
Btatlon; the route la roundabout. That Minister Wu's dispatch came from
Shanghai 13 almost certain, aa according to the best maps in the possession of
the department there are no cable stations north of Shanghai on the Chinese
coast. , .

message, dated Tientsin, Monday, June 25:
"The Russian general in command of the relief force had decided, in view of
Saturday's heavy flphtlng and marching, that one day's rest for the troops was
essential and that the advance should not be resumed until to-day. Meanwhile

Artillery replying. The guns of the allies were more skillfully handled and put
the guns of the Chinese out of action, one by one, the Chinese retreating about
noon.
There was keen rivalry among the representatives of the various nations as
to which would enter Tientsin first and the Americans and British went in neck
and neck. Tho Russians stormed the arsenal, thereby sustaining the largest
losses.
Several thousand Japanese have left Taku for Tientsin and altogether 13,000
Japanese have landed. The international troops now aggregate nearly 20,000 and

and to a declaration of war; but as China does nothing like other countries the
official opinion is that there is nothing to do but to await the course of events
and to see what the Ministers themselves say when they are rescued.
All the students at the foreign hospitals in Canton are leaving. Women
missionaries are returning from the West River ports. There was a slight dis
turbance at Wochou Tuesday while the women were embarking. The crowd
shouted. "Kill the foreign devils."
According to advices from Shanghai the Chinese officials, by direction of
the southern Viceroys, are asking the Consuls to agree to conditions "ensuring,"
as the Chinese say. "the neutrality of Shanghai and other coast cities."
They are also asking that foreign warships shall not sail or anchor near the
forts nor go to ports where there are no warships now; that their crews shall
not go ashore and that the protection cf foreigners be left to the Chinese
authorities. These conditions are considered at Shanghai to be virtually an ulti
matum from Viceroys Liv Kung Yih and Chang Chih Tung. The Consuls de-
Eire a sufficient naval and military force to back up their refusal to comply
with these demands. The total national force now there consists of 969 men
with thirty-two guns. The Chinese have COCO men with six guns in the forts
and 10.000 men outside Shanghai with modern rifles and machine guns.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 27.â Great-Is the com

not on the midway, but in a theater in
the town. She was the original to Ban

most of them will be strangers here,
though well known through their connec
tion with secret societies. Fifteen cash
prizes will be given for the "cutest," the
prettiest: and the fattest babies in both
sexep, and. they will be classified accord
ing to age.
At 11 o*clock this evening the throngs

JOURNEYED TO DAWSON
TO KILL HIS WIFE
John Legrace Travels Many Miles to
Commit Murder, but Only-
Wounds His Victim.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, June 27.â News was
received last night from Dawson of an
other tragedy. John Legrace, or, as he
was sometimes known. Tom Forrest, shot
and wounded his wife, from whom he had
been separated for some time, and shot
and killed himself. The victim of the
tragic occurrence, who had li>een living at
Dawson and before at Gldnora with a
man named Madden, was a resident of
this- city- two years ago. -The crime waa
premeditated. The would-be murderer
arrived at Dawson on a scow on June 6
and wrote a letter, which Is believed to
tell of- what he intended doing, addressed
to one Jones in the City of Mexico. He
went to the river steamer Ora, which was
preparing to leave Dawson, and gave the
letter to a passenger named Howey, who
promised to mail it on reaching "the out
side."
He left here about the end of May and
stayed aome time at Bennett. He met
S. ,K. Sherwood and Tver Brown, with
whom he went to Dawson. There he
gave his name as Tom Forrest. They
built a scow and reached Dawson with ft
three weeks ago. The day following Le
grace went to Sherwood and asked him
to go downtown with him to see a party.
Sherwood only walked as far as the post
office and he never saw Legrace alive
again.
Then it seems the Intending murderer
went to find his wife. Two hours later
revolver shots were heard from her cabin
in front of the Owl restaurant, and she
was soeen to run out with blood stream
ing fro-n her neck. In the cabin Le
grace wns found in a bed dying, with re
volver in hard and a bullet hole in his
head. He died during the night. She haa
recovered.

Pilar, Concepcion, Garcia and Alvarez,
were released here to-day upon taking the
oath of allegiance to the Government and
renouncing all forms of revolution In the
Philippines, together with making formal
acknowledgment of American sover
eignty.
This oath Is much* stronger and more
binding than the oath which General Otis
administered and was consequently dis
tasteful to the, Filipinos, wfeo accepted It
with bad* grace, fully realizing the results
of any violation.
Senor Buencamlno took the oath Mon
day. It is hoped that the sparing of the
nine leaders will influence their men to
take advantage of the armistice, which
has thus far been without results othe>
than those of to-day.

That American women are growing

any observer for argument. Slender-

best describe the typical girl of to-day.

all this in an improvement on the more
sturdy and buxom woman of two gen-

standpoint is a rapid degeneration. These
delicate creatures are easy to get sick.
hard to keep well and very difficult to
cure when sick.

Santa Cruz. The Republican State Con
vention will meet "In Santa Cruz, and of
course we regret that the Democrats can
not be with us. Santa Cruz is not sore.
Our Democrats will be Democrats still,
and at some other time we will ask that
our city be selected as the place for hold-

quois braves, headed by a brass band, will
escort the delegates representing Califor

ferry. The delegations will board the 10
a. m. boat, and upon arrival at the Oak-
land mole will take the overland limited
train of the Central Pacific for Ogden.
From Ogden to Colorado Springs the dele
pates will travel over the Rio Grands
Western and Denver and Rio Grande rail
roads. From Colorado Springs to Kansas
City the delegation will travel over the

that dining car service from Colorado
Springs to the Missouri River could not be
provided.
Stephen M. White, chairman of the dele-
gation, will leave Los Angeles to-day and
join his fellow delegates at Sacramento
to-morrow afternoon. Mr. White will sec

â¢been provided to enable the representa

DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION READY TO START FOR KANSAS CITY.
in room 12, eighth floor. Mills building.
On motion of Clitus Barbour a commit
tee of three was appointed to present
resolutions in respect to the memory of
the late Patrick Reddy. The chair named
as the committee: Chtus Barbour, M. P.
Tarpey and A. Camlnettl. Later In the
session appropriate resolutions were in
troduced by the committee and, on motion
of Charles Edelman, adopted by rising
vote. â¢
T. E. Treacy made a few remarks on
the subject of committees in general and
the State Central Committee in particu
lar. He apprehended that the committee
to govern the party s-'hould be appointed
by a convention emanating from the peo
ple. He moved that a committee be ap
pointed to report on the legality of the
State Central Committee recently chosen
at Sacramento. The motion was lost.
Talk of Ratification.
The subject of a Bryan ratification
meeting was Introduced by Chairman Seth
Mann, who Is a personal friend of the
orator from Nebraska.
Dr. Hill of Los Anseles moved that a
committee of five be appointed to ar
range: for a ratification meeting In San
Francisco.
T. E. Treacy wanted the county com
mittee of San Francisco to get 4nto har
ness.
M. J. Kerwin of Alameda replied* that
his people were willing to be run by the
State committee, but not by the San
Francisco committee. Tim Treacy did not
fancy the oratory or the demeanor of
Commltteeman Kerwin and expressed his
dissent by ironical allusions to the Dem
ocratic majorities rolled up in Alameda
County.
The trouble was finally adjusted by a
suggestion from Dr. Browning that the
ratification meeting in San Francl3co be
managed by the Joint committees. The
suggestion was put In the form of an
amendment and adopted.
W. I-L Alford, T. E. Treacy. James Den
man, J. C. McKlnstry and Oscar Hocka
were named to represent the State com
mittee. Later In the day Jasper McDon
ald, chairman of the Democratic County
Committee, appointed the following to
represent the locaj organization:

Bladder troubles rr.ost al-vays result from

the kidneys. If you are feeling badly you
can make no mistake by taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidr.ey, liver ar.d

It corrects inability to hold crfna and scald-
ing pain in passing it, ar.d overcomes that
unpleasant necessity of being competed to

times during the night. The mi!d and ths
extraordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. I; stands ths highest for its v/cn-
derful curss of the rr.ost distressing casss.

For a TTOoan to come to that period

Republicans Unable to Decide Upon
a Nominee for Governor.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., June 27.â The
Republican State Convention settled down
to business this afternoon and began bal
loting for Governor at 5:30 o'clock this
evening. At 10 o'clock to-night, It belngr
apparent that the convention was In a
deadlock, an adjournment was ordered
until 'to-morrow. Six delegates were
placed In. nomination, these being: Aaron
T. Bliss of Saginaw, Dexter M. Ferry of
Detroit, Justus S. Steams of Ludington,
Charles E. S. Osborne cf Sault Ste. itarie,
James O'Donnell of. Jackson and Mllo D.
Campbell of Coldwater. Ferry was In the
lead on the last balloti haSing 294 votes,
the number required to nominate being
421.
The committee on resolutions has com
pleted the platform, which will be pre
sented to-morrow. The platform com
mends the administration.* of 'President
McKinley; indorses the currency bill
passed by' Congress and the platform of
the Philadelphia convention: declares re
newed allegiance to the gold standard;
and expresses sympathy with' the. people
of the South African republics, hoping
that peace may be speedily secured. Upon
the question of trusts the platform says: Â¦
W> place our stamp of disapproval upon all
combinations of capital tending to restrict com
petition in business, to create monopoly, to
limit production or to control prices, and we.
favor legislation to. that end.

his paper, . the Conservative, to-morrow:
The Gold Democrats are to-day, as firm in
their convictions for honest money, as loyal In
their devotion to principle, as they were in
IS?6. If Mr. Bryan Is again the nominee of the
Democratic party they will use. with slight
variation, the words he uttered In 1596 at
Richmond: "We will not come back."
If in 1896 the gold standard was a conspiracy
against the human race. If -It was then so
vicious as to merit such denunciation, it is
equally deserving of condemnation in 1900. If
the words Mr. JJryan uttere'l in 1596, in por
traying the iniquities 6f this gold standard,
Â¦wpre the expression of an honest conviction, it
would be an act of Infamy for him to now
compromise with those whom he once charged
with conspiring to destroy our homes and fire
sides. The Gold Democrats will not support
one who would thus knowingly identify him
self with those whom he believes are seeking
the ruin of the country. If this was not the
language of soberness and truth, if he was
only playing the arts of the demagogues of ap
pealing to the prejudices and passions of the
peopte. he Is dishonest and unfit for the Presi
dency. If he 'was honest and sincere in 1896
but is now willlnff to acknowledge himself In
error, he is so lacking In Judgment and so defi
cient in reasoning powers as to be utterly in
competent to be the Chief Executive of the
great republic. The Gold Democrats of the
United States will not support Bryanarchy

We faoe with sorrow, rhaiaa and fear the
awful fart that this Honor traffic has a rriP
on our Government, municipal. State and na
tional, through the revenue system and sa
loon sovereignty, which no other party dares
to dispute: a grip which dominates the party
now in power from caucus to Congress, from
policeman to President, from the rum shop to
the White House; a rrip which compels the
Cfclef executive to consent that law Khali be
nulllflr-d in b<>lialf of the brewer, that the
canteen sha" cunÂ»e our army and spread in
temperance across the seas, and that our
nag: shall wave as the symbol of partnership

Chrirti&n sentiment and patriotism almost un

inSu^nces never before aeÂ«o In this country,
that by his conspicuous example as a wine

We deplore the fact that an admtnlitra

power to carry our fla* acroen the Beao and to

its lac* of power to prohibit the American sa

and unchrlrtlanlty of this act upon the admin

We call attention to the fearful fact that
exportation of liquors from the United States
to the Philippines increased from $537 In ISSB
to J45T.198 in the firrt ten months of the fiscal
year ending June 1, 1S0O; and that while our
exportation of liquors to Cuba never reached
J3o,<ym a year previous to American occupation
of tha"t Island, our exports of such liquors to
Cuba during the flsca! year of ISI-9 reached the
sum of $629, 6C5.
The platform was received with the
wildest enthusiasm. Every sentence in
condemnation of President UcKinley was
greeted with shouts of applause and ap
proval, and cries of "Hit him again!" the
delegates standing on their chairs and
yelling.
"I have another resolution recommend
ed by the committee on resolutions," said
Professor Hopkins. He then read the fol
lowing-:
Resolved, Ttiat it Is the sense of this conven
tion that the light of ballot shall not be denied
any citizen on account of ccx. .
Declares for Equal Suffrage.
It was evident .that leaving the woman
suffrage plank out of the platform was
distasteful to many delegates, and when
Mrs. Beauchamp, resident of the Wo
men's Christian Temperance Union of
Kentucky, took the platform to advocate
an equal suffrage plank., she was wildly
applauded. A picture of Frances E. Wll
lard which hung 0% - er the speaker's stand
had fallen down during the afternoon re
cess. It had not heen replaced. Mrs.
Beauchamp referred . to its "removal,"
and in an instant a very respectable row
was on.
"I protest arainst such shameful insln.
uatlons; it fell down!" yelled one excited
male delegate.
"Put It up again!" shouted another.
It waÂ« hung up behind the speaker's
desk, but this did not satisfy the dele
pates, and the hall did not become quiet
until the portrait had been hung from
the gallery. After considerable discus
sion, a rising vote was called for and the
f>latform and additional resolution favor
ng woman suffrage adopted by a prac
tically unanimous vote and amid a temp,
est of cheers.

SANTA ANA. June 27. â A remarkable
fasting record is that of Mrs. Mary
BÂ«canon of 712 East First street,
this city, which surpasses that of
Dr. Tanner of New York by seven
days, or a total of forty-seven days.
It was not for notoriety that Mrs. Be
canon entered upon the fast which ex.
ceeded by some days her 'expectations.
For three years she had suffered from
stomach trouble. One day while chatting
with a number of friends she mentioned
her trouble, and one of the party sug
gested that she refrain from food for a
time. She consulted her physician and he
fell In with the suggestion, giving his
consent without hesitation.
Mrs. Becanon made preparation in ac
cordance with the suggestion, and on the
second day of May enfred upon what
she expected to b*> a ten or fifteen dayn'
fast. But when ten days had come and
gone she was feeling po much better than
she had felt for many months that she
decided to prolong her fasting period.
Ten days more passed "away, and still
she felt no need of nourishment, and she
fasted on until at the close of the forty
seventh day she felt she must take some
nourishment, although she did not crave
It at all.
She dared not force solid food upon her
stomach after Its long rest, and the first
thing to pass her lips was tomato juice,
and only a cupful of this.
During her longr abstinence from food
she drank from three to four cupfiils of
hot water each day. She exercised dail>,
always dre??ingr and undressing herself.
Her little daughter was sick with typhoid
fever for a short time while her fast was
on and she gave the little one considera
ble of her attention, although a rrurse
was in the house all the time to look
after the little one and attend to thÂ«
wants of the mother.
The most remarkable part of the fast
was that the first two weeks Mrs. Be>
canon grew a little weak, after whicn
time she took the opposite course and
prcw stronger. On the forty-third I da>
sho declared that she felt stronger than
she did at the time she entered upon her
remarkable fnst.
The lady is but 37 years of age. She
was a hta\Â»y womanâ lB3 poundsâ and ap
poarpd to -have an almost unlimited ca
pacity for self-support. After all this time
the body has decreased in weight fifty
pounds. Her stomach has been so weak
ened by its long inactivity that it has
hardly retained anything since two dayh
after the fast was broken. Clam soup ana
other liquid nourishment were given her
on the two days following the day on
which she interrupted her fast by par
taking of tomato juice, all of which were
retained. But her stomach now rebels
against anything in the line of food anft
the result may prove that the fast was
a fatal mistake. However, her- physician
and family firmly believe that she will be
all right in a few days, and that the
troublesome stomach will resume its nor
mal condition and perform its duties with
regularity.

MURDEROUSLY ASSAULTED
BY DISCHARGED EMPLOYE
H. C. Hclmaxi, a Stockton Capitalist,
Shot Down in the Office
of His Hotel.
Sp-cial Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. June- 27.â 11. C. Holman.
one of the most prominent citizens of this
place, was murderously assaulted this
evening in the office cf his hotel by a man
known as Charles Marsh. The desperate
man f.rrd two phots at the aged capital
ist, one ball entering at the side of the
nose, ranging downward and coming out
at the back of the neck.
Marsh, who was formerly employed as a
waitpr, was recently discharged and ac
cused of dishonesty. This evening Hol
man was sitting in his office reading a
paper when Marsh entered and, after a
lew angry words, drew a revolver and
opened hre.
The first shot was fired so close that
the hotel man was burned. He fell behind
the counter and thus escaped the second
shot. The wound is serious. It is re
parded as remarkable that the ball passed
the arteries and vital parts. Owing to the
advanced .age of Mr. Holman fears are
entertained for his recovery, although the
physicians are very hopeful. Marsh was
promptly arrested. The victim of his fury
is a capitalist and the owner of the United

brate Their Golden Jubilee
"With Their Friends.
A delightful and Interesting function
drew hosts of friends to the home of the
Rev. Dr. and Mrs. James H. Warren last
night. It was the gulden wedding of Dr.
Warren, who Is known as Bishop War

ica. In 1850 Dr. and Mrs. Warren were
married In* Galesburg t 111. Immediately
afterward they came to San Francisco
in answer to a call sent the j-oung miiÂ»
lster. then Just ordained, to take' charge
of the first Congregational church con
secrated In San Francisco. Since thai
time Dr. Warren has founded no' less
than 180 places of Congregational worship
in California.
Last night, while friends thronged
around him and his bride of fifty years
In a room decorated In amber tones, let
ters and telegrams poured in and were
read from clergy in almost every State.
Although 81 years old, Dr. .Warren Is
still active in philanthropic works, and
the seventy-three summers Mrs. Warren
has seen have rendered her a no less ef
ficient helper In charity than she was half
a century ago.

REPORTS ABOUT
JUBILEE FUNDS
JiXffi I*S. LILLIAN ROSS, or Lucy
I )(\ Acevedo Â« as sne now calls herself,
II M>\ has aÃalna B al n been telling fairy
tales to Captain of Detectives
Seymour and that official has about come
to the conclusion that she does not know
the truth. She says now that she never
had a husband, but that David Wasser
man, the son of a prominent dry poods
merchant of Sacramento, is the father of
her first child, and Louis yon Figllo a
barber of the same city. Is the father' of
the second child.
The Sacramento police discredit the
whole story. They telephoned to Captain
Seymour last night that they have been
unable to find any such person as Yon
Figllo and they believe that no such man
ever was In Sacramento. David Wasser
man emphatically denies the story of his
alleged Intimacy with the woman. He ad
mits having met her at a dance in Sacra
mento about three years ago, but says
that he never became intimately acquaint
ed with her. Attorneys Seymour &
White of Sacramento, who are claimed bÂ»
Mrs. Ross to have Interviewed her on be>
half of Wasserman after the birth of. her
first child, absolutely deny the whole
Etory.
Captain Seymour is still working on the
theory that Mrs. Ross -was a party'to the
robbery and attempted burning of the Ce
derberg flat, at 3539 Twenty-fourth street
on last Sunday night. He is still after the
man who was the last "husband" of Lucy
Acevedo, alias Mrs. Lillian Ross. He be
lieves that this person, if he can be found
can shed some light on the mystery. The
people who have been neighbors of the
Acevedo family during the past few
months say that they have never seen
Mrs. Ross, as they knew her, with any
man, except on one occasion, about three
weeks ago, when she went downtown with
a strange* who called at the house, and
afterward stated that the caller was her
"friend."
Detectives Byram and Wren give the
Acevedo family a very bad name as the
result of three days' Investigation in the
vicinity of their home. They say that
the family lives In* a mysterious way and
that they are known as petty thieves.
Chief of Police Sullivan of Sacramento
saya that Lucy bore a very bad reputa
tion before she left that city.
Although the Acevedos claim to be very
poor and on the verge of starvation, they
had a Jolly party In their house, 817 Va
llejo street, on Tuesday night, to which
several of their Spanish friends were in
vited. There was plenty to eat and drink
and they kept up the fun for several
hours.
Captain Seymour has secured the state
ments of two men who will be important
witnesses If the matter ever gets into the
courts. One is L. A. Eaton, a watchman
for the telephone company, who was closo
by when the fire started In the Cederberg
flat, and who put out the blaze. He was
watching a lot of stuff In the street, al
most In front of the door and must have
seen anybody who entered or left the
place by the front way: but he did not
see any stranger there that night.
Joseph Corrlgan, 1803 Folsom street, who
first discovered the fire, has told Captain
Seymour that when he ran up to the door
he found it partially ajar, but in the ex
citement Mrs. Whltehouse pulled It shut
and the spring. lock caught He did not
hear any one crying for help at that time.

On motion of Grand Marshal Costello

through and in a terrific drive won by a

Chief Sullivan of the San Francisco
Fire Department has submitted the fol

Fire Department Headquarters.
SAX FRANCISCO. Cal. June 27, 1900.
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: On behalf of
the San Francisco Fire Department I beg
to ask for the use of your valuable columns
to ask the Indulgence of the general public
of this city, -who have co nobly responded
In the matter of purchasing tickets for the
btnefit j>erformBnce to be given on Friday
afternoon at the Grand Opera-house for the
widow and orphans of our gallant comrade,
John Edward Sweeney, who lost his life in
th* dii>charre of his duty.
The Associated Theatrical Managers of
Fan Francisco nobly came to the front and
tf-ndered this benefit In the cause of those
left helpl^s and alone. But four thousand
tickets were issued by the managers, suf
ficient to cover the capacity of the Grand
Opera-house.
The men of my department, to the num
ber of five hundred or more, simply be-
Fieged me for tickets, not that they wished
to force them upon the public, but because
the public was clamorous for tickets to
help tbe *ood cause alone.
la l**ffÂ«> than three days nearly eight thou
sand tickets were sold, with the result that
after the capacity of the reserved seats of
the Grand Opera-house had been exhausted,
when tickets were exchanged, the holders of
the balance of the tickets found that they
could not obtain reserved seats.
It Is this situation that prompts me, on
behalf of the Fire Department, to ask thÂ«
Indulgence of the public.
We ask those who have bought tickets and
who have been unable to secure reserved
Feats to remember that there Is a sorrow-
Ing widow and four little children whose
wit existence deoends unon this fund.
READY TO RING UP CURTAIN
FOR SWEENEY ENTERTAINMENT
Chief Sullivan Explains the Fire De
partment's Overflow Ticket
Sale. 'I
Surely no one who has bought a ticket
and who will be unable to secure a reserved
Beat will feel achieved at this fact.
I know and every one in San Francisco
knows that even* person who purchased a
ticket did so with the one Idea, namely, to
help the pood cause, to honor the brave dead
and assist, the helpless.
The firemen of San Francisco therefore
ask the public not to feel that they have
$632 55. which makes the grand total up
till to-day $6641 85.

REPUBLICAN ENROLLMENTS.
IHJ ROM reports that have been received from the
various Assembly districts in the city it is evi
dent the enrollment of members of Republican
clubs will be very large. That in itself is an encourag
ing sign. It shows that the rank and file of the p*arty
are taking an active interest in political affairs at this
early stage of the campaign and gives promise of an
organization that will do effective work in the contest
for prosperity. .
The most satisfactory feature of the situation thus
far is the activity which jhas been displayed by^ the
business men and the workingmen of the party in the
formation of the clubs. ;. Quite a number of influential
men have made something like an elaborate canvass
to rouse the better element of the party into activity!
Such efforts are in the highest degree commendable!
The bosses and the would-bft bosses will be -sure to
enroll all the multitude of hoafers and bums they can
get admitted to the rolls and will make use of every
resource at their command to capture as many of
the clubs as they can. The only ; way to guard against
them is by enrolling such a force of decent Republi
cans in every district as will secure for the better ele
ment the control of the club machinery. To achieve
that is now the duty of all loyal Republicans.
It is to be borne in mind that the bosses and their
gangs will^not make a fight if they, see that the better
class, of Republicans are to be arrayed against them
with a : determination to win. Ample experience has
convinced the professional politician and job-hunter
that when, the rank" and file of the party is aroused the
best thing for them to do is to keep Â¦quiet. A' big en
rollment in every district will therefore mean not only
victory, but an easy victory. For the rest of the week
the enrollment's to go on and the canvass for mem
bers among the business men . and* the . working-men
should be kept up with vigor until the end.
INCREASE OF CANCER.
The Cell does not hold itself responsible for
the opinions published in this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may
have as communications of general interest-
Editor The Call: Your editorial article
in The Call of June 23 on "Increase of
Cancer" is timely and is very creditable
to your Journal.
The causes of cancer should also be
dwelt upon In your valuable paper. They
are in the majority of cases plainly and
simply the jcurse -of "grafting in" dis
eases through vaccination.
You must note the remarkable coinci
dence that those nations named by you as
immune from cancer are the very ones
â¢which are free from vaccination. Com
pulsoryl vaccination canfcot be enforced
in those countries, and hence- the "In
crease of cancer among civilized peoples"
upholding. compulsory vaccination is per
fectly natural and not at all "strangp "
A necessary consequence of this inocul
ation of the various kinds of virus -nto
the human system is the promotion of
virulent diseases. , such Â¦ as cancer
phthisis, diphtheria, leprosy, etc., all of
which are more destructive than small
pox. Thus, while "civilization may breed
more diseases than barbarism." and while
it has the "advantage of knowing better "
It does not profit by that .knowledge â¢ for
through vaccination it promulgates by
grafting into instead of eradicating and
driving out diseases from the human sys
tem. I). ALBERT HILLER, M.D.

THE BOERS AS GUERRILLAS.
WHEN Pretoria was captured the British had
bright expectations of a speedy end of the
war; but Botha avoided a combat. He was not
going to be caught in^ trap like Cronje. Despite all
that Roberts could do the wily Boers kept at a safe
distance from his main force, but operated with such
vigor on his flanks and rear that the Field Marshal
was compelled to report a good many "unfortunate
occurrences" in which detachments of his troops were
beaten and a considerable number of prisoners taken.
Then Buller made his way through the mountain
passes and got into touch with Roberts. Straight
way there, was spread out what the British dispatches
called "a wide-flung net"' to capture Botha, but that
in turn has failed. Late reports are to the effect' that
Botha has divided his force into small commandos
and that some have slipped out of the net, some have
forced their way out, and others are hacking the net
to pieces here and there.
In this condition of affairs the British are getting
a good deal of practice in a kind of war that may be
useful to them. That, at any rate, is the view the
London Chronicle takes of the situation, for in a
recent editorial on the subject it said: ''All these
alarums and excursions in the Orange River Colony
show that the Boer Intelligence Department has not
lost its old superiority; but we still cherish the .hope
that" by dint of training Lord Roberts' subordinates
will acquire the art of not being taken unawares. Jf
the war were to drag on for several years they might
even become clever enough to surprise a Boer com
mando."
It is regarded as an axiom of war that guerrilla
tactics can never win against a well organized army.
It is impossible for small bands of men lacking heavy
artillery to capture forts or important posts. All
they can do is to make trouble; and, unfortunately for
the Boers, they can hardly make as much trouble for
the British as for themselves. If their country were
populated wholly by people of their own race they
might hope to wear put the invading force, but the
larger part of the population is made up of blacks,
arid if a long continued guerrilla war should produce
a widespread lawlessness in the country the Boer
families far removed from the towns would be likely
to suffer heavily from depredations of wandering
bands of robbers. In the end, therefore, unless some
thing utterly unforeseen happens, Botha's < forces
must -surrender, and all that he can hope.for.in-.con
tinuing the struggle is to make terms that will "save
something to his countrymen when the final surren
der comes.
In the meantime if the British officers learn. enough
from the contest to be able to keep out of traps and
to surprise a Boer commando, as the Chronicle sug
gests, they may derive something of benefit from the

MIDWEEK-NOTES
OF THE THEATERS
THEY CONFERRED
COLONEL BRYAN has been giving himself a
vocal vacation. Incidentally he has sojourned
at a resort in Wisconsin. His rest being over,
he descended again to the haunts of men and called
W. R. Hearst into conference to find out how the
public pulse beats and what he must do to be saved.
The conference is represented to have been long, and
as long conferences are anxious always, this one must
have been no exception. Whether it invoked the
nomination of Mr. Hearst to the Vice Presidency, and
the price he was willing to pay therefor, in competi
tion with the other millionaire candidates who think
of bidding, or the amount he was willing to give for
the use of the party for advertising purposes, is- not
Imitating the example of the Sacramento conven- 1
tion. it is probable that the party will sell the adver
tising privilege to Mr. Hearst. It has come to this
complexion at last, tinder the leadership of Bryan,
that the Democratic party is rented for advertising
purposes, like the flap of a circus tent or the drop
curtain of a vaudeville theater.
Colonel Bryan is something of an advertiser him
self, and has used the party in his business to such
profitable purpose that he leads the list of taxpayers
on moneys, credits and personalty in the town of
Lincoln. As he has monopolized this privilege he is
in a position to make Mr. Hearst come down liberally
for a division of it. As for the poor old drop cur
tain, it has nothing to say. We insist, however, that
it is a contemptible thing to do to a poor old party
that has seen better days. It is like making Grant's
warhorse pull a scavenger's cart, or compelling
Dewey to sell shoestrings and suspenders. It is evi
dent that the conference was to consider this partition
of the season's privileges, for the two Billies surely
could not have met to arrange a sorfV)f college yell
for the party in the campaign, since Mr. Hearst has
been yelling "Kail up the flag!" and Oratoricalbilly
has yelled "Pull the flag down!"
The campaign yell they would arrange out of their
past records and utterances would have to run this
Nail. nail, nail.
Nail the flap to the Philippines.
Damn, damn, damn, |
Damn the constitution.
Pull. pull, pull.
Pull down the flag.
Rah for the constitution.
That they get together at all "to confer" is evi
dence of the straits of the part}' or that it has lost
not only the confidence of the country but its own
self-respect. The pretense that two such men have
the decision of the destinies of a party is one proof
that its character and brains are on vacation.
THE EXPECTED IN CHINA.
THE present situation in China destroys one illu
sion about those people. The ignorant in other
nations have assumed that the Chinese were in
capable of resisting any attack or resenting any in
sult offered to their national ' spirit. \ This idea was
greatly nourished by the Chino-Japan war. In that
brief struggle a nation of forty millions seemed to
have easily overcome one. of four hundred millions.
The tendency of the Western nations to help them
selves in China t was greatly promoted by that result.
Germany and Russia hurried in with carvers in hand,
and the others followed. Even Spain, the, victim of
her old lust for ownershipof the earth, indicated her
desire for a piece of the meat. Men who had made
a study of the Chinese character did not entertain the
idea of the passiveness or cowardice of the people
which was held by the bullying nations. Such men
expected what has happened.
The Chinese have proved to be like other people.
They are attached to their own institutions, love their
own ways, prefer their own form of the religious
idea, and, the population being dense, object to being
further crowded by an invasion of foreigners. When
they show these characteristics, common to all hu
manity, the world jumps on them as if they were ab
normal, degenerate and without any rights deserving
of respect. Other nations have rushed troops in; and
we must needs join the invasion- Already the Ameri
can jingo is jingoing and asserts that as we are a
world power we must spill the blood of American
soldiers and spend the substance of American tax
payers, because China has done to foreigners on her
soil exactly what we do to Chinese here.
This joining the invaders is a proceeding that needs
close watching. American jingo politicians are pro
fuse in their professions that' it is for the purpose of
protecting American missionaries, and preserving
the open door in China for the sake of trade.
We do not say that this is reprehensible. Unfortu
nately the missionary, instead of bearing good tidings
of great joy, peace on earth and good will toward
men, has become the forerunner of bad tidings, of
aggression, war on earth and ill will toward men.
Their conduct in China has been that of men
bound on a political rather than a spiritual mission.
Senator Lodge sounds the call to arms against Rus
sia, and casts a cloud oi suspicion upon her motives
in China. Independent men all over the world 'will
respect Russia for one .thing. She has not sent her
missionaries ahead under pretense of saving the souls
of the people to stir up strife, provoke violence and
use their own acts as a pretext for calling on their
Government. Russia has entered Korea and Man
churia not pretending that she is thers for anything
but political purposes. She is seeking in 'Asia' what
the jealous nations have denied to her in Europe, an
unfrozen seaport as a basis for her commerce and her
navy. Southern Europe united in opposing and de
feating Bonaparte and destroying his. empire, and
ever since has been attempting to carry out his policy
toward : Russia, which was to hem her in and prevent
her use of a navy by keeping her confined to waters
that are frozen for many months in the year.
Senator Lodge chooses to utter the cry of that
Europe against Russia, and to see the need of our
armed and bristling presence in China to aid in
thwarting the Muscovite. But let us watch our
selves. We have seen, in the case of the Spanish
war, how an apparently simple action, undertaken for
a definite purpose and right in itself, drifts into a
maze of complications, until, the cry of duty, destiny
and divine Providence being raised, we plunge head
long upon a course of which no man can see the end,
and in which but few see any benefit.
We are in China now to protect American interests.
Let us beware that we do not repeat the willful acts
done in Samoa, when we went around shelling palm
roofed villages in the wake of a British admiral who
began the sport because he said "it was so d -d
dull."
â¢ Perhaps life on a far naval station may get dull,
but our people do not desire to pay the cost of war
and causeless aggression just to cure naval officers of
ennui. .
Another invasion of our rights is being planned by
the Board of Education. .This enterprising body has
expressed an intention to create organized agencies
for the spread of 'dyspepsia by establishing cooking
classes for thegirl pupils in the schools." ;\ .

THE QUIGG CONTROVERSY.
GENERAL GROSVENOR has begun a rather
" unseemly, controversy with Mr. Quigg of
New York in regard to alleged changes made
in the Republican platform between the time it left
the committee and'- was reported to the convention.
The first alleged change was in the plank referring to
the Philippines. It would appear that Grosvenor
sawed out this plank all by himself, and had fashioned
it to fit some of the speeches he had made in Con
gress. It was declaratory of the power of Congress
over the territory that has fallen to us as a temporary
affliction or an evil legacy from the. Spanish, war.
The General says that this was all promised a place
in the platform. But in the judgment of the com
mittee it was an essay, long drawn out and going far
beyond the statement of a fundamental principle into
argument and illustration. It resembled one of the
old-fashioned half-page editorials that Sam Medary
used to write in his Columbus newspaper when
Grosvenor was a boy; and which were read in sec
tions by the Buckeye patrons of Sam's intellectual
grist mill. The'-committee, aware that the subject
treated in this essay on government is now before the
Supreme Court, which may reach a decision in Oc
tober, did not care to pronounce a political judg
ment on a matter that is undergoing judicial exami
nation. The reason for this' abstention should be ap
parent to General Grosvenor. If the court agreed
with such platform declaration it would be accused oi
submitting to partisan influence and of warping its
judgment to suit partisan interests. If it decided ad
versely to General Grosvenor's essay, the party would
be left the lurch with a dead issue on its hands and
a "doted" plank in its platform. So, although Mr.
Quigg has shown conclusively that there was no
change made in the platform after it left the commit
tee, and that Grosvenor's essay was canceled by the
full body, even if it had been otherwise and Quigg
had amended it out he would be entitled to the grati
tude of the party.
It is highly probable that the constitutional theory
set forth in the rejected/plank is true. If it is, the.in
sertion of an essay on the subject would not make it
any more true, and rt false all the fine writing of
which General Grosvenor is capable could not make
it true. Therefore the country will highly appreciate
General Grosvenor's subsidence, silence- and future
quiet on this subject.
When he opened controversy about the platform he
seems to have unlocked the accusative ability of
others and turned it all loose on poor Quigg. The
canal plank refers to the construction of an "isthmian
canal." As that work has commonly been referred to
as the Nicaragua canal a Chicago newspaper smelled
a rat in the word "isthmian." and as Quigg was al
ready pilloried by Grosvenor as a professional and
expert rearranger of the ground plan, front elevation
and architectural style of platforms, he was charged
with changing the canal. Quigg proved to be the
worm that turns, and he turned with a libel suit in his
fist and smote that newspaper therewith, from per
fecting press to sheep's foot. . Â¦ :
Upon examination there appears no more reason
for calling the canal Nicaragua than Costa Rica, for
it traverses both countries. Again, a commission or
dered by Congress is making an examination of all
routes for an isthmian canal, and if it should find a
better and cheaper one to construct, why gash the
faces of Nicaragua and Costa Rica at all?
Finally, another gentleman declares that he induced
the change from Nicaragua to isthmian, and that
Quigg had nothing to do with it. Let us hope that
this ends the episode on which Mr, Quigg rose to
the eminence of a national issue as a proof-reader of
the platform who changed it to suit his own ideas.
In its important pails the document is of such ex
cellence that if General Grosvenor and the Chicago
newspaper can prove that he wrote it all his future
career is assured, for wherever a platform has to be
made there will be calls for Quigg.

"There are 2000 children in the district
In which the LÂ© Conte is located who do
not attend school." said Mr. Webster,
"and 1 deem its maintenance imperative."
Chairman Mark explained tnat other
schools would take care of any pupils
that could not be accommodated in the
schools in the vicinity.
Webster believes tnat the abolishment
of the Le Conte has been accomplished in
order to help out the model scnool con
nected with the State Normal School, of
which L>r. Burk is president. Three hun
dred and fifty pupils will be forced to
other schools in the vicinity of Powell and
Washington streets.
The salary of the principals of primary
schools between six and thirteen classes
was tixed at $125 per month, and of princi
pals of primary, schools between four
teen and fifteen classes at $135 pec^month,
to take effect July 1.
Thi3 reduces the pay of principals of
twelve or thirteen classes irom $135 to
$125. W. W. Stone of the Burnett and C.
M. Johnston of the Pairmount School Â¦will
be cut from $150 to $125 each.
.The. sum of $2000 was set aside out of
the revenue of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1900, for the purpose of purchas
ing supplementary books. The Superin
tendent, in accordance with the provisions
of the charter, was authorized to recom
mend a list of supplementary books and
report the same at the meeting of tho
board J"uly 5, 1900. The sum of J2OOO was
set aside out of the revenue of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1900, for the purpose
of purchasing books for indigents*
The Directors took a slap at the" Board
of Examiners, who are questioning the
right of certain, special pedagogues to
teach under credentials not recognized
by the State, by restoring the salary of
Miss K. Ball, special teacher of drawing,
to $125 per month.
The following communication from the
San Francisco Ladies' Educational Soci
ety regarding the abolishing of the ninth
grade was taken under advisement:
Through the press it has come to us that you
intend abolishing the ninth year grammar
grade. This is very discouraging news to us
and 'will result In depriving the maximum of
our boys arÂ»a srfrls of a year's education. The
great majority aim at completing the grammar
course while only a small minority enter the
high schools. This cutting short the grammar
course one year is simply giving preference to
the wealthy class, as they can continue in the
high school. Hence this action will tend very
decidedly to lower the standard of our work
ing class and we will be taking a step backward
in this progressive age:
The salary of H. Armer, messenger and
janitor of the Board of Education, was
fixed at $S5 per month from July 1, 1900.
The funds of the School Department not
warranting the setting aside of three
flfths of the absence money to be placed

and to the commercial department of Lin
coln Grammar School.
The resolution authorizing the forma

These chamber clocks were generally
hung upon the' wall, and some had the

About 1600 efforts were made to adapt
these expensive, highly decorated time
keepers to domestic use. About the mid
dle of the century pendulums were intro
duced, and the newly invented chamber
clocks were in such demand that the sun
dial makers gave up their vocation .and
turned their attention to the making and
improvement of clocks. As with the
clock-watches, so with the chamber
clocks was great effort made to enjoin
upon the observer the generally over
looked fact that "every hour Is a step
toward death." One of the most unique
of these memento mori timekeepers was
the great chamber clock of 1623. Upon
one side door was engraved the conven
tional figure of Time with his sickle, and
upon the other was a ghastly skeleton
holding a torch, from which depended
the warning. "The Ming of death Is sin,'*

Judge Hebbard Dissolves Injunction
and Treasurer May Now Pay
City's Creditors.
St. Mary's Park fund. Judge Hebbard
has decided, was a fund that existed alono
in the minds of the local legislative body
and was never by official act designated
as such, nor was any fund set apart for
the purchase of the lands In question.
This decision places the $125,000 In the gen
eral fund and hence it may be used for
general purposes. The decision was
reached In the suit of Christian Rei?,
against Treasurer Brooks, in which plain
tiff sought an injunction restraining ths
use of the $125,000 in question f or purposes
other than the purchase of properties for
St. Mary's sauare. in his opinion Judga
Hebbard says:
In accordance with the- State law, on Septem
ber 18, 1599, the Board of Supervisors levied %
tax for city and county purposes for the fiscal
year endincr June 30, 1900, in tha sum of (1.023
on each $100 of valuation. Nowhere In the aiÂ»
portionment of funds was St. Mary's square
mentioned. Counsel for the plaintiff 'claims,
however, that the Board of Supervisors "In
tended" to set apart the sum of $123,000 as a
St. Mary* square fund and that therefore thÂ»
sum ought to remain in the treasury for that
purpose.
It Is quite evident by resolutions of tha
board, both before and after the passage oÂ£
Order No. 218, that this appropriation was in
tended, buf the laves relating to taxation have
not yet become sufficiently flexible to permit
the taking of any sum of money out of a fund
distinctly_mentlcned in an order fixing: a tax
levy and putting it Into a fund which exists
and existed at the time of the levy only In ths
minds of the members of the board which
passed the order. -
The demurrer to the complaint for these rea
sons is sustained without leave to amend and
thÂ« action is dissolved. The Injunction Is dis
solved and the defendant shall have judgment
for bis costs.
Although a few points -were Involved in
this case that were not passed upon by
Judge Sea well, this decision is practically
an affirmation of tbe first that was hand
ed down In the St. Mary'a Park case.

Attorney Rose Makes a Plippant
Answer to Judge Fritz and
Regrets It.
Attorney George M. Rose ran up against
Judge Frita yesterday and was ordered^
into custody for contempt of court. Later
he apologized to the Judge both In writing
and verbally, and the Judge purged him
of the contempt.
The case of Walter Recce, a colored
man, charged with failure to provide, was
called. Recce had eloped from Stockton
with the ex-wife of Charley Turner, the
pugilist, deserting his wife and children.
Rose insisted on representing Recce, al
though Recce declared he did not want
him. Rose then claimed he was in the
case as amicus curiae. He wa? cautioned
by the Judge to stop talking and when he
gave a. flippant answer he was ordered
into custody.
Recce's wife and mother-in-law were in
court and he promised to return home
with them. On that showing the case
was- dismissed. Mrs. Turner has a charge
of vagrancy against her and it will be
heard to-day.
SENT TO PRISON FOR
CONTEMPT OF COURT
Judge Murasky Appoints Her Special
Administratrix of Her Deceased
Husband's Estate.
Judge Murasky made an order yesterday
granting Mrs. Sadie Rosenbaum special
letters of administration upon the estate
of her late husband, Kmil D. Rosenbaum.
whose suicide, a few weeks ago was the
subject of much comment. Decedent's
estate is valued at $200,000. Mrs. Rosen
baum made application for a family al
lowance in the sum of $1000 a month, but
Judge Murasky held that $600 a month
was sufficient and awarded Mrs. Rosen
baum this amount.
Â¦When the case was called for hearing
Mrs. Rosenbaum. robed in somber garb,
took the stand. She testified that her late
husband's estate was not worth less than
$250,000. She said that $1000 a month as a
family allowance pending the probate pro
ceedings was not too great and asked for
this amount, with the result stated.
It is believed that the contest to Rosen
baum's will will be filed this week. The
petition asking 1 for the probate of the will
is set for hearing on Tuesday next. This
will be opposed by other relatives of the
deceased, who are anxious to obtain half
of his estate. It 13 understood that they
will allege that Rosenbaum was insane
when he marie his wife his sole devisee.
This will be decided at the hearing of the
contest. ,
ONE POINT GAINED BY
MRS. SADIE ROSENBAUM
eighteenth century revolving dials with
the single indicator are still to be found
in the South Kensington Museum. One
of the most pleasing represents a large
globe upheld by three beautiful bronze
boys. A serpent with head erect points
with his tongue to the time indicated upon
the revolving equatorial bands, one of
which chronicles the hour, another the
mlnutas.
The porcelain vase clock, said to have
belonged to Marie Antoinette, carries out
the same idea, the tongue of the serpent
coiled at the base of the urn forming the
fixed indicator of the revolving hours
upon the polygonal encircling bands.
It is difficult to ascertain just when the
pocket watches came into vogue. That
they were used in Shakespeare's day is
shown in "As You Like It," when Jaquea
says: "And then he drew a dial from his
poke." Long afterward, however, watches
were still made with a pointed projection,
which would clearly demonstrate their
unfitness for pocket use. A plausible
theory has been advanced to the effect
that fob watches' (from the German
"fuppe," a pocket) were Introduced by
the Puritans, whose aversion to undue
display led them to conceal their time
keepers about their clothing. Certain, it.
is that Oliver Cromwell's fob watch in
the British Museum is the first small
timekeeper found with fob chain appen
dant.
While the Puritans were doing: all they
could to repress ostentation and orna
ment in England, the clockmakers of Hol
land, Germany and France were vying
with one another in the production of ex
travagant ingenuities. Then were invent
ed the salt cellar clocks for state ban
quets, musical clocks which played a."
great variety of popular airs, tortoise
shell or egK-shaped watches suspended
from the chatelaine, walking stick* with
horologium in the knob for the Bishop
of Kly. mystery clocks with falling ball
attachments, perpetual motion clocks,
self-winding clocks, watches with pendu
lums, butterfly, acorn, sea shell, trumpet
shaped and flower watches, all exquisitely
enameled and frequently used to orna
ment hand mirror, fan or bracelet.
One of the most curious of the mystery
clorks vras Grollier de Servlere's mag
netic timekeeper fashioned In the form
of a shallow bowl whereon were marked
the numerals. When the bowl was filled
with water a tortoise made 6t cork was
placed therein, floating around until It
pointed to the time, and crawling from
one hour figure to another as the day
advanced. His chronological bump was
to protect the works from the dust, white
the weights and pendulum hung free.
By the close of the reign of Charles II
these clocks had become entirely inelosea
in wood, and were thus evolved into the
long-case eight-day timepieces popularly
known as grandfather clocks. The Intro
duction of the minute hand was slowly
accepted by country makers, and these
handsome clocks reached their perfection
in the days of Chippendale, the noted
cabinet maker of St. Martin's lane. His
foreman. Sheraton, distinguished for hts
ornate style and beautiful inlaid work,
also published a cabinet dictionary In
1808, from which popular clock cases have
been selected.
Somo of the older long-case clocks were
frequently embellished with Oriental lac
quer work or covered with marqueterle in
fine geometrical designs. The taste for
effective marqueterie became especially
pronounced in the time of William of
Orange, who brought in his train a band
of Dutch inlayer3.
Other beautiful variations of the clocks
of the Chippendale period were the darlc
oak cases carved in nigh relief. Although,
some specimens of this handsome worlc
have appeared at other periods, they all
seem to have been the result of artistic
experiment by enthusiastic woodcarvers.
designed to reinclose existing clocks
rather than especially planned receptacles
for new timekeepers.
It Is melancholy to think that the Intro
duction fifty years ago of cheap machine
made American clocks proved so disas
trous to the manufacture of old English
timepieces that thousand's of these ions
case clocks were cut up for firewood andY
their brazen interiors relegated to the
melting pot.
The norological industry has from time
to time been paralyzed by the Imposition
of obnoxious taxes upon clocks and
watches. English duties upon the cases
led to the manufacture of a remarkable
number of silver gilt and pinchbeck cases.
These latter were so named from an in
ventor of astronomic-musical clocks,
whose fame became worldwide and whose
name became an adjective In our lan
guage upon his discovery of an alloy of
metals closely resembling gold.
Not content Â¦with taxes upon the cases
of timepieces, Pitt proceeded to impose a
tax upon possessors and users of waiches
and clocks. As a result of thia unjust im
post many clock manufacturers were
ruined, hundreds of men were thrown out
of employment and only half the number
of timepieces were made. In order to
meet the impending scarcity of clocks
tavern-keepers unanimously adopted* for
the convenience of their patrons a con
splcuous but inexpensive wall clock,
named after the necessity which caused
its invention. "The Act of Parliament'

Lilly Kopp, "a pretty falr-halred child,
not yet three years old, was mangled by
an electric car yesterday morning in tlie
presence of her mother on Folsom street,
between Seventh and Eighth. The child's
left leg had to be amputated at the Re
ceiving Hospital, and it !s possible that
she may not survive the shock to her
system.
] l f he family had lived at 25 Folsom ave
nue, and three weeks ago the father went
to Portland to obtain employment. He
was successful and sent money to pay the
fare of his wife and two children to that
place. All their household effects and
trunks were sent to the steamer Colum
bia on Tuesday, and the family, consist
ing of the motner and two children, .Lilly
anil a baby six months old, went to spend
the night with a friend, Mrs. Annie "VVein
berg, 40 Moss street. Shortly before 10
o'clock yesterday morning Mrs. Kopp, ac
companied by her two children and Mrs.
"VVeinberg and Mrs. Esther flosenthal,
was standing on Folsom street, waiting
for a car to go to the wharf. Mrs. Kopp
had hold of Lilly's hand and in the other
hand carried a valise. Mrs. Rosenthal
had the baby in her arms.
Mrs. Kopp states that the car stopped
and she was assisting Lilly on to the
dummy when it suddenly started and the
child fell off in front of it. The fender
was unable to save the little one and the
front wheel caught her left leg just above
the ankle and threw her to the ground.
Mrs. Kopp became hysterical, and Chris
Gill, 1145 folsom street, who saw the ac
cident, rushed forward and dragged the
child away from the car and carried her
to Young's drug store, Folsom and Lang
ton streets. The ambulance was sum
moned and the little sufferer was taken
to the hospital. Dr. C. D. McGettigan,
who was on duty there, found both bones
of the leg so badly mangled that he de
cided to amputate the limb, which was
done with the assistance of Dr. Hopper.
Later the child was removed to the Lane
Hospital by order of the railroad authori
ties for further treatment.
Michael D. Murphy, the motonnan,.was
arrested by Detective Ryan and booked
at the City Prison on a charge of bat
tery. He was released on $25 cash bail.
He said that the child left her mother and
ran in front of his car. Three women
standing on the curb had signaled to him
to stop and he -was slowing up when the
child ran in front of the vehicle. 'He
claimed that he was not to blame. He
had been ov*er twelve years in the em
ploy of the company, he said, and this
was the first accident that had happened
him. His statement that the child ran
away from her mother in front of the car
is borne out by Edith Stolzenwald, 1153
Folsom street; Cleo Shaw, 1155 Folsom
street; G. Reifensteln. 1135 Folsom street,
and others who saw the accident.

New Steel Steamer for the Coast.
Robert Dollar the millionaire lumber
man, has contracted with the New York
ship building works at Camden. X. J.. for
a steel 5000-ton steamer, to be delivered
on the coast* next year. The new vessel
is to be 317 feet long, 40 feet beam and 26
feet daep, while her average speed will
bÂ« 15 knots. Mr Dollar istends her for
the coast trade and expects her to
be the finest thing of her class afloat.
The plans were drawn and all the con
tracts let while Mr. Dollar was in the
East, and on his return home yesterday

FOR WOMAN'S HEALTH
Earnest Letters from Women Re-
lieved of Pain by Mrs. Pinkham.
"Deab Mrs. Pinkham : â Before I
commenced to take your medicine I
was in a terrible state, wishing myself
dead a good many times. Every part
of my body seemed to pain in some
waj\ At time of menstruation my
suffering was something terrible. I
| thought there was no cure for me, but
after taking several bottles of Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound all
my bad feelings were gone. lam now
well and enjoying good health. I shall
always praise your medicine."â Mrs.
Amos Fescdler, Box 226, Romeo, Mich.
Female Troubles Overcome
No flore Pain
â¢'Deab Mrs. Pinkham : â I had female
trouble, painful menses, and kidney
complaint, also stomach trouble. About
a year ag-o I happened to pick up a
paper that contained an advertisement
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and when I read how it had
helped others, I thought it might help
me, and decided to give it a trial. I
did so, and as a result am now feeling
perfectly well. 1 wish to thank you for;
the benefit your medicine has been to
me." â Mes. Clara Stieber, Diller, Neb.
11 Dear Mbs. Pinkham :â Your Vege-
table Compound has been of much
benefit to me. ' When my menses first
appeared they were very irregular.
They occurred too often and did not
leave for a week or more. I always
suffered at these times with terrible
pains in my back and abdomen. Would
be in bed for several days and would
not be exactly rational at times. ; I
took Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and menses became reg-ular
and pains left me entirely." â Mbs. E.

Nc~jl' York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, June 27.â Prices failed to hold
in to-day's etock market and after an early
period of advar.ee turned generally downward
until the average level had fallen to below that
of last night. There was some irregularity in
the movement as among the industrials and
railroads, but the tone of the market during
the latter part of the day was undeniably
heavy- The irregularity consisted in the bet
ter resistance to the depression offeYed by some
etocks. This was true of the steel stocks and
of the coalers, the latter being affected by a
good showing of earnings for May by the Krle
and the Reading comparjes, by the announce
ment of an advance In the price of coal by
the Reding #:orr.pany ar.d by reports that
other companies would follow suit. Some of
the soft coal roads were also st-ong on the
rood conditions in that trade. I?ut the m rail
road list as a whole gravitated downward
quite heavily. The buying demand which was
in evidence yesterday and the day before and
frcm which much was hoped in rallying prices
showed increasing indifference and lassitude
at the higher level attained. The course of
the market was a striking tSEtlmony of the
dominance of the crop prospects as an in
fluence on prices. London and the European
bourses were ail higher on the reports from
cbroad cf the rescue of the foreign legations
by Adrr.iral Seymour's force at Peking and
the opening here was strong In pympathy. But.
the growing need of money did not avail to
hold prices in face of the rally in the wheat
market, which was accepted aa a plain inti
mation that the reaction in that market was
purely technical in its cause and that there
was no subsidence of apprehension of ex
tensive damage to the crop. The Hay state
ment of net earnings of the St. Paul Company
had a cumulative effect on sentiment in con
nection with the crop damage reports and all
of the pram carrying fared badly.
Northern Pacific was most affected and showed
an extreme decline of nearly 2 points. Great
Northern preferred lost 1% net. St.. Paul's
increase in operating expenses for May of over
17 per cent was a discouraging evidence of the
Inroads made by higher prices of material upon
the cost of operating railroads. The growing
ease of the money market In face of the pend
ing July 1 settlement is an agreeable surprise
to the speculative world. Not only do call
loans continue easy, but time loan rates were
quotably lower to-day notwithstanding the
fact that the sub-treasury b&Â» absorbed nearly
J2.000.000 from the market since last Friday
and that the dividend and Interest disburse
ments which must be arranged for at the
beeinnlr.g cf the fiscal year approaching are
the largest In the history of the country. The
total Is estimated at over $100,000,000.
Business in bonds was email, but prices were
much better held Â¦ relatively than in stocks.

The English country markets were firm at an
advance of 2s. '
Chicago was feverish,' opening at 81% c, ad
vancing to 84% c, declining to 83% c and closing
at ES%c, There was % of an Inch of rain at
Moorhead and light showers were reported In
Manitoba, but there was no general rain any
where, and the light fall was too late for ma
terial benefit. Minnesota reported light scat
tered showers, too late to be of service. Kan
sas is the last State to complain of the weather,
and yesterday wired apprehensions of damage
to the corn crop, as It was very hot there, with
rain needed In some sections. The Government's
weekly bulletins confirm private reports.
Snow estimates the entire crop at 460,000,000
bushels, and gives the showing of winter wheat
as follows: Ohio, 23; Indiana, 29; Michigan, 40;
Missouri, 90; Kansas, 96; Nebraskr., 75; Wis
consin. 75, these being declines of from 3 to 33
points from last report.
.. Corn was quoted strong owing to the bullish
reports from Kansas, and there was a good
shipping demand. On Tuesday 1,000,000 bushels
were taken at Chicago for export. â¢
The feeling at Chicago was nervous. There
was a good deal of stop order selling at the
opening, but later on the feeling was better,
and operators began to think the break over.
There was good buying of August below S3c.
Minneapolis edvanced l%c. Trading was enor

until the July trades are all closed out. - -

CHICAGO, June 27.-The liquidation which
set in Monday had not quite spent Itself last
night and some fag ends of It tumbled Into
the wheat pit at the beginning of business to
day. This, together with some declines in
Liverpool cables, caused easiness early. July
opened unchanged to Vie up at 82c to 82^4c
and quickly sold off to 81% c At this point
the liquidation took the form of scattered sell
ing. The demand was excellent from the
Northwest and the seaboard and sold out bulls
were also active In replenishing their stocks.
The remainder of the session consequently was
strong. Compared with recent sessions trade
was quiet, the rally was gradual and the best
price was not reached until afternoon, when
July perched at 84% c. The bulge brought out
profit-seeking stuff and a dip to 53% followed,
but the market quickly recovered to 83% c, and
closed firm, July l%c over yesterday at 83% c.
Liverpool, following her opening weakness,
turned strong. There was light rain In the
Northwest, but the opinion is general that the
Northwest crop- is practically beyond hope.
Corn did not share in the early weakness of
wheat, but readily responded to Its later
strength.*' The fear of possible damage to
growing corn from excessive heat or some
other cause was aggravated by reports of very
high temperatures in parts of Kansas, Okla
homa and Missouri. July closed l%c up.
Oats were strong. Trade was rather quiet
and the other grains were the chief Influence.
July closed a shade over yesterday at 25% c.
Provisions were strong and fairly active,
helped some by the grain strength, but chiefly
by a good outside demand. Jaly pork closed
52% c over yesterday, lard 22% c better and ribs
22^40 improved. Trade Is gradually shifting to
the September delivery and in this option pork
closed &0c higher and lard and ribs each
20c up.

TO BLACKMAIL WOMEN
THEIR ALLEGED PLAN
bAKLAND, June 27.â What the 'police
believe to have been the beginning of a
blackmailing scheme of a unique and ne
farious character, Involving prominent
families of this city, has been broken up
by^the speedy and well directed efforts or
Chief of Police Hodgkins. This was ac
complished by the seizure of a large num
ber of photographs of young women
which, it is said, were obtained by a pair
of evilly disposed young- Â¦ men who have
for several weeks been operating in Oak
land as solicitors for a San Francisco art
company.

enterprise was known as Professor C. E.
Quivey.- His companion's name was not
ascertained by. the police. The pair had
been living from week to 'week in various
lodging houses about town, and had been
compelled, for lack of. money, to leave
several . domiciles, although ; they were
dressed in the height of fashion.

be used, it is believed by. the detectives,
for manipulation so : that :>: > the . victims
would be made to appear in most indecent
arrd Â¦Â¦ suggestive poses. '.To cleverly 'work
up the photographs of prominent young
women's faces with nude figures .was sup

The City Attorney may be called upon
to determine if the B^ard of Health has
acted illegally in appointing Dr. F. P.
Wilson Assistant City Physician with the
understanding that h? ts to receive a fee
for every death certificate signed by him.
The charter provides that all fees collect
ed by an empiove of the city government
shall be turned into the treasury' and his
Â£aiarv shall be deemed in full compensa
tion for his services. The practice orig
inated under the old consolidation act,
the assistant physician being permitted
to retain fees without receiving salary.
His duties consist in visiting the Chinese
Q-jarter every <saj- for the furpose of in
tpectlng the undertaking shops. He also
rignÂ» the death certificate of every China
man who dies unattended by a physician
qualified to certify to the cause of death,

"The board is unaware that the charter
provision on fees affects the assistant
physician." said President Williamson of
the Health Board last night. "It is sim
ply an arrangement whereby the board
save? the salary of one man. Dr. Wil
for/s remuneration amounts to about
flO) per month, as the average Chinese
rf*ath rate monthly is less than 35. I sup
y>c*e we could pay him 1100 per month and
a.low the fees to go into the treasury,

OAKLAND, June 27. â "Make it a
tile."
"No; a job will do."
This rather vague scrap of con
versation floated out upon the hot after
noon air to-day in front of the Union Sav
ings Bank. Two gentlemen were standing
on the corner, engaged in earnest conver
sation. One was T. T. Dargle, one of the
proprietors of the Oakland Tribune and
member of the State Centra! Committee
of the Republican party from the Fiftieth
Assembly District. The other was Edson
F. Adams, one of the wealthiest men in
Oakland, banker, and proprietor of an ex
tensive system of dock 3.
The first remark was fh'ade by Mr. Dar
gie and the second by Mr. Adams, and it
was all an election bet upon the result of
the Congressional primary next August.
But the remarkable feature of the bet
was that Ed?on F. Adams was making a
wager that Henry P. Dalton would defeat
Victor H. Metcalf. while Mr. Darsie was
taking the side of Mr. Metcalf. The bet
was a modest one â only a hat. But It was
not the bet but the side taken by Mr.
Adams that raised the rncldent to the
value of news.
Two years apro County Assessor Henry
P. Dalton struck Mr. Adams in the As
sessor's office. They were then the most
bitter enemies in all Alameda County. In
those days Dalton was doubling the
Adams assessments and trying: to make
him pay all kinds of taxes. Mr. Adams
was lighting Mr. Dalton at every turn of
the road, personally, politically and le
gally. They were hiring special attornevq
with which to pro?erute each other. It all
culminated one morning when Mr. Adams
and his attorney went to Mr. Dalton's
office to serve him with a legal notice.
Words were passed and Mr. Dalton pro
ceeded to "mix" matters more thoroughly
with his fists, to the detriment of Mr.
Adams' complexion.
Now Mr. Adams is supporting Mr. Dal
ton for Congress where he opposed him
for Assessor. Mr. Adams does not hesl
j tate to pay that he is for Dalton and
against Metcalf. arid he tell 3 the story of
I why it is so if he gets talking.
Mr. Adams Is the owner of quite a con
siderable area of docks and wharves alonsr
the southern water front of Oakland. *For
several years Mr. Adams has been trying
to have the Federal Government dredge in
front of his wharves In order to increasa
their value. The citizens of Alameda. en
the other hand, have been trying to secure
the completion of the tidal canal. Thers
was not money enough in the appropria
tion to do both pieces of work and Mr.
Adams besran a campaign to have tho
dredging done before the tidal canal ws#
begun. The citizena of Alameda blocked
his desires and then he began a flght
acainst ever completing the tidal canal.
j This made trouble in Alameda. for the
I <=ewer system of the encinal city was de
signed with the expectation that the canal
would be finished, and to stop work upon
it now would be very serious to that city.
Mr. Metcalf decided that the tidal canal
was a necessity and he exerted his influ
ence in Congress for the completion of the
ditch. Mr. Adams labored with him. but
in vain. Mr. Metcalf was willing to help
the dredging of Oakland harbor alonsr.
and he began a campaign to secure more
money for Oakland that this might l>Â«Â»
done, but he stood by the tidal canal
first.
Now Ed?on F. Adams is waperine hats
that Henry P. Dalton will defeat victor
H. Metcalf for Congress.

There was more legal struggling over
the affairs of the estate of the late Cap
tain J. W. Smith to-day, and though At
torney P. C. Judkins abandoned the point
upon which he asked delay the last time
he found another point on which to' keep
the estate open and continue the flght
over the bonds of the California and Ne
vada Railway. Again did Attorney A. E.
Bolton. the attorney for C. H. Smith, the
ron and heir of the old railroad builder,
fay in open court that the railroad had
been sold and that this litigation was
merely a scheme to delay the sale.
When the case was called Attorney P.
C. Judkins did not urge the charge that
fome of the old items in the account of
the administrator had been illegally paid.
He was thoroughly satisfied when Admin
istrator C. K. King of the estate with
drew his final account and filed it as an
annual account. That prevented the clos
ing of the estate and gave him the time he
desired. -
C. K. Kinp stated that since the decision
of Commissioner Heacock he believed that
the bonds beloriged to the estate and he
was going to sue for them-
Attorney Bolton objected very strongly.
Then it was he announced that the road
had been sold and that this was merely
delay to prfevent the sale. He showed re
ceipts and quitclaims in full from all
heirs to-C. H. Smith, but Judge Ogden
continued the case until July 20 in order to
give time for this suit to be brought. I

By the upsetting of his wagon on 'the
Fish ranch road yesterday afternoon
Paul Stuener, a teamster employed by
"White Hat" Carthy, the horseman, was
pitched out and thrown fifty feet down an
embankment, suffering Injuries from
which he died this morning at Fablola
Hospital. Charles Burke, 15 years old,
residing at 322 Hitch street, San Francis
co, was also thrown out, but was saved
from death by being caught in the upset
wagon.
The big ranch team did not go over the
cliff, but balanced on the edge of the
grade. Assistance Was at hand quickly,
as a party of campers in the canyon wit
nessed the accident, and D. J. McCarthy,
W. D. Carroll and A. Shuey, who were
driving behind, came along in time to ex
tricate the boy and the horses from the
wreck. . v: 'Â¦Â¦*-Â¦
Stuener was dragged out of the canyon
unconscious. His skull was severely frac
tured. Both arms were broken, as was
the left leg, from the fall, his body hav
ing pounded heavily over protruding rocks
on the face of the cliff to the creek In the
canyon below. In the party who assisted
them were Dr. Will Moskiman of the
Oakland baseball team and Dr. Harry
Bell, who, with Miss Catherine Sarsfleld.
Miss Jennie Sarsfleld. Miss Josephine
Sarsfleld, Day Baxter and Harold Baxter,
were returning from a camping visit.
Stuener was taken with Burke, who suf
fered a bad lacerat'on of his legs, to
Fablola Hospital. He old not recover con
sciousness.
Burke explained that the team was up
set through the sharp cramping of the
wagon wheels when Stuener was makingr
an abrupt turn in the road just after they
had crossed the divide in the Berkeley
hills. The wagon was loaded with sup
plies for the McCarthy ranch In Contra
Costa County.
Little is known of* Stuener. He had
worked among the ranches In Contra
Costa County for some time. It was said
he recently received word from Germany
that he was heir to a large estate, but
that he would have to .work until a settle
ment of the property could be effected. An
inquest- was held to-night.

DOUBTERS.
GBAPE-NTJTS.
Can Be Changed by Knowledge.
If there is any doubt about making
brain power by the use of certain food,
the doubter should make the folloiving
experiment.
Helen Frances Huntington of Gaines-
ville, Ga., says: "Just a word of com-
mendation concerning " Grape- Nuts,
which I have found to be the mo?t
wholesome, nourishing and appetizing
food that has ever come to my knowl-
edge.
"I am not a dj'speptic. but being con-
stantly engaged in severe brain work I
found that I did not thrive on ordinary
diet: even a moderate dinner dulled
my brain so as to be practically inca-
pable of critical work. I tried mcat-
juice. peptonoids, the two meal system
of Sight breakfast and no supper, which
brought on nervous depletion and sleep-
lessness, so I resorted to one and an-
other of the various health foods, which
ail fecmed alike tasteless and valueless
as a brain food, until quite by chance I
had a dish of Grape-Nuts food served
as dessert. I liked it so well that I be-
gan to use it daily, for supper four tea-
spoonsful in a saucer of hot milk, eaten
before it dissolves to mtishiness. â¢
"This point should be remembered, as
â¢after a certain time evaporation seems to
affect the sweet, nutty flavor of the food,
as in the case of certain fine-flavored
fruits.
"The result in my case was simply as-
tonishing. 1 had no desire whatever for
sweet pastries, meats, or, infact t any-
thing else: and my^brain was as clear
and active at night as on awaking from
a long, refreshing sletp.
"The peculiar advamge about Grape-
Nuts food is that it supplies the nutritive
qualities of a varied diet without the bad
results of heavy eating. I cheerfully rec-
ommend its use to all brain workers, if
not as an exclusive diet, certainly for the
last mzil of the day. I always take it
with me when traveling, which saves a
deal of annoyance snd discomfort.** *

serve stake will be held on the following 1
Friday.
Rumors are already rife to the effect
that a third park, presumably that of the
San Mateo Coursing Association, will.be
opened. Should this be done the agree
ment existing between Ingleside and
Union Park will be void, each, park then
protecting Its interests.
The directors of Ingleside Park have ta
ken the first step toward building their
proposed new park. An assessment of $10
per share has Deen levied on the stock of
the coursing association. The money
raised in this manner will be applied to
the building of stands and preparing the
Held over which the greyhounds must
course.
On July 7yand 8 the gate receipts at
Union ParK will be presented to the
widow and four children left by John E.
Sweeney, the fireman who lost his life
while In the performance of his duty. A
considerable sum should be realized, as
Judge John Grace has paid $20 for one
ticket and others are expected to follow
his example. The usual admission fee of
25 cents will be exacted at the gate. ,

Erwln & Lyon's Silver Wings took firÃt
money In the midweek reserve Btake at
Union Coursing Park yesterday through
the withdrawal of R. E. fle B. Lopez's en
try, Wanda. The winner reached the
final by beating Slim in the fltth round.
Wanda was booked for a byÂ© and would
have gone against Silver Wings for stake
honors but for the unnecessary hard work
she made for herself in the fourth round.
With Slay Hempstead Wanda was slipped
to a strong hare. After winning a long,
hard course in which the jack was run to
the escape, the Lopez hound caught sight
of a stray hare and gave chase. Relief
dogs were turned loose, but were long in
reaching the game and Wanda in her
tired condition was about all out before
the kill was made, necessitating her with
drawal from the stake.^
J L R beat Erin at l.to 4 in the first
round. Erin led but was outworked. The
day's coursing was of the satisfactory
order and devoid of flukes. The results,

of drinks In the saloon of the last
named, corner of Pine and Dupont streets,
last night, and during the quarrel Ken
ealy fired a shot at Ostrander's head. Os
trander threw up his hands as Kenealy
fired- and the bullet struck him in the
left arm.
As soon as the shot was fired Kenealy
and Daily ran from the saloon, but were
caught by Policeman H. P. Braig- and
brought to the California-street station.
Kenealy admitted having fired the shot,
but claimed that he did it in self-defense,
as Ostrander reached for his pistol to
shoot him first. When searched at the
prison an ugly-looking dirk was found on
Dally.
A charge of assault to commit murder
was placed against Kenealy and a charge
of assault with a deadly weapon was reg

Ostrander was taken to the City Receiv

combination to again tighten Its grip on
the people's purse. Judge Bahrs' decision
has made known to the corporations that
the Railroad Commission is the authori
tative body In railroad matters in this
State, and that the Southern Pacific, not
withstanding- its wealth and power, can
111 afford to ignore its authority.
In his decision Judge Bahrs says:
This proceeding is taken pursuant to the pro
visions of the constitution of the State oÂ£ Cali
fornia directing the courts to carry into execu
tion the lawful decisions of the Board of Rail
road CommlFsloners.
It Is perfectly clear to me that the Board of
Railroad Commippfoners had Jurisdiction to
hear and determine the complaint of J. C.
Moore. The proceeding had were in entire ac
cord with the constitution and the statutes.
There fs. In fact, no question made as to the
regularity of the proceedings before the board.
As to the contention of the railroad
companies that they will be denied their
rights guaranteed by certain provisions
of the constitution of the United States
the court says:
Everj- statute Is presumed to be constitu
tional. The courts ought not to declare one
unconstitutional unless it Is clearly so. If there
Is doubt, .he expressed will of the Legislature
should be sustained. A fortiori is this true
when applied to a constitutional provision. The
will of the people of a State should not be de
feated unless there is no doubt that they have
violated the Federal constitution or its amend
ments.
I have shown. I think, judicial authority
which is entitled to the greatest respect, nega
tiving the contentions of the defendants as to
the illegality of the constitutional provisions
of our State in the particulars indicated.
Defendants have also asked the court to hear
testimony as to the reasonableness of the rates
charged "by them, and to determine that the
rate of J3 73 is unreasonable and conflscatory.
Even if it could be conceded that this power ex
ists in the court." I do not believe that the
court can exercise It until after the Board of
Railroad Commissioners has done bo. If the
[mwer exists at all. it can only be exercised in
review of the proceedings of the board, to pre
vent it from enforcing unreasonable rates,
Â¦which has been held to be a taking of property
Â¦without due process of law.
Inasmuch as it does not appear that our con
stitution Is violative of the Federal constitution,
or the amendments there, and inasmuch as the
dfcision of the Board of Railroad Commission
ers Is final, in matters within their Jurisdic
tion, except, perhaps, in the determination of
the reasonableness or rates, and inasmuch as
there 1* no Issue tendered by the pleadings upon
which the court can take any evidence, it fol
lows that plaintiff, the Board of Railroad Com
missioner* of the State of California, is entitled
to a final and perpetual injunction, carrying
into execution the decision set forth in the com
plaint, heretofore (riven and made by it, and the
same is hereby accordingly awarded.

Chauncey M. St. John, acting Surveyor
of the Port during the absence of Sur
veyor Spear In the Kast, has exonerated
Daniel J. O'Leary, customs Inspector,
from all blame in the matter of the de
portation of Wong Mei. Wong Mci was
deported through - a mistake on the part
of some one after Collector Jackson had
consented to allow Lyman I. Mowry, his
counsel, to file a brief on appeal, notwith
standing that the time for the appeal had
expired.
"Mr. O'Leary obeys no orders," said
Mr. St. John, "except such as j come
through this office, and such orders, in
the case of Chinese Immigrants, are al
ways given in writing, so that our records
will show every transaction of this office.
We put Wong MÂ£Â» on board the China in
pursuance of a written order from the
Collector coming through the Chinese bu-.
reau, and it was the business of the bu
reau to take him off." Mr. O'Leary has no
right to take orders from any onÂ© except
from the Surveyor of Customs, and if he
should do so we would take him to task
for it."
Mr. St. John's -attitude is significant in
view of the rumors that have been float-
Ing around the Custom-house for some
time past that Surveyor Spear, who went
to the Philadelphia convention to vote for
McKinley and Long, was laying the wires
to succeed Colonel Jackson as Collector of
the Port. Â¦ , â¢ .
The Collector admitted yesterday .* that
he had received Mr. Howry's charges by
mail and that they were the same as those
published in The Call, j He said that Chief
Dunn had reported to him that he (Dunn)
had Informed Mr.' O'Leary personally that
Chinaman No. -63 (Wong Mci). was to be
taken off the steamer and that O'Leary
had told* him that the matter had been
attended to. Chinese Inspector Barbour,
he added, had corroborated the statement
of Chief Dunn and Inspector O'Leary had
denied that Dunn had made any request
of him with reference to Wong Mei.
Chief Dunn laughed yesterday when
asked about the matter. \
"Wherever the blame may He," he said,
"no harm has been done. Wong was not
entitled to land In any event and he has
grone a little sooner than he otherwise
might. With reference to the stand* taken
by Deputy Surveyor St. John, I have only
to say that Collector Jackson Is the head
of this Custom-house, and his orders must
be obeyed. He Is above the Surveyor and
his deputy, and If he should give me or
any other Federal official an order to
transmit to the Surveyor the Surveyor
would be required to obey it. I am not
worrying about Mr. Mowry's charges nor
about the departure of his client, Wong
Mei."
Head of the Chinese Bureau Says
Collector Jackson Is Superior
to the Surveyor and His
Han.
