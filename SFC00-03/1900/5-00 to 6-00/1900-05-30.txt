had been preserved by Dr. KInyoun of
the Marine Hospital and Dr. Kellogg,- the
bacteriologist of the Health Board. This
was getting- down to bottom facts. Every
question of diagnosis hinges upon the
microscopical demonstration of the actual
existence of the plague bacillus either In
rhe living or the dead body. And here
were the tests as presented by Drs. Kin
youn and Kellogg. Dr. KInyoun sent his
microscope and specimen slides and Dr.
Kellogg brought not only those micro
scopic preparations which he himself had
made but also several portions of in
fected organs ?aid to have been removed
from the nine dead todies which now
leave such mute but valuable testimony
for accurate scientific Investigation. All
of these specimens were examined witfl

examined every specimen, and the exist

of them admits of no shadow of doubt.

of tho nine cases occurring from March

was very evident, however, that there
was something cf a very serious character
which was disturbing the community, and
this was verv easily discovered to be In
connection vrlth the "threatened quarantine

The Board of Health then met and
adopted the resolutions providing for a
quarantine of the Chinese quarter. Chief
of Police Sullivan advised the board to
proceed cautiously. He said- there were
white people living In the quarter.. It was
tneo left to the discretion of the Health
Officer and Chief of Police to modify the
lines of quarantine and report ' to the
board.

Dr. Itaum lURgested that the street cars
might be allowrd to go through the lines,
but to take no passengers. on nor Allow
riding on the dummy while so doing. He
said it would be a hardship, to the resi
dents of the Western Addition if car traf
fic was stopped. This was opposed by
Chief Sullivan, who said that to make the
quarantine effective no one should be al
lowed through the lines. Dr. Kinyoun
questioned the advisability of the. plan,
though he thought it could be done under
strict sanitary conditions. He said that
the board would be subjected t" consider
able unfavorable criticism if any excep
tion was made to the quarantine. Not
withstanding this opposition a letter was
sent to Manager Vining by the board
notifying him of the existence of the
quarantine around Chinatown. The letter
continues:
"In o.rder that cars belonging to your

Later in the day Mayor Pheian gave out
this statement to the Associated Press:
"The situation in San Francisco is as
follows: Between March 7 and May 1Â»
nine dead bodies of Chinese taken from
the Chinese quarter showed -evidences of
bubonic plague. Since the latter date no
person sick of plague has been found nor
has there been any death. The City Board
of Health keeps up a constant inspection
in Chinatown, and in consequence of the
decision of the Federal courts preventing
inoculation of Chinese about to leave the
city the Chinese district itself will be
quarantined in> order to protect outside
territory from even the remotest possi
bility of . contagion. .There is no fear
whatever among the people of San Fran
cisco nor Is there any danger. There has
been no Infection in th?- city proper, al
though Chinatown has been open during
this period. -The : measures adopted are
merely precautionary./ No fact is con
cealed "and no danger need be appre
hended. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦'

The Mayor asked If the existence of the
p.ague had pver N-en seriously questioned
except by the newspapers, and Dr. Wil
liamson said that a few medical gentle
men were pkeptical. but that the majorit'v
opinion favored the fact that there had
keen plague caFes.
Brandenstein desired the presence of

just arrived from Now York, and who

most minute investigation before t?kinK

William Thomas, who represents the
fruit canners, said: "The interests which
I represent would puffer more than any
other if a wrong decision in the matter i's

most of them will be thrown out of em

Kinyoun's Explanation.
Dr. Kinyoun explained his conn^-ctlon
with the action taken regarding the
plague and about his organization -of a
train Inspection service and a bay pa
trol, made necessary by the stand "taken
by *rtner States. This service was af
terward withdrawn, though It prevented
the exedus of Chinese or Japanese with
out a proper certificate.
' /' My experience." said Dr. Kinyoun.
has been in laboratory work- in Vienna
and Parip, and there I made a special
study of the subject. I have no shadow
of doubt that the piague has existed and
that the condition of Chinatown is such
that it will always form a nucleus for
the spread of disease. There is no dif
ference between plague cases and plague
infection. I would rather treat patent
cases of plague than be wandering In
the dark. The poison Is there and must
be eradicated. We cannot know just
where that plague Infection exists un
less we take proper precautions. At this
crisis I can only reiterate the orders of
my chiefâ a sanitary cordon Is necessary
around the infected area, also a house to
house Inspection of. all inmates; any
cases found to be taken to a hospital and
any suspected ca?e3 to be removed to a
place provided for them. Chinatown must
be restrictedâ that Is. as to Ingress and
egress: the organization of a disinfecting
corps is Imperative, and the destruction
of all the rats must be immediately com
menced. â .
"The . history . of the plague In Oporto

may be looked for here. The disease In

Chief Sullivan, who was present at the
meeting, immediately ordered the sur
rounding of the Chinese quarter men
tioned by a cordon of a hundred police
men, and this will be maintained until
the Health Hoard orders it removed.
At the met-ting of the Supervisors In
the morning Mayor Phelan Bald that the
object of the meeting was to hear from
ihe doctors and merchants regarding tho
existence of the bubonic plague in this

FRESNO, May 29.â A special meeting
of the directors of the California Raisin
Growers' Association was held to-day for
the purpose of determining the status of
M. Theodore Kearney as president of the
association. Mr. Kearney tendered his
resignation last Saturday contingent on
the refusal of the growers to in
crease his salary. The amendment to this
effect failed of a legal majority and the
growers v/ho remained after the comple
tion of the count voted to accept the res
ignation. Kearney holds that the number
who remained was too small to bind the
growers and wants to continue in office in
order to carry out arrangements with the
packing firms. The board submitted the
matter to counsel to-day, and it was the
outlook this afternoon that his request to
remain ?i.t the head of affairs without
prejudice and on the pledge, to resign as
soon as; the negotiations are completed
will be acceded to.
SENATOR HANNA WEARY
OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP
Again It Is DÂ«clared That He Will
Not Direct the Coming
Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. May 29.â Senator Han
na does not expect to serve as chairman
of the Republican National Committee
during another Presidential campaign.
Without wavering m his allegiance to his
great and good friend. President McKin
ley, or without any feeling of doubt as to
the result of the election next November,
Senator Hanna has admitted that one
term as chairman of the National Com
mittee Is about as much as an ordinary
man cares to endure. Only those who
have had actual experience in that posi
tion can appreciate the immense amount
of mental and 'physical energy required to
faithfully exercise Its duties.
It is the present Intention of Senator
Hanna to pack up his traps as soon as
the convention adjourns and go to some
quiet retreat, where he may be free from
the cares and anxieties of political and
business excitement. He says his Health
demands that ho. shall take a good rest
and keep away from the bustle and con
fusion of public life for several months.
It is probable that he will go to his home
In Cleveland, where he will be In long
distance telephone communication with
Washington. He is deeply interested in
the result of 'the coming election, and he
does not hesitate to say so; but he is con.'
tident that the campaign will be properly
managed by the pentleman who will .be
selected to succeed him as chairman of
the National Committee.
Nothing definite is known at this time
as to his successor, as the privilege of
naming the chairman of the committee
belongs to a majority of the members of
the National Committee to be chosen at
the coming convention at Philadelphia.

Director of Posts in Havana Re
quested That General Wood Give
Him a Bodyguard.
HAVANA, May '29.â Shortly after the
postal scandal was first exposed. Mr.
Rathbone. it Is said, requested General
Wood to give him a guard, as he feared
feersonal violence from Coryaon Rich, the
postal employe, who confessed to a know
edge of many of the fraudulent transac
tions. General Wood sugKested to Mr.
Rathbone that If a guard were always
near him people would take It for granted
that he v.ss. under arrest and the request
was withdrawn. â¢ -
To-day the; reason for making It became
known. It seems that on th*- dny after C.
F W. Neely was arrest-d Mr. Rich went
to Pathbor.e and wanted to explain that
ihe ?tealings were heavy. He was re
fuFed n hearing v.hen the nature of his
communication was known and then he
went to General Wood and tolci a '.I he
knew. , Mr. Kathbone denies that Mr.
Rich ever said a word to him on the sub
ject.
Mr Rich declares that when Neely left
he- (Rich) by Mr. Rathbone's orders gave
Neely an advance payment on his salary
to the amount of about $3uO. accepting
Neely's receipt. When the scandal waa
exposed, according to Mr. Rich's state
ment. Mr. Rathbone told him it would be
better to withdraw the receipt Immedi
ately and to replace the ca.Â«h. promising
to s'ee him reimbursed by the oisburslng
â¢ifflcer. This, Mr. Rich says, he did, but
Mr. Rathborte ordered the disbursing of
ficer not to reimburse him. The result Is
that in consequence of obeying Mr. Rath
bone he is without funds qnd he can see
no way of obtaining redress.
Clerks in the postoffice say it was well

ROBERTS READY TO
ENTER JOHANNESBURG
LONDON. May 23.-The following dis
patch has been received from Lord Rob
erts:
"GERMISTON, May 29. 6:30 p. m.-'iVa
arrived hero this afternoon without bcins
seriously opposed. No casualties so far
as I am aware in the main column and
not many, I trust. In the cavalry and
mounted infantry. The enemy did not ex
pect us until to-morrow and had not,
therefore, carried off all . their rolling
stock. "We have possession of the junc
tion connecting Johannesburg with Natal,
Pretoria and Klerksdorp by railroad.
"Johannesburg is reported quiet and no
mines, I understand, have been injured.
I shall summon the commandant in the
morninp, and if, as I expect, there is no
opposition, I propose to t?nter the town
with all the troops at noon."
Germiston is a suburb to the southeast
of Johannesburg railway junction and
General Roborts mentions it in his mes
sage to the War Office probably because
Elandsfontein Station is further east
ward. Additional evidence that the mlnÂ«s
are intact comes in a message received
by a mining company here to-day from
its Johannesburg representative, dated
May 28, saying "All right."
Lord Roberts' dispatch is regarded as
announcing , the virtual occupation of
Johannesburg and apparently the Boors
have again effected a retreat as there te
np mention of any prisoneifa or captures
except of rolling stock.
There will be some little anxiety pend
ins the actual occupation of llohannes
burg as there are rumors that* the town
has been. mined with the intention of
blowing up Lord Roberts and his staff on
their entry into that place.

threat was made simply with the inten

PRETORIA, May 28.-The British occu-
piod Zeerust this morning and a large
force is marching on to Llehtenburg.- An
olHdal bulletin states that the British
crossed the Vaal River Saturday. Gen

River. Five of the burghers were wound
ed and two were captured. The British
were 5000 strong.
By an order recently issued the Presi

Says He Will Be at Noon To-Day.
LONDON". May 2T?.â Lord Salisbury, who was enfrrtained at dinner this even
ing by the City of London Coi:rervative Association, made an Important
announcement regarding the Government's South African policy.
"The 'stop-the-war' party have used my r.arr.e." said the Premier. "In
support of their ideas, by stating that I promised there should be no annex
ation of territory, annexation of gold fields. I never gave a pledge. I never
meant to give a pledge. (Loud cheers.) I stated a simple historical fact. We
were accused of going to war for lust of gold and territory. It v/as one of
these calumnies which, under the favoring influences of Dr. Leyds. upread itself
over the presa of Europe. Nothing could be more untrue. We wcr.i to war to
abcte oppression of the* Queen's subjects in the Transvaal and because our ro
mcrstrar.ccs were met by an !ns;:!:!r.s ultimatum, to. which, if the QxiPfn's
Government hnd submitted, her power, rot only In Scuth Africa, but over her
colonies and dependencies, would have been at an end. We were farced into war
by the action of our opponents.
"To say that because we repudiated the greed of territory we therefore
bound ourselves never to annex any territory is a most ridiculous construction.
I dwell on this point because this mat;er of annexation is about to become u
burning question.
"We have made a tremendous sacrifice cf blcod and treasure in this conflict.
There are misleading prophets, whes? action looks as large In the coiurms of
newspapers as the action of more Influential ar.d powerful people, who misU-at!
the unlucky rulers cf the Transvaal to continue resistance far beyond the time
when all resistance has ceased to be even possibly successful. These men nx*
perpetually pressing us to make some conditions, to offer some arranged stip
ulations that shall leave a shred of independence to the republic*. Our oniv
certainty of preventing a recurrence of this fearful war ir? to insure that never
again shall such^vast accumulations ot armaments occur, and that not a shred
of the former independence Jt>f the republic shall remain. (Cheers.)
"We are not yet at the end of the war. but I shall venture to lay it d<-.wn
as a primary condition of any futuro settlement that precautions will be taken
of such a character that such a war will never occur again. Cf course, whai
measures will br necessary it Is .impossible at any moment to determine, be
cause that depends" largely upon the action and temper of those with whom we
have to deal. ,
"1 have already intimated that their resistance has gone beyond the limit
to which resistance could wisely go. It Is not for us to criticize their action in
what they are pleased to call self-defense, but they have acted so that every
bitterness created by the war and every severance of. classes and races have
been stimulated by every measure they have taken; ar.d so they go on.
"It will also be eur duty to protect those native races who have been s.>
sorely afflicted, and at the same time to so regulate their conduct and pollcy
that so far as possible there shall be a reconciliation and that every one
shall be a happy member of the British empire."
After the Master of the Rolls, Lord Alverstone. had proposed "The Imperial
Forces." Lord Salisbury again rose, holding a paper in his hard, and said:
"I find that Lord Roberts has occupied Johannesburg."
ThU* announcement was followed by a wild display of enthusiasm, the com
pany cheering for *Â»Bobs" and singing "God Save the Queen."

LONDON. May 30, 3:30 a. m.â Lord Roberts is bivouacking 1 in the suburbs of
Johannesburg and intends to mal:o a victorious entry at noon to-day.
Judpinjr from his dispatches fcj must have private information regarding
the disposition of the parrisjn in tha fort, as he does not seem to expect
opposition.
:. . Liord Roberts' cavalry have flowed beyond Johannesburg. A portion !s under
stood to be at Kuarfontoin, seven miles north of Johannesburg and within twenty
â¢miles of Pretoria. Lord Roberts, although with a broken bridge at Vereeniging
ar.d a wrecked railway behind him, has somc-hew managed to get forward suffi
cient supplies for Ills large force.
'- 'Â¦ At, he has beÂ«i ablt to Co so much, it is considered possible that he will be
outsLJe Pretoria l-'riday.^Thc rapidity of his advance is thought an extraordinary
'achievement even by grudging Continental critics.
: . The Boers, who were expected to fight along the line of hills known as Kiip
ll!vÂ«rsl>erg, abandoned the eastern end of the range near Lord Roberts' advance
Ur?<Â». but they moved their ground on the extreme right near Vanwicks Roo3t,
where they met General French's turn:r.g movement. The fighting continued air
: day and the result is yet mere conjecture. Probably the Boer rear guard suc-
Cfcded in keeping General French off and is now in the hills northwest of Johan
nesburg. ' .
ThÂ«; Standard has the following advices from Pretoria under Monday's date:
'Â¦"The Transvaal Government has opened or !s about to open peace negotia
tion?. It has cabled a final Inquiry to its agents abroad asking whether any hope
exists of cid."
'. Without doubt the prescr.ee of Lord Roberts with 40,000 men at Johannesburg
vill hssten the Transvaal's decision.
â¢ Â¦ Dispatches from Ix>urenzo Marques yesterday described President Kruger as
"wavering, hut demanding a guarantee that he shall not be exiled to St. Helena."
The righting burghers still continue to descr;. and the total collapse of the Boer
military organization is not far off. Bennett Burleig-h, wiring from Lord Roberts'
headquarters at Vereeniping on Sunday, Fays:
"I doubt if President Kruger can muster 15,009 men, as many of the burghers
have gone to their homes."
The stancher Boers are sending their families with wagons and stores to the
Zotupanebenj district. Whether Pretoria will be defended is uncertain, although
a Pretoria message, dated Sunday, pictures the work of defending the capital as
going on "with feverish activity."
; ... Pretoria is situated in a wilderness of kopjes and rangrs and is provided with
defense? that require at least 20.<XK> men to man them properly. There may still be
ione hard nut for the British to crack.
. . The last message out of Pretoria is the following, dated May 2S, and censored
by the Boor Government:
; "Krauz. acting as special commandant at Johannesburg, has issued a circular
to the officials <-oneomed warning them of the necessity of controlling the for
eign elements In the town and directing them to resist all attempts to destroy
life, meeting force by force."
: The Netherlands Railway Company vesterday notified the authorities at Lou
ror.zo Marques that it must decline to accept goods for delivery at Johannesburg.
Johannesburg telegrams are still accepted, subject to stoppage at Pretoria.

liOKUOX, May SO.â Th^ Dally Express
tz.% the, following telegram from Shang
hai, dated Tuesday:
WASHINGTON. May 29,â Such advices
as .have reached here Indicate that the
situation in China has assumed a very
critical phase and one calculated to tax
the entire resources of 'the Chinese. Gov
ernment The State Department has been
in c'.cse communication with Mr. Conger,
our Minister at Peking, and the Navy
Department is doing its share, having
placed the flagship Newark as far up the
Peiho River as the Taku forts, which is
tho noarest point to Peking that the ship
can reach. The operations of the Box
ers are increasing in magnitude. Their
demonstrations are no longer local and
they appear to be governed in their move
ments by some well settled design. They
have murdered nine Methodist mission
aries in one province, at the town of Pa
chow, and have closed in on Peking.
Meanwhile the Chinese army is suspect
ed of disloyalty, this belief being
strengthened by wholesale desertions of
soldiers to the Boxers.
Minister Conger has appealed to the
State Department for the protection of a
marine guard for his legation. The de
partment has promptly cahled an au
thorization to call upon the nearest
United States naval vessels for assist
ance. It is not known yet whether he
has availed himself Â¦ of the permission.
The ship he would naturally look to
would be the Newark, and it is assumed
that he has already communicated with
Admiral Kempff on board that flagship.
ThÂ© embarraFsir.ff feature of the situa
tion is the cutting of the communication
by rail between Taku and Teintsln and
the capital, for the Boxers have burned
the railroad bridges and there are prob
ably only two courses open to the ma
rines who wish to reach Pekingâ a long
overland march through a hostile country,
away from supports, or a tedious voy
age up the swift and shallow Pelho in
shore boats in. tow of the steam launches.
According to report the Chinese Gov
ernment has done everything in its power
to meet the demands of the diplomatic
body at Peking for the dispersion of the
Boxers, but it appears that the upris
ing Is far more serious than was at first
apprehended, and even toe resident mln-

A hundred American marines from the

Belgians. The Viceroy, under the pres
sure of the French Consul, has permitted
the rescuers to travel by railroad to
Feng Tal, where Chinese protection ends.
The litlgians are besieged at Chang-

Debate on proposed changes in the ratio
of representation to general conferences
consumed much time. Arguments were
made in favor of the majority report rec
ommending a ratio of one delegate to ev
ery sixty preachers instead of one dele
gate to every forty-five preachers, as now
prevails. It was contended that the prjes
ent body was unwieldy. This statement
was vigorously combated by several
speakers and the conference by an over
whelming vote decided to make no
change.

Principal among the important actions
4t the conference were the abolition of
the time limit on pastorates; the ratifica
tion of the equal representation amend
ment as proposed by the Rock River con
ference, together with the seating of the
provisional lay delegates; the adoption of
a new constitution, subject to the ap
proval of the various annual conferences,
including substitution of the words "lay
members" for the term "laymen," thus
permitting the seating of women in the
general conferences, and the election of
two additional missionary bishops.
The report of the committee en educa
tion, which was under discussion at last
night's session of the conference, was
taken up for final action to-day. An
amendment offered by Dr. Jordan of
South Dakota, requiring the university
eenate of the church to recognize certifi
cates from students from other than
Methodist colleges presenting themselves
for examination for the ministry, caused
considerable discussion. The report as
amended was finally adopted. The con

CHICAGO, May 29.â The twenty-third

Sister.
Mamie Gaynor, a' comely young woman,
was found by Policeman Mitchell wander
ing on Minna street, near. Seventh, about
4 o'clock yesterday morning. She had no
hat and appeared to be slightly under the
influence of liquor. The officer advised
her to go home, which wag near by, but
she refused, and while they were talking
the girl's father appeared and said she
had beaten him. He wanted her arrested.
She appeared before Judge Cabaniss yes
fÂ»rday on a charge of disturbing the peace
and the Judge convicted her. She objected
to being convicted and said it was her
twin sister who struck the old man. "Will
you .take your sentence ..to-day or the day
after to-morrow?" asked the Judge, and
she replied, "The day after to-morrow."
She wanted to have Â¦ her twin sister In

her^ request. She . abused her father In

Norman Pierce, another llerce rounder of

forth to do his worst upon the body of

Tivoli.
"Mr. Worthlngton," said Ilines, "you
have aroused my mortal hatred and my
anger must be appeased with blood. You
have maligned me and tried your hardest

this you shrill suffer. Your days as a
leader of the hammer and anvil chorus

who. presided at an election in that com
pany and refused to recognize the candi
dacy of O'Reilly for the position of cap
tain on the gTound that within six months
next preceding the election he had failed
to qualify before the examining board for
first lieutenant. The general sustains the
protest, declares the election null and void
an<l s-ays a Hew one will be called for.
The reputations for the government of
the guard as laid down in the red book
declare that if a man is elected to a com
missioned position and falls to pass the
o.\m mining board he cannot within six
months apply for the same commission.
In thiÂ« case OHtilly, who had failed to
pass the examination for first lieutenant,
did not apply for the samy commission,
but applied for a higher-, one. Mnjor

the effect that while the regulation read
'the same commission" it meant "any
commission." The brigadier general was
not in tho city when the communication
was forwarded, and when he heard of tho
matter declared that, he had not made any
such construction of the law and had not
authorized such a statement. He repeated
this before the protestants at the time of

SUSTAINS THE PROTEST
WASHINGTON, May 29.â The Demo
cratic members of the House of Repre
sentatives held a caucus in the hall of
the House to-night to consider the trust
question, which is to be brought before
the House during the next three days, and
other pending legislation. The caucus
was attended by about eighty Democratic
members. At the outset Richardson "of
Tennessee offered the following resolu
tion, expressive of the party attitude:
Whereas. There Is known to be a large and
ErowinK surplus in the Treasury over and
above the neceusities of the Government, aris
ing from the taxes levied ami collected under
the. war tax act of 18PS, therefore,
Resolved. That we favor the reduction of the
taxes provided for in Fal.l hill and we do not
think the present session of CunRreps should
adjourn until saiil taxes shall have been re
pealed as to certain articles and reduced as to
others, until there is a total reduction In the
:iRsr.-t;.'itÂ« of at least E0 per cent. .
Wo pledge- ourself at all times to support any
measure or measures providing for such re
duction. ; Â¦.i"."'
The resolution was adopted without di
vision.
The trust question was then taken up.
Ball of Texas presenting resolutions fa
voring an adverse vote on the anti-trust
constitutional amendment and a favora
ble vote on the proposed Democratic anti
trust substitute bill. The resolution fur
ther provided that in the event of the
defeat of the substitute, support would
be given to the anti-trust bill as reported.
The resolutions brought out extended
debate and considerable difference of
opinion as to the manner of dealing with
the trust issue. The Democratic members
of the Judiciary Committeeâ -Terry ,De Ar
mond, Lnnham and othersâ favored action
along the lines of the Ball resolution. The
Ball resolution was finally adopted with
minor amendments... As to the substitute
anti-trust bill, the resolution states:
We believe that the adoption of these drastic
provisions will demonKtrate the power of Con
press to destroy combinations, monopolies and
the consolidation of capital familiarly called
trust*.
Should the substitute fail of adoption
the resolution then provides for support
ing the anti-trust bill reported by the ma
jority. As to this measure the resolution
says:
While not satisfactory to the Democratic
minority, - and .. not likely to remedy the trust
evjl, this Mil. does make an effort toward
liaragains and outlawing these enemies of the
public, nnrt Democrats are. not Â¦wlllinsr to vote
down any measure tendlncc to that end.
The resolution further urges Democrats
to vote against the constitutional amend
ment unless it be so amended as to leave
the States > unhampered in enacting anti
trust laws. .

in the House Should Their
Substitute Be Voted
Down.

Former Queen Liliuokalani
Sails for Her Island
Home to Die.
Custom-Eouse and Internal Eevenu
Officers Who Will Organize Those
Services in Hawaii Also
Go on the Peking.
Â»
ITawallans predominated In the crowd
that gathered to see tho steamer City of
Peking sail for Honolulu and tho Orient
yesterday. The Chinese and Japaneso
on the wharf did not number a score,
whereas on sailing days hitherto they
have been numbered by the hundreds.
The departure of ex-Queen Lllluokalanl
drew the Hawaiians to the Mail dock.
She was accompanied by Mr. and Mrs.
Macfarlane, Dr. J. H. English, her phy
sician, John D. Amoka, Joseph -Heleluhe
and Miss Heleluhe, and two or three more
of her personal friends. The ex-Queen
does not look well, and it Is said she Is
going home to die. All the medical skill
of the East could not save her, and as
soon as the news was broken to her
Lilluokalanl decided to hasten home and
end her days among her own people.
The Hawaiian quartet was down to see
the steamer away, and the members
sang a number of native songs, and
when Lilioukalani appeared in the door
way of the Social Hall they struck up
"Hawaii Xei."
Burt M. Thomas and F. H. Drlscoll.
from the office of the Internal Revenue
Agent, and R. M. Frick, chief deputy in
the office of the Collector of Internal
Revenue, were also pa.ssenpexs on the
Peking. They are bound for Honolulu to
establish a system of internal revenue
for Hawaii. Mr. Thomas expects to be
gone about two months. Dr. Day, port
physician at Honolulu, was also a pas
senger. Frank Richardson, one of the
Bay City Wheelmen, is to make hfs home
in Honolulu for some time to come. He
takes charge of the Government cold
storage plant on his arrival In the isl
ands. The Misses Alice and Theresa
Rooney were also among the Peking's
passengers. The young ladles are to make
a tour of the Â¦world.
Two Valuable Cargoes.
The mail steamer Australia sails to-day
for Honolulu with one of the most valu
able cargoes aboard that has ever gone
to the islands. It is nearly all composed
of general merchandise. Some machinery
and hardware completes the lading of the
vessel. Among those who will leave on
the Australia will be Harry Thoma3, the
Custom-house broktr. He is making â¢ a
business trip to the islands. Special
Agent \V. S. Chance and Special Deputy
Collector Andrew Smith will also go to
Honolulu on the steamer. They will do
for the customs service In the islands
what Thomas and his associates will do
for the internal revenue service.
The Taciiic Mail Company's steamer
Algoa will sail for the Orient In a few
days with tho largest cargo that ha3 ever
left this port in one bottom. She will
carry about 17,000 tons of general mcr
chR.ndise. all of which is for Japan and
China. Among the consignments going to
Japan are 15H carloads of whlto rye
whisky and alcohol. Then there will be
several thousand tons of flour, wire and
wire netting, and machinery enough
aboard to load half a dozen ordinary ves
sels.
Bound for Cape Nome.
Another party of geld hunters started
for the frozen' north yesterday. They left
in the little schooner Prosper and expect
to make Kotzebue Sound In about six
weeks. The venture was engineered by
"Joe" Fretse. son of Captain A. C. Freese,
but at the last moment he could not get
away, so the party is under the leadership
of Captain John E. Helander. With him
are \V. N. Letcher. Alex Mins and four
others, bepides a crew of three. At Kot
zebue Sound the supplies for the French
mission will he landed and then the
schooner will be sailed back to Nome
where the gold hunters will disembark.
The Prosper will then go into the passen
per trade between Cape York and Cape
Nome and St. Michael.
The steamer Noyo will sail for Nome
this afternoon. She will take av.-ay about
fifty-six passengers, all the Klmball Com
pany wxwM take on tho vessel. In the
'tween decks she carries thirty-six head of
horses. Captain P. A. Johnson, for
merly of the steamer Mount Eden, will
take the Novo to Nome.
The steamer San Juan of the Mail Com
pany's line has been added to the Alaska
Commercial Company's Nome fleet and
will probably get away in company with
the San Jose next Saturday. The San
Jose carries an enormous cargo to the
north, but will only take about 150 passen
pers. while the San Juan will take away
about 4>v> gold hunters. The steamer
Humboldt also sails Saturday, so there
will be another exodus on that date.
New Scbooner Launched.
The four-masted schooner William 01
sen. built for the Mexican trade, was
launched from Hay & Wright's yards at
Alameda Point yesterday.- The new ves
sel Is a sister s?h!p tr> the Philippine and
should prove herself a clipper. Captain

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 29.â Justice Rosenthal
to-day rendered judgments in about forty
sults brought by the Union Savings Bank
against stockholders of that institution
to collect a $10 per share assessment lev
ied by the bank directors. The judgments
are all under $300 and amount to between
$4000 and $G000. Some were entered by de
fault. The charges in each case amount
ed to $5 25. It Is not believed an appeal
will be taken, as the stockholders against
whom judgments were secured in the Su
perior Court are paying up. Money Is
rapidly coming into the bank from these
sources, and Attorney Welch, who repre
sents the depositors' organization. Is en
deavoring to hive another dividend paid
to the depositors.

Tight Otters Injured by Bullets That
Were Fired Indiscriminately
by TTain Crews, Strikers
and Sympathizers.
ET. LOTJIS. May, 23.â In a rioting sensa
to-day's developments were the worst ex
perienced since the strike on the lines of
the St. Louis Transit Company was In
augurated, over three weeks ago. The
rioting- was confined to the southern sec
tion of the city, and by nightfall the police
records showed that fully a dozen persons
had either received bullet wounds or been
hurt by flying missiles. Three of the per
sons hit by bullets received what are
probably mortal wounds, and that no one
was killed outright seems miraculous, con
sidering the great number of shots ex
changed in Indiscriminate fashion on the
part of the employes of the company, the
eirike sympathizers and the strikers them
selves.
The list of to-day's casualties follows:
. HERMAN PKSXlCHlCi;, shot in the
back, fatal.
JOHN T. RICE, shot through the chest,
fatal.
R. H. STILSON. Cleveland. Ohio, shot
through the chest, fatal.
John McCaUey, shot In knee; Dolly
Slitchell, ehot in right ana. "William
Grar.neman, shot In left leg; George La
costan. ehot in left arm; Albert Wack- i
witz, shot in right arm; John Decker, shot ,
in left thigh: frank Yeager. shot in hand;
Martin Burke, shot In hip.
Two of the riots occurred on South
Broadway as a result of the attempt of
the Transit Company to run its cars.
"i'he nr?t ditfturi>a.nce occurred at the in
tersection of Broadway and Miller street.
LJcnf.res had been started during the
night, and the crew of the first car out j
lound the tracks encumbered with the i
debris. A big crowd, composed of men, j
Â¦women and cnildren. was gathered at the
corner, and they hooted and Jeered the
crew as it attempted to remove the ob
structions. Almost immediately shooting
commenced from the car. The crowd scat
tered in every direction and in the great
est confusion. A schoolgirl named Dolly
Mitchell screamed and tell to the side
walk- She was borne to a place of safety,
and on examination it was found that she
was shot through the arm and was not j
seriously hurt.
The second clot occurred at Broadway j
and Pestalozzi streets. At the time a j
large crowd was gathered at the alley i
through v/hich the railway switch to the i
Anbeuser-Busch Brewery runs. As a j
cur passed the point the crowd first com- !
menced to Jeer at the crew and then be
gan to pelt the car with rocks and other
missiles. As socn as the car was thus as
saulted the tiring began. In all twenty
rive or thirty shots were flred. I'he crowd
began to run up the alley just as soon as
the firing started. Herman Pestichke, a
boy employed in the bottling department
of the brewery, was the first to fall with
a bullet in the Â«mail of his back. His
epine is injured, causing paralysis below
the point of injury, and his recovery is
thought impossible.
As soon as the trouble began a riot call
was sent to the Chief of Police and
twenty-live men were hurried to the
gcene. Edward J. Bresner, the conductor
on the car. was arrested and locked up,
charged with shooting Pestichke. Bresrrer
stated that he had snot when the others
In the car commenced firing, after the i
crowd attacked the car. He said he did j
not know whether he had hit any one or
not The three wounded men denied that
they had taken any part in the attack on
the car.
The most riotous disturbances occur
red near the intersection of California
avw.ue and Keokuk street. In this af
fray a non-union motorman and another |
employe on a car of the Transit Com
pany were probably fatally shot. The
oattie. while it raged, was fierce, and In
view of the large number of shots fired,
estimated at IK-J. It is remarkable that
tbere were net more Injured, if there
were they were removed before the police
could get to the scene.

LAYTONVTLLE, Cal.. May 23.â A most remarkable phenomenon resem
c.lr.jf in every way a volcanic eruption was observed to-day twelve miles
trom here on the mountain side. The discovery was made through hear
ing a. thundering, grinding noise, lyhlle immense clouds of vapor were seen
to issue from the mountain side. The inhabitants en drawing near the
scene of the disturbance discovered a clearing of about six acres, which Is
completely surrounded by a dense growth of timber. The opening is bar
ren of vegetation and some tv*enty-flvo miniature craters exactly resem
bling volcanoes in shape were seÂ«n to rise out of the ground from four to
five feet high and about el^ht feet in diameter. Each crater was belching
forth warm vapor, accompanied by mud, throwing the mud about twenty
feet high, which would flow down the mountain in a lava-Hke stream. A
costisxious tremble of the earth Is felt and the rumbling of the active
eruption of the volcanoes Is heard for miles away. Great crowds of peo
ple orÂ« camped en the mountain to-night viewing the spectacle.

the obstructions from the track. As Stil

Gives Continued Ill-Health as tli-3
Only Reason for His Retirement,
but Other Causes Are
Hinted At.
PARIS. May 2C.-General the Marquis
de Gallifet. Minister of War, has resigned.
It is officially announced that his succes
sor is General Andre.
In his letter to M. Valdeck-Rousseau,
tthe Premier, asking him to place the res
ignation in the hands of the President of
the republic General de Gallifet pleads 111
health as a reason for his decision. His
exact words are:
"I am very unwell, and my health pre
vents me resisting all emotions of the
moment."
The official journal this morning there
fore contains the acceptance of the resig
nation embodied in a decree signed by M.
lxmbet which also appoints the new ilin-
Ister of War.
After deciding upon General Andre aa
the most suitable successor, the Premier
telegraphed to him at Nemours, where he
was taning part in the maneuvers. Gen
eral Andre left immediately, arriving in
Paris about 11:15 o'clock last evening. The
Interview at the Ministry of the Interior
lasted about three-quarters of an hour.
An understanding was rapidly reached on
all points in the Ministerial programme,
; and at midnight the Premier was able to
send the decree to the official journal.
In spite of his plea of ill health, this 13
not generally considered the sole reason
for the resignation of General de Gallifet.
Â¦ Having in view the apologetic statement
made by M. - WaldeclÂ£-Rousseau In the
Chamber of Deputies, there seems little
doubt that he was annoyed by the word
"felony" applied to an officer of the
French army, although there is little dif
ference between this language of the Pre
mier and that which General de Gallifet
had himself used at a previous sitting.
The Ministerial organs continue to give
ill health as the sole reason, the Figaro
pointing out that, strictry speaking. Gen
eral de Gallifefs word "crime" is much
harsher than "felony," which "exactly
describes* Captain Fritsch's attitude of re
volt toward his superior."
Whatever the true explanation, there
can be no doubt on one point. General de
Galllfet's retirement is regarded with con
siderable regret. His straightforward con
duct and his vigorous manner of dealing
with opponents were the delight of his
friends, and his rugged eloquence at tlmea
compelled the admiration of even his ene
mies. Under his direction the army has
benefited by quite a number of reforms,
the most recent of which was his pro
hibition of the sale of harmful intoxicants.
He also forbade that certain newspapers
noted for their attacks upon the army be
placed at the military clubs.
It Is difficult to say what the effect will
be upon the Cabinet. General Andre was
appointed a general of division a year ago.
He is an.ofiicer of the Legion of Honor.

A POPULAR MISTAKE
Regarding Remedies for Dyspepsia
and Indigestion.
The r.r.tior.al disease of Americans Is in-
digestion, or In Its chronic fornr. dyspep-
lin, ar:d for the very reason that'll Is so
common many people neglect 'taking
proper treatment for whet they consider
irl'.'.ir.u ptomach trouble, when as a mat-
ter o" inci i.TJipostlon Tays.the foundation
for many Incurable diseases.- No person
v.ith a vigorous, healthy stomach wlll'fall
a victim to consumijticn. Many kidney
diseases and heart troubles date their be-
ginning from poor digestion; thin, nervous
people are really so because their etom-
aclis arc out of gear; weary, languid,
faded out v.-omc-n o-,ve their condition to
imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you rne-n J-j
aSSJctcl with weak digestion it Is not sur-
prising that nearly every secret patent
rr-c-c5cine on the market claims to be a
cure for OytpepsS&l as well as a score of
other trouble*, v.hen. In fact, as Dr.
Werthkr says, there is but one genuine
cyspepsia euro which Is perfectly safe and
reliable, and, moreover, this remedy is not
a pattnt medicine, but It Is a scientific
combination of pure prpsln (free from ani-
mal matter), vegetable essences, fruit
Milts and bismuth. It is sold by drug-glsis
under tJie name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. No extravagant claims are made
for them, but for Indigestion or any stom-
ach trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
jire far ahead of any r<*meGy yet discov-
ered. They act on the food eaten; no
dieting is niccessary; simply eat all the
â¢wholesome food you want, and .hese tab

FIGURES OUT SURPLUS
BY USING PARK FUND
That is the sort of thing which is called "quaran
tining against the bubonic plague." The farce of it
is." nearly as great as the fraud, but the thing is no
matter for laughter. A fearful wrong is being per
petrated for the sake of making politics for Phelan
nnd his bubonic Board of Health, and even the silli
re?s of the quarantine established will not lighten the
"*i:se of public indignation against the fraud. .
Business dealings between those within and 4ho;e
without is easy. A man on the outside, whether
white man or Chinaman, who wifh.es anything in
Chinatown calls by telephone some one within the
quarantined district to the barrier, and there they
converse or pass packages to and fro aÂ« they please.
\\ that a quarantine? ' .
The 5treet cars continue to pas<* up and down
through the quarantined section. A white man by
setting on a car can enter the district, get off.
transact business with Chinese, and then come out
when' he pleases. Why is that permitted?
Around Chinatown there has been stretched a
trccha partly of rope nnd partly of wire. The rules
ere that no white man can enter, but any white man
can come out; no Chinaman can come out. but any
Chinaman can enter. If there be plague in China
town why gre white men who have been in contact
with it permitted to come out and go where they
choose? Why are Chinamen who have not been in
contact with it permitted to go in and catch it?
SHOULD any one desire further proof than ap
. pears on the face, that the scare arranged by
the bubonic Beard of Health is a fake and a
fraud, the proof can be found in the manner in which
ihe Chinatown quarantine has been established and
is being carried out. When it is remembered that the
bubonic plague' is one of the most awful scourges that
afflict humanity, it will be admitted that if the bu
bonic doctors really believe the plague to be in the
city they would undertake its eradication with some
thing more than "a vain pretense and empty show
01 vigor. When, therefore, it is seen that the so
called- quarantine set rp by the board is a silly farce,
the intelligent observer will at once conclude that the
bubonic ' board ddes not believe its own assertions
and is making a scare solely for purposes which its
members -re too cunning to avow.
THE FARCICAL SIDE OF IT.
It is due to this ignorance on the part of officials
at Washington that so much difficulty is experienced
in every effort made to obtain reasonable appro
priations for Pacific Coast improvements.. To tha
same fact is due the lack of a larger immigration of
home-seekers to this coast. Washington and Oregon
are supposed to be as bleak and inhospitable as Maine
or New Hampshire, and California is believed to be
as hot and unhealthy as Florida or Mexico. Mr.
Jones Was quite right in furnishing Congress with a
geographical, industrial and commercial description
of Washington, and his only. /error lay in the neglect
to include the whole Pacific Coast in the 'scope of
his lesson.
Such statements sound like satire, and yet they are
but a plain story of the ignorance of Western con
ditions w r hich prevails in the East even among men
who are sufficiently intelligent to be elected to Con
gress or to be appointed to governmental positions.
Â¦Mr. Jones confined his citations to examples of ig
norance displayed concerning his own State, but had
he chosen he could have furnished just as many of an
equal lack of . information concerning > Oregon or
California.
"While we have a climate milder in winter and
cooler in summer than Washington City," he said,
"men have asked me if it is possible to enjoy one
self in such a high latitude. While we produce all
sorts of agricultural products, men have wondered
how we can afford to live there and buy things from
the East. While we have on Puget Sound the best
and largest Government dock on the Pacific, high
officials of the Government have refused to allow
transports to come to Puget Sound because they
could not be docked. 'While Puget Sound is con
nected with the Pacific Ocean by a channel from
three to twelve miles, wide, and from 300 to 600 feet
deep, a great statesman of our country asked if there
were any channel by which large vessels could reach
the sea.' f
/"-Â» CONGRESSMAN JONES of Washington re
( cently took occasion to deliver in the House
of Representatives a speech containing an
elaborate description of Washington, with a state
ment of its resources and its prospects. B} way of
explaining why he made a speech on such a subject
Mr. Jones gave some illustrations of the ignorance of
Eastern Congressmen concerning this section of the
United States, and in doing so amply justified him
self'in taking up the lime of the House and the pages
of the Congressional Record in giving information
concerning his State.

COUNTY CLERK SELECTS
A WOMAN FOR COPYIST
ONE of the severest arraignments of oiir con
sular service which has been recently pub
lished appears in the Rio News of Rio de
Janeiro of April 17. It describes the average
United States Consul in South America as a man not
only untrained for foreign service, but having no
business experience or ability, skilled only in ward
politics, and offensive to both the people of .the
country to which he is accredited and to Americans
doing business there.
After the unflattering picture of the Consul him
self, the writer (Frederick Leslie Rockwood) goes on
to declare that the methods of transacting cpnsular
affairs are as bad as the characters of the men who
administer them, and says: "If the people of the
United States think that Uncle Sam's commercial
bureaus in these countries are run in the interests of
commerce and trade, if they think that the American
coat-of-arms and the American flag protects them
commercially, they were never more mistaken in
their lives, for the inside working is a hindrance and
backset to our foreign trade, to our commerce, to
our good relations, to our self-respect, to our pio
neers of trade and development."'
As the author of the criticism is not widely known
his statements would hardly deserve notice were it
not that they are indorsed by the News itself. Com
menting upon them the paper says editorially: "The
writer is a keen business men, who has visited every
country in South America in the interests of one of
the largest manufacturing establishments in the
United States, and it must be admitted that he knows
exactly what he is talking about. He has come in
contact with American consular officials 'in every
port visited, and when he complains of their character
and methods he speaks with unquestioned authority."
With that indorsement given by a paper published
I in the English language and devoted to the commer
| cial interests of the United States, the report of the
writer becomes a 'matter deserving of serious con
sideration. It must not be supposed that the com
plaints are made against all Consuls. It is conceded
that many of them in South America as well as else
where are men of -.vorth who render good service,
but the News says that even in the case of able Con
suls there is a just cause of complaint, inasmuch as
they are not retained in office.
It thus appears from the testimony of Americans
on the spot that among the reasons why we do not
obtain a fair share of the trade of South American
countries is because our Government appoints men to
consular positions less for fitness than for their po
litical influence. We have therefore ourselves to
blame for a lack of South American markets for our
goods. Such testimony ought to have weight with
Congress when the time comes to deal with reform
iii the consular service. As the News says: "The
power and influence of the United States rest upon
its educated classes, its industrial energy, its commer
cial acutcness, its moral strength, and these are the
qualities of character which should be found in every
J representative abroad."

OUR CONSULS IN SOUTH AMERICA.
tH|ROM her place as the western gateway of the
republic. San Francisco has had the honor of
..welcoming home the men who in the wars in the
Philippines have attested once more to the world the
valor of American armies and the loyalty of Ameri
csn patriotism. To the men of each returning regi
ment that welcome has been given, cordial, warm and
spontaneous. Nov.- comes to us after his long service
the general under whose command our military suc
cesses in the Philippines have been attained. To him,
therefore, our welcome will be as earnest as that ac
corded to our own volunteers and should be marked
by every observance of military and civic distinction.
.Ger.eral Otis has not escaped the criticisms of those
?;hb' out of their ignorar.ee of war condemn every
thing.they do not understand, nor the abuse of those
whose easy-flowing slander delights in a shining
inark.; The conditions of the strife in the Philippines
against an evasive and cunning foe have given no
opportunity for the American army to strike one of
those crushing blows which achieve brilliant victories
and constitute the glory of war. There was but little
in the way of a triumph which would attract the pub
lic mind .and win popular applause to be done in the
.Philippines after Admiral Dewcy destroyed the Span
ish fleet. The work which has been done since th.it
time has required patience, labor, tact and skill, but
"jt has yielded nothing that excites public imagination
and arouses â¢ enthusiasm. Nevertheless it is a work
.vrhich patriotism has had to perform and which Gen
eral Otis has done with honor to himself and to his
flag. Let his reception then be worthy of his service
to the republic and of the city that has the honor to
.uckomc him. Let it be made clear to him that the
people of San Francisco have not given heed to the
.babblers :vho have found fault with everything, but
have noted his service under trying circumstances and
honor him for the office he holds, the work he has
done and the cause he represents.

_ DITOR TTIE CALLâ Dear Sir: It is
P| due to President Wheeler and to
Â§_*_ President Jordan, as well as to the
*Â¦" subject itself, that I should restate in
Â¦writing over my; name the proposi
tions I formulated In my speech at
St. Mary's College commencement. With
all the good will in the world a reporter
who gives a condensed account of an ad
dress must be responsible for some inac
curacies. The question of education is so
important and the movements which I
have criticized are so dangerous that I
may be pardoned for wishing to set forth
my arguments at greater length and In
more .precise form. We are face to face
with a very peculiar condition of educa
tional affairs, and it behooves every citi
zen of every class and of every creed to
give that condition his best attention.
In speaking to the graduating class of
St. Mary's College I stated that there
was a deliberate attempt making to create
a monopoly of education, in this State.
The arguments I used were founded on
the discussions as to the value of the
so-called smaller college as distinguished
from the so-called universities; on the
attitude of the State institution at Berke
ley to Catholics and on certain proposals
emanating from those who have at pres
ent control of the schools in the city and
countv of San Francisco. President
Wheeier and President. Jordan are mis
taken when they suppose that I am at
tacking the public school system or that
I am upholding education given under re
ligious auspices as - against education
given under purely secular auspices. This
Is another question altogether.' I have
said nothing about it. T intend to say
nothing about It. I am criticizing not the

State svstem of education, but the admin
istration of that system. To make such
criticisms I have as much right as Presi

any one else. _
As the subject is largo and complicated.

argument into three communications:

> Restatement of His Argument in His Address Before St. Mary's College Graduates, in Which
He Stated There "Was a Deliberate Attempt Making to Create a Monopoly
of Education in This State.
FATHER YORKE'S POSITION
ON THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION
"My feeling is strong that we are in danger when
this present war has passed by of forgetting its anx
iety and the lessons which it has taught us. It is for
you to struggle against that tendency and to urge
upon all whom you know the necessity of placing
ourselves in the position of an armed nation, such a
nation, for instance, as the Swiss are, where the
strength of the country is sought not in the bril
liancy of negotiations, not in its military organization,
but in the spirit of and the prepaiation of those who
love their country and are prepared to die for it.'.'
The British have for so long a time deemed their
island safe from invasion, since the navy is the strong
'est in Europe, that the serious warning from the
Prime Minister of a possible invading army has nat
urally caused no little agitation. It appears there is
now menacing the country a danger so great that the
navy cannot be relied upon as a sure protection
against it. That means, of course, a powerful coali
tion, for no one continental power could overcome
the British fleets that guard the channel. From what
source the menace comes Salisbury gave no intima
tion, but it is evident he was not speaking idly, but
from a sincere conviction that the British must pre
pare for war at close quarters and be ready to fight
for their homes at their very doors.
t Whether rifle clubs will be sufficient to fit a popu
lation to defend itself against an invasion by_a trained
European army may well be questioned. Any sug
gestion of universal military service, however, would
be rejected at once by the people, and the plan of
arming proposed is perhaps the only one that would
be received with favor. Moreover, there is to be said
in its favor that it would certainly increase the fighting
power of the people, and to that extent render inva
sion more dangerous and therefore less likely to be
undertaken. Salisbury's concluding words on the
subject were: ,
"Is it riot possible for the members of the Primrose
League, each in his own district, to do what he can
to foster the creation of t rifle clubs? And by rifle
clubs what I mean is rot clubs where a man must go
once in two months to the country town to take part
in a competition â that will do very little for the de
fense of the countryâ but what I want is that, without
stirring from their homes, the people of this country
shall be able to practice rifle shooting, so that when
the danger comes this shall be a force which no eneniy
could despise."
Salisbury was not bold enough to propose conscrip
tion or a general drilling of the whole male popula
tion of Hie British islands, as is done among the na
tions of continental Europe. He contented himself
with urging the^formation of rifle clubs through
which all classes of the people would, be taught to use
arms in defense of. the country should need be. He
is quoted as saying:
OF Lord Salisbury's recent speech before 'the
Primrose League the part which attracted the
most attention in Great Britain and most
deeply impressed the people there was that in which
he spoke of dangers threatening not only the em
pire.but the British Isles themselves, and emphatically
declared that the people must be armed and prepared
to resist invasion. Of, the attack on Ireland, which
was the salient feature of the speech from our point
of view, comparatively little notice has been taken bÂ£
the British press. A few words of condemnation of
the utterance, on the ground, of their injustice to Ire
land, were expressed on the day following the speech,
but' that portion of the address was then dismissed,
and ever since the discussion upon it has turned on
the warning of danger and the cry for -the arming of
the people.
TME ARMING OF GRE0T BRITAIN.
So far then as it is possible to keep the day sacred
to the memory of the heroic dead let it be done, and
let full honor be given also to the veterans who are
still among the living. This is the one day of the
year when the nation recalls their 'deeds and youth
13 impressed with the value of their service. It is a
day sacred to patriotism and to death, and the mean
ing and intent of it should not be lost to any loyal
heart. â
It is in some respects to be regretted that this
change should come over the minds of the people in
tTTeir attitude toward the observance of the day. An
occasion of solemn memories is one that it would
be well to cherish, and the heroic brave who fought
for their country merit such a national memorial as
long as the republic endures. In the very nature of
things, however, such a change is inevitable. Thanks
giving da}% designed as a religious festival, has al
most entirely lost thit significance to the greater part
of the people, but there is still a sufficient solemnity
in its celebration by the churches to keep its sig
nificance clear in the minds even of those who are
least heedful. So will it be with Memorial day.
There may be sports and games and a general re
joicing on this day, but evermore there will be
enough of dignity and patriotism in its chief obser
vances to remind the public of the object of its insti
tution and recall the memory of the Grand Army
and all that it did for the nation and for humanity.
When the day was first set apart for celebration it
was observed wholly as an occasion . for solemn
mourning and remembrance. At that time the mem
ory of the dead was to fresh in every household that
the sense of loss was greater than the sense 'of vic
tory- With the .years, however, there has come a
consciousness of the glory and the Â¦ good resulting
fiom the triumph of the armies of the Union, and ac
cordingly the day is becoming more and more .1
festival for rejoicing. The members of the Grand
Army continue to mourn the loss and recall the
memories of their departed comrades, but by the peo
ple at larp;e the celebration of the day is beginning to
be regarded rather as an honor to patriotism dis
played in battle than an occasion for grieving over
the fallen, and accordingly to a considerable extent
the day will be observed as a holiday hardly more
solemn than any other which marks some notable
feature in the history of the republic. . â¢
A\EMORIAL D0Y.
WITH memories whose tenderness is undimin
ished by the passage of time, and with a grati
tude augmented by the increasing proofs of
the supreme value of their service to the republic, the
people of the United States will to-day do honor to
I the patriots who on land and sea upheld the flag and
| the cause of the nation in that long and hard fought
I war that freed the slave and kept the Union whole.
! Upon the graves of the dead fiowprs will be strewn,
j and yet it will not be to them alone tht hearts of the
j people will do reverence to-day, for the surviving
! veterans of the Grand Army, now so rapidly thinning
| in its ranks, will be hailed with loyalty, and to the
living and the dead alike the honors of a grateful
' people will be given in unstinted measure.

traits that were to continue throughout
h!s work. The first was what we may
call his radicalism. In the preface to the
"Chimes" he declared it hi3 wish and
hope "to strike a blow for the poor. "
And this purpose runs through nearly all
his wcrk after "Pickwick." He is an ad
vocate pleading at the bar of the English
nation the cause of those who were suf
fering under the conditions of the time.
Dickens was by no neans a democrat.
He declared that '.e had infinitesimal
faith in the people governing and illimit
able fatth in the people governed. But
he was a. reformer of the old school,
practical, energetic, sympathizing deeply
with every form of social distress, hating
intensely every form of social oppression.
With Dickens the heart was always de
veloped at the expenss of the head, and
we rind in his work no underlying Ideas
of social reform. He attacked existing
abuses and demanded their lmmedlato
abolition, but he offered no substitute ex
cept such as might be found in the per
sonal activity of such men aa the
Cheeryble brothers or the reformed
Scrooge. In "Oliver Twist" Dickens de
nounced the whole English system of or
ganized charity, detestable to him for its
neglect of the human element and Its
exaggeration of method and machinery,
and in Bumble he has pilloried for all
time the representative of this system.
Naturally enough a note of exaggeration,
heard here for th#Â» first time, runs
through all this work of Dickens. A re
former is not apt to be distinguished for
his Impartiality. And" when a reformer 13
also a satirist, with a marked turn for
caricature, when his favorite method
of attack Is to make an abuse
so ridiculous that men will laugh it out
of existence, there can be no question of
photographic realism. There is a
sense, indeed. In which Dickens Is a re
alist, but his realism never stood in tha
way of his love for reform.
The second trait which appears in thl3
book is a distinct tendency toward the
theatrical, even the melodramatic. Dick
ens was from his youth a passionate lover
of the stage. While a lawyer's clerk he
spent evening after evening in the pit.
Later he actually proposed to go upon the
stage, and wa3 apparently prevented
from making the trial only by an acci
dent. In middle life he found his chief
delight In amateur theatricals, and of his
famous readings Carlyle said: "He is a
Â¦whole tragic, comic, heroic theater visi
ble." In the most effective of these read-
Ings. "The Death of Nancy." he rose to
the full height of tragic melodrama. In
evitably this tendency of his nature in
fluenced his work, and It cannot be said
to have Influenced it for good. It filled his
books with figures that belong upon the
boards rather than In real life or serious
artâ the stage villain (Monks in "OUrer
Twist" Is the earliest and crudest speci
men of this type>. the distressed damsel,
the Injured heir and the long-lost child.
It led him at times to disregard consist
ency of character and probability of ac
tion. Oliver himself, for example. Is a
quite impossible character, and the coinci
dences of hfs career are simply Incredible.
It caused him to indulge in an even
handed distribution of reward and pun
ishment, such as Is seldom met with In
this poor world. And finally,, and wor3t
of all. It pushed his reaJ 9zns+~ot pathos
Into a sentimentality that sometimes bor
ders upon the maudlin. The death of lit
tle Nell reminds us too strongly of the
last gasps and subsequent apotheoses of
the hundreds of little Eva* who go barn
storming through the land.
"Oliver Twist" Is In a sense a criminal
romance; but it is elevated far above thÂ«
common run of such stories by th9
writer's championship of virtue.
"1 had read of thieves by the score."
says Dickens in the preface to this novel,
"seductive fellows (amiable for the- most
parti â¢'â¢-â¢ and fit companions ror tha
bravest. But I had never met (except In
Hogarth> with the miserable reality. It
appeared to m* that to draw a knot o!
such associates in crime as really do ex
ist, to paint .them In all thetr deformity,
in all their wretchedness, in all the squalid
poverty of their lives. â¢ â¢ â¢ forever
skulking uneasily through the dirtiest
paths of life, with the great black, ghastly
gallows closing up their prospect: â¢ â¢ â¢
it appeared to me that to do this would be
â¢ â¢ â¢ a service to society. And there
fore I did it as best I could."
These sound, of course, like the words
of an uncompromising realist, and Dickens
was never that. Even in his attempt to
show the revolting nature of crime by
painting !t in Its true colors he used tha
artist's privilege of selection and" sup
pression. The language, for example, of
his thieves and vagabond Is purely fic
titious, and the thoroughgoing optimism
of his nature led him to dwell with delight
upon the soul of goodness In things evil
and to set the truth and pity of the
wretched Nancy shining like a star
against thÂ«Â» gloomy background of a Fa
gfn and a Sykes.
Noteâ This study wiU be concluded to
morrow.
All this was excellent training, but now
his ren 1 work was to begin. His first
story, "Mr. Minns and His Cousin." sub
mitted with fear and trembling and Joy
fully wept over when it appeared in all
the trlorv of print, came out In the old
Monthlv"Magazine In 1S3I. It was followed
by a number of tales and sketches in this
periodical and in the Evening Chronicle.
These are the now famous "Sketches by
Boz '" They brought him at first little
money and a very slight Increase of rep
utation, but as we look back we see In
them the whole of Dickens lying unde
veloped as the oak within the acorn. Here
is his wonderful â¢ microscopic ' observation
of life, hla rollicking flow of animal spir
it^ his hatred of social sham, and official
formalism, his sympathy with the poor
and afflicted, his sentiment, his pathos
and his humor. One thing alone was
lacking-his power of characterization.
Xo personage of these sketches had vital
ity enough to win a place among the lm
â¢mortal characters of fiction. But thi3 Is
due to the limitations of space: breathing
room is needed for the development of a
Sam "Weller. a Pecksniff or a Micawber.
In his next work Dickens securpd the
necessary space. The "Pickwick Papers."
as all the world knows, were originally
designed as the letterpress for a series of
pictures ridiculing the cockney sportsmen.
But the genius of Dickens asserted itself,
and even before the artist's death the
pictures had* sunk to the second place. On
the other hand, the characters which
His Tirst Publications.
The early life and associations of
Charles Dickens were well litted to bring
him into touch with the realities of ex
istence and to cpen his eyes to the lights
and shadows ot the great actual world
that lay waiting to be revealed In art.
He was the second child of a poor gen
tleman in the Navy Pay Office, the proto
type of Micawber, always in financial dis
tress, alwavs hopeful that something
would turn up. His mother, apparently a'
faded beauty of the Mrs. NIckleby type,
struggled in vain against the accumulat
ing troubles of the family. The crash
came at la.Â«Â»t and the whole household
with the exception of the two elder child
ren, who were otherwise provided for,
sought shelter from the duns behind the
waits of the Marshal3ea.
In the few happy years of h!s
earlier childhood DicKens had been. In his
own words, a very queer small boy, quick,
eager, delicate, and soon hurt physically
or mentally. He took no part in the
sports of his boy friends, but read for
hours, filling his head with the novels of
the last century. "Roderick Random" and
'â¢Tom Jones" and '"Robinson Crusoe" and
the "Vicar of Wakefleld." But with his
father's imprisonment the little man of
12 years was launched upon the world of
London. A place in a cousin's blacking
factory was secured for him with a wage
of six shillings a week, and he was left to
shift for himself. Every Sunday, indeed,
he visited his parents, but for six days of
the week he was alone in'London, hungry,
ill clothed and nncared for. Strangest of
all. his parents appeared .quite satisfied.
"They could hardly have been more so,"
said "Dickens years after, "if I had been
20 years of age. distinguished at a gram
mar school and going to Cambridge. 1 ' Re
lease came, however: the doors "of the
prison opened, a legacy fell in and the boy
got a few years of very old-fashioned
schooling, from which he passed on with
a smattering of Latin and a very thor
ough knowledge of the schoolboy heart
and of the manners ana customs of
schoolmasters. ,
His next step was into a lawyer s ofSce,
but he had neither the money nor the
hacking to pursue the law. Again ha
moved on. bearing with him an unparal
leled knowledge of the legal world. He
became a reporter, raised himself by in
defatigable labor to a certain reputation
as one of the very best stenographers of
his day. and plunged into the world of
journalism. He wrote on his knees in the
gallery of the House of Commons, on his
feet In a "preposterous pen In the House
of Lords" andâ this was before the days
of the telegraphâ dashed madly over the
country to attend elections, report ad
dresses and carry his notes back to the
press in London. He once said:
"I do verily believe I have been upsÂ«-t
in almost every description of vehicle
known in this country. I have been be
lated in miry byroads in the small hours,
forty or fifty miles from London, with ex
hausted horses and drunken postboys and
have got back in time for publication."
Again a new world of the hustings, the
country inns and the vanished race of
coachmen and postilions, which he was to
immortalize in nis novels.
Dickens' Early Life.
Egan. English fiction as a whole had
lost its grasp on life and gone astray after
false gods. The great achievement of
Dickens was to recall the art to Its true
domain and by the force of his fiin, his
sentiment and his power of character por
trayal to give it a hold upon the hearts
of the public such as earlier novelists had
never ureamed of.

islands should have become a settled fact.

XXIIL THE GOLDEN AGE OF
ENGLISH FICTION.
BY THOMAS MARC PARROTT. PH.D.
The art of fiction had fallen very low In
England when Charle3 Dickens appeared
upon the scene. Scotfs enormous success
with the historical novel had given a j
great impulse to the production of ro- !
mantle fiction. The old realism of Field- !
ing and Smollett was 'submerged in a
flood of pseudo romances. Action took
the place of character and a more or Jess j
exciting story deafened the reader to the
creaking of the puppet's springs. If an
appeal was made to his sympathies it
was either for some charming devil of a
criminal or. for some fashionably cynical
dandy. Such were the works of Ains
worth and G. P. R- James, and the ear
lier novels of Bulwer and Disraeli. Hu
mor, too. had departed along with the
realism to which it clings and Its place
had been usurped by the coarse and bois
terous farce of Theodore Hook and Pierca
Dlcltens had created grew and shapeA
themselves in his hand?, and the series of
comic sketches bÂ«car2e the book we all
know.
"Pickwick" is not a novel. It is one of
the great unclassified books of EnpliSh
literature. It has. of course, reminis
cences .of the older novelist-*, of Smollett
in particular, but how much cleaner and
sweeter is its fun! There is practically no
plot; the circumstances of composition
forbade any preconceived design on the
author's part. But It has what Is better
than the best plot ever plannedâ life. Ex
aggerated, grotesque even, the characters
may be, but they are alive. Mr. Pick
wick and hi3 friends. Bob Sawyer. Sam
IVeller, the shepherd and the inimitable*
Jingle, all strike root in reality. And in
the closing scenes there is an earnestness
of tone, a sobriety of treatment, and
above all. an Invincible optimism, a pre
revolutionary belief in the perfectibility
of mankind, that reveal the real Dickens
in all his power.
His First Novel.
"Oliver Twist" is Dickens' first novel,
and we find in it fully developed two

EASTERN MARKETS.
TO ARRIVE.
CHICAGO. May 2?.â Wheat opened firm, July
a shade over yesterday at 67c to 66"4c on the
strength of cables, Liverpool quoting futures
*;d higher and Paris reporting an advance of
lc per bushel. The flrmneBS was of short
duration, for the Northwest reported moder
ate rains, with a prospect of more of the
same needed article, while Budapest and Ber
lin were weak. These considerations c^*nt July
down to C6%c. The crop news from all winter
wheat sectionsâ Kansas and the adjoining re-
Klors in the Southwest exceptedâ were of the
moFt glowing character. The Indian ctrop was
eaid to be threatened with almost total de
struction and the Ohio reports were nearly as
gloomy. Later in the day shorts covered on
reports of drought and cold weather In France
and because of the unfavorable domestic re
ports aforementioned. In this way most of
the wheat sold early was repurchased and Julv
rallied to 67^Â»c, closing firm. HÂ®'/ic over yeo"
terday at 67Vic. The strength developed bl
oom was also a support.
There was a large Jocal trade In torn and
prices were higher. Cables were higher, the
weather was considered too wet. country ac
ceptances were Email and there was an Im
provement in the cash business. July closed
flrni, ViÂ°yHc over yesterday at 37H@37*4c
Oats were quiet but firm under leadership
of corn and because of a fair cash demand
July closed a shade over yesterday at 21Uc
Trade In provisions wasi of a very quiet
order, but prices were well maintained as
there was a good shipping demand. The list
opened a shade lower and after fluctuating
within very narrow limits closed steady, Julv
perk 2%c lower, lard unchanged and rlbe 'Uc
higher.
There will be no session of the Board of
Trade to-morrow. Memorial day.

creased to a matter of 8 to 10 points, while
later In the session another spell of weakness

The American Wool and Cotton Re
porter will say Thursday: There . Is still
no improvement to be noted In the condi
tion of the wool market. In fact, the dull
ness previously noted has been Intensified, with
the market In as nearly a state of complete
staznatlon as It is possible to conceive It.
The mills are pursuing the strictly hand-to
mouth Dollcy in the purchasing of wocl, be
cause of the quietness of the goods trade and
the uncertainty as to the style of goods which
will be In demand for the coming lightweight
season. In the Territories stiff prices are being
paid for the new wools when there Is any busi
ness done, but jrrowers' Ideas as a whole are
considerably above the ideas of Eastern pur
chasers.

0AKL-\ND. May 29.â That pretty Rose James might not go through life with a horribly disfigured countenance, she
has pa-Â«?ed successfully through one of the most remarkable skin-grafting operations of record In the public
work of the Oakland Receiving Hospital staff of surgeons.
Four weeks ago the young woman waa taken to the hospital in an. apparently dying condition. During a trol
ley party of Maccabees Miss James, while standing on the step of one car. was struck by a car approaching from the
opposite direction. The girl was thrown, headlong, with much violence through a car window. Her face was cut Into
shreds. Her right cheek was torn out of her face, and this portion of flesh was found the following day on the street
Car floor.
By desperate work of the surgeons the young woman's life was saved. But the injuries were such that unless
heroic methods were used, her face must have healed under most distressing circumstances. -The flesh would have
been contracted, and would have twlated the injured right side Into a wretched disfigurement. The surgeons found
only one way to meet the situation. They decided to transplant or graft new skin upon the ugly wounds.
The skin of the under side of the right arm was selected for the operation. By delicate surgical work the skin of
the arm was lapped upon the wounded cheek, and after proper adjustment the arm was set rigidly upon the face
In a plaster cast. ThVre it remained immovable for nine days. When It was removed yesterday the operation was
found to have been a signal success. The new tissue had been absorbed by the wound, and within a few weeks, the
surgeons say, the healing process will be complete. The girl's features will be impaired slightly by a small scar,
where the sutures were, but even thesa will disappear in time. There will be barely a trace of the ugly and extensive
wound she suffered.
To accomplish thi3 remarkable result sixteen square inches of skin and tissue were removed from the arm and trans
planted upon the cheek. The girl suffered Intensely at times during the period of grafting, but she had the constant
care of Hospital Steward Brochert, and Miss Hull, a trained nurse, has also been in constant attendance, and they
did much to relieve her pain. Â¦ - Â¦
The case from a surgical point of view was unusually interesting. In that so large a surface was covered. The or
dinary skin-grafting. operation of taking small pieces from various. portions of the body would avail in this case
because of the nature of the wound and the difficulty to be overcome, the main purpose being to leave as slight
record of the Injury 33 possible. The wound caused by the removal of the skin from the arm is healing as success
fully as that upon rhe face. ... . . psÂ£|Sl|3lS|j|9^gtf&
The operation was conducted by Dr. "William 8. Porter, assisted by Dr. R. T. Stratton. Dr. J. L. Milton, president
of the Alameda County Medical Society; Dr. Charles Rowe, Dr. E. N. Ewer and Dr. Sanborn.

MRS. SLiCER SCORES A
POINT IN DAMAGE SUIT
OAKLAND, May Â».â Judge Hall has
overruled thÂ» demurrers of all the de
fer.dant* except John R. Tregloan in the
damage suit of Cera E. Slicer and others
against the Alameda Macadamizing Cora
jiÂ«ny. The suit was brought several
months ago, the plaintiffs alleging fraud
on the part of the directors of thÂ» macad
amizing company. It was claimed that
darrases to the amount cf $32,000 were
sustained by reason of the directors ap
propriating money to form the Bay Reck
Company; that $30 /Â«*) damages were sus

Seattle will be the next meeting place of
the Congregational Congress of the Pa
cific Coast. This was the decision of the
congress before its adjournment this
afternoon. A committee of four â Rev.
H. H. Wyckoff of San Francisco. Rev. C.
B. Sumner of Los Angeles, Rev. A. W.
Ackerman of Portland, Or., and Rev. J. F.
Nichols of Seattle â was appointed to per
fect arrangements for the session to be
held at Seattle three years hence. .
The closing exercises were held this after
noon in the First Congregational Church.
The Rev. Jonathan Edwards of Spokane,
an eloquent speaker and a student of
sociology, delivered an able addross on
"Among- Ourselves," which was one of a
series under the general topic of "Cul
tivation of. Fellowship." He was follow
ed by the Rev. Alfred Bayley, formerly of
Oakland, who took for the subject of his
discourse "With Other Christians."
"Benevolent Activities" was discussed
by the Rav. Philip Coombe of San Fran
cisco, who paid that in his opinion the
church was not eiven full credit for all
its benevolent enterprises. His plea waÂ»
for better organization.
The Kev. E. L. Smith of Seattle read a
well-written paper on the subject of
"Special Work for Men." He analyzed
the causes contributing to the small pro
portionate attendance of the men In
churches. One of the principal reasons
for this state of affairs was the great
number of men's clubs and fraternal or
ganizations. Then there was the deterio
ration In ministerial standards. This, the
speaker felt, was largely due to the fact
that men have ceased to feel that the
churches can offer them anything serious
ly needed. Another thing contributing to
the apathy of men toward the church was
the tremendous Influence of the daily pa
per Because of the dally paper, he said,
the layman was as well if not better In
formed than his pastor.
Owing to Illness the Rev. J. F. Davies of
San Francisco, who was to have read an
important paper, was unable to be pres
ent.

As reasons for their action the mill
workers declare that the Millmen's Union

lution: that outside carpenters work but
eight hours a day, and that millmen are
the only men in the building trades who
work longer than that. Both the Oakland

With regard to ocean and lake surveys
the House refused any appropriation for
surveys by the navy and tied up the con
ferees with instructions. It also refused
to concur in the Senate amendment to
abolish the two years' sea criiise for naval
cadets. With this action the naval bill
was sent back to conference, the confer
ence report on the other items having
been agreed to. The conference report on
the postofilce appropriation bill agreeing
on all items except the Senate amendment
appropriating $Â£25,000 for pneumatic tube
service, was adopted and the House then
concurred in the excepted amendment.
The opponents of the extended service in
the House reconciled their concurrence la
this action upon the ground that the
S225.000 simply carried out the existing
contract. The bill now goes to the Presi
dent. . '"- - : Â¦-â¢ ~ Â¦'-"'' -
That the Secretary of the Navy is hereby
authorized to procure by contract armor of the
best quality tor any or all vessels whatever
referred to, provided such contracts can be
made at a 'price which In his Judgment is
reasonable and equitable; but in case he is
unable to make contracts for armor under the
above conditions he is hereby authorized, in
his discretion, to procure a site for and to
erect thereon a factory for the manufacture of
armor, and the sum of $4,000,000 is hereby ap
propriated toward the erection of said factory.
The House to-day by a vote of 107 :o
124 refused to accept the Senate amend
ment to the naval appropriation bill re
lating to armor plate and adopted a mod
ified proposition reading as follows:
House Action. on Armor Plate.
Fairbanks of Indiana endeavored to se
cure consideration of the bill providing
for the extradition of criminals from the
United States to Cuba, but Allison de
clined to lay aside the appropriation bill
for that purpose.

WASHINGTON, May 29.â A few minutes
before* adjournment this evening the Sen
ate added to the sundry civil appropria
tion bill an amendment appropriating
55,000,000 for the Louisiana purchase ex
position to be held at St. Louis In 1903, on
condition that $10,000,000 in be
raised by the exposition' authorities. ..The
amendment was offered by Cockrell of
Missouri and was adopted without debate
and without division. Because an amend
ment offered by.Gallinger of New Hamp
shire subsequently was stricken out on a
point of order Gallinger moved to recon
sider the St. Louis fair amendment, and
that motion is now pending. As it Is
known that a considerable majority of the
Senate favors the fair amendment it
seems reasonably likely that the motion
to reconsider will not be adopted.
The committee amendment to the para
graph relating to the enforcement of the
contract labor law and the Chinese exclu-
Bion act was so modified as to read that
the enforcement of these laws should be
"under the supervision and control of the
Secretary of the* Treasury." As thus
modified the amendment was agreed to.
Bacon of Georgia addressed the Senate
at length on the Teller .resolution ex
pressing sympathy . for the Boers, after
which the resolution was referred to the
Committee oh-' Foreign Relations by a
vote of 40 to 26, as follows:
Resolution Expressing Sympathy for
Boers Referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Re
lations.

The Park Commissioners may evade the
spirit and meaning of the charter by
holding executive sessions, but if they fol
low the example given last night they will
surely forfeit the confidence of the people.
No good was ever accomplished by secret
methods of dealing with public business.
The subject was discussed In all Its re
lations to Golden Gate Park, the public
and the Free library. The unanimous
conclusion was reached that the proposed
scheme was* impracticable. Reference
was made to the fact that space Is re
quired at the Park .Lodge for maps and
records of the commission; that office
room is required *>y the secretary and
bookkeeper; that a meeting room for the
use of the board Is necessary, and that
facilities for weighing and receiving sup
plies should be maintained. No good rea
son was presented for the establishment
of a branch of the Public Library in
Golden Gate Park, hence it was the sense
of the meeting that the existing order
of things should not bu disturbed.
Mayor Phelan's desire for star chamber
proceedings can be readily explained. He
is opposed to public light on general prin
ciples. Tho example of the Park Com
mission In going Into, secret session for
the transaction of public business Is re
grettable. The trust committed to the
management of the Park Commissioners
is enc in which all of the people of San
Francisco are concerned. It is absurd to
conceal from the public anything that re
lates to the proposed embellishment. Im
provement or management of. Golden
Gate Park. The charter contemplates
that public business shall be openly con
ducted.
The only board that is permitted to hold
secret sessions is the Board of Police
Commissioners. Even the Board of
Health recognized the charter require
ment for open sessions and In order to
evade the law adopted the plan of com
mittee reference and provided that the
committee should consist of the entire
board.
The meeting was called to consider
Mayor Phelan's proposition to convert the
Park lodge into a branch" of the Free Pub
lic Library.
Mayor Phelan attended the meeting and
objected to the presence of newspaper
representatives. Thereupon Commissioner
Zeile moved that the board go into execu
tive session, and the motion prevailed.
The Board of Park Commissioners, con
sisting of A. B. Spreckels (president),
Rueben H. Lloyd, Jasper McDonald, F.
"W. Zeile and John A. Stanton, met in the
red room of the Bohemian Club last even-
Ing. The board was In session from 8 un
til 11 o'clock.
Matter Was Discussed for Three
Hours in Secret Session, the
Mayor Being Opposed to
Publicity.
Commissioners Decided That
They Cannot Spare the
Lodge.

morning-. Brod wan before Judge Fritz on

ing for the past three weeks In a stable
at Eighteenth street and Treat avenue,
and had bfen several times ordered away
by the policeman on the beat. Early yes
terday morning Policeman Finnelly ar
rested him.
P>rod seemed to bo proud of his re
semblance to the immortal William, and
showed great familiarity with the lines in
The Judge tried several times to inter
rupt the old man, and when tbe latter
paused for want of breath told him that
"To be. or not to be: that is the ques
tion," shouted Brod, as he waved his
arms ?.round. "Whether 'tis nobler in the
mind to suffer the pangs of hunger and
sleep on a bed of straw than to beg a
dime for bread and sleep in a cheap lodg
ing-house. I have .suffered the slings and
arrows of outraged fortune, but have al
ways been^an honorable man. . Give me
my liberty or give me death."
"Hamlet." Why am I arrested?" he de
manded In a loud voice. "Is poverty a
crime? I am a law-abiding citizen and
demand my rights." The Judge told him
he was arrested because he had no visible
means of support.
Shakespeare appeared before Judge Slo
gan on a charge of intoxication. He was
found staggering along Kearny street
Monday night by Policeman Connor. He
had no occupation and did not know that
such a person as his famous namesake
hatl ever existed. The Judge told him that
a man with such a name should try to do
something to <arn an honorable living,
and discharged him.
he must spend the next ten days in the
County Jail.
"Most potent, grave and reverend selg
nor," .said the old man. "I do protest
against this foul outrage."
"Thou dost' protest too much." retorted
the Judge. "Away with him." And the
old man, with his head bowed down, was
led gently away by Bailiff Conlon.
