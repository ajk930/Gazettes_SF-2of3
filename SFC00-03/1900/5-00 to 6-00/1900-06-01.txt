ROSSLYITS STOBY CONFIBMED.
Murders of Christians.
LONDON, June 1.â The Peking corre
spondent of the Time3. telegraphing
Wednesday, says :
"The damage to the railroad Is estimated
at Â£30,000. The Government supports
rather than condemns the Boxers. Not
one has been arrested yet. No foreigner
has been seriously Injured, though mur
ders of native" Christians are reported
daily from the country."
Count Casslnl. the Russian Embassador.
who is leaving the United States for a
visit to Europe, and called to say good-by
to Secretary Hay, is decidedly of the
opinion that much unwarranted anxiety
has been excited as to the action of the
Boxers. He feel3 confident that there la
little dancer to the life and property ot
foreigners in China to be expected from
the present uprising. There are, of course,
he admits, always disorderly elements In
a great city like Peking quick to take
advantage of any excitement, so that It
was probably wise precaution on the part
of foreign Ministers resident In the capital
to call for guards for their respective, le-'
gations, the presence of these small but
splendid organizations having a whole
some effect upon the would-be turbulent
elements In Peking.
Mr. Xabeshlma, Charge of the Japanese
legation, who also was among Secretary
Hay's callers, -was likewise disposed to
minimize the dancer of the Boxer upris
ing. He pointed out that at all times In
Chinese history the secret societies are
fomenting trouble, and the present dis
turbance, growing out of the operations of
the Boxers, was not. he said, nearly so
formidable as the preceding ones.
which has been done before by them, the
marines can cover it in about three days,
unless their march is opposed.
Diplomats Are Interested.
The Chinese Minister, Wu Tins Fang,
called at the State Department at an
early hour to-day to talk with Secretary
Hay. He had no Information from hl3
own Government as to the critical situa
tion in China and was anxious for news.
Resident representatives of nearly all
nations represented in the Chinese situa
tion were among Secretary Hay's callers
to-day; but. as In the case of the Chinese
Minister, none of them had received any
Information from hl3 own Government
bearing upon the situation.
Admiral Kempff Reports.
WASHINGTON, May 31.â The following
cablegram has been received at the Navy
Department from the senior squadron
commander. Admiral Kempff:
"TUNGKU, May 30.â One hundred men
landed and went to Tientsin yesterday.
Fifty of these go to Peking to-day. Other
nations also landed men. KEMPFF."
Although Admiral Kempff "s cablegram
Is dated yesterday, the Navy Department
officials are confident that the American
marines have cone forward to Peking,
even though the Russian forces may have
been detained at Tientsin by the technical
opposition of the Chinese authorities. The
very "â¢ smallness of the force which the
admiral Is sending at Minister Conger's
request would. It Is felt, facilitate its ad
mission to the . Chinese capital, for It
could not be regarded by the Chinese Gov
ernment as a menace to Chinese integrity.
The admiral's dispatch indicates, that he
has not been able to take the flagship
Newark up the Pelho River beyond the
Taku forts, just above the entrance. From
that point to Tientsin, which stands at
the head of light-draught navigation and
is the terminus nearest the sea of the rail
road to Peking, is a distance of about
thirty-five or forty miles. It is said at
the Navy Department that the American
marines were probably towed In â¢ small
beats by "the Newark's launches up the
river to this rayroad connection. From
Tientsin to Peking by rail is a distance of
seventy. miles, a three-hour Journey, ac
cording to Chinese schedules.
If obliged to make the distance on foot.
Tsingtau has orders to act In conjunction
with the naval authorities of the other
powers as circumstances may require.
The landing of men at Taku to go to Pe
king was "ordered. The "report from the
United States that 20,000 Russians are ad
vancing to help the Chinese Is baseless.
No power is sustaining China. We know
that Russia will not separate herself from
the others."
A cable arrived to-day, fgrom Tsingtau
saying that the German cruiser Kalserln
Augusta, having taken on board. an addi
tional officer and fifty marines, sailed for
Taku, the German gunboat Iltls following.
. German naval officials, it is understood,
consider It Important to land large forces
In China, as despite the recent disap
proval of the Boxers by the Peking Gov
ernment the present small contingents are
Insufficient to awe the insurgents. In this
matter, however, the Foreign Office does
not agree with the Naval Department.
LONDON, June 1.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Dally Mail says: "The
German Government takes a serious view
of the situation in China, The powers are
resolved . on armed intervention."

BOER ENVOYS SAY ROBERTS
MY YET RUN INTO A TRAP
BOSTON, May 31.â Messrs. Fischer. Wessels and Wolmarans. the Boer en
voys, were received at the City Hall here tc-day by Mayor Hart 'and sub- 1
sequently called at the State House. The Mayor alluded to the day's news
from South Africa, and hoped that the adversity sustained by the Boers
might be for the best. Mr. Fischer responded, affirming that all he and" his
compatriots wished for was justice. The envoys- did not seem greatly .depressed Â¦
by the news from Johannesburg and Preto'ria. Chairman Fischer, whenever op
portunity gave, did not fail to reiterate the statement that the war is by no
means ended. â¢ .
"Have you noticed," he asked a reporter, "that the English forces have not
captured a single piece of artillery or any considerable munitions of war from
us since our men have heen executing their retreat? This material has not as
cended into the air. nor has it gone up in Lord Roberts' balloons, and the Eng
lish will find It out to their sorrow, I am afraid. Our grins, supplies, etc., have
been taken along with our troops, and they will yet be used effectively, if I
am not greatly mlstaken. ; The fact that President Kruger has retreated to "Wa
tervalboven and that this is declared the capital; of our government shows that
our people are still determined to win their Independence. Our capital Is where Â¦
our President chooses to move It. The fact that Lord Roberts annexed the.
Orange Free State the other day means nothing." The United States could annex
Canada by proclamation, but Bomethlng more effective would have to follow to
make It a fact."
Mr. Fischer added the statement that" President Kruger would not surrender
while there was a bullock cart and sixteen oxen in the Transvaal to transport
him from place to place.
Mr. Wessels expressed much the same opinion as Mr. , Fischer, but he said
that, he looked upon the late news from South Africa with some suspicion. He
said that if President Kruger had been going to surrender he would have re
mained in the city, while the Boers would not have carried away their guns
and ammunition if they had Intended to capitulate. Roberts, he sa!d, may. yet
ran into a nice trap.

Boer Government Shifted.
The present seat of the Boer Govern
ment, according to a dispatch from Lour
enzo Marques dated yesterday, is Middles

th The C lfoArs lately confronting Lord Rob
erts appear to have gone toward the
Lydenbur* region. The . d efend< .rs of

too pfTillous, will probably trek straight
northward toward Lydcnburg. W htn
this concentration takes place there will
possibly be 20*00 men. who may hold out
for a time, with scattered bands of gueril
las elsewhere. The press dispatches from
the headquarters of Lord Roberts give no
estimate as to the number of Boers who
were fighting General French and General
Ian Hamilton Monday and Tuesday, but
they all agree that the Boers retired and
that the IJritish casualties were slight.
At noon yesterday, according to the dispatches, the British commander made his entry into Jo
hannesburg 1 in full state. The above picture from the Sphere shows a similar, ceremony at "Bloemfonteih.
LONEON, May 31. â The following dispatch from Lord Koberts has, been received at the "War

, â¢ It is rumored that foreign troops will be opposed at â¢ the first gate of the
Chinese capital, outside the wall.
As the Russians were nearing the forts yesterday in boats the Chinese
opened fire and the Russians retreated. It now appears that the Chinese were only
firing a gun salute in honor of a mandarin who was on board a Chinese war
ship.
PEEKING, May 31.â At 2:30 a. m. to-day the foreign envoys received the

It is here that the American sailors, with those from other foreign war vessels, who were landed
for the protection of the legations in Feking, have been stopped by order of tha Viceroy of Pechili.activity of the health authorities means
nothing of the sort. It simply means
that the people of San Francisco,
through their officials, have awakened
to the startling fact that they have a
plague spot in their midst and that it
must be .removed whatever the cost
may be.
The quarantine was maintained yes
terday far more rigorously than it was
the day before. The detail of police
was doubled and no one was permitted
to enter the district and leave it with
out . submitting to inoculation. The
health inspectors are' conducting a thor
ough investigation and removing tons
of refuse and filth, which will be burned.
A gigantic sulphur fumigator is being
used in the district in a house-to-house
inspection. It is the purpose of the au
thorities to establish a detention hos
pital on Mission Rock for all persons
who may be found in infected houses,
and it may be that if another case of
the" disease is found the infected struc
tures will be destroyed. United States
Census Marshals will be allowed to en
ter the district, but they must first sub
mit to inoculation.
The local Health Board held a meet
ing yesterday and discussed the vitally
important matter of providing food for
the people in the district. Nothing defi
nite was done, as the question must be
submitted to the Board of Supervisors.
SISTER STATES HAVE
NO REASON FOR FEAR
Dr. Shrady Declares That Plague Is
Practically Not Here, but China
town Is a Grave Menace.
Copyrljtht. 1?00. by the H?ra!<5 Publishing
Company.
N3 llvÂ«ne case of plague yet seen in
San Francisco. From my point of
view, being a mere visitor here^this
condition of things is somewhat dif
ficult to explain. In this state of mini the
the truth is searched for, the better for
the truth. There is no disposition,. so far
as I can see, either on tne part of tho
federal or the local health authorities, to
dispute the right of any' competent'medi
cal gentleman expressing his opinion upon
the situation or the significance of the
revelations from the- specimens.
Now, as to the autopsy proper, it Is well
to say in a general- way that nothing spe
cially significant of plague was discovered
in the gross appearances of the organs
removed. Awaiting further developments
I shall report later.
.From what I had heard of the.opposi
tion of Chinese to the post-mortem exam
inations, it was hardly a surprising fjLct
to me that an objection was made on the
part of the father. The Chinese are very
superstitious in regard to mutilation of
the body and look upon It as a desecra
tion. One Chinaman informed me that it
was a bar to the future happiness of the
soul. ... . ...
San .--, Francisco Is . very r -. much con
cerned about the quarantine question, and
well she might-be. At best it is a difficult
problem to tackle. The are
most particularly anxious on the question,
as it. is easy to see that millions of. dol
lars are involved in its proper and prac
tical settlement. Texas has already quar
antined against San Francisco. In con
versing with Dr. Blunt, the health officer
of that commonwealth who came here
to look after the interests of his State, I
learned that the mere report of the prev
alence of plague in this city was enough
to. influence him to this radical/and, far
reaching measure. The fear on the part
of the people of San Francisco is that
other States, actuated: by like and what
appear to me -to be senseless fears, may.
also follow suit. The fact is every pre
caution has been taken at this end of the
line to guard against any; possible spread
of the disease. It might also be sald^that
the plague is not here. Where Is it? It
is only: the fact that the authorities here
are. straining a- point to be'on the right
side, and I can testify, to the; fact that so
far as the control of the flisease is con
cerned it is perfect here. There Is no
cause for alarm tin the part* of outsiders.
Chinatown is quarantined and that quar
antine is. for all practical purposes per
fect. The house-to-house inspection is be
ing- . conducted by . a large â¢ corps of . sani
tary Inspectors, the r sewers are being
flushed." houses fumigated and altogether
the whole matter. is as' weirin hand from
a sanitary point of view; as 'could reason
ably be desired. Â¦; : .'.'.Â¦ r
"Every -member of the Health Board' is
sufficiently alive .to the necessity of clean
ing up â¢ Chinatown. -, There has not been
made the first objection' to such a' move
Another story is to the effect that the
Chinamen are in the habit of burying
their dead beneath their houses and in the
various subterranean passages ; but this.
I am quite sure, is without any foundation
whatever, for reasons which will after
ward be stated. Certain it is that the in
habitants of Chinatown are afraid of the
white doctor, and especially are they in
terror of the members of the Health
Board. The Chinese physician is uned
ucated, irresponsible, and has no license to
practice; but in the vast hiajority of cases
this individual is almost universally em
ployed by his people.' These native medi
cine men are not 'obliged >by , any special
ordinance to report .suspicious cases to- the
health authorities and are certainly not
willing to do so. of their own. accord, for
obvious reasons. This partly explains the
fact that the first notice to the authori
ties of a suspicious case is ordinarih* em
phasized by asking permission to bury the
body. Then the Health Board takes \ the
matter in charge. It was in this way that
Dr. Wilson, the assistant city Â¦ physician,
discovered the cases already reported.
Now it appears to be the intention of
the Health Board to make an autopsy on
every body discovered. This does not en
tail any extraordinary, labor, -for I am in
formed that the mortality in Chinatown
is very low, in fact. Dr. Wilson informed
me the other day that there was only. an
average of about two deaths a day". This,
considering the population; is a very low
rate of mortality. In ' accordance with
this intention named there was ~ an' au
topsy made, on a child this morning by
Dr. Kellogg. Drs. Whitehousc. Kinyoun.
Wilson, myself and several other medical
men were present'. The child apparently
died without any definite diagnosis having
been made before death. The illness was
of a few day*' duration, the little patient
having been under the care of a Chinese
female physician until seen by an Ameri
can physician,. who was" in the employ of
the Six Companies, just ; before death.'
This autopsy was made in the Morgue In
the Chinese district. - After a long period
of waiting, word came thafthe father de
clined to have the body, removed from
the house to the Morgue and so vehement
were his expressions of disapproval that
at one time it" was- thought requisite to
.use Â¦ compulsion by the . police, but the
medical attendant of the patient referred
to succeeded in .reconciling the differ
ences, and the body was duly -produced
without any necessity -for calling out an
extra force, for such purpose.:
The Â¦ glands 'from the . groin had " been
already, removed by the attending physi
cian, for .the purpose of subsequent exam
ination. I may state in passing that there
is a great deal of- apparent oppositionÂ«to
the methods of procedure of the Health-
Board on the part of the different Chin
ese societies, each of which appears. to be
represented by a medical adviser, but
from a scientific point of. view the more
people in San Francisco very generally
share. They say if the plague is here why
is not a real live example of it shown to
us? One plausible reason for this condi
tion of. affairs is offered in the peculiar
habits of secrecy of the Chinese regarding
sickness and death among thoir numbers.
There Is a suspicion with some people
with whom I have conversed that cases
which might have occurred in the interim
between May 15 and yesterday have been
concealed and that there may be a reg
ular train of successive cases which have
not been regularly .reported. I hardly
think there is any foundation for this con
jecture, in view of the reasonably thor
ough house-to-house Inspection which has
been enforced by the Health Board.
Continued on Page Eight
on the part of any one of the citizens,
even of those who are loth to believe that
there is. any. necessity for so doing, merely
on account of the so-called plague situa
tion. The universal verdict is that China
town must be cleaned up. plague or no
plague... It seems to me that the recent
developments connected with the plague
scare have almcst been warranted in view
of the fact which now promises such a
desirable accomplishment in a district of
the city liable to breed disease at any
time. . ", ... , \ .
I think I have in -some descriptions of
tours in this district made it plain that
Chinatown is so notoriously filthy that al
most any superlative coukl fit such a con
dition. In different sections it has.differ
ent degrees of comparison in the down
grade of appalling dlsgustfulness. The
more you see of it'the more- you are im
pressed with the fact. The "heathen
Chinee" plays his game with dirt, and he
has not only afull hand.but carries his
traditional .extra - card In .his sleeve. He
washes for the Christian's because he is
willing to minister, td their' foolish whims.
In 'this way he fosters- his own personal
indifference to cleanliness in his. own
hovel.. The. worst of all is that he believes
he has an unquestioned prerogative in this
direction, and . stupidly ,and passively re
sists all missionary efforts to the contrary.
His person may appear clean enough, but
one would npt wish to run the risk of tak
ing pot luck with him in-his own quarters.
I Considering all things, it is a great won
der that plague ,or any other infectious
disease .has not swept Chinatown long ago
with a tidal wave of, the most awful mor
tality. All' things being equal it is not
unlikely that there may be a repetition of
recent unpleasant experiences. It is yet
a serious question Â¦whether or not we have
heard of tho last case from the recent in
vasion. 'Thrse are certainly serious con
siderations for San Francisco and for all
those who are directly' or indirectly con
nected with its vast mercantile and mari
time interests. â¢ She has In her very mklst

THE so-called plague situation in
this city has greatly simplified it
self and if there was the slightest
fear that San Francisco was. to become
the sufferer of an epidemic of the dread
disease the apprehension has passed
away. By common consent officials
local, State and Federalâ declare that
there is now not the slightest danger to
the people of the city or State. Dr.
George F. Shrady, who was induced to
come to the city at the instance of the
Xew York Herald and The Call, de
clares that it is almost safe to say that
the plague is not here. He urges, in
his fourth day's report, which is pub
lished this morning, that there is not
the remotest occasion for other cities
and States to fear San Francisco or to
construe from the vigorous measures
which are now being taken to cleanse
Chinatown that the authorities believe
that the plague is here or is threatening
the city with its reappearance.
Dr. Shrady is still in close communi
cation with the different health officials
und will remain so until his investiga
tion is ever. He congratulates the au
thorities upon the energy they have dis
played in quarantining Chinatown and
in displaying a desire to cleanse the filth
spot as effectively as possible. The
famous expert declares that the Chinese
quarter is filthy to a degree almost baf
fiing description, and that as long as it
remains it will exist as a menace of the
most serious character to the people of
the city.
He suggests the most radical meas
cres to remove the dangers existing in
'.he district, and says that if Chinatown
is permitted to remain as it is it will
be for San Francisco a blight and a
disgrace which inevitably will harm the
city.
In his report Dr. Shrady asks other
States not to look .upon the rigid quar
antining of Chinatown as an admission
that the plague is in San Francisco. The
In my different tours through the dark.
reeking subterranean passages of China
town I could not help wishing that our
own Board of Health of Xew York could
hapdle the situation for just one week.
I confess a commendable pride as a citizen
of New York in our own Health Depart
ment, that Is only equal to that of the
Fire Department, to which I referred yes
terday. I am confident in the first place
that if such a board had full sway in this
city the conditions as at present existing
would be absolutely impossible, and if
they were found to exist there would be
such an army of inspectors, such a house
to-house visitation as would astonish the
most stolid and impassive Chinaman. I
do not say this as any reflection against
or upon the Board of Health of San Fran
cisco, but cannot help wishing that the
.New York board was here for just one
week: and then what would the citizens of
New York do under similar circumstances
as those prevailing in this city? Some of
the citizens said: "Well, It is impossible "
I have answered if you had our board
here they would show you whether It was
or not. It Is only a question of means.
The end Is sure: but the citizens of San
Francisco are thoroughly appreciating
this fact, and I think we can afford to wait
and see. San Francisco has never been
waked up before on sanitary questions
as she Is now. and there are earnest men
here that aro backing a movement for
reform which may astonish every one who
is awaiting results. So I think it is per
fectly warranted on the part of all con
cerned, here and elsewhere, to say that
the real situation Is not by any means so
bad as it might otherwise be.
It might interest the many readers of
the Herald and The Call to know that
condensed reports of theso special letter*
on the situation are being telegraphed
back across the continent to several of
the leading local papers. In one instance,
in apparent violation of the copyright, the
first letter almost in its entirety was re
produced here simultaneously with Us
publication in New York and In The Call,
having undoubtedly been- obtained from
an early copy of the Eastern paper. .This
will give the Herald's and Call's readers
an Idea of the appreciation by other news
papers of the enterprise of the Herald
and. The Call. Copious abstracts of the
reports are also reproduced In the Chin
ese publication that makes its appearance
daily In Chinatown. In proof of this I
was sent r copy of this Oriental sheet this
morning duly marked. I looked wise as
I held it In my hand, but the Celestial who
brought it to me politely but quickly Im
parted the information that I was read
ing it upside down, at which I decided to
defer until later an exploration of its
hieroglyphlcal contents.
THE GREAT LESSON OF THE HOUR
NO living case of plague yet seen in San Francisco. From
my point of view, being a mere visitor here, this con
dition of things is somewhat difficult to explain. In
this state of mind the people in San Francisco very
generally share. They say, if the plague is here, why is not
a real live example of it shown to us? San Francisco is
very much concerned about the quarantine question and well
she might be. The merchants are most particularly anxious
on the question, as it is easy to see that millions of dollars
are involved in its proper and practical settlement.
Texas has already quarantined against San Francisco.
The fear on the part of the people of San Francisco is that
other States, actuated by like and what appears to me to be
senseless fears, may also follow suit. The fact is every
precaution has been taken at this end of the line to guard
against any possible spread of the disease. It might almost
be said that plague is not here. Where is it? It is only the
fact that the authorities here are straining a point to be on
the right side, and I can testify to the fact that so far as
the control of the disease is concerned it is perfect here.
There is no cause for alarm on the part of outsiders. China
town is quarantined, and that quarantine is for* all practical
purposes perfect.
The universal verdict is that Chinatown must' be,
cleaned up, plague or no plague. I think I have in some de
scriptions of tours in this district made it so plain that
Chinatown is so notoriously filthy that almost any superla
tive could fit such a condition. Considering all things, it is a
great wonder that plague or any other infectious dis
ease has not swept Chinatown long ago with a tidal wave
of awful mortality. It is yet a serious question whether or
not we have heard of the last case from the recent invasion.
These are certainly serious considerations for San
Francisco and for all those who are directly or indirectly
connected with its vast mercantile and maritime interests.
She has" in her very midst the most threatening of ail con
tributing elements of plague propagation in the invitingly
filthy condition of her Chinese quarter. In this latter place,
if the plague should get a firm foothold, it will find its nat
ural soil for the most widespread and awful dissemination.
â¢The lesson of the hour seems to be that no possible chances
in any direction should be taken that it get" any foothold
whatever. I am confident from what I know of the dispo
sition on the part of the leading citizens here that it-.will be
all right in time if only a little patience is exercised and sis
ter States are willing to await the events of the next few
days. San Francisco has never been waked up before on
sanitary questions as she is now, and there are earnest
men here that are backing a movement for reform which
may astonish every one who is awaiting results. â Excerpt
from fourth day's report of Dr. George F. Shrady.
earnest in resorting to any and every
measure that may promise a solution of
this very serious problem. It does not
need reports from toner sections to en
force this deep-rootc-d and earnest convic
tion. There is really more anxiety in
this direction on the part of the citizens
to make this whole matter right than
would be believed unless seen and known.
I am so thoroughly convinced of this that
it seems necessary to ask those outside of
San Francisco to suspend judgment. I
am confident from what I know of the dis
position on the part of the leading citizens
here that it will all be right in time if
only a little patience is exercised and
sister States are willing to await the
events of the next few days. It seems
hardly necessary to elaborate the idea
concerning the absolutely filthy condition
of the district, but the good citizens of
New York have no idea of unsanitary con
ditions of the worst dwellings of New
York as compared with the better ones of
Chinatown.

2Ray (R.) of New York charged Sulzer
with' declaiming against trusts and bo
ing at the same time "a member of Tam
many-Hall, which is running. the New
York ice trust." â¢
arose out of a speech made by Sulzer (D.)
of New York against trusts. Sulzer
charged that the Republicans were try-
Ing to deceive the people with a pre
tense of legislation against trusts. "If t
had been running this side of the House."
said he, addressing the other side, "I
should have joined with you in 1 passing
this resolution. It would then have gone
to the Senate, where your trust Senators
would have buried it as they ; buried the
resolution we sent them for amendment
to elect Senators by direct vote of the
whole people."
"It 13 so bad," he added, "that no
Democrat goes to the polls because he
knows his .vote will not be counted."
This statement drew the fire of Driggs
(D.).of New York, who countered on
Mahon by charging that Philadelphia was
the "rottenest andT most - corrupt city In
the United. States."
"seems to be a prominent Democratic
official, of New York." .

WASHINGTON. May 21.â The House to
day under a special order adopted, after
an* exceedingly hot debate in which the
leaders on both Fides charged each other
with playing to the political galleries, en
tered upon the consideration of the reso
lution reported from the Judiciary Com
mittee proposing a constitutional amend
ment to lodge in Congress the power to
define, regulate, control, prohibit or dis
solve trusts, monopolies or combinations.
Cnder the terms of the order to-day,
with a night session to-night, was de
voted to debate and to-morrow at 5 o'clock
the vote is to be taken* with no oppor
tunity to amend. Saturday is to be de
voted to amending the Sherman anti-trust
; aw The Democrats charged that the
proposed constitutional amendment was
objectionable in even' way. that it was a
m^re political pretext; that it was unnec
essary and was proposed at the end of the
session for election purposes in the com
ing campaign. The Republicans repudi
ated the charge of bad faith.

perfect one. This is a proposition of the

"You have no real purpose to dissolve
or destroy trusts," said he, addressing the
Republican side. "You have been in ses
sion six months, but it is not until six
days before adjournment that you let this
question come up. No one dare s'and up
here and declare seriously on his honor
that he expects either the bill or resolu
tion to be acted upon in the Senate at this
session. This constitutional amendment
you know will never becomo part of the
constitution. It can never be ratified by
enough States. No State that believes In
thf> right of self-government will place in
Congress the power to come into a State
and control its domestic industries. The
trusts understand that they are not in the
remotest danger from this legislation. If
you would propose a simple amendment
giving Congress control of all organiza
tions engaged in interstate and foreign
commerce it would receive every vote on
this Bide of the chambrr.
"If you insist upon your amendment you
know it will never become part of the
constitution. There are two ways of en
couraging crime; one Is to close your eyes
to its existence and the other to offer an
impracticable obstacle. You are using the
latter method. You understand its pur
pose. I have sometimes doubted your
sincerity," said he In concluson. "I have
even doubted your political integrity.
Some of you may be hypocrites, some
even rascals, but none of you are fools."
Bailey's closing sentence was greeted
with prolonged Democratic applause, in
which some of the Republicans joined.
Dalzell closed the debate. No political
party and no individual, he said, had a fu
ture which was not against trusts. This
utterance was greeted with derisive Jeers
from the Democratic side. The difference
between the three political parties, he con
tinued, was that the Democratic and Pop
ullstic parties confined their opposition to
speechmaking. while the Republican party
believed in legislation. (Republican ap
plause and renewed Democratic jeers.)
Mr. Richardson attempted to offer a
"motion to recommit, but Dalzell made a
point of order against it and was sus
tained by the Speaker. The vote was
taken amid considerable excitement and
the rule was adopted. 141 to 118. It was
a strict party vote, with the exception of
Mr. Mann of Illinois, who voted with the
Democrats against the rule.
Proposition Ridiculous.
The minority amendments to the bill
were then offered and considered pend
ing, after which the debate upon the
resolution was formally opened by Ray.
chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
Ray's argument followed the lines of his
report. He said the proposition of the
minority to write into the constitution
something that was already there was
ridiculous. The power to regulate cor
porations engaged in interstate commerce
already existed. If the proposition of the
mlr.ori'ty was rot political claptrap, he !
did not know what was. The people had
felt the sting of the trust evil, he said,
and had appealed to State Legislatures {
and twenty-seven had responded. Twenty |
of them had passed effective anti-monop- '
oly legislation, but if the laws of the for- i
ty-flve States were uniform and if Con
gress passed a law In perfect harmony
with them, he argued it would still be im
possible for the States and the United
States together, without a constitutional 1
amendment, to relieve the people.: Â¦" Â¦
Ray was followed dv Merry of Arkan
sas on behalf of the minority. He ex
pressed regret that in so grave an issue
the Republican party had seen fit to pre
sent a constitutional amendment in so ob
jectionable a form that it could never
be Incorporated in the constitution. The
whole question, he said, had been treated
not from the broad standpoint of patriot
ism, but from the standpoint of party ex
pediency. If there was a sincere desire
to adopt a constitutional amendment.
why. he ask(Â»d. had the very firm section
been so worded as to make every Demo
crat who voted for it subscribe to the doe
trine that the constitution did not follow
the flag? AVhy submit such an entangling
proposition as this?
Landham of Texas occupied the re- 1
mainder of the day session in opposition
to the resolution.

lic omcers. : : . ,i:
Allen of Nebraska made a speech on
what he termed the indifference of the
Senate to the cause of the Boers.
At the instance of Stewart the Senate
agreed to an amendment providing for the
settlement of the Civil War claims of the
State of Nevada against the United
States, amounting to $400,000, and appro
priating money for this purpose.
Forest Reserve Land.
Pettigrew offered an amendment provld
j ing that all lands within the boundaries
i of any forest reservation that belongs to
! or is along the grant of a railroad com-
I pany and nad not heretofore been sold in
' good faith be examined under the direc
i tlon of the Secretary of the Interior with a
1 view to determining its character and
I value and that meantime none of the land
i shall be exchanged for other land outside
: of the reservation. The amendment was
j agreed to.
Pettigrew made a vigorous attack upon
j the work of the Industrial Commission,
declaring that it was merely a political
machine and its work absolutely useless.
Mr. Chandler, replying, denied that the
commission had been influenced by par
tisan consideration.
An amendment by McBride of Oregon,
i to enable the Secretary of the Interior to
i ascertain what persons made entry of
lands within the limits of any wagon road
I or railroad grant in Oregon, was agreed to.
Daniel of Virginia offered an amendment
appropriating $200,000 for beginning the
work on the proposed memorial bridge
across the Potomac River, extending from
the Naval Observatory to the Arlington
estate. It was adopted.
The bill was then reported to the Sen
ate and the amendments were agreed to,
with the exception of that relating to the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, to be held
in St. Louis in 1903.
Aldrich of Rhode Island proposed two
amendments to the exposition proposition,
the one providing that the appropriation
made by the Government should be dis-
I bursed under "condition's hereafter to be
I prescribed by Congress." and the other
I "that all sums expended by the Govern
j ment on account of said exposition, except
I for its own buildings and exhibits and the

cepted and agreed to by the Senate.
Morgan of Alabama moved to reduce

1 press from $3,000,000 to $3,000,000. Morgan
pupported the amendments in a vigorous
and caustic speech, to which Vest of

ment was rejected. ,

WASHINGTON. May Sl.-During a dis
cussion of the sundry civil bill in the
Senate to-day Jor.es of Arkansas made a
vigorous attack upon the administration
of the Paris Kxposition Commission by
Commissioner General Ferdinand W.
Peck. He pointed out that the law cre
ating the commission made it mandatory
upon the Commissioner General to make
a detailed report of his expenditures to
Congress. He read a message from the
President transmitting to Congress what
was termed "a detailed statement" of the
Exposition Commission's expenditure?.
The statement contained only eleven
Items, the aggregate expenditures being
5:i9.000.
Up to January I. 1900. Commissioner
General Peck had accounted for less than
$400,000 of the $1,400,000 appropriated for ex
position purposes. He demanded to know
where the balance of the appropriation
had gone. The so-called detailed state
ment contained items as 572.000 for clerk
hire. S3T2t for pcrsor.al traveling expenses
of Commissioner General, etc., which,
Jones said, were ridiculous as "details."
"It seems to me," said he warmly, "that
th'.s sort of thing should cease. These
etatements ought to be itemized, in ac
cordance with the mandate of the law."
Internal Dissension.
He then read a dispatch from Paris In
dicating that there was much dissension
among the members of the American
Commission to the exposition, some of
whom had been charged with an endeavor
to compel American exhibitors to pay for
the space allotted to them in the exposi
tion. He believed that an investigation of
the rr.atter ought to be made, in order
thut the people might have, the facts. He
then referred to a deficiency appropria
tion for the Paris Exposition that had
already been made, and inquired what
that was for. Hale in reply said that the
greater part cf it had been made for the
completion of buildings. The Committee
cn Appropriations believed that th^ sum
was necessary, although he was person
ally inclined to the opinion that the Paris
Kxposition was a bad performance.
"Who is this person Peck?" inquired
Stewart of Nevada.
"I don't know," replied Jones.
"If he Is a business man," suggested
Stewart, "there might be a suspicion of
his honesty; if not. his recklessness may
t>e attributed to ignorance."
*"\Vhat I complain of," continued Jones.
"is not that the committees of Congress
have not acted with due diligence, but
that no detailed statement of the expendi
ture of public money have been made.
The air has been full of rumors that there
have been the most extravagant and un
necessary expenditures of the fund pro
vided for the American exhibit and we all
know there never has been any satisfac
tory report as to how this money was
used."
Jcnes then said that in this connection
he desired to direct attention to the ex
penditure of the fund of $T)0,000.000 voted
by Congress to the President to be used
ai= a war emergency fund. He had. he
raid, the utmost confidence in the integ
rity of the President, but thought it was
due the public that a statement of the
disburserwpm of that fund should be
made. He referred to a story published

A MISSING SOLDIER
IS TRACED TO OMAHA
i JUDGE GEORGE H. BAHRS. |
JCDGE GEORGE H. BAHRS of the
Superior Court i^ ?latod for the of
fice of President of the National
Schuetzenbund, a position of honor
and trust in the eyes of the riflemen of
ihe T'nited States. Shortly after the local
delegates organized Robert Finking was
?lected to the position, which he accepted
with the proviso that _ he would only oc
cupy the chair, until "the Bund got into
:ood running oruer. *
ProFidor.t Finking stepped down and
out at the last meeting of the Bund two
weeks or so ago and the vice president.
Captain F. Auinjrer. took charge tem
porarily. The {iliing <â¢( vacancies falls
to the executive committee, which aftÂ«-r
carefully canvassing all the names sug
gested decided to recommend Judpe
Kahrs. who said he would accept if want
ed by the Bund. He will be reconi
menfled to the Bund at the next meeting,
which takes place on the 14th inst.. and
judging from the expressions of the local
rin>mon. lie will po in with RyinR colors.
Judge Bahrs is an rnthu.siastic marks
man and can be found at nearly every
shoot of the clubs to which he belongs.
He Is never absent from a public prize
event. He stands very high in the esteem
of his fellow riflemen, and his election
ip practically assured.
At the next meeting of the Bund the
matter of target ranso is almost, certain
to be decided. The rivalry between the
partisans of Shell Mound "and Schuctzen
Park has beÂ«>n too warm for comfort.
It is now believed by many that Shell
Mound will be selected. The managers
of both ranges have made liberal offers,
and wherever the big rifle tournament is
held in June and July, 1001, the marksmen
will have the best of accommodations.
A? soon as the range is selected the dele
gates to the Bund will get down to work
and prepare to make the tournament a
success that will surprise the visiting ri
flemen from the East.
Thomas Costello's Interference Leads
to His Arrest and Conviction

He grabbed hold of the controller bar,
and, despite the statement just made by
him. turned on the full current and the
car s=ped down the hill at lightning speed.
It took three men to torf.e Costello to
release his hold of the controller bar.
Then he fell otf the car and used language
that was shocking. He was arrested for
disturbing the peace and was fined ?o
yesterday by Judge Fritz.

BAHRS MAY BE
BUND PRESIDENT
Recommended to Succeed
Finking by Executive
Committee.
It is obvious that no student shc>uld be paid
for his athletics. The practice ftf assisting
young mrn through college in order, that they
may strengthen the athletic teams is degrad
ing to amateur sports, and the false loyalty
which induces graduates to pay the expenses of
such men cannot fail to affect the moral sense
of the recipients. The large sums of money
taken in at many of the football games form
a constant temptation to extravagance and to
the illicit use of money. , It is. therefore, de
sirable that Kate money should be reduced to
a minimum by agreement of all universities.
The mission of the seneral public to buy tickets
which any one can buy has a tendency to make
of the games great public spectacles foreign
to the eplrtt of university life, and the sooner
this objectionable feature Is dealt with the
better for athletics. It. would seem well to
limit the attendance upon the great (tames
to the students and their friends. Something
has already been done toward this end by llm-.
King the games to college grounds.
Another objectionable practice Is the inter
ference with boys who have developed a taste
for athletics" In the preparatory schools. â¢ In
many cases correspondence Is opened by gradu
ate committees ln search of athletic material,
or. emissaries are sent out and all sorts of in
fluence thrown ' around school boys to induce
them to enter certain Institutions. Sometimes
even financial aid is promised toward an edu
cation. Some of our universities are reported
to have a regular system of looking up likely
athletes among the schools. The gladiatorial
and professional tendencies thereby promoted
are totally destructive of sane athletics. Any
practice which makes athletics an end, and
not a means of promoting health through an
enjoyable competition in outdoor sports, is ob
jectionable as professionalism. For this rea
son the inordinate preparation required by
K.me of our games should be discouraged.
There Is no reason why college teams, or even
parts of college teams, should be. assembled
for practice during the summer; and when
they receive a money benefit by having even
their extra expenses paid, the practice trenches
danfterously near professionalism. It would be
better if all universities and colleges could be
brought to give up even the preparatory prac
tice for two weeks before the term opens.
The report closes with the admonition
thatâ
The report recommends that colleges
should pay particular attention to the
scholarship of their teams. Every mem
ber, it says, should be in good standing:,
and one student should have as many
hours of study as another. No student
who is deficient in his work at the
beginning: of a term should be permitted
to play that year until he has made up the
rtpficiency. Four years is the greatest
length of time- a man should he permitted
to participate !n contests.
The report advises against the policy of
offering inducements to members of pre
paratory schools to enter college for the
sole purpose of athletics. Preliminary or
summer practice, or playing on so- called
"summer teams," it says, should also be
legislated against. Regarding this the re
port says:
The member of an athletic team who is get
ting through college on the barest possible
margin is throwing discredit upon good ath
letics.

TALL COMEDIAN
IS BACK AGAIN
BERKELEY, May 31.â The most im
portant document upon collegiate
athletics that has ever been pre
pared Is the report of the special
committee from the universities of Har
vard. Pennsylvania, Princeton, Brown,
California, Columbia and Cornell, which
was made public to-day in Berkeley, New
York and other Eastern points. The re
port is the outcome of a meeting held at
Brown University in 1S9S, and after two
years' work it was prepared. This report
goes /over the entire field of collegiate
sports and makes a series of the most
radical recommendations and proposes a
new set of rules.
The report is decided against allowing
athletics to interfere with- studies. It
seeks to confine athletic exhibitions as
much as possible to students, and to ex
clude the public, and it vigorously opposes
the practice of paying the way of ath
letes through college to secure their ser
vices in the field. An effort is made for the
purification of intercpllegiate athletics, the
maintenance of the highest amateurstand
ards and the promotion of intercollegiate
comity.
It recommends that there shall be no in
tercollegiate contests on any except uni
versity athletic fields; that "no student
shall be a member of both the freshman
and university teams: that no student
shall represent his university in more
than one branch of sport ln a single
academic year without permission from
the athletic committee: that no student
shall represent the university If he has
been dropped from his class into a lower
class or from the first year class out of
the university: that no student shall re
ceive his board free at the training table:
that there shall be no summer team prac
tice excepting for ten days before the
openingof the fall term, and that no tick
ets shall be sold to the. general public for
intercollegiate contests until the students
themselves have had the. first chance to
buy."
It protests against the practice of finan
cially assisting athletes and against scour
ing the country for crack athletes. The
report says:
At present athletic sports occupy a dispro
portionate amount of attention in many of
our universities, colleges and. schools, and the
main end of all rules must be to prevent out
door sports and physical exercises from inter
fering with the mental and moral training of
the students. If this cannot be done, the sports
bid fair to become a positive evil. No student
should be permitted to make athletics the prin
cipal occupation of his college life. We are
not engaged ln making athletes, but rather
good citizens whose mental powers have been
pustalned and increased by adequate physical
vigor Imparted in the gymnasium and the field,
without creating undue pride of athletic prow
ess and an exaggerated notion of its value.
Only genuine members of the university
should be permitted ln public exhibitions, and
gateway considerations should be eliminated.

CHICAGO, May SI.â All day yesterday
and to-day a large blue and gold flag has
waved over the Hotel Lexington, and pco-
pie wonder what it signifies. Many Cali
forriians noticed it and came In to call on
us. It makes us feel good to see that there
is some one in this large city who is in
sympathy with up.
The team, on the whole, is not In good
condition. Some of the men are feeling
fine, while others are disabled. Woolsey
contracted a bad cold while on the train
Monday night and he has been unable to
Train durinc" th.Â» work. If his cold Js bet
:er by Saturday he will be all right, not
withstanding bis lack of training. Hoff
man's leg is Improving very slowly, and
he too hag not trained for the past two
v.-eeks. He w;ll not be able to enter the
pole vault, liut ho will take a few trials
ln the lilgh jump. Hoffman's accident will
lose the day for us. as he could in all prob
ability have won both his events. Brough
ton will be able to take a few trials in
The broad jump. Drum has quite recov
ered from the effects of the faJl he re
ceived last Monday in the finish of the
quarter-mile. Walsh's accident of two

ning a place is the walk Yesterday was
hi* i:rpt day on ihe track. The rest of the
team are in iirst-c'.ass condition. If the
whole Team war in trim we would have
no trouble in winning the championship.
Plaw tried ihrow'.ne the discus to-day,
but he was unable to <^atch the knack of

The team of the l"nlvf>rsity of Minnesota
arrived at the Lexington Hotel to-day.
They are a brawny, raw-boned lot of
young men and look as if they were
trained to the utmost.
ThÂ« representative of the T'nivcrsity of

SACRAMENTO, May 31.-In the fourth
round of what was to have been a twenty
round bout Phil Green knocked out Frank
Purcell. The fight was pulled off at the
headquarters of the Sacramento Athletic
Club and was witnessed by about 1200
spectators. â¢
The battle was fast and furious and up
to the instant the deciding blow was
struck both men were fresh and fought
like furies. Green was aggressive from
the start, but Purcell got away from his
swings ln the first three rounds and land
ed several body blows which shook the
"soldier." The latter, however, was light
ing all the time and kept Purcell guessing.
The end came like a bolt from a clean
sky. There had been several hot mix
ups in the round. In which neither man
appeared to have an advantage. Then
Green feinted for the body with his left
and Purcell's guard came down to block
the jolt. Quicker than a flash the blow,
which was already under way, was given
an upward turn, landing flush on Purcell's
jaw. He went down like a log and did
not regain consciousness for five minutes.
The tight was refereed by William John
sr.n, boxing in.=tr:i' tor of the club.
â¢ In the preliminary bout Harry Slater
knocked out Harry Glover in the first
round.
In the second event Jack Stelzner
knocked out Tom Costello of Fresno in
the fourth round. Costr-llo depended upon
his punching powers to win. and gave
Jack several hard punches before the end'
came.

CHICAGO, May 31.â The six-round bout
between Kid McCoy and Tommy Ryan at
Tattersall's last Tuesday night, which
Referee Malachi Hogan awarded to Mc-
Coy the end of the sixth round, has
now been officially declared a draw. Im
mediately after the fight Ryan protested
against the decision, claiming that the
contestants had agreed upon a. drew if
both were on their feet at the wind-up,
emphasizing his protest with a fistic
assault on Hogan. They were separated
by the police and Hogan disclaimed any
knowledge of the agreement between the
boxers. The Tattersall Athletic Club
to-night officially rescinded the decision
ln the following statement:
"To the Public: Owing to the public con
troversy ensuing on thÂ« decision rendered
last Tuesday night and ln justice to

Club has rescinded the decision of Referee
Malachi Hogan in the contest between

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 1900.
LARENCE J. BERRY'S mastiff Julian, the most widely known dog in the
(( faraway gold fields of Alaska, is dead. Exposure, to the rigors ., of the
\^ northern climate put an end to. the career of a dog which had traveled
hundreds of miles over the pathless ice and had hauled thousands of
pounds of freight. Mr. . Berry first put him to work on a sled in 1835, when the
dog hauled provisions for the season over the Chilkoot Pass. In the following
year the dog was the mainstay of the team which was used by Mrs. : Berry
when she went to Join her husband. On this perilous trip all the dogs except ;
Julian gave out and he had to haul the load, which weighed over 1000 pounds, ~
by- himself across the frozen surface of Lake Bennett. When the party reached
Dawson the dog hauled most of the lumber and used . by : Mr. ; Berry ln Â¦
his mines and houses. So famous did Julian become that his owner was" offered
fabulous sums for him, but declined, to consider any proposition which meant
parting with his faithful servant. .^ .
â¢ In 1898 the dog suffered from rheumatism brought on by exposure. This.ren
dered him useless as a draft. animal. Mr. Berry sent him*to Fresno for treat
ment and as he did not improve there he was sent, to Santa Cruz, where he
remained several months. Disease had so strong a hold on him that he could
not shake it off. He finally succumbed to a complication of canine ailments. .

FRESNO, May 31.-M. Theo. Kearney,
president of the California Raisin Grow
ers' Association, to-day filed in the Su
perior Court a suit for $20,000 against the
Fresno Evening Democrat, which has
been criticizing his conduct as president
of the combine. The complaint consists
of two counts, one based on an editorial
and the other on a local item which ap
peared on the 20th.
Kearney was accused in both Items of
using his position to further his private
interests. It was also stated that he had
entered into a secret compact with cer
tain packers In regard to seeding' patents
regardless of tho interests of the associa
tion, which were thereby sacrificed. The
items appeared shortly after a mass meet
ing of growers at which Mr. Kearney was
denied a raise In salary from $500 to $1000
a month. The meeting accepted his
resignation.

VETERANS' ELECTION.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 31.â By a vote
of 101 to 68 the Sons of Confederate Vet
erans this afternoon refused to lay on the
table a motion offered by \V. H. McLaws,
division commander of Georgia, that only
tho Confederate flag be carried in the
Sons of Veterans' division of the Confed
erate reunion parade to-morrow.
Mr. McLaws said he understood the
United States flag was to be carried at
the head of the Sons of Veterans.
â¢ A number of delegates made speeches
and it became apparent that an expected
issue had come before the convention.
Several delegates strongly urged that the
Sons of Veterans carry both the United
States and the Confederate flags in the
parade. The part played by the South in
the Spanish-American war and President
McKinlcy's recent action in wearing a
Confederate button and suggesting that
the Lnited States Government treat the
Confederate Just as it treats the Union
soldiers were urged as reasons why the
Lnited States flag should be carried by
the Sons of Veterans. After a number of
speeches had been heard there were re
joinders. The discussion was growing
wider and more interesting-, when it was
cut off by the motion to table Mr. Mc-
Laws' motion.
All the speakers said no veteran's son
was to-day disloyal to the United States
flag, but they regarded the Confederate
flag as the emblem of their organization
and thought it should not leave their pa
rade for that reason. As the discussion
had prolonged considerably the ses
sion of the convention, adjournment was
taken after the tabling of the McLaws
motion until to-morrow, when the ques
tion is expected to come up for final ac
tion.

Some lawyers who have studied the law
relating to the power of the Sheriff to

force of deputies which he is organizing
believe the Sheriff is not organizing a

summoned failed to obey the summons of
the Sheriff.
The Police Board decided to-day to arm
the posse with riot guns. The weapon is
a short-barreled repeating shotgun

SEATTLE. "Wash.. May 31.â According
to advices received from Skagnay on the
Rosalie, which arrived this morning, the
body of an unknown man has been found
a short distance from the main trail near
White Pass City. The body was resting
against a bowlder In an upright position,
Â«s If the man In life had been resting after
a hard climb up the mountain. The man
had evidently been dead for six weeks.
There were no papers on the body by
which his name or residence could be as
certained, and after an Investigation by
the Coroner's Jury the body was burled
where It was found. Evidently the dead
man must have been caught in one of the
many blizzards that occurred on the
White Pass durine last winter and froze
to death- Numbers of rumors were cur
rert at different times of parties becoming
lost and dyins on the trail. _

OLEOMARGARINE AND BUTTER.
SECRETARY GAGE, in response to a request
from t^ie House- of Representatives, recently
submitted to that body a report of the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue concerning the nature
and comparative quantities of ingredients that enter
into the composition of oleomargarine. The state
ment gives the. materials used for that purpose dur
ing the year ending June 30, 1890, as follows:
Materials. Pounds. Per cent.
Neutral lard Sl.297,251 34.27
Oleo oil : 24.401.769 : 26.82
Cottonseed oil..... 4,357,514 . 4.77

Cream ; 3,527,410 - 3.S6
â¢ Totals .......> 31.322,260 100.00
The dairymen are- said to be not entirely satisfied
with the report because it does not show the quan
tities and kinds' of chemicals used in coloring and
flavoring the product so as to make it resemble but
ter. It has been explained, -however, that if chemi
cals are used, as the dairymen assert, they are em
ployed in the preparation of the ingredients, and are
therefore really included in the table given.
Secretary Knight of the' Dairymen's Union is re
ported by the Philadelphia Record to have calculated
the cost of the material given in the report and con
cluded that oleomargarine can be produced at' the
factory at a little less than eight cents a pound. If
that be, correct there is a bigÂ»profit in selling it under
thename of butter at butter, prices.
While the list of ingredients shows that no in
jurious substances are used" in the composition of
oleomargarine, it is evident an injustice is done when
il is marketed as butter. No article should be per
mitted to be sold under a. false label. There are'many
worse frauds in the way of foodstuffs than, oleomar
garine, but even that pica is no defense for the wrong
done to the dairymen when It is passed off upon the
public as genuine butter.
Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia Â°has
joined the First Regiment of Feotguards as a private
in the ranks, but woe be to the officer: above him
who treats him as aÂ°soldier instead of a Prince.
SOME OBLIGING POLITICIANS
WASHINGTON people, according to a New
York visitor to the capital, are notable for their
courtesy and for their ignorance. Everybody
in the city, he says, is polite and obliging, but in?
asmuch as they know nothing accurately and are too
lazy to learn it, the politeness is- not only inefficient,
but is more harmful than helpful. Any one in Wash 1
tngton, he says, will stop and courteously answer
your questions and give you directions to any place
you wish to go. but they never direct you rightly.
As an illustration of these characteristics of the peo
ple he tells this story: "The evening of the day I
landed in Washington I was standing by the Arling
ton Hotel when a gentleman, evidently a stranger,
came dashing up in a tremendous hurry. He hailed
one of the cabmen and asked where the Public Li
brary was. Did the cabman hesitate? Not for a mo
ment. Touching his hat with the suavity of a Ches
terfield, he pointed up the street and told the man that
it was on Seventeenth street. And he, poor devil!
went running up the street so fast that he didn't hear
me as I yelled after him that it was away down be
low Fourteenth street, in exactly the opposite direc
tion. I went up to the cabman and said: 'Why did
you say that? You don't know where the Public Li
brary is, do you?' He was unmoved. 'Well, sah.' he
returned, in the gentle Washington voice, 'I can't say
as I do know, exactly, but the gentleman seemed so
anxiousl didn't want to disappoint him.' "
The discovery of these traits ! almost universally
among the residents cf the national capital is interest
ing. . It furnishes one of the best illustrations on
record of the influence of statesmen upon those
among whom they live. For years the American
politician has been noted for his willingness to give
advice, counsel and direction upon any. subject un
der the sun withaw^ knowing anything about it;
When the public shows itself anxious for information
the statesman will not disappoint him. Thus at this
moment we are being politely informed how to deal
with the Philippines, how to regulate trusts, how to
interfere in the South African war, and how to con
trol railroads, by courteous orators ; who know no
more about any of those things than the Washing r
ton cab-driver knew about the location of the Public
Library. o o
What polite but- inefficient cab-driver in Washing
ton or elsewhere was ever more: ready to give direc
tions than Bryan, for example? In â what .direction
does any class of American people wish to go, but
what some, obliging politician is ready to point out
the way. merely to avoid disappointing Jhe anxious?
About the only interest people take in Towne's
position as candidate tor Vice President on the Bryan
ticket is to see whether he will take the toboggan
slide gracefully qr get oft* like a man who has stepped
on a banana-peel. '
Chinese Returns From the Dead.
Bernard Stahl. the well-known New
York -cigar manufacturer, while in this
city recently outfitting the ill-fated La
tuya Bay mining expedition, in which he
was heavily interested, told of a remarkable
accident he witnessed while crossing the
Pacific in the old side-wheel steamship
Niantic in 1874. He was just fresh from
school at the time and had accepted the
invitation of a young Japanese of good
family who had been his classmate to re
turn with him to Japan for a visit of sev
eral months. Incidentally it might be
stated that three days after their arrival
in Japan the Jap borrowed Stahl's pistol
and blew his own brcins out because his
sweetheart had forgotten him during his
absence and had married another fellow.
But that Is another story.
It was on tfte outward voyage that the
incident happened that Mr. Stahl related
to a group of friends at the Palace one
evening. It appears that the Niantic ran
into a big storm that amounted almost to
a hurricane. During the worst part of
the blow a Chinese sailor, who was at
work on the fore mainsail yard, was
wrenched from his perch and thrown
headlong into the sea. Just ahead of the
port paddle box. The pea was too rough
to put down a boat. As nothing was seen
of the Chinese after he struck the water,
he was given up as lost, and a note to that
effect was entered in the log. It was sev
eral .hours before the storm subsided and
the ship put' on J her course. Then the
chief engineer ordered the paddle boxes
opened to see if any damage was done.
Imagine the astonishment of the oilers
whon they found the unfortunate sailor's
body in the port paddle box, lying limp
across a timber just out of reach of the
wheel. The body was dragged out and
turned; over to the. surgeon, who soon
found that the man was only stunned and
had sustained no serious injury. When
on the following day the sailor was put
back to work among his fel'ows they re
fused to associate with him. claiming that
he was a spirit returned from the dead.
Mr. Stahl vouches for the truth of this
strange story and refers to Captain How
ard, now superintendent of the Oceanic
Steamship Company, but then master of
tne Niantic,- for verification. Captain
Howard says that he has a vague recol
lection of such an Incident, but cannot
say certainly, as in those days there were
so many strange things and be had so
much .else to think about that he did not
tax his. mind to remember stories of
Chinamen.

MVT GOODWIN', now playing at the
Columbia Theater in "When We
Were Twenty-one," was in story
telling mood the night of his ar
rival, and for two <jr three hours after the
show he helped drive dull care out of the
heads of a half dozen men gathered about
the round table in a corner of the Palace
bar. One of the many webs of mirth
which he spun goes as follows:
"You know that occasionally I gamble â
Just by way of recreationâ stocks, horses,
prizefights, and even a bit on the green
cloth. 'A few days before I left New York
on my present tour I called upon a friend,
a stock broker, to watch the ticker and
the tape, for I have been interested at
various times of my life in ice and to
baccoâin the days before the trusts.
Alongside of me sat a tall, uncouth fel
low, with the burrs buried so deeply in
his hair that they clung to his scalp. 'A
piker.' said I to myself, and every time
that machine ticked he would growl au
dibly but indistinctly. The ticks on my
machine were none too rhythmic and joy
provoking, and I lost patience, so, squar
ing my shoulders and sticking out my
front, I walked up to him and said:
" 'Say, can't you keep quiet? Be glad.
You're only a piker. If you can't stand
the strain, why, quit it. How much have
you lostâ $5?'
" 'We 1 .!, I guess you're right.' came the
slow, painful, drawling response. 'I
think I -will quit for to-day. I'm a farmer,
and I guess I'd better go back to my
ranch. It's a good one, too, and I can
make more money that way than hanging
over this darned thing. I've lost 5350,000
to-day, and it sort of pinches.'
"Well," continued the comedian, "I
turned on my heels and went away. Guess
I was the piker."

THE MONUMENT AT /1NT1ETAM.
WHEN the historian of the future appraises the
statesmanship of the leaders of this generation
it is probable he will give the highest place
to those who by their work and by their words so
directed legislation and molded public opinion that all
feelings of animosity between the contending forces
of the Civil War passed away within the lifetime of
the men that fought it. When it is recalled how prone
the human heart is to cherish bitter memories, how
easily passions are aroused and how difficult it is -for
the kindly voices of peace and good will to get a hear
ing amid the strifes and antagonisms of the world, it
will be conceded that those who preached peace in the
North and in the South merit the gratitude of the
people, and praise at least as high as that given to
any other measure of statecraft in our time.
It is a matter of gratification that among the leaders
who were influential in bringing about the era of
good feeling were men of both sections and of all
parties. General Grant set the hearts of Northern
men to beating in the right way to the right senti
ment in his famous declaration, "Let us have peace."
Charles Sumner, Avith less tact and sagacity, but with
an equal earnestness, sought to achieve the same end
when he proposed to have the name of battles in the
Civil War erased from the national standards. " That
movement on the part of the Senator from Massachu
setts is a curious illustration of how little human na
ture is regulated by logic. Sumner believed, and
logically he was right, that there could be no genuine
reconciliation between the North 1 and the South un
til the battles between them were forgotten, but the
event has proved that battle memories have been more
potent in restoring unity of sentiment to the men of
the rival hosts than anything- else. In no single in
stance have there been unde'r other conditions any
such demonstrations of friendliness among the vet
erans o( the blue and the gray as have occurred at
gatherings upon famous battlefields.
The process of reconciliation has gone on by de
grees, slow at first, but now following one another
rapidly. It is only a few years ago that a proposal to
return the battle flags of the Southern States was re
ceived in the North with an outburst of indignation,
but recently "the same proposal ha> been put forth
again, and received this time if not with approval at
least with something very different from anger. The
change in public sentiment on that point is significant
of the recent growth of liberality on both sides, and
serves as a measure fcr estimating the swiftness with
which the old-time animosity is dying out.
; Perhaps the most notable illustration of the pres
ent Â° sentiment qjl the people on the subject is that
which was afforded by the dedication on Memorial
day of a monument at Antietam erected to the mem
cry of those who died for the South as well as for
those who died for Ihe North. The significance of
such a monument was made the more impressive by.
the presence during the ceremonies of the President
cf the United States, himself a soldier in the Union
army during the battle. The country has read with
full approval his short speech, and the people share
with him the gladness which he expressed in the
words: "I am glad to preside over a nation of 80,000,
oco people more united than they have ever been. TI12
achievements of that war are the heritage of there
who failed and those who prevailed. When we went
to war two years ago the men of the South vied with
the men of the North in bravery. Together the men
of the North and the South are standing to-day fcr
the flag that we love and which proudly waves over
us all."
A Democratic candidate for the office of Railroad
and Warehouse Commissioner in Missouri is said to
be making his campaign by singing coon songs in
stead of making speeches, and perhaps that is as good
a way of dodging the calamity platform in a year of
prosperity as any that could be devised.

CHINATOWN AND THE CHANCES.
DR. SHRADY in defining the situation in re
spect to bubonic plague in Chinatown, and
pointing out the lesson to be learned from it,
sr.id in his signed statement published in The Call
yesterday: 'The few cases which have already
occurred, as adding to the ordinary mortality statis
tics, are of comparatively trivial moment in them
selves. We are simply called to count chances for the
future."
The two propositions in that statement should be
noted with equal care by the people. In the first
place let it be impressed upon all that the sporadic
cases of the piague which have been discovered do not
in any Way justifj* a panic or even alarm; still less
do they afford any grounds for establishing a quaran
tine against San Francisco, or for doing any injury to
trade and business. The only effect which these
cases should have upon the public mind is that of
arousing a determination on the part of the people
and the municipal authorities ; to clean out Chinatown
and compel the Chinese to obey the sanitary regula
tions of the city.
We are called upon to count chances for the future.
In making that count no one who has even such a
knowledge of Chinatown as can be obtained by look
ing at it from the streets that pass through it can fail
to perceive that the count will show more chances
against the health of the city than for it so long as
the present conditions prevail. Where a few cases
of bubonic plague have occurred the chances are that
more may occur: where that pestilence breaks out
the chances are other pestilences may have their
source. Where there are filth and vice, ignorance and
superstition, rotten food, vile habits and customs of
utter abomination there are more chances of- disease
than of health. In counting for the future that much
of the odds against us can be neither denied nor
evaded.
The outer aspect of Chinatown, however, gives but
a slight knowledge cf the foulness within the build
ings and beneath the ground. As under the base
ments of the houses there are cellars, and below the
cellars still deeper depths of dismal burrows, so be
neath the outward dirt and grime of the place and the
manifest showing of vice and degradation there are
deeps of foulness which are unspeakable in the Eng
lish language. In the fetid tunnels and passages there
are habitations so pestilential that an opening into
the foulest sewers of the city is regarded as a venti
lation. Nothing but the smell of burning punk sticks
enables even Chinese to tolerate the atmosphere, and
only the smoke that pervades it prevents the air from
exhaling death to all who breathe it.
Over that district, occupying the very heart of the
city, sloping down from the residences of millionaires
on California Hill to the great avenues of trade on
Kearny and Montgomery streets, Chinatown forms a
slum from whose emanations there is hardly any es
cape. Over it the fire and the sanitary regulations of
the city are unknown. Elsewhere the ordinances pro
viding for proper sewerage, plumbing, pure air. clean
liness and protection against fire are enforced. In
ChinatowrVthey are not enforced now nor have they
ever been enforced. So far as sanitary laws are con
cerned-this central spot in San Francisco might as
well be in China itself.
The issue before us is that of cleaning out China
town and keeping it clean. If that can be achieved in
a thorough manner without resorting to radical
measures, let it be so: but whatever is done should be
thorough. The health authorities should overhaul
even' building in the district, close up all the under
ground passages, and then give notice to' the owner
that until the building has been disinfected and re
arranged in accord with the sanitary laws of the city
no tenant will be permitted to occupy it. In no part
of San Francisco is it more imperative that the health
and fire ordinances should be enforced than in this
district, where they have been wholly ignored. In
that respect there must be a radical change in the
loliey of the administration of the city. The appear :
ancc of a few cases of bubonic plague is. as Dr.
Shrady says, "of little moment" in itself, but we are
now counting chances for the future and we cannot
afford to take ?:ny such hazard as that which is con
tained in Chinatown under its present conditions.
It is pleasant to learn'that the Germans do not like
lie plan of retaliation proposed in Congress as a
neans of petting even with the German meat bill. It
vas just for the purpose of displeasing them that the

Graduating exercises of the California
School cf Mechanical Arts were held yes
terday in the large drawing room of the
institution at the corner of Utah and Six
teenth streets.
Horace Davis, president of the board of
directors, presided, and after a benedic
tion by Rev. Dr. Woodward of Trinity
Methodist Church, he made a brief ad
dress to the audience. President Davia
then announced some changes in the
board of trustees. John O. Earl, one of
the original trustees of the school and a
personal appointment of James Lick, its
loander. died in January last, and A. S.
Hallidie. aiso named by the founder,
passed away recently. Dr. Horatio Steb
bins has resigned to go East to remain
some years and Frank. J. Symmcs,
Charles A. Murdock and E. B. Pond have
been chosen to till the vacancies. These
gentlemen, with James Spiers and Mr.
Davis, will form the board of trustees.
The following programme was then
given: Violin solo, intermezzo from "Ca
valleria Rusticana." Sidney F. Samish;
address, Frank J. Symmes; vocal solo, se
lected. Miss Marcia Baylor; piano solo,
"Le Reve." Miss Ella Michael.
Trustee Spiers made a few remarks ana
complimented the school on its efficiency,
lie gave the graduates some good advice
and closed by wishing them the success
in the world that they had estat ashed as
students of the school.
Principal Merrill, after the exercises,
presented the diplomas to the successful
pupils. He spoke of the enrollment of the
school, saying that the next class of be
ginners will be organized Monday, July 30.
and that the number of boys admitted
will be limited to seventy-Jive. Applica
tions have been received and accepted up
to that number and many more are on
file. It is not probable that all will qual
ify and there will probably be twenty
places for which a competitive examina
tion will be held July 27. The school haa
an enrollment of 31V. which Is more by
tifty than can be accommodated.

Reply to
FATHER YORKE.
>
Referring to Father Torke's ar
ticle on "The Smaller Colleges,
published in The Call of Thursday.
Dr. Jordan said:
I find the article very in
teresting indeed and in many
respects I fully agree -with
the gifted writer. I have never
consciously gone out of my
way to depreciate smaller col
leges, whether Catholic or
Protestant, and I have not
the slightest interest in big
ness for bigness' sake.
I am sure that Father
Yorke does not mean that
either in the excellent college
of St. Mary's, or yet in Stan
ford professors are selected
by the kind of "pull" which
was once in vogue in the
schools of San Francisco. If
he will look into this matter
he will find a difference, and
one in which St. Mary's and
Stanford stand side by side.
I may also remind Father
Yorke that I have never said,
anything about the education
at Stanford being better than
any other form of education.
It is as good as the Stanford
teachers know how to make it,
and with that conviction our
boasting ends. We have our
own theories of education and
its relation' to "success in
life." These are not exclu
sive, and I am glad that Cali
fornia is broad enough to de
velop forms of education along
other theories.
The State needs the help of
all, and as good, citizens we
rejoice in the progress of St.
Mary's and Santa Clara and
their sister colleges as we re
joice in our own.
TELE SAX FllAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 1000.
6
ASIA has ever teen a land of the mysterious.
Its people are like the ocean, incessantly
mutable, yet unchanged from age to age. It
is a land where almost anything may happen except
improvement. We are having at this moment a
striking illustration of its incomprehensible ways.
While America and Europe are bu?y making plans for
the partition or the preservation of China, and are
talking gravely of the future of Chinese trade and
Chinese development, behold there comes up from the
depths of its population a force which, rolling forward
like a tidal wave in the sea, threatens to sweep away
the existing order of things and leave behind it an
entirely new problem for diplomats to deal with.
Only a short time ago the "Boxers" were described
as a small but turbulent band of fanatics roused to
action by their hatred of what they call "foreign
devils." A little later it was announced that the band
had become dangerous and might cause disturbance in
ore or two seaports. Now it has grown to be an im
mense movement. It is no longer an insurrection. It
is a rebellion. It menaces not only seaports, but the
capital: not only foreigners, but the Government.
It i* supposed to have the sympathy of the Chinese
army. Nor is that all â the final Asiatic characteristic
is given to the situation by the report that the Em
press is on the side of the rebels and is aiding them in
the crusade
A rebellion sustained by the army and counte
nanced by the sovereign would be something extra
ordinary in Europe, but it is not notably strange in
Asia. In fact, the career of the Boxers thus far has
::ot been so remarkable as the career of the Empress
herself. That little eld woman called the Dowager
Tsi An is in many respects the mo<t wonderful crea
ture now living, and she is quite capable of organizing
a revolt against her Government for the purpose of
getting control of a power which will enable her to
alter the Government and remake it nearer to her de-
It is upward of forty years since the Empress fir^t
became noted for her talent for court intrigue and
made herself feared in Chinese politics. It is said she
was originally a slave girl and that her early suc
cesses were due to her skill in dancing and singing.
Cnce in an assured position, however, she proved
herself able to make others dance and sing to what
tune she pleased. Her diplomacy has shifted and
changed with the exigencies of the time, but on the
whole she is regard-d as the strongest foe of reform
in China, thoroughly devoted to the ancient civiliza
tion and a bitter opponent of a^'thing in the way of
foreign influence. When she has been compelled by
necessity to favor one or the other of the rival powers
seeking advantage in China it is said she has inva
riably inclined to Russia, but in the main she has
fought for her own hand, and Russia would have
nothing to hope for if she had her way.
It is against a Government headed by such a
woman, but largely controlled by persons adverse to
her pretensions, the Boxers are directing their re
volt. There is therefore nothing incredible in the re
port that the Empress gives them countenance. Asia
is simply working out one more mystery, and the
nations which have supposed they could deal with
China at their leisure may find action precipitated
upon them before the roses of the coming June fade
in the gardens.
It certainly was unkind of the footpad, who returned
his victim's watch, to say that the police ply the same
interesting trade in which he modestly admits success.
Any one of thousands of pedestrians can testify that
the police are not in evidence on the streets after the
lights go out. ~
It may never be necessary to burn any considerable
part of Chinatown to clean the plague spot, but it is
comfortable to remember that if nothing else prov
effective that will.
The street-car strike has Riven the people of St.
Louis one advantageâ they will not Have to go out of
town to get pedestrian exercise by way of a holiday.
It looks as if Oom Paul had decided to adopt
Aguinaldo tactics and live to fight another day.
In every part of the United States such advisers are
common, but fortunately they do not congregate
anywhere except at the national capital. The Wash
ington people, therefore, are to be pitied rather than
condemned for their polite inefficiency. It is their
misfortune, not their fault, and it should be remem
bered they acquired the habit from statesmen elects)

Ernest Hartmann, a Sailor, Commits
Suicide by Swallowing a Dose .
of Deadly Poison.
It Is rarely or ever that a sailor dies
for love. "Jack" generally has a sweet
heart in every port, and the one at the
place where his ship happens to be at
anchor Is the one he loves best. Ernest
Hartmann was an exception to this rule,
however. He was formerly a sailor; on
the revenue cutter Bear, but gave up. his
job In order to work at the Mall dock and
be near pretty Helen Johnson. Miss John
eon lives with Mrs. James Donahue at 524
First street and Hartmann also made his
home there. Mrs. Donahue is his sister.
A few days ago Hartmann asked Miss
Johnson to be his wife and .she refused.
Yesterday he heard she was to be married
In a few weeks to a friend, of his and
that broke his heart. He told a' friend
that life was not worth living without
Helen, and that he intended to end It all.
Yesterday morning he was found in an
unconscious condition in the rear of the
coal yard kej>t by James Donahue oh
First street, near Brannan. Beside him
was an empty two-ounce vial labeled
"Laudanum." Corporal Cockrlll was noti
fied and hurrying from the Mall dock to
the scene he at once gave Hartmann an
emetic. The ambulance was then sum
moned and the suicide sent to the Harbor
Jlospttal. Drs. Thorne and Bauer worked
over the man for two hours and at one
time it looked as though his life would
be saved. The poison had secured too'
great a hold upon him, however, and he
died at 6 p. m. Â° . r v

REJECTED BY HIS LOVE
Attorney -Bert Schlesinger of the law
firm of Denson & Schlesinger announced
yesterday that he had been retained by
Julian Biddulph Arnold to resist the pend
ing proceedings for Arnold's extradition
to London to be tried on a charge of
embezzling $18,000.
Mr. Arnold has informed his attorney
that friends in London have advised him
that his creditors are using the proceed
ings in extradition as a threat against
his father, 0 Sir Edwin Arnold, to compel
Sir Edwin to pay the $18,000, otherwise
he and his' family 'would be disgraced by
the taking of Julian in Irons to London
on a felony charge.
0 Mri Schlesinger has addressed a mem
orial to the Secretary of State at {Wash

him and contending that the difficulty be~
tween the" prisoner and his creditors
ariÂ«es out of a business transaction with
which" criminar courts can have nothing
to do. He asserts ihat- the money was
placed with Mr. Arnold, not as an Indi
vidual, but as a member, of the firm' for
the purpose of investment; = that Mr. Ar

Within the rcped area of Chinatown
Wong Jueng. a Chinese Interested in a
gambling house located over the theater
on Washington street, was shot and killed
last night by an unknown assassin. The
crime was committed in .the third story of
the building at 845. Washington street
about 11 o'clock. Two men, 'Wong Mow
and Dong Chue, have been arrested and
charged with the crime, but the evidence
ngalnFt them is not considered strong.
The murderer and his accomplices evi
dently lured their victim to his doom. The
plans laid by them â¢were so complete that
they made their escape over .adjoining
buildings, and were probably far from the
scene of the crime before the officers ar*
rived. .... ..; i { -uili : l
The room. from which the shot was fired
leads into a hall on the third floor of the
building, which is occupied by Japanese.
This particular apartment was vacant,
but Its door had recently been made fast
by three bars. A bar protecting a window
in the rear of the apartment had been
sawed out, that the criminals might leap

One theory is that the shooting was the

the Chinese claim that the shot was fired
by Japanese/ Jueng is said to have excit

Captain Welsh had commanded her for
thirteen years. Neither cargo nor hull

and as soon as this was done nre and

then nlainly seen that the cargo of lum

hand pumps and buckets, but the fire
pained on us. More holes were cut in the
engine-room floor and all hands were
busy throwing water on the flames. Not
a man llinchtd and every one worked as.
! he had never worked In his life before.
I But it was of no ayail. The tire gained
I every instant and we could hoar it roar

"Suddenly the flames broke out through
the cJfcfk amidships and In a few minutes
the deckhouse was In flames. A few sec
onds later the whole body of the ship was
afire and the flames were mounting a3
high as the mainstay. I then gave the
orders to get the boats ready. I saw that
they were properly provisioned and plenty
of water and all of the men's clothing
that we could pet was put in. It was now
10 a, m. and wft had been fighting the

nearly lost their live?. Th^y. went into

it was some little time before they re

March 8. Aftetf considerable privation
the crew landed on the Marquesas islands.
From. ArJapa they were sent to Papeete,
Tahiti, by the French Consul. Some of
the xnea elected to make their home in the
Islands, others werÂ» sent to New Zealand
by the British Consul, while the captain
and five of the crew arrived here yester
flay on the brig Galilee. Captain James
Welsh is still eufferir.g from the efft^ts of
- the exposure In the open boats, but he
hopes that the bracinc air of California
Â¦wlU ma_ke him as well as ever in a few
days.
Captain Welsh had a peculiar experience
In Tahiti. He vras born and raised in
Scotland, but went to Chile when he .was
a little over Â£0 years old. . For forty yeura
he has made his home In Valparaiso and
l.:5 wife and family there now. His
wife is a Chileno and he has always been
looked upon as a citizen of that country. ;
Th>- Brtush Consu} at Papeete considered j
him a Chileno. but the Chilean Consul j
could not see it in that light and in conse- |
quence Captain Welsh had to get to San
Francisco us best he <iould. Luckily Cap-;
tain IHnsmore of the Clailiee took in the
Situation and offered Captain Welsh â¢ a
1 a>?age to the coast.. . ;
"The 6th of the month has figured very
prominently fa the log of the last voyage !
of thf liindostaJi." saJiJ Captain Welsh j
yesterday. "We left: Port Blakeley on I
De Â¦ ::Â¦â¢'. Â«er S with a cargo of lumber. Off j

heavy iiorihwester and the ship sprang
a leak. On January & we put Into San
Francisco in distress. After the neces
;-ary repairs had been made we sailed
again on February Â£ and on March 8 the
ship w;is ljurned to \he water's edge.
"When we left San Francisco there was
ii Â¦ :< w Â«if tweiity-one a^l told aboard and
one passenger. Our cargo. was composed,
of pine lumber and was well stowed. After
the xug cast us off all plain sail was set

cover taken off and went down into the

it.- and I had to be hauled back on deck.:.
*'Aft<T the hatch covers had been put on
fcujn I overhauled the donkey engine
room, nut could find no trace of fire there.
Th^n I ordered the carpenter to cut a hole
through the dock forward of the boiler
had taken Into consideration the improve
ments provided in the bond issue.
"I make It a rule never to count chick
ens before they are hatched," was the
ready reply. :
The Mayor suggested that the engineers
were not employed unless there was work
to do. ' -
"Then why do you tie up the money
to pay them for full time?" asked Center.
Judge A. W. Thompson asked for an ap
propriation to bltuminize Valencia street
from Sixteenth to Twenty-second street.
He thought that some of the tax-eaters
ought to be cut off to benefit the tax
payers. '
Gustave Schnce of the Federation Mis
sion Improvement Clubs found fault with
the expenditures in the Recorder's office,
the item of $1500 for the collection of per
sonal taxes, the item of $^000 for new fur
niture and that of $6000 for printing mu
nicipal expenditures.
Attorney J. S. Reed made a plea for
J.VI.OOO to purchase the three .lots behind
the new City Hall.
A representative of the South End
School District asked for a new school
house, the old one bring twenty-three
years old. unsafe as a building, dangerous
to the health of the pupils and inadequate
to the school population. The Mayor told
him the bond issue provided for repairs.
Heed Denounces Popper.
Max Popper was the next to take the
floor, but he had scarcely made his bow
when Supervisor Reed Interrupted him.
"I object to this man addressing this
board," he said. In an excited tone of
voice, "and move your Honor that he be
refused the fioor. By his own confession
he has bribed former boards and la a
felon. I can prove what I say. and every
member of this board knows that I am
right. He is not fit to address this hon
orable board."
"Every man in this board." interrupted
the Mayor, "is personally responsible for
what he says. Mr. Popper, as a citizen
ami taxpayer, has a right to be heard
hem I refuse. Mr. Reed, to entertain
your motion. Mr. Popper may proceed."
"Then I refuse to remain in the hall
while he speaks." said Reed, and left the
chamber, slamming the dor behind him.
Popper palmly faced the members of the
board and said, without the slightest
sign of ft-ellng:
"While I scarcely consider It necessary.
I will deny the charges of the man who
has just left the hall. My word Is as
good as his in this community any day."
Popper: then went through the budget
Item by itÂ»m and suggested where saving
could be: : made. . He considered food In
spection ; as proposed unnecessary, as a
simpler method would prove less costly
and more satisfactory. The office of su
pervising physician at the County Hos
uital was not provided for In the charter
and was unnecessary. Salaries have been
raised contrary to law. Too much Is paid
for advertising, in hjs opinion. The burial
of alleged United States volunteers Is not
under proper supervision and Is under sus
picion. . Â¦
Telephones Cost Too Much.
The Item for telephones Is out of all pro
portion. In Chicago that expense has
been, reduced to J2250J and ought to be less
than that here. Three stations might be
established fn the City Hall. The system
of water charces Is all wrong and too
costly. Savings might be made In the
maintenance of the Magdalen Home and
non-sectarian schools for children depend
ent on the city, as the State stands half
of the. expense. The Coroner's office ought
to he looked Into, as the expenses have
doubled in ten years. Nearly all depart
ments have been given additional clerks
for no- good reason. The secretary of the
Superior Judges gets $1SOO per year for
copying the jury list once a year. .The
expenses of the Grand Jury havcheen
needlessly increased.
Popper agreed with Mr. Center In re
gard to. the Board of Works. He called
attention to the fact that the local Fire
Department costs $250,000 more than that
of any similar department In cities of the
same size in the United States. The item
of election expenses and registrationâ
$114.000â is out of all proportion. Else
where the cost has been very much less.
Finally, a. saving of at least $5 per horse
per. month ought to be made in the Police
Department. p
At the Conclusion of Popper's address
Mayor Phelan apologized to him for the
treatment he had received at the hands
of Supervisor Reed.
"The apology is quite unnecessary,"
said Popper, "for I am abundantly able
to take care of myself."
E. Kimball of the Xew Potrero district
asked for a new $.7)00 lire house for his
district, a $52,000 school house and $10 000
f0I VÂ» s Â«"*'er; aIso the removal of the City
and County Hospital.
. E. P. E. Troy also addressed the board
on. the subject of saving In the cost of
water by reducing the number of hy
fhafsu^fy'ffim 5 Cl Â° Sel> ' lnt Â° the P ' peS
THE tax-payers made a combined at
tack upon the tax-eaters last night
by appearing before the Board of
Supervisors and asking that the tax
levy be reconstructed so as to eliminate
the extravagance shown by the salary
lists In every department, that the money
thus saved might be applied to the Im
provement of streets, building of sanitary
school houses, construction of needed
sewers and the extension of fire protec
tion to every portion of the city.
Supervisor C. "\V. Reed took occasion to
make a savage attack upon Max Popper,
who appeared as a representative of the
Federation of Mission Improvement Clubs.
Reed demanded that Popper be ruled oft
the floor, on tbe ground that he was -a*
self-confessed briber of former boards and
therefore a self-confessed felon. Mayor
Phelan refused to entertain the motion
and Reed left the chamber^ Popper's talk
was well . received and the Mayor after
ward publicly apologized to him for the
treatment he^had received. Another stir
ring incident was an attack made by At
torney J. E. O'Donnell upon President F.
W. Dohrmann In connection with the item
of street sprinkling. He'.declared that
Dohrmann had secured the appropriation
of $15,000 for his own personal gain.
Outside of the incidents mentioned the
session was a quiet one. The Supervisors
seemed to be in the mood to resent all
suggestions and left the impression that
the attack made upon the tax levy would
be without results. The Maywir took ft upon
himself to reply to nearly every complain
ant and the burden of his song was ever
that "It cost much more under former ad
ministration." -Several times he sprung
the bond Issue scheme upon a speaker
who demanded -Â«ome Improvement, but
was somewhat disconcerted when Max
Popper questioned the right of the board
to provide taxation to make a fund for
bonds not yet voted for.
Merchants Get the Benefit.
Attorney J.E.O'Donneir was the first
one to respond to the invitation to tax
payers to spt>ak. He said that he repre
sented some widows and orphans who
were interested in the street-sprinkling
business because their livelihood depended
upon it. : He called attention to the fact
that the tax levy appropriating $15,000 for
sprinkling streets in the business district
for the. benefit of men who lived outside
of the city, escaped jury duty and busl
j ness licenses. He considered street
sprinkling a luxury and that if the city
was going to spend money for it outside
j merchants ought to get .some of the bene
' fits as well as downtown merchant*
I "This city." he continued, "has
tract with the City Street Improvement
â¢(.ompany by which it agrees to sprinkle
these very streets until January next at
I Its own expense. F. \V. Dohrmann owns
I the major portion of the stock In that
I company. He came In here and convinced
the last board that the sprinkling of b'f
tumlnlzed streets was dangerous to horses
and put a stop to street sprinkling. Now
he has succeeded In having this 115.000 set
aside by the city to sprinkle these streets
: again. He has gone further, and hnd an
ordinance passed to kerp off the streets
all watering carts that do hot come up to
the Studebnker standard, because his com
pany has those wagons and these Widows
and orphans : have not. He would s'hotilder
the expense ;ori the taxpayers." .. ...,Â¦
Mayor Phelan asked what proof he Jmd
that Dohrmann controlled the stock of the
City Street Improvement Company, and
O Donneil replied that he was prepared to
produce the proof when necessary.
. ' Mayor Defends Dohrmann. ;
;V: - :I : merely want to give my testlmonv
here now." replied the Mayor, "that *I
consider that Mr. Dohrmanu has acted
honorably and as a disinterested party"
George L. Center, representing the Fed
eration of Mission Improvement Clubs
attacked the Items of the Board of Public
Works in the buderet. He asked the board
t" inquire carefully Into the reason why
the expenditure of $219,000 in public im
provements required an outlay of J51 000
In salaries. He called attention particu
larly to expense Item of $49,000 for engi
neers' salaries. ;;'â¢Â¦:. Â¦ Â¦/.,..-.. â¢.
Mayor Phelan asked if the salaries
were too large and what Mr. Center would
suggest as a remedy. He said that the
expenses of the Street Department had
been cut down wonderfully.
â¢: "If there was ' anything that made us
get away from the old condition." replied
Center, "It was the Street Department.
We have no remedies to suggest. You
are the responsible parties. We have
elected, you to office, and .'It Is your busi
ness to' run this city on a business .basis.
We point out the evils, you must find the
remedy. I think you have a top-heavy
system of engineering.". .'Â¦'>Â¦

irg the quarantine, but the city refused
to pay it. The court, however, decided
that i't was legally compelled to pay the
demand.
"It is a fact." said Bennett, "that
plague makce terrible ravages when the
people -are not properly nourished."
The board decided to submit the legal
phase of the question to its attorney, J.
J. Dunne, and in the meantime the rep
resentatives of the Chinese Six Companies
are to submit an estimate of the daily
Siipply of food necessary for indigent per
sons in Chinatown, which estimate will
be presented to the Board of Supervisors
for action.
Judge Maguire then made an application
on behalf of the Chinese Six Companies
that three white physicians. Dr. Power.
Dr Hodghead and Dr. Pillsbury. be per
mitted to make an independent examina
tion of the body of Hang Hun. who died
two days ago. Dr. O'Britn explained that
the application had been made to him
verbally the day before, but had been re
fused ;bccause the body had been disin
fected, covered with chemicals before em
balming and then oncased i:: a metallic
box. He said that there was danger in
reopening the case, but that certain tis
sues of the dead man had been turned
over to Dr. Cables, who was understood
to represent the Six Companies. %
At this point Dr. Baum interposed a
etrer.uous objection against giving out any
tissues of suspected cases to outside phy
sicians. He did not o;:>poeo giving out re
eults. but everything else was tacrcd to
the board itself.
Judge Maguire then a-sked that the
reefssary permission be triven to the threo
physician? to co-operate with the bacteri
ologist of the board in examining suspect
ed ccsfs. Dr. LJazet, however, moved that
only one medical man be allowed to take
part in the autopsy and subsequent lnvcs
riga.tions. Maguire paw no detriment in
dioavir.g threr reputable physicians to
enaiyze the plague tissues providing they
would, take the inoculation, which they
had volunteered to do. Dr. Daum con
tended that if the board allowed three
outside physicians to investigate, others
would want to do likewise.
"We have one bacteriologist," Bald Ba
set.
"Cut you submit the germs to other
r>a/-teriol<::gists." said Bennett. "There are
10,C"Â» people likely to suffer from the dis
oaLse.~ anÂ» 1 can sec no reason why reputa-
Jjle physicians should not be consulted."
The hor.rd then voted on Bazefs motion,
Â¦with the result that only . one outside
physician. Dr. PiUmtmiT, will be taken into
the confidence of the board.
Durir.g the discussion Dr. Kellogg eald
that there was only enough room in the
autopsy* room for one more r>hysicta.n, but
the board appointed Dr. K. F. Donnelly to
be his assistant, at $100 per month. C. E.
Grant -was appointed assistant chemist, at

Attorjiey Richnrdson. representing the
Pacific Fruit Packing Company, asked the
I'oard to take wkp action on its petition
whereby the factory on Stockton street
would be allowed to run.
"If we .ire quarantined it means the
Ins? of K5BXXM) to us this year," said
Richardson. "VVe have 5125.0-/) in contracts
to fill and the fruit is arriving in im
mense quantities and will spoil if we are
not allowed to pack it. We omploy a
number of vhitt- girls and some Chim
nen. The latter we are willing to dis
charge except the experienced cookers of
fruit. These we win keep on the- prem
ises and wp promise to comply with any
regulations the beard may impose. I fear.
however, that the white cirls will not sub
mit to inoculation and that difficulty will
have* to be met in cthc:- ways. We will
jyit ourselves under strict sanitary ln-
Fprctinn. but we earnestly ask that the
quarantine be raised insomuch as it will
allow us to continue operations. We â¢will
not ship one pound of the packed fruit
out of the city."
The board was impressed with the grav
!ty of the plaint of the packing company
and will meet this afternoon at 4 o'clock
to take some action.

EUREKA. May 31â The action of Health
Officer Harris in quarantining all vessels
arriving from San Francisco has provoked
a storm of indignation here. The Health
Officer, acting he claims under general or
ders, ordered that all vessels before land
ing at the wharves must be searched for
Chinese and Chinese goods. : These In
structions were given to the : agents of
shipping companies here a week ago.
"When the steamer Pomona arrived on
Tuesday the Health Officer went down
the bay in a launch flying'the quarantine
flag and attempted to board the vessel.
Captain Parsons Ignored the Federal of
ficer and steamed by him, landing at the
wharf. This afternoon J. R. Baird, local
agent of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany, received the following ": telegram
from Goodall. Perkins & Co.: Â¦'-
"As no such legulations are in force at
any other port along the coast, and as it
!s impracticable for this company to op
erate its steamer under the regulations,
we will withdraw the service entirely un
til further orders."
. As soon as the contents of the telegram
became r?c-neraily known steps were taken
to hold an in.lipnation meeting at the
Chf-mber of Commerce rooms this evening.
If the Pomona is withdrawn from this
route It leaves Eureka practically with
out connection with the outside world, as
all Pteam schooners except the steamer
North Fork have been taken off the route
to engage in the Alaskan trade.' = â¢
The action of Goodall. Perkins & Co. In
taking off the steamer Pomona from this
route is directly attributable to a resolu-.
tion of the city Bdard of Health which
waÂ« passed to-day. It roads as follows:
"The Eureka Beard of Health: -directs tha
Health Officer to quarantine and fumigate
all vessels from San Francisco. -.It directs
the Health Officer to hold all passengers
in quarantine not bearing a Certified bill
of health from the Health Officers in San
Francisco, saying they have been under
inspection for ten days prior to their de
parture from the port of San Fraricit-co.
AH baggage or tonnage must bear qt;ar
antinc seal to be allowed to land without
disinfection. The board directs all vessels
to be held not loss than three days after
arrival. E. J. Ruddock, Health Officer."

HAVANA, May 31.â Army officers In
Havana are Interested in a movement, to
vindicate the honor of the military admin
istration by demanding the recall of an
army officer from his present post to face
either a court-martial or criminal charges
in the courts. This officer was a member
of General Ludlow's. staff during the lat
ter's term as military governor. "The
charge is made that he used his official
position to extort money from various
persons. Specific allegation is made that
he levied tribute, said to amount to $4D00,
on Havana dairymen in consideration of
not 'enforcing the military order requiring
them to remove their cows from the city
to the country. Other charges made re
late to his alleged .acceptance * of bribes
from horse dealers whose animals were
suspected of. having glanders; to petty
extortions levied on persons whose houses
were subject to plumbing and other sani
tary requirements; to blackmailing wine
merchants, whose goods were : subject' to
sanitary inspection, and to various other
exactions. The accused officer la also
charged with having compelled Havana's
hotel-keepers to board himself and his
family free under -penalty of making ex
tensive plumbing and other . repairs in
their places.
Overwhelming evidence was presented,
and was not controverted, but the Wash-
Said to Have Levied Tribute

Ington authorities were afraid If the ac
cused officer were compelled to submit to
a court-martial this Isolated scandal
would be misinterpreted as involving the
whole American military administration.
So they decided to act without publicity,
and the officer was quietly transferred to
the Philippines. , /

"What causes them?.
Xothing but irregular working of thÂ«
bowels. When a nauseous mass of undi-
gested food ferments in the Intestines in-
stead of beius passed out of the body its
pressure congests the blood vessels and
produces all kinds of pilesâ bleeding, blird

Nothing -will cure them except to go at
the cause, make the boweb regruFar and
then tone up the intestines so they can"
keep regular. Only a strong intestinal

at-his home in San Rafael. Deceased
had been connected with Parrott & Co.

been ailing for the last few days his sud

of neuralgia of the heart.
The deceased was well known and high

cases to enable the crew to live comfort
ably at the bottom for a day or longer, be
sides serving other purposes in the opera
tion of the boat. Liquid air may possibly
be serviceable for such purposes.
Methods of Propulsion.
The submarine boats of a century ago
were propelled while under water by oars
or a wheel. The oars projected through
the sides with water-tight joints of oiled
leather, and could be feathered or turned
edgewise on the return stroke. \\ hat
kind of a wheel was used Is not clear, but
it probably was not a screw. Since the
invention of the screw, however, all boats
have used it. In some of the earlier
screw boats no motor was provided, and
the Â«*crew had to be turned by hand. The
boat used with ultimate success by the
Confederate forces in the Civil War was
propelled in this way. Xow. two forms
naut, the name which Lake has given to
each of his boats, is intended to navigate
on the surface or on the bottom. Sur
face navigation is provided for in the us
ual way. For progressing on the bottom
there are three wheels, one of which
serves for steering. The other two are
worked by the motors and may be as
sisted by the screw.
The latest Argonaut, launched last sum
mer, has a regular yacht body built above
the submarine boat, so that when sail
ing on the surface the crew can live r:s
comfortably as on any surface boat.
When it is desired to go to the bottom
the crew retire3 Into the metal shell,
which Is closed, and anchor weights a.re
lowered uritli they ' rest on the bottom.
Water ballast is then taken in and the
anchor chains are wound up. pulling th â¢
boat down. By regulating the amount of
watep admitted the boat may- be- made to
rest on the wheels with any desired pres

The .'school census 'report for 'the year
ending- June' Â»>. 1900. was filed yesterday
with the Board of .Education by Chief
Marshal Elbert. It shows a total of 78.554
census children between a and 17 years of
ago, an increase of 2262 over last year.
As the State pays an average of $9 for
each eligible school child the School De
partment of this citfy and county will be
enriched by over $700,000, an increase of
tC.O.COO over last year.
: The board extended a. vote of thanks to
Chief Census Marshal ;Elbert for the effi
cient manner in which he had conducted
the census and for his good work in
adding over 3000 names to the census roll.

or plunging boat. Several of the modern
boats can be steered In this way. among
them those of Nordenfelt. Zede. Peral and
Holland. In the Goubtt, Baker and Tuck
boats the angle of the propellers can be
changed, thus changing the course. â¢ An
other Ingenious method of submergence is
by a change in volume, which may be ac
complished by the use of water-tight pis
tons. This, however. Is only a particular
way of admitting water ballast.
Although much popular enthusiasm has
recently been aroused in France by the
performances of two or three boats, we
may leave them without further descrip
tion and pass at once to the consideration
of the boats which have the most Interest
for usâ those of Holland and of Lake.

There hare been three Holland boats.
The first was a very small one. holding but
one man. who propelled the â¢ boat by
working the screw with his feet while half

The boat was only two fert high and less
than two feet wide. The second, known as
the Plunger, the largest of the three, ta
complicated bv a great deal of machinery.
The third is the one of which we have
heard so much in the last three years.

The study of submarine navigation Is
far from new. ' Within the last few years,
however,' It has been revived and pursued
with renewed energy, especially in the
United States and in France, and t.he per
formances of the boats have been followed
by the public with great Interest.

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
Attorney Lezinsky, Chastised by Opposing Counsel, Later
Father Yorke Resents Statement That
Ten Thousand Voters Are on
. Level of Followers of :
: ~ : the Mahdi. . '
Henry Austin. Adams lectured in Met
ropolitan Temple last evening upon
"America's Debt to the Catholic Church."
Rev. Peter C. Torke also spoke briefly
following the address by Mr. Adams. The
exercises opened with organ music by
Robert Harrison. Catholic clergymen ajid
prominent laymen occupied the stage. The
entrance of thÂ© speakers was the signal
for long continued applause. The audi
ence was large.
Father Yorke introduced Mr. Adams,
speaking briefly and paying humorous
tribute to the orator's lecture on theaters,
which was calculated to induce even grim
Bishops to make less severe rules about
theater-going.
Mr. Adams said that as he crossed the
mountains coming to California his fore
most wish was to hear Father Yorke,
whose thunders had been heard on the
Atlantic Coast. He was grateful to Rev.
Mr." Parrish, who had telegraphed to his
(Adams') old friend Johnson. He would
have bet dollars to doughnuts that he
could tell what Johnson's answer would
be. The speaker read part of a letter
from his friend Bishop Moreland, who
wrote: "More power to your elbow, old
man, even if I can't congratulate you on
your conversion." At the end of the let
ter was a statement that "Parrish is an
honest, conscientious fellow."
Mr. Adams said that he took Bishop
Moreland's word about Mr. Parrish. He
could not deal with the latter directly
for diplomatic relations had been severed.
He would have to follow the example of
great powers that deal through third par
ties and take the public into his confidence
and so invite Mr. Parrlsh to dine with
him at a restaurant and there bury the
hatchet.
After this pleasantry Mr. Adams en
tered upon his theme and carried the au
dience with him for an hour. He said
that Catholics discovered America, and
two men, who were really Tiamed Joe
Maguire and John Moran, although' they
were disguised under Spanish and Italian
names, were the first to land in th irty
of Columbus. . By right of prior \.
sion, unless it could be shown that they
had ceded their rights, the Magulres and
Morans were entitled to hold the country
still. '
Much of the discourse was given to cen
sure of "namby-pamby dude Catholics."
Mr. Adams recounted historical facts â
the writing of Magna Charta and its sig
nature by Catholics, and said that when
religious persecution was rife In the colo
nial days in New England and Xew York
Catholics alone were tolerant. The
speaker quoted' Charle3 A. Dana's state
ment that 52 per cent of the Revolutionary
Army were Catholics, and traced the his
tory of the United States, and said that
while it was true' that many non-
Catholics looked upon Catholics with sus
picion of being un-American In their sym
pathies. It was the fact that Catholics had
ever been ready to die for this Govern
ment. It was strange if they meant
some time to destroy it. The basis of mod
ern civilization was the home. The Cath
olic church, which opposed the evil of di
vorce, was the friend and supporter of
the home.
Father Yorke said that Mr. Adams had
struck the keynote of the Catholic Truth
Society when he had said that Catholics
needed to get a Rood opinion of them
selves. Something had been- done toward
telling the Catholics of San Francisco
that there was some difficulty for those
of their faith in America, as they were
in a minority and could not introduce the
thumbscrew and the inquisition yet.
(Laughter.) Catholics had been looked
down upon so much that some of them
actually believed that they had no
rights. It was an old song and an old
story, but there was need for repetition
every day that Catholics had as many
rights as any other people in the United
States and that they would enjoy them
only when they depended on themselves
to secure them. That was an old saying,
but there was a new variation.
There were Catholics with axes to grind
and men with no axes to grind, and the
latter did not care who was in the City
Hall or who drove the pound wagon. A
small minority of Catholics cared for pol
itics because it meant bread and butter
for them. They had as good a right as
any one, when bread and butter was po
ing down the line, to a share of it. The
"Catholic church existed for the great ma
jority of men and not for the minority.
The tail did not wag the' doer. XVhen poli
ticians thought to use the church they
were going too far. any man said
that 10,000 voters were on a level with the
followers of the Mahdi. were fools and
idiots if they fai.ed to recognize, his trans
cendent ability, it was presuming too
much to suppose that human nature
would not resent it. If any party should
take" up such a man after that it would
be because of belief that those 10.000 vot
er? had sunk so low that they had no
self-respect.'
It was well Ui come down from general
facts to particulars, the speaker said. He
knew that there were some men at the
City and County Hospital who could not
lecture on tapeworms without speaking
against Catholics. Courage enough was
needed to . kick slanderers downstairs.
There was no Christianity where there
\^as no manliness, and no manhood with
out self-respect. The thing that Catho
lics needed most of all was self : respecL
It did not become gentlemen to sneak in
through the kitchen. Men whÂ« stood in
the street and knocked at the front door
until they were admitted went into the
parlor and for thorn and for their chil
dren were the mansions of the King's
house.

New York Stock Market.
JCEW YORK. May 31.â The Mock market J
struggled for awhile with uncertainty ' and j
erathetic indiJTerer.ee, but toward the latter i
Fart cf the day took on mere aggressive j
ftrcnsrth ar.d closed with a greater appearance !
of activity an! vital force than It has shown j
for many days paft. The Impulse -was up- 1
Â¦ward frcm the cpeslnir on a> number of in- |
fluer.ces accumulated over the holiday. The j
one of wUest bearing and Interest was the \
reported capture cf Johannesburg and the !
readiness cf the Beers In Pretoria to surrender, j
The buying for foreign account here, however. ,
did not exceed 1S.O0O fhar^s. and the tone of I
the New York market became reactionary after j
the openljiK on prof.t-taklng and en dlsap- |
l>olntm<>nt that no prÂ»atpr strength wu Fhown. j
The effect may thus be said 10 have been very I
Fm*ill and momentary unless some of the "iter!
buying was In expectation of a more active de- |
mand for stocks from foreign sources. The
later strength was conspicuous In the South
western and Western grangers and. is doubt
less attributable to the prospects of the winter
Â¦wheat crop. Atchison preferred and Hurllng
ton were easily the leaders, the former'gain
ing 2 end the latter 2>4 on large, transactions.
Tbe strength elsewhere in the railroad Met
I^rove-d to be !n sympathy with this 'movement
an<1 was net widely disseminated. Another
eource of Etrength was the dc-mand for Pteel
BtOCfcl which rose at one time from 1 to J
points all around. Later more hopeful views
of the trade outlook were quoted frcm author
ities In the iron trade and reports were cur
rent cf large contract* for export. In Sugar
the main spurt wt-.s in sympathy with the un
official quotation pf-tablish^d by restless specu
lators outside the exchange during the holi
day. - Thv opening' price at 120 was the best
and before the final rally In sympathy with
the othÂ«?r strength In the market the stock
rflarsed to within a small fraction of Tues
day's cicse In spite of the credence given to
the reports of taking over a part of the op
position refmrries in the interest of the Amer
ican Comjiiiiy and a further advance of 10
points In the prire of ref.ned sugar.

EATING IN 30LIVIA.
Stoves of the Bolivian Indiar.3 are cu
rious thing?. A hole is dug in the ground
about eigtÂ» f eeri inches dee~> and a foot
square and over this is built a roof of
clay with holes of different sizes to re
ceive the various cookins pots. Roasting
Is done on spits passed through the holes,
so that the meat comes out very much
smokeii unless great care 13 taken to have
only lÂ» v e coals at the bottom of the oven.
The national dish and the common food
of the masses is "chupe," a sort of first
cousin to the Irish stew. It is a conglom
erate composed of irregular constituents
from the animal and vegetable kingdoms
--a mess of mutton and 3'jch other meats
as are available; chicken, flsh. fruits, po
tatoes, carrots, barley, corn. rice, onions
yams. etc.. chopped up. highly seasoned
with peppers and herbs and stewed to a
consistency of porridge.
What happens to be left from one menl
simmers in the pot until the next. If the
fire goes out the chupe is allowed to cool
but it is warmed uiÂ». arain and a new
supply of the Ingredients added to the
water-logged and greasy stuff for the next
meal. In the cities at the hotels and
restaurants wherf there are French or
Swiss cooks, the chupe is savory and pal
atable, but the farther you go from tho
centers of civilization the worse it gets
One cats It first under protest then
frcm necessity, and only to escape starv-i
tion: but finally the stomach rebels a^i
you limit your diet to boiled ejrsrsVa-fe

FANCY PILLOW SALE
FOR COOKING SCHOOL
i in the cars was almost unbearable. Human be-
I Ings have to breathe that foul air/ and. of
j course, it Is unhealthy.
FRANK -V. DODD, Alameda Land Company
â1 have notireff a great falling off in the de
mand for house? from people who usually come
1 to Alameda during- the summer, and I attribute
; it to the recent wrecks on the narrow-gauge
j and the lack of accommodations. People will
i not come to a town If they think there is
danger In the travel* If they had reasonable
assurance that they could get to their homes
j In | safety and at Â¦ regular hours It would be
I all rlRht, but under present conditions no <Â«uch
assurance Is given.
THE ALAMEDA ARGUS said this evening:
"The people of Alcmeda should no longer delay
fgoing before the Southern Pacific management
j and demanding better narrow-gauge service.
j I.,aFt. Saturday's train-running was almost the
! la=t straw. Commppcing with the heavy travel
â¢! home In the afternoon, the people were put
i to all sorts of Inconvenience and annoyance
J : One trip consumed 'an hbur and forty mlutes
Â¦ Kvery train was iate. Passengers had to wait
at the mole for the next train. Weak and
puny enjfineR got Mailed, air-'orakes gave out

gerS...who had. waited half an hour had time
to come up and get aboard."
Prominent Citizens Give Their: Experiences
Upon Some of the Southern Pacific Com- /
pany's Slow-Moving Cars. /
I Â«yT? LAMEDA, May 31.â Narrow-gauge
j I \\ trains continue to run between
It <\ . terminals with a charming indif
ference as to time and connection.
All day yesterday and to-day passengers
were subjected to the same exasperating
delays which for a month past have pro
voked them to the aggravation point at
| every attempt they have made to do the
! cross-the-bay trip within a reasonable
time. Trains are frequently half an hour
late. \^-' ';.
No apparent effort has been made or ts
likely to be made for better accommoda
tion. Some of the trainmen try to ex
plain away the long- delays by saying that
they are under orders not to run their
trains over eighteen miles an hour, as the
management is fearful of a disaster
greater than any that has yet taken place.
"These recent accidents have got me
scared." said an old engineer to-day. "1
have an uncanny feeling every time I get
aboard my engine which I never felt in
all the years 1 have been railroading. 1
do not care so much for myself as 1 do
for the trainload of people I am pulling
behind me. We ought not to be blamed
for running under slow headway and
creeping around curves. The greatest
thing to fear is an accident when we're
running tender ahead, and when she's
running that way there Is less chance
of us stopping the train and get
ting ourselves out whole, as we have less
control of the engine. Turntables should
be put at each end of the road at once."
Not only do the trains creep along the
most of the time nowadays but some of
the m do not have vitality enough to even
creÂ»p. La5t Saturday the Southern Pa
cific practiced its greatest imposition on
the commuters of Alameda. The 5:15
train from San Francisco, consisting of
twelve heavily loaded coaches, was pulled
by one -of the company's little old-style,
days-of-'4S engines, all the big machines
having been sent out with picnic trains
to the Santa Cruz Mountains. When the
little engine had managed by puffs and
groans to get the train to the first sta
tion On the run. to Alameda, it suddenly
acquired "that tired feeling" and "lay
down." The passengers had already stood
a delay of twenty minutes, and they were
not in an amiable frame of mind. They
spent the time while waiting for another
Â¦engine uttering imprecations upon the
railroad management. Then the relief
engine arrived and hooked on to the train
and continued the struggle, finally get
ting those on board to their destinations
an hour later than usual.-
Saturday evening conditions Were wors.e
than through the day. The 9:30 boat from
the city landed its passengers' on time,
but there was no narrow-gauge train in

The city of Alameda is the greatest
sufferer by these delinquencies of the
railroad. The city is- attractive as a home,
but accidents and poor traveling accom

who live on the line of the narrow-gauge
and use it in their daily trips to and from
San Francisco continue -to forcibly ex
press themselves on the demoralized ser-.

Julius Quinchard of Alameda made a
mistake In the presentation of ferry tick
ets to conductors in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company several months
ago, and now wants damages for the al
leged rough and humiliating treatment
accorded him by .the aforesaid conductors.
He brought suit to-day in the Superior
Court against the railroad company for
15000 damages, claiming that the em
ployes of the corporation hare injured
him in body and mind to that extent.
Quinchard's tribulations seem to have
arisen over his lack of knowledge that a
ferry ticket punched on a train connect
ing with a boat for the metropolis is not
good on the return trip across the bay. He
alleges that on March 23 he took passage
on one of the company's cars bound from
Alameda to San Francisco, and purchased
two tickets, one to carry him to his des
tination and the other for the purpose of
s-ecuring him conveyance back to the En
cinal City. On the way to the mole one
of the tickets was punched by the con
ductor of the train to signify that the
bearer had forfeited the right to further
be accorded the privilege of being car
ried on the local trains to the place of
transfer to the ferry steamer.
The mistake that caused all the trouble
was made when the plaintiff passed
through the gate on the way to the boat
and gave the doorkeeper the unpunched
ticket. After concluding his business in
San Francisco Quinchard traced his
steps homeward. Having already used
his unpunched ticket, he presented to the
doorkeeper the one from which the train
conductor had clipped a piece. He passed
through the door and was well on his way
to the steamer when the doorkeeper no
ticed that the cardboard had been
punched. .;._..Â¦..-â¢,
The unwary traveler alleges that at this
point the collector "wantonly, wickedly,
oppressively, maliciously, negligently,
carelessly, recklessly, viciously and with
force and violence did grab, shove, pull,
push, jam. Jerk, thrust, sling and eject
him from the door, at the same time yell

Miss Julia Calhoun wants- Frederick
Wundenberg to either make her his wife
or deed to her a house and lot on Filbert
street, near Tenth, which, she says, he
promised her last August. She claims
that Wundenberg wooed and won her with
the understanding that he was to give her
a two-story dwelling elegantly furnished
and equipped with every facility for the
embarkation into domestic life. The house
and lot and all were to be. the property
of Miss Calhoun after she became Mrs.
Wundenberg. It seems that Wundenberg
forgot his promise in regard to the mar
riage and also the property and now she is
invoking the aid of the law to bring her
recalcitrant lover to time â either to the
altar or to the Recorder's office. -
Miss Calhoun commenced suit . several
months ago against Wundenberg, making
the claim that he had asked her hand in
marriage and had been accepted. Before
his prorter of marriage, however, there
was talk of a home in which they were to
live. On condition that she would be
come his wife he was to convey to her
as her separate property a lot on Filbert
street, for the purenase of which he was
at that tilme entering into negotiations
with K. B. Rothenberg and his wife. A
handsome residence adorned the grounds
and the furnishings were all that could be
desired. The young woman says that she
was to have become the possessor of all
this should she consent to take the name
of Wundenberg.
The house, lot and furnishings were pur
chased and Wundenberg installed Mls3
Calhoun as mistress of the premises. For
a few months she remained in peaceful
possession, but shortly after Christmas
Wundenberg tried to coax her to leave
and when persuasion was of no avail
threatened to invoke the law. He ex
plained that he had changed his mind in
regard to the marriage and wanted his
presents back.
Then it was that Miss Calhoun, to pre
vent the loss of the property, as well as a
husband, retained Attorneys Crittenden
Thornton and Klley to bring suit against
her alleged promised husband to compel
himv-by process of law to carry out his
agreement. No answer was made by the
defendant and to forestall any action that
be might take Miss Calhoun to-day filed
an amended complaint covering such legal
points as were omitted in the original
document.

who was understood to have been agreed
upon as administrator by the widow, Mrs.

Applications for letters of administra
tion were filed to-day by Mrs. Wilkinson
and Public Administrator R. C. Hawes.
Additional features are thus added to the
contest.
It i? apparent that the widow favors
the appointment of M. E. McDonald, to
whom her stepdaughter. Mrs. Wilkinson,
objects. The l^ublic Administrator, seeing
a possible opoortunity for himself, filed
his application fo that he might stand a
chance for selection should the Probate
Court be unnbl* to decide whether the
widow of Brooks or his daughter shall
have control of the estate.

The argument in the Fresno rate case
was concluded by Frank II. Short late
yesterday afternoon and the case was sub
mitted to Judge Bahrs for decision.

Auditor Wells expressed his determina
tion yesterday to set aside sufficient funds
on his books for the payment of salaries
of the employes in the City Hall. He
will also reserve $125,000 for the purchase
of St. Mary's Park, which he has been
directed to do by.. a recent resolution of
the Board of Supervisors. Certain other
contracts made previous to June 1 will
also be provided -for, such as those for
light arid water.
"The salaries of men In the municipal
employ," said the Auditor, "are legal ob
ligations which the city is bound to settle,
I will therefore take proper precautions
to see that they are paid. This, of course,
applies only to those who are employed
by the month. Most of the day laborers
may have to go without their pay."
The Janitors in the City Hall were put
on half-pay yesterday. They will work
every other day and so receive only $26
at the end of the month. They complain
that this .is an injustice and that they
should have been given a vacation of two
weeks without pay and their contention
appears to be correct-
City Treasurer Brooks is in a quandary
regarding the order of the Supervisors to
preserve intact the St. Mary's Park fund.
He says that there is no such fund in
his vaults, but that it Is part of the gen
eral fund. Yesterdav there was exactly
1447,000 to the credit of the latter. Against
it there is now being drawn the salaries
for May and the fund will be considerably
depleted when all are paid. If the Audi
tor reserves the park fund and June sal
aries there will be little or nothing left
for other demands and as there will be
no. money available somebody will go
short. The treasurer also raises the point
that there is about $400,000 yet to be col
lected on delinquent taxes. Of thi3 about
$300,000 will revert to the general fund
after it is collected. He argues that St.
Mary's Park fund in any event will be
entitled only to a pro rata of the amount
actually collected in taxes. All other de
mands, he says, will be in a similar po
sition, as it is an absolute certainty that
at least $2Q0.CHÂ» will remain uncollected for
some time to come.
