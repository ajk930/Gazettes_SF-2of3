received the heartiest co-operation from

"They understand as thoroughly as we
do that it is to their best interest to as

know that we intend nothing. In the na
ture of "absolutism, and not. only wish to
extend ' to' them every possible feature of
free government for themselves but to
organize for them such a government and
to make possible for them Its administra

the fact that In the last few_ months we
have been very materially, assisted by the
higher class of Filipinos, who have done
everything In their power to give us In
formation which has been of very mate
rial value to. us. Americans. I think,, do
not realize what a wide difference' there
is in classes In the Philippine Islands.

question to expect the Filipinos to govern
themselves, and they, are giving us there
fore every assistance in their power in
our efforts to govern them. While, we
must ' expect that lawlessness in some
quarters will still continue for some time
Â¦to -come. We must also take into consid
eration that this lawlcssnere is not b>
any means representative of the general
condition of affairs in the . islands. Ne-'
Bros, for example, has a little republic
of its own. in which the natives partici
pate in ; the, government of the island and
have far more to say. and do in the ad
ministration of their own affairs than
they ever had under Spanish rule. In five
out of the six. provinces in Luzon. we have
established courts, In the conduct of
which natives participate.
v;".We are; thus- gradually but effectively
extending ; ' the ' protective ' influences of
to govern them | autocratically or - to
take away from them their liberties,
but to help them to govern them
selves and to protect them from the
depredations of their own lawless
elements and from any aggression by
a foreign power which would threaten
their dismemberment."
The Union League - Club received the
following courteous reply from General
Otis yesterday, regretting his Inability to
accept the tender of a reception to him:
"General Otis acknowledges with sin
cere thanks the honor conferred by the
Union League Club of San . Francisco in
the tender of a reception and regrets ex
ceedingly that "Wax Department orders
received by him , directing his departure
for- Washington at the earliest possible
date make it impossible for him to ac
cept this very flattering attention."
Terms.
American rule over all the islands, and I
am assured from my acquaintance with
the natives and from what 1 know ot
the conditions existing among them that
we shall receive their assistance in what
we are trying to do. They realize tha:
they n*ed a strong government and they
know that they cannot get that govern
ment lrom themselves. They understand
tuoroughiy that they must protect them
skives from themselves.
"The better educated classes and those
who possess property Interests have the
thought of nationality very strong within
them and they fear dlsmtmberment more
than they do anything else in connec
tion with their national life. Thev are
concerned therefore in what the United
fotates is doing, and the only reason that
any of them are still fighting is. as I have
been told by some of their leaders, that
they are struggling for better terms They
want to obtain from us the highest pos
sible degree of autonomy.
Natives Resisting to Win Better
Tribal.
"They are seeking for the greatest lil>
erty of action in the government of their
internal affairs, and they think that ir
they can hold out until our appraaching
Presidential election Is over they can
make their affairs so prominent an issu<Â»
in our political campaign as to secure
from either political party which may be
successful greater concessions. This is
positively tiie only reason that I know of
that explains the continuance of even dis.
organized warfare in the islands.
"As for the future policy of the United
States in reference to the Island3 there
can be no possible question. The United
States Is bound to' protect these people
against themselves and against other na
tions. There can be no evasion of that
duty, whatever the cause may have been
that imposed it upon us. We know that
the natives of the islands in their present
state of civilization cannot govern them
selves. We must therefore help them to
do so, at the same time glvlrg to them
every possible liberty of action in connec
tion with their own internal affairs. If we
observe this policy we will have the un
qualified support- and assistance of the
better educated and best J conditioned
classes in the islands.
.- ."'Among the. commas- people, who. as I
have said, are" living almost as tribes,
there Is still an antagonism to Americans.
It is over this class alone that Aguinaldo
has influence; and even among them his
influence is waning. I see by the news
paper reports this morning that it is be
lieved that Aguinaldo is dead. While, of
course, I know nothing of the facts, I
would not be surprised if the report were ,
true.
Aguinaldo's Influence Has Been
"I am convinced that Aguinaldo has
been constantly in the district in which It
Is reported he was killed. We have had a
good many troops there and have received
reports of his movements. It would not
surprise me therefore to know that he
in- dead. Whether dead or not, his influ
ence is not material.
"And now as to the general situa
tion in the Phil.ppines: I believe
that the condition ci affairs is such
that reasonably we could not expect
it to bs better. We have destroyed
any organized, or formidable opposi

OTIS, the former Military Gov
ernor cf the Philippines, was re
leased yesterday afternoon from
quarantine on the transport Meade and
: departed last night for Washington. The
distinguished soldier was met by General
Shafter and a military escort aod was
extended every courtesy which the lim
ited time of his stay in this city would
permit. During the afternoon he held
practically a levee at the Occidental
Hotel, accepting the congratulations and
receiving ihe good wishes of his fellow
clHcers.
General Otis is fatigued after his long
journey and service In the southern isl
ands, but will attempt to get no rest until
he has rendered his report to President
McKinley. In* an interview ye3terday af
terncon General Otis said' the United
States had ever}' reason for congratula
tion at the condition of affairs in the
Philippines, i He declared that even the
semblance of organized opposition has
disappeared and that for all practical
purposes the supremacy of the American
arms is complete.
He says that not only* are the troops
of the Federal Government being wel
comed by the tetter class cf Filipinos,
but the natives, recognizing their own
need of a strong government and admit
ting their own inability to secure it for
therr-selvcs. are accepting, with the best
grace all efforts that are being made to
establish iirm governments cn the differ
ent Islands. There can be no possible
question. General Otis says, that the
American people must accept the duty
which has ueen placed uprn ihem to give
the people of ilie Philippine Islands a
government strong enougn to resist the
lawlessness of unruly natives and the
aETgretslcns of outside nations.
America Must Accept a Solemn Duty.

may be, is bound bv a solemn dutj' to

from internal dissensions arid from any
possibility or" external interference by any
Oriental or Occidental nation. It is a
matter of no concern to me as a military
officer to discuss hovr we entered the isl
ands. Our entrance there vras an affair
over which I had no control and concern
ing which my opinipn can be of no pos
sible value.
"All I know is this, that we have upon
us the duty of protecting these people,
and we must perform It. Since last Feb

BOERS DECIDE TO
DEFEND PRETORIA
PRETORIA. June 2, via Lourenzo Mar
ques. June 4.â A marvelous reorganization
and rally of the burghers has taken place.
Kruger's unnecessary flight to Lydenburjf
and the taking away of gold bullion in
tended for coinage and leaving a majority
of. the officials unpaid engendered anger
among the burghers. Kryesraad nas as
sumed the powers of the Government and
the capital will be defended.
Five thousand men have left Standerton.
In the Â«outheast corner of the Transvaal,
for the Free State with the object of cut
ting the British lines of communication.
In an address to the burghers leading
Transvaalera said that with God'a help
the hour was still coming when Great
Britain would acknowledge the Independ
ence of the republics, as a tremendous
change had come over the situation in
regard to the war. Delarey was here for
a few hours to-day. He said Pretoria
would be defended to the utmost extent.
He went on to say there was every chanca
still to drive the enemy out of the ccun
try "^I^HHHHHHHHi
LOXDON*. June 5. 5:30 a. m.â Of offlci.il
intelligence regarding what Is trans
piring outside Pretoria there Is little
or nothing to say. Lord Roberts is
silent. Nevertheless, by piecing to
gether items from various corre
spondents It would seem that Lord Rob
erts' immense army is all employed north
of Johannesburg except one brigade,
which is at Johannesburg, and that six
columns are converging cn Pretoria.
An undated news agency message from
Pretoria, via Lcurenzo Marques June 4.
says: "Pretoria is now invested by the
British. No resistance will be offered. Tho
city will be surrendered by the Burgo
master as soon as a formal demand is
made."
This message purports to come in cipher.
President Kruger commands the telegraph
eastward from Pretoria, and telegraphic
news from Pretoria to Lourenzo Marques
has ceased, but the messengers of news
paper correspondents continue to pass to
and fro on the railway. The latest to ar
rive at Lourenzo Marques brings news of
events at the Boer capital down to a late
hour Friday night. At that time, accord
ing to these sources of Information, the
military leaders had quite recovered from
the panic and had determined to defend
the town. One message, which is dated
June 1, says:
"Pretoria is full of strange burghers, but
most of the commandos are laagered
outside. A great war council of generals
has Just concluded Its deliberations. The
decision as to the future military courso
has not been made known. Louis Botha
and Delarey sat in the council."
War Council to Defend Capital.
Another dispatch brought to Lourenzo
Marques by messenger and dated at Pre
toria Friday at midnight says:
"The war council assumes 'the powers
of^the Government. Its members declara
that the capital may still be successfully
defended. One commander declared, 'With
the help of God, the hour will come when
Great Britain will acknowledge the inde
pendence of the two republics. A tre
mendous change will yet come over tho
situation.*
"General Delarey said that Pretoria
would be defended to the utmost, adding,
'There Is every chance that we wiir yet
beat the enemy out of the country.* "
President Kruger Is somewhere to tha
eastward, but is in constant wire commu
nication with the leaders here. There is,
however, a deep feeling of anger against
him on account of what Is now called hid
unnecessary flight and because he and tha
officials took all the gold and left their
subordinates unpaid. The latest phase of
public opinion is a marvelous revival of
courage.
Kruger May Flee on a Warship.
From Lourenzo Marques comes a dia
patch, dated June 4, saying: Â¦ "It is
known that some great British movement
Is In progress outside of Pretoria. The
mysterious movements of President
Kruger's secretary and physician, partic
ularly their visit to the Dutch warship
Friesland, which is in the harbor here, has
aroused suspicions that Important per
sonages are expected."
The news from the minor theaters is
less cryptic. The Boer operations to
break Lord Roberts' communications
have been completely baffled and tha
Boer columns are in danger of being sur
rounded by the British forces at Ficks
burg. Senekal. Heilbron and Llndley.
General Rundle, instead of throwing
himself against the Boers intrenched at
Bedulphberg. moved toward Ficksburs
and established communication with
General Brabant. The Boers marched
parallel with Rundle, Intending to selza
a strong position on the Ficksburg read,
but General Rundle got there first. The
1500 Boers who were In this movement
are now reported to be going elsewhere.
It Was a Hard Fight.
The correspondents with General Run
die continue to point out the hardness of
tne fight of last Tuesday, but they fce
lleve that It will be the last' real resist
ance. Colonel Lloyd was thrice wounded.
Drummer Haynes, while aiding Colonel
Lloyd, was shot in the hand, which was
resting near the colonel's heart.
General Buller's guns throw a shell or
two toward the Boer positions in front of
him occasionally. General Baden-Powell
is still at Mafeking. General Hunter's
column Is marching unopposed Into the
Transvaal beyond Llchtenburg.
A new phase of the Anglo-Dutch ccn
fllct Is opening In Cape Colony. Tna
leaders of the Afrikander bund pro

the Cape Parliament until the Brltfab.

did not want evasive language on the

STEPHEN CRANE IS
CALLED BY DEATH
TO ABROGATE
THE CLAYTON
BULWER PACT
Favorable Report by Morgan
on a Senate Reso
lution.
Declares It to Be the Duty of Con
gress to Free This Country
From^the Provisions of
the Treaty.
Morgan made a written report travers
ing the grounds for the abrogation of the
treaty In considerable detail.
The report is practically a plea for the
House Nicaragua canal bill. In It. Sen
ator Morgan says that "if the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty stands in the way of the
purposes of our Government, it must give
way to the paramount law If the House
bill is enacted Into a statute of the United
He admits, however, that It Is a ques
tion whether it is an obstruction. The
effect of the Hay-Paunceforte negotiation
Is discussed in detail and the conclusion
is drawn that "as to all that relates to
the canal, the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, if
it is ratified, terminates and abrogates
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty."
But if the Senate should reject the Hay-
Paunceforte treaty, he said, the startling
question will be raised whether the Sen
ate, in the exercise of Its treaty-making
power, can abdicate or paralyze Its
treaty-making power.
"Can one-third of the Senate, by de
feating the Hay-Pauncefote negotiation,"
he asks, "compel a majority or the Sen
ate to abstain from enacting the House
bill because the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
would be thereby put into full effect aa
a bar to such actions?"
In conclusion, the report says that "If
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is in force and
If Great Britain so Insists, It Is the clear
duty of Congress to declare that It la
abrogated." .'...'_>
If the treaty Is abrogated the conclu
sion Is that the way is cleared for propos
ing to Nicaragua and Costa Rica such
terms as may be appropriate for acquir
ing In those States whatever rights and
powers they are at liberty to concede to
enable the United States to construct and
control the canal, and also to open the
way for such a general declaration as to
the neutrality of the canal as shall meet
the approbation of the civilized powers.
"If this resolution is rejected and the
Hay-Pauncefote treaty Is not ratified we
will be left," says the report, "to the
alternative we should now accept of de
claring that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty
cannot stand as a perpetual barrier. If
such Is the pleasure of Great Britain,
against the right of the United States to
construct a ship canal In connection with
Nicaragua to connect the -waters of the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
"The passage of the House bill now
pending should be tho first step In the
indispensable movement, and the Senate
should not permit the conclusion It may
have reached on the Hay-Pauncefote
Â¦ treaty, which is a minor consideration,
to obstruct the will of the majority of
this body in its action on the House bill."
WASHINGTON, June 4.â Senator Mor
gan, from the Committee on Interoceanic
Canals, to-day favorably reported a reso
lution for the abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty. As 'reported the resolu
tion reads:

Wounded Refugees Arrive.
LONDON, June 5.â The" Daily Mail has
thfe 'following dispatch .dated Monday,
from Shanghai: Later reports from Tien
tsin show that no British or American
missionaries were among the refugees
who escaped from the Pao Ting Fu Dis
trict. ' The safety of the seven foreigners
still missing is despaired of. Twenty
three of the French and Belgian party
arrived wounded at Tientsin after ter
rible suffering. . I
. The Peking correspondent of the Times,
telegraphing June 3, says: The Boxers
have burned Huang Tsun station, on the
Peking-Tientsin Railway. The railway
service is dislocated and the foreign
guards are necessary to police the line.
The services of a party of Cossacks were
accepted on Sunday to accompany the re
lief party from Tientsin to rescue the
mining engineers in the interior. The re
lief party returned without fulfilling its
mission. Two Russian officers have been
wounded by the Boxers and another Rus
sian detachment is sure to be sent to
punish the assailants.
The reported murders of the mission
aries appear to be fictitious, although the
fate of one British missionary is causing
anxiety. Chinese who are associated with i
foreigners or with Christianity are beinj
vigorously persecuted.
British Interests in China.
LONDON, June s.â The Times, dealing
! editorially this morning- with the Chinese
situation alludes to the Immense British.
Interests in China and the enormous dam
age to the railway and other property
that has already resulted from the action,
of the Boxers. It criticizes British di
plomacy In the past and points out the
necessity for taking the lead In strong
measures.
"We should rejoice to do so," says tho
Times, "In company with our American
kinsfolk, the only Western nation whose
Interests in the Far East are, perhaps,
quite Identical in most respects with our
own, but that, of course. Is a matter en
tirely for them to decide. In any case
we must assert our hegemony on penalty
of forfeiting it. and we must assert it
with energy and dispatch. Happily "the
naval brigade from our. fleet In Chinese
waters affords us the means needed for
this step" at the briefest possible notice."
TIENTSIN, June 4.â The Boxers are re
ported four miles off, and an attack la
expected. Everything Is ready and the
residents are confident. Thirty-five Ger

Most Alarming Reports.
PEKING. Sunday, June 3.â The' most
alarming reports are constantly arriving
from the country, especially from Pao
Ting Fu. The telegraph wires from Pe
king to Pao Ting Fu are cut and all news
comes via Tientsin. A serious crisis ex
ists at the palace. The ultra-conserva
tive party advocates not taking repressive
measures, urging the Dowager Empress
to allow the Boxers to finish the work of
driving the foreigners out of the country,
while the moderate party, led by Prince
Ching, represents ,the serious danger of
provoking a conflict with the powers. It
Is impossible to confirm or deny the re
port, but significant Indications of tho
feeling of the Government toward foreign
ers are contained In the attempt to arrest
Lin. Chinese manager of the Peking syn
dicate; Kla, chief of the Shan SI Commer
cial Bureau, and Fan, a leading banker
of Shan Si. on the ground that they were
"dangerous characters," but in reality be
cause they are connected with the new
British enterprises. Fortunately all of
them were absent and they have not yet
been arrested. The British Minister, Sir
Claude McDonald^ has addressed a note
to the Tsung LI Yamen demanding. to
know why the arrests were ordered.
Dispatch of the Cossacks.
LONDON, June 4. â According to a spe
cial dispatch from Shanghai the Cossacks
were dispatched to the rescue of the Bel
gians after a stormy interview between
the Belgian Minister, Baron deVlnck de
Deux Orp. and the members of the Tsung
U Yamen. The dispatch says also:
"Over forty miles of bridges and sta
tions on the Lu Han Railway have been
destroyed and It will take months to re
pair the damage done. The German and
Austrian guards have arrived at Peking.
It is asserted t-hat the Government is de
laying the transmission of telegrams - In
order to conceal the movements of the
Boxers. Apparently the Chinese officials
will do nothing to prevent the massacres
and otitrages unless the powers take some
concerted action.
SHANGHAI. June 4. â A number of des
peradoes, disguised as passengers, have
pirated the British Yangtse steamer

beries, terrorizing the passengers, who
were quite unable to offer resistance. The
WASHINGTON. June 4.â The fol
lowing telegram has been re
ceived at the State Department
from United States Minister
Conger at Peking:
"PEKING. June 4.â Outside of Peking
the murders and persecutions by the
'Boxers' seem to be on the increase. The
Pao Ting Fu Railway Is temporarily
abandoned. Work on the Peking and
Hangkow line Is stopped. All foreigners
have fled. The Chinese Government seems
either unwilling .or unable to suppress
the trouble. The troops show no energy
in attacking the 'Boxers.' CONGER."
Grave as these advices are, they have
not Induced the State Department to vary
the line of action it has laid down. The
naval force of the United States near Pe
king, represented by one vessel, the New
ark, has not been strengthend, but. If oc
casion should arise. Admiral Kempn*
might be reinforced to almost any extent
likely to be needed in the course of three
or four days from the American fleet still
at Manila and vicinity.
An Example to the Powers.
Owing to the peculiar character of the
Chinese coast naval vessels of formidable
type are unable to approach the populous
provinces of China, and especially are the
"Boxer" afflicted communities inacces
sible to naval vessels. The fc^ate Depart
ment does not contemplate the use of
United States troops, and It would be dif
ficult to spare any of the force now opera
ting in the Philippines, even if it were
found expedient to employ the military
arm. So, for the time being at least, the
small marine contingents at Peking and
Tientsin must represent the defensive
power of the United States, for it Is dis
tinctly stated that these marines are em
ployed simply In the protection of the
United States Legation and consulates
and for the assistance of such American
citizens as may be In jeopardy.
It is possible that the State Department.

Senator Fairbanks Prevents Its Re

Time.
WASHINGTON. June 4.â The Senate
was in executive session for three hours
to-day, dividing its time between an ex
tradition treaty, which has been negoti
ated recently with the republic of Switzer
land, and the nomination of Hon. W. D.
Hynurn. to be General Appraiser of Mer
chandise at New York. The treaty was
ratiiied without division after (some slight

agreement on the subject of extradition of
criminals tmd is a mere modification of
the old treaty with Switzerland. Accord
ing to the former agreement Switzerland
was pledged to the surrender of her own
citizens upon demand of the United
States, but a law having been enacted
recently by the legislative assembly of
thai country making it unlawful to make
?uch surrcniWr, a new treaty became nec
essarjr to conform to the new conditions
and accordingly the treaty ratified to-day
was negotiated.
When the treaty was disposed of the
Bycum nomination waÂ» taken up and its
consideration pushed by Senators who
opjiosed confirmation on the theory that
if. a vote could be secured confirmation
would be defeated. Senator Fairbanks,
as i!r. BynunVs irlend and chifcf sup
porter, opposed consideration and failing
in his purpose moved to recommit the
nomination to the Committee on Finance.
This motion was lost by a vote of Zl to
C4. Fairbanks then, at 4 o'clock, took the
"nor and s^poke for the remaining two
hour? of the executive session. The
closed session vr&s brought to an end a
few minutes before K o'clock by an order
for a root;'? at that hour and action upon
the nomination to-day was prevented.

Its expiration apparently is to be quite

the speech on the Philippine question by

sideration of the anti-trust bill passed by
the House last Saturday.
To-night u. picturesque session was held
â a sort of social session, at which

vrltb a gayly attired crowd of spectators.
Pettigrcw replied at length to the speech
of Spooner of Wisconsin on the Pniiip

The remainder of the session was con

the matter came up, and, owing to the

MING THE
ADJOURNMENT
OF CONGRESS
HAVANA, June 4 â Acting Director of
Posts Brlstow to-day inquired as to the
amount of postal funds taken by C. F.
W. Neely in May, 1899, and ascertained
that it was $31,312 95. Neely's monthly
average was about $17,000. His system of
bookkeeping was simplicity itself. Ap
parently he merely divided the amounts
received, taking one-half for himself and
accounting for the other half. â¢
This morning the examination of Estes
G. Rathbone, former director of posts.
was continued. It lasted more than four
hours. The most startling fact developed
was that on May 26 of last year Mr. Rath*
bone ordered Special Agents Leatherer
and Sullivan to' examine the accounts.
They found a shortage, but it was not
thought that anything had gone wrong.
They reported, however, that there was
no check upon the Bureau of Finance and
they recommended that certain blank
forms be made, which would answer the
purpose, such as all Postmasters use when
making their reports *tt> the department
monthly. Mr. Maynard, then chief agent,
indorsed the recommendation and for
warded it to Mr. R'athbone. The latter
approved it and sent it to Auditor Reeves,
who initialed it and forwarded it to
Neely. After he had initialed it, instead
of putting the scheme into operation, he
quietly pigeonholed it and it did not see
the light until May 15 of this year, when
the plan was put into effect.
\ir. Brlstow says he is almost sure
that the extent of the steal will amount
to something between $$0,000 and $100,000,
but that this will not touch the item of
surcharge stamps, which is $411,000. As
to how many of these were burned and
bow many sold it is impossible to obtain
definite information. As many have been
traced, it is known positively that all
were not destroyed, but if Neely sold, say
fifty or a houndred thousand dollars'
worth, it would not be surprising, Mr.
Bristow â¢thinks, to ftnd them scattered
all over the world. The postal inspectors
say it is astonishing that -a system so
rotten could have been concealed beyond
the first month. Every day only adds to
the surprises.
Hopes are expressed by some of the
local papers that, as Governor Roosevelt
has signed the extradition order, no fur
ther time will be wasted in bringing
Neely to trial. The Cubano says:
"Cuba is not primarily interested, but
she looks to see what the United States
will â¢ do. Fraud is not the monopoly of
any nation; and there is great difference
between the frauds of the Postofflce and
those committed under the Spanish re
gime. Now thorough investigation is be
ing made with a view of punishing the
criminals. In former days the criminals
went scot free. Tbe Americans are prov
ing themselves more honest than the
Government which ruled Cuba for four
hundred years."
GOVERNOR ROOSEVELT
ON NEELY'S THEFTS
ALBANY, Nv Y., June 4.â Governor
Roosevelt to-night made public his rea
sons for granting the application for the
extradition of C. F. W. Neely, implicated
in the Cuban postal frauds. He said?
"I went over the briefs BUbmttted to
me by both sides carefully, and also con
sulted very carefully with the Attorney
General in the matter. While admitting
that an argument could be made on both
sides, it seemed perfectly clear to me
that In both law and morals it was my
duty to grant the, extradition of Mr.
Neely. I was glad that the decisions be
fore me warranted this action, because I
feel that the reasons for granting an ex
tradition In the case of another State ap
ply with tenfold greater force In the
case of Cuba, where the United States is
bound by every consideration to see that
its officials give It an administration that
shall be literally stainless in point of. in
tegrity." Â¦-

The police and Sheriff Langford were
soon on the scene, but could obtain no
definite description of the man. John
Kelly, a laborer on a ranch near Almaden,
was "arrested on suspicion, and later Sher
iff Langford arrested Jim Moreland near
Lawrence station. They were subsequent
ly released. The' Sheriff finally obtained
a description of the man from Woods ana
he and Bache ran down their man in the
Reception saloon. When arrested by Dep
uty Sheriff Bache he confessed he had
killed Narvaez.
Winship was placed in prison, but he
refuses to make any further statement.
No weapon was found on him, the gun
having evidently been- hidden.
Frank Narvaez, the dead man. was 36
years old and had always lived in this
community. .He drank a great deal, but
was of a peaceable nature. He md Win
ship had been drinking together last
night. Winshlp's reputation has not been
of the best. A year ago he 'was arrestea
on suspicion of having committed a burg
lary, and it is said he had been in cus
tody at Fresno for horse stealing, but
was acquitted. A few months ago he was
arrested and fined for carrying a con
cealed weapon. He is about 40 years old
and has an aged mother residing here.
Just what led to the shooting is un
known. Both men entered the restaurant
together and ordered a meal. They en
gaged in a wrangle during the eating, al
though little attention was paid to them.
The next thing noticed was that Win
ship had a revolver in his hand and was
holding Narvaez by the shoulder, trying
to shoot him in the head. Narvaez pushed
the weapon aeLde several times, but Win
ship finally placed the pistol against his
victim's neck and fired. The bullet, a 38
caliber, entered the neck below the left
ear and pierced the jugular vein. It
ranged downward and lodged between the
seventh and eighth ribs. After staggering
a few feet, Xarvaez fell over dead. No
weapon was found on the dead man,
Winship rushed from the place, leaving
25 cents on the counter to pay for his
meal. The waiters and others in the res
taurant were so excited they made no at
tempt to stop Winship and could give no
description of him.
Ed Woods, a bartender, left the restau
rant by a side entrance and started down
Fountain street. Winship started in the
same direction and at tha corner of Sec
ond street crossed over and accosted
Woods. Still holding the revolver In his
hand, he said, "You are with me, aren't
you, partner?" Woods replied In the af
firmative, and Winship went on down Sec

MURDERER OF
FRANK NARVAEZ
HAS CONFESSED
He still insisted that she should keep
off the stage. Mrs. Potter replied that
she loved her art better than life and
would not give It up. She said that these
were the days of a dark age when women
were slaves. In correspondence with Mr.
-Potter she said that his family was noth
ing to herâ she hated the very name of
his people and that Mr. Potter's uncle
Henry (meaning Bishop Potter) was all
fuss and feathers, name and family pride.
Their daughter- remained with her
mother until the latter came to America,
when Mr. Potter took her to Tuxedo.
Mrs. Potter visitetl there to see her
daughter, but was received only as a
guest, not as mistress of the house. Again
she saw the daughter on the streets m
New York some years later and would
not have known her had 'it not been for
a nurse who had been in the family since
the birth of the child. During the ab
sence from the family Mrs. Potter's let
ters averaged one in two years.
Then followed correspondence by cable,
in which Mrs. Potter said she had set her
heart on her art and would not comply,
telling her husband that her name would
be beloved from the Atlantic to the Pa
cific and he would be proud of her.
In his deposition James Brown Potter
testified that he was married to Mary
L'rquhart in New Orleans in 1877. They
went to Xew York to live, where a daugh
ter was born In 1&79. They lived together
happily, apparently, until 18S6, when Mrs.
Potter, her daughter, mother and sister
went abroad merely for the summer. Be
fore going Mrs. Potter spoke to her hus
band several times about adopting the
stage professionally, but was refused.
When abroad the subject was renewed by
correspondence. Mrs. Potter urging her
husband to consent, without success.
Then Mr. Potter saw a cable announce
ment that Mrs. Potter had -signed with
the Haymarket- Theater, London." He im
mediately cabled to her demanding that

About Nine Hundred Deputies, Comprising
a Posse Comitatus and Armed
With Shotguns, on Duty.
ST. LOUIS, June 4.â Every power-house
end carsned of the Transit Company Is
being guarded to-night by Sheriff Pohl
mann's posse comitatus. In all about 900
men are on duty. A force of from fifty to
sixty men has been stationed at each

throughout the night. At 7 o'clock to
morrow morning an equal number of men
will relieve those on duty to-night and re

bers of the Sheriff's posse will be subject
to strict military discipline. Those not on
guard will be held in reserve at the differ

to-day to his commanders of detachments,
in part as follows:
You will take" care of your men, maintain
good discipline and place under arrest any one
under your command who commits a serious
breach of discipline.
Your men will pay no attention to trifling
annoyances from citizens, but will submit to
no abuse, promptly arresting any offender.
In quellinc any riot or disturbance, and In
dispersing any unlawful and threatenine as
semblage of persons, you will use your ut
most endeavor to arrest the ringleaders and
instigators, turning them over to the police
for incarceration. You will use only the nec
essary force In the performance of such duty,
but will meet violence with violence: and if
fired upon you are expected, with due regard
for the safety of innocent bystanders, to make
sure that the criminals reach the Jail, or the
morsue. If necessary. â¢

In an order to the police force he says:
"Too many defenseless women have
been beaten and stripped of their clothing

TEXAN FEUDISTS
DIE FIGHTING IN
A COURTROOM
The institution with which the defend
ants are connected is also known as the
Independent Medical College and the Na
tional Law School, and the evidence
shows that its faculty has been selling
degrees for the practice of medicine and
law at prices ranging from $3 to $200, the
compensation being determined by the
amount the would-be professional -men
were willing to advance. Postofflce In
spector Gould, who made the arrest, says
the fraud is one of the largest the postal
authorities have ever had to deal with
and that the graduates of the institution
are practicing in every State and even
abroad. He says frequent complaints of
malpractice have been made against the
holders of the diplomas of the institution.
Regular medical colleges and law insti
tutions in all parts of the United States
have been fighting the officers of the "di
ploma mill" for several years in vain and
up to the time the men were arrested it
is said they were "graduating their./sub
scribers at the rate of a dozen each day."
The complaint on which the warrants
were, issued was sworn to by Joseph De
barthe of Baker City, Or., who was form
erly connected with the institution as an
agent for selling diplomas and is listed on
the college prospectus as "professor of
medical jurisprudence." He says he paid
$23 for a degree issued by the Independent
Medical College on August 30, 189S, and
thought his authority to practice medicine
was valid until he was refused certificates
in several States. He says he never al
lowed his name to appear on the faculty
list though he occasionally transacted the
law business of the institution.
Inspector Gould induced a friend to
write to the Metropolitan Medical College
for Information. The institution offered
to give a full course in medicine and a
degree for $200 and shorter terms of study
for smaller amounts.
Inspector Gould has a bunch of unsigned
certiticates of practice for the State of
Texas and he says the name of the Dis
trict Clerk is forged to these for an extra
compensation. Texas is said to have been
the most fertile field for the "graduates"
of the Institution. The British Consul has
made repeated efforts to run the Metro
politan faculty out of business as Great
Britain is said to have been Hooded with
their diplomas. ; It is said that dozens of
"graduates" of Dr. Armstrong's institu
tion are practicing in India and in all
parts of the world. The diplomas bear the
names of the whole faculty, but two girls
declared they were employed to write
these on all degrees issued by the col
lege.

FILIPINO LOSSES IN
KILLED AND WOUNDED
Discussing the Spooner bill now pend
ing. Pettigrew quoted a dispatch from
Manila, published to-day. Faying that
Judge Taft. head of the Philippine com
mission, had expressed upon his arrival
at Manila a surprise that the Filipinos
had not heard of the Spooner bill,
"by which," Pettigrew said, "Mr. Taft
was to become the civil governor of the
Philippinesâ the despot of the island."
Th<Â» reason they had not heard of It,
P^ttigrew added, was that the adminis
tration had changed its mind and Siiere
was now no intention of passing the bill.
Pettigrew will conclude his speech to
morrow.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â During the
evening session of the Senate Pettlgrew
<Pop.) of South Dakota took the floor
on the Philippine question. He sharply
criticised the administration for not giv
ing Congress and the people full informa
tion concerning affairs in the Philippines,
and said that most of the information
received had come through a "censored
press" and private letters. Speaking of
some of the information furnished by
Spooner (R.) of Wisconsin to the Sen
ate, he said it was supplied only to "ad
ministration Senators ' and "was not
available to those of us opposed to the
administration's imperialistic policy."
At great length Pettigrew argued that
the Filipinos were allies of the United
States. He said he had no desire to Im
peach the veracity of Admiral Dewey, but
since the admiral had denounced as false
his <PettJgrew J s| statement that the ad
miral had recognized the Filipinos as al
lies and had saluted their flag, he (Pet
tigrew) felt it incumbent upon him to
present the facts and let the American
people Judge as to the admiral's veracity.
He presented a mass of matter in sup
port of his contention, but nothing new
except a letter from the executive officer
of the Olympia. Admiral Dewey's flag

PETTIGREW ASSAILS
PHILIPPINE POLICY
General Corbin says it is Incorrect to
state that the time of the volunteer army
is to be extended or that reinforcements
are to be sent to the Philippines, the
being simply that the volunteers are to
itf brrught home for disbandment and
enough regulars sent there to take their
places to give General MacArthur 40.000
men to assist in maintaining the suprem
acy of the United States and to carry
out the plans of civil government deter
mined upon by the Taft Commission.
General Corbin says it is proposed to
maintain an army of 40.OU0 regulars in the
Philippines so long as it is required, and
to do this it will be necessary to draw
upon the troops now in Cuba. "The army
in the Philippines at present numbers
about C2.<>XÂ» men. equally divided be
tween regulars and volunteers. All the
â¢volunteers are to be brought home and
mustered out at the place of enlistment
c:i June 30 of next year, and in order to
accomplish this with certainty and with
the least embarrassment, the homeward
movement will begin early in the coming
November. As was the case with the vol
unieeis for the Spanish war, they will be
brought home fo far as possible in the
order of thtn departure from the United
States. To do this will tax the transport
service to its utmost, and a good margin
of time will be allowed to guard against
unforeseen and unavoidable delays. The
plan is to have all the men at their homes
and their accounts with the Government
closed on the last day of their term of
enlistment. This is a task of enormous
proportions, and will tax the powers of
the entire military establishment to the
utmost frcm now until it is fully acorn-
X-lished.
In order that thrre may be no immedi
ate reduction of the force under General
SfacArthtrr. it has been arranged to send
regular troops to the Philippines as rap-
Idly as possible to take the places of the
departing volunteers. Oruers have been
iÂ«> ut-u lor the assembling of the Sixth
Cavalry at San Francisco for transport
to Mar.lla. One detachment of that regi-
TrH'iit will leave about the 15th inst. and
another about the 1st of July. It is be-
Ucved that many of the troops in Cuba
can be relieved from duty in that coun
try soon after the elections there, on the
JT.th inst. In case the conditions justify
it. tht-sc troops will be brought home and
assigned to home stations, in order that
the home garrisons may be utilized m re
cruiting the army in the Philippines.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â In order to
prevent misapprehension as to the future
policy of the War Department respecting
the military forces in the Philippines. 3d
jutant General Corbin made a brief state
ment of the facts In the case to-day. He
said there had been no change of policy
flnce the departure of General Otis and
that none was contemplated. Under the
Taw the entire volunteer army now serv
ing in the Philippines will go out of ex
istence on June 30. 1901. and the problem
before the War Department is now ..o get
the 31.000 men of that army home from
the Philippines before the date named, at
the same time relieving: them with otfier
troop3 of the regular establishment so
lar as possible, without loss of military
prestige in the Philippines and without
material disturbance of the military or
ganization.

Orchardists Alarmed Over Approach.
of the Orange Maggot From
Central America.
The orange orchardists of this State arc
alarmed over the approach of a parasite,
known as the Mexican orange maggot.
The pest made its appearance near tho
Panama Isthmus and has been rapidly
working Its way north through Central
America, attacking and destroying or
chards and fruit until now it is within
a few hundred miles of the boundary be
tween this country and Mexico. Horti
cultural Quarantine Ofllcer Alex Craw
called the attention of the commission to
the pest and advised that radical meas
ures be taken to prevent- its entering the
State. As it is the same color as the
fruit it is very hard to detect and he
states that there is great danger from
the millions of Mexican oranges that are
soon to appear on the California market,
unless something is done.
Orange orchardists in the southern
part of the State are so greatly alarmed
that they have communicated with par
ties all over the State urging that the
Western representatives at Washington
be asked to hasten at an early date the
passage of the national horticultural
quarantine bill, governing the importa
tion of fruit trees and plants from for
eign countries and between States. Upon
the request of the I>os Angeles Chamber
of Commerce the local chamber yester
day sent a dispatch to Senator Perkins,
urging him to interest his co-representa
tives in the passage of the bill.

Joe Hart is the reigning spirit on the
Orpheum programme of this week. He
holds the stage with Carrie de Mar in a
snappy musical skit, "A Close Call," and
jives further evidence of talent, in his
latest sketch. "An Eventful l>ay." ex
ploited by Fleurette and Gardner. Fleu

California.
The troubles of that rag infant filled the
California to the "stanaing-room-only"
notch last night and the explosive turns
kept the audience on a laugh from the
rising of the curtain to the settling there
of. The necklace of sparkling specialty
diamonds ran off better last night than
at the opening because the performers
had got the ends properly together the
night before. This effervescent combina
tion has made a hit of high gear and
nothing will be able to shove it off the
track during its run in San Francisco.
The players are all clever and have good
material in their bands. Guffaws will em
anate from pleased auditors every Â¦ re
maining night that Dunne and Ityley and
their assortment of scintillating funmak
crs remain.
"Sapho," at the Alcazar, attracted an
unusually larjre crowd to the popular lit
tle theater. It is the first performance of
the play given in this city, and Florence
Koberts has been engaged for the title
role. The first scene opens with a masked
t all In Dechelette's studio, and the h!gh
ifil praise must be given to the action and
costuming of the maskers. Each actor
seemed "acquainted" with his neighbor
and to be interested in something nearer
home than tho audience, a triumph most
rarely achieved by the average performer.
The dance of Miss Gertrude Hayes in this
act was charmingly graceful, and Miss
Georple Woodthorpe's specialty was en
joyed.
Of Sapho herself. Sapho has come to
town and apparently come to stay, judg
ing by the warmth of welcome accorded
her clever interpreter. Florence Roberts.
Sapho (but why the one-lfgged spelling?)
as Miss Roberts sees her is a true, subtle
and convincing conception. This actress'
art is a finished art. of fine restraint and
exceptional emotional power, and one is
not called upon to exercise an overworked
imagination wht-n the heroine's charms
are enlarged upon; another grateful
change.
Ernest Hastings appears â¢ to be quite
as popular as Miss Roberts and admirably
sustained the emotional dtmands of the
part of Gaussin. He sotms. however,
rather to overemphasize the brutal and
boorish in this most unheroic hero's char
acter. A rather finer drawingârestraint
is needed.
George P. â¢ Webster was an admira
ble Uncle Caesaire. Dechelette and Fla

Miss Laura Crews was a charming Irene
and the remainder of the large cast filled
acceptably their several parts.
Miss Roberts and Mr. Hastings received
ten furtain recalls after the first act, and
on Miss Roberts declaring that she "real
ly had not a thing to say but 'thank
you." " I^'wis Morrison made a neat little

the audience for their appreciation of

U DU PONT SYLE
oT is seldom that a play worth seeing:
| twice visits San Francisco. "When 4
\ We Were Twenty-one" is worth seeing
" more than twice: it interested me more
the iserond time than the first, and I be
lieve it would interest me more the third
time than the second. Both Mr. Goodwin
and Iflsa Elliott have Improved upon their
performance of the first night: the former
is more convincing in the serious scenes.
the latter is more ea*=y in the lighter ones.
It i? impossible to say that Miss Elliott
has yet mastered the extremely difficult
situation In the second act â the most dif
fjcalt in the playâ whÂ»re she discovers
that it is Richard Andaine and not Rich
ard Carew who is faithless and unworthy.
The transition from the sense of injury
and despair to one of supreme rapture has
all to be expressed in a few broken ex
clamations. The author has here required
the actress to perform a task that mieht
â¢well tax the powers of a Terry or a Re
han. It is no discourtesy to Miss Elliott
to say she has not yet attained the con
summate skill of those artists.
Some people think that Mr. Woodruff
overdoes the part of the Imp. It seems
to me he gives it juM the right touch.
Richard Andaine must be represented as
hot-headed and impulsive, or it would be
impossible for him to commit thx? action
around which the whole play turns. Mr.
Woodruffs intelligence and feeling show
in every line. Mark him, I pray you: he is
a coming man. Messrs. O'Brien, Gillmore
and Handyfide play the trinity with en
tire effectiveness, and Miss Haskins, as
Kara Glynesk, could not be improved
upon.
Ttye stape management (Mr. Presbrey) is
well niph perfect, and the setting more
than sufficient. The theater can never
lose its hold on thinking people so long as
it can present such a play, with such a
cast as this. Come back. Mr. Goodwin,
next year and give us something as good â
and that will have to be very good indeed.

Fischer's Concert-house was packed by
an appreciative audience last night. Tht
duet from "Mignon." sung by Signorina
Pollettini and Siynor Abramoff. was ap
plauded to the echo and the sextet from
"Lucia" raised the curtain three times.
Miss Martini sang- Tyrolean songs and
was rewarded with five recalls. Lina
Lucas, a clever soubrette, also made a hit.
To-night the Nile scene from "Aida" will
be staged in a most elaborate way.

Four Dollars to Wink and Six Dollars
for a Drinkâ French Typewrit
ers as Agents of Civili
zation.
If the impressions of W. W. Foote, one
of California's Commissioners to the Paris
Exposition, be true, the French capital,
in holiday attire and with all the myriad
attractions of an exposition city, is not
what the American imagination has con
ceived it to be. Since the well-known
Californian left on his long journey he has
written to various friends in this city and,
half In earnest and half in jest, he says
that he is supremely disgusted that a pil
grim so far from home .should be left
without a word from those he left be
hind.
In the same mood he discusses Paris as
he found it. "Paris is just what I ex
pected it to be," he writes, "and, of
course, you perfectly understand what
that means." One might suspect that
Mr. Foote was entranced by the city, but
his next impression removes the suspicion.
"If I had my own way about it," he says,
"I would start for Oakland to-morrow
morning, because this place is a little too
high for my blood. 1 have a very nice
apartment, horses, carriages, etc., but I
would rather be in San .tiancisco a day
than to stay in Paris a ytar. Don't you
come to Paris under any circumstances
unless you are prepared to mortgage the
Hamburg-Bremen. It costs you $4 to wink
your eye and $6 for a drink. With your
capacities you could easily spend $1UW a
day and bt!" economical.
"When I go out alone. I invariably get
lost I can't tell a haekman where I want
to go or what my name Is, and I am in
permanent danger of being put in a luna
tic asylum. If you were to hear that i
am in* such a place put it down as abso
lutely true."
In passing Mr. Foote warns several oÂ£
his fsiends to destroy any thought they
may have of going to Paris. Knowing
them as he does he counsels them that
their needs will make their return from
their journey bankrupts. In conclusion
he asks indulgence for any mistakes, as
the letter was written by a French type
writer in whom, with a lack of gallantry
not usual in him, he appears to have no
more confidence than in anything else
French he has seen.
In seeking to fulfill the obligations
which as an officer he is under, Mr. Foote
assures a prominent jurist of the State
that with his capacities and the drains
upon his purse he could not live in Paris
at all A leading aspirant for the posi
tion of naval officer, Mr. Foote says,
might last a week, but an ex-Park Com
missioner, whose face is familiar to thou
sands in San Francisco, would be in jail
iifteen minutes after he reached Paris.
Mr. Foote admits that these are harsn
criticisms, but he pleads for them on the
score that he must perform his whole
duty to the people of the State.
In a letter to another friend the well
known Californian Is still overpowered
at the irresponsibility of the malls and at
the Californian faculty of being supreme
ly unconcerned In answering the letters
of friends. "If this letter from me
doesn't meet with better success than
those from San Francisco," writes Mr.
Foote, "then I have no idea that this will
ever reach you." He then gives his im
pressions, such as t^ey have been in the
limited time at his command, and assures
his friend that California Is not only mak
ing a creditable showing, but Is receiving
praise for it. "Here the best is done for
California," he writes, "and we are mak
ing a very creditable showing."
in conclusion he tells that he has
learned of his elevation to the high dig
nity of appointment on the Governor s
staff as lieutenant colonel. "With some
thing of a prophetic eye and an apprecia
tion of what others would think â¢ he
writes: "I have just received a dispatch
that I havÂ« been appointed lieutenant
colonel. Wait till you see me in uniform
in the streets of Paris. Nit!" Honors
evidently weigh lightly upon the distant
Californian.

Submits Resolution to Supervisors
for Purpose of Reducing Mu
nicipal Expenses.
Supervisor Reed presented a resolution
to the Board of Supervisors just before
the meeting adjourned last night which
is Intended to reduce the expenses of the
municipal government In order to provide
a fund for public Improvements. The
resolution follows:
Whereas. It appears from the tax budget that
sufficient money to make the plans and esti
mates of the cost of acquiring public utilities,
commanded to be made within one year in ar
ticle 12 of the. new charter, cannot be levied;
and
Whereas, It also arrears that little or no
money can be devoted to public improvements,
notwithstanding the new charter was believed
by the people to be an instrument which would
bring about a new era of progressive public
improvements, and notwithstanding the plat
form upon which a majority of the Supervisors
was elected, pledees "the Mayor and Super
visors to a liberal policy of public improve
ments"; and
Whereas, It appears that the multiplication
of high-salaried officials is responsible in a
large measure. If not wholly, for the costly ad
ministration under the new charter; now there-
Resolved, That a committee of three be ap
pointed by the president to draft amendments
to the new charter for the purpose of reducing
the expenses of administration;, and to that
end the committee is directed to make a maxi
mum limit beyond which salaries cannot be
raised and a maximum limit beyond â¢which the
number of rlaces cannot be increased; and they
are further directed to provide a particular
fund to be designated "the public improvement
fund." which shall be devoted exclusively In
the making of public improvements, as distin
guished from the payment of salaries, and
which said fund shall not be less than five
hundred thousand (J500.00C) dollars per annum.

Special Dlypatch to -The Call.
I STANFORD UNIVERSITY, June 4.â
Two important announcements have been
'.made by the Stanford authorities relative
; to changes that will be instituted the next
I college year. The law department ia to
be developed along rather radical lines
when compared to the system In vogue
in other American schools, and it has been
determined that not more than 500 female
students may matriculate during any one
| term hereafter. A definite plan of select
j ing candidates has yet to be arranged.
i It is probable that women students with
! advanced standing will be favored.
This curtailing condition regarding the
[ fair sex Is based upon the fixed Idea of the
i founders, settled upon long before the uni
i versity began its active existence â that
I the institution should be a school of gen
: eral training for men In the arts that
! would make them useful in life. It is
said that Mrs. Stanford favored, during
' the original planning, an equal co-educa
j tional scheme, whereby men and women
1 would stand alike in privilege and favor.
Senator Stanford at first deemed higher
j education, broadly speaking, only neces
! sary for men. Under a sort of compro
â¢ mise the maximum number of women
â¢ was placed at WX). Applications already in
; for the opening of the next college term
'â¢ in September indicate that there will be
; fifteen hundred students in attendance.
i With the completion of the new library
i the main northeastern section of the
j quadrangie became the law building. Dur-
I Ing the next three months a great num
j ber of new books will be here shelved and
i catalogued. An acquisition heretofore
Â¦ unannounced will be in place shortly. It
is nothing less than the splendid private
i library of the late United States Supreme
I Court Justice Stephen J. Field. It comes
as a gift from the widow of the eminent
I jurist. Besides containing an especially
i strong Federal series, both of the upper
and lower court?, there are the State re
ports of Massachusetts. New York and
Ohio and hundreds of valuable text books.
Under other recent additions the law de
partment is on a strongly equipped work
ing basis.
The outlined scheme of study differs ma
terially from that of Eastern institutions.
Beginning with this year Stanford will
j require every graduate of the law school
to have previously acquired an A. B. de
gree or its equivalent. The undergraduate
who elects law: at Stanford may take only
the equal of one year in the law school
during his four collegiate years. Then
there fellow two years of law work lead-
Ing to the degree in law. Commencing
with September, the legal faculty will set
forth Its full strength in professors and
lecturers selected during the past few
vears. At the head of the school is Na
than Abbott. LL. B.. professor of law;
I Clarke B. Whittier. LL. B.. associate pro
! lessor of law; James P. Hall, LL. B.. as
sociate professor of law; Jackson E. Rey
nolds LL. B., assistant professor of law;
Charles R. Lewors. A. B.. assistant pro
fes=<Â«or of law. Hon. Curtis H. Lindley
will lecture on the law of mines and lrri
c^tion and Joseph Hutchinson will lecture
on California practice. The courses in
Roman and International law will be con
ducted respectively, by Professors Henry
B. Fai'rclough and C. A. Dunlway.
Faculty Announces Definitely That
Ecraaftcr Not Hore Than Five
Hundred Women Will Be Ad

SPLENDID LAW
LIBRARY GIVEN
TO STANFORD
Whether or not the Treasurer may re
tain fees for the collection of the inherit
ance tax and the Assessor may retain
them for the collection of poll tax
is a matter which the charter leaves in
some doubt, and the Grand Jury has de
cided to do something toward clearing the
doubt.
Under the charter these two officials are
given a salary, and it is expressly stated
that they shall receive no more compen
sation. But the State law says they shall
receive certain percentages, the one for'
the collection of the inheritance tax and
the other for the collection of poll tax,
and the question Is, does the State law or
the charter rule?
In the meantime there is on*hand $13,000
commissions on the collection of poll tax
and nearly $3000 commissions on inherit
ance tax. The "Assessor and the Treas
urer declare the amounts belong to them:
the Auditor is of the opinion that those
two sums belong to the city, and the
Grand Jury is going to try to find out. N.
N. Regensberger, chairman of the City
Hall Committee of the Grand Jury, was
in consultation with the Auditor yester
day and the result will be seen at an early
meeting of the jury.
The provisions of the charter are that
"the salaries provided in this charter shall
be in full compensation for all services
rendered," and "It shall be the duty of
any officer authorized by law to charge,
receive or collect any fee, * * * to de
liver the same to the Treasurer at the ex
piration of each business day. â¢ â¢ â¢
The Treasurer shall place all such moneys
in a fund to be designated the 'Unappor
tioned Fee Fund." which is hereby cre
ated, and shall keep such fund as other
funds In the treasury are kept, and shall
be liable on his official bond for all money
received."
This ia plain enoujrh so far as its local
application go^s. but it is claimed that
the fees so collected are liable by the
State law for the percentage that is al
lowed the collector, for the constitution
says that the charter is supreme only in
affairs municipal, and it cannot run con
trary to any general law. The commis
sions on poll and Inheritance taxes are al
lowed by a general law.
The point is another of those which go
to limit the scope of the charter and to
define exactly what the limits of affairs
municipal are. It will probably be set
tled in a suit for mandamus to compel
the Treasurer to apportion these fees to
the various funds at the end of the fiscal
year. -

WRESTLER WILEY
WANTS LAURELS
Eastern Athlete After the
Bays He Lost at the
Olympic Club.
J* r$ AX WILEY, the clever Eastern
//)l\ wrestIer - whose brilliant work in
il 1&>\ the tournament held at the Olym
pic Cub In March last .created
such a favorable impression. Is expected
to arrive in this city to-day. He comes
at the special invitation of the local ath
letic institution to wrestle F. B. Bayly,
the only Olympian who gained a decision
over him during the tournament. The
bout will be held in the club's gymnasium
to-morrow night and will be witnessed by
members only. Wiley is every inch an
athlete and is never out of training. De
spite his long railroad journey he will be
ready to enter the gymnasium immediate
ly upon his arrival and do credit to him
self. Bayly has prepared for his coming,
and when these two clever exponents of
mat work lock arms the members will
surely see an excltine combat.
Wiley weighs 135 pounds, while Bayly,
his opponent, tips the scales at 156 pounds.
What the Easterner lacks In weight and
inches he easily makes up In science and
ag-{n"essiveness. He feels certain,, that lie
can defeat Bayly. When they met on the
last night cf the tournament Wiley was
not at his best. He had wrestled hard
on the preceding nights and was prac
tically fagged out. Despite this he made
things lively for Bayly. The last named
had the little Easterner in jeopardy twice
in the first bout, and In the other two
bouts honors were evÂ«n. '
Wiley is the champion amateur wrestler
of America in the 135 and 145 pound
classes. He was ambitious to win laurels
in the 156-pound class, but Bayly proved
not onlv too strong but too aggressive for
him. lie is so confident that he can defeat
his old opponent that he wrote to the Club
directors to arrange another bout. He
asks that the contest be settled in one
fall and that no time limit be set on the
bout. His wishes will be respected in the
matter.
Though. Complaint Has Been Made
to Health Board It Is Not

tas-eaticg deputies to visit a private cre

Mountain. This place" Is situated west
rf Masonic avenue, and between Turk
and Rose streets, where there is a collec
tion of Italian vegetable gardens. To
â¢ se *rar<1Â»-nÂ« several scavengers haul
ci':.>ads of manure and also refuse from
:'â¢ Vjusiness portions of the city, which,
urcer the ordinance, should be hauled to

tt.. Â«ravÂ« gcrs avail themselves of the
opportunity of depositing the refuse- at
the t.ardfrs, and when night sets in it is
:;-.< irerated. The j-moke and obnoxious
gases arising from it have become a r.ui-
EBBCC to the people residing in that por
tion of the citr.
Complaint after complaint has been
made to the bubonic Board of Health
alnut the matter, but without bringing
any relief to the residents, though many
. blldrea have been made ill from the ef

THE WORK OF THE SESSION.
WHILE Congress has not at this session
achieved all the public hoped for, it has done
enough to merit the commendation of the pco
j pie and to justify Republican conventions in "poini
| ing with pride" to its record as an evidence of the
; fidelity with which the representatives of the party
I carry out when in office the pledges made in the plat
r fcrms. Washington authorities state that this session
: of Congress has been the busiest in many years, and
, although it has failed to pass the Nicaragua canal bill,
i the merchant marine bill, or to revise the war revenue
' ti-.x, it haÂ» nevertheless enacted such an amount of
! beneficial legislation as to make. the record of the scs
i sion stand well in comparison with that of the most
I energetic Congress.
, The most important act of the session is of course
| the passage of the currency and banking bill, which
(has gone far toward settling all the financial problems
.of the country. In fact, the bill would have com
| pletely settled such problems were it not that the
I prominence of Bryan as the Presidential candidate of
: one of the great parties of the people continues to
! menace the sound money policy of the Government
i and compels further attention to financial issues.
One of the best features of the bili is that which
provides for an increase of small banks, so that even
in the smaller towns and villages o,f the country the
' people may have the advantage of banking facilities.
I The results of this feature of the act have thus far
â¢ been excellent. The report of the Comptroller of the
i Currency recently published gives the figures of the
} total applications for new bank charters during the
j first two months of the existence of the law. It ap
; pears that in all there h&ve been 228 of these for banks
with a capital of less than $50,000 each, making the
j total capital $5,905,000. Within the same time there
I were received applications for sixty banks with a capi
! tal of more than $50,000 each, bringing the total of
j capital up to $7,205,000.
; While the figures do not show as large an incerase
in banking facilities as was expected, they are never
: thcless an evidence of the beneficial effect of the bill.
Since so much in the way of additions to the banks
of the country has been attained within the first two
; months of the opcraijpn of the law, during the spring
i season of a Presidential election year, when capitalists
are timid about undertaking new enterprises, it is a
fair presumption that in due time the la\y will provide
all sections of the country with ample banks for the
' transaction of business.
; Hardlj' less important than the financial measures
I of 'the session were those dealing with Hawaii and
f Porto Rico. In legislating for the islands Congress
had to deal with new problems, and had almost noth
t ing in the way of precedent to serve as a .guide in
' solving them. To render the task of legislation more
j difficult, considerable differences of opinion existed
WAITING FOR OTHERS TO ACT.
DISPATCHES from London giving account
of the proceedings in Parliament stated a few
days ago that when James MacKenzie, Con
servative member for Cardiff, called attention to the
Indian famine and pointed out that the Indian Gov
ernment appears unable to cope with it, Lord George
Hamilton, Secretary for India, replied "that in his
opinion an appeal to the British exchequer now would
only dry up the springs of private charitable contribu
tions."
There is something very like infamy in that proposi
tion. When a rich and powerful Government de
liberately withholds help from the sufferers of a fam
ine so terrible as that which prevails over a large part
of India, with the object of forcing humane people to
undertake relief by private contributions, the action
is about as infamous as governmental action ever be
comes. Millions of the people of India are starving.
Their countrymen are poor. Their national affairs are
in the hands of British administrators. They cannot
levy taxes for themselves nor disburse the revenues
they pay into their treasury. Upon British officials
they must rely, and now the Minister of State who
is responsible for Indian affairs glibly informs Parlia
ment and the world that the imperial Government will
not ask an appropriation for the starving millions be
cause such an appropriation would "dry up the
springs of private charitable contributions."
In all parts of the United States benevolent men
and women are doinjf what they can to raise money to
buy food and supplies for the Indian sufferers. Ap
peals are made to the generous day after day, and the
responses have been prompt and liberal. Vast quan
tities of food and large sums of money have been con
tributed by the American people, and the aggregate
relief given in that way. has been great. Still it is not
equal to the need.. A population larger than that of
the United States is in want of the necessaries of life.
They are dying by thousands every day, amid all
forms of wretchedness and misery. Â¦ The utmost
powers of civilization exerted to the fullest could
hardly minister to the wants of all, the sufferers, and
in the face of that fact the Secretary for India op
poses a grant of relief from the British exchequer
because it would dry up charity.
The policy thus announced is something more than
inhumanity. It 13 a violation of a plain duty impera
tive in its. nature. So far as any Government is re
sponsible for the conditions of the people under its
control, the Government of Great Britain is respon
sible for the conditions in India. It has established
over those people an absolute paternalism, so far as
subjection and restriction are concerned, for it allows
them little or no voice in the. direction of their af
fairs, and consequently it owes them something of 2
paternal care for their welfare and their lives. Great
Britain is rich. There is no lack of money in her ex
chequer. When the Government recently asked for
a war loan the capitalists of the world offered in the
aggregate more- than ten times what was asked for.
Therefore if the British Ministry desire to relieve In
dia.-it can dp so without trouble. It prefers, however,"
to wait. It does not intend to dry up that spring of
private charity which is so abundantly flowing from
the United States.

WILL HAS BEEN FILED
Book Concern to Be Turned Over to
a Special Commission of
Methodists.
Rev. James H. N. Â¦Williams of Xapa
read a papeT at the Methodist ministers'
meeting yesterday morning on "The In
fluence of Skepticism on Character." In
part he said:
We bÂ«lleve it would be ruinous to moral
character to give up our faith la Christianity,
because of the manner in which morals are
treated by secular schools. The ten com
mandments, or moral law. are regarded by ail
Christians and Jews as of very rreat import
ance, but in the minds and teachings of mod
ern skeptics the ten commandments aa a code
of morals are considered very Inferior. I con
tend that the moral and intellectual are not
one, but distinct and Independent. Undoubt
edly skeptics would like to establish their
oneness.
The 'names of the gentlemen who will
compose the commission to look after the
interests of the Book Concern were read
at the meeting. They are: Rolla V. Watt
C. B. Perkins. I. J. Truman, Rev. J. N.
Beard and Rev. E. R. Dllle, representing
the Northern. Conference, and A. J. Wal
lace and T. C. Miller of the Southern Con
ference. The Book Concern will pass into
the hands of the commission on July 1.
The sum of $7300 a year, which is equiva
lent to the annual losses of the Book Con
cern for the past three years, will be al
lowed the commission as a margin to
cover a deficit.
Dr. Beard, after reading the list of
names, remarked that the Book Concern
had not been sufficiently In touch with the
ministers and congregations. He said he
was in favor of local control. He also said
that fifteen out of sixteen delegates to tha
General Conference signed a memorial

P^INISTERS DISCUSSED-^â
THEOLOGICAL SUBJECTS
THE criticism often has been made that In railroad trains,
waiting rooms, dining rooms, street cars, everywhere,
men are absorbed in the daily papers, while women either
do not read them or merely tkim the fashion and society
columns. Women, it is said, take no interest in current events
and hence are not fitted to participate in public affairs". A
philosophical explanation may be found in the old adage,
"Men have no need of keys who have no doors to unlock.
Men of at; classes scan the daily paper to learn the latest
development in politics with as much avidity as the school-
Kirl seizes upon the next chapter in the serial story. They
observe the political situation in other countries because in
a measure, it is Interwoven with their own They -feel this
kf>en interest because they themselves can help in the making
of ?his "history. It is natural that men should be deeply
interest-.! in matters which they themselves have power to
Sr "^hy a s ( hou?d tr women give that close attention to public af
fair*" Who cares for their opinion after it is formed? For
now much does it count in influencing? povernment?
It is said that the next year after the women of Colorado
were enfranchised more works on political economy were sold
than in all Its previous history. The women of that State ara
to-day as careful readers of the newspapers as are the men.
Give women everywhere the same incentive and they will be
come as well informed.
It is true that the masses of women do not keep so closely
in touch with current events as do the masses cf men, und yet
thousands of this generation have an intelligent understanding
of them where ten of the past had any knowledge whatever.
There is not one of the vital questions that are crowding upon
u=? so closely and rapidly at the present time which does not
affect women as deeply as it does men.
A Presidential election is now upon us with its momentous
questions. "Whatever may be Its results, whether the present
Administration is continued in power cr whether there 13 a
complete overturning and the establishment of a wholly dif
ferent system, women will gain or lose, thrive or retrograde,
find happiness or misery in exactly the same, proportion aa
men. â¢
And yet in all this making nnd administering of laws, in
this creating nnd deciding of great issues, this choosing of
the nation's rulers, women must be dumb as oysters, helpless
as babes, accepting in silence and submission whatever condi
tions are placed upon them, denied absolutely the freemen's
privilege of having their opinions registered and counted.
.Attention has been called to the fact that although

ARIZONA AND THE RANGES.
SOME weeks apo. in discussing the importance oi
adopting a system of leasing the grazing lands
of the and or semi-arid Territories for the pur-
I-^e of preventing that overstocking which has fol
lowed the free use of the ranges, The Call said: "The
Governor 01 Arizona has been quoted against the
policy of leasing the arid ranges to stockmen, with
a view to protect and renew the forage, increase the
moisture-holding capacity of the soil, and create a
fund for irrigation, fie i< said to favor the cession of
these ranges to the States."
We now learn from the Governor himself,
the Hon. X. O. Murphy, that he was mis
<;:;<jtcd. He says: "I have favored the leas
ivg of grazing lands for years. The only
point on which I have differed from others who
ii.vcr leasing is that I desire it done under State or
Territorial control, instead of rndcr the Federal Gov
ernment, for I believe that a better understanding is
had locally of conditions, and that whatever income
is derived from the leasing of these lands should go
to the State."
The Governor has a just rigiit to complain of the
nir-repre^crtation which misled The Call as to his
views, for he lias in official reports advocated leasing
in Arizona. In his report to the Secretary of the In
terior, for the year 1899. the Governor said: "One of
the most vexatious problems connected with the cattle
2.--A sheep business is that of satisfactorily dividing
the ranges between the cattle and the sheep men.
There is a constant conflict of interest between the
owners of cattle and the owners of sheep on account
of there being no authoritative method of limiting
the respective ranges on the public domain. No im
provement can be expected in this rc;pect until some
systematic mode of controlling the open ranges his
been devised and adopted. The question under pres
ent conditions frequent)}- proves a serious menace to
law and order. There arc some 30.000,000 acres of
prating lands in the Territory, and the problem would
be solved very quickly and permanent harmony es
tablished between these two branches of the grazing
industry if a system of leasing the ranges were
Whether the leafing of grazing lands can be better
carried out by a cession of the lands to the Territories
than by the National Government is an i>;sne we may
have occasion to discuss at another time. It suffices
for the present to set rit^lit the attitude of Governor
Murphy upon the main question of leading. We arc
glad to have liis influence on the right 5-ide of thi? im
portant problem, and regret that erroneous reports of
!:i<- policy led The Gil! into the statement that he "has
boon gabted" on the other side. k

has directed the establishment of wireless teleg
raphy in this harbor and in P.orto Rico and the Phil
ippines. The system is to be applied here to connect
the various points at which guns are located, so that
prompt and sure communication between them may
be had at all times. It is further announced that the
system may shortly be used in New York harbor,
since it has been found that the cables in the bay are
liable to be cut by shipping, and, moreover, experi
ments show that wireless telegraphy gives better re
sults than cables, v V : ;
The establishment of a Government system of wire
less telegraphy in San Francisco will be something
new for the Government, but not for the city. The
Call has already made use of wireless telegraphy and
proven its efficiency. It will be remembered that
when the transport bearing home from the Philippines
the California Volunteers arrived here the first in
formation of her appearance off the heads was given
by The Call, it having been transmitted to The Call
biiilding by wireless telegraphy from a vessel sta
tioned at sea and on the lookout for the transport.
The experiments made by The Call at that
time justified the sanguine expectations that
within a comparatively short time the system
would be extensively used. So remarkable, how
ever, did the feat seem at the time that many
persons doubted whether the system would ever
be extensively used. It was not until the splen
did reports obtained by The Call of the international
yacht race off New York harbor showed that thou
sands of words could be sent across wide stretches of
water by wireless telegraphy that the public- realized
that a new system of transmitting dispatches had been
devised, and that it -vould ere long be in general use.
Since the yacht r'ace the Government has taken up
the system and made elaborate experiments with it,
and the results are disclosed in the announcement that
wireless telegraphy is to be made use of here and
elsewhere. Marconi will never again be referred to
by the Examiner as "Macaroni." nor will that jour
nal renew its assertions that wireless telegraphy is a
fnke and a fraudT Even that paper has learned some
thing since the first record-making feat of The Call
with wireless telegraphy startled the world with a
demonstration of what the system can accomplish.
When the Government system is put into operation
it will hardly occasion more than a casual comment.
Wireless telegraphy is no longer a mystery nor a
marvel, as it was when The Call first demonstrated
its usefulness to journalism by using it to announce
the arrival of the California Volunteers, but has now
become one of- the recognized methods of telegraph
ing. So rapidly does the advance of science and in
vention go forward in our time.

Benjamin Ide Wheeler in Accord
With Father Yorke's Main Position
TRUSTS AND PARTIES.
/^OLONEL BRYAN has striven with all the
I power of speech which he possesses and
operates untrammeled by ideas, to establish the
statement that trusts flourish only under Republican
udministrations and are invented and fostered by Re
publicans and for Republicans. He has tried to es
tablish the wickedness of trusts and to make it ap
pear that no Democrat will have anything to do with
those 'criminal, combinations, except to go out and
acstroy them, as David did Goliath of Gath.
In this work Colonel Bryan has been ably seconded
by Mr. W. $L Hearst, who divides his time between
encouraging virtue and taking care of the material
happiness of mankind.
One day Mr. Hearst awoke from a deep dream of
the prevalence oi the white ribbon in the universal
buttonhole of the world, to hear that with the approach
01 hot weather an ice trust had been formed to make
it warm for the poor. Immediately this purist and
philanthropist hurried to his broker and bought into
tlic ice trust, in ofder that as a stockholder he might
get at the books and show that President McKinley,
Senator Hanna aryl other leading Republicans were
cornering the refrigeration of the coming summer.
When Mr. Hears? got his block of stock he besought
a court to judicially turn over the ice trust chip and
expose to the world's scorn the Republican bugs
thereunder. A court proceeded to turn over the chip,
and lo! there was Croker, 'Van Wyck and a wrig
gling mass of Tammany Democrats, every one with
an anti-trust plank for the Kansas City platform in his
hand and trust dividends in his pocket!
It was a sad disappointment, whichever way you
looked at it. Tammany is mad clear through and
threatens to retaliate by showing that the Hearst es
tate, from which comes the revenue to support the
anti-truÂ«t crusade of the Journal and Examiner, is
largely invested in :he copper trust, and sold part of
its copper holdings to Rothschild for the purpose of
organizing that metallic combination. Be this as it
may, there is anger in the camp and Colonel Bryan's
trusted anti-trust lieutenants are in doubt whether to
hold on to their dividends or to the prospects of po
litical promotion.
We may soon look for a sensational exposure in
volving Republicans in a beef tea trust, or a com
bination to corner icecream, or something of that sort,
tc offset this exposure of Tammany as the iceman.
The Republicans in Congress have proposed an
amendment. to the Federal constitution giving Con
gress jurisdiction over trusts and trade combinations
without abating or limiting any existing State juris
diction. As it is a question of interstate commerce its
prevention or regulation is of necessity a Federal
concern, and this amendment should pass in orderi
that a curb may soon be put upon an injurious sys
tem. The Democrats have taken a foolish position
as to this amendment. They have held a caucus on it
and decided to disfavor it, because they fear the Re
publicans are not sincere in proposing it! There is an
icy chunk of statesmanship for you! The only
proper criticism of the amendment is, will it serve
efficiently the purpose for which it is proposed? That
it will is obvious from its terms, and no one denies
that it puts the control or the prevention of these
combinations in the proper place. Then what has the
sincerity of its author to do with the matter, any
more than the color of his hair or the size of his shoe?
The Bryan men must think tlie country is easier to
fool than it ever was before. They must think that a
full belly can be misled ea?ier than an empty one was
in 1896. They must think that well employed and well
paid labor and business men winning a profit are
anxious to change back to the conditions of panic,
pinch and privation which were upon them five years
ago. But these politicians will be coldly undeceived.
The atmosphere of next November will need no re
frigeration for them by Mr. Croker. the Democratic
iceman. What ill? there are Republicans are com
petent to correct. The reform of them does not re
quire that our currency be debased, the public credit
destroyed, private prosperity ruined and labor starved.
Colonel Bryan'? programme is one of universal de
struction of all that is. in order that he may destroy
the gold standard, raise interest, debase all our cur
rency to the silver par, and extend the constitution
to the Philippines! The price asked is too high. The
country can get less harm at a. lower figure.
among Republicans themselves as to the policy that
should be pursued in dealing with them. The fact that
such differences were harmonized, and that bills pro
viding governments for both Hawaii and Porto
Rico were enacted with no factional disturb
ances i in the party, is itself a striking proof
of the capacity of the Republican party to
administer public affairs. When the record of the
party in that respect is contrasted with the wrangling
and muddling of the Democratic majority during
Cleveland's first term, it will be seen that another
proof has been furnished that Democracy is the party
of demagogy, and Republicanism is the party of legis
lation. The people can be safely intrusted to draw
from the contrast a .vise conclusion as to which party
shall be chosen at the coming election toK:arry on the
Government hereafter. "v< " "

to Detective Byrain, who after consider
able trouble found Figcnbaum at Mare

lunatic Byrain learned that he had Joined
the navy on April 35 and was considerd an
exemplary employe of Uncle Sam. After
a short conversation with Figcnbaum the
detective became convinced that he was
mentally sound, and so reported to Cap

WEDDING THAT RECALLS
AN ELOPEMENT ROMANCE
ci r^ YSTERY envelops the sudden â¢
//y/\ death of Emil D. Rosenbaum.
II JA \ capitalist, racetrack plunger and \
general all-round good fellow,
which occurred at his home, 2408 Van
Ness avenue, yesterday afternoon. At
first it was reported to have been the
result of an apoplectic stroke, but later a
letter hinting at suicide was dis
covered and a small box contain
ing poison was found on the dead
man's person and the conclusion was im
mediately arrived at that the man de
stroyed his own life. The reason given
for the suicide was that the unfortunate
capitalist could not settle his bills. The
farewell note to his wife, ln which he
informed her that he was about to end
his earthly troubles and enter another
world, was written on the back of a let
ter notifying him that two promissory
notes for $2000 and $500 respectively were
due at the Germania Trust Company.
The estate of the dead man is said to
approximate nearly half a million dollars
in value and his friends scoff at the idea
that monetary troubles overwhelmed him.
His near relatives say he was insane.
Rosenbaum was a member of the firm
of Rosenbaum Bros., capitalists and real
estate dealers. He owned considerable
property. A short time ago he made sev
eral notes and two days ago demand for
their payment was pressed upon him. In
his own words he owed $4000. Whether he.
could not settle with his creditors or
whether his mind was unbalanced re
mains yet to be determined.
Yesterday, according to his wife, he
complained of being ill. He was advised
to consult a physician, but refused on
the ground that he could not spend all
of his money in doctor bills. He iinally
lav down on a lounge in the parlor and
1ms family, thinking that his illness was
a trilling indisposition, left him alone.
\t half-]>ast 4 in the afternoon he was
found lying on the sofa, cold in death.
Mrs Roei'iibaum hurriedly called in Dr.
Krotozyner, but the physician being oc
cupied sent one of his nurses, Antone
Koiligs. Until that tlmo every person
concerned in the case believed doath was
due to natural causes. It remained for
the nurse to discover the real cause of
death and report it to the Coroner. When
Koiligs arrived at the house he at once
pronounced the man dead and an under
taker "was called. Mrs. Rosenbaum in
sisted upon an autopsy, and although she
attributed her husband's death to apo
plexy, still the fact that he had never
been 111 before in his life caused her. she
says, to be suspicious. Physicians were
called and the undertaker began to pre
pare the body for the autopsy surgeon's
knife. In the meantime tho case had
been reported to the Morgue by Dr.
Krotozyncr, who said Rosenbaum had
fallen dead at his home during the after
noon.
Kclliss, the nurse, had remained at the
house to assist in disrobing the body.
While thus engaged ho saw a letter lying
on a. table beside the lounge. On the
back of the envelope a few words writ
ten in load pencil arrested his attention.
They were:
SADIE: I owe J40G0 I pay. I or.-e
Zlck Abrahams $400. ]â¢;,}â¢ game. Grxvi-bye,
you have been a tood wife. KM1L..
When the nurse read this he opened the
letter and found it to be a communica-
tion from the Germania Trust Company,
reading as follows: !
JUNE 2. 1900.
Jlr. K. D. Rosenbaum, 234 Kront r^treotâ
Dear Sir: Tanr notes, dated February S. 1'tCO.
for Â»200<i. and March 24. for $500, with interest
from June 1, are now due and payable.

Kolllgs did not Inform the family of h!s
nnd, but Instead showed the letter to his
employer. The latter advised him to re
port tho matter at once to the Coroner,
which he did. Deputies Smith and Mee
han at once started out r.n the case and
took charge of the body. A small box
oi cyanide of potassium was found in a
pocket of the dead man's clothes.
The EÂ»ory of Rosenbaum's life is a
strange lale of a checkered career. A few
years ago he married Sadie McGuire, well
Known among those who roamed the city
at nielu. She seemed to have an unnat
ural inlluence over the man and at one.
time created a sen?atlon by producing
an ugly scar on her husband's head with
a bottle because she caught him dining
with another woman In a restaurant.
Roseiibauxn's relatives said last night
that he should possess money sufficient
to liquidate any obligation many times
tho amount for which he Is said to have
killed himself. They declare he mu?t
have been temporarily insane. In what
shape his property is, is yet to be deter
mined. Rumors were abroad last night
that at one time his wife forced him to
deed a large portion of his property to
her, but these rumors lack confirmation.
Upon tho death of the elder Rosenbaum
an estate amounting to millions was di
vided among several childrenâ Sam,
Charles, Albert and Emil Rosenbaum and
their sisters, Mrs. I. and Mrs. S. Struss
burger. What Kmil did with his money,
if he whs as ho stated in his note unable
to pay his bills, is yet to be ascertained.
He was called by the endearing name of
"Duxey" by his friends and was well
known "along the line."
During the past racing season "Duxey"
Uosenbaurr. wan known as the financial
backer of "Dagrgie" Smith, owner of Hor
ton, Torsida and other horses. Smith's
stable proved an Inconsistent one to fol
low and although credited with a "kill
ing" or two, "Duxey" never became
known to fame as a successful plunger.
In fact so unfortunate was he In separat
ing the fast from the slow horses that
his bank roll assumed a famished look
and he was compelled to turn to the
money lenders. Amonp those to whom he
was Indebted was Zick Abrahams, the !
poolroom proprietor. Previous . to the '
closing of the racing season Abrahams j
honored a draft calling for S300. presented
by "D.iggie" Smith, and later cashed an- i
other for S100. the coin also being paid to i
Smith. On Saturday last Rosenbaum i
called on Abrahams, expressing sorrow at i
not having made good the loan and an- '
parently In the best of spirits said: "I'll i
settle up with you at 1 o'clock on Mon-!
day, Zlck." His sudden death caused the J
greatest surprise in turf circles, where ho
was generally known and respected.

Transport Meade to Be Held
Another Week in
Quarantine.
Mail Steamer JEariposa Has Been Tu-
xnigated and Will Probably Bo Al
lowed to Dock at Pacific-Street
Wharf To-Day.
The transport Meade will not be re
leased from quarantine until the middle of
next week. Another case of smallpox
broke out in the steerage- a couple of day3
ago and that will necessitate the deten
tion of the ship at the quarantine grounds.
The cabin passengers were landed yester
terday afternoon. All of them were vac
cinated and their clothes thoroughly
fumigated before Dr. Kinyoun allowed
them to leave the transport.
General Otis and his staff came ashore
shortly before noon on the steamer Grace
Barton, but the rest of the passengers
did not get away until 4 p. m., when the
tug Fearless brought them to the city.
The Meade got away from the quaran
tine hulk Sunday night and. the mall
steamer Mariposa took her place early
yesterday morning. She was thoroughly
fumigated and moved into the Â¦ stream
agafn last night. The chances are she
will be released to-day and dock at Paci
fic-street wharf. As soon as her steer
age passengers are landed she will go
to the sugar refinery to discharge and
coal.
Sailed for Nome.
The steamer San Juan got away prompt
ly at 1 p. m. yesterday fbr the gold fleld3.
She carries a full cargo of general mer
chandise for the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, but only took a few passengers from
here. The San Juan is to call at Seattle,
where 400 gold hunters, booked by John
Kosenfeld's Sons, will board her.
The steamer Newsboy was also to have
sailed for Nome yesterday, but it will
be noon to-day before she gets away. The
Newsboy will take away about a hundred
passengers and expects to make Nome as
soon as any of the fleet.
National City Damaged.
There were only two arrivals yester
dayâthe steamer Corona from southern
ports and the National City from Fort
Bragg. When the latter was passing out
on June 3 she ran into a heavy cross
sea and an ugly 3outhwest swell. A
heavy wave carried away the deck lash
ings and 500 railroad ties were .swept
overboard. Some of the crew had a nar
row escape.
Water Front Notes.
There were only four departures yester
dayâthe Coos Bay. San Juan, Point
Arena and Tlllamook â all steamers. Not
a wind-jammer spread a sail, although
there is quite a number ready for sea.
The British ships Chiltonford, Bardowie,
Primrose Hill and Kensington are â¢ de
tained for want of crews and some of the
coasters are tn a like predicament. There
is a chance for an exodus in a few days,
however, as the boarding masters have
now nearly enough men on hand to man
all the fleet.
The schooner Challenger arrived from
Port Ludlow after a psssage of five days.
This is one of the smartest runs of the
season and nearly equals steamboat
time. â¢
The quartermaster's steamer McDowell,
after a thorough overhauling at the Ful
ton Iron Works, will resume her trips to
the various army posts to-day. The Mc-
Dowell has had new boilers put in and
was fitted with a new Wittram propeller.

communication has been published. Mr.
O"Donne!l's letter Is as follows:
... Â¦ Â¦ ,. . :_ Â¦Â¦ , - "< ,;.-.
SAN FHANCISCO, June 4. 1900.
F. \V. Dohrmannâ Sir: Vuur communication
dated the I'd intt. reached me this morning,
it l.:iving been left at my office on Saturday
during rv.y absence from the city, otherwise I
should have afforded you an* earlier rtply.
At the discussion of the tax levy before the
Board of Supervisors en last Thursday evening
In opp. Â«ing thÂ« proposed outlay by the Board
of Pub!ic Wcrks of moneys for street sprink
ling I stated that I had information which led
rt:e to the belief that you were personally In
terested in the City Street Improvement Com
pany. The information to which I referred
was Rleaned from' a conversation had by Hon.
John T. Pare and myself with John W. Me
3>cnald. manager of the City Street Improve
ment Company. laFt year at the City Hall, at
which ti:ne, as Mr. l>nr? and mys-lf observed,
Mr. McDonald was unable to speak or act for
the company without first consulting you. At;
that T!:ne Mr. Dare and myself were defend- '
ing the little property ln watering carts which
supported a few widows and orphans and
others whV as the husbands and lathers be
fore them, had been engaged in the business
of sprinkling the pavements ln front of Etore.8 i
ln Lbta city, at the private exr*nse of the
merchants, who have bt-en well satisfied to
personally pay for such sprinkling. The sig
natures of hundreds of those merchants ln
behalf of sprinkling at private expense and
sustaining the industry of those pour people
were appended to petitions before street com
mittee after street committee whenever you
have ir.ade your several attacks upon the busi
ness of those jM>.;r people during the past Mx
years. It has be*>n shown time and again be
fore the various street committees that in all
the lars f - cities of the Kast no paved streets i
are watered at public expense. That fact was j
proven by letters received from orlic-lals of
those cities ar.d read before the strfet com
mittee of which Adolph Spreckels was chair
man and others.
My belief that you are interested in the City
Street Improvement Company was further con
firmed when after many fruitless endeavors on
your part to Interfere with the business of my
clients you took steps to Induce the Hoard .of
Supervisors last year to pass an ordinance
making it a misdemeanor to sprinkle bitumin
ous pavements. Pending the consideration of
that ordinance my clients and many property
owners protested against the tatM and applied
to Mayor Phelan to withhold hiÂ« approval
therefrom. His Hpnor. the Mayor, refused,
giving as a reasun that Air. Duhrmann and
John \V. McDonald advised him to sign said
ordinance.
AftÂ«=r advocating the ordinance last referred
to and crippling the business of my clients
you <Â»xhibltt'd your consistency several months
later by advocating Us repeal. It Is singularly
suspiclcus that this s .mersault of yours should
occur within the last few weeks, at a time
when the Board of Public "Works were about
to advertise fcr proposals for that very kfnd
of work; and It is still more remarkable. Mr.
rvÂ»hrni.'>nn, thatâ according to the statement of
Leo I'ark, secretary of the Board of Public
Works, before the Finance Committee of the
Hoard of isors on Tuesday, the Cld day
of last monthâ you prepared .for the Board of
Public Works the specifications for uprinklins
under said proposals and interjected provisions
therein which operated against my cllentsvand
in favor of the City Improvement Com
pany. It 1? indeed to he wondered at, Mr.
l)>ihrma.nn. if > "U prepared those specifications.
as stated by Mr. Hark, and had only the pub
lic interest in view, that you includM in your
schedule miles of strc.-ts which the City Street
Improvement Company are already bound to
keep sprinkled continuous!;: und^r a contract,
the specifications of which were also nrepared
by you; which contract doee not expire until
January. 1SU1- If euch be the case you have
ai<ied in optnins? up an avenue by which the
City Street Improvement Company could, dur
ing the next six months, successfully! draw
payment twice from the city for the same
work.
I have herein detailed some of thÂ» informa
tion which has formed my belief that you are
personally Interested in the City Street Im
provement Company. In this matiT. aÂ» I
have siM before. I am endeavoring to main
tain the little property en whl^h my clients
depend for the subr-istence of th'-mselvrs an 1
families and do not propose to retrace one stop
befoic their assailant even though he be
wrapjWl In tlie mantle of the Merchants' Asso
ciation. Yours truly.

NEW TORK, June 4. â The stock market re
lapÂ»Â«?d again in the reactionary condition,
rhowlng the same apathy and hesitation which
characterized it for sor^e time previous to the
elight fillip which gave an appearance of some
animation and *trenÂ»rth last week. There were
times to-day when stocks were offered quite
freeljr and In considerable variety and the
entire absence of demand made prices vul
nerable to the efforts by professional bears to
set them to a lower leveL The actual news
of the day offered little to account for tne
â¢weakness in the market. Probably the cor
rect explanation is the conviction now become
general in Wall Ftreet that last week's buying
was due to the closing up of some extensive
short accounts by one or two operators on a
larjre seal*. While that demand found very
rcanty offering? of stocks it failed entirely to
attract any additional demand. Commission
bouse business tru at a very low ebb. There
was isome speculation in Sugar to-day, based
upon dividend prospects. It was expected that
the quarterly dividend would be declared to
day, but It was announced during the trading
that action would be de-ferrt-d until to-mor
row. Intimations were given out, however,
that the executive committee had already de
termined on a 1*4 per cent dividend for the
Â«juÂ»rter. the name as heretofore. The price
iv. ..- run up to !> on this rumor, but later
fell back below Saturday's price, closing a
Fhade tit! on the day. The Whitsuntide holi
days in London and op the Continent left the
market without any inaex of foreign conditions.
Fome sentimental depression was caused, how
<ner. l>y the delay in the occupation of Pre
toria arid by EugReFti"ns of money market dif
ferences In B?rlln. ThÂ» bears professed Â«ome
uneasiness also over possible comi.Iications In
the Far East. The closing of the Illinois Steel
Company's mills In South Chicago made steel
Ftocks especially Â«vak early In the day. but
the tone cf the group became steadier in the
late weakness of the market. A rise of
3 points in NÂ«-w Jersey Central caused a tem
porary hardening of the coalers, but it did
not hold. The small brokerage failure an
nounced (Jurinu the iiay was without effect on
thÂ»- market.

CHICAGO, June 4.â The corn market, while
not active to any extent, developed sufficient
strength during the a?sslon to aid. .the
struggling prices of other commodities. Coun
try acceptances of Chicago bids were an im
portant factor as they were much smaller than
usual of late. Besides this the cash people did
an excellent business, much of It direct ship
ment despite higher lake rates and the holi
day abroad. Shorts were compelled to cover,
aiding in the advance. July closed at 37i4@
3Sc. a gain of HS'Hc
The wheat trade was dull. The market
opened easy, July 14c depressed at 6C!ic to
66 l ic under the influence of rains Sunday In
the Northwest and the general speculative dull
ness. More rains were predicted for the Da
kotas and neighboring territory and the Kan
pas crop was advertised as prospectively the
largest on record. But the market got no
lower than the opening figures. There were
other considerations, chief of which were the
corn stscngth and damage claims from the
Northwest. From the country mentioned there
were numerous complaints that the rains had
coir-.e too late to be of the fullest benefit,
while other sources declared that general rains
alone could presarve the crop from widespread
Injury. July advanced to 66?ic, at which the
market closed, Vs^Vic over Saturday.
The oats market was dull. The corn strength
sustained the .market, July closing He higher.
The provision market was strong and at times
It was active. Hog receipts were large, but
packers reported that they had to pay good
prices for them all the same. There was a
better outside demand, packers were fair buy
ers and shorts covered moderately, while of
ferings were not free. July pork closed 22^ic
over Saturday, lard 10c higher and ribs 17Vs5Â£
20c up.

When the case was submitted two

He said both parties were to blame and

The question of attorneys' fees will be

OAKLAND, June 4.â Judgo Hall made
an order this afternoon directing Alonzo
W. Fink to pay JS5 a month to his wife
for the support of herself and their
daughter. Mrs. Fink asked for $100 a
month, but the court deemed the smaller
amount sufficient to supply the needs of
herself and daughter. Fink, who is a
well-known commission merchant of San
Francisco, was sued several months &go
by his wife for a divorce on the pround
of extreme cruelty. The case, which was
tried behind closed doors, was replete
with sensational testimony. The plaintiff
accused her husband of gross cruelty,
while he in turn brought counter-charges
to the effect that Mrs. Fink had accepted
the attentions of other men. Letters of
an alleged incriminating character were
offered in evidence by the defendant's at

"At the meeting of the Board of Super
visors this morning the question was
brought up, and it was decided to bring
suit against County Assessor Henry P.
Dalton for the recovery of $3323 13, the
amount claimed to be illegally held by
him as his commission on the collection of
poll taxes for last year.
Dalton claims the money in question un
der a provision of the county government
act. which allows the Assessors of coun
ties of the first class to retain 15 per cent
of all moneys collected as poll tax. The
county contests the Assessor's right to
the money under a different section of
the act, which provides that all such
moneys must be paid at once into the
county treasury.
The refusal of Assessor Dalton to turn
the disputed amount into the treasury has
given rise to serious complications In the
apportionment of the State school fund.
Controller Colgan has refused to make an
allowance for Alameda County until he
has received all the money he claims is
due, and consequently until the matter
is settled the schools of this county must
get alorg without State assistance.
The decision of the Sacramento County
Superior Court in the suit of State Con
troller Colgan against Assessor Henry P.
Dalton for the collection of commissions
alleged to have been illegally withheld
for the collection of poll taxes in thla
county has prompted the Board of Super
visors of Alameda County to bring an ac
tion for the recovery of the money. It
was decided by tho Sacramento court
that the State Controller had no legal
right as plaintiff In a suit for the col
lection of poll tax commissions, but that
the Supervisors of this county were the
officials to bring the matter into court.

MONTEREY. June 4.â News has been
received from the vicinity of Syndicate
Camp, on the upper Carmel. that consid
erable alarm is being caused among the
inhabitants of that section by a lunatic.

worn out with fatigue and Illness and
claiming to have come recently from Ohio,
arrived at the camp and asked a night's
lodging at one of the houses. He was
taken in by the family, but the next
morning he disappeared and has since
been seen only at intervals. He lives ap
parently in the chaparral and when ap
proached by any one he immediately t;ik<-s
flight and hides. When last seen his
clothes were In tatters, and as he has
nothing to eat except what ho finds In the
woods It is feared he will die of starva
tion and exposure unless captured and
placed under surveillance.
The young man bore the marks of re
finement and is evidently violently Insane.
No clew to his identity has yet been ob
tained.

The Oakland Tribune has started a fund
Tor the families of the dead trainmen
ar.d has alrr-ndy raised over JIWO for them
by subscriptions.
The railroad company has opened nego
tiations with the widows for a settlement
of their claims asrain^t the eompanv. As
the> accident was clearly the result of
carelcpFnoss upon the part of the switch
men the claims of the widows would be
good and the company is anxious to com
promise thorn.
The dismissal of thesj men from the
fervice of the Southern Pacific means
that they will rot be employed again by
th*> company unless they are first rein
stated. Jt amounts practically to placing:
tnr-lr names on the black list.
The two trainmen who were killed In
this wreckâ Er.plnocr Shaw and Fireman

tense that he was the owner cf valuable
property in Contra Costa County which
he was willing to trade for the hotel
business conducted by Lindeman in the
Windsor block. The hotel was assigned
to Allen, but he never carried out his
agreement with regard to the country
real estate. According to his Â¦ accuser.
Lindeman, he sold the hotel furniture and
would have left the country had he not
been apprehended. -;"â¢Â¦:

guilty and Judge Opden Imposed a sen
tence of five years in San Quentin. An

remained until his sudden death relieved
him from his earthly responsibilities.

SAN RAFAEL, June 4.â Last Frlday'9
election of School Trustees at Tiburon has
thrown the county officials Into consider
able trouble. \V. R. Hansen, J. J. Wosser
and Miss Kate O'Connor were candidates.
All three were duly -elected, but it has
been ascertained that Miss O'Connor is
only 17 years of age, and therefore in
eligible to public office.
The election was further complicated by
the fact that the majority of the voters
had failed to get on the new register, ns
required by law. This in itself, it is held,
would invalidate the â¢ election. County
Superintendent of SchoolH Robert Furlong
ssays that the whole election Is void.

CO-EDS PLAYED BASKET
BALL AGAINST ORDERS
What was worse they had to face the
faculty and answer the charge of dis
obedience when they returned. They
pleaded that they did not play as the
university of California team. After hav
ing every guilty co-ed before them the
faculty thought it best to quietly drop
the matter and the terrified girls escaped.
I he members of the team were: Gert

The game was played and the Berkeley
co-eds went down to defeat by a score of
6 to 3.
BERKELEY, June 4.â The University
of California basket ball team in
curred the displeasure of the fac
ulty of the university just as the
term closed, and though attempts were
made to keep the matter quiet the fact
has leaked out that the frame formed the
subject of an investigation by the pro
fessors. The young ladies were accused
of having disobeyed an order of the fac
ulty and they were all ordered to make
explanations. They proved to the faculty
that they had very skillfully evaded its
order nnd as the term was about to closo
the matter was allowed to drop. But th?
investigation made the young ladles who
composed the team nervous while It
lasted.
Just before the close of the unlverslty
the faculty issued an order to the basket
ball team that they should not play a
game with any other college during the
term. Then the team from Stanford Uni
versity sent a challenge to the Berkeley
co-eds. At first the Berkeley team with
stood the temptation to meet their rivals,
but the youiiK ladies from Palo Alto made
the dare more emphatic and the Berkeley
co-eds could stand it no longer. But
there was the faculty order to overcome.
That was easily done. They changed the
name of the team to "The Maprnolias."

SUPERVISORS RECEIVE
BIDS FOR SUPPLIES
Declare the Methods Adopted by
Idaho's Governor* and General
Merriam at Wardner "Were
Outrageous.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â The minority
report of the Coeur d'Alene Investigation
was given out to-day by Representatives
Lentz of Ohio and Hay of Virginia, who
drafted it.
The minority- points out that the evi
dence taken during .the investigation
shows that there was absolutely no riot
ing in Shoshone 'County, Idaho, after
April 29, 1S&9; that when the United
States . troops arrived upon the scene
quiet had been restored anu no resistance
was being made to the State authorities,
who were arresting as rapidly as possible
those who were suspected of being impli
cated in the crime of April 29, 1S99.
It is maintained by the minority that
the troops sent to Idaho by the President
continued to be under control of the
President and that the military com
mander in charge could use the .Troops
only in aid of the civil authorities to pre
serve peace and order and to prevent re
sistance being made by lawless persons
to the process of the courts and the proper
civil authorities of the State. -
The President of the United States has
kept and is still keeping soldiers in that
community, and by uoing so is upholding
a tyrannical course of conduct pursued by
the Governor of Idaho.
The minority points out the following
flagrant instances of abuse of power and
violation of law by General Merriam, the
commander of the troops:
Firstâ General Merriam sent on May 3 about
150 troops to the town of Burke and arrested
without warrant the entire male population
of that town, consisting of about 300 persons.
It was an outrage of the liberty of the citi
zens which has no parallel In the annals of
this country.
Second â General Merriam sent a detachment
of troo,os into the State of Montana for the
purpose of arresting fugitives from the
State of Idahoâ an inexcusable exercise of ar
bitrary power by General Merriam.
Thirdâ Lieutenant Lyon. acting under order
of his superior officer, by threats of violence,
forced certain citizens to work In the Tleer-
Poorman mine against their will. No other such
flagrant invasion of the right of the citizen
can be cited In the history of this country.
Fourthâ Major Smith suppressed the Mullen
Mirror, a newspaper published at Mullen, thus
denying free speech and free press. This was
a gross violation of the law, wholly unjusti
fied.
The permit system, In fact a blacklist sys
tem, approved by General Merriam and kept
In operation to this day by the pressnee of
the military forces of the United States, is
a violation of law which - cannot be de
fended.
In summing up the minority members
of the committee say they are satisfied
from the evidence adduced that General
Merriam was wholly mistaken as to his
powers and duties; that his conduct has
resulted In the gravest injustice to the
liberty of individuals. They continue:
Innocent men have been kept in prison for
months without trial, and have been finally
discharged without any charges being pre
ferred acalnet them. *
At one time or another there were over 1100
men In the prison at Wardner. known as the
"bull pen." They were kept there many
months. They were riot tried. They were
not charged with any crime; they were held
and guarded by United States troops. It was
the duty of General Merriam and of the Presi
dent of the United States to Inquire into the
causes and reasons for the detention of so
many American citizens. No such inquiry was
ever made. Such Indifference is hard to un
derstand and harder to excuse.
The plea, that General Merriam was acting
at the request of the Governor of Idaho and
his State representative, Bartlett Sinclair, is
not good. Neither the Governor nor Sinclair
had the right to violate 'the law. and General
Merriam knew it, or he should have known it.
Although the Governor of Idaho has for
a year and more been governing Shoshone
County by martial law, he has never called
the Legislature together. The laws of Idaho
provide that a session of the Legislature can
be called on twenty days' notice. The minor
ity hold that the President is not justified in
keeplntr United States soldiers indefinitely In
Shoshone County at the mere will of one man.
when the Legislature, representative of the
people, could have and ought to be convened
and their wishes ascertained.

does and the Engineer Throws
Open the Throttle and
Leaves Them.
LOXGVIEW, Tex., June 4.â The north- I
bound "cannon-ball" train on the Inter
national and Great Northern wa9 held up
after midnight near Price's Switch, sixty
miles south of this city, and but for the
plucky fight of Express * Messenger
Charles Rutherford and Baggagemaster
Jame3 Strong and the strategy of En
gineer Charles Rich another robbery
wou'd have taken place.
The engineer saw a pile of crossties and
a lantern on the track and stopped. He
was ordered down by three masked men,
who forced him and the fireman to un
couple the mail, bagrgage and express cars
and to pull about two miles from the re
mainder of the train. The robbers then
commanded the messenger to open the
door of his car, and. failing to get any
response, made Fireman Love break a
hole in the end with a coal pick.
While this was being done the fireman
begged the messenger and baggage
master not to shoot. The messenger,
who was well protected by a barricade,
said he would kill the first man to enter
the hole. Love was forced in and the
messenger shouted, "Get aside. Love," aa
he fired through the hole. His shot Just
missed the robbers, who undertook to
kill the messenger, by shooting through
the side of the car.
In the confusion resultlnr Engineer
Rich crawled up to his engine, pulled tha
throttle wide open and left the rohbers
behind. A quick run was made to Jack
sonville, fifteen miles to the north. At
daybreak the penitentiary bloodhounds
were brought from Rusk and put on the
trail of the robbers.
This hold-up occurred near the place
where the same train was robbed five
years ago.

AFTER THE SCALPS OF
MIEHLING AND BARTH
Changes in Public School Physical
Culture Department Are
Impending. ; .
The Board of Education Is considering
the condition of the physical culture
cÂ«jurÂ»e in the public schools and the out
come will probably be the discharge of
the two teachers now employed in that
departmentâ Professor Miehling and Pro
fessor Baxth.
Under the present system the teachers
visit each school about once In every five
or six weeks, and in some districts the
visits average but little more than one In
three months. Only the hours of a morn
ing are devoted to thÂ« children. The
board believes that principals and teach
ers are fully competent to teach the chil
dren as much physical culture as they are
getting now and that there is no use for
two high-saJaried Instructors with but lit
tle to do. It was reported at one time
that Professor Hoover would be put in
the department In place of Miehling and
Barth, but perhaps the department will
be abandoned altogether. This will de
pend upon the appropriation. But in any
event it look? as if the scalps of Miehllns
and Barth will adorn the walls of the
boardroom before long.
The Democrats of San Francisco are ad
monished by Phelan's court circular that
too much apathy exists in the party. It is
not difficult for politicians of ordinary
gumption to ascertain the cause of the
general apathy. There Is too much Phe
lan In the programme for the State con
vention. More than 69 of the 112 members
of the Democratic County Committee
would have attended the convention at
Native Sons' Hall last Friday evening If
the word had not been passed along the
line by the court circular that the district
commltteemen were not ready to submit
a list of delegates to the State convention.
One of the delinquent districts was the
Thirty-eighth, represented in part by
Mayor Phelan's private Civil Service Com
missioner, Charles W. Fay. There are
many obstacles in the way of 'selecting a
Phelan delegation from this Assembly dis
trict.' Democrats of the better class dis
trust Phelan and despise his methods.
They would rather keep out of politics
entirely than Join hands with him In the
manipulation of a convention. .
The delegation representing the Thirty
eighth District in the county committee
originally consisted of eight members. One
went Â¦ to Honolulu and another was ap
pointed on the Fire Commission, leaving
six for Fay to manage, or five, excluding
himself.. As the Mayor's private Civil
Service Commissioner, he appointed Com
mitteeman Lynch to a clerkship in the
Registrar's office. Lynch is there now,
constituting one of the surplus clerks men
tioned by the Federated Improvement
Clubs. This appointment did not give Fay
sufficient strength to control the delega
tion for Phelan, so he concluded to ex
tend the spirit of civil service reform by
promising to appoint Commltteeman Finn
of the Thirty-eighth to a position In the.
Department of Public Works. If Finn ac
cepts the delegation will stand three for
Phelan and three against. Something
more must be done by the private Civil
Service Commissioner before to-morrow
night. The convention may bo In no mood
for a second adjournment in order to give
Phelan time to fix up a slate.
A great roar will come from the Inland
Democrats when the programme is pre
sented to the State convention. On the
slate will be seen the names of Stephen
M. .White. James G. Maguire, M. F. Tar
pey and James D. Phelan for delegates at
large. The plan to take three delegates
from San Francisco and "one from Los
Angeles will not delight tho. representa
tives hailing from the valleys of the San
Jdaquln and Sacramento. Northern "and
Central California delegates may arise in
their wrath and smash the slate.

MERCHANTS ORGANIZE.
Citizens' Kelief Committee Will Con-
sist of Thirty Members.
A meeting of the merchants was held
yesterday In the Chambers of the Board
of Trade. An organization to be known as
as the Citizens' Relief Committee, with a
membership of thirty Instead of ten, as
was proposed at a previous meeting, was
perfected. Sub-committees were also ap
pointed and will report to the Board of
Health for instructions as to how to pro
ceed toward carrying out their specific du
ties; also to learn the necessities of the
board and to provide money.
The first matter taken up was the ap
pointment of the general committee. The
names of A. C. Rulofson, William Haas,
A. A. Watkins, H. E. Cuthbert. Eugene
Goodwin, Walter Castle, William Cluff,
M. H. Hecht, Adam Grant, George W.
McNear Jr., A. W. Porter, Lawrence Har
ris. William McDoriald, Andrew Davl?,
Raphael Weill, F. W. Dohrmann, Wil
liam Buckingham, J. K. Wilson, Joseph
Sloss and S. J. Hendy were added to the
ten originally appointed. A. A. Watkins
was chosen permanent chairman upon the
resignation of William Thomas and Eu
gene Goodwin was named as permanent
secretary. Andrew Carrigan presided. at
the meeting held yesterday.
The members of the committee were In
structed as to the soliciting of subscrip
tions In the commercial districts. Tho
division of labor in this line will be made
on a basis of Industries. - ' .
The following sub-committees were ap
pointed to assume charge of various mat
ters and to expend the money collected:
Commissaryâ George W. McNear, William
Haas and William duff; pressâ A. A. "Watktns.
Andrew Carrigan and Rufus P. Jennings: aud
itoryâS. NlekelPDurg. Joseph Bloss and W. T.
Button; quarantineâ A. C. Rulofson, Andrew
Carrigan and R. P. Schwerln; detention camp
â M. H. Hecht. A. A. Watklns and A. C. Ru
lofson; sanitationâ Walter Castle, Lawrence
Harris and Rufus P. Jennings. ..
A resolution was passed making the
chairman, treasurer and secretary a com
mittee on finance. Joseph Sloss was elect
ed secretary of this committee and the
Anglo-Californlan Bank treasurer. The
meeting then adjourned. '
from $1200 to $500, and McCarthy moved
that a matron for the Morgue be pro
vided at $720 per year, which motions
were both adopted.
The Recorder was given $34,520, out of
which he may employ one mortgage clerk
at $1200, two Index clerks at $1200 each
and one messenger at $900 per annum. The
$24,000 for copyists, however, was cut to
$21,600.
The amount for publishing the delin
quent tax list was reduced from $5000 to
$3750 on Tobin's representation that the
cost this year was $3667 59.
Treasurer Brooks made an earnest ap
peal that he be granted two extra clerks
as originally scheduled. The work of the
office had Increased at 'least 35 per cent
and on that representation the clerks
were allowed.
Deputy County Clerk Goddard asked for
money for four additional copyists and
one messenger in addition to the $75,400
recommended. The work of the office, he
said, was four months behind and the de
partment would be greatly crippled un
less relief was afforded.
The Mayor held that the need for extra
help in the County Clerk's office was not
apparent, and that no complaints regard
ing the efficiency of the office had ever
come to his notice. A motion to allow
one extra copyist was carried.
Reed moved that the $2400 for the law
and motion calendar be not allowed on
the ground that it was not a proper
charge against the city. Tobin explained
that the appropriation was based on the
recommendation of the Superior Judges,
but the appropriation- was stricken out.
D'Ancona gave notice of reconsideration
and the $2100 was restored to the budget.
Judge Cabaniss* plea for an Increase
from two to three stenographers in the
Police Court was successful.
Sheriff JLackmnnn asked that four addi
tional guards to superintend road - work
be allowed. He estimated that with an
expenditure of $2400 the roads could be
improved to the extent of $10,000, besides
doing $3000 worth of farm work. The ex
tra guards were allowed.
Curtis here introducedan amendment to
his resolution extending an invitation to
the peace envoys of the South African re
pubUcs to visit this city, which was de
feated at the afternoon session. He elim
inated the clause sympathizing with the
Boers and the resolution prevailed.
Reed advocated an increase In the ap
propriation for examination of available
sources for a water supply from $20,000 to
$30,000, In order that the provisions of the
charter and platform of the party might
be carried out, and the Increase was
adopted.
McCarthy urged that the appropriation
of $10,000 for the improvement of Troca
dero Gulch be included in the appropria
tion for improvements to be made by the
Board of Public Works. ,Mr. Pope ad
dressed the board, and asked that it keep
its promise to provide for the improve
ment made when the appropriation -was
surrendered three months ago. Mr. Pope
said tnat the property owners had ex
pended $50,000 to Improve Nineteenth ave
nue, and the improvement of the gulch
was ordered^
Reed objected to appropriating 510.000
for abstracts of title to the property In
the Park Panhandle district on the
ground that the abstracts should be paid
for out of the sales of bonds. The Mayor
stated that condemnation proceedings
could not begin until the abstracts were
furnished. Reed said that as soon as a
decision on the bond question was handed
down the bonds could be sold. Reed
thought that the chances are that the de
cision would be against the issue and that
$10,000 should not be squandered on a con
tingency. The appropriation, however,
was not disturbed.
McCarthy renewed his crusade against
the Department of Public Health by raov-
Inc that the expenses be reduced from
$02,000 to $G7,5C0. but the motion was lost.
The Twenty-sixth street Hospital was
given a subsistence account of $2100, to be
deducted from the City and County Hos
pital appropriation of $30,000.
McCarthy's motion to cut It to $S0,000
was lost. '
The Department of Electricity suffered
a cut of $20,151 from Its original appropria
tion. -
The Fire Department was allowed $708,
71S. , Reed moved that the Department of
Elections be allowed $124,900, an Increase
of $15,000. for a 'special election for the
acquisition of a public lighting plant, but
the -motion was lost. .The appropriation
stood at $109,900.
The Civil Service Commission was al
lowed/ JSICO. which Includes the salaries of
a clerk and typewriter.
The sum of $4000 was apportioned to pay
amounts due for services of appraisers of
property- on extension- of the Park Pan
handle.
The original. estimate of 51,090.000 for tne
School Department was* Increased by $20.
<OOO for repairs Â¦ and IJO.OOO for school jan
itors, these funds being taken from the
Board of Public Works.
The J500Q.set aside for altering the park
lodge so as to lit it. for public use was
changed to Improve the hospital park lot
on the representation of Boxton that the
property owners . would spend an addi
tional $3000. but another $5000 was appro
priated for the first mentioned purpose.
Increasing the full appropriation to ?*Â«â¢
000 for the park. , ,
Just before . adjournment, Brandenstein
engaged in a wordy war with Reed over
the increase in the appropriation frotn
$10,000 to $30,000 for examination of public
utilities, and moved that It be fixed at
$20,000, but the motion was lost. â¢ The bal
ance of $GSGO in the revised appropriations
was transferred to the fund for Improv
ing streets.
The merchants have taken a hand in the
quarantine of Chinatown and the result
of their Interest is another batch of rules
for the tightening of the dead line. The
State Boarl of Health wants to take a
hand, too, but the Governor will not au
thorize any steps until he has had a look
Into the situation himself, and he will
look into It all the sooner because of a
communication from Secretary of State
Hay requesting that he make a report
upon the condition of affairs here. And it
Is more than certain that the better class
of the Chinese have taken a hand and are
working through the Minister at Washing
ton to have the situation made at least
bearable for the indigent Inside the lines.
Chue Yet, president of the Chinese Mer
chants' "Exchange, has taken a keen In
terest in those to whom the quarantine is
a double hardshipâ that is the poor who
have no money to buy food and no chance
to earn any. and he has been credited
with a communication that has gone on to
Washington protesting against the action
of the local authorities as being in viola
tion of the treaty between this country
and China and Â« calling - attention to the
urgent need for some effort In behalf of
those who cannot help themselves.
The Chinese Minister has been informed
that there are at least seven thousand
Chinese in quarantine who are in actual
need of food and he knows, too, that they
have appealed to the local Health Board
in vain. This may have been the begin
ning of the effort to establish the deten
tion camp on Angel Island, for the local
Board of Health Is now seeking accom
modations for at least eight thousand in
digent and hungry Chinese condemned to
isolation. Steps were taken at the board
meeting yesterday to send fifteen hundred
over to Mission Rock to-day, for the
board has secured the consent of the Cali
fornia Drydock Company to use the old
wharf. But it is well known that Mis
sion Rock is too small to be of much, use
and bo the scheme of establishing a camp
on Angel Island will be carried through.
It will cost at least $7500 to put the place
in condition, and when it is ready It will
be under Federal control. It is claimed
there is too much routine and red tape in
the local system, and the Federal authori
ties are gradually reaching for the con
trol of the situation. They are probably
hurried by the fact that Chinese and
Japanese are leaving the State, and the
destinations of not more than half of them
are known. With. several thousand of the
indigent on Angel Island, a Government
station and 1500 more on Mission Rock,
to which the Government is laying claim,
the class most liable to disease will be
well under the Federal wing and the Fed
eral quarantine officer will practically be
With the Indigent out, too, Chinatown
can be cleaned thoroughly and with dis
patch for it is the indigent that collect
the filth and live in surroundings that in
vite contagion.
At the meeting of the board yesterday
afternoon it was decided to further draw
the quarantine lines- and make them ab
solute against all but the officers and
members of the Board of Health. To that
end the following report from the quaran
tine committee was adopted:
Tho quarantine at present is defective . In
many ressccts and flagrant infractions of the
regulations are being reported daily. With an
earnest desire to remedy these evils and to
bring the quarantine, in fact as vrcll as in
name, up to the proper standard, we recom
mend the adoption without delay of the fol
lowing measures:
Stoppage of streetcar travel through the dis
trict quarantined, surrounding the infected
area with a double cordon of sruards, and a
detail of sixty policemen - at :â¢ Portsmouth
ttquare,-to be used for presTVlnB order in thn
district; placing, wherever practicable.- barbed

CHINATOWN TO
BE CLEARED OF
ALL ITS POOR
â¢ Â« IS Honor the Mayor has been made to feel again that he is not the whole thing in San Francisco. Basking in
â¢ II the smiles of his few and faithful flatterers, living in the glorious reflection of his municipal greatness and In the
l\ memory of some of the local Commissioners who would not obey him and who were made to feel the weight of his
! I " displeasure, he has awakened to the astounding realization that he overstepped the bounds and has been turned
. * down.
More than that, the trick has been done by a common, ordinary, everyday policeman. In all the assertion of
" his local majesty Mayor Phelan demanded the right to enter the Chinatown quarantine lines on Friday night. He was
' stopped at the ropes.
', "You can't come In here," shouted Officer J. Attridge, warningly. "We have positive orders to allow no one to
. pass the lines."
"But don't you know who I am?" said the Mayor, rising to his full dignity. "Don't you know who I am?"
"Yes. I know who you are; but that makes no difference. I'm here to obey orders."
His Honor pleaded that all he wanted to do was to go. to the detention tent in Portsmouth square and that really
' the tent was not in quarantine. Pleading and expostulation were of no avail. The police officer had received his orders
! and would not alter them or disobey them. And now his Honor the Mayor is divided between a scheme to be Inoculated
! or to expend his wrath upon the patrolman who failed to recognize under his Honor's silk hat that majesty which
makes him superior to the lawsâ even those of quarantine.
Mayor Phelan Seeks to Force the Quarantine.
The Board of Supervisors Bet its seal of
disapproval upon unsightly billboards and
advertising fences yesterday by passing
an ordinance limiting their height to ten
feet. The ordinance is intended to regu

before the vote was taken, but Branden

a. 10-foot and 20-foot fence. The vote on

The Board of Supervisors fixed the tax
rate for the next fiscal year at $1,137 on
every $100 of assessed valuation at yester
day's meeting, which lasted until after
midnight. The meeting was devoted al
most entirely to the consideration of the
budget as recommended by the Finance
Committee, which has been heretofore
published. The appropriations for the va
rious departments were taken up sepa
rately and discussions of a more or less
Interesting nature were had upon each
item. A number of reductions in the
original estimates were made, but the sav
ings thus effected were transferred to
other funds.
The rate of $1,137 allows $1 for the ex
penditures of the municipal government,
the rate of .137 being applied to raising
revenue fcr the park fund, interest ana
sinking fund, as provided by the charter,
and for the repayment of taxes paid' un
der protest on bonds held by the Sup'reme
Court'to be unassessable." The total sum
necessary to supply the needs of the city
for the next nscal year is $3,632,985. of
which *4,26S,titÂ» is to be raised by taxation
and $1,424,325 irom other sources.
The segregated expenditures and rate of
taxation necessary lor their provision fol

General fund, J3.927.0OO, rate .8760; school

Supervisor Reed made a strong effort
in tne interest or economy to reauce tnt?
salaries ot tne cierKs in me otnee or tne
Hoard of Supervisors from tlbw to $15uv.
.tie contenutci that *m per month was
sufficient pay for cierKs, and that if tne
boaru mtenuea to reauce municipal ex
penses it should commence in us own of
rtce. Uranaenstein agreed with Keeu and
staled that as clerks in other departments
received but \VÂ£>, that ngure snouid by
adopted. Uwyer and Curus opposed tha
reduction on the ground that me clerks
dunes were onerous and that they otten
worked overtime. Heed moved that two
clerks be paici *1SOU and live $15W, but
the motion was lost. Brandenstein moved
that the stationery clerks receive Jlooo,
instead of ?l.^'O per year. The motion
prevailed ana the economical streak re
sulted in a reduction to the enormous
extent of $300 per year, the supervisors
account being H2.00O. ' , .
The estimate of $900 for the clerks of
the Board of .Equalization was cut to $7uu.
but McCarthy's motion to cut the adver
tising from *2O,0tW to $15,000 was lost. In
view of the tact that the bids "for burial
of indigent dead showed a large reduction
that item was cut from $6000 to $o(XÂ»0.
On motion of Boxton the fund tor the
interment of deceased ex-Union soldiers
and sailors was reduced from $3uoo to
$1500 with instructions to the Hospital
and Health Committee to inquire into the
advisability of the appropriation. _
Brandenstein objected to allowing JbOOO
for printing municipal reports, but Tobin
explained that last year $S500 had been
expended for that purpose. The Item
was however, reduced to $5000.
The motion to cut the appropriation for
prisoners' subsistence from $4S, 000 to $46,
000 was opposed by Tobin, who said that
Sheriff Lackmann had lived within his
appropriation during the last six months
and had been very economical. Branden
stein held that subsistence had cost $16,-
OoO this year and should not cost any more
the next. The motion was lost and the
Sheriff will get J4S.000 to feed his pris-
Brandenstein objected to spending $1500
for a safe for the Assessor, saying that
he already â¢ had a vault in his office.
Tobin stated that the Assessor had not
been allowed any extra clerks and. was
placated by being allowed the safe. Ma
gulre said that the safe was necessary
because moneys were ' received by the
Assessor after the Treasurer's office was
closed. Heed suggested that the Treas
urer's ofilce be kept open until 5 p. m.,
as provided by the charter. The motion
to leave provision for the safe out of the
fund prevailed.
McCarthy suggested that a central sta
tion for the city, telephones be establish
ed so as to permit of a reduction. Reed
moved that the figure be reduced from
$12,000 to $6000. Brandenstein favored Ma
guire's amendment that the fund be fixed
at $7000, aa he thought the telephone mo
nopoly could be brought to time, and the
latter figure was adopted. '
Reed moved that the item of $94S0 for
158 hydrants in the water fund be stricken
out on the ground that it was simply a
gift from the city to the Spring \ alley
Water Works. He contended that in ilx
ing the water rates the company had
been allowed 5 per cent on its Invest
ment. Tobin said that* the corporation
would remove the hydrants If It were
not paid for them, and that It had allowed
them to remain with the understanding
that they would be paid for out of the
next tax levy. Curtis argued that the
hydrants were absolutely necessary, but
Connor held that the board could not
save $34S0 easier than by eliminating the
item entirely. Reed finally changed his
motion so that the sum be taken off
the total appropriation of $23S,0S0 with
out specifying any particular item, but
the motion was lost and the original
amount was allowed to stand.
Brandenstein opposed the item of $10,000
for the maintenance of minors in the
Magdalen Asylum, as he thought there
were sufficient public Institutions for the
purpose and that an additional - burden
should not be imposed on the city. Reed
held that the Inmates were supported for
a lower figure than were those of other
institutions and the amount was left un
disturbed. The ' Mayor suggested that a
committee be appointed, to investigate
the institutions of that class. The motion
to roduce the Item of $20,000 for mainte
nance of feeble-minded children to $15,000
was carried.
Reed objected to allowing the Auditor
four extra clerks included in the item
of preparing the assessment roll, and
Brandcnsteln's motion that: he be allow
ed but two extra clerks with a consequent
reduction of $2400 in â¢ the appropriation
was lost by- a tie vote.
Reed opposed ,the recommendation of
the Finance Committee that the Assessor
be not allowed $4500 for extra clerks. Reed
held that the money would be well placed
by bringing . larger returns of taxable
property. Assessor Dodge addressed the
board and stated that'while he had asked
for the extra clerks as a plain business
proposition, he .would withdraw his re
quest. Reed then moved that the clerks
be allowed, but the motion failed to get
a second and $4500 was sliced off the As
sessor's appropriation. '
.When the board reconvened in the even-
Inp. Reed wanted the appropriation of
$275,000 for public lighting cut to $250,000
Hotaling opposed the reduction, saying
that there .was an urgent demand on the
part of the people for well lighted streets.
Reed held that competition would soon
result in lower light rates. He figured
that competitive rates would save 533 000
and thus leave a surplus of $S00O. Rran
donstein contended that ,'sorae provision
should be made for future lights made
necessary by the growth of the city. 1 Gas
Inspector . Tupper thought that the public
lighting would cost only. $260,000 when the
competitive rates of 42Vs cents for electric
and 9 cents per night for. gas lamps would
rule.: Brandensteln's .motion that the
lighting appropriation be placed at $255 -
000, representing a cut of $20,000, was
adopted; .,.'Â¦â¢Â¦
