BLAKE ACCUSES BRITISH
OF INHUMAN TACTICS
DALLAS. Tex.. June 3.â General J. T. P.
Blake, commander of the Irish brigade In
the Boer army, was a Texas n cowboy in
'' early life and / was known as "Beau"
Blake. Alexander W. Robertson of Den
ton County received a letter from General
Blake to-day. In which the general says:
"This war is to destroy the liberty and
Independence of the Dutch and deprive
them of their gold fields to satisfy Rhodes.
Chamberlain and Milner. He that would
serve humanity best would have hanged
for their perfidy the above trio of political
rascals. The Dutch are too liberal, too
humane and too strict In their observance
of the rules sovernlne civilized warfare
to contend with the English, who abuse
the armistice, the Red Cross, the white
flag' and murder wounded captives with
the lance on the battlefield.
"The Irish brigade, which I have the
honor to command. Is composed of Irish
and Irish-Americans, and a braver and
more determined lot of men you will not
:ind anywhere. I was wounded in the right
arm below the elbow by-a shrapnel shell
on October 3> at the battle of-Modder
sprult. In front of Ladysmith, I never
left the batt".< field, although I was. laid
up for six wseks."
He was at once told to hand It over and
It seemed as acceptable to the bold bandit
as the shining gold pieces.
Excitement runs high in this locality
and should the highwayman be captured
he would probably meet with rough usage.
Some oT the bolder spirits openly assert
that a rope would be too good for tne
man and news from the Sheriff's pesse
is eagerly awaited.
The man made no attempt to disguise
his voice and any of his victims could
easily Identify him. His description tal
lies with that of the highwayman who
successfully held up one of the Yosemite
stages a few days ago.
There Is much speculation regarding his
moves after escaping from the cavalry
men, believe he has a lair in the
hills and Is concealed in the neighborhood
of the spot where the stage was held up.
The eagerness with which he accepted Joe
Footman's , box of food Is dwelt upon in
support of this theory- Others hold that
he had a horse concealed among the trees
and is successfully making his way to
one of the larger cities by a safe but cir
cuitous route and will mix freely with
other men until his funds are exhausted.
A minute description of the man has
been telegraphed to surrounding cities ana
the officers hope rather for his capture at
a railway station than In the hills.

An event which almost proved h!s un-

making his escape. While he was at-
from one of the stages he was surprised
by a number of cavalrymen. He at once
darted into the brush and the soldier.-s i
searched for him for several hours. He
made good his escape, however. andthÂ«
hoofs of twenty, horses plowed up in,
ground so thoroughly that It Is now im-
possible to find the trail. .
It is the common belief that the bandit t
had a number of accomplices waiting in '
the brush or he would nor have gone Â¦
about his work in sucn a deliberate man-
ner. He walked freely among his vie- !
j tims and asked each man in turn If ho
I had any weapons. All this time his body
was an easy .target for any .man who

WASHINGTON. June 3.â So Important
are the lessons taught by the Boer war
that Secretary Root has given instructions
that reports of the American army offi
cers who have^Eeen sharply watching the
South African military operations be
published in pamphlet form for the bene
fit of the service. Tactical reports from

in the Philippines will also be called .to
the attention of officers of the army-
Captain Stephen L. H. Slocnm. Eighth

and Captain Karl Reichman. with the
Boer forces, do not hesitate In their re
ports to criticize the commanders of the
opposing forces. The criticism passed by
Lord Roberts upon Generals Muller.
Methuen and Gatacre are repeated by
Captain Slocum.
Captain Reichman's reports are gener
ally highly flattering to the Boers,
speaking of their splendid mobility and In
general of their defensive tactics, though
citing that their failure to take the of
fensive has frequently lost them valuable
advantage.
Officers of the army who have been
closely following- the war say that while
the lessons taught cannot be regarded as
especially new, the operations have sub

w~Â»uld continue the war to the extent of
waging a guerrilla conflict:
"What else can they do? They can get

Even If the situation is impossible In a

MOUNTAIN WARFARE
THE. ONLY ALTERNATIVE
LONDON. June 4â The Daily Telegraph
has the following from Senekal. dated
May 20:
"General Rundle's action Monday and
yesterday entirely secured the object for
wh'eh it was undertaken. The Boers have
novr, withdrawn from _ind!ey and Colonel
Spriggs has been able to extricate the
Duke of Cambridge's Yeomanry from
their difficulties."
The Daily News has the following from
Senekal dated May 29:
"The scene during the battle was won
derfully picturesque, rolling billows of
smoke, higher than the highest kopje,
obscuring the combatants. The roar of
artillery and the crackle of musketry un
der the light of the flames of the burning
veldt combined to produce a picture of
appalling grandeur, but terrible for those
engaged within its field.
â¢To-night the surroundings of the Boer
position are blackened and waste. We ex
pect the enemy to vacate the hills before
morning and to retire. Their desperate
efforts during the day were directed to
getting a force to the kopje which General
Rundle threatened last night and to-day
in order to enable Colonel Spriggs to ex
tricate the Duke of Cambridge's Yeo
manry.
"The whole army of Free Staters Is
now between Senekal. Lindley and Ficks
burg. It is reported to be composed
chiefly, of desperate men, who would not
go to the"Transvaarto:fight and* who are
too proud to surrender. Their total num
ber is believed to be from 3000 to 4000."

Lloyd led in the face of a deadly fire. He
was shot, but struggled on, only to be
disabled by another bullet. Lieutenant
Murray in falling cried, "Forward Grena

The blinding smoke of the veldt ham
pered the operations.
Lieutenant Seymour, on oTfering to go
back to direct the artillery, was wounded.
T*ie order to retire was piven and exe
cuted under a screen of smoke. The Boer
fire was kept up until dusk.
According to a dispatch to the Daily
Telegraph from Newcastle, dated Satur
day, the Boers exhibit no signs of leaving j
Laings Nek.
Newspaper commentators here generally
regard the situation at Pretoria as enig
j matical. They rather expect news of the
British occupation to-day. An odd conse
quence of the impending extinction of the
Transvaal is that its coinage is at an enor
mous premium In -Cape Town, pennies
bringing ten shilling*.

"Everywhere I met the most shocking and revolting scenes. The famlna

in all directions and stricken In Right, were found dying in the fields and roadside
ditches. The numbers at one relief station were increasing at the rate of 13.000
per day.
"At Godhera there were 3000 deaths from cholera within four days, and at
Dohad 2600 in the same period. The hospital death rate at Godhera and Dohad
was 90 per cent- Air and water were Impregnated with an Intolerable stench of

"At Ahmedabad the death rate In the hospital was 10 per cent. Every day

hovered around the patients.
"I visited the smallpox and cholera wards at Virasram. All the patients
were lying ton the ground, there being no cots. Otherwise, their condition was
fair.
"I can fully verify the reports that vultures, dogs and jackals are devour

"The government Is doing Its best, but the native officials are hopelesslv and

sity Graduates.
NHV>' YORK. June 3.â In his bacca
laureate sermon before the members of
the graduating class of the New York
University to-day Chancellor MeCracken
commented upon the movements for re
vision of the Presbyterian creed.
"Compulsory itinerancy," said he, "has
been adjudged no longer the strong and
desirable pillar of truth. She quietly put
It aside. Presbyterianlsm in like manner
has this same year shown new vitality in
refusinp to consider her ancient creed
that attempts to establish a definite
chronology of the workings of the divine
intellect, while it forgets almost entirely
to mention the divine heart. Such a creed
is not the best possible pillar or support
of religious truth.
"The church to-day is resolved to build
a new piliar and support that shall stand
Fide by Fide with the old. To build a new
pillar is both easier and better than to try
to piece out the old â than "to put new cloth
into an old garment."

RECOGNITION
FOR PIONEER
REPUBLICANS
PORTLAND, June 3. â The campaign in
Oregon closed last night 'and the party
managers have been busy to-day in per
fecting 1 arrangements for the election
which occurs to-morrow. There will be
elected oneJustlce of the Supreme Court,
a State Dairy and Food Commissioner,
two Congressmen, members of the Legis
lature, who 1 will choqpe a successor *.o
George W. McBride in the United State-*
Senate, and various district and county
officers. No unusual interest has been de
veloped In the campaign. There are three
tickets in the field, the Republican, the
fusionlst (composed of Democrats, Popu
lists and I<'ree Silver Republicans) and
the Prohibition. The Republicans have
made expansion a leading issue and have
put forth the claim that the country is
enjoying unusual prosperity owing to the
enactment of a law by Congress fixing
gold. as the standard of value. The Chi
cago platform of 1806, anti-imperialism
and the course of the national administra
tion on the Porto Rlcan question have
served as a basis of fusion argument.
' Chairman- R.-S. Sheridan of the Demo
cratic State Committee-has given out the
followingr \".t- - '- Â¦ Â¦ -
"It is hard to tell what the result will
.he. We are not .making any claims as
to the majorities we think our candidates
will receive. The issues have been placed
before the people and we will be satisfied
with their verdict, whatever it may be.
We have full faith and confidence in tr-<<
intelligence of the voters of this State and
believe their verdict will be rendered in
our favor on Monday. We think the ma
jority of people in Oregon are opposed to
the legislative course of the present ad
ministration^ and will' not indorse its
course on"= the Port* Rlcan question, th*
.trusts and the tendency toward Imperial
ism. We think the majority of the people
of this State believe that . Congressmen
Tongue and Moody cannot be re-elected
on the stand taken by them on the Porto
Rlcan question, and we confidently be
lieve that Daly and Smith, fusion candi
dates, will be elected to Congress from
this State." : .
Chatrman George A. Steel of the Repub

Explosion Shatters Cable Conduit and
Switches at an Intersection
on the Olive-Street
Railway.
ST. LOUIS, June 3.â A riot of small pro
portions, during which a boy was fatally
shot and a dynamite explosion occurred,
marred what otherwise would have been
an uneventful Sabbath. As a car on the
Tower Grove line was passing the corner
of Twelfth and Calhcun streets, a crowd
of strike sympathizers threw rocks at it.
An unknown man in the car fired a revol
ver into the crowd. The bullet struck Pe
ter Frank, a sixteen-year-old boy, who
was sitting in the doorway of his father's
house. A detachment of police dispersed
the rioters., The boy will die.
At a late hour this afternoon an explo
sion of dynamite shattered the cable con
duit and switches in the- Olive-street line
at the intersection of Maryland and Boyle
avenues. No one was injured, but traffic
on that end of the line had to be suspend
ed. There is no clew to the perpetrators.
More than the usual quota of police was
furnished to-day for the protection of pas
sengers and crews, and as a result the
number of cars on the various line* of the
Transit Company was materially in
creased. Cars were operated on sixteen
lines.
This morning the nucleus of the first
regiment of special deputies forming Sher
iff Pohlmann's posse comitatus, consist
ing of ten companies of sixty men each,
armed with shotguns, were assigned to j
service In preserving order. Their duties
consisted of patrolling the streets and do
ing guard duty at the various power
houses and car sheds.
The work of subpenalng citizens con
tinued uninterruptedly to-day. Sheriff
Pohlmann had intended to lS9ue subpe
nas for the members of the First Regi
ment, National Guard of Missouri, as in
dividuals, not as an organization, but the
Officials changed their minds, and to-day
it was announced that the soldier boys j
would not be sworn in.
Defenseless Women Attacked.
Street car strike sympathizers this even
ing vented their wrath upon two defence
less young women, tearing their clothes
and otherwise maltreating them because
they had ridden on street cars. Christine
Thlere, 18 years of age, a servant, was al
tacked by a crowd of 2000 men and boys
when she alighted from a Geyer-avenuo
car at 5 p. m. A young man called her a
"scab," and others Joined in the chorus.
Another young man tore off her Jacket
and another her hat. She was struck
by the fists of men and bruised about the
face and body. A pocketbook was
snatched from her hands and the money
taken. Piece by piece her clothing was
torn away while she appealed for entrance
at the nearest house. The occupants,
however, were afraid the mob would tear
down the building and refused her ad
mission. She succeeded in reaching nn
alley and ran down it, followed by the
hooting men. There was a little window
leading into a cellar. She broke the
glass and jumped In and cowered In a
corner in the darkness. Finally her per
secutors went away. Then she called for
help and received it, finally being taken
home.
At 1916 South Twelfth street Stella Brod
erlck got off a car, only to be assailed and
hooted at by a mob. Her jacket was torn
from her by men. She ran down an alley
and into . the home of Mrs. Folk. The
mob surrounded the house and began
throwing stones through the windows.
Mrs. Folk got a revolver and opened fire
on the mob from. her front window and
the men scattered.

BULLETS AND
DYNAMITE ON
THE SABBATH
WASHINGTON, jun.3 3.-The record of
the lirst session of the 1'ifty-sixth Con-
Sress Is now practically closed and It is
possible to survey the important work it
has accomplished durir.s the last six
months. It has been a busy Congressâ
the busiest, according to veteran otllclaJs,
in many years. In some respects the work
has been less exciting than that of the
preceding Congress, which covered the
dramatic period T\hen war was declared
against Spain, and also the period ot re
construction and treaty-ma-klng with
Spain, following the successful close of
the war. Hut in work actually accom
plished, and started toward accomplish
ment, the record of the present session
stands well In comparison with the most
energetic Congress.
Our new territorial pcsses.sions have re
ceived much attention, and, while there
has been no detinite action as ta the Phil
ippines or Cuba, a foim of government
and a means of raising revenue have been
provided fur Potto Rico and a compre
hensive territoriaJ form ci government
has been given to Hawaii. The financial
act has made Important changed In the
laws relating to me parity of metals, the
bonded indebtedness, national banks and
the security of the Treasury by a gold re

of the Senate, ready for action when Con

.sNjilarly advanced. The anti-trust con
stitutional amendment has a defeat re
corded against it. The Pacific cable meas
ure has passed the Senate and is awaiting

Some Exciting Incidents.
The exclusion of Brigham H. Roberts
from a seat fn the House because of his
polygamous sentiments, the refusal of the
Senate to admit Mr. Quay on the appoint
irent of the Governor of .Pennsylvania.
and the sentationai charges, investigation
and developments in the Senate In the
case of Mr. Clark of Montana, have added
some exciting phases to the Senate.' In
vestigations nave been prolific, including
the Inquiry Into the Coeur d'Alene mining
riots In Idaho, the vaiious inquiries on
polygamy growing out of the Roberts
case, and, more recently, the Senate in
vestigation of the poiial and other irreg
ularities in Cuba.
The total of appropriations cannot vet

lor the session.
The Senate in executive session has bÂ»en
occupied to a considerable extent with im
portant treaties. Of the.se the treaties
with Great Britain and Germany closing
the tripartite government in Samoa and
awarding to th< United States the island
of Tutuila with its valuable harbor of
Pago Pago has been ratiried. while the
commercial leciprocity treaties with
France and the .British West Indian isl
ands and the Hay-Pauncefote treaty con
cerning the ir.uroceanic canal go over
without action.
Financial Legislation. â
Of the legislation actually accomplished
end now on the statute books the financial
aÂ«t is regarded as the chief achievement
of the year. The noteworthy feature of
the d< bate on this measure in the House
Â»is thai party lines were broken to some
extent, ii number of Democratic members
Irom the Kastern and New England States
joining with the majority in passing it.
In the Senate also party lines were not
entirely regarded. Senators Lindsey and
Offery voting for the measure and
Chandler against It. As it became a law
by the 1'resldetit'n signature on March 14,
It makes specific the declaration of the
gold standard, ;rovides a treasury reserve
of $O>j0.<i0<j. establishes a division of is
pue and redemption of the treasury, pro
vides for the redemption and reissue of
Interest bearing bonds of the United
States and makes new regulations as to
the national banks, their circulation es
timate in small communities and the tax
they pay. The act also contains a specific
declaration that its' provisions "are not
intended to preclude the accomplishment
of International bimetallism."
Porto Rico legislation has been the most
fruitful theme of controversy in and out
of Congress during the session. The dis
cussion first turned on the revenue bill
levying a duty of 15 per cent of the L)ing
ley" rates on Porto Rican goods. The ma
jority of the Ways and Means Committee
â¢urged the constitutionality and necessity
of this course, while the minority, rein
forced by MoCall of Massachusetts, a
member of the majority, maintained that
the constitution of the United States ex
tended to Porto Rico and that Congress
was inaugurating 1 a new and dangerous
precedent by giving the island any other
law than that of the rest of the country.
Strife "Within Parties.
Excitement ran high und'-r the 'spur of
tiidcipread public attention. The delate
In the House was signalized by the <!i\i
sion of the majority, which for a time
made the lesult doubtful, but the bill ulti
mately passed. The contest at times
animated but Jess acute, the Senate cha.v?-
Inj? the entire scepe of the measure ty
adding a complete form of civil govern
ment. Jn this form, raising revenue and
*Â»*ta!.lishing an island government, the
measure became a law. Subsequently It
was amended so as to limit corporate
franchises, and on the President's recom
gendatlon an act was passed appointing
r the use of Porto Hlco the g2jp9M5a col
lected from island sources since its acqui.
S XCc'it in importance in the accomplished
trork of the session is the act "to provide
a roverr.ment for lh.> Territory of Ha
waii " The debate? on It in the Senate
and House aroused little division, save on
matters of detail. The act provides a sys
tem of government much like that of the
Territories with a Governor appointed by
the President, u legislature of two
houses, franchise rights practically the
Famo as those of voters In the United
F'ates with the additional qualification
That a voter shall * # be able to ppeak, read
and write the English or the Hawaiian
language."

Philippine Problem Not Solved. ]
The Philippines and Cuba have occupied J
much attention In the way of debate and
the adoption of resolutions of inquiry.
The Ppr.oner bill, providing that when all
Insurrection atrainst tnÂ«Â» authority of the
tTnited States j-hall bo at an end all mili
tary, civil and judicial powers, until
otherwise provided by Congress, shall be
carried on under the direction of the l'res- j
ldÂ»Â»nt, formed the ba^ls of the Senatorial j
donate on the Philippines' but was fruit- j
leÂ»s of action. The only I^trisiation as to
Cuba Is of a comparatively minor char
acter, relating to Cuban shipiiing.
The extradition bill, applying to all Jn
sulur possessions and dependencies, has
passed bota houses, and doubtless will i
become a law. It Is tii.-slgned mainly to
reach cases like that of Charles F." W.
Neely.
Th^ Nicnraeuan canal bill and the shlp
p!nK subsidy bill axe notable Instances of
iejrislaUon partly advanced during the
present session, but not enacted into law.
The canal bill has passÂ«Â»d the House and
has been made the special order in the
Eenate. beginning December 10 next. The |
bill is on the calendar of each
house, \r!th a favorable recommendation
from a majority of the members of the
Senate ar.d House committees.
Anti-trust legislation has come promi-
Tienily into attention in the House at the
olosp of th<* session. th*Â» House having
passed a new anti-trust bill and defeated
a constitutional ameDdmrnt. The Senate
has passed a. bill for a cabte to the Phil
ippines and beyond, to be constructed and
maintained under the Government. !>ut no
action has bÂ«.*en taken on it In the House.
The restriction of oleomargarine has
been productive of considerable agitation,
mainly in committees, and a radical re
strictive bill has been reported to the
House.
The only two items of difference which
might cause material delay are the armor
plate amendment on the naval appropria
tion bill and the amendment on the sun
dry civil bill in the interest of the St.
Louis exposition. The leaders of all
parties apparently are united in the wish
to bring the session to a close on Wednes
day, and by beginning the dally sittinRs
f-arly and allowing them to continue late
they will succeed.
Conference reports on appropriation and
other bills promise to occupy the attention
of the House to the exclusion of every
thing during the closing days of the
session. Only one piece or general legis
lation seriously threatens the programme
âthe Grout oleomargarine bill. The
friends of this measure have been very
insistent and have threatened in case the
Senate does not agree to the resolution
for final adjournment on Wednesday to
hold up any amended resolution until
they can have an opportunity to vote on
their bill. A way out of the difficulty
was suggested yesterday which may be
put into operation to-morrow. To-morrow
bÂ«inK suspension day. Mr. Tawney may
be recognized to move that an hour of
Tuesday hf given to the oleomargarine
bill. As this motion will require a two
thirds vote the powers that be are willing
that the measure be considered if it can
command such an overwhelming majority
of the House.
There is now hardly any doubt that the
Senate will agree to the House resolution
to adjourn the session next Wednesday.
The passage of the last ot the appropria
tion biils leaves no obstacles in the way
of final adjournment except the amend
ments made to those bills by the Senate,
and the opinion is now general that these

This Week's Programme.
Considerable general legislation is car
ried in appropriations. These provisions
include the amendments to the Military
Academy bill, making the commanding
general of the array a lieutenant general
anJ the adjutant general of the army a
i^i.ijor general; also the amendment to the
sundry civil bill appropriating $5,000,000 for
the Si Louis exposition. Both of tnese
bills are still ponding. The naval appro
priation bill adds two battleships, three
armored cruisers, three protected cruiser*
Jir.d live submarine boats to the naval
strength and may include special legisla
tion as to armor plate and a Jovcrnmcrt
plant. The other appropriation bills in ;he
main carry the usual Government sup
plies.
The Alaska code bill, giving a complete
civil system of the laws to the Territory,
has passed both houses, and undoubtedly
will become a law. Other measures whicn
have passed one house or the other but
are still pending include those for the
election of Senators by the people, au
thorizing the Pi^cdent to appoint a com
mission to stuuy commercial conditions
in China and Japan, for increasing the ef
ficiency of the army by making service
in the staff corps temporary, extending
the eight-hour law. Inert-using the annual
allowance to the militia of the country
from J-JUO.OOO to 51,000,000.
General Legislation.
Another measure passed of some gen
eral interest permits the Secretary of Ag
riculture to restore game birds which are
becoming extinct, and provides means for
the restriction of traffic in dead animals,
birds, etc.. from State to State, the lat
ter provision being in part designed to
l'mit the destruction of song birds for
the sale at their plumage.
Among other miscellaneous acts of the
Session are those for the preservation of
the historic frigate Constitution and for
extending the work of the twelfth census.
The Free limnes Act has at last become
a law. It provides for the patenting of
homesteads In the public lands acquired
from thÂ« Indians on tne oayment of the
usual fees and no further eiturges. Tnls
opens to free homestead entry many mill
ions of acres of public lands in the West

SAX RAFAEL, June 3.â There is con
siderable feeling in local Democratic po
litical circles over the election yesterday
of Adolph Sylva as a delegate to the com
ing State convetnion. It is reported that
several delegates will refuse to attend the
convention on that account. The delegates
were elected by the representatives of the
several Supervisorial districts, and under
the arrangement Sylva was elected.
Many prominent Democrats were op
posed to his election, but it seems that all
waited for some one else to take the
Initiative, with the result that there was
no opposition to the man from Sausalito.
Most of the local Democrats are now ex
plaining that they had nothing to do with
the election and that the odium rests on
the Sausalito delegation.

FOR THE ELKS
Plans Announced by the
Advisory Council of the
Civic Federation.
Interesting to All.
Will Provide a National Forum,
Where Non-Partisan Ideas Will
Be Exchanged on Problems
CHIOAGO, June 3.â The organization of
the advisory council of the National Civic
Federation was completed and announced
to-day. The Iccal organization has pro
moted four national conferences on the
subjects, respectively, of industrial arbi
tration, municipal reform, policy of the
United States and combinations and
trusts. After the conference on- trust*
last September it was decided that its na
tional work could be more effectively car
ried on through a national body, and to
perfect such an organization appointed a
committee, with Franklin H. Head as
chairman and R. M. Easley as secretary.
The prospectus of the organization
states its object to be:
To provide for the study and discussion
of questions of national import, affecting
either the foreign or domestic policy of
the United States; to aid in*-*he crysta*-i
zation of the most enlightened public sen
timent of the country in respect thereto,
and, when desirable, to promote neces
sary legislation in accordance therewith.
The plan provides for an executive com
mittee of thirty, an advisory council of
5C0 and a large membership throughout
the country, composed of representative,
practical men of affairs, irrespective of
party or creed.
The by-laws provide for standing com
mittees on the following subjects: For
eign relations, insular affairs, banking and
currencv. industrial combinations, inter
state and foreign commerce, consular and
diplomatic service, -labor, municipal gov
ernment, taxation, civic service, Indian
affairs and the negro question.
Franklin H. Head, chairman of the com
mittee on organization, in announcing the
advisory- council, said:
"The object of the National Civic Fed
eration, in addition to creating depart
ments to study national problems, will be
to provide a national forum by means of
which the representatives of all these
great divisions of society may come to
gether and discuss the problems in which
all have a common interest. . There are
many such to-day outside of political
questions, the solution of which such a
body may assist in in an educational way.
The meeting will be helil annually, or as
often as conditions suggest, and in differ
ent localities. The* organization will be
absolutely non-partisan. That there is a
field for such an organization is evidenced
bv the 500 acceptances received on tbe ad
visory' council and the hearty indorsement
of the plan contained therein."
The date of the first meeting, and the
subjects for discussion will be decided by
the executive committee and announced
Among those who have accepted mem
bership on the advisory council are presi
dents of the leading schools of learning of
the country. prominent ministers, etc.. and
men high up in the commercial world.
They include ' the following: Robert

cial features have been arranged and
these, in addition to the many natural at
tractions and advantages offered by At
lantic City, will afford each and" all. a
most delightful visit to the seashore.
Atlantic City Lodge has not been mak
ing much noise over its preparations for
the reunion, but it assures all visitors that
when they arrive here they will be hospit
ably received and that everything neces
sary for their comfort and entertainment
has been provided for in ample manner.
The second annual exhibition of the At
lantic City Horse Show Association will
be held here during the week the Elks'
convention is in session, and as this is
one of the greatest social functions at
the resort, as well as one of the foremost
equine exhibitions in the country, it will
be greatly enjoyed by the visitors. The
bathing, sailing, fishing, golfing, wheeling,
driving and scores of other amusement3
and diversions of all sorts at this place
are not surpassed anywhere in the coun
try and there will be plenty of entertain
ment to satisfy every one and send them
home firm friends of the queen resort ol
America.
The parade of Elk3 will take place on
the afternoon of Wednesday. July 11.
This parade is one of the leading features
of the Elks' renunion. Samuel E. Perry,
chairman of the parade and prize commit
tee, has charge of the detaiK of the pa
geant. This committee offers valuable
prizes in addition to a number of indi
vidual trophies.
FAIR CANDIDATES FOR QUEEN <
OF THE STREET FAIR
Spe<rial Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, June 3.â In connection,
with the Stockton Free Street Fair
and Fourth of July celebration. Ma
jor Sherman, secretary of tbe Ma-
sonic Veteran Association of the Pa
cific Ccast and a Mexican war veteran,
has suggested a very appropriate idea for
the coming celebration.
Major Sherman's idea is that the surplus
fund of the street fair or i) portion of It
should be utilized in building a statue of
Commodore Richard Stockton, to be
placed in one of the public parks or the
Courthouse Square.
Trie attraction o>mmit*.eÂ« has decided
to have a large painting of Commodore
Stockton made, with an appropriate bÂ«ar
CÂ«g and national flag emblems surround
ing it, to be placed at the tack of the
grand stand.
It is also suggested that there be a, sale
at Mare Island Navy Yard of old pieces
of ordnance, among which are several
used by Cornmodcre Stockton on this
coast. . Major Sherman pays that there
are three 32-pounders of old style, and
they can be rired in salutes just fifty
years after they were used against the
enemy on this coast. This matter has
been taken up by President Henderson,
and the Secretary cf the Navy has been
telegraphed to for the use of the guns.
Tbe committee has also decided to ex
tend an invitation to Rev. A. A. McAllis
ter, chaplain of the United States navy
at Mare Island, to be one of the military
chaplains present on July 4. He was chap-
Iain at the raising of the American flag
at Honolulu, when the Hawaiian Islands
were annexed to the United States.
Balloting for the queen has already be
gun. There is a great deal of interest
surrourding this contest.

Anxiety of the Filipinos.
While in Hongkong the Commissioners
questioned Armache and members of the
wealthy Cortez family regarding Filipino
affairs not covered by the Filipino Junta,
th^re. The Filipinos in Manila are anx
iously and even nervously waiting for a
formal statement by the commission re
garding its future policy. Everything the
Commissioners say or do is carefully con
sidered. Cables from Hongkong have
been published here to the eftect that the
commission will not assume control un
til Sept-mber. This repjort, coupled with
the statement that Washington approves
General MacArthur's plan of campaign,
has created considerable excitement in
Filipino circles, where it has been expect
ed that immediate changes of policy and
action would follow the arrival cf the
commission.
It should be understood that the fore
going declaration of Judge Taft is in no
sense intended as a proclamation.
ALMOST CERTAIN THEY
WOUNDED AGUINALDO
Details cf the Encounter of Major
March's Men "With the Chief
tain's Party.
VIGAN, Luzon. June 2 (via Manila. June
3 (.âMajor March, with his detachment of
the Thirty-third Regiment, overtook what
is believed to have been Aguinaldo's par
ty on Msy 19 at Lagat, about 100 miles
northeast of Vigan. The Americans kill
ed or wounded an officer supposed to be
Aguinaldo. whose body was remo%'ed by
his followers. Aguinaldo had -100 men.
Major March 123.
The American commander reached La
Boagan. where Aguinaldo had, made his
! headquarters since March 6. on May 7.
Aguinaldo had fled seven hours before,
leax-ing all the beaten trails and traveling
tnrougn the forest along the beds or
streams. Toward evening on Mav 1Â»
Major March struck Aguinaldo'S outpost
about a mile outside oÂ£ Lagat, killing rour
tiiipincs and capturing two. From the
latter he learned that Aguinaldo had
camped there for the night. Although ex
hausted and half starved. Major March's
men entered Lagat on the run. They saw
the insurgents scattering into the bushe3
or over the plateau. A thousand yards
beyond the town, on the mountainside,
the ilgures of twenty-live Filipinos,
cressed in white with their leader on a
gray hcrse. were silhouetted against the
sunset. The Americans fired a volley and
saw the cfScer drop from his horse. His
followers ft>d. carrying the body.
The Americans, on reaching the spot,
caught the horse, which was richly sad
dled. Blood from a badly wounded man
was on the animal and on the ground. The
saddlebags contained Acuinaldo's diary
and some private papers, including procla
mations. One of these was addressed:
"To the Civilized Nations." It protested
agair.st the American occupation of the
Philippines. There were also found cop
ies of Senator Beveridge's speech, trans
lated into Spanish and entitled: "The
Lx?athkne!l of the Filipino People."
Major March, believing that the Fil
ipinos had made for a river which is
tributary to the Chico, followed it for two
days, reaching Tiao. where he learned
that a party of Filipinos had descended
the river on ,May ?) on a raft with the
body of a deatl or Â¦wounded man upon a
litter, covered with palm leaves.
There Major March reviewed his com
mand, shoeless and exhausted, and picked
out twenty-four of the freshest men. with
whom he beat the surrounding country for
six days longer, but without finding any
trace of the insurgents. The Americans
pushed on and arrived at Aparri on May
25.
The officer shot was either Aguinaldo or
his adjutant, and as the horse was richly
caparisontd it is a fair presumption that
it was Aguinaldo.
The soldiers of General Young, military

Major March with signal fires. On reach

Aguinaldo's handwriting, the ink of which
was hardlv dry. addressed to an officer of
guerrillas of the Filipino army, and say

The Examiner has again stolen the important news
of the plague situation for which The Call is paying.
The public, however, has reason for congratulation,
and The Call is grateful that news of such vital im

F. Shrady i? given some added circulation even by
the local journalistic purveyor of stolen goods.
An investigator into matters of trade has discovered
that the millions of buttons, flags and patriotic pic

Mafeking were made in the United States, and now
the British manufacturers arc almost sorry there was
any occasion for rejoicing.
The efforts of the "Boxers" in China to exclude

IN the report of the California Deb'ris Commission
on the subject of impounding mining debris in the
. Yuba River, it is stated:
"Especial attention is invited to the fact that the ob
ject sought to be accomplished is the storage of the
debris now in the Yuba and its tributaries with a view
to the improvement of the rivers below and decidedly
not with a view of permitting unlicensed or indiscrim
inate hydraulic mining at localities above the im
pounding works. When the works have been com
pleted and in operation several years there will be time
and opportunity to determine whether or not the sys
tem is capable of sufficient expansion to warrant an
attempt at storing therein the tailings from the hy
draulic mines without compelling each mine to im
pound any or all of its debris. The commission
believes the project practicable and worthy of adop
tion, and so recommends. It is the only one thus far
evolved which gives reasonable hope of success and
at a very moderate cost for storage."
Commenting upon the report Attorney General
Ford is quoted as saying:
"It will be several years before it will be definitely
known how much of asuccess the works on the Yuba
River, will be. The first effect will be to determine
whether they are capable of storing the debris now in
the Yuba and its tributaries. If they are not a suc-

Political experts estimate that the only danger to
the Republican party this year is that the Democrats
may carry the House, and therefore no chances
should be taken in the Congressional districts. The
warning should be heeded in California, and every
effort made to send a solid prosperity delegation to
support the administration.
The report that London is to have a drama repre
senting the siege of Mafeking is another illustration
of the tendency of the stage to keep up with the
press. Everything that is new, from a novel to a
war, has to be played up to keep the public interested.

The Germ&nia shipyard at Kiel Is one of
the branches of the Krupp establishment
and employed 2726 men at last account.
It has only been in existence about four
years.

as well as those for foreign governments,
are tested there for endurance and ac
curacy.
Germany has adopted the Russian mast
for its battleships. It carries its fighting
tops quite low, thus escaping the smoke
from the funnels, insures greater ac

A floating dock for Hamilton, Bermuda,

be 545 feet In length. 100 feet wide, and
carry 33 feet of water over tho blocks.
The contract price is JD25,000 and guaran

the dock may be towed out to Hamilton

Good progress is being made at the new

The Brazilian torpedo cruiser Tamoyo.

23 feet 10 inches beam, and displaces 10S0
tons on a mean draught of 9 feet 10 Inches.
Her battery consists of two 3.9-Inch, six
6-pounders and two 1%-pounders. She has
also three under-water torpedo tubes. The
coal capacity is 260 tons, sufficient for 6000
knots at a 10-knot speed.
The waste of time and money through
the red-tape system which exists more or
less in all naval administrations is Illus
trated by the fact that the Japanese bat

NEWS OF NAVIES.
CROKER AGAINST HILL.
WHEN the Democratic State Committee of New
York met about a month ago to arrange for the
State convention of the party, Croker of Tam
many was in England and David Bennett Hill went
down to the meeting and captured the machine. Such
at least was the report that came from New York at
the time. Hill outlined a programme for the Democ
racy of New York to pursue in the National Conven
tion, and the State Committee indorsed it. Tammany
was apparently incapable of making head against the
sage of Wilfert's Roost, and when the committee ad
journed every paper in New York city declared, "Hill
is in the saddle."
Since that time Hill has been busy fixing his wires
to the machine, so that when the State convention
met he would have only to touch a button to have the
machine do the rest. Up to within something like
a week ago everything was seemingly in his hands.
Then from Croker there went a message which
ordered the Tammany braves to prepare to fight.
Hill's programme included an indorsement of Bryan,
but not the election to the National Convention of a
delegation instructed to support him. Furthermore
the delegation was not to be committed to free silver,
but it was to go to the convention with freedom to
make such terms with the Bryanites as would enable
the New Yorkers to frame the platform in considera
tion of voting for the Bryanite candidate.
Croker's programme as outlined by John F. Carrol,
temporary leader of Trmmany, is quite different.
Carrol is quoted as having said recently:
"As far as I have been able to consult with the rep
resentative men of the organization they entirely ac
cord with my view of both the propriety and expe
diency of sending to the'National Convention a dele
gation instructed for William J.t Bryan as the Presi
dential candidate. It is safe to say that every delegate
from the organization will favor this programme, and
whatever influence I may possess will be exerted to
impress the desirability of its adoption upon the dele
gates from the other localities in the State."
The convention is to meet to-morrow, and the ex
pectation of a good fight is thrilling the blood of trie
braves. Hill has some advantage from the fact that
never in the history of the "State has" a New Yprk
delegation to a Democratic National Convention been
instructed for a particular candidate except when the
State had a candidate of its own for President. If Hill
can induce the convention to~ maintain the precedents
of the party the victory is his. Croker has to take the
aggressive arid carry the convention into the adoption
of a policy hitherto untried.
The'impression prevails in some quarters that Cro
ker will have an. easy triumph. It. is recalled that in
1898 Hill had the State Committee, with him as he has
now, but that when the convention met Tammany
nominated Van Wyck without trouble'and Hill had
to retire to Wolfert's Roost to sulk after acquiescing in
Croker's plans. It is believed the new contest will be
a repetition of the former one; that Hill will do all
he can until the convention meets and then will break
down and lack the courage to make a fight on the
floor. There are other folks; however, who hold to
the doctrine that things rarely happen twice in the
same way. They maintain that this time David Ben
nett, has .made ready for a contest to the -bitter endÂ»
and that he will go back to Wolfert's Roost with
Croker's scalp hanging to his bel*
PRICES STILL SETTLING.
PRICES continue to settle all along the line and
throughout the whole country, if sugar and sev
eral fruit staples be excepted. The brunt of the
decline is borne by manufactured products and their
raw staples, such as iron, cotton, wool, hides, leather,
boots and shoes, etc. In some lines there is still a
foir.t effort to sustain the feverish quotations of 1899,
but it is a hopeless task, and most branches of trade
have yielded to the inevitable and are accepting the
r.e.v situation with the best grace possible.
Aside from those merchants and manufacturers who
are caught with large stocks of high-priced goods the
decline is rather beneficial than otherwise, for it in
sures permanence in conditions. It means a steady
rather than a feverish trade. There are no signs at
present that quotations for the general run of goods
will sink below the profit point. Prices for many raw
products are still considerably above the normal for a
number of years, and can stand pruning. It is better
to have a good, fluent market at fixed profits than a
fluctuating one with breakers ahead. We are simply
getting back to a more stable basis, and when it is
reached the demand will again spring up, prices will
cease to decline and regular conditions once more
prevail. The country is to be congratulated that the
current liquidation has been attended with so little
friction.
Thus far this year the decline in staples has averaged
from 15 to 20 per cent. The lines most affected were
mentioned in the first paragraph. A favorable feature
of the situation, however, is that the falling off in the
country's bank clearings is not as pronounced as it
has been, the decrease last week being less than 3 per
cent, against over 18 per cent for the preceding week.
Commercial failures still show an increase over 1899,
but it is slight. The railroads continue to report a
large volume of business, in some cases even larger
than in 1899, which points to a good undertone in
general trade, in spite of the decline in quotations.
Wheat and its dependent grains have been weak of
late, with a slow but steady decline in the former.
The fruit trade of the State is opening well, and thus
far very satisfactory prices have been obtained for
most kinds.
Speculation is languid all over the country. Even
Wall street is more iistless than usual during the sum
mer, and the recent events in South Africa, presum
ably favorable to a revival in financial business all over
the world, have failed to elicit any material response
from this mart. The public arc still shy and indiffer
ent, and the professionals have the field exclusively to
themselves. The best demand is for sound, dividend
paying bond?, and these have sold well for some
months. Indeed, this demand has been so con
tinuous that it is said that supplies of these securities
zxe now smaller than for a number of years. The
investors of the country are evidently after steady
interest instead of quick returns or. stock markets.
THE direct cost to Great Britain of
the present war with the Boers up to
the end of March is some $320,000,000,
the cheapest in money in her history,
considering the number of men put in the
field and the distance to which they had
to be transported.
In the American war of Independence
Great Britain expended $605,000,000.
The wars with France, beginning in 1793
and lasting with but little intermission

wars to France was J230.000.000. In the
Crimean war Great Britain put 97i000 men
in the field and the cost to her was $345,

war up to date.
France sent 310.000 to the Crimean
war at a cost jof $495,000,000. Great Britain
lost 27.000 men from battle and disease
from 93,000 and Russia nearly half of the
SS0.000 which she mustered on the shores
of the Black Sea. The American Civil
war cost the Federal Government $3,700,
000,000 in money and 350,000 men, while the
loss In life to the Confederates was some
300,000 more.
According to a report recently Issued by
the Bureau of Ordnance at Washington
the'eost of the ammunition used in de
stroying the Spanish fleet In Manila Bay
was $45,000, while the destruction of Cer

.While Queen Victoria's long reign is ac
counted one of the most glorious and
peaceful in English history, it is a matter
of fact that throughout the whole sixty
three years since she ascended the throne
there has never been a time when her war
dogs have all been in the leash. The first
Afghan war was the event of her acces
sion to the throne, as the present Boer
war is probably of the close of her reign,
while twenty-eight other distinct wars,
ranging over every quarter of the globe.
Including the Crimean war, have filled up
the Interval.
With conflicts impending In China and
on the Afghan border Great Britain has
never been so well prepared before to
meet the situation. Her total force in
South Africa, now numbers more than
220,000 seasoned troops, three times as
many as she ever before put in a foreign
field at any time.
Interesting Figures Taken
From Recent Official
Reports
BRITISH WARS
AND THEIR COST
mANT shameful stories have coma
from the Philippines of soldiers
who have deserted the American
colors to accept commissions in
the Filipino army, but there ia no
record of the capture and formal execu
tion cf any of these traitors. Pos
sibly the average person thinks that th'a
condition of affairs is due to lack of dili
gence on the part of the American troops,
or that they are soft-hearted over the de
livery to the authorities of their former
comrades. Lieutenant C. A. Beale. recent
ly arrived here, who had command of the
scouts in General Lawton's flying bri
gade that swept the Island of Luzon last
December, finds a much better reason,
however, for the failure of the American
troops to capture these renegades. He In
timates that when traitors are caught
they are summarily executed by their
captors.
"When we were on that trip," he said,
"we frequently heard stories oi former
American soldiers who were leaders in
the insurgent army, and quite as often the
names of the traitors were mentioned. Tho
temptations to desert were always great,
for the insurcents were willing to mako
majors and colonels of our private sol
diers and gave them plenty of money and
authority. The insurgents who came into
our lines boasted of this, and It made our
boys so mad that it was difficult to keep
them in camp, so anxious were they to
hunt down the traitors.
"One nieht we were so close to the
enemy's trenches that we could hear their
conversation. The commanding officer
was an American, nnd we could hear his
orders, given in English in a load tonÂ©
of voice. More than that, the boys were
certain they could recognize the voica a3
that of a man who had disappeared from;
camp some time before and was supposed
to have been captured. Of course, they
were wild. A scattering fire
being kept up all along tho
line. When the voice of. tha
American was distinguished in the insur
gent trenches the firing on our side began
in volleys, and they were directed at
whatever place the voice was heard
Every man In the line was trying to hit
that traitor. I think he became aware
that he was a target, for sometimes, after
a volley, he would laugh loiw and loudly.
Toward morning we heard no more of
him, and I do not know whether he was
hit or simply retired for the night It
was with difficulty that I kept the boys
from storming the insurgent trenches.
"Although I have never witnessed such'
a sight, I have frequently heard that
when an American was cornered In tha
insurgent trenches he was shown no
quarter. I never heard of that kind of a
prisoner. It is n.y belief that the boys
always considered that when a traitor
was caught red-handed It was their duty
to punish him without waiting for thq
formality of a court-martial."

THE FENCE ADVERTISING NUISANCE.
WHEN the Supervisors to-day resume consider
ation of the ordinance fixing the limit of height
to be permitted to fences used for advertising
purposes they will doubtless bear clearly in mind the
protests and the arguments which have been repeat
edly urged before the board and before the commit
tee having the matter in charge against permitting
such fences to exceed ten feet in height. That being
so it is reasonable to assume action will be no longer
postponed, but that the issue will be settled as the
majority of the people desire and as public interests
demand.
It is known that fence advertising has been carried
to the extent of a public nuisance all over the United
States, and that in all thickly settled localities it has
been found necessary to impose restrictions upon it.
In large cities, such as San Francisco, the nuisance
works an injury to the owners of property adjoining
the lots on which the high fences are erected, and
constitutes a menace to the bodies and to the lives of
those who in the transaction of their daily business
have to pass beneath them. It is therefore as a pro
tection to property and as a protection to person that
the public demands a restriction limiting advertising
fences to a height not exceeding ten feet in any patt
of the city; and it may be added they should not be
permitted at all upon crowded thoroughfares.
The advertising fence is one of the worst offenses
against the growing artistic taste and public spirit of
the American people. It is a survival of the
time when communities were indifferent to what sort
of appearance their thoroughfares presented. Since
the introduction of a finer order of street architecture
and the use of plate-glass windows permitting a dis
play along the streets of the most beautiful fabrics
and the costliest articles of luxury, there has arisen a
sense of revolt against a further toleration of those
glaring, flaring, coarse and gaudy posters which when
pasted upon walls and fences along the streets go
far to mar all the fine effect of the architecture and
the window decoration. Such unsightly and often
dirty objects should not be permitted upon our prin
cipal streets under any circumstances, and when tho
injury they inflict upon adjoining property and the
danger they impose upon the public are taken into
consideration, it becorries equally clear that even upon
the less crowded streets they should not be per
mitted to exceed a limit that reason sustains. Ten
feet in height affords ample space for such fences. No
more should be granted.

beloved dead rouses within him a fiend
that stops at nothing.
For ages the Chinese have followed a
funerary practice which has been helJ in
more reverent esteem than the pigt&il.
When a man dies his son dedicates to his
memory a tablet of wood upon which are
inscribed the words "Spirit Lcrd" and
"Spirit .Throne." After burial this taUct
is taken home, pet up in a specially pre
pared' place, and the eldest son, morning
and evening, for the mourning period of
three years, sets before it offerings to the
soul of the dead man. This custom is not
religious any more than is, the Christian
custom of strewing flowers on the graves
of the departed. It is only the peculiar
fashion in which the Chinese honor the
memory of their ancestors. And. strange ,
as It may seem, this custom has stood
between Christianity and the millions of
China for two centuries.
"When the early Catholic missionaries j
went to the Celestial kingdom they found I
its people apparently worshiping a slab of j
wood. Ready to listen to all suggestions j
from the missionaries in other matters,
the Chinese drew the line at. giving up
this particular act of homage to their |
dead. The soldiers of the cross were puz- j
zled. Uncertain as to whether or not the
tablet worship was idolatry, they ap
pealed to Rome and the judgment or the
Pope was adverse. To be a Christian the }
Chinese must give up the memorial tab-,

THE DECAY OF CHINA.
I T is little less than amusing to see the reasons rc-
I cently given for a belief that China is in decline
j and decay. In the first place, it is said that the
Celestial empire is falling into pieces because the Chi
nese object to the presence of Americans and other
1 foreigners among them. Long columns of high wis
j dom on this text are being written and published in
the United States and Germany. To object to for
eigners of a different race, coming among them to
save their souls or do anything more or less material,
is regarded as a reason for the immediate partition of
China, or the occupancy of her territory by allies, who
! are allies only because they cannot trust each other.
But while in this country and in Germany the writers
j write of this sign of decay in China, we are casting
j r.bout for more rigid means to make good and enforce
j our own objection to the presence here of foreigners
i from China. If that be a sign of dqcay we have been
j decaying for the last twenty years. We have not only
I mildly forced China into treaties to exclude her people
I from this country but we have passed all sorts of laws,
local and Federal, to the same end. In vacation time,
when we have not been inventing and setting up legal
â¢ traps and tricks to keep out these objectionable for
} cigners. we have been killing them in California,
i Colorado and Wyoming, and in that way, by mob vio
â¢ lence, we have killed twenty Chinese foreigners to
i one white foreigner killed by mobs in China. It is
I laughable that, with all this so recent in our history,
and much of it current, contemporary and every-day
matter, we should be uttering wisdom on the decay of
i China as proved by the objection of that unenlight
ened people to the presence of foreigners!
The next reason given for the decay of China is the
I reported persecution of native Chinese for religion's
sake. It is even said that our Government has pro
\ tested against this because the victims are Christians.
; We beg to respectfully submit that our Government
I is not a protector of the Christian religion in any of
its forms. Indeed, ours is not a Christian government
at all. It is a secular government and not the pro
tector of any form of religion, Christian or otherwise.
We are seldom without some form of religious perse
cution at home. Not long ago a Jew Mayor of Savan
nah had to stand between Catholics and A. P. A.
Protestants to keep them from slitting each other's
throat. Within a year Mormon missionaries- have
been hunted out of several American States, glad to
escape the vengeance of their pursuers and in some
cases clad in neat-fitting but uncomfortable suits of
tar and feathers.
If China is occasionally spitting a native Christian
on a bamboo skewer, wh} r is that any more a sign of
her decay than our Mormon chasing is a sign of our
decay? A Christian is just as offensive to China as a
Mormon is to our orthodox Christian taste.
Professional hypocrisy is doing a large business in
the world at this time. One of its manifestations :s
this outbreak of holy horror about the internal condi
tion of China. In this country we exclude Chinese
and mob Mormons, and in German}' the weather has
not washed out the tracks of the Poles, expelled and
marched out by Bismarck as objectionable foreigners,
and yet we are astounded and pained to learn that
poor, old, broken China objects to foreigners and in
her decay indulges in religious persecution as a pas
time!
The Western world has made other mistakes about
China and Japan. The late Marquis Tseng, in com
menting on the opposition everywhere to Chinese as
objectionable foreigners, said: "China voluntarily
isolated herself and desired to remain isolated. She
did not force herself upon the West. But the Western
nations used force to open China to the world, with
out seeming to reflect that they also opened the
world to China."
A little more of the "look before you leap" states
manship would be a good thing. The United States
sent Commodore Perij' to open Japan to the world,
snd he did it. Japan is just now returning the favor
by considering that Commodore Perry's can-opener
worked both ways, and opened the United States to
Japan. We did not think of that forty years ago,
when we ordered Japan to open her door or we would
shoot a hole through it. But we are reminded of it
now, when we find it necessary to close our own door
to Japan. We were under the glamor of the great
trade we hoped to get from Japan, but it is now shown
to be probable that the invasion of this country bv
Japanese in large numbers will take from us in five
years more than all the profit on- our Japanese trade
from the beginning.
But not many here and in Europe seem to be im
pressed by the fact that China is actuated against for
eigners by exactly the same motives that impel the
Western nations to exclude Chinese and will soon
make them exclude Japanese also. It is self-preserva-"
tion, and a natural feeling that the different races
would better stay in the place where nature planted
them. But when we act upon that principle it is
statesmanship; when China does the same it is a sign
of decay!
cess, then of course hydrsulicking will not be resumed
there and will not be resumed at all until the success
or failure of the experiment which promises so well
has been demonstrated. The first benefits come to the
farmers. The California Miners' Association has ex
pended $1000 to assist in this matter. That is an indi
cation of our faith in the success of the plan. If fail
ure is the result about $1,000,000 of the people's money
will have been lost, but we do not believe that there
will be a failure. The capacity of the expansion of the
proposed settling basin to hold the lighter material is
practically unlimited."
It will be seen that the plan provides first for the
improvement' of the rivers and the protection of the
farmers of the river counties, and not until those in
terests have been assured can it be determined how
far hydraulic mining may be carried on above the
impounding dams. It is therefore gratifying to learn
the California Miners' Association has faith in th>
plan. It is to be hoped the faith will be justified by
the results obtained. "Unlicensed .or. indiscriminate.,
hydraulic mining" is of course, not to be expected^
nor is it desirable, but we may reasonably expect the
works to prove sufficiently efficacious to admit of con
siderable mining not permitted at present.

was to devise some means by which their

For' some time there have been petty

along the water front, until it has become
unsafe for a man to leave even the small
est article of value unprotected. A com
mittee had been appointed at a previous
meeting and It made its report Saturday
evenrng.- The report was that special
counsel had been engaged and that the
hoodlum element, which is not largo but
is very active, would-be run to earth and
prosecuted with a vigor unusual in the
police' courts. There is one particular
gangr known as the "North Beach JMattu,"
to which ,the -particular attention of the
prosecutors will be turned. The members
of . this -gang,- it Â¦ was ; announced to the
meeting, will take .: anything from a foot

Special Officer Carter has been retained
by the citizens to look up the members of
the gang. He submitted the names of
several : who needed the consideration of
the courts and there will be no time lost
in seeing that they, get it. Several of

Miss Marke was born near Cambria in

A unique episode in the political history
is the career of the American or Know-
Nothing party. It was a secret, oath
bound, nameless orderâ nameless even to
Its members until they had reached the
higher degrees In the lodge. Its nomina
tions were made by conventions of dele
cates from various lodges, secretly held
and of absolute binding authority upon all
members of the order. No pubUc an
nouncements were made 33 to the candi
dates. Sometimes they were chosen from
the most acceptable names on the ticket.!
of the great parties, and the calculations
of the party managers were often mys
teriously brought to naught, and elections
were decided in a surprising manner by
an unknown, incalculable force, dread
ed by both Whigs and Democrats.
The causes of the rise of this curious
order may be traced back almost to the
auoption of the constitution, to the time
when the line of division between Federal
ists and Republicans began to be affected
by the character and temper of the im
migrants -who came from Europe. Many
of these were exiles from their own Janil
as unfriendly to its government. Thoy
were naturally attracted most strongly to
the Republican or Democratic party, and
naturally also a disposition to resent alien
influence in American politics sained
strength among the Federalists. The alien
In 182S a New York man named William
Morgan threatened to publish a book
which he had written exposing the
secrets of the Order of Freemasons.
Shortly after he disappeared and was
never again heard of. There was wide
spread excitement. The leading Free
masons of the region were freely charged
with having conspired for Morgans
abduction and murder. Nothing was
ever proved, but the strong feeling arous
ed took a political aspect. A large anti-
Masontc vote was cast at local elections
against candidates who were Masons.
Bv 1S30 the anti-Masons had absorbed or
displaced the National Republican party
in New York. Among the prominent anti-
Masons were Thurlow Weed. William H.
Sewhrd and Millard Fillmore. The new
party spread and gathered considerable
force in some of the other States and in
1831 it took the field as a national or
ganization. Its national convention of
that year was the first in our history.
By nominating William Wirt of Maryland
for President the anti-Masons hoped to
prevent the nomination of Clay by the
National Republicans The result of the
election was to give the anti-Masons the
electoral vote of Vermont only. They
p ayed some further part in State politics
in one or two States, but never again fig
ured in national affairs. Most of them
went into the Whig party, which they
were able to Influence in tne campa gn of
1S40 so far as to defeat the nomination of
Clay and force that of Harrison.
The history of the anti-Masonic party
illustrates the impossibility of etfecuyely
maintaining a national party organization
upon the narrow basis of u -Ingle iaea , not
vitally Â¦ connected with broad political
principles.

These are all factional names originating
in New York. The "Hunkers" are some
times identified with "Bucktails"âmean
ing those opposed to the canal system
hut such an application of the title is
retrospective rather than exact, for the
name did not come into use until about
1844. It was applied to the conservative
Democrats, representing, says Professor
Johnston, "the inertia of the party" and
opposed to the "Barn-burners," who were
the radicals. The name is believed to have
come from the Dutch word "houk. sta

Van Buren as their leader and with him

Into these two factions the Democratic
party was more and more widely split
during the years from 1844 to 1848 The
division was apparently healed In 1So2. but
reappeared almost immediately, the HunK
ers calling themselves the "hards or
"hardshells," while their opponents were
known as "softs> The line of separa
tion was drawn Jhlefly with reference to
the slavery question. This factional dis
integration of the Democratic party gave
opportunity to the Whigs, who elected
their State ticket in 1SS4. and the Demo
crats of New York did not regain a ma
jority untH 1862.
As the Democratic party in New York
was split by the canal question and by
the slavery question, so also was It split
by the bank controversy during lv>3-39.
The "regular" Democrats, while opposing
the United States Bank, favored the char
tering of new State banks. The loco
focos" caled themselves the "equal rights
party" and opposed the giving of special
privileges to any incorporated bodies. The
name "loco foco" seemed to strike the
popular fancy and ere long became na
tional in its use as designating the radi
cal wing of the Democratic party and was
often used in a general way for the whole

to the year 1S34, when at a stormy Demo

York city, the regular Tammany Demo
crats turned out the gas and withdrew.
The other factidn were supplied with
candles, which they immediately lighted
with loco-foco (or friction) matches and
went on with their business.
The two branches of the party In New
York were brought together in 1S37 by the
skillful management of President v an
Buren, but for some ten years longer the
National Whig party persistently applied
the name "loco focos" to their opponents,
seeking thus to imply that the Democrats
were opposed to the moneyed Interests of

Those in the New York Assembly most
strongly opposed to the Erie canal were
the Tammany members of the Republican
party from New York City. One of the
emblems of the Tammany society was a
buck's tail worn in the hat. and from that
came the name "Bucktall3," by which
they were commonly known. Durii..; the

plied in a general way to all who opposed
the canal system.
The factions in New York parties always
tended to play an important part In what
are known as "third party" movements in
national politics. This was true in respect
to the wide question of internal improve
ments, but these local names have, strict
ly speaking, no place In national party
history.

promotion of that enterprise De Witt Clin

named "Clinton's ditch." Hence those fa

Besides the two leading political parties
which have embraced the great body of
American voters little groups or coteries
of citizens desirous of inaugurating some
political or industrial or social reform, or
factions especially opposed to certain
measures or tendencies of the great par
ties, have sometimes assumed the name
and form of political parties. Occasionally
these have become powerful enough per
manently to influence, for good or ill. the
course of political history. More frequent
ly they have proved of little lasting con
sequence and have only strewn along the
current a series of grotesque or. temporar
ily significant names whose origin and
meaning have been soon forgotten. Some
of the earlier of these names crept into
national political history from the fac
tional strifes which very soon became
characteristic of New York politics, 'me

AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
and sedition laws, passed In IT3S by Â¦
Federalist Congress, illustrate thi3. In 1S33
to 1S37 a revival of the feeling against giv
ing political place and power to foreigners
was attempted in New York City, where
the foreign population was growing rapid
ly. For some years the idea of natlvism
as opposed to alienism figured more or
less in State and local politics in several
States, and led to occasional violence and
even bloodshed at the polls.
But It was not until about 1S32, when tho
sectional slavery agitation was becoming;
serious, that partisan jealousy of foreign
political influence, having assumed a now
form, began to take a decisive hand In
party struggles. The secret order was
variously designated. Its real name La
said to have been "The Son3 of '76, or tho
Order of the Star-Spang!ed Banner.' " but
it has enme down in history as the
"American", party, or more familiarly tho
"Know-Nothings." because its members
when questioned gave the invariable re
ply. "I don't know." The ends sought
came, ere Ions to be known as the placing
and fceeping of ail political power in tho
hand:* of native Protestant Americans.
and the making of opposition to Roman
Catholicism an issue in American politics.
Advocacy of these principles wa.s, of
course, strongest In the /"Whig party, for
the Democratic ranks were constantly
swelled by newly naturalized Immigrants,
many of whom were Catholics.
In the formation of the Republican
party in l!OJ those Whics who were un
willing to gn the length proposed by the
leaders of the new party in hostility toÂ«
slavery saw nothing left for them hut to>
unite with the anti-alien party, which had
by that time accepted the name American.
It was only in the Middle and Southern
States that the "Americans" ever ac
quired much strength. in the South,
where native feeling was strong and tho
foreign element almost nil, it practically
took the place of the Whig party. Its tirst
appearance as a national party was in
ljÂ£ti. when u secret convention adopted an
imposing platform and an open conven
tion nominated Millard Fillmore for Pres
ident. In the election which followed tho
eight electoral votes of Maryland were all
that went to the ambitious American par
ty, though the popular vote was S74.5S4.
Once more. In 1S60. the "Americans" went
into the Presidential campaign, and then
disappeared, having shown, as Horace
Creeley said, "about as many of the ele
ments of persistence as an anti-cholera OC
an antit-potato rot party would have."
The Liberty and Free Soil Parties.
The American Anti-Slavery Society be
came divided about 1833 into two sections
over the question of political action. TheÂ»
Garrisonian abolitionists refused to recog
nize or to have any relations with a nation
al government whose constitution mad a
compromises with the iniquitous system cÂ«f
slavery. The more moderate wing favored
political methods of working against the
evil, and urged the nominaton and sup
port of abolitionists for office. A conven
tion of these seceders. as they were called,
met at Albany in 1S40, and named them
selves the Liberty party and nominated
James G. Birney for the Presidency. Al
though he declined the honor, soma 700O
votes were nevertheless cast for him at
the election. In 1S44 Birney was again tho
nominee of the Liberty party, and re
ceived 62.300 votes â enough, it will be re
membered, to defeat Clay and elect Polk.
Though the Liberty party held a con
vention in 1S47 and nominated candidates,
the political conditions of the next year
induced the leaders to abandon the organ
ization and join with the barn-burners to
form the Free Soil party. The new party
held a convention at Buffalo. Their chief
principle, as promulgated in the preamble
to their long platform, was declared to
be the securing of "free soil to free peo
ple," and they avowed a determined hos
tility to any further extension of slavery.
The vote cast for the Free Soil candidate
was 201.2S3. nearly all being from the free
States. Both of the old parties were more
or less surprised and demoralized, and tbu a
Whig candidate was elected.
The compromises of 1S30 were reJecbM
by the Free Soilers. and in 1SG2 they took
the name of "Free Democracy," and
nominated John P. Hale and George "W.
Julian. Their platform denuonced both
Whigs and Democrats as each one wing
" of the great slave compromise party of,
the nation." The vote polled was but a
little more than half that of tho preced
ing campaign.
Before another Presidential election
both Whigs and Free Soilers. or Frea
Democrats, had disappeared from Con
gress. The party has a history of only
about five years. At the end of that
time it helped to form the Republican
party.

In St. Mary's Cathedral solemn high
mass was celebrated at 11 a. m. by Rev.
Father Ramm, with Rev. Father Hannl
g.m as deacon and Rev. Father O'Malley
ns sub-deacon. The regular choir, under
the direction of Organist R. J. Harrison,
intoned Mozart's "Twelfth Mass."
"The Apostles," said Father O'Ryan,
who preached the sermon, "were not equal
to the task of transforming and super
naturalizing human society after our di
vine I.iord left them to ascend Into heaven,
because^ they were weak and vacillating
men. with no learning. They were not
litted to accomplish the great mission left
to them by Chrl3t until Providence gave
them a means by v/hich they were ena
bled to teach the truths of the Catholic
religion. There came to them one day the
Holy Ghost in the form of hot tongues of
lire, and behold! the transformation was
complete. They became strong with the
strength of the Holy Ghost.
"Before this great miracle was visited
upon the apostles they had not lightâ now
they are enlightened by the light divine;
before, they spoke of things that were
humanâ now they discuss divine subjects
only. As they were transformed by the
Holy Ghost, so they in their turn trans
formed the world* They were clothed with
the power of working among the souls of
men and were prepared to conquer the
world. They went against the great pow
ers, amid the camps of soldiers, the pal
aces of princes and the halls of the
learned, and were victorious. They formed
a mighty kingdom which has lasted
through all time, that has achieved results
which cannot be attributed to human
agencies.
"Our voices should be raised in thanks
to Almighty God, who transformed the
apostles so that the whole world was
brought before the feet of Christ. Paga
ism, heresy and human passions have
succumbed to the superior power of the
kingdom, which became renovated and
strengthened through the influence of the
Hol/Ghost.
"On this great Feast of Pentecost we
should give thanks for the great favor of
being members of that great society, and
realize that the Holy Ghost has a mission
in ourselves. He dwells with each of us
who are sanctified by the sacraments of
baptism and confirmation, and gives us
the power of being sons of God. It is a
glorious inheritance and a precious legacy
left to us. and we should make resolutions
to harken to his voice and show ourselves
worthy of the great favor." -â¢ '*-â¢ -
Solemn high mass was celebrated in St.
Ignatius Church at 10:30 o'clock by Rev.
Father Allen, assisted by Rev. Father

deacon. Music was rendered by the choir
under the direction of Rev. Father Allen.
Rev Father Culligan was master of cere
monies. The sermon was preached by
Rev Father Chiappa. who took his text
.from the gospel of the day: "Paracleteâ
Thâ¢ Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in, my name. He will teach you all

Father Chiappa. "the apostles felt liko
orphans bereft of their beloved father,
teacher, comforter and protector. But
to console them our beloved Redeemer
promised us the Paraclete, the HolyUhost,
who would teach us all thingsâ another
protector who would endow them with his
own divine power and lead them under
his guidance to the conquest of the world,
to the conversion of the human race from
the darkness of paganism to the light of
faith and from the shadow of death to the
never-fading light of life eternal.
"The apostles, however, understood out
little of the meaning of his words, but;
dimly understood who the Holy Ghost
was and what wonders he had already
performed, but they soon realized his
wonderful power in endowing them with
great privileges. Christ was conceived
bv the Holy Ghost and born of the Virgin
Mary who is the immaculate spouse or
the spirit of God and the virgin mother of
our Savior, Jesus Christ. It was the
Holy Ghost that urged the apostles on io
action and to untiring zeal and persever
ance amid the countless hardships, fatigue
and privation which they met on all sides
in the faithful discharge of the mission
of preaching the gospel to all creation.
All saints, in fact, of the old and new dis
pensation are but mouthpieces of divine
grace which is poured into their souls by

special train conveyed the happy throng
to the picnic grounds, leaving the city at
S<:1S a. ra. Or. the arrival of the train

THERE was a sufficient quantity of
food and liquids given away as
prizes at the twenty-ninth annual
picnic of the Retail Grocers' Pro
tective Union at Schuetzen Park yester
day to stock a grocery store and saloon.
Holders of lucky coupons, experts , with
the rifle and those who were fleet of foot
were all awarded something of value for
their efforts. The prizes ranged from a
ruck of flour to a cake of soap; from root
beer to a case of double-distilled fire wa
ter. Fortunately for the good of the or
ganization, the liquids won at the picnic
were not distributed on the gro.unds. In
this the committee displayed wisdom.
Had the wet goods been distributed at
once the ferry-boat could not have held
the "loads" that would have come aboard.
The committee also deemed it best not to
distribute the staple articles won by the
fortunate ones. It certainly would have
locked undignified for the picnickers to
be seen carrying through the streets a
blue agate tea kettle, a boiled ham, 100
pounds of washing soda, six sacks of
Monterey sand, a can of coal oil or three
boxes or smoked herring. The foregoing
prizes and hundreds of others will be col
lected to-day.
The men who dole out mixed and un
mixed sugar with a lavish hand were
present in large numbers, aa were their
customers and friends. Business cares
were forgotten for the nonce, and proprie
tor and clerk and purchaser mingled in
happy comradeship. "Withal it was an
enjoyable outing. The cold winds that
blew over the city gave way to the
balmy climate of Marin County, and the
merrymakers did not regret their ducks
and other airv summer costumes.
Von der-Mehden's band played for those
who "tripped the light fantastic." The
swings were the center of attraction
throughout the day. Young ladies who
did not hesitate to show lingerie and
shapely ankles enjoyed the rythmlc mo
tion despite the eye3 leveled at them. The
games, as. usual, proved highly exciting.
There was bowling for the grocers, tar
get shooting for the ladies and prizes for
all. The high scores on the target made
by the fair sex were surprising. Some of
the ladies simply pointed the gun at the
target, closed their eyes and fired. Oth
ers devoutly wished that they might hit
the painted circle. In both instances suc
cess or a charitable "marker" gave them
scores that surpassed those made by the
sterner sex. Following is the result of
the games and shooting contests:
Race for Klrls between 12 and 13 â Katie Rob
ins -von, Mollie Hanson second, Grace Dryer
third.
Race for girls between 9 and 12â May Denehy
won, Ethel Dryer second. Katie Smith third.

THIS Is the season of the year
when picnics are in full swing
and the residents of this city
take advantage of the Sab
bath to seek recreation In the
country. On each Sunday thou
sands wend their way to the fer
ries and take passage for some
pleasant spot to spend a well
earned holiday. Despite the cold
wind that blew over the city yes
terday the ferry depots were alive
with life and color. Young men
and young women, attired in sum
mer costumos and burdened with
bounteous iuuch boxes and baskets,
pas <- i through the gates en route
to e .ones of pleasure. On preced
ing Sundays the crowds have
been larger, due to climatic condi
tions. A large number of people
refrained from leaving their happy
homes yesterday because of the
cold weather. Nevertheless, there
were five picnics in the parks
around the bay and all were well
attended. The Hermann's Sons
celebrated their thirtieth anniver
sary with an excursion to Sunset
Park. Santa Cruz Mountains. The
members of the Garibaldi Guard
picnicked in Buena Vista Park, at
SausaJlto. Mirabel Park, on the
Russian River, was crowded with
friends and members of the Jour
neymen Tailors'. Union. The Inde
pendent Rifles enjoyed a pleasant
day in G!enwopd Park, the
Deutscher Krieger Verein spent
the day at Shell Mound Park, and
lai=t but not lea.-i, the Ketail Gro
cers enjoyed themselves at Schuet

Oakland 10, Sacramento 1.
Mr. Doyle of Sacramento pitched nine
Innings on Saturday and was scattered all
over Recreation grounds. Six innings and
a part of the seventh more than sufficed
yesterday for the Dudes to break him irto
lumps that covered both in and out fields.
Fireworks and nothing but that was
the reason of it. The ball streaked the
field continuously, and occasional errors
helped in sending the Dudes around the
bases to the benches. In the seventh in
ning Doyle was relieved, Eaeran going into
the box, but there wasn't much improve
ment wroufc.'.t on that account. The day
was distinctively one for Ewing, and his
two victories and a tie gave him a spell of
Joy. Oakland played excellent ball, Mos
kiman twirling in splendid style.
Contrary to the general expectation, the
result cf the afternoon game gives Oak
land two out of the series of three, the
third game having no effect In the reckon
ing, as it was a tie.
The Dudes started to repeat their swat
ting: performance of the day before, and
found Mr. Doyle for two hits at the be
ginning of the game. Schmeer hit to
Eagan, beating the ball out at first and
going to second on Hammond's hit to
Doyle, who fumbled the bail, making both
runners safe. A two-bagger by Hutchin
son scored Schmeer. Then came a tripli
cate of deaths, and the Dudes went to
the field.
In the fourth Lange was sent across the
rubber. Reaching first on a hit he camped
at the middle station, when Drennan
drove a hot liner to Devereaux. who fum
bled, stole third when Drennan went to
second, and scored on Schmeer's out.
The tifth inning was pyrotechnical and
food for joy on the part of the Dudet>.
Again was Mr. Doyle of Sacramento
toucnedâ this time for five hits and four
runs. Hutchinson walked, followed by a
two-bagger from Moskiman's bat. and
scoring on Dunleavy's out. Moskiman
crossed the plate on Lange's hit. Dren
nan and Hardie came to the bat. each
getting a hit. and the bags were OUed.
Then came Schmeer, who hit to Eagan,
and in an attempt to shut out Hardie at
second, which miscarrlod. Lange and
Drennan scored. That satislied the Brum
mels, and nothing more was done In that
innine.
Sacramento broke the ice In the sixth.
McLaughlin got into the running on a
hit, stole second, but in attempting to
Fteal third on Devereaux's hit to M(-b
kiman died between the bases, Dcveroiux
reaching s-eennd on the play. Eagan's out
advanced Noisy Bill a base and a passed
ball scored him. In this Inning Oakland
added another run to the list, following
in tne Bevcr.th with a brace, and one in
the eighth. The score is:
OAKLAND.

MORNING GAME.
Oakland 3, Sacramento 3.
With two men out and a Dude on the
second sack the game was called at Oak
land yesterday morning amid the hisses
and shouts of the crowd, who wanted to
see the finish. The score was three all in
the ninth, when the time-limit had ar
rived and the game was called off-
After the ragged performance of the day
before the champions played good ball, as
d'.d also the Dudes. Errors were very
few, and neither Hughes nor Beville was
touched for many hits. At the end of the
seventh Inning the score was tied, the
Dudes havir.s shot a couple of men over
the plate. This had a tendency to make
the game exciting, and when the ninth
was reached the crowd was jubilant. In
the beginning of the inning^ Stultz drove
the ball over the left-Geld fence, skirting
the bags for a homer. But the discrep
ancy in the score did not last long. The
Dudes came to the plate with fire in their
eyes. Schmeer, after one man had per
ished, rolled? the ball out for three bases,
and soon after scored on Hammond's sin
gle, but this was all there was to the
game, which was called soon after ac
cording to prearranged agreement, the
clock then registering 12:10. The score Is:

DOYLE WAS EASY
AND THE DUDES
IN PROPER FORM
Greyhounds trained In the kennels of
Frank McComb swept everything before
them yesterday in the open stake at Union
Coursing Park. The last four dogs left
In the stake were from these kennels, be
ing headed by the black wonder. Royal
Flush. He has oeen out of the running
for three months and the prevailing opin
ion expressed was that he was not on edge
and could not. be expected to win at the
first asking. He did so, however, allowing
only three points to be scored against
him In the six courses he ran. In these
he beat Mamio Pleasant, Castle Island
Boy, Shootover, Flying Fox, O'Hara and
For Glory. The latter was runner-up for
the stake, with feir Pasha third and
O'Hara fourth.
The fourth round provided the sensa
tional coursing of the day, the best dogs
all being brought together. Royal Flush
commenced proceedings by defeating Fly-
Ing Fox. They went up the field like a
double team, but Flush drew out and
killed. Sir Pasha surprised the talent by
retiring Hot Haste after a long undecided
course, which took the brace of dogs
across the field. The score was 6 tc 6. Sir
Pasha scored five and secured one in the
work after placing Hot Haste. The hare
escaped before either dog could score the
extra point necessary to win. The next
time out Sir Pasha won decisively by a
score of 8 to 0. For Glory, the smallest
greyhound In the stake, weighing but for
ty-two pounds, put out the mighty Â¦Whlte
head, the stake favorite. The diminutive
miss proved too fast for the big dog, win
ning by a score of 6 to 3.
This brought the stake down to four
dogs. Royal Flush and Sir Pasha, owned
by Frank McComb. and For Glory and
O'Hara. owned by Sterl & Knowles, but
handled by the former. Flush beat O'Hara
and For Glory disposed of Sir Pasha. In
the final For Glory led her big opponent
from the slips, but once Flush settled
down to his stride he passed her out and
won first money without letting her score.
The first round produced the most upsets
in the betting. Leah beat Rest Assured 5
to 1 Kid McCoy beat Vulcan 3 to 1. Silver
Cloud beat Round About 2 to 1. Hot Haste
beat Brutus 2 to 1, King's Borderer beat
St. Anthony, Anchor beat Rocker and Ju
lius Caesar beat Blackette at 5 to 3. In
the succeeding rounds the favorites were
more generally successful.
Although weather conditions generally
were unfavorable, there was but one un
decided course. The light was bad, but
the dogs evidently had their long distance
glasses on. none going unsighted. The
detailed results, with Judge John Grace s

DOGS FROM THE
McCOMB KENNELS
WIN EVERYTHING
With an eight-dog champion event and
the finals of an open stake on the card,
yesterday's patrons of Ingleside Coursing
Park got a good run or rather many runs
for their money. Lexington beat Misa
Penman in the deciding round of the
open stake after a short run of 33 sec
onds. The dogs met ou even terms, each
having done but light work in the pre
vious rounds.
"When they were slipped Miss Penman
seemed to lead slightly in a long run up,
when Lexington drove out and took the
first turn. In a mix-up Miss Penman took
three quick turns, but Lexington shot and
killed.
In the first round of the- champion stako
the talent was decidedly out of form. OC
the four courses they forced odds that
were false, and as a result the short ends
won every event. In the order named,
Chicago Boy beat Theron pointless at 1 to
2, Master Claire t>eat Mose at 1 to 3,
Mayflower beat Golden Rule at 2 to 5 and
Lowlander beat Sisquoc at 1 to 2.
The coursing was good In all these runs
and of the straight variety without fluk*.
Mose did not run up to form and Master
Claire beat him all the way after an un
decided In the longest course of the day.
Chicago Boy and Master Claire divided
final honors without a race. The former
was undoubtedly the best performer la
the stake.
Lowlander showed well, but was un
lucky In the second round with Master
Claire. He showed the speed and took
first turn, but the hare doubled back to
Master Claire, who made good use of nla
luck.
Chicago Boy and Mayflower furnished
a good short race. The Boy led well and
took the turn, swerving the hare to May
flower, who drove out and killed the hare
and likewise her chances, stopping the
game too soon and losing by a point.

TRUTHS EASILY DIGESTED.
Concerning a Method of Curing Dys-
pepsia and Stomach Troubles.
Dyspepsia and indigestion are consid-
ered incurable by many people who do not
realize the advance made in modern medi-
cal science, and because by the old
methods and remedies a cure was rarely
If ever obtained.
Dyspepsia is now cured as readily a3
any other disease.
What the dyspeptic wants is abundant
nutrition, which means plenty of good,
wholesome, well-cooked food, and sorao
thlng to assist the weak stomach to di-
gest it. This is exactly the purpose for
which Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets aro
adapted and this is the method by which
they cure the worst cases of dyspepsia, in
other words the patient eats plenty of
wholesome food and Stuart'9 Dyspepsia
Tablets digest it for him. In this way
the system Is nourished and the over-
worked stomach rested, because the tab-
lets will digest the food whether the stom-
ach works or not. One of these tablets
will digest SOX) grains of meat or eggs.
â¢ Your druggist will tell you that Steu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets is a remedy sold
on its merits, and is the purest, safest and
cheapest remedy sold for stomach
troubles, and every trial makes one more
friend for this excellent preparation.

At the Columbia Theater to-night N. C.
Goodwin and Marine Elliott will enter
upon the second and final week of their
Immensely sucr-^sful engagement in II.
V l>mur.ds comedy, "When We Were
Twenty-one." The advance f=ale of *eats
for the.Â«e closing nights is in excess of
that for the iirst week, and there will
no doubt be hundreds who will be disap
pointed In not having secured their seats
at an early date. The production is. with

long list of novelties In the line of necro

The prospecting for oil in San Diego
County has caused an examination of
titlei to land -which has not be^n thought
of in many years. In addition to the
prospecting at Del Mar there is some

acres has been leased by Harry K. Hef
fiennan.
Oil men in Southern California have se
cured a lease of 40,CXÂ» acres In Texas,
Â¦which is buppoj^d to contain oil. The
basis of this lnvrstemt-nt is found in sam- .
pies of oil rf-celvÂ«l from Texas and the
etatf-ment that it has been found at a
depth of 1V> feet and even l*ss. C. E. Shat

Funeral of the Lnte Samuel S. Sam
ple, One of the Old-Time
Bonifaces.
A few Intimate friends and the wife and
daughter of the late Samuel S. Sample
gathered at Peterson's undertaking par
lors yesterday afternoon to pay a last
tribute of respect to his memory. A brief
servico was conducted by Rev. E. Cam
eron, after which the body was removed
to Laurel Hill 'Cemetery, where It was
interred. The pallbearers were: T. M.
"Woodson, John A. Currier, Fred Vaughan,
William M. F,dgar. D v McHenry, William
Dorety and Frank Coates.
The deceased was one of tho best known
liquor-dealers in the city. He started In
the business nearly forty yearn ago on
Washington street, between Kearny and
Montgomery streets, opposite Magulrc's
Opera Houpe and his place was the fa
vorite resort of politicians and men about
town. "He retired from business about
eight years ago. He accumulated a- for
tune, but lost' it In speculations. He was
a wholesouled, generous man and made
many friends.- His surviving daughter
married Charles II, Dexter, a well
known sporting man. 'who is'nt present at
Cape Nome. His death was due to a
stroke) of apoplexy. He 'was a native of
Pennsylvania and was C7 years of age.

TRIBUTE OF RESPECT
Shipping Intelligence.
TO SAIL.
Discusses Them From an Economis
Point of ViÂ«w and Suggests
a Remedy.
Professor M. A. Aldrlch of Stanford
University lectured before the Socialist
Labor party at the Turk-street Temple
last night on the subject "Do Strikes
Pay?" Tlw ha'l was well filled with an
attentive audience, and after the lecture
speakers were allowed to answer the prb-
fessor'a arguments.
The lecturer took rather the middle
ground on the whole proposition, arriving
at no definite conclusion. He clteu in
stances of strikes that did pay, not only
In dollars and cents, but as well because
of the influence they had upon employers
and employes; and, aeain, he found
strikes In history that did not pay from
any point of view, and left only disaster
and desolation In their trail. The reme
dy was merely suggested by the speaker.
He Â¦' pointed out that the organization of
labor to resist the encroachments of cap
ital had been offset by similar organiza
tion- of capital. This process has gone
forward until when a clash takes place
between the two great opposed forces the
loss of life and property will be so great
that It will affect the general welfare.
The tendency seemed now to be in times
of strikes to settle the difficulties by con
ferences between the organized bodies of
labor and capital through properly ap.
pointed committees, the speaker said.

Eoth Vessels Under Charter to Load
Wheat for Europeâ Only ThxM
Disengaged Ships xÂ» r ow
Left in Port.
?
The British ship Clan Buchanan, from
Newcastle, Australia, and the Italian ship
Francesco Ciampa, from Iquique, made
port yesterday after good runs. The Clan
Buchanan came over from Australia in
sixty-four days, beating the ship Balclu
tha, now out seventy days, the ship Elm
hurst, out eighty days, and the ship
Windsor Park, out ninety-eight days from
Newcastle. The Windsor Park is the only
one of the fleet that has been spoken, and
on March 12 she was.in latitude 32 degrees
49 minutes south, longitude 173 degrees 3i)
minutes east.
The Francesco Ciampa came from
Iquique with a load of nitrate of soda In
fifty-six days. The Hawaiian four-masted
schooner Americana is now out ninety-six
days from Iquique and It is about tima
she was showing up. The chances are she
has got caught in the doldrums on the
equator and her crew has had nothing to
do but curse their luck.
Both the Clan Buchanan and Francesco
Ciampa are chartered to load wheat for
.Europe, so the disengaged fleet will not
be increased by their arrival. At the
present time there are only three deep
water vessels disengaged in port and they
lost their charters through making long
passages. The Blackbraes was disabled
off the Horn and had to put into Port
Stanley for repairs. She was 855 days get
ting here from Newcastle, England. The
Musselcrag was also disabled off the Horn
and came here by way. of the Cape of
Oood Hope and Sydney, X. S. \V. She. was
313 days coming from Antwerp.
The third vessel of the disengaged fleet
is the American ship Cyrus Wakefield.
She was thirty-three days coming here
from the Hawaiian Islands with a load
of sugar, and during the ; passage was
caught in a storm which sprung her fore
topmast head and carried away the main
topgallant mast. She is now being over
hauled at Howard-street wharf and will
probably go back into the sugar trade
when the repairs are completed.'
Levensaler Saved His Contract.
J. G. Levensaler, the well-known steve
dore, saved a contract from lapsing by
just ten minutes Saturday.' The steamer
Manauense is at Crockett with a cargo of
sugar and Levensaler has the contract to
discharge her. He engaged a lot of men
at Crockett, but when they began using
hooks and tearing the bags the owners
made a vigorous protest. Levensaler told
the men they must stop using the hooks
and they, secure in the fact that there
were no more men in Crockett, told him
they would do as they pleased. Levensaler
discharged every man of them on the spot
and came to San Francisco to get another
gang. He was gone some time and the
fiugar company, getting tired of waiting,
telegraphed to Captain Bennett to come
up and bring men with him to finish un
loading the vessel.
When Levensaler heard that Captain
Bennt*t was going to Crockett with a
gang of 'longshoremen on the 4 p. m. train
he lost no time in getting his men to
gether and starting away in a launch. He
reached the Manauense ten minutes ahead
of the train and when Captain Bennett
and his 'longshoremen reached the scene
Levensaler's men were hard at work dis
charging the ship. Now somebody will
have to pay the 'longshoremen and the
question is, outof whose pocket will the
money come?
A Fast Trip to Manila.
The American four-masted bark Krskine
M. Phelps, now on her way from the Phil
ippines to Honolulu to load sugar for New
York, made the fastest run of the year
from Norfolk, Va., to Manila. She left
Norfolk on November 18 and averaged 195
knots a day for poventy-seven days,
which carried her to the island of Surriba,
at the entrance to the straits of Ombay.
On that showing Captain Graham expect
ed to make the run to Manila in record
breaking time, but light and contrary
winds, calms and adverse currents in the
passage spoiled the ship's chances and
the average each day was only sixty-five
knots, much to the disgust of everybody
on board. The Phelp3 was 122 days makÂ«
Ing the run, which is nevertheless a good
showing, considering the average run la
150 days. The Phelps discharged 4627 tons
of cool at the navy yard at Cavite and on
April 24 sailed for Honolulu In ballast.
The Ersklne M. Phelps will be remem
bered as one of the handsomest steel
ships that ever came to this port. Captain
Graham has a host of friends in San
Francisco who will be glad to hear of his
whereabouts. He is accompanied by his
wife and daughter Gladys.
"Water Front Notes.
The Southern Pacific's tug Collis arrived
from Port Los Angelea yesterday. She
come here for her yearly overhauling and
inspection.
The schooner Del Xorte and the steamer
Del Norte both reached port from Qregqn
yesterday. The schooner made the run
from Frankport in forty-eight hours,
while the steamer was ninety-six hours
from Portland, via Eureka, twenty-four
hours.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
new tug Shelikof sailed for the canneries
via Seattle yesterday. She will be used
as a tender for the fleet in Bristol Bay
during the season. '

NEXT GRAND AERIE OF
EAGLES WILL MEET HERE
Three Members of the Local Lodge
Secure It for San Fran
cisco.
Through the persuasive eloquence and
liberal spirit manifested by the San Fran
cisco delegates to the grand convention of
the Fraternal Order of Just
brought to a close at Vancouver, this city
has secured the next cession of the grand
lodge, or Grand Aerie, as It Is called.
This order is of less than two years'
growth. It started in- Seattle about
eighteen months ago with less than one
hundred members, and is now \ r ery pow
erful. A candidate's occupation, no mat
ter what It may be, does not debar -him
from admission so long as he possesses
merit and morals to justify his affiliation
with his fellow man. .
At the convention just -rlosed this State
and city were represented by E. L. Wag
ner, past president and district delegate
for California; James. F. Cheatham. past
president and State organizer, and E. L.
Head, president of Aerie No. 5. San Fran
cisco. These three men stood together on
all propositions, with the general view. of
securing for this city the next session of
the Grand Aerie, which wili assemble on
the 14th of May. 1301.
To E. L. Wagner belongs much of the
credit of winning. the fight for San Fran
cisco. This city was opposod by n com
bination of delegates from other States.
Umte. Mont., offered to guarantee $25,000
for the convention. Astoria, Kansas City
and Minneapolis also tried to secure it.
Against all of these Wagner and his co
workers had to contend. There will be
about 300 delegates.

Policeman Michael McHugh, attached to
the Mission district, was nearly murdered
by two yewung- toughs at Twelfth and Har
rison streets yesterday' afternoon. Al
though faint from his wounds and loss
of blood, he succeeded in arresting one of
them after subduing him by a blow on the
head with his club.
A number of hoodlums had been drink-
Ing in a saloon on the corner of Twelfth
and Harrison streets. They went into a
barn there and made so much disturbance
that the saloonkeeper sent a message to
the Seventeenth-street station for an offi
cer to subdue them. Policeman McHugh
was sent and when he reached the barn
the noise was appalling. He placed "Skin
ny" Porter, the ringleader, under arrest,
and while taking him to the patrol box
Charles Ryan sneaked up behind the offi
cer and struck him on the back of the
head with a shovel, cutting through hia
helmet and opening his scalp.
McHugh wheeled around and got an
other blow from the shovel on the fore
head which dazed him. He released his
hold of Porter and grabbed hold of Ryan.
They fought all over the street and Porter
struck the bleeding and almost uncon
scious officer with some blunt instrument,
probably the shovel. McHugh drew his
club and hit Ryan a blow. on the head
Tihich took all the fight out of him. Por
ter, not relishing a similar experience,
ran away and the police are searching for
McHugh and Ryan Were taken in the
patrol wagon to tha Receiving Hospital.
McHugh's coat and vest â¢ were covered
with blood which flowed from the wound3
In the back of his head and forehead.
Dr. Bunnell found that the cuts were
deep and long and the officer's skull may
be fractured. Ryan had a lacerated but
not serious wound on the scalp. . â¢
After Ryan's wound .was dressed Mc-
Hugh took him to the City Prison, where
a charge of assault with a deadly weapon
was booked against him. A similar
charge will be made against Porter when
arrested. '
Although Bleeding- and Almost Un
conscious, He Succeeded in Sub
duing and Arresting One of
His Assailants.

Well-Known Physician Dies
Suddenly at v Menlo
Park.
DR. JOHN NIGHTINGALE, the well
known physician, died yesterday
morning at Menlo Park. His death
was -sudden, although not wholly
unexpected, and has cast a gloom on his
family and intimate friends. When death
closed his career Dr. Nightingale was vis
iting the home of his friend Chris Smith.
The immediate cause of death was heart
disease.
Dr. Nightingale had been a sufferer dur
ing the past ten years. In the winter of
1S90 he contracted the grip arid never re-,
covered from its effects. It left his sys
tem in a weakened condition and he was
susceptible to the varying conditions bf
the weather.
At the time of his death Dr. Nightingale
was in his forty-fifth year. He was a son
of John Nightingale,, the capitalist, and
resided with his father at COO Halght
street. He received his early, education
in the schools of this city and was then
sent by his parents to Germany and Paris
to finish his medical studies. After he ob
tained his 'degree: he traveled through
Kuropc in company with James L. Flood,
Joseph Grant and George Crocker. .He re
turned to this city in JS78 and immediate
ly took up the practice of medicine. He
gradually developed a lucrative practice,
which he was compelled' to give up on ac
count of ill health. During, the. past ten
years he devoted his time tb looking after
his father"s extensive business interests.
He was elected a freeholder and helped
frame the present city charter.
The funeral will be held to-morrow. The
body will be taken from Menlo Park to
Cypress Lawn Cemetery.: where services
will be held in the cjiapel. The body will
be interred in the mausoleum erected by
his father. ', . â¢

The belated citizens of San Francisco'
who happened to be passing the lit
tle alley tunning from Ellis to
Eddy street, above Powell, known
os Anna lane or Glasgow street, at 4
o'clock or thereabouts yesterday
morning' were treated to the sight of an
impromptu boxing contest, one of the
principals in which is the scion of one of
the foremost families of America, the?
other being known among horsemen ana
racetrack frequenters from the Atlantic
to the Pacific, while the referee is a come
dian of world-wide fame.
Shortly before the hour mentioned there
was gathered m one of tne well-known
retorts in that neighborhood a coterie of
good CetiowB who nail Â«ist-embled to ex
change gossip and take a social glass.
Whik' thus engaged they were joined by
do less a personage than J. Morgan Smith,
late member or the crew ot me i-ieam
whulii:g vessel Belvedere and formerly
one ot Sew York's society pets, ij.-nun
has been sojourning in San Francisco lor
the past three years and durmjj that time
has been supported by remittances from
i datives in Mew York. Keceiuly he was

Li'il was finally settled and the suit dis
missed.

day uas ins next bid for notoriety.
When tin uh joined the party tliere were
j.rest-iit Xat C". truodwln, "Sandy" â¢ Mc
.\aughton, owner of Semper Lex and other
well-Known racehorses, and several other
BcnUemea well known about town. The
proud possessor of a recorded pedigree
and a bunch of rich relatives was in a lo
quacious mood and began to expound on
pugiiij-rn. lie declared in accents loud
xf.m no haa received his instructions in
boxing from no less a personage than the
leaouotable and rejuvenated James J.
Corbelt, aud emphasized his remarks by
leaUins hie left lor Mr. McNaughton's
jt v. i.he blow tailed to land only because
of that gentleman's clever ducking.
Angry words followed the onslaught and
Dm ijarticliiants adjourned to the alley,
where, wiui regularly selected seconds,
bottle-holders, towel-wlelders and advis
ers, the two belligerents prepared to do
liattle. Mr. Goodwin acted in the double
capacity of timekeeper and referee.
The l:rst round was mainly a sizing-up
performance by both principals, but in the
j>econd round the contestants went at it
to regular professional style. They had
BÂ£reed to abide by Ftrict Queensberry
rules ana v/hen the referee's voice cried
"break" they parted like old ringsters and
were at it agrain, each endeavoring to put
their left on a vital point.
Both men Fhowea by their cleverness
that they were adepts in the art of box-
Ing, and. although there was a great dis
parity in. tize and weight, McXaughton
being at least a foot ttiorter and thirty
pounds lighter, the men seemed evenly
matched.
In the third round Smith secured two
knockdowns, but McXaughton was up and
lighting gamely ;tnd at the end of the
round had evened up matters by placing
a vicious right hook on his tall opponent's
left optic
At the call of tfme for the fourth and
final round both men sprang to their feet
with a do-or-die look upon their faces. It
was in this round that most of the llght
j'^s was done. McNauphton led for the
exÂ»whaler'a body, but ltll short, and was
met by Smith's right to the jaw. which
sent the horse owner down for nine sec
onds, v.-hich were counted off by the ref
eree, with remarks of "Get up. Sandy,"
between counts. After a few more ex
changes the battle was suddenly conclud
ed by Smith running into a well aimed
right cross on the jaw.
Ai'tf-r the battle both contestants were
congratulated by the referee, ar.d after
shaking hands and being assured by Mr.
Goodwin that it was one of the bes{ con
tests he had ever witnessed the party ad
journed to a near-by cafe and victor and
vanquished partook of many small "bots "
McNaughton is but little the worse for
Â¦wear as a result of the mill. Smith Is
nursing a black eye.

AS A REFEREE
IS A SUCCESS
So long as- there is a. quarantine about
Chinatown the Board : of Health has come
to the conclusion that it must be a good
one and not one of sievelike characteris
tics.' To that end it has decided to make
the quarantine line at least twenty feet
wide; that is. It shall no longer be possi
ble for people from the inside to come to
one side of a rope and shake hands and
hold heart to heart talks with people on
the other side, as if no quarantine exist
ed.; Instead, it has been decided tl*a.t the
zone of protection shall be at least twenty
feet broad and no one may encroach upon
It. Twenty feet of Chinatown air is con
sidered sufficient, to kill any germ that
might show a disposition to wander out of
bounds. .
The passes heretofore issued with such
a lavish hand will also be curtailed and
many of those already issued will be
taken up. It has been customary to in
oculate a person with a little of the proph
ylactic and then give him, a pass to
I come and go through the lines, provided
he escape each time by way of the fuml
gator on Portsmouth square, but this will
be stopped. Hereafter, if present Inten
tions be carried out, the chances of run
ning the quarantine might be likened to
; the. problem of the camel and the needle's
eye referred to inthe Scriptures.
The Board of Health met yesterday af
ternoon, in pursuance of a resolution that
requires a meeting every day during these
times. The new regulations regarding
quarantine came up in the form of a re
port from the committee on quarantine
of the board. The committee further rec
ommended that a camp of detention for
the indigent of the quarantined quarter
be established on Angel Island, near the
Government station, and this recommen
dation was supplemented by one from Dr.
McCarthy, who suggested Mission Rock
for the same purpose. The outcome of
the recommendations will be the estab
lishment of two stations, one at each
place, the first one to be on Mission Rock,
as it is the easiest to get in order. The*
plan was considered a particularly good
one, as it combined the features of an
effective quarantine as well as a place to
care for the. indigent, and by its isolation
a place distasteful to all those not actu
ally in need of assistance from the city.
The board threw its gauntlet at the
three physicians retained by the Six Com
paniesâDr. Hodghead, Dr. Pillsbury and
Dr. Powers. These three physicians had
been visiting Chinatown by permission,
which permission was withdrawn Satur
day afternoon. The question of renewing
these permits came up yesterday and was
put over another day. Then a resolution
was passed which places in quarantine the
persons and the laboratories of all per
sons, except the authorized officers of the
Board of Health, who have taken tissue
from bodies of dead Chinese for purposes
of investigation or experiment. This rule
is especially interesting when it is known
that In the last case reported the three
doctors of the Six Companies got in ahead
of the bacteriologist and the autopsy phy
sicians oÂ£Â» the board and removed speci
mens from the glands of the dead* man.
The new rule means that Dr. . Hodghead.
Dr., Pillsbury and Dr. Powers and their
laboratories must go into seclusion for a
time, the length of which will be deter
mined by the time it takes them to make
up their minds to be good.
The case in question was one reported
to the board yesterday as showing * sus
picious symptoms. It is that of Chaw Gue
Gong, a Chinese, who for the past nine
teen months has lain sick at 817 Clay
street. He. died Saturday and yesterday
morning an autopsy was held. When the
physicians started to work upon the body,
however, they found that others had been
before them, hence the order relegating
t^e three doctors to temporary retirement.
In this connection the following communi
cation received at this office yesterday is
of interest:
We, the undersigned, note two statements
in the Examiner of to-day, one accredited
to Dr. Williamson, the second to Dr. Kel
logir. The first charges us with having re
moved portions of a Chinaman's body,
"whereby." says Dr. WUUamsonV "evi
dence which might be of great value to us
was destroyed." Dr. Kellogrp. after making ?
the same charge, states that "care was
taken to make the incisions before we were
notified of the .death." These two state
ments* are absolutely false. ! Dr. d'Arcey
Power notified the Board of Health of the
ca?e in question at 3:40 p. m. in the pres
ence of the members of the firm of Reddy,
Campbell & Metson and other of the Six
".Company attorneys, and half an hour later,
Â¦with the rest of the undersigned, went with
Dr.vHereford and another employe of the
â¢Board of Health to view the body, and Dr.
* d'Arcey Power read to the officers of the:
Board of Health his notes for their nsatst
ance. At that time no gland tissues had
been removed, nor was any removed until
.7:30 p. m. ( when Dr. Pillsbury. in our pres
ence and at the request' of the representa
tives of the Chinese Six Companies, re
moved two Hmall portion's of gland tissue,
leaving many times that amount for the
use of the Doard of Health. The bod v at
that time was still in charge of the Chinese
said to be relatives and not under the con
trol of the Board of Health. These facts
were- necessarily known to the said board,
and we therefore reassert that Drs. Wil
liamson and Kellogg willfully misstated the
facts in a manner calculated to prejudice
the public against us>. If our action in this
case be compared with the action of K the
board In the case of Dang Hong, wherein
we were ' denied all access to the body,
which, after' Dr. O'Brien had Issued to us
, passes' for the purpose of viewing the same,
was nevertheless hastily inclosed In lime
and all further Investigation shut oft. It will
be -sufficiently apparent vvfio are the real
destroyers of evidence.
< The undersigned are - the duly appointed
physicians and specialists for the Chinese
Six Companies and for the past five days
Â¦ have been pursuing their assigned duties In
Chinatown of visiting the sick, examining
dead and attending autopsies upon bodies ot
deceased Chinese, besides making bacterio
logical examinations of tissues taken from
said bodies. 'We. have at all times acted In
strict , conformity to the regulations of the
board as we understood them, and have at
no time done any act in violation of the
board's orders. For reasons unknown to us,
and which are entirely without Justification,
the board on Saturday afternoon rescinded
, the permission It had heretofore given us
to visit the quarantine district end denied
us the right to further visit Chinatown and
pursue our work there. We were informed
of this at 6 o'clock on Saturday afternoon.
Up to that time we had not Intended to re
move any tisrue except at the autopsy to
bÂ« .held by the board on the morrow, and
at which we. expected to he present. . But
we now realized that we should.be shut out
and : prevented from attending ihe x autopsy
or obtaining specimens. Not wishing to
trust the conclusions as to whether this
was a cape of plasue to .the board we ds
termlned, and 'were so advised by th? at
torneys f or vthe' Chinese.' T to revisit Chlna
Â¦'town before the orders to exclude us reached
there and to take parts of the bodies needed,
having care, however, to take only a small
.portion of two glands. leaving ahundance
of the same material for the board's opera
tions. This is the reason for our action,
for which no excuse Is needpd.
H. D'ARCT POWKR,
I>. A. HODGHEAP, J
E. S. PILLSBURY.
The hoard also decided that those who
had business to transact within the quar
antined district be notified that they miKht
have an apent- inside with" whom they
might do business, but that he would not
be allowed .outside. It was decided, ton,
to put rnorn garbage iwa&orts in/operation
in the distrlct'a'nd to use more care in the
collection' of garbage. -
Dr.'Bnzet was appointed a member of
the quarantine committee of the board,
and the, committee was directed to confer
whenever possible' with Dr. Klnyoun of
the Federal quarantine service.
