RETIRED OFFICERS
FOR ACTIVE DUTY

WASHINGTON, June 23.â The exigen
cies arising out of the present situation
in China have necessitated the employ
ment of retired officers on active duty.
The first siich officer ordered to duty !s
Lieutenant Richard H. Townley. who was
retired thirteen years ago and who Is di
rected to leave San Francisco on July 10
for Manila for duty. Secretary Long has
decided that he will assign to duty re
tired officers who are of low rank and
have been retired recently. The Navy
Department is particularly In need of
watch and division officer*.
The Navy Department has been assured
that the officers are ready for duty in
China by applicants from many who de
sire to go immediately to the Asiatic Pta
tion. A dispatch was received to-day from
San Francisco signed by Captain Mayo,
Lieutenant Commander Milton and Lieu
tenants McElroy. Ackerman and Vogel
sar.s, declaring their readiness to go to
Chlr.a on . short notice. Commander
Cowles, acting chief of the bureau of nav

for placing his sen-Ices at the disposal' of
the Government, but Indicating .that they

NEW YORK, June 26. â A World special from Chefu says: Seymour, commanding the
Peking relief forces, is besieged. Heliograph communication has been established. He sends an
urgent appeal for a relieving force, and is apparently very hard pressed. Seymour says the lega

SEYMOUR flPPEflLS FOR RELIEF-
CANNOT KEEP FOREIGN
TROOPS OUT OF CHINA
WASHINGTON, June 26.â The six great
Viceroys of China, acting through the
Chinese Minister here, to-day renewed
their efforts to have foreign troops kept
out of China until L.1 Hung Chang reaches
Peking. The request was a. formal docu
ment signed by the six Viceroys, includ
ing LI Hung Chang.
The answer of the United States Gov
ernment was the same as that to the in
formal request of Minister \Vu yesterday
and amounted to a declination.
Like his chief. General Miles, Gen eral Chaffee won his present rank by
merit, like him rising from the ranks to a hlgh'command. General Chaffee
was born In Ohio April 14, 1S4S, and began his military service in July. 1S6I.
when he enlisted In the regular army as a private in the Sixth United
States Cavalry. For gallant and meritorious conduct he was made sergeant
and then on up" through the intermediate grades until he was commissioned
captain for his services In the battle of Dinwiddie. March 31, 1SS5.
The Indian campaigns from 1S67 to 1SS2 broughthim up to lieutenant col
onel. He went- to Cuba- with General Shafter and/ commanded a brigade of
the American forces at Santiago, especially distinguishing himself in the cap
ture of "El Caney," which practically ended the siege of Santiago. He was
recommended for special distinction by General Lawton. On May 8, 1SS9, he
was made colonel of the Eighth Cavalry, and about the same time commis
sioned brigadier general of volunteers. Soon after he was made major gen
eral of volunteers. -From December, 1S98, until a short tlrr.e ago General Chaf
fee served as chief of staff, to the Governor General of Cuba, and later In the
office of the adjutant general at Washington.
mour, twelve miles from Tientsin, where
they were surrounded by Boxers and
Chinese regulars. | It is^ thought probable
that this dispatch may' be correct, how
ever, as It agrees with Admiral Kempff's
dispatch in- every particular, except that
it conveys additional Information as to
the whereabout of the Ministers. The au
thorities here believe that when the relief
forces, -which, reached Tientsin on the 23d
and then started, on the 24th to the re
lief of Vice Admiral Seymour reach that
officer,- the | forces will be combined, and
unless it should prove true that the Min
isters and other foreigners are with Vice
Admiral Seymour, an advance by the
combined forces upon Peking will be com
menced at once. >;;')*
May Be Held as Hostages.
It is hoped. here that the 4000 Russians
who left Xluchwang may have reached
Peking by this time, but it is believed that
if they had the Russian Government
would have been notified and would have
Informed the other s Governments. The
general belief here among officers of the
administration and members of the dip
lomatic corps is that if the Ministers and
legation officials are not safe with Vico
Admiral Seymour, they are probably be
ing held ; as hostages by the Chinese, as
was done in 1860 when the Anglo-French
forces intervened In China to protect for
eign life and property.
Adequate supplies of arms and ammuni
tion are being sent to the naval force3 in
Chinese -waters. Rear Admiral- O'Neil,
Chief of the Bureau, of Ordnance, has
been notified of the arrival of 300 tons of
ammunition at Cavite. This will be ample
for the .present, but the admiral Is ar
ranging to send small arms and small
arm ammunition and rapid-fire guns with
ammunition for them by colliers now be
ing fitted out for service In Chinese
waters.
"While every effort will bÂ« made to
strengthen the land forces in China, It
was decided at the Cabinet meeting to
day that no ships were needed and the
Marietta, which was to have gone to
Taku, will be ordered to return from Ma ;
nila to her station at Cebu. The Prince
ton Is to visit ports in Southern China.
Including Swatow and Amoy, and Is to
go to Shanghai for repairs, but is to be
kept In constant readiness for orders to
go to any point in China.

LTON. June 25.â President McKinley

the rulers of European nations and
Japan, have been carefully study

to establish by international pact the prin

Until Peking is taken by the allied forces
it will not be necessary to play even a
minor card.
But when Peking Is captured and the
discussion begins as to the future of China
It will be necessary for the President,
mindful of discordant ideas as to the em

Change of I>ynasty Certain.
One thing is plain to every official and
diplomat in Washingtonâ a change is cer
tain in the reigning dynasty <*f China. The
message of the Viceroys is accepted m of
ficial circles as a confession that China Is
unable under the present Government to
maintain order. Accordingly there la now
but one thing to do, to establish a Govern
ment which can and will govern the Chi
nese people. A proposition is likely to be
made by the United States. Great Britain
or Japan when the allied troops occupy
Peking that a Government satisfactory
to the Chinese shall be organized.
It Is possible that before this stage Is
reached Russia will Inform the powers
that in view of her territorial proximity
to Peking she Is of the opinion that her
troops should garrison the capital and po,
lice Northern China. Such suggestion
would doubtless be strenuously opposed
by Japan and Great Britain. It Is also
possible that the Governments favoring a
partition of China will propose a division
of the empire into spheres, which they
will occupy with their troops.
The United States In Us present temper
could not agree to the occupation of such
a sphere, even if a failure to do so should
mean that American commerce would be
partially excluded by tariff barriers.

LONDON, June 27, 3:45 a. m.â A fresh phase of the ebullition in China is the probability of
immediate outbreaks in the great southern provincial centers. The populace there is daily
assuming a more hostile attitude toward foreigners; and the latter perceive symptoms of a
general rising, especially at Nanking, where, according to a dispatch to the Daily Express,
dated yesterday. Kang \Vu. one of the most truculent enemies of foreigners, has arrived by way of
the Grand Canal, armed with full powers from the Empress to deal with the southern provinces.
The friendly attitude of Viceroy Liu Kun Yih toward foreigners has brought him into disgrace with
Prince Taun. president of the Tstmg-lr Yamenr
The unrest at Canton is described by a dispatch from that city to the Daily Telegraph, dated
Monday, via Hongkong, yesterday:
"It is feared that we are on the eve of a scene of bloodshed and anarchy in the two Quangs
only paralleled during the Tai-Ping rebellion. The signs of a murderous uprising are so manifest
that wealthy Chinese are hurrying from Canton and vicinity, taking their wives, families and valu
bles. Li Hung Chang has again been peremptorily ordered to Peking. His enemies declare
that they will murder him before he can reach there. His presence alone restrains the revolution
ary elements here. His departure will let loose the 'black flags' and 'red girdles.' Knowing this,
Li's trusted officials are sending their families to Hongkong.
"The Viceroy himself trusts the Americans in this crisis. He says that they alone want no
territory, and he places himself largely â almost unreservedly; â in their hands. At an important con
ference to-day he reiterated +his statement. All the missionaries have been notified of their im
minent peril through confidential runners. They are leaving Canton hurriedly, and only a few are
now here.
"Commander McLean, of the United States steamship Don Juan de Austria, is the first here
to protect foreign interests. He is capable and energetic and is reinforced by H. M. S . Redpote.
Two hundred foreign residents at Shameen are armed.
'The Canton population reaches 2.coo.oco, in addition to 250,000 living on junks and sam
pans (fiatboats). Most of the people are disaffected and incendiary proclamations are increasing
the number of the virulent."
Shanghai cables that the French Consul there has received a cable from Shantung assert
ing that 11.000 Chinese troops are making forced marches froni Shantung to Peking.
Two Jesuit fathers and ioo native Christians have been murdered in the southern part of the
province of Chili. The Chinese military authorities have been discovered recruiting at Shanghai
inside the foreign settlement and some agents have been arrested in the act of constructing en
trenchments around the European concessions. . â¢
A Chinaman connected with war purchases for the Chinese Government in Europe, who
has been interviewed by the Daily Express, says that China has immense quantities of arms and am
munition and will stagger humanity if driven to defend herself.

LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON". June 2Câ Brigadier General
Adna R. Chaffee. who has been as
signed to command the American
land forces in China, Is to be given all the
soldiers he may need to protect the lives
and property of Americans. At present
arrangements are being made for sending
a brigade from the Philippines and the
Sixth Cavalry from the United States,
but a cablegram was sent to-day to Ma
jor General MacArthur, commanding the
forces In the Philippines, asking him how
many of his troops he could spare for
service in China. The purpose of this in
quiry is to ascertain how many reinforce
ments can be sent to General Chaffee if
a single brigade is not sufficient.
General Chaffee was at the War Depart
ment to-day and was gi% r en his instruc
tions, after which he called on the Presi
dent and also had consultations with Sec
retary of the Navy Long and Assistant
Secretary of War Melklejohn. He is to
sail from San Francisco on July 1 on the
same transport carrying the Sixth Cav
alry. The desire to have General Chaffee
and this cavalry regiment reach , China
with little delay is such that the trans
port will not stop at Honolulu, but will
continue on her way direct to Nagasaki,
Japan. At that point General Chaffee will
be in communication Â¦with the War De
partment and will receive further instruc
tions. If the trouble is all over so that
troops will not be needed the transport
will go from Nagasaki to Manila. If the
situation has not improved General Chaf
fee, under his, present instructions, will
assume command of ail American land
forces and will act In conjunction with*
the military forces of other powers for
the protection of life and property cf
foreigners, in China, He Is to report to
the American Minister in Peking as soon
as he can place himself in communication
with that official.
Hall Second in Command.
In military operations General Chaffee
will be supreme. In all other matters he
Â¦will act under the direction of Minister
Conger, if the Minister is safe. It was
the first Intention of the War Department
to place Brigadier; General R. H. Hall .n
command in the brigade to be sent from
the Philippines, but it has since been de
termined to send General Chaffee. It is
still probable that General Hail will go
in command of the troops until General
Chaffee's arrival, and he may continue as
second In command.
Tientsin has been relieved by the com
bined forces, but Peking is still cut oft

t . Board. ," ;" ~
The teachers of the public schools were
not paid their salaries yesterday owing
to the failure of the. Board of Kducation
to sign their demands. A few days ago
Auditor Wells wrote a letter to the board
requesting that the demands be signed so
the teachers could receive their salaries
before the end of the month.
The board did not comply with thÂ« re
quest. It claims that it could not spare
the time, as it was engaped in passing
on samples for school supplies. The local
pedagopues are sadly disappointed, as now
they will have to wait until : the regular
day of payment, July 5. The fact- that
vacation days intervene makes the, disap
pointment all the greater.
TEACHERS MUST WAtf

Further steps were taken toward the
proposed building of a cycle path between
this city and Ean MatÂ«Â»o at a meeting of
wheelmen held in the Cycle Board of

evening, and the project Is now well
Btarted.
The finance committee reported that
they had estimated the expense at $10,000
and that the outlook for Â»<x;urins this
amount was good. The cycle trade will
contribute liberally, many individual
wheelmen will add to the fund and John
Hammersmith has agreed to Ret up an en

it materially.

The only route left to consider, therefore,
Is an extension of Dewey boulevard or the

stay for this sum. The position of siÂ»
pprintendent at $200 a month- was created
yesterday, and Dr. V. O. Prior, who has
had much experience with the disease,
was appointed to fill the place. There is
but one case now.
The board adjourned to meet next Fri
day night, when six assistant emerg
ency surgeons and several other employes
are shUed for dismissal. This action is
necessary because the appropriation for
annual salaries was reduced by the Su
pervisors from $32,000 to $24,000.
â¢Jp^ATRICK REDDY's sufferings were
y^J) relieved by the peaceful hard of
jj, death yesterday. He passed quietly
away at his residence. 2717 Pacific
avenue, at 6:15 o'clock, surrounded by
those dear to him.
For the past month he had beon con
fined to his lK-d by pneumonia and Br-ght's
disease and his physicians gave little hope
for his recovery. Dr. Albert Abrams and
Dr. H. C. Sawyer were constantly at his
bedside and they did all that science could
do to save their patient's life, but their
efforts were unavailing. His advanced age
and the ravages of the disease made his
recovery impossible. The news of his
death will be zecelved with sincere regret
l>y the bench and bar and his innumerable
friends.
"Pat" Reddy. as he was often called by
his friends and associates, was probably
one of the best known and most popular
lawyers in the West. He was the senior
xnember cf the well-known firm of Ready.
Campbell & Metson. His rise to promin
ence in his profession and his position in
the community was due wholly to his in
dividual efforts. He was a. self-made man
In every sense of the term. Deceased was
a native of Woonsocket. R. I., where he
was born February 15, 1SS3. His parents
were natives of Ireland. He received his
education in his native State, and in Feb
ruary. ]SG1. came to the Pacific Coast and
engaged in mining. He subsequently
Ftudied law in Inyo County and was ad
mitted to the bar In May. 1S67. engaging
in the practice of his profession there un
til April, 1X79. when he removed to Bodie.
He resided in that famous mining town
until 1S81, whtn he opened an office In this
citv.
Mr. Reddy was a member of the con
stitutional convention, representing Inyo
and Mono counties. In 1S5S3 he was elected
to the State Serate as the representative
of Mono, Inyo, Kern. Tulare anJ Fresno
counties. He looked after the interests of
that important district for four years and
earned the gratitude of the residents of
those counties. He was appointed a mem
ber of the Board of State Prison Directors
In 1SS3. but had to resign that position the
following year because of his increasing
law practice. His business, however, did
not prevent him investing in mining en
terprises. He became part owner in a
riurnber of paying mines and was one of
the original owners of thej Yellow Aster
mine, the farawis pi^ep cf property which
made the reputation of Randsburg. It is
understood he sold his interest In the mine
lor a larpe sum of money.
Mr. ReUdy was interested as counsel in
some of the most important litigation in
the history of this State. As a criminal
lawyer his name has been heralded
throughout the West for his successes. He
â¢won the gratitude of th*Â» miners of the
Coeur d'Alene district by his effortB In
their behalf and his graphic letters to The
Call, in which he dpscribed the harsh
treatment of thp miners by the mine own
ers and the troops, the horrors of the
"bullpen" and the moves of the wily poli
ticians of Idaho created widespread com
ment-
Deceased leaves a wife but no chil
dren. He was married in Esmoralda
County, Xcvada. in 1S64, to Miss Emma
lage, and they have lived a most happy
life together. Captain E. A. Reddy, su
perintendent of the Almshouse. is an only
brother. J. C. Campbell and William H.
Metson. his law partners, are both out of
the city. Mr. Campbell Is engaged In the
trial of a case at Eureka and Mr. Metson
Is now in Nome on business for the firm.
Both will be immediately notified of their
colleague's death.
During the hearing of the contempt case
again.Â«t Federal Quarantine Officer Kin
youn yesterday James G. Maguire an
nounced the death of Hon. Patrick Reddy,
and moved that I'nited States Circuit
Judge Morrow adjourn the court out of
respect to his memory. Mr. Maguire paid
a feeling tribute to the worth of the de
ceased lawyer. Judge Morrow said that
the court was entirely in accord with what
Mr. Maguire had said In respect to the
sterling worth of Mr. Reddy. "He always
observed the requirements of the profe's-
Fion in endeavoring to assist the court in
arriving at the truth. His death is a great
loss to the bar," said Judge Morrow, and
tn^n adjourned court out of respect to the
memory of the dead lawyer.
The funeral arrangements have not as
yet been completed, but it is very probable
that the interment will be in Cypress
Lawn Cemetery on Friday afternoon.
REDDY A HERO.
Sacramento.
How He Saved a Woman's Life in
SACRAMEXTO. June 26.â One-armed
Patrick Reddy proved himself a hero at
the postofflce at the noon hour of January
5, 1&97. Accompanied by his stenographer,
he was on his way downtown from the
Supreme Court chamber, when he noticed
a crowd rushing out of the arched en
trance to the postoffice.
"What Is the matter?" aÂ«=ked Reddy, ac
costing one of the panic-stricken throng.
"A man is in there trying to murder a
woman." was the breathless reply. That
was enough for Rfddy. Brushing aside
all Impediments to his progress, he dashed
up the granite steps and into the nost
offlce corridor. The place had been de
serted save for a man and woman. The
man, P. J. Hulsman, In a fury of rage,
was brandishing a cocked revolver and
threatening the life of his sister. Mrs A.
T. Krigbaum, with whom he had been
quarreling over some family matter. The
woman, helpless in her terror, was
expecting the next moment to be her last
whfn Reddy with his one able hand
caught the barrel of the revolver and
pressed his thumb under the hammer in
such a manner that the trigger could not
be .operated. Hulsman, watching his
chance, made a despprate effort to turn
the weapon on Reddy, but the latter with
his one arm not only prevented this but
hPld Hulsman a prisoner until the police
appeared on the scene. Reddy stopped at
a drugstore to have his mangled thumb
dresFed and then continued on down the
street as If nothing unusual had hap
pened.
THE LATE PATRICK REDDY.
Supervisor McCarthy Holds That
Charter Contains Specific Pro
vision Thereon.
Supervisor McCarthy is of the opinion
that under the express provisions of the
charter the pound limits extend to the
county line. He cites section 10 of chap
ter 2, which says that one of the powers
of the Supervisors is "to provide for a
public pound and to make all necessary
rules and regulations in the matter of
animals running at large and for the cus
tody and destruction of the same."
In article I, section 2, of the charter the
boundaries of the city and county of San
Francisco are declared to be those set
forth In section 3950 of the Political Code
of California.
"Thisappears'tome," said McCarthy, "to
settle the controversy existing between
opposing interests on the extension of the
pound lÂ»mits. All legislation contained
in the charter applies to the city and
county in Its entirety and does not govern
any particular section to the exclusion of
another. It then becomes apparent that
the section bearing on the maintenance of
a pound-affects the whole county, and I
believe that the Board of Supervisors has
not the power to district the city for the
operations of the poundmaster. A rea
sonable interpretation of the charter
makes it clear that the entire county
should be under the Jurisdiction of the
poundmaster."
The Joint Committee on Police and
Judiciary, to which the question of ex
tending the limits has been referred, has
not yet made Its report, but it is under
stood that it favors the extension to the
districts known as Lakeview and Ocean
View. Supervisor Reed desires to Intro
duce an ordinance prohibiting the roam
ing of cattle in the streets in outlying sec
tions, which will in a measure relieve the
annoyance to which suburban residents
are subjected.

Peculiar Defense of E. C. Cordell,
Erstwhile Candidate for Justice
â¢ of the Peace.
E. C. Cordell, a teacher in the Business
Evening School, has set up a peculiar de
fense in a suit brought against him by
Mrs. Susie P. Roberts to recover $50 due
on a. promissory note executed by Cordell
in October, 1S96, but since lost by the
complainant. In his answer filed yester
day. Cordell alleges that the action Is
barred by the provisions of the act to pro
mote the purity of elections, but fails to
state exactly how the purity law should
save him from. paying his debts.
Cordell was a candidate for Justice of
the Peace on the Citizens' Republican
ticket, and in her complaint Mrs. Roberts,
who is the wife of A. E. Roberts, a
teachor in the Humboldt Evening School,
alleged that she advanced him $150 in the
interest of his candidacy. She further al
leged that only $100 had been paid back
by Cordell. and she sued for the re
mainder, with interest.
It is likely that the Board of Education
will take a hand in tho controversy, as a
rule was recently passed providing that
all employes of the School Department
must pay their debts under pain of dis
missal. Should Mrs. Roberts" claim be
found just Cordell may be called upon to
explajn.
The suit will be heard by Judge Kerri
gan.

NO MORE SOFT
SNAPS FOR THE
HARBOR POLICE
Their Day's Work of Eight
Hours 'to Cease on
Saturday.
Chief Sullivan Has Ordered That
They Must *Be Placed on the
Same Footing as in Other
The change will necessitate a lieutenant
being assigned to assist Captain Dun
leavy. He has been hitherto without one,
a sergeant performing that duty. It is
expected that if Lieutenant Bennett on
the retired list is reported by the medical
examiners fit for duty he will be assigned
to the harbor district. In any case, when
the headquarters are transferred to the
Hall of Justice Lieutenant Esola will be
out of a Job and the harbor will be open
to him.
The Chief has now decided that on and
after July 1 the men at the harbor station
will be placed on the. same footing as the
men in the other districts and the "soft
snap" is at an end. Captain Dunleavy
was instructed yesterday by the Chief to
make his arrangements so that the new
order would come into effect on July 1.
It is thought that he will require more
men, and if so they will be taken from
some of the other districts, but he waa
asked to so arrange it that no more men
would be necessary.
Unlike other districts in the city, the
officers at the harbor station had only to
serve eight hours each day. They had
eight hours for work, eight hours for
amusement and eight hours for sleep. In
other districts the men have to be on duty
one day twelve hours and the other day
six hours, making eighteen hours in the
two days. But the watches are so ar
ranged that an officer has no time foi
amusement unless he gives up several
hours which should be devoted to sleep.
To get transferred to the harbor district
has always been looked upon In the de
partment as .a sort of promotion, as it
was considered a "soft snap." "When a
vacancy occurred there was as much
wire-pulling as for a promotion as ser
geant, and the man who was assigned to
nil the vacancy was envied by his brother
officers.
Chief Sullivan Issued an order yester
day to take effect July 1 that will cause
consternation among the officers on the
water front, and surprise the force gen
erally. Captain Dunleavy was summoned
to his presence yesterday morning and
was informed of the new order.

AT A BANQUET
JOHN R. AITKEX, THE SAN FRANCISCO ATTORNET, WHO HAS
BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF CONTEMPT OF COURT AT BAKERSFIELD.
BAKERSFIELD, June 2S.-John R. Alt
ken, a prominent attorney of San Fran
cisco, Is in the Kern County jail under
sentence of five days* imprisonme'nt and
a fine of $300 is hanging over h!s head.
He was sent to jail this afternoon by Su
perior Judge Mahon for using the follow
ing language in a brief submitted to the
court:
"If this Is a moot case, as during the
trial the court on several occasions de
clared It to be, then the court should of
its own motion dismiss the proceedings.
"The principle is well established that
courts will not sit to determine abstrac
tions, and will refuse to proceed In a
cause which involves only a right that
has ceased to exist since the action was
commenced.
"The defendants In this case were repre
sented by but one attorney, and plaintiff
by three of the most intelligent, active,
capable and experienced lawyers in Kern
County, If not In the State, who were not
only responsible for but were actively en
gaged in representing and protecting their
side of the case, and the trial should have
been left to them."
Three weeks ago Mr. Altken represent
ed the defendant in the trial of the case
of Palmes vs. Osborn, a suit to quiet title
to some oil land. When the case was con
cluded argument was submitted on brief*.
Since the trial of the case another suit
has grown out of the same contention,
and it appears from the way the latter
suit originated Judge Mahon was wrought
up to say It was a "moot case." During
the trial of the latter suit to-day Judge
Mahon/ during recess, took occasion to
look over Aitken's brief In the. first case
for the first time. It was then he found
the foregoing contemptuous language.
When court convened Judge Mahon thus
addressed himself to Mr. Aitken:
"It appears to me that there has been
a flagrant contempt of this court, and a
citation is now being prepared which will
summon you to appear before this court
to show cause why you should not be pun
ished for contempt.
When adjudged guilty of contempt and
sentenced to five days In jail and a fine of
$o00 AHken and his associates In the case
were dumfoundfd.
Aitken was then marched to jail. To
night his associates are preparing a writ
of habeas corpus to submit to the Supreme
Court. Aitken was at one time Superior
Judge of San Diego County. Many are of

The members of the San Francisco Fly

Horace Smyth, last night at dinner. For
the past eleven months Mr. Smyth has
been touring Europe, drifting wherever
his fancy dictated. His reception was a
flattering one. There were flowers in pro
fusion, music rendered by a string orches
tra and an elaborate menu to be discussed
before the welcoming of the club's guest
was put into words. This pleasant duty
devolved upon President Walter D. Mans
field, who gave Mr. Smyth full credit for
the great services he nad rendered the
club during his < incumbency of the office
of secretary.
Mr. Smyth responded by tracing his
travels up the Nile and telling of the fish
and fisherman he saw. -
Alex T. Vogelsang responded to the
toast of "The Kickers," in which he
touched lightly and humorously on the
foibles of the guest of the evening.
Alfred Sutro responded for the "New

A E Everett rendered several vocal se

present were:

day he went to Perry street, near Third,
seeking for a man named Johnson, and
because he could not find him he as
saulted . James Sheehan. a boy, and Pat
rick Banahan, who went to the boy's as
sistance. He also struck and kicked the
boy's mother. The Judge convicted him
and ordered that a charge of battery be*
also booked against him. He will be sen
tenced to-day.
Assaulted Three People.
A determined effort Is being made by
the residents and property ownersâ and
for that matter all the residents are prop
erty owners â of Kureka Valley for bet
ter school accommodations for their chil
dren. A recent canvass of the valley
made with the object of securing signa
tures for a petition to the Board of Kdu
cation for the erection of a twelve-class
school building resulted in obtaining the
signatures of WX) householders having
children of legal school age. They are
very anxious to have a building In which
their children can be educated without
compelling the little ones to walk a mile
to a school, and then after they get there
to sit two in a seat.
During the past live years the popula
tion in tills valley has Increased one hun
dred fold, until at the present time it is a
little settlement *n itself with thrifty
householders and a large school attend
ance. The only school within one mile
of the eastern batfe of the heights is the
Douglass Primary at Nineteenth and
Colliriffwood streets, which is greatly
overcrowded. During the last school
term the children were compelled to sit
as many as two and three at one desk,
whereas the rules of the department are
that only one pupil shall occupy a desk.
Even in this overcrowded condition -there
were by actual count 150 children of legal
school age who were compelled to remain
at home because there was no place for
them in the school. It is this condition
of affairs that brings the heads of fam
ilies to the front with a loud and long
complaint for a proper school building in
which their children, can receive that to
which they are entitled, a public school
education. The petition for this new
building has been placed on file by the
Hoard of School Directors, with a prom
ise to give It special consideration.
Next to the necessity of better school
facilities is the want of a buildinp for an
engine and hose cart in order that the
property of the people, may have protec
tion against fire. The distance and the
scarcity of fire hydrants renders any at
tempt to extinguish a conflagration futile.

INCREASING THETB LEAD.
West End Club to Give a Ball.
The first grand ball under the auspices
of the "West End Club will be held at
B'nal B'rith Hall, 121 Eddy street. Satur
day evening next. Ladles will be admit
ted free. ; .
THE promoters of coursing have come
together and entered into an agree
ment similar to that which exists
bet-ween the horse-racing associa
tions in this district. In brief, the director
ates of Ingleside Coursing Park and of
Union Coursing Park have decided to hold
alternate meetings, only one park to be
in operation at a time. As Union Park's
representatives were In a position to dic
tate terms, that field will be open four
weeks to three weeks for Ingleside. There
will be no coursing at the latter park
until July 25, when its gates will be re
opened, and coursing will be promoted
there until August 12, when Union Park
will again take up the sport. Each park
will retain Its present field officials and
employes. Union Park will continue
without Interruption until July 25, and
efforts will be made to prepare a pro
gramme which will appeal strongly to
all persons interested in coursing.
The negotiations which resulted in this
radical departure In the promotion of
coursing on this coast have been pending 1
for some time. The representatives of
Ingleside Park took the Initiative in the
matter, making the first overtures to the
Union Park management. The most diffi
cult matter in connection with the change
was that of a fair division of dates. This
being settled, the other details were
quickly agreed upon.
One of the first moves under the new ar
rangement will be the doing away with
the free gate, which obtains at the pres
ent time. This will not go into effect un-
til next week in order that due notice may
be given. A $5 entrance fee will be
charged and the added money increased
so that the prizes will all be larger than
those now paid. It Is Intended to weed
out the dogs that are not able to per
form creditably on the coursing field, thus
making It unprofitable for men to breed
or train them for the sport.
To accommodate the dogs which are not
of the highest quality, one and possibly
two stakes may be run during the week,
giving at least three and possibly four
days' sport.
' The second meeting of the Ingleside
Club will commence about October 1,
when the management expects to have its
new park, just across the county line, in
readiness. In the meantime, should any
adverse legislation or decision of the
courts take from the Ingleside Coursing
Club the privileges it now enjoys, the
agreement becomes void.
The usual midweek stake will be run
to-day at Union Park. The coursing
train will leave at 11 a. m. The first draw
of Union Park under the new arrange
ment will be held to-night.
The coursing men with the best grey
hounds will, apparently, be benefited by
the merging of the Interests of the twb
parks. There seems a genuine desire on
the part of the management of both to In
crease the prizes to such a point as the
profits wiirpermlt, leaving a fair margin
of profit for the promoters. The owners
of poor dogs will find their opportunities
for coursing- limited, as the park manage
ment will be In a position to decline en
tries of dogs who are not able to win a
course.

CROWLEY NO LONGER A
BOXING CLUB MANAGER
Dan Crowley, the well-known sporting
man. is no longer manager of the Colum
bia Athletic Club. He has been super
seded by "William J. Kennedy, ex-super
intendent of the Olympic Club. This move
on the part of the board of directors of
the Columbia organization will create a
sensation In sporting circles. Crowley has
been to the front since the organiza-tlon of
the club of which he was the head and
has arranged all the bouts which have
been fought under Its auspices.
Dt'ring the past week some ugly rumors
have been afloat regarding Crowley's
management of the corporation, and as
he was not present to defend himself, bis
friends tried to refute the stories as best
they could. The continued absence of
Crowley and the appointment of Kennedy
as his successor lend some colo'r to tho
stories that have been current in sport
dom.
It is stated that Crowley has been lax
In his business methods and has not mado
an accounting to Dr. Drucker, Charles S.
Kapp and Messrs. Epptnger and McGin
ley of the receipts and expenditures of the
Nelll-Moffatt fight, which took place at
Woodward's Pavilion under the sanction
of the Columbia Club. Crowley had been
asked repeatedly to attend a meeting oi
the directors, but has up to this tlma
failed to do so. One of the directors stat
ed yesterday that there were a number of
bills against the club which were unpala.
although the erstwhile manager had been
given the money to pay the same. Two ot
the directors are Incensed at the peculiar
manner In which Crowley transacts busi
ness and they are tn favor of Instituting
legal proceedings against him for an ac
counting 1 .

CALIFORNIA HORSES
WON NUMEROUS PURSES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, June 26.â The race meeting
.closed here yesterday. It being a post
poned day the management offered a free
gate as an attraction. Even Â¦with this
strong Inducement only a fair crow-1
viewed the harness and running events.
This can be attributed almost entirely to
the syndicate style of betting. The gro
tesqueness of the prices laid bordered on
the absurd, 103 per cent books being aa
common as honeybees on an orange blos
som. Next year a complete reformation
is promised under an entirely new man
agement.
The California horsemen and riders par
ticipating at the meeting more than held
their own. "Billy" Randall won more
than half a dozen purses Â¦with Midlove,
Gauntlet and Panamint. but the books
held his horses at such ridiculously low
odds that he laid away but little outside
of the purses. He refused an offer of
J1000 for Gauntlet from the Texas rider,
Jones. The Montana turfman will ship
his horses back to Sacramento and will
then pay a visit to his Great Falls home.
Frank McMahon will rest Alarla and
Croker at this point while he Journeys on
to Saratoga to give the Eastern ring u
rattle. Frank did not win many purses,
but he was down good and thick when
Alarla did score.
Morton and McArthur are as yet un
decided whether to return to California
or make the St. Louis trip. Game Warden
is still on the sick list and will need quite
a let-up. Harry Finton. owner of Ter
rene, will ship to St. Louis, where he
hopes to annex a purse or two.
McDonald, the coast rider, outclassed
the other riders shoes to plate with eight
een firsts, five seconds, three thirds and
only eight unplaced mounts to his credit.
His piloting of horses, even at this mixed
meeting, was above reproach. Bozeman
could land but a single winner, his habits
being against Buccess. "Chub" Russe'l
reached the wire first on five and Fauntlr>
roy on two horses. The Texas rider.
Jones, owner of R, Q. Ban, was second on
the list with ten winning mounts. Mc-
Donald will return to California, the Turf
Congress still refusing to issue him a
license. _
The attendance throughout at Overland
Park has been good, but from a financial
standpoint the promoters about broke
even. Gavin & Co.. the bookmakers, got
out the last three days. The judging In
both the trotting and running events was
performed by P. E. Mulholland of San
Francisco to the entire satisfaction of
local and visiting turfmen. On the closing
day P. F. Regan occupied the starters
box and his work was of the highest class.
hanging on he managed to stay the round.
Fifteenth round â Tom was up first. He
closed, but Gus rent him away with short
left and right jolts on the head. Tom
looked tired and Gus followed him and
jabbed his head back and crossed his right
to the jaw. Tom staggered and Ruhlin
stepped in and banged him with both
hands until the sailor staggered to the
floor. He was up at the count but unable
to make a defense, and again he went to
the carpet from Ruhlin's blows. With
bulldog gameness he again struggled to
his feet. Gus by this time was hardly
able to use his hands. When Tom again
regained his teet Gus staggered to the
game sailor and sent short lefts and rights
to the head that looked as if they would
not hurt a child, but Tom was so badly
done up that he again went down under
them. Again he rose blindly to his feet,
and Gus walked to him. Tom tried to
clinch, but Gus stepped back and put a
straight left to the face and a right Up
percut on the jaw. Tom then toppled
forward all nut. and Referee Johnny
White waved Rrhlin to his corner, while
the sailor pugilist's seconds carried him
to his corner, where he gradually revived
and soon was able to leave the ring.
Victor and Vanquished.
When seen In his dressing-room Ruhlin
acted like a big child.
"Well, what did you think of It?" was
his greeting to the interviewers. "Didn't
I do all right? I'm a big, slow fellow and
can't fight, maybe, but I won didn't I?
Tom is a tough, game fellow and gave
me a good fight, but I had not any doubt
as to the ending. I'm not hurt and feel
fine and whatever Billy Madden says goes
with me. If he wants me to fight, I'll
fight, I don't care who."
His manager. Billy Madden, said: "Well,
we're now ready for Mr. Jeffries and hope
he will come to time without delay. I
think I have the champion and will make
a match as soon as Jeffries signifies a
willingness."
Sharkey was much downhearted, but
eaid he had no excuses to make. He is
willing to meet his conqueror again and
has $10,000 to bet he would win.
"Jim" Corbett was highly elated over
Ruhlin's victory. He said Jeffries had
done a lot of talking lately and will now
have to make good his bluff or quit.
then took a hand and Jabbed his left hard
to the face and followed with his right.
Tom steadied himself and worked both
hands to the body, and Gus landed left
and right to the head. The fighting was
remarkably fast for big men and the
crowd was cheering wildly.
Third roundâ Tom rushed and Gus met
him with both hands to the head. "Hook
low and wallop:" yelled O'Rourke, but
Tom was mad, and again rushed wildly.
Gus slammed him with both hands, but
cculd not keep him off. Tom then drove
both hands to the body and Gus coun
tered with his left to the head. Tom
dropped to escape punishment. He was
right un, only to get both hands on the
face and head from Gus. Tom was bleed
ing at the nose when the bell rang, and
both were tired.
Fourth round â Gus danced about when
Tom rushed, but when Tom closed plant
ed a hard right on the sailor's body. They
then mixed in Sharkey's corner. Gus was
very tired, and Tom was little better.
Tom rushed and jabbed his left to the
face. He repeated the blow and Gus sent
him away with both hands to the body.
The round was much slower than the pre
ceding ones, and both were glad to heai
the bell.
Some Hard Slogging-.
Fifth roundâ Tom was first on his feet
and, meeting Gus in the center, planted
his left to the body and swung his right
to the Jaw. Again he landed the sam<s
punches and Gus countered with a right
jolt on the body. Both roughed it on the
ropes. Gus shot a straight right to the
face and Tom rushed him across the ring
and landed a right behind the ear. Gus
jabbed back, but was verv tired, and Tom
banged him with hard rights to the body
and both hands to the head. Gus was
staggering when the bell rang.
Sixth round â Tom rushed and hooked
his left to the jaw and Gus jabbed his
left, cutting Tom's right eye. Tom was
wild and rushed and swung his right
heavily to Ruhlin's jaw. They mixed it
up hard, both landing left and right
swings to the head at close quarters.
Tom hooked his left to the jaw and Gus
crossed with his right, sending Tom back,
and followed with a hard left to the wind.
Both again landed both hands to the facÂ«
and were mixing It at the bell.
Seventh roundâ Tom rushed and swung
his left to the jaw. They clinched and
broke Â¦without a punch, and Gus Jabbed
his left to the face. Tom again rushed
and they clinched. Tom Jabbed his left to
the head and Ruhlin cent him away with
one of the same kind. Sharkey landed a
right on the body and Gus uppercut his
left to the face and then swung his right
to the Jaw. He repeated the trick, and,
ducking Tom's swings, drove his right to
the body as the bell rar.gr. Both were now
very tired.
Eighth roundâ Tom rushed again and
Jolted his right to the body. Gus closed
and landed left and right to the face.
Tom was still aggressive and rushed Gus
about the ring. Again Gus Jabbed and fol
lowed with a right across the jaw. Tom
rushed, only to take a left to the face and
a right on the jaw. Tom staggered and
Gus rushed and banged him with both
hands to the jaw, and Tom went to the
floor, taking the count and getting to his
feet only as the bell rang.
Sharkey Badly Punished.
Ninth roundâ Tom rushed and Gus met
him with a straight left to the face that
Jarred him. Tom swung wildly, but his
blows landed around the neck, and Cius
planted both hands to the body. Tom
still came on, but Gus measured him and
sent a crashing right to the jaw. He
could not keep the sailor away, but every
time he came Gus was ready for him and
sent right and left to the head with telling
effect. Gus looked the best at the bell.
Tenth round â Gus stood in his corner in
a crouching position, and when Tom
came in sent him back with a short right
on the jaw. Tom rushed back and sent
a terrific left to the body. He tried to re
peat the blow, but Gus blocked It and
sent back a left to the head. Gus mixed
It with him, and Tom made him wabble

throughout the building, but the sailor
was good yet and was rushing again

SEASIDE ATHLETIC CLUB, CON*ET
ISLAND. June 26.â For the first time
la his pugilistic career Tom Sharkey
Â¦went down to decisive defeat to
night In the historic arena of the
Seaside Athletic Club, and big Gus Ruh
lin, the Ohio pugilist, was his conqueror.
It was a clean knockout alter fifteen
rounds of fighting that made a memor
able rir.g battle. Save in the matter of
aggressiveness. Ruhlin led from the start
oSC in every feature of the game, and at
all times had the fight well In hand.
Sharkey did not give up his place in the
line cf first-class heavyweights without
a determined struggle. No soldier ever
gave more desperate battle; no man
sinking to unconsciousness ever clung
more determinedly to his vitality. Even
at the end. when blinded by the blows of
his powerful opponent and dulled mental
ly by the battering of his foe, he clung
Instinctively to the massive frame of the
ir.an who was his master.
The decisive battle and unexpected re
rult were truly a surprise for the sporting
public. No line of form that could be
figured gave the Ohioan more than a 1
to 2 char.ee. Sharkey had met and at
least stood off all of the leading heavy
weights row in the ring. He was known
to be a giant in strength, courageous to
a point beyond discretion and aggressive.
Ruhlin, on the other hand, had never
made a particularly good showing against
any man of reputation and was regarded
as a ec-cend rater. Hence there was
apathy as to the fight, and while there
was some spirited betting, Ruhlin never
showed better than 10 to 7. and it was
even money that he would not last ten
rounds. Tne management, in fact. In
tended to put the general admission down
to JL There was a big cro*'d on hand,
liuwex-er, and it was treated to a rattling
good fight, with surprising results.
Sharkey an Odds-On Choice.
ci-.arkey was the first maji to come, and
it was l&:06 p. m. when he appeared. The
Impatient crowd gave him a fair volley
cf applause and was not especially enthu
6iÂ£Â£uc when Ruhlin came in a minute
later. Ruhiia showed to great advantage
from a spectator'6 viewpoint when the
men Etooa up together. He had height
and weight and reach and looked big and
muscular. His condition seemed perfect
and his work as the battle progressed
showed that it was. Sharkey was not
lacking In the matter of condition either,
and that cannot be urged In explanation
or extenuation. At 10:lo o'clock, when the
men, answering the gong, came to the
center, speculators went through the
crowd offering 2 to 1 on Sharkey. At these
rigures there was a heavy play and the
tsifiKt. did the paying.
A? the men eparred for an opening it
could be Eeen that Gus showed improved
footwork and greater cleverness in avoid
ing punishment. Ability In that respect,
coupled with his natural advantages, gave
him a superiority which he never waived.
He also showed fierce punishing power
and It was only Sharkey's superb vitality
that kept him from defeat earlier in the
battle. He used his right and left with
equal facility and made them both count.
lie rather lacked in aggressiveness, and
if he had gone in could have finished the
battle much earlier than he did. He al
lowed Sharkey to make the pace, and
although he met him determinedly enough
when he came in he did not press all of
Ills advantages. He used his right to ex
cellent advantage and time and again
stepped in after the chunkey Irishman
had swung at him and made his blow

Bunlin'6 Telling Blows.
He had met oil master, however, and
defeat, though slow, was inevitable.
Each round brought him closer to it.
Ruhlin kept away from his wild swings
and desperate leads and kept hammering
his left and right to the face and body.
He cut the sailor's face until it was
bathed in blood, and marked his chest
and sides where he planted his powerful
punches. They clashed In desperate
clinches and were broken time and again.
Sharkey Bhowed an inclination to rough
It and wrestle In the clinches, and the un-
Evmpathetic crowd hissed and hooted at
him. Cries of "Foul:" rang from the
crowd, but the referee refused to inter

the jaw with his left. Ruhlin sprang in
and beat the Irishman down to the floor
with a volley of punches. The resolute
fighter struggled to his feet. and. when
Ruhlin came In-, clutched him around the
waist. Ruhlin shook him off and dropped
him again. A thousand men. frenzied in
tiieir excitement, surrounded the ring
and there was a din of hoarse yells.

Etapgcfed against the ropes. Ruhlin
peemed unable to finish him, and that

RDHLIN IN THE FIFTEENTH RODND
CHICAGO, June 26.â More than 6000 peo
ple saw the racing to-day at Washington
Park. The track was fast and the weather
warm. The stake event â the Lakeside,
for two-year-oldsâ brought out a meeting
between Miss Bennett of Memphis and
Sofala of California, the stars of their re
spective sections. They opened at 3 to 5
each. Sofala was backed to 9 to 10, while
Miss Bennett advanced to 3 to 1. Miss
Bennett won easily. Tenny Bell made the
early pace and Miss Bennett lay in a good
position to the stretch, where she drew

A BAD BEATING
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI/L, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 27, 1900.
The National Athletic Club has
matched Willie Cole to box Tommy Cox
twenty rounds as a preliminary to the
Neill-Moffatt fight which is to be held on
the evening of July 13 in Mechanics* Pa
vilion. The lads will weigh in at 127
pounds at 6 o'clock on the evening of
their meeting.
Cox is a late arrival from the Antipodes
and comes with a long list of victories to
his credit. He was tried out at the San
Francisco Athletic Club a few weeks ago
and did so well that the managers of the
local club saw, fit to give him a chance of
displaying his mettle in public. Cox is
said to be the champion feather-weight
of Australia. He is powerfully built for
his size and weight and is as shifty as a
kangaroo on his feet. Willie Cole is well
known to local ring-goers. The splendid
AUSTRALIAN CHAMPION
TO BOX IN THIS CITY
fight he put up against Toby Irwln a few
weeks back stamps him as being an op
ponent to be feared by men in his class
To-morrow evening the amateur "slog
gers" will hold sway In the rooms of the
San Francisco Athletic Club. Alec Greg
gains, referee, manager and general util
ity man. has arranged a good card for the
occasion. George Flnnigan will go four
rounds with Joe Hill at 105 pounds; Pat
Dugan will go the same distance with
Jack Hart at 115 pounds; T. Sullivan will
meet J. O'Leary at 115 pounds;. Ed Kinur
and J. Spooner will try conclusions at 12)
pounds; Jack Harrigan and Frank Wall
will battle at 12S pounds; X. Bacigalupl
and J. . Brady .will box at 129 pounds; J
J. Phipps and Gus Salsbury will meet at
140 pounds, and Frank Nlcholls will battle
with Burt Omlnes at 160 pounds.

MARKET STREET, Entire Upper Floor, Cor. 6th Street |The racetrack began the local career of a young
soldier visitor not long ago, and a determined effort
at suicide has closed it. San .Franciscans are fa
miliar with such causes and effects.
After the bubonic scare there ought to be a general
clean-up, including: the Board of Health, the Federal
cuarantine office and Chinatown.
Dr. Kinyoun, the discredited quarantine officer, in
sists that he is not responsible for the mistakes of
transportation companies. He probably, thinks that
he has more than a load to carry in his own multi
tude of offenses and he is probably right. -
The lecturer who has reached a very firm convic

able to tell something interesting of the character of
the company he has kept since he came among us.

THE CHINATOWN PROBLEM.
QUARANTINE irritations no longer trouble
us, Kinyounism has been suppressed for a
time at least, and the bubonic Board of
Health has taken to cover. We may drop each and
aJl of them from further discussion if we choose, but
we should not drop the memory of the lesson the
quarantine has taught It was the unsanitary condi
tion of Chinatown that gave to the Board of Health
and to Kjnyoun the opportunity to make their at
tacks upon the city, and so ldng as Chinatown re
mains in such condition we will not be safe from a
repetition of the offense. The cleaning of China
town has. in fact, become an emergency measure,
and should be undertaken at once.
We have already pointed out the duty of the Grand
Jury to investigate the extent to which the health
ordinances of the city have been violated by the
pwr.ers of property in the Chinese quarter. It is not
like!y the jury' will neglect the opportunity for ren
dering an important service to the community. The
one danger is that there may be a strong opposition
to whatever is done in the direction of reform, and
that the opposition may endeavor to force a com
promise in the way of a consent on the part of the
authorities to a partial obedience to the sanitary or
dinances, instead of having them enforced in the Chi
nese quarter as rigidly as in any other part of th
city.
It goes without argument that no compromise
should be accepted. Every ordinance of the city
should be enforced on Chinatown as strictly as else
where- In no other section is a strict adherence to
sanitary regulations so important as in that locality,
for it is there that there is most danger of disease
and pestilence. The property-owners of Chinatown
are among the richest men in San Francisco. They
can well afford to put their buildings in order and
obey the laws. They should be compelled to do so.
The bubonic hoard has neglected to enforce the health
ordinances. Let the Grand Jury get to work.
DISPATCHES from Shanghai announce that
the forces of the so-called insurgents in Chinu
are under command of Prince Tuan and
that on the .morning of June 21 he attacked the for
eign settlement at Tientsin "with artillery and the
best foreign drilled troops." We have here an illus
tration of what comes of drilling Chinese in the
methods and arms of civilization and of what they
can do when so trained.
When the British and the French invaded Chin.i in
the last generation they met scarcely any resistance
on the march. Even when the Japanese but a few
years ago attacked China they found it easy to defeat
any force the Chinese brought against them. Now a
considerable force of Americans, British, French,
Russians and Japanese has been held at bay for weeks
by a force that represents nothing "more than an in
surrection in China and the reason for it is that the
Chinese this time not only have artillery, but have
it in the hands of foreign-drilled troops.
Of course, the relief of Tientsin will not be long de
layed. In a comparatively short time the allied
armies will scatter the forces of Prince Tuan and
march to Peking and there dictate such terms of peace
as their rivalries will enable them to decide upon.
There are not enough foreign-drilled Chinese to make
a long resistance, nor enough of arms and munitions
to enable them to make a persistent fight when once
the capital is taken. The fact remains, however, that
the foreign drilling has made them no mean foe and
that civilization has a new factor to reckon with in
the Chinese problem.
It will be remembered that after the success
achieved by Chinese Gordon had illustrated what can
be done by Chinese when led and trained by Euro
peans, the British formed a body of Chinese troops
for the protection of their posts in China, and two
years ago when they took possession of Wei-Hai-Wei
they organized a regiment of Chino-British troops
and drilled it for police duty. Not long ago an
opportunity was offered for testing the value of the
regiment. A huge mob of Chinese attacked a num
*ber of British officers who were surveying and mark
ing the boundaries of the British district and for a
time it looked as if there would be something like a
massacre. The trained regiment was called out and
responded with prompt obedience and discipline. It
proved itself capable of dealing with a mob of twenty
times its numbers. It fired upon the mob, dispersed
it and fully protected the district entrusted to its
guardianship.
There was a good deal of congratulation in; the
FOREIGN DRILLED CHINESE.
CALlFORiNIA.
New York Herald.
The Native Sons of the Golden "West

celebration of the golden Jubilee of the
admission of the great State of Califor

And every State In the Union "will be In

California has a more unique history than
any other section of the country. It began
Its existence with a tidal wave of human

dropped into chaos and was "confusion

a continuous performance, in which trag

DONNELLY'S HORSE QUESTION
CALIFORNIA Democrats in State convention
adopted a platform this year which is notable
mainly for the fact that it has no silver plank.
New York Democrats adopted a platform declaring
fof the money of Thomas Jefferson. In several other
States similar tactics have been followed and silver
has been either passed without a notice or the free
coinage programme has been dodged. On the other
hand, in many States Democratic conventions have
adopted silver planks so big that forty donkeys can
stand on them, and in nearly all of the States dele
gates to the national convention have been instructed
Such a condition of affairs gives pertinence and
point to the question put by Ignatius Donnelly in his
letter of acceptance of the^nomination for the Vice
Presidency by the stalwart^Populists. In comment
ing upon the absurdity of Populist fusion with Bry
anism and Democracy the Minnesota champion of the
"middle of the road" men and women put to the
voters of the country this query: "If ten horses are
hitched to the front of a cart, and ten horses equally
strong are fastened to the tail end, will not the cart
It will be for the Kansas City convention to give
heed to the horse sense of that question. If Bryan,
free silver and anti-trust be hitched to one end of the
Democratic cart, while Tammany, Jefferson money
and the ice trust be fastened to the tail end, will the
cart move? If it should happen to move, which way
will it move?
The men who framed the .Democratic platform in
this State and put a Hearst plank in place of the silver
plank were doubtless astute men, and no one has ever
called 'Hill and Gorman fools, but the scheme of try
ing to dodge the silver question while nominating
Bryan is but an ostrich wisdom at best. They may
keep free coinage out of the platform to 'be adopted
at Kansas City, but they cannot take it out of Bryan's
record, nor keep it out of his mouth, nor eliminate it
from the minds of the people, nor remove it from the
issues of the campaign.
By hitching a double team to its cart in such a
way that one team pulls from the pole while the other
pulls from the tailboard the Democratic leaders may
fool some people at the start as to the direction in
which the cart is likely to move, but nobody will be
fooled any great length of time. With such pulling
and hauling the old cart will either not move at all
or it will go into the ditch. It is up to Democrats to
answer the shrewd old Populist's horse question.
AFTER THE PEACE CONFERENCE.
SHOULD the Czar of Russia take a notion to
call another peace conference he will not get a
cordial response from any quarter of the globe.
The results of his first effort in that direction are not
encouraging. The conference at The Hague may not
have been a hoodoo, but it certainly was not a mascot,
and nobody is very eager to try another experiment
with the thing.
When the Czar called for the representatives' of the
powers to assemble smoke the peace pipe the
world was in a fairly peaceful condition, and had
been so for many years. It is true there had been a
little, hundred days, one-sided fight between our
selves and Spain, but that had ended to the satisfac
tion of all, and everything was serene. There was
hardly a prospect of battle on the horizon. Even the
good old Turkish war cloud was for a time as dim
as a vanishing mist. The peace conference met and
talked and dined and talked some more. Now look at
the situation. We are fighting the Filipinos, Great
Britain is fighting the Boers and the Ashantis, the
Chinese are fighting everybody, and there is more to
come. France is crowding Morocco, Russia and
Jcpan are lining up for a fight over the possession of
Korea, the United States is getting the war hatchet
ready for Turkey, the Balkan states are growing tur
bulent toward Austria, the Kaiser is equipping a new
naval armament and threatening everything in sight,
and finally the Chinese imbroglio has involved so
many nations that the whole civilized world may be
plunged into the red abyss of slaughter before the
year is over.
Judging by the existing situation it would seem that
peace conferences are like dreams and go by con
traries. Should the Czar desire another conference
it is to be hoped he will call it a war talk, and invite
suggestions as to the advisability of putting all inter
national issues into a pool and fighting them out in a
general scrimmage.
STOCKTON IN HER GLORY.
SEE Stockton and have a halcyon and vociferous
time. That is the programme of the week.
Stockton has held many public festivals and
entertained many a joyous gathering, but never be
fore has she attained to anything like the glory or the
rapt'ure of this occasion. She has painted herself to
the glow of cherry red. blended with the freshness of
apple green, and for every one who visits her while
the festival lasts there will be a democratic welcome to
a roval time.
There are reasons for a good deal of gratification
in the revival this year of the festival spirit of the peo
ple. We have had this spring a succession of "street
fairs," as they are called, which impressively attest
the abounding prosperity of the people of every sec
tion of the State, and the sense of joyous satisfaction
which is felt in it. There is no reflection upon the
preceding fairs in saying that the one now in progress
in Stockton surpasses them all, for Californian enter
prise is such that whoever speaks last or acts last â
tells the last story or arranges the last show â always
sees his predecessor and goes a little bit better. Stock
ton has had the advantage of noting what were the
most successful features at the festivals elsewhere and
has known how to profit by it. Within her streets,
therefore, is to be seen just nefw the best that Califor
nia can do in the way of open air decorations, enter
tainments and frolics.
All San Franciscans who can afford to share in the
fair should do so. It will furnish as pleasant a holi
day as is likely to be obtained anywhere this sum
mer. Cherry red and apple green make a very allur
ing combination, and it is safe to say Stockton will
live up to everything that is suggested by so gor
geous a combination of fruity colors.
THE GEOGRAPHY QUESTION
IS NOT VITAL.
Sacramento Bee.
The Philadelphia North American tele
graphed on Thursday to the editors of the
various prominent newspapers throughout
the United States as to the "logical" run
ning mate for Bryan in view of the nomi
nation of Theodore Koosevelt for Vice
President by the Republican party.
According to a dispatch from Philadel
phia the tabulated answers * show a de
cided preference for David B. Hill, while
William R. Hearst comes in as next
choice.
The running mate for Bryan should be
a man in whom the people have confi
dence. He should be a man like Bryan,
full of principle, with the courage of his
convictionsâ a man believing in the essen
tial doctrines which Bryan has so gal
lantly championed.
Because Koosevelt hails from New-
York is no reason why only a New Yorker
need apply to make the race with Bryan.
Geographical considerations have an un
due weight before conventions, but they
are powerless as an argument Â¦with the
masses, unless to the largely fictitious ad
vantage of latitude and longitude is added
strength of character and devotion to
principle on fho part of the candidate, and
a trust reposed in him "by the people.
It would add no strength to Bryan to
put a New Yorker on the ticket with him,
if that New Yorker is to be either a man
who is not now and never was a crusader
for Bryan principles, out rather an en
emy thereto, or a man who, with all the
work of his papers, could not make him
self acceptable to the voters either in
Now York or the West.
The Bee believes that no stronger can
didate for Vice President could be found
than ex-Senator Stephen M. White of
California. He is a man of great force of
character, of marvelous mentality, really
one of the strongest factors we have In
a nation of strong men. His Integrity has
never been questioned, and his influence
over the people is" as familiar as household
words.

IRISH FOR ThiE TRANSVAAL.
AN Irish correspondent of the London Chronicle
contributes to that paper an elaborate study of
Irish emigration, and suggests that the British
Government should by liberal aid to the emigrants
direct it for some time to come to the Transvaal.
His argument is that by so doing the Government
would gain for the empire a double good â first, it
would retain in the empire thousands of Irish people
who would otherwise come to the United States; and,
second, plant in South Africa a prolific race loyal to
the empire to counteract the Dutch element' which is
now predominant there.
The writer says that the' Irish who come to the
United States become enemies of Great Britain, while
those who emigrate to Canada, Australia or any other
part of the empire grow to be loyal, and he adds:
"Yet at this moment 35,000 Irish leave their country
every year to strengthen the hostile, element in an
alien land, and only 5000 depart to strengthen the
British empire at its extremities. The process has
been going on all these years without the least at
tempt being made by English politicians to arrest the
current or turn it into a new direction. A favorable
opportunity now presents itself for repairing this
omission, and for offering to Ireland an outlet that
will be gratifying to her pride as giving her a special
mission in the life of the empire, and that will grad
ually divert the flow of emigration from America to
a different sphere."
There is need for a good many loyal British sub
jects in South Africa, if the liberty loving Boers are
tc be kept in order without expense to the empire,
for the Dutch population breeds rapidly and at the
present time far outnumbers the people of British
races residing in the country. There is but one rem
edy, says the writer: "That is the free conveyance of
5000 Irish families to the soil of the two republics,
the assignment of lands on the same principles as in
other colonies, and the grant of seeds, implements,
etc., on the security of the lands, subject to the con
dition that the settlers will be released from repay
ment on bringing them under cultivation within a rea
sonable period. In this way a population of between
twenty-five and thirty thousand souls, considerably
less than a year's emigration from Ireland, could be
obtained at once as the basis of a colony identified in
a specially honorable and striking degree with the
name of the sister island."
The proposition sounds well, but there is many a
well sounding plan that turns out different from
expectation. It is quite possible that when the Irish
emigrants and the Boers have made friends and inter
married there might arise a combination among them
to strike once for liberty and thus bring about the
Irish republic of the United States of South Africa.

j British papers at the time over that proof of the fit
! ness of Chinese for military duties. It is not likely
"there will be so much congratulation now. It is
probable that among the foreign-drilled troops that
under Prince Tuan are threatening Tientsin and baf
fling the advance of the relief force there may be some
of the men whom the British trained for military duty
and whom they thought they could count on to fight
for Great Britain in any, emergency.
It is, however, a matter of little moment whether
among the Boxers there be any deserters from the
British-Chinese regiments or not. The significant
feature of the situation is that the Chinese can learn
the arts of war as well as the arts of industry and can
make use of them when roused to fanatic rage against
foreign devils. There are now very few foreign
drilled troops in the Chinese army and not many
armed with better weapons than the bow and the
spear, but the number is increasing and with the in
crease there come dangers for the conquering na
tions. We have seen what came from the awakening
of Japan and may infer what would come from the
awakening, of China, for 'China has ten times the
strength of Japan, and while she has been often over
run,* she has never .failed to engulf and absorb the con
quering race.
BRYAN BREAKS LOOSE.
WHEN Bryan was fishing in the wilds of Wis
consin a report was sent out to the effect that
his managers had arranged a programme of
campaign which did not include Bryan's presence on
the stump. It was said that after his nomination he
would go home and stay there until after election
day, and there would be no repetition of the speech
making tour of 1896.
The report was well received by the public. The
people wished it to be true, and were therefore pre
disposed to believe it. Many reasons were given to
confirm it. In the first place Bryan has canvassed the
country so extensively and so persistently during the
past four years that he has nothing to gain by making
another tour. He is as well known as he will ever be,
and it would be better for him were he less known.
Then it is remembered that in 1896 he lost the States
where he made speeches and carried only those hi
which he did not speak. Finally it is now evident
that Hil!, Gorman and Democrats of that type are
going to make an effort to regain control of the party,
and should they succeed it would be an essential part
of the campaign to keep Bryan as silent as possible
from start to finish.
All of these reasons tended to a belief that the re
port was true, and there was a general feeling of re
lief. Bryan is one of those persons of whom a little
is enough, and the public has had a great deal of him.
Another season of his harangues will be decidedly
too much. Notwithstanding the fact that his retire
ment from the stump would help the Democratic
party, the Republicans were willing it should occur
for the sake of the relief it would give the country.
All of these fair expectations, however, are blighted.
Bryan has returned from his fishing tour and has an
nounced in his first interview that he will make his
own campaign plans, that he will have no managers,
and that if he think it best to take the stump he will
do so.
Now that the report has been upset we can see on
what a flimsy basis it rested. It is true that Bryan's
retirement from the stump would be reasonable and
wise, and yet it should have been recognized that just
because there are good reasons for it Bryan would
take the other course. As soon as the campaign
warms up and the people begin to gather in large
assemblies to listen to orators Bryan will take to
talking as a duck takes to water. He could no more
hold his tongue than he could hold a wild colt by the
tail. Even when he was in the army for a few short
weeks he was in dire distress because he could not
make a speech every time his regiment paraded. He
will be on the stump. It will be Hill and Gorman
who will have to go home and stay there while the
campaign rages.

steadily on most of the claims, but there
Is no excitement Just now except over the
news of the new strikes.
Though the discovery at Topkuk is of
comparatively recent date many have
struck It rich already, and several indi
vidual fortunes, running as high as $25,
000, have been taken out. Parties of two
or three working with ordinary rockers,
It Is said, are taking out $1000 a day. One
little plat of ground, just about big
enough for a good-sized grave, yielded
$15,000 worth of the precious metal. It
lay just at the edge cf the tundra, and
the gold was actually among the grass
and roots. It is reliably estimated that
one stretch of beach 600 feet long by an
average of 90 feet in width has yielded
$475,000 within the past few weeks.
NOME, Alaska. June 8 (via Seattle,
June -26.) â More definite and complete re
turns have lately been received concern-
Ing the beach strike at Topkuk, fifty-live
miles below Nome. There seems no rea
son to doubt that this is one of the great
est strikes ever made in this vicinity and
is as important as the strike at Nome it
self.

STRIKE MADE
AS RICH AS AT
CAPE NOME
e-ipiHE first big disaster in the rush to
! Nome has to be chronicled. The bark
ji Alaska went ashore during a gale
that raged June 5 and 6, and in a.
short time became a total wreck. Several
whalers, revenue cutters and passenger
vessels were in the open roadstead, but
they managed to weather the gale. The
Alaska's anchors dragged, however, and
In a few minutes the old-timer was pound
ing on the beach. Her masts went by the
board on the first impact, and half an
hour later she broke clean in two, and her
600-ton cargo of general merchandise was
strewn along the beach. So heavy was the
surf that not a case of goods was left in
tact, the only thing escaping total destruc
tion being canned salmon, canned meats
and canned fruits.
The Alaska was the second vessel of the
fleet to leave San Francisco for the gold
fields, the brig Pitcairn being the first.
Since the date of her departure nothing
has been heard from her until the news
of the wreck reached the city yesterday.
The strike on the transport wharf has
been settled. The longshoremen. have been
given 40 cents an hour, the same as other
employers are paying.
The British 'ship Crown of India arrived
from Newcastle, England, yesterday. On
March 28 she was caught in a gale and
her foretop-gallant mast carried away.
The steamer Newsboy will not come
back from Nome until the fall. She has
been chartered by the North American
Transportation Company and will connect
with that company's steamers at St. Mi
chael. The Newsboy will run between St.
Michael, Golovin Bay, Cape Nome, Cape
York and Port Clarence.
Captain E. R. Wilson, Chief Engineer
J. Driscoll and John Stange are just back
on the front after three weeks in Lake
County. To hear them tell of bear hunts,
slaughtering wildcats, killing live squir
rels with one shot from a rifle and sup
plying a whole Indian village with trout
caught in Clear Lake is enough to make
the old-time story tellers around Folsom
street wharf turn green with envy.
"Water Front Notes.
H. Lester, J, Back and A. Garrett are
the ostensible owners of the sloop Her
bena, but they never sail in each other's
company any more If possible. There was
a little difference over money matters and
Lester had the best of the argument,
hence the trouble. On Sunday last Lester
decided to take some of his lady friends
out for a sail, and so informed his part
ners. The latter agreed, but later decided
to take the boat out themselves. Lester
smelled a rat and started across the bay
an hour ahead of time, but Back and Gar
rett and three friends were close on his
heels. Just as Lester was about to weigh
anchor the enemy hove in sight and in a
few minutes a free fight was in progress
on the deck of the Herbena. The trouble
was only stopped when four of the com
batants fell overboard. Lester gave up
the yacht and, wet and angry, returned
to the city. The squabble for the pos
session of the yacht will be continued on
July 4, but the chances are that it will
take the courts to settle the dispute.
Yachting Men Quarrel.
The harbor police were kept busy look
ing for a. boiler-maker named Al Lane
yesterday. Sergeant Bunner and Officer
Ferguson visited the British ship Mara
chel.Suchet and the Italian bark Eman
uel Accame. but no traÂ«e of him could be
found. Lane left his home In Berkeley on
Saturday evening and told his family he
would be home on tho last boat. He vis
ited a number of saloons on the water
front and the last seen of him. according
to a story told by Captain Dunleavy at
the Harbor station, he was going out on
the bay in a rowboat. The only vessels
ready for sea are the Suchet and Accame.
so these vessels were visited by the police,
but Lane is still among the missing. Cap
tain Dunleavy does not place the least
credence in the shanghai story, but thinks
the missing boiler-maker will turn up In
the course of a day or two.
Thought He Was Shanghaied.
As soon as Captain Tuttle of the reve
nue cutter Bear saw the danger of the
crew of the whaler he weighed anchor and
went to the rescue. It was a most dan
gerous venture, as the slightest mishap
would have sent the Bear ashore also. But
the crew was taken off and the Bear rode
out the gale without any damage.
The barkentino Catherine Sudden, that
was caught in the ice and dismasted in the?
same gale, has been towed into Dutch
Harbor by the revenue cutter Corwin. She
has been severely crushed, but the chances
are her cargo will be saved.
The steamer Senator had a couple of her
plates dented by the ice and had to return
to Dutch Harbor for repairs. The steam
er Centennial went ashore at Dutah Har
bor during the gale of June 6, but was got
off without damage.
The Cleveland arrived at Nome on June
3, sailing nine days lator. She was com
pelled, with all the other steamers, to put
out to sea till the gale moderated. She
reports seeing saffc at Nome the Corwin
and her tow, the Catherine Sudden,
Robert Dollar, Aloha, San Bias, Dora,
Albion. Thrasher and Mary D. Hume. At
Dutch Harbor â C. D. Lane, Charles Xel
son, schooner Hera, transport Lawton,
revenue cutter McCulloch, gunboat
Wheeling. Dispatch, revenue cutter Perry,
Homer, Edith, Sunol, Ruby A. Cousins
and Martha Tufts. The other vessels not
reported are supposed to be beating their
way through the Ice to Nome. The first
vessel to come to San Francisco direct
from Nome will be the Alaska Commer
cial Company's Portland, which is due
here next Friday or Saturday.
She carried about seventy-five gold-hunt
ers and a crew of twenty-five men all told.
The passengers were all landed with their
effects soon after the vessel anchored, and
then, as soon as the cargo was discharged,
the vessel was to have gone on a whaling
cruise. Captain B. Cogan was the owner
and master of the bark, and with him
were Captain Lew Williams, formerly of
the whaler Hidalgo, and Captain Green,
formerly of the whaler Alexander. Cogan
and Williams v.ere to have remained at
Nome, while Green was to have taken the
Alaska on her whaling cruise. /
THE OLD WHALING BARK ALASKA, WRECKED ON NOME BEACH.
"Portrait Group." the Gerard Oous. Pleter
de Hooghes, Gabriel Metsus, Gainsbor
ough's "Parish Clerk." Reynolds' "Mra.
Siddons," would have to be considered if
Â¦we were not obliged to choose between
them and more important works.
It is of interest to trace the develop
ment of the feeling for landscape in thes8
schools, but that has often been done. Tho
great thlnars In landscape painting â light,
air and distance â were discovered by tho
figure painters; the landscaplsts. even
Constable and the Barbizon men. have
cnlv applied these discoveries.
â¢"l"he Boar Hunt" is one of the most
modern of landscapes. It Is more modern
by far than those of Claude, Poussin and
the Dutchmen; more modern even than
Gainsborough's "Market Cart"; its true
place is with contemporary paintings like
Whistler's and Manet's.
One great name remainsâ that of Tur
ner. It Is easier to get people to pretend
an admirationâ which they Â« > not feelâ
for Turner's â¢worst work than to make
them appreciate his best. An Idealist with
an extraordinary knowledge of nature and
an extraordinary contempt for sound
methods in art. his work is often marred
by willfulness and cockney bad taste. But
in pure ideal landscape no one has yet
produced anything to hear comparison
with the "Old Temeraire" or with the
"Burial at Sea" of the painter 'Wilkie â by
mingled torchlight and moonlight, with a
phantom rock of Gibraltar In the distance.
It is to be said, too, that Turner's capri
cious playing with light and color has
been a stimulus to Claude Monet In his
more scientific and more hopeful re-
Bearches.
With Turner and Velasquez we are at
the threshold of the modern Impression
istic school. In the too brief review which
we have made we have found ourselves
obliged to pass over accomplished imita
tors to give our attention to men perhaps
at many points their inferiors, but who
were Innovators and progressive. Thl3
should teach, us not to bo hostile to the
PHILIP IV OF SPAIN*. BY VE
LASQUEZ.
On the National Gallery.)
It were to small purpose In a short
paper such as this to speak of thÂ«Â» llttla
masters of Holland. France and England.
Clouet's "Portrait of a Boy," LeNaln's
definite forms. He might, as has been
said of Whistler, paint "a dark night
with nothing in It. but he preferred to
paint definite objects In their definite re
lations of tone. Hence a fuller represent
ation of reality, which yet is not realistic,
but the result of a more informed ideal
ism.
It is still accounted heresy by some to
say that painting continued to develop
after the decline of the. great Italian
schools; but the proof Is hero In the
"Chapeau de Paille" of Rubens, in the
self portrait and "Portrait of an Old
Ladv in a White Ruff," by Rembrandt,
in the Vandykes, in the "Holy Family'
and the "Infant St. John" of Murillo and
in the two portraits of Philip IV and the
"Boar Hunt," by Velasquez. Especially
in the latter there is a new sense of the
relation of the background to the fig
ures. In Michael Angelo's "Entomb
ment" space Is completely filled by the
figures. The picture is an abstraction
which oppresses almost as much as It im
presses us. In the "Bacchus and Ariadne"
the landscape exists, but it bears no true
relation to the flsrures: the values are
nowhere exact. Even in Rembrandt the
mysterious depth of the background de
pends largely on the objects half seen
through It gloom. But for Velasquez
space, air andilght exist, with or without

ed. The "Knight In Armor," attributed to
Giorgione, may not be his, nor the other
pictures assigned to him, "The Garden of
Love," with its youthful couples strolling
or resting in the grass on either side of
a small rivulet, and the "Venus and Adon
is," but these have certainly something of
his spirit, "a high-strung sort of poetry,"
as Pater says, permeating the ordinary or
hackneyed subject. By, his master, Gio
vanni Bellini, we have the portrait of
Doge Loredano: by his fellow-pupil.
Titian, the "Bacchus and Ariadne."
The exuberance of life in this great
painting is very poorly represented in the
well-known engravings of it, which, nev
ertheless, give more than can be put Into
words. Enjoyment of life, but of a quieter
sort, is the main thing embraced in Lotto's
celebrated picture of himself and family.
The motion, pressure and glory of life at
tract us in Tintoretto's "Milky Way" and
Veronese's "Family of Darius Before
Alexander," with its display of splendid
costumes and magnificent architecture.
The National Gallery has no example
! of Leonardo's mastery over line, modeling
1 and expression. The original painting of
the "Virgin of the Rocks" Is undoubtedly
that In the Louvre. But in Luini's "Christ
With Disciples and Doctors of the
Church," formerly attributed to Leonardo,
we have a very good example of the Lom
bard school founded by him. Botticelli's
"Mars and Venus" may give a notion of
the value of line and contour in the Flor
entine school, and his mystical "Nativ
ity," in which angels dance a merry-go
round in the sky above the stable and an
gels and youths are embracing in the fore
ground, is a distinct echo of the middle
ages. The unfinished "Entombment," by
Michael Angelo, a group supreme in com
position, movement and mass. In a gener
alized landscape, vague but impressive, is
one of the few great pictures in the collec
tion. "The Embassadors," by Holbein,
portraits of two unknown noblemen, with
a table covered with charts and documents
between them, may be mentioned here as
a more than adequate example of the con
temporary German school.
There is nothing to show Raphael's
great merits as a composer, though his
"Madonna and Child with St. John and St.
Nicholas of Bari" is one of his best pre
served altar pieces. But if there Is little
cf the Florentine and central Italian
schools at their best, the more attractive
Venetian school, with its glow cf color and
varied textures, is eenerouslv reDresent-
We may now turn to the acknowledged
great masters, and we shall find that with
them too the special purpose determines
the character of the work. They had none
of the pride of our day in being able to do
what, for all we know or care, may not be
worth doing. Art was to them, as to their
precursors, a way to communicate some
thing felt or perceived by them and which
they considered to' be worth the trouble.
As skill in representation advanced a more
rational symbolism replaced the arbitrary
one derived from, the Byzantines, and with
a fuller understanding of nature and of
life "profane" matters were more often
treated. The old subjects were taken up
again and handled with greater power,
and owing to the possession of thit same
power of vivid representation subjects be
fore indifferent or trivial were found
worthy of artistic interpretation.

Chicago opened nervous and Irregular, with
everybody selling. The market declined from
86c to 82%c, partially recovered to 83%c and fell
back to 82%c. The break on Monday waa due
to heavy selling, which had not been expected
under 90c. As the session advanced there was
an undercurrent of strength, and though there
has been great unloading there was a disposi

The situation in the three damaged States
was reported worse. If ppsslble. There were
light showers of less than 1-10 of an Inch at a
few points in the Northwest. Minneapolis re
ported the weather clear and hot. W Ires from
Fargo reported a total failure and another
stated that from Grand Forks to Devils Lake
not an acre will be cut and that North Dakota
will not harvest her seed. Senator Washburn
of Minnesota, after a personal inspection, says
that the three States will not harvest over 50,
000 fcOO buohels. which is another serious reduc
tion in the estimates. The yield last year was
200.000,000 bushels and 75,000,000 was the estimate
two or three days aco.
The local market was lower on call, with a
decline in outside support. The spot market
was nominal and unchanged.

LOCAL MARKETS.
THE STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 26.â The wheat market
might be likened to a "sober second thought."
It was active but not wild and traders in a
more leisurely manner readjusted to a degree
prices which broke loess and went soaring last
week. There was no change in the North
western situation. The Dakotas and ' Minne-
Eota renewed their pitiful cries of distress over
the ruin of their crops, but generally the cries
fell upon deaf ears.- On the other hand the
Liverpool close was 3^c under yesterday and
it was declared that the Southwest would
raise 100.000,000 bushels more than last year,
an amount nearly sufficient to make up for
the shortage occasioned by the Northwest fail
ure. Local longs pressed heavily on the mar
ket at the opening, which was at 85Uc to 83%c
for July. The break stirred the Northwest
and selling orders from that section poured in
early, sending July down to 82Hc within an
hour of the opening. Some of the important
longs were not sellers, but they were a email
minority, for the crowd with big profits in
view was large. Later in the . day July re
covered to 83%c on a little less pressure from
longs for the moment. The bulge was lost in
ehort order and probably the decline was only
ended by the clcslng of the session. The close
was at the bottom, July 4c under yesterday,
at Co?n broke early with wheat, but recovered
later and the end of the session found the
market firm. July closed hie under yesterday
at Oats i Â°were comparatively quiet. The market
broke early with wheat, but steadied later in
sympathy with corn.' The close was at a loss
of %Â«"V2e for July at 25Vi@2S%c. .
Provisions were steady in the face of lower
hogs and the wheat break. July pork closed

Effects of the Prune Combine.
The New York Commercial, under date of
June 23, says:
â¢'Telegrams were received yesterday morning
from San Jose. Cal.. telling of the final suc-
C rfs of the efforts to organize the California
Cured Fruit Association. It is not known ex
actly what the terms of organization are. one
inn m re paying on the ba=is of SÂ»0 per cent of.
aerer-ge in f?a;:ta Clara Valley and SO per cent
of the acreage of all California, and another
telegram Ftating simply that plans had fuc
ceÂ«3ed rn an S3 per cer.t basis. The news that
thf- combine had at last been brought to pass
Ftrer.dhened the prune market immediately
tnd ;i is extremely doubtful if present prices
could be shaded any. Indeed, it is likely the
market will go slightly higher ivhrn full par
ticulars of the prune combine organization
come to hand."
The tame paper on the following day added:
"The Ftrer.Fther.ing effect on the prune mar
ket of the formation of the prune combine in
California was further in evidence during the
Any and the report that the combines plans
had succeeds apparently struck European
markets rather forcibly, for cables were re
ceived from different points, all asking for ol
fers of crune?."

vents any accumulation of stock. Plums are
quiet, but not particularly weak. Figs are in
lighter supply, but quiet.

still scarce and in good demand.

of the session waÂ» considerably unsettled and
spotty in spite of the sustaining influence of

BARBER'S CHAIR
AS JUDGE'S BENCH
MILES, June 26.â Justice of
the Peace Richmond of
Alvarado dispensed justice
to-day from a barber's
chair in a local tonsoiialist's shop.
This unusual procedure w'as nec
essary because the town of Nlles
cannot boast of a court, and the
tonsorial establishment was the
most convenient place in which to
listen to the pleadings of the liti
gants. The; latter happened to.be
two Portuguese, who had fought
over the alleged trespasses of i a
large goat.
Several days ago Joe Ramos and
Mary Furtado, who are neighbors
"and who up to a short time ago
were friends, met at the fence
which divides . their respective
lands. In the row that followed
over the goat In question some
harsh language was used, and Ra
mos was arrested on a charge of
disturbing the peace.
The nearest Justice was Judge
Richmond of Alvarado, and he
was sent for. Looking around on
his arrival this morning he could
find no suitable hall, and finally
struck upon the local barber shop
as a' convenient temple of justice.
Taking up his judicial position on
the center revolving chair of the
shop. Justice Richmond opened
court. Witnesses were called and
examined and everything went
smoothly, except when the ad
justable chair attempted a few
gyrations on its own account.
The only persons 'who were
heard to complain were the sev
eral men who came In to be
shaved and nearly lost their ears
when the proprietor of the shop
became engrossed in the weighty
legal opinions from the judicial
occupant of his center chair.
The testimony in the . case was
bo contradictory that - Justice
Richmond could see nothing to do
but allow Ramos his liberty.

pointing toward Its extraordinary desire

cerning its motives can be set at rest.
Without jeopardizing and practically an
nihilating their case, the sellers of water
are bound to keep hands off consumers
until a decision can be reached.
rsefore the Supreme Court yesterday At
torney McCutcheon for the water com
pany made no secret of his effort to push
the suit. In his argument upon the ques
tion of Judge Hart's eligibility the attor
ney dcclartd that he was most anxious to
get to trial before July 1. He wanted the
case out of the way so that his clients
could collect revenue, which they certain
ly cannot touch during the litigation :is it
now stands. With the new rates in effect
the company will be unable to collect upon
any other basis unless the decision shall
invalidate these figures. There Is nothing
more desired by Special Counsel Hayne
than that the company shall make one
single collection under the new rates. He
would invite such a move.
A further difficulty which confronts the
water company at this stage of the litiga
tion is its apparent fear of summary ac
tion on the part of the city should an at
tempt h<- madv to eotiest revenue upon any
rates at all. ThÂ«?rt is a distinot provision
in the central law of the State which pro
vides for the forfeiture of the franoliis'?
and the confiscation of the works of any
corporation which shall collect rates in
f xcf-5? of those fixed by law. It is inferred
from the complaint of the company that
som<? action in contemplation of this law
is feared, because the corporation has
charged that threats have been made that
an attempt will be made tn forfeit the
franchise. This â¢ could only be done
through xho Attorney General of the State.
Attorney McCutcheon has declared that
he would try to enjoin the city from so
moving. On the other hand, the city's
counsel deny that any such move Is con
templated.
Tho situation Is such that it will be un
necessary for the city to act. The rates
â¢which po into effect on July 1 are legal
until otherwise declared by the courts,
t'pon thf-se rates the water company can
collect, but it has seen fit to attack them,
and thos is unable to collect without
smashing its charges into fragments.
The city has as=kÂ»Â»<i for a reasonable time
in which to properly prepare to meet this
aitack. The corporation responds with its
remarkable rush.
OAKLAND. June 26.â The extraor
dinary zeal manifested by the
Contra Costa Water Company in its
efforts to force its attack upon the
water rates to trial has been In marked
contrast to the usual methods or corpora
linns In litigation. In nine cases out ol
ten in the courts where a great corpora
sion is a rarty the records indicate that
t-lothfulness is a marked characteristic of
its legal movements. The surprising
speed Jn this particular case has then?
fore been the subject of marked comment
by the cltlzerr% of Oakland, who are
watching, in common with the State at
largo, the fight which is on.
The reason for the water combine's ex
traordinary efforts to force a trial is
purely a financial one. The company has
by its own 'acts placed itself in a position
to be unable to collect one dollar of reve
nue from the water consumers of thi.,
city until this litigation shall be con
cluded. Should Jt attempt to enforce pay
ments upon the rates which go into effect
on July 1 the company would make the
admission that its own complaint in the
attack was false, for therein is contained
the charge that these rates were unlaw
fully tfxed.
This situation is a serious one for the
company and involves eerious conse-
Quenei's for it ties up a great revenue anJ
leaves the corporation without a chance
to collect a penny from either municipal
or private consumers. .
The attorneys for the water company
opened their fight just as soon a-<= Judge
Hart of Sacramento stepped upon the
Â¦bench to compel an immediate trial. They
huftled and battled. In the face of the
plain rules of the Alameda County Su
perior Court and In the absence of the
City Attorney, who is associated in the
trial with Robert Y. Hayne, special coun
sel for the city, the water company's at
torneys demanded that the trial be at
once set. They were met by the strong
legal objections of Mr. Hayne and further
they were confronted by a counter de
mand for the company's books, a demand
which Judge Hart has once denied and
novr holds under a second motion' for de
cision.

SALINAS, June 26.â Little Willie Clerk.
a boy about 6 years of age and the son ot
Mrs. E. M. Clark, was drowned in tho
Salinas River yesterday.
Early In the afternoon Willie, In com
pany with his brother, aged 7, and his
cousin, aged S years, the son of Mr. LaU.
left the house to go to the river to flsh
after having been admonished by their
grandmother to avoid the many deep
holes which abound in the river at that
point. The children contented themselves
with fishing and wading until about 4:30
o'clock. When they started to return
home and Willie, becoming thirsty, knelt
down to get a drink. It was a fatal move,
for the little fellow lost his balance and
slid into the water, which was sixteen
feet deep. One of the boys attempted to
to save the lad and as a result nearly lost
his own life. Another ran for assistance
to their home. The scene of the sad ac
cident was three-quarters of a mile from
the ranch.
An uncle went to the place to recover
the body. The water was so deep,
however, that he could not reach the body
by diving and a boat had to be procured
and the body recovered with grappling
hooks. Coroner Muller was notified of
the death of the child, but did not deem
that an Inquest Â¦was necessary as no fur
ther facts than the above could be estab
lished.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, June 26.
When the application of Horace W.
Philbrook to te appointed guardian of
James P. Merrltt, who, he says, is In
competent, was called for hearing before
Judge Ogden this morning, Attorney Nus
baumer, representing Merrltt, moved that
the case, be continued until Judge Ells
worth returns from his vacation and can
take it up.
"We believe that Judge Ellsworth is
more familiar with the matter," said Nus
baumer, "and as the application for
guardianship of the Merrltt children
comes up on July 10, both cases could be
tieard at the same time."
It was at this point that Attorney Nus
baumer took occasion to attack Horace
VV. Philbrcok, the applicant for guardian
ship papers, and his remarks so aroused
the ire of his opponent that Judge Ogden
was compelled to Interpose.
"This action of Horace W. Phllbiook,"
said Nusbaumer, continuing with his mo
tion for a continuance, "against his for
mer client, arises out of spite and malice."
Here Philbrook made an objection, but
Nusbaumer continued to talk.
"I think," he said, "that as Judge Ells
worth heard the divorce case of the de
fendant and his wife, he is the proper
Judge to sit In this case."
"1 object to the remarks just made by
Mr. Nusbaumer," j interrupted Philbrook.
"If counsel wishes Â«to speak on what Is
of record let him keep to the records. If
he Is going outside of them, let him make
proper affidavits of what he says and
offer the proper proof. I object to such
scandalous statements. They are entirely
unprofessional."
At this Juncture the argument became
so heated that a personal encounter was
looked for. In reply to Philbrook's ac
cusation of unprofessionalism, Nusbaumer
retorted with considerable warmth:
"It is not necessary for me to resent
any remarks coming from this 'thing.' "
As Philbrook was about to reply to the
sarcastic remarks of his adversary. Judge
Ogden called for order saying:
"Gentlemen, I will not allow any such
remarks to be made in this court. It is
a violation of legal ethics which I will not
permit and does not show proper respect
to the court."
"I will not stand such remarks from
any one," said Attorney Nusbaumer,
"no matter who he may be. I beg to
apologize to your Honor for any breach of
ethics."
Continuing with his original motion, At
torney Nusbaumer said:
"I deny that James P. Merrltt is In
competent or that Philbrook has any right
to petition to be appointed his guardian.
I will show that the applicant is insol
vent and that his true motive in appear
ing in his present position is b. vicious
one. I will show that he Is not a fit or
proper person to have the guardianship
or even make the application."
Â¦ "I suppose that is Mr. Nusbaumer's
oral answer to my application," said Phil
brook. "It might more properly be called
a tirade. What counsel has said about
me in this matter is entirely without
foundation. I am willing to have this ap
plication heard before any Judge of the
Superior Court, but I wish first to Intro
duce some testimony. If this matter is
continued until July 10, as suggested, it
Is impossible for me to say what damage
would result. My petition alleges that
Merrltt is being stripped of his property
and I would like to take the testimony of
a few witnesses before this mattfcr goes
over."
At this point Attorney A. L. Frick. as
sociated with Emil Nusbaumer, objected
to the Introduction of testimony as such
a course would' enable Philbrook to file
amended papers to conform with the evi
dence adduced.
"What Mr. Frick- says is not true,"
sharply answered Philbrook. fin this
matter I am proceeding against danger
ous and cunning men and it Is necessary
that certain testimony be taken."
Judge Ogden stopped further quibbling
by postponing the hearing until July 10
lie denied Horace Philbrook's motion to
assess the costs of the action against
James P. Merritt on the ground that it
bad not been shown that he was incom
petent.

RICHMOND, Va., June 26.â Professor A.
M. Hughlett, formerly of Randolph Macon
Academy, at Bedford City, who myste
riously disappeared about a year ago. Is
on his way home from San Francisco. Mr.
Hughlett left home mysteriously on June
19, 1S9S, and for a time no one knew
whither he had gone.
The board of the academy and all those
connecltd with it had the highest confi
dence in Professor Hughlett. Year after
year the institution was managed with In
finite cere. Nobody yet knowsâ possibly
Hughlett does not know himself â how he
got behind in his accounts or whether it
was a ca.se of bad management, bad In
vestment, false friends, poor bookkeeping
rr what. He had never lived extravagant
ly, and, so far as anybody knew or knows,
had no bad habits. It seems established
now beyond question that he had no pui
pose to defraud or wrong anybody.
At the close of the session of 1897-93 he
was 510,000 short and was unable to make
the amount good. Then he disappeaiol,
nnd all kinds of theories were suggested.
Some persons contended that he was de
mented and others that he had commit 1 ed
suicide. His father-in-law promptly paid
the amount of the seeming shortage.
Intelligence has just been received here
that 3Ir. Hughlett was In San Francisco
and Is on his way here. He has raadj
enough while in the city of the Golden
Gate to pay up all of his Indebtedness.

OAKLAND. June 26.â In recognition
of his fidelity and bravery In sav
ing from disaster a tralntoad of
passengers In a wreck on the Ala
meda narrow gauge road Engineer Asa
T. French has received distinguished and
extraordinary honors from the Scottish
Rite Consistory of Free Masonry. For the
first time in the history of the Scottish j
Rite on the Pacific Coast the peculiar dis- j
tlnction of the full consistory degree ha3
been conferred upon Engineer French as !
an honorarium. The Masonic Veterans' j
Association of the Pacific Coast has also j
given recognition to the act of devotion J
to duty by making the faithful engineer ;
a member of that organization.
In celebration pt this extraordinary!
event the Scottish Rite of Oakland held a
united meeting last right, at which lur- j
ther were conferred upon En- |
gineer French. In behalf of the consis- !
tory he was presented with a thirty- j
second degree jewel, magnificently stud- '[
ded with diamonds. The presentation i
was made by Master C. L. J. WJ Pierco j
and the thirty-second lecture was deliv
ered by F. H. E. O'Donnell.
The recipient made a response and was
much overcome, the affair having been a.
complete surprise to him.
In the official record of the conferring
of the high degree upon Engineer French
the following tribute to him Is entered:
For manly courage and devotion to duty In
remaining at his post as a locomotive engineer
in the midst of danger and fatal catastrophe j
In the overturning of the engine through |
faulty construction of the rallroail to the Ala- i
meda Mole, and by fidelity to h!s post nt the <
risk of his own life in which he puftere-rbodily j
injury, he managed to prevent fatal <i I ouster j
to the passenjssra aboard his train. Though

wrecked locomotive, by Brother French's care

enters Â¦were preserved and they escaped all
harm.
The act which called forth the enco
miums was in connection with the wreck
of the Alameda train on May 14. The en
gine Jumped the track near a curve on the
narrow gauge lino Into Alami-di at the
roundhouse. French stayed at his post
and was badly hurt by the failure of his
reverse lever to catch through the pound
ing and jerking of the engine over the
ties. He succeeded In stopping the train,
but went down with the engine when It
overturned. The five carloads of passen
pers were saved. His fireman. George El
liott, had hi3 skull fractured, but recov
ered.
French has been a locomotive engineer
since 1S37. He Is M years of ajre and has
been In the Southern Pacific employ for
twenty-five years. Before coming to Cali
fornia he was employed on many Eastern
and Western railroads. He Is a veteran of
the civil war, having served for four years
In the Eleventh Ohio Volunteers.
One of French's most conspicuous acts
of bravery was his work In saving a plcnio
train carrying 500 people at Bodle several
years asro from being rolled dnwn a steep
and high embnnkment through the care
lessness of another engineer. French had
an engine on the roar end of the train.
The engineer on the forward locomotive
was drunk. At a dangerous curve the
train was all but pitched off the track,
when French by skill and cool Â¦work held
it with his engine. He received a tre
mendous receptldn from tha citizens of
Bodie for his courage.
French -was made a Master Mason of
Oakland Ledge No. 188 In 1S90. In 1S96 he
received the fourteenth degree in Oak
land Lodge No. 2. Scottish Rite. The
lodges which tcok part In his elevation
Â¦were as follows: Gthsemane Chanter No.
2. Rose Croix; De Molay Council No. 2,
Kadosh; Oakland Consistory No. 2. Scot
tish Rite.
Knglneer French resides at 1107 Mound
street. Alameda. He is married and has
thirteen children.

DROPSY FROM COFFEE.
People Beginning to Lrearn About the
Drug.
'â¢Coffee treated me so badly that I
Â¦want to tell people about it, and if you
can use my letter I will be glad. I am
not a very good scholar, but want to
write a few lines, and if I don't write a
good letter I am at least honest in my
statements.
*"I am 45 j-ears old and drank coffee
all my life up until New Year's. I have
felt bad for years and did not know
what ailed me. I thought I had the
dropsy and heart disease. Sometimes
I v.ould have to press my hand against
my heart, I would be in such pain, and
I got so I could hardly do my work.
My head would feel heavy and dizzy; .
and rri2ny a time I have got so blind I
â¢would just have to drop down or else
I would have fallen.
"I felt bad all over. My feet would
fweil and hurt me and I am confident if
I had continued drinkine coffee I
wouldn't have been able by this time to
do anything. A friend of mine asked
jne to try Postum Food Coffee and stop
flrir.kinq; regular coffee. I tried the
Postum, but it was some days before I
pot hold of the right way to make it.
My heart disease and dropsy disappear-
ed and I pot entirely well.
"There is much in making it. That is,
it has to he. boiled longer than ordinary
coffee, but when I got it made good it
was fine, and now I wouldn't have cof-
fee in my house at all. I am sure the
Postum Food Coffee saved my life, and :
I am perfectly well. Oh. how much I
would like to see Postum in every
home. I can't praise it enough. I send
you here the names of about twenty
people that have been helped by leaving
off coffee and using Postum Food Cof-
fee. (Then follows a list of names and
addresses.) Hoping this vrill be of bene-
fit to some one. I remain, yours truly."

Case of Mistaken Identity Leads to
Coolness Between Two Peace
Guardians.
There is a coolness existing at present
between Police Officers T. W. Handly and
J. H. Crowley. which will not be appeased
by any amount of explanations. Handly
13 recognized as being the handsomest
man with stripes on his trousers on the
entire police force. This beauty won for
him a gate prizeâ a case of wineâ at the
last picnic given by the Society of Eagles.
Handly's modesty overcame him when
the time arrived for the presentation of
tho winning ticket to Bendy Hay, a gro
cer on "Valencia street, who put up the
prize for the picnic. To get the wine and
still retain his modesty was a task of no
small consequence, but after thinking the
thing over for a few nights Handly ar
rived at a solution. This was to give the
card calling for the liquid to tils friend
Detective Jack Fitzgerald of the Mission
division. Fitzgerald handed the card to a
brother officer wjth instructions to have
the beverage sent to Handly's residence
at 4417 Twentieth street. Bendy Hay rec
ognized the order and at once dispatched
the case of wine to the residence, but
alas! "Handsome" was out on duty and
tho wine was left at the corner bakery
In the meantime Officer Crowley, who
lives at 4409 Twentieth street, arrived at
the bakery for his daily bread, and the
man who mixes the dough told him there
was a case of wine for him. This un
expected news filled him with Joy. He
picked up the case and carried it to his
home, and at once reported to his supe
riors that ho wished to be excused for a
week on very important special business.
In the meantime Handly wondered why
his wine did not come, and lost no time
in digging up Jack Fitzgerald for an ex
planation. Jack Is at all times ready to
explain, so he told the handsome man
of what he had done. It did not take
"Handsome" long to discover where the
nigger was in the woodpile. Since then
Handly^'has positively refused to be
Crowley's rear rank man on dress pa
rade. The atmosphere assumes a Klon
dike chill Just now as the two "cops"
pass each other by. Fitzgerald Â¦ blushes
at his blunder in beating "Handsome"
out of the wine and sending It to a man
who took a week off duty to consumo it.

UNCLE COLLIS BUYS
LANDS AT MARTINEZ
Purchase of Tracts Near the Water
Front Gives Hise to Variety
of Rumors.
The Southern Pacific Company has pur
chased a tract of land near the water
front of Martinez, consisting of about six
and a half acres. This includes tho
property of the old starch works, the pas
works, the Rlum warehouse property and
the tract owned by Louie Strentzel Muir
The purchase price was $12,000. This gives
the road a clear right of way through the
town.
There is much speculation concerning
the purpose of this move. At Martinez*
there is a rumor that shops will be built
by the Southern Pacific Company at that
place. A forc.-> of railway surveyors re
cently visited Martinez and set the people
to wondering. They went over the tract
that has non- been purchased. One storv
Is that ihe Alhambra Cre^k will b> bridged
and that the move is to shorten the route
to San Francisco, to compete on more
oven terms with the Santa Fe. which has
a remarkably direct line to this city from
Stockton.

5^/^ RS. JEXXT E. BELSHAW,
//\(\ wldow of the late M - W - Bel "
II Mi \ fihaw an<^ m other of Assembly
man C. M. Belshaw, passed
away yesterday at her home, 1626 Jack
son street.
Mrs. Belshaw was possessed of an am
iable disposition and had the faculty of
making many friends. The announcement
of her death will be received with aeep
regret by all who knew her.
Mrs. Helshaw has been in bad health
since the death of her husband two years
ago. but no serious results were antici
pated until tiie last two weeks. Assem
blyman Bolshaw was notified of the sud
den change and with his wife came from
his home at Antioch to be at his mother's
bedside. MKsJM
Mrs. Belshaw arrived in California in
1F5S and settled in Amador County, where
her husband became prominently identi
fied with large mining Interests. Th*
couple moved to San Francisco In 1870
and selected as a residence the house in
which Mrs. Belshaw died. The funeral
will take place to-morrow.
A rather interesting bit of instruction
came from the quartermaster general of
the army to the local quartermaster last
week, and Â¦when it was conveyed to the
bidders on the shoe contracts, for whom
It was Intended, it caused llrst surprise
end then protest. They intend to have
the regulation, for it amounts to that, re
bcinded, or they will make a fight over It.
In a circular of instruction to Colonel
Long, the purchasing quartermaster on
this coast. General Luddington. the quar
tenriasttr general, declares that Califor
nia sole leather is not good enough to be
"jsed in the manufacture of army shoes,
and he declares that contracts must be
bid uj>on witn the understanding that Cal
ifornia sole leather shall not be used in
the manuiaciure of the shoes fun::sned.
The regulation is made in the face of
the fact that California sole leather has
a rt'ijutiition widtr and more enaunug
than mat of tnÂ« quartermaster general
:..:...-â¢.:. It js orie oi the fcta]>le products
of this Btate. and it nas been pronounced
by experts who nave devoted more unic
to the istudy ot tne article thai} tne con
tract cf which it lorms a part to t>e wan
out equal ar.ywntrc, aim iaey uaiiK ineir
opinion with iheir coin. In tne t^ast Cali
fornia sole leatncr vrm et-H lor lu per cent
more than sole learner from elsewhere
inertly txcause it has been made out here.
'j he tanbark here is better, the climate is
V-etter and the hides are better. Mne Kast
is Us biggest market, and every day thou
tanos vi nides are snipped to various jac
toncs beyond Hie KocKies. Tne men in
the Bhoe business and in any business in
which leather forms a part nave no hesi
tation in accepting Calilornia leather, and
they have no fault to lind with it. And
the best proof of their satisfaction is that
tliey are willing to pay more for it. lint
the quartermaster general thinks other
wise and has said that it shall not form
part of the chocs furnished the army.
There tnu*t Iw *ome reason lor tne ac
tion of tne quartermaster's department,
and what the merchants are aevoting
their energies to now is to find what
caused the Budden change of heart on tho
part of the <juart<.rmaster general. It was
iv>t long ago Hlr.ce it was officially de
clared that California leather was the
finest in the world for harness, and the
army would have harness made of noth
ing t-lse. iiut it 4ias suddenly been found
that it is not geoo. enough for the soies or
50ldiers' shoes.
- In about a month bids for furnishing
the army footwear will be opened. The
shoe manufacturers will figure promi
nently in the contest for contracts princi
pally because of the hard fight that was
r*-oently made in Congress in favor of
Pacific Coast manufacturers and in order
to get euch concessions from the Gov
ernment as would allow them to bid on
terms equal to those controlling the East
ern firms. It was only after a hard fight
that suitable terms were secured, but theÂ»
good of it all seems to have been taken
out of the situation by the action of the
quartermaster general. It they cannot
use their own leather the California shoe
men cannot bid. so the result Is arrived
?.t by the Eastern dealers just the same
as ir no fight for the California traders
had ever beei made, and in addition they
have the satisfaction of knowing tha't
California has been passed a large and
gaudy pold brick.
By some of the manufacturers the regu
lation is credited to the. influence of the
leather men of the East* who have taken
that method .and this opportunity to rele
gate California's first class sole leather
to a s=eat In the second row, while their
own goes Into the army contracts without
opposition.
The shoe men have taken the matter
up and they will communicate with tho

ONE of the prettiest weddings of the
season took place in Trinity Pres
byterian Church, on the corner of
Twenty-third and Capp streets, last
evening. James Rolph Jr. of the firm of
Hind, Rolph & Co., and Miss Annie Mar
shall Reid were the contracting parties.
Mr. Rolph is one of the most popular of
the younger business men in the commu
nity, and Miss Reid's friends are legion.
In consequence the church was crowded
to the doors and the universal comment
was that a handsomer couple had never
been wedded In Trinity. The church was
tastefully decorated for the occasion.
The bride is a direct descendant of the
old Covenanters, while the groom Is an
Episcopalian. In consequence the Rev.
Dr. Mackenzie of the First Presbyterian
Church and the Rev. L.. C. Sanford of St.
John's Episcopal Church both officiated
at the ceremony. The bride was attended
by Miss Jeanie Reid as maid of honor and
by Miss Mildred T. Rolph. Miss Gertrude
Slbbald and Miss Marion 'Cummlng as
bridesmaids. George U. Hind, Mr. Rolph's
business partner, was his best man, and
the ushers were Ronald T. Rolph, Thomas
Rolph, Archibad Reid, Robert Reid, James
H. Lyons. Henry H. Beatty, Archibald N.
Nason, Charles W. Haseltine and "William
E. Nicol.
Saturday night last Mr. Rolph bade all
his bachelor friends good-by at a dinner
in the Palace, and all of them were pres
ent last night to see him join the ranks of
the benedicts. If good wishes will do the
young couple any good they certainly re
ceived a measure brimming over.
Mr. and Mrs. Rolph will leave for the
Hawaiian Islands on the steamer Austra
lia to-day. They will bo gone two months
and all the points of Interest in the group
will be visited. During his stay In Hono
lulu Mr. Rolph will establish a branch of
the house of Hind, Rolph & Co.

' Â£=3 VERY seat for the monster
r^ Sweeney benefit which is to be
' j held on Friday afternoon at the
Grand Opera-house is gone, and
there are still S0O0 holders of exchange
tickets who will have to take their
chances at gallery Feats or standing-
"When the benefit entertainment was
first arranged the tiK'atrical managers is-
Fue<i 4000 tickets, 2(XW at which they gave
to the Fire Department to dispose of, re
serving the balance to be sold by them
selves. Such, however, has been the en
thusiastic zeal of the Fire Department in
the matter that they disposed of 10.000
tickets, just 1000 more than the managers
expected them to sell.
Last evening there was a meeting of
the various manager?, the object belr.g
to find a way out of the difficulty. At
first it was thought a double entertain
ment, one at the California and one at
the Gran>i. mijrht prove practical. Hut
after considerable discussion the man
agers arrived at the conclusion that a
double affair would not prove satisfac
tory. Artists would be latlyrued with
double calls upon their cervices, and one
of the entertaar.ments would necessarily
have to suffer at the expense of the other.
The most potent argument advanced,
however, was that even with a double en
tertainment all ticket lio!ders would not
be able to secure seats, and bo the propo
sition was abandoned.
It took just one hour and ten minutes
yesterday morning to dispose of every
eeat in the Grand Opera-house. At ex
ortly 9 o'rlock Treasurer Henry Camp
bell stepped into the glass-facd office
and sold the first benefit- seat, and at ten
minutes after 10 he pulled down his win
dow and announced the sale closed.
In ppite of the fact that there were sev
eral hundred ticket holders still in line
th^re were no murmurs of dissatisfac
tion. Thf people had pi von their money
to a worthy rau=e. and in the thought of
a noble dted well done they lost sight of
the personal amusement to be derived
from their contribution to the splendid
whole.

The initial outing of the San Francisco
Hay Association was held yesterday, as
suming the form of an excursion on the
bay. The officers of the association char
tered the steamer Zinfandel, on which
they entertained with lavish hospitaiity
some 400 guests. After steaming about
the bay the party were taken to the Mare
Island Navy Yard, where they disem
barked. All the wonders of the yard were
unfolded to the visitors by persons famil
iar with the many things of interest to
be seen.
The next stop was at McNears Landing,
a favorite resort of the yachtsmen. Here
the chief festivities of the day were en
joyed. Ritzau's band provided music for
the devotees of the waltz and the three
step, while those athletically Inclined
Joined in the more robust sports of the
field for prizes provided by the associa
tion. Luncheon was partaken of here,
and with appetites sharpened by the keen
air on the bay all did justice to the viands
placed before them. The return journey
was accomplished without Incident, the
party reaching home at 6 p. m.
The arrangements for the outing were
in the capable hands of Edward Aigelttn
ger and Herman Stint, who left nothing
undone which would tend to the pleasure
or the comfort of the association's guests.
President W. W. Miller and Directors
F. A. Summer, J. Magner and H. E. Ellis
were so pleased with the success of the
affair that they determined at once to

TO PLAY HOSTS
At the headquarters of the Republican
County Committee in the Baldwin Annex
gratifying reports ate received of the en
rollment of voters In the various Assem
bly districts. The rolls will remain open
until next Saturday evening. Active can
vassing is in progress in several of the
districts. Many well-known citizens,
who have not taken a prominent part in
politics for several years, have enlisted
for this campaign. In the Forty-first
Assembly District 200 voters have signed
the club roll. In the Thirty-flrst the en
rollment approximates 200. The Forty
third will organize a large club. Candi
dates for the Legislature are displaying
considerable energy in rallying their
friends.
Property owners and other good citi
zens of the party can secure conventions
of high character if they will go to the
front this week and join their respective
Assembly district clubs. It is expected
that delegate tickets to be voted foe at
the primary election, August 14, will be
put in the Held by the clubs. It does not
follow, however, that the club nomina
tions must be supported. If racetrack
touts, saloon loafers and other oxponents
of lowdown politics are put In nomination
for delegates to the district or State con
vention, their names should be scratched.
The bes-t way. however, to prevent the
election of unworthy delegates is to pre
vent their nomination. It is the plain
duty of every good Republican to join the
club of the Assembly district in which lie
dwells and then register in time to vote
at the primary election on the second
Tuesday of August next. Af all voters
must register anew in order to vote at the
general election for President and Vice
President next November, the sensible
plan is to register now and make sure of
the right to vote at both the primary
