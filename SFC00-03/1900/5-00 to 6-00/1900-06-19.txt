The change in the situation
was telephoned to Bingham, and
Secretary Long returned the dig

to leave the whole matter in the
hands of the Massachusetts dele

Just what the delegation will do
is to be determined upon to-mor

Governor Roosevelt, after con
ferences late into the night and
all during the day, finally went
the limit and this afternoon gave
out his statement. . It does not
materially affect the situation,
however, and it would not be sur
prising if he were forced to take
the nomination.
Governor Roosevelt's state
ment was taken into Senator
Hanna's room before he gave it
out to the newspapers and was
there read. There were present
besides Senator Hanna, Corne
lius N. Bliss of New York, Sena
tor Fairbanks of Indiana, Henry
C. Payne of Wisconsin and sev

members of the Republican Na

that Senator Hanna gave' out the

PROSPERITY THE KEYNOTE
OF THE PLATFORM.
. ?
PHILADELPHIA, June - 18. â Considerable opposition is developing to some of tbe planks of the adminis
tration draft of the platform brought to Philadelphia * by Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith. v It
is probable that thisdraft will be indorsed in the main by.the committee on resolutions and the convention,
though there will be a lively fight in the committee over several planks, and as is the case at every con
vention, the committee will' be besieged by advocates of 'crank declarations of all kinds.
Prosperity will be the keynote of the platform. The revival of business and general improvement in ; the
condition of the country will be attributed to the restoration of confidence following the. election of McKinley
and to the fulfillment of the pledges of the'platform of 1896 by the enactment of the Dingley tariff law. and the
gold standard financial law. There will be no difference of opinion in the committee or in the convention as to
the emphatic indorsement of both* of these, laws. The' party will be put squarely on record by an indorsement of
the single gold standard as established by the new law.

choice for Vice President is

Another State that will vote
for Roosevelt early in the roll
call, if there. is a roll call, is Colo
rado. Senator Wolcott of that
State, who is to be temporary
chairman of the convention, said
to-day when told that Mr. Hanna
had declared himself in favor of
Long that Colorado would vote
for Roosevelt and nobody could
stop it.
A very curious turn in the
sentiment here has. been that
some of Roosevelt's friends who
were doing^the best they could to
find some way for him to avoid
taking the nomination are now
shouting: that he certainly will be
nominated whether he wants it or
not, and that Mr. Hanna has not
the power to stop the conven
tion. â¢ In brief, the question to
night is will the arch conspira
tors, Quay and Platt, be able to
defeat Hanna?
They are more than ever situ
ated to sympathize with each
other and to need each the as
sistance of the other. Platt, as ; a
boss whose power is threatened
by a rather mugwumpishly in
clined Governor, who is a hero
among other things, feels the ne
cessity of getting a fresh grip
on., the national administration
if "his power is to be preserved.
Quay, now in the category of ex-
bosses with only hold-over ma
chine power, is seeking rehabili
tation. >: "*iy,,
It appears that a majority of
California's delegation are in fa
vor of some Western man for
Vice President, but they will un
doubtedly vote for the adminis
tration's choice.

of Yet Defeating
Roosevelt.
PHILADELPHIA, June 18.
â The Dolliver men to
night are working with des
perate activity. While the Roose
velt boom is in the drydock, they
are trying to get far out to sea.
They have organized into com
mittees and are visiting all State

support of everybody, and are
working intelligently. Hanna's
friends are also at work, and
Long's candidacy is really show

PHILADELPHIA. June
i8.__The Vice Presiden
tial situation to-night is in
as great a doubt as ever by rea
son of Governor Roosevelt's let
ter declining the nomination. His
lack of characteristic vigor, how
ever, still creates the belief in the
minds of his admirers that he
night be prevailed upon to ac
cept the nomination if the con
vention should nominate him. If
he persists in his refusal the nom
ination will go to either Secre
tary Long or Dolliver of Iowa.
The administration has resolved
to put forth its own candidate to
defeat Roosevelt, and no secret
is longer made of the fact that
Secretary Long is the adminis
tration's favorite. This has been
suspected from the start, but
Senator Hanna did not wish to
be placed in the attitude of in
fluencing \he selection of Presi
dent McKinley's running mate.
The Massachusetts men say that
had this choice of the adminis
tration been announced sooner,
Mr. Long might have been nom
inated by acclamation, but that
now there is danger the conven
tion may yet be stampeded to
Roosevelt, despite his letter of
declination. The question is
whether Hanna's announcement
docs not come too late.
The chairman of the Massa
chusetts delegation says if the ad
ministration had come here with
a candidate he would have been
taken without a doubt, but while
the Massachusetts delegation be
lieved that McKinley's choice
was Long, the Iowa men be
lieved just as confidently and on
as good authority that it was
Dolliver. But there was no au
thoritative statement for either
of these men, so the wire pulling
began. Hanna' s hand was
forced, and Roosevelt, who is im
mensely popular with the dele
gates, was picked out as the man
whom it was "good politics" to
nominate;
Of course the announcement
that Senator Hanna had passed
the word along that he wanted
Secretary Long nominated for
Vice President was hailed by
Long's sincere friends with de
light, as they saw in Hanna a
powerful ally. The result was a
stiffening of the Long forces and
the decision to continue the fight
and take his name into the
convention, which latter course

NEW YORK, June 18.â A
World special from Phila

Roosevelt saw and talked with no
less than 400 men to-day. Here
are a few things he said:
'"San Juan was a hard proposi
tion, but this beats it."
. "I want to do what is right by
the -Republican party, bntl hon
estly believe my path of duty lies
in New York State." "
"I want to be Governor of New
York another term, and I don't
want to be nominated for Vice
President. But' the delegates are
forcing me and it is very difficult
to decline."
"If I refuse the nomination
they will say 'Roosevelt has the
big head and thinks he is too
much of a man to be Vice Presi
dent/ I cannot allow myself to
be placed in that position, for I
have not the big head, and I ap
preciate the office of Vice Presi
dent at its true value."
"I have never asserted that I
would decline the nomination."
"I never cross a bridge till I
get to it. but it looks to. me as
though I was approaching a
bridge."
"Xo man is big enough to re

"If the convention sponta

see how I can refuse."
"I believe all men who know
me will accept my statement that
I don't seek the nomination for
Vice President."
"It's hard for a man to resist
such appeals as I have heard, but
I think I am doing right."
After his talk with Hann.i he

ORGANIZING FOR
CONVENTION WORK
And so the stampede for Roosevelt was
checked and turned .and that which
seemed so certain last night seems well
nigh impossible to-night. Roosevelt him
self; his close personal friends working
among delegates and assuring them that
the nomination was not desired by him;
Senator Hanna and his lieutenants, alt
working together, are responsible for this
result. It has been a day of hard work,
of earnest endeavor and to-night the mpn
most interested believe that the Roose
velt boom has finally been laid to rest.
The- answer was generally "John D.
Long of Massachusetts, Secretary of the
Navy." At once delegates began to rea
son that Long must be perfectly satis
tactory to the administration of which he
is part or he would not be a candidate
for the. plaoe. This, idea received en
couragement in quarters which made the
Massachusetts man a prime favorite. Of
course there was talk of other men. The
friends of Doillver renewed their efforts
for "the young Iowa orator. . There was
some talk about Fairbanks, but the pre
vailing feeling was that only men who
were willing to accept the place should
be considered. It was urged that an un
willing candidate was not advisable, and,
therefore, the men most talked of were
Long and Dolliver, but with the general
impression that Long would be the ultir
mate selection.
Rf fight and a signal to the friends of the
administration that opposition to forcing
Roosevelt upon the ticket against his will
would meet 'with favor. This tip did not
circulate until quite late in the evening,
but the effect was soon apparent. There
were many real friends of Roosevelt who
accepted his declaration as absolutely
voicing his .wish. It changed the current
of talk and men who were confident twen
ty-four hours ago that Roosevelt's nom
ination was a foregone conclusion begjn
asking:
"Weir, who will it be?'"' .

ROOSEVELT MAKES
ONE LAST 0PPEAL
flgain Protests Against Be-
ir>g Nominated For
Vice President.
PHILADELPHIA. June 18.-Governor
Theodore Roosevelt has made as specillo
refusal of the nomination for Vice i'risi
dt:u as he could possibly make in view or
the fact that the nominating convention
has not as yet met and that few of the
delegations have caucused. Standing In
a small room, facing a crowd of newspa
per men this afternoon, he made the fol
lowing statement, reading it from a
couple of sheets of manuscript:
"In view of the revival of the talk of
myself as a Vice Presidential candidate,
I have this to say:
"It is impossible to express how deeply
touched I am by the attitude of those
The nomination for Vice President Is
three days away. Much can be accom
plished In that time by shrewd, hard
headed political leaders. The delegates
are all desirous of carrying out the Presi
dent's wishes, and if the intimation once
became the conviction that McKlnley
himself would prefer another candidate
thÂ« popular choice would be abandoned.
Mr. Platt very shrewdly decided that the
New York delegation should not formally
Indorse Roose\-elt_ It is said that Roose
velt insisted upon this. Then If he were
nominated it would be said that the nomi
nation was forced on him. Rut while the
New York delegation refrained from In
dorsing Roosevelt, Platt Is said to have
passed the word to Quay and the Pennsyl
vania delegation to continue to fan the
flames.
All day the delegates and the crowds
werÂ« abandoning themselves to the joys
of the hour. From dawn untii midnight
thÂ« air never ceased to throb to the pulsa
tions of the music, and the streets con
stantly echoed the steady tramp of feet as

ing banners. To-night the throngs were
enthusiastic with delight As a prelude
to the events, with the flash. and scream
of rockets and the . glare -of ' Greek flre.
turning night Into day, 30,000 organized
Much May Happen In ThreÂ« Days.
Of course, there are those who are al
ways uncharitable enough to attribute
finister motives to Platt. They Intimated
that he desired to kill two birds with one
stoneâ eliminate Roosevelt from New
York politics and humiliate Hanna for
his uncomplimentary criticism of Wood
ruff. Gossip among New Yorkers even
went so far as to suggest that with
Roosevelt transferred to the national
ticket Woodruff was already agreed upon
as the candidate for Governor of New
York. Roosevelt had also other advisors,
who Insisted that it would be suicide to
decline the nomination. All day long
Hanna's efforts have been directed to the
rebuilding of the booms wrecked yester
day In the Roosevelt tornado. All the fa
vorite sons have been encouraged to re
main in the race, and not without some
success.
Many Stories Are Afloat.
Evrry sort of story was afloat. It was
paid that Hanna served notice that Roose
velt's candidacy, although It would have
been eminently acceptable at first, put
forward as it was by the enemies of the
administration, did not meet now with ap
proval, and thjLt the fight would be car
ried to the last ditch. Roosevelt was Baid
to have been told by his friends that to
yield would be to stand in his own light
as a candidate for President four years
hence; that the Vice Presidency was a
graveyard, from which he could never be
resurrected. His place, they urged, was
at the head of the ticket in New York
again this fall. In the last proposition
Roosevelt concurred. On the orher hand.
It was said Piatfs emissaries argued that
to turn his back on the manifest wish of
the Republicans of the country would be
to forfeit his right to the future support
of the New York organization and the Re
publicans of the State might look else
where for a candidate for Governor.
Human naiure has its limits, so at 4
o'clock this afternoon, after a day of ter
rific pressure from both sides, Roosevelt
issued a statement. Though ft thrust
aside the crown In words it was regarded
as a virtual surrender to the will of the
convention. The inside history of the
Ftrug-gle which preceded Roosevelt's an
nouncement, the st-cret conference of
Hanna and his friends, the joint confer
ences with Roosevelt, the persuasion, ap
peals, entrr-aties and even threats that
â¢were said to have been used will make a
chapter forever memorable.
The Governor himself was sincerely
anxious to avoid the nomination. Some
of the friends of other candidates, em
bittered by the havoc his sudden accept
ance created with their favorites' chances,
were heard to intimate that he had been
fining with the situation from the first.
He appealed to them to stem the tide and
they did what they could, reinforced at
every point by Hanna and his lieutenants.
General Greene in his behalf even called
upon delegations and In his r.ame asked
them not to support him. But the tem
per of the convention was undeniable.
Anxious to Avoid Nomination.
S-weeps I/ike a Prairie Fire.
But that outburst of enthusiasm will be
only the forerunner of the pandemonium
that will reign If Roosevelt should be
name-d to stand beside him In the coming
battle. The stampede in his favor started
yesterday and threw the town into deUr
lum. It swept through the delegations
like a prairie flre. Like an Immense tidal
wave, it 'bore down everything before it.
The booms for other men collapsed like
shells when it struck them. The secret
was not hard to fir.d. Platt and Quay,
whose object was to humiliate Hanna.
claim victory- They might congratulate
themselves that it was their work. But
they wielded no magician's war.d. The
secret lay down In the hearts of the Ke
publicar.s of the country. Roosevelt"*
came, unlike that of other candidates. In
stantly struck a responsive chord In the
popular breast. It captured the heart of
the convention. It mattered nothing to
the rank and file that Hanna and Allison
and Grosvenor and Thurston and others
felt chagrined and strained every nerve
to stamp out the fire. It mattered not
that even Roosevelt and his friends
poured water upon it. Their efforts were
as futile as hand grenades against a con
flagration. The people would hear of no
one else. They wore his pictures; they
ehcuted his name. They considered him
to-day as already nominated. The town
was Roosevelt mad.

John C. Fremont was nominated by

amid the swelling memories of half a cen
tury ajid in the presence of men who saw
the blood-stained clouds I'e across the
Funrise of the party, the Republicans will
meet in the high tide of their glory to

portrait and the mention of his name
arouses enthusiasm. When Senator Fora

tempestuous, will shake the great halL
under the existing "conditions the nomina
tion of Roosevelt was not fair to the men
who had come out for the place and who
should have an equal show before the
convention.
This plain talk from Senator Hanna
cleared up what had been in doubt all
day. It was evident that Hanna was not
going: to He down. It was a distinct show
As the Ohio Senator rehearsed the con
ditions he warmed up and pointed out that
"And 1 don't mean by that," he said,
rather aggressively, "the Pennsylvania
delegation or those who for ulterior mo
tives are pressing the Governor's'nomina
tion."
Then Mr. Quigg and Frank * Platt
simultaneously .- declared that they be
lieved the statement unwise and they
left the room, refusing to talk to the wait
ing newspaper men. The statement acted
aa a cold water douche on those members
of the New York delegation who had
planned to nominate some other candidate
for Governor than Mr. Roosevelt. How
ever, tie statement was received by many
of the delegations as a mere reiteration
of Roosevelt's'original declaration of lack
of desire fÂ«5r the nomination. Â¦ Several
delegates expressed the opinion that the
situation would not change and that If
Roosevelt's name were presented to the
convention he would be nominated and
would not dare to refuse.
It is pointed out as significant that Gov
ernor Roosevelt will not assert that he
will declire the office If nominated. He
hopes, however, with the aid of Senator
Hanna, to defeat the plan to nominate
him.
Senator Lodge contradicts the current
report concerning his, utterances at tne
conference in Governor Roosevelt's rooms
to-day in which he participated with the
Governor and Senator Hanna. He says
â¢ that he went to Governor Roosevelt's
room as a supporter of Secretary Long
and that the Governor knew his position.
"I have been a personal friend of Gov
ernor Roosevelt for many years," he said,
"and as his friend. It would be tmpossi

in my mouth. He does not want the office

It has been a day of conferences on
the Vice Presidential situation. Beginning
with a gathering In the room of Governor
Roosevelt, attended by Senator Hanna,
Senator Lodge and Mr. Odell of New
York, It was continued In the rooms of
Senator Hanna later when nearly all the
leaders In the city were from time to time
in conference with the chairman of the
national committee. There were Senators
Allison, Scott, Elklns, Carter. Lodge, Bur
rows and Shoup, Mr. -Bliss and many rep
resentatives of the New York leaders,
both Governor Roosevelt and Senator
Platt being represented. When the last
man* had disappeared Senator Hanna
looked weary but satisfied. He was ready
to annbunce that Governor Roosevelt
would not be nominated, that the men
who were goin"- to make the nomination
would accept the declaration of Roose
velt, made during the day and supple
mental of more emphatic declarations
made some time ago as final and would
not force the nomination upon him.
Among the last men to see 'Senator
Hanna were Chairman Odell of the New
York committee and L. E. Quigg, who
discussed the situation at great length.
It was with these men j that Senator
Hanna labored. He told them that six
months ago Roosevelt was wanted as a
Vice Presidential candidate. He and
other warm friends of the administration
believed that Roosevelt would be a satis
factory candidate. The bare suggestion
brought o.ut a protest from Roosevelt, a
declaration in emphatic terms that ho
would not accept the place. After this
declaration had been reiterated several
times it was taken up by Senator Platt,
who publicly announced that Governor
Roosevelt was not to be considered as a
Vice Presidential candidate. Then other
candidates appeared and- In a dignified
manner their interests were put forward
by their friends throughout the country.
The only man appearing in New York
was Lieutenant Governor Woodruff. Tha
suggestion of ex-Secretary Bliss brought
forth a declination from him, coupled
later with a statement from Mr. Hanna
himself that Bliss could not be considered
for personal . reasons, He then pointed
out that after the delegates began arriv
ing the name of Roosevelt was suddenly
sprung with an effort to stampede the
convention and force a nomination upon
a man who did not want It," apparently
because some other candidate was desired
for Governor.
politicians. When he finished he said:
"Gentlemen, that is all. I have nothing
more to say."
Mr. t Littauer said he thought the state
ment timelv and believed that It would
give the delegates who were friendly to
Governor Roosevelt an idea of the situa
tion.

CLUBS IN LINE

.PHILADELPHIA. June IS.â Five miles
of clubs, mounted, on foot, by coach,
floats and In carriages, interspersed with
music, red fire and cakewaik. Is the short
est way of describing the turnout of po
litical clubs to-night. The police had pre
pared for the demonstration by roping
Broad street early In the afternoon. It
was a wise forethought, for before dusk
Philadelphia's appropriately named thor
oughfare was a mass of humanity, and
It has been many years since the police
of Philadelphia have >een called upon
to handle such banks of humanity as lined
the route of the parade. Visitors from
cities where the police have great crowds
to handle were profuse in praise of Phila
delphia's police to-night.
An amusing feature of the parade â and.
by the way, an Innovationâ was an Inter
larded Cakewalk in the column. The char
acters were -.colored men, women and
children attired in costume made more
attractive by the torches of red tire.
In the prearrangement of to-night's pa
radeAit had been decided in spite of an
expressed sentiment by many of the clubs
to permit nothing In the line antagonistic
to the civil service. There were, how
ever, two violations of the order. On one
transparency mounted on wagons was
this motto, "The Civil Service law dis
qualifies all over the age of 45." On an
other, carried by a club on foot, was this,
"We are opposed to the Civil Service
law because it is unamerican."
The only demonstration in the line in
behalf of Vice Presidential candidates was
displayed by one club of twenty stream
ers, on which "Dolliver" was painted in
big letters.
The parade was divided into eight di
visions, in which were more than eighty
local clubs and about twenty visiting po
litical organizations. The out-of-town
clubs were scattered through eight sec
tions and escorted by the clubs which
had been assigned to entertain visiting
clubmen. Conspicuous In line were the
famous Cook County Republican March
ing Club of Chicago, the Young Men's
Republican Tariff Club of Pittsbiirg. the
Young Men's Elaine Club of Cincinnati,
the Hamilton Club of Chicago, the "Mc-
Kinley Neighbors" from Canton, Ohio;
the Blalne Invincibles of Washington, the
J. Edward Addicks Club of Wilmington.

sinrSeyTlnsure Good Heal,
Mr. John H. Corlies, secretary of the Council Bluffs. la.. Athletic Association,
was cured of kidney trouble by Peruna. He says:
"I am a firm believer in Peruna: For three years I suffered with severe
trouble of the kidneys and other pelvic organs, trying several remedies
without relief. I used Paruna faithfully for fourteen weeks and am glad to
say it relieved me entirely of all pains. '
" I am in excellent health, have gained twelve pounds in weight, and
never felt better in my life."
Hon. D. L. Jaycox, chaplain of the Grand Army of the Republic, writes from
8C5 Broadway, Oakland, Cal.:
" I am an old war vataran. I contracted severe bladder and kidney
trouble, spent hundreds of dollars and consulted a host of doctors, but
neither did me any good. .
" Finally some of my comrades who had been cured by Peruna advised
me to try it. I at once bought a bottle and found it helped ma so much*
that I kept on using it for nearly four months.
" Peruna has proven the best medicine I ever used, my pains are gone,
and I believe myself to be cured. I feel well and would not be without a
bottle in time of need for ten times its cost."
The kidneys are tho natural gateway
out of which much of the waste tissue
finds its escape. This waste matter be-
comes a very poisonous substance if al-
lowed to accumulate. The renal artery
brings the blood charged with Impurities
to the kidneys.
If the kidneys are healthy they will
excrete the poison from the blood. The
renal veins return the purified blood from
the kidneys to the general circulation.
Peruna stimulates the kidneys to excrete
from the blood tho accumulating poison
and thus prevents the convulsions which
are sure to follow If the poisons are al-
lowed to remain. It gives great vigor to
the heart's action and digestive system,
both of which are apt to fall rapidly in
this disease.

He had no preference as to who should

The sub-committees appointed by the
Massachusetts delegation to canvass all
the States in the interest of Secretary
Long for the Vice Presidency made their
reports th!s afternoon. ThÂ» committee
deputed to look over the New . England
field reported that every State in that sec

States were to the effect in general that

ocatep of Illinois, as well as many of the
delegates from the rest of the State, lean

would vote for the Far Western candi

among the Northern States east of the

Governor Taylor is accompanied by his
wife, and the two keep to their rooms
much of the time. Members of the party
say the Kentucky authorities who hold
a â¢warrant for Mr. Taylor are following
his movements from State to State, but no
fear is expressed that the matter will be
brought up while he is here. -The Gover
nor himself told his friends . he had not
been annoyed on the trip here and did not
expect to have any trouble. When the
matter was referred to at the Kentucky
headquarters it evoked heated denuncia
tion of the "conspiracy" against Taylor,
and expressions of sturdy loyalty to him.
"Kentucky wants to compliment Gover
nor Bradley by having his name consid
ered for tne Vice Presidency. After that
the sentiment seems strongest for Roose
velt, if he will accept, with no definite
choice among the other candidates."
Governor Taylor and Governor Bradley
are the two central figures of the Ken
tucky delegation, which has quarters at
the Continental. The delegation is aug
mented by the McKinley Club of Louis
ville, with a big band, which keeps things
lively. Delegate W. p. Rosa summed up
the feeling thus:
The Kansas delegation, the North Da
kota delegation and the South Dakota
delegation sent the same kind of mess
ages, showing- that the tide toward a
stampede was being partially stemmed.
However, it was appreciated, that the
sentiment was not by any means crushed
out and that It misht without careful
management still overwhelm the unwill
ing Roosevelt.
"We want to assure you that while
we want your name on the ticket, we will
respect your wishes in the matter."
"I believe that the delegations that are
really friendly to me will not vote for
me, but will respect my wishes."
Even as he spoke a delegation from
Oregon came in and the spokesman said:
In Governor Roosevelt's room the at
mosphere of doubt had somewhat cleared
away. Governor Roosevelt himself said:
More decidedly in keeping with this view
of the matter were the threats of the less
guarded of the delegation that "if Gover
nor Roosevelt does not accept the Vice
Presidency he will not be nominated for
Governor and will, be retired to private
life."
"Yes, I think so."

him. There -were enough remarks dropped
to make it evident that the leaders of
the New York delegation were convinced
that Governor Roosevelt's statement has
disposed of his candidacy. To Mr. Flatt
this question was proposed:
"Can Mr. Roosevelt be defeated for the

night saying that the Ninth Infantry had
been ordered to Manila for service in
China exposed the secret plans of the
War Department to dispatch troops to
tho scene of trouble In China. Secret or
ders were sent to General MacArthur a
few days ago to prepare for the prompt
dispatch of troops to Taku, but it was
not Intended that the matter should he-
"A dispatch from Tausslg, dated Che
foo, June 17, says that the Taku forts
fired on the foreign gun vessels at 12:45
In the morning and reports that the Brit
ish admiral Is at Tientsin."
"The department has received a cable
gram from Admiral Remey at Cavite,
dated June 18, that Informs the depart
ment that Commander Tausslg cables
that the Taku forts at the mouth of the
river Pelho fired on the foreign gun
vessels and surrendered to the allied
forces on the morning of the 17th. The
department has instructed Admiral
Kempff to concur with the other powers
in taking all steps necessary to protect
all American interests.
WASHINGTON, June 18.â The actual
news of the situation In China was re
ceived by the Navy Department in two
cablegrams, the contents of which were
made known as follows:
KEMPFF GIVEN AN
INDEPENDENT COMMAND
the naval commanders held a council and
decided to send an ultimatum calling for
the rlisbandment of the troops arid an
nouncing that if this demand were not
complied with before 2 a. m. of the fol
lowing day the united squadron would
destroy the forts. Shortly after midnight
the forts opened lire. The British, Krench,
Russian. German and Japanese warships
replied until two of the forts were blown
up and the rest wore carried by assault.
Two British, one American and five Chi
nese warships are in Chefoo harbor."
The morning papers consider that a
state of war practically exists. The Times
says that the latest news Indefinitely in
creases a situation already sufficiently
serious.
â Â¦ Â»
come puonc until the movement was at
least under way. Now that the matter
leaked out from Manila, the officials of
the department admit that the adminis
tration has concluded to send troops to
China, for the protection of the and
property of American citizens.
The following cable message fromJGen
eral MacArthur bearing on this subject
was made public at the War Department
this morning:
"Ninth Infantry, Colonel Liscum, or-
"On the afternoon of June 16, in view
of the large bodies of Chinese troops as
sembling at the forts and of the facts that
torpedoes had been laid in the river and
that all communications were interrupted,
The Shanghai correspondent of tho
Times under yesterday's date gives tho
following description, said to be from offi
cial sources, of the action at Taku:
"Russia has massed 40,000 men, with
seven batteries of artillery, at Kiahkta,
with orders to proceed to Maimatchin, a
Chinese town contiguous to Kiahkta, and
thence to advance along the telegraph
route to the Mongol town of Urga. 200
miles south of Kiahkta and 750 miles
northwest of Peking."
The Brussels correspondent of the
Standard, in a dispatch dated yesterday,
says: â¢ '";:
More Russians have been ordered from
Port Arthur to Taku. This reinforce
ment, says the St. Petersburg correspond
ent of the Daily Telegraph, Is announced
In the St_ Petersburg Gazette, the Gov
ernment pointing out that Russia is send
ing so many troops solely for the sake
of peace and humanity.
The failure of Admiral Seymour's col
umn and Its retreat to Tientsin Increase,
it is presumed, the peril of the legations
In Peking, which Is still isolated, although
Shanghai forwards Chinese rumors that
the legations were attacked by mobs who
were mowed down by machine guns, and
also that the members of the legations
were massacred. The situation at Niu
Chwar.g Is reported critical.
The British Consul at Kiukang has or
dered all of the foreigners to leave Ku
ling and Naukingchang. The powers are
taking prompt , action. Four thousand
German troops have been ordered to
China, 10,000 French troops are waiting to
embark at Saigno, capital of French
Cochin China, and from 3000 to 5000 more
Russians have been ordered from Port
Arthur to Taku.
"Two of the forts were blown up. The
thirty-two warships at Taku aggregated
two hundred thousand tons and carried
more than 300 guns."
"Four hundred Chinese are reported
killed. The Chinese, when retreating, fell
Into the hands of the Russian land forces."
The Daily News has the following from
.Chefoo:
"The heavy Russian losses were due to
the blowing up of the magazines of Mand
shur.
orders from Peking conveyed in the per
sonal edict of the Empress Dowager, by
advice of Kang Yl (president of the Min
istry of War). Several- warships were
struck by shells from the twelve-inch
puns of the forts.

WEI L INSTRUCTED FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS BY FOREIGN OFFICERS. THE ARMAMENT OF THE TAKU FORTS CONSISTS OF VERY HEAVY
KRT-PP GUNS, AND THE APPROACHES TO THE FORTS FROM THE GULF OF PECHILI ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. THE FORTIFICATIONS
CONSIST OF THREE FORTSâ A LARGE ONE ON THE RIGHT BANK AND TWO SMALLER ONES ON THE LEFT. ALL OF THE FORTS ARE ARMED
WITH NUMEROUS GUNS OF THE MOST VARIED SYSTEMS AND CALIBERS. IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FORTS OF THE SECOND ZONE THE
MUDDY CLAY SOIL OF THE COAST WAS USED. WHICH. DURING THE DRY SEASON. BECOMES CRACKED AND CRUMBLES VERY EASILY, AND
THE GARRISON IS CONTINUALLY MAKING REPAIRS. IN TAKU ARE THE MATERIALS FOR CLOSING UP THE MOUTH OF THE PEIHO. ALX.

NEW YORK, Jun- 18.â
While, as claimed by the Chin
ese Minister at Washington,
technically a state of war does
not exist between China and
the Western powers, open hos
tilities have occurred, with the
immediate result of the sub
jection of the Taku forts and
speedy prospects of a march
upon Peking by a large inter
national force. Fire was
opened by the Chinese forts
upon foreign vessels off Taku
on Sunday. Their bombard
ment and surrender followed.
PARIS, June 18. â The
gravity of the situation in
China is now fully recognized,
and the Paris morning papers
demand energetic steps for the
protection of the interests of
French citizens. The measures
taken by M. Delcasse, the For
eign Minister, are unanimous
ly approved, but the general
feeling now is that, as the
Chinese question is in one
aspect exclusively French, the
Government should do much
more.
FRENCH SKIPS FOR CHINA.
PARIS, June IS.â The French first-class
cruiser Guichen and the French armored
cruiser Airal Charner have been ordered
to fit out immediately for China.
SHANGHAI, Juno 19.â Four hundred
Chinese were killed In the attack on the
Taku forts. The attackers numbered 2000.
chiefly Russians, but included Americans.
British, Italian, German, Japanese.
French and Austrian3. The fire of th^
forts was at first directed at the gunboats
Yorktown, Algerine and Iltin. Alandshur
(Russian) and Atage (Japanese). Several
were struck by shells. A 12-inch shell
exploded In the Mandshur'a magazine and
the vessel was blown up. The Algerine
and Iltis were badly damaged, each being
struck many times. The commander of
the Iltis was mortally wounded.
Â¦WASHINGTON. June IS.â The Instruc
tions sent to Admiral KempfT relative to
his participation In the seizure of the
Taku forts were broad, consisting of di
rection to protect all American interestn
and to that end to act concurrently with
the representatives of other powers. The
sole condition was that, in his judgment,
his acts should tend to the protection of
American interests. It was learned at
the British embassy this afternoon that
there were two British admirals In Peiho
River, Admiral Seymour and Admiral
Bruce. Therefore Tausslg's reference to
the arrival of the British admiral at Tien
tain does not mean necessarily that Sey
mour has returned with his foreign col
umn. Incl'ided in the detachment of 100
marines with the international expedition
sent to the relief of foreign residents at
Peking are the following well-known of
ficers of the marine corps: Major I* W.
T. "Weller and Lieutenants R. F. TV'lnne,
G. C. Reid. A. E. Harding. H. Leonard and
N. L. Jolly.

this stasre. Secretary Hay was asked If
the latest developments liad made any
chansre in thr policy which the Unite.1
States has adcpted toward these Chinese
troubles. He replied:
"Our naval forces In that region havs
been directed to act concurrently with the
forces of the other powers for the pro
tection of al* American Interests."
Owing to the eccentric action *of the
telegraphic wires and cables which Inter
feres with Admiral Kempff communicat
ing with the Navy Department and also
with his superior officer. Admiral Remey
at Manila, the Navy Department to-day
gave Admiral Kempff an Independent
command in the interests of quick dis
patch of business. There has been no
friction whatever between the two ad
mirals and the commander in chief of
the station. Admiral Remey, has lent due
support to Admiral Kempff during the
crisis.
Great apprehension exists at the Navy
Department as to the fate of the United
States marine guard of fifty-six men
which were landed at Tientsin and dis
patched by rail to Peking before the rail
road was interrupted. They went for
ward to Peking under authorization given
by the Chinese Government to the United
States Minister at Peking, In common
with other ministers, to employ a a naval
guard at the legation. Just before the
wires from Peking were cut word came
that Minister Conger had detached twenty
of these marines from his legation and
placed them as a guard at the Methodist
compound.
The Navy Department has made public
the text of the two cablegrams received
from Admiral Remey and Commander
Tausslg. The first Is as follows:
"CHEFOO. June 17.â Taku forts tired
upon foreign vessels about 12:45 a. m.
"CAVITE, June 18.-9:40 A. M.â Bureau
of Navigation, Washington. Taussig ca
bles that Taku forts fired upon foreign
gun vessels and then surrendered to the
allied forces the morning of June 17.
Kempft asks instructions about joining
other powers who are taking united action
In demanding that the Taku forts be
turned over to them to secure favorable
termination of the trouble. "Will the de
partment instruct Kempff and give me
the same Information? REMET.'"
The telegram from Commander Tausstg
of the Yorktown is as follows:
dered to Taku on Logan; transportation
Port Albert: probably start 24th. Ty
phoon delays movement."
The voyage from Manila to Taku will
occupy at least a week.
The State Department this morning re
ceived a cablegram from United States
Consul Goodnow at Shanghai repeating
the news previously conveyed to the Navy
Department by Admiral Remey and Com
mander Tauasig. The officials here are
puzzled by Tausslg's statement that the
British admiral has arrived at Tientsin.
They did not know that more than one
British admiral was in the Peiho River,
and that was Admiral Seymour, who led
the international relief column toward
Peking. If it is this admiral who has re
turned to Tientsin, then the assumption
is that the relief column has failed and
has been compelled to retreat to Tien
tsin This assumption would explain the
statement brought by the Japanese tor
pedo boat that the foreign legations at
Peking had been taken, for that is the
only manner in which the news could
have reached. Tientsin. In this case, it
is said, nothing can be done for the re
lief of foreign Ministers at Peking, sup
posing they are still alive, until a very
much stronger relief column can bo
formed and marched overland to Peking.
"Weeks must elapse before this can be ac
complished. The Ninth Infantry Regi
ment represents all of the army which
it is proposed at present to employ. Col
onel Liscum has been ordered to report to
the United States Consul at Tientsin.
It Is difficult to get a precise official
view of the status of our relations with
China since 'this last news. The conclu
sion that we are in a state of war is em
phatically negatived by the officials best
competent to speak. The Chinese Minis
ter, Wu, was an early visitor to the State
Department to-day. He does not believe
that we are at war with China. He said
that there iiad been a great misunder
standing and he was confident th'at if
the Taku forts had fired upon the inter
national fleet it was either because the
commander of the Chinese forts there did
not understand what was wanted or he
had failed to receive proper Instructions
from his superior through an error.
Herr von Holleben, the German Embas
sador, was without official information.

vailed that the r c had beer, a bombH.'ii

LONDON, June 19â3:30 A. M.â China
declared war against the world
when the Taku forts opened lire up
on the international fleet. The ac
counts of what took place are still
unsatisfactory, the 'best semi-official In
formation being the dispatch received at
Berlin from Chefoo.
The German Consul at Chefoo tele-
Kraphs that a Japanese torpedo boat from
Taku has brought the following:
"The Chinese laid torpedoes in the Taku
River and collected troops from Shanhei
kwan. The foreign commanders assem
bled on the Russian flagship and address
ed an ultimatum to the commanders of
the Taku forts, summoning them to with
draw their troops before 2 o'clock June 17.
At la. m. June 17 the guns of the forts
opened fire, to which the Russian, Brit
ish, French and Japanese warships re
plied. The bombardment lasted seven
hours. Two British ships in the river
between the forts are reported to have
been Bunk. The telegTaph line and rail
road between Tientsin and Taku was de
stroyed. Communication by water Is also
threatened."
Later a semi-official dispatch from Che
foo announced that the Taku forts had
been captured after a combined attack
by the foreign warships. Three men on
the German warship lltls were killed and
seven were wounded.
The dispatch added that the foreign
settlements at Tientsin were being tired
Into by the Chinese.
When the dispatch left nothing had been
heard from the German detachment sent
to Peking or from the German legation
there.
The unofficial narratives coming by way
of Shanghai vary and bear evidence of
supplementing the main facts with guess
work. One dispatch says the Yorktown
participated in the bombardment. An
other asserts that American marines
formed part of the storming force of 2000.
An Associated Press dispatch from Che
foo, dated yesterday srfternoon, says:
The forts on both sides of Taku are
now occupied. The Chinese opened tire
unexpectedly. The casualties to the
mixed force were as follows:
Killed â British 1, German 3, Rus
sian 1 and French 1.
Wounded â British 4, German 7,
Russian 45 and French 1.

The second letter was from the Chinese
Merchants' Exchange of this city and was
as follows:
The President, Washington. D. C. : Dr. Kln
youn, the Federal quarantine offlcer of this
port, claiming to act- under your authority, has
unreasonably and unnecessarily quarantined
this State In opposition to my full and fair re
port to the Honorable Secretary of State, un
der date of June 14. 1&00. and alsoâ among other
things â in opposition to the opinion of Judge
Morrow of the" United States Court, rendered
yesterday, dissolving the quarantine.
Through Dr. Kinyoun's conduct In the past,
as well as his present action, the reputation of
the State, the rights of citizens, as well as the
rights of foreign subjects, are outrageously im
paired. *.
I am Informed that Dr. Klnyoun transmitted
dispatches yesterday to Washington through of
ficial channels wherein are contained unwar
ranted statements and Improper reflections. He
has been advised by the United States District
Attorney that his course Is unjustifiable and he
refuses to withdraw his last order of general
quarantine without further instructions from
Washington.
On behalf of the people of California. I re
spectfully protest against his actions, and re
quest immediate relief for the people of this
State, the traveling public and the commercial
Interest of the coast. Your most obedient, hum
ble servant, . HENRY T. GAGE.
Governor -of the State of California.
Before the welcome news was received
yesterday from Washington that the na
tional authorities had taken steps to stop
the outrage committed by Dr. Kinyoun's
arrogant action two letters of importance
were sent to President McKinley. One of
these epistles was from Governor Gage
and Is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 16, 19C0.
VIGOROUS APPEALS
TO THE PRESIDENT
With regard to the rumor of the existence of
bubonic plague in your city this office is not
responsible for the report. Respectfully yours,
J. J. KINTOUN. Surgeon M. H. S.
Dr P. K. Watters. Watsonville. Cal.â Dear
Doctor: * In response to your verbal request ot
this date relative to an Inspection made by my
assistant. Dr. B. J. Lloyd. M. H. S.. I takÂ»
pleasure in infonninjr you that his report states
that the health of the town is excellent and
there was no case of bubonic plague nor anv
evidence of the disease existing at the time of
his inspection. The health of the people so far
8 s could be ascertained was excellent. Only
one death had occurred among the Chinese pop
ulation for six weeks, and that was from cli
rhosls of the liver.
Dr. J. J. Klnyoun, the discredited quar
antine offlcer, Is as eager now to make
amends for his outrageous actions as he
was before to enforce his arbitrary and
unwarranted commands. When he 'placed
the State under quarantine rumors,
adroitly circulated from his office, were
given out that a suspicious case of plaguo
had been discovered at Watsonville. The
Call Instituted an Immediate investiga
tion and proved the gross injustice of the
rumors. Â¦ '
And now Dr. Kinyoun. in the follow
ing letter. 13 forced to admit the fact:
Office of Medical Officer In Command. Marine
Hospital Service. San Francisco Quarantine:
San Francisco. Cal., June 18. 1300.

ON WATSONVILLE
and districts provoked a spirited discus
sion. D'Ancona wanted the resolution re
ferred to a committee, but Brandenstein
opposed the reference and advised Instant
action. . :'Â¦-'.'Â¦ . .
"We want to advertise the fact, said
Brandenstein, "that the Board of Health
has specifically and emphatically declared
that there Is no occasion for a quarantine
at the present time."
Tho ordinance was then unanimously
passed to print.
Mr. McCarthy is of the opinion that the
Board of Supervisors was bluffed Into
serving the ends of the Board of Health,
and he minces no words in saying so.
"When they came to us at the meeting of
May 29." he said last evening, "they told
us that if Chinatown were not quaran
tined the whole city would be quaran
tined, and that It would be better for the
city to have the Chinese kept in detention
than to have the whole population placed
under the ban. They had used the same
argument on the merchants and the mer
chants came to back up their demand, so
we agreed to It. "We did not know at the
time that they had been to the Governor,
or at least that the State Board had been
to the Governor, and that he had abso
lutely refused to consider a quarantine of
the city.
"They knew that without the Governor's
sanction they could not be quarantined,
but Ftill they came to us and threatened
us with a quarantine of the city If we did
not allow them to tie up Chinatown. \v e
passed the order under the impression
that we were saving the city from a great
deal; we did not know that the city was
In no danger and that the Board of Health
was forcing us into supporting them by
a threat they knew was a hollow one.
"My resolution asking the Board of
Health to resign is gaining in strength
and it will not be long before it passes.
A week ago I was the only one to vote for
it; this week I have five votes, and I
would have had two more, only when I
asked for them those two men said they
had appointees working in Chinatown and
they were not going to vote against their
Interests. Â¦
"The whole thing has been a bluff even
so far back as last March. In March, when
we fought against giving the Health
Board all the money they thought they
could possibly use and reduced the
amount to $20,000, Williamson said to one
of the Supervisors: 'They have Oriental
plague In Honolulu now; take care that
we don't get it here.' It was a threat, for
In a few days after the Board of Health
reported their first case."

tion as to whether they had been exposed to
contagion or infection, and all applications by
Asiatics for permission to travel wer* arbitrar

I F DR. KINYOUN IS TO COMPLY WITH ANY ORDERS," SAID JUDGE MOR-
I ROW, "HE IS TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDERS OF THIS COURT. I DE
SIRE TO STATE THAT. NO AGREEMENT OF COUNSEL CAN REMOVE THE
CASE FROM THIS CALENDAR. IT MUST REMAIN HERE TO BE DISPOSED
OF, AND THE DEFENDANT MUST ANSWER WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS
DISOBEYED THE ORDER OF THIS COURT, AND IF HE HAS DONE SO HE
MUST BE PUNISHED. NO CONTINUANCE WILL BE RECOGNIZED THAT
CONTEMPLATES A DISPOSITION OF THE MATTER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS
IT WOULD BE SUPPOSED THE COURT\WOULD OVERLOOK THE OFFENSE.
THERE IS NO HIGHER POWER OR AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD; THERE
IS NO APPEAL FROM IT."
"I would suggest," said D'Ancona, "that
the board investigate the authority of Dr
Klnyoun in quarantining the State. Aside
from the question of the existence or non
existence of the plague, I believe that
Kinyoun had no authority to interfere In
State matters unless ordered to do so un
der some rule or regulation issued by the
Secretary of the Treasury."
Brandenstein desired to introduce a res
olution calling upon Kinyoun to explain
his position. , but it developed that the
board had no power to act in the prem
ises. . .

The motion to suspend the rules was
lost, Fontana, Helms, McCarthy and
Reed alone voting aye. The resolution
was referred to the Committee on Judi
ciary after D'Ancona opposed the refer
ence to the Committee on -Health.
"The Board of Health has placed itself
In a peculiar position to say the least. By
its questionable methods In declaring 1 the
existence of a plague, which to my mind
and in the opinion of a large number of
citizens, never existed at all; by the se
crecy which characterized its every move
and the fact that the assistance of medi
cal men was never asked;, by its establish
ment of a reckless quarantine, which has
done incalculable injury to the commun
ity; for all these and many other reasons
I say that they are a discredited body and
they ought to resign of their own accord
Instead of being called upon to do so. .1
move that the rules be suspended and the
resolution be taken up for immediate ac
tion." Â¦..;> .
Resolved, That the Board of Health no
longer has the support and confidence of this
Board of Supervisors, and for the best interests
of the community at large we deem the re
moval of its members from their office nec
essary, and the Mayor Is earnestly requested
to see that their offices are declared vacant
forthwith.
In presenting his resolution McCarthy
said:
Whereas. The recent quarantine has been
held to be wrongful and oppressive, the Chinese
people may have a claim against the United
States Government for a violation of their
treaty rights, which may amount to hundreds
of thousands of dollars and which eventually
this city may be called upon to pay; therefore
be it
Whereas, It now appears that the State
Board ot Health could not quarantine this city
without the sanction of the Governor, and the
Governor had already refused to approve such
a measure, therefore the argument that the
entire city was In danger of quarantine was
maliciously and falsely made to this Board of
Supervisors as the Board of Health at that
time well knew that the State Board of Health
had tried and failed to quarantine this city, ow
ing to the good common sense of our Governor;
and
Whereas, The said Board of Health used
as an argument before this Board of Super
visors, to induce this board to authorize them
to quarantine the CTilnese quarter, the asser
tion that if the Chinese quarter was not so
quarantined, then, and in that event, the State
Board of Health would quarantine the entire
city, and they thereby Induced reputable mer
chants to appear before this board and petition
this board to quarantine the Chinese quarter
as the lesser of two evils, and not because they
believed there was plague in the city; and
Whereas. The. said Board of Sunervisors is of
the opinion that the Board of Health is com
posed of men who are ( not competent to rec
ognize bubonic plague, and have, failed to es
tablish their assertions that the said plague
exists in this community, although they have
had every opportunity to prove the truth of
their assertion both in court and out of it, and
instead of welcoming: the assistance and sup
port of the medical profession in a matter
of such grave Import to this community, have
conducted their alleged examinations In the
strictest secrecy, and by their acts proved that
they feared the scrutiny of medical men of
repute who are not looking for political fa
vors; and
Whereas. The said Board of Health, in
quarantining twelve blocks in the center of this
city, failed and neglected to Isolate the prem
ises wherein plague cases were alleged to have
been discovered, thereby affording' no protec
tion whatsoever to the residents of said dis
trict and by the general quarantine making it
impossible for the residents to protect them
selves: and
Whereas, The quarantine recently estab
lished by the Board of Health was a violation
of the rights and privieges of the people of the
Chinese race, for the reason that' It. was Im
posed upon the Chinese race only; and
A sensation was created toward the
close of yesterday's meeting of the Board
of Supervisors by McCarthy, who pre
sented a resolution calling for the resigna
tion of the members of the Board of
Health. The resolution briefly reviews the
flagrant attempt of the health officials to
fasten an epidemic of plague upon this
city. It contains a scathing denunciation
of the peculiar methods employed by them
and is in full as follows:
ASKED TO REMOVE
THE HEALTH BOARD
from going on the steamer to Eureka last
Saturday, because he had no health cer
tificate.
"I will give you one," said Judge Mor
row, and there was a general laugh.
The court then adjourned and a curious
crowd collected in the halls to watch the
crestfallen Kinyoun leave the courtroom.
He had lost entirely his air of superiority.
United States District Attorney Coombs
had prepared an answer to submit to the
court on behalf of Klnyoun, but, owing to
the sudden withdrawal of the quarantine,
he considered it best to ask the court for
more time in which to look into the mat
ter. The principal point made In the an
swer as prepared was that Kinyoun had
not violated the injunction. In that he had
not required health certificates of travel
ers who did not intend to go beyond the
State borders, although Klnyoun admits
sending the order to the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Mr. Coombs was not officially asked to
advise Kinyoun until 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. In speaking of the case he
said:
"I may now say frankly that I advised
Kinyoun on last Friday not to establish
the State quarantine, because it would bo
in disobedience of the orders of the court.
"The Federal ofllcern hare been
Instructed to consult me. I whull ad

This should be Investigated. It does
not appear to me that proper means
have been employed to prevent epi
demic, yet the disease has refused to
assert Itself as epidemic.
'â¢The conclusion of the pnblic
mind must be that the disease has
not prevailed here.
"The order of the court permits
the application of sanitary meas
ures In the bouses where suspected
cases have arisen. The proper pro
cedure would be to direct attention
to those cases and to those houses."

PRESIDENT McKINLEY ANSWERS APPEAL OF
STATE AND RAISES KINYOUN QUARANTINE
The Nation's Executive De
clares His Conviction After
investigation That the
Plague Is Not in Califor
nia and Never Has Been.
Quarantine Officer, ReMed,
Discredited and Repe
ated, P.eads With United
States Circuit Judge Mor
row for Mercy.
THE President of the United States,
acting at the most earnest solicita
tion of a committee from the Cali
fornia delegation to the Republican
National Convention, has saved the State
from further outrage at the hands of Dr.
J. J. Kinyoun, the arrogant. Irresponsible,
power-blinded quarantine officer stationed
at this port. President McKinley has
done all in his power to avert the calam
ity which was rushing upon the State
through the outrage of Quarantine per
petrated by the underling of the Treas
ury Department.
More than that, the President of the
United States has declared that after thor
ough investigation and a consideration of
complete reports from California he is
convinced that there is no plague in the
State and never has been. This welcome
decision, which not only means incalcu
lable benefit to California but heralds to
all sister States that there Is absolutely
no need to be a 1 armed by the exaggerated
and unwarranted reports of a malicious
Quarantine apent. was made yesterday by
the President to the delegation headed by
John D. Spreckels.
The members' of the delegation present
ed the facts of the Eituation as all Call
fornians know them. Attention was di
rected to the Immeasurable harm' which
was being done by falsehood and malicious
misrepresentation, and when the Presi
dent had heard these facts he announced
his decision raising- the Quarantine and
clearing- from California as far as he
could the stain placed upon it by an ar
rogant and ambitious agent
This splendid victory was not the only
Incident of grave Importance during the
day. Dr. Kinyoun was taken before the
bar of the United States Circuit Court and
asked by Judge Morrow if he had any
reason to give why he should not be pun
ished for his flagrant contempt of the
court. Judpe Morrow was severe and left
no do'jbt in the mind of the derelict officer
that he will be severely punished If he
cannot clear himself of offense.
Kinyoun's arrogance had vanished In
thin air. Rebuked, discredited and re
puft&ted by his official superiors, stand
ing without support from any source, he
pleaded mercy on the score of ignorance.
His superiors had forced him to close his
outrageous bureau at the ferry, to with
draw his inspectors at the State lines and
to permit the people of the State to
travel ;is they please. The shamefaced
official whose lust for the exercise of
unauthorized power had reacted in a ser
ious charge against himself pleaded that
he was ready to obey the court In every
con:iriand. He was told that pleading
will not save him from punishment if he
has been guilty.
Quick to te complacent after being dis
credited. Kinyoun found no delay In seek
ing to repudiate the scandal against Wat
sonville which had emanated from his
office. He announced officially that the
little town is in a condition of perfect
health. He has now fortunately been re
duced to comparative harmlessness and
may return to his Angel Island menagerie
to take consolation with his guinea pigs,
mor.keys and rats.
The people of San Francisco are still
in a state of intense indignation over the
efforts of Irresponsible officials to bring
calamity upon them. This Indignation,
found expression yesterday in a resolu
tion Introduced at the meeting- of the
Board of Supervisors and demanding that
Mayor Phelan remove the local Board of
Health as an irresponsible, incompetent
body, dangerous to the city. This Board
of Health is the official creature of Mayor
Phelan and the Mayor has been proud to
the po'.nt of boasting that he Is respon
sible for the board's action. He is re
sponsible therefore for those actions
which made Kinyoun possible and then,
dangerous.
CALIFORNIA SAVED
BY THE PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON*. June IS.â Early this
rnorning John D. Spreckels announced
that he had received a dispatch from
Secretary of State Hay in response to the
one sent by him yesterday that the Sec
retary and President McKinley would
meet the-commlttee of the California del
egation on their arrival. The members
of the delegation chosen, namely, Spreck
cls, Rideout. Pardee. Spear. Cone. Van
Fleet. Polxotto. Rowell and Robblns, left
Philadelphia for Washington on the early
morning train.
Immediately after the arrival the com
mittee proceeded to the oflice of the Sec
retary of State, where they were re
cei%-od by Secretary Hay. The Secretary
was very much interested and concerned
about the matter and listened attentively
to the statement of the conditions by
Messrs. Spreckels. Rowell, Van Fleet,
Hideout, Spear and others. Mr. Spreek
r!s read the various telegrams received
br him and by Mr. Knight from the chair
man of the California State Central Com
mittee. Colonel George Stone and others.
Secretary Hay seemed intimately in
formed of the Eituation and said the Na
tional Government was somewhat embar
rassed in the matter by the illness of
Secretary of the Treasury Gage but
President McKinley had become much in.
urested in the matter and would take it
up immediately, as the entire Federal
Govâ¢nt recognized the necessity of
prompt action.
The representatives Immediately
proceeded to the White House,
where they were accorded a most
cordial reception by President Me-
Klnlry. The President expressed
deep concern nbout the matter, and
stated that quarantine matters cave
tbe Cover ciit considerable trou
ble. Mr. vprpokeln went over the
situation and the President nald that
the statements of the delegation
were in entire harmony with all
(hat he had bern able to learn upon
the subject.
The President stated that he had
been unable to find any evidence in
the various reports and statements
made to htm or the departiuents that
would warrant the conclusion that
there exists, or ever existed, any
plasue in San Francisco. The Presi
dent was niOMt pleased to learn from
the gentlemen personally that his
conclusions were supported.
lie also expressed himself as hnv-
Injr the utmost .confidence In the
Judicinent of JudKÂ« Morrow. After
uÂ«'liiu ov*r the matter. President
McKinley wive as his conclusion that
the quarantine wan entirely unwar
ranted and would be immediately
revoked, and ordered Instructions to
be at once dispatched to that effect.
Th* committee on their own behalf pnn
in behalf of the citizens of the State of
California cordlnally thanked the Presi
dent for his prompt and effective action.
The President informally chatted over
other matters with the gentlemen and
expressed a hearty desire to be able to
visit California. The committee returned
to Philadelphia on the evening train.
KINYOUN BEGS FOR
MERCY IN COURT
Dr. J. J. Kinyoun, the Federal quaran
tine officer, whose insolent and dangerous
irresponsibility has placed the Interests
of California In jeopardy, will not soon
forget his experience yesterday before
United States Circuit Judge Morrow. The
arrogant bearing of Dr. Kinyoun had van
ished. He stood before the Judge in a
courtroom crowded to the doors as an of
fensive, incompetent, injudicious meddler,
whose orders had been revoked by his
superiors at Washington. His brief au
thority has gone and he stood under the
scrutiny of the court on an accusation of
contempt.
He heard the scathing denunciation of
the Judge and listened to the judgment
that if he has by his wild, arbitrary ac
tions committed a contempt he shall be
punished by the court whose decrees he
Is accused of ignoring with the same in
solence as he has in malice and vlndlct
lveness ridden rough shod over the inter
ests of the people of the State. And as
Dr. Kinyoun listened he probably reflect
ed that contempt of a Federal court Is a
very serious matter, punishable by fine
and imprisonment which no appeal can
revoke. â¢ 'Â¦â¢. -;: 'â¢Â¦â¢>
He pleaded, through his attorney, that
he had not knowingly committed a con
tempt and he received the ominous Infor
mation that his plea of ignorance will
avail him nothing. Called to accounting
for an unwarranted outrage he begged
that he be forgiven on the score of in-
this order to show cause. I desire
to stnte that no agreement of coun
sel ep.n remove this case from the
calendar. It .must remain here to
be disposed of, and the defendant
must answer whether or not he has
disobeyed the order of this court,
and if he has done so he must be
punished.
Judge Maguire said that there was no
Intention on the part of himself or his
associates to ask for a dismissal.
Judffe Morrowâ Xo agreement of
that kind would be recognised by
the court. The continuance will be
recognized that contemplates a dis
position of the matter until such
time as it would be supposed the
court would overlook the offense.
The courj will exercise its power
without reference to cny RUKgestlon
on the part of counsel. The court
lias taken certain steps with respect
to the matters Involved in this case,
such as Injunction, etc. If, at any
tiiue It is desirable that there should

.Capitalists must have a good deal of confidence in
the invention to have provided money for construct
ing so large a ship. It is now about to be tested
and there is naturally a good deal of curiosity in the
To the general public the Zeppelin airship will be
more interesting than the big balloon. For its con
struction there was erected on Lake Constance a float
ing plant 450 feet long and 65 "feet high and the work
has been carried on with considerable secrecy. A re
cent description of the airship says it is 400 feet long
with a diameter of 58 feet. The exterior is aluminum
and the power is to be furnished by two sixteen-horse
power motors. It is stated that as a result of its 11,300
square-yard gas supply Count von Zeppelin's inven
tion possesses a carrying capacity of a corresponding
measurement. According, to the calculations of the
builder. Engineer Kubler, the entire weight of the
ship, including the crew, Idoes not exceed ten tons,
notwithstanding in length it measures the size of an
ordinary ocean greyhound. Included in this figure is
a water ballast of one to one and a half tons.
It is stated that if a balloon can be kept at a high
altitude for a considerable period of time the benefits
to science are likely to be large. Up to this time it
has never been possible to obtain continuous records
at very high altitudes of diurnal variations in tempera
ture, pressure and wind, and data relating to such facts
are desired by meteorologists. Captive balloons have
been found serviceable only at low altitudes and kite3
have never been kept in the air more than two days,
nor can they be kept that long at a uniform altitude.
So the big balloon is expected to prepare the way for
a considerable advance not only in aeronautics, but in
meteorology.
The balloon experiment is intended solely for the
purpose of determining how long a balloon may be
kept afloat. It is to contain no less than 300,000 cubic
feet of gas and will be therefore about twice the size
of the banoon in which Andre undertook to reach
the north pole. It is to carry five aeronauts and the
promoters expect it to maintain itself in midair for
ar least a week and possibly for ten days. At any rate
the aeronauts will not return to earth until the loss of
gas renders the balloon no longer buoyant.
WHILE we are making ready for the Presi
dential election, and the French are giving an
undivided attention to their exposition, the
German* are preparing for two important experiments
in aerial traveling. One of these is to be made with
the largest balloon ever constructed and the other
with an airship Count Zeppelin of the German army
has been constructing on Lake Constance, and \v*hich
is now said to be about ready for tile trial trip.

a creed every student of the Biole must
nave. No man who loves his Bible and
studies it but will make progress In the

CALirOBNlANS IN NEW YOBK.
It is said that the harbor qÂ£ San Francisco will soon
be the home port for the entire sailing fleet of the
United States. What a splendid opportunity this will
be for another quarantine officer, drunk upon au
thority, to strike a blow at the Union as well as at
California.
During the last few days the Governor has given
evidences of a wisdom that is as refreshing as it is un
expected in conjunction with theoutrageof the plague
scare. His Excellency, with an almost inexplicable
understanding of himself, declines to say anything.
The suggestion opens up a new view of the prob
lem of dealing with trusts. The struggle against such
combines will force the public into larger and larger
schemes of co-operation, and there is no telling tr>
what extenU the. stress of the struggle will force mu
nicipalities to undertake the task of providing for the
needs of' their people. -
The advocates of the city ice plant are not so
cialists. So conservative a paper as the American
indorses the scheme and gives it cordial support. It
argues that the proposed plant should be of suffi
cient magnitude to meet all the local demand. It
says: "A municipal ice plant designed merely to
supply the needs of the city government and the va
rious charitable institutions in the city wilL necessi
tate an expenditure wholly out of keeping with the
benefits that will be derived. The City Council should
provide a sum sufficient to guarantee the release of
the entire city from the grasp of this greedy monop
oly. By increasing the amount of the; proposed ap
propriation to $100,000 or $250,000 the Committee on
Police and Jail will evidence a proper conception of
the importance of the enterprise. Such a sum will
require but a small increase in the. tax rate, and it
will insure municipal competition with the ice trust
of such a nature as will virtually drive the heartless
and extortionate corporation from Baltimore."
At the present time the trust holds in its grip the
ice supply of New York, Atlantic City, Philadelphia
and Baltimore. The fight in New York may probably
break the power of the trust in that city, but that will
not help the others. In fact, it is feared that if beaten
in New \ r ork the trust managers will endeavor to
make up for what they lose there by tightening the
cinch on the other cities. By reason of that fear a
movement has been started both in Baltimore and in
Philadelphia to beat the trust, and in Baltimore it has
taken the form of a proposal to establish a municipal
ice plant. Such a movement is something of a nov
elty in the way of municipal enterprise, but ice in the
East is a public need, and the argument is that it
should be supplied by the municipality.
THE ICE TRUST IN THE EAST.
WHILE the exposure of the connection of
prominent Tammany politicians with the ice
trust has had the effect of reducing Tammany
to such a condition of depression that David Bennett
Hill obtained an easy victory over Croker at the
Democratic State Convention on everything except
the indorsement of Bryan, and caused a decline in the
price of the stock in the market, it has accomplished
little in the way of breaking up the trust itself or
causing a reduction in the price charged to con
sumers who' buy in small quantities. Moreover, the
evil effect of the trust is felt not in New York only,
but elsewhere, and in some cities the situation appears
even worse than in New York itself.
The Kinyoun who pleaded with Judge Morrow for
mercy is the same Kinyoun who attempted to ruin
California. There is somewhere a legal axiom that
the punishment ought to fit the crime.
There is another feature of the situation not to be
overlooked. Ever since the Oregon election showed
that Bryan has less strength on the Pacific Coast than
he had in 1896, the Democratic managers have been
working hard to devise some means of carrying New
York. Even the New York Journal, which the
Democratic convention at Sacramento accredited as
Bryan's organ, has conceded that without the vote of
New York Bryan cannot be elected. The Em
pire State is therefore to be the battleground of the
year, but with the nomination of Roosevelt on the
Republican ticket there can be no doubt as to the re
sult. If New York was ever in doubt on the ques
tion of sound money against free silver, it will be so
no longer now that her favorite son is a candidate for
the Vice Presidency. McKinley and Roosevelt will
carry the country as surely as they carry the conven
tion. -:\ "â¢Â¦'.
Nor will his name be potent among the ardent only.
Roosevelt is a man of fine scholarship and a well
ripened culture. He has served faithfully in many
offices of civil life and in each has made his personal
influence felt in the direction of good government
and wise statesmanship. From his youth his career
has been steadily upward, and In the New York
Legislature, on the Police Commission, as Assistant
Secretary of the Navy, in the army and in the office of
Governor of New York he has proven himself fitted
to the performance of the highest duties of statecraft.
He will be supported therefore by conservative men
for the reason that should any unfortunate contin
gency deprive the republic of the services of McKin
ley during the coming four years Roosevelt would be
a worthy successor to the Presidency.
From everj- point of view the nomination will be
seen to be fortunate and appropriate. Roosevelt be
longs not to a class, but to the whole people; not
to a State, but to the nation. By birth and by resi
dence he is of the East, but in early life he came West
jnd identified himself with Western interests, just ai
during the war with Spain he raised his famous regi
ment of Rough Riders in the West and by .distin
guished service identified himself with Western valor
on the battlefield. His name will strengthen the
ticket not only in New York and New England, but
all over the glorious cewboy country, from Montana
to Texas, and the ardent youth of the land will be at
tracted by it from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
The movement which has brought Roosevelt, with
out solicitation on his part, to the nomination for the
second highest office in the republic, was not started
by a clique, engineered by bosses, nor pushed by a
faction. The forces behind it are the same as those
which four years ago assured the nomination ot Mc-
Kinley and make certain his renomination now. They
are forces that arise from the people themselves; they
arc the outcome of the demand for the nomination of
one whose past career has made him the logical can
didate of the office. At this juncture the country at
large recognizes that the nomination of Roosevelt
for the Vice Presidency will mean the right man at
the right time for the right place.
ALL reports from Philadelphia tend to the con
clusion that Governor Roosevelt of New York
will be given the nomination ior Vice Presi
dent on the Republican ticket, and that he will accept
it. He would prefer a renomination for Governor,
but will not permit his individual preference to lead
him to decline the high honor the party desires to
bestow upon him. His loyalty to Republicanism is
superior to his personal ambitions and it is therefore
fciriy well assured that the winning ticket will be Mc-
Kinley and Roosevelt on a platform of prosperity and
victory.

RENO MARRIAGES AND
THE LAW IN THE CASE
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for the opinions published In this colÂ«
umn, but presents them for whatever value they may have as communica
tions of general Interest. Â» â¢ . .
Editor of The Call â I see by yotir columns that some lawyers have expressed
the opinion that Judge Belcher's decision as to the validity of a marriage In an
other State between residents of California who have been divorced within a
year, will be reversed by the Supreme Court. As it Is important to public morals
that Ignorant people should not be deluded Into Illegal marriages, I venture to
make some suggestions on the subject.
While it is true, as a general rule, that a marriage, valid by the law of the
State where it is contracted, is valid everywhere, even though the parties are
not residents of that State, that rule has at least one well recognized exception.
The capacity of a person to marry Is determined by the law of the State where
he resides; and the marriage in another State of one who. by the law of his own
State, Is incapable of marriage, Is void, at least in his own State. This rule ap
plies to a statutory incapacity after divorce, unless that incapacity is penal.
The only question, then, is, whether our statute forbidding the marriage of a
divorced person within one year after the decree. Is penal.
Under the law as it stood when that statute was passed, an appeal might be
taken from a decree of divorce at any time within one year. It has always been
the law of this State that no judgment or decree is final until the expiration of
the time allowed for appeal. It followed that. If the divorced person should
marry within that time, and afterward an appeal should be taken and the de
cree reversed, the marriage would be void. To prevent that shocking state of
affairs this act was passed declaring such marriages "illegal and void from the
beginning." The effect of that statute Is therefore merely to declare that a
decree of divorce is not effective for any purpose until the expiration of a year.
Such a statute is, of course, not penal. Every State has the absolute right to de
clare how and on what terms It will grant a divorce; and no such decree can
have any more force in another State than it has in the State where it was. ren
dered. It follows that such a marriage will be void everywhere, and that a Cal
ifornia court must so hold.
Since that act was passed the time for taking an appeal has been shortened
to six months. For certain legal reasons with which I shall not now burden you.
I think that that fact cannot change the effect of the statute In question. But,
even if it did, such a marriage entered into within six months would certainly
be void.
There are other reasons why I think that Judge Belcher's decision will be
affirmed; but the one I have stated is agreed to by all the courts, and I believe
it is indisputable. In the Interest of public morals every one ought to hope that
that decision will stand. It would be a shameful condition of things If thl3 State
should be held incapable of passing an effective statute against such scanda
lous marriages, and that her own citizens should be able to defy her laws and
flaunt their shame in the faces of those who obey them.
Until the question is decided by the Supreme Court, r should advise all per
sons of self-respect to refrain from contracting a marriage which may. and I
believe will, turn out to be void; in which event the other party will be at liberty
to repudiate it, with consequences too dreadful to be Ignored.

RUSSIAâ "I'd leave my happy home for you."
CHORUS, FROM BEHIND THE WALLâ "Boo Hoo-oo-o-o-"
â Pittstmrs Dispatch.
Such is the record of the contrasted eras. Mc-
Kinley is no longer the advance agent- of prosperity,
for prosperity has come. In this campaign he stands
for the continuance of the existing order of things,
and surely there can be no considerable number of in
telligent men, not under the domination of an intense
partisanship, who will vote for. a change â and such a
change as Bryanism would bring.
As soon as McKinley was elected the situation be
gan to change. A new prosperity dawned upon the
people and rapidly brightened. As Senator Gallinger
points out, while Congress in extra session was pre
paring to revise the tariff and re-establish protection,
a great tide of money began to flow into the banks.
On September 30, 1892, individual deposits in the
banks of the country stood at a total of $1,765,422,983.
In October, 1893, with "tariff reform" impending,
they had fallen to $1,451,124^320. In December, 1897,
these deposits had gone up again to $1,919,680,252 â
reflecting the increased confidence and improved
earning capacity of the American people. The busi
ness of the New York Clearing-house advanced from
$2,589,348,832 in January, 1897, to $5,690,747,778 in
January, 1899.
The cause of the withdrawal of these vast sums of
money from the banks was the collapse of American
industry, the lack of work and wages, the fall of
prices^and the disaster that overspread the country as
a result of the overthrow of the protective system. It
was not the manufacturers only that suffered. All"
classes felt the burden of the bad times and none more
heavily than farmers who had been promised so much
of prosperity when relieved from the weight of tariff
taxation. Moreover "tariff for revenue" did not yield
even a revenue. The treasury of. the nation suffered
as well as that of individuals and had to borrow
money to meet current expenses. /
In the course of his argument Senator Gallinger
shows that in 1893, the year of the second inaugura
tion of President Cleveland, $34,518,091 was withdrawn
from the savings banks of New York State in excess
of the deposits. Business failures, which for the first
three months of 1892 had been 3207 in number, with
total liabilities of $35,861,749, rose to 3969 and $49,
085,088 in the first three months of 1894 and to 4512
and $62,513,826 in the first three months of 1896.
From May 4 to October 3, 1893, the American people
drew $378,000,000 from the national banks.
WHILE the tariff is not to have much considera
tion given it on the stump during the coming
campaign, it is nevertheless worth while for
voters to bear in mind the disaster that fell upon
the country when the sound policy of protection was
set aside in favor of an experiment with free trade. It is
therefore gratifying that? Senator' Gallinger of New
Hampshire has taken occasion to compile an elaborate
array of figures showing the striking contrast between
the conditions or the country during the two eras.
Once more the people have to. choose whether the
Government shall be in the hands of statesmen de
voted to policies whose value has been proven by ex
perience, or intrusted. to men whose opinions on all
governmental questions whether of tariff or of finance
are of the most visionary character.

If the Board of Education were as slow to pay
its political debts as it is eager to enjoinschool teach
ers to meet their obligations, the danger of scandal
in the department would be very much less than it is.
outcome. It would astonish Paris if the greatest
marvel of her exposition should prove to be a visit
from a German delegation coming down from the
clouds in an airship of the proportions described!
Beyond this we should scrupulously avoid going.
Eeyond this we have no right to go, and right should
be the limitation upon national as well as upon per
sonal action.
For these reasons it may well be that our military
presence there in the midst of this profound disturb
ance may not only prevent the partition of China, but
may secure for us the lasting friendship of that em
pire, which will be profitably reflected in our com
merce.
Our own interests and safety, our peculiar position
in the world as a republic, with commercial interests
to care for and a policy of justice to maintain toward
the rest of the nations, require that we should let it
be plainly known at the outset that not only have we
no territorial aggrandizement in view, but that we
will not support any other country in the partition of
China. This country believes that the best interests
of civilization require that China shall remain intact
and that her polity shall be undisturbed. We want
peace there, orderly government after the system
familiar to the people and only such growth of West
ern arts and appearance of new wants as may be
ratural. There is a belief abroad that if England and
the United States stand for the integrity of the
Chinese empire it will not be disturbed. While there
is a perfectly justifiable flinching from any agreement
with a foreign power in the nature of an alliance, it
must be admitted that such an understanding and
joint action with Great Britain will not affront Amer
ican feeling, but will conform to the wishes of our
people.
China is the only country in Asia that promises
any significant results in the way of foreign trade.
This is because the Chinese are the only Asiatics that
are industrious. They work and they have that com
mercial ambition which seeks to produce a surplus
for foreign trade. The first problem with them is the
supply of foodstuffs. The vast population is almost at
the limit of the domestic food supply. Russia is about
to develop the last great wheat-growing area left on
the planet. Her fields in Southern Siberia are about
to pour a wheat supply into the world's markets of a
volume that cannot be computed. She will be our
competitor in China in the bread supply. She is no
doubt the leader in the desire to eliminate that Gov
ernment, cane up the country and Russianjze the
greater part of it.
Aside from any view of the abstract justice of such
a policy, it is opposed to our commercial interests.
It is to be regretted that the United States is at all
compelled to take any part in the invasion that is now
going on. But our participation seemed inevitable
and as it is unavoidable there should be from the be
ginning a clear understanding of what it means. This
is necessary to the end that the other powers may be
under no illusion as to our purpose and that China
may be well assured as to o\ir purpose.
The predatory nations are all too ready to make the
situation a pretext for getting a permanent military
foothold in the interior of China, preparatory to carv
ing up that empire and taking European jurisdiction
of the slices. The carvers will quarrel among them
selves over the choice cuts.
In China we have the religious complication in
acute form and the riots have caused attacks on the
missionary compounds and the murder of Christians,
foreign and native.
WHILE there is no doubt that the invasion of
China by foreign troops has inflated the anti
foreign agitation in that country, it may lead
to results beneficial to China and the world. Anti-for
eign agitations are by no means peculiar to China.
We have had them in very violent form in this coun
try, grievously complicated with religious prejudice.
There have been riots in France of which Italian la
borers were the victims and feuds between" Slavs and
Germans have been common in Austria.

gramme has been arranged. The contributors^ â Rev. Edward Everett
Hale. D. D.; Thomas Wentworth Higginson, William J. Rolfe, Litt.
D.; Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Harriet Prescott Spofford and Professor
Lewis E. Gates â have been asked to talk simply "out of the fullness of
their hearts." Their names are a guaranty of the delightful treat they
are certain to provide for Home Study Circle readers.

SAN JOSE. June IS.â The California
Cured Fruit Association Is now a reality
and It will handle 80 per cent of. the prune
crop of the State the coming year. In
the maintenance of prices and taking the
dried fult product out of the hands of
speculators It will be aided by the Pack
ers' Association, which Includes nearly all
the large packers of the State. This de
termination to proceed with the Cured
Fruit Association was reached this after
noon after an all day and evening session
of the board of directors with the pack
ers. For the past few days things have
looked blue for the prune men, 90 per cent
of the acreage of the State not having
been signed.
The directors of the association state
this evening that SO per cent of the acre
age of the State* has oeen signed and over
90 per cent of the prune crop of Santa
Clara Valley. With these amounts they
believe they can maintain the association.
â¢ The work of practical organization will
now be rushed so as to handle this year a
crop. Canvassers will be put out and it
is believed many more growers will join.
The year's prune crop will be an unus
ually large one and the growers realize
that without organization prices would
fall and they would be powerless in the
hands of speculators.
The meeting of growers to-day was the
most enthusiastic ever held in Santa Clara
County. Over 1000 persons were in at
tendance. C. D. Blaney presided as chair
man.
The enthusiasm was unbounded and
ended in one thousand growers parading
the streets with a brass band and carry
ing a transparency reading: "The Prune
Combine Must Go On." In this manner
the meeting waited upon the meeting of
the Cured Fruit Association directors and
the Packers' Association In the Board of
Trade rooms and urged the parties to con
tinue the fruit association.
To-day was the time set for the di
rectors to determine whether the associa
tion had secured control of a large enough
percentage of the prune acreage to war
rant them to continue.
Speeches were made at the meeting by
C. \V. Childs, Judge Archer. Rev. J. W.
Dlnsmore, J. D. Rad^ford and others.
They all advocated organization as 'the
only salvation for the prune men. It was
stated the full 90 per centof the prune
acreage sought had not been signed with
the association, but all were in favor of
the association going ahead and hand
iinjr what fruit it controlled. They
pledged their hearty support.
A committee who had been sent to see
L. Lion & Sons in regard to seeing if
they would sign their 200 acres with the
association, reported that Mr. Lion had
sold his prunes to A. C. Kuhn & Co., the
only packing firm out of the association
of packers.
The committee on resolutions reported
as follows:
At a mass meeting of fruit growers, bankers,
merchants and other business men held this
day, June 18, the following resolution was
adopted with sreat unanimity and enthusiasm:
"It Is our very decided Judgment that the di
rectors of the California Cured Fruit Associa
tion should now proceed to carry Into effect the
purpose of the orpanlzatlnn. It is our earnest
desire that they should do bo. and we pledge
them our most hearty confidence, In the under
taking, and further we believe that the emer
gencies of the case require that they go for
ward. -
This was adopted unanimously and the
following committee was N named to pre
sent It to the directors: C. D." Blaney,
chairman; E. T. Pettitt. F. M. Riphter,
K. F. lx>rd. C. W. Childs. Dr. J. XV. Dlns
more, Judge Hurlbert and J. TV. Dunn.
Then the matter of the growers escort
ing the committee came up and was car
ried with a hurrah. In a few minutes
money was raised for the expense. With
Colonel Whltton as grand marshal they
marched to the Board of Trade rooms.
The committee presonted their resolutions
and Vice President Henry addressed them.
The meeting severely denounced the ac
tion of Dr. Kinyoun in placing the quar
antine on the State, and a committee was
appointed to prepare resolutions along
those lines.

There are in the Island fifty-seven towns
having a population of 1000 or more, the
total urban population under this defini
tion numbering 203,792. or 21.4 per cent of
the total.
WASHINGTON. June 18. â Inspector
General J. P. Sanger, Director of the Cen
fU s of Porto Rico, has Issued bulletin No.
1, giving itemized statements of the popu
lation of the island according to the cen
sus taken October 16 last. The popula
tion of the island as shown by that cen
sus was S)53,243, about nine-tenths of. the
population of the State of Maryland in
lSlrJ. From 1SG0 to 1877 the percentage of
increase in Porto Rico was 14.24; from 1S77
to 3&>7 it was 9.14 per cent, and from ISa*
to 1SD3 was 1G.20 per cent.
The present rate of increase Is about the
Fame as that of Ohio, Tennessee or the
Carolinas between the decade of l&iO and
1&"). Among the pixty-nine municipal dis
tricts Into which the departments are di
vided, seven decreased in population be
tween 1SS7 and 1SS3. As all of them lie on
the coast, the bulletin says, the coast dis
tricts as a whole may have grown more
slowly than the interior of the Inland.
The area of the island, including: the ad
jacent and dependent islands of Vieques.
Cult-bra, Mona and Muertos measured in,
connected with the census, is 3G!)6 square
miles, but owing to the imperfect surveys
in which mans of Porto Kico are based
there must be considerable and indeter
minate margin of possible error In any
fuch measurement. The island is about
three times the size of Long Island. There
are 264 persons to the square mile, the
density of the population being about the
same as in Massachusetts, twice that in
New York and thrice that in Ohio. It Is
more than seven times that of Cuba. The
least settled district has Jlfty-eiRht per
sons to the square mile. The people of
the lflar.d are in the main a rural com
munity. San Juan, with 32.04S. and Ponce.

Special Dirpatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON*. Juno 1?.â J. iJamb Doty.
Consul of the United States at Tahiti, has
reported to the State Department regard
ing a.n American steamship line between
Tahiti and San Francisco as follows:
"During the extraordinary session of the
General Council cf this colony, which was
convened yesterday for the purpose, a con
tract was awarded to the Oceanic Steam-
Fhip Company of San Francisco for the
establishment ot a steamship line between
Tahiti and San Francisco for the trans
portation of mails, passengers ar.d freight,
ill- essential features of the contract are
â¢ rollow:
'l-'or the annual sum of iy>.0'J0 franc*
'J30A f W in United grates goldi to be paid by
\he Tahiti Government, and exemption
from jÂ«ort charges, the Oceanii Steam
ship Company is to operate an American
steamship oi about 8000 tons gross regis
ter, performing eleven round trips per an
num at an average speed of not less than
Xi\~ knots. The contract is awarded for
a period of live years frr.m the hrst voy-
Btfe. which is to be made not later than
November l. 1900. ar.d earlier if possible.
â¢"Ii is the purpos-e or this company io
use a tirst-class passenger steamship and
to make the service attractive in all par
ticulars; and ii is anticipated that this
will become a favorile route of travel
when the charm of the climate ar.d
Boenery of Tahiti be ome known.
"The Inauguration of this line will give
great impetus to I'r.i'.ed Stales tradf* with
Tahiti, aiiti. in general. Kith other islands
of EasK-rr, Polynesia. The Pacific coast
of the United States will be particularly
benefited, as perishable goodsâ such as
fruits, vegetables and meatsâ which now
are received exclusively from New Zea
land, will then cnu from San Francisco.
"For over thirty-four years a regular
monthly Failing vessel service has been
maintained befveer. Tahiti and San Fran
cisco. This direct means of communica
tion developed a trade, insignificant at
lirst. but amounting some ten years ago to
over B0 per cent cf the entire business of
this colony. Since then the proportion of
trade has remained about the same, not
withstanding the establishment of the
Steam Hr.e to New Zealand and the fact
that the sailing vessels are entirely inade
quate as a means of transportation be
tween this port and San Francisco.
"It may he predicted that if the Oceanic
Steamship Company continue* in this busi
ness for five years' the trade between the
United States and Tahiti will rot only ex
perience a great extension, but that the
proportion of value will increase from 50
to 75 per cent.
"The Union Steamship Company (Brit
ish i df New Zealand, which now operatfg
a steamer between Tahiti and Auckland,
has for Mime time past desired to extend
its service through to San Francisco, and,
indeed, at this moment it has a proposi
tion before the local Government offering
to perform the service for an annual sub-

Machadodorp, sent a dispatch to Com
mandant Louis Botha on June 23, suggest

bravery of the burghers. It was pointed
out that the surrender would be without
dishonor to the burghers and would pre
vent much suffering. General Botha ask

to confer and consider. Lord Roberts con
sented to five days. Finally Botha de
clined to accept the proposal and hos

Other advices from Machadodorp say
that ihe Boers have an abundance of

oxen, ar.d that they are preparing heavy
wagon trains for a retreat to the Lyden

have been the bearer of a verbal message
from the British authorities to President
Kruger to the effect, that if He would sur
render now he would not be sent out of
the country. Van Leeuwen was unable to
t-eÂ« Mr. Kruger, but when passing through
Machadodorp. he told State Secretary
Reitz. The latter scouted the idea of sur
render. R. J. H. Fortulnhead of the

The tortoise Is not an animal one would
naturally fix upon as likely to be afraid
of rain, but it is singularly so. Twenty-,
four hours or more before rain falls the
Galapagos tortoise makes for some con
venient shelter. On a bright, clear morn
ing when not a cloud is to be seen, the
denizens of a tortoise farm on the Afri
can coast may sometimes be seen heading
for the nearest overhanging rocks. When
tliat happens the proprietor knowd that
rain will come down during the day, and,
as a rule it comes down In torrents. The
sign never fails. â¢ This presentation, or
whatever you may call It, which exists in
many birds and beasts, may be explained
partly from the increasing weight of the
atmosphere when rain is forming, partly
by habits of living and partly from the
need of moisture, which is shared by all.
If we want to find a country where na
ture has turned things topsy-turvyâ that
is, according to our notionâ we must go
to Australia. Many things are reversed
in that country. It is summer there while
it is winter In America. Trees shed their
bark Instead of their leaves; fruit has
the stone, or kernel, outside: swans are
black: there is a species of fly that kills
and eats the spider, and a fish, called the
climbing perch, that walks deliberately
out of the water and, with the aid of Its
fins, climbs the adjacent trees after the
insects that Infest them. When to this
we add that most of the birds have no
song and the flowers no odors It Is easily
seen that it is on the other side of the
world in more senses than one.â Atlanta

Ice cream, for thpy thought I had stood
in with the landlady on this particular
occasion. 'When the remains of the last
course before cream were removed the
landlady rang the bell for the doxology.
In walked the waiter with a tray of sau
cers heaped up with white Ice cream. The
bock agent handed over the four dollars
to the blonde boarder and the refresh
ment was put out of sfght without any
remarks. The landlady, however, in clos
ing the Incident ?ai<l she hoped we all
liked the white cream, as the man who
usually delivered the hue which was her
favorite had left the wrong bucket by
mistake and she had not discovered it un
til It was too late.
"I showed no curiosity to know how I
had come to go up against the new board
er, but the book agent let It out one even-
Ing on the stoop that if he ever took to
gambling he would not bet with a man
whose brother held the cards. The blonde
boarder's brother was the deliverer of
cream to this house, and of course â -well,

BET WITH THE NEW BOASDER
The Brooklyn Man Who Was Sure
the Landlady Would Stick to
Pink Icecream.
"When I feel the gambling instinct tak
ing possession of me now," said a Brook
lyn man who lives In a private boarding
house, "I get on my wheel and go out to
Coney Island, where I am not known and
go up against anything which strikes my
Fancy. 1 don't try making a winning ofT
the new boarder any more. I'm not smart
enough for that. The last new one at
our house had a manner and look which
would have encouraged a shellworker to
pick him out as the one altogether easy
in a thousand. I had done nearly all the
boarders from time to time in some inno
cent way, and when this chap came in I
spotted him as my meat. It was Satur
day. I remarked in his hearing in my off
hand, free and easy speech, that I would
bet $2 that I could call the turn on the
kind of dessert we have put in front of
use on the morrow.
"I thought I had a cinch on naming it.
but It was such an exceedingly open-faced
wager I was a little leary that the blonde
wouldn't look at it. But he came up like
a young pig to the swill and asked me to
name the goody which the landlady would
use In hypnotizing the palates of her
boarders. I named pink Icecream. I had
been a boarder there for eight months
and never had the pink icecream business
fail to show up on the Sabbath menu. The
blonde boarder said the chances were
against him, and that he had never con
sidered himself a sport, but he would lay
me two even that it wouldn't be pink Ice
cream for the Sunday dessert. The money
was put In the hands of a book agent who
had threatened to leave the house every
Sunday when the fro*en cream with car
nation hue was landed before him. The
time came all too poon.
."The other boarders were waiting and
watching the outcome, and they all had
It in for me because I had named pink

TO BE UNITED
AT HIGH NOON
In April. 1534. JacquÂ«-s Cartier sailed
from St. Malo with instructions, to find
the passage to "Cathay." Voyaging in
the direction long familiar to Breton fish
ermen he reached Belle Isle on the north
shore of Newfoundland, the only notable
incident of the trip so far being a meet
ing in one of the harbors of Labrador
with a fishing vessel from La Rochelle.
Cartier passed southward along the west
coast of Newfoundland, crossed the Gulf
of St. Lawrence to the east coast of New
Brunswick, visited the bay of Chaleur
and the peninsula of Gaspe, and after
skirting part of Anticoste Island returned
to Franco without being aware appar
ently of the existence of the great river
across the mouth of which he had sailed.
He took with him from Gaspe two In-

Newfoundland banks to pursue their call
ing more profitably than they could at
home. To this class Jacques Cartier be
longed, and he must have been acquainted
with their geographical ideas, acquired
either by actual observation or from the
descriptions given to them by natives with
whom they came in contact. It Is alto
gether likely that he had made one or
more voyages to the trans-Atlantic fishing
grounds himself, as he had a high reputa
tion for skill and courage In navigation
and was for this very reason selected to
command the exploring expeditions. The
peninsula of Brittany is the extreme west
point of France, south of the English
Channel. Near its inner end and on Its
north shore is the seaport of St. Malo.

Its time-worn predecessors. The old fa
vorites are as welcome as ever.
Columbia.
Those who have failed to witness the
entertainment provided by Kellar, the
magician, at the Columbia Theater should
take advantage of the few performances
to be given before the close of his season
here. Last evening the lower part of the
house was not as large as the manage
ment had a right to expect, considering
the high class of entertainment, presented.
Those present enjoyed the mysterious
feats of the performer, Â¦who was liberally
applauded. He introduced quite a num
ber of new features and during the even
ing did not allow the interest to decrease.
Kellar will continue at the Columbia until
the 25th inst.. when the Henry Miller
Company will open with "Miss Hobbs,"
a comedy of the first order.
Alcazar.
"Sapho" is still a drawing- card at the
Alcazar Theater. The story of the woman
whose ambition was to have a new male
friend for every week of the year still
proves attractive and the little theater Is

this is the bcginlng of the third week.

Fischer's Concert-House.
The Fischer Concert-house bill this week
\r an especially good one. Last night a
large audience listened to the interesting
programme â there is a Fischer fad just
at presentâ and remained to the end to
hear "La Forza del Destino," the fourth
act of which represents the operatic part
of the bill. Bardaracco sings the Denza
"Fugriniti." Miss Underwood the "Pearl
of Aria," Abramoff the "Dlo Possente"
of Gounod. Polletini an aria from "Lucre
tia Borgia," and the new singer. Mme.
Mowry, an aria from "Ernani" and Luck
stone's "Delight." Every number was en
cored.
The "Wagner "Album Lear 1 and the
"Pre/luflio" of Mercadante were delight
fully given by the orchestra, which is,
however, still a little too "evident" In thÂ«
vocal numbers.
Chutes.
Olympia.
The Chutes has an excellent bill this

their cute pickaninnies, scored a great hit.
Other numbers on the bill are thoÂ«e of

Once more the "Milk White Flag" is
with i:s â that curious mixture of mud,
pasta diamonds and real brilliants. By
the ni.d I mean the flashy, meretricious
dresse* and undresses, the "rag-time" and
;>rrot-llke songs, the cold-blooded, offen
sive and in every detail detestable Joklnir
at death and the mystery of death In
R-bich the play abounds. By the paste
diamonds 1 mean the specific satire on
the rr.Hitia. which may have had some
tr-nuine force when the play was written,
before the Spanish war, but which on
account of the excellent conduct of the
n.iiitia in that war seems now feeble and
jjurposeless. By the real brilliants I mean
the ger;erfc.l satire on the vanity of men
a.i;d the liekleness of wornen, which gives
the n!ay its oniy element of real value.
For "the writing of such satire Hoyt has.
.,r had. undoubted capacity; It is a pity
he has not applied mmseif to the con
struction of two or three good plays in-
Etead of distributing his material for that
hraall number among a dozen indifferent
pieces. "Give thÂ«? people what they
v.a.nt" is understood to be his motto, and

tinue the work of exploring his posses
sions In the new world. In 1341, however,
an expedition was planned for the estab
lishment of a colony. Roberval was ap
pointed viceroy of the country, and he and
Cartier were commissioned to proceed to
gether to the St. Lawrence. For some
reason the former was not ready in time,
and Cartier made his third voyage alnne.
As the Indian chiefs had all died during
the interval to France. hÂ»3 reception wa.-t
not so friendly as before, but he never
theless went into winter quarters in a for
tified camp at Cap Rouge, some seven
miles up the river from Quebec. He first
paid another v.slt to Hochelaga. but on
finding his progress westward barred by
the Lachine rapids he abandoned all idea
of trying to penetrate further into the In
terior. In the spring of 1512 he returned
to France and Roberval arrived In the
St. Lawrence, -where he remained until the
autumn cf 1543. spending much of his time
in exploring the Saguenay and other phy
sical features of the sumiundin? country.
There Is a tradition, but no authentic rec
ord, that Cartier made a fourth voyajte
to Canada, for the purpose of brlnsrtns
back Roberval and his men. He is said to
have lived in St. Malo till 1577. In a house
the ruins of which are still pointed out
to the Inquiring visitor. A few yeara aero
a fine monument was erected to hig ttiotti
ory on the bank of the great river whost
existence he was the first to make known
to France, to Europe and to the world.
Owing mainly to the political and mili
tary troubles which darkened French his
tory during the remainder of the century,
the whole region was temporarily aban
doned to the enterprising fishermen, no
explorer of any note appearing on the
scene until a greater than Cartier. the il
lustrious Champtaln. early !n the seven
teenth century took up and carried to a
successful Issue the task of colonizing as
well as exploring "New France."

The winter spent by Cartier and h!<* men
in their fortified quarters at the mouth of
the St. Charles was long, dreary and se
vere. Scurvy, the bane of northern voy
agers in the winter season, when flesh is
almost the only available food, carried of?
many members of the company before
they learned to use an infusion of spruco
boughs as an antidote. In the spring they
abandoned one of their smaller vess>e'-Â«.
and taking with them the Huron chief
Donnaccnna and some other prominent
members of the tribe, as captives, they
sailed for France, arriving 1 at St. Ma!)
about the middle of July. 1538. On the re
turn voyage Cartier took a course to ifv?
south of Newfoundland, thus showing hiÂ»
familiarity with the geography of the re
gion about the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Th>?
country which he had discovered in the
valley of the river has ever since been
known as Canada. Though the origi:> of
the word ;s not free from obscur'ty. It
seems to be of the Huror.-Iroo.uols dialecr.
and to signify such a collection of Indian
dwellings as Cartfer found at Stadacona,
and. in a still more typical form, at Hoclv
elaga. In Cartfer's time the name was
limited to a small locality, but it was soon
applied to the whole country by those
who never knew or ceased to regard its
original meaning. Xeedlesa to say; the
discoverer claimed the country for the
King of France and set up evidences of
the claim at various points in the form
of large wooden crosses with suitable in
scriptions engraved on them.
in September delighted the French, who
dwelt with something like ecstasy on tho
grape-laden vines and the vast flocks of
wild fowl that were stirred into flight
by tile unusual appearance of the flotilla.
The Indians of Hochelaga, like those of
Stadacona, were of the Huron nation, and
they received Carrier with extravagant
demonstrations of joy. Their village was
described by him as circular in outline
ar.d surrounded by three row*, of pa)i
sldes. designed as a protection against
the hostile Iroquois. The village con
tained about fifty hrruses. each of which,
about 100 feet Ions, was divided into sev
eral compartments for the accommoda
tion of as many separate, families. These
Indians had apparently abandoned the
nomadic life ar.rt had acquired the art
nf storing up grain and preserving other
provision* fr>r future use. The fine emi
nence behind the city which now covers
the site of the Hochelaga village wa.s
named by Cartier "Mount Royal," since
abbreviated Into "Montreal."

How much of all this was known to
Jacques Cartier cannot now be deter
mined, but it seems quite probable that
he had acquired a fairly correct idea of
the extent and general character of the
Atlantic coast. Like other navigators of
the time, he was under the impression
that America was narrow arid that some
where along it would be found a passage
through to the Pacific Ocean. For more
than a quarter of a century the French
fishermen of Picardy, Normandy and Brit-
Jacques Cartier.
In order to understand the contribution
made by Jacques Cartier to our knowl
edge of this continent it Is necessary to
bear In mind what had already been dis
covered when he began his work under a
commission from Francis I of France, In
1534. Colun\bus had, under the auspices
of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, made
his first voyage in 1132, and three others
before his death, in 1506. He had landed
on one of the Bahama Islands, discovered
Cuba, Jamaica and Haiti, and sailed for
some distance up the Orinoco. John and
Sebastian Cabot, commissioned by Henry
VII of England In 1497, had reached the
continent in the vicinity of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. Cortereol. a Portuguese, had
in 1500 discovered Hudson Strait, giving
rise to the hope that the passage to India
and China, of which they were all in
search, had been found. In 1513 Balboa,
a Spanish adventurer, had crossed the
Isthmus of Panama and called the ocean
he discovered the "South Sea," In the
same year another Spaniard, Ponce de
Leon, had skirted the coast of Florida
from St. Augustine to Tampa Bay. In
1519 Magellan, a Portuguese in the service
of Spain, had passed through the strait
which still bears his name, crossed the
Pacific Ocean and established Spanish
sovereignty over the Philippine Islands,
where it remained unbroken until 1S3S.
Between 1519 and 1521 Cortez had acquired
Mexico as a Spanish possession. In 15^4
Verrazano, an Italian la the service off
France, had voyaged along the Atlantic
coast from Carolina to Nova Scotia.

Reported Sale of British Steamship
Westminster â Disabled Launch
Quarantined at Angel
Island.
Grave anxiety is felt for the safety of
the schooner Americana, now out 107 days
from Calcta Bucna for this port,, with a
cargo of nitrates. The reinsurance brok
ers p.uoted her at 10 per cent last week,
but upon the' arrival yesterday of the
Salvator Clampa, forty-six days from the
same port, the reinsurance jumped to 25
and then to 35 per cent.
The Americana is a four-mast steel
schooner and an Al vessel, but no one
can explain her long trip. From fifty to
sixty days is considered a long trip from
nitrate ports, but 107 days beats the rec
ord. It is feared bv her owners that she
got into heavy weather and foundered with
all hands. Still, there 1? a chance that
she may sh'nw up and insurance men are
cautious. On this coast the winds are
often so variable that a fore-and-aft, ves
sel has but small show to gain headway.
The Americana is stocked for a long voy
age and she will be looked for for some
weeks to come. Her owners are confident
that she will arrive safely.
Westminster Reported Sold.
It is reported the British tramp steam
ship Westminster, now under charter to
the Government as a horse transport, has
been sold to John Rosenfeld's Sons to en
page in the coastwise co'al trade. The
Westminster has been in the Government
employ for more than a year and has
earned rich dividends for her owners, and
more particularly her charterer. John
Rosenfeld's Sons, who rcchartered her to
the Government at a clear profit of sev
eral hundred dollars per day, according to
report. When she was last in this port,
about two months ago. the Westminster
was changed to a freight ship and took a
cargo of hay and grain to the Philippines.
At that time she was carefully inspected
by John Rosenfeld's Sons and it is now
understoo.1 that they have paid $175,000
for her. When she next reaches this port
she will likely be dismissed from the Gov
ernment service.
Drifted Into Quarantine. ..
William Chapman, lawyer and amateur
sailor, had an odd experience with Dr.
Kinyoun's understudies at Angel Island
last Sunday. He was out on the bay in
his gasoline launch with some friends,
when the shaft broke and the little vessel
drifted about helplessly in the bay. Late
in the afternoon the shores of Angel
Island were reached, and great was the
surprise of Mr. Chapman when a man on
shcre leveled a gun on him and told him
not to land. But there was no help for it
and the launch drifted to the shore. The
man with the gun promptly placed the
party in quarantine and it was several
hours before the members were released
and permitted to return to their homes.
It was cold cheer for a. shipwrecked party.
Crowley's Tender Heart.
Tommy Crowley, the boatman, is noted
along the water front for his good deeds.
His fast launch and his personal services
are at the command of the unfortunate.
Last Sunday he had a chance to show
what he could do. The schooner Rosa
mond sailed from the Mission-street dock,
leaving- behind a pretty little woman who
was booked for Honolulu under the name
of Miss McDonald. The pretty woman
saw the vessel tacking down the bay and
burst into tears. Crowley was notified
and went to her relief. The young woman
raid that her husband was on board and
that was enougrh for the gr>od-hearted
boatman. He steamed up and put the
lady on the schooner, where she promptly
fainted, without even saying "thanks."
Water Front Notes. ;
All forelirn->bound vessels have been de
clared free from quarantine and will here
after be granted clean bills of health.
A man who claimed to be the captain of
the British ship Lord Elgin attempted
last week to bunko John Henry of the

NEW YORK. June 18.â The stock market
fiigPFted a large amount of liquidation to-day
at what seemed slight expense of values, con
sidering the appearance of the extreme weak
ness manifested by the market at times. This
result was due to the fact that prices were
lifted In the early dealings to a level lome
v!.;.t above Saturday's close and that there
Â¦was a substantial rally In the late dealings
In coverings by the professional bears, who
had taken advantage of the softness of the
rr:arkft to put out extensive ehort lines. But
the inherent weakness of the market was none
the less evident. The buying demand through
out the day tame largely from the short ln
tpre.Â«t arid from inflde Interests with the pur
p.*Â« of supporting prices in their own stocks.
Preparation* for this had been made on an
elaborate Fcale In expectation of acute depres
sion on forelen exchanges as a result of Sat
urday's development in Chinese complications,
but the weakness in foreign markets was not
as extreme ;.s h&d beon feared, partly owing
to the fact that the alarming rumors of the
dfstruction of the foreign legations In Peking
and the death of the German Minister was
somewhat discredited this morning in specu
lative circles. Prices of American stocks ad
vanced In London before the cpenlng h*re and
London bought etocks of some companies here

titude of London gave color to recent reports
that some of the principal bear operators of
the NeÂ»\Ycrk Exchange now abroad have been
operating- on the ehort Eide of the .market.
The character of the buying was sufficiently
manifest from the duilneae Into winch the
market quickly sank when It rose to and
above Saturday's closing level. The b<?ar trad

uncover Ftcp-loes orders and they had consid

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, June 18.â Startling reports of the
extreme ' gravity of the crop situation In the
wheat growing States of North and South Da
kota and Minnesota made a wildly excited
opening In wheat. The demand for wheat,
especially from the Northwest, was far ahead
of any day this year. The commission houses
were stuffed with buying orders from all sec
tions. There was scattered selling for profits,
but tbls was readily absorbed and the ad
vance began with the ringing of the gong at
9:30. July opened ttG^gC higher at 75%c to
75?ic, and almost without a check went boom
ing up to 79*ic. Vic under the high mark last
year. The top was reached half an hour tie
fore the close and such dips as occurred on the
advance were comparatively frail. From the
pinnacle of Its strength July reacted to 7Sftc I
and closed 3Hc over Saturday at 7S?i<3"7ST4c.
The great mass of reports may be briefly sum
marized as follows: Saturday and Sunday were
the worst days of the season for the spring i
wheat crop In the Northwest; many sections of
the Northwest will not raise enough wheat for
seed; 30.000.000 bushels Is an outside possibility
for the North Dakota orop,~"'whlch last year
approximated 80,000.000 bushels. North Dakota,
South Dakota and Minnesota combined cannot
raise over 100,000,000 bushels, a decrease from
last year of 120,000.000 bushels. The entire yield,
of winter and spring wheat, notwithstanding
the "bumper" crop of Kaunas, will not be over
500.000.000 bushels, according to the estimate of
Statistician Snow. In comparison with the
spring wheat advices the winter wheat com
plaints received little attention although they
were serious enough In themselves to start
things moving. Illinois, Indiana and Missouri
reported damages from excessive rains and
Russia' was said to be suffering from drought
In the south. The market was several points
out of line In respect to cash business, and In
many instances cash wheat was resold to ad
vantage.
Corn, In spite of the wheat Curry, waa
rather sluggish early. Finally, however, tho
market grasped the coattalls of the ascending
wheat values and scored an advance of *iÂ©*Â»c
over Saturday.
Oats were somewhat more active than usual
In sympathy with wheat. July gained %@>%o.
Provisions were steady, but no attempt waa
made by the controlling Interests to unduly
stimulate the market. The trade was rather
quiet and the main business of the day was
In changing July over to September. July pork
closed unchanged and ribs gained 2%c. July
lard dosed 2!Â±c lower.

GERMAN SCHOLAR PASSES
AWAY AFTER LONG ILLNESS
This afternoon Attorney Robert Y.
H?yno, for the city of Oakland, filed with
xV.c Srprcme Court an application for a
writ of prohibition to keep Judge Hart
off the bench of Alameda County in this
ection. This petition covers many page:.
tf typewritten paper ar.d deals only with
the questions of law in the matter. It
takes the same ground as that taken by
Attorney Hayne in his arguments before
Judpe Hart, that the Sacramento Jurist
wp.b improperly summoned to the bench
and that he has no right to sit in the
Â«~ase, ar.d both a temporary and a per
petual writ of prohibition is asked for to
;>rÂ»v*Â»nt him trying the case.
The attorneys for the Contra Coeta
Water Company were evidently expecting
this move, for they had left word that
they be notified immediately if any euch
panors were filed with the Supreme Court.
Judge Hart Is sacrificing a great deal in
the interests of his duty in th:s case. He
ar.nour.ced from the bench on Saturday
that he continued as the trial judge in
thiÂ» case only because he felt that it was
fciB duty to so do and because he felt
that he* ought' to sacrifice his personal
feelings in the interests of his duty. Ho
has been requested to retire from the trial
ft the case by a lo?al motion filed by
the city of Oakland, by the personal re
quest of the counsel for the city and now
a petition to th*> Supreme Court has been
filed asking that body to prevent him
from trying the case. Vet Judpe Hart
continues to sacrifice his personal feelings
upon the altar of duty.
There are some points that are not gen
erally understood that enter into the case
very" decidedly. There 1m practically no
appeal from the decision of Judpre Hart
in ihl* matter. This is one reason why
thp attorneys for th* city do not want
to po to trifil before Judge Hart, having
orce rtc-n placed in the position of hnv-
Jrjc personally opposed his sittinp in the
case Ore ol tho great points that will
have to be passed upon in this case is
the fixing of the valuation of the plants
cf the water company upon which the
- m.- ~ m~. ~ Â»e
/!5=^ AKLAN'D. June IS.â Since Judge E.
V C Hurt of Sacramento County has
Vs-^" decided that once having been ii-
vited to come to Oakland to try the
â¢tter rate case he is cot going to retire.
* 'Â«-n thouph requested to do so by the
forney for the city, the latter has ap
j'-Hled to the Supreme Court to enforce
::= request.
Decision of the Trial Court Will Settle Finally
Most of the Important Points of the
Case at Bar.
City Council will be compelled to fix a
rate. In this matter Judge Hart's deci
sion will practically be final. \ for it has
been the rule of the Supreme Â¦ Court of
California from the very beginning to
eor.bider only matters of law. and not to
pasa upon matters of fact. As the fixing
of the valuation of the plants of the com,
pany is a matter of fact Judpe Hart's
decision in this matter will be final.
A^ain the importance of this matter
can he set-n by showing the valuation
that the water company claims for its
plants as compared with the valuation
al'.owed by the City Council in fixing the
rates. The Centra Costa Water Company
seeks by thi* suit to have the valuation
of its property fixed at JS.500.000. while
the City Council fixed the rates upon a
basis of less than $4,<XM),000 valuation.
The manner at which the Contra Costa
Water Company arrives at its valuation
is purely one of stock and bond Inflation,
without" regard to actual cost of the
works. The water company has merely
added together the value of its stock is
sue, its bond Issue, the J1.500.W0 worth of
stock issued for the purchase of the Oak
land Water Company and the value ot
the Jl .000,000 worth of bonds of the Oak
land Water Company guaranteed by them
in the absorption of the latter plant.
On the other hand, the -City Council Ig
nored completely the plant of the OaUland
Water Company, holding that they would
fix rates only upon the value of such a
plant as might be necessary to supply the
city Gf OtJiiand with water, ami thoy
fixed the valuation of that plant at S2,50Â«t,
000 less than the company claimed 'or ;t.
In these matters Judge Hart's word will
be law, and In a suit Involving Â«Â«> many
important isrues the city of Oakland, does
not wa.it to take any chances, more par
ticularly when the attorneys for the Con
tra CoÂ«ta Water Company are .to anx
ious to keep Judge Hart upon the bench.
The City Council at its meeting thr3
evening appropriated $5000 as compensa
tion for Robert Y. Hayne, special counsel
for me city in the suit of the Contra
CoPta Water Company against the city of
Oakland. The sum of $100 was placed at
the disposal of the Auditor and City At
torney to meet the immediate and ur
gent exuenses of the suit.
The City Council also provided fire pro
tection for the annexed district by appro
priating f57S0 for the purchase of horses,
harness and hose for the Fire Depart
ment. Councilman L,cmmon's ordinance
authorizing me appointment of the neces
sary men ns crews for the recently pur
chased apparatus was also passed.

FINAL EFFORT TO
GET RID OF HART
Fire broke out shortly after 2 o'clock
this morning in the two-story lodging
house at 490 Eleventh street, and before
It was extinguished three men were se
verely burned. Two of them may die as
the result of their Injuries.
The department was summoned to the
scene of the fire bj- a still alarm sent in
by some person unknown. "When the fire
men arrived they found the flames had
made rapid progress. The rumor spread
quickly that several people were asleep
In the house. Several rushed in, among
them Fireman Sweeny, who discov
ered the proprietor of the place, Mike
Coyne, groping blindly about In an up
per hall, hi3 clothing ablaze.
Sweeny grabbed Coyne and made his
way as quickly as possible to the street,
his clothes catching lire from his blazing
burden.
Edward Kelly, a carpenter, rooming at
the place, was also rescued, almost suf
focated.
The fire was extinguished in a short
time, without much damage to the
building.
Sweeny, Coyne and Kelly were hurried
to the Receiving Hospital, where a hasty
examination convinced the surgeons in
charge that the fireman and the proprie
tor of the lodging-house were so severely
blirned lhat their chance of life was slim.
The origin of the fire Is unknown.

OLYMPIC CLUB WILL
BE GREATLY IMPROVED
THE gleeful but misunderstood antics
of I a horse that wanted to shake
hands over the bar with Harry Bren
nan caused a small panic on upper
Market street yesterday afternoon. The
animal was standing hitched to a post in
front of the Emma Spreckels building,
thinking of bygone happy days, when the
sound of Brennan's voice raised in laugh
ter was wafted to his ears from the Zlnk
and Buffet by the forty-knot zephyr that
was sailing down Market street toward
the water front. The head and tail of the
equine brute went into the air simulta
neously. The horse knew that laugh, and
forgetting in the excess of his joy the so
cial gulf that now separatee them, decided
to make a long delayed call on his old
friend Harry. He did not wait to send
in his card, but with a Joyful snort broke
his tether with a jerk of his head and
made a dash for the open door of the sa
loon. . .
The sidewalk was crowded with men,
women and children, and the sudden move
of his horseshlp caused a wild stampede
for places of safety. The young man
who officiates at the cigar stand in front
of Kelly & Brennan's thought a troop of
wild horses was charging down upon him,
and made a frantic effort to escape by
climbing through the* twelve-by-flfteen
window connecting the cigar stand with
the bar. But the horse was not after
cigars nor cigar dealers. He kept right
on into the saloon until his further
progress was barred by the buggy to
which he was attached bringing up
acalnst the door frame.
Brennan was not expecting a caller just
then. He was handing out a little hot air
to a customer, and when the grinning fea
tures of his equine friend appeared in the
doorway he was too frightened to recog
nize them. His hair rose on end and he
began to yell for help. Kelly, who was In
the rear, came rushing to the front, and
the customer, who had sought a refuge in
an inner room, called back encouragingly:
"Let him come In, Harry: he vants to
blay de machine. Don't pe afralt of him."
Perceiving he was not welcome, as Bren
nan did not even ask him to have some
thing, the hor3e, with a snort of disgust,
backed out and whirling suddenly around
dashed down the middle of the sidewalk
toward Fifth street. As he turned the
buggy upset and a woman was knocked
down, but not seriously injured. Half-way
down the block the horse suddenly
swerved and dashed across* Market street
and on the oproslte sidewalk. Evidently
he was looking for another sa
loon. He took a , slide when he
Ftruck the sidewalk and skated grace
fully up against the entrance to a laundry
office. Before he could gather himself for
anothor spurt an ex-man-o' -war's man
tackled him and sat on his head while the
crowd proceeded to disentangle him from
the remains of the buggy. The festive an
imal's little flirtation resulted in no dam
age beyond wrecking the buggy.

The church board announces that Rev.

Is voluntary. Chairman C. E. Lloyd said
the pastor -would return to his former res
idence at Lincoln. Neb., either to resumw
pastoral relation? with a church there or
to take up genera! evangelical work.
For several months Rev. Mr. Smith had
been occupying the pulpit here only from
Â¦week to week. His ultimate resignation
was expected because of friction In tho
church over the refusal of the members
to accept its Investigating board's report
upon conduct of, the paator at Woodland.
William T. Gibtts and other trustees re
signed from the board and much feellns
was prevalent. Later the Statu board

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
The O. and O. steamship Doric arrived
in port from Hongkong, Yokohama and
Honolulu after midnight. She made a
fairly fast passage over and will" prob
ably dock to-day. >. ,
Steamer Doric Enters Port.
Mrs. Sarah Terry, white haired and
wrinkled and bowed by the weight of
seventy-six well-spent years, la anxiously
waiting for Attorney Chretien to return
to her $6500 which she says she let him
have "to put out at a good inlerest/' for
her. Mrs. Terry has been waiting a long
time for the money and yesterday for a
brief moment thought she as good as had
it, when she got a note from Chretien
asking her to call at his office, as he
wanted to square up. ] Chretien's- fashion
of "squaring up" was a bit of valued ad
vice to the effect that Mrs. Terry tell no
one of their little business transaction
and the Chretien promise to pay up very
shortly.
Mrs. Terry is a widow and Resides with
her son at 1121 Greenwich Â«treet. She met
Chretien shortly after the death of her
husband, which occurred In October, lbyo.
He was attending : to some' probate mat
ters for her, and by reason ot that perfect
confidence that must exist between client
and attorney Mrs. Terry told Chretien she
had some $&u00 In bank. Once the attorney
learned of the financial standing ot his
client he became extremely friendly to
ward her and visited the humble little
Greenwich-street home many times just
to pass a social quarter of an hour and
to offer, Incidentally, business advice. C
"He told me 1 was foolish to .leave my
money in bank," Mrs. Terry artlessly ex
plained. "Banked money, he said, brought
so very little interest, and he advised tnat
I lend my money out at S per cent, of
course getting good security for it."
Naturally Mrs. Terry fell in with Chre
tien's big money interest scheme, and
when the attorney came to her on the
Sth of August, '91, and said he knew some
one who wanted $200 on good security
and was willing to give .8 per cent per
month the old lady readily let her legal
adviser have it. The first $200 was so very
easy that Chretien came on September 12,
1S91, for $200 more on the same conditions.
Mrs. Terry said she thought the money
lending scheme was a splendid specula
tion, and so evidently did Chretien, for
three days after the last loan he returned
and borrowed for another friend $S00.
, On April 13, 1S92, Mrs. Terry's diary
shows she paid over to Chretien $200; on
the Cth of May, 1SS2, $500; September 3,
1S02, $1000; January 4, 1S93, $10u0; May 4,
1^3, $000, and July 15, 1S34, $500, all of which
Chretien said he was loaning out at high
interest to people who gave good security.
"At first the interest to the money was
paid in pretty regular," said Mrs. Terry.
"Then Chretien began to skip a month,
then two, "and then. I had to start in and
â¢dun' him for it. It is then 1 began to get
euspicious and I sent my son to his office
to get the addresses of the people I was
supposed to have lent the money to.
Chretien told him not to worry; said he
was personally responsible for the money
and drew up a note for the whole amount,
which he (Chretien) signed. In the mean
time he had got $1500 more from me. My
friend, Miss Meley, had a lawsuit on
hand and I gave to Mr. Chretien $1000,
which he was to use in Miss Meley' s in
terest as it became necessary. This
money he said he put in bank. The other
1500 I gave him for a man I was supposed
to have loaned, at an earlier date, $S00.
For the $1300 owed me I was to receive
$1500 in ninety days. When the ninety
days expired Chretien told me the man
who owed the money had dropped dead,
but not to worry, that he would be re
sponsible for the entire loan. Last Octo
ber Chretten made me the last payment
on account, and since that date I have
not received one cent from him."
The recent frequent mentionings of the
Chretien name in the daily papers have
alarmed Mrs. Terry, and the old lady
confesses that her nights are spent in
tears and her days in anxious waiting for
that money which she fears may never
now be returned to her.
"If I don't get that money back," she
said, "I don't know what I shall do. I
own this house I live in. but there are
taxes and other expenses to be met. , Un
less Chretien returns me my money
things will go hard with me, I fear."

Both horses were frightfully cut by the
broken glass and it was with considerable
difficulty that- they were prevented from
permanently injuring themselves. They

They allege that they are bookmakers
and pool sellers and that their business
is not gambling and that gambling is not
involved in it; that their incomes range
from $2500 to $5000 per annum; that their
business is worth from $2000 up; that or
dinances Â«5 and 68, if enforced, will deÂ«
prive them of the means of - livelihood;
that the ordinances abridge the privileges

There have been strange doings In the
American Box Company, according to the
allegations in the complaint of RÂ» P. Me
rillion, who Is suing the American Box
Company for a variety of things.
He alleges. In .the first place, that the
corporation is ruled by three of the five
directorsâ Thomas E. Ryan, J. W. Bar
tholomew and Henry Eulcr.
The plaintiff alleges that the company,
ruled by the three directors made defend
unts. has joined in a conspiracy with some
one in the employ of the quartermaster's
department of the army to defraud the
Government by putting in bills for more
merchandise than was rendered, and also
by raising the price of boxes and agree
ing that two of .the firms and no more
ehould secure Government contracts, the
fif^ms securing the contracts to pay to
those not bidding sufficient to compensate
them for their refusal to bid. It is al
leged that under the agreement among the
box factories the American Ilox Company
and Hobby & Wall* were- the only firms
that could secure contracts.
Another 1 allegation is that the three de
fendant directors. Ryan. Bartholomew and"
Euler. conspired to form a combination of
the box manufacturers under the name of
the Spruce Package Company, whk:h was
in fact a trust formed for the purpose of
unlawfully controlling the price and pro
duction of boxes, and into which each firm
put 5 per cent of its monthly sales. The
firms in the combine, according to the
complaint, were the American Box Com
pany, Hobbs & Wall. Pacific' Box Factory,
Greys Harbor Commercial Company and
the Clatsop Mill Company. All these were
combined under the name of the Spruce
Package Company. It is alleged in Meril
lion's complaint that the American Com
pany put in over $13,000 in payments and
dr^w a little more than $9000 in dividends.
There are further allegations of wrong
doing and shortage against Bartholomew,
and the complaint winds up with the
prayer that a receiver be appointed for the
company; that the defendant directors, a
majority of the board, be restrained from
entering Into any more combinations; that
thry be compelled to withdraw from the
Spruce Package Company, and that there
be a general accounting.

the question whether the Southern Pa

ship in fee of Sherman avenue, between
Wyoming avenue and the old San Jose
road, whereon is erected an obstructing
fence.
The city's legal adviser, in his opinion,
says that the official map shows that
Sherman avenue is &n open public street
and advises that the city remove the ob
struction immediately. Mr. Lane states
that Sherman avenue is designated upon
the Humphreys map of 1870 and the Tilton

the city should act upon the assumption
that these maps stare the truth.

Action on the ordinance limiting the
height of advertising fences to ten feet
and to be In full force and effect on July
1, 1901, was postponed for one week on
account of incorrect advertising. The
Mayor was of the opinion that the official
paper should be called to account for the
error. He said that if the ordinance had
been finally passed it would have been
invalidated by the insufficient publication.
"Something should be done to stop
further errors in this connection," Â«ai<l
his Honor. "Considerable interest at
taches to this measure and I do not know
but the beneficiaries might have appealed
to the paper."
The following protest against the final
passage of the ordinance was read and
referred to the Street Committee:
We, the undersigned citizens, residents and tax
payers of the city and county of San Francisco,
desire respectfully to call the attention of your
honorable body to the f act . that ' the ordinance
limiting the height of advertising fences now
pending before you will not in our opinion ac
'complish the purpose intended If finally passed
In its present condition. The said ordinance,
according to section 7, Is to take effect on July
1, 1901. In the meantime its operation is sus
pended. The owners of twenty and thirty foot
advertising fences may, therefore, continue
during the coming year to m&Ke contracts for
the use of their fences at will. In June, 1901,
they may without violating the law enter' Into
contracts which will extend over any number of
years thereafter. In, fact, as the ordinance is
proposed to be passed Its whole intent and pur
poses may In this way be defeated as to every
advertising fence now in existence- or which
may be erected during the year.
We also respectfully call attention to the fact
that on going into effect on July 1, 1901, this
ordinance cannot Interfere with any contract
for advertising on these fences valid at the time
of execution, for they v.-lll be valid after the
ordinance becomes an effective law.
As citizens and taxpayers we are Interested
In the regulation of these advertising- fences.
We therefore respectfully protest against the
passage of any ordinance which does not make
a decided beginning in , curtailing them. Â¦ No
legislation at all would be preferable to this
ordinance, because In the absence of action the
subject would be left cpen for further agitation
and ndjustment. We do not think your honor
able body should pass any ordinance which will
damage any of the blllpostlng firms now doing
business in this city, but advertising fences
should be regulated, and If It Is advisable to
extend the. time on those now In existence the
ordinance should declare In terms that no con
tract.entered Into between now and July 1, 1901.
shall be valid If extended beyond that date.
And your petitioners will ever pray.

Brandensteln presented, an ordinance
limiting the height of fences^ of whatever
character, to twenty feet. The ordinance
is framed to go into effect Immediately,
and shall be rescinded "when the ordinance
limiting them to ten feet becomes -a law,
on July 1, 1201.
Brandenstein explained that as the order
limiting the height of fences to ten feet
would not go into effect until July 1, 1901,
it would be wise to have an ordinance lim
iting them to some designated height.
"This ordinance,"- he said, "is aimed at
all. fences used for other purposes as well
as advertising. It is especially designed
to prevent the maintenance of 'spite
fences,' particularly the fence on -the
Crocker; lot,, on 'Sacramento, street, which
is an eyesore to the community. We have
no ; ordinance regulating . the height of
fences at present, and I deem it advisable
to have one on the statute books."
The Mayor stated that the' board had
set Its seal of approval 6n ten-foot fences,
and the billposters had agreed to abide by
the order and remove the higher fences
as soon as it went into effect. - * ,
The order. was referred to the joint Com
mittee on Judiciary and Streets. Â¦
To Limit Height of Fences.
The following resolution was adopted
without any comment:
Resolved, That a committee be appointed by
bis Honor the Mayor to draft 'amendments to
the charter of the city and county of San
Francisco for the purpose of reducing the ex
penses of administration, and to that end the
committee Is directed to make a maximum
limit beyond which Balarles cannot be raised,
and a. maximum limit beyond which the num
ber of places cannot be increased; and they are
further directed to provide a particular fund,
to be designated "The Public Improvement
Fund," which shall be devoted exclusively to
the making of public improvements as dis
tinguished from the payment of salaries, and
which said fund shall not be less than $300,000
per annum; also to report on whatever other
amendments to the charter may in their Judg
ment eeem requisite.
The following! communication was re
ceived from the Assessor:
A study of the assessment roll as made to
date enables me to assure your honorable body
that sufficient new personal property will be
assessed this year to provide for the repayment
of protested taxes amounting to about {42.000
In addition to current expenses and keep within
the |1 limit, as provided by the charter. This
would necessitate the addition of over $4,000,u00
to the estimated tax roll of $375,000,000, which
I now feel assured will be possible.

An ordinance was referred to the
Finance Committee providing that the
following appropriations contained In the
.budget for th'e fiscal year 1900-1901 shall
not be limited by monthly allowances:
Not Limited by One-Twelfth Act.
The ordinance providing revenue for
municipal purposes for the next fiscal
year was passed to print by the Super
visors at yesterday's meeting. The orig
inal estimate of a- tax levy of $1.1383 on
every $100 of a total assessed valuation
of $375,000,000 was reduced by the Finance
Committee to $1,127. the difference repre
senting the rate levied outside of the $1
limit to repay some $66,000 of protested
taxes, which rate has since declared to be
illegal by the Supreme Court. It was
pointed out by The Call last week that the
charter contained no provision permitting
the' levying of a tax to repay these
moneys and the committee showed that
it felt the force of the argument by
eliminating the item from the levy. These
taxes will be repaid only after a judg
ment has.been obtained against the city.
