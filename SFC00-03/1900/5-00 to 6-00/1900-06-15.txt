We condemn the Porto Rlean tariff law recently enacted by the present Republican Congresi

convention .'for the Vice Presi
dential nomination. It is fair to
assume that he did not suspect
that such an indorsement would
have any other meaning than to
tickle his vanity, but he wanted
the empty honor, and for weeks
his employes have been laboring
to win'^ it for. him. ' They worked
quietly; and hoped by exciting no
comment to grasp the prize with
out protest. .They. were literally
planning to steal the indorsement
of the Yellow Kid from the con
vention. They came to Sacra
mento. with a blare of trumpets.
They induced three prominent
Democrats to act in the doubtful
capacity of "special commis
sioners," -whatever that may
mean,- in the home of the Yellow
â¢Kid. They â¢ told what a great
convention was to assemble at
Sacramento.; They flattered, ca
joled, pleaded, and to-night there
is' sadness and sorrow in their
camp.
HEARST BAFFLED.
Hearst was denied the prize he
sought. The CaH Â¦ exposed the
scheme this morning and the con
vention; reeled back from the
precipice, of: absurdity; toward
which it; was plunging.
The committee on platform and
resolutions decided that the Dem
ocracy of California cannot go
so far.as tojndorse the Yellow
Kid in his ambition. There was a
battle royal to-day in the commit
tee when Hearst's name was
suggested. Leading Democrats
whose sense of the ridiculous is
keen protested against saddling
the Democracy of California with
the Hearst individuality. They
spoke plain, and it must be said
bluntly. Mr. Hearst would not
have been pleased with the pict
ure which his Democratic friends
drew of him. His partisans were
frightened from their position and
they were more than gratified
when the committee agreed, in a
desire to heal the wound of de
feat, to commend Hearst to the
goodwill of Democrats for his
fidelity, financial and otherwise,
to the Democratic party.
WAS A HUGE JOKE.
. The decision of the committee
was a long cry from a Vice Pres
idential indorsement, but Mr.
Hearst's employes, it must be
said/ are taking the outcome phil
osophically. Indeed,- they were

others saw it, a huge joke, in-

CALL HEADQ UAR
TERS, SACRAMENTO,
June 14. â The Demo
cratic State Convention has met
and adjourned. The delegates
are talking to-night- of the bat-
ties that were lost and won and
in the glass of good fellowship
party quarrels and excitement
are forgotten. The political
body which has held the interest
of the city for a day met to elect
delegates to the National Demo
cratic Convention, and it is safe
to say that nine out of every ten
hurrahing Democrats do, not
know the names of the men they
have chosen to represent the
Democracy of the State at Kan
sas City. The election of na
tional delegates became in the
convention a matter of minor
concern and to-night gossiping
Democracy is confiding to itself
the results of the big meeting.
SIGNIFICANT RESULTS.
This convention will long be
remembered in the councils of
the Democracy of California as
an assemblage of more than ordi
nary interest. It accomplished
three positive and significant re
sults.
It registered the political death
of James D. Phelan, the Mayor of
San Francisco.
It repudiated, with an asser-

spired in the best of good humor
and never intended to be serious.
While they are inclined to
take this view, of -the -.situation,
their special commissioners do
not. This interesting group ot
yellow kids has surprised its
friends in the convention. The
most humorous aspect of the ap
pearance of the kids here is per
j haps involved in the fact that
they take themselves seriously..
They give painful indications
that the burden of the pen is
heavy upon them. By common
ex-Governor Budd was
shorn to-day of his prerogative
as censor in chief. Last night he
labored long and earnestly with
Maguire in an effort to dissuade
him from-" writing anything. Il
Maguire has learned anything it
is that ink, even when inoculated,
should be used with discretion.
But last night he turned a dear
ear to the pleadings of Budd and
the result was that the other com-
missioner, waiting for the censor
ship, failed to prepare his liter
ary effusion in time for the Yel
low Kid. Maguire was disheart
ened, Budd was disgusted. Phc-
Ian was insulted and the Yellow
Kid was thrown upon his own re
sources.
As a result he overlooked the
news of the convention and wa3
chagrined this morning to read
in The Call the platform and
nominees of the convention, the
name of the chairman of the new
State Central Committee and the
expose of his own schemes. So
he determined upon a reorgani
zation of the special commission
ers, and Mayor Phelan was elect
ed commissioner in chief. And
the arrangement was just. As an
observer remarked, the editor of
the yellow sheet of San Francisco
has. acted for a long time as the
Mayor of the metropolis and it
was no more than common jus
tice to permit the Mayor of San
Francisco, for a short time, to act
as editor of the yellew sheet.
PHELAN SNUBBED.
With this honor Mayor Phelan
must rest content. He has re
ceived none other from the con
vention which has just adjourned.
He has played no part in its de
liberationSf he has done nothing
to suggest or dictate its policy.

PLATFORM OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRACY.vince himself that politics is a
game worth knowing.
McNab has not only absorbed
the organization of the Demo
cratic party in the State but he
has reached out his grasping fin
gers and laid them upon national
politics. He has dictated who
shall be the chairman of the
Democratic delegation to Kansas
City, and he has given the honor
to Stephen M. White. With the
same apparent unconcern which
has characterized all of his ac
tions, McNab has named the rep
resentative of California on the
Democratic National Committee,
and by his courtesy Jasper Mc-
Donald will receive that honor.
When some of the protesting
leaders were fighting to-day
against the appointment.- of a
State Central Committee, Mc-
Nab was an interested spectator.
He knew better than his oppo
nents what their policy should
have been, and when they, in an
effort to save themselves from
absolute defeat, attempted to
amend tne proposed organiza
tion of the State Central Commit
tee by giving to each Congres
sional district three delegates in
stead of two, McNab was honest-
lan, commissioner extraordinary
for the Yellow Kid, communed
with himself in an effort to con-
journed to-night he had won the
only significant victory of the
session. And then Mavor Phc-
to McNab that he has taught pol
iticians the lesson of an unbend
ing rod of authority. He named
the chairman, he chose the com
mittees, he dictated the policy ot
organizers and platform makers.
He made himself absolute mnster
of the situation and apparently
without effort seized the Demo
cratic organization for the nex-t
two years.
. Some of the leaders in the con
vention fought strenuously to
day against the appointment of a
State Central Committee, which
is the impelling machinery of the
party. McXab gave his order
that a State Central Committee
should be chosen and the oppos
ing leaders discovered that their
protests had been in vain. The
committee was elected. McNab
had won the only victory in
which he was concerned. He has

CONVENTION REFUSES TO [\[
DECLARE FOR MAINTENANCE
OF SOVEREIGNTY IN PHILIPPINES
>^ALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, June ,
\j 14. â J. Marion Brooks made a gallant struggle to ob
tain a declaration from the convention that the sov- '
ereignty of the United States should be maintained in the <
Philippines and that the obligations of the treaty should be
respected. Delegates sought to avoid the issue by suppress
ing the resolution, but Brooks was persistent. He declared i
that California was in favor of giving good government to
the Philippines, intimating that any political party that de
clared otherwise or failed to express its principles* on the 5
subject named had no show of winning the Legislature. <
When the Brooks resolution vvas read as an amendment to
the report of the platform committee there was a storm of '
dissent. Mention of Admiral Dewey as a Jeffersonian Dem- <
ocrat failed to evoke applause. The delegates were full of
resentment growing out of the suggestion that the flag .
should float over the islands. By an overwhelming vote the s
amendment was rejected. * '
If he can read as others he can
translate .out of the convention
results the registration of his
own political death. He was con
sulted upon nothing. He accept
ed what others were willing to
give to him and the empty honor
of becoming a national delegate
was his simply because his per
sonality was not interesting
enough to prompt an organized
antagonism. Mayor Phelan is in
that peculiar condition of being
politically overfed. His greed for
power has gorged and when the
convention adjourned to-night he
had received his last feast at the
party board.
ly amused. He had prepared de
liberately for {he trap and in
seeming to grant a concession
had absorbed more power. The
enthusiastic delegates who want
ed three representatives instead
of two forgot that four of the
Congressional districts border on
San Francisco Bay. The dele
gates won their point and Mc-
Nab gained more complete
power over the committee which
he already controlled.
DEMOCRATIC WORKS
IN CHARGE OF McNAB
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. June 14.â Delegates began to as
semble at the pavilion as early as 10
o'clock, the time appointed for the conven
tion to meet. Fifty-five minutes later the
chairman of the State Central Committee
claimed their attention. The waiting time,
however, was not wasted, as there was a
j rush of business at the secretary's desk
: in recording the long list of proxies. In
; little throngs within the pavilion and in
j the sunlight outside the Democrats dis
i cussed the programme and figured on the
I chances of getting through the work In
| hand some time this evening. Those who
cared to individualize noted that little Jim
Phc-lan, the smallest cf the Jim trio of
Yellow Kid special -commissioners, wore
a natty straw hat with a trolley. The
j silkf n tile of the plug shape was put aside
j early this mornlr.g. as an Intimation had
been thrown out that Gavin McNab did
1 not approve'of the wearing of silk hats
! at the forenoon session of a Democratic
j State gathering. It vras oDserved that
j Charles W. Fay, the Mayor's private Civil
I Service Commissioner, was inclined to
j burn incense in the immediate proximity
j of Mr. McNab. The clever Scotch boss
! did not encourage Fay in this diversion.
| It was recognized that the Mayor's daily
j allowance of sweet incense should not be
; suddenly cut en*. The quantity admin
: iFtered may be daily diminished until the
: Mayor is able to get along without It Of
! course, the Mayor of San Francisoo will
! feel lonely and sad without either in
! cense or Phelonic plague, but in his lone
j liness and sorrow he may devote himself
! to yellow literature.
McNab Head Boss.
Every one on the Inside recognized early
j this morning that Gavin McNab had cap
j tured the Democratic works. He is boss
| In-chief of all, the clans. When Senator
I Sims was proclaimed chairman of the
! committee on plans to organize the party
\ for the campaign, even the rank outsider
J perceived the skilled manipulation of
i Gavin McNab. Fr.-ink H. Gould enter
! tained a fleeting fancy that he (Gould)
would be a good man to prepare the cam
paign plans and ultimately achieve the
j honor cf serving as chairman of the Dem
â¢ ocratic State Central Committee. His
| fond hopes were abruptly shattered when
| Bryan's double from Visalia appointed the
j Sonoma Senator, Sims, to the chairman-
ship of the committee. Gould must have
been shocked as well as surprised, because
it was on his own motion that the con
vention authorized the chair to appoint
the committee of eleven to present plans
for the management of the campaign.
Gavin McNab accorded to Frank Gould
the henor of placing E. C. Farnsworth in
nomination for chairman of the conven
tion. The discriminating Scotch boss dif-
fused his favors and gave to Ed E. Leake
of Yolo the sweet solace of seconding, on
J>ehalf of the tules, the man from Tulare
who bears such a striking. resemblance to
Bryan. V',:
Frank Gould's speech deploring the de
parture of the rulers of the country from
principles cherished by the framers of the
Declaration of Independence was the same
kind of a speech that the critics of Jeffer
son made when the statesman of Monti
cello proposed to add the country west of
the Mississippi River to the national do
main. Statesmen of the Gould size were
then convinced that the constitution would
never be expanded to cover territory so
far west and south.
Double of the Boy Orator.
When E. C. Farnsworth marched to the
platform escorted by Delegates Gould and
Leake he looked the veritable double. of
Bryan. His hair was arranged a la Bryan.
He had the Bryan stride and the Bryan
habit of opening his mouth to address an
audience. There the resemblance ended.
The silvery tone was missing and the
mental capacity to put thoughts Into
words wa"v absent. It was the gossip that
FarnEworth was made up for the occasion,
and many regretted that the makeup was
not extended.

MENTO, June 14.â At 10:55 a. m. Seth
Mann, 'chairman of t the Democratic State

tion to order. He spoke as follows:
" Gentlemen and Fellow. Democrats: We have
assembled here to-day, pursuant to .the call <jf
the Democratic National 'Comaalttee. for the
purpose of electing delegates to the Democratic
National Convention, which meets in Kansas
City on July 4th next*
I apprehend that the delegation that you shall
choose will be men whoorill stand for that
typical American, whose very name is a Demo
cratic platform, the Hon. William J. Bryan.
(Cheers.) Furthermore, . I apprehend-' that this
convention , will/ place itself in line with most
of the conventions that 'have; thus far 'assem
bled and nominated delegates and will make

United State* as' near to the people as possible^ '
Organization Committee's Report De
manded.
Mr. Gesfordâ I rise to a question of in
formation. I ask the chairman of the
committee on permanent organization and
order of business If they have a report to
make.
The Chairman â They have a report to
make.
Mr. Oesfordâ Then I move that we take
up that report.
D. G. Reid of Shastaâ Gentlemen of the
convention, the committee on resolutions
came here with a request by a vote to
you that you will give them the justice
and right of being here when any proposl.
tion is voted on that 13 of importance. Wo
appointed a sub-committee of six to draft
resolutions; that committee 'was to report
to the entire committee at 4 o'clock. They
instructed the members by a vote to comÂ»
here and ask this convention not to do
any business except to receive the reports
of the committee on credentials and the
committee on permanent organization,
and that where there was any contest
that matter might go over until the full
convention could be present. And in .us
tice we ask you to do that. (Applause.)
Mr. Gessford â Mr. Chairman, I press my
request. In accordance with the state
ment of the gentleman who Just left the
platform we are entitled now to a report
of that committee on permanent organi
zation and order of business. If there Is
any contest that can be disposed of after
ward. The gentleman who has Just left
the platform stated if there was a contest
the committee on resolutions would like to
be heard. Let us hear the report. We
can determine then whether there is a
contest or not. Let us expedite matters
and receive that report at leastâ and I
now demand it of the committee.
The Chairmanâ The question is on thÂ©
motion to take a recess until 5 o'clock.
Are you ready for the question?
Major Mooreâ I rise to a point of order.
My understanding of the motion is that
when the convention adjourns it adjourns
to meet at 5 o'clock and not now to take a
recess. I want to say to the chair while
on my feet, talking about the committee
on resolutionsâ but one single resolution
has been offered for that committee to
decide, and I take it that the committee
is now working upon something: without
knowing what it is that this convention
wants them to pas3 upon. I hope before
we leave here that the members of thia
convention will have an opportunity to
offer resolutions to that committee, other
wise we are sitting here with a commit
tee on resolutions and only one resolution
before It from this convention.
Delegate McKinnon â I second the motion
of Senator Gessford. I am a member of
that committee on organization and order
of business. There is nothing before it
whatever. The committee Is ready to re
port. The report ousrht to be received,
and then, if anything springs out of it
that might need debate the motion of Mr.
Storke can come up.
Declined to Take a Recess.
The Chairmanâ The vote upon the mo
tion on the point of taking a recess will
determine that point. All those who are
In favor of taking a recess until 5 o'clock
will signify by saying aye. The motion
was lost.
The Chairmanâ The report of the com
mittee on permanent organization and or
der of business is in order. Is that com
mittee ready to report?
Chairman Fulkerthâ I now present the
report of the committee on permanent
organization and order of business.
The secretary read the report, the same
being as follows:
We. your committee on permanent organiza
tion and order of business, beg leave to report
as follows: , m
Firstâ We recommend that the temporary offi
cers of the convention be made the permanent
officers thereof. .
Secondâ That the following be adopted aa the

The Chairmanâ The question is on taÂ»
adoption of the report.
fiudge Storkeâ Now. Mr. Chairman. I
move that this convention take a recess
until 5 o'clock, because in that report that
has just been presented. Is a provision for
the election of a State Central Committee.
The laws of the State of Californiaâ the
primary law of this State, which governs
the election of a State Central Commit
teeâbear on this point.
Fairweather of Fresnoâ I make the mo
tion that we take up the report of the
committee on permanent organization

then pass upon every part until we come
to the disputed part, and if we then take
n recess we will only have the disputed
part to debate upon. Let us take- up the
balance. of the report.
The motion was put and carried.
The Chairmanâ The secretary will read
the first item of the report.
Mr Hillyerâ 1 move you. Mr. Chairman,
that all of the report of the committee

Upon motion of E. D. McCabo at San

took a recess until 3 o'clock p. m., at
which hour the convention resumed busi

The report was thereupon adopted.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, June
14- â Mention of two names always aroused the con
vention to a high degree of enthusiasm. The names
were those of William J. Bryan and Stephen M. White.
When ex-Senator White arose to speak on the subject of
referring" all resolutions to the committee, he received a
great and spontaneous ovation from his fellow Democrats.
The tribute, no doubt highly acceptable to him, was con
strued by many as a pointed rebuke to the Democratic
members of the last Legislature who devised a cunning
programme to deprive the illustrious Democrat of the honor
of receiving the complimentary vote of the minority for
United States Senator. Mr. White is magnanimous in the
extreme. If he had indicated to-day the slightest desire
th'at the undeserved, recipient of the Senatorial compliment
should receive no recognition from the convention, the del
egates would have shown Phelan the door. Later in the day
Mr. White went to tl\e rescue of James G. Maguire, a Dem
ocrat who was knifed in the camp of his party two years ago.

Itebate on Referring of Resolutions.
After the foregoing committees were
announced J. Marlon Brooks of Los An
geles, recently from Manila, sought to in
troduce a resolution. He said to the con
vention: "I have a resolution which I
wish to offer and I would like to have the
same read and referred to the committee
on platform and resolutions."
Stephen M. Whiteâ Mr. Chairman, I
move that all resolutions prepared or In
troduced by any one upon the floor of this
convention be referred to the committee
on resolutions -without debate.
Mr. Brooksâ I move to amend that reso
lution.
The Chairmanâ I have not put the ques
tion. Gentlemen, you have heard the mo
tion which has Just been made. Are you
ready for the question?
Mr. Brooksâ I move to amend that mo
tion, that all resolutions be first read and
then be referred to the committee with
debate.
Senator White â An amendment to an
amendment being in order, I move that
all resolutions be referred to the commit
tee on resolutions, without reading and
without debate. (Cheers.)
Motion seconded.
Mr. Brooksâ Mr. Chairman, and gentle
men of this conventionâ There Is no at
tempt here, upon the part of anybody, I
hope, to throttle any gentleman who has
views which would perhaps aid the Dem
ocratic party. There is no desire upoi. the
part of any person who sits In this con
vention to throttle any person who is
present here to-day, who has views upon
questions of importance which might
mean the success of the Democratic
party. I, for one, have views upon ques
tions that will come before this conven
tion that I deslre^
R. M. Fitzgeraldâ Mr. Chairman, can we
proceed with any business until the com
mittee on credentials reports? I make
that point of order. /
The Chairmanâ I think the point of or
der is well taken.
Mr. Brooks^ â Gentlemen. I do not pro
pose to speak but a moment and I hope
you will bear with me patiently with
what I have got to say and that is this:
I believe that all resolutions which are
presented to this convention, for the pur
pose of Information should be read; then
we can refer them to the proper commit
tee. That is the only objection I have to
Senator White's motion. I believe that
we should know the minds of this conven
tion. I have a resolution here that J have
sent to the desk. I would like to speak
upon that resolution, because if that reso
lution is defeated we cannot elect one
member of the Legislature of this State.
Asher Wants Resolutions R^ad.
Hugo Asher of San Franciscoâ Mr.
Chairman: I desire to say just a word
in favor of the motion that resolutions
shall be read and referred without debate
to the committee. S If this convention
holds contrary to that motion, it means
that every man in thia convention stands
tied hand and foot, and that he has no
right to express or bring before the con
vention his sentiments unless .they are
approved by such committee as It may be
referred to. It asks nothing further than
to permit the resolution to be read. It
does not ask the privilege to debate it,
but permits that to be done In committee,
and the committee may then determine
whether there is enough merit In the res
olution to warrant its being brought be
fore the convention; but before that
power is given the committee, a due and
proper check is kept upon it to the ex
tent that the convention itself Is made at
least a partial judge as to the propriety
of that resolution. The opposition to per
mitting the resolution to be read before
this convention is much more far-carry
ing than would appear upon first blush.
As I said in the beginning, it stifles the
sentiment and the ideas of any man In
this convention and bars him from such
proper participation in the councils of
the party as he is entitled to by virtue
of having been made a delegate to this
convention, end the carrying of the
amendment to the amendment to the
motion to the effect that it shall not
even be read is not a Democratic propo
sition, in spite of the fact that it comes
from the best Democrat In the State;
and I therefore, Mr. Chairman and gen
tlemen of this convention, hope that you
will permit these resolutions to be read
before you send them to the committee.
If you do not, there may be some of you
who Intend to Introduce resolutions;
there may be whole delegations that in
tend to Introduce resolutions, and that
will be prevented from bringing their ideas
before this convention If the amendment
to the amendment is carried, and it
should not be carried.
Senator Whiteâ The- gentleman from
San Francisco utterly misconceives the
purport and effect of the amendment
which I suggested. As soon as the re
port of the committee is made that report
is subject to amendment and any one de
siring to propose an amendment can do
so. My object in offering the amendment
was this: It is customary in Democratic
gatherings and it has been done in two
Democratic national conventions over
which I had the honor to preside and per
haps their teachings of Democracy may
be sufficiently adequate to meet the pres
ent occasion. (Applause.) In the interest
of time and not to throttle any one I have
made the motion. ' Let the motion carry.
Any gentleman desiring can propose his
amendment; that amendment will go to
the committee. If the committee's report
is unsatisfactory the resolutions may be
read, reread, debated and redebated upon
this floor and Â¦ no one will be prevented
from giving his view, but. primarily, the
committee which we appoint has a right
to pass upon those resolutions and their
report to this convention will be subject
to the revision of its membership. It
was in the interests of orderly and rapid
procedure that I made the suggestion and
not to curtail the speech of any one or to
deprive any member of this convention of
the opportunity of addressing at length,
as is his privilege, this body. (Applause./
White's Amendment Carries.
The Chairmanâ The question is on the
adoption of the amendment to the amend
ment, to the effect that all resolutions
shall go to the resolutions- committee
without being read or debated. Carried.
Following is a copy of the Brook3 reso
lution which was suppressed but subae-
and imperialism that party has surrendered to
the money power of this land. Being in run
control of the Government it has enacted tariff
legislation whose hurdensome taxation on an
the necessities of life weighs heaviest on^ the
common people. It has enacted an iniquitous
stamp act. the prime purpose of which is to
squeeze more revenue from the masses. It has
fostered trusts in recompense for campaign
support until all save the financial barons are
menaced by reason of this condition. It has
enacted a law making gold the money stand
ard and has rut the control of the volume of
our money In the hands of the national banks,
thereby surrendering this paramount govern
mental function to private control.
The war which has been fought and won was
declared with the approval of this country to
free Y*n oppressed and suffering people, who
were promised the Inestimable blessing of self
government; and the invincible hosts of a
united nation won a triumphant victory. But
when the purpose of that war was accom
plished the administration now In power for
got all the sublime principles of our Declara
tion of Independence and, in Its greed for gain,
would float nur flat in conquest and deny the
guarantees of our constitution to the con
quered. (Applause.) Anft now we behold old
time Republican leaders in open rebellion at
the policy of that partyâ that party whose
record has been a shrine to money and not to
men; whose eign manual Is the dollar mark;
the party that has turned down the principles
of Abraham Lincoln to wear the livery of.
Mark Hanna. (Applause.)
The reform forces of this country are stronger
and more united to-day than ever bofore. The
Democracy stands now, as it has always stood,
the champion and defender of the rights of the
plain people of this country. It advocates, and
has always advocated, that this Government
should not be administered in favor of any
class, rich or poor, but that all classes, rich
and poor alike shall always have equal rights
before the law. (Applause.) Four years ago
the Democratic party crystallized its principles
in the Chicago platform, and. while new issues
have since arisen, still the Chicago platform of
1826 Is. in letter and spirit, the guide of De
mocracy now as it was then. (Applause.)
Those same grand truths are the essentials
of free government, and while we believe In
that platform we also know that in order to
preserve this Government it is necessary to
crush the trusts and forever destroy that spirit
of imperialism and militarism now advocated
by the Republican party. And to that end the
principles of our Declaration of Independence
should be burned into the hearts of all loyal
Americans, so that our country will ever be as
Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln left it.
(Applause.).
If the liberty of-this country is to be pre
served it must be through that party that
founds its : faith on the Declaration of Inde
pendence, and that Is the Democratic party,
the party, of liberty. Justice and equality, the
party that believes that the benefits and bur
dens of government should fall on all alike;
the party that' believes that the constitution of
this country protects all alike, wherever the
American flag floats In sovereign right: the
party that believes that we have an American
liberty enshrined on the threshold of every
home, where, within the sacred circle of the
fireside, love burns its brightest Intense and
men are kings uncrowned and women queens
supreme (applause) â a liberty whose foremost
champion Is that intellectual prince of giants,
who towerg head and shoulders above all living
statesmen, the next President of the United
States, the Hon. William Jennings Bryan.
(Great cheering and applause.) He will lead
the hosts of Democracy to triumphant victory,
and our republic will remain the embodiment of
liberty and the home of the free.

Hon. George H. Clark, Mayor of Sac
ramento, then welcomed the delegates to
the city with the following well-chosen
remarks:
n- Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention: It Is with genuine pleasure that
I come before you to bid you welcome to the
Capitol .City. We sincerely appreciate the
honor, of. acting as host to so dignified a body
aa the State Democratic Convention.
. We of. this city feel that it is especially fit
ting that gatherings of the men who frame the
policies that control or Influence the control
of, the State.. and in a measure that of the
nation, should be held at the seat of govern
ment. - I recognize In this gathering the repre
sentatives of one of .the great political factors
of the day; the representatives of a party that
has had and doubtless always will have ' a
potent ."influence for upholding: and fostering
the welfareof this, nation, and for the preser
vation of thegreat..princlplea of human liberty.
(Applause).;'- -â¢;.' â¢ ., \
- It Is upon 'such occasions as this that every
citizen ""should glvÂ« attention to the thought
that .the. very' foundation 'of tour institutions is
laid in the" conventions of the ' political parties
which afford opportunities for the expression
of the ideas -fend plans that- result 1 in the ex
emplification of good citizenship. My observa
tion permits 'me to say right here that too
much respect cannot be paid, the dignity of a
convention such as this. To-.you.i8 entrusted
the power of determining the policies for your
people.
. I say, therefore, that you as representatives
of those who stand for the principles of Democ
racy are entitled to our highest consideration
and esteem, and I bid you welcome *-> the
city of Sacramento and trust that your de
liberations will bring honor and glory to our
State and nation and satisfaction to your con
stituents. (Cheers).
Stay with us until you are sure you are
ready to leave, and then stay awhile longer.
For the rest of the week we are all Democrats I
â and you may make permanent converts of
us all. Again I bid you welcome.
Organization Discussion.
Delegate L. "W. Fulkerth- of . Stanislaus
moved that a committee of fifteen be ap
pointed by the chair on permanent organi
zation and order of business.
Stephen M. Whiteâ I suggest that thÂ©
first committee to be appointed is the
committee on credentials.
Chairman Farnsworthâ I think the sug
gestion of Senator "White is a timely one,
and 1 think correctâ that the first com
mittee should be the committee on creden
tials. â¢ â¢
A. R. Denike of Santa Clara moved that
a committee of fifteen on credentials be
appointed by the chair. The motion was
Â¦seconded, put- and carried. â¢
The motion of Delegate Fulkerth being
renewed for the appointment of a commit
tee on permanent organization and order
of business, the same having- been second
ed, was put by the chair and carried.
S. Bachrach of Alamedaâ I move you.
Mr. Chairman, that a like .committee of
the same number be appointed on resolu
tions.
W. H. Alford of San Franciscoâ I move
you, sir, that the chairman of this con
vention appoint from, the body of the con
vention a committee of thirty-five on res
olutions and platforms.
The motion of Delegate Alford was put
and carried.
Frank H. Gould of San Franciscoâ I
move that a committee of eleven be qp
polnted for the purpose of preparing and
reporting to this convention a plan for the
organization of the party in the State of
California for the coming campaign. ThÂ©
motion was seconded.
R. F. del Valle of Los Angelesâ I sub
mit. Mr. Chairman, that a motion for the
appointment of a committee -for the fur
ther control and management of the party
Is out of order.
i Mr. Gouldâ Mr. Chairman. I think the
point of order is not well taken. This as
sembly has met here for the purpose of
I organizing itself. It has a right to move
Â¦ for the organization of those committees,
( if the convention as organized so desires.
, The Chairmanâ I think- the point of or
. der is not well taken. AH those in favor
i of the motion
i Mr. del Valleâ Mr. Chairman, how can
. you appoint a committee from a body
' which is not organized, when you do not
know who the members of that body are?
How can they take permanent charge of
a campaign when the body of which
they are selected is not recognized as a
convention? s
' Judge C. A. Storke of Santa Barbara-
Mr. Chairman, -how can we with simply
a temporary chairman, dd any business
-except organize this body? I agree with
the gentleman from Los Angeles that the
point of order is well taken. I Insist that
we^ cannot, until we are properly organ
ized, do any other business than organize.
*u r- Gouldâ I arise to the point of order
that the gentleman is out of order because
the chair has already ruled.
Judge Storkeâ Then we appeal from the
ruling of the chair.
A voice from the rearâ I would like to
â¢ pearwhat that point is. We' cannot hear
in this end of the hall.
Mr. del Valleâ Mr. Chairman, the point
or order is that we arÂ« as yet not a per
manem^organization. We as yet do not
know who the members of this body are;
and how can you appoint a committee
from a body which does not exist? The
only matter before this convention Is the
temporary organization of this body, and
for that purpose the committee on creden
tials has been appointed to return to this
body who the members shall be. After we
have permanent organization then we can
| select from the body of the convention
any persons we choose for a committee.
The functions of this committee which is
Intended to be organized is to take charge
of the campaign until election day. and
therefore you have to know from whom
to select, which is not known now and
cannot he known until the credentials
committee shall make its return.
Hugo Asher of San Franciscoâ I think
that there is no doubt that the position
taken by the previous speaker is the cor
rect one. and I believe that a mistake was
even made when we appointed a commit
tee on platform and resolutions now. be
fore we have gone into permanent organi
zation. And while it is probably unneces
sary to rectify that mistake nowâ because
I presume that the temporary chairman
will be the permanent chairman of thia
convention â there is really no need for us
to continue in that course and make a
further blunder in the same direction.
Nothing is lost by sticking to the correct
ruleâ to take no further motions or pre
sent no further motions, except those that
are necessary to complete the organiza
tion of this convention; and, with all due
deference to the chair, I think it is mis
taken in its ruling, and the chair ought to
be reversed. *
N. K. Young of Los Angelesâ Air. Chair
man, with reference to this matter Sen
ator del Valle's expression on that sub
ject seems to have some force, but it
strikes me that if this convention, as a
temporary organization, can appoint a
committee on platform and resolutions
and other committees that it has appoint
ed, the same power which gives the con
vention the right to appoint a committee
on resolutions gives it the right to nppoint
the committee suggested by Mr. Gould.
Mr. Fairweather of Fresnoâ Mr. Chair
man, if I understood aright the motion of
Mr. Gould it was simply that a commit
tee of eleven persons be appointed to rec
ommend a manner of organization for the
coming campaign â not a committee to
take charge of the campaign, but simply
to recommend ways and means for what
we shall do in organizing the various dis
tricts. Mr. del Valle, I believe, is on the
wrong track. I believe that this conven
tion has newer it appoint a committee as
suggested by Mr, Gould, and we ought to
have that committee, and have it now.
Mr. Gould â I am inclined to believe that
there is a misunderstanding on the part
of the delegates in relation to the char
acter of the committee that I had sug
gested, although I think Tny motion was
plain. Probably it was owing to the fact
that my voice was not heard. The only
thing that I desired to move in the nature
of a committee was a committee of eleven
for the purpose of simply making sug
gestions and reporting back to this con
vention and that the committee would
then dissolve and cease to exist, exactly
as the- committee on platform and resolu
tions, the committee on credentials arid
the committee upon permanent organiza
-tion and order of business. It is an ex
actly similar committee to those, except
that it has a slightly different function
looking toward suggestions that may ap
peal to the different members of this con
vention, to take with them when they go
home. If there is a point made that the
motion that I make is out of order then
every motion that is made Is equally out
of order and you cannot even have a
committee on credentials. I think. Mr.
Chairman, that while it may be theo
retically incorrect, yet practically, as
these matters are usually administered in
conventions, the method that we have
thus far followed and exactly the method
that my motion suggests, is the proper
one and I think it is in order. I think
the opposition should be withdrawn and
let us go on in the interest of harmony
and of time and let these committees be
appointed and get to work. "We don't
want to stay here all day â we don't want
to stay here an hour or two after this
convention convenes for the appointment
of that committee.
After further discussion of a concilia
tory character Delegate Storke withdrew
his appeal and the motion to appoint a
committee of eleven was carried.
A recess of thirty minutes was taken.

NEW STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. ,
) and will Instruct their delegates to vote for
j William J. Bryan for the Presidency. (Cheers.)
I wish to take this opi>ortunity, gentlemen, to
call to your attention a communication received
by the chairman of your State Central Com
mittee, signed by the chairman of the National
Democratic Committee, the Hon. James K.
Jones. It is. in. brief, that we should exercise
the utmost care at our next convention, which
will assemble some time after the Hth or Au
gust of this year, in the selection of Electors to
place upon our ticket in this State. Senator
Jones lays particular stress upon the fact that
we should avoid all possible complication and
all possible questions that may arise by select
ing only those persons as Electors whose eligi
bility is beyond any question. He says in his
letter: "Even if we are sure of the eligibility
of an Elector or a candidate for Elector we
should not place him upon the ticket if any
question could be raised about him."
I state that now. In order that it may re
ceive publicity throughout the Democratic party
and in order that in presenting candidates for
Electors at the future convention we may bear
In mind this caution of the chairman of the
National Committee to proceed in such a way
that no question or no suggestion of error may
arise, in view of that victory for the Demo
cratic party which I take pleasure in saying I
think we att believe is about to come to us
this time. (Applause.)
And one thing moro. and that is, that in the
State of California I think it is extremely neces
sary that we should all enthusiastically and
earnestly devote ourselves toward the proposi
tion of organizing the party in every precinct
of the State. I believe that by such an organi
zation we can carry â¢ this State In November
next, and by that means principally we shall
be able to do *o.
You will soon hear from your managing and
governing committees- concerning this matter.
I think 1 am justified in stating vhat a uniform
plan of precinct organization will soon be
ndopte-i by our committee, and I ask of you
all upon your return to your respective counties
that you carry with you a feeling of enthu
siasm for this plan of organization, and that
when it is lirousht to you. >wu will all take
hold of it. bo that we may have an organiza
tion of the Democratic party In' the State of
California which shall be permanent and con
tinuous. Gentlemen, nominations for tempor
ary chairman are now in order.
Frank H. Gould of San Francisco arose
and securing: recognition began to ad
dress the con%-entlon. In response to de
mand he went to the platform to make
his speech placing in nomination E. C.
Farnsworth of Tulare. Mr. Gould sam:
Farnsworth Nominated for Chairman.
Mr Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: â¢ Since last the Democratic party gath
ered together by its representatives in the fatate
of California there have been most momentous
events that have occurred In the history of our
countryâ events that are bound to stamp upon
the history of thece United States a destiny
that perhaps you nor I would not wish, but
â¢which perhaps you nor I cannot avert. \ve
have seen, during the last two or three years,
the acquisition of territory by treaty and by
conquest, separated from our mother country
by thousands of miles of ocean, and we. have
s.een a system of government proposed by the
dominant party to which I believe the LX?mo
cratic party of America can never give their
assent. (Applause.) We have seen propositions
made, and made In earnest, to depart from
the tenets of our fathers. laid down by their
words and their examples through a century
of unparalleled progress In America. "VN e have
seen the constitution twisted aside as though
it was not the sacred Instrument that America
has taught Its sons to believe In the past that it
Is. and we have seen that sacred Declaration of
Independence, which we have looked to-âour
selves and our progenitorsâ and ; which we
hoped our posterity might look to as the great
landmark of liberty throughout the world; we
have eeen the principles of that Declaration of
Independence derided and made FDort of .by
those who have advocated principles entlrely
at variance with those there laid down. (Ap-.
plause.) And the great Democratic party, true
as ever to the principles of Democracy and of
freedom; true as ever to the principles that the
consent of the governed Is necessary to govern
ment. Is rallying throughout these : United .
States with the hope and with the determina
tion to preserve for our posterity 1 those ines
timable privileges that- were given to us by our
progenitors. (Applause.) I
At such a time as this it Is a splendid thing
In our history that there stands forth one mag
nificent character In the history of the world; a
man whose every action is founded solely in
principle; a man whose actions know not the
domination of self-interest: a man who repre
sents the- people â the real . pe<JPlerÂ«f this great
country as perhaps no man has represented
them in the last decadeâ William Jennings
Bryan. (Applause.) . ..,
With such a representative as thatâ with such
a leader as thatâ the Democratic hosts will. In
this fall elecetlon. as- eure-lyaa the sun shines
tQrday,' be led to a most magnificent and glo
rious victory. (Cheers.)'.;'*' V
It Is necessary, then, that the councils of our
party in this State shall be conducted' with de
liberation, with discretion, with wisdom .' and
yet with ze*U: find Jn t order- that that may: be
done It. is most important that' there "shall -be
placed as chairman of this convention a "mar.
in whose mental make-up all of those qualifi
cations are blended, 'and such 1 , a roan as that I
name as temporary chairman of this convention
In the person of Eldredge C. Farnsworth of
Visalia.
Ed E. Leake of Yolo, in seconding the
nomination of Judge Farnsworth, said:
It Is not my purpo6e at this time to discuss
any Issues or any candidates. The Issues are
already made, the candidates are already ,
named. We are here as a -ratification meet
ing. I arise, in behalf of Yolo County, to sec
Â«nd the nomination of Judge Â¦. Farnsworth. .He
Is a man of sterling and Irreproachable charac
ter, and a Democrat of long standing and State
reputation. It affords us great pleasure to sec
ond the nomination of Judge Farnsworth. (Ap
plause.) .j* . " , .'
Farnsworth. Elected.
Robert N. Fitzgerald of Alameda moved
that the nominations for temporary
chairman close. The motion prevailed.
Judge Farnsworth was promptly elected.
Frank Gould and Ed E. Leake were ap
pointed to escort Mr. Farnsworth to the
chair. Judge Farnsworth addressed the
convention as follows:
Gentlemen of the Convention: I thank you
for the honor you have conferred and I recog
nize it as a compliment to Tulare County,
which was in the last Presidential election the
banner Democratic county in this State. (Ap
plause.) We are on the threshold of the great
est political campaign this country has seen
for forty years. Grave political and economic
quwtions confront the people. The time has
come when the people will soon decide by their
votes whether this country will cut loose from
the teachings and traditions of its founders ,
and, 6wayed by the ideal of monarchy and em
pires, pursue a policy that belongs only to the
militant and imperialistic forms of govern
ment; a policy destined to fatten the already
gorged coffers of the favored few: a policy
destined to rivet the shackles of bondage on the
plain people and bend their backs to heavier
burdens and wreck the spirit of liberty that is
the genius of our institutions (applause), or
whether this country, true to the teachings and
traditions of Its founders, arising superior to
the doctrines and principles of monarchy and
Imperialism, which those now In control seek
to fasten upon it, will shake off this malign
influence and, continuing In the way marked
out by its sage and patriotic founders, be in
fact as well aa in theory a government deriv
ing It3 Just powers from the consent of the
governed and be forever as it should be, the
grandest, freest country on - earth. (Applause.)
Since the last Presidential election the Re
publican party has been In full control of all
departments of our government. What legisla
tion has that party enacted that has resulted
in benefit to the plain people of this country?
What good has It accomplished? What pledge
or promise of the platform of that party, adopt
ed at Its last national convention, has been

JAPANESE LEGATION
BURNED AT TIENTSIN
LONDON, June 14.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai says an unconfirmed re
port has reached there from Tientsin to
the effect that a foreign legation has been
burned and that a Minister has been
killed. The names, it is added, are with
held pending confirmation of the report.
It is further rumored that^ the interna
tional relief parties are experiencing great
difficulties in regard to provisions and
water. It is believed that the delay has
been caused by the fear that the force
was insufficient to overcome the opposi
tion that might be encountered and thus
precipitai Â» a massacre at the capital. It
is added i..at the Japanese have sent two
more cruisers and have landed 300 addi
tional troops.
A later report from Tientsin confirms
the news of the burning of the Japanese
legation, but the rumor that a Minister
has been killed is not confirmed.
Fifteen hundred Russians, with four
guns, have arrived outside of Peking-. This
makes 4000 Russians who have landed.
It is regarded as certain that the Japan
ese Government will take active steps
concerning the murder of the chancellor
of the Japanese legation.
In consequence of a disturbance at Che
foo, the German flagship and H. M. S.
Phoenix have returned there. A Russian
warship with 800 troops has gone to Han
kow.
Chinese desperadoes at Qulnsan, forty
miles from Shanghai, : have seized three
steam launches and treated the passen
gers plratically.
RUSSIANS SENDING ARTTLLERY
WASHINGTON, June 14.â The follow
ing cablegram has been received * from
Admiral Kempff: , â¢. :"
"TENG KU, June 14.â Secretary of
Navy. Washington: Twenty-five hun
dred men are on the road to Peking for
the relief of the legations; one hundred
are Americans; English and Russians
are in large majority; all nations here
represented. The Viceroy at Tientsin
gave permission to go there; railroad
being repaired as force advances. Rus
sians now sending soldiers from Port Ar
thur, with arth.^r/. KEMPFF."
TO RESTORE THE EMPEROR.
LONDON, June 14.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai dated to-day says: A re
port has reached here that the British,
American and Japanese Ministers In Pe
king favor the restoration of Emperor
Kwang Su, but that the French and Rus
sian Ministers Insist upon the powers tak
ing charge of China. It Is further re
ported that the respective divisions of the
country Have already been assigned. The
belief is that the withdrawal of the Brit
ish ships from th\; Yangtse-Kiang is an
indication of Great Britain's disclaimer in
the sphere theory.
MASSACRE OP ENGINEERS.
BRUSSELS, June 14.â Confirmation ha3
been received of the report of the mas
sacre of one Swiss and two Italian en
gineers employed on the Belgian Railway
in Northern China. The sister of the
Swiss engineer was also killed, and two
other persons are missing. The rest of the
French and Belgian engineers reached
Peking and Tientsin in safety.
The French-Belgian Company has 300
armed men guarding its main track,
which is still open for 100 miles.
MAY INFLICT A SHARP LESSON.
LONDON, June 14.â It has been learned
in official quarters that, although it Is
thought Peking will show no further re
sistance as soon as it perceives the pow
ers are determined, the commander-in
chief of the international forces has been
instructed to inilict a sharp lesson in the
event of any resistance, and not to brook
any delay in reopening the gates of Pe
king if he finds them closed.
RESIGNATIONS REPORTED.
TIENTSIN, June 13. â It is reported
that Prince Tuan, the new head of the
Chinese Foreign Office, and General Tung
Fuh Siang have. resigned.
Three more Russian warships have ar
rived at Taku.
SHANGHAI. June 14.â A dispatch from
Chung Klang says that a riot has taken
place at Yunan Fu. The buildings of the
China Inland Mission were partly de
stroyed, and those of the Roman Catho
lic and Bible Christian missions were ut
terly demolished. All missionaries are
safe.
A Russian troopship passed up tne
Yangtse Wednesday, June 13. It was re
ported that her troops were to be landed
at Hankow, but the Russian officials at
Shanghai explain that the transport has
merely gone to Hankow to load for
Odessa, and the troops on board are
time-expired men on their way home.
GUNBOATS ARE NEEDED -
IN NORTHERN CHINA
WASHINGTON, June 14.â John Ford,
secretary of the American Asiatic- Asso
ciation, to-day received the following
cablegram from the Shanghai branch of
the association:
"SHANGHAI. June 13.â Grave danger
threatens Americans in the Yangtse Val
ley. Urgently advise immediate gunboat
protection.
"AMERICAN ASSOCIATION." \
On the 7th inst. the following cablegram
was received from its Shanghai branch:
"American lives and Interests in North
China are seriously Imperiled. Urge gov
ernment to act promptly and vigorously
with adequate force."
The association, using these two cable
grams as a basis, Is circulating a petition
tor signatures, addressed to the President,
asking that the Government (take ener
getic stepa to protect American lives and
LONDON. June 14.-In the House of
Commons to-day the Parliamentary Sec
retary of the Foreign Office, William
St. John Broderick, made a statement
in regard to the position of affairs in the
Chinese empire.
"Her Majesty's Minister at Peking,"
said he, "has been In constant communi
cation with the Chinese Government
Hince the attack by Boxers on peaceable
converts, and' the destruction of three
villages about ninety miles from Peking
on May 12. On May 18 Sir Claude M.
Macdonald reminded the Chinese Foreign
Office of his increasing warnings during
the last six months of the danger of not
taking measures to suppress the Boxers,
and an imperial decree was subsequently
issued. On May 20 a meeting of the dip
lomatic corps was held at which a resolu
tion was unanimously adopted calling on
the Tsung-li Yamen to tatce more strin
gent measures. It was not then consid
ered necessary to bring the international
guards to Peking, but the British marine
guard at Tientsin, which had been under
orders to leave, was detained there and
two British ships were sent to Taku.
"As no specilic measures were taken by
Tsung-H \amen. to summon the guards,
met again May 26 and decided, failing the
receipt of a satisfactory reply from the
Tsung-lu Yamen to summon the guards.
This course was made May 2S, and a
British detachment of seventy-eight men
with a machine gun was forthwith sent
to Peking and 104 men were sent to Tien
tsin, while four more British ships were
brought to Taku.
"News was then received of the murder
of Mr. Robinson and the capture of Mr.
Norman, who was subsequently mur
dered. Sir Claude Macdonald continued
until June 5 to urgently impress the
Tsung-li Yamen with the necessity for
taking instant and effective steps to pun
ish the murderers and restore order, in
forming them that her Majesty's Gov
ernment held the Chinese Government
responsible for the criminal apathy which
had brought about this disgraceful state
of affairs. These remonstrances having
no effect, and the situation both at Pe
king and in its neighborhood becoming
more threatening, her Majesty's Govern
ment on June 6 telegraphed instructions
to Sir Ciaude Macdonald and Admiral
Seymour to take, in concert with the
other powers, any steps in their discre
tion which, if left unfettered, they might
consider advisable for the protection of
the foreign legations at Peking and
British subjects there, at Tientsin or in
the neighborhood.
"Sir Claude Macdonald, after a con
ference with the Russian representative
at Peking, was empowered to support
any Chinese authority capable of main
taining law and order or any measures
to this end. the Russian Minister being
similarly authorized.
"In consequence ot further depredations
of the Boxers Admiral Seymour called up
three more ships, and June 9, after con
sultation with the foreign commanders,
decided to land a force and march on
Peking. On June 10 he marched with
1078 men. of which 650 were British. This
force has since been increased to 2300
men, containing detachments from the
ship.s of seven of the powers. The ad
miral had advanced thirty miles on June
11 when he encountered the Boxers and
killed thirty-five of them. The railway
was much broken up and only three miles
were covered in the next twenty-four
hours.
"About 050 troops are being embnrked
at Hongkong, and the Terrible is going
to Taku. The Russians are landing an
additional detachment of 1700 men. Sir
Claude Macdonald reported June 11 that
disorders were occurring at Peking.
Nine British and twenty-five foreign
ships are now at Taku. and complete ac
cord prevails among the powers in re
gard to the action taken by Admiral
Seymour."
Mr. Broderick concluded with denying
he had the least intention of Implying
that Great Britain had any closer agree
ment with Russia than any other power.
MISSIONARY BUILDINGS
DESTROYED BY BOXERS
with the three mHes covered in the twen
ty-tour hours preceding the admiral's dis
patch, which Is dated yesterday, the in
ternational force was twenty-live miles
from Peking. There is every Indication,
however, that the twenty-five mile stretch
will be about the most difficult of the en
tire route. The dispatch of the admiral
makes no mention of further engagements
with the Boxers.
BRODER'CK EXPLAINS THE
ACTION OF GREAT BRITAIN
WASHINGTON. June 34.â A dispatch has
been received at the Berlin embassy here
from Admiral Seymour, In command of
the international troops now forcing their
way from Tientsin to Peking. The d!s-
Tiatch disclosed the extreme difficulties en
ro'-ntcred, mainly in the form of tracks
de"troved. and stated ttm the progress
was only three miles for the preceding
twenty-four hours. The commanding
felt that it would be desirable to
have additional force. In order to meet
nvery contingency, although the general
feoliru* was expressed that the trouble
wouM'bc'iPFS difficult to deal with than
tad been expected. It is calculated that
LONDON. Jure 13.â The Times publishes the following dispatch from Tientsin, via Shanghai, June 14:
"A serious ensagemc nt has occurred between the International column and the Mohammedan troops of General
Tung Ktj Siang near Peking."
Byron Bresnan. British Consul at Shanghai, who Is now in London, says that the Mohammedan troops are
arrr.ed with machine guns and repeating rifles.
A Shanghai dispatch dated yesterday says: "A Chinese steamer laden with arras and ammunition cleared' from
Shanghai to-day, bound for Tientsin. Ar.otorious murderer who was delivered by the municipality of Shanghai to the
Chinese authorities is being- slowly stoned to death in a cage. Thousands of spectators watch his agonies dally."
TIENTSIN, June 14. The Russians have landed four ,S-centimetre guns. These, with the 1700 men, will start on the
march for Peking to-morrow. A train filled with searchlights patrols the line between Tientsin and Taku.
The opinion is growing that the imperial troops will attack the international column near the capital, probably at
Feng Tai. General Tung Fu Siang- is in front and General Nieh in the rear of the guards. Ten thousand foreign-drilled
troops are still at Shang-hai.
LONDON*. June 15. 4:20 a. m.-Ob
servers at Shanghai and Tientsin
think there is a great deal more j
trouble ahead for the concert of i
powers than merely reaching Pe- j
king with 2>)0 men. Serious disturbances j
have taken place at Yung-Nan-Fu and j
iIer:gr-Tse. as well as other points at a !
considerable distance from the capital. Â«
The whole Chinese empire seems to be j
In a ferment. The intentions of the Em
press Dowager are etill equivocal, with a
balance of testimony on the side of a de
termination to expel the appropriatars of
a part of her country or to lose her dy
tasty la the attempt.
It Is related of her that on Monday fol- i
lowing the murder of the chancellor of
the Japanese legation she was aroused to
a. sense of danger and went personally to
the Tung-Tingr grate of Peking-, where she
advised, the rioters to disperse. But she
took no steps to apply force, and the ap
pearance of things is more, threatening
than before.
While Admiral Seymour, with the In
ternational relief column. Is forcing his
way to Peking, several of the power9 are
arranging largely to reinforce their de- |
tailF at Tientsin. Germany proposes send- j
inp I2U0 men. Great liritain sent COO from !
Hongkong yesterday and 400 will go Sun- j
day.
Italy has ordered 1000 to hold themselves
in readiness. Russia, according to a St.
Petersburg- dispatch of Wednesday, has
decided to bring her force at Tientsin up j
to GOJO. Thus the combined forces at Tien- |
tsin will probably soon, be about 10,000
men.
The explicit statement made yesterday
afternoon Jn the House of Commons by
the parliamentary secretary of the For- |
<;gn Office, Mr. Broderlck, with reference {
to the Identity of opinion among the pow
crs upon the question of an application of
force and the* method of applying- it. Is
accepted bv all the morning papers as
quite sufficient for the present and the <
bope is generally expressed that nothing
will happen to diminish the harmony. An
incident, however, has already occurred,
involving the British and French at Tien
tsin which nearly ended in violence. A j
dispatch from Tientsin, dated yesterday,
"For some days the French and Rus
sian authorities have been jealous because
of the eupposed facilities given to the
British authorities by the British em
ploves of the China railways. Yesterday j
< Wednesday) some French marines at
tempted to take charge of an engine re- I
Quired at the front. Locomotive Inspec- j
tor Weir refused to give up the engine
and a Frenchman attempted to bayonet
him. Weir caught the muzzle of the riflo
and the bayonet passed over his shoulder.
For a moment serious trouble between
the British and French was imminent, but
tho prompt action cf the British consular
and naval officers, backed by the Ameri
can Consul and the railway officials, pre
vented a collision. Conciliatory expres
sions were exchanged. The French Con
sul withdrew his opposition and the Brit
ish remained in charge of the engine as
before."
RELIEF COLUMN WITHIN
THIRTY MILES OF PEKING
BERLIX. June 14.â The Berlin papers
print a dispatch from Tientsin saying
t^at the internaaonal relief column has
arrived with thirty miles of Peking, but
that the distance remaining must be
traveled on foot, as the railway la com
pletely destroyed. This, the dispatch
â¢says, "will require two or three days.
Thus far the Gerinan squadron has
landed at Taku 27 officers and $50 men.
The Gorman troops at Kiaochau will be
increased on Jun^ 19 by the arrival of a
transport with 1400 soldiers. The trans
port originally had orders to relieve the
troops now servinpc there and to bring
tben back to Germany, but Emperor
William baa just issued an order direct
in? that the steamer be detained at Kiao
chau. This action is presumably taken
:n view of the situation at Peking, for.
em the Deutsche Kolonia Zeitung points
cut. trouble is not expected at Kiaochau.
Much concern is felt nere regarding
tho fate of the foreign diplomatists at
Peking. It Is feared, that they will be
unable to give emphatic expression to the
Chinese authorities cf the views of their
respective governments until a larger
military force arrives.
The harmonious action of the powers
plves satisfaction In press and Govern
ment circles, but the Deutsche Tages
Zeitung demands tuat Germany make
common cause with r'rance and Russia

late the latter and break ao & â Â«ier influ

DIFFICULT ADVANCE
OF THE FOREIGN TROOPS
Serious Engagement Occurs Between me Interna
tional Column ana Molmmmeflan Troops of
General Tung Fu Siang. Near Peking.
A new complication is added to the Chinese situation. Acting apparently
without the approval of other powers, Russia and Japan are sending additional
troops to Peking. Fifteen hundred Russians are, in fact, reported to be already
in front of the Chinese capital.
The international relief forces are within thirty miles of Peking, but must
proceed the remaining distance on foot, the railway being totally destroyed.
Communication behind them with Tientsin has been cut.
More disquieting stories come from the isolated capital. The Japanese le
gation is reported burned and a Minister killed. The latter part of the rumor is not
confirmed- Thirty thousand soldiers, it Is declared, have massed to fight the
hated foreigners, and one rumor adds that General Tung Fu . Siang will lead them.
CAI^L HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL,, * WASHIXGTON, June
14.â Russian and Japanese troops are now on their way to Peking. These
forces are supplementary to those landed by the naval squadrons at Taku,
and so far as known here are sent without preliminary approval of the var
ious powers. It is certain that the United- States has not been approached,
and it Is presumed here that Russia, determined to counterbalance the prepon
derating force of British marines, sent instructions to her troops to proceed from
Port Arthur. Upon being informed of the action of the St. Petersburg Govern
ment and of the murder of one of its official representatives at Peking, Japan
has decided that its interests demand that it shall be represented by a strong
military force, and it is the belief of diplomats and of officials that at least one
and perhaps three regiments, depending upon the number of troops sent by Rus
sia, would start for Peking.
It is the presumption of officials that the action of Russia and Japan Is due
to the absolute cutting off of all communication with Peking.
No advices were received from Minister Conger, and the only information
outside of that supplied by Secretary Hay, by diplomats who called upon him and
by friends of missionaries In this country received by the administration, was
the dispatch, dated yesterday, sent by Admiral Kempff stating that in addi
tion to the foreign troops on the way to Peking Russia was sending soldiers from
Port Arthur with artillery. ' . .
A copy of Admiral Kempff's dispatch was not transmitted to Secretary Hay.
After the authorities had considered it a statement was made that its contents
had caused no change in the determination not to dispatch troops from Luzon.
Only as a last resort will the President consent to order General MacArthur to
dispatch troops to Admiral Kempff's assistance. At the same time, missionaries
are strongly pressing the administration .to take such action, urging upon the
President the necessity of protecting Americans and their interests. In response
it has been pointed out that many of the missions are located in the interior, far
from tne sea coast, and that to reach them it would be necessary to send troops
through a country where they. would be continually harassed by Boxers, and a
large foroe would be necessary for this purpose. The missionaries probably fear
to leave their present location for the reason that the local authorities who know
Although Russia and Japan Are Sending Supplementary Forces to
the Chinese Capital, the United States Will Not Dispatch Troops
From Manila to Admiral Kempffs Assistance. ,
them are more willing to provide them with protection than would toe strange
officials through whose territory they would have to pass In order to reach the
coast.
That the French Government does not propose to permit its officials tolo9Â«
their lives is shown by the Information received here that all of the French
Consuls in Southern China have been ordered to abandon their posts and -pro
ceed $o Tonquln, which is French territory. 3J. Delcasse, the French Minister
for Foreign Affairs, stated several days ago that the necessary detachments
of troops would be sent Into Southern China for the protection of foreign life and
property.
In view of the dispatch of Japanese and Russian troops into China It Is ex
pected that Great Britain will send a military force to Taku. It was said to-day
in diplomatic quarters that Russia and Japan would send an equal number of
troops, but close inquiry failed to absolutely confirm tnis statement. It was added,
however, and this was confirmed in several quarters, that the powers are still
acting in concert. The grave danger of the landing of foreign troops lies in
their usual unwillingness to act under an officer belonging to a foreign detach
ment and of the possibility that their Governments will not withdraw them. A
diplomat pointed out to-day that the Japanese troops -will not like serving under
a Russian officer, and that Russians will probably dislike obeying- orders of an
English or Japanese officer. Furthermore, when the Russian troops are encamped
in Peking apprehension is expressed that they will never be withdrawn, but will
remain there on one pretext or another. This will certainly be objectionable to
Japan, which in any event Is very much wrought up over Russia's conduct In the
past. It is apparent, therefore, that the presence of the foreign military forces
adds a new and menacing complication to the situation.
Secretary Hay discussed the Chinese situation with representatives of the
various powers to-day. Secretary Hay Is yet unable to say whether the special
audience arranged on Saturday last -with the Empress Dowager has been held.
Though in diplomatic quarters the suggestion has been put forth that the powers
dethrone the Empress Dowager and restore Emperor Kwang Su, no official rep
resentation has been made to the Secretary on the subject, and the administra
tion does not contemplate adopting such a policy. This statement Is made on the
highest authority. ':/ :

Little Credence Placed in the Story,

a Ghastly "Sorrow
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. Cm June 14.â Interest In
the fate of the sealing schooner Pioneer,
which was last ppoken on October 4. 1S08,
and has long been given up for lost, has
been revived by the receipt of news that
the Siwashes of the west coast are cele
brating a sorrow dance for the tribesmen
who were aboard the ill-fated craft. The
news comes in a letter from a correspond
ent on the west coast.
The writer states that through some
means the Siwashes claims to have in
formation that the schooner had been
found a derelict, with her masts and rud
der gone. Grewsome features are added
to that tale in details, the Indians alleg
ing that the skeletons of all the crew
wero found aboard the floating hulk. Sl
waÂ«h stories are notoriously unreliable,
and little credence will be given the story
in conseouence.
It Is most improbable that the vessel
would float for the length of time the
Pioneer has been classed as missing. If
she 'did float she would almost certainly,
In such a period, have drifted across the
track of some steamer.
The Indians, however, are quite certain
that the relic of the seas has been recov
ered and are celebrating the event with
vim and energy. The women especially are
inflicting tortures upon themselves to sig
nify their sorrow and have scratched and
lacerated their faces and bodies until they
are In a terrible condition. The Siwashes
are 'too excited and their knowledge of
English is too limited to obtain anything
like a connected Idea of whence they have
derived their information.
The Pioneer, once known as the Path
finder, was last seen. in I'nimak Pass late
In October of 1S93. by one of the local
fleet, which, like the Pioneer, was then
heading homeward after the season's
hunting in the Bering Sea. The story of
her long delay, of the report of a terrible
storm by the schooners which left Un
alaska about the same time, of the anx
ious waiting of owners and friends of
those on board, and finally *of her being
posted as lost, are all familiar to those
interested in the craft which ply to and
from this port and to seamen generally.
The schooner was under the command
of Captain Lock, and in addition to Si
washes carried the following crew: Alex
McLean, steward; John Hlnes. W. Kar
rell of Esquimau and J. W. Smith of Shel

LONDON. June 14.â Mrs. Gladstone,
widow of William E. Gladstone,
died at 5:40- p. m. to-day. She had
been unconscious for about seventy
two hours, and died without re
covering consciousness.
The news was immediately conveyed to
the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the dean
of Westminster, the dean of Lincoln, Sir
William Vornon Hareourt, Sir Henry
Cainpbell-IJaimerman, Arthur J. Balfour
end others.
In the course of the evening William
Gladstone, heir to Hawarden, arrived
from Eton, shortly followed by two sis
ters from London. The bells of llawar
den Church rang muffled peals.
Ey courtesy of the dean of Westminster
and in accordance with arrangements
made In 1SC<9, the funeral will be held in
the abbey. The interment probably will
take place on June 19, being of as private
a character as possible.
Mrs. Gladstone was Lady Catherine
Glynne. daughter and heiress of Sir Ste
pbfn Glynne. who died when she was yet
a mere child.
In 1SC3 she married the rising young
statesman, William E. Gladstone, on the
same day that her sister married Lord
Lyttlrton, father of General the Hon. N.
G. Lyttltton. now commanding a division
cf General Buller's army in Natal, and
the double wedding was the occasion of
great rejoicing. In her long married* life
of near thrte score years she was always
th<v devoted companion of her illustrious
husband, and In her sphere was as "grand
an old woman" as he wus a "grand old
man."
She aided and assisted him In every pos-
Fible way in his own special work,. while
the carried out on her part the many
charitable and beneficent designs that
they together projected. One of the lirst
of these was the New Port Market Refuge,
FUgpested by Mr. Gladstone, to give tem
porarwy shelter and help to men out of
work and enable them to get employment
again. On the occasion of the great chol
era epidemic in London in 1SCG Mrs. Glad
stone took a house at CIapt<jn, filled it
with orphans left by the scourge and
wrote an appeal to the Times in thÂ«.-ir be
half that brought in S25J0M for their sup
port. About the same time she organized
the Convalescent Home at Woodford. in
Essex, and for twenty-five years visited
it twice a week, when in town, and going
to the London Hospital every Monday
morning to examine the claims of would
be patients. At the time of the great Lan
cashire cotton famine, near the close of
the American Civil War. she set on foot
another orphanage near their home at Ha
warden. This is still kept up and until
quite recently had no small snare of her
c-speciul supervision.
In a thousand and one ways the kindly
help and influence of Mrs. Gladstone were
used for the alleviation of misery and suf
fering and the betterment of mankind.
She was intensely earnest and practical,
but always governed in her work and
dealings with the unfortunate by an in
telligent Christian love.
Mrs. Gladstone Is the heroine of many
stories and anecdotes.
The following illustrates the devotion
and idealization in which she held her
statesman husband, as well as her kind
ness of heart and the peculiarities that so
long kept her name before the British
public:
Galdstone at one time had occasion to
address an open-air meeting whose tone
was decidedly unfriendly to himself. Even
the presence of Mrs. Gladstone at the
grand old man's side couH not silence the
hisses and catcalls until, as the sun began
to beat down fiercely on the speaker's bald
head, his wife's solicitude for his health
led her to rase a sun umbrella and stand
holding it over him. The sight of the
aged couple's devotion to each other
turned the tide of popular favor and the
air was rent by wild cheers for "the
grand old woman."
Mrs. Gladstone was affectionatelv re
ferred to (..â¢>â¢ her husband as "the" best
nurse in all England." She had almost a
mania for prescribing more or less nause
ous medicines for such of her friends as
w.-re ailing. James Russell Lowell, when
Minister to England, was slightly indis
posed while visiting the Gladstones. Mrs.
Gladstone forced on him a particularly
abominable black draught. He said after
ward :
"She gave it in such a sweet, motherly
way that the stuff tasted better than the
best cocktail."
A celebrated nrima donna once com
plained to Mrs. Gladstone:
"I am of no use in the world. I can't
help others."
"Y<s. you can." came the grand old
woman's reply: "you can love them."
A friend, calling on Mr.. Gladstone, in
troduced some topic of great political In
terest, adding piously:
"Only He who is above can guide our
land throuph the crisis."
To which Mrs. Gladstone replied In all
sincerity: "How clover of you to guess
that Mr. Gladstone was upstairs! He'll be
down in a moment."
The touching and heroic part played by
Mrs. Gladstone at the deathbed and fun
eral of her husband would make a grand
theme for the poet. England may well
mourn the loss of such a woman, as she
aid that of her life companion.
MRS EMA GETT OF SACRAMENTO. ELECTED PRESIDENT OF

THE LATE MRS. GLADSTONE AT HAWARDEN CASTLE IN 1S98.
PHILADELPHIA, Juno 14.â With all
work preliminary to- the entertain
ment of the â¢ National* Republican
Convention . and Its attendant
throngs practically accomplished.
Philadelphia Is now contentedly awaiting
her visitors. From the big convention hall
down to the smallest detail those charged
with the responsibility feel they have the
situation well in hand, and the complete
ness of THe preparations seems to justify
the belief. Aa yet. however, the hospi
tality of the city is "by no means taxed.
There have been very few arrivals to-day,
and the lobby crowds at the hotels are
composed principally of those persons in
terested In the contests with which the
National Committee Is wrestling on the
breezy tenth floor of the Hotel Walton.
The fakers, with badges, buttons and
souvenirs, made their appearance In scat
tering flights to-day, and decorations are
beginning to appear sporadically. The
great mass of delegates are, not expected
.to arrive until Saturday and Sunday.
Office-Holders Unseated.
The most Interesting event in the Na
tional Committee to-day was the seating
of the Warmouth delegates from Louisi
ana after a spirited contest, occupyipg
nearly all day. This is an overthrow for
the Federal office-holders of Louisiana,
ten of whom are on the delegation head
ed by Wimberley, Collector of the Port of
New Orleans.. Although Wimberley is a
member of the National Committee and
â¢made the strongest po&sible presentation
of the case, the committee, by a vote of
25 to IS, decided in favor of his opponent.
Among the men thus denied seats In the
convention is William Pitt Kellogg, form
erly United States Senator from Louisi
ana, who has been a delegate to every
Republican convention since 1SG0. War
mouth and his friends, who were success
ful to-day, represent the sugar-planting
interests of Louisiana, and the claim was
made before the National Committee that
recognition of this fac'ioh would make it
possible to elect three Republican mem
bers of Congress in the State.
The Delaware case is in abeyance, while
the sub-committee appointed yesterday Is
endeavoring to have the factions agree.
It is understood that the Dupont-Higgins
delegates insist upon nn absolute recogni
tion of their entire delegation, while the
Addicks men have shown a disposition to
make some concessions. Mr. Payne, who
is chairman of the sub-committee, says
the Delaware case may go over until Sun
day before final settlement.
Chairman Hanna is the center cf Inter
est and is much sought after for inter
views in the hope that he will give some
indication of his choice for the Vice Presi
dency. He is still non-committal, and
while he has been quoted in several papers
his statements are of a general character.
Senator Hanna has been seldom in the
committee room, and apparently avoids
taking part in the deliberations of the
committee so far as the contests are con
cerned. Mr. FeSsenden of Vermont pre
sided over the committee all day, even
during the brief periods when Senator
Hanna was present.
Vice Presidential Aspirants.
As to the Vice President, while It Is the
uppermost topic of discussion, members
of the committee and other leading Re
publicans here eeem to be still at sea.
Nearly every prominent Republican who
says anything about It remarks that "the
field Js still open and the best man will
win," which is taken to Indicate that no
one has been accepted by those who are
managing the affairs of the party. The
avowed candidates are Lieutenant Gov
ernor Woodruff of New York, who has
friends on the ground hustling for him;
Secretary Long, who was launched to-day
as a full-fledged candidate by the general
distribution of his picture on buttons la
beled, "For Vice President. John D.
Long," and Representative Dolliver of
Iowa, whose friends are urging him.be
cause of his reputation as an orator and
also for geographical reasons. According
to the present outlook besides the three
ramed there will be votes cast for a num
ber of favorite sons, though in many in
stances it will be purely a complimentary
vote Among these are Senator Fairbanks
of Indiana, ex-Senator Washburn of Min
nesota Governor Schofield of W isconsln.
Judge Bartlet Tripp of South Dakota and
Colonel Jay L. Torrey of Wyoming, while
the field is open for any others who may
be entered for the race.
Extensive preparations are making for
the" entertainment of the visitors. Each
Republican club in the city is to look after
the welfare of one or more of the visiting
clubs and nothing is being left undone to
make the stay of the guests a pleasant
one Banquets have been planned, excur
sions will be given to points on the Dela-
ware River and smokers without. number
are on the programme. â¢ ;--:â¢"
David C. Owen of Milwaukee, who has
been selected by Sergeant-at-Arms Wis
well to take charge of the minor officials
of the convention, to-day announced the
names of the assistant chief ushers. There
are about sixty of these officials and they
come from nearly every State in the
Union. Each one of the assistant chief
ushers will have charge of one section
and will have a force of from four to eight
assistants.
DELEGATES .MAKE MERRY
EN ROUTE TO PHILADELPHIA
Meeting Called by Vice Chairman
Pardee but No Business
Transacted. Â»
SpÂ«Â»c!al Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS. Nebr., June 14.â This
morning found the California delegation
train about four hours behind time. In
stead of being at Cheyenne to pick up
the dining car, the breakfast hour was
reached at Laramie. Here the delegation
had a taste of an old-time. eating houseâ
everything one don't want and nothing
one does. Just a soft boiled and a good
cup of coffee would have satisfied, but in
stead omelets, chops, steaks", pancakes
galore, all ruined in cooking. However,
it is a good natured crowd and they con
soled themselves with the longer the time
together the happier they will be.
To-day is Delegate George W. Reed's
birthday. It was duly celebrated this
morning In the old-style boyish fashion
of giving him an odd number of knocks.
Cheyenne was reached four hours later
and here the delegates procured the Den
ver papers, which told of Governor Game's
message to Secretary Hay about the
plague. That afforded conversation for
the morning.
Politics without the political pot boiling
Is no business. So if for no other reason
than for appearance' sake, Vice Chairman
George C. Pardee, at the request of sev
eral delegates, requested the secretary,
Edgar D. Peixotto. to call a meeting of
the delegates on the train for 3 in the
afternoon. Promptly at that hour all as
sembled in M. A. Gunst's drawing room.
Every one seemed glad to meet the other
in actual business. Alas, there was none.
All agreed that to transact any business
until all had an opportunity to be present
would be unpolitlc and unfair. It was
therefore formally resolved to do nothing
until reaching Philadelphia and then do
everything possible for the good of the
Republicans of California in particular
and of the United States in general. The
tide seems to steadily flow in favor of
Judge Van Fleet for National Committee
man.
At Grand Island, Nebr., the train made
quite a halt, long enough for the dele
gates to have a chat with many of the
populace who were at the station to wel
come and speed the travelers on their
way. From the cheering and what was
said to many of the delegates the assur
ance may be positively and absolutely
given that W. J. Bryan will not have the
unanimous vote of Nebraskaâ in fact, so
they say, he will not have the electoral
vote of his own State at all. And this is
nothing new.
The train is making mammoth strides
to gain lost time. Being behind does not
moan late far Philadelphia, only a shorter
time in Chicago, and some of the dele
gates are unkind enough to say they are
glad of that.

acterized Their Last State
Convention. "
LOUISVILLE, June 14.â Characterized
by harmony. In marked contrast with the
feeling that prevailed one year ago when
the Democrats of Kentucky met in Music
Hall to select a nominee for Governor,
was to-day's scene, the first since the
memorable light of 1899 in Music- Hall.
The object of to-day's convention was to
select delegates from the State at large to
the National Convention at Kansas City.
When Chairman A. Young of the State
Committee rapped for order and asked
for a nomination for temporary chairmaai
but one name was presented, that of Hon.*
Ollie M. James of Marion, and he was
elected bv acclamation.
Mr. James said he considered it an es
pecial honor to preside over a convention
of Democrats favorable to Bryan and to
Goebel. and who would abhor the
assassination of public officials for the
gratification of political and official
greed. Pointing to the picture of the de-
ceased Governor of Kentucky, which "was
suspended over the platform, Mr. James
said that, like . William Goebel, he had
rather be in the grave than be a fugitive
from justice like, the Republican. W. S.
Taylor. This brought, the delegates . to
their feet and they cheered long and lust
ily. Chairman James said that "the civil
liberty which the Republicans- of Ken
tucky are so earnestly advocating Is .the
right of the mountaineers to shoot down
with immunity Democratic office-holders
of the State." . Â¦
Governor Beckham addressed the con
vention, his remarks being of. a purely
local and personal nature. There wero
speeches by Congressman Wheeler, ex-
Congressman James B. McCreery - and
ot-hers. , The convention then adjourned
till 7:30 p. m.

and the repeal of the present tariff act;
condemns the imperialistic policy -of the

BOARD OF HEALTH PLANNING
TO THROW DOWN GAGE'S REPORT
Mr. Bennett followed Mr. Dunne and
read several affidavits to establish the
fact that bubonic plague had never exist
ed In the city. The first affidavit was that
of Wong Chung, who deposed that the
first case of death from suspected plague
wes;that of one Gfng. who, of the depon
ent's personal knowledge, had been sick
continuously for six months with the dis
ease of which he subsequently died. The
deponent further denied that any bac-
Not a Cass of Plague.
Power to determine questions of moral
ity, sanitation and public safety rested
with the legislative branch of the govern
ment, namely the Board of Supervisors,
and it was not for the Federal courts to
interfere, said the counsel, unless it should
be shown affirmatively that the laws or
the constitution of the United States had
been violated.
Mr. Campbell Interrupted the speaker by
remarking tnat his side had invoked the
Interference of the i ederal courts because
the treaty rights of Jew Ho had been
violated and the Federal courts were the
only tribunals having jurisdiction to In
terpose in that matter.
Mr. Dunne then went back to the weak
spot in his case, the fact that within the
rectangular boundary lines of the quaran
tined area there were the establishments
of a white plumber and an Italian wood
and coal dealer, which places of business
had been exempted from the operation
of the quarantine. On this point Mr.
Dunne argued that the coal deafer and the
plumber were situated outside of the
quarantined territory, even though the
Supervisors and the Board of Health had
chopped this small piece off the edge of
Chinatown.
On the question of discrimination ilr.
Dunne argued that the designation of a
certain quarter of the city within the
limits of which certain rignts and privi
leges of persons and property should be
restricted was not necessarily discrimina
tion. Courts had held that the State
might designate the limits within which
gunpowder or other explosives might be
stored or within which wooden buildings
might be erected. In the matter of quar
antine the speaker laid down as a propo
sition of law tha.t'tf all persons within the
quarantine limits were treated alike there
was no discrimination. It was no answer
to that proposition to say that a Chinese
laundry in the Mission had not been quar
antined. All the Chinese and other per
sons within those limits were treated
alike, and the charge of discrimination
could not be substantiated.
Mr. Dunne's argument was based upon
the assumption that thÂ»re was a plague In
Chinatown ar.d that there was urgent ne
cessity for the exercise of the arbitrary
police power of the municipality, the very
; proposition that was contested by the at
: torneyn on the other side.
Another point touched upon was that of
â¢ the alleged delegation of power by the
: Supervisors to the Board of Health, which
j Mr. Dunne cleverly evaded, taking the
ground that the Federal courts did not
j have Jurisdiction of that matter, because
> it was not contended that the alleged dele
gation of power was in conflict with the
i Taws or the constitution of the United
! States. In support of this argument Mr.
I Dunne quoted Supreme Justice Stephen
J. Field in the laundry case of Barbier vs.
Connolly, in which case Justice Field said:
"We can only consider whether the fourth
section of the ordinance is In conflict with
the constitution or laws of the United
State"."
Not Necessarily IHscrimination.
The argument in the Chinese quaran
tine care in the !_"ni?e-J States Circuit
Court closed and the case Â»a.s submitted
shortly before 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon, Judgi*? Morrow and De Haven being
on the bench. The court thereupon ad
journed until 11 o'clock this morning.
Judge Majrulre was absent. The attor
neys present for the Chinese were: J. C.
Campbell. 3. M. Shortridge. John E. Ben
nett. Robert Ferrali and Thomaa Keough.
The Board of Health was represented by
J. J. Dunne.
Mr. Dunne began his argument by quot
ing frcm authorities defining the extent of
the police power of the State and argued
that all the rights of property and per
sonal liberty guaranteed by the constitu
tion cf the L'nited States were subject to
the police power in cases cf urgent neces
sity for the protection of the public
against any danger, real or expected.
Taliir.gr this proposition for his ground
work, th- speaker proceeded to arg"uÂ«Â»,that
if the action of the Board of Health was
a lawful exercise of police power the court
should pay no attention to the pie* of per
sonal inconvenience or stoppage of busi
ness.

would be possible for the board to show
conclusively that the plague does exist in
Chinatown.
The germ theory of disease. Mr. Comp
bell proceeded, was at best a disputed
one. Many of the most eminent physi
cians in the world were of the opinion
that the germ theory had not been es
tablished by facts. Even the great Dr.
Sato, the first to announce to the world
the discovery of the bubonic germ, after
ward admitted in the public press that
he had been mistaken, that his descrip
tion of the grerm was incorrect, but that
he had found something else to be the
eerm. Attention was called to the cir
cumstance that net one of the members
of the Health Board had ever seen a
living person afflicts with the plague.
The speaker marveled that "these boys
who have been piaying with this flre are
none of them dead in their garrets of ln
-JeÂ«?ted rats and guinea pigs. It must be
because God takes care of children and
the other kind of people, and has per
formed a miracle In San Frandsco by so
ThÂ«*" speaker caused a titter whÂ«n he
mentioned the Health officers "hanging
over Chinatown like vultures over the
The exclusion from Chinatown of edu
cated and reputable physicians by a
resolution of the Health Board was
mentioned as showing the unfairness and
prejudice of that body. Mr. Campbell fur
ther argued the r.o:i-exi5tence of the
plague here by the fact that out of the
15 OOO to 23.000 Asiatics nuddled tog-ether In
filthy ill-ventilated, unsanitary quarters
In Chinatown there had been only eleven
deaths alleged from the plague In four
months He asserted that affidavits Hied
with the court showed, by the depositions
of competent physicians who had treated
the plague in India and China, that if the
eleven deaths had been due to the bubonic ;
plague Or&re would have been at the pres
ent time several hundred deaths and sev
eral thousand cases of the plague in |
Chinatown. This fact of Itself was suf
ficient to show that there had been no
reason whatever for the quarantine.
A Suspicious Circumstance.
On the question of unjust discrimination
Mr Campbell mentioned the Chinese Con
sulate, the white plumber and the white
coal-dealer as amons the persons residing
or doing business on the east side of
Stockton street who had been excluded
from the quarantine. It was a retnark
ablv auspicious circumstance, he added,
that in ever>" case of exclusion, with the
single exception of the Chinese Consul,
the persons excluded were other than
Chinese. Warming up to the subject, the
speaker said that if a Chinaman should
die in Chinatown frcm the plague the
Board of Health would be g-ullty of man
slaughter and should be punished, for the
board kept the Chinese exposed to infec
tion, if the cause of infection should hap
pen 'to exist there. . â¢
On another proposition" he charged the
health offldals with endeavoring to evade
the injunction heretofore issued by the
court against forcing Asiatics to submit
to an injection of HafTkine prophylactic,
and charged that Dr. "Williamson of the
Health Board had appeared before the
Six Companies and had threatened that
unless the Chinese submitted the board
would put the Chinese quarter under
quarantine,
Mr. Shortridge closed for the petitioner.
He spoke on the illegal delegation of
power by the Supervisors to the Board of
Health, and on the other issues Involved
tn the discussion. In the course of his re
marks he paid the folU^rtng well deserved
tribute to the Federal courts:
"I am glad that I stand in a Federal
court; I am proud that' I do, for I be
lieve that if it was not for that incor
ruptible branch -of the .government we
would not have to-day a republic to live
for to fight for and to die for. The Fed
eral court has never crushed a man. how
ever poor, hated or despised. It has never
turned away an apollcant for Justice,
however much he might be set upon and
hounded by irnoranee. prejudice or pas
sion. And this petitioner stands before
this tribunal of my country, trtiich we all
love, and he says. 'I. am here under the
sacred * honor and i protection of this re
public, and yotir Honors are not reaching
out to gra.op for power.*
"Wr>3? da you care for nower?" enn
tlnued Mr. Shortridira. "Indifferent alike
to censure or to praise. Indifferent to the
plaudits of the multitude or its execration,
you are here to do justice under your
catfcs. r.oi to be frightened by the sugges
tion that there has be* 1 n: here an attempt
to encroach upon the so-called powers of
thr IVard r-f Suoervlsor!Â» cr the Board of
Health of this municipality-" ~*
c\t the Board of He'** u Mr. Shortri(2?*Â»
Mr. Campbell next addressed the court,
beginning hts argument with a reply to
Mr. Dunne's contention that the Federal
courts could not interfere between the
police pewers of the State and the per
sons and property to be injuriously af
fected by thft^exercise thereof. He took
the ground that every ordinance or stat
ute baaed upon a pretense of the exer
cise of the police power should net be
considered a lawful creature of th!s
power. â¢
As to the Jurisdiction of the court. Mr.
Campbell cla'.med tbnt Jfrw Ho, a. subject
of the EinpfTor of Ch!na. and other per
sons bearing the same relation under the
treaty with China, were being uniawfully
discrimlnated against and In violation of
the rights guaranteed by the constitution
of the United States and of the treaties
between this Government and that cf the
Chinese empire.
The speaker proceeded to show that the
Supervisors had r.'.med at the Chinese
race alone, and that all Caucasians within
the quarantine Hn"? were exempted from
the oppressive rpfn;'.atlons of the quaran
tine. The Sapervfaori had acted in an
arbitrary manner by stating in the ob
jectionable ordinance that the quarantine
should be continued, not until all danger
of infection hadr pessed but "until th<*
further pleasure ot the board." a-limita
tion which Mr. Campbell denounced as
tyrannical, unauthorized ar.d Illegal.
The proposition was la!d down by the
speaker and reinforced by numerous au
thorities that while the Supervisors had
this extraordinary police power, they had
it only upon the circumstance and con
dition" that a contagious and infectious
disease existed within a certain pre
scribed district !n this city. All the evi
dence presented by the petitioner before
the court was that the bubonic plague
had never existed !n this city. All that
the experts of the Board of Health had
presented were affidavit? that they
thought that the plague existed in this
city. Besides that th^re was not a sinarle
averment on the ether s!<le that the five
medical members of the Board of Health
had ever graduated from a medical col
lege. With reference to Color.el Mendell.
one of the other members cf the Board
of Health, the speaker asked what prob
lem In Euclid- cr what textbook on trig
onometry ever taught Engineer ilendell
to take the square of the angle of a-bu
bonic germ. He asked als>o concerning
Chief of Police Sullivan, the "hero Â©f a
hundred parades In San Francisco." when
(I'd he brush away the smoke of the sham
battles of the League of the Cross Cadets
on the sand dunes to place the micro
scope to hi.Â« eye and say that plague
germs existed in San Francisco? It did
not appear on the face of the answer
that Dr. Kellogg or Dr. Klnyoun ever
had an hour's experience with the bu
bonic plague. f
A Wsjointed Theory.
Aimed at ths Chinese.
The next affidavit, that of Dr. Stephens,
of twenty years' practice in London. Lelp
sic and other European centers, set forth
that he was familiar with the symptoms,
nature and history of the bubonic plague,
and that if the ca?es reported; in China
town by the Health E^ard were those of
genuine plague hundreds, perhaps thou
sands, of the population of Chinatown
would be now dying or dead. The affiant
had examined several of the so-called
plague casts in this city and swore posi
tively that they were not cases cf the
bubonic plague or of any other plague, or
epidemic whatever.
The message of Governor Gage, pub
lished in yesterday's Issue of The Call,
was then read by Mr. Shortridge. and a
batch of other, similar affidavits were
handed up to the court.
The next affidavit was by George VT.
Cable. M. D.. a regular allopathic physl
sian. to the effect that in tuberculosis,
actinlmyeosis. scrofula and some other
diseases swelling of the . glands was a
common and symptom. The

|.\ 7HILE the people of San Francisco have been
\ wV/ engaged in the task oÂ£ putting such restric
tions upon advertising fences as will prevent
j them from continuing to be a public menace by rea
â¢ son of their excessive height, the people of the East
have advanced to a anther stage in the movement for
j the elimination of that form of nuisance, and, are now
j considering the advisability of subjecting it 'to taxa
'â¢ tion.
When the war revenue act was under consideration
â¢ by Congress some two years ago the New York
I Tribune advocated the taxation of poster advertising
\ on the ground that :he business is highly profitable
I and can wdl afford to bear its share bf public bur
.; dens. The same view has now been taken by the
] Outlook, which asks: "Ought not its share of the
' public burden to be put upon a business that from
â¢ its size is presumably so profitable, and that con
tributes so much to make life hideou^even in cases
vrhere its output cannot be called morally offensive?
j Why should a public necessity, like a bank check, pay
i a tax and the too familiar eyesore go free of tax?"
In commenting upon the support thus given to it>
I original suggestion the Tribune says: "Just at pres
' cr.t there is no need of new Federal imposts, but the
! posszbilSty of more strictly regulating billboards un
: der State or municipal authority is worth consider
; ing. We have laws here forbidding bills near parks
j and parkways, but they are not well enforced, any
1 more than are our laws for the protection of natural
I scenery from the sign-painting fiend. Public taste is
rot }*et educated to the point of securing enforcement
i of these laws, much less of adopting the Edinburgh
Â¦ plan of confining public advertising to specificl
Â¦ places where the ugliness of bills is least offensive.
! But we might take some steps to abate the unbridled
: exuberance of this most defacing and often debasing
; intrusion on public attention."
Taken in connection with the movement here to
j limit advertising fences to a height ne'e exceeding
â¢ ten feet, these expressions from the other side of the
continent are interesting as illustrations of the grow
: ing artistic taste of the American people and the in
! creasing disgust 2t offensive nuisances which in times
i past have been freely tolerated in public places.
i Slowly the laws cf our municipalities tend to the es
i tabHshnient of a better order of things, and by and by
j we shall have cities whose principal thoroughfares at
j least are free from anything that offends the eyes and
; the minds of cultured people.

Senator Perkins Says Estee Was He-
Kin ley's Choice for Ha-sraiian
Judgeship.
OAKLAND, June 14.â United States
Senator Gecrg* C. Perklr.s a.-.d Cor.jrres's
man Victor H. MÂ«tca!f have returned
from Washington to their homes in this
city. Senator Perkins arrived this isorn
ir.g ar.d Congressman Metcalf arrived
Tuesday night. Both the Senator and the
Representative agree that the last session
of CcEgress was one of the most impor
tant In the history of the country, for it
had many raatterg to disuse of as the re
sult ot the Spanish-American war.
As to Judge Greene and the Hawaiian
Judgeship, Senator Perkins said:
"I Indorsed Judre Greene as aa able
Jurist and an honest man. and I Lave
never taken thathack ar.d never win. Ks
to the Hawaiian Jadff*hlp. that was jet
tied when Professor Moses wa? given the
Philippine Commission. President McKItj
ley desired to do something for Mr. Estee
and th* Hawaiian Judjreship was all that
was left. If the appointment had not
gone to Mr. Estee It would have gone to
son* other State. If Judge Greene fcaa
made any attacks upon me It Is not the
first time that I have had s-ch r&cks
thrown at me."
The return of Cor.rressraan Victor H.
Metcalf to Oakland has airalcened poMti
cal interest more than anything else. Mr
Metcalf will now look after his caznpa:ra
for CongTess.
"I hare nothing: to say politically." said
Mr. Metcalf. "As to the worfc of Con
gress, that has been told by the daJlv pa
pers. The California delegation in Cos
press wielded great influence, and the Im
portance of California In Washirston is
grrowin? with the develorment of trade
and affairs on the Pacific Coast. The ope
rations of the Government ca tha Pa
ciSc have made California tha center ot

SENATOR PERKINS DCELARES
MeKINLEY'S RE-ELECTION SURE
Scott Would Be Good
Running Mateâ
Dewey May Help
Out Bryan.
Â«ro? S public sentiment now stands. It
//\\ Is almost certain that the Presl
k "U dentlal election will result In a vic
tory for McKinley. Though the op
posite party has been making strenuous
efforts and done mcch good work. It is
hard to see how they can enake the sta
bility of the present administration, the
beneficial effects of wfclch are to bÂ« seen
on all sides: such at least is toe opinion
in Washington. I believe that the body of
voters the United State* over share xhla
conviction."
In these words Senator Perkins, who has
just returned from Washington, Bums up
the present indications of the outcome of
the Presidential contest.
"While tee nominations of McKinley and
Bryan as opponents for the Presidential
office are foregone conclusions." continued
the Senator, "the choice or running mates
is by no means so certain an affair. The
late war has, of cours*. increased tee
prestige of a naval or military man, and
I am inclined to think that the Demo
cratic party will nominate Dewey for the
Vice Presidential office. It Is an open se
cret that he. if offered the nomination,
would accept it. There can exist no doubt
that his name would lend strength to
the Democratic ticket. There is through
out the Eaet a very strong undercurrent
of feeling for the admiral, and though
this may have been weakened by the
events of the past few months, it still ex
ists. Then there 1? Hearst. 1 understand
that he is making a try for the nomina
tion. I think he stands some chance.
Scott for Vice President.
"On the Republican ticket the struggle,
I think, lies between four menâCongress
man Dolliver. Senator Fairbanks. Secre
tary of the Navy Long and Irving M.
Scott. The latter I should be inclined to
pick for a winner. He would be in every
respect the man for the place.
"1 don't see how the issue some Demo
crats are making ot the attitude of the
administration toward the South African
situation can affect the result. This coun
try surely has trouble enough of her own
without picking a quarrel with England.
I myself svmpathize heartily witn the
struggling patriots, but the attitude the
administration adopted was the only one
right and possible under existing circum
stances. The real issue of the coming
campaign will be 'can we or can we not
afford to adopt a change of administra
tion and thereby upset the whole course
of things?" Everything is at present run
ning smoothly. Those who want, work
have no difficulty in finding it and at fair
was^s. There is every prospect of our
dependencies being speedily brought to the
*ta?e where their usefulness to the na
tion will commence. A change of admin
istration naturaily means a change of the
whole political life of the nation. A
change in political life must of necesslty
react with an unhealthy effect on busi
ness and would In all probability give the
nation a setback from which it might be
years before she would recover. Of course
there are malcontents, but lay your nnger
directly on the pulse of the nation and
you wi'il nnd it beats for another term of
McKinley."
California's Part in Congress.
As regards the part California has
played in the first session of the fifty
sixth Congress, the Senator had the fol
lowing to say:
"The session of Congress just terminat
ed has oeen a busy one. A large number
of Important bills has been presented.
Many of them have passed. A greater
numoer have: In fact, been passed than in
any -recent Congress. In all these meas
ures the California delegation has taken
an active interest. Their work and the
position maintained by them demonstrates
the breadth of view of members who have
the Interests of the entire country in view
as well as those of our particular State.
The legislation in the interest of Califor
nia has been very considerable. It 13 the
direct result of the manner in which all
the members of the delegation worked to
gether. Whatever measures were good
For, our State received the hearty Indorse
ment and support of every nr.e. The re
suit is gratifying to them. It will be. I
am sure, eratlfylng to the people. The
part the delegation has played demon
strates clearly the efficacy of the policy
of pulling togetherâ a policy which other
States have found to lend much strength
to their cause and to gain them many ad
vantages.
Legislation Under Way.
"Among the importat bills on which one
or the other of the two houses has taken
favorable action, and which -will come up
for final disposition next winter are these:
"The Nicaragua canal) bill passed by the
House and made the special order in the
THE KfllSER flhD HIS NflVY.
l~) ERLIN dispatches announce that the Bundes
\\ rath has approved the navy bill and the meas
ures devised by the Government for carrying
out the plans of the proposed increase of naval ar
mament- It is added that when informed of the fact
the Kaiser exclaimed: "Now we know where we
c tand. \x last there is solid bottom under one's
It will be remembered that in a "recent speech on
the subject the Kaiser stated that unless the desired
increase of the navy were authorized it would be im
possible for him to promote the expansion of the em
pire and its commerce in the manner he desires. The
speech gave no intimation of the nature of the im
perial desires, or the direction in which he would un
dertake expansion. There were some who said he
wishes a larger share of Africa, others asserted he
would enter upon a general spoliation of China and
take a portion of that empire for Germany, while a
third set of prophets predicted that his "energies
would be .directed to this hemisphere â that- he would
seek a coaling station and perhaps more in the West
Indies, and room to found a German colony in South
America. Since the increased naval strength is now
tc be given to him, we may learn ere long which of
the three forecasts most accurately estimated his in
tentions.
Of course the Kaiser will not have a free hand all
at once. It takes time to construct warships. It is
evident, however, from the expressions reported that
the Kaiser already feels stronger than in the past.
He has overcome the opposition to his will in Ger
many, and that is a matter of no small moment He
knows where he stands. The empire is with him in
his schemes of imperial aggrandizement, and he can
act with more boldness than he could assume when
the opposition seemed strong enough to thwart his
plans. Germany is to be counted hereafter as an ex
panding empire, and Russia, Great Britain and the
"United States will hive to reckon with her on that
basis.
The Chinese crisis will keep the Kaiser busy for a
while, but it is not likely he will be permitted to at
tain anything in the way of territory from it. The
balance of power is too close at present for either
party to risk much, and even should the Kaiser and
the Czar agree upon a plan of partitioning China.
they would hardly venture upon it at this time.
There is a better field for immediate activity in
Africa. In the division of that continent Germany
received but an inadequate share. She came late to
the spoiling and had to take what the other powers
left. Now that Great Britain is involved in war with
the Boers, and France is scheming the annexation of
Morocco, it may be possible for the Kaiser, to in
crease the sphere of German influence in that con
tinent and materially add to the extent of German
possessions.
The reported intention of the. Kaiser to obtain one
or more of the West India Islands from Denmark,
and to get a portion of the South American conti
nent under German control, can hardly be well
founded. After the summary manner in which the
United States warned Great Britain not to venture
upon a war for aggrandizement in Venezuela, and
forced the British to submit their claims upon the
Venezuelans to arbitration, it is hardly to be sup
posed any other power will venture to violate the
Monroe doctrine. Taking all things into.considera
tion, therefore. Africa appears the best field for the
exercise of any expansiveness the Kaiser may feel,
but even in that quarter enterprise is risky, and
since the Kaiser knows where he stands just noM(.
it will be well for him to stand 'there a while and
not move too rashly. t
Of the two newly elected- United States Senators
from Louisiana one is said to be a gold standard man
and the other is in favor of annexing the Philippines,
yet both call themselves Democrats, and both are
going to support Bryan. That is a sample of the way
politics goes in the far South.
Bryan says his platform is to be 16 to 1, anti
trust and â¢ anti-imperialism, but as â¢ the South'* is â¢ in
favor of imperialism, Tammany in favor, of trusts and
nobody in favor of free silver outside the* silver
States, the proposed platform can hardly be said to
fit the situation.
Kaiser William is to have his new warships, and
before long he will be proclaiming himself as "war
lord of the high seis." and "Rule, Germaniai" will
make the band beat in Berlin. y

It is therefore clear the Republicans are not to
j have a walkover. The excellent administration Mc
! Kinley has given the country, the widespread pros
] perity resulting from the Republican policies* of
j protection and sound money, and the natural re-
I pugnance conservative citizens have at the thought
1 of the election of an agitator like Bryan to the
' Presidency, will of course tend to assure Republican
i success: but potent as such factors are. it will not be
i safe to trust to them only. There must be organiza
} tion and earnest work. By the display in this cam
! paign vi an activity equal to that of 1806 we shall
j achieve such a victory. as will eradicate Bryanism
fiom our politics forever.
; The so-called "divine healer" of this city who is
j accused of making love to his landlady, pulling, her
j hair when she toughed at him, and then taking ad
j vantage of her absence to sell her piano and a bed-
I stead, and skip out. iÂ« certainly a record-breaker in
J his. way, but he cannot last long at that rate. The
J divinity in him will shape his end rough.
The tri2:ng fact that in South Carolina there is a
. . Alt J
Rej ublican majority. 2s there :; m Alabama and
Mississippi- has nothing to do with the case. In his
speech in the Senate, see Congressional Record.
Fiftv-sixth Congress, first session, pages 2J47-49,
Senator Tilkr.ari explained how general elections
ccm? to be merely 3 ratification of the will of the
Democratic bosses. After admitting that there was
a Republican majority in South Carolina, he frankly
enclosed the methods by which it was overcome; he
ssid: "We took the government away. We stuffed
ballot-boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed
of it. With that system, force, fraud and tissue bal
lots, we got tired ourselves. So we called a consti
tutional convention 2nd eliminated the colored vote/"
They went further than that, they have erected
such an oligarchy that white men dare not stand up
against It. The moral perversion besrotten in using
murder, fraud, force and tissue ballots against the
rezroe c . has made them equally :nto:erant 01 white
opposition. So it has come to pass that only one
partv is permitted in the South and its will is regb
tered. as a perfunctory matter, at the ballot-box. Tnis
spirit controls the party. In its presence all opposi
tion to Bryan b driven by fear into silence and in
activity. A party whose leaders, the men who are to
guide Bryan's administration if he is e'ected. declare
in the Federal Senate that they gained power by
murder and are not ashamed of it, if it get Federal
pov.-er will not let it go if it can be retained by the
crimes of which they boast.
Almost anything in government may be preferred
to the rule of an oligarchy which tolerates no oppo
sition, and reaches its ends bv murder when nothing
else will ga:n them.
REPUBLICAN ACTIVITY.
/^\NE of the gratifying features of the political
{ J situation is the alertness of the Republican
â leaders in preparing for the campaign notwith
standing the fact that every prospect promises an
e2sy victory. It is evident the party managers do not
intend to permit their sanguine expectations to lead
them to underrate the iorces ot the opposition, or to
commit the blunder of entering the contest unpre-
There are indeed many reasons why the party
should be as active and as well organized in this cam
paign as in any that has preceded it It is true the
vote of Oregon shows that the fusion forces in that
State are not so strong this year as they were in 1896,
and a corresponding weakening of their strength may
be inferred to have taken place throughout the Pa
cific Coast and the whole of the Greater West; but,
on the other hand, there is a possibility that Bryan
has gained something in the East, and that possibility
has to be taken into account as one of the factors of
the contest. \
Just before the adjournment of Congress the Wash
ington correspondent of the New York Herald, after
a thorough study of the actions and the words of the
Democratic representatives at the capital, came to the
conclusion that earnest efforts will be made to bring
the conservatives back to the party sf possible. Com
menting upon the course likely to be pursued at the
Kansas City convention he said: "Those who ex
pect delegations to go to that convention with clubs
in their hands or threats of bolting if their views arc
not accepted are going to be deceived. The experience
of 1806 has settled all that. While on the one hand
there will be no thought of bolting in the minds of the
Eastern Democrat?, on the other hand there will be
fpcr.d amontr the Southern and Western menâ on all
sides, in fact â an earnest desire to make things easy
Â£nd pleasant for those who have been out of har
mony with the party, in so far as this can be done
without any abandonment of principle."
Of course the abler and more intelligent gold
Democrats will not be won over by any soft words
that may be put into the platform. The very fact that
Bryan is renominated will warn them of the folly of
trusting to the specious promises the platform may
make. Nevertheless there is danger that some 01
the less resolute of those who refused to vote for
Bryan in 1806 may vote for him now. Such astute
leaders as Hill and Gorman are in this fight for their
lives, and that they will have skill enough to catch
some eudzeons is not to be doubted.
| I THEN, under republican forms, only one po-
I \\f titscal party Is permitted to vote, there Is *
Z failure in republican government, cad an im
perial oll^zrckj appears. Colonel Bryan has uttered
ail the changes in his weO worn gamut about the
dangers of imperialism frosi continued supremacy of
the Republican party, and nowhere has he been more
impassioned in wooing the Goddess of Liberty than
â¢a his campaigns in the Southern St2tes. His hope
of "election is" the- solid South, and he has striven to
keep it solid by carrying around as a stage property
a "grave of liberty, over which he weeps briny
words of sorrow.
If this mourning aspirant tor tee rrencency wooiG
look closer he would find imperialism already in ac
tion in the very section where he cries out the loud
Â«t ag2:nst it
A Northern paper having commented on the small
Â¦vote cast in the South, the "State," a Bryan organ,
* peb'ished :n Columbia. South Carolina, hastens to
explain why so few people vote in that section. It
scys: "Possibly, through excusable ignorance of the
facts, the small vote cast at general elections in the
Sorth is misconstrued. The reason why only a snoali
part of the whites themselves are interested enough
to go to the polls is that all contests for ofnee are
Â£Â«tled within the Democratic party before the gen
eral election?, and inasmuch as the great majority of
qualified voters choose to afnliate with that party, the
gtneral elections are merely perfunctory and formal
comp'iance with the law. In South Carolina, for
ex--.mple. # a!l ofneers. with few exceptions, from
United States Senator to Coroner, are selected by z
Democratic primary- s"d a? general election is prac
tirclly only a ratification of these selections."

and. as I said, wse of the leading J>emo

working under the order and the instruc
tions c-i this body. I had a talk with
Senator White and I was requested by
that committee to come here and tell you
that they could not report until 5
o'clock, and Senator WTiite expressed
his deliberate opinion that the selection
of a Central Committee at this time and
by thiF conrenjon -would be illegal; that
the Central '>xir. i :;>* fo se!*-<-ted would
have th* p^wÂ«-r and the right under the

if we are here for any purpose. If we '
? xpect to carry the State of California
for William J. Bryan in November, we

Let "5 He sure: let us avoid any entan

Mr. Patton of Los Ar.geles â Mr. Chair
man and pentletnen of the convention: It
la new tfn minutes after 4 o'clock. The
r^i-^-ss which has been, requested will take
less than one hour. As Mr. Storke has
well said, haste at this tlra*> might not
only *Â¦-* dar.yerous. but in the end It might
Ve disastrous. It is certainly the desire
cf this convention that In this proceeding
Â¦sv<r Fhall act legally. Suppose that after
the nomination by an illegal convention
cf Presidential electors by our action to
save forty or fifty minutes' time here thi.*
evening we should imperil the election oi
Wtniaih J. Bryan and cast the decision
cf that question into a Republican court.
Gentiezoea, I do not thir.k that there can
be crjy question that this motion at this
time for a recess should prevail and 1
therefore move, if Mr. Storke will per
mit it. and if it it of parliamentary pro
ir:e:y. that he will withdraw it for a
moment while I move that that report be
laid upon the table to be taken up af:tr
the rec<>>.
Jodpe Storke â I will allow that. I will
Â¦withdraw it and second your motion.

as a rsember o* that committee â I only

ful'y west over the ground.* of objection
tr.ade bv Senator White: that the same
objection was made by Senator White thai
Â¦was made also by Mr. Majruire and Mr.

the opir.Jon cf Mr. Maguire and Mr.
y.~:. sorter careful consideration, that
the jcrsis of the result, providing that this
committee take It* office only after the
l^th day of Juiv would obviate every pos
sibility of legal complication of any char
ac*er whatever. I can conceive of no
possibility under the law whereby thp ac
tion cf this convention could jeopard:zÂ«Â»
the Interests of the party in appointing a
committee to tr.k* office at this time in
a*rnueh as every act required to be dene
fcy the St&tr- Central Committee of the

Call* of "Question: Question:"
A delegateâ I rise to a po:nt of Informa
tion. Why this undue haste? Let him
frive some reason for thia undue haste.
Mr Gouldâ I did not Fuppose there was
â¢ciy "undue haste. I had supposed that
â¢ acb of the members of the convention
wan laborir.g under the ss.rne feeling that
i am ar.d that they wanted to get tarougn
rvi'h their work and go home.
A roiceâ Oh. no.
Mr Gould-Ar.d that. If it Is net nere?
--rsrv to delay us here, if we can sa oa and
iZ'f-cn*s the appointment of the Stat~ C<>n-
I'aJ Committee at this time and in the

A delegateâ I for one would like to hear

Mr Firxgerald â I would like to ask of
Mr. <5ould if he has considered the ques
tion whether the next convention, which
must meet in August, has not the right
W appoint a State Central Committee.
Mr Gouldâ I think that every ort* will

it eers fit. can elect a State Central Com

MENTO. June 14.â The convention was

Th* Chairmanâ The next ord^r ot busi
r.e^s is the consideration of thÂ«> report of
the committee on organization.
W. H. Alford of San Frar.ciscoâ Mr.
Chairman. I beg leave to report that the
committee on platform and resolutions is
at the present time ready to report, and I
movie that the report of that committee
be taken up at this time out of order and
presented to this convention. It will take
a very few minutes to do it.
Our Interest in Philippines.
Motion seconded and carried.
W. H. Alfordâ Mr. Chairman ar.d gentle
men of the convention. 1 feel that it is ray
duT to say at this time, on behalf of the
committee as well as on behalf of the con
vention, that the committee that you ap
i pointed has labored a!most ever since we
! adjourned in the preparation of this re
port. I would say that -we found it more
difficult to prepare a short report than we
would have found to prepare a long one,
and we have brought In the report at the
earliest possible moment. The committee
begs leave to report *s follows. Mr. Al
ford then read the platform, which was
frequently applauded. -
Senator Whiteâ Mr. Chairman. 1 move
the adoption of the rep-.-rt of the commit
tee as read.
J. Marion Brooksâ Mr. Chairman. I have
an amendment to the report.
The Chairmanâ The question is on the
adoption of the amendment.
Mr. Brooks-Mr. Chairman and gentle
men of the convention
A delegateâ Mr. Chairman. I rise to a
point of order. There has been no second.
Mr. Br>>oksâ We don't need a second to
a resolution. Mr. Chairman and gentle
men of the convention: I have presented
thi? resolution a? a part of the platform.
If therÂ»- is any State in this Union that Is
interested in the Philippine Islands the
great State of California is one. The
Democratic party has been for ten years
advocating the freedom of Cuba. We do
rot advocate here the suppression of the
people in the Philippine^, but these Islands
come to us as the result of war; not as
the result of a Christian war, because
thr-re Is no Christianity in war and in
[ murder. But these islands come to us by
I a solemn treaty â that treaty that pledged
every citizen in the Philippine Islands
that we would protect them and their
interests. We have solicited the support
of the natives of that country, and to-day
we have 4 ( *Â» natives lighting under the
flag of our country*- I say we would be
recreant to our duty, we would be re
"creant to the interests of our party if we
should draw down that flag from that
country and leave those men at the mercy
of the" Bolo men.
The ayes and noes were called for and
the amendment was rejected.
The Chairman â The question now Is on
th<Â» adoption of the report of the com
rnitteÂ«.
A. Caminetti of Amador â Mr. Chairman,
in the Chinese resolution the word "exten
sion" is used. When the committee were
acting upon that matter they Â¦ used the
words "re-enactment and lmi*Dvement
of." ard I move that the report' be cor
rÂ«-cte-d by striking out the word â¢'exten
sion." T/hich means nothing under the cir
cumstances, and insert in lieu thereof the
words "re-enactment and improvement
of." in accordance with the action of the
committee.
Mr. Alfordâ I think that is correct, lly
memory of it is to that effect and I think
it should be corrected as suggested.
The motion to correct the report was
carried and the report of the committee
was adopted.
A Delegateâ I have a resolution that I
desire to offer to this convention.
The Chairman â LTnder the rule which
has be^n laid down the resolution will be
referred to the committee on resolutions
without debate.
The Delegateâ Mr. Chairman, upon that
point, that resolution has lvÂ»en referred to
a sub-committee and then to the commit
tee on resolutions and platform, of which
I happen to be a member, and now the
resolution comes to this convention for
consideration.
The Chairman â It doe* not. The chair
has ruled that it goes back to the com
mittee. That is the ruling of the chair.
Is th*>re anything' further before this con
vention at this time?
T. A. BeU of Napaâ Mr. Chairman, u a
Mr. Gouldâ As I understand it the report
of the committee of which Mr. Sims is
chairman was postponed until the report
of the committee on platform was re
calved. I presume that Is in order at this
tim<>.
Th* Chairmanâ That is in crder at this
tirre.
Mr. Gouldâ I move the adoption of the
report.
J. J. Well? â Mr. Chairman. I move to
amend that report by striking out . the
words, "the appointment of twenty mem
bers at large."' and to insert in lieu there
of the words, "twenty-one to be appoint
ed three frcm each Congre*sional dis
trict."
The chairmanâ The question is on the
adaption of the amendment.
W. H. Alfordâ Mr. Chairman, there is
no reason for adopting thi* amendment. If
this amendment is to be> adopted the mat
tpr mJcht as well b* referred, and better
be xeferred. to the Congressional districts
themselves. The object of allowing the
chairman to appoint twen.'y Is that the
chairman may pick out from any portion
cf tfce State an active working body that
will take an active interest constantly In
this campaign. That Is the reason for
empowering the chairman to appoint, the
rnlv valid reason that can be urged In Its
favor, and this matter of compelling the
chairman to select them from Con
crVssirmal district!- is Fimply to make him
refer rnern back to the districts, and it
might a? well In left to the districts them
<- 'vâ¬* find the chairman net appoint any
todr* Therefore I can see no reason for
charging the report.

Mr. Reunisnn of Montereyâ The matter
cf the election of a State Central Com

on platform and resolutions reports. When
we adopfd the report of the committee
on permanent organization and order of
business we adopted It with the exception
of the last section, which referred to the
rloction of a State Centra! Committee,
and that ought to go over until the com
mittee en resolutions shall report. This

another report on organization. Are there
two committees on the same organization

if the matter of the election of a State

A delegate from San Franciscoâ I will

has already ?ald. We had disposed of this
question upon the repon of the committee
on organization and ord^r of badness, and
we deci<1<c-d that if there was any dispute

must lay over and vou must adjourn.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, June U.â Much to the surprise o?
the delegates themselves, the exciting
scenes that were promised In the Congres
sional district conventions did not come to
pass. This wa? due in pan to the fact
that many candidates withdrew from the
field rather than suffer defeat of their
aspirations. Only in two districts was It
necessary to resort to a roll call to decide
the choice of delegates.
First District.
After J. F. Farraher of Yreka and J.
Emmet HaydÂ»n had been elected chair
man and secretary of the First Con
gressional District, the election of dele
gates was at once proceeded with. C. O.
Dunbar of Sonoma placed J. 3. Sweet of
Santa Rosa in nomination, and
Francis Carr followed and In a
short speech placed Senator" C.
F. Foster of Tehema before the conven
tion. Nominations closed and both gentle
men were elected delegates by acclama
tion. M F. Corcoran of Martn and J. L..
White of Uklah were elected alternates.
M. F. Corcoran and F. R. Welhe were
elected State Central Committeemen.
Second District.
Major A. F. Jones of Oroville called the
Second Congressional District to order. E.
I. Woodman of Sacramento was unan
imously selected chairman and Gus G.
Grant of Stockton and John CofTman of
Nevada County secretaries. John M.
Woods of Stockton was placed In nom
ination by Henry Jacobs of San Joaquln,
and D W- Carinichael of Sacramento was
named by Judge J. W. Hughes of this
city. Both candidates were called before
the convention and pledged their faith in
the Democratic standard-bearer. They
were elected by acclamation. *A. 'I. Me-
Sorley of Calaveras and Samuel Butler of
Nevada County were elected alternates. :,
Third District.
C W. Thomas presented the name of D.
H- Arnold of Colusa for chairman of the
Third Congressional District Convention,
and Edward E. Leake of Woodland nom
inated C. W. Thomas of Yolo for secre
tary Both gentlemen were elected and
an adjournment was then taken until the
main convention perfected , organization.
Upon reconvening a few hours later, elec
tion of delegates and alternates was taken
up E J. Ryan of Humboldt nominated
James A. Keys: Seth Millington of Glenn
named Frank Freeman of his county; D.
H Arnold surrendered the chair to Ed
ward E. LeaVe long enough to place the
name of H. H. Seaton of Colusa before
the convention: J. J- McDonald of Ala
meda County nominated It., M. Fitzger
ald of that county. Fitzgerald declined
the nomination. A ballot was then taken
and It resulted In the following vote:
Keys, 90; -Freeman. 45: Seaton. 3S. The
first' two were then made the unanimous
choice of. the convention and Mr. Seaton
Senator Jones of Butte moved that the
nominations be declared closed. This
motion was seconded and carried.
Chosen by Acclamation.
Balloting was Immediately begun. When
Teharna County was called D. A. Ostrom
went to the platform and in a brief manly
speech withdrew from the contest. Bal
loting then ceased and on motion of Dele
gate Allender of Los Angeles, the election
of White, Ma^uire. Tarpey and Phelan
was declared by acclamation.
When the result was announced the
winning candidates were called to the
platform. They delivered stirring
speeches, which called out volleys of ap
plause. Ex-Senator White spoke as fol
lows:
Mr. Chairnjin: The h??ur Is too late and
your occupation is too onerous to Justify m ;L"*

election of delegate to Kansas City, it is true,

his previous views may have been, who would

Fellow-ci:izens, Democrat", delegates, remem

the fathers are now beln? defied: that prosper

the integrity of American instltuticns. For my
self I have never been In favor of asserting
dominion by the sworl and I did not hesitate
in face of an adverse majority in the council
halls of this catlcn, when I knew that the
judgment cf the body to which I belong-d
would be entered against me. to protest against
the use of the American flasr in the cause of

I pmestÂ»d aeainst that which should nnove us
against our duty or destroy that grÂ»at edifice.
I knew that humanity through the ares had
not failed to yield to temptation. I had seen
in history mighty nations, based on cardinal
principles of rectitude, moved from lir,eÂ« of
duty by success, and. plunging into Indiscre

was truly tb^trs. I thought that this republic

THE DISTRICT
CONVENTIONS
James O'Brien proposed a vote of
thanks to Chairman Famsworth. The
motion prevailed. Thanks were abo given
to the officers of the convention and the
people of Sacramento. The convention
adjourned at 1 o'clock with three cheers
for William J. Bryan.
d<='egate from the First Cor.gTe?siona! Dis
trict of this State I desire to state that I
voice the sentiments of this district when
I say that they a3 an entirety and as a
unit are in favor of this amendment. (Ap
piause.) It has not been my privilege in
the past to attend a State convention of
the Democratic party or to take any
prominent i-ert In the councils of that
party outs'dc- of the county of Napa. but
I do understand, from conversation with
members from ihe interior of this State,
that the power heretofore given to the
chairman of the convention to name twen
ty or twenty-live delegates at large has
resulted in concentrating the. power of the
State Central Committee in one particular
section of- the State. (Applause.) If we
believe in ttie principles of Thomas Jeffer
son, and we have declared so within the
last fifteeen minutes, then we believe in
equal privileges to ail: we believe In the
distribution cf power; we believe In mak
ing it uniform. And while we do not im
pute anything: to the honorable gentleman
who now presides over this august as
semblage, we do say, if you adept this
amendment it will Insure to the whole
State of California a uniform representa
tion upon the State Central Committee of
this party. (Applause.) There can be no
harm in placing the powÂ«r In the chairman
to select three of these^members at large
from tach of the seven Congressional dis
tricts cf this Stare, because we have never
believed, we people up here In the moun
tains or in the sunny valleys of Napa.,
that all the ability and talent of the Dem
ocratic party of the State was consoli
dated in a "single or two Congressional
districts of the State. We believe you will
have no difficulty, in the First Con
gressional District at least, .in securing
three as good mm as you will find if you
go south or north, or in any direction
which you may seek, and therefore we
give some credit to the other Congression
al districts of the State, and we believe
that the chairman can go into each of
those seven districts and select three
members from each district and thereby
meet the wishes of these districts. I thank
you/'pent!emtn, fcr your patience. iAp
plause.)
l!r. Woodman of Sacramento â Mr.
Chairman, tis a representative of the Sec
end Congressional District I wish to coin
cide with the views of the gentleman of
the First. 1 do rot wish to impugn the
motives- or the honestv of our chairman,
but I will ?av that I would not be willing
to give that power to William Jennings
Bryan. :he leader of the Democracy of
the United States. I do r.ot think it is
Democracy. I think you will find just as
much ability in every district of this
State as you will find in one or two dis
tricts. I am in favor cf the amendment.
The amendment was adopted.
Mr. Gouldâ Mr. Chairman, by experience
in the past, what I have seen and what I
have been able, to accomplish as chairman
of the State Central Committee, I do not
believe it makes any material difference
whether the?*- men are appointed from
the seven Conirress-ional districts or not,
I believe that as a rule they have been
fairly distributed throughout the State
and I do not believe there is any objection
to the amendment. So far as I am con
cerned as one of the committee I have
none.
Gavin McXab â I would like to ask. does
the chairman appoint these men from the
Congressional districts or are they to be
in addition to those already provided, to
be supplied by the Congressional district??
How are they to be selected?
The Chairman â As I understand It they
are to lÂ«z appointed by the chairâ in addi
tion to the others already provided for.
The *jueetion is now on the adoption of the
report as amended.
ThÂ« ayea and noes -were called for and
the report adopted.
The Chairmanâ The next order of busi
ness is the election of four delegates at
lar?<? and the election cf four alternate
delegates at large to the National Conven
tion.
Senator A. F. Jonps of Butte moved that
the convention take a recess until S:30
p. rn.
Motion seconded and carried.
When the convention assembled at 9
o'clock the chairman said: "Gentlemen
of the convention, at the time that the
committee on permanent organization
and order of business reported, all of the
rt-port was adopted with the exception
of the fifth subdivision, that providing for

adopted. (
Mr. Braunhartâ I move that the report of the

committee.
The Chairman â The Question is en the adop

The motion was put and carried and the
report ad<^pted.

The Chairman â Th^re is a rÂ»g"u!ar order of

for. The nÂ«xt business in ortT is the elec

national convention. Nominations for delegates
are now in order.
Troy Nominates White.
R. P. Troy of San Francisco â Mr. Chairman
and pentiemen of the convention: I deem it
a distinguished privilege to be permitted to
suggest here to-ntght. as one of the delegates
at large to the Democratic National Cor.ven
ticn the name of California* most brilliant
sÂ» is.' the Hon. Stephen M. White. (Great ap
f.lause and cheers.) I scarcely deem it essen
tial to supplement this nomination with the
uÂ«ual encomiums that arÂ» submitted to a con
vention ft the candldary of those who geek
honors within Us gift, because I feel that every
member of this body 1Â» mere than familiar *tth
the name and with the well-earned fame of
Senator White; and ret I car.net repress the
sentiment that In honoring him we will do
honor to ourselves (applause), for. wherever
the illustrious men cf this nation are cherished,
wherever our greatest statesmen are honored,
wherever our most illustrious orators are ad
mired, wherever our ablest thinkers are appre
ciated, there the hcr.cred name of Stephen M.

The Coquitlam is a vessel of 300 tors
and about 185 feet long. She is owned
by th*i Union Steamship Company, who
.fUII have an action .unsettled against the
United States Government In .connection
with her seizure in the Bering Sea seal
ing "troubles ten years ago.
The loss cannot 1 3 less than twenty or
thirty thousand dollars. The y fire is
thought to have started in the hold. The
Coqultlam had no' passengers. There
seems to be a hoodoo on this trip of the
Coqultlam. She started out from the
Union Steamship Company's wharf and
had not gone twenty feet before her
propeller struck a rock and three blades
were stripped from her wheel. She went
into drydock for a new propeller and this
kept her two days longer. Since the
steamers from Puget Sound stopped call
ing here 1 the local boats have been en
tirely unable to handle the business, thus
the Coquitlam was loaded way below her
waterline.
VANCOUVER, B C June 14.â The
steamer Coqultlam of Bering Sea seizure
fame was badly damaged by fire yester
day. She had left here only four hours
for Skaguay with a $100,000 cargo on
board, and was well out in the Gulf of
Georgia when smoke was noticed coming
from her hatches. Captain Carley
thought they would have little trouble
in extinguishing the flames and contin
ued up the gulf. " Before dark the smoke
was becoming worse than ever and the
source of the fire could nq,t be- got at.
The boat wasjow down in the water with
all the deckload that could he piled
aboard her. The deck cargo could not be
removed, and the captain decided to run
her to Texada Island and beach her.
Early this morning she fell in with the
steamer Comox. which brought the news
to Vancouver this afternoon. The Co
mox helped her to beach. The flames
were then coming through the hatches.
When the Comox left all hands were
rushing the work of throwing out the
deck cargo, and it was thought that the
larger part of her hold was on fire. The
cargo consisted of general merchandise
bound for Dav.-son and was for the most
part uninsured.

the decision of the Board of General Ap
praisers, assessing a duty of 35 cents per
pound on 100 bales of leaf or filler tobacco.
The, importers protested, claiming that
the merchandise was not subject to duty,
because Porto Rico was not j a foreign
country and because, therefore, the "im
position of duties on goods brought from
a place within the territory of the United
States into a part of the United States
is not lawful and scheduled under the
constitution." Judge Townsend said:
Before the war with Spain Porto Rico was
a foreign country- It did not cease to be
a foreign country when, it was>occupied by the
military forces of the United States.
The conquest of Porto Rico under authority
of the executive made it ours by military title.
But the President's conquests do not enlarge
the boundaries of thta Union, nor extend the
operation of our Institutions and laws beyond
the limits ..before assigned to them by the
legislative power. Our boundaries could not be
regulated by the varying- Incidents of war and
be enlarged or diminished as the arms on
either Bide advanced or retreated. In this
sense, therefore, our constitutional boundaries
do not "follow. the flag." {
Judge Townsend said this could only
be done by the treaty making power or
legislative authority.

in the case of John H. Geolz & Co. vs.
The United States, in which he declared
the treaty of Paris valid and that the
status of tne people of " Porto Rico is
that of Inhabitants of a foreign country
as regards the constitution of the United

Porto Rico is part of the United States,
so far as other countries are concerned,
but so. far as the constitution of this
country is concerned is a foreign country
aÂ»|cl that the United States can govern it
wfthout subjecting it to the burden of na

During the short time that I knew her
I treated her with the utmost respect.

The Wounded Man's Story.
With a cry of pain Clinton turned
around and. seeing the woman with the
smoking pistol in her right hand, grabbed
her. As he struggled to get possession of
the weapon Fhe frantically endeavored to
fire another bullet into him, but was pre
vented by a young man named William
Stacke, who was an eye-witness to the
;.< hooting. With the assistance of Police
OSlcer Wlnzler the infuriated Â¦woman â¢was
finally overpowered and the pistol taken
/torn her. As it xas first thought that
â¢Jllnton was fatally shot he was hurried
io the Receiving Horpltal. Mis? Ellsmere
accompanied him. She seemed greatly
iTelieved when told that he was not dan
gerously injured. While the wound was
.toeing dressed Clinton made the following
statement of the shooting:
The Shooter Arrested.
Clinton left the theater shortly after 11
o'clock a-ecoinpariled by Miss Kdna Klls
mcre, the leading lady of the company.
They walked along Third street to Jessie
and up the latter street to Fourth. Clin
ton was aware that the Abbott wfeman
was following them, but he hoped to es
cape her by taking a circuitous route to
his home, which is on Shotwell street. As
he and his corr.panlon reached Mission
and Fourth streets the jilted woman
sneaked up behind him and, taking a
pistol from her pocket, fired. The bullet
etruck the leading man In the right thigh
and passed through his leg.

While at the hospital the leading man
was constantly attended by Miss Ells

room while Assistant Police Surgeon C. D.
McGettigan dressed the wound and made
Clinton a? comfortable as possible.
It is understood that Cllntfen and Miss
Ellsmere are engaged, but this is denied
by several members of the company.
He says that even if she had shook her
purse under his nose he would not have
accepted any part of the contents.
Clinton denies that he ever accepted a
cent from Miss Abbott.
Denies Her Story.
"Evidently hoping to avoid me he and
his lady friend hastily walked up Jessie
street. I followed behind them and when
they reached Fourth street I went up to
him and shot him. I am sorry I made
suoh a bad job of it. He has wrecked
my young life and I cannot see him live
with another woman. I know I will be
sent to jatrfor shooting him, but I hops
they will not give me a long sentence. I

to be revenged. Going to a gunsmith's
store I bought the revolver with which I
shot him. I am sorry I did not kill him,
as he has ruined my life. It was my In
tention to also shoot Miss Ellsmere/as I
know that she had won his heart, but at
the last moment my nerve failed me, and
I concluded not to Injure her.
"Knowing that the performance would
be over by 11 o'clock, I placed the re
volver in my pocket and started out, de
termined to make Clinton a subject for
the Coroner. I lay in wait in the alley
adjoining the theater and eagerly watched
for him. As he-, walked down the street
with Miss Ellemere leaning on his arm I
reached for my revolver, intending to
Fhoot him on the spot, but as I feared
that I might kill some Innocent porson I
resolved to follow him and await a more
favorable opportunity.

INQUESTS OVER
STRIKE VICTIMS
AT ST. LOUIS
Jury Returns a Verdict of
Homicide in One
i / Case.
Deputy Sheriff Marsh, Who Did the
Shooting, Is Missing, and It Is
Believed He Has Left the
City.
ST. LOUIS. June 14.-The predictions
that yesterday witnessed the beginning of
the end of the great street railway strike
were corroborated to-day when the police
department withdrew its officers from all
the cars and power-houses of the St. Louis
Transit Company and returned them to
their regular beats. The Transit Company
continued to augment its force of non
union men and Its transportation facilities
at a ratio that promises to see the system
In full swing before many more days have
passed.
Much interest is being shown by the gen
eral public In the Coroner's inquest at
present in progress over the bodies of
strikers and a citizen killed last Sunday
by members of the Sheriff's posse comi
tatus. The testimony adduced at to-day's
hearing does not deny that Deputy Sheriff
Marsh shot Frederick Bohne. the citizen
in question, but the witnesses disagreed
as to the deputy's provocatlorxfor shoot
ing.
There was testimony from about thirty
five witnesses, consuming three hours,
after which the jury returned a verdict of
homicide. A sensational feature of the In
quest was the conflicting statements made
by witnesses as to whether Police Lieuten
ant .Stack ordered the deputy sheriffs to
fire on the crowd. Several of the deputies
testified that he ordered the posse jruard
to shoot, while Stack declared he did all
in his power to prevent the deputies from
firing.
The disappearance of Deputy Sheriff
Marsh was a startling development at the
inquest. It is believed that Marsh has left
the city. No further search will be made
for him probably unless friends of the
dead man seek to prosecute him. the ver
dict of the Coroner's jury being consid
ered practically an exoneration.
The day passed practically without In
cident.

â¢wore pleased to zret so much English

for the Transvaal. Mr. Crowe, the Brit
ish Consul General, has large stocks of
clothing for the British prisoners, but he
will not forward these until he gets as
surances that the Boers will not take
tliem for their own use."
A fliepalch from Lourenzo Marques,
<3ated yesterday, says: "President
Kruffer Is holding on to Ms gold and issu
ing paper notes from a press in his execu
tive car. The Boer Government's coin In
stock is exhausted and the ofllclals are

Kruger Holds on to Gold.
A.notlier ilachadodorp announcement is
that the first regiment of General Buller's
force attacked Aimonds Nek and waa
â¢â¢annihilated," but as the British were In
overwhelming force, the burghers were
compelled to Abandon the Kek.
"Both wings of the federal forces
touched the advancing army at 1 a. m.
yesterday near Pretoria. Fighting con
tinued until dark. The enemy, though In
overwhelming numbers, were checked
along a line of thirty-six miles, and the
burghers succeeded In driving back their
right wing live miles. Two burghers were
killed and ten wounded."
LONDON*, June 13. 3:33 a. m.â That
Commandant General Louis Botha
f=hou!d 'have been aW" to stan<I
for two days against Iiord Roberts
and then to retreat without losing
ery guns or having any of his men cap
tured is iaken to mean that he has a force
which the British must still reckon as
formidable when acting defensively. The
paclf.eation of the -whole of the Trans
vaal, especially the wide spaces, far from
the railways. Is looked upon as a. busi
ness requiring months rather than weeks.
Meanwhile everything goes well for the
British arms. A Boer bulletin Issued
June 12. at Machadodorp, said:
"The enemy evacuated their strong po
sition during the night and have retired
to the eastward. Puller's forces and my
own have afforded each other mutual as
sistance. Our occupation of Pretoria
caused numbers of Boers to withdraw
from Laings Nek. and Buller's advance
to Volksrust made them feel their rear
would be shortly endangered."
The War Office Issues the following re
port from Lord Roberts under date of
Pretoria, June 13, afternoon:
"Methuen advanced to Honlngsprult
yesterday and found all quiet. Kroonstad
is stronR-ly held. Methuen returned to
day to Rhenoster River, where the rail
way is being repaired. We were engaged
all day yesterday with Botha's army.
The enemy fought with considerable de
termination, and held our cavalry on both
flanks, but Ian Hamilton, assisted by the
Guards' brigade of Pole-Carow's divis
ion, pushing forward, took the hill in his
front, which caused the enemy to fall
back on their second position to the east
ward. This they are stfll holding. It is
slightly higher than the one we have cap
tured."

puts is, "Will my husband be shot if he is

One young man was pulled from under a

British not to shoot him.
General Rundle nad a sharp skirmish at
Ficksburg on June 12. The Boers had been

Boers in front with two g-uns while Yeo

drove them off. with a loss to the British
of three wounded. Two patrols were also

"Among the Boer agents here there is

these nepotlatJons Is not made public. Mr.
Wolmarans has arrived here. He declares
that he intends to take no further part in

PACIFICATION OF THE
TRANSVAAL IS FAR OFF
The younger Mr. Aubert said last night
that he did not feel that the illness would
terminate seriously. It doubtless was the
result of the fatiguing overland journey.
Mr. Aubert has a daughter, Mra. P. St.

Stein. Simon & Cu. r\t this city; also a
son, Lucien J. Aubert, exchange teller In
the London, Paris and American Bank.

age, was born In Paris, but has been lo
cated in San Francisco for the last forty

talk was rambling and he utterly refused
to eat or sleep.' Bv the time the tram
reached New York he was unable to an
swer the most simple questions.
He was taken to Bellevue by Policeman
Fitchell. At first the physicians were In
clined to believe that Aubert was sham
ming, but they soon changed their minds.
He seemed to be rational, yet their ques
tions brought from him nothing but un
intelligible exclamations. Finally a phy
sician was found who speaks French. He
spoke to Aubert In his native tongue, and
had no difficulty tri conversing with him.
He found that the patient had lost the
last half century. With it is gone his
knowledge of the Enplish language. He
knows nothing of current history. French
or American, but of the events of the
revolution of 1S48 he speaks as though it
was just now that the commune ruled In
the streets of Paris. To him Louis Phil
ippe still lives and he would have been not
in the least surprised had he been told
that the old.exile had regained his throne.
At Bellevue Hospital the physlcidns said
that Aubert's trouble was largely of an
emotional nature. A long rest would
bring him around to mental health and
he would gradually recover his knowledge
of the fifty years which he has spent In
America.
Paul Aubert of Sg,n Francisco Suffering
From Aphasia Due to the : Ex-
/ citement of Travel.
NEW YORK, June 14.â Overcome by his
emotions at thought of returning to his
native France, Paul Louis Aubert arrived
in New York to-day, from San Francisco
In a condition of aphasia. His case is the
most remarkable that has come under the
observation of the physicians at Bellevue
Hospital, whither he was taken from the
Grand Central station. Although they are
puzzled by some of the symptoms exhib
ited by him, they predict his speedy and
complete recovery.
Aubert knows his own name and in a
manner understands the nature of his
trouble, but his life for the last fifty years
Is to him a complete blank. His mind has
gone back to the days when he was a boy
in France. Of the events of that time he
speaks as though they were just passed
into history. Ills firs"t question to-night
after -a degree of consciousness had re
turned to him was as to whether Louis
Philippe had been restored to his throne.
Paul Aubert, according to papers found
In his pockets, is about 65 years old. He
lives at 1314 O'Farrell street, San Francis
co, in which city he was in the Jewelry
business. He Is supposed to be a man of
wealth, though more of his history will
be known after the California authorities
have been heard from,
He came "to America when a lad of 15
years and has lived here ever since. Let
ters found In his possession show that for
a long time he had been planning a visit
to his old home. It was his intention to
see the exposition In Paris and then spend
a few weeks visiting with those of his
childhood friends who are still alive.
Aubert left San Francisco four d*ys aÂ«o.
At that time he was in the best of health
and spirits." As he traveled eastward his
excitement increased, until the breaking
point was reached. Edmund S. Ricketts,
conductor of the New York Central lim

On the conclusion of the programme
Father Yorke presented diplomas to Mary
I. Cooney. Sadie A. McLaughlln and Mar
caret M. Roche. He thanked the persons
present in the name of the Sisters of the
> cariemy for their attendance and the
W Â»ral manner In which they responded
t* 'hÂ«Â» needs of the parish school. Branch
i$2 out into the advantages of giving chil
;>.-n a good religious education, he com
pared the schools conducted by the Sisters
with those of a secular character: holding
that no education can be of the right
kind if the religious training be omitted.
To the parents alone and not to the State
should the right of educating the child
be entrusted, he said. Catholic schools
belonged to the common people who built
them.
Father Yorke admitted that it pleased
him to know that the presidents of the
two great universities of California ad
mitted that education In the Catholic col
leges was just as> good as that given In
their colleges. Speaking of Palo Alto, he
said, in part, that it was simply a private
institution backed by millions of dollars,
with vineyards in every county in the
State to contribute to its support. This
he eomnared with Catholic colleges hav
ing nothing but the generous offerings of
those who believed in supporting such in
stitutions for the good that came from
them: for without religion, no education
would make good citizens, he said.
The speaker dwelt at some length on
the proposed amendment to the consti
tution havinc for its obiect the exempt
ing of Stanford's University from taxa
tion. This he opposed lwcause it was dis
criminating in favor of the rich as against
the poor colleges.

Paul Strickert Will Secure a Licensa
to Wed Martha Rachpauer, Who
Sued Him for 550,000.
Paul Strickert. who was recently sued
by Martha Rachpauer for 550.0OD damages
for breach of promise, visited "Cupid"
Danforth yesterday and asked for a mar
riage license to wed the fair plaintiff In
the case. The suit is pending in Judge
Daingerfleld's court, and Strickert will
now put an end to the litigation, which
might result in financial loss to himself.
Miss Rachpauer alleged in her complaint
that ritrlckert had promised to marry her
within four months, and she had remained
single with that expectation. Strickert
filed an answer in which he denied that
he had promised to marry the lady in four
months' time, but said he was ready and
willing to marry her at some later date.
He aiso filed a written release of all
claims of varied character signed by Miss
Rachpauer.
Stiickert informed Danforth that he had
made up his mind to marry Miss Kach
pauer, but that her lawyers had
advised her to refuse his offer because she
owed him some fees. He desired to know
whether he could be held responsible for
debts contracted by the lady before his
marriage to her, and on being informed
that he could not the license was made
out.
Just before passing the paper to Strick
ert Danforth asked him if he was going
to be married in this city, and the pros
pective groom replied that he was going
to Oakland to have the knot tied. Dan
forth Informed him that the license was
only good in this city and county, but
Strickert said that he wanted to be mar
ried by an old clergyman friend In Oak
land, and he left to secure the license in
that city.

will be succeeded by Henry Lange of St.
Helena Grove, at present deputy noble j
grand arch. He has been a Druid fnr I
more than a quarter of a century and has
during that time made many friends in
the ord?r. Jules S. Godeau. at present Â¦
grand guard, will be rao<t undoubtedly the i
next deputy grand arch, as there Is no '
one as a candidate against him. He Is a '
member of Perseverance Grove of this
city. John M. Graves, who has been |
grand secretary for years, will be J
a candidate for re-election. He is a mem
ber of Modesto Grove. K. H. Goetze will |
not be a candidate for the office of grand
treasurer that he has filled for several
years. The only one spoken of for that
position is James Hagan of Laurel Grove j
of this city. For the offlce of grand mar- I
sbal G. H. Bertram of JCorma Grove and j
C, Guglielmoni of Aurora Grove will be
candidates. Three supreme representn- 1
lives will be selected from the following i

Geology Is more closely related to the
intelligent development of the material
resources of a country than la any other
branch of natural science. Upon the raw
materials furnished by mining and agri
culture all forms of manufacturing and
commercial Industry are primarily based,
and with both these fundamentals geology
is inextricably involved. The science has
therefore both Us applied and Its purely
scientific aspects, and It Is necessary* 0
appreciate its dual character in order to
establish a correct perspective in compar
ing Its condition In the year 1S00 with that
in the year 19D0. The Importance of this
appreciation lies in the fact that in
its application to industrial needs geology
has claims to governmental support, and
it is by the aid of national and State geo
logical surveys that the recent great ad
vances in the science have been made pos
sible.
By the close of the eighteenth century
the larger facts in the structure of the
globe were familiar to all men of science
who had given them attention. Mines had
been In operation for 2000 yeara and more,
and had been conducted with much intel
ligence for several centuries. It was evi
dent to all observers that disturbances
of the earth's crust had taken
place, that folds, faults and Joints
had resulted, and that the cracks had in
many cases been filled with later minerals.
Kocks were known to be of both sedi
mentary and of igneous origin. It was
well appreciated that some were older
than otners, but the classifications into
time series were very incomplete, espe
cially for the paleozoic strata. In the re
lated department of mineralogy the com
moner species had been Identified and
named and considerable information was
current regarding their chemical compo
sition. Fossils had- been long known and
had been correctly interpreted as the re
mains of the former organisms. In the
Paris basin several observers had shown
that the fossils followed one another in
/equence, and were, within limits, char
'aeterlsilc of particular strata and useful
for their Identification, but this knowledge
was restricted to a very few savants. In
the opening years of the present century
it was made generally available in France
by Cuvler.and Brogniart and was devel
oped quite "Independently by William
Smith in England. In the closing years of
the eighteenth century, however, most
men interested in this branch were appar
ently not aware of the importance, or. In
fact, of the existence, of these relations.
- In the eighteenth century only a small
part of , tne world had been geologically
described, and that with a very Imper
fect scientific vocabulary. France. Ger
many. Italy, Russia and England had re
ceived considerable attention, but the
rest of the world remained for the fu
ture. The terra incognita is indeed by
np means exhausted even to-day, but 100
years ago the two Americas, Asia. Af
rica and Australia can hardly be said to
have existed so far as geological knowl
edge is concerned. Governmental surveys
had scarcely begun. The science ad
vanced by individual effort, which often
taxed the means of the Investigator to
the breaking point. Scientists were also
largely . Influenced by the metaphysical
tendencies of their own and previous cen
turies. They had not altogether outgrown
earlier habits of thought, induced by older
methods of education.
All this being true, it was natural that
writers on geology during this period de
veloped in their scientific work tendencies
to speculative systems, to the creation of
hypotheses, to grand generalizations and
to the formulation of theoretical views
w.lth which they sought to make nature
conform. They exhibit all the character
istics of half-informed minds. The soil
was fertile and seeds had been sown, but
much of the resulting vegetation proved
io be weeds and of necessity had to be
cut down and destroyed. Of this charac
ter were the extreme views of the Nep
tunfsts. of the Plutonists and in the years
soon after ISOO of the searchers after so
called world-hypothesis. Of them all the
NeptunJsts were the most important and
in some respects the most unfortunate in
their Influence. It required many years
and a hard struggle with an Insidious
foe to rid geological thought of their mis
taken conceptions and doctrines.
Early in the present century a reaction
set in. Hypotheses were abandoned for
observation and record. Geological socie
ties and geological sections in scientific
societies of a more general nature were
established and archives of record were
provided. Governmental geological sur
veys found favor and by the end of the
fifth decade were or had been in opera
tion In almost all the more advanced
States and countries. Their systematic
work and their reports from trained ob
servers, directed by a single responsible
head, soon placed at command a vast
amount of information of which the fath
ers in the science had no conception. The
oretical views more and more grew to
be based on sound evidence and to be
worthy of acceptance by conservative stu
dents. Besides tho printed reports the
surveys have provided geologists at large
with maps, both topographical and geo
logical, and before the admiring and al
most bewildered gaze~of the onlooker
have unrolled the geological panorama
with a richness and fullness not dreamed
of at the close of the last century.
Under a few topics it is possible to sum

up the cbief subjects in which 19C0 shows
the greatest advance over 1S00.
The most ancient rocks are recognized
now to be Igneous In their nature and
when they possess a foliation which sug
gests sedimentary bedding it is thought
to be due to mechanical crushing and
shearing. The- foliated structure had for
merly led many to believe in their sedi
mentary origin. On the other hand, tho
development of reliable methods of ob
servation of phenomena in the Held and
the interpretation of the mineralo?lcal
and chemical composition of crystalline
rocks In the laboratory have made possi
ble a vast advance in our knowledge of
those elusive members of the earth's
crust which are usually described a*
"metamorphic." Not alone in appreciat
ing the igneous nature of some but In de
monstrating the sedimentary nature el
others and In working out the structure
of many complex areas, such as the Alps.
the Scottish highlands and the Lake Su
perior region, have we gained outposts far
in .advance of those held in the year ISOO.
To-day we regard these problems as
among the most attractive or the science,
although their difficulty is not belittled.
When the strata of the older fossillfer
ous periods, J. . e., those constituting the
paleozoic era, are considered, the advance
in knowledge ia simply astonishing. The
geologists of the last century knew Uttlo
of these beds; their experience, so far ai
any stratigraphy worthy of the namn
was concerned, was limited to the meso
zolc and cenozoic formations. To-day wo
are well aware that fossils occur as far
back as the base of the Cambrian, if nut
still lower. Faunas have been collected,
studied and classified from strata that
our forefathers would have given up as
hopeless. The next century will probably
push the limits still further back, and al
ready In tho closing years of the present
one several keen observers have found
encouragement for this expectation. In
deed, geology presents no more attractive
field for investigation.
In the study of faunas, floras . and
the general life of the past the biological
investigator has been irresistibly led up>
to the conceptions of evolution, and con
versely the thought of the later students
has been most strongly Influenced by
these views. Their appreciation and adop
tion were inevitable with the growth or
knowledge, and they have In turn cast a.
flood of light upon the development of
life In the past. Yet no one believes that
the last word has been said and many
curious facts and relations remain to
be explained. The forces back of organic
growth, as applied to the genus or group
as well as the species and individual. givÂ«
subjects for meditation to the well-in
formed mind, especially If it possess a
philosophical tendency. Most important
of all in this respect is the origin and fu
1 AnofheTo" that are entire
ly the product of the century now closing
is that of the glacial period. It was sug
gested in the earlier aecades. but it ha*
had its chief development in the later
ones. Its phenomena are so widespread
and familiar in our northern latitudes that
it has elements of great popularity. a3
well as profound scientific character.
That the great ice sheet existed no one
longer questions, but as to what caused it
thefe is still wide difference of op nion.
Astronomical variations, continental ele
vations and changes In the percentage of
carbonic acid in the atmosphere have all
been cited. There may be others of which
we have no present anticipation, but tho
last two certainly seem, to have been or
serious moment. The phenomena pro
duced by the Ice sheets are now recorded
and described in great detail, and for
their interpretation much study has been
given to Greenland and other polar re
gions which stiU preserve the conditions
now fong past In southern latitudes.
The study of the moraines and other de
posits of the continental glacier, as well
as investigations of the earth's surface In
unglaciated regions, have brought into
prominence the Importance of a proper
understanding of land foVms and land
sculpture. This fascinating department of
geology has developed almost into a sepa
rate school of scientific work. Its general
importance lies In Its Influence on the
proper study of geography in the schools,
and therein its effect is far-reaching.
Realizing as a fundamental conception
that all land forms are the results of the
action of geological forces, the mountains.
valleys, coasts and Interior plains are
explained upon this basis even to the very
young. Rivers and lakes reveal life his
tories, and a mountain range becomes not
merely a series of lines on a map. but a
great topographical barrier that may
have had a powerful Influence, as In the
case of our Appalachians, upon the de
velopment ot the country. True concep
tions may thus be established at the very
outset which will afterward bear upon
historical study in a most Important man
ner. History, political economy and all
the subjects connected with the evolution
of States are Involved In it.
And finally. In modem mining and quar
rying, in agriculture and work of an en
gineering nature, the influence of broader
and more â¢correct views la manifest on
every hand. Greater certainty of opera
tion, less and less of wild and unreason
able expectation and more and more of
intelligent development are manifested, so
that in many ways not always realized by
the general public the civilization of the
closing year of the nineteenth century
owes a great debt to geology.

The Day Parade Committee Will Ask
Every County to Participate
in the Grand Demon
stration.
At tho last session of the joint ninth of
September committee of the Native Sons
of the Golden West Charles H. Turner,
chairman of the naval parade committee,
was authorized to appoint seven persons
not members of the general committee,
six of whom should not be : members of
the order. Yesterday Mr. Turner made
the following appointments: John D.
Spreckels. who shall be commodore of the
naval parade; Captain N. T. James of the
Naval Militia; Captain William G. Leale,
chairman of the .fllot Commissioners; P.
H. Barber, the pioneer pilot and head of
the San Francisco Pilots; Allen M. Clay,
secretary of the Bank of California and
ex-coromoaore of the California Yacht
Club; and Al Pryor of the Piper-Aden-
Gcoaali company. The seventh is Ad
miral H. H. jjryaen, who was appointed
a few tiays since. '.These gentlemen will
lend their assistance to the committee to
the er.a that tne naval parade snail sur
pass any otncr display ot this nature ever
seen on can r ranciseu bay. .
At a meeting ui me o.uy parade commit
tee, heia at lue neauquariers in the Pal
ace Hotel, lieutenant Coionel Boxton,
chief oi staff, suggested that it would bt
a gooa iuea tor tuÂ« dative aons to confer
a truiy caniornia name on the park on
Thineer.tn street, and that it should^ be
dedicaic-a bv them on tne ninth of bep
temcer. This committee will send invita
tions to omclals in every county in the
State to participate in the celebration.
Each county will be asKed to contribute
a float tor the parade. Major General
Shatter. will oe asKed to co-operate with
the Native Sons, and It was stated that
he would consent to do so. Hereafter tne
committee win meet every Wednesday.
Next week the conierence committee will
meet tne parade committee.
Otto Liming of OaKtano. sent word to
headquarters that he would furnish two
beautitully decorated carriages for the
parade and that he would use his influ
ence to have others do tr-.e same.
San Francisco Parlor will parade 100
strong on black horses and will be preced
ed by a band of twenty-live pieces. The
uniform will be black, with soft black
hats, the saddle clotns to be trimmed with
yellow. The men on horses will bo fol
lowed by a large float. Thomas T. Stack
has been appointed aid to the grand mar
shal from this parlor.
Mission Panor has sent in a request that
Del B. Bowley. one of its members, be ap
pointed a division marshal.
. National Parior win wear a uniform to
consist ot biack pantaloons, with a gold
stripe down the s:de. black shirt, soft
black hat and a yellow scarf. Each mem
ber will also wear a gold tie and a hand
some badge adorned with the srolden pop
py. On tne night of the 7th of September
this parlcr will give a grand reception at
the Terhau Tavern. .

How to Tit a Shoe.
"People would find less difficulty In suit-
Ing themselves with ready- made shoes."
said an experienced shoemaker, "If thev
would stand up to have them fitted. Nine
persons out of ten require a particularly
comfortable chair when they are having
shoes tried on and lt Is difficult to make
them stand for a few minutes even when
the shoe Is fitted. Then, when they be
gin to walk about they are surprised
that the shoes are less comfortable than
they wore when first fitted. The reason
Is simple.
"The foot la smaller when- one sits in a
chair than lt is when one is walking
about. Exercise brings a considerable
quantity of blood to the feet, which ac
cordingly swell. The muscles also expand.
These facts must bo borne in mind when
one buys one's shoes, or discomfort and
disappointment are sure to be the result.
People who are not comfortable in ready
made shoes should have both feet meas
ured. The result will generally be the dis
covery that they have feet of different
sizes and therefore need specially made
shoes." â Washington Star.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, June 14.â The market for wheat
opened strong. July %c to 114c over yesterday,
at 74HS"<%. This wan because of heavy rains
in the South ond Southwest and because early
reports showed that the Northwest during the
previous twenty-four hours had but little rain.
There was a big business done the first hour,
mainly between 73*i<gT74c. The crop reports
from the territory which has absorbed atten
tion recently were not materially changed from
their gloomy tenor. A reaction was started by
the Weather Bureau prediction of rains In
Minnesota and the Dakotas. Later Aberdeen.
S. D., wired that rain was- falling there.
Longs sold heavily, the Northwest following
the local lead, and July gradually declined to
72%c. The close was weak, July %c down, at
72M~!e.
Corn opened with a show of strength "which
subsequently it was unable to maintain. The
opening spurt was Â¦ due largely- to the wheat
bulge. The reaction In the market, together
with favorable crop reports later, caused a
reaction and the close was easy. July closed
',4c lower, at 3S&.
Oats wera strong and fairly active, although
the trade was not larze. â¢ There seemed to be
eotno fear of a squeeze In July, and this, com-
Chicago Grain Market.
Chicnso improved at the opening-, but fell
back on realizing:, and predicted showers In

very best estimate. Corn was firm.

"Prunes still continue to pass Into consump
tion in this country at a pood rate, mostly In
Fir.all lets, and sales of them to European
houses are being made ripht along. Evapo
rated prime apples are in good demand at SVjc.
while waste and chorÂ» practically are not
wanted by any one. Future apples continue
very weak. Dried pears are in Eome demand
Bt a low figure. Currants are much firmer.
Nuts are very quiet."
"California is gradually making a wider
channel for Its fruit In Europe, especially !n
England. Great Britain, with it* population
cf 4S,00f.',O00 souls, is the most promising mar
kot for all crops which California produces.
There Is no other country In the world where
to much wealth Is concentrated within so small
a compass. The English i>eople sjxfnd a vast
amount cf money for food and drink, and In
no other European country do orchard products
bring iuch good prices. The English people
at present !!ve differently than the population
of forty years ago. At that time th<? peoplÂ«
almost entirely subsisted urÂ«>n gTain products,
potatoes, meat and fish, with what llttlÂ«> fruit
of their own growth they could have in season.
It la different now. Even the humblest work
lnpman expects fruit of some kind upon his
table, and he looks principally to America for
his supply. The English people are fond of
prunes, and will buy them at ar.y reasonable
price. It Is now recognized that the flavor,
body and saccharine composition of California
fruit ie greater than in the fruit grown in
Trance. Spain or Italy. California oranpes are
reserved for the wealthy because of the high
prices rullrp."
The s- a me Journal thus reports the New York
dried fruit market as follows:

I to r.nd a salient point In to-day's stock market
on which to hang an intelligent opinion of the
conditions and the prospects. Trading was a
step nearer to the point of absolute stagna
tion and the movement of prices throughout
showed doubt and hesitation Just as It
has for some time past. Prices are lower on
the day. but the losses serve as little to carry
conviction of the underlying easiness of the
market as did yesterday's gains of any
strength. Certainly there was no heavy llqui
! datlon or pressing upon the market to-day.
Sales were quite inappreciable which were
made for any other cccount than that of email
rc-om traders, who would eagerly close a con
tract If they saw p. profit of or % In the
', change of price. The dullness became so por
tentous that the bear traders began to divine
all sorts of damaging possibilities, the best
defined of which was an impending commercial
1 failure, amounting up into an indefinite num
ber of millions. Diligent inquiry on the trail
of this rumor led into bucket-shops, where the
trail was loÂ«=t. The foreign stock markets were
j In the same condition as the New York mar
: ket as to dullness of the speculative interest.
; but showed some flrmncf! in the reduction of
th-? 1'ank of England discount rate. Private
discount rattÂ»s in London went lower and the
hardening at the rate in Berlin nnd further
easing of st>-rling rates both in Paris and Berlin
seemed without effect upon the London money
markt-t, which Is apparently reconciled to sur
rendering some of its (supply of gold to Paris.
The Bank of France showed a further reduc
tion of iis note Ipsu^ and a further contrac- ;
tion of its loans for the week, notwithstanding
a further increase in Its gold supplies of over
$*00.(-00. The demand for time money In New
York for the longer periods up to seven and
eight months was distinctly greater. The pup
ply to meet the demand was apparently ample.
The sub-treasury statement showed a gain for
yesterday of $3,T"S.Â«".i>i. as a result of the pay
meata for the gold bars which were exported |
on to-day's steamer to France. Apparently the j
banks have not made any remittance to the
Government Institution as yet In response to
the call of the Treasury Department for $3.
(â¢(â¢O.OOO for Government deposits. Money Is still
moving in large volume from the interior to
New York and unless the taking up of the
<Jovernmer.t deposits is to figure in the Satur
day bank statement the cash changes for the
week are likely to be email.
There were only slight changes In the prices
of iM.mdfi on a very small volume of business.

Several weeks ago the commission merchants
advised the farmers to hold back their new
Hay in order to allow the market to Improve.

merchant's advice, but he did this time, and
the good effects are already apparent. Hay
surprised its friends yesterday by advancing
o0c per ton all around, with a very firm feel
ing at the advance. Light receipts from now
on will keep the market firm, but If the farm
ers rush in a lot of new Hay the advance may
be lost. â¢

When Henry Austin Adams stepped
upon the stage at Metropolitan Hall last
night to deliver his lecture on "Cranks"
there was not a vacant seat in the house,
from the topmost back tier of the gal
lery to the front seats in the orchestra.
Many stood throughout. It was the last
of the series of lectures Mr. Adams has
been giving for the Catholic Truth So
ciety, and was in many respects the most
brilliant, fairly bristling with snappy epi
grams, all advanced in favor of the cranks
of the universe. After a few words of
humorous introduction by Chairman Law
lor Mr. Adams arose, but so great was the
demonstration that it was many minutes
before he could commence talking. The
lecture throughout was punctuated with
applause, called forth by the shafts of
satire the lecturer hurled at society and
conventional folks of all ''- classes, creeds
or occupations. Mr. Adams spoke in part
as follows: >
"You are not here to-night to listen to
a humorous lecture. It is to be a sad,
metaphysical study of those who have
been bold enough to break the bonds of
conventionality and strike out for them
selves. If you have tears prepare to shed
them now. I have made a deep study of
the crank, iso to-night you'll hear an ex
pert on them. . I love the crank. I be
lieve in him. I am here to defend him.
What la a crank? It is a name, we
wretched creatures of conventionality
fling at any one with original ideas who
is not afraid to proclaim them. The name
is a kinc'a attribute. It comes from a
simple force In mechanics. You cannot
get power from a row of wheels all hung
on the same dead center on an axle unless
there Is one hung differently.
"Cranks are eccentric powers; we
ordinary mortals concentric nothings.
Every page of history was turned by
some being you or I would call a crank.
Let me name pn<! â Christopher Columbus,
ne stuck to his crankiness. To that the
world owes a new chapter of possibilities,
which had their inception In the brain of
a crank. You know that every great thing
you've thought or done you've had to
think or do alone. The man who stands
alone and proclaims what he believes to
be the truth is a noble man; he's magnifi
centâhe's a crank! .
"We put the soft pedal on our children.
A girl at 15 is what God made her. At
25 she's social, she's lovely, she's cut,
dried and labeled.
"To be disliked is a proof, of greatness.
Stand apart and you'll get the name of
being a crank. Don't turn your children
Into hollow echoes of some other person
ality. Itself in turn a replica. Each one
is doine all he knows how to be a crank.
Tou do all you can to prevent him. I have
pleaded for the crank. When I am gone,
and am only a memory to you, I want
you to remember me as a crank!"
On June 20 Mr. Adams will lecture 6n
Sir Thomas Moore, at St. Paul's Hall.
Twenty-ninth and Church streets. On
June 25 he will talk of the "Twentieth
Century," â¢ under the auspices of Pioneer

WORDS OF PRAISE
FOR THE CRANK
BERKELEY. June 14.â "I expect to fill
vacancies after ray trip and not create
them."
This was the important and emphatic
statement made by President Benjamin
MÂ» Wheeler of the University of Califor
nia as he left for the East yesterday, and
it sets at rest all of the rumors and stor
ies of changes that he Is supposed to be
ready to make before the next term
opens. ; * .- 'Â¦'.,
Quite a number of vacancies have oc
curred Jn the university in the last year,
but few of which have been filled. There
is no commandant of the military depart
ment. Professor Frank Soule filling that
position temporarily. There Is a vacancy
in the German department, and this will
be filled by President Wheeler, which fact
probably gave rise to the groundless story
about the removal of Professor Putzker.
"There are a number of places which
will have to be filled before the fall term
opens," said President Wheeler, "and it
will be my business to secure the best
men for these places. It would not do any
good to name the men I have tn view.
There are a dozen proposed for each
place, and it would be useless to announce
the selections until a decision shall have
been reached by the candidates and the
regents. It ought to be enough to say
that I will get the best possible material
for these vacancies."
WHEELER WILL ONLY
FILL FACULTY VACANCIES
KILLED BECAUSE SHE
SECRETLY MARRIED
Thomas Bach Murders an Eighteen-
Year-Old Girl' and Commits
Suicide.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. June 14.â Moved by
strange jealousy of an adopted daughter,
Thomas Bach, aged 50. this afternoon

Bach, because she was secretly married
four weeks ago to Newt Thorne. He then
killed himself. The tragedy occurred at
the Bach farm, eleven miles from Louis
ville, on the Taylorville pike.
Mollie Bach was adopted twelve years
ago by the Bach family and given their
name. Thomas Bach, although a mar
ried man, was Intensely Jealous of the
girl and he told her, it is said, that he
would kill her if she ever got married.
To-day she showed him the license for
her marriage to Thorne. which had been
kept a secret until to-day. Bach imme
diately grabbed a pistol and started for
the girl. She darted through the front
door of the house, but he caught her and
shot her three times in the back. Pursu
ing her into the pard he shot her in the
left side. The girl fell to the ground and
Bach put the pistol to her temple and
shot her again. With the last bullet in the
pistol he ehot himself near the heart.

POOLROOM CIX5SED.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June 14.â Dan Slinkey
and Frank Payne had to close their wo
men's poolroom in the Favorite cafe at
Sausalito "Wednesday. President of the
Board of Town Trustees Adolph Sylva
visited the place and informed the pro
prietors that their operations as poolmen
would have to cease. Sylva ordered the
telephone taken out and in unmistakable
language impressed upon the proprietors
the fact that their place would have to
close as far as its connection with the
poolsellers was concerned. Realizing that
their dream of wealth had been dispelled,
Payne told Sylva that his telephone to
the poolrooms had cost him $7 50.
Sylva promptly handed him the money
out of his own pocket and told him to
fo his way and sin no more. Trustee
ylva. when Interviewed to-day, said that
there was a certain class of women who
frequented the poolrooms and who were
in the habit of sitting on the wharf and
being supplied with race news by a gang
of touts who became a nuisance by their
frequent trips to and from the poolrooms.

the Democratic State conventions in Cali
fornia, Missouri, Georgia and Vermont to

two-thirds necessary to nominate him.
OAKLAND, June 14.â Under stress of
long physical Buffering Major John
Lynch, father of John C. Lynch,
Collector of Internal Revenue at
San Francisco, committed suicide this
morning by shooting himself in the head
with a pistol. The aged man's body was
found in the library by his son at their
residence,. 1S45 University avenue. Berke
ley.
Major Lynch ended his life some time
between midnight and 6 o'clock this morn
ing. He retired early and gave no out
ward evidence that he contemplated death.
The other members of the family went to
bed a couple, of hours later and nothing
more was heard of the old gentleman.
About 7 o'clock this morning his son
arose and went to his father's room, as
usual. Collector Lynch found the room
vacant, and a few minutes later discov
ered the body of his father, fully clad,
tying on a sofa in the library. It is sup
posed that Major Lynch was seized with
a violent spasm of pain during the night
and ended his life to put a stop to un
bearable suffering.
The members of the family were fully
convinced that the long suffering Major
Lynch had undergone had destroyed his
reason. He was afflicted with heart trou
ble, which had caused him intense physi
cal distress. In a letter he wrote some
months ago to his children in contempla
tion of sudden possible death Major Lynch
referred to his physical aliments with con
siderable force. The letter is as follows:
My Dear Children: For some time I have
been afflicted with an Incurable malady which
Is often attended with paroxysms of most acute
pain. These attacks have recently been mow
frequent and seem to be Increasing In severity.
The symptoms attending them admonish me
that they may result in heart failure and
death with such suddenness as to prevent my
giving any directions as to the disposition to
be made of my body after death. I have no
fear of death. It is my desir* that when death
does come that it will come suddenly. I deem
It fit, therefore, to leave for your consideration
a few directions, or rather suggestions. In
that regard. While I have a strong desire that
the following directions be followed, yet they
are such a wide departure from the unwise
and vain display sanctioned by lonff /custom
that should the following of them/strictly
cause you pain or leave your motives open to
adverse criticism you will consider them mada
subject to such modification as your feellnw
and cense of propriety may determine.
Directions: Firstâ That my body be placed
In a plain redwood coffin without any orna
mentp of any kind and be cremated: that In
conveying the body to the place of cremation
a simple, suitable wagon be used, dispensing
with hearse and every form of display.
Secondâ That the ashes of my body be scat
tered over the grave of my wife In the cemetery
at Benicfa. and that no urn or other monument
mark the place where they are scattered.
Thirdâ That no crape or other insignia of
mourning be worn, such as are usual by near
relatives of the deceased. I have always con
sidered such an outward display as out of
place and never put It In practice, though I
have felt as keenly as any cne the loss of my
beloved dead. Affectionately,
JOHN LYJJCH.
To John C. and Mary F. Lynch.
Berkeley. Cal., January, 1900.
Major Lynch tad been an attorney for
many years. He was born in Ireland sev
enty-nve years ago. but while quite young
came to the United States with his
parents, who settled in Ohio. During the
civil war he served as major of the One
Hundred and Fourteenth Ohio Volunteer
Infantry. After the war and until 1SS7 his
home was in New Orleans. Then he re
moved to Benicia. and three years ago
took a home in Berkeley. His second
wife, who was Miss M. Atkins of Benicia.
died in 1S92. Major Lynch was a highly
respected member of the bar. His home
life was most happy and he was of a re
markably affectionate disposition. His
death was a severe ehock to the family
as well as to many friends. The funeral
will probably be held Saturday. So far as
cremation is concerned Major Lynch's de
sire concerning the disposition of his body
will be respected.

in use and he thought that 2300 arc lamps
would illuminate the city. His specifica

in some unimportant particulars.
The subject of a municipal water sys
tem was next considered by the commit

rived from Everett, Wash., early yester
day morning in tow of the tug Sea Lion.
The latter vessel has not been here for
:. early eight year?. In the old days she
end the Relief had many a brush on the
bay, and yesterday the old-timers were
discussing the famous race between the
rivals from the Farallones to Meiggs
Â¦wharf. Both vessels finished abreast of
each other off old lleigps wharf, but Cap
taSxa lilalr and Perrlman. the Merchants'
lixchange experts, assert that the/ Relief
had a good start, and therefore the Sea
2-ion won the race.
When completed the John 8. Kimball
will be the fcnest wooden steamer on the
Pacific. She is 2*0 fett long, 38 feet beam.
35 feet deep, while her displacement is 2&J0
tens. She will be schooner-rigged and her
Â¦cabin accommodations and Interior fit
ting's are to be of the best. It Is likely she
will make an excursion to the north, tak
ing in Cape Nome, Cape York and the
Siberian coast.
There have be^n a number of changes
in the Kimball Steamship Company dur
ing the last few days. John 8. Kimball
has retired from the active management
of the concern and Joseph Marsden is now
its president and Robert J. Tyson vice
president, while John H. Bullock con
tinues to be manager, treasurer and secre
tary. The new concern will control the
*teamers John S. Kimball, Albion, Aloha,
Sequoia, Noyo. Bessie K and the Fort
Bragg, now plying on the Sacramento
Jiiver.

NEWS FROM THE
OCEAN AND THE
WATER FRONT
Hawaii became a territory of the United
States yesterday and vessels coming from
and going to her ports will no longer be
restricted by the laws that govern the for
eign trade. Seventy-one steam and sail
ing vessels, some of them the largest that
are in the trans-Pacific trade, came under
the American flag and will receive Amer
ican registries as- fast as they arrive in
port. The aggregate gross tonnage of
these vessels is about 40,000 tons.
The pilots of San Francisco will lose
about $1500 per month through the provi
sions of the laws that now control Bhip
ping between this city and Hawaiian
ports. As there are twenty pilots this
means an average loss to each man of
$75 per month. Under tho new laws ves
sels now plyingr between this and
Hawaiian ports will be considered in the
coastwise trade. Masters who hold pilot's
certificates are not required in the coast
wise trade to accept pilots, unless they
express a wish to employ them, and are
not required to pay any sort of rates.
Every sailing ship master In the Hawaiian
trade holds a commission to pilot vessels
into this port, of which he wit! naturally
take advantage in the future, to the loss
of the State pilots. The rule will not ap
ply to steamships, for under the laws the
masters of steam vessels are not given
pilot's licenses. For some years the esti
mated pay of pilots has been about $400
per month, although some months their
pay has exceeded SltM) each.
American registries were issued under
the new law yesterday to the Hawaiian
barks Roderick Dhu and the Star of Bel
gium. The owners of these vessels have
been the first to take advantage of the
law. The American flag- will be hoisted
over the two vessels at sunrise this morn
ing, and they will hereafter be accorded
the same rights and privileges as are all
American vessels.- It will be no longer
necessary for them to enter and clear at
this port as in years gone by.
Shipping meji expect an Immediate
quickening of the freight business to the
islands. Ever since the passage of the
Hawaiian act freight for island ports has
been held up here to escape the payment
of the Hawaiian duties and^ there . will
now be a great rush to get this through.
Territorial Laws Went Into
Effect in the Islands

Percy Williams, a youthful burglar, who
has been operating in this city for the
past week, was captured yerterday after
noon by Detectives Dinan and Wren and
Policeman John Dougherty. In his pock
ets was found a miscellaneous assortment
of jewelry, which he had stolen from sev
eral residence? in the Western Addition.
Williams, who is only I'j years of age,
operated under thÂ«; guise of a peddler.
With a potato or a basket of strawberries
in his hand he would approach a private
dwelling, and after ringing the doorbell
end setting no response he would force
the door or a window with a Jimmy and
enter. On June 31 he broke into the resi
dence of William Dundas, 2218 Devisadero
street, during the absence of the family
and stole a gold watch and chain and a
pair of opera-glasses. A few days later
he entered the residence of Mrs. Powers,
at SOS Haight Ftreet. by prying open the
front window. There he got only a lady's
gold watch and a large quantity of dress
goods.
Williams sold mest of his booty to a
denizen of Bacon place.
Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday after
noon Detectives Dlnan and Wren, who
had been detailed by Captain of Detectives
Seymour to apprehend the burglar, saw
him walking along Bush street. They fol
lowed him to Bacon place, where he en
tered the house of the woman to whom he
had sold a portion of his plunder, i The de
tectives, who were accompanied by Officer
Dougherty, promptly entered the house
and placed Williams under arrest. He of
fered no resistance and was at once taken
to police headquarters. When searched a
pair of opera-glasses, an opal stud, a hand
mirror and a gold pin were found in his
possession.
Williams confessed that he had stolen
the articles from a house on Bush street,
near Powell. Ho will be formally booked
on several charges of burglary to-day.
Under the Guise of Peddler
He Entered Several
Residences.
BOY BURGLAR
CAUGHTWITH
HIS PLUNDER
OAKLAXD, June 14.â Amid a profusion of flowers and in the presence of
160 guests. Miss Alice Moffltt became to-day the bride of George Double
day of New York. The nuptial knot was tied by Rev. Father Prendergast
of St. Mary's Cathedral. San Francisco. The bride, a typical Gibson girl.
was charming in an exquisite gown of rich white satin, made with a very long
train and trimmed with full ruffles of tulle. The sleeves of the satin bodice were
or tulle and the bodice itself was almost concealed beneath a wide berthe of rare
old duchesse lace. The bride's veil was of tulle arid she carried a bouquet of
orchids.
The floral decorations were very elaborate. Potted plants and hanging bas
kets transformed the wide veranda of the Moffltt home into a tropical garden
and the drawing room fairly bloomed, garlands of flowers festooning the walls,
while the window seats and mantels were banked with choice and fragrant blos
â¢ some.
, A , weddin & breakfast followed th* marriage ceremony. The decorationB of the
bride s table were of tulle and American beauty roses. At this table were seated
Mr. and Mrs. Doubleday, Miss Lucy Moffitt, Miss Helen Wagner, Miss Chabot
Miss Kate Chabot, Mrs. Gardiner, Miss Vail. Miss Adelaide Murphy. Charles
Foster. James K. Moffltt. Will Horn. Peter Martin. Silas Palmer, W. H. Drown
and Edward Brayton. Mr. and Mrs. Doubleday will leave for the East on Fri
day.
The bride is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Moffltt. her father being a
member of the paper firm of Blake, Moffltt & Towne. She is one of the belles of
Oakland and the champion lady golf player of the coast. Mr. Doubleday is a
member of the publishing firm of Doubleday, McClure & Co. of New York
The recent order of the Police Commis
sioners calling upon a number of men on
the retired list who are drawing pensions
to appear before the examining physicians
of the department with the object of test
ing thc'.r fitness or unfitness for duty will
take effect in a few days. The order, of
course, only applies to three who had
been retired through physical disability
befcre serving the twenty years and being
c:.df-r â¬0 years of age.
Just before the previous board went out
<if office then? was a* rush of applicants to
be placed on the pension list and over
thirty were successful, a large number
not having served the allotted time and
being under age. Chief Sullivan on taking
office closely examined the list and was
fattsfied that several were not Justified in
drawing pensions and brought the mat
ter to the attention of the Commissioners,
but it was not till two weeks ago that
ection was taken on his suggestion.
There has been no desire to Interfere
wiih those who faithfully served the city
for only a little less than twenty years
although not CO years of age. but there
were others and speculation has been rife
p.s to who will be the men who will have,
to walk the rarpot and prove to the sat
isfaction of the examining physicians that
they &r<? physically unable to perform the
duties of a policeman.
The ones selected for the test are Lieu
tenant Bennett. Chief Clerk Wright. Ser
geants Price. Harper. Monaghan and Mel
ody and Policeman TynÂ«r. They were all
placed en the pension list under the phy
sical disability clause. Wright. Price.
Harper and Moraphan were retired re
cently 3nd they are all cnmparatlvelv
your.e men. with the possible exception of
>!or.aghan. Bennett was retired about
five years ago and went to Dawson City
during the Klondike rush and erg-aered in
m:r.ir.g enterprises. Melody was retired
tea years apo on the ground that he was
Incapacitated from duty through malaria
ard other causes. He has since been en-
Joytourvlt is claimed, good health. Police
men Tyner was only tour years in the de
partment when he was retired on a pen
sion through sickness. He bought a ranch
in Alameda County and has been working
it since. All those men will probably be
r*-<3 u*Â»sted to return to active duty or for
feit their pensions. The examination will
take place in a few dav*

Jarr.es Hurley's Hurricane beat A. L. Auetln's
Bonita won the midweek stake, beating
Silver Cloud In the final In a half-mlnuf?
run by a score of 8 to 1. The talent went
wrong on the race, forcing Bonita to the
short end and laying 5 to 3 against her
chances. The runner-up did some good
work in the stake and was put to a hard
test with Victor Queen in the third round.
In the fourth he won a long but not se
vere course from Rose of Tralee, and then
on the short end, at 1 to * beat Arab in
a bye. He did some clever work in this
run by taking advantage of Arab's trick
of laying off the game. Arab showed the
speed. Commander for a young dog
snowed well and promises with more ex
perience to get to the front. Daisy Dale
had two severe courses, one of which
lasted nearly three minutes. She did
some clever work and should not have
been allowed to go against Bonita. Blue
stone had his share of good work. He
was unsighted in his go with Admiral
Sampson, but joined Jn, outworked his
opponent and won by the kill.
The day's results, with Judge P. J.
Reilly's official scores, follow:
There vras a mild sensation yesterday
at Ingleslde Coursing Park when In tho
third tie MercilÂ«ss, entered in Joe Wat
klns' name, was >being led. or, rather,
dragged to the slips for the go with Rose
of Tralee. . Watklns has been out of the
city for some time and his kennel has
been in charge of A. C. Bradbury and H.
W. Bradshaw. The Watkins entries have
been suspected more than once of being
doped and- yesterday's performance
proved beyond a doubt that Merciless had
been made a .victim of the dirty practice,
presumably by its handlers. ;
The dog in passl-ng the grand stand
went through such crazy actions that
Judge Reilly ordered the trainer to take
it from the field, and though the play
on thp hound was heavy, the judge's ac
tion vas applauded by the bettors. Ac
tion will be taken against the dog's train
ers and If they are convicted It Is almost
a certainty that they will be ruled off of
all California fields.
NO LICENSES FOR THE
TWO ATHLETIC CLUBS
Supervisors Decline to Grant Them.
The Hebrew Orphans Must
Behave.
The Supervisors' Police Committee yes
terday refused to recommend a license for
a boxing contest this month to the Colum
bia Athletic Club. Chairman Reed stated
thAt the club managers had agreed to
comply with the rules supplementary to
the recent ordinance in order to secure
clean sport, but had persistently refused
to comply with the terms of their agree
ment. The club had also promised to dis
miss the Injunction now before the Supe
rior Court, but had neglected to do so. On
that score the committee agTeed that the
club could get no favors unless the contro
versy was settled. The National Club was
also denied a license until Judge Murasky
had rendered a decision In Us suit against
Tax Collector Scott.
A delegation of ladies appeared before
the committee regarding a petition that
the boys of the Hebrew Orphan Asylum
at the corner of Hayes and Devisadero
streets cease certain actions deemed ma
licious. It was stated that the boys threw
stones, broke windows and stole eggs in
the back yards of the neighbors' homes.
Superintendent Mowser of the orphanage
denied that the boys of the home were to
blame. It was ascertained that they ..were
allowed to play ball In a vacant lot back of
the home, written permission having been
granted by ex-Chief Lees, who owns the
lot. Mowser was requested to see that the
orphans kept out of the public streets
when playing and he promised that h<s
would do all In his power to compel the
good behavior of his charges.

ried Across the State Line.
From the foregoing views it follows that at
the time th* plaintiff and Joseph M. Wood en
tered into the contract in suit and at the time
they Intermarried in the State of Nevada, the
plaintiff possessed no legal capacity to marry
any person 'save her divorced and then living
husband. Smith, and as a corollaryâ the facts
consideredâ that the plaintiffs contract was
against the law and cannot be enforced.
It will be seen from this decision that,
while working the undoing of an ante
nuptial contract, the Judge has done no
more than refer to the traveling mar
riages, but In doing so he has dealt them
all a facer, and the contracting parties
are put In such a position that they may
have to call in the parson and have him
tie the knot over again.
There is. hope in the Supreme Court,
however, but there is not much, for love
Is a thing unknown in its decisions and
neglected 5n Its pleading, but it may be
that Dan Cupid may appear for plaintiff
and secure a decision favorable to those
he has got in such a fix.
The contract In suit was entered into in Cali
fornia and ls sought to be enforced In Califor
nia, Confessedly if the marriage of the plain
tiff and Joseph M. Wood had taken place, in
California it would have been void. Is the
ante-nuptial contract a valid contract merely
because the marriage was performed in an
other Jurisdiction?
Section 61. Civil ! Code, contains no penal
clause as stated, but it does contain words of
nullity and words which suspend the operation
of the decree: that is, words of personal disa
bility affecting the parties 'to the decree for the
full period of one year, and these, in my es
timation, cannot be avoided by merely Invok
ing another Jurisdiction for that purpose.
The language of the statute ls unambiguous
and but one interpretation is possible. The
law of domicile is Invoked and the law of domi
cile controls. No other Jurisdiction can relieve
against it. The plaintiff had full knowledge of
the law when she made the contract in ques
tion and, being herself the inhibited party, has
nothing to complain against in view of an ad
verse decision. This view would be different, of
course, if she were the Innocent party, but
she entered into the contract open-eyed. Ue
sldes counsel have shown that she is in fact
provided for as a residuary legatee of the tes
tator, Joseph M. Wood, and that a homestead
has been carved out of his estate and set apart
vlded for her as his wife. She made claim
to his estate for the amount of her con
tract money, and this was denied by Judge
Troutt, before whom the estate was being
probated, bo she sued before Judge Belch
er to compel the performance of the con
tract by Wood's executors. And now
Judge Belcher has not only refused to al
low her anything on the ante-nuptial con
tract, that he says was not followed by
a marriage, but he has kicked the whole
matrimonial bucket over and has spilled
hearts in every direction.
Irays Down the Law.
In his opinion Judge Belcher refers to
section 61 of the Civil Code, which ls the
one referring to the rights of divorced
persons to remarry, and which was
amended by the Legislature in 1S97 to pro
hibit their remarriage under any circum
stances until a year after the decree has
been granted. Proceeding on from this
reference he says:
The purpose of the section as amended by the
rider of 1S9T was to correct a great public evil
which had become too rifeâ to put a stop to
marriages within the period of an appeal from
the decree of divorce, which might be and
sometimes had been reversed, with great ecan
d&l to the parties who had married again. It
ls proper for the Btate to regulate marriages.
If this power to regulate did not exist there
would often be Indecent and Bhockinf? associa
tions of the eexee â even Incestuous and polyg
amous marriages could be contracted. Un
doubtedly it ls immoral and against public pol
icy that a divorced person 6hould be permitted
to contract a lecal marriage pending the right
of appeal and while it is yet uncertain what
the final ludement will be. The rider to the
section, therefore, 1b addressed to the effect
of the decreeâ something entirely within the
control of the law-making power and its effect
ls to regulate or establish the status of the par
ties to it during the period named.
The status of unmarried persons is controlled
by other statute*. Not all unmarried persons
may legally marry. Even when they are of
proper age unmarried persons are in some in
stances disabled from legally contracting mar
riage. In some Jurisdictions one or the other
party to an action for divorce ls, after decree,
perpetually disabled from contracting a legal
marriage. In this Jurisdiction both parties to a
divorce proceeding, after decree, are for the
full period of one year .therefrom, disabled
from marrying any other persons than them-
Eelve6. The divorcees may marry but within
the period of one year from the date of their
decree neither of them can legally marry any
save the other party to the divorce proceedings.
To be sure, there is no penalty attached to
disobedience of the law; nevertheless, the law,
though it will not punish the disobedience, will
not recognize in those who disobey it (whatever
their contract may be) any status other than
that which it fixes Itself, which, in the instance
of a divorced person marrying any other than
the person mentioned in the statute within the
period of disability, is that of an "unmarried
person."
Not a Xiegal Marriage.

The Judge, the Severed Couple and the Defeated God of Love.
(Altogether, since the law was passed, there have been over 800 couples from this State seeking
in Reno release from the one-year provision.) Â» .
tT in proper for the State to regulate marrlasres. . <
Undoubtedly it is Immoral and ngalnnt pnblic policy tliat a divorced person should be permitted *
to contract a leicnl marriage pending the right of appeal and while it is yet uncertain what the final .
Jadirment Trill be.
The purpose of the wectlon (61 of the Civil Code) was to put a atop to marriages within tne #
period of an appeal from the decree of divorce.
The Mntii* of nnmarrled persons ls controlled by other statutes. Not all unmarried persons may â¢
Ieffnllr marry. In thin Jurisdiction both purlieu to a divorce proceeding, after decree, are for the tall |
period of a year therefrom disabled from marrying any other perionx than themselves.
Section 01 contains words of nullity, and these cannot be avoided by merely invoking another .
Jurisdiction for that purpose. .
Â¦ The law ot domicile Is invoked and the law of domicile controls. No other Jurisdiction can re- .
lleve against It.
The plaintiff possessed no legal capacity to marry any person save her divorced and then living <
husband. . J
THERE will be broken hearts and
marriage bond* piled high In the
scrap heap If the Supreme Court
does not stand In with Dan Cupid |
and undo the marital mischief Judge
Boleher is working. He has declared from
the bench and in an opinion riled yester
day that "Reno" marriages are not what
they should beâ In fact are nothing at all,
and with a rubber stamp and a file mark
he has threatened to sever all hearts that
were made one acrofs the border and in
defiance of the divorce laws of this State.
And all because Mrs. Abble Rose Wood
wants some of the money left by the man
she thought was her husband.
Ever since the Legislature sought to
throw an extra obstacle in the way of
the loving: by putting a time limit on their
affections Nevada has been the refuge
of the lovelorn who cannot wait- The
code says a person divorced may marry
again only after a year has passed from
the time of the decree, but Nevada un
derstood how It was. She had ministers
herself with just as grood a marriagre cere
mony as could be found In California; so ;
the legally single sought her sands Jn
blocks of five, including the witness, and
ecored one on the home State. But now
Judge Belcher declares that California '
law will not stand for Fuch a proceeding;
that the fact that couples go over 10
Nevada especially to evade the law of Cal
ifornia is sufficient to nullify the min
ister's blessing: and though wedded the
travelers are singularly smgle-
Where Are They AtP
There are close to two thousand people
who, having been freed from one matri
monial tangle, plunged into another be
fore the season ooened and did so by
means of the friendly offices of the sister
State. According to the opinion of Judge
Belchfr they have not been married at
ell and in consequence their position is
an interesting: one. The central idea of
the opinion ls that the matrimonial emi
grants are domiciled in California; that
they peek Nevada for a special purpose,
and that one forbidden by the laws of
this: State â their domicile; that they never
give up their domicile in this State and
that they return and resume it as soon
as they have done what is forbidden hero.
What would be illegal here is illegal else
where, the Judge contends, when people
po elsewhere to evade home laws and then
return home Â¦when they have accom
plished their purpose.
Simply an Evasion of the Law.
It was contended In opposition to this
that a marriage legal in the place where
it is solemnized ls legal everywhere, but
Judge Belcher evidently takes into consid
eration the intent to evade the home law
as outweighing other contentions, for he
says in his opinion that under the laws of
their own State matrimonial pilgrims have
no right to marry any one except their
divorced spouses until a year after the de
cree of divorce. He does not consider
change of location any plea for legality
so long as they retain their residence in
California.
The case that has caused all this trouble
is a suit brought by Abble Rose Wood
against the estate of Joseph M. Wood to
recover $10,000, the amount specified as
consideration In an ante-nuptial contract,
in which she agreed to allow Wood to do
as he pleased with his property after mar
riage. This contract was made In Decem
ber. 1S97, five months after she had been
granted a divorce from Robert S. Smith.
The legal propriety of this State suggest
ed that 6he wait until the following July
before she linked hearts and hands with
"Wood, but they could not wait so long
with Reno bo rear, so they fled to the
Nevada town and were Bpliced on January
1. 1891 They did not know what legal pos
sibilities were in the ceremony.
Wood died in June. 1S98. a month before
the probation of the former Mrs. Smith

ments. Â¦
The attorneys for the petitioner opened
the argument In the morning. It was
contended that there had been no specific
assignment of part of the tax levy nor
of the money raised from It to any such
purpose as the establishment of a public
park to be known, as St. Mary's Park.
That being the case â¢ it * was claimed the
Treasurer had no power to form such a
fund arid no right to assign any- of the
public taxes to such a fund.
Harry. Creswell appeared for the,Audi
tor. He called attention to the fact that
by resolution of the Board of Supervlso.-s
the improvement was -provided for In the
tax levy by raising the rate 3 cents ana
33 mills, and that even If there had been
no special provision for such a fund stil!
the tax levy spoke for itself and it was
proof that, it .was. the Intention to form
such' a fund and that the money was
collected from the people for just such
a purpose and no other. â¢
