It is. however, a curious and regrettable
tact that the care which is so emphatic
ally f-xercised and mt firmly demanded by
th^ owners of the works is often disre
jrnni.-fi by the employes and frequently to
their lack of caution the explosions occur.
The owners have a large property at

operatives have their lives invested in the

Still, that they are conducted with the

âtwo parts of sulphur to one of niter.
This, with charcoal, constitutes black
gunpowder. Make each of the chemicals
into an acid and you have the basis for
all the higher explosives. Guncotton.
nitrtt*clycf rin. dynamite, blasting gelatin,
the lulminate of mercury, all these de
pend for i heir explosive power upon niter
and sulphur.
In the manufacture of all of these sev
eral substances explosions ore to
occur at every step of. thÂ«-> process. . In
the making of black powder, for instance,
the niter is triturated separately from the
sulphur, as is also the charcoal. 1 So long
as they are kept apart thÂ»re is no danger.
The niter does not ignite as readily as
the sulphur, and when it does it requires
the continuous presence of fire to compel
it to burn. It burns with a brilliant,
scintillating flame, going up with a sort
of spitting and sputter, like salt thrown
vti a. rej-noi prove. Tho nu.p..ur fuses,
melts, "throws out a mass of blue fumes;
then ignites into a yellow flame and curia
boldly upward, Jt is not until the two
chemicals unite, and the charcoal enters
to separate their atoms, that the danger
ri ally begins.
The process of powder-making is a mat
tor of mixing, and in the early stages of.
this mixing i danger lurks in the use of
charcoal which has been too recently
burnt. The, woods of which charcoal used
in powder-making are made arc alder,
dogwood and willow. TTscd directly after
burning, charcoal from these woods ab
sorbs oxygon from the air and so Â¦Â¦ pro
duces, spontaneous combustion. , Many
mills went into dust before this fact was
understood, and the makers were taught
in the school of catastrophe to let their
charcoal 'Ac a month or, more a'fter burn
ing and before using.
The ingredients are mixed in a barrel,
turning smootniy around and containing
a number- of bronze balls, which, by tho
agitation, grind the substances, and ;ifter
six or seven hours' stirring, during which'
the mass is moistened to prevent rising
of the temperature, it is turned into a
mortar, upon which two wheels revolve
Upon either end of an axle, supported by
a barjn the center. The axle turn3 around
And the wheels work over the circular,
disk, running with their broad tires over
the charge until it is mixed in thoroughly.
Notwithstanding this powder is wet, ex
plosions have -often taken place at this,
point. du.i to a rise in temperature. The
'mortars, are provided with tanks filled
vwith water sitting above them and when
'the slightest lift, of. an explosion occurs
jit is arranged that the flood shall fall into
the mortar, and the charge he "drowned."
/v. hereby the explosion shall at least be
from communicating itself to
'other stoves in the building.
) When tho charge is taken from the mor
tar is jammed into a box and subjected
(to a terrific squeeze in- a .hydraulic press,
the compression being 423 pounds' to the
'fquato . inch.' There- have been times
.when the bnx in which this charge is con
lined blow out at tho side. and the plun
Â¦ ger, of. tho press went up through the roof
along with the man who operated: it all.
â¢ caused by the oxidation of the charge
through high temperature. But if the
'mass g<?ts out of this box it is spread out
, and dried, then broken ' up on what: is
called a corning mill,, and finally, screen
icd.by which means the various size
grains of powder are separated. Follow
ingf this! the powder ot\ one mesh "is: put
into a barrel and turned rapidly in a pro
cess called glazing. A little powdered
plumbago is added and the grains . rub
bing, upon each other soon produce upon i
themselves a polish : which renders the
mass' brighter looking and preserves the '
grains from falling to dust in transp6rta-(
tion. yjn this giaziurr apparatus tne pow
der evolves a. very high degree of heat
and explosions are frequent. The ""explo
sion ot the Santa Cruz Powder Works,
which occurred on November 11, 1S90, was
from the glazing mill and it cleaned out
the entire, establishment," cutting "a hole
in the earth twenty feet deep.
The most remarkable of Â¦ .suostanos in
the explosive line Is guncotton. It belongs
to the nitrous order of higher explosives,
knowledge of which Is of such - rcocrt
date that prior to 1SG0 nothing was knov/n
of them. The wliole series came into ex
istence between the years 1SC0 and 1S.VJ.
In making guncotton si mixture of two
parts of strong | sulphuric acid with one
part of strong nitric acid is made, and
the cotton, which is ordinarily carded
waste cut into inch bits, is dipped into it.
It is allowed to remain in the solution for
abo'ut .twenty-four hours, when it is re-
moved and placed on a centrifugal mill
and whirled at a thousand revolutions n
minute in order to throw the acid out of
it. From this step on the efiort
is to get the acid out of it. It
is washed for hours through many
waters: it is boiled in steam, reduced to
pulp, put into a paper, machine ant
beaten; this flagellation continuing for
six hours, with water running through it
at all times. In order to further eliminate
th<i acid it is then treated -with alkali and
again washed. As a result of all this
cleansing the stuff does not present to

Professor Edward Thorndyke.. late of
the ' "Western. Reserve University, now in
structor in genetic psychology in the
Teachers' College. New York, has con
ducted a series of interesting experiments
which to prove that the mind does
not succumb reridily to fatigue, but that
in reality it is just as clear and active
after long hours of" work as at v the very
start.
"Mental fatigue," Â«says the professor,
"may. mean either' the : fact of incompe
tency to do certain mental work, or a feel
ing of incompoteney which parallels the
fact or the feeling or feelings denoted by
qur'eommon expressions 'mentally tired,"
'mentally exhausted.' = My experiments
have led me' to the conclusions, first, that
the^fact of incompetency is not What it
has been supposed to be: second, that
there is no pure feeling of lncompetency
which parallels, it and is its sign; that
consequently.. tho. mental. states ordinarily
designated by the' phraaea mentioned . are
not states made up of such a feeling'-ot"
incompetency, j but are very complex af
fairs; and third, that, these mental states
are in no sense parallels or measures of
the decrease in ability to do mental work.

Professor Thcrndyke has experimented
with himself and with other mind work

when the mind had .been at rest and
after protracted labor, and he finds that
the mind acts equally well under both
conditions. But the most interesting de

has drawn from a series of experiments

experts in old. movements who could re

to gold. The jewelers nowadays buy these

the value of the, cases, and except, in a

Most writers assert that the famous
apology was written after Savonarola had
received the brief of excommunication,
but Father O'Nell. from apparently well
authenticated sources, proves to the con
trarv, and in addition that after this the
Pope asked for safe escort to Rome for
Savonarola that he might answer the
charges against him. Unfortunately, bo
twfen the Florentine Embassailor and the
Signory of Florence the request was not
complied with, despite the great efforts
of the priest's friends.

In "The Rebel" H. B. Marrlot Watson,
the author of "The Princess Xenia." has
written a story of. events nnd personages
interested in the political intrigues which
later give rise to Monmouth's rebellion. .
: The. rebel is the Earl of Clicrwell. who
pursues a very stormy career, engaging
in plots against the succession of James,
Duke of York. At first Oherwell Is led on
â¢by alove of liberty and by a spirit of dis
content against prevailing conditions for
which his family was conspicuous. Later
the Duke of York gives an impetus to
Cberwell's inachinations against him and
adds personal rancor to impersonal oppo
sition by trying to win the affections of
the woman whom Chcrwell has made his
wife.

Intellectual sympathies, while the other,
who is a happy, ordinary fellow, touches
her sensibilities." The interest of the story
lies in the struggle of Joyce to determine
for which man she cares the more. The
result which follows Is one which usually
attends a conflict waged in a woman's
soul between the demands of the intellect
and the affections.

there between Herreros and Hottentots,
and which only ceased recently. The Her
reros are a stately and powerful
people, with, many Rood qualities, as
the German colonists know. They are
unusually intelligent, and forcipners who
look upon them as ignorant savage? very
soon find out their mistake. I,arpe herds
of cattle are owned by them. and. like the
Matabeles. they cherish the animals so
much that they allow them to die of old
ape rather than part with tiiem. Disease
ha? recently played havoc with their
herds, and a? a result even the wealthiest
among- them have become comparatively
poor.

they like best to take tare of cattle, nnd
the" colonists use them mostly for this
purpose. Missionaries have long been tfy

labor has not been hitherto very success

the belief is general that this exodus will
Dot be complete^ and will as a rule be

This belief is baFed on the assumption

that, as the Transvaal is bound to enjoy

Germany, many of them scttlinc at Little
Windhoek, about half an hours distance
from the capital: There they tilled tho
ground and. while some failed as farmers,
the majority prospered. Others made
their homes in the capital, which is a
truly imposing: place. It has a strong firt.
furnished with equally strong towers, and
it is also protected by a long and high
wall, which i.Â« specially fortified at the
four corner.-. To il-.e north are the work
shops, prison, police station, canteen and
residences of the Government officials,
and at some distance is the home of Ma
inr Leutwein. captain general and the
"principal representative of the German
fag. and if they wander to the cast they
win finÂ«1 that Portugal has as littlÂ» wel

where they will, they cannot find in t> 1 1
South Africa any lordless territory; they
cannot now. as in the old time, "trek" for
a few days and then establish their homes
in an unclaimed country. There is. how
ever, one place In which they will, it is
thought, strive to settle, and that is Ger
man Southwest Africa. An Inviting re
gion it is. and tfepecially to Boers. si:icÂ° it
is notaMy rich in pasture land. They
vroutd have to cross British Bfhuana
land in order to reach it. but a Journey of
this kind would have no terrors for them.
Yet it is practically certain that they
would not be welcomed in this Teutonic
settlement, and. in order 10 understand
clearly why even amonjr those Germans
they will probably be unable to flml
homes, some account of the colony is nec
essary.
Their distinctive ornaments are two heavy
iron rings, which are worn above the
knees, ai-.d their clothing consists of an
apion, a leather bodice studded with
pieces of ostrich egg shells or with small
knobs carved out of a sweet smelling root,
and a sort of mantle, which is < buttoned
in front. Around the neck and tipper arm
thev wear chains of pearls, and they
adorn thi-ir wrists with bracelets of strong
wire. Most extraordinary, however, is the
headgear which the married women wear.
It consists of a tlshtlj fitting cap. from
which protrude In various directions long,
curiously embroidered ears made of cow
hide. High above the head they rear
themselves, to the unbounded astonish
ment of the traveler who sees them for
the lirst time.
There are also Bushmen in this region,
nnd as a rule JhÂ«'ir only elothinp is some
thing like a bathing towel, made -of a
Jackal's skin. Only elderly persons who
have money wear in addition a leather
mantle. These natives still use primitive
weapons â namely, bows and poisoned ar
rows and assegais or javelins. A poor,
dejected race they are. owning, no cattle
and subsisting on wild fruits " and the
spoils of the chase. Quite different from
them are the yellow Hottentots, who live
to the south, and who are an eapy-srolner.
devil-may-care, lazy, drunken lot of peo
ple. Akin to these are the Khaus Hot
tentots, who made, trouble for the German
colony some years ago, under their leader.
Xicodcmus, but who "were quickly sub
dued and punished.
Now. this is the country to which the
emigrating Boers would naturally turn,
and yet It is clear that they would not be
allowed to retain their old independence
there any more than they would in the
Transvaal under the British. On this
point >Jajor K. von Francois, former rep
resentative of the German Government in
Southwest Africa, writes very clearly in
an article, which appears In the current
issue of "Die U'oche."- - -
"The Boer will not find independence
amonc us." he says, "tie must conform
to the will of thf German Government
just as he would have to obey the British
Government if he stayed at home.
Whether, then.. he will thrive better under
the German than under the British Gov
ernment is a Question which time alone
can answer-. It is probable that many
Boers will desire to emigrate to German
Southwest Africa, and it lskfor the Ger
man Government to decide whether it is
wl>e to pive them grants of land or not."
.Major Francois is decidedly of the opin
ion that it is not advisable.
"While I was in command in Southwest
Africa in 1S32," he continue*. "Count Pfeil.
representing the German Emigration So
ciety, asked me if I would sanction tho
admission of forty families of well-to-do
Boers who had 'trekked' near us and who
desired, to become members "of cur colony.
Count. PfeU'had tried hard to interest
German South Africans In the colony, out

Boers, t>n the other hand, desired to j"ln

country. They liked our pasture land and
bald that they knew forty lioer families
which would be willing to join us. I
weighed Count Pfeil'fl proposal carefully
and conscientiously, and the conclusion
nt which I arrived at v.as that it would
not be v/ell to admit the Boers as settlers.
I knew the many pood qualities of the
IJoers, and no one sympathizes with them
"lore than 1 do. There were 200 Boers In
"NamrJand, the district south of us. and I
frequently saw them at work, on their
farms and had an opportunity to study
their character. Furthermore. I traveled
through the Transvaal and the Orange
Free State in 1838, and I saw much of
Boer life and customs, and what 1 saw
simply convinced me that I was riprht in
refusing to admit LSocrs into our colony in
1!"KJ.
"Admirable is the patriarchal, pious life
of the Boers, and most praiseworthy are
the patience and courage with which they
have more than once faced enormous diffi
culties. A lover of peace is the Boer, and
also painstaking and industrious. In some
respects, then, he would prove a desirable
settled, and especially if it were necessary
to quickly develop a section of South Af
rica. I even ndmit that I would sooner
have had Boers as settlers than many of
those Germans who were eontinually
gronning over some little calamity anil
running to the authorities with their com
plaints. At the same time I saw clearly
that the Boers did not know verv much
about agriculture, and that they did not
make any strenuous efforts to add to their
knowledge. Moreover. I knew that among
tho half-breeds in Namaland there were
more people who could read and
write than there were aiminu the
Boers. Finally. I saw that the
Boers were extremely arrogant toward the
natives and were tiot Inclined to grant
them any rights. Naturally the natives
hate the Boors, and strong evidence of
thfs hatred was given when the rumor
rprr-ad in KÂ»2 that forty Boer families
had arked tu be admitted Into our colony.
The Wltbool and Herrero tribes were at
war with each other at the time, and yet
when thf>y hvard that Boera were likely
to com? they made peace and resolved to
fate the now p?ril tugcther.
"Tbe main ri-asnn, however, why I de
clined to' admit the Boers in ISM â and the
same reason holds good to-dayâ la becauso
our colony ' should consist of Germans
only. About l'M/H) farmers and as many
business men and artisans can find homes
in German Southwest Africa. If we ad
mit some Boors others will soon follow,
and. as they multiply quicklv, the Boer
figment in the colony will tend to become
ever more and more- preponderant. As a
result Germans, who may desire to b*Â»
cime settlors in later years, will not bÂ»
able to obtain homesteads. In the coun
try over which the German flap waves tn<9
Dutch language will then be spoken, sineÂ©
the K<-er dings firmly to his mother
tongue. One of the first conditions which
the Boers mentioned in l>03 was that they
be allowed to retain their native lan
guage."
Major VOU Francois concludes by saylns
that German Southwest Africa should re
main distinctly a German possession, and
that no encouragement should be jelven to
foreigners to settle thore. Evidently,
therefore, any Boers who may "trek"
there v.-Ill not rind it easy to obtain
homes; nay, the outlook is that the Ger
man authorities wiil not consent to admit
them as colonists. And. even if they
should consent, the Boers will bÂ«Â» obliged
to conform to the rules and mistoms ot
the country, so that any dream which
taey may have of retaining their old
independence will speedily be dissipated.
(in whÂ»re they will they will seÂ© some for
eiern flag wavif-.sr. and that flag they must
respect. More fortunate were their fath
ers, but then t'mes change and Africa la
no longer a lorfUess land."

"Oh, very well," said the Irishwoman

"Wt- suffer lefribly at tho thought that

"Oh! I am not bored," replied Daisy
."If I were not shut up inside four walls I
should even take a liking tor the soc!etv

Pirnitz told Daisy all the events of the
preceding day; the double visit paid by
Quignonnet, and the new contract. The
Irish woman made every effort to show
Interest in the matter, but the clear
sighted eyes of the apostle divined that
her. thoughts were nbsent when Germaine
was not the subject/; When the two
women took leave of one another tho
Irish wpman said to Pirnitz:
"If T am kept- here forget all about me

But almost immediately she thought:
"No I will say nothing. What is the
good? Every euort would be useless. Iho

done"
The Instinct of self-preservation, her de
sire for happiness and liberty, clamored
wlthiri her.
"What shall I become in the midst of
these ruins?'* -
Should she still fight and try to rebuild
upon the ruins?
"No, t no longer believe in all this. And
besides, I have done enough!"
It was her strong and clear conviction
that sne had given enough of herself to
the work; that she hart Kept. her bargain,
had paid her debt to Freiierique and to
Pirnliz.
"When the work is demolished my duty
is no longer here. I shall free myself and
go away, l swear It!" 'Â¦';'Â¦*
She repeated thi.s solemn vow to herself
several times, an. found in it n tranquil
energy that had 'deserted her for a long
time.
The bailiff*, whom they expected, did not
come during the whole of tho day that
followed Germaine's crime, nor even on
the second day. On the other hand, Tir
nitz received a visit from i\i. Quignunnet,
the stockbroker and deputy Mayor of- St.
diaries, lie came on behalf of M. Dur
amberty, and exhibited a power of attor
ney, signed by the manufacturer for tha
guarantee of his interests with regard to
the deposit. He was- polite; almost obse
quious. '
"I assure you, madam." he said to Pir

absence, "that M.'. Duramberty.is not ani
mated by any malevolent ln'tcntlons to

"It has not been made," replied Plrnltz.
"and. we are awaiting some step upon the

. Quignonnet said that he could not take
upon himself to make a definite reply until
he had consulted with M. Duramberty.

vidual Germalne's crime had nothing to
do with the discipline or the morality of
the school. In addition, the majority of
the pupils were orphans, or had been
abandoned by their families. Without ex
ception they all ranged themselves around
their mistresses, took sides with Daisy
and Germaine. After supper they were
called together in the meeting hall, where

"No adequate explanation of the facts
has yet been discovered, but it appears
certain that the crime is the deed of an
anarchist. The domiciliary visit - paid - to
the school In the Rue des .Vergers by M.
Courbaraud has led to the confiscation of

"Indeed? Well, if you can do anything

erique:"
"I will try. I promise you."
"I should like to say good-by to Pirnitz
and Lea."
Frederique thought for a moment.
"Lea Is very nervous at present." she
nald. "and I think It would be best to
spare her such a trial. "As for Pirnitz, I
will call her."
But Pirnitz had gone out a few mo
ments before the arrival of the Deputy
Procureur. the Judge d'Instruction and
the commissaries, who began to show a
little impatience over the delay.
"It Is quite time, mademoiselle." said
Cotirbaraud. half opening the door and
speaking rather roughly.
"I am coming." said Daisy.
"Could you not take Miss Craggs away
through the laboratory door which open's
on the Rue Delormo?" asked Frederique.
"If you like," replied Courbaraud.
One of the detectives was sent for the
cabs which had brought them all to the
school. The cabmen were told to go
around the buildings and await in the
Rue Delorme. Thus the departure of
Daisy, accompanied by the policemen,
passed almost unnotfeed.
They were in the month of June. Po
lltical news in ceneral was scarce. The
Chambre des Deputes at the end of the
session was getting rid of a few laws of
merely local interest. The crime in the
Rue du Collsee provided very tempting
food for curiosity. All ; the afternoon of
the day following the murder reporters
flowed to the Rue des Vergers. They
wanted details about Germaine, about
Daisy Craggs, and also about the organ
ization of the school and the mode of life
of the mistresses. Some of them carried
cameras slung over their shoulders And
manifested an Intention of using them to
photograph thn mistresses and the build
ings. Pirnitz. Frederique and Mile. Heur
teau opposed a firm resistance to this pro
fessional indiscretion. Mile. Heurteau
took her post in the gatekeeper's lodge to
receive the journalists, so that they would
not need to cnte'r the school.
The evening papera contained very .few
details. The Temps said: â¢
She kissed her two companions.
"Good-by. Heurteau. Good-by. Freder
ique. Do not be angry with us "any more
than you can help. Germaine Is hot re
sponsible, and as for me. really. I am only
guilty of having loved her too much."
An affectionate and powerful emotion op
pressed Frederique's heart. She took
Daisy in her arms and pressed her to her
bosom.
Krom that moment the representative?
of the law went about their work with
scant courtesy and almost in silence.
From tirre to time they asked a question
coldly. The researches in Daisy's room
naturally provided no fresh clew. They
discovered a number of insignitlcant pa
pers, notes of translations and literary
articles and a few photographs nf women.
They also confiscated Germaine'p case of
surgical instruments in the " laboratory.
When all this had been done Courbaraud
sa'd to the Irish woman:
"Will you please put on your hat and
come with us?"
"Wry well," said Daisy, simply. "Shall
I bo long?'
"I cannot say anything about that. It
will all depend upon the Juge d'lnstrue
tion. At any rate, take with you suf
licient clothes for two or three days."
Thfc detectives left Daisy alone in fier
room with Mile. Hourtrau and Frederique,
who began to comfort her.
"Oh." s;*!d the Irish woman, perfectly
calmly, "den't trouble about me. This is
not the first time In my life that I have
been in the same situation. I am not
frightened of prison, and. besides, it
seems to me that little Germalne will
have more confidence when she knows
thnt I am arrested also."
"I should have asked nothing â¢ bettei
then to leave Mile. Crapgs undisturbed,'
replied M. Courbaraud, "but the papen
whi<-h Vv - e have just confiscated lend t
certain color to the hypothesis that thÂ«
crime has a political origin. And, un
fortunately, most of these papers belong
to Mlic. Craggs."
"i'ou are golnrr to arrest her?" cr!e<?
Frederinue. "Why. what hay she done'.
She has had r.o hand In this."
Neither the Deputy l'roeureur nor the
Jute made any reply. They wer.t for a
rnorr.ent into the next room and conferred
with the Commissary.
"Mile. Craggs," paid M. Courbaraud, re
turning, "we are also compelled to make
a little inquiry into your affairs, and I do
not conceal from you that we shall prob
ably be compelled to arrest you."
"I said farewell to all those illusions a
long time ago as far as I am concerned,"
she said. "As for Germaine, who has
never crossed the Channel, how could she
take any interest in the matter other than
a mere theoretical or historical Interest?"
The operation was not a lonfj one. Ger
maine's wardrobe onl\ contained a few
garments, which were left, as well as her
hnen. after it had all been scrupulously
examined. Two portraits, one of Parnell,
the <-;ther of O'Conr.ell. liansirgr over the
mantelpiece, were confiscated. An inven
tory was taken of the library. It contained
a cumber of- recently published revolu
tionary pamphlets and also a collection
of Irish newspapers, dating from twenty
years before, in which Daisy Craggs'
name was mentioned frequently. In the
drawer of the writing desk they found
all Germaire"s correspondence, her diary
and several books, yellowed by age, eon
tainfrK lectures or notes for lectured elab
orated and drawn up by Daisy during the
Fenian period.
When questioned Daisy admitted having
written all this, but she denied having
given the documents to Gerraaine with the
object of converting her.
â¢-â¢Where la lt?7
Daisy did not reply. Frederique, realiz
ing: that any dissimulation wouiu be dan
gerous, spoke up:
"Germaine's Instruments are downstairs
in the laboratory, sir," she said. "You
may see them there."
"Ah? Thanks mademoiselle. We will
po for them in a short time. But for the
moment, as we cannot fret any informa
tion about the motive of the crime, we
will cast a rapid glance through the girl
Boubize's room. You said that it adjoins
Mme. Crr.frgs'? You m:'y come witn us
and witness the search."
did any relations exist between Germaine
Soubize and Sir James Bartlett?"
As Daisy hesitated before replying the
Juge d'Instruction urped her in his turn:
"Tell usall that you know, both In the in
terest of the accused pirl and in your
own. I "must warn you that we have al
ready taken the evidence of Lady Mary
Jackson. Sir James had just left her
house when he was struck down. This
lady declares that Germaine was in her
service for several months, and that she
met the Baronet at her house frequently.
Lady Mary Jack?on looks upon her as u
dangerous anarchist."
"It is quite true," replied Daisy, "that
Germaine acted as reader for Lady Wary
and met the Baronet at that period. But
there were no intimate relations between
her and Sir Jitines then; of that 1 am
sure, quite sure."
"This point is not quite clear." replied
the Deputy Procureur. "I don't know
whether you are aware that the accused
plrl appears to have been the object of
violence "
"What: Is It possible?" cried Daisy.
"Oh, the miserable scoundrels! But who
can have done such a monstrous thing?"
"Germaine Soubize refuses absolutely to
fjlve any explanation upon this point. And
in spite of what one reads in books and
newspapers It is not always possible for
a dot-tor to speak dee'dedly upon such a
delicate matter. We rely upon you for
some enlightenment. Tell us all you
know, we bep you."
"I'pon my soul and conscience, sir, I
know nothing about it. I have always
looked upon Germaine as a perfectly In
nocent child. I thought 1 knew every
thing of her life, and that life to me was
purity itself. Every one here thoupht as
1 do" auu will tell you the same thins-
You would receive exactly the same in
formation at the Maternity Hospital, and
particularly from Germaine's professor.
Dr. Bouchardon."
"Ah' by the way. she had studied at the
maternity: Lady Mary Jackson told us.
Did she practice?"
"No. As a matter of fact she had no
time." '<': -V
"Nevertheless, she must have kept her
surpical instruments close at handâ the
ca:-Â« that she had as a student?"
"I believe so. Yes, she had one."
"Sit down, please." said M. Courbaraud.
Krederique and Mile. Heurteau sat down
upon the bed. Daisy. Courbaraud, the
Juge d'ltiFtructlon and the commissaries
drew their chairs up to the table. The
Juge scribbled a few notes.
"Let me see." continued the Deputy
Proourcur. "Can you give us any clew
to the motives that may have led the girl
Soubize lo commit this crime?"
"Not one." replied Daisy.
"Has she ever s-poken to you of 'such a
project?"
"No, never."
"Did you notice anything abnormal
sbout her. in her bearing or htneuage,
y<-pterelay and the preceding days?"
"Yes. She had a violent hysterical at
tack the nijrht before. On the other hand.
she appeared very calm all yesterday.
Those ladies can bear witness to that."
Fredorlque and Mile. Heurteau ac
quiesced with a movement of their head8.
"Ah. ah!" said M. Courbaraud, "the girl
Boubire had a hysterical attack the niirht
before. Is Ehe subject to tits of that
kind?" ,. -
"Well, thf y were rather frequent at the
period of adolescence; in fact whr-n the

"Oh! that enigmatical wanton and
crafty smile last evcnl.ng while Plrnltz
was talking! I must warn Frederique."
persed, even were this Bchool to prosper
no longer,' the good seed wo have sown In
your hearts would not be lost.
So long as one ot your mistresses lives
you can always group yourselves around
her. And finally, even were you alone and
far from us I have faith that you will re
main -what we have made youâ little,
brave, upright, emancipated women.
. All Â¦ her -youthful auditors invaded . tna
platform in tears when Pirnitz finished
speaking. The humble little woman, with
pain-racked limbs, was surrounded, kissed
and caressed by that youthful crowd, sud
denly elevated by enthusiasm for a great
cause. The little ones were proud to be
treated as women as helpmates. Pirnlts
might have ordered them to expose them
selves to certain death at that moment
and. they 'Â¦ would have consented with all
the Joy of disciples. The mistresses anil
the assistants, won over by the same fer
vor,, fell into each other's arms. It was
really the loving communion of the cata
combs.-
Frederique. whose powerful organization
began to suffer from the effects of these
repcared shocks, could hardly restrain her
tears when so many little wasted arms
twlntd themselves around her, and ail
Chose little lips, . with their flowerlika
freshfless, sought hers. Lea. pale and,dry
eyed. could not resist the nervous emotion
of th* scene. She felt another wave of
abnegation and devotion for the work
now imperiled, and believed sincerely that
she was ready to sacrifice herself to Jt
heroically.
"No," she thought. "I will net be the
only, one among all these valiant creat
ures to betray it."
It was the supreme Impulse, the lart
flicker of an apostolic charity, which con
sumed all the faith and belief, all the en
thusiasm that had been Infused In her by
Pirnitz and Frederinue. All that mem
orable evening was brightened and
warmed by it. For the last time Lea fell
asleep an apostle, eager for martyrdom.
xiut when the early dawn awoke her on
the morrow, about 5 o'clock, she found In
her heart only the ashes of that ardent
name. Her lucid indifference terrified her.
*ne thought over the scene of the preced
ing evening.
â¢What an idle demonstration! Why play
â¢#i this way with our nerves!"
Sho had a keen presentiment of what
w'ould be the result.
â¢'This Bartlett affair will finish the
rt'ork. Our enemies will profit from the
scandal and drive us away. Besides, Mile.
Heurteau Is betraying us." .
Lea was certain of this treason although
she had.no evidence of it.
"Oh! if they will only declare that she
is m'ad!" cried Daisy, "they would not
convict her and I'll undertake to euro
her." .
"Yes. we must hope ;that they will de
cide she is not responsible for h^r acts.

in the words "dissolution of the nrhool"
were clearly specified. It wnn nuffich-nt
for at least two of the foundrcuf^B to re
main in the school for' the enturprlun to
be considered as in existence. Those
foundresses- were named encclflcnlly, Mile.

and Daisy. They dared not add O*r
maine's name. In case of the death of one
of their number the others wt<ro to olect
a member in her place, who would Imme
diately acquire the same rights.
Pirnitz had to leave before the end of
the committee meeting at which these
grave questions were decided. Hho had
been summoned to the St. Lazare Prison
at 3 o'clock. The authorization to visit
Daisyâ an authorization thnt had been re
fused upon the preceding days â had been
finally accorded her. She -was allowed to
talk freely with the Irish woman In tho
parlor. These two souls, each heroic after
its kind, comforted ono annthor and com
municated their .glowing ardor to each
other. Dalsv was only alarmed about
Germaine. Â¦ Pirnitz pave her all the news
she had gathered the preceding evening
at the prison hospital, where, however,
Â«he had not- been allowed to see the pris
oner. Germaine was not 111 In tho ordin
ary sense of the word. She ate well, slept
v.-el!. talked sensibly, except when ques
tioned about her crime. Upon such occa
sions she wandered in her speech and ut
tered revolutionary speeches.
This Inquiry was intrusted to an under
secretary of the Department of Primary
Instruction, a man named Roudier, the
very ono delegated by the Minister the
preceding year to preside at the inaugu
ration of the school. Roudier was pres
ent at tho lessons, audited the books,
questioned th,e mistresses and the pupils.
While this inquiry was being conducted
the Matin and a great number of the
Paris papers continued to publish sensa
tional articles. - They related nothing new,
but they attacked the Minister person
ally, accused him of making a compact
with socialists, anarchists and "interna
tionalists." Roudier was personally de
nounced as a secret accomplice of the
feminist group. ..From that moment, be
ing very timorous and alarmed by these
attacks, he increased the severity of his
report, harped upon the lack of order in
the method of instruction which was so
little In conformity with the Spirit of the
university, and upon the peril of allow
ing an institution to continue over which
the avowed object of the mistress was to
prevent any official supervision. He cor
roborated the report that there existed a
so-called hygienic course in which the
care to be given to newly born infants
was taught, of a laboratory fitted up for
lessons in chemistry and obstetrical anat
omy. In reality this "laboratory" consist
ed., of .Germalne's case of surgical Instru
ments, already seized by the police.
This report was secretly drawn up by
Roudier while to all appearance he com
mended the excellent order, discipline and
ingenious methods of instruction of tho
pchool. This masterpiece of hypocrisy
mid systematically tvil interpretation waa
transmitted to the Department of Prl-
"Such is the School of Arts for Women
âopen rebellion against the government,
for they refused to permit the munictpal
authorities to exercise any right of super
vision and a primary Inspector was even
insulted and driven away; a system of In
struction that displays antSpatriotic. cos
mopolitan and atheistic tendencies; Im
modesty in language and in education,
and habitual immorality among pupils
and mistresses.
"What is the Minister of Public In
struction waiting for before smoking out
this nest of wasps? Or. rather, what
mysterious protection, after such Indis
putable scandals, is it that still confides
innocent children to a group of adventur
esses and mad women, among whom pas
sion is carried to the pitch of debauch and
madness to murder?"
Excited by these, "revelations," report
ers again besieged the school. By Mile.
Heurteau's advice they were refused ad
mittance* Disdain was the only reply to
such calumnies. But the effect of the
campaign so violently opened was not
long In making itself felt. A preliminary
note sent out by the Agence Havas an
nounced that a Deputy of the Right in
tended to interpellate the Minister of In
struction about the "Scandals of St.
Charles." A second note Informed the
public that this interpellation had been
postponed, the Minister having ordered,
upon his own initiative, an official inquiry
at the School of Arta for Women. Â¦
"Nevertheless, the anti-masculine doc
trines of the foundresses were not Inflex
ible. One of them. Mile. D. H.. left the
fold in the company of an ordinary car
penter who had vlsired the school to make
some repairs. As for the young sage
femme who taught the maternity class,
traces of her misconduct were discovered
the day she whs arrested.
Â¦ "This." said one of the writers, "is a
sentimental feminism that our old-fash
ioned ideas refuse to accept.
"This hideous immodesty." added the
Matin, "not only characterized the doc
trines but also the morals of the school.'
Among the mistresses en the one hand
and the. mistresses and pupils on the other
every encouragement was given to affec
tion of a nature upon which it is well not
to insist.
"However, as the investigating official
has discovered nothing, or has no; wished
to discover anything, we shall publish the
iirst results ot our inquiries to-morrow.
This note was reproduced by all the
papers and reawakened curiosity. The
frontier incident had been disposed or.
All fear of war had been dissipated.
Space was once more at the disposal of
the papers for the record of daily life.
The revelations which the Matin began
to publish next day and continued upon
the following days were commented upon
by the entire press.
The foundresses of the school easily di
vined who inspired these comments. Al
though the tone was different, although
the articles were manifestly written Dy
a different hand, it was easy to recognize
in them the spirit of the "Semaine de St.
Charies." An the accusations formerly
made against the school were brought up
again, and this time were used with more
technical skill. .
Speaking broadly, the substance of the
charges was as follows:
â¢*A group of cosmopolitan women, dis
guising under the r.ame>of feminism the
ories of a radical anarchy, succeeded in
winning over to their side a paralyzed and
half-crazy old lady, and extorted from her
the money necessary to found a school
wherein tney couid teach and apply their
doctrines. They were carefu. to recruit
their pupils amung orphans, so as to ex
orcise an untramrAeled domination over
them. They glorified in a complete ath
eism. The pupil3 were forbidden to utter
or wri'e the words God. Providence, the
soul, etc. Certain of the classes were
well conducted, for the teachers were not
larking in intelligence. But. in addition
to an absolute lack of method, a contempt
ior all moral principle, and without dwell
ing ui-on the leaven of anarchy cast into
youthful m<nds the impudicity of the edu
cation giver, was simply terrible. For
example, a certificated sage femme gave
a course of lessons In which all the mys
teries of physical love nnd maternity were
laid bare before girls of lo, 12 and H years
of age!
"The profc?3or of this abominable class
was Germaine Soubize, the young woman
who assassinated Sir James Bartlett witn
a lancet!
"We have serious reasons to believe
that these conc.usions are quite opposed
to the facts. When the ofheial inquiry
l:ar been in progress wÂ« have conducted
one of our own. It has disclosed matter*
of such gravity that we nave postponed
their puolication. believing tnat they
couid not escape the attention of the Ju^e
d'Instruction, ar.d. tnerefore, that ther-j
was no reason for us to usurp the func
tions of justice.
Moyond the walls of the school a. calm

â¢if tho arrest. Isonn of the pupils had left.
Klnnnclnl embarrassments had been effec
tively warded oft by means of the recent
nrrnrigemcnt. Tho tragedy in tho Rue du
Colifea would apparently end in the In
r urc<Tutlon ; of Germaine in a madhouse.
KvÂ«n tho papers hardly referred to the
iifTnlr. A frontier Incident, one of the
thousand rumors of war which â¢ have
nlarmt-d Europe without cause from lfTa
to tho twentieth century, had turned pub
lic curiosity In another direction. Kncour

quo and Daisy plucked up cournse. There
was only Lea. who, although ahe did not
eonudo tho eecret of her thoughts to any
ono, felt her presentiments of approaching
ruin Htrengthencd. And her resolution to
free herself amid the ruin was confirmed
"When the work has been destroyed vve

She was sure of it. and since she had
felt this certainty the only lived in the
future. She went through her customary
duties, gave her drawing and painting
le.Â«flons. took part In the conversations
with the pupils and mistresses, but at the
same time she mentally organized her
plan for the inevitable morrow.
"I will go away without saying any
thing, without speaking of my projects to
Frederique. I snnuld only pain her, and
perhaps we should both allow ' irreparable
words to escape our lips. A letter will D3
best."
Like a captive she arranged all the de
tails of her escape beforehand.
"I will go to London first and ask for
Gf-org's present address at Appletree
Yard. If they do not know it I will aslc
ilme. Sanz."
All this active planning was hidden un
der a tranquil exterior. Neither J'reci
trique ncr Pirnitz divined it. The deter
mination to free hersHf had hhed Lea
with calm, and at the same time had
given her strength to dissimulate.
Exactly eleven days after Germaine s
arrest, a few rather enigmatical lines were
published in the Matin. They were to the
following effect:
THK RUE DU COLISKE AFFAIR.
"Our readers cannot have forgotten tne

The Minister replied that measures Mail
already been taken by a decree signed
that very day he had completely reorgan
ized the School of St. Charles, had attrib
uted it to the municipality under the su
pervision of the State. The present di
rectresses would be dismissed, with on*
exception a very honorable person, for
merly in the service of the university, and
who had always opposed the excesses of
the so-called feminist instruction. She.
therefore, could be relied upon. The ap
propriation of the plate and buildings was
facilitated by the clauses of a contract
between the "foundresses and the propri
etor of the land, who was in complete
agreement with the Government. There
was therefore no question of the spolia
tion of the foundresses. They would re
enter into possession o? a certain deposit,
and fcr a year the State would pay them
fifteen hundred francs each as salary.
These explanations did not appear very
clear to Parliament, but the incident had
been arranged beforehand, like a comedy,
and the Minister was certain that his ac
tion would be approved. A deputy of the
Riant thought the moment opportune to
make an attack, and succeeded in insur
ing a great triumph for the Cabinet. Hw
proposed an amendment ."blaming the
carelessness of the Government with re
gard to an atheistic and anarchical
school"â and the amendment was rejected
by an Immense majority.
No one took the trouble to notlfv dlrect
lv Pirnitz, Frederique. Lea and Daisy of
their dismissal. In the eyes of the repre
sentatives of the Government they were
already outside the ban of social life.
Simply because they had tried to live and
prosper without the help of man. man hart

them like feeble pariahs. The Govern

Immediately called asi extraordinary com

Daisy and Lea. It was 6 o'clock in tho
evening, the very moment at which the
sitting of the Chamber ended. When tha
Ministerial letter had been read, amid
profound silence. Daisy said:
"Heurteau; you have betrayed us!
The former teacher protested energetic
ally :
"How can you think that I h.ive had
anything to do with the decree that has
destroyed us? I have not spoken to tho
Minister since the day we obtained his
authorization to open the school. I nav<Â»
never written to him or communicated
with him. even through intermediaries.
As for Roudier, you saw him at work
here, as I did. and just as I* did. you
thought him favorably disposed toward
us."
"Heurteau. you have betrayed us.
Daisy repeated. "I am certain of It to
day. You have worked secretly against
the school ever since its foundation. I
felt itâ I knew it. We all felt it, did wo
not. Frederique?"
Fredertque acquiesced with a movement
of her head. Mile. Heurteau. without los
ing her self-possession, renlled:
"I forgive you. Daisy; I forgive you all.
You are dismayed and misfortune makes
you unjust. If you had listened to me.
quite recently, thia catastrophe would
have been spared the school. I did not
succeed in saving it. In reality, it is I
who should reproach you. Dut, 1 repeat.
I understand your anger and I forgive

PirnitJ? made a movement of negation:
"No. Henrteau. we shall never come
back here."
â¢ "What? You also. Romaine? You. srÂ»
Just condemn me also? Wfcnt have I
done to youâ what have I done? I swear
I do not know what is responsible for my

"Probably. But you have manager! to

Besides, what Is the ustÂ« of recrimina
tions* You will settle the matter with
vour conscience. You had your own Ideas;

She looked at the former teacher for a
moment fixedly, a"d in her gaze there wan
a reproach so full of pain nmi so noblo

She blushed crimson and tear3 rose to her
eyes. '
"Come." said Plrnltz to the two sister*
and Daisy.

led Daisy. Frederique and Lea to her own

still convinced that Koudier was really
devoted to their cause and ready .to de

to refute all calumny and to enable them
to take legal action to confound their
calumniators.
By a common effect of admlnistrativo
cowardice the campaign in the press
against the school exercised an i mnuenco
not only upon the Minister of Public In
'struction but also upon the Juge who
was investigating the .Bartlett affair.
Anxious to avoid annoyance from any*

The violence of wnich Germaine had

that they had seen the young girl roam

policeman declared that ahe had lookeu

spontaneously affirmed that he hud sat on

The evolution of the yacht here Is tne
same as elsewhere in the United Stat*3.
"We commenced with the skimming-d'.feh
type of low-sided, wide boats with large
sails, but soon found they would rot feo
for the strong winds and heavy seas of
the lower bay. Gradually the boats were
given more tieadrise and more freeboar.d,
being thus deeper anÂ«l higher sided. The
local yachtsmen had to reduce sail area to
conform to the strength of the summer
winds, which are much heavier than In
the East. The spars and gear have also

speaking, working sails answer every pur

twenty to twenty-five miles an hour, ani
the big sails u.^ed by Eastern yachts could
not be handled here under such circum

It was finally decided to build an an
other clubhouse, this time away from the
city. After lengthy discussion a commit

and report to the- club. The names

result of this was a "split" and the
formation of the Pacific Yacht
Club, with a house at Old Sausa

its house at New Sausalito. This
was. an unfortunate thing for the
yachting Interests of the bay, since
there were not yachts enough to
form two clubs and the rivalry
carried on as It was gave the sport
no advantage. The Pacifies made
the same mistake the original San

too many life members; had to be
"reorganized" many times, were

not fall to be remarked by the most hurried visitor,
while there is noting else in all the great show which
reproduces so successfully on paper. The person miles
away, who 3ees only tha pictures of "Old Pari*." may
appreciate It almost as thoroughly as ho who sees
the real thins. It is in reality a plctura executed In
wood and stone with breathing persons instead of
painted or.es. Its first mission was to be a picture:
to llvo and to breathe were secondary. Consequently
lie who looks appreciatively at the designs in color
muv receive almost a3 much of the spirit of "Old
Paris" rh he who Bees the thing itself. Indeed, there
are disillusions !n the real thing which do not exist
In the pictures. The almost unavoidable presence of

horses; the CaJifornlan best of all.
THERE can't be a better horse," I am
sure, than our American animal.
These are some of the good things
about him:
He can stand great hardships. The wild
horses of our Western plains. are used to
them. They know how to make their own
living well enough, and I don't know but
they would rather keep on making it. At
any rate, they act about that way when
a man tries to break them.
Our Western horses are among tho
fiercest animals ln^he world, and it takes
a man who has the instinct for ii and thÂ«s
training, too. to- handle them. Take a
wild, frightened, savage little horse that
has galloped wherever he chose all hia
life and has never felt a man on his back;
âwell, there is nothing easy about tha
Job of breaklns him. A man must be sure,
in the first place, that he ia master: In
the second place, he must make his horse
sure of it. Look square at him and havo
a clear understanding, lie will recognize
â¢a steady eye as quickly as a" man will.
This .done, a ff.Ir start is made. The next
thlng'is to follow that up. Strength and
firmness and kindnes will win in the end
all provided that you "know how."
For this work with the cattle our men
seem to prefer the small California
horses, although we have some from Ne
vada.' I have ridden .as a vaquero In Ne- .
vada and Arizona, as well as In this
State, and I like all native Western.
What Seorge jasper
Has to Say About
the Cattle Horse.
You see that a hor>Â«e must be very
ne vrly perfect to come up to all Â»ho re
quirempnis. And the native American is*
the one to do it. I never realized this so
forcibly ns when our animals were?
brought into contrast with the little Fili
pino nativesâ not much more than'4 hand*
high, and as quarrelsome an il< gs. Dicln'c
I say. that everything American was tha
best?
For artillery horses the rcTiisites arÂ»Â»
similar, thÂ» main (lifferences being in re
gard to height and weight.
-Head and ears should be small: fore*
hrail broad: eyes lar^e and prominent;
vision perfect: shoulders .Ions: and slop
ing well back; chest full, broad and deep;
fore-leps straljrht and standing well ua
r.er: back short and straight."
I'R native Western horse, trained
{[ Inn our Western ranches, is the
\_j/]inrsc tor polo. For all the uses of
the game there is no better pony to
be found. And of nil the Western States
California has furnished the greatest fj
number of gnod polo ponies, with a few
notable exceptions.
Polo men do not. as a rule, go in for
breeding. If the speed, of a bred pony
could be united .with the reining qualities
of the cattle horse, then a perfect polo!
pony. would be found. But the bred horse
usually wants to run. and t^at spoils the
game. He must be level headed or he is
wdrthjess. . ' ' : ' 'Â¦
The small California cattle horse la thr
mount for a polo man. ' Prom his carliesl
long-legged >colthood he has been pui
through such a schooling in reining and
turning as no other horse knows He 1;
"cattle *reined." He is hardy, intelligent
and spirited. '.;
A polopony Is chosen' by many tests. â¢'
aT.e height- 1 trait is 14, hands'2 inches,
and' the .pony may 'bo! of any - r size.' under
u.ls provided he be heavy enough forJihef
game. Heavy ana not coarse is the com
bination, sought. Weight is needed in
' bumping. 'Â¦ ) t may .vary.- uf course, accord
ing to .the size of the rider, but in any
case, it is worth while, for a heavy man
must ride what is! called a. ."weight car- '
rier";. and a light; man want3 "a heavy
liOTse.
-. Speed is another requisite, and the ston
ping and starting and turning.qualitiea;
must be looked to. ;;A first-class polo pony
can : on next to nothing.- Coolness
counts. A horse Is always preferred to a
mare, for' his nerves 'are steadier, . and
; that meana much in the excitement of the
game./
: Competition Is Jncreaslhg so Â¦ much, that
the standard of polo ponies has been
raised as much as 30 per cent in the past â¢'.
â¢ year. This comes of the weeding out pro-
As for the riderâ he la another consfder-

"It must be between 13U and 15 handa
high; in weight, from 9G0 to 1150 pounds;

This Is part of what the United States
army regulations for 1S03 say about tha
requisites of the cavalry horses:
On the other hand, a thoroughbred Is
out of the Question. He Is too high struts
a horse to stand the nerve strain of bat
tie. Something more phlegmatic Is
wanted.
Broncos, or "broncs." as our boys call
them, are not used often, because they
aro treacherous. Otherwise they wouM
ne good material, for they have great en
durance and intelligence. But one. never
knows when a bronco is really broken.
You may think that you have him under
perfect control, when suddenly he be
comes as wildly unmanageable as If ha
had never felt the bit. And such per
formances won't do In the army. A cav
alryman Â¦ has no time to discipline hia
horse on the battlefield.
DO I think the American Is th<Â» best
cavalry horse there is? If every
thing American is not Â«.he best, let
somebody show a t better.
The United States cavalry recruits its
lorses from the plains of our Mlddla
Hates, and for the simple reason that

LONDON, May 27.â Spenser Wilkin
son, reviewing the situation at the
seat of war in South Africa for the
Associated Press, says:
"Lord Roberts Is keeping a tight
hand on all telegrams in order not to disÂ«
close his moves. After occupying Rhenos
ter he pushed his left wing jtt once toward
Parys. where the Vaal River was crossed
on Thursday. The whole army seems to
have changed its direction to the left, as
General Hamilton's original right wing
was to-day at Boschbank, half way from ,
Parys to the railroad bridge at Viljoena,
Drift, which is being watched by Roberts
scouts.
"General Hamilton probably crossed the
Vaal to-day, assisted, if necessary, "by a
march up the river of the force that
crossed at Parys. The whole force prob
ably will be across the Vaal by Sunday
afternoon. Johannesburg then will be two
marches distant.
"I suppose that Lord Roberts will push
on General Hamilton to turn the Boers,
while Generals ' Tucker and Pole-Carew
will attack in front.
"The Boers, as usual, must either be en
veloped or go. Very special efforts will
be made to cut off their retreat, as Lord
Roberts Is now determined to capture
them if possible. He relies fully on Ian
Hamilton, whose combination of fire and
prudence justifies every confidence.
"If the Boers escape toward Pretoria
Lord Roberts will probably follow swiftly
and be at Pretoria in less than a week.
"The Boers say they have retaken Heil
bron. General Roberts will neglect that,
but will guard the railway, which I think
he will not wait to repair before going to
Pretoria,
"General Buller at Laings Nek is eight*
or nine marches from Johannesburg, sup
posing that the road is clear. Roberts'
advance must make the Boers at Volks
rust uneasy, and so will facilitate Buller's
advance, â¢
"General Hunter when a? Mafeklng will
be eleven marches from Pretoria, and it is
impracticable therefore rfor the Boer9 to
make any serious resistance at Pretoria,
where to wait would mean to be hemmed
in between three British, armies.
"The Boer plan is to* retreat to the
Lydenburg hills, which would postpone
but not avert the catastrophe; but the
condition and strength of the Boer forces
after the coming week's operations re
main to be seeen. Possibly the* difficulty
b- supply may compel General Roberts
to pause on *the Vaal and repair the rail
vsay, thus giving time to General Buller
and General Hunter to invade the Trans
vaal. I fancy, however, that Lord Rob
erts will prefer the bolder course and
try to end this war right now.
"Many points in ihe recent operations
are obscure. Thus, the long pause of
Genera! Lyttleton at Sundays Kiver" and
the subsequent 'silence suggests that he
may co-operate with General Kundle to
finish the Free Staters' resistance. There
has been no distinct report from General
Mcthuen since that from Hoopstad. He
probably crossed the Vaal near Parys.
"Lord Roberts marches in a very broad
front, with his cavalry wings thrown for ;
ward. General Buller probably cannot
adopt the same plan in the rugjjed coun
try of Northern Natal, but, once Buller
Is up In the hills or the table lands of the
Transvaal, he will be able to spread out
and move rapidly. .
"Lord Roberts has a wonderful power
of picking a special man for every special
work. Ian Hamilton, the brilliant gen
eral, was shot to pieces at Majuba in the
first' BOer war. Since then he has made a
great mark in training the Indian army to
ehoot 'Straight, and was himself one of
tho best officers In India. Another tried
and able man is Sir William Nicholson,'
who was chief of staff to General . Lock
hard in Tirah.' He is now running all the
| transport for ' General Roberts, I whose
army since IV reached Bloemfonteln" has
been weir supplied. Nothing shows-, the
great commander more.Hhan his;' finding
his men and giving them free hand. Rob
erts himself has incomparable dash and
boldness, coupled with great circumspec
tion; hence . I expect- rapid, strides, now
that the' crisis is at hand."

"A "T EW YORK. May 2o.â Actual developments in connection wfth the failed
|\ I J firm of Price. McCormick & Co. to-day were meaner, although a report
I \i was current in Wall street that the liabilities were mere nearly $16,000,000
J than $13,000,000. No one hazards a guess at the extent of the assets.
though the feeling in the street is that If the house pays fifty cents on the
doll.'rr it will do better than is expected.
The assignee, Mr. Curtis, was asked as to the tr\:th of the statement that' the
firm's liabilities might prove to be in excess of $13,000,000. He would not deny
that this might prove to be the case, but declined to commit himself.
W. W. Price said to-day that he did not know that' any cable message had
been sent to George Crocker, special partner of the firm, now in Rome, asking
him to retract his remarks about the speculations of one of the members of the
firm.
"This has all been gone over in the newspapers." said he, "and it Is gener
ally unders'tood that the failure of the iirm is due to the speculation of one of the
members. I thought everybody knew that. What Is the good of wasting tima
over cable messages? Settling with creditors is the important thing on hand. It
Is the same old Wall street game, and wo are up against it."
R. M. Stuart-Wortley. member of the firm, w-ho is a son-in-law of Admiral
Schiey, returned from a European trip to-day on the steamer ' Lucanla of the
Cunard line. When seen on the pier he positively refused to discuss the affairs
of his firm or to comment on the caur.es which had led to the suspension.
"You probably know more than I do on the subject." he remarked*. "The
newspapers seem to have given every possible fact and I have not yet been able
to get any other information. Of course, it was a surprise to me."
When Mr. Stuart- Wortley left for England he was a wealthy man. He pro
ceeded immediately from the pier to his office, where for a tlnie he was closeted
with Mr. Price and the assignee. I'pon leaving the office he appeared much
downcast, but he had nothing to say.
Reports were circulated in Wall street during the day that the firm. If it
resumed, would do so without the presence in it again of one of its members.
The person referred to was understood to be Mr. Price, who is also understood to
be the partner to whom reference was made by Mr. Crocker.
The matter attracted but little attention, as Wall street concerns itself less
with the composition of a tlrm than the settlement of obligations, and the firm's
settlement. In the mind of conservative commission houses, is regarded as still a
long way off.
In the same connection, it was said that there was nothing more in the plan
proposed to allow customers to take up their stocks. This is the course pursued,
so several stock exchange commission houses stated, in all stock exchange fail
ures where loans are reasonably margined. The only surprise* manifested was
over the apparent anomaly of the firm being solvent in its stock transactions and
insolvent in cotton. Â»
The capitalization of the firm is said to have been a million and a half dol
lars, instead of a million, as originally named. Of this sum T. II. Price had $300,
000; George Crocker" s special interest was $500,000," and the interests of Messrs.
McCormick and Stuart- Wortley were $250,000 each. Walter W. Price's Interest was
said to have been nominal.
The firm's loans from the local banks are said to aggregate about $4,000,000.
Nearly all of them were time loans, and were made during the period when in
terest rates were higher and stock values were lower than they are now. It la
pointed out that in view of this fact the banks probably will continue to hold
on to their collateral until maturity. . ,
' Theodore H. Price, in reply to the alleged statement of his special partner.
George Crocker, that his (Mr. Price's) speculations had ruined the firm, said to
day: "In the first place, I doubt very much its veracity, but I have cabled to Sir.
Crocker requesting that he withdraw it."

CHICAGO INVADED
BY ARMED FORCE
Captain Strceter's Minions Ta^e
Possession of "District of LaKe .
Michigan" at Midnight.
After Landing From a "Transport" the "Troops"
AlaKe a Display of Gatling Guns and Win
chesters, but Finally Surrender to Police.
CHICAGO, May 26.â Chicago was Invaded at 1 o'clock, this? morning by the
i-my of a hostile State numbering thirteen menâ the "District of Lake
llichigan." The invasion ended in a farce comedy, but came near to being
finished in dcaOly earnest. The casualties include oae boy shot in the leg
and one horse killed. Five invaders were arrested and the balance were
allowed to escape.
The trouble was precipitated by Captain George W. Streeter. a squatter, who
has from time to time created much trouble and litigation by his efforts to seize
lard along the shore of Lake Michigan. The land which he has for some time
claimed to be the "District of Lake Michigan" consists of made land on the
*r...re of Lincoln Park, a part of It Including one of the main park boulevards.
The courts have decided against the squatter again and again, but he has been
persistent in his efforts to grab the property. He claims that made land along the
Illinois shore does not belong to the State of Illinois, but is instead public do
main, tree to whoever settles upon it. Streeter organized the force which made
the descent upon Lincoln Park to-day, but was not with them In person. The
transport containing the- "troops" arrived off Lincoln Park sroon after midnight
at;<2 without difficulty they made a landing at the foot of Superior street and for
mally took possession of ISS acres of lar,.i claimed by Captain Streeter and his
subjects as the independent territory, the "District of Lake Michigan."
Rapid-fire puns, it is alleged, were on the transport decks, ready to cover, if
r.ocersarj-. the lancir.s of the troop?, but the shores were soon reached and with
out opposition the men made their way through the surf, rallied around their
leader, "Commandant" William 'Niles, ar.d hoisted an American flag in the center
of the invaded district.
Police Officer James O'Malley was on guard at the shore and hastened to
so::u a rÂ«Â»j><irt of the Invasion to the Ea^t Ch'.oag-o-avenue station, which in turn
transmitted tie infer inati-jn to Inspector Heldelmeyer. It was decided to take
no action npainst the invaders until af.cr consultation with the City Law De
partment.
As far as lejral advice was concerned the invaders had all the best of it.
The "commandant" Is the legal authority of the district government, holding-.
besides bla military title, that of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Under
Ws orders the transport, v.hidh is known only as "Biekl^burg's sailboat," hove
to :.nd droppeH anchor. Then it la alleged there were landed seventy-five Spring
field rifles with 1200 rounds of ammunition and two Gatling sruris.
Inuaedlately on landing a line of fortifications was marked out. A line of
plank was laid along the western edge of the claimed territory and a barbed wire
for.ee was stretched about a foot above it. Two forts, each about twelve feet
square and forming an embankment of dirt and piling about five feet high, were
y thrown up on either side of Superior street. Sentinels were detailed to
patrol a picket line just inside the barbed wire. The "commandant" gave orders
to his rnea that no one should be allowed to cross this line.
j^h riot calls Krere turned in and Chief of Police' Kipley was personally
notified, the Cits* Law Department was consulted before any action was taken
by the police.
Charles Erley, secretary of the Lincoln Park Board, was the first official to
attempt to force the line, but the determined and threatening attitude of the in
vaders compelled him to withdraw.
A short time afterward Paul Redelski. Lincoln Park superintendent, came
hurrying op la his buggy, but facing the same situation, he withdrew. At this
Juncture Captain Barney Eatr of the park police dashed up in his buggy and
attempted to force his way across the line. As bis horse would have crossed
thf "boundary^ "General" Niles ra.n forward and tired four shots from a gun.
It :s supposed that he did not mean to wound the captain, for he appeared to
aim only at the horse. The horse fell dead and one of .the shots, having sped
1 eyondj wounded Reuben Manley, 14 years of age, who was one of the crowd of
curious onlookers! The ball struck his rigrht knee. Inflicting a serious wound. An
othÂ«T bullet pju-sed through the lapel of Detective Hiatt's coat.
While the onlookers fcl! back and the excitement of the morning gave way
to 3, panic, another horse and buggy approached the line, but "Judge" Niles still
maintained !-Js ground. The occupants of the vehicle, a man named Murphy
and i-.is lU-ytar-nid daughter, did not sw^em to realize the gravity of 'the 'situa-"
tion rind the man pressed his horse forward. Niles clubbed his rifle, attacked
Murphy with the weapon and forced the horse back from the territory.
Meanwhile a conferer.ee had been held in the office of Acting Mayor Walker
and it had been determined that the squatters should be driven out at any cost.
Chief of Police Kipley was instructed at once to mobilize his forces and use such
measures as might Le necessary. The plan was to have the Lincoln Park police
order the Streeter force to disband, and if they did not to have President Wick
ershaxn of the Lincoln Park Board call upon the Chief. The Sheriff was to re
peat the demand and call upon the police to disperse them if there was further
resistance. In this way there would be no question as to the jurisdiction.
Chief of Police Kipley secured the co-operation of Fire Marshal Sweeney and
the tug Illinois was detailed to carry forty men with rifles down the river to ap
proach the district from the lake. Ail reserve forces under Inspector Hartnett at
Harrison street. Inspector Calas. Inspector Shea at Desplaines street and Inspec
tor Heidelmeyer and the East Chicago avenue station were ordered to rendezvous
at the latter station. Then orders were issued to bring up the police battery,
consisting nf one Gatling gun and two smoothbores.
All these preparations required time, and it was agreed that 3:30 would be
the hour at â¢which the forces would be In readiness. Chief of Police Kipley when
notified that" 500 men awaited his- orders at the East Chicago avenue station
selected as his aids Inspectors Hartnett, Heidelmeyer and Shea. Sheriff
Magorstat found that by enlisting bailiffs and almost his entire force he would
master about 100 assistants. Then the Chief heard from Captain Fowler of the
Police Battery, who had already begun active preparations in getting the guns
ready. '. " Â¦
By 3 p. m. streetcars and the corning and going of sixteen patrol wagons had
collected BOO policemen at the East Chicago avenue police station. At the same
time Chief of Police Kiuley had a telephone message that 200 officers were on
their way too from Hyde Park by way of the Illinois Central Railway to the
North Side.
It was found that the fireboat was so busy with a big fire on South Water
Ftreet that it could not be used, and a city tug was pressed into service. Police
Captain Revere was put in charge of the men on this boat.
The trouble was over, however, before the naval attack .could be made, and
to-night Buckleburg'p sailboat returned quietly to South Chicago.
The impending conflict ended in a fiasco about 15 minutes after 3 o'clock.
When "Judge" Niles and his four menâ all that was left of his armyâ heard
that they were to be ousted they sent word to Captain Baer requesting a parley.
I'pon his appearance the five men surrendered and were escorted to the East
Chicago avenue police station. On the way there the police attempted to dis
arm the members of the "army," and the efforts of the squatters to retain their
rifles created some commotion.
After his rifle had been taken from Xlles and while he was on his way to the
station he was struck several times by men in the crowd that pressed around
him. Once he endeavored to snatch his rifle from the officer who carried it, in
tending to shoot a man who had Just hit him. but was quickly subdued by the
police.
Etreeter caused to be circulated by the men who took' possession of the land
a grandiloquent proclamation, written after the style of the Declaration of In
dependence, in which he stated at great length that the land did not belong to
the State of Illinois nor anybody else and was the property of whomsoever set
to his men that no one should be allowed to cross this Mine.

Manufacture of Steel Cars.
Few people realize how rapid the growth
of the steel car Industry has been. Three
years ago there was practically nothing
done in that line, while to-day there are
10 000 men and boyBin the United States
earning their. living at it. and the Ameri
can steel car Is to be found not only all
over the American continent but in the
wilds of Africa and other regions in which
for obvious reasons It Is preferred to the
wooden vehicle. A load that would crush
the ordinary wooden car is carried with
ease by Its steel successor; 100,000 pounds
Is a common epecincation for their capa
city, and only recently 2500 cars, each ca
pable of carrying this Immense/weight,
were ordered by three of the leading
American railroads, the value of the order
amounting to $2,750,000.
The greater the carrying capacity of the
steel car the smaller the ratio of its
weight to the load carried. IThe steel car
carrying 100,000 pounds , weighs 35.000
pounds, the same as a wooden car that
carries only 70,000 pounds; the life of the
wooden car averages fifteen years, and It
costs $35 a year to keep it In repair; the
steel car, it' is estimated, will run for fifty
years, and Its repair bill amounts to but
$10 to $15 a year. No wonder the steel car
building company has work ahead for sev
eral years to come.
RINCON CLUB OPENING
NIGHT WAS A SUCCESS
Charles Adams, a Youthful Orator,
Creates a Sensation in De
bate With Men.
A debate before the Y. M. C. A. Uterary
Society last evening developed a young
orator, Charles Francis Adams, aged 19,
who advanced telling arguments In the
negative on the question of the retention
of the Philippine Islands by the United
States. There were three other debaters,
all adultsâ Edwin T. Hook, Alexander
Keller and Henry Warfleld. They spoke
with some force, but the surprise of the
evening was the talk of young Adams.
Sending the army and navy to the Phil
ippines, he said, did not authorize holding
them. One said that the Philippines had
been taken by right of conquest; but then
admitted that.tbera were rebels to sub
due, which seemed to indicate" that they
had not been conquered after all. Where
did the constitution of the United States
authorize the holding of colonies? Did
the people of the United States desire to
have the Filipinos as fellow citizens, to
vote and take part in American politics
and to come and go at will and compete
with those born on the soil of the United
States? There were eighty tribes in the
Philippines and many ol them were more
barbarous than ever were North Ameri
can Indians. <,^* â¢' -
One speaker had said, fo'young Adams
remarked emphatically, that- It would be
a good thing to have cheap sugar from
the Philippines to take the place of Ger
man sugar In the American market. Did
not that speaker know 'that Claus Spreck
els had established beet 'sugar factories
in California that had given much em
ployment and prosperity to the State, the
product alrealy helping to shut out for
eign sugar? Would it be a good thing to
have cheap sugar when the cheapness
came by reason of low wages and by the
establishment of competition that would
lower wages in California? Was It proper
to take from the Filipinos the rights that
they had that they might be given a sys
tem that' they would not appreciate?
What had become of the principle that
governments rightfully exist only by the
consent of the governed?

eral imperialists. In fact, Lord Rosebery
an.d those who pin their political faith to
the ex-Premier, regarded Manchester as
the crucial point of their struggle to turn
the party to their own way of thinking.
The Liberal candidate had pronounced
anti-war views, and had he been success
ful it would have sounded the death knell
of Lord Rosebery's chances of ever again
leading the party, and might have forced
him either to permanently retire or form a
separate organization. â¢
â¢ Lord Rosebery's followers are privately
Jubilating over the Unionists' sweeping
victory, to which they contributed by
tending to Manchester confidential envoys.
It is now believed the bulk of the Liberals
muBt see in Liberal imperialism the ortiy
plank whereby they can hope to return to
power. The vast majority of Englishmen,
regardless of party>are evidently strongly
in favor of the war. This sentiment. Lord
.Ro6ebery believes, can be manipulated so
as to give tho Liberals a fighting chance
at the next election. South Manchester
and the Isle of Wight have greatly
strengthened the hands of Lord Rose
bery's followers and have made the Lib
eral leader's return to active political life
almost a certainty.
Lord Rosebery's Plans.
. There is no truth in the report that Lord
Rosebery will form a coalition with Joseph
Chamberlain. What Lord Rosebery has
had in mind during the past. few months
has been an active campaign against the
Government for its dllatoriness In waging
the war and a sweeping- agitation for com
mon-sense reform of the army. This,
combined with expansion of the empire
and the social and economic planka which
have always distinguished the party,
would, he believes, give him a fair chance
of leading the now disintegrated and dis
credited party to victory.
While the bye-elections have elated the
Roseberyltes and depressed the so-called
"Little Englanders, they have also
caused the Conservatives to speculate
upon the desirability of an early dissolu
tion. In spite of previous rumors to the
contrary, it has been tacitly understood
among the Cabinet Ministers that the
general election must await the practical
end of the war. If not the pacification of
the Transvaal. Now, however, they find
they are able to get such large majorities
from the constituencies that it has be
come a serious question If it would not
be better to "make hay while the eun
shineB." So strong is this feeling that,
granting Lord Roberts makes fair prog
ress within the next month, it is quite
likely that a dissolution will occur at the
expiration of that period, though nothing
definite has yet been agreed upon.
In Parliament Itself the most Important
event of the week was the settlement of
the Australian federation difficulty, which
Mr. Ohamberlaln announced as a com
promise, but which the -delegates claim
a.s a complete concession of their de
mands. The bill enabling women to serve
as Aldermen and Councilors of London,
though it has passed its second reading,
will not come up again, aa it has little
chance of becoming a law.
Joy Over Mafeklng's Relief.
The Mafeking rejoicings have caused
the weekly papers to print serious arti
cles on the Increase of historical out
bursts in England, and they ask the ques
tion If the race is really losing its char
acteristics. A curious feature of the dem
onstrations was the enormous number of
buttons bearing Badpn-Powejl's and Rob
erts' photographs. The puBlic here has
taken up the button fad with an energy
equal to anything in its history in Amer
ica. The bulk of these buttons were im
ported from .America, the shrewd manu
facturers having procured photos of Brit
ish officers likely to become popular. .
Major General Baden-Powell, by the

I/ON'DOX, May 26.â The events of the
last few days have brought the internal
policy of Great Britain once more to the
fore. This 1b especially traceable in the
bye-elections which took place this week
in the Isle of Wight division of Hamp
shire and In South Manchester, at which
the Conservatives enormously increased
their majorities. The latter election is
described by Joseph Chamberlain, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies. In a con
gratulatory telegram to Hon. William
Peel, the successful candidate, as being: "a
splendid victory for the Imperial forces."
It is learned that it was an imperial vic

The Imperial Government still rejolcÂ«s
at the passage of ihe meat insiÂ»ection bill,
particularly because of its demonstrating
that the extreme Agrarians have no"

severe as a test of their relative fctrengUi
and as a prel!mina.ry to the struggle to
decide the nature of the projected com

extreme Agrarians. The fact is now
pointed out \v the Remi-olficial press. Eh-.

even a large part of the Bavarian news
papers and even fcwralcf the Munich
papers nearest to the Bavarian court.
The correcpondf-nt of the Associated

that the breach was started by gossipers

BERLIN, May 26.â Interest this week
has centered on the doings of the Reich
stag and Diet and Prince L>udwig's
speech. It has long been murmured in
court circles at Berlin and Munich that
the relations between the two courts
were seriously disturbed. A number of
evicts bore this out. The Prince Re

Tfce Chamber of Deputies by its vote at
Tuesday's session told the Government
to take such measures as would cast the
Dreyfus nightmare once and for all into
oblivion. Only eeventy-nlne irreconcllables
opposed the resolution which directed the
Caoinet to take this course, M. Waldeck-
Rouspeau. the Premier, had previously ap
peared to be lukewarm about the fate of
his amnesty bill, the provisions of which
prevent further criminal proceedings
arising out of recriminations In the Drey
fus affair, but the Chamber's meaning on
Tuesday was unmistakable and had the
effect of immediately quickening his
apathy Into an urgent request for the
Senate committee to hasten its action on
the bill and remove it from the pigeon
hole, where It promised to lie dormant.
The bill has already passed the Chamber
and now only awaits adoption by the Ben
ate.
The measure In Its original form applied
for amnesty to others besides the Drey
fus portion. As the moment afforded an.
exceptional opportunity to carry out the
work of definitive appeasement the com
mlt*ee decided to take up the Dreyfus
portion and report thereon aa early as
possible, though this will hardlV be done
by next Monday, as the Government de
sires. The decision of the committee Is
important as a step toward carrying out
what Is clearly the wiph of the majority
in Parliament. The bill will prevent the

Cannot Earn Â» Living.
Some boys attempted to gain a pittance
by selling exhibition tickets at a profit
of 2 cents each, but their efforts were
stifled by the interference qf their French
competitors, who are able to draw all in
tending purchasers except Americans and
Kng-lisnmen by proclaiming the Americana
as foreigners. ' Â¦ â¢
These unfortunate experiences should
warn venturesome American youths
against petting forth in hopes of finding
employment here. Neither the embassy
nor the consulate has funds to be used in
giving assistance in such cases, and the
youths will be obliged to get home as best
they can.
W hlle this antipathy holds against those
who axe trying to compete in the French
labor market pleasure-seeking American
visitors have no reason to complain of
their welcome. The feeling which is now
so bitter against Englishmen, with whom
Americans are so often confounded, owing
to their language, does not exist toward
the latter when their nationality is estab
lished. This fact is now becoming recog
nized among - the Americans, many of
whom have adopted the habit of wearing
a miniature enameled stars and stripes as
a distinctive emblem. The French news
papers have remarked this and have
called the attention of their readers to its
significance. One of them publishes an
interview with an American whom a re
porter met on the boulevard wearing the
ins'.pnia and of whom the newspaper man
asked the reason. The American stated
his nationality and said:
"We ardently desire to affirm that we
are Americans, not Englishmen, and we
meet with gTeater sympathy from Paris-
Jans on their noticing our little flag. We
are proud of our country and are glad to
be known as Americans." ,
Exit the Dreyfus Affair.
PARIS, May 26.â Now that all the na
tional pavilions in the Rue des Nations
have been opened to the public, a compar
ison of the artistic effect of our building
with that of its neighbors is undoubtedly
unfavorable to the former. While the
general external appearance is a matter
of architectural taste, the nudity of its
interior elicits the harshest criticism.
Seldom is a word of praise of it heard
from visiting' American* and the building:
has been already christened with various
uncomplimentary nicknames. Many offi
cials recogrnize the disparity and the pres
ent condition of the pavilion will be much
improved. The bareness of the first floor
will be relieved by the erection of a cen
terpiece ol palms and flowers, which will
be circled by an upholstered settee, the
iioor itself probably will be renewed,
brighter-tinted carpets placed on the
stairs, and the balustrades covered with
velvet, and other decorative modiricatlons
will be taken with a view to lightening the
general effect. It is but fair to explain
that the present structure was not the
original laea of Architect Coolldge, who
submitted plans of an entirely different
character for the pavilion, which were re
jected.
A number of unfortunate cases of suffer
ing- aro coming under the notice of the
American officials in Paris. Many bright,
energetic young Americans, having juat
means enough to transport them here and
being anxious to see the exposition, came
with the idea of finding some Braall occu
pation which would provide them with the
means of existence during their stay, some
also hoping to strike openings which they
might develop remuneratively. -There is
no false pride about them; and they are
willing to accept even menial employment,
such as selling newspapers, blacking boots
and hawking exposition tickets. They
have, however, met unexpected obstacles,
against which all their pluck and vim are
unavailing. Instead of the freedom of la
bor, which obtains in America and which
insures success to the willing, intelligent
worker, they find every outlet hedged
about with red-tape regulations or preju
dice against the employment of foreigners.
Newspaper stands are accorded only to
pensioners and a license for bootblacking
is practically unobtainable, owing to the
interminable period occupied by the pre
liminaries to the application.

NEW YORK. May 2G.â Once more Penn
sylvania University athletes proved their
skill and stamina against their collegiate
opponents In track and field events by
winning the championships of the inter
collegiate athletic association, on Colum
bia Held this afternoon.
The Pennsylvania cannot do too much
honor to their wonderful athlete, A. C.
Kraenzlein. In the history of the associa
tion's games no athlete has done what
Kraenzlein did to-day. Yesterday he qual
ified in four eventsâ the 100-yard dash, the
high and low hurdles and tho running
broad Jump. This afternoon he won three
of these events, namely, the 100-yard dash
and tho high and low hurdles. 1 laving
had to use all his reserve strength In these
events, Kraenzlein did not take part In
the final contest for the running broad
Jump, which was delayed purposely for
his convenience, and Meyer Prinstein of
byracuse won out with a jump of 23 feet
8 Inches. Kraenzleln's Jump In the pre
liminaries proved good enough to give him
tne second place.
The weather was most unpleasant. Al
most from the beginning of the games
there was a continuous downpour of rain,
but tho athletes and tho thousands of
spectators stayed all through the drench
ing downpour and the games wound up in
wnat might be well termed a Scotch mist.
Alec Grant of Pennsylvania made the
two-mile run In better time than It has
been done before. He had tho distinction
of breaking his own record of last year of
10 minutes 3 2-5 seconds by winning in 9
minutes 51 3-5 seconds. Princeton's rep
resentatives wero shocked when they saw
Cregan quit at a mile and a half. The race
was simply a gift for virant, who won by
ten yards in the easiest fashion. The
summary follows:

yards Harvard's men saw that they were
beaten. Much interest centered In the
100 yards, in which Jarvls and Kraenz
leli: came together. It was somewhat of
a surprise to the experts to see JarVis
beaten. Much interest was centered In
the broad Jump also when Kraenzlein and
Prlnsteln began to try for honors.
Kraenzlein of Pennsylvania was the
hero of the day. He is 6 feet 1 Inch tall
and weighs 170 pounds. His legs are ex
tremely lonft and his body Is very short.
He stood his work remarkably well, but
after the finish of the low hurdles, which
wjis his last event, ho was "all out."

brought out and made to sit on two bars
of iron previously laid down on the
ground. This act implies that the two are
bound together with the iron band of
matrimony. The priest gives to each a
cipar and some betel nuts, which thâ¢

fowls over their heads, and, in the course

feeling rather timid, and v/ithout a cheer
to urge them on to victory; but each man
went to his work as If California "root

that was when it was announced thai
Flaw had broken the collegiate record in

California's third contest with the

she had a field of twenty-eight colleges
against her. It shows California ranks

A Negro Bayman's Diamonds.
"I spent my vacation this year flshlnjc
on the East Florida coast," said a New
Orleans lawyer, "and among other places
I visited was a primitive little settlement
north of Cedar Keys. One of the charac
ters of the place Is a big mulatto known
as 'Diamond Bill.' and I engaged him sev
eral times to take me out in his lugger I
taw at once that he had derived his sobri
quet from the gaudy Jewelry he â¢ wore
but when we were out together on the
boat I was surprised to note that the
gewgaws were all genuine and worth a
good deal of money.
"When I questioned him on the subject
he sat down by me on the thwarts and
told me an Interesting story. It seemed
that some years ago he had saved the life
of a child that fell overboard from |
pleasure yacht, and the mother gave him
a small diamond ring. Later %n a St
Louis jeweler came to the settlement to
fish and told Bill that the ring waT worth
$,a. The luggerman was astonished and
was proportionately impressed Vith the
advantage of diamonds as representing
arge sums in small compass, it instant
y occurred to him that It would be a good
Idea to Invest his surplus cash in that
way and always have It on his person,
secure from fire or thieves. The jeweler
agreed to act as buyer for him. and sinca
then he had gradually acquired his pres
ent collection, which consists of three
studs, four rings, a large solitaire collar
button and a cluster pin, worth altogether
at least $2500.
"Bill Is a thrifty darkey, and between
fishing and tourists does well, but dia
mond buying has become a mania with
him. and he saves every cent he makes for
that purpose. I asked him If he wasn't
afraid of being drowned with all his treas
ures on him, which would be unjust to his
pretty mulatto wife. I'ae thought 'bout
that,' he said gloomily, 'but Liza's too
good lookln' ter stay er widder very long,
an' I don't want no other nigger man
struttin' round with my sparks.' "âNew

PAN JOSE. May K.-The California
Cored Fruit As=Â«.-Â»eiation. which was or
panixfA to handle the prune crop, is issu
ing letters to its members stating the
modifications in its plans to place the or
ganization on a secure footing, now that
it failed to secure control of SO per cent of
the Stato'p acreage. The pian proposed
now is practically the same as that agreed
upon between the Fresno raisin growers
stid packers about ten days ago. President
Bond and the directors are confident that
under these changes they will be able to
handle the prune crop at an advantage to
the growers.
liut 80 jx?r cent cf the acreage of the
State, althouph &0 por cent of the prune
area of the Fanta Clara Valley, had been
sipned. Thf modifications are meeting
â¢with the approval of the local growers,
and so far several hundred have agreed
to leave their Iruit with the association.
Inside of ttr. days the association expects
to know just how it stands in the matter.
About the or.ly differences from the
original Fcheme is that the association
â¢will not attempt to maintain stable prices,
l;ut will fix the price from time to time
es mark' t conditions warrant, and it is
believed this will force many who are now
outside. the association to come in. as they
will not l>Â»* able to obtain any more
than association prices. Packers in re
turn will refuse to buy from any but as
sociation members.
President Bond's letter to the growers Is
as follows:
To j>revent a failurt of the association the
packer* have agreed to modify their contract
In the fallowing particulars, viz.: ; â¢
By striking out the provision guaranteeing

the rr.anatement of the association.

CONCESSIONS
OF PACKERS ARE
SATISFACTORY
A party of five American and London
capitalists arrived at the Palace Hotel
last night, all ready to embark on the
Samoa, which will sail within the next ten
days to the northeastern Siberian coast
on an exploration expedition that will last
seven months. It is an enterprise of big
proportions and may develop into a colos
sal mining and commercial scheme if an
ticipated conditions are realized.
For the past week Russians and Eng
lishmen have been arriving daily In this
city to Join the party, which will set out
for Siberia next month. A syndicate
composed of Russians and Englishmen
are at the head of the enterprise. Vladi
mir Wonlarlarsky holds the concessions
from the Emperor of all the Russian for
land on the northeastern Siberian coast
covering an area twice that of France and
possessing a coast line of more than 1500
miles. The present expedition will be one
of exploration merely, no thought to Im
mediate colonization or commercial activ
ity being entertained. The trip will take
the best part of eight or nine months, at
the end of which time the Samoa will re
turn to this port and further plans of oper
ation will be decided upon according to the
report made by the exploring party.
The syndicate controlling the expedition
is known as the Eastern Siberian syndi
cate of London and It ls through this cor
poration that the capital has been forth
coming for the present venture. The con
cessions are all Russian and emanate di
rectly from the Imperial authority.
One of Russia's foremost engineers, C.
Bogdavonltch, represents the Russian in
terests ln the syndicate, and he will ac
company the expedition on Its trip to
Siberia. In charge of the exploration
party will be G. D. Roberts, an old Cali
fornian and a miner in the early days of
the b!g placers. Other prominent mem
bers interested in the trip of the Samoa
are: J. B. Landfleld Jr., Is. J. Stewart, F.
\V. Baker, Forbes Rickard and Cecil
Johnstone.
The Samoa will proceed from this port
to British Columbia and then go to Cape
Nome, where it will be met by a Russian
gunboat, which will transfer a number
of Cossacks to the Samoa to join the ex
ploration party. To the Cossacks will fall
the burden cf the rough work of the trip.
Several meetings will be held ln this city
before the departure and all the prelim
inary plans will be fully perfected.

NOT IN THE PLAY.
Stage and Scared the Actors and
Audience.
Escaped Thunder Rolled Down the
It was at an Edinburgh theater and the
piece was "Lear." The King himself was
battling furiously with the storm and the
audience was hushed in sympathy with
the struggles of the poor old man. Sud
denly a terrific crash of thunder, that
startled even I,ear himself, though he had
encountered that same sorm ln the same
place for a fortnight, was heard, and
there immediately burst through the scene
a score of nine-pound cannon balls. These
rolled down the sloping stage with ac
celerated velocity on the footlight. mak
ing the patriarchal king seek refuge ln
theiwlngs with more alacrity than dignity,
and presenting an aspect so threatening
to the musicians that they Incontinently
fled. Something approaching a panic was
on the point of seizing the audience, for
the scene had been knocked down and
other Bounds of alarm mingled with the
rumble of the balls, when the last shot,
having come to a stop, the real state
of matters dawned upon the cooler
portion of the spectators. They had been
treated unexpectedly and unintentionally
to a peep behind the scenes. It so hap
pened that the manager of this theater
had a method of his own for making
thunder and his thunder was regarded
by all who heard It and considered them
selves judges of thunder as magnificent
Its component parts were the stage car
penter, a wheelbarrow and the cannon
balls that had so Inausplciously revealed
themselves. The carpenter would wheel
his barrow load of balls to and fro over
wooden ledges and uneven surfaces at the
back of the stage, these being so con
structed as to send Into the auditorium a
fine, full and sonorous roar. On the
night in question, however, the carpenter
missed his footing, the barrow upset and
the catastrophe we have been describing
happened. â Cassell's Magazine.
THE GORILLA'S COUETSHIP.
rican Forest.
Battle Between Giant Apes in an Af-
"After the adjustment of our little un
pleasantness with tho South," said Cap
tain Jack Benton. "I drifted back into
civil life. It seemed monotonous, how
ever, after the excitement of campaign
ing, and receiving an offer to go to Africa
and collect animals for menageries, I
Jumped at it. My work took me into the
interior of upper Guinea, which was then
nbout as wild a country as there was in
the world.
"One morning I left camp to make a
circuit of some traps we had set in the
night, and, as I wasn't on the lookout for
big game.. I took only a light riile with
me. Trudging through the woods, I came
on a little clearing, and there, not -fifty
feet away, I saw a big male gorilla. He
was on aM fours, half-squatting on the
ground.
"Equipped with only a light rifle. I had
no ambition to meddle with the beast. I
slipped back into th<> underbrush, and
was about to make off as quietly as pos
sible when the peculiarity of the gorilla's
actions attracted me. He seemed to be
trying to look as amiable as was possible
for euch a monster, and a second glance
showed me the reason for this. At the
right of the clearing was a second gorilla,
smaller, but equally ferocious-looking, a
fitting mate for tho first big brute. 1 had
evidently discovered a gorilla courtship.
"The male gorilla, trying to attract the
attention of the female by uncouth mo
tions, was beginning to advance clumsily
toward her, when suddenly a dull boom!
boom! sounded from far away in the for
est. Up to that instant the male gorilla,
while savage-looking, had given no sign
of being angry, but now all was changed.
His hugo Jaws shut together with a snap.
Then through the silence which had fallen
on the Jungle when the first sullen chal
lenge was heard came a sharp bark, fol
lowed by a deep humming sound. It was
the terrible battle call of a full-grown
gorilla, the cry sent out when he is about
to light to the death for a mate. At the
end of each echoing challenge the hairy
giant beat with his big hands on his chest,
while at the other end of the clearing,
waiting to bestow her hand on the vic
tor, sat the female gorilla whose charms
had Inspired such jealous rage.
"Suddenly there was a little flurry at
the left end of tne clearing, and the chal
lenger broke through the bushes Into
plain sight. I could see he was a veteran,
with the scars of many battles on him.
His big lips were rolled up ln a grim smile,
showing broken teeth and great gaps, the
result of former battles. . Both gorillas
were taller than the average man as they
stood on their hind feet for battle, but
their enormous breadth of chest and
shoulders made them look llko squatting,
hairy giants. In fighting ability both
seemed enual, for while the second' older
gorilla had evidently been in more bat
tles, yet the one J had first seen in the
Jungle had an advantage In strength and

"Neither of the blgr animals wasted time
In preliminaries; they had worked them
selves up Into such an Insanity of rage
that only killing would satisfy. Each ad
vanced on his hind legs until within six
feet of the other. Then the younger go
rilla began to fight. Stepping forward with
marvelous quickness for such an ungain
ly animal, he struck a flail-Uke blow with
his huge paws. Had the blow gone home,
no mere flesh and blood, not even the big
boned frame of his antagonist, could have
withstood It. But the old gorilla had been
ln too many death grapples to be caught
so early in the fight. Even as the big
arm swung around he sprang forward,
coming in close so as to miss the full
force of the swing. The next instant he
had swung his own arm around â¢ the
younger gorilla's neck, encircling it with
four feet of steel muscles and holding his
enemy's head stiff upright, bo that he
could not bring the terrible teeth into
play. Then the old gorilla opened his
heavy jaws, and getting a firm grip on
the right shoulder of the younger gorilla,
held on like a bulldog, tearing his way
through the knotted muscle and sinews
and snoulder blade of his opponent. At
the same time the left arm of the old
fighter wrapped itself about the younger
gorilla In a rib-breaking grip.

"WASHINGTON. May 25.â In accordance
with the recommendation of the Court of
Inquiry, the Secretary of the Navy has
appointed a court-martial to try Captain
John McGowan on charges connected
with the killing of a Filipino. The detail
for the court is ae follows: Rear Ad
miral Silas Casey, president; Rear Ad
miral Francis J. II. Higginson, Rear Ad
miral Adelbert S. Barker. Captain J. J.
Read. Captain Frank Wildes. Captain F.
A. Cook, Captain B. P. Lamberton, Cap
tain Theodore F. Jewell and Captain
Charles H. Davis. This court is made up
of an unusual number of officers high in
rank because of the rank of the accused.
The Secretary's order directs the court
to meet at the "Washington navy yard at
10 o'clock on Tuesday morning next.
There are three charges, with a corre
sponding number of specifications, upon
which the court will act. The first is
"scandalous conduct tending to the de
struction of good morals."
The specification under this charge la
that "on or about the 21st day of Novem
ber, 1S93. between the hours of 12 noon
and 1 o'clock, the said John McGowan.
captain In the United States navy, being
in command of the United States steamer
Monadnock, then lying in the harbor of
Cebu. P. I., did wilfully and without justN
fiable cause and without the exercise of
proper discretion fire a shot from a re
volver In the direction of a native shore
boat which had approached within hail
ing distance of said vessel, thereby
wounding a Filipino, one of the occu
pants of said .boat, who subsequently
died from the effects of saJd wound; this
to the scandal and disgrace of the naval
service."
The second charge is "Conduct to the
prejudice of good order and discipline."
ajid the specification is that Captain Mc-
Gowan made careless use of firearms in
shooting at the native boat.
The third charge is "neglect of duty in
that, knowing that it was his duty, as
commanding officer of the Monadnock, to
report to the commander in chief of the
United States naval force to which the
Monadnock was attached the circum
stances attending the said shooting, he
did nevertheless at the time of said oc
currence and thereafter while in com
mand of said vessel wholly neglect and
fall to make such report to his comman
der in chief, and the said McGowan did
therein and thereby neglect his duty as
commander of a vessel of the United
States navy."

that things looked so desperate for the
younger lighter. The first gorilla s splen
did lighting ability and tremendous
strength snowed themselves. \v mrnnj,
up his left arm he fastened his long nn
gera about his antagonist's throat ami
iried to break his grip and stiove his head
back. At lust the only effect of this was
to make the old fellow tighten his grip
on the other s shoulder. Then the younger
gorilla put forth all his strength. I could
see the muscles of his arm, shoulders and
back gather themselves into big knots
and bunch up as if they would break
through the skin. The murderous deep
set eyes started forward, until they were
level with the cheek-bones. A last des
perate effort and the big head went back,
the tightly closed jaws of the old guerilla
tearing out flesh and sinews as they were
shoveu away, but not ungrlppcd. Then
the old lighter's right arm slowly and re
luctantly uncoiled from the other's neck.
The younger gorilla had broken the death
grip. Botn big fighters were momentarily
tree and stepped back to regain breath.
"Although wounded, it was the younger
gorilla that made the attacK. This time
he did not waste any efforts on blows
with his huge paws. When they had ap
proached almost within striking distance
the younger of the fighters made a rush.
He received a blow on the head that
would have crushed a man's skull. It
scarcely staggered him. Then both his
long arms wrapped themselves about his
opponent's necst, and holding his antag
onist tightly clasped, he began biting with
tierce energy, not a steady gripping bite,
but furious, tearing gnashings, which
npped skin and rtesh from face and shoul
ders and chest.
"The older gorilla was taken by sur
prise at this sudden rush and change of
tactics by his opponent. But though at
a disadvantage, he wns too old a fightsr
to Le easily dismayed. First he secured
a grip on his opponent's throat, and
straining every muscle tried to tear him
self'free from the infuriated grasp of the
younger beast. He might as easily have
broken a steel cable as the strangling hold
of his enraged opponent. Then the older
fighter relaxed his grip on the other's
throat, and placing both his big human
like paws on the younger's face, tried to
force hlÂ» head back.
This brought out a terrific trial of
strength. If the old gorilla could force
the other's head back, he would be free
and might perhaps break his enemy's
neck. Each of the huge fighters seemed
to know this and put forth all of his
giant strength. l>ack, phoulders, arms
and neck were called into play, the heavy
muscles rippling up and gathering into big
knots. The snarling growls, which had
marked the beginning of the fight had
died away. Each animal was silent. A
stlllnes? seemed to have fallen on the
whole jungle, and the crackling of the
twigs and dry leaves seemed unnaturally
loud as the two gigantic fighters came to
the supreme struggle.
"For what was probably half a minute,
but seemed an hour, the two semi-human
shapes stood there putting forth every
energy. At last the younger fighter's face
.was within two inches of his opponent's
head. The young gorilla made a supreme
effort, twisted his head suddenly and be
fore his opponent could dodge had fast
ened his teeth ln a death grip on the
throat of the veteran fighter.
"The veteran was borne backward, car
rying his foe down with him. Unless he
could loosen the grip on his throat he was
doomed, and the old fighter knew it. Over
and over on. the ground the two huge apes
rolled, fighting desperately, but without
sound save for the shrill hissing of their
breaths as it was forced from their heav
ing chests. The veteran of many a hard
fought jungle battle knew his own end
had come.
"T'n to this time the battle had bÂ«Â»*>n
fought In silence, but as the old gorilla
gave up the contest and felt the teeth of
his antagonist sinkingr deeper and deeper
into his throat, the pain was greater than
h<Â» could bear. He broke Into a walling
pry that echoed through the jungle. I
have heard the death cry of many ani
mals, but never a call like that of the
dying gorilla. For it was not like an nni
rrial, but the wall of a man in overmaster
ing painâ a choking half sob, half shriek.
Again and again It rose uo. T lifted my
rifle and then lowered It. for I could not
help the old gorilla, and to meddle in that
fteht with onlv mv light rifle meant my
own death. The half human wall broke
out again, but while T was standing ir
resolute It. ceased. The fierce, hard-fight
ing, hard-hltlng. younger gorilla had been
working hi? way through his antagonist's
throat and had at last bitten through the
windpipe. Tho great fight was over, and
the veteran of many similrir contests had
met the fate he had meted out to others.
"I watched the younger ape, as If fas
cinated, whllo he Â¦wroaked his revenge on
the body of his dead enemy. Then with
a start it occurred to me that I would
suffer a similar fate if I stayed in th!Â».t
vicinity. T5ut T had no r*Â»al cause fnr
anxfety. The gorilla had oth*r matters to
think of. The last irllmpse T had of the
conqueror was as. with the stlnr<Â» of baftl<Â»
still in ln his eyes and covered from head
to foot with his own blood and that of
his enemy, he marched off In triumph to
ward her for whom h<Â» had fought Â«o des
perately and so well."â New York Sun.

BOISE, Idaho, May C6.â By an explosion
In the Florida Mountain tunnel of the
Trade Dollar mine, at Silver City, at 10
o'clock this morning Dan Joyce was In
"antly killed and Asher Jessie died at
b:15 to-night from injuries received. Joyce
came from Alania, Colo. He was 35 years
of age and had no family. Jessie was
from Nampa, where his parents reside.
He was 22 years of age. Andy lJavls was
terribly Injured, the loft side of his face
being blown away and his left eye de
stroyed. It is thought he will recover.
Joe Nelson's shoulder was broken by Hy
ing rocks. Two other men were stunned,
but they will be out to-morrow.
The shift that went off at 7 a. m. left
one hole that missed. The shift going on
at that time was notified and found the
missing hole. The met set up their drills
and went to work, and it is supposed one
of the drills struck the cap of the unex
ploded charge. The resulting explosion
was terrific. Joyce's head was blown from
his shoulders and Jessie's skull was
crushed. Three muckers had just left
with a train of rock, otherwise the loss of
life might have been greater. When Da
vis was found the body of Joyce was
found lying across his legs. Asked if he
was hurt, he said: "No, not bad; look
after the other fellows."
A Coroner's inquest was held, the ver
dict being in accordance with the facts.

Special Dlsratch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. May 26.â After a comatose
sleep of a week Bernardo HIguera, a
young Spaniard. 20 years old, residing; in
tho foothills east of this city, regained
consciousness to-day. His case is a pe
culiar cnÂ« and greatly alarmed the Span
ish and Portuguese residents of that sec
tion. For a time It was believed HIguera
was dead, and his family on several oc
casions was on the verge of calling In an
undertaker.
Last Saturday HIguera started for a
plenlc in a canyon near Alum Rock Park,
lie was seated In the back of a spring
wagon, with his feet dangling over the
rear. The driver whipped up the horse,
throwing Higuera out. He struck on tho
back of hla head and was picked up un
conscious. No signs of life were discern
ible and he was taken home.
He was supposed to be dead, but other
signs of death failing to materialize the
calling of an undertaker was delayed.
Nourishment was forced down his throat.
To-day he regained consciousness and
was brought to this city for treatment.
It Is supposed that In falling he struck
the base of the brain, which caused par
tial paralysis.

WASHINGTON*. May 26.-Right Rev.
Bishop Blenk of the Catholic diocese of
Porto Rico has just sent to America four
teen young men to be fitted for the priest
hood and ordained for his diocese. These
Btudents have entered St. Mary's Sem
inary, Baltimore, and on the completion
of their theological studies they will be
consecrated priests In the Archcathedral
in Baltimore, after which they will return
to Porto Rico and take charge of various
parishes. These are the first Porto Rican3
to study for the priesthood in the United
States and this is the initial step towara
carrying American-educated priests to our
new possessions.
Trappist Monks have obtained permis
sion from Rome through the apostolic
delegation in Washington to found a new
abbey In the United States. They will be
located at Cumberland, R. I., where they
have purchased a farm and will at once
begin erecting a monastery. They camt
to America from Tracadlo. Nova Scotia,
where they have one of the oldest reli
gious establishments In the Western Con
tinent. The Trappist Monks are the strict
est religious class in the Catholic church.
They lead lives of pennance and prayer
and daily scourge themselves. They main
tain continued silence, and never eat meat
of any kind nor any delicacies or stimu
lants. They sleep on hard boards, with
neither pillows nor mattresses. Their
order Is divided into priests and brothers.
The former wear robes of white serge
and the latter are garbed in coarse brown
cloth, and on their feet they wear shoes
of wood. The chief work of their lives is
to educate and elevate the poor, although
the main object of the order Is pennance
and prayer. ;,-;,-

It is not generally known that the sugar
pine forest, the scene of to-day's outing,
is only thirty-rive miles north of the Yo
eemlte Valley. The magnitude of the tim
ber holdings of the West Side Flume and
Lumber Company excites wonder. It is
estimated that the MjOOO acres of dense
pine forest contains i,20(MÂ»00,(KÂ» feet of
lumber. The basin where the company is
now cutting embraces 7j.00u.000 feet. The
grrt-at reserve of big trees is a thousand
Feet higher than the gToves scon to-day.
The company is not cutting more than
1>j0.O0O feet a month.
The railroad extension has proved prof
itable, however, in other lines than lum
ber, and it is certain that the railway will
t* pushed higher up on the flank of the
Surras. â¢
The special Pullman train of two sleep
ers, dir.er and compartment cars came
through from San Francisco without
other incident than a hot box on the diner.
Crowds were at the depot at Oakdale. So
nera and Jam-stown.
The Journey by rail from Carters to the
forest la a wonderful ride. The scenery
of mountain torrents, deep canyons, lofty
trees and startling' railroad curves and
grade* leave* a lasting Impression on the
irJnd of. the tourist. The great throng
moved from Carters to the forest rode In
open platform cars with rail guards and
se&ts running- lengthwise on the side and
center. The young ladies stayed on the
center planks while the train rounded the
wonderful curves. The train was photo
graphed In positions which would seem
perilous to other than practical railroad
men. Great credit is given to J. W. Bar
rett, superintendent of the mill at Carters,
and J. N. Nash, superintendent of the
logging ctmp, and to Mrs. Nash for hand
ling the throng and bringing all back
safely without a single mithap to mar the
pleasure of the cay. Engineer Jonos was
praJs-ed by the tourists for his skill in
handling the engine. The road is to be
come famous as a. scenic route.

AN flNTI-SHEEP LfiW.
' I 'HE complete destruction of the fine grazing
I lands of Arizona and Southern Utah has caused'
* the driving of countless thousands of sheep into
Idaho and Wyoming, to help eat out the ranges
there which were already carrying more sheep than
they ought. Still, as long as the ranges are common
the starved flocks of Arizona and Utah have as much
right to them as any others. Wyoming has met the
invasion on the border with sanitary quarantine in
front and Winchesters in the background. It is un
derstood that if the quarantine officers don't find
scab on the sheep they will soon find holes in the
shepherds. In Idaho an old law has been found pro
hibiting the grazing of sheep within two miles of a
residence unless they belong to the owner thereof.
Under this law an invading shepherd has been ar
rested, and the courts will be called on to decide
whether it is a constitutional means of abridging the
free range of the commons on the public- domain.
Of course it will be found unconstitutional. If the
range is free, nothing can abridge its use by all
stockmen, and the settler must submit to have the
grass gnawed clear to his fences, and his own stock
starved. ' He may theo think that he is thinking
enough to see that his salvation depends not upon
unconstitutional laws of his own State, nor upon the
mouthing of politicians, but upon a Federal law to
end the free range by leasing it, and protecting his
right to a leasehold of the range that abuts on his
land.
The famine-smitten sheep of Utah are doing mis
sionary work. We desire to speed thorn on their de
structive way. They find a meadow in front of them
and leave a desert behind them, but nothing else will
teach some men that free range means no range and
a speedy end of the grazing business.

CONGRESSIONAL COURTESY.
THE interesting information comes from Wash
ington that the House has passed a bill appro
priating something over $200,000 to pay Con
federate oncers and soldiers for horses taken from
them when Lee surrendered at Appomattox. The bill
is said to have been passed as a courtesy to its author,
Mr. Cox of Tennessee, who is about to retire after
ten years' service. The country is grateiul to Mr.
Cox that he did not introduce a bill to pay the Con
federate debt, for with the courtesy of the House on
tap :t might have passed. His moderation equaled
that of Robert, Lord Clive, and we are glad that he
stopped at Confederate "critters" and did not take in
cotton bonds and the "bluebacks."
The reason given for the bill is that these horses
were taken in violation of Lee's terms of surrender to
Grar.t. It is strange that Grant, who was on the
ground, was not informed that his terms were not
being observed by those under his command. It 15
strange, also, that this incident does not figure in the
many Confederate complaints that have been pub
lished since the war. In these no opportunity to gird
the Yankees has been omitted, and as under the terms
given Lee by Grant the taking of horses was plain
horse-stealing it is not reasonable to suppose that
such an excellent chance to pillory "the Yankee
thieves" would have gone unimproved.
It is among the curiosities of war and peace that the
first the people know of this horse-stealing is the
thrusting of the hand of Congress into their pockets
to pay for it nearly forty years after it happened! It
is probable that some horses were abandoned by Lee's
men, or that in the confusion of transition from battle
to surrender, from war to peace, some were lost,
but it is incredible that Grant's Â¦officers, aware of the
turns of surrender, for they were proclaimed to both
armies, immediately quit fighting and went to steal
ing horses. In its delightful spasm of courtesy the
House does not seem to have suffered itself to con
sider that while it put a garland on the hat of Judge
Cox it put a stain on every officer and soldier of
Grant's army.
To the people of California the incident has a pecu
liar interest. This, like all the Union States, had to
come to the rescue of the Federal Government in
1861-62. The Federal treasury was empty and the
Federal credit low in those days. State credit was
better, and Congress celled on the States to equip
troops 2nd spend mor.ey and use their credit in behalf
of the Ur.ion. This they did. Their response to the
call was instant and generous. That response saved
the Union, for it enlarged at once the military ener
gies of the people, which otherwise would have
waited for inspiration from the exhausted fountain of
Federal authority. Under that call California spent
over three millions of dollars for the Federal Govern
inent and thereby saved to the United States .over
thirty millions of dollars, since it would have cost that
much to have srpplied from the eastern side of the
continent the defensive measures which we equipped
from here. Not only the pledge but the law of the
land required the repayment of this money to Cali
fornia. It has been repnid to every other State in the
Union but this. A commission of the War Dcpart
....
ment. committees of both houses, officers of the
treasury, have concurred in reporting that it is due
the State and should be paid, but it is not paid. Per
haps it would be a good thing to have the bill for its
paj'mer.t introduced by some ex-Confederate who is
about to retire from Congress, when it would prob
ably be passed as a courtesy!
There is nothing vague about this claim. It was
not delayed until nearly forty years after the war
ended. In the way pointed out and required by the
act of Congress which invited the expenditure the
agents of the State h3\e documented and proved
every penny of the expenditure. This was done as
long ago as the administration of Governor Booth.
Yet not a dollar of it has been paid, and the State still
waits for Congress to do justice and treat California
as the other States were treated.
This is the reason that Californians feel a peculiar
interest in the bill to pa}* Lee's "critter soldiers" for
horses alleged to have been etolcn by Grant's men
nearly forty years ago.

Can you imagine such a play, "commfs
slonod for production" at the Knicker
bocker Theater. New York, and dedicated,
let us say. to Messrs. Klaw and Erianger?
The vast difference between the results
attained by Messrs. Klaw and Erlanger
and those "attained by George Alexander
la not surprisng when we remember that
the former are in the theatrical business
purely for the dollars that are to be made,
while the latter la In it because he la.
primarily, an artist. "By their fruits yÂ©
shall know them." For my part i prefer
the glory of "Paolo and Francesca" to the
giory of 20 per cent.
In the April Cosmopolitan Miss May Ir
win has failed to conceal behind a veil
of Irwlnesque English seme sensible ideas
about the business of the stage aa a ca
reer. Her chief thought, exemplified in
her practice, is that "after the player is
(has become) an accepted entertainer and
Instructor of the public," he Is bound to
become his own ma nagorâ bound to. that
Is. If he is to attain any permanent em
inence in his profession. The history of the
stage, both In France and in England,
bears out this contention. Who ar* the
great men among the English actors?
Garrlck. Kean. Macready. Irving. Every
one of these has been his own manager
save Kean. and he was the slave of
drink. Whv did Coquelin break away from
the Comedle Francaise? Because he was
too original, too forceful, to he controlled
by any man but himself. He felt, as every
man of power must ferl. that if he were
ever to bring out the best that was la
him he must work out his own destiny.
This our men of power can never do so
long as they are content to be "presented"
by enterprlsng speculators. Small WamÂ«*
to the speculator: but how about the self
respect of the artist?
Nothing less urgent than a demand from
Mrs. Pinero for immediate pin money, or
perhaps a whimsical desire to fool the
public to the top of its bent, could have
justified Mr. Pinero in putting his nanw
to the rubbish which makes up two-thirds
of "The Amazons." If hj? Is regardless of
his literary reputation It may not unjustly
be contended that the critics need not
worry themselves -about It. True, yet
surely it is a pity to see a man who could
create the characters of Paula Tanqueray
and the Duke of St. Olpherts satisfied to
split the ears of the groundlings by mak
ing fat men crawl through thin holes in
hedges and thin men bark their shins by
tumbling over horizontal bars. To call a
play a farcical romance does not make it
any the less a farce, and except for an
occasional clever touch In the atavistic re
membrances of Tweenwayes "The Ama
znns" Is just as much a farce as anything
of the De Souchet school.
The night I saw the play at the Califor
nia Miss Chapman made little effort to
carry her part with spirit, and considering
the "nature of that part one can hardly
blame her. Mr. Howard as Tweenwayes
easily carried off the honors, Mr. Neill'3
Herculean shoulders and deep organ-tone
voice quite unfitting him for such a very
light play. It yeems to me he would make
an ideal Captain Swift. Those who praise
him for his imitations of other actors do
him poor service. No man accomplishes
anything really goodâ not to say great â
by"being anything but himself.
"Considering the small price charged Mr.
Neill has been giving good performances
of fairly good plays. But h!s company
sterns overworked and tlrei out, and while
we shall be sorry to lose them I, for my
part, am glad to believe that they are go
ing to enjoy a well earned rest.
LDU PONT SYLE.
f~y* R- ARCHER tells us that some
III seven or eight years ago Mr.
I I I Ptnero was asked to mention some
I I "coming dramatist In whose fu
,-" ture he had faith." He picked out
Haddon Chambers. Thanks also to
the Indefatigable Archer, we can follow
Mr. Chambers and mark his advance from
the garish days of "Captain Swift" to the
more subdued and pleasanter lights of
"The Tyranny of Tears."
"Cantain Swift" is a melodrama pure
and simple; none the less a melodrama
because its scenes are laid in what Is sup
posed to be good society. The success of
that play was both fortunate and unfor
tunate for the authorâ fortunate in that
It brought him bread, butter and reputa
tion; unfortunate in that the said reputa
tion was of a kind highly undesirable for
a man who wanted to be something more
than a dramatic hack. But melodrama
made Mr. Chambers, and to melodrama
he was therefore enslaved for years. "The
Fatal Card" Is as full of harrowing sen
sationalism as a prize fight is full of
blows, and is padded with a comic "re
lief (poor word!) that is beneath con
tempt. "John-A-Dreams" shows an effort
to do something more artistic than to
strike off another chromo-lithograph at
the Adelphl Theater press; but you cannot
outline on zinc for years without injuring
that delicacy of touch required for tine
work on canvas. "John-A-Dreams," which
starts well as a character play, degener
ates into a mere series of "ieads-up" to a
melodramatic situation that Is worth
nothing when you get it. "Boy3 Together"
is a blood-curdler of the blood-curdlers,
wherein the hero skewers one of the vil
lain's hands to the table with a knife "in
order to torture him into signing with his
other hand a confession of his villainies."
In this incident, worthy of that "sancti
fied" king to whom the good bishops ded
icated their Bible, Mr. Chambers seemed
to have exhausted the possibilities of tho
horrible, for in his next play, "In the Days
of the Duke." a faVly fought duel was
the strongest thrill-producer he allowed
himself. Bushels of Adelphi sixpences
and shillings must by this time have made
Mr. Chambers independent of the London
caddies, for In "The Tyranny of Tears"
he has deliberately turned his back upon
them, and eschewing all sensational de
vices has made a direct appeal to intelli
gent people. Wonderfully successful is
this for a first appeal, when you consider
the kind of hack work the poor man has
been doing for the last ten years, and all
who love the stage must welcome this j.d
dition to the little band of playwrights,
numbering now some half-dozen, who fur
nish food for thought to the English
speaking world.
It is announced that Bernhardt and Co
quelin will descend upon our benighted
shores next November lor a farewell tour.
The plays are to be: (i
For Sarah â "I.'Aiglon." "Camille."
"Hamlet" and "La Tosca."
For Coouellnâ "Cyrano de Bergerac
and "Tartuffe."
If Coquelin would only come alone, how
much pleasanter It would be! For the
Duke of Reichstadt was a weakling about
whem it is impossible to make a strong
play "La Tosca" is a vile glorification of
the most brutal realism, and as for
"Hamlet"â there should be propriety in
all things. On the 22d of next October
Grandmamma Sarah will reach the re
spectable age of r.fi. Hamlet. I think,
would have had difficulty in looking that
age, and in spite of Mr. Donnelly I cannot
believe that he was written by Bacon or
that he was a woman.
Since Mr. Mansfield has grown rich
(and lazy), thanks to "Cyrano de Berge
rac." there seems to be not one manager
and bet one actor in the United States
with brains, courage and mor.ey enough
to take a little risk for the sake of orig
inal art. Ready-made pieces from Lon
don and adaptations of French farces
seem entirely satisfactory to the syndi
cate that controls our theatrical market.
As to the managers of the stock compa.
nies, from whom one might have hoped
for something better, they shrink from
the very mention of a new play as a cat
does from water.
The actor-manager system, with all ita
faults, is better than the system which
has reduced the American drama to its
present state of cadaveric rigidity. The
former system, while It too often pro
duces plays made to fit some particular
actor, does produce something original:
we produce practically nothing. There la
inducement for men of ability In our
country to become journalists and novel
ists, so journalism and n< vel writins
flourish: there is no indue ment for a
man who can make five dollars a day In
any other profession to turn playwright,
so we have almost no drama. And as Mr.
Meltzer recently pointed out. the few
playwrights we have-Mr. Thomas. Mr.
Carlton. Mr. Fitchâ have made no ad
vance during the last few years; he might
have added that Mr. Fitch has even gone
back.
Men write plays primarily because they
are born with an Instinct to express them
selves In dramatic form; the demand "or
their product cannot create the instinct,
but the instinct will not find expression,
or will find but scant expression, unless
there exists encouragement in the shape
of demand. In London this demand is
actively personified in a dozen actor-man
ftgera of independence and ability, such
as Sir Henry rrvins. George Alexander,
Mr. Tree. Mr. Kendal. Mr. Wyndham a'nd
Forbes Robertson. Without such men
Mr. Pinero would to-day be a second rate
actor, Henry Arthur Jones would be em
bopged in the sloughs of melodrama, Mr
Grundy would be merely a French farce
adapter. Mr. Carton a paragrapher and
Mr. Chambersâ I think he came from
Australia, so he would probably bo writ
ing advertisements for the Greater-Aus
tralia -Refrigerated - Beef - and - Mutton-
Shipping- Association.
Conditions in the United States to-day
are such that the actor-manager systf-m
is impossible exrept in local stock compa
nies. But thire are signs r: a breakup
In the once omnipotent syndicate, and if
that takes place such men as -John Drew.
Henry Miller and E. H. Sothern -the peers
of the best among the London actor-man
agersâmay be free to develop their own
careers. Competition among them will
cnate a healthy demand for r.atlvo work,
end It is more than probable that the
supply will be forthcoming.
"Paolo and Frajicesca." bv Stephen
Phillips, is the finest dramatic poem writ
ten In England since the death of Brown
ing. It is dedicated to George Alexander
an.I contains also this significant an
nouncement: "This play was commis
sioned by George Alexander and accepted
for production at the St. James Theater."
That seems to me a tolerably good result
of actor-managership. Can you imagine a
poem with a nassage like this:
O God. thou seest thy creatures bound
Tocether by that law which hold? the stars

THE WASTE OF WATER.
AT the meeting of the executive committee and
advisory council of the Water and Forest As
sociation on Friday the announcement was
made by President Thomas that good work has been
accomplished thus far; that contributions have been
so liberal hardly any more money is needed for pres
ent purposes, and that prospects for future work are
excellent; but that. there has been a failure in the
efforts to bring to the association the number of
members it should have in order to achieve all that is
desired for the public welfare.
It is strange that a lack of membership should be
the one defect of the association, since there is hardly
any other organization in the State whose purposes
affect so considerable a number of persons and whose
work will be of more benefit to all. It would be diffi
cult to find anj- large class of people in California who
are not more or less interested in the conservation of
the woods in our forests and the water in our streams.
These matters vitally concern the welfare of the
State, and the organization which has been formed
for the purpose of solving the problems of forestry
and of irrigation should count its active workers by
the thousands.
Ehvood Mead of the Department of Agriculture,
who has been investigating the problems of irriga
tion in California, gave in a short statement of his
examination of the subject a striking illustration of
the advantages of irrigation to our farmers and fruit
growers and of the ill results which have followed
the ina/lequate irrigation laws. Describing an irriga
tion district near Woodland he is quoted as saying:
"Under the ditch every form of flower and fruit which
can be produced in California is being successfully
grown, and the farms would attract settlers from any
agricultural district in this country. Above the ditch
I can count on the fingers of one hand the products
which seem to me to be a success, and a large popu
lation can neither be attracted nor supported if those
lands are to be farmed by the aid of rainfall alone."-
Mr. Mead went on to say: "The benefits of irriga
tion are recognized by every farmer with whom I
talked, yet there is only one ditch taking water from
the stream, and fully three times as much water was
passing the headgate as flowed through it; in other
words, three-fourths of the water was running to
waste. Not all of the water is wholly lost. A large
part of it sinks into the gravel of the river bed and
finds its way by percolation under the valley and is
then pumped up from depths varying from fifteen to
twenty-five feet. That is the situation in midsummer,
when the rains have ceased, but there are times when
the creek is a torrent, 300 feet wide and 15 feet deep.
At the head of the creek is a natural reservoir capable
of storing the floods and distributing them when
needed, but so long as the water which the stream
new carries is not made use of there is small en
couragement to provide a larger supply."
It is not from carelessness merely that full advan
tage is not taken of the water that is running to
waste in the district. Mr. Mead says: "There are
two canals built years ago which cover some of the
best lands in the valley, which for years have been
practically abandoned. An inquiry as to the cause of
this resulted in the same answer in both cases â con
ticversies over rights to water of the. riparian pro
prietors, controversies with rival appropriators and a
lack of harmony between water-users and ditch
owners."
Such is the condition of affairs in one locality, and
similar conditions can be found in many others in the
State. California needs a well-ordered system of ir
rigation and of forestry, and the association which
aims to provide that should have a liberal support, not
only by contributions of money, but by the co
operation of a large and active membership. Such
a membership ought to be promptly forthcoming.
COMPULSORY EDUCATION.
npHE most vital problem touched upon at the re-
I cent institute of the San Francisco teachers was
* that of compulsory education. And it is to be
regretted that it was only touched upon, not dis
cussed, s
The majority of parents who read this article arc
doubtless aware of the fact that the State of Califor
nia has an excellent compulsory education law; the
minority who know nothing of this law are pre
cisely those for whose benefit it is intended. For
them the very caption of the statute contains an ethi
cal lesson of vast importance, for "An act to enforce
the educational rights of children" implies the as
sertion of a corresponding duty on the part of
parents. Is the minority who are shirking the duty
imposed by the State a large one or a small one? If
large, the next Teachers' Institute might well devote
itself to the discussion of this question alone.
According to the last published report of the State
Superintendent of Public Instruction, the number of
white children in the State of California between the
ages of five and seventeen was 324,098. Of this num
ber only 270,740 were enrolled on the school registers
(249,335 in the primary and grammar grades of the
public schools, 21,405 in private schools). Now, the
difference between the number of census children and
the number enrolled in schools is 53,358. Where were
these fifty-three thousand children? Perhaps they
were educating their parents.
A closer study of the statistics brings out the dis
agreeable fact that this showing is eveif worse than
it appears. For of the 249,335 children enrolled in
the primary- and grammar grades only 1S7.93S (about
75 per cent) actually belonged to the schools. Allow
ing that every one of the 21,405 children in the private
schools was actually in attendance, we must still add
to the 53.358 who were never enrolled 61.397 who were
enrolled but who did not belong to the schools. This
gives us the appalling total of 114.755 children out of
324,098 â that is, nearly one-third the school popula
tion of the Stateâ who do not belong to any school,
public or private. Is it not about time that something
was done to enforce the compulsory education law?
Does the city of San Francisco make a better show
ing than the State at large? From the report of Su
perintendent Webster for the year ending June 30,
1807, we learn that the number of children between
5 and 17 who have attended public schools at any time
(luring the year was 46,871; private schools. 8501;
total. 55.372. The number of children between 5 and
17 who have not attended school at any time during
the school year was 19.46S. Nearly twenty thousand
children in the city of San Francisco growing up ig
norant of their duties and responsibilities as American
citizens!
It was to reach the parents of such poor waifs that
the Legislature passed the compulsory education law
of March 28, 1874. For more than a quarter of a cen
tury that law has been a dead letter on our statute
book, and its provisions must be so unfamiliar to
many that no apology need be made for dwelling on
them briefly here.
The language of the statute is absolutely manda
tory. It requires that the parent "shall be required"
to send his child to school for at least two-thirds of
the time during which a school is taught in his dis
trict; twelve weeks cf this time must be "consecu
tive." The president of the Board of Education is re
quired to post three notices of the law in the most
public places in the city or to publish the same for
three weeks, during ench June, in some newspaper.
Parents who fail to comply with the provisions of the
act are guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable for the
first offense with a line of twenty dollars and costs;
for the second offense not less than twenty dollars nor
more than fifty, with costs.
If this law could be enforced upon ail negligent
heads of families in San Francisco to-morrow, and if
the dollars collected were placed in a straight line
with their circumferences touching, they would
stretch along Market street a distance of two miles â
from the ferries to Franklin street. â¢
The duty of enforcing the law is placed pri
marily upon the clerk of the Board of Edu
cation, who, upon the written complaint of any
teacher or taxpayer, must prosecute any of
fender or be himself liable to the fine of
not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollars. The
census marshal is required not only to furnish the
Board of Education with complete lists of children of
school age, but also to note on such lists all children
not attending school who are liable to the provisions
of the act. The teacher "shall call such list each
morning on the opening of school," report the per
sistent absentees to the Board of Education, and "said
board shall therewith proceed to prosecute such
parents," etc.
Nothing could be clearer than the provisions of the
act. The responsibility for enforcing it, moreover, is
put exactly where it properly belongs, and the ex
pense is amply provided for by the heavy â but none
too heavy â fines collectable.
Citizens who may think the enforcement of this law
impossible must believe that the average of human
virtue and intelligence is higher in the State of Maine
than in the State of California, for the city of Portland
has a compulsory education law not dissimilar to
ours â and it is enforced.
Compulsory education has been carried further in
Germany than anywhere else, and it is from Germany
we can learn the most in attempting to enforce our
own law. In his book on European schools Dr. L.
R. Klemm tells us that in Prussia the process is sum
mary and effective. 'The father is summoned before
the Police Court and is called upon to explain. If no
satisfactory explanation is forthcoming the father is
fined. This fine is increased twice in case of back
sliding, and finally ends in imprisonment." The school
age is 6 to 13, the time requirement eight months in
the year. In cases of extreme poverty the State pro
vides necessaries. In Rhenish Prussia so thoroughly
has the law been enforced that of all the young men
drafted for military service less than three-tenths of
one per cent are illiterates.
These figures carry their own warning. A republic
based upon ignorance is as a house builded upon the
sand.
We turn to the last Federal census and we find that
in the United States in 1890 the illiterates numbered
over six millions â thirteen and one-third per cent of
the population.
THE SAN FRAjSTCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 27, 1900.
After all the howls of economy, the darkening of
streets, the squirming of economists, the city will
have a deficit after all. Why not pawn the Hall of
Justice to a collector of curios and raise enough
money to run the city government for a few days?
Even the most optimistic believer in the future of
Cape Nome must now be apprehensive of serious evil.
The Standard Oil Company has decided to invade the
town and tap the district.
The muddle Into which the courts have thrown our
pugilistic parasites is a .reasonably safe indication that
we will not suffer after all from the threatened raid
of the New York "pugs."
The City Fathers have decided that freak advertise
ments in San Francisco will no longer be tolerated.
Can this be a covert attack upon that Phelan folly
known as our municipal flag?
Local officials, under the ingenious guidance of the
Mayor, have been caught times without number in
efforts to throw dust in the eyes of the public, but
the most flagrant endeavor is involved in the threat to
leave city streets unswept during the month of June.
The improvement clubs of.the city are again insist
ing that our municipal administration is not only ex
pensive but worthless. The clubs should remember
that his Honor the Mayor is an expensive luxury,' for
awhile at least.
While the City Fathers are concerning themselves
with the preservation of the forests of Santa Cruz
and San Matco they might spare a few minutes to
an effort to get San Francisco out of the woods of
darkness into which the policy of Mayor Phelan has
thrown it.

KNIGHTS OF HONOR
TO HAVE AN OUTING
Well Known Business Man and Poli
tician Succumbs After an Ill
ness of Months.
Captain "William R. A. Johnson, â¢well
known in local business and political cir
cles, died at his home in Santa Clara on
Friday last. Captain Johnson's death was
not unexpected. He had been 111 for many
months, and although he continued active
until two weeks ago his friends had long
noted the approach of dissolution. He
finally bade his friends in this city good
by and returned to his home, fully con
scious that the sands of his life had near*
ly run. A few days ago he lapsed into a
semi-conscious condition, which only end
ed In his death. It Is said that an afflic
tion of the kidneys was the Immediate
cause of death.
Captain Johnson was a native of Ken
tucky. He came to San Francisco thirty
five years ago and entered the mercantile
field. On the organization of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company he secured the
position ofpurchasing agent for the cor
poration. This position he held until the
reorganization of the company five years
ago. He then went Into politics and se
cured an office as deputy under the Coun
ty Clerk, which position he held until two
Â¦weeks ago, when illness took him to his
home. His wife survives him.
WILLIAM R. A. JOHNSON
DIES IN SANTA CLARA
Accused Principal Will Not Admit
That He Signed Message Sent
From Restaurant.
The first witness called when the trial
of Principal Kilpatrick was resumed yes
terday before the Board qf .Education was
Superintendent Ackerman of the messen
ger company. He Identified the stub
elgned "Kulpatrick" as having been re
ceipted at the Poodle Dog restaurant for
a message alleged to have been received
by Vice l-'rlncipal Foulkes. The message
informed Foulkes that Kilpatrick was en
joying himself at the restaurant, and if
any School Directors called at the Busi
ness Evening School to let him know. Thia
message had been characterized by Kilpat
rick as a forgery, and it was for the pur
pose of determining that point that the
trial was reopened.
General Barnes tried to prove by Ack
erman that any stranger might go in the
restaurant and ring up for a messengei
and be at liberty to lorge another per
son's name. Ackerman admitted that the
messenger call box was not exclusive.
Frederick "Welhe, another official, testl
lied that after a thorough investigation
he failed to find any record of a message
sent by Kilpatrick January* 2, 1S98.
Kilpatrick was asked to write his name
for the purpose of comparison. He stated
that he never wrote his name "Kulpat
rick." as It was spelled on the message
and the stub. When asked If it were hla
signature Kilpatrick said he did not know-
He said that he had never been in the
Poodle Dog restaurant during school
hours. He also testified that he had never
absented himself from his school and that
he had never left it in charge of his wife.
Foulkes, who claimed to have received
the message from Kilpatrick, claimed
that the latter's signature on the message
was genuine, and that the reason why it
was Illegible and spelled wrongly was that
Kilpatrick was intoxicated at the time he
wrote it. Foulkes saw Kilpatrick later In
the evening and said that his face was
flushed and he gave other evidences of
having been drinking.
The board took the matter under advise
ment and will render a decision in a few
days.
KILPATRICK TRIAL

railroads owned by estates, which bonds
had never been assessed before. From the
records In the Probate Court the sum of
$29S,0OO In such bonds belong to the late
Theresa Fair and $713,000 to that of James
G. Kair. The executors of the estate re
fused to pay taxes en these bonds and
brought suit to determine the Issue. As
a consequence the total amount of the
personal property taxes against the James
G. Fair estate, amounting to $10S,52S, was
held up in litigation. Of this amount the
taxes on bonds of quasi-public corpora
tions were held to be illegal, but $44,354
Is now due the city on the bonds of East
ern corporations owned by the estate with
the added penalty of 15 per cent, which
increases the amount to over $51,000. The
Theresa Fair estate owes about $13,000,
making the total sum due J69.OOO. of which
the city will receive $13,000. This will be
utilized In meeting the estimated munici
pal deficit of $70,000.
Eecent Supreme Court Decision Will
Enrich City Treasury to the
Extent of $43,0O0.
Under the terms of a recent Supreme
Court decision the sum of $63,000 will
shortly be collected from the estates of
the late James G. Fair and his wife, Mrs.
Theresa Fair. The portion of a lengthy
decision bearing on the subject recites:
"Bonds of a foreign corporation owned
by a resident of this State but the paper
evidence of which is without the State
have locality for purposes of taxation at
the place where they are ownedâ the res
idence of the owner."
Assessor Dodge placed an assessment
in 1S99 of Sl.Oll.uOO on bonds of Eastern

The smokers of the islands will suffer
when the change takes place. Manila
cigars are used almost altogether there
and cost now from 2 to 4 cents each. The
American tariff will mo* than double the
price. It is understood that the big deal
ers in Honolulu have also taken this into
consideration and have laid in a very large
stock of Manilas, storing them in their
warehouses. As the price of cigars will
be raised immediately, the dealers expect
to make a nice clean-up on their specula
tion, while Uncle Sam will again be out
of pocket.
Uncle Sam loses a good many thousand
dollars In revenue by Hxing upon June 14
as the day for the new revenue laws to
go into effect in the Hawaiian Islands.
Every ton of freight dutiable under the
laws of Hawaii and now awaiting ship
ment that can possibly be held back is
being stored in warehouses, awaiting the
removal of the Hawaiian tariff. For
months the rush of freight to the islands
has been so great that it has almost been
considered a favor to get a transportation
company to accept freight. Just now It
is different, for shipping men all along the
front feel the falling off of orders.
The Honolulu Automobile Company Is
taking advantage of the approaching sus
pension of the tariff laws of Hawaii. It
has $60,000 worth of automobile hacks and
carriages stored away at Port Costa,
which will not be shipped until after the
change Is made. It is estimated that the
saving in duty on that one shipment will
amount to over $12,CK)U. This is only one
instance. There are hundreds of thou
sands of dollars' worth of goods held here
in the same way. After the 14th of June
a big congestion of freight is anticipated.
There is a certain amount of hurry-up
orders that are being sent down right
away, necessaries that the stores must
have. When Hawaii becomes a Territory
it is expected that the prices of all com
modities will be cut considerably.

Mayor Phelan went out to the lodge at
Golden Gate Park yesterday afternoon to
advocate his pet scheme of turning the
lodge into a branch of the public library.
Intyiew of the fact that the full Board of
Park Commissioners was not present the
matter did not come up except Informally.
Those present were Commissioners
Spreckels, Stanton and McDonald. It was
decided to take up the lodge library
scheme next Wednesday evening, when
all the members of the board will meet
at the Bohemian Club to listen to what
the Mayor has to say on the subject and
possibly take some action.
The Commissioners yesterday heard the
statement of Major Boxton, representing
property owners, in reference to the Im
provement of the hospital lot as a park
addition. In this connection a report was
made by Superintendent McLaren con
cerning the estimated cost of improving
that tract for park purposes. He iigured
out that the cost, including grading, lay-
Ing and macadamizing walks, loam foi
plantation, piping and variegating tha
surface by rough mounds, etc., of rock,
would be about $9350. or $2500 less without
the rock ornamentation.
Several other matters also came before
the board. The superintendent submitted
an account of the work performed re
cently. He said that the new music stand
was nearly finished, and that it would bb
necessary to purchase about 3W0 benches
to accommodate auditors. He suggested
that a walk should be graded to the new
music grounds from Ninth avenue. He
had planned two walks. The shorter, be
tween the points mentioned, would neces
sitate a tunnel under the driveway so that
the people might cross without interfer
ing with the carriages during concerts.
He also recommended planting an avenue.
of deciduous trees from Twenty-fourth
avenue on the north of the park to Nine
teenth avenue on the south.
The question concerning automobiles in
the park went over for one week. Gar
field Post, G. A. R., was given permission
to decorate the Garlield monument next
Wednesday. Action concerning the set
ting aside of Columbia Square as a play
ground was deferred.
Commissioners Will Take
Up the Matter Next
Wednesday.

sell you his real, bona-fide, highest

belt for 910.00. There's no framl
about these. You want no imitation,
no fantastic models. Call on trie and I

I can do to mind my own business. I'm

In addition to the commission of 1 per
cent on the par value of the stock the
California Oil and Stock Exchange
charges a fee of one-eighth of 1 per cent
for handling stocks of unproductive com
ganies. This, of cours/Â«. is paid by the
uyer and seller and not by the brokers,
whos=e commission of 1 per cent on the par
value of the stock is as fixed as the laws
of the Medes and Persians. In order to
enforce the decree in regard to commis
sions the governing board of the Califor
nia Oil nnd Stock Exchange has enacted
a rule that any broker found to be cutting
his commission of 1 per cent on the par
value of the stock Fhould be lined a sum
not less than $25 (maximum indefinite) and
stand suspended until the fine had been
paid.

Reed Oil Company.
Sinking oil wells In California, accord
ing to the Los Angeles Herald, is child's
play compared with some Eastern work
in the same line. There Is a well twenty
five miles from Pittsburg, In the Monon
gahela Valley, for Instance, that is down
&532 feet. But even at that depth It is not
an oil well. Several months ago a drill
with 1000 feet of rope dropped to the bot
tom and they have been llshlng for that
material ever since. The owners expect
to go to the depth of &XK) feet If they suc
ceed in clearing the hole.
Kern County and Summerland have
been selected by the oil company organ
ized by, and principally composed of,
women for their operations. The only
man who figures prominently in the com
pany is Mr. Hawgood, the consulting en
gineer. The women have a location of
220 acres in Kern County and forty acres
In the Kewhall district, adjoining the well
known White oil fields. Their stock books
were only opened about ten days ago, but
they have succeeded in getting subscrip
tions for about TOW shares. Their capitali
zation Is for $300,000.

some respects, the California Miners' As

Francisco, and Borne meetings have re

member of the California. Miners' Asso

past in securing legislation favoring the

Improved Order of Red Men*
The opening of the session this morn
ing was enlivened by a discussion of the
amendment to the Peoria Overture,
which was offered by Rev. Richard D.
Harlan of Rochester, N. Y.. Just prior
to adjournment yesterday afternoon. It
resulted in the withdrawal of the amend
ment. ,
The committee on vacancy and supply
recommended that the assembly refer
back to the committee that part of the
report referring to the bureau of infor
mation and adopt thÂ© sections' of the re
port which the assembly considered dur
ing the early sessions. It was so ordered.
Reports were made by the various com
mittees on synodical records, the greater
part of them being approved.
Rev. Hugh K. Walker, 1>.D., of the
synod of California, chairman of the
committee on districting the Bynods of
the Presbyterian church of the United

PRESBYTERIANS
CONCLUDE THEIR
ANNUAL SESSION
During the Debate a Demand Is
Made That Bishop McCabe
Leave the Floor of the
Hall.
CHICAGO, May 26.â By a close vote and
after a debate which exceeded In bitter
ness and feeling anything: yet heard dur
ing the session, the Methodist General
Conference practically decided to-day to
make no change in the attitude of the
church in regard to card-playing, dancing,
theater-going and other forms of amuse
ment which, since 1S72, have been under
the ban. Preceding the vote to accept the
minority report, which recommends that
no action be taken, the conference at
times was in a state of wild disorder,
due mainly to attempts to amend the
se'etion of the Book of Discipline under
discussion, and some exceedingly sharp
language was indulged In by the angry
delegates before the vote was taken.
A long list of standing committees of
the church and a committee to select del
egates to attend the Ecumenical Congress
In. London in 1901 were agreed upon by
the conference.
Rev. W. P. Thlrkleld. formerly general
secretary of the Epworth League, was
declared elected as one of the secretaries
of the Freedmen's Aid and Southern Edu
cational Society.
Dr. L. V. Gill of New Haven. Conn.,
editor of the Daily Advocate, published
here during the sessions of the conference,
was declared elected to the editorship or
the Western Christian Advocate, and Dr.
C. B. Spencer, formerly editor of the
Rocky Mountain Advocate, to the editor
ship of the Central Christian Advocate.
II. IC Carroll, formerly editor of the
New York Independent, was elected as
sistant secretary of the Missionary So
ciety.
Dead Letter in Church Law.
Report No. 7 of the committe* on the
state of the church. Involving the stand
ing of the Methodist church on dancing,
card playing and other prohibited amuse
ments, which was presented yesterday,
was then taken up. The galleries were
crowded with spectators. L>r. B. P. Ray
mond of Boston spoke in support of the
majority report.
"The regulation Itself Is a dead letter
over a large part of our church," he said.
"It cultivates duplicity and thus under
mine the fundamental principle of truth
in our church. Thus we compromise all
other virtues."
Dr. Raymond also said that from the
study of pedagogy a point could be made
In favor of taking the ban from the
amusements. "We strike a point about
the sixteenth year of age where the will
appears," he said. "If we would follow
nature we cannot build a fence around
man. for he rebels."
Dr. Gray of Williamsport, Pa., also
spoke in favor of the majority report.
Dr. Buckley was then recognized.
"The Jesuits, Lutherans and Church of
England never allow the people to dance
or to go to the theater for forty days dur
ing Lent, but they do not have any laws
on the subject, " he said. "It is not said
to any man 'Thou shalt not,' bur. the
moral force of the body, together with tha
religious exercises, cause their people to
abstain during Lent. I believe Mehodists
can abstain all the year. The putting of
this list in the presence of young peoplo
is a foe to sound, genuine conversion."
Dr. J. "W. Bashford argued for the ma
jority, saying it Intended no difference in
principle, but pimply a different method.
Amid a wild clamor for recognition the
previous question was ordered.
Frank Arter of New Jersey then put the
conference Into an uproar by starting to
read an amendment proposing to insert
in paragraph 243 "opera, grand opera,
prizetiphts, bullfights, cockfights, check
ers, backgammon, football, baseball, one
old cat, two old cat." Here his voice was
drowned by flfty delegates springing to
their feet and demanding recognition,
while cries of "Outrage on the confer
ence!" "We won't listen to the ridicule of
a rule of this church!" were heard.
The chair ruled that Mr. Arter was
In order, and he proceeded, amid hand
clapping and stamping of feet.
Attack on Bishop McCabe.
The conference was again thrown Into
turmoil by a demand that Bishop McCabe
leave the floor.
"He has no right on the floor of this
body endeavoring to Influence persons in
their voting," said Dr. Buckley hotly.
"I was here on private business," re
torted Bishop McCabe.
"You were not. You told me to with
draw my motion," shouted Mr. Arter.
Amid the confusion Mr. Arter then with
drew his amendment, and the angry dele
gates settled In their seats to hear the
closing argument in favor of the majority
report by Governor Pattlson. A demand
for an aye and nay vote on the question
was carried.
It was evident before the close of the
roll call that the minority report would
carry. Unofllrlal counts made It about 320
in favor and 200 ngainst the adoption. The
conference adjourned for the day without
hearing the official result.

Very Rev. Father Rooker, private sec

Cathedral this morning. The apostolic
delegate will attend the services. i
There has never been such a scarcity
of sailors on the water front as at the
present time. British ship captains are
offering $40 "blfiod money," but their ves
sels are lying In the stream unmanned.
There Is only one fully manned Britisher
Jn the bay and that is the Blackbracs.
She was 355 days getting here from Eng
land. There Is not a man aboard who
has - less than $150 coming to him. The
sailor boarding-house runners have been
out to the ship in dozens, have tried all
kinds of tricks to get the mten to desert
and have failed. Jack knows full well
that before he was two hours ashore he
would be drunk and then in short order
he would be aboard another vessel and
bound for Liverpool. . â¢Â¦
At the present time there are five ships
lying in the stream, loaded with wheat,
awaiting crews. The Bardowie wajits 13
men, the Sierra Pedrosa 10 men. the Prim
rose Hill 16 men, the Indore 12 men and
the Kensington 16 men. The American
ship Iroquols was also in want of a crew,
but the captain agreed to pay $40 a month
and after waiting three days the ship
finally went to sea. The Iroquois goes
from here to Puget Sound and thence to
Honolulu with a load of lumber.
Circumnavigating the Globe.
The British ship Musselcrag, now out
312 days from "Antwerp for San Francisco,
is having if anything a harder time of it
than the Blackbraes, which was 355 days
coming here from Newcastle, Eng. Both
vessels were caught In the hurricane that
raged off Cape Horn in October last. Both
vessels were badly damaged, but while
the Blackbraes put into Port Stanley for
repairs the Musselcrag turned tail and
ran for the Cape of Good Hope. The
coast of Australia was reached early in
January and Captain Johnston signaled
Cape Otway that he had lost nearly a
whole suit of sails; that the bulwarks were
stove In and the decks swept. A week
later, finding that he could not make any
headway, the Musselcrag put into Â¦ Syd-f
ney, NV S. W. She was overhauled and
sailed again for San Francisco on Febru
ary 25. She is out 91 days to-day and
shipping men are beginning to get a little
anxious about her. The chances are that
the vessel's hull is very foul and that she
Is making very slow progress through the
water. Captain Johnston ' Is making his
first voyage in the Musselcrag. . When
last here he was master of the ship Har
land and was accompanied by his wife
and family.
No More Quarantine.
In future the sugar boats will be al
lowed to dock instead of going into quar.
antine and remaining there until fumi
gated. The barkentine Irmgard. 20 days,
and. the bark Amy Turner, 25 days from
Hllo, arrived in port yesterday and as
soon as the quarantine officer passed .them
they went to the sugar refinery. This
will* be glad news for the masters of the
sugar fleet, who were sometimes kept- at
Angel Island for a week before they got
a ; chance to set a foot ashore.
Water Front g Notes.
The ' Merchants' Ejrohange received
word yesterday .that the cargo of the
French bark Normandle is a total loss.
The vessel left here with â¢ a , full load of
wheat and when rounding the Horn
struck on some rocks near the- Falkland
Islands.' The hull is now submerged and
the wheat ruined.' â¢ . .
A detachment of the Naval Battalion

Board of Directors Decide That Sub
scriptions Should Not Be Lim- .
ited to Union Men.
The board of directors of the Labor
Temple Association, which is to be In
corporated next week for the purpose of
building a $200,000 temple for labor, held
a meeting at 915 Market street last night.
President E. L. Malsbary was In the chair.
Good progress in the work of securing
stock subscriptions was reported.
The propriety of permitting laboring
men outside of union jnen who have no
unions in their craft to subscribe for stock
was thoroughly discussed. It was agreed
that the Temple should be built by labor,
without the assistance of moneyed men,
ar.d that the stock of the association
should never pass beyond the control of
laboring men, but upon the motion of J.
E. McL>ougald it was vote'd as the sense
of the board that the stock books should
be open to men who do not belong to j
unions and some other classes of outsiders
as a matter of busines policy.
Director William Layden pffered a sug
gestion, which also met with the ap
proval of the board, that the Labor Coun
cil and Labor Trades Council should be
requested to officially notify the unions
under them of the project under way and
to recommend that they subscribe for
stock, both as unions and individually,
as a good investment.
The chair appointed William Layden

Superintendent Mather of the Plumbago
mine at Moores Flat. Nevada County,
has bought the Oriental mine at Alle
gheny. Sierra County, and will run a tun
nel K'.M feet to drain the mine.
Miners are getting ready to wingdajn
alor.g the Klamath River, which is now
low and will be low all the summer, as
there is little snow in the mountains. The
season will be good for river mining and
i the river can also be worked with a
dredger.
Superintendent Carlin of the Rhode
Island Callahan of the Mississippi and
Phillips of the Phillips mine in Tuol
lumne County, propose to dam the Tuo
lumne River at the Phillips mine to fur
nish power for the mines i)i Big Oak Flat
and Groveland. The Big Betsy mine in
1 Tuolumne Countv has oombined with the
! Slapjack and the latter will be developed,
using the machinery taken from, the Big
Betsy.
A ditch three miles long will be dug for
the Golden Hill mine at Powellton, Butte
County.
The Gold Lake mine at Johnsville. Plu
mas County, has been bonded by B. H.
Bancroft of San Francisco.
The Kinyon mine at Randsburgr has
leased an eight-stamp mill at Garlock, to
which ore will be hauled.
The Amador I-edger says that prepara
tions are making to sink on the Altarte
property without delay.
The old shaft of the Bunker Hill mine,
Amador County, which is about 800 feet
deep, has been cleaned out to a depth of
350 feet and the work Is continuing at the
rate of about 100 feet per month.
Carewe (Mr. Goodwin), whose sole ambi
tion is to carry out the wishes of his for
mer friend. Phyllis Ericson (Miss Elliott*,
the daughter of another old companion,
has also been a ward of Richard Carewe
and Richard arranged an engagement be
tween his two charges. The boy, however,
accidentally forms tne acquaintance of
an actress, with whom he becomes madly
infatuated and secretly becomes engaged.
His four guardians, learning of the boy's
entanglement, endeavor to save him, but
before they can carry out their plans the
two. are married. The situations which
follow are exciting throughout, especially
as the boy soon realizes his folly.
OVER fifty people are concerned in
)the Goodwin-Ellictt production of
'the latest success, "When We Were
Twenty-one," which is to be staged
here for the first time next Monday night
at the Columbia. Theater-goers of this
city will be among the first outside ot
New York to see the much-praised play.
At no time have Mr. Goodwin and Miss
Elliott been favored- with greater opportu
nities. In the role of Dick Carewe Mr.
Goodwin does the most artistic and fin
ished work of his career. The part Is said
to be one of the most sympathetic he has
portrayed in years and it is acted with
that fascinating skill which is always at
Mr. Goodwin's command. Miss Klliott
has never been seen to better advantage.
The role of Phyllis Ericson is so replete
with buoyancy and tenderness " that It
brings her audience to her feet in an in
stant. The Eastern critics are unanimous
on the point that the new Goodwin-Elliott
plav is above all gentle and refined. It is
replete with humor and tells a story that
is original in the extreme. Four men.
who have been lifelong friends, assume
the guardianship of a youth whose father
had died twenty years previous to the ac
tion of the play ar.d whose Bon had been
placed under the special care of Richard

The recent hearing before Brigadier
General "Warfleld of the protest of mem
bers of Company K of the First Regi
ment against the action of MajÂ«r Hendy,
who presided at the election of officers of
that company, in refusing to allow the
name of E. M. O'Riellcy to be voted for
as candidate- for the position of captain
Is another argument in favor of the re
vision of the "red book," in which are
contained the regulations and rules for
the government of the State militia, but
which has been denominated in official
documents "the worst combination of mis
information ever placed between two cov
ers." The particular case â¢ referred to
brought out the fact that at an election
Otto .Schwerdtfeger- was chosen captain
of the company and O'Rielley was chosen
first lieutenant, but both failed after two
trials to qualify before the examining
board. The red bock says that one who
failed to qualify for a commission cannot
appear for the same commission again
within six months. Relying upon this at
the next election O/RIeiley appeared
as a candidate for captain of the
company and Schwerdtfeger as a
candidate for first lieutenant. Majoi
Hendy. believJng that a man who could
not qualify as first lieutenant certalnly
could not within a month after rejection
qualify for the higher position of captain,
construed the intention of the regulation
to mean that within six months after re
jection by the board a disqualified Indi
vidual cannot be a candidate for any com
i mission. It will now remain^ for the ad
jutant general to pass judgment on tht
ruling of Major Hendy.
Said a member of Company F of the
First Regiment as he pointed to the order
for the parade on the 30th lnst: "It Is
highly creditable, is it not, for orders to
include such a paragraph as this: 'En
listed men who have no uniforms will re
port at the same time and place and pa
rade In civilian dress.'? It is not much
credit to the National Guard to have it go
out that a regiment is unable to turn out
in uniform." A member of the uniform
board, in explanation of this condition of
affairs, said the fault is not with the
board but with the regiment itself, for
being so slow in sending in requisitions
for uniforms. Such, he said, could not be
furnished without the board knowing
what was wanted. If the men, he said,
are without uniforms it is their fault and
not that of the board. Some of the com
panies have already received uniforms
and the others will be furnished as soon
as they can be made up.

A strong rffort will be made to have
the Mining Congress, that will soon meet
ct Milwaukee, AJrge the establishment of
a Federal Department of Mines and Min
ing. The plan has no opposition. Since
the idea was first suggested in The Call
tome jreexs ago the mining enterprises in
vrh'.ch citizens of the Uiiit<*d States are
concerned have preatly extended. Many
new questions have arisen. While other
wealth-producing activities may run
aJor.g without any further Government
oversight and assistance, there is no ques
tion that, the proposed department is
net-ded. The necessity hap been recog
nized by the miners successively in ses
sion at Denver and Salt Lalce. The min
ing laws also will probably be discussed
at Milwaukee-. Very likely the conditions
existing at Cape Nome will come In for
attention.
The exodus to the north that began in
1S9T ar.d is now as gTeat as ever ia, in the
opinion of the mining prcs?, raising an
', important question concerning a supply
lot tkilled miners to take the places that
4he outgoing miners leave vacant. Their
'departure is a manifest loss to the mining
industry of the Slates from which they
Â¦go. Undoubtedly the press is right in as
Â¦ Kuminp that the work of development at
home will go on just the fame.

At the closing session of the congress
yesterday forenoon . W. G. Puddefoot of
Boston, speaking on "The , Work of the
Church in Winning Souls," said that win
ning souls was the business of the church
but the church had not always minded Its
business. It had fought against the new
astronomy, the new geology, Darwinism
and other things; The main thing was
not to explain about where 'Jain hia
wife or about Jonah In' tho whale's belly,
but to persuade men to believe In the Lord
Jesus Christ. . That was the essential
point. Imagine a hungry man refusing. to
eat bread -until he had learned all\ Its
chemical properties. â¢ ' Â¦Â¦

said, must be filled with thought. Man
would know science and history better
than he will religion' Just as long as
science- and history were taught, better.
Churches . contain I many I puny Christians,
and it was often the fault of the ministers
that the pews were empty. ; Men must be
taught something and the pulpit must
think. Thought and brooding must lead

Amuck in the Western
DRINK-CRAZED
"COP" SHOOTS
AT A SPECIAL
Policeman Boukofsky, while 'suffering
from an overindulgence in liquor, ran
amuck last night in the vicinity of Jack
son and Lyon streets.
After terrorizing P. O. Drlscoll, a grip
man, whom he Imagined was a footpad,
ho took a shot at Special Officer Helbush
for no other reason than that the special
refused to obey - his command to throw
up his hands! Fortunately the bullet went
wldo of Its mark. -As he again tried to
pull the trigger Helbush grabbed the re
volver and vainly endeavored to disarm
the frenzied policeman.
The. pistol shot attracted the attention
of Policeman Curry, and seeing the two
men struggling for the possession of the
weapon he drew his club and cracked
Boukofsky over the head, forcing him to
release his hold on the revolver. Although
partly stunned from the effects of the
blow, Boukofsky attacked Curry, but was
quickly subdued with the aid of the lo
cust. He was then handcuffed and taken
to the City Prison, where he was locked
up in the Â¦ tanks. He will be formally
charged to-day with an assault to commit
murder. - - '
, Boukofsky,* who is attached to the north
end station, reported off duty at noon yes
terday. After leaving the station he vis
ited a number of saloons In the Western
Addition, and it wasjnoticed that he was
intoxicated. *
Shortly after 10 o clock last night Dris
coll the gripman, was pafjing through a
vacant lot near Jackson and Lyon streets
on his way home when he was J startled
by a command to halt. Turning around
he was confronted by Boukofsky, who
wore his star, pinned to the lapel of his
coat The drunken policeman had his pis
tol in his hand, and as he was within a
few steps of the. astonished gripman he
ordered him to throw up his hands.

L. Ctnter, chairman of the committee ap

the Supervisors, stated' that much good
had already been accomplished In cur
tailing the extravagance of 'the Board of
Public Works and -the Health Depart
ment. In view of the provisions of the
charter, he Introduced the following,
which was adopted:
We hereby draw the attention of the Super
visors to the fact that by authority of article
II. chapter 2. section 1. rub-section 22 of the
charter, they are permitted to make a special
generaf plan, beyond the $1 limit, and we rec
ommend that this be done, so that more money
may be appropriated for other permanent Im
provements.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the secretaries of affiliated
clubs should call the attention of the members
of their clubs to the importance of aiding the
census enumerators, who will be engaged In
canvassing the city during the first two weeks
of June, and furnish them with such Informa
tion that will assist them In gettins an exact
count of the city's population. ?
C. F. Kimball of the Nuevo Potrpro
Club spoke of the necessity of removing
the County Hospital to some other sec

Board of Health was urged to select the

by the Falrmount Improvement Club.
IF Father Torke has attacked the two
universities of California arid thn
school system of the State I know
nothing of it. I have not read this
morning's pnper and know absolutely
nothing of the stand taken by either
Father Yorke or President Jordan of Stan
ford University.
I thoroughly believe in the smaller col
leges, as I think they do their work aa
well as the larger institutions. As to the
remarks made ly President Jordan, if ho
did"- make them. I cannot answer. They
are. of course, his affiir. Some of our
greatest men are graduates of small col
leges, and I see no reaann why they should
not 'oiler nearly as good. 1* not as good,
curricula as many of the socalled great
institutions.
I do not think the teachers of the public
schools of this State should be chosen
only from the graduates of the University
of California and Stanford University. I
think thai would be. entirely unreasonable
and without method. I holieve the public
schools should stand by themselves. They
should stand alone and by their own
worth to the community. Every man is
privileged to h!s own opinion, and if Dr.
Jordan gave it u? his opinion that positions
in our school departments should be tilled
by graduates ef the two California uni
versities, to the exclusion of all others.
: that is only his opinion. My opinion 19
otherwise.
It is utterly impossible for me to give
an off-hand discussion of so Important a
question, and as I have nnt thought of It
or read Father Yorke's address I am in no
position to give a good interview on thÂ©
subjects in question.
AUDITOR'S BUDGET
UP FOR DISCUSSION
SHE alleged quotations are not from
anything I have ever said. I believe
that" the "small college has a very
Important place in education, so long
â¢ as its work is honestly done. If It
pretends to do what it has not the
means to do it impairs its own integrity.
There is no virtue in bigness, but there is
virtue in the strength to do what one pre
tends to do.
The university should welcome all re
ligious Influences as an adjunct to its
work, or as the formative spirit of its
work, but poor work is not made good by
being done under religious auspices. I
am sure that the large universities have
not the slightest desire to monopolize edu
cation or to exclude men trained elsewhere
from the privileges of scholarship. But
they believe that trained men are better
than untrained ones for the specific pur
poses of life. It, is. their business to train
men. Because they meet the needs of
many is the reason why they have many
students.
As for the . university which ''would
measure God's mercy with a yardstick
and weigh it on the tipping balance of a
grocer's scales," I have never mat such in
my travels. â¢ It Is a. mere figure of speech.
The university exists for "the discovery
and dissemination of truth." and every
one who comes within speaking distance
of truth is a better man for the expo-'
rience.
It, is. of course, not true that "the cry to
take the public schools out of the hands
of the politicians is dishonest." or that it
is a cloak for some one's desire to control
them for himself. What we call "politics
in the schools" is simply the attempt of
certain persons to put their own relatives
or dependents into places designed for real
teachers. This is not politics. It is sim
ply personal corruption, and every good
citizen who understands the situation,
whether in a university or out, should
stand by the School Board of San Fran
cisco in Its efforts .to eradicate this evil.
The public schools are not corrupt be
cause they are public or because they are
secular. When they fail in this regard It
Is because of the lack of educated public
sentiment. The university would be rec
reant to Its duty If it did not do its part
to form such sentiment.

short distance, during which Boukofsky
kept Driscoll covered with his revolver,
the gripman tripped him up and ran into
a garden. He took refuge behind a tree,
hoping that the liquor-crazed policeman
would not discover him. With an oath
Boukofsky followed him, and discovering
him hiding behind the tree ordered him
to ''come out" or take a chance on going
to the Morgue. As Boukofsky kept his
revolver trained on him. Driscoll. realiz

him, agreed to go with him. Â¦

Boukofsky fired at him. The aim was un

over the special's head. It wa3 at this
Juncture that Policeman Curry showed

Â¦MARRIES, A. CONCERT SINGER
He Says the Youth Swore Falsely to
Obtain a License to Make An-
Pnette Lucky George His
Bride.
A 19-year-old boy's infatuation for a
blonde concert singer several >ears his
senior may be the means of sending him
to State's prison on a charge of perjury.
Herbert O. Lowry of this city obtained a
warrant yesterday afternoon In Oakland
for the arrest of his brother, Russell K.
Lowry, whom he accuses- of swearing
falsely when he took out a license Friday
to marry Miss Annette Lucky George.
The eider Lowry claims that his brother
perjured himself when he certified in the
presence of Deputy County Clerk Brown
ing of Oakland that lie was 22 years old
and the blushing-bride-to-be but IS.
The irate brother of the young man
called yesterday afternoon at the Dis
trict Attorney's office, and after a
long consultation with â¢ Deputy Phil
Walsh of Alameda County swore to a
complaint charging the would-be benedict
with perjury. He paid that Russell was
but 19 years old and the woman had seen
more than the eighteen years named in
his brother's affidavit. To Deputy Walsh
he stated that both of the young people
have been employed as singers in various
San Francisco concert halls. Several
rrionths ago they met and each became in
fatuated with the other.
The pleadings of the young man's moth
er induced him to forsake his sweetheart,
but the blonde singer again won his af
fections. Finally Lowry was induced to
sign an affidavit to the effect that he was
being hounded by Miss George. This doc
ument was shown the woman by Herbert
Lowry, with the hope that she could thus
be' Induced to forsake the object of her
affections. â¢Â¦
For a time the couple kept apart, but
Friday they went to Oakland di
reqtly to the office of the County Clerk,
where young Lowry asked for a marriage
license. AVhen Mrs. Lowry, the mother of
the youth, learned what had happened.,
she became hysterical and now lies at her
home in a precarious condition. The elder
brother, Herbert, was more logical, and
concluded that Russell would be better
off in jail than as the husband of Annette
Lucky George.
The warrant for Russell Lowry s arrest
was placed In the hands of a Constable.
It is presumed that the ceremony was
performed by some Oakland clergyman
who had not tiled the certificate up to last
night. The couple returned to this city
and went to the rooms occupied by the
bride at 402 Turk street. Lowry evidently
feared the wrath of his relatives, for he
remained with his bride but a few hours,
when he departed hastily for Placer
County.
The relatives of young Lowrj' are deter
"mlne<r~t<r r prevent*nlm from living with
the woman. After causing a warrant to
.be issued in Oakland for his arrest, his
Â¦'brother visited the office of Captain of
Detectives Seymour and asked him _to
lend his efforts in locating the love-smit
ten youth. As It was thought that young
Lowry might be with his "bride in her
room on Turk street Detective Anthony
was sent there to ascertain and inciden
tally to have an interview with Mrs.
Lowry As the detective entered the room
he was pleasantly greeted by the woman.
She informed him that her husband was
in Placer County and that she was about
! to join him. Her trunk was already
I packed, and as it was nearlng train timÂ«
I she was anxious to start for the ferry.
i Anthonv insisted that she accompany
J him to" Captain Seymour's olHce. which
I she did under protest. By the time she
I reached the City Hall tho train which
she intended to take pulled out, compell
ing her to wait until to-day before join
ins: her husband.
"This is an outrage." she remarked to
Captain Seymour. "Here I have been de
layed from meeting my dear little hubby
by his relatives, who are trying to make
trouble for me. I am no spring chicken,
and they will find it out before they get
through with me."
The brother of Lowry wanted Captain
Seymour to arrest the woman for vag
rajicy, but this he declined to do. Mrs.
Lowry says, she will start for Placer
County to-day, despite the threats of the
Lowrys to detain her.
The bride lias been singing In local con
cert halls and has just completed an en
gagement at the Oberon.

FATHER YORKE'S CRITICISM
ON THE UNIVERSITIES
Â¦*
THE presidents of the two great educational Institutions, tho University of
California and the Inland Stanford Jr. University. have declared that
the pupils of our schools should be tausrht only by graduates from
theli* universities. Why should in Is be so? The schools were built for the
pupil and riot for the teacher. The San Francisco School Board baa suggested
a new system by which it claims only the truly pood may be realized, and
in order that their scheme may be carried out pet Presidents Jordan and
Wheeler to prepare plans by which th<Â» teachers of the future are to be chosen.
It Is high time for the public schools to so out of business when they put a
monopoly upon education and the sole suppliers of the teachers in this State
are the two great universities.
The president of Berkeley is a clergyman. Suppose a priest was appointed
to any position In the university, a howl would go up that would shake your
heels. There is only one way. and that Is for Catholics to have their own
schools and colleges. President Jordan of Stanford says: "Give a ten-dollar
boy a hundred-dollar education and it won't make him a better man." Give a
ten-cent professor a J1COO salary and It will not make him worth a bit more.
President David Starr Jordan tells us how the education of the future
must be from the great colleges and not from the small colleges. He would
make the great private college at Palo Alto the same Institution In education
as the Standard Oil Company is in business. Some of our learned public edu
cators are of tne opinion that the principal danger of civilization Is from the
interference of the politician in the public schools. The cry of "Take the
public schools out of the hands of the politicians" Is dishonest." It simply
means "Take it away from this element and bestow it upon those who favor
U3."Production of the College Farce Concludes the

dentally Mayfleld life Is seen. The plot
ehows two elderly college professors who
have taken a notion to visit Patagonia
on a voyage of exploration and original
research. -The wife of one of the profes
sors, who does not want her husband to
make the trip and who does all in her
power to prevent It, succeeds in ridicu
lously complicating matters. Then follows
a series of petty larcenies, misrepresenta

victims from the meshes of the law that
the author's greatest tact Is displayed and
the most exciting scenes originated. After
a merry time In a place near Mayfleld,
which a scheming student represents as
Patagonia, the professors cast off the in

CHAMPIONS SHUT OUT.
Rice's famous historical extravaganza.
'â¢14P2, or the Discovery of America," iTrew
e large audience at both performances
yesterday and proved by far the greatest
success of the t-reason. It was elaborately
mounted and costumed and a new march
cf pretty girls, arranged by Charles H.
Jones, pleased the audiences and had to
be repeated. The ca.st proved an excel
lent one. Edwa.nl B. Adams- as Queen
Isabella scored a hit and completely oh
fcured the memory of Harlowe in that
r^rt. Oforge I^ydlnjr was admirably made
i:p as Columbus and was loudly encored
for hip vpkndH rendition of Mascajrnl's
"Ave Maria." He and IxjuIsp Royce. who
appeared op the Infanta, were very suc
rr.^ful in a pretty duet in the first act.
lsaboll<Â» t~nderw<>c,d's contralto voice wa.Â«
heard to good atlvantage in a charming
Konp. "The Vivandiere." Arthur Woolcy
convulsed the audience as a boy of 4
j-fars of a*re and an Irish policeman.
Harry C. Ca.'hman was an amusing fÂ«Â»at
ixrf of the programme as thÂ«Â» King of
Fpain and a tramp. Douplas Flint had a
conponlal roV as the royal treasurer and
Ethel Straehan cleverly portrayed a
Tiewsho?. "ll'.C" Fhouid draw crowded
houses the whole week, for it affords a
delightful entertainment and is a happy
combination of pretty women, pretty
mu?ic. 'handsome costumes, picturesque
Bcenery. clever comedians and merry
jests.
RICE'S 1432 MAKES
HIT AT THE GRAND
When tbe game closed the faculty had
11 runs to their credit, while the seniors
had tallied but 10. Following is tho way
the teams lined up:
Faculty. Position. Seniors.
Richardson ..'..,... .Catcher LanaKan

To-night the senior farce was given in
the Assembly Hall beiore a large au
dience. The play, entitled "To Have and
to Hold," 13 the work of John S. Briscoe,
ex-'OO, and is a very clever production
dealing with college affairs. The scene Is
j laid about the Stanford campus and lncl-
As it was, sensational plays were of or^
dlnary occurrence, Ncwsom at short and
Jordan at first developing the most re
markable team work Â«een on the field.
In justice to the class team it must be
said that they were somewhat handi
capped by an agreement with the faculty
players whereby Varsity men were not
allowed to play in their regular positions
in the Infield. For this reason Lanagan,
for two years pitcher on the cardinal
nine, was put behind the bat. while
Strohn, captain and second baseman, was
forced out into the field, where he could
do them little damage.
At half-past 10 o'clock this morning, the
scheduled time for the faculty-senior
baseball game, a large crowd was gath
ered on the diamond, curious to catch a
glimpse of the odd costumes which the
seniors were expected to wear. When the
baccalaureates appeared dressed as old
men of a decidedly agricultural type the
merriment was intense. So complete was
the disguise that even the players' best
friends were unable to distinguish them.
The game was close and interesting
throughout. President Jordan appeared
in his baseball uniform and held down the
Initial bag to the distinction of himself
and his team. Everything that came his
way was his. unless the ba.ee runner hap
pened to bump in to the reverend doctor
and jostle the sphere from his hands. Af
ter the first inning tho faculty had the
long end of the score anx^held it through
out the contest. Fish and Richardson,
both Varsity men when in dollege. were
the battery for the professors, and did
much to keep down their opponents'
scored runs.
STANFORD .UNIVERSITY, May 26.-
The second day of the commence
ment' festivities . was successfully
carried out'; before an Increased
number of visitors. Parents, eisters,
cousins and sweethearts of the members
of the graduating class have flocked into
Palo Alto until every hotel and residence
is filled to overflowing. These, together
with the large number of students who
have remained to witness the graduation
of the class of 1900, comprise the largest
and gayest crowd that have ever attended
a Stanford commencement.
Special- Dispatch to The Call.
Snapshots at the Stanford Baseball Game.
ber of players from the university nine
and clever enough substitute ball-toshers
to fill in bowed its collective head and bit
the dust of defeat before an august aggre
gation headed by Dr. Jordan. It was
awful â not the ball playing but the blow
to the seniors.
For four long years they have nursed
the pain of faculty intervention in many
affairs of student life as semester after
semester passed by, only to be turned
down at the sundown of college days by
a miserly hand of fate that refused to
turn up a single ace-spot of a run in the
culminating inning of the game yester
day.
In this traditional contest at Stanford
it is customary for the seniors to defeat
their superiors in intellectuality by a
score ranging anywhere from 42 or 82 to
a couple or nothing.
The seniors looked as if they felt tired
when the umpire shouted play, and a
thousand chattering co-eds on the side
lines dropped suddenly into an expectant
Bllence, ready to observe a pride of the
university knock the cover off the
spheroid, punch -a big Mauser bullethole
through Professor-Pitcher Fish or smash
a window or two in Encina "Gym."
But he didn't; It was nothing but a lit
tle single, and Instead of a display of
pyrotechnics in the first inning calcu
lated i to raise that side-stepping Fourth
of July feeling forty flays ahead of time,
the scorer's bell only sounded once. That
was when "Chet" Murphy, the versatile
athlete of football fame, tore off that
opening hit and pilfered third a moment
later. On the next move he plunked a
hole in the home plate for that lonely
tally. Â» *
The faculty stand had been great, the
stellar performance of President Jordan
at first causing open-mouthed wonder, and
the lithe, quick work of the twirllne
"Prof not so much the merriment of
other years as a bit of hidden respect.
Then the "Profs" went to bat, threw
zoology, mathematics, chemistry, botany
ichthyology, mechanics and a few other
"ologles" to the four winds and sailed
right in on the curves of the senior pitch
er. "Prof." Kellog bunted like Keeler of
Brooklyn. Wing worked his base by tak
ing a fast one in the ear with notable
stoicism. Richardson was out of it on ac
count of misconnections. Heath dumped
an easy one at a bearded senior infielder,
who had evidently seen the wee hours,
and so juggled the ball, and the bases
were full.
Dr. Jordan then came to the bat. Now
you can run through nine years of Fac
ulty-Senior game records and you will find
that the president has his off years and
his "on" years, as a hitter. In '99 he swept
the atmospherfe with graceful motion each
time he attempted to connect. Anyway
the Â¦ curves of Pitcher Braden came up
easy, and it was pickin' cherries for the
doctor. -There were fireworks to burn and
runs over the rubber slab in the twink
ling of an eye. Then the debris was
cleared away, an inventory taken and it
wan found and entered among the hiero
glyphics of the score book - that the faculty
was two runs to the good in the ice box.
But fate took its inning again, and while
the senior tallies ran to five, and then to
ten, the faculty notched up eleven, and
i there it stood until tho end.

I'nole Hank's outfit of erratics sustained
their reputation yesterday afternoon on
the Kecreaiion prour.ris by the commission
of a plethoric number of errors and stick
work that was rot worth half of 30 cents.
With whirlwinds of dust and now and
then a sensational play tho game was any
thing hut Ihf torrid, exciting kind that
warms tlie heart of the fanatics.
Few hits and local errors tell the tale.

the same, ri'i'ly nnd Schwartz made an
Infield about eecosd base that was like a
nleve. Uncla'sT'chcree in placing the Im
ported catcher at short was a dire failure.
Until Ihe third Inning the game pro
gressed without run-making. With two
men relegated to the benches the Siough
City team sent Whalc-n over the rubber.
By. a failure toÂ»exercise a few of his stiff
jo"intK Rube Levy allowed the Stockton
pitcher to be credited with a three-baÂ«ger.
1'aee. p.Â«-xt at tbe bat. swatted a hot one
to Schwartz, i.nd a Juggle was instru

In the sixth Frisco began it? regular er

Harpers safe bunt. Then Morrow flew to
liroekhoff. who made a sensatior.a! one

scored Harper, and still another was re-

MERCY MAY IS
BEATEN OUT BY
A SHORT ENDER
Contrary to expectations, the sapling
stake â for greyhounds under one year ot
age â resulted in some good coursing yes
terday at Union Park. Of the twenty-five
entered only one had ever been started.
Despite their lack of experience Slipper
James Grace sent them off cleverly, not
one dog being unsighted and there being
no undecided courses. The first twenty
courses were run off in one hour, tile va
rious field oflicials keeping the handlers
on the jump from the start. The last two
courses lasted over two minutes. P. C.
Blick and Strand & Ettenberger, owners
of the winners, were granted permission
to withdraw them. The deciding course
of the stake is thus between Judge P. J.
Reilly's Early Dawn and George Watson's
FI Fi. Karly Dawn Is apparently the best
in tho stake: and is of great promise. Yel
low Tail, which was withdrawn. Is pro
nounced by Judge Graee one of the best
young greyhounds he ever rode behind.
May Lawrence, of the same litter, is also
a clever performer and haa more than the
average share of good looks. Icicle, an
Australian greyhound, was the only bad
actor, refusing to follow the hare.
There were a number of surprises in the
open stake, and where upsets came the
betting was usually 5 to 1. Golden Garter
defeated Commodore at these odds. King's
Borderer defeated the recent importation.
Golden Nugget, at the same price easily,
the climate having laid its grip on the
latter. Overture beat Candelarfa, Reck
less Archer beat llonor Bright after an
undecided course, Shootover beat Forest
Queen and Hot Foot beat St. Anthony,
all at odds of 5 to 1. Silver Wings beat
Rude Awakening at 2 to 1.
The bettors look for Hot Ha3te and Vul
can to fun far into the stake to-day.
Metallic, Rocker. For Glory, Little Sister,
Luntlin Links, Risky Attempt and Cava
lier are also expected to show well.
Luxor is favorite in the champion stake,
although he was defeated the last time
out by Palo Alto. The latter is the* choice
after Luxor, with Ireland, his kennel
mate, also favored. The results of the
running yesterday, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:

CERTIFICATES AWARDED
FOR GOOD SCHOLARSHIP
The deed establishing the trust and pro
viding for Mary Webster Merritt and her
children was recorded only after all the
others had been placed on record. ThÂ»
transaction was a. complicated one and
the five documents were necessary to
straighten out the tangle that involved
the valuable estate of the late Dr. Mer
ritt.
After having secured by deed an Inter
est In the Madison and Oak streets blocks
Fred Merritt transferred a one-half Inter
est in this property to his wife, Lucy
Brown Merritt.
In all five deeds were filed to clear the
title to the property involved. The first
was from Mary Webster Merritt to James
P. Merritt. conveying the property sued
for. So that James P. Merritt might have
sole ownership of the Market-street prop
erty Fred A. Merritt made over his half
interest in that land to his brother, re
ceiving In return from James one-half
Interest In a portion of the Madison and
Oak streets property.
The trustees are to receive all rents and
profits of the buildings on the property
and are to receive as compensation for
their services 6Vi per cent of all such
issue. Should one of them die or resign
his successor shall be appointed by the sur
vivor, acting in conjunction with Mrs.
Merritt and a Judge of the Superior Court.
Mrs. Merritt is appointed trustee for the
children. Should she marry or die the
property goes to them. When the chil
dren have reached their majority they
are to become sole owners of the property
and are to hold it for their heirs.
The property deeded by Mrs. Mary Web
ster Merritt to James P. Merritt consists
of the block at Market and Seventh
streets, land at Fourteenth and Madison
streets. Thirteenth and Oak streets and
water front lots at North Beach. San
Francisco. All of this realty was prayed
for by Merritt in the partition suit Insti
tuted by him against his wife and dis
missed several days before she commenced
action for a divorce.
James P. Merritt sets forth in a deed
transferring Market-street property to his
wife and children that he took such action
for the purpose of making adequate pro
vision for their maintenance as long as
they should live. He names George W.
Reed and Emll Nusbaumer as trustees
to take charge of the property and to
see that the provisions of the deed are
carried out.
The dispute of the members of the Mer
rltt family over the possession of valuable
property has been settled. Deeds were
filed to-day by which James P. Merritt
is made the owner of the property prayed
for in his suit against his ex-wife and
Mrs. Mary Webster Merritt Is transferred

OAKLAND. May 28.â A handsome business block will be erected at once for
the'De Fremery estate at a cost of about JSO.OCO. It will stand en the west
side of Washington street, between Twelfth and Thirteenth, having a front
age of So feet and a depth of 100 feet. The front will be of stone and the re
mainder of brick. The lower floor will be used for one large store and the other
floors will be arranged for offices. It will be a first class modern structure
throughout. The architect is G. W. Percy and the drawing Is by Willis Polk.
For the defense J. C. Kennedy testified
as to the manner in which Mrs. Donnelly-
Hilborn remitted the $21 she had collected
to Mme. Harbldge-Marlstany. Several
witnesses testified to the good character
of the defendant. The taking of evidence
will be conclude Monday.
Mrs. Donnelly-Hllborn's trial on a
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement
proceeded all day before Justice Morris.
The job lot <">f testimony offered by both
the prosecution and defense consisted
of criminations and recriminations.
Joseph Maristaay. Mme. Harbldge-Maris
tany's agod husband, told a confusing
story and aroused the Ire of the defense*
by his premature answers to questions.
He was asked if his wife played thÂ»
horse races, the Intention of the defense
being to show that she had lost money
in betting and was trying to cover up the
losses with accusations of embezzlement
against her former employes.
The testimony of Mme. Harbidge-Mar
lstany was the story of her life. She had
been married four times. At 22 she be

HIGH SCHOOL CLASS
â¢OF '85 HAS A REUNION
CAPTAIN F. A. HART.
CAPTAIN F. A. HART of the United
States transport service passed
away yesterday at the military hos
pital at the Presidio after a pro
longed Illness. He had a wide circle of
acquaintances and he was well liked by
all who knew him. He had a reputation
of being one of the most efficient com
manders in the transport service.
Captain Hart has been. sailing between
this port and the Orient for a score of
years. He was an employe of the Oceanic
Steamship Company. At one time he was
second officer on the Matiposa, and before
he left the company he had risen to the
position of chief officer of that vessel.
" Captain Hart's death was Indirectly due
to injuries he received while in temporary
charge of the Mariposa, four years ago.
The vessel was en route to Sydney. N. S.
W. A heavy sea was running, and when
Mr. Hart was relieved from duty on the
bridge he proceeded to descend to the
deck, when a heavy sea broke over the
vessel and threw him with great force
against the bulwarks. Three of his ribs
were broken and he suffe-ed other in
juries.
When the ship arrived at its destination
Hart was pent to the hospital for treat
ment. He was unable to rejoin his ship
when it departed on its return voyage.
While in the hospital at Sydney he was
visited each day by a lady, who brought
him delicacies and helped nurse him back
to good health. A mutual feeling of af
fection sprung up between patient and
nurse, and when ne recovered they were
united in marriage. He brought his bride
to this city and they took up residence at
tho California Hotel. T
When the war with Spain broke out
Captain Hart was chief officer on the
Mariposa. The Government, appreciating
his worth as a seaman, tendered him the
command of the transport Scandia, and
he piloted that vessel to Manila. On hia
return from the Philippines he was again
taken sick, but managed to accompany
the W T arren on its trips to and from the
islands. He was taken sick a few months
ago. and despite his weakened condition
he Journeyed to Mare Island and brought
his transport off the drydock. He re
mained on the bridge tfurlng the trip -of
the ship to this port, and as a result he
was made dangerously ill. He was re
moved to St. Luke's Hospital and it was
found necessary to perform an operation
on him. Captain Hart grew rapidly worse
and he was removed to the military hos
pital, where he passed away yesterday.

WILL ASK FOR BIDS
TO BUILD LIBRARY
The surety company denies that it Is re
sponsible to the city of Oakland for the
sum alleged to have been retained by the
ex-Auditor, or for any sum whatever. It
is denied .that the corporation has any
knowledge that Roland W. Snow ever col
lected the money In question or whether
he was ever Auditor and ex-offlcio As
sessor of the city of Oakland.
It is admitted that Mayor Snow executed
a bond in March. 1597. but it is alleged
that he took the paper away the same day
that It was signed, and since that time It
has not been seen by an agent of the
surety company. ThÂ« point is thus raised
that the company has no knowledge of the
existence of a bond given by It for R. W.
Snow In favor of the city.
For further defense the defendant cor
poration alleges that if there was any sum
of money received by Snow and withheld.
It was with the consent of the plaintiff
municipality as a compensation allowed
for the collection of taxes.
OAKLAND. May 2S.-As a result of the
action of the City Council several days

employes who have given as surety the

Oakland against Roland W. Snow for the

SOjME /\JMTIQUES
OAKLAND. May Mâ The monthly meet
ing of the ceramic section of the Ebell
Club, which took place this afternoon, was
unusually interesting by reason of a beau
tiful display of rare and antique pottery.
Perhaps the most odd collection was that
of Russian and Polish copperware, loaned
by Mrs. Armiston Swayze. The different
articles had been over 400 years in a
Polish family, from whom they were pur
chased by Dr. Swayze. Mrs. Norton's col
lection of pitchers attracted a great deal
ol attention, as did also tee rare_asaort
ment of brass candlesticks loaned by Mrs.
William Clilt. * .... .
The center of interest in the exhibit of
colonial pewter by Mrs. R. M. Lyman was
a candlestick once owned by Major Gen
eral Greene. Two small gods, one of
Pain, the other of Plenty, stood guard
over a line display of Mexican and Indian
blankets and ware owned by Mrs. George
C Parciee. Mrs. Harry P. Oarleton, Mrs.
Friend and Mrs. George \V. Percy had in
charge the miscellaneous collection of
wedgewood, rookwood and various other
kinds of pottery, many pieces of which
were gems of art and antiquity. Mrs.
Bulkley, president of the Kbell Club,
loaned a couple of wedgewood fruit dishes
that had belonged to her grandmother,
and were over 1U0 years old. One dainty
little article in the collection was particu
larly interesting from the fact that it was
home production. It was a tiny pitcher
of composition ware and as light as an
eggshell It is the only thing of the kind
in California, and was made by Mrs. Kob
erts-on of San Francisco. 'Â¦
For the library there was a wonderful
collection of embroideries, which had been
loaned by Miss Mary Abeel Williamson,
who won several medals at the World's
Fair Throngs of admirers surrounded
the exquisite work all afternoon, the
tablecloths, in Persian effect, but the ex
ecution and design of which were Miss
Williamson's own invention, being most
particularly praised.
The afternoon closed with a musical pro
gramme, during which tea was served by
tho ladies of the ceramic section. Mrs.
Lvman, the curator, was hostess. Miss
Kdith Ward sang two numbers The sec
ond movement of Haydn's First Trio was
very effectively rendered by Mrs John
Lewis, violfn; Ray Burrell; ce lo, and
Miss K Kelly, piano. Other ladies who
exhibited rare china were Mrs. B. C.

The Consul has interested himself in the
son of the illustrious poet and will see
that he is accorded every courtesy on his
way back to Kneland for arraignment on
the charges pending against him. While
refusing to admit more than the bare
fact of his relationship to the author of
"The Light of Asia," the prisoner is ter
ribly wrought up because the knowledge
has become public. He wept bitterly and
sank to the floor of his room, his emotion
being the strongest evidence that he felt
most keenly his position. That he had
failed in his efforts to bury his identity
preyed apparently more upon his hiehlv
tensioned nerves than did the prospect be
fore him of confronting the law In the
cold, hard courts of his native country
Away in Japan the knighted parent

The usual extradition proceedings have
been waived, and all that the United

notice from Washington to send Arnold
back to England.
"My father is Sir Edwin Arnold," he
said this evening. "That is as far as I
will go with my family history. It makes
no difference to the public who I am, and
it is none of ltB business whether I have

WASTED TO COOL

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

The explosion of a vulcanizer this after
noon wrecked the dental laboratory of Dr.
J. Loran Pease, in the Central Bank block,
destroying several hundred dollars' worth
of work and playing havoc v.lth a lot of
valuable apparatus. Dr. Baldwin, a den
tist, who had been assisting Dr. Pease,
had left the apartment only a few seconds
before the explosion occurred.
The force of the explosion was sufficient
to hurl a heavy castiron cover through
the celling and to drive a thick copper
vessel through a two-inch plank. Heavy
boards forming the workbench were spiin
tered, and a piece of steel rai! two feet
long was tosaed a dozen feet like a
feather.
The supposed cause of the explosion was
the overheating of the large copper tank
In which rubber plaU-p for false teeth are
vulcanized or hardened under steam pres
sure. The tank is built for. eighty to a
hundred pounds' pressure to the square
Inch. Dr. Baldwin estimates that it must
jiave sustained double that force before It
burst.
A short time before the wreck the copper
vessel, which Is three-quarters of an Inch
thick, was prepared for service, and two
large trays of plat<>s were set ip it. The
tank was heated by gas burners beneath
It, and on the top of it was a heavy cast
lron cover fastened with a screw. There
was no warning of the accident.
The sudden crash startled Dr. Pease,
who was in his operating room, adjoining
the laboratory. Rushing into the other
room he quickly discovered the cause of
the trouble. His first move was to shut
off the escaping gas. In looking for the
remains of tho tank the cover was found
imbedded in the floor joists above, with a
lot of the ripped copper svewn among the
flooring under the laboratory.
The explosion was violent enough to Jar
the big brick building with all the effect
of an earthquake shock.

to an appreciable extent last week dpspite the
heavy Influx* of interior fund* to this center.
The gains In cash were made for the most part
ty several large institutions, whose special
cperations also account for changes in other
leading Items. Thus the Increases In the
loans and deposits of one bank alone were
fully as large as the total advances made by
all the banks. Viewed In a. broad light, how
ever, the statement must be regarded as favor
able. Money is being received In New York
from ell Interior points and . the sain made
last week was double the average for any
similar period thla month. How Ions this
Inflow of currency Is to continue cannot be
decided pff hand, but the effect is witnessed
in an easy market, offerings of. time funds
being made with great liberality over the rest
of the year. Tbe demand does not indicate any
great pressure for accommodation. Both loans

previous period this year and the cash reserve

CHICAGO, May 26.â The wheat market was
almost too small to be visible to the naked eye.
The market opened firm because the Northwest
was Etlll without sufficient moisture to sprout
the seed. Later, principally out of Bheer In
activity, the market eased and the half-session
wound up In an Inanimate condition. The pit
was all but deserted most of the day. Cables
were easy. July closed a shade under yester
day at 67c.
Corn was weak at the start. It grew weaker
as the session progressed and at the end was
at its weakest. This was because of Increased
farmers" deliveries and the favorable weather
combined with a slack demand. There Teas only
a very lonÂ«ly Bcattering bunch of traders. July
closed *Â»@Hc under yesterday at 36~Â».
With corn and wheat dull, little could be ex
pected of oats. The speculative trade was flat.
July closed ?i'gVio down at 21ViÂ«(21*ic.
Provisions dragged throughout the session
and toward the close became decidedly weak.
A weaker hog market, the dullness and the
grain weakness were the factors. July pork
closed 12^c under yesterday, lard 10c lower and
rlbfÂ» 7%c depressed.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
