cause she was too poor to live respectably
in a large ciiy or among fashionable peo

poor,. it is not true* that she* was financial

at that -time at least $14,000 to her. credit

from titled gentlemen In Europe begging
her to comeJthere-and live off their, rich

. At about that time Lola Montez met in

The young woman accepted, and, strange
to say. she fell in love with the rude wild
town at once. There were but few well

a dozen of them had more than three
rooms each. Most of the houses and
stores were built of rough redwood
boards. There were over 2500 red-shirted
men In town and about 200 women. There
pever was a more democratic community.

Ev^ry'one' admitted that she was a most

berorre the brilliant conversationalist she
was. but the public looked upon her as an
adventuress, who cared only to harvest

champions of the woman was a youliff
Irish editor. Pat Hull of San Francisco.
UÂ« and Lola became best friends. She
eaid Pat was the best story-teller she ever
know. Pat. had been a stump speaker in
Ohio and Pennsylvania in the campaign
cf IMS and President Taylor appointed him
to come to the Territory of California and
supervise the census of 1SS0. Pat liked the
country and became an editor in -â¬an
Francisco. He had the proverbial Irish
wit and his audacity pleased Lola Montez.
He was not at all good-looking and was
Â¦T-louchy in h!s dress. Â£o when it was an

Lola had married there was a sensation
In the city. Pat and Lola went to Mon

A fact not generally known among thÂ«

At that time San Francisco was a city of
ab.out 20.000 people, and it was the grayest,
liveliest and most extravagant city of its
size In the world. Lola Monte* had heard
of the golden dollars in the new El Do

OF LOLA MONTEZsons is much smaller, than Is generally
supposed, there being only about fifty in
the entire United States. â The education
of these is of course extremely, difficult
and it Is not often that they are put'com

world. There are of course Â¦ some excepÂ«

has gone on with its work of fitting the
State's unfortunates for the struggle for
life in the classical shades of the college

Ar.d In this work it has succeeded to a
wonderful degree. The list of those who
entered Us portals helpless and cut off
from communication with their fellow
men. and who went forth independent, to
â¢win not only livelihood but honor and
fortune, includes names well lyiown in

tion, "the ability to' read does not depend
upon any especial delicacy in the, texture
of the skin or on any abnormal nerve'eeri
ters in the fingers; .'Â¦ We feel Just. what you
feel, but we know how to interpret it bet

Then she sÂ«t down to. a piano and sang.
It was a simple little ballad, yet; at 'the
sound of her rich, sympathetic -soprano
the". listener "could not: help butrecognlze
that the singer is an artist at soul and
that the praises that have been showered
bo generously upon: her. were tributes, not
to her blindness but to her genius. But
for her blindness who knows to what
heigh/s she may not attain. And ' who
knows to what heights she may not at
tain In spite of it?
And how does this institution for the
training of the deaf and dumb and blind
do Its'. work?
Its first and principal equipment is an
infinite patience on the part of the
teachers. From all parts of the State
come boys and girls between the ages of
7 or 12, deprived of one. or more senses.
Then the first task is to establish some.
mode of communication between the pupil
and the outside world. In the case of
those who are deprived only of sight this
Is a comparatively easy task. They ; can
hear and use spoken â¢ words And -their
mode of thought is the same as that of
others. Their education; . then, consists
ot an acquirement of tho knack of read-
Ing raised letters. This once- mastered
they have at their disposal a library of
about 1000 volumes, including , all tha
standard works. By this means they are
given a course in general culture, and If
they show any disposition for it, in music.
The .blind pupil graduating from the in
stitution at 20 has a. knowledge of alge
bra, geometry, geography, history, gram
mar, literature, languages and all the
otner branches that go to make up a gear
eral education.
In the case of the deaf-mute it la far
different. Ho . has , no '\ comprehension of
language until by slow and laborious pro
cesses it is Imparted to him. This Is in
variably a matter of no small difficulty.
"I know of nothing harder," said Super
intendent Wilkinson, ."than to teach a
mind accustomed entirely to a sign lan
guage, and having no comprehension of
abstract ideas apart from things,' to think
In terms of words Instead of in: terms of
concrete objects. -Itis'always hardest at
tho beginning. The pupil comes here often
with no conception of language, w'ith a
mental Hfo mude up : entirely of sight
Images. means of pictures and objects
we gradually teach them the use of print
ed substantives. Then by taking these
name-words to pieces we get at the alpha
bet. This is the most difficult part of the
process and often takes many yÂ«ars. Af
ter the alphabet is mastered we teach
them word formation and their education
becomes vastly simplified after they learn
to understand printed -language. -
"Imagine trying to Inculcate an ab
stract, idea of morality or: the existence
of-a'God Into a mipd which depends en
tirely upon sense perception for ideas. - .' It
is almost impossible. The primitive sign

the deaf are at first much

With .the deaf and dumb life Is a far

point where they can understand lan

par with the outside world. The girls
study, sew, embroider, and In their play

[Track athletics has always been the
weakest Jlraneh of sport at Stanford, al-~
though there have been some good indi
viduals. Charles Dole, nephew of the
President of Hawaii, was probably the
best all-round man on the ccist. he hav
ing taken third place In a national con
test. He ha3 scored as many a3 fifteen
points in an intercollegiate field day. The ;
Doles at Stanford are like the Woolseys
at Berkeleyâ there has been one there,
brother or sister, ever since the college
was opened, and all the men were ath
letes. It runs in the family, two of the
older, brothers having been Cornell foot
ball and rowing men. Dole the- second Is
known as "Guiby" Dole, owing to his feat
of holding dewn Gulberson. a Berkeley
player who outweighed him by seventy
pounds, in a freshman football game.

"Our Presidents and /" rjoW We
Mak.e Tbem."
In this year of the Presidential election
a book that will excite universal atten
tion Is "Our Presidents and How We
Make Them," by A. K. McClure, LL. D.
Colonel McClute is a man most ably qual
ified to write upon such a subject and he
certainly has made a success in his at
tempt. He has been in touch with every
national convention for the past fifty
years, and has. had a personal acquaint
ance .with nearly all the Presidential can
didates during that period: hence it .can
be readily understood why his book
should contain much new and interest
ing matter concerning the inside workings
of the various campaigns, political inci-
disconnected from the earlier tale. Guert
v is simply the hero of both stories, and his
experience as a privateer on the uncon
querable Noank promises to be full of ad
venture, fighting, action and the thrill of
victory. Mr. Stoddard knows well just
how to tell such a story and he can be
depended upon to put just the amount of
vjgor, life and "go" into this privateer
Â£tory that every boy likes and that he
yhas injected Into all his tales of adven
ture, dacjng and duty. The book Is
strongly illustrated by Will Crawford.
A letter from Julian Ralph, written at
Bloemfontein on March 24, stated that
Rudyard Kipling, Ralph himself and one
or two others were editing a paper there
for Lord Roberts.
Klplir.g has written a new poem on the
subject of the shamrock in the same me
ter as that of "The Wearing of the
Green." The opening lines are:
O, Terence, dear, and did ye hear
The news that'* going round?
The Shamrock's Erin's badge by law
Where'er her sons are found!
This poem has been copyrighted In the
United States of America In the name of
Mr. Ralph, who apparently has seen
much of Kipling in the latter's new"~role
of war correspondent.
.Julian Ralph has the happy faculty of
making warm friends wherever he goes.
.Robert Barr ran across the genial Amer
ican correspondent Just as the latter. In
company with a large number of British
officers, was about to leave London for

."The Campaign of the Jungle."
Since Oliver Optic's and Harry Castle

have written books as well calculated to
interest boys as those of Edward Strote

the purpose of causing them needless and
monotonous study.
Mr. Strotemeyer has written a series of

embodying the most important features
of the Spanish-American war and the re
bellion of the Filipinos, are sufficiently
interwoven with fiction to render them
most entertaining to young readers. "The

BOTH the Marstons, father and son,
of the London ' Fishing Gazette,

died recently. E. Marston. the father,
was born in the same year as
rilacUmore. 1S25, and knew him intimately
for half a century. R. B. Marston, the
son, says: "I well remember one even-
Ing, more than. thirty years ago. how my
father, the 'Amateur Angler,' brought
home a neat quarto manuscript,, written
in blue ink in a very small but wonder
fully clear hand. He told us that Its title
was 'Lorna Doone,' and that it was a
romance of Exmoor â a story about a band
of robbers; should he read it to us? There
were delighted cries of ''Yes. yes, do,' for
we knew by experience that If the "Ama
teur Angler" offered to read one of the
manuscripts he often brought home, it
would be something worth listening to.
Thus it was that for the first time one
English household listened night after
night- with breathless interest to the great
romance. Since then countless thousands
have also come under the spell of the
Wizard of the South, more than a million
copies having been sold in English-speak

tion was to send me, year after year, lo
fish in the wild Exmoor country In which
Its scenes are laid."
Of â¢ "Lorna Doone," Mr. Marston Sr.
said: "He always had, or seemed to
have, a sort of jealousy of 'Lorna Doone,'
and certainly did not regard It with as
much complacency as Its pre-eminent suc
cess would have led one to expect."
By a lucky catch, the way of which R.
B. Marston learned when a boy at school
playing football, he once saved Blackmore
from a serious if ' not a fatal accident.
"We had arranged," says Marston, "to
have some trout fishing together in the
Tillingbourne, and one fine May morning
in 1SSJ I started early from home for Tetl
dington, where I found my friend on the
platform ready to welcome me. \ We
walked through the grounds to his house,
and after some light refreshment, which
Mrs. Blackmore pressed upon us In her
ever kindly manner, we got our rods and
baskets stowed away in the high dogcart,
in which Mr. Blackmore was to drive me
to Shalford, near Guilford. It was a drive
of some, fifteen miles or more, through
lovely country, to which I had looked for
ward with great pleasure, and under more
auspicious circumstances, with one who
knew the country well and could talk
about it so delightfully, it would have
passed my. expectations.
"We got up into the high dogcart In a
lane, called Field lane, leading from the
house to the main road. Mr. BlackmÂ»ra
took the reins from the groom and we
started, but had not gone many yards be
fore I felt the dogcart .was turning over
on its Bide. ; Being young and active I
jumped Instantly, and, luckily, landed on
my feet and, turning quickly round. I saw
Mr. Blackmore coming down head first.
Bein^ but a yard away I sprang forward
and threw my arms round his back and
chest, and so broke his fall, for In another
second he would have fallen with all his
weight right onto his head on the road.
But he was. a big, broad-shouldered man,
and I could not prevent bending under his
weight, so that his head, which was under
me as I bent over clasping l hls back to my
chest, came to ground and his nose and
forehead were scratched rather severely
by the gravel.
"Luckily the horse stood still und the
groom rushed up and held it while we
picked ourselves up. Mr. Blackmore's face
was bleeding a good bit and of course I
wished him to return home,' but he would
not hear of it, saying that he would not
on any account do so, as It would upset
his wife. He assured me he felt all right
and explained that in consequence, as he
believed, of the groom having given him
the reins crossed, he had driven the wheel
against a stout timber strut supporting
the high fence. So, with some misgivings
on my part (for I could see my friend was
both shaken and nervpus), we got the
croom to lead the horse out Into the main
rbad" and then, drove off. Mr. Blackmore
kept having to wipe the blood from his
face and when we had gone a few miles I
persuaded him: to stop at an Inn and have
a wash and a rest and some brandy. * Al
though suffering much more than he
would tell me, he most pluckily drove
right on to Shalford, where we arrived
without further mishap, and after lunch
we went fishing, or rather I fished and he
looked on." ;.",;.:* . <- Â¦ â¢ .
E. Marston in the course of a lifetime
hael many interesting' letters and notes
from Blackmore. Says Mr. Marston:
"Writing to me once about a bitter dis
appointment as to the market for hid
fruit, he added, but 'weeping will not
warm it,' as the old woman said of her
good man's corpse.
"Writing to me about the sixpenny edi
tion of 'Lorna Doone,' he said: 'It would
not surprise me much if you made a hit
with the sixpenny "L. D.," such is the
thickheadedness of the many headed.
?..*â¢ â¢ 'If the other . books, some of
which are of a higher order than "L. 1>.,"
could be made to go, I might defy the few
seasons' yet before me. Vainly do I lock
for pears; but to know why there are
none^is, or ought to be. a comfort.'
"In another of his more recent letters,
dated last July, writing about his fruit,
he says: 'The vile behavior of my treea. to
whom I have been very good- â¢ â¢ â¢ for
bids air good will or faith in fairness.
Three years now of grim nakedness drive
me into savage land, where the thorny
cactus standsâ for pears! By the ironies
of fate we have a glorious time for fruit,
and none to know It or to feel it.'
"Often would he humorously bewail the
ups and downs of a gardener's life. Ke
liked to tell how the inclement weithcri
nipped his buds or destroyed hi3 fruI'-V
when his fruit was abundant the market"*
for it was nil, cr when he had no fruu u'e/
market was good and prices wore hlgh^
But never, in the midst of all his suffer-/
ing. was there any note of complaint onV
that ground except by way of a joke so"*
that from himself or his letters one would/
hardly realize the terrible pain he was un-i
dergoing. I eiuote a characteristic bit^
from one of his little notes written mc-^C
than two years ago: 'If a fellow can be->

The doctor said to me on Monday: "If i">

"If I could but for a few minutes in-/

spark of his bright humor I should Mke;
to paint a little picture of him as I om-eC

Professor E. P. Gould has the following
discussion, which will be of Interest to
clergymen If not to the general theologi

of righteousness? The answer to this is
obvious to any one who is conversant with,
the apostle's thought. At least, the most
obvious answer is that faith Justifies be
cause It connects the nan with Christ.
Our Lord is himself the vital principle of
the new life, and faith is what brings the
source and the recipient of the life to
gether, as roots bring the plant and the
soil together. Anything in either God or
Christ which Is restoring and life giving
In Its effect may become the object of
faith and the restorer of life, but as a
?eneral thing. Just as It is Christ who Is
the usual object of faith, so it is the death
of Christ rather than the other aspects
of his life; and so we have here the first
attempt to rationalize the death of our
Lord." This last sentence Is illustrative
Of a very important element in Professor
Gould's treatment, namely, the tracing of
the gradual rise of theology through the
New Testament literature. In his treat
ment Professor Gould traverses some tra
ditional beliefs. In a way that is likely to
arouse some discussion.
Honolulu has a public library which hÂ«C
but Just turned of age, having been estab
lished April 6. 1S79. It was made the sub
ject of an appropriation of J1S0O one year
after Its founding, but this was never re
peated. It has never been asked to pay
taxes, however, and the Government has
given the water and electric light rates.
In return for which the children- of tha
public schools above to. certain grade have
the privilege of drawing books free of
charge. The library owns its own build

equipped with fiction of an excellent qual
ity, and the number of volumes of his

same, so that the balance between the
lighter and more serious branches Is pret
ty well kept. "As to the popular volumes
of the present day." says a writer In tha

Laird & Lee of Chicago have* just Issued
In a royal Svo. volume of 840 columns a
work that Is attracting great attention in
scientific circles in this country .and
abroad. It is entitled. "The Practice of
Palmistry, for Professional Purposes and
Scientific Students," and the author,
Comte C. de Saint-Germain of the Uni
versity of Paris, has achieved therein a
most e-xtraordinary feat of literary as
well as scientific labor. For the first time
the ancient art of hand-reading, which
has fascinated hundreds of generations
the world over, and whose star is still
bright as ever, is presented in the spirit
of modern investigation and with a sim
plicity and clearness that have been sadly
lacking in most of the smaller manuals
on the subject. The genius of systema
tization Is apparent in every detail of this
curious work, making it as interesting
reading as fiction and as easy to consult
as a dictionary. Every lelea of mystery
or occultism, every tendency to connect
palmistry with astrology or cabalistic
rites is resolutely condemned by the au
thor, who is satisfied to stand on a basis
of purely physiological researches and re
sults. No book of such magnitude, with
its 1254 original illustrations, its wealth of
cases taken from life and its dlctionary
of facts, readings and bibliography, has
ever been attempted In any language. It
surpasses Desbarrolles' immortal work In
precision and wealth of details, while giv-
BOOK REVIEWS
Â«M PRESS OCTAVIA, a Romance ol
, ' the Reign of Nero." while a book
j' ?thÂ«t will be read by many. Is never
theless one that will prove rather
disappointing. Us author is Wllhelra Wai
loth, a German, and his work has been
considered of sufficient value to warrant
a translation into English. This fact
alone would seem to guarantee the Btory
as one out of the ordinary and awaken
American Interest to find out if what has
doubtless been considered a success in a
foreign land will meet with approval when
offered in another tongue. Further, the
book will be read because It deals with the
time of Nero Just prior to the period
treated In "Quo Vadis." The sterling
qualities and great success of Slenkie
Â¦uicz's novel have by no means been for
gotten by the reading public, and any
book depending upon those days for its
theme will receive attention, if not for Us
ov.-ji or its author's sake, at least for the
fake of the Interest created In that ter
rible e;>och of the world's history by its
vivid portrayal In "Quo Vadis."
It is hardly fair to Sienklewicz to make
comparisons between his wonderful work
on the days of Nero and the present story
of Wiihelm Walloth. "Quo Vadis" is be
yond comparison. The present book,
"Empress Octavla," border? on mediocrity
end it is difficult to understand why It
Fhould have been deemed worthy the
trouble cf translation and publication. It
Is an unfortunate combination of fiction
&r.<i history â not enough story to properly
hold the reader's attention and interest
and not enough history to make It valu
cl !e as a text book.
In brief, the story is about a young
Fculptor. Metellus, who. ambitious for

who enjoys traveling the streets in dis
pose after dark with his attendants and
playing practical jokes on unoffending
ciiizens. Petronius. of "Quo Vadis" fame,
boing odp of the party, suggests to Nero
that he have the young man come to the
paJaoe ar.d make a bu?t of the Empress
Octavia; for the simple conversation of
MetcUua and his great personal beauty
have suggested to him that the young
man will prove a useful tool for Nero's
Fchemes. Nero has tired of his pure
minded wife, the Empress Octavla. but
fosrir.g to put her aside without cause on
account of the love for her in the hearts
of the people, by whom she is idolized, he
wishes to place her in some compromising
position that win make his act seem au
thorized and show himself In th# light of
a martyred husband. Metellus, at the
time, is not aware that he has struck the
dreaded Nero and promises to appear at
the palace the next day and present the
token given him by Petrcnius. Early the
next morning from a conversation over
hear*! in a barber shop he surmises the
truth, but being penniless and of a hope
ful turn of mind he assumes the risk and
keeps his appointment.
The scheme cf Petronlus meets with
partial success, for Octavia and Metal-
Jus fall in love with each other at first
Fight, although neither fully realizes the
extent of the malady. Friends of Octavia
warn her of the plot of Nero, and she
makes up her mind to see the young
Bcnlptor no more. Metellus himself is
also warned, but indi<mantly denies that
Nero could be guilty of such a vile plot,
and refuses to heed the words of advice
to leave Rome.
The plot docs not progress rapidly
enough to please Nero, so Petronius is
I forced to hurry matters, and, surround
ing Metellus' room with a band of sol
diers, lays the whole scheme before Him
and insists upon his carrying out his
j!.'irt under pain of death. Meteliua. who
up to this point has been represented as
the embodiment of frankness, sees that
he must resort to subterfuge In combat-
Ing this intrigue against his life and the
honor of the Empress, so he agrees to
carry out the plan, and imagines that be
cause he is left unguarded he Is also not
watched. In tho night he plans to go to
Octavia ar.d warn her of the danger and
then make his escape. He succeeds in
making his way to the bedchamber of
the- Empress, and tells her of the plot
which she had already feared. He inÂ«=iÂ«ts
up^ri kissing her good-by. and, of course
Nero, is In hiding to witness this fare
well and to obtain the cause for divorce
for which he had so long waited. Octavla
has her veins opened by the family phy-
Fician. and Metellus drowns while at
tempting to escape from some Roman
Centuriars.
The character cf Metellus is not a pleas-
Ing one. The simplicity of his nature
apparently finds Its source in weak mind-
JTu S L jud ~ ns? from inane arts of
which he is guilty; and his seeming purity
of thought appears to come from a lack
of knowledge of the worlds ways rather
than frcm any inherent quality of good
ness possessed by the- man himself. One
Incident of many which establish this fact
Is where the mistress of Nero. Poppaea,
who has fallen in love w!th Metellus. en

terfuge that he is there to meet Octavia
[and he finds himself in the arms of Pop- 1
psea before he realizes the deception. The
rc-one Is given a coloring of the "Venus

culrr.irationâ Mctelius falls an essy vic
tim. He is not a strong man rosistfng

through a lack of opportunity. The ar
tistic temperament and finer "sensibilities
cf which he is possessed keep him frcm
tnduigins In the common wickedness of
the corrupt court, but do not prevent him
from being absolutely selfish and culpa
bly weak when temrtation that appeals
to his nature presents itself.

"Bird Studies With a Camera."
Hunting birds with a camera instead of
a eun Is the way that Frank M. Chap
man shows what a true sportsman for
spprt's sake is, and gives at last proper
use "for a word which has been often mis
applied of late. Mr. Chapman hunted
all summer and his "game bag" is a book,
filled with the word and camera, pictures
which .amuse. Instruct and will not be
forgotten. There never yet was a game
bag filled by a gun that equaled this, yet
there was not a drop of blood spilled in
the filling.
The reader can feel, after reading the
ehort account of life in Chickadee Villa
that those same chickadees are still lead
ing their busy, earnest life and that their
little cares were not increase*! nor their
Joys diminished one whit by Mr. Chap
man's really sportsmanlike Incursion.
"Bird Studies" takes a new way of
looking at life. Where most writers find
but the desolate ocean, bleak cliffs and
the lonely call of the sea mew, Mr. Chap
man shows the ocean to be a bounteous
larder, stocked with toothsome, nourish
ing food, to be had for the taking by the
hungry birds. The bleak cliff is to him a
lively village or perhaps a great city
where thousands of feathered characters
lead intricate and highly enjoyable Iive3,
to which the reader is ' introduced. The
thousand birdland voices of the shore,
which are lumped Into "the lonely call
of the sea mew" by the unobservant
writer becomes interesting, lively chatter
when explained and reported by the cam
era sportsman.
Those things are seemingly outside. of
"camera studies," but the eye of the ob-.
server must first select what the camera
is to record, and it is the ability to see the
funny side of bird life and look at the
world frcm the birds' own point of view
that sives to the pictures their value. It
Is good, live sport, too, getting within
twelve-foot focal range of a bird, while
the man with a gun has an advantage In
being able to kill at ten times the dis
tance. "The camera thus opens the door"
to a field cf sport previously closed to
those v.-ho love birds too much to find
pleasure in killing them; to whom Bob
White's rinsing whistle does not give rise
to murderous speculations as to the num
ber of his family.*' That short bit gives
the tone of the book, and the reader, un
less particularly bloodthirsty, will perhaps
fall In line with its views.
The pictures cannot be fully appreciated
until one puts himself In the place of the
camera hunter and remembers that It
takes more than the cunning of an In
dian to get a bulky camera with Its click-
Ing noises close enough to give clear pic
tures.
Here are some of the Ingenious ways In,
which Mr. Chapman persuaded his poses
to "sit Ftill and look pleasant":
"With the reflecting camera one may
stalk birds on foot or with a boat, or
rqueak them Into range by kissing the
back of the hand vigorously â a sound
which during the nesting season especially
arouses much curiosity In the birds
mind."
Another method was to put up a stuffed
owl on a stick, near the home of a cat
bird preferably, erect a "scolding perch"
near it and then, after focusing the
camera on the perch, retire with a string
to control the shutter.
"A catbird's domain Is chosen for the
reason that this species is the alarmist
of whatever neighborhood it may inhabit,
and cr.ee Its attention has been attracted
to the owl by squeaking or uttering the
alarm notes of other- birds, the photo
grapher may subside and let the catbird
do the rest.
"The bird's rage is remarkable and its
fear painful. Should the owl be near the
catbird's nest. It will utter notes in a tone
r,f voice I have never heard it use on other
occasions. It loses all fear of the camera
and from the scolding perch screams at
the owl with a vehemence which threatens
to crack its throat..'*
Mr. Chapman's best photographs were
Fccurcd on the coast, of Nova Scotia,
where the birds ha% r e been left by a kindly
and hospitable people to enjoy the narrow
ledge of sea-sprayed rock and the right
to fish, which is all that a sea bird asks
cf the world. Â¦

There is talk these days of requiring
principals to teach in larger buildings
than Is now required. Perhaps there is
no stronger argument against this ln-
enrrafl. And aside frcm tne vainÂ© lit cats*
of real fire there Is an immense amount
of BcLf-control taught by the dxllL Ons
of our principals remembers the two boys
who were sent to his school basement to
investigate the cause of smoke and came
back to report that there had been a flrÂ»
there and they had put it out. If they
had never had all those lessons on emerg
ency and presence oZ mind, would they
not have been more likely to run back
shrieking' that the building was one fire?
Remember that the Lafayette School
burned to the ground and E00 children es
caped unhurt.
H SVSTEM THAT
cade that San Francisco has arrived at
the conclusion that her school buildings
were too inflammable and their stair.< too
steep for safety in case of fire. After
more or less struggle it was decreed that
a fire drill should be practiced in every
school in the city, and this drill takes
place at least twice a month. So If you
should wander In at some schoolhou?e
door on a lire-drill day you might see this
sort of thing.
Everybody Is busy In the usual way,
without the least sign of consciousness
that something is about to happen. This
is because they really do not know it â the.
lire alarm is given by the principal at any
time that may occur to licr, and she aims
to have that time always different. When
a real lire comes, it Is argued. It won't
post a bulletin of Its arrival in all tne
rooms.
So you will find Mollie Louise standing
to read "Across-the-lonely-beach-we-flitâ
Theâ littleâ sandpiperâ andâ I." You will
find Johnnie multiplying at the black
board and Jimmie beside him snipping
chalk when Miss Pedagogy is busy other
wheres. What noise there is in the room
Is the stillest kind of noise.
All at once the gong In the central hall.
THErtE Is a certain teacher in our
town who is being lionized a great
ii dÂ»Â»al lately on account of the part
she played in leading 5**} youngsters
out of a burning Fchoolhouse. She de
perves every bit of the credit she is get
ting, but don't you suppose she would
rather have it In a different form? In-
Ftead of crying that "Miss Casey was cool
enough to give th*Â» fire signal." or "Miss
Casey was discerning enough to smell
pmcke." why doesn't somebody sing Miss
Casey's prais* for all the weeks and
months and years that she has been drill-
Ing her school and herself to do what they
did automatically on that eventful Wed
nesday afternoon? The coolness, the
promptness, the presence of mind won all
the credit, but the greater part of it
rightly belonged to the perfected system.
It Is the came old story of the big occa
flon getting the praise that belongs to the
little day by day persistencies.
For more than half a dozen years the
fire drill has been compulsory In San
Franc'.sco's schools, and Mr. Kingsbury,
our" deputy Superintendent, pays that the
success in clearing the Lafayette School
Â¦was enough to pay for all those six or
more years of drilling and drubbing and
rub-a-dub-dubbing that all the schools in
Ban Francisco have been going through â
(or the sake of that one fire.
TIitp Is no State law making the drill
compulrory, but a local law exists now
In nearly every ciiy, and it has fought Its
â¢way in Szn Francisco pa*t protect and
argument, and it Ptill stands. The pros
are fat with pride now, and the cons
deem It advisable to refrain from over
many words until the excitement has died
down. Or. perhaps, the" will cease alto-
ECtlier from bcin.7 con? in the thought of
tho 5W little people who were brought out
tsfely from what. might have happened.

people In to school day after day, appears
to break loose. It clangs and clanks as
If Imps were tampering -with It, and what
It Ecrecms to the little children and the
big children Is "Fire." Not one pupil, or
teacher perhaps, in the whole building
knows whether thla means real fire of
merely a drill, but that makes no dlf? ,
ference. The building is to be emptied
in the shortcut time possible.
At the first sound of the alarm every :
child from top to bottom. of tne building
rises to face in the direction of exit, and
at , the teacher's immediate signal they
start to reach the yard. They move as
rapidly as is possible short of running,
and^yet the lines are. never broken; the
order of three abreast or four abreast, or
â¢whatever it may. be, Js <aa regular as at
any recess or end-of-school hour. Nobody
thinks of whispering; there is too much
hurry about getting outside. And when
it Is all over and several hundred chil-
It is claimed by the teachers who or
ganized this method that it 1Â» the natural

Almost all the schools have four exits,
so it is a. quick matter to pour a stream
of children into the street before they
can be injured by a fire. It must needs
be a rapid one that can get under dan
gerous headway before everybody is In a
place of safety.
There are' drills in which shifts are
made, so that If one exit be cut off the
line of march can be Instantly changed.
All this sounds simple and easy perhaps.
No one In the world but a teacher knows
anything of what it means to bring sev

they may be doing and go to the street

There have been "many objections raised
to the ' drill. Parents- have complained
that Jennie caught. co!d going outdoors
without her hat and that "Willie's studies
were Interrupted. Then, too, there Is the
danger, of- falling In -the hurried march

THE SUNDAY CALL.
5
FIRE DRILL in the SAN FRANCISCO
PUBLIC SCHOOL"Oh! Before you go, come and see CJaston asleep. Jfe is so
. pretty ."
Yes, but she did not care to see Mme.
Sanz under the present* circumstances,
and, to tell the truth, her repugnance was
mingled with a little fear. She was an
escaped prisoner, and it seemed to Lea
that they must be looking for her. It
was easy for her to say: "What do I
care? I am free to go where I like." But
the idea of ilnding herself again in the
presence of Frederique or of Pirnitz filled
her with terror. Had she not fled to es
cape from their moral tyranny?
"True. Mme. Sanz knows nothing of re
cent events as yet; but she will talk to
me about Frederique and the work. I
Fhould have to dissimulate or lie. Besides,
who knows? They may have telegraphed
to her already. Frederique and Romaine
will naturally appeal to Free College, as
they will divine that I am In London."
This thought was quite sufficient to de
cide her against the visit.
"I will only go there," she said to her
self, "as a last resource."
Suddenly a name recurred to her and
radiated like a cheerful lightâ "Edith!"
There was the step to take. It was both
easy and certain. Rejoin Edith, who had
always been In favor of Lea's union with
Georsr. Even if Kdith should not know
the Ortsen's address she would certainly
go to inquire for it at Free College with
out mentioning the 5'oung girl's name.
But how was she to find Edith?
Lea did not know positively where she
was. Daisy had not heard from her for
a long time. The two sisters rarely wrote
to each other. Edith, in her last letter
had spoke of leaving Clariss & Son's and
of becoming a sick nurse â that is to say,
of entering a sort of lay order of which
the members alternately nursed the poor
gratuitously and the rich for large fees.
This idea had fascinated Edith,: who was
disgusted by the immorality of her com-
PRnlons, the glaziers at Clariss & Sona.'
who. she said, with a truly British air of
superiority, "were becoming just Ilk*
French workmen!"
In any case a visit to the factory la
you groin? to work here again 7"
"No." replied Lea, "I am only passing
through London, and I wanted to see one
of my friends who worked here with me
a couple of years ago. You know Miss
Cracgs? She was the forewoman in the
glazing room."
"Miss Craggs Is no longer here, miss.
She left about three months ago, or per
haps three months and a half. I remem
.ber that tho last day she worked here it
snowed; it was ju3t before the end of
spring. She also came again once after
she left here. I did not see her, but my
wife spoke with her, and told me that she
was dressed like a nurse and that she
was leaving for the Continent with a
young woman who was an Invalid." vj: ; J
Lea almost fainted at the words "leav
ing for the Continent," but she controlled
herself.
"You don't know where she has gone
with her patient?"
"No; to tho Riviera, I suppose."
"Did Miss Craggs still live at Kensing
ton, during the last months of her stay In
London?" <
"I don't know, miss, but I think so. She
did not say anything about having
changed her address."
"I will call at the WeBleyan Club," Â«ald
Lea. "Perhaps they may be able to give
me some information there."
"Very likely. Miss Craggs was well
known there.
Lea gave the porter sixpence. H*
Â£hanked her, then, when he nad slipped
the coin in his pocket, he said:
"Have you been ill, miss?"
"No," she replied. ''Why?"
"Oh! it seems to me that you arÂ« much
thinner. Perhaps you have- been over
worked. But if you are quite well, after
all that's the principal thing. Only you
had better stay In London. You were
stronger when you were here. People may
say what they like, it's a good place to
live In. The fog feeds one." ,
At the Wesleyan Club Lea was given
Edith's old address in Kensington road.
. **Ana you naven'i neara rroru ttdlth
Â¦Ince7"
"No. She gave up her room when she
left; I -don't think she will come here
again. As a matter of fact, you are the
tiret person who has asked about her."
Still weuring the spectacles that she had
put on to search through the little card
rack, the landlady looked at Lea atten
tively.
"Have you not been here before?" she
asked.
"Yes, some time agoâ almost two years
ago. 1 sometimes came to see Edith."
"Oh, you looked much stronger at that
time, miss. You must beware of London
at this time of the year. The weather is
very treacherous."
This insistence upon her ailing appear
ance irritated Lea. She bowed curtly and
went out. In the streets she remembered
that the old woman who sold shoes near
the Elephant and Castle had also looked
at her nxedly when she spoke of the Lon
don climate and the ravages wrought by
consumption. She had no elisquietude
about herself, even for a moment, but
she thought: "I must not look ill when
Georg sees me. I want to be pretty and
quite well for him."
During the last two years she had lost
all care about her dress. A keen desire
to please awoke in her. "I will buy a cos
tume so that I may be well dressed when
he sees me," she thought, looking at her
threadbare black cloth skirt.
Revolving these thoughts in her mind
she reached Kensington Gardens again.
The heat was really overpowering in the
sun, though there was a delicious touch of
freshness in the shade. Lea found a shel
tered scat and sat down.
She knew Edith's address at last! She
determined to send a telegram to Nice,
but she must have an address for the re
ply and Lea had not yet found a domicile.
The first thing to do, therefore, was to
rent a room, and as soon as she was In
stalled, telegraph to Edith at the Hotel
Metropole. At the same time, in order
not to neglect any chance she would
write to Georg and Tinka. telling them
she was In London again and resolved to
join them. She would address the two
letters to Free College. It would be nec
essary to count upon two .full days before
Bhe could have a reply. That morning she
would not have admitted that twenty-four
hours could pass before she would be with
Georg. Reality was already imposing Its
delays upon her. Lea supported it better
than she would have done a few hours
earlier, for a new care possessed her: shÂ«
must please Georg when she appeared be
fore him. Two days would barely suffice
to complete the insignificant wardrobe she
had brought with her from Paris in her
traveling Dag. m .
But where could she go 7
Neither Appletree. Yard nor the Pigott
dwelling tempted her. She preferred to
avoid the places where she -had already
lived. She was familiar with London, for
she had walked about it in every direc
tion with Georg, and she quickly decided
to make a choice near the British Mu
seum, where furnished lodgings are plen
tiful and cheap. As soon as she had come
to this decision she got up from her bench.
She then felt. In spite of the extreme heat
of the day. a humidity as of damp gar
ments upon her shoulders, the coolness of
the shade had condensed the perspiration
that her long: walk Â¦ had . created. She
walked quickly, in order to- warm herself,
and only got into an omnibus when she
felt quite dried by the burning sun.
A crushing sensation of fatigue over
came her in the omnibus and she fell
asleep. She awoke with a st^irt in Gower
street, near the Museum. The whole
length of the street to right and Ieift lit
tle signs fixed to the door posts announced
that rooms were to let. She began her
search and selected a house of respectable
appearance kept by Mrs. Cockington and
dauarhterp. where she rented a room for
half a guinea a week, with breakfast in
the morning Included. As soon as she
was settled In the room she wrote two let
ters and the telegram. She compelled
herself to take them to the neighboring
postofflce, but as she felt an Increasing
sensation of lassitude she asked Mrs.
Cockington to send for her bag to the tea
room In Piccadilly. And lying down upon
her bed without even taking off her
clothes, she fell Into a deep sleep.
When she . awoke the room was quite !
gloomy, for the house was masked In
Front by the big Ionic building, the Brit
ish Museum. Lea, somewhat rested, light
ed the gas ".nd looked at herself in the
mirror of the wardrobe. She was filled
with consternation to see herself so poorly
dressed, so thin, so deathly pale, and her
brown hair almost without floss. She

She contemplated the folitude of her
own existence, as phe had done that morn

austerity cf her life peemed frightful. But

Dirrreclce left the piano, and while her

Cennorne Soublxe ehe came and eat be
tide those whom she venerated as the two
?â¢ducators of her soul. She asked about
their pro^ecte. With her feminine intui
tion the divined that Daisy would no
longer be associated with them. Pirnitz
told of her modest ambition to establish
a school In one of the populous quarters
of Paris without any official name; one
that could not be euppressed, for it would
never be Inaugurated, so to epeak.
"If we succeed this time many of the
best pupils In the old school will come to
us."
"That Is Just what Mile. Heurteau
fears," said Duyvecke. "The last time
that I went to the Rue des Vergers to
ask ebout j'ou I saw her. You know she
was very kind to me once, and I liked her
very much. She appeared preoccupied
about your projects, although ehe knew
nothing oJ them. Sho Jet me understand
that she would ask nothing better than
to have you with her at the next reopen
ing. She' undertook to arrange the matter
with the authorities. She repeated: 'If
tJ^.ey are reailv devoted to our work they
Â¦Â»SU return. Tell Krederique, and particu
larly Pirnitz, that they will find the places
due' to them here under the new arrange
ment.' And. to tell the truth," added
Duyvecke. timidly. "I wondered whethei
that would rsot be the best solution of the
difficulty?"
Pirnitz shook hrr head:
\Vh< :i dinner w;Â».s over Duyvecke asked
permission to go anu put little Gaston to
bed. While she was absent Remlneau
poured en:t the coffoe in the Louis X'v r
parlor. His wife returned in a few min
utes, and as they were silent she opened
the piano. Like most of her tountry
womon. she was fond of music and played
agreeably, though without pretension.
Heminoau had no knowledge of music,
but h's admiration for Duyvecke made
him very attentive, and certain melodies
appealed to him. He sat down at a lit
tle distance from his wife, so that he could
pee her jirotllf. and then, as he paid, "in
watching her hands moving over the keys
it seemed to him that Duyvccke's fingers
caressed his heart."
"WJ'at an admirable natural law It is
that the words and the efforts of an apos
tle are never waited! The law that pre

"We shall do our bost. Mile. Pirnitz.
We are neither ungrateful nor wicked. If
we have a daughter, as you say, we shall
bring her up in your ideas, eo that she
will replace Duyvecke some day for you.
Duyvecke made mt promise it, and I did
it with all my neaxt."
Frt-derique, who could not find anything
to say. thought:
"You are not angry with me," she mur
mured. "Thanks! How good you are!"
Rerr.i. rolling little bread pe;lets in his
confusion and eagerness, stammered:
Duyvecke was so moved that tears rose
to her eyes, but they were tears of hap
piness. She bent over Pirnitz, and, with
one of her caressing gestures, rather stu
pid but which made hejf so attractive, sho
placed her cheek against that of the apos
tle.
"You are right. Daisy," said PImltz.
Â¦with hor penetrating voice. "No one is
forced to bear a burden too heavy for her
ehouldc-rs. Only, one's shoulders are al
most always stronger than erne's heart;
that is to pay. one has always less ardor
than Ftrenjrth. Don't think I am refer

to give yourself to our work completely.
Fate took you by the hand und guided
you to marriage, to maternity, to the or
dinary life of pure women. You will
rr.ake It resplendent with the noble
dreams of your childhood and youth. If
the child bcrn to you be a girl I am sure
she win become, through you, a conscious
and free being."
"Pshaw!" eaid Daisy. "You have done
what you could. Nobody is obliged to
carry a burden too heavy for her shoul

"That is well eald!" cried Remlneau ap
provingly.
"No matter, there are moments In our
happiness when I think of our meetings
at poor Mile. d<? Saint e-Parade's house, of
the Inauguration of the school, and of my
French and geography classes! And my

beautiful, and nothing In future will ap

Duyvecke frowned at him. and he be
came siient, laughing in his Jet black
beard. Frodoricjue began to feel a little
disgust for this conjugal love, with its
stories of kisses and maternity which
cropped up in the conversation at her

"Drive to Xo. 3 Appletree Tard."
She got in, the hansom turned nimbly,
made its way across the crowded court
yard, along the Strand, already thronged
r.nd extraordinarily animated, and around
Trafalgar square, where the summit of
the column loomed up faintly in the fog.
In less than five minutes Lea got out be
fore her old dwelling. The little yellow
house had not changed, but a big build
ing in front which she remembered to
have been in the course of construction
wrs now finished and occupied. And this
was enough to modify the aspect of the
alley. Lea did not feel the emotion she
had imagined when she had thought in
Paris of a return to the places where .she
had known such ideal Joy. It astonished
her sadly.
"Is Mrs. Snyders here?" she asked the
fresh colored pretty ; little maid who
opened the door.
"Oh! no." replied the glrL "Mrs. Sny
ders moved more than six months ago,
after the death qf her husband. We leave
the name on the door plate," she added,
following the direction of Lea's glance,
"because my mistress. Miss PInkflower.
also lets rooms. Do you wish to take one?
There are several at liberty If you like,
and they are better than before. Miss
Pinkflower has put in new furniture. And
a window has been added to the room at
the end of the passage,-- Would you like
to see It. ma'am?"
"No, thank you." said Lea, stopping the
little servant's prolix chatter with some
difficulty, "I simply wanted to know if
you had the address of a gentleman who
lived here with hia sister in 1S97 and 1S98â
Mr. Georg Ortsen."
The little servant puckered up her fore
head as though making a desperate effort
of memory.
"No. I don't remember any one of that
name."
"There used to be an address book at
tho time these persons lived here. Havo
you not got it now?"
"I don't think so, ma'am."
"It used to be kept in the drawer of that
little table near the staircase."
"I will look. Oh, how curious! Here It
Is! What a good memory you have,
ma'am. I have never seen it before,
though I clean here every day."
"Yes, that is it," said Lea, taking the
oblong register In its black cloth binding.
She turned over the pages, guiding her
search by the dates. a"nd quickly found:
"Georg Ortsen; Professor and Frau Hoe
del. Apply to Free College, Allen street,
Kensinprton road."
It was evident that upon leaving for a
voyage nf which the itinerary was not
completely mapped out the Ortsena had
derided It was best to leave their mail in
care of Mme. Sanz.
"Thank you," said Lea, returning the
book.
"You don't care to stop here, ma'am?
There is a very pretty front room, with a
view Into John street."
And in a. lower tone she added, with di
verting boldness in her regard:
"Mies Pinkflower ia very kind and our
ladies are free to do as they like,"
"Thanks." said Lea, thinking: "The
house has indeed changed. What would
the worthy and melancholy Mrs. Snyders
say?"
The cabman, wrapped in h!s surly dig

CHAPTER IV.
About 9 o'clock In the morning of the
day following her flight, when Lea left
Charing Cross station and saw before her,
dripping with rain that had just ceased
falling, the courtyard, with its little
Gothic monument, and further off, In the
fog, the Nelson monument and the clumsy
tower of the National Gallery, she was
suddenly overwhelmed by the reality.
Since the preceding eveningâ since the
moment when she had stood in the porch
of St. Augustln's Church, and had
watched the cab that carried her letter
of farowell disappear in the Boulevard
Male.shorbes. she had lived in a dream.
A Joyous fever, free from sadness or re
morse, seemed to have suddenly trans
formed everything for her. The block
of load that had crushed her down from
her infancy had fallen from her shoulders
and she felt light and froe.
"How omuM l wait so long?"
It surprised her after her liberation.
And her movements had followed each
other rapidly and Rladlyâ the fervent
prayer before the altar, the dinner in the
St. Lazare station, the departure at 9
o'clock, the royage. Hor feverish happi
ness tilled the hours; she had not even
time to be impatient. Admirable fever, so
rare that many human existences never
know it. too brief oven for those whom
it emancipates for a moment from the
petty cone tions of daily life and carries
outside the limits of time and space!
A fever that is. perhaps, the fupremest
human happiness, that is fed by reality
and that transports the human being be
yond the confines of material existence!
Lea felt the enthusiasm of the poet who
conceives a work and imagines it as he
will never i>e able to execute it.
To go to Georg. to offer him and receive
from him tho nipremest gift, appeared to
hor near, certain and easy. These super
human fevers burn themselves out by
thtir very excess. When they have ar
rived at their term an ordinary incident
brings them suddenly to an end. The po<:-t,
his brain inflamed, sits down before his
desk, dips the pen nervously In the ink,
f^cr.iwls a muddy line on the white paper â
and it is sufficient to disclose all the sud
den difficulty of the ta?k and to dissipate
tho mirage of his ideal conception. Until
London w.s reached Loa had only to allow
herself to bo transported. But when once
in the courtyard of Charing Cross station
she had to go through this simple act in
the morning mist, to call a hansom cab
and give an address to the driver. What
address? This was the reminder of neces
sity, the return to reality, the end of her
dream.
res, what address? Where must she go
first. Time took its real value in her dis
illusioned mind. London had not changed;
the view of roofs and monuments in the
busy, populous corner was exactly the
fame to trie traveler's eyes; but the period
e>f Free College, of Clariss' workshop, of
the little community in Appletree Yard
was two years old! Where was she to
lind Georer, even were he still in the
monster city? How could she discover
his traces were he no longer there? All
that had appeared so easy and triumph
ant to the poor girl when she left Paris
suddenly became difficult and humiliating
upon arriving in London.
"I'm losing my best time, ma'am," said
the dignified and grumbling cabman from
his high seat.
He was waiting for her to decide, after
having placed her portmanteau on tha
ppitp of the protestations of Duyvecke and
her husband.
"Wo have to wake at dawn every day,"
paid i'irnitz. laughing, "like birds whose
nest has boon destroyed by the storm, and
who nre working to build another."
They were In the anteroom putting on
their cloaks. Duyvecke said, appealing

"Oh! before you go. come and see Gas

Remineau and the three women followed
Duyvecke, carrying the lamp along the
corridor, and entered the child's bedroom
on tiptoe. It was a very little one and
adjoined the husband and wife's bed

op,>n door. The conjugal bed was in
full view, its coverlet turned down and
a night light upon the table. The bed

maidenly irritation she noticed the single
depression in the middle. They would re
pose there shortlyâ that big, black haired
rustic, v.-hose eyes watched his first born

haired girl whose waist, enlarged by her
forthcoming maternity, he encircled ten

tho hnlo of light her delicate face and
Romaine's rude visage were framed to
gether above Gaston's bed. Remlneau
kim>ed lii.s wife upon the neck.
"Lot us po!" murmured Frederiqu<iL
"Let us so!"
Cutting short the leave taking, sh*
craspod her two companions away. She
was anxious to no longer breathe this
conjugal aimo.sphere. which stifled her.
All her affection for the Duyvecke of old
was r ffacr-d. Sho bore away with her the
picture of a woman with her clumsy form
and a workman kissing her on the nape
of hor neck.
"Oh: the possibility that I may some
day pee Lea thus! Oh. no! I prefer never
to see hrr againâ never!"
At that very moment the frail object
which crosses ppace and. makes all doors
open before it ns though by some myste
rious enchantmentâ a letter bearing a lit
tle of the absent girl's thoughtsâ left the
foppy island whore Frederique had for
jnerly mot Georg Ortsen. crossed the sea
in a biting equinoctial night, and unfal
teringly followed Its route toward the
house in the Rue de la Sourdiere.
Sho also learned that the nurses formed a
sort of syndicate, with their headquarters
at the club, where they met once a month.
Lea took another omnibus and recrossed
London in the opposite direction. It was
almost noon when sho got to Kensington
Gardens. It was one of those sultry,
misty days frequent In London about the
dog days, when the heat is so fatal to the
stray dogs In the streets. Lea did not feel
tired, for she was wrought up by the
semi-certainty of learning 1 Â¦- Edith's ad
dress at last. She passed the end of
Allen street, and could not help glancing
toward Free College, of which she could
see the outline of the gables, with the
Jutting hexigonals of the bay windows.
She increased her pace, afraid of meeting
Mme.* Sanz or one of the mistresses whom
ehe knew. A few minutes later she rang
the bell at the little house where Edith
had lived formerly. The landlady herself.
Mme. Plgott, operied the door. She did
not seem to recognize Lea, who, however,
recognized hpr at once.
"Miss Edith is on the Continent with a
young invalid," said Mrs. Pigott in reply
to Lea's question; "but I can give you the
address she left. Will you please come
In?"
The tiny boarding-house parlor present
ed .the same appearance, with its conven
tional wedding service In silver plate,
which the widow displayed upon the dark
mahogany dresser. Some visiting cards'
were hanging In a little tapestried rack.
Mrs. Pigott. putting on a pair of spec
tacles, found Edith's with some difficulty
and read the address out loud to Lea.
"Miss Cr&gga, nurse, Hotel Metropole,
Nice."
"What Is the date of that address?"
"The end of April."
dalnful expression upon his face became
more emphatic. Lea got Into the cab
again. She dared not give the address of
Free College, but, satisfied with the defi
nite information she had obtained and
feeling rather hungry, she told the. man
to drive to a teahouse in Piccadilly, a sort
of modest London milkroom, where she
had formerly taken tea with Tinka and
Frederique. The little shop had been torn
down and replaced by an imposing build
ing with immense mirrors, mahogany orn
amentation and handsome fittings. How
ever, Lea got out of the cab, paid the
driver and entered with her valise. She
asked for eggs, tea and some orange mar
melade. While eating with an appetite
that she had not had for some time, she
thought:
"I have only to take an omnibus and go
to Free College, and I shall know in a
few moments."
who was not displeased to ex
change a few words with a human
being, told her that she had only arrived
from France that morning, the stout
woman warned her to be careful, as the
evenings were very cold after the warm
afternoons, and consumption was ravag
ing London cruelly Just then. Lea smiled
and took a deep breath Into her youthful
lungs. They arrived at the corner of
Hampton street and Lea said good-by to
her traveling , companion. Then, at an
alert pace, she walked to the workshop.
The porter, an old man with the purplo
nose, of a drunkard, was sweeping the
muddy tiles. It was several moments be
fore-he recognized her. She had to tell
film her name. Â»Â¦ â¢ -
"Ah! Miss Legay-Surier!" he cried. And
the name in his mouth became a strange
complicated sound, like the war cry of a
Sioux Indian or of a Salakave. "Oh! you
have come back to London, miss? Axe
Walworth road would not- lower Lea's
eelf-respect. She paid for her mealâ much
dearer than when in the time of the little
shop "but the big mirrors and mahogany
paneling had to be paid forâ and asked
the cash girl to keep her little traveling
bag for a couple of hours, a request that
the girl consented to with the gruff polite
ness of London shop girls. Lea gcft into
the green omnibus she had taken bo often
when, she worked at Clariss*. The weath
er, had brightened up toward half past
nine, and the July sun, gradually more
powerful and sultry, quickly dried the
muddy sidewalks and streets. A fat
woman sitting opposite Lea upon the vel
vet cushions spoke to her, asked her
where she was going, told her that she
owned a shoeshop near the Ele
phant and Castle. And as Lea,
It thus became more Imperative to con
sult Mme. Sanz. Lea tried to accustom
herself to the Idea. "I am quite free. BÂ»
sides, Mme. Sanz is so reasonable." But
she was terrified Immediately by the fear
of meeting Pirnitz and Frederique face to
face, a fear augmented by her Imagina
tion. She felt that such a meeting would
paralyze her will. She had been able to
run away, to escape unknown to them
but to say to them to their face. "No i
will not live with you!" she felt she could
not do. She then meditated writing to
Mme. Sanz. to appeal to her for help with
out betraying her retreat. She was al
most decided to take this step when an
untoward incluent retarded Its execution.
One Sunday, eleven days after her ar
rival In London, she let herself be ner
suaded to accompany the little â¢Cocklmr
ton girls and their mother to a party on
Wimbledon Common, the pirls' sweet
hearts accompanying them. The Ludirate
Hill salesman was a big. Jovial fellow
Irish by birth, the devil-may-care of the
band. The Lambeth policeman, on the
contrary, even in his recreation, had the
air of being on duty. . and seemed as
though he had come to arrest the entire
group and lead them off sternly to the
police station. Lea found little pleasure
fa the excursion: but she felt a keen joy
in\mentally comparing the man she loved
net- Ideally handsome, artistic and noble
Georg, with the two men who were the
representatives of love for Rose and
Mary. No, It was certain that only her
She decided to try again and sought out
the London publisher of Tlnka's books.
She found him without much difficulty,
his offlces being situated in a very old
house in Paternoster Row, near St. Paul's
Cathedral, a he clerks were very obliging
for this pretty, well-dressed young
woman, -who spoke English so purely,
with an indefinable and graceful accent.
They consulted the address book and
found the name. "Mrs. Tinka Ortsen, 3
Appletree Yard, crossed out and under
neath it written, "Mrs. Hoedel-Ortsen,
Free College, Kensington Road."
"I have written to Free College," Â«ald
Lea, "but have received no reply,"
"Really," said the clerk, with a politely
regretful air.
"When you write to Mrs. Ortsen do you
address her letters to Free Colleger*
"Oh, we never write to her directly. Our
correspondent for her works la at Stock
holm, as we deal directly with the Swed
ish editor. Mrs. Ortsen has never been
here."
But the time elapsed since she
dispatched her letters became abnormal
and excessive and she began to bo
alarmed in abrupt agonizing attacks. She
said tp herself, fortifying herself against
despair: "It is only a delay. Jt Is abso
lutely certain that I shall discover Georg
and Tinka."
Assisted by the comical, if a little vul
gar, kindness of the two girls, she domi
nated her distress wJth the energy im
planted in her by the lessons of Freder
ique and Pirnitz. Already underllnen
trimmed with pretty lace, fresh skirts and
chemisettes, a pretty hat and a tailor
made costume of the last Paris fashion
were hanging In the mirrored wardrobe
of her room, all acquired at a small cost.
Lea discovered that she possessed a co
quettish aptitude for dressmaking and
millinery, a faculty that she had not sus
pected hitherto, with a little of her moth
er's deftness in her fingers. This change of
work, In fact, and the pleasure she found
in it, made her think of her mother. While
arranging pleats, sewing Jet and and cloth
trimming and listening to the Idle, di
verting chatting of Rose and Mary, she
wrs conscious of this similarity of na
ture with poor Christine. She even whis
pered: "Mother! My dear mother! I am
just like you!" Now that she was no
longer under the influence of Frederique
and Pirnitz, now that she was really
alone and without family, her thoughts
naturally turned toward her pretty, affec
tionate mother. Christine would have
understood Lea's loving Â¦weakness so well.
She would have encouraged her daughter
to be beautiful for him whom she loved.
Toward the end of the week Lea began
to be alarmed at her failure to receive a
reply. She suffered from sleeplessness,
and her health suffered. Mrs. Cockington
informed her of it. The desire to bo
pretty and attractive when she saw
.Georg again stimulated her anew.
A few tear3 would then be shed, for tho
ruin of Mr. Cockington in an important
spinning factory at Derby was a favorite
pubject with Mrs. Cockington. Probably
this crash had carried off the gentleman
himself, with the fortune of the house
hold, for he â¢was never seen. and. although
iio explanation of the matter was -given,
neither the girls nor their mother ap
peared to have any hope of his reappear
ance on the scene. Mrs. Cockington re
ferred to Him with gTeat sympathy, paid
homage to his great capacity and damned
the people who brought about his failure.
The three women walled about the scar
city of boarders. Had it not been for Lea
and the Ludgate Hill salesman the house
would have been empty. Thanks to ex
cessive competition, the "foreign trade,"
they said, had become dreadful in Lon
don.
"Rondon is full of lodgings, kept by
heaven knows whom!" declared Mrs.
Cockington. "Just look at Gower street!
There's a sign at every door! Ah. If my
husband's spinning factory in Derby had
succeeded we should not have been re
duced to such a wretched business!"
suddenly remembered the radiant, charm
ing image she used to see In the mirror in
Appletree Yard. â¢'-:â¢>
"These people are right," she thought,
"I have cnanged very much." ,
She was glad she had not met Georg
that day.
"He might not have been able to recog- 
nize me. I have grown so old and ugly;
even since the day he saw me last In the
big room of the school."
She asked for a bath, and when she had
taken it and was once more In her room
she made a careful toilet. She Inspected
herself in the mirror as she had never
done before,- even at the age when young
girls have the most predilection for dress.
She was another Lea, one who had never
yet revealed herself, now that the In
fluence of Pirnitz and Frederi>iue was
abolished. She had even coquettish arti
fices that no one had ever taught her, of
wjjich she herself had not previously been
aware, for the arrangement of her hair,
tha improvement of her figure and com
plexion. She took out of the valise, when
it was brought to her from Piccadilly, the
few rags she had collected in haste the
evening of her departure, a rather pretty
blouse of flowered mauve foulard, some
cambric chemises and drawers, very sim
ply made; but. unfortunately, no shoes,
petticoats or skirts for a change. And the
miserable hat. the governess' toque she
had worn with perfect indifference in
Paris, must be replaced by a graceful,
stylish hat for the meeting with her be-
When she went down to the dining
room for supper the two girls, Ilose and
Mary Cockingtonâ Rose an odd little crea
ture, like a young tortoise shell cat. with
a slender, nimble body; Mary, lymphatic
and fair, but as tiny and almost as quicK
as Roseâ complimented her upon her
dress and appearance. Their mother, a
bony, dried up, fair complexioned woman,
pretentiously dressed and looking like the
elder sister or her daughters, went even
further and declared that only trench
women knew how to dress so exquisitely.
Lea was pleased to find herself really
brighter, younger, prettier than when sne
had arrived. And the compliments of the
obsequious Cockington family, whose
meal she shared, did not displease her
She had to give them some account of
herself, so she said she had lost her trunk
upon the Continent, and being in London
for several days waiting for an address
Â»he was going to profit from them to buy
and make the different things that she
lacked. The young girls offered to help
her. They were good dressmakers, they
said, and "as a matter of fact theÂ£ were
not too badly rigged out. It wastogreed
that they should begin the next day. No
attempt was made to invite Leas'.confi
dence. The English are very discreet and
pay very little attention to the affairs
of others. Besides, the new boarder had
paid a week in advance, and had given
Clariss & Sons as reference, stating that
she had formerly been employed there.
The air of liberty is so intoxicating after
years of servitude that Lea supported the
first days of waiting without too much
impatience. During these first days she
received no reply either to the telegram
or the two letters; but this did not aston
ish her, as she had written to old ad
dresses. In addition the time passed so
quickly in the creation of a veritable
trousseau in the society of Mary and
Rose, who gently and gayly teased the
young French girl, told her they were
sure she was going to be married, and
that the person she was awaiting was
simply her lover. Nothing more was said
about the trunk lost on the Continent.
The little; Cockington girls had built up
an ingenious romance: the French girl
had run away from her parents to come
and marry the man she loved in England.
They regarded this as .both natural and
charming, and told Lea so. They would
each have done the same if "mamma" had
tried to separate them from their "sweet
heart"âfor each had a sweetheart with
whom she went for a walk on Sundays
and half holidays. Rose was engaged to
a young policeman in the Lambeth dis
trict and Mary to a salesman in a large
tailoring establishment at Ludgate Hill,
wbo, being one of Mrs. Cockington'B
boarders, had apparently taken one of the
daughters with his lodging. As for Mrs.
Cockington. she disappeared mysteriously
from time to time, disappearances that
now and again extended over a couple of
days without causing any surprise to her
daughters.
In the ineanttme Lea began to feel a
slight pain between her shoulders. She
attributed it to the stooping position Â«he
maintained over her drawing board al
most all day. She attempted to draw
standing up. but the accesses of pain
with a pricking sensation in her hack
persisted. Then nightly perspiration.** be
gan to occur. She was rather surprised
without being alarmed, for she ignored
what the symptom Indicated. She did not
e-M'ak about it to any one. Rose. Mary
tpir mother and the Smith family, who
noticed a change In her from day to day
tried to make her understand that her
health was threatened; that she must
take eare of her lungs; that an epidemic
of consumption was raging in the city.
Lea reassured them and herself by reply
ing. "I never cough and never have done
so. She had. In fact, no flta of painful
coughing: she did not even have a cold;
but she felt her throat almost constantly
obstructed by an obstacle that she cleared
away with a little spasmodic cough. She
ate with a good appetite, and she slept
much better since her attacks of noctur
nal perspiration.
beloved Georg could ever receive a regard
from her or one of her thoughts. It had
needed this semi-god, descended from the
Northern Valhalla, to initiate her in th->
possibility of loving. "I should never
have yielded a particle of myself to an
other!" And she spoke truly: upon this
point Lea differed from her mother. It
was here that the Influence of the teach
ers of her soul. Frederique and Pirnitz.
remained victorious over her. Lea could
become a woman only through one man m
the world. The smiling grace, the piierilo
tenderness and even the coquetry of h* r
mother had perhaps been transmitted to
her but they had been awakened in n<=r
as 'a homage to C.eorg Orsten alone, to
him who had penetrated her soul through

A little boat was hired at !â¢ ulnam and
they sculled down the river, each of tho
lovers doing his best to show off his sav.I.
The day had been intensely hot and thw
coolness of the river surprised the excur
sionists very agreeably. Lut when they
attained Battersea. as the sun no longer
tempered the air. a sudden fog rose from
the surface, a fog so dnmp and cold that
after an hour of pair.fui navigation even
Rose and Mary asked to be set on ->rnre.
They cot out of tho boat as soon as they
could with a thou?and rTc<-autions r pr.
dered necessary by the thick fop. It was
half an hour's walk to tho district rail
way station, and on reaching r.omo every
body was moody and frozen. Lea fell ill
immediately and had to remain In b^d.
She had been poisoned, as It were hy tho
river's breath, and it seemed to her that
her back and limba were gripped as in ;t
vise. She was very feverish during thÂ»
night and Mrs. Cockington in alarm called
in a doctor to examine the girl. After a
minute auscultation he declared tnat she
had a touch of bronchitis not very s
rious and that she would be quite we
again in a few days. Lea was nursed
very kindly and devotedly by Rose and
Mary, the bronchitis was thrown off. and
four days after the unfortunate excur
sion the" Invalid was on her feet again.
Thanks to the warmth of the afternoons,
she could enjoy the sunlight on condition
that she came In before evening.
More than a week passed in this wav.
and still no reply arrived to the letters
sent eighteen days before. V. hen I^.i
had completely recovered sho found upon
her table one morning after breakfast an
envelope containing the doctor 3 bill, an
other for medicine and also one for the
week's board which remained unpaid.
Altogether they amounted to about three
poumls^ gud( jen chill at her templea.
She had spent a great deal In buying her
outfit, never thinking that so many days
would pass before she rejoined </eors.
She searched in her purse, in all tho
drawers. With every coin, even the
pence, added together, she collected th^
amount required, and there still remained
6 shillings and 6 pence. She paid the biha.
but. immediately seized with terror at
the possibility of debtâ the terror of peo
ple who have always lived within their
meansâ she ~ressed herself, went out. and
taking one omnibus after another, reach
ed Walworth road and the workshops of
Clarlss & Sons. As she had enjoyed tho
reputation of being an excellent designer,
she was immediately re-engaged by the
manager with a salary of Â£3 a week.
But she had to bind herself to remain
three months, except in case of iilnes3.
She signed everything they wished.
"Georg will find me working as in former
times. 8he thought, "and that will be
better." The terror of finding herself sud
denly without money overpowered all
other considerations.
Then a life of uninterrupted labor began
for the young girl, which at least had th*
effect ot diverting her attention from her
anxiety. She arrived at the factory at 9
o'clock in the morning, toiled until 6. and
In the evening resumed work passionately
upon her bridal trousseau; for. adopting
Rose's and Mary's idea, it was really a
wedding trous?eau ?he was preparing.
And the hope that the underlinen. laces
and light silks would be unfolded before
Georg's eyes, would be regarded anl
touched by him. made the work delight
ful to her. She thought of It all day whilo
designing at the workshop. In the even-
Ing, when her daily toil was ended, she
hastened to this work of love, as to a
meeting with her lover. And little by lit
tle, intoxicated by her dream, and
through the increasing anaemia due to
excessive labor and nervousness, she be
gan to find nothing too luxurious for
Georg's wife. All that she earned was
spent immediately in costume, in perfume,
in something to adorn or beautify her.
She was now minutely attentive to tho
tiniest details of her tcilet and had re
covered her former beauty. No one could
meet without noticing the tall, slender
young girl, so sunple of figure, fo grace
ful In movement, her romantic face lit up
by the feverishly brilliant eyes beneath
the fluid brown of her hair.
She went through life insensible to ad
miration, thinking of one thins only,
thinking of it with an unhealthy ardor
and continually, of the hour when sho
would be in Georg's arms and caressed
by his lips.
â¢â¢I shall be his wife!"
She repeated the words aloud when
alone, like some incantation. Her ardor
became keener than her health and thÂ«
strength of her constitution diminished.
An unchaste breath swept over the mystic
flower of her former affection, welling up
from the depths of her nature, emaciated
bv work and fever. Without knowing
precisely what she desired, ahÂ© felt that
Georgia presence and his caresses would
satisfy her longings. And. while dream
ing of a renewal of his caresses, Â»hÂ«
counted again and again, like a miser, th^
treasure of her former ones â Georges hand
stroking her hair on Hampstead Heath;
the afternoon when she had fallen asleep,
tired after a long walk, upon a sofa in
the hotel at Richmond, while hÂ« watched
over her, sitting by her side. and. above
all the captlvatlon of her lips in the. car
riage, the kiss without end given her thÂ«
name evening when returning home to
gether. All these souvenirs, which for
merly terrified her. of which the recol
lection had caused her veritable suffering 1 ,
now pleased her. She dwelt upon them
continually, dreaming of them during tha
day over her drawing board In the work
shop; in the evening while sewing by
lamplight with Mary and Rose. They
haunted her above all at night In thÂ«
hours of Insomnia that consumed her
without weighing heavily upon her.
In this state of contented somnambulism
the days passed. August was half over
and although Lea had not yet received
any reply she has not taken the. one step
(a visit to Mme. Sanz) that would have
been really efficacious. She had even
tacitly abandoned the Idea. A sort of mys
tic faith upheld her. She believed firmly
that Georg and she would meet again
without any effort upon her part by thÂ«
simple action of\destiny.Just as they had
met and loved at first. Did not their en
tire history bear the Imprint of aucn fa
talism? It should finish by tho same force
of a superhuman guidance. Lea. no longer
went out without being prepared for a
meeting with Georg. It was for him' that
she adorned herself and made herself
beautiful. And her heart often stopped,
beating when a form, a footstep, a voice,
seemed for an Instant to have turned to
reality the vague hope of a meeting.
The mystery which surrounded Lea's
life naturally Interested Mrs. Cocklngton
and her daughters In the extreme, as well
as the new boarders In the house. An
American family of fiveâ father, mother,
two tall and. very pretty young girls and
a boy of twelve of delicate appearance
had arrived from Chicago in the early
days of August and descended upon Gow
er street to the great joy of tho landlady.
They all spoke of Lea as "the girl who
Is engaged," and treated her with much
deference. But the American household
was anxious about her health. Mr. Smith,
the l.usband. had studied a little medicine
and declared the young girl was con
sumptive. He was rather alarmed about
It for the sake of hia daughters and little
son. Mrs. Cocklngton reassured him as
best she could, exaggerating Lea'a excel
lent constitution, and carefully refrained
from mentioning the attack of bronchitis
that had followed the boating excursion.
She trembled at the thought of losing a
group of rich boarders like the Smiths.
who had the intention of remaining in,
London all winter.

Mr. Steininger, chief dispatcher of the

railroad offices at Third and Townsend

the other he was eating lunch from a

"We are very busy Just now," said Mr.
Steininger. "You see, It keeps U3 Jump
ing sometimes, and to get anything to
eat at all one has to manage in this way.
Decoration day we had so many specials
out that none of us got any lunch, except
Jeff here, who brought a sandwich in his
pocket."
Mr. Jefferey, who was thus referred to,
emlled with the satisfaction of one who
had Been to It that there was oil in his
lamp. He Is one of the company's oldest
dispatchers, having been at the tables for
some twenty-five years. Mr. Walters,
who Is also a dispatcher of many years'
standing:, explained to me the workings of
the chart, which was simply a lax?e tabu-
WHAT If yon were way up In the
sky in a bajloon, where you
could get a bjrdseye view of all
the coast railroads between San
Francisco and Santa Barbara,
a perfect network of them; where you
could see trains running about in all di
rections, hundreds of themâ trains run
ning and screeching, trains standing im
patiently on side tracks, trains whizzing
past each other, trains .backing, switch-
Ing and breaking In two -in the middle,
trains meeting, dodging, whistling and
tearing over the ground for dear life.
What if you should suddenly find your
self able to control each one of those hun
dreds of trains by the touch of a button;
what if you could reach out a finger ar.d
set two trains moving on tho same track-,
coming from opposite directions; what if
you cculd send them straight ahead, with
their, burdens of human lives, straight
ahead to death and destructionâ
That would be your power.
But what If you should also find your
self responsible for the fate of each of
those trains, and master of their move
ments; that not Â«ne of them should be
allowed tc move or to stop moving except
by your, order, and that they must all
be kept moving, each toward Its proper
destination: that you must give orders
which would be unquestionably executedâ
orders for the meeting, and the passing,
and the stopping of each'of them, with
tha whole' network so figured out as to
allow no possibility of a collision or other
accidentâ and when the orders were given
to have the whole situation Immediately
changed by all of the trains beginning
to move under your direction, each mo
ment bringing about a new combination
by reason of the changing positions of
each of yo\ir hundreds of changes. How
would you do it, keeping each one moving
with as little delay as possible and guard
ing against all possible accident? To
-watch the movements of three hundred
trains that control their destinyâ
That would bo your responsibility.
Such a power and such a responsibility
lated paper, upon which were kept the
time of the arrivals and departures of the
various trains from every stationâ all very
mysterious and confusing to the uniniti
ated.
"But you see," explained Mr. Walters,
"these charts become as familiar to us as
the keyboard of a typewriter to a skilled
writer, and we can put our finger3 upon
the location of the different trains just as
easily as the writer can find his letters.
When everything goes all right we have
no trouble. Each train is so arranged as
not. to Interfere with the other, but im
agine what a jumble it causes if one of
them gets disabled. The whole combina
tion Is immediately broken up, and all the
trains affepted have to have orders to
run so many minutes late, to lay over at
snme station or to change meeting points
âit changes the orders for all of them.
End the dispatcher has his ha/ids full for
a while to get things straightened out.
If It's a wreck, tho wrecking engines have
to b^ started out and everything possible
done to protect life and property; at the
same time arrangements have to be
thought of for other trains on other lines,
so as to make as little delay as possible;
new time to run on, new places to pass
at. new stations to wait for the passing
of other trainsâ all at the same time, and
then, maybe. In the middle of it all, some
thing somewhere else will go wrongâ a
breakdown, a hot box, the pulling out of
a drawheadâ any little thing like that will
cause a change in everything all over the
system."
I began to man-el. "The mental strainâ
the tension," said I. "It must be ter
"Sometlmes," was the reply, "it la a
great strain, and every moment at the
table is so full of responsibility that one
13 never free from the feeling of tension.
A man Tho has been at It long gets to be
a crankâ that Is a well known fact."
"Talking about tension," Interrupted
Mr. Jefferey. "think of the mental ten
sion of a dispatcher who has made a
mistake; where he has given fatal orders
ar.d can do nothing to countermand them;
where he knows that a collision Is Inevit
able and simply has to sit and wait till it
takes place."
"I knew such a case down In Mexico
once," raid Mr. Walters, in that manner
which betrays the possession of interest
ing stories. "The dispatcher was a young
fellow on the night trick or watch.
Through mistake he had given orders to
two trains on the same track to meet at
different stations. It was what v.e call a
lap crdcrâ that Is, the orders overlapped.
He did not discover his mistake until both
trains had passed all Intervening stations.
He called up the last station on both or
ders and the operator reported that the
tr^ln had passed in both instances. It
wa3 a long run between those stations,
and he had a full fifteen minutes to wait.
He was all alone at his table and there
was no possible means of stepping those
two passenger-laden trains. He could do
nothing. The poor fellow collapsed com
pletely, and when I happened to drop Into
the office before going to bed I found him
prostrate at the table, with a pistol bar
rel to his head, waiting until the instru
ment ticked the message of the accident.
I snatched the pistol from him and tried
to brace him up. He was as white as
death and completely unmanned. I called
up the operator at the station and asked
what kind of a track they had down there
âlevel or hilly. 'Country full of hills;
crooked track; lots of curves.' That was
bad. A level track, where the engineers
could see, might have saved them: but
as it was things looked black. We waited
a few moments, then the Instrument
clicked. The two trains had met on a
curve, but had stopped within a few feet
of each other. One of the engineers had
seen the reflection of the headlight on the
clouds before he could see the enjine and
had stopped his train In time to send a
man ahead and flag the other train."
"And the man â the dispatcher." I said "
"He must have felt relieved. What did
he do?"
"Relieved? Well. I rather guess he was!
But he was never fit for anything after
wardâlost confidence in himself. It is all
off with a dispatcher' when once he make3
a mistakeâ it seems to break his contl
dence in himself completely, and if he
stays at it it, is two to one he will make
another mistake in a short time.
"Like poor r-?!,^rccr', a dispatcher I
knew up in the h?S^MÂ» v!;.-;- : >â¢-.." said Mr.
Jefferey. "He wad at my table, but had
a different trick. I came In one night and
took his table while he went out to sup
per. Happening to look over his order
book I discovered a lap order. A passen
ger -and freight were booked to run
through each other between two' stations
down the line. There was plenty of time
to stop the business, as they had an hour
and twenty minutes' time to do it. so I
sent a message changing the meeting
place to one of the stations, with orders
for the freight to get there first and take
a sidetrack. Bohannan came back whist
ling about ten minutes before the collision
was due and I called him over and showed
him the order book. He looked at his
watch and made a dash for the table.
'Too late,' said I; 'reports from both sta
tions say they've both gone through. \My
God,' gasped the poor fellow, and went
down In a heap. I had only meant to
scare him a little, but It pretty nearly
finished him. He had been a good dis-
pateher. but after that he was so nervous
he never amounted to anything and threa
months later he made another mistake.
That ended him. Well." he concluded. "It
Is pretty rough ort tho nerves of all of us.
Wp all pet to be cranks."
â¢â¢DIsratehers," sa!d Mr. Luke with dlg

a quiet, portly gentleman nr another cor

ture In h!s face to ever aspire to be a
complete crar.k. "Poets." he continued.
"have, according to public opinion, a
monopoly on that method of origin, but
we are In on tho trust."
I had no doubt of It. Those four calm

players at a game of rhes?â or!y thÂ« gnmo
was Infinitely harder and the stakes were
numberless human lives.
They tcld me of an o!d dispatcher over
In Oakland who has been some thirty
years at the table, "â¢night hours a day."
*aid Sir. Waiters, "and swearing every
moment of every one of those eight hours.
He sits down to his work swearing and
never ceases till he gets up. Hl3 profanity
Is directed at everything In general all
over the systrm and is Interspersed with
soliloquy uncomplimentary to operators.
conductors and human nature all round.
"No. I won't give you more tim?." ha
will say with sn oath as ho taps off a
message, and all the time he Is trying his
best to do wj-at he is asked. It 1st laugh
able to hÂ»ar him. but he is very much in.
earnest and never makes a mistake."
"For that matter none of ua do." re
markod the laconic Mr. Luke. "If we did
we wouldn't be dispatchers long." Which
is very tree. The dispatcher Is require*
to be a3 nearly Infallible as any human
being can be. He Is trusted with thou
sands of lives ar.d must be worthy of his
trust.
There were some half dozen little In
struments tappircr away on the table. To
me they meant nothing In particular, ex
cept noise. Cut to the dispatcher;* they
were like so many voices, which they
could not help hut hear If they tried. It
was peculiar to note the expression of
intelligent listening on every face during?
moments when no one was speaking.
They heard the half dozen voices all the
same.
"I suppose you hear many entertaining
things over there among all that clicking
and tapping." paid I. nodding toward tho
busy instruments.
â¢Oh. yes." replied Mr. "Walters, "and
we receive some queer messages. One
night I was sitting at my desk In a dis
patchers' office down in Texas. Every
thing was s'nv.- and quiet. All at ence t
heard the word 'wreck' spelled very
slowly. I waited a moment and it cam*
again. T did rot know what to make of
it, and could only wait. It was repeated
for the third time, and then the Instru
ment started off steadily with a message,
saying that a passenger train had run off
the line, that there was a bar! accident,
two coaches ditched, a number of peopla
killed and assistance was needed. Then
followed the name of the locality and
the words 'If you got this say "Ye3" slow
ly, three times.' I did not know how ths
message was sent until afterward, but t
spelled y-e-s very slowly three times, and
got the reply 'All right.' Assistance was
sent out and everything straightened up,
and afterward it turned out that thera
had been an expert operator on ths
wrecked train. He had no instrument
with him. but had climbed a poio and cut
the wire in two. Then he had tapped off
Jthe message by using the envia of ths
wire, touching them against eacn other
to make the Dashes. A message c:in read
ily be sent in this way. but the queerest
part of it all was how he received my
message. He had held the two ends oC
the wire in his hands and close enoughs
together to keep up the current and hail
felt the little shocks of the letters. Ho
could not have taken a lor.g message that
Â¦way, but he was lonklnc for the word
'yes' and caught the three letters with
out difficulty. The young man received
a letter of thanks from the company, to
gether with $5 for his day s work."
"There was a man up north -who kept
two trains waiting nearly all night once."
began Mr. Jefferey. "Instead of giving
a lap order he left a gap open. Gave
two trains orders to wait for each other,
and Instead of giving them the same sta
tion he named two stations about tea
miles apart. The conductors could do
nothing but obey orders, so they waited
there for each other nearly all night, un
til the mistake was discovered. That was
under the old single order system. Wo
have a system now that cuts off the lia
bility of such mistakes, each order being
checked over four times by the dispatcher
and both conductors being given the ordar
at the same time."
Then they explained to me many Inter
esting things upon their charts â how mis
takes could be made and how they could
be prevented: pictured (or me the troubla
they have with Sunday picnics and excur
sions, when all their reserve trains ara
out. "Sometimes we have seven or eight
trains coming one way and three or four
going the otherâ all in a distance of thirty
miles or so. Imagine how we have to
manage to get meeting places for them
all. and to keep them all moving so as to
make as little delay as possible. The rac
ing season is a nightmareâ the same thing
âtrains all going one way. and they havo
to get back again for another trip, all on,
the same line."
Mr. Walters was explaining all this to
me between messages and sandwiches, for
he was busy and hungry. Coffee had been
made over a little gas jet. and the dis
patcher^ being used to attending to about
a dozen th!ng3 at a time, did not seem to
mind a thirteenth task, especially as
that task happened to be a dainty llttla
lunch provided ly ; a thoughtful Uttla
somebody at home.
As I came out through the office Mr.
Frazier. the superintendent, opened a biff
door and showed me the time card map, a,
great chart representing the network oC
railways, with pins sticking In at stations
to represent trains. Of course there wero
many other things which I did not see
and â¢which would take much explaining to
make Intelligible, but I had seen and un
derstood enough to marvel mightily. And,
the next time I am on a train which has
to wait an hour or so at some station,
when everybody Is saying hard things
about the conductor, with an Idea that ho
has the managing of thingsâ when pro
fanity begins to condense In the atmos
phere and every other passenger feels as
if he is being terribly abusedâ I shall feel
that I am a creature of very little Im
portance Indeed and remember that the
dispatcher up there at his little table Is
doing bis very best. NAN BYXBEE.

Then the verjr dryness of the themes lie

There is perhaps no collection In all of

this exhibit who had evidently deter

exposition systematically, to commence
at the beginning and to take In every

for this exhibit! Perhaps ha is a states

them through several rooms, when the oldl
gentleman turned to his wife with this
remark: "Well. Mary. I don't think thesa
Frenchmen have got much of a show,
but we've come to see It and I guess tÂ«'4
better keep on." I left them still looWns
at maps and diagrams and shuddered
when I thought of the miles of, such
things yet before them.
"Social Economy" reminds me of a very
devout American minister, who is at pres
ent visiting the exposition- I am not sure
whether he be Methodist or Baptist, but
anyhow, his scruples are most pronounced
and his theories most rigid. Several young
Americans were visiting the "Folles Ber
geres" a few evenlfh?3 ago. which, as
every one knows, is one of the gayest re
sorts in Paris. It is not so wicked as sorr.o
other places In this very wicked city, be
ing "possible" for one's wife, though
hardly so for one's daughter. It is pop
ular with all strangers, hut is not exactly
the place where one would expect to meet
one's ministerial friends. Accordingly
these gentlemen were duly surprised on
encountering no one less than this rever
end gentleman. "You here!" they ex
claimed in chorus. "Tes," said the minis
ter, "you see I am a student of social
ecpnomy and am here in that capacity."
And now "social economy" is becom-nc
the favorite study of these young Ameri
cans. Indeed, their devotion to It Is so
assiduous that I tremble for their endur
ance. I have not yet met them among
my maps and diagrams, but for that mat
ter neither have I met the minister.
The opening of the United States build
ing last Saturday brought out the Ameri
can colony in formidable array. Every
one was dressed In his best and a very
pwell-looking crowd was the result. Tho
plumage was distressingly crushed, how
ever, before the opening of the doors, a
set of French officers being even put In
line to keep the visitors from advancing
until the signal should be given. A threat
ening. pers.Iring. imploring and alto

the Embassador, however, but Varney
Gaskill of the California Commission, evi
dently quite unconscious of the greatness
that had been thrust upon him. No ons

We agreed that If Mr. Gaskill were not
the Embassador. he looked aa If he ought
to be. In the building, after a few
speeches, Mr. Peck arranged himself for
the bestowing of automatic hand-shakes.
When It came my turn for this honor the
gentleman was- looking over his shoulder

Che American girl has the reputation of
belrg the most independent of her sex.
but assuredly phe. docs not deserve this
repute. The English woman is the only
realty Independent female In all the world,
and the Paris Exposition is a good place
to prove it. The French woman Is mak
ing the exposition the fashion. She Is
jiatronJz'.r.g It as she patronizes the Grand
Prix or the Concours Hippique. ThÂ«
modistes are. advertising exposition

lenst attractive of the great show is tnÂ«
dress parade. The short skirt, shirt waist

ere not "comme il faut" In Paris; but all
rorts of silksâ principally the foulard,
with elaborate lace trimmings, trailing
,nkirts ar.d ostravasnr.t creations in mll
jlineryâ ha\*e rupplanted our comfortable
simplicity. Now the American girl has
an excellent chance to prove her inde
pendence, but I am finding her woefully
wanting. She is really more Parisian
than the Parisians. In almost every par
ticular che goes them one better. Her
fkirt is a little longer; her hat a little
more extreme. She is helping out with ail
her might the rather ridiculous plan of
making the exposition "fashionable." But
the English woman, does Bhe conform?
JCot In the least. Her skirt Is even a little
shorter than usual (I . suspect that It Is
lest year's cut off around the bottom);
bcr hat is a four-shilling sailer, and her
g:o\es are dark and Bubstantlal. Bhe Is
despised and laughed at by the French,
but what of It? She goes ner way. sub
limely indifferent. She is not uncon
pcious of the effect that she produces; she
is not in the least defiant, but she is sim
ply and absolutely independent. There la
yet another woman who is becoming con
spicuous at the exposition, and that is thi
fair-faced German. Germany is exerting
herself' this year to be friendly with
France. Her exhibits are unsurpassed by
anything at the exposition, and her people
are arriving in numbers. For thirty years
France has hated Germany with all tbe
ardor of her soul, but this year her an
tipathies are so strongly occupied with
England that she has nothing left for her
neighbor over the Rhine. It is not that

THE
POSTER GIRL
THE poster girl is the girl of to-day.
Whether she started the posters or
the posters starte 1 her is yet to be
discussed. At any rate, we saw
prints of her bursting; forth upon bill
boards and book coveis till of a tudden
one year, and then we looked about and
found that she was entering the thr. ter
or alighting from that carriage or walk
ing directly beside us. C-- : -
Some of the other girls can't be pos
teresque, but you can. Its absurd to see
that little dump of a Mollie affectin.: the
curves and floats of posterism, isn't it?
She is as graceful as a duck and as lithe
as a pumpkin. And as for Maudeâ 'veil,
it is . impossible unless she should train
the expression of her face to assume the
attitude of her gown. But you,, slender
and flexible and with a face that fol
lows all the quick little shifts of thought,
and hands and arms; that do likewise â
you have only to snap your fingers and
presto, you are transformed Into the pos-..
ter girl of .1900.
Occasionally one is found whe can as
sume all picturesque poses of the real
poster girl with equal ease and graceâ
such a one ia Miss Lillian Burkhart, who;
besides being a. clever actress, is also
gifted with a keen sense of the artistic.
It is- easier than you guess to make
your expression (of. face and body roth,
mind) tell a whole story in one single
â¢pose, if you only know how. But you
can't know how unless you feel how.' Per
haps that sounds more discouraging thai,
it really is. After all, we m-arly all of
us feel, and what we need .is to- teach
our personalities to tell the little . atories
that we are all the time living over in
our minds. A few years ago a man went
from, coast to coast teaching the art of
expression, and he was adored and be
fadded by some, sneered at and carica
tured by others. Both classes overdid the
matter. He was an absurd extremist,
that is true enough, so absurd that in
time he and his fluffy bang and his thumb
ring disappeared from off the 1 face of the
known earth. But what he taught about
expression has its value, and for that he
is remenbered a little even in this year.
"The â¢wistful girl," wistfulness aside,
shows as perfect a poster outline as you
willfind.' The long curves are there, the
forward tilt of the belt, the floating effect
of the skirt about the feet, are all there:
There must be a basis for these lines
In the first place, but training goes a
long Way. ' Practice standing with, the
knees back ana you will- get the proper
tilt. Once having it, be sure to keep It.
Then throw the shoulders back, the chest
forward.' Try walking with arms hanging
downward behind, hands clasped. Pretty
soon you will find your figure coming to
terms. â¢ â¢â¢.';Â¦Â¦-
Then about dress. Study the correct out
line and, follow it.- Details count for less
than your dressmaker would have you
believe; whether your belt Is stitched or
braided means so little, but that your
skirt should cling at the hips and flare
at the heels means so much.
.Beyond these few -rules you must help
yourself. Nobody can teach you to look
Â¦wtetful or earnest orâ lovable Not that
you could help it if you tried, but â Â» -o <zfi> jffHO Trill follow me to tn^ war?
VVA// 0 ' 11 have a good horse to
xjfxy ride? Who'll wear a pistol and a
sword hy h!s side? and fight-"
Here are rral war herpes, the kind you
have heard about, doing a war dance. Just
to chow how it S3 done.
The plainest thing to b<? corn is that the
horses <ire all in natural positions, show-
Ing that their work is mere play.
Pen tketches of horses in action usual
ly show a humped back and logs t:cd In
knots that cou!d never bÂ«* undone before
the animal died of cramps.
Â¦These photographs were ir.ad<? while
troopers of tho Sixth Cavalry were at
their regular morning es.ercise of jump-
Ing barricades end slicing- dowr. hill, with
all of tht arms and cccouterrr.er.i3 that
are regularly used fn actual war. The
dead weight In the way of ammunition
and other Impedimenta carried by th^pe
horses would break the heart of a regular
hurtcr cr steeplechase racer, yet they are
expected to and do keep It up all day. and
Ca.y after day, for weeks.
The cavalry horse, though, receives the
very best of care and attention.
The back of a horse is often made sore
by careless, heavy action on the part of
his rider, or by an incorrect arrangement
of the saddle blankets. There is a very
simple and easy preventive for this in
the army, which is to let the rider Walk
until the hack has a chance to heal.
Liphtncps and rapidity of action is the
chief advantage of the cavalry. To obtain
this nearly everything else is made sub
Â»Â«< virnt. The American cavalry, while
it lacks the spectacular appearance -of
European horse. Is far ahead In all of the
requirements of actual warfare. Our cav
alryir.e.i are not handicapped with nickej
plated wash basins on their heads, while
brightly dyea cowtails and gayly painted
straps dangle round themselves and their
chargers. Gewgaws are all very well en
review and certainly look very fine In pic
tures,"but fifty years of continuous Indian
fiRhtlng have taught our horsemen just
what they need In their business, and they
have that and nothing more.
The result of all of this training and
experimenting, with actual war for the
trial, has developed our cavalry in prac
tice to be a highly useful arm of the
service, while tacticians of English and
Continental armies have been gradually
coming to believe that the Improvement
in small arms had made cavalry. a thing
of the past â a decaying- branch of the mil
itary tree.
The American cavalry is planned on a
different line from that of any other civ
ilized nation. '
The horsemen of other armies are lineal
descendants of the old knight, in armor
who weighted himself and his horse with
sheetiron until- mobility was out of the
question. Over this armor" were waving
ribbons and blazoned designs, so that In
a chance medley friends might know
whom the visor concealed. - â¢
The ribbons and the paint are still re
tained on the Continent and that was why
the military, v/riters said that the cavalry
was an expiring arm of the service.
Our troopers have modeled on different
lines.
The Indian, mounted naked upon his
bare-backed pony, circling round and
round his prey like the soaring hawk, tire
less /as* the wind because unfrelghted and
unhampered; that is the model which the
American has had before him, and neces
sity has compelled that the Indian be met
by a man on an equal footing.
The rough riders have' been assumed to
bVa type more skilled; in American rid
ing than the regular cavalry.
But one cannot see the Presidio troopers
at their drill without feeling that as far
as the yellow "trimmed- warriors go the
army is not hampered by any restraining
dignity.
The school of riding in use Dy tne troop
er Is distinctly Mexican. The horse Is in
the first place free from superfluous
trappings. He is ' taught to be guided
merely by the touch of the rein on the
side of. his neck. There is but one pair
of reins and these again are held in one
hand. ;'_Â¦'-;
This Is a strong contrast when compared
with the cumbrous lines, snaffles, martin
gales, checks and other steering machin
ery from; which the European has to dis
entangle himself when emerging from a
hotly mixed cavalry charge.
The Boers have had no military train
ing except of actual practice and their
methods correspond very closely to ours.
There is no doubt that. when the war is
ended and their true stories come out,
thera will be some of the most wonder-
nil tales of endurance and execution that
have ever been given the world, with the
exception perhaps of the feats performed
by the band under Colonel Mosby.
Our own cavalry In the Philippines has
had a splendid effect in impressing the
natives; with the power of the army.
The size of the horses is. of course, as
tonishing to them, for theirs are like all
Island Horses, very much undersized.
But if Is the leaping of the horses over
their barricades that most astonishes the
Filipinos, and when the tales of the won
derful leaps and the effects of the dis
charge of weapons are repeated from
mouth to mouth It is not long before it
becomes a wonderful epic of flying mon
sters, spitting fiery death upon all before
them.
That is why the bolo men run. So
much for our troopers in the Philippines.
The cavalry Is a long way from the end
of its work. There is now every prospect
that America may yet be compelled to
act on the defensive In China and there
Is no doubt about tne way tnat the Chin
ese will flee; from cavalry.
They ride a littlo themselves, but only*
on cows, which are far from making:
horsemen of them.
The cavalry man leads the finest life In
the world in hi3 own opinion and none can
know better than he.
While every other being Is complaining
of his hard fate, the cavalryman dashes
about over the world, mounted on the
tost horse that money can buy: a Ufa
lone salary, with a pension at the end for
his family; all that he wants to eat and
wear and the glory of being a defender of
his country. All of that, but best of all,
health,- that Is the cavalry man's happy
lot. Â¦
Artificial sponges are now made In Ger
many from a mixture of pure cellulose
with zinc chloride and sodium chloride.
These sponges will absorb wa'ter in the
same way a3 the genuine article, and
when allowed to dry they become just aj
tirra in substance.

I of the foreign legations at Peking, and points cut that telegraphic communications with Peking are cut and news
' * should be taken with prudence.
LONDON. June 17. 4 a. m.-*There is no confirmation of the reported destruction of the legations In Peking and the
killing of the German Minister, Baron von Ketteler. nor the later report of fighting between the British and the Chinese.
Dispatches from Shanghai, dated last evening, state that Admiral Seymour's force Is in a tight place between Lang Fang
and Yung Sun, with enormous masses of soldiers in front, while the Boxers, with more soldiery, are cutting the railway ia
the rear. The Kiang Nan arsenal, outside of Shanghai, is sending vast quantities of ammunition north. All Is <juiet at
Shanghai, but trade has been disrupted. It is stated that 7000 Americans are coming from Manila and that large forces of
Japanese are also en route. The wires south of Tientsin have been cut and the ciity telegraphically Isolated.
According to a special from Vienna it is stated in diplomatic circles there that the Question cf iaterrention ia under dis
cussion by the powers. It is proposed that Japan shall act as mandatory of the powers and re-establish order in Peking
and elsewhere. This, it is said, emanates from England and 13 supported by Germany and Austria, but it Is doubtful if
Russia and France will agree to the proposition. St. Petersburg reports that cemmunlcatlon berwen Kal Gaa aid Peking has

NEW YORK, June 17.â A dispatch received in New
York last night from Hongkong states that all
the foreign legations in Peking had been de
stroyed, and that Baron von Ketteler, German Minis
ter to China, had been killed. Up to 3 o'clock this
morning neither denial nor confirmation of these re
ports had been received, but stress is laid upon the
possibility that they are merely more or less specific
amplification of the rumors current in Shanghai nine
days ago.
It is to be noted that the special dispatch from The
Call and Herald's correspondent at Hongkong report
ing the departure of the British cruiser Terrible for
Taku to-day adds that many rumors were current but
makes no mention of the destruction of the legations
and the murder of the German /Minister. Late cables
Vrom Shanghai also have no reference to the earlier
Hongrcoi"Â«Â£; story.
L^rlin linds it difficult to credit the report. Never
theless an official note to the effect that no confirma
tion had been received has not tranquilized the public
mind, particularly in view of the dispatches received
in the German capital from Tientsin stating that the
Boxers entered Peking on June 13 and attacked the le
gations, beinÂ£ repulsed with the aid of Maxims. '
Sheridan P. Read, former United States Consul at
Tientsin, who knows the Chinese capital well, points
out in an interview that the foreign legations, with
the exception of the British, might be easily attacked
with success owing to their position under the wall of
Peking.
In Washington there was an evident fear that the
Â£ilarrninÂ£ reports mi^ht prove to be only too true.
How serious the Chinese situation generally is consid
ered to be by the authorities there is evidenced by the
decision that in case Admiral Kemp?? is not heard
from within twenty-four hours to instruct General
MacArthur to send troops from the Philippines.
j^\ ALL HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL,
(.WASHINGTON, June 16. â Official and diplomatic
Washington is in a ferment over the Chinese crisis. The
report from Hongkong this morning that the German Minister
at Peking had been killed and the legations burned grew by
night to proportions of the massacre of all foreigners in the
Chinese capital. Unable to reach either Minister Conger or
Admiral Kempff, and failing to obtain confirmation or denial ot
the report from the embassies, the authorities fear there may be
some ground for the rumor, especiallv since the British Embas
sador received last night a dispatch irom Tientsin stating that a
rumor was current there, seemingly well authenticated, that the
Boxers at Peking planned to attempt to destroy the foreign lega
tions to-day. Just how Tientsin was able to get such news from
Peking no one seems able to explain, and Minister Wu. the Chi
nese representative, seized upon the absence of communication
between the two cities as evidence of the falsity of the report. It
is suggested also that if an attack were made on the German le
gation, the French legation, which adjoins it, would iikewise
have been an object of assault.
TROOPS MflY BE SENT F^OM PHILIPPINES.
Whether the rumors be true or false, the administration has
concluded that it would be unwise to wait longer before taking
determined measures for the protection of Americans and their
interests in China. Secretary Hay discussed the situation with
the President this morning, and it was stated afterward that un
less the President should receive a dispatch from Minister Con
ger or Admiral Kempff within twenty-four hours General Mac-
Arthur would probably be ordered to forward troops from Ma
nilla-
This determination has been reached with reluctance. Ad
miral Kempff was asked if he needed troops or ships. The dis
patch was probably delivered, but now that the wires are cut the
answer will have to be taken by a vessel to Port Arthur, whence
it can be wired across Siberia. As the distance between Taku
and Port Arthur is only 200 miles, it is thought the dispatch
can be filed at that point to-night or to-morrow morning, and
will reach here by afternoon.
There is a strong feeling among officials that -in the interest
of protection of Americans all over the Celestial Empire a large
force should be sent to Peking, the United States taking the lead
in compelling the Chinese Government to suppress the Boxers
and protect foreign life and property. In discussing the crisis to

strong force of marines been sent to Peking at the beginning of
the trouble, and had the powers unitedly demanded the supDres-
LOVDOV June 16.â A special dispatch from Shanghai, dated to-day, says it Is
reported that after the audience of Sir Claude Macdonald, British Minister
to China with the Tsung -11 Yamen fire foreign Ministers demanded a safe
conduct for their servants and their. people, notifying" the Tsung h Yamen
that they could no longer maintain relations with the Government. The an
Â«wer was "Certainly not. "What other answer could be expected in a civ
ilized country?" This was 'followed' by an increase of the forces around the gates,
and the next night widespread incendiarism. â¢
This incendiarism prevailed among the foreign residences. The massacre ot
native Christians and other friends of foreigners was also common. The building
of the \merican mission, the customs, the mess quarters and a number of other
structures were destroyed. The guard alone saved the foreigners, who. it is stated,
are huddled in legations, very short of food and deserted by native servants.
I-ate Chinese reports state that the Empress has ordered Liu Kung Yih, Chang
Chi Tung and LI Hung Chang to hasten to Peking. They will probably find an
excuse for declining. The latest edict against the rioters especially avoids men
tioning the Boxers. ',â¢Â«"â¢' Z
Berlin and St. Petersburg dispatches assert that Russia and Germany have
combined for common action in China. It is reported that a high Russion person
age is going to Berlin to arrange details.
Dispatches from Tientsin say- that the Boxers entered Peking on the evening
of June 13. destroyed several missions and attacked the legations, but were re
pulsed with the aid of Maxims. No Europeans were reported killed. The atti
tude of the Chinese troops toward the Boxers was uncertain.

There is reason to believe that the powers are consulting
among themselves as to the character of intervention necessary
to end the disturbances. The President, nevertheless, is disposed

[Yet, as an official pointed out, this Government is to. all in-
The administration, however, will proceed cautiously. In
the State Department it is held that everything was done in the
beginning to protect Americans and their property, while at the
same time pursuing the historic policy of this Government of
preserving independence of action. It was thought marines
and sailors would be sufficient, but if it is found they are not,
then General MacArthur's forces will be promptly drawn upon.
The War Department is averse to sending troops from Luzon,
inasmuch as any substantial decrease of the , force may cause a
fresh outbreak in the Philippines, and also because the offi
cials doubt if the President has authority to order troops to in
vade China when war does not actually exist. Some even assert
that Congress must be called into extra session to give the
President such authority. The State Department authorities,
however, say the troogs will go to China simply to guard Amer
ican life and property, and such action is not an act of war, but
of a police character.

CHINESE IMPERIAL
TROOPS JOIN BOXERS
WASHINGTON, June 16.â It is said that
the oneratlons of the Boxers are rolling
up a heavy bill of damages against the
Chinese Government and that this will be
made the subject of a strong demand for
indemnity by the United States as soon
as order is restored In China. It is held
that under the terms of our treaty with
China, not only are American mission
aries entitled Â» to ' the protection of the
Chinese Government, but even their na
tive converts.' to the doctrine
that we have laid down in the case of
Turkish missionary claims, the Chinese
Government^ can be held responsible for
outrages committed against American
citizens, even in times of rioting. If the
Government troops, its agents, fail to re
spohd to a call or participate themselves
in the rioting. This is said to be the case
with the Boxers disturbances. - The par
ticular treaty provision covering the cases
of the American missionaries- and their
native converts is unique. It ls contained
in article 29 of the treaty of 1858 and is as
follows:.
. "The practice of the Christian religion,
as professed by the Protestant and
Roman Catholic churches, is recognized
as teaching them to do good and to do to
others as they would they should do unto
them. Hereafter those who quietly pro
fess and teach these doctrines shall not
be harassed or persecuted on account of
their faith. Any person, whether citizen
of the United States or Chinese convert,
who, according to these tenets, peaceably
teaches and practices -the principles of
Christianity shall in no case be interfere!}
with or molested."
It Is learned in authoritative quarters
that the negotiations relative to the
Chinese crisis have led to a discussion of
a larger subject of so adjusting and har
monizing the action of the several powers
interested as to maintain complete
equilibrium and assure the continued
peace of the world. The French authori
ties have been particularly active in urg
ing that one of the requislties of any ac
tion was to see that it tended toward
maintaining the balance between those in
terested In the East, and there is reason
to believe the representations have had
considerable influence in keeping any one
of the several nations from putting a pre
ponderating military force in China, a
course that would open the way to a gen
eral international disturbance.

BERLIN. June If..â The correspondent
here of the Associated Press saw the Chi
nese Embassador at Berlin to-day.
Through an interpreter hÂ» saifi:
"I have had no news whatever from the
Chinese Government about the Boxers'
rebellion. The Boxers are a mere rabble,
robbers, thieves and rascals. There arÂ«
no scholars, mandarins or officials among
them. The reports that the Chinese sol
diers have attacked the international
forces cannot possibly be true. The Em
press opposes the Boxers, and the troops
could not act against h>r. The Boxers
will soon be suppressed. They -would have
been suppressed by the Chinese troops
without landing the International forces.
The embassies could have been protected
by guards of Chinese if the Embassadors
had as ked for them."
The latest official German news from
Tientsin, dated the 15th. is viewed at the
Foreign Office us corroborative of the re
ports that the situation has intensiiied
durir.g the week. The Fbretgn Ortice con
tinues to believe that the Chinese Govern
ment makes common cause with the Box
ers and does not believe the Government
troops attacked the international forces,
as "that would be too crazy a venture."
The intention had beÂ«n to close the ses
elon of both houses of the Prussian Uiet
to-day, but owing to the amazing revolt
against the Government which has broken
out in the House of Lords, which usually
works in full accord with the Government,
this has now become impossible.
Under the leadership of Baron von Lcve
below, who is a former Reichstag presi
dent, the Lords pave the Government a
distinct vote of distrust in the matter of
regulating the Silesia rivers, where territic
floods axe customary.
In the lower house the Uberals under
Dr. Barth tried mild obstruction tactics
against the passage of the department
Â«tore bill. The later will rome up again
on Monday, but it is unquestionable
whether the bill will pass now until the
obstruction tactics cease. However, it ls
certain that the Diet will adjourn during
the coming week.
Recently the lower employes of the
Prussian railroads, although State offl
ciaJs. have shown an inclination to af
filiate with the Socialist party, and have
evinced in every way dissatisfaction with
their present salaries and conditions. The

GERMANY HAS
LITTLE FAITH IN
THE DOWAGER
Copyrighted. 1900. by the Associated Press.
LONDON. June 10.â The serious condi
tion of affairs in China is daily becoming
the mo3t absorbing topic in Great Brit
ain. In view of the general public's con
cern and the dispatches from China It is
rather remarkable to learn that the Box
ers appear to have but little affected the
great volume of business between China
and England. The largest houses In Lon
ilon trading with the Far East, corpora
tions, insurance companies, banks and
merchants, are fairly unanimous in saying
their operations are not interfered with.
However this section of the business
world and those whose capital they repre
sent are naturally awaiting the outcome
of the crisis with anxiety. They are ap
jarcnlly more disturbed over the possi
bility of the powers falling out among
themselves after the Boxers receive their
quietus than over the amount of damage
the Boxers will wreak prior to that event.
It is dawning on Great Britain that un
less the political crisis at the Cape is
tactfully and successfully handled the
paciiication of South Africa may be In
definitely delayed. The putting down of
a possible anti-British agitation in a Brit
ish colony, similar to that which has ex
isted for a century in Ireland, but without
the physical force element, is recognized
as being a fur more serious task than
outflanking and disarming the Boers.
A prominent Free Stater, with British
sympathies, but with many relatives on
the liovr and bond side, said to the rep
resentative of the Associated Press that
be believed the bond party would break
out into armed revolt to-day were riiles
bo easily obtained as they were before
the commencement of the war. He has
oniy just come to England from the Cape,
and though opposed to the bondltes, is
respected and trusted by them.
The gravity of the issues depending on
a solution of the situation caused by Mr.
Schreiuer's resignation of the Premiership
of Cape Colony can be better gauged by
this Free Stater's candid opinion than by
any cer.sortd statement from Cape Town.
The English papers devote many edi
torials to the question. Those which are
inspired show no desire to have Sir John
Gordon Spriggr in sole power and Mr.
Schreiner in the opposition ranks, for,
apart from the fact that it is doubtful if
he can maintain his majority, the opinion
prevails at the Colonial Office and is ex
pressed by almost everybody coming from
the Cape, regardless of political faith, that
Spripg is utterly unfitted in point of abil
ity to steer the colony out of the present
crisis.
July will witness a pan-American con
ference in London, .with the object of se
curing increased recognition of the rights
of Great Britain's colored subjects. The
idea originate'! with H. S. Williams, a
native of Trinidad, whose appear met with
enthusiastic response, and Southwest
Africa, the West Indies, Abyssinia, and it
is said, the United States, will send repre
sentatives with the view of looking after
the general interests of the colored race.
The demands will include a thorough sys
tem of education and representation and
peasant proprietorship, with especial ref
erence to South Africa and the West
Indies.
The resumption of Parliament after the
Whitsuntide Â»â¢â¢ â¢*â¢-- not marked by
any noticeable features.
On all sides the death of Mrs. Gladstone
hap called forth genuine expressions of
sympathy and admiration, such as would
scarcely have been written about any
other woman in the kingdom. The trend
of them is that she was the ideal wife.
Her coffin is exactly similar to Mr. Glad
stone's. Both the prjvate services at Ha
warden and the public ceremony at West
minster will be as simple as possible, in
accordance with her own ideas and those
of the great commoner. Though their
grandson comes into possession of Hawar
den it will remain a kind of family house.
Herbert Gladstone and his sisters being as
free to come and go as they were during
the lifetime of their parents. The young
master of Hawarden, who is not yet of
ape, is a pleasant, merry-looking youth,
who will leave Eton this year and then go
to Oxford.
BUSINESS IS
NOT AFFECTED BY
RIOTS IN CHINA
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
PARIS, June 16.â News of fighting be
tween the European troops and the Box
ers has enhanced the interest in the situ
ation in China, which is forming the lead
ing feature of all the newspapers. ' The
diplomatic world is naturally very much
stirred, especially owing to the contra
dictory reports regarding the attitude
taken by the Empress Dowager.
Even the Japanese and Chinese legations
appear doubtful as to the exact condition
of affairs. At the Chinese legation much
uneasiness prevails. The explanation
given by the officers there is that the
Boxers are simply outlaws, who receive
no countenance from the Government and
are ill treating their own countrymen as
well as foreigners.
. Members of the legation, whose con
stant intercourse with Europeans has
brought them more into line with Western
ideas, admit guardedly that the general
situation in China is hardly satisfactory
and that there ls room there for beneficial
reforms, but they are far from pleased at
the recent developments which have given
Russia an oportunity to play what prob
ably will eventually become a predominat
ing part in the much-feared intervention.
The Japanese Minister, Kato Takaskl,
on being interviewed, said he had not j'et
received instructions from his country
regarding action to be taken here, but he
had every reason to believe Japan would
act in concert with the other powers,
which course. In his opinion, was the
surest method of bringing about prompt
and durable tranquillity.
Isolated action on the part of one or
more of the powers, he says, will only
produce chaos and will be likely to lead to
trouble between the powers themselves.
A man who ie entitled to Â«peak with au
thority in Chinese matters, Gabrielle Le
Marier, for eight years French Minister
at Peking, expresses a pessimistic feel
ing regarding the extension of the antl
forrign movement.
"For European?." pays Le Marier, "the
!>rcsent crisis is the gravest that has yet
occurred."
ANXIETY OVER
SITUATION IN
TIE FAR EAST
MINNEAPOLIS, June 16.â A special to
the Times from Seattle says: According
to advices from Nortons Bay, four of a
party of flve men have been murdered
and the fifth is wandering in the wilder
ness demented or fallen a prey to savages
or wild beasts. The party consisted of
Oliver Woodruff Scott of Tacoma, Dr. A.
A. Keyser of Minneapolis, W. W. Wright
of San Francisco, T. B. Haines of San
Francisco and George Beckholdt, also said
to \ie from Minneapolis.
The men, while working an old Russian
placer digging, as gleaned from a diary
found on the body of Scott, found gold in
abundance and the sight drove them out
of their heads.
Then the story of murder began. Keyser
was the first victim. He had been stabbed
while asleep. Wright was suspected, and,
shouldering his gun, left camp. A few
hours later Beckholdt was shot in the
back while talking with his companions.
Scott and Haines pursued Wright for two
days and captured him, but Haines was
wounded and Wright was shot fatally
and died two days later.
On May 15 Scott's body was found fifty
miles from the mouth of the Ungatulik
River, which Hows into Nortons Bay. He
had been murdered. As Haines, the sole
Â«urvlvor, had not been seen in any of the
settlements it is believe-d he perished In
his wanderings in the forest.
The story of the murders was taken to
Ungatulik and a party headed by Herbert
Murray ls now endeavoring to locate the
rich Russian diggings which the party
located.
Pretty precise directions were found in
Scott's notebook and they anticipate no
difficulty in finding the ground.

cheering, but when it was known that
they had brought the usual cargo of fruit,
and wine the enthusiasm was boundless.
"They have brought peaches and plums
to seduce delegates for Scott," was heard
on all sides.
The Californians soon after their arrival
held a closed session in parlor "A" of the
Colonnade. The Scott boom was dis
cussed after the session. The various
members at first wcie reticent, but finally
admitted that . there would be no
formal acknowledgment of Scott's candi
dacy, if candidacy it may be called. But
all tho delegates united in protesting that
up to date they had heard nothing from
Mr. Scott and that they had no means of
knowing whether he wanted to be Vice
President.
"We did not hear anything about Mr.
Scott or his boom until we got here," de
clared each and every delegate, Including
Mr. Knight.
'One delegate paid' ft sprung up in the
East. Another averred that it sprung up
in one night, while a facetious party de
clared it lirst grew up like Topsy.
But, despite this inclination among
members of the California delegation to
belittle Mr. Scott's candidacy, it is re
garded mere seriously by delegates from
other States, and if it should come to a
show-down between two candidates, Mr.
Scott might possibly be a compromise
nominee, provided the California delega
tion would unite and work for him. But
they declare they will make no formal in
dorsement until Scott and the California
people request it. Colonel Knight said:
"You may say that we will indorse no
Californlan until we feel that a close con
test for Vice President would give us a
fighting chance, but we will surely sup
port some Western man for Vice Presi
dent."
Colonel Knight is evidently fearful that
delegates would be averse to nominating
Scott on account of the disaffection of la
boring men, for it has been noised around
that strikes In the Union Iron Works in
former years would certainly array labor
ing people against the president of that
Institution.
The California delegation reached Pitts
burg in time to read an account in the
Pittsburg papers of themselves and their
awful escape from death in a railroad col
lision. Their number was reported at 400

to a degree.

HANNA-PLATT FEUD
CAUSES COMPLICATIONS
Neither Cares to Support the
Vice Presidential Candidate
of the Other.
PHILADELPHIA, June IS.â If it were
not for the uncertainty over the Vice
Presidency there would be absolutely
nothing to relieve the monotony of the
Republican gathering In Philadelphia.
During the day the Vice Presidential ques.
tion seemed to revolve around New York.
The position of the State, with four men
available for candidates, the feeling In
some that political considerations should
give the second place on the ticket to the
Er/ipire State and the somewhat strained
relations between Senator Hanna and
Senator Platt Â£ll serve to turn attention
to New York.
To-night the situation in New York is
Just this: They want the Vice Presidency.
Senator Platt does not want Bliss, be
cause he believes his selection would be
a victory for Hanna in New York. But
Hanna does not want Odell. because It
would be an absolute surrender to Platt.
Neither wants Woodruff. Platt Is not
fully determined about Odell, and the del
egation may finally get around to the pre
sentation of General Francis Green.
The friends of the other candidates have
not been inactive. The hardest kind of
work is being done for Representative
Dolliver, the Iowa candidate, who arrived
this afternoon. The Iowa delegation Is
here and is resolved to present Dolliver's
name, Lafayette Young, editor of the Des
Moines Capital, having been selected to
make the nominating speech. Mr. Dol
liver is not talking. lie says that his
poFition is such that It does not justify
him in saying anything further than that
he Is gratified at the cordiality with which
his friends assure him of their support.
Mr. Burton, who heads the Kinsas dele
gation, says that the suggest ,vn of Dol
liver has been *vell received in that State.
Bliss talk continues in spite of the re
peated assertions of Mr. Bliss himself,
supplemented by the statement of Senator
Hanna, that he would no longer be con
sidered as a candidate. Mr. Bliss himself
arrived to-day and said that there was
nothing to add to what he has said be
Â»Â¦ There has not been much said about
Senator Fairbanks to-day, though there
is still a possibility that he will be named.
The Pacific Coast is determined to make
Itself heard in the convention. California
and the mountain States are keeping the
name of Irving M. Scott, "the builder of
the Oregon," before, the people, while the
Mr. Hawiey will be chosen to represent
Texas on the national committee.
The Delaware controversy between the
Addtcki ar.d Dupont factions was tem
porarily shelved by the committee. Mr.
Duponfs followers were found to bo un
willing to make such concessions as the
committee could accept, and the commit
tee decided there- was no course open to
it which would insure the State to the
Republican party at the fall election ex
cept to cxcludo both faction? from par
ticipation in the early procc-edinps of the
convention. Tiiis disposition will have
the effect of throwing the adjustment of
the case upon the National Convention's
committee on credentials.
Just before adjournment for the day the
committee disposed of Mr. Payne's reso
lution rf-garding the participation of Fed
eral officeholders in the selection of dele
gates by referring them all to Chairman
Hanna. It is believed by Mr. Payne that
the effect of ihis disposition of the reso
lution will bo to hold it over the heads of
offenders in the future, and that it would
thus have a boneticial influence, even
though it was not acted upon by the com
mittee.
Mr. Ticpko of Rhode Island offered a
resolution during the afternoon for a re
duction of representation In Congress of
States where the free exercise of the
elective franchise is prevented. It was
debated at some length, but was tabled
because of the generally expreFsec! opin
ion that the subject was for the action of
the National Convention, and not for the
committee. It is understood that Mr.
Tiepke will ask the committee on resolu
tions to consider the wisdom of incor
porating the resolution in the convention
platform. A resolution looking to the re
duction of the representation of non-Re
publiean Statos in Republican conventions
was also presented, but it w;is withdrawn
after tho adverse action taken on the
Tiepke proposition.
TEMPORARY OFFICERS
OF THE CONVENTION
PHILADELPHIA, June 1Câ The feat
ure of the situation which con
fronts the Republican hosts at ihe
clos<? of the week preceding the as
sembling of the convention Is the
absolute, unanimous disposition to carry
out fully the wishes of the President In
everything relating to the â¢jomin;? con
tention. Af the clans from every quarter
of ihe country gather, the overwhelming
sentiment is that, having served ona good
term. McKinley deserves another, tnd
that good faith and good policies demand
that the wishes of the candidate, as near
ly as they can be ascertained, shall be
ri 1 â¢ â¢ ted In the matter of the Vice Presl
dency as well as of the platXfrnn upon
which he is to go to the country.
The national committee completed its
labors In connection with the contests to
cl.;y by leaving the Delaware factions sus
pended in midair.
The Vice Presidency is the uppermost
topic in the minds of the leaders as wtll
aa :!;>:â¢ rank and tile, it is the only bone
of contention and that contention would
cease very quickly it anybody were au
thorized to say exactly what the Presi
dent wants, if there is any pienipoten
tlary ot -Me President here he has not
$ tt jirtsonted his credentials. The men
v. r..> ixre popularly supposed to be McKin
ley's spokesmen are the most careful to
.. '..Â¦Am any power of attorney and their
reticence in proclaiming a candidate leads
;..Â¦> ranK and. file to believe that the Pres
. Bl has declared "hands off." The re-
BUlt is that anybody and everybody who #
has a candidate feels at liberty to boom
him to his heart's content, lor the time
being at least. Klther iiiiss or Allison
would be tne Jirst choice of a. majority of
the leaders, but both of these men have
turned deaf tars t^Â» the supplications of
the managers. Secretary Long of Mas
sachusetts they are holding in reserve 111
case another not eo acceptable' as he
should become too formidable.
Hew York Wants the Place.
The most diflicult problem arises in con-
Ziecticn with ttie New York deieg.uion.
Headed by the "Big Four"â Platt. itoose
veit. Depew and Odellâ the Empire State's
elite delegations came to town to-day and
set the eossijJB mad with speculation. To
New York, the logicians argued, the nom
ination naturally should go to secure a
Tvell-balanced ticket geographically, and
if New York should present a candidate.
Bolidly backed, unless the candidate were
acceptable there might -be trouble ahead
for the mantcers.
Lieutenant Governor Timothy Woodruff.
Already on the ground witn headquarters
opened and buttons engraved, has never
been considered seriously, but the possi
bility that the New York delegation might
get together on Odell or General Greene
or Bliss, if the latter gentleman could be
induced to change his mind at the elev
enth hoar, mii-kes the political prophets
pause. Go-v-ernor Roosevelt still firmly ad
neres to his determination not to be a
candidate, notwithstanding his wonderful
hold on the imaginations of ail. Until
New York finally acts at the meeting: of
this delegation on Monday, unless the sit
uation should crystallize meantime, proph
ecies are valueless.
In the interim the West will go on
shouting ittelf hoarse. She has Irving M.
Scott ol California, the builder of the Ore
gon; Bartlett Tripp of South Dakota,
Fairbanks of Indiana and others in addi
tion to the eloquent Dolliver. None ex
cept the latter have arrived. To-morrow,
with marching cfubs and brass bands,
they will invade the monotony of Phila
delphia's Quaker Sabbath and make the
â¢wefkln ring with their vociferations in
true Western style.
And to-morrow, for the first time, Phil
adelphia will take on tne appearance of
a convention city. Receptions and ban
quets are being tendered to distinguished
visitors, but the most important gather
ing- is at the Union League Club, where
Chairman Hanna and Secretary Root are
dining.
Secretary' Root and Postmaster General
Smith, fresh from Washington, arrived
late this afternoon. "The Postmaster Gen
eral, it is understood, was the bearer of
the draft cf a platform that meets the
President's approval.
COMMITTEE DECIDES
CONTESTS OVER SEATS
Delaware Case "Lett for the Conven
tion to Take Final Action
Upon.
PHILADELPHIA. June 16.â The Repub
lican National Committee was in session
from 11 a. m. until almost 7 p. m. to-day.
A number of subjects were disposed of,
and when the committee adjourned all the
contests over sr-ats in the convention, ex
cept those from the State of Alabama,
}.^<i been put It.
The Alabama case has been revived
upon an agreement between the two fac
tions to divide the delegation by elimin
ating contesting delegates, and this work
v.-jil be completed at a meeting of the com
mitu-e to be held next Monday. In three
districts of the State a settlement was
r*-Â«rhed towlay. but there are still several
<>th<-r districts and the State at large to
receive attention.
Other contests disposed of during the
day vrcre those covering the State of
T*-xas and several of the -districts of that
ftate. as well as the Norfolk district In
Virginia and Committeeman "Jim" Hill's
old district In Mississippi. In Hill's dis
trict one delegate of each faction was
seated, while in the Virginia district
former Congressman Bowden carried off
the honors in opposition to John S. Wise.
Congressman Hawiey won the fight for
delegate at large from Texas in opposition
to E. H. A. Green. Some of the district
df-l^gat ions* were given to the Green fac
tion, but the Ilawlcy people claim that,
taking the delegation as It stands, they
Lave a majority. This plan means that
His Vice Presidential Boom Punc
turad by the Delegation From
His Own State.
Special IvM.-patch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. June 16â The Scott
boom has been punctured. The arrival o'f
the California delegation was awaited
with expectancy by politicians and news
paper men alike*, for all were anxious to
hear about the "Irving- M. Scott boom,"
as it has been called. The interview
George A. Knight and Representative
Waters of Ims Angeles had with PresN
dent- McKinley and Senator Hanna in
Washington was supposed to have bctn
practically- an indorsement of Mr.' Scott
for Vice President. The Eastern news
papers published glowing eulogies of the
Oregon's builder.
Some said that Mr. Knight had trav
eled in advance of his colleagues in order
to put a llea in the. President's ear and
give Mr. Scott a good send off before the
delegation arrived on the ground. ,IndeeG,
Mr. Knight was clubbed "the advance
agent of Scott's boom."
So when the delegation alighted from
the train to-night and paraded up Chest
nut street, with martial music and flying
banners, the Californians were the center
of attraction. They marched past their
hotel (the Colonnade), then counter
marched, followed by great crowds of
cheering Phlladclphfans. The mere fact
that they had come all the way from Cali
fornia was enough to excite enthusiastic
Dr, Chester A. Rowell was designated
for the committee on platform, R. D.
Robbins for the committee on order of
business. George \V. Reed for the com
mittee on credentials and JV. W. Garland
for the committee on notification of the
President.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. June 16.â Boosevelt
leads all other possible candidates for the
Vice Presidency, according to a careful
poll made of the preferences of delegates
to the national convention." All delegates
who were doubtful or non-committal were
thrown out. Of 918 delegates to the con
vention, conclusive replies were received
from 472. Nearly a hundred said they
would cast their votes In accordance with
the wishes of their leaders.
The replies were thus divided: Roose
velt 45. Woodruff 43. Long 28. Fairbanks
20, Dolliver 15, former Governor Bradley
15, Bliss 8. "Wolcott 7. Charles Emery
Smith 3 and Senator Manderson of Ne
braska 2.
This list accounts for 186 delegates, and
in each vote of possible candidates the
home State was not counted, with the
exception of Fairbanks, 5 of whose 20
votes are from Indiana, and Bradley, for
whom Kentucky east 9 of his 15 votes.
It was declared by one of Governor
Roosevelt's friends who talked with him
to-night that if the Governor should be
nominated for Vice President he would
decline and take the risk of being retired
to private life. My informant said this
could not be stated too positively. Sen
ator Platt and his friends, however, do
not understand that the Governor has
made up his mind to refuse if he be nom
inated. -**,.

Special Dispatch to The Call..
PHILADELPHIA. June 16.â The follow
ing editorial from the Evening Teleprram.
is u good summary of the Vice Presi
dential situation:
Cornelius N. Wifs is not a candidate because
Thomas C. Plctt has no time for him. Because
1'latt has no time for him the New York dele
gation as a body Is against him and he can
not be advanced as "the favorite son" of the
Empire StKte. It Is to be observed, also, that
Senator Matthew Stanley Quay is saying: that
Congressman Dolllver seems to be the expedi
ent one of the situation. Mr. Quay Is not
doing anything to annoy and worry Platt, and
his dlseoveiy of the virtues of the young Iowan
Indicate, If they Indicate anything, that If Mr.
Platt cannot have Just the man of his choice
from New York the seventy-two votes of that
State and the Â«lxty-four votes of Pennsylvania
will be thrown to a candidate from the West
who Is regarded by Mr. Hanna as not quite
ripe enoush for the responsibilities of the hour.
With Roosevelt and Bliss out of the field.
New Ycrk has no candidate that will get far
ther than a complimentary vote. The flowered
vest campaign is picturesque and noisy, but
there is a disposition to regard it in the light
of an after-dinner joke. The position of Sec
retary Long hence takes on new dignity and
force, but has the weakness of directly influ
encing no doubtful State. As matters stand,
Mr. Long's candidacy is the only highly reput
able one in the East.
Now who Is th# Lochinvar to come out of
the West?

WASHINGTON. June 16.â President Mc-
Kinley Is watching developments in Phila
delphia with the keenest Interest. He is
In constant communication with Republi
can leaders by telegraph and telephone,
and will be until the convention comes to
a close.
The war room at the White House has
been converted into a campaign room and
Its wire:-', tnppinB all sections of the
country, will bring the President news
of developments in the campaign as long
as he r'emains in Washington.
Before the departure of Senator Hanna
and other leaders from Washington the
programme to be followed was carefully
mapped out. and it is the expectation of
the President that it will not be deviated
from. It Is the desire of the Presided to
refrain from appearing to dictate what
the convention shall or shall not do. and
his hand will be shown only by the policy
pursued by the leaders. He proposes to
remain in Washington until after the con
vention has adjourned, and when he has
KOt the business " of the Government in
such shape that he can safely leave the
city he will go to Canton, where he will
remain a month. He has abandoned the
trip he proposed last winter to take to the
Pacific Coast, fearing it mipht be con
strued as a stumping tour. It is under
stood that after ho leaves Canton he will
return to Washington. It is possible he
may go to Maine the latter part of the
summer, but this is problematical.
Oregon and Washington men have not
abated their Interest in the candidacy of
Bartlett Tripp.

KANSAS CITY. June 16.-C. A. Walsh,
secretary of the Democratic National
Committee, left to-night for Chicago to
complete some unfinished work In the
headquarters before finally opening his
permanent headquarters in Kansas City.
Mr. Walsh will return to Kansas City on
the 20th, remaining here until after the
convention shall have finished its work.
John I. Martin, sergeant at arms, has al
leady opened permanent headquarters
here.
It developed to-day that considerable
friction was displayed at yesterday's
meeting of the sub-committee, when the
local managers requested 3500 admission
tickets' for Kansas City. Hon. James K.
Jones, chairman of the National Commit
tee, said that he did not think Kansas
City was entitled to any tickets. The
honor of securing the convention, he
thought, should be sufficient. J. G. John
son, National Committeeman from Kan
sas, took the same view of the matter.
This was a thunderbolt to the Kansas
Cltvans, who entered a vigorous protest.
They had, they declared, expended about
$150,000 directly in preparing for the con
vention and the committee proposed to
violate all precedents by cutting the
convention city oft entirely. Finally,
as a compromise, the sub-committee or
fered the Kansas City committee 800 tick
ets. This was Immediately declined, the
local commltee saying it would be better
off with no tickets than with :Â«Â» small a
number. . * Vv '.- 1 '
It iÂ£ stated to-da.y that the local com
mittee will Insist upon having at least
3000, and that under no circumstances
will it accept the S00 offered.

WASHINGTON, June 16.â The ante
rooms of the White House fairly swarmed
to-day with politicians who had stopped
oft in Washington on their way to the Re
publican National Convention. Although
among them there were not a few party
leaders, the visitors had little opportunity
to converse with the President privately,
and those who did broach the subject of
the Vice Presidency â the uppermost topic
in the minds of allâ got ho intimation from
Mr. McKinley as to his personal choice.
If he has one.
Secretary Hitchcock accompanied a
large Missouri party, including D. M.
Houser, J. L. Minnis and D. L. Dyer, and
Senator Cullom of Illinois, with some Illi

MÂ®Hfoes*'s Love
Is boundless. Yet it is utterly fadeless
to give strength to the child born with a
low vitality. The time to give strength
to the child is before birth and to impart
this gift the mother herself must be
strong. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescrip-
tion gives strength to mothers. It pre-
serves them in robust health in the
months before baby comes. It practical-
ly does away with the pains of mother-
hood, and enables the mother to endow
h^r child with a healthy body and a
happy disposition. Â« Favorite Prescrip-
tion'* contains no alcohol and is abso-
lutely free from opium and cocaine.
Â¦ I consider Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription
the best medicine made," writes Mrs. Mary
Murdock. of 320 Taylor St., Topeka, Kansas. "I
know it has no equal. I am the mother of ten
children and only one livingâ the tenth one.
She is one year old and is as well and hearty as
can be. She is a beauty. Of my other babies,
some were born at right time, but dead, others
were premature births; one lived to be one year
old but she was always feeble. I tried different
doctors but none of them could tell what my
trouble was. I was examined by surgeons but
they found nothing wrong. I did not know
what to do. so I thought this last time I would
try Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. I took ft-
the entire nine months and now have a fine
baby jrirl, and I can not praise your medicine
enough for the good it did me."

NEW COAUNG STATION.
San Diego Harbor Selected by the
Navy Department.
WASHINGTON, June ! 16.â The Navy
Department has decided to establish a
coaling station of the second class at San
Diego. Cal. This decision has been reach
ed upon a report from Captain Field of
the Ranger, announcing the results of a
survey of the harbor at that place re
cently made by him. i The report states
that the minimum depth of water over the
bar at low tide is 21 feet and the tidal
rise amounts to about five feet, so there
is sufficient water for naval vessels of the
smaller type.
Further, the report states that it is en
tirely possible to coal the largest naval
ships in the bay to the east of the har
bor entrance, the water being sheltered
from the prevailing winds by the big kelp
bed, so that lighters could safely lie
alongside the warships.
The War Department, which owns the
large tract of land to the westward of the
harbor entrance, also has agreed to give
the Navy Pepartment sufficient ground
for station just above Ballast Point, and
as sqon as Captain Field has definitely
located the tract desired the reservation
will be announced.
MANAUENSE FINED.
Sailed From Vancouver Without
Proper Clearance Papers.
Special DiF^atch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. June 16.â The steam
er Mananenso was fined $400 by Collector
of Customs Smythe at the L>adysmlth col
lieries this afternoon. She left Vancouver
without clearance, without having filed a
manifest nor having paid harbor, dues,
says the collector.
The officers of the Manauense say the
matter is the result of a misunderstand
ing. They say they discharged the engi
neer at San Francisco and wired the Van
couver collector that Armstrong, the chief
engineer of the Manauense, had no British
papers, which are required by law be.,
fore clearance Is given, and the collector
t<Jld the officers of the steamer that they
must get an engineer with British papers
before clearance would be given. One was
secured in the early morning: and the
steamer sailed without, however, getting
clearance or filing a manifestâ in fact,
lefving her own articles behind. When
the Vancouver collector learned that she
had gone he notified Victoria and Lady
smith to seize her when she arrived. Tot
line was paid under protest.

ARCHBISHOP OF DUBUQUE.
to the Position.
Bishop Keane Soon to Be Appointed
WASHINGTON, June 16.â Advices have
reached the papal legation here from
Rome Indicating the early appointment of
Bishop Keane as Archbishop of Dubuque.
The appointment, it is said, would have
been made before this but for the an
tagonism of the German priests in that
see, who favor the selection of Fathet
Carroll, a professor at the Dubuque Semi
nary, for the vacancy. It is understood
that their opposition to Dr. Keane arises
from his attitude in the Schroeder case,
when that professor some months ago
was removed from the Catholic univer
sity In this city.

As. a dog catcher Sllnkey is Sausalito's
pride: no man in the town could ever come
near him when it came to luring the wan
dering bow-wow to the pound. His meth
od of executing the condemned canines Is
as original as it is perplexing to the rail
road officials. He drowns the dogs from
the wharf at Sausalito, and a prominent
railroad official to-Uay said that Slinkey
had used several tons of coupling pins and
tie plates belonging to the company for
the purpose of weighting his victims so
they would stay down. He has been for
bidden to drown dogs from the company's
wharf, and as he now. obeys the injunction
the railroad men know where to find their
coupling pins and other pieces of loose
Iron. Sllnkey is famous in other roles than
that of unsuccessful suicide.
The failure of his melodramatic per
formance yesterday has had a quieting
Influence on his disposition, and to-day
he has given little evidence of his exist
ence. He is believed to be at home nurs
ing a large lump on his forehead and try-
Ing by liberal deses of spring water to ex
tinguish the hot coals that are broiling his
stomach. According to his friends he haa
made his last attempt to end his life.
Henceforth he will continue to pursue and
impound the tagless and ownerless ca
nines that ill fortune may cast into the
town of Sausalito. Dog-catching is not as
pleasant /as the ladles' poolroom act, but
still. Bays Sllnkey, it Is much better on
second thought than the briny waters of
the bay. .
rescued by a faithful canine, which
dragged him ashore and then raised a
howl which brought a portion of the town,
with numerous barrels, over which the
luckless Slinkey was carefully rolled. It
was thought at the time that he had at
tempted suicide, but Siinkey claimed it
was an accident, and people let it go at
that.

About a year ago he was compelled to

He was promptly jailed and remained
there for some three days. It afterward
developed that by no human possibility
could Sllnkey have had any knowledge of
the crime, his alibi being patent to a hun

why he accused himself he said that he
felt a controlling thirst casting its spell
over him and that the County Jail was
the best place for hiÂ»n.
SAN RAFAEL. June 16.â Dan Sllnkey,
who attempted to commit suicide by
jumping into the bay yesterday afternoon,
is famous ln this county for his peculiar
escapades. Some ten years ago a mys
terious murder was committed in the
county, and the authorities -were looking
high and low for the murderer. Slinkey,
alive to the possibilities of the occasion,
presented himself at the Sheriff's office
and calmly proclaimed himself the Ions
sought murderer.

PORTO RICANS DISCUSS
INSULAR LEGISLATION
Believe the Island Should Reap the
Profit From the Kecoinage of
Its Silver.
EAN JUAN, Porto Rico, June 16.âTwer.
ty-fiva delegates, representing fifteen mu
nicipal governments, met in convention,
here last evening in preliminary session,
their object being to discuss insular af
fairs and suggest future legislation.
Among the items which they will recom
rner.d are the disposition of the 12.U&.WJ
appropriated by Congress; that the tele
graph system., at present controlled by
the army, be turned over to the munici
palitits; that a high tariff be imposed on
ealt imported from ail countries, thus
protecting the home product, and that the
surplus resulting from recolnage of Porto
Rican eilver be credited to the island.
The argument was put forward that the
silver peso and the dollar were equal, but
that the United States paid 60 cents for a
peso and coined It into a. dollar, leaving
a profit to the United States of 40 cents.
Mr. Elliott, the newly appointed Com
missioner of the Interior, took the oath of

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, June 16.â
'American troops will remain in Cuba in
definitely, perhaps permanently."
This was the emphatic declaration of a
Cabinet official to-day in answer to my
question as to the future policy of the
administration toward Cuba, now that the
elections had passed off satisfactorily and
without disturbance.
"Tfcer* was a wrong: Impression." con
tinued the official, "about the withdrawal
of our troops from .Cuba. The statement
has teen made frequently and widely cir
culated that, with the elections over, steps
would be immediately taken to recall the
larger portion of our troops, and that in
the very near future the American fias
Â¦would be hauled down, all of the forces
wlthflrawa and the island turned over to
the Cubans. It might Just as well be un
derstood now as at any other time that
no such policy Is possible. Probably after
the constitutional convention has been
held and a civil independent government
established, a portion of the &000 troops
now |a the island may be withdrawn. But
American troops, if only a regiment, will
remain in Cuba for many years to come.
"This does not mean that the adminis
tration contemplate* the annexation of
Cuba. On the contrary, the continued
presence of troops In the island will tend
to aesure the stability of an independent
government and thereby stave off annex
ation."
Th:s statement Is significant In that It
clearly demonstrates the purpose of Pres
ident McKinley to advocate a permanent
American protectorate over Cuba. While
many believe that Cuban annexation U
Inevitable, President McKinley will ad
here to the protectorate policy and aiiow
future administrations to deal with thÂ»
annexation question. V.'hen a new civil
head is elected for the government ot
Cuba the present plan contemplates turn-
Ing over to that official ail the civil
functions and the assumption by the
present American Governor of the com
mand of all of the military forces re
maining !n the island, much in the same
manner as was done in Puerto Rico when
Governor Allen relieved General Davis.
The main difference will be, of course,
that the new civil head will be a Cuban
and that t?Â» new government will be
nominally independent, but with an
American officer in command of troops
to assure the maintenance of peace ana
order.
President McKinley Believed to Fav
or th.e Establishment of a Perma-
m fluent American Protectorate

tention of Withdrawing

â¢ There 18 eucn a thing as compulsory hypnotism, which can be applied to any
person without bis censent. It is possible to shatter a human will as you mieht
break a china vase against a rock. But this is a new ar-d almost undeveloped field.
about which Uttle caa be said at present.
Where every other influence has failed to restore a man to moral sarlty
hypnotism has succeeded. So 1 would say that if it falls to extract a confession
from a criminal no other means can be used with success.
We can difceover the sense of right and wrong where none seemed to exist.
"We can overcome evil habits and awaken the higher self which never com
pletely dies in any man o-r woman.
The time may come when the old. Ineffectual mfthods of regeneratlne the
moral nature will be superseded by hypnotic treatment. The astocisfcing results
already attained prove this beyond question.
By hypnotism we ran reach people who are moral imbeciles, and by co ether
power known to man can you do this.
There le no <3crubt that hypnotism can and will be used to. detect crlnse. But
â¢we are only en the threshold of knowledge in this direction, and no one can set
limits to the future of hypnotism in overcoming the obstinacy of criminal?.
Generally ispeakir.g a gtrong-wllled man may still keep his criminal secret fa
spite of all influences, hypnotic or otherwise. As a rule criminals are very hard
to hypnotize, because they get their whole nature against the hypnotist, and
when a man Is under the influence of liquor It lit impossible to do anyttflcg- witn
him.
Hypnotism only gives us a means whereby we ran the more readily jret at the
divine man within- if is not so much a key to the door of a man's mind as a
more eSectual way o? ringing the doorbell and conversing with the occupant.
Hypnotism will not make a liar instantaneously veracious. It Is a very com
mon opinion that a hypnotist can completely capture the mind of his patient
without his consent and discover all the secrets of his past life.
PUBLIC Interest has been aroused recently on this question by the extortion
of a confeenion from a thief by means of hypnotism.
A confessio-n of crime obtained in this way may or may not be a valid
one. It la not necessarily infallible, any more than a voluntary confession
â¢would be. It would jyave to be verified by other evidence before it could be
seriously considered.
AN CFflCiflL OUTRAGE.
QUARANTINE OFFICER KINYOUN has
inflicted upon California a blow which will
go hx to offset ail the natural prosperity of
the time. He -'-as issued a circular quarantining the
Â«-fao2e State, his posted inspectors Et the State bor
dcrs Â¦,:â¢.".. instructions to allow r.o passengers from
Sao Francisco to pass the State line tinltss on prt-
Kestados c: Â£ certificaie signed by a Marine Hospital
cfiicer. The reason given for this extraordinary ac
tion :b that "the Lifting of the quarantine by order of
the Ft'i'.r;." court* u.Icvvs people "who have possibly
bte;< exposed to the infection of plague" to leave this
c:iy for other St^es.
Ccrjcerr.ir.g the motives that prompted the quaran
tine officer to this supreme act oi disastrous folly it
:= cot '.\orth while at this time to inquire. It appears
:':<Â¦.::: the circular that before it was issued inspectors
c: ;;.Â«.- Marine Hospital service had been already sta
tioned at the borders of the State. Everything had
beta prepared for the b!ow. The action therefore
â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦ â¢-Â¦':. cpon c. r.ue of facts known at the time
the case was under examination before
Jndge Morrow. Thus the evidence which Morrow
dismissed z.s irsut'r.cicnt to justify a quarantine oi"
Chinatown hts !ktâ¬T2 rsken by Kinyoun as sufficient to
yestifr f^uaxzniming the State.
."â¢ - not likely thst ary white person will find
much difficulty in obtaining a certificate. The order
hzs been issued r:ot to establish a genuine quarantine,
but to make a show of vigor which will impress the
people of the East. The reputation of San Francisco
asd aj] California :s to be injured, trade hampered
2nd prosperity checked for the sake of setting up a
dmxanj quarantine!
Judge Morrow has cited Kinyo"n to answer for
contempt of court, but that is not enough. The citi
zens ?hou!d speak out upon the subject. The issue is
to provide a remedy for the wrong. . That can be
done only by a wholesale, universal condemnation of
the order, znd a statement of facts showing the false-
Ecss of the prtt?nÂ«e under which it was issued. To
accomplish that there should be a general rnass
meeting. one thoroughly representative of the city.
and it thorsJd take every step that in the judgment of
the wisest i% detrr.ed necessary to relieve the city and
the State from &e curse put cpon it.
At the preterit tine there is a strong; delegation of
Caiiforai22s in Philadelphia in attendance upon the
Republican convention. As in a matter of Uiis kind
partisan considerations have no place, it might be
vonh uh:!c to profit by their presence in the East to
Esk thtrr. to lay before the President the facts of the
situation and him to revoke the po*er which
Kiaycun has abused. Were Congress in session the
Stste delegation would act in such an emergency, but
that dde^ation is scattered. Why, then, should not
the merchants and the citizens request the California
'.-,'< :Â¦-.'.:: ix Philadelphia to ict?
Whatever is to be Â«3one shcuid be done promptly.
It counts for nothing that Kinyoun and his ofneers
win give permission to ;ravc the Slate to even.- white
man that aisbes it. and that the quarantine is to be a
subject of mockery at home. The fact remains that
abroad it will be an evil of portentous magnitude to
fjr trade and to our industries. It threatens loss to
ill, di?Â£Ker to vzzr.y znd ruin to sorne. Let the peo
ple pet together, advise and take action.
Here, then, is an evil which the better element of
the people must unite to suppress. If the Grand
jury, the police, the courts and the law be alike pow
erless, there remains the community. The people are
not powerless. They can amend the law, strengthea
the Grand Jury, rouse the police to activity and put
upon the bench men who will not permit the law to
be mocked by any trick or device that rascalit}- can
practice.
Should the courts be powerless we must have re
course to the Legislature this winter and have the
laws amended. We have put ao end to racetrack
gambling, and the next step must be that of closing
the places where gambling is carried on under other
forms. The vice is the most pernicious that entices
youth. It leads men to waste their earnings, tempts
them to dishonesty and so on by swift steps from one
degree of crime to another, until in too many cases
the end is-murder or suicide.
The complaint is an old one, for the evil is one of
long standing. It is clear there exists either a defect
in our laws or a weakness in the courts, and perhaps
there are both. Judge Belcher's decision upon the
Reno marriages shows that the courts have power to
prevent the evasion by subterfuge of the marriage law.
Why, then, can they not prevent the evasion of the
laws against gambling, when the subterfuges prac
ticed are so transparent as those described by the
Grand Jury? It would seem that a court resolutely
determined to make 'the law respected could find a
means of preventing its open violation under such
shallow trickery as is practiced by the more notorious
offenders. It would certainly be worth while for some
Judge to put the matter to the test and see if the
Supreme Court will sanction a subterfuge that thinly
conceals so gross an evil as that of public gambling
along the principal thoroughfares of the* city.
The report then goes on to specify poolrooms,
i poker game resorts, so-called "commercial broker
| age" establishments, where gambling in one form or
I another is openly carried on, and points out that in
; many places there are nickel-in-the-slot machines
which are virtually a means of affording gambling
opportunities. Efforts have been made to suppress
these places by grand juries and by the police, but
the efforts have failed. In explanation of the failure
the report says: "The police have arrested the pro
prietors of these establishments several times, but the
courts, both Police and Superior, have dismissed the
cases on the ground that it is not a percentage or
banking game, and htr.ee not against the law. * * *
Our Superior Court says that playing draw-poker is
a game of skill and not of chance. So that when
phyed without a banking or percentage feature it
I is within the law. These open poker games have, of
course, to make a profit out of the players. The or
dinarv 'drop or draw-out' would be unlawful- This
i difficulty is overcome by a very palpable subterfuge,
namely, the house sells the players two packs of cards
i an hour and a check, which entitles the plaj-er to
| io cents' worth of refreshment from the house when
ever he chooses to take it."
The justness of the plea is made evident by the
statement of facts regarding public gambling. On
that score the report says: "No faro, no roulette, no
crap games that we could find. If there are any, anJ
we think there are in a cosmopolitan city of this size,
they are so quiet that they cannot do much harm.
There is a great deal of gambling carried on with the
law's sanction, too much for the good of the youth
and weak adults of the city, who cannot resist wasting
their hard-earned money in a foolhardy effort to get
something for nothing."
ONCE more a Grand Jury has closed its career
with a report containing many good recom
mendations and also excuses for the failure to
achieve satisfactory results in the way of the suppres
sion of evils' and indictment for crime. The report
indorses the recommendation of a former body that
the powers of grand juries should be strengthened,
and says: "The Grand Jury is condemned by the
pxblic for failing to do that which it is powerless to
do, no matter how anxious or how willing, and is
held in mockery and contempt by many who should
fear it most."
THE GRflND JURY REPORT.
f\ NEW" play by Augustus Thcmas is always an event to j
I J be looked forward to with interest. Since Bronson |
Kn Howard retired with well-earned laurels Mr. Thomas is j
/ the only one among our playwrights who shows prom- I
* ise of being able to fill his place. The only j/erson who ,
can even be mentioned in competition with him is Wiiliam
Gillette, whose knowledge of construction is second only to
Mr. Pinero's. but whose capacity to portray character has not j
yet been demonstrated. Now. dramas that excel only in me- j
chanical construction never live as do those which truthfully j
and vividly portray character: that Is why Scribe is to-day j
merely a name while Angier and Dumas are living forces; that ,
is why "Alabama" and "In Mizzoura" axe better plays than
"Secret Service." â _, _
In his m-.st recent work, "Arizona" (R. H. P.ussell. New-
York). Mr. Thomas has followed out the plan he so success- j
fully employed in his former playsâ the plan of making a study ,
o r American character in a locality where that character has j
developed free from the ir.fi uencts of European civilization. .
Life In a great city of the Atlantic seaboard is not very differ
ent from life in a great city of Western Europe, but Hte^ln j
Arizona presents conditions ar.d develops types quite un.fte j
anything to be found between the JCeva and the Ouadalquiver. I
Such a type in "Arizona" Is Henry Canby, owner of the j
Aravaipa ranch, a cattle king whose heart is as grr-at as biÂ« j
fortune He has two daughters. Estrella and BorJta, the
Conner marriÂ»d to Colonel Bonham of the Eleventh United I
S'ates Cavalryâ a mun considerably older than herself. Bon-;
ham knows that his wife 1p not happy but does not know the j
cause: father-in-law, beirg consulted, gives this sensible ex
planation, couched in language delightfully "Arizonese:
Canby [rfsing and walking]â Colonel. I've broke a good many
bolts broke lots of *ern to go double. When you first yoke 'em ]
up they jes 1 v.-hip-saw that way. [He pantomimes a sudden and j
d ! sconcerted pulling with his .hands.] They ain't never both
agin the tugs at the same time. Then I give 'em the gaff, an'
after they've run 'emselves nearly to a standstill. I point 'em
home. They come back together like the wheelers in a band
wagon.
Colonelâ But I'm no colt, Governor.
Canbyâ You are at gittin' married: and all new married folks
are jes' the sane. For a while whip-sawâ then bolt. Some bolt
harder and more of it than others, but they boltâ all of 'em.
Colonelâ Well, are Estrella and I whip-sawii:? or bolting?
Canby [resuming his place at the table)â I take it you're j
boltln'. I Each of you thinks if he could only run a little faster i
he'd get away from the other: but you can't. You're yoked, j
Now, that don't mean trouble; it simply means you ain't used
to your harness.
But It Boon appears that Canby's explanation Is more pictur- .
esque than accurate; Colonel Bonham has a rival for his wife's I
affections In the person of one Captain Hodgman. a younger j
end handsomer man. When the colonel is one evening sum
moned to Los Angeles Mrs. Bonham arranges to elope trith j
Hodpman: gives him her jewels (this is a bit ancient. Mr. j
Thomas!) and is stayed upon the eve of Tight on!y by the in- i
terposition of one LJeutenant Denton. a friend of the colonel, j
â¢who threatens to shoot Hodgman unless he desist from his pur
pci?e. Hodgman desisting and the colonel returning unexpect
edlyTDenton finds the tables turned; he is himself compromised
by "his well-intentioned presence in Mrs. Bonham's house and j
by her jewels <which he. had taken from Hodgmant being found |
in his pocket; at her entreaty and in order to save her repu- |
tation he refupes to the colonel any explanation; this leads
to the colonel's forcing him to resign from the army in dis
grace. This situation closes the second act.
The third act oper.s vcith Denton as major-domo at Canby's
ranch, to which he had come, drawn by love for Bonita, after )
his resignation from the army. Bonita is evidently willing and
things look happy for Denton when the Eleventh Cavalry,
en rout*? to the war (with Spain) stop at the Aravaipa ranch.
Kodgman repeats the slander about Mrs. Bonham and Demon;
the latter strikes Hodgman, who, the next moment, is fatally

Ab intimated above, Mr. Thomas is much stronger in cha-

frank, impulsive and affectionateâ no prude, yet never overstep

successfully started in better days, this is how she settles tiu

That !s her serious raocd; here ehe is sketched in Btgttti

THOSE COMMISSIONERS.
fifty reporters rose in gratified chorus, "We slill hold
our job."
lessons. Deacon Fitch, who had moved uneasily in
his sleep, drew a long breath and snored away to
dreamland sgain, and from the experienced throats of
THE Democratic State Convention rose to the
height of an "occasion." To the directing
mind of the Examiner it was a high board
fence upon which to advertise. The plan adopted
was to. secure the indorsement of Sillybilly for the
Vice Presidency. With that poster on the boards
the convention would have served its only purpose
cf benefit to that newspaper. But when it comes to
advertising, using anything from a swollen gland cut
from the groin of a. Chinese to the wreck of the
Maine, the Examiner takes no chances on one
method alone. So it decided to have three sandwich
men in the convention to tote its sign on back and
brisket. It employed them, and to tickle their van
ity named them "commissioners."' They were to
send the most inner, inmost, inside news, right from
the slick and reeking viscera of the convention. The
commissioners selected were those time-seasoned
journalists, Judge James Maguire, Mayor James Phe
lan and ex-Governor James Budd. The use of these
three Jimmies was it once suggestive of the bur
glarious ways the paper follows in getting news.
They were to be used in forcing the lock of that
sinister secrecy which keeps the inner confidences of
a convention in- Â£S deep darkness as the parlor of a
prairie dog.
The ordinary newspaper slaves of plumbago, who
have to look at things from the vast outside and
skirmish for a knowledge of the contents, looked
with envy upon this trinity of talent, who were bear
ers of the sesame, and wore their sandwich-boards as
knights did their armor* In despair some of the
plain reporters resorted; to drink and some to their
imagination, both equally intoxicating. The news
was to be had only from the commissioners.
Each had pad and pencil, and each was tagged as
Examiner propert3 r , like a prize pointer at a bench
Ehow. In the convention were persons distinguished
in many ways. Spellbinders were there, who had
held crowds in such izpt silence that a pin dropped
sounded like a clap of downeast thunder. Leaders
walked that floor who for forty years have pointed
with alarm or viewed with pride the doings of many
administrations. True party men appeared who ha<l
ridden the Democratic horse though saddled as high
zs Mount Diablo. Faithful workers mingled with
the throng who had many times furred their tongues
apd made their beads split with pain, next morning,
:;7 advancing the principles of the party. Again they
came, to lay their wounded livers before the lights of
the party, that their infirmities gotten in the wars of
Bacchus might plead for recognition. But what
v. ere these to the three high commissioners, who
were to wrench from the convention the only pur
pose for which it met, an advertisement for the yel
low paper, which is 3ike a dark brown taste in the
public mo'uth!
The Only Three, the great Would Be, the Has
Been, and the Might Have Been, were there, and
others huddled around their six legs in lilliputian
timidity, hoping that they might float to fame as part
of the news to be born on the points of their potent
pencils.
After a proper period of absorption of information
and a further time for incubation, which in the case
of the Would Be was timed to the allotted probation
given to the germs of bubonic plague, the commis
sioners sought solitude and wrote, while a section
of the longest leased wire in the world spit on its
hands, humped its back, tried the strength of its in
sulator? and got ready to bear the burden and jocund
freshness ot the news to be. The first jimmy applied
10 the door of the situation was that of Judge Ma
guire, and the Might Have Been sharpened his pen
cil, moistened the same with his silver tongue, and
wrote: "Inhhis convention I find full delegations.
The recent scandals arising out of the election of
United States Senators, the waiving of the right to
fortify the Nicaragua canal, the Porto Rican tariff,
the constitution follows the flag."
The locked chamber where the Has Been stuck
his torjrue in his cheek, as an aid to composition,
being occupied by ex-Governor Budd, gave forth the
sound of stage thunder. Wondering listeners seemed
to hear railroad tracks torn up. chewed and spit out.
and depots crumbling into ruin. The clatter of rates
falling and the prayers of Huntington for mercy
made it seem Jike a chamber of horrors. The uneasy
ghosts of two Republican Legislatures gibbered to the
air in threats of suit for breach of promise. In due
time this commissioner appeared bathed in a cold
sweat and handed to the waiting messenger pages on
which appeared, inscribed in letters of living light,
the News: "The Democratic State Convention ad
journed to-night, and left no sting."
The Would Be sought his room, double-locked the
door and let the portcullis fall. An eager throng
thirsting for information blockaded the hallway. At
fiist there issued sounds of feasting such as trickle
from a private dining-room of the Pacific-Union
Club. There was the genial popping of corks, the
sound of nosing a canvasback that has felt the fire
just seventeen minutes. Then there were the wailings
of the disappointed, followed by the protests of a
ponkey against a squirt of germs from a Chinese
bubo. Then silence fell, to be broken by the cry of
the banshee, and soon were heard the struggles of an
expiring ambition. Then the death-rat',le rose and
solemnized the air and all was still. The Would Be
appeared at the door, pale but calm, and handed out
the News: "The Democratic convention appeared to
be a representative body. There is something for
midable in the assemblage of men from all sections of
the State. In the last election Mr. Bryan polled
144.000 votes. Mr. McKinley polled over 146,000
votes. This convention acts, behaves and appears in
every respect as a body."
The wire stretched to its task as this hot stuff
struck it, and the fluid sputtered at every insulator.
The ghosts of John Bonner, George Frederick Par
sons and Loring Pickering, which had sat up in ap
prehension, returned to their harps and their music
Not until the full reports of the census officials have
been published showing the increase of population
throughout all the region around the bay shall we
know how much has been the real gain of San Fran
cisco during the decade. Thousands of those who
live in the suburbs are active citizens of San Fran
cisco and only sleeping citizens elsewhere. Their
work, their business and most of their wealth is here,
and they are virtually citizens of the metropolis.
There is therefore no reason why we should be down
cast over the preliminary estimate that our increase
Avill be only about 14 per cent. The official figures of
the bay district will give us a better showing.
The climate of San Francisco and the district
around the bay is such as to .encourage families to
live outside the city. By a short ride one gets away
from the fogs and winds of the peninsula on which
the city stands and finds ample space for homes where
the climate is perennially delightful. The ferries and
the railroads that connect the city with the outlying
suburbs afford abundant accommodation for all who
wish to come and go. There'is never a season of the
}xar and hardly even a single day when it is unpleasant
to make the trip from the city to any of its suburbs. It
is therefore inevitable that the tendency toward
suburban life which is so marked a feature of our
time should be. more pronounced here than else
where^ for in no other part of the country is such
life so agreeable at ill times.
By adding large sparsely settled districts to their
cities the people of Chicago, St. Louis. Brooklyn and
New York have enabled a considerable population to
find homes without going out of town. The rapid
transit lines render it convenient for thousands to live
in the suburbs who formerly would have been com
pelled to live downtown. Thus in cities where the
suburbs have been annexed the population has in
creased by great percentages, but where no such an
nexation has taken place the trend of population to
the suburbs has diminished the natural increase of the
city itself.
there has been a very large percentage of increase
of population has during the past decade annexed a
wide sweep of suburban area, while in those where the
increase has been comparatively small there has been
no such extension of boundary, '*,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CxlXL, SUNDAY, JUNE 17. 1900.
Oozn Paul's statement, "Wherever I am there is the
j capital of the Transvaal," may be takeo as a proof he
I is carrying the treasury with hinv .
Colonel Jack Chinn is quoted as saying recently:
"Every man in Kentucky who needs hanging will
get it," and for once the sympathy of the nation is
with him. Such sentiments are popular, and it is to
be hoped the prediction is true.
And now comes an expert who declares the wild
jubilation of the British over their recent victories to
be due to the fact that oi late years they have taken
to drinking claret and coffee like the French" instead
of sticking to beer; but perhaps a good deal of the
hilarity was due to too much beer.
The official figures will of course show some errors
in these estimates, but in the main they will probably
stand good. We shall therefore have in the census of
this year a striking illustration of the effect of trolley
cars and other modes of rapid transit in stimulating
the development of suburban districts around Jargc
cities. It will be noted that each of the cities where
IH^ROM the preliminary reports received from
census omcials engaged in counting the popula
tion of cities :t is evident that one of the notable
features of the census of this year will be the enor
mous differences in the gains of various cities. Thus
it is estimated New York proper will show an in
crease of population of something like 33 per cent,
Brooklyn 57 per cent. St. Louis 52 per cent and Chi
cago 68 per cent, while Philadelphia will show bat
15 per cent increase and San Francisco hardly more
than 14 per cent.

Tax Collector Scott has succeeded in
collecting about $103,000 In taxes from va

âthe Savingrs and Loan Societyâ that has
not paid its taxes, amounting to $10,924.
but it is understood that payment will be
made to-morrow. As soon as this amount

THERE Is considerable activity ln the
matter of arranging the work of the
eeveral sub-committees of the gen
eral committee oi the Native Sons
of the Golden West that Is preparing for
the celebration of the semi-centennial of
the admission of the State Into the Union.
The committee on naval parade la work
ing out an elaborate plan for the event
on the bay, which it is proposed to make
the main feature of the celebration. It Is
proposed to ask the United States Navy
Department to issue an order that all
war vessels at Hare Island take part in
the naval displav and to that end Con
gressman Julius Kahn, who is now In the
city, will, it is said, lend his assistance.
It is proposed that the sham battle shall
be made more realistic by the use of
large tugs to represent torpedo destroyers
and having them chase escaping vessels
and fire after them. Colored bombs to ex
plode over or near vessels which shall
take part in the battle will be fired from
mortars. The vessels that take part in,
the parade will be illuminated and it Is
expected that everything than can steam
will be pressed into the service in order
to make this the grandest display of this
kind that has ever been seen on the bay.

DODGE LOSES
SUIT AGAINST
WAREHOUSEMAH
Justice Barry Decides That
He Did Not Follow the
Statute.
Justice of the Peace Barry rendered a
judgment yesterday in favor cf A. B.
Caldwtll, a warehouseman who was sued
by Assessor Dodge rfor J100 penalty for
refusal to be examined and testify to a
Fiattrnerit furnished by Caidwell. A sec
or.d complaint was also filed against Cald
vt'l Tor refusal to produce the books of
his business as a warehouseman and re
: utal to testify concerning property aj-
I'-ged to be on storage in his warehouse.
Judge Barry, in a lengthy document, re
'. Itws the evidence and, while not denvlng
the right of the Assessor to obtain a
; idSBMCt for a statutory penalty, under
section 2-X2 of the Political Code, he holds
that the Assessor did not proceed against
Caidwell according to the express terms
f the statute. Barry agTees with the
contention of Caldwell, who, though sub
stantially admitting the facts, denied their
: :--;i! sut3ci<?ncy.
In the preface to his opinion Judge Bar
ry :ays:
The amount rued for li comparatively email,
1 Bt the question* involved are grave ar.d im
j.orTiint- They affect property rights of the
> ;t:z-Â»:iÂ» as well &c determine come of the
powers cf Assessors. A desire to give them
Â¦ ireful study with a view of arriving at a
1 t'ical asd iuft conclusion has possibly de
layed n-.y decisi-n much longer than is gen
? rally taken with ciatter* submitted for de
tenntaittiea in Justices* courts.
The material points of the decision fol
low i
The entire inquiry cf the Assessor was net
tb< Bt the defendant's property, but about
rther people's property. It was directed to
the defendant as a warehouseman, and as to
â¢wfcat eoods. If any. he tad on storage ln his
fai<1 warehouse and belonging to other persons
Â£"d not to any property of the defendant him-
by the defendant. By no process of reasoning
can questions put to a person concerning other
people's property be resolved into or construed
as an inquiry concerning his own property, or
testimony given about other people's property
be resolved into or construed as a refusal to
testify la relation to a statement made and
presented to an Assessor setting forth the
property owned by the person presenting such
etatement.
The subpena served on Caldwell is too gen
eral and indefinite. The defendant is com
manded to appear and as declared, "testify in
reference to a statement made by you now
on file in my offlce." What Etatement or kind
cf a statement did the defendant make? Was
it a etaten-.ent with regard to assessable prop
erty or wa* It a statement in regard to some
other matters? If it was a statement with
regrard to assessable property wat it of asses
sable prcjjerty owned by defendant on the first
Unr. of March of this year or at some time
pre\j~*j to that date? The subpena uses the
language "now on file in my office": but when
was ii filed? Was it on the first Monday of
March. l&Â», or on March 20, 1900 (the date of
the subper.a). cr at tome time between those
dates, cr was it filed prior to the first Monday
of March. 1KÂ«?
In aa analagous case In principle (ex parts
Jaynes, 70 Cal.) tÂ£ere was more deflnitenesa
than ln this caee. There particular persons, a%
also a specific period, were mentioned; here
there is nothing definite or epeciflc in regard to
books or paters or person* or dates. The AÂ«
eeesor has the undoubted right under the law to
require a person to present a statement to him
cf the property owne-1 by ruch person on the
Cret Monday in March cf each year, and if he
believes euch statement to be false or inac
curate ln any particular he may bring such
party before him fcr the purpose of examining
him in regard to such statement; cr the As
e*ssor may require any other person to appear
and bÂ« examined relative to his knowledge of
euch a person's statement and to tell If he has
property ln his possession belonging to euch
person, specifying him; and if his books show
that at a particular time mentioned and defi
nitely stated he had in his possession property
belonging to such other specified and designated
perscn, possibly command him to brir.g specified
end designate 1 bocks: but the Assessor car.not
by a general order. Indefinite as to books, pa
pers. r>Â«rfor.s or time, command one rerson to
examine books or papers ur.der his control to
ascertain if other persons not mentioned had ga
eome indefinite time stored property, whether
assessable cr not. with him, or command him to
obey an order of the character presented here.
C*n it be eaid that a pereon has refused to
testify concerning a matter on which he has
never been examined or questioned?
Whatever ether powers the Aesessor may have
for the purpose of enforcing the penalty pro
vided by secticn 3C22, he has only the powers
granted therein, and he can enforce them only
in the manner and to the extent provided
therein. For these reasons I think the motion
of the defendant should prevail. Let Judgment
fcr defendant be prepared accordingly.

Writ of Mandate- Granted F. Patek,
Conmelling Auditor to Sign I>e
mands Payable From This
Reserve,
Judge Seawell has decided that the sum
of $125,000 set aside for the purpose of buy
ing land to form the proposed St. Mary's
Park Is really a part of the general fund,
and as such can be drawn upon by any
one having claims against the city.
The decision was rendered in the suit of
Frederick Patek against the city for a
meat bill of $73. There was no money in
the general fund except the $125,000 set
aside to buy the land for the proposed
park, but Patek claimed that thi3 wa3
part of the general fund and so liable to
his claim. He rought a writ of mandate
compelling the Auditor to sign his demand
so it could be paid from this money, and
the court has granted his writ. Following !
is Judge Seawell's decision: â¢ j
Section 3714 of the Political Code, Â¦which baa i
been cited here, provides that the Board of !
Supervisors of each county must on the third j
Monday cf . September fijt the rate of county j
taxes, designating the number of cents ln each
one hundred dollars of property levied for each
fund, and must levy the State and county
taxes upon the taxable property of the county, j
Ily order .No. 216. which was adopted on the j
liih of September, l&Si, providing revenue far j
municipal purposes for the Â£s;ai year ending i
June 30. 1900, a tax was lÂ«led for city and :
county purix>st9 on all property, both real and
personal, in the city and county of San Fran
cisco, except such property as Is by law ex- !
empt from taxation, the sum of $1,029 on each
cne hundred dollars valuation of said taxable
Â¦ property upon the assessment books of said '
fiscal year. I quote from the order levying
taxes: "The sum of f 1.029 on each one hundred
dollars valuation as atoresaid Is hereby ap
' portioned to the funds and accounts known
and designated as follows." And then there
is a list of the various funds and the amount
| apportioned to each. To the general fund was
I apportioned .â¬7 dollars and a fraction. It la
| claimed that in that general fund, although
tbere is mention of it in the order levying
the tax, that the Board of Supervisors really
levied a tax of some small sum, enough to
raise J12i.0w> for the acquisition of the prop
erty known as St. Mary's Square.
V.'hatever may have been the Intention of
the Board of Supervisors I can only look to
the order as thty passed It to indicate the
funds to which they apportioned the amount
of thos taxes. I find that there is no money
I set apart in that order for the acquisition of
St. Mary's Park. There is no mention any
where In It that there 13 levied a tax for the
acquisition of that park. It is simply gen
erally a tax of one dollar and a fraction on
each one hundred dollars valuation of the tax
able property in the city and that one dollar
is distributed among several funds, among
which is de general fund, and in which there
is now over $300,000 If the JU'5,000 which it is
claimed was intended for the acquisition of
St. Mary's Park is to be considered a part
of the general fund.
The only evidence before me aa to any in
tended separation of the general fund into
verious items of expenditure is contained ln
order No. 217, which was passed after the
order levying the tax. That order Is of a
negative character. It says simply that th-s
various departments are limited, they shall
not spend mere than this sum in the first
fix months and another sum ln the last six
months: that there shall not be expended more
than 1125.000 fcr St. Mary's Park during the
first six months and that there shall be noth
ing expended for that in the last six months
of the fiscal year. There is no attempt here
| to levy a tax, nothing in this supple-mental
order which affirmatively declares that the
tax was levied for that purpose. It merely
restricts the proper department of the muni
cipality from expending more than $125,000 ln
the rirst six months for the purchase of that
park. There is no affirmative grant oÂ£ power
ln anybody to expend that, but it presup
poses evidently that there was some valid au
thority for the expenditure of that money. But
certainly in the order levying the tax It no
where appears that the tax was levied for
I the purpose of acquiring that park. There is
i no mention of it anywhere. There is mention
I of eo much for the general fund and the law
I declares that the demand for money now be
fore the court shall bo paid out of the general
fund, eo Ions as there is money there to pay
it with.
I do not think it necessary at all to consider j
these other questions ln reference to the act
of. 1SS0, or the effect of the charter. I am;
clearly of opinion that this $125, COO is a part !
of the general fund, ar.d is applicable to the i
payment of all demands payable out of that I
fund.
In reference to the question as to whether |
there should be an Intervention here the pro- i
posed Intervenor is simply a taxpayer, aa I j
understand it. and has no greater, interest in |
the controversy than any other citizen. There '
is no claim here that the officer is shirking â¢
his duty. In fact the only suggestion made j
Is that he may not appeal from the decision, j
I do not consider that a sufficient bails upon J
which to authorize an intervention of this ;
kind, and evpn If there was such an inter- ,
vention It would not prevent the Auditor from i
auditing the amount if he chose. An appeal
by the Intervenor would not have any effect j
upon the volition of the Auditor. My decision, ,
of course, Is not that of a court of final re- \
Bort. He may or may not be satisfied w!th j
my opinion. But I do not think 1 would be !
JustilicU. so long as he is here in the per
formance of his duty representing the munici
pality, being the proper officer and particularly
where he has allowed counsel to appear In the
Interest of the parties who resist the claim
of the applicant here, I do not think I would
be justified ln authorizing an intervention, j
which is not at all necessary, because if the i
lntervi-nor thinks that this claim should be
resisted he has the opportunity of bringing
an action and can enjoin the Treasurer from
paying the amount ln case the Auditor should
allow It and urÂ»on such a suit aa that of ,
course he would have to give a bond. But in j
a small amount of this kind, involving only j
seventy-four or- seventy-five dollars, I think it i
would be an abuse of discretion on my part j
If I Khould allow the unnecessary intrusion of j
a mere citizen who has no other interest than j
any other citizen or taxpayer in the matter. ;
I therefore deny the application for inter- Â¦
venticn and the writ will be made peremptory. ;
There are claims against the city that !
amount in the aggregate to much more ]
than the amount of the St. Mary's Park Â¦
fund, and ur.der the decision of Judge Sea- i
well they can all be paid out of that $125,- |
GOO. Should the Supreme Court uphold
his decision the fund will be wiped out j
within a few days.
The denial of the Intervenor, Christian '
Rets, makes it very possible that there j
will be no appeal from the decision of !
Judge Seawell. It was announced to the |
court that the principal idea of the Inter-;
vention was that should the Auditor not
appeal the intervenor could do so, but the")
decision bars this, and if the Auditor )
should not appeal there will he no further
proceedings and Judge Seawell's decision
will stand.
\V. A. Rix represented the plaintiff in
the action and he had opposed to him
Harry Cresweli. Garret McEnerney, Lloyd
& Wood and others.
Judge Seawell Declares That
It Is a Part of the
General Fund.

Summerland Has Tanks Full of Oil
and Is Seeking a Way to Mar
ket Its Product to Best
Advantage.
The use of fuel oil has been demon
strated-to be a success on the new British
steamship Assyrian. First the steamer
was run on coal fuel for speed. Then oil
was tried and the speed was nearly a
knot more than when the Scotch coal was
in the furnaces. \ Tho revolutions were
seven to eight more per minute and the
horse-power 200 more than during- the coal
trials, while the steam pressure of ISO
pounds was obtained with ease, notwith
standing that all the auxiliary machinery
was running the whole time. These facts
tfre given by the Railway and Engineer-
Ing Review, which adds that the con
sumption of oil at the trial was found to
be 2o per cent less per horse-power than
the consumption of coal. All indications
favor the belief that the consumption of
fuel oil will be largely augmented in a
variety of ways. When the oil is uni-
The coming fall will probahly mark the
beginning of a governmental examination
of the petroleum fields of California. Tho
fact has previously been published that
George H. Eldridge, one of the geologists
employed in the Geological Survey, has
completed an examination of the asphajt
districts. Director Charles! D. Walcott has
lately promised Congressman Waters
that, if possible, a party will be put Into
the field soon under the direction of Mr.
Eldridge to look into the petroleum de
posits. y

SACRAMENTO, June 16.â Much com
ment has been made concerning the ab
sence of Senate constitutional amendment
No. 13, authorizing San Francisco to pay
certain outstanding bills from the statute3
and amendments to the codes, as issued
by the State Printing Office. Because of
Fuch omission San Francisco cannot gain
tho sought-for authority, and there has
boon a general roar from those who hold
the claims, which are Bald to reach
nearly $250,000. . â . .
In response to the statement published
in a San Francisco paper that the omis
sion was Ms fault. State Printer Johnston
d<tlares that the amendment in question
was never certified to his ofnee, as the law
requires, and furthermore that as the As

A new oil Held is developing west of
Los Angeles. On and near the Brea
ranch several wells have been drilled,
which produce oil at moderate depths, ami
now, farther out, on the Durfy ranch, a
mile northwest of Sherman, oil has been
found seeping from the ground In several
places. The ranch of 220 acres has been
bonded for twenty years and a company
has been incorporated by Los Angeles
and Santa Ana men with a capital of $400,
000, which will at once commence sinking
a well in the foothills above the seepage.
Los Angeles oilmen have begun to pay
attention to various parts of Santa Bar
bara County. B. H. Dyer has taken up a
strip on the beach near Miramar, between
what are known as the Illinois and Cham
pion claims. G. L. Daube of Chicago,
who Is interested in several oil proposi
tions near Los Angeles, has also been
quietly investigating in Santa Barbara.
While prospectors were recently search-
Ing for indications of oil in San Diego
County they discovered a deposit of bi
tuminous rock near tho ocean side of
Point Loma. The extent of the deposit,
will need investigation. Claims have been
tiled. The oil exploiters are busy in San
Diego County. The Escondido Oil and De
velopment Company has leased large
tracts near Escondido and Enclnitas. One
filing has taken in 10.5G0 feet of the bay
front south of Twenty-second street, San
Diego. A 40-acre claim has, according to
the San Diego Union, been tiled on the
Pacific Ocean. Two IGO-acre claims have
been filed in the Carriso Creek country on
the desert. In these last named W. W.
Bowers is one of the parties interested.
The Daily Oil News, published in Los
Angeles, says that crude petroleum can
be largely utilized to produce gas and
that petroleum has been found to be ex
ceedingly well adapted to the manufac
ture oi gas and a very large proportion
of the Coalinga oil is so utilized.
For fuel purposes in factories and on
all manner of engines the heavier oils are
considered the best, but for the manufac
ture of gas the more volatile the better is
the oil, and the lighter grades, such as
are produced at Coalinga. Fullerton and
some other localities, constantly increas
ing in vdlume. may yet prove to be the
housewife's delight.
Boring for oil is proceeding in many new
places. Charles H. Polley of Hueneme,
ventora County, is working on the desert
at Salt Wells station. San Bernardino
County, near Johannesburg. The directors
of the Tehama County Oil Company have
contracted with John Ferguson of Stock
ton to sink a well near Red Bluff, using
a. rig that has been employed In boring
for water in Sonoma County. Six oil
claims have just been located in the Little
Cow district, in Shasta County.
The Santa Barbara Press says:
At the present time things are a little dull
In the Summerland oil fields. The cause is the
lack of a market. Formerly the Southern Pa

the railroad people have wells of their own,
and at the Oxnard factory their storage ca

what their contract calls for, but no more.
So the Summerland people are looking for a
market. Most of the tanks are full, and In
some instances it has been necessary to dis
continue pumping. How long this condition
will last no one seems to be able to tell, but
it Is more than probable that some decisive
steps will be taken by the producers to relieve
the glut. The tank steamer has been sug
gested as one means to this 'end.
This provides an easy and cheap mode of
transportation, the freight to San Francisco
amounting to 15 or 10 cents per barrel. Tank
steamers have b een running Irom Ventura'for
several years, carrying- the product of the
s^anta Paula field, and recently a line was
established between San Pedro and San Fran
cisco. California's sreat metropolis will af
ford an immense and growing market for pet
roleum, as Boon as It is certain that the sup
ply may be depended upon.
The fight between the two oil exchanges
in Los Angeles is on. Some days ago an
announcement was made that the call
would begin in the Los Angeles Oil Ex->
change at 10 o'clock. Several of the bro
kers are members of both exchanges, and
they declared that the move, which was
ordered by the board of governors, was
spite work. This the board diplomatically
denied and pointed out the fact that all
the great exchanges in the world begin at
10 a. m. The by-laws give the board of
governors power to llx the time for the
call, and they have availed themselves of
that prerogative.
Some recent moves In various oilfields
are as follows: The Erie Oil Company
has purchased SSO acres of land in Ventura
County lying between the Bardsdale wells
nnd Torrey Canyon. Two pipe lines run
through the district. The Freeman & Nel
son White Oil Company has been organ
ized to develop the territory in the New
hall district, where a "white" oil is pro
duced. J. A. Patten of Los Angeles ha3
leased COO acres In the McKittrlck district.

ADVEBTISEMENTS,
WHOLESALE ADVICE
For People Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poor.
Dr. Harlandson, whose opinion In dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
man or woman comes to me complaining
of Indigestion, loss of appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour vratery-rislng, head-
aches, sleeplessness, lack of ambition and
a general run-down nervous condition I
advise them to take after each meal tne
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lowing the tablets to dissolve In the
mouth, and thus mingle with the food
eaten. The result is that the food is
speedily digested before It has time to
sour and ferment. These tablets will di-
gest- the food anyway whether the stom- ;
ach wants to or not, because they contain
harmless digestive principles, vegetable
essences, pepsin and Golden Seal which
supply just what the weak stomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with great
success both In curing indigestion and to
build up tho tissues, increasing flesh in
thin, nervous patients, whose real trouble
was dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
ach was put to rights they did not know
what sickness was.
A 50-cent packape of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be bought at any drug store,
and as they are not a secret patent medi-
cine they can 'be used' as often as de-
sired with full assurance that they con-
tain nothing harmful In the slightest de-
gree; on the contrary, any one whose
stomach Is at all deranged will find great
benefit from the use of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets. They will cure any form of
stomach weakness or diseases except can-
cer of the stomach.

222S accidents last year, three-founds of
which were due to carelessness.
According to the French patent laws,
public disclosure of an ln-ention before
the filing of an application for a patent
often deprives the Inventor of his ri^ht to
a valid French patent. The law of May
23, 1SGS, provides, however, that Invention's
exhibited at international exhibitions mav
be protected, as if they were patented,
from the time they are received at the ex
position until three* months after the clos
ing of the exposition.

It Is only a question of a few short
months when almost the entire fleet of
sailing vessels ownta in the United States
will have its home port In San Francisco.
During the past twelve months nearly a
hundred ships, barks and barkentines
have been sold by New York owners to
Pacific Coast parties, nearly every one of
which has gone into the sugar and coast
wise trade. The largest buyers have been
the California Ship Company, Welch &
Co., Hind, Rolph & Co. and Alexander
& Baldwin. The California Ship Com
pany is now the largest owner of sailing
tonnage in the world, while Welch & Co.
run it a close second, and Hind, Rolph &
Co. control twenty vessels.
The latest additions to the coasting fleet
are the Tillie E. Starbuck, - Challenger
Emily Reed and Isaac Reed. The Star
buck was the first steel sailing vessel
built in the United States. Â£he is now
on her way from Honolulu to Philadel
phia with a cargo of sugar, and from
the Ciiy of Brotherly Love will come to
San Francisco with a general cargo. On
her arrival here she will be turned over
to Welch & Co. and a new captain will
take command.
The Challenger is now on her way from
New York to Honolulu, and on her ar
rival in Hawaii will come to San Fran
cisco. She has been purchased by Hind,
Rolph & Co, and Captain Piltz, late mas
ter of the barkentine William Carson,
will command her. *ne Carson was run
down and sunk by the steamer Claudine,

Dredging for gold, which may take on
large proportions in this State and also on
the Colorado River in Arizona, is popular
in Montana. The Gold Dredge Mining
Company has, according to the Mining
and Scientific Press, three miles of placer
ground on Grasshopper Creek, near Ban
nack. L. C. Bonney, manager, and M. Mc-
Donald, superintendent, say they have two
boats, costing about $50,uw each, working
about a mile apart, one operated by water
and electricity, the other by steam. Each
boat Is 102 by SÂ»J feet; the machinery on
each weighs 3","J tons. The booms from
which the dredge buckets or scoops work
have a sweep of about 300 feet, the width
of the paystreak along the creek. The
prade is 1 per cent. A email dam is suf
licient to hold water in check to float the
boats, and they make their own channel
and construct their own dam. Each boat
handles 2100 cubic yards of earth a day;
the pay averages 2"> cents a yard. It costs
VS>0 a day to run the dredges.
Work has been begun on the Red Cloud

The London Daily Mail furnishes some
interesting information concerning the

as follows:
"Everywhere is a Etrange silence, now
that the thud of the battery stamps and
the clatter of the hauling pear axe stilled.
ThÂ»; tailing heaps lie white as skeletons
upon the track, and the gaunt headgears
point bony fingers to the Fky. The Gol
coxida has become a Golgotha, ln which
rust and corruption are the only active
aj?Â«-ncies, and decay alone Is king-. At
long intervals a listless chimney floats a
smoky pennant to the sky as a sign that
thtre a privileged engineer Is fighting the
canker with his pumps. But the number
of these is small and wholly Inadequate
to dispel the general impression of a char
n<?l house. Wagon ways, deserted by their
supports, hang fantastically festooned
or draggle sluttishly across the heaps of
ore. In the shafts the water has reached
its level, and Is noiselessly, remorselessly
picking cut the pit supports and obliter
ating the existence of crosscuts. While
fu<-h is the scene presented to the passing
observer, to the mining expert little dam.

: new mimes for turning in the water. The
ly.ino Brothers, below Hamburgh, are also
j opening a cut to bedrock. The new
: dredger at ITawklnsvfllc. in Yreka Creek,
has been tested a number of times lately,
i and owing to the complicated arrange
ment of the several different sectionE, ope
rated by seven different steam engines,
much fixing may be necessary to get all in
smooth running order. It is almost ready,
â¢'however. 'and the scooping of the gravel
will be commenced almost any time.

Lady Cnurchlll's Wit.
Laar Randolph Churchill has inherited
the wit of her father. -Uncle Larry" Je
rome, as she demonstrated upon one oc
casion to an eminent British politician.
He was somewhat annoyed at the cam
paign she had made, and said: "I really
don't understand, madam, why or how It
is that American ladies refuse to enter
political life In their own country, but
overwhelm us here in England." "That
is because you never traveled In the
States. The men there are so Intelligent
and patriotic that they do not require the
eiTvices of our sex as an educating force."

The story of mining on Douglas Island.
Alaska, still reads like a fairy tale. Un
der one roof thexe are 3>X> stamps. Along
the east shore of the island are four more
etarr.p mills. The ore averages less than
$3 pÂ«r ton, and yet each claim is worked
&.t a. profit- There are now fc-yj stamps en
ti.e lode. The first mill built on the
Treaduell had Jive stamps. This was fol
l.>wt-d by one of 12J stamps. Then 120
stamps were added. Last year the 300
stAcap mill was finished ac<i the Treadwell
now has 540 stamps dropping on ore. The
S v-etamp mill takes twenty-three em
ployes to keep It running. That is only
one more employe than the 24J-stamp mill
has. The SOy-stamp mill has one foreman,
four amalgamators, eiÂ£ht feeders, four
concentrator men, one concentrator re
pairer, two oilers, two suiphuret pullers
and one man handling the kicker.
The mine, with rockbreakers on thÂ«
top floor, hoists ore ISjO feet distant from
the mill. Sixty self-feeders supply the
batteries with era. A stamp weights luiO
pounds and drcps 1C1 times a minute. An
â¢amalgamator is in charge of each tier
of 1m stamps, with two feeders as assist
ants. The mill is crushing 13J0 tons of ore
daily. The assay cf mill tailings on the
island runs usually from ID to 13 cents per
ton.
These are some cf many Interesting
statements made by Henry Watson, who
has written for the Aiiidnj; and Scieutilic
Press on the general subject. The crush-
Ing capacity of the new mill is illustrated
by the statement that S2,7-4,iX>0 pounds of
metal drop seven inches on the ore every
minute, and this greiit f^rce is used to
extract a meial invisible to the naked eye.
"une minute's dropping of eo many mil
lion pounds of iron."' t>a.ys Mr. Watson,
â¢Â¦proauces one-seventh of an ounce of
Cold, and even Uien one-third of this
value is la the concentrates, requiring
roytlng and smelting, betides a transpor
tation of fcj>j miles to the smelter."

Five Hundred Barrels of Beer Con
signed to the Islands Held Up

The bark Rosamonde was refused clear
ance for Hawaii yesterday morning, pend
ing advices from the Secretary of the
Treasury, there being on board 500 barrels
of beer and other merchandise on which
the United States internal revenue tax
had not been paid. Later in the day the
Secretary of the Treasury ordered thÂ©
bark released and will permit her owners,
Williams. Dimond & Co., to pay the In
ternal revenue tax at Honolulu.
The delay grew out of a circular recent
ly issued from the Department at Wash

14. 1000. articles subject to internal reve
nue taxation could not be exported from
the United States to the Territory of Ha
waii in bond without payment of tax, nor
with the benefit of drawback. After the
circular had been issued It was decided
that the date of export is the date of the
sailing of the vessel from the Pacific sea

HAWAIIANS ALMOST
LOST THEIR LAGER
Pathetic Letter From Mrs. Sarah
Goggin, Who Says She Was De
frauded of Property by
the Attorney.
Â» '
Captain of Detectives Seymour is still
engaged in gathering evidence against At
torney "Jack" Chretien in connection with
his alleged bold scheme to deal out places
on the police force for a monetary con
sideration. He expects to have enough
evidence in a few days to warrant him in
swearing to a warrant for the attorney's
arrest, charging him with felony.
Edward Darcy. the gripman who gave
Chretien a certificate of deposit for $500
on the understanding that the attorney
would have him appointed a member of
the force, will in all probability be called
as a witness against him. Notwithstand
ing Darcy's determined effort to shield
the attorney while he was testifying be
fore the Grand Jury, Captain Seymour Is
satisfied that he will tell the truth In
case Chretien is arrested.
Chretien Accused by a Woman.
In addition to the attempt to "beat"
the deluded gripman Captain Seymour is
Investigating another and more serious
crime which is charged to Chretien. It is
the alleged defrauding of Mrs. Sarah Gog
gin of a valuable piece of property at 1913
Van Ness avenue. Mrs. Goggin's husband
was the trusted employe of Francis,
Valentine & Co. and in an evil moment
he helped himself to the funds of the
firm. Fearing- arrest he went to Scot
land, where he was shortly afterward
joined by his wife.
The following letter, written by Mrs,
Goggln to Chief of Police Crowley some
time ago, shows how much she thought
of Chretien:
THE MALL, MOXTROSE, Scotland.
Chief Crowleyâ Dear Sir: My daughter had a
letter from Mr. Chretien yesterday. He said
you showed him my amusing letter and said
he was told you would not answer me. This I
would not believe him on his oath, for I know
you are too perfect a pontleman to speak like
that, and too clever an officer of Justice to
let such a daring robber pass you by, where
the English Consul had traced to Chretien as
being the person who produced the power of
attorney on an order from E. \V. GogBin to got
my private trunk, which was dlrectr-d to L)r.
, my son-in-law. In Scotland. The power
Is a forged power, as I never gave him such
power,- for I would not give him the power
ovrr my dog; and I mnde my daughter tell him
yesterday that I nave him no such power. 1
am writinsr Captain Lees by this post to see If
he can help in this matter. I told him what
Chretien Bald about my amusing letter, and
that you would not answer me. I also told
him I would not believe him under oath, for
that you had every fact of the case very clear
ly before you. and that you had the help of
the Enelieh Consul and Mr. Bowden, the Cus
tom-house broker who had charge of them.
I Inclose you another of the lists, feeling you
may want them. Hoping to hear a favorable
reply, yours truly,
BARAH W, GOGGIN.
Mrs. Goggin's Pathetic Appeal.
A few days later the police received an
other letter from Mrs. Goggln. It read as
follows:
I have seen by the newspapers where that
dreadful man, John Chretien, the eham lawyer
<if San Francisco, is Felling my house. 1913 Van
Ness avenue, the only means I have to live on,
leaving me a perfect beggar. Is there no way to
appoint me a State lawyer, an-1 not to have Mr.
Chretien mak<* away with my property with a
paper forged by him? When he got me 1 to kIkh
it he told me it was a letter, to help my friend,
Mrs. Reed, to draw my rents; and It was to
give himself the power; and he has robbed me
In a fearful way. even to my clothes. I am left
pcnnlk-fis by a swindler of a husband, and all
his plans were well carried out when he got me
out of California. Oh. can nothing be done for
a helpless woman without the means in her
power to go out and tell her true story to, the
world? I promise you Mr. Chretien would soon
be in Pan Quontin. His letters will prove what
a villain he if. He frot his wife to write me
lies to put me off my guard. Oh, for God's
sake help me. Yours In sorrow,
SARAH W GOGGIN. Â¦
P. S. â For God's sake lose no time.
To-day Captain Seymour Intends to find
out whether or not Chretien has posses
sion of the property referred to In Mrs.
Goggin's letter.
Daniel O'Connell 's Statement.
The police^ yesterday, obtained ajstate-
Will Be Arrested for Taking
Money From Would-Be
Policeman.
CHRETIEN TO
BE PROSECUTED
SAYS SEYMOUR
ment of Daniel O'Connell, a stockbroker
at 26 Montgomery street, in reference to
the attempt to "do" Gripman Darcy. In
it ho says that he introduced Kelly, who
was one of the conspirators, to Chretien
about six months ago.
Chretien, ho claimed, was a member
of the Republican County Committee and
hnd a "pull" with tho Police Commission
ers.
"I have never seen Darcy or Doran," he
continues. "Kelly, I understand, is in
Seattle, having suddenly disappeared on
account of some crooked deal. I met
Chretien last Thursday or Friday. He told
me that he had to refund the money he
got in the deal In which Kellv was inter
ested. I supposed that he referred to the
Darcy case." . ; . :
Kelly is still at large, but the police are
hopeful of effecting his capture. He will
then be used as a witness against Chre
tien, providing he tells all he knows about
the transaction Â¦with Darcy.
A PETITION was filed yesterday asking for the removal
of Dr. E. W. King, superintendent of the State Hospital
for the Insane at Ukiah, Mendocino County. Accompany
ing it are many charges against the aged head of the institu
tion. The document was filed with the board of managers
by Hon. T. L Carothers, who is one of the leading attorneys
of Ukiah and well known throughout the State. Incompe
tency, lack of medical skill, high-handed and dictatorial ,
methods, lack of ability to command respect of his subordi
nates, allowing private parties to feed horses at the expense
of the State and practicing his profession outside of the in
stitution are some of the allegations made against Dr. King.
The petition is the outcome of the discharge for alleged po
litical motives of the son of the petitioner, who was chief
engineer at the institution.
The chief carpenter also had been discharged by Dr.
King, and yesterday the physician produced a sensation
by summarily dismissing W. 6. Jones, steward of the hospi
tal, and giving his place to F. C. Handy, secretary to the
superintendent.
All these dismissals are said to have been made without
cause, and the discharged employes will make a legal battle
for reinstatement. The deposed chief engineer is represented
by his father and J. C. Ruddock, and Jones has retained ex-
Governor James H. Budd as" his counsel.
and want of harmony between the said board
of managers and the said medical superintend
ent.
Fifth â That the said medical superintendent
has used the employes of said asylum for busi
ness not connected with the State of California,
and while the s=aiil employes were so occupied
the MenOoeino State Hospital was deprived of
their services thereat.
Sixthâ That the said medical superintendent
has permitted his recretary to be offensively
officious in active participation in political mat
ters and in the management of the asylum and
the business pertainjng thereto and in the ap
pointment and discharge of employe*.
Seventh â That the said medical superintend
ent has permitted the absence, without the
knowledge or consent of thp board of man
agers of said Mendocino State Hospital, of
employes thereof.
Eighth â That the said medical superintendent
has permitted patients at the said Mendocino
State Hospital to become Intoxicated while
under his care, and he has connived in shield-
ing the parties responsible therefor, when he
had full knowledge of the same and the rules
governing the said hospital.
Ninth â That the said medical superintendent
has discriminated and does discriminate be
tween employes at said Mendocino State Hos
pital and favors some to the detriment of
others, thereby affecting the efficiency of the
services at said Mendocino State Hospital, and
imposes on certain employes tasks not pre
scribed as a duty of their position by the by
laws.
Tenth â That he practices medicine among
people not patients at said institution, or em
ployes thereof, contrary to the laws of the
State of California, in such cases made and
provided.
Eleventhâ That he has had quartered upon
the State of California, and fed at the expense
of said State, horses owned by private indi
viduals, and has charged the *ald State with
the expenses of shoeing the said horses; that
he has used employes of the State in caring
for eald horses, and has used State carriages
XC1TEMEXT is buzzing through
out the State Hospital for the In
sane at Ukiah, Mendocino County.
' ' Actions on the part of the aged
Superintendent; Dr. E. W. King, alleged
to be high handed and illegal and which
had plunztd the big Institution into a con
dition of turmoil, culminated yesterday
in the- Cling of charges against him by a
prominent attorney of Ukiah, who asks
that the Superintendent be removed from
his position. Incompetency because of
lack of executive ability and medical skill,
dictatorial, autocratic and self-opinionat
ed characteristics, lack of ability to hold
the confidence and respect of his subor
dinates, use of employes for business not
connected with the institution, permitting
his secretary to be offensively officious in
matters political, permitting patients to
become intoxicated, practicing h'is profes
sion outside the hospital, allowing a con
tractor to become indebted to the institu
tion and feeding at the expense of the
State horses belonging to private parties
are among the charges made against Dr.
King.
For some time there has been great dis
satisfaction expressed at Dr. King's man-
agenent of the institution. This broke
out into strong and* open criticism when
six weeks ago the superintendent sum
marily dismissed M. M. Carothers, chief
engineer of the hospital, and who had
been an employe there since the institu
tion was opened. Incompetency was al
leged, though the discharged engineer, it
is stated, was regarded by the official in
spectors and the managers as one of the
most competent employes of, the institu
tion. It is claimed that the chief engi
neer's discharge was brought about
through motives of political revenge on the
part of the superintendent's secretary.
I^ater on James George, the chief car
penter, was discharged by Dr. King, and
veÂ«terday the climax was reached when
\V G. June.', the steward of the institu
tion, was summarily dismissed by the
aged superintendent.
Charges Against Superintendent.
T. L.. Carothers, one of the leaders of
the legal profession in Ukiah and a man
who is -.veil known throughout the State,
having been a Presidential Elector in 3SSS
and a member up to a few years ago of the
board of directors of the institution in
question, is the author of the charges
against and the petition for the removal
of Superintendent King. The document
was riled with the board of managers of
the hospital yesterday, and is as follows:
To the Honorable Board of Managers of the
Mendocino State Hospital for the Insane: T. L.
Carothers, a'citizm and taxpayer of the State
of California, raiding in the State of Califor
nia, comes now and makes the following
charges against E. W. Klnp, the medical su
perintendent of the Mendocino State Hospital
for the Insane, and specifies as follows:
Firstâ That the said E. W. King ie now and
has been at all the times mentioned herein
medical superintendent of the Mendoc'.no State
Hospital for the Insane.
Secondâ That the said E. W. Kins is Incom
petent to perform the 'duties of his said office
of medical superintendent of said State Hospital
by reason of his lack of executive ability caused
I by his advanced age and loss of memory and
by reason of his lack of medical skill and abil
ity necessary to the treatment of the claps of
i patients contained In said llendocino State
I Hospital.
Thirdâ That the Eald E. "W. King is dicta-
I torial. autocratic and self-opinionated to such
I an extent that he .lias neither the confidence nor
rppjrf-ct of the officers cr employes of the iJid
Mfn<iocino State Hospital, thereby affecting the
efficiency of the said Institution and the satis
factory services of puch officers and employes.
Fourthâ That by reason of the said character
istic last mentioned of the said E. W. King,
' medical superintendent as aforesaid, he dees
i not fellow the wishes and Judgment of the
b^ard of managers of eald Mendocino State
I Hospital, and sets up his own desires and opin
ions in opposition thereto, and insists upon the
! same in an offensive manner, causing discord
for the entertainment and pleasure of his rela
tives and private guests and persons not of-
Ilclally connected with said institution.
Twelfthâ That he has fed and quartered the
horses belonging to employes of the said in
stitution at the expense of the State of Cali
fornia, contrary to law.
Thirteenthâ That he permitted one Chambers,
who was a contractor for furnishine milk to
said institution, to become indebted to said in
stitution for hay grown on the farm connected
with said State hospital, when said Chambers
was a creditor of said State, and the money
due from said Chambers to the State could eas
ily have been collected, and whereby the State
of California suffered loss.
Wherefore the said petitioner prays that by
the order of the said board of managers of
the Jlendocino State Hospital for the Insane,
the said E. W. Kingr, medical superintendent
thereof, be removed from his said position.
T. L. CAItOTIIEItS. Petitioner.
Handy's Political Conniving.
Chief Engineer Carnthers protested
against his dismissal, but Dr. King, dom
inated as he is said to have been by his
private secretary, F. C. Handy, who for
political reasons wished to revenge him
self upon Hon. T. L. Carothers, the peti
tioner and who is also the father of the
deposed engineer, had promised the posi
tion to E. S. Johnson, a young gentleman
from Albion. Johnson had rendered ef
ficient aid to what is known in Ukiah as
the Duncan-Handy push in the election of
189S, and to reward him for his work he
had been promised the place. A year ago
Johnson came to Ukiah to take the posi
tion, but Handy was not then in a posi
tion to discharge Carothers. About three
months ago Governor Gage appointed two
new members of the board of managers,
which made the body Republican. Then
Mr. Handy thought his time had come,
and the superintendent promptly notified
Carothers that his services were no longer
required.
The majority of the board, of which A.
W. Foster, president of the California
Northwestern Railway, is president, re
quested Superintendent King to reinstate
Mr. Carothers until such t ma as the board
should investigate the charges preferred.
The superintendent, however, declined,
and then Attorneys J. C. Ruddook an.l
T. L. Carothers appeared before the board
to present their side of the case for the
engineer. In the meantime the chief car
penter, James George, had also been dis
charged without cause. He alsi employed
counsel and will protest to the board.
Yesterday Dr. King's peculiar character
istics were again shown by his discharge
of W. G. Jones, the steward, who, he al
leges, is insubordinate. This position was
given to Handy, who. it is alleged, has
been working for the place for a long time.
The asylum employes are therefore in a
very excited condition, and the day's
events have produced a sensation in
Ukiah. Ex-Governor Cudd has been em
ployed by Mr. Jones to represent him.
There is on file in the County Clerk's
office in Ukiah a claim by Dr. Kins
against the estate of Joseph Elledse, do
ceased, for a lar^e sum, claimed to be due
for medical services rendered by the phy
sician.
He Summarily Dismisses Engineer, Steward and
Carpenter and Hon. T. L. Carothers Prefers
Many Charges Against Him.

Â¦WASHINGTON, Jure 16.â The action of
the health authorities In making renewed
efforts to prevent persons who may have
been exposed to the plague from leaving
San Francisco and California is ex
plained by the following dispatch from
Surgeon Kinyoun at San Francisco, the
dispatch having been received by the Sur
geon General of the Marine Hospital Ser
vice June 14:
"If the Federal court orders the aban
donment of the Health Board cordons
about Chinatown, thereby permitting per
sons from infected districts to travel from
the city, I will, unless otherwise directed,
enforce the regulations of May 22 against
persons leaving San Francisco for other
States. I will instruct common carriers
to refuse transportation to all persons de
siring to leave San Francisco to go to
other States unless having a certificate
of a marine hospital officer. I will re
inforce guards at State lines and also no
tify the Health Boards of all surrounding
States of the actual conditions existing
here."
The order of May 22 was based upon a
report sent by the Surgeon General to the j
Secretary cf the Treasury, m which he
enclosed a memorandum showing the ex
istence of the bubonic plague In China
town, in San Francisco. He then refju*.-st
ed the promulgation of such regulations
as might be necessary to prevent the
spread of the disease from one State or
Territory to another.
"Dhese regulations provided that "no
common carrier shall accept for transpor
tation any person suffering with plague
or any article infected therewith, nor shall
common carriers accept for transporta
tion any class of persons who may be des
ignated by the Surgeon General of the
Marine Hospital Service as being likely to
convey the risk cf plague contagion to
other communities and said common car
riers shall be subject to inspection."
This order was originally directed
against Asiatics, but since it has been
found that no discrimination can be al
lowed all persons are subject to the regu
lations. The Inspection service has been
in operation since May 22. the date of the
order, but as Chinatown was surrounded
by a health cordon it was unnecessary to
carry out its provisions in their entirety.
The cordon having, been removed, how
ever, stricter precautions are to be taken
YTMA. Ariz.. June 16.â Dr. Mitchell
sanitary inspector at this point, has re
ceived instructions from the marine board
in San Francisco to allow no passengers
from San Francisco to pass the State line
into the Territory of Arizona unless ac
companied by a certificate signed by a
Marine Hospital officer.
NEEDLES: June 15. â A quarantine has
been established here, and no person will
be permitted to leave California unless
provided with a certificate. The inspector
will be stationed at Blake, a station on
the Santa Fe route at the Arizona and

CONFUSION ON
THE WATER FRONT
Dr. Kinyoun was the busiest man on the
front yesterday. His edict brought hun
dreds of people to the new ferry depot
and about 4 p. m. thore was hardly pas
sageway in the grand nave.
The quarantine officer issued his orders
not only to the railroad companies and the
mail steams-hip lines, but the local steam
ers were also notified that every passen
ger must have a certificate Issued by the
United States Quarantine- Onice before
they could leave the city. To-day the
steamer Orizaba leaves for Eureka, and

WATSON VILLE IS FREE
FROM TAINT OF PLAGUE
WATSOXVILLE. June 15.â The news that the State had been quar
antined on account of the discovery of a bubonic plague case in
this city was indeed a surprise to the people and particularly to
the physicians of this city. Dr. B. J. Lloyd, representing United
States Quarantine Officer Kinyoun. came quietly to Watsonvilie last
Wednesday. The first physician he visited was Dr. Guy Miller, who intro
duced him to Dr. P. K. Waters, who has the principal Chinese and Japan
ese practice here. The latter took Dr. Lloyd to Brooklyn, across the river,
where the Chinese and Japanese live, and showed -him the residents. There
Â¦was only one case of sickness there at the time and that was a woman who
was suffering from a simple complaint.
Dr. Waters informed Dr. Lloyd that there had been' only one death in
Chinatown in the last six weeks. Dr. Lloyd on the conclusion of his visit
congratulated the people, here on the cleanliness of the Mongolian section
and reported to Drs. Waters and Mitler that there was no sign of plague
here in any form. Chinatown here is owned by the John T. Porter estate.
and it has always been the boast of the owners and the people that there
were not more modern and up-to-date Mongolian quarters in the State. A
few of the leading physicians were interviewed at a late hour here to-night
and reported as follows:
Dr. S. C. Rodgersâ It Is simply ridiculous. There is not now and never has
been a case of plague in this city. It is the rankest kind of a slander and a
falsehood.
Dr. P. K. Watersâ I took Dr. Lloyd, the United States Health Officer,
through Chinatown. We made a thorough inspection and I showed him the
only case of sickness there. He emphatically said there were no signs of
plague here and congratulated us on the new and. clean Chinatown. In my
opinion, the charge that a case of plague exists here is absolutely false.
Dr. Guy Miller â Dr. LJoyd called on me Wednesday, and I referred him to
Dr. Waters. After having visited Chinatown with Dr. Waters he called on me
again before leaving and said there was no case of plague In Chinatown; there
was only one person sick there, and that was a woman who was suffering
from a simple complaint. He found Chinatown's condition first class. In my
opinion, the charge is false.

PEOPLE OF THE
SOUTH SUFFER
LOS ANGELES. June li-The following
telegram was received to-day by Dr. Pow
ers: "Federal Court dissolves quarantine
imposed by local Board of Health on Chi
nese district. On account of eleven deaths
from plague, occurring from March 7 to
June 2, would suggest precautionary
measures be instituted against all persons
coming 1 from infected district. Have no
tified common carriers under the law cf
1SS0 to refuse transportation to all persons
leaving San Francisco for other States' un
less provided with certificates signed by
Marine Hospital officer."
When the Federal order wa3 received
by Los Angeles railroad officials they were
dumfounded. the general majiager decid
ing to await results. If the quarantine is
enforced at Yuma the people will fee
dumped on the Colorado desert in Cali
fornia west of the river without a roof
for shelter, a bed or a, meal.
Â£1 Paso has issued orders that every
one must be out of the infected district
fifteen days before they can pass the
State line. Colorado has quarantined
against all San Frar.clsco Chinese. Lead
ins citizens of Los Angeles are unanimous
in the opinion that if the plague does ex
ist all towns should protect themselves,
and if not the persons who are engineer

State should be bitterly denounced.

The other two passengers are taking

People here consider that the quaran
tine is an unwarranted outrage upon the
people of Calffornia. The following is the
message received by Sanitary Inspector
McQuesten from Dr. Kinyoun:
"Federal officers ordered raising of
quarantine. Do not allow passengers to
cross State line without certificate from

TRAVELERS TAKEN
FROM A TRAIN
TRITCKEE. June 16.â Considerable ex

when passenger train No. 4 arrived. San

clearance from the chief sur
geon of the marine hospital corp3. Mrs.
Peace, an elderly lady, who la In poor
health, accompanied by her son, C. H.
Peace, were two of the passengers "re
moved from the train. .Mrs. Peace was
nearly overcome by the unusual excite-
ceived their certificates, others know
nothing about the order. There will con
sequently be considerable confusion when
the steamer is about to sail this morn:ng.
tariy yesteraay morning tne man
steamship lines posted notices that no
passengers would be carried. The Pacific

quarantining of the State by Dr. Kinyoun,
United States District Attorney H, L.
Ccornb:* said: "As to the advice I gave
Dr. Kinyoun regarding the quarantine I
cannot divulge. That is a secret and must
be had from others. I will say. however,
that the quarantine was established with
out my knowledge. Dr. Kinyoun quaran
tined the State without asking my advice.
I gave him advice over the plague often,
however, when Governor Gage was in the
room. You must go to the Governor for
anything concerning that advice. I am
not at liberty to state -what it was. If I
should do so my department would hold
me responsible.
"With regard to the deputizing: cf the
inspectors of the Federal authorities,
again I cannot say anything. You, of
course know that the inspectors were not
made deputies. The Marshal has that
matter in charge and will give you any in
formation he sees lit. I cannot talk and

must seek Governor Gage and the Mar
shal for news."

Dr. J. J. Kinyoun Strikes a Serious Blow to the State by Arbitrarily
and Without Cause Placing It Under Federal Quarantine.
A danger existed, and to prove
tnat the city is not infected.
When success seemed about to
reward these efforts, when ex
perienced and capable experts
had announced that the piague
is not here, when the Federal
Judges, convinced that a se
rious injury had been done
to California and that the quar
antine in Chinatown should be
raised, Dr. Kinyoun stepped in
and by the exercise of arbitrary
and insolent power quarantined
the State.
He witl give no reason for his
extraordinary action. He offers
nothing to support his gross and
unparalleled injury to the State.
He has permitted to float from
his office a rumor that p!2gue had
been discovered at Watsonvilie.
Inquiry has demonstrated that
the rumGr was an outrageous
falsehood. This condition of af
fairs has excited the people of
the State to a pitch of indigna
tion. Irreparable injury is threat
ened to the industries of the
State. Traffic is demoralized,
passengers are being stopped at
the borders by the agents of the
autocratic Kinyoun, and demoral
ization has settled upon the chief
cities of the State.
Citizens, with a common im
pulse, are appealing to President
As far as any investigation can
prove this action of Dr. Kinyoun
is utterly without warrant. Every
responsible investigator declares
that if the bubonic piague ever
was in San Francisco it is not
here now, and there is abso
lutely nothing to suggest that it
is anywhere else in California.
The people of San Francisco
were using every endeavor to still
apprehension, to convince the
outside world that every neces
sary precaution had been taken
that the most drastic measures
are necessary to prevent the
spread of the bubonic pElgue in
this State.
DR. J. J. KINYOUN, Federal
quarantine officer at this
port has struck a serious blow
at the prosperity of California.
Abusing the autocratic powers
of his position and without-a care
for the consequences of his ex
travagant action, he has placed
the State under quarantine. He
has paralyzed traffic, made the
State an object of fear to the
Union- jeopardizing every finan
cial and industrial interest in
California* and proclaimed to the
world the dangerous falsehood
SAN FRANCISCO, June 16, 1900.
To President McKinley, Washington, D. C.
In accordance with the law of March 27, 1890, and
the regulations thereunder promulgated by you May 21,
1900, the United States Quarantine Officer for San Fran
cisco, in defiance of the decision of the Federal Court that
there is not now and never has been any bubonic plague in
this State, has quarantined the entire State of California.
Under this order no passenger can leave the State by ship
or rail without special certificate from the Quarantine Offi
cer. The indignation of the people of California is beyond
expression. They protest fn the strongest terms against
this most unjust and unwarranted order, and ask that you
at once direct its immediate revocation. Your action in
this regard is of vital importance.

Sargp^n 11. H. S.. Quarantine Officer.
The operation of the State quarantine
began yesterday morning. Up to a late
hcur fn the afternoon ticket sellers at the
ferry refused to sell tickets for points
within this State unless the purchaser pre
sented a certificate of health from the
United States quarantine officer. As late as
3 o'clock in the afternoon quarantine in
spectors, en being- asked whether it was
necessary to obtain a certificate to go to
some point within the boundaries of this
State, replied that it would be safer to
have a certificate than to be without one. !
Later than that hour the inspectors Issued
certificates for interior points without ;
notifying the passenger that such certi- i
Scate was not necessary. One of these !
certificates was giver, for Treka and an- |
other for Fresno. Four inspectors were i
kept busy a!l the day in the Quarantine
OfSee in the ferry depot building issuing
the certificates.
The only questions asked of the ap- !
j plicants were the following: "What is |
I your name? Wl-ere were you born? Your !
(ape? Your height? Distinguishing marks,,-]
if any? Where is your residence? Where:
! are you coins? When are you point? to j
j ?tart? How mar.y pieces of baggage have !
you?" The applicant is then requested to I
J indorse the certificate, after which it is !
signed and stamped with the seal of the j
quarantine office. The certificate contains 'j
answers to all the foregoing questions ex- !
cept as to the piace of destination and the |
time of departure. No questions are asked i
as to whether the applicant has been in !
Chinatown or ha? been exposed to the bu- '
bonic plague or any other contagious dis
ease or whether he has contracted a con- !
I taeicus disease.
United States Marshal Shine said yester- ;
day. in discussing the matter, that last |
May when Dr. Kinyoun established a !
quarantine on all Asiatics leaving this
city he called upon Marshal Shine and i
requested the Marshal to appoint as Dep- ;
uty United States Marshals the quarantine !
Inspectors to be designated by Dr. Kin- j
I youn. Mr. Shine refused. Last Thurs- 1
day. the day before United States Circuit !
Judge Morrow rendered his opinion that
Che quarantine was illegal and uncalled !
for. Dr. Kinyoun repeated his request of 1
the Marshal, and the Marshal again re- !
fused.
Ucited States District Attorney Coombs
said that' he advised Dr. Kinyoun yester- j
'< day to raise the quarantine â that* he was j
doing wrong in putting it on after the de
cision of Judge Morrow. In the cor.Nmpt !
proceedings to-morrow morning it will bÂ« ]
Mr. Coombs' duty to appear in defense j
of Dr. Kinyoun in his capacity as a Fed- J
eral official, and his duty will require him

Judge Morrow was visited in his cham

Randolph Bercns of the great Churchill
line, the man who was "easy money" for
Bunko Steerer "Kid" Brown at the Pal
ace Hotel FVlday afternoon, went to the
baseball game yesterday at Recreation
Park. His judgment was that the Dudes
were "nice young fellows, don't you know,
but they can'tâ really they can't, you
know â get any of my money."
Bcrens learned his American poker in
Spain and drank of the fount of baseball
somewhere in the Orient, yet he knew
this time that no game was being played
upon him. It was so slow and full of
everything but life and action. "Ah, why
don't they move? It's not like cricket,
not a bit," he Bald very loud and strong.
When told that Oakland's team was com
posed of nine Brummels, he agreed, say
ing:
"That is It, but they really are not men
of fashion, are they?
Borchers twirled for Oakland and the
Millers found him eight times, most of
ths hits coming in the last part of the
game. Whalen was a bit too strong for
the Dudes, who could not untwist his
curves. The one feature of the game waa
a pretty catch by Lockhead, who ascend
ed to the skiog and pulled down a hot one
that was meant for left Held. â¢
The Dudes demonstrated that they were
not tucked under the covers in the lirst
inning. Drennan walked to the first sack,
advancing to second on a passed ball and
third on Lanije's out. Then came the
premier bntsman of the league, Hutchin
son, who swatted the ball for a three
bagger, scoring Drennan. After Moskl
man's out Hutchinson crossed the plate
on Franck's hit. Dunleavy's out retired
the side.
Not until the flfth did the Millers get a
man over the plate. With Courtney gone.
Morrow surprised even the Oakland mas
cot by rolling the ball out to the flag
pole and throe packs was his portion. On
Whalen's out Morrow scored.
In the seventh the Millers came to and
shot a couple of men over the plate be
causo Oakland's -untouchable outfield for
got to gum their hands. Moore drove a
long one to Moskimun, who failed to sticlc
to the ball, .and Courtney, next up. sent
one to far center, which fell out of t)ren
nan's right hand, Moore going -to third.
Un Morrow\s hit along the third sack line
both men scored. Then came the three
outs that sent Stockton to the field.
The last of the seventh warmed up a
bit. Three Dudes crowded the sacks for
a time, but that was all there was to it.
They froze and played monuments.
Stockton did a bit of stick work In the
eighth, and It was all over for the Dudea.
Babbitt swatted a hard one to Dunleavy,
who dropped the ball after a hard run.
Hahbltt made second on the play, scoring
on Lockhead's single, who in turn ecorea
on Pace's single. Pace rounded the bags,
making the third run.
In the ninth Morrow added another run
for Stockton. The score:

OAKLAND LOSES
TO STOCKTON IN
A SLOW CONTEST
Judge Murasky dealt a facer to thÂ» pool
rooms in a decision rendered yesterday in
which he declares that they are places
which are a detriment to public morals.
His decision was on a demurrer of the
city to the suit of Harry E. Corbett, who
wished to have an injunction granted that
would restrain the city from arresting
him for keeping his poolrooms open. The
city demurred to the complaint, and it
-was agreed that the case should be de
cided upon the demurrer. The demurrer
was sustained, which means that Corbett
has lost his suit
In rendering Judgment Judge Murasky
makes a pejint of the difference between
public policy and public morals. He says:
PoolBelling and bookmaking involve betting.
In many States all kind3 of wagering are pro
hibited, but not so In California. By the com
mon law, which governs us when the statutes
do not apply, only those wagers which involved
a breach of the peace or were in their nature
against public policyâ such as bets upon elec
tions, upon the price of food or upon the judg
ment of a courtâ were Invalid, and all others
were legal and recoverable at law. The Su
preme Court adopted this rule, and by its de
cisions Certain classes of wagers were recog
nized as valid. Johnston vs. Russell. 37 Cali
fornia, 670. In Gridley vs. Dorn, 57 California,
which is the last utterance of the Supreme
Court directly upon the subject, the cuurt,
while expressing its belief that all wagering
was against sound policy and therefore void,
recognized the existence of the rule laid* down
In -Johnston vs. Ruesell.
But while some waserlns may not be against
public policy or even against good morals, It
cannot be said that the practice of wagering
cr the maintenance of a place where wagering
may evolve from a paetlme into an occupation.
Is in conformity with good morals., That this
Is bo la apparent from the policy of the com
mon law, which legalized gaming, but con
demned excessive wagering and prohibited pub
lic earning houses. It is the Continuous in
dulgence in wagering that is contrary to good
morals. "At common law gambling in and of
Itself was not a nuisance, but became so when
accompanied by incidents tending to the dis
comfort, disorder or demoralization of society."
Kwlgart vs. the People, 154 111., 296. Among
those incidents was gambling publicly and ex
cessively. In the same case It was held that
the mere gathering of people about the betting
rooms of the Garfleld Park Club waa demoral
izing. It la true that poolselllng was forbidden
by law In Illinois, but the languag* is used
without reference to the statute.
The court Is compelled to find that the main
tenance of a place wherein wagering- may be
constantly Indulged In, no matter how inno
cent the events upon which the wagers ara
laid, nor how Innocent the bets In themselves
may be, Is against good morals, as the phrasa
Is used in section 1667. k as It was against the
sound policy of the common law.
While bookmaking and poolselllng are not
gambling as denned by law, nor the mainten
ance of a bookmaklng business prohibited, I
am compelled to find that the recitals In plain
tiff's bill bring him within the provisions "of
subdivision 3 of section 1667 of the Civil Code,
and that under those circumstances he Is not
entitled to relief In a court of equity, but must
obtain whatever redress he may at law.
He Declares That They Are
Against Public Morals
and Policy.

Good start. Won ridden out; place the same. Winner, bay horÂ«e by Islington-Songstress.
Ethelbert was In a bad pocket to the last quarter. Imp and Beraud ran each other into
the trround.
FOF^/W OF THE SUBURBAN.
Jean Beraud a neck' in front of Imp and
Imp but a neck In front of Kinley Mack,
which was a half length ahead of Gulden.
Ethelbert still loped along, three lengths
back, although the time was three sec
onds slower than that made In the match
race with Jean Beraud only a short while
ago.
Around the upper turn they went, no
change being made In the pace. Thir
teen seconds more ticked off on the tlm.
ers' watch before the seven-furlong pole*
was passed. Imp was faltering; so waa
Jean Beraud. but the neck he had over
Imp was now a length. McCue then came
sailing along with Kinley Mack. Turner
noticed it, dug his heels Into the quiver
ing flanks of Jean Beraud. and the gal
lant son of His Highness responded Jo the
best of his ability. He did nobly for a
few seconds and then again began to fall
back. He soon Joined Imp, which also
had about enough of the race.
Aa the horses rounded the upper turn
and sailed into the short straight Kinley
Mack was In front,' a length to the good
over Jean Beraud, while the three-year
old Gulden was looming up dangerously
close, having passed Imp. The black
mare was falling back upon Ethelbert,
whose rider, Maher, had at last urged
him along into flfth place. It was a little
late for the move, but there were hopes
in the minds of those who had pinned
their faith to the Belmont horse that he
might still land the rich stake. The turn
was passed and the ludges stand was In
sight. Kinley Mack was swinging along,
not In the least bit of a hurry. Jean Be-'
raud was spent completely and dropped
back toward the rear. Imp was hang
ing on to fourth place and to Ethelbert.
Ethelbert's Gallant Struggle.
Like a whirlwind Ethelbert was coming
through the stretch. Maher was digging
in his heels In a frantic effort to make up
ths immense amount of ground he had
lost during the first mile of his Journey,
and shouts of encouragement were roared
at him from the crowd. The Belmont en
try was eating up the ground in great
bounds as he seemed to fairly fly through
the stretch. First Imp was met and
passed as If she were standing still. Then
there was Gulden to reckon with, and the
three-year-old looked as If he was an
chored, so fast did Ethelbert leave him in
the rear. Now there was a furlong to
go and the great crowd began to shout
â¢'Ethelbert!" as if to help the gallant
thoroughbred along. There was no use
.for Maher to spur or flog him. The horse
knew what was wanted of him, and, rfST
if In resentment of the pull on him during
the early part of the race, he gathered
himself together, dug his toes into the
yielding earth and seemed fairly to crouch
and spring with each space-devouring
stride.
It ,was heart-breaking to see that gal
lant? thoroughbred, with fire In his eyes,
his red nostrils flaring and his heart beat-
Ing hard with every stride, doing his best
to overtake KInley Mack, but it was a
hopeless task. Foot by foot he cut down
the great lead, but the distance was too
short, and as they rushed pa3t the wire
Kinley Mack was the victor by a length
and a half over Ethelbert, having run the
last quarter in 25 3-5 seconds. EthelbÂ«rt
made a marvelous race at the last.
McCue waa hoisted Into the floral
Jockey's chair and the vast crowd
cheered, and then a majority of the people
melted away like magic, for most of them
had come down only for the Suburban.

N- EW YORK. Juno 16.â With a good
track under him and a fine sky
1 above KInley Mack, with McCue
up, took the $10,000 Suburban han
dicap away from the great Ethel
bert to-day at Sneepshead Bay by a
length and a half. Ethelbert was pun
ished hard all the way through the
stretch, but could do no better than get
second place, while Gulden ran third and
Imp and Jean Beraud trailed home in
the ruck.
There waa an enormous crowd at the
track. The horses paraded past the grand
stand to the post soon after 4 o'clock and
â¢; were promptly lined up in front of the
i barrier, ready for the start. Two false
i breaks were made- in the first ten min
; utea, but about five minutes later the
â¢ starter caught the horses all In line and
j sent them away together.
They went thundering down the stretch
j for the first time with Imp leading, Jean
Beraud in second plact, KInley Mr.ck third
i and Ethelbert fourth, but dropping back
i and' not seeming to care for the position
i he had drawn against the rail: Before
they had completed the lower turn Jean
Beraud poked his head In front of Imp
and they wore running as a pair a length
In front of Kinley Mack, which was in
turn a length to the better of Gulden. The
i great Ethelbert was slowly dropping back
1 and soon took seventh place.
Inch by Inch, foot by foot, Jean Beraud
I slowly slipped away from the others, and
when a half mile had been covered the
pride of the Whitney string had a length
j the better of It In 49Vi seconds, and It sur
! prised the crowd to see the ileet Ethelbert
i away back in the ruck. Next to Jean Be
i raud came the grand mare Imp, with only
a head the advantage over Kinley Mack,
the Brooklyn handicap winner, which waa
hanging on like grim death in spite of the
fact that everybody thought he could run
only In the mud. Gulden was still in
fourth place and the others close up.
Haher Overconfident.
Maher still laid back, though It took
thirteen seconds to run the next furlong,
and ail but Ethelbcrt were beginning to
draw nearer to the leader. Jean Be
raud's margin began to get smaller and
smaller as horses and jockeys tried to get
closer to the leader. They went past the
five-furlong post as If they were in for a
four-mile race instead of a short mile and
a quarter. Thirteen seconds more and the
Eix-furlong pole was reached In 1:15, with

The appointment of Colonel J. F. Burgln
to the position of assistant adjutant gen
eral on the staff of the Second Brigade,
the appointee not .being a member of the

tary men capable of filling the olflce â are
there none competent within the bri
gade?" The Question has not been an
swered, but the comments are various.

The flrft round of a . lTS-dog reserve
itake was decided yesterday at Uttlon
CourFlng Park as a curtain-raiser to the
ladies' day championship meeting- to be
run to-day under the patronage of the
Interstate Courting Club. The sport yes
terday was lirst class, the hares being
ileet enough to take the majority of the
prÂ« yhounds clear across the Held. It was
essentially a favorites' day, there being
hardly enough upsets to maie the talent
cautious. In a number of courses they
effered big odds and barely escaped losing
their bets. They offered W to 1 on Metal
lic against Clover. The latter led and
was tx*aten only by the margin which
went with the kill. The moat notable in
t-uurre of lalte odds was the defeat of
Curtis & AioKinley by Sisquo.c, at
odds of 6 to 1. "Jimmy"' Dean was dis
cocsolate, as he did not think Siiquoc.
which he trains, had a chance, and did
not bet a cent on the outcome of the
course.
Jimmie Anthony beat Beauty Spot at
6 to 1; Nellie Uawn beat Wandering Tom,
4 to 1; Shadow beat Lady Clare, 2 to 1,
and Koyal Union beat Had Hoy, 2 to 1.
Flying Fox is the btake favorite, ltoyal

lik-h as the reserve stake Is In possibili
ties lo-day, it is but secondary to the
champion Itake. The consensus of opinion
umuut; the coursing rnen Â¦> is that
Beacon will surely make his way
mt j the tinal. as the best dugs
aiv in the lower half of the stake,
while he is in the upper half. While the
crack dogs at the bottom of the card are
i>laving havoc one with ajiother licacon
will t-e called upon to meet dogs which it
is conceded he can defeat. Thus he meets
Jl.tx.hels l'ride in the lirst round; prob
ably Theron in the second and Fine Fire
in the third. This would place him in the
lmal and under the red liatj. PaJo Alto,
his most dangerous rival, must men
Koyal Flush; tlu-a probably Narcissus In
the second rouud and Luxur or Warship
Infore he enters the T.nal. If he dashes
in on his game he should win. but any
hesitation on his paxt will bring defeat
from ltoyal Flush or any of the dogs he
must nii-<i.
The prices laid against the does in the
long-odds book are: Beacon, 2 to 1; Palo

TAKES THE ST.
LOUIS DERBY
Schorr's Gallant Colt Wins
Galloping by Three
Lengths.
ST. LOUIS, June 16.â Amid the plaudits
of 25,000 enthusiastic spectators Sam Phil
lips, the gallant son of St. Florian anil
Reckon, flashed under the imaginary line,
winner of the St. Louis Derby this after
noon. The day was proclaimed a half
holiday by the Mayor, and the Innovation
of a free infield by the Fair Association
attracted to the course an assemblage of
race-goers heretofore unrivaled In num
bers and enthusiasm. The commodious
betting ring was densely packed, ami It
was with the greatest difficulty that bet
tors placed money on their favorites.
The weather was perfect and the track
very fast.
The Scroggan entry, Florizar and High
land Lad, and Wounded Knee and Sam
Phillips were installed equal favorites at
5 to 2, and all received a tremendous play.
I To a good start Wounded Knee was
first to show. Passing the judges' stand
Wounded Knee was a neck In front of
Highland Lad, which led Dr. Cave by a
! head, all the others being within striking
distance. In the run down the back
i stretch Florizar assumed command, but
only momentarily, for Tommy Burns
shook up Sam Phillips and he shot to the
front. At the mile and a quarter Phillips
was two open lengths in front of Flori
zar, and the latter had a length the ad
vantage of Star Chamber, which Devin
had brought up from fifth position. Sam
Phillips came into the stretch a length
before Star - Chamber, ho four lengths
ahead of Florizar.
From this point the race became a pro
cession, Sam Phillips winning In a gallop
by three lengths from Star Chamber,
which In turn beat Florizar four lengths
for the place. Wounded Knee staggered
In four lengths behind Florizar. The race
was worth $10,000 to the winner. â¢
Sara Phillips, owned by a stable which
always contains an equine king In its
roster, has done everything that has been
asked of him this year. In the Club Mem
bers' handicap he ran a mile and a quar
ter In 2:08, after picking none the best
going, and that, too, carrying three
pounds above hla weight for age. He was
conceding aa good a horse as Pink Coat
nine pounds, and ran him to a head. The
colt is in the hands of one of the most
capable trainers In America, George
Walker. Year after year the Schorrs have
turned untried yearling^ over to this care
ful handler and each year has found the
Schorr contingent strong factors in the
two-year-old events. Walker's methods
are worthy of emulation. He cannot be
made to start a horsa until he is ready
to race and when he sends one to the
post he is always worthy of careful con
sideration. John F. Schorr, the owner of
the colt, is probably the youngest ov,-ntr
In America. He has fairly grown up with
horses, having been in his younger days
a jockey of no mean ability. He was one
of the most successful owners racing on
the San Francisco tracks last winter. Re

I Best for the Bowels m Icjfft LAMEDA, June 16.-Ten-year-old
Â¦1-3, Albert Davis committed suicide
JJ this afternoon by deliberately leap
ing from a beat into the waters of
San Leandro Bay with all his clothe? on
tr.d f-ghtlag the attempts of his boy com
panion to save him.
Inveterate smoking had aJTected the
bey's luags and he suffered frequent hem
Â©rrhages. The belief that he was afflicted
Â¦with cancer rrs.de him despondent, and
this fact gives color to the theory that he
cirr.rr.itt.ei suicsce while tn a f.t cf melan
cholia.
Davis and a companion of his cwn age.
Gus Lane, started for the High-street
tridge just after the noon hour. On the
way Davis picked up a cigar, which he
J?repare3 to smoke. His companion play
fully tock it frcrn him after it had been
hsJf-smcked and threw !t away. Davis
became piqued over the act and refused
to talk. "When the la-Os reached the
fcrid^e Davis insisted on going out In a
boat en the buy. Lane demurred, but
Davis shoved him Into a skiff they found
ar.d pushed off.
There was only one oar In the skiff.
This Davig -^ted as a soull. When the
boys were about fifty yards off shore and
midway between the railroad trestle and
the High-street bridge Davis was sud
denly seized with a hemorrhage. Blood
t-purted from his nose and rnotitb. He
leaned on the gu-waJe so the fo!ood would
not <3rcp Into the boat. The list allowed
the water to come in. and Lane shouttd
to his companion to be careful. For an-
Fwr-r Davis stood vp and made as if to
lear> overboard.
"My cancer hurts rne." cried the boy.

( en ? Â¦Â» his clothing, but the latter struck
I at hi . and he was compelled finally to let
go fox 'ear of being pulled into the water
: himself. Lane held out the slnp'e oar to
i the snuggling bey. but Davis pushed it
i away from him. refusing to grasp it,
Â¦ though it was within easy reach. Davis
could not swim and made no attempt to
Â¦ save himseif. He went down three times.
i Just before going down for the last time
: he shouted. "â¢Good-by."
"I did all I could to save him." said
i young Lane. "The tide took the skiff from
him. but I kept sculling it up near him
i end tried to make him take the oar. He
: said he -would ew!m ashore, but I knew
; he couldn't swim. He had all his clothes
' en. I found his cap and brought it home.
: He wouldn't talk after I took the cigar
; from him. and I think that for that reason
and that the blood came so fast from his
' lungs he became despondent. He acted
Â¦ very strangely all the time. While he
was in the water the blood kept coming
i from his mouth and making everything
red.
'Â¦ "When he shouted "Good-by." Just before
i he went down for the last time, he didn't
; seem to be scared at all. He seemed to
i be willing to die. I sculled ashore after
: the last time I saw him and told the own
i er of the boat what had happened."
Young Davis was a. son of Mr. and Mr*.
Samuel W. Davis of 1364 Broadway. They
'Â¦ cannot believe that their son took his life
Intentionally, although thev admit that at
; times he became despondent over his
poor health and complained of having a
1 cancer in hJs chest. He smoked almost
incessantly and his teachers frequently
: remonstrated with him.
Bridjretender Ralph Hanilin of the Bay-
Farm bridge sent out a boat armed with
! grappling hooks shortly after being in
; formed of the drowning. At 6 o'clock the
' body was recovered and brought to the

OXE hundred and twenty-five years
ago the blood of the Revolutionary
patriots was shed on Bunker Hill
In the cause of American liberty.
In commemoration of that battle 3000 men,
women and children, old and young, jour
neyed to Glenwood, in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, yesterday, and beneath a sky
of California blue heard revived with song
and story the tale of that eventful 17th of
June.
At 7:45 yesterday morning' the first ex
cursion boat pulled out of the slip, loaded
guard deep with patriotic human freight.
An hour later a second boat plowed her
way across the bay. Jammed just as full
as the earlier one. Brass bands accom
panied each section of the train that car
ried the patriotic merrymakers through
the Santa Cruz Mountains to the picnic
grounds. The usually silent depths of the
wooded canyons flung back and forth the
strains of patriotic airs sung with super
human energy and enthusiasm by the
Joyous holiday-makers as they whirled.
Three hours the Journey took, and it is
safe to say that not one of the two train
loads found It tiresome.
Arrived at the grounds luncheon was.
naturally enough after the long journey,
the first thing thought of. Happy groups
of picnickers distributed themselves be
neath the shade of the grand old red
woods and feasted ej-es and appetites at
one and the same time. The business of
eating over, the majority adjourned to
the dancing pavilion, where, in the mazes
of dreamy waltzes and lively polkas and
quadrilles discoursed by the Second Artil
lery Banti, time passed pleasantly enough
till 1:30. when the notes of a bugle call
rang out, announcing to all within hear
ing that the feature of the day was about
to take place.
Season of Music and Eloquence.
The literary exercises served to re
mind the crowd that they did not go
to Gienwood for pleasure alone, but
to implant In the hearts of their
famines, and to keep preen in their own
memories, the event after which the day
was called. Not that many needed
prompting in their patriotism. Every
mother's son and daughter was brimming
over with it and it kept demonstrating It
self In the shape of bursts of irrepressi
ble enthusiasm throughout the day and
exercises.
The- keynote of the day was struck in
the lines of the Border Poet Imprinted
on 'each programme:
Breathes there a man with soul so dead
Who never to himself hath said. This is ray
own.. my native land?
Pride for and love of their native land
was the spur which urged speakers and
singers on to surpass themselves in mel
ody and eloquence and to incite the au
dience to a yet more demonstrative en
thusiasm than that Inspired by the burn
ing words of the orators.
President Badger's Address.
After an overture by the bandâ a med
ley of patriotic alrs-^the Rev. T. J. Lacy
offered a prayer. "William J. Badger,
president and founder of the Bunker Hill
Association, then stepped on the plat
form and after the applause with which
he was greeted had died away delivered
a few brief opening words. The speaker
told the audience of the occasion that
each June 17 put farther away in thÂ»
years, but as history showed which had
had the effect of founding a magnificent
nation of untold possibilities lying hid In
the^uture which lay like a book open
before tlu-m. In conclusion, the speakei
paid a fine tribute to General Joseph
Warren, who gave up his life for his
country on the blood-stained sward of
Bunker Hill.
The stage was then occupied by Alfred
Wilkie. who delivered the soul-stirring
"Sword of Bunker H1U" with splendid
effect, being called upon to repeat the
last stanza twice.
The -singer was followed by Judge Ed
ward A. Belcher, who after paying a
graceful tribute to the memory of the
revolutionary heroes Introduced the orator
of the day, Weston C. Allen. J
Orator Allen Applauded.
Mr. Allen's oration was in every respect
a satisfactory one. and the loud and long
applause which It received was well de
served. After the welcome his appearance
caused had subsided, Mr. Allen spoke In
part as follows:
"Mr. President, ladles and gentlemen,
fellow-citizens: *It gives me. I assure you.
great pleasure and fills my heart with a
sense of pride to be here to-day to ad
dress you on the glorious events which
took place at Bunker Hill 125 years ago.
In nothing, however, am I prouder than
in the fact of my right to claim the title
of an American citizenâ a title which pro
claims its owner a participant in all the
privileges possible to a free and great peo
ple under the enlightened form of govern
ment we enjoy. An old adage says, 'Do
not forget that small things make suc
cess.'
"Bunker Hill may seem a more or
less small thing compared with oth'er
battles of the Revolution bloodier and
more glorious, but not a battle of
that war fought for the holy cause of
liberty was more fraught with polit
ical significance than it was. To-day
the prosperity we enjoy we owe as a debt
to the spirit thos_Â© patriots, always behold-
ing^ lib'ertv amid the smoke and din of
battle, instilled in us and ours. "We may
safely to-day look forward into the years
of the future .without a fear."
At the conclusion of the oration Mrs.
Eva Tenney sang "The Star-Spangled
Banner," the entire audience joining in
the chorus, every head being bared as the
notes rang out.
The Emalada Ladies' Quartet, Evelyn
Dickey and Mrs. A. Dencke sopranos, and
Lillian Copping and Ada Allen Norton al
tos, then rendered "The Marseillaise," and
after "America" had been sung by the au
dience and Rev. T. J. Lacy had pro
nounced the benedietlon a general rush
was made for the, racetrack, where nine
teen events, each brimful of excitement to
the merrymakers, were run off.

DEATH OF A VENERABLE
OAKLAND MINISTER
SUPERIOR JUDGE E. C. HART
of Sacramento County has de
cided that he is not disquali
fied from sitting in the trial of
. the suit of the Contra Costa
"Water Company against the city of
Oakland to declare the present
water rates Illegal. He has fonnally
announced his Intention of sitting in
t the case, despite the specific request
made by Robert T. Hayne, the spe
cial attorney for the city of Oak
land, that he not try the case. Thus
the outcome of one of the many le
gal sensations that have occurred In
the courts of Alameda County Is the
remarkable determination of a
Judge from another county deciding
to try a case In which he was in
vited to sit by one of the Superior
Judges of the county, after ho was
directly requested to withdraw by
the attorney for the people.
The entire proceeding was most.,
unusual, anirno matter how many
declarations Judge Hart may make
that he will give a fair and impar
tial hearing of the case, there will
always lurk In the Oakland mind a
feeling . that he may have been
prejudiced by the unequivocal stand
taken by the attorneys for the city.
OAKLAND, June 15.â Judge E. C
Hart came down from Sacramento
this morning, having announced
yesterday that he would render a
decision this afternoon on the motion of
Robert T. Hayne. special counsel for tha
city of Oakland in the water rate suit
brought by the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, that he retire from the trial of the
case as disqualified. Judge Hart an
nounced on Thursday that he would give
his decision in writing and he had so
prepared It, but before he ascended the
bench in Judge Ogden's department this
afternoon he destroyed his written de
cision and rendered a verbal one.
Judge Hart began, his decision by ex
plaining that to-<iay was the only day he
could give to the case until far into next
week, and then gave an outline oÂ£ the
case from the time that Judge Ogden de
cided that he was a party at interest azd
consequently disqualified down to and in
cluding the arguments for and against his
sitting as the trial Judge in the caje,
"I know that it is the duty of a Judge,"
continued Judge Hart, â¢'against whom an
objection is made to sitting in a causa
Â¦where he has any doubt as to his right to
do so, his authority to do so or his duty to
do so, to resolve that doubt in favor of
the party who objects and relinquish or re
tire from the bench. On the other hand l
know that when a Judge conscientiously
and honestly believes he is not disquali
fied It is just as much his duty to re
main as a trial Judse of the cause. In
other words, it is not compatible with the
dignitv and honor of the distinguished po
sition "to which a Judge Is elected by the
people to shirk any duty that Is incum
bent upon him or thrown upon him by the
law."
Judge Hart then read several sections
of the codes and referred to several de
cisions and finally quoted the section of
the constitution which makes the calling
of an outside Judge possible and contin
ued his decision, saying:
A Peculiar Condition.
"Now suppose in a county where there
is but one Judge and the Judge therein
is disqualified by reason of interest la the
litigation pending before the court; he
would in ail probability resort to the nec
eÂ«sarv and usual and ordinary procedure
of calling the attention of the Governor
to the fact and requesting the Governor
to request a Judge to go into the county
and hear that cause. Suppose the Gover
nor did not and would not do it. Accord
ing to my construction and interpreta
tion of this provision of the constitution
I don't think you could make him do it.
It simply says "When he does do it.' mere
lv a power that he can employ. When he
does do it it is the duty or the Judga
to go, but there is nothing in the consti
tution, in my opinion, that makes U'man
datory upon the Governor to do it.
"If that is a correct conception of that
section of the constitution what would be
the result If the contention of the defend
ant in this case be true that the Judge
wa3 disqualified from calling in another
Judge? It would be somebody's duty to do
so. Somebody would have to do something
in order that litigation might be disposed
of. Therefore. In my opinion, it would be
left to the Judge who was disqualiSed to
try the cause to call in a Judge to dispose
of that business before the court.
"I have reached the conclusion, whether
right or wrong, that it was meant under
section 170 of the Code of Civil Procedure
that the Judge who might be disquali
fied from trying the cuuse might, within
that language, have the power of calling
in a Judge to dispose of the case in which
he i3 disqualified.
Believes He Is Qualified.
"I have concluded, therefore, that I am
cot disqualifiied to try this case for any
reason.
"I -wish to further state that during the
progress of the argument on this question
there were brought into the case some
matters which bear upon the propriety
of my sitting in this case for personal rea
sons and considerations. "W hile it is a
matter of much* delicacy for a Judge to
preside over the trial of a cause in which
me parties upon one side or the other ap
pear to believe that the political associa
tions and affiliations of the trial Judge
are such as to render it hardly probable
that he would be fair and impartial In the
discharge of his official duties, I regard
it as my duty as a public officer, exercis
ing the highest and noblest functions of
government, solemnly and sacredly
pledged to administer the law faithfully
and honestly as I understand it, without
regard to persons or their social standing
or political or religious creed or opinion,
ana so far as my humble abilities will
permit me to uphold the dignity of the
honorable position to which I was elected,
to refuse to relinquish the right which I
believe is clearly vested In me to remain
as the trial Judge in this case.
"I wish further to say that I entertain
absolutely no feeling against any one con
nected with this cause for any objections
which may have been interposed against
my trying this cause. I recognize the In
alienable right of any attorney or any
party to a litigation to do everything that
is honorable and proper to see that a fair
and impartial trial, as la contemplated by
law and to which every citizen is entitled,
is had. to raise such questions and call
them to the attention of the court as will
enable tne Judge to determine whether or
not any course to be pursued will circum
vent that trial to which every citizen is
entitled in this country.
Will Be Fair and Impartial.
"I propose to try this cause if! live or
If my. health remains good, and I hope
and propose to demonstrate to the citi
zens of Oakland and to the citizens of
California that I can. as I always have
since I have been upon this bench, be ab
solutely fair and Impartial in the trial of
this cause and that I shall decide it ulti
mately, when the cause Is submitted to
me. upon the facts and upon nothing else,
"Gentlemen, it is an unusual thing for
a Judge to make a speech from the bench.
This might be characterised a3 such, but
there were some little things said during
the hearing of the cause which, of course,
would naturally hurt the feelings of an
individual; but I say I do not entertain
any feeling- against the honorable gentle
man who believes it to be his duty to his
clients to use these expressions. I can as
sure him. as I said beforeSthat they shall
have a fair trial and ample time in which
to prepare."
Judge Hayne. for tho city, took tho
usual exception, but said not a word fur
ther, and an hour more was taken v? with
argument over the motion ol the city that
they be permitted to examine certain
book3 of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany. The wnole proceeding hinged upon
the fact that it was vacation time. Th<Â»
attorneys for the Contra Costa Water
Company, who are fuiry prepared %for
trial, wanted ttie case set for trial at once,
and Â¦would not consent to the hearing' of
the motion to examine books unless they
could get the case set for trial. The wi'ola
matter was finally settled by Judge Hart,
who said that he would hear the motion
to examine books next Wednesday, *n<J
that the attorneys for the Contra Costa
Water Company could be prepared to op
pose the motion at that time.
Despite the Objections of the Attorneys for the
City the Sacramento Jurist Decides
to Remain.
Holds That He Is Legally Qualified
to Try the Oakland Water
Rate Case.

Judge Seawell Decides That He Can
not Attack the State School
1-und.
E. C. Kilpatrlck, ex-principal of the
Business Evening School, has been de
nied his back salary* by Judge Seawell.
He sued the School Board for pay for all
the. time he was under suspension, and It
would probably have been granted to him
from the city school fund if there had
been any money there, but there was none
and the Auditor refused jto audit his de
mand upon the State fund. Kilpatrlck
sued to compel him to do so, â¢ and now
Judge Seawell, to whom the case was as
signed for trial, has decided that he
cannot have the money. In his decision
Judge Seawell said:
The St8te school fund can be used only for
the payment of teachers of primary and gram
mar schools. It Is contended by plaintiff Kil
patrlck that the Business Evening School Is a
grammar school. It appears, however, by the
minutes of the Board of Education that the
only studies which are required to be taught
In that school are bookkeeping:, stenography
and type-writing and that the standard for ad
mission to It Is: First, graduation from a pram
mar school; second, graduation from the elgrbth
grade of the evening school; third, examina
tions equivalent to the standard of graduation
from a grammar school.
The Business Kvening School, being neither
a primary nor a grammar school, the plaintiff,
as one of Its teachers, is not entitled to be paid
out of any part of the moneys In the treasury
which came from the "Â»ate school fund.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 17, 1900.
Two Women Voters Who Improve Their Franchise.
One helped elect delegates to the Philadelphia convention and the other
helped manage the Populist party.
INDIAN TERRITORY, June 16.â Indian Territory, which does not even have a
voice in the Electoral College of the United States, and. furthermore, is not even
possessed of that right and privilege of suffrage given to the newly acquired
possessions of Cuba, Hawaii and Porto Rico (a Territorial form of government),
was the first to recognize the influence of the fair sex in politics by allowing
Miss Ida Bennett Miller, a Choctaw maiden, a seat in the Republican State Con
vention at Purcell, held for the purpose of electing delegates to the Philadel
phia convention.
"I am more than proud to state that I was at St. Louis In 1S36, when Mc-
Kinley was nominated for President, and watched the proceedings with great
interest, and if I live until 1904 you will see me make a fight to go to the next
national convention as a delegate. It is time that women were asserting their
rights in polities, and that Bhall be my aim in future years, as I intend to or
ganize a female Republican club in the Indian Territory."
SIOUX FALLS, 8. D., June 16.â Mrs. Mary A. Wright, one of the three mem
bers of the Populist National Committee from Idaho, made many friends among
politicians while the convention was in session here. She is a member of the
Idaho House of Representatives, and gives the impression of having added a
thorough political training to her natural abilities in that line.
Mrs. Wright is a schoolteacher by profession and one of the most respected
educators in the State. She is an active worker in primaries and has served on
several important legislative committees. One of her special ambitions is to
convince Eastern women that their prejudice against women In politics is mis
taken.

Olive Oil for the Hair.
To the well-sroomed woman the care of
her hair Is a subject of paramount im
portance, and every new recipe to prevent
It from falling out. to keep it In the neces
sary condition of wave, flufflnesa and gen
erally well-cared-for appearance. Is hailed
with Joy and Immediately tested.
Some well-meaning persons have' sworn
by kerosene, and many easily persuaded,
women have tried It. only to find them
selves a nuisance to the family while the
"cure" was in process, ahd In the end
obliged to abandon its use-from the very
disagreeable after effects of the treat
ment.- . . .
All authorities on the subject of hair
doctorlnp agree that the natural oil of the
hair. Judiciously augmented by an arti
ficially applied oil, will be of material
benefit in producing luxuriant, glossy
tresses and prevent the long ends from
splitting and the hair from falling out,
for the reason that the roots are properly
nourished. _
Another reason why some pooa oil
should be carefully applied to the roots
of the hair is the necessity of keeping the
scalp loose from the head, and by this
means permitting the natural oil of the
hair to nourish it as nature Intended It
It has been found th^t the best, purest
olive oil, purchased at some reliable gro
cery or Italian warehouse, or In small
quantities from the drugstore, has all the
mechanical qualities of kerosene, without
any of the disagreeable after effects.
Onlv use very little at a time, dipping
the fingers Into a saucer containing not
more than half a teaspoonful of the very
best oil. Then massage the scalp thor
oughly (not letting the oil touch the long
ends of the hair), until It is worked in so
completely that the scalp feels almost
drv
This treatment applied once a week with
a shampoo, the principal ingredient of
Â¦which is the white of an egg. and then
washed with hot water and white castlie
soap and afterward carefully and thor
oughly rinsed with hot water once every
?wo weeks It is said, will prevent the hair
from falling out. will keep it fluffy and yet
elo^ay. and those who have tried It say
it is on>\of the best of the many recipes
recommended.-New York Herald.

abandoned the attitude of waiting. In which it
has been bo long steadfast, and gave itself

of these was the action of the directors of the

the common stock. This was accept<-d as a

conservative authorities that a considerable

of declining railroad earnlr.es was to be ex

CHICAGO, June 16. â The wheat market to
day was broad and excited. The Increased
outside interest was especially noticeable, al
though most of the time the trade was too
large to follow In detail In a general way
lt was a market made .by an army of buyers
on one side and a numerous contingent of
longs out after profits on the ether. The buy
ers were the more numerous, as well as the
i mere eager, and a strong advance was the
result. July opened tyQlc higher at 75Q75%c.
and Fhortly afterward sold at 75c. Liverpool
was l'4d higher, an evidence that the Eng
lish arft at last beginning to appreciate some
thing of the reported blight in the Northwest.
j July, following the opening, was crushed back
! to 74Hc by the liquidation of longs. A rally
enEued to 75Hc. the highest price of the r"ecent
t bulge. Over 75c there was heavy selling by
j longs, but so well was their offerings taken
I that July reacted only %SHc and closed buoy
i ant 1H6H4C over yesterday at 75H@75>4c. Gen
! erally the advices from the spring wheat au
thorities was that the failure this season
would prove the worst the Northwest has ever
known. France, lt was said, would have to
I Import SO.000,000 bushels to make up her short
1 age. Complaints of excessive rains were re
ceived from Southern Illinois, Kentucky and
Tennessee.
Corn was firm In sympathy with wheat, but
trade was not particularly active. July closed
%c up at 89%c.
Oats followed wheat and corn. Shorts were
good buyers of both July and September, while
the best selling came from profit-takers. Sep
tember closed at 22%o, July Y*.o over yesterday
at 23c
The provisions market was fairly active and
strong. The strength was because of light hog
receipts, higher prices at the yards and to a
degree on the grain strength. July pork closed
2o'?i27Vic over yesterday, July lard l<V4o up and
July ribs loc higher.

The general opinion is that the rains are too
late Snow estimates that Jhe three States
of North and South Dakota and Minnesota will
not produce over lOO.COO.OOO bushels.
Argentine advices are that Corn farm work is
making slow progress, owing to -continued wet
weather. The weather In the Danublan prov

provement is all that can be desired. The re
ports to the Paris Echo Agrlcole are some

Stephen M. "v\Tiite was unanimously
elected chairman of the California dele
! gation to the Democratic National Con
| ver.tion. to be held in Kansas City next
i month, yesterday. The nomination was
1 made by M. F. Tarpey and no other name
I was mentioned. The result of the vote
was greeted with applause. The delegation
was called to order in the California Hotel
; to make arrangements. The principal
business after the election of a chairman
j was to arrange for the trip to Kansas
j City, and in this connection the main sub
j jc-ct of discussion was the selection of a
i route. All the railway lines leading to
; Kansas City had representatives in the
lobbies of the hotel, and they were by in-
I vitation also present during the earlier
part of the meeting, when they submitted
! proposals for transporting the delegates
j The route finally decided upon is as fol
j lows: Central Pacific to Ogden. Denver
! and Rio Grande Western and Denver and
! Rio Grande to Denver. Santa P> from
; Denver to Kansas City. The delegates
1 will select their own routes for the return
' trip, as they will r.ot come back in a bodv.
i The delegates were polled of the choice of
route to take from Ogden, and the result
was a tie. Curtis Hillver changed hit;
vote Rnd that gave the choice to the Den
ver and Rio Grande route. The delegates
: will start June 29 in special cars. It was
1 decided not to name a secretary until the
i delegates are on the train.
The meeting was presided over by Ste
; phen M. Whit<?. L. McCabe acted as sec
; retary. The delegates present were: At
j largeâ Stephen M. White. James G. Ma
gulre. M. F. Tarpey and J. D. Phelan.

Charles Kdelman. James G. Maguire and
M. F. Tarpey were appointed a committee
to make all necessary arrangements for
I the comfort and convenience of the dele
j gates. This will include the providing of
wines and other articles with which to
j keep open house after the California fash
j ion at Kansas City. The committee was
; given authority to change the route if the
! roads selected should not accommodate
; the party with what is found to be neces
', sary â possibly an extra car. !
; A" telegram was received from the Utah
i delegation inviting the Californians to ac-
I companv the men from Utah to Kansas

As Berens must leave the city Tuesday,
It was at first decided to charge Brown

Information of no small importance was
received yesterday fram Washington by
Congressman Julius Kahn. It was in sub
stance that hereafter the Government
will allow the shoe manufacturers of San
Francisco and California to compete
for army s=hoe contracts. During the
war with Spain only "rush" orders of
the most pressing nature were filled by
local dealers, the supplies in footwear
coming from the East. Western makers
protested and the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association took up the fight,
representing that as good shoes can be
furnished by Western factories as by
thos*e in the Kast. However, the purchas-
Vng agents for the army paid but little
attention to the demand from the Pacific,
passing the matter by saying that the
particular quality of russet and black
leather was not made here, etc. '
Neither the association nor the manu
facturers would drop the matter, hut cor
responded with the Pacific Coast repre
sentatives at Washington, saying that if
Western contractors would be given a
chance to bid. any quality, quantity and
prade of footwear would be furnished.
Congressman Kahn was among the most
enthusiastic champions of -tho manufac
turers and held a number of interviews
with Quartermaster General Ludington.
Soon after returning Mr. Kahn recalled
the subject by wire, and yesterday he re
ceived the following dispatch from the
quartermaster general:
"In connection with proposition for
Eastern purchases, bids for black and
russet for San Francisco delivery are
about to be Invited at Ran Francisco."
Congressman Kahn immediately called
upon a number of the larger shoe manu
facturers and informed them that the
Eastern monopoly In furnishing shoes for
the army had been broken and that the
uestern makers would now be given ah
equal chanco.

mation From Washington That
the Fight for Recognition
Has Been /Won.

riaprs of California divorcees to observe the letter of the law as laid down
by th<Â» San Francisco jurist, and to prefer his fashion of nuptial knots to
those tied by a Reno minister.
Cooper and the lady who since July. 1 C 5S. had suffixed his r.ame to that by
Â¦which she had been previously known, secured a ticket from Cupid Danforth
yesterday and then soupht Justice of the Peace Kerrigan, in whose presence they
once more took each other for better or for worse. It was necessarily a hasty
nuptial, for which no cards were Issued, and it Is safe to wager that the cere
mony will not be followed by a bridal tour.
The lady who twice gave her heart and hand to John Cooper was divorced
from Frederick Bachman on May 12. 1838, or which date the court decreed she

Everything went well, as far as records go. until Belcher rendered his famous
