ROBERTS HAS INVADED THE
TERRITORY OF THE TRANSVAAL
Camp of the Lick Observatory Party at Thomaston, Ga.
(From a photo furnished by Director. James E. Keeler.)
ATLANTA. Ga., May 27. â Cloudless skies are reported to-night from the various impromptu observatories scattered
along the shadow track of to-morrow's eclipse from Alabama to North Carolina. The observers were in a highly
hopeful mood to-night over the favorable outlook for propitious conditions. Many of the astronomers, in order that
even the possibility of accident may be removed, will remain- up all night. Everything id in exact order for the morn
ing's work. The path of the eclipse takes a course across a portion of the globe, starting in the Pacific Ocean at
a point southwest of Cape St. Lucas, in Lower California, It will first be observed on land on the west coast of Mexico,
whence the moon's shadow travels at a velocity of a thousand miles an hour, being "total" at New Orleans at 7:30 o'clock
in the morning and on the Atlantic coast at or near Norfolk about an hour later. . - . ,
The United States observers have settled upon two pointsâ Pinehurst. N. C. and Barnesville. Ga.â as the very best for
observation,' owing, in the first place, to their being right in the center of the "path of totality," and in the second, to the
probable clearness of the atmosphere there at this season of the year. To these points they have transported several tons
of special apparatus and have erected the largest cameras ever used for photographic operations. Jt is the special desire
of the astronomers to obtain numerous photographs, not only of the .oscillation and transit of the Hun and moon but of
the various solar phenomena, such as Ithe corona,' thÂ«f photosphere ..f^nd. chromosphere â those" Vast .seas of incandescent
' gases- which~are said to extend 1.000,000 miles on, each of the sufy, while the jets of flame in. the chromosphere are
thought to rise to a height of 160,000 miles.
The second Government party of observation will take its stand at Tripoli, in North Africa. The results of the observa
tion by the Government forces In Georgia will be cabled to Tripoli, where the astronomers will not be called upon to bring
their telescopes into play. until 5 In the afternoon. The afternoon information wired to North Africa will be used for the
guidance of the Government observers there. In Atlanta the eclipse' will be almost total, j Scientifically speaking, the de
gree of obscuration will be -0S6, the sun's diameter being 1.
The principals of all the white schools in the city have given leave of absence to observe the eclipse from any point
In the State they may select The -weather bureau here will take observations, principally in the shadow bands.
LISBON, May 27.â Crown Prlnco Louis of Portugal has gone to Ovar to see the eclipse, and Queen Dowager Marie has
gone to Serra de Estrella." Many tourists have left for favorable points of observation.'
WASHINGTON, May 27. â The following special sun eclipse weather bulletin was issued by Chief Moore to-day: "The
weather map this morning gives practically sure indications that the entire line of the eclipse will have .clear weather. The
presence of an anti-cyclonic system covering the whole South Atlantic States insures light, variable winds, moderate tem
perature and a uniform decrease in the vertical gradient. Probably no eclipse ever occurred under finer seeing condi
tions than will exist to-morrow." --....
The Weather Bureau will secure some data, including the effect on. the temperatures during the eclipse throughout
much of the region east of the Mississippi River. Special observations are to bfÂ» taken frequently durine the time of the
eclipse. At the Naval Observatory observations of the contacts will be made with the twenty-six-inch equatorial telescope
and also with the twelve-Inch equatorial. .^~
LONDON. May 2S.â Although England is 700 miles north of the line of total eclipse, the Royal Observatory at Green
wich is making every preparation to observe the partial obscuration.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va., May 27.â The total eclipse to-morrow morning has attracted more guests to the hotels at
Old Point than they have had at any one time for years. Over a thousand more persons are expected on the boats ar
riving ear,ly to-morrow from Washington and Baltimore. The President anA his party will witness the eclipse, from the
deck of the dispatch boat Dolphin. Secretary Gage and a party of friends arrived at Old Point this morning on the light
house tender Holly, which tied up at the Government pier near the Hygeia Hotel. Speaker Henderson and several mem
bers of the House reached Old Point last night.

At Thomaston Lick Observatory has stationed Professor W. W. Campbell, senior astronomer on the observatory staff,
and Professor C. D. Perrine with a quantity of valuable apparatus. The period of totality, when the sun will be entirely in
eclipse, will be one minute and twenty-five seconds. During these brief seconds, if the day Is a clear one, Professor Camp
â¢ bell expects to secure forty valuable photographs showing the different phases of the sun and its corona. About sixteen sci
entists are in Professor Campbell's party, and the entire number will be needed to properly handle the telescopes and other
Instruments.
Two Holland astronomers, -Professor A. A. Nyland, director of the Utrecht Observatory, and Dr. .J .H. Whltterdink. as

It is regarded as unlikely that- the

This section has been flooded with false
tales of British cruelty, reports of the
burning of farmhouses and the eviction of
women and children. In the hope of In
ducing the burghers to remain at the com
mandoes, but the evidence all points now
to the existence of a permanent feeling of
enmity between the Transvaalers and the
Free Staters, each accusing the other of
treachery and cowardice.
The troops ahve been splendidly handled
and the Boers, completely outmaneuvered,
have been forced to abandon their posi
tions at the first appearance of the Brit

termined resistance at the Vaal impossi
ble.
Many Transvaal burghers are now trek
king homeward, and it Is safe to say that
the most lrreconclllable Transvaaler at
least recognizes the hopelessness of the
struggle. Most of the farms in the north
ern part of the Free State, where the ties
of blood with the Transvaal are the
strongest," have been deserted.

A Cape Town correspondent says:
"United States Consul General Stowe is

Several prominent Uitlanders have
joined Lord Roberts as guides and ad

Lord Roberts has wired the War Office
that there Is urgent need of more rolling
stock and the Daily Express asserts that
contracts have been placed in the United

cars, the British manufacturers being un
able to fill the orders with requisite speed.
Some 500 or 600 Boers are operating east

General Rundle Is slowly sweeping the
eastern section of the Free State. Occa
sionally his squadrons come across parties
of Boers, two or three in number, and
usually on foot, who are yearlly going to

en their backs. Wholesale surrenders are
expected, but thus far they have not oc

nothing is known regarding casualties.
Two Small Engagements.
The indications are that a pitched battle
is imminent at Laings Nek. where Gen
eral Buller faces the Boers, reinforced and
seemingly determined, with an estimated
strength of from 8000 to 10.000 men. The
reinforcements contain a large party from
Ladybrand and fresh commandos from
Pretoria. General Butter's officers are
doubtful of the ability of the Boers to dis
play the same tenacity as in the fighting
at Ladysmlth.
The British are confident that when the
moment arrives they will be able to force
the passes.
Two boxes of "dynamite fuse have been

General Buller is causing numerous ar

C7. âEurope stands ready to intervene in South Africa if the United States
will lead thn way. A diplomat who is well acquainted with the feeling in
Curope with respect to thp South African war said to-day that, the Uoer
rf.rnmission. after Â« tour of the West" which is expected to begin on 'next
V.vdr.t-sCay and end in a fortnight, will return to Europe and endeavor to
er.llFt the aid of thos?f? governments by informing them that the sentiment of the
United States is favorable to the Bor-rs.
When the Boer Commissioners were in Europe they found the continental na
tions wore opposed to taking: action because of their ffar that the United States
would throw its support to Great Britain. Their brief stay in this country and the
reports received from friends throughout the West have convinced them that the
t'nited States will not aid the British Government in case of intervention by Eu
rope. There Is a feeling in Boor circles that the administration would be willing
Jo assist the Britten Government in case of a continental coalition against it, and
it is proposed to harp on this fact during the coming campaign for the double pur
posp of influencing voters against the President and cf creating such a strong
sentiment that a breach will he created between the two governments, and EuropÂ»
Â¦will be able to see for itself that any action it may take in South Africa will cause
no protest from this country, but will rather bi> viewed v.-ith satisfaction. -
The plans which the Boer Commissioners have formulated show conclusively
that they are confident the war will not end during tlu> present summer. Lord
Roberts with the British army Is expected by the commission to reach Pretoria
within ten days. The siege of the cnpital will tben commence, and it is expected
the garrison \vill not capitulate until after the Presidential election in this coun
trv. If McKinley is re-elected the collapse of the war will then be precipitated; if
Bryan is elected the Boers will obtain new courage ar.d will hold out as long as
possible in the hopo that Bryan will immediately carry out the promises he has
made. Bryan will receive support from the Boer Commissioners, who are expect
ed t<Â» niurn to the ITnitecl States in September and resume their efforts to create
sympathy for their cause.
A member of the European diplomatic representation here stated to-day that
the British woulo undoubtedly be allowed to do what they would in South Africa.
"It 5s true that the sympathy of the Continent is with the Boers." he contin
ued, "but it would lÂ»e hazardous in the extreme for anv of the nations to act un
less they should art together. The subject of joint action "has not recently been
discuvsed, for the reason that the German Emperor, probably as a result of his
memorable visit to the Quoen some month.* ago. is opposed to interference. Europe
has been carefully watching the attitude of the United States in this matter, and
while it understands that the sentiment of this country is strongly pro-Boer it
knows that intervention by this Country is out of the question."

it can occur between his Government and Japan, as there are no controversies
existing between them. On the other hand it Is known that the war feeling la

territorial fruits of her war with China and at a propitious moment she is ex
pected to act.

Senator Hoar at a children's day celebra

which time the anti-imperialist statesman
is reported to have said that the tree of
liberty and self-government set out by the
fathers of the republic having spread
across the continent, its roots would "in

waves and spread to the isles of the sea "
"This prediction," said Dr. Hovt "came
true more quickly than the distinguished
Senator anticipated and evidently more
cjuickly than he desired. It is true that
he made the eJoquent statement in 1895
and hundreds of anti-expansion speeches
in 1900 could not efface .the effect of that
truthful prediction."

The Houstj leaders are figuring 1 that the
Senate will agree to the House resolution
to adjourn on Wednesday. June 6, so that
much business will be crowded into the
coming 1 , Â¦week. J individual members Â¦with
belated bills art* pressing for recognition
and will be given some show. Confer
ence reports -on appropriation bills will
have the right of way. There are a half
dozen measures of public Importance
pressing. Including the oleomargarine bill;
the anti-canteernbllli the St. I^oula Kair
bill, the Philadelphia Museum bill and the
anti-trust measures, but- the Indications
are that none of them save the anti-trust
bill and resolution will be considered. Fri
day and Saturday are to be- devoted to
i heir consideration under special rules.
The friends of the others, however, are
active, aggressive and insistent, and some
of them may be successful. But the pro
granYme Of the leaders does not go much
beyond driving through the appropriation
bills, the passage of the anti-trust legisla
tion and the cleaning up- of a few odds
and ends.
Flans of House Leaders.
It Is generally believed that the Mon
tana Senatorial contest will be disposed
of when it Is brought up by referring It to
the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions, and that then nothing more will be
heard of it during the present session. The
committee resolution declaring that Sena
tor Clark's original election was not legal
also bids fair to remain on the calendar.
Senator Wellington will speak on Mon
day on the Boer resolution, and he will
be followed that day or the day there
after by Senator Teller on the Philippine
question. Speeches on the Philippine ques
tion will be made by Senators Pettlgrew
and Turner and probably by other Sena
tors There Is apparently no probability
of the Philippine bill passing, but there
is a general uesure on tne part of the op
position to reply to Senator Spooner's
speech before the close ol the present ses-
The sundry civil appropriation bill prob
ably will be considered for two or three
days more, and by the time it is disposed
of the genera! deficiency bill will be ready
for consideration. Neither, the deficiency
nor the military academy bill, the only
appropriation bills undisposed of, except
the sundry civil bill, 1? expected to con
sume any considerable amount of time.
The Se'nate will make an effort to meet
the plans of the House In the matter of
linal adjournment on June 6. but there Is
a peneral apprehension among Senators
that th" date may be postponed until the
lith or the 11th. In addition to the appro
priation bills still undisposed of by thÂ©
Senate there are sttll several appropria
tion bills in conference, and a disposition
Is manliest on the part of Senators not to
name the date of adJQUrnment until these
are well out of the way.
WASHINGTON, May 27.â The time of

Water-
Injury to the Vessel Is Not Very
Great and She Will Probably
Be Put on the Ways in
a Few Days.
The Danube has been rather unfortu
nate In comparison with the other ves
sels of the Canadian Pacific Navigation
Company's fleet. It is only eleven months
ago since she went on a rock near Union
while bound to Skaguay with freight and
passengers.
She had on board when the accident oc
curred one of the largest cargoes and big
gest complements of passengers that she
has carried flnce the opening of naviga
tion last year. There were over fifty
passengers and close on 600 tons of valu
able freight, consisting for the most part
of groceries and supplies for Dawson.
The cargo was all, or nearly all, covered
by Insurance. The loss to the insurance
men will not be very great, as the cargo
damaged by water was not of compara
tively large proportions.
The steamer will go on the Esqulmalt
marine ways for repairs.
Captain H. R. Foote was in charge of
the Danube when she struck. Had she
been traveling fast she would probably
have cleared the rocks, for the forward
part of the vessel passed over them with
out touching. Then, too, had assistance
been received within half an hour of the
time she struck the steamer would prob
ably have been easily freed. When she
became fast the engines were reversed
and every effort made to free her, but all
SEATTLE, May 27. â The steamer Dan
ube is on the rock3 near Hospital Point,
Victoria. She was swept there by a
heavy wind which caught her broadside
on when she was swinging around into
the channel between the Point and Lent's
wharf. The accident happened last
Thursday. She lies with a list of about
twenty feet to port. For a time there
was five feet of water In her after hold.
Her entire cargo has been unloaded.
Simple Life of Governor Wood, Gen

Others of the American

> Â¦
HAVANA, May 27.â American officials
here feel that they have been unjustly
treated by certain newspapers In the
United States, which have published the
sweeping statement that they all ilve'ex
travagantly. So far as the officers of high
rank are concerned, General Wood occu
pies only a small portiqn of thfe palace
for residential purposes, the rest of the
building being utilized for offices. A num
ber of employes have to be kept at Gen
eral Wood's expenseâ cleaners and*helpers
generallyâ and he says that if he did not
have some private resources to eke out
his pay and his allowances it would be
next to Impossible for him to live In the
palace <at all.
Collector Bliss liven quietly In a single
room at the Hotel Telegrafo, and Major
Ladd, chief quartermaster, lives in a
house which he shares with three other
families. General Lee lives at headquar
ters, at Quemados, as do all his staff of
ficers. Colonel Whiteslde. at Santiago,
lives in a little wooden bungalow, and
many officers live In buildings used by the
Government either as offices or police bar
racks.
General Wood safd, to-day that he con
sidered charges of extravagance In any
department except the postal unfounded,
adding that he believed no other depart
ment had anything to fear on that score
and that all conld endure the closest In
vestigation possible. â¢ ,
A postal official who has been on the isl
and more than a year said that when the
Americans first came there were no rec
ords, and no furniture even; that the ser
vice had to be built up upon practically
no foundation at all, and that the loose
methods of former times had been carried
on at some points even to the present day.
One feature that enabled C. F. W. Neely
to divert funds in a fashion exceedingly
difficult to detect was the custom of many
postmasters to pay cash for all stamps
taken from the department, while there
was no rule for keeping books of account.
As a result the Inspector had no way of
ascertaining how many stamps had been
sold.
This official believes that when all the
books and papers have been Investigated
the shortage will not amount to more than
$100,000. __

Peace reigns and no trouble is expected
in Manila, although the city is. crowded
with people from the provinces who were
leaving the unprotected hamlets in order
to 'avoid the conscription which the in
surgent leaders are enforcing, as well as
robbery and outrages at the hands of rov
ing insurgents and bandits. .
The investigation of the charge against
Brigadier-General Funston of having exe
cuted two natives in the province of Zam
bales has resulted in a discontinuance of
the proceedings. It developed the fact
that General Funston caught the natives
in the act of murdering bound Macabebe
scouts, his action in view of the commis
saries being regarded- as justifiable. '
The insurgent commander, with twenty
officers and 230 men, surrendered on May
20, Â¦ piring up a hundred rifles. An im
pressive scene occurred on the plaza when
the prisoners were disarmed and liberated,
xiie islanders were found suffering from
lack of food, owing to the blockade, and

J. Jackson of this city, professor of the
theory and practice ofpharmacv at the

Coincident with the annual meeting at
Richmond of the National Pharmaceutical
Association, a conference was held of rep
resentatives of the leading colleges of
pharmacy of tho country, the object bo
ing to effect an association that would
grade the profession, define the amount of
work necessary for a student to attain
the degree of Ph. G., the amount of addi
tional, work necessary for him to attain
the degree of doctor of pharmacy, and to
establish a standard that would be unt
formlv ' satisfactory, so that any State
board might be proud to register the diplo.
ma of any student from any college in the
association. Professor H. P. Hynson of
the Maryland University was chairman
and Dr. "W. J. Jackson of this city secre
tary of the temporary organization. Per
manent organization was effected by the
election of the following officers: Presi

Charles McDonald, aged -6 years, was
arrested last. night by Detectives Dlnan
and Wren and Police Officer Colon and
charged with the murder of Bernard
Kearney, his uncle, committed about a
year and a half ago. The men had a dis
pute in a saloon at" Steuart and Mission
streets, where McDonald was employed,
and finally came to blows. Getting the
worst of the encounter McDonald picked
up a bottle and struck his uncle over the
head, fracturing his skull. After adminis
tering the fatal blow McDonald, with the
assistance of a friend, took the injured
relative to the Receiving Hospital, where
he was treated. Subsequently he was re
moved to his home. 216 Essex street
where he died six days later. Becoming
alarmed McDonald packed his grip and
went to Arizona. Mrs. Kearney, the
widow of tho dead man, swore to have
McDonald punished for his crime, and
after enlisting the services of the police
she set about herself to run the young
man down. She wrote to. every Sheriff
in the country, giving a description of
McDonald and begging, them to do all in
their power to apprehend the alleged mur
derer. Two days ago McDonald returned
to this city, but managed to keep out of
the way of the detectives. He was seen
last night to enter a place of amusement
in the tenderloin district and was shortly
afterward placed under arrest. He offered
no resistance and was at once taken to
police headquarters.
McDonald positively refused' to make a
statement further than to admit he struck
his uncle during a- heated dispute. He
will.be formally charged to-day with the
crime.

Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, vicar gen
eral of the diocese. At the conclusion of
the services, which were of more than
ordinary solemnity, the visiting Arch
bishop bestowed the papal blessing on
the large congregation, which kneeled to j
receive it. Mass was celebrated by Rev. j
Father Hannigan. with Kev. Father
Ramxn as deacon and Rev. Father O'Mal

master of ceremonies.
Dr. Rooker's sermon was taken from
the words of the Canticle of Canticles
and uttered " by divine Providence to
Mary: "Thou art all beautiful, O my be
loved, and there is no t tain on thee."
"To-day is the last Sunday of the
month," said Dr. Rooker, "which Catho
lics are pleased to devote to the special
remembrance and honor of the Blessed
Virgin. Catholics look toward Mary with
feelings of tenderness, of love, of confi
dence and of worship next only to those
j feelings and sentiments we have toward
| God himself. Who is this Mary who
means so much to Catholics? How are
we to know that it is right and reason
able to adore a woman who is a creature
of God like ourselves? The answer la
that God himself has distinguished her
from all the rest of his creatures and
placed her above everything else which
he has created. It is our duty. then, to
look up to her as one occupying lirst place
among all creatures.
"Mary in the sight of the providence of
God is that one whom he had in mind
when he uttered the first promise after
the tall of our first parents and after he I
had pronounced the malediction upon
. them: 'I will plaÂ«e an enmity between
thee and one woman: between her seed
| and thy seed, and she shall crush thv i
i head. That woman was Mary. She wa's !
the one through whom the promise of j
the redemption was to be verified. Though !
the loathsome waters of the Hood of orig- '
Inal sin encompassed all mankind, Mary
was the sole person preserved^ from it's

who when her course of life was' run was

PAPAL DELEGATE
PLEASED WITH
CHURCH UNITY
There was scarcely a <3ry eye In the
congregation at the First Unitarian
Church yesterday morning when the ven
erable Rev Horatio Stebbins. D. D.. who
has been pastor of the church for over
thirty-five years, arose in the pulpit and
said farewell to his old parishioners. JJr.
Stebbins retired from active service some
months ago, giving way to Rev. Bradford
Leayitt, who is now occupying 1 the pul
pit, but he has been regular in his at
tendance and cften took part in the ser
vices. Now he has decided to remove to
Boston In order that his son and daughter
may have the advantages of the schools
there, so that it is not likely that he will
again commune- with his erstwhile fol
lowers, at least for some time to come-.
The announcement of Dr. Stebbins' con
templated departure came from the pul-
Eit quite unexpectedly. Rev. Mr. Leavitt
ad preached a short sermon from Kings
ii:x. When the Prophet Klljah was about
to depart from his active tield of work.
Eli?ha a.Â«ked him to bestow upon his suc
cessor double the share of inspiration
that he had enjoyed in his work, to which
Elijah replied in the words of the text.

STREET railway magnates in New York
City have by reason of the consolidation qf va
rious lines under one control put into operation
in that city the transfer system which has so long
prevailed in San Francisco, and the result has filled
them with amazement and delight. The transfer 15
making them rich beyond their highest hopes. It has
increased the business of all the lines and. added im
mensely to the profit.
Mr. Vrccland of the Metropolitan Company re
cently submitted what the New York Commercial Ad
vertiser calls "a plain statistical account of the miracle
that the transfer has wrought in the financial condi
tion" of the lines under the control of the company,
and our contemporary says "it reads like a veritable
fairy tale."
The statement of Vreehnd amounts to this: "There
is no line of thoroughfare road brought by a lease
under Metropolitan control the gross earnings of
which are not to-day more than twice as great as they
were the year before we took control, or which, after
all the expenses of the lease and all taxes have been
paid, does not earn for our stockholders several times
as much money as it had ever earned for its owners.
The Sixth-avenue line will earn for the current year
$1,600,000. as against $718,898 which it earned as a
separate line prior to 'the lease. The Eighth-avenue

avenue will earn $2,100,000. ns against $845,919. Ths
Second-avenue will tarn $1,450,000, as against $700,

third street line a fixed rental of $iS6,5OO, or 18 per
cent on its capital stock. And yet, when we have paid
this rental, have discharged the interest on its funded
debt, and have paid its taxes, no less a sum than $300^
000 comes into the treasury of the Metropolitan as net
Upon such a showing there was but one thing for
the Metropolitan Company to do, and of course it
was done; the company voted unanimously to in
crease the capital stock by $7,000,000. It was a case
of immediately realizing the fairy tale.- Truly the
magic of the transfer is great.

Just how these Tammany leaders obtained so much

paid for it, perhaps they worked for it, perhaps they
pulled wires for it. That, however, is a minor matter.

moreover, that had not the ice trust by its own greed
and extortion roused the people to resentment, and
thus brought about the exposure of the combine, the
connection of the Tammany men with it might never
have been known, and we should have heard them all
through the campaign shouting the Bryan cry,
"Down with the trusts!" ;:^v;-3gjjHR
New York city in the summer time swelters in heat.
Ice there is almost as essential to life as water; the de
mand for it comes from the poor as well as the rich.
Taking advantage of the new system of doing busi
ness, by means of trusts, a syndicate obtained control
of the ice supply of the city and a short time ago an
nounced a price for ice so high as to amount to some
thing like public plunder. The scheme aroused the
indignation of the people. The press almost unani
mously denounced the combination and the avaricious
and extortionate manner in which it proposed to use
its power, and the Bryanites of the city, knowing -that
anti-trust is to 1 be one of the battle cries of the cam
paign, opened up at once and began clamoring for
the suppression of the ice ring.
BRYAN is out of luck. With much toil and
tinkering he has managed to fix up an anti
trust plank in his platform, on which Tam
many promised to stand and support him. It was a
v:ctor>|for him of no small dimensions, and gave him
relief from the plotting and planning of the New
York braves to take his scalp, or try for it at the
national convention. Just as everything was fixed
up, however, and Tammany was getting ready to
decorate its chiefs in anti-trust feathers, comes an ex
posure which shows those very chiefs engaged in one
01 the worst trusts on record.
TAMMANY AND" THE TRUSTS
THE READJUSTMENT IN TRADE.
ACCOKDIXG to the statistics of Dun's Mercan
tile Agency the great commercial boom of
1S98-99 culminated at the close of the latter
year. That is. pig iron touched its highest price Xo
.vember 29; wool, December 1; hides, December 13;
leather and iron products, January 10; boots ami
shoes, January 24; woolen goods, February 21, and
cotton goods Mcrch 21. Since these dates there has
been a steady decline in the demand for these staples,
accompanied by a corresponding: decline in prices.
P-ut as far as the aggregate business of the country
is concerned the boom ended with the close of the
year, and it became apparent early in January that the
new year was lagging behind 1S99 at the very start.
Happily the descent has been so gradual that until
lately it has not been noticed. No large failures have
- resulted, for the coilap^e of Price, McCormick & Co.
last week was due entirely to bullheaded obstinacy in
sticking to the long side of a short cotton market,
and not to any intrinsic condition in the general busi
refs situation. The unusual abundance of money has
prevented any financial stringency, and the readjust
ment has therefore been natural and smooth. Â«â¢
The decline in prices continued last week, and the
lassitude in the demand for goods was marked. All
lines of merchandise j-hared the inactivity except sev
eral staple groceries, such as sugar and coffee, both
o^ which were higher. But provisions were very dull!
Iron nnd steel, boots and shoes, hides and leather,
wool and woolen goods, cotton and its products, lum
ber, raw silk. Manila hemp, petroleum and dozens of
minor staples were reported quieter and generally
lower. It is leaking out that in some prominent lines,
notably iron and leather, manufacturers have been
quietly selling; below ostensible quotations for some
time, with the view to prevent a marked break in
prices. The same thing has been going on in this
market. There is wisdom in the plan, for it lets the
market down easily.
Speculation in Wall street continues wholly in the
har.ds of the professionals, for the public still hofd
off. The silly stories of bubonic plague in Sin Fran
cisco led to some felling of American securities by
London, but when they were found to be baseless t!*u?
selling at once ceased.
The feature of the week here was the damage to
trade done by the scare rumors bruited about to-.vn re
garding the bubonic plague. How much injury was
inflicted on our local markets by this folly will never
be known, but that it was serious every wholesale
merchant in the city knows. Sometimes a doctor
produces more, sickness, real or imaginary, than he
cures especially if he be placed in a position to do it;
and when he puts hi* thumb on the pulse of tradi
he is monkeying with something that he docs net un
derstand and which he had better leave alone.

from presort indications. Prices for fruit arc thus far
good r.nd bid fair to continue so. Quotations for
grain, however, arc not as satisfactory. Labor is just
scarce enough to give the farm laborer an advance
over the fe*- previous y-3rs without seriously inconi
â¢modirjg the hv it grower, and there is no reason why
there should be an idle man in the whole State. There
may not be work enough for all in the city, but there
is plenty of it in the orchards and grain fields.
Opc Nome will probably be the most attractive
seaside resort of the summer, and there will be no
complaint of a lack of men. It may not be so stylish
as some other places, but it will have much more fun
and will not need a sea serpant to draw a crowd.

There remains but one absolute monarch in Chris

but one hereditary governing body, the English House of Lords,
and that haa had such inroads upon its membership that it fur
nishes to-day rather a proof of the decline of the aristocracy
of the grandfather than of its permanent perpetuation. ;
The hereditary aristocracy has this immense gain, that it (
is straightforward in its pretensions and claims to be nothing j
but what it is I have often wished that I cculd see in the aris
tocracy of the dollar in America that absolutely simple self
respect which you. notice In the men of England who know that
they are born to a high position and do not need to assert it.
Take, for instance, the question of coats of arms. I lived
In Newport twelve years, and in watching the parade of car
riages, many of which were decorated with coats of arms, how
often Â¦ I have wished that the owners of lho3e carriages would
show a sincere pride In the one thing that was creditable to
themâ namely, that they had laid the foundations of their own
fortunes and were willing to show it before the world.
How I wished that some man who had made a creditable
fortune out of shoes or out of hides would show it by doing
ciedit to the respectable animals which had laid the founda
tion of his fortune by putting a heifer or a bullock upon the
doors of his carriage! Why could not they imitate Bishop
\Yill<?gis, who, having been brought up a wheelwright, and be
lntr it last made a Bishop, ana being entitled to a coat of
arms when he went out to take possession of hlB picturesque
r.alace found that the little boys of the neighborhood had been
chalking wheels all over the doors and the walls of the castle?
He was a man of sense. He put a wheel upon his coat of arms
arid the little boys lost their fun and the price of chalk went
In Frankfort, over the doors of the house where the great
German poet. Goethe, was reared, you see the coat of arms of
his father. He was bred to the manufacture of horseshoes.
He put a horseshoe above his door as his crest â three horse
shoes but the artist, bring a poetic man and wishing it to ap
pear to the utmost advantage, wove those horseshoes into such
a shape that they resembled the musician's lyre, and uncon
sciously predicted that within those walls the greatest poet of
Germany was to be born. â¢
I can remember when there was but one man in the neigh
borhood of Boston who was even suspected of being a million
aire. I used to hear It discussed in my boyhood, "Do you sup-
pose that he has really got a million dollars V But what Is a
million dollars now, in these days of multi-millionaires? Re
spectable poverty.
You remember that gentleman of distinguished family who
died a few years ago and did not distribute his estate accord
ing to the liking of the community. You remember that he left
one or two of his sons $20,000,000 apiece and other sons $10,000,000,
and there was not a daughter of the family, I think, who had
more than $10,000,000 to her name. When the newspapers kindly
took it up there was not a starving country editor who did not
air h'.s indignation over those wronged and deceived ladies.
We thought of taking up subscriptions in the Sunday schools
for their benefit.
Not many years ago a gentleman of great wealth felt
that he was overtaxed in Boston. 1 never knew a gentleman
of great wealth who did not think he was overtaxed, though I
have known assessors who did not think so. He went back to
the country town where he had lived, where his father was a
quiet country clergyman, who paid a tax perhaps of $13 or $20
a year.
When he j?ot back there the selectmen and assessors of the
town naturally were somewhat startled at the sudden splashing
down into that quiet little rural lake of this gorgeous gold and
silver fish, and they, at his suggestion, had a conference with
him as to how much he would like to pay taxes on.
He said: -"Whenever bills against the town come in you
send them to me. I will settle them for a year, and we win s*Â«
how it works." He paid every bill afrainst the town that year
out of his own Income and saved $20,000 by the operation.
The aristocracy of the dollar appeals to the democratic
filing which lies at the bottom of all our opinions. My old
friend. Theodore Parker, when he first went to Cincinnati half
a centurv ago. said: "Cincinnati is the most interesting placa
in America. It has an American aristocracy in the making."
We asked for particulars, and he said: "Why. in Cincinnati
all honorable accumulations are based essentially on the porlc
business, but It makes a vast difference who fcllla the pigs.
Cincinnati's society Ifl divided between those who personally
kill pigs and those whose fathers only did it. and these may
be defined as the 'stickems" and the 'stuckems.' "
The aristocracy of the dollar Is modern. It belong3 to
peaceful, organized life. If we once go Into the imperial Dusi
ness I will not predict what the result may be.
A friend of mine, once seeing a little boy at the theater who
came there night after night and who always went sound
asleep, said to him: "Why do you always come here, my boy?
You don't seem to enjoy It very much. You always go to
sleep." "Oh." said the little boy, as he rubbed his eyes, "you

THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE DOLLAR.
Â»
(An Address Delivered at the Annual Meeting of the Savings Bank Association.)
Then why blame the actor for It?
In a certain very celebrated case involv
ing the rightâ from the standpoint of mo
ral decencyâ for a play to be given in
New York, Justice Fursman recently
handed down a decision, in which he said:
"Some minds are so sensitive as to be
shocked by the undraped statue of the
Venus de Milo, and regard the story of
the merciful journey of the Lady Godlva
as a shamefully indecent tale, while oth
ers find little to condemn In the lewd con
versation and lascivious conduct of thÂ«
men and women whose livea are given
over to debauchery and vice. The play
ls not to be condemned because it may
shock the sensitiveness of the former nor
approved because It may gratify the lat
ter."
And so you see that all men do not
hold the same idea of any one play or
book or painting, or anything of an artia
tlc nature, even though certain set rules
are put for their guidance. Everything
in the world must depend on the point of
view.
Which brings us right down to thÂ« In
efflcacy of what has been suggested for
this countryâ a stage censor. What in
the world good would the man. do?
He would only give a one-tnan idea, be
cause he could only see It from one point.
He might be right, or he might be wrong.
And it would be a tosa up of a penny
either way. If the Amwican stage is to
go to the dogs at a tremendous rate of
speed unless something radical is done
and done at once, have a whole college of
stage censors â a hundred, two hundred If
necessary.
WÂ© certainly can't leave It to the audi
ences, because nowadays the average
jtefllence 13 not a safe criterion. It will
be a'pt ,to go into ecstacies over the nasty
play ami* *o pass by the sweet-smelling
idyll that preaches hi goodness and light.
And If we can't trust thÂ»Â» American
drama to a stage censor, t? the actor, to
the playwright, or to the audience, what
1p the world are we going to do about it?
x suppose the only way out of it will
be to Import plays from the French and
the German.
It would be rather an heroic measure,
wouldn't it?
sometimes he sees the moral and some
times he doesn't. And that Is why critics
disagree quite as much as doctors. Their
rules of criticism are oftentimes affected
by the disease known as "a rush of de
cency of the heart." and they go off Into
diatribes that ' besmirch the actor or
actress, do dramatic criticism not the
least bit of good and help swell the re
ceipts of the box office.
Which brings us to another point of
view. Is the playwright wrong in build
ing a "nasty" play? Is the public wrong
in coming to see that play? And if both
are wrong or both right, what are we go
ing to do about It?
If the little Irish woman who keeps a
fruit stand at the corner of the street
finds that the small boys of the neighbor
hood like apples better than pears she
usually gets double the stock of apples
and cuts down on the other fruit. Of
course she could go about it in the other
way and lay In twice as many pears as
apples and when the fruit rotted because
she couldn't sell it and she couldn't pay
her rent because she didn't have the
money, people would say. "It's nobody's
foult but her's. Why didn't she keep
what people wanted?"
Now, your playwright is the old apple
woman. If he has some nice, clean pears
and he finds tbÂ«^> tart apple sells twice
as fast he is 4<n9Sr in for apples. He's
only giving the^Jiple what they want.
Now, let's come to tfcAjfl good, dear peo
ple. They want the 'iTÂ»?ty things*â or a
considerable portion of thÂ«iÂ»..do â else they
would not crowd the theat'Â£-r*1Â«|fi-hen they
know the nasty play has conie^n town.
All of us, more or less, like a shocJS^We
get in a rut of emotions once In a wTii!*
and anything which takes us out of it
seems to give a certain amount of pleas
ure. If the shock comes to our morals
all the worse for the morals, but why in
the mischief we blame the shock I can't
quite make out. It's not necessary for
us to take it if we don't want it. It isn't
obligatory on us to see the nasty play
any more than we are compelled to drink
five hundred glasses of whisky a day; but
the public goes to see the nasty play
merely because it wants to see nastiness.
And that's the public's affair and it isn't
the actor's.

The modification of the treaty with China so as to
permit the Chinese exclusion act furnishes a prece
dent for action in this case, and it is probable the
authorities at Washington will take steps to that end.
The people, however, should not rely too much upon
Washington. The issue is urgent, and the demand for
a Japanese exclusion act should be persistently urged
by the press and the labor organizations of the coun
try. . Only by insisting upon prompt action can the
people be sure that action will not be delayed until the
Pacific Coast swarms with Japanese laborers.
The remedy for the evil is that which The Call
pointed out at the time it first gave warning of the
danger. Our treaties with Japan must be so modified
as to admit of a Japanese exclusion act similar to that
by which Chinese are excluded. Senator Perkins in
dorses that view of the case and says: "I am informed
and I believe reliably so that the Japanese Govern
ment is opposed to the emigration of its subjects. If
such is the case, it is possible that the Government
would be willing to unite with ours in a modification
of the treaty of 1894."
Concerning the difficulty of preventing the emigra
tion of Japanese to this country through the aid of
the companies, Senator Perkins points out that the
courts have so interpreted the alien contract labor law
ar. to require that evidence of a contract having been
made abroad must be produced in court in order to
bar an immigrant suspected of being a contract la
borer. He adds: "Under existing law and decisions
based upon it it is difficult to reject those coming in
violation of the alien contract labor law, and as the
Japanese occupy the same position in the eye of the
law as citizens and -subjects of the most favored na
tion they cannot be rejected unless it is shown upon
special inquiry that they belong to one or the other
of the excluded classes."
It is stated that since the Japanese Government re
quires that a subject applying for a passport shall
provide two sureties that the applicant will not be
come a public charge or fall into distress within three
years, there have been organized in Japan something
like twelve emigration companies, each of which un
dertakes to furnish the sureties for emigrants sent out
under its charge. The companies have agents in
various parts of Japan to obtain emigrants, and good
reasons exist for believing they have agents in this
country to place the laborers after they arrive. It is
true that when Mr. Rice, an ex-Commissioner of Im
migration at Vancouver, B. C, was in Japan investi
gating the subject he was informed by one of the com
panies that it had no emigration agents in the
United States or Canada, but the statement was evi
dently incorrect, for Mr. Rice found in the Official
Gazette, published by the Japanese Government, a
notice that permission had been given by the im
perial Government to a certain Masataro Mito to act
as agent for that very company at Victoria.
I JAPANESE IMMIGRATION.
BY the letter published in The Call Saturday from
Senator Perkins to Secretary Rosenberg of the
Labor Council of this city ample evidence is
accorded to justify the warning given by The Call
some time ago of the dangerous increase of Japanese
immigration. The Senator's letter quotes largely
from official reports and shows that companies in
Japan are organized to promote the migration of la
borers to the United States, and that most of those
who come are of the ignorant class and are virtually
contract laborers.
MORALITY OP THE STAGE
AND OF THE AUDIENCE
THE morality of the stage is a rather
ticklish subject for discussion or dis
course. In all climes, In Â¦ all coun
tries, and on all stages, there have
been exploited more or less decency or
indecencyâ it depends altogether on the
point of viewâ and so the only real, vital
question is, does the playwright take a
view of morality that is in accord with
the view held by his audience, or doesn't
he?
Now right here Is where the critic of the
drama steps in. The critic has his rules,
his tenets of dramatic criticism, and
these he follows. Of course there is one
mode of criticism for a farce, one for a
burlesque, one for comic opera, another
for serious drama. He knows, for In
stance, that in a four-act play the great,
the tremendous climax must come at the
end of the third act. else the method of
construction is all wrong. He knows that
every character must have a reason for
entrance and a reason for exit. He must
know what is logical and what is not. He
must know of the unity of time, the unity
of place, the esthetic side and the moral
side of the drama.
And it Is this last point on which the
critic has most to bother him nowadays.
1 ,T X us take tnls Point up first. We are
told through the public prints that this,
tnat and the other play Is nasty in Its
theme and in its treatment and that it
is not fit to be seen by the average thea
ter-goer, much less by the Young Person.
Then immediately comes the wee, small
voice of the actor or actress who is ap
pearing in the play and says to the carp
ing critic and the legion of his readers:
"Go to. Can't you see the moral under
lying all this? Do you think that I care
to play this, that or the other character
because the taint of the moral is over it
all? I do this for my art. I do it to edu
cate the public. I do it for the good of
morals and to show the community that
underneath all this filth and all this in
decency there is a great, tremendous
moral lesson to be learned."
Now, the critic is an analytic soul, and
Such is a partial record of the prosperity which has
come to the people as a result of the defeat of Bryan
four years ago. The best argument for Republican
ism is the condition of the country to-day as com
pared with what it was in 1896. That argument ap
peals to every industrious citizen and will undoubt
edly counterbalance all that may be said by the agi
tators of calamity.
So remarkable has been the change from the panic
years of Cleveland to the prosperous years of Mc-
Kinley that a simple statement of it sounds like a
fairy tale. Ray Stannard Baker, who has recently
compiled an interesting volume on the industrial and
commercial statistics of the past year, says: <"\Veb
e:ci defines romance as a series of extraordinary
events; the year 1S99 may well be termed romantic.
The facts and figures set forth in the statistical re
ports of the Government, of banks and clearing
houses and of the trades have been so remarkable a*
to draw superlatives even from the columns of trade
journals and the financial departments of the news
papers."
In 189S for the first time the total domestic exports
of the United States exceeded those of Great Britain,
and in the following year the foreign business of the
country amounted to more than $2,000,000,000, and
the profits â that is, the excess of exports over im
ports â were more than $476,000,000. In other words,
as Mr. Baker says, "The United States in 1899 fed,
clothed and sheltered her people in comfort and even
in luxury, providing them with great quantities of
foreign as well as domestic goods, and sold her sur
plus abroad at the rate of $1,500,000 in cash for every
working day."
In all lines of industry and business the benefits of
the election of McKinley and the establishment of
the Republican policies of protection and sound
money have been manifest. In the five years from
1S94 to 1899 the bank clearings more than doubled in
amount. The stock of gold in the United States in
creased from $693,000,000 on January 1, 1897, to more
than ? 1. 01 6,000,000 on January 1, 1900. In 1806- the
number of commercial failures was 15,08s, with total
liabilities of $226,096,000. while in 1809 they numbered
but 9337. with liabilities of $90,879,889. In 1893 no
fewer than seventy-four railway companies, represent
ing the sum of $1.781. 000.000 in stocks and bonds,
went into the hands of receivers: but in 1899 only ten
roads failed, and these represented in stocks and
bonds hardly more than $50,000,000.
It is in the statistics of the savings banks, how
ever, that the story of prosperity is best told, for the
savings banks represent the welfare of labor and show
the savings of industry and thrift. Of these Mr.
Baker says: "On June 30, 1809. there were over
5.200,000 depositors in the savings banks of the
United States, compared with 4,800.000 in 1894. And
each of these depositors had more money to his ac
count than ever before, the average amount on de
posit rising from $369 for each person in 1894 to $419
in 1809. The deposits in all banks, national and
state as well as savings, representing upward of 13,-
000,000 depositors, actually doubled in ten years,
amounting in 1899 to the enormous sum of $7,514.
000.000. Of this great sum the savings banks and the
state banks, the depositories of the common people,
held nearly one-half, leaving the national banks and
trust companies the other half. And it must be re
membered that the savings banks show only a part
of the savings of the people; there arc the building
r.nd loan associations, the benefit life insurance com
panies and the stockings at home."
WHEN the Presidential campaign is at its height
the contest will be waged mainly upon one or
j two issues, and to them most of the oratory
of the spellbinders will be devoted; but it is probable
the determining factor in the struggle will be the
popular recognition of the abounding prosperity we
now enjoy under Republican legislation. The con
trast between the conditions of the people now and
those which prevailed four years ago constitutes so
strong an argument in favor of the administration it
is hardly likely the people will consent to make an
other trial of government by the party of hard times
and depression.
OUR.NEW PROSPERITY.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 28, 1900.
James G. Burke, a laborer at Buckman's
camp. Fourteenth and Guerrero streets,
had an extensive lacerated wound on his
lips and face switched and dressed at the.
Receiving Hospital yesterday morning.
He said he was walking on Montgomery
street about 11 o'clock * Saturday night,
when two men approached him at Clay
otreet and knocked him down and kicked
him on the face. He says* his assailants
robbed him of $14 and left him uncon
scious on the sidewalk. He reported the
robbery to the police. . .
It now appears that our national pavilion at Paris,
which is so attractive outside, is barc'as a barn within,
and the management, it is said, intends to put in a
number of pot plants and gay carpets to brighten it
up. It would have been better to have made use of
the building to show what Americans can do in the
way of interior decoration, but since the opportunity
has been lost the next best thing will be to send over
a number of officers from the staff of various Govern
ors and put them on daily parade by way of orna
ment. They would be more variegated than plants
and more animated than carpets.

"Lord Chumlcy" was presented by tha
Neill company at the California Theater
last night. The play is one of the best
that Mr. Neill has presented here. The
title* role Is taken by Mr. Neill. and he
plays the self-sacrificing lord with such a
clever effect that one Is in sympathy with
him throughout. The plot deals with a
young lord who suffers poverty to save a
friend from disgrace, and In the second
act where he is found in humble lodgings,
it Is very funny. In the third act every
thing is set right and he wins the girl of
his choice. Benjamin Howard has the
thankless task of assuming the role of
the typical villain, who stops at nothing
to win the girl he loves. George Bloom
quest has a small part as the stoker on a
train. He only appears in the second act.

a merchant who loves Lord CtiVmley with
grace and earnestness. The - rest of thÂ©
cast are good.

is In bad luck and 'goes broke. His fiancee
at the right moment is there with the
bank roll and saves him. Miss Burkhart

California presented herself for State
hood in December. 1S49. She had a popu
lation In excess of the requirement. Most
of it was from the Northern States; some
came from Europe, much from the South
ern State3. The conditions were such as
Imperatively demanded a settled govern
ment. President Taylor, the leading hero
of the war, was thoroughly conversant
The Situation in 1850.
A large number of the members of the
party solemnly pledged themselves to
vote for no man who-was not a declared
opponent to the introduction of slavery
into the Territories. True to this pledge,
the Whigs of the Western Reserve In Ohio
formally repudiated the party nominee
and averred that the Whig party had been
"basely betrayed â ay, sold to the South
ern slaveholder." But they were dis
pleased likewise with the nominee of tfc'e
free-soil party. Many felt that they were
tricked and insulted by the effort to force
them to vote for a life-long Democrat
and a man of Martin Van Buren's princi
ples.
The Wilmot proviso had dealt a blow to
national politics which was ultimately to
rupture the Democratic party permanent
ly, to kill the Whig party outright and to
create (In 1S5C) a new Republican party.
But all this could not have been accom
plished without the lamentable failure of
the Whigs in party wisdom, as well as in
true statesmanship, after their second
rise to power in 184S.
There were Whig anti-slavery "bolters"
also, though in many States the party
maintained a gloomy and anxious silence.
At the same time certain newspaper sup
porters of Taylor ceased not to proclaim
that "the Whig party North is the true
anti-slavery parly of tho republic." and
that the Wilmot proviso "is now and ever
has been the doctrine of the Whigs of the
free States." Oth*>r Northern newspapers
made frequent allusions to "the Whig
principles of the Wilmot proviso."

it never passed the Senate. Still the bare
suggestion was sufficient greatly to inflame

in it was at tirst eagerly adopted in the
North by men of all parties.
The settlement of the status of the pur
chased territory in respect to slavery was
seen by North and South to be imperative,
and Southern Democratic leaders de
termined to oppose the principle of the
Wilmot proviso. Many Northern \\ nig
newspapers declared for it. and. while
seeking to avoid "the untempered zeal and j
fanaticism of the Liberal party." strove |
to commit the Whig to its support. Anti
slavery Whigs hoped by supporting the
Wilmot proviso in the election of 1S43 to
draw all the anti-slavery torces to a
union within the Whig party. But. as we
have seen, the Whigs were again too
timid to promulgate definite party princi
ples, and once more shirked the real issue. <

The panacea for the national disorder pro
posed by the Democratic nominee was the !
principle of "squatter sovereignty," which
would leave the people of each territory
to decide for themselves the question of
freedom or slavery. The Whigs gained
the election through the defection of the
anti-slavery Democrats of New York, but
nothing was settled thereby and both the
abolitionists and the slavery faction grey

Meantime anti-slavery sentiment had
been growing stronger in the Democratic
party as well as among the Whigs. Â¦% arl

Return of the Sierra Excursion
Party â Resolutions Adopted on
the Special Train.
The excursion to the Sugar Pine forest
of Tuolumne County given by the officials
of the Sierra Railway Company and the
West Side Flume and Lumber Comapny
was a remarkable outing. The special
Pullman train which took the San Fran
cisco guests to Carters returned last even
ing. At Sonora and Jamestown, on the
homeward trip, the passengers were pho
tographed. The excursionists, who had
the opportunity to view the obstacles to
railway building which were overcome in
the construction of the road from Carters
Into the forest, held a meeting on the
train and adopted the following:
We. the tindPrslKnpd. guests ofâ the Sierra
Railway Company and the West Side Flume
and Lumber Company on the grand excursion
given on their respective road*Â» on May 25 and
26, 1SC0, desire to express our pleasure for the
entertainment and hospitality of our generous
hosts. As a token of the esteem In which we
hold the officials of said companies we hereby

us by this object lesson, the magnitude of the
enterprise, the generous hospitality extended to
all. renews our faith in the undeveloped riches
of our mountain districts as cne of the many
opportunities of employing local capital.
Second â The courage and enterprise of our
hosts in pushing to a successful completion the
Sierra Railway and the West Side Flume and
Lumber Company road justifies the confidence
and hearty support of the citizens of our State.
Third â We each anil all express our hearty
good will and bes-t wishes for the complete suc
cess of these t;reat enterprises and shall never
forget -the splendid hospitality shown us.

engineer in safely handling the . entire train
under circumstances exceedingly difficult.
Fifthâ To the president, directors and officers
of said companies we convey by these resolu
tions our unqualified thanks for an instructive,
entertaining and satisfactory outing.
The resolutions were jsigned by all the
guests aboard the special train. Among
the signers are many representative men
of the State, whose capital is invested in
great business enterprises.

The United States ship Marion, bright
in a new coat of paint and lively with
the tread of a hundred naval militiamen,
on her decks, tore loose from her moor
ings at Mare Island yesterday and made
her way to her old anchorage off Folsom
street wharf.
Although It was well understood she
was to start some time yesterday, still
when she did start it came as a surprise.
Her engines were getting a little pre
liminary turning over while she was still
fast to the mooring buoy and the strain
becoming too great the mooring shackle
parted and the ship was adrift in the
narrow channel. There was no confu
sion and no delay. Without hesitation
Captain James ordered full speed ahead
and the old ship commenced her voyage
an hour before it was intended, but not
before she was ready.
The guns, the old broadside smooth
bores, the converted pivot rifle and the
Parrott rifie on her forecastle have all
been taken out of lrer and her decks are
now clear and seemingly as broad as a
ballroom. Sh has been painted alow and
aloft. Inside and on deck. Neeetssary
stores have been allowed to her and she
Is in much better condition than at any
time since she became a Naval Reserve
ship. There are some things still want
ing to make her a vessel tit for sea, but
she will probably get all necessary
stores before any outside work is ordered.
The men went up to the yard Saturday.
A large number went on the- Markham,
detailed for that duty at 2 o'clock. More
went up on the first trip of the Monti
cello and still more came ; up with the
band on the last trip of the same vessel,
which brought them to the yard about
midnight.
The run down was made under steam
and fore and aft sails. It was uneventful
and the vessel anchored safely after a
good quick run. The regular routine of
the reserve will be taken up again at once
and the officers and men will enter into
the spirit of the organization with re-

THE congregation of the Beth Mena
chim Streisand held a service yes
terday afternoon to dedicate a new
Sepher Torah for the use of the can
tor. The Sepher Torah is the Testa
ment, or fiye books of Moses, written in
Hebrew on parchment and is Inscribed
by men specially trained In the art. One
of the rolls takes nearly a year to com
plete.
The service of dedication Is usually at
tended by all the congregation "and Is
looked upon as a service of thanksgiv
ing
The height of of the ambition of an
orthodox Jew is to be the possessor of
a Torah. and should he be bo fortunate
he is envied and honored by all his
friends. When a Torah is presented to
the synagogue there are a number of
spaces left in which members of the con
gregation can Inscribe their names. In
wealthy synagogues large sums are paid
for the privilege. The prices bid yester
day were very modest, as the congrega
tion Is composed of humble merchants.
The attendance Â¦was not very large and
Rabbi Levy, who was invited . with a
number of other rabbis to take part In
the. ceremony, spoke very severely at the
lack of Interest shown and the light at
tendance.
The service opened with the chanting
of a psalm by the Rev. Mr. Samuelson,
the rabbi of the synagogue. He was fol
lowed by Rabbi Levy, -who said In part:
"I am very much surprised to see such
a light attendance, but hope there will be
more Interest shown In the future. Your
synagogue is the orthodox place of wor
ship In the city. We have in the West
ern Addition several handsome syna
gogues with learned ministers to lead the
congregations. But If we were not to
have the old orthodox synagogues we
would have no comparison and would
have no old orthodox service to look to.
In these days we do not want to forget
old customs and Ideas. In this service

The New Territory.
The final settlement with ilexieo at
the close of the war gave to the United
States another enormous addition of ter
ritory, which included California. Texas.
Nevada, Utah, New Mexico. Arizona and
parts of Wyoming and Colorado. Shortly
before this, in 1S4C. a treaty with Great
Britain adjusted our northwestern bound
ary and secured an undisputed title to the
States of Oregon and Washington. This,
with the Gadsden purchase from Mexico
in 1S53 of a strip lying south of Arizona
and New Mexico, fixed the boundaries of
the United States as they still remain.
While the ratification of the Mexican
treaty was still pending occurred the dis
covery of gold in California, which led
amid great excitement to the pouring in of
a flood of adventurous population, hetero
geneous in character, but much of it rough
and lawless, and all moved by the over
mastering greed of gold. The whole of the
territory aeuuired from Mexico (Texas ex
cepted) was inhabited by Mexicans, Span
iards and Indians, none of them capable
without long training of appreciating and
accepting the principles of free govern
ment as understood by Anglo-Saxons.
Here were conditions to tax the
strength, the wisdom and the vital assim
ilating force of the most powerful, the
most experienced and the most united of
States. But the United States was weak
ened by sectional divisions: every prob
lem of statesmanship Â¦which aroso Â¦was
now complicated by the Inevitable slaverv
question, and its discussion embittered by
the personal feeling which every allusion
to slavery aroused. Thoughtful patriots
looked Hnxiously into the future. Should
the new possessions be dedicated to free-
I dom or to slavery? Could North and South
agree upon a division? Texas was con
ceded to slavery; what should be done
with the rest?
The Wilmot Proviso.
At the very outbreak of the Mexican
war it was foreseen that the result would
be an addition to the possessions of the
United States and that such accessions
would unavoidably involve divided opin
ions respecting the extension of slavery
to the new soil. A bill was before the
House In 1S46 to appropriate money for the
purchase of territory from Mexico, when
David Wilmot, a Democratic member from
Pennsylvania and a warm friend of the
administration, moved to attach to the
bill a proviso "forever excluding slavery
from any territory so gained. Von Hoist
likens the proposal of such a measure to
"the springing of a mine which shook
both the Union and slavery to their very
foundations." The amendment passed the

with the situation and urged on the movÂ»Â«
ment for entering: the Union. Slavery
was excluded, by Mexican law. from the
whole of the newly purchased territory
and the constitution adopted by the Cali
fornia convention expressly prohibited it.
The South, under a Democratic admin
istration, had brought on the war for the
sake of maintaining and extending South
ern power through the extension of slavo
territory. The outcome had been the ac
quisition of a domain far exceeding its
hopes. Â«But now It appeared that free
dom might gain more than slavery, after
all, and California, the richest province
of the whole, threatened to slip at once
from Southern grasp. Pro-slavery Whigs
united with the Democrats In opposing
the admission of California unless tho
Government would give assurances of
protection to the interests of slavery In
the rest of the new purchase, and they
called upon the President to aid them in
their purpose by refusing his signature to
the California bill. The stern old warrior
answered that he would sign any consti
tutional law passed by Congress, and led
his questioners to infer that he favored
the application of the \Vilmot proviso to
the Territories. To threats by Southern
Congressmen that they would dissolve
the Union he replied by declaring himself
ready to take the field in person to en
force his country's laws and to hang
without mercy the very statesmen to
whom he spoke should they be taken in
rebellion, lie was to t>e no tool of the
slave, power it was clear. Indeed, his
chief counselor was now the young and
ardent William H. Seward of New York,
whose far-sighted aim it was to make the
Whig party the great exponent and agent
of the opposition t<> sla.very extension.
This sentiment had always existed In
all the States North and South: It had al
ways been strong: in the Whig party and
was gaining ground in the Democratic
party. .Northern abolitionists (with the
exception of the extreme Garriaonlam
wing, which was always numerically
small) woulil have been won by a sincere
and straightforward course on the part
of the Whips to a hearty allegiance to that
party. Harl Taylor lived and had the oth
er Whiff leaders been able to see that now
as never before there lay before them an
opportunity to make their party a truly
national party â a compact, fully organized
political force based upon an Issue in.

had they but held calmly and firmly to
the principles already associated with thÂ©
party name, the principles of non-interfer

States and unflinching resistance to slav

the aftercourse of our history have been
different. The times were ripe as never
before for the final triumph of national

The success of the outing was due to the
following committees:
Fully 5001 eagles and kindred b'rds
spread their wings and flew over to
Scbuetzen Park, where they spent the
day dancing, swinging and merrymaking.
Numerous prizes were awarded to the
sprightly members of both sexes and to
the fortunate ones who held lucky gate
coupons. The games on the cinder path
attracted a large crowd, and the partici
pants In the various events received great
encouragement, from the onlookers.
Every prominent politician, ofliee-holder
and popular member of local fraternal
organizations were present to add eclat
to the ouiing. Good order was maintained
throughout the day by a committee com
posed of husky eagles. Iiut one disturb
ance was obseVved, and that was due to
a fresh youth who. having been struck
with a bartowel, imagined himself in
toxicated. He was quickly subdued, but
managed to "land" on a committeeman's
"lamp." necessitating a new shade for
the injured optic. Dick Madden was pres
ent with his famous goat "Boscow." A
number of Eagles were initiated by the
festive members and were compelled to
E" " AGLES flew high at Schuetzen Park
yesterday. The occasion of their
lofty flight was the second annual
* picnic of the fraternal order which
takes its name after the noble American
bird. The emblems of freedom strutted
round the picturesque grounds, fluttered
their wings and screeched their joy with
pleasure at being: free from care and woe.
Every fair lady bird prceked her pretty
plumage and hopped around the spacious
pavilion to the sweet strains of an excel
lent band. The park was tilled with bald
eagles, birds plentifully supplied with lop
nots and birds adorned in gaudy plumage.
They left their aeries in the morning and
brought their young and their lunches
with them.
ride the animal, much to the pleasure of
the onlookers. Much to the regret of his
cwner, VBoscovv" became intoxicated.
This was due to his unquenchable thirst.
The goat would "butt" in every time a
Hock of eagles gathered at a refreshment
stand. "Boscow" would make his wants
known by a plaintiff "bah" and his appeal
would prove irresistible. Tho goat after
ward amused himself fcy feeding on the
bon mots dropped by genial Ed Head,
Harry Hrennan and other wits.
The members of the committee who had
the outlnp in hand were dazzling: in their
yachting costumes and gaudy badges of
authority. They could be distinguished
much quicker than a local policeman with
stripe? down his trousers. President Head
was in his clement. Every time he
wanted to make a speech to the as
semblage a tuneful toot on a cornet ap
prised the expectant crowd and then he
would "spiel." He presented Oscar Han
sen with a beautiful sold badge for sel
ling the most picnic tickets, informed his
auditors that an anxious mother was
peeking a lost child and announced that
g:tte prizes would be drawn In the open.
His spÂ»-pches were models of rhetoric and
declamation. Following was the result of
the games:

SAN FRAXCISCO.
An extra inr.inp was necessary to de
cide the morning game at Oakland. From
the start to the nnish the playing was of
the kind that the fanatics admire, and
even Hank Harris was satisfied with the
performance of his men until the tenth,
and then Iburg was hit hard three sep
arate times.
Another change was instituted In the
positions of the local team. Schwartz was
switched to the middle bag and Reiliy
put in at short stop. This arrangement
made a. stronger in-iield cf the team, and
were It not for a brace of errors by Pee
ples the Infield work would have been per
fect.
Babbitt pitched an emergency pame and
It was twirling of the highest class. Only
Mx hits were registered oft his delivery.
Although Iburg was punished for thirteen
hits, the Slough City men found it a dif
ficult task to push their three men over
the plate. In the tenth the fates cast
their black blankets over L'ncle's shoul
ders and the winning run was made by
Streib's hit to right tield. The score:
Stockton 3, San Francisco 2.

STOCKTON"
What a happy seventh inning it was for
Frisco: Kelliy bunted and reached first
untouched, but Krug did not come up to
his three-Dagger pace. Hying out. To tho
consternation of ail, F112 swatted out a
two-bagger to ri.^ht. Boon after Uroekhoff
took a. constitutional and the bags were
filled. No bunt this fime, for Hlkiebrand
was up and he did somethingâ a single -
scoring Rellly and Fltrpatrick. BrockhofT
crossed the rubber on the throw-in from
letl on Schwartz's out. Sullivan made the
uiird out.
1 he ninth began to present a few blue
sireaks for the local chances of victory.
I'ace walked to t,rst and a three-bugger
by Streib sent him over the rubber. Mc-
Carthy's out scored Streib and the game
read Han Francisco 4, Stockton 3. Morrow
liew to Hrockhcff ami Courtney made first
on Krug's trrcr. Moore struck out and
the game was over. Tho score:
With two men on the slabs in the sec
ond innn;g, Stockton scored its first run.
Morrow made his tirst bag by a hit to cen
ter, took two Lags more on Courtney's
well-placed hit to short and scored on a
wild throw by fltzpatrics.
Tne game uraggeu uiv.ii the sixth inning,
when tnÂ«' spavined locals, with tne aid of
ilarper, set tne bleacners palpitating.
BrocKhoft went to the urst station on four
bad on--?. A bunt by Hildebrana Tilled the
first half section at bags. A sacrifice by
Schwartz advanced Drocxhoff and Hilde
brand to third and second and Sullivan
walKed to rir^t, crowuing the sacks. The
tans were restless when habst came to
the plate, but the second ball thrown was
bunted 10 Btreib and UrocKhoff crossed
the plate on Pabst's out. Levy's out re
tired the locals to the ber.cnos.
At last Uncle Henry's loose-jointed,
spavined and out-at-the-knees team has
won a game on merit. All the local fa
natics were surprised yesterday afternoon
at Recreation 1'arK wnen this uncommon
event came to pass. The astonlsnment has
not yet ceased.
Again did the local team appear on the
field with the petitions of the men chang
ed. Krug, wno ha3 been serving at a
restful Joo on the bencnes, was placed at
third. Iuilly covering short and Schwartz
second. This provea the best arrangement
that the experiments have so far snowed.
Krug also returned wt.a a section of his
batting- eye, the longest hit of the day
coming from his stick, although it produc
ed no results. Both Harper and Fitzpat
rick pitched excellent ball. The errors
were nut a stroke apiece lor the contest
ing nines.

The attendance was unusually large,
and although the weather was boister
ous, the coursing was generally of the
highest class. The detailed results of tho
running, with Judge John Grace's official
scores, follow:
The deciding course was a long one.
Palo Alto and Warship ran for one min
ute and six seconas. Palo Alto was a
5 to 1 favorite, and never left the result
In doubt, winning by a score of 11 to 7.
The sapling staKe was won cleverly by-
Judge P. J. Reilly's Early Dawn, whelped
May 7 of last year. She had some severe
running on Saturday, and showed the ef
fects of its yesterday. PI Fi led from the
slips, but Early Dawn gradually put on
more steam and won by 14 points to 2.
The open stake wa.-t replete with close
courses and a number of upsets for the
talent. In the second round Brutus,
which many thought would win* the
stake, was retired by Kid McCoy at qdds
of 6 to 1. The hare favored the "Kid"
throughout, and he shut Brutus out
pointless. In the fourth round the "Kid"
had a severe course with Sara and won.
The next time out he met Sir Pasha and
was beaten, scoring only by favor of
the hare. The deckling course was won
by Risky Attempt. The black son ol
Emin Pasha and Minnehaha finished
strongly, his opponents having the best
of the early part of the course. Sir Pasha
made a dive for the hare, but missed his
mark. Had he killed at this time he
would have won. Aa it was he weakened
and was beaten out.
Eugene Geary's young greyhound Palo
Alto won hi.* second champion stake of
the month yesterday at Union Coursing
Park. He defeated Luxor In the semi
final round and disposed of Judse P. J.
Reilly's Warship In the all-important de
ciding course. His course with Luxor
was the sensational one of the day, the
spectators cheering both greyhounds as
they ran up -the field. Luxor was fa
vorite at odds varying from 5 to 3 to 5
to 4Â»i, the bulk of the wagering, which
was heavy, going: in at 5 to 4. The
hare proved a strong one, and took the
brace of greyhounds well across the field.
Talo Alto led all the way, taking the
first turn two and a half lengths in ad
vance of the San Jose dog. Alter scoring
live points rapidly he placed Luxor for
one and was himself placed lor one. Lux
or secured one more turn and killed, the
score being 6 points to 4 In favor or
Palo Alto.
Judge Reilly's Early Dawn "Wins the
Sapling Stake at Union Park

A POPULAR MISTAKE
! Regarding Remedies for Dyspepsia
and Indigestion.
I The national disease of Americans Is In-
digestion, or In Its chronic form, dyspep-
! sla, and for the very reason that it is so
! common many people neglect taking
j proper treatment for what they consider
trilling stomach trouble, when as a mat-
! ter of fact indigestion lays the foundation
for many Incurable diseases. No person,
with a vigorous, healthy stomach will fall
a victim to consumption. Many kidney
j diseases and heart troubles date their be-
i ginning from poor digestion; thin, nervous
i people are really so because their stom-
j achs are out of gear; weary, languid,
faded out women owe their condition to
imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you me?t it
j afflicted with weak digestion It is not sur-
l prising that nearly every secret patent
I medicine on . the market claims to be a
cure for dyspepsia, as well as a score of.
other troubles, when, in fact, as Dr.
Werthler says, there is but one genuine
dyspepsia cure which 13 perfectly safe anil
I reliable, and. moreover, this remedy is not
I a patent medicine, but it is a scientific
! combination of pure pepsin (free from an -
I mal matter), vegetable essences. fruU
! salts and bismuth. It Is sold by drupglsia
I under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
I Tablets. No extravagant churns are madd
for them, but for Indigestion or any stom-
ach trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are far ahead of any remedy yet discov-
ered They act on the food eaten; no
dieting is necessary: simply eat all tho
wholesome food you want, and ;heso tab â¢
lets will digest it. A cure results. beca US ,
all the stomach needs is a rest, which
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give by doing
the work of digestion.

that all men are more or less hypocrites.
He said that charity should be extended

Julian Rix has a couple of landscapes

Sidney J. Yard of San Jose shows some
rood watercolors this week In the local
galleries. They are mostly sketches
around and about Monterey. Mr. Yard
has been happy In catching the California
glowâ sometimes. This artist's work Is
curiously unequal, both in color and man
ner. Oftentimes brilliant, clear and quite
convincing in color. It Is occasionally mud
dy and off key. While characteristically
rather hard, almost photographic in meth
od. It sometimes, though seldom, lapses
Into a soft woollineiÂ«s like that of some
old English watercolors. But Mr. Yard
reaches a high artistic level in his bÂ»-st
work, where the tendency to excess of de
tail is restrained and his true and lumin
ous color sense comes uppermost.
W. L. Judson of Los Angeles has an
interesting autumn landscape on exhibi
tion in one of the galleries. He has a
broad technique, nice ~-neeption of tone

Abner Ellis, a mining expert, writing
from Juneau early in March, says that
several hundred men at Nome have spent
the entire winter locating thousands of
claims for themselves and for others by
power of attorney. It is yet unknown at
Nome whether the powers of attorney
will be recognized by the Federal officers
arriving this summer to administer the
laws.

American Sugar Company to Open
Stock Yards Near Oxnard.
Special Dispatch to The Call
VENTURA. May 27.-The official an
nouncement is made that the American
Beet Sugar Company will establish near
Oxnard mammoth stockyards, involving
the expenditure of thousands of dollars
The exact location Is not yet determined"
but it will be between Oxnard and the
ocean, possibly along the shore, which is
four miles from the sugar factorv The
company will at once lay a railroad track
to a suitable tract of- land and establish
stock-feeding yards. It will erect build
ings for the accommodation of the neces
sary force of men to handle from 3000 to
5000 head of stock. Silos will be built so
as to use the beet puln during the entire
year. Both cattle and sheep fatten ran-
Jdly on beet pulp. * l n rap
During the last season at the factorv no
systematic use was made of the beet nuln
after the saccharine matter was extracted
The bulk of the pulp went with the waste
water to the ocean. By the establishment
of Ftock-feedfnsj yards it is proposed to
utilize all of the beet pulp. Stock in ears
can be taken direct to the yards or
brought in by boat and shipped out when
fattened and ready for the market In the
same manner. The company with Its own
rolling stock can take the beet pulp as It
comes from the factory to the silos. In
this connection is also contemplated the
encouraging of the establishing of an ex
tensive creamery plant. When the loca
tion of the yards is settled the company
will make further announcements concern
ing its new investment.

"OAKLAND, May 27.â The police raided
the klnetoscope parlors of Green & Ken
dall on Seventh street near Broadway,
to-night, arresting Frank Green, one of
the proprietors of the place, ana confiscat
ing thirteen of the nickel-in-the-slot ue
vlces. The charge against Green is that
of exhibiting obscene pictures. The ac
tion of the police was tha result of Â»rÂ«Â»,, s
refusal to remove the boxes after notifica
tion yestemav from police headquarters
rnat the exhibition ot the alleged obiec
tionable views would no longer be tol
erated.
Report was made to Chief Hodgkins by
Night Captain of Police Peterson concern-
Ing the nature of the pictures and the
proprietors were told that they must cease
showing them in connection with their
phonographs. This afternoon Captain of
Police Wilson inspected the pictures, some
of which hatl been removed since yester
day's order was made. His report upon
them was the same as that of Captain
Peterson. Sergeant McKinley, under or
ders from Captain Peterson, raided the
establishment to-night and all of the ma
chines were sent to the City Prison. Green
was released on a $100 bond. Complaints
against him will be sworn to to-morrow
by the police.
Green has retained Attorney L.. S.
Church and says he will fight the police.
This Is the first raid upon such devices
which the police have made In this city.
They claim that their action was warrant
ed in that the moving views which have
been on exhibition are, according to the
reports of both police captains, of such
a character as to be within the meaning
of the State law under which the raid was
maae.

This ha.Â« been a â¢wreek of vital interest to the

have undoubtedly won their fight with the

down in a most cold-blooded manner by a few
men who had given their word of hono. to

referred to to by the conference committee.

not hesitate to say that it knocked everything:
into a corked hat and prevented a moat suc
cessful adjustment of the cherry question, and
given the growers a frreat prestige in the
future.
The growers have come to the conclu
sion that the fruit season Is already upon
them, and that it is too late to do much
for the present year, but they are work
ing on the project for an independent can
nery that will be outside of the combine
and operated by the growers themselves.
This seems to be the solution of the
problem lhat confronts the growers.
Meanwhile they have an organization that
Is an excellent basis upon which to work,
and which will develop into a fruit ex

The Havwards Journal charges that the
attempted corner in cherries was broken
by some one Inside the growers' organiza
tion. It says:

Mr. English proposes to make a gen
eral tour of the Alaskan coast and may
go as far as St. Michael before he reaches
Cape Nome., His son. Norrls English,
who Is a mining engineer, departed a week
ago for that mecca of gold Keekers.
The absence of Mr. English leaves little
probability of a contest among the Ala
meda County Democrats for representa
tion in the national convention. The
County Committee has arranged all pre
liminaries for a primary election for dele
gates to the State convention, but the pri
maries will, to all appearances, be merely
a formal selection of those men who will
be selected by the various ward and town
ship eommitteemen.
The nature of Mr. English's enterprise
in the north has not been disclosed. It is
understood that he goes with a definite
purpose In view and that he has strong
reasons for believing he will meet with
linancial success.
Before Mr. English tlocided to venture
into Alaskan projects he had been men
tioned as a possible candidate for dele
gate from the Third Congressional Dis
trict to the Democratic National Conven
tion. Ills departure from the State elimi
nates him from consideration.
"Warren M. English, the Democratic pol
itician, has abandoned the strife of party
feud to seek fortune In the Alaskan
v.ilds. The well-known v/arhorse will
leave to-morrow for the north, to take
steamer for the tipper coast. His desti
nation will eventually be Cape Nome, but
for the present the traveler has some in
terests in other sections of the Territory
to which he will give attention.

CRAZY JOURNALISM.
Newspapers Published by Lunatics
for Lunatics. \
Dotted here and there over the earth are
little colonies whose inhabitants are cut \
off from all intercourse with the every- !
day world by their own idiosyncrasies.
Each individual lives in a world of his or
her own creation, which, in the majority
of cases, only two outside interests ever
succeed in reaching â namely, the asylum
doctor and the asylum magazine. I
In some ca^es the proof sheets are just
glanced at by the head doctor before tne
magazine goes to press, but the/ are
written, printed and published by the in
mates tliemselvc-s.
Although America produced the first
two lunatic journals, to Scotland belongs
the credit of having started the first paper
of this kind which has survived its in
fancy. In fact, the birth of lunatic jour
nalism took place when the first number
of the New Moon was issued from the
Crichton Royal Asylum. Dumfries, on De
cember 3, 1S44. Since that date the follow- |
ing have been successfully launched: The
Morningslde Mirror, from the Royal Edin
burgh Asylum; the Excelsior, from lames
Murray's Royal Asylum, Perth; the Fort
England Mirror, Grahamstown, South
Africa; the Murthly Magazine, from the
Perth County Asylum; Lnder the Dome,
the organ of Bethlehem Royal Hospitai,
London, and The Conglomerate, which be
longs' to the Middletown Asylum, New
York.
These magazines touch the journalistic
Ideal, as, being written by the readers
for their amusement, they cannot fail to
hit tho popular taste. We find that those
mentally deranged like about four-ninths
of their reading to take the form of travel
and heavy prose articles of a strictly the
oretical nature. The rest of the contents
comes in order of quantity as follows:
Humor, local notes, poetry, chiefly in a
light vein; special articles oh local the
atrical an>l fiction.
The most striking feature about these
journals Is the 'almost total absence of
gloom and melancholia, and we have it
on the word of the doctor of one of the
leading asylums that this is not owing
to such contributions being tabooed. But
now and again one comes on a poem or
tale drenched with melancholia and mor
bid insanity. In one of these journals ap
peared a story written in the ilrst person
about a hero â undoubtedly the writer â
who had his head twisted round the
wrong way. The consequence was he in
variably hnd to walk In the opposite di
rection to which he wanted to walk. This
terrible fate haunts him right through
the story, causing him to lose friends,
money and everything else which man
holds dear anrt ends up by his, in his own
mind, murdering the girl who was to save
him from himself.
According to the story the heroine was
standing on the edge of a great precipice.
The hero is standing near. Suddenly the
heroine becomes giddy and totters on the
brink. The hero tries to dash forward
and save her, but of course runs the other
way. Here comes a break in the nar
rative, which is finished by the follow
ing Fentence: "And the gates of an asy
lum for those mentally deranged shut the
writer off from his friends in the outer
world."
Apart from such trapedies as the above,
the whole of these journals are saturated
with humor. In one we lind the follow
ing among "Questions We Want An
swered":
"When doe3 the Queen of Sheba in
tend to recotmlze the royal rank of the
â¢Prince of Wales?' Did Marie Corelli'
really tweak the doctor's nose? "Why
did 'Ranji' throw the ball at 'W. G.'s*
head during the practice at the nets,?'
Perhaps it should be explained that tne
celebrities referred to above are not those
known to the public, but other persons
who claim their personalities and are de
tained in the asylums for that very rea
son.
\ A writer in The Fort England Mirror
gives the following reason for his de
tention: "I met a young widow with a
Erown stepdaughter, and the widow mar
ried me. Then my father, who was a
widower, met my stepdaughter and mar
ried her. That made my wife the mother
in-law of her father-in-law and made my
stepdaughter my mother and my father
my stepson. Then my stepmother, the
stepdaughter of my wlfo, had a son.
That boy was, of course, my brother,
because he was my father's son. He was
also the son of my wife'3 stepdaughter
and therefort? her grandson. That made
me grandfather to my stepbrother. Then
my wife had a son. My mother-in-law,
the stepsister of my son. is also his grand
mother, because he is her stepson's child.
My father is the brother-in-law of my
child, because his stepsister is his wife.
I am the brother of my own son. who is
also the child of my step-grandmother.
I am mv mother's brother-in-law, my
wife is -her own child's aunt, my son is
my father's nephew, and I'm my own
grandfather. And after trying to ex
; plain the relationship in our family some
seven times a day to our calling friends
for a fortnight. I was brought hereâ no,
came of my own will."
Another declares thnt he never found
rest from his mother-in-law before, and
'he intends to hoodwink the doctors as
long as possible. And yet another points
out that* it ha.Â« always been the fate nt
really preat men to be Ijrnored or ill
treated by their contemporaries, and that
is why he is now detained. "For the
thick skulls and those of little sense are
jealous of my beinsr the first to discover
that we could all live forever if we would
only walk on our heads instead of our
feet." â London Mail.

young friends to a party in her mother's
house, 36>Â£ Shipley street. Saturday night
and the "growler" was rushed with
alarming frequency. Peart delighted her
friends with her songs and when she sang
"I'd Leave My Happy Home for You"
they all joined in the chorus. *
The neighbors complained to Policeman
McQuaide about the noise shortly before
midnight, and he summoned two other
officers to his assistance and raided the
house. Pearl was arrested together with
h*r friends, LJllie Newman. Celia New
man, Anthony Cooper. J. Kelly, Frank

MADE NIGHT HIDEOUS
WITH THEIR REVELRY
He accepted their hospitality and the
trio entered the saloon of Johnny Daley,
on the corner of Howard and Third
streets, where they indulged in liquid re
freshments. Later the men invited Tucker
to take a ride into the country, where
they said a friend of theirs resided. He
accepted the invitation and they boarded
a Folsom-street trolley car. transferring
to a Bryant, thence to Mission street, and
rode as far as Noe and Twenty-ninth,
where the oar stops. Tucker's friends
told him their country- friend, lived. Just
across a vacant lot, wnich they proceeded
to traverse. When they got about half
way across the lot one of the men dealt
Tucker a blow on the side of the head
with some blunt Instrument, which ren
dered him unconscious. While ha was in
this condition they relieved him of his
gold watch and chain and some silver
coin he had In his pockets.
When Tucker regained his senses he
reported his experience to the people
whom he met. who in turn informed Po
lice Officer Thomson, who does patrol
duty In that vicinity.
The officer called to his assistance Pa
trolman Stanley, and the pair set to work
on the case. After hunting: about the
place for some time they caught sight of
two . men crossing the ; northern slope of
Twin Peaks. The Idetf struck the officers
that these men were heading for the Cas
tro-street cars. In order to intercept them
they hurried over the hill, and as they
arrived at Castro street they saw the men
on a car. The car was stopped and the
men questioned.- They denied ' knowing
each other and seated that tiiey were out
for a Sunday, walk and were returning
home.
On being searched Tucker's gold watch
was found in Connolly's back pocket, with
$3 25 In silver.

ARREST OF TWO
HIGHWAY ROBBERS
IN THE MISSION
In his petition Mr. Grant claims that
the Supervisors had no power either to
abolish the Industrial School or to substi
tute in its place any such institution as
the Magdalen- Asylum. There are now
over 700 Inmates of the place, and should
the contention of the plaintiff prevail not
one of them could be held. It has for
years been the custom to send women
who appeared before the courts, particu
larly the lower courts, to the Magdalen
Asylum for tne remainder of their,minor
ity if they happened to be under age and
if not for any comparatively short sen
tence. ............. .;. â¢ .
Attorney Hugh Grant, counsel for the
plaintiff, claims that the case Is one to
decide whether or not the Supervisors can
override the enactment of the Legisla
ture. In 1S58 the Legislature established
in this city an institution known as the
Industrial School, to which minor offend
ers were sentenced by the courts. In 1883,
however, the Supervisors passed an ordi
nance abolishing the Industrial School
and substituting in its place an Institu
tion which became known as the Mag
dalen Asylum. This was to be run by
the sisters of the Catholic church and
they were to have certain allowances for
the support of such inmates as were sent
there by the courts.
A suit that will determine the legal
standing of the Magdaleri Asylum will
come before the Supreme Court for argu
ment this afternoon on the question of
whether or not the asylum has the right
to hold in custody Mattie Wyckoff. who
was sentenced to serve the remainder of
her minority there by Judge Mogan. She
was sentenced nearly three months ago
but upon application for a writ* of habeas
corpus she was released and Is now
in the charge of her mother, who is plain
tiff In the suit. Policeman Cavanaugh of
the California-street station and Police
man McMurray of the Society for the
Suppression of Cruelty to Children have
had the case in hand. They spent last
evening in looking up the girl's record
and securing information in regard to her
that may be used in the arguments to
day.
Suit Involving the Legality
of Sentences of Court

ATTACK ON THE
RIGHTS OF THE
MAGDALEN HOME
Ere. r.OrKOKPKT, the policeman
who was arrested Saturday night
while lunnlng amuck in the West
Â» frn Addition, threatening to kill
people with a. re%'olver. was booked at the
City Prison yesterday morning on a
charge cf assault with a deadly weapon.
He was released on $30 cash bail on the
order cf Judge Frank H. Dunne of the
Superior Court.
Chief Sullivan had Boukofsky brought
to his office yepterday morning. When
asked for an explanation of his conduct
he said he had boon crazy drunk and re
membered nothing cf what had occurred
after h>- left the place where he spent
the afternoon. He toak a drink there, the
lirpt for six months, and that he supposed
h;id driven him crazy.
The Chief informed him that he had
gore into the grocery and saloon at the
corner cf Geary and Leaven worth streets
about 5:30 o'clock and had ordered the
proprietor to el^se the place, as there was
a piile entrance. The grocer refused, an*!
Uoukofsky compromised by getting two
or three drinks. About 7:30 o'clock he
went into the Trilby saloon, on O'Fairc-ll
end Taylor streets, and ordered a drink.
.While thÂ»- bartender was preparing the
Â«1rink Bouitoffelcy pulled out his revolver
end fired a bullet Into a music box. Then
the Chief to!d him of holding up P. O.
Prisc-oll. the frxinman. in a vacant lot at
Jackson and Lyon streets, and firing a
shot at Special Officer Helbush.
â¢"Now." t-aid the Chief, "you as an of
ficer are clothed with authority to protect
th^ lives and property of citizens, but in-
Ftead of that you imperiled their lives.
. I phall prefer a charge against you of
assault with a deadly weapon for shooting
.at Special Officer Helbush. and it will be
pressed to a finish. You are suspended
from duty and charges will also be pre-
It is at this point of the story that
"Luckys" luck reasserted itself. The
drayman who was engaged to deliver the
poods to the $2Q<)0 customer knew but one
Baldwin. "Lucky" was speechless when
the cast- of wine and other good things
were delivered to him. He concluded that
a firm that could afford to be so generous
to a man who bought a bill of good*
amounting to scarcely $200 should be ad
vised of his appreciation. And he wrote
thar.kirj? Mr. Ayers and Mr. Merrill for
their kindnctf. He went further and told
them that ir he needed a paper of tacks
or a keg of nails when he reached Nome
he would send to the San Francisco firm
fop the goods and he would not expect
any champagne in return, either.
Both the Valencia with "I.ucky" Bald
win and the St. Paul with his namesake
were out in the stream when the note
reached the office of Holbrook. Merrill &
Stetson. "Lucky" was emptying a small
bottle to the health of the firm and shout
ing its praises. H. H. Baldwin, aboard
the St. Paul, was mumbling to himself
that they never even said "Thank you"
when he paid that $2000 bill and Grove
Ayers was chasing the. drayman to reÂ»
cover the price of the wine and things
that had gone wrong through "LÂ»ucky's"
1UCK*
Grove Ayers and Mr. Merrill, with cus
tomary generosity, concluded It would be
the proper thing to send their big cus
tomer a token of their appreciation on the
eve of his departure. A case of wine and
several boxes of dainties not to be had
on shipboard were purchased. A letter
couched in the most touching terms was
written to send with the little remem
brance. "Mr." Baldwin was wished a.
pleasant Journey, a safe return and all
that sort of thing. The hope was ex
pressed that the wine would cheer him on
the way.
"There are indications that the good for
tune which followed E. J. Baldwin In his
palmy days and from which he gained the
title of "Lucky" has returned to him. At
least a large chunk of it is on the way to
Xome with him aboard the steamer Valen

i When he was laying In his supplies for
his northern trip he purchased $200 worth
of goods from Holbrook, Merrill & Stet

lously small amount of ball Chief Sulli
van sent Detectives McMahon and Dillon
to rearrpst him. He was found at his
home and taken into custody. At the CKv
Prison the alsgraced policeman pleaded
with Chief Sullivan to fix the ball

marked. "I enn give ten "tlmea the

Chief Sullivan refused to fix the ball

by the Commissioners, and that ended it.

5TEVE M. HARDING, a young des
perado, is once more in the hands of
the police, and this time they con
fidently anticipate being able to
send him to the penitentiary.
Harding is charged vlth burglary and
asgault with a dr.sd.y weapon. On trie
night of April 10 Alfred Jackson, a book
maker living at 137 O'Farrell street, was
lying In bed smoking a cigarette and rea3
irg a newspaper before dropping off to
sleep. T-.vo gas jets were burning in his
room. When Jackson flnifehed smoking
he leaned over to drop the cigarette stub
into a cuspidor close to his bed, but It
hit the edge and rolled on to the carpet.
Jackson bent down to havo the carpet
from being singed and his eyes rested up
on the form of a man underneath the beu.
JackFor. was paralyzed fur a moment,
and while he was debating within himself
what was best to be done the burglar
crawled from under the tied with a revolv
er in his right hand and, pointing it at
Jackson, wno had Jumped out of bed.

Jackson is a tall, well-built man, but
looking into the muzle of the revolver
knocked all the fight out of Mm. He had
about $500 in gold In a purse in his trou
sers pocket, which he was anxious to save.
"There Is all my money," he said, as
he pointed to about eighty cents in small
change on a table. "You can take that
a " I want your money." retorted the burg
lar, and with his left hand he shook Jack
son's coat and vest, always keeping the
revolver pointed at him. There was no
jingle of coin and the burglar lost pa
tience
"If vou don't give me your money at
once "" he said, "you will be a corpse on
the floor and 1 will be out of the door.
Jackson seeing the burglar meant busi
ness, begged for mercy and began to yell
for help The burglar became alarmed
and dashed out of the room.
J P. McKenzle. the landlord of the
house, was attracted, by Jackson s cries
and got to his door just as the burglar.
Boukofsky on the Warpath and in Jail.
A few months later he was arrested on
a charge of grand larceny for stealing
about $200 worth of jewelry from the room
of S. K. Overgoad in the News Building.
He was also acquitted on that charge in
the Superior Court on October 16 last.
Harding is 21 years of age and of gen
tlemanly appearance. He came here from
Kentucky three years ago. He got em
ployment as a bellboy In the Palace Hotel,
but was dismissed on suspicion of steal
ing from the rooms of guests. He made
the acquaintance of H. Charles, a young
man Â¦ who owned the cigar stand in the
St. Nicholas Hotel. Charles wore a valua
ble diamond stud and kept considerable
money in his room in the St. Nicholas.
One night in December, 1898, Harding se
creted himself In Charles* room and when
Charles was asleep he attempted to chlo
roform and rob him. lie was arrested
on a charge of burglary and was held
to answer on January 18, 1890. Two days
later he was held to answer on another
charge of burglary for breaking Into the
room of J. F. Pfetch in the News Build-
Ing on Geary street and stealing a revolv
er and pair of opera glasses. He was ac
quitted on both charges in the Superior
Court through lack of evidence.
"What's the matter?" asked McKenzle.
Harding struck him on the breast, knock
ing him aside and flourishing his revolver,
dashed past him.
The police were at once notified and
since, then Detectives Dinan and Wren had
been looking for Harding. They found
him late Saturday night In a saloon at
Fourth and Minna streets and locked him
up In the tanks. Yesterday morning
Jackson and McKenzle called at the City
Prison. Harding was placed among seven
other men and they at once picked him
out. McKenzle knew him personally, as
Harding lived for a week in his house.
It Is supposed that while living at the
house Harding had become aware of the
fact that Jackson was in the habit of car
rying from $300 to $500 in his pockets. His
intention apparently was to lie under the
bed till Jackson was alseep and then chlo
roform him and go through his pockets.
Some Incidents in Harding's Career.

The Lowry brothers are well known in
amateur sporting circles. Herbert has
played third base in several local baseball
teams, and Russell represents the Phila
delphia Sporting Life here.
Miss George was formerly a. resident of
Modoc County. Her father died there
but her mother is still alive and residing
in this city.
Lucky does n/)t like Herbert Lowry
as one who aspires to be his si9ter-in-law
should, and he narrowly escaped personal
injury when he accompanied Detective
Anthony to her room Saturday night In.
search of' his brother. Luckv and her
girl friend flew at him with feathers
Epread and claws unsheathed, and he was
forced to flee from the room. Detective
Anthony has dropped the case altogether
and says it is up to the Alameda County
officers to arrest Russell if they want to.
The boy formerly worked in Placer
County, but Detective Anthony does not
think either he or the woman he would
have married would go there.
John E. Lowry. father of the young
man who wanted to enter the marital
state so early in life, is chief engineer
at the Occidental Hotel. The family re
sides at 1617^ Webster street.
At 7 o'clock yesterday morning Miss
George, or Lucky, as she is familiarly
known around the beer halls, left the Al
dine house, 404 Turk street, in company
with her bosom friend, Viola Petit, a.' Sac
ramento girl. Miss George carried a hand
Batchel and telescope basket and said she
was going to join her honey-boy in Placer
County.
"I purpose holding a consultation to
morrow with the District Attorneys of
San Francisco and Alameda counties, with
the object of having a. warrant issued for
this woman's arrest on a charge of ab
ductlng my brother. He is.under age, and
she had no right to run away with him
or to be with him now."
"Because he Isn't married. I found that
out in Oakland to-day. This woman told
Captain Seymour they were married by
Rev. J. S. McDonald of the First Pres
byterian Church. I went to him and he
denied ever having seen such a couple.
More than this, they never will be mar
ried in Alameda County on that license,
for nobody will marry them.
"Why don't you simply a^k for the an
nullmtnt of the marriage if he is under
age?"
"You don't Intend to press the charge
of perjury against Russell, though, do
youv" was asked.
"Well, I don't know." said Herbert.
"I'll see when we get hold of him."
"He isn't saying anything," replied
Herbert. "He has turned the whole mat
ter over to me by giving me a power of
attorney and making m,e Russell's guard
ian. The matter is entirely in my hands."
"What does your father think of Rus
sell's escapade?" was asked of the older
brother.
Herbert Lowry said yesterday that he
wanted it understood that he was not
"hostile" toward his younger brother and
thai he did not want to punish him un
necessarily.
"If he'll come home I'll treat him all
right," said Herbert, "and so will the
rest of the folks, but he shan't live with
that George woman. If any one wants
to know anything about her character all
they have to do Is to ask the police."
"Singer? Naw, she can't sing," said Mr.
Martini in speaking of the voluptuous
blonde whom Herbert G. Lowry says shall
not have possession of his minor brother.
"She was valuable on the stage only be
cause of â you knowâ the way she was
built. She had a contract with me and
some one who she said was her manager
told her to quit me because she could do
better elsewhere. That was five weeks
ago and she hasn't worked since. She'll
not work in this town again."
According to Proprietor Martini of the
Oberon, Miss Annette Lucky George, or,
as she now Btylea herself. Mis. Russell R.
Lowry, will never again grace the stage
of a San Francisco music hall. She vio
lated her solemn contract with him, Mr.
Martini declares, and in consequence her
voluminous figure will no more loom In
the local beery musical swfrl.
The big brother of Russell Lowry,
evidently believing that* he cannot save
the latter from the loving advances
of his blonde inamorata by haying
him jailed on a charge of perjury, is go-
Ing to try a new scheme to-day. This
time his shafts will, be leveled at the fair
concert hall singer. Herbert Lowry pro
poses to consult to-<lay with the District
Attorneys of Alameua and San Francisco
counties and try to have a warrant is
sued for the blonde charmer's arrest on a
charge of abducting the younger scion of
the house of .Lowry. An alleged wife be
ing arrested on a charge of carrying off
by force the man wno procured a license
to marry her is not without an element of
humor.
No Trace of the Boy Russell Has
Been Discovered, and No Evi
dence of a Wedding Can
