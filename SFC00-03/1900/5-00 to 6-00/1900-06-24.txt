Continued on Paara Twa.
The night was Just falling when the Ion*
scout, clad in an Indian blanket and look
ing Sioux, reached the trails lately made
by the soldiers. The darkness came on
rapidly and the rain fell upon the trails,
so that by the time the scout had come to
the point of the separation of the divisions
the greatest skill of "this man of the plains Â¦
was for a time baflled. In the darkness
all was incongruity; in the. several trails
where the man looked for but one. trail.
For a time this seemed like a battlefield
itself. The sharp - eyes of the trained .
frontiersman, assisted by the keener eyes
of the little mare, enabled Groua^d
to follow the trail : down <Â« to , the
river, where for some reason the
command had failed to make a
section tinder Custer, but differing wlÂ«Â»
him In the plan row under headway he
had pone to his po3t with Crook, near
Sheridan. Just at this time Crook was
on the higher foothills of the Big Horn
Mountains with some of hia men, engaged
In a hunting tour. Grouard was gulda
for this party, and by cnance had his at
tention drawn far across the lowlying hills
toward the Rosebud, where he saw. as he
said, some strange signal fires. The offi
cers of the party scanned the country
with their glasses, only to laush at the
idea of this half native scout beinjj able
to read a message In the smoke of a few
lires some fifty miles away. Grouard was
positive, and said that Custer's division
was even now In conflict with the Indiana
who were outnumbering him and contend
ing with victory on their side.
* Still the scout was not believed, and to
prove the truth of this story of the slgmal
fires Grouard set forth in the afternoon
upon his trusty black mare for the place he
expected to find strewn with soldier dead.
Thlssoxt of maneuvering was
Indicative of serious trouble on the part
of him .who was Issuing., the commanas,

and a refusal to advance on the part of

savage knife had cut away the coveted

of one pack mule,, loaded with ammuni

largely upon fiction and imagination. Dr.
Ftewart has been able- to secure from the
cr.ly man who could have known the
truth of this occurrence the following 1
graphic account By way of introduction
It would be well to state, that Frank Â¦
Grouard, who waÂ» for years the chief of
pcouts of the United States army, was
the man who has torn aside the veil cf
mystery from this much-mlxed-up scene.
Grouard Is much of an Indian. Indian
he is in appearance, by reason of Kanaka
blood; Indian he Is by -manner, by means
cf having spent eome twenty-flve years
among the Sioux as their captive. He
rpeaks the language of the Sioux with
fluency, and understands them so well
that he can procure from them their most
closely gruarded secrets notwithstanding'
their great hatred of him as a scout for
the armies of their enemies. Knowing
them bo "well, Grouard wenflo the lead â¢

from them the true story by Insisting- in

THE DEATH OF GEN. CUSTER
SUNDAY CALLThis story, which has been told with
much regret, has been fully corroborated
by Rain-in-the-Face and others. It la also
One by one fell the few remaining men
of the gallant troop until but a few were
left. How strange that In that holocaust
of death this one gallant man should not
be hit by the flying bolts of death. One
by one the3e few fell, and still the leader
stood untouched by cruel bullet. Finally,
beside the great and gallant general ht3
brother, Tom Custer, fell In mortal agony.
Oh. what a picttire! There alone on that
hilltop, witK all human aid so far away;
with no friendly eye to pity, stood the
fair-haired and gallant Custer in the midst
of his dead followers. The bright sun of
that northern heaven smiled sweetly o'er
those desert fields, while the mad. howl
ing, devilish throng rose like a great lo
cust host from every draw and every
brush u.'tll thousands of warriors rent the
heavens with their cheers. They would
rush upon their foe and bear him away in
triumph to deck their savage show. The
circle narrows; escape fiees away, and th9
bravest cf the brave must yfpld. to awful

hands clutch toward the victim- he flees
their embrace. Death was inevitable, life

were men toward whom their hatred
burned so fiercely that nothing short of
barbaric torture could be thought of as
a fit accompaniment for them in death.
So General Custer was saved, as was
Captain Fetterman at Massacre Hill, by
direct order, for the pangs of torment.
On this last detour a
strange thing was noted
by the Indian assailants.
A large black horse rid
den by an officer became
unmanageable, and rush
ing headlong with his
rider sped with light
ning speed right through
the ranks of the
enemy. Many shots fol

ened animal until he was
far beyond the ranks of
the red men, when, to
their utter astonishment,
there was a puff of
emojte, and the man fell
to the east and north by
the rapidly Increasing
enemy. Realizing now
for the first time how
futile it was to stand
against such overwhelm
ing odds, the brave gen
eral led his men toward
the higher ridge in hopes
that he might retreat
across Its brow. Again

there were two black valets instead of
one grinning in the doorway. Should
things not become more prosperous in the
near future I anticipate that the whole
force will be on exhibition to assure
Americans of the establishment's abound

One of the most popular side-shows at
the Exposition is the Palais du Costume,
designed, by Felix, the .great dressmaker.
Beginning with the wild Gaulish women at
the time of the Roman invasion, he Iead3

lieve me, no one can escape It. There is
no cleverness, no accomplishment that
can atone in Paris for an old-fashioned
gown. Every afternoon a band plays at
the Palais du Costume and it Is rendered
very attractive. In the 1900 part of it real
women promenade marvelously arrayed,
but in the other departments the figures
are of wax. I cannot say that It differs
greatly from an elaborate waxworks
show. Mary Antoinette and her friends

to the evolution of the corset. This latter
is more interesting than it would seem, as
the corset varies In shape quite as often
as the gentleman's top hat. V.~o do not
realize that the fashion in figures is ao
capricious, but this exhibition shows that

In closing It will not be amiss to quote
the following words uttered by Hon.
Frank Mandril at the dedication of this
historic field as a national cemetery.

a bullethole in the forehead: and nothing
could be plainer than that Custer took his

sell their lives as dearly as possible while

brow of the hill, fell the last man of
those brave meA whom fortune had so
cruelly forsaken, and that man was the
fair-haired Idol of his regiment and the
much-hated enemy of the Sioux nation.
The greatest question of all has ever
been In regard to the death of Custer
himself. Several theories have been ad
vanced, but neither reason nor barbaric
custom have given them the warrant of
truth. Some have said that Rain-in-the-
Face shot Custer himself, as he was the
one in command on the field, as Sitting
Bull remained In camp until the battle
was over. Again it has been held that
â¢ General Custer was the last to die be
cause, he was held in reverence by the
savages as a sort of worthy foeman. It
i3 a fact that Custer was the last to
fall, but let us not look for the reason
for this fact outside of savage hatred,
which alone was the dominating factor
of the hour. Custer had long been a
marked man in the eyes of the Sioux
warriors, and while they might sate their
thirst for revenge on the ordinary sol

his scalp and mutilating his body, there

This struck me as a suggestix-e theme,
the more so as I fancied that' Hall
Calne's book would be a story of the fu
ture age, at least in part, and I remem
bered that common rumor in literary cir
cles here had thrown out the idea that
his book was to have as a part of its
motive. the conception of a kind of Leo
XIV, who was to be the rallying point; of
what the author thought the great so
cial and religious revolution of the twen
tieth century. On this point Hajl Calne
would express no opinion, but I shall
not be surprised if this conception forms
the most salient feature of his novel.
The notes which he has taken In Rome
by way of preparation for the novel fill
some hundred pages of notebooks, and I
am, by kind favor of the author, enabled
to print one of these characteristic pages
which contains a simple human transcript
reminiscent of Dickens. It is as follows:
A NIGHT, IN ROME.
It. was a night in February. The air
was dank and chill. I. was invited to a
reception at one of the old Roman houses
in the neighborhood of the Capitol, and I
walked to it by way of the Corso. The
'streets were dark and ' desolate. On a
doorstep near the Condotti a Woman sat
selling newspapers. Two little children 1
were with her. One of them lay asleep
in her arms; the other played by her
side. At the corner of the street going
up to S. Silvestro a boy of 6 or 7 was Bell-
Ing matches. His little face was very
pale and he coughed frequently in the
damp air. Going by the end of the Via
Condotti, I saw that a number of persons
were Btandlng \outslde the office of the
Tribuna. They. were the sellers of Jour
nals in the streets and were waiting for
their papers. I went up to look at them.
There were men, women and boys and
As the title suggests, the book is not
intended to present the history of the
times, except in so" much aa it directly
bears upon the domestic life of the char
acters involved.; It is rather a work with
a moral "to instruct some future reader
how much a transient vanity and will
fulness may wreck, and how much a
steadfast love and courage may retrieve "
Nevertheless, the history of the revolu
tionary-period is well brought out and
presented in such an acceptable manner
as to be equally pleasing and instructive

Going back by the Corso I came again
on my little matchseller. He was propped
up in a recess of a doorway, leaning his
head on the plinth of a great pilaster. His
eyes were closed, his pretty delicate face
was very pale and his tray of matches
was almost slipping out of his fingers. He
was fast asleep.
Oh, the cry of the children! the cry of
the children! the little helpless, innocent
victims of the social maelstrom! All the

The poor souls had their arms full.
Why didn't I carry the little boy myself?
Heaven knows I wanted to, but I did not.
I appeased my conscience for the moment
by givtng a trifle to buy milk for the little
fellow and then turned away. As I went
oft I heard all the way down the silent
street the same low, weary, sickly, hun
gry cry of the child. God knows how far
they had still to go.

and beautiful organization grew up under
the magic of its touch and thrived under
the warmth of its breath. The parish had
its clubs for men and boys, for social work
and ascetic work, for money lending and
monthly communions. These parish or
ganizations were unified in a district or
ganism. Each district organism was com
pact in that of a diocese; every diocese
wa3 in. communication with Rome, and in
the very hands of the Holy Father ended
the lines of direction. If. as a friendly
critic -has observed, the church of Rome
had wished a plot it possessed a splendid
machine.
"Discontent chafed the land. The Ital
ian Government was reasonably and un
reasonably blamed simply because it was
the Government and because generations
of autocratic rule had accustomed the
people to throw the responsibility for
everything on the existing Government.
The passive attitude of the people' had not
changed in a few decades of constitu
tional government.
"The farmer and the laboring man, even
when they had understood the principles
of representative government, had had
to delegate some one else to represent
them in the National Parliament. Land
lords and lawyers crowded the legislative
halls, and their interests could not have
been absolutely identical with those of
the people whom they represented. Hence
occurred the inevitable errors of repre
sentative government acting In a country
which was new to It. Disasterâ I Fay it
not to blameâ followed disaster during
thirty years. There w,ere also some of
those corruptions which are' worse than
errors ar.d disasters. The climax of this
extremely complicated and critical con
dition came in 1898. There were general
uprisings, and the new order, shaken to
its very foundations, passed through the
crisis only on account of the promptness
and energy of the repression.
"Now the same, conditions of unrest
were verified Jn the case of the clerical
party as In those of the other parties.- A
few men like Don Albertario put In words
this unrest as felt by clericals, and nat
urally concluded that the return of the
Pope would better things. It is not
known if, or how far, there was any com
plicity between local clerical organiza
tions and other antl-dynastlc organiza
tions. The challenges for proof made by
the Catholic press have never- been an
swered."
Here Mr. Hall Caine uttered a vibrant
protest against the use made of the name
Socialist. "It Is most Infamous," he said,
"that that name should be used by writ
ers, journalists and public speakers of
those who work for social amelioration.
I deny that there is any necessary con
nection between community of property
and anarchy as the means to obtain it."
Then he continued: , "The Catholic or
ganizations had been thriving side by

The latter were numerous. . You can hard
ly imagine how many periodicals these
printed. There were hundreds throughout
Italy. The revolution broke out as sores
do on a human body; first one uprising,
then another, or two or three at a time.
There was no natural connection between
one and another outbreak, only identity
in cause. Then, as ever, the torch waa

to his information.
I have made notes of the most import
ant part of this information communi
cated to me in an interview, and I give
them without binding myself too severely
in the matter of exactness of expression
in every case.
One of the first points touched upon was
the inevitable race question. To my in
quiry as to v.-hat. in his view, were the
f-aiient characteristics of the Latin race.
he answered that race differences were
merely surface differences. For instance,
he said. 1 have had six months of domes
ticities in this Roman household; six
months of insight and contact with tne
preat family which peoples Italy and cen
ters in Rome, and I. find that race ex-
I>reEsc* itself only on the surface, be the
race Anglo-Saxon or Slav, or Teutonic or
Latin. One and the same blood courses
from the heart, throbs in the brain ami
Xmlsep in emotion and life. I have found
men In Rome diversified in nothing sub
stantial from men in Poland and the Isle
cf Man. the United States and England.
But wherv* there is diversity, even inci
dental diversity, there is interest, and the
interest of this kind to be found in Rome
is vÂ« ry strong. First and paramount
among the diversifying influences is the
religion which has its capital and mother
church in Rome. Have >ou not some
times walked from slumbers in travel and
reco.cr.izcd at a glance soi:\e fabled and
stoned city, of which you had always be
fore read am dreamed, but which you had
never st-en?
Even so". Rome could be recognized as
the center of the great Catholic religion
by one from another planet, were he to
land In the Eternal City. He would un
derstand after a glance at its moral char
acter that this was the Rome of spiritual
domination. Religion is the chief factor
nt the differences which distinguish the
Roman from the Russian, the Laplander,
the Hindu and the Japanese. It perme
ates the life of the people by its dogma.
Its morality, its hgend, its poetry, its rit
ual, its saint !ore. It colors all the lives
of the Romans. This has been one of my
pleasures: to observe its influence in the
life of the Romans, especially of the low
er orders.

differences of race and nationality.
Where I find a wide difference is In the
attitude of the people toward the law.
I am at one with Mgr. O'Conneil in his
essay on the essential Christianity of our
law and of tho law of America, and on the
paganism of the old legislations.
Christianity had profoundly modified and
Fubt-taritially idterod the legislation of the
world before the time when the Declara
tion of Independence was drawn up. 1
find that the law here rests far too much
on the old pagan basis. It is the expres
sion not of the conscicr.ee of the people,
but of the ruler cf the people.
"As to military law. I find it is much
the same here as in England or America,
except for this difference. The procedure
Is identical. I ha\-c followed with the
closest attention tho action of the mili
tary tribunals and Rtuaied the files of the

were not overrated. They we.re general.
They indicated a condition of unrest in
many class-es of society. To me they

which they threw on the heart as well a.s
on tho working of Italian life, and be
cause they may occur again. Not only
the so-called socialists and anarchists
were discontented, but also the Catholic
party. This last was a vast organization,
purely religions in character and intended
for the sen-ice of religion in economic and
ether Eoheres of work. â¢ Â»
"Let me illustrate its origination and
development by an eld etory. Some pheas
ants Ii\-ed peacefully in a cornfield until
one day Farmer Brown noticed that the
corn was rich and ripe and would spoil if
left uncut. But there was so much of it!
He resolved to call his neighbors to his
aid. The young pheasants had heard him
telling his sor.s of his intention, and they
Informed their mother In alarm on their
return home. But nothing came of It. for
the neighbors' would not stir. Again
Farmer Brown looked at the field, and as
his neighbors had proved laggards he de
termined to get his cousins to help. The
birds, hearing him decide thus with his i
Fons. took fresh alarm; but again, when
the mother bird returned they were
calmed by her explanations that the i
cousins would probably never give a help
tug hand. But Farmer Brows came a
third time and saw that the corn must
either be quickly cut or left to rot. and ho
said to his sons: 'We will do the work
ourselves. We will all get up at 5 o'clock
to-morrow morning, and with a good will
we shall have done the work before the
day is out.* This time the mother bird
shared the alarm of her brood. They
would do the work themselves. They
would get up at 5 o'clock to-morrow
morning. They were evidently in earnest!
And she gathered her young and left the
field.
"So it was with the*Holy See aftrr 1870.
When it saw the temporal power torn
from it. it thought at first that a concert
of its neighbors and friends, the great na
tior.s. would be formed for effecting a res
titution, but this did r.ot come to pass.
Then it thought that its cousins, the Ger
mans, the Catholic powers â France. Aus
tria and Spainâ would intervene, but they
did not. Therefore, in hault honneur et
courage it pet about the regeneration cf
Italy. It resolved to take every legiti

HALL CAINE
"The chief element of legislation has
been a public safety bill,' on the face of
which Is written the suppression of the
socialist and anarchical organizations.
But the clerical associations stand on a
parity with these, and it looks remarka
bly likely that the measure was aimed
at clericalism expressing itself in Italy.
It would not have been in accordance
with common sense to have declared war
on the Vatican. If the outside world got
the idea that a religious war was being
waged Italy would be as Russia was
when it committed its most unpopular act
through endless yearsâ the enforcing of
the measures against the Jews. I went
to Russia at that time as a sort of In

essentially an economic persecution,
though religion Inevitably entered into it.
"And what was to be done, the revolu

out of favor. Baron Sonnino was clearly
indicated as his successor. He had an in
terview with the King. What passed be

it is clear from preceding and succeeding
events that he -made a renunciation in
favor of the Introduction of a quasi-mili

ends. This plan broke down before it
was brought to bear. The socialists
found that the clericals were not as
strong as they had imagined. The cleri
cals, found that the socialists had fallen
into general disrepute abroad owing to
the violence of their methodsâ methods
which of course the Vatican could not
countenance. Now there is an absolute
stand apart, a healthy and entirely proper
condition.
"How the public safety bill passed you
know. It was got through by violent leg
islative methods, royal decrees, suspen
sions of Parliament and extraordinary
procedure generally. This proposal was
the test question whether representative
government should endure undeflled in
Italy, whether the attitude of the people
should be merely passive, of criticism
only and not of representation, and
whether the government should be repre
sentative of the people or not.

its passing. He stood with the existing

Christian one, rather that for the preser

than for the preservation of free institu
tions. Of his political strength and per
sonal courage there can be but one esti
mate. By his legion of faithful deputies
he secured the triumph of the Cabinet
In the House. It was rumori'd at the time
of the most violent obstructionist debates
a few weeks ago that som.' of the pas

simple, elementary passions, the love o
men and women, hatred, revenge, * pity
and so forth. Can you not fancy the play
of these In the circumstances which I
have described?"
The mention of the conflict between the
two powers in Rome led Mr. Hall Calne to
say: "In any estimate of the forces of
conflict between the Vatican and the Qul
rinal in Rome, certain things must never
be lost sight of.. The first of these i3 that
United Italy is a very young country, that
in only thirty years of its life it has had
to do the work of centuries to put Itself
abreast of other nations and to attain
this in the presence of a constant adver
sary at home, the Vatican having.with
held itself from all participation in the
' national 'life. The next thing to be re
membered is that this adversary within
its own gates has the experience of many
centuries, with all the strings of power
which still remain in its hands, although
it is a fallen sovereignty. In the light of
these facts (for one would say that on its
own lines) Italy has done a very great
deal."
"Then I gather that you do not share
the prevailing opinion of the nations that
the Latin race is decaying?" 7
"How can I regard that as anything
but an exaggerated statement or a blun
der in the face of the work that Italy
has done since 1S70, and with the mem
ory of men like Mazzini. Garibaldi, Ca
vour and Crispiâ to mention In one group
not a few with whom I have but little
personal sympathy. Say that it is the
spirit of the Eternal City which gives this
perennial youth to the Latin race. The
fact remains that such extraordinary
things have been done and are being done
as are almost sufficient to justify the Uto

David Lazzaretti.-who dreamed the dream
of a world republic that was to have a

opened and they rushed in. snatched at
the supplies that were handed to them
and fled back, into the streets. In a cou

were flying down into the Corso, crying
"Tribunal" and fighting for the first
sales. Within half an hour they would
be all over Rome, sweating, panting, still
running and shouting. I buttoned up the
collar of my overcoat. In that chill air It
made me shiver to think of the price they
'paid for their bread.
It was a beautiful reception. Inside the
dark stone walls of the prisonlike palace
of old Rome, with its barred windows and
guarded portal, there was warmth and
color. Beautiful 'women in lovely gowns
and men in magnificent decorations. The
brilliant apartments, the more brilliant
company, the troops of liveried servants,
the bright music, the bright talk. I
stayed late, and returned, as I had come,
on foot.
The narrow silent streets without seem
ed very dark after the blaze of many
lights within. I was picking my way In
the darkness when I heard the low. tired,
hungry cry of a child. It was a boy, ap
parently of four years, who at midnight
was dragging his weary little feet home
by the hand of his father. The man was
evidently a seller of newspapers. Two
or three unsold Trihunas. carefully folded,
were protruding from the side pocket of

thfv sot too avariciouj. kcame d!shom-s=t
and lirousht about the downfall of a pro
fession that one need not be ashamed of
as it was once conducted. Whew! What
elegant fellows and what ppendthrlfts thÂ«
Mjfcfcissippi River gamblers were when I
came on the Majre of operations. A hun
dred dollars didn't bother them any more
than a cigar would one of us now. And â¢
clothes! They were -jII dressers. They
wore *oft black hats, black clothes, high- i
heeled boots, low-necked ehirts with big '
loose collars, and ties v.ith frilled bosoms.
Each had a solitaire breastpin and a big <
6olltaire rlnp. and one of those, big long i
cold chains poinc afcout the neck three or I
four times and hanging: down over the .
chest. They didn't drink anything but <
wine, and they would ride across the <

starbaclcs. I've seen fellows pick every
card in a pack and call it without miss-
Ing oncp. I've seen them shuffle one for
one all through from top to bottom, so
that they were in the same position after
.j. dosen shuttles that they were in at tirst.
They'd Just nutter them up like a flight
of <|uaiJs and get hcÂ£s. kings, queens,
Jacks ::nd tons all together as easy as pie.
A tucker had no more chance against
thi.se fellows than a snowball has in a
red-hot oven. Every deck was marked.
It dots not Keem possible now that such
simple sames were not exposed.
"The most adroit schemer in those days
was an Alabama man named James W.
Stricter. He was the originator of many
<â¢nnlidcr.ee schemes that have been worked
thr^-adbcre. He was the most ingenious
â¢swindler I ever came across. An anecdote
of how he worked his game will illustrate
how, abundant money used to be in those
days and how easily the.m^n on the Mis
sissippi River steamers used to part with
it. He got hold of a rich Superior Court
Judge from Cairo, 111., one day. The Judge
didn't happen to have a wad along that
day, and he quickly caught on to Street
pr'a game. The Judge went secretly to the
bartender of the boat and got a bundle of
a boat, all supposedly strangers to eacn
other, and playing into each other's
hands. Sometimes there would be a kick,
and the captain would get hot. When a
passenger would squeal the captain would
ask him to pick out the man who robbed
him. and the gambler, if nabbed, would
haveÂ»to give up the stuff and get off the
boat anywhere the captain chose to run
her in. The tricky gamblers used to
have false whiskers and wigs for these
occasions, so that when the kick was
made they couldn"t be picked out under
their disguises. Many a time I've known
them to jump off the boat into the water
before the boat landed to get away before
the kick was made and the victim could
look at the passengers to pick out his
man. There wasn't much prosecuting
then if a fellow was caught. The captain
was boss, and he made the man give ud
put him off the boat, and that settled it
They didn't Jug a man right away
"Were there any shadows to the eay
times on the Mississippi River steamers?
Yes. occasionally. The saddest event was
one that happened in the fall of 1S5S At
that time John Powell was the most fam
ous sport. He wa3 a square man. hand
some, brave jind not showy. He despised
the tricks. of the tin-horn gentry I have
been telling you about. He had known
Andrew Jackson personally and had de
clined a nomination to Congress from a

silence. The opener on my left drew two
cards. I started to draw one. but whllo
I bit my lips and tried to be calm I Crew
three. The dealer dealt himself one card
and then slowly dealt himself another.
"The air grew thick and heavy. I felt:
In a dizzy whirl. I knew'the moment was
to be a memorable one in my life. 1 never
sca'nned my cards so anxiously as I dldT
that night. I instinctively knew mytwai

artfully. Then I just called. The dealer
saw the opener's JUJOO and raised it toÂ»

were so excited at each other's playing
that they had for a motnent forgotten all
about me. I sat between them, you know.
They were just coins to show up their
hands, when I exclaimed: 'Here.J'm play

He lost a couple of times just to flash his

the game, but the Judge wouldn"t have it.
and Jim kicked. He went ashore and tolil
a friend about a fellow who had done him.
and Just as he was telling it the Judge
came to the rail and Jim pointed him out
to his friend.
" 'Why, you sucker,' said the friend,
'that's so-and-so from Cairo. He knows
every gambler on the river.'
"Jim offered the Judge a 5300 suit of
clothes not to tell the story, but the Judge
wouldn't hear of it, and all New Orleans
heard the story when the Judge got off the
boat.
"Jack Gambill used to tell a story of a
fellow named Dan, who was a most noto
rious cheat and couldn't play fair at any
game in the world. 'I saw Dan the other
day,' said Jack, 'and he was sitting down
to a table all alone and playing a game
of solitaire. And. do you know, he hadn't
sat there five minutes before he began
nudging the ; leg of the table to play In
with him.'
"Eph Horn, the pioneer minstrel, was
bo. Infatuated with gaming that he never
could go to bed so long as there was a
light burning over a green cloth. He- had
a boy named Henry Cahan, whom he sup
ported, and the boy was quite an expanse
to him. One day in the old Arcade Horn
sat with' a solitary white chip In his hand,
the last of his $S0 a week. He was hesi
tating whether to bet it or not, when up
came Henry and said:
" 'Hurry up, Eph, and make a winning,
bo we can go to dinner.'
" 'Me? lie make a winning with four
bits? You might as well talk of lowering
a fireproof safe out of a window with a
horsehair.'
"Star Davis was a great old boy. Jim
McLane's mother allowed him JW.00O a
year not to come near her. but he was
broke nearly all the time for all that, and
he had to gamble to make his way. Hank
Johnson was a daisy, a hard player, who
never wore a pair of boots worth less
than $20. Gib Cohern and Tom Mackey
were the dressers of the river. All their
winnings used to go Into clothes. They'd
send to Paris for their underclothing and
all that sort of thing. They were great
rivals in those days, when dress went for
something. Doc Hill was McLane's part
ner. . Then there was Big Alexander,
who worked out of Natchez: Jim McDon
ald, a dead shot with a pistol; Ashlock.
who could do more funny work with a
deck of cards than I ever saw before or
since. I couldn't name them all. They
were good fellows â free with their money
as water, after scheming to bust their
heads to get It.
"Why. it wasn't anything but gamble
after a boat left St. Louis until It reached
New Orleans. I've seen a faro game, a
roulette game, three poker gamea and
monte running in the cabin, and the deck
hands playing chuck-a-luck. I once saw a
planter, a relative of Jefferson Davis,
play roulette with five-dollar gold pieces
on the steamer Molly Brown. I have
known men to drop 51000 at faro before
one could smoke half a cigar. I once saw
two Louisville tobacco merchants bet $100
at a clatter upon quolt-throwing on deck.
I saw a man from Memphis lose his whole
cotton crop in one night and get up and
never mind it particularly. Poker waa
mostly the game. They played bluff and
brag a good deal, and there was generally
a big game on every boat. Many a time
I've seen a game player just take off his
watch and rings and studs and play them
in. Men lost their goods playing in the
way-bills. I've seeÂ» them betting a bale
of cotton at a crack, and It wasn t at all
uncommon to hear an old planter betting
off his negreos on a good hand. Every
man who ever ran on the river knows
that these old planters used to play in
their body servants, valuing them all the
way from $300 to $1500. I saw a little col
ored boy stand up at 5300 to back his
master's faith in a little flush that
wasn't any good on earth. The niggers
didn't seem to care particularly about it,
and It was so common that nobody no
ticed It particularly.

all took a fancy to him because he was
so well dressedâ Just out of a university*

young Englishman played together two
days and two nights, and although Powell
ptavpd a square game the* young man lose
all the money he had with him. He turned]
over his bank checks and drafts to Pow

to his stateroom and brought up his bag

that might have caused a duel, but you
can bet we kept casting sheep's eyes ove?
toward Powell and the young English
man as they played. It was late ona
evening when the two quit playing. be-Â»
cause Powell had wen all that tho young*
fellow had.
" 'Well. I'm about busted.* said tha<
young Englishman with a forced laugh 1
when he got up and walked â¢"â¢ on deck."
"Powell laughed, too. and began tai

"As for Powell, why. he was almost
crazy. He would sit for days at a tima'
doing nothing but smoke. He seemed tn;
be in a daze, and we could not rouse hlnv
to any enjoyment. He got some banker In'
New Orleans to send all that young Engr-!
lishman's stuff back to the old home lnij
England, and he was never known tar
speak of the affair afterward. The sol-:
cide hoodooed him bad. for when he trt*cj!

his big property In a few years. He lived; '

that we double the Jackpot we were en-'

estate of less than ST-OO. Even that was
cent a* a gift to him In his old age by a
circle of young gamblers in New Orleans.
Af a boy in the old St. Charles Hotel in
New Orleans he saw some of the greatest
Rambling games between rich planters.
United States Senators and Southern ora
tors that were ever played. Before he
was 20 he wa5 an adept at poker, and
btfere he was 23 he was rich and famous
by his remarkable fucccss as a faro
dealer.
In 1SST. at the ape of 72 years, he played
his last pane cf cards, and with the few
thousand dollars his devoted wife had sav
ed from his enormous winnings in other
days the old couple came to live in Cali
fornia, From that time he never touched
cards again. But he lived in the memory
of the old days when he sat about the
green table, and he was always glad to
chat reminiscer.tly of all the big games
he participated in. He had a remarkably
accurate memory for details. There can
be little doubt that he was the best
known faro dealer and round-table poker
player there was on the Mississippi River
Fteamers in the last years previous to the
Civil War. The late Attorney General
Garland ence Paid that the originator of
many of the fundamental principles of
draw poker as it is known to-day was
Major White. The old gambler was a fino
type of the old-fashioned gambler. He
was prodigal in his living, ready to bet
on any proposfUon. quite abstemious in
his habits, courteous to women, seldom
excited and nevi-r ashamed of his calling.
He often introduct* himself to strangers
as an "honest, gentlemanly gambler."
He was as famous for his reckless ex
travagance as for his unusual winnings In
his younger days. Whpn the First Louis
iana Regiment was formed in 1S61 to go
to the Civil War. Major White dined the
commissioned officers at the old St,
Charles Hotel in New Orleans at a cost
of $H r 0. He never quarreled and seldom
raised his voice. He was sensitive about
his meager schooling and his bad gram
mar: he was particularly well Informed,
on the other hand, on the history of his
country and affairs of the day. He knew
personally all the leading men of the day
who traveled to any degree forty years

He used to narrate anecdotes of games
of cards in which Henry* Clay and .he
were both participants In 1S4S and 2S43.
when White was beginning his career as
*a. gambler. He had a genius for faro, and
his winnings on many occasions exceeded
J2000 in one night. He was employed at
a salary of $3'W a week for several years
by a club in New Orleans Bimpiyto deal
faro every night in the week. At last,
when he srew weary of that, his salary
was raised to $400 a week. He made $30.
000 in 1KV7 by gambling on the Mississippi
Ttiver. and there were a number of years
when his winnings aggregated $12,000 and
$13,000 In twelve months. But he spent his
money with a reckless hand. He had a
crowd of friends constantly about him,
and he was always giving $50 and $100 to
less fortunate gamblers.
As he eat in his big easy chair one day,
& month before his death, he chatted a
long time about his memories of the
palmy days of gambling, and particularly
of the wonderful games he used to par
ticipate in on the palatial Mississippi
River steamers before the Civil War.
"The most wonderful gambling days this
country has ever known were from about

Poor fellows: But my. what big days
they used to have in the palmy days of
pteamboatlng on the Mississippi River!
Take it twenty-five years ago. when the
gaming began to fall- off. There never
will be days again like them in these
i nlted States. Ah. but those were the
days, my boyâ great days for the town,
with thirty-six steamboats at the wharf
all at once, the levee covered with drays
and every sport with stuff in his pockets
and lots of good clothes. . -v
"There were fully H00 men who worked
the boats between St. Louis and New
Orleans, and there's no telling how much
money they did pull off the travelers. It
was dead easy money, too." all the tim*\
Kvorybody who traveled had lots of stuff,
and every one was willing to bet and .bet
high, so that when a fellow did win he

Southern planters just used to lose money
like fun. and were skinned right and left.
Occasionally they caught on. and there
was a shooting match, but the boys didn't
take much chance on being plugged. I've
seen forty gamblers on one boat. . That
was in October. 1S57, when the officers at
Natchez cleaned all the gamblers out of
town. The whole gang met the boat at
the wharf and started to come aboard,
but the captain wouldn't let them unlesa
they promised not to play a card aboard.
They promised and he took them on and
the boat came on up the river. You
nover saw a tireder looking lot of gamb
lers in your life. They hadn't anythins'
to do and some of them looked as it
they'd Just as soon Jump overboard aa

"Of course, that class of gamblers had
to do something to take chances on. and
the passengers with money were Jus<t aa
anxious to have some sport Invented for
them. The gamblers had promised not
to touch cards on the boat, so necessity
gave us the incentive to invent new
Fthemes for helping the passengers from
a plethora of gold and silver. Dead-sure
games thereby came about. For instance,
when we landed at a woodpile and while
the deckhands were loading the boat up
with fuel, the gamblers would get the
moneyed passengers off bn the bank to
pnirage in various skin games. The gamb
lers artfully got to betting among them
selves about running jumps, and. of
r-ourse. the passengers dropped into 'it.
So they'd run off a gangplank and up to
a tree to Jump, when the first gambler
would say. 'Hello, what's here?' and
stop. Behind the tree 1 one of the gang
had be*n throwing three-card monte.

boat up or down and worked their way
up this way or down to New Orleans.
"That wasn't gambling; it was robbery,
but that's what went as gamblins in
those times. The fellows had to be pretty
slick. I'll tell you. When a boat started
out of New Orleans, say. a couple of
gamblers would be on board. They v/ere
often well educated fellows and always
fine dressrrs. All they did was just get
acquainted with the men with money and
size up how much they had. This was
easily done, because card playing was the
only thing to pass away*ihe time. These
cappers wouldn't win any money. They
were Just to do the gentlemen, but when
they got off the boat their pals came at
some pcint up the river with a full knowl

men were best approached. It wasn't
hard to get acquainted, and it wasn't
hard to get up a game of euchre after a

THE SUXDAT CALL.
5When the fever and delirium left her,
probably for lack of aliment in her wasted
organism, she saw that it was morning,
almost at daybreak. The reality of things
again appealed to her eyes.' She saw
green walls, the barred window frames,
the calico blinds, the beds, the two fire
places. The weather again was fine. She
looked at the bed next to her own. It
was empty.
"May!" she murmured.
She raised her head a little from the
pillow and called again, more loudly:
"May Bodson!"
A voice replied from the other side of
the bed:
"May is no longer here. Christ has re
called her to Him."
Lea was not strong enough to turn and
look at the person who had spoken, but a
light step made the circuit of the bed, and
Lea saw a figure and face stoop over her.
It was a nurse in the white cap and apron.
She held a little black book in her left
hand.
"How do you feel?" she said.
And then only did Lea recognize her.
"Edith!" .
tion that was almost cweet and voluptu
ous. The beloved vision had reappeared
of the picture of that dream .country in
which . she would find Georg again amid
the glory of a radiant summer. Lea could
see the blue bay belted with odorous hills,
and at the same time she felt an unaccus
tomed warmth like an intangible presence
which reassured her, the contact of fra
ternal hands touching her more caressing
ly than the hands of the nurses.
The fear of death haunted her, in
creased, Became intense, and at the same
time the religious sentiments that had
slumbered in semi-indifference since in
fancy awoke. Lea asked for a Catholic
priest, and one was broughtâ an Irishman
from Killarney. with a roey, reposeful
countenance, framed In fair hair care
fully trimmed; light blue eyes, fine strong
teeth, with an ample frock coat and
etraight hands. He came and sat by the
invalid's bedside, placed his voluminous
and carefully brushed silk hat on the
night table and talked to her. Father
Patrick Weatherdon spoke well, with
unction and fluency.
At first Lea was relieved by his visit.
Then, when, little by little he had divined
"Ah! Why did not my brother live?
How happy we should have been to
gether! It is the relentless doctrines of
Frederique and Plrnlte that have turned
me out of the right path, that have torn
me from normal life and love. They took
me from Georg! They are the cause of my
death!"
Toward the end of August the weather
changed and became rainy. The | fires
were lit In the two fireplaces of the con-
Bumptive ward, but stealthy -draughts
penetrated through the Joints of the
doors and in" the window openings. The
low lying London sky filled the air with
smoke. Tho patients were more nervous,
some of the cases became worse and two
deaths occurred. Many fell fatally 111.
Her little yellow eyes in her wrinkled
face smiled at Lea, telling' her of the
hope always nearer of an approaching de
liverance. And Lea also felt this terror
of autumn pass over her face, the ter.
riblc provider, of food for consumption.
She took almost no food and was now
given up by Dr. Ainsworth, who barely
stopped a moment by her bed. Just long
enough to note the diminution of vitality
he had predicted, and no longer tried to
convert her to a belief in overalimenta
tion. A slow despair began to invade thÂ«
poor solitary soul. And a sort of rancot
germinated In it against those whom shÂ«
accused of having driven her to that place
âagainst Frederique and Plrniti.
"She Is right. She may die now; It is
even better that she should! But I have
not had my five years of happiness with
my beloved. I will not die!"
fresh at that time as a little rosebud In
May. But I am only a little she-monkey
now! 'Little Tom' was right* But it's
all the same to me. They cannot take my
five years of happiness away from me."
Her energetic sincerity astonished Lea.
How well she understood this poor, bro
kendown, decrepit girl, dying at twenty
two years of. age! How well she under
stood that life concentrated in live years
of love and that came to an uncomplain
ing end when tho five years were over!
She almost envied the "little Bhe-mon
key." and thought:

open her eyes to escape from such terri
fying dreams. She examined the objects
eround her. Th<? lamps, shaced and low
ered for the night, gave out a yellowish
lifrht, in which the outline of everything
,eeemed uncertain and changing. Some of
the beds were as still as the tomb, the
slumbering body curiously carving the
coverlet into a sort of sculpture. But how
much suffering contended with the un
real repose of night in a hospital in that
vast ward!

And for the first time she looked the
possibility of her own death in the face:

the vacancy of her mind with the curious

to hear it the better. Or lying with closed

closed eyelids. And Lea would try to

ject. Then from the bottom of hr-r soul
a violent shudder protected apalnst the
eound ar.d the aspect of the terrible word.
a port of mental spasm made her seek to
rirtve it away. Fhe could not sincerely
ray: "I am gninp to die." In the same
ward were a score of other beds placed
perpendicularly to the pale green walls
âtwo between each of the Eliding win
cows. Fhaded by calico blinds.
Usually only about throe or four of
these beds were empty; the others, neatly
tucked in. f.-ith their little light wood'
right tab!* Inside them, contained other
helpless women, almost all still young
women who eonstwd. who ppat blood, who
complained. like Lea. of pains in their
poor backs, of bleeding lacerations in
their throats. As far as regarded these
Â¦women, the word death had a precise
eignincance for Loa. She could imagine
them ceaslr.p to move-, their breathing
fctopped. And it was not *\-pn a mys
tery; it was simply a light blown out
that was all. But for hersr-!f, to cease to
be conscious, to cease to add links to the
uninterrupted chain of her thoughts to
no longer feel the reaction of things and.
nevertheless, to rrmain lying there in that
uarne little bedâ no. she could not Im
agine it. No effort of her mind could
conceive It! â¢
*7v? T the workshop one morning Lea
jl \\ felt as though she were suffocating;

put her handkerchief to her mouth.

She was not alarmed beyond measure.

L.y:ng there, pale as a waxen virgin, rack

thought: ""What a fortunate thing it is

Her cainjiiets surprised thoee around
her. for they all. from tneir own observa
tion and irom the doctor's remarks, knew
how seriously ill she was. Mrs. Cocking
ton was in despair. The Smith family be
came suddenly pitiless ana tfaretittned to
leave the house if the young giri was not

"But where can ehe go. Mr. Smith?"
objected Mrs. Cockingron. "The poor
child is completely friesidiess In London."
"Let her return to France, then, to her
family; or let her go to the hospital!
Where could she be oetter nursed than in

Mrs. Cockington succeeded in persuading
her boarders to have patience lor a litue
time, tstill, she felt herself becoming less
pitiful as the list cf exj.-enses caused by
the girl's illness increased, for Lea had
earned nothing for a long time. The step

Faint whispers would pass from bed to
bed between neighbors. Sometimes a ter
rible voice, altered by sleep, would clamor
a eudden. terrified appeal: or a conscious
moan, a "Help, please! Help!" would dis
turb the restless slumber of the invalids,
and she would see the nurse on duty leave
the armchair in which she was slumber
ing and glide quickly, a light phantom in
white headdress and apron, toward the
patler.t who had cried for her heip. And
in the oppressive silence the clock in the
Westminster tower would ring out the
Ironical notes of its chimes.
Then the dawn would show Itself, wan
and uneven toward the windows. The
lamps seemed merely to illuminate that
part of the ceiling where they were hang
ing. The early daylight of August would
enter through all the openings, invading
the closed room, and all nocturnal terrors
would vanish and a beneficent freshness
descend upon those feverish foreheads.
Lea would fall into a profound slumber
that would have been delicious and
strength-restoring if. when she awoke to
wnrd 7 o'clock in the morning, she. had
not found herself bathed in an abundant
perspiration that transformed her night
dress and the sheets into damp rags. Then

consequent bad temper or indifference of
the nurses, and tho pain caused by the
slightest shock :o her shoulders and back,
even to her arms and lees, for she was

grating voice, due to tuberculosis of the
vocal cords. "But what of it? 1 don't

If it had not been for his wicked mother,
who had a rich match for him, he might
perhaps have married me. Yes, 1 believe
that after a glass or so too much he would
have been quite capable of going to

They left Salisbury at S o'clock by tho

the Bible, and Lea was burled lna thrill

Edith? Oh. that nothing may detain him

"Edith, look! The sea!"
Edith, smiling and quite Indifferent
about any scenery, cast a glance at the
horizon, which alternatively seemed to
grow wider and then diminish, ana im
mediately began to read again. A number
of little watering places now succeeded
each other along the railway. The mild
ness of the dying summer had prolonged
the life and pleasures of these modest sea
side resorts. Women, seated upon camp
stools, were working. Young couples
came and went, taking exercise on the
shore. Some little naked children were

duty, and demanded the address of her
relatives bo that he could write to them.
She became Irritated, took a dislike to
him, refused to Bee him, and. suddenly,
her fit of religious anxiety disappeared.
Besides, all the remnant of her strength
was dying away. She now suffered cru
elly at every attack of coughing. She
gradually lost the faith that had sus
tained her until then of meeting Georfc
again by the direct intervention of Prov
idence.
And the mirage of the dream country
that she Imagined to be the Italy so dear
to her beloved, the marvelous bay encir
cled by flower-bedecked terraces and ver
dant capes, no longer appeared to her,
although she tried to conjure up the pic
ture before her obstinately closed eyes.
And then she gave herself up. She let
herself slip along toward death, abandon
ed to herself, angry with destiny and with
the living. Long periods of prostration
plunged her in a state of complete uncon
sciousness. She recovered her senses
bathed In a cold sweat, and rather than
call the nurses to change her linen she
remained as she was, shivering between
the damp sheets. She let herself slip to
ward death, not with the smiling resigna
tion of May Bodson. tut with an indig
nant spirit, rebellious against the injus
tice of Fate, bitter with hatred for those
who had guided her infancy. The life of
abnegation and altruism that she had led
through Frederique and Romalne appear
ed to her now to have been a foolishly
wasted one. She would have liked to re
commence it, to undo the useless devo
tion that had consumed it. Oh! those pre
cious years'- Who could give them back
to her now? The fatal germ was In her.
in her bleeding bosom. After having
spent her youth and (sacrificed her heart
for the happiness of others, she was dy
ing, abandoned, upon a hospital bed.
Her condition became still worse. Sho
again began to vomit blood, which weak
ened her. Fever and hallucinations trans
ported her beyond the limits of reality
for several days. She was delirious and
no longer saw the vast ward with its
green walls, or the beds, or "Little Tom,
or the nurses.
Then this delirium, at first obscure, cha
otic and painful, little by little, settled
down into a sort of continuous intoxlca-

CHAPTER ?. â â
"Isn't It time to go In, Edith, and ret
ready tor leaving?"
"No, dear; the .train doesn't leave for
Torquay for two hours yet. Rest quietly.
We are very comfortable hero."
Sitting side by side upon a bench. In the
clear, translucent shade of one of the
tricentenary elms that beautify the In
comparable Cathedral Close, at Salisbury,
Edith, in her nurse's costume of blue
serge and white linen, and Lea, In a long
traveling cloak of fawn-colored cloth,
were talking quietly.
Their eyes were enchanted by the old
etone monument, surrounded with velvety
lawns and majestic trees and, as u border
to the square, the old gabled houses of
the Middle Ages; so old! so old! with their
peaked roofs and little diamond-shaped
window panes; so old! and yet young be
side the .venerable basilica!
Edith watched over her companion with
maternal solicitude. Lea was dear to her
when they used to meet every day In
Clariss & Sons' workshop. But since she
had, so to speak, torn her out of the grasp
of death she had felua concentrated, pas
slonato love for her which stirred her
usually calm soul to its depths. Death, in
fact, loosed its grip. Lea still appeared
thin and feeble, but it was the thinness
and feebleness of convalescence. Her
bright eyes lit up with hope, her red lips,
the rosy coloring of her cheeks, all testi
fied to the longing, the will, the power
to love.
Fifteen days had sufficed to bring about
this transformation. The day following
Edith's return to London after the death
of the young. woman whom she had been
nursing she received Lea's letter. She
had immediately gone to Mrs. Cocking
ton's and from there to the hospital in
Commercial road. As she had remained
Jr. correspondence with Tlnka, she knew
the Ortsens' address, something that had
-been ignored at Free College for the last
two months. They were all at Torquay,
In Devonshireâ Hoedel and his wife Tinka,
the two girls, Carola and Ida. and also
Georg, who was still inconsolable, worn
with anxiety, incurable in spite of the
time that had elapsed.
The magic of those words,- "I know
where they are: we will go to them," had
Slttlng upon the forms with which this
promenade was provided. Lea noticed a
number of wasted figures, some of them,
wrapped In shawls In spite of the heat.
Her heart throbbed painfully, for in their
attitude and faces she recognized the ter
rible malady of which she had believed
she was dying. Gcorg divined her
thoughts and tried to amuse her by show
ing her the pier that the landau passed
upon the right, crowded with people lis
tening to 'a German orchestra playing.
Georg kissed Lea's ungloved hands.
"This part of the southern coast la
more favored than any other spot In this
foggy Island. When you dreamed of It.
Lea, you dreamed of Italy, for even tho
bay of Naples is not more enchanting."
The carriage was now passing the rocks
that they had seen before them a few
moments ago. They could se the whole
of the western promontory, the lowest of
the two. from Cape Corbyn to Brixham.
The rocks which shut In the road at first
soon fell back upon the left, with a prom
enade constructed along part of tha
cliff s-
"You little foolish thing." said Edith
smiling, "you are not dreaming. Why
should you be astonished that we have
such magnificent scenery in England?
England is the most beautiful country In
the world!" *
"Yes, I have already seen this place In a
dream, with that sky and sea, those ter
races, that red earth, all these flowers
and the balmy air. But I thought I was
dreaming of Italy. Can It be possible
that I see all this and yet am still In
England? My thoughts are so confused
and lost. Georg, dear Georg. I .cannot
believe it Is a dream."
Lea's gaze took in all this expanse of
fclue sea and sky. the brightness of every
thing, the splendor of the day: sho
breathed In the Intoxicating, perfumed
air. heavy with the scent of plants and
flowers. She brushed the soft, strag
gling locks of hair from before her eyea
and murmured:
A hundred yards In advance the route
turned abruptly, barred bv two big hills
covered with verdure and disposed one
above the other, like terraces or like tho
seats of an amphitheatre. Between tho
two and a little in the rear was a lower
hill surmounted by the white steeple of a
church. The richness and abundance of
the vegetation were extraordinary, a lux
uriant vegetation of a truly southern pro
fusion. The hills were literally two gigan
tic heaps of verdure, in which the villas
appeared to be half buried, almost hidden,
for nothing could be percerved above tho
foliage except a few slate* roofs, turned
a metallic color by the sun. and the ar
rowlike glaring white stono steeple.
In front of these hills the bay extended
to the horizon In blue splendorâ the green
ish blue of a pale turquoiseâ an Immense
semicircle embraced between two lone
rocky capes, like the claws of a crab'
with Brixham at the end of the promon
tory on the right and Torquay at the end
of the promontory on the left. All that
could be perceived of the rocks between
the trees and plants was bright red In
colorâ the red of broken brick. The ver
dure subjugated the rocks as If under a
crushing load. Beyond the two promon
tories was the open sea. melting Into a
paler sky. All the bay was alive and
palpitating with movement and Joy un
der the glorious sunlight. Yachts rock
ed at their moorings, boats glided about
under the rhythmical cadence of their
oars, yawls bending under the breeze*
sped along over the surface of tho water
like marine birds. A little puffing steamer
was making the cross voyage between
Paignton and Torquay.
Until the moment that the landau turned
this bend in the road Lea had really seen
only Georg. She had perceived as a sort
of indistinct background the surrounding
scenery, the broad, white roadway, separ
ated from the sea by a rousrh stone para
pet, and bordered upon the left with well
kept lawns and English parka, with their
halls hidden amone the shrubbery. In her
delight at being with Georp asaln. a Georg
who resembled the one she loved for
merly, she glanced around and examined
the wooden he1srht3 and the surrounding *
landscape slowly.
"Oh!" she cried, "I have already seen" â
She did not finish her sentence, and con.
tlnued looking.
Lea cherished this air of weariness. It
was that of the Georg she preferred, tha
only one who could render to her the re
membered sweetness of tho kiss he had
given her at Richmond.
The road followed by the carriage skirt
ed the bay for more than a mile between
tho station and the town. At about half
the, distance it turned at rlt?ht angles
around a line of high hills, and thence
continued at the foot of this natural wall
toward Torquay.

End for a moment dreamed of bearing her
away from them? The uncertainty be
came almost torture to Lea. It appeared
to her that the moment when her doubt
would be dissipated retreated interminably
as though in a nightmare, and that never,
never more, womd Â»ha know him. would
she- see him.
And it was really an awakening start.
the arrival of Torquay, the stoppage or
tho train in the long, low-roofed station,
the hubbub and tumult of the departing
passengers, and the confused visionâ a taii
man dressed in dark gray, who rushed to
ward the door of the carriage, ana then,
the close embrace, and their names united
in a double cry.
Oh. the mystery of the first glance ex
changed by two beings who nave long
been separated and wnose minds during
the separation have been full of the ab
sent ene's image, the last onÂ© retained
upon the retina! In that first glance, and
in .that one alone, they compare the real-
Ity^with the rememDered portrait. It be
comes more material and visible under tho
features they now gaze upon. Then svd
denly, like the breath upon a mirror, the
mark of time evaporates and disappears.
the visage of yesterday and the one of to
day mingle imperceptibly, and the new
Imprint is lost in the old and deeper one.
Ihe open landau carrying Georg, Edith,
and Lea along the road leading from tho
station to the town by the seashore had
scarcely turned the bend of the bay be
fore this mysterious fusion of yesterday
and to-day had been consummated. Yet.
If Georg had seemed to Lea less enfeebled
than she had imagined from Tinka's novel
what a heart-breaking shock was his to
Bee Lea so changed! At the very moment
even when he embraced her. a brutal con
viction overpowered him: â "She is lost!"
A few minutes had passed, the carriage
was rolling along between the lawns
and the bay. and already Georg's eyes
could no longer distinguish between tho
old portrait and the new. And at tho
same time his piercing certitude became
feebler, combated by the deceitful sug
gestions of reflection, longing and invin
cible hope.
They did not speak. Their souls wero
too full of grave cares to seek an outlet
In Idle words. They regarded each other
with avidity, and peace settled gradually
In their hearts. Lea was sitting at tho
back of the landau beside Edith, whoso
kindly, comical faceâ two childlike eyes,
a big, straight cut mouth and a tiny nose
nestling between two pincushion cheeks â
glowed with kindly joy. Georg, sitting on
the front seat, stooped toward Lea, hold-
Ing her hands and devouring her with his
gaze. She. with her beautiful eyes, larger
and more ardent than ever, slowly cax
Â¦^ssed the face, the dress, tho entire persoa
9f Georg.
She examined, as though she had never
leen before, the natural curls of fair hair
clustering under the white straw hat with
Its black ribbon. The smallnesa of tho
head, remarkable for such a tall man. was
even accentuated by the long, slender
throat. His pale visage, of a pallor tinged
with warmth by the tan due to the sea
air, displayed a profile of a delicacy that
was almost feminine, particularly In tho
outline of the narrow forehead, the finÂ©
chin and the almost affected grace of tho
mouth. The deep set, green-gTay eyes and
the mustache, not so fair as the hair â
heavy and warlike, so to speakâ vlrilized
the extreme beauty of the head. Georg"
was dressed like an Englishman, in a
dark gray, woolly Jacket, but a large tie.
loosely knotted around the upright collar
with a rather negligent elegance, replaced
the narrow butterfly bow that was fash
ionable just then. With her wasted hands
clasped in the strong brown hands of
Georg Lea looked at him In ecstacy.
When the train was carrying her toward
Torquay, a short time before, she had
asked herself: "Which Georg am I going
to see again? The one whom I knew be
fore his initiation or the one after? Tho
chosen brother or the imperious conquer
or?" And now that he was before her
ehe could not have replied to herself. Tho
man she saw was different from the two
others and yet borrowed something from
each of them. The tan of the face, and
perhaps the outdoor life of fatig-ulns
walks and dangerous cruises which ho
had led for a year, had preserved in him
the energetic and yet deliberate air that
had distressed Lea when she had seen
him In Paris upon his return from Italy.
But all the despotic violence had disap
peared, and even at times his glance, tha
poise of his head, and the movements or
his wearied hands, the troubled tone of
his voice, recalled the lethargical bear-
Ing of former times which had made
Frederique and Lea compare him to a
warrior, of the Scandinavian paradise
struck down by some secret wound.
THE SUNDAY OAIiI*.
(Continued Next Sunday J
Her hospital companions, almost all
London workwomen â for the Commercial
Road Hospital had been founded by sev
eral big London manufacturers who had
formed a syndicate in the cause of chari
tyâtalked with her freely. She had been
too well trained in Paris and London, as
a teacher and apostle, by Mme. Sanz,
Edith Craggs, Frederique and Ilomaine
Pirnitz not to know how to speak to them
and to makÂ« herself beloved by them. One
of the women. May Bodson, a little bur
nisher, who had run away from home
with a lover and, abandoned by him, had
in her face, and the least touch bruised
her.
When once more in bed, with dry linen,
she would give way to a melancholy pros
tration as though she had been beaten.
She would slumber again, half conscious
of tho gentle murmur that awaking day
reanimated in the big ward. Breakfast
would be brought to the patients, the
plentiful breakfast of the Anglo-Saxons,
fried .soles, tggs and smoked bacon, gril
led kidneys, murmalnde, all washed down
with scalding hot tea or coffee and milk,
for the' phvsucian of this ward. Dr. Alns
worth of the Itoyal Medical and Chirurgi
cal Society, was a believer in and advo
cate of over alimentation as a cure for
consumption. Nothing that the patients
desired to eat was refused them. Some
abused this liberty and devoured extra
ordinary supplies of hard boiled eggs,
with quarts of milk, between the four
regular dailv meals. Ix-a ate but little;
all food disgusted her. and she finally took
nothing but a little tea. an egg and some
buttered toast. Dr. Ainsworth was very
angry with her and accused her of ob
stinacy and ill will.
"You will never recover unless you eat.
Simply owing to your ailment you lose an
amount of vitality daily which is, let us
say. compared to the total amount of your
vitality as 1 is to 20o. And yet you re
plenish nothing, because you don't eat!
You can calculate for yourself the mo
ment when your vitality will be ex
hausted."
His pupils, gathered around the bed de
lighted will the mathematical precision of
his formula, agreed with him. Lea closed
her eye-s: her modesty was no longer
wounded by the caze of these men, who
regarder her as n subject for a medical
demonstration. She simply wished they
would leave her alone; that they would
no longer sneak to her of food, of which
even the thought made her feel faint.
The doctor, a little, bearded, gesticulat
ing individual, would lead his band of
pupils to another bed. Then the rest of
the day. until nlehtfall, was fairly sup
portable to the Invalid.
She suffered very little, and the Intens
ity of her thoughts and longings was suffi
cient to nil the wearily long hours.
reanimated Lea. She had Immediately
submitted to Dr. Ainsworth's prescrip
tions. She ate the dozen hard boiled eggs
and drank the four quarts of milk a day
in addition to the ordinary meals. She
was in a hurry to get up and walk; to go
away, but at the same time she begged
Edith 'not to warn Georg, no"t to tell him
that she was In London. She dreaded co
sec him hasten to her before she had
recovered her health, before she was pret
ty again.
And it was also in order to arrive at
Torquay fresh and untired that they had
decided to break the journey at Salisbury,
the little sleepy, picturesque town hair
way between London and Torquay.
A deep, brazen tolling fell from the
stone steeple and rang through the warm,
limpid air above the deserted square,
through the half leafless branches of the
red elms and over the capriciously shaped
roofs of the old houses.
* "One o'clock!" said Lea. "Still three
hours and a half before we shah arrive!
Can It be true? Am I not dreaming? I
have dreamed it -already many a time,
Edith, and afterward have awakened
wretched upon my hospital bed. Tell me
that it Is true, that I am not dreaming."
"It is quite true, dear, and you are not
dreaming. The Lord Jesus has tried you,
has ground you like corn. But he is lead-
Ing you to your husband to-day."
And, as was her custom, she quoted a
verse of the Psalms:
"Hearken, my daughter, and see. and
Incline thine ear; forget thy country and
the house of thy father,"
"Dear Edith," murmured Lea.
With a graceful gesture she took her
In 5 both her arms and kissed her upon
"both cheeks. ; She loved her. She liked her
comforting presence and the perpetual
strain of, Christian piety with which she
accompanied the least Important occasion
of her life, .
"Don't I look tired. Edith?" asked Lea,
suddenly, after a short silence.
"You look as though you had been 111
and were, getting better, you dear little
thing," replied Edith. "But I assure you
you are very pretty."
Edith,, very coquettish for her whom she
had recreated, and whom she was so
proud to. lead to her betrothed, as she
had always hoped in former times, looR
etl at the -young girl with satisfaction,
though not without anxiety. Dr. Ains
worth had not beon too confident when
they left London.
"She- hag recovered astonishingly. She
may be completely cured, although both
lungs, and even the vocal cords, are at
tacked."
"Oh!" thought Edith. "She Is too act
ive, too beautiful. She must not die; she
cannot!" . â¢ -
. She cast a Bldelong glance at Lea, who
was oblivious, buried in this dreanv-"!
bathing in a creek. An this flashed past
the carriage windows like views seen in
a rapid cinematograph. Soothed by their
rapid fight and amused by the Incessant
change of the pictures. Lea gave herself
up to a delicious lethargy. As they wÂ«.re
leaving Newton Abbot station Edith
closed her book and, leaning over toward
her companion, said in a low tone, so that
their fellow-passengers could not overbear
her:
"You remember what you promised me.
Lea?"
"Yes, dear," replied Lea: "I remember."
She pressed her hand as though to sea]
the vow she had already made. This
promise, which Edith had demanded and
insisted upon before she would consent to
take Lea to Georg, was that as soon as
they were at Torquay they should be mar
ried by a priest. It was only upon this
condition that the pious little creature
would lead the betrothed girl to the arms
of her sweetheart.
"And you will not wait until you are
quite better? As soon aa .it is possible
you will send for the clergyman? In fact,
I will look after it myself."
Lea smilingly said yes. The religious
fervor which she had felt awakening with
in her at the threshold of St. Augoisttn's
Church the evening of her departure from
Paris, and later In the hospttal during her
conversations with Father Patrick, was
no longer as keen as formerly. And yet
she was pleased with the thought of kneel
ing at Georg's side before a minister of
her traditional religion. Georg would
certainly agree to it, if only to save dear
Edith from a horrible grief.
The sea was no longer visible. The train
was flying across an undulated plain, bor
dered on the left by low hlll9. One of the
travelers looked at his watch and said:
"Another ten minutes beforo we reach
Torquay. We are late."
Lea, quivering with nervous emotion,
felt her thoughts full of Georg. She di
vined him yonder, waiting upon th^ sta
tion platform for the arrival of the train
awaiting her with an emotion that equal
ed her own. She. felt, so to speak, her
longing go out to meet him before her.
She wished to conjure up his image in her
mental vision. She closed her eyes, bent
all the strength of her imagination and
memory upon it. But the rebellious vision
eluded her, or rather became double.
Which Georg was she going to meet in a
few moments?
The one she had known and left In Lon
donâthe only one whom she could have
loved then, because ho appeared to her
under the unexpected and extraordinary
form of a chaste man, indifferent to all
sensuality, obedient to the injunctions of
his conscience, even to the extent of ac
complishing deeds that the ordinary hu
man being looked upon as madness, as,
: "Yes; I know where they are. I will- tell
you, and we will' go'and reioln them as
Boon as you are well enough." ' '
Lea drew. a deep breath, as In the time
when her lungs caused her no suffering.
"We shall leave? .We shall go to them?"
she said. "Then I want to live." â¢.>_Â¦
She closed her eyes obediently and fell
Into a deep sleep, while Edith, Bitting by
"Do not leave me!" she repeated.
"No. Now so to sleep. , I will talk to
you at breakfast. All is well."
"Do you know?" began Lea. Â¦
She could say no more, so extreme was
her weakness. But Edith had under
stood. Â¦;Â¦ Â¦ .
"Don't excite yourself," sold Edith, lay
ing Lea's head and shoulders back upon
the pillow. "Try to sleep until breakfast,
then we can talk. I received your letter
at last, after it had followed me , for a..
long time. I have been here for two
days."
"Don't leave me!" begged Lea.
The Increasing daylight showed to the
sick girl's eyes the odd rosy face of Edith,
more extraordinary than' ever In her
nurse's costume. And Lea could not look
at Edith long enough. Hope returned to
her suddenly. She had come back from
the bottom of the pit to light and life.

EASY STEP FROM ONE HUNDRED YEARS BACK TO TWENTY-FIVE - WHEN YOU KNOE NOW
8
fT is an easy enough matter to retreat
. from the asc of 100 to 25 in three hours,
o provided you know how. There is to
be found an opera wherein the "magic
kiss" is supposed to do the whole thing.
It is a very pretty theory, and, taken al
legorieally, Where's the cynic who dare as
sert there's nothing in it? But taken lit
erally, grease paint is at the bottom of it.
Eowin Stevens, or Baroa de Grimm, sets
out upon his evening's jourr.ey as a cen
tenarian, passes by way of a doddering
c:d beau to a tartly middle-aged hunts
man, and winds up as a smartly groomed
and gilttcriasr y<~ung officer. The kiss does
r.ot do It and the make-up does.
In the lace of the fact that he owns to
be:rg; of an artist himself. Mr.
Steve::s nates that the ability to draw
has nothing in the world to do with the
ability to make up. "It's one thing to
make Hr.es that will mean something on
canvas or paper.** ho says, "and quite an-
loned cacn nis" 1 - anu Â«* re Â»Â«Â»*=Â« v* mean*
of "spirit sum." a preparation made for
the use of actors.
The last act of "Madeleine" ihowa Mr.
Stevens as a dashing young soldier of 33.
The change" takes but a few minutes. ThÂ«
hunting costume of the Baron of 60 is
exchanged for the military uniform worn
by the nobles of the period of the play.
Once again the "make-up" 13 wiped ofr,
grease paint of a juvenile flesh color ar.l
pink powder are applied, and we see the
Baron of 25. He i3 beg^Med and be
eagled and It Is hard to believe that he la
the same man as the centenarian who
started out toothless and ridged thrÂ»->
hours before. 'â¢ J
cthrr to :ra!<- Yi.c to fce exposed to tte
footlights-. A wrinkle is mnue in one way
in a picture ar.-J in another in a make-up."
He- hat a theory, ail his own. that th<^
character acicr develops lines in his face
from the persistent drawing of them. It
looks plausible. We all know the little
girl who bored the dimple in her chin
tilth a insistent slate pencil. .

has ever etÂ«dlecl a centenarian's wrinkles
he dees not fay. How many of his audi
ence iiave. li? does not ask. His ancient
Baj-on Ih at least convincing enough for
all fcta^e purposes.
The T-.allitl color is secured by a "grease
paint" cf pigmeiit. u . in which bismuth pre
dominates. The stick of "grease paint"
is melted in a gas flame and is rubbed on
the face, v.hi'-h is then carefully covered
xvith a white face powder.
The eyebrjowa are whitened and then
comes the cartful work of "lining ihe
face."
With a specially prepared pointer the
lines are drawn in on the forehead, the
cheeks and ihe chir.; and the effect or
sur.kon cheeks i& secured by the use of a
'.'lead-colored 1 groane paint."
A centenarian veyy rarely possesses any
teeth, ai;4 the effect uf a toothless man is
made by painting the teeth wi;h a black
color tir tlio use of black v.ax.
As in "i'aust," the change to a younger
man is nj.udc on the stage. After receiv
ing the magic kiss of "Madeleine,"? the
Karon dc CJrfmir, surrounded V>y his ser
vants, transforms his appearance in the
space of a few seconds. -The cloak and
head-dress are taken off, the Ions white
beard is removed, and presto, the Baron
i.s 75 years old. Nobody sees the attend
ant who smuggles his senility off into the
wingr. End nobody wants to ste him. He
is a worthy man v.-ho earns every red
penny of his salary, but he spoils the
poetry of thins.--.
"l don't Bad it accessary to change the
face lines for the step to seventy-five,"
Mr. Stevens Fay3,""Ior 1 f.hlnk that by

The features of the elderly Baron are

We were placed under a painful scru

us. But there was the letter with its de
mand for surrender and a statement â
what that was J will not say. Then ther%
were our faces. I have stayed in a poker
game on a very small hand once in a
while, but that was' the smallest yet.-
Still the hand could not be played to win.
A bluff was all that we could make and
our lives wtJre at rtake.
Questions were directed upon us In
every way. possible, seeking to discover
affairs, for Venandro Canon was a man
who had been educated in France and
had Western, skill grafted upon Oriental
cunning. Â¦
For each question there was the same'
answer, "The letter." Upon that our
lives were hanging. What was In it we

Our rush was a grand, success. The:
United States forces had licked the Span
ish, and the Spanish had mastered the
Filipinos. Stories of the awful Americans,
mounted on flying monsters that came
charging through the air In the face of
death, clearing all obstructionsâ stories
; told them by the Spaniards of the fright
ful ferocity of the white-faced devilsâ all
these things had put thorn In a frame of
mind such as only a child In the dark
knows.
So when we charged on the garrison of
Dupax there was nothing resisted us but
the houses and the deserted barricades,
.over which we leaped our horses without
Inquiring what was ahead of us.
That is the way to get the good effect
of cavalry. It was the same story as all
of the successful cavalry charges that
ever were made. Just sit down and ride
for all you know, iho faster -the better. -
The expectation of a hot fire was agree
ably disappointed, and when the dust
rleared away we saw happy faces, for the'
first time in many anxious days. |

gathered from the ports of the
five continents and unnumbered islands of
the earth.
That Is briefly the Mariners' Church on
the water front. Under the same spire
and Gothic roof nestle the oddest little
church in America, and the headquarters
of a large and busy steam laundry.
There is pood thrift in this, for the rents
of the ground floor Manchisserle have for
years fco!r*ed to support the soul-cleans
ing efforts uristalrs.
It is a carious place of worship; odd in
more than one way. In architecture, it
follows tbe conventional Gothic of half
o. century ago. with an extreme spire.
Rut there the conventionality of thÂ«
church ceases.
Insioe of the building Is part of the
hull of a ship, which constitutes the pul
pU. and a desk at the steering wheel
6erves as the altar.
It is one of the nldest places of wor-
Eh'.p in the city, and has been a fixture in
Its present location for forty years, while
Its sectarian t-isters have moved about,

ble parishioners, or boldly adventuring

are a'l in their proper positions, made
by a conscientious shipwright who built
a pulr:t 3fter the only model that he

It is an allegory which a sailor can un

he clawed and climbed his way up the
ehlngles until his arms clasped the pole
that tips the spire and his feet rested on
the shelving ledge.
Here the horror of his situation gradu

He saw his awful position and the wasted
life which had led* to it.
He had been closely followed by two
companions.
They secured a long ladder, and lash-

tension, one of them cllmbe.l the steeple
by its aid, taking a long rope with him.
Passing the rope around the pinnacle
of the spire, he tied the end of it to tho
waist of the nearly exhausted debauchee,
who was then lowered by the man below
paying out the rope. The rescuer slid
down with safety and the incident was
ended for him. But not so wtth the man
who had made the climb. He looked upon
â¢the adventure as devised to point a
moral.

because in each of the countless little col

left, and all these combine. to overshadow
the baldness. Herr Pohl's invest isatlor.a
give the deathblow to many old-time the

will prove of rare interest and value to
many scientists.
He further maintains that hair grows
more slowly after it is cut than at any
other time, and that several days will
elapse before It begins to grow af the
normal rate. Furthermore, he noticed that
hair after being cut does not grow in a
uniform manner. The reason la because
hairs are not Independent, so to speak,
but are clustered together in little colo
nies, each of which contains from two
to four hairs. One of these hairs always
grows faster than the others, but only
for a certain time, for before H has at
tained Its full growth the adjoining hair
begins to sprout up, and in thi3 way the
hairs of each colony successively, attain
their full length.

PALL. HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL.
WASHINGTON, June 23.â Four thousand" five hundred
men under command of Brigadier General R. H. Hall
\jj and a fleet of -sixteen men-of-war and five hundred ma-
rlnes under command of Rear Admiral Kempff will com-'
prise; the Amerjcarj forces which will protect Americans and
their interests in China.
Alarmed at the grave outlook in the Celestial empire, the
President is determined* to use every available means to pro
vide adequate prgtection for American interests. The brigade,
which will consist of three regiments and a. battery of artil
lery, will be hastened from the Philippines, leaving on or after
next Wednesday. The authorities will not say what regiments,
but it is believed they are some of those In or near Manila.
General MacArthur cabled the department to-day that "the
departure of the Ninth Infantry was delayed until June 27 In
consequence of a storm v.-hieh broke the railway and telegraph
lines and made the approach to the transports impossible."
The Sixth Cavalry, which is to start from Manila July 1,
will be available for service should .an additional force be. re
quired. General Hall, who will command the troops, has been
in the Philippines siace before the rebellion began. He holds
the rank In the rogular army as colonel of the Fourth Infantry-
While at Fort Sheridan several years ago he sustained an
officer who dragged an" enlisted man from the guardhouse to
the courtroom, where he was to be tried for a petty offense,
ar.d in consequence has been regarded as, in a. measure, under
a cloud. He has done effective service in the Philippines.
Lieutenant General Miles called upon the President this after
noon and his presence at the White House started reports that
he was going to China, which -are not believed to have any
foundation.' General'Miles' declined to discuss the sto/Ies. -
One of the ships ordered yesterday to Taku is the monitor
Monadnock, and she will carry with her, as will the other ves
sels sent, as many marines from Cavlte as Admiral Remey can
possibly spare. What other vessels have been ordered to the
scene of action are not stated, but It Is believed that the
Princeton and Marietta' have been sent, and perhaps the New
Orleans and -two of the small gunboats. In addition' to these
vessels the department has directed that the -Alexander, Saturn
and Hannibal be placed in condition for service in China. The
collier Caesar has been held at Norfolk and will probably be
ordered to China. , and the tank , ship Arethusa and collier
Sinda, now at Gibraltar, may be sent to the far East. The dis
patch of so many colliers is due to the action of merchants in
the far East in putting up the price of coal, and it will be more
economical to ship fuel in Government vessels to China.
While the authorities are apparently placing much confi
dence In the representations made by foreign governments they
are thus takir.g measures to show them that in any deviation
from the policy of co-operation now being framed the United
States' must be reckoned with.
A ray of light came in the Chinese situation to-day when
Wu Ting Fang. Chinese Minister to the United States, received
a dispatch from the- Viceroy of Nankin saying: ' "AH foreign
Ministers well. Telegraph line interrupted. Cannot obtain any
additional news." Minister. Wu communicated this informa
tion to Secretary Hay and it was quickly disseminated among
the various officials. The authorities do not place entire reli
ance in it, however, because the Viceroy in his message admits
that he Is not in telegraphic communication with Peking.
Another communication of great importance was received
from LI Hung Chang, Viceroy of Canton, who gives his per
sonal assurance that the firing upon the foreign fleets at Taku
was not authorized by the Chinese Government. He asks au
thority of the powers to procead to Peking for the purpose of
putting an end to the disturbances there, a plan in which his
great Influence both with the court and with the people gives
some promise of success. Â£The United States and it is believed
NEW YORK, Jnne 23â Admiral Bruce'* hope that relief would

the city on Thursday failed, and whether success has erowned the
efforts of the stronger international force which was ready to make a
second attempt on the same day. Is not known.
" How urgent was the need of relief was told la a dispatch from
Lieutenant Kempff in Tientsin. Xearly all the foreign concessions

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"It is of the greatest importance that if possible there shall
be some arrangement made by which men who retain their
Influence shall be placed In positions to maintain themselves
and preserve order. Many people say that fifty thousand
trcops will not be sufficient to establish order. This will un
doubtedly be true If we find wo are fighting a nation of 300.000,
010. But we must find out what kind of government there is in
Peking and whether it Is sanctioning opposition to the allied
troops before we can say whether or not: there Is a state of
war. We have at this time absolutely no evidence of hostHIty
of the central government, and Li Hung Chang says it is not
hostile." Â¦Â¦-'Â¦Â¦â¢.
"What makes the situation so extremely difficult to under
stand Is that wo do not know nor doÂ«Â« the Government of any
natlon know whether the Imperial Government sactlons the usÂ©
of Chinese troops against the allied forces. It is quite possible,
In view of the dispatch received by the State Department from
the three great Viceroys of the empire, that the central Gov
ernment at Peking has lost its gTip. :^.'c
"The United States has not been approached by any power
relative to the dismemberment of China.' The matter has not
been discussed. From every Cabinet there is exactly the same
expression of opinion. They are not In an attitude of hostility
to the Chinese Government and their troops are In China sim
ply to protect their nationalists and preserve order.
"The moment it is considered that a state of war exists,"
eald an official who discussed the situation to-day, "interna
tional difficulties will greatly multiply. Each power will then
suspect that the other proposes to seize the territory Its troops
enter and co-operation between* the forces may become im
possible. The object of all the powers at this time Is to put
down mobs and rioters, and their co-operation makes, the situ
ation simple.
Several important communications have been received by
the Secretary of State justifying the attitude assumed ty this
Government that, technically speaking, a state of war does
not exist between the United States and China. The Viceroys
who have their peats of government at Nankin an-'l Wu Chang,
and who govern five great provinces in the Yangtse Kiang re
gion, have assured this Government that they are determined
and perfectly, able to. preserve order in .their jurisdictions and
protect the lives and property- of foreigners. - In reply to th'.s
they have been that so long as they are- able to main
tain order and protect life and property In the provinces under
their control the Government of the United States will send no
troops Into that region and will use its influence with other
powers In the same direction. The President is hopeful that
none of the powers will consider a state of war exists.
The attitude of the United States toward China in view of
the military operations in progress at Tientsin has received
the careful consideration of the President and his Cabinet, and
Secretary Hay has been in communication with foreign gov
ernments on the question whether or not war exists. This
statement may be regarded as authoritative.-
New gravity was added. to the aspect of affairs In Tientsin
by the receipt to-day of a dispatch from Rear Admiral Kempff,
concerning which an official statement was issued.
other powers, have assented to, this proposition of Li Hung
Chang and he is supposed to have started' for Peking.
It is thought both here and in European capitals that the
Empress Dowager and the Tsung-Ll-Yamen may now believe
that the threatened dismemberment of China is In -progress
and that the foreign troops. Instead of entering the empire to
aid the dynasty, are Invading It preliminarily to dividing up
the country. Li Hung Chang Is expected to put the matter in
its proper light. But he cannot reach Peking in less than two
weeks, and meanwhile military operations on a large scale
must be started to relieve the foreign Consuls and citizens at
Tientsin and foreign legations and foreigners, and perhaps
Vice Admiral Seymour's column In or near Peking.

AMERICA HOLDS
KEY TO SITUATION
SHANGHAI. June 23.â Foreigners and
commercial men at all cf the treaty ports
are of the opinion that the Chinese gov
ernment has been wrecked beyond repair
and that the only solution for the exist
ing anarchy will be the establishment of
a new government controlled by the civ
ilized nations. Attempts to restore the
Empress on the basis of her foreordained
promise of good behavior would make the
position of the foreigners worse than ever.
A popular plan is the restoration of the
Emperor, if found alive. With liberal ad
visers he could be held subject to strict
supervision by some council representing
the foreign powers. The personal punish
ment of the highest officials concerned in
the anti-foreign movement Is considered
essential. Interest Is focussed on Russia
and America. It Is the universal belief
that Russia Instigated noting, expecting
to march an army to Pekjng and pro
claim himself protector of China under
the guise of restoring order, but achieved
a fiasco on account of the prompt action
of the other powers.
America, who is considered to hold the
key to the situation. because of not being
under suspicion of land- grabbing motives,
is, in the best position to take the lead in
making proposals for a permanent ar
rangement. There Is a practical Anglo-
American alliance in China. The commer
cial organizations of both nationalities
are urging their respective governments
to hurry more troops. The presence of
European soldiers to force the demands
upon China, besides being in position to
check the ambitions of rival powers., Is
deemed advisable. There are not suffi
cient English troops present to protect In
terests at treaty ports. The English and
Americans confidently expect that sev
eral regiments will be pent from the Phil
ippines without delay.

bers of its own party â the Conservative.
I do not think that the Ministry can vic
toriously withstand these attacks, which,
so far as the financial operation of June
4. is concerned, are justified.
. The division of the Conservative party
that is not Silvelalst would like to form
a ministry upon the basis of Conservative
concentration, with Marshal Martinez
Campos or the Duke of Tetuan as Premier
of the Council, but there appear to be
email chances of such desire Deing real
ized. In fact, the probabilities are that
it Â¦will be Senor Sagasta, leader of the
Liberal party, who will be recalled to
power should Senor Silvela's Cabinet fall.

He denied that it was race troubles that

he continued, always existed and arma

lent shoe can be produced to sellat the price. The fact is, this factory makes only Sorosis. The workmen are drilled each to do their parts to perfection. The capacity of 5000 pairs of Sorosis Shoes daily makes possible the
selling of such an excellent shoe at the price. When the factory made-but 300 pairs per day, the retail price was $6.00. Now the immense production with great economy and small profits makes possible the best Ready-to-
Wear Shoe made in the world for$3.5o per.pair. It has long been our desire to have some of the Sorosis customers visit the factory in Lynn, Mass., and observe its perfect organization, and we hail with pleasure the opportunity of
oflfering to those visiting the Paris Exposition the arrangements made, whereby free tickets from Boston to the factory and return to Boston will be furnished" on application at the Royal. A letter of introduction

. Since the introduction of Sorosis the imitators have been legion; multitudes of so-called special shoes have been boomed, evidently with the thought, that noisy .publicity was the only essential requisite for success. But the
thoughtful people learn after a brief experience that TRUE Merit is based on good materials, fine, workmanship and perfect fitting qualities. One of the purposes of this advertisement is to explain to you how such an excel-
lent shoe can be produced to sellat the price. The fact is, this factory makes only Sorosis. The workmen are drilled each to do their parts to perfection. The capacity of 5000 pairs of Sorosis Shoes daily makes possible the
selling of such an excellent shoe at the price. When the factory made-but 300 pairs per day, the retail price was $6.00. Now the immense production with great economy and small profits makes possible the best Ready-to-
Wear Shoe made in the world for$3.5o per.pair. It has long been our desire to have some of the Sorosis customers visit the factory in Lynn, Mass., and observe its perfect organization, and we hail with pleasure the opportunity of
oflfering to those visiting the Paris Exposition the arrangements made, whereby free tickets from Boston to the factory and return to Boston will be furnished" on application at the Royal. A letter of introduction
from us will also insure courteous treatment and expert guides through the' entire establishment . " ,;;Â¦/Â¦

The veil drawn over events in Peking
by the interruption of communication
serves to increase the anxiety felt here.
M. Delcasse, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
speaking to-day" upon the situation, gave
it as his opinion that the purpose of the
united powers was to overcome the re
bellion and to insure the safety of lives
and property of all foreigners.
Anxiety Over Chinese Situation.
"Russia has lost a sincere admirer In
Count Muravieff," said Mr. Hutchinson.
"We found him a man of great scholarly
attainments and unusually conversant
' with affairs In the ITnlted States and with
American institutions. It was gratifying
to us to learn of bis acquaintance with
the educational institutions of our coun
try. Our Interview with the Czar we con
sider more of a compliment to Mr.
Tower's relations toward the Russian
court than to ourselves. It left us with a
thorough Impression that the Czar was a
man of a strong, progressive mind, and
although hampered in the fulfillment of
his ideas by traditions and his deep
rooted interest in the aristocracy, ye* In
the course of time he will undoubtedly
reach the goal toward which he is work
ing and place his country In the very
\-ansuard of commercial progress. We
found tn the Czar none of the cold re
serve usually associated with monarch-.
He has a frank, candid manner and is
kindly of speech."
Speaking of their reception among the
Russians generally, they emphasized the
hospitality of the nation and the evident
desire to aid foreigners In securing infor
mation about their country. Even among
the peasant class there was nothing of
that antipathy to " aliens so noticeable
abroad In many countries. . %
A warm appreciation of Count Mura
vieff was expressed to-day by Charles
Hutchinson and Martin Ryerson, who,
with Charles Crane and President W. R.
Harper, all of Chicago, recently had an
interview with the Czar and Count Mu
ravieff.
Tribute to MuraviefT.
The removal of Count Muravieff from
the Council of the Czar Is gravely com
mented upon by the French press, and in
the hopes expressed that the policy of
Russia will not be affected thereby one
discerns apprehension lest the foundation
of the Franco-Russian alliance should be
rudely shaken by the lopping off of one
of Its strongest roots. M. Delcasse him
self, talking with a friend on the subject,
set aside these fears, laying- stress on the
fact that while the personal feelings of
Muravieff were of great value In cement
ing sympathetic accord between the two
nations, yet the real Foreign Minister was
the Czar and he has given repeated tok
ens of sincere friendship for France.
Therefore, according to M. Delcasse.
Frenchmen could regard the political fu
ture with perfect serenity.
and France, moreover, have not rested
upon a purely political basis. A great
element of strength v/as found In the
personal friendship existing between M.
Delcasse, French Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, and Count Muravieff, and to the
former the loss of his friend came as a
severe blow.
Muravieff was a bitter antagonist of Eng
land, and in him France felt that she had
an influential friend in the event of diffi
culties with Great Britain. The cordial
relations of the foreign officers of Russia
Franco-Russian alliance, has caused deep
concern among the members of the
French onlcial and political world. Count

i has caused more real anguish to Hank's

' crepped a fly after a hard run. That In
itself is rot a crime of crimes, but there
, were three Senators prancing on the bag3

these solor.s were over the plate.
There were several grief-augmenting cir
cumstances attached to this material er
ror of Brockhoff. Two men dressed in
the tcsa. had already been put upon the
; slabs of death. Then again in this In
'â¢ rungâ the third â Uncle's men had found
! Mr Doyie and they scattered his curves
' over the field for thrse hits ar.d four
runs, giving Hank thÂ« lead by a tally.
1 Uncle's joy was cf short duration. When
the inning* was completed the score stood
7-4 in favcr of Sacramento.
The tirst inning showed Uncle's "saur-
I krauf team in bad colors. With a bit of
1 lu"k, a hit and convenient errors, three
j Senators, McLaughlln, Eagan and
H-aghes, crossed the plate.
For a few moments the local team re
deemed Itself In the third. Brockhoff led
off with a single, scoring on Hildebrand's
two bagger. An error by Eagan. which
pave Schwartz his base, and a base on
balls to Sullivan filled the bags. Pabst
then swatted the ball to a safe spot In
center field, both Hildebrand and
Schwartz tallying. Sully scored on &
passed balL That was all, but It gave
the local team a temporary lead. Imme
diately after came the funeral. Dever
eaui walked to first. Hughes gt>t there
on a hit and Hanlon was another walker.
There were two outs by this time and
then the fun began. Stanley's bit to
Brockhoff did it. the sacks being emptied
ar.d Stanley resting on second only to be
brought in over the plate by a double
which went to the credit of Doyle.
Iburg pitched better ball than Doyle, but

on third. On the throw In of Schwartz's

vicinity. A mass meeting was called fcr
to-night on the lower plaza and the at
tendance was much better than the most
optimist of party leaders expected.
Bonfires were lighted, red fire glowed.
anvils boomed and bands rendered martial
music.
Enthusiastic speeches were make- by
J. XT. Linscott. C. E. Lindsay, Duncan

tiuslasm ran high. Bonfires were kindled,
salutes fired and flaming rockets rent the
heavens. Brass bauds played martial airs
and millionaire and worklngman marched
ehoulder to shoulder In procession.
Thousands gathered around hastily con- Â¦
ctructed platforms and cheered them
selves hoarse at the mention of the names
of the great parry leaders. Speakers noted
far and wide fcr their oratorical ability
and men from the masses alike aroused
the enthusiasm of the assembled multi
tudes.
In no place was there a cut and dried
programme "with stereotyped speeches and
mathematically calculated pauses for ap

having been lead astray and pledged
themselves even to the principles of the

Chinese Girl Tells the Story of Her
SAN JOSE, June 23.-Kim Quey, the
Chinese girl who figures in the Palo Alto
abduction cases, took the stand this
morning: in the trial of Wong Fong. She
appeared in American costume and was
hardly recognizable as the same girl who
was dramatically introduced by Attorney
B. A. Herrington at the mass-meeting In
this city called to condemn the action of
the perpertators of the Palo Alto out
rage. She is a rather good looking Chi
nese girl of about 18 years.
Kim Quey. through an interpreter, said
that she was In the mission with Miss
Cameron, but was taken from there by
Wong Hing Ding, Wong Fong and an of
ficer whom she identified as Deputy Con
stable Tom Harris. She told substan
tially the same story Miss Cameron told
yesterday. She said she came to this
country to attend'thc Omaha Exposition
and later came to Sikn Francisco. The
girl told of the trip to Palo Alto. When
asked Â¦why they went into the country,
she Bald for no particular reason except
that some one got out a paper to take
her.
Kim Quey said that it was "Wong Hlng
Ding who took hold of her, and that Har
ris gave the warrant to Miss Cameron.
Then she said they all four took a ride
into the country, the two Chinese, Miss
Cameron and Harris being included In the
party. According to the witness, they
went to a hotel at Palo Alto, where they
stopped and stayed for^some little time.
After that they went to a dirty place, the
jail.
Kim Quey told of some one calling to
them to open the dcor of the Jail, which
had been locked with sticks,-" as she ex
pressed it, and finally they pushed the
door open and a white man took hold of
her and she grot into a wagon. When
asked if she went willingly or was forced
to get into the rig, she said:
"It was not myself that went there, but
they helped me In."
An attempt was made to have her Iden
tify Justice Dyer of Palo Alto, but she
did not recognize him.
The cross-examination was continued
this afternoon.

charges Dr. Twitchell, an interne at tire
hospital and a very intimate friend of the
ageu Fuperintendt-nt, resigned his position
and left for parts unknown. Twitchell
h^d been an interne at the asylum for
several years, and many of the employed
of that institution are ready to trsiify to
the fact that be had been frequently seen
in company with "a female inmate who
had been committed to the hospital from
Arcata, Humboidt County. The woman in
question is young and prepossessing, and
the charge against her was dipsomania.
Svhen Twitchell was lirst suspected of
having furnished her with liquor sho was
discharged as cured and Twitchell was
given a vacation for a couple of. months.
When the little storm blew over Twitch
ell returned and remained here until the
recent charges against L>r. King were pre
ferred. Now he is gone.
There is a public school near the asylum,
and several of the trustees are employes
of that institution. Some time ago there
was a vacancy in the prineipalsnip, and
Secretary Handy wanted the place for a
near relative. He had heard, however,
tnat D. K. McKinley, tlreman at the asy
lum, together with another member of the
board ot trustees, had pledged the position
to a lady named Mrs. Gannon, who had
previously taught the school. Mr. Handy
then, according to the charge liled with
the board of managers, approached Mc-
Kinley and told him that it he wished to
hold nis place he would better Vote for
the party whom the secretary wanted.
McKinley, seeing the sword suspended
over his head, did as requested, and Air.
Handy's relative got the place. At the
school election held June 1 Mr. Handy
made the same play and his relative still
holds the place. *
Behind ail this excitement at the asy
lum there ls a pretty little story of polit
ical intrigue and chicanery, in the local
cajTipalgn of IMS the delegation from this
county to the State convention had been
pledged for Senator Thomas Flint for
Governor long before their election by A.
M. Duncan, who posed as a t>olitical
leader of the push of the Third Supervi
sorial District. He openly asserted at
that time that unless he could cast the
vole of the delegation for his favorite
candidate he would do what he could to
defeat the Republican party at the ap
proaching election. When the leaders ot
the party learned of the arrogant claims
made by Duncan they rebelled. Duncan
had been a member of the Board of Su
pervisors which had been Indicted for
malfeasance in ofilce. The board was
tried and acquitted of the charge, al
though the evidence of Its culpability
was regarded as complete. It simply
escaped on a technicality. That shows
the character of the man and explains
why the leaders of the party objected to
being classed as willing tools of the Dun
can push.
The Intention of the Duncan faction,
however, to prostitute the delegation to
its own end, was not known until too late
to prevent It. The convention was held
at r'oint Arena, Duncan's home, a point
so distant from the center of population
that but few delegates were present In
person. The opposition to the pledging of
the delegation to Senator Flint was not
personal. It was slmplx a protest to the
arrogant claim made that a man of Dun
can's character could control the party
in this county. In this little matter the
Duncan-Handy push was aided by G. A.
Sturtevant, who had prosecuted Duncan
when he was arraigned by- the court, and
who was perfectly familiar with Mr. Dun 7
can's standing as an official and a man.
Sturtevant had alao been tried on a fel
ony charge, but had been acquitted. His
case was brought before two separate
Grand Juries, but as Sturtevant was at
that time District Attorney, and thus had
the privilege of the Jury room. It was held
that no charge would He against him un
less preferred by the Attorney General.
This was never done. Sturtevant's term

cure a position In San Francisco. Duncan
wished to get a place for a brother In the

It was for this that they were working.
T. L. Carothers was opposed to boss rule
In the county. He had been one of the
pioneers who had fought for the success
of the Republican party from the organi
zation of the county, and did not desire to
see It dominated by the disreputable ele
ment. He therefore succeeded in organia
Ing the County Central Committee ana
thus effectually knocked out the Duncan-
Handy push. Then it was that that ele
ment determined to avenge Itself. Dr.
King had been elected medical super
, lntendent through the assistance of Mr.
Carothers. who was at that time one of
the directors and chairman of the board.
He owed everything political to Carothers,
but he listened to the domineering voice
of his secretary and discharged M. M.
Carothera In order to avenge hjmself upon
the father of the deposed engineer.

The wheat crop in California in
1S9S, according to the figures of the
Produce Exchange, was 7,341,000
centals, or 367,000 tons, in round
numbers. This was the dry year.
The crop of 1S99 was about 1.003,500
tons. The crop of 1900 is variously
estimated at from 900,000 to 1,100,000
tons, the general opinion being
that It will fall slightly below the
drop of 1SD0. As it Is not yet har
vests, no figures can be given.
Vhe Northwestern failure will
hardly draw on California directly,
but by decreasing exports from
Atlantic ports to Europe It will of
course tend to increase the exports
from California. Wheat, .like wa
ter, seeks its level everywhere, and
if one country has not got it to sell
consumers must look for their sup
plies to that country which has.
Hence any material disaster to the
wheat crop anywhere Is felt all
over the world, as wheat Is a uni
versal proposition.
CHICAGO. June 23.â July wheat was
quoted at 66Vi cents on the Board of
Trade during the session of June 4. At
the close to-day the same option was
selling at 88 cents. This was 4% cents
above the closing price of yesterday. No
guch advance has been scored since the
attempted corner engineered by Joseph
Leiter.
Jn the advance of 21Â»Â£ cents during the
past nineteen days- there have been no
evidences of manipulation, contrary to
speculative proverbs that "the market
only advances on manipulations; its nat
ural course is downward." It has been
the most remarkable rise in the history of
the exchange.
"Pyramlders" have had everything
their own way because there has scarcely
been a setback since the market crossed
70c. No failures have resulted. There
was an extraordinary short interest at
the beginning of the advance, and this
was hastily covered. Foreigners had
headed against considerable cash stuff in
this market, but of course this entailed
no financial loss.
Stories of big winnings are thick about
the exchange, and no such wave of pros
perity has visited the commission men in
a decade.
Causes for this advance in the price of
the "staff of life" are found in the
parched spring wheat fields of the
great Northwest, where, authorities
declare, not one-third of the crop
of former years will be harvested.
A bumper winter crop has already
been assured, outside of the States
of Ohio. Indiana and Michigan. For the
satisfaction of those who may be in fear
of starvation it may be stated also that
the visible supply of wheat in the public
granaries of the United States exceeds
45,000,000 bushels. These are the grains of
comfort left to the bears, who also have
the assurance that every month in the
year records a wheat harvest In some
country of the globe.
But at present a sort of "bull fever" is
running high, and the Chicago wheat pit
is flooded by telegraphic orders from
every part of the world to ".buy, buy,
buy." Â¦ Â¦ _ :
Bt^rs Given a Twist.
NEW YORK. June 23.â Just to show
that they still had plenty of energy and
power left, bull operators in wheat gave
their opponents a twist to-day, exceeding
In rensational features anything yet pro
duced in the prestnt campaign. Taken
completely unawares, because of yester
dav's drop from top points, the bears were
panic-stricken this morning on finding
English cablos 2 1 i'fr3MÂ»d higher and an ad
vance at Budapesth of 45 points since last
night. In large numbers they plunged
Into the market as the gong struck and
began a frantic and excited effort to re
place their sales. The result was an im
mediate lump to 90% for July, compared
with SSc last night. After a little hesita
tion, during which a lot of long wheat
came out, the screws were moved again
and July shot up to 93%c with hardly a
stop, representing a 5% rise for the day
ami about 22c in the last three weeks. This
means to the public a rise of $1 to $1 25 per
barrel In the price of flour. Toward 12
o'clock wheat suddenly declined again,
reaching 91?sC on the midday curb under
renewed heavy realizing.
WICHITA, fcans., June 23.â Kansas and
Oklahoma wheat growers are talking of
forming an organization by which they
may handle the large crops harvested and
get the highest possible price for their
output. . Â¦

Expresses Confidence That Kentucky
and California Will Be Taken
Out of the Doubtful
PITTSBURG, June 23.â Senator Mark
Hanna was in the city for a short time
to-day en route from Philadelphia to
Cleveland and talked at length on the
plans of the campaign:
"I have been assailed on every hand by
the . question as to what States we will
win over from the Democrats," said the
Ohio Senator, "and we would like to tell
the newspapers and would like to have
them tell everybody in the country who
Is Interested in the campaign that the
grand old party this year will go after Us
opponents wherever they are found. No
stronger ticket was ever placed in the
field. I would not like to predict the ma
jority that will go to McKinley and Roose
velt, and I have not heard of General
Grosvencr having made any forecasts as
to the results of this campaign. However,
we will carry Kentucky, Goebel law or no
GoebeJ law. California will vindicate
Itself. Up in the Northwest the Repub
licans will have no difficulty in holding
sway. There ls no doubt as to the turn
things will take in the East."
Asked as to his opinion of the result of
the fight in Nebraska, the Senator replied:
"We will try hard to keep Bryan's State
In the righteous column, too."
Senator Hanna said that very little
would be done for several weeks. About
August 1 the issues of the campaign
would be clearly defined and the national
managers would then be ready to co-op
erate with the committees in the various
States.
"September 1 will see the red fire burn
ing and all the drums will be beating be
fore a fortnight later." was the Senator's
comment when questioned regarding the
time of the opening of the campaign.
Few Speeches by McKinley.
CLEVELAND, June 23.â Senator Hanna
arrived home at noon to-day from Phila
delphia. He was driven directly from the
station to his office in the Perry-Payne
building, where he spent a half hour look
ing over his mail and attending to busi
ness affairs. Mr. Hanna said he was well
pleased with the ticket nominated at
Philadelphia and predicted the election of
McKinley and Roosevelt by an over
whelming majority. He denied emphati
cally that he had been compelled to make
terms with Messrs. Platt Â»nd Quay, and
added that if there had been any fight
won it resulted in his favor. He felt san
guine, he said, that New York would be
carried by the Republicans in the coming
Presidential election. He said that Presi
dent McKinley would make no speeches
during the campaign, except perhaps a
few brief talks to visiting delegations at
his home in Canton, where the chief ex
ecutive would spend his vacation. Gover
nor Roosevelt, the Senator said, would
probably take the stump during the cam
paign and deliver a number of speeches.
Mr. Hanna said he expected to remain
in Cleveland for about a month. He had
not decided as yet whether the meeting
of the National Executive Committee
would be held in Cleveland or New York.
Colonel Bryan's Views.
MILWAUKEE, WISl, June 23.â Colonel
William J. Bryan, while en route to Chi
cago from his outing trip in Wisconsin,
said to-day that all stories to the effect
that there had been any differences be
tween himself and Chairman Jones of the
Democratic National Committee were ab
solutely without foundation. Asked his
opinion of the Philadelphia platform.
Colonel Rryan said:
"The Philadelphia platform is the best
evidence thus far given of the deception
attempted by the Republican party. Taken
in connection with the speeches made at
the convention, it shows that the Repub
lican party's platform of 1S95 was a delib
erate fraud as far as the promises of in
ternational bimetallism were concerned;
that the party's attitude on the trust ques
tion is insincere, and that the party is not
willing to state its attitude on the Philip
pine qusetion and invite the judgment of
the people. Nothing was more manifest
in the convention than the military spirit,
and yet the convention did not dare in
dorse the demand'of the President in 1833
for a standing army of 100,000 men."
Colorado Invites Roosevelt.
CHICAGO. June 23.â The Colorado dele
gation to the Republican National Con
vention, which arrived from Philadelphia
this mornljig, sent a telegram to Governor
Roosevelt inviting him to visit Colorado
on his "Western Oklahoma trip in July, or
other date to suit his convenience, and
adding:
"We, promise you the largest and most
enthusiastic reception on behalf of the
people of our State ever held In the
Rocky Mountain region. In the interest
of Republican success in the Great West
we urge upon you the importance of your
acceptance."
Hill for Vice President
FRANKFORT. Ky.. June 23.â David B.
Hill ls believed here to be the choice for
Vice President of a majority of delegates
from this State to the Democratic Na
tional Convention. Insurance Commis
sioner John C. Chenault, who will go to
Kansas City with the proxy of Judpe "W.
S. Pryor as a delegate from the State at
large, said to-day:
"I am for Hill, and although there has
been no conference of the Kentucky dele
gates, I have little doubt that he will re
ceive Kentucky's vote. A canvass of the
State officials and political leaders at the
State capital shows a decided preference
for Hill for second place."
Roosevelt in Seclusion.
NEW YORK, June 23.â Governor Roose
velt Is keeping himself secluded In hl3
home at Core Neck, near Oyster Bay,
L. I. He refused to see callers to-day.
He is overwhelmed with telegrams con
gratulating him on his nomination to the
Vice Presidency. All persons whp wish
to see him during the next few days will
have to make appointments In advance.

We read in two of the big mornlns
papers of San Francisco, and indeed in
one of the news dispatches of the third,
that the most extraordinary scenes of
enthusiasm followed the nominating
speeches at Philadelphia, but it remained
for Creelman. in another part of the last
one, to say that "indifference marked the
proceedings during the nominations," and
that the convention was "a great failure
from the standpoint of party enthusiasm
and disappointing to leaders. Every man
and every woman who was present will
bear witness that the audience had to be
beoud to olÂ»Â»Â» Â»i)Â» name of . McKinley."

By the gmu circle the distance to Yoko

1490 miles, thence to Manila 62S miles;
total 6654 miles. By the trade chart San

AFFECT AND EFFECTâ F. W., City.
Affect and effect are not synonymous. To
affect is to influence: to concern. To ef
fect is to accomplish: to bring about. For
Instance, a cold affects the body, a medi
cine may effect a cure. â¢â¢"Will not affect
the most delicate physique," when applied
to a medicine to be taken Internally, is
not 03 gocd -as "will not affect the most
delicate organism."

KINYOUNISM 0ND CHINATOWN.
T~) EFORE we forget Kinyounism let us profit by
\\ the lesson it teaches. There would have been no
â^ Kinyoun quarantine had there been no foulness
in Chinatown. Had the sanitary regulations of the city
been enforced there the people of other cities would
never have been suspicious of San Francisco and
the plague talk would have had no more effect upon
the minds of people abroad than it has had upon the
minds of those at home. Out of the filthy condition
of Chinatown has come what little excuse Kinyoun's
quarantine has had, and so long as that quarter re
mains in such condition so long will it be an excuse
for similar quarantines in future.
The enforcement of the sanitary laws of tbe city in
Chinatown is an imperative duty of the municipal au
thorities. Owners of property in other quarters of
the city are required to keep their property in good
condition and in accord with the health laws. Why
should the owners of property in Chinatown be ex
empt from a similar requirement?
Chinatown is in the very heart of the city. It lies
between the aristocratic district on California Hill and
the great avenues of trade along Kearny and Mont
gomery streets. It is therefore a locality in which the
health ordinances should be enforced with the ut
most care and firmness, and yet nothing has been
done or is being done to make it a decent part of a
civilized community.
It is the duty of Mayor Phelan. to remove his in
competent bubonic Board of Health and appoint in
the place of it, a new board composed of men who
will enforce the health laws of the city and compel
the owners of property in Chinatown to obey the or
dinances. Let us get some good out of the experience
we have had with Kinyoun. 'Let us have Chinatown
cleaned up at once and' cleaned up thoroughly.
It is said that the Democratic party in New Eng
land has lost about every man of high character it
had,-and, while the report may be true, it is not likely
the country will note much diminution of the voting
MuMnath of the party in that section on election day.
THE OPEN DOOR TREATIES.
OUR British cousins are so fearful of Russian
diplomacy they will not trust it even when the
United States has a share in it. Thus while
we have '"been congratulating ourselves and the world
upon the success of the efforts of Secretary Hay to
obtain the consent of all the great powers to the
maintenance of the open door in China, some British
authorities have permitted their fears to persuade
them that our Government has been deceived, and
that the Russians have not promised, half so much
as we have thought they promised.
The ideas of these alarmists have been expressed in
the National Review for June, partly by the editor
and partly by Robert Yerburgh, who contributes an
elaborate paper on the subject. The argument is
sufficiently curious to be worth noting, and is ren
dered the more interesting by the crisis which now
threatens to precipitate the partition of the Chinese
empire, and thus put to immediate proof the value of
the concessions which Secretary Hay obtained from
Count Mouravieff.
The declarations we sought from the powers are
that no power will interfere with any treaty port, or
any vested interest within any so-called "sphere of
interest," or leased territory, it may have in Chinaâ
that the Chinese treaty tariff of the time being shall
apply to all merchandise shipped to all such ports as
are within such sphere of interest, no matter .to what
nationality it may belong, and that dutie^ so levied
shall be collected by the Chinese Government â that it
shall levy no higher harbor dues on vessels of another
nationality than on its own, and no higher railroad
charges over lines operated within its sphere.
In replying to the request for Russia's agreement to
these declarations Count MouraviefT said: "In so far
as the territory leastfd by China to Russia is concerned
the imperial Government has already demonstrated
its firm intention to follow the policy of the open door
by creating Dalny (Talienwan) a free port; and if
at some future time that port, although remaining
free itself, should be separated by a customs limit
from other portions of the territory in question, the
customs duties would be.levicd in the zone subject to
the tariff upon all foreign merchants, without dis
tinction as to nationality."
It is claimed by the National Review that in tfie
letter the Russian does not agree to the declaration
that the customs shall be those established Jsy tariff
treaties with China and collected by China, nor to
that guaranteeing equal railroad rates.- Furthermore,
il is said the statement that the tariff in the Rus
sian zone of influence shall be equal upon all "foreign
merchants" is capable of a double construction.' It
is regarded here as meaning that the country is Chi
nese and that Russians as well as Americans are "for
eigners"; but it may be held that the country is Rus
sian, and therefore Russian merchants v would not be
subject to the tariffs imposed upon foreigners.
The discovery has all the marks of a marc's nest,'
but the writer for the National Review is quite
wrouorht uo over it He says: "The -battle for the
A clean Chinatown and a new Board of Health are
things we need, and there is no reason to believe they
would come high if the people insist on them.
REPUBLICAN ENROLLMENTS.
TH; ICROLLMENT of members of Republican
clubs ia the various Assembly districts of San
1 * Francisco began yesterday and will continus
until the evening cf Saturday, June 30. It is desir
able that all Republicans should sign the rolls and
take an active part in the orgmization of the clubs.
To that desire it is the duty of all good citizens who
i>e!or.g to the Republican party to respond, for in no
other xvaj- can it be assured that the clubs will rightly
represent the genuine Republicanism of th^ best ele
ments of the city.
Xo urgent appeal to intelligent Republicans on this
issue should be needed, and yet so engrossing are the
affairs of business, or the plans for summer holidays,
that it is certain many will neglect this important pub
lic duty, unless a direct appeal be made to them. To
lhat end every earnest and zealous Republican should
devote zt this time a portion of his energies. Let
.each or.e of them act as an agent to call the attention
cf Republicans of his acquaintance to the enrollment
â¢now going on, and to present to them the reasons
why each and all should join a club and assist in its
organization.
It is certain that all the bosses or would-be bosses,
,211 the evil elements that hope to make a personal
â¢profit in politics by attaching themselves to the Re
ytibHcan party, will be prompt to get their foliower3
jenrolled, r.or will they be at all scrupulous as to the
Â«ort of men they get into their following. Thus there
â¢is danger that a considerable number of clubs will fall
rXLr.dcT the control of persons whose power will be j
weakness rather ttian a help to the party in the cam

ganger â good citizens must do their duty; loyal Re
publicans must take up the work of the campaign at
once and by enrolling themselves be able to organize
â¢the clubs in their districts and elect the officers.
Once mere a Presidential election is to turn upon
Jjusiness issues. It is again a question of preserving
commercial, industrial and financial prosperity that is
presented to the people. It is so understood every
rfwhere, and even among the men who supported
-Â¦Bryan four years ago there are now many who will
5iot only vote the Republican ticket on election day
i>nt will aid it during the campaign, because they
Jcnow thnt upon the election of McKinley and Roose
velt is dependent the welfare of the country. Since
Â¦these converts from Bryanism are to be active in the
Â¦fight for prosperity, wh2t excuse can stanch Repub
licans have for neglecting their duty?
An illustration of the earnestness with which some
of the former Eryanites and free silver men are now
co-operating with the Republicans was furnished in
â¢the news of yesterday, to the effect that three wealthy
men of Utah have contributed $150,000 to the Na
tional Committee for the Republican campaign fund.
Tlie three men are Heber M. Wells of Ogden,
Kearns of Park City and Charles E. Loose
iof Provo. Four years ago they were ultra-silver men
and contributed $25,000 each to the Bryanites, but
this year they are- for McKinley and Roosevelt, and,
according to the statement of one of them, have made
their I^rge contributions to the Republican fund "by
v/ay of atonement."
If new converts to Republicanism show such zeal,
surely the business men who have been the strength
of the party all along ought to be willing to take their
part of the political work of the year. In San Fran
"cipco the work that is to be done now is the organi
zation of the district clubs. All good Republicans
should enroll themselves. If by any evil chance the
bosses nnd their gangs get control of any number of
the clubs the men of the party who neglected their
duty will have none but themselves to blame.
It is a safe prediction that the nations will find it
a good deal easier to get into China than to get out;
end, moreover, they sre going in harmoniously, but
they wiil hardly come out that way.
When we have firmly established civilization and
order in China it might be worth while to try what
W. can do in St. Louis and Kentucky.

injury goes without saying, but must they necessarily wipe out
of existence a field of enterprise which is the most promising
in the world for our people? Ar.d must we stand idly by while
the process goes on?
The Empress ruled China from 1S61 to 1SS9. She had built
up the difficult edifice of foreign intercourse. She left her coun
try at peace with the whole world. She was reverenced by her
own people and respected by foreigners. It Is hard to believe
that all this honorable regard has been forfeited.
The reign of the Empress Regent was noticeable for a
marked and general- progress In a number of different direc
tions, especially commercial. Railroads did not until recently
win their way, but the foundation was laid for them. The usa
of the electric telegraph became general.
The secret societies in China have been heretofore chiefly
Influenced by antagonism to the Manchus. They have favored
the restoration of the Ching dynastyâ which was Chinese. In
order to embarrass the Government they have attacked for
eigners and native Christians, -who, under the treaties, are en
titled to protection.
There were occasional anti-foreign riots. Riots and dis
turbances are not unusual in our ewn country. China paid
compensatory damages in every case of injury to person or
property.
It would seem from some of the reports from China that
the secret societies have taken up the cause of the Emperor.
This Is almost a self-evident contradiction. The quarrel with,
the Empress on the part of the foreigner Is that she la anti
foreign and that she Is secluding the Emperor, who is In favpr
of the foreigners. There can be no reason, therefore, why thÂ©
secret societies should take up his cause.
At the bottom of all these popular uprisings Is discontent
growing out of deluges and starvation caused by short crops.
There Is a great deal of misery and poverty in China.
The editor of the World's Editorial Forum has asked my
opinion of "the real meaning and probable outcome" of thÂ» ex
isting riots. Judging by my experience in China from 1SS5 to
1S9S I would say that the riots would be put down by the Gov
ernment, as hundreds have been put down heretofore, but new
elements have entered into the situation. It was not until 1S97.
when Germany landed a battalion of marines and seized a por
tion of the province of Shantung, that "It came to be believed
that China had no rights that Europeans were bound to re
soect. Since then three other nations have helped themselves
to her territory, and no objection has been raised anywhere ia
the world. In some quarters the Idea seems to prevail that the
human race would be benefited by destroying the autonomy
of China and dividing her soil up among more advanced na-
Tnis plea thinly veils the greed for conquest and domination.
Left to herself, China will work out, as Japan has done, her
own salvation. Ruled by monarchies and despots, her land will
always be the abode of abject misery and want.
Let the people who wish well to China frown upon the es
tablishment of a protectorate. It is the beginning of~B.bs.orp-
My Judgment Is that the Boxers will be put down and that
before long peace will prevail in China, and that partition will
not be attempted at this time.
THE BILLBOARD ORDINANCE.
1 I OR many a year the American people have had
J a jeer significant of contempt for the kind of
*Â¦ politicians who "are in favor of the law, but agin
its enforcement." The cause of the sentiment is the
frequency with which that sort of dodging is prac
ticed by a certain type of officials. It is to be hoped
none of the Supervisors will expose himself to sus
picion of belonging to the type. Such suspicions,
however, are likely to be aroused should the Super
visors pass an ordinance but postpone its enforcement
for a year to come, and that is what some of them at
least seem inclined to do in dealing with the billboard
nuisance.
The passage of an ordinance restricting advertising
fences to a height not exceeding ten feet, but declaring
the restriction shall not be enforced until July, 1901,
will be of no benefit to the city nor of any credit to the
Supervisors. During the year in which the ordinance
is to be inert and ineffective the men who derive a
profit by the high fence nuisance will have time to
devise ways and means for evading it, postponing its
operation or de/eating it altogether. It is probable
that when put into operation suit will be brought to
test its validity. settlement of that suit will re
quire considerable time, and it cannot be begun until
the ordinance is in force. Thus if the ordinance
carry a clause putting off the enforcement for a year,
the date at which the people may expect relief from
the ugly and dangerous nuisance of high fences will
be very distant. <.
The Supervisors can hardly expect to be able to fool
the public on a matter of this kind. They will not de
ceive anybody by passing an ordinance restricting the
nuisance after a year from July. The demand is for
a restriction of the nuisance now. The Supervisors
will either give relief or they will not, and an un
enforced ordinance gives no relief. That is the plain
statement of the situation, and the people so under
stand it. When the ordinance comes before the board
for final passage those Supervisors who desire to re-
Strict if not altogether suppress this nuisance, against
which the/public in every American city have been
protesting for years, will strike out the clause which
postpones to July I, 1901, the time when it is to go
into effect.

THE JUBILEE CELEBRATION.
/^ RAND MARSHAL COSTELLO has issued a
I ""I circular directing the attention of the people
â generally to the arrangements now being
made by the Native Sons to fitly celebrate the semi
centennial of the admission of California to the
Union, and calling upon all to cordially assist in the
work and in the festival. After pointing out that the
various parlors of the order have appointed a joint
committee and perfected arrangements for making
the celebration the grandest in our history, the cir
cular says; "It is not our desire, however, and the
Native Sons of the Golden West do not claim the
right, to monopolize the celebration of this great
event. It is our ardent wish that all citizens and resi
dents of the State of California, both native and
adopted, should unite and co-operate with us in
making the forthcoming celebration of Admission
day the most memorable that California has ever
known, a celebration worthy in every way of such a
historical occasion. We therefore ask the assistance
and co-operation of all organizations, fraternal and
otherwise, in this city and State, to aid us in our en
deavor." s
It is to be hoped this invitation will meet with a
cordial and universal response. The summer and the
fall are'to be stormy with political agitations and dis
cussions. There will be a strain of partisan contention
upon the people for months to come. It will be well,
therefore, for all to have an interlude of common pa
triotism to break the continuity of campaign speeches.
The date of Admission day falls at the right time for
such an interlude. It comes after all the struggles
over the nominations have been made and just before
the stump speaking and the campaigning begins in
earnest. It is therefore just the right season for Re
publicans, Democrats, Populists, Prohibitionists and
Independents to meet together in a general feeling of
pride and loyalty to the State and to the Union, and
make an Admission day festival that will be a thing
to remember and to talk of for years to come.
The plans for the celebration can be easily arranged
so as to give every important organization or associa
tion in the State a fair field and opportunity for taking
part in the festival. There is, however, but little time
for preparation, and those who intend to share in the
work should, in the language of the street, get a move
on. The Native Sons have in their ardor designed to
make the celebration the grandest in our history; let
all join in and help them to make it so.
THE OflKLflND CASE
THE suit brotight by the Contra Costa Water
Company against the city of Oakland to obtain
a judgment establishing the value of its plant
and the measure of income to be received upon. that
valuation is one of unusual interest and importance.
People who have thus far watched the proceedings
have waited with great curiosity and anxiety for the
outcome of the objections raised to the Judge who has
been acting in this case. It is a question whether
such a proceeding would likely occur in any part of
the country outside of this State, and it demands
grave inquiry and consideration. While the objection
to his sitting in the case was couched in the usual
diplomatic language of the legal profession, protesting
that no reflection was intended upon the character or
integrity of his "Honor," the ordinary layman will
fail to see why the objection was made at all if there
was not underlying it a suspicion of something wrong.
Unless it was a wanion attack, the objection plainly
carried the intimation that the city of Oakland did
not believe it could obtain a fair hearing and decision
from this particular Judge, and the matter should not
be permitted to rest there. If the courts are to be of
any value they must be above suspicion, and no class
of men is so much interested in keeping them in high
repute as the lawyers themselves, for without confi
dence in the courts people will shun them as they
would a pesthouse, and the practice of the law must
degenerate in consequence to the level of licensed
pillage and blackmail. No country can be great or
enjoy a high degree of prosperity in any way unless
it has a system of jurisprudence in which its people
believe and trust.
President Diaz of the republic of Mexico, who is
one of the greatest statesmen of this age, early gave
evidence of his wisdom by reforming the courts of
that country and taking stringent 'measures for the
impartial enforcement of the laws, with the result that
the credit of the nation was re-established in all civil
ized countries and foreign capital was freely attracted
to the development of its resources. Why has the bar
of this State remained silent since this attack upon
one of the judiciary? In former days, when the rules.
of chivalry obtained in the Southern States, every
lawyer stood ready to defend the honor of the Judges
before whom he practiced, and if one of them was in
sulted the lawyers of his bailiwick would draw lots to
determine who of their number should challenge the
insulter to mortal combat, because the Judge, on ac
count of his position, could not defend himself. Why
has there been no demonstration to protect the Judge
in this case? There can be but one of two answers:
Either the bar of California generally has become de
generate and indifferent to the high prerogatives and
obligations to it belonging, or its members do not
consider that the character and standing of this par
ticular Judge are such as to command their interfer
ence. It is due to the general public that this question
be determined, because if an innocent man has been
unjustly assailed while occupying a position which
ties his hands from defense, and is forsaken by his
natural defenders, then the business men of the com
munity who are interested in the good name of the
State should step forward to his defense. It will be
the aim of The Call to follow the proceedings in this
case closely and keep its readers advised of the facts.
There has already been too much scandal in this State
about the fixing of water rates and the buying of Su
pervisors and other like bodies in connection there
with. We hope the odor of this filth and corruption
will not taint the good name or contaminate the
robes of the judiciary, and that no member of the
bench will be unjustly suspected. On the other hand,
the people should not be blamed for entertaining sus
picions, for it is a matter of public notoriety and his
tory that in many instances in the making of rates the
public has been defrauded and betrayed by the gross
est treachery and corruption, and it becomes the rate
payers to be vigilant against repetitions of such prac
tices.
Â«
DURING the nine months which
have elapsed since Mr. Henry
Miller left us we have had about
one month of rational theatrical
entertainment in San Francisco
and eight months of desolation.
His return, always welcome, will this
time be doubly so, ar.d his endeavors to
bring back to the theater a class of peo
ple who have been forced to prefer a good
book at home will be crowned, I trust,
with the high success they deserve. It Is
surely not unfitting to pleaG for one the
ater in a city as large as San Francisco
where the best plays procurable may be
interpreted in the best manner. The city
has plenty of cheap houses, where farce,
burlesque, melodrama and "comic" opera
are served up at moderate prices all the
year round, to the evident enjoyment of
people. who enjoy that kind of thing. But
such "entertainments" do nothing to ad
vance the drama as a fine art and have
absolutely no interest for people who have
read good plays and who have seen really
fine acting.
To make his season a success Mr. Miller
must find in j San Francisco about 10.000
people each week who really want to see
the best that is a-going and are willing to
pay for it. That means about 2% per cent
of our population â not a very large pro
portion, surely.

Mr. Miller promises us this time Dumas'
"A Marriage of Convenience." Good!
Good also is It to hear that we are to
have "The Only Way," for if Dickens is
to live by anything more than "David
Copper-field" It will be by the pathos and
the dramatic power of "A Tale of Two
Cities." But what has become of "Tre
lawney of the Wells," which was prom
ised in the earlier announcements, but is
not mentioned in the most recent? That
is a better play than any on Mr. Miller's
list, with the exception of the two men
tioned. It is in Pinero f s very best style
and contains a character sketch of Tom
Robertson that is of great historical in
terest. Let us hope that "Trelawney"
will be forthcoming.

From New York comes the gratifying
intelligence that the fund for the actors'
home has reached the respectable sum of
$66,000. This result is due chiefly to Mr.
Al Hayman, who subscribed $10,000; to Mr.
Harrison Grey Fisko of the Mirror, whose
exertions for all things that tend to better
the profession are untiring, and to the
management of the New York Herald.
Among the subscriptions it is pleasant to
notice one of $100 from Sarah Bernhardt,
$500 from the Roman Catholic Orphan
Asylum and $1250 from the New York Fire
Department. Come, now, boys of the San
Francisco Fire Department; where are
you on this? Here's a chance to show
that you are as good friends of the actor
as are the boys in New York. The shelter
of the actors' home is deep as a well and

The opening dialogue of this play is
thoroughly characteristic of Maeterlinck.

Alas, poor Belgium! Is thl3 your Shake

gross libel on the intelligence of blind peo

"The very mode of expression In op
eratic art is false and the -whole of it is
unreal and untrue." Who says this, 1
wonder? Is it seme jealous playwright or
some composer of symphonies? No, it is
Madame Calve, the finest operatic singer
of the day, who is going to abandon
opera for drama. ! Soul of departed Wag
ner, can you hear this from any sphere,
however remote, and not return to con
found the heretic?
Madame Calve merely proclaims what
many people who are bored by opera feel,
but have not the courage to express. They
are bored because, not being musical en
thusiasts who can overlook all absurdities
provided song be there, they find it im
possible to believe for a moment that any
think taking place on the stage is like
anything in real life. And they are right.
The drama asks us to grant conventions
enough, but none that are palpably in
credible; opera demands that we grant
conventions which are palpably incredible.
For instance, how can I be for a moment
illusionized by a tenore robusto who runs
I up and down the scale of linked sweetness
long drawn out In mellifluous attempt to
say to his lady love, "Madame, walk this
way and I will open the door"? As
Madame Calve says, the very mode of ex
pression is false, unreal, untrue; it is like
nothing in the heavens above or the earth
beneath or the waters under the earth.

The republication in attractive book
form (Sergei, Chicago) of three of Maeter
linck's plays has led me again to look over
the works of morbid, melancholy. Maurice,
and again to wonder at the Judgment of
those who hail the recluse of Ghent a3 the
Belgian Shakespeare. Surely, never be
fore this fin-de-slecle period did a poet at
tain European reputation with such a nar
row range of ideas, such poverty of imag
ery, such monotony of expression! To
read Maeterlinck one would think that we
were still living In the fourteenth cen
tury, when men childishly believed that
the problem of the universe was solvable
and that by much prying we could man
age to peep through the veil that shuts off
the unknowable from the knowable. â¢ * â¢
True, also, we are but innnitesimally small
puppets dancing upon this sand speck of
a world in an cbscure corner of an unim
portant collection of asteroids, which we
dignify by the came of the solar system,
but this depressing fact cannot and must
not be continually harked back to by any
one who expects to get anything out of
life, least of all by a poet, whose duty it
Is to beautify, to elevate, to cheer, to con
sole. Now,' Maeterlinck seldom beautifies,
elevates, cheers or consoles; on the con
trary, he too often prefers the ugly, the
depressing, the gloomy, the morbid. What
open door has been fought; the public believe it has
been won; the public has rejoiced with exceeding
great joy. . As a matter of fact the battle has. been
lost, and we are to-day as far from an agreement with
regard to the open door as we were before the United
States entered the arena as its champion."

The poolroom men. according to Chief
Sullivan, consented Friday not to sell
pools till the cases were decided, but he
received information yesterday that pools
were being sold In Corbett's and Crow

licemen Proll and Larkin were detailed
to visit the poolrooms, and they succeed

J. W. Breen of San Bernardino has ap
plied for letters of guardianship over the
person and estate of I/awrence O'Brien,
who lives at 46 Jessie street. Not long ago,
Breen alleges, O'Brien, who is aged and
partially paralyzed, came Into possession
of a few thousand dollars. On the eve
of the celebration he held in honor of his
good fortune he met Mrs. Ellen MeManus
and notwithstanding his physical condi
tion they were married. Breen says
O'Brien is lying helpless and in a dying
condition at, his humble home uncared for
by his wife. He asks for letters of guard
ta'nshlp In consequence that he may make
the old man's last days comfortable and
get possession of his money for that pur
pose. Â¦-<;":;â¢.

For mere than a century the Mexicans
cf Los Angeles have been using asphalt
urn, taken from the Brea ranch, west of
that city, with which to roof their houses.
Br<->a is another name for asphaltum. the
existence o f this material has been a mat
ter of common knowledge. Nevertheless
thi5 pointer for the oil prospectors was
overlooked by them during the period ot
oil ppe<-jlation until very recently. OH
was scooped from ehallow holes on the
Maltman ranch, near the Baptirt College,
for years, yet no rystematic attempt was
made at development there until the past
few months. Now the people in Los An
geles are wondering over these two queer
tactd and the Ixis Angrles Times says that
â¢â¢the average oil expert appears to be
cfraid of oil on the surface. He would
rathrr go aft*r it with a witchhazel rod."
Two new oil refineries are projected.
One ifi for Bakerpfleld and the other for
Eummerland. That at Bakersfleld will be
erected by the Hercules Oil Company.
The plant will occupy ten acres and will
have a dally capacity of 1000 barrels. It
will be finished In about six months. The
refinery at Summerland will, according Uj
local advices, be under way within three
months. The good price to be obtained
*or the by-products and the low price for
unrefined petroleum have made the Sum
merland people believe that a refinery
would be profitable.

The Reed Company'* pale has been made.
The transfer was effected on a basis of 11,800,
0Â«0, and the property acquired by the new own
ers consist* of 1200 acres of approved ground,
together with problematical land amounting to
about 400 acres. The deal was practically a
reorganization, as the members of the original
company retain stork In the present one,
which Is called the Reed Crude OH Company.
Its board of directors consist of the following:
j F Sartnrt. William C. Kerckhoff. Henderson
Havward W. D. Woolwine, W. H. Perry, Went
Huirhes, Kaspare Cohn, T. L. Reed and T. S.
Fuller. Mr. Kerckhoft is president. Mr.

and Mr. Fuller secretary. There Is UOO.
ooo in the treasury. It Is itated that the
developments now under way will proceed
at if no change had taken place, but with the
addition of lanre storage tanks on the railroad
branch and probably a water pipe line system
covering thÂ« wholt or a part ot the land, flu-
The following statements are made by
the Bakersfield Callfornlan concerning the
pale of the Reed Oil Company's proper
ties:
The oil prospectors are now very busy
in Orange County. One hundred business
men of Santa Ana have paid into the
treasury of the New Lacuna Oil Company
of that place $50 each and have received
f>000 shares of stock of the par value of
$1 per share, and the first well will be
sunk with that money. The company has
leased 640 acres on the San Joaquln ranch,
near the ocean. Two other leases of land
have just been put on record in Orange
County. One of these was* of 140 acres,
adjoining 1 the mountain home of Mme.
Modjeska. The other is of 130 acres by
the Kern River Oil and Development Com
pany of San Francisco. There are no pro
ducing wells near these tracts.
The San Diego Union reports that "the
prediction is freely made that within
three weeks San Diego will see the big
gest oil excitement that has been known
in the State, where there have been many
oil excitements." The basis for this is
not given, but there is not a section where
prospecting is under way- that has not
been similarly enthusiastic. Here are
some of the oil enteroiises now In San
Diogo County: Monarch Oil Company,
down 20ft feet and working night and day;
Victoria Oil Company, to prospect at En
cinitas; San Jacinto Company, to bore at
Moreno; Oceanslde and San Luis Rey Oil
and Land Company, to acquire lands and
have them prospected for petroleum.
Others have previously been mentioned.
precincts of the Los Angeles OH Exchange
were invaded by "wildcat," or non-djvi
o>nd paying oil stocks, the sales of the
two classes of securities compared as
follows: lasted stocks, 3700 shares,
amount $1SS5; "wildcats," 8600 shares,
amount $309 25. On the same day the Cal
ifornia Exchange sold 11,750 shares in
"wildcats" for $1M5 HO. in addition to 3125
dividend sharps for $1S.W.
According to a dispatch from San
Diego, Captain J. J. Meyler. Government
engineer in that district, has expressed
the opinion that none of the oil claims
filed on the sea coast. In the absence of
a permit from the war Department, Is
legal. To bore a well in the ocean it is
necessary' to build a wharft Applications
for permission to build ' wharves have
been made and all such have been re
ferred to Captain Meyler to Investigate).
The prospectors for oil in the ocean axÂ»
la suspense In tho meantime.
When the Southern Pacific spur to the Kern
River field Is completed, and the railroad .eays
It will be done In sixty days, there Is going to
be a flood of oil put on the market, and nn
extensive revision In the production Ktatigtlcs
of the State will be In order. A tour of the
field mentioned shows hundreds of new derricks
up waiting for a rig. Nenrly all the older com
panies have quantities of oil stored tanging
from 500 to 2600 barrels, but they have found
that storage tanks are costly and they argue
that the oil Is as safe where it has lain for
centuries as it would be pumped, and therefore
pumping is delayed until transportation Is as
sured. :â¢-Â¦Â¦-
A test will be made for oil on the south
side of the Kern River on what is known
as Panorama Heights, facing the river
at the big bend in the bluff. Eighty acres
have been leased by Tim Spellacy, S.
Breckenridge, James H. Wood, A. G.
Newton and H. B. Chanly. They will put
up a standard rig at once. A strike south
of the Kern River would largely extend
the district, and the operations are ac
cordingly very Interesting to the opera
tors in the Kern River Held. The owners
of the land are T. E. Harding and H. A.
Bladget.
The following Is from the Kern Countv
Echo:
Fourteen hundred acres of the Brea
ranch, near Los Angeles, were recently
leased and the owner. Mr. Hancock of
Los Angeles, received. $14,000 for the lease
and also a. cash bonus.
rerlntendent W. I. Ross will continue in
charge.
Here are some accounts cf the products
of oil wells furnished on good authority-
One well in the Fullerton district has
produced 40.000 barrels of oil during the
past year; another well in the same dis
trict. 1200 feet deep, was full to the top
with 32 gravity oil before the pump began
to stir the sand, and a well beside it
filled and overflowed the casing when a
depth of 9fiO feet had been reached by tho
drill. There are many "gushers" and
several that have the record of throwing
oil over the derrick tops. There Is a well
one mile north of Plru City that threw
oil to the top of the derrick and is pro
ducing 100 barrels of oil per day. The
Ramona Company, which taJtes its name
from Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Is
drilling on the ranch which was the scene
of the story.
The Espee Makes the $3.00 Excur
sion Bate Open for the
Fair.
The Stockton Street Fair has gained an
other big point, so far as tho bay cities
are concerned. It was originally planned
by the railroad companies that the special
$3 round trip rate should prevail for one
day only. June 20, and then only on special
tra'lns, the remaining days of the fair to
enjoy only the general Fourth of July
rate, which is $3 35.
Now the Southern Pacific announces that
tho $3. rate will be practically open for
July 1. 2. 3 and 4, tickets good on all regu
lar trains and good for return July 5 or
before. '

FRATERNAL SOCIETIES
SELECT NEW OFFICERS
The members of the Supervisors' Print
ing Committee are of the opinion that a
combine existed among certain printing
concerns who bid for the municipal print
ing for the next fiscal year. It appears
that about 1 o'clock on Monday afternoon
representatives of the firms that had sub
mitted bids discovered that bids had been
filed by James H. Barry of the Star. As
soon as the discovery was made the bids
submitted by them were hastily with
drawn, and the committee believes that
new ones were submitted before 3 o clock,
the time when all bids were to have been
filed.
While the committee does not make any
accusation that a combination existed.
Supervisors Booth and Connor consider It
strange that the bids were withdrawn im
mediately after It was ascertained that
Barry was a bidder for a considerable por
tion of the printing. The other firms
whose bids were received were Phillips &
Smyth, Commercial Publishing Company,
Stanley, Taylor & Co., H A S. Crocker &
Co.. Frank Eastman & Co., Spalding &
Co. It Is alleged that some of these firms
withdrew their bids, but It Is not known
whether the new bids they submitted con
tained lower figures than those- In the
original bids. _, .
A noteworthy fact In connection with
the award of the printing contracts is that
Barry's bids were in nearly all cases the
lowest, and he was awarded at least <0
per cent of the contracts. It Is not thought
that any official investigation will be
made, as it would be difficult to prove that
any combination existed among the nrms
who temporarily withdrew their bids.
At the meeting of the committee yester
day afternoon the bids for lithographing
certain city maps and official records were
opened, and a startling discrepancy was
disclosed in the bids of the two bidders.
H. S. Crocker & Co. on nine Items bid $215,
while ' Phillips & Smyth bid $1614. The
committee was surprised at the difference
of J1369, though they were pleased that the
city was saved that muth money on ac
count of inviting bids for the printing.
Grattan Phillips, a member of the firm,
explained his high figure by stating that
the firm would be obliged to purchase the
stones necessary for the lithographing.
They understood that H. S. Crocker al
ready had the stones, and If they had
known the fact earlier they would not
have bid on the contract.
Certain Film* Withdrew Their Bids
and Substituted Others After V
Bival Has Submitted His
Figures.

lieves That One Was
Agreed Upon.

Thirty men have for vfirfmis reasons

There has been a groat deal of activity
of late in Troop A of the Second Brigade.

body. Six men have been discharged from

ence to the wishes of that organization

rian who attended Mr. Goodwin says the
ector was at no time in a dangerous con

Miss Elliott were seriously alarmed and
fears were expressed for his life. He Â¦was
still in bad shape when they left this aft
ernoon for Duluth, where the company is
booked to play Monday night. Members
of the company also started a report that
Mrs. Goodwin was contemplating leaving
Mr. Goodwin.
After the performance, in order to get
tome needed rest and to quiet his nerves,
Mr. Goodwin took a dose of morphine,
but not getting the desired result a doc
tor was summoned, and he, not knowing
that morphine had already been admin

evident, and from that time until late this
morning the physician worked with the
ictor before he sucei-ded in bringing him

Several papers this week printed long
articles alleging that London is overrun
with gangs of American swindlers. Col
onel Sir Edward Bradford, the Commis-
Fioner of Police of the metropolis, said
in an interview: ';-Â¦ : â¢-Â¦
"It is absolutely untrue. I suppose
there are American swindlers, just as
there are English, German and every
other kind of swindlers. But to say that
American swindlers predominate is a libel
on one of London's class of visitors."

The most interesting theatrical news is
the engagement of Gertrude Elliott as
leading lady by Forbes Robertson for his
American tour. Miss Elliott, who came
to England a few years ago as companion
to her sister, Maxine, has made rapid
strides in her profession. The Chronicle
"She Is an almost new and certainly
delightful type of the ingenue. Her pos

or Desdemona."
American Swindlers Abroad.
Great Britain's army in South Africa is
elowlv accomplishing the work of pacifi
cation. The smoldering embers of what
was once fierce resistance occasionally
flare up, but the hard lighting seems to
be over. The military progress in the
Transvaal is scarcely more interesting
now than the events in the Orange River
Colonv during the last two months. The
Transvaal annexation proclamation is ex
pected soon.
Almost all reports Indicate that the
Boers are rapidly realizing the futility of
a further struggle when opposed to such
an overwhelming force.
One of the most noticeable features of
the week in South Africa was Lord Rob
erts' abandonment of humane measures
toward the Boers, which he had so long
persisted in despite the criticism of the
British colonists and many officers. The
stern vengeance that now will be visited
not only on those who give the Boers
passive assistance, but on those who after
surrendering fail to assist the British
arms, favors more of General Kitchener
than of "Bobs." Â¦ <â¢' ;â¢.
KumassI still awaits relief. Governor
Hodgson is expected to hold out, but even
after the siege ends little can be done to
subdue the natives until the rains are
over. In December a punitive expedition,
Â¦with a corps -of white troops, probably
will be sent. The mortality among the
officers of Colonel Willcock's staff shows
'how useless it would be to Bend many
white troops until then.
The Khedive's unfortunate Illness has
robbed London of much of the expected
festivities, and In some respects has made
the visit somewhat of a fizzle. Some such
stimulus to trade is badly needed as in
spite of the efforts of the royalties the
season is dull in the extreme.

Hard Fighting Is Over.
The death of Count iluravleft, the Rus
sian Minister of Foreign Affairs, evoked
no canting obituaries or expressions of
regret here for the British press, in spite of
equanimity of the foreign Office, was
una-nimous in realizing the gravity of the
present turn of aftairs. To quote a staid
and humane weekly, "the death of Rus
sia's Minister removes an obstacle to the
cordiality between Russia and Kngland,"
and, though this summarizes the com
ment of the leading papers, there is little
hope expressed that Russia's aggressive
policy toward China will be muen modi
ried. Apart from the material view of
the result of Count Muravieff's death, it
is generally referred to as one of the
most pathetic happenings in political ca
reers, for, according to the dead man's
critics, he seemed, owing to the crisis In
China, on the verge of accomplishing the
object to which he had devoted his iife.
Lord Loch's death, almost coinciding
with Count Muravieff's? also removes one
whose name was much connected with
matters in the Far East- Before he be
came a colonial governor, Lord Loch as
sisted In the negotiations which resulted
in the treaty of Tientsin in 1SG0, and es
caped execution at the hands of the Chi
nese empire only by fifteen minutes'
grace. Like Muravieff, he was struck
down when the dream of his lifetime
seemed about to be realized. In his case
it was British federation over the whole
of South Africa.
Lord Salisbury's entreaty this week to
the missionaries not to have themselves
murdered is one more instance of his un
common frankness, or, as it is referred to,
"his thinking aloud phase." Among the
secular press the Premier's remarks will
meet the approbation of their sound com
mon sense, but it will not add church
votes to the Conservative party at the
next general election, which, by the way,
is still further postponed on account of
the/Chinese trouble.
Muravieff Was England's Foe.
Spion Kop, Paardeburg and Colenso
sink into insignificance compared with the
spectacle presented by the land and sea
forces of the six great powers in the
world fighting side by side against a com
mon enemy. With a keen sense of the
relative proportion of things Great Brit
ain quickly turned her eyes to China, not
so much, perhaps, on immediate develop
ments as upon the possibility of tn*
epoch-making war or wars which may
arise out of the present crisis.

HIGHWAYMAN
IS FOILED BY A
PLUCKY WOMAN
Mrs; Taylor of Lodi Uses
a Whip on Her As
sailant.
Man Is Frightened Away by an. Ap-
proaching Team and -Officers Are
How Scouring the Country
for Him.
L0DI, June 23.â Mrs. Annie Taylor, a*
determined little woman, who owns large
land interests near Lodi, frustrated the
designs of a masked highwayman last
evening In a most emphatic way. , She
was driving toward home when a man
stepped out from a clump of bushes at
the roadside, seized the horse by the
bridle, and, leveling a revoler, demanded
her money at the cost of her life.
Her answer came in a number of sharp
cuts with a buggy-whip across the hign
wayxnan's face. He tenaciously clung to
the lines with one hand and with the
other attempted to drag Mrs. Taylor
from the buggy. The sound of an ap
proaching Â¦wagon and tbo lady's scneams
finally frightened the r^Ser away.
In the struggle Mrs. Taylor dropped
from her wrist Into the road a handbag
containing a purse with considerable
money. It was found where she had
dropped it at 3 o'clock this morning and
returned to her. Officers are scouring the
country for the highwayman.
Accidentally Shot Himself.
HALFMOON BAY, June 23.â George
Debenetta, son of the Supervisor, acci
dentally shot himself through the hand
with a pistol this afternoon. He will
probably lose the member.
rich In gold, and diving belle will be used
to exploit the river. All the machinery
has been ordered and will be brought from

SANTA FE BOYCOTTED
BY HANFORD CITIZENS
New Road 3>enounced for Running
Its Overland Trains via
Visalia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HANFORD, June 23.â A monster masa
meeting was held to-night to protest
against the Santa Fe running overland
trains via VlsaJla, giving Ha.nford only a
locai train. The meeting was addressed
by leading business men and shippers,
who denounced the railroad In vigorous
language and strong resolutions were
adopted against the railroad! Business
men and fruit shippers declare they will
not ship a pound of freight by or patron
ize the Valley passenger trains unless the
decision to run all overland traffic via
Visalla is rescinded. '
The meeting- was the largest and most
enthusiastic ever held here. The route
via Vlsalia is twenty-three miles farther
to San Krancisco than via Hanford and
runs through no more populous or fruit
ful country. When the Valley road was
first proposed Kings County people work,
ed hard, to secure right of way not only
through their own but in other sections,
and since the completion of the road more
freight and passengers have gone out ot
Hanford than any town In the valley ex
cepting Fresno. Now that the Valley
road has been absorbed the people here
are hot at being wiped off the map en
tirely and their large shipping and pas
senger business relegated to "jerk water"
service. This city is on the main line and
the shortest route between Mohave and
San Francisco. Its citizens are deter
mined to make a desperate effort to force
the Santa Fe to furnish adequate service
for the needs of the town.
Without Hanford the business division
from Fresno to Bakersfleld would hardly
pay expenses. The vigorous boycott
which the action of to-night's meeting
makes probable will have a good effect
within a few days. This is the busy sea
son here. Fruit and- grain crops are be
ing .handled and the amount of freight
shipped is something enormous. The
Santa Fe loses all this trade. The situa
tion is delightful to the Southern Pacific
officials, who now gather where they did
not sow.

NORTH PACIFIC COAST RAILROAD.
SThc reason for this is that there are
lectcd elements in Grape-Nuts that
furnish direct to the brain and nerve
centers the necessary particles to re-
build the delicate gray matter containei
in these parts, therefore a man continu-
ously fed. on Grape-Nuts is absolutely
certain of a good condition of the ner-
vous system, which is really the con-
troller of the entire body.
The Grape-Nuts breakfast food is es-
pecially valued by campers and frontier
people, as it is already cooked and
ready for instant service, and, being
concentrated, furnishes unusual strength
and nourishment, in a small quantity. It
is believed that a man can travel farther
and exercise more continuously on a
few teaspoons of Grape-Nuts than on
like quar.tily of any other food known.
General E. C. Machen, an old Con-
federate soldier, has just returned from
an extended trip through the South-
west and along the Mexican border,
investigating mining properties. He
says: "No matter where I traveled I
always found it possible to get Grape-
Nuts and Postum Food Coffee, of
which I am very fond."
Major Dcsborough, writing from
Fresno, Cal., says: "I found Grape-
Nuts food 45 miles in the mountains in
an old oil camp, where the whole crowd,
"lo men, eat it for breakfast every day,
and every Sunday have it in a pudding
for dinner."

CHICAGO TO ENTERTAIN
GRAND ARMY VETERANS
BANGOR.Me.,June 23.â Thirty years ago
"William \V. Thomas Jr. of Maine led a
little colony, of Swedes over the ocean
from their fatherland into the deep forests
of his native State. In the north woods
thereof he founded a Swedish settlement.
This settlement he baptised New Sweden,
a name at, once commemorative of the
past and auspicious of tho future. The
colony consisted of fifty-one souls all told,
'men, women and children. Under the su
pervision of Mr. Thomas the colonists
went to work felling trees, building log
houses, clearing land, bushing, out roads
and building bridges. Then there was busy
work in the woods of Maine. The Ameri
can forest rang with the blows of the
Swedish ax. Extensive clearings opened
out and log houses were rolled up on
every hand. Odd bits of. board and the
happily twisted branches of trees were
auickly converted into needed articles of
furniture. Rustic bedsteads, tables, chairs
and the omnipresent cradle made their
appearance in every house, and Swedish
industry and ingenuity soon transformed
the forest into the abode of man: Mr.
Thomas everywhere shared the. toils and
privations of the new settlers. Every day
he was among them. On foot or on horse
back he visited them all and every day
beheld something tangible accomplished
in the woods of Maine. After four years
of work the colony was fast rooted and
had become -self-sustaining. Bounteous
crops had been harvested everywhere, and
Mr Thomas was able then to take a fare
weil of tho colony, which has ever since
pursued a successful and independent ex
istence. Â¦ Â¦ , -,,
Thirty years have now rolled by. Since
18T(i the little colony of fifty-one has
grown to a solid community of over 2000.
The Swedes have spread out through the
woods from the mother colony of New
Sweden and. on adjacent townships have
founded the settlements of Westmanland,
-Stockholm,' Jemtland, UpsaJa-and other
small colonies. The log houses have
given way to substantial two-story frame
dwellings. Large barns stand near the
growing crops. Schoolhouses are placed
at the cross-roads. Four large, commo
dious churches have been built, and on
every Sunday morning the sound of the
church bell resounds through the forest.
All the colonists are well-to-do fanners.
Another remarkable fact Is that this col
ony is the i only successful agricultural
colony founded with foreigners from over
the ocean in the New England States since
the Revolutionary war.
The Swedish colonists of Maine will, on
Monday, celebrate the thirtieth an
niversary of the founding of the colony
with speeches and music and festivities
appropriate to the day. Mr. Thomas, now

Ship Senator Fined.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 23.â A fine
has been imposed upon the ship Senator,
now lying at Moodyville, for contraven
tion of the customs laws. The charge
brought by the department is that the
Senator made an improper entry at the
customs office upon her arrival here. It
appears that certain of the ship's stores,
consisting of some coal, were Bold to the
North Vancouver ferry steamer, the
amount involved being $25. The vessel's
manifest read only ballast and stores. The
customs authorities imposed a nne of $400.
The matter has been reported to Ottawa,
The offense is not one. that could include
the seizing of the ship, so that the report
Etating that the vessel had been taken in
charge is Incorrect.

Agree to Surrender Thirty Per Cent
of Their Claims Against the
Sail of Justice.
The merchant creditors of Bateman
Brcs., who held the original contract for
building the Hall of Justice and Morgue,
held a meeting- in the Mills building- yes
terday and agreed to sign a release of
about 20 per cent of their claims against
the firm. The.Â«o claims amount to $73,
244 22, and were for material and labor
furnished in erecting the structure. It
row remains for Bateman Bros, to Rive a
clean re-ccipt and the last obstacle in the
way of accepting the building by the city
wfll have been removed and there will be
no reason why the building in the con
struction of which there .have been so
many vexatious delays should not be oc
cupied ln the near future. The latest de
lay was caused by the Auditor holding up
all demands on the fund because of liens
filed apainst It by thirty merchants, who
have now agTeed to a compromise. There
Is now in the fund the sum of $(34,223 50
which will be applied to paying off their
claims. Some of these creditors favored
the plan of Bateman Bros, bringing a suit
against the city for $30,0130 for extras fur
nished, but they were deterred owing to
the probability of a lengthy lawsufl, with
the chance of an unfavorable decision.
BATEMANS' CREDITORS
SIGN A COMPROMISE
Captain Henderson of the British ship
Largo Law, which arrived from Japan in
ballast last Friday night, has been
through experiences that few men ashore
or afloat have ever survived. He has
be<Â»n shipwrecked half a dozen times, has
had several encounters with icebergs off
the Horn, fought fires on board ship in
both the Atlantic and Pacific and was in
command of the British ship Cromarty
shire when that vessel was run down by
the French liner La Bourgoyne.
The Cromartyshire was here about four
years ago in command of Captain Hen
derson. From here she went to Europe
and thence to New York. At the latter
port she loaded for Japan and was on
her way there when La Bourgoyne came
along. "We heard the steamer blowing
her fog signal for an hour before we came
in collision," said Captain Henderson.
"Had the mall steamer stopped we could
have saved nearly all the passengers and
crew. As it was we saved nearly 150 peo
ple. Our collision bulkhead was the only
thing that saved us from going down."
The Cromartyshire afterward reached
port and was repaired, but the litigation
that followed kept Captain Henderson
ashore for nearly two years, and the
Largo Law Is the first vessel he has com
manded since. The owners of La Bour
goyne fought the damage suits through
all the courts, but Captain Henderson's
owners finally won out. ..
New Steamers for the Orient.
The Eastern Shipbuilding Company of
New Jersey has a large contract on hand.
The new concern has been incorporated
with a capital of $500,000 and has the con
tract to build two ocean steamers for the
Great Northern Steamship Company. The
vessels will be 625 feet long, 73 feet beam
and 31 feet 6 Inches deep, and will have a
speed of twenty knots. They will run be
tween Seattle and the Orient, replacing
the Nippon Yusen Kaisha steamers now
under charter to Jim Hill.
The Pomona and Umatilla,
A story was current on the water front
Friday that the steajners Pomona and
Umatilla were nearly in collision in th*
fog off the coast of Mendocino on Thurs
day last. The log of the Umatilla shows
that on Thursday at 7 a. m. she was
6eventy-five miles southeast of Cape Men
dooino. At that time the lookout reported
the Pomona three-quarters of a mile
away on the port bow. There was no
interchange of signals, no change of
course and that was the nearest the two
steamers ever came together. Captain
Cousins is one of the most careful navi
gators on the coast, and the story that
the steamers came near to a collision
was received with credulity on the front.
Trouble on the Afghanistan.
There was considerable trouble on the
voyage of the British ship Afghanistan
during the voyage from Newcastle, Aus
tralia, to San Francisco. A Russian Finn
named Hansen was in hot water with
everybody on board. During a row with
the second mate he drew a knife and
cut the officer in three places. Mate Har
vey was laid up for fourteen days with
his wounds and Hanson was placed in
irons. As soon as the Afghanistan came
to anchor in the bay last Friday night
Hansen managed to get out of his con
finement and made his escape. Captain
Craigie thinks that he was taken away
in one of the shore boats and that he
will be at sea again in a few days. Ves
sels looking for crews would better be
ware of Hansen, as he is said to be a
desperate man.

3Inni]a Cigars Secreted in. Basement
of One Man's Trousers and Un
der the Vests of the
Others. L
Customs inspector E. E. Emlow nas
reported to the Collector of the Port a
rather ludicrous adventure that befell him
last Saturday night. He was on duty at
the dock where the Government transport
Meade was laid up, and sat in a chair at
the end of the wharf the better to observe
the side of the ship in order to prevent
smuggling.
At half-past 9 o'clock he saw three very
dignified looking gentlemen on the deck
of tfys transport approaching the gang
way. Inspector Emlow at once left Ins
chair and took up his station at the gang
way as tha smallest of the three started
down the plank.
"1 beg your pardon, gentlemen," said
Emlow. "but my duty requires me to
search you."
The three protested that they had noth
ing whatever concealed on their persons,
Lut a search revealed a box of Manila
cigars concealed under the vest of the
smallest man of the trio. The inspector
did not get this man's name. The next
man gave his name as Bher, and he
panned out a oox of fragrant Manilas
that was lying snugly against the small
of his back.
The third man, a big fellow, gave his
name as Dr. Gustayus A. Christensen, a
dentist with an office on Mission street.
When the Inspector started to search him
the dentist whispered Into the inspector's
ear the grand hailing cries of distress ot
eeveral secret societies and gave him the
gTips and hailing signs of the same, say
ing at the sajne time: "Keep mum and
you and I will do i business together.
You're pretty foxy; keep mum, for heav
en's sake!"
But the inspector gave the grand hail
ing signs of distress of the one hundred
and forty-seventh degTee the grand go
by and explored the garments of the man
who said he was a dentist, extracting
therefrom without the aid of a forceps or
the use of gas a box of smuggled cigars
stowed away in the capacious seat of the
dentist's trousers. His pockets were
stuffed with the contents of another box,
and these also were seized by the In
spector.
The trio admitted that the four boxes of
weeds were the property of the man who
said he was a dentist and that they were
assisting him in smuggling them ashore.
After filling the big man with good advice
the inspector allowed the trio to go on
their way. and handed the cigars to his
superior officer for condemnation and sale.

Bemarkable Curative Properties of a
Stomach Weakness.
Bemedy for Indigestion and
Etuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, a prepara-
tion for tho cure of dyspepsia and the
various forms of Indigestion and stomach
trouble, owes Its great success as a cure
for these troubles to the fact that It is
prepared for disease and weakness of the
stomach and digestive organs only, and
is not recommended of advised for any
other disease.
It Is not a cure-all, but for any stom-
ach trouble It Is undoubtedly the Bafest,
most sensible remedy that can be ad-
vised with the prospect of a permanent
cure. It Is prepared ln tablet form, pleas-
ant to taste, composed, of vegetable and
fruit essences, pure pepsin and Golden
Seal, every one of which act effectively
!n digesting the food eaten, thereby rest-
Ing and Invigorating the weak stomach;
rest Is nature's cure for any disease, but
you cannot rest the stomach unless you
put into it something: that will do Its
work or assist in the digestion of food.
That Is exactly what Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets do; one grain of the digestive
principle contained In' them will digest
3000 grains of meat, eggs or similar whole-
some foods. They will digest the food
whether the stomach Is ln working order
or not, thereby nourishing the body and
resting the stomach at the same time
and rest and nourishment Is nature's cure
for any weakness. "i-r? Â¦-
In persons run down ln flesh and ap-
petite these tablets build up the strength
and increase flesh, . because they digest
fiesh-formlnp food which the weak stom-
ach cannot do: they Increase the flow of
gastric juice and prevent fermentation,
acidity and sour watery risings.
Stuart's, Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
at alfdrugr stores at 50 cents per package.

A Coroner's jury decided yesterday that
Maurice McHenry, tho aged expressman
who was killed by being run over by the

point of crossing."
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
COMPANY EXONERATED
Board of Public Works Recommends
to Supervisors That Work Be
Commenced at Once.
The Board of Public Works adopted a
resolu\ion yesterday directing that the
secretary "recommended to the Board of
Supervisors that the wharf or plank road
way on a part of Spear street between
Harrison and Byant streets be recon
structed to conform In elevation to the
wharf maintained adjacent to the pro
posed structure by the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners. The area to be
thus planked is the easterly half of the
westerly half of Spear Btreet, from a point
23S feet southerly from the southerly line
of Harrison street; thence southerly along
Spear street 3S7 feet to a point seventy-live
feet southerly from the northerly line of
Bryant street, and joining the State
wharf at that point. The estimated cost
of this work to be S61S0."
The proposed improvement will be high
ly satisfactory to the teamsters and dray
men who are obliged to traverse that por
tion of the street which has been in a
disgraceful condition for years. The Board
of Works expects to have all the plans
ready so that the improvement may be
commenced early next month.

Mattie Frawley, who the police say 13
one of the cleverest female thieves in tho
country, was arrested last night by De
tectives Ryan and O'Dea and locked up
In the California Police Station. To-day
she will be formally charged with grand
larceny.
About a week ago the prisoner, accom
panied by another woman who has not
yet been apprehended, visited a lodging
house at 225 Grant avenue and. It Is al
leged, stole a valuable seal skin sacque
belonging to one of the inmates. The
sacque was disposed of in a Third street
pawn shop for a lew dollars.
The Frawley woman lias on more than
one occasion been accused of theft. Some
time ago she was arrested together with
two men for committing wholesale rob
beries south of Market street. The mÂ«n
were sent to the penitentiary, but as the
woman, who is quite young, promised to
reform, she was committed to the County-
Jail for a short term. It Is more than
likely, that several charges will be placed
against her to-day.

SPECIAL CERTIFICATES
INVOLVED IN DOUBT
Board of Examiners Believes Creden
tials of Drawing Teachers to
Be Insufficient.
The matter of the renewal of the certifi
cates of Miss Katherlne M. Ball, teacher
of drawing, and several other special
teachers in the school department, is in
volved in some doubt and the Board of
Examiners may direct Miss Ball to take
an examination before a renewal is al
lowed. There is no question of Miss Ball's
efficiency and ability to teach the special
study, but the members of the board are
inclined to believe that she was illegally
granted a certificate on October 31, 1894,
upon credentials from an institution not
recognized as being of equal rank - with
the University of California by the 8tate
Board of Education. She received her
certificate October 31. 1894, on her diploma
from Cooper's Institute of Art of New
York City.
The matter has been referred . to the
board's legal adviser for an opinion. The
point to be decided is whether the law
contemplates that an applicant must hav*
a diploma from an accredited . institution
to teach a special â¢ or technical subject.
"Miss Ball teaches drawing in all schools
and it may be that she will be required to
take an examination In reading, spelling;,
grammar and methods of teaching in ad
dition to drawing. In the latter study
R per cent Is required and In the four
others CO per cent. There appears to be
no doubt that Miss Ball could get much
more than the required percentage in an
examination. It is possible that the Board
of Education may take the ground that
Phe is legally entitled to a renewal, a3
Director Denman has often declared that
certificates for special studies are In a
measure exempt from the provisions of
the State law, and may be granted on
credentials satisfactory to the board.
to locate niter claims. He was furnished
with money and reported that he had been
successful. It is now claimed that his
representations were false. The particular
amount of defalcation charged in tho
complaint is $60, -but the total amount is
said to be mu':h greater.' Price was ar
rested about three months ago on a simi
lar charge, i but as the complaining wit
ness refused to prosecute the case was
dismissed.

SHRINERS OFF ON AN
EXCURSION TO TAHOE
The Past Masters' Association of Cali
fornia* Free and Accepted Masons, cele
brated St. John's day yesterday by an ex
cursion to and picnic at El Campo. About
700 ladles and gentlemen composed the
party that boarded the Ukiah for the
pretty camp on the Marin County shore.
'Among the number were many who are
well known In Masonic and Eastern Star
circles. The forenoon hours were devoted
to lunching under thÂ» trees; then fol
lowed dancing in the pavilion and after
that there was an innovationâ the .intro
duction for the rirst time in the history
of the association of races on the 'cinder
track. The results of these races, in
which the onlookers as well as the par
ticipants took a great interest, were as
follows, the sprinters, coming in in the
order named:
"Boys under 10 yearsâ Willie Claaby, Willie
Stark, Alexander Kins:.
Girls under 10 yearsâ Elsie Fuendlinp, Anita
Fuendltns. Katie Zeiss.
Â¦ Boys between 10 and 16â B. McMillan, H.
McMillan, E. Rhormada. -

The judges of the games were Andrew
Peabody, William Owens and Thomas
Rowland. Justice Frank H. Kerrigan
was to have entered for a race against
time, but when he ascertained that the
prize was an order for 500 building bricks
he canceled the entry, saying that he
might find use for "gold" bricks, but had
no use for the real article.
After the games all repaired to the
dancing platform, where William Owens,
the Mason orator, read a short humorous
poem, full of skits at prominent members
of the fraternity who were present. After
that was the distribution of sixty gate
prizes, and then dancing was resumed.
Between dances there was an Impromptu
programme, William S. Moses, Charles H.
Bryan, John Tonningsen, Itev. W. E.
Smith and others being called upon for
contributions in the entertainment line.
The class of people who attended was

Wife of Dr. John Duncan
McLean Granted Legal
Separation.
" â _,
After a secret hearing of her appllca-
tlon for a divorce,, Edith Elizabeth Mc-
Lean has been freed from her husband,
Dr. John Duncan McLean. The decree
was granted Mrs. McLean by Judgb
Bahrs a week ago Saturday. Failure to
provide and neglect were the grounds on
which" her permanent separation from Dr.
McLean was sanctioned by the court.
In her complaint Mrs. McLean alleged
that she married her husband in Hor
nillon, Canada, In "1875. For years they
lived happily together, but something
over a year ago Dr. McLean deserted her
and refused to longer contribute toward
her support. Mrs. McLean engaged thÂ«Â»
services of Bishop & Wheeler, and on be
half of that firm Attorney L. Hoefier con
ducted, the proceedings In secret. The
facts of the divorce became public prop
erty yesterday, however.
Suits Â£or divorce were filed yesterday
by Margaret G. Laing against J. A. Lalng
for failure to provide; Hal Morse against
Mary E. Morse for desertion; George V>'.

sertion, and Anna Llnd against Charles

THE host of friends of Alexander W.
Pape will be pleased to learn of his
engagement to Miss Agnes Walsh,
a charming young lady of this city,
daughter of the late John T. Walsh, JJ. 8.
A. (retired).
Mr. Pape Is* widely known as an ath
lete. He has been the amateur champion
single sculler of the coast for two years
and Is also noted for his feats, as a swim
mer. He is prominently Identified with
the Olympic Club, tho Dolphin Swimming
and Boating Club 'and is also a member
of the National Parlor, N. S. G. W. His
brother, Eric Pape, is one of the noted
Illustrators of America,. his work appear
ing regularly In the principal magazines.
Mr. Pape Is an attache of tho American
Biscuit Company.
The friends of the young bride arid
groom, to bo, await with Interest the
further announcement of the day on
which they will bo united In marriage.
liotween June 30 and July 9 the Joint ex
ccutive ar.d advisory committees of the
Republican County Committee will hear
complaints If any be filed. The an
nounced purpose of the governing body
of the party In San Francisco is to give
every Republican elector residing In the
city an opportunity to Join a regularly or
ganized and legitimate club and partici
pate in the manayanent of party affairs.
It is presumed tr tt the clubs will nom
inate delegate tic ;cts to be voted for at
the primary elect on on the second Tues
day of August. The grog shop loafers,
racetrack touts and railroad hirelings can
be excluded from the Legislature and po
litical conventions if the good citizens of
the party will Join clubs, attend meetings,
register and vote. The interest manifested
in enrollment last evening by the taxpay
ers and other good citizens indicated a
determination upon th* part of Republi
cans to ?end good delegations from this
city to the nominating convention. In
Â£Â«veral Assembly districts the number
eigning the roil exceeded the early calcu
lations. An approximate estimate places
the number enrolled last night at 1400.
Complaint w.ts mad<> to the county com
mittee that John J. Curry, committeeman
of the Forty-third I.istrict, was inclined
to be somewhat arbitrary. The voters of
the Forty-third must make a little ;allow
ance fur Curry- He is new in the party
and not familiar with Repnblican meth
od?. When he figured in politics prior to
thin campaign he was known best as the
candidate for State Printer on he Demo
cratic ticket. In many respects Mr. Curry
is a man of mature and pound judgment.
Having- served in all political parties, he
repards the Republican party as the best
for the country and Curry.
The outgoing State Executive Commit
tee of the Democratic party did not
transact business yesterday owing to fail
ure in efforts to rally a quorum at the
California Hotel.
A call has been issued for a mooting of
the outgoing Democratic State Central
Committee on next Wednesday at 11 a. m.
The enrollment of Republican voters, as
a preliminary step toward the formation
of. a club in each Assembly district, began
last evening. According to the plan
-adopted by the Republican County Com
mittee the rolls will remain open for sig
natures until Saturday evening. June 30.
The plans provide for the election of club
officers on the evening of July 9.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: A brave
man sacrificed bis life to save that of another,
thereby iÂ«rformins an net of true heroism. The
business men and the members of the different
theaters of San Francisco are making an effort
to show their appreciation nf true hprolsm by
aldtner to alleviate tho distress of the widow
and children of a true hero. Can ycu not sug
gest to the different churches of San Francisco
of all denominations that they, too, may do
fund subscription list in the hands of Fire
Chief Sullivan yesterday by sending in a
check for. $250, which is the largest dona
tion yet received from any source. There
were many other generous responses, and
Fire Chief Sullivan now has over $1800
on hand for the widow and children of
brave John Sweeney. The grand total of
subscriptions from all sources now foots
up over $4000.
The following valuable suggestion was
received yesterday at The Call office and
may be acted upon to-day:

C=, iHE Associated Theatrical Managers
â¢ have taken hold of the grand bene
fit for the John Edward Sweeney
11 fund with that sort of enthusiasm
tha-t bespeaks how mucn their
hearts are in tlie work. They have deter
mined to spare* no expense to make it one
of the greatest affairs of the kind ever
bold in this city from a financial as well
Â«s an artistic point at view. Kvery dollar
that is taken in will go into the iund for
the benefit of the vriaow and children of
the dead tire hero.
There was an enthusiastic meeting of
the managers in the office of Jlinager
John Mornsev at the Orpheum yesterday,
at which every theater in the city was
represented. They found awaiting them
a huge pile of notes and letters frum
irifmbtrs of. the profession and alt>o from
*l large number of amateurs offering their
services for the big entertainment. To
give the entire list would be to copy the
liame of every actor, musician and thea
tt-r attache that appears on the play bills
at ail the theaters and add to that the
names of very niar.y clever amateurs who
reside in the city. They all not only offer
ihiir services in the good cause but al
most beg to i>e placed on the programme
that they may be able to do something
for the family of the brave lire-man.
It was decided to leave the programme
to a committee, of which Manager Mor
risey was made chairman. The plan is to
give a three-hour entertainment by the
very best talent in the city. So much
that is good has been offered that cannot
possibly be utilized that the managers
have about decided to limit it to the num
bers of the profession who are now ap
pearing at local theaters. A possible ex
ception Â¦will be made in deference to Fire
Chief Sullivan, who has requested that
two special numbers on the list be left
for him to fill. The managers feel sorry
that they will not be able to use the ama
teur ta^nt, but the programme must be
limir.ted.
Will Meet to Arrange Programme.
This morning at 11 o'clock Manager
Morrisey will meet with the three stage
managers who have been* appointed on
the committee and Press Agent Phil Hast
ings cf the California and commence the
preparation of the programme. The stage
managers are George E. Lask of the Tiv
oli W. A. Cripps of the California and
Harry Orndorrf of the Orpheum. The
aim will be to get together the brightest
bits of drama, burlesque, farce, opera and
vaudeville that can be had in the city
and to put them together in a way that
will be sure to eaten the popular fancy.
It will be the greatest show ever given
la the city at any price, although the ad
mission price has been placed within the
reach of allâ at $1 for reserved seats.
The prices of boxes and loges was fixed
yesterdayâ that is, a minimum price was
Â«=et upon those favored places. The lower
boxes will be sold for $25 each, second tier
boxes $20, third tier boxes $li>, loges (two)
$25 each and palco boxes (two) $20 each.
If a purchaser wishes to pay more than
the stated price the "premium" will be
cheerfully accepted by the managers, who
make no 'secret of the fact that they hopÂ©
to make a neat sum out of the boxes
alone. Exchange tickets are already on
sale at the box offices of the various thea
ters, and 3000 have been sent to the Fire
Department to dispose of. The regular
box office sale will open at the Grand
Opera-house office on next Tuesday morn
ing at S o'clock.
Edr.a Wallace Hopper, the well known
actress, who arrived in town rather un
expectedly yesterday, set a good example
by purchasing J.v> worth of tickets. Many
theatrical people have asked for boxes,
but will have to take their chances when
the sple begins. Then* will be a strong
tendency to show special favors to payers
cf high "premiums." p
No Deductions for Expense.
No expenses whatever will be connected
with the show. The cost of lights, cos
tumes, etc., will be settled betwer-n the
managers. Owens, Varney & Green and
the Sterrett Show Printing Company,
who have furnished the bills for the en
tertainment, sent in receipted bills for the
work they did yesterday. There will
be no programmes or flowers fur sale
in the theater. One dollar will entitle a
person to see the entire show without
any annoyance and will pay the entire
bill. It is proposed to give the people
their money's worth.
The Musicians' Union has volunteered
the services of all the men who may be
needed. There will probably be several
chestras present from the various thea
Â¦rs. and it may be decided to combine
iem under one leader for a grand eon
Â¦rt number. There is so much fine ma
rial that It is really very difficult to de
de just what to do.

for them to dress at the Grand Opera
house. The carriage companies have
agreed to carry them free of charge from
the dressing-rooms of their respective
theaters to the Grand Opera-house and
to carry them back apain after the show.
At the prices offered if the Grand Op
era-house can be filled, as it certainly
should be for the credit of the city, it
is estimated that fully $3300 will be real
ized from the entertainment. But the
managers hope for and expect more from
premiums, and will be very much sur
prised if the total sum does not exceed
$4000. Â¦

Respectfully, ROBERT WILSON,
700 Car>P street.
People need not hold back their sub
scriptions because they fear the fund will
become too large. It is Intended to raise
a sufficient sum to provide an annuity for
the widow and her four children that will
keep them out of want until the children
are grown and are able to take care of
themselves and their mother. It is esti
mated that it will take at least $15,000 to
do this properly. The cause is a good one
and everybody ought to give something.
r.o matter how small the amount.
Fire Chief Sullivan wishes to warn the
public, through the columns of The Call,
that unauthorized parties are collecting
for an allegred Sweeney fund. No one i3
authorized except theatrical agents and
the uniformed men of the Fire Depart
ment, who carry tickets stamped with the
Fire Department seal.

easily. Around the Tar turn Boland began
to let down his mount, but only slightly,
the first three moving to the pole denoting
the final quarter-milv to the wire' half
lengths apart. There Gibson surely would
go to the front, thought the crowd.
Sidney Lucas Takes the Lead.
But it was Sidney Lucas which was
moving to the front. Boland urged Lieu
tenant Gibson. He passed James for a
few seconds, but Sidney Lucas was in
front.
"Gibson is beaten!" sounded the cry,
first of surprise, again in tones of despair.
And Gibson was beaten.
Shortly afterward he was caught be
tween Sidney Lucas and James and his
progress slightly, interfered with. Boland
would have had to go around, but the
two were leaving the carrier of many
thousands of dollars of public money be
hind. There, between the quarter and the
eighth posts, was decided the thirteenth
American Derby. Thompson Brothers'
colt outstripped James, and an eighth of
a mile from home he had two open lengths
to the good. For an instant Gibson ral
lied and drew up slightly ahead of James,
but it was his last rally.-
On to the wire, graining at every stride,
came Sidney Lupas. Past the judges*
stand he galloped, six lengths before
James. The latter was second, eight
lengths before the^even-money proposition
on which Boland had been making every
effort known to trained jockeys in a futile
effort'to arouse his mount. Bui- it was no
use. Gibson had dope his best. Tom Bar
rett's mud horse Barrack was four lengths
behind Gibson and two and a half before
Advance Guard, while Sam Phillips, the
second choice, brought up the rear.
May Never Repeat the Trick.
- Looking back at the race It Is still hard
for turf critics to see why Gibson lost,
and equally difficult to figure out ho.w
Sidney Lucas won. He was beaten by
Advance Guard in the Canadian Derby,
and that race was supposed to militate
strongly against his chances in figuring
a possible winner. Of James little was
known except that. he had performed well
in several Eastern races. Sidney Lucaa
may never again beat this field at the
weights, but he to-day had the blue rib
bon event of Washington Park to his
credit in 2:40%. creditable, considering the
conditions, and his owners are richer by
$3975, the amount of first money. The own

Damp and Foggy "Weather Interferes
With the Club's Expert xtod-
Wielders.
The eighth of the series of contests of
the San Francisco Fly-Casting Club were
held yesterday at Stow Lake, Golden Gate
Park. The casters encountered weather
which was damp and foggy, interfering
somewhat with good scores in general,
although some of the individual work was
exceptionally good. Golcher cast 124 feet
in "distance" and was followed by Lovett
with 121 feet. Carr and Skinner tied with
95 per cent in "accuracy," while Everett
won the "delicacy" event with 87 9-12 per
cent. Lovett carried off the honors in the
"lure" casting event with a score of
5>5 3-5 per cent, while Carr and Edwards
tied for second place with 87 4-5 per cent.

CHICAGO, June 23.â Sidney Lucas, al
most neglected in the betting at
odds of 20 to 1, won the thirteenth
American Derby this afternoon at
"Washington Park. Six lengths behind
him was the Eastern colt. James, and still
further back, struggling to no avail, was
the vaunted public choice, the even money
favorite, Lieutenant Gibson. Barrack.
Advance Guard and Sam Phillips brought
up the procession, which carried little joy^
to the 30,000 spectators who saw the great
classic decided. That rush of Sidney Lucas
through the stretch and that falling back
of Lieutenant Gibson were so sudden, so
startling, that they fairly stupefied the
crowd. No tumultuous applause for the
winner when the . contenders cantered
back to the judges' stand! No wild dem
onstrations from those who had wagered
upon his chances! Only faint applause
from a scattered few greeted Jockey Bull
man and the Topgallant colt. .
Eight out of every ten horsemen whose
opinions are accepted as valuable had
picked Gibson to Â¦win and win easily over
a track supposed to be just to his liking
âslightly Blow and holding, but drying
out rapidly under the bright sun. Per
haps not one in a hundred had picked
Sidney Lucas to turn the trick; certainly
not one in a thousand imagined he would
win practically off by himself. The atti
tude of the crowd was almost that of
sullen disappointment, yet it was a true
run race under the conditions. Lieuten
ant Gibson, the favorite, had no excuse.
Â¦'Sara Phillips, the second choice, was in
about the same unfortunate category.
Thus the great event passed into turf an
nals "and registered tho ninth defeat of
a favorite in a race which has' been con
tested thirteen times.
Immense Crowxl Present.
Before the result, mourned by so many,
had thrown its damper upon the spirits
of nearly all exce~pt the bookmakers, the
scene was one of animation. Flashes of
color in bewildering profusion shone out
from the swell turnouts and automobiles
and in the field where society viewed the
race. From the clubhouse, even more se
lect, there was one bewildering array of
pretty Women in derby gowns, while in
the grand stand, where a great majority
settled* to pay honor to the game thor
oughbred, supreme on Derby Day-, there
was a bewildering and kaleidoscopic
sprinkling of thqse dainty tints which
form the costumes of women and enhance
their beauty. Against this setting the
sterner apparel of their escorts framed
the background. Yet with all the society
features it was a crowd draw"n largely
from the people. The men and women who
attend races but once a year were there.
They appreciated everything and inmost
instancs fared the best on the day, for
they had no messengers to execute com
missions in the almost Impassable betting
ring. ' -.
When the starters . and? Jockeys were
posted for the star event of the day the
crowd, or rather the male portion, surged
in almost endless streams toward the
ring, where the penclllers stoon on their
little stools offering odds. The booths,
prevalent on Western tracks, were miss
ing; instead there was the system of the
East, more on the handbooking plairi.
Only the hardy stood through that crush.
0MERICAN DERBY WINNERS.
When at last the bugle called the six
chosen thoroughbreds to the post there
was a hushed expectancy. All were eager
to see the royal purple of "Board of
Trade" Charley Smith, borne ky Lieuten
ant Gibson, for the colt had not mqde a
public appearance In Chicago. 'The ex
pectations were more than realized. He
was the only really racy-looking young
ster in the bunch, his mincing and > side
stepping plrouettings standing out in
contrast to the rather dejected appear
ance of the balance of the field. Sidney
Lucas attracted attention, but it was the
attention bestowed upon red flannel band
ages upon his forelegs.
Looked Like a Cripple.
"It's too bad to start such a cripple,"
said, one sympathizer.
Others smiled knowingly In derision.
The colt appeared as if he would wel
come death as a providential escape from
heavy care. But that was before the mile
and a half Journey had been traveVsed.
Around to the start at the half-mile
post slowly wended the field. There the
nervous temperament of Lieutenant Gib
son showed In his uneasy shlftlngs. One
false break, in which Advance Guard was
bolting sideways the barrier arose, and
then Starter Dwyer dropped his red flag,
signifying a start.
"They're off!" came that old, familiar
cry from the immense throng.
Barrack's nose was in front, with James
second and the favorite third. Gibson's
position was what concerned the public,
and it was satisfactory. Â¦
Around the stretch turn and down the
straightaway for the first time, swung
the field. Coming past the grand
stand Lieutenant Gibson, fighting for his
head, was leading by a head, and James
running almost as easily but without that
overwhelming desire to rush to the front
was second. Sam Phillips, the hope of the
Schorr stable, with Jockey Tommy Burns
in the saddle, occupied third position. The
disconsolate looking Sidney Lucas was
fourth, with Barrack and Advance Guard
bringing up the rear.
On pwept the fleld past the quarter
pole, Sidney Lucas displacing Sam Phil
lips i in third position. Jockey Mitchell
loosened hie wrap on the reins through
the back stretch and James moved to
Â¦the- van. He was only a length before
Gibson, who had Lucas at nis saddle
girth.' Still therewas no indication of the
impending disaster. The son' of G. "W.
Johnson and Sophia Hardy was. going
and the timid were glad when the. race

The talent had things its own way at
the Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday in
the run-down of the open stake. Favorites
won ail but a half-dozon of the courses,
which throughout the day were mostly of
the povere order.
The course between Cruiser and Chicago
Boy furnished quite a little excitement.
Cruiser was a despised outsider and the
talent thought so little of his chances
that It quoted 25 to 1 against him. The
pikers took a few tickets on general prin
ciples and quite a play was made on the
event. The dogs were slipped to a flukey
liare that favored Cruiser at every jump
and almost ran into his mouth. The short
ender barely m!rt?cd the game several
tirms. and during the first half of the rim
had he made the kill would have beaten
his opponent pointless. Chicago Boy
finally grot in his work and won out, to the
great relief of the plungers.
Lily of the West was beaten by Belle
Claire, who sold on the short end at 2 to 3.
Bflle was the best in the race, showed
the speed and did good work. The win
ner i* in good position to reach the finals.
Bonita went oufto Miss Allen at 2H to 1,
Â¦which were fals? odds. The winner meets
Klttleman to-day, with chances against
her. Lowlandcr. in a race lasting nearly
two and a half minutes, got the flag from
Storm King. The hard work will Interfere
with him. though he Is in good trim.
Lowe <Â£ Thompson's kennel did some good
work. Five of their entries got decisions.
Palmflovi'er >von a long, hard race from
Hard Lines, and though she Is iVi good
position to get well down on the card the
rough work will probably tell against h*r.
The general long courses of yesterday
make to-day's races close and even for the
better class' remaining in the stake.

vicious blow on tne jaw. McGovern recov

GEORGE C. PARDEE.
SAX FRANCISCO. June 23.
Mr. Chairman, we do well to favor with our
support and enthusiasm the Republican party
and Its principles'. No recollection In my lit*
affords me greater satisfaction than that it
was my privilege to cast my first vote for the
Immortal Lincoln, and that experience will
be repeated next November when. I vote again
for another grreat American â William McKln
ley.
Chairman Davis read the following tele
grams:
We are to be congratulated that the party is
united and determined for success in this cam
paign and the man calling himself a Republi
can who will inject factional prejudices 01
political personalities Into the contest Is un
worthy the name.
on election day. If he Is a member of your
club he is not so likely to forget or neglect to
register. No man In this State can vote at
the comln? election unless he registers before
the 26th day of September. What an oppor
tunity for the club to prove its value, to the
party. There are many other Wayg of doins:
good; and there are the social features. It is
my candid opinion that if every Republican In
California would join a club and maintain his
membership, the party would never again meet
with defeat in this State.
Permit me to say a few words upon the sub
ject of clubs. For the past stx years I have
been Identified with club work throughout the
country, and realize the benefits resulting to
our party through these organizations. The
club Is now recognized as one of the most ef
that every Republican In California may soon
be enrolled as a. member of such a body. %Ve
ask you of the Alliance, of the Young Men's
league, the Pondlnky and other clubs here to
night to see that your neighbor or acquaint
ance, whose leaning Is toward the Republican
faith becomes a member of your club; make
special efforts to secure the young man who
will cast his first vote this year, also those
who will soon become first voters. The Indi
vidual can do no bet<fr service to his Darty
than to secure one more intelligent voter; and
I take this opportunity on behalf of the State
Committee and the Republican party of Cali
fornia to extend our cordial Kreetlncs to the
Republican clubs and to assure them of our
hearty co-operation in the coming- work.
Now. for a few reasons why club orranlza
tlon is such an aid to the party. It is an un
fortunate truth that many Republicans are in
different to the obligation Imposed by the po
litical franchise. If a man becomes a member
of a club he will almost surely go to the polls
Mr. Chairman. Ladies and Gentlemen: I did
not come here to-night to make a speech, nor
shall I try to do so, but it Is a privilege for
me to take part in this grand meeting of en
thusiastic Republicans who have assembled to
ratify and confirm by their voice and presence
the choice of our delegates In convention for
the exalted positions of President and Vice
President of this great republic, and that such
a gathering is the work of Republican clubs is
most Eratlfylnc. .
Colonel George Stone, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee, fol
lowed with a speech urging the organiza
tion of Republican clubB throughout the
State. He said:
Colonel Stone for Organization.
The American people are worthy of their lib
erties and equal to their destiny. They know
what agency to employ, what party stands for
the nation's progress and territorial Integrity,
what administration secures prosperity, what
men to trust to carry out those principles and
purposes. Our will with theirs will be regis
tered aright in November, 1900.
and maintains our position of International re
spect In the world to-day, Republican protec
tion which is the source of our unexampled
prosperity; Republican policy which makes our
exports exceed our imports by more than a
billion of dollars per annum: Republican
statesmanship and courage administering the
affairs of thla vast nation at home and vindi
cating the flag of this republic -wherever as
sailed. All this the Democratic party has op
posed and opposes yet. Misguided citizens of
this nation have passed word to American
islands that the enforcement of American law
and order Is oppression, but th? inhabitants of
these Islands will soon learn that the rightful
authority of American civilization and govern
ment is not the sword of a new oppressor come

Davis of the following telegram from the
President of the United States:
Message From the President.
Mr. McKInlay reviewed In eloquent
story the lives of the Presidents, and
evoked cheer after cheer in his perora
tion uwon the President and Theodore
Roosevelt.
And this word, "imperialism," has been in
vented as a catch word like "free trade" and
"free silver." It i.Â« a 11* as to any policy which
can be pursued under the constitution of the
t'nited States. Xo President, no ConsresK. no
Supreme Court can take away from the people
those liberties which are their own, and the
cry of "imperialism" Is nothlntr but the effort
of a demaeoirue to catch votes. In this cam
paign men are not to be swayed by excitement,
but by careful thought In the quiet of their
homes.
Figures are dry matters, but look Â»t these:
In 1S92 when President Cleveland took office
with the promise that conditions rrould be bet
tered, the w?alth of the 1'nlted States was $56.
000.O0Q.000. In 1536. aftpr four years Â«f lVmo
cratic rr.le. it had decreased to S44.0O0.0QO.M0.
In three years of Republican control It has
reached the tremendous total of JSO.OOO.OOO.OOO.
"But when the tempest of war came, the
other was standing out calm and serene, ever
ready to meet with strong band and mind the
storm over which he triumphed," continued
McKInlay. "These two men, the Nebraska
statesman and President MeKinley of the
United States, stand now before eighty million
people who are to say which shall lead them
for the next four years. There can be no doubt
of the result if the people shall be permitted
to understand the issues which shall be sub
mitted to them."
the Bhore line of comfort and ease and
tried by mouth work to win the people.
After PonRs by the Elks' Quartet, Dun
can E. McKInlay was introduced as one
who had risen from the ranks of thÂ»
tollers. Mr. McKInlay drew a lesson from
a parallel of two seamen, one gold-laced
and haughty, who steered his vessel in
smooth waters near the shore, the other
who sailed for the open sea. When the
storm came the first was lost, the other
fought and conquered the tempest In tri
umph. The first was the Nebraska states
man wlfo had, said the speaker, taken
McKinlay Draws a Parallel.
I don't believe in quarantine, but if even a
man or a party should be placed in quarantine
It Is that man or party which cannot realise
the beneficent results derived from, our wise
Republican administration.
During our administration we have paid off
more than $40,000,000 of the debt left by the
already refunding J298,(H>0,0OO of the' national
debt on a 2 per cent basis, saving thus J1S.000,-
TjO a year in Interest.
And this bubonic plairue party over In San
Francisco would place California In quarantine.
If It had not been -for Preeident MeKinley that
would have been done. As soon as he learned
through Colonel Stone and other distinguished
citizens that no such plague ever existed he safd.
"Remove that quarantine," and he did remove
the embargo that was placed on our fair State
Just as he removed the blight of stagnation
after ho took the oath of his high office.
I say front personal observation of many
months that not since the days of Lincoln have
tve had such a clean, upright, pure and patriotic
President as William McKlnley. *
least the courage to punish dishonesty when
ever it shall be discovered. The Republican
party ha9 inspired the confidence of . the na
tion, because as a party it has kept its prom
ises to the people. The Democrats are rallied
around a party of negation. When all was
dark with distress and depression four years
agro the Republican party came in and save
to the people a'Ueclaratlon of principles. Where
thpr*j was want of conflcl<?nce everywliere and
starvation In the land, to-day there Is not a
man or woman In this broad land who can
not find employment at reasonable wages If
they are willing to work.
Everywhere Is confidence, and confidence
means enterprise. Prior to the election of
President McKlnley the balance sheet in favor
of thÂ» United States as against the world, for
the 100 y^ars of our life as a nation, was $311.
000,000. In only three years we have raised that
credit balance in our favor to fl.-lQO.OOO.OQO. We
have done this and have carried on a jrreot
warâ but not a war that was sought by our
President. It was a war of humanity and re
sulted In the grandest victories of the century
on land and pea. The result wan the acquisi
tion of a territory across the ocean. The Phil
ippine Islands are to-day as much a part of the
United States as California Itself, and the
honor of the nation was pledged to maintain
law and order there. Had we not pledped our
selvrs to do that our Democratic friends who
are throwing missiles would have been the
first to say impeach the President. If any
thing has ?one wrong in the Philippines it is
the fault of Coneress, not of the President.

The battle occurred in a pasture whero
the ferocious trute was kept. He was
known to be of a most vicious temper, but
until this occasion had always been un

the lot to take the animal to water. While
leading the bull through the lot the beast
suddenly bellowed and with head lowered
made a wild charge at the rancher. Denis
tried to escape, but the bull caught him
on its horns and tossed the helpless man
and then gored him. breaking several of
Denis' ribs and crushing him severely as
he lay prostrate and dazed.

Extension of the Pound Limits to the
County Line to Be Pressed
With BenÂ«wed Vigor.
There was a large attendance of dele
gates present at the meeting of the Fed
eration of Mission Improvement Clubs at
Holly Park Club rooms last night. The
intention of holding an election of offi
cers for the ensuing six months being an
incentive for delegates to show up, as
the presidency of this organization is
looked to as being of sufficient importance
to draw forth a close vote.
Prior to going Into the election, how
ever, remarks were made by Delegate Dr.
E. N. Trello on the necessity of the Feder
ation urging on the Supervisors the ad
visability of passing an ordinance extend
ing the pound limits to the county line.
Facts and figures were produced to show
the havoc wrought by vagrant cattle
roaming at large over the property of set
tlers Irrespective of damage to buildings
and fences, not to mention danger to the
lives of children and women. Believing
this to be a nuisance the committee ap
pointed at a previous meeting to attend
to the matter was urtred to be present
at the meeting of the Supervisors to-mor
row and do the bracinc act with Mich
of the members as were prolific in prom

wished to bring within the limits.

The interest taken by Geperal McCook
In the affairs of Hawaii's ex-Queen are
due to the fact that he was th4 first Min
ister accredited by the Government of
the United States to the Hawaiian court.
In 1SC6, and during his term negotiated
the first treaty of commercial reciprocity-.
During his residence in Honolulu his firm
attitude toward the threatened British en
croachment on Hawaii undoubtedly saved
this Government from some very un
pleasant diplomatic complications with
England.
General McCook entered the Federal
army in 1860 as a private in the Kansas
Legion, and after a brilliant career of
five years, rose to the rank of brigadier
general. He was twice appointed by Pres
ident Grant as Governor of the then Ter
ritory of Colorado and there organized a
school system and an Immigration board
that was instrumental in development.
Through his personal efforts the first rail
road was built into Denver. He was the
first advocate of woman suffrage. After
his second term as Governor of Colorado
General McCook declined the portfolio of
Postmaster General, tendered to him by
President Grant.
GENERAL E. M. McCOOK.
GENERAL EDWARD M. McCOOK,
a member of the famous "fighting
McCook" family, who is '"now a
guest of Charles H. Blinn at 1S85
Post street, Is of the opinion that as soon
as the coming election is over and Presi
dent MeKinley Is settled for another term
of four years the administration will take
up the crown land claims of Liliuokalani,
the ex-Queen of Hawaii, and settle with
her for a handsome sum. As General Mc-
Cook is known to be a warm personal
friend of Senator Mark Hanna and close
to the administration, the friends of the
deposed Queen are much - comforted by
the assurances he has given.
The I>oubles Champions Play Well,
Although. Hampered by the
Prevailing Wind.
The usual Saturday crowd was at the
courts of the California Tennis Club yes
terday and the matches were of high
. order, as all the crack players were In
attendance.
Samuel Hardy made his first appearance
on the courts in several months and de
feated his brother Sumner In clever* style
by a score of 4 â 6, 6 â 1, 8 â 6.' Sumner took
the first set easily, and then Sam took a
brace and won trie second. The third was
close and Sam finally managed to win out
In vantage game, 8 â 6. Neither of the
Hardys played In their best form owing to
the high winds which prevailed during the
afternoon.
George Whitney defeated W. Collier,
6â 1, 6 â 4. While Collier played a good,
heady game, the champion was a bit too
cleyer for him.
Al Rosenberg defeated Bishop Moreland,
6â1, fr-3, 8-Â«.
Grant Smith moved a point In the rank
ing by cleverly defeating Dr. Root, giving
the talent a surprise. Smith was Invinci
ble at the net and won by well placed vol
leys, 6â3. 6â3. 6â8.
Robert Whitney played Alex Stewart of
Oakland, and although Stewart won the
first set easily Whitney secured the match,
4â 43. 6â1, 6â3. Both players scored many
points by their hard drives.
Paul Jones and Mr. O'Brien of Berkeley
had a long drawn out struggle, which re
sulted In a tie, 2-6. 4-â¬, 6â2, 6-4, 9â7,
3â6. J. A. Code defeated Alex Stewart,
6â4, 7â6. 2â6.
Walter McGavln, a base line player, and
Crowell, who plays the net game, had a
hot argument. McGavln won the first set,
6 â 4, by good passing, Crowell took the sec
ond, 8â6, in a close match and also the
third. 6-3.
Reuben Hunt of Alameda visited San
Rafael on Friday and played four sota
with W. Collier, all of which he won. The
score was 6â4, 6â1, 7â5, 6â4.
Tennis in Boston Is having quite a boom
now, as the Public Park Commissioners
have added thirty-eight new courts, mak
ing forty-eight in all. Even with this
large number, so much are the courts used
that It Is necessary sometimes to wait for
one. A petition has been presented to the
Golden Gate Park Commissioners request-
Ing them to lay out courts. They have
promised to do so next month.

OAKLAND, June 21-Wlth a mighty
battle cry the Republicans of
Alameda County â the banner Re
publican county of Californiaâ
gave voice to-night to their ap
proval of the National Republican Con
vention's nomination of McKlnley and
Roosevelt as their leaders In the campaign
of 1900. With patriotic demonstration In
music. 6ong and eloquent speech, the slo
gan was sounded at a monster ratification
meeting held in the Exposition building,
Oakland's largest auditorium. The as
semblage was most representative. Men
In all walks of life gathered to testify
their allegiance to the party. The name
of President McKlnley was loudly ac
claimed, while enthusiastic cheers for the
hero of San Juan testified to the added
strength his nomination brings to the
ticket.
The Republican Alliance, Oakland'i
crack campaign corps, lent its forces to
swell the enthusiasm. Headed by Henry
Petri, the 400-pound drum major, the al
liance paraded the streets, attracting, as
ever, much attention by its trim uniforms
and the soldierly bearing of its marching
members. The Exposition building was
draped in the national colors, mingled
with the numerous emblems of campaigns
in which the alliance has fought for six
teen years. As a setting to the civilian
speakers, the corps was banked at the
rear of the stage. On either end of the
platform were flag-draped portraits of
President McKlnley.
While the band played the "Star-
Spar.gled Banner" the great audience rose
en masse and stood during the rendition
of the national hymn. Then R. G. Luk
ens, president of the alliance,, expressed
his gratification at being able to call to
order the assemblage, and he declared It
was the duty of Alameda County to main
tain at the coming election its record as
the banner Republican county of the
State.

military. About Chinese events the Foreign
Offlee use* great reticence, and above all
etudlously avoids admittinjr that the
present events mean an actual and prob

Gei i ; i* n seizure of Klaochau. In this the
paper* are strengthened by the public
utterances of the German Missionary
Bishop of Bhantuns. Von Anzer, who re
cently described the disastrous effect
upon missionary work of the Klaochau
seizure*. In political circles here It is
known that the ForeJgm Office was quite
eurprised by the increasingly serious char
acter of the Chinese uprising.
W hile it is true Baron von Ketteler, the
Genman Minister at Peking, sent two
months agx> a detailed report irom Peking
containing: alarming- advices from the Ger
man Consuls throughout China and pre
dicting serious trouble before long, not
xriuch importance was attached here to
this report, because Ketteler was new in
Peking. But though the Emperor and
count von Bulow. the Minister of For
eign Affairs, do not attach much impor
tance to the news from China, they are
now thoroughly aroused. His Majesty de
clared Friday at Kiel that German inter
ests In China under no circumstances
must be allowed to euffer, no matter how
ereat the sacrifice.
The bulk of the German press takes
tie same view. The Krouz Zeitunff prints
en interesting editorial, laying:
It Is not certain what will be the flnal
outcome of the troubles In China. It will
be impossible to re-establish a vigorous
authoritative central government at Pe
king, euch as the powers desire and will
need. Presumably they will be obliged to
enlarge and give definite shape to the
? h% e r?Â£ lnl -erest policy and to further
timae China, either with or without leav
ing a nominal central government at Pe
king. To several of the powers the pres
ent crisis came too quickly, which further
endangered the situation."

accompanied by Grand Master Workman
Snook, paid a visit en the night of the

visitors were welcomed by Master Work
man Walters, and after the work of the
evening there were addresses by the
grand master workman, Secretary Malloy
of the extension committee, and by a
numbor of the deputies. Since this lodge
received, by consolidation, the members
of Park I^odge, there has been a little
more activity than there had been for
some time previous.
On the evening of the 14th Inst. there

expressions of satisfaction by the mem
bers, as by this addition to the roll of
the lodge it was entitled to the
diamond badge of honor offered by the
grand master workman. At the last held
meeting the badge was presented to the
lodge, and in turn presented by the lodge
to P. Menard, who was instrumental in
securing the greatest number of candi

During the past month Deputy Wells, who
has charge of the extension work of the

he had been for several years. He is again

Last Tuesday night there was a large

the evening John Heeringa, who for a
year past served In the capacity of dis
trict deputy grand master workman, was,
by the lodges of the district, presented
a handsome testimonial, the presentation
being by District Deputy Gus Pohlman,
in his usual happy manner. The presen
tation was on the anniversary of Mrs.
Heeringa's birth. In the same lodge it
was decided to have a social on the night
of the installation of the officers of the
lodge. A committee was appointed to ar
range for It. '-"-â¢â¢â¢''
At a recent meeting of Burns Lodge an
example was set which others might fol
low. Past Master Workman L. G. Schord
and Deputy District Grand Master Work
man Gus Pohlman each introduced a son
Into the order and jointly they assisted in
conferring the degrees on the young men.
Unity Lodge on last Tuesday night had
a great crowd of workmen and strangers
at its open meeting and smoker. Cigars,
pipes and tobacco served to occupy the at
tention of those present when they were
not listening to the programme that was
presented.
Grand Secretary Spencer paid a visit
last week to the lodge in Sonora and on
his way back to the city visited the lodge
at Soulsbyville. There he assisted in con

The entertainment and dance that was
given on the night of the 16th inst. by
Walhalla Rebekah Lodge (German) in
the Covenant Hall of the OJd Fellows'
bullying was one of the most successful
social functions ever given by this hos
pitable lodge. The committee that ha<3
charg-e of this affair was composed or
Mrs. Flora Cress. Mrs. Sophie Schultz,

Those members of Temrlar Rebekah
Lodge and a few invited friends, in all
thirty ladlts and gentWmen, under the
leadership of Jack Thompson, the vet
eran mountain climber, who started from
Hoss Valley at midnight on Saturday, the
l<5th in?t.. had a glorious time reaching
the ap<?x of Mount Tamalpais in time to
see the *un rise the next morning. It
was a fine moonlight walk by slow stages,
but by the time the last of the ten-mile
ascent had been reached there were a few
who were decidedly tired. On the return
by way of the Mill Valley trail Thompson
took the party by what he declared was
a *.hort cut that would save miles of
walking. Either Thompson had lost his
bearings or he made a bluff about a short
cut, for when the end of the trail was
reached it was either catch on to the
branches of an overhanging tree and
drop fifteen feet or slide. Thompson, to
show how *-a.<=y it was. dropped, and Mrs.
Dele Warford. past grand of the lodge,
pave an exhibition of how easy it was to
slide. It was a Elide that "Ten -Thou sand
Dollar Kelly" would have given a good
EÂ«m to pee. Had it not been for a large
bowlder that was providentially in the:
way and arrested Mrs. Warford in her
downwad course, it is probable that phe
would rot have stopped until she reached
the depot *Â»t Mill Valley. She says that
the slide was exciting, but that she pre
ierp to walk. In the party there were
Jack Thompson. Mrs. Ada Patterson.
Mrs. Mollie Black. Mrs. Mary Elizabeth

Tommy (going out) â It's all right; I
think I know how wars besin.â Los An

"Mamma, how do wars begin?"
"Well, suppose the English hauled down
the American flag and that the Ameri
cans" â
Here Tommy's father Intervened.
"My dear," he said, "the English would
not" â
Mother â Excuse me, they would â
"Now, dear, who ever heard of such a
thing?"
"Pray do not Interrupt!"
"But you are giving Tommy a wrong
Idea."
"I'm not, sir!"
"You are. madam!"
"Don't call me madam! I won't allow
you!"
"I'll call you what I choose!"
Tommy was reading the war news.
"When he finished he came over to his
mother and said:
One morning the readers of an es
teemed contemporary were perplexed to
see in type the announcement that "The
Scotus handed down an important decision
yesterday." The afternoon paper of the
town, with whom the morning paper for
years had held a bitter controversy, inter
esting none but themselves, laughed that
dav, as the poets say, "in ghoulish glee,"
and It was up to the morning paper the
next day to explain that "the types" made
them say that the Scotus did so and so,
when the telegraph editor should have
known that that word was merely the ab
breviation of the telegrapher for Supreme
Court of the United States.
One Sunday a preacher at McKees
Rocks. Pa., took for his text, "Be ye
therefore steadfast," which being inter
preted in the weekly paper, meant, "Be
ye there for breakfast/'
It was the mistake of the makeup man
that put a face powder puff between two
death notices, and the telegraph editor,
who stayed late that morning, saw it and
had it routed out of the stereotype plate.
Style is everything in a newspaper office,
and some papers spell "theatre," "cen
tre," "livre" and so on with a final er.
That is why O!*e of these papers a while
ago announced that a celebrated French
actor received a salary of "300 livers.
It would be a long story to tell In detail
how mixups happen, but that they really
do happen can be doubted by no news
paper man whose knowledge of the busi
ness ever led him to explorations of the
mysteries of the composing room, as well
as the somewhat intricate mazes of the
editorial room. And so this heartbreaking
account of a marriage may. be vouched
for as an actual occurxence: â¢"' '
"The church was finely decorated with
holly and evergreen, and the altar was
entirely hidden in a wealth of ilowers.
Out of the recesses rose rare tropical
plants, and from the celling hung fifteen
Western veals, which Just at the- time of
year are scarce and correspondingly dear,
at 6S8M.C per lb. There was also an ac
tive demand for choice lambs, and farm
ers living east of the Mississippi River
can now profitably turn to sheep raising
and take the bride, who wore a gown of
white corded silk, a creation of Worth s
with pearl ornaments.
"Then came the maid of honor, the
cousin of the bride, a Miss Henrietta
Blower of Chicago, wearing a dress of
white tulle, with diamond ornaments, and
she was closely followed by a small
bunch of Montana sheep, which bleated
most piteously as they were driven on
board and shipped to the winter hotels in
Bermuda, , ,
"They will there be cut en tralne and
slightly decolette, and after the remainder
of the party had reached- the rail the
minister turned- and said in a most im
pressive voice, 'I cannot bid more than
6^4 cents for state veals, but cablegrams
from London quote refrigerated beef at
a price that will enable me to pay $4 90
for a car of choice Indiana beeves, and
hearing this there was a rush, for the
young married couple, and the bride fell
into the arms of her father, who is
known to bear a very striking resem
blance to a Connecticut ox weighing 1873
pounds. The market here took an upward
turn, and advanced Iiffi2c. and the guests,
who numbered about 200, were served with
a sumptuous dinner at the house of the
brides
'â¢That's all right, Billy. You had that
mixed up with your turf stuff; but I
straightened It out for you."
"But why didn't you let it go as I wrote
It?" persisted the editor.
"I' couldn't," was the reply. "Who ever
heard of nsh running?"
Sometimes the proofreader fails to cor
rect, and sometimes he doth correct too
much. The sporting editor of a San Fran
cisco newspaper had among his notes an
item which said: "The young salmon are
beginning to run." The next morning the
statement was printed on his page that
â¢â¢The young salmon are beginning to
swim." When the .editor asked how it
happened, the proofreader said cheerily:
The style on that paper called for ex
pressing the hours by figures, so when the
"ad" appeared It read like this:
From 8:"0 to 10:30
You laugh and laugh and laugh again.
From half-past eight till half-past ten
You laugh and laugh and laugh again.
Dreadful execution is done sometimes
by the man behind the types, says the
Mail and Express. Once a newspaper man
wrote an "ad" for a theater, and in it
said:
FREAKS OF THE TYPE.

CHICAGO, June 23.â July wheat opened 2TÂ»@
8%c higher at Â£6c to 87c, advanced to S8c, de
clined to 86%c and then rallied to SSo, clos
ing at the last given price, 4?ic over yesterday.
This In cold figures is the etory of a wild,
panicky and decidedly bulljsh market. The
opening was rather startling in its strength,
but throughout the session the market had
the appearance of bullishness gone wild. An
advance of 3d at Liverpool and a mass of
messages reporting an almost total failure of
the spring wheat crop in the Northwest brought
in buying orders by the 'hundreds. Many sec
tions of the Dakota* and Minnesota and of
Manitoba reported total failures. Others told
of thin, spare, sickly crops, good 'for from
three to six bushels to the acre. There wai
still no Indication of rain In the Northwest,
while the temperature remained high; There
was little talk to-day of improvement if good
rain should fall even at this late date. Stat
istician Snow's estimate of a crop of 75,000,000
bushels for the three States, should there be.
no further deterioration, was conceded too
high by many to-day. At the opening the pit
was Jammed with buyers and sales were made
ajl the way from S6c to 87c. Heavy proflt
taklng by longs kept the crowd' from going
perfectly crazy. There was, apparently, no
big short Interests. Longs, following the open
ing, forced July back to Â«3VÂ»c by dumping large
lots on the market. Then the market bucked
with a vengeance. The Northwest was a heavy
buyer as usual, and foreigners with whom
most of the short Interest apparently lay
covered freely. July under this buying and
â¢ome let up In the realizing pressure rebounded
to ESc. Longs crushed . It back. to S6*ic again,
but permanent dips were not 0/1 the schedule
and the market closed entirely recovered at
fully "4c over -yesterday at S8c. This Is an
advance of 12TÂ»ct since last Saturday. Before
the crowd left July wheat sold at 83c. The
cash business was a small consideration."

New York Stock Market.
NHW YORK. June 23.â The Saturday short
cession of the Stock Exchange was a fe\-erish
and exciting one, under the domination of
much the same Influences aa for some days
past. The holiday in London left the New
York Block markt-t without its accustomed
cruide to the Ejx-culatK'e sentiment of the out
t-ide worM, frith. the usual result that profes
sional roora traders were at sea for a time
after the opening. The sentiment observable
for tea* time iÂ«ast among the professional
traders was that the market was ovemld and
due for a. rally as evidenced at the opening
j-ad was reinforced Â£y some obvious nervous
rifsg on the rert of the shorts. The latter
flexrient covered freely in Northern Pacific and
there was a firm tendency in Sugar, the trunk
Mnes and Rea^lr.g first preferred, which served
&Â£ points of resistance to wpakntw. But the
crctlsued demoralization in Brooklyn Rapid
Trar.yit upfet the confidence of the bull ele

In -large volume before the end of the first

The market has been depr^peM dunns the

Rfnorts of railroad â¢arnints show a level
Â« ell above last year still maintained.. But the
tmlicr cf conservatism in dividend disburee
r> er.W now avowed by practically all railroad
managers, has prevented this from havlns
mod) effect on values.
The outlook in the iron trade is admitted to
b*- more favorable by conservative authorities,
the Iron Age voicing thÂ« impression that the
Â©Pir.io-n' Is eaininK ground that prices are down
pretty close to a basis which will bÂ« considered
fairly safe by consumers. This encouraging
view at the Iron market conditions Is partly
offset by the approach of the wage adjustment
I*riod which has in it the possibility of wlde
epread industrial unsfttleraent. .
There is an clement In Wall street which
nsea that the market Is due for a rally, owing
to the existence of a large shortage In wheat,
which would b* obliged to cover at any consid
erable advance In Krice*. This element points
to the fÂ»ct that price* of rcariy stocks have re
ceded now below the level touched in the panic
or Utt December and have therefore amply dis
ooutitto the unfavorable factors in the situa
tion.
An m-gressive leadership, they argue, would
rireeipitatt a bear panic. But the bull leader
hits not cfue to the front. The continued drib
Â¦bltng of liquidation into the market has shown
dearly eaaugh that holders of ttockr are in
clined to tell rather than to increase their
holdings. It Is alm0*t the Invariable sequence
of such a ranlc tr- that or last December that
prices, after a violent rally on bear covering,
during which those who bought to check the
panic realize thtir t iroQui lÂ»egi n to drift slowly

NEW YORK. June 23. â The Financier says:
As foreshadowed in this analysis last week the
loan movement, which has been an important
and Interesting feature nf the New York bank
statement for some w^eks past, has apparently
culminated. The Iran item for the six days
ju.Â«t ended remained practically stationary, a
slight advance of $2."i,90O contrasting: with the
averapp expansion of sevorat millions weekly
over the recent spring- season. The chief featujfi
of the current statement, howevnp, is tre
loss of ?3.16?.frC0 in cash, which is alpo re
flected In a decrease of M.787.S0Q in deposits.
It had l>pcn flsrurM that the loss sustained by
the banks on gold export requirements had
bwn practically counterbalanced by interior
receipts and. in fact, that the cash totals would
show a pain, but the official statement, made
on a system of averagps. show? otherwise.
Since May "S last thtÂ» banks have Increased
th^ir cash h<">Ming3 only nominally, while loans
have expanded seventeen millions and the
deposits over fourteen million. The rapid rise
of the loan mtal Is generally interpreted to
be due to investments in ptfrlircj? exchange,
and some estimates have placed the total of
such business at one hundred millions. It is
only fair to say. however, that no calculations
on this jj^int are to be relied upon. The anom
aly presented in New Ynrk within the last
week of money leaning en call at 1 per cent
while at the same time goM was being ex
ported to Europe cannot be expected to con
tinue much loneer. Already there is more
firmness noted in the local market and an
indisposition prevails to make loans over the
end of the year. If the precedents of the past
year are of value in forecasting the future
there will be a decline in the loan totals of
the banks very shortly. This continued flow
of money is attracting attention at present,
but domestic exchange rates, for all that, are
hardening at the mere important financial
centers The circulation of the banks is now
J2V.33.lS0 and is growing, despite the light de
mand locally Â»for funds. >.
Condition of the Treasury,
WASHINGTON, June 23.â To-day's statement
cf the Treasury balances In the general fund,
exclusive of the flSO.wO.COO gold reserve in the
division Pf redemption, shows: Available cash
balances, tM9.800.tS8; gold. J57.964.44L
Associated Banks' Statement.
wheat crop and uneasiness has increased re-
C&rding the cotton crop.
The effect of the Chinese Eituatlon on the
Stock Market has diminished to insignificance.
But the movement of money markets and the
ss-mi annual settlements to be met on July 1
are a erowiiiR source of apprehension in secur
ity market circles. Berlin has borroweJ heav-
J!y on capital for some time past, and this has
served to encroach on the surplus reserves of
New York banks by expanding the reserve re
quirements. TTils week Gtnnany has ana^u to
her demand for credits a call for bullion to
replenish her own banking reserves In prepara
tion for July 1. The Bank of France also con
tinues to accumulate . reserves and to reduce
note Issues and loans as though in preparation
for a storm. The result has been a stiffening
of discount rates In London and an advance of
one penny an ounce In the Bank of England's
price of gold bars and of American eagle?.
The large payments for pensions by the sub
treasury have tided over the situation at New
York this week. But th/Â» banks UÂ»ve to meet
fcext week a call for (S.00^000 of Government
deposits to be returned to the treasury and
afterward the demands incident to preparation
for the July 1 interest and dividend disburse
ments, with the prcsj-ect of a resumption of
interior demands for fund? to move the crops.
The active speculation in wheat also makes ad
ditional demands for loans. There Is not much
likelihood, however, of a pressure of idle funds
to stimulate a sluggish stock market.
The bond market has moved irregularly to
ward a. lower plane of prices.

The Â£ead body of Andrew Anderson was
tound yesterday forenoon In a well on
the grounds of the McLean Hospital. A
K>-ccnt piece and a silver watch were all
the ariicios of value found upon the per
son. There is no doubt that he commit
ted suicide.
When the clothing of the dead man was
searched at the Morgue tvro receipts -were
found, one for 5500 and another for 530,
given by a medical firm In ac
knowledgment of his payment to
rhera for treatment of an incurable dis
ease. Anderson, having quit the ad\ er- 
tlslr.g; 5m. had been a patient in the Mc-
Lecii Hospital from June 11 to Jur.e 17 of
tiiis year. The receipts are dated May 2G
and June 4. Xothing could be learned of
the dead man's antecedents. While in the
hospital he showed signs of mental aber
ration. The well in which the body was
found was about thirty feet distant from
a tank and windmill, near the corner of
Nineteer.th and Douglass streets. A two
inch pipe runs up from the center of the
tvtll and the pipe is braced with timbers.
There was just room enough between the
Timbers to admit of the passage of An

was suffering end penniless support the
theory of suicide. The body had been in
the water &bout two days.

Owners of lead mines are excited over
the great slump in prices. There has
been a drop of about JlS per ton. The low
est figure since December, 1893, has been
reached. It Is estimated that the loss to
the Cceur d'Alenes at the present rate
will amount to $l,46S,00O per annum. Own
ers and managers of load mines In Utah,
Montana, Colorado and Missouri have
been In conference to see what can be
done to restore the price. Not long ago
lead was quoted at $4 70 per 100 pounds.
Now It Is worth a dollar less per 100
pounds. Lead is quoted at Liverpool at
$3 60. The duty is $1 50 and cost or trans
portation 10 cents. There are several re
ports afloat concerning combinations to be
effected. One is that the Guggenheims
will bo absorbed by the smelter trust on
a basis of $35,000,009 cash, preferred stock,
and an additional bonus in common stock
to eliminate the Guggenheim competition.
A lead producers' association may come
into existence. That Is under considera
tion.
President B. F. Montgomery of the In
ternational Mining Congress at Milwaukee
offered several suggestions in his annual
address. He recommended a permanent
organization of the miners and an annual
meeting. He recommended revision of the
mining laws to have mining placed under
the jurisdiction of Congress exclusively,
eo that there shall be uniformity in
method of location, size of mining claims
and annual assessment work. He also
desired the abolition of "apex rights,"
and favoFed legislation to provide that
the area of a claim shall be circum
scribed by the surface lines drawn ver
tically downward. The establishment of
a national department of mines and min
ing was urged.
Judge Corland has decided in the Fed
eral Court at Kansas City in bankruptcy
proceedings that companies engaged prin
cipally in mining are not subject to the
bankruptcy law, as they are "not engaged
principally in manufacturing, publishing
or mercantile pursuits." as a section of
the law provides must be the occupation
of persons, companies or corporations to
be subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
The decision was rendered in the case of
the Victoria Zinc Mining Company of Oro
nogo, Mo. The company had installed a
new mill costing $72,000, the machinery
contractors being preferred creditors.
Other creditors attempted to force the
company into bankruptcy and defeat the
preferred claims of the machinery men.
A great deal in coal lands is under way
in Utah. The lands comprise eighteen
townships west of SaJt Lake City. They
make up a strip thirty-five miles long and
twenty miles wide. The parties reported
to be behind the deal are residents of St.
Louis. Engineers have Jbeen surveying
there.
The glories of Tombstone, Ariz., may be
revived, so says the Mchave County Min
er. The Tough Nut and Train Quality
mines are still running with a limited
force of men and produce by the new pro
cess paying quantities of gold and silver.
The decline of the camp can be dated
back about a decade, but many high
grade veins of copper and gold have been
located and developed since then. Ef
forts are being made to combine the
Tombstone mines under one management,
by which the now idle-lying properties
can be worked profitably. They are con
nected on the same level and the one
pump In the camp was formerly kept go
ing drawing water from all the mines at
the same time. Over a dispute as to pay
for this work the pump was stopped, the
mines became flooded and work had to be
abandoned and there the gold and silver
has laid ever since. To-day it will take.
It is asserted, a million dollars to
take the water out of these mines.
L. H. Carver contends that laying out
the work in a mine is not very difficult, if
only the matter in hand be treated intelli
gently. It is sometimes possible, he
writes to the Mining and Scientific Press,
from the configuration of the ground to
judge precisely where it can be opened to
the best advantage, but generally it is ad
visable to make a complete topographical
survey and map in order to spread the
exact conditions of the surface clearly, ac
curately and comprehensively before the
mind.
"With a complete topographical map be
fore one. It -would not be a difficult mat
ter to lay out the wqrk Intelligently," he
says. "Contour lines would show the dif
ferences of the slope as they approach
each other or lay further apart, and make
it possible to read off the elevations or
the difference of elevation of any points
instantly. They would be convenient also
In many instances to show just where the
ditch line would be located and its length,
in advance of actual survey and construc
tion, and equally advantageous in select
ing: the best point for a dump.
'"Comparison could be made between the
depth to bedrock in the shafts and the
outcropping at the rim, with dip and the
actual cross section established in some
cases. The area of the best 'pay' could be
as readily located and shown upon such
a map as are the shoals and channels on
the hydrographlc maps of the Govern
ment, and the location of the sluice boxes
could be determined to a certainty for any
desired gradient that would admit the
Erc-atpst possible dumping facilities.
"By simple measurement from an estab
lished base th<Â» record of the amount of
work for each month could be shown and
the amount of material moved accurate
ly computed. As it is not possible to ob
tain, in the first instance, a test of hy
draulic propositions under actual working
conditions, as !n quartz mining, much care
and attention is required to collect and
produce such information and data In
proper form, so that each step may be in
telligently worked out and thus reach a
combination that goes far to Insure a suc
cessful result when the true economic con
ditions are fully understood and appre
ciated." ,
A correspondent at Chloride. Ariz.,
writes that ten 1000-pound stamps have
been purcnased for the Merrimac mine,
making the equipment twenty stamps.
The Bbaft is COO feet deep and there is a
drift of 2.V* feet. The Tennessee mine is
sending' away four carloads of concen
trates wo^kly. The shaft in the Tennes
see is down nearly 700 feet. The drifting
amounts to 1000 feet. Mr. Rockford has
taken hold of th<? Blue Pod mine and the
shaft is down 70 feet. The contract is
let for sinking 200 feet through the ore
body. Thomas Ewlng, manager of the
ShÂ«>eptrail mine, keeps twenty stamps i
pounding incessantly. Thirty-five men
are working in Gracey's gold camp, near
Cattamora Island, on tho Colorado. The
building of a smelter at Needles for
the treatment of low-grade ore, which is
nearing completion, has caused many
owners of mines and(Claims to go to work.
The smelter's capacity will be 100 tons
every twp.nty-four hours. Rail rates have
been put at SI 25 per ton from any part
of Mohave County to help open up the
mine?.
The progress of consolidation of mining
properties at Crinnle Creek is marked.
The VTooos Investment Company, the
Stratton-Independence comblnaHon and
about ten others produce the great bulk
of ores in the district, and they have ac
quired large additional area in the district
during the past year. The June output
of the Cripple Creek district will be about
40,000 tons. The falling off Is in milling
orrs. rather than in smelting.
The output of metals in the State of
Washington last year amounted to {1.163 -
487 K6, distributed as follows: Gold, $729
?.S7: silver, $374,510; copper, $13,455; lead.
$4<U33. .
The Arnador Ledger says that drifting
still continues for the ledge at the Ama
dor King. Rock from the Lincoln mine
Is being crushed at a neighboring mill
and the result, is anxiously awaited by
the interested parties. The Kennedy, Ar
gonaut and Zeila mines are producing ana
work at the South Eureka is In full blast.
The Hobart Gold Mining Company has se
cured full control of the Spagnoll mine at
Clinton.
The Tuolumne Independent reports that
a pumping plant will be operated by wa
ter power at Bald Mountain, W. D
Plnkston of Butte, Mont., has put a force
of men to work In the Mount Hood mine
