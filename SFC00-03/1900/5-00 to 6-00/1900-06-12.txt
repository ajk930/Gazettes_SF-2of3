"It means that the Empress Dowager
has finally thrown off tho mask and has
resolved to stake everything on her antt
forelgn policy. Prince Tuan is a creature
of the Empress, who Is known to be ona
cf the chief patrons of the Boxers and a
representative cf the most reactionary
party In China. That she is a determined
and headstrong woman Is not to be-dis
puted. She has so far enjoyed Immunity,
which has -encouraged those qualities,
and, combined with her ignorance cf tho
forces she Is defying and with the malign
influence -of her entourage of eunuchs and
parasites, as Â¦we'll as placehunters. her
willfulness has induced her to offer
direct' challenge to the foreign powers.
The challenge Is one which they cannot
decline to take up If they must act, and
they mtrst act together, as. Indeed they
are doing. If the Empress is to have her
way, the position of no foreign power in
China will be vrorth a'month's purchase,
and Western civilization w!!l disappear
from the country altogether."

Boxer brotherhood."
The Times, commenting upon the reor
ganization of the Tsi:n?:-tl Yamen, consid
ers ita significance unmistakable and says:
"The conquest and division of China
would be possible with 100,000 troops, but
to retain the government would require
1.000,000 soldiers and centuries of work.
The task would end with the most un
happy results for both conquered and con*
queror. His Majesty and his advisers beg
America and Japan to pause before re
sorting to dismemberment, which can be
deferred at least until the Emperor's ef
forts to govern his people and restore the
happiness of this great division of the
human race have proved abortive. If the
people are assured that the powera are

not intend to swallow the country piece

being virtually non-existent the Emperor
proposes that the foreign powers whose
troops dominate the capital shall remove
his imperial person from the palace in
which his Majesty is confined a prisoner,
shall declare Empress Hsi Tsl and her
present ministers to be usurpers and shall
bring Emperor Kwanp Hsu to Nanking,
Wu Chang or Shanghai, whichever the
said foreign powers deem to be the most,
suitable situation for the capital of the

WASHINGTON, June 11.â The Navy Department received the following
cablegram from Admiral Kempff:
"TON*G ED, June 11.â Secretary Navy, Washington: In case all
communication with Peking cut, not able to go alone. If other nations go
will join to relieve Americans pending instructions. Situation serious.
Battalion of marines from Manila has been urgently requested. Answer.
"KEMPFF."
Upon receipt of the above Secretary Long sent the following cablegram to
Afimlral Remey at Mar.lla:
"NAVY DEPARTMENT, June 11.â Remey, Manila: Send by Solace immediately
t>y all dispatch to Kempff one hundred marines, arranging If practicable that
after landing Solace thall continue homeward voyage as previously ordered.
"LONG."
The following undated dispatch has been receiwd at the Navy Department:
"Secretary of the Navy: Forces landed by the different nations. Opening com
xnunication to Peking. Americans Joined. KEMPFF."
Admiral Kempff also reports the arrival of the Monocacy at Taku.
Minister Conger was heard from again this morning. It is fortunate that, al
though telegraphic communication between the foreign forces at Taku and Tien
tsin and foreign embassies and legations at Peking is interrupted through the
cutting of telegraph wires, there yet remains a channel of communication be
tween the officials at Peking and their home Governments by overland wires to
Jrhnnprhai and thence by cable. It is also possible through this roundabout way for
a connection to be maintained between the foreign diplomats and their naval
commanders at TaJtu.
Minister Conger's telegram was to the effect that the Pao Ting Fu mis
sionaries are pafe up to the present; that the Chinese Government has sent
trnopp thore and promises ample protection/ to the missions though it is not
thoupht that this protection will insure safety. According to Minister Conger
It i? impossible at this moment to send any foreign forces from Peking to Pao
Ting Fu. Mr. Cmijrcr"s doubt as to the permanence of the Chinese ability to
protect the missions is !n line with his previous expressions of opinion indicating
a bclipf in his mind that the few Chinese generals who are disposed to protect
foreipriers^sre to bo overcome by the element at the Chinese court which is fa
lorablc to the Boxers
The nttitude of the United States Government respecting the Boxer troubles
bavins beon misrepresented in certain quarters, it can be stated authoritatively
that Â«r> to this point not the first step has been taken, toward sending any troops
from General MacArthur's army in the Philippines to China. It was decided
last week that nonÂ« of the troops could be spared, even if wanted, and that none
â¢would be spared if they could be for such a purpose in the present aspect of the
Chinese trouble. - Â¦ i -_-.-
Mr. Conger askM for further Instructions and was directed to proceed with
energy in the protection of American interests and more especially with the pro
tr.rtir>n of "Me American legation and the lives of the 'American citizens in China.
Be v.ap warned, however, not to be a party to any alliance or combination of a
group of powers. He was to act Independently whenever this was practicable, al
tho;iRh he was not forbidden to take concurrent action with other diplomatic rep
resentatives if tudrlcn necessity should arise for It. He was to do nothing to
commit the United States* further action. The traditional policy of the United
State* in this rÂ«Â»ppoct was to be strictly observed.
The naval offleicJs say that the Nashville can scarcely reach Taku before Fri
day or Saturday next. Then the run up the shallow and rapid Peiho River- to
Tientsin will consume another day. The Yorktown and Cast'.ne, at Shanghai, are
rapidly being put into shape for sea. They were undergoing repairs, but this
work doubtless will be hastened so that if the conditions become more grave at
Tientsin one or both of the ships can reach there from Shanghai even before the
Nashville, arrives.
The Cnlnese crisis continues to be an absorbing topic at the' foreign em
hn?sks and legations In Â¦Washington, but the prevailing sentiment is that it will
be confined to mob outbreaks and will not eventuate in a territorial dismember
ment involving the various powers. It is pointed out that up to this time the foreign Â¦
powers have stated most positively that their sole purpose Is to restore order
nnd protect their citizens and property, and while then-- has been some suspicion
cf an ulterior motive on the part of some of them, this has not taken form.
On the contrary, all the official declarations have disavowed anything mon;
than a restoration of order. The Spanish Minister at Peking Is dean of the
diplomatic corps there, but as Spain has practically no interests iv China. Sir
Claudf MacdonaJd, who is second in paint of service to the Spanish Minister,
Â¦will act as dean during this upheaval, the other Minis-tors having interests, to
protect co-operating with him. That serious international entanglements are
not expected soon is indicated to some extent by the departure from this city of
the foreign representatives. /
The Russian Embassadnr, Count Cassinl, has already gone: EmbassarTbr
Catnbon of France will leave on the 20th inst. for r>urope, and Lord Pauncefote
Is making arrangements to go to Newport for the summer on July 1. At the
same time It is felt that China is in such a foment that an International crisis
beyond tho mob uprisings eonfinod to China may be precipitated at any moment.
The Chinese Minister, Wn Ting Fang, is naturally disturbed at the seriousness
of the reports, but in the complete absence of official information he believes the
reports are magnified and that the underlying causes of the attacks on the for
eigners have not been given. A knowledge of this point, ho feels, will permit a
much better judgment of the situation.
In some foreign quarters it has been thought the Chinese Government would
give indication through its Ministers abroad of Its views on the landing of for
eign troops and its ability unaided to cope with the situation, but not a word as
to this has been received here.
Secretary Long this afternoon stated that he nad sent no direct answer to
Admiral Kempff, nor was such an answer necessary In view of the subsequent
cablegram to Admiral Remey at Manila. The re-enforcements In the shape of
Jifi additional marines, which will come to him from Manila during the course
of a week, would indicate the department's position sufficiently. It will take the
Solace a full week to make the trip, according to the estimate of the naval offi
cers, for it is about 2(KiO miles from Manila to Taku. It is declared at the Navy
iJepartrnent that Admiral Kempff is not entirely dependent upon this marine
force from Manila for re-enforcements, for he was authorized last week to call
upon the United States naval vessels at Shanghai, the Yorktown and the Cas
tlne, for more men if he needed them, and it is suggested that the Oregon also
may supply another force in addition to 'the twenty marines she has sent al
ready to admiral Kempff. It is evident that the Navy Department approves all
Admiral Kempff has done up to this point at least, as Is shown by the disin
clination to hamper him by instructions. Â« __

a hundred miles of the marauding Boers north of Kroonstad. and they
are expected, of course, to make short work of them. Nevertheless, out
side of the War Office telegrams, no one knows what is going on. South,
of Kroonstad there is a wide gap. The railway is only partially defended
and as General Kelly-Kenny has hurried all the available troops northward the
assumption Js that there is danger of a second raid. The loss of the Derbyshires
is estimated at from 600 to TOO men.
A Reuter dispatch from Maseru,- dated June 11, 3:33 p. m., says: "Fifteen
hundred Boers surrendered to General Brabant to-day in the Flcksburff dis

Machadodorp has been officially proclaimed the capital of the Transvaal. A

the majority of the inhabitants living In tents.
An official Boer telegram asserts that the British have been defeated with con
siderable loss at Donkerspoort, in the southern extremity of the Free State, or
Orange_River Colony, ten mile3 from Norvals Pont. It was thought that tKis
district had been cleared of Boers and rebels long ago.
The Boers still cling to Lalngs Nek, but General BuIIer's forces are â¢working:
far around in that direction.
Lord Roberts has wired Cape Town that prior to Wednesday he liberated 131
officers and 3500 of the rank and file. The Boers consequently took off only 900.

cus called to consider the Ministerial programme. J. X. Merriam. Treasurer, and
J. W. Fauer. Commissioner of Public Works, have resigned from the Cabinet, and
Mr. Schreiner*s own resignation is believed to be imminent, although he may re

Sir Frederick Forestier- Walker, in com

South Africa, reports that in the disaster
to the British troops June 7 at Roodeval.
where the Boers cut Lord Roberts' line
of communications, the Fourth Battalion
of the Derbyshire Regiment were all
killed, wounded or made prisoners, except
six enlisted men. Two officers and fifteen
men were killed and five^offlcers and
seventy-two men were wounded, many of
them severely. The Boers returned the
wounded to the British.
The officers killed were: Lieutenant
Colonel Balrd-Douglass and Lieutenant
Hawley.
The wounded include Colonel Wilkinson
and Lieutenant Blanchard of the Cana-

So Devastating Has Been ths Cholera
Outbreak That Relief Camps
Are Powerless.
LONDON', June 12. â The famine in India
grows worse. The Standard's Simla cor
respondent, in a mail letter, says: .
"It would be rash to assume from tho
almost stationary relief figures that the
corner will soon be turned. So devastating
has been the cholera outbreak, so numer
ous the mortality and so blind the terror
inspired by this black death that the fam
ine relief camps in Bombay presidency,
which contained thousands of workers,
melt away and are left empty in the
courpe of a couple of days.
"Starving though they be, they prefer
to fly to their own home and to die ln
quiet, rather than to remain in the famine
relief camns, where tho cholera Is strik
ing down a hundred workers daily.
"Terrible stories come from Dohad.
There the famine Is at its worst and now
the cholera has arrived to complete the
f.ork. An eyewitness says:
" 'As we walked through these quiet
streets we saw deserted homes and dead
bodies. One of the bravest acts witnessed
was a little girl about seven attempting to
care for two little brothers after the
mother had given up all hope and lain
down near them to die. She was feeding
a fire which burned beneath a broken pot,
in which simmered the almost rotten feet
and bones of fome dead animal. Tho scene
cannot be painted too black. No account
we have ever read of any famine would
picture the state of affairs at Dohad. 1 "
The Standard's correspondent says the
mortality estimates are Inaccurate, as
unnumbered, dead bodies are polluting the
streams and spreading contagion.

HORRORS OF THE INDIAN
FAMINE INDESCRIBABLE
. WASHINGTON, June 11.â Major Gen
eral E. S. Otis, accompanied by his aids.
Captain Slayden and Lieutenant Stanley,
reached Washington this morning. He
was met at the station by Adjutant Gen
eral Corbln and General Schwann, and
the party were driven directly. to the Ar
lington Hotel. After breakfasting Gen
eral Otis repaired to the War Depart
ment, where he formally reported to
Mr. Meiklejohn, as acting Secretary.
Thence General Corbin escorted him and
his aids to the White House. The Presi
dent was in his private office in close
consultation with Senator Allison, Sena
tor Cullom and Justice Harlan when the
party arrived. General Otis and General
Corbin were immediately ushered into the
Presidential library, where Mr. McKln-
Icy met General v-tls with the utmost
cordiality, congratulating him upon his
apparent good health, and thanking him
several times for -is signal services to
the country.
General Otis made -no report : to- the
President in detail. After a few min
utes the President Invited General Otis
into his office and presented him to Sen
ators Allison and Cuiiom and Justice
Harlan, and for over half an hour Gen
eral Otis remained talking over the situ
ation in the Philippines.
The President and his visitors were in
tensely Interested in what the general
had to say and with his opinion of the
rxistlng situation in the archipelago. Af
ter General Otis left the White House
he was naturally reticent concerning the
subject of his interview with the Presi
dent, but he did not hesitate to reiterate
his statement, made repeatedly since
landing at San Francisco, that the Fili
pino rebellion as an organization was
dead. When his attention was called to
thÂ« views of Judpe Taft, president of the
Philippine Commission, in the Manila
dispatches printed this morning, he ex
pressed the opinion that they were satis
factory. The United States would be
compelled to maintain in the Philippines
for a considerable period as large an army
ab was there at present.
"The army," said he, "will be needed
as a measure of repression until the rob
bers and guerrillas are stamped out. -The
maintenance of this large force Is neces
sary owing to the vast extent of terri
tory which we must cover. We have es
tablished ourselves In Negros, Cebu, Sa
mar and many of the other islands. In
addition to Luzon, and I are to-day
actually exercising effective authority
over more territory than Spain ever did."
General Otis said practically all the
leaders of the Insurgents were cither
dead, captured or pacified. . The* recent
rapture of General Pilar del Rio. - he
thought, had probably been effected with
the consent of that general. So far as
Aguinaldo himself was concerned, Gen
eral Otis was not inclined to credit the
report of his death. In his opinion it
mattered little, however, , -whether Aguin
aldo was deadl or. alive, as his Influence
had been completely destroyed.
"Agulnaldo," he said, "is probably In
hiding somewhere , ln the mountains - of
Northern Luzon, but Â¦ he carries little
more influence than any other Individual

at large. He Is discredited and a dead
issue."
Asked as to whether in the event of
more acute complications in China troop.s
could be spared from the Philippines for
service there. General Otis replied: j
"Possibly, poBslblv."
General Otis left to-night for West
Point, whero he will report In per
pon to Secretary Root. Ho is entirely
In the dark as to his future assignment
to duty. He will remain at West Point
with the Secretary until after the gradu
ating exercirfes are over and will return to
Washington with the Secretary, arriving
here on Thursday morning, when he will
again call on the President and make a
report in detail of the operations of the
army under his command, and submit
such suggestions and recommendations
as shnll seem to him proper. He will
leave here again Thursday night for his
old home at Rochester, where extensive
preparations arÂ« being made to celebrate
his homecoming on Friday.

ARRAIGNS THE
PLUTOCRACY OF
THE COUNTRY
ST. LOUIS. June 11.â The Sabbaths
scenes of disorder and bloodshed were
followed to-day by comparative quiet
throughout the city. Last night's riot
was the all-absorbing topic, especially
among .the police force and the officers
and men of the Sheriff's posse comitatus.
They discussed it in all its bearings, the
opinion being expressed that the posse
men had done their full duty and no more.
The strikers and their sympathizers,
naturally, viewed the occurrence . ln a
light diametrically opposite to that of the
Sheriff's posse, the officials of the former
making the claim that the men were shot
down in cold blood.
Cars were operated until midnight to
night an the following lines?: Laclede
avenue. Market street, Olive street,
Washington avenue, Compton Heights
and Park avenue. L"p to a late hour no
reports of disorders had been received by
the board of police.' ' The surveillance of
the Police Department was not relaxed
in the least as compared with the preced
ing days of the strike. If anything their
efforts were redoubled in maintaining
peace and order; as in some quarters It
was feared the lawless element of the
community might po'ssibly take measures
to even up yesterday's score, when three
striking employes were killed and nine
persons Injured by the posse. In the same
degree the two regiments of the posae
were on their mettle.
In answer tp a letter directed by Chief
of Police Campbell this evening to Mayor
Zeigenhein, the following proclamation
was Issued by the latter:
Whereas. During the pendency of th? present
railway strike and the crisis through which
the city is now passing, it is of thÂ» utmost
importance that all exeitÂ»ment be suppressed
snd that no aets of any kind be done which
may tend to produce or create excitement In
public places, such as the [ assembling of
crowds or groups of persons upoii the streets.
the discussion of the situation In boisterous
language or the discharge of firearms or lire- :
works. (
Therefore, I. the undersigned. Mayor of the
city of St. Ixmls. by virtue or the power and
authority In me vested by law, Jo hereby
proclaim and direct that all persons ln the
city of St. I^ouls refrain from gathering In 'Â¦
numbers on the public streets or in public [
places: that all persons, particularly women
and children, remain Indoors as much as
possible until the present situation Is re
lieved; that JÂ«>orirs or abusive language or
language calculated to provoke a breach of the
peace b? not Indulced In.
And all persons are especially warned apain-'t
the discharge, within the city limits, of fire
arnjp of any description, and agninst the fir
ing or exploding of bombs, torpedoes, fire
crackers or any species of fireworks.
All minors are warned to k(Â»ep within doors
riurinc the rext three days, and parents are
notified that all minors found out of doors
between onÂ»- hour after sunset and one hour
before sunr'.fe are subject to arrest and irn-
Urisonment under the provisions of section 2139
of the revised Ftatutes of Missouri of 1S93.
HENRY 7.HIUENHEIN, Mayor.
President Harry B. Hawes of the police
board saÂ»<* to-night mat the Mayors
proclamation would be rigidly enforced.
JEFFKRSON- CITY. *o.. June" 11.;-
Oovernor Siephens to-day gave - out the
following statement, which he had wired
to the New York World, regarding the St.
Louis strike:
Rer-lvlng to your telegram, just received. I
w 11 say vigorous artlon rms heen taken by the
State government and St. Louis Police Depart
ment to enforce respect for law In St. Lf>"Â»s
"nil reÂ«rect for property. The Republican
Minor however, who is a candidate for renomi
natlon' not des-iring to offend, positively re
runs to co-onerate with us. which lends en
â¢â¢ouraeemrnt to the lawless element and lm
i.rdes our progrefs toward restoration of normal
conditions. The presW-nt of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners writes me under date of tne
7th Inst. rs follows: '
"Henry Zelgenhtiii. Mayor of St. Louis, has
persistently re'iised to attend the meetings of
the Police" Hoard, of which he is a member, or
to clve vs assistance of any kind at this criti
cal period. His Honor, In spite of sundry re
ouests, has persistently refused to assist the
board ln any way and it Is the belief that the
failure to do fo has worked harm to uÂ» in
this crisis. Especially do I deplore the fact,
as president of the Police Board, that he re
fused to issue the proper proclamation to f Keep
the peace' and for t'ie dispersing of mobs.
\Â«i Governor I have conscientiously and fear
leibly done my duty as my judgment directed.
I have requested that 2'00 urgency policemen
be Kworn in and that the Sheriff summon a
posse of 2.-.00 able-bodied and law-abiding citi
zens to serve under the direction of the Police
Commissioner*. It has not been deemed neces
sary up to this hour by the commissioners to
oroVr out the militia, the commissioners be
lieving that they are e.jual to the emergency.
There are only spasmodic outbreaks, which the
police and deputy sheriffs have been able to
manage. The stripping of the women to which
you refer was done'ny three KlrU between the
aees of 14 and 16. A saloon-keeper was also
arrested on B uspiclon of belns implicated. It
was not thousht best to order out the militia
to Khoot them.
The Eirls have been tried and sentenced to
terms in the Industrial homes for girls. Most
of <he newspapers In St. Louis endeavor to
stand In with the lawless element as wp!1 aa
with the better element and think it popular
to withhold support from State officers and
constantly criticise any act of the police au
thorities.
A similar strike upon the street railways was
ordered in Kansas City about the same time
the ft Louis strike was ordered, but proved n
failure' because the Mayor, the newspapers and
the Sheriff all co-operated with the Police De
partment. .
We have, four regiments in Missouri, consist
ing altnsether of about 2J00 men. The first
regiment, with two hours' notice, will be ready
for duty. The other three regiments can be
mobilized In St. Louis within ten hours. Camp
injr sites have been selected in the city and
details all arranged and an soon as I am in
formed by the proper authorities that a tumult
existR in the citv and that a condition of law
1<tfi>p!-s and disorder prevails with which the
civil authorities are unable to cope, then the
National Guard will ne called out to preserve
order ami prevent further disorder and acts
of violence without delay.
Conditions are indeed bad Â»nou;rV>. but ex
aggerated reports' have reached the KaÂ«t. I
feel the worst Is over. It was <*."Â»monstrat<Â»<l
in St. Louis when four or five strikers were
nhpt and killed that our authorities mean busi
ness. I believe that law and ordT will soin
bp restored and the good name of St. LouU and
the State will be preserved. Ninety per cent
of the rood people indorse my action since th-*
strike was declared and oppose the calling out
of the militia until St. Louis admits, even with
her police force and unlimited number of dep
uty sherlffE. she cannot at this time take care

BERLIN, June 11.â From a high official
cf the Foreign Office the correspondent
cf the Associated Press received the fol
lowing statement to-day respecting Ger
many's attitude in the Far East:
"Germany adheres to her idea of joint
action by the powers in China. Thus far
the powers have been acting together
harmoniously, and there is no indication
that any power means to take a separate
advantage. The German Foreign Office
lias received no official proof, nor any
evidence tending to show that the Era
press* DowageY is martins common cause
with the Boxers. Indeed, Baron von Ket
taler, German Minister in Peking, not
long ago forwarded a copy of an Imperial
decree against the Boxers. It is another
question, of course, whether the EmpreÂ«s
uses adequate means for suppressing the
revolt, and also whetner within her Im
mediate entourage anti-European influ
ences are at work. .
"The instructions that have . been sent
to the chief -Â«f the German squadron, Ad
miral von Bendemann. are comprehensive
enough-: to .-meet -the requirements of the
case. If necessary a' third marine bat
talion will be dispatched ' from Kiaochau
to Peking, but no more ships.'-'
United States Embassador White says
that the only question now pending be
tween the embassy and the German For
eign Office is the negotiations regarding
the jurisdiction of the United States Con
sul at Kiaocbau and in the German sphere
of influence. The matter presents: some
features of Interest, because the Consuls
have hitherto had extraterritorial Juris
diction, as in barbaric lands. .The purpose
of.the negotiations, which are proceeding
eatisf actorily , is to modify; ; the : jurisdic
tion so as to suit the new conditions.

The Foreign Minister also said that

subsiding, the agitation had redoubled
and the French Consul had been com

Delegates Called to Order in California Hall by President
Donovanâ Unusual Large Attendance
C\ AKLAND, June 11.â The biennial
\] State convention of the Ancient
/ Order of Hibernians assembled this
afternoon at California Hall, where
a welcome to the many visiting delegates
was extended by the divisions of Alameda
County. The attendance was large, a
fact commented upon by several speak
ers as savoring well for the organization.
The Alameda County members have ar
ranged ' much entertainment, for their
guests during the, convention.
There is a great* deal of work mapped
out for the committees, and this, together
\tllh the various contests that are on for
State officers, lends more than routine in
terest to the proceedings.
State President J. J. Donovan called the
convention to order at 1 o'clock. Rev. D.
O. Crowley, .State chaplain, offered pray
er, after which President Donovan" deliv
ered an address. He commented upon the
large numberof delegates in attendance
and the manifest zeal they were exhibit
ing in the work of the order. N He believed
the presence of so many members
auguiod well. The president made special
reference to the Alameda County divisions
Hr.d extended the thanks of the conven
tion to them for the admirable arrange
ments which had been made for the com
fort and entertainment of the convention
delegates.
Prank McAllister of. Oakland was ap
pointed sergeant-at-arms.
Father Crowley Makes an Address.
Upon solicitation Chaplain Crowley ad
dressed the convention with: "In the
name of the Rev. Michael King, in whose
parish the convention is assembled, I
bid you welcome to Oakland."
He continued - with a reminder to the
delegates of their duties, referring to the
objects of the order and urging them to
live up to the aims of the organization.
Continuing he said:
"The past of the order has been a glori
ous one, but the future demands even
more. We must in California look for
ward to the upbuilding of this organiza
tion that it may strengthen as in the East,
where it numbers more than 1*00,000 mem
bers.
"No other Irish-American society in the
United States possesses such old and glo
rious traditions. In the days of religious
persecutions our predecessors were the de
fenders of the old faith, when the Eng
lish Government set the same price on the
wolf and the priest.
"In our own glorious country, where lib
erty of conscience is guaranteed to all,
our society has a twofold mission. It
must be strenuous in its efforts to uphold
and perpetuate our free institutions and
to aid and succor our more needy and less
fortunate members. Unity, harmony und
charity should mark the proceedings of
the convention."
Talks by Other Delegates.
Addresses were also delivered by Rev.
J. B. McNally of West Oakland; Thomas
Hickey. orator of St. Patrick's day; ex-

Says the Cuban Atmosphere as to
Public Service Is One of Lies
and Deceptions.
WASHINGTON, June n.â General Lud
low. formerly Governor of Havana, . ha?
made a report to the War Department
denying the recently published statement
directly charging Brigadier Surgeon .Ma
jor Davis with having accepted bribes to
influence his official action while acting
as sanitary officer of the city of Havana.
The geaeral's opinion is shown by the fol
lowing Ixtract from hi3 report:
The Cuban atmosphere ns to the public service
is one of !l*s and -deceptions; accusations are
many and proofs are few; but seldom can the
actual fact3 be obtained and verified. Feople
will cay almo.u anything, but will refuse to
glfcn a statement or be sworn to it. In partic
ular are fome of the newspapers void of verity
or virtue. Most nf them serve personal Inter

ZUMWALT'S VICTIMS
ARE LAID TO REST
Mother, Son and Infant Grandchild
Buried in the Sams
Grave.
Special Dispatch to The Call
PLACERVILLE. June 11.â The funeral
of Mrs. Julia A. Zumwalt, George Zum
walt, her son, and the infant daughter of
George Zumwalt, the victims of last
Thursday night's fearful tragedy, took
place at the residence of the late George
Zumwalt. near Diamond Springs. Citi
zens of this city who have resided here
since pioneer days say that without doubt
the attendance was the largest of any
funeral ever heid in the county.
The services were conducted by Rev.
C..C. Pierce, who delivered an impressive
sefmon. All three were burled In the same
grave. The baby daughter was placed in
the same casket vrith the father, the child
resting on his armâ a pathetic sight that
moved nearly every one in the large as
semblage to tears. The caskets were cov
ered and surrounded by hundreds of beau
tiful floral pieces brought by hosts of
jsympathizing friends.
Zumwalt has retained ex-District Attor
ney Prentiss Carpenter of this city to de
fend him. He has been claiming since his
incarceration in the County Jail in this
city to have J1C0O in coin and gold dust
buried near his formrr homo. To-day
Deputy Sheriffs Houx and MUly, accom
panied by two of Zumwalt's tons, took
him out to the scene of the tragedy. On
arriving- at the place Zumwalt became
greatly excited, and either because insane
or feigned insanity, making no effort to
unearth his burled treasure, he was
brought back and placed in the steel cage
where he has been confined since the night
of the tragedy. It is thought here that
without doubt the defense made in his be
half will be insanity.

takes place to-night, which,
if weather conditions are fa

The phenomenon is of little /

Chinese riot at the sight of
coffins.
Board of Health decides to

days from the* last case.
Six Companies' physicians
nay make autopsies.
vâr-ilLE spirit of unrest that has been j
growing in Chinatown broke out In j
an incipient riot last even'r.?. and it ;
was not until policemen charged the I
crowds with clubs that the cnruly Slon-
Cc'lans were content to remain quiet.
The cause of the rict was an attempt to
get a lead of coffins through the lines to
an undertaking establishment on Sacra
mento street, just wÂ«t of Dupont. kept
by Wor.g Tong. The cart carrying the
coffins drove up to the line at Washing
ton ar.d KearTiV streets, and as soon as the \
Chinese inride learned what the load was
they gathered from every side and
blocked the street to prevent the wagon's j
passage. They declared by gesture and in j
vehement Chinese that the coffins should j
never be permitted to enter Chinatown.
As there were over two hundred angry j
Mongolians in the crowd the driver of the i
wagon turned his horses away and s.-mpht Â¦
for an opening elsewhere, while the Chi
nese, convinced that they had frightened I
him away, hung- around the corner and j
talked earnestly among themselves. When {
they learned, however, that the wagon ;
Â¦with its gTfcwsome load had entered the i
quarantined section by another way they !
set off up the street, heading for the un- !
dertaker's shop, where they knew the cof- J
fins were goir.g. The wagon was standing j
outside the place and the crowd fell upon {
it. and dumped the colSns into the street. I
Then, not content with the wreck of the
coffins, they entered the shop and pro
ceeded to wreck that aJso. They tore out
Â«11 the hangings, throw the furniture into !
the street axid broke up everything they
could lay their liar:ds on.
Police S'cring Clubs.
In the rr.eartirro word was sent to the
central station that There was trouble in
Chinatown and Cap:&!:i Witt man hurried i
down there. He took tr.rce men and a_ '

<Ired in the crowd by the time the police ;
arrived, but they went In with tiuir j
clubs poing ar.d with no lost time. The j
Chinese scattered in every direction, but '
the police pursued them as far as they j
were a.b!e and within a few minutes the |
street was clear. Then Lhe police hurried j
dawn to the corner cf Washington a:id [
Kearny streets, where part of the crowd j
that originally K&ihertu thorc still re
mained, i-f-fl Uxl* they smttere-d as they
had scattered the crowd on Sacramento j
FtreeL Heads were not spared nor was
f^trer.gth and there was many an aching j
head s*e'kir.g a soft pt.iow hi Chinatown
iiie police were unusually severe, but
the ca.se demanded it. Rioting, under the
strained conditions that exist in China
town just now. cannot be permitted and
the police have decided to spare no one
who is caught making trouble. Every
thing Js favorable to the brewing of
trouble inside the quarantine lines, and
the special police are not considered able
to do anything in the face of it. Out
breaks are likely to occur at any time,
and the police will work on the theory
that to attack the crowds? vigorously as
scon as they form is the only way to pre
vent serious happenings. It was ex
plained that the Chinese did not want to
see the coffins come in because they
feared it would lead to the report that
deaths were numerous. - Â¦
The End in Sight.
There is an end in sight, however, for
the Board of Health has decided that in
twenty days from the verification of the
last case the quarantine will be raised.
The following resolution was adopted by
the board yesterday:
Jtesoived. That It Is the sense of this Board
of Health thai the jlag-ue quarantine at present
in force in that section of the city and county
known as Chinatown be CitccnUnued and ter
minated on the twentieth day from and after
the verification of the la.Â«t ascertained casÂ».
this board reserving, however, the right to con
tinue fuch quarantine as long aa the disoo\ery
or fresh cases may make the same necessary or
exp.?i'.ier.t.
It was Introduced very gingerly and
onlv after a report by Dr. Chalmers, the
chief sanitary inspector, had been called
for. The scant business cf the meeting
having been attended to, the doctors
waited expectantly for something to hap
pen.
"I think we might have a report from
Dr. Chalmers on the condition of the
quarantined section," remarked Dr. Wil
liamson, apropos of nothing and forget
ting the fact that a report of Dr. Chal
mers' had just been reaa.
"Yes. let us have a report," seconded
several of the physicians, and Dr. Chal
mers rose and told what a clean place
Chinatown was getting to be.
"It is improving from day to day?" sug
gested Dr. Williamson.
"Tea," said Mr. Chalmers.
"And the work is nearly done?" ven
tured Dr. Buckley.
"It will be done in four days," replied
Dr. Chalmers.
"And thcrre are no suspicious cases?"
put in Chief Kullivan.
"Xc, there are r.one." answered Dr.
Chalmers and then Dr. Buckley, the
foundation having been laid, offered h!s
resolution, saying. "Then in pursuance of
Dr. CtutlmcTB* report 1 offer the following
resolution," ju=t as if Dr. Chalmers' re
port was a complete surprise to him and
made nil the difference in the v.orld. â¢
The last care was a Chinese drug clerk,
Trho di*>d a week ago Saturday. His case
was reported as being the plague on Sun
clay at the board meeting and the next
day Monday, it was reported to the board
thai the diagnosis had been verified. This
moans that if there be no further case the
quarantine will be raised on Sunday. June
24. that 1Â« if it be not Knocked out sooner
by the Federal court.
Restraining Order Extended.
It received somewhat of a Vlow yester
day frcm Judge Morrow: not the quaran
tine, but one of Its collateral issues. There
is a temporary restraining order. that .pre
vents the Board of Health from keeping
the physicians of the Six Companies out
side the lines, and on motion of the at
torrioys for ihe Chinese this order waa
extended to prevent the Â¦Uoard of Health
from interfering with those physicians
when they wish to make un autopsy on
ar.y patient th<Â»y have been caring for
nas Dren denied tnem.
Governor Gage has not yet made his re
port to Secretary Hay. but it will be In
before long. He has been in constant cor
respondence with Washington in regard
to the situation, and it seems evident that
the Federal authorities are taking a deep
interest in the condition of things out
here.
In dispatches of last evening It was re
ported that the Chinese Minister in Wash
ington had submitted a claim to the Gov
ernment demanding $.T\000 a day for every
day that the quarantine had been on- in
Chinatown of this city. Ho Yow, the Chi
nese Consul in this city, denies the etory.
He said last night that he had advices
from Washington in regard to the report,
and they Informed him that no such claim
had been made and he did not believe any
such claim would be made. Governor
Gage was asked if he had heard of any
action of the kind on the part of the Chi
nese Minister, but he would not discuss
the subject.
MINISTERS ASK THAT
QUARANTINE BE RAISED
Clergymen of All Denominations
Petition the. Board of Health to
That Effect.
A committee consisting of Rev. Dr. Xeed
ham and Rev. W. M. Woodward appeared
before the Board of Health yesterday af
ternoon and submitted resolutions asking
that body to raise the general Quarantine
in Chinatown and simply place a quaran
tine aroum. .louses wherein the disease is
said to exist. The resolutions were first
adopted yesterday morning at the meeting
of the Methodist Episcopal ministers and
later indorsed at the meeting of the min
isterial quarantine committee, which is
composed of clergymen of different de
nominations.
Rev. Dr. Bovard's work In Chinatown
was highly commended at' the meeting.
In a short talk which he delivered to the
assembled ministers Dr. Bovard told of
the intense feeling which existed in Chl
natotvn because or the enforced imprison
ment of the Celestials. He feared that it
v.ould eventually result in riot. He de
plored the fact that the business of 10,000
Chinese was paralyzed and he called on
the ministers to exert their influence to
j have the Board of Health raise the quar
antine. The speaker also called attention
I to the fact that rations were distributed
j to -HA) Chinese and that nearly 500 others

causc it would be of vast benefit to all

keeping everybody busy. But we want it
mainly because Salvador has no ports on
the Atlantic. With a canal opened our

We use- American machinery, tools and
agricultural implements, preferring them
to all other makes, and are getting them

SAN HAFAEL. June U.â Edward Wat
pon had a. narrow escape from serious In
jury at th? hands of infuriated Chinamen
nt the shrimp fisheries at Point San Pe
dro. Watson is taking the census of the
Chinese cajnps in that vicinity and the
Chinamen mistook him for a quarantine
efflcer. Some practical Joker had been
telling the Chinese that the Government
va_Â« golr.g to quarantine the fisheries.
This exasperated the Mongolians, and
â¢when Watson came along asking quep
tior.s and wearing his badge the popula
tion of the camp swarmed about him In a
threatening manner.
Watson saw his danger and made, an
effort to escape. He had left a saddle
horse a short distance from the camp and
taking to his heels he ran in that direc
tion. A band of fully 2'fl infuriated Celes
tials followed him. and it wns only by
<lint of th? hardest sprinting that the
census taJcer reached his horse and gal
loped at top speed to San Rafael.
Watson Is now looking for an interpre
ter tn po among the Chinamen and ex
plain his mission. He hopes in this way
to peoure the rei urns without further rlsk-
Ir.g hts life. Only a short time ago a body
of etudents picnicking in the vicinity
were mistaken for health inspectors by
the Chinamen, who armed themselves and
prepared for resistance. The students
â¢were warned to keep away from the vi
cinity, un4 by doing so avoided a conflict.

MINNEAPOLIS. June 1Lâ Word was re
ceived in Minneapolis to-day that there
was danger of another Indian uprising at
Leech Lake. An Indian giving the name
of Way-Tay-Gonce appeared at the Leech
Lake agency recently and announced that
he was the messlah. He said that all of
his descendants. Indians and white men,
who lived in houses -were soon to be de
stroyed by a big cyclone, but all Indians
who lived in tepees would be saved.
The man secured the confidence of many
of the Indians, who had such faith in
him that about two hundred left the
agency and went Into camp on Squaw
Point- â¢ The matter gradually grew so
serious that Captain Mercer, the Indian
agent, sent out and had Way-Tay-Gonce
arrested.
The other Indians remain on Squaw
Point and are becoming ugly. They make
many threats and as there are no troops
at the agency trouble Is feared.
FIRE VOLLEYS TO QUELL
REVOLT OF PRISONERS
Inmates of the Penitentiary at San

Means.
BAN JUAN. Porto Rico. June 11.â Five
hundred Inmates of the penitentiary here
mutinied to-day, refusing to take break
fast or work. They asserted that the food
was not fit to eat and the leader struck
thp warden In the face.
The penitentiary Is guarded by a de
tachment of twenty members of the Porto
Rico regiment, and the jail authorities,
fearing that the convicts had planned a
concerted movement to break jail, called
In the guard. Thereupon the prisoners
attempted to rush the troops, who fired
three volleys at the wall or in the air.
Three of the inmates were injured by
splinters, though not seriously.
The military authorities then called out
a company of regulars. This assistance,
however, was not asked for by the civil
authorities, and the native company had
quelled the disturbance before the reg

TROUBLES OF THE STAFF.
General de lanne of France With

PARIS June 11.â It is officially an
nounced that General de Lanne, chief of
the staff of the Ministry of War, tendered
his resignation, but at th^ request of Gen
eral Andre he withdrew it and will retain
the direction of the general staff.
Semi-offlcially it is explained that sever
al changes In the personnel of the War
Office were interpreted, by General de
Lanne as implying censure upon him and
he therefore resigned, but on General
Andre assuring him that he retained the
confidence 'of the Government General de
lanni canceled his resignation.
The report that General Jamont, Mili
tary Governor of Paris, intends to resign
is declared to be quite unfounded.

After a full discussion it concluded that
Chief Elton Is not responsible in view of
the conduct of the Police Commission;
that politics should have no place in the
management of the board, and that the
present Police Commission ought to be re

MILWAUKEE, Wls.. June 11.â Former
Governor George "\V. Peck was to-night
nominated for Congress by the Democrats
of the Fourth District.
SEATTLE, June 11.â According to let
ters just received from Behring Sea the
Alpha sailed on her second voyage from
Dutch Harbor May 9, but the reports of
her having gotten through the ice are
not believed, for the reason that the
schooner Annie returned to Unalaska on
May 18, nine days after the Alpha sailed,
with the news that ice was met with 300
miles north. It is hardly likely that a
clear break could be found extending as
far as Is'ome.
Serious fears for the Alpha's safety are
expressed at Unalaska and Dutch Harbor.
The Intrepid captain announced that he
would lÂ»e the first at Nome if he had to
haul his vessel on the ice. Consequently
those who are still waiting for the Ice to
go think that there is a liKelihood of the
vessel bt\ng caught in the ice pack, which
would purely occur, it is said, if the cap
tain tried to push through one of .the
lanes of clear water, wKich are always
i.i. .h1 in the Bering Sea floes. These,
while at times open as far as the eye can
penetrate, are continually closing to
gether, in which case any vessel which
ia unlucky enough to set caught is
crushed li^e an egrcshell.
The captain of the brig Pitcairn, which
sailed from San FranciÂ«co early in the
year, has been deposed and the lirst mate
of the vessel substituted. . Gleanings of
much trouble aboard the vessel have
reached hero previously, but it now ap
pears that the question finally proved to
be a very serious one. The passengers
virtually commanded the vessel.

Beauty is made or marred by the blood.
When the blood is impure, the cheeks
grow sallow, the eyes dull, the hair loses
its luster. When the blood flows through
the veins in a pure, rich current, the
eyes sparkle, the skin is clear, the com-
plexion beautiful." Women who use Dr.

that it is a genuine beautifier. By puri-

bloom on the cheek and a brightness in
the eye, which tell the story of perfect

"Having been. left weak from fever last Oc-
tober, I was under the doctor's care here," writes
Mrs. Alice E. Casebier, of Crawford, Dawes Co.,
Neb. "I took medicine, but did not seem to
gain very much. I was tired all the time, had
no appetite, had wandering pains all over me
more or less, and was very nervous, as I had
been sick all the summer. I was all run-down
nnd didn't know what ailed me. I grot advice
from Dr. Pierce, telling me my symptoms better
than /could describe them myself, and also telling
; . me that I would have to take care of myself, and
how to take the medicines. Â¦ I took four bottles
of 'Golden Medical Discovery,' and five of ' Fa-
vorite Prescription,' and gained strength right
along. I took one bottle of the ' Pleasant Pel-

all that they are recommended to do.";.

Representative Marion de Vrles of Cali

by the failure of the Senate to confirm tho

There i3 no question as to the Democ

therefore, be no doubt as to his confirma

Mr. de Vrles is now the only Democratic
Representative from the Pacific Coast.
His district 13 normally . Republican by
about 6000 and he is said to be the only
Democrat who can carry It.
Mr. de Vries will accept the appoint
ment and resign his seat in Congress. He
said to-day that he expected to take his
place as a member of the board in about
three months and that his successor in
the House, both for the short and the
long-term, would be chosen at the regu
lar election in November.
The President to-day assured Mr. de
Vries of the great gratification with
which he had heard from the public men
of all parties with whom he had con
sulted only words of praise regarding
him and said he made the appointment
with peculiar pleasure, especially as the
Pacific Coast was without a representa
tive on the board of general appraisers.
The. place carries a salary or $7300 per
year and is held during good behavior. It
is one of the most desirable positions In
the gift of the President.
Mr. de Vrles feels especially honored by
the fact that he made no application for
the place, but was strongly recommended
to the President by the Pacific Coast dele
gation in Congress and by prominent and
Influential Democrats and Republicans
throughout the country.
Among the few Senators and Represen
tatives still in the city there Is only the
highest commendation of the appointment
and Mr. de Vries Is receiving numerous
congratulations upon his good fortune.

BUTTE. Mont.. June 11.â In Silver Bow
County the old Democratic feud resulted
to-day in a split between . the Daly 'and
Clark people and two county conventions,
each of which will send delegations. to the
State Convention. The Daly people had
the party organization and a majority
of the Â¦. regularly returned delegates. The
Clark people contested in a number of
the precincts. The Daly people contested
but one precinct. In this the Clark dele
gation was seated.
Upon the announcement of the result
the Clark delegates and . the contestants
left the convention hall and organized a
separate -convention. The Daly people
continued in session, elected delegates and
in their platform condemned the methods
alleged to have beea pursued by the Clark
people. The" Clark convention made a
temporary organization and adjourned un

OFFICERS TO SERVE AT
THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS
THE California Republican Associa
tion, the newly organized political
society, held last night an Important
session at which a constitution was
adopted, the Republican County Commit
tee was denounced and a plan by which
supervision of political affairs in every
Assembly district may be accomplished
was formulated. George D. Squires, the
president of the association, presided at
the session, which was executive.
The resolution which repudiates the dis
trict club organization of the Republican
Cotfnty Committee is as follows:
ARTICLE I.
Resolved, That this association views with
alarm the action of the Republican County
Committee In proposing to organize the As
sembly districts of this city for the coming
Presidential campaign on the old basis of one
man dictation.
Resolved, That in our opinion a system
whereby the clubs of the districts' are made
the vassals of the County' Committee is wrong
in principle and will result In party confusion
and disaster. It being our opinion that it is the
duty of the County Committee, as the alleged
representative of Republicanism In this city,
to call the Republicans together in the dis
tricts and authorize them to organize without
the interference of any boss or any set of
bosses.
Resolved, That it is our opinion that any
other course will bring disaster upon the party
and Jeopardize the success of the national
ticket In this city, where the Republican party
time and again has shown that it will not
submit to the dictation of bosses or the con
trol of their henchmen.
The constitution which will govern the
association was then adopted. The instru
ment provides for tho establishment of
an advisory council in every Assembly
district and is as follows:

gates from other sections of the State of
fer them* Delegates from Los Angeles,
San Diego and San Francisco programme
Press dispatches nnd private messages
5rom the Atlantic and Middle West States
indicate increasing sentiment among Re
publicans In favor of nominating Irving
M. Fcott cf California for Vice President
Â«-*f the United States. Leading politicians
hold that the ticket would be strengthened
by the nomination of a Pacific Coast man
for second place. Passing events in the
Orient and the signs of great commercial
development on the Pacific Coast of the
Vnitt-d States attrax-t the attention of the
world and suggest to leading Republicans
cf the Union the idea cf selecting a can
didate from this region.
Irving M. Scott is known throughout
the country as the builder of the battle-
Fhip Oregon and the cruiser Olympia â the
two ships that gave the American navy
â¢worldwide renown In engagements with
thf- Spanish fleet.
The name of Irving M. Scott is therefore
Associated with these naval achievements,
leading men of the party who are cast
ing about for material to render the ticket
exceptionally popular with the masses
fancy that Scott's name would add ele
raonts of great popularity.
Irving M. Scott is recognized In Cali
fornia as a. representative man â a citizen
Â«<f character, energy and intellectual at
tainments. Yesterday many of the Re
publicans of San Francisco discussed the
]iropose<] nomination, and the hope was
expressed that the California delegation
to the National Convention would unfurl
the banner of Scott and actively demand
his nomination. It happens, however,
that the Third Congressional District con
vention has Indorsed Secretary Long for
Vice President. State Senator JLuchsin
irer, who looks out of one eye for
xhe navy-yard at Mare Island and out of
Ihe ether eye for his own fences, managed
xo commit the delegates of his district to
Ihe Secretary of the Navy. M. A. Gunst
Â«jf the Fourth District and Harold Power
of the Second have no hesitation In de
claring that the California delegation
should support a Callfornian if the name
of a candidate from this State is presented
lo the convention.
Irving M- Scott is not excited or agi
tated over his boom for the Vice Presi
Â«3ency. He has received many letters and
Â«lispa.tches assuring him of support. He
says the Imom was started in the East
i.::il is moving West. Many newspaper.*
containing flattering notice of his candi
dacy come to him and several of the
Journals display his name at the head of
ihe first column of the lirst page.
At the clubs, hotols and other places
Trticre politicians meet to exchange views
on the state of the country and the pros
pects of the convention season the can-
Ididacy of Irving M. Scort is a topic of
ipeneral comment. Delegates to the na
tional convention fancy that no positive
auction will be taken on their part until
the delegation reaches Philadelphia.

By command of the Supervisors the people of the
city are to be saved from the affrighting influences of
street fences and high signs. While the board was
engaged in the work of reform it might have turned
its attention to the nerve-racking and eye-disturbing
advertisements in the street cars. \
Recent events. in Democratic politics indicate very
clearly that Mayor Phelan's notion of the scope of
j civil service reform is to teach your political oppo
| uents good manners and the virtues of patience by
forcing them to watch the enjoyment with which their
enemies hold public office.
! San Francisco has in its financial budget for the
! next fiscal year many new items for which provision,
must be made, but the one that will strike the people
of the city with deepest and most serious meaning, is
i that which provides for the burial of soldiers of the
I United States.
The Austrian Reichsrath is up todate if not a little
beyond. At a recent session of that distinguished
legislative body some of the members came armed for
argument with hammers. They must have been
studying one of the cherished American customs.
National naval authorities have come to the con
clusion that San Francisco harbor is an ideal' place for
the operation of submarine boats. This may mean
that Washington thinks we are better qualified to
work things out of sight than on the surface.
The Omaha. man who had his head smashed in a
collision and heard his wife remark that it was not an
accident but God's will probably thinks that the* busi
ness of relying implicitly in the divine will is going a
little too far. â¢ '^ â¢
The architect and newspaper man .who are going to
fight a duel over the architectural merits of the United
States building at the Paris Exposition really ought
to change their minds and carve one another for
something serious. From what we have heard the
structure is hardly worth quarreling about.
The prospect for the gold hunters who are speed
ing onward toward Cape Nome is certainly not one
of encouragement. They cannot now break the ice
barrier between them and their goal, and when they
do they will find all locations pre-empted. The search
for the golden fleece is not as romantic as it is repre
sented to be. Â»
Commissioner Wilson, Under Certain
Conditions, Will Refund All
Sums Paid in Excess.
Persons, who have paid money on the
Inheritance tax will be Interested in the
subject matter of a letter received yester
day by Internal Revenue Collector John
C. Lynch from Internal Revenue Commis
sioner Wilson. â¢
The letter states that the office at
"Washington, D. C, is ready to consider
claims for the refunding of taxes erron
eously paid on legacies or paid in excess
of the amount due. Under the act of June
13. 1MÂ»S, as construed by the recent decision
of the. United States Supreme Court,
claims of this character should be made
on form 4G and by the executors or ad
ministrator? who paid the tax. Each
claim should be- further supported by a
copy of the will of the testator unless a
copj' has been previously filed' In the of
fice of the Commissioner, and, a copy of
the return on which the tax was assesse'd.
and the amended return should be made
out in accordance with the law as con-'
ptrued by the United States Supreme
Court.
LEGACY-TAX PAYERS
TO GET A DRAWBACK
Editor The Call: There appeared an
editorial in The Call of May 27 under the
above caption, which to my mind was the
strongest article as touching our nation's
destiny that ever appeared in a San Fran
cisco paper, and If, as we are told by po
litical orators since the roar of our artil
lery at Manila Bay and Santiago harbor,
the United States has leaped to the front
in the march of nations, then these facts
to which The Call so earnestly Invites at
tention pertain not alone to San Francisco
or California or even our nation but to the
very future of human liberties, since ig
norance means superstition, darkness and
danger.
The facts given in .The Call's editorial
above referred to must be startling to one
who has not studied the subject. The pic
ture therein shown is dark indeed, and yet
the writer thereof might have made It of
Stygian blackness witnout perverting the
facts. Your article proves that about one
third of the children on the school census
do not become enrolled upon the school
registers at all. Let us add to that the
truth that many of those who have their
names enrolled upon the school registers
attend school but a few weeks dui*ing the
terra, anil the further fact that the figure*
presented do not go above the age of 17
or under the age of 5, when all must be
appalled.
And yet. Mr. Editor, if there be any con
solation to the freezing man to seo his
neighbor both cold and hungry, California
may congratulate herself, for there is
hardly a State in the Union where theso
deplorable conditions are not even wurso
than here.
Looking at the national conditions wo
find there are about thirty-six million
minors. Admitting there are nine millions
of these under five years ot age.- it leaves
twenty-seven millions of children of
school age. Of these about fourteen.mil
lions are enrolled some time during the
yenr on school registers. Less than nine
millions is the average attendance, while
eiKhty-seven Is the average number of
days of school according to enrollment.
- These figures so startled me when I
first began to study them that for the past
five years I have studied the educational
question more from the standpoint of the
children out of the schoolroom than from
that of the children in the schoolroom.
Pedagogical questions are of great Im
portance, but how to get all the children
in the schoolroom Is more so. I would
like permission to discuss this question at
some length In The Call. Respectfully,
JOHN F. MURRAY.

Pitcher Fond Made a Record as Sur
geon in the Manila
Hospitals.
Dr. A. Pond, more familiarly known tA
the baseball world as "Doc" Pond, re
turned home on the transport Grant after
a year in the hospitals at Manila, whera
he held the rank of acting assistant sur
geon. He made a record for himself as a
doctor in the Philippines, and It Is more
than likely that he will be promoted for
his gallant services. During his stay at
Manila he was located most oj the time
at tne First Reserve Hospital, -where ha
found plenty to do. His comrades speak
of him in the highest terms.
"Doc" Pond first came to the coast as a
member of the AU-Amertcan baseball
team, made up cf the stars of the Na
tional League. He was a famous pitcher
and all around man. and at one time drew
a fat salary as a ball player. Later he
played in the- Pacino Coust Leasuo and
was a general favorite. After the out
break of the war he received a commis
sion as actins a*sUtant sureeon and in
due time was trunsferrvd to Manila. Prior
to becoming a professional baseball player
he was grnJuatea a^ a physician, and his
record in the Philippines shows that his
training had been thorough.

Plans Formed at the Meeting Yes
terday to Secure More .
Money.
The Indian famine fund of San Fran
cisco has now reached the thousand dol
lar mark. I. J. Truman, treasurer of tha
fund, has forwarded already $000 to India
to aid the work of mercy. The money has
all been collected since the 24th ult. and
the amount indicates the extent of inter
est taken in this urgent cause.
.A meeting of the famine fund committee
was held yesterday in the lecture room at
the Y. M. C. A. building. Those present
were: Richard II. Gray, chairman; Miss
Lydia Bell, secretary; Mr. Juhl. Mrs. C.
T. Wilmot, Miss Bertha Hill and Miss
Blanche Partington.
A plan cf further work was agreed upon
which includes the placing of collection
boxes in prominent places, the sending of
explanatory t-irculars to various commer
cial associations and business houses and
an organized endeavor to interest these
churches and Sunday-schools which have
not already contributed to the fund. A
vote of thanks was tendered Mayor Phe
lan for his generous gift of the use of
Native Sons' Hall for the recent mass
meeting. It was also decided to accept
the offer of M. Israel Pryce, member of
the London Psychical Research Society,
to give half the proceeds of n lecture to
be delivered by him at the Metropolitan
Temple on the 2Sth inst. Mr. Pryce's sub
ject will be "The Immortality of the
Soul," and the committee will interest
themselves to make the affair a success.

THE SALOON IN POLITICS.
Of PON the shoulders of the reputable, responsible
citizens of San Francisco there rests a duty
which cannot be evaded by any excuse. Upon
the substantial men of this city there is an obligation
to take a personal, intimate and persistent part in
â¢ ... .... Â¦ - -
the poiitics ot their city, their State and their nation.
If reforms are to be Instituted, if evils are to be reme
died, if rascals, making of politics a profession of
disrepute, are to be shorn 01 power corruptly used,
the change must be brought about by men who have
honor in themselves and insist upon it in others.
Men of family and of affairs, men of decency and self
respect, men possessing substantial interest in' the fu
ture of the city, even if that interest be no more than
the possession of a modest home and the reward of
â¢ ... . * . .
their labor, are in duty bound to take into their own
hands and out of the soiled fingers of blacklegs and
saloon loafers the government of San Francisco.
Politics should be a profession, but it should be the
profession of every honorable citizen. The very
crown of citizenship is participation in political affairs,
and never in the history cf this city was the time more
propitious or the need more pressing than now for
men who value any interest they may possess to seek
to preserve it. We have learned the stern lesson jf
a bubonic Board of Health. We have seen the evil
wrought by political physicians to trade and indus
try. We have seen the name of the city heralded
as a sound of reproach. We have suffered the shame
of scandal in our Police Department, and only by
stubborn resistance and agitation have escaped from
the domination of blackmailing scoundrels raised to
a bsd eminence by scheming, criminal politicians.
We see the polluting influence of saloon politicians
in our schools, where favorites reign, where merit is
unrecognized, where extravagance runs riot and
where the drunken proprietors of drunkards' resorts
make and unmake the laws. We know the distress
and danger which have followed in the wake of squan
dered public funds. We have upon us yet the dark
ness of unlightcd streets and the menace of midnight
thieves. We see the discrimination of police admin
istration of saloons closed and dives wide open, with
out license, in the very heart of the city and upon its
leading thoroughfare.
We kr.ow all this nr.d know it to be the reign of
the professional politician. And we know also the
remedy which reputable citizens of San Francisco
must use or confess themselves criminally responsi
ble for a condition of affairs against which they pro
test. They must perform their duties as citizens.
They rmist take part in the political government of
their city or submit themselves and their interests to
the corrupt domination of men who choose conven
tion delegates, select nominees, control municipal of
ficers and govern the city from the back rooms of
The time was when reputable citizens dare not take
part in the primary politics of the city. Thugs,
thieves, roustabouts and rounders ruled the primaries
a:id nominated the governing officers of the city. But
that time has pissed. Every citizen has the power to
exercise his franchise and make his influence felt He
has the influence of numbers. He can with his vote
repudiate the professional politician, cut away the un
healthy parasites of politics and give to San Fran
cisco an administration of honesty and efficiency.
The time for reputable citizens to act is now, the
method is personal participation in the politics of their
The mr.rtial spirit of our- local police has asserted
itself. Thirteen of the finest at a fight and one at a
fire where the lives of 500 children were in jeopardy
is an admirable illustration of how flexible is the dis
cipline of the department. The officers were probably
afraid that the fighters would assault the crowd. '

THE CHINESE CRISIS.
yy ERLIN dispatches of yesterday announce that
KA the Kaiser's instructions to his representatives
in the Orient are that while Germany will in no
way put herself unduly forward and is willing to loy
ally co-operate with other powers, she will under no
circumstances tolerate a continuance of existing con
ditions in China, and the Cologne Gazette, which ia
reputed to be "inspired," is quoted as saying: "No
one cares whether the Chinese Government falls or
not, whether the Conservative or the Reform party
in that country triumphs, the one essential thing is the
establishment of order."
. Salisbury is reported to be sanguine that the con
cert of Europe will bring about a peaceful solution of
the difficulties of the situation and to have declared
Great Britain will not take action without co-opera
tion of the powers, unless Russian aggression be
comes more apparent than it is now. That means,
of course, Great Britain is not eager for a single
handed fight against Russia and that her statesmen
would prefer to have some other power take the
Thus it appears Russia is the only power that
knows what she wishes and has the courage to act
upon that knowledge. Her officials in China have
gone about their business without waiting for the aid
or consent of any other nation. How far the Czar
is assured of the co-operation or the neutrality of
France and Austria in any movement his armies may
make upon China is a secret which will not be re
vealed unless war break out. He seems,. however, to
be sanguine that he will be left to do very much as he
pleases and possibly he may even have an agreement
with the Kaiser concerning the re-establishment of
that good order which it has been announced is the
sole desire of Germany.
The chief element of danger in the situation is
Japan. It requires no great foresight to peFceive
that if the Japanese are ever to make an effort to pre
vent Russia from obtaining domination over Korea
and Northern China the sooner they get at it the
better. Their opportunity is now. Great Britain has
virtually finished the war in South Africa. An army
of 100,000 men will be ample for all purposes there.
She can therefore assure Japan against any interfer
ence from France or any other power to assist Rus
sia. So the circumstances of the time, as well as the
situation itself, tend to incline the Japanese to strike
at once. It is therefore fairly sure that unless the
powers can in some way compel Russia to hold her
hand we may have war before the summer is over and
the- memory of the Peace Conference at The Hague
will be mocked even by the Czar who summoned it.
ALL the patrol sergeants, their cap
tains and lieutenants were sum
moned to meet Chief Sullivan in
the Police Commissioners' room
yesterday morning. The meeting lasted
for nearly an hour, and after its adjourn
ment those present went away whistling |
"A policeman's lot is not a happy one." j
The Chief told the assembled officers ]
that he had been surprised by the lack of
discipline shown by a large proportion of
the force, and he pointed out the causes
for. complaint. He had taken special no- j
tice of the manner in which the officers I
on the quarantine cordon in Chinatown
walked their boats. Some walked as if
they -had a heavy burden on their shoul
ders and life was not. worth living. When
a superior officer approached them, in
stead of coming to "attentiosi" and salut-
Ing properly they lifted the right hand
about a foot or so, swinging it around
as If it was great trouble to do even that
much. All officers must, when a superior
officer approaches, stand at attention and
give the proper salute, and remain at at
tention till the superior Ieave3 them, the
Chief ordered. '
Another thing that the Chief objected to
was the habit of policemen on their beats
talking politics and prizefights at street
corners. That had to be stopped, and an
officer must not talk to any citizen unles3
to answer a question put to him. the Chief
said. He must in the daytime walk on the
outside curb of the sidewalk, so that he
can see what is going on and be seen, and
at night he must walk in the shadow of
the buildings. He must parade his beat
from end to end and keep his eyes and
ears open.
"I read to the sergeants," said the
Chief, after the meeting, "the rules which
were recently adopted and are now In
print The sergeants are la closer touch
with the men than any one else, and I
look to them to see that proper disciplina
is enforced. I am determined to stop all
this easy-going sort of business, and if
the present sergeants cannot do so I will
pet others who will. There are several
things that require changing, and It
must be done. I have seen police
men durinjr a windstorm seek the shelter
of a doorway or something: else conveni
ent. That must be stopped. They must
parade their beats no matter what tha
weather may be. I want to make the de
partment one of the best on the conti
nent."
The men are wondering what will strike
them next. They had to set white stripes
on their trousers and white service stripes
on their coat sleeves and their coats
shortened. Now all of the old-time privi
leges are to be taken from them, and no
wonder they sing "A policeman's lot 13
not a happy one."

POLICEMEN'S LOT WILL SURELY
BE AN UNHAPPY ONE NOW
e PACIFIC COAST CANDIDATE.
THE announcement that Irving M. Scott is a
candidate ; for the Republican nomination for
Vice President will be received with gratifica
tion , throughout the Pacific Coast. It is time
the claims of this section of the Union should be rec
ognized in the politics of the country. The prece
dents of the past have established it as an unwritten
law that the President and the Vice President should
not be citizens of the same section of the Union.
Very rarely has the tule been violated. , Before the
war when the candidate for one of these offices was
chosen from the North the other was selected from
the South. Since the war the custom has been to
choose one from the East and the other from the
West. Up to this time the people on the Atlantic
seaboard have regarded the Mississippi Valley as the
West, but now the Pacific Coast has attained so much
of wealth and population that' the title "The Greater
West" is hers, and accordingly candidates who'.are
to represent Western progress and prestige most be
chosen from this side the continent.
When first the question of the selection of a can
didate for the Vice Presidency on the Republican
ticket came up for discussion The Call advocated the
nomination of a man from the Pacific Coast. At that
time The Call had no particular candidate to advance
and presented the claims of the Greater West solely
on the ground that it is entitled to recognition. It
i? gratifying to note that the claim has been recog
nized in the East, to the extent at least of giving con
sideration to the candidacy of a Californian. It now
remains for the people of the Greater -West to 'do
what they can to make that candidacy, successful.
Irving M. Scott is one of the foremost business
men of the time. His name and his work are known
in every commercial and industrial center; of. the
world. The warships built in his yards are the most
famous that no\v uphold our flag upon the ocean, nor
is there any other battleship of any nation whatever
now aflont upon the seas so renowned as the Oregon. .
Great as have been his successes in business Mr.
Scott has not devoted his energies solely to industry
and commerce. He has been active in the performance
of all the duties of citizenship and has taken a keen
interest in public affairs. He is 'well known in the
politics of California and has been'one of the stanch
est supporters of the Republican party and its poli
cies. As a campaign worker, writer and orator he
ranks among the foremost on the Pacific Coast, and
the value of his service has been widely recognized
not only here but in the East.
The nomination of Mr. Scott would strengthen the '
Republican party throughout the West. He has high
qualifications for the office to which he aspires. The
Senate would find in him a presiding officer of firm
ness, impartiality and energy. His candidacy is there
fore'one which the whole of the West can well afford
to indorse and work for. Let us have a Californian
Vice President to start the century. "J
destruction by the Anglo-Saxon
IN some American papers it is treated as extraor
j â¢ 1 . dinary that signs are abroad of the existence of
j * great cordiality between Spain and the Central and
I South American republics which were once her
colonies. v
The thirteenth birthday of the boy King of Spain
was recently celebrated in Paris by an elaborate func
tion at the residence of the Spanish Minister. The
representative of Spain was assisted at this function
by the Ministers at Paris of Mexico, Chile, Nica
ragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica. Paraguay and the
Argentine Republic, in fact every former colony of
Spain in this hemisphere that maintains a legation at
the French capital was represented. The anniversary
was one incident to the last spark of hope of rejuve
nation of the Spanish monarchy. The future of
Spain as a monarchy depends upon the physical and
mental quality of this half Austrian lad. No courtesy
can more impress Spain than that offered by the dip
lomatic representatives of her former colonies on
such an occasion.
But this matter is not as extraordinary as some
American papers have made it appear.. Those coun
tries revolted from Spain, but since their independ
ence she has in no way sought their injury. She did
not insist in 18J4 upon claiming their people as sub
jects and. impressing them on the high seas as Eng
land claimed Americans in 1812. The base of the blood
of all the races from the Rio Grande to the Straits
of Magellan is Iberian and they have the same right
to boast of their Latin blood that we have to get high
and mighty over our Anglo-Saxon strain.
Even if- we treat this demonstration at Paris as an
expression of unfriendliness to the United States and
as cutting the slight bond of Pan-Americanism, there
is no need of surprise at that aspect of it. There is
no doubt that after the Venezuelan affair the United
States was in' high favor throughout South and Cen
tral America. The sixty millions of people who make
up the populations of the states on the isthmus and
continent south of us seemed to immediately develop
a hemispherical patriotism. They considered their
destiny and future as independent factors in the pub
lic and national family of the new world. Inspired
by the example of the United States they forgot Eu
rope as related to their career and the common bond
of civil institutions seemed stronger than the ties of
race and blood.
This was the'situation when the Spanish war broke
out. Unfortunately that brief and hardly glorious
struggle was accompanied by an American attack on
the Spanish race and character. Speeches made in
our Congress without qualification or exception
escribed the most monstrous qualities to all Span
iards. We did not pause for facts. The American
heart must be fired for war and to do so the Spanish
race was represented as a race of assassins, thieves,
perjurers, cowards and dastards. Some of the
speeches on that subject delivered in our Congress are
models of invective and, we must confess, of vitupera
tion.
This denunciation had its effect upon the Spanish
races in Central and South America. If they, ad
mitted the truth of the awful indictment they would be
admitting the taint of their own blood and the moral
inferiority of their race. But they did not admit, they
denied, and before a shot had been fired in the war
we had alienated every nation south of the Rio
What followed was not calculated to restore our
lost popularity in that region. We have appeared to
those people as avid of territory, with a new appetite
for conquest and all of the slowly 'allayed apprehen
sions excited by the Ostend manifesto have been re
newed. To them we stand as the world's leading pro
ponent of the doctrine that might makes right and
this effect has been to dull the asperities that were
between themselves, induce a closer union of inter
ests and a fonder feeling for their mother land. This
is all in the expectation that the time may come when
they must appeal to the world against us. It is born
of the belief that the hundred and sixty millions of
people of the Latin race will have to stand together
in some form of alliance to protect their states from
The memory of Bolivar and Sucre is no less cher
ished than formerly and the Latin-Americans are no
doubt devoted to popular institutions as they have
them, but this very devotion leads them to profound
ly distrust our intentions. The recent declaration of
a Methodist bishop that the world would soon come
to be all governed by a committee of four, consisting
of Great Britain, the United States, Germany and
Russia, is a bumptious expression of a virulent species
of international and flamboyant jingoism, but it is ac
cepted with sober literalness by our southern neigh
bors.
The evidence of the unfriendly situation is not con
fined to the ceremonial exhibit at Paris. Ever since
we entered upon the courses which led us through
the Spanish war our Central and South American
trade Has declined.* Those people have turned to
Europe and have averted their faces and diverted
their trade from us. This is a fact that we do not
announce with a bugle. Our trade statistics as far as
possible suppress it and strive to make it inconspicu
ous in the swell of our exchanges with Europe.
But while we do not at present feel the loss, it is a
symptom that is startling. Trade rarely follows senti
ment. It travels on the lines of fitness and cheap
ness. When it abandons these and follows sentiment
that sentiment must be very strong.
That this has occurred in Central and South Amer
ica is proof that the United States is as much isolated
: n the New World as Great Britain is in the old.
Fear and not friendship is the sentiment we inspire
now. We have gone backward to the. basis and the
feeling of the Ostend manifesto. We stand again for
the righteousness of might and we must face the con
So the Pan-American dream of Monroe and Blaine
djssolves and passes away. Between us and our
Latin- American neighbors is built a barrier of sus
picion that a century to come will not see removed
unless by some conspicuous and unselfish action on
our part equally as great as our defense of Venezuela.

Auditor Wells has served formal notice
upon Sullivan & Sullivan, attorneys for
Bateman Bros., builders of the Hall -of
Justice. Informing them that unless ac
tion Is commenced in the courts against
the city to settle their claims within five
days he will disregard their notice to
withhold the balance of $S7,S57 now in the
fund set aside for the building of the
hall. This action is calculated to bring
matters to a head and force the settle
ment of the claim's against the city aris
ing from the construction of the hall.
The Auditor stated yesterday that the
demand for money to pay the city's ob
ligations Is so great and the cash account
so short that he did not feel like longer
assuming the responsibility of withhold
ing on a mere notice moneys justly due
worklngmen. The original fund amount
ed to $203,950. On this demands have been
audited amounting to $216,857. leaving a
balance of about $S7,S57 on hand. The
first contract price of the hall was $216.
857, but Bateman Bros, have in addition
a large bill for "extras" and. besides
these, other contracts for additions and
changes in the building amount to a con
siderable figure.
Hateman Bros, have the first chance at
the fund. Against them $30,000 worth of
liens have been filed with the Auditor.
The other contractors are now clamoring
for money t ami the Auditor proposes to
honor their claims at once, regardless of
those of the original contractors, unless
Bateman Bros, take legal steps to prevent
him so doing.

J. R. Hay, alias Hayes, was arrested
early yesterday morning on Kcarny street
by Captain Jules J. Callundan and Patrol
man J. R. Cleary of the Morse Detective
Agency and charged at the California
street police station with obtaining money
under false pretenses. The arrest was
made on a warrant sworn to by Walter A.
Gompertz, cashier for R. Dunsmuir's
Sons Company, which firm Is a victim to
the extent of $140 of the novel scheme
worked by the accused.
According to the complaint on file Hay
represented himself as a solicitor for the
Mercantile Gazette Publishing Company
of Denver, Chicago, Seattle and San Fran
cisco and as such secured the signature
of the firm to a contract for a small sum
for an advertisement..
Hay's description of the vast circulation
of his publication and its worth as an
advertising medium, together with the
cheap rate asked, caused the firm to be
lleve the Investment a good one and the
contract was signed on first presentation
and the money was paid to Hay at the
same time. In the left hand upper cor
ner of the printed form were the words
"Contract No. â ," above which, on re
ceipt of the coin, Hay wrote the words,
"TheÂ« undersigned firm has paid in full
all demands or.." and then signed his
name In the presence of the advertiser.
A few days after this transaction Hay
presented a bill for a large amount to the
cashier of the firm. Pinned to the bill was
the contract described with the blank
spaces filled In to correspond with the
amount demanded. The words written
by Hay at the time of securing the con
tract were not in evidence, having been
carefully out from the body of the docu
ment by the scheming operator. "
The cashier was not aware of the orig
inal transaction, but was satisfied with
the firm's signature and handed over the
amount to Hay. without comment. In due
course of time the fraud was discovered
Â«nd steps were Immediately taken to
round up the wily solicitor.
In Investigating. the man's record It was
found that the Dunsmuir's Sons Company
was not the only victim of Hay's clever
"graft" and further that the concern-rep
resented by him never, did exist except in
the smooth trickster's fertile Imagina
tion. ;,
The case agalnst'Hay was assigned. to
Judge Cabaniss yesterday, but was heard
by Judge Mogan. The prisoner was rep
resented by Attorney Curtis, who asked
that the case be dismissed, as there was
then no complaint on file, but the request
was â¢ denied - by Judge Mogan. ; who In
formed the attorney that he would listen
to a motion to dismiss this morning. At
torney Curtis declared that he would sue
out a writ of habeas corpus for the re
lease of his client. .Â¦

saying on the first subject. Emil collect-

could not say whether they aggregated
$3000 a month or not.
THE Inquest into the cause of death
of Emil Rosenbaum was concluded
yesterday afternoon and the jury
returned a verdict of suicide. The
first witness was Mrs. Terese Parks of
1530 Fulton street. She is a sister of Mrs.
Rosenbaum and her beauty made a visible
impression upon the Coroner and the jury.
Her testimony was to the e # ffect that Mr.
and Mrs. Rosenbaum were* the happiest
married couple she ever knew, and that
having lived in the same house with them
for some time she had ample opportunity
of learning how they got along together.
Louis Cook, professional watcher of the
dead, told the jury that he was called in
to sit up with the body at 8 o'clock laÂ§t
Monday evening. The body had been un
dressed and laid out before he arrived.
He saw two tumblers on the music stand
near the piano which he was informed had
contained the poison.
Isaac S. Rosenbaum, uncle of the dead
man, was the next and last witness, and
In reply to questions as to the relations
between Emil and his brother Albert, said
that he did not know of any cause that
might have led up to Emll's death. He
had heard Albert on several occasions
begging Emil not to go to the races and
squander his money. The witness never
heard that Mrs. Sadie Rosenbaum had.ac
companied her husband to the office to
save him from attacks of Albert. Albert
and Emil seemed to be the best of friends.
He had never heard Emil speak of com
mitting suicide. With reference to the
sanity of the dead man the witness al
ways considered him rational and capable
of doing business, but at times his con
versation was light. On such occasions

Secretary of the American Box Fac
tory Charged With Conspiracy
to Defraud.
J. W. Bartholemew was arrested last
evening in Lane's Hospital by United
States Marshal Shine on complaint of R.
P. Merillon, president of the American
box factory, charging Bartholemew with
unlawful conspiracy to defraud the United
States out of large sums of monev in vio
lation of section 6440. Revised Statutes.
The complaint was sworn to at 5 o'cloclc

Court Commissioner Manley in the ab
sence of Commissioner Heacock.
Bartholemew was sick at the hospital,
and United States Commissioner GeorgÂ«
E. Morse proceeded to the hospital and

The Board of Education in committee
yesterday overhauled the rules governing
the department and_made some important
changes. Hereafter teachers who are ab
sent for more than two months, except
in case of serious illness, will be placed
on the substitute list and their places
filled by the election of teachers on that
list. Teachers suffering from tuberculo
sis or offensive catarrh, upon proper ex
amination are subject to suspension or
dismissal, and the samo fate will befall
all employes of the department who fail
to pay their debts.
The expected did not happen in regard
to the apportionment of pupils in classes.
The rule remains practically as before â
the maximum of enrolled pupils in first
grade classes will be 50. on an average at
tendance of* 43. and in all other grades
55 on an average attendance of 45. The
home study hours were reduced, however,
the rule now being th*it pupils of the
fifth, sixth and seventh-grades are to be
given not more than one hour of home
study; pupils of the eighth grade not
more than one and a half hours, and
high school grades not more than two
hours.
An important change was the reduction
of the time for holding: examinations for
promotion from one year to six months,
giving pupils who are behind a chance to
catch up more readily. The present rule
relieving principals who have eight
classes or more under their care from
teaching was amended, a provision being
madothat in the absence of c teacher
for not more than five day:* the principal
shall conduct the classes of the absentee,
provided that in the absence of two teach
ers from the same school at one time the
principal may have assistance.
The new rule governing the absence of
teachers reads as follows:
"Leave of absence granted to any teach
er for a period of more than two months,
unless In casev oL serious illness, shall
necessitate the placing of such teacher
upon the substitute list, and another
teacher shall be psrmanently assigned to
the position thus vacated, provided that
teachers who *fcaTÂ»? served continuously
in the department for ten years may be
granted leave of absence, without pay, for
/not more than one year, and the positions
of such teachers, shall be kept open until
they return, provided that such leave of
absence when once granted cannot be ab
breviated, and provided further that three
and six months' leave of absence shall be
granted only from the beginning of the
term, except In cases of total disability."
Following are the new rules concerning
teachers who do not pay their debts and
those who have contracted contagious dis
ea "Any employe of this department who
willfully neglects to pay his or her Just
debts, having the aoillty to do so. shall be
subject to suspension or dismissal from
the department." - -
"Any teacher in this department who.
after proper examination by a physician
designated by the Board of Education,
shall be found to be suffering from tuber
culosis or offensive catarrh shall be liable
to dismissal." m .
Mrs Klncald was chairman or the com
mittee, but all of the members of the
board took part In the discussion. Su
perintendent Webster was also Present.
All agreed to the changes. The board will
meet in regular session to-day to formally
adopt the rules.

TVHEATâ The foreign markets were quieter,
but Chicago reported renewed excitement owing
to Insufficient rains in the Northwest, where
there were only light and scattered ehowers.
The demand was general and the tone strong.
Corn was easy and neglected. Later on the
market became .quieter with some realizing
and there was a disposition to hold oft for the
Government report. The American visible sup
ply decreased slightly. Advices from the North
west were tho won't yet received, and the con
sensus of the best opinion is that half a crop is
all that is possible under any conditions.
London reported very beneficial rains and fa
vorable crop prospects in the Danubian prov
inces: also heavy rains in Southern Rus
sia, with crop iprospects all that could be de
sired. .

CHICAGO. June 11.â "Wheat was excited
and buoyant to-day and the pit a very busy
place. A huge amount of trade was transacted.
All the ccmmi?Eion houses had an extra num
ber of brokers in the pit â "jammed In, crammed
In, any v.-ay to get in," as one of them put it.
Fluctuations were wide. Practically there was
but cne consideration, the situation of, the
sprinp crop in the Northwest. The frantic ad
vances, however, were tempered by large
profit-realizing: eales. Had it. not. been for these
sales the price might have advanced right on
through the roof. Despite the stuK put on the
market in this way most of the advance waÂ«
held. Prices depended upon the pressure of
buyers or fellers at the time. July opened at
72%fi7:^c and shot up to 73?4@73"f,c without a
brtak. "Realizing by longs forced it hack to
73Vic, but following the dip, the market ad
vanced aggressively to 74c, the highest price
since October, when the Boer was began. A de
cline from this price to 73Â»6Â«?78ttc was Jollowed
hy a recovery to 73vi<373"4c. On the heels of this
buljre July dropped to 73i,4c; then recovered
to 73^8&7o>ic and, to wind up, dropped to 73',ic.
at which the market closed at 2 1 / i(S2Vic over
Saturday. At the opening the fact that the
Northwest had received no rain over Saturday
was a piece of bull information staring trad
ers in the fice. Rain had fallen In moderate
showers around the drought stricken section,
but the Dakotas and Minnesota were still dry.
To-day's signal service prediction held forth no
hope of relief. During the day reports of
damages in .the Northwest flooded the com
mission houses. The burden of them was that
an optimistic view promised less than half a
crop; that a week more oÂ£ dry weather meant
the practical destruction ef the crop. With
Information of this sort clou at hand foreign
news was ijmored comnietely.
The corn market was quiet and although it
showed tone advance early under the influ
ence of the wheat etrensth, lost It later and
closed heavy. July closed *ic down at 38*4c.
Oat3 were fairly active. July closed un
chancrd at 22c.
Provisions were dull and featureless, clos
ing rather easy. The market phowed some
steadiness early. In sympathy with the wheat
strength, but lost it later. July pork closed un
changed. July lard 2 1 / %@5c lower and July ribs
a rhude down.
The leadins futures ranged as follows:

As navigators know It, the world \s
â¢ihrinklns- In tiu * unimportant matter of
miles it remains about what it has been,
but steam and railroads have caused it to
shrink until it Is or.ly about one-twenty
rirst as large as it was m the year 1300.
Drake and Cavendish, in 1j77 and LJS5
respectively, went round the world with
British sailors, the former In about Ma
gellan'a time, the latter in a trifle over
two years.
Â¦William Dampier, pirate, scientist,
author and nautical bully, took twelve*
years to sail about the world. He so
abused Alexander Selkirk that the latter
was fairly willing to be marooned on Ju.in
Fernandez Island, thus making ".Robin
son Cruaoe" possible.
By degrees it grew possible to go about
the world In sailing ships in 130
days, but steamers eliminating the ele
ment of luck, have now carried a man
around in lifty-two days. This is the rec
ord made in 1S01 by the Peninsular and
Oriental and Canadian Pacific steamers-

treatment will at once be made.
Very little Is known of him except that
he Is believed to have come from Ohio
recently, and an effort to ascertain his
name and that of his people, in order to
inform them as to hi3 condition, will also
be made. .

powers. It has seen him lower the colors
of George Green and Frank McConnel!

these lights they have seen Neill light

NtiH has apologies to offer. He claims
that he underrated his man;- that he was
not in the best of condition and lastly
that his arm failed him. He positively
claims that ho can defeat Moffatt and all
he wants is .'mother chance. If It Is
given him ho will fight as he has In past
iiattres and with a determination to win
back U:e laurels he worked so hard to
gain. In Uie minds of many patron3 of.
the game the local clubs would make a
hit If they could match tne men for an
other contest.
AL NEILL. the local middleweight
who was defeated by Jack Moffatt
of Chicago on Friday evening last,
craves an opportunity to retrieve
his lost laurels. He has seen Managers
Crowley and Gibbs of the Columbia and
National Athletic clubs and appealed to
both fight promoters to give him another
chance at h!s hard hitting rival. He also
called on Kam Pooler, manager of the
Eastern pugilist, and made all sorts of
honorable inducements for another en
gagement. That Neill ts In earnest in his
desire for another match Is evidenced by
the fact that he visited the office of The
Call yesterday and deposited a check for
$1000 with W. J. Martin, the business man
ager, as a side bet. He is confident that
he can defeat Moffatt and is willing to
wager that amount on his ability to do
so.
The local boxing clubs are debating the
advisability of matching the two men
again. The shreÂ« - d tignt promoters feel
certain that a return bout would draw a
crowded house and both clubs express a
willingness to give Nelll another chance.
Hut there is an obstacle In their path and
that Is Mr. Pooler of Chicago. He wants
easier game for his man. Having had the
satisfaction of taking Neill's forfeit
money and then defeating the Callfornian,
he now wants his bread-winner to tackle
men who are less famous and less scien
tific than Nelll; men who will be easy pick
ing for Moffatt. Jt is probable that "Tim"
Murphy, the Australian who was sent to
dreamland by Al's mighty right, will be
Moffatt's next antagonist. It is doubt
ful whether either club hankers after tho
match, but they must bow to the will of
Air. Pooler.

1118 Broadway, June 11.
The warehouses of George Althauser at
Alvarado. with 4000 bales of straw, besides
four Southern Pacitlc flatcars, were
burned on Saturday, causing a loss of
JIO.000. The fire threatened to destroy the
Grangers' Motel, a high wind blowing In
the direction of the building, and carrying
sparks and embers for a mile, over the
town. The most active work of a volun
teer fire brigade prevented the destruction
of much more property.
The fire started in a corner of the huge
warehouse and spread so quickly through
the plies of inflammable straw that there
was not time to attempt to save anything
from the structure. On the tracks at the
warehouse was a train of frelghtcars.
Some of these were hauled out of danger,
but the four which were burned could not
be moved. The townspeople organized a
bucket brigade and bent their efforts to
save the village. The Grangers" Hotel Is a
large frame structure directly opposite
the warehouse, and It was frequently in
dancer from the blazing cinders and the
flaming debris which were blown across
the railroad track. A fortunate shifting
of the wind aided the fire fighters In their
work. The fire cleaned out the warÂ»
hon=es and contents very speedily, but for
hours afterward the people, were com
pelled to watch for Incipient blazes
through the town.
The burned building was 200 feet lone
and was about half full of straw. The
contents belonged to Kd Salz of Decoto
Both warehouse and contents were tn-
Fured. The fire Is supposed to have been
caused by tramps.

The C!ty Attorney has filed an opinion
with the Foard of Supervisors in answer
to a. resolution respecting a proposed
plan of raising Immediate revenue by re
bating interest and penalties en delinquent
taxes. The attorney eayi in his opinion:
There 5r r.o statute or other provision of law
â¢whioh Â«n?oÂ«-er( the mur.lcliÂ»aiity to remit
tax*-!". Interest on same, or penalties, which are
legally due and payable, a valid tax must bÂ«
c.'.'.rr-'rd |a toto. An invalid tax 1Â« not to be.
treated ne a tax at ell, hence no penalties arise
thereunder. The nlan proponed is to rebaf;
penalties, etc.. upon valid assessments, which
is. in rr;y o^inli-n, beyond the power o* the
board.
The ordinance limiting the height of
fences for advertising purposes to ten feet
Â¦was amended by the Beard of Supervisors
yesterday so that it will go into effect on
July l, lSOl. instead of immediately, as
originally intended. The ordinance as
amended was finally passed by a unani
mous vote.
The amendment was proposed by Brand
onstein. who eald that in justice to the
blU posters who had large contracts ahead
ibe date for putting the measure in full
force and effect should be extended one
year. The amendment was seconded by
Connor. Heed stated that L. D. Owens,
representing the bill posting concerns, had
agreed to so arrange his business that all
contracts hereafter entered into would
terminate at the end of the year and no
hardship would result to the interested
parties.
Booth did not see why a particular date
Fhould be set for the ordinance to be ef
fective.
"The bill posters." said Booth, "might
fnter Into n<-w contracts at the end of the
year and then ask for another extension.
1 now desire to present an amendment
that so far as existing bona tide contracts
row held by the bill posters are concerned
they shall not be affected by the ordin
ance. 1 think this Is fair to both sides."
Booth's amendment, however, failed to
receive a second. Owens then announced
the intention of the bill posters to test the
ordinance in the courts in any event, and
tho measure finally passed, after the opin
ion of the City Attorney in regard to its
validity had been read.
A resolution was adopted providing for
the final acceptance of the Hall of Justice
an^l Morpue buiidinp. provided the con
tractors and their bondsmen furnish a re
lease < f all claims apainst the city prow
ing out of the erection of the building or
the carrying out of the contract of 1S97
or any Fubsecuent contract or modifica
tion thereof.
Comte offered an amendment providing
that if said releases are not executed
within three days then after legal notice
given* the city and county, through its
architects, proceed to finish the building
u per contract at the expense of the
mrety company.
Jm explanation Comte said that It is not
prudent to accept' the. building unless
Ii.Tteman Brothers, the original contract
or^. aroUld i-i^n a release and If it were
rot pi vi n the citv could proceed to finish
;:Â¦Â» building. If the amendment were
r.doptod it might lead to a compromise
and settlement of the question.
An <<ruiiiuv.cn was passed to print dlrect
h -' the Auditor to audit and the Treas
urer to pay out cf the sum of J1I.932 at
Â¦ â¢ -â¢ nt credited to the public building
fund ihe approved claims of the various
Â¦persons, firms and corporations that have
K en < ngaped in making alterations in the
HÂ«U of Justice and Morgue building.
McCarthy introduced a resolution which
Â¦Â»â¢:Â¦.* rr-ff-rred to the Street Committee
r::estloning the right of the Market Street
Railway Company to suspend trolley
wires over Bush street between Kearny
ur.d Fansome as fellows:
Whereas. The Market Street Railway Com
jar.y has suspended trolley wires over Bush
rtreet. between Kearny anJ Sar.=ome streets,
a:A
Whereas. Ther* 1* rrfat doobt of the. right

Â¦rlthout authority the Hoard of Public Works
fhall r"i>ort the f-arae forthwith to the board.
McCarthy eaid that the company evi
dectiy had no authority to operate trolley
crlrea on the street as it had done the
w>rk during the night. The Mayor
thoujrht that the board should grant the
privilege on the petition of the company

THOMAS PRINGLE IS
ASPHYXIATED IN BED
Thomas Pringle, proprietor of a saloon
at 901 Larkln street, was found dead yes
terday morning on a lounge in a room
back of his saloon. The gas was turned
on but unlighted and the barroom was
filled with the suffocating fumes.
. Deputy Coroner Meehan found that the
key of the gas fixture was so loose that
even when It was turned off he could light
the gas that escaped from the connection
atthe thumbplebe. A note was found ad
dressed to his .barkeeper and brother-in
law. Alfred Barr>N requesting him to put
on "some water in the' morning for the
lager. --Â¦.â¢-"- Â¦ -
Pringle was a ; married . man, 47 years
old. and a native of Scotland. There Is
little doubt that the death was acci
dental. The deceased lived with his wife
at 1020 Sutter street, but it-was his habit
to sleep In the room back of the saloon
whenever his business kept him up late.

let "Fifty Years Ago" that she is doing
at the Orpheum this week.
"Fifty Years Ag-o" is from the pen of
Hubert Henry Davies and is one of those
efforts that makes a place eager to claim
the man who wrote it. It is clever and
has Jus=t the requisite blending of pathos
and humor. It Is put in that picturesque
setting that carries one back to the days
of the stately minuet, and affords the
actress scope for her exquisite talent.
In contrast to the picture plavlet is the

After one has seen Keilar perform his
miracles the feats of the high class In
dian fakers appear . easy and common

itual mediums are but cheap and trans
parent devices when placed alongside
tho?e of this wonderful magician. The
question is not what he can do but what
he cannot do. He causes an orange tree
to sprout from {he seed and to bear fruit,
which he picks off and distributes among
the audience, and at his bidding the most
beautiful roses bud and blccm. The levi

The body ofÂ«his comely assistant floats in

disappearing woman in the cage is one of
the most surprising illusions that have
ever been placed before the public. A
cage empty is hoisted half way between
the footlights and the proscenium, the
curtains being drawn. Another cage is
placed at the back of the stage and into
this is placed the Princess. The curtains
are lowered, shutting her from view, then
are thrown open again and the Princess
has disappeared. At the same moment
the curtains inside the suspended cage
fly up and show her inside it.
A cabinet is put together on the stage,
and sb soon as it is erected hands appear
playing tamborlnes and faces show them
pclves in the apertures. Then the struc
ture is taken down piecemeal, showing no
possible hiding place. The performance
is one of the best in its line that has ever
been given on the stage, and the audience
went away delighted, mystified, and with
a craving for more.
Fischer's Concert House.
Fischer's presents this week the usual
fu!l bill. Thc-so are the last few weeks of
the Lambardl opera quartet, and music
lovers will doubtless not neglect their op
portunity. A large audience last night
listened to the new programme, which in
cludes the fourth act from "Ernani." Miss
Isabella Underwood sang well her two
sonps, and the flute and clarionet solos of
C Holmfctead and C. Caeparl gave much
pleasure. Slgnor Abramotf sang the
"Palms." and did not quite hit it olf with
the orchestra, which apparently consid
ered itself leader In the adventure. There
was more than enough orchestra occa
sionally in the other vocal solos, too,
which should not be among such clever
players. The orchestral numbers were
greatly enjoyed.
Alcazar.
"Sapho" commenced its second week at
the Alcazar Theater last night and the
house was packed to the doors. Miss Flor
ence Roberts has made a decided hit In
the title role, and last night she and
Ernest Hastings received several curtain
calls. The play runs smoothly and will
without doubt nave crowded houses dur
ing the remainder of the week. To-mor
row night White Whittlesey will make his
appearance as leading man, Ernest Hast
ings' engagement concluding to-night.
Whittlesey made a most favorable impres
sion during his engagement last summer.
California,
There was a fair-sized audience to greet
Hoyt's "A Tin Soldier" at the California
Theater last evening. Dunne & 'Ryley's
company made every effort to please and
the applause given to a number of the
performers showed that the audience was
responsive. Amonc those recalled was
Miss Bessie TannehiU, whose vocal ability
was much appreciated. The Wiseman
Quartet was also well received. A num
ber of the selections provoked laughter.
Hoyt's "A Milk White Flag" will be pro

Harbor Hospital Kept Busy.
A son of A. PaladinI, the llsh man, and
nephew of Joe Barbadoes, Crlmmlns'
County Committoeman. kept the Harbor
ambulance on the move yesterday. The
youngster wus knocked down by a heavy
freight wagon on Washington street, near
Sansome. and two of his ribs were broken.
A call was sent to the Harbor Hospital
and the ambulance responded. In the
meantime the lad had been carried into a
drugstore and a doctor was in attendance.
He Jixed the child up. but when Barbadoes
appeared on the scene he insisted that tho
city and county would attend to the case
and that the doctor waa not necessary.
Paladini insisted upon his son being sent
home, however, and the ambulance was
sent back to the hospital. The horses were
hardly put away before a call came for it
to hurry back to Sansome and Washing
ton streets, as the relatives had decided
finally to send the child to the emergency
hospital. While the ambulance was on its
way back to the drugstore Paladini
changed his mind again and the boy was
sent home. A second time the ambulance
went back to tbe hospital empty, much to
the. disgust of the driver.

The Widow Says Her Husband Had
Threatened Suicide and Her
/Sister Hints at an Es
trangement.
A young New York Jeweler, evidently a
college man and reputed to have once
been wealthy, committed suicide In the
Eugene, a rooming house at 265 O'Farrell
street. Sunday afternoon. Chauncey A.
Hawkins was the despondent man's nsune,
and he killed himself by taking morphine.
He left a letter giving financial troubles
and lack of employment as the causes of
his desire for death. But an estrange
ment with his wife is hinted at.
Hawkins'., wife resides at 752 South
Spring street, Los Angeles. He came to
The Eugene a week ago and little is
known of him. On Sunday at 11 a. m.
the Japanese bedmaker knocked at "the
door for the purpose of making the bed
and was answered by Hawkins from
within that he need not come in, as he
was turning In for a nap. The body was
found yesterday forenoon and decomposi
tion had proceeded_so fast that-the corpse
was black and the. air -of the room was
unbearable. In the right hand of the
dead man was ' a handkerchief pressed
against the nostrils, and in' the vest
pocket was a paper box containing mor
phine.
Letters found on the person of the sui
cide'showed that he was a jeweler and
had but recently arrived from New York
City, where he had many college friends,
who seemed to be very much surprised
at his recent marriage. On the bureau of
the room in which Hawkins died was a
letter written in pencil and addressed to
Mrs. C. A. Hawkins, 751 South Spring
etreet, Los Angeles. It was dated June 7,
1900, and was despondent in tone. The fol
lowing' are extracts:
"Neither Shreve nor other Jewelers
could offer me anything till fall. But
when Sunday I learned that Thayer had
gone 1 began to feel that the end was
not far off, and when on Monday I found
out from a clergyman tnat Church would
not be here till July, then I knew it. For
give me, though it Is a thing I little de
serve; yet forgive me and pray for me,
for I shall need your prayers. Once more,
dear, 1 embrace you and entreat you to.
if it be possible, remember me for good.
â¢ When Mrs. Hawkins was seen, last night
at the Victoria Hotel, in Los Angeles,
where she occupies a suite, she was too
ill to converse at arn' length regarding
the death of. her husband. She Jiad not
been officially notified of his demise and
clung to the hope that an error in Iden
tity had been made.
"There are many Hawkinses in this
world," she said.
The widow's sister stated that Hawkins
came to Los Angeles one and a half years
ago and that at one time he was wealthy,
but was not now, and had gone to San
Francisco a week ago to seek employ
ment. He managed some years ago a
jewelry business in New York City, she
said.
While he was but 23 years of age, Haw
kins' suicide was not unexpected. Mrs.
Hawkins said that he had threatened to
do away with himself on many previous
occasions. Ho leaves no children and be
sides his wife his only known relative is
Mrs. C. M. Hawkins, 350 Fulton street,
Jamaica, N. Y. â¢
That a possible estrangement existed
between husband and wife is based on
the statement made bv the sister that the
deceased had always said that he pre
ferred and so wished that his mother
should be notified of his death and that
she would look after, his remains. .

An ordinance was passed to print at year
terday's meeting of the Board of Super
visors Imposing license taxes upon per
sons, firms and corporations engaged in
the business of loaning money at interest,
receiving deposits, discounting notes or
warrants or buying and selling gold and
silver coin or currency or notes or bills of
exchange and sold anjd silver bullion: also
providing for the examination by the Tax
Collector of such persons, firms and cor
porations touching the amount of their
receipts. Following are the graduated
licenses r Those whose total receipts shall
exceed the sum of $2,000,000 per quarter
shall pay a license of $600 per quarter;
over $1,000,000 and less than $1,500,000, $400
per quarter; over $500,000 and less than
$1,000,000, $200 per quarter; under $500,000,
$100 per quarter.
Each license Issued under the provisions
of the ordinance is to be designated
"banker's license," and a sworn statement
or an affidavit must be made that all
questions touching the receipts have been
truly answered.
Tho effect of the ordinance will be that
in future large revenues will accrue to the
city from the bank3 that hitherto have
been practically exempt from license
taxes.
On Brandenstpin's motion the Judiciary
Committee was directed, to frame an or
dinance raising the license on pawnbrok
ers from $31 to $60 per quarter.
The ordinance providing for the ex
tension of tne pound limits to the county
line was up for final passage before the
board. After a long discussion, in which
citizens were heard on both sides of the
question, the bill was referred to the Joint
committee on Police and Streets for ac
tion. The committee will meet Wednes
day, June 20, at 4 p. m., to hear final ar
gument.
Garret McEnerney. attorney for the
Dairymen's Union, addressed the board in
opposition to the proposed ordinance. He
represented that it it were passed it would
be impossible for the members of the as
sociation to conduct their business, as it
would be under the surveillance of the
poundkeeper. The industry had $100,000 in
vested, a payroll of ?G0O0 and 2000 men em
ployed. The land occupied for dairy uses
was not tit for any other purpose and the
owners would be driven el3ewhere. Mc-
Enerney was followed on the same lines
by M. Johnson, chairman of the Dairy
men's Union; Henry Levy of the Butch
ers' Board of Trade, II. < Sherwood of the
Produce Kxchange and T. J. Parsons of
the State Board of Trade. Mr. Parsons
held that no onorous restriction should
be placed on a legitimate business that
was not detrimental to the interests of the
community.
C. J{. Holbrook, secretary of tiie So
ciety" for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals, denied a charge made by one of the
speakers that the pound employes had
broken down fences and allowed cattle to
escape.
Reed said that something should
be done to prevent cattle from roaming
about the public streets. He advised cer
tain regulations on that point without ex
tending the pound limits to where the ac
tual busfness of dairying Is carried on.
His motion to recommit the ordinance to
a joint committee prevailed.
Miscellaneous Business.
An ordinance imposing a license of $100

NINTH OF SEPTEMBER
HEADQUARTERS OPENED
Four Booms in Palace- Hotel Secured
for Transaction of Celebra
tion Business.'
-Will D. Shea, secretary of the joint Dth
of September celebration of the Native
Sons of the Golden West, has opened
headquarters in rooms 190. 191, 192 and 193
on the lirst floor of the Palace Hotel.
One of the rooms has been fitted up for
the use of the secretary and his assist
ant, Charles A. Boldemann, and there
during the day and evening any one hav
ing business with the committee in con
nection with the celebration will find some
one in constant attendance to impart such
information as may be desired.
All communications intended for the
committee should be addressed to these
headquarters. As soon as it becomes gen
erally known that they have been opened
there will no doubt be busy times there.
The other three rooms have been fitted
up for the use of the sub-committees and
the grand marshal, S. V. Costello. That
official will visit the headquarters daily
for the purpose of keeping in touch with
the work of the sub-committees and re
ceiving ideas in relation to the grand pa
rade which is being planned.
The joint committee will hold a meet
ing next Friday evening in Native Sons'
Hall, when one of the members will make
a motion that at the succeeding one each
member of the committee, numbering
about 150. present one or more suggestions
as to what would make an attractive fea
ture for the celebration, hoping in that
manner to obtain a great number of ideas
and preventing any one after the cele
bration from saying that he did not have
an opportunity of offering something that
would have been a very attractive card.
The parade committee will meet in the
new headquarters to-morrow night to can
vass what has already been done by the
individual members.
A number of- ideas have already been
offered as to floats for the parade. One
of these is tha,t there should a model
of the first public school that stood on
Portsmouth Square, or the Plaza, as it
was called in early days, and that John
C. Pelton, the pioneer educator, who waa
the first teacher, should occupy a place on
that float.
