FUTURE PLANS OF
BOER PEACE ENVOYS
WASHINGTON. May 23.-Mr. Fischer,
one of the Boer envoys, spoke freely with
a representative of the Associated Press
to-day as to their general plans for tho
future. He said that it was their purpose
to visit ten or twelve of the principal
cities of the United States and to explain
to the people whatever they might wish
to know of their cause. They came to
plead with the whole, American people for
sympathy and support
The cities which they will visit have not
yet been determined upon, and In making
their selections they will be guided by
their friends. It Is probable, however,
that they yrill eventually reach San
Francisco, stopping en route at Chicago,
Milwaukee, St. Louis and Cincinnati.
Other cities have also been mentioned.
The envoys hope to complete their tour of
the country within two months and be
ready to leave for Europe, where they
have planned to do Important work. Mr.
Fischer said that they did not contem
plate making any pet speeches, but
would give the people plain talks, the sub
jects of which would depend entirely upon
what particular phase of the great ques
tion at lseue the people desired; to be ln-
detached parties in various parts of the
Trrnsvaal.
Krusrr rarely leaves the presidency
now. but works incessantly, holding coun
cils at daybreak and during the night. It
was announced at Pretoria on Sunday
that the Government proposed removing
the British prisoners from Pretoria.

There is no longer any doubt that the

The Boers are retiring toward the Vaal

BOERS FLEEING BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF BRITISH TROOPS.
Details of Final Which;
Culminated in the Relief of
the Beleaguered Mafeking
Garrison.
LONDON, May 23.-The War Office
issued a. dispatch from Lord Rob
erts, under date of Honlngs Spruit,
May 22, announcing the receipt by
him of the following message from
Major General Baden-Powell:
"MAFEKING, May 17.â I am happy to
Inform you that Mafeking was success
fully relieved to-day. The northern and
southern columns joined hands on May 13
and attacked the enemy yesterday, and
after a small engagement entirely defeat
ed them with loss. The British casualties
were three killed and twenty-two
wounded.
"The relieving force marched into Mafe
king at 9 this morning and the relief and
defense forces combined and moved out
and attacked the enemy's head laager.
We shelled them out and nearly captured
Snyman and took one gun, a flag and a
largo amount of ammunition, stores, etc.
Five dead and fifteen wounded Boers were
found. The enemy appears to be retreat-
Ing in all directions, except one com
mando, which is lying low, possibly to
cover the retreat of the remainder.
"Captain MacLarcn and Corporal Mur
ray were found in the Boer hospital. They
are doing well. The townspeople and the
garrison of Mafeking are heartily grate
ful for their relief."
MAFEKING, May 18.â The whole town
is animated with a keen sense of exulta
tion over yesterday's victory, which was
complete, decisive and far-reaching. All
the outlying works of the town were In
tact; the British had lost hardly any men
and yet three bodies of Federals, right in
side the British lines, had been surround
ed, cut off and given an opportunity to
surrender. Which they had declined.
. Commandant Sarel Eloff did not realize
that his supports had been driven back,
and he informed a messenger that the
town was at his mercy. Toward noon
there was a lull In the fighting. Every
body at headquarters went to breakfast
and the commissariat commissioned for
horse sausage, bread and water for the
men on the fighting line. There was no
thought of half rations. Every one got
all he could eat.
The British In the staat, moving from
rock to rock, gradually drew in their cir
cle around tho Federals, whom they cor
raled like cattle in a compound. Shortly
after 4:30 a white flag was hoisted by the
enemy, and then, amid ringing cheers,
the first batch of Boers was disarmed and
sent to the town. The erstwhile besieg
ers furnished an inspiring spectacle to
the townsfolk, themselves so long cooped
up. As the hungry, dirty, battle-stained
Boers marched between the gleaming
bayonets of the British, the British popu
lation received them respectfully, but the
Kaffirs gave full rein to their enthusiasm
In hoots, yells and similar expressions of
delight. The prisoners seemed glad the
light was over.
As the afternoon advanced the crackle
of musketry began again, continuing un
til nearly 7 o'clock, when Captain Single
ton shouted "Coase fire!" A message had
come from headquarters to the effect that
Eloff, his officers and men had surrender
ed and had lain down their arms uncon
ditionally to Colonel Hore, who, with a
handful of men, had been a prisoner of
Elon* during most of the day.
Shortly before this a fusillade was
heard. It was Eloff and the men who
stood by him firing on their own desert
ers, eighty of whom fled. As the news
spread by telephone to the garrisons of
the various forts cheer upon cheer re
sounded. In the town some one shouted
"God save the Queen," and the strains
of the national anthem mingled for a
few minutes with the hoarse shouting of
the natives.
Soon Captain Singleton and Colonel
Hore approached, accompanied by Com
mandant ElofT and his officers. The meet
ing between Colonel Baden-Powell and
the Boer commandant was dramatic.
"This is Commandant Eloff, elr," said
Captain Singleton.
"Good evening, commandant," said Col
onel Baden-Powell. "Welcome, and have
some dinner."
As the British had already captured 120
prisoners, about, all they could handle.
Colonel Baden-Powell sent word to Lord
Chase Bentenck to open the way and to
allow the scattered remnants of the Fed
erals to be driven from the staat. In
half an hour everything was over and In
the messroom'at headquarters the three
Boer officers were dining.
Nearly every mess in town raked up
somewhere a hidden store of liquor, a hot*
tie of champagne in one place, a flask of
whisky in another. 'The whole town Join
ed In the Jubilation, singing. "God Save
the Queen" and other patriotic songs all
night long.
The rank and file of the Boer prisoners
were lodged at Masonic Hall. Most of
them are Johannesburg Boers. They
seemed in excellent spirits, scrambled for
the blankets Issued, wrote letters to their
friends and grumbled at General Sny
man.
The people have confidence In William Mc-
Klnley. No President while he was President !
had the confidence of the people to the degree
that President McKlnley has it. Other Presi
dents have been canonized after death and it
has been evidenced then that they had the
confidence of the people; but no person In office
ever escaped the criticism and innuendo that
McKlnley has escaped. The people would be
glad to leave this investigation to him. Thfy
know there would be no condonlns of fraud, no
covering up of crime. But when charges are
made simply for campaign purposes I think we
may as well make an investigation for our-
Further along Platt paid a high tribute
to General Wood, General Brooke and
others, and said no army officer has been
even charged with anything like fraud in
Cuba.
"lias the Senator had his attention di
rected to the railroad construction along
the south side of the harbor of Havana?"
inquired Tillman.
"If the Senator," retorted Platt,
warmly, "has any information as to that
railroad, I wish he would produce it."
"I did not say I had any information."
said Tillman, "but if there is an investi
gation I will produce some witnesses."
Referring to the construction of this
railroad, Platt said the names of Former
Secretary of War Alger and Senators
'Platt and Depew had beep used in connec
tion with the project, but they had en
tered vigorous denials of any connection
with It, although to his mind such denials
were unnecessary.
â¢'These charges simply show the reck
lessness of those people who are throwing
stones at the present administration," he
said
Bathbone Not to Be Shielded.
Platt said there would be no disposition
to protect Director Rathbone if he should
be shown to be Involved in the financial
difficulties in Cuba. If he were found to
be guilty he would be punished unspar
ingly.
Bacon, he said, demanded to know why
our Government was in Cuba, and why it
did not come away. i .->
Â¦â¢We are there." Platt answered, "be
cause, we have been sent there by the
American people; because Congress has
sent our army there to destroy the power
of Spain. "We have a duty yet to perform
there, and the American people will see to
it that it is discharged. . Our military
control of the island will cease when the
â¢ people set up for themselves a govern-
ment for the proper control of ths
Island."
"When will that time come?" Inquired
Bacon.
"That time will be delayed long." re
torted Platt. "if a party for partisan pur
poses makes the work more difficult. The
blush of shame ought to mantle the cheek
of every man who is trying to hinder or
embarrass the operation of General Wood
In Cuba, who is seeking to brinfj about
that time as rapidly as it may be brought
about."
Spooner resumed his speech on the Fhil
ippine question.! Incidentally he referred
to the situation In Cuba and our respon
sibility there. Hale of Maine interrupt
ed him to say that In view of what had
happened in Cuta it would have been bet
ter had we abandoned it.
"Does the Senator think," inquired
Spooner. "In the case I have put we
should have abandoned Cuba?"
Should Have Abandoned Cuba.
"I think it would have been the best
thing in the world for us if we had done
It," replied Hale. "I think if It were
found that the population in Cuba was |
as hostile to U3 as it had been to Opain.
we should have abandoned and been glad
to get rid of it."
"Well," replied Spooner, "that is a mat
ter of opinion. In the case I have put
I believe we should have taken Cuba and
held it, giving to the people of Cuba what
they never had had in the worldâindivid
ual liberty and good government."
Haleâ The Senator has more confidence than
I have in the experiment we are trying to
day of teaching the people of Cuba honesty and
gcod government. I think we would have
been better off If we had not taught the
Cubans the lesson that has been taught In
the last few months.
Spoonerâ V.'hat lesson?
Haleâ The lesson of fraud, peculations, cheat-
Ing, appropriation of revenues, stealing, a car
nival In every direction of corruption and
fraud.
Spooner (warmly)â It Is a llttls ttrescnv? for
me to be called upon on this side of the Cham
ber to reply to a Democratic ri>?ech.
Haloâ I am as good a Republican as the Sen
ator from Wisconsin. I do not recognize any
party obligations to compel me to consent to
the proposition that everything has gone right
in Cuba.
Spocncrâ Nobody pretends it.
Haleâ I do r.ot think thÂ« experiment has been
a failure. I would vote to-ir.crrow to with
draw from Cuba and leave that people to eÂ»
tablirh and set up and maintain their own
government. The time will come when Re
publicans will be glad when we get out of
this thing without worse th'.nga happening
than are now. ,
Spooner â What does thÂ« Senator mean when
â¢ he sreaks in general terms of h carnival of
fraud and corruption? . ' ' Â¦â¢Â¦â¢-.
Haleâ I mean the things disclosed. A bill
of particulars has been filed already. It ' is
not the administration at fault. It Is a nat
ural result. There never has been an Instance
of the setting up' of a supremo government in
a colony of dependency that has not been
attended with practically the same things that
we have seen in Cuba. The Congress Is as
much at fault. The administration has selected
men who are believed to be good men. We
went Into it with utter confidence, believing
that it was an easy thing. I voted against
the peace treaty because I telleved colonial
dependencies would result in precisely what
lias occurred. I am glad, too. I am glad
to sÂ»e that the administration Is trying to
pvard It, but I do net want anybody to say
thit It Is an unexpected thing.
Spoonerâ So far as anything I said is con- )
cerned, the Senator's observations are, in the
language of Shakespeare. "A bolt of nothing
shot Â¦ at nothing." We went to war to free
Cuba. Have we done Cuba and the Cuban*
no kindness by pouring out millions of our men
and shedding the blood of our soldiers, in
order to drive Spanish tyranny forever from
Cuba? Has the Senator any suspicion In his
mind or in his heart that the pledge made In
the resolution passed by Congress as to the
temporary character of our occupation in Cuba
is not to be kept?
Â¦ Nation's Honor Endangered.
Haleâ I have very grave suspicions. I think
there are very powerful Influences in this
country, largely located in Xew York City,
largely speculative and connected with money
maklns; enterprises, that are determined that
we Khali never give up Cuba. I think that
the time will never come, unless something
earnest and drastic Is done by Congress, that
the last soldier of the United States will be
withdrawn from Cuban soil. I do not think the
President favors holding Cuba. . I discovered
very powerful influences, commercial, mercan
tile, money and political, that are opposed to
our ever withdrawing from Cuba. I take up
*.he newspapers that are foremost in the large
cities, and I find every day intimation and
hints that we are never to withdraw from
Cuba.
Spooner â If I were Inclined to doubt tor one
moment that the United States Government
will seasonably withdraw from Cuba, I should
be ashamed of the. Government acd ashamed of
its action.
Hale â That assurance from the Senator more
than repays me for all that I have said. I
shall count upon. him in the future.
Spoonerâ To say that the Senator will count
upon me in the future Is little less than an
Insult. This is a Government of honor, and
It Is a people of honor. "When the Senator
expresses a fear that the pledge of this Gov
ernment will be- allowed to slumber by the
voice of commercialism, he degrades the peo
ple and underestimates their Integrity. This
administration is going forward to : redeem to
its utmost the pledge to Cuba.
In reply to Spooler's defense of this
Government's action in Cuba, Tillman of
South Carolina declared that our agents!
on the island were carpet-baggers, and
the sooner they got out the better. :;'<,
"Oh," replied Spooner, "If the Senator
from South Carolina finds a carpet-bag-
WASHINGTON. May 23.â This
was a day of rasping political
controversy and oratory in the
Berate. With the controversy
those on the Democratic side
of the chamber, anomalous as it may
seem, had little to do". What by far
seeing Senators is regarded as likely to be
the paramount issue of the approaching
national campaign was the subject of two
notable speechesâ one by Platt of Con
necticut and the other by Spconer of Wis
consin. The former was an answer to
the speech delivered a few days ago by
Bacon of Georgia on his resolution de
manding an investigation of linanciftl con
ditions in Cuba. Platt ' favored the adop
tion of the resolution, but deprecated
what he declared was a cheap effort to
make politicil capital out of a shameful
condition cf affairs, which the Republican,
rarty needed no prodding to induce it to
probe to the bottom.
The speech of Spooner was a continua
tion of his address of yesterday on the
Philippine question. In its course he be
carrie involved in a heated and sensational
colloquy with Hale of Maine over the
Government's conduct of affairs in our
"insular possessions." It was a remarka
ble controversy between two of tbe best
equipped debators in the Senate and v*as
listened to with profound attention by
Senators, many Representatives and
crowded galleries.
Wood Detected the Fraud.
In bringing up the Cuban frauds Platt
of Connecticut, who is chairman of the
Committee on Relations with Cuba, said:
About a month ago General Wood, the Gov
ernor General of Cuba, was led to suppose that
there had been irregularities in that portion of
the government of Cuba under the supervision
of the Director of Posts. lie immediately or
ganized an inspection, which has been un
sperinely pressed.
The Senator from Georgia (Bacon) seems to
think, as do some of the newspapers, that all
the malfeasance In office and fraud have been
brought to light not by the United States Gov
ernment offlclajs, but by outsiders. But it is
to General Wood that the credit of the discov
ery of these frauds and wrongdoings belongs,
and to the administration belongs the credit of
the problnz to the bottom of these fraud3.
The Senator 'rom Georgia has no monopoly on
the Bhame 1....1 humiliation with which every
patriotic man is affected by recent disclosures.
They are shockinE. They are a direct blow to
every true citizen of the United States. If
the wronpdolnK had occurred in Boston, New
York or Washington it would have been sad
and Ehameful. but it would not have tx-en so
.sad and shameful as It Js. since it occurred on
the island of Cuba, where the administration
Is engaged in a great work of freedom and
philanthropy.
Platt said that for Congress to interfere
with the Investigation instituted by the
Postmaster ..General â¢ might '. defeat tho
ends of Justice, and he announced that
the department Investigation would be
thorough and searching. He then read a
letter from Postmaster General Smith to
Fourth Assistant Bristow, who is charged
with conducting the investigation. The
letter gave tho strictest instructions for
the prosecution of the Inquiry', and urged
that every guilty man be brought to jus
tice
President Will Not Waver.
Continuing Platt said:

Further Evidence by the War
Department.

"The Washinpton Government entirely

is quite right that Washington should

but the Ix-mocrats objected to the lan

ThfÂ» Democrats wanted the bill to apply

communication from Abraham Ffschep, one of the Beer delegates now in the
United States, advising him to surrender on the best terms obtainable from Lord

the corner of Twenty-third and Cass ave
nue, in order that a barricade which had
been placed across the track might be

FILIPINOS YET
PLACING HOPE
IN DEMOCRACY
Loaned Its Credit to Outside Enter
prises and Permitted Its Work
ing Capital to Become
Exhausted.
; â â¢ .
CHICAGO, May 23.â Agent Mains, rep
resentative of the Methodist Publishing
interests In Now York, was kept busy
for an hour / to-day explaining certain
portions of his quadrennial report to the
committee on book concern. Chairman
Frank Arter of the sub-committee, to
which was referred the report of the
publishing agent in the East, submitted
a statement which will in all probability
cause a sensation when it reaches . the
General Conference. It calls attention to
the fact that the Eastern publishing
houpe has permitted its working capital
to become exhausted, while it has loaned
its credit to outside enterprises. One case
of the kind referred to in the report is
that of the International Bible Society.
According to the report this concern or its
representatives has owed the publishing
house $51,000 for several years and appar
ently no effort has been made to adjust
the account.
The report also stated that the Eastern
house had paid large dividends and subsi
dies without reducing its liabilities.
The committee on episcopacy to-night
considered a protest signed by t the presi
dents of all the Methodist educational in
stitutions of the country and aimed at
Bishop Hurst and his American Univer
sity, demanding that steps be taken to
check the general superintendents of the
church in their tendency to use the episco
pal office as a club to force subscriptions
for the benefit of colleges in which they
were interested. -The protest was referred
to a special committee of seven, which
met after the adjournment of the main
body, and will report to-morrow.
Another matter of importance was the
report of the sub-committee, fixing the
episcopal residences for the coming quad
rennium. Much disaffection developed at
the report and after some discussion fur
ther consideration was deferred until to
morrow. Here is the list as submitted to
the committee to-night: Boston. New
York, Philadelphia. Buffalo. Cincinnati,
Chicago, Detroit. St. Louis, Topeka. Min
neapolis. San Francisco. Portland. Or.,
and Chattanooga, with the committee un
decided whether to report in favor of
Washington or Denver. The indecision in
regard to the continuation of an episcopal
residence in the the capital city was re
garded as another blow to Bishop Hurst.
The General Conference to-day voted to
abolish the time limit on pastorates.
Work of the Presbyterians.
ST. LOUIS, May 23.â Advancement was

what action they desire to take, if any.
in the revision of the creed and in the
election of Dr. William B. Xole of Cali
fornia as- permanent clerk. Although the
afternoon session was fraught wirh un
usual interest there was no dramatic sit
uation. Speakers for and against revision
occupied the floor and made speeches an<J
the most friendly spirit pre\-ailed.
The adoption of the report of the com
mittee on bills and overtures, relating to
the appointment of the revision commit
tee by the assembly, was received with
great satisfaction. Scarcely less enthusi
asm was manifested during the election
of the permanent clerk. "

OAKLAND. May 23.â Frederick W.

Agnews Insane Asylum for several
months and later released as cured, waa

M0WRY SAYS HE WAS
COMMANDED BY SPIRITS
Fellow Teachers: We are again
assembled in our annual institute. I
trust that the programme of exercises
will prove acceptable and profitable
to you all. It contains the names of
those -who are acknowledged masters
of the themes they will discuss. We
are here for the exchange of thought
and experience and the acquisition of
new thought, in order that the sari
ous responsibilities imposed upon us
as teachers may be more effectively
and conscientiously assumed and dis
charged. â Excerpt from address by
President Webster.
WHEN Superintendent of Schools
R. H. Webster as president of
the Teachers' Institute opened
the initial session of that body
yesterday morning there was not a va
cant seat in the large auditorium of the
MlsBion High School. More than six hun
dred teachers were In attendance and
manifested great interest in. the papers
and remarks of those who contributed to
the programme.
The institute Is practically a school of
Instruction for those who devote their
lives to teaching the young Idea to shoot.
The session will last three days, and dur
ing that time the presiding geniuses of
the classroom are expected to be present
and absorb the latest wrinkles in edu
cation, so that they can return to their
various schools better prepared to incul
cate wisdom in the minds of their pupils.
R. H. Webster presided over the delib
erations of the body, and he was given
able assistance by Secretary Miss Mary
'Scherer and Assistant Secretaries Miss
Louise A. Renwick and Miss Nellie Arm
strong. The profcramme was opened at
9:30 with singins by the eighth and ninth
grades of the Clement Grammar School,
taught by Miss Frances Lewie, and under
the direction of Miss Estelle Carpenter,
The children's voices blended nicely In
the Â«=inpinjr of "Hark, What Heavenly
Voices. The rendition of this beautiful
selection was heartily appreciated, and
for an encore "Suwanee River" was sunn.
Charles Parmenter, the right half of the
victorious Clement football team, sang
the solo to the beautiful melody and his
fellow pupils Joined in the chorus.
The opening address was then delivered
by Mr. Webster, and in part he said:
The Interest manifested in education marks
the development of a community. Industry
and even progress to a considerable degree may
exist where the standard of education is com
monplace, but the larger forces that push out
and eonqufy. that dispel darkness and make
the fondest hopes seem reasonable ambitions,
must rest upon the base of high and conscien
tious scholarship.
The powers that control the affairs of this
republic believe with Aristotle., that "a Ptate
cin be no better than the citizens of which
It is composed"; and with Dionysius that "the
foundation of every state Is the education of
Its youth." President McKtriley nobly said,
"This nation, if it would continue to lead In

SEVERE STORM
SWEEPS OVER THE
NORTHWEST
Boats Capsized and Two
Men Known to Have
Been Drowned.
In the City of Astoria the Wind Blew
With Frightful Velocity and
Slucii Property Was
Damaged.
Special r>Â«.Â«ratca to Tb* Call.
ASTORIA. Or.. May 23.â One of the most
severe storms which ever raged over the
North vest in May sprang up this morn
ir.g. The- wind blew in squalls and at
time? its velocity was so great that tin
roofs were tern off buildings in the city.
The storm played havoc with the fisher
men on the river, and no less than twenty
boats Â¦were capsized.
Two men are known to have been
drowned, and it is feared four or five
others have met a similar fate. The first
drowning occurred off Fort Columbia,
where tho boat of Albert Johnson was
overturned during a squall. Johnson's
boat-puller, a man named Peterson, was
rescued by other fishermen, but Johnson
was lost. The second drowning occurred
near Fort Stevens. A boat manned by
Mike Peltoma and John Brown was cap
sized about 4 o'clock. Brown held on to
some tra;> poles until the Fort Stevens
life crew reached him, but Peltoma be
came entangled in the meshes of his web
and was drowned. While the life crew
was bringrinp: Peltoma's body to the city,
two other fishermen were saved from a
watery grave. The men were John Paso
lich and Antone Talzantich.
The ftorm was so severe that their boat
refused to mind its rudder and capsized.
The men had be*>n In the water nearly an
hour when the life crew came along:, and
were almost dead. A scow carrying six
men loft Astoria for Fort Canby this aft
ernoon, but the steamer was compelled
to drop her tow. The men on the scow
dropped thÂ«Â» anchor, which held for a
time, but finally gave way. At a late
hour to-night nothing had been heard of
the scow and It Is feared she foundered.
There is a bare possibility that the six
men reached shore. It Is reported that
three other fishermen were lost about dark
to-night, but the report cannot be veri
fied. The number of men actually lost
â¢will not be known until to-morrow.
To-day's storm was the most severe one
for the month for years. A heavier blow
occurred in May. 1SS1. Then ninety fish
ermen were drowned In a single night.
EIGHT HUNDRED BOERS
SURRENDER AT VRYBURG
Continued from First Pace
Ninthâ The adoption of a course of study
which will not be too revolutionary, but along
the lines of modern educational thought.
Tenth â To devise a plan of overcoming the
evils of the unyielding graded system.
Eleventhâ The formation of a class for deaf
Twelfthâ Manual training, including sloyd,
cookinsr and sewing.
Thirteenthâ The strengthening of the draw
ing department.
Fourteenthâ An attempt to amend the com
pulsory education law, by the establishment
of a truant school, organized by teachers es
pecially adapted for that kind of work, and
ateo by truant officers.
Fifteenth â The reorganization of the teaching
of -physical culture, and placing it in the de
partment on a proper basis.
Sixteenthâ As soon as possible, the introduc
tion of nature study in our department.
Seventeenthâ The board intends to assist and
o-operate with the San KraneJsco Btate Nor
mal School in establishing a model training
school for the proper preparation of attending
teachers, and also where we can go and re
ceive new Inspiration along the proper methods
of Instruction.
Our system of education, to realize its high- I
eft aim, must reach the common people, the
"plain people," as Lincoln loved to call them.
It must be remembered that 93 per cent of
the children can never receive more than an
elementary education, and, therefore, it is the
highest duty of the Etate to determine the
character and quality of the education which
will best prepare them for their life work as in- I
divlduals and as citizens of the republic. Edu
cation should awaken In the mind of the youth
a desire for good literature; It should at the
snmc time teach htm an honorable means by
which he may obtain those material things
he desires. It should Inspire him with thoughts
of hlcher Ideals, right aspirations and a
sense of moral responsibility. In the practical
operation of these sentiments there is honor
and strength and long life for our institutions.
For the permanence of the civil compact de
pends less upon a wide diffusion of unasslm
ilated and undigested intelligence, than upon
such a practical moral education of the youth
as shall enable them to secure ana qualify
them to store up a fair share of the aggregate
produce of labor. Therefore It is being dally
demonstrated that the highest degree of edu
cation results from combining manual with
intellectual and moral training.
C. W. Mark, president of the Board of
Education, was next introduced and read
a paper on "Our City School System." He
discussed the changes made by the Board
of Education and told what the board in
tended doing with a view to improving
the school system In this city. Â¦ These
changes would be brought about by de
grees and Include:
Firstâ The centralization of responsibility in
the principals.
Second â Supervision of the schools by experts
along certain lines, for the purpose of strength
ening and Improving all of us in our work.
Thirdâ Conducting the department on strict
business principles.
Fourthâ The appointment of teachers to the
department on merit, and not for personal or
political reasons.
Fifth â As far as is possible the treating of
all schools alike, giving them the same priv
ileges and the same advantages.
Sixthâ A rational method of promotion of
pupils.
Seventhâ The Introduction of children's play
grounds.
Eighth â The establishment of vacation
classes.
the race of progress' and liberty, must do It
through the intelligence and conscience of its
people." We all accept the modern gospel.
"Seek ve first the education cf the people and
all other blessings will ba added unto you."
At the conclusion of the discussion of
the subject a recess for five minutes was
taken. On reconvening a male quartet,
composed of J. F. Veaco, W. C. Stadtfeld.
B. Somers and William Nielson, rendered
"Annie Laurie." and for an encore
"Schneider's Band." This was followed
by a talk on physical culture and general
care of the body by John E>. Hoover.
M D , LL.D. The professor was assisted
in his lecture by sixty of his pupils, who
ranged in years from 7 to 70.
Owinj? to the length of the programme
Mrs M. I*. O'Neal president of the
Laguna Honda School, postponed her lec
ture until to-morrow's session. An ad
journment was taken until this morning
at 9 o'clock.
But permanency of tenure cannot exist unless
appointments are made for merit. Also the
system cannot work well unless there Is a
probationary system that will determine
whether the teachers are qualified for the po
sitions. Thirdly, no twentieth century city can
afford to have permanency of tenure without a
system of retirement on annuities. I must con
fess that I have been a long time In coming
to that conclusion.
We have lived in the nineteenth century and
have tried to be nineteenth century men and
women. Can we now face the twentieth cen
tury and be twentieth century men and women?
That is the crucial question that confronts us
one and all to-day.
We want to deal with educational questions
as questions not of the past but as questions
of the present and the future. There is a fine
old saying that I should like to repeat in this
connection. It is an Anglo-Saxon saying: "To
day Is a new day." For a preat body of teach
ers this Is a peculiarly fitting time for us to
regard our work In this way. The one great
corollary of the permanent tenure of office
is this. The permanency of tenure is main
tained r.ot for the individual benefit of the
teacher, but for the benefit of the public. It Is
for you who have this tenure to show that this
is so. You don't want to make it simply se
cure, but to make it appeal to the public as the
best thing for the schools; that it means not
only good teaching, but increasingly good teach
ing. I suppose next to a bad man in the world
Is a bad man who is growing worse; but worse
than him is a good man who is not growing
better. The worst kind of a teacher is a good
teacher who is not growing better.
Every teacher needs to have an intellectual
hobby. Every teacher ought to have some spe
cial subject that he or snÂ«- is learning thor
oughlyâsomething worth while In which you
are daily becoming a scholar. Then In your
study of the educational programme get above
the commonplaces of pedagogy. Thirdly, learn
to love the children more; and the best way
to do that is to do things for them that will
One of the peculiar things about the San
FranciBco body of teachers is that character
which they have stamped upon them by reason
of the fact that they have permanency of ten
ure in their positions. That fact gives them
confidence and increases their self-respect.
From the bottom of my heart I can say I be
lieve in the wisdom of the- system of perma-
Tha purpose of an Institute is to" give us an
opportunity to view our work as a part of the
larger work of life.
"The Bandolero," a pretty ballad by
Stuart, was sung by Herbert E. Medley,
who rendered "Israfel" as an encore.
Then followed a talk on "Some Corollar
ies of the Permanent Tenure and Pur
poses of a Teachers' Institute" by Elmer
Ellsworth Brown. Ph.D., professor of the
theory and practice of education. Univer
sity of California. In part he said:
Highland Park. Charles R. Eastman was
the only graduate from the classical
course though four completed the aca
demic course and graduated last night.
Charles R. Eastman, the college gradÂ»
uate. delivered an address upon secondary
schools In Â¦which he declared that present
courses are filled with useless studies.
"This work of preparing students for
life." said he. "Is crowded out by studies
that have no place in secondary schools.
If a student enters a classical course. hfÂ»
must study Greek. There seems to twÂ»
only two reasons for continuing thla
study: first, a respect for the ancient,
and second, an endeavor to do what tho
college would do. To-day we have thÂ«
French and German languages absolute
necessities in some vocations."
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of tha
State University, delivered an address
upon "Our Duty to the Commonwealth."
after which the college dinner was given.
The graduates from the academic de
partment were: W. Clifford Pruett, Oak
land; C. Roy Browning, Loomis; Maud
XI. Sears. Eureka, and Mary L. Gall
breath. Tulare.
Mr. Adams closed his lecture by recit
ing the exquisite lines of "Lead, Kindly
Light," the hymn written by Newman
that has found its way into the hearts
of Christians throughout the world. Mr.
Adams will lecture again In Metropolitan
Hall to-morrow njght? on "Novels."
His struggles against criticism; his cool,
calm courage In defense of his principles
and his dignified silence when he himself
was assailed, brought a fervent tribute
from the lecturer, and then he described
the death of the great man, bowed with
the weight of ninety years, but with his
mind Btlll vigorous and his charity, hl.Â«
integrity, his gentle, lovable nature and
his giant intellect the theme of even those
who had been his enemies.
"Cardinal Newman," said the speaker,
"was a fixed idea and In his character,
cutting into the sensuality, the material
ism and the protestantism of his age.
might be seen the man with fixity of pur
pose; the man of one idea. God stamped
upon his soul not only the quality of
fixity of purpose, but transfiguration. In
his infancy his soul made this compact
with God: 'If I see the light there I will
go to It; and If I see It there I will go
to it; I will go to It though all the world
should bid me stay; even though, when
1 He down at night I will have but twi>
friendsâ God and John Henry Newman!' "
Newman's early life was then described,
his career at Oxford and his appointment
as rector of the church of St. Mary the
Virgin at Oxford, where he preached to
the learned philosophers of the college,
roused them from their lethargy and
started the great Oxford movement. And
then the speaker told how in his forty
fifth year, with the power of his Intellect
thrilling the clergy and laity of England
and the sweep of his Influence over the
nation's Intellectual development, New
man saw the light leading him to the
Church of Rome, and without a moment's
hesitation he followed it.
In his opening remarks the speaker re
ferred to Cardinal Newman as one of tho
greatest men of the century; a man who,
reared in the rigid principles of the Cal
vlnistic faith, had risen by his preaching
until he held the hearts and the intel
lects of England in his hand; had come
to be a teacher of teachers and a coun
selor of the wise, and had then, in tho
prime of .his- manhood and his power,
turned his back on all he had gained.
Joined the Catholic faith and battled
against the tide of prejudice and vilifica
tion for nearly fifty years; dying with his
battle won, his enemies silenced and all
enmity at an end.
Under the auspices of the Catholic
Truth Society Henry Austin Adams
lectured last evening on "Cardinal New
man." His was not a simple enumeration
of the events in the life of the great pre
late; Â¦ It was Â¦ a story, dealing, with thi:
character of the man, hl3 wonderful in
tellect, his fixity of purpose, his tremen
dous influence, his moral courage and his
fidelity In his search for the truth.

W. J. Tuska of San Francisco. S. N.
Reed of Kern and J. H. Liggett of Sac
ramento. Trask is apparently in the lead,
though it is possible the Grand Lodge
may pay its hosts of Salinas the compli
ment of electing Sargent to the coveted
prelacy. Grand Vice Chancellor William
T. Jeter of Santa Cruz and Grand Prelate
Leonard S. Calkins of Nevada City will
go up the ladder one step, it is confidently
stated, becoming respectively grand chan
cellor and grand .vice chancellor, but the
other grand officers are yet very doubt
ful, there being several candidates in the
lit-ld for each. The fight of the session
Â¦will center round the grand prelacy.
Important business was transacted in
the Grand Lodge this afternoon, standing
committees making reports and questions
of moment being under discussion. Among
the lattt-r was a proposition to establish
a Pythian Home at Woodbridge, Fresno
County. An offer from the board of trus
tees of old San Jacinto College of that
property accompanied the proposition and
much discussion took place before the
matter was finally referred to the com
mittee or. the Pythian home.
Telegrams from Stockton citizens in
viting the Grand Lodge to meet in that
city next year were received during the
afternoon. " Stockton Is making a big fight
for the next Grand Lodge and at present
seems likely to get It.
A petition from several prominent dele
gates for an appropriation to the bureau
of relief fund caused much interest thid
afternoon. The matter was finally re
ferred to the bureau of relief committee.
The Grand l^oilixe of Foresters of Amer
ica sent a telegram of greeting to the
Pythlans to-day and much enthusiasm
was occasioned when it was read to the
delegates. Thore was no session to-night,
the time being devoted to social and fra
ternal entertainments of various kinds
which were prepared by the townspeople
for the visitors.
The afternoon session of the Rathbone
Sisters consisted mainly of the conclusion
of yesterday's routine business, officers'
reports and committee appointments. An
early adjournment was taken. To-mor
row both sexes of Pythlans will devote
the morning to a visit to the Spreckels
sugar factory. The afternoon will be
taken up with business. The annual ban
quet occurs to-morrow night.

for the entertainment of the
Pythiar.s a?sÂ«Â»i;ibled in this city this
week, ar.d gayety and fraternal Jollity
reign supreme throughout the town. To
day may be said to have been the spec
tacular day of the celebration, for the
pran<5 parade took place this morning.
T!-e parade began at 10:2) o'clock, and the
column, headed by Troop C military band,
passed alor.g the main streets of the town
between lor.g lines of enthusiastic spec

of flowers at every point. The local or
ganizations in line were Troop C, N. G.

Bladder troubles most always result from
a derangement of the kidneys and a cure is
obtained quickest by a proper treatment of
the kidneys. If you are feeling badly you
can make no mistake by taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney, liver and
bladder remedy.
It corrects inability to hold urine and scald-
ing pain in passing- it, and overcomes that
unpleasant necessity of being compelled to
go often during the day. and to get up many
times during the night. The mild and tho
extraordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its won-
derful cures of the most distressing cases.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and sold

Committee Decides to Recommend Or
dinance Taxing Encroachments
on Streets and Sidewalks.
The Supervisors' Committee on License
and Orders decided yesterday to recom
mend for passage McCarthy's ordinance
imposing a license tax upon special privi
leges leading to encroachments upon the
sidewalks and streets. The ordinance
provides that any person, firm or corpor
ation owning any building or other struc
ture which occupies part of or obstructs
the sidewalks or streets or in any manner
prevents the free and uninterrupted use
of the public sidewalks or streets shall
pay a license tax of $4 per year; that on
sklewalk. elevator hatchways, for coal
chutes and similar openings in the side
walk $2 per year shall be the tax; for
steps leading from a building out and
upon the sidewalk $1 per year: for car
riage blocks S3 per year; for railroad sig
nal houses or other signaling devices $Z
per year; for light wells, air shafts In the
sidewalks $2 per foot per year; for news
paper bulletin board, theatrical billboard
or projecting slgrns $2 per foot per year;
for bootblack stands Jl per year:, for
clocks over or upon the sidewalk $4 per
year; for lamps over and upon the side
walk, if they are kept burning all night,
nothing.
The committee also recommended a li
cense of " $10 per quarter on baseball
games. It referred tho matter of licens
ing football games to the Judiciary Com
mittee to determine if the board can im
pose a license of $100 on the annual con
test between the universities.
The license on persons who sell mer
chandise from a stationary wagon or
stand on the public streets was tlxed at
$â¢> per quarter; a graduated license on
hotel keepers, restaurants or persons en
gaged as caterers of from $3 to $2o0 per
quarter, according to the business done,
was adopted.
The ordinance prohibiting any one from
engaging In the business of house moving
unless qualified to do so and imposing a
license of $f>0 per quarter thereon was
also favorably acted on.
LICENSE ON SPECIAL
PRIVILEGES FAVORED
It has come to the knowledge of Auditor
Wells that certain departments of the
city government are preparing to reduce
the estimated deficit in the city funds by
holding until July demands for bills con
tracted during the. present month and
June. It is then proposed to put a July
date on the demands. In order that they
may bo paid out of the funds appropriat
ed for tho next fiscal year. In this way
an artificial surplus similar to that here
tofore made by carrying over statutory
salaries of June will be created.
Auditor Wells says that if the intention
to carry over bills accruing during the
months of May and June is carried out it
will be a direct violation of a specific
charter provision and that he will per
emptorily refuse to sign any such de
mands of which he may obtain knowl
edge. The section referring to the sub
ject provides among other thln?s that any
demand upon the treasury accruing undor
the charter shall not bo paid, but shall
be forever barred by limitation of time
unless they be presented for payment,
properly audited, within one month after
the demands become due and payable, or
unless it is afterward found that the pres
entation of them at the proper times was
not in the power of the creditors.
"It is -plainly to be seen," said the Au
ditor, "that any bills accruing for goods
or supplies during the months of May and
June, 1900, must be charges against the
funds appropriated for the expenses of
this year only. I can easily see that the
illegal method might saddle claims of pos
sibly $100,000 on the funds appropriated for
the next fiscal year, which would be man
ifestly unfair and would -only result in
forming a nucleus for another deficit next
year."
Auditor Wells Declares the Plan Is
in Direct Violation of Charter
and He Will Firmly
Oppose It.
Depart ments Propose to
Carry Bills Over to Next
Fiscal Year.
ILLEGAL METHOD
OF MEETING THE
CITY'S DEFICIT
â¢jp=5sROMOTErtS of prizefights and
V^-J) pugriMsts alike. If a decision handed
JÂ£ <Vivv:i by Judge Murasky yesterday
i.Â« sustained by the Supremo Court,
must turn to other pursuits, or. if they
Â¦could Ntill ply their bruising vocation,
must search for f.elds of battle without
tho limits of California. Judge Murasky
has declared section 412 of the Penal Code
unconstitutional. It wa? on this section
that puRjIiPts pinne<l their hope to defeat
the ordinance imposing a license of $1000
a year on "domestic incorporated clubs"
and limiting: boxing exhibitions to one
*>ach month. Their with this object
:n view has proved a boomerang, how
ever, for with the fall of section 412 has
come the resurrection of the act of 1393,
which makes prizeftehting; a felony and
as punishment therefor Imposes a line of
from tl'JOO to 55000, or imprisonment for
not less than one year nor more than
throe.
This decision was reached in the action
of the Columbia Athletic Club to restrain
Chief of Police Sullivan from Interfering
vith a. proposed !!ght. the second in a
month. Judge Murasky refused the club
the relief prayed for, and now. until final
."luuiement Is handed down by the Supreme
â¢ "â¢>urt or the force and effect of the deci
sion is stayed by regular appr-al, pugilists
will place the brand of felony upon them
pelves by entering the arena to battle for
money, fame or prestige. Judge Muras
ky's opinion reads:
The plaintiff seeks to enjoin the defendant
from enforcing a.n ordinance of the Board of
Supervisors regulating sparring exhibition*,
upon the ground that the ordinance is in con-
J5i>~t with the statutes of the State upon the
FL-bject and in therefor* void. Section 412 of
the Fer.al Code permits the giving of sparring
t*x 1 1 â¢"Â¦us t> j* inoorj*orat t*<i rlubs u port th^ p^T-â
tfrrmance of certain conditions, such as the
tirenfcymerit of an annual license, to be fixed
by the Hoard of Supervisor* of the county in
which the exhibition is to take pla^e. the at
tendance of a. physician at the exhibition and
the using of jrlovep of a certain welcht.
I am of oj>jnk.n that the ordinance Is in
conflict with the statute; that It prohibits
what the statute permits and discriminates
where the statute <5'<es not. It is contended
by the defendant, however, that section V.I
of the Penal Co-le i 8 ltpelf voM. and that hÂ»
should nnt be restrained by reason of any of
its prm-isiors. The principle that laws must
be general in character and uniform In opera
tion will not be disputed. It Is the statutory
method of declaring the rule which is an es
eer.tlal of our Fvytem of government that no

class shall be privileged. The Legislature shall
n<t grant to any person or class of persons
priviiepef: which, upon the same terms and
under like circumstances, shall not equally be
long to all r-Tsons: nor shall it exempt from
the provisions of the penal law any person or
class of persons unless, under like circum
stances, the exemption applies to all other per
sons.
ThÂ° constitution of the State provides that
"the I>ecis!ature shall not pass local nor spe
cial laws â¢ â¢ â¢ for the punishment of crlm**8
and misdemeanors." "To similar facts under
like eiroumstanres, to persons similarly situ
ated, the law must apply uniformly."
A corporation has no greater privileges than
an individual In wpect to the privileges and
immunities conferred by the law or the acts
which it prohibits, where both corporation and
individual stand in the same relation to the
law and fire in the Fame category. In other
words, an .act that is mad* a crime is a crime
whether committed by an Individual or a cor
poration. Serjir.n 412 draws an insurmountable
distinction between two classes of persons in
the community and punishes one by Imprison
ment in the penitentiary for the commission
of an act which, when done by the other, is
purely Innocent. It provides that "a i^rson
wh'< within this Plate â¢ â¢ â¢ enrages In Â«
public or private sparrir.c exhibition â¢ â¢ â¢
shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction
shall be fined not less than one thousand dol
lars iv, r more than five thousand dollars and
be Imprisoned In the Â£tatÂ« prison not les-s than
cne year nor more than three years: provided,
however, that sparring exhibitions not to ex
<-eed a limited num>>er of rounds, with gloves
of net less than five ounces each In weight,
may be held by a domestic incorporated club"
upon the prepayment of a certain license ami
the performance of other conditions.
It will be ohserve.1 that the statute first
make? It a felony to h"ld a sparring exhibition
and then i>ermits the giving of such an ex
hibition by a domestic incorporated club which
shall comply with certain conditions. It pro
hibits such an exhibition from b?ing given by
an unincorporated club cr association or by

an individual. What, In the flr?t part of the
section. is denied to any "person" in the
t^tate. In the second part is granted to a cer
tain class of iÂ«rsons, namely, domestic in
corporated clubs. If an act be a felony when
done by an individual It must be a felony when
done by a cor]K>ration. The Legislature has
not the power to make a felon of one and a
law-abiding citizen of the other whore both
have committed the sime act. Such a pro
vision is clearly in contravention of article IV.
eectlon 2.-1. of the constitution. If It be a felony
for an unincorporated association to commit
a certain act tho mere incorporating of the.
association cannot make its act an innocent
one. %
The section grants privileges and provides
Immunities from punishment to one ilars of
persons which under the gime circumstances
it withholds from all other classes In the
community and Is therefore void.
It Is the rule that if one portion of a sec
tion may be iWlared unconstitutional and the
remainder constitutional the latter shall stand,
provided that the intent of the Legislature can
be retained. In the section under consideration
it is evident that the Legislature intended not
to prohibit sparring exhibitions entirely, but
to permit them under certain conditions, the
defect being that it does not extend the up-
portunlty of obeying conditions to all person?
Â¦wishing: to comply therewith. It will he Im
possible to retain fine portion of th<Â» section
and to strike out another without destroying
the Intent of the lawmaktng body, and under
the circumstances the entire act must be de
clared unconstitutional.
The Invalidity of section 412 restores to the
Ftntute books the act of JR93. which provides
that It shall be unlawful for any person or
persons within this State "to engage In what
is generally known as prizefighting, with or
without gloves, whereby bruising or mnlming
or other serious bodily Injury may result to
the participants." TWore plaintiff may seek
to enjoin the deferdant from Interfering with
it* e>hlbitlon It must show that It does not
purpose to give one In conflict with the act of
ISM. The motion to dissolve the temporary In
junction is granted.
While admitting- that Judpc- Murasky's
decision hap effectually ended the game
of 'Â¦pilzpflKhtins" within the borders of
this State, George I). Collins, who repre-
FPntfd, the plaintiff corporation, contends
that tho decision Is In fact a victory for
the local clubs; as It ends the power of
the Supervisors to interfere with "spar
ring contests," "whereby there is no dan
ger of bruising: or maimlnp." The police,
however, hol-1 a different view. They are
aware of the love of San Francisco's
sporting element for a fiRht anil so, keep
ing in mind the word "may," that quali
flf.s the bruising and maiming section,
they will advance into the arena of bat
tle and end any pugilistic game in which
blood "may" flow or bruise result.

LmiLUREj
Every day adds to the list of deaths
attributed to . heart failure. If the
truth were told- the bulk of these
deaths might be written down as due
to stomach failure. "For it is in the
failure of the stomach and other organs
of digestion and nutrition, that "weak"
heart, "weak " lungs, " weak " nerves and
other forms of physicial deterioration
having their beginning. The man whose
stomach is sound, who can digest and
assimilate the food he eats, and so keep
each organ of the body well nourished,
is the man who is least liable to collapse
under the sudden weakness of some
vital organ.
The preservation of health which ' fol-
lows the use of Dr. Pierce's Golden
Medical Discovery, is chiefly due to the
fact that it perfectly and permanently
cures diseases of the stomach and organs
of digestion . and nutrition, purifies the
blood and increases the blooa supply of
the body. Weak, people will find in this
medicine a sure means of strength.
"I was under doctors' care for quite a time,"
writes Mr. J. p. Kidd, of Parmleysville, Wayne
Co., Ky. "They had almost given me up, and
my suffering- was very great. My pulse was
weak, breatli short and I had severe pains in
back, head and legs. ' Had palpitation of heart,
and for eleven months I was not able to do a
day's wort. I purchased five bottles of Dr. R. V.
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery and by the
time the fifth bottle was gone I was a well man."

Seeks Divorca for Desertion.
OAKLAND. May 23.â Mrs. Elizabeth
Reed filed suit to-day for a divorce from
George Reed. She alleges desertion on
the part oX her husband. The couple were
married in 1SS9.
"When 1 took these women in some time
ago they didn't have a rag on their
backs," declared the irate Engleberg to
the policemen. "Now they have a fur
nished house and eat tenderloin steaks
three times a day. M<! â well. I won't tell
you what I eat. but no tenderloin steaks
are cooked in my frying pan, and I am
supposed to be the main guy of the con
cern, too."
When Engleberg was informed of th*
decision of the police he extinguished the
lights and everybody was forced into the
street temporarily.
Monday night George Engleberg, who
has possession of the charter announcing
that the United Christian church exists
in a manner pleasing to law. called Po
licemen John Davids and Ben Kaskell and
requested that the women be driven from
the place. Mrs. Brown and her daughter
protested against any such proceeding
on the grounds that they were duly ini
tiated members of the church and had as
much right on the premises as any one
else. The policemen reported the matter
to the California-street station, and aftei
due deliberation decided that they could
take no part in the quarrel.
The trouble appears to have resulted
from charges against a Mrs. Brown and
her daugnter, who are employed in in
stilling Christianity into the little sons of
Confucius and Instructing them how to
substitute the English alphabet for the
old Chinese chlrography. Both ladles are
accused of the crime of residing in a
comfortably furnished house and of eat
ing tenderloin steaks. The spirit of jeal
ousy aroused by this report culminated
in a movement to dismiss the high livers
from the schoolroom.
War broke out among the United Chris
tians at 22 Waverley place Monday even
ing, and the assistance of the police was
required to restore order. According to
all parties concerned no armistice has
been declared and the strife has really
just begun. The head of the "Christians,"
instead of conducting a campaign against
sin and the devil, will carry on a crusade
for the ejectment of two women.

AUNT OF MAFEKING
HERO RESIDES HERE
Suspicion of Mayor Phelan's tax-eating
city government loomed up conspicuously
at the meeting of the Supervisors yester
day afternoon. The board met to take
pervisors That They Shall Be
Given Hearing.
Improvement Clubs Promised by Su-
DEMAND A SQUARE BUDGET.
THE usual serenity of the annual
meeting of the Merchants' Associa
tion, at Academy of Sciences Hall
last night, was disturbed by the ap
pearance of a committee from the Mis
sion Federation Clubs, with a request
amounting almost to a demand, that the
association do something to force the
Phelan administration to keep its pledge
for an economical city government. A.
S. Lillie headed the committee, and was
ably supported by Gustav Schnee and
George Center who made forcible
speeches against the reckless extrava
gance of the Phelan government.
"When our clubs were asked by this
association to support Phelan and the
new charter," said Lillie, "we were prom
ised, lirst a.nd foremost, an economical
government. We have derived some bene
iits from the charter, such as the merit
system in selecting municipal employes
and home rule, but we fail to tind any
economy in the new administration.- In
fact, it is the most costly that we have
ever had. Under the old system we al
ways came out with a balance on the
credit side of our ledger, but now only
a deticit stares us in the face. A month
ago our organization sent a communica
tion to your association asking for an in
vestigation into the flagrant extravagance
now being practiced at the City Hall. We
would like to know what has been done
in the matter. We need public improve
ments, and were promised them under
this administration, but how can we get
them out of a deficit?"
Chairman Frank J. Symmes assured the
committee that the association would
take the matter up, and at all tlmea act
in good faith.
Director Hugo Rothschild explained
that the association had been asked last
year by Mayor Phelan to figure on the
tax levy, and that a committee of fifty
five members had spent much time in ar
ranging one. When it was presented no
attention was paid to It by the Supervis
ors. This year no such request had been
received, and the association did not feel
that it could afford the time to again de
vote attention to it.
N. B. Greensfelder moved that the chair
appoint a committee to confer with the
Supervisors' Finance Committee on the
budget now in preparation. A. M. Davis
suggested that it would be the proper
thing for the members of the Mission
Federation to try their hand at preparing
a tax levy, embodying their views.
George Center said it would take too
much time.
After some discussion the Mission com
mittee agreed to appoint a committee to
examine the budget and make a report on
it to the association, the latter body then
to act. A motion embodying this idea
was substituted for that of Mr. Greens
felder and passed by the association.
President Dohrmann and Vice President
Baldwin being out of town. Treasurei
Frank J. Symmes was voted into the
chair when the association met last night.
Secretary J. Richard Freud read the an
nual report of the directors, which show
ed what the association had accomplished
during the past twelve months and what
it had in contemplation.
The following board of directors for the
ensuing term, regularly nominated by the
nominating committee, was elected:
A. S. Baldwin. C. S. Benedict, Charles Bund
schu. Foster P. Cole, Andrew M. Davis. F.
W, Dohrmann. Joseph D. Grant, Marshal Hale,
Huso D. Keil. A. J. McNIcoll. Edward H.

Ituio Rothschild, Frank J. Symmes.
A resolution was adopted* asking the
Board of Public Works to proceed with
the sprinkling of the principal streets of
the city, commencing at the beginning of
the new fiscal year, and that the Board
of Supervisors make sufficient appropria
tion in the tax levy to perform the *rork.
Percy Beamish offered a resolution,
which was passed, requesting the heads
of each department in the classified civil
service of the city government to com
ply with the organic law of San Francisco
and to faithfully observe the municipal
platforms upon which they were elected,
pledging them explicitly to carry out in
both letter and spirit the civil service pro
visions of the charter.
Secretary Freud read an interesting
paper on the "Merit System," and Civil
Service Commissioner P. H. McCarthy,
upon the Invitation of the chair, spoke on
the same subject.
steps preliminary to the preparation of a
municipal budget for the coming fiscal
year, and the estimates prepared by the
Auditor were before it.
George L.. Center, representing the Fed
eration of Mission Improvement Clubs,
addressed the board and said that the
meeting then in progresa was not such a3
the charter contemplated. There was no
budget before the Supervisors, he said,
only the Auditor's figures. Nothing coula
be done in the way of making suggestions
for the amendment of the budget until
i after the Finance Committee should have
Its report completed, for there would be
no budget to consider until that time, Mr.
Center contended. The Auditor's figures
might not be accepted by the Finance
Committee, he said. In mat case what
might be said at the meeting in progress
I would not be applicable to tne budget as
i prepared for final consideration.
Mayor Phelan said that if the taxpayers
had any objections to submit they might
be incorporated in the report of the
Finance Committee.
Mr. Center was still not satisfied that
the proper time for the hearing of the
taxpayers had arrived.
Supervisor Tobin interposed the sugges
tion that the Finance Committee would
welcome the assistance of the taxpayers
and that there would be other meetings.
Upon this assurance Mr. Center withdrew
his objection.
C F. Klmball. representing the Nuevo
Potrero Improvement Club, protested
against the proceedings. Before he had
gone far the Mayor interrupted him sev
eral times, but Kimball persisted in being
heard. He finally tiled a formal protest.
Mayor Phelan tried to pin Klmball down
to a statement of just what those he rep
resented would wish. Kimball said that
he did not know what was relevant until
he had seen the budget.
"Where is this budget that we were in
vited here to discuss?" he asked. "We
do not see one."
Different improvement club representa
tives asked for many Improvements. Gus
tav Schnee said his club wanted a bridge
on McGill street over the railroad track,
to cost I16,0<Â»; a culvert under the railroad
tracks on Diamond street, to cost $2500;
srhoolhouses in the Sunnyslde, Mission,
Five Mile and Bergerot districts, to cost
$167,50(1: fire-engine house in Eureka Val
ley, schoolhouse in Eureka Vall^v, fire,
engine house in the New Potrero district,
iire-engine house in the Sunnyslde dis
trict.
George R. Fletcher asked that $5000
might be provided for the sidewalking and
paving with basalt of the south side of
Fulton street from Stanyan to the en
trance to the park near First avenue; and
that twenty electric lamps be given to the
Richmond district.
J. H. Bloom wished provision made for
the extension of the sewer on Potrero av.
enue along Twenty-fifth street to Army,
at a cost of $5000, and Charles YV. Pope
asked that the appropriation of $30,000 for
the improvement of Trocadero Gulch be
restored to the budget.
W. E. Dubois asked for $20,000 for pre
liminary work on the Market-street grade
and for $3000 for other work in his section.
J. J. Lynch urged the repaving of Fourth
street between Howard and Bryant. Ed
gar Painter of the North Central Im
provement Club asked for the repaving
of the business streets in the wholesale
section, estimating the cost at about
$100,000. D. Kelly requested the repaving
of three blocks on Valencia street be
tween Nineteenth and Twenty-second, at
a cost of about $2500 per block.
The board will consider the budget
again next Monday.

rest lightly upon her. She is almost an
American now. for six American boys and
girls call her "mother."
THE occurrences of yesterday augur badly for the taxeaters
of the Phelanized municipal government. In the afternoon,
when an intention was suspected on the part of the taxeat
ers to trick the taxpayers out of a chance to criticize the budget
after it has been prepared for submission by the Finance Com
mittee to the Supervisors, and especially to shut out ths investiga
tions of the members of the improvement clubs, who have been
sharply inquiring into the wild extravagance at the City Sail,
two members of the clubs protested. . They would not be satisfied
until they received assurance that they should have ample oppor
tunity to subject the proposed budget, at the proper time, to the
closest scrutiny and criticism. Last evening the matter of official
extravagance was brought up at the annual meeting of the Mer
chants' Association in the Academy of Sciences Hall. Reckless
ness in the expenditure of municipal funds by the payment of
salaries to needless and superfluous officials was a leading theme
for discussion.

When General Roberts gets back to England he
will be saved from one temptation which was too
much for Dcwcyâ he cannot be enticed to run for
President
Another band of Filipino insurgents has ambushed
a body of American trcops. It begins to look as if
that report sent out by the censor? that the glorious
war v.-as over was a trifle immature.
!Cow thst certain parties have been indicted for per
jury in the Fair will ccsc it is to be hoped the prose
cutions will be thorough and reach al! the parties con
recied with the guilt. Perjury is enc of the crimes
that ought to be very unhealthy in California.
In ? recent iecture a local theosophist deplored the
fact thr.t some people positively decline to cherish
memories of their past life. If that, lecturer knew
something more of the lives of some of our public
r:en ht would find congratulation, not yadness, in
Christian ; scientists at Topeka have sent another
enthusiastic devotee to an early death; Christian
science must cam* with it the inevitable association
of an early 5 death.
The opposition to the renomination of Bryan, has
ceased even in New York, and the party is now get
ting ready for the national convention with air the
quietness of a funeral procession.
The "Democrats" in Havana have. gone into the
sulks on the very verge of a political campaign. They
might learn wisdom from their American prototype,
sulk as much as they .please, but vote as often as
safety will permit.
Ignatius Donnelly has said that if the Lord had
taken an inch off Bryan's jawbone and placed it be
tween his temples he might have been President of
the United States, so it is clear the old fellow doesn't
always talk in cryptograms.
According to the London Chronicle the number of
"war books" made up for the occasion has 'outrun
the demand. One publisher is said to' have been of
fered twenty-five of them in a single week. The mar
ket is glutted with that sort of stuff, and the hack
writers will have to go to hacking at something else.
Orchardists in the neighborhood of Haywards are
complaining that unless white workingmen become
more numerous they will be forced to employ Japan-,
ese chattels. This ought to be the strongest sort of
a hint to white men who want work. The little
brown men are flooding the State with an unwelcome
presence. :-â¢-
The authorities at San Qucntin have made the in
teresting discovery that "dope," wrapped in news
papers, has been smuggled in to prisoners. It is bet
ter than an even wager that the journals were of the
yellow variety and the convicts will probably insist
that the officers should not believe all they find in the
newspapers.
Prominent and representative leaders in local im
provement clubs have come to the conclusion that
the only "work" performed by the Board of Public
Works is in drawing outrageously extravagant sala
ries. But critics should remember what a halo' of
distinction the board throws around the administra
tion of his Honor, the Mayor. That ought to be work
enough for anybody.

The attempt of the Bryanites to make politics out
of their presence is disgusting to every man of sense.
The Boer delegates have presented no diplomatfc
rrcdcntin'f. either at the White House or the State
Department. They have been received and treated
with courtesy, and being men of sense they know that
this Government can do no more for them than it has.
Their real mission here is in win the sympathy of the
jienple into* further help for their sufferers by the
war. This they wiil get and should in abounding
measure.
The Examiner's declaration that "the administra
tion has taken pleasure in snubbing the representa
tives of a brave people in the sight of the world" is
a lie. brazenly told in the hope that it may catch a
few rotes in favor of degrading our national credit
and injuring the swelling industries of the people.
It iÂ« not probable that they asked anybody to be
received on the floor of the Senate. It is not a usual
proceeding for Embassadors to be so received. If
each privilege be extended to them because they are
at war with Great Briiain, what reason could the Ex
r.miner give for r.ot extending it also to Sir Julian
r.ir.r.refr,te. the Embassador of Great Britain? And
then what a Bryan howl would go up!
They have our sympathy, and the money of our
people has been poured o;:t to them. If we were
at-]war with England in 1903 as Franc; was in 1777
they would have more. They would have our alliance
Slid our army and navy would strike England
through then. But we are not at war with Eng
land and have no reason to be. Therefore the Gov
ernment of the Unite! States cannot go a jot beyond
the tender of good offices which it has already made.
This the Boer Embasfadors know, and all the world
knows, except perhaps the Examiner, j which knows
nothing straight.
True it wss not thus, nor are other things thus,
eitlicr. France was thr enemy of England in 1776.
smarting tinder the loss to England of her domain
north of the Ohio River in 176.2, and impelled by
enmity and state policy to join us in a war against
England that would strip her of her American pos
sej'ion*. as she had stripped France. She received
our envoys and she joined her Innd and naval forces
to or.rs. and continued her warfare upon England as
our ally. Had Â»he owed England no grudge and been
at peace with her the cold shoulder our envoys would
have found in Paris would refrigerate unto this day.
That is history, and no one but a fool, who thinks
the people are fools, wili use the event as an analogue
to the ca?e of the- Boer?.
The Examiner is i-ufferi:ig all the contortions of
confirmed rickets because the Boer Embassadors
were not voted on to the floor of the United States
Senate. It remarks in sorrow and in anger that '.'it
xvaÂ« r.ot thu> tha: our envoys were received at the
court of France in the evil dayj of 1776 and 1777."
THE BOER DELEGATES.
THE sympathy of the American people is with
the Dmch republics. That oliicial sympathy at
Washington is the same there is no . doubt.
That the Bryanites are toiling to make domestic poli
tics out of it all is also clear.
I do not believe that there Is a single
instance where a thought is entertained
of avenging wrongs said by some irre
sponsible person to be felt because of the
action I took in performing my duty.
That duty is well known by every soldier
to have been earnestly demanded from
Alcatraz to such an extent as to make the
task of guarding military convicts very
difficult and undesirable. As I was pres
ent myself, all responsibility involved on
me, but I give the greatest credit to the
sentries who were with me for the excel
lent work which they executed on incon
ceivably short notice.
I am sure that this affair has the ap
proval of all who do guard at the Pre
sidio, and iill of whom, should they fail
under similar circumstances to render
proper service, would be threatened im
mediately with a general court-martial.
I trust that this may receive your con
sideration and be inserted at the earliest
opportunity, as it will be sanctioned by
all soldiers and thus will justly defeat the
theory of "boycotting" so erroneously
published. Yours respectfully,

f* CHARMIXG Hi.le woman, clever
#1 and observant, and gifted with
[\ much personal magnetism, is Mrs.
I Abraham Fischer, wife of one of
" the delegates from the Orange Free
State. While the delegates have
busted themselves with conferences from
early morning until midnight Mrs. Fisch
er has been quite as busily engaged with
new-found friends. She has been enter
tained at teas and luncheons and Is on
joying her first experience In a far-off
country, while she. as well as her hus
band and his associates, find warm sym
pathy for their cause. The Boer peace
delegates are making preparations to visit
some of the most important cities of this
country. â¢
Mrs. Fischer, who Is a Scotch woman,
recently chatted with a newspaper man
about life in the Orange Free State dur
ing th'e war. She said first that many
stories sent out . from English sources
were wholly false.
"It was outrageous that report which
was sent out a while ago that women
were being enlisted into the Boer army,
or would be. They would go willingly,
but their services would not be accepted.
The Boers are not barbarians to send
women into war. If some few have been
found it Is because they were disguised
as men, and thus entered the ranks.
"It would be easier for them if they
might nght. As it is. they stay home try
ing to keep the great farms running that
the country may not be devastated, and
it is heartbreaking work. Our farms
cover large tracts of country, and the
work is done by the natives, negroes, of
whom there are always many, and they
are difficult to manage. .
"They are lazy and shiftless and need
the management of a man to keep them
going; but there is many a plucky Boer
woman quite alone in her home looking
after a force which before the war took
all the time of her husband and sons.
Mrs. Fischer, Wife
of the Peace Com
missioner, Tells of
Life in the Trans
vaal
of the American Government: If we could
only do that our cause would be won. ror
all Europe would follow Americas ex
ample.
"We do not want America to fightâ that
Is not necessary. A mere declaration of
sympathy would be sufficient to throw
the balance of favor our way. Europe la
afraid to bo the first, but America Is a
powerful ally, whose support would bring
others. We want the help of the Ameri
can women to bring that about, we
women of other countries hear that those
here are powerful. If ever their help was
needed It la now. and we South African
women are putting our faith In them.
"We find here such sympathy from Indi
viduals that it makes us very happy. Tba
weeks before our coming here havÂ« Been
so hard and trying that we are appreciat
ive of Joy."
Mr. and Mrs. Fischer left their home Â»t
Bloenrfontein ten days before the arrival
of General Roberta.
Mrs. Fischer said further: "We put our
things Into warehouses Quite in method
ical fashion, but it was terribly hard and
depressing to handle the things which
had made my home for nearly thirty
years and not know when, if ever. I
should have them ajraln. I have two sons
(one of them is commando now in the Boer
army), and there were things they had
used and played with all their lives, to be
sent away.
Many a woman In Bloemfontein went
through the same thing in those days, but
we tried very bard to be hopeful and
trust in the time when we should com*
back. We did not believe that the British
would wantonly injure our houses, but
we do not like now to think of the
changes which must always be, mads la
war.
One of Mrs. Fischer's sons Is fighting
with the Boer army; the other is at Cam
bridge. England, studying law. Mrs,
Fischer said that the boy in England was
treated with great consideration by his
fellow-students, although he was anxious
to return home to fight.â Exchange.
MY BRAVE SEX IS DEVOTED TO THE BOER CAUSE,
Our African War Is

Part.
And can you. Dr. Kinyoun. perform any greater
service than the annihilation of a menagerie at your
Federal quarantine station? The Call declares that
you cannot prove that a single case of bubonic plague
exists in this city, and in justice to San Francisco and
to the State you and your associates should frankly
admit the fact. . ; '
Can you, Dr. V. P. Buckley, aid your official fel
lows and prove what they cannot do? Can you do
more than institute begus. burlesque quarantines and
give circulation to baseless and injurious rumors?
The Call defies }-ou to do so.
Dr. R. W. Bauni, can you prove from personal
investigation or competent scientific testimony
that San Francisco is afflicted with a solitary instance
of the plague? The Call defies you to do so. and
will publish your proofs if you have any.
Will you, Dr. W. D. McCarthy, do more than your
associates on the board and prove that this city har
bors a case of the plague? You cannot do so, and
your duty to the people of San Francisco demands
that you strive to remedy the grave evil you have
inflicted by your official action.
Can you, Dr. Louis Bazet, risk your professional
standing in an attempt to prove that a single case of
the dread disease is in San Francisco? If you can The
Call will publish every detail of any proof you may
submit. As a physician; having the health of many
people in your keeping, do you countenance calmly
the fact that their servants frequent the supposed in
fected district and may carry the disease to many
homes? Do you believe that your assertion of a
danger is compatible with your lethargy and in
efficiency to protect against it?
Are you. Dr. J. M. Williamson, a physician of re
pute, ready to prove by scientific investigation that
there is a single case of bubonic plague in San Fran
cisco? If you are The Call will publish every fact
you prove. Are you ready to injure this city almost
itreparablj by insisting upon a course of sensational
r.ction* which is absolutely unwarranted? Believing
that the plague exists here, have you any justifica
tion as a physician and a public officer for the far
cical quarantine which you have established on
paper? If you think that the people of the city are in
jeopardy, do you consider it just to subject them
without bar or hindrance to the supposed infected
district? Common jrstice demands your answers in
the proof of a single case of the plague in this city.
The members of the Board of Health of San Fran
cisco are therefore rightly upon trial before the peo
ple of the city and of the State. They are called upon
to justify their proceedings with a proof of what they
charge. They are in duty bound to answer the ques
tions which intelligence asks of them.
The facts in this case are beyond controversy. The
physician who attended the Chinese has given his cer
tificate that the disease was intermittent fever. The
Chinese has been interviewed by a representative of
The Call, and the whole sensational, scandalous fabric
of the Board of Health has crumbled after an inves
tigation. Upon this incident alone the Health Board
has reared its plague phantom. With craft rather than
stupidity the board has called in the Federal quaran
tine officers with a hope of shirking responsibility for
unwarranted acts and diverting the censure which
these local officials knew they deserved. The Fed
eral officers could not act until the local authorities
took official action, and that official action was to
declare that a Chinese suffering from intermittent
fever is a victim of bubonic plague.
This paper will not publish theories and opinions
or suspicions and feats of something which so se
riously injure the city. This paper will not give cur
rency to the deadly child's play of officials who have
no realization of their solemn obligations. This paper
will not publish the facts of a burlesque quarantine
which did nothing except to affright the people of
San Francisco and then to amuse them. The news
papers in the" interior of the State should know that
the existing shameful condition of affairs was brought
about by the charge of the Board of Health that a
Chinese, How Quan, living at 721 Clay street and
suffering from intermittent fever, was a victim of the
bubonic plague. The man is now recovered from his
simple ailment and has resumed his ordinary occupa
tion.
The newspapers in the interior of the State, blind
to the vital interests of the localities they are supposed
to represent, are taking up the cry which the tongue
of rumor has raised. Absolutely without information
and without a single demonstrated fact, these news
papers are accusing the press of San Francisco of
suppressing the truth. The press of San Francisco
has suppressed no'thing except the extravagant opera
tions of an incompetent Phelanizcd Board of Health
which, without judgment, with no proofs and no
thought of the direful consequences, plunged to the
assertion of a fact which The Call now defies the
board to prove. When the Board of Health proves
that a single case of bubonic plague exists in San
Francisco The Call will publish the fact with every
incidental detail that is necessary.
The members of the Board of Health are certainly
conscious of their tremendous responsibility. They
know that by their melodramatic operations and the
circulation of their idle rumors they have ex
cited the fears of the people of San Francisco, have
made the city a mark of dread to other cities, have
injured our commerce, have struck a blow at the in
dustries of the entire State, which cannot be reme
died in a year, and have placed upon us a burden of
explanation heavier perhaps than any which the city
ever had to bear. In justice to themselves, then, the
members of the Board of Health must submit a proof
of a single case of plague in this city or admit a
lamentable error and strive to correct the evil which
unfounded rumor, baseless 'exaggeration and unwar
ranted assertions are making more serious every day.
THE time has come for the Board of Health of
San Francisco to justify with proof the im
measurable evil it has worked upon this city by
asserting the existence of bubonic plague in our midst,
or frankly and honestly seek, 50 far as it may by a con
fession of error based on suspicion, to undo the grave
mischief which has been done not alone to San Fran
cisco but to the entire State. The bubonic plague
does not exist in San Francisco, and The Call defies
the members of the Board of Health to prove a sin
gle authentic c:iÂ«.c in the city. This defiance is made
with a thorough knowledge of the situation, after
a complete and expert investigation of the whole de
plorable affair. From the moment the Board of
Health made its baseless assertions and pursued its
headlong, heedless and reckless policy, which has now 1
worked untold harm, The Call has made diligent and
competent inquiry of every phase of the scare, and to
day it demands from the Board of Health, as respon
sible and honest officials of San Francisco.-to prove
tlie presence of a single case of the plague in this- city.
SUBMIT PROOFS OR RETRACT.
The Call has not laid aside the harness in which it
maintained a long battle for decency in the selection
of a Senator. Success in that distinguished and pro
longed action put strength in the loins of the party.
We do not believe there is a true Republican in the
State who does not feel that the party escaped sui
cide in the Senatorial election. Then why should it
now be permitted to decline from the high plane on
which it stands and imperil its future by seeking in
spiration from the growler and refreshing itself for a
great fight on heel taps?
The Republicans of the State have just seen the
effect of permitting them to control a State conven
tion. True it had but one duty to perform, in the
selection of a delegation to ratify a Presidential nomi
nation already made by the people. But what harm
their primary could do is done, and the Republican
party outside San Francisco still feels the pinch and
is ruefully rubbing the mark that is left. The people
are not to be fooled. They cannot be driven nor
coaxed into an unwilling fellowship with the low and
bleary leadership that has recently left its slobber on
the garments of California Republicanism. Those
who keenly appreciate the- need of continued Repub
lican supremacy and who wince under the known ef
fects of a change are apt, however, to shut their eyes
to such consequences and use their ballots to punish
the party if it seem incapable of "taking its manage
ment out of hands that leave uncleanncss upon every
thing they touch. It is a grave error to suppose that
they must be counted as a means to party success
Their influence goes not an inch beyond the half
criminal intrigues by which they get the influence to
control results in their interest. *
Decent men, by banding together, can emancipate
decency from going hat in hand to these bosses to
beg for a chance to participate in public affairs. De
cent .men are vastly in the majority in the Republican
party,, and that majority should control it. We beg
of the Republicans of this city to consider these
things. If they take pride in the principles of their
party, and believe their success to be vital, they must
begin now to make such success sure. There is only
one way to do this. Let lists of decent men be mads
for decent men to vote for as delegates at the pri
mary, and then support them to victory.
These bosses are wise in their way. When de
cency is embattled and in its strength refuses to give
them quarter, they offer no fight. They keenly scent
trouble in an awakened sentiment which refuses to
submit to them, and go into seclusion in the shadow
of their rum barrels and wait until the public con
science again becomes apathetic before exchanging
the corkscrew and cards for the baton and badge of
party dictators.
In perfect frankness we are able to declare that less
blame will attach to the offensive and disgusting
bosses than to those who let them have their way
when their overthrow is easy. They appear only
when and where an opportunity occurs by the re
fusal of members of the party to take the trouble to
cherish its good name.
The primary law extends to every citizen protection
in his right to vote his choice at this first process in
the line of party action. If the character of the Re
publican party suffer in the result, the fault will be
with the decent citizens who will not take the time to
discharge the simple duty of voting for decent dele
gates. The vile and offensive bosses are always alert
to take advantage of. the indifference of decency to
poiitical results. .If the party in this city shall appear
to be led by two of the lowest bosses .vho have ever
appeared in its politics, the fault will be with those/'
who could have prevented it, but did not. When the
party is reproached for being in the hands of two
men of vicious life, with its plans discussed and or
dered from gin mills and the stews of the tenderloin,
the indifference which permitted the reproach to be
true will rise to the level of a crime against good
government. -.:'..
The necessity for discharging their political duty
will therefore be apparent to all citizens who appre
ciate the need of Republican success and desire to
avert/the consequences of such a change as the suc
cess of Bryanism implies.'
REPUBLICAN primaries will be held to elect
delegations to general conventions in which the
State Committee to manage the approaching
campaign will be chosen and candidates for Congress
will be nominated. These primaries affect the party
choice for nominees to fill the legislative offices, and
their result will determine the whole character and as
pect in which the Republican party of California will
be. presented, to the people in this very important
year. v

Captain "Newt" Jordan, the pilot, had
a narrow escape last Tuesday, lie was
to take the collier Wellington to sea and
was on his way to the front on a Sutter
street car. Near the ferries he -jumped
off without noticing: a McAllister-street
car coming up behind. The latter struck
Jordan, knocking him fully ten feet. The
car was stopped, but not before the fen
der was within an inch of the pilot's
head. Captain Jordan took the Welling
ton to sea, but when he got home had to
go to bed. Yesterday he could not move
himself, and It will be several days before
he can be about again.
Chief of Police Sullivan paid an official
visit to the water front yesterday. He
expressed himself as highly satisfied with
Captain Dunlevy's management of things
around the bay.
The French bark Normandle, which left

To Byron the ruins of his own life were
quite as much a matter for concern aa the
ruins of the Eternal City, and so great Is
the power of his expres.=Â»ion that aa we
read we share his conviction.
And the strength of Byron expresses It
self in the simplest passions and with the
greatest simplicity and directness of ut
terance. There is nothing ideal or super
subtle In the work of this great earth
born Titan; nothing of the peculiar
"heightening effect of style" In his verse.
All the more on this account do his out
bursts seem to come from and speak to
the heart. The cry of Manfred,
Astarte! my beloved, epeak to me!

inspiration for one of Shelley's noblest
odes,

Streams like a thunderstorm against the wind,
the summons to Greece to rise for lib
erty and the call to his own heart to
shake off its unworthy shackles and seek
an honorable endâ all these move us
with the grand force of an utterance of
nature.
Since his death Byron's fame has been
greater upon the Continent than In Eng
land. This Is partly because his excel
lencies are universal, and his defects in
diction and meter such as only a native
would detect. -But there is a more potent
causo than this. Byron is identified with
the cause of revolution and the struggle
for national liberty. At the darkest hour
of the cause he flung his splendid person
ality Into the scales, and it was worth an
army of lesser men. He was deep in the
councils of the revolutionists in Italy; he
gave ,hls life for the liberation of Greece.
The poets of revolution for fifty years to
come â Leopardl. Heine. Pushkin, Hugo â
looked up to htm as their master. Byron
is in no sense one of the peculiar glories
of English literature; he 13 in a very real
sense one of the makers of the modern
world.

Just as Thorwaldsen's famous Lucerne
lion Is cut In the side of a rocky cliff and
is surrounded by a grotto of natural rock,
out of which it seems to have sprung be
fore the mighty javelin laid it low In
death, so Wordsworth must ever be as
sociated with the environment of his na
tive lakes anJ hills. They are his natural
' background. They supply the form, color
and sound, as it were, to his verse; in
deed, they Interpret In the Infinite variety
of their manifestations the workings of a
heart and mln<i In perfect harmony with
them. Every poem written, every story
told has its proper backgroundâ the set
tins is ns eattntial to the thought as the
scene to the dramatic action â but to every
mood and thought of Wordsworth, In truth
to his vsry life, the lake district seems to
be essential. But never for a moment
must It be fancied that Wordsworth used
his surroundings as Scott Impressed the
scenery of the neighboring country into
his service, nor as Byron selected the
choice places of the world for his dra
matic situations.
If you wish to test this statement, try
to reconstruct the landscape after a de
scriptive passage from Wordsworth. He
never describes for mere description. It
would be counted strange if nature could
be caught grouping Itself for picturesque
effect, and such is the naturalness of
W r ordsworth's workmanship that -the
poet can never be said to have arranged
There was a very heated discussion In
the boardroom of the Harbor Commission
ers yesterday, and at one time it looked
as though two of the disputants would
come to blows. The He was passed, but
luckily the big table at which the Com
missioners were seated was between the
disputants, po the matter ended there.
The principals in the controversy were
Darby Laynon and P. F. Dundon, con
tractors: Howard C. Holmes, chief en
gineer of the Harbor Commission, and E.
M. Herrlck, president of the Pacific fine
Lumber Company. The subject under dis
cussion was the quality of "the piles fur
nished the board for repair work on the
front.
It appears that Darby Lnydon has the
contract for supplying 32 piles for repair
work at thÂ« Main-street wharf. The speci
fications called for "Oregon yellow fir
pine." and Laydon offered an article
which Chief pnglneer Holmes refused to
accept. The contractor tried to prove
that his article was as good, if not better,
than the pine called for in the specifica
tions, but Holmes, who seems to be
watching maters with an eagle eye since
he was called down so liard by the board
in connection with the irregularities in
the matter of fonftructing the Howard
street dock, could not see it that way. He
said I,aydon's piles were "white pine. 1 '
while Mr. Herrick designated them as
"bastard pine." At this point Dundon
remarked that when the bids for the work
on Main street were about to be opened
he had asked the board to define what
was meant by "Oregon yellow fir pine*."
and Holmes told him the "white pine"
would not be accepted.
Dundon had the words hardly out of his
mouth when Laydon jumped to his feet
and said. "If Mr. Dundon says hÂ© made
any such a statement to the board or
asked any such question he lies and he
knows it.
"Call me a liar!" exclaimed Dundon,
and he started across the room, but-was
stopped by Percy Henderson, the chief
wharfinger. Dundon then compromised
by calling upon Holmes to verify his
statement, and the latter said that some
such question had been asked, and that
he told Dundon in reply that he was look
ing after that part of the business. The
incident stopped there. .
After the discussion was over the board
deckled that the piles offered by Darby
Laydon were not up to the specifications
and that he would have to supply the
yellow pine pile for the work on Main
street wharf.

dredge the creek, as the place has shoaled
up to such an extent that only vessels of
a very light draught can now pet up be
yond the drawbridge. Commissioner Her
old said that Captain Charles Nelson
wanted to be heard on the proposition,
so the matter was laid over. In the
meantime Chief Engineer Holmes will
look into the matter and make a report.
Dr. Kinyouii. United States quarantine
officer, was given room in the new ferry

J. C. Wilson & Co. asked that a spur

with the belt railroad, while the San
Francisco Coke and Gas Company asked
that a connection be made between its
ulnnt at the foot of Mason street and the
belt railroad. Both matters were re*
ferred to the chief engineer.
The Alaska Commercial Company asked
that Union-street wharf when it is rebuilt
and covered should bo assigned to them.

mORE than S000 people participated
j-esterday in the seventh annual
picnic of the Butchers' Board of
Trade at Shell Mound. The
weather was fine and the attractions nu
merous. There were attractions for young
and old â dancing, games, horse races, mu
sic and side shows innumerable. No acci
dent occurred to mar the pleasure of the
day. The immense crowd was easily han
dled by the committee of arrangements,
of which Fred Becker of Oakland was
chairman. Nearly all of the butcher-shop3
in this city and around the bayâ wholesale
and retailâ were closed during the day,
and employers joined their employes in
the outing.
The center of attraction was the
racetrack at Emeryville, where a good
programme of trotting, pacing and run
ning races occupied the afternoon. Over
5000 people passed in at the gate. Two
bookmakers gave the sports an opportu
nity to back their opinions with coin and
a surprisingly large amount of. money
passed through their hands. Edward J.
Taaffe was at the head of the committee
in charge. The betting In the running
races was especially lively. In the flrst
the favorite. El Mido, owned by J. S.
Campbell, won at 3 to 5 in 1:44U, with F.
S. Kapp's Rapido second and M. Quinn's
Melcarth third. Dr. Rexford's Pongo
was the only other starter, Roadrunner,
Coda and Colonel Root being scratched.
Rapido won the second race, however, at
2 to 1, with Colonel Root a close second
and E. Carey's Miltouche in third place.
Time. 1:45. P. S. Smythe's Little Sister
was a strong favorite, being backed down
from 4 to 5 to 3 to u. She bled on the back
stretch, however, and was pulled up, fall
ing to finish at ail. Pongo again ran last
In the bunch. March Seven, Homestake,
Mrs. C. Twinkle Twlnk. Alturas, El Arte.
Skirmish. lx>mo and Aborigine contested
the third running event and Skirmish,
owned by H. S. Hobart. captured flrst
money, with Alturas a close second and
Lomo third. Time, 1:44. Hermia, owned
by Monroe Schweitzer, won the flrst heat
and money of the butchers' trotting and
pacing race, with S. Kafka's Plunkett
second and B. E. Combs' Anita III, the
other performers being A. P. Clayburgh's
Lazy Charlie and R. Consent's Zip. Time.
2:26^. Anita took the second heat in the
same time and Plunkett got third money.
The rlrst heat of the free for all trot was
Â¦won by I). Gannon's Twilight, with I-.
Richardson's Altevllo second and G.
Tassi'a Fled last. Search and Herald were
scratched. The time was 2:IS. Altevilo
took tiie second heat in 2:26?;.
The free-for-all pace was captured by
H. H. Dunlap's King Cadenza, in 2:25,
with II. Patrick's Butcher Boy o close
second and Plunkett last. Mattie B also
started. Butcher Boy took the second
heat and second money. The special cart
race was a walkover for Frank Merrill's
Bonnie B. with G. Tassi's Headlight sec
end and M. OConnell's Josh third. Time,
1:43. In the second heat, however, J. Mc-
Donald's Nancy captured the second
money. Headlight taking third money
and Josh finishing outside. Time. 2:36.
The steer race caused lots of fun. Wild
Bill, owned by Edward O'Uay. was heav
ily backed and proved a cinch. M. M.
Slater's Golden Gate was second and Sil
verberg's Bandy third. The vaqueros'
quarter-mile dash was won bv Edward
O'Day's Silver Dick, with AVilllam Har
ney's Cricket second and J. O'Connor's
Shoot the Chutes third. The other start
ers were: Ray Mead's Poso. E. Sullivan's

Some Funny Features ol the Butchers' Annual Outing.
Byron's strength was Intermittent, but
it was none the less real. He was inca
pable of prolonged or steady effort, only
too apt to sink into cynical pessimism,
but always capable of rallying to noble
action. Perhaps the source of his weak
ness and his strength alike is found In
things. Nature herself at times seems to
"The power of Byron's personality," It
has been said, "lies In his splendid and
imperishable excellence of sincerity and
strength." This Is an admirable appre
ciation, and yet it has been doubted. To
many Byron's greatest fault as a poet
seems a lack of sincerity, shown by his
fondness for a pose of mysterious gloom
and a too public parade of his bleeding
heart. His strength aa well as his sincer
ity has been denied, and hostile critics
point out his lack of self-control, his jeal
ousy, his Inability to accomplish any one
great work. But such criticisms, after
all, are one-sided, fixing upon the defects
and overlooking the better part. That
there waa much of affectation in Byron's
character and work is not to be denied.
The circumstances of his birth and train-
Ing, the corruption of the social atmos
phere in which ho moved, made this In
evitable. It was not, Indeed, till the blow
fell upon him which broke off his rela
tions with a society that first pampered
and then pelted him. that his genuine na
ture appeared. There is hardly a handful
of sincere verses in his work before the
"Domestic Pieces" of 1816, and we have
only to compare the later with the earlier
cantos of "Childe Harold" to see what an
Immense gain has been made by discard
ing the stagey figure of the nominal hero
and allowing the poet to speak for him
self. From this time on his Imperishable
excellence of sincerity revealed itself
more and more clearly. Byron was sin
cere In his love for nature, especially in
her wilder and stormier aspects; he was
sincere in his love for liberty, and even
morr sincere In his hatred of the oppres
sion In the name of order and religion,
which was then all powerful In Europe.
And he hated with a tlery personal hatred
the sham and cant that spread a thin
veneer of morality over the deep corrup
tion of English society. And the last can
tos of "Childe Harold" and "Manfred,"
the "Prisoner of Chillon" and the "Vision
of Judgment" and "Don Juan" are ever
lasting memorials of the sincerity of his
love and of his hatred.

POETRY.
XXII. GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH
take the pen out of hi* hard, aa Arnold
says, and to deprive him of his style. Yet
the likeness of Wordsworth seems to be
reflected !n every mountain tarn and the
very hills re-echo the magic music of the
streams unheard by day:
Whllp In sweet cadence, risir.fr small nn<i still.
The far-off minstrels of the haunted hill.
As the laat bleating of the fold expires.
Tune in the mountain dells their watery lyres.
How different the associations of Goethe
and Schiller with 'Weimar and the sur
rounding country! Here It la in the pal
ace, park and library that one ltngers to
recall the visions of the past. From Ry
dal mount the Influence of Wordsworth
diffuses itself over the whole district.
Despite the local environment of Words
worth's verse there Is nothing to suggest
limitation to the flight of the poet's Imag
ination. An acre or the lake region woulr!
have sufficed to provide the mlse en seen*
needful to the Wordsworthian mind an<i
temper. The spiritual eye sees visions In
the water drop. It would often seem that
Wordsworth valued his mountains more)
for the seclusion and retirement offered
by them than for their beauty. This ut
terance may seem heresy. But a tramp
through the English lake district will re
veal beauties still unnamed. Such color
effects as are to be seen on the sheeny
mountain slopes of slaty gneiss, resplen
dent with a fiery bath of sunrise and sun
set, do not reappear In the poet's descrip
tions. And how little of the romance of
this varying region of lake and mountain
did Wordsworth Impart to us. Here was
a Scott wanting. All the world, then,
would have known the mysteries of tarn
and fell. The background would have be
come as familiar to us as the land of
Burns and Scott. With those writers
these old hills of slate" and porphyry from
Sklddaw to Scafell: these mountain lakes,
heaven-reflecting, from Dcrwentwater to
Wlndermere, would have served as scenes
before which the loves and hates of man
from the agone day3 of ancient Britons
to the modern lake dweller might have
been enacted. But Wordsworth found his
poetic Inspiration In nature rather than
in man. and he preferred to let us share
In this joy rather than In poetic romances
about man.

Clara Kopp Wrote for Mrs. Pinkham's Ad-
rice and Tell* what It did for Her.
" Dear*Mrp. Pixkiiam : â I have seen
bo many letters from ladies who were
cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's remedies
that I thought I would ask your advice
jtmgm. in regard to my condition.
I have been doctoring for
* our years and have
taken different pat-
ix^sffil! ent medicines > but
i Bi^^^ received very little
jg^^|rafi| benefit. I am
I Â§5^" troubled with back-

t*~j from you . at once." â
Clara. Kopp, Rockport,
Ind., Sept 27, 1898.
"I think it is my dnty to write a
letter to you in regard to what L.ydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound did
for me. I wrote you some time ago,
describing" my symptoms and asking
your advice, which you very kindly
gave. I am now healthy and cannot
begin to praiso your remedy enough.
1 would say to all suffering women,
' Take Mrs. Pinkham's advice, for a wo-
man best understands a woman's suf-
ferings, and Mrs. Pinkham, from her
vast experience in treating female ills,
can give you advice that you can get
from no other source.' " â ClajUl KorP.

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, May 23.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The wool matkrt has manifested but very lit
tle life the past week, trade at times being at a
complete standstill. Reports from the goods
market ore not altogether encouraging and con
sumers are cautious about buying stuck pending
the opening of the lightweight season. Prices
are In buyers' favor, the strengthening tendency
at the London sales having exercised no appre
ciable effect on values here. In the country
there has been more doing and especially in
Wyomlns, but the view? of growers of wool
generally are still so high that representatives
of the Eastern trade are not as yet buying very
freely. The result Is that comparatively lew of
the new wools have yet come forward.
His Preference
Frau Hingstermeler, the wife of Herr
Hingstenneler, the lion tamer, was what
may * be* termedâ to put It mildlyâ a vir
ago, and held Hingstermeler In absolute
subjection. The lion tamer returned to
the family caravan one evening in a state
of hilarity, which made him feel that he
would better postpone an interview with
his better half until his condition had
worn off. He therefore concluded not to
sleep In the family quarters. The next
morning his wife called him to acdount.
and he explained that he had been hav
ing a little jollification and did not wish
to disturb her slumbers on his return.
"Where did you sleep?" she demanded.
"In the cage with the lions." he replied
meekly. "Coward!" hissed Mrs. Hinpster
meler. with a look as one robbed of her
just dues.â New York Life.
M Raphael BIschoffshelm has made
over the freehold of the Nice Observatory
which he founded, together with $300,000
to be devoted to the maintenance of the
establishment." The total value of the
gift is considered to be worth $1,000,000.
and the continuance of the work is as
surcd by the munificent gift.

to repeat yesterday's lively demonstration In i
Pupar in a hope that the traders would find I
rufficiem prl^e movement in that stock to J
yield profits en the day's turn, but the stock j
deveirped its customary obstinacy and refused i
to advar.ee to any marked extent, perhaps to
hold what moderate gain tv?.s made. Its ex
treme range was 2^. and It closed at a net
loss of *fc. The street was flooded with "tips"
this morning rromlslng a repetition of yes
terday's sudden Jump and the professional j
traders took on etock quite llbtraily. The \
clorlng out of short contracts yesterday left j
the market without tujiport on that account â¢
and the buying did not extend much beyond I
the ranks of thÂ» jirofessional bulls. In spite |
of the announcement of the further advance !
of 10 cents a hundred pounds In refined suijar I
made by the American Company and followed |
by the other refiners ther-Â» was not tiuflicient
demand f->r the ftock to enable the traders 'Â¦
to tike their profits and the price was brought ;
bark to about where It started under pres- 1
cure of that process. To-day's advance in the j
price cf ref.neJ supar makes a total of 13 |
cents a hundred pounds during the week and i
th~ quick if Â¦jonw made by all the companies j
to the advance pave color to the persistent |
assertion that a working agreement has been j
arrived at Ivtwfpn the rival companies. The !
fact of a concurrent advance at the end of
the dull teason in thÂ» trade and with the large
demand incident to the canning ras.n to be !
met detracts from the protestations made with j
officiaJ fsanctlon that business is conducted un- |
that an Irrepressible conflict still rases be- I
fween the r>- liners. American Tobacco made j
a further advance to-day, which was better â¢
held than that of Sugar and the price of '
Brooklyn Transit waÂ« bid up sharply when J
large buylnt? orders were detected In the stock. ;
In the general list iher* was some show of j
firmness early in the day, but it was pot well j
held In atay case an' 1 , prices of some railroad
stocks drifted below last night's level. The Â¦
Pacifies made the b*>st show of strength, es- I
pecially Northern Pacific, which was affected ]
Ly rumors of an increased dividend rate and j
was benefited also by the timely rains In the !
northwestern wheat country. The buying of '
Northern Pacific was attributed in part to j
Berlin account. International houses were
sellers on balance to some extent, the foreign
markets continuing generally depressed. A
number of the large professional operators in
stocks are preparing for vacation trips to Eu
roj>e and some of the buying of stocks is Eaid
to be the closing out of accounts on the short I
t\6Â« for their benefit. The small shipment of j
rold for Europe announced during the day
wu not unexpected and had little effect on !
the stock market. It Is understood that It Is
made rvsslble only by rpeclal Inducements i
offered by the IS&nk of France, the occasion j
being the special needs for currency Incident
to the exposition. J
The bond market was dull and email irregu- 1

Cherries are slightly higher, owing to re
duced receipts. The canners have raised their
bids In Alameda County, which is a wise
move, as it is reported that new canneries
are starting up here and there, and It is a very
easy master for fruit growers to start small
canneries if the combine squeezes them. Such
would be the 6ure result
Berries continue to bring very good prices
and there Is no accumulation of stock.
Peaches and Apricots keep up, though the
demand Is not very sharp. Arrivals of Plums
and Apples are small. *

Butter is quoted excessively dull, though
there is no decline. Receipts have been com
ing In soft during the past day or two, and
fine hard Butter is firm in consequence, while
the soft lots are weak. Eggs are slow and
some dealers are shading the quotations to sell.

NEW YORK, May 23.â Great excitement pre
vailed at the Cotton Exchange to-day. An enor
mous business was transacted. Prices broke
rapidly immediately after the opening, which
was at an advance of 2<2'6 points on buying by
parties who thought the market had experi
enced decline enough. There was a steady
stream of selling orders from the south and the
room trading contingent were quick to detect
the Inherent weakness of the situation. They
also became heavy sellers. August liquidation
was a feature. The August price broke 33
points from the call figures, this being a decline
of about 100 points since the selling movement
was instituted. The primary cause of the weak
ness was the supprlatlve average of crop ac
counts reachlnc this market and cabled to
Great Britain and the Continent. Foreign sell
ing orders were very heavy. The market closed
at about the lowest point of the day .

ACCORDING to the statement of J. Beach of 519 Sixteenth street, Oakland,
there must have been two men by the name of Thomas H. Jones, one of
whom committed suicide by jumping from the steamer 'San Pedro while
the vessel was lying In Drakes Bay, wheije she put for shelter during a
heavy etorm.
When the suicide's body was found a few days later a search of his pockets
by the finders revealed only a nickel and the people of San Rafael and Petaluma
started a story of foul play, claiming that Jones had been robbed of his money
and then thrown overboard. They offered as a reason for their theory that
when last seen in Petaluma, where he was well known. Jones had exhibited con
siderable wealth and was in company with two suspicious characters.
Mr. Beach's story is to the effect that the body of the suicide is" that of
Thomas H. Jones, not of Petaluma. but resident of Colfax. who had relatives in
Grass Valley. Joseph Shelby, Mr. Beach's brother-in-law and also a resident of
Colfax, left with his wife on the San Pedro for Nome, where they intend to open
a restaurant, and before leaving paid fo~ a passage for T. II. Jones, who was
without funds, and agreed to give him employment In the northern city.
Beach says Jones had five or six friends on the steamer and that he drank
heavily just before his departure on the northern trip. Mr. Beach received a let
ter from "William Rowland, purser of the San Pedro, written at the time the
vessel was in Drakes Bay, stating that It was a clear case of suicide while men
tally unbalanced, and that there was no mystery about the matter at all. Beach
says that his friend Jones had not been at Petaluma and that there must be an
other Thomas H. Jones. This faises the Question of ..what has ; become of the
other Jones, the man with tho money and the suspicious acquaintances.

The protest of plx members of Company
K, First Infantry, N. G. C, against tho
ruling of Major Hendey that E. M.
O'KUey and Otto Schwerdtfeger could not
be candidates for any commission was
heard yesterday afternoon by Brigadier
General Warfleld in the office of Major
Dorn. judge advocate. The whole matter,
it was agreed, should be decided upon a
stipulation of facts, namely, that E. M.
O'Riley was elected first lieutenant of
the company, failed to pass the exam
ining board and be recommended for a
commission: that subsequently at an
election to fill vacancies ORiley, who had
failed to pass for lieutenant, was nomi
nated for the position of captain, when
Major Hendey ruled that he was in
eligible, aÂ« the regulations declare that
no one can be a candidate for the same
commission within six months after fail-
Ing to pass the examining board, and ho
he!d that the intent of the regulation was
that it was for any commission: that the
Protestants claim that the regulation does
rot impose any such inhibition.
'as to Schwerdtfeger. who had failed to
nass for captain, it was stipulated that he
would have been nominated for first lieu
tenant had it not been for Major Hendey's
rl Thc brigadier general will give his de
cision in the matter within five days, after
wl'ich the findings will through proper
channels be forwarded to the adjutant
general's office.
During the hearing Captain Cunning
ham who was elected to command the
company, asked O'Ritey if It was not a
fact tha't an agreement had been entered
Into by himself and Schwerdtfeger to re
verse positions and seek the commissions
In order to "beat the regulations." To
this O'Riley stated that he did not know
of any sucti agreement.

DERMOTT WAS NEAR DEATH
WHEN HE KILLED HIMSELF
The body of Thomas Dermott, better
known as McDermott, was delivered to an
undertaker by order of the Coroner yes
terday. It will be embalmed by order of
the relatives, and the funeral will be de
ferred until the arrival of Dermott's sis
ter, Maxine Elliott, who Is en route to this
city with the Nat Goodwin company.
Dr. Leland performed an autopsy upon
the remains yesterday. He found that
even if Dermott had not taken poison he
would have died within a short time, as a
result of a complication of heart and kid
ney diseases brought on by over-indul
gence in liquor. The stomach, however,
was very much inflamed and showed
traces of poison, hence that organ was
removed and given to the City Chemist
for analysis.

The work of Amedee Joullin, artist

eminent source. Yesterday the artist was
delighted to receive from A. de Trobriand,

French republic to the United States, to trans

of France accompanies the diploma of the
Academy.
The paintings which won the decoration
were: "The Weaver." "Watching tho
Prisoner." "The Carver of Hieroglyph
ics," "The Death of Chief Ramona." and
"The Passing of the Wampum Belt."
In the recognition which Mr. Joullin re
ceives the Native Sons of California are
honored, as he was born in San Francisco
and beean his art studies here. He stud
led twfi years under Virpril Williams and
Jules Tavernier. In Paris he studied un
der Bourgereau, Robert Fleury and in the
Government Academy of Beaux Arts. He
was a professor at Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art, San Francisco, for a period of
ten years, replfrnlnp his position to study
the aborigines of New Mexico and Ari
zona.
The decoration which Mr. Joullin will
henceforth be entitled to wear is beauti
ful. It "is formed of palm and oak leaves
in silver, with purple enamel and attached
to a purple ribbon.
The Auditor's statement of the esti
mated deficit' came too late for any action
on the expenditures of this month, but it
ia intended that many radical measures of
economy shall be introduced to save the
city from bankruptcy. It Is the consensus
of opinion among city officials that It
would be much better to leave the streets
unswept for one month than to leave a
large number of bills unpaid.
The Mayor has ordered a general ac
counting up to the first of June and Ex
pert Williams of the Finance Committee is
now preparing the figures. Upon his re
port will be based the measure of economy
which each department will be required to
practice. The sweeping of streets will. In
all likelihood, be discontinued and then
the long suffering taxpayer may also bo
obliged to put up with dark streets all
night Instead of half the night. Â¦
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors is now considering the advis
ability of letting the streets go unswept
during the month of June, thereby effect
ing a saving of $28,000. This money will be
applied to making up a portion of the
threatened deficit at the end of the fiscal
year. Three months ago when measures
were taken by the city officials to reduce
the expenditures of the municipal govern
ment it was decided to cut one day off
weekly in * the street sweeping schedule,
thus saving aA>out $2000 per month. It was
agreed that should the deilcit not be wiped
out before then the street sweeping would
be stopped during June and possibly in
May.

SAN RAFAEL. May 23.â Otto Gronat
ka, the young man who. driven Insane by
excesses, wandered to the hills and made
his den in the railway tunnel near Reed's
station, made an atempt yesterday to
wreck a southbound passenger train. But
for the alertness of Engineer Fred Grant
the plan of the maniac would have been
crowned with success and a serious wreck
have resulted.
The train had just dashed out of the
tunnel when Grant saw a wild figure leap
from the track, over which he had been
bending Intently, and hound up the side of
the cutting to the hilis. The next mo
ment Grant saw that there was a large
coupling pin laid across the rails. He
reversed his engine and managed to stop
short of the obstruction, which might
have hurled an entire trainload of passen
grers to their death.
Gronatka was examined for lunacy
some time ago, but the doctors refused to
commit him to an asylum, claiming that
he was not dangerous. Local trainmen,
however, claim that the inhabitant of
Reed's timnel is a menace to public safe
ty. His latest escapade will no doubt re
sult in his committal to Ukiah, and
search parties are now scouring the hills
in pursuit of him.

"We were working on coal cars, which
had been run down from the main line
"While I admit that I opened the switch
and forgot to go back and throw it after
my train wont over, it seems to me it
was as much the duty of the other men
to see that it was set right as myself.
McCuen was one of a crew of four men
handling the freight at the Alameda Point
yards. The others were Foreman Joseph
Stormer, Frank Burns and John Bird.
His statement to the Coroner was as fol
lows:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, May 23.
THE responsibility for the wreck of
the Southern Pacific broad-gauge
Oakland local at Alameda Point yes
terday afternoon has been placed by
the railroad company upon Arthur R. Mc-
Cuen, one of the yard switchmen at the
point, who has admitted that he opened
the switch which derailed the local- and
forgot to throw It after the train he was
working on had passed. Upon this state
ment, which McCuen made this afternoon
to Coroner Mehrmann, the switchman
Â¦was .given into the custody of Chief ot
Police Conrad of Alameda and booked at
the City Prison on a charge of man
slaughter. Justice Morris released the
prisoner upon his own recognizance. He
was subpenaed to appear to-morrow
evening at the inquest which will be held
In the cases of Engineer Frank J. Shaw
and Fireman Henry Wetzell, who were
killed In the wreck.
Roland Bendell and E. Bendell have
started a Btibscription fund with a check
for $50 for the relief of Engineer Shaw's
family. He left a wife and eight chil
dren, the youngest of Â¦whom is only 6
months old. The funeral Â¦will be held
Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock, from the
family residence. 800 Twenty-seventh
street, under the direction of Leland Stan
ford Division No. 2S3, Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Engineers, of which the de
ceased engineer was r prominent mem
ber. Engineers W; R. Hatfleld, Isaac Jor
dan and J. Qulnn have charge of the ar
rangements. Pacific Lodge. A. O. U. W.,
will also take part in the funeral. The
arrangements for Fireman Wetzel's fu
neral have not yet been made.
The cleartnp of the wreck was accom
plished with celerity. All of the smashed
cars were hauled out of the way of traffic
by morning. The demolished tender was
on trucks and out of the way by noon.
Before nightfall the wrecking crew had
the locomotive raised, and temporary
tracks were b*vng laid to move it out of
the ditch In front of the Bay View House.
Had not the engine been reversed it would
have plunged through the front of that
building. As it was, the porch and en
trance underpinnings were demolished.
gineer Shaw had warning of the Impend
ing disaster In time to make a heroic
sacrifice of his life to save the pasnengera
on his train. That report Is verified by a
story which comes from Peter Rodgers,
an employe of the railroad company, who
was In the first car of the wrecked train.
Rodgers declares he heard Wetiel yell
"Look out for the switch" just before the
crash came.
HENRY WETZEL..
"The woman was not fifty feet from my
engine when she stepped on the track."
said Engineer Clark. "I whistled, but she
did not seem to hear It. I threw the re
versing lever over, but It was too late and
the engine struck her full."
She must have rolled under the train
after that, for the body was taken out
from under the wheels and was cut In
two.
The train was bound west and was Just
pulling into Center street station, when
Mrs. Troy' made her appearance walking
down Center street. She apparently paid
no attention to the approaching train and
walked right onto the track directly In
front of the locomotive. In spite of the
fact that Engineer Clark was blowing his
whistle.
Mrs. Troy must have been deeply ab
sorbed In thought or she would certainly
have seen and heard the train. Engineer
Clark says he expected every moment
that she would turn and walk parallel
with the train, but Instead of that she
walked directly in front of the engine.
The train was in charge of Engineer Clark
and Conductor Leitner.

Mrs. Kate Troy, the wife of John H.
Troy, one of the best-known insurance
men In Oakland, was struck by the Sev
enth street local train this evening and In
stantly killed. When the body was taken
out from under the train It was found
that the wheels had passed over her at
the waist, cutting her fairly In two.

to the siding to be weighed. The srrttch
had been opened to take the cars off to
the scales. I opened It and went down to
another switch and then rode out on the
cars. I did not pay any attention to the
switch after that."
The switchman said he had not worked
at the point more than eight times and
was not as familiar with the switching
as other men in the crew. To Trainmas
ter A. H. "Walker, who has charge of the
running of trains on the broad and nar
row gauge system, McCuen made similar
admissions. Division Superintendent Fra
zler has suspended McCuen, but none of
the other members of the yard crew has
been relieved from duty.
Trainmaster Walker made the following
explanation to-day concerning the acci
dent:
"Tho switch which caused the trouble
is known as a ground switch. After dark
a light is set at the lever so that if It is
not 'thrown' the engineer has a red dan
ger signal to guide him. During the day
time there is no signal for this sort of a
switch, although the trainmen can usu
ally see the condition of it.
"The yard crew went to work hauling
coal cars on the narrow gauge transfer
freight boat. They would run them from
the narrow gauge spurs down that por
tion of the main line which has a third
rail for the broad gauge, and then at this
switch the narrow gauge elding to the
scales and yard is met. After leaving thia
there is no third rail. With the switch
point flat against the rail, the only result
was to throw the broad gauge train off
the rails entirely, for its wheels could not
meet the narrow gaupe track.
"Within eight feet from the point of* the
switch the engine left the track and then
pounded over the ties and timbers.
"McCuen should have attended to th*Â»
switch after he drew it to let his train
back on the siding. He has been work
ing about the yards off and on for a year
and should have been familiar with thf
duties. Nothing has yet been done in re
lation to the other men. Those in charge
of trains are responsible for the acts of
the switchmen and brakemen under
them."
Engineer William Osborn, who had
charge of the yard engine at Alameda
Point, made a report to Trainmaster
Walker to-day, which indicates that En-

There has been discovered by the State
Medical Institute, 203 Elektron building.. Fort
Wayne, Ind., the most remarkable Blood Prison

dications as mucous patches , in the mouth,
core throat, copper colored spots, chancres,

completely changed the whole body into a
clean, perfect condition of physical tealth.
Every railroad running into Fort Wayne bring9

GRAPE-NUTS.
A SCIENTIFIC BREAKFAST.
Rightly selected food uill cure more
than haJf the diseases. Try a scientific
snd healthy breakfast: Fruit of sonic
kind, preferably cooked; a dish of
Grnpe-N'uls, with cream; two soft-
boiled eg?s. Put two eggs in a tin pint
cup of boiling water, cover and set off
f&r nine minutes. Whites will then be ths
coT!si?trncy of cream and most easily
digested. One slice of bread with but-
ter; cup of Posttim Cereal Food Coffee.
On that breakfast you can work like
a hor^e and be perfectly nourished un-
til noon. Your nervous troubles, heart
palpitation, stomach and bowel trouble?.
kidney complaints and various other
disorders will gradually disappear and
firm solid health will set in.
Why? You have probably been Iiv-
ing on poorly selected food â that is.
food that decs not contain the required
elements the body needs. That sort of
food, and coffee, is the direct or indi-
rect caur^e of more than half the ills the
human body acquires.
Grape-Nuts is a .perfectly cooked
food and both that and the Postum
Food Coffee contain fine microscopic
particle; of phosphate of potash ob-
tained it: a natural way from the j?rain>
of the field and by scientific food ex-
perts incorporated into food and drink.
That element joins with the albumen in
food to imke matter, which is the
filling of the brain cells and the nerve
centers all over the human body.
A man or woman thus fed is scien-
tifically fed and rapidly Â«rows in vigor!
j'.nd vitality, and become* capable ofi
conducting successfully the affairs ofi
life. To produce a perfect body and a j
money making brain the body must
hare the ricrht kind of food, and the ex-
pert food specialist knows how to make
it. That is Grape-Nuts and Postum

as a teacher. Among her distinguished

THEATRICAL NOTES
OF THE MIDWEEK
When the Grand Opera-house on
June 3 next it will not be for good, neither
will It be reopened again as a home of
the melodrama that filled It in days of
yore. For several months no carols oi
operatic stars will be heard there, but
during those months high-class dramas
will be presented by a company of: the
best artists In the country, according to
the statement made yesterday by Lewis
H. Bishop, acting manager of the house.
It will be interesting to theater goers
to know that' T. Daniel Frawley has been
In New York for five weeks securing the
players who are to form the new com
pany at Morosco's. He is acting for an
other person and the aggregation is no;
even to be known as the Frawley Com
pany.
"We will reopen some time In July,"
said Mr. Bishop, "and continue to pre
sent high class dramas at our present
prices until November 12 next, on which
date the Grau Opera Company opens in
the house. The company we shall secure
will be one of the best In America. It
will be far superior to the Frawley Coiru
pany. The best and latest plays will be
presented.
"Our opera venture paid, but not well
enough to justify us in continuing in that
line.
"Frawley's contract -with the Alhambra
people to open in their house June 3 does
not amount to anything, as his company,
which is now in Lcs Angeles, will soort
no longer exist as such. He has notified
the members that their contracts will ex
pire next Saturday night."
"Our people have known for some days
that the opera season was to end," said
Press Agent Gerald Dillon of the opera
house, "and so they were prepared for
the notice of last night. Their contracts
only call for a two weeks' notice. They
will all go back East, I think."
The Season Will Open in July and
Continue Until November Next,
When Grau Opera Com
pany Will Come.

While going to her room in the Girard.
House at Seventh and Howard streets
last evening Mrs. Logue, an elderly
woman, was attacked by a robber, who,
after knocking her down, snatched $2
from her hand. In falling the unfortunate
woman struck against the staircase,
breaking her right hip.
Mrs. Logue, who was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital, said she was employed
at the 5 Thomas Dyeing and Cleaning
Works *on Eleventh street, where she
made scarcely enough money to keep her
out of the poorhouse. Last evening she
drew $2 to pay the landlord a week's room
rent at the place where she was assaulted.
"Just before I reached the door 1 took
the money out of my purse and held it in
my hand," said the old woman, "and
started upstairs. Suddenly I was struck
from behind, and as I reeled around the
desperate robber again struck me, knock
ing me down. Grabbing my hand he
forced it open and took the money. My
purse had fallen from my hand, but he
picked it up and after examining it and
not finding anything *of value In it he
threw it away and disappeared."
Mrs. Logue describes her assailant as
being about SO years of age, rather tall
and weighing about 150 pounds. He was
dressed in a blue suit and wore a dark
slouch bat.
Detectives Crockett and Cody were at
once detailed on the case by Captain
Seymour, but up to a late hour last night
they had not succeeded in obtaining a
clew to Mrs. Logue's assailant.

Chinese alleged native-born American
citizens are melting away under the hot
fire of cross-examination conducted by
United States Attorney Coombs and As
sistant United States Attorneys Marshall
B. Woodworth and B. J. Banning. Messrs.
Coombs and AVoodworth took the first fall
out of the batch of thirty-six habeas cor
pus cases before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock and secured the
deportation of half a dozen of the alleged
native sons.
Late last week Mr. Banning took charge
of the cases and by a subtle line of ex
amination exposed willful perjury in three
cases and Secured the deportation of
the three. These cases prove two ! very
important facts: First, that the claims
of alleged native-born Chinese immigrants
are in nine out of ten cases without any
foundation whatever, except perjury, and
second, that this perjury can be exposed
by skillful cross-examination.
The Chinese method is for the applicant
and his witnesses to agree upon a certain
story. This they learn by rote so that
they may tell it in court without hesita
tion. The American method is* to allow
the witnesses to tell the story and then
cross-examine them as to the qetalls. l<or
instance, in the case of Leong Hin Duck
a few days ago the uncle of the boy told
the usual story as to his having been
present and having assisted at the ac
couchment of the petitioner's mother at
the time he was born in a house on Du
pont street, and to having seen the boy
half a dozen times every day from his
birth to the exact second that the steamer
left the wharf bearing the petitioner away
to China.
After he had told his story he was asked
whether he had seen the boy in the
County Jail. The uncle denied that he
had ever been to the jail, in spite of the
fact that two white witnesses were pres
ent who were ready to swear that they
had seen him there on more than one oc
casion in conference with the boy. It was
therefore evident that the man was lying,
and the boy was ordered deported.
In another case the petitioner , swore
that he lived in the twelfth house on the
second alley, in a certain village in China
after he left his I native land. California,
to spend a few years with his relatives.
The â¢ cousin of the petitioner was then
brought into court and swore that the
petitioner and himself lived in the fourth
house in. the third street of the village.
"But," suggested United States Attor
ney Coombs, "the petitioner here sworo
that it was the twelfth -house." '
The cousin reflected for a moment. Then
his face- brightened as he said in Chinese
to Interpreter Jones:: "That's easily ex
plained.^ The fourth house on the third
street, did I say? Yesâ don't you see that
four houses multiplied by three- streets
make Â¦ twelve houses? And that ; agrees
with my cousin's statement that it was
the twelfth house." : .

The Nome fleet will soon all be on the
way. The Charles D. Lane will probably
get away for the gold fields to-morrow,
while the St. Paul, Valencia and Noyo
will follow her on Saturday. The St. Paul
will connect at St. Michael with the river
boats for Dawson and the Valencia will
go to Cape York and Golofnln Bay, after
calling at Nome, while the Noyo will go
from Nome to Cape York and Port Clar
ence.
Among those who will go away on the
St. Paul is William H. Metson of the law
tirm of Reddy. Campbell & Metson. He
goes north in the interests of the Pioneer
Commercial Company, of which Captain
Charles Nelson is president, and also of
Messrs. Mordaunt, Blake, Libby and half
a. dozen more of the big mining men in
the Nome district. Messrs. Orton and
.Sullivan, from the office of Reddy, Camp
bell & Metson, have gone ahead of Mr
Metson in the steamer Zealandia, and will
have quarters ready for him on his ar
rival. Mr. Metson will be banqueted bv
his friends at the Bohemian Club to
night.
Among those who will go north on the
Charles D. Lane will be S. Knight of the
law firm of Page, McCutchen, Harding &.
Knight. The chances are the firm will es
tablish a branch office at Nome, but Mr
Knight is going north primarily in the'in
terests of Charles D. Lane.
Besides their attorneys, each concern i*
taking north about fifty men, all well
armed. One contingent will work the Pio
neer Commercial Company'sclaims, while
the other is under contract to Charles D
Lane. Their arms will be used to protect
the gold that it is expected will be dug
out of the ground. These preparations
gave rise to a story that there was to be
a race north between the steamers C D
Lane and St. Paul and that there would
be fighting over claims when the vessels
reached Nome. The facts of the case are
as above stated.
H -Warren, the representative of the
Onisbo Mining Company, will be another
passenger on the St. Paul. He is taking
w , U Jl hIm a lar ? e force of men and some
of the finest mining machinery that will
go north this year. The company repre
sented by Mr. Warren owns quite a num
ber of claims and has some large Interests

at the gold fields Mr. Warren will lose no
time in getting to work.

Julius Arnold, senior member of the law
firm of Keighley & Co. of London, Eng
land, was arrested at the ferry yesterday
afternoon by United States Marshal Shine,
on a warrant charging him with embez
zlement committed in England. The man
Is wanted for an alleged theft of Â£3fXX)
from an estate which was placed in the
keeping of the firm of which he is a mem
ber. AVhen taken he at first denied his
identity and now refuses to state anything
whatever about the case. He says, ftow
ever, that he will not resist extradition,
and is willing to go back to tace those
who accuse him.
Arnold sailed from London under the
assumed name of McKay on March 24.
Just previous to his departure the firm
of Keighley & Co., solicitors, became
bankrupt and later he was accused of
theft, tie came ;Â»lmost direct to Califor
nia and his description, with a request for
his apprehension, was given to Marshal
Shine about eight days ago. The British
Consul had been wortctng on the case for
some time and supplied the United States
authorities with a warrant for the arrest.
In this city much mall matter was re
ceived by the wife of the alleged embez
zler in the name of Mrs. Edith Clarke.
From this the Marshal obtained his lead
and yesterday caused a decoy letter to be
placed in the Postofflce box. Arnold took
the letter and was followed by a secret
service man and the Marshal. At the
ferry building Arnold purchased a ticket
for Berkeley and Just as he stepped out
of the office was confronted by the Mar
shal, wha addressed him by his right
name. He i unconsciously returned the
greeting, but hastily attempted to correct
himself, and was placed under arrest..
Secret Service Agent R. S. Brown took
the suspect In charge and after an hour's
teaious work finally forced the confession
that he was the person wanted by the
London authorities. Arnold will neither
admit nor deny his guilt. He says he in
tended to remain in California and start
in business under an assumed name. His
arrest was a surprise to him, but he will
make the best of the circumstances and
will return to England without any legal
proceedings. At his own request he was
permitted to remain under the charge of
a deputy Marshal in the Walmouth Hotel,
Berkeley, last night, where his wife re
sides. He is 39 years of age. His wife is
paid to be distantly connected with the
English nobility.

Martinelli stands high, and speculation
upon the successor of Leo XIII has often

so it is announced. Archbishop Martinelli

Pope's Personal Representative in This
Country Will Arrive This Morning
With Father Yorke.
After only one day's testimony the Mc-
Glade case has ' developed holes big
enough to drive a coach and four through.
There is an error in the indictment that
brings a tmiie to the faces of the de
fendant's counsel every time the instru
ment is referred to. John J. Cathcart,
the principal witness against the defend
ant, is missing', and the last heard of
him he-was ehecking. his.trunk for a jour
ney Kast. The Deputy Sheriff who arrest
ed McGlade has telegraphed to the pros
ecution that be has broken his arm and
cannot attend, and Clarke, the man who
had charge of the sewer gangs of the
Street Department, may be ruled out as
a. witness altogether, because his name is
not properly given in the accusation.
The absence of Cathcart may prove a
serious blow to the prosecution, fcr he is
the only inan who can prove McGlade's
ticnature, and proof of this and also of
McGlade's handwriting mutt be the basis
lor tse expert testimony connecting Jrt..-
ulade with the forgeries. Cathcart has
been in court at almost every session at
which the AlcGlade case came up, but he
has not been in attendance tnis week. His
at'sence was not noticed until inomas
Clarke told Tom Gibson, the detective,
that he met Cathcart at the ferry tiepot
fcaturday evening, and Caihcart said ne
was going Kasl to take charge of the
business of some linn. Gibson at onte
started a hunt fcr the elusive witness,
but his search was in vain, lie has not
been able to rind Cathcari anywhere, and
the chances are that by now he is well
out ot the way ot any process from this
State.
Phillips, the Deputy Sheriff who arrest
ed McOiade. was up here sjme aays ago
when the case was called in Judge Cook s
absence. It was announced that the case
would go on, anyway, but when it was
called u wjis rut over until the return of
Judfc-e Cook. Phillips went back home to
Arizona, and now he has sent word that
a broken arm will ktop him from attend
ing the trial.
As to the error in the indictment, it may
â¢work the prisoner's liberty before the de
fense has done with it, although to an
tvervday man, with no st-pse ot the law,
it pe*ms trivial. McUiade is being tried
for the forgery of the name of 1 homas
Dwyer to a fraudulent demand for pay
ment for work done on the city's sewers.
In addition it is charged that all the other
signature? certifying to the demand are
iorg'.'d. ami Clark* was one of those
whose duty it was to keep track of the
men working on the sewers and indorse
their demands. His name was one of
t.h. ise said to be forged, but in the indict
ment he is described Â»is Thomas Y.
Clarke while on the stand he swore he
was 1 homas F. Clarke.
Immediately Attorney Lennon objected
to a:iy of his testimony on the ground
that he was not the man described in
ihe indictment, and it looked for a while
as if the court would sustain the ob
jection. He finally overruled it. however,
on the ground that the man's name was
Thomas Clarke, anyway, and there is a
long line of decisions which says the mid
dle initial is not material, but these do
cot bear upon indictments, and there is
a case on record where the Supreme
Court of this Slate reversed a conviction
because the indictment charged "larcy
as the crime instead of "Ltrceny.- 1 In
overruling the objection the court did so
on the understanding that the District
Attorney would be responsible, a risk
which Mr. Deuprey took upon himself.
The testimony Itself is bringing into the
light a strange and wonderful collection
of short memories. \Y. P. Ambrose, who
was Superintendent of Streets at the time
McGlarte was in his linancial prime, could
not identify his own signature on Mc-
Glade's certificate of appointment, nor
could he say it was McGlade's signature
that was signed to the acceptance. It was
so long ago that he really could not at
tempt to say if the signature was his.
Later on he" took hold of the "blotter,"
tlmebook and payroll of the office of the
HGperintendent of Streets for his term,
but he could not say if they were the
books of his administration. He kept
books, and the books were the same as
those handed to him and the entries were
the same and they were strangely famil
iar, but he could not say that the books
were hi=, and no amount of questions
Â¦would persuade him to do so.
Then Harrv Piper was called to show
the surprising shortness of his memory-
He was shown McGlade's oath of office.
It was signed by him as Chief Deputy
County Clerk, but he did not know it, nor
<-ould he say more than that the signature
looked like his signature.
Joe Goddard, the present Chief Deputy
County C!<-rk, was thea called, and he
Identified Piper's signature, getting a
Â¦cowl from the McGlade friends in the
courtroom for his pains. He was also
called on Jo identify the oath, but he
â¢would not do It, nor would he say more
than that it looked like an official docu
ment. It was afterward identified by
Gibson, who pot it from the County Clerk.

he knew- of the flight of Cathcart. swore
that he had all the powÂ«>rmen under his
charge: that he had to keep their time
and certify to their demands; that he had
no such man as Thomas Dwyer working
for him at the time the Dwyer demand
war presented and paid, nor before nor
after; and that he never certified to any
<iemand for Thomas Dwyer. But he
knew nothing of McGlade"s writing or his
signature.
John Ry.in, the only man with a good
memory called during the day, swore that
three receipts for demands in his record
book were written and signed by Mc-
Olade. He is a clerk in the officeof the
Hoard of Supervisors, and his duty is to
look after the demands. He declared that
the Dwyer demand never passed through
his hands.
The plan of the prosecution was to
prove MoG'.ade's handwriting, and for
that reason the d3y \v;iÂ«= spent flickering
over signatures. If Cathcart could be got
at he could porhnps -be made to swear to
Fome of McGlade's writing, but as it
focnis now no one will admit he ever saw
enough of McGlade's writing to know It
again and the slender thread of Ryan's
evidence and the few woids in the demand
record book may be all the experts will
have to work on.

BIG LEGAL GAPS
ARE YAWNING IN
McGLADE'S CASE
Ten of the eighteen delegates chosen to
represent the Republicans of California at
the National Convention to assemble at
Philadelphia, June 19, met at the Palace
Hotel yesterday afternoon. The delegates
present were: George A. Knight and Dr.
George C. Pardee at large.
First Districtâ Douglas S. Cone, Red
Bluff.
Second Diptrlctâ H. T. Power, Placer
County.
Third Districtâ R. D. Robblns, Suisun.
Fourth Districtâ Joseph Spear Jr. and
M. A. Gunst, San Francisco.
Fifth Districtâ W. C. Van Fleet, San
Francisco and H. G. Bond, Santa Clara.
Sixth Districtâ William Garland, Los
Angeles.
Delegates XV. S. Hooper, Dr. E. Hender
son and Dr. Cnester Rowell sent letters,
respectfully regretting inability to attend
ana agreeing to abide by any arrangement
made at the meeting.
W. C. Van Fleet took the Initiative by
calling the delegates to order and nomin
ating George A. Knight for chairman of
the delegation. Mr. Knight was unani
mously elected. The position of secretary
was given to Alternate E. D. Plexotto.
On motion of Delegate Garland the
chairman was authorized to appoint a
committee of three on transportation. The
chair appointed Garland, Cone and Van
Fleet.
The suggestion was made that George A.
Knight should be appointed on the com
mittee to engage neadquarters, as he
would be in Philadelphia before other
delegates arrived there. Knight and Van
Fleet were selected as a committee to ar
range for headquarters. It was the sense
of the delegation that first-class apart
ments should be engaged and that
agreeable accommodations for delegates
should bo reserved In the hotel where the
headquarters shall be established.
In discussing the subject of hotel ac
commodations the delegates expressed the
opinion that no time should be wasted.
It was admitted that the time had gone
by for getting suitable rooms at the
Lafayette or Walton.
Delegate M. A. Gunst was added to the
committee on headquarters. He was ad
vised to wire at once and get all the In
formation possible. Mr. Gunst announced
that he would immediately telegraph to
Sheriff Crow of Philadelphia.
Mr. Power said he expected to take some
friends and desired that rooms be en
gaged.
Mr. Van Fleet suggested that Mr. Gunst
should engage thirty rooms for delegates
and also one suite for neadquarters.
On motion of Mr. Power, it was decided
that the delegation should leave San
tranciseo on June 12. Delegates repre
senting Oregon, Washington and Nevada
will be invited to join the Callfornians.
Banners, badges, flags and decorations
were discussed. A committee consisting
of Delegates Pardee, Gunst and Alternate
Peixotto was appointed to perform duties
in the line of decoration. The committee
was authorized to procure 300 badges.
Wines, cigars and fruit were not over
looked. Mr. Gunst agreed to supply the
cigars. Delegates Cone, Garland, Power,
Bond and Alternate Steeve were commis
sioned to forage for fruit and wine.
Delegate Spear suggested that an as
sessment of $50 be levied on each delegate
and alternate. Delegate Gunst moved
that 1100 be the ilgure of the assessment.
Precedents were cited to prove the ampli
tude of $r>0. Delegate Van Fleet was in
favor of splitting the difference and mak
ing it $75. The latter iigure was accepted.
Delegate Robblns, the Sulsun banker, lm.
mediately flashed four twenties. Then it
dawned upon the chair that Robbins came
prepared to pungle $100. The sight of the
coin reminded the delegation that a treas
urer had not been chosen. Dr.. Pardee
was elected at once. He collected $303 on
the spot.
Progressive passenger agents, repre
senting the leading lines, were glad when
the delegates determined to express a
choice of routes. The railroad men had
been waiting for hours for a decision on
this point. George A. Knight spoke first,
declaring his choice to be: Central Pa
ciilc. Union Pacific. Chicago and North
western and Pennsylvania. Spear and
Van Fleet favored the Illinois Central
from the Missouri River to Chicago. Par
dee and Peixotto favored the New York
Central east of Chicago. Other delegates
accepted the route named by Knight sit
far as going to Philadelphia was con
cerned. There was no decision as to re
turn route. So many iron-clad conditions
are named and so many limitations im
posed that the transportation committee
may demand a new deal. The delegates
have resolved to come homo when they
please and over any route they may se>
lect. The round-trip rate of $SS 50 requires
that the delegate shall leave Philadelphia
homeward bound not later than June 26,
ind must go to the Missouri Rivei- by the
same route that he traveled over from
the river to the East. On the return trip
west of the Missouri the delegate has a
margin of choice.
