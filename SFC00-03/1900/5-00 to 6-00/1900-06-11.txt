WAR BETWEEN JAPAN

R. Fujisawa, a professor in the Imperial
University of Toklo. Japan, who passed
through Chicago on the way to the Paris
Exposition. Dr. Fujisawa continued:
"While there seems to be but little
doubt that the differences between Russia
and Japan must ultimately be settled by
war. it is impossible to predict when the
war may begin. Russia has pursued a
course which can be construed only as an
Intended provocation to war.
"Of course the utmost secrecy prevails
in ofQcial Japan as to the plans of the
Government, and officially there is noth
ing to indicate that war is expected.
"Work on the Japanese navy is being
pushed*as rapidly as possible. It is given
out that the completed navy will be no
larger than will be necessary for a nation
which is growing as is Japan to protect
her commerce and maintain her dignity
among the powers.
"The suddennes and raDldity with which
the work was begun and is being pushed,
however, indicate that other and almost
immediate use will be found for it. In
the East Russia is thought to be respon
sible for the 'Boxer' troubles, either di

DETAILS OF ENCOUNTERS
WITH CHINESE REBELS
LONDON, June 11.â Trouble has broken
out at Newchwang. The state of anar
chy around Peking is likely to be Initiated
In' many quarters. Asiatic artillery has
been ordered from Hongkong to Tientsin.
On Friday, according to a dispatch to the
Daily Express from Shanghai, a force of
Cossacks, reconnoitering outside of Tien
tsin, was attacked by a rabble of thou
sands armed with spears and swords and
some rifles. The Cossacks fired upon their
assailants, killing several. A Russian
lieutenant was wounded by a bullet in the
stomach.
There is a serious 'rising at Nanking.
The mob fs said to have attacked the pal
ace of the Viceroy.
' All -dispatches out of Peking are cen
sored in the Interest ot the Empress. ,
The determination of the foreign Minis
ters to increase the garrison at Peking
leads to a belief In foreign circles In Tien
tsin and Shanghai that the powers will
never leave the Chinese capital, but will
make China another Egypt. ~
,-DetaiIs have been received from Shang
hai regarding the recent murders of rail
way engineers by Boxers. It seems that a
party of thirty, including six ladies and
one child, left Pao Ting Fu in twelve
boats under military escort. After tra
versing fifty miles in safety they, missed
their way. The boats grounded and the
Boxers opened fire upon the unfortunate'
occupants, using both rifles and wooden
cannon. The engineers returned the . fire
effectively and the party landed. One lady
and three- men- got separated from the
main body. They were brutally killed.
The survivors formed a square with those
able to bear arms outside- and the women
inside and made off toward Tientsin. They
traveled three and a half days, fighting
all the /<Vay. More than 2000 cartridges
were expended and ammunition was^ run
ning short. They estimated that
killed at least a hundred Boxers.
The men behaved like heroes, carrying
the women and children. One lady of the
party was close to maternity.
Twelve miles from Tientsin three men
of a party disappeared and were mur
dered.' The survivors eventually met the
rescue party and, much exhausted, were
escorted to Tientsin. :
Sir Claude Macdonald. British Minis
ter In Peking, sent the following telegram
to Shanghai, on June 7:
"The movement against the foreigners,
which has been allowed to grow to such
an extent, has resulted in the burning of
railway stations and. in the Interruption
of railway communication for five days.
Two British 'missionaries and several for
eign missionaries have been murdered Â¦ in
the district near Peking. In the. country
round numbers of converts have been mu

ST. LOUIS. June 10.â The day Just
ended has been one of the most
eventful and bloody since the great
strike on the St. Louis Transit lines
began more -than a month ago.
There were numerous encounters between
Ftrlkers and other riotous Individuals and
the constituted authorities, resulting in
three deaths and the wounding of five or
more persons, mostly strikers. One of
ihe latter will die.
The day was quiet until thi* afternoon,
Â¦when the police were taken off a number
cf streetcar lines for the purpose of giv
ing- them a rest and to test the ability
cf the Trar.sit Company to operate with
out friction.
The rncst serious trouble broke out be
tween C and 7 o'clock In front of the six
etery store building on Washington ave
nue, between Broadway and Sixth street,
occupied by the Sheriff's posse comitatus
as a barracks and headquarters. Several
hundred etrikers had gone to Bast St.
Louis early in the day to attend a picnic
given for their benefit and toward even
lr.g began returning home. The trouble
was precipitated when 150 strikers In uni
form and headed by a drum corps came
west on Washington avenue. In their
caps some of them had cards bearing
these words: "Union or nothing-; liberty
or death." Â»
Just as they were passing the barracks
& car cf the Park avenue division was
going west. A number of the men broke
from the line and rushed for the car,
Â¦which was without the usual police guard.
A brick was thrown through the car win
dow and a shot was fired by somebody
not fcr.own. ,, . , _ Â¦ Amim i^ :
Deputies Use Shotguns.
At the first intimation of trouble mem
bers of the Sheriff's posse swarmed from
the buIMir.gr and surrounded the crowd
of strikers, calling on them to disperse.
Other shots were nred. Then several dep
uties turned loose their repeating shot
g-uns. loaded with buckshot. As far as
can be learned, only four men In the
strikers' ranks were hit. Not a deputy
â¢was wounded.
Atter the flght was over C. Edward
Thomas, a striking conductor, was picked â¢
x:p, shot in the breast. He died in an am- !
bulance on the way to the hospital.
George Rino, a Ftrikir.g motorman, re
ceived a terrible wound in the abdomen.
He was taken to the City Hospital and
died en the operating table-
E. D. Burkhardt, a striking: conductor,
received several buckshot In the side of
the head, causing a serious wound. He
may die.
Oscar Marvin, a striking conductor, will
probably lose his right hand, which was
t>ad!y torn by a load of shot. It is not
known whether any others were wounded
or not.
Vnder the command of Colonel Caven
<3er, the deputies arrested twenty of the
strikers and took them into the barracks,
where they were searched. Three re
volvers and a number of pocketknlvejs
v/ere secured and the prisoners were
taken to the Four Courts, where they
vrerc locked up. pending an investigation.
Prominent Men in the Fray.

PROVIDENCE, R. I., June 10.â By a
collision which occorred at "War
wick, on the suburban line of the-
Union Railroad, this noon, two cars
striking end on. four persons were
killed and more than twenty-five Injured,
of whom three are probably fatally hurt.
Ueutenant-Governor Kimball is among
those who are not expected to live.
Additions to the death list are hourly
expected, as several of the Injured are at
the hospital in a precarious condition. The
accident occurred through the efforts ot
Motorman Burroughs to make a switch on
the line, which is a single track. He had
been given the signal to go ahead, and
followed orders.. with the above results.
The accident took place on the suburban
line between this city and Oakland Beach,
a summer resort twelve miles distant.
Ordinarily the cars run on a thirty
minute schedule, but on Sundays the
travel is extremely heavy, and to-day
fifteen-minute time was in vogue. The car
left the city terminus-, and before it had
reached the outskirts of the city it was
packed passengers even standing In tho
aisles. ' When the car reached Warwick
station It stopped to allow passengers to
alight. According to schedule Conductor
Manchester should have waited a few
minutes at the turn-out to- allow the up
bound Oakland Beach car to pass. Ha
rang the signal to go ahead, and Motor
man Burronghs put on his power and thÂ©
car was soon speeding at a lively rate.
Just beyond the station is a curve, then a
straight stretch of road and then a sharp
curve in a deep cut. It is impossible for
a motorman to see beyond the curve, as
on the left is a high bank, hiding the rails
from view.
Telescoped on a Curve.
The regular car left Oakland Beach on
its trip to the turn-out at Warwick sta
tion. Suddenly there flashed before the
motorman's vision a car sweeping toward
him. The curve seemed to lend additional
speed to the cars. Quick as a flash
Motorman Hanlon shut off his power and
applied his air brakes, which stopped the
car Instantly. The down-bound car came
on in spite of the efforts of the motorman
to check its speed.
There was a crash, and the cars tele
scoped. The Oakland Beach car tore its
way through the other car. crushing all
before it like an eggshell. On to the nftn
seat went the bumper of the up-bound
car. carrying death and Injury in its wake.
Motorman Burroughs was instantly killed.
The scenes that followed were heart
rendinÂ§r. Under the wreckage were inani
mate bodies, whXe groans and shrieks of
the injured filled the air. Those who were
not Injured were frantic in their efforts to
locate their companions.
Calls were cent out for assistance, and a
corps of doctors were soon at the scene.
"Willing hands helped to extricate the In
jured, who Â¦were conveyed to the Warwick
station. Two cars were equipped with cots
and doctors, and assistants were dis
patched from this city to the wreck.
Removal of Dead and Injured.
The wounded were placed on the cars
and conveyed to the Elmwood station,
where ambulances from the hospital were
in waiting. Lewis C. Sanborn. who was
Injured internally, died on hi3 way to the
city. Mrs. Fred Andrews, a daughter of
Mr. Sanborn, was conveyed to the hos
pital in a precarious condition. Her In
juries consisted of an arm and fooi
crushed. Her spine was also Injured. She
Is reported dillrious and la not expected
to live.
The 13-month-old child of Mr. and Mrs.
George W. Baker -was killed. His parents
escaped with slisht injuries.
The fourth victim was Arthur G. LJÂ»
comb.
Among the passengers was Lleutenant-
Governor Charles L>. Klznball. He was
hurt Internally and received a concussion
of the brain. He was unable to be moved
from Warwick station, and it is thought
that his injuries will prove fatal.
Mary Tourtlllot is ario fatally injured,
her back being broken.
While the list of injured Is now num
bered at twenty-six, there are many per
sons whose Injuries cannot yet be deter
mined. At the hospital, where eight of thÂ»
Injured were conveyed, it is stated that It
Is expected that two will not survive tha
night.
The down-bound car was not equipped
with air brakes and hand brakes were not
equal to the emergency, and. In fact had
It been supplied with them it is a question
whether the car could have been af opped

LONDON, June 11 (3:30 a..m.).â The
Boers have torn up twenty-four
miles of Lord Roberts' vital llne'of
railway between America siding
and Roodville. It is a bold raid
and vexatious, but it does not disquiet
the military authorities as yet, for they
expect Generfl Kelly-Kenny to drive off
the marauders and reopen the line. The
rapidity of the advance of Lord Roberts
cannot have permitted him to accumulate
large reserves of stores. Therefore an
interruption of the railway, even for a
week, must embarrass the army and may
"bring the forward operations to a stand
still.
Nothing - has been heard from Lord
Roberts for three days. This raid on the
railway, the strenuous opposition to Gen
eral Rundle and the nimble escape of
Commandant General Botha's division
have forced the War Office observers to
the reluctant conclusion that the war is
not yet over, although even the occasion
al civilian Boer sympathizer cannot see
how the Boers will be able to do anything
to change the result. ,
General Buller is in Boer territory. Dis
patches of correspondents with him. tiled
at sunset yesterday, describe the corps as
camping at Gansoloi, close to the point
; where the frontiers of the Free State, the
Transvaal and Natal meet.
, "The British marched eight miles yes
terday," says a Reuter correspondent,
"before encountering any opposition. The
Boers, who had one gun. withdrew under
heavy ordnance nre to a ridge Just ahead
of the camp."'
Long Range Skirmishing.
This long-range running skirmish will
doubtless be renewed this morning. Gen

The fighting on June 6, in which there
were fewer than twenty j casualties, was
kept up all day. long by . musketry and
artillery. The British attacking line, three
miles. in length, made its way amid the!
precipitous hills. A Boer gun on Spitz
Kop ilred shrapnel rapidly at a range of
4000 yards at the British right flank, but
every shell was buried in the ground be
fore bursting. The defensive power of
modern weapons seems less effective in
rough country than upon levels, where
wide spaces can be covered with flat
trajectories. .
General Rundle's and General Brabant's
divisions are still at Hammond. The latest
intelligence from their headquarters is
that the Boers are determined to fight to
the bitter end. They are concentrating
4000 men around Bethlehem. The country
between them and General Rundle is
mountainous and exceedingly difficult for
military operations.
General Rundle's Task.
General Rundle's present care is to pre
vent the Boers getting past him south
ward. Major Wood of Rundle's staff rode
to a Boer outpost on June 6 and an
nounced that Pretoria had been occupied
by the British. How the Boers received
this news is not recorded. Altogether 600

Iron and Coal Shares Fall Twenty
i Five Points and Other Securi
ties Are Weak.
Â¦ BERLIN, June 10.â Last week was the
worst the Bourse had known for t,wenty
years. Many of the most substantial iron
and coal shares fell more than 25 points.
From Thursday conditions were very pan
icky, with phenomenal declines In both
lines of securities.' The banks forced
many weak customers to sell their hold
ings, the public thus suffering great
losses. The financial press refers to It as
"black week."
An impetus was given to the panic by
reports from the United States of the
overproduction of the iron market there
together with shutting down of mills and
reductions In prices. The situation Is
commented upon here as' foreshadowing
an Invasion of the German markot. With
in a week a first-class Westphallan firm
has purchased 12,000 tons of American
open hearth Iron from a London house.
It also appears that American foundry
iron has been offered in Berlin for Â£5
marks.
In all this the financial press sees the
danger of American competition already
becoming realized. A number of manu
facturers In Western Germany have
formed an organization for combating
American enterprise in iron and steel
eoods. -.
Thc\ Sllesian iron market Is also report
ed decidedly weak. ,
The decline of coal and iron shares
spread to other securities and other in
dustrials lost rather heavily. Bank shares
fell off also. The money market showed
no improvement and private discount
rose at the end of the week. Exchange
rates, however, tend in Germany's favor.

WASHINGTON. June 10.â The naval, ap
propriation bill just passed for the ensu
ing fiscal year is the largest in the history
of the navy during the time of peace. It
exceeds that of last year by $12,740,347 19,
and this rate of progress is likely to reach
the one hundred million dollar mark in
less than five years and to exceed that of
Great Britain in ten years. The chief in
terest in the present appropriation cen.
ters, of course, In the increase of the
navy, and there was but little friction be
tween the Senate and House to come to
an agreement on this subject.
Authority Is given to construct two bat
tle-ships of 13,500 tons each, three armored
cruisers of 13.000 tons each, three protect
ed cruisers each of S000 tons and five Hol
land submarine torpedo boats. The aggre

MANILA: June lO.-Judge William H.
Taft and his colleagues of the Philippine
Commission were beset during their first
week in Manila by a "multitude of callers
of all nationalities, professions and Inter
ests, who presented a bewildering assort
ment of recommendations touching mili
tary and civil policies. The Commission
ers maintained the altitude of un
prejudiced listeners. They admit that,
while they anticipate an enormous task,
the complexity and- difficulty of - the
problems and conditions are well nigh
staggering. .
They find General MacArthur adminis
tering civil and military affairs in a way
that is universally popular. The Filipino
party, embracing prominent insurrec
tionists who accepted American rule
through force 'of circumstances, is al
ready making the old proposition of au
tonomy under an American protectorate.
Judge Taf t s utterances Indicate a con
ciliatory policy toward the natives. He
has conferred with the high army officers,
some of whom strongly urge that a larger
army is necessary to suppress the Insur
rection, believing that civil government
will be' impossible until the rampant re
bellion in the southern districts of Luzon,
In the extreme northern provinces of the
island and in the Visayas, except Negros,
is crushed.
American experience with the natives
discourages the hope of honest govern
ment through them until a generation or
more have eradicated the results of
Spain's tutelage. . : ,-" Â¦Â¦Â¦-â¢- -v^/.
A large proportion of the provincial
officials already installed have proven
treacherous, while the native police and
officials here in Manila are living on a
scale of luxury Â«suspiciously dispropor
tionate to their salaries. Charges against
native Judges for failing to account for
the thousands of dollars received in fines
are under investigation.
At present the governmental alterna
tives rre the army on the one hand and
anarchy on the other. General Otis' plan
of municip.il government is being Inaugu
rated in the principal towns of central
Luzon and in parts of the Visayas; but the
Filipinos persist in thinking that the ques
tion whether the United States will retain
the Philippines is still open, and some
local leader? ask that municipal elections
be postponed until after the Presidential
election.
The future Elate of the church is a
leading question In the minds of many,
although most of those who have talked
with Judge Taft and his colleagues draw
the Inference that the Commissioners are
opposed to the reinstatement of friars.
Archbishop Chapvelle has taken a strong
stand in supporting the request of the
friars to be established in their old
position.
As a result of last week's scouting more
than 200 Filipinos were killed and 160 cap
tured, while 140 rifles, with ammunition
and etores. were seized.
The American loss was nine killed, in
cluding a captain and a lieutenant; two
captains and twenty-one privates wound
ed; and one captain taken prisoner by the
Filipinos.

as to keep the authorities advised of the
feeling among the Chinese.

up the ladder. There in a shelf of the
rocks they found an insurgent camp,
whence a pmall gruard of Filipinos had
scuttled on their approach, leaving all
their personal effects. Hidden ill the for
est was a large building with a roof of
palm lt-aves. so ingeniously constructed
that a stranger might have passed within
a few feet without noticing it. There were
other approaches like the one Funston
discovered, each one accessible only by

public buildings at Malolos, Aguinaldo's
state carriage and the harness of the four
horses which drew it. and all the public
documents up to the date of the evacua
tion of Malojop. filling forty large packing
boxes. Buencamino, the Secretary of
State of the Filipino revolutionary gov
ernment, who is in Manila, says, how
ever, that none of the really important
Â»=Â»>cret papers were found, that among
them was correspondence with foreign
Governments and letters from prominent
anti-imperialists. Including Hon. W. J.
Bryan and Senator Hoar. All of these,
he says, were cent to Hongkong last Sep
tember for safe keeping in the hands of
the Junta. The purport of the letters
from anti-lmperiallPt?, according to ' his
recollection, was that the Filipinos should
adhere to their demands for independence,
and they would eventually be sustained
by the American voters.
DIFFICULTIES BESET THE
.PHILIPPINE COMMISSION
BILOXI, Miss., June 10.â Two negroe9
were lynched and their bodies burned
early this morning at Mississippi City. It
is not absolutely certain that either vic
tim was 'guilty. They were Henry Askew
and Ed Russ, held as suspects. Law
abiding people condemn the lynching.
District Attorney White had promised
that the prisoners would be ' brought to
trial on Monday, and yesterday at a mass
meeting the citizens promised to support
him. Sheriff Ramsay, in order to protect
Askew and Russ from mob violence,
moved them secretly to a bath-house.
After midnight the mob overpowered a
deputy sheriff on guard, dragged the
negroes away, tied them back to back and
swung them up to the same tree. Their
bodies were riddled with bullets, and after
death ensued Â¦were set on tire. The nau
seating smell of burning flesh could be
detected for miles around.
The Sheriff reached the scene after the
execution and saw the members of the
mob, but made no attempt to arrest any
of them.
On June 2 a 13-year-old school-girl was
outraged and murdered about two miles
from Blloxi. Askew and Russ had been
In the vicinity and. were charged with the
crime.

ment at the Hands of

BUTTE, Mont., June 10.â The Hon. Wn- '
liam A. Clark, who resigned his position
as United States Senator for Montana and
who was immediately appointed to the va
cancy by the acting Governor, reached
home this afternoon and was given a tre
mendous ovation. When the train pulled
into the Northern Pacific . depot several
thousand people were waiting, and as the
Senator stepped from the car he was
greeted with cheers. A band of music
had been eng?.?ed. When the Senator had
been almost carried to his carriage the
crowd formed in line and. headed by tne
band, led the procesion up town. It was
an Impromptu affair, but the enthusiasm
made up for the lack of organization. It
is estimated 4000 men of all classesâmer
chants, miners, workingrmen and profes
sional men â made the Ions march from
the depot to the Senator's home, while
many times that number lined the streets
along the route and added their cheers
to those of the marchers. Arriving at his
home, which had been handsomely dec
orated, the Senator managed to make his
way through the press of people to the
veranda, where he addressed tne crowd.
Among other things he said:
"I was elected by the representatives of
this State as their free choice 'for the po
sition of United States Senator. Ever
since that I have been harassed by the
most devilish persecution that man has
ever been subjected to. It was my in
tention to devote my time and labor to
thifi work. There came to Washington,
however, a gang of perjurers, who dissem
inated their vile falsehoods, and found a
committee that was willing- to listen to
them and spread their perjuries to the
world. I was not allowed in many cases
to Introduce evidence to refute these
charges.' . v.i'
Mr. Clark gave individual instances of
this. Continuing, he said:
"When this man Chandler had bulldozed
the committee Into reporting against me,
after consultation with my friends I with
drew from the Senate. At that time there
happened to be a man In Helena at the
head of the State Â¦government -who 'was
fearless and had the courage to do what
was right. I did not know whom he
would appoint, but I knew it would be
some one who would be a credit to the
State, and not one of this gang of cut
throats. There is no question of the va
lidity of that appointment."
He said he had not tried to take hi*
seat under that appointment because he
understood some or the members of the
Committee on Privleges and Elections in

Interesting Figures in the
Annual Financial
Statement

Giving rull Details of Agni-
naido's Plan for the TJp

Correrjjoni5cr.ee of Associated I'resÂ«.
MANILA. May 15.â The Filipinos are
addicted to the habii of documentation
and the preservation of their records, no
matter how unimportant. Down in Aibay
Province our troops recently found ihe
yearly financial statement of the rebel
government. " While it is probable its
ilgurcs are untrue, it is interesting a> an
example jf how the rebels do business
and maintain their prestige among their
people. . . .
The average Filipino is credulous to a
rc.niaxka.ble decree- He believes that
Aeuiaa2do'Â« body sheds btillets like a roof
does hall and that he -kills bis enemies
by spilling nre at them.
In their balance slutt for 1859-1900 the
insurgent Minister cf Finance suites that
during the years 1SV6-97 the expenses of
the Spanish government in administering
affairs amounted to $17,474,O2'J (Mexican),
but. thanks to the capacity of the revolu
tionary leaders, the total exix?nditures of
thÂ« insurgent government for last year
only amounted to $6.:Â»42.4j7. All this econ
omy was effected while the Manila custom
house, a. most lucrative source of in
come, was in the hands of. the Americans.
It was promised that as soon as the rebels
gained possession of Manila, which would
be in a few weeks, they could manifestly
reduce the rate of taxation. In the mean
time money was needed, and it was in
cumbent on all good patriots to pay all
the tax-collectors, ask of them. With a
lew words describing Aguinaldo's glory
and invulnerability, and the good times
cominer to everybody when the Americans
were linaJiy driven from the islands, the
Minister ot Finance accounts for his in
come as follows:
Income isll in Mexican currency) â
Ordinary indirect taxes $432.050 00'
Ordinary direct tax*Â» 1.OW.757 00
Special taxes kC.600 OU
txtraordinary contribution* 4,lM>.uoO iw
Total SG.S42.4UT 00
The it^m of "extraordinary contribu
tior.s" covers the multitude of stealings
and forced payments not included in tne
other sources of income.
The expenditures arc accounted for as !

The statement shows a deficit of some j
$2**i. j
The insurgent government undoubtedly
handled considerable money last year, but '
whether they collected $6.009.<*Â«J Mexican j
is not known to outsiders. Their expenses ,
have been specially heavy in the matter |
of nrnip. Filibusters and others have made :

Assassination Planned.
The KTeat store of Insurgent documents
discovered by General Kuninton, together,
with some interesting papers which Cap
tain Smith found In the pos.:<ession of Gen
oral Pantaleon Garcia, throw int;ies-iing
Fide lights upon the Kilijjlno government.
MoÂ»*t iiniÂ»ortant of the lot is Agruinaldo's :
plan for the uprising in Manila, which
was drawn by him at Malolos in his own ;
hajid writing, in the Tagalog language,
and bears date January Â». 1SS;*. Pinned to '
the document was a. translation Into-Span
ish, done in the hand of Buencamino.
Agulnaldo'p order was addressed to his
'â¢valiant Sandatlhani*," or bolomen. When
the word for the uprising was given they
were to slay all American soldiers in Ma
nila, The inhabitants were to repair to
the hou5e top*, whence they were to hurl
down upon the soldiers heavy furniture
and any iron implements they might
have, heated redhol. They were a!?o to
have ready in their hous#s hot water
which was to be thrown upon passing sol- !
dier*. or squirted at them from bamboo
f-Trinpet*. The women and children were
exhorted to help in preparing the water
and boiling oil, which they were to paKs
out to the men for use. Afterward the
bnlotnen were to run through the streets*,
slashing Americans wherever they met
them, They wore instructed not to stop
to pick up the guns of soldiers they killed;
those could be collected afterward. The
bolomen were warned to restrain them- i
selves from the temptation of looting, be
cause, as Aguinaldo explained, he was
particularly desirous to make good in the
eyes of foreign nations his* assertions that
the Filipinos wore a disciplined and civil- j
â¢zed people. Particular injunctions were
jrivrn for protecting the bank?, even the
Spanish bank.
.Other interesting papers related to tho !
purchase and importation of arm?. One i
letter concerning a consignment of j
Mausers stated that the German Govern
ment would not allow them to be shipped
from the country without a payment of
$10 on each gun. Filibustering must have
been a costly enterprise to the revolu
tionary government It appears that- one
cargo consisting of &w ritien and 503,000
reund? of ammunition con $1*7.000 Mexi
can money l>efore it reached the insur
gents.
Among the items Included in the bill
of the gentlemen who engineered the deal
was one of $4OW for hotel bills in Hong
kong and throe other expenditures of sev
eral thousand explained as "squeeze,"
which Is Interpreted aÂ» l<rib*>f> to officials
to keep their eyes closed. The filibuster i
was a man whose name has frequently
ligtire<i in the papers in .connection with
this business, while other letters indicate
that an American Consul at a Chinese
port sold s*Â»vÂ«Tal shipments of arms to |
Aguinaldo. In a letter from Howard Bray, i
nn Englishman belonging to the Hong
kong Junta, Aguinaldo is warned that
Kpencer Prutt. the American Consul at
Singapore, is "a d â d traitor." Aguinaldo's ,
letter book contain? copies of letters to i
s:ll sorts of people. One to the Emperor
of Japan accompanied a gift of a sword, I
which was Â«ent as a token of apprecia
tion of the â¢â¢kindness" shown by the Jap- '
anese Government to the Filipinos, the i
nature of the klndnesj being unexplained.
Prominent Men Implicated.
.These documents the authorities are
rending to thÂ«- War Department and they
nre reticent ubout the contents. The pub- '
Uralion in the Manila papers that letters
wore found implicating prominent business '
lirtns in the city is said by the gossips at
the English Hub to have brought great
uneasiness to sundry guilty consciences I
There has long been a suspicion here that
tot insurgents would not have been able
to maintain communication with and col
lect taxes from the outlying islands with
out the connivance of some of the big
shipping or commercial houses. Records
of contributions by Manila firms to the
insurrection appear, but these are not
surprising, because foreigners in Manila
considered It cccessary to make such con
tributions by way of insurance upon their
properties in the provinces.
The storage of these documents gives
a good illustration of Filipino Ingenuity.
General Kunslon with eighteen troopers
was making a reconnoissancesome twenty
miles from Cabanatuan. along the Klo
Grar.de de Pampagrna, hoping to get on
the track of Pantaleon Garcia or Pio del

Wound on Louis Peterson's Head
fchat Lent Mystery to
His Death.
Early yesterday morning Louis Peterson,
a longshoreman who resides at 19A Gil
bert street, died from a fractured skull
in Jestin Tarrevellier's saloon, 368 Third
street. He was carried Into the place
from the sidewalk, where he was found
lying with a wound under one eyebrow
and another behind his ear. \
The police were notified, and they
learned that Peterson had been very
drunk and had visited the saloon in com
pany with several other men. The sus
picion that he had met with foul play
caused the officers to take into- custody
four of his companions â J. P. Drynan.
730'yfc Harrison street; Henry Cleary. 1303
Sanchez; Richard Obertson, 108 Berry, and
George J. Lowe, bartender at Tarrevel
lier's place.
These men explained that the deceased
had gone outside and fallen down. There
was a box containing a palm tree where
he fell and the men said that Peterson's
head must have struck on this.
Detective Dinan, who was detailed on
the case, became convinced of the truth
of the story told, and yesterday after
noon Captain Seymour ordered the release
of the prisoners. The only element of
mystery about the case is the wound on
the side of the head. It is thought this
may have been Inflicted by the curb. An
autopsy to-day will set at rest the doubt
on this point. :
POLICE THOUGHT MURDER
HAD BEEN COMMITTED
The Windsor Park Is consigned to J. J
Moore & Co. She left Newcastle with 2000
tons of coal aboard and comes Into port
with 1200 tons. She does not fhow any
signs of the experience she has gone
through, except that she is high out of
the water for a coal-laden ship.
"For eight days and eight nights we
worked among that coal. As soon as one
shift would finish its spell the men would
be out of the hold in an instant and would
rush forward to get a breath of cool air.
Down in the hold It was like a furnace,
while on deck the thermometer stood 93
degrees in the shade. The donkey engine
kept up Its monotonous clank, clank, all
through the twenty-four hours, playing
a sort of diabolical accompaniment to the
rattle of the shovels used without inter
mission in the hold below. Basketful
after basketful of the black diamonds
went over the side, until we had Jetti
soned SOO tons, and then Captain Lambie
gave u* the signal to stop. All danger
was past, so the boats were swung !n
again and everything made snug, after
which we took turn about to get a little
sleep. I don't want any more heated coal
in mine. That one experience will last
mÂ«> n. lifetime." <"
my life." said Chief Officer William A.
Adams yesterday. "For eight days . we
worked as men never worked before,
knowing that if we failed a lingering
death in open boats was before us. As
soon as the heating- of the coal was dis
covered Captain Lamble ordered the boats
provisioned and swung out. Then all
hands set to work to save the ship and
ourselves at the same time. We were in
latitude 19 degrees south, longitude 163
decrees west, when the danger was first
discovered, and had reached latitude 11
degrees south, longitude 159 degrees west
when we b^gan throwing the coal over
board. All hands except the captain took
turns at shoveling- the coal into the bask
ets, and the 'old man* was not idle, as it
kept him busy supplying the boiler of the
donkey engine with water.
THE captain and crew of the British
ship Windsor Park will not soon
forget the voyage just completed
from Australia. After weathering
a cyclone, during which the vessel was
In hard straits, all hands were called
upon to fight death face to face for right
cays. At times the case looked depur
ate, but in the end the men won, and
the Windsor Park made port minus S00
toes cf her cargo.
The Windsor Park Is an old East India
clipper and in her time was one of the
finest vessels of her class afloat. This is
her first visit to San Francisco as a col-
!!er, and Captain George Lambie says he
never wants to see another cargo of black
diamonds under her hatches again as long
as he commands the stout old ship.
The Windsor Park left Newcastle. N.
S. \\\. on February 26. for San Francisco.
with a cargo of 2S>X< tons of coal. Fine
weather v.as experienced for a month und
good progress was made. On March 27 it
began to blow and the gale gradually in
creased until everything had to be
snugged down. The mizzen topsail and
crossjack were blown out of the bolt
ropes.
On March 28 the wind was blowing with
cyclonic force and there was a heavy,
confused sea that constantiv broke
aboard, flooding the decks and making
the ship labor heavily. Two ports on the
port side were washed away and every
thing 1 movable on deck went overboard,
while the fore and main topsails were
blown away. Then came the experience
that made every man aboard think his
last hour had come.
"Early on the morning of March 23
the storm moderated." says Captain Lam
bie, "and as eoon as possible I got the
hatches off and took the temperature of
the coal. I found It was M degrees and
Increasing. I did everything possible to
ventilate the cargo and reduce the tem
perature, but failed. On April 9 the tem
perature in the after hatch had Increased
to 116 degrees and that in the main hatch'
was 1CS degrees. The coal was so hot that
the men could barely touch It. Expecting
every moment to see the coal break out
Into a large blaze I set the men to
work Jettisoning th"e stuff. Only three
mer. could work at a time, and they only
for a spell of ten minutes. For eight
days and nights we toiled, and during
that time threw overboard SO) tons of coal.
The temperature In the hold was then
down to the normal, so I gave all hands
a well-earned rest. From that time on
our voyage to San Francisco was un
eventful."
"It was the closest call I ever had In
Hoisting Smoldering Coal Out of the Ship's Hold.
This tearful story proved to be false
when the letter expressing the prisoner's
intentions was found in his pocket. In
stead of having been on the defensive,
he proves to have bÂ«en the aggressor and
to have tracked the m<nT now dying on
a cot In the hospital, since he wrote thd
lines. Miss Zipfel stated last night that
nhe did not even know Petrovich and re
members of no time when she Â¦was in
sulted. The trouble either started, ovÂ»r
the restaurant debt or over a misdirected
blow while the two men were jesting.
Letter Proved Story False.
Opusich says he and the younir woman
came here from Dalmatla about five years
ago. Their friendship ripened into love,
and Miss Zipfel promised to become his
wife. Then, he says. "Napoleon" appeared
on the scene, and. becoming infatuated
with his sweetheart, threatened him; that
he fired only to save himself. The in
jured man had no weapons of any sort on
his person.
Opusich wept bitterly at the conclusion
of his version of the trouble, and as he
seemed to be on the verge of collapsing
he was placed in a cell and a watch
placed ovpr him. In one of his pockets
was found a photograph of the woman
over whom the shooting occurred.
placed me under arrest. I am sorry that
It happened, but I was rorced to shoot
him. a3 I considered that my life waa in
danger."
AFTER harboring murder in his
heart for nearly two weeks becausa
he had received a wound that
would scar him for life \ Â»Â«^o upa
sich, a youthful Slavonian fruit packer,
wrought his revenge by firing two bullets
Into the brain of John Petrovich, a waiter,
known as "Napoleon," at the corner of
Pacific and Stockton streets last evening.
Betrovich died at 3 o'clock this morning
at the Harbor Hospital.
The crime, as revealed by a not the
murderer wrote some time ago. was
of a most desperate and premeditated
character. It was committed under the
eyes of three policemen and so determined
did Opusich seem to slay his man that
he followed him across the street after
wounding him fatally, firing four shots
as he went.
At the point where the shooting oc
curred Opusich had lain in wait for his
victim and the first shot was fired from
behind, the bullet entering the back of
Petrovich's head. The fifth shot in the
revolver was probably, reserved for lUs
own brain, but Officer A. M. Cayot was
too quick for him and wrested the weapon
from him before he had another chance
to use It.
From what can be learned eff the affair
the trouble started some time ago. Opu
sich says it was because of an Insult to
u woman. Ah*?- .vm-i'.i 'Ziplet. wno re
sides at 1409 Mason street, but this is dis
puted by the lady herself. The employer
of Petrovich claims that the shooter oweu
him money and this precipitated hostili
ties and Petrovich himself stated that the
whole difficulty arose out of a blow de
livered in a spirit of fun.
Two weeks ago Opusich was wounded In
the head by Petrovich. The latter struck
him with a heavy pitcher, cutting a gash
across his forehead that required six
stitches to close. This occurred on May
30 and the following day the Injured man.
angered at the thought that he shouM
have to carry a scar to his grave, wrtrte
this letter, which was found in his room
last night:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 31.
I am coing to commit suicide to-morrow
morning, and if I get a chance to kill Napo
leon 1*1! do it. If not I will kill myself any
way, because I am cut. forever on my forehead
and I cannot stand it. It seems to me some
thing shameful and that is the thing I die for.
Good-by, all friends; good-by forever.
VIDO OPUSICH.
On Petrovich-s Trail.
But Opusich did not kill himself on the
following day. Tic evidently reconsidered
his decision and resolved to first slay the
man who scarred him. Since that time
he has dogged his would-be victim from
place to place, waiting for the opportunity
to commit the crime. Yesterday after
noon he visited several places and in
quired for Petrovich, and- finally located
him in the Dalmatian Saloon, at the corner
pf Stockton and Pacific streets, partially
intoxicated.
The man bent on murder simply put nls
head inside the door and, jumping bacK
to the sidewalk, waited for Petrovich to
come out. In his hand he grasped a 38
callber Smith & Wesson revolver that he
had purchased -at a Kearny-street store
for his fell purpose. In a few minutes the
waiter appeared and scarecly had he
stepped on the sidewalk â¢ when the first
shot rang out.
Petrovich wounded, started to run
across the street, but the man with mur
der In his heart followed close, firing two
shots as he reached the middle of the
streetand one on the opposite corner, the
last bringing his victim to the ground.
Then the police grabbed Opusich and dis
armed him.
Officers A. M. Cayot. James Connolly
and Sergeant "Scotty" Campbell, were all
standing but a few yards away when the
shooting commenced. The two patrolmen
were on blockade duty on Pacific street
and Sergeant Campbell was standing on
Stockton street. Cayot was the first to
reach the man and grab the pistol. All
the officers in rushing upon the excited
assassin were directly in the line. of fire
and it is a miracle that some of them
were not struck by the two bullets that
missed Petrovich.
The wounded man had been struck
twice, both bullets passing through the
back part of his hat and entering his
head. One drove in at the base of the
brain and lodged. in his throat, and the
other penetrated the brain. He was hur
ried to the Harbor Receiving Hospital In
an unconscious condition and was treated
by. Dr. Robinson. He cannot survive. The
injured man was employed as a waiter, in
a restaurant at the corner of Sacramento
and Leidesdorff streets and was 45 years
of age.
Opusich. who is only 20 years old, pre
sented a sorry spectacle as he was being
led -from the patrol wagon to the City
Prison. With tears streaming down his
face he stood before the desk sergeant
and tremblingly - answered the questions
put to him.
"I was forced to shoot him, he pitifully
remarked; "he was determined to kill

FACE TO FACE WITH DEATH
FOR EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS
The Market Street Company has never
lost Its franchise on Bush and Sansome
streets, where srngle tracks were laid
years ago and horsecars at one time ope
rated. Last year it succeeded in getting
an ordinance through the Board of Su
pervisors giving it permission to erect
poles and string electric wires, but
Mayor Phelan vetoed it.
Under the so-called- "corkscrew fran
chise" the Market Street Company sought
to secure permission to run electric cars
from Market street north on Grant avo
nue to Geary, thence east to Kearny,
north to Bush and east again on Bush to
Sansome, connecting with other crosstown
roads and a line on Jackson to the water
front. After a hard fight before the Su
pervisors the battle for this franchise was
lost, although the Post and Montgomery
street line went through.
Thus far cars have only been run on
the new line from Kearny and Bush
streets to Sansome and Jackson and re
turn, transfers being issued.
â¢ It is now believed that the Market-street
Company will attempt to carry out its
original plan to lay sharp curves at
Kearny and Bush, Kearny and
Post and Jackson and Sansome
streets. The Post-street cars will
then be run north on Montgomery street,
over the single track, to Jackson, on Jack
son to Sansome. south on Sansome to
Bush, west to Kearny. south to Post and
then west on Post over the double tracks.
This will mean dangerous curves at Bush
and Post streets, where they Intersect
Kearny.
The Market-street Railway Company
executcd a clever coup yosterday by
siringlr.g wires and running cars over the
old tracks on Bush street, , between
Kearny and Sansome streets- 'and along
Sansome to Jackson. A year ago they
were refused permission by the Supervis
ors to erect poles and string electric wires
ever this route. This refusal was ac
counted one of the victories of the people
in the big fight against the so-called "cork
screw franchise." But the railroad com
pany has, as usual, had its way and the
cajs were running all day yesterday
without interruption from any source.
What the Market-street Company failed
to secure legally was done by strategy.
For several months agents of the com
pany have been working quietly to secure
the permission of property owners along
the route to attach guy wires to build
ings. So quietly was this done that no
inkling of their plans leaked out. All
being in readiness, the advantage given
by a quiet Sunday morning was taken to
complete the work. A large force of line
men was put to work about 7 o'clock and
in two hours' time they had strung the
wires and guyed them securely . to the
buildings along tfa^ route. By 10 o'clock
the electric current had been turned on
and two carstput on the line. Almost be
fore people along the route knew what
was going on the cars were running on
schedule time, transferring passengers at
Kearny and Jackson and accepting trans
fers at both ends of the line.

Paris Exposition the enthusiasm of the great audience
of Americans that gathered to hear it did not break all
bounds until the "Cake Walk" and other ragtime
pieces were played. Then the American colony be
came delirious. It danced and whooped and de r
n-anded encores until the band was exhausted. That
is bad, but not so bad as was feared. For a long time
there was a dread in this country that the American
Commissioners and their staff at Paris would array
themselves in militia uniforms and open the Ameri

Democracy, but drawing the platform to suit the con
servatives. The Senator, it is said, will go at once to
Chicago for the purpose of conferring with Bryan
snd will urge him "not to abandon the Chicago plat
form, nor any principle contained in it, nor to stul
tify himself, nor to do anything contrary to the rules
c f good faith, sincerity and self-respect; but to con
sent that the reafnrmation of the Chicago platform be
ftut in language which will not alarm the country and
will permit the Democratic party to reunite and win."
In that programme there is all the unctuousness of
a professional hypocrite. Bryan, we are told, is to be
asked to do nothing contrary to good faith and self
respect, but he is asked to consent to the expression,
cf his doctrines in language quite different from that
in which he has been expressing them for the last four
years. The object of the change of words, we are
frankly told, is to prevent the doctrines from alarm
ing this year those who were alarmed by them in
1S96. Are the conservative Democrats, then, such
stupid folk that they can be beguiled into supporting
t'ne Chicago platform by the mere process of covering
it with a Kansas City canvas?
If the reafnrmation of the old platform in new
words do not change the intent of the platform itself,
then every man who is induced to vote for it by rea
son of the change of words will have been defrauded
and cheated. If, on the other hand, the change of

PERSONAL MENTION.
THjE COMMERCIAL SITUATION.
THE feature of trade last week was the upward
turn in wheat. This important product, which has
so long languished, started up under the influence
01 adverse crop reports and rose about 5 cents per
bushel at Chicago in a couple of days. This market re
sponded and the close of the week found wheat a
much better piece of property than it has been for
some time, with increasing speculation. The minor
grains sympathized and the feeling was firmer all
ilong the line of mill and feed stuffs. The cause of
the rise is the poor outlook east of the Misissippi and
the precarious condition of the crop in the great
Northwest, where rain is badly needed. In Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana and Michigan the ravages of the
Hessian fly have cut down the acreage 33 per cent and
the crop itself over 50 per cent, in some cases destroy
ing it altogether. In addition the outlook in foreign
countries is not sufficiently flattering to counteract the
adverse reports from the United States, hence the ad-

petroleum, siik, hemp, a flat market for boots and

Manufacturers are giving way before the accumula
tion of stock and backwardness of buj-ers and more
mills are reported shutting down. All this is goin^j
on without any loss in confidence or any disturbance
in the money market, which is as abundantly supplied
Â£S ever. Indeed, the decreased activity in trade and
dosing down of mills throughout the country has
caused a stream of idle money to flow into New York,
where it is slowly accumulating and going into hiber

Under these conditions Wall street remains duIL

amateurs than profesrionls, who regard it with a
skeptical and indifferent eye. But it makes the public

The decrease in the volume of business last week,
as shown by the bank clearings of eighty cities, was
8.6 per cent. The decrease at New York was 14.S
per cent and at Boston 18.6 per cent. St. Louis, dis
turbed by a serious strike, showed a gain of 1.6 per
cent â an incongruity. Pittsburg, the scat of the iron

Tf-|E SCHOOL BOARD PROGRAMME.
SHOULD the report prove to be true that the
Board of Education intends to adopt rules re
quiring every principal controlling less than
ten classes to teach a class and fixing the minimum
numberyof pupils in a class at sixty-five, then it is time
for the- parents of school children, for the press and
for ttfe public generally to make protest. Such a
scheme cannot be made commendablcÂ»even if given
the respectable name of economy. It is essentially
bad and no matter in what guise it may be masked
no cood can come of it.
The Call had occasion some time ago to point out
the wrong which is bting done to the public by the
practice of various boards and commissions of the
city government in holding secret sessions for the dis
cussion of municipal affairs under their control. A
striking evidence of the evil results of that practice
is presented in this case. The reported intention of
the Board of Education to make the stated changes
in the rules is a rumor merely. The agreement to
make the change is said to have been effected at ex
ecutive meetings. The public has known nothing of
it, has had no chance to discuss it, no opportunity to
protest and yet it is announced, the board will prob
ably carry out the scheme at the meeting to be held
to-day.
Were the proposed changes unobjectionable in
themselves, there would still be just cause for com
plaint on the part of the public in the very fact that
they have been devised by the board, not in open
discussion but in the secrecy of executive sessions,
and are to be sprung upon the people as a surprise.
There is no authority for the Board of Education to
carry on public business in that way. The Police
Commission is the only commission or board to
which the charter gives the privilege of secrecy. All
other administrative bodies of the municipality arc
expected to act openly and above board, so that the
press may publish and the people may read what is
going on and what plans of administration Â«ire being
considered.
Had it been generally known that the Board of
Education had under consideration any such scheme
as the one rumored, there would have been vigorous
protests before now. It is not right to require the
principal of a school to devote a large part of his
time to teaching a class. The rule might as well re
quire each member of the board to teach a class and
the president to teach two classes. Neither is it right
tc fix the minimum number of pupils in a class at
sixty-five. That number is in excess of what a
teacher can rightly attend to. All experience in pub
lic and in private schools has demonstrated that a
teacher cannot manage and instruct so large a num
ber of pupils with anything like the efficiency that
parents have a right to expect.
It is asserted furthermore by competent authorities
that the average classrooms in our school buildings
arc not spacious enough to accommodate so large a
number of pupils; that to enforce the rule would be
to overcrowd the rooms, producing not only incon
venience but conditions prejudicial to health.
Economy in the administration of the public schools
is a popular desire; we may even add that it is im
peratively demanded â but the desire and the demand
are for economics that will put an end to waste, ex
travagance, jobbery and corruption, such as have
been too frequently manifest for many a year past.
There is no demand for an economy or a parsimony
that will weaken the teaching force or impair the ef
ficiency of the instruction. The people are perfectly
willing to pay all that is needed for the proper teach
ing of the children of the city. They object only to
that which is the result of negligence, unfaithfulness
or dishonesty â and to star chamber proceedings.
Vlckers Sons and Maxim at Barrow em
piny about 10,000 men in the trades con
nected with shipbuilding, engine construc
tion and gun and armor making. '
Brazil has five naval arsenals, that at
Rio Janeiro being the prnlcipal. The
others are located at Pernambuco, Bahla,
Ladarlo and Itaque. The last named is
on the upper Uruguay and 13 used for
river flotilla.
The Neptune and Inflexible, battleships
in the British navy, are to be overhauled
nt an estimated expense of 1125,000. The
Neptune has never been of any account
since her purchase in 1S7S, and, like the
late Bellelsle, Is only fit for gun practice
to be sunk.
The damage to the Japanese battleship
Asahl, which ran aground last month near
Portsmouth, is quite serious. AVhen
docked it was found that the steel plates
had buckled under the fore barbette
twenty feet on the starboard and forty
feet on the port sldft and that nearly all
the frames through this distance were
broken. The ship will be detained at least
two months to undergo the necessary re
pairs.
The new fuel for the. British torpedo
boats Is of two kinds, one being 1 composed
of Welsh coal residuum, the other being
a mixture of anthracite coal and other
composites, formed in blocks of twenty
two pounds each. Trials of these fuels
are to be made as follows:. Four hour3 at
full speed, natural draught: twelve hours
at twelve knots; twenty-four hours at
ten knots, and a harbor trial of seven
hours.
The NewskI shipbuilding yard at St. i
Petersburg is In a bad way. Its balance j
of last year's account showed a deficit of
1,113,069 rubles, which, with prior years,
makes a total deficit of 5.547.347, rubles.
The original capital paid up was 7,500.000
rubles and obligations to the amount of
3,503,000 rubles have been contracted. The
yard was established with a view of tak
ing contracts for the navy, but the work
has either been insufficient or badly
managed. The Russian Imperial Bank la
the principal stockholder.
Chief Constructor Yates of the Ports
mouth dockyard recently delivered a lec
ture in which he prophesied that battle
ships would be obsolete twenty years
hence. By that time there would prob
ably be three distinct types of vessels,
one for firing guns, a second to discharge
torpedoesâ both of a nich types would be
heavily armored. The third would be to
ram disabled ships and send them to the
bottom. He argued that these three com
binations could not be successfully carried
out In one single ship as It was now at
tempted in the present type of battleship
and that If a ship had only one function
to perform each man would know exactly
what to do in battle.
Torpedo craf t-of all descriptions have,
as a whole, proved more dangerous to
their own crews than to their adversaries.
Explosions of boilers have occurred with
in the last two months on French. Turk-,
lsh and Russian torpedo boat destroyers,
involving loss of life. Numerous mishaps
occur to British craft of this class, no less
than three being disabled In one day last
month, the victims being the Ariel. Avon
and Porcupine, damaged in collision or
by propellers being disabled. Torpedo
boat No. S5 was severely damaged an-1
nearly sunk while on practice, a torpedo
flred from another boat striking No. 83.
The Brazilian system of court-martials
and procedure of naval and military law
have some good features. Ordinary court
martials are composed of seven members,
one of whom is a civil magistrate who
acts as reporter to the court and has a
deliberative voice. The High Court of
Military Justice is a permanent Council
of Revision and Is composed of fifteen
life members, of whom eight are army of-
Ilcers, four naval officers and three civil
magistrates. The advantage of having
civilians on the court who are learned in
the law is obvious. It Is no Infrequent
occurrence that sentences in our naval
service are set aside by the Secretary of
the Navy, who, as a lawyer, finds that
the proceedings were either irregular or
the punishment did not lit the crime.
The British Admiralty has furnished
Parliament with the detailed cost of re
pairs to boilers of certain new ships In the
navy, from which the following data are
taken:

The gangplank was pulled In at noon
on a Wednesday In April at the New York
dock, and for the first two days out no
Incident occurred worth relating. On the
morning of the third day some half-dozen
passengers reported to the captain that
they had been mysteriously robbed of
large quantities of Jewelry and diamonds.
No report of this was allowed to reach
the remainder of the passengers or crew
for Beveral day?, when the robberies* Â¦were
repeated and the story became public
property on board. The voyage lasted
tight and a half daysâ nine nightsâ and
In that time over thirty staterooms were
entered, trunks opened. Jewel caskets
emptied and strong boxes looted. In
every cane the losers were among the
wealthiest people on the passenger list.
One Chicago woman lost over 13000 worth
of diamonds and pear!s. while a young
married couple from New York were
losers to the extent of over W00O In gems.
A clothing dealer In Kansas City who re

erty. Mrs. George F. Washburn of Bos
ton parted with a diamond crescent and
pearl necklace valued at $3300. Miss Mae
E. George of New York lost a tiara valued
at J1200. The losses foot up In the neigh
borhood of $45,000.
Every effort was made to discover the
perpetrator of these wholesale robberies.
The closest watch was kept, detectives
on board were called Into service, but

AN ostrich, $45,000 worth of missing
Jewels and a quartet of thieves fig
ure in a remarkable story from
Paris, published In the Chicago In
ter-Ocean.
Among the chief attractions of the Cali
fornia exhibit at tho French Exposition was
to have been an educated ostrich, raised
and trained on a California ranch. This
was thu way It whh ect forth in the ofn
elal rntnineru*. Tho ostrich was shipped
without avail. Search of several state
rooms and no less than twenty-five pas
sengers failed to bring any of the stolen
property to Hsht. As soon as the steamer
was landed the police of Cherbourg were
enlisted and the. Parts Â«letectr<re tares no
tified.
For days the detectives worked without
obtaining a clew. Then attention wai
called to the fact that Commissioner PetVc
was waiting In vain for an educated Cali
fornia ostrich. The police turned their
notice temporarily from the missing jew
els to the lost ostrich. The disembowelci
body of the bird was found finally In a
lonrly suburb of Cherbourg. anÂ«l near by
were a few broken bits of what had beeri
expensive, jewelry. There were not many
pieces of 'jewelry, but enough to set the
astute minds of the detectives to work.
They have now found out something
which convinces them, so they say. that
the four passengers In charge of the os
trich were four of the most expert dia
mond thieves !n the United States. Thes*
thieves discovered that preparations bad
been made to ship an ostrich to the Elx
position and either secured possession of
the real bird which was to hare been sent,
or anticipated the plans of the California
Commission, and started with an ostrich
of their own choosing. At any rate, when
the attendants went down to the hold
every day to fted the ostrich they dinea
him on choice gems, which the older man
and the pretty girl, who passed for hta
daughter, had stolen from tne> cabin
passengers the night before. At thj end
of the voyage they took the ostrich out
to the edpe of Cherbourg, killed It and
recovered the most of the Jewelry. They
had ample time to escape before tneir
scheme â¢was suspected.

THE \ PASSING Of THE} BOERS.
HISTORY records no more pitiful tragedy than
has . been enacted in South Africa. Nor
docs history record a more amazing spectacle
than the wild rejoicing in Great Britain that a victory
has been gained by that empire over two weak re
publics. The British force outnumbered the Boer
army more than twelve to one. Yet London went
! mad over the victory! If the record of human affairs
has been correctly written such rejoicing over such a
victory is a symptom of national decay. It indicates
the breaking down of that fine spirit which refused to
count anything a victory at .' arms worth re
cording that was not won from an equal foe
and none worthy of great" exultation that was
not gained over a superior force. When that
spirit goes out of a people and victories over
} freemen, outnumbered and friendless in the world, are
hailed with shrieks and freaks of rejoicing, it is a sign
that the equal foe may come and conquer those who
vaunt their victory over the weak.
There is much that is suggestive in the fate of the
two republics. The world has looked on with indif
ference while monarchy, greed and commercialism
have besomed them off the map. The monarchies
which normally have scores to settle 'with Great
Britain refrained from taking her in straits and seek
ing an accounting. They are interested in a reaction
against republican institutions. They are admonished
by the fate of France,-- which in our American revolu
tion aided a republic against a monarchy, only to find
the ferment of freedom extended to her own institu
tions and in a measure to every nation on the con
tinent. A monarchy cannot well aid republican in
stitutions abroad and deny them at home, so Europe
has waited until England brought down her prey and
if there is to be an accounting it must wait until she
ha? gorged herself with it. Belgium, Italy, Portugal,
Germany, all states ruled by a monarch, have posses
sions in Africa. They cannot afford to perpetuate
the existence there of two republics. Therefore, while
they owe England no good will, they avtrt their faces
while she assassinates liberty.
Africa is the only continent left upon which the
civilized races can get a foothold and where civil in
stitutions are to be founded. The downfall of the
Free State and Transvaal is final notice served upon
mankind that no republic will be permitted in Africa.
There freedom must have no altars, liberty no wor
shipers, self-government no resting place. The pray
ers of the weak are unanswered. The free-born Boers
can go no farther into the wilderness. The long trek
is over. In the Dark Continent freedom has made its
last stand and received the devotion of its last martyr.
Women mourn their dead. The orders of Rob
erts have burned their farmsteads and put weltering
ruin where kine grazed and fields ripened in the sun.
But this is forgotten while mothers look upon their
fatherless young, captive to the hated Government
that has followed them, like a wolf, from the Cape to
the Vaal.
England has before this given mankind some rea
son to fear her, but she has not before filed such a
claim to the hatred of a world which sometimes likes
fair play. That world may not be just nowjn a mood
to mind what has been done on the Vaal and wildly
celebrated on the Thames. The passion of greed may
have to give place to satiety. But when the appetites
are jaded the conscience renews its vigor. Even
Solomon did not write "All is vanity" until age and
decrepitude had made passion vain. But when con
science takes the throne and the crimes and offenses,
the meannesses, the murders, done in the name of
God's will, and the robberies committed to advance
civilization, are all written off the journal and trans
ferred to each nation's ledger account, this crime in
South Africa will be found to leave England with a
kirger balance to settle than any other nation.
The seeds of retribution are planted along the path
way of an empire which rejoices when it overcomes
the weak. They spring up in time and the mighty
are laid low. Rome got her first fatal blow at the hands
of Hermann. Orphaned by her legions in ravaging
Germany, the child was carried to Rome as the hunter
t2kcs home a strange cub whose dam he has slain
for defending her young. But the German child
never forgot the scenes of his infancy nor forgave
the power that tore him from them. He paid the
score at Teutoburgerwald and in slaughtering the le
grons of Varus to feed German buzzards balanced ac
counts and gave the mortal blow that led to the death
of the empire.
The Boers have been bereaved of their generals by
death and the fortunes of war. One is an exile on St.
Helena, the great and cowardly empire fearing the
imprisoned lion in a place less secure than one with
an unbroken horizon of water. Another is dead,
gone beyond the spites and fears, the quaking greed
and jackdaw hypocrisy, which join in robbery and
sanctify it with prayer and professions for the eleva
tion of man.
But perhaps some Boer lad, whose father's bones
have been stripped by hyenas, and whose childish
face had been baptized in his mother's tears, will re
member it all as he goes forward to manhood and
when the great empire' that lives in denying the right
to live to others and kittens on the substance of the
weak seems at the height of power, insolent and de
fiant, he will direct a blow that inflicts a mortal wound
and the long forgotten dust of the martyrs who fell
for the two republics will thrill in its uncoffined quiet
and the great crime will be avenged.
language carry with it a change of meaning, then
every man who votes for it under the supposition that
the old platform has been reaffirmed will be defrauded.
Either the silver men or the gold men are to be
cheated by the tactics proposed, and yet it is stated
Bryan will not be asked to stultify himself or to do
anything contrary to the rules of good faith, sincerity
and;' self-respect
Fortunately it is not possible for the schemers to
carry out the game of false pretenses they have de
vised. Bryan is too loose 1 of tongue to play the
game, and too headstrong to sit silent and permit
Hill, Gorman and Jones to play it for him. He de
lights in talking and in all his talking his chief delight
has been to pose as the champion of silver. No mat
ter how skillfully the Kansas City platform might be
drawn to catch gudgeons, Bryan would within a week
after the hook was baited make such a racket on the
stump as would frighten away the last one of them.
The surprising feature of the programme is not its
transparent hypocrisy, or the evident belief of the
schemers that Bryan can stand upon any other plat
form than that of Bryanism, but the assumption that
the country was alarmed in 1896 more by the Chi
cago platform than by the Chicago nominee. It is not
too much to say that to the conservative sentiment
and business interests of the people Bryan is fully as
objectionable as the platform on which he stands.
Such a man clothed with the powers of the Presidency
would keep the country in a condition of unrest and
uncertainty and turmoil. A man of sound statesman
ship, even if nominated on the Chicago platform,
would be more acceptable to a majority of the Amer
ican people than Bryan on any platform whatever.
Jones and his fellow schemers are therefore going the
wrong way to work to win over the conservatives of
their party. So long as Bryan leads the way none
but wild colts will follow.

PARIS, June- 11.â Although in one re-
Fpect a duel yesterday between Drs.
Pozzi and Devillers resembled most others
in which swords are weapons, there was
an almost startling departure from estab

Â¦without the presence of a single specta
tor. This Is a refreshing innovation wor
thy of note.
Of late duels have become one of the
most sought after forms of amusement aa
a spectacle. In fact, to such an cxfnt
has this sanguinary sentiment taken hold
of the public that at a recent meeting, in
addition to a brigade of reporters, a bat
taMcn of onlookers and a crowd of ama
teur photographer?, there was even an en
terprising agent from ar cinematographic
exhibit ir^on the ground fully equipped
w-i:h srfThi? pnraphernaHÂ»"fcl"Â£ood work
ing order, ready to record for the benent
of his clientele every .phase and incident
cf the duel.
In the drawing of lots for places, choice
cf f words and director of the combat, for
tune rather favored Dr. Devillers. as he
Â¦won the two latter points. Both the com
â¢teaiants stripped off their coats and waist
coats, crossed their blades and hostilities
bocsn The affair was over in a flash, for
immediately Dr. Devlllers' Fword reached

VICTORIA, B. C. June 10.â Dawson ad
vices report the arrival there of R. C.
Geary from Nome, bringing advices to
March 19. Geary says when he left Nome
the question of fuel shortage was troub
ling the miners. What little coal there
was there was selling for $100 per ton, and
beach wood which had been brought for
a distance of twenty miles was selling:
for $40 per cord.
A number of new rich strikes are 're
ported from districts In the vicinity of
Nome. People were stampeding all over
the country, and miners were locating as
many claims as they could place stakes
around before the spring rush began.
Many ex;.re.-s ffar that in the event of
the later discovered districts not turning
cut ns well as anticipated, there will be
much overcrowding at Nome, and he says
thÂ»? fear is being expressed there that
destitution and hardship will ensue.
A letter received at Dawson from Nome
dated March 15 say3 there have been a
perii-s. of rich strikes. Another writer
tells hJs friends there to come at once,
for "this place is the richest place in the
world." Another letter received at Daw
son gays:
"I met Tat Sullivan, who has been here
since the rich diggings were struck. He
made the first rocker used on the beach,
but as he had all the carpenter work
he could do he staked a man, who went
up the beach and struck a rich snot
where he rocked out $1000 in one day. ,ThJs
Is a fact, as several people here will vouch
for. Then Pat got a rocker and averaged
$30 a day for the time he worked on the
beach, so he thinks this is a pretty good
country."
Another writer. Miller, a Dawson res
taurant man, says in a letter to friends
"People are doing little but stampeding
from one part of the country to another.
I think it Is worse than Dawson ever was,
and besides Dawson was never in it in the
way of cheerful liars. A gang of men
go to a new section, where there is no
recorder, form a new mining district,
rlect one of their number recorder and
then start a stmnpede. The result Is sev
eral hundred dollars for fees alone.. .
â¢â¢There are boodlers here that can give
the Yukon officials cards and spades. In
fact, some of them are graduates from
Dawson." ' -

GEORGE DOBBS AND MRS.
NEW GRANTED NEW TRIAL
Under Sentence for the Murder of the
"Womfm's Husband Nearly
Three Years Ago.
TOPEKA, Kans.. June 10.â The Supreme
Court has reopened the celebrated murder
cases of George Dobba and Mrs. Amelia
New, now serving life sentences In the
Lansing penitentiary for the murder near
Eureka, in 1SS7, of Joseph New, the
woman's husband. The court has grant
ed a writ of coram nobis, which is in
effect an order to the District Court to
hear the application for a new trial, which
the lower court had refused.
Dobbs and Mrs. New were convicted
two years ago. The theory was that they
were in love and conspired to get rid of
New so they might marry. After they had
been In the penitentiary for some time
Alvin Ballard, sent up for horse stealing,
assorted he could prove that Dobbs and
Mrs. New were innocent. Ballard said
Frank Allgood. now in the penitentiary
for forgery, William Turner and he were
the real murderers. Ballard told the story
in detail, saying he belonged to a robber
band organized by Allgood, and told the
officers where they could find many stolen
horses and vehicles. Ballard was taken
from the penitentiary to verify his asser
tions and aided the officers in recovering
much stolen property. On the strength of
this evidence application for a hearing in
the cases of Dobbs and Mrs. New wa3
made before the District Court of Green
wood County, where they were convicted,
but the motion was refused. Now that
the Supreme Court has overruled the
lower court's decision the motion for a
new trial will be heard at orice.

MURDEROUS HOODLUM
CAUGHT IN OAKLAND
Harrison Porter, known in police circles
as "Skinny," was arrested in Oakland
yesterday and brought across the bay to
the City Prison, where he was booked on
a charge of assault with intent to commit
murder. He is one of the three hoodlums
who murderously attacked Police Officer
McHugh at Twelfth and Harrison streets
last Sunday week while he was trying to
arrest them for disturbing the peace. The
officer had hold of Porter, but had to
let go of him when his two companions
came to the rescue with a shovel.
Policemen Blyer and RIehl have been
on Porter's trail ever since his escape
from McHugh. They tracked him from
town to town and finally located him in
Oakland.

Old Mr. Poyser's attention was attract
ed by choking sounds coming from his

AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
PHILADELPHIA, June 10.â The Repub
lican convention city of 1900 has every
thing In readiness, practically, for the
Quadrennial gathering of the Republicans
of the United States, ten days in advance
of the date fixed for the opening session.
The magnificent convention hall is com
plete In every detail and awaits only the
hour of noon, June 19.
The preparations for the coming gather
ing â¢were, carried on by two large commit
tees. One had charge of the arrangements
for the serious work of the convention,
Â¦while the other committee 'was assigned
the task of properly entertaining the vis
itors. While the iirst committee is resting
on its oars the other body of workers will
have no rest until It shall have sent home
the visitors.
All the larger hostelrles and the exclu
sive apartment houses have been booked
to their capacity. Quite a number of
State delegations have rented houses en
tirely for all of next week. The storm
center of the convention between the ses
sions will be the Hotel Walton, where the
national committee will have its head
quarters. The meetings of the? Xational
Committee will begin next Wednesday
The Walton will also be the stamping
grounds of the Maine, Connecticut, New
Yferk, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and
Missouri State delegations. - The Vice
Presidential booms or the sons of these
States will also find lodgment at the Wal
ton.
National Chairman Hanna and Secre
tary Dick will occupy suites of rooms at
the Bellevue, along with Senator Lodge
of Massachusetts and other leading Re
publicans. The convention hall is located
in West Philadelphia, close to the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania's group of build-
Ings, and Is one and one-half miles from
the hotel district. Transportation to and
from the hall is ample.
Splendid Auditorium.
The auditorium has been pronounced by
Republican national leaders and news
paper correspondents who have attended
many national conventions to be the most
magnificent in appearance and most com
filete in every detail of any structure built
n this country for similar purposes. The
acoustic properties of the hall in its en
larged condition have not yet been prac
tically tested, but experts are of the opin
ion that they are as perfect as can be ex
pected of an auditorium of such size.
The seating capacity is close to 16,000.
The press s>tand, for 500 working news
papermen, is directly in front of the stage
and is four feet above the main floor. In
front of the press stand is the space for
the delegates, which is exactly in the cen
ter of the hall. Back of the delegates are
the seats for the alternates. On all four
sides of the hall, running from the main
floor well up to the roof, are banked row
after row of seats. There is only one gal
lsry, which runs the entire width of the
hall at the rear. The band will be located
in the center of the gallery.
Back of the stage and away from the
noise of the crowd are located numerous
committee rooms. The telegraphic facili
ties are ample, the Western Union and
Postal Telegraph companies and the As
sociated Press having spacious rooms
close to the stage and which are reached
by tunnels under the seats. There are
nearly 200 wires running from the" hall.
The committee of citizens having charge
of the arrangements have raised nearly
$130,000 for the convention.
v Seats for the Press.
No committee has had a harder task
than that assigned to the press commit
tee. It had COO seats in the press section
at its disposal to be awarded Vto news
paper men actually doing work for the
papers and using the wires." More
than 2000 applications were received. The
correspondents fortunate enough to get
seats will find their quarters extremely
pleasant. There is scarcely a poor seat
in the 500. The busiest man for the next
two weeks will be Sergeant-at-Arms Wis
well. His headquarters are located in the
old Courthouse, and there a big corps of
clerks, stenographers and typewriters is
working to its fullest capacity. Each del
egate will receive two tickets besides his
own and eich alternate will receive only
his own ticket. Each National Commit
teeman is to receive twenty-five seats.
Four thousand go to the city of Philadel
phia and the remainder will be distrib
uted among the invited guests by the Na
tional Committee. President McKinley
will receive a certain number for his pri
vate distribution.
The National Committee will hold Its
first session in this city on Wednesday,
when the organization of the convention
will in all likelihood be' taken up and
passed upon. The greatest task assigned
to the National Committee will be the
matter of contests. The committee Is ex
pected to take such action as will make
the work of the credentials committee
easier. With the exception of the Elev
enth Pennsylvania Congressional District,
every delegate to the convention in the
United States has been elected. As far as
known here notice of contests have been
given as follows: . '
Alabamaâ Two entire delegations.
Delawareâ Two entire delegations.
Georgia â First and Fifth districts.
Louisianaâ Second Â£.nd Fifth districts.
Pennsylvaniaâ Nineteenth District.
Texas â Delegates at large and First, Fourth,
Fifth. Sixth. Seventh and Ninth districts.
Tennessee â Delegates at larte.
The social programme for convention
week will Vie about as complete as It can
be made. All the Republican clubs in the
city have formed a general organization
and are working as a unit.
On Monday night there will b*> a mon
ster torchlight. parade in which 25,000 men
are expected to march. Excursions have
been arranged for every day to points of
interest around the city, and the nights
will be given up to banquets, smokers,
concerts and other forms of entertain
ment. On Tuesday, June 19, in the even
ing there will b* a monster mass-meeting
which will be addressed by the best ora
tors among the leaders in the party.
Prominent Senators will be tendered com
plimentary dinners. The most brilliant
affair of that kind will probably be the
dinner to Chairman Hanna on Saturday
night, June 16.
The vanguard of the convention crowd
is already here. Senator Scott of West
Virginia and National Committeeman
Henry C. Payne of Wisconsin arrived
yesterday, while among to-day's arrivals
were Committeeman Joseph Manly of
Maine,' Embassador to Mexico Powell
Clayton, who represents Arkansas on the
National Committee: Judge G. W. Hey
burn of Idaho and .1. M. Ashton. one of
the delegates at large from
Chairman Hanna and Secretary Dick are
expected to-morrow.
WILL MAKE NO EFFORT
TO NOMINATE DEWEY
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 10. â The Demo
cratic State Convention meets here next
Tuesday to elect delegates at large and
alternates to the Kansas City convention
and to nominate candidates for Electors
at large. Secretary of State, Judge of the
Supreme Court, Dairy and Food Commis
sioner. Commissioner of Schools and mem
bers of the Beard of Public Works.
The Indications are that the bip four
to the National Convention will have new
timber. It has been the custom for the
Governor or the candidate for Governor
at the preceding election to head the list
of delegates at large. John R. McLean,
proprietor of the Cincinnati Enquirer,
headed the Democratic ticket for Gover
ernor last year, and would be selected as
the head of. the Ohio delegraticn to Kan
sas City this year, but he announces that
other engagements will prevent Him from
attending the Kansas , City convention.
Mr. McLean sails with his family lor
Kurope next Saturday, to be out of the
country, for an indefinite period." .
There will be no effort* to advance the
Dewev candidacy for the Presidency, as
some bad expected would be the case here

rockets and specially arranged pieces
that burned with a fierce blaze, but Fitz
stuck to it and, outside of the bunches of
swats, satisfied the crowd.
The Dudes were a bit lucky and
"swatty" in the first Inning, settting the
boy at the score board hard at work.
Drennan took a constitutional to the tirst
sack, made the middle station on a passed
ball and third on Lange's out, scoring
on Hutchinson's single. Hutchinson
crossed the rubber on Franck's double
and a homer by Mosklman made the
fourth run. Dunleavy went to first on
Reitz's error and Mangerlno followed with
a single to right. A hit by Mike Steffaniâ
wonderful to relateâ scored Dunleavy and
sent the other Mediterranean to second.
Drennan's hit -to right scored Mangerino.
Just a half dozen runs.
In the third, by a succession of hits and
some accommodating errors by Hank's
pretty nine. Mangerlno and Drennan
crossed the plate.
Frisco's first run came in the fourth,
when Sullivan jogged to ilrst on four bad
ones, went to second on Lange's error of
Pabst's hit and scored on Reitz's single.
Oakland added another to its list in this
inning. A three-bagger by Franeks and a
hit by Moskiman did the work.
In the sixth the local team scored one.
Sullivan was safe on Lango's error and
went to second on Pabst's hit, scoring on
Pabsfs force at second. But the seventh
was full of joyful tidings to heart-sick
Hank. The Graeco-Roman battery. Stef
fani and Mangerino. posed for their pic
tures while on the bench and after that
they were off the earth for a time. Stef
fani walked the fireman and Brockhoff
in succession and then Hildebrand flew
to center. Schwartz's uniform collided
with the ball and the sacks became bur
dened to the full. Sully flew to center and
made the second dead one. But right here
the scoring began. "Lager" Pabst hit to
Steffani and was safe on the play, the
fireman crossing the plate. A hit by
Reitz to Hutchinson, who threw to Stef
fani but not In time to kill the runner,
meant two other runs for the local team,
Brockhoff and Schwartz scoring. Pabst
was caught at the plate on the fake play
at second.
In the ninth Schwartz went to the first
sack on a hit after Hildebrand had per
ished. A hit by Sully and some juggling
put the runners respectively on third and
second. Pabst followed with a hit and
Schwartz scored, a double play ended the
game. The score:

WHITEHEAD WINS
CHAMPION STAKE
FROM SIR PASHA
Following a profrramme of close and ex
citing races, Bohe in the deciding round of
the open stake at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday beat Mamie Pleasant In aa
pretty a course as has ever been run on
those grounds. There was no choice of
dogs In the betting and considerable
money was wagered on the result. Slipped
to a fast hare, the hounds shot up the
center of the field like a double team, un
til near the hare, close to the fence. Bohe
then drew out a length for the turn and
the dogs wore In a close mix-up until
Bohe made the kiil with a score of 9 JtO
6. Time ZS seconds.
Flower of Gold and Greenhall were
forced to run three courses before a de
cision was reached. Clarkson's dog: was
unsighted in the first, but joined in the
S chase and evened up the score. After a
1 short undecided Greonhall still showed
J speed and would havfl won but for a bad
; tumble. ...
I Singleton beat Morr.ir.gr Glory at 1 to 3^
i in a good race. The r.inner reached third
I money in the stake and throughout the
; day put up some s^ud performances.
Mamie Pleasant, the runner-up, showed
; herself a same greyhound. She was put
1 to the test in every race and took her
punishment in pocd shape. In the fourth
rour.d she beat Goiden Kule on the short
end. 'Shea's doj? led to the hare, but
'Â¦ Mamie oi:twcrkou her in a close score.
She followed this by beating Lexington
in a hard run and upset the talent, who
posted 3 to 1 against ker in a bye with St.
Mei^ii. Bohe \v;i.s not worked hard until
; she met SinplPton in the sixth round.
After making the lull she sighted a stray
hare and buth dogs were soon doing
stunts after the lively jack. Relief dogs
were at once turned loose and one of them
recorded a kill, but not before the hounds
were well pumpod ou t.
Firm Foe and Lottie M were withdrawn
from the stake in the fifth round on ac
count of severe work in previous runs.
Kittle V was beaten by Sweet Music in a
pretty race which was run in front of rhe
grand stand.

Naval Beserve Ship Marion Has a
Taste of Blue Water of
the Ocean. ; -.'1
The Marion poked her nose out through
the Golden Gate yesterday and took a
Bhort run out in' the. Toller* beyond the
heads. It was the first time the old ship
had ventured beyond the limits, of -the
bay I or. a long time, and she seemed to
enjoy her freedom as she wallowed In the
swells and tossed herself about like an
overgrown porpoise. â¢
The occasion was the Inspection of the
vessel by the State authorities, and Cap
tain James took advantage of the oppor
tunity to carry , the inspectors out into
blue water for a ilttle way.
Lieutenant Colonel Hosmer and Major
General Dickinson were the inspecting of
ficers. They were accompanied by Colo
nel Miles and Major Schmidt. It was ex
pected that Captain Glass, commanding
officer of the Pensacola, would be of the
inspecting party, but he was ordered- to
Mare Island at the last moment-
A course was first laid for Red Rock,
then turning, the old ship waa brought
down through Raccoon Straits and out
through the heads. Sne Is Just light
enough for work outeide and she rode the
seas like a duck. She had some of her
fore and afters set and they steadied her
a bit, and for over an hour she disported
herself in -the swells of the bar basin.
.Then she turned back to tha harbor and
anchored" at her old berth" off Folsom
street without accident

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD
HAVE A GRAND OUTING
lord Jt over God's heritage. Ordinanlr
the atmosphere of adulation In which a
bishop lives is very conducive to compla
cency. For once a man becomes a bisnop,
everything he does takes on a fictitious
value. A bishop never preaches a poor
fermon. Perish the thought! A bishop Is
made "f different clay from his fellow
Methodist preachers. A month at general
conference is a healthy thing for many or
our bishops. St. Paul needed to nave a
thorn In the flesh lest he should be ex
alted above measure, and perhaps the
general conference sometimes serves a
like purpose. , , ,
-The truth is that the political and ar
bitrary actions of two or three bishops
has caused a widespread disaffection, ana
bishops whose conduct is abovo criticism
have had to suffer from It. The bishops
are no longer allowed to choose their own
appointment, but are assigned to It like
other Methodist preachers, und the taking
away of the life tenure and restrict
ing each bishop to a diocese Is sure to
come In the near future."
Dr. Dille declared that the removal of
the "time limit" upon pastorates would
tend to upbuild the church In the cities
and to compel better service from the
cleriry. He believed it would result in
more changes in pulpits than took place
under the time rule. In concluding he
said Methodism needed more than a great
eccleslasticlsm. It needed flre and divine
spirit from above.
COURTS WILL DECIDE
THE DALTON CASE
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 10.
The wrangling over the indictment of
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton seems
to have petered out or the wranglers have
taken a Sunday off. There have been no
charges by any one to-day that Grand
Juries were being used to railroad any
one out of or into Congress. The people
have settled down to waiting for the ver
dict of the courts as to whether the Grand
Jury is right about the County Assessor
or the County Assessor Is right about the
Grand Jury.
The members of the Grand Jury that
found the indictment are among the
most responsible and highly trusted resi
dents of Alameda County. The breath of
suspicion has never been pointed at one
of them. On the other hand. County As
sessor Dalton has always stood as a
county official who has always done hia
duty. Now nineteen of the best citizens
of Alameda County have found the Ab
sessor guilty of destroying public records
and have indicted him therefor. They
have also found him guilty of failing to
do his duty in order to protect himself,
and they have ordered him removed from
office.
The County Assessor says that these
nineteen men were swayed by political
prejudice in making these charges. The
grand Jurors reply that they were swayed
only by the facts. The public is waiting
to -see what the outcome will be. No
move can be made until Wednesday, when
County Assessor Dalton will appear In the
criminal department of the Superior Court
to plead to his Indictment. Mr. Dalton
has employed Fitzgerald & Abbott as his
attorneys, and from now on it will be a
fight arid a fight to a finish.
Struetur3 to Be Erected at Valley and Church Streets.
PLANS and specifications have been prepared by Architects Shea & Shea for
the new church of St. Paul, at the corner of Valley and Church streets, in
this city. The design shows a beautiful structure of Gothic architecture.
Rev. Father M. D. Connolly, pastor of the church, has already started the
foundations, which will be of concrete, brick and granite. When completed the
total cost of the edifice will not exceed $oO,0(Â»0, owing to the careful management of
Father Connolly, who gives his personal supervision to the construction, purchase
of materials and employment of labor. The structure will be 70 feet wide and 140
feet long, with a seating capacity of 900. and will be ready for worship in one year.
The* church is of picturesque outline and simple detail. Lofty spires flank the
outer portals and well-proportioned gables project and emphasize the transept
portions. The roof will be of slate and the side aisle walls are pierced with large
windows and richly decorated with dormer ornamentations. Each gable possesses
a large and elegant rose window, which affords grace to these special features of
the church exterior. ... â
. The interior is planned with side aisles, which have vaulted ceilings of equal
height supported upon slender columns, from which spring arches which follow
continuously around the entire church. A special feature of the Interior design is
the inclined floor and elevated sanctuary, permitting easy and unobstructed view
from all parts of the church. The sacristies are very spacious, and the arrange
ments for placing stations of the cross, confessionals, baptistry, access to gallery
and all other fixtures, including the pulpit, are admirable. The covered and artistic
front portico with triple arches and clustered columns is approached by wide
granite steps.
Accommodations will be provided in the church edifice for the several societies
connected with the parish, including the Holy Name Society, with a membership
of ISO: Young Ladies' Society, 100 members; Holy Angels' Sodality, 110 members;
St Vincent de Paul Society, for the relief of the poor of the parish, 150 members,
and the League of the Cross TemperanceSociety, 200 members.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
/ 111S Broadway, June 10.
A quarrel about a stove boiler caused a
shooting affray in West Oakland's White
chapel district this morning, the result
of which was the arrest of Dr. J. A. Am
brose Sander on a charge of assault to
murder, with the incidental narrow es
cape of James Dickinson, a colored saloon
keeper, from death.
Each man claims the other was the ag

Dr. Sander exhibits a badly bruised
scalp and a battered " high hat as
evidence of Dickinson's lively drub

negro points to a bullet hole in the wall
and says the missile from Sander's pistol
missed him by a hair's breadth. Dickin

used Mrs. Dickinson as a shield and fired
at him from behind that living bulwark.

"There is nothing in these stories of
retirements." ;â¢
This is the way in which President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler to-day disposed of a
number of rumors about the impending
retirement of the University of California
instructors.
It would seem from these rumors that
nearly everybody from Professor Joseph
le Conte down is to be removed from his
position in the insitution of learning, but
somehow President Wheeler docs not
agree with rumor in this matter. The
president, who has supreme authority in
6uch affairs under his agreement with
the Regents, contents himself with this
simple announcement, but adds:
"If there are any changes to be made
they will be announced In due time to the
Regents."
There have been plenty of rumors of
changes to be made by President Wheeler
before the next semester, but these ru
mors have been without any foundation
except the general expectation that Presi
dent Wheeler had some radical plans for
the rearrangement of the University fac
ulty. These rumors have been springing
up at regular intervals since President
Wheeler took charge, but they have never
materialized.
As a matter of fact it is the general
opinion that the rumors have been start
ed by some of those interested with the
object of creating a sentiment against
changes should any be contemplated. The
circulation of the story of the retirement
of Professor Joseph le Conte lends color to
this statement, for there is no man at the
State University more secure than "Pro
fessor Joe," who holds the respect of
every student and the admiration of every
professor.
But President Wheeler says he has no
changes in contemplation, and if he did
have he would probably make announce
ment to the Regents before ordering them.
President Wheeler has been seeking the
co-operation of the old staff and it is not
likely that he will make any changes
among those who have built up the State
Institution. If any changes are contem
plated stories about the retirement of such
men as Professor le Conte will do more
than anything else to create prejudice
against carrying them out.
University Pcsident Adds, However,
That if Retirements Are to Be
Ordered Regents Will Be No
tified Beforehand. \

Changes.

"Tho most radical and revolutionary
general conference in the history of the
Methodist church, was tho way cr.e bishop
described ihc Chicago gathering," said
Itev. B. R. Dille. pastor of the First
Methodist Church, this evening during an
exhaustive review before his congregation
of the work of that great quadrennial as
semblage of churchmen.
Dr. Dillo'g discourse, in part, follows
"When this FuLject of equal ministerial
and lay representation was before the an
nual conference 1&.2T0 ministers voted for
equal representation and 1,120 against it;
but when the general conference concur
red there was not a dissenting vote. That
shows that the ministers are now, as ever,
vttUas to share their power with the
laity, up to l^TZ the ministers held all
the power in our church, and need not
have shared it with anybody. Indeed,
when lay representation was first proposed
the laymen voted it down; but when the
time was npe the ministers welcomed the
laity to their chief councils with open
iirms.
"Ths first action of the general con
ference, consummated before noon of the
first day. was the keynote to the progres
sive spirit of the whole session. The con
ference seemed determined from the lirst
to give Methodism a programme for the
new century worthy of tee century and
the church.
"The general conference of 1900 came at
a criilcaJ time in the history of our
church. The Methodist church, which for
a century had been the church of the com
mon people, had not been reaching the
people as formerly. It was actually fac
ing a sma.ll decline in membership. In
xnar.y quarters it was more than suspected
that the black waters of worldliness were
inundating her life and putting out the
tires on her altars; that there was a strong
trend to officialism and self-seeking in her
ministry, and that we were in the after
noun and approaching the sunset of
Mc-thodiem. But the recent conference
i^me like an ocean breezÂ« on a sultry day
and cleared the air.
â¢'The general conference demonstrated
the growing democratic spirit of Method-
Ism. Hitherto there had been too much
power atop and too little responsibility on
the average man, whether layman or
preacher. We have been governed over
much and not self-governed enough. Well,
the admission nf lay delegates on equal
terms, the giving the lay electoral confer
ences a right to vote on all constitutional
que-Mions. the requiring that class leaders
thall be approved by a vote of the quar
terly conference thus making it impos
sible for a preacher to pack his quarterly
conference, permitting the membership of
the church to vole for trustees â all these
arc straws which show the way the wind
blows.
"The change in the constitution admit
ting women to the general conference is
another step in the direction of making
the Methodist Episcopal church a dem
ocracy, and thus bringing it into harmony
v. ith the American spirit and the spirit of
the nineteenth century.
"The first (run of the campaign of re
trenchment and reform fired by the laity
was the resolution adopted oarly in the
Bessioo providing that no bishop or gen
eral confer* nee oflicer should receive any
thir-s' above actual expenses for his ser
vices in dedicating and reopening
churches, attending college commence
ments and such like ecrviccs for the
eh"r< hcs.
"It v.-as well known that there had been
very crave abuses on this line In very high
Quarters, and that bishops and general
conference officers whose time belonged
to the church had charged large sums for
dt-dicatiwr struggling churches and at
tending college commencements.
"Our church rccopnizcp. too, that in the
life tenure and the irresponsible power
of the Episcopacy thorp lurks a subtle
j. rr>?,:rition. and that while human nature
remains as It Is the possession of irre-
Fp'insllile power ten<is to make men pomp
ou?, haushty magisterial, tyrannical;
and the quadrennial conference serves as
a wholesome reminder to some of them
ihat thoir brethren did not lift them to
the high place they hold that they might

al trips to the place to arrange for their
removal. The doctor's story Is as fol
lows:
I went down there this morning with
William Kelly to disconnect a stove and
I found George Morton there in charge.
He refused to let me touch it and while
we were wrangling Dickinson came
along on crutches. He called me vile
names and hit me twice on the head,
stunning me. To scare him I flred a shot
in the air from my pistol. 1 did not intend
to move anything away that did not be
long to me."
Dickinson's version made the stove
boiler the object of disturbance. He
-laimed it as a portion of the house fix
tures, while the doctor demanded It as a
portion of the personal effects to which he
was entitled. The colored man declares
that Sander and he mixed and the crutch
was used in defense, Dickinson being
crippled from an Injured ankle.
After that row, according to the negro,
Sander left the place, but returned in a
few moments, ran behind Mrs. Dickinson
and fired at her husband, after poking
the pistol under her arm. Before a sec
ond shot could be discharged, Morton,
Dickinson's handy man, disarmed the doc
tor. The police were called, but Sander
was not arrested until he had reached
his offices at 908 Washington street. The
doctor asserted that a mob of colored men
surrounded the house during the row and
he reared he would be maltreated unless
he used his pistol.

BISHOP LENIHAN PREACHES
AT HOLY CROSS CHURCH
Distinguished Visitor From Auck
land Discusses the Work of
the Catholics.
Right Reverend Bishop Lenlhan, of
Auckland, N^w Zealand, preached morn
ing and evening at Holy Cross Church
yesterday. At the 11 o'clock mass he told
of his experiences in Australia and dwelt
at, length on the growth of Catholicism In
that country. In the evening his dis
course was devoted to the charitable
work of the church. At the outset of his
sermon he said he proposed to point out
some of the works or institutions that
have been established by the Catholics.
He said there was' not a phase of human
misery or affliction for which the church
has not found an antidote or at least a
mitigation. He then went on to enumer
ate the various institutions thus estab
lished. He called attention to the found
ling asylums, the homes for the aged, the
Magdalen asylums, the asylums for the
insane and the lepers. He dwelt at length
upon the splendid work being done by all
these institutions. In discussing the
foundling asylums he paid a beautiful
tribute to the noble sisters in charge of
those institutions. He told how they gave
up the pleasures of life to labor among the
waifs who never -knew a parent's love.
He told how the sisters watched over and
cared for the babes, rescuing them from
death so that they might be brought up
good citizens. He said the sisters never
questioned the nationality or faith of the
parents of the foundlings.
The bishop then spoke at length on the
need of homes for the aged and afflicted,
of orphan, insane and leper asylums. He
told of the brave Catholic priest who sac
rificed his life on the island of Molokal
caring and tending to the spiritual wel
fare of the lepers who Inhabit that place.
He said that on Father Damlen's death
Other priests and Sisters of Mercy volun
teered and were pent to the leper colony
to care for the unfortunates. He said it
â¢was but a matter of time before they
would be afflicted with the dread disease,
but they faced death without fear and
with the knowledge that they were doing
their duty to the unfortunates.

The Russian syndicate, headed by Count
Charles Bogdanovitcb, that Is to prospect
the Siberian coast for gold, sailed for the
frozen north on the chartered steamer
Samoa yesterday. There are about forty
in. the party, all told, among them beins
twenty-seven miners, headed by H. Rob
erta of Comstock fame, but more recently
of Grass Valley. Paul de Lamschkaffsky
also accompanies Count Bogdanovltch. He
was formerly a Russian mail agent and
knows every bay and inlet on the Siberian
coast. The vessel cleared for Alexander
Bay and will be gone about six months.
The Samoa was to have sailed last week,
but several things delayed her. Among
those who were to have gone north on her
were fifteen Chinese. Owing to the quar
antine on Chinatown these could not go.
eo white men had to be got in their places.
Then when everything seemed In readi
ness for a start it was found that fifty
barrels of bottled beer intended for the
comfort for the cabin passengers during
the hot weather was not aboard. In order
to make room for the beer eight tons of
coal had to be taken out of the hold and
dumped on the wharf. As soon as the
beer was safely stowed the coal was
sacked and piled up on deck. This was
the last hitch and at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning the Samoa got away for Siberia
with the members of the Russian Explor
ation Company aboard. Gold is said to be
as plentiful on the Siberian coast as it
is at Cape Nome and Cape York and
Count Bogdanovltch and his associates
have received from the Czar the right to
mine for it.
Balclutha's Close Call.
The British sn.p Balclutha, which ar
rived from Newcastle, N. S. W., yester
day, had a close call at the Farallones.
It was very thick and a good lookout was
kept, so Captain Hatfiela saw his danger
just in time to escape the North Faralion
rock.
The Balclutha. Is seventy-four days
from Newcastle. On April IS she ran Into
a heavy gale, accompanied by a high and
dangerous sea. On May 11 Bird Island
was passed. "This is a high unhablted
island teeming with sea fowl of every
description." says Captain Hatfield. "On
June S it set in very thick and at II p. m.
the ship passed close to Noonday rock.
Its warning bell being the first indica
tion we had of being on the California
coast," he continued. "On June 9 at 2
a. m. we passed very cloae to the North
FaraUones. It was very thick and the
light variable winds did not take us away
from the dangerous spot very quickly.
I'll never forget that spot. The war of
the surf, the bellowing of the seal and the
stink of bird guano was too much for me
and my crew and when the tug Relief
came aiong It did not take us long to get
a hawser aboard and soon thereafter
were anchored in the bay."
Sugar' Boats Arrive.
Eight vessels of the sugar fleet made
port yesterday. Some of them made fair
passages, while others were away behind
time. The ship Kmlly P. Whitney was
the longest -out. It took her 35
days to get here from Kahului. On June 6
she was caught In a heavy gale, during
which she lost her main top gallant mast.
Of the others the Haydn Brown was 31
days from Kahului, the Alice Cook Â£9
days from Honolulu, the William H. Dl
mond 22 days from Honolulu and the Rob
ert Lewers 22V t . S. N. Castle 17 and Mary
E. Foster 15"-j days from the same port.
The Eva made the best run of the Meet.
15 days from Hana. Captain Johnson of
the Clipper bark Roderick Dhu was dis
gusted over his long run of 21 days from
Hllo. but now that he sees what long
runs the rest of the fliers of the sugar
fleet have been making he Is beginning
to feel a little more satisfied with himself.
The Fidalgo Fizzle.
A tale of misplaced confidence is
brought to light by the libÂ«I filed in the
United States District Court against the
three-masted schooner Fldalgo for sea
men's wages. When John W. (better
known as "Wildcat") Parsons bought
the old vessel last February 3hÂ«
was the Alexander. For years she
had lain on the beach off Alameda
Point and was considered an old
hulk. Pardons conceived the idea of fit
ting her up for the Nome trade. He aid
not have much money, but plenty of
nerve, so he had her towed over to Mis
sion Bay and hired a crew of twenty men
and a cook to do the work. The men
were promised, so they say, top-notch sea
men's wages from the time they Â¦were en
gaged until the end of the Nome season
ana perhaps all winter. For running ex
penses they were to be allowed 50 cents
per day cash, and the balance when they
returned from their first voyage.
On this basis the men worked up to May
12, when even the 50 cents per day was
stopped. On June 2 Parsons, it Is alleged,
turned the whole crew out. telling them
he had no more work for them. By that
time nearly all of the men were In des
perate financial straits. They are of the
better class of sailors and some of them
have families to support. The crews of
the Xome packets had all bÂ«en made up
and the destitute crew could not find
berths* One man had to pawn his wife's
dress to buy lood and another walked thÂ«
streets one night because he had ; no
money to buy lodgings. ,
The men appealed to Attorney F. R.
Wall, who prepared the papers for the
libel of the vessel. The total amount of
wages due the men, according to his reck
oning. Is $1023. which will have to be
paid, unless the court decrees otherwise,
before the Fldalgo can leave the harbor.
There is small chance of her getting
away, anyhow, because it .is the opinion
of people along the front that the In
spector of Hulls will find her unseawor
thy.
Found Floating in the Bay.
The badly decomposed body of a man
was found floating off Pacific-street wharf
yesterday by Ed Johnson of the tug Re
lief and sent to the Morgue. The body is
that of a man about 40 years of age. of
stout build, 170 pounds. 5 feet S inches in
neipht. brown hair, bald on top. The
teeth are good, except for the absence of
one of the upper front teeth, which might
have dropped out while the body was In
the water. The deceased was dressed in
well-worn black diagonal clothes, sack
coat, pointed lace shoes, white shirt, turn
down collar and cuffs attached, and with
out underclothes. A purse containing 50
cents, a knife, keys, harness ring and an
old-fashioned silver chain of three strands
and two slides, with a tassel charm of the
same material, were found on the body.
Water Front Notes.
The horse transport Slam arrived ves
terday. 33 days from Manila via Nagasaki
18 days. The crew deserted while the ves

and were stranded manged to stow them
selves away on the Siam and were not
discovered until the ship, was a couple
of days on the way to San Francisco.
The Siam was not quarantined and la now
anchored off the transport wharf.

Sail for Siberian Gold
Â¦, Fields.
Eighteen little girls dressed in white
and bearing lighted candles in their hands
received first communion in St. Anthony's
Church, on Army street,' near Folsom,
yesterday morning. The ceremonies were
solemn and beautiful. The parents and
friends of the little maids filled the sa
cred edifice and manifested a deep Interest
in the services, which were conducted by
Rev. Father Raphael Fuhr, O. F. M., the
pastor of the church.
The children prepared for this impor
tant event in their lives by fasting and
meditation. They assembled in the school
which Is connected with the church and
as the bells rang out the signal for the
8 o'clock solemn high mass they marched
into the edifice and .took seats of honor
Close to the altar. Following close be
hind the girls were five boys, who also
received communion. Preliminary to this
important ceremony. Father Fuhr preach
ed a short sermon appropriate to the oc
casion, after which the children stood
with lighted candles and made their sol
emn profession of faith.
Solemn high mass was then celebrated.
The choir rendered some sacred music
and at the conclusion of the mass Father
Fuhr again ascended the pulpit and
preached an able sermon, which was par
ticularly Intended for the parents of the
children. The speaker pointed out their
duty to their little ones and appealed to
them to bring them up in the path of
righteousness.
The children then offered their lighted
candles to the priest as a symbol that
their hearts, like the candle, shall burn
Â¦with love for the Lord. Just before com
munion and after that ceremony the pas
tor grave them advice which he said he
hoped they would follow in the years to
come. He also appealed to them to re
tain their love and confidence in God.
The sermon was simple and was intended
to reach the hearts of the little ones.
Then, two by two, the girls and boys ap
proached the altar and received their first
communion. These services lasted until
11 o'clock. At the close of the services
the children returned to the schoolhouse
and were Rlvon a hearty breakfast by the
officers of the Mothers' Society, which
is an adjunct of the church. After the
meal a low mass of thanksgiving was
celebrated in the church. Prayers were
said and the children sang appropriate
hymns.
In the evening solemn services of
thanksgiving- were held. In his sermon
Father Fuhr appealed to the children to
bo, firm in their resolutions. At the con
clusion of the discourse the children were
received Into the confraternity of the
scapula and were made "children of
Mary." Solemn benediction of the blessed
sacrament followed, during which the lit
tle ones sang hymns.. The services closed
with the Te Dcum, and as the solemn
prayer was chanted the bells in the stee
ple of the edifice rang out on the night
air.
The choir under the direction of Miss
Lulu Curtaz rendered a number of sacred
selections during both services. The chil
dren who received first communion are:
George Buecker, Otto Mutter. John
Drewes, Joseph Rupprecht, Henry Lo

OF HIBERNIANS
orders or communications or to tell the
newspaper men that nothing was happen
ing. The dearth of news at the meetings
and the secrecy of the gatherings before
the Â¦ regular and open sessions are in
marked contrast, and either the doctors
have much to discuss or they are wasting
two hours a day in friendly converse.
More openings are appearing in the
lines, the latest being the admittance of
two missionaries, who wish to keep up
their work among the Chinese despite the
quarantine. And the report that certifi
cates have, been sold certifying that the
lucky holder has been inoculated and is
immune will not down. And the scandal
rising out of the offer to raise the quar
antine is also a factor in the situation
tiiat is still causing uneasiness.
But In any event the situation must
await the action of the courts, for the
case now pending is one that will settle
the question.
There were no demonstrations In China
town yesterday, and the Chinese Consul
reports everything within the lines quiet
and hopeful. Somehow the tip has gone
the rounds that surely on Wednesday the
quarantine will be knocked out in the
Feaeral courts. Where the report came
from is a mystery, but it is, there, and
the Chinese are looking forward to but
one more day of detention.
Work on Mission Rock has not stopped
because of the injunction, and the first
act after the proceedings in court, if the
decision be favorable to the board, will
be to take from Chinatown all the rock
will hold. This will be some relief, and
it will be followed within a few days -by
an order transporting all Chinese not able
to live within the lines to the detention
camp at. Angel Island.
fn? PATROL wagon loaded with pollce
//\ men from the California-street fcta-
II \ tion caused considerable excitement
u in the vicinity of ,Taylor and Fil
bert streets a few nights ago. Shortly be
fore midnteht the wagon bearing the blue
coats dashed over the pavement and stop,
ped before 204S Taylor street. A moment
later the officers scrambled up the steps
with drawn revolvers and disappeared
through the front door.
By this time the ftiajor portion of the
neighborhood had been alarmed by the
clatter ,and heads began to pop out of
windows to see what was the occasion of
the excitement. "When the owners of the
heads saw the patrol wagon and- caught
â¢sight of the striped legs vanishing inside
the house, visions of burglars danced be
fore them and the crack of pistols was
momentarily expected. No sound of battle
came from the building, however, and -a
few moments later the policemen slunk
sheepishly - down the steps, climbed into
the wagon and drove back to the station,
leaving the expectant neighbors to guess
the Import of their mysterious mission.
About 10 o'clock on *thfi night in ques
tion Mrs. Adolph Kepper, residing at
the number mentioned. approached
her couch to retire. She was dis
mayed to see a man sleeping thereon.
In ten leaps she gained the gro
cery store of Henry Holtmeier, a
half a block- distant, and telephoned to
the police station that a burglar was in
her house. Sergeant Duncan started the
patrol wagon for the scene. The officers
led by George Hackett and John Davids
found the lady near the place, trembling
with fear, and heard her story from her
own lips. She described the man as a des
perate character. The policemen, after
listening to her description of him, wished
they were back doing duty on the China
town blockade or even fighting Indians.
With pistols In their hands they entered
the room and covered every object In It.
Policeman Frank Howard's electric lan
tern was then brought into play. It threw
a shaft of light upon the bed, causing the
man to wake out of a sound slumber.
The sight that greeted the one thus
aroused caused his hair to stand "pompa
dour," and at the command to throw up
his hands, accompanied by the friendly tip
that he was "up against it" and might as
well surrender without a struggle, he ex
claimed: . â¢ â¢
"Katrina, what does all this mean!"
At this the woman uttered a scream and
nearly fainted. Upon recovering her
senses she explained to the policemen that
the man was her husband. The officers
put their guns away and no word was
spoken on the drive back.

SPOUSE WAS A BURGLAR BOLD
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JUNE 11, 1900.
All present Interest In the quarantine
of Chinatown is dependent upon the re
sult of the suits before the Circuit Court.
There will be one before the court to-day,
but the one on which the Chinese place
most dependence is that before Judge
Morrow, which is on the calendar for to
morrow morning-. . .
The Chinese are confident of success in
this suit, and as it strikes at the root of
the whole quarantine, it will settle the
matter finally and speedily. . Should the
suit be decided in favor of the plaintiffs
it will mean that the quarantine must be
raised at once, and .whites and Chinese
must be restored to the positions they
occupied before the quarantine was
thought of. That it will be decided in
their favor, the Chinese and their attor
neys have no doubt. :
There was no 'meeting of tee Board of
Health yesterday afternoon,! a circum
stance that is worthy of comment, for
there has been a meeting every day pre
viously since the quarantine was put on.
The meetings have showed but little bus
iness, but before c ach one of them the
board has gathered in the office of the
Health Officer and for from two to;three
hours the doctors have talked, leaving
the room only when they had to dictate

WHOLESALE ADVICE
For People Whose Stomachs Are
Weak and Digestion Poor.
Dr. Harlandson, whose opinion in dis-
eases is worthy of attention, says when a
man or woman comes to me complaining
of indigestion, loss of. appetite, sour stom-
ach, belching, sour watery-rising, head-
aches, sleeplessness, lack of ambition and
a generar run-down "nervous, condition. I
advise them to take after each* meal one
or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, al-
lowing the tablets to dissolve in the
mouth, and thus mingle with the food
eaten. The result Ms that the food is
speedily digested before it has time to
sour and ferment. These tablets will di-
gest the .food anyway whether the stom-
ach wants to or not, because they contain
harmless digestive principles, vegetable
essences, pepsin and Golden Seal which
supply Jusjt what the weak stomach lacks.
I have advised the tablets with great
success both In curing indigestion and to
build up the tissues, increasing flesh In
thin, nervous patients, whose real trouble
was dyspepsia, and as soon as the stom-
ach was put to rights they did not know
what sickness was.
A 50-cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets can be bought at any drug store,
and as they are not a secret patent medi-
cine they can be used as -' of ten as de-
sired with full assurance that they con-
tain nothing harmful in the slightest de-
gree; on the contrary, any one whose
stomach is at all deranged will find great
benefit from the use. of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets. They will cure any form of
stomach weakness or diseases except can-
cer of the stomach. .
