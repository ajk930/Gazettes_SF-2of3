ditlonary army, wanted a quartermaster
general, and who could better fill this post
than Major Roberts! Hl3 services at tha
landing place on the Red Sea were too ur
gently required to permit of his going In-
land. But whether at the front or tha
rear, Roberta never failed to bear away
the bell of energy and successful activity,
and at the close of the campaign he was
sent to London with the dispatches which
contained an ardent eulogy of his own
merits.
It had fretted the heart of the ardent
Roberts that he had not been able to go
to the front in Abyssinia and shara In
any fighting that befell; but now ho had
not' long to wait for one of those "Uttla
wars" which are to Indian soldiers what
the grand autumn, maneuvers are to con
tinental armies. Having organized, ha
was* appointed senior staff officer of ths
expedition which, about the time that
France and Germany were stripping foe
a ' fall, was sent to chastise and subju
gate the turbulent Looshai tribes on tho
southeastern confines of the Indian Em
pire toward Burmah. But staff service,
pure and simple, would not content him.
and we find him "leading the advanc*
against a stockade" in a very difficult
and dangerous country. The taking ot
Taikoom. -which ended the campaign, -was
mainly duo to the fact that the attack-
Ing column was led in person by Roberts
âthe trst time he had commanded in, ac
tion. "Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts' nn
tlring energy and sagacity." wrote tha
commanding general, "are beyond all
praise. He worked without guides, even
without map or geography, and thwarted
the Looshais, whose game was to delay,
our progress. He never seemed at a
loss."
When he was mftdo Q. M. G. in India,
and on his shoulders rented most of the
responsibility for the preparation of tha
camps and durbars necessitated aa well
by the 'Prince of Wales* vtsit to India
<'75-'"6) as by the proclamation, of the
Queen as Kalser-1-Hlnd, he wa3 no Ie33
useful and energetic in the field of fight
ing than in the field of famine ('73-'74>.
where this was how he appeared to Arch
ibald Forbes, the brilliant war corre
spondent: "Short and slight, square, how
ever, of shoulder., and of a distinctly mill-
tary carriage. hi3 whole aspect denoting
alertness and a wiry endurance. He nad,
the air of quiet command one sometimes
discerns In men who have seen much ser
vice when as yet they have not attained
high leadership. His face was almost as
cetic in its attenuation, hollow temples
Indented and narrow, th- lofty forehead
that rose above the keen, quick eyes; thw
lower section of the face was long, gaunt
and sallow, ending In a chin every lino
and contour of which betokened force o2
resolution."
So much for Forbes. One Little-wood,
orderly, says: " 'E's a little man about
as little a, man as ever drew a swordâ
not more than 3 feet T\ should sayâ but
*ecan ride! 'Ow'e can ride! Any 'orsÂ«

"Bobs! God bless h'ra!" says one Alfred

It for the simple reason that he was a
PritJsh soMlor before be was steward,
and. as orderly in the service of b!g Lit
tle Bobs, he knew him at three-foot
ra nge.
These are rrrpat days for Alfred Little
wood. His generalâ his Little Bobsâ is
adding more medals to his coat anl
glories to his name. In the quiet chug
chug hours of ferry-boat travel. Alfred
LIttlewood thinks of the new fame hia
eld-time commander is winning, and
Â¦warms himself brer tho recollections of
far-away India days, when Bobs fed the
hungry soldiers ender him as they had
not been fed since they left home, and
when be looked after .his sick lying in the
Nilgirl Hills country, and when he tilted
the rings with the privates who loved
him.
"There's nobody like himâ like Bobs,"
says his orderly.
It was In 'S2 and '83 that he served be
hind the little fighting man. It was dur
ing the quiet period that followed the re
lief cf Kandaliar. The marching out
Ftrencth of his relieving force. Including
a splendid Highland brigade 'of the "Gay
Gordons" and the Rosshlre Buffs, had
hÂ«ren about 10,000 â just the number whom
Xenophon led back from the plains of
C^naxa to the banks of the Euxine. On
August X 1273. the immortal column be
fran its march of 302 miles, and it had cov
ered the distance In twenty days. Includ
ing one of rest, which gave an average of
over fifteen miles per day. On Septem
ber 1 â the anniversary of Sedan â Roberts
gave battle to and utterly . defeated
Ayoob. After a brief rest he rode to the
various regiments in succession, begir
nfcxg i3.HJi.tiie Gordons., whose list of xas
uaHi^P was the longest, to thank them
for the successes they had achieved for
him; and he was everywhere received
with deafening cheers â cheers Which wer^
repeated, so to speak, when, after the
war was over, Roberts came to England
and received the thanks of t>oth houses
of Parliament, a peerage from the Queen
and other honors innumerable.
When. a few years later, Mandalay was
captured and Xing Thebaw deposed from
the throne of Burmah, Roberts took com
mand, arid soon, as usual, brought the
operations to a successful issue. Again,
when the cry went up to wipe out the
reverse of Majuba, Roberts was selected
as the avenging an^el. and lucky it was
for the Boers that peace had been con
cluded before the conqueror of Kandahar
had time to rearh tholr plains.
Then came times that were more quiet.
Roberts was able to return to India, hl3
birth land, and he held his post until 1SS5
as commander Â«">f ihe Madras army. "I
Â¦was with 'itn at B&r.galoa â that's in the
Madras presidency." says the Yorkshire
Littlewood. "I w&sn't with 'lm In action,
but I saw 'lm ard knew 'im when the time
vras quiet, and it takes a good man to look
aftÂ«r regiments when they're doin'
noth!n.' Bobs knows 'ow to keep 'era
'appy-
"And lie kept, us busy. too. If we
weren't fightin'. we musn't forget *ow to
f.ght. Â£<-i he "made 'a little war. Just for
practice, between the English cavalry and
the natives who were in the service. And
â¢we took sides r.nd made attacks and de
fenses, and tried to 'oM out against each
eth'rVike in real war, and if a man was
caught 'e 'ad to be shut up for a day â for
practice, you know. Eut the men liked it.
There's r.othin' Bobs could order that they
wouldn't like.
"I was in the cavalry thenâ in the
Twelfth lancers. I "ad enlisted for twelve
years because I was tired cf 'ome. and I
was pretty sick of the army before those
years were over. 1 never 'ad fever, but
India ate wp my 'ealth for all that. It's
the beastly climate. It saps the life out
cf a man, and 'e don't care much what
'jfppen*. ro 'c can only get away and ret
'onie-th.-t Ik. If 'fCÂ» got a 'omc to go to.
But w'nÂ»n men pet feelfn* like that sud
denly there's bOjnethJng goin' on that

They >zr that there's some sports goin'
on that dayâ lilting the rings, most likely.
âand if they ask they ilnd out that Bobs
Is at the :>ottom of it."
It has Iktcd always the same. At his
desk, in time* of waiting, in time of war,
Y.ti has been the same true Bobs.

Ing In, the expected numbers, the Ameri
can is undoubtedly here in all of his ex
travagant glory. On coming out of the
Art Gallery I took a chair to listen to
the band without knowing that it was
Sousa^B. Suddenly It struck up "Dixie"
and 'the '.' Suwanee Kive'r," ending of
course, with the "Star-spangled Ban
ner." ' Well, the unexpected yell that went
up from" that crowd was something to be
remembered. It came spontaneously from
the throats* of several hundred Ameri
cans, who had thus accidentally gathered
there.' Women . and children jumped
on the chairs,- shouting and waving fu
riously, while a man in the crowd pro
posed thr^e^ big American cheers for th<3
Stars and Stripes. In the midst of It all
Sou?a produced', a huge American flag
which he . waved energetically. It turned
out a most magniflceni patriotic demon
stration and all entirely Impromptu.
One of the most important pbjects to be
seen at the.Expo3itior\ ia the gift in the
Russian building which the Czar has
made to France. It is a map of France,
a metre square/most skillfully construct
ed in gems and precious metals and show-
Ing a cartographic picture of the lar.d.
The solki: backing -is of .silver. The seas
round the coasts, the departments^ inland.
Â»!1 the' various features of mountains,
pir ins, - marshes, -'lakes ami forests aro
deftly done with labradorite and. lapis
lazuli, agates, and onyxes, malachite and
carnelian, while the rivers arp put in with
pure platinum, a" valuable material spe
cially produced by Russia. .The M prin
cipal^'cities and towns_ of France' are all
designated by /various" precious V stones,
Paris being marked "with a large rose dia
mond "the Â¦Â¦ size of a hazel nut and sap
phires, emeralds, rubies, \ turquoises,
opals,, jacinths, topazes, garnets . and
pearls-'are employed for the others. The
names of the towns and 'rivers arc all
done In gold characters, and '/the total
value, of ".thejabor aside from' its sc!en
tific interest isput at Â£160,000.\/This beau
tiful, map is 'a'.real.trluinphAof the Â«nld

cient and forgotten^ chef d'oeuvres, such
as.the "breast plate of cunning wwrk" de
scribed In the book of Exodus, with its
twelve -rows ;cf" precious s.tones accord*
ing to the names of the children of Israel.
Itvls ' certainly, most regrottablj that in
these, days 'of "so much jewelry we have
so; ; little goldsmlthing. In. fact, the" craft
of Berjvenuto Cellini and' of- the; Anglo r
Saxon monks who framed their ; missals

Pome one In apologizing- for our fcunaing
said that what we lacked in art we made
up in sentiment. The building U made
with a sort of vestibule, the open door
idea that this writer considered emble
matic of our hospitality. I am hoping that
the "bfghead" feature is not also emble
matic. A short time aÂ«ro the pupils o" the
Ecole des Beaux Arts wero asked to de
cide by vote which of the Exposition
buildings was the most successful from
the artist's point of view and which tho
greatest failure. For the most beauttrui
building I' believe the vote was almost a
tie between Italy and Belgium, but for thÂ»
ugliest the United States received a
unanimous vote.
I am curious to know what the princi
pality of Monaco is going to exhibit ia
this splendid building:. The only enterprise
In the country is the Monte Carlo c-ajik.
and how will it be represented for tha
edification of the visitcr! A roulctto tabla
where the player always won would cer
tainly be a unique and unrivaled attrac
tion, beside which even otir free Califor
nia raisins would pale Into lr.sigriUcanca.
I tried to extract a little' Information,
about the Monaco exhibit from one of
the attaches, 'but all to no avail. He
smiled a sphinxU&e smile and declared
that this must remain a mystery till the
opening day. I am sure that he was an
ancient croupier. Ilia manner of replying
to my questions was quite as if I had
blandly a?ked him to tell me the winning
number. This guess on my part. ! must
avow, required no depth of divination.
Every resident of ilocaco is or has been
or hopes to be a croupier. Even,- one eUe
wins and goes away or loses and kills
himself.
Those who work In high altitudes suf
fer not only from the rawfied air." but
from mountain toothache, Air. Hai'ner of
Zurich finds that all the cnglpeera and
workmen on the Jungfrau Railway, who
are obliged to remain a considcrab'3 tim*Â»
at altitudes or abcuit 2&X) rcetr^â a ml!a
and ,a halfâ above "the sea l*vc:. after
eight or ten days are seized w.th violent
pains in several teeth on one side of tha
Jaw. the gums ami cheeks on the same
Eldo becoming swollen. The teeth. are so
sensitive to pressure that mastication is
extremely painful. These symptoms in
crease In severity for three days, and
then gradually entirely disappear Tt
seems to be purely a phenomenon of ac- L
climatizatlon,. . for all newcomer t go^
through the complaint, and It appears
never to' recur.
THERE 13 a'grlm fascination In~visit
ing this Paris Exposition. Every
thing Is so uncertain and so insecure
that one grows to think himself a hero
for walking about Jin- the most ordinary
fashion, while to make the circuit in the
.electric tramway or to cross one of the
numerous bridges requires the most pro
, nounced recklessness and daring. Ono
â¢ feels that 'the individual who crosses Ni
agara, on a tightrope should begin to di
videjthe honors. The pleasure of having
-'escaped" after an afternoon at tho fair
Is worth traveling many miles to experi
Â¦_ence. Â« It renders tho bare fact'of being
Alive a' genuine delight and the possession
,-of unsmashed legs and arms a mo3t thrlll
â¢ Ing pleasure. Things arc simply being
thrown together in any way at all to pro :
duce an effect and to gather the^colns.'
The falling of the bridge two Sundays ago
t:when nine Iive3 .were racrlficed and- many
persons wounded has proven beneficial in
â¢ starting a few investigation?; still,: I have
ibeen advised 'by- some ojie who knows.
whereof he speaks to avoid the Crowded
days at the exposition., This person as
sures me that the structure's are far from
being- solid and substantial. It is now
said- in undertones that, in reality fifty
isix people were killed by the falling of
|the; bridge, but of course there Is no way
jof: corroborating nor of denying this ru
"'mor. The authorities aro doing every
thing possible to hush up the matter, and
will arrive 'at its height-- Some of the raises
that have been made on account of thÂ» ex
position are really very ridiculous. For
Instance, camphor < and quinine ..at . the
drugstores are more than twice as expen
sive as formerly. Candles have gone up
considerably; even cotton \dress good?,
linings, whalebones and things of that
description have taken exposition prices.
The blanchisseuse is quite as Independent
as if she owned the whole exposition, and
next week, they tell me, cab fares will bo
increased.
It is a frosty day, Indeed, when the
Paris cabman is left on any : of the good
thing3 that are going. He Is a thing en
tirely apart, this Paris "cocher." He is
unlike anything else that ever was cre
mated. He Is a king, an autocrat, a tyrant
and something of a hypnotist in the bar
gain. I sometimes flatter myself on not
being easily frightened; I am not of the
timid sort, but when a Paris "cocher"
asks me twice or three times the proper
fare I hasten to deliver it. He thrills me
with his imperialism. "Here it Is, most
mighty sir," I almost utter as 1 deliver
â¢what he asks. "Do I possess anything
else that you w r ould like? Perhaps my
jacket or my parasoL would be of some use
to' you!"
'The moment .that he has vanished
around the corner it^ occurs to me that i
should hava fought it out With him. "Well,
the next time I'll not be treated In that
fashion," I decla's cost vehemently, but
that are legitimate must never be seen;
It !Â» only the Illegitimate that is flaunted
carelessly before tho eyes of the world.
When monsieur is at home, dining re-
Bpectably with the lady who is.hls wife,
he bursts with fury because the passers
by loOk'in upon him, yet they may look
as long 'and as often as they please when
he dines upon the boulevard with ths
lady who is not his wife.
Sousa's band ia one of the attractions
of the exposition. There is a life and go
about it and a lack of/ "classicism," as
we have it in Europe, that is really deli
clous. It is like a cooling ice after a very
heavy dinner. After --all, there are more
people in the world who like "Home,
Sweet Home" and "The Last Rose of
Summer" than there are who like* Waft
ner. If they would only v "own up." But
they won't "own up" and of course it is
better In the cause of education that they
do not. Should Wagner cease to be the
fashion we should know very little about
him. The minority who are really inter
ested could never afford to keep the thing
going. I often think of what Mark Twain
said on a recent occasion, that Wagner's
music was "a good deal better than It
mounded.-. Now, it .is a comfort to know
that Sousa's music Is just as good as It
sounds. It is popular, breezy and cheery,
yet, thank heaven, we may say that we
like It without striking at once an Igno
ramus attitude. .
That the Americans are thick and nu
merous in town was quite evident the
other day at one "of the Sousa concerts.
Even If other people are not materializ-
most as mechanically as buttons. "Tis
true, of late years a few Parisian artists
have been trying to create a revival in
"the art of goldsmlthing and have met
with some success. Undoubtedly the Ex
position will addstimulua to this revival.
In the "Petit Palais" the Rctrospectlvo
Exhibition presents a delightful field for
study of this nature. There are the love
liest jewel caskets, headgear of lapis
lazuli and gold, necklaces and finger ring3
besides crucifixes, missals and. religious
objects of every description, all superb
examples of ancient or Renaissance gold
smithing. In this same exhibit are beau*
tifulold tapestries and rare Limbs* en
amels, the cathedrals of France having
sent, .their most cherished treasures.
Very few of tho foreign pavilions ara
yet open. In fact. Russia 13 the only im
portant country that* Is ready to recelva
visitors. The Â¦ aspect of these bulidlnga
conveys r.o Idea whatever of the relative
wealth and Importance of the countries.
Italy, that is probably the poorest nation
on the face of the earth, has the finest
pavilion; the tiny principality of Monaco
has a building' that should make England
blush, while such countries as Roumanla.
Finland and Hungary have been most
lavish in their expenditures. The United
States has distinguished herself by hav
ing the ugliest building in the whole con
cern. The architect has tried to put tho
"Washington Capitol into a very tiny
space, tho result being very grotesque.
The thing is all dome and really looks
Hke a little man with a very huse head.

the action in these few strong words:
"The Renting of Q Battery is another
instance cf how devotedly puns can be
served to save the situation for all arms.
Surrounded by a semi-circle of marksmen,
the gunners stood by their guns. Three
men were loading, laying and tiring a gun:

When the order came tor the guns to re
tire there were ten men and one omcer
able to stand upon their feet, and they
were not all unweunded. Seven guns and
a baggage train were lost, but honor wa3
saved."
The British army supply system Is based
en three principles-first, to obtain, as far
a* possible, food from the region of opera
tions: second, to establish* depots along
the llne.j of communication f ,<r feeding th^
troops in case the supply which the coun
try yields is not sufficient : third, to keep J"

as from the depots run short. g) A

food reserve, and Â£/' f ;_^._.

tag food of all kinds to the distributing
points * at Cape Town, East London
and Durban. It has so provided with
its food reserve and its emergency rations
that each army ccrps in the field is able
to operate for five days Independently of
its lines of communication.
The rerular daily rat'-on served out to
the British soldier consists of one pound
of fre?h meat, one and a fourth pounds of
bread and four ounces of sugar, coffee and
other trimming. The cooking la done by
the company. The emergency ration con
sists of preserved meat, vegetables and
biscuits, and in active service each man
carries an emergency ration of one day's
food, to be used only if all other sources
cf supply fail. For its Vead supply each
army corps depends almost entirely on its
field bakery, which forms an essential

As for rirtnk, that necessity of course
crrr.es chiefly from the country itself in
the shape of watf r. and engineers are pro

3In "Marshfleld the Observer." Egerton
Castle very ably Fustains the reputation
he made as the author of "The Pride of

short stories and In that respect differs
from his previous publications, he has lost
none of the originality and brllliar.cy that
characterizes his former works and made
them so popular. Thore are six stories.

something to the desire for patronage In

"Tbe Jury Trial of 1900."
Every Presidential election for years
past has been marked by the publication
of o large number of books and.pamph
lets discussing the issues of the time in
such forms as the writers deemed most
likely to attract readers and affect voters.
This i year is to be no exception to the
rule. Tho publication of such works has
already begun. One of the first Is an
c-laborate. volume of 294 pages entitled
"The Jury Trial of 1900." The author rep
resents the case of Bryan vs. McKinley
as being heard In the Court of Public
Opinion before Judge Levclhead. com
monly known as Uncle Sam. The action*
is brought to oust McKJoley from the

Important ethnological results was un
dertaken two. or three years ago by Hu
bert.Vos, the Dutch portrait painter, now
a naturalized American, namely, to paint
a series of types of the world's races. Mr.
Vos has already painted twenty or thirty
such portraits, and In an article on the
subject by Charles de Kay In the June
Century, four of them will be shown â Ha
waiian, Chinese, Japanese and East In
dian. In the difficult approach to some
of these types Mr. Vos has been assisted
by his wife, formerly the Princess Kaikl
lanl of Hawaii. The completed gallery Is
Intended for a museum.
The June number of McClure's Is par
ticularly strong and varied in its contents,
both as regards fiction and special arti
cles. President Kruger of the South Afri
can republic is portrayed in an acute char
acter study by F. Edmund Garrett, who
has had the advantage of personal contact
with the remarkable Boer leader and is
thoroughly familiar with his past career
find with the political history of the
Boers. Excellent portraits of Kruger and
his wife are Included. J. Lincoln Stef
fens of the Now York Commercial Adver
tiser relates some striking "incidents of
conflict" between Goverr.or Roosevelt and
iho party loaders, and considers whether
his first term as Governor has turned out
to be a successful experiment. A fully Il
lustrated article on the Cape Nome gold
fields, by William J. Lampton. describes
life In Nome City, which is "the largest
of its age In lhe world." and gives the
latest and exactest Information available
concerning the possibilities of this new
gold region, one that is much richer than
thÂ»s;world. The nobilityâ of family or of
wealthâ furnish attractive pictures, for
him who Tikes to. paint flowing draperies
and antique carvings and hot-house beau
- ty. The slums furnish the most glowing
opportunities j for melodramic climaxes:
climaxes of heroic burglars and disguised
* dukes. But the commonplace peopleâ the
ones who live out, dull lives In dull
honesty; the ones who never open a morn
ing paper to recognize their own pictures
therein, exploited on the strength of great
fame, great wealth or a great crime â of
these.- the people of neutral tint, the
world's browns and drabs, of these Fran
cols Coppee is an interpreter.
Above all, he can take this neutral
tinted material and give it positive, vivid
color. In his unostentatious manner, as
retiring as are the people he draws, he
has made the little stationer and the
cheap story-writer and the old tobacco
dealer real and vital and significantâ they
who would most likely tell you In all
modesty that they are the most insignih
cant people in life, and that their exit
would make not one whit difference.
The tales are of the quiet little hero
isms that go, for the most part, unsung.
They and Coppee are worthy of one an
other. -
It would not be fair to the author to
print blunt outlines of the stories. Given
in few words. It sounds like cheap senti
mentality that a poor young man should
â¢take upon himself the care of a feeble old
woman and a little child who have no
claim upon him. and that he should there
after, be a happier man and a more ef
fective writer. It is the author's sincerity
that makea such tales convincing, and it
can speak only for Itself.
A pathetic strain of humor runs throueh
ued in the June Truth; by a finely illus
trated article on John II. Dolph, animal
painter. The pictures are reproductions
from some of the artist's best work and

a full page in color from the painting by
Charles Graham. Among other Interest-

Â«7v? BOOK that will be received with
/lA\ open arms by the California col-
Jj \> lejre world in general and Stanford
enthusiasts in particular, is a lit
tle voluma of fiction by Charles K. Field
end Will H. Irwln, which has Just been
published under the title of "Stanford
Stories." As the name implies It is a
pen picture of life at the Leland Stanford
Jr. Universityâ the youngest In the sister
hood of higher institutionsâ and seen
through youthful college eyes the por
trnyal is a good one. Even from the view
point of the general reader, who has
never had the chance to breathe ' four
yparf" atmosphere of campus trials, trib
ulations and fun, the stories will not be
found wanting In interest, for they pos
tcss literary merit in their clever plots
and bright dialogues.
One fault is to be found, though not a
gravo one and probably one that will be
considered a merit by the student readers
of the book, and that is in the excessive
u?e of slang. Everybody knows that th*
college man uses mere slang than any
other individual in the world, barring not
even the powery boy â quite gentlemanly
rlang Â»t is. but nevertheless expressions
Strangely and wonderfully formed that
require an interpreter or a colloquial dic
tionary for the uninitiated to follow. In
a prefatory note it is explained: "It may
be. necessary to add that. In the endeavor
to present the actual life of the univer
sity it has seemed quite Inadvisable te
edit the conversation of the characters
from ihe standpoint cf the English purist.
Since, however, those readers who boggle
over slang could hardly be much Interest

merely to call attention to the point." AH
well and good. Let us forgive the "con
versation of the characters," but In the
words and descriptions of the author!
themselves there appear as many myster
ious colloquialisms as are put In the
mouths of the lay figures. This Is hardly
necessary and detracts from the dialogue
âit gives too much of a good thing. The
writers might at least let their own ob
servations go in plain Ehgllsh and culti
vate to a small extent the kind regard
of the purist- It cannot be true that
"those readers who boggle over slang
could hardly l>e much interested In the
undergraduate," for in these days of prac
tically free Instruction nearly every, man,
woman and child in the State Is interest
ed directly or indirectly In some under
graduateâsome sister, brother, cousin or
friend, who js taking a university course.
Beycnd this exception there Is none to
be taken. The writers have done what
they intended to do. given clever, bright,
snappy sketches of the inner college life,
the hard work, the fresh freshman, tho
charming co-ed, the fraternity initiations.
the class elections, the idolized footballer
and all with the proper glamor of college
smuke and college liquid refreshments,
the inspiring ".stein."
There are given thirteen short stories in
the bookâ possibly an unlucky number for
hoi pollol but a mascot for the college
man, to whom, outside of his conditions In
knotty studies, everything Is golden. The
text is lightened with four photogravures,
pleasing souvenirs of Stanford views,
which are reproduced upon this page.
The first story, under the caption of "A
Midwinter Madness." is full of vim and
ploas-.ant fun. It recounts an Incident of a
gice club trip. The desire of the first
mandolin to cut short his contract with
the club that h<* may bask in the light of

made a strong tug upon his heart-strings.

musicians suspect the seriousness of hla
malady, and explaining to the local phy
ician that he is Insane manage to have
him placed under strict surveillance,
greatly to the patient's disgust. The out
look seems blue for the lovelorn glee man.
but the tables are turned most unexpect
edly, and just as the reader thinks the
cause a forlorn one the fair one. with the
aid of a telephone, makes a happy rescue.
The discomfiture of the confident club
men returning to enjoy the fruits of their
counter-plot is very cleverly written.
An interesting description of fraternity
troubles in rushing the desirable freshman
to inorras-e their list of members Is con
tained in the story entitled "His Uncle's
Will." This was originally printed In the
Sequoia, with the title. "The Fate of
Freshman Hatch."
"The Initiation of Dromio" gives a very
funny account of a serious mistake on the
part of a Greek letter fraternity whose
members. In the out-of-door horseplay of
an initiation, got a young college profes
bor mixod with their candidate, owing to
a striking likeness between the two. and
proceed to put the unfortunate young man
through a series of athletic exercises, dis
covering their mistake only after they
had given him a cold plunge. The youth
fulness of some of Stanford's professors
lias oltcn been the subject of comment
and the source of many a college laugh
on account of the unsophisticated fresh
man taking him for a fellow-newcomer.
"The Substituted Full Back" is the
Ftror.gest stcry in the book. It has a
touch of the weird and metaphysical
mixed in v.-ith the flavor and vigor of
football talk that makes most Interesting
reading. The dramatic effect Is well
worked out and the sketch will be found
worthy in itself outside of its relation to
college affairs. It hinges on the death of
the favorite full back and captain of the
loam just prior to the Thanksgiving da>
fame with Berkeley and his remark to
the ooOese ccach that "I will come back

spells in ti.*Â» critical periods of practice
j>lay of suddenly seeming to be imbued
with the spirit of the dead man. The
wcirdness of it all is not overdrawn and,
lr. fact, ti cade to seem quite plausible.
The game Is won for Stanford just at
the crufi.-.l moment and under a veil of
fascinating mystery.
Two of th" sketches bring in as central
figures Sirs. Stanford and the late Senator
Stanford, showing well the students' ap
preciation of the founders of the institu

gives a picture of the hard-up graduate

of effecting a loan from the other â only
to :iad that they both would willingly
loan, but haven't a cent, and had hoped

students who enlisted In the First Cali

The conversation turned upon the

Jt is strange, almost impossible for Cal-
ifornlans to realize, that Dr. Shrady him
self considers the work that he has done
California as the most important of his
life. "I believe In the army of peace,"
he said. "A great general kills many
men, hence his greatness. Another per

by one word, and if he lose his own from
the effects of his labors people will merely
say 'He was much interested In science.' "

In speaking to Dr. Shrady he remarked
that in all of his twenty years of prac

It v.-as Dr. Shrady's connection with the
Grant affair which first brought him into
his greatest public notice.
He had been working at his hospital
surgery in Xcw York all one day, making
operations of importance, one after an
other, with rtiat finished mechanical case
and rapidity which no handiworker other
than the surgeon ever seems to achieve.
Among the audience of students and
practitioners who always attend at the
hospital to see the Instructive illustra

physician and surgeon of ordinarily suc
cessful practice.

In ftev Y<irk; one of them is George Fred
erick f-rcdy. Why has he risen to world
fame while- po many others, as he says,
as competent and learned as himself yet
work unnoticed in their placet;? There is
always an explanation for pre-eminence.
Usually it is gtnius. and that has been
correctly defir.ed as an Infinite capacity
man.
But there are peculiarities about George
Frederick Shrady which are striking. His
vitality and exuberant spirits are wonder
ful. After the trying, exciting experience
of chasing the black death through China
town all day. making investigations and
â¢writing reports through the evening, still
at midnijrht he was fresh and ready to
talk of ar.y subject but himself.
He is a man cf medium height, with an
unusually larjre headâ so large that his
hat drops over the ears of men with much
Inrger frames than his. Another charac
teristic is the peculiar suppleness and
power cf his hands, which he has a habit
of putting through various delsartean
movements as he speaks.
His fingers are spatulate to an unusual

for hard work. At the same time they

brother attempted to do so the hammer
flipped and struck hard enough to jar the
teeth of the young man who was trying
to Mow. The {run. being pointed at a crow
and fired, brought down the bird.
Dr. George Frederick Shrady is the per
son who was :it the business end of the
gun. and he still has a way of taking hold
of the dangerous end of things when cir

OF Arp^ca'S

The Secretary of the Treasury has a
very large directory of careless people â
of people who have money to burn or
otherwise destroy, and who appeal to him
for reimbursement. Uncle Sam is kind
enough to restore lost money when he is
satisfied that it is actually out <jf exis
tence, and the Treasury Department has
to look after this branch of his financial
affairs. Hardly a day passes that tha
Secretary is not appealed to to make good
money destroyed, and he often receive*,
remnants of bills, more or less recognis
able, with queer tales of how the work ctC
destruction was wrought. .
One of the latest applications was from
a Vermont farmer, who sent a mass of
remnants of bills that approached the
condition of pulp, and asked for $2S0 in
return, which, after some delay, ho re
ceived. He said he had very carefully
hidden the money under the rafters of his
barn, and somehow it had got into
the hay anch bran fed to one of his cows.
The cow was chewing the green feed
when Its nature wa3 discovered.
Another farmer from Kansas has sent
a lot of chopped bills that he says repre
sent $40. According to his story they were,
in the pocket of his vest that was fauns
on a feed cutter, and when it wa3 being
operated the corner of the vest that held
the money got between its knives and
with the money was torn in shreds. Tha
claim is now in process of adjustment.
A Boston man took from his pocket
what he says he. thought was a piece of
paper, and burned half of it in lighting
the gas. The gas light revealed the fact
that he had used a twenty dollar bill for
a lighter.
A'- Washington man, a couple of weeks
ago. went In person to the Secretary to>
get $33 for some badly mutilated bills that
his playful pup had been exercising with
.for an hour.
A "Wisconsin^ woman has sent a lot of
tinder that she says was once $00. Several
months ago she hid It in a stove pipe
hole, into which a pipe from a laundry
fire was recently placed. A3 the pipe rest
ed on the bills tinder was the result.
Another woman, this time in Indian-*
apolls, got $10 in greenbacks mixed with
greens she was preparing for dinner, and
boiled -them into an almost unrecogniz
able mass.
loving Philadelphia papa has asked
$20 for a few strips of greenish paper
and a score of pellets of the same mate

The facts had to be not only properly
found, but properly presented lest an
ambiguous word or sentence miscon
strued might ring the alarm which would
cause as much injury as a pestilence.
The whole situation bristled with diffl-Â»
cultles. There were the jealousies of dif
ferent clashing interests which stood in
the way of a fair investigation. Federal
and local power were opposed, race waa
against rarce -and even political differences
were all intruded upon the one vital ques
tion. Have we the plague?"
That question has been answered. Tha
imprisonment of 30,000 people ha3 been
determined fairly and satisfactorily and
a. burden has been lifted from the mind of,
apprehensive millions.
Dr. Shrady has had a busy life. Ha has
been regularly acting as surgeon for half
a dozen great hospitals; has been editor
of two medical papers of world-wide cir
culation. To hold within the touch of
your hand the life of a wor!d-loved hero,
with the eyes of the world upon you, and
on your judgment perhaps depending the.
thread of that life; to do that again and
again, and then come out a cheerful,
bashful person, with a mind fresh and
Jolly as a boy's, that shows a man both
strong and elastic. The fact of his being
delegated to settle the great plague ques
tion, which agitated the Atlantic States
far more than San Francisco, was as
much because of his fearless manner of
expressing his opinion as of his ability as
a pathologist.

The three women waited, oppressed by
the walls of ' this house of wretchedness.
They regarded *vith unobservant eyes the
panels of the parlor, -decorated with mu
nicipal-lithographs, and the mantelpiece,
upon which a bu&t of the Republique.dis
played Its profile of Ceres crowned .with
tho Phrygian bonnet. At; twenty-five

With the meek air of a schoolgirl she
kissed the three women. Daisy pressed
her to her ' heart for -several moments.
Pirnitz and Frederique, who had not seen
her since the evening - of the ; crime," felt
a great lump of pity. rise in their throats.

"Menâ men have tyrannized over women
for. centuries!.* We must be emancipated!

"Forgive me! Forgive me! I am so

there are a hundred ways of doing good,

Daisy bowed her head; but d{d not reply.
Frederique and Pirnitz realized that still
another was lost to the cause of feminine
emancipation. Lovo for a particularly
dear human being had stolen* her from
humanity.
"Let us go," said Pirnitz.
She went out first with Frederique.
Daisy followed them, humble and con
fused, astonished with herself to have

He appeared quite satisfied with the so-1
lution no had found, and his eyes sought!
some token of approval. j
"Always diplomacy, policy, intrigue!"
thought Frederique. "Is It not possible to
be a useful social influence witnout being
hampered by all that? However, I must
be Kntisfied if justice be done!"
"1 believe 1 am safe In assuring you that
the matter'will be dealt with to my satis
faction." continued M. d'l'bzac. "If nec
essary the inquiry can be reopened in or
der to arrive at a decision that she is Ir
responsible. Only. I pray you, not a word
of my Intervention in the affair!"
There was anxiety, nlmost fear, in the
Judge's attitude as he spoke.
"I should have liked to take the good
news to Germnine. Soubize, with Daisy
Craggs and Pirnitz, at once," sal,l the
girl. "Could I ask for three permits to
see her at St. Lazare? I will ho very dis
creet." she added. "I will not say who
has given me the encouraging assurance."
She read a shaÂ«ie of displeasure upon
the Judge's frowning brow, but he yield
ed, and wrote a. few words on a slip of
paper, which he put in an envelope and
addressed.
"Here is a note for M. Fournler, <he
Juge d'Instruction who has charge ,of the
matter." he said, handing tha letter to"

necessary permission to visit the prisoner.

She. did not even reply; his Insistence ir
ritated her. She simply said:
"Thank you. sir."
She arose, and M. d'Ubzac rose also. _â¢ Â¦
"Shall I not see you again?" he asked,
as though In spile of himself.
"I do not think so." replied Frederiquo.
A spasm of suffering so violent contract
ed the President's face that the girl was
moved to pity.
"I will remember, however," she said,
"in case I should have any Injustice to
point out to you, that I" am welcome
here."
They walked together toward the door
of the room. The father and daughter
were of the same height. Frederique re

tenderness overwhelmed her, .an instinct
that was. so to speak, physical, a desire
to fling her aims around his neck and

at that moment she would have fallen in

control oÂ£ himself, realizing that he was
face to face withÂ«a strong willâ these
phases of their first meeting wore con
tained In a few seennris. as are almost all
the powerful emotions of the human soul.
Frederique imposed what she had decided
ânamely, that M. d'l'bzac should not be
the first to speak. It was she who said:
"M. le Prf."ldÂ«?nt. I have come to ap
peal to your sense of equity in favor of an
Innocent woman."
The Judge, warned and now master of
himself, replied:
"Sit down, mademoiselle."
Prederique sat down, and clearly, rather
briefly, but without omitting any details,
like some one Â«ure that the time would
not be grudged her. sho explained that
, Fhe had come to plead the cause of Ger
maine Soublze. who was in danger of be
ing sent before a jury. She did not aak
that Justice should spnre the guilty, but
she hoped to enlighten by her positive
facts the mind of one of the highest judi
cial authoritle5.
She related Germaine's past ami that of

Duyvecke. v.ho refused to give up her

cupied the apostle's o!Â»i room. Daisy had
established her little bed in a small room

CHAPTER II.
By dint of thinking about the Interview
with the Present dTbzac which her
conscience imposed upon her as a duty.
Frederique had gradually arranged all its
details In advance. It was necessary
ebove all that her womanly dignity, con
sidered by Pirnitz and herself as intangi
lile, should not be touchÂ«d by the step
Fhe was poing to take. The idea that first
occurred to hÂ«r â to appeal to the private
Feoretarv â was therefore dismissed.
Would it not be to accept in a certain
decree the method proposed by M. d'Ub
zac to Imitate h'.s example and respect
eoe'al and political conventions? Freder
ique also gave up all id*-a of writing to
the president. With a personage of such
Importance it is never certain that letter*
may not be opcr.ed by an intermediary,
end finally at no price would she call upon
him xl his jrlvatt' residence and risk
meeting l:!s wife. She was, therefore,
compelled to see him at the Palais de
Justice without notifying him cf her visit
beforehand.
The morning cf the day after Fred^r
iQOe'fl return t<"> Paris from her journey
to PoudenatP. Pirnitz nccompnnied the
jour.s girl as far as the broad marble
ttaircacc leading up to the Ualerie de
Hurlav. It was barely half-past 10, and
Frederique. at the foot of her Mount Ca
valry, tre.mbl'-d with t-motion.
"Oh. Remains." she said. Brippintf her
companion's arm. "must I really make
this appeal? No torture could be more
terrible."
"I know that the trial Is a harsh one."
replied the aiK)Ptie. "Any one else would
ha.ve rÂ«-fus*-d even to consider it. Hut
Flnee you have had jÂ«uch an Inspiration
vou have no right to try to avoid It. So
be firm. Tfclnk of the iniquity of a pos
sible eon-ScTnnation for Germaine, and
that you may prevent It."
"I will <5o v.-hat I ougrht to do," said
Fredrrlque. "Thank you."
"I am going to join Daisy at tho law
yer'* \o arrange about the guarantee,"
replied Pirr.itz. "Where shall i meet you
ajja.:n. and v.hen?" . - â¢-Â¦â¢
"trupp<Â»e we say in the Gal*riÂ« de Har
lay? Wait for me there with Daisy if you
r.re. free before I am, which is very proba
ble. In case we have any good news wo
can all go with It to Germaine at once."
"Very pood; in the Galerie <ie Harlay
25 Foofi as pos5ible. Re brave!"
She pressed her hand. Krederfque went
â¢up the marble steps, entered the palace
and turned to tho left through the door
decorated with dope" heads, vlth the
Â¦words "Cour <ie Cassation" above It.
Thrre fho !n=VÂ«J an usher If she could see

"It Is hi* roooptlon day," replied the
man, "but M. le President only arrives at
11 o'clock or hr.lf-^ast."
"Can 1 wait for h:m here?"
"It you wiÂ«h."
He languidly or>er.ed the door of a red
carpeted waiting room, furnished with red
velvet covered chairB. Frederique Bat
down. A few moments later the fame,
rnan came back with a written form, upon
which she wrote her name. 2.111c. Kreder-
Ique LÂ«Â»p::y-Surier. in tho first blank.
Chief President d'Ubxac h?d Introduced
this ministerial formality at the Palais de

"Oh! that** not certain." rrnlied the

In the wnltlng; room of an Important func-
Half-past 10. 11 o'clock rang out. Sev
eral other visitors came in; two ladles In
drop mourning: a gentleman, evidently a
lawyer, with side whisker* and clean
shaven upper lip. a very noisy personage
Â¦who talked loudly, and whom the usher
knew nnd called respectfully "M. le 8cn
ctei;r." The two ladlw In mourning were
absorbed in a whispered conversation Rnd
paid no attention to what was passing
around them, and the lawyer read the
newspapers, of which he had a" packet In
the pocket of his overcoat. The Senator,
after striding noisily backward and for
ward in the little room, and nearly chok
ing in a fit of coughing, admired his com
mercial traveler's countenance in the. mir
ror, and then Fat down In front of Fred
erique and tried to attract the noble, pen
sive gaze of the young girl.
"Mile. Frederique Legay-Surier!"
It was the usher who uttered the name,
opening the d^>or whtch led by a little cor
ridor to the Chief President's office. And
the way â¢>'.Â« voice accentuated the sylla
bles prove i -i Â¦rice his deference, surprise
ond also vÂ«Â« .measure he felt in astonish
ing the public.
Frederique was not surprised. She had
foreseen that M. d'Ubzac wtfuld receive
her as soon as he read her name. She
followed the usher. A dim corridor sepa
rated the waiting-room from the presi
dential office. During the. few seconds
that it took her to traverse it she felt a
little wave of tenderness rising In her
heart and stifled It with a violent effort.
But this tender emotion was not aroused
by the man to whom she owed her exist
ence, whom she was going to see for the
first time. It rose from the depths of her
memory, nnd surrounded poor Christine's
memoryâ Christine, victim of this man.
The usher, drawing back at the door
way, announced her:
"Mile. Frederique Lepay-Surler!"
Frederique was in a large room, lighted
by two high windows, ornamented with

sitting- behind c table desk covered with
documents she saw a personage in a well
cut though severe frock morning coat,
who arose as she entered. As in all the
serious moments of her life, she Instinct

"She has left us. She has gone to some
friends in England with whom we lived
formerly. I suppose that she will marry

"And you?" Â¦ ,

Craggs at No. 21 Rue de la Sourdiere."
. She gave the address without the
slightest quiver in her voice. But the
President was so moved when he heard It
that he had to lean back in his armchair.
Froderique felt that he was going to speak
of forbidden topics, that he had been af
fected by her visit. There was a tragical
silence, during which, overwhelmed and
afraid- of yielding if she witnessed her
father's emotion, she fixed her gaze obsti
nately upon one of the portraits of men in
red rubes and ermine hanging on the wall.
Finally she resumed, with sufficient firm
ness:
"M. le President, may I rely upon your
support in the work of justice which
touches mo so deeply?"
"I promise you to do all I possibly can,"
replied M. d'Ubzac in a very low. voice,
"and I have some reason to believe that
I shall succeed. It is manifest that the
young girl is worthy of interestâ is very
interesting.'"
"May I ask how your influence will be
exercised?"
"It is impossible to act directly upon the
Juge d'Instruction. It would be a clum
sy and compromising step to take. You
understand? But the matter can be ar
ranged. I will appeal to the Procureur
General, who will make his wishes known
to the Juge through the Procureur de la
Republique. In this Way no criticism is
her frame. Her past life 'appeared to her
like a desert, and she felt, disgust for the
future. She gave way tq her grief,' and
then a sudden thought made her shudder
and stagger upright. \
"Great _heavens! If he 1 come out! IC
he see me!" \
The fear of being surprised there by her
father, whom she divined was still stand-
Ing immobile behind the closed door of
his office, restored her strength again.
She crossed the red cartoeted waiting
room, now full of people, and the vesti
bule, where the usher wasi sitting. He
rose to his feet hurriedly, astonished not
to have hÂ»ard the electric' bell ring as
usual to warn him that a visit was at an
end, and conducted Frederique respect
fully to the Galerle de Harlay.
â¢ The formalities that had to be gone
through with the Juge. M. Foumier, to
obtain permission to visit Germaine re
lieved the young girl's nerevs. She found
no difficulty in the matter, though it de
manded more than half an hour. When
she returned to the Galerle de Harlay
with three permissions she found Daisy
and Pirnitz sitting on a bench. She ran
to them In a burst of Joy: "Germaine is
saved!"
â¢ Daisy, palo with emotion under her
ruddy complexion, seized Frederique's
hand and kissed it. She was ignorant of
Frederique's filial relations to the Presi
dent, d'l'bzac. and attributed her rejoic
ing to the success of her efforts. But
Pirnitz, from whom her disciple's heart
had no secrets, understood that the girl
had triumphed because she had supported
the trial with her will and dignity Intact.
"I was sure of it," she whispered, while
thiÂ» Irish woman was hailing a cab. "You
could not be vanquished. But the trial
was necessary; it threatened you sooner
.or later. Now you are confirmed."
Confirmed? Frederique had no time to
ask - Plrnitz . for an explanation of the
word, for Daisy returned with the cab.
But while they were rolling along to
gether toward the St. Lazare prison,
Daisy chattering like a mad woman, she
thought over the apostle's word. She
realized that after the destruction of the
work and Leu's flight Pirnitz had dreaded
for her favorite a possible return to her
family. Mme. d'Ubzac was known to be
n nonentity dominated by her husband.
The advanced ideas affected by the Presi
dent-Senator could easily ha"ve fitted in
with a rather theatrical legitimization of
his daughter. Who knows? Fredertque
porhaps ran the risk of being torn from
the feminist cause.
"Pirnitz was right," she thought. "This
trial was necessary. â¢ I feel that I am now
confirmed."
It wns nearly 2 o'clock when they
reached tho_nrison. Upon presentation of
one of M. Fournier's cards, and their
three authorizations great consideration
was shown them. They were led to a
parlor upon the door of which the word
"private" was printed on an enameled
plate.
without petulance â In fact, too calm.
They asked her about her health. /
"Oh, I am quite well," she replied. I
aro well cared for here. I lack nothing.
But my illness was very long! -You can
not imagine how I suffered with my head.
They put cataplasms on my back, made
me drink all sorts of Infusions, but I only
said to them: 'Take my headache away,
I pray you.' I never thought that one
could have a headache for so long."
"And you no longer suffer now, dear
Germaine?" asked Pirnitz.
"No, I have only a feeling as though my
brain were frozenâ do you understand? It
seems to me as though behind my fore
head there were a heavy, cold, insensible
mass. ' It is very tiresome. I do not be
lieve I shall ever be able to work again,
but it may disappear in time."
Sitting: on the edge of a chair, like a
model pupil, she uttered these ordinary
phrases with an air that was at once re
signed and indifferent. Pirnitz and Fred
erique exchanged a glance of consterna
tion. Poor Daisy became red in the face
with her efforts to keep back her tears.
"Can I tell her the- result of Freder
ique's appeal?" Pirnitz asked the Irish
woman in a low tone.
"You may try," said Daisy. "As soon
as I speak to her of what she has done
she begins to wander in her speech."
"We bring you some good news, Ger
maine," said the apostle.
"Ah! What is it?"
"You will not be sent before the Cham
bre dea Mises in Accusation. In all
probability you will be set at liberty very
soon."
Germaine watched Pirnitz attentively
and did not appear .to have heard. Daisy
waited anxiously for what she was going
to say. -
"Are you not happy, Germaine." con
tinued Pirnitz, "to hear the news?" It is
Fed! who has obtained this favor for
you."
The prisoner appeared to make an ef
fort to collect all her understanding. She
looked at Daisy, Pirnitz and Frederique.
one after the other. Then she said in a
timid, hesitating voice:
"is It time for my class to begin soon?"
Daisy could not restrain her tears. Pir
nitz and Frederique felt the curious ter
ror that moves humanity, to its very
foundation at the first delirious words of
some beloved being whom one has known
full of reason and intelligence.
Suddenly Germaine saw that Daisy was
weeping. She left her chair, flung her
arms around the Irish woman's neck and
kissed her several times.

wants of their home, gave a lesson of aa
hour and a half in the afternoon to a
young girl studying for her diploma, the
daughter of a big furniture dealer m tho
Rue Lafayette, who often employed
Remineau.
Nothing had interrupted the complete
harmony of the pair since their marriage.
Remineau still remained in complete ser
vitude to Duyvecke. whom he regarded
with an almost religious adoration; and
Duyvecke â attracted at first by tha
somewhat clumsy kindness of the sculp
tor and by the pseudo-maternity which
attracted her toward little Gastonâ as the
simple outcome of her kindness and
purity of heart and of her well balanced
senses, had insensibly begun to love Re
mineau. The good fellow's caresses tran
quilized the vague aspirations and unde
fined desires that her girlish innocence
had Ignored.
The evening of the day that Frederique,
Pirnitz and Daisy had vi3ited the St. La
zare prison the Irish woman was the first
to arrive at the Remineaus', about 7
o'clock. She had been to see Professor
Buchardon in the afternoon and had se
cured nis promise that he would prevent
the incarceration of Germaine in a mad
house when she was liberated from prison.
A few moments later Frederique and Pir
nitz came in together from the Rue de ia
Sourdiere. They found Daisy in the par
lor with Duyvecke and little Gaston.
Remineau, who had been working late,
was finishing dressing.
"Ho is making himself handsome for
you," said the pretty Fleming, laughing
ly. "You will see in a few moments."
As Frederique and Romaine, sitting In
the Louis XV salon, for which Remineau
had carved the suit of furniture, were ad
miring the grace and taste displayed in
every detail, little Gaston, completely^ re
covered now that his "Mamma yecke" no
longer left him. drew near Frederique and
said timidly, almost in a whisper:
"Madame, is the other pretty lady not
coming also?" "
The "other pretty lady" was Lea. Fred
erique's heart was pierced by this inno
cent reawakening of a pain to which she
had refused to yield, or which she had
even refused to think. She kissed the
"No, dearest. The pretty lady that you
mean is no longer here with us. She will
never come back again."
"Ah," said the little one, pensively,

dared not scold the child, who had meant
no harm, but a painful silence followed
Frederique's answer. Luckily. Remineau
appeared almost Immediately â a Remi
neau transformed by love and conjugal
attention, a Remineau almost elegant,
with hands, hair and beard well cared
for, wearing fine starched linen and a suit
of blue serge fairly correctly cot, though
without any attempt at fashion. Fred
erique surprised the glance, at once eager
and grateful, that Duyvecke gave him
while he was greeting their visitors.
"Pirnitz was right." she thought. "This
fetichllke attachment of the wife for her
husband will long be the law for the best
among women. How many Duyveckes
are there In a hundred young girls? And
yet Duyvecke. who was not attached to
Remineau before marriage, who even
dominated him then, ia now the loving
slave of one of the most ordinary of n^n,
a man who is neither handsome nor intel
ligent, nor refined; simply an honest fel
low! Oh! what a difficult task it is to
free slaves who love their chains:"
While Frederique was meditating thus.
Remineau, who professed a sort of wor
ship for her. according to Duyvecke. wa3
making a very far fetched compliment
rather awkwardly about the honor she did
them in coming to see them, about thÂ«
respectful recollection they retained of
her, and as he became horribly contused
his wife came to his rescue prettily, tak
ing him by the arm.
"Come. Rem. don't be afraid. If you
only knew how sincerely he thinks what
he finds so difficult to say. Mile. Fred
erique! Not a single day passes that we
do not speak of you. You and Mile. Ro
malne are almost our patron saints. A
very little more and we should pray to
you!"
The servant, another Fleming' from
Hazebrouck. one of Duyvecke's foster sis
ters, and who seemed, being fair, with
ashen hair, a heavy, clumsy copy of her
mistress, opened the door of the dining
room and said:
"The dinner is ready. Duyvecke!'
The dining room was small, comfortable
ar.d prettily furnished, like all the other
rooms. When they were in their places
tho warmth of the air, the light of the
big hanging lamp, reflected by the shin
ing pottery and cutlery, the odor of the
succulent dishes cunningly prepared by
Duyvecke and her foster sister Gudule,
the true friendship that united them, gave
Frederique a feeling of comfort and secu
rity. How long it was since she had been
welcomed thus by friends since she had
&at at a table except in the school refec
tory! Oh, a long time! Never since the
days spent In Appletree Yard, for she
could not count the curious meals taken
at Poudenats with Sister Odile. Apple
tree Yard! Yes, It was suddenly brought
to Frederique's memory with startling
clearness, and the despotic memory of the
senses recalled to her another meal at
that very hcur in Tir.ka's dining room,
with rich food and bright lights shining
upon the white linen, crystal and silver
plate! All the sweetness of that fraternal
period, long vanished, recurred to her like
a perfume conserved intact in a closed
casket.
"Lea ha3 gone back to that happiness."
she thought. "Perhaps at this very ln-
Btant she is talking to Georg and Tinka."
Her gaze encountered that of Pirnitz,
and as they had now been drawn so close
that for one another their thoughts were

tle comfort, and received It.
In the meantime Duyvecke. animated by
the pleasure of her .reception, told of the
happiness and cares of her life; how, after
having stopped In the Rue Cujas to nurse
little Gaston, after having written the let
ter to Pirnitz that decided her fate by
closing: to her .nil chance of retreat, she
had fallen victim to a violent despair for
several days. And as she could not wreak
her bad temper upon Gaston. who waa
"really too good, dear little fellow." it was
honest Remineau who received It all.
"Ah! How I scolded him and behaved
toward him for a fortnight! It was ter
rible, wasn't it. Remi?"
Remineau. who was gravely disposing or
a second plate of soup, a stiffly starched
serviette protecting the lapel of his coat
like a buckler, laughed mischievously,
and replied:
"You see. she wanted to disgust me
with the Idea of having her for a wife!
But I had seen her and known her for
more than four years, and she had al

thought: 'Have patience. Reml. and don't

a sort of momentary illness. Duyvecke
cannot fail to become the real Duyvecke

His big. protruding eyes, sparkling: like
black diamonds, looked at his wife lov

of tenderness.
"I remember the day Papa and Mamma

man reached into his pocket and tlshed
out a new silver dollar. These were
thrown into a pile on a table and turned
over to Captain Llcyd as a fund_to pay

nothing but silver on his journey and to

the Ingenuity and tasto of the owner how

ordinary farm wagon fitted with oak

conveniences, in the wagon will be a

These wagons will likely be provisioned

until the convention is ever ami home is

Journey will be practically nothing. From
Oklahoma to Kansas City Is about 3W
Â¦miles. Rnilroad pns?cnger rates are 3
cents a mile in that country and It is not
likely that they will be reduced. Thus
the Oklahoma delegate or visitor coming'
a distance of 3'X> milts would have ta
spend about $20 for his passage and almost
as much as that in hotel bills In Kansas
City. If he go*s by wagon he can take
his family along without any additional
cost. lie and Ills family and team will
consume no more food on the road than
they would at home. The journey to Kan

A farm team can make about twenty
five miles a day for ten days on the^level
prairie roads, and after a rest of three or
four days in Kansas City be ready to go
the same salt again on the return trip.
A Journey by wagon from the adjoining
States to Kansas City will be regarded
much in the light of a picnic by these peo
ple. Wagon Journeying is a popular way
of spending summer vacations in the
West. Parties go from Kansas City down
into Arkansas. Oklahoma or the Indim
Territory in wagons fitted for the pur

th*eir holiday is ended. Sometimes, a cara

wayside.

Ka:.sas City. A great number of the dele

there ir. Pullman sleeping cars or e\en In
the ordinary day coaches, will start for
Kansas City many days or works before

stream across the prairie in canvas cov
ered wajroMF. many bearing on their sides
the legend "16 to 1."
Never before have delegates to a great
party gathering for the nomination of a
Presidential candidate son* to the meet
ing place :n such primitive style as this.
Andrew Jackson was nominated at a con
vention where there was a considerable
affectation of simplicity but little real
poverty. Mary of the delegates rode there
on horseback. Bat there were gentlemen
ridir.s bloodc-d animals, carrying silver
flasks of old whisky, and many of them
with "money to burn" at the wayside
'.:ms wh^re they stopped and indulged In
p u:r.cs of chance.
Far different are the men now prepar
ing "prairie schooners" In Missouri. Okla
homa, Kansas. Nebraska. Colorado and
Arkansas. They are determined to show
the convention what real democracy is.
according to their light. On* of the
schemes for doing this Is to camp out in
Kansas City and live In the "prairie
schooner" instead of in the hotels during
â¢he convention. One Western leader has
stated that this will be a stronger pro
test against plutocracy than any of the
r pooches made at the convention, and that
in seeing these hardy sons of toil actually
lirl&K on IP cents a day, too poor even to
Btop at a hotel, although representing
thousands of taxpayers, the Eastern dele
pates will have forcibly brought home to
t!.Â«rn who are really "the people."
It is likewise estimated that, aside from
the delegates from all over the neighbor-
Ing country who will flock to the conven
tion in "prairie schooners," many hun
dreds of spectators will likewise adopt
this extraordinary means of visiting the
city. Of course, the groat reason why
nothing like this has ever before been
witnessed is that this yeaf, for the first
time in history, a national eoriVention of
one of the two great parties will be held
west of the Mississippi. It would have
been impossible for "prairie schooner"
c>;< (rates to go to the conventions at St.
Louis, Chicago or Cincinnati. Many peo
ple in "blc-eding Kansas" and the adjoin
ing States and Territories are now rejoic
ing at the opportunity presented to them
of giving "the East" a practical object
lesson in modern local conditions.
There is in Western Kansas what Is
known as the "short grass country," so
called from the short, curly buffalo grass
that grows there. This is the country of
droughts, hot winds, dtserted towns ond
burst booms.
If a man can live In the "short grass
country" he is sturdy Indeed. Some men
do live in it and prohptr in a way. and
these will be part of the "prairie
6chooner" delegation.
Conditions are exceedingly hard in the
"short grass country" and men become
uncustomed to hard fÂ«re and harder
journeys. A silver dollar looks pretty big
out there and a man will endure consid
erable hardship before he will spend ona
for purely physical comtort. There people
are accustomed to Ion? wagon journeys
and make them with less discomfort than
many a pampered cily man would In a
day coach on a slow train. For years
they have have been accustomed to go
about the country from one State to an
other or from county to county, as crops
failed or wasons were bad. They loaded
their possessions lrlo wagons and
"trekked" across the prairies. When they
found a new locality that suited them
they hired a farm, planted their seed
and worked the farm until another bad
crop came. Then they packed again and
moved on. Thcee In the West are called
"movere." "Moving" has become a habit
with them.
llany of the men who have become more
or less prominent In Oklahoma politics
went there from Kanras In a "mover's
wapon." as the modern prairie schooner is
called in that country. Arkansas and
Southern Missourt-the Oxark Mountain
folkâ rude, proud and .is full of fight and
radical views as their mountain brethren
cf Kentucky, or the Carolinas. are famous
"movers" elib, and their religion Is "free
silver."
The farmer delegates of Colorado and
Western Nebraska may have "moved" at
some time from Kansas, Oklahoma or Ar
kansas, flitting: until they found a con
genial eoA and prosperity. These folk,
urrd to traveling the road In wagons,
will be the "prairie schooner" delegates
tind visitors.
It. is not to be supposed that all those
who journey to Kansas City In July la

Truxtun Beale holds that tbÂ© evil ef
fects of hot climates on the white man
are being overcome by science. Hereto
fore he has bad to labor hard, and thus
reduce hl3 vitality, but now the rapidly
increasing labor-saving machinery is sav
ing him much muscular labor and short
ening his hours of work. Then clothing
and housing and drainage and all sanita
tion have been greatly improved, and
proper ventilation and artificial ice have
come to lessen the detrimental influences
of the climate. Mr. Beale cites the many
cases of the Chinese adapting themselves
to all climates.
The Philadelphia Medical Journal, not
falling Into line with this argument, says:
"No mechanical contrivance for perform
ing labor Is likely to be devised that will
operate without human guidance, and it
such machinery Is operated by steam,
gas, or electricity, additlorial heat mu-*t
be generated somewhere. It Is as much
the direct rays of the sun as the work
that kills by sunstroke; this is evident
. from the large number of teamsters who
are affected during any unusually hot
days in summer in our large cities.
"It Is improbable that the poor will ever
be able to profit much by artificial Ice or
cooling apparatus, and even if they could
afford It this would necessitate some one
to work in intense heat to manage thÂ©
power needed to run such a plant.
"The Chinese coolie can hardly be com
pared with the white working man. ' In
the first place he Is not a white man, and
furthermore centuries of life liko pack
horses have jtiven these men many of the
characteristics of beasts. Then, asaln,
the heat and moisture of the tropic3 are
most favorable to germ life, and unless
some means is discovered (which is very
unlikely) that will destroy bacterial life
without injuring other forms of life, thÂ©
problem of combating disease In thÂ©
tropics will always be a difficult one. No
doubt conditions in the tropics will bÂ©

From the pen of a writer less gtfted]
than Daudet "Sapho" would have been
base, vile, defiling. Regarded purely as a

Then" the calcium light man gets roast

cium Miss Roberts shouts: "You girl
there, stand back and let the light shine
on me. Now, here, you man, does the
light shine all over me? Mr. Morrison,
what are you doing? Why don't you tell
me? Are the lights on me? Here, some
of you people take down that tree. How
can I stand here with that palm leaf
tickling me in the back? Now back to
'Down with Venus and up with Sapho/
and, while the lights are down somebody
remove that tree."
Again the scene is rehearsed, this time
with the offensive tree removed while the
lights are down. Too bad, for that trea
was the only thing in the show that
tickled Miss Roberts.
Then came the couch scene. . "k.
"This will not do." paid Sapho, as she
sat bolt upright on the couch. "You peo
ple go farther down stage. I want the
people in the boxes to see me.' You girl
there get out of my line. You are keeping
the people in .the right box from" seeing
me," and the pcor inoffensive little girl
skulked down si age a few steps to clear
the line of vision from the boxes.
"There; how's that? Can everybody see
me? Mr. Morrison, Morrison, Morrison,
where are you?" shouted Sapho in a voice
that bounced over the empty orchestra
chairs out Into the desertedstreet; "bank
ed" against the Orphcum and on the,re
bound caught Mr. Morrison in the. lobby
of the Alcazar.
"Where have you been? Get over into
one of the boxes and se,e if everybody can
Bee mo." Mr. Morrison "got" and re
ported, and then came back to the lobby
to explain that Miss Roberts had. had two
performances that day and. was very tired
and nervous./ There was no need Â¦ to ex
plain the latter. It was/a'' self-evident
fac^. Also that she was very, much out
of temper. Anybody can keep ' temper
when surroundings are conducive, but
"there arc times that try men's souls.'* ;if
the author of that had ever seen Miss
Roberts at' rehearsal he would have writ
ten,. "There arc stars that try; managers'
souls." The most placid person '.during
the rehearsal was- Mark Thall v Perhaps
it>was because Sapho thrcatened;at one
time to "put the play in my. pocket and
there will be no performance; to-night."
In just what pocket of her Sapho gown
Miss Roberts would put the play she did
not explain, but stars do not have to ex-
plain.
Then came the incident that nearly
broke up the "rbow." Mr. Thall wanted
a flash light of the "stairway scene."
The camera was all in plaeo, the powder"
ready and In leas than one second it would
be over. Miss Roberts saw her chance
for.'a rehearsal of lines not in the piay.
She raved and stamped and said "things."
"There'll be no photo of the stairway
scene," she shouted, and there wasn't.
Curious how infectious temper is. In one
hour Miss Roberts had everybody keyed
up to a state of exejtement and bad tem
per. At 3 o'clock she called for coffee.
"Mr. Morrison, get me some cofree at
once. I cannot go on any further without
coffee."
Then Lewis started on the hunt for cof
fee. There wasn't a chorus girl in the
house who couldn't have found gallons of
coffee Inside of five minutes, but none
could tell Mr. Morrison where he could
tind anyâ not even if Sapho did want it.
Surprising how forgetful people can be at
times. One hour later Sapho still had a
coffee thirst and the rehearsal closed be
cause Mr. Morrison could find no coffee in
San Francisco.
What a Critic
Has to Say
WHEN* Daudet wrote "Sapho" for
the^ French people he directed hl3
rare analytical power to probe
and expose huma*n weakness as
dispassionately as a great surgeon intro
duces his scalpel 'Into human flesh. He
did not create Its main characters as
first eccrc ret. Meantime the chorus
minpled with the principals and overran
the Etas* out into the orchestra seats, the
dress' circle and lobby, while Florence
Roberts seemed to be devoting her time
mostly to adjusting her Sapho crown and
workinp herself into a furious temper.
3-<ewis Morrison danced attendance, and
only pot himself severely sat upon until
fce looked taller and thinner, grayer and
more worried than ever, for the utar of
"Sapho" is surely his master.

time and time again, until the stage di

the rehearsal is on. All poes well until

trouble begins.

I was sitting In the store of an Indian

Joullin is a native-born San Fran
ciscan and that the Minister in
awarding him the decoration par
ticularly dzcclt upon the fact that
he was "ctrangcr" is much to the
credit of California. Fleeing for
his life fzco years ago to escape
vengeance of savage Penitentes for
making sketches of their secret
funeral ceremonies, Jiozi' Amcdce
Joullin is gathering 'glory abroad
as a rcco<+:ition of his meritorious
paintings.
Art is long, for it has a long
road to travel. Ainedee Joiillin has
traveled that road, and literally
over thorny paths while he was in
Old and New Mexico, sketching
the ferocious Zunis, who suppose
that they are losing part of their
substance or at least their astral
forms when they sec their doppcl
gangcrs en canvas or paper.
His most exciting adventure of
all the wild year that he spent on
the desert and through the Zuni
Mountains zvas wlicn he zvatched
a funeral of the Penitentes. Many
stories of the Penitentes have been
told, but fczv have seen their rites,
and so far as knozvn, no other pcr
son, unless it be Charles F. Lum
mis, has ever, attended one of their
ritualistic funerals.
The sketches made in the Indian
lands by Mr. Joullin very nearly
cost him his life, and have an un
usual value for that reason.
Lumtnis 'himself only escaped
with his skin full of buckshot, and
he earnestly warned Joullin not to
attempt to make any pictures.
Ji has been an interesting ques
tion to know why these Indians
should have settled in so desolate a
region, and, furthermore, why they
arc so uniformly fierce and wicked,
for it is only zchen doing penance
that they are not doing harm to
others. They come honestly by
their dispositions, for they are de
scendants of renegades, outlaws
and exiles from Mexico, who had
their choice of death or banishment

Hill had lived in Vera Cruz. Mexico. He
had worked on a planatation just previous
to coming to New York. While in the

through- ignorance or careless disregard

water. frequently drink it. In the water
he drank were mosquito larvae,

which are now feasting on his red blood

' Hill had -been In New York for a year
and a lÂ»alf before he knew what was th?
matter with him. He obtained employ

boy. His first ailment was noticed when
he was changed from a day to a night
shift of work. He grew restless. It was
Impossible for him to sit still for more
than a minute at a time. As long as he
was tugging at his elevator rope or was

there were few passengers and little ac

to rest. He would begin to fidget the mo

wrapped only In a sheet. Twenty of the
penltentes walked about the hideous cata
falque. Barefooted, bareheaded, their
faces hidden by black cloths, they had
nothing else upon them but white trous
ers. In their hands they carried each a
whip or scourge, called a discipline, made
from the fibers of cactus and soaproot.
As they marched they took long, decided
steps. After each step they paused and
swung their disclpllnas backward over
their shoulders, striking a sounding blow
upon .the bare back. All stepped together.
All of the blows fell at once. That was
what had at ilrst sounded to me like the
beating of the muffled drum.
As. the men walked and struck them
selves the bleed flowed from the wounds
caused by the stripe3. A bearer attended
them with- a. bucket of water and sponged
-them with 'some sort of fluid preparation.
-Following -the: self-torturing men came
an equal* number of women. They were
entirely dressed in black and carried each
a lighted candle. As they walked they
wailed, not In unison with the step of the
men, the beating whips or the music; Just
their sad, hopeless howl, that seem3 cop

At short intervals the two men in front
fired revolvers. When they came to the

crawling thus, purposely cut themselves
upon the sharp lava rocks. Rising again
they proceeded to their cemetery, a small
place marked by a low stone wall. Tho
head of each grave had a few rough
stones and a cross made of sticks lashed
together. A grave had already been dug
and the body was thrown into it with no
coffin and no shroud other than the small
sheet with which it had been covered.

that little maids usually adore. It is mere
ly a heavy pearl-sray broadcloth, slashed
from collar to hem into a design of long
drawn-out scrolls, between which show9
a background of heavy-meshed cream
lace. The gown is really made in two
pieces, although the girdle is so slight and
the scroll pattern of fhe bodice continues
so harmoniously in the skirt that the ef
fect at a litt't. distar.ee is that cf a prin
cess gown. It Is a costume that suggests
the stately, queenly type more than the
dainty, vivid personality of the owner: but
we, see her wear it. anil it apparently was
made for no one else. She and the gown
are altogether congenial.
The two Parisian triumphs are the tea
gown by 1'ulot ami the ball gown by
Pacquln. They are both carried out in a
scheme of shrimp pinkâ tho kind of pink
that lights up be>Â«t bohin'l artificial light.
It is an ideal 'color for cither tho stage or .
the ballroom." . ,
When Mii>3 Burkhart appears in that
extravagance of Cslot'C you can picture
her in some dim corner, shine upon by
rosy tapers. You can verily snifl the tex.
She brought this tea gown all the way
to San* ; Franclsco to christen it here, so
wo know it in all its glowing youth.
The uninitiated may gaze .admiringly
and think of it <i* an exquisite eh.ios of
silk and lace and fringe and chiffon, and
wonder where it begins and ends. Confi
dentially, it is made in two parts. First
goes? on a pink gros-grain silk petticoat
zigzagged with little white chiffon rufflea.
Above this is worn the pink crepe gown:
it parts to show tho petticoat beneath
fringes. The crepe is lined with taffeta
to match. Bands of white insertion and
bows of white satin ribbon relieve the
pink just where relief is needed.
.Now for the ball gown. It is one of
Pax-rjuin's masterpieces, and only one In
live hundred could wear it. Miss Burkhart
is the one.
A true description of it hardly comes un
der the heading of a fashion page at alL
It merges somehow ipto the personality of
its owner, and they together are one pic
ture. Because she is as lithe as a mer
maid the gown suits her. Venetian lace
is the foundation for a coral design, such
as was never seen before.. Iridescent
scales of shaded pink arc woven into the
coral branches that cover the bodice and
border the skirt. They gleam as only
things under the sea know how to gleam.
It Is horridly realistic to add that an inch-

of those necessary details that go to maka
up the -whole effect.
and she probably -wishes that nats were
not mountains. ;
Her fancy: for gray had its own way in
the matinee gown. Raudnitz designed It
in hia London-trained mind, and Raudnitz
likewise" carriri it out. The little maid'
who basks in the cozy warmth of Miss
Burkhart's service says, "I like it best of
all." And yet it docs not glitter with
vantage than when cut In long, unbroken
lines. The. lines of stitching in the back
follow the box pleat -from waist to bind
ing, the skirt having. a "moderate sweep
on the ground. The , black is relieved by
peeps of a scarlet dust .ruffle and: by the
white broadcloth which forms the. upper
revere and winks through the openwork
design of the lower.
The hat for this suit is a bit top ne.ivy,
as the hats of the period persist in being.
Upon a frame of gray straw are piled
masses of gray velvet and white chiffon
in puffy," pompadour, effects that- make
the:; fair wearer look like a detail. The
times, -not' Miss Burkhart, are to blame.
She is an artist in; everything she does,
from her acting to her choosing of clothes.

although she confesses to Paris workman

/^fHE is with usj once more. She

he is- never downed, and each season she
appears in. some nev,- development of cos
tume.
Neptune will star* lhiÂ» season of 1900
when the bathing girl visits him â provided
she be built upon the Paris model for
the bathing girl. Paris naij decreed fluffs
and frills. Accordion pleatedâ what? It's
worth while guessing. A cross, apparent
ly, between summer clouds and ocean
foam, which sounds more poetical than
prac*'cal. AVhether Paris ever intended
this mousseline creation to leave dry land
is a question. The wearer may either
hung her clothes on a hickory limb and
not go near the water or she may invest
in a now bathing suit daily. The latter,
perhaps. In more nearly what Paris,in
tended. For the spirits of shoppers rise
when fashions are perishable, and the
summer girl must cater to those spirits.
Flippant as the" French bathing suit
looks, however, there is an advantage in
it that rannot be overlooked. Professor
Qoetz of the t Lurhne Baths is responsible
for : the- Btntement that -European women
aro better dressed-for. bathing, than ours,
because their . costumes are 50 much
lighter, that the bather la freer In. the
water, "Those heavy clothes that Ameri
can women insist on wearing fire nothing
but 11 hindrance." he says. - "Wear a suit
that has little fullness, so that there is
the less wet cloth to tug. The French
womon are the wisest in the. matter of
dress, unless it be. the Germans; they go
barefooted into the surf."
So if you would be a gorgeous sight
upon the beach and a dashing swimmer
in the' surf you will find the Paris model
a safe one to follow. But if you.lind.lt
too ephemeral nnd claim that plain, good
enough-for-us America will do. very well,
then you will find that she seta the fash
ion thid year for as, modest and smart a
little bathing. suit as ever was designed.
Bloomers, skirt and sleeves are only mod
erately full; they will be as little hind
rance as j is Consistent with our national
modo of diessjns. Jersey is the worst
possible fabric. Professor Goetz thinks;
it clings like tangled seaweed.
Ho says also: "Be sure that the stock-
Ings are supported from the waist. Thia
$tves -greater freedom of motion."
'A handkerchief tied by the skilled hand
makes the best can in the world, it keeps
the hair dry and lends a coquettish little
ho\v . to top off . the bather's charm.
Though the- truth is (and It's a bitter
truth) that swimming is one thin? â¢and
keeping dry is another. If you are going
into the water for the real thing you may
as well leave caps and shoes behind and
make up your mind to ignore getting wjet.
Surely the costumes of 1900 are enough .
to tempt the summer girl to leave parasol
and gloves behind and to get really wet
In really water. California has chances
that interior States may envy. "The boys
and girls who have been brought up to
stand Home hardships ure the best swim
mers." the professor, says. "They have
less fear to overcome than the doll-baby
type has. Â¦ 'Whoever is bound to learn
might as well make up his mind to go
into the water, and the sooner* he grows
used to it the better. There 13 plenty in
theory, to be sure; there are methods that
every pupil should learn, but they won't
do any good unless put into practice in
the water, not on dry land."
Here is a c>;. ice for you: American du

the conclusive confirmation of imperial
NEW YORK. June 9.â The first detailed
report of the doings of the Boxers was
received by the Presbyterian Board to
day in a letter from Rev. Horace Hould
ing of the South Chi Li mission af Lin
Chlng, province of Shantung. He quotes
a letter to United States Minister Con
ger by Arthur S. Smith, as follows:
"There were alarms of an attack on the
village of Ho Chin Tun, in . China, by
Boxers from Chlng Ping. We addressed
letters, to each of the district magistrates
letting them know of the matter.
"The following morning the Boxers ap
peared at the village in a force repre
sented as 2'X), of whom perhaps thirty
were cavalry. They divided Into squads,
one party making for our chapel and
schoolhouj'e, the doors of which they
broke in and proceeded to loot the place,
carrying off everything, pulling out the
window-frames and burning them with
the doors for fuel.
"Directly in front of the chapel Is an
other, yard with commodious houses, oc
cupied by the mission and used as out
private headquarters for the district.
This place was also looted and wrecked.
"One party of the pillagers made for
the%house of the helper, which they en
tered and pillaged, but did less damage
than elsewhere owing to the vigorous re
monstrance to tho head men, who said
that if they burned the house It would set
fire to others adjoining. The members of
the family escaped over the wall, the
young daughter of the helper, a pupil in
our girls' school, having a narrow escape
from capture. The bandits gave chase,
but a neighbor mercifully assured them
the child was hers and thus saved her."
DETAILED REPORT OF
DOINGS OF THE BOXERS
probably based on something broader
than personal curiosity, to learn what are
the intentions of the United States Gov
ernment. It appears that the State De
partment has dealt frankly with such In
quiries and has made no concealment of
its policy of non-interference beyond a
point necessary to protect American life
and property. It Is deemed entirely
proper, however, to move along the same
lines as those followed by European na
tions toward the accomplishment of this
object, so that while there are no entang
ling understandings or alliances all the
substantial results of a Joint action may
be achieved.
United States naval forces ashore at Tien
tsin and Peking in guarding the Chinese
railways, and he is free to exercise* his
own discretion In that respect.
Â¦The State Department oinclals felt that
the action taken- by the Navy Depart
ment in the dispatch of naval vessels to
the scene of trouble and the landing of
naval forces represents all that can be
done, or at-least air that should be done,
by the United States at this moment. The
department remains unshaken In its at
titude, and while willing to work on par
allel lines with the other powers to re
store peace In China. Insists on retaining
its Independence of action.
When attention was directed to the
probability that the United States naval
forces ashore at Tientsin might- be called
upon to join with these foreign naval con
tingents in the ,defense of the town or
the railroad. It was pointed out that this
action would be purely military, and
would not constitute joint action from a
political point of view. Â«
The foreign embassies and legations in
Washington are Intensely interested In
the developments In Chin?., and applica
tions are frequent at the State Depart
ment from them for the latest news as to
what is going on. There also Is a strong
desire on the part of these diplomats.
the time would be required for the ves
sels at Shanghai to make the trip to
Tientsin that would be cpnsumed by the
Nashville. The Navy Department has
sent Instructions to the commander of
the Monocacy at Shanghai to report to
Admiral Kempff at Taku, and that ves
sel is already on her way. Although an
old ship, the Monocacy is admirably
adapted to this kind of service, drawing
only nine feet of water and carrying a
very good secondary battery. Her per
sonnel Is 12 officers and 146 men. The
Castine and Yorktown also are at Shang
hai and can be drawn upon, according
to Admiral Remey's dispatch, by Admiral
Kempjr, if he wants more men. These
vessels are of 1000 and 1700 tons displace
ment respectively, with batteries about
the same as the Nashville. The Castlne's
personnel is 11 officers and 142 men; the
Yorktown's 14 officers and 1S1 men.
Minister Conger's dally report was even
less encouraging than usual. In his ca
blegram to Secretary Hay this morning
lie said that the situation was ' unim
proved; that the burning of railroad
plants continues, and that owing to the
inertness cf ihe Chinese troops It would
be necessary to employ foreign troops to
protect the railways.
The State Department has not deemed
It necessary to send any specific author
ixatlon to Mr. Conger to employ the
to draw upon the ships at Shanghai for
mere. "REMEY."
In view of the length of tl^ne required
by the Nashville to make the trip to
Taku ; it is fortunate that the Navy De
partment has other reinforcements near

Mayor Moores, who expressed his sym
pathy with the Boers. A large number of
people shook hands with Mr. Wessels.
Later a largely attended mass meeting
was held In .the theater, at which Gover
nor Poynter presided. The Governor an
nounced that his sympathy was with tho
Boers and every other country struggling
for liberty.
W. J. Bryan made an address in which
he urged that it was the duty of every
man whose sympathy was with the Boers
to express It. and gave it as his opinion
that the pro-Boer sentiment in this coun

thought if that was backed up by the offi
cial moral support of the Government It
would be sufficient to prevent the extinc

The audience received Mr. Bryan with
unbounded enthusiasm. -In the course of
his speech he said: ,
"I came as a citizen, an American citi
zen, to be present with other American
citizens to meet the representatives of the
Boer republics, to join with you In pre
senting to them our sympathy for their
cause, and as I earnestly believe the sym

people. I trust that the day will never
come when a natlort fighting for liberty
will look In vain to the American people
for sympathy and aid. These envoys have
honored us by coming to seek our sym
pathy, giving us as Americans the oppor
tunity to assist them to gain that liberty
which Is so dear to us.
BRYAN TALKS FOR
BENEFIT OF THE BOERS
LONDON, June 9.â John Morley. speak
ing at Oxford, said he could form no Idea
what distinguished "Liberal imperialism"
from "Unionist Imperialism." When men
In high positions talk of conscription to
insure not security but predominance of
empire, he. confessed his inability to see
the difference between Liberal imperial
ism' and Liberal militarism.' He rejoiced
In the British triumphs as Indicating the
strength of tho resources of the country
and because he believed that the sooner
the war Is ended the better for every
body. Including the Boers. But in his
opinion, -he said,, not all the . alleged
wrongs of the UJtlanders put together
were worth â¢ the â¢ desolation of a single
stricken British or Boer t home. The sa
cred word "free" had been' blotted out in
the new title of the Orange State and the
British empire has done a great wrong
and he believed that there is scarcely an
Englishman who would not bitterly re
pent for so doing. There must be a very
different spirit, he declared, shown in the
settlement to what has prevailed In South
Africa, the last twelve months.
MORLEY SAYS BRITAIN
HAS DONE GREAT WRONG
LONDON, June 10.â News of the
highest importance came yesterday
from Natal, where, at Laings Nek,
General Buller succeeded in out
flanking the Boers, who sent a flag
of truce, offering to surrender on certain
conditions. Sir Redvers declined to accept
any but unconditional surrender, but at
any moment news may arrive that the
Boers have laid down their arms.
The importance of the move Is that the
Boers have been surrounded before the
commandos which evacuated Pretoria had
time to get down to reinforce them, while
on the other hand a barrier has been In
terposed between the Transvaal comman
dos and those still operating in Orange
River Colony.
Westward a deployment of General Hlld
yard's division should enable General
Kelly-Kenny and Colville to complete the
envelopment of President Steyn's follow
ing at Bethlehem and secure their surren
der, a stroke which would hasten the
complete pacification of the Orange River
Colony.
Two thousand Boers, with six field guns,
have, however, appeared at Roodeval,
north of Kroonstad, and have cut the
telegraph lines, so there Is a likelihood of
more fighting before the country is
cleared. Though there Is still a consid
erable number of burghers under arms
In the acquired British territory, there is
but a desperate remnant probably which
desires fighting.
Lord Roberts is making no sign, but no
doubt before long we shall hear of the
beginning of further important operations.

SYMPATHY FOR THE -
STRUGGLING REPUBLICS
This conclusion of Mr. Bryan's speech
was. the signal for a cheer and a grand
rush for the stage to shake his band aa
well as that cf Mr. Wessels. .^
"We must keep inspired with that love
and reverence for the blessed came of lib
erty till every American citizen goes down
on his knees and asks the god of battla
to bring victory to the Boers."
"There are men amors us who say that
because England sympatnlzed with 113
during the Spanish-American war wo
ought to say nothing against such a
friendly nation. I deny that such sym
pathy binds us to act for England. We
did not need the sympathy of England,
during the Spanish-American war. Wo
need the sympathy of no nation on earth.
We have received nothing that obliges U3
to remain passive and helpless while lib
erty is being crushed. We should not be
unmindful of our duties to the people of
this world struggling for their liberty â
we tho greatest cation on earth founded
on liberty. ' , â¢ - '
"It is said that the blood of the martyr
is the seed of the church. If it Is found
that these people shall be overcome they
will not have fought In vain. Sometimes
the men who die do more for liberty than,
they who live, and ere the struggle is over
I believe that the Boers v*il\ arise from a
hundred fields and liberty will be victori
ous.
"We know by history that as monarchy
Increases, so government by tho consent
of the people decreases, and that as gov
ernment by the consent of the people in
creases, so monarchy decreases. We
know that if a monarchy overcomes these
two republics government by the consent
of the people ceases.
"There comes a time when the millions
of American people have that privilege of
rising and casting their ballots against
that administration of government which)
falls to carry out their wishes, and when,
those ballots are next counted I bellevo
that they will be an expression of tho
American people for these people fighting
for their independence.
ways clung to me on the text: 'As Ha
Thtnketh. So He Is?" Why should any
American citizen who feels for the Boers
fall to express himself? I do not see how
one can do other than choose the cause of
the two republics in prcferencq to that of
a monarchy; an American citizen who has
lived under and has learned to love and
venerate our form of Government.

this time the. growth of the order de
manded the apportionment of the State
to four district deputies, and Â¦ the past
presidents of the first four parlors were
selected to fill the offices. 1 Some idea of
the rapidity with which the parlors
formed can be gained when it is*Â§tated
that within four months after the organ

there were seventeen' p\rlors represented

After" the Institution of the first nine

statement:
â¢The capture of General Pio del Pllar
cabled by General MacArthur this morn-
Ing is a most important one. Pllar was
regarded at one of the most active and

he was unable to hold the place for any
great length of time, he succeeded In
withdrawing his troops to the mountains
and in eluding the several columns sent
out to destroy him. ,_-,,_â¢
"It was difficult to keep track of.hia
movements and he frequently was re
ported as being at a number of places at*
the same time. That his capture has been*
effected by the native police at Manila, a

afresh the loyalty of these men to the
American cause, so often Impugned by
both Americans and Filipinos "

In all the work of the executive com
mittee Mi.-s Daisy V. Llttleneld, at pres

order of Native Daughters was organ
ized in ]tÂ£C, is being decorated tastily and
will be shown with much pride to the vis
itors.
The programme arranged is as follows:
A bana concert on Monday evening, when
it is expected all delegates will have arr
rived, owing to the running time of trains
making it necessary to come Monday or
miss .the first day's session. Tuesday
evening there will be a reception at Webb

Love's Opera-house. Wednesday after
noon the Grand Parlor will adjourn at 3
o'clock and the members will In a body
visit the Zella mine, just "south of town,
where thpy will be privileged to witness
the process of deep mining and see a
stamp mill at work. Some may be allowed
to go down as far as the 1200 level, but
this will necessitate a change of clothing
and more nerve than ordinary mortals are
possessed of. Wednesday evening will be.
given un to *a hand concert and poppy

MiÂ«s Lillie O. Roichling, the founder of
the order, has been graciously honored by
Ursula Parlor No. 1. The well deserved
compliment was put In enduring form â a
beautiful banner, unique in design. It was
presented on Saturday evening. September

honor. The banner is wrought. In yellow
and white si!k and bullion embroidery. On
the white ' silk has been painted in oils

of sprays of oak and laurel, tied with a

which is of yellow silk, is the Inscription
in silver, outlined in blue. "Founded by
Lily O. Reichling September 3>, 1SS^." Be

is much regretted that the young lady
cannot be present at this spssion of the
Grand Parlor at h n r old home and birth
place, but she is absent .Jn Germany, en
route to China, where she expects to re
main for two or three years. Â»
It was In the little "Red Front" base
ment on Main street that about twenty
young lady residents of Jackson met in
response to an Invitation issued, by Miss
Reichling on September 11. 13.36. Many
were the conjectures as to why they were
there. After unfoMing the object of the
meeting <the formation of a parlor of Na
tive Daughters of the Golden West) vari
ous and many were . the views expressed
respecting the project. In rather an in
definite way the aims of such a society
were understood.
The several consecutive rebuffs experi
enced at the hands of the Native Sons
when questioned regarding the feasibility
of allowing tha Native Daughters a side
degree in their order was possibly the
final assistant In the conclusion that 'the
young ladles born in California could
themselves organize a separate fraternity,
progress and be recognized as an inde
pendent order. However, to the very suc
cessful institution of the Native Sons and
to the popularity of that organization Is
due a great deal of the rapid growth of
the order of Native Daughters. The
name, object and membership of the new
order were thus set forth In Ursula Par

member of the directorate.
In an -interview to-day Kearney accepts

withdrawal of Kearney several prominent
growers came forward and signed the

at the next session of Congress without
opposition. ... - ,
Speaking of trusts, he expressed him
self as being unable to understand how
the Democrats would be able to make
their existence an issue in the approach
ing campaign, for the reason that during
the four years that party was in control
of affairs a number of bills were intro
duced bearing upon the subject, but none
ever paused the committee room. He had
no opinion to express regarding the pres

sion, he reiterated the statement made
by him last winter to the effect that he
was not a" candidate for re-election. "'

was reached. \ It was learned in certain
authoritative , quarters, however, that
while the Governor could not be brougnt
over, to the way of reasoning of some of
the qity^ptttcials, he did unbend to the ex
tent of offering some suggestions which,
in his opinion, might have a salutary
effect upon the more rabid element of the
general public. If not. then he would act
as in his judgment seemed. proper for the
preservation of the law. Jie advised,
among other things, that the Transit Com
pany augment the running: of its cars at
night and If this experiment resulted in
disorder and its attendent results, he
would unhesitatingly call out," the State
militia for Its suppression..
Acting, apparently, upon this advice, the
Transit Company to-night further In
creased its transportation facilities by
running, cars on three more of its divisions
â the Laclede avenue. Market street and
Olive street. The Llndell division, which
resumed its. night service two days ago,
was also in operation to-night. The po
lice officers were, for the most part, with
drawn frofn guard duty during the day
to-day to properly prepare them for tiie

ADVSHTISEMENTS.
In view of the great multitude of wo-
men suffering from some form of female
disease, and yet unable to find any cure.
Dr. Hartman, the renowned gynaecolo-
gist, has announced his willingness to
direct the treatment of as many cases as
make application to him during the sum-
mer months, without charge.
The treatment will be conducted by cor-
respondence. The doctor will prescribe
all medicines, applications, hygienic and
dietary regulations necessary to copiplete
a cure. The medicines prescribed can be
obtained at all. drug stores. This offer
will hold good only during the summer
months. Any woman can become a reg-
ular patient by sending a written state-
ment of her age, condition of life, history
and symptoms of her derangements.
All cases of female diseases, including
menstrua* irregularities, displacements,
ulceratious, inflammations, discharges. Ir-
ritation of the ovaries, tumors and dropsy
of the abdomen, should apply at once and
become registered a3 regular patients. All
correspondence will be held strictly confi-
dential. Xo testimonials of cures will bo
given to the public except by the express
wish of the patient.
As is well known. Dr. Hartman 13 the
President of the Hartman Sanitarian, an
institution which has a department de-
voted excjuslvely to the treatment of fe-
male diseases, lie is thus brought to see
thousands of such cases every year, the
most of whom return to their homes to be
treated by correspondence. The principal
remedy he relies upon in such cases is
Peruna. which every woman should have
who has any affection of this kind. Those
wishing to become patients should ad-
dress DR. S. B. HARTMAN", COLUMBUS.
OHIO.
No one knows better than Dr. Hartman
how much the women suffer with diseases
peculiar to their sex. Xo one knows bet-
ter than he does how many, of them suffer
with such diseases. Patiently, hopefully.
DR. S. B. HARTMAN.
Another woman who uaed Penina with-
out becomlns one of Dr. Hartman'a regu-
lar patients had the following experience.
Miss Ida Green writes from Baldwlnvllle^
Ga. : "Peruna is wonderful and good. and.
a certain cure for female weakness. I
have been ill and have been taking doc-
tor's medicine for several years, and
found that none did me ajiy good.
"Every day it was a worry. I was
always sick. I had come io iho
conclusion to give up and not use
any more medicine. I was sick
indeed for the past two years. Just
bsfora I began to take Peruna I was
very weak, besides I was bilious and
constipated.

years with a chronic female dcranÂ«reTT;Â»nt

sician, and remedy after remedy, without
any permanent Improvement. Her treat-
ment had cost her husband. whrÂ» was a
poor man. hundreds of dollars. They ha<i
been obliged to deny themselves many
comforts of life in order to get mor.ey
enough to pay the physicians.
Yet. in ?pite of all economy, there wnÂ«t

cause of the expense her Illness had
brought upon them. The woman had be-
come weak, nervous and wretched, scarce-
ly able to keep out of her bed. Her chil-
dren were growing up neglected and
ragged, because of the want of a mother'*
care. Her husband was becoming discour-
aged and broken down with overwork.
The Home of Peruna.
Picking up the paper one day the hap-
pened to read an item which contained
the news that Dr. Hartman would treat
such cases free of charge by letter. She
Immediately wrote the doctor, describing
her case, and glvtns him all her symp-
toms. She soon received a letter telling
her exactly what to do and what medi-
cines and appliances to get. She began
the treatment (the principal remedy be-
ing reruna) at once, and In a few weeks
was well and strong again and able to do
her own work.

PARIS, June 0. â The grave situation In
China, v.hich has developed this week,
monopolizes the attention of the political
world and has thrown a shadow over
<,ueFtions of minor interest, even including
the Transvaal. Paris and Its politicians
admit the seriousness of the condition of
affairs around Peking, and apprehensions
are expressed !est it lead to international
complications.
The creattst element of danger in the
situation is generally felt to be the double
duel of supremacy proceeding between
Russia and England and Russia and
Japan. The sympathies of Frenchmen
are naturally with their ally, Russia. The
next few days, it is expected, will bring
forth important events. It Is not thought
that England is likely at the present mo
ment, when her hands are fully occupier!
with South Africa, to take any step to
produce an Anglo-Rus=ian collision; but
she Is firmly believed here to be behind
Japan, and her support may encourage the
latter to adopt such a policy as will even
tuate in hostilities with Russia, for
which, apparently, the Japanese are Itch-
Ing. The action of the United States "Is
acknowledged to be a most important
factor In the situation and advices from
Washington are closely followed here with
a view of gaining therefrom a clear indi
cation as to whether America will act In
dependently in her dealings with the
Chinese Government or will throw in her
lot with ont of the two rival groups or
powers.
Her friendly relations with both Russia
and England favor the Impression that
she will endeavor to steer an independent
course, but will at the same time, if com
pelled by the force of events, reluctantly
join Japan and England. At the Foreign
Office r.o attempt is made to conceal tne
anxiety which prevails, but while the
feeling cannot be said to be optimistic, it
is hoped the storm gathering about the
Chinese Empire will be weathered.
The following statement is furnished the
Associated Press by a representative of
the oftiee as expressing the views of the
French Government:
"Tli* situation is undoubtedly very seri
ou" 5 and unless the Chinese Government
rouses itself to a thorough appreciation
of the dangers threatening its very exist
ence it is cifflcult to foresee what will be
?lie outcome. Our cable advices leave the
condition of affairs somewhat obscure, but
it is evident that the Peking Government
must act promptly and vigorously If it is
to stamp out the rebellion. Despite the
stories of defeats of the Chinese troops,
we still think the army is sufficiently
strong to suppress the insurrection, but it
mustaet at once. In the meantime we In
tend to co-operate with the other powers
in taking such measures as are necessary
to safeguard our countrymen and their
properties. Our Minister and admiral
nave been Instructed to take this course.
Our interests are identical with those of
the United States, and there is every rea
son to believe we shall act In unison dur
ing the present crisis. The aim of both is
to act purely In defense of the lives and
Interests of our compatriots which are
now in such peril.

and Anthony Hope.
Sir Henry was given a tremendous re
ception when he rose to respond to the
toast to his health, but the features of the
evening were speeches made by Embassa
dor Choate and Mark Twain. Mr. Choate
for the first time -since he |ias been In
England, seemed to give free vent to hfs
humor an d he did not hesitate to remind
Englishmen that the traits of character
which they had heretofore, with lofty
superiority, regarded as purely American
had been lately repeated and exceeded In
England.
"Heretofore," said Embassador Choate
the enthusiasm which the United States
nas displayed on occasions has been re
garded as quite unbecoming a great peo
ple, but that was before certain events in
your own history. Never in our history
has there been such an outbreak as that
ri e Â« e J P I-ondon on the occasion of the re
lief of Ladysmith and Mafeking."
Choate eulogized Irving and paid a trib
ute to him for what he had accomplished
to foster the good relations between the
two countries.
Lord Russell proposed the health of Sir
Henry. Irving in an eloquent speech, to
which Irving feelingly responded. In the
course of his speech Irving said:
"* rom an expeVience of seventeen years
1 may say that the fortunes of England
are dear to those Americans who guide
and control the destinies of their country
and it is niy belief that the bonds between
Gr w?. t Br "t a 'n and the great American re
public will grow ever closer with time
"And one who has been through that
great country, who has shared the wel
come of its great-hearted people and who
has seen and felt, as I have again and
again, the loyal, loving warmth and affec
tion for the old land, can only feel that
for all good and high purposes and all
that makes for the elevation and freedom
of humanity and the good of the human
rare, the two lands are one."
Mark Twain's speech, in 'which he de
scribed his experiences as a dramatist

preps of various countries regarding the
probability of international complications
will not be realized. The one thing- to be
feared appears to be friction between
Japan and Russia, but we think tho Japa
nese Government is too wise to pit itself
against the might of the Russian empire.
Japan is certainly very strong on the sea,
l.ut on land it is quite a different matter.
We are hoping that the trouble will b'ow
over through resolute action en the part
of the Chinese Government."
Interest in the Transvaal has subsided
very considerably since Lord Roberts
began his victorious march and espe
cially since he announced that the
Johannesburg gold mines were un
injured. Fear of -damage to the mines,
in which an immense amount of French
money Is invested, has been the leading
cause of anxiety for the Frenchman, who
in nowise shared the advice freely given
the Boers by a portion of the French
press to destroy the mines as a latter-day
emulation of the burning of Moscow by
Un.> Russians.
French shareholders failed to see the
heroic side of this act, through which
they would be the greatest sufferers, and
the news of the safety of the mines
brought a sigh of relief. The subsequent
occupation of Pretoria by the British re
coived scant attention and most of the
journals are of the opinion that it does
not mean an end of the war, but that, on
the contrary, it will be succeeded by the
now much talked of guerrilla warfare,
which they predict will tire the British
out and cost 1 them more blood and treas
ure than even yet have been expended.
The golden harvest of the exposition
has at last begun. Twice this week the
number of visitors exceeded half a mil
lion, which surpasses the figures of the
1S89 exposition at a similar period. It Â«.s
estimated that over 8,000,000 persons have
now passed the turnstiles. The greatest
difficulty now is experienced in getting
from the grounds at night, the streetcar
and omnibus facilities being utterly inad
equate to cope with the immense crowds,
and the cabmen are having high times,
demanding and getting fancy prices for
short trips home. It is nothing unusual
for them to ask $2 for a trip for which the
legal fare_is 30 cents;
The electrical arrangements at the
Chateau d'Eau have been repaired and il
luminations during the evening are now
very brilliant and effective. The Ameri
can pavilion was closed four days this
week for the Improvement of its internal
decorations. A large piece of statuary
representing three wild bronchps forms a
very striking centerpiece and about it are
palms and flowers and a circular sofa.
The walls have been repainted a softer
color, relieving the former glare of. white,
and a number of paintings have been
hung. Further improvements are contem
plated. The juries have begun their tasks
and the American representatives in each
group are hard at work seeking honors
for United States exhibits.
Parisians, who so long have reveled in
the cabarets representing death, heaven
and hell, which almost every visitor con
siders a part of the sights of Paris, are
now offered another morbid attraction in
the shape of a drama written and- per
formed by a couple of Parlslennes who
have just been released ' after serving
terms of Imprisonment for attempted
murder. One is an actress who was con
victed of attempting to dispose of a rival
by a diet of pins concealed In a pudding.
The other was a heroine of a cause cel
ebre of last year. She had tried to poison
her husband with strychnine and on con
viction attempted to commit suicide by
driving a hatpin through her heart. The
women made acquaintance .with each
other while In the prison of St. L,azare
by rapplngs on the wall dividing their
cells. On their release recprttly they
wrote a play which is very "sensational
and partly autobiographical and which
will shortly be produced at one of the
Email theaters within the exposition

LONDON, June 9.â The Chinese situa
tion which, at the beginning of the week,
was merely a small cloud on the interna
tional horizon, now overshadows every
other topic. England, according to most
authoritlest-save those ' who control her
foreign policyâ Is face to face with a
crisis in Far Eastern aftairs which, though
it may not result in any immediate parti
tion of China, must determine the part
that England shall play when the parti
tion eventually occurs. That such an
emergency should have arisen at a mo
ment when England is least able to util
ize it, when almost all her land forces
are 6000 miles from home and when there
is a paramount necessity for keeping an
extra strong fleet In European waters, Is
deplored by all shades of statesmen and
politicians.
Lord Salisbury stands almost alone
in his own party In believing that the
results of the Boxer outbreak will neither
be serious nor permanent. The attitude
he adopts toward the unanimous agita
tion for more strenuous action is voiced
by an intimate friend, who said to a rep
resentative of tht: Associated Press:
"Lora Salisbury believes we should be
thankful for small mercies. The co-oper
ation ot" diplomats and authorities on the
spot seems perfectand unusually harmoni
ous. So long as this satisfactory state of
affairs continues he will be eminently sat
isfied and will take no other steps, unless
one or several of the powers ask Great
Britain's assent to a scheme which ap
pears feasible, or unless Russian aggres
sion becomes much more apparent than it
is to-day. When these contingencies oc
cur, or the representatives of various na
tions at Peking fall to agree, then will
Lord Salisbury assume the Initiative.
Belies on Macdonald.
"At present he is agreeably surprised at
the smooth progress of the negotiations
at the- seat of the disturbance and im
plicitly trusts in Sir Claude Macdonald,
the British Minister to China."
It might be added that Great Britain's
Premier is not particularly optimistic re
garding the length of time the various
Ministers and admirals in the Far East
will eo-ooerate so admirably. But Lord
Salisbury is far too philosophical to bor
row troubles. In the meanwhile the mem
bers of very embassy in London and every
club, to say nothing of the stock market,
are discussing eagerly the prospects of
war between two powers arising from the
Peking troubles.
It is tlie old cry of "Wolf!" and this
time many well-informed people are
greatly Inclined to believe that the wolf
will materialize in the shape of Russia,
with Japan as her opponent. Admiral
Freemantle's reported statement that war
between these countries is inevitable cre
ates no surprise, though such plain speak
ing Is severely discountenanced officially.
A Government official, speaking to a rep
resentative of the Associated Press, said:
"I believe Admiral Freemantle said what
Is credited to him.- He Is a splendid offi
cer but a harsh talker. It is not the first
time he has said things which had
better been left unsaid."
The financial situation arising from the
Chinese dlsturb/inces is by no means sat
isfactory to those who have any large
holdings.
One curious feature Is the opinion held
by many financiers that If the present dis
turbance portends opening up China it
also portends an inestimable, increase in
circulation of silver, with the accompany
ing tendency to put that metal on a parity
with gold. A well-known American finan
cier in London explained this to a repre
sentative of the Associated Press, point-
Ing out the fact that copper is now the
general medium of exchange in China.
/ With the ingress of Europeans these
cumbersome tokens would naturally be
done away with and silver introduced in
the most populous country In the world.
On this basis there has been a strong un
dertone in the silver market, with in
teresting discussions on the political and
economical Incident upon the possibili
ties of the increased use of sliver.
America's Fart.
With the exception of the discussion as
to the possible part the United States may
play In assisting Great Britain in pulling
the chestnuts out of the fire in the far
East little interest is being taken in
Great Britain in American affairs. The
Presidential prospects are made the sub
ject of editorials, and the English cor
respondents In America are sending long
reviews of the chances of President Mc-
Kinley and William Jennings Bryan, but
these fail to stimulate any keen attention.
' The weeklies refer to Stephen Crane's
death with sincere regret and admiration.
His name is generally coupled with that
of Stevens. Tho Spectator says:
"Crane was a writer of singular force
and originality, whose studies In the psy
chology of peril had the quality of clair
voyance nothing short of magical." â¢

BERLIN. Jiine 9.â The situation In
China Is here regarded as of the utmost
importance. Though the Foreign Office
has been rather uncommunlcable through
out the week toward all foreign corre
spondents, enough reliable Information
has leaked out to show that the whole
Government, with the Emperor and the
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count von
Bulow, leading, consider the suppression
of the anti-foreigner movement In China
as prerequisite for a possible rejuvena
tion of ChlnaÂ»and certainly for the estab
lishment of healthy commercial conditions,
and Germany is, therefore, as the officials
of the Foreign Office emphatically say to
the correspondent of the Associated Press,
in favor of harmonious joint action by all
the powers interested in China, witnout
permitting any single power to reap self
ish advantages from the situation, nor
tne group ot powers doing so. Thus far
the German Government Is not in posses
sion of official or otherwise reliaDle in
formation that any one power is attempt
ing to get ahead of the rest, nor that
the Dowager Kmpre*s of China really fa
vors the iioxer movement.
The tailure of the Chinese troops to
subdue the movement results, it is said
here, simply from the normal procrasti
nation ot the Government and the cow
ardice of the Chinese army and It3 com
manders. Reliable Information Is to the
effect that Germany at all events will
vigorously exert herself with the other
powers to put an end to the present un
bearable situation.* His Majesty's instruc
tions are that while Germany In no way
puts herself unduly forward and is willing
to loyally co-operate with the rest of the
powers, she will under no circumstances
permit the present conditions to go on and
thereby suspicion be aroused that Ger
many is seeking separate aims, which, of
course, is absurd.
The Cologne Gazette to-day points out
inspirediy that the main aim now is to
re-establish orderly conditions In China.
Nobody seems to care whether the Chi
nese Government thereby comes to grief
or how the relations between the powers
are thereby altered. It seems relatively
unimportant whether the conservative or
reform party in China be In power.
The Reichstag debates during the last
days were quite interesting, although the
final passage of the navy bill was a fore
gone conclusion. The manner in which
lierr Mueller. Centrist. Friday fiercely
took to task the Minister of Commerce,
Herr BrefeW, and the Minister of the
Treasury, Baron von Thielmann, showed
that the Government under the present
circumstances is willing to stand almost
any treatment from the Center, provided
the latter passes the navy bill. Incident
ally the panic which seized the German
boerses Thursday, under which even the
most favorite securities. Industrials and
coal shares, went down In soma cases
from 10 to 15 per cent, came up, and Herr
Lucke, the agrarian, said that another
German "krach" like that of 1S73 was
pending, owing to overspeculatlon and
greed.
On account of China Interest In the
South African news tlagged this week.
The semi-official Post has, however, pub
lished a remarkable article. It asks, "Is
the annexation of the republics to be con
sidered a fact?" which the far-sighted
never doubted, and then proceeds to con
sider the development of Africa aftefr
.peace. It recognizes danger for Germany
in the British watchword "From the Cape
to Cairo," but points out that both the
German and French colonial belts break
In continuity in the British possessions
and that moderation on all sides will
bring about a sensible modus Vivendi. It
adds that a certain number of Boers will
be welcomed in German colonies if they
drop all pretensions to separate political
existence. The task of civilizing and
opening up the Dark Continent for trade
may well be divided between the three
leading European nations without caus
ing strife.
Dr. von Mlquel's pro-agrarian speech at
the Posen Exposition is generally com
mented on by the press from various
standpoints. The whole Liberal press
points out that the speech openl;* showed
where lies the miscarriage of all Prince
Hohenlohe's liberal plans within the Cab
inet.

. WASHINGTON. June 9.â The State De
partment has disavowed responsibility
for the action of Consular Agent Vasco,
p.t IÂ«ipaz, Mexico, and Captain Fields of
the Ranger, In interfering with the local
Mexican magistrate at Lapaz, done to
hasten the trial of one of two Grlgrsby
Brothers on a charge of malicious perse
cution. The Grigsbys, an American busi
ness llrm at Lapaz. were prosecuted by
a discharged employe, a native, for ma
licious prosecution, and the case is pend
ing before the Mexican courts.
The American officials referred to ad
dressed a written request to the magis
trate to be furnished with the record in
the case. As the Mexican Government has
already shown a commenQÂ«ule disposition
to accede to all proper representations
from Minister Clayton respecting the
casr. which was running smoothly in the
diplomatic channels, the action of the
naval captain and the consular agent was
regarded as unwarranted and they have
been admonished against a repetition of
the offense. The Mexican Government is
entirely satisfied with the prompt action
of the State Department In the matter.

ST. LOUIS, June 9.â A movement to or
ganize a company to compete with the
fruit trust has been started here by Balti
more, Boston and New Orleans j capital
ists. The papers which are necessary to
insure the establishment of the company
have been drawn up and signed.
The scheme of the promoters of the
company contemplates the purchase of
fruit farms and- franchises in South anil
Central America and the operation of a
line of steamships to the ports of those
countries to transport the fruit to this
country. The capital stock of the organi
zation is to be $500,000, but it Is declared
that its resources will be many times that
amount.
TO OPPOSE FRUIT TRUST.
Justice of the Teace Barry has taken ex
ception to the strictures of Assessor
Dodge regarding his delay In deciding a
suit brought against A. B. Caldwell. a
warehouseman, to compel him to divulge
the names of his customer?, so that the
goods belonging to them and stored In hla
warehouse could be assessed. Judge
Barry holds that the Assessor is clearly
in contempt, and he may yet return a
charge to that effect. He say* that he has
taken some time to decide the case prop
erly, as the rights of the municipal ko\
ernment and the rights of ProP^y?â¢."^*
are involved. Harry says that Dodge *
anxiety to compel an early decision lies in
the fact that the Assessor la entitled to
retain half of the moneys recovered In an
action of thi3 kind.

STOCKTON, June 10.â The train that
should have arrived here at 8:15 last even-
Ing was delayed till nearly 1 o'clock this
morning by the forward trucks of the
engine leaving the rails two miles this
side of the Altamont tunnel. The train
was brought to a standstill in short order,
and no one was injured further than a
shaking up. An engine was sent from
Tracy to the relief of the disabled locomo
tive and to bring the train to Stockton.
The accident marred the opening of the
annual turnfest of the northern district
of California. The Sacramento and Marys
vllle delegates came in all right, but the
large crowd from San Francisco. Oakland,
San Jose and other points did not reach
the city tlll'l o'clock. The programme was
postponed, but those in the city met at
Turner Hall and passed a most enjoyable
evening till the train arrived, when they
escorted the delayed delegates to the head,
quarters, where a banquet was served. An
athletic programme will be given to-mor
row, and in the evening a singing contest
between the teams from the various
vereins will take place.

â¢ This afternoon's parade, the final public
feature, was the climax of Dewey day.. A
half-holiday was generally observed and
the people crowded themselves in the
downtown streets. In Grand Circus Park
at thevhead of the boulevard a thousand
children, seated on a sloping structure,
sang as the admiral and his wife rode
past, a version of the "Star Spangled
Banner" adapted to express praise of
Dewey's naval achievements.
The closing spectacle was a review of
the pageant from a stand erected in front
of the City Hall. Headed by Brigadier
General Duffleld and Governor Pingree,
marching men passed in review across the
Campus Maritus. They were saluted by
the admiral in true military fashion, spe
cial deference being paid to the regular
arid volunteer naval battalions and the
G. A. R. veterans.
Admiral and Mrs. Dewey anticipate a
quiet Sunday. On Monday they proceed
to Grand Rapids.
Salutes were fired on the Canadian

Despite all this the Chinese trade of the
United States has made wonderful prog
ress in the last decade. American en
gines, rails and structural iron are under
selling the world. The foreign trade of
Siberia, such as it is, is American. In
Port Arthur two foreign firms and much
of the material with which the Russian
Government is provisioning Port Arthur
Is of American manufacture.
Foreign manufacturers of cotton yarns
In Hongkong and Shanghai say that they
cannot compete with Fall River yarns,
because their labor is so inferior to Amer-
Great American Progress.
- The reason for this is that American
merchants have not so much sought the
markets of the Far East as that the trade
has been found for them by others. That
is to say, American goods are shipped to
China in English bottoms and for the
most part pass through the hands of for
eigners, especially Englishmen. There are
few Americans on the spot, and orders
come through foreign firms because
American goods happen to suit their pur
pose. Thus the American manufacturer
is often in ignorance of what is wanted.
There is to-day a pressing necessity for
Americans who shall live in China to keep
home manufacturers informed of what is
really wanted.
Another reason why American manufac
tures have not a wider field in the Far
East Is because they do not yet feel the
necessity for such a market. This leads
to a ce'rtain hand-to-mouth policy into
which dishonesty occasionally creeps. For
instance, only recently the American Con
sul in Yokohama was called upon to cer
tify that In a cargo of cotton sent to
Japan from America there were several
bales weighted in the middle with plaster
of paris. Such incidents are most un
fortunate,'especially since American mer
chants hero complain of Japanese dis
honesty. It is more to be regretted be
cause American cotton has only in ttin
last few years been exported directly from
America. Before that it all come through
Liverpool in the bands of ; English mer
chants. It was only through the efforts
of our former Consul, Mr. McKiver, in
President Cleveland's term, that the Jap
anese manufacturers were led to buy their
cotton directly from America. Japan is
no loncer so far out of the world that
commercial irregularities will not come
home to roost on the shoulders of tho
wrongdoers.
Trade Through Middlemen.
The United States in her efforts to meet
the demands of the Chinese market stands
between Great Britain and Germany. Not
so -ionservative as the Englishman, the
Arc irican manufacturer has not yet felt
the pressure of competition at home
which makes the German so eager to
manufacture especially for the Eastern
market. The East is still for the Ameri
can a place where surplus manufactures
may be gotten rid of, rather than a mar
ket for whkfli a distinct class of goods
must be made.
Japan, from her proximity and kinship
to China, ought to have the advantage
in competing for the trade of China, but
Japanese merchants and manufacturers
suffer from inexperience and also from a
streak of. dishonesty and unreliability
which greatly impairs their credit, not
enly in the East, Dut also in Europe and
America. For this reason Japan is doing
her exporting and importing with Euro
pean countries and America through for
eign houses resident in Japan.
The Chinese merchant, on the other
hand, is famous throughout the East for
his commercial honesty. He may cheat
you in making a bargain, but once his
contract is made he holds to it, whether
written or oral. This commercial Integ
rity in a country where the government
Is so corrupt- is due to the fact that in
China, unlike Japan, merchants have al
ways been near the top of the social lad
der.* * Â¦ Â¦ . 'V â¢*.'-',Â¦
Of the foreign trade of China, England
has more than 60 per cent, tine seems,
however, to rest on her past efforts, con
tent with a ilelU won. when thete was lit
tle or no competition. Her manutactur
ers do not realize that goods which have
held the market In tormer years will not
answer* where Germany and Japan are
competing for the same market. The
English merchant says these goods have
answefed im tne past, why make any
changes?
England Marking Time.
Jt is for this reason that, while one
meets in the Kast Kngiish, American and
German merchants, one sees only Russian
officers and officials. It is also ior this rea
son that Russia cannot have the same in
terest in such a reform of the Government
in China as would enable English, Ger
man, American, Japanese and French
merchants to get a permanen; looting in
the interior.
PEKING, May 12.â China's foreign trade
is divided among England, the United
States, Germany and Japan. Russia, al
though she plays the most important part
politically in China, has as yet no trade
which in the least justifies her aggressive
policy. This is due to the fact that as yet
all Industries in Siberia are undeveloped,
and transportation has been so difficult
as to render trade impossible, except by
caravans. The Trans-Siberian Railroad,
now rapidly nearing completion, is In
tended not only as a military Instrument,
but also as a means of opening up Siberia
to the commerce of the East. How eager
ly the Russians are pushing their rdil
road will be understood when it is known
that within a short time the Russian Gov
ernment entered into a contract with a
large English firm in Tientsin to furnish
40,000 coones from China to push the rail
road to ra>)id completion.
Russian interest in China, therefore, Is
purely political. I believe that this? pol
icy has for its purpose the luture frado
necessities of Siuena, but lor the; present
the policy of ltussia must be tne acquisi
tion of territory a.nd governing lniluence,
lather than the expansion or iraue which
she hae not got and cannot acquire for
forty years.

ern men and many of the Western leaders
believe that Roosevelt will be nominated."
"He says he does not want the nomina
tion, and it would be useless to talk of
it," said Mr. Odeil.
Michael J. Dady, who is one of the lead
ing Woodruff boomers, called at the Fifth
avenue Hotel to ace Senator Platt and Mr.
Odell.
Chairman Odell of the Republican State
Committee declined to discuss Governor
Rocsevelfs popularity as a possible candi
date.
â¢Â¦is he not looked upon as a strong man
for second place on the ticket?" was
asked. ' >
"He would be the strongest candidate
who could be named," said Senator Piatt.
"Do you think his nomination Is essen
tial to the success of the ticket?"
"Not absolutely," said Platt.
"Would he accept if he should be nomi
nated by the convention?"
"Of course he would." Mr. Platt said
this as if no alternative could be consid
ered.
"You do not wish to see him forced to
accept?"
"No," was the Senator's reply. "He has
told me that his life would be a burden
to nim as Vice President. The delegation
will meet in Philadelphia, and if it can
agree it "will name a candidate. I suppose
Brooklyn will stand by Lieutenant Gover
nor Woodruff. It docs not necessarily fol
low that New York will name any one.
"I see that General Greene is gaining in
strength," continued Mr. Platt.
"Would General Greene be willing to run
if he should be named?"
. "Of course he would," said Senator
Platt. â¢
Should Governor Roosevelt's name not
be put forward. General Francis V.
Greene may be the New York candidate.
Governor Roosevelt has Senator Platt's
promise that he will not be made the can
didate of a caucus of the New York dele
gates. Though it is generally conceded
that this State can have the second place
on the ticket, there is no certainty that
the delegation will name any candidate.
It' may refuse to agree upon a name. *> In
such an event the representatives of New
York in the convention could hardly avoid
voting for Roosevelt should he be placed
In nomination by some other State.
"All 1 know about the situation is that
Governor Roosevelt says he will not take
the nomination," said Senator Plan to
night.
NEW YORK, June 9.â On the eve of the
meeting- of the Republican National Con
vention there Is a revival among Repub
lican leaders of tne belief that Governor
Theodore Roosevelt will be asked by the
delegates assembled In Philadelphia to ac
cept the nomination for the Vice Presi
dency and that he will not refuse. De
spite his repeated declaration that he doe3
not want the nomination, he remains
most conspicuous and by general consent
the strongest candidate whose name has
been mentioned.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
ROOSEVELT'S
NAME IS AGAIN
BEING MENTIONED
Now, according to treaty, foreign mer
chandise is allowed, by paying an extra
duty at the port of entry, to passuntaxed
from the port of entry to Its final destina
tion. Chinese officials are constantly in
fringing these treaty rights, and so slow
is the diplomatic machinery of redress
that merchants prefer to submit to indi
vidual losses. The abuses of the treaty
regulations in regard to the "likln" taxes
in a great measure diminishes the profits
on trade and discourages merchants.
A further nnd great danger to foreign
trade lies in the Instability of the central
Government and the constant "uprisings
and revolts which the Chinese police and
army ore either unable or unwilling to
suppress promptly. The present hostility
of the Government to foreigners accent
uates the difficulty of developing the Chi
nese market by any other process but
slow wringing of privileges by diplomatic
agents from the unwilling Manchu dy
nasty. If this process is found too slow
for the growing desires of foreigners for
Asiatic commerce, then we may expect the
disruption of China into "spheres of influ
ence, and the predictions are that such
a division would inevitably lead to a great
international war.
Certain dangers Interfere with such a
trade development. In China commerce
and politics are Inextricably interwoven.
According- to the treaties with China, for
eign merchants cannot live in the interior
of the country. All goods therefore pass
from treaty ports directly into the hands
of the Chinese. This would offer no dan
ger to foreign trade were It not for the
"octroi," or "llkln," system under which
China suffers, and the Insufferable greed
of officials. The "llkin" tax is a tax on
goods In transit from the port of entry to
their final destination. It is the most ir
regular and unjust of all Chinese trade
regulations, because it differs In different
parts of China with the Individual greed
of local officials.
Political Obstacles to Trade.
The conclusion that forces itself upon
the observer Is that American commerce
has a tremendous opportunity, in Cathay,
provided the Americanfmerchant throws
himself into the business with -the same
vigor and enterprise which he shows at
home. Â¦ *
lean labor. In China they have to employ
three women for one frame of spindles,
whereas with us one man tends to half
a dozen frames. The wages of one Chi
nese woman may only be 26 cents, aa com
pared to the two or three dollars Of the
American workman, but the fifteen
women required to run six spindles will
draw $4.50 wages.
The Chinese buy this yearn and manu
facture their own cloth. They will not
buy the broad width made by foreigners.
English manufacturers refuse to make
the narrow widths, which would sell In
the Chinese market, on account of the ex
tra expense Involved In setting up new
machinery. It is reported here that next
year certain American manufacturers are
going to make the narrow width of cloth
especially for the Chinese market. If this
be true it shows a new and commendable
enterprise of, our merchants In the East.
In the northern portion of China our
Consuls complain that our merchants are
not so eager to get the China trade that
they are willing to put up their goods in
such packages as the Chinese piece mer
chants desire.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL,, June 9.â The State
Board of Prison Directors held Its regular
monthly meeting at San Quentin to-day.
The principal business transacted was the
acceptance of bids for furnishing supplies
to the prison for the ensuing year. .
There were a great many blda and the
work of the session was not completed.
The contract for furnishing photographic
supplies to the prison was given to Hirsch
& Keiser. Contracts for -groceries and
provisions were - divided between' Mau,
Sadler & Co., H. Levl & Co. and Well
man, Peck & Co. The Golden Eagle Mill
ing Company secured contracts to furnish
bran, barley, wheat ahd oat hay, the lat>
ter being for the delivery of 100' tons at
$8 50 a ton and of No. 1 San Francisco
Produce Exchange standard. Murphy
Grant & Co. secured the dry goods con
tract, the Anglo-American Crockery and
Tea Company was awarded the crockery
and frlass contract, and the oil and paint
bid of W, P. Fuller was accepted.
The coal contract whs not entered Into
becuuse most of the bids were for the fur
nishing of coal, tests of which had never
been made. The board therefore delayed
action on the matter and directed that
small quantities of the new coals be
bought and tested. Warden Aguirre re
ported that a British ship had? arrived
from Calcutta with a cargo of raw Jute.
This, with what Is on hand, will run the
Jute mill until February of next year.

EpÂ»r-!a3 TJiynatrh to The Call.
MONTKREY. June ?.â The effort to se
cure Government aid In the plan of turn
ing Monterey's historic old Custom-house
Into a museum of California history which
has been made during' the present Con-
BTess by the California delegation In
Washington has met with no encourage
ment, and the promoters of the plan feel
that for the present at least the matter
must be abandoned. Representative
Kahn pr*-^cr.ted the matter to the Treas
ury Department and received in reply a
(statement to this effect: The appropria
tion under the control of the department
for the preservation and repair of public
J>uilding:s is so Email that it is found nec
Â¦ Â«Â»ssary to devote the fund exclusively to
the care of buildings now In use for Gov
, crr.rnent business, and that as the Monte
: rey Custom-house has not been used for
public business Fince the discontinuance
-of Monterey as a port of entry no portion
sof this fund could be devoted to putting
The building into the proper condition for
use as a historical museum. Further,
that the department h_> no authority to i
/dedicate the Custom-house to the use de- j
i eired. but it is probable a proposition to I
lease The building for a term of years at j
a nominal rentalâ subject always to the |
Government's demand for possession In
case of need for public usesâ would be fa
.-vorably considered If the persons making
surh a proposition were responsible a.nd
would ur.certake to keep the property in
suitable repair.
There is preat disappointment here over
the outcome of this matter and it Is be-
J'eved an effort will be at once made un
der the auspices of the Society of Cali
fornia Pioneers to lease the Custom-house
and flt it up as a museum of California
history.

the proceedings against tbe Mayor, the
Pock Commissioners and Charles W.
Morsa. president of the American Ice

*_po bÂ«fore Supreme Court Justice Gay
r.or In Erooklya. These proceedings are
designed to ehow what. If any connection
exists between certain city officials and
the ice company.
The Mayor testified that be owned 4200
6__es of the block or the American Ice
Corcpany, whiclj he had obtained from
President Morse, some of It in exchange
for E_ck in the Knickerbocker Ice Com
pary of Maine.
"Did you purchase all this stock subse
quently to becoming Mayor of thÂ© city?"
.Mr. Vaii Wyck was asked.
"I did."
"Why did you purchase stock In the
Knickerbocker Company?"
"Because it was paying 4 per cent on
common aad. 6 per tent oa preferred
stock."
When he made the purchase he did not
know that the American Ice Company in
tended to Co business In New York City.
He had paid for his stock with a check
en the Oarrield National Bank and bor
rowed 75 per cent of the purchase money.
"When vou made the purchase It was
agreed tt_t you should borrow from the
â¢bank?"
"It was."
"Was there asy guarantee to protect
you against, less on that stock?"
"Have you paid back the bank?"
â¢â¢1 have."
"Are you accustomed to such large fl
nanciaJ transactions?"
"1 an."
Fcr the money borrowed the Mayor
F_d he gave four, live aud elx months'
iiotes. lie has paid two notes for $76,uu0
rach, and yesterday paid one cash note
for SaO.tfOO. Continuing, the Mayor said:
"The Interest on me notes was 6 per
cer.t. When 1 made the renewal of the
rote the block of siock was worth JSl.uOO.
but I ecld it yesterday for Jtss.iwO. The
notÂ© called for 575.000. so I lost $7000. I
took no aciive iuterest in the American
Jce Company. I never knew anything
of its management. 1 never knew that
ihe American Jce Company was to have
any monopoly oi the ice business of tha
<itv. I never knew they had any leases.
1 never knew that the ice company stated
to the Stock Exchange that it had a con
tract for eleven aocks in this city.
Dock Commissioner Cram said he had
received 3W shares oÂ£ common stock of the
Knickerbocker Company aa a bonus. He
declared that he had soid all of his stock
in October. 2ST<*. l>ecaur-e he thought tha
matter might come before him in his of
ticial capacny.
"What leases wore made by the Consol
idated Ice Company while you were hold
ing ice stock?"
"We received application for six piers
and I struck out one. then srnt the appli
cation to the treasurer. He struck out
another. Finally v.c made a lease for four
Dock Commissioner Charles F.. Murphy
paid his rpafon for buying s=tocÂ»c in the
Knickerbocker Company was because a
man had eupgeptod suoh a course, it had
never come to him that there was an ob- i
Section against any city official holding
American ice stock. H*Â» got rid of it in
March. IS09. He got ?11.<XÂ») for it. Murphy's
investment in the stock was J10.000.
Vice President John E. Schoomacher of
the American lc<? Company said he had no
personal knov.ledge that the Ice trust fur
nished ice to the city. He only knew the
Mayor by Bight; and kr.etf- Carroll only
Eligntly. The price of ice was advanced
f'om 20 to CO cents because of a short sup
ply.
Mr. Perkham took the examination of
John F. <'arroll in hand personally. Car
in'.l confessed to interest in both the Con
solidated and Knickerbocker companies.
He subscribed for $20.(KÂ» worth of stock
in the Consolidate.?. He paid for It by
check. He had $35,000 worth of stock in
the Knickerbocker Company. He held a
Kook of 2LO0 preferred and a bonus of 2T.00
common In the American Ice Corv'v.
He never knew how much Btor *Â«Â»
Mayor held until to-day. Mr. Carro: M

pace of $1S.5OO, raised on reaJty belonging
to him.
Adjournment was taken until next Sat

THE REVISION OF THE WAR TAX.
WHILE Congress did not succeed in revising
the war tax at the session which has just closed
it gave the subject sufficient consideration to
reach the conclusion that revision is necessary, and
accordingly a committee has been appointed to sit
during the recess for the purpose of devising the best
means of making the revision and of reducing taxes.
From that committee a report is expected as soon as
Congress reassembles, and the people may therefore
be assured the Republican party will lighten the bur
den of war taxes without any delay further than that
required to make the reductions equitably to all con
cerned.
The Democrats will of course attempt to make
something of campaign capital out of the refusal of
the Republicans to .undertake the desired revision
during the recent session. There were, however,
good reasons for the refusal. In the first place, the
bill itself is a complex one, and the interests affected
are many; and in the second place reports made to
Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury were to
the effect that it has been impossible up to this time
to determine what reduction should be made. Under
such circumstances prudence dictated delay until the
subject could be fully investigated and the reductions
made in such a way as to relieve the public of as much
of the burden as can be done without injury to the
treasury and to apportion the relief with fairness to
all concerned.
In making the revision- two duties are imposed
upon the committee. There must be a thorough re
consideration of the 'language of the act so as to
eliminate from it those ambiguities by which the ex
press and the telegraph companies have managed to
escape the payment of : the taxes which . it was the
manifest intention of Congress to impose upon them.
Furthermore, in reducing the taxes care must be ex
ercised to remove those taxes which are most unfair
REPORTS to the effect that Russia has "warned"
the United States not to interfere in China be
yond protecting United States citizens may be
dismissed as emanations of the yellow. /Nothing has
been done by our Government or by our citizens to
justify Russia in giving any advice as to what we
shall do or leave undone, and any such thing as a
"warning" would be an impertinence which no diplo
matist in Russia or elsewhere is likely to venture upon
in dealing with the United States.
There remains, however, the fact that Russia is ap
parently playing a lone hand in China and has plans
which her officers arc not willing to subject to the
action of an international council. That much is made
evident by Admiral Kempff's dispatch of Friday, in
which, after stating that he had landed forces to pro
tect American interests and had sent men to Peking
and Tientsin, that British, Russian and Chinese ad
mirals and twenty warships representing the nations
were in the harbor, he went on to say: "On June 5 the
situation was most critical. The Russian force began
fighting. On June 6 the Tientsin-Peking railway was
cut. Will act in concert with naval forces of other
powers to protect interests if necessary. A meeting of
foreign senior naval officers was held to-day. Present:
English, French, German, Austrian, Italian, Japanese
and American officers. Will arrange for combined
action to protect life and property."
The statement in the dispatch that the Russian
admiral was present in the harbor, that the Russians
had begun fighting, taken in connection with the
omission of the name of any Russian as being pres
ent at the conference of naval officers, looks ominous.
Why the Russian admiral should not have acted in
concert with the others can hardly be explained upon
any ground other than an intention on his part to
have a free hand to act as he will, no matter what
others may do. How far it will be to our interests
to permit the exercise of that free hand on the part
of the Czar remains f o be seen.
RUSSIA PLAYS A LONE HAND.
â¢__,r>ITOR The Call: The frequency
I â¢ with which the Louisiana purchase
p is referred to as a precedent for the
Â¦^^ acquisition of the Philippines shows
'an' amazing ignorance In our own
people of the political history of the coun
try. Political orators cite with frequent
flippancy that act on the part of the Gov
ernment as early establishing the princi
ple of expansion, while the student of
American history must inevitably arrive
at a contrary conclusion. Much of inac
curacy is forgiven by the people and cred
ited to the effervescence of enthusiasm
when listening to an exposition of so
called political principles by perfervid lo
cal statesmen, but when the President of
the United States refers to the Louisiana
purchase as a justification for the recent
acts of expansion many of his most fer
vent admirers fear that a man so well
grounded in political information ap
proaches much nearer the line of polltcal
dishonesty than is creditable to one oc
cupying so exaltjed a position.
The mess we are in with reference to
the Philippines is bad enough without en
deavoring to deceive ourselves by disin
genuous statements and misrepresenta
tion of facts. Even the ordinary reader
of the public press and the listener to pub
lic speeches soon becomes impressed with
how little is known of what the Louisiana
purchase really consisted and the causes
which led up to that treaty with France
in 1803. As far back as 1790 Washington
and the great founders of the republic
who surrounded him were looking with
grave and serious apprehension toward
the mouth of the Mississippi as a danger
point. The hardy sons of the Revolution
with rifle in hand were pouring into the
great Northwestern' Territory, Kentucky
and Tennessee. Steam power was un
known and railroads undreamed of. The
commerce of the world was under sail,
and an outlet to the ocean imperative.
The products of the Mississippi and its
great tributaries must float unvexed to
the sea, and the mouth of that river must
be free. Spain held New Orleans and all
that pathless wilderness and those vast
arid wastes which were afterward known
as the Louisiana purchase. Already com
plications were arising, mutterings and
threats were heard, and It was well known
that the first cause of serious irritation
would send forth a fierce flame, and those
hardy sons of the West, ever too ready
to grasp their only known weapons of de
fense, would precipitate an armed con
flict with any power interfering with their
free entrance to the ocean, and that the
then youthful Government would be ab
solutely powerless to control their actions.
Lines of communication were scarcely
more than paths through trackless for
ests, and the Government might become
involved in war half fought out before a
declaration had been made by either party
and the conflict continue long after terms
of settlement had been reached. To avert
this threatened danger New Orleans was
made by. agreement a port of deposit for
a period of three yearsâ a mere makeshift
â a modus Vivendi. â¢
In 1S00 Spain ceded all its rights to
France, which fact was. however, un
known in this country until the following
year. Jefferson was then President, and
Livingston the Minister to Paris. A con
tinental war was imminent, and Living
ston was instructed to sound Napoleon
then First Consul, with reference to the
purchase of New Orleans. Upon hearing
of the cession to France on April 18, 1802,
Jefferson wrote to Livingston:
"We have ever looked to France as our
natural friend, one with whom we could
never have an occasion of difference, but
there i3 one spot on the globe, the pos
sessor of which is our natural enemyâ
that spot is New Orleans. France placing
herself â¢ In that door, assumes to us the
attitude of defiance. From that moment
we must marry ourselves to the British
fleet and nation."
Monroe was hastened abroad as Envoy
Extraordinary, to assist in the negotia
tions. Mabol3, acting for the First Con
sul In place of Talleyrand, suggested to
Livingston a purchase by the United
States of all of the rights of France for
twenty millions of dollars. The answer
of the American representative was an
emphatic noâ expansion was not thought
ofâ all his Government wanted was New
Orleans, and a free entry to the sea
However, upon the arrival of Monroe with
his broader Â¦Â¦ and more comprehensive
views and fuller information, the negotia
tions were again taken up upon the basis
of.Mabols' suggestions and an agreement
promptly reached and a treaty entered into
for the sale of all the rights of France
for eighty millions of francs. This treaty
was promptly ratified by theFirst Consul
and in October following by the Senate
of the United States by a majority of ten
more â¢ than , tho requisite two-thirds. The
treaty provided that all the inhabitants
of the ceded territory, should" become in-
corpora'ted into the United States with
all the rights and privileges of citizenship.
At that time the people occupying the
ceded territory probably did not number
one for each hundred square miles, and the
treaty was simply a stupendous real estate
deal. What few inhabitants there were
were comprised of French and Spanish,
living thousands of miles from the pro
tecting influence of their Government and
surrounded by hordes of bloody savages
over which there existed no sovereignty
even in name. All this territory lay con
tiguous to the United States and extend
ing westward from the Mississippi to a
point where the waters would now into
the Pacific ani from Canada to the gulf
and Rio Grande, with boundaries unde
fined and in dispute, Including the mouth
of the Mississippi, which river was the
very lifeblood ot the commerce of it and
all its tributaries. A war with the then
greatest military power on earth was al
most inevitable, a wilderness with prac
tically no population, but all a territory
which by American people could be turned
into a prosperous and productive part of
our own country.
The mouth of the Mississippi In the pos
session of a foreign power was a stand
ing menace and a ? perpetual threat.
Among the causes that prompted that
purchase the idea of expansion had no
place or Influence, nor was it even for
a i;:iraent claimed to be within the es
preÂ£sÂ£d constitutional powers of the Pres
ident and Senate to make such purchase,
and but few of those who most severely
criticized the constitutional right of the
Government to make the acquisition ever
for a moment questioned the policy and
necessity of the same. It was an act
done not only for the conservation of the
best Interests of our own people but was
one within the inherent powers of any
government to protect Itself, and may
Â¦well be considered the exercise of a war
power, a power which is exercised by all
nations. Around each inhabitant of the
ceded territory by a treaty, the most sol
emn obligations known to civilized gov
ernments, we tucked the mantle of the
constitution and clothed him wiÂ»h every
right of American citizenship. Out of
that purchase we carved great States,
which are now filled with millions of in
telligent and prosperous American peo
ple, the combined wealth of whose com
merce and agriculture inimitably surpasses
the wealth of the entire thirteen colonies
when they first defied the power of Eng
land and created the American flag. No
one, however rich in romance or however
great a Utopian dreamer, could conceive
of men with statesmanship sufficiently
wise, broad and comprehensive to have
averted a war between the United States
and any foreign power which might have
held the mouth of the Mississippi for the
first third of the nineteenth century. To
insure the development of that vast coun
try so rich In resources, washed by the
Mississippi and its tributaries, an outlet
to the sea was an absolute and impera.
tlve necessity, and it was a statesman
ship which accomplished that result, per
meated by no selfish motive of expansion,
and which was sufficiently farseeing to
avert threatened war with any power that
might in any wise interfere with an un
trammeled outlet to the sea. How can
these motives and all the conditions and
circumstances surrounding that treaty be
even suggested as a precedent for the ac
quisition of the Philippines?
\It is true we were at war with Spain â
right or wrong â but we had the solemn
declaration of the American Congress
that the war was not undertaken for the
purpose of conquest, but solely for hu
manity. By an accident, an American
fleet found Spanish ships in the- bay of
Manila, over which, together with the
surrounding islands, Spain had held a
nominal sovereignty for 300 years,- and
most of that time in armed conflict with
the people. We were at war with Spain,
not with her rebellious subjects who
claimed the right of self-government in
accordance with their own ideas; but the
destruction of the Spanish fleet in Philip
pine waters surely gave us no right to
continue the crusade against those peo
ple, who might well be considered our
allies, rather than our enemies, and after
having driven the fox away we certainly
had no right to rob the roost.
Probably not 5 per cent of the American
people prior to May 1, 1898. would have
been able to find the Philippine Islands
upon a map of the world. Seven thousand
miles from our shores, across stormy and
tempestuous seas, were ten million peo
ple of Oriental races, and with whom the
blood of, the Anglo-Saxon never did and
never will commingle; a people who in
centuries would not understand the genius
of our institutions, a people against whom
the American Congress has for years vig
orously and rigorously legislated to pre
vent their entering our doors, and it is
now claimed that the acquisition of that
country and of those people and under
those conditions is justified by the Louisi
ana purchase, and it is cited as a prece
dent, committing the American Govern
ment to the policy of expansion. What a
travesty on common sense! We acquired
them and their countrv by the treaty, of
Paris, and for what? Evidently if we are
to retain. them we are to do so solely for
the purpose of furnishing them a good
government. Certainly the destruction of
a fleet belonging to their enemy and oura
in their waters imposed no such obligation
upen us. Even the boldest supporter of
the policy of expansion will not suggest
that we are to maka of the Filipinos
American citizens, with all the rights and
privileges of American citizenship. He
fore the words of a politician that Â¦would
advance such a doctrine had died upon,
the circumambient air he would find his
political neck dislocated. We have ac
quired a country so far away that from
our nearest shores it takes thirty days by
steam to reach it. We have acquired the
obligation to maintain large standing
armies, with all Its concomitant evils,
and in direct violation of the fundamental
principles of this Government. "We havo
acquired a guerrilla, -warfare that -will
leave thousands of bright and bravo
Americans sleeping their last sleep In the
swamps and amid the rice fields of that
tropic clime, and making physical and
mental wrecks of still other thousands.
We have already accumulated a larga
supply of political scandals. We are ex
ercising government without the consent
of the governed and are trampling under
foot every tradition of the American re
public, and for what? The right to gov
ern aitf alien race and to speculate upoa
the products of their labor.
By the one treaty we were conserving
the interests of our own people, building
up a country where peace, happiness,
plenty and profit would reign supreme,
where the dpmain acquired would add
power and prestige to the integrity of tha
nation. On the other hand, we are simply
Involving ourselves in the complications
which will Inevitably arise in the Orient,
adding; millions to the expense of our
treasury, increasing our list of dead, fill
ing our pension rolls and leaving to suc
ceeding generations unsolved problems to

timbers of the republic. No nation can

OUR PHILIPPINE ACQUISITIONS
FORESTS OR FAMINES.
BY reason of the appalling nature of the famine
in India the attention of men* of science has
been directed to a study of the forces and con
ditions which produced it. It is of course apparent
that the famine is due to the drought and the drought
due to the lack of rain, but that explanation does not
satisfy men v.ho arc accustomed to look beneath the
surface of things in the search for primary causes. In
this case the study discloses the startling fact that the
Indian famines are increasing in frequency and in
magnitude; the present one is far more disastrous
than any that preceded it. There must be some law
at work to produce these appalling effects, and in the
estimation oi some eminent authorities that law is to
be found in the relation of forests to water supply. In
ether words, famines in India are due to the destruc
tion of forests and increase as that destruction ex
tends.
Prior to the establishment of British law in India
a large portion of the country, was uncultivated. When
order was firmly fixed and industry was sure of pro
tection the old woods and jungles were cleared away
over wide tracts of country, and as a result the natural
reservoirs of moisture were destroyed. Thus there is
now less of water storage in the land than in former
years. A temporary failure of the rains in their sea
son leaves the country parched and barren and a
famine spreads over the land.
It is stated that something of the same evil is to be
observed working its way along the Nile. British
control has made fanning profitable far up the river
and the work of forest destruction has begun there
with the inevitable result. Furthermore it is asserted
that even the seemingly inexhaustible forests of Cen
tral Africa, in the basin of the Congo, have been so
wasted by the ax and by fire within the short time of
European occupation that the effect on the water
astern of the country is already noticeable.
Commenting upon the statements of these authori
ties the New York Tribune points out the significance
to us and says: "These lessons, all three of them, are
directly applicable to the United States. We have
actually known famine in some of the Western States
through the malign effects of drought. Some of our
streams are dwindling as in the Nile, and threaten to
vanish entirely as those of the Sahara have done. And
if in the stupendous arboreal wilderness of the Congo
it is becoming necessary to devise protective meas
ures, what shall be said of such necessity in a country
so recklessly denuded of its woodlands as our own?
The laws of nature cannot be violated with impunity.
She gave the forests as mediums'of natural irrigation.
If we destroy the means we lose the end. The law is
inexorable. Men now see trickling rills where in
their boyhood they saw full brimming streams. And
they nlso sec bare, sun-scathed hillsides where then
they saw dense, primeval forests. It is cause and
ctTect, nothing more. But should not rational men
learn the lesson?"'
There is to be edded the one fact that to no part of
the Union is forest preservation more vital than to
this State. With us the issue is one of imperative
urgency. A famine in California would sound
strangely indeed, and yet. to another generation it
will be familiar if something be not done to check the
waste of our woodlands and protect the natural reser
voirs of our winter rains.
RECENTLY published statistics of the Postal
Savings Bank of Great Britain make the para
doxical showing that the thrift of the British
v/orkingman has reached a point where it has almost
become unthrifty, and the Postal Savings Bank has
saved up so much capital for use in commerce that it
has well nigh rendered capital unprofitable by re
ducing the rate of interest.
It appears there are now about 8,000,000 depositors
in the postal savings banks of the kingdom, and that
the sum of their deposits is about $750,000,000. Upon
that vast sum the Government As at present paying
interest at the rate of 2y 2 per cent, but has not been
able to find an investment for all the money, and con
sequently there was Isst year a deficit of about $250,
000, which had to be made up out of taxes.
Such being the condition of the banks, a discussion
lias arisen concerning the. expediency of maintaining
them, and the issue will soon be brought before Par
liament. It is argued on one side that it is unfair for
the Government to offer 2^ per cent interest to de
positors in the savings banks when it has no use for
the money; when it can borrow at less rates all the
money it needs; and when it has to impose taxes
upon the whole people in order to be able to pay in
terest to the '8,000,000 savings bank depositors, com
posing as they do hardly more than one-fifth of the
population.
Upon tire other side it is argued that the very fact
that the Government has this immense sum of sav
ings in the postal banks to borrow from enables it to
float its loans as cheaply as it does, and therefore
that the bank is worth to the Government all that it
cost last year to maintain it. Furthermore, it is ar
gued it is the duty of the Government to promote
the welfare of the people by encouraging thrift as the
postal bank docs. Finally it is said that since the
Government imposes taxes for the purpose of grant
ing bounties for mail service or subsidies for ship
building and in other ways aids the enterprises of
capital, it is no more than right that taxation should
be resorted to if necessary to uphold the savings in
stitutions of vyorkingrrieri and provide them with a
fair interest upon their deposits.
The issue, it will be seen, is one of the most inter
esting of the financial problems of our time when con
sidered from the point of view of sociology. Clearly
it is bad economy for a Government to maintain a
postal bank system upon which it loses $250,000 that
it has to make up by taxation. On the other hand
it is certainly an advantage for a Government to have
$750,000,000 offered by its workingmen at such low
rates of interest, and it is also of advantage to pro
vide workingmen with a means of investing their sav
ings without risk of losing them through bank fail
ures or speculations. The discussion in Parliament
will enlighten us how to act when the time comes for
entering upon the establishment of postal banks in
this country, and for that reason the subject is worthy
of general attention.
BRITISH POSTAL SAVINGS.
THE many friends of Robert Taber will be sorry to hear
that he has been playing Marcus Vinicius in the Lon
don version of "Quo Vadis." That Is a sad corr.e-down
for an artist of Mr. Taber's standing, and It is sin
cerely to be hoped that the pressure of necessity â it
must' have been a dire one â which drove him to such slavery
will soon b*s relieved, allowing him to reserve his fine talent
for that work for which he is so eminently fittedâ the por
trayal of poetic and romantic characters. I count it among the
blessings of my life that I have steadily resisted all entreaties
to read "Robert Elsmere" and that I could not be induced to
see "Quo Vadis." For this latter mercy I am indebted to the
friendly warnings of a much-berated classâ the critics. They
saved me, as I humbly trust that I on similar occasions have
saved others. I have bc\>n waiting for an authoritative judg
ment on this detestable play from the man most competent to
give it, and here I find it in the London "World of May 16:
Â« â¢ â¢ "The brutalities of the play are not so crude and pal
pable as those of the "Sign of the Cross.' In the main, how
ever, there is very little to choose between the two productions,
and some passages of 'Quo Vadis' are positively unrivaled In
point of childish absurdity."
The June Century contains a beautiful picture of the grave
of Edwin Booth, with the following quatrain by Thomas Bailey
Aldrich:
In narrow space, with Booth, He housed in death
Iagr>. Hamlet, Shylock, Lear, Macbeth.
If still they seem to walk the painted scene,
'Tis but the ghosts of those that once have been.
This Is as true historically as poetically. "We have to-day
but two actors on the American stage who can give what may
be called a fairly adequate representation of a great Shake
spearean partâ Mr. James and Mr. Mansfield. The former ex
cels in only one part. Othello; the latter has never, I think, at
tempted anything but Richard III.
. t . * . â¢ Â» . â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Archer's recent articles on "The American Stage" (Pall
Mall Magazine) afford us a rare chance to see ourselves as
others see us. The most obviously ugly fact about that stageâ
the hideous exterior of our average theater â naturally im
presses him first. To one who has seen the Grand Opera-house
in Paris and the Ring Theater in Vienna, the Metropolitan
Opera-house in New York must appear as it did to Mr. Archer
nothing better than a yellow brick factory. Indeed, it may
truthfully bt said that of the forty odd playhouses in New
York only two â the American Theater on Forty-second street
and the Madison-square Gardenâ show the faintest conception
of what a theater exterior should be like. True, London is no
better off in this respect than New York. There too often, as
with us, one and the same roof extends its shelter over saloon
(Anglice gin palace) and theater, an outward and visible sign
of the Inward and spiritual disesteem which places poor Thalia
and Melpomene at the bottom of the Muse's social scale.
The interior of our playhouses Mr. Archer finds better than
the exterior: indeed, it seems to me he hardly does justice in,
this respect to their superiority over the English. The pit, that
odious survival from days of cock-fighting and bear-baiting. 13
fortunately unknown among us, while it has by no means dis
appeared In England. The interior decoration, too. all that
gives cheerfulness and "atmosphere" to an auditorium, is bet
ter understood, it seems to me, in New York than in London.
"When Mr. Archer projected his plan for a visit to the thea
ters of America some cultivated Americans, he tella us. asked
him. "What came you out into the wilderness to see?" Ilia
reply was. "I came to look into the future of the Kngllsh
drama." That is a lovely thing for him to say, as is also h!3
remark about our public "advancing by leaps and bounds In
culture and taste." Lovely things to say, indeed, but alas! far.
I fear, from the truth. If we swallow them we shall End them
like unto the little book commanded by the angel to be eaten
of St. John: "And I took the little book out of the angel's
hand and ate it up; and it was In my mouth sweet as honey;
and as soon as I had eaten it my stomach was hitter." For
the time when the center of literary activity shall move from
London to New York is. If we may judge by historical analo
gies, so remote as to have no practical interest for us, and a3
to culture "advancing by leaps and bounds"â not only Is culture
not doing that among us but it has never done that among any
people. Culture, "the best that is thought and known In the
world," Is a plant of slow growth. To use a Tennysonlan
metaphor, even where nature has planted fifty seeds thereof,
she often brings but one to life, choking out the other forty
nine by means of the weeds of passion and materialism.
With the plaint that lays at the door of Charles Frohman
the responsibility for the sickly condition of our drama Mr.
Archar cannot sympathize. "It Is the public." he says, "not
Mr. Frohman, that is to blame. So long as the public fails to
discriminate between native and foreign work no manager,
whatever his race or creed, can afford to constitute himself iho
Maecenas of the native playwright." That Is, of couse, unfor
tunately true, and in the use of the word "Maecenas" Mr.
Archer has indicated the best- hope for the future of our
drama. It is quite absurd to expect people to discriminate be
tween good and bad so long as they do not know what Is good
and what is bad; this they can learn only by seeing the good
constantly presented, and to present this good in proper shape
means financial loss during the period it takes to educate your
public. The time cries out for a millionaire who la willing
cheerfully to sustain this loss. If there is one such man in the
United States he has not yet answered the cry.
Mr. Archer considers American acting quite as good as
English. Against the matinee girl he brings the heavy charga
of being responsible for the success of such a "vulgarly violent
amour" as Zaza and such a piece of tawdry sentiment as
Catherine. At the* conclusion of his article he harks back again
to what is really at the bottom of the whole question â public
opinion. The true provincialism, he justly declares, is that
which is content to leave America a province of France and
New York a suburb of Paris. I* DU PONT SYLE.

BRYAN AND THE BOERS.
DOWN in Indiana when a politician begins talk
ing for effect, without heartfelt sentiment or
good horse sense in what he says, the plain
people dismiss him with the remark that "he is
The homely domestic phrase is derived from the
condition of a cider barrel when it is nearly all drawn
and bits of pomace and dregs begin to run through
the faucet. These have to be emptied out, and hence
are emptyings, and when a barrel runs "emptyins" it
means that the good cider is all gone.
Mr. Bryan has been suspected of having exhausted
whatever ideas he had in stock when he began his
career of volubility. Those ideas were not of very
good quality, and the "emptyins" that went with them
were, of course, as much inferior to the dregs that go
with a higher class of ideas as the dump of a lime
kiln is inferior to that of a gold mine afflicted* with a
telluride combination.
The intelligent anti-expansionists of this country
have not been edified by Bryan's anti-expansion
views, nor, has any thoughtful person been impressed
by the mushy splutter in which his pro-Boer views
have sought expression. He has pretended that our
Government could side, efficiently, with the Boers,
when he knows, if he knows anything, that to repeat
the action o # f France in our Revolution can be done
only by paying the price France paid for the alliance,
and that was a war with England. If Bryan would
ever be frank and honest with the people, the proper
measure of his principles and capacity would be more
generally taken. If he desire to carry out the in
sinuations and half-expressed intentions which he has
uttered, let him frankly declare that, if elected Presi
dent, he will demand that England restore the inde
pendence of the Orange Free State and the Trans
vaal, and will advise Congress to meet her refusal with,
a declaration of war. Unless he has this policy in
view and would carry it out, all his thespian and
heroic declarations of sympathy and criticisms of the
Republican party are "emptyins," nothing more.
Ever}' intelligent American knows that unless our
Government \z willing to go to war for the Boers, as
a Government it can positively do nothing for them
at all. Our people can express sympathy for the re
publics and they do so, heartily. They can contribute
funds, and have done so. They can enlist and fight
under the Boer flag, and have done so, violating no
law provided they omit the formality of enlistment
until after they leave our jurisdiction. But our Gov
ernment mustf stand neutral unless it is ready to de
clare a Boer alliance, which will be. also a declaration
of war against Great Britain. If this is what Bryan
proposes let him say so. It is all that he can do, and
the only thing that he can do, as President, of the
least benefit to the Boers. All other talk is for effect,
to influence votes, to get support by a false pretense.
In one of his late interviews he said he hoped the
Boers would migrate to this country to defend us
again?t imperialism, and intimated that room would
be made for them by expelling members of the Re
publican party for sympathy with Great Britain. This
is not only demagogic talk, it is the drivel of a weak
ling. The free people of the United States have al
ways defended their own liberties and are quite ca
pable of doing so now, without inviting strangers
from any quarter to do it for them.
There is no evidence that Republicans any more
than Democrats have sympathized with Great Brit
ain's side of the South African quarrel. Morgan and
Pettus, two of Bryan's Senators, have steadily voted
against any Congressional expression of sympathy for
the Boers. Within the last six weeks the Bryan party
in Alabama at its primaries has indorsed Morgan for
re-election by a vote of more than two to one. Why
not get some Boers to go to Alabama, the birthplace
of the slave-holding Confederacy, and help maintain
liberty against imperialism on the ground where Great
Britain is indorsed by a vote of two to one of Bryan's
own party?
Mr. Bryan will find that he cannot wheedle people
out of votes to make him President by these flat
headed criticisms of the Republican party. He must
declare what he would do under the same circum
stances. Would he make this country head a Euro
pean concert in demanding of England the indepen
dence of the Dutch republics? If so, will he explain
what becomes of the Monroe doctrine when he re
moves its counterbalance in the non-interference in
European affairs by this country? The Boer envoys
have been instructed to say that such a European
concert under the leadership of the United States is
what they expected. In all sympathy for their un
fortunate situation, ;ve must insist that this Govern
ment could do nothing of the kind. That is just
as well understood in Europe as it here. Nor, if
n European concert had been organized to address an
identical note to Great Britain in behalf of the Boer?,
could this country in any way interfere, by any sup
port of England, for that would also be a repudiation
of the Monroe doctrine.
Let Mr. Bryan wring out his handkerchief, wept
wet with sympathy for the Boers, and tell what he
would have done in their behalf differently from Presi
dent McKinley.
in their burdens upon the people and which occasion
well founded discontents. r';, ;v
There is a strong sentiment in favor of a repeal of
the stamp duties, and a particularly strong support
is given to a proposition to repeal the tax upon pro
prietary medicines and other articles of a similar na
ture. It has been pointed out that all stamp taxes are
a source of vexation, and especially those on tele
grams and express receipts, where the irritation is
aggravated by the consciousness on the part of the
public that the burden has been shirked by the cor
porations. These proposals in the way of reform
have been repeatedly urged in the East and may be
safely left to the people of that section. There is one
tax which rests lightly upon the East but is a heavy
one in California that ought to be' urged by our dele
gation in Congress upon the attention of the com
mittee, and that is the tax upon wine served in
bottles. In the East there is produced very little
table wine and not much is consumed there, but in
California, where wine is served with lunch and din
ner at the popular restaurants and forms a common
article of diet among the people, the tax is a compara
tively heavy one. Moreover, it is an unfair tax, since
it does not fall equally upon all the people of the
Union. It is a tax upon California rathe- ' .1 upon
the country at large, and it is to be hoped tuvi â¢ ; sion
committee will remove it along with all other unjust
features of the act.

the pupils of Henry Heyman. A good
programme was rendered, including the
Max Bruch G minor Concerto (allegro
moderato and Romance) and the Ro

Concerto pf Wieniawski. Much Interest
was taken in the first appearance of Mas

from Oakland, who played with charm

and technique a "Mazurka" and "Taran

sister of the small genius, also plays well,
her style, bowing and interpretation com
paring favorably with most of the older
pupils. Maurice Rose gave a good read

Bruch numbers, and the Wieniawski
Concerto was well rendered, Xrom the
same viewpoint, by C. F. Hamlin. Miss
Parker, to whom is forgiven the De Be

THREATENED DEPUTY
GAME COMMISSIONER
Men on McCloud River Resent Being
Arrested for Violating the
State Laws.
L. X. Kercheval, Deputy Fish and Game
Commissioner, has Just returned from
Redding and the McCloud River district,
where he had an exciting experience for
a few days. Complaint had been made at
the office In this city that one of the elec
tric power companies erecting a plant on
the river was feeding deer meat to its
workmen. As the open season for the kill
ing of deer ls some time off Mr. Kercheval
was detailed to attend to the complaint,
and he arrested Wash Harding, the cook
of the camp, and H. W. Weldon and F. W.
Fortna, who run the* camp feedhouse, for
having deer- meat in their possession out
of season. He took' the men to Redding
for trial. â¢ He learned that the men who
killed the game were very cautious and
that their discovery would be difficult.
The arrested parties and their friends
were very ugly over the arrests, and Ker
'cheval was informed that If he went back
into the mountains he would be "done
up." The deputy was not to be fright
ened, and on the following day he re
turned to the scene, but his search for the
men who killed the game was of no avail.
MAY ASSIGN SIXTY-FIVE
PUPILS TO ONE CLASS
Teachers Much Exercised Over Con
templated Revision of a School
Board Rule.
The local schoolteachers are very much
evercised over the rumor that the Board
of Education, which is at present revising
the rules. Intends to place the minimum
attendance of pupils In the classes at
sixty-five. It Is contended that this rule
will result in the dismissal of a large
number of teachers, notwithstanding
Director Denman's repeated assertion
that no teachers will lose their positions,
but that all will be taken care of.
The School Board as soon as it assumed
office set about to consolidate classes
wherever the average of attendance was
considered too low. In Its earnest desire
to reduce expenses and anxiety to have a
surplus In its funds, classes were abol
ished and several teachers found them
selves on the unasslgned list. The local
pedagogues Bee in the mathematical rule
of sixty-five pupils to a class a conse
quent diminution of the number of
schoolteachers. At present there are 1027
teachers in the department, with twenty
seven on the unassigned list. Many
classes have but forty-five pupils, and the
teachers say they have all they can
do to handle that number properly.
Should sixty-five pupils be assigned to a
class it would result in doing away with
at least a hundred teachers.
Superintendent Webster is strongly op
posed to the contemplated plan, and says
that the discipline of the scholars will be
materially impaired If the minimum limit
of attendance Is fixed at sixty-five in each
class. He will endeaver to bring about
a change of base in that connection on
the part of the School Directors.

ST. PETER'S PARISHIONERS
PREPARE FOR AN OUTING
the boats, but the men only succeeded in
saving the clothes they wore. The general
supposition is that the bark was in charge
of a pilot and that she was run on the
rocks in very thick weather.
About the year 1SS3-S7 three of the best
wooden vessels ever turned out of the
Bath (Me.) shipyards came to the Pacific
Coast. They were the ships Gatherer,
Harvester and Reaper. All of them came
to this coast and the Harvester and Gath
erer soon found purchasers in this city.
Both of them were changed into barks
and have been trading from San Francisco
and Puget Sound ports e\tf since.
The Harvester left Chemftlnus, B. C, for
Cape Town with a load of lumber on No
vember 23, li>93. On March 9 she reached
her destination, but it was late in April
before her cargo was discharged. On
April 29 she was ballasted and ready tor
sea, and the next day Bhe sailed for New
castle. Australia, where she was to load
coaj for Honolulu. The old craft made
a quick run across the Pacific, only, how-,
ever, to lay her bones on the Seal Rocks
at the entrace of the harbor to which she
was bound.
The Harvester was built at Bath, Me.,
In 1*75 by E. & A. Sewall. She was 1373
tons net burden. 210 feet long, 29 feet 7
inches beam and 24 feet deep. A. P. Lor
entzen of this city was the managing
owner, but there were about a dozen peo
ple interested in the vessel. There was
very little insurance on the hull, and the
loss will come heavily on several people.
Transport Grant Arrives.
The United States army transport Grant
arrived from Manila via Nagasaki yester
day. She came in with a clean bill of
health, but as there were a great num
ber of Bick soldiers aboard Dr. Kinyoun
thought It best to send the vessel Into
quarantine. The only report that came
ashore was to the effect that there had
been three deaths during the voyage from
non-contagrious diseases, and that there
remained aboard 51 cabin passengers, 364
Bick and discharged soldiers and 146 pris
oners. Among the sick are eighteen in
sane men.
Captain Buford also reported that forty
miles -west of the Farallones he passed a
fleet of twelve vessels, all heading for San
Francisco. This will probably turn out to
be the fleet of overdue sugar vessels re
ported In yesterday's Call. Four of them
made port before sundown and the re
mainder will probably get. In to-day. The
vessels that got in were the ship E. B.
Sutton, 24 days from Honolulu; schooners
Helene. 22 days, and Transit. 24 days from
Honolulu, and schooner O. M. Kellogg, 2S
days from Mahukona. The arrival of the
fleet will be gladly welcomed at the re
fineries, as the supply of the raw material
has been getting very low during the past
week.
Ahern's Hard Luck.
Sailing of the Protet Delayed.
When a man only gets one Sunday off
in a month he likes to make the mpst of
it, and if necessity compels him to labor
even on that one day of rest he always
expects to be let off with a light Job. The
very opposite is the state of aftairs in the
case of Customs Inspector D. J. Ahem,
however, and yesterday Dan quoted with
a sad smile on his face to his companion
In misery. Inspector McGinnis, "Blessed
are they that expect nothing, for they
shall not be disappointed."
"But we are getting something," pro
tested Mac. "Isn't this odor sublime?
Why. man, your whiskers .won't require
perfuming for a month to come."
The cause of the two Custom-house of
ficers' woe was a large consignment of
raw hides that came from Australia on
the Bteamer Mariposa. Dr. Kinyoun
would not allow them to be landed at any
of the tanneries unless they were put into
the cleaning vats under the supervision of
the Custom-house inspectors. Ahem and
McGinnis were detailed for the job, and
yesterday when the hides were loaded
aboard the scow C. T. Place they set sail
for Redwood City, where the cargo is to
be discharged. If all goes well they may
reach their destination by Monday, and by
that time they will know all about hides
and also something about life on a bay
schooner.
The French cruiser Protet was to have
railed for Hongkong via Yokohama yes
terday, but owing to an accident it will be
to-morrow or Tuesday before she gets
away. While the warship was being:
coaled several cases of kerosene were
burst open and the oil scattered over the
black diamonds. As the korosene and coal
would nave quickly Ipnlted when the ves
eel cot in a seaway, all the fuel which had
come in contact with the oil had to be re
moved from the bunkers. This necessi
tated a great deal of work, and in conse
quence the Protet could not leave port.
To-morrow Â«he will take aboard a number
of oxen and sheep and Â£hen as soon ' as
everything is in readiness* a start for
Hongkong will be made. The Protet is a
modern cruiser, on her maiden voyage,
and will be a welcome addition to the
French fleet in Asiatic waters.
Fire on Broadway Wharf.
The offices of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company on Broadway wharf were
considerably damaged by fire and water
yesterday. Luckily all the books and rec
ords of the concern were got out of the
burning building in time, so shippers will
not be inconvenienced. ,
The fire was discovered about 1 p. m.
It had evidently been started by a lighted
cigar thrown under the building by somÂ«
careless smoker. State Collector T.t C.
Ryan at once notified "Captain Browrs;

ADVERTISEMENTS.ROBERT LOCKE, recently Asso
ciated Press correspondent in the
Philippines, committed suicide
yesterday morning in his room in
the Occidental Hotel by shooting himself
through the heart with a bullet fromÂ»a
28-callber Colt's army revolver. He *ad
led a dissipated life, and his, mind being
warped from overindulgence in alconol,
he could not withstand the strain of his
self-created poverty and ended his life.
His father and mother reside in Chicago,
and his wife is visiting friends ln Paris.
Locke was the son of Rev. Clinton E.
Locke, a well-known clergyman, who had
held the position of rector of Grace Epis
copal Church ln Chicago for many years
and who recently retired. The suicide
had received a good education and prac
ticed as a physician in Chicago for sev
eral years. .He was obliged to abandon
his profession because of his craving for
strong drink. .He then accepted the po
sition of Associated Press correspondent,
ln which capacity â¢ he went to Manila
eighteen months ago.* He returned to
this city on the transport Thomas when
she reached this port last and took up his
quarters at the Occidental Hotel. Shortly
afterward he -was taken with an attack
of delirium tremens and was removed
to St. Luke's Hospital for ' treatment.
On . Wednesday last he returned to the
hotel and began another spree. â¢
His mother had sent him $150 a short
time ago, and that sum was speedily
spent, after which he wrote to Rev.
George S. Meade. principal of the Trinity
School, asking for a loan, but Mr. Meade
was unable to accommodate/ him.
Locko, in his quest for money, called
last Friday upon his friend. Lieutenant
George T. . Xewhall at the Palace Hotel,
and, unpercelved- by the lieutenant, took
from the mantelpiece a Colt's army re
volver and slipped it into his pocket.
. A chambermaid at 7:15 yesterday morn
ing found Locke's dead body in bed. The
revolver lay on the floor, close to the
right hand of the dead man. Blood on
his breast and the bullet-hole * told the
rest of the story. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
Ko Confidence in Police Courts.
The poundmaster's deputies were ln
trouble with a citizen again yesterday
morning. Deputies Danz and Hughes at
tempted to capture a dog which was with
out a license tag on Kearny and Market
streets, when the owner appeared and
Jumped upon the net which had been cast
over the animal. The poundraen, dog
owner and dojr were badly mixed in a
second and a big crowd gathered. Two
policemen escorted the men to the office
of the SocJoty for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals, which has charge of the
pound, and the situation was explained.
The policemen arked Secretary Holbrook
If be wanted the dog owner arrested. Hol
brook replied that it was of no use to take
anv violators of the law to the Police
Courts for Interfering with an officer ln
the discharge of his duty when a case
Is dismissed ln which the deputies were
held up by a man with a loaded shotgun.
ROBERT LOCKE, Physician and Press Correspondent.
If Thomas W. Flannelly. who murdered
tis father ln Redwood City on October
12, 1SS7, and afterward sped the bullet that
, ended the life of Sheriff McAvoy, hangs
>it will be with the sanction of the Su
-prcme Court of the United States. Flan
' r.elly was convicted of murder in the first
degree and the judgment has been af
firmed by the State Supreme Court,
Beany. Temple and Henshaw dissenting.
The case will now be taken to the Su
preme Court of the United State* on a
writ of error for final judgment.
Attomey Louis P. Boardman, who has
represented Flannelly since his convic
tion, will leave to-morrow morning for
"Washington to make the final appeal for
nls client's life. Boardman will make
the fight on three questions involving
rights granted the people under the con
stitution of the United States. It Is con
tended that at the preliminary examina
tion the defendant was denied the right
of counsel and that as this right was one
of the prerequisites established by the
Hurtado case as to the validity of pro
ceedings by information where no indict
ment has been found" the point is one
which furnishes a question Involving the
rights of the defendant under the Federal
law and the decision of the United States
Bupreme Court, which fixed the limits of
proceedings by information under the
California law.
It is further claimed that as the com
mon law Grand Jury system is in force
and a part of the law of California., and
as the Grand Jury of San Mateo County
was in Ecsfion and proceeding to investi
Â»atÂ« the case against Flannelly when the
district Attorney tiled the information,
the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to
procf-ed under the Information until the
Grand Jury had completed its investiga
tion and returned an indictment or ig
nored the charge, as it had the right to do
tinder the constitution and laws of Cali

Insurance Commissioner A. J. Clunia
and Building and Loan Associations Com
missioners Frank H. Gould and E. D.
McCabe have declared the TontlnÂ« Sav
ings Association to be a gambling and
lottery scheme of the most vicious char
acter. They have requested of the At
torney General permission to usÂ© the
name of the people ln an action to prevent
the association from the further trans
action of business within this State. Ac-
cording to its representations tho Ton
tine Savings Association claims to be a
corporation organized under the laws of
Minnesota. It also claims to have beea
ln the mutual investment business BlncÂ»
January. 1S34. issuing contracts, etc x
According to these agreements the con
tract holder pays a certain small sum of
money per week for a stated period, and
when the contract reaches the order ot
redemption the association Is to deliver
to the holder valuable diamonds, retail
ing from $200 down, according to tho num
ber of weeks during which money haa
been paid. The State officers made an
Investigation of the Tontine business and
found that it was not being conducted
under any law or license or supervision
of either State commission, although Its
contract system comes closely under the
provisions of both Insurance and building ,
and loan laws. The Tontine peopitJ
claim that the company is exempt frora
the provisions of the law governing either
and that its sole business is that of a
"retail dealer in diamonds" making sales
upon the installment plan.
A.3 to this pretention, the Commission
ers in their letter to Attorney General
Ford for permission to begin action, say:
To this claim we have given the most careful
consideration, and as a resuÂ»t are firmly of tha
opinion that Its claim of beir.c a dealer in dia
'monUs is a mere pretense .rfj-ur.-.M by It for the
purpose of hindering and Â¦fcefeatmg the tewa of
i the sjtate and an attempt on ita pirt to tieO.it
the enforcement of the laws of tnis and other
States and to attemnt to evade the laws of thÂ«
! United States prohibiting the use of the mail*
ror any purpose connected with the operation
of a lottery or scheme in the nature ol a lot
tery. .
From our examination of its affairs we pro
nounce It to be a gambling device of the most
vicious nature, holding out to tho speculating
public .visionary promises impossible of per
formance. The principles upon which It claim*
to oserate are wholly fallacions.
The continuance of ccmnanles such as this In
operation constitutes a menace to the prosper
ity and welfa/e of the State. The operation of
such companies is nutinly had among the
poorer classes and those least able to sustain
the loss which must surely resul: from deaKns
with It. We believe it to be our solemn duty
as officers of the State to enact to the fullest
extent all powers which we possess to effect
ually stamp out these" nefarious institutions.
Accordingly we report these facts to you ami
request that you either permit us to use the
name of the State ln a summary action to en
join the further transaction of business by this
institution or that you commence such actioa
yourself as Attorney General of the State.

It will be the duty of this committee,
which will have its headquarters in the
office of the grand secretary in the Odd
Fellows building, to receive offers for
sites, ascertain their availability for the
purpose and present a report to the- next
Grand Lodge, which will meet in 1S0L
Site for Odd Fellows'. Home.
In pursuance of a resolution adopted at
the recent session of the Grand Lodge.
I. O. O. F.. Grand Master W. W. Watson
has appointed the following named as a
special committee to receive proposals for
FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES
Money to Buy Food for Inmates of
Almshouse and City
Hospital.
, Mayor Phelan, Auditor Wells and Super
visor d'Ancona. chairman of the Health
and Hospital Committee, met yesterday
morning in the Mayjor's oitice and decided
to recommend to th'e board that the sum
of $3500 be set aside for the purpose . of
food supplies for the City and County
Almshouse. This action was the result
of a report filed by Captain Reddy, su
perintendent of the Almshouse, who stat
ed that unless something were done the
Inmates In the Institution would be with
out bread by next Tuesday morning.
Reddy said that he had filed a requisition
on the contractors for flour and hay and
they had summarily refused to furnish
any more goods as long as there was any
danger of not receiving payment therefor.
The Mayor said that the matter-was one
of urgent necessity and the money will
be set aside to purchase all necessary sup
plies during the month of June.
Similar action was taken regarding the
City and County Hospital and the sum
<jf $2400 will be ' transferred from the gen
eral fund to a fund for emergency sup
plies. The inmates of â¢ both institutions
are consequently assured of being fed for
the rest of the month.
It being a certainty that there will not
be a division encampment this year, the
question with the National Guardsmen
now is what the commander in 'chief will
do In regard to' brigade or regimental
camps. If he should erect brigade camps
there will be three camps ln different sec
tions of the State. If camps for regi
ments are decided upon some point se
lected near to regimental headquarters
will be selected to cut down, as much
as possible, the cost of transportation.
General Warfleld,\ommanding the Sec
ond Brigade, has been considering the
Idea of a brigade camp. As yet nothing
has been done, but possibly some conclu
sion will be reached this week. The prin
cipal factors in this brigade, the First and
the Fifth Regiments, are not a unit on
the subject. The former is not anxious
for camp life, while the latter would not
object to a week under canvas.
Colonel W. R. Johnson, commanding
the Sixth Infantry, having been granted
leave of absence to enable him to go to
the Hawaiian Islands, Lieutenant Colonel
G. G. â¢ Grant has assumed 'command.
The Fifth Regiment of Infantry devel
oped an unusual amount of activity dur
ing the month of May, twenty-nine en
listments being noted, a number being
re-enlistments. Company F, Captain Ben
nett, has nine to its credit, Company D,
Captain Cheda. has seven, Company B,
Captain Partridge, has six. Company E.
Captain Haven, has five, and Company
H, Captain Bush, has two. This is a most
remarkable record, and- it goes to show
that renewed interest is being taken by
those who are working to recruit their
companies.
First -Lieutenant La Rue A. Deyoe. bat
talion adjutant and'acting inspector of ri
fle practice of the Fifth Infantry, has ten
dered his resignation, as he will shortly
leave the State.
IJeutenant Colonel J. G. Geisting. as
sistant adjutant general of the Second
Brigade, will go on the retired list. He
tendered his resignation to Brigadier Gen
eral Warileld and it has been accepted.
The lieutenant colonel had for some time
contemplated asking to be relieved from
the position ho had Â¦ been â¢ filling, but it
was not expected that 'he would tender
his resignation before the close of the
year. With his resignation was a request
to be placed on the retired list, he having
served nearly flf teen years ln the guard.
This has created a vacancy that a number
of ambitious National Guardsmen will be
Blad to fill. â¢ â¢ ' Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢'-. ' ' '
The commission ascplonel of the First
Regiment of Infantry has been issued to
Victor D. ; Duboce. who is still confined
to his home by illness, and he has been
sworn In. It Is reported that the colonel
may ask for a leave of absence. If he
should, however, not decide to do that,
he will ask to be placed on 'the retired
list. Then there â¢will -have to be a new
election and it is probable - that the colo
nelcy will go to the lieutenant colonel â
Anelection for major in the Fifth In
fantry will soon be ordered, vice Julliard,
term expired. There will also ; be an elec
tion ordered for. captain, first and second
lieutenant, of Company H of the Fifth
at Napa, "vice "the. present line 'officers
whose terms will expire early in July.
The champion shoot for medals will be
held at Sacramento on the 14th of July.

Robert Locke, Formerly a Chicago
Physician, Commits Suicide
With a Revolver.
SON OF A PROMINENT
RECTOR KILLS HIMSELF
Mrs. C. J. Marble Appears in Court to
Tell the Judges How It All
Happened.
FOR the third time In less than eighteen months Martin Glynn has been
arrested on complaint of his neighbor, Mrs. -C. J. Marble, on the charge
Qf disturbing the peace. The Glynn and Marble ranches adjoin each other
on the Mission road, and for years the two families have been at war and
have dragged several of their neighbors Into the controversy. Fannie Teagle.
an adherent of Mrs. Marble, was arrested some months ago on complaint of
the Glynns for threatening to shoot Mrs. Glynn and her married daughter, Mrs.
Robertson. Mrs. Teagle complained that Glynn and his family were always try
ing to kill her goats and she had to defend her pets.
Judge Mogan was the arbiter between the warring factions yesterday. Glynn
was accused by Mrs. Marble of chasing her. armed with a knife and a piece of
iron pipe, on the morning of May 25 with the object of killing her. Attorney
Archie Campbell appeared as special prosecutor and Glynn was defended by At
torney Tomsky. All the witnesses who had givÂ»n their testimony in the pre
vious cases were present and the same old story was threshed out again.
Mrs. Marble testified that between 5 and 6 o'clock on the morning of May 25
Glynn turned his flock of geese Into her corral after tearing down the fence.
She remonstrated with him and he went after her with a knife and a piece of
iron pipe, threatening to cut her up. She did not know what he Intended doing
with the iron pipe. Kvery time he saw her he would Jump at her with a knife.
She had him arrested before and after conviction she got the Judge not to
punish him, but this time she wanted no mercy shown him. He wanted to drive
her away from her home so that he could plant potatoes on her land. The Glynna
also got boys to throw rocks at her house.
"Were you ever In an insane asylum?" asked Attorney Tomsky.
Mrs. Marble nearly fainted. "Me!" she said. "Oh. my! oh. my! What do you
take me for?" She appealed to the Judge, and was so upset that she lost her
voice for a moment. When she regained her composure she called the Glynns
everything that was obnoxious, until she had to be stopped by the Judge. Tom
sky wisely forbore to cross-examine her more.
Mrs. Fnjinie Teagle saw Glynn drive his geese Into Mrs. Marble's corral and
heard Mrs'. Marble "holler." Glynn was ln the habit of running after her goats
with a club. He wanted all the land thereabouts for his geese. Nannie Teagle
her daughter, saw Glynn chasing Mrs. Marble with a knife in his hand. Mrs!
Louisa Welch, Mrs. Marble's daughter, testified to the same effect and also that
Mrs. Robertson, Glynn's daughter, was always challenging old man Marble to
fight.
Glynn gave a general denial to the charge and said that on the morning
of May 251 when the alleged disturbance took place, he was asleep In bed He
had always tried to prevent his geese going into Mrs. Marble's corral. Frank
Palasoa, a neighbor, tried to make out that Mrs. Marble's corral was leased
to him, but the Judge said. he did not believe him and shut off his testimony.
The Judge held that the charge had been proved and ordered Marble to" ap
pear for sentence to-morrow.
GLYNN'S GEESE ALMOST

ever. Have a Strong Individual
Folio-wing in Parliament.

eipht and at midnight returns have been
received from thirty-five constituencies In
dlcatir^j the election of twenty-ei/jht op
position and only seven straight support
ers of the Government. The other seats
which are still tn doubt will probably re
turn opposition members. Premier Martin
doe* not acknowledge an absolute defeat,
but claims his ability to Induce half a
doren members-elect counted among the
opposition to support his government upon
a vote of want of confidence in the House.
The straight Conservatives will have the

Whenever it *hall appear to th* governing

committee may, after investigating the facu
of the case, require the said member to dis
solve the partnership.
Suspension I? the penalty for failure to
comply with this requirement.
J. Overton Paine said that a continuous
effort to blackmail him and Injure his
credit in the street had been made by cer
tain persons for the past year.
"Notice of our dissolution," he said, "Is

NEW YORK, June 9.â The New York
Stock Exchange has taken an action
which is said to have few precedents in
its history, by- ordering the dissolution
of a brokerage firm of which one of ; its
members is a party. Under the power
conferred by the constitution of the ex
change, the governing 1 committee has
warned Paine, Schuyler & Co. that they
must dissolve partnership within the
next thirty days. The firm is composed
of Sidney S. Schuyler, who Is the board
member; J. Overton Paine and the lat
ter's brother, lacunas B. Paine. The
Paines were until a short time ago con
nected with the consolidated exchange,
where J. Overton Paine is reported to
have made a great deal of money. He re
signed a few weeks ago and with his
brother joined Mr. Schuyler in the firm
which is now about to dissolve. No spe
ciric charges have been formulated
against the firm, but the right of the ex
change to order a dissolution of a firm
and the particular significance of the or
der so far as it affecta Paine, Schuyler &
Co. is contained in a section qf the con
stitution which reads:
Member of the Ex
change. Â¦

A "CHANGE" BREAKFAST.
Getting Beady for Warn Weather.
A complete change in breakfast
would, it this time of year, improve the
health of any one.
Me:t. potatoes and coffee become
tiresome. The system calls for a change,
bet what to? Hot. and half-codVed
pastry and starchy cereah are unattrac-
tive.
Vegetables taste good but furnish too
Iitt'e nourishment to sustain one until
the next meal, particularly if brain work
is required.
A most appetizing, convenient and
healthful breakfast can be made, on
Grape-. Vuts (a ready cooked food), a
little crecm or milk; =one fruit and per-
haps two voft ejrgs.
(Pint tin cup of sharply boiling
water, put in two e^gÂ«, not one, 00"
three. cover and set off stove, serve* in
just nine minutes. Whites will be-like
cream znd hah' digested.) The Grape-
Xnts food is concentrated and bat three
cr four teaspoons should be used it one
meal; that amount furnishes full
strength and nourishment up to ths
next.
Good food in proper \-ariety and a
contented mind solves the whole health
problerx - _
A change from the old breakfast to
cr.e iik; this will refresh and invigorate
the system in a surprising manner.

/jaoORONER COLE . began yesterday
(( morning the official inquiry into the
\j? death of Emll Rosenbaum, who pol
soned himself last 'Monday after
noon at his home on Van Ness avenue.- â¢
E. F. Preston j and I. Brown appeared
at the inquest as attorneys on behalf, of
the family an-J listened attentively to the
proceedings. As had been expected, noth
ing new was elicited at the hearing, all
the evidence showing that Rosenbaum
had deliberately committed suicide. Inci
dentally the Coroner rebuked the under
taker called in. by the family for undress
ing the corpse before the arrival of the
Coroner's deputies, and Anton Kolligs,
nurse and messenger, received a repri
mand for putting into his pocket and tak
ing away from the house the pasteboard
box containing poison and the note left
by Rosenbaum in which he bade good-by
to hSs wife and announced his intention
of killing himself. These he afterward
gave to the Morgue deputies.
Dr. Martin Krotozyner was sharply
cross-exantined by the Coroner alter he
had told about having received a tele
phone call last Monday afternoon to the
effect that he was needed at once to at
tend a sick man. As the name of the
patient was not given, and as Dr. Kroto
zyner was busy in his office with other
patients, he sent Anton Kolligs to the
house to ascertain -that identity of the
patient and notify him whether the call
was an urgent one or not. Kollipcs in
formed him by telephone that Rosenbaum
was dead when he reached the house. An
hour or so later the witness went to the
Rosenbaum residence and gave as his
opinion that apoplexy had been the cause
of death. Then he telephoned to the
Coroner.,
Coroner Cole remarked that the wit
ness should not have sent a nurse to the
house in response to the first summons,
and that he should have sent some other
physician if he could not go himself..
"Especially," continued the Coroner,
"when there are eleven hundred doctors
in this city, as thick as hops and falling
over one another at the street corners.
You did wronrj, sir; you did wrong. You
should have given a doctor an opportunity
of earning a fee."
Assistant City Chemist C. L. Morgan
told the Jury that he had found prussic
acid in the stomach of the dead man in
quantity sufficient to cause fatal results.
Mrs. "Rosenbaum, the widow, informed
the jury that her husband was the Jolllest
and happiest of men until a short time
before the suicide, when he became de
spondent. He had been nagged to death,
she said, by his brother Albert, who ac
cused him of drawing too much money.
She had been shopping on Monday and
when she returned to the house she saw
her husband standing- at a window.
When she reached the parlor he was lying
on the floor unconscious. Medical aid was
summoned at oTice, but he was dead be
fore it reached him. .
The inquest will be resumed at 10 o clock
Monday morning. - -

Plan, of Organization. Adopted by the
Republicans of San Francisco.
A plan for the organization of Repub
lican clubs In the Assembly districts of

tee of the Republican County Committee.
The power to adopt a plan was delegated
to the Joint committee at a meeting of

r Four piar.s -were submitted last evening
but the proposition which was accepted
as the ba*i!= emanated from John J. tur

nlans placed before the committee last
Wednesday night. The basic plan was
smonded in several particulars, the
amendments being taken f^om a plan sub

precincts larger direction in preliminary
v-ork of organization. Following is the

CHINATOWN is becoming restless
and angry under the quarantine.
The coolies are rebelling "against
their own Chinese superiors and
against the white authorities. In
tho morning at the detention tent in
Portsmouth Square there was a demon
stration when- a- Chinaman was about to
be inoculated end at night a mob of ges
ticulating, jabbering coolies numbering at
least 1000 gathered at the headquarters
of the Six Companies on Commercial
street. In neither case, however, was
harm done, but both m&tances Illustrated
the fact that the Chinese are becoming
unruly and losing their temper.
The Chinese merchants with a better
understanding of American ways have
taken another method and more conserv
ative action to express their protest at the
quarantine. They sent a- petition yester
day to the Board of Trade and other com
mercial bodies acknowledging the receipt
of goods and begging these organizations
to investigate In fairness for themselves
and be convinced that there Is no plague
In the Chinese quarter and the quarantine
in justice should be raised.
So restless have the Chinese become and
so imperative to them has become the ne
cessity for raising the quarantine that
they do not Intend to wait until Wednes
day for the settlement of the question
In the Circuit Court. A writ of habeas
corpus was issued yf-sterday by.' United
States District Judge de Haven for one
of the imprisoned Chinese. . The writ is
returnable to-morrow and may determine
the entire question.
Gage Appoints a Sacret Commission.
Governor Gage has at last taken the
step which The Call announced several
days ago he would take. He has appoint
ed a commission of physicians and mer
chants to make a secret investigation of
affairs in Chinatown and report to him
in order that he can grant the request of
Secretary Hay for a full report of condi
tions existing In this city. In. reference to
the plague. This commission will act in
secret and \ will attempt to make a thor
ough Inquiry. The Governor was also in
consultation with United States Circuit
Judge Morrow yesterday to gain new facts
upon which to base his report. It is ex
pected that the secret commission ap
pointed by the Governor will be at; work
for several days.
Meanwhile, the quarantine continues.
The restrictions are gradually being
loosened and more people' under the pre
text of official and temporary busi
lness are being admitted. These
men are ' not required to submit
to inoculation and are permitted to
return to the places of business as they
please. The quarantine in this respect at
least places the Board of Healtti in a
most peculiar position.
"'The accusation of prominent Chinese
merchants, supported by Consul General
Ho Yow, that an offer was made to raise
the quarantine In Chinatown and lift the
embargo from Chinese goods for a brfoe
of $10,UOO,' has created a sensation. In an
interview yesterday Ho Yow said that he
was thoroughly convinced of the truth of
the charges and he has reason to believe
that he will soon be in a position to give
the name of the white man who acted as
go-between In the transaction. The Con
sul says that the Chinese who gave the
information to. the members of "the Chin
ese Merchants' Exchange and upoa whose
suggestion the merchants at -once <Â¦ sub
scribed $7000 of the $10,000, Is thoroughly
reliable and when necessary to do so he
will give the name of tho white name
who made the proposition. - Â¦/.Â¦Â¦Â¦
Ho Tow Discusses Blackmail.
"I do not know for whom this white
man was acting," said Ho Yow yesterday,
"but it is easy to surmise if it be true that
he was able to carry out his bargain.
The Board of Health of this city placed
the quarantine on the district and the
Federal officials are responsible for the
embargo upon Chinese goods. The -fact'
that this white man said -.he wanted; no
money until the quarantine had Â¦ been
raised and the embargo* had been re
moved indicates to me that he was acting
with authority. â¢ :
"All that lean vouch for.at present is
that Chinese" merchants were induced' to
express their willingness in writing, to
subscribe $!>>/>Â» for Â¦ the double purpose
which I ha^j named.' The assertlon-of
Dr. Klnyoun that $7000 was raised to pay
Dr. Plllsbury is absurd, -.without : the in
dignant denial which .-Dr.* Plllsbury^ .has
made. When . the merchants' agreed f>
subscribe the money Dr. Pillsbury had not
been engaged and there was ' no thought
of employing him. He Is paid for what he
does ana.nottln it- lump sura. "^tÂ» mer
chants Agreed to riflie the rionv/ with the
distinct-understanding that'll was to â¢bo
used for a bribe. We may have some
thing more to say when the cnÂ«e comes up
on Wednesday before the United Stated
Circuit Court. Until then we Intend to
spend more time In collecting additional
evidence.
"There is one phase of this quarantine
that I am at a loss to understand. "If the
local Board of Health and the Federal
officers really believe that the plague ex
l&ts in Chinatown why do they not Isolate
and specially quarantine the house3
which, It is claimed, were Infected? Do
they want to imprison the residents of th^
entire district and force them to contract
the plague? I can see no other inference
from their action. If the plague was/4n
the houses where it was, claimed to 'be
these houses should have been specially
quarantined to protect the thousands of
Chinese who are now prisoners within the
quarantined lines of the district. To me
the action of the authorities is very
peculiar."/
H?alth Board Demands an Inquiry.
After a secret conference lasting nearly
two hours the^ Board of Health' met yes
terday afternoon and passed a resolution
requesting the District Attorney- to call
the attention of the Grand Jury to the at
tempted blackmailing of Chinese residents
out of J10.0W on the pretext that the quar
antine would be raised. The resolution
was Introduced by Dr. . McCarthy, who
said that the matter demanded instant in
vestigation and that all parties concerned
should be brought before the Grand Jury
In order that the guilt might be fasteneji
wherever it belonged. The resolution
says: r
'â¢Whereas, In the Issues of the local
press of this day, Saturday, June 9, pub
licity has been, given to an attempt by
some person unknown to this board to
blackmail the Chinese residents of this
city out of the sum of $10,003 by' falsely
pretending that' he could raise the pend
ing quarantine for that sum of money;
and
,' "Whereas, Each- and all of such repre
sentations are wholly false and untrue to
the knowledge of such blackmailer, who
ever he may be; now therefore bÂ«L it
herebv â¢
"Resolved. That this Board of Health
forthwith call the attention of the Dis
trict Attorney to this felonious attempt,
to the end that he may have the Grand
Jury 'nvestlgate the same and discover
and punish the guilty party or parties "
A delegation of clergymen waited on the
board and made a verbal application that
Miss Martha J. Ames and Miss Florence
N. Woriey be permitted to enter the quar
antine lines for the purpose of doing mis
sionary ' work among the Chinese. The
desired permission was given, with the
understanding that the ladies are to re
main In Chinatown until such time as the
quarantine is lifted, and they are to sub
mit to all the rules and regulations im
posed by the Health Board. An excep
tion wns made in their case, however. In
the matter of inoculation, it being repre
sented that wero they yto take the pre
ventive the confidence of the Chinese
would be greatly lessened and the efforts
of the missionaries would be consequently
abridged. The delegation of clergymen
consisted of Rev.. Eugene 'H. Avery, repre
senting the Prpsbyterlans; Rev.'Dr. "W. M
Woodward; Methodists: Rev. Dr. F. l!
Wheat, rorgrorationallsts: Ttev. Dr." H
A. -Bell: UrHed Presbyterians, and Henry
A. Fiske. People's Place.
Hew Â¦ Rumors of j Corruption.
I Quickly upon' the heels of the charge
that an attempt-was made to levy black
mail upon : the -Chinese merchants to the
extent of. $10,000. comes another story of
'corruption which persistent effort -on the
part of 'those most Interested has failed
to corroborate. It is claimed that certifi
cates of inoculation' were on sale In the
Chinese nuarter and were sold at prices
ranging from $5 -to $20 apiece. Chinese
it Is said.' who old not wish to be inocu
lated could and did buy these bogus cer
tificates. The Governor, the Chines* Con
sul and ! the attorneys for the Chinese

The Chinese. Six Companies and about
200 Chinese firms have: cent a petition -to
the Board of Trade- and also, to other
commercial bodies -of-; the -city asking
their Influence to have, the quarantine of
Chinatown discontinued. \' The i petition,
which is quite long, starts with a state
ment, of : facts., concerning the institution
of the quarantine- on the 29th of May;
and this Is followed with the assertion
"we do respectfully represent and aver
that there is- not* now nnd -that there
never has I been â¢ any . case of bubonic
plague in San lFrancisco, and' that the
quarantine Inaugurated r and : maintained
by the Board of * Health is unreasonable
and -that' there is absolutely no necessity

Ten Chinamen who had been given 'per
mission to leave Chinatown, that they
might Join an expedition bound for Sibe
ria, were taken to the tent on Portsmouth
Square to have their clothes fumigated
and prepared , for : the exit beyond the
ropes. Word was passed among the Chi
nese that the men were being stripped for
the purpose of inoculating them by force,
and In less: than five minutes over 1000
Chinamen, had gathered around the tent
and were prepared to ; release the men
from the clutches of the doctors. Noth
ing- could convince the mob that the
men's . clothes r were simply being . fumi

that Sergeant Mahoney and a posse of of

torneys for ! the Chinese, declared last
night that he Intends to-morrow to ask
for the' arrest of the Health -Board on; *>*
ground that members have - Ignored
the injunction Issued by the Federal Court
and are in contempt. ; : ; r .
j In addition to this there are the aver
ments made in the other case pending that
the quarantine Is an injurious discrimina
tion against the Chinese and is therefore
In conflict with the personal rlghtsguaran
teed by the constitution of the United
States. The contention is made that there
was no bubonic plague or other epidemic
in San Francisco at the time of the adop
tion of the order and that there is none
now. It la averred that Chun Ah Sing Is
a cook employed by a Caucasian house
hold outside of the limits of the quaran
tined district and- that he visited China
town only an hour before the declaration
of quarantine; that he never had the bu
bonic plague or any other plague, hid
never been exposed to contagious or In
fectious disease, nnd that â¢ therefore "his
detention Is unnecessary and illegal.
The threatening attitude which the Chi
nese have displayed toward the Board of
Health since the plague was first said to
be In Chinatown took 'definite shape yes
terday, j Believing that ten of their coun
trymen were about to be Inoculated by
force, they 'gathered about the tent In
which the physicians and supposed'sub
jects were and prepared to mob the place.
The. appearance of Sergeant of Police Ma
honey and a number of officers prevented
any violence, but the coolies gave vent to
their rage by wrecking the store of Yong
Yet at 23 Waverly place, the proprietor of
which they accuse of having given per
mission to the Board of Health to Inject
the serum under the dark hides.
The law firm of Reddy, Campbell & Met
son applied yesterday to United States
District Judge de Haven for a writ of ha
beas corpus on behalf of Chun Ah Sing,
returnable to-morow afternoon at 2
o'clock. 'The case will determine the le
gality of the present quarantine estab
lished in Chinatown by the City Board of
Health and brings up a new point to the
effect that the order of the Board of Su
pervisors issued on >Iay 29 authorizing
the Board of Health to establish the quar

tition sets forth that the physicians em
ployed by the. Six Companies have thor

case of the plague existing therein. The
interference with the trade of the mer
chants and the general Inconvenience that
has been 'caused are made much of. The
petition also says that the matter has

OAKLAND, June 9.â The first blush
of excitement over the indictment
of County Assessor Henry P. Dal
ton has worn off, and the people
of Alameda County are now waiting to
see what move will next be made,
whether by the county or by Mr. Dalton.
In the. Superior Court next "Wednesday
Mr. Dalton will have to appear In court
and make his plea to the indictment.
In the accusation for impeachment pro
ceedings the document itself fixes the
date on which Mr. Dalt*n will have to
answer as the 19th of June, which is one
week from next Tuesday. After appear
ances have been made in each of these
cases the dates for the trials will be set,
and everything will then be pushed to an
early conclusion. Mr. Dalton announces
that he desires that an early trial shall
be had, and that he will push matters as
rapidly as possible. The Superior Court
is on its vacation, but it is not likely that
this will be allowed to interfere with the
progress of the trials.
The political complexion of the matter
rather wore off- 10-day, and It left the
facts to be sought for. -Even 'the En
quirer, which is Mr. Dalton's organ, took
back its charge against "all" of Mr. Met
calf's friends as responsible for this in
dictment, and com.ned it to "some" of
Mr. Metcalf s frlendd in the following ed
itorial: >
The Enquirer does not believe that all of
Mr. Metcalf's friends are responsible for or
sympathize with the Grand Jury's attack upon
Assessor Dalton. But that some of Mr. Met
calf's friends are responsible for It, the En
quirer has no doubt. And the Enquirer further
believes that the people of Alameda County
will not permit Mr. Ddlton to be killed oft
politically in such an underhanded way to grace
a Metcalf holiday.
Given Unusual Publicity.
The personal attacks upon the members
of the Grand Jury which found this in
dictment have forced the grand jurors to
make statements in their own defense,
and tor thl3 reason more of the proceed
ings of that body have come before the
public than is usual in such cases. Sev
eral members of that body have openly
stated that the indictment was not found
for the destruction of the field memoran
dum books, but for the destruction of ths
"office roll," which could not be produced
when they required it.
One of the causes which led to this In
vestigation of the existence of this "of
fice roll" was the fact that nearly every
member of the Grand Jury had received
notices that his personal property tax
was due and payable, and each notice
contained a statement that the personal
property assessment . was recorded in a
certain volume and on a certain page in
the County Assessor's office. When a
search was made for these books they
could not be found. The question then
to be settled was whether these books
were county records or not. District At
torney Allen says that the whole case
hinges upon whether these are county
records and the legality of the law wh'ch
makes the County Assessor responsible
for' the uncollected personal property
taxes of the county.
But the interest in the political side of
the case has gone, and it Is now only a
question of the legal action that remains
to be taken. That will begin next week,
and every move will be watched with the
greatest interest.
A mass-meeting of workingmen was
held in California Hall to-night to pro
test against the indictment of County
Assessor Henry P. Dalton. The small hall
was filled, about 300 men being present.
Authorized by No Labor Union.
The call for the meeting was by flyers,
signed "The Committee."- A. J. Read,
foreman of the Enquirer, who is also one
of Mr. Dalton's bondsmen and a very
prominent labor organizer of Oakland,
fathered the meeting and acted as chair
man. The meeting was thus made to ap
pear as an official one, backed by the la
bor organizations of Oakland. As politics
is- prohibited in labor organizations the
Building Trades Council of Alameda
County, an organization of all of the
building trades bodies, to-night issued the
following statement:
Eilitor The Call: Statements have appeared
in the dally papers? announcing that the in
dictment of Henry P. Dalton by the Grand Jury
has been received as a direct insult by or
ganized labor, and that at meetings of several
of the unions the matter has been discussed. It
may be possible that some of the members of
tho labor unions of this city have as Individual*
been discussing the indictment by the Grand
Ex-County Recorder Charles H. Spear
deplored what he called the despicable
?olitlcal methods of Dalton's opponents.
le thought.it peculiar that Assessor Dal
ton was the only county official that the
Grand Jury accused.
"Why," he said, "the expert appointed
by the Board of Supervisors should ac
cuse Dalton and no one else is strange,
but It may be stated that the expert is
the creature of the Board of Supervisors
and the votes of three of them keep him
in office. The Grand Jury is a system
that is a relic of the dark ages. It should
be abolished. It is. as it now exists, a.
political machine."
As Mr. Spear concluded Chairman Read
remarked that he had always supposed
that*justice was blind, but that in Oak
land he had found that justice , was
"green." _ '
The other speakers were Dr. George
Derrick. John Aubrey Jones, G. W. Cal
derwood. R. G. Sullivan and Herman Ben
nett. The following resolutions were
adopted:
Resolved. That Henry P. Dalton is a working
man and the friend of all honest laborers, mala
and temale.
Resolved. That Henry I*. Dalton la entitled to
and -will Bet our warmest support reeardless
of our party affiliations.
' Resolved. That so long as we respect our
manhood, our muscles and the perspiration of
our brows we will not forsake Henry P. Dalton
In his hour of need.
Resolved. That neither fake juries, mock
courts nor political reprobates Khali deter us
from giving Mr. Dalton the full measure of our
support and sympathy.
"The men who caused the Indictment of
Henry P. Dalton were contemptible
scoundrels. I can with truth say ttvat.
the indictment was for no other purpose
than to degrade him and to defeat him
in his Congressional aspirations. They say
the chairman of the Grand Jury had no
animosity against Dalton, but 1 am sur
prised at his | nerve In being part of a
jury to return such an indictment"
Hugh S. Aldrich next took the platform
in defense of Assessor Dalton. Ho de
clared that the indictment was the re
sult of a political scheme concocted by the
political enemies of the Assessor. He said
In part:
Aldrich Defends Dalton.
"Henry P. Dalton has been for six years
before the people in the office of County
Assessor, and not until he announced hla
aspirations for a seat in Congress waa
his honesty questioned. The charges that
have just been brought against him couM
have been made three years ago, but at
that time they would have served no po
litical purpose, as they are intended to
do now. This attack on Henry P. Dalton
was made not only to blast his political
ambition, but to put an honorable name
on the prison register and to belittle tho
laboring man in general. Mr. Daiton has
courted an immediate investigation. Tho
issue should be forced, and if he is guilty
of the charges made by the Grand Jury
and his guilt is established I will be one
of the first to say that Henry P. Dalton
should wear prison stripes."
The speaker reviewed the accusations
against Assessor Dalton and In defense
stated that the small books destroyed
were in the nature of private memoranda.
J. E. Holmes was the next speaker, llo
said in part:
Jury of Henry P. I>alton, but th* matter has
never been discussed In any manner at any
meeting of any substantial labor organization.
The laws of all labor unions positively forbid
the discussion of political or sectarian Ques
tions at any of the meetings. .We, as presi

in? Trades' Council, do positively stata thÂ» In

The mass-meeting was called to order
by A. J. Read, who said:
Scheme of the "Old Guard."
"We are here to protest against a
scheme concocted by certain politicians
known as the 'Old Guard' and to pro
test against the outrageous proceedings
of a body presided over by one. T. L. Bar
ker, a man who Is not qualified to sit on
a Police Court Jury.
"Another shining light of the Grand
Jury Is a man named Gray, a director In

PAKKER'S STATEMENT.
The first averages prepared showing the batting, run-getting and base-steal
ing records of all players in the California Baseball League to June 9. 1000. have
boon compiled by the official scorer of the league, J. XV. Stapleton. The following
table tells the story: ' VJV .
BATTING AVERAGES
OF LEAGUE PLAYERS
Evidence Insufficient.
Thomas Connolly and John Sullivan,
charged with robbery, got the benefit of
the doubt from Judge Cabanlss yesterday
and their cases were dismissed. They
were accused of robbing C. A. Tucker of
a gold watch at Twenty-ninth ;*id Noe
streets two weeks ago. The Judge held
that the evidence was not sufficient to
hold them for trial in a higher court.
The outcome of the Xeill-Moffatt fight
furnished food, for unlimited . discussion
yesterday. Kach man has his adherents.
Those of the Chlcagoan arc ready with
unstintftl praise for the showing he made,
while Nelll's friends' have explanations
without number.
Moir&tt'a admirers affirm that Is'eill
fought as well as he ever did, but that
his opponent's cleverness detracted from
the knowing he made; that he had never
met such a 'man before and in conse
quence his delinquencies had never been
made so apparent. Â¦â¢
This view Is not accepted by xselll a
friends. There were ugly rumors of Job
bery, but no credence was placed in them,
the worst said of Nelll being that he had
transgressed certain well-dertned -rules of
training contrary to the advice of hla
manager and others Interested In his wel
fare. .
Nelll's friends will never believe that his
showing was iii keeping with that of pre
vious tights. There was something ln
dellnable lacking, which they claim sent
him out of the ring the vanquished in
stead of the victor. Moffatt is given due
credit for the careful, workmanlike man
ner In which he went about the business
he had in hand. He was tryinsr all the
time, taking advantage of every opening.
There were times when' he seemed be
wildered at Kelll's blocking and footwork,
but he never grew discouraged.
Moffatt has decided to remain here some
time and has wired. his wife, who Is In
Chicago, to join him here. ,HIs share of
the purse on Friday night was $1600. the
loser's end being $1100. .The total receipts
were about $50tK). This amount would have
been materially increased had not the po
llen stopped the sale of gallery tickets bo
fore that portion of the building was filled
to its capacity. Moffatt will probably bo
a principal in tlie next important tight
here. Club managers arc already casting
about for a suitable opponent for him.
Tim Murphy, George Green and Phil
Green am already mentioned as posslblTi
ties. Mofrntt has offered Nelll a return
match after he (Moffatt) has . met; some
other man. â¢."â¢'. . -

5 HELL MOUND PARK was filled
with brave soldiers and pretty girls
yesterday. Canton Oakland j No.
11. Patriarchs Militant, Independ
ent Order of, Odd Fellows, picnicked on
the pretty pleasure grounds .and enjoyed
a delightful outing. The members of the
organization were dressed in their bril
liant uniforms, and the gold lace which
bestrewed each one's coat outshone the
orb of day. The members of Canton No.
5 of this city were the honored guests of
their brothers across the bay. Their uni
forms equaled their hosts' in splendor, and
when a bunch of the Patriarchs Militant
got together .the whole vicinity was
lighted up. They drilled, danced, ' ran
races and pulled on a rope in such a
youthful fashion that a spectator was
puzzled to learn where they gained their
title of "patriarchs."
The games were Inaugurated after
luncheon, and for nearly two hours the
crowd watched some exciting sport. The
race between Captain Kornbeck and
Captain Cole was highly amusing. Both
strolled over the course In animated con
verratlon, unmindful of the shouts of the
spectators. Captain Kornbeck was
awarded a handsome tin sword for talk
ing the fastest. At the conclusion of the
games the local company grave an exhi
bition drill In the pavilion. Captain. Korn
beck put his command through a series
of difficult maneuvers amid the applause
of the spectators. At the close of the
drill Captain Cole presented JÂ»im with a
cake as an appropriate offering to*such
a brilliant command. The success of the
outing was due to the efforts of the fol
lowing committees:

San Francisco 5, Oakland 2.
New faces and old were seen at Recrea
tion Park yesterday afternoon. Oakland
played Borchers In the box and Midget
Mangerino back of the bat; San Francisco
the great Reitz at short. To put the foam
on A. L. Reach sat in the press box des
canting of the days that are passed and
the future that will t- |Ii Reach is an
authority on the pame, Â«. well as a maker
of balls. He comes from the Kast and
knows a thing or two about all the old
timers. What he says about the local
gamr was much to Hank's liking and
made Theodore P. Bonnet Bay happy
things to himself. Hank was happy for
another season. His team la now in third
place.
Sad and heavy on the bench sat Uncle
Hank In the seventh. Up to that time
he had the Dudes Jn all kinds of crema
tories, but then fitzpatrick did Btunta
that provoked bad words from the local
fans. In quick Succession Hutchinson,
Hardie and Krancks went to the bags on
hits and the bases were crowded. This Is
where Kitz went particularly bad, but In
the other way, forcing In Hutchinson and
Hardie by walking Moskiman and Dun
leavy. Uncle Hank was so passionate at
all this that as soon as he regained speech
lie put Iburg- in the box and no further
run-getting resulted. But the score did
not remain two all for any length of time.
In the same inning Keilly was presented
with two bases by some eccentric throw
ing of Uorchers to first and scored on a
repetition of the act.
With two men sleeping In the cemetery,
Frisco pushed its first man over the rub
ber in the third lnnlngr. Hlldebrand
played safe at Tlrst by a hit toward Dun
leavy's grounds with which Brockhoff col-
Ikied on his attempt to make second and
was called out. Then Mangerino made
his fim strong arm mistake by throwing
a few thousand feet too high.- while Hilde
lirand skated toward second. Mr. Hllde
brand scored while the bunch tried to lo
cate the ball in the center field.
In the fif tli Borchera was on his bad
behavior and was found for three hits,
one of which was a double by the non
s^wattinp Fireman. Rube Levy Â¦was safe
at the first Back on a hit to center and
Kitz's two-baprger sent him to third. Then
Rrockhoff rolled the ball out and Levy
covered the pkH<?- That was the extent
of the run-srettlnsr.
In the tifrhth liorchers was found again ;
and Home fulsome errors gave Hank's i
tenm a few runs. Hlldebrand and Sulli
van passed the rubber. The score:

To a lair start Prince Pepper went out
to make the running, with The Puritan
and Bella Rio Ills nearest attendants. At
the furlong Prince Charles moved up into
fourth place and Honnibert, too, looked
dangerous. Prince Pepper led into the

t?ned out Prince Charles challenged and
in a hard drive a!l through the last six
teenth won by a head from Prince Pepper.

THREE CLASSIC
EVENTS RUN AT
GRAVESEND TRACK
Violated Ordinance Prohibiting Car
rying of Banners on Public
;U ; Streets.
For some time past a boycott has been in
force against the Golden Gate Cloak and
Suit House at 1230 Market street, and
members of the union have emphasized
their antipathy toward the firm by parad
ing in front of the store with- huge ban
ners, asking the public to withhold its
patronage from the house. A number of
wagons with painted transparencies were
also used by the boycotters to advertise
their grievances, and were driven in front
of the place. - '_â¢Â¦'"'Â¦; '.
Charles Wise of the firm declared that
the action of the strikers was contrary to
law and yesterday swore to complaints
against twelve of the men. charging them
with .violating an ordinance recently
passed -which makes it unlawful to carry
advertising banners on the public street
or sidewalk. Seven of the warrants were
served, and Isldor Jacoby, Sol Smalovich
J. Goodman, Charles Schwartzberg Israel
Wasterbuk. Ben Lubback and M. Knorph
were arrested and charged with misde
meanor. -
Sterl & Knowles' Diminutive
! Greyhound Is Picked
to Win.
> Â¦ Â¦
Strong Hares Make the First Bound
of the Reserve Event an Inter
esting Oneâ Champions
Course To-Day.
0 ' y r -â¢:â¢
Sterl & Knowles' For Glory, one of the
smallest greyhounds coursing in this
State, has been made a favorite for the re
serve stake to be decided to-day at Union
Park. This diminutive miss was runner
up to Royal Flush last week, and as she
will not be called upon to meet any dog
of her class her admirers expect to see
her get the flag in the deciding course this
afternoon. In the long-odds book the betÂ«
ting is 4 to 1 against For Glory; 5 to 1.
Candelaria and Anchor, from the Curtis
kennels; 6 to 1, Little Sister and The
Grafter, and 10 to 1 against Belle Clair,
Sara, Patriot, Random Aim and Old Glory.
The trials yesterday proved unusually
Interesting, owing to the strong hares.
These took the dogs in many courses
across the field. Favorites were uniformly
successful, there being but three upsets
during the morning and only two during
the afternoon. In the first course of the
day Diablo was installed a 2 to 1 favorite
over Eleven Spot and was beaten point
less. Leah beat Lawrence at 4 to 1. The
latter led, but the hare proving a strong
one Leah outworked him. Tic Tac beat
May Hempstead at 4 to 1. Just Tipped
beat the imported dog My Selection at 4
to 1. .The English dog has gone out of
condition and will not be started again
for some time. Wanda beat Lady Emma
at 4 to 1 after a short "no course. In
tlfls Lady Emma was unsighted for a
time, and the test of the dogs waa not
sufficient to satisfy Judge Grace.
Keunnex itytl The Jester ran two min
utes and twenty-two seconds, the longest
course ofythe day.
The class stake to be decided entirely
to-day promises exciting coursing. The
dogs will run: Risky Attempt vs. Hot
Haste. Metallic vs. Kid McCoy, Flying
Fox vs. Brutus, McKinley vs. Herschel's
Pride, Whitehead vs. Master Clair, Mar
clssus vs. Royal Flush and Vulcan vs. Sir
Pasha. The dogs are equally matched
and the ultimate winner will be hard to
pick.

STRIKING BOYCOTTERS
THROWN INTO JAIL
FOR GLORY IS A
STAKE FAVORITE
AT UNION PARK
A good lot of hares which had been
drilled to the location of the escapes
helped to makÂ« - yesterday's programme
at Ingleside Coursing Park an interest
ing one. Bohe created a mild sensation
In her course with Hawker. The dog3
were slipped to a fast hare that made a
straight run for the escapes. Bohe got
in a great dash of speed, scooped the
hare on the run, making as pretty a pick
up as was ever seen on a Held. The
course lasted but ten seconds.
Miss Wilson on the short end at 1 to 2
won a clever race from Hummer. makingr
the kill just at the escapes. Hummer
made his reappearance after a long lay
off and seemed out of form.
Glen Klder, a recent Eastern Importa
tion, got the flag from Good Bye after
running a good undecided and, though the
score was a close one, the winner proved
himself the better dog and won on merit.
He was a gctod Â«.hort end at 1 to 8. Hadi
wist won a good race from Sweet Music
and gave the talent who quoted 3 to 1
against his chances a setback. The
spectators enjoyed the course., which was
run directly In front of the grand stand.
Lady Garnett beat St. Elmo at 1 to 4 in
the longest course of the day, whicb. she
won on staying qualities. In a no go be
fore the run the Lady was unsighted and
St Elmo killed before she could Join In.
Terrona beat St. Helen at 1 to 4. He
led all the way in a long straight run up
In the center of the field. The hare was
not turned until reaching the fence. Ter
rona took the turn and made a brilliant
kill
The talent played heavily on the Tod
Sloane-Shootover race, but got in wrong.
Tod won by clever work.
Bohe is in good position and with Green
hall. Golden Rule. Morning Glory, Daisy
Claire and Mamie Pleasant stands a
chance for the final. Palraflower la a con
sistent performer, but had hard work yes
terday. J V *

CHARLES SYDNEY O'BRIEN, the
gentleman of dusky complexion
who gained a world-wide reputa
tion as the composer of "Mah An
geline," Is heard of once moreâ this time
at the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where
he was taken Friday night by Policeman
J. H. Pearl of the California-street sta
tion, raving and seriously 111. Since he
ceased to sing the notes of his popular
"coon" song O'Brien has been almost tor
gotten, and even the last issue of the
directory fails to give his name and ad
dress. From entertaining fashionable
audiences with the 'strains of his melody
he has drifted into obscure parts, and for
gotten by the world has nightly picked a
banjo In the resorts and dance halls on
the .Barbary Coast.
At midnight Friday night Officer R. S.
Skain- found O'Brien lying on the side
walk at the corner of Pacific and Kearny
streets. The man was delirious and un
able to even give his name. "He was reg
istered at the California-street police sta
tion for medical treatment and hastened
to the Harbor Hospital, where the doctors
pronounced his condition dangerous. La
ter he was taken to a lodging house.
The litigation between O'Brien, who
claimed that he composed "Mah An
geline,'* and Bert Williams, whose song
"Dora Deane" was almost the exact coun
terpart of 'the former, except in name,
ended In Judge Morrow's court on June 1,
1S9S. The decision. Which practically de
clared that O'Brien had been guilty of
stealing the song of which he swore he
was the composer, marked the beginning
of his dimming as a theatrical star. The
series of lawsuits lasted many years, ex
tending back to the time of the Midwin
ter Fair, and Involved the names of many
prominent people.

Dr. E. X. Torello spoke with much fer
vency on the necessity of securing the
passage of the ordinance extending the
Pound limits to the county line. He
showed conclusively that as it now stands
property cannot be improved with any
guarantee of safety while cattle are per
mitted to roam at will through people's
gardens and back yards, tearing down
fenans and destroying vegetation. A larpe
delegation of men and women will pre
sent themselves before the Suprvisors to
morrow, when the final vote will be taken
on the ordinance.

Magician Cancels Engage
ment to Appear at Chi

5"l TR AGICIAN KELLAR. who will be
//y/\ at the Columbia Theater next
II 1th Â» week, will not appear before a
Chinese audlfnce, as he had an
ticipated, upon his arrival in San Fran
cisco. When last In this city the wizard
was very popular with the Chinese de
votees of the black art and frequently a
number of the long-tailed Celestials would
find themselves In the front rows of the
theater gaping In wonder and admiration
at the adeptness of the magician.
An enterprising local Chinese theatri
cal manager who was also taken with
the skill of Kellar sent him a contract to
perform at his theater after the show at
the Columbia one night during the week.
The offer was accepted. But manager and
magician reckoned without their Phelonic
host.
The plagueâ the plague's the thing that
will prevent all such novel performances
and now the contract has been canceled.
The Chinese manager wired Kellar his
regrets and Kellar replied that owing to
the existing circumstances the deal would
be called off.

Tie lope lound my cushin's washe houses,

lips of a half-crazed Chinese fresh from
a delirious pipe drtam, is what spread
the "newboiiic" plaj?uÂ» In the neighbor
hood of Irving M. Scott Grammar School,
near the Iron Works, last Friday after
roon. Miss Anr.ie Manning, a tiny, lisp
ing little woman of tender years, asserts
that the ChlndM had the "newbonic"
plague. It is certain that If he didn't
he was !n a fait way of catching it, or
something: e!s?.
Little Miss Manning failed to tell the
story, however, in all its harrowing de
tails. Early In the afternoon when Misses
Murphy. Morgan. Nunan and Crov.i were
preparing their classes for the closing ex
rrcises the Chinese arrived on the scene
and forthwith usurped the star position
on the programme. He arrived hatless
and senseless. In his right hand he car
ried 2. bucket of blood; in his left a cup
of crimson hue. After making his in
troductory statement he proceeded to oc
ocupy Miss Crowl's headquarters. She
evacuated without resistance and laid her
defenses in the hall closet. "John ' wash
ed down a bag of oranges with a few
quaffs of gore and then moved on Miss
Murphy's stronghold. Miss Murphy fled
precipitately. Misses Nunan and Morgan,
when they learned of the attack Issued
a call for volunteers. All of sufficient age
to hurl a brick with accuracy were press
ed Into service.
When "John" Issued from the rear door
a youngster, with hair that matched the
fragment of brick he carried, found the
range and the day wasrwon. They took
the Chinese homo in the rear of a brother
washman's "hack," the commencement
exorcises were abbreviated and the vic
torious army went forth to enjoy the com
ing days of rest.
That night the janltress said 'twas a
shame that "chllder" should flght on the
closing days of school and spatter their
fresh young blood over desk and floor.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. June 9.
The teachers of the Oakland School De
partment have been officially notified by
the Board of Education that it will cost
them 1 1-3 per cent of their yearly salaries
to realize cash on their monthly warrants.
While not a new situation In the admin
istration of city government, this is the
first time that-the condition has been pre
sented forcibly to the department in the
shape of official communication.
The board attaches the blame for this
condition of affairs to the State laws gov
erning the collection of taxes. Here Is
the excerpt from the Finance Commit
tee's report adopted at last night's meet-
Ing of the Board of Education:
"It must be borne In mind that all the
above salaries are subject to a discount
of at least 1 1-3 per cent before they can
be realized In coin, because of the pecu
liarity In the State law for the collection
of taxes, which renders the treasury
empty a great portion of the time. Nine
or ten monthly warrants of each year
must be sold at a discount before money
can be realized on them." â¢
The report, which Is signed by Directors
Giles H. Gray. C. H. Redington and W.
F. B. W'akefif-ld. is upon the fixing of sal
aries of teachers and janitors for the next
fiscal year. Even at the minimum dis
count of 1 1-3 per cent, this means a con
tribution of $13 30 a year from each
teacher and Janitor on each $1000 of sal
ary to the warrant shavers. At this rate
the total annual premium forced from
teachers alone on the basis of the 1S99-1900
salary roll will reach $3200. This is ex
clusive of discounts on salaries of all
other employes of the School Department.
The board has raised from $1200 to $1300
a year the salaries of the following prin
cipals: Mrs. Harriet Mullen. Harrison
School: I. D. Martin. Piedmont School;
Miss Elizabeth Powell. Grant School.
This was done because these principals
are obliged to teach two divisions in ad
dition to their general supervision of the
schools.
The increase In salaries of the Central
School teachers places that school on a
high school basis. The roll will be in
creased J5000 a year. All teachers hand
ling high school subjects at the school
are raised from $300 to $500 a year. S. P.
Meads of the Oakland High School has
had his salary raised from $1723 to J1900 a
year.

AJLAMEDA. June 3.â Fire Chief Krauth
performed en act of great bravery this
morning at a fire in the residence of Mrs.
Anne J. Nahl. 1601 Central avenue. But
icr his heroic rescue in a moment of dan
ger F. R. Newman, a member of Sherman
hose company, would have met a horrible
fate la the flames.
Arr.cr.g the studding: and timbers sur
rounding tie kitchen chimney the fire
played merrily. Chief Krauth led the way
Into the fiery room, followed by Assistant
Engineer Al Cumbers and Newman. Ho
directed them to run a scaling ladder Into
the jLtttc, pull the hose from thÂ© steamer
up with them and fight the flames from
above. ThÂ« firemen prepared to carry out
the orders and were soon half way up
the 6len<ler ladder with the hose. Some
tin authorized person came along at that
moment and attempted to mount the- lad
der. Under the- weight of the three men
and the big- hose the ladder broke, pre
cipitating: everything human and inani
mate into a heap. Cumbers and the un
known scrambled out of harm's way.
Newman was pitched forward Into a spot
where the smoke and flames were thick
est. His dangerous plight was recognized
at once by Chief Krauth. Without eati
matir^ the danger the intrepid Chief
plunged after the prostrate fcrm of New
man, who had been partially Etunned by
the fall. Pickirie up the fireman he car
ried him to a. place of safety, where the
fresh air brought him back to conscious
nesss. Later he was sent to his home on
Sherman street in an express wagon. It
will be several days before Newman will
be. able to return to his employment, as
he Is suffering: from several slight burns
and a wr^nche-d. elbow.
Chief Krauth pooh-poohed the gallant
rescue to-day, preferring; that the matter
should only b* considered an incident In
his danperous calling- There was consid
erable talk about the Incident and Fire
man Newman was chief among the ap
p'auclers.
The fire in the Nahl residence is sup
posed to have been caused by mice which
chewed on the ends of parlor raaicb.es
Jyingr in a vacant closet. It was discovered
by Arthur Nahl. who had been up until
a* late hour attending his Invalid mother.
Young Nahl, assisted by others, conveyed
her to the house of a relative before turn
ing: In the alarm. She was not apprised
(Â¦f the tire on account of her precarious
condition, resulting from heart trouble.
The damage done is estimated at $15,000,
principally agrain?t the house and fixtures.
The famous Nahl collection of paintings
by old masters, valued at $50,000. was en
dancered and some damage by water was
<inn^ to a few of the most highly prized
pictures of Arthur and Charles Nahl. two
artists of note. In tho hurry and excite
ment to pet the p.ilntlnps of the old mas
ters out of the house they suffered more
or less from chippinpr. There was but
S4'X"0 Insurance on the house and pictures.
Th^ Nahl collection includes paintings
of great value by Rubens. Rembrandt.
Raphael and a number of other masters.
In 1889 Arthur Nahl broupht back from
Jjrr-fiden this collection, which, as pole
furvivine heir of a family of not^d artists
find sculptors. h<Â» inherited. The most
valuable ones were sent to New York a
few years apo and Fold. The remainder
were stored in the basement of the Xahl
home.

Decides on Handsome Improvement
for California - Street
Property.
The Mercantile Trust Company has de
cided to erect a large building on the
north side of California street on the lots
recently purchased by It and which extend
from the eastern line of the Hay ward
property, on the northeast corner of Cali
fornia and Montgomery streets, upon
which an 11-story building is about to be
constructed, to the property of the Lon
don and San Francisco Bank, on the
northwest corner of California and Leldes
dorff streets. This Information is derived
from a gentleman prominently connected
with the Mercantile Trust Company.
While nothing was made public concern
ing the intentions of the company when
the deeds for the California-street prop
erty were recently placed on record, it is
now said that the purchase was for the
purpose of putting up a new building and
not to simply derive revenue from the
three-story structures now standing there.
Very likfly the new building will be a 10
story affair. Such a structure Is consid
ered favorably by some of the directors.
If that plan Is adopted the appearance of
that part of California street will be so
much changed in the next two years or
less that the older residents of San Fran
cisco will have difficulty in recognizing It.
MERCANTILE TRUST TO
PUT UP FINE BUILDING

for these Â¦ operations vary according to
the actual expenses. When copper is
added for alloy a charge of 2 cents per

added. The depositor receives In gold
coin the full value of the gold in his
bullion, less such charges as are indicated
above.
The mints may lawfully refuse to re
ceive gold bullion of less value than one
hundred dollars, or when it is too base
for coinage; but in practice deposits . of
gold bullion are accepted without regard
to amounts, and rejected only when too
base for coinage.

middle of the eleventh century, who were
called Vallombrosians, from the name of
the site, or gray monks, from the color
of their habits, which, however, were aft
erward changed to black. Theye were the
first to admit lay brethren. The monastery
became very wealthy through donations,
and the magnificent buildings were erect
ed in 1637. It formed a refuge for priests
during French rule In Italy. After 1S15
the monks remained in possession, but in
diminished numbers. In 1863 the monas
tery was suppressed and the buildings
were made use of for a royal academy of
forestry. The place is very picturesque
and is still much visited by artists and
tourists. Â¦ Â¦ ':Â¦Â¦ iÂ« - :"

After a number of years of faithful ser
vice in the oflice of grand secretary, dur
ing which she has made a host of warm
friends in the order. Mrs. Georgie Cotter
Ryan has decided to lay down the cares
of that office and not be a candidate for
re-election. Her reasons for this Is the
increased labor in the onice and conse
quent worry has affected her health,
which during the past year has not been
of the best, and she feels that she is in
need of rest. There are many in the order
who will feel deep regret at the step that
she has decided upon.
Miss Lily O. Richllng. a native of Jack
son, Amador County, founder of Ursula,

nized organizer of the order which has

The party that was given last week by

affair, which was conducted under the di
rection of the 1900 committee, of which
Mrs. A. Aigeltinger is chairman. It was
an apron and necktie party, which was
attended by a large number of ladies and
gentlemen, who enjoyed a well-arranged
programme of dances.
The new parlor. El Vespero, instituted
last Monday night at South San Fran
cisco by Mrs. Agnes^Lunstedt, one of the
enthusiastic and proficient district deputy
grand presidents in this city, gives prom
ise of being one of the most active fra
ternal organizations In that section of the
city. It is composed of many bright young
ladles. The introduction of this parlor
into the order was witnessed by a lar^e
number of past grand officers and many
members of the local parlors.
Knights of Loyal Guard.
The institution last week of a division
of the Knights of the Loyal Guard, of
which a local notice has already appeared
in The Call, adds one more fraternal or
ganization to those of this city. At the
institution Dr. B. Coggshall. the deputy
supreme commander in chief and Western
manager, stated that those who started
this association in Michigan did so after
a very careful survey of all the mistakes
made by other organizations and' had
built fo as to avoid them in the man
agement of Its affairs. It is expected that
under the captainship of Thomas K.
Kase. the presiding officer, together with
his assistants, a membership of yfty or
more will be enrolled at the next meet
ing.

establish a division there.

'court of the order, the first in the city.
At the next meeting it is expected that
the organization will be completed.
Last Thursday night there was a meet
ing of the Past Chief Rangers' Associa
tion. Several names were added to the
roll and it appeared that more than half
of the local chief rangers who are ellgib.e
have already joined. Owing to the vaca
tion season it was decided to skip the
next regular meeting, so the next meeting
will be held on the second Thursday- in
August. The association decided to keep
the charter open until the'Tneetingr In Oc
"oronhyatekha, the supreme chief ranger,
sailed from Melbourne some time ago for
the English jurisdiction via Paris. He was
expected to reach that city during the
latter part of this month. After visiting

Nra.> York Stock Market.
XEW YORK. June. 9.â Those who expected
that the bears who sold stocks short in large
volume during the final dealings yesterday
Â¦would scamper to cover their shorts to-day
and work a sharp rally to close the week
were disappointed. The depressed condition of
foreign stock markets continued to-day tn spite
of the rather more assuring opinions for a
peaceful outcome to affairs In China, so far
as the 'Interests of European powers are con
cerned. Selling for London account was on a
liberal scale here. Rumors are disseminated
to the effect that this foreign selling Is really
for account of some large New York operators
at present In London and who hare long been
prominent on the bear side of the market.
The fact Is that yesterday's sudden weakness
of stocks Is not understood as to Its motive
or Us course and current rumors represent the
surmises of those groping for light more than
any authentic knowledge. Wall street, in
reality, is rather skeptical about r*-i>orts of
crop failure at this stage. Neither Is iluÂ» for
eign selling in sufficient volume to account for
the weakness. The news of the day. while
inclining toward deprestAon. Is of about the |
same character as for some time [>a*t. while
the maiket has been sluggishly Indifferent.
Speculators are, therefore, inclined to fear that
some unfavorable factor not yet known to the
public Is Inducing liquidation. The money
market outlook, beyond the Immediate future.
is not altogether satisfactory. The week's ad
ditional loan exi>anslon of $6.4S3,000 must clear
ly be attributed to renewed foreign demand
j upon our credits. Estimates of the future
I ease of the local money market have been
j predicted upon a cessation of this foreign de
mand.. The acuteness of the stress for funus
in Berlin seem to be the cause of new Ue
niand. If this loan extension to foreign bor
rowers should continue Into the perl^l when
New York banks are called upon to finance
the crop movement, now not far distant, n
rapid dissolution of the surplus which was re- |
duced to $1S.374,2CO would necessarily result.
Yet this additional call for $5,000,000 Of Gov- j
eminent deposits will lÂ«e followed by tlir^r- j
other rails for the same amount, thus tak:ng
up the whole of the }2fÂ».00o.CKÂ¥i metlMrji la
redeem the Government 2s. which are ealltM
for August H. It Is opttonal with the bank!"
when they shall be presented for redemption.
Until they are redeemed the calling of Gov
ernment deposits from the banks will continue
to act as a drain of the money market. The
market closed steady on a covering movement
by room short*. Prices of stocks are con
siderably lower for the week and 'the specu
lative mood continues depressed and despond
ent over the uncertainties in the outlook and
the fear of decreased profits In business and
resulting, drain In values. It Is to be con
sidered that If th!Â« fear was backed by con
viction there would be liquidation In force
and excessive speculation en the bear side.
On the contrary, liquidation has been restricted
to Inappreciable drlbbllngs for the most part
and the prevailing mood Is one of apathy' and
Indifference. The changes for the week have
been accomplished on a very small business.
Trading on the Stock Exchange has approached
the point of absolute stagnation. Holders seem
content to hold for the present, hoping for
better things even with no present demand
for their stocks. The incidents this week have
been on the side of depression and the natural
reaction from last week's fictitious rise ha*
moved In the same direction. The covering of
short contracts, which was the real cause of
that riÂ»\ left the market technically wenker.
The reduction of the short Interest withdrew
a prop from the market and the taking of
long lines on the advance brought pressure to
take profits In Its train. These causes ac
centuated the dominant Influences, which were
the acute stage developed In the complications
in CWna and the growing fears of a failure
of the spring wheat crop in this country. The
market has Â«hown ltsÂ«lf sympathetic to foreign
stock markets throughout. This Is more'
especially due to the fact that some support
for American securities was looked for with
relief attending the fall of Pretoria and the
security of the Johannesburg gold mines. The
new development In China has effectually
counteracted this expected Influence and the
expectations of easier money conditions abroad
have also been disappointing. The Bank of
England, by refraining again from . reducing
its minimum discount rate, proclaimed to the
financial world that It proposed to conserve
Its resources for some future contingency.
The Berlin boursÂ» has been In a 'condition of
panic through the forced sale of Iron shares
to pay off loan obligations. American securi
ties have received no support In foreign mar
ket* and the selling for forPlgn ' account In
New York, though small, has l**en an effective
element of depression. The demoralization In
foreign Iron markets has been due to the
course of pries In this country, which prom
ises effective competition for foreign Iron man
ufacturers in their own markets. The cut in
Iron prices announced here ,Jiad little direct
effect on securities, as It has been discounted
nnd Is but a step toward attracting buying to
meet the well-known consumptive require
ment*. No one rxpects buying orders will b*
placed to meet these requirements until It la
demonstrated that the recession In prices has
been ended. For this reason a plan has found
advocates In the iron trade of a sharp! gen
eral rut In prices to well below the price of
production In order to effectually consume pro
duction and work oft accumulation. The eon-
Bequencen involved of throwing out of business
weaker concerns, the reduced employment for
labor and a corresponding train of circum
stances are not viewed with equanimity In
Wall rtreet. even while the desirability of a
stable basis of prices In the Iron market Is
fully recognized. The Importance as a basis
of prosperity of stocks Is being brought sharp
ly Into prominence by the critical conditions
existing In the spring wheat belt. Pessimist*
have already given up the Northwest whÂ»at
crop aÂ« a failure .and point to the necessary
results In reduced buying power by thf de
cline In railroad earnings and bo on through
the complicated channels of trade. These
lamentable prediction* have not had great
effect eÂ« railroad earnings are well maintained
and the generally conservative course which
has been pursued by the railroads of making
necessary outlays during the period of pros
perity with a view to preparing the way to
retrenchments In a possible period of adver
nity * afford a buttress to confidence In the
stocks of these properties. The falling off tn
traffic of the railroads and the disputes arlcln*
It various points over competitive, freight and
pasÂ«enger rates bare nevertheless weighed on
the "rail road list. The placing of Atchlton pre
ferred on a dividend basis and the maintenance
of the quarterly, dividend on Sugar at the lVj
", f Â»t rate only temporarily strengthened
those stock*. The extensive reductions In the
PoÂ»rÂ«UnfÂ«WÂ«nÂ»Â« of the ; Atehlson system for
thÂ» benefit of net earnings lessen the effect
of the Increased dividend. Wnlle the Amerl-

The pernicious practice of contracting for
Buiter on newspaper quotations may. like a
good many other evils, correct Itself. It has
extended to the retailers, who find that by con
tracting on the same basis as the wholesalers
they can pave 1 cent a pound on their pur
chases. In other words, they can go over the
heads of the wholesalers and buy their Butter
direct from the country. Anything that will
break up this practice is a blessing to the trade.

decrease Is traceable to the amounts paid In to
the treasury In response to the call of the Sec
retary for a percentage of public deposits, but
these payments were counterbalanced In large
part by receipts .of funds from the Interior.
Following the expansion noted a week ago of
about seven and a third millions In loans, the
fame item for the current week shows another
gain of JS.5S3,C00, although In what channels
these new commitments have gone it Is not
easy to explain. The loan total is now J13.000.000
in excess of the highest record of 1899. Deposits
for the week are $5,790,900 higher, owing to In
crease In Joans, but the total does not come up
to the maximum of $914,000,000 reached during
the early part of the year 1899. The general
trade and speculative situation does not sus
tain the theory that the rising totals Is. both
loans and deposits are caused by demands from
either source, and It is probably true that spe
cial operations are responsible for the heavy
changes. The approaching July dividend pe
riod now less than three weeks distant, will
begin to influence the weekly statement from
this time on. In view of this circumstance and
also because of the payments of the banks to
the treasury, and the early cessation of a flow
of Interior funds to New York, it Is to be ex
pected that the reports of the banks will goon
show declipjng averages.
Whether higher money rates are to be looked
for Is a problem that Is not capable of solution
just now. Taking Into consideration all that
hnÂ« been outlined, and the additional ract that
a Presidential campaign and heavy crop move
ments'are drawing near, in*, natural Inference
Is that with the maintenance of a volume of
business anywhere near the present level money
must advance if It moves at all. The new cir
culation taken out by banks will not be an ap
preciable factor In stopping ordinary movements
of money over the present crop year, although
It may chanee to a slight extent the character
of the money sent West. The circulation taken
out by one New York bank alone amounts to
dnte to more than six millions.

only a part of the competitors are Inside the

The time is beginning to arrive when It 13
possible to rate the wells of the Kern River
fields. Heretofore thÂ» capacity of well haa
been largely guesswork, the estimates having
been affected by th? owner's enthusiasm or
his conservatism. Through the courtesy of D.
W. Carmlchael. secretary of the Sacramento
Company, whose land Is In 23. 28. 23. the heart
of the district, the Californlan Is able to give
the record of well No. 1 for the month of
May. These figures were taken from the books:
Number of barrels sold. 1HS: consumed as fuel.
150: remaining la tanks. 120: total. 1416. Tho
well was Idle five days because of a short
ness of water, making twenty-six days of
actual pumping. The average dally output
was. therefore. 54.50. In this connection it
should be stated that this well haa never been
sand pumped or cleaned out, and that the
pump Is only within 220 feet of the bottom of
the hole. As soon as the press of other work ia
overcome, the well will be put' In good condi
tion and the hope 1st entertained that the pro
duction will go 100 at least.

â¢Profess* Watts of the State Mining
Bureau, In a recent article upon the busi
ness risks that are. run by the oil pros
pector, -Â¦ made some statements . which
might be profitably- read by the novice.
Professor Watts describes all oil prospect
ing. enterprises Into two classes, as fol
lows: ,
A new organization known as the Cali
fornia Crude Oil Company has secured 7S0
acres in the Santa Paula district nnd also
some property in the city of Los An
geles. '
During the past week much has been
heard or oil in San Francisco. It has been
discovered at various points along the
California coast, which is a matter of
common knowledge. Probably this fact
led certain persons to think that it was
not unlikely that oil sands underlay San
Francisco. Many of the pieces of prop
erty near the beach which were offered
for sale have been withdrawn. The mys
terious whisper is buzzed about that seep
ages of oil have been discovered south of
Golden Gate Park and well out toward the
ocean beach. Lands have been bonded
for sale at prices higher than those at
which the tracts have previously been
held. There does not appear to be much
excitement in this direction yet, whatever
there might be should actual tests deter
mine that there is oil below the beach
lands In quantities sufficient and of qual
ity high enough to pay for mining.
The probability. is that if there Is petro
leum wealth under the clty.it is not con- 1
fined to any particular place. Such is the
teaching: of experience in all oil fields so
far explored in California. The very con
siderable extent of the oil belt in Los
Angeles has already been pointed out. Tn
the Kern River field the territory in which
oil has recently been . produced is milt-s

the world. Paul Dvorkovitz, editor of the
Petroleum Review of London, is promot
ing the congress as much as possible, and
in a letter expresses the hope that Cali
fornia will be represented, and that no
tice shall be sent as early as possible con
cerning the appointment of a delegate or
delegates. Possibly this will be consid
ered by the newly organized California
Petroleum Miners' Association, one of the
leading purposes of which is to make
known abroad ..the petroleum wealth of
the State. There are many Callfornians
who will be in Paris in August, and a
delegate may be easily secured.
At the first executive meeting of the
directors of the California Petroleum
Miners' Association one of the matters
discussed was the organization of the
petroleum miners of San Francisco.
There are several hundred companies in
the bay counties, with oil lands In vari
ous localities. It was agreed that .San
Francisco should have its own county
organization and to send delegates to the
State convention. The directors were of
the opinion that dealers in all supplies
for the oil industry would rind it to their
interest to belong to the State associa
tion. The Dally Oil News, published in
Los Angeles, has this fling at the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners' Association:
Just what degree of success will be met
with by the California Petroleum Miners'
Association of course no one can yet
state. Thus far it is, in its membership,
a local affair for San Francisco, though
an effort is being made to give it a State
representation. It would seem that Los
Angeles is the natural home of such an
organization if there is any need for its
existence', as most of the oil men look on
this city as their home. If there is any
disposition in Los Angeles among oil men
to enter the organization the fact is not
yet in evidence."
A new oil field has been discovered in
the Palomas district, Castiac Canyon, near
Newhall. Certain experts have been ex
ploring and have reported favorably con
cerning that locality. The formation con
sists of sandstone, brown shale, blue shale
and sand strata, large deposits of gypsum
being interspersed In the shale. The new
section- lies north of the Pico wells. The
Palomas Mining and Oil, Development

California copper mines seem certain to
derive benefit from the fire in the Calumet
and Hecla. with the consequent stopping
of work. Of course it is too soon to meas
ure the {fleets of that' lire, but If this
mine fails for months to turn out its great
volume of ore the market must feel the
shortage. The Mines and Metallurgical
Journal, after a careful review, says:
It is true that the great coppr mines are
making enormous profits, from 200 to 300 per
cent in many oases, and it is likewise true that
this cxtraordlnary return upon the capital In
vpsted is Ftlir>ulat!nj; production throughout

fact remains that consumption is growing even

ail the copper likely to be mined for many
months to come will be unequal to the world
wide demand for ft.
This was written before the Calumet
and Hecla fire.
The copper production of Shasta County
|ast yean at prices then ruling, amounted
A committee has been over the proposed
route for a short line stage and wagon
road from Redding. Shasta County, to
Copper City. The Redding Free Press re
ports that a feasible direct route was
found from the Sacramento to the Pit
River, in a northeasterly course, starting
near the mouth CT Sulphur Creek and
reaching Pit River at the terminus of the
Black Diamond road recently built. "For
four-fifths of the route from the Sacra
mento River," says the Free Press, "to
*., , m o ut h of Bear Mountain Pass the
Almighty has made a grade as level as
the best roads in the county, and all that
man need do is to out his way throughithe
brush, throw up the soil to the middle of
the road to turn the rain Â¦water."
Some account of the exorbitant rail
chargf-s on shipments of ore in Inyo
County, to which allusion has been made
in these columns, is given in recent cor
respondence of the Los Angeles Mining
Review as follows:
On a valuation of $23 pfr ton. freight charges
J6 per ton; more than $2.i and less than $50 per
ton. $S per ton; more than t~>0 and less than
Jino t,er ton. *H> por ton. It Is Ftated that the
< arson and Colwrado Katlroad, although having
the name of charginc "all the traffic will
bear, had precisely the same scale of charges
but deemed it advisable to close Its eyes to
the valuation part of it. and were in most
cases content to ship all ore at the $6 rate
tÂ» Sar. Francisco. When Mr. Huntingdon ac
quired Utle to the Carson and Colorado road
the aeent* received instructions to insist on
the valuation portion of the contract, and the
value was to be determined by the emelter
returns, less the amount of working charges.
In the event that the value of the ore had not
l>Â«>n previously <>tfrmined a valuation of $100
per ton was to be tacked on to It. the railroad
kindly consenting to reimhurse the shipper if
the ore should not work that amount.
The Banker. Merchant and Manufac
turer, published in Chicago, has this re
markable statement: "The fruit products
of thr- State (California) are valued at
$7,000,000 a year, while the gold production
is a million dollars less." That publica
tion should straighten out its facts. The
gold production of California amounted
lapt year to $lo,."?36,031 and the total min
eral production of the State was J23 313 -
46(1.
The three dredgers for use at the Pot
holes on the Colorado River, in Arizona,
will be floated on scows 30x110 feet in
size. A mining publication says:
Earth will be taken from the river bed by
mear.s of a continuous chain of buckets that
will work at the extreme depth of thirty-six
fe*-t below the surface of the water. Kach
bucket, with a weight of over 1000 pounds, has
i capacity of four cubic feet, giving each
'iredyr a capacity of- 4000 cubic yards a day.
The engines are to be eighty horsepower. The
travel carried up will lie dumped Into a re
volving cylindrical grizzly, four feet in diame
ter and fifteen feet long, which will sort the
material into various rizes. The finer gravel,
containing gold, will be run off into sluice
boxes. Each dredsro will require the services of
fifteen men and will consunv 210 cords of wood
per month. Each dredge will cost 150.000.
â¢ W. H. Storms, assistant State Exami
ner of Mines, in an article in the Mining
Prefs makes the following generally in
teresting statement: â¢
An Impression has prevailed that the mines
of the central gold belt,, or mother lode, pos
sessed such pronounced characteristics as to
pive them a certain similarity. Such, however,
is not the case. It is quite true that in cer
tain contiguous localities the mines do bear
a certain resemblance to each other, but in
the various counties they are as unlike as
could be Imagined. Some of thoso of Marlposa
and Tuolumne bear a certain resemblance to
each oth^r. and these to some extent are not
unlike those near, Placerville, in El Dorado
County. The mines of Amador, however, lor
the mart part differ very materially from those
ahovÂ» referred to. while most of the mines of
Calavoras an? unlike either. It would only be
T<osrlble to ret a definite Idea of these mines
and their chancing characteristics by an In
timate description of the mines themselves.
The Mining Press says:
The old town of Cherokee will, ere long
assume an aspect of activity. The Spring Vai
ley hydraulic mine, which was closed down
through Injunction proceedings several years
ago. will, through permit from Â¦ the Debris
Commission, resume operations. Ground has
been broken for a restraining dam In Dry
Creek, -everal miles below the diggings. There
U here an ideal dam site. By means of a bar
rier 16 feet high and 1720 feet long the tail-
Ingg from the mine can be ' spread over an
Immense area, of the company's own land. The
dam will be constructed of brush and tailings
now on the ground. It will be 80 to 100 feet
wide at the baee, narrowing to 16 feet on top
A spillway 80 feet wide will be cut through a
solid lava bank at the side of the dam. The
Denclson Contracting Company of San Fran
cisco will construct the dam for the new
Spring Valley Company, which Is composed of
Httfburg, Pa., business mon. the leading
stockholder being A. \V. Mellon of the bank
ing firm of Mellon & Son*. The company owns
an excellent water system, purchased with tho
mine, the water belnsr diverted Irom streams
at elevations of MOO 6nd 3400 feet above Â»ea
level. There will he a fall at the hydraulic
monitors of 250 feet. That portion of the olrl
dlfrrinca known as the Sugar Loaf will be
hydraullcked. The gravel stratum under Table
Mountain will be worked by the drift process
The restalnlng dam should be completed, ac
cording to contract, the fore part of Augunt.
The Jackson, Lakeview and May Lundy
mines in Mono County have, according to
the Bridgeport Chronicle-Union, passed
into the hands of a Colorado Company.
The old superintendent. R. T. Pierce, has
been retained. The contract has been let
for poles for an electric line, the new com
pany intending to work the mines by elec
tric power. The cyanide plant has begun
work.
F Hutchlns and-Wl A. Newctim are de
veloping a copper proposition at Ranlett.
Scene From "The Girl From Chili,"
FRAKK BACON and Gus Tate open in the latest Xew York farce comedy
success, "The Girl From Chill," Sunday afternoon at the Grand Opera
house. Mr. Bacon, who plays the character of Homer Doomsby has to
escape the persecutions of Juanlta. the girl from Chili; he disguises him
self as Willie Bczoozoo. King of the Pata^onians, in which attire he encounters
Fredericksburg. the family butler, who is terrified at the apparition.
"The Girl From Chili" is one of the most successful farce comedies of the
year. It is rich in humorous complications and bristling with bright and witty
dialopnje. To quote the language of a well-known Eastern critic "there is not a
pintle bald rpot in it." It furnishes two hours and a haif of genuine and healthy
mirth, ajid will be the means of introducing in the name part Edna EllÂ«;mere a
pretty San Francisco girl, who during her absence in the East has greatly dis
tinguished Tiersclf. Â¦ .
