sooner the cleansing.^process is done the
better it will lie for San Francisco. The
whole world has its eyeson that section
of San Franciscd, and when the city has
been- placed in a sanitary;, condition : it
will free itself from the cloud of danger
that hangs over it. As far 'as I can .see
the duty of the San Francisco Health au
thorities is plain. It matters not. .what
money it may cost nor. what labor may
be involved, the Board of Health of San
Francisco has upon its shoulders a sol
emn duty which it niust perform. The ex
citement created by the plague has called
to the attention of the authorities the out
rageous unhealthy condition at China-
town. Neither the people of San Francis
co nor the : authorities who represent
them can : afford . to - wait. - \ Chinatown j is
known -throughout the world as one of
the filthiest quarters in existence in a civ
ilized city, and San Francisco will not be
relieved from the suspicion of other cities
and " States until ;. it has" removed this
plaÂ«ue" spot: . â¢ , â¢ : â¢ . . ;
â¢"In consideration of the fact that the
people 'of .the- United â¢ States have ex
pressed _great Â¦ uneasiness atthe situation
in' San.Franclsco.-I.want-to. declare posi
tively that there is not, the remotest dan
ger of contagion i in* San Francisco if the

things that ; plague does not. exist in San
Francfsco thaÂ£ I would not hesitate- to
spend- the summer in this city with, my
family if it were necessary so to do. be
lieving thus that I would run no special
danger and with the knowledge that I
would be absolutely free from contagion.
This I consider â¢ a strong argument in.
favor of the correctness, of my position.'.

jeopardize his personal interests by asso

THE Chinese should consider that this movement is for their; good; that the- white man is
a friend to the Oriental, in spite of what is said to the contrary. I am convinced that the
citizens of San Francisco are doing what they canto cleanse the Chinese quarter/and
that the inhabitants of that quarter will appreciate their efforts. I do not anticipate
any trouble in that quarter. I am of the opinion that the Chinese will cooperate with the
citizens, and that all this talk of riot is moonshine.; 1 1 found during my investigation that the
Six Companies are perfectly willing to work with the authorities. There will be no trouble in
Chinatown if the local-Board of Health takes reasonable measures allowing the Chinese to
attend iq their business/and assuring them that, if everything goes well, they will be in a bet
tercondition than heretofore. Some one of influence with the Chinese should persuade them
that no harm is intended to them. We all know that the Chinese .are suspicious,. and every
effort should be made on the part of those in authority to relieve this suspicion.

Mayor Phelan followed in a few re

favor of giving Chinatown a forced
cleaÂ»sing and said that the Health Board
had "been working under disadvantages
and had had insults heaped upon it ga
lore, but had under 1 the circumstances
made an excellent showing.
Chairman Watkins then called on Dr
Shrady. who spoke to the: point on the
situation. He said: "You are going about
It in the right way and I am glad to see
the merchants stand by the local Health
Board. The cleansing of Chinatown is th j
main feature of the situation, and when
you get it clean you should make Its deni

case and disinfect every inch of the area.

. Subscriptions were then offered. Some
members entered their names but named
no amounts, promising to do so to-day.
A committee of ten will be appointed
this morning to take charge of the fund
and to get further subscriptions. ThÂ«
sum of $28,350 was realized at the meeting
and it Is likely that the needed amount
will be forthcoming to-day judging from
the easy manner In which the merchants
donated.

"A detention camp Is an immediate ne

would be acceptable, and Mission Rock

"The sugar warehouses would be the
best place In this emergency, and efforts
are being made now to secure the prem
ises if needed."
Dr. Williamson was called on again to
answer what he thought would be the
proper steps In the present situation. He
replied that the board was financially un
able to cope with it. The board had
started on the one object of ridding the
district of filth and putting It in a proper
sanitary condition. The flushing of the
sewers is an Important Issue, though not
without obstacles, many of the side sew
ers having blind extremities. He said:
"We have taken cognizance of the dan
ger of the spreading of disease by rats
and have killed many of them by means
of poisoned fish. The fish are split open,
filled with a poisonous oil and placed in
the sewers on long planks. The flsh have
disappeared, and consequently many rat3
have been destroyed, but it is a small
percentage of what must be done.
"The exits of the district must be closed
and we need more help to moke the ouar
antlne effectual. . ... r
every inhabitant of the area should bÂ»
taken and an Inspection be had every day.
Where a disposition to evade any sanitary
order is shown proper punishment should
be dealt out. Where a new or suspicious
case develops It should be isolated until
It could be determined. Every insQector
and worker in the district should be Inoc
ulated, and every article in the houses
should be thoroughly disinfected or de
stroyed. Keep as few in the district as
possible and offer inducements to get
them from their unsanitary condition to
a condition of cleanliness. We should
have a place of detention, where usupi
clous cases could be held for the regula
tion fifteen days. The destruction of rats
i9 an important factor in this crusade.
Rats and mice are the chief conveyors of
disease, as has been shown in every place
where an epidemic has prevailed. Fleas,
too, are carriers of germs, and it has been
shown that disease has been spread by
those insects after biting an afflicted per
son.
Business Men Advocate the Cleansing
of Chinatown and Subscribe Read
ily for That Purpose.
THE merchants of this city have de
cided that, plague or no plague,
something must be done to offset the
effects of the widespread publica
tions circulated throughout the country
that San Francisco is a victim of an epi
demic. Much as some of them believe that
the bubonic plague does not or never did
exist in our midst, still they realize that
prompt and vigorous, action . Is the only
available weapon with which to combat
the . conditions which, nave" Cone so- much
harm to the tfade of San Francisco.. . Â¦Â¦.
In order to show their Eastern brethren
that"' they will not' allow their interests to
suffer through lack of energy, the busi
ness men of- this city "have set about to
rectify the existing conditions in a manner
that will no doubt satisfy the most exact-
Ing.' ' "â¢â¢ â¢ Â¦ ' . Â¦ : '
A number of merchants and business
men attended a conference at the rooms
of the Board of Trade yesterday morning
and discussed the situation. The one idea
of the meeting was to devise some means
for the raising of the embargo which has
been placed against the city to the great
detriment of its trade and business.. The
session lasted about an hour, and the sug
gestion was made that it be made more
public and general.
Acting on the suggestion, the business
part of the town was gone over and mer
chants were asked to meet at the Board of
Trade rooms at 3 o'clock. . The call was
well responded to, and at the time set
nearly, every downtown business house
was represented 1 at the meeting.
A. -A. Watkins of the San Francisco
Board of Trade called the meeting'to or
der, and began his address to the business
men by saying: "We have met this after
noon for the purpose of taking action in
the matter of the plague which Is sup
posed to be in this city. Now, we of San
Francisco know that there is no danger
of the dread Asiatic disease becoming
epidemic here, but the question Is bow
shall we convince our sister States and
the entire nation that there Is no danger.
The damage done to our commerce and to
the community in general cannot be esti
mated, but it caji be augmented if the
quarantined territory Is enlarged, and,
gentlemen, it is time for us to act. This
morning a gentleman asked of Federal
Officer Dr. Kinyourt if he had at his dis
posal a large sum of money for the quar
antining ot the city. Dr. Klnyoun said
that he' had $100,000 at his disposal to bot
tle up this city if San Francisco does not
come to the tront in a manner befitting
a wealthy community.
"Dr. Williamson, president of our local
Board of Health, is here, and a few re
marks from him would not be inappropri
ate." â¢
Dr. Williamson addressed the meeting,
and explained that owing to a lack of
funds the health authorities were handi
capped. "Gentlemen," he said, "there is
but one thing for us to do, and that Is
thoroughly to cleanse Chinatown, and to
do it thoroughly will entail a great deal
ot expense, but it will not De mono
wasted. As a member of the board, I
suggest that you, gentlemen, merchants
of this city, will handle the funds, ap
point your committees and take entire
charge of all money. Then there can be
no cry raised that any of It has been
m " & $e P are 'willing to devote our time and
labor if you will contribute to the cleans
ing and disinfecting of our ttlthy China-
J C Stubbs, third vice president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, addressed the
meeting at length. He said: 'it is not
now a question of the existence of the
<nlague; there are sixty millions of people
who believe that It is here and we must
change their opinions, and there is but
one way to do it and that one way is to
clean out Chinatown and clean it in such
a way that there will not be a doubt as
to Its sanitary condition. We should
make a house to house canvass, disinfect
cverv inch within the area, flush the sew
ers, and where filth exists destroy it one
way or another. " â¢
"There is nothing that can weigh
against such a policy; sho"w the people
of the country that if the disease is in
that ill th spot we will take care of It and
not let it go out. The local Board of
Health is fhort of funds, and we. for our
own* interests, should back it up. No fire,
earthquake, flood or any other calamity
has had that ill effect on this community
that these reports have made on our
business. No matter what the cost may
be we will rind that it will be the best
investment we have ever made. We must
have the hearty co-opcratlon of the Chi
nese Six Companies in the premises and
have thein understand that the measures
taken are as necessary to them as they
are to us."
Dr Kinycun was introduced, and after
giving a resume of his work for the
United States Government at the request
of several" of his audience he gave his
ideas of what should be done in tr-.e mat
ter cf cleaning Chinatown. .
"Bv all means." he said, "we -must rid
tho-Chlaesre quarter of its n th and do so
at once. The area should be -'.pflned and a
strict compliance with all sa-iltary orders
should be rigidly enforced. ,A house to
house disinfection is â¢Â« necessity c and
should be resorted to daily until satisfac
tory- Â¦ results arc at hand. A census ot

."Having concluded my mission. I shall
return to New York on Sunday, and In
conclusion I wish to say that while I am
assured that the plague has been in San
Francisco I am also thoroughly convinced
that It was nothing more than a sporadic
instance, and that any measure of quar
antine which may be taken by outside
cities Is unjust and unwarranted. The
authorities of San Francisco have no
present fear of infection, and I agree with
them thoroughly In their position. What
ever they have done and whatever they
are doing is done simply for the purpose
of removing a plague spot which has long
disgraced the city."
Â¦ v.v * . Â¦
"In passing I feel called upon again to
refer to the^Xew York Board of Health.
If the officers of that board were here and
the policy which they have adopted were
followed I am firmly convinced that a
very few days' activity would remove the
slightest shadow of doubt in reference to
the situation in this city. As I have said,
the duty of the authorities here is plain.
They must leave nothing undone to con
vince every community In America that
not only is the bubonic plague not in San
Francisco, but. that the health authorities
of the city have reached the conclusion
that they must remove at once, and by
any measure^ which is found necessary,
the only menace to their health which
exists In their midst.
In <51scussins the alleged plague situa
tion In San Francisco last night Dr.
Shradv declared that he found nothing to
warrant a further investigation of the af
fair. He said that he had come here ab
solutely a free agent to Investigate and
report his impression. He says that he
is convinced that the bubonic plague has
existed in San Francisco, but only in spo
radic instances, which Involved no danger
to the people of the city and warranted
00 quarantine against them. He Congrat
ulates the authorities of the city for their
efforts in sec-kins to cleanse Chinatown
at a time when the plague threatened to
make its appearance In epidemic form.
His concluding words before he returns
to N< w York arc given in the following
interview: , -
"Alter having visited every section or
Chinatown under the escort of the police
and of the health authorities, both Fed
eral and Jueal." said the physician, "I

DR. SHRADY FINISHES
HIS INVESTIGATION
Chinatown is still under quarantine
and will remain so until there is not
the slightest suspicion of danper. The
Chinese are accepting their imprison
men gracefully. The clamor which has
been raised by them for food still con
tinues, although there is at present no
indication lhat the local authorities will
have to make" any appropriation for
provisions for. the people in the district.
On evfry hand there is a congratula
tion rather thaiv disappointment over
the excitement which has called forth
the energetic measures of the authori
ties. Within a few days San Francisco
can announce not only to the other
cities of the world that it is free from
any plague, bat that it ss in a perfect
sanitary condition.
THÂ£ .â¢exciternciit in this city occa
:sioTic4. by: .the â¢ discovery 1 of a
sporadic case of bubonic plague
Has endc& Local. State and Federal of
ficials arc firmly convinced that there is
not the slightest occasion for alarm.: a^.d
that the precautions now being taken in
the Chinese quarter are more than
ample to prevent a reappearance of the
dread disease. E?r. George F. Shrady,
the famons specialist who came to this
city at the instance of. the New -York
Heraid and of The Call, declares that
he has completed his mission, and with
a complete understanding of the facts
and a thorough knowledge of the situ
ation he wishes to assure the people of
San Francisco that they arc not in tbe
. slightest danger of contagion, and that
tather than feel aggrieved at the de
velopments which have occurred
they should congratulate themselves.
that the agitation over the bubonic
piagxsc has resulted in a determined and
conscientious erTort to remove from the
city its great plague spot in Chinatown.
Of. Shrady says thai he came here
with the thought thst bubonic plague
existed in this city,' He says he; is grati
fied to announce .that it is not here and
that anr quarantine which may be in
stituted by other, cities or States is ab-
unwarranted. There is no more
danger, he declares, of contagion in tlm
city than in any pther city in the Amep
ican Union, in: an interview with the
eminent physician yesterday he declared
that* the measures now being taken to
cleanse the -..Chinese district are emi
nently in the right direction and should
be pursued until Chinatown is placed in
Â«oa ab*ok;iery sanitary rendition.- Pre
caution," he says, and not prevention, is.
tlie order of the day.
At a rreeting of the State Board -oi
Trade held yesterday merchants, rail
road men and phy5-icians ; discussed the
situation at length, \ They were unani
dOTXS in their opinion that while every
health authority in the local. State and
Federal service' had declared the plague
does not exist in San Francisco, everyr
thing should be done to cleanse the Chi
nese district and convince the world
that San Francrsco is thoroughly on its
guaTd and intends to remove the filth
menace which has' been for so many
years a disgrace to the city. In carry
ing out this plan the merchants sub
scribed over, S28.000, which will be ex
pended in carrying out the reforms of
the local Board of Health in Chinatown.
This sum of money was freely contrib
uted yesterday, and is but the beginning
of a "fund that will be devoted exclu
sively to the accomplishment of the re
form outlined for the Chinese district
to- see every, case presented if it was one
or one thousand. : I failed to see a single
case of live plague and saw only one in a
corpse. From this standpoint it would
peem that the rumor that plague threat
ens San Francisco Is ridiculous and un
founded. One swallow does "not make a
summer, and one' case of plague does not
make an epidemic. It is my impression
that plague is virtually stamped out, es
pecially in view of the action of the health
authorities in keeping it where it was and
in view of the determination of the Bourd
of Health to fight it on rational, scientific
lines. Merchants are giving their strictest
attention to the question and have con
tributed no end . of money to make this
practicable. . I aril more than pleased to
see the manner in which the citizens have
taken hold of the situation, and this will
ct- rtainly have a good effect on the rest of
the county. If the citizens will continue
to keep. this matter in hand by appropria r
tions and proper support the danger to
the city will be lessened.
"The Chinese should consider that this
movement is for their good; that the
wnlte man Is a friend of the Oriental In
spite of what is said to the contrary. I
am convinced that the citizens of San
Francisco are doing: what they can to
cleanse the Chinese quarter, and that the
Inhabitants of that quarter will appre
ciate their efforts. I do not anticipate
any trouble in that quarter. I am of
the opinion that the Chinese will co-op
erate with the citizens and that all this
talk of riot Is moonshine. I found during
my investigation that the Six Companies
are perfectly willing to " work with the
authorities. There will be no trouble in
Chinatown If the local Board of Health
takes reasonable measures, allowing the
Chinese to attend to their business and
assuring them that If everything goes
well they will be In a better .condition
than heretofore. ' Some one of influence

action is "contained In the following reso
lution, which was unanimously adopted
natown during the quarantine. It was es

require assistance, at the rate of 25 cents
each per day. Dunne stated that there
was no section of the charter which au
thorized the board to make expenditures
tor the food supply. This view was not
contested by the various counsel present.
Thry thereupon prepared the following
communication to the Board of Supervis
ors, requesting It to take steps to meet
the emerpenry:
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of San Francisco:
The Board of Health has established a strict
quarantine fif the district bounded by Califor
nia street. Keainy street, Montgomery a\enue,
Broadway ftreet and Stockton street. ajid has
thereby confined within the quarantined fils
trict more than 10.000 persons, most of : whom
are- laborers depending lor their dally food upon
their daily wages. Nearly all of these, people
are, by the. quarantine, cut off from every

at- least one-hklf. of them are already reduced
to a condition of distress borderlnir cn : famine
for lack of iiecessary food. On their behalf and

probable that the number of indigent persons

LOUISVILLE. June 1.â The tenth : an
nual . reunion' of the United Confederate
Veterans adjourned sine die at 6 o'clock
to-night. The meeting of 1901 will be held
in Memphis. The annual parade of the
veterans was abandoned, on account of the
inclement weather. "â¢'Â¦â¢ .' â¢' â¢
., The morning session ended in a state of
great excitement and : confusion. The
trouble arose at the conclusion of the pre
sentation of the report of the committee
on resolutions. A resolution had been in
corporated in the report to the effect that
the convention of Confederates recognized
with appreciation the language of Gen
eral Daniel E. Sickles, the orator at the
annual reunion orthe Army of the Poto
mac at Frederickshurg, in which General
Sickles had. mentioned most kindly the
men of the Confederacy, and the resolu
tjon" said the Confederates reciprocated
the feeling: shown toward them by the
men of the Army of the Potomac. '
General Gordon put the question of the
adoption elf. the -report. There was a
chorus of -''ayes," and when he called for
the vote in the negative he said: "The
ws have it." After he had announced
the vote there came a few cries of "no."
General Gordon said:: '
Â¦"I did not think .'that there would be
any negative votes !ori such a question,
but as there were some after I had de
clared the vote I will now rcsubmit ft."
. The author of the resolution, W. H. Bur
gynn, made a strong plea for its adoption,
lie said that he hnd .been present at the
meeting at Fredericltsburg and had heard
the kindly sentiments expressed by the
soldiers of the North, and he desired the
passage of the resolution merely as a mat
ter of courtesy. Â¦:' . . â¢ : -
Colonel J. H. She'phard ; of Richmond,
Va., secured the floor and said: ;
-."I want no coquetting- with the Yan
kees- who defeated iis. For God's sake,
don't accept anything from their hands.
Don't accept anything from Union sol
diers. Vote it do*n, comrades! Vote it
down!" ' Â¦ ; : :. :: -.= Â¦â¢"'. '..
. Instantly there was-- a terrific uproar.
Dozens of delegates? were on their feet de
manding recognition from the chair. Gen
eral Gordon -.finally restored order, and in
response to a call for his opinion said:
"I trust the time will never come, while
I. stand on Southern ground or among the
chivalrous men of tho South, when I will
refuse to send a kindly: message to an en-

TUCSON, : June 1.â The rival factions of
the Gbbre Grande Copper Company are
keepihg up ; an Incessant fight. Having
exhausted ail kinds of civil remedies, they
have: turned their; hand to making crim
inal:; charges against each other. Presi
dent "V7. C. Greene yesterddy swore out a
warrant against Con O'ICeefe, one of the
prominent members of the opposing fac
tion, charginghim with burglary in enter
ing his, Greene's, office in; -his absence. '.
Last -week a prominent officer and mem
ber of. -the company was arrested on the
charge of perjury. The fight over the
possession of this famously rich copper
property has been very bitter. The courts
of Mexico and Arizona have been bur
dened with litigation over it. Things have
gone so far at times the Mexican Gov
ernment has had to place troops on the
property in order to keep the rival fac
tionsfrom using force. -.. .: .
the department, that ht> believes excellent
results would be' obtained from, cavalry,
and that horses now readily subsist on the.
country and the supplies which the cav
alry carries with It in campaigns. Before
finally taking action. Secretary Root said
this afternoon, he will, consult with Gen
erar Otis and Brigadier General Schwan,
both of whom will: come to Washington,
the. former after visiting Rochester. â¢:
Â¦ The department ha$ contemplated for
weeks the dispatching of cavalry to Ma
nila and has been considering what addi
tional regiments to send. It was suggest-,
ed to ' the Secretary this afternoon that'
there was cavalry, in: Cuba, but the Sec
retary replied that he could not say
whether any of the force there could be
withdrawn until after the Cuban elections
on June 16. It will be necessary to send
additional reprtments to the Philippines
to take the place of volunteers who ' will

braska^; Kansas and Iowa. The provisions aggregated 4000 tons. No official
â¢.acknowledgment; had. ever been received of that :. donation Â¦â¢ so far as ho Was

"She has'. spent" tens ,;and -hundreds pf millions of- -dollars. In. striking^ down and crush

What has he '.in the way. of Information upon this -point? "What Information has he
as to. England's action in this matter while she is spending hundreds of millions Jn
destroyliig tlie. Boer republics?
Aldrjch interjected. some caustic remarks abput making pro-Boef and po

; MANILA,' June: 1.â Captain Roberts of
the Thirty-fifth .-'Regiment and . his two
missing companions, captured at San
Miguel de Mayumo, province of Bulucan,
island of Luzon, May 29, are still in the
hands of the rebels, who have communi
cated to the: Americans their intention to
treat the prisoners well and in accordance
with the laws of war.
During last night Captain Roberts' wife,
who was at San Miguel de Mayumo, re
ceived a note 1 announcing the capture of
her husband. The good treatment of the
prisoners continued and Captain Roberts
believes the rebels will exchange him. and
hta companions,'
The first report of the capture of Cap
tain Roberts and his companions was
erroneous. The captain with six scouts
was surprised while lunching. Three of
the party were killed and four captured,
one of whom was wounded. The wounded
man was. liberated.
Captain Abbott of the Forty-second
Regiment recently met 250 Ladrones near
Sinalion. One American was killed and
the Filipinos had eight men killed and
four wounded.

quartermaster general, said that this work
had been accomplished with very small
loss. There are two animal .transports
now in the Philippines which will return
to San Francisco in July, and one trans

animals; is now at San Francisco. It is
expected, that to transport the cavalry to

gramme has been prepared, the
principal events being a four-oared barge
race .between a crew made up of "W. t).
Patch. E. Kragr.ess. George -Baker and
Alex W. Pape, and ;i four manned by W.
A. Donovan, R. Ohe.i, 11. A. Swedlumi
and T. R.-Dixon. The first-named crew
is composed cf senior oarsmen, while their
opponents recently rowed in the junior
barge race on Olympic ladies' day at Bel
vedere. On that occasion the juniors
fouled the Alamedas at the turning point
and finished last. There will also be the
regular barge race's between the Irish and
German members of tht club, walking th-j
greasy pole, a handicap swimming race,
in which A. \V. Pape will be hanracapper
and scratch man, a:Td an outrigger skirt
race for novices. The contestants in this
will be E. Kragness, H. A. Swedlund, K.
Ohea and W. A. Donovan. Dr. F. K.
Axton and W. O. Patch will pull in a
senior race in outrigger skiffs, and it is
possible that a trophy may be offered for
a match race in outrigger skiffs between
George Baker and Stanley Adderley.
At the Belvedere regatta George Baker
won an easy victory over STtanley Adder
ley, but the latter thinks he lost a good
deal by poor steering, due to his unfa
miliarity with the course. He feels cer
tain that he can make a much closer race
over water that he knows and on a
straightaway course. Since the new
Fishermen's wharf is being constructed at
North Beach the course will be from the
foot of Van Ness avenue to the foot of
Taylor street inside the piles. It will bÂ«
about one mile with a, turn. The commit
tee in charge of the events consists of TV.
O. Patch (chairman). J. S. Earls. W. L.
Bush, T. R. Dixon and T. J. Kennedy.
The nominating committee of the Dol
phins has named the following to serve
as officers of the club for the ensuing
half-year: For president, F. W. Woern
ner; vice president. K. H. Coney; record
ing secretary. W. L. Bush; financial sec
retary, F. C. Staib; treasurer, A. L.
Schuppert; sergeant at arms. Lester Ham

going except C. M. Farrell are at present
holding the offices for which they hava
been nominated. C. M. Farrell some years
ago served five consecutive terms as cap
tain and proved himself a good worker
and efficient officer.
The Ariel and Pioneer Rowing Cluba will
give a regatta at Long wharf on the 10th
inst., at which there will be barge and
outrigger skiff races and the second com
petition for the Alpers medal. The South

Alex Vogelsang, president of the Fish
CommiFSion', received a beautiful specimen
recently! pf the Lake Superior trout, com
monly.known as the Mackinaw. It was
taken J-n Lake Tahoe. near McKinneys,
and weighed four pounds.-. The Fish Com
missioners-have-been planting these fish in
Tahoe for several years. A. number of
small specimens were taken last year, but
this. is the largest seen by the Commis
sioners. The Mackinaw grows to a big
size in.- Lake. Superior. . '.some weighing
twenty pounds often reaching the Chicago
markets. There is no reason why the fish
should not. do -well in Tahoe. If they at
tain in Tahoe the size of the trout in Lake
Superior they, will. tax the strength of the
tackle in- common use there. Fly fisher
men do " riot : regard ; the Mackinaw with
favor, as. he' is not known to come to the
surface: As., the- Tahoe fishing is chiefly
done by trolling the Mackinaw should
prove a great favorite- .- . '.. '. .

ADVlliiTISKIWF.NTS.BROOKS STREET CLOSED
BY HIGH BOARD FENCE
Habeas Corpus "Writs T>enied.
The Supreme Court has refused the ap
plication of Joseph Teshara for a writ of
habeas corpus. Teshara was arrested for
killing Garrett D. Loucks in Santa Crua
County, held by a Justice of the Peace for
murder, and committed to the custody of
the Sheriff without bail. His attorney in
applying for the writ made the conten
tion that there was no evidence to'con
nect the accused with the killing of
Loucks. and submitted all of the testi
mony taken at the prelimlnaray examina
tion. A writ was also denied In the ha
beas corpus case of James D. Prather of
Sacramento, who was committed for per
jury in falsely testifying as to the deliv
ery of a lot of grain to his brother.
plans had been made. We Invite an in
junction restraining us from blockading
the alley, so that 'the matter may be
brought into the courts at once."
The bunding proposed by Moore will ibe
erected on Market, Grant avenue and
Geary streets, and will contain one of the
finest theaters In the world. An arcade
covered by glass will extend through the
property, and may cover the site of
Brooks street.
There' was another reason for the clos
ing of the alley talked of on the. street
last evening, and one involving the appli
cation of the new "side entrance" ordi
nance. It was suggested that If the street
should be closed and become private nroD
erty there would be a quesUon in recard
to the rights of the police to close any en
trance, r 'slde" or otherwise, that opened
on to It. The ordinance does not deal so
much with entrances as it does with
places, however, and it is not believed
that the character of the property uoon
which the entrance opens will serve to
evade the law. Besides, the question of
side entrances is not one involving a legal
question so much as a license. The Police
Commissioners under the ordinance have
power to Issue or refuse or revoke a
license independent of the character of the
property upon which any of the entrances
pf the saloon may open. J\ is asserted
however, that the point may be raised In
the cases of those side entrances that or>en

Block Where Alley Has Been Blocks dsd.
BROOKS street, which has served
for years as a passageA-ay for pe
destrians between Geary and Mar-
ket streets, through the triangular
shaped block formerly known as the
Blytne block, extending down to Kearny
street, was closed to the public yesterday
afternootK. A high board fence was con
structed near the Geary-street entrance
to the alleyway, and watchmen were sta
tioned on the premises to prevent Us de
struction.
The obstruction was erected under In
structions , from A. A, Moore, tho attor
ney for Mrs. Florence Blythe-Moore, who
owns most of the property on the block,
Including- Brooks street. The attorney
maintains that the alley Is private prop
erty, and as Mrs. Blythe-Moore expects
to Improve the property In the near fu
ture, she wishes to settle all disputes that
may arise amicably before any plans are
laid. On the fence Is posted a decree of
court entered and filed March 31, 1SS2, In a
suit brought against the Blythe estate,
declaring that the strip of land was
owned by the estate, ana not by the pub
lic. It has since been blockaded by posts,
and maintained by the estate for the use.
of tenants occupying adjacent bulldlngrs.
The objection to the obstruction will
probably be raised by the Sawyer estate,
owning a twenty-foot frontage on Geary
street, not adjacent to the alley, but with
a rear connection to it. Attorney Moore
maintains that at the time Blythe deed
ed this property to Sawyer Brooks street
was ten feet wider than It Is to-da.y, and
that the rear connection Involved was but
twenty feet In length. In order to Becurb
an exit on the alley, after the latter had
been reduced In width. Sawyer extended
his prant ten feet, which the Blythe es
tate now claims he had no right to do.
"The object In erecting this fence," said
Attorney Moore, "Is not for the purpose
of Infringing upon public or even private
rights, but simply to determine our rights
on the premises by civil suit. We expect'
to commence the construction of one of
the best bulldlngapn the coast within .two
or three years, ana we would not want to
become tangled up In lawsuits and have
our property remain untenanted after our

s-ij-JWO of Australasia's champion bicy
!i cle , riders ark now In this c'.ty. en
j[ route to Parts, where they expect to
compete in the world's championship
races to be held during the exposition.
They are W.Tiercey and E. Reynolds,
and if an.' athletic appearance, coupled
with determination, counts for anything
they should make 3. good showing against
the world's crack riders.
Australasia's representatives were cho
sen at a championship meeting held in
Wellington, N. Z.J last March. The dis
tances were a half mile and one, three,
five and ten miles. In each event there
were from twelve to fifteen competitors
and some of the finishes were very close.
The haif-mile and ten-mile champion
ships were won by Tierney, while the one,
three and five mile championships were
won by Reynolds. Tierney finished sec
ond to Reynolds in the three and five mile
races, while Reynolds finished second to
Tlerr.ey In the ten-mile race.
"I think we will be able to hold our own
in Pnrls and show the world's cracks that
New Zealand knows a little about bicycle
riding," said ilr. Tierney yesterday. "The
time made in any of our races is no cri
terion of speed, as our tracks are some
thing awful. We have to ride with a rigid
seat and our tires not fully pumped up or
else we would be bumped off half a dozen
times in a half-mile run. Mr. Reynolds
holds the world's record of 2:10 for a milo
over a grass track.
"From here we go to New York and
thence to Liverpool. At Birmingham.
England, we will get our pacing machines
and then we go to Paris. I think I will
only enter in the sprinting races, but Rey
nolds is going in for all the champion
ships.
"In the colonies a man has to race from
start to finish. Every quarter of a mile a
new pacer takes hold of you and carries
you along so that in a ten-mile run you
are going almost as fast at the finish as
you were at the start. "When Reynolds
took to bicycle riding It was thought he
was going into consumption. Now he has
a chest measurement of thirty-five inches,
with a nine-inch expansion. We come
here as the representatives of the .League
of New Zealand Wheelmen and have let
ters to some of the California boys who
are Interested In the sport. On our return
from P.iris we expect to remain several
months in the United States."
Tierney stands 0 feet 10 inches, weighs
165 pounds and has a chest measurement
of 39 inches. Reynolds stands 5 feet 9
Inches and weighs lfil pounds. Tierney's
forte Is unpaced riding, and of him the
New Zealand Herald says:
"%V. Tierney has been recognized this
season ns one of the best (if not the best)
unpaced riders in the colony, and latterly
ho has taken his light from under a
bushel and it has shone forth with a great
shine."
Tierney was a great friend of Allen
Jones, the California bicyclist, who went
to Australasia two years ago. He say.s
Allen could not get used to the rough
tracks he had to ride over in the colonies
and In consequence won very few races.
He was thrown from his wheel. racing at
Adelaide and never recovered . his form
after the accident. When they left the
colonies Jones was running a cyclery in
Melbourne and was doing well.
S. Driflln, a handicap rider of note In
Australia and New Zealand, accompanies
Reynolds and Tierney and expects to do
considerable racing at the Paris Exposi
tion also.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CtilCAdO. June 1.â The California team
will compete .In its last meet for the year
Â¦to-morrow., it. will be ;the Western, inter
collegiate gatnes. The entries show that
of twenty-one colledp.s'in the association
all but- two vfill . compete, ' Grinnell and.
Iowa failing to. come in. There are 3G7 en
tries' in the sixteen events. This shows
clearly that , the competition both indi
vidually and as colleges will be very j
c1qsÂ«. The only man who is sure of, his
event is Flaw of California. There are '
26 entries in the 100 yards; 26 in the 220 ;
yards; 2i> in the quarter mile; 2S In the '
half mile; 25 In the mile; 24 in the high
hurdien; 26 in the low hurdles; 8 in the
mile walk; 22 In the high jump; 29 in the
broad jump; 15 lit the pole vault; 22 in the
shotpui;.il in the hammer throw; 24 in
the discus throw: 2<> in the mile bicycle
race, and 27 in the quarter mile bicycle |
â¢ contest.
Michigan goes into the contest looking :
like the winner, but Chicago and Califor- }
nia have not civen up hope. Wisconsin (
also has a very strong team. California j
would be an almost sure winner if Hoff- j
man, Broughton and Walsh were in con- j
dition. but such is our luck, and we will
have to make the best of it. Every one
of our men are^ determined to run them
selves out, as it is their last game. It is
rather .hard to give a forecast of the |
events, because the men in these colleges Â¦
are from different parts of the West, and
Â¦they have been timed with all kinus of j
watches, but I will, with the aid of the
official handlcapper of the A. A. U., C
O. Duplessis, attempt it:
100 yardsâ Seiblee. Michigan, first, 10 seconds;
Slack, Chicago, second 10 1-5; Drum, California.
220 yardsâ Cayon. Illinois, first, 22 2-5: Cado
gan. California, second, 22 3-5; Slack, Chicago,
third. 22 3-5.
440 yardsâ Looks like easy thing for Maloney.
â¢Chicago 49 4-5; Slack. Chicago, second. :50;
Tietzel. Michigan, :51 2-5.
Half-mileâ Maloney, Chicago, 2:00: Barrett,
Michigan, 2:01; Service, California, 2:02.
Mileâ Hahn, Wisconsin. 4:32: Baker, North
western, 4:33; Huibert. Chicago. 4:33.
Mile walkâ Bredsteen. Wisconsin, 7:06 3-5;
Davis, Chicago, 7:20; Walsh, California, 7:24.
Not much Is known of bicycle riding, but the
principal fleht will be between Brown of Chl
capo. McDougal of Notre Dame and Sudhelmer
nf MlnnpROtn_
High hurdlesâ McLean, Michigan, :15 4-5: Ma
loney Chicago, :16: Hamlln, California, :16 2-5.
Low hurdlesâ McLean, Michigan. :26; Malo
ney. Chicago, :26; Woolsey. California, :26 1-5.
The hammer throw is a snap for Plaw, 170
feet 6 inches; Mortimer, Chicago, 131 feet;
Vicr3. Illinois. 130 feet. - Â¦'
Shot putâ Plaw California. 42 feet 2 Inches;
Woolsey. California, 41 feet 11 Inches; Eg&man,
Notre Dame, 41 feet.
Discus throwâ France, Michigan. 12S feet;
Schmahl, Chicago, 112 feet; Granke, Wisconsin.
108 feet. â¢Â¦ _
Pole viultâ Would be easy thing for Hoffman,
but his leg will not permit his entering.
Wheeler, Wisconsin. 10 feet 10 Inches; Dvorak.
Michigan. 10 feet 10 inches; Magee, Chicago, 10
feet Â» inches.
HlKh Jumpâ Armstrong. Michigan, 6 feet;
Bishop. Wisconsin. 5 feet 10 inches; Schmahl,
Chicago, 5 feet 8 Inches.
Broad JumrÂ»-McLean. Michigan. 23 feet;
Shule, Wisconsin. 22 feet 2 Inches; Pettit. Chi
cago. 21 feet ? Inches.
These times and distances are records
of men and not what they will-do to-mor
row. Although Borne of. the records look I
as if they were timed with an alarm j
clock, most of them are true.
The condition of the California boys has
not chansred since yesterday, and we will
go into the meet greatly handicapped by
disabled men.

AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
No one will grudge Congress a. right to adjourn
now and get away fmm the heat of Washington, but
at the same time; the country will expect the states
men to remember to mr.ke up at the next session what
was left undone in this one. The Nicaragua canal
bill, the merchant marine bill and a revision of the
war ta* come very near being emergency measures
and should not be left for the next Congress to deal
"â¢Vltll.
DOUBTLESS there will be much in the way of
adverse criticism, complaint, and antagonism
to the recommendations concerning the regu
lation of athletic sports at the universities in the re
port submitted by the committee appointed for that
purpose and representing the universities of Califor
nia, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, Harvard, Princeton
and Pennsylvania. A movement for reform never
takes place until there is an evil to eradicate, and the
forces which bring about the evil are certain to op
pose and to hamper the reform no matter how wisely
it be directed. In -he present case, however, the
authorities that propose the reform are so high and
have given so much study to the subj'ect the general
public will not be easily persuaded to deem them
wrong. Therefore, whoever undertakes to condemn
their conclusions and to oppose the adoption of their
recommendations will have to give very valid rear
sons indeed for doing so, or otherwise will profit
little by his labor.
The committee, after an examination extending
over a considerable period of time, find that many
abuses have grown up among the universities by
reason of the rivalries engendered by athletic contests.
It is noted that many students are tempted by the ex
citements of athletic sports to neglect their studies.
The keenness of the rivalry leads certain elements
in the university to encourage men to enter the in
stitution not to study, but solely to strengthen the
various university teams. In some cases ofFers are
made to pay athletic young men for their services on
the teams. Finally, the attendance at the public
games between the champions of noted universities
yields such large rewards in money there is an entice
ment to students to enter upon something very much
like professional sport for gain.
The report sets forth with careful elaboration many
of these bad practices and the evils that result from
them. The statements are strong, and while some of
tHem may seem to be exaggerated, it will be remem
bered by the public that the men who make them have
thoroughly studied the subject and are familiar, with
it, and being university men themselves, are certainly
not biased against university athletics. They say: "At
present athletic sports occupy a disproportionate
amount of attention in many of our universities, col
leges and schools, and the 'main end of all rules must
be to prevent outdoor sports and physical exercises
from interfering with tlfe mental and moral training
of the students. If that cannot be done, the sports bid
fair to become a positive evil." :^v
According to the summary made public, the report
recommends that there shall be no intercollegiate
contests on any except university athletic fields; that
"no student shall be a member of both the freshman
and university teams; that no student shall represent
his university in more than one branch of sport in a
single academic year without permission from the ath
letic committee; that no student shall represent the
university if he has been dropped from his class into
, a lower class or from the first year class out of the
university; that no student shall receive his board free
at the training table; that there shall be no summer
team practice excepting for ten days before the open
ing'of the fall term, ?nd that no tickets shall be sold
to the general public for intercollegiate contests until
the students themselves have had the first chance to
buy." Â¦
The proposed rules leave ample scope for such gen
erous rivalry among the universities as to encourage
young men to athletic sports and healthful exercise.
It is to be hoped they will be generally adopted and
given a fair trial.
UNIVERSITY ATHLETICS.
vast majoritv of fair-minded men agree
with my thesis. The citizenship of priest
or preacher is Just as deep, as high, as
broad as the citizenship of lawyer or doc
tor. Therefore priest and preacher have
as much right to employment in Berkeley
as any other man. But behold the won
der. There are preachers without number
in Berkeley. No priest ever held a posi
tion there. It is not on record that any
priest was ever proffered a position.
In the territory tributary to Berkeley
Practically seven people out of sixteen
are 'Catholic. Yet the number of Catho
lics on the university rolls is exceedingly
smaal. To explain this fact we must
suppose either that the church* is hoÂ»tUe
to the university aÂ» a university or that
parents have reasons of their own for
not fending their children there.
aow, it is not true that the church" is
? i. to tne university as a university,
or tnat she condemns all systems of ed
ucation not given under her own control,
ihe church has hrr own Ideal of educa
tion, and to realize that ideal she ha$
her own institutions as becomes her who
is the mother of all learning. But she
8?,^ not for that reason quarantine her
children against universities where they
may gain certain secular information and
reap certain social or professional advan
tages. All she demands Is that her chil
dren have fair play. When that fair play
is secured, aye even when there 13 n hop*
of securing It, she prudently makes her
accommodations. The great Catholic
schools of New York State are In touch
with the regents of the University of New
York because Catholics have such repre
sentation among the regents that Catho
lic rights are secure from unjust aggres
sion. In Oxford and Cambridge Catholic
students frequent the schools, and there
have been established in these towns
houses or agencies to see that Catholic
boys receive no detriment. If the church
wore opposed to Berkeley as Berkeley
there would not be a Catholic on its
rolls.
As to Catholic parents, who can blame
them if they see In the absence of Catholic
regents and Catholic professors an Inti
mation that, while Catholics may be wel
come enough as students, there is somu
strange fatality which shuts them out
from university emoluments? They are
not reassured by the statement that there
Is no desire to penalize their children or
to discriminate against them. Non licet
argumentare contra factum. The facts
are there and facts are most persuasive.
Now, let me say that I am one of those
who regret and have always regretted this
state of affairs. I do not believe that the
Catholic community should shut itself in
with walls of brass. I believe that as we
bear our civic burdens shoulder to should
er with our brethren. Jew and gentile.
Catholic and Protestant, so we should en-
Joy our civic rights, share and share
alike. Especially in this matter of tho
State University, as we contribute to Its
support, so we should be able to partake
of its advantages. I would not have Cath
olics a caste or a class apart. I believe
In Catholic colleges because I believe in
religious education and In freedom of edu
cation, but I believe, too. that there are
many scholastic advantages which not
only Catholic cÂ« Meges. but all other pri
vate Institutions, might enjoy by the co
operation of the State University. But
before there can be such co-operation
there must be fair play to all ar.d a gen
erous recofjnition of every class In the
community. To promote that consumma
tion I have written this article, and ho
who shall be in any way Instrumental in
bringing it about will have deserved well
of learning and of the State. Yours truly,

ADVErVTISlNG FENCES.
EDITOR THE CALLâ In dealing with
the relations between the "great uni
versities" and the "small colleges" I
left Berkeley out of the question.
This method of treatment fs con
venient for a number of reasons. In the
first place, whatever Is true of Stanford
as a college is also true of Berkeley as a
college. Dr.- Wheeler belongs to the same
school of educationalists as Dr. Jordan.
The kind of education given in both In
stitutions Is practically identical. :As a
result we have two Stanforda or two
Uerkeleys, and what holds for the college
at Palo Alto holds for the college across
the bay.
The fact that Berkeley is a State In
stitution and that Stanford is a private
enterprise gives the college education im
parted at Berkeley no superiority over this
college education imparted at Stanford,
at St. Mary's College or at the Univer
sity of the Pacific. Becauso Berkeley is
a State Institution is no reason why its
graduates should be entitled, In the face
of the State, to any rights or privileges
not enjoyed by all other graduates of the
same degree. Berkeley belongs to ail the
people, is supported by the taxes of all
the people and. therefore, . should be just
to all the people. Now the right of
parents to determine where and by whom
their children should be educated is a
popular right. When out of their gen
erosity the people give a free education
to the children of a certain section of the
population, the generosity of the people
stops at giving the education and does not
adu the privilege of depriving children of
other sections of the population of their
just dues. To give a single civic advant
age to the graduates of the State Uni
versity is to attack freedom of education.
Such advantage would infallibly lead to
a trust, a monopoly. Who would send
his child to a private school it" the State
showers its benelits only on its own
wards?
Because Berkeley Is a public Institution
all the people have rights In it and it has
duties toward the State. Stanford can ac
cept or reject whom it pleases, for any
reason or for none: so can any other pri
vate institution. Berkeley must be open
to all on the same conditions. It must not
pick and choose between classes of the
population. It must not make It easy for
some to enter, and bar the doors against
others who are their scholastic equals.
As the people have rights in Berkeley,
so Berkeley has duties toward the people.
It should do honest work itself, and it
should stand ready with the consent of
private institutions to guarantee the er
liciency of their work.
But how are we to know that Berkeley
does honest work? How are we to know
that if asked it would give an honest
judgment? On the answer to these two
questions depend the relations of Berkeley
to the private institutions.
A State University, because it is a State
University, does not always give honest
work. In fact, when a State institution is
run as a private preserve there is more
than suspicion that it is not living up to
Its professions. As I had no desire to say
u word derogatory of the gentlemen who
teach at Palo Alto, so I have no desire- to
say a word derogatory of the professorate
of Berkeley. But every one knows that
there is as much skimping and pretense,
backing and tilling, In Berkeley as else
where. 'Men have come out of it with
academic degrees who, to say the least,
obtained them on easy terms and whoso
mt-ntal equipment and methods of speech
did not always tend to increase the
scholastic reputation of their alma mater.
Therefore the public must ask the ques
tion. Who shall watch the watchers?
If Berkeley is to watch over the interests
of education in California, who shall
watch over Berkeley? The scheme of
making one man responsible for tne
leaching will not work. This fad which
has had such disastrous results when ap
plied to municipal government is equally
inefficacious when applied to university
government. It is beyond the power of
any mortal man to supervise in any
efficacious manner the teaching body and
the student body in Berkeley. He has
against him at least the dead weight pf
permanent officialdom and the masterly
inactivity upon which the labors of Her
cules would be spent In vain. One man
power is opposed to all democratic ideals
and especially to all university ideals.
Perhaps if the one man were also the
owner of the State he might put his meas
ures through; but where he is only the
hired co-servant of those for whose work
he is supposed to vouch, the result is In
evitable. If he Is discreet, if he sees lit
tle and says less, peace will enme on him
like a dove. If he tries to do his duty to
the people, there Is muttering, then
wrath, then the storm and behold his
place knows him no more. He passes, but
the Incompetent remain and Don Quixote
goes down before the sheep.
Who shall watch tho watchers? Only
a body that Is independent of the teach
ing staff, that holds the teaching staff in
the hollow of its hand and that has in
centive to eee that the teaching staff
does its work. Such a body would be a
representative board of regents. TJiere
is no reason why a board of university
regents should be made up solely pf law
yers and capitalists. That board stands
for the people to see that the school does
its proper work for the people. Therefore.
It should represent not one or two classes,
but as far as possible every class and
more especially those concerned In educa
tional work. A truly representative board
made up of men whose Interest it is to
set out of the university value for the
public will contain in itself its own source
of energy and efficaciousness. Where
there are divers interests one will watch
the other. This is the theory of our civil
government: it should be the practice of
our university government.
It is to the advantage of the State, It
is to the advantage of the private educa
tional enterprises that there should be not
only good teaching In the State Univer-
The last census was unsatisfactory in almost every
particular, and many well sustained complaints were
n:ade of a deficiency in the count. Efforts have been
made with especial care this time to get an accurate
enumeration of the people, and there can be little
doubt they will be crowned with a high degree of suc
cess. In the Eastern cities the people thoroughly un
derstand the advantage which will result to themselves
in giving cordial assistance to the census officers in
maldng the count, and accordingly the population of
those cities will be justly and fully recorded in the re
sults. The citizens of San Francisco must show an
equal civic patriotism. Let us see to it that we have
a fair count and a full count, so that we may be given
among the cities of the Union the rank and prestige
belong to us of right. t ' :
The Call has already directed attention to the cir
cular issued by the census officers requesting persons
who are to be absent from the city during the two
weeks when the count of the population is made to
ai range so that their names and the desired informa
tion concerning them may be obtained by the enu
merators. It is to be hoped that the request has been
duly heeded and complied with. Little or no trouble
is required to fulfill all that has been asked in that re
gard, and if any one now absent or intending to be
absent has neglected to leave the information they
should do so at once.
THE CITIZENS AND THE CENSUS.
SO far as lies in his power every citizen of San
Francisco should aid the census officials in ob
taining a prompt and thoroughly comprehen
sive count of" the population of the city, and such
other information as the census bureau has undertaken
to compile. To any particular individual it may ap
pear a matter of little moment whether he be included
ir the enumeration or not, but a moment's intelligent
reflection upon the subject will show that such appear
ance is deceptive. The interest of each and all citi
zens will certainly be promoted by whatever promotes
the welfare of the whole community, and a count
which manifests for the city a large increase of popu
lation during the past decade will undoubtedly have
a potent influence in directing the attention of capital
ists and business men to San Francisco and thus tend
to advance the general prosperity in many ways.
sity but that there should be some guar
antee of the teaching In private Institu
tions if these private institutions demand
it Because certain tax-paying citizens
engage in the same work as Berkeley
they do not thereby forfeit the right
which every other citizen has in that in
stitution. They have a claim on it for
such service as it can give them. As tne
university stands at present many of
these private institutions have little con
fidence in the ability of Its teaching staff
and less in their fairness. These institu
tions have no representative on the gov
erning body of the university to safeguard
their rights and look out for their in
terests. Until they I^ave such a represen
tative they would be untrue to the pa
rents who patronize them, (untrue to trie
students under their charge were they to
give the State University the slightest say
in their affairs. .
A State university- not run as a private
concern would be of Incalculable value to
California. No citizen wants second-rate
education when he is paying for first
rate. No educator wants poor teaching
when he can get good teaching. But there
are worse evils than poor teaching and it
is because we dread these evils we often
times suffer things to remain which we
would gladly have otherwise.
To treat the relations of the religious
bodies to the university, and consequently
the relations of the sectarian colleges, is
to touch a difficult and thorny subject.
The so-called orthodox Protestant pul
pits are not satisfied with Berkeley, and
Oakland often resounds to the charge ol
theological horse, foot and artillery. I
have no desire to mingle myself In the
pious disputations of the brethren. They
are perfectly competent to fight their own
battles without outside help or interfer
ence.
1 would, however, draw attention to
certain facts concerning the attitude of
Berkeley toward the Catholic communion,
which may not be without interest to
Catholics and non-Catholics alike. I wish
to speak with all moderation and to pre
sent only unquestioned facts. Catholics
claim nothing from the State 8ave what
they are willing to allow to others. They
ask their rights and fair play, not as
boons, but because they would not be
good Americans to be content with less.
The Catholic church Is, apart entirely
from its religious aspect, the largest ed
ucational force in California after the
State. It reaches more pupils and spends
more money than all the private agencies
put together. Its adherents number a
good third of the taxpayers of the State.
Their money goes into the coffers of the;
State University, as does the money of
non-Catholics. On this title alone Cath
olics are interested In the -working of
Berkeley, and have a right to make their
opinions heard.
Now, when we consider the relations of
the State University to the Catholic cit
izens of California, we are struck by cer
tain significant facts.
In the first place the conduct of the uni
versity is committed to the Board of Ke
gents. They are appointed from time to
time by the Executive and represent "the
people of the Slate. Up to two years ago
there had not been a single Catholic on
the Board of Regents. At present there
is one. If the Regents were divided in re
ligious belief a.i is the population of Cali
fornia, there should be six or seven Cath-
Of course, it may be said that Regents
are selected for their administrative abll
itv not for their religion. If the statement
is' not true, it should be true. But surely
administrative ability is not entirely lack
ing among Catholics. If I put a hundred
marbles into a bag. seventy-hye of them
red and twenty-five white. If I carefullj
shake these marbles together and then,
without looking, pick a -Â«|o*en. at random
it will be a most extraordin%ry thing if I
happen to draw out twelve red. If from
time to time I continue to^draw from the
bag and draw only the red ones the phe
nomenon will be still more extraordinary.
Yet this is precisely what happens in
Berkeley. It may have come about with
out design, but that it did is in the high
est degree improbable. â¢
in the second place, there is only one
Catholic -professor in" Berkeley.. I do not
know thr number of the faculty, there
fore I cannot say what the natural per
centaeÂ«Â» Â«hould bo. There are one or two
Cathoifc instructors and a few employes
but altogether the number of ,>Â£ tn ;?'Â£ s
drawing pay from Berkeley could be com
nuted on the lingers of one hand.
Again it may be said that professors are
not chosen for religion's sake but 'or
iparnine Perhaps so. Still heTe is a curi
ous phenomenon. When any religious de
nomination forms a certain P e f r Â« nta Sf e^
the population you will find that^unless
there are disturbing causes the same per
centage prevails in the various avocations
of the population. Doctors, for Instance,
are not supposed to receive their degrees
for religious knowledge; lawyers certainly
do not; and there is a strong suspicion
that business ability is not always con
sequent on church membership, let if
we make a religious census of the pro
fessors we will find that its results closely
approximate to the results of a general
census of the whole population. Thus in
San Francisco half the. people might be
called Catholics of some sort, and as a
matter of fact half of our . doctors and
lawvers may be claimed as Catholics by
some title. The same percentage holds
true of the school teachers. It may be
accidental that Berkeley is such a con
spicuous exception to the rule,
Berkeley was in the beginning a private
sectarian college which was handed over
to the State. The original professors were
to a great extent clergymen, and there Is
a historical reason, therefore, that so
many of the professors to-day should be
ministers of the gospel. I know there are
certain narrow laymen who think a
preacher or n. priest has no rights. Though
preacher and priest bear all the, burdens
of citizenship, there are some who think
that priest and preacher have no knowl
edge of citizenship.- Against such an in
justice I have at 'some cost to my
self protested, and I believe that the

he- gets ready to go. The. question is, why should
there be so much rigor in one case and such easy
yielding in the other? â¢ *
There are countries in. the world where private citi
zens are compelled to wait in fear and trembling be
fore the officers of the law while military dignitaries
stalk along unchecked. We do things differently in
San Francisco. Here the private citizen receives the
honor of a submission on the "part of the law, while
the Major General is treated without any distinction
whatever. Instead of a tug and a special car to speed
him on his journey, he gets a vaccination and an
order to stand aside and wait.
Just why these things should be so is doubtless
capable of an easy explanation, but we shall not at
tempt it. Suffice it to say the people of the United
States have a cordial welcome for the General who
has directed our armies and upheld the cause and the
flag of the country in the Philippines, and it behooves
San Francisco, through her officials and her repre
sentative bodies, to make that welcome manifest here
at the gateway of the republic. General Otis has
served the nation with fidelity and with honor, and
merits every mark of consideration that can be given
him.

So it has passed into a tradition that Tammany
shall not elect a President of the United States and
inoculate the Federal Government with the fetid in
firmities that have made New York a political stink
pot all over the world.
In 1896 Tammany split its seasoned throat in war
whoops for Bryan, and all the Democratic States
within reach went for McKinley.
Tilden, and so near rui electoral majority that Con
gress had to devise novel machinery and rather too
novel methods to find a majority for Hayes. In 1880
Tammany turned up at Cincinnati shouting for Han
cock, who -.vent glimmering, a beloved ghost, into
the land of political spirits. In 1884. at Chicago, Tam
many tore out its own scalplock, soaked its war
painted body in sour mash, chewed tobacco and
swallowed the chaw, in fighting Cleveland, and when
Iron Brigade Bragg of Wisconsin looked at the gang
and cried out. "The country loves Cleveland for the
enemies he has made," the applause rang from ocean
to ocean, but Tammany would have given half its
treasury for a chance to burn the speaker at the
stake. It fought Cleveland through the campaign and
he was elected. It fought him again in 1R88 and beat
him by treachery in New York, and in 1892 it put
Bourke Cockran forward to fight him again, and fight
he did until 3 o'clock in the morning, when the con
vention nominated the ex-President on the first bal
lot and the country elected him on the second.
One of the big chiefs. Mr. Coogan, a red man from
Tipperary, has offered to stake the combination in
the sum of $100,000. good and lawful money won in
New York politics, to be doubled in Federal politics
if Bryan is elected. Sweet peace reigns in the party
councils. Tammany is appeased, and at one with 16
to 1, and putting up money on it like a man.
The situation suggests reminiscence and retrospec
tion. Since the war no Democratic candidate sup
ported by Tammany has prospered. That or
ganization backed McClellan and he was beaten. It
secured the nomination of Seymour, and he was re
jected. It shouted for Greeley, and he was beaten
and died mad. In 1876 it opposed Tilden and fought
him tooth and claw. At St. Louis in the national
convention of that year John Kelly, then chief of Tam
many, stubbornly contested every inch of ground with
Tildcn's supporters. He poured out the vials of Tam
many wrath on the Governor's head and never surren
dered. The result was a large popular majority for
Since then Croker and Brya'n have chummed, and
the wily Tammany leader is convinced that he can
run the Federal Government by proxy as well as that
of New York, and that Bryan is the man. So Tam
many, with uplifted hand, has sworn that it will true
allegiance bear to the Populist nominee and all his
works.
WITH much ceremony, form and conjuring, and
also with oaths taken on the point of its knife
and the edge of its tommyhawk, Tammany has
sworn to support none other than Bryan, and, for
saking all others, to cleave unto 'him until defeat
For a time it was supposed that Mr.. Croker
"leered" elsewhere for a candidate. After he grasped
control of Greater New York, with Judge Van Wyck
acting as his proxy, he showed signs of fondness for
the other Van Wyck as a Presidential nominee. It
it said that he went so far as to call the Saratoga
conference, of last August, as a sort of coming out
party for his proxy's brother, and started from his
horse barn, somewhere in Kent, to reach the meeting
and. introduce the coy debutante. But he was met
down the bay by a party of Tammany braves, who
said something to him with a freshly baited breath,
and Croker, King of New York, walked down the
gangplank shouting for Bryan. The conference at
Saratoga lost its strength quicker than if it had over
used the mild aperient waters of that resort, and the
members fared homeward, marveling why they had
been called out at all. It is said that the message
which changed Croker was to the effect that the
Van AVyck government of New York' is ab$ut all
of the Van Wyckedness that the country can stand
at one time* and it was not politic to fatigue the whole
family with the cares of government.
TAMMANY'S CHOICE.

Mtjsiaid Bryan has announced a willingness to let
bis running mate this year, provided
thÂ£. Democrats of the State agree in making the se
'â¢ertjon. and it is safe to say that if there be anything
that Tammany wishes just now. short of writing
.jit-. platform and naming the Presidential candidate,
VSrysn will consent without blushing-

| rn MOXG the news items of yesterday was one
[ I \ which began in this way: "Like a Peri at the
i gate, General Otis is waiting to get into the
i country. He may be allowed to land in one or two
j days, but it is more than probable it will be Sunday
J or Monday before he leaves the transport. Much
; depends on how long it takes the General to 'take,'
â¢ for until his vaccination shows signs of doing busi
! ness he will have to remain a passenger on the Meade.
I It may be, however, that the General is immune, for
; vaccination is as common to an army officer in the
; Philippines as a Sunday dinner, and in that case if
| he run over time he will be let go anyway. So the
j problem of the General's landing is somewhat patho-
I logical. |
Among the news items of the loth of last October
I was one that began thus: "Alfred Gwynne Vander
i bilt, younger son of the late Cornelius Vanderbilt,
| stopped on his tour around the world by the news of
j the death of his father, arrived in San Francisco har
j bor yesterday afternoon on board the steamer City
I of Peking. Almost before the quarantine and cus
toms officers had completed their duties and before
the vessel had reached her dock the heir to most of
! his father's millions was whisked on a tug by waiting
! friends, carried across the bay to Oakland mole, con
; ducted to a palatial special car and guarded from in
; trusiori until he was started eastward at the end of
The two stories present an interesting question con
cerning the flexibility of quarantine regulations in the
hands of officials strong enough to bend them. Otis
I is an officer of the United States, holding the rank of
'Â¦ Major General, and is now on hfs way from the field
! of his service in"; Manila -to confer with the President
I upon the military situation there. He arrives at this
! port ajid finds the quarantine law absolutely rigid.
The quarantine officer is unbending. He bows not to
the rank and dignity of a Major General nor con
i cerns himself with the urgency of military matters,
i The General has to. wait, and while. he is waiting a
I yellow journal of the city caricatures him in a coarse
i cartoon marked "Quarantined." Young Vanderbilt
i is a private citizen, who has rendered no service to
the country and is not expected to render any. .He
arrives at this port and the law droops before him.
The quarantine official kow-tows to him and a tug
takes him from the steamer as soon as in his leisure

When the doors of the Immense flve-
story structure at 117 to 121 Geary street
open for business this morning they. will
swing under a new name and a new
managementâ a name old and famed In
Central and Northern California, but a
name comparatively unknown to the- pur-
chasing public in: San Francisco. ... :.:â¢ .;-â¢ : :
The new name Is that of the JOHN
BREUNER COMPANY, a firm estab-
lished In Sacramento way back In 185S by
one of California's pioneers â a firm that
to-day conducts, on the corner of Sixth
and K streets, in California's capital, the
largest and most complete general house-
furnishing: establishment on the entire
Pacific Coast. .
This Is the firm that has purchased out-
ripiu the entire stock, business and fix-
tures of the California Furniture Com-
pany (N. P. Cole & Co.) of this city, thÂ«
change of ownership taking effect this
day.
It Is unnecessary to dwell at length
upon the firm of X. P, Cole & Co. â you of
San Francisco know them. For twenty-
five years they have stood In the front
rank of San Francisco's furniture stores.
Their name has stood always for every-
thing that was reliable In soods and
honorable in dealing 1 . ..
The new business will be conducted
temporarily at the present locationâ 117
to 121 Geary street; but meanwhile a new
and more commodious building will ba
erected for the firm on Market street,
between Fifth and Sixth. This new build-
Ing will be completed about April 1, 1901.
At present only furniture, curtains and
draperies will be handled In the Geary-
street store; but we assure you that In
these lines we will offer you an absolutely
complete stock to choose from at prices
that shall be based on the closest possible
margin of profit compatible with good
business.
Welcome to look or buy at .any time.

be used to; place all individual combina

"The.- issue presented .In the campaign of

CLOSING; OF AMERICAN V
iK CONSULATE At -HAWAII
WASHINGTON, .June-li-'The House of
Representatives to-day, after a lively de
bate . extending over two days, defeated
the Joint resolution proposing a constltu-.:
tlorral amendment, empowering Congress
to regulate trusts;. It requires, a. two
thirds, vote under. the constitution toadopt:
an amendment to the constitution;.: The
voto stood ayes 154, noes 131C ! , . ; .
The affirmative:- vote;, therefore, was!
thl^y-eight -short.' or -the requisite ;two
thlrds. 182. Five Pemocrats-r-Campbell of;
MuiUan*; Naphen of 'Massachusetts,-;
Seudder ofVcvy York, Sibley -af .Permsyl-^
vania ami. Thayer of. Massachjis.ettsâ and,
one SHverite-^Newiands of Nevadaâ voted
with the Republicans for the resolution,
and two Itepublicahsâ Uoudipf Gaaifprnia
and McCall of Massachusettsâ with^ the
Democrats. These were the only . breaks:
from party lines. The Populists .voted,
solidly against the resolution. ; .. '
The debate preeeding : Ihe vote had a
strong political flavor throughout and- was;
at times very personal. The/features Were
the closing speeches of De Armond of Mis^
sourland Llttlefield of Maine for the re
spective sides; and the short, speech -of
McCall of Massachusetts against th^.res
oluUon.. - McCall has distingu<shed hirhr
self before: during this session In opposing
the action! of his .colleagues on the Porto
Rlcan bill. His action to-day was unher-'
aided and, therefore attracted, the . more
attention:/; 'â¢''.Â¦Â¦Â¦'â¢. Â¦Â¦'.-. '.';.â¢'" â¢:;Â¦'

first" speaker. 'He advocated the adoption
of the amendment.': \: <Â¦> . -._:.Â¦: .-

charge that the Republicans had' no'in
tention of putting through both houses
either the; pending, resolution .or the Ut
tlefietd bill.-. :â¢ : Â¦ ; : --. : '
Hamilton of Michigan said If there' was
tb be control of trusts it must be exer
cised by tho Federal Government, and a :
constitutional, amendment such, as was
proposed. In the pending resolution was
essential.- . ; ' Â¦ -. . â¢ . .."Â¦Â¦. Â¦;':.Â¦
NewlandS; of Nevada said he Agreed
with the- minority that the proposed 'con
stitutional, amendment was a makeshift,
intended, to meet a political emergency,
and. without Intention of finally
being .; incorporated In the : Constitutions
But. he said, he. diftered with the minor-:
ity asto what should be done.; He woiJld
vote, for it" because he believed- the Fed^
eral .Government should have- enlarged
powers rather, than that: It Â¦ shoultt hot
exercise any power at all. He appealed
to the Democrats to Join lit passing- the
resolution and sending it to the Republi
can â¢ Senate. Let the. Senate,.; he urged,
take the responsibility of defeating it:: , , : .
Thayer of Massacliusetts defined a trust
aÂ» something which. Mr, Harina could hot
palm off as the result of thrift, push and
tair.dea.ling of the American: people.'

Grosyenor of Ohio devoted a fewrnln-.

trusts. ' Â¦.'.: â¢ ;â¢ â¢; : ; .. : . :;â¢ : "Â¦â¢ . " â¢ ':Â¦. , '..' .
' l>hiz of Ohio, said .it- was exceedingly
pleasant .for h!ni to hear Grosyehor. apol
ogize fort the third time for the treatment
of -Attorney-General Monnett by the: Re
publican party of Ohio. Monrieitt, he saitl,
had prosecuted one trust in phio in- spite
of the ; temptation of a, bribe 0f J40p,0d0-und
in spite of the : browbeating . of -.the -Re^
publican press; of the Sta.tÂ«.-..;Lentz then
had read ftn : interview &f. the date of;- May
19, 1500,: with Mtrnriett, Â¦ in which he. pire
dtcted that tho Republicans :bf: the^ State'
would; be: punished for their treatment .'-ot
the trusts.: s . ;.'-\v. â¢* ;. â¢: Â¦Â¦ .-'.-.i.;.;' - : 'â¢â¢ -.- : â¢' â¢
. ."MrJ Â¦ Monnett ' does Â¦ not eiy : . 'he . ?pas '

. "You know," replied Lentz,' 1 "that >Ir. :
Monnett was acandidate for.Gbverhtjr as
the champion : of the : people, against
trusts, yc:t 'not. a single ::RepubHcah dele-i
gate dared raise his voice in his favor.
He got but twenty-eight votes.: 1 You have
a reputation as a mathematician. Here is
a problem for you: If Mr. Monnett, for
fighting one trust, got only twenty*elght
votes, now: many, votes would he have re
ceived if he bad fought all the trusts?"
(Applause and laughter.)
Pearce of Tennessee read a signed.In
terview with General Grosvenor, printed
some time ago, declaring that a consti
tutional amendment was unnecessary to
deal with the trusts. After' further re
marks by Reeves of Illinois and Clayton
of New York, De Armond of Missouri
closed the debate for his side with a
an Interesting statement In regard, to
Chinese commerce last year, which., the
Consul says, was characterized' by.' an
astonishing development. The net value
of the import trade for 1899 was $1SS.1O3.77S.
double that of 1S90. The importation of
opium was overta million pounds in excess
of. the Imports during the preceding year.
The trade in cotton goods, which had re
mained practically stationary for three
years, made a great advance, rising from
$54,255,557 in 1S9S to 173,571,917.
"It is a humiliating fact," says Consul
General Goodnow. "that of the total ton
nage of vesels entering and clearing from
Chinese ports lnst ye'arythtr United States
only contributed one per cent; of the total
tonnage .entering from foreign ports the
American flag lloated over only three per
cent." ' : : Â¦' \: Â¦.Â¦.'Â¦'Â¦Â¦. â¢ â¢ ;Â¦Â¦â¢â¢â¢ :,:Â¦

PEOPLE'S DAY CROWDS
HOPKINS ART INSTITUTE
New Pictures by De Haas, Julian Ebc
-_r ' ; and Others Attract At
- r -.:'; tention. (
"People's Day" at the Hopkins Art In
stitute attracted a considerable crowd of
picture-lovers yesterday ' afternoon. Much
interest was manifested in the new battle
picture, Â¦ "A Naval EngaRement at New
Orleans." b"y De Haas, which is the latest
acquisition of the gallery. This De Haas
is from the celebrated collection of Mrs.
Kate C. Johnson, and is a worthy second
to the fine marine picture by which De
Haas was before represented In the gal
lery.
â¢ The large "still life" subject and the Ju
lian RIx landscape. gift3 of Mr. Hunting
ton, also came in for a large share of at
tention. The still life ia a most execel
lent thins of its kind, absolutely, ridicu
lously still-lifelike. Whether its kind 13
worth while on so large a scale is another
question. The Rix landscape- is in the
later and finer manner of the artist, and
both these pictures are undoubted acqui
sitions to the' srallery.

City Treasurer Brooks . Succeeds in
Collecting $10, 5O7i39 From the Â¦
{ State for Commissions.. :;
The general ,-furid of } the city was eri-.
riched unexpectedly yesterday by the ad
dition of $10,507 39., which . represents the
6 per cent commissions earned by the city
for collecting the taxes for 1899.
Last year, the State Controller, on the ap
plication of Treas.urer Trurrtari, refused to
allow, the commission, on'-, the ground- that
counties of the tlrst class: were not entitled
to it This â¢ accordingly excluded San
Francisco. â¢ .Uos Angeles, -and Alameda
from- the- 'benefits of tlio statute.
Treasurer Brooks, in. ; making his la.st :
settlement with the State, contended that
no exception should- be â¢ made, and his
opinion was concurred in by the Attorney;
General, to : whom the was re
ferred: The city was therefore allowed
to retain the money and It will accord
ingly reduce : the prospective municipal
deficit -by more than $10,000.

Through her unflagging efforts the death
rate in the barracks hospital at Scutari,
which she found at 60 per cent, was re
duced to a fraction over 1 per cent. Then
she felt it her duty to cross the Black
Sea to do what she could to alleviate the
sufferings in the hut hospitals of Bala
clava. Here competent heip was even,
more difficult to secure than at Scutari,
and the protracted strain finally brought
about the long-feared result over which
her friends* had been so apprehensive.
Florence Nightingale succumbed to the
Crimean fever, and for several weeks lay
at the point of death. Shortly after her
recovery the one and a half years' war
came to a close, and its heroine slipped
quietly home, an invalid for life. Too un
assuming to accept any personal reward
for her services, or even the carefuily
planned ovation of her grateful country
men, she retired to her Derbyshire home,
for many yrars unable to leave the house.
Her invalid life was anything but idle.
however, for she has worked during the
remainder of her long -life, ameliorating
with her pen the hospital conditions
throughout entire Europe. India and Aus
tralia: her favorite recreation being an
occasional visit to the Nightingale Memo
rial Home, which Knglahd erected at a
cost of. Â£50.000 as a testimonial to her help
fulness during the Crimean war. She pos
sessed a wonderful facility in condensing 1
tedious reports and folios into strikingly
.lucid briefs.' most useful to the engineer,
architect, medical officer and homemaker.
The Crimean war she characterized aa
"a sanitary experiment upon a colossal
scale," and she impressed upon the British
Commissioners its salutary but harrow
ing lessons. In addition to her helpful
books upon the health of the British sol
dier her labors in helping to found the Rel
Cross Society entitle her to the gratitude
of the soldiery of the civilized world. Just
recently in her sevrnty-nlnth year Eng
land has consulted her regarding the- mili
tary hospitals in the Transvaal.
FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE
these early advantages foreign travel
added, its broadening influence. Wherever
she went^she studied the science of nurs
ing; tending with her own hand some
wounded. Arabs whom the family met
while traveling in Egypt, studying for
several months with Pastor Fliedner's
Deaconesses at Kaiserwerth. working
ballads in -which popular enthusiasm ex
tolled:
The N'ightinsale of the east,
. Â¦'. . Â¦ For her heart it means jcood.
And in the Nightingale Home, St. Thomas
Hospital, London, a statuette of the
"Angel of the Crimea" tells the samo

Not so elegant, yet probably a3 sincere aa
ths more polished verse, were thÂ© street
games andlectures for thÂ« convalescents.
Â¦The most -difficult of: all the provinces
was. of course that of nursing, yet it Is
sakl that whoever there was the jrreat
est danger. or distress there the faithful
head was to he found silently superintend
ing, .never allowing a severe case to es
cape her. personal treatment. To accom
plish this she often- stood twenty hours at
a time, and after the doctors had retired
she was. to be seen making her nightly
rounds through miles of suffering pa
tients, shartlrg with her hand the lamp
that she carried, that it might not disturb
the :sick, many of whom aa .Â«he pasned
kissed her shadow on their pillows with
passionate enthusiasm. Longfellow ha*
commemorated this Incident In his ex
quisite "Santa Filomena" with such nyin
pathetlc touch that no biographer of Flor
ence Nightingale can refrain, from quot-
with the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul
of Paris, serving altogether an appren
ticeship of nine years of close study of
the alleviation of suffering before the
critical moment arrived that was to test
her life work. Meanwhile she had great
ly impaired her health by working night
and day : for three, years, putting the
Harley-street Sanitarium upon a sound
financial and scientific footing, thus dem
onstrating indisputably that self-sacri
ficing helpfulness was the first law of her
being.. â¢:. ".
While' recruiting- from the bodily ex
haustion incident to this. work she shared
in the horror agitating all England,
caused by the terrible pictures of suffer
ing which William H. Russell sent to
the London Times from the Crimea, In
these letters he demonstrated so clearly
that the unsanitary condition of the Brit
ish army was killing off more* men than
the deadly battles of the Crimea t h at
England became panic-stricken over the
moftalitv list, yet seemed helpless to cur
tail it. In the hurry and enthusiasm at
the outbreaX of the Crimean war (1S54)
Great Britain had dispatched shiploads of
men improperly provided with food or
clothing for the severe Russian climate.
Starvation, cholera and agonizing suffer
ing were the results. But two persons in
England seenrt-d to retain their compo
sure amid the general consternation-
Lord Herbert. Minister of War. and Flor
ence Nightingale. The former wrote a
letter to his friend. Miss . . Nightingale,
stating that he considered hex â¢ ihe only
person in Great Britain capable of bring
ing order out of confusion, and imploring
her to organize and direct the reform of
the military hospitals, and this letter was
crossed by one from Miss Nightingale,
volunteering to placg her strength and
anility at the service of her nation.
, Good trained nurses were almost un
known quantities in those days, yet, noth
ing daunted, Florence Nightingale sal'ed
from England with thirty j; fÂ»f the best
nurses that she couldV muster within, a
week from her letter of volunteer. Let
ters immediately appeared in the daily pa
pers inquiring who this patriot was, and
when it became known that she was not
the hospital matron of the old regime, but
a young, delicate and singularly accom
plished woman who was about to try to
lessen the hideousness of war, popular
gratitude and enthusiasm became intense,
when her mission: became an accom
plished fact and It was found that her
quiet good sense was able to overcome the
popular prejudice against womanly prom
inence, to conciliate the general disap
proval of medical and military officials;
to train her staff into the knowledge that
mere kind-heartedness was not the only
requisite for intelligent nursing, and to
keep all around her up to the very highest
standards, the national support became
Immediate and practical. So sympathetic
that her grateful patients declared their
recovery to be due to the compassion with
which she dressed their ghastly wounds,
she nevertheless understood so well the
art of tempering her sympathy with meas
ures for ultimate .gain "that outsiders
sometimes lost sight of her tenderness in
her phenomenal; executive energy. 'Â¦/,
Overcoming professional jealousy, by set
ting her nurses an example of obedience
to the surgeons, she set herself to the taslc
of cleansing the Atrgean hospitals, con
taining over 4000 patients. These. barrack
hospitals at Scutari, which had been
loaned to the British Government by thei

NEW YORK. June 1.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
While returns of failures ln May by branches
of business cannot be given until next week, it
can be stated that not over six months in
mere than six years have shown as large de
faulted liabilities as May will show, owing to
the fallurt 1 of a firm principally engaged In
cotton brokerage. The reported liabilities of
this one firm exceed those of all firms falling
In every menth but one last year, and In every
month but three in 1S9S. Manufacturing fail
ures ln four weeks of May were only $2,456,
643. and trading failures â¢ $4,720,301. while fail
ures in brokerage and "other commercial"
lines amounted to $13.928,822., The decline in
cotton to 9 cents and the reduction of regular
print cloths to V/Â» cents at Fall River, with
outside sales at 3 cents, indicate that specula
tion in this case may have somewhat checked
business and Industry. -
The rapid progress of events in Africa, with
propects that the war will en-1 soon and the
gold supply from that region will. be resumed,
has naturally, affected business and security
markets on both sides of the ocean. Needs of
foreign borrowing may be much reduced and
hindrance to foreign Investments here ln large
measure removed. But the demands upon
American machine works and other supplies
are likely to be materially -Increased whenever
the restoration* of .industries in South Africa
begins.
The most conspicuous feature of domestic
news is the steady progress toward a lower
level of prices for the chief materials of indus
try. Without excitement and with very small
Fnl<>s. It Is believed th<Â» smallest ever recorded
in May at the three chief Eastern markets, ex
cept in 1S93, prices of wool have declined so
that the one hundred quotations In Coates Bro
thers' circular would average about 21.84 cents
against 24.72 at the highest point February 1,
and 18.15 a year ago. .The stagnant and hesi
tating condition of the goods market, though
not extending to the most favorite staples,
which are largely sold early ln the season, has
caused much irregularity In prices of goods of
other grades, so that some have been cleared
out , by concessions of 15 to 20 per cent from
the early quotations of the season. There is
also more complaint of ' cancellations, and on
this cccasion In cotton as well as woolen goods.
With prices adjusted to a lower range all tex
tile branches might have expected greater, ac
tivity. . ;< Â¦ Â¦ â¢Â¦'Â¦..Â¦.- >.C
. The change in hides has made . marked pro
gress also, the average at Chicago declining
over 3 per cent for the past week, and thus far
nhput 17 per cent from the highest point. Large
supplies' are mentioned In some grades, but the
weakness of the manufacture has been the con
trolling feature. â¢ . '^
Orders for . bocts \ and shoes have been â¢ re
duced , more than shipments," because many
works had orders which are not yet exhausted.
The shipments ln May have, been smaller than
In any other year since 1892. ; They were larger
by 17.4 per cent. In 1896, by 22.8 per cent In 1505
and by 27.7 per cent last year.
The decline in pigtron continues, gray I forge
reaching $18 50 at Pittsburg; No. 1 local coke
$22 at Chicago; No. 1 anthracite and Bessemer
$22 at Philadelphia: and Lehlgh No. 1 $22 here.
Only small changes have appeared during : the
week in . prices of finished products, t but these
are toward lower â¢ figures. ". There are current

NEW TORK, June 1.â Bradstreet's will say
to-morrow: Readjustments of price quotations
to meet the changed condition of supply and
demand are still the leading features of the
general trade. In volume the business doing
Is of a between-seasons character, improvement
ln some lines being counterbalanced by in
creased dullness in other branches. That the
basic conditions of the trade are ln the main
of a favorable nature, however, is proved by
the continued good railroad earning returns
which come to hand. The facts seem â¢ to be
that the volume of business offered the trans
portation interests of the country continues
considerably In excess of a year ago. . Crop
reports are relatively most favorable as re
gards corn and oats. In the Southwest wheat
crop prospects are still maintained at a high
average. In the Northwest wheat has been
helped by late rains, but owing to their 1 late
arrival it is not certain how much benefit
was obtained thereby. Most prices are lower
on the week, wheat noting a fractional drop
despite unfavorable French crop advices,
whence an enormous reduction in yield Is pre
dicted and also rather blue reports from the
Northwest early in the week, attended in some
respects by the rains mentioned. Pork pro
ducts have sympathized with the downward
tendency of values, aided thereby by increased
receipts of hogs. Some further liquidation has
been noted in cotton and the price has sunk
to 9c. In textiles the situation is rather de
pressed, although some improvement ln re
orders for dry goods is noted at leading Job
bing centers. Print cloths have been marked
down by the Fall River committee, but this
is a tardy recognition of hitherto known facts.
Manufacturers of woolen goods are out of the
market for raw wool and the outlook at pres
ent favors the lightweight woolens upon open-
Ing at lower values. Boots and shoes are dull
and a number of Eastern factories are short
of orders. The hand-to-mouth domestic de
mand for iron and steel continues, but the
number of small orders received Is taken to
indicate that consumers are practically bare
of stocks and any general shut-down for a
month's time, such as is supposed, might lead
to a scramble for supplies. Export business
continues good, though limited by the scarcity
of freight room. Southern pig iron and steel
rails not'nt; mest Inquiry. The situation in
the pipe market Is no better and plates are
also weaker. Concessions of fractions of a
dollar are apparently easily obtained for pig
Iron, but throughout the trade the feeling is
rather more cheerful, the feeling being that
lower prices will on the one hand encourage
consumptive demand and on the other hand
tend to restrict production by less economical
plants. * The settlement of the wage situation
this year might also be a possible source of
restriction of prdductlon.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4.533.140 bushels, against 3.63S,
86S bushels last week. 3.596,065 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899, 5.21S.0S6 bushels in

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. June 1.â The stock market de
veloped an activity and strength to-day which
have been foreign to it for many weeks cast.
The dealings were to a large extent concen
trated in a limited number of stocks, but there
was nevertheless a broadening of the market
and erer.eral gains throughout, even In the less
active stocks. The Industrials and specialties
were emphatically relegated to the background
and with the exception of Sugar and the To
baccos there were no notable points of strength
or features of activity in that department.
It was a movement of railroad stocks decidedly
and the advance was made in the face of a
number of incidents which would have been
quickly seized upon by the bears in the lately
Â¦prevailing temper of speculation to force down
prices. To-day, on the contrary, the outstand
ing shorts were eager to cover their contracts,
and when they sought to secure stocks they
found a very limited amount offered, and the
resulting rise In prices was rapid and sharp.
It was reported in Wall street that a large
short account, amounting to over 20,000 shares
of various stocks, was being closed out pre
liminary to a European tour. The buying of
some individual stocks was attributed to opera
tions by a pool. The opening of the market
disclosed a mood of depression over the dis
appointing effect o( the war news on foreign
markets. Lundon sold about as many stocks in
this market as were bought for that account
yesterday and draRged prices below last nighrs
level. The steel stocks, after fractional ad
vances, turned heavy on the news of closing
down of additional mills and offered no sup
port to the market for the rest of the day.
Sugar hung below last night's prices all day..
In fact, the strength in the Tobacco stocks
was the only notable element of strength in
the industrial departments. A number of re
ports for April showed gains in the gross earn
ings, more than v.-ir>ed out by increased operat
ing expenses. But these reports were I Ignored
and caused no check to the upward tendency
In the railroad list. This found its Inception
In the grander group and spread to Union Pa
cific, the Atchisons and Missouri Pacirtc. It
was attributed to the favorable crop weather
prevailing In the West. Later In the day the
trunk lines came into prominence, led by Balti
more and Ohio, the common rising 4 and the
rreferred Â£U. The market closed active ana
strong at the bert.
There was a good absorption of railroad bonds
at advancing prices. Total sales, par valutr,
$1.4??. OCX
United States refunding 2's, when issued, de
clined ' t and old 4's advanced \i in the bid

Is an occasional variance In foreisn grades

SUmMRX OF THE MARKETS.
NEW YORK, June 1.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review will say to-morrow: Speculative deal
ings have aga^n been of a restricted kind and
the public appear to develop no real interest
In the. stock market. The investment demand
for bonds and dividend-paying stocks continues
to be excellent and It Is apparent that the
floating supply of auch securities is consider
ably smaller than In recent years. The de
velopments of the week have in the main been
of a favorable character. London has reopened
to the successful outcome of the war in South
Africa and the assurances that the gold mines
of the Rand are safe in an advance in which
I American stocks have participated to a cer
tain extent. The buying of our securities for
foreign account has .not, however, been on a
sufficiently large scale to have much practical
influence upon the tone of the market here or
upon current quotations for speculative shares.
Another development Is the decline of exchange
rates to a level which puts an end to any
apprehension as to shipments of gold. Early
this week it became apparent that no further
withdrawals 'of specie either from London or
Paris would be made and the situation in this
respect has shaped itself so that the gold
outflow is over for the season. Money is be
coming decidedly easier in London and the
other foreign I financial centers, open discount
at the British capital -being down to 2?i per
cent, a drop oÂ£ IV* per cent In a month. The
ease of money abroad with the cheerful news
from South Africa seems likely to result in
the development . of a speculative movement
In London of more than ordinary proportions,
although it must be admitted that thus far
the London etock market has taken the situa
tion quietly and docs not seem ' disposed . to
indulge In any overdrawn excitement. Another
circumstance which has had a considerable in-
Huence upon the femper of Wall street Is the
accumulating evidence that the so-called sugar
trade war is practically ended, even if there
has been no formal settlement among the re
fining interests. It has been pointed out for
Borne time that'lhe course of the capitalists in
; terested In the business was one which neces
sitated a compromise when all - parties were
thoroughly tired of their losses. It is certainly
remarkable that the American Sugar Refining
Company and the opposition refineries should
within the last few weeks have advanced prices
to a level which seejns to afford a fair profit
and the speculative public not unnaturally
draws the inference that this Is the result of
an agreement or arrangement among the
parties in Interest. While nothing can be
learned as to the facts there has been heavy
covering of shorts In Sugar stocks and an ad
vance In its price to 120. making it the most
active as well as the strongest feature of the
market. The steel stocks have been irregular
and heavy on the news that further reduc
tions in prices were scored in Western mar
kets. At the same time the liquidation in
these stocks seems to be over and in some
cases covering by a short Interest resulted in
an improvement of their market position. It
may also be said that the Tobacco stocks con
tributed the strength of the general
market because while they showed no decided
Improvement the selling in them has ceased
and the fear of competitive opposition has
diminished. .The railroad list has been strong
to steady, particular attention being paid to
Burlington, Northern Pacific common and
Atchison preferred. In the two latter cases
prospective increases in dividend rates are the
main reason for the support extended to them.
statements that ' some of the properties Just
taken by the Steel Sheet Company have been
sold back to former owners, and that Proper
ties of the Steel Hoop Company will be divid
ed likewise, but it is not at all surprising 11 Â»
few out of so many combinations result in tne
disappointment of some. Probably a ' owe J
quotation for Bessemer pig may be accepted
by the association in the central region ror
the latter half year, as the closing of many
works, owing" to reduced demand, may l e ,& ve
these furnaces without full employment. The
acceptance of two large contracts for export,
one for $100,000 by Southern works, is a good
sign.
Failures for the week have been 160 in the
United States against 143 last year and 21 in
Canada against 14 last year.

NEW YORK. June 1.â R. O. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
While returns of failures ln May by branches
of business cannot be given until next week, it
can be stated that not over six months in
mere than six years have shown as large de
faulted liabilities as May will show, owing to
the fallurt 1 of a firm principally engaged In
cotton brokerage. The reported liabilities of
this one firm exceed those of all firms falling
In every menth but one last year, and In every
month but three in 1S9S. Manufacturing fail
ures ln four weeks of May were only $2,456,
643. and trading failures â¢ $4,720,301. while fail
ures in brokerage and "other commercial"
lines amounted to $13.928,822., The decline in
cotton to 9 cents and the reduction of regular
print cloths to V/Â» cents at Fall River, with
outside sales at 3 cents, indicate that specula
tion in this case may have somewhat checked
business and Industry. -
The rapid progress of events in Africa, with
propects that the war will en-1 soon and the
gold supply from that region will. be resumed,
has naturally, affected business and security
markets on both sides of the ocean. Needs of
foreign borrowing may be much reduced and
hindrance to foreign Investments here ln large
measure removed. But the demands upon
American machine works and other supplies
are likely to be materially -Increased whenever
the restoration* of .industries in South Africa
begins.
The most conspicuous feature of domestic
news is the steady progress toward a lower
level of prices for the chief materials of indus
try. Without excitement and with very small
Fnl<>s. It Is believed th<Â» smallest ever recorded
in May at the three chief Eastern markets, ex
cept in 1S93, prices of wool have declined so
that the one hundred quotations In Coates Bro
thers' circular would average about 21.84 cents
against 24.72 at the highest point February 1,
and 18.15 a year ago. .The stagnant and hesi
tating condition of the goods market, though
not extending to the most favorite staples,
which are largely sold early ln the season, has
caused much irregularity In prices of goods of
other grades, so that some have been cleared
out , by concessions of 15 to 20 per cent from
the early quotations of the season. There is
also more complaint of ' cancellations, and on
this cccasion In cotton as well as woolen goods.
With prices adjusted to a lower range all tex
tile branches might have expected greater, ac
tivity. . ;< Â¦ Â¦ â¢Â¦'Â¦..Â¦.- >.C
. The change in hides has made . marked pro
gress also, the average at Chicago declining
over 3 per cent for the past week, and thus far
nhput 17 per cent from the highest point. Large
supplies' are mentioned In some grades, but the
weakness of the manufacture has been the con
trolling feature. â¢ . '^
Orders for . bocts \ and shoes have been â¢ re
duced , more than shipments," because many
works had orders which are not yet exhausted.
The shipments ln May have, been smaller than
In any other year since 1892. ; They were larger
by 17.4 per cent. In 1896, by 22.8 per cent In 1505
and by 27.7 per cent last year.
The decline in pigtron continues, gray I forge
reaching $18 50 at Pittsburg; No. 1 local coke
$22 at Chicago; No. 1 anthracite and Bessemer
$22 at Philadelphia: and Lehlgh No. 1 $22 here.
Only small changes have appeared during : the
week in . prices of finished products, t but these
are toward lower â¢ figures. ". There are current

NEW TORK, June 1.â Bradstreet's will say
to-morrow: Readjustments of price quotations
to meet the changed condition of supply and
demand are still the leading features of the
general trade. In volume the business doing
Is of a between-seasons character, improvement
ln some lines being counterbalanced by in
creased dullness in other branches. That the
basic conditions of the trade are ln the main
of a favorable nature, however, is proved by
the continued good railroad earning returns
which come to hand. The facts seem â¢ to be
that the volume of business offered the trans
portation interests of the country continues
considerably In excess of a year ago. . Crop
reports are relatively most favorable as re
gards corn and oats. In the Southwest wheat
crop prospects are still maintained at a high
average. In the Northwest wheat has been
helped by late rains, but owing to their 1 late
arrival it is not certain how much benefit
was obtained thereby. Most prices are lower
on the week, wheat noting a fractional drop
despite unfavorable French crop advices,
whence an enormous reduction in yield Is pre
dicted and also rather blue reports from the
Northwest early in the week, attended in some
respects by the rains mentioned. Pork pro
ducts have sympathized with the downward
tendency of values, aided thereby by increased
receipts of hogs. Some further liquidation has
been noted in cotton and the price has sunk
to 9c. In textiles the situation is rather de
pressed, although some improvement ln re
orders for dry goods is noted at leading Job
bing centers. Print cloths have been marked
down by the Fall River committee, but this
is a tardy recognition of hitherto known facts.
Manufacturers of woolen goods are out of the
market for raw wool and the outlook at pres
ent favors the lightweight woolens upon open-
Ing at lower values. Boots and shoes are dull
and a number of Eastern factories are short
of orders. The hand-to-mouth domestic de
mand for iron and steel continues, but the
number of small orders received Is taken to
indicate that consumers are practically bare
of stocks and any general shut-down for a
month's time, such as is supposed, might lead
to a scramble for supplies. Export business
continues good, though limited by the scarcity
of freight room. Southern pig iron and steel
rails not'nt; mest Inquiry. The situation in
the pipe market Is no better and plates are
also weaker. Concessions of fractions of a
dollar are apparently easily obtained for pig
Iron, but throughout the trade the feeling is
rather more cheerful, the feeling being that
lower prices will on the one hand encourage
consumptive demand and on the other hand
tend to restrict production by less economical
plants. * The settlement of the wage situation
this year might also be a possible source of
restriction of prdductlon.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4.533.140 bushels, against 3.63S,
86S bushels last week. 3.596,065 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1899, 5.21S.0S6 bushels in

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. June 1.â The stock market de
veloped an activity and strength to-day which
have been foreign to it for many weeks cast.
The dealings were to a large extent concen
trated in a limited number of stocks, but there
was nevertheless a broadening of the market
and erer.eral gains throughout, even In the less
active stocks. The Industrials and specialties
were emphatically relegated to the background
and with the exception of Sugar and the To
baccos there were no notable points of strength
or features of activity in that department.
It was a movement of railroad stocks decidedly
and the advance was made in the face of a
number of incidents which would have been
quickly seized upon by the bears in the lately
Â¦prevailing temper of speculation to force down
prices. To-day, on the contrary, the outstand
ing shorts were eager to cover their contracts,
and when they sought to secure stocks they
found a very limited amount offered, and the
resulting rise In prices was rapid and sharp.
It was reported in Wall street that a large
short account, amounting to over 20,000 shares
of various stocks, was being closed out pre
liminary to a European tour. The buying of
some individual stocks was attributed to opera
tions by a pool. The opening of the market
disclosed a mood of depression over the dis
appointing effect o( the war news on foreign
markets. Lundon sold about as many stocks in
this market as were bought for that account
yesterday and draRged prices below last nighrs
level. The steel stocks, after fractional ad
vances, turned heavy on the news of closing
down of additional mills and offered no sup
port to the market for the rest of the day.
Sugar hung below last night's prices all day..
In fact, the strength in the Tobacco stocks
was the only notable element of strength in
the industrial departments. A number of re
ports for April showed gains in the gross earn
ings, more than v.-ir>ed out by increased operat
ing expenses. But these reports were I Ignored
and caused no check to the upward tendency
In the railroad list. This found its Inception
In the grander group and spread to Union Pa
cific, the Atchisons and Missouri Pacirtc. It
was attributed to the favorable crop weather
prevailing In the West. Later In the day the
trunk lines came into prominence, led by Balti
more and Ohio, the common rising 4 and the
rreferred Â£U. The market closed active ana
strong at the bert.
There was a good absorption of railroad bonds
at advancing prices. Total sales, par valutr,
$1.4??. OCX
United States refunding 2's, when issued, de
clined ' t and old 4's advanced \i in the bid

Is an occasional variance In foreisn grades

SUmMRX OF THE MARKETS.
NEW YORK, June 1.â Bradstreet's Financial
Review will say to-morrow: Speculative deal
ings have aga^n been of a restricted kind and
the public appear to develop no real interest
In the. stock market. The investment demand
for bonds and dividend-paying stocks continues
to be excellent and It Is apparent that the
floating supply of auch securities is consider
ably smaller than In recent years. The de
velopments of the week have in the main been
of a favorable character. London has reopened
to the successful outcome of the war in South
Africa and the assurances that the gold mines
of the Rand are safe in an advance in which
I American stocks have participated to a cer
tain extent. The buying of our securities for
foreign account has .not, however, been on a
sufficiently large scale to have much practical
influence upon the tone of the market here or
upon current quotations for speculative shares.
Another development Is the decline of exchange
rates to a level which puts an end to any
apprehension as to shipments of gold. Early
this week it became apparent that no further
withdrawals 'of specie either from London or
Paris would be made and the situation in this
respect has shaped itself so that the gold
outflow is over for the season. Money is be
coming decidedly easier in London and the
other foreign I financial centers, open discount
at the British capital -being down to 2?i per
cent, a drop oÂ£ IV* per cent In a month. The
ease of money abroad with the cheerful news
from South Africa seems likely to result in
the development . of a speculative movement
In London of more than ordinary proportions,
although it must be admitted that thus far
the London etock market has taken the situa
tion quietly and docs not seem ' disposed . to
indulge In any overdrawn excitement. Another
circumstance which has had a considerable in-
Huence upon the femper of Wall street Is the
accumulating evidence that the so-called sugar
trade war is practically ended, even if there
has been no formal settlement among the re
fining interests. It has been pointed out for
Borne time that'lhe course of the capitalists in
; terested In the business was one which neces
sitated a compromise when all - parties were
thoroughly tired of their losses. It is certainly
remarkable that the American Sugar Refining
Company and the opposition refineries should
within the last few weeks have advanced prices
to a level which seejns to afford a fair profit
and the speculative public not unnaturally
draws the inference that this Is the result of
an agreement or arrangement among the
parties in Interest. While nothing can be
learned as to the facts there has been heavy
covering of shorts In Sugar stocks and an ad
vance In its price to 120. making it the most
active as well as the strongest feature of the
market. The steel stocks have been irregular
and heavy on the news that further reduc
tions in prices were scored in Western mar
kets. At the same time the liquidation in
these stocks seems to be over and in some
cases covering by a short Interest resulted in
an improvement of their market position. It
may also be said that the Tobacco stocks con
tributed the strength of the general
market because while they showed no decided
Improvement the selling in them has ceased
and the fear of competitive opposition has
diminished. .The railroad list has been strong
to steady, particular attention being paid to
Burlington, Northern Pacific common and
Atchison preferred. In the two latter cases
prospective increases in dividend rates are the
main reason for the support extended to them.
statements that ' some of the properties Just
taken by the Steel Sheet Company have been
sold back to former owners, and that Proper
ties of the Steel Hoop Company will be divid
ed likewise, but it is not at all surprising 11 Â»
few out of so many combinations result in tne
disappointment of some. Probably a ' owe J
quotation for Bessemer pig may be accepted
by the association in the central region ror
the latter half year, as the closing of many
works, owing" to reduced demand, may l e ,& ve
these furnaces without full employment. The
acceptance of two large contracts for export,
one for $100,000 by Southern works, is a good
sign.
Failures for the week have been 160 in the
United States against 143 last year and 21 in
Canada against 14 last year.

McGlade's defense occupied but a few
minutes during the afternoon. At the
opening of the-mornlng session C. S. Der
ham, T. B. McGlnnls, C. Rels and D. J.
Leary were called by the prosecution to
testify as to the peregrinations of a sal
ary warrant, many of which, it is alleged,
McGIade forged prior to Its reaching the
hands of the person making the demand
on the treasury. Charles True 'testified
that he saw "McGlade sign warrants
scheduled as Nos.- S6, S7 and SS, which it
is alleged were forged documents so far
as the name of the claimant for salary
was concerned. Charles J. Cody, detect
ive, and I. W. Lee.s, ex-Chief of Police,
were called to tell the story of McGlade's
arrest. The prosecution then â¢closed.
Attorney T. J. Lennon, who represents
the accused, immediately called his client
to the stand. McGIade briefly denied that
he had forged any documents. The cross
examination was just as brief, and as far
as the evidence went the jury was in
possession of the facts of the case.
Attorney Wise opened the argument for
the people, T. J. Lennon followed for the
defense and -Assistant District Attorney
Deuprey closed. The jury was charged,
and Just before 5 o'clock retired to delib
erate on a verdict.
Being unable to agree on a verdict the
Jury was locked up at 10:30 o'clock last
night. Judge Cook announced that unless
a verdict was reached at the time of the

NEW YORK, June l.-The Times to
morrow will publish the following:
In order to secure the passage of a bill
in Congress known as the "classification
bill" every postal clerk in New York, Chi
cago. Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pitts
burg and Baltimore was asked yesterday
(Friday) to give $10 out of the salary re
ceived for the month of May to be usod
in pushing the bill. New York City alone
has 1500 clerks and if all paid they would
contribute $15,000 to the fund, which is ex
pected to amount to at least $60,000. Tho
clerks were assured that the bill would
become a law by June 10 if the fund was
promptly raised.
It was the opposition of sonie of the
clerks to the payment of the sum de
manded which caused the disclosure of
the fact that such a fund was being
raised. According to Postmaster Van CÂ«Ut
this disclosure may cause the removal of
a number of men who have been actively

JOSEPH CAULFIELD and Michael
Tracy, two military convicts now
confined in a dungeon at â¢ Alcatraz
Island on a bread and water diet, have
just passed through an adventure of at
tempted escape full of desperate chances
and signalized by an utter disregard for
personal safety. That they did not perish
in the waters of the bay was due only to
the timely discovery of a guard and a

| This Is not the first attempt made by
; Caulfield and Tracy to escape paying the
I penalty imposed upon them for violation

At Nagasaki the two prisoners escaped
from the transport Mcade and "enjoyed"
a taste of freedom for six days. Half
clothed and half-fed they roamed about-

I the authorities and brought back to the

! nnd the attempt was abandoned.
1 The last unsuccessful venture occurred
I on the night of May 28. -The soldier pris-

Out on the dark waters of the bay the
two desperate men worked their way With

toward the city, but they got caught in
an eddying current and could make no
headway.
Drenched to the skin, their strength
spent by their arduous labors, they were
discovered by a guard at 4 a. m. just as
the day was dawning. At this time they
were floating hopelessly in the swirling
tide, and a few- shots from Guard Jor

the convicts to return to their island

CHICAGO. June 1.â The observations of
the sun's eclipse, taken after such elab
orate; preparations by the leading scien
tists of. two continents, are pronounced a
failure by Professor Crew of the North
western University. The great question
of the composition of th* sun will he little
nearer solution, says hn, as the result of
the work done at the many stations In tho
South. -"Whether it is a. solid enveloped in
gases, or whether it is all gaseous, or
whether " both, theories are wrong, must
remain just as open a question as It has
been for the. past hundred years.
It will not bo until 3918 that an oppor
tunity will be had in America to repeat
the . observations taken last Monday.
Many who took part in these expeditions
will be gone, and the disappointment,
says Professor Crew, is Intense. The ex
planation he gives for the failure is that
the instruments used were too powerful.
These, instead of giving valuable data, in
most cases left absolutely blank photo
graphic records. In thft seconds during
which the sun was totally eclipsed time
was too precious to trust to the human
eye, and all observations were photo
graphed. The development, of the photo
graphic plates, says Professor Crew, haa
oeen one series of disappointments, and
the work of years and months of prepara
tion is practically wasted."

SEATTLE,' June l.-W. C. Kurtz, for
merly .of San Francisco, and Norman R.
Smith, deputy land surveyor at Nome, are
the latest arrivals from Cape Nome, hav
ing reached â¢ Seattle .to-hight on the
steamer. Bertha. â¢ Mr.' Kurtz .and Mr.
Smith left Nome on March 16, with one
team of three dogs and as much provis
ions as they could carry. They traveled
on foot to the Kuskocrulm river, a dls
tance of 450 miles, which they reached on
April 10.. On that date the ice and snow
disappeared from the trail on all save the
higher elevations.
At the Kuskoquim the travelers gave
a Way their dog team and sled, and cast
off their surplus clothing. They deter
mined to find a short cut across the coun
try over rivets 'and mountain ranges to
the coast. _â¢ â¢
They figured on coming out on a point
opposite Kadiak Island. .Mr. Smith had
mapped out- a route traversing a hitherto
unknown country. The trip Involved all
kinds of hardship and suffering. The
Btory- from Nome brought by the two.
travelers contains facts more interesting
than any recent news received froftx the
new gold camp since the clcse of naviga
tion. Briefly, these are the facts related:
Between 1700 and 2000 miners were at
work along the beach at Nome, for a dis
tance of a dozen miles. The ground was
not frozen so as to prevent mining opera-?
tions, and the result has been that much
development work haa been done, with
prospects for an immense clean up when
the rivers melt In the spring. Prospecting
done in the tundra back of Nome shows
that there are two and three pay streaks
down to bedrock, at a depth of between
thirty and fifty feet.
The deepest pay streak so far has been
the richest; pans being found worth 62
cents. Mining men who have examined
these prospects predict that the tundra
will produce enormous quantities of sola
during the coming season.
A legal- snarl is to be unraveled this
summer by the lawyers reaching Cape
Nome. More than half the richest prop
erties on the beach and creek beds are
involved in litigation, due to the fact
that Jumpers have restaked the best
claims and have sold their alleged in
terests to Innocent, parties.
Probably the most important item of
news brought by Mr. Kurtz and Mr.
Smith relates to the mining operations on
the beach at Cape Nome and norths of.
that place. Mr. Kurtz said to The Call
correspondent to-night: â¢ ...
"There are about twelve miles of beach
claims, which were worked in a desultory
fashion last fall, and which will yield up
millions in gold during the coming sea
son. About four hundred miners win
tered on the beach, of which perhaps la
per cent ' worked continuously. March 1
the miners began striking their tents pre
paratory to the spring and summer work.
When we left Nome there were 1700 min
ers at. work on the beach.
"Between Cripple and Ranny rivers
good prospects were obtained before we
left, ranging from $3 to $7 per pan. The
miners as -a rule have no dittlculty in
working down to bedrock, from which
they drift, following the pay streak.
"Prospecting on the tundra has been
prosecuted to a considerable extent this
winter and usually with gratifying re
sults. Back of the North America
Trading and Transportation Company's
property a big hole was sunk -during the
winter to a depth of forty-seven feet.
Three separate and distinct pay slieaKS
were encountered. The first was four
Inches thick, and was found eight teet
below the grass roots. It averages 5 cents
to the pan.- The second pay streak was
found at a distance of aoout thiuy-tw'o
feet. The pans averaged 16 cents each.
It was at bedrock at a distance of forty
seven" feet that â¢ the â¢ richest pay streak
was found.- Here the pans went as high
as C2 cents. The gold was found in crov
ices in the bedrock. ; Some of those who
helped- sink the prospect hole declared
that this was a false bedrock .and that
greater values would be reached by sink
ing lower. This work was prosecuted be
tween January 15 and March .12. A steam
thawer was used to sink the prospect
hole.
"Near Anvil Mountain, three miles back
of Nome, Marshall Lee and J. A. King
sunk another prospect hole through the
tundra. They went down thirty feet aftd.
encountered pay v dirt running from 40
.cents to. 80 cents per pan."
Kurtz describes conditions in the camp
as promising with one exception, which is
that, owing to disputes over' titles to the
best claims in the district, and including
over half of the centrally located creek,
claim's, the work of development of the
camp will, he says, be put back nearly a
year. Two of the richest quartz strikes in
the history of the camp are reported by.
Kurtz.
The first find was made late in February
by a party headed . by a miner .named
Taylor. They left Nome guided by a na
tive, and traveled for two days into the
Interior in the direction of Port. Clarence.
Here they found a true ledge, from which
they took samples at random. These, be
ing assayed by Assayer Thomas of the
N A. T. and T. Company, gave returns
at $$00 in gold to the ton. The ore is said
to be plentiful in the new district, the
find being the richest jn the way of quartz
"discoveries in the history of the camp.
Another adventurous party of pros
pectors left Nome in the dead of winter
for the headwaters of the Ingelatulek
River, which Rises near the Unalaklik.
The prospectors were headed by two
miners named Jacobsen and Moon, and
the ore ran as high as $400 to the ton. In

Dewing married the daughter of the
late Dr. S. H. Melvln and moved in a
very exclusive social Bet in East Oak
land. He was an expert accountant and
had done experting for several promi
nent concerns with large Interests. He
was prominent in church and musical
circles and was referred to as a model of
business and personal propriety. His was
a case of infatuation for the races, and
his downfall is the old story of a man
of high standing and otherwise irre
proachable conduct being lured to ruin.
Dewing wa3 not known as a plunger,
but he was a constant attendant at the
track, and his thefts must have been
going on for a considerable period of.
time., for his shortage will amount to be
tween J15.U00 and S.-0.000. Hfe admits to
J15.0OO, and the experting of his books
will n6t be completed so that the actual
shortage will be known until to-morrow
night.
. As secretary of the Building and Loan
Association. Dewing had the receiving of
all money, though he was expected to
make deposits with the Central Bank
each day. But Dewing was such an ex
pert accountant' that he devised a system
of making his books balance, so that he
was able to steal more than $15,000 with
out being detected. His clever system of
hiding his" shortage was stretched to the
breaking point two weeks ago, when the
directors asked him to submit his report.
He pleaded the sickness of hia mother
in-law, the widow of the late Dr. Mel
vin, who was dying, and they gave him
time for that reason." Then a small dis
crepancy was discovered, and a special
meeting of the directors was hastily
called a week ago. and Mr. Dewing re
signed. An expert was put to work on
his books, and R. I. Mould of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company was
elected secretary.
No effort has been made to arrest
Dewing, and it is not likely that there
will be any prosecution. Either the
money will be paid back or a compromise
effected with the association. Every ef
fort has been made to hush up the story
of the shortage, owing: to Dewing's prom
inent connections in Oakland. He en-
Joyed the complete confidence of the di
rectors of the association. It is not likely
that he could have taken so much money
without discovery had he not had this.
' On the other hand, Dewing has made
no effort to escape, as he could easily
have done, for the directors have made
no effort to watch him. He la still at hia
East Oakland home. He admits that
there Is a shortage, but positively de
clines to discuss Ft in any way for the
press, upon the ground that he does not
wish to bring any more disgrace upon
his family than is absolutely necessary.
The discovery that A. A. I>ewing, sec
retary of the People's Building and Loan
Association, was short in his accounts
with the association was a great sur
prise to those who know him and are
familiar with his relations and social
standing. The fact that he lost the money
at the races is still more surprising, for
Dewing has hardly been suspected of
plunging on the ponies save by a few
who have seen him at the track on rare
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.

VETERANS TO PAY MORE
HONOR TO THE OLD FLAG
report is true it will have no effect on the
war, which will be carried on with un
abated vigor. They say General Mas
cado. will probably succeed Agutnaldo.
The only other likely candidate is General
Pio del Pilar, a brother of General Gre
gorio del Pilar. who. was killed in the
lijrhtm? in North I^uzon some months ago
The Filipinos admit the possibility , of
strife over the election of a .successor to
Agujnaldo, as the Tagals of education and
those of Spanish leanings are. divided
Each party wants to govern the country
and this may lead to dissensions.

Myer Brothers Compromise Their Dif
ferences With the Men and Boy
'S - cott Is Removed.
The difficulty which has existed for sev
eral months between the labor unions and
Meyer Brothers has at last been amicably
adjusted. A compromise was signed on
Mav 20 and the boycott against the firm
rernoved. The union clonkmakers are jubi
1 lanf more especially as M. Friedman has
also withdrawn his orders from the house
of M. Slmonoff pending a settlement .of
the trouble between that firm and the
labor unions. v
The boycott on the shoe firm of O. M.
Kutz & Co. Â¦ has .warmed up sufficiently to
throw the case into court, where the right
of a labor union to issue and maintain a
picket notifying the public not to patron
ize an unfair house will be tested. The
Labor Council has promised to stand by
Secretary Rosenberg in his fight. Hence
forth all boots and shops made by union
shops will- carry the union stamp.
At a meeting of the Journeymen Plas
terers held at 927 Market street last night

secretary. The unanimous sense of the

minutes during the afternoon. At the
opening of the-mornlng session C. S. Der

Leary were called by the prosecution to
testify as to the peregrinations of a sal
ary warrant, many of which, it is alleged,
McGIade forged prior to Its reaching the
hands of the person making the demand
on the treasury. Charles True 'testified
that he saw "McGlade sign warrants
scheduled as Nos.- S6, S7 and SS, which it
is alleged were forged documents so far
as the name of the claimant for salary
was concerned. Charles J. Cody, detect

were called to tell the story of McGlade's
arrest. The prosecution then â¢closed.
Attorney T. J. Lennon, who represents
the accused, immediately called his client
to the stand. McGIade briefly denied that
he had forged any documents. The cross
examination was just as brief, and as far
as the evidence went the jury was in
possession of the facts of the case.

In order to secure the passage of a bill
in Congress known as the "classification
bill" every postal clerk in New York, Chi
cago. Philadelphia, San Francisco, Pitts

has 1500 clerks and if all paid they would
contribute $15,000 to the fund, which is ex
pected to amount to at least $60,000. Tho
clerks were assured that the bill would
become a law by June 10 if the fund was
promptly raised.
It was the opposition of sonie of the
clerks to the payment of the sum de
manded which caused the disclosure of
the fact that such a fund was being
raised. According to Postmaster Van CÂ«Ut
this disclosure may cause the removal of

At Nagasaki the two prisoners escaped

Drenched to the skin, their strength

discovered by a guard at 4 a. m. just as
the day was dawning. At this time they
were floating hopelessly in the swirling

CHICAGO. June 1.â The observations of

failure by Professor Crew of the North

of the composition of th* sun will he little

the work done at the many stations In tho
South. -"Whether it is a. solid enveloped in
gases, or whether it is all gaseous, or
whether " both, theories are wrong, must
remain just as open a question as It has
been for the. past hundred years.
It will not bo until 3918 that an oppor
tunity will be had in America to repeat
the . observations taken last Monday.
Many who took part in these expeditions
will be gone, and the disappointment,
says Professor Crew, is Intense. The ex
planation he gives for the failure is that
the instruments used were too powerful.
These, instead of giving valuable data, in
most cases left absolutely blank photo
graphic records. In thft seconds during
which the sun was totally eclipsed time
was too precious to trust to the human
eye, and all observations were photo

the work of years and months of prepara

merly .of San Francisco, and Norman R.
Smith, deputy land surveyor at Nome, are
the latest arrivals from Cape Nome, hav
ing reached â¢ Seattle .to-hight on the
steamer. Bertha. â¢ Mr.' Kurtz .and Mr.
Smith left Nome on March 16, with one
team of three dogs and as much provis
ions as they could carry. They traveled
on foot to the Kuskocrulm river, a dls
tance of 450 miles, which they reached on
April 10.. On that date the ice and snow
disappeared from the trail on all save the
higher elevations.
At the Kuskoquim the travelers gave
a Way their dog team and sled, and cast
off their surplus clothing. They deter
mined to find a short cut across the coun
try over rivets 'and mountain ranges to
the coast. _â¢ â¢
They figured on coming out on a point
opposite Kadiak Island. .Mr. Smith had
mapped out- a route traversing a hitherto
unknown country. The trip Involved all
kinds of hardship and suffering. The
Btory- from Nome brought by the two.
travelers contains facts more interesting
than any recent news received froftx the
new gold camp since the clcse of naviga
tion. Briefly, these are the facts related:
Between 1700 and 2000 miners were at
work along the beach at Nome, for a dis
tance of a dozen miles. The ground was
not frozen so as to prevent mining opera-?
tions, and the result has been that much
development work haa been done, with
prospects for an immense clean up when
the rivers melt In the spring. Prospecting
done in the tundra back of Nome shows
that there are two and three pay streaks
down to bedrock, at a depth of between
thirty and fifty feet.
The deepest pay streak so far has been
the richest; pans being found worth 62
cents. Mining men who have examined
these prospects predict that the tundra
will produce enormous quantities of sola
during the coming season.
A legal- snarl is to be unraveled this
summer by the lawyers reaching Cape
Nome. More than half the richest prop
erties on the beach and creek beds are
involved in litigation, due to the fact
that Jumpers have restaked the best
claims and have sold their alleged in
terests to Innocent, parties.
Probably the most important item of
news brought by Mr. Kurtz and Mr.
Smith relates to the mining operations on
the beach at Cape Nome and norths of.
that place. Mr. Kurtz said to The Call
correspondent to-night: â¢ ...
"There are about twelve miles of beach
claims, which were worked in a desultory
fashion last fall, and which will yield up
millions in gold during the coming sea
son. About four hundred miners win
tered on the beach, of which perhaps la
per cent ' worked continuously. March 1
the miners began striking their tents pre
paratory to the spring and summer work.
When we left Nome there were 1700 min
ers at. work on the beach.
"Between Cripple and Ranny rivers
good prospects were obtained before we
left, ranging from $3 to $7 per pan. The
miners as -a rule have no dittlculty in
working down to bedrock, from which
they drift, following the pay streak.
"Prospecting on the tundra has been
prosecuted to a considerable extent this
winter and usually with gratifying re
sults. Back of the North America
Trading and Transportation Company's
property a big hole was sunk -during the
winter to a depth of forty-seven feet.
Three separate and distinct pay slieaKS
were encountered. The first was four
Inches thick, and was found eight teet
below the grass roots. It averages 5 cents
to the pan.- The second pay streak was
found at a distance of aoout thiuy-tw'o
feet. The pans averaged 16 cents each.
It was at bedrock at a distance of forty
seven" feet that â¢ the â¢ richest pay streak
was found.- Here the pans went as high
as C2 cents. The gold was found in crov
ices in the bedrock. ; Some of those who
helped- sink the prospect hole declared
that this was a false bedrock .and that
greater values would be reached by sink
ing lower. This work was prosecuted be
tween January 15 and March .12. A steam
thawer was used to sink the prospect
hole.
"Near Anvil Mountain, three miles back
of Nome, Marshall Lee and J. A. King
sunk another prospect hole through the
tundra. They went down thirty feet aftd.
encountered pay v dirt running from 40
.cents to. 80 cents per pan."
Kurtz describes conditions in the camp
as promising with one exception, which is
that, owing to disputes over' titles to the
best claims in the district, and including
over half of the centrally located creek,
claim's, the work of development of the
camp will, he says, be put back nearly a
year. Two of the richest quartz strikes in
the history of the camp are reported by.
Kurtz.
The first find was made late in February
by a party headed . by a miner .named
Taylor. They left Nome guided by a na
tive, and traveled for two days into the
Interior in the direction of Port. Clarence.
Here they found a true ledge, from which
they took samples at random. These, be
ing assayed by Assayer Thomas of the
N A. T. and T. Company, gave returns
at $$00 in gold to the ton. The ore is said
to be plentiful in the new district, the
find being the richest jn the way of quartz
"discoveries in the history of the camp.
Another adventurous party of pros
pectors left Nome in the dead of winter
for the headwaters of the Ingelatulek
River, which Rises near the Unalaklik.
The prospectors were headed by two
miners named Jacobsen and Moon, and
the ore ran as high as $400 to the ton. In
vestigations prosecuted by skilled miners
on the beach have revealed the existence
of what is- called a ruby sand, which,
while not profitable to work by the old
rocker, can nevertheless be handled by
large corporations with Improved machin
ery and big pay derived. This ruby sand,
it Is said, extends along the whole length
of tho coast to* Cape York. The mining
companies equipped with machinery are
nrenaring to handle this strata of sand,
which It is said- pays from $10 to $36 per
ton.

Dewing married the daughter of the
late Dr. S. H. Melvln and moved in a
very exclusive social Bet in East Oak
land. He was an expert accountant and
had done experting for several promi
nent concerns with large Interests. He
was prominent in church and musical
circles and was referred to as a model of
business and personal propriety. His was
a case of infatuation for the races, and
his downfall is the old story of a man
of high standing and otherwise irre
proachable conduct being lured to ruin.
Dewing wa3 not known as a plunger,
but he was a constant attendant at the
track, and his thefts must have been
going on for a considerable period of.
time., for his shortage will amount to be
tween J15.U00 and S.-0.000. Hfe admits to
J15.0OO, and the experting of his books
will n6t be completed so that the actual
shortage will be known until to-morrow
night.
. As secretary of the Building and Loan
Association. Dewing had the receiving of
all money, though he was expected to
make deposits with the Central Bank
each day. But Dewing was such an ex
pert accountant' that he devised a system
of making his books balance, so that he
was able to steal more than $15,000 with
out being detected. His clever system of
hiding his" shortage was stretched to the
breaking point two weeks ago, when the
directors asked him to submit his report.
He pleaded the sickness of hia mother
in-law, the widow of the late Dr. Mel
vin, who was dying, and they gave him
time for that reason." Then a small dis
crepancy was discovered, and a special
meeting of the directors was hastily
called a week ago. and Mr. Dewing re
signed. An expert was put to work on
his books, and R. I. Mould of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company was
elected secretary.
No effort has been made to arrest
Dewing, and it is not likely that there
will be any prosecution. Either the
money will be paid back or a compromise
effected with the association. Every ef
fort has been made to hush up the story
of the shortage, owing: to Dewing's prom
inent connections in Oakland. He en-
Joyed the complete confidence of the di
rectors of the association. It is not likely
that he could have taken so much money
without discovery had he not had this.
' On the other hand, Dewing has made
no effort to escape, as he could easily
have done, for the directors have made
no effort to watch him. He la still at hia
East Oakland home. He admits that
there Is a shortage, but positively de
clines to discuss Ft in any way for the
press, upon the ground that he does not
wish to bring any more disgrace upon
his family than is absolutely necessary.
The discovery that A. A. I>ewing, sec
retary of the People's Building and Loan
Association, was short in his accounts
with the association was a great sur
prise to those who know him and are
familiar with his relations and social
standing. The fact that he lost the money
at the races is still more surprising, for
Dewing has hardly been suspected of
plunging on the ponies save by a few
who have seen him at the track on rare

VETERANS TO PAY MORE
HONOR TO THE OLD FLAG
report is true it will have no effect on the
war, which will be carried on with un
abated vigor. They say General Mas
cado. will probably succeed Agutnaldo.
The only other likely candidate is General
Pio del Pilar, a brother of General Gre
gorio del Pilar. who. was killed in the
lijrhtm? in North I^uzon some months ago
The Filipinos admit the possibility , of
strife over the election of a .successor to
Agujnaldo, as the Tagals of education and
those of Spanish leanings are. divided
Each party wants to govern the country
and this may lead to dissensions.

APIA, Samoa. Slay 1.â In Tutuila the
American representative, in tho person of
Commander Tilly of the United States
steamship Aberanda, has had a much
more agreeable and- pleasant experience
than Dr. Â¦ Solf , the German representative
at Apia. The natives hailed with enthu-
Elasm the hoisting, of "Old Glory," and of
their own volitfon presented to the mili
tary commander a formal deed of cession,
at the same time assuring . him . of their
joy at coming under the shadow of the
Stars and Stripes.
.At Manu'a, the island lying east of Tutu-
Ila. the chiefs have requested Commander
Tilly to visit the islajid in person and
there hoist the flag. This he consented to
do, and the date fixed for the function
was the 17th of May, but at the time of
writing there Is no news from that place.
Customs regulations have been promul
gated :by the commandant. The only port
of entry in Tutulla Is Pagor Pago. The du
ties are the same as formerly collected
under the Berlin treaty, with the one ex
ception that the export duty on copra has
been abolished. Lands are not to be alien
ated by the natives, although lands may
be leased for a period not exceeding forty
years, with the approval of the command
ant. The natives will be governed in dls-:
trlcts. There are three districts, each un
der a chief. - : Â¦
' Under the chiefs are the judges *nd vil
lage magistrates, and an appeal lies from
all to the commandant; ' â¢
The importation of arms and ammuni
tion is strictly prohibited. In the form
ing and 'promulgation of these laws the
commandant has been aided by E. W.
Gurr, formerly of Apia, solicitor and one
of the attorneys for Malietoa fn the late
kingship trial. He has been appointed
Secretary for Nati\*e Affairs, and this ap
pointment is popular with the natives,
.who are very pleased with the command
ant: for such a choice. As the whole of
Tutulla was formerly on the side of Malie
toa there are no factious differences to
reconcile, and all Tutuila is now a happy
and contented group of islands.
Customs Regulations arid Duties Are
Very Similar to Those in Force
Under the . Berlin
Treaty. Â¦
AMERICAN FLAG
IS WELCOMED
IN TUTUILA
Natives Voluntarily Pre
sent Commander Tilly
With Cession Deed.

Inspector at Tacoma, Wash., In a tele
gram to Commissioner General Pqwderly
to-day, states that two steamers have
arrived at Victoria, B. C, within the
last two days with 900 Japanese immi
grants destined for the United i States,
presumably to' avoid possible deportation.
T.he Inspection of the arrivals by the
steamship Â¦ Glenogle had been completed,
with the result that fifty Japanese immi
grants were -ordered deported.
â¢ In the course of a letter received by
Mr. Powderly, Mr. Watchorn says that
"public sentiment in Tacoma is strongly
against the so-called 'invasion' of Jap
anese, and by public meetings, newspa
per criticism and discussions in the meet-
Ings, of worklngmen's unions an anti-Jap
anese sentiment is being cultivated very
thoroughly, and all political conventions
(without regard to party) recently held on
this coast and in adjacent States have
vigorously declared in favor of restrict
ing or prohibiting Janapese immigration."
In discussing this matter in a subse
quent letter Mr. Watchorn says: Â¦
"Despite the general public â¢ outcry
against this so-called Invasion of Jap
anese, 1 am: quite unable to Identify my
self with the publicly expressed senti
ment that it is- an unmixed evil. The
cleanliness of . the average Japanese im
migrant, tho. abundance' and condition, of
wearing apparel, the amount of cash he
possesses, the diversified Industries they
present,, their. numerous and widely sep
arate^ destinations, . Uieir health and
youth'fulness, all. tend, in my opinion, to
deprive the so-called influx of much mis-
Considered da-nger tp the peace and wel
fare of society. Nevertheless it Is quite
apparent i-iat there Is someunlawful im
migration being conducted as a purely
commercial enterprise."
Inspector W^tchorn, in Commenting
on the Immigrants, Says the
" Brown Men Impressed Him
Very Favorably.
Round- About Way Taken
to Avoid Possible
Deportation.

taking the world Into his confidence. He
went around the palace yesterday treating
all his friends indiscriminately, and to
each and every one telling his secret and
showing the cable tips he has received
from the charming Lady Bowyer.
Â¦ ' A* cable message from Lady Bowyer
conveyed to Johnstone the first informa
tion of the delicious notoriety in store for
him. Her ladyship, did not trifle with
words. Her message ! , was succinct and
pithy. ,.
"Sir George about. to bring suit for di
vorce," she Bald. "You named as co
respondent." \ .' /
. This cheering intelligence sent John
stone off to gather up his friends and bid
them celebrate*at his expense.
Johnstone is authority for the state
ment, that since he pocketed that cable
message life has been one- continuous
smile and 'he has been enjoying one con
tinuous Vjag."
; . The man whom . Sir George would hold
responsible for ' disturbing his marital
felicity is the intimate friend of the Duke
of .Manchester, whom he accompanied to
America last November when his Grace
came over to try his hand in 1 * American
journalism. Johnstone himself hasVno
handle to his name, but he has a cousin
.who is. a marquis and his friends are
dukes and counts and things. Ho Is a nice
appearing youth with a heavy pocket and
a' glib tongue, j and i he speaks of his ad
;venture' in a ' little knowing '. way, - accom
panied with: " an Insinuating ; smile- tha t ;
says:; '."Oh! I'm; a regular devil, I am."
Johnstone was, not averse to discussing
the Bowyers. . â¢
; -"Oh ! I say," said the Duke of . Man
chester's friend. - "Bowyer must be crazy."
He- can't -prove ..anything, ilicame over
with his Grace In November and returned
to England shortly after. Then I came
again m February, and so did Lady Bow
yer. When I got to New York I put up
at - the Savoy and â¢ Lady Bowyer stopped
at : the Waldorf-Astoria.* In the face of
that how is . Sir George going to prove
anything?"
Whatever Sir , George will attempt to
prove Johnstone will be on the spot to re
fute. .: Before. the cabK* , for; Lady : Bowyer.
camerJohnstone'was getting ready , to go
to Nome. He, had s his ticket, shad bought
some 'claims in the. land of gold and had
made all * the j necessary preparations < to
sail Â¦ to-day on > the San - Jose. - Thursday
he received the cablegram from her. lady-
ship and yesterday he abandoned his pro
posed trip and was trying to arrange to
get a special train that would fly with
him Eastward so he might make the
Kaiser Wilhelm. which sails on Tuesday.
"I must get right back to London," he
explained, "to defend the lady. And then
there is my family. I must consider them,
too. I come from an old Scotch family
and have connections all over England.
When I return I shall stop with my cou
sin, the Marquis of Anglesey."
According to Johnstone 'the lady whose
name has been connected with his does
not move in the same set ashe does. > *
"Hers Is a good set," he said, "but not
my set. SlrGeorge Is a racing man. I move
nearly altogether in diplomatic circles.
Lady. Bowyer is beautiful," Johnstone
went on to say. "She has brown hair, blue
eyes and a fair skin. In fact, she looks
enough like me to be taken for my sis
ter." jyaagqjfeptffiiÂ»a*f */Â¦ .
In spite of the fact that Johnstone de
clares Sir George has not the slightest
ground for his actions, he admits that
Lady Bowyer has written to him and that
he has those same letters in his posses
sion. "But they are just such letters as
a : friend might write," ' he says, "and, in
fact, I have often reproached Ethel. Lady
Bowyer, for writing such very cold epis
tles."
Johnstone has been here but a few days,
and declares that he finds this to be "a
very hot town." As he reviewed his
harmless relationship with the wife of
Sir â¢ George, ; whom he ' had- seen much of
in Paris, In London, and during tho mem
orable ocean voyage, he grew comldeminl
android the 'interviewer many, bits of
personal history.
"I am 21 years old," he confided, "r
dropped ; three nickels in the slot this
morning and find I weigh 176 pounds. I've,
had a terrible Jag on since I got that
cablegram. The funny part about me Is.

to bed perfectly sober and wake up with
such a jag on. This is the first time I have
been interviewed In San Francisco. When
I got to New York with Manchester there

than 4 Manchester. Town Topics, however,
had something to say about me and gave
me a ; beautiful roast. In New Orleans I
was Interviewed personally and got a col
umn and a half send-off. ".
There. Is only one thing that makes
Johnstone unhappy just at present, and
that is that his man servant' left him in
New Orleans.
."If, I only had my man to bathe me and
put me In my good clothes you couhl see

CENSUS TAKING
HAS NOW BEGUN
Mr. Magee calls attention to the fact
that deeds have not been placed* on record
and accounts for that fact as follows:
"One of two explanations is that either
the money has been paid and the deeds
kept off record, or what Is not only more
likely but' Indeed practically certain 1s
that time was taken by placing the deeds
in escrow, to acquire other possessions
without hunting ducks with .the brass
band of noise and publicity of recording
at the City Hall."
Speaking of the Lloyd purchases Mr.
Magee says: "It was given out as each
one of these purchases was recorded that
it was made by an Eastern capitalist who
believed in the future of San Francisco
The Eastern capitalist in this case is tha
photograph of C. P. Huntington."
Mr. Magee reasons that Mr. Huntlneton
is preparing to "box in the Santa Fe' ? - to
compete with Jim Hill of the Great North
ern and also the. Canadian Pacific which
are sure to come to San Francisco In
conclusion he, says-: "The city has entered
upon paths of growth and progress to
which there can be hereafter no perma
nent retrogression."
"In all the interviews between C. P.
Huntington and the newspapers he ha3
denied that he, personally or tor the
Southern Pacific Company, had lately
bought any land south of Market and
near the water front. But he ha3 not yet
denied that he bought property there for
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
The block bought ostensibly by J. P.
Lloyd, and bounded by Fremont. First.
Brannan and Bryant, was paid for by the
Pacific Mail and it was purchased for that
company's use. But the Pacific Mall is
personified by Mr. Huntington.
"The Southern Pacific purchases on Kol
som street have been made for freight
depots and for yards to connect with rails
now on Townsend street. A solid strip
has not yet been purchased, because some
owners ask too much for their .property;
but a railroad knows that, in condemna
tion sultb, the greatest ownership carries
with it the least resistance. In Mr. Hunt
lngton's denials he has -kept within the
bounds of veracity. Â¦ Anything but a de
nial by him would be costly, very costly.
Indeed, if any more purchases are to be
made, for with the knowledge that he is
in the field up will go prices."
Thomas Magee has written . an article
in which he sets forth' the purpose of C,
P. Huntingdon in making extensive pur
chases of real estate near the water, front
in the factory district, the news of which
was published exclusively in The Call.

HAND OF COLLIS
IN LAND DEALS,
SAYS MR. MAGEE
In Memory of Judge Levy.
The various departments of the Superior
Court adjourned early yesterday in re
spect to the memory ot the lata Judge
Walter H. Levy.
States Commissioner was without Juris
diction.
Max Popper, Iro
Â¦ quois Brave,
Who Was As
, sailed by the
' Supervisor, Re
taliates.
â¢ i â
Popper said he had to pay the Super
visors $650 a month or he could not keep
the contract. He mentioned the fact that
he could not get the contract otherwise
as justification for the payment of the
money. And at that very time there were
miles and miles of streets which under the
contract should be swept and for which
Popper was being paid that never saw one
of his sweeping machines.
"It was also well known that during all
this time Popper was a rabid anti-Buckley
man and that he lost no opportunity to
denounce Buckleyism and bossism, but
that while he was doing all this talking
he had Buckley for his partner in the
sweeping contract. The contract was in
his own name, but Buckley was a full
partner.
"It is because of this record that I
wished to have Popper prevented from
speaking before the Supervisors last even
ing. A confessed briber of Supervisors
has no right even to be present at their
deliberations. Besides, I detest political
hypocrisy and I will denounce it whenever
I find it. Popper's presence in the party is
the means of driving good men away from
it, and I do not think the man should be
allowed to identify himself with it in any
way. His presence should, not be toler
ated."
Braves Congratulate Popper.
Max Popper was the center of a con
gratulatory throng at the wigwam of the
Iroquois last night. The braves mingled
their terms of Â¦ commendation for his
course with execrations for his enemy.
"I saw you last night," said a warrior,
"and I felt like givin' the big duffer a
clout in the neck."
The Call reporter present 'was impor
tuned by the braves to publish Reed's po
litical record. Popper seemed to be the
least agitated of the warrlor3. When he
was asked what motives induced Reed to
take' the warpath Popper replied:
"The Iroquois Club opposed him- in con
vention when he was seeking nomination
for the office of District Attorney. He.
was opposed on the ground that' he was
â¢uot a Democrat. â¢ There was no personal
motive in the opposition. The first time I
met Reed was in 1S92, when I was chair
man of the Democratic committee. Gar
rett McEnerney brought him to headquar
ters and introduced him as a young Yolo
convert from the Republican . party who
had graduated with- honors at the State
University. A desire was expressed that
the young orator should be given an op
portunity to address Democratic meetings
I in small towns.
Reed Sent to Pigeon Point. .
"Reed -rras sent out to expound Demo
cratic principles at Pigeon Point and Half
moon Bay. We. never heard any objec
tions to his oratory. When the campaign
closed he became a candidate for the of
fice of Prosecuting Attorney of the Police
Couit. The Supervisors objected to his
selection on the ground that they had
never heard of him. At his request I gave
him a letter stating that he had made
campaign speeches for the party, and he
got the place.
"In 1S'J4 Reed was a member of the Iro
â¢juols Club. He went to the convention
that' year, pledged to support William M.
Hinton for Railroad Commissioner, and
voted for Dr. Stanton. In 1896 he was a
Ralneyite In the Odd Fellows' Hall con
vention. He was a candidate for Super
visor, but E. P. E. Troy opposed. him on
the ground that he was Rainey's messen
ger." /
â¢At this stage of the Interview Mr. Troy
declared himself by saying: "I told Phe
lan that Reed -was not a. fit man for Super
visorâthat he was the daily associate of
Sam Rainey and was. in fact, Rainey's
messenger in the convention."
Many of the braves, among them Max
Popper, acknowledged last night that they
voted for Reed for Supervisor at the last
election. Others declared that they did
not and never would vote for a "gold
bug." It was asserted that Reed and oth
ers who voted against Bryan In 1S96 were
compelled to resign from the club.
Animosities pf
the Late Politi-;
cal Campaign
Openly Revived
by Charles W.
tvppn
PARKMAIC, the historian. ' relates
that nothing was more appalling to
the early settlers on the beautiful
St. Lawrence ; River then the mid
night cry cf "The IroquolsV The blood
thirsty tribes composing this nation have
passed away from the world's stage and
their legends of etrife are converted into
political campaign -.; lessons.
The braves of the San Francisco Iro
quois t&krs fiendish delight In the exhi
bition of a political scalp. Just Â£S the an*
cient Iroquols delighted at the sight of the
fresh ami bleeding trophy of a midnight:
massacre. When .Max Popper goes Into :
the council hall in "Pythian C?.=tie with
the political scalp : of a Balnejr warrior
attached to his belt .the braves dance and
eing. Plaudits to the prowrss of Max
are chanted. Long time did Max. the
brave yearn for the pcaJp of Charles Wes
ley P.eed. who was accounted one of the
most faring and intrepid of Chief Raln
ey's camp. Many moons of yearning- went
by before Pepper saw his opportunity to>
flash, the scalping kcife.; The â¢ time
come, however, .; and it ';. came In!
this way: Reed had long- coveted the 1
fat job of District Attorney for the city
of San Francisco, When the conditions
,were favorable for seizing the position
lleed went before. ' the : ;eonvention of
Democrats to solicit the prize. To his
amazement Popper -qf. the Iroquois, : fierce
and savage, sprang: into the midst of the
council and uttering the war whoop ot
*"6 to 1" proclaimed that Reed was
false to Bryan and a. traitor in the'.'DexnoW Â¦
cratic camp. The; attack. Â¦ produced . a ;:
great sensation in the Democratic con
vention. Delegates on all sides repeated
the cries of the Iroquois. Â¦â¢ There arose
, f uch a storm of. ecstv protest that the
honored name of Reed was hirsed without
cessation for full twenty minutes. When
, the convention registered its choice of a
candidate Reed's jiarpe was found away
down in the list of elain. . The Reed
scalp was taken and borne aloft in the
village of the Iroqiiois.
AJiother office â that of ; Supervisorâ was
given to Â¦\VeFley Reed and in a short
ppace of time, the scalp wound healed. Of
ficial salve is a potent remedy for sore
and wounded Democrats and Reed rapidi
ly recovered uncer. the . Supervisorial
anointment; Many of the politi'cans in
the Democratic camp, and notably sev
eral who hold exalted positions in the
"cabinet." aver that Reed has ever been
true and faithful to the cardinal Jeffer
sonian principles of pure and undiluted
Democracy. It is confessed that he did
revolt against Bryan, holdine that Palmer
and Buckner were true champions of
Democracy in the campaign which cul
minated in the triumph of William Mc-
Kinley. Max Popper contended that
Keed voted for McKinley. The "cabinet"
resolved that Heed voted for PalmeT and
Buckner. To settle the dispute the vigi
lant Popper went to the records and de
clared he had ascertained that no vote -for
Palmer and Buckner was cost in thÂ°
firecinct wherein Reed, did dwell. The
roquols drew the inference that Reed
voted for McKinley. Wiser men reached
the conclusion that Reed voted for Palmer
and Buckner and that the Iroquois count
ed the vote for Bryan. When the qeus- '
tion was rereferred to the cabirtet Jim
O'Brien went forth and dug- up three
votes for Palmer and Buckner In Reed's
precinct. . . â¢
Charles Wesley After Max.
"When Reed pot well of his wounds he
began to nurse a scheme of venpear.ee.
On the warpath he is a match for the
proudest brave of the Iroquois. There
was no such word as fear In his Yolo
County lexicon. His record at the State
Â¦University is pointed to with pride. In
single-handed combat, so his friends aver,
Charles Wesley Reed, Gold Bug, and Max Popper, Silverite, on the Warpath.
he could sweep the streets : wlth Popper.
But that is neither here nor there. Reed
was not looking for a contract- to dust
the streets. HÂ« longed to meet his arch
enemy in a public place and administer
a public rebuke. Thursday night at the
meeting of the Board of Supervisors his
chance came and he did not neglect â¢ to
f-mbrace it. Since the. campaign of last
fall Max Popper had been a good Indian.
He buried his tomahawk and sheathed his
scalping knife immediately after. the elec
tion. Hence he was not looking for war
when he entered the arena as the mission
ary of the Federated Improvement Clubs.
When he arose to speak Reed also arose
in the double role of avenger and Super
visor. Then high . and hot . words were
hurled at Pepper of the Iroqupis. Reed,
pointing at. his enemy, exclaimed:
"He made his money by bribing mem
bers of a former Board of Supervisors.
He went before a Grand Jury on the sub
ject and declined to testify .on' the ground
that his testimony .would convict himself
of a felony." ......
Before the enraged Reed could finish the
sentence Mayor Phelan, the blessed peace
maker,, uttered these words:
"I suppose every member of this board
is responsible .lor his words."
. Reed instantly issued an oral proclama
tion of responsibility. Reed insisted fur
ther that Popper should not be heard, but
he was not openly sustained by a single
associate. Perhaps curiosity to hear from
a man who was accused of giving bribe3
to Supervisors Impelled them to listen.
But Reed listened not. He wrapped about
him his robes of independence and strode
from the council lire. His enemy, â¢Â¦ un
daunted by the attack, regretted his de
parture. "When the Mayor sought to apol
ogize the .spirit of the old Iroquois nerved
Popper to exclaim that .he was able to
take care of himself. Popper should bear
in mind that history repeats itself, and
history tells that the Iroquois were almost
annihilated and effectually subdued.: In
the process of subjugation many a noble
fighter fell, and Reed should not forget
this fact.
It may seem strange to the reader, "yet
it is true, that Phelan is not the inward
friend of Popper that the open apology
suggests. There lurks in the bosom of the
Mayor hatred for the Iroquois. and all
other stalwart championa of Bryan and
free silver. In the convention last fall
Phelan was an active agent In excluding
resolutions indorsing the Chicago plat
form.
In speaking of the episode Supervisor
Reed last, evening said:
"I have been opposing Mr. Popper for a
long time, and it was last night that I
had my first .opportunity to speak my
mind. about him in public. I do not be
lieve he is a fit man to be in the. party,
and I think his presence in it and his tol
eration by i the party leaders are obstacles
to Democratic success.-
"It is well known that Popper has ad
mitted he bribed the Board of Supervisors
to get his street sweeping contracts
through. He admitted it to me in the
rooms of the Iroquois Club. There were
several gentlemen together, and to them
