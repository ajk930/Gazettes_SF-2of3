JAPAN PLACES LIVE TORPEDOES
AT THE MOUTHS OF HER HARBORS
i^T ALL HEADQUABTEES, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, May 25.-InformatIon has
ly been received here from reliable sources which shows that Japan has taken rather peculiar action
in connection with the naval maneuvers in which her fleet is now engaged. It Is customary to
place "dummy" torpedoes at mouths of harbors which are included in the plan of defense, but information
given me to-day shows that live torpedoes instead have been planted. This fact has aroused consider
able comment in naval circles, and has been accepted as an indication of preparations for war. 'Â¦
In diplomatic circles, however, a different . impression prevails. A. well; known . diplomat, who
has just returned from Japan, said to-day that financially the Japanese Government was not in condi
tion to go to war, although he stated. that it undoubtedly was true that the Japanese people wereIwill
ing and anxious to go. to war with Russia, giving as an indication of their eagerness the effect of the re
port circulated for stock Jobbing purposes, the announcement that a Russian man-of-war had fired upon
a Japanese merchant steamer, as a result of which Japan was immediately in arms, the excitement disap
pearing 1 only when the alleged occurrence was officially denied.
The Russian Government is said to be pursuing a very _ correct attitude in the East at this time.
It does net want war with Japan, and its representatives in Japan and Korea are under instructions to
pursue a most pacific policy. The Masampho dispute has been amicably arranged, and it is reiterated that
there are at present no controversies between the two governments. _'.-

CHICAGO, May -25. â Application - for divorce by Mrs. Bertha Stecker from Professor
Heniy , T. Stecker, instructor in mathematics, in the Northwestern University, has
. out tacts that would startle a community it> the most heathen country in the
world. According to the evidence of close friends of Mrs. Stecker and admissions of members
of the faculty/Professor Stecker for more 'than eighteen months has visited on an infant son
most inhuman cruelties in the name of science. According to Mrs. Solon G. Bronson, an in
timate , friend of Mrs. Stecker, the mathematical process of. raising children as practiced by
Stecker was to allow a baby from birth to be fed but once every three hours during- the day
and but twice during the night. If it cried between times it was not to be humored, and if it
continued to cry it: was whipped until it stopped. This was the treatment when the father was
at home. He said there were enough children growing up wicked, and he proposed to train his
child to regular habits from -the cradle'. He would not allow it to sleep in the daytime. If "it
criedfrom hunger, which the wife insisted it often did, he would not allow her to feed it, but
whipped it instead.
Sometimes he became so angry at the child that he placed a hand over its mouth and
held it there until the child almost strangled. He would hold the" baby up by one ear and
slap it- until it bore marks of fingers for hours. Once, when the mother was bathing the child
and'it cried, he caught it by the ankle and held it out; Kead downward, and whipped its bare
body. The baby was covered with bruises, black -and blue, day after day. Neighbors pro
tested to Stecker-and were forbidden to enter the house. They then .made formal complaint
to President Rogers^.who investigated and. secured from- Stecker an admission of the truth of
the charges, and of reform. .He is said to have begun his torture of the child the
veryday of its birth and, despite the promises- to the faculty, to have continued k till the wife
left. him,: a-few weeks ago, almost. a mental and physical wreck, the result of being forced daily
to see her child brutally beaten. The co-eds to-day refused to attend his classes, and the whole
student^ body is in revolt against his .retention. President Rogers to-night promised that
Stecker would be removed at the end of- the present term.

We have respectfully to present that, while
we Â»ir:'rove the legislation of Congress for the
txtradltion for trial of those charged with
criir.e In other lands, yet we percelva dangeroub
inconsistency in Us failure to enact the pro
posed legislation for the removal from one State
to another oV men Indicted In our country for
crinÂ»es committed acainet Us laws.
It erÂ«mi commendable to extradite those ac
cused of postal crimes in Cuba for trial in that
country, but while the greatest ha<>te is made
in 'expediting the removal of American citizens
for trial before a Fpanleh court It seems impos
sible, in view of the absence of the necessary
legislation, to remove men for trial charged
with the crimes of the highest magnitude, from
one miled States district to another.
We recommend to our representatives in Con
srep* to da all In their power to cause the
l>afÂ«-age cf the law proposed by the Attorney
General, which will have the effect of compel
ling Judges of the I'nitfJ States courts to con
form to the ertablishcl practice in euch mat
ters. Surely It is no more important to remove
for trial from New York to Cuba men wno are
charged with peculation in the amount of $100.

"The question of the enforcement of the
labor contract by injunction or contempt
in equity process is called a difficult one,
mainly made soby the abuses which have
arisen from injunctions carelessly Issued.
It is suggested that it might be well to
limit punishment for contempt to impris
onment for a brief .period, but equity
courts must not be deprived of tho power
to protect themselves and to make their
decrees respected. The practice of award
ing blanket injunctions against all the
world, or against unnumbered defendants,
as well as the practice of Indirectly en
forcing the contract 'for permanent serv
ice by enjoining employes from quitting
work, should be discouraged not only by
popular sentiment but by intelligent judi
cial opinion. .
The employment of children below the
age of 14 should be prohibited In factories.
Mne length of the working day in all pub
lic employment should be ttxed at eight
hours. Tne same time should be fixed for
workmen Jn underground mines, except
in cases of emergency. Employment in
mines of children less than 14 years ot
age and of all women and girls should
be forbidden. Congress might well enact
that no person under. 18 snould be em
ployed as a telegraph operator upon rail
roads, and that all engineers and switch
men should submit to an examination for
color blindness: also that it be made a
misdemeanor for an engtneer or switch
man to be intoxicated while on duty. A
simple and liberal law regulating the pay
ment of labor should be adopted by all
the States, providing that all laborers
shall be paid in cash orders without dis
count, not in gqods or due bills, and that
no compulsion, direct or indirect, should
be used to maJte them purchase goods at
any. particular store. .
Provisions for the fair weighing of coal
at mines before passing over a screen
should be adopted,- and the miners should
have the â¢ privilege of; employing a check

to-day," says the report, "Is perhaps that

"The history of the Army of the Poto
mac presents features which are very dis
tinctive in their character. Its record,
considering the numbers engaged and the
Eangulnary character of its battles, pre
sents a picture of martial prowess unsur
passed by any army ct modern, times. In
some of the battles in which this army
Â¦was engaged nearly a third of Us officers
and soldiers were either killed or wound
ed, while in the great battles of Europe
the losses seldom exceeded one-seventh
and In many of . the European - battles
which history describes as severe and
sanguinary the killed and wounded were
only from 5 to 10 per cent of the force en
gaged. The fearful casualty list of both
contending armies in the Civil War was
caused by the determined courage of the
army which attacked and the. stubborn
resistance of those who met and resisted
the assaulting columns. It was this he
roic conduct which brought out to their
fullest measure the splendid qualities of
American soldiers. 'Death is at all times
surrounded by sadness- and sorrow and
this is essentially true when the victims
are youthful, buoyant spirits who are al
ways first to obey their country's call to
arms; but the bravery of such men on the
field where their Hve3 are sacrificed Is
the most precious memory" In the history
of our country. Their martial example
is our pride, glory, safety and strength."
At the close of the ceremonies the Pres
idential party returned to Washington, but
the reunion exercises of the Society of the
Potomac were continued at night in the
opera-house, where addresses were made
by a number of veterans, including Gen
eral Joseph Wheeler, who said In part:
The visit of the President to Fredericks
burg was primarily in honor of the annual
reunion of the Array of the Potomac. The
town was In gala dress and turned out
en ma3se to receive the distinguished vis

comed at the Courthouse, which was dec

various corps flags of the Army of the

by prominent veterans from both sides of
the Civil War and afterward the Presi

he was welcomed by hundreds of the

The now town of White Horse contains
a number of angry settlers, who were
compelled to vacate their homes last
week by Government officers. Last fall
they purchased lots of men claiming to
have perfect title. It now appears that
the townsite is owned by the White Pass
Railroad, except every third lot, which
was reserved fot/the crown. Settlers on
these crown lots were compelled to move
without ceremony. Their vigorous pro
tests were unavailing. It is claimed that
the men who sold the lot? have since left.
Indications are that four or five thou
sand men will leave Dawson for Nome.
Some of them will go on barges, taking
houses from Dawson and running the
risk of getting tugs to tow them across
Bering Sea from the mouth of the Yukon
to Nome.
These dispatches indicate that much ex
citement prevails at Dawson ' over the
early opening of the Yukon and the pos
sibility thus afforded Klondikers to join
the Nome stampede. The cleanup on
some of the creeks being nearly com
pleted, several thousand men were anx
iously preparing to take the first steam
ers down the river. They were making
bets freely that they would reach Nome
before the passengers on the steamers
from Puget Sound and other ports.

Flora, Florence S and Gustin had arrived
there from Lebarge. They were to start
back at once. ; N

week and was followed on Sunday by the
steamers Gleaner and Australian, both of
which will carry railroad materials from
Bennett to Carlboul The Canadian Devel

Australian and Bailey through White

They will then operated on the Yukon,

"I'd like to know how much of this kind ,

He bitterly denounced the yynaicates I
which had oef-n organized unuer New I

"It Is an outrage on all public decency,"

With earnestness and vigor he arraigned
the new Panama Canal Company for nav

passage of the Nicaragua canal bill at ]
the present session. :
"Never." he declared, "has the t'nited
States Government and the L'nited States
Congress been badgered and cuffed about
as we have by this new Panama Canal
Company, and the quiet submission and
eas* with which we take it can be ac
counted for only in one way. and that is
the Presidential el<*etion Is pending and
we are afraid to tackle any corporation
that bas, or professes to have, some great
powex."
Morgar. maintained there was no proper
reason why the pending Nicaragua canal
bill should not b*- passed at once. It was
demanded by the people and they would
demand an accounting from the politi
cians. He could not believe the President
was in leag-ue with the politicians, who
were antagonizing the canal bill.
"For," he inquired vehemently, "is it to
be eald here that the President is a party
to this ambidextrous and cross-eyed po
litical rascality?"
H*> did not believe either that the Presi
dent was so afraid of British influence
that he had an idea in his mind of aban
doning the canal project.
"As to the bill before the Senate." de
clared Morgan, referring to the Philip
pine measure, "it i* manifest that it can
not pas? C"ngrcÂ«s at this session; indeed,
it can never pass this Congress. It is ir
rational now for Congress to legislate for
conditions so remote, unknown and so
hazardous.
"ThÂ«Â» President, who is a candidate for
re-election." said he, "is in thÂ«? hands of
his friends and his friends are the ene

r>urlnÂ«r the consideration of one of the
bi'.ls Taibert of South Carolina made an
assault upon thp manner in which pension
bills were rushed through. He cited the
case of Arthur Dinsmore. an I1S00 depart
ment clerk, for whose benefit Congress re
cently passed a bill, increasing his pension
from J^l to $72 per month. Congress, he
paid, was so ashamed tit its outrageous
action after it discovered what had been
done that the till was recalled from the
President after it hÂ«d pone to him for his
signature. Dlnsmore was a private in the
Third Michigan Infantry. Talbert charged
that in addition to his Government salary
and pension he was drawing 1100 a month
as secretary of one of the members of
the Invalid Pension Committee of the
House. S. W. Smith of Michigan.
Smith replied and said Dinsmore's condi
tion was deplorahle and prevented him
attending: to his duties, so that he had to
pay all pave about J2<X) of his pay from
the sneaker for assistance in doing the
work and had to lose three to five months
each year from the pension office without
pay.
Gardner of Michigan, who knew Mr.
Din?more personally, also gave the House
a trraphic description of his sufferings.
Every dollar of his pension money. $24 per
month, he said, went to pay doctors" bills.
Talbert said if these things were true
the pension office should grant Mr. Dins
more $72 per month.

Mr. Price announces ih?U. his marriage
to Miss Eugenie Dyer, which was to have
taken place on Monday, next In the
Church of the Epiphany, will occur to
morrow at the bride's residence in this
city. There will be no bridesmaid, no
maids of honor and no guests. It was
reported yesterday that the marriage
would be indefinitely postponed because
of the failure.
When Mr. Price was asked If It were
true that a member of the firm, unknown
to the other partners, had speculated In
cotton, and if such things were not con
trary to the rules of the flrm, he said:
"in regard to that question. I. have ab
solutely no statement to make."
"If Mr. Crocker made such a statement
as that it was very unkind of him, as he
yÂ» not thoroughly acquainted with the
facts. We sent him a dispatch at the time
of our suspension and ne probably was
irritated and drew his own conclusions.
This statement purported to have been
made by Mr. Crocker is a great injustice
to other members of the firm. Mr.
Crocker was not thoroughly acquainted
with the firm's operations up to the pres
ent time. Jt was but a short time ago
that he returned from Kurope. He held
an interest of 5500,000 aa a special partner
and seldom came to the office. Our sus
pension was as great a surprise to me as

FRENCH SENATE
BRINGS UP THE
DREYFUS AFFAIR
Discusses Alleged Meddling
in the Case by a
Detective.
Officers of the Army Are Warned
That They Must Consider the
Case to Be Closed
Forever. â¢ ,
PARIS. May 25. â The question of the al
leged meddling of Detective Tomps In the
Dreyfus affair, which was warmly dis
cussed at the opening of the Chamber of
Deputies, was brought up In the Sonata
this afternoon by the Minister of "War.
The Marquis de Gallifet on Tuesday de
nied the existence of the Tomps letters,
and the Ministry, through the Interpel
lator, M. Humbert, flatly contradicted
him. The Marquis de Gallifet to-day ex
pressed regret at the fact that he had
misled the Chamber, as, he said, he had
since ascertained that M. Humbert's
statement was correct. The letters, he as
serted, existed at the Ministry without his |
knowledge. The Minister of War then an
nounced that the documents had fallen
into the hands of politicians, who had them
during the debate on Tuesday by tha
crime of an officer of the War Office, who
had divulged them. This officer, the Min
ister continued, had been immediately
cashiered. "The officer, as an explana
tion." said Gallifet, "made the unheard-of
remark that 'what I did was political.'
and he, aa an officer, dared to say this to
the Minister of War, when It is the first
duty of an officer to avoid politics." â¢
"As I declared before," continued the
War Minister, ''and since entering the
Ministry, the Dreyfus Incident, now thae
the Rennes courtmartial has taken place.
Is closed. All the army has been warned
and any soldier departing from this Una
of conduct knows what to expect"
The Premier. M. Waldeck-Rousseau.
followed and gave a lengthy explanation
of the Tomps affair, finally announcing
that Tomps had been transferred and that
the incident was closed.
The officer disgraced by the Marquis da
Gallifet is Captain Frltsch. who Is said
to be an Alsatian.

NEW YORK. May 25.â Joe Gans of Bal
timore knocked out Dal Hawkins of Cali
fornia at the Broadway Athletic Club to
night in two rounds of the fastest fight
ing ever seeA in the clubhouse. The men
were scheduled to go twenty-five rounds
at 133 pounds and both scaled under the
limit. Hawkins assumed tho aggressive
at once and sailed in on his man with
both hands. He smashed the Baltimore
man with a left hook to the chin lust
after they put up their hands and dropped
him. It looked as if the affair was all
over, but Gans took the count of nine and
got to his feet. Hawkins followed him
fast, but Grins was all there with his
blocks and in a- fierce mix-up at tho ropes
sent, in a right swing to the Jaw that
floored Hawkins. â¢ Again -it seemed that
the result was reached. Hawkins was all
but out. but struggled to his feet at the
count of nine. The fighting was furious

In the second round the men continued
their rapid pace. Gans had Hawkins
gauged, however, and easily, avoided his

Higher education was the topic under
discussion yesterday by the Congrega
tional Congress. President David Start
Jordan of Stanford University and Presi
dent Benjamin Ide Wheeler of Berkeley
were the leading speakers. Professor E.
E. Brown of the State University also
contributed an able paper. Professor
Jordan spoke in the afternoon on "The
Higher Education of the Pacific Coast."
and Professor Wheeler occupied the en
tire evening eession in a discussion of
"The Qualifications of the Teacher." The
latter discussion was largely analytical
and highly instructive.
Professor Jordan declared that the
pressure of higher education is greater
around the bay of San Francisco at thÂ«v
present time than anywhere else in the
L'nited States. It is showing the highest
development of the modern idea of edu
cation, as far removed from the old tra
ditional Idea as the time and space that
intfrvene. England and Germany differ
in their ideas of the university. The Eng
lish University was established lor the
learned classes, as a badge of superiority
and a training place for diplomats and
ministers of the established church. Out
of this arose the so-called higher educa
tion that had sway for centuries, the
study of I^atin, Greek and mathematics
being regarded as the one essential thing.
This sort of education was brought over
to this country and certainly proved of
value for mind training.
The more modern and truly democratic
idea is that higher education should bÂ»
open for all men. It was first recognized
In the founding of Cornell College,
where Ezra Cornell announced that any
man could get Instruction in anything.
Now it is recognized that it is better to
get advanced knowledge in one thing
than to have a smattering of many
things; to study Greek for ten years than
ten languages for one year. Nowadays
a competent electrician is better educat
ed than a quack doctor, a preacher or
professor.
We in America rather follow the Ger
man university, which is chiefly charac
terized by its breadth. The German uni
versity is a place for original research and
the dissemination of knowledge. The
American ideal Is higher than either the
German or English. The German aims to
make a. man learned and thorough, the
English to educate him along certain tra
ditional lines; the American leads on to
acticn and enables a man to do his work
in the world.
The fault with our universities is that
the teacher does not â¢ come Into close
tnough contact with his students. This
can be corrected by increasing the num
ber of teachers. President Harper of the
Chicago University has proposed that the
smaller colleges discontinue their work at
the end of tne sophomore year and then
send students to Chicago. Dr. Jordan did
not favor this plan, believing that the
smaller college ought to remain indepen
dent.
Professor Brown followed Professor
Jordan with an able address on "Religious
Forces in Higher Education." Both ad
dresses were afterward discussed by the
congress. Rev. R. C. .Brooks of Oakland
spoke on "The Bible We Use" and Rev.
W. C. Kantner of Salom read an able pa
per on "The Christ We Preach."
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler's ad- 1
dress in the evening was listened to with
marked attention. He said in part:
"The philosopher is a son of the East;
the student a child of the West: the
teacher a child of Hellas.- where a man
knew his world and lived in it. The
preacher is half prophet and half teacher,
without Inspiration.
"There are two ways of. looking at the
uses of teaching. There is a teaching
that fits the individual to make the most
of himself. Those teachers who think they
are teaching recipes are the most mis
taken. There is nothing a teacher can do
but to furnish proper food. The other
view inheres in the recognition that we
ar tfi m Â£ mbcr s of a historical society in
which he must learn to accommodate him-
"The first food for a child is to teach
it to fasten its attention on what there

its y.ork. What we make out of mathe-
m Â£ Â°h Â¦}% <; ontinul ty ot action. It teaches

Statement of President Konda of the
Nippon Yussn Kaisha Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. May 23.-R. Konda.
president of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
Company, in an interview here to-night
said the Japanese Government would un
doubtedly restrict emigration to America.
He had urged all Consuls to advise the
Government strongly to take that course,
and had himself wired them to that ef
fect.
â¢ I do , not think that apprehension need
growâ¢ out of the recent admission of some
twenty-five Doukhobors. for. while .they were
evidently assisted there was no evidence
upon. which to prove that they were contract
laborers: their movements are being care
fully watched, and if It should - be deter
mined that they really came under contract
I am Informed, and I believe reliably so,
that the Japanese Government is opposed to
the emigration of Its subjects. If such Is
the case it is possible that that Government
would ,be wtllins to unite with our* in a
modification ' of the treaty of 1S94: but as
that is a matter with which the Immigration
Bureau has nothing to do I merely direct
your attention to It In passing, for It rests
with Congress to take the initiative in such
a matter.
Opposed to Emigration.
The agitation of 1377-7? to which you refer
was for the passage of a law to exclude the
Chinese from admission to the United States,
but it was found that under the treaty of
If 08, known as the Burllngame treaty, the
Chinese had. under article V, the right to
free migratlcn to the United States "for
purposes of curiosity, of trade or as perma
nent residents." The agitation to which you
refer having crystallized Into a sentiment
acalnst further Immigration of Chinese.
Consress authorized the President to ap
point r. committee "to negotiate a modifi
cation of the existing treaties which shall
not be in direct contravention of their
.spirit": and following that came the treaty
ot 1SS0 with China known as the "Immigra
tion treaty." Since then it has been possi
ble to enact legislation which has been ef
> fectlve In excluding Chines* laborers.
It would appear that wMle the treaty of
1SS4 with Japan remains In full force and
effect, no 'law, except such as would apply
alike to persons of all nationalities belong
ing to the same class or classes, can be
made effective. ;
"The citizens or subjects of .each of the
two high contracting parties shall have full
liberty to enter, travel or reside in any part
of the territories, of the other contracting
party, and iÂ»hall enjoy full and perfect pro
.tectlon for their persons and property."
\ The concluding paragraph of article 2 of
that treaty, which deals with commerce and
navigation, eays:
"It Is, however, understood that the stipu
lations contained In this and the preceding
article do not in any -way affect the laws,
ordinances and regulations with regard to
trade, the immigration of laborers, police
and public security which are In force or
which may hereafter be enacted In either of
the two countries."
In the treaty between the United States
and Japan concluded November 22, 1S94, and
ratified by the President February 15, 1S95, it
is provided In the first paragraph of article I
that: *.
Treaty With Japan.
The courts have so Interpreted the alien
contract labor law as to require that evi
dence of a contract, having been made
abroad, must be produced in evidence In
order to bar an Immigrant suspected of be
ing a contract laborer. The courts have not
us yet ruled upon the alien contract labor
law considered in the light of the causes out
of which it grew. Up to the present time
the attorneys for the Government, In trying
cases of violation of the alien contract labor
law. have declared upon the existence of a
contract and have endeavored to prove that
a contract existed, instead of attempting to
Bhow that the object aimed at in the passage
of the alien contract labor law, to wit., the
protection of the American workman from
competition with cheao foreign labor, was
belntr frustrated. Under existing law and
decisions based upon It It Is difficult to re
ject those cemlns In violation of the alien
contract labor law. and as the Japanese oc
cupy the same position In the eye of the latv
as citizens and subjects of the most favored
nation- they cannot be rejected when apply
ing for admlsslcn unless it is shown upon
special Inquiry that they belong to one or
the other of the foregoing excluded classes.
An evidence that Japanese immigrants are
Instructed or "coached" is found in the fact
that nearly every one comes provided with
$30. which he terms his "show money." The
Impression that the sum of 130 is necessary
is entertained by more than the Japanese,
but as a matter of fact no amount of money
Is required.
Section 1, act, of March 3, 1893, requires
that Immigrants shall state "whether in
possession of money, and if so. whether up
ward of $30, and how much if $30 or less."
The act does not specify, however, that fail
ure to produce $30 shall be a bar to admis
sion, for In passing upon the right of an im
migrant to land all the facts bearing on his
case shall be considered. Immigration offi
cials at San Francisco, at Puget Sound and
at Vancouver, n. C, have reason to believe
that the emigration companies of Japan
provide each emigrant for whom a passage
is secured with WO; that this sura Is either
turned over to the agent in this country on
the admission of the immigrant or subse
quently paid by him from his earnings here;
and there is little doubt but that the "show
money" of the Japanese immigrant is, as a
rule, provided by another In order to secure
his admission to the United States.
Evidence of a Contract Essential.
In order to check as far na possible this
influx of Japanese the department has given
the Collector of Customs at Port Townsend
authority to employ special Inspectors and
those already stationed along Puget Sound
have been Instructed to exercise greater vig
ilance. Another regular Inspector has been
detailed for duty at Port Townsend. and
the Supervising Special Immigration In
spector is now Investigating the coming of
so many Japanese, the causes leading to the
recent Increase In Immigration, the destina
tion of said Immigrants and the parties to
whom they apply for work; in addition
thereto he will ascertain and report upon
the most suitable points on the border at
which to station additional immigration In
rpectorB.
Difficult to Keep Them Out.
Under the law, as at present framed, it
is very difficult to prevent the admission of
alien contract laborers or assisted Immi
grants who may be of the excluded classes.
Section 1 of the act of March 3, 1S91, speci
fies that the following shall be excluded:
"Ali Idiots, Insane persons, paupeis- or
persons likely to become a public charge,
persons suffering from a loathsome or a dan
gerous contagious disease, persons who have
been convicted of a felony or other Infamous
crime or misdemeanor Involving moral turpi
tude, and also any person whose ticket or
passage is paid, unless It Is affirmatively
and satisfactorily shown on special Inquiry
that such person does not belong to one of
the foresroins excluded classes."
Many are under the impression that a
"person whose ticket : is paid -for with the
money of another, or who Is assisted by
others to come," may bÂ«-excluded because
of such assistance; but if. it is shown on spe
cial inquiry that such person docs not be
long to one of the excluded classes above
mentioned such assistance is not to be con
sidered a bar to his admission.
The above gives, In brief, an outline of the
methods which were employed a year ago,
and I have reason to believe that the Japa
nese emigration companies are more active
than they were at that time. Hut. profiting
by part experience, and In order to elude
tlif vigilance of immigration officials at
American ports, are sending the bulk of
their human freleht to Canada, where, I
have no doubt, they are taken in hand by
agents of these companies and carefully In
structed how and when to gain admittance
to the United States.
Taken First to Canada.
Our immlsration officials at Vancouver
report that those landing there, not tlck
â¢ete.1 to the United States, disappear In a.
very short time and that no trace of them
can be found in that neighborhood. Advices
from Consular Agents and others go to show
that 90 per cent of the Japanese landing in
Canada eventually find their way into the
Copies of j the contracts and affidavits
taken at that time, at the port of San Fran
cisco, Fhow how these Japanese emigrant
companies manage to secure the admittance
of their people into the United States. On
the return of Mr. Rice from JaiÂ»an instruc
tions were . l3Â»ued to thÂ» officials at San
Francirco and alens the border to care
fully examine every Japanese emigrant.
This resulted in the sending back cf a num
ber In whose possession contracts with emi
gration companies were found. Since then
the form ot contract has been altered tn
crder to conform to tho Immigration lawa
of the United States, but in every case
where a contracfls produced the Immigrant
has be*-n ordered deported. At the present
time, owlnp to the vigilance of the Immi
gration officials, the Japanese emigrants
landing at flan Francisco, or at Vancouver
cr Victoria, destined for the United States,
do not brins a scrap of paper with them,
and while our officials may be morally cer
tain that they are coming under contract,
they can find no evidence on which to ex
clude them under our laws. During the
month ot April. 1900, there arrived at Vic
toria â¬092 Asiatics, nearly double as many
as during the three months preceding.
Contract Holders Deported.
tioned against repeating a word of the in
structions given them, or volunteering in
formation oi any kind in answer to in
quiries. .'
SENATOR GEORGE C. PERKINS
has been looking up the matter of
immigration, . and . particularly the
problems that present themselves
In tho immigration question on the Pacific
Coast. Ho has been in communication
with, the Commissioner General of Immi
gration at Washington and laid before
him the conditions at present existing on
this side of the continent, calling his at
tention especially to the mass meeting
that was held in Metropolitan Hail in
this city on May 7. He asked what was
being done to prevent the entrance into
this country' of laborers coming within
the prohibition of the law*. In reply he
received a long and . detailed statement
from the Commissioner General, which
'statement he immediately forwarded to
Ed Rosenberg, secretary of the Labor
Council of this city. The statement In
full is as follows:
Emigration Companies of Japan.
OFFICE O F COM S OSKR.G E NER A I.
WASHINGTON. May 17, 1900,
â¢â¢â¢Â»Â«., r-onrep C Perkins,. United States
<=e"a?or Washington. D. C.-Dear Sir: I
hive yours of the 14th inst.. in which you
dfict n"y attention to the fact that "the
laboring People of the Pacific Ooast are
fast RrninK into a frame of mind similar
tÂ« thnt of 1S7T-T5. when the aggressive
action began which resulted In the Chinese
exclusion bill": that "they are becoming
measures be taken," etc. I note that you
SSueit that I make mien reply as will
Jnow what the immigration bureau ii . "do-
In* to exclude contract and sen lie labor In
thl way of appointing Inspectors at A an-
C Â°Tne r emlKratlon from Japan of aped, In
firm or incapacitated is practically . pro
hibit <Â»j' owl&rto the fact, that, the Jap.
an"** Government requires that the wib
lertntJDlvinB fÂ°r a passport shall provide
two "uretle" "that the applicant will not
become a public charge or fall .Into dts
treVa for the term of three years." To the
exigence of this law is, due no doubt, he
oreaniratlon of some -twelve, emigration
Sanlei each of which undertakes to
provMe the IntendlnK emigrant with the
two TfuVuos upon, which his passport will
be If sued. The files of this office will show
that the emigration company not only pro
vides the sureties but that the officers of
the company act In that capacity them
selves You will- observe that the Japanese
law 'Which was intended to restrict em l-
JTrStlon l.y--maklnÂ« It difficult for the In
tending emigrant to secure his passport,
called Into existence the em!i?ratti>n oom
r.anv, which provides passport and "urettes
as well. While there is no evidence In th a
bureau to fhow from what source the emi
gration company derives its revenue It is
reasonable to assume that It is not actuated
bv unselfish or philanthropic motives. The
emigrants are obliged to s?ll whatever prop
erty they may be possessed of or else their
relatives nnd friends go upon their bonds
to secure the company which procures their
passports. From the Gelbi Nichl Nlchl. a
leading dally paper published at Hiroshima.
Japan, I quote as follows:
Generally of an Ignorant Class.,
"The emigrants are generally of the
ignorant farming classes, and belnK Igno
rant of the way to obtain Government per
mission there were started a number of
emigration companies. The said companies
charged them very high prices for SBi-vices.
and when the emigrant arrived at n's
destination agents of these companies took
them to bad boarding-houses and charged
them very -high t prices..' and roosrt of all,
9ald agents would not secure them tne
'promised work." ' :
It would appear from the foreROlns: that
the emigration companies of Japan, acting
upon the advice of their agents In foreign
lands, stimulate emigration and do it
through advertising In their newspapers as
well as through their agents, who are In
many Instances the officers of the villages
and towns (I infer as much from the con
cluding words of th<? editorial which ap
peared In the same issue of the paper
above mentioned): after commenting on the
hardships imposed upon the emigrants by
the said companies the editorial concludes
with these words:
"The managers of such companies are, of
course, very bad, yet the . officers of the.
villages and towns who stand In with such
companies are to be more condemned."
Mr. Rice, ex-commissioner of immigration
at Vancouver, B." C. went to Japan In No
vember. 1S9S. under instructions from this
bureau to Investigate the causes of Jap
anese emigration, and while there secured
, much valuable Information on the subject.
From various sources he learned that the
emigration companies are officered by in
fluential and wealthy Japanese, who en
deavor to make it difficult for an intending
emigrant to procure a passport if he does
not do so through one or another of these
companies. It is claimed that by taking
the ordinary course it will require from
pIx to nine months to procure. a passport,
but through the instrumentality of an emi
gration company it may be procured in
from two days to two weeks.
City Officials Solicit Patronage.
Mr. Rice reports that the emigration com
panies do not employ traveling agenvs, but
rely upon the officials of cities, and towns
to solicit patronage, "examine candidates
and Instruct them as to necessary prepara
tions and correct fees." They also, "ad
vertise in local papers. Bend out- circulars
and use bulletins which are written In large
characters so that all may read."' . Â¦
Mr. Uice had an Interview . with a .Mr.
Totsumoto, manager of the Nippon Japan
Imln Kaisha. one of the leading emigration
companies of Kobe, who reluctantly said:
"We have no blanks. When emigrants
arÂ» wanted we send out agents and collect,
them. The emigrant business Is a small
part of our business. â¢ We send no emigrants
to th* United States or Canada. Ves, the
steamship companies do allow commissions
or discounts on their rates. The amount
of this discount depends upon the number
of emigrants offered. . We have no agents
in the United States or Canada." Â¦';
From the official Gazette, a publication
Issued by the Imperial Government, Mr.
lilce copied the following, which would in
dicate that -Mr. Yotsumato's memory was
a "On March 13 permission has been given
from the Department of State for Foreign
Affairs to Mr. Hachltaro Hamnnka, man
ager of Japan Emigration Company, that
Mr Masataro Mito shall act as his agent
In 'the neighborhood of Victoria, British
Canada. The address of Japan Emigration
Company, 85 Sakalmachi Nichome, Kobe,
Japan."
Free and Contract Emigrants. 1
The emigration company herein referred
to is'the one for which Mr. Yotsumoto acts
as manager. Japanese emigrants" are of two
kindsâ free and contiact. The contract emi
grants, according to a statement made to
Mr R'ce by an American, who has resided
fo-" several years In Japan, but for pru
dential reasons does not care to have his
name made public, are bound to the emigra
tion company for a period of three years,
and while we have not beer, able to procure
such evidence as would prove the existence
of a contract with a person, firm or corpo
ration in the United States, every circum
stance attending the coming of large num
bers of Japanese points to the fact that
agents of these companies, in the United
States are actively engaged in securing em
ployment in advance of the coming of Japa
nese emlsrants. The gentleman whp vol
unteers the Information to Mr. Rice paid:
"Both free and contract, emigrants are
alike soliclK-d and induced to go. The free,
however, are much less in number than the
others. The â¢ companies have agents In
Canada, America, Hawaii and Australia.
The' acent abroad rets orders from con
tractors and sends them to the companies
in Japan. The contract laborers to Canada
aro rreater in number than in the United
States, the latter being few. The contract
to Canada Is for three years. Free eml- Â¦
grants to Canada do not know beforehand'
the character of their work nor the amount
of their wages.. It^ls difficult to find contract
laborers coins to- Canada or America. The
emigrants are loth to answer questions
â¢ aboout their Bolmr. etc."
Go F*rth Blindly.
You will obseifve that those going to
Canada are not Informed, previous to their
departure from .Japan, of the character of
work to be performed, or wages to be paid
to them, and the fact that- they were loth
to answer questions as to their probable
destination wouln indicate that the Inten
tion was to evÂ»<Je our alien contract labor
laws by crossing, over to the United States
' after landing In British Columbia. This
gentleman Informed Mr. Rice that he was l
an eye-witness to a meeting held in a pub
lic place between an official of an emigra
tion company and a number of Japanese
laborers, who had been assembled prior to
thalr * derarture.' , and he beard them cau-

"ipNEV. PETER C. YORKE was the
\^J) guest Of the evening at the gradu
< iÂ£\v ating exercises of St. Mary's Col-
N ~ lege to-nisbt. At the close of the
school exercises he delivered an address
to the graduates, in which he made sar

Jordan's recent address upon small col
lopes, referred to the fact that Benjamin
Ide Wheeler was an ordained minister.
made several remarks upon recent moves
by the presidents of the two big univer
sities and added something about liberty
in the United States, which she was ex
emplifying: in her for^'.prn possessions. The
iaCdrcFs v.as full of striking statements.
The- Macdonough Theater, in which the I
< xcrcises wore hold, was crowded to the |
doors, and the exercises wore very inter
esting. After the presentation of the med
als and decrees tho Rev. Father Yorke
was Introduced to the audience. He said
In part:
"It gives me great pleasure to address
thpfe who have be-on for s<> many years
under the instructions of the eood Chris
tian Brothers of Pt. Mary's College, and
I hope th.it I may be able to give you
tome good advice. Good advice is cheap.
ar.d I suppose that is why it is so freely
given. The essays r^ad this evening have
treated on many subjects, but in not one
was there recognizable the cant and hy
pocrisy that characterize the age we live
In.
An Age of Hypocrisy.
"To-day we are In thÂ« twentieth century
where Europe wa9 In the seventeenth.
It Is surely an age of hypocrisy. We
stand up before the world and talk of
liberty and freedom and the stars and
Ftrlpes and all that they represent, while
at tho same time we murder and rob
those whom we have come to set freeâ
rob them as they never were robbed
by those we were pleased to call their
oppressors.
"In the name of humanity we shoot
down men whose only crime is that they
are defending their homes and native
land. Because we are manacled with
chains of pold we look upon the greatest
crime the world has ever seen without
an effort to prevent the terrible slaughter
that is going on. We worship the spirit
called liberty, but it is only what we make
it ourselves. A fetid corpse is patriotism
and her hand when gxasped has a clammy
feeling.
"It is a good thing that the admiration
cf the old virtues is not extinct. Better
liberty in poverty than the world when
you have to fall down and worship the.
spirit of gold.
'â¢This is the season when the public
school teachers meef^n institute and at
tempt to tell the world how to run Its own
affairs This is the season when the col
lr-ee president is running at large, w e
are told of the defects of the present
school system and of how the small col
le SpÂ£id&? David Starr Jordan tells us
how the education of the future must be
'rom the great colleges and not from tne
fnall colU ; ses. He would make the great
private college at Palo Alto the same in
'titution in education as the fctandard Oil
Company is in business. LÂ«Â»t us remember
that education is not a matter for the
State What is one mans business is not
that of his neighbor. The education of the
children is with the parents and the
â¢ bllcation with the parents. It is neces
narv to keep the school close to the people.
Some of our learned public educators are
of the opinion that the principal danger of
civilization is from the interference of the
politician in the public schools. The cry
of 'Take the public schools out of the
hands of the politicians' is dishonest. It
simply means 'Take it away from this ele
ment "and bestow it upon those who fa
vor us.
Presumption of College Presidents.
"The presidents of the two great educa
tional institutions, the University of Cali
fornia and that great private plax-e of
learr.ir.p to the couth, the Iceland btanrord
jr. . u*ii%-crsity. iJÂ«vÂ« declared, that tae
pupils of our schools should be taught
j. >*â¢!>â¢ by graduates from their universities.
Why should this be so? The schools were
built for the pupil and not for the teacher.
The San Francisco School Board has sug
gested a new system by which it claims
only the trulv good may be realized, and
in order that their scheme may be carried
out get Presidents Jordan and Wheeler to
rrepare plans by which the teachers of
the future are to be chosen. The teachers
cf schools should be selected by the rep
resentatives of their own districts, and
not by men who are called from afar.
"It is high time for the public schools
to co out of business when they put a
monopoly upon education and the sole
mpplic-rs of the teachers in this State are
the two great universities.
"The rireeident of Berkeley is a clergy
man. Suppose a priest was appointed to
any T>osition in the university, a howl
Â¦vm'uld go up that would shake your heels.
There is only one way, and that is for
Catholics to have their own schools and
colleges. President Jordan of Stanford
tays: 'Give a ten-dollar boy a hundred
doiiar education and it won't make him
a better man.' Give a ten-cent professor
a SUMO khIhtv and it will not make him
worth a b'.t more.
Insult to Catholic Schools.
"I criticize these new departures in pub
lic education. It is an insult to our Cath
olic schools and colleges, the careful in
structors of which you see before you
here to-nipht. Are incn or women to
have no chr.nce for th*Â»;r daily bread un
less they have praduated from one of two
preat univerF'ties? The condemnation of
the. small college by the presidents of
California's great universities has no
foundation whatever, ihc small colleges
are the m^st potent forces in our educa

The Japanese coming across, he said,
are lured to America by the glowing ac
counts of their own countrymen, who are
sadly betraying them. He found hundreds
whose money had all gone when they
were landed and who were penniless and
in a deplorabie condition. Hundreds of
these destitute were to be shipped back
to Japan. The best remedy to stay the
influx. Mr. Konda said, was for Americans
not to employ the Japanese, for as long
as employment was given them they
would continue to come in. The steam
ship men were not to blame for the in
flux, he said, as had been reported. ThÂ«
Japanese were misled and duped by their

ACTIVITY ON THE COURTS.
The California Pigeon and Homing So
ciety held the third race of the season's
series last Sunday from Siskiyou, approx
imately 300 miles. There were sixty com
peting birds in the race. They were lib
erated at 5 a. m.. the weather being re
ported clear. The race resulted as fol
lows:
John FHmer's Rover A535 arrived at 12:43:30
p. m., distance 2S8 miles 672 yards, average
speed 1111 3-100 yards per minute.
The second bird in was H. C. Worth's A13 at
12:54:30 p. m., distance 194 miles 567 yards, aver
ape- speed 1093 79-100 yards per minute.
Thirdâ J. narnen" A2494 arrived at 3:44:S0
p. m., distance 193 miles . 235 yards, . speed
806 45- ICO yards per minute. The birds of H.
Meyer, G. T. Marsh. G. N. Marsh, W. Hartery
and J. Smith not reported.
On Decoration day the fourth race of
the series "will -be held, the 'birds being
liberated at Drains, Or., the 400-mile Â«ta
tlon of the homing society. In the threfj
races alreafly held the birds from the loft
of H. C. Worth have been close competi
tors in each finish, and in the coming 400
mile race the chances are about equal as
to the first arrival at Mr. AVorth's loft or
at J. Filmer's. Both lofta will fly their
best birds. J. Filmer's A 555 being a. strain
from birds having a record of 560 miles.
H. C. Worth's A 13 is a strain from birds
having a record of 572 miles in one day.
This bird was second in the 100-mile race
and also in the 200 and 300 mile races,
showing a speed of 1309 yards per minute
from Redding. In view of the- good rec
ords of both birds an interesting race is
expected when they meet in the race from
Oregon.
HOMING PIGEONS' FLIGHT.
Two victories in three games played last
week on the local diamond sent Sacra
mento further away from the other teams
of the league. Nearly 100 per cent sep
arates the capital city team from the
Stocktons, and that club tops Oakland
with almost the same advantage. San
Francisco, a surly tailenderi trails the
column some 300 per cent behind the
champions. , The standing ,of the teams. to

The cup of bitterness of TTncle Hank
Harris has been filled to the brim. With
a crippled team he had to face the eham
pions of the league in three straight
games, and managed to pull out just one
victory. The probability is that he would
not have secured that if it had not been
for the fact that one of the Sacramento
twirlers was indisposed and refused to do
a double turn in the box. Harris la intent
upon infusing new blood into his aggre
gation, and if he accomplishes all he con
templates there will probably be a decided
change for the better. | He has begun by
relegating Henry Krug to the bench, as
Henry has not been playing in his old
form. In fact, he has been playing in bad
form and has been a sore disappointment
to his old-time admirers. His place will
be filled by "Jimmy" Sullivan, who re
turned from Kansas City recently with n.
maimed hand. Sullivan played good ball
fpr Kansas City and has not been re
leased, but prefers to play in his native
city. He will be seen in the games this
week. He will go behind the bat, while
Schwartz will be sent to shortstop.
Schwartz has played in the infield in the
East and is confident' he will make a suc
cess in his new position. The youngster
has made a hit with the public and Man
ager Harris regards Mm as a valuable
player. Â¦Â¦; He intends to improve, his team
still further,. but though there are players
on the market he does not wish to make
any haphazard selections. He says he
will n<^t J sfgri a player unless he is* quite
sure he is : a decided improvement on some
man whom ho is prepared .to release.
This* week- the Stocktons-, will make the
trip to .this city to play three games
against the locals. By taking two games
from' the Dudes last week the Stocktons
jumped -into second place and are only
two games- behind the leaders. On Dec
oration day a regular lengue game will be.
played at Recreation* Park by the Oak

Kittiwake and the sloops Venture and
Dart may start in this class.
The little yawl Kittiwake has recently

AT UNION PARK
Olympic ladies' day in Belvedere cove
was in several respects a highly success
ful opening of the rowing season of 1900.
The weather was bright and warm, there
was little wind in the cove and the water
was consequently smooth. Ail those who
had entered started, and the event at
tracted a notably large crowd of specta
tors. The four-oared barge race brought
Â¦ out flÂ« crewj and was t a pretty and well
contested event, though tbiiAIameda crew
tind. rhe Alnme.ia* rowed sthe rapid ex
tremely shore Stroke which has become
characteristic of them. They got away
with a lead, led up to the turn and were
never pressed. They won, however, not
because tneir stroke is a good one but
because the crew was well together and
able through its excellent physical condi
tion to follow the heart-breaking pace set
fiv . Lewis. The shortness of the course
W m rt was ]!? rob abJy not more than one
mile 440 yards at the most, was in their
| favor. The. South Ends secured third
i Place. The Olympics, though athletic
I men in good bodily condition, were not
1 â¢ rSm i?,.H' 1 n , d finished 1" fourth place.
The difficulties of racing were considera
ble in a cove where so many yachts and
arks lie at anchor, and even when the
yachts themselves were not In the way of
the oarsmen their moorings and pickups
were serious obstacles. The yacntsmen
showed themselves quite willing to pro
vide a clear course, but the officials in
charge devoted too little time and atten
tion to this all important matter. Then
nve barges required five marks to turn,
and though the regatta committee had
been specially warned of the strong cur
rent running near Belvedere Point and ad
vised to provide marks with sufficient
holding power to resist it, two out of the
nve marks drifted away. For five boats
to attempt to round three marks is to in
vite disaster, and as the Alameda barge
was rounding one of the buoys the Dol
phin barge came up to the same mark,
striking the Alameda boat full amidships.
Though rhe crew was not compelled to
retire from the race, considerable "injury
was done to the barge. The Dolphins
after the race protested on the ground
that the Alamedas had rounded their
stake, but the protest was not allowed.
The race between Stanley Adderlev of
the Tritons and George Baker of the Dol
phins was won easily by the latter. Ad
derlry was slow in starting and did not
steer a good course. After the turn his
steering was still more erratic, and Baker
won without extending himself. The ju
nior outrigger skin* race brought out five
competitors. Charles Wilson of the A'rle^s
though he pulls an uneven stroke his
right hand being much stronger than hN
left, won easily. He wandered over the
course so much that he ran great danger
of being fouled while in the water of, one
of his competitors. In the consolation
barge race between the Olympic crews
one and two the crew stroked by Alex W
Pape contrary to general expectations,
failed to win. Tape, though a good oars
man and hard worker, would do better
service in the waist of a barge than on
the stroke thwart. The whole affair was
quite interesting, and should prove to the
railroad companies that the oarsmen can
draw a crowd. "

OARSMEN TALK
OF LADIES' DAY
AT BELVEDERE
on the San Francisco Trap-shooting As
sociation grounds in competition for the
valuable silver trophy offered by Edward
Donohoe, a wealthy patron of the sport.
The shooting will be at twenty-five birds
on a handicap basis. The marks on which,
the competitors stand will be allotted by
a committed mad? up of Dr. S. E.
Knowles. M. C. Allen and J. J. Sweeney.
The handicap rise will be not less than
twenty-six yard* and not more than thir
ty-one yards, according to the conditions
under which the cup was offered.
A special tournament has been arranged
to bring together on one day the members

will be on the "miss and out" plan. Tha
date selected is July L In addition to the
shoot there will be a bullshead breakfaat
and clambake as an additional ineentfve
toward a large attendance.
The directors of the Olympic Gun Club
have found it necessary to abandon their
deer and duck preserves. It was found
that the club could not provide all it3
members with this luxury for $2 a month.
It withdraw* ftpm thru pariicular field
now rather than make a complete failuro
some months hence. The directors de
cided that private individuals wl'h un
limited means coul'l do on a small scala
what the club could not possibly do for
its large membership. Preserves without
ducks were useless, and to attract duck*
meant the baiting of ponds and other ex
pensive improvements. A number of
members of the club are prepared to taka
over the preserves for their private shoot
ing and have organized a club for the pur
pose.
The Olympic men will smash bluerocka
at Ingleside to-morrow, while the San

The Pyramid Pile Cure Is tSe safest
and surest pile cure on the market, be-
cause it contains no mineral poisons nor
opium nor cocaine, but can be used with
absolute safety and certainty of cure.
Many physicians are now usins tha
Pyramid Pile Cure In place of surgical
operations, belnp painless, .convenient to
use, and the patient can attend to hl3
daily occupation while the cure is beir.sj
made, as it is used at night and no addi-
tional treatment is necessary.
Dr. Wharton says the Pyramid PileCura
will prove a blessing to mankind, when It
is remembered 'that heretofore a surgical
operation- was considered the only cure
with all its danger to life. Intense pain
and an expense of from ten to one hun-
dred dollars, to say nothing of the possi-
ble return of the trouble. The Pyramid,
Pile Cure costs but fifty cents at any drug
store and does the work quickly and
safely.

SALINAS, May 25.â The final session of
the California Grand Lodge, Knights of

have attended it to be one of the most no

The festivities, as well as the lodge work
of the week, have been well nigh contin

to their respective homes to-morrow
rather tired but none the less pleased with
all that has been done for them by the
hospitable people of Salinas.
A few delegates went away to-day, but
by far the greater number stayed- over

The scene at Armory Hall to-night, wher*
the grand ball was held, was brilliant In
the extreme, the dress uniforms of the
Uniform Rank Knights and the elegant
gowns of the ladles combining to make
a very picturesque ensemble. Rawllng's
orchestra of this city furnished the
music for the dances.

SACRAMENTO, May 25.â The Grand
Jury, which has been in session In this
county at intervals for several months,
late this afternoon returned a report criti
cizing in several respects the conduct of;
county business and bringing formal ac
cusation against William Curtis, chair
man of the Board of Supervisors.
The accusation Is based on the action of
Chairman Curtis In personally proceeding
in the matter of having repairs made to a
bridge at Orangevale under what the
Grand Jury claims was the unwarranted
assumption that the repairs constituted an
emergency requiring immediate attention.
The Grand Jury finds that the condition
of emergency did not actually exist and
that the action should not have been
taken without a notice to contractors and
the award of the work to the lowest bid
der, In compliance with the county gov
ernment act. The District Attorney J*
directed to press the accusation In the
courts.
The city prison is declared to be unsafe
for further use. The report condemns the
practice of "floating'* the petty offenders
out of town by withholding Judgments of
conviction, to become a burden and terror
to the rural population.
Friends of Supervisor Curtis, who comes
from a country district, assert that the
other Supervisors who authorized his ac
tion In the bridge matter should have
been held by the Grand Jury equally re
sponsible with him If tho action were In
fact illegal. They also claim that Curtis
Is an usplrant for re-election and that the
Grand Jury contained three rival candi
dates from the same district.

General Conference Protests to Con

CHICAGO. May 25.â "With but four ex
ceptions the Methodist General Confer
ence to-day elected to serve during the
next quadrennial all the secretaries and
assistant secretaries of the church benev
olences and the editors of the various
official church papers, present officers be
ing in most instances re-elected. The ex
ceptions were one secretary of the Freed
men's Aid and Southern Education So
ciety, the assistant secretary of the Mis
sionary Society and editors of the Central
and Western Christian Advocates. Tho
conference also took up for final dispo
sition the report of the committee on the
state of the church In regard to the at
titude of the Methodist church on card
playing, theater-going and other prohib
ited amusements and the prospects appear
favorable for an exceedingly lively debate
on the subject to-morrow before It is
finally disposed of. The majority report
as presented by Governor Pattlson of
Pennsylvania favors the removal from
the penal code of the book of discipline of
the matter bearing on this subject and
placing it in the advisory. The minority
report favors no action. Many of the best
debaters of the great Methodist body have
announced their Intention of speaking on
the subject.
The committee on state of the church
recommended that no action be taken in
regard to the licensing of women as
preachers and this was approved by the
conference to-day.
A formal protest against the taxation
of legacies to charitable, educational and
religious institutions was made to Con
gress. The protest, which was introduced
by W. J. Welch of the Wyoming Confer
ence, characterizes such taxation as "con
trarv to public policy, and as practically
taxing directly the Institutions which do
most to aid the government and benefit
tjhe people, and is. in fact, taking money
dedicated to public uses."
The conference refused to reverse the
action of the Colorado Conference in tho
case of J. K. I'assmore. who was expelled
from the church and deposed from the
ministry, charged with making bitter at
tacks on ministers and bishops of the
church.
At the afternoon session the result of
th<> balloting for secretaries and assistant
secretaries of the church benevolent so
cieties and for the editors of the various
ofHcial church publications was an
nounced as follows:

ST. LOUIS, May 25.â The most impor
tant features of the afternoon session of
the Presbyterian General Assembly was
the bobbing up again of the Peoria over
ture, which was thought to have been
given a rest by adoption at the morning
session and the appointment of tho creed
revision committee. One of the Xew
York commissioners offered two amend
ments as substitutes to the sections of
the Peoria overture, which provide for
the. number of members of the standing
committees and the appointment of chair
men. The substitutes provide that an ad
ditional member shall be on each commit
tee and that the moderator shall appoint
the chairmen of the committees, j Ac
tion will bo taken on the amendments
before nnal adjournment of the assem
bly.
The greater part of the afternoon was
occupied by reports of committees. Dur
ing the discussion of the report from
the committee on temperance, Kev. Hugh
Lamont of the Presbytery of Puget
Bound offered an amendment protesting
against the existence by official permis
sion of liduor selling in the canteens of
the army of the United States.
This caused a heated debate. The com
mittee had announced that It had aimed
to draw up a temperate report and be
cause a canteen section was in the report
made by the committee last year no allu
sion was made to it in this year's report.
The standing committee rested on the
declaration that "while deploring the ex
istence and the evils of traffic in Intoxi
cating liquors in all parts of the United
States, we heartily commend the efforts
of the Government to suppress Intemper
ance, and urge that the Immoral traffic
be restrained and as rapidly as possible
be abolished by all legitimate means in
all places under the Jurisdiction of the
United States."
Dr. Laraont's amendment was adopted.
Moderator Dickey named the following
ministers and elders as members of the
creed revision committee:
Drs. Herrick Johnson of Illinois, S. O.
Nicholls of Missouri, D. W. Fisher of In
diana, George B. Stewart of New York.
William McKibben of Pennsylvania,

PACIFIC GROVE. May 25.â The con
ference cf Pacific Coast students,
which opened in this city to-night,
is the fifth annual gathering of col
lege men on the coast, and is one
cf the largest as well as most im
portant meetings yet held. Men are here
from all parts of the Pacific slope, all the
leading universities and colleges of Cali

Idaho and Utah, representing a greater,
number of institutions than have ever be

the University of Nevada, Berkeley lead-

delegation.
During the past few years these sum

gained po high a place In the estimation
of students throughout the United States
that the student bodies of all the Insti

more to see their Importance as a means
of carrying forward the best phases of

delegations are sent and more colleges are

conferences held In the United States.
Normal schools are also falling Into the

bas3ball and footbnll'- tournaments are
well known upon intercollegiate fields,

the students arc thus kept In condition
for the harder and more eerlous work of
tho morning and evening.
The delegates are housed In the Pacific
Improvement Company's cottages and
El Carmelo Hotel, and these quiet sur

many college men. suddenly awakened
into the busy, breezy life of a college

General Young's Report.
WASHINGTON. May 25.â The second
installment or General S. M. Ii. Young's
report upon his operations In the Philip
pines was made public at the War De
partment to-uay. It aeals with the pur
suit of Aguinaldo throughout Northern
Luzon, the release of the Spanish prison
ers in the hands of the Filipinos and the
recapture of Lieutenant Gumore ol the
Navy and his party.
On the 17th of November last General
Young wired General Otis from PosorruD
bio'to the effect that Agulnaldo was a fu
gitive, seeking escape to me mountains
or by sea, ana immediately set out In hot
pursuit. The chase was a close and ex
citing one and at times the Filipino chief
tain was dangerously mar capture. Agui
naldo and Tinio, alter being pursued re
lentlessly as far as Cangon, separated, the
former making for Lepunto by the moun
tain trail ana the latter going north to
defend tho pass in tho Tangadan Moun
tains. Major March was thereupon dis
patched with his battalion of the Thirty
third Volunteer Infantry to continue the
chase after Agulnaldo, while General
Young prepared to attack the Tangadan
Pass, which Tinio boasted would never be
taken by American troops. After a spirit
ed engagement. In which Colonels Hare.
Thirty-tnird Infantry, and Howse, Thirty
fourth Infantry, were conspicuous, able
and daring, Tinio's prediction was set at
naught and by nightfall on December 4
a clever detour by a Hanking party into
the mountains to gain the rear of the
enemy had Its effect and Tinio was again
in full retreat. Meanwhile Major March,
in pursuit of Aguinaldo, had met and
routed General Gregario del Pilar's forces
in the Tila Pass, General Pilar receiving
his death wound in this engagement.
Continuing as to the further pursuit and
final recapture of both American and
bpanish prisoners the report says:
Tlnlo used every device he was capable of
to mislead the troop9 and cover the trail of
the prisoners he had, who had been sent on
with & force of two officers and ISO men as
a special guard. At this Juncture Lieutenant
Hayes, of General Young's Btuff, received the
surrender of Major Xatividad. from whom
much valuable information was obtained.
Leaving Captain Rollls with eighty foot-sore
and shoeless men from the two commands to
guard the mouth of the canyon against the
forces of Tlnlo and Xatividad. those iron
nerved officers. Hare and Howse, who had
consolidated their forces of Â«-gually daring
men. pushed on with fierce determination to
overtake the prisoners and. their guard.
There Is sufficient evidence to show that
Tlnlo had jriven orders that prisoners falling
out from exhaustion should be bayoneted.
From time to time unmistakable evidence of
the presence of the prisoners was found along
the trail and acted as an additional incentive
to both officers and men to redouble their ef
forts to overtake their unfortunate country
men. About 4 p. m. on the 16th a signal from
the advance guard warned them that they were
In the presence of a possible enemy. A recon
noi&sance developed a party of insurgents, and
In the rush five of their number were killed
and ten taken prisoners. 'With this detachment
were McDonald, Fitzgerald and Farley. Ameri
can prisoners who were recaptured. Lieutenant
Gilmore had leit the place with the rest ot
the prisoners early that morning, but when
overtaken the following day. the 17th, had
been abandoned by hla guard, who had learned
ot the proximity of the pursuing forces.
On the 17th of December, General Concepclon
and staff, consisting of five officers and six
enlisted men. were captured by Major March.
On January 1 ARulnaldo's wife and sister, two
sisters of Colonel Leyba, wife of Colonel
Sltayer. the wife of Lieutenant Cristobal.
Colonel Sltayer. Lieutenant Colonel Paez, three
offlcera of lef-ser rank and ten or twelve ser
vants, all belonging to the retinue of Aguln
aldo, were sent in by March.
Then follows the first official mention
of the exploit of Second Lieutenant Mun
roe of the Fourth Cavalry, who while in
command of a small detachment tele
graphed -Into Bayombong that he was ap
proaching the town in large force and de
manding tho surrender of the place. The
ruse was successful and the vastly supe
rior forces of the enemy laid down their
arms. Continuing the report says:
Castncr's Long March.
Lieutenant Castner. with his detachment of
IxDwe's scouts, marched on Bayombong, where
lie found Second Lieutenant Munroe of the
Fourth Cavalry In command of a small de
tachment, negotiating for the surrender of the
place. Lieutenant Castner generously deferred
to Lieutenant Munroe and allowed him to re
ceive the surrender of General Canon, his
aids and the forces garrisoning the town. In
this connection It may be stated that the
march of Lieutenant Castner's detachment,
covering a period from November 10 to De
cember 21. la one of the most remarkable on
record, and It is probably the longest con
tinuous march made during the Insurrection. !
.Captain McCalla of the United States navy
received the surrender of General Tlrona and
the .Insurgent forces In the province of Caya- '
gan at Aparri.
On January 5 Lieutenant Gilmore and the
recaptured prisoners arrived at Vigan. At
San Icldro the first Spanish prisoners Joined the
column and from then on others at almost every
town through which tho troops passed. The
advance was so rapid that It was not possible
to make lists at all places, but It Is believed
that the total number of Spanish prisoners
released by the command was 4000.
In conclusion General Young extends
his thanks to the officers and men of the
navy for their cordial support and of the
troops of his command, and says:
They clung to the main purposes for which
the campaign was Inaugurated and pursued
the course laid out for them with a tenacity
of purpose and a physical endurance which
1 think, far exceeded the highest expectation
or belief of their country as they certainly
did that of thPlr general.

There you have it in a nutshell. Generosity for the
Boers, patriotism for Georgia and money for the rail
roads. What more can be expected of hospitality?
The Boer Commissioners should go to Atlanta, and
spy out the land. It is too late for 'possums and too
early for sweet potatoes, but rice birds are ripe and
watermelons are about due. They will find any
where from the Cherokee Ridge to the swampy isl
ands of the coast fruitful sites for the location of
happy homes, and old Oom Paul could not do better
than remove his mighty family there and teach his
great-grandchildren how to run for office.
Having thus explained the situation the Constitu
tion, with a glow of enthusiasm worthy of the gifted
Grady, says: "Here's a chance for Governor Nor
then and for the railroad companies of Georgia. Will
they send at once a delegation to Pretoria and make
known the claims of Georgia, that she offers them
freedom, liberty of conscience and land which will
yield to them every return for their labor? Send
upon this commission a couple of our sturdy Salz
burger citizens, who, standing eye to eye with their
brethren across the sea, can assure them of a welcome
which has some heart in it. The suggestion is one
which should be taken up by those who are inter
ested in the development of business resources. There
will be money in it for the railroads, as well as pa
triotism in it on the part of the State."
The offer was made originally, we believe, by an
immigration agent, but the Atlanta Constitution has
taken it up and extended it in the name of all Geor
gians. Our contemporary declares the Boers are of
the same kind of men "who in the^Salzburgers formed
one of the sturdiest and strongest strains of original
Georgia colonization," and that being now sur
rounded by forces "which doom them either to immi
gration or to subjugation to a race which has proved
their enemy from the first, thousands of them have
declared that rather than accept the alternative they
will pack up their household goods and seek 'new
homes under happier auspices."
SOUTHERN hospitality comes to the front with
an offer of homes and fortunes for the Boers.
From that section of the Union there has been
issued a cordial invitation to all the valiant men and
women of Dutch or Huguenot blood in South Africa
to come to the Southern States and find refuge from
British tyranny.
A WELCOME FOR THE BOERS.
A grand bazaar opened in London for the purpose
of raising money for the relief of British sufferers by
the war in South Africa netted $50,000 on the first
day: but in the meantime the relief fund for the
starving people of India languishes at a mark far
below what is needed. Evidently the spirit of war
relaxes the purse strings a good deal quicker than
humanity can do it.
Summing up the conditions and prospects of the
; famine districts the correspondent of the London
j Chronicle says: "Given fair season the Indian
i peasantry recover from the effects of famine with a
Â¦ rapidity little short of marvelous, but two conditions
will this year test their recuperative power to an un
usual degree. The first of these, a fact which cannot
be too often insisted upon, is the occurrence' of a sec
ond drought before the traces of the previous one
j had been eliminated; the second, the unprecedented
j mortality among the cattle. Millions of acres in
j Guzerat and Rajputana will lie fallow next season
j from the lack of means to plow the soil. On a san
[ guine estimate six years must elapse before the centra]
: The monetary loss caused by the drought is enor
! mous. The net cost to the Government, counting
! the diminution in the revenues and the increase in
j expenses for relief, has already exceeded $50,000,000.
] It is estimated the people have lost $75,000,000 on
! their food crops and $35,000,000 on their cotton crop.
j Even more serious, however, is the loss of cattle, for
I that means not only the loss of the value of the cattle
themselves, but a loss of ahility to plow and sow the
fields when the rains come. Millions of oxen have
perished, and in wide stretches of country it is said
upward of 00. per cent of the cattle have been swept
i out of existence.
It is to be noted, moreover, that the figures cited
do not give the full measure of the horror of the
situation. They show the extent but not the intensity
of the famine. The London Chronicle says: "The
great feature which distinguishes the present famine
from all which preceded it is not the unprecedented
area and number of people brought under its in
fluence, but the circumstance that it follows hot upon
the footsteps of a period of unequaled scarcity. This
has shaken the self-reliance of the peasantry, and
broken down the feeling of repugnance to accept Gov
ernment aid to an alarming extent. Formerly the
sturdy ryot. or Petty land-owner, regarded the relief
works with much the same kind of dislike that the
British poor entertain for the workhouse, but this
prejudice has given away under the severity of the
strain. Familiarity with famine has brought in its
train familiarity with the idea of state aid; the relief
works in some centers are crowded with a class of
landowners who have never previously sought aid."
THE FAMINE IN IND10.
WITH each successive report from India the
story of the great famine becomes more and
more appalling. It is by far the greatest calam
ity that has befallen that country since the beginning
of the century. In August, 1877. just before the
drought of that year broke up, the total area affected
was 250,000 square miles, with a population of 58,000,
000. The famine of ten years later, when at its
worst, blighted a district of 303,000 square miles,
with a population of 62,000,000. The drought
of this year is not expected to break before
August, and yet it has already affected a region
containing 445.000 square miles, containing a
population of 90,000,000. Lord George Hamilton
stated in Parliament last Thursday that slight showers
had fallen in some parts of the affected district, but
that nothing but the monsoons could benefit the
country, so parched is it at present. Thus the
suffering must increase rather than diminish for
some time to come, end it is impossible as yet to set
the bounds the calamity will reach.

It is fair to assume the sentiments of the statesman
who ieads the Conservative party of his fellow coun
trymen are widely shared, and therefore if the Aus
tralians stand out against the Chamberlain plan they
will have a strong support among the Canadians. 1
Such being the feeling in the two colonies, it is clear
that imperial federation will have to wait.
Speaking for himself, he is quoted as saying: "So
far as my life and my opinion go I would never con
sent that England herself or any other country in the
world should ever be empowered to impose a dollar of
taxation on the people of Canada. We are a free coun
try and we have conceded to us the entire manage
ment of our own affairs. At the same tirrie. whenever
the interests of the British empire should be at stake
Canada would be found ready in the future, as she
bns been in the past, to do her duty without any com
pulsion whatever."
The Canadian protest comes from no less a per
son that Sir Charles Tupper. leader of the Canadian
Conservative?. In the course of a recent address on
the past, present and future of Canada Sir Charles
decbred the federation scheme would be of advantage
to neither Great Britain nor Canada. It is only a
question of time, he said, when Canada, Australia and
South Africa will contain a larger population than
Great Britain. When that day comes, if the federal
scheme be carried out. Great Britain will find herself
overruled on imperial issues by the representatives
of colonies lying far from Europe and but slightly
Efircted by conditions on that continent which might
menace every interest of Great Britain itself. Federa
tion under such circumstances would be injurious to
the mother country, z.tid in the meantime so long as
the British are strong enough to control the empire
the colonies would suffer by the federation.
Looking at the question from a Canadian point of
view. Sir Charles pointed out that in the existing
situation Canada's military and naval expenses, aug
mented as they have been by contributions to the
South African war. r.mount to about $46,000,000.
U'hile Scotland, with a smaller population than Can
.nda. has had to pay upward of $70,000,000, and he
expressed the belief that very few intelligent Cana
dians would be willing to change the present status of
Canada for that of Scotland in the empire.
The plan, it will be seen, affects Canada, India 'and
South Africa as well as Australia, and therefore the
statesmen of those colonies will have to be consulted
r.pon it. As the people of India have little or no
voice in the management of their affairs, the desires
of the Ministry will of course be acceded to in that
colony. South Africa at present is not in a situation
to act with much more independence than India. In
Canada, however, the sentiment of the people will
determine what the Government does, and already
there has arisen in that colony a voice of protest
against the Chamberlain scheme.
BY way of inducing the Australians to so amend
their federal constitution as to admit of appeals
from the Federal Court to the Privy Council
Secretary Chamberlain has promised on the part of
the imperial Government to admit Australia, Canada,
South Africa and India to representation in the
Council. Should his plan be accepted and carried out
the Privy Council would then constitute the nucleus
of a governing body lor the much discussed imperial
federation, and woul.i go a long way toward bring
irg about closer relaticns between Great Britain and
her colonies.

The enterprise displayed by the people of Kansas
City in this emergency is of a kind that our people
delight to honor. It is one of the chief factors in our
industrial and commercial successes. American
bridges were furnished to the British army in the
Soudan because the Americans contracted to get
them to the place where, they were wanted at the
time they were wanted, while British and other con
tractors would not undertake to do so. It is a little
curious that the Bryanite hosts when they meet to
denounce American manufacturers and capitalists and
to howl calamity will have in the hall itself an'evi
dence of the value of the things they condemn. If
they seek a monument of American prosperity they
have only to look around them.
The work has been carried on under serious ob
stacles, for the labor troubles and strikes in St. Louis
and Chicago have had more or less effect in Kansas
City, and it is said a number of agitators have tried
to induce the workingmen there to profit by the
emergency to strike for favors. Moreover, the high
est prices have had to be paid for all material used
ir. the construction of the new edifice. A recent re
port says: "The convention hall committee to se
cure the structural steel for the hall was forced to
pay about $30,000 more than it cost in the original
building, owing to the fact that the market was at the
highest notch just at the time the contract was made.
It has gone down considerably since then, but all
material was bought at the high figure. In addition
to this a bonus of $9000 had to be paid 'to the Car
negie Company to have the roof trusses ready in
time."
The expense of course has been great. At the time
the bid was made for the convention it was believed
$100,000 would cover all the expenses assumed by the
city, including the $50,000 guaranteed to the national
committee. It is now said to be evident, however,
that the city will have to stand an expense of $250,000
to have things in readiness in July, and, furthermore,
that sum includes only the direct outlay.
J /OANSAS CITY did not add anything to her pres
|\ tige or to the repute of her people for good
Â¦ sound sense when she and they pledged $50,000
to the Democratic National Convention in return tor
the honor and profits of entertaining it. Therefore,
when the hall in which it was intended the convention
should assemble burned down there was no particular
attention given to the subject outside of'the city her
self, except in Minneapolis, where a prompt offer was
made to take the convention off the hands of Kansas
City and thus save her people from embarrassment.
Just now, however, Kansas City is winning praise
from all parts of the Union, and deserving it, too, for
the vim and vigor with which her people have gone
to work to have a hall ready for the convention show
characteristics which we are fond of regarding a3
typically American, and which certainly are not
equaled by any other people on the globe.
To the offer of Minneapolis to take the convention
a prompt reply was sent that Kansas City had no con
ventions to spare. Before the flames which destroyed
the big hall died away amid the ashes money had
been subscribed to erect another and a better edifice
in its place. Plans were drawn for a structure de
signed especially for convention purposes, and it is
now said the Democratic gathering will be better
provided for than any other national assembly of the
kind in the history of the country.

Southside citizens have emphatically protested
against the transformation of Columbia square into a
children's playground. The small boy individually is
fearfully and wonderfully made, but in numbers, in
one locality, he is competent to put an army to flight.
As The Call pointed out some time ago, the people
of the Eastern cities were prompt in taking steps to
assure a full count of the population of their com
munities, and we may be sure that hardly a single
name will be missed in. the count of those cities which
are our rivals for rank in the Union. It behooves our
people, therefore, to be equally vigilant and public
spirited in assisting the census officials to get a full
count in San Francisco. California is a holiday land,
and perhaps a larger proportion of the inhabitants of
this city go to the woods or seashore for vacation
than of any other community of similar size in the
Union. It is certain that a very large number of our
people will be out of town during the first two weeks
of June, and the danger of a much smaller showing
in the census than we are entitled to is consequently
imminent. The Census Bureau has provided a way
to guard against the danger, and it now rests with
the absentees themselves to follow the instructions
?nd assure the counting of their names.
It is to be hoped the request will be complied with
universally, and that not a single inhabitant of San
Francisco will be lost from the enumeration when
the count is complete. The matter is one of impor
tance to the community in many ways. In the first
place, since representation is based for ten years upon
the records of the census, the political prestige of the
city depends upon the accuracy of the count. In the
second place, since capitalists seek growing and vig
orous communities in which to invest capital, and
enterprising young men choose such places when
selecting a home for life, it is evident the prosperity
of the community will be largely dependent upon the
showing made by the census of growth during the
last decade.
"In all cases of contemplated absence the head of
the family is requested by the Census Oflke to com
municate with the Supervisor of the district in which
he lives. He is also requested to leave information
regarding his answers to the questions which are to
be asked with some responsible neighbor who will
agree to see that it reaches the enumerator on his
rounds. Such information might better be left as
a memorandum in writing, as in that case it is less
likely to be overlooked. The questions to which
answers are desired apply primarily to the population,
hut also to all farms and manufacturing establish
ments. They are being published from time to time
in the press of the country. By taking this trouble
the absent citizen will do justice to his locality and his
State, and materially aid the Census Office in the
performance of its duties."
The means by which absentees may assure the
counting of their names in the population of the city
Â«re thus set forth in the circular:
rROM the Census Bureau there has been issued
a circular directing attention to the fact th'at the
enumeration of the people is to be made during
the month of June, and that within the cities it is in
tended the count of population shall be made within
two weeks, beginning with the first of the month.
As the people are to be counted at their place of resi
dence, and as many city people leave home in June
for the summer vacation, there is danger a good many
may be overlooked. To guard against that the circu
lar has been issued, urging all persons who are going
away from home to take precautions to have their
names enrolled.
THE PEOPLE AND THE CENSUS
It is a much observed fact that man's
general speech Is colored particularly by
the profession or occupation in which he
Is engaged. The following la a conversa
tion which adds Its Instance of proof to
the general law:
E. O. McCormick, passenger traffic
manager of the Southern Pacific, and G.
M. Richardson, master of transportation
of the rame beneficent family, meet on the
steps of the yellow building-.
McCormick (hand extended) â Hello.
Rich, how are you?
Richardsonâ Oh. pretty well. How are
you. Mac?
McCormick (still grasping) â Not so
good. My throat Is sore. Need a drink.
I guess. Not enough traffic for the road.
Richard3onâ Reverse throttle, Mac. You
mean that there has been more traffic
than the road would bear.
Then there was a parting of the ways.
"Anyhow," said Belasco afterward. "I'll
have a nice feed in the morning for my
chickens."
McCopmlck Has a Sore Throat
A theater party at the Alcazar intro
duced a new wrinkle last night an.! hai
Doorkeeper Henry Belasco so bailiy rat
tled for a few minutes that some small
boys managed to slip past him before ha
could recover himself. There were about
twenty young folks in the party. They
arrived just when the crowd was thickest,
floating out of a bunch of hacks and
alighting upon Belasco like a cloud with
a deafening rustle of silk skirts ami daz
zling display of glistening white shirt
fronts. The leader of the party thrust
a biscuit into the outstretched hand of
the ticket-taker and brushed by him into
the theater. Before the astonished ticket
taker could recover from surprise suffi
ciently to speak he had a whole armful
of biscuits and buns.
"Bâ bâ bâ but where's the tickets?" ha
finally managed to stammer.
"Why, inside of the buns." was tha
laughing reply Â» of the last man a3 ho
slipped Into the door. And so it proved.
The crowd that had enjoyed the door
keeper's discomfiture had to stand out
side and wait until Belasco had r.roken
open all the buns and extracted from
them the tickets.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for the opinions published In this column, but
presents them for whatever value they may have as communications of e*neral Interest.
To the Honorable State Boarrl of Tradeâ Gentlemen: The attention of the un
dersigned was directed to an editorial In the San Francisco Call under date of May
14 or 15 in relation to unsurveyed lands In California. The article referred to Is
timely and a step In the right direction, and It asks that citizens who are cognizant
of facts relative to the subject make them known. We are deeply Interested In
the subject und beg to present the following? facts: i
. In the redwood belt In Mendoelno County there are seven and one-half sections
of land, all In township 13 north, range 16 west, that were surveyed a number of
years ago, but the survey was rejected. Immediately after the survey we, the un
dersigned, and a number of others located claims, built houses and In some in
stances set out orchards, built fences, made roads and other Improvements neces
sary for a permanent residence.
The survey being rejected, we were debarred from cutting timber, peeling bark
or engaging in any business on our places whereby we could earn a living, conse
quently could not keep our families thereon. We have complied with the require
ments of the law relative to claims, and have visited ours at least once a month
and remained one or two nights each time.
A short time ago we learned that a party named F. M. -Hyde of San Francisco
had plastered a scrip (obtained in exchange for-Mand in Nevada, which Congress
had converted Into a reservation of some kind) v upon our land, no notice of any
kind having bf en given that the land had been put on the market.
Another singular fact in* connection with filing or plastering the scrip on our
claims is that our cabins have been burned, fences destroyed and many of the Im
provements demolished. A few weeks ago six houses and cabins were burned
within a period of a few days. We have forwarded a petition to Hon. J. A. Bar
ham, member of Congress, at Washington, detailing the facts arrd asking hl3 ad
vice and assistance in dealing with this glaring fraud.
We are citizens and taxpayers of Mendocino County and can substantiate all
of the assertions made, and we will gladly furnish any and all details. Trusting
that you may do something toward assisting us and others in getting our legal
rights, we remain, yours very respectfully,

The footpad and burglar who pleaded guilty the
other day had at least one saving grace. He was thor
oughly convinced of his own worthlessness and had
the sympathy of the public in his conviction.
Some of the Supervisors are of the opinion that if
the officers of the telephone company were arrcstd
every day for violating the local licence law the city
would still net get its dues. Somebody must have
been revealing that business principle of the monop
oly that it is better to be in jail and not pay your
debts rather than out of jail and be honest.
The failure of the big firm of Price, McCormick &
Co. in an effort to bull cotton beyond the point to
which the genera! prosperity of the country carried
it is another warning to the sanguine not to overdo
things. This is a bul! country and a bull year, but
all the same there ire limits beyond which a bull
cannot toss a bear even when he has both horns

Police.
' Captain of Detectives Seymour and his
men are still searching for the Rhouis

night In an Intoxicated condition and fall-
Ing to find the watchman he flred a shot

GHOULS OF CALVARY
ARE STILL AT LARGE
gives me great satisfaction. Here, 3500
miles from where Is his Excellency's
liomti and many thousands of miles more
from Rome â here, in this far away city, a
Catholic Truth Society iÂ« nourishing, ex
panding and carrying that universal truth
which is in the custody of him who sends
to you an apostolic delegate. And his
Kxcellency has seen and heard enough to
know to-night that here, as elsewhere.
Catholic truth is thriving. He has seen
much of men and has traveled much, and
knows that Catholic truth is a shining
light perpetually. Travel wherever you
may, a Catholic spire and a Catholic cross
are telling of that truth which in unpol
luted stream flows from Rome. It is a
matter of gratification to me also that to
night we shall hear of him who rules on
the papal throne. I give way to Mr.
Adanif." â¢Â¦ -Â¦
â¢Hearty applause erected the closing
words of the speaker and welcomed the
lecturer of the evening, Henry Austin Ad
ams, who spoke at length on Leo XIII.
Mr. Adams sought to tix the place of Pope
I^eo in the thought and progress of the
age, to detlne the spiritual and intellect
ual relations between the pontiff and the
people he rules and to appeal for that
principle of synthesis In thought, religion
and morals which Leo XIII represents in
opposition to the intellectual anarchy of
analysis which unrest and unbelief are
using to destroy institutions and systems.
While the lecture was neither the best
nor the most characteristic which Mr.
Adams has delivered In this city. It was
thoughtful and eloquent enough to win
the attention of his hearers and the re
ward of their applause.
As a preliminary to his discussion of
Leo XIII, the speaker traced the inci
dents and world comments which accom
panied the death of Pope Pius IX. The
non-Catholic world, the speaker said,
predicted that with the century the
Papacy would die. the church of Rome
had seen its last Pope and that if another
sat on the Papal throne he would- be but
the ghost of greatness, the shell but not
the substance of power. New thoughts
were agitating the world, they said, and
new problems, with which no Pope could
deal, were demanding attention. The
doom of the Papacy, the doubters said,
was at hand. They did not know that
men come and they go. Popes live and
die, but the Papacy lives forever upon
the everlasting rock of Peter.
It is an intellectual age, they said, or
what was worse, they thought it to be,
but forgot that with the times comes the
man to meet the times and as successor
to Pius IX came Leo XIII, the sreatest
Pope of the century, the great, cen
tral, Inspiring figure of the intellectual
and spiritual world. Into this swirling,
restless age of spiritual anarchy the
calm, guiding genius of Leo has entered
to combat the acid of analysis, the soph
istries of false logic, the snares of Im
perfect information. Into this world
Pope Leo has come to lead men away
from the foe banks of yearning and dis"
quiet and the ocean of doubt and despair
into the foothills of faith and thence to
those spiritual fastnesses where reigns
the peace and goodness of God.
To the Intellectual world, he said, Leo
has been a liberal Pope. He has fostered
the learning of men. He has opened the
â¢ treasures of the Vatican to the inquiring,
i Incredulous glance of the world, for he
knows that nothing of truth can harm the
stupendous, awe-inspliing fabric of which
he is the keystone. Those that hate the
truth he teaches love him, f^r he has
lighted the lamp of synthesis In the dark
ness of an analytic age. He. has given to
?p^ciallzation its proper peace, but that
which solidifies, which deepens, which
quiets the thought of man has a greater
I and a nobler place.
And then, said the sneaker. Pope Leo
must be seen In his relation to the Scrip
tures. He must be known in his battling
I against the most Insidious enemy of all
: faiths and all creedsâ that unbelief which
I is undermining the earnest, sacred truths
of the Bible. When, millions of souls aro
nfioat on the ocean of doubt they will see
the rock of Peter and upon It find refuge.
And can we forget him. said the lec
turer, in his contact with the painful
pulsating work world where men laboi'
and suffer against the power of greed
and lust and Jealousy? It has been told
cf him that he has said the only sane
thing that has ever been snid In all po
litical economy and the world Is bettei
and purer and happier because ho, has
Faid that In the brotherhood of man will
we find the solution to the fearful prob
lems that threaten to wreck the world
And in Leo XIII the Catholics of America
see a light from heaven, a pillar of fire a
man in the glorious fulfillment of his high
destiny. * '
speech and spt-aktr became only incidents
in a celebration in which the Papal leg
ate remained the central and most con
spicuous figure. In. his honor the secre
tary of the apostolic delegation at Wash,
ington. the \ ery Itev. Dr. F. Z. Rooker,
was made president of the evening.
In opening the meeting the Kev. Philip
O'Hyuu said that the Catholic Truth So
ciety felt deeply grateful that the official
representative of Leo XIII in the Unltea
States had honored the society with his
presence. The distinguished prelate, hÂ«
said, had come opportunely to hear from
an eloquent lecturer words of praise of
the glorious pontiff who now sits In th*
chair of St. Peter. With these words
Lt'Hyan introduced the Very Rev. Dr.
RooKer as chairman of the evening.
Dr. Rooker spoke at some length, con
gratulating his hearers on the spirit they
showed in their faith and in the fidelity
inÂ«-y Moved to Catholic truth. In both
spirit and fidelity he found another grrati
tylne oxamplf ot thi- worid-wiiio Tact that
in every community around the world a
Catholic spire and a Catholic crows herald
the living and everlasting truth whpae
perpetual fountain is in Home.
"1 suppose," he paid Jocularly," "that
Father O'Ryun expects me to give than.ta
for being eho?en to preside to-night, but
if I entertained a thought of doing so
I will give it no expression. Whatever
light there may be comi'iR from me Is
a reflected light from the prelate who is
the actual president to-niyht and whose
proxy I am. I suppose, too, that I am
expected, as well as is his Excellency,
Monsignor Martlnelll, to express astonish
ment at your wonderful development In
this city and on this cojtst. I have watched
his Kxcellency's face, but it has betrayed
no sign of astonishment; neither has
mine. We are gratined, Indeed, but not
astonished. There Is no reason in the
world why you should not have made the
splendid progress which is now to your
credit.
"Are not the men who made this city
inspired by the same sentiment, the sime
blood, the* same ppirlt ap were those men
who have built every American city?
If success rewarded striving and stress
of endeavor in the East, why not in the
West? What you have done Is greatly to
your credit. But we are not astonished;
we expected it.
"Of the many things which have struck
me on my visit here one in particular
ing a splendid tribute to the reigning
Pope in the presence of Leo's personal
representative In the United States, and
to one of the largest audiences ever gath
ered in Metropolitan Hall. Deeply sig
nincant as the tb-me was and eloquent
as the speaker has proved himself to be.
Grand Jury Formally Charges the
Man Who Bobbed the Crocker
Residence.
The Grand Jury returned an indictment
yesterday against John P. Hill, formerly
butler at the Crocker residence at Bur
llngume, who took, it is alleged. $3500
worth of diamonds belonging to Mrs. A.
M. Easton, a guest in the house, and
fled the country after selling the jewels In
this city for $310. The indictment charges
Hill with bringing stolen property into San
Francisco and fixes his bail at $10,000. As
no trace of Hill has ever been found and
as the stolen Jewelry "has been returned
to the owner it is not likely that the mat
ter will ever be heard of again.
Attorneys J. S. Mitchell and James Na
gle were before the- Grand Jury to ex
plain their connection with the case of
M Eckenkell. the street car man. who
lost a suit for damages against the Sut
ter-street Railway Company and now
wants to Indict his attorneys for alleged
confiscation of $114 put up as fees in the
case. Attorney Nagle showed that they
had acted honorably in the matter and
the case was dropped.
SIGNIFICANT of the marvelous
strides of Western civilization was
the business transacted yesterday
by the State Sportsmen's Conven
tion at the Olympic Gun Club's rooms.
Fhe trend of action was to pass sweep-
Ing restrictions, almost reaching prohi-
Dltion. upon the. killing of wild birds and
quadrupeds. Members of the gathering,
still young, could remember when these
low scattered denizens of forest and field
?xisted almost in primeval plenty and
?ould be killed with ruthless Indiscrimi
nation, So rapidly has man encroached
upon the reign of nature that sportsmen
tire fearful lest the valued birds and
beasts be entirely exterminated, and
hence this convention, marking an era in
California's history.
Some slight friction between urban and
suburban interests was noticeablo yester
day, but the general desire was to pro
pose laws that would be satisfactory to
all sections arid not meet with opposition
in the Legislature by which it is hoped
they will be adopted.
From the talk It Is evident that the
main discussion before the convention
when It reconvenes at 10 o'clock this
morning will be on the "possessory
clause" relating to birds. How sports
men can be prevented from having more
than a certain number in their possession
at once, and dealers, hotels and restaur
unts can be accommodated in the mat
ter of keeping quantities on hand, will
probably arouse an argument bordering
on a light.
The report of the resolution committee
on open and closed seasons was awaited
with expectation. It provides that black
brant wild duck, rull. Knglish or Wilson
snipe, curlew, ibis or plover may be
killed during any three -consecutive
months designated by the Supervisors of
the various counties between October 1
and March 1 and that if the . Supervisors
express no preference the open season
shall be from November 1 to February L
Doves and wild pigeons may be killed
during any three consecutive months
chosen by the Supervisors from June 1 to
Januarv 1. or from AiiRust 1 to January
1 if the' Supervisors fall to designate.
1'artridee. grouse, mountain quail and
sago hens may be killed from September
1 to November 1 and gray or tree squirrels
during the same period.
Male deer are to be legitimate prey for
hunters only during two consecutive
months from July 1 to December 1 if the
matter Is regulated by the Supervisors and
if not from July 15 to September 15.
The killing of pheasants, Chinese or
Eastern quail, bobwhltes and female deer
is prohibited altogether, as Is the slaying
of game during evenings, nights and early
mornings and hunting with blinds. It was
provided that no person should kill more
than three deer in a season.
The "possessory" clause provides that
no person shall take or have in his pos
session at one time more than twenty
live quail, wild duck, snipe, curlew or
ibis; forty doves, twenty quail or eight
The birds that might be killed ot will
were enumerated and Included the
meadow lark.
The question was raised at once when
the "possessory clause" was read as to
how dealers and eating-houses were gn-
Ing to operate under it. The suggestion
was made that dealers be allowed to have
more in their possession than hunters.
II. T. Payne said this would be special
legislation and unconstitutional.
"The clause will never be passed by the
legislature- unless the dealers and hotel
men are protected," said C. M. Belshaw
of Antiocn.
John Burns of Sutter County Inter
posed here a plea for the ducks. He said
they were Just as thick in his county as
ever and ate the grain, and that the
farmers would kill them anyway. He
made a plea, too. for the hunters.
On motion of Professor Jordan the pos
sessory clause was referred to the judi
ciary committee with instructions to
amend It fo no hardship v/ould be placed
on dealers and eating-houses, and resub-
One delegate thought the Indians were

BUTLER JOHN P. HILL
being unjustly treated because of the nar-
T' w deer-killing limit.
"It is because of the Indians that the
law should be made strict," said R. T.
Johnson. "Up in Del Norte the Diggers
slaughter the deerjerk the hind quarter*,
sell the hide and throw the rest away."
The secretary read a resolution fath
ered by Merton C. Allen and following the
lines of the Maine law, providing that
every person wishing to kill deer should
pay a fee of 50 cents to the Fish Com
mission and receive three tags, the limit
of the number of deer each person should
kill, one of which was to be attached to
each animal slain.
William West objected to its adoption
on the ground that It would be difficult
for those In the country to get tags. F.
1J. Naylor of San Diego said his people
would have to travel or send 600 mllea
for tags. C. M. Shortrldge Joined in the
opposition.
"This would be clearly a city law." said
W. E. Gerber of San Diego. "The condi
tions are different from those of Maine,
where people from New York, Pennsyl
vania and New Jersey hunt."
The resolution was voted down.
John Staack objected to the protection
of curlew and plover, which he said
were not of value for food and furnished
sport.
"The sportsmen use them though,'*' said
Dr. W. B. Cook of Eureka, "to furnish
a pretext for hunting ducks out of sea
son."
The birds mentioned were left under
protection.
E. C. Tallant of Santa Barbara said
meadow larks should be taken from the
unprotected list.
"The farmers complain that the larks
eat most of their grain," said Dr. J. W,
Hayes of Grass Valley, "and they don't
want them protected.
S. C. St. John objected to enumerating
the unprotected birds. Many that should
be exterminated would thus be by infer
ence on the protected list.
"There Is the destructive butcher bird,
which is not mentioned." he said. "They
should be shot at all times. These birds
eat the contents of thousands of doyes'
eggs and leave the shells hanging on the
fences,"
1 In response to a motion by Belshaw that
the names of all birds not classed as
game be mentioned. Professor Loomls
said there were over three hundred of
them. Mr. Belshaw hastily withdrew his
motion.
It was resolved that game wardens
should be provided for. their compen
sation to be $100 a month in counties of
the second and third class, $75 In the
fourth, fifth and sixth cIhes counties, $60
In the seventh, eighth and tenth class
counties, and $50 In all others.
W. C. Kennedy of Merced was very an
tagonistic to some of the proposed laws,
and said none of them would "stick no
how" in his county.

For the first time In his life, and perhaps
for the last, the distinguished prelate paw
aryl heard with what warmth and gener

good will, the members of his faith greet
thoir leaders. Metropolitan Hall was
crowded to the very last seat In the gal-

aft-les, encroached to the railing 1 of the
stajce. swayed patiently and with eaper
tii'fs a.r.6 anticipation in the lobbiow. They
lined the walls and occupied every avall
a! le (a the bip building, â¢ The hall,
with its thousands of people and Its brtl- I
flant 6tar-spar.g1eJ dec.-.ratlonB of red. Â¦
white and blue, was an inspiring scene
when the music of the crgan heralded
the comin? of the purst of the right and
the two score of prients and laymen who
acted ts his escort.
By common Impulse ever}' one in the
great assemblage arose as the Pupal

i ...... ;The semi-annual meeting of the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Association, a3
represented by its executive committee
and advisory council, at the Palace Hotel
last evening was interesting and progres
sive. Upon the strength of a statement
made by President William Thomas that
while the association had money enough
for present purposes, but had signally
failed to get members and that members
were needed more than money, it was de
cided to make the membership fee only
$1. On that basis, Mr. Thomas said, it
would be possible to get 10,000 members
this year. The constitution of the asso
ciation was amended accordingly and the
membership committee was authorized to
pay competent persons a commission to
secure members. Mr. Thomas reported
the list of subscribers of funds. The total
amount subscribed is $10,300.
J. B. Llppincott, representing the United
States Geological Survey, and Elwood
Mead, representing the Irrigation Inves
tigation of the Department of Agriculture,
reported. ' 'In total there is $24,000 available
to be expended in the field work this year.
Both thought that by the middle of Sep
tember a report could be made concerning
water supplies, water rights, reservoir
sites and other questions concerning the
Irrigation of the dry counties In the State.
Both said that had it not been for tho
Water and Forest Association's work
there would have been a deficiency In
their funds this year and the work in this
State would' have met with delay. To
this Mr. Thomas said that the credit was
due to Congressman Kahn.
Generally speaking the substance of the
report has been anticipated, but Mr. Mead
had some new facts concerning Cache
Creek, on the west side of the Sacramento
Valley, and he urged vigorously that ex
ploitation of that stream should be in
cluded in the programme of field work
this season. He said that he hoped that
the assistance of lawyers might be had to
frame legal recommendations -in Septem
ber.
A general discussion followed in which
all the civil engineers took part. Among
those present were: Chief Justice Beatty,
Professors Soule and Marx, respectively
of the State University and Stanford
University: W. G. Sanborn of Berkeley,
Marsden Manson, C. E. Grunsky, T. C.
Kriedlander, Surveyor General Gleaves,
Will S. Green and Colonel E. A. Denicke.

MARSHAL APPOINTED
FOR BUNKER HILL DAY
The British bark Dominion, on which the
underwriters paid 65 per cent to reinsure
their risks, reached Sydney, N. S. W.,
prior to the 25th inst. The vessel was the
subject of a great deal of speculation on
the water front, and a number of people
have cleared up quite a respectable sum
on the gamble.
The Dominion left Tacoma on March 4
with 907,262 feet of lumber for Sydney, N.
S. "W. The day she passed out through
the straits of San Juan de Fuca it was
blowing a gale, and the bark got the full
force of it. Nothing was thought of this
at the time and no fears were entertained
for the vessel until the steamer Willapa
arrived on the Sound from a cruise along
the Alaskan coast. Her crew reported
that a name board with the letters "Dom 1 
nlon" on it had been picked up at Cla-oost
by the Indians, and that at Eucluelet a
red-painted boat, badly smashed, had
come ashore. There was no name on it,
but it was provisioned with canned goods,
biscuits, a water cask and a demijohn
containing some liquor. The oars were in
the boat.
Excursion to Alaska.
As soon as this news was made public
the reinsurance on the Dominion was
started at 10 per cent. It remained at that
ligure for a Â¦while and then gradually rose
to 25 per cent as no news came from the
lumber vessel. Then the halibut steamer
Edith arrived at 'Seattle with the news
that in Wrangel Narrows a lifeboat
marked Dominion had been picked up.
This caused the underwriters to at once
raise the rate of reinsurance to 50 per
cent, and as the discussion over the ves
sel's chances went on this offer was final
ly advanced to 65 per cent. It was still at
that figure yesterday when the news came
of the arrival of the vessel at her des
tination.
The Dominion is an old vessel and has
had a number of narrow escapes from de
struction. It was this fact that made the
underwriters fear for her safety. She waa
once owned In San Francisco, but was
taken to Sydney a few years ago and sold
there. She was afterward condemned, but
finally got a new license. On her next
voyage, with a cargo of coal from New
castle, N. S. "W., to Honolulu, she sprang
a leak and had to put into Sydney in dls
tress
More Vessels for Nome.
The steamer Newsboy, which arrived
yesterday from Hueneme, will be put on
the berth for the gold fields just as soon
as her southern cargo is discharged. She
has been purchased by Walter S. Scam
mell from Robert Dollar. No expense will
be spared in order to make her a first
class passenger ship. She will take away
about a hundred gold hunters and all the
cargo she can carry. A considerable quan
tity of the freight is for Charles D. Lane.
Some of his men who were left behind
Thursday will follow him to Nome on the
Newsboy. > Â¦ ', â¢-Â¦Â¦â¢.â¢â¢
The steamers Valencia and St. Paul are
to sail for Nome to-day. The Valencia
will leave Howard-street wharf No. 3 at
10 a. m., and the St. Paul will get away
from Fremont-street wharf at 2 p. m. A
large crowd of notables will leave on the
St Paul, while "Lucky" Baldwin and his
dancing girls aro booked by the Valencia.

ing season that should prove very popular

over the lakes and down the Yukon to
Dawson, down the Yukon River to St.
Michael and then back to San Francisco
or Puget Sound by way of Cape Nome,
Cape York and Golofnin Bay. The last
trip will be on the palatial steamer Sen

outing.
News From the San Pedro.
The gold hunters who left here on the
San Pedro are having a hard time of it,
according to a letter sent to The Call by
one of the passengers. The vessel put
into Drakes Bay and from there the let
ter was sent to this city. It is as follows:

BROOKLYN HANDICAP
The Bonheur lodgings In Paris were In
the sixth story of a tenement house.
Here Auguste painted. Isadora modeled,
Rosalie sketched and taught her little sis
ter Juliette. The father, now that his
children were self-supporting.resumed his
painting and supervised the efforts of the
industrious family, happy in their congen
ial work. Flowers and birds beautified
the home of these Attic philosophers and
a docile sheep served as an accommodat
ing model for the entire family. Occa
sionally the strong Jpadore would carry
their four-footed friend down the six
flights to the fields below and after an
hour's grazing would carry him up again
to the roof garden. This little incident
but serves to show the happy family
spirit for which the - Bonheurs were al
ways noted. It was always a grief to
Rosalie that her brother Auguste. whom
she thought unappreciated by the art
world, should not nave received the Le
gion of Honor until two years after her
self.
At 19 her pictures were first exhibited.
Two years later, 1847. the twelve can
vases which she submitted were flanked
on either side by pictures from the brush
of Auguste Bonheur and 'his father â the
first they had ever exhibited. Henceforth
several Bonheurs were represented in
every salon catalogue, their work prov
ing the excellence of the early training
given them by their father. -
After Rosalie received the gold medal
for her "Cantal Oxen" In 1S49, her fatner
was made director of the Government art
school for girls. He did not live long to
enjoy this honor, and was succeeded by
Rosa.' who took her sister Juliette as as
sistant. The new director, quick to dis
cover talent, praised - or reproved with
equal abruptness, sent the ungif ted fly-
Ing back to more prosaic occupations, se
verely discountenanced the unnecessary
wearing of masculine attire adopted by
her enthusiastic votaries and expected
others to work as untiringly as herself.
The necessity of frequenting the great
slaughter-houses of Paris In order to
study untrammeled the, animals Immor
talized on her canvas led Rosa. Bonheur
to adopt that boyish attire which she
wore In. a modified form during the re
mainder of her life. With her hair cut
short and attired In the convenient
blouse, this younar woman used to seat
herself upon a load of hay, spread out
her paints and work away as oblivious to
the respectful admiration of drovers and
butchers as In her girlhood days she had
ing instruction in drawtng and painting.
Rosalie's aversion to school life now be
came as exasperating as it was amusing.
Truant trips to the woods and fields
alternated with keen caricatures of the
teachers, mounted on the schoolroom
walls with a putty made of chewed bread.
These spirited sketches her Instructors,
with mingled chagrin and enjoyment, af
terward gathered into a scrapbook.
Falling.so signally as a student, she was
next apprenticed at a sewing school,
where her lack of achievement confessed
pronounced deficiency. She pined so for
fresh air that she finally became III. and
in despair. M- Uonheur let the unhappy
child come ln;me. While the puzzled
father was trying to decide what to do
with Rosalie she developed such an apt
ness In handling his art materials that he
was startled into a perception of her
great possibilities. lie therefore took
great pams to teach her the rudiments ot
drawing and correct perspective, and then
sent her to the Louvre to 'copy the old
masters. Here she worked with /such
happy assiduity and complete oblivious
ness to aught but the work in hand that
the merit of her copies brought ready
purchasers.
At 17 she tramped the country over, often
hungry, drenched to the skin, but buoyed
up by the beauty of landscape or model
and her increasing ability to worthily rep
resent them. At this time she had a pref
erence for landscape painting, but s a suc
cessful picture of a goat led her to make
animal paintings her specialty. In her
youth she also evinced a decided tendency
for expressing her artistic impulse In relief
as well as in color, for some time these
twin gifts of sculpture and painting
struggled for the mastery, but color ex
pression finally won the day.

MET ROUND THE
FESTAL BOARD
BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER, presi
dent of the University of Califor
nia, fittingly closed the session of
the Teachers' Institute yesterday
with a common sense talk to the members
of the department. He was the last
speaker to address the assemblage and
his speech proved to be the piece de re
sistance of the entire session. The bril
liant scholar gave the teachers a "heart
f Â¦ 1HE sessions of the San
| Francisco Public School
Teachers' Institute that
have just terminated have
promoted a broader knowledge
of ths science of education
and, to some extent, a better
understanding of methods em
ployed. It is only as questions
are stated from different
points of view and as larg-e
masses of experience are ac
cumulated that hope of avoid
ing mistakes and of making
educational practice conform
to the dictates of. common
sense can be realized. Many "
citizens are unaware of the
great strides that have been
made in perfecting a rational
theory in education and in
adapting that theory to the
young. Convocations of teach
ers such as that which has
just taken place emphasize the
fact that richly endowed
minds, disciplined by long
study and experience, are con
stantly bestowing their best
thought and energy in per
fecting the system of public
education. This is giving a
vast impetus to every plan
which is designed to exalt the
people in their moralj intel
1 ectual^and^^aterial-lifeP Â» ' * *
Our teachers are to be con-"
gratulated upon the fact that
educational themes were at
tractively and effectively dis
cussed, and their appreciation
was manifested in their
marked attention and respon
sive interest.
The institute was a success
and those who contributed to
instruction and entertainment
have won the grateful senti
ments of , the teachers.
B. H. WEBSTER,
Superintendent of Schools.
The speaker said he was opposed to lec
turing. He thought it was not only use
less but a loss of time. He said a teacher
ought to be 'right among his pupils and
by sympathy and encouragement show
them that he is interested in their prog
ress. He said the university of the future
would be changed into seminaries and la
boratories. It was his opinion that what
was paid to a class in a lecture could just
as easily be read in books. He also said
teachers must have composure and pa
tience In the schoolrooms; that they must
have faith in God and feel that he is reg
ulating things. He advised his auditors
not to go on with teaching if their diges
tion was not good. It is not safe, he said,
"Don't be afraid to teach good habits.
The habit of attention is of prime import
ance in the schoolroom. It is the teacher's
mission to stimulate attention. When I
was teaching night school in North Prov
idence I went there the first night with
the idea that I would convey information
to hungry souls. I accumulated a number
of things to tell my pupils, but I had not
been there a half hour when I discovered
that the chief function of the teacher was
to throw pupils down the stairs until such
time as the remainder thereof were at
tentive and obedient."
"I don't believe In giving a child the
reason for things. We want obedience;
we want children to do what they are
told to do. If thev don't do it, well, find
a way to make them do it. The first
thing a child needs to know is that it is a
member of society and that it must con
form to the dictates of society; that so
ciety has substance to if, that It is built
on granite. We have too many law
breakers among us who are made so by
feeble mothers and teachers, who are
made so by people who tell them things
and argue with them. Obedience is a
habit acquired by obeying: disobedience
is acquired by disobeying. It is the home
that Is to blame most of the time. I
would advise you, of course, not to tell
the scholars to do too many things. I
would not Issue any orders that from the
nature:: of.: things could not bo;. fulfilled.;
Every 'case of disobedience' dates Â¦from"R
lack of ' habit. Criminals .are a kind of
an anarchist, agnostic or people who de
test to go the way of the world; they are
people who do not think about traveling
on tracks. Â¦ They do not like any of these
conformities with the usages of society.
When introduced to the large audience
the State University's president was un
able to proceed with his address for sev
eral seconds because of the hearty greet
ing lie received. The teachers had listened
to his brilliant lecture on "Greece, the
Home of Greek Hlhtory," the night be
fore, and his brilliant efforts were still
fresh in their minds. When the applause
had finally subsided President Wheeler
facetiously remarked that one of the
chief qualifications of a teacher was to
go home from a teachers' Institute and
remain oneself. He said he had a number
of nostrums to deal out, but adjured his
auditors not to take any of them home
for their own consumption. He advised
the teachers not to believe what a peda
pog-ue told them until they had tried it.
He said there was no doubt that teaching
was an art that had to be acquired as Is
painting, telegraphy or stone carving. He
touched on the necessity of having willing
pupils and said the first thing that was
absolutely necessary -was to have a child
mind.
to heart" talk, which evidently struck a
responsive chord in the hearts of his
auditors, judging by the amount of ap
plause which greeted each well turned
Fentence. Professor Wheeler's address
was full of sound advice. His subject.
"The Qualifications of the Teacher," gave
him every opportunity to expatiate on the
vital needs of the educator of the rising
generation. â¢ ' .
Incidents of the Final Session as Seen by Warren.
Resolved, That the teachers assembled in in
stitute hereby emphatically condemn the prac
ticn of handing a warrant to a friend Etand
injr in line to have it cashed ahead of Its proper
order. We recognize no essential difference
between euch act and the act of stepping into
the" line at that point, and we regard it as a
grcsi- imposition on those already In line, and
an indication of low ethical development.
Mrs. M. L. O'N'eal. principal of the La
puna Honda School, discussed "Local
History in the San Francisco Public
Schools." The paper was excellent, but
the lady's voice was not strong enough
to be heard by the whole assemblage.
Mrs. Susie Hert-Mark sang a number of
song8 which were ,?reatly enjoyed. The
institute adjourned to meet again in De
cember in conjunction with the California
State Teachers' Association.
Whereas, At the bond election held in thla
city in November, it was voted to issue bonds
for the erection of. needed new school bulld-
Ir.g?, and,
Whereas, the legality of the bond Issue has
been called into question and the matter Is
new In ,the hands of the Supreme Court t>t'the
State,; awaiting its decision; and; ' V '
Whereas.' It is ror the best educational in
terentR of the city that these new school build
ings be erected at the earliest possible date
therefore, be it
Resolved. That we. the teachers of San
Francisco. In convention assembled respect
fully request and urge the Supreme Court to
give this matter immediate attention and ren
der an early decision; and, be it
Resolved. That the City Superintendent of
Public Instruction be requested to forward a
ccpy of these resolutions to the State Supreme
Court, and also another copy to the Federation
of Improvement Clubs, with a request that
it Indorse and forward the same, with Its In
dorsement, to the State Supreme Court.
The following resolution was also
adopted:
to educate human souls unless they had
digested their meals. Souls and stomachs
do not have a relation.
In concluding he told the teachers they,
could not lift their pupils toward heaven
by dimming God's light. He appealed to
them to take hold of the good in them
and lift them up by both hands. He asked
th a m to be optimistic, eat healthful break
fasts and digest them 'and then go to
school with faith in God and the deter
mination to do their duty.
The morning session opened with a .song
by the pupils of the sixth and seventh
grades of the Everett Grammar. School
under the direction of Miss Cora Galla
gher. This was followed by a. paper, by
George M. Stratton, associate professor
of psychology, acting head of the depart
ment of the University of California, on
"Imitation and Growth of the Individ
ual." Professor Stratton spoke at length
on the subject of imitation and its influ
ence upon the pupils. He gave the teach
ers sound advice as to how they should
make use of the power which they pos
ses^ to set a pattern for those whom they
were engaged in teaching.
.Robert Lloyd followed and sang popular
selections. "The Use of Music in the Pub
lic Schools" was discussed by Frederick
Hurk, principal of the State Normal
School. After naively admitting that he
never sang a note in his life the speaker
said music was not a luxury, because If
it was it would be wiped out of the
schools. "Music." he said, "should be
; used for the inculcation of patriotism, re
ligion and love in the hearts of the chil
dren. .The way to do this la to teach
the pupils a great number of melodies.
Only one pupil out of twenty should be
trained to be a musician for music's sake
; Let them hear lots of musicâ plenty of it
â and fifteen or twenty times a day."
When the applause had subsided a recess
was taken for live minutes. Upon recon
vening Chairman Webster read the fol
lowing resolution, which after some de
bate was adopted:
The year after Rosa Bonheur received
the gold medal her "Plowing In Nlver
nals" and "Haymaking in Auvergne"mado
a furor which reached its climax in 1*53.
when the artist, then in her thirty-first
year, completed the celebrated "HorsÂ©
Fair." This picture was painted on tho
largest canvas ever undertaken by any
animal painter. It took eighteen months
to paint and necessitated biweekly visits
to the horse markets. A pet horse put
his foot through the canvas and thus de
layed for some months the completion of
the picture. The English love of horses
caused Englishmen to greet this picture
with an enthusiasm which soon spread
to America. A. T. Stewart then bought
the "Horse Fair" of its English purchaser
and it now hangs In the Metropolitan Mu
seum in New York. When Landseer. whi>
admired the artist even more than her
canvases, first saw the "Horse Fair" ha
said: "It surpasses me, though it's a little
hard to be beaten by a woman." After
viewing this picture the Paris Salon ex
empted thenceforth all the work of Rosa
Bonheur from examination by the Jury of
admission. Napoleon III shared the pop
ular enthusiasm over the "Horse Fair."
but hesitated to violate the conventionali
ties by conferring tho medal of the Lesion
of Honor for the first time upon a woman.
So Eugenie, careless of Imperiling her
popularity and determined that honors
should be bestowed where most deserved,
drove informally to the fine old
place near Fontainebleau ar.d pinned the
medal upon her working blouse.
Utterly unaffected by the highest honors
which could be. showered upon her Rosa
Bonheur worked as Industriously as ever
In the seclusion of her forest home. She
said that while she believed that her fa

masters of painting had he not been,

Louvre. The oddity of her practical at
tire never brought any indignity upon
her. though many and comical were the
predicaments into which It brought her.
All of these she took in good part, put
ting her shoulder to the wheel when por
ters, mistaking her for one of their class,
asked her assistance, and passing off
with &. Joke their slighting remarks about
her weak muscles.

Is a summary of the events:
NEW" YORK, May 25.â The intercolle
piate ' amateur athletic championship
games were begun to-day on" Columbia
Field before a meager crowd of specta.
tors and under weather conditions which
were anything but promising for a good
afternoon's sport. The cinder track was
soggy and fully two-fifths of a second
slow, and the infield was practically a
quagmire. Pennsylvania gathered in
enough' positions this afternoon to war
rant a prediction of victory for the red
and blue striped athletes to-morrow.
Their supremacy can be attributed to the
prowess of A. C. Kraenzlein, who quali
fied in four events to-day and has a big
possibility ot scoring first honors in the
tlnals of three out of five of these events.
Two intercollegiate records were bro
ken in the trials, and it is possible that
with good weather and a dry track othei
records may be broken to-morrow. The
records that were broken" to-day were

to overstaying the bull side of this staple, has

NEW TORK. May 25.â The stock market

the almost stagnant condition of the market
Later ln the day the curtaining Influence was
less effective and prices generally declined be

rumors wej-e <1! *oem1r.ated that other houses

veloped IWore the clcse to warrant Ui*5e
rurr.ors. The undertone of the market was
rather depressed in spite of the support. The
extent of the failure affected sentiment ad
versely and the collapse in cotton was looked
to as materially altering the prospects of the
cotton section owing to the dÂ»creased price
of the article. It was pointed out that the
invariable result cf tnith efforts to establlj-h
abnormally high prices ls a relapse to ab
normally low prices. The disposition mani
fested in Liverpool to extend the bear move
ment ln cotton instead of turning the buying
tide at the decline disappointed some ex
pectation. The prospm of a large Increase

than relieve depresrlcn. In rplte of the racier
money rates abroad there was no disposition

XEW YORK. May 23.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Speculation continues to be very
restrictive ln character, public Interest in the
market being small, while transactions are
principally the result of professional traders'
activity. This has, however, beeo an Interest-
Ing though disappointing week for Wall street
and Involved one serious disaster ln Stock Ex
change circles. It began with more or le"'s
renewal of bullish feeling on the part of the
speculative community, caused by the an
nouncement that the New York gas war had
been brought to an end. also by the news that
Secretary Gage has called the $25,500,000 of ex
tended 2 per cent Government bonds for re
demption, thereby tending to prevent any un
due accumulations in the treasury. Last'Sat
urday the advances were general and on Mon
day the market opened with a further display
of strength, which, however, did not continue
as there seemed to be a decided disposition to
take profits. Prices accordingly receded ir
regularly, though bullish manifestations were
kept up more or less ln special stocks like
Sugar. Tobacco. Atchlson preferred or Vorth
em Pacific, and the market, while dull, was
not a weak one. London operations ln our
market were mixed and at one time exag
gerated reports about the presence of the
bubonic plague at San Francisco created a
disposition to liquidation of American stocks
in the foreign markets. Some attention was
paid fo the crop situation, and although re
port* of drought In the Northwest were heard
the general situation was favorable to the
granger railroad prospects. The decline of for

STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
Beyond a slight Improvement in Giant Pow
der at IS4 S74'<| S5 23 there was nothing new
on the morning session of, the Bond Exchange.
Business was quiet.
In the afternoon there were sales of Oceanic
Steamship at 193 and Giant Powder at !S5@St>.
Dullness continued to prevail.
THE STOCK MARKET.
Save for a little spurt of activity early corn

CHICAGO, May 25.â The cool, sequestered
valo of life which the wheat market placidly
trudged along to-day was only He in width.
If the expression may be used. The Northwest
was - still - without rain, of the sort neede-3,
though Winnipeg, Grand Forks and Fargo got
a little moisture which was sufficient to de
press prices here a bit. Before the news of
these â¢ showers reached, here the market was
firm on . the Liverpool , steadiness, the . dryness
hereinbefore referred to and the damage claims
from â¢ Kansas and Illinois. The majority Â¦ of
traders are inclined to wait something definite,
although it is generally believed here that rain
in the Northwest would at least be of some
benefit. . Trade was light both for caah and
ln ;the speculative article. July wound up
steady. %c lower at 67f67Vfec. ,
NEW YORK, May 25.'â Advices from abroad
were rather unsatisfactory and [in sympathy
with this factor, together with the continued
larce recelDts of tin. caused a drop of some

Failures for the week have been 1S5 In the
United States, against 142 last year, and 20
ln Canada, against IS last year.
The movement of breadstuffs has now ma
terially chanced, Atlantic exports of wheat
flour included, having been ln four weeks
10,405.397 bushels, against 8.G57.165 last year.
Pacific exports 2.791,791, against 1.932.703 lost
year, and exports of corn i3.917.631. against 10 -
ii)i,662 last year. Prices have changed very
little, the excitement being concentrated upon
cotton, which declined 7-16c.
The nominal price of Bessemer pig ls held
without change at Pittsburg and without trans
actions. Bessemer ls offered much below the
?24 90 asked by the association, while prices
of finished products of iron and steel have de
clined more than IS per cent within two months
without any reduction ln rails, structural
shapes or ln sheets. No. 1 Lehlgh pig Is
quoted here at $21 and the best anthracite $22
at Philadelphia. But doubt about sufficient
supplies of steel-making Iron for the coming
months seems the one impediment to renewal
of activity. Tin is also a shade lower, with
copper and lead unchanged this week. Sales
of Connellsvllle coke below prices recently
quoted exhibit in strong light the change in
the iron manufacture. â
Sudden and extensive changes are now re
ported ln leather and boots and shoes, ap
parently resulting from the unyielding refusal
of many dealers to place anything like their
usual orders for the season at prices recently
asked. Concessions are now reported at 2Hc
to Sc per pair ln leading grades for which
such reduction was not reported a week ago.
?o that the general decline averages above
3 per cent. It was doubtless based ln part
upon considerable concessions in leather, as It
now appears that subsequently all staple
grades have been sold at prices >4c to lV4c
below those recently quoted, the fall averag
ing about SVi per cent. â¢"
Weakness in wool, as yet not enough to
prompt heavy buying, has hindered free pur
chases of goods, without doubt, and there ls
of late somewhat more compliant of cancella
tions and of slow collections. Rut the market
is waiting rather than unhealthy, and with
quick adjustment to a lower range of prices
for material might soon become as active as
at any other time for years. The silk manu
facturer Is helped bv reduction in prices of
raw and the decline ln Manila hemp also aids
a manufacture which is beginning to accom
plish more than many realize.
NEW YORK. May 25.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Transition to a more natural range of prices
after a time of extraordinary buying, specu
lation and rise ls not wholly delightsome, how
ever needful it may be to business health.
But the gradual change this year, though
wearying, has given opportunity ln various
branches to avoid loss. It ls nearly six months
since the highest prices of pig Iron were
reached, November 29, and of wool, December
1, while hides reached their maximum Decem
ber 13, leather and iron products January 10,
boots and shoes January 24, wools February
21 and cotton goods March 21. The tables given
by this paper have shown that the highest
point for all prices was March 16, and after
two months of slow decline the range for all
prices was but 4.6 per cent lower May 14. But
the past week has added Its full share, a fall
Â°f *hi per cent In cotton, 3 per cent in pig
Iron, 1.5 per cent ln iron products, 2 per cent
ln hides, 2% per cent ln boots and shoes and
3V4 per cent ln leather. 2\k per cent in petro
leum'and a little in many other products.
The decline ln cotton was rendered sensa
tional by the failure of the firm which had
most, strongly resisted it and for some months
had led: the campaign for higher prices ln the
belief that stocks fcr the rest of this year
would scarcely meet demands with the next
crop ln doubt. The course of the market for
some months to come cannot well be predicted,
as provision for the future has been made by
spinners on both sides of the ocean.

Prunes Advancing.
The New York Commercial of the l?th say?:
"The markrt was stirred up early yesterday
inominj when it became known that one of
the largest prune sales ever transacted in New
York had occurred. Santa Clara 40-iOs, 25-lb
boxes, were immediately advanced to â¢iHc. and
the wh-.le market became quite firm. Evap
orated apples are weakening, prime declining
*mc Some sales of future apricots for de
liver}' in July attracted attention. There ls
some doubt as to whether the sellers will be
able to deliver them. The general feeling in
arrf'-otF. though, ls toward a decline."
Under date of the l?th the same papÂ«-r Bavr:
"â¢Prunes still hold chief interest ln the dried
fruit trade. The big block of seventy Â«-ir-
Icads taken the other day by a local syndicate
has Influenced the market greatly. The feeling
ls very firm and further advances from the
present outlook are to be expected before the
new (roode come in. Many export orders have
been received, which, taken tosrether with the
shortage in the berry crop, denote a good
trade during the eummer."

was Liverpool buying ln the morning, but the
close was dull, in sympathy with New York.
Copper shares were heavy on the fall in metals.
The bank bought Â£10.000 gold in Australian
bars and received Â£5000 from Malta. The Bank
of France reduced its discount rate from 3',4
to a per cent. The Berlin bank is expected to
follow suit.

hardening, as will be seen In the first column,
but the local situation is dull., At the same

to not over 200 cars at most, and these will
probably be clean?d up before the new crop
appears. One or two more sales like that re

Two Venturesome Youths Captured
While IVaiding the Hare Corral
at Ingleside.
Albion Erlckson and James Gorman, two
industrious youths, aged respectively 11
and 14 years, took it Into their heads to
have rabbit stew for their meals for the
next week. This very laudable ambition
might have been realized but for unex
pected interference with their carefully
laid plans. The youthful strategists had
succeeded in gaining an entrance into the
THEIR DREAMS OF RABBIT
PIE RUDELY DISPELLED
corral of the Ingleslde Coursing Park,
where the hares are kept until turned out
for the dogs to kill on racing days. The
boys barricaded the escapes and with long
poles succeeded in killing eight, hares,
when they were detected by the watch
man. Police Officers C. M. Shore and W.
King of Captain Glllln's troopers were
summoned and soon effected the capture
of the raiders. They were lodged behind
the prison bars on charges of petty, lar
ceny.
De Keercheiter without any further
pnrley struck Byrne on the face, knock
ing him down. He jumped on him. and
planting his knees on his chest continued
to strike him on the face and body. De
Keercheiter is a tall mnn, with long gray
whiskers, and Byrne managed to get hold
of them with his left hand and twisted
them till he yelled with' the pain. "".*
"When I asked him for the rent," said
Byrne, "he wanted two rooms repapered
and painted. I told him that the land
lady was sick and it would be better for
him to wait for another month and she
could look at the rooms. He said he
would not pay the rent unless the room?
were attended to, nnd I said he knew
what he could do if he was not satisfied.
He could quit."
mICHAEL BYRNE, a collector of
rents, told Judge Cabaniss yes
terday that when he next called
upon John de Keorchelter, 2
Himmelmrnn place, ha would arm hirr-
Folf for the fray, lie had occasion to call
upon De Keercheiter Tuesday night for
his month's rent. De Keercheiter is a
scissors grinder and perambulates tho
f-trrets with hi.s apparatus, while his wife,
a little woman, plays a hand organ at
Sutter and Kearny streets to get nickel3
from tho sympathetic, as she says she iÂ»
the mother of three children, who depend
upon her for support. Byrne says that
at no time that he called at the house
did he ever see any children.
Byrne was so badly shaken up by th*
fiffht that hÂ«Â» was unr\ble to leave his
houre till yesterday morninjr. The JudgÂ«>
instructed the warrant clerk to issue a
warrant for De K?*rchriter's arrest on
the charge of assault with intent to com
mit mayhem. The penalty 1r from one to
fourteen years* Imprisonment. '
"Let go my whiskers." he shouted, but
Byrne held on. De Keercheiter grabbed
hold of Byrne's right hand and inserted
his teoth into the fleshy part. Byrn*
pcroamed with pain, and in his despera
tion wrenched the whiskers so hard that
a handful camp out. De Keorcheiter got
Byrne's forefinger and middle finger into
his mouth and bit clear through to the
bonp. This ended the fight, and Byrne
hurried to a physician and had his wound
ed hand dressed.

The License Committee certainly cannot bar
den the taxpayer and real estat? owner with
such taxes as would naturally retard him
from owning property. There ar* but few
pieces In the city that are paylnr sufficient In
come on Investment after dejuctlnsr the taxes
and Insurance, and to burden the owner -with
these additional taxes or licenses, we would
consider unjust and unreasonable. Light
well? are benefl'-lal to the health. simDlv he
cause they ventilate the basements of bulld
lnes which as a rule are dark and unhealthy.
I think !f you will look Into this matter before
having this license ordinance passed yrvu win
find you will be doing the property owner a
sreat Injustice and a detriment to the real
estate Interests of this city. I trust that you
will modify this. *o that. If the city is com*
pelled to get a revenue, a tax of & few dollars
a year on the light wells you will find will bÂ»
sufficient and right and not $2 a foot.
The recommendation of the License
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
for a schedule of licenses on sidewalk ele
vators, projections on sidewalks and light
wells Is the topic of lively discussion
among the owners of business property.
H. P. Sonntag has written to Supervisor
McCarthy claiming that a license of $2 per
foot on light wells or gratlnsrs on the side
walks wocld Impose a tax in many in
stances that would exceed the assessed
tax on the property. He Instances one
building upon which the license charge
for gratlrg would be from JfiO to $w> per
year. The gratings, he says, are mostly
on old buddings thaf were erected thirty
to forty years ago. Part of the communi
cation, which is of general interest. Is a3
follows:
The Calvarv Presbyterian Church eon
gTrgatlon will at once erect probably the
finest church structure on the Pacific

ago on the northwest corner of Fillmore
and Jackson streets. The lot la covered
by two-story buildings, some of them in

DESERTEa WIFE
THROWS VITRIOL
OVER HER RIVAL
Mrs. Charles Iverson Sav
agely Assaults Miss
Lizzie Burgess.
Tracks Her From Mendocino County
to This City and Claims She
Eloped With Her
Husband.
Mrs. Charles Iverson threw the con
tents of a vial of vitriol over the face and
head of Lizzie Burgess last Thursday
n'ght in a lodging house at 1033 Mission
street. The latter was badly burned.
Mrs. Iverson. continued her attack upon
Miss Burgess by administering several
severe blows with a small whip which
she carried concealed about her person.
According to the story told by Mrs.
Iverson she was recently deserted by he*
husband, who eloped to this city from
Ukiah with the woman upon whom the
wronged wife made a violent attack as a
partial satisfaction for the wrongs she
had suffered. The Iversons were married
in 1897 and lived happily together until a
few months, ago. About that time Lizzie
Burgess, who is said to have been a cho
rus girl in one of. the local theaters,
went to Ukiah and was taken Into the
Iverson household. The strange woman
repaid the kindness of Mrs. Iverson by
eloping with her/ husband/ who had suc
cumbed to her wiles. Besides his wife,
Iverson deserted a two-year-old baby.
Last April Iverson and the Burgess wo
man engaged housekeeping rooms at 10K
Mission street. He gave the name of
Burgess and introduced his paramour as
his young wife. Mrs. iverson suspected
the couple, tracked them from Mendocino
County to this city and finally to their
place of abode. About 6 o'clock Thurs
day evening she went to the Mi3sion
street house and inquired of the landlady
for Mr. and Mrs. Iverson. She was told
that no such persons lived In the nous*.
She then gave a description of her hus
band and his companion and the land
lady said: â¢ i*:='.
"Why, you mean Mr. .and Mrs. Bur
gess."
Mrs. Iverson then remarked that the
woman had been married before, and she
was then directed to the back part of
the house where the guilty couple had
two rooms, one of which was used as
the kitchen. The landlady went about
her duties and presently low and excited
talking was heard in the little kitchen.
"You will take my husband from me."
shrieked the infuriated wife. "Take that,
then, you little hussy," and with that
she emptied the vial of vitriol over Miss
Burgess. The liquid ran over the lat
ter's head and down her face, and she ran
shrieking through the hall. Near the
front door she was overtaken by Mrs.
Iverson and was thrown to the floor.
Mrs. Iverson then began plying the whip
over the face and shoulders of Miss Bur
gess, who lay writhing under the lash.
At this juncture the landlady and her
daughter rushed Â».o the rescue and suc
ceeded in wresting the whip from Mrs.
Iverson's hands, savin? the prostrate
woman from further bodily harm.
As soon as Miss Burgess was set free she
ran into the front parlor and locked the
door to prevent further harm at the hands
of the angry wife. The latter then sta
tioned herself behind the front door of the
house and told the landlady that she
w^ould wait for her husband and give him
his Just deserts. The landlady, fearing
that she had a pistol, tried to quiet her.
and at last prevailed upon her to leave
the house on the plea that her husband
would not return for some time.- and that
when he did he might harm her and there
would be no one to interfere.
After Mrs. Iverson went away the in
jured woman was taken to the drugstore
at Sixth and Mission streets, where Dr.
Nusbaum, who was summoned from his
residence, treated her for several burns
on th/> face. The most severe Injury was
done to her left ear. from which a large
piece of flesh was burned off. The vitriol,
however, did not reach her eyes, but spat
tered all about her face. Her waist was
also burned In several places, but no other
injury resulted from the flery fluid.
After her wounds were dressed she went
back to her rooms. *li*^ *he was joined
by her paramour, and the pair packed up
their belongings and left for unknown
parts. The landlady thinks they went to
Oakland, as th*y had oftÂ«Â»n expressed
their intention of doing so. All she knows
about Iverson Is that he was employed
in a wholesale house downtown. The
woman studiously avoided everybody in
the house, but conducted herself prop
erly. Inquiry at the local theaters failed
to elicit any information regarding Miss
Burgess,' who Is said tÂ«* be a chorus girl.
Mrs. Iverson has also disappeared, and up
to a late hour last night Detective Cody,
who has been put on the case, had not
succeeded in disclosing the whereabouts
of the actors in the drama of domestic
difficulties. '

Must Pay Accident Policy.
Justice. of the Peace .Groezlnger gave
Judgment yesterday for $275 in favor of
Joseph Leudan. who sued the Fidelity and
Casualty Company of New York for that
amount. Leudan claimed that he was
accidentally asphyxiated about a year
ago in the Lick House and was incapaci
tated from work for eleven weeks. He
had an accident policy, calling for the
Â¦payment of $25 per week in. the defendant
company, which Â¦ refused to comply with
its terms. Leudan proved that the as
phyxiation was involuntary on. his part,

PHELAN'S MUNICIPAL: v
FLAG A TAX EMBiiEM
PERTINENT communication was ; sent .yesterday , to the , Board . of
/M\ Supervisors by. Otto turn Suden, an attorney ot this" city,. In .which the
It â^new municipal flag adopted by Mayor: Phelan, comes j in for much sa
- tlrical reference. He'suggests that all flagpoles be taxed with-the ex
ception of those flying the Phelan phenlx flag. The communication says: i
"Permit me by. way of suggestion .to supply an omission In your, proposed
order taxing encroachments on sidewalks by means of a license tax. "While
you have taxed nearly, everything Imaginable, ..you -have overlooked -the
flagstaffs. Flagstaffs obstruct the air. -the dust and ,the wind, : and where
they project upon sidewalks are properly subject to a ; license tax.
"I would suggest that only those flagstaffs which fly the flag of. the United
States be taxed, and those which patriotically fly the new "municipal Phelan
flag be exempt. As students, of American history, you; are Caware that the
flag of the United States is the symbol of protest- against the burdens of un
just taxation, whereas the new municipal flag. Is an emblem : of taxes and
more taxes. . ... Â¦ .. .:
t "It is therefore eminently Just that those . back numbers of our citizens
who still dare to fly the flag of the United; States' and, therefore .continue to
emphasize their protest against more taxes should â¢ be taxed. Those' who
humbly and with a proper spirit of deference to the'powers that be hoist high
the Phelan phenlx should be rewarded by not having to pay for this precious
privilege. Very respectfully submitted, â¢ 'V ';^ OTTO TUM SUDEN.

The operation simply amounted to the
Democratic County Committee of San
Francisco, with the exception of three
disqualified members, resolving Itself Into
a county convention to elect delegates to
the coming State gathering at Sacra

in an indirect way.
The committee of five appointed to
formulate a plan to choose delegates to
the local convention made its report at
the meeting of the county body last night.
Chairman McDonald called the gathering
to order at 8:40 o'clock and an adjourn

said Mr. Martin, "employ the best union
labor, pav out $175,000 monthly, use rtfty
tlmes tho' amount of paper and Ink used
bv others, and we think we are entitled
to a little consideration. I submit this
because it has been said that this is a
newspaper fight, and therefore a com
parative statement of the assessments of
opposing Interests is in order. \N e have
no desire to injure the blllpotnerF. I fall
to see, however, where their loss could
be They have a monopoly of the entire
business now. We are governed largely
bv a desire to be fair. We believe that
the beauty of the city demands a reduc
tion in hefght. I have been informed that
only 10 per cent of the business of printing
posters is done in this city. I believe that
there would be large profits in ten-foot
fences and it would be to the interest of
the printers, because the sign painting Is
done on the superstructure, or above the
ten-foot line."
Mr Martin denied the statement that
the cutting down of the fences would re
sult In Increasing the Income of the news
papers. Objections were raised against
the unsightly structures because they are
a detriment* to the city's interests.
Supervisor Connor thought the news
papers had exhibited commendable enter
prise in voluntarily withdrawing all their
bulletin boards when the agitation against
the "freak" advertising had been com
menced. .
Attorney Miller, representing the bill
posters, argued at length for the twenty
foot fence and L. Owens of Owens & Var
ney read protests from a number of firms
against the proposed change.
The committee postponed further con
sideration for one week.

Scotland. f ase and a na "ve of
WHAT threatened to be a serious
fire broke out last night in the
pattern department of the Oc
cidental foundry, at Main and
Harrison streets, owned by Steiger &
Kerr. The blaze was discovered by Pat
Touhey, a watchman, who turned In an
alarm from the auxiliary box stationed in
the foundry. By the time the fire en
gines reached the scone the pattern shop
was enveloped in flames. Fearing a gen
eral conflagration, Chief Sullivan turned
in a second alarm, shortly afterward
followed by a third. By hard work the
firemen succeeded in confining the blaze
to the pattern department, although for
a time it looked as though the entire
blcck was doomed.
Adjoining the foundry on the Harrison-
Street fide are two three-story wooden
buildings, which were partially damaged
by water. One Is occupied, by Joe Kane,
a" member of Engine Company Xo. 9, and
the other by J. Dean, a drayman. Mrs.
Dean was in bed at the time, suffering
from a severe attack of pneumonia, but
with considerable difficulty she donned a
wrapper, and, standing on the porch, or
dered one of her husband's employes to
release a half dozen horses which were in
the barn In the rear of the house. Her
command was promptly obeyed and the
horses led to a place of safety.
When the fire was about under control
fifteen sailors of the French cruiser Pro
tet. under the command of -a lieutenant,
appeared on the scene, anxious to lend
their assistance if necessary. The corn-
mander of the vessel, which is .lying off
Harrison-street wharf, saw the flames
and thinking that a serious conflagration
was in progress ordered all his available
crew to go to the scene. A boat was low
ered quickly and the willing Frenchmen
reached the wharf without delay. Some
were armed with axes and others carried
chemical extinguishers. As they ran up
Harrison street toward the scene of the
blaze they were cheered by the admiring
onlookers. The fire by this time was un
der control and as their services were not
needed they returnr-d to" their ship.
The fire started on the roof of the pat
tern shop, and was presumably caused by
a spark. The putterns which were de
stroyed can be easily replaced. Captain
Comstock estimates the damage at about
$5000, which is fully covered by Insurance.
Scene at the Fire in the Occidental Iron Foundry.
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on Ju
diciary and Streets heard arguments pro
and con yesterday on the proposed or
dinance limiting the height of fences for
advertising: purposes to twenty feet. A
large number of industries interested in
the measure were present. Many reasons
were advanced why the structures should
be limited to ten feet.
C. A. Murdock of the Employing Print
ers' Association argued that the ordin
ance r.ow in force allowing fences to be
twenty feet in height was a fair one. If
thty were reduced to ten feet business
would be cut in halt and the printers
would suffer. He ?ald that there shvuld
be certain restrictions or regulations
where the fenws interfered with any
body's sunlight or fresh air and to protect
the lives of pas?ers-by. The compromise
of fifteen feet was Impossible, as the
paper used was cut for ten feet spaces.
W. J. Mar'in, business manager of the
San Francisco Call, asked Mr. Murdoch
what percentage of the printing was done
by the jobbing printers. Mr. Murdock was
unable to answer, but L. D. Owens, a bill
poster, replied that 85 or 90 per cent was
printed in Saa Francisco, including the
cigar posters. Louis Roesch said he print
ed a large number of cigar posters, but
admitted that many of them came from
the East. Mr. Martin said he would show
how much was invested la the newspaper
business and asked that the billposters
give similar figures. The latter, however,
declined to give out for publicity any
jigures relating: to their investment, but
promised to give them confidentially to
the committee.
Mr. Martin pointedly asked If any gen
tleman present would stand for the state
ment that 83 per cent of the cigar poster
printing was cone in the city. No cne re
sponded.
Mr. Sterett, who Is exclusively In the
poster business and employs seventy or
eighty people, said if the upper ten-foot
fence was taken down it would necessi
tate the painting of signs on the lower
lence and he would sufler losses In con
sequences, as less billposting would be
done.
Thomas Boyle of the Evening Bulletin
contended that the printers would not be
injured by making the fences ten feet
high, but the sign painters, who were not
among the protestants. might suffer. Mr.
.Hoover of the Krancis-Valentine Com
pany argued for twenty-foot fences, and
to a question by Martin replied that his
:irm did not print any posters over ten feet
high.
At Supervisor Comte's suggestion the
committee decided to hear the protestants
against the twenty-foot fences. and
Charles Ulrich, who represented the news
fajtens. addressed the committee. Mr.
'lrich said:
Â¦â¢While newspapers are largely private
interests, you must admit that they are
vitally interested in the city's welfare and
always strive for its advancement. The
twenty-foot fence retards the growth of
the city and makfs it a provincial town.
The fences should be cut down, because
they are in maaiy cases monstrosities.
Only the Silurian allowed his vacant lots
to be surrounded with high fences, be
cause he is not progressive enough to
build on them; but the unsightly struc
tures probably paid the taxes on his un
improved property. Any one coming to
this city and seeing the outrageously high
fences would dub it a-s a third rate town.
"If the statement that the billposters
have $275/Â»n> invested is correct, then it Is
peculiar, because I have learned from
official records that Owens & Varney are
assessed for $1100 and Siebe & Green for
J1175. Now, the newspapers are assessed
for 82.oOO.Wirt. They pay out, mainly in
Falarie.<=. 113,000 monthly to 3'JOO employes,
iicainst the seventy-live men emploved by
the billposters.
"Only a few days ago Mayor Phelan or.
dered the removal of certain unsightly
fifrnF in outside districts on the broad
ground of beauty, and for the same rea
son the towering fences in the heart of
the city should lÂ»e abated as nuisance?.
Now. wo want those fences cut down; tlic
public wants them cut down and there are
emphatic protects against maintaining
them/'
Brandenstein stated that he was satis
fied that from an esthetic point of view
high fences wrre objectionable, but he
w.i* averse to sacrificing the various in
dustrk-F that claim they will be ruined If
the fences are reduced In height.
"Th*re are over ten times the number of
employes directly interested in the cutting
down of the fences that there are who op
pose the plan." said I'lrich.
F. C. Selfridjre of the Central Improve
ment Club j^aid that twenty-foot fences
are a danger and a menace to the lives
of the pa5sers-by. He paid the fact that
the Hoard of Public Works would have
pupervisifin r<f their orectdlon would be of
little avail in oases of high winds: and.
furthermore, the fences became weakened
the longer they were maintained.
I'lrich contended that the danger from
a twonty-font fonce was twice as great
as a t<*n-foot fence and that a death had
once resulted frnm the blowing down of a
fence on McAllister street.
Mr. Martin contended that the city is
not deriving its fair proportion of taxes
from tho lirms who claimed they would
puffer a loss of ESiO.Oiin if the ten-foot limit
was adopted, as Owens & Varney were
asseFsr-d for but $1400. No taxes are paid

MM PROTESTS
'AGAINST HIGH
BOARD FENCES
The constitutionality of the civil service
chapter of the charter was argued before
Judge Cook all day yesterday and there
still remains much to be said.
The case before the court is on the de
murrer of the city to a petition for an In
junction to restrain the Civil Service Com
mission from holding competitive exam
inations. Attorney . P. F. . Dunne repre
sented the petitioners and City Attorney
Franklin K. Lane, George Lane and Gar
ret McEnerney represented the city.
Lane opened the argument. He de
scribed the application for an injunction:
as an attack upon section 12 of Article
XIII of Chapter XIII of the charter. It
is that section which provides that ap
pointees shall not be discharged without
written charges filed with the Civil Ser
vlco Commission and after trial in their
presence. It was claimed by the petition
ers that this was a restriction of the
power of removal which was vested in the
heads of departments by the constitution,
and In that the section was unconstitu
tional.* And further that as section 12 was
a vital portion of the chapter on civil ser
vice tbe whole fabric must fall If the sec
tion be declared invalid. .
Lane touched but lightly upon the ques
tion of constitutionality, confining himself
to this point: that even should the section
be thrown out it is a subsidiary provision
of the charter and so the remainder of the
chapter might stand without it. He cited
several cases which bore upon the point
that when a part of a law, of secondary
importance in itself, has been declared
unconstitutional the remainder of the law
Is not necessarily affected by the throwing
out of the one section.
* In the case at bar, he said, there was
a complete and legal feystem of civil ser
vice provided for evea without the pro
vision of tenure. With that eliminated
there would still be, he . said, sufficient
left to establish the system effectively,
for he contended that the tenure of office
would look out for Itself once the merit
system of appointment had been estab
lished. There would be no use In dis
charging a competent man, he claimed,
if the appointing power could not put in
his place a man he had personal reasons
for appointing; and therefore the tenure
of ofnee provision, while important, was
not of the first importance, and should it
be thrown out should not necessarily ren
der the, whole law Inoperative.
. George Lane followed his brother on the
method of remedy. He claimed that the
proper remedy for suoh an injury as al
leged by the petitioners was not by In
junction but by mandamus.
Dunne took up the argument when court
convened for the lift.' rr.oon. He opened
with the contention that Injunction was
the proper remedy, for proceedings by in
junction were proper In ever}' case where :
a man's property was affected; and in this
case he claimed the petitioner's property
was affected, for he appeared as a tax
payer and lie had a valid claim that his
money was being used bv the Civil Ser
vice Commission for an Illegal purpose.
Continuing on to the question of valid
ity, Dunne argued that as section 12 was
In his opinion Invalid, he considered the
whole chapter invalid on the rule that if
a vital point in an act falls the whole
must fail with it. As to its being a valid
point, he contended that the essence "of
the civil fervlce system is the lnsuranpe
of a life tenure, or one during good be
havior, Â¦ and such a' tenure, he: claimed,
would be in violation of that section of
the constitution which declares four
years to be the extreme limit of service
in office in a subordinate position. It also
restricted the power of removal, he said,
because the theory of tbe constitution is
that the removing power is vested in the
appointing power, and while the charter
expressly stated that the heads of the
departments should appoint, it fur
ther provided that the Civil Service
Commission should remove, or at least
that the system as outlined in the charter
amounted to that.
Arguing further, he called attention to
the provisions in the charter relating to
the" heads- of departments, and how in
each instance it stated <hat "ho ap
point" a certain number of subordinate".
In the civil serv'ce chapter, he continued,
It isset forth that the Civil Service Com
mission may pubmit one or two or three
names from the eligible ;ist from which
the head of the department in which the
vacancy to be fille-1 exists may choose.
Statutes, Mr. Dunno continued, should be
judged not by what may be done under
their provisions but by what can be done,
and In the section clt?d it was under this
idea clearly allowable for the Civil Serv
ice'Commission to submit but one nam<?
for the head of a department to choose
from; a sort of legal gold brick or an of
flcial Hobson's choice." In that case he
claimed the appointing power was clearly
the Civil Service Commission, and the
power was directly at variance with that
conferred upon the heads of the depart
ments by the charter and consequently
by the Legislature. Â¦Â¦
McKnerney wanted to know if that con
tention did not fit with hisâ that the com
mission had the power of removal and so
brought the two together again in the
manner contemplated by the Legislature,
but- Dunne spent no time upon tho ques
tion.
He claimed that the proper way to es
tablish a civil service was to amend the
constitution in such a way as to provide
for it: but he considered the charter. a
legislative enactment that had no power
to run at variance with the constitutional
provisions regarding the four years' ten
ure of office and the relation of the ap
pointing and the removing power.
It was well on toward dinner time when
Dunno concluded, and so the case went
over to 9 o'clock Monday mornlngr. At
that time Mr. McEncrney will argue In
support of the civil service provisions.
