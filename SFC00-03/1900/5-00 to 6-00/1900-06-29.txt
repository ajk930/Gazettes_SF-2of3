GALL. HEADQUARTERS, WELLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, June 28.â Official Washington is hourly expect
ing the receipt of a dispatch from Minister Conger which will determine whether a state of war or riot exists In
China. Though up to the close of office hours this afternoon neither the State nor Xavy Department has received
Information confirmatory of the press dispatches that Vice Admiral Seymour's column and its charges had been
rescued. It is the confident belief of the President and Secretary Hay that such is the case: There remains a ques
tion as to whether the Ministers were expelled from Peking, and. If . so, whether such an: act should be regarded as an
Insult by the civilized world. The recognition of a state of war will involve the possibility of international complications,
end the powers hesitate to take such action, especially when there has been harmony of procedure up to this time. From
present indications Europe and Japan will adopt the attitude pursued by the United States and regard the situation r as a
Elate of international disorder which the imperial Government is .too weak to suppress.
Additional information that the legations were safe was furnished Secretary Hay this afternoon by Wu Ting Fang,
the Chinese Minister, from the Chinese Embassador In London. Minister Wu received a copy of a dispatch from Li Hung
Chang, important only because it shows that Viceroy Li is still at Canton and has not yet started for Peking./ It reads: '
"All foreign Ministers are with Vice Admiral Seymour, twelve miles from Tientsin."
The Minister expressed confidence that no trouble had befallen the legations, and %ald that undoubtedly Viceroy LI
had meant by the term "foreign Ministers" the whole of the legations.
The Minister is conducting himself in a very e'reumspect manner, and there is no disposition ; on the, part of Secre
tary Hay to make his position here morÂ« difficult than it Is. It Is apparent that the Minister's dispatch is several days old,
as Rear Admiral Kempff notified the Navy Department yesterday that the Ministers were with Vice Admiral Seymour's
column eight miles from Tientsin. The Minister FUggested that the imperial Government had furnished the legations with
an armed escort, which whll: on its way from Peking to Tientsin had met Vice Admiral Seymour's command 1 and had
turned their charges over to the allied force. He did not know whether the imperial troops continued with Vice Ad
miral Seymour, aiding the allies in forcing their way back to Tientsin, or had returned to the capital. 'The latter is the
official \lew, .
Before Minister Wu arrived at the State Department Secretary Long received this message .from Rear /Admiral
ICexnpif : Â¦ V ." Â¦-â¢ Â¦'Â¦'Â¦ â¢>
"CHEFU, June 28. â Secretary of Navy, Washington: About 12,000 foreign troops are now ashore. The soldiers or
dered Ehould report at Taku instead of Chefu. I have substituted the Nashville for the Yorktown at Chef tf. The
Yorktovrn Is used aÂ» a dispatch boat, being more suitable."
Considerable comment occurred in official and diplomatic circles to-day In connection with the London dispatch quot
ing Inspector General Hart of the Chinese Customs ' Service as saying that the foreign legations had been* "desired" "to
leave Peking. The dispatch received by Minister Wu from the Tsung-li Yamen and transmitted yesterday to the State
Department announced that, the demand made by the foreign admirals that the Taku forts be turned over to them Im
mediately "looked like an and we communicated the fact to the foreign Ministers in Peking." ;lt was sug
gested In an Eastern diplomatic quarter, to-day that the Chinese Government, fearing tho effect of the action ot the foreign
admirals In so peremptorily demanding the possession of the Taku forts upon a populace already excited by the anti-for
eign movement, had intimated to the foreign legations. ln the interest of their safety that they should remove to Tientsin. 'Â¦Â¦;
"Supposing the foreign admirals had demanded Immediate possession of the Taku forts." said, a diplomat Who discussed
the situation to-day, *;!and supposing the Chinese Government believed this to be a hostile act and tantamount to a dec
laration of war and requested the foreign Ministers in the Interest of their own safety to leave Peking,' who would be re
eponsible? Would the powers have declared war on China? Would China have declared war on 'the powers? China does
not desire war. Every dispatch that Minister Wu has received from his Government or. Its officials proves this [ conclu
sively. She knows the futility of fighting the whole world. Had the foreign Ministers been permitted to: remain'- In. Peking'
It might have been impossible to have restrained the fury of the people when they had learned that the powers had com
menced the dispatch of an army Into the empire, and being ignorant of the purpose of the movement, they might have
thought that it was preliminary to the dismemberment of their country, as has so long been threatened." Â¦
It Js the belief of diplomats here that the allied forces will immediately take up their march to Peking. Nothing offi
cially hao been received here to confirm the report that the Russians withdrew from Vice Admiral ' Seymour's command
when be turned back to Tientsin and continued on the way to Peking. It Is possible this message may have referred to the
Russian column, 4000 strong, which Is reported to have started some days ago for Peking. .Inquiry at the Russian em
bassy to-day developed -that this column has probably been confounded with thaJp which, according to Its Information,
waJB to leave Port Arthur for Taku. , - â¢ /
"Xo matter what or where the Russian troops may be in China," said an attache; who talked about - -the â¢ situation,
"they will be withdrawn when the trouble ende. The Russian Government has announced that they; have been sent 1 into*
China merely for the purpose of protecting life and property, and when their services are no longer required, they will' ba

United States Consuls to Deal "Witli

CALX HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, June 2S.â
In- accordance with the representation
made yesterday by Minister TVu, Secre
tary Hay has sent a cable Instruction
to American Consuls in China, directing
them to confer with Viceroys or their
representative to obtain protection for
Americans and their interests. It is* un
derstood that other powers have given
6imilar Instructions. So long as the local
authorities comply with the represcnta-
tlons by foreign consuls and preserve
peace and order foreign troops will not
be sent Into their territory. This ar
rangement greatly simplifies affairs In an
official point of view, as It confines the
region In Â¦which peace and order must be
restored by the allies to a comparatively
small portion of the great Chinese em
pire.
>^HANGHAI, June 28.â -Admiral Seymour has arrived, at Ticntcin. S*"ty-two of his
men have been killed and 312 wounded. - The damage in Tientsin, it is hoped, has
been exaggerated, but nothing is certainly known. Absolutely no trustworthy infor
mation has come out .of Peking for two weeks? all wires being down. The whereabouts of the
legations is unknown. It is the belief of the Chinese that Prince Tttan has superseded the
Empress Dowager at the head of affairs. Prince Tuan is the recognized head of the Boxers.
Grave tidings come from Shantung province. The Wei-Hsien mission premises have
been destroyed, but the missionaries escaped. This is thought premonitory of fvtrther dis
turbances. Thus far the Boxers have been operating only in Chili ar.d Shantung provinces.
Sixteen thousand troops of the allies Have already landed at Taku. This -number should
be quadrupled. The best interests of China demand the suppression of the Boxers, the
overthrow of the Empress Dowager and the reactionary party, and the reinstatement of the
power of the Emperor. If the Boxers gain any substantial advantage the consequences can
not be foreseen. The insurrection will spread like wildfire.
The Wu-Char\g and Nanking Viceroys give assurances that they are able to quell the
disturbances, and have issued ' proclamations. " Nevertheless the condition of affairs in the
Yang-tse Valley" is "the occasion for serious apprehensions." "Shanghai, under ordinary cir
cumstances, is' safe. "Volunteers and men-of-war are affording protection, but more are
needed both at Shanghai and in the Yang-tsc Valley to meet the contingencies that are more
than possible, and will be beyond the control of the local authorities.*

Hemmed in by Hordes of Fanatical Chinese
the Besieged Column Intrenched and
Successfully Fought Off the Mongol
Assailantsâ One Prisoner Declared That
the Peking Legations Had Been Burned
and the Ministers Killed.
LONDON. June 23, 4a. m.â The casualties of the international force attack
ing Tientsin were: Americans, killed 3. wounded 2; British, killed 2. wound
ed 1; Oenrans. killed 15, wounded 27; Russians, killed 10, wounded 37. The
pin fire of the Americans and British Is described as "beautiful."
After the relieving force passed on to the rescue of Admiral Seymour,
CMaese regulars under General Xieh, says a dispatch from Shanghai, again at
tacked Tientsin fiercely and bombarded the foreign settlement with a terrible
fire.
British Colonel Don-ward commanded the column that relieved Admiral Sey
mour. American marines participated in the achievement. The admiral was found
Intrenched and surrounded by Immense masses of Chinese, who Â¦were driven off
by the relieving column after a brisk fight. His men made a brilliant resistance,
never failing In courage for fifteen da>s of continued fighting. During ten days
the men were on quarter rations. They started with provisions for ten days
and they could have held out a day or two longer.
The column was a few miles beyond Lofa. Deeming it hopeless to attempt
to break through the hordes, Admirnl Seymour essayed a night retreat to
ward Tientsin, but he came into collle-lon with a strong force of Chinese ar
riving' from the northwest, and could neither advance nor retreat. There waÂ»
nothing to do but to Intrench and to stand a siege. He vainly attempted helio
graphlc communication.
Seymour's men caught several . Chinese, who safd the legations had been
burned and the illnisters killed. Others said that the Ministers had been im
prisoned.
The Chinese displayed fanatical courage in the attack.
Four thousand Â¦ Russians left Tientsin four days after Admiral Seymour, but
they never er>t in touch with him.
Railway communication from Taku to Tientsin has been restored and* the force
Is advancing toward Peking. Fighting was in progress Wednesday in the vicin
ity of Ts<? Chulln. Large preparations are being made to support and rein
force the Peking relieving column. Twenty thousand troops of all arms, largely
Japanese, have now been landed. The fate of the members of the legations
Is ctlll a mystery. If they are alive and unharmed at Peking the Chinese Gov
ernment deserves some credit, Shanghai correspondents think, for restraining the
fanatical mob.
The Shanghai correspondent of the Dally Telegraph, wiring at 9:05 p. m. yes
terday, pays:
"It is reported on good Chinese authority that the Government, alarmed by
the foreign military preparations, has issued an edict ordering the peremptory
suppression of the Boxers and announcing a decision to protect the legations at
all hazards."
However this may be, the British Consulate at Shanghai received definite in
formation yesterday, the Daily Express correspondent says, that while solemnly
promising complete abstention from warlike preparations, the Chinese are mount
ing several new 6-inch guns at the Woo Sung forts.
The British warships have sailed from Hongkong to reinforce the allied squad
ron at Shanghai. The southern provinces are sending troops toward Peking, and
the exodus of Chinese of oil classes from Shanghai continues at the rate of from
10.000 to 15.000 a day.
Kusslan prestige has been injured during the recent fighting and an anti-
Russian rising In the Liaotong peninsula, Russian Manchuria, is predicted.
According to the Shanghai correspondent of the Times, advices from Shang

L. L, when he learned that a couple of
newspaper photographers had been loiter
ing about his place and taking surrep
titious views of his children about the
grounds and in bathing.
"You may say, as coming from me,"
said the Governor, "that I will not tol
erate photographers coming here and
taking pictures of my children while they
are bathing. Furthermore, I will take
legal steps. If necessary, to prohibit it and
punish violators of this rule. I wish you
would give all fair warning that I will
not tolerate it. One newspaper sent a
request for me to sit for a picture on
horseback and I consented, and he seemed
satisfied with that. Shortly afterward,
while my children were in bathing In the
cove two photographers, the newspaper
one and another, crept out of the woods
and wfthout permission took snap shots.
That was not a nice thing for them to do,
particularly after I had just done a favor
in sitting myself for one of them."
The Governor said he intended to tak^
the 8:50 train in the morning on his trip
to Oklahoma.

the platform. He spoke at considerable
length. '
"The Republican party," he said, "was
born in giving life to the declaration that
all men were created fre\ and it first
struck the shackles from four million
slaves. Within two years it has brought
the Hghl of freedom to ten millions of peo
ple. You may call it expansion or im

car, and will control and suppress
them. Indorses Senator Nelson for - re
election; favors the election of Senators
by popular vote, and reaffirms the belief

taxation of foreign corporations doing
business in the State.
WORK OF MINNESOTA
Â§S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
Congressman Bulzer of New. York Is
Already at Kansas City Seek
ing the Vice Presidential
Nomination.
KANSAS CITY, June 28.â Convention
signs are apparent, but not very plentiful.
No one In Kansas City talks about any
thing but the coming Democratic Na
tional Convention, and it is evident that
the gathering is to be the event of.tu*
history of the city. Preparations are/bs
ing made* to receive the crowds and the'
citizens Intend to take care of all who
may come, notwithstanding the doubts
that have existed concerning the- ability
of the city to handle a 'great national
gathering. ;; K r^ Â¦;
Among the convention signs are pictures
of .William J. Bryan and the "peerless
young leader of 1536" looks alone from
many windows of the shops and hotels."
Then there are the decorations which ara
beinsr put up on the streets and about
rooms selected for headquarters of differ
ent State delegations, in the hotels the
carpets are being covered with ' canvas
ana drayioad alter drayload of cots and
bedding are being carried in. The cot Is
a sure sign of a convention:
Over at the convention hall every effort
is being made to complete the building by
Wednesday morning, and the men in
charge renew thÂ«ir promises that the con
vention will not be delayed a minute by
reason of incomplete arrangements. . To
rugut there is much more to do, but wher
tvora man can work he is employed, so
that the prediction, of the committee will
no doubt be verified.'
As to political news relating to the con
vention there is more coming into Kan
sas City than is being found or manufac
tured here. The few Democrats who have,
arrived read the interviews .and â¢ reports
of the leaders who are about to start for
the convention or arc on their way here,
and this -forms the basis of most of the
gossip afloat. Of course" the dispatches
lrom Lincoln have the most interest, for
everybody is anxious to know what Bryan
is talking about and what the men- say
who vis* him. There i 3 an > impression
that Bryan may come to Kansas City
daring the convention, and some- of those
now here think that the great demonstra
tion which would follow his appearance
would carry enthusiasm all over the
country and start the campaign off with
a hurrah that would be beneficial.
There is the faintest intimation that
there may he a contest over the platform.
It is known that Bryan not- only wants
the Chicago platform reaffirmed, but that
he also desires to have the 16 to 1 declara
tion reiterated as strongly as it was in
the Nebraska State- platform. There are
other Democrats who think a strong re
affirmation of the . Chicago platform in
a few words and then to pass on to "im
perialism," trusts and other new features
will be sufficient. The latter course is ad
vised as,one tending to satisfy Eastern
Democrats.
The fact that the nomination for first
place is already beyond question naturally
attracts more attention to the second
place, and there is some speculation about
the man who is, to be the Vice Presidential
candidate with Mr. Bryan. As was thÂ»
case in Philadelphia, New York occupies
the center of the stage. Quite a number
of names have been suggested from that
one State, and one candidate, Mr. Sulzer,
already has headrfuarters ppened an'u
some enthusiastic boomers on the ground.
If Sulzer comes here after his visit to
Lincoln, with hopes : high; he will get n
freat many delegates outside his own
tate. 'New York has not Indorsed him.,
but he is said to have.:, the friendship of
Croker. There are those who will remem
ber that hearty support on the part of
the New York organization* will indicate
the desire of Croker.
No one here pretends to explain the talk
about ex-Senator Hill, 'and Western Dem
ocrats say that' his announced Intention
of comingto Kansas City for the purpose
of trying to Mcure a modification of the
platform is sufficient to take him out of
the Vice Presidential race. Hill, it was
understood by men coming direct from
Lincoln, was far * from satisfactory to
Bryan.
Other candidates are mentioned, includ
ing ex-Congressman B. F. Shiveley of In
diana. : and there is some talk about
Charles A. Towne of Minnesota, who was
nominated by the Populists with 'Bryan:
There is no doubt about the earnestness
of Towne and his friends. He has head
quarters engaged and the Silver Repub
licans will hold a convention simultan
eously with the Democratic gathering.
They and the Populists intend to impress
upon the delegates 'the ability of Towne
as a vote-getter and urge his nomination.
Two Leaders Hold Opposing
Views Concerning the
Platform.

LONDON. June 2S.â A dispatch from
Moscow to the Westminster Gazette says
the Boxer troubles and the death of Count
Jiuravicft have greatly accentuated the
difficulties of the financial situation in
Russia, which is in such a critical state
as to arouse the gravest anxiety. The

City and President MclClnlcy will speak.
ernor Dole, which has already been pub
lished, and handed it to the new Secre
tary of the Territory. Then the oath of
office was administered by Chief Justice
Frear. Mr. Dole raised his right hand
and repeated after the Chief Justice the
words of the oath, promising to support
the constitution and laws of the Unite*
States, and of the Territory of Hawaii,
ar.d to conscientiously and impartially'
discharge his duties as Governor of the
Territory. A -wave of applause swept
over the throng as Mr. Dole finished
speaking and stooped to afllx his signa
ture to the oath.
Immediately after signing the oath Gov
ernor E>ole gave his inaugural address. It
was a difficult matter to speak to such a
throng from such a platform. The sun,
which was about as tropical as it ever
is in Honolulu, beat down upon the
speaker and most of the audience, and
now and then a gust of wind sent clouds
of fine dust 0% - er all. The Governor spoke
slowly and clearly, his remarks be'ir.g now
and then interrupted by applause, as he
ppoke of the harmonious union of races
that should come from the opportunities
of the future, and of American citizen
ship.
Before the applause had ceased after
the address. Captain Berger's band struck
up the "Star Spangled Banner," and the
members of the Cabinet rose in their
places with uncovered heads. The band
led the Hawaiian National Guard in re
view past the Governor, the musicians
taking up a place in front, while the men
marched to the drill shed, where the>
were disbanded. The military made a
most creditable showing, and several of
the companies were applauded for their
good marching as they passed in front of
the building.
The military review ended the formal
ceremonies of the day. The Governor and
the man of the hour, and around him
were men who had stood by his side on
both the ether occasions. In front of the
building and around it were the same
crowds, and none who had been in Ha
waii long encuph could fail to be remlnd
td by the ceremonies of to-day, at least
of those of I&3S. The splendid p.olaoe that
has become famous all ever America en
account of its cornoctirm with the history
of Hawaii, and the history of America's
iirst experiment in expansion, was deco
rated as 5n '35. It was ablaze with the
red. white and blue and crowded with
jMHjpie. many of them now newly made
citizens of the Tnited States. The Stars
and Stripes were on all the lanais. in all
the windows, and they made brilliant all
the grand stands, and a huge American
liag Coated on the FtafT above.
On Governor Dolt's right, as he faced
the throng, was a stand In which were
the representatives of foreign Govern
ments. It was bright v.ith color and
crowded with the various Consuls and
their families. On t-he other side there
was another special grand stand. In which
cx-ofSc!a!s cf ihe Government and other
prominent citizens were seated.
Very promptly at 10 o'clock the Gover
nor, with hi:- .Â«'Â¦'.Â¦! Cabinet and staff offi
cers and the Chief Justice entered the
central grand stand, and there was no
iclav In besrinning the ceremonies. Prayer
In- the Rev. Tlmoteo. a native preacher,
was the first on the programme. The
1 *fople stood with uncovered heads while
the minister askf-d a blessing on the new
Territory and its officers, and gave thanks
for the "blessings of the past. It seemed
a fitting commer cement that one of the
Hawaiian race should be flrst to open the
day's programme with prayer.
Minister Mott-Smith read the commis
sion sent by President McKlnley to Gov-
hts Cabinet left the grand stand and en
tered the building, to hold a reception In
the old throne room. The whole crowd
surged forward to follow the Governoi
and staff and grasp the hand of the flrst
American Governor of the Islands and his
executive. Governor Dole, with Colonel
Soper and the members of the executive,
stood in the center of the floor of thÂ«r. j
beautiful throne room, whose walls and:
pictures have looked down upon many a!
similar scene,, while the people entered
at one door, passed by the offlclaJs and
shook their hands. For two hours there
was a constant stream cf people passing i
where the Governor stood, and his arm
v.-as weary with vigorous shakings lons
before the last citizen had spoken the
few words of congratulation that were
repeated over and over again. It seemed i
that all the citizens of Honolulu had ,
come to shake hands with the new offi
cials. Scarcely a prominent citizen was
absent, and the foreign Consuls also
joined the throng. Their offices all cease
to-day as representatives commissioned
to the republic of Hawaii. Consul Gen- ]
eral Yang Wai Pin a.nd Vice Consul Goo
Kirn, representatives of the Emperor jf j
Japan, were conspicuous in the gather
ing.

The American four-masted steel bark Erskine M, Phelps was the great center of attraction In Honolulu on June 14.
The handsome new vessel arrived from Manila on that day and as soon as Captain Graham learned the occasion of
the general rejoicing he had the ship decked from stem to stern. Strange to say the Phelps carried a lot of ballast that
served as a reminder of the days when the United States started forth to conquer the Spaniards. Her hold was full
of old Iron from the hulls of the vessels that were sent to the bottom by Dewey's fleet in Manila Bay. The Phelps was
originally to have gene to New York with sugar, but her destination has been changed and she will come to San Fran
cisco to lead wheat for Europe.

"This Is substantially the same terms on
which the city accepted the Robinson be
quest. The Robinson fund has been in
vested In mortgages on real estate in this
city and county. This money should be
invested In the same manner, but for the,
present I suggest that it be divided among

Â¦will draw Interest."

Board of Public Works Will Submit
Ordinance on the Subject to
Supervisors.
The Board of Public Works sent a com
munication to -the Mayor yesterday re
garding the policy of the board In the
lpatter of old material removed from
streets being repaired. The board ex
plains its action in allowing the architects
of the building now being constructed at
Market and McAllister streets to retain
the old six-inch curbing. The contractors
promised to substitute twelve-inch curb-
Ing and to replace the asphalt sidewalk
with artificial stone, and as the change
was of benefit to the city, the board as
sented. Tha letter continues:
While thlsHDoard assumes the city's owner-
Ship of curbs, it is not enttrely assured as to
the correctness of this opinion. The City and
County Attorney Is asked for his opinion. The
board Is preparing for consideration of the Su
pervisors the form of an ordinance, -which shall
authorize the sale, upon the ground, of old
street material, displaced by new construction,
when the material has not sufficient value to
justify removal and storage for subsequent use.
It will also provide that when property owners
repave at their cost an accepted street, the
cliy may permit; them to take possession of old
material, subject to the discretion of this
board.
TO ALLOW THE SALE OF
OLD STREET MATERIAL
A crusade was started by The Call some
months agQ against scavengers driving
through the streets In daytime with their
wagons filled with refuise and uncovered.
The police were forced to take action and
a number of arrests were made.
Chief Sullivan was waited upon by a
delegation from the scavengers, who
agreed to have a proper cover made for
the wagons, which would be subject to
the approval of the Chief and the Board
of Health. On that promise the cases
against the offending scavengers were dis
missed.
Some of the carts were properly covered,
but the larger . number Â¦were not. 'l*he
Chief drew the attention of the Scaven
gers'* Union to the, fact and at their re
quest an extension of thirty days' time
in which to properly make the alterations
jvas granted/That extension has now ex
pired and the Chief sent the following.or
der to the captains of the different divis
ions yesterday:
The time having elapsed when It was agreed
by the Scavengers' Union that all the garbage
wagons would be constructed according to the
new ordinance ,1 desire you to Instruct the
men under your command that beginning Mon
day, July 2, the provisions of bill No. 97, or
dinance No. 36, on page 463 of general orders,
passed on tha 7th of* May, are to be strictly
and rigidly enforced. All wagons used in the
transportation of garbage must be lined with
zinc, sheet Â¦ Iron or other metallic substance
nnd shall be water tight: and .the covers
must be of oiled canvas and be securely fas
tened at all times, except j when garbage la
being put Into the carts and must be on,
whether the carts are loaded or empty.
The understanding was that when the cover
waa on the wagons it was to be flush with
the top. I have noticed of late wagons going
through the streets and from appearances It
would Indicate that on the garbage they had
placed barrels extending above the top of the
wagon, over which they placed the covers.
This must not be permitted. The top of the
barrel. must not at any time extend above the
top of the wagon. Arrests will continue to be

i.t San Rafael. They made yesterday all
the necessary arrangements to enter
all the Important tournaments In the

pionship at LiOiigwood. as by winning this
they have the right to play at Newport
against the double Western champions,
the winners to play Ward and Davis
â¢ holders) for the championship in dou
bles of the United States. As the
Hardys 1 strongest forte is doubles and
their team work is excellent, it is confi
dently expected That they wjll return as
tliÂ« double champions.
Their tirst tournament will be at Chi
cago, July 9, on the courts of the Ken
wÂ«Â»d Country Club, for the Western
championship in singles; next they will

Freshmen and the Varsity Four-Oar
Crews, However, Defeat the-
Sons of Old Ell With
Ease.
' * - ; .Â¦Â»Â¦Â¦."
NEW LONDON. Conn., June 28.â Yale
won the elght-oared varsity shell race to
day, bpatlng Harvard by about Bix
lengths. With the four-oared and fresh
men races won and handsomely won, too,
and with a lead, when nearing the finish
in the big varsity event, defeat came to
Harvard in a sudden and unexpected man
ner. Harding, the stroke, who had re
placed the disabled Captain Higginson,
collapsed before the three and a half
mtles flag was reached and Harvard fin
ished with seven oars, bo that Yale won
a holloV victory.
The four-oared race, as was expected,
proved rather an easy victory for Har
vard. The crimson crew took the lead at
the enap of the pistol and had no diffi
culty in keeping it. The freshmen con
test was something of a disappointment
to the New Haven men, for the Yale
youngsters had been picked as winners.
Instead Harvard showed them the rudder
for two miles and the event was some
thing In the nature of a procession.
At 11:15 both shells were in position for
the four-oared raceâ Yale on the west side
of the course. Harvard on the east. At
11:45:32 the starting shot was fired and
the two fours were off. Harvard caught
the water first and in much better shape.
With a Jump she pulled away and after
ten quick strokes settled into a beautiful
thirty-six to the minute. Yale rowed a
stroke one point lower. Not once during
the entire two miles was the crimson four
headed by the boys in blue.
At the quarter-mile Harvard led by a
good length. At the half-mile flag- there
was clear water between the two. The
young men from Cambridge were one and
a half lengths to the good.
The water grew rougher as the race
progressed and both crews splashed con
siderably. But still Harvard pulled away
from Yale and during the last mile doubled
her lead to three lengths. With this ad
vantage she crossed the finish line at the
navy yard a winner 13^2 seconds. The
strokes varied but little during the race.
Harvard rowing an average of thirty-four
and Yale- pulling at thirty-two. At the
finish Harvard spurted to thirty-five,
Â¦while Yale went on without increasing
her speed. Neither crew was pumped,
and each cheered the other. Harvard was
the fresher of the two.
The official time of. the varsity four:
Distanceâ Harvard. Yale.
Half mile 3:03 3:13
One mile 6:30 6:37
One and a half miles 10:03 10:13
Two miles 13:22 13: 35 2-5
The two freshmen crews were in their
shells at the starting point just off thÂ«
navy yard when the fours finished. At
12:16 p. m. the word was given. The crlm
eon-tlpped oars caught the water on a
Jump and fairly lifted the shell forward.
For ten strokes it was a case of dig and
get away, and Â¦when Harvard settled
down to the race she led the Vales by
half a length. The lads from Massachu.
setts got the race in hand at the outset
and rubbed it In at every stroke. Har
vard's first few strokes were at a forty
clip, while Yale deliberately pulled thirty,
live. Once well started. Harvard dropped
to thirty-two and Yale to thirty-three.
Open water showed between the two
shells before a quarter of a mile had been
traveled. At the half mile Harvard was
two lengths ahead, with her craft draw-
Ing away. A quarter of a mile farther
down the course it began to look like a
walkover. With the race half finished,
Harvard spurted to thirty-five strokes
but YaJe clung to thirty-two. The crim
son boys entered the lane of yachts ap
proachlng the finish at the bridge with a
rush and swept down the course In grand
style. YaJe waa rowing a beautiful stroke
and gained a trifle in the next quarter.
In the stretch Yale made a desperate
effort to pull up, and did well enough
until the Harvard stroke "caught on."
Then the prospective victors hit It up
again and tore across the line a winnei
by five and a half lengths. The official
time of the freshmen eights:
Distanceâ Harvard. Tale.
Half mile 2:10 2:1Â«
One mile 5:3S 6:03
One and & half miles 8:50 9:07
Two miles ......12:01 13: iÂ» 2-5
An hour's delay was caused by the
threat of a thunderstorm. It dodged the
course, however, and the river became a.t
smooth as a pond. At 1:41 the pistol was
fired. For the third time In the day Har.
yard due the water first and the prcw !
of her boat forged ahead. The start,
however, was an admirable one, and ho
little was there to choose between the
two that only those on the official boat
were able to credit Harvard with the ad
vantage which was really hers. When
the rush of the start had given way to
the four-mile gait both crews were pulling
thirty-six, to the minute.
Down the west bank of the river sped
the shells, with Harvard a fraction of a
length ahead. The oarsmanship on both
boats -was superb. At the quarter Har
vard was fifteen feet to the good, but at
the half Yale was creeping up. The hair
mile flag was reached with a rush and
tha official timers had it that Harvard
was then one and three-fifths seconds
ahead of her, rival. Both were rowing '
cleanly and strongly at a thirty-two clip.
Between the half and three-quarters,
however, there seemed to be trouble with |
No. 6 in the Harvard eight. In the dis
tance it looked like a broken slide, bui
No. 6 was soon at it again and with the
sune rhythmical precision as before.
Yale had gained perceptibly, and as the
line was approached the nose of the New
Haven boat poked itself to the fore. Har
vard waa ready with a spurt, however,
and the boats shot by the mile flags on
exactly even terms, according to the of
ficial watches. The racers sped forward
In amazing style, but as they enteree
upon the second mile the Elis applied a
little of their reserve power. Before Har
vard was aware of It her rivals werÂ«
three-quarters of a length in front. Har
vard still rowed. thirty-two strokes, white
Tale had dropped to thirty-one and had
gained in spite of It.
Now Tale spurted again. This was met
with renewed effort by Harvard. But
Yale clung tenaciously to her lead. At
the two miles Yale, rowing thirty-two, led
Harvard by nearly a length. It began to
look like a Yale victory. Harvard's stroke,
Harding, who took Captain Higglnson's
place after the latter's accident -on Sun
day last, increased the crimson stroke
with a rush which bade fair to take hi 3
colleagues off their nerve. He set a ter
rific clip and the whole Harvard crew
worked like demons possessed. Yale un
dertook to meet the spurt, but the pace
was too hot and Yale wisely decided to
husband her strength for later calls. Inch
by Inch Harvard nulled up, then foot by
foot, and at the three-mile flag the Har
vard shell went to the fore for the first
time since she had lost the lead at the
start Harvard was leading by half a
length. Suddenly there came a break In
the crimson eight. Something was wrong
with the Cambridge stroke. His oar failed
at times to strike the water. A few sec
onds later the Harvard boat quivered and
trembled. Up went Hardlng's oar and
over toppled hfs exhausted body. Cock
swain Wadlelgh pulled his rudder ropes
sharply to one side and shouted to his
men, who did their best to relieve the lop
sidedness of their machine with. its four
to three oars. The beautiful craft swerved
Wlldlv to one side and cries of chagrin and
disappointment were raised.
Poor Hardlnf the boy who was under
the strain of the responsibility placed
upon his shoulders by the Higginson mis
hap, had rowed himself out in that last
heartrending effort to pull up on the Yale
phell. The. young Spartan, disregarding
the fact that during- tha last three days â¢Â¦
he had lost five pounds, had pulled his last
ounce and lay a helpless passenger In
the shell.
He fell into the lap of his cockswain. (
straightened with a heroic effort and
again grasped his oar In a pitiful attempt
to get Into the race once more.
The Yale eight., magnificently strong
and in grand style, tore on Â¦ down the
etretch. Every man. trained' to the hour
for a four-mile race, was pulling beauti
fully and added lengths to their lead, over
their unfortunate rivals. The* ,-Harvard
launch now rushed onrass tha course to J
Yale s Oarsmen Win a Hol
low Victory From the ..
Crimson.
STROKE HARDING
COLLAPSES AND
HARVARD LOSES
Declares That Such Grant Will Be
sult in Great Benefit to the
Merchants of City and
State. â
The consideration of the petition of the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad for a franchise to operate a
steam road on .Illinois street was taken
up: yesterday by the Supervisors' Street
Committee. After arguments had. been
made on the part of property owners who
protested against- the granting of the
privilege Mayor Phelan expressed himself
as being strongly in favor of granting the
franchise.
"On the eve of my departure from the
State," said his Honor, "I desire to say
that a competing transcontinental line Is
entitled to every consideration, and I trust
that the city will act In a broad spirit
upon the application. I believe that such
a competitive service will redound greatly
to the benefit of the merchants of the
city and the people at. large. Such a grant
will insure the regulation of freight traffic
ânot so much probably in the sense of
cutting rates as In the Influence it will
have in keeping rates down and In bring
ing courteous and prompt service from
both competitors. The facilities will be
materially advanced for getting goods to
market. From the high character of the
gentlemen behind the Santa Fe and Its
solidity. San Francisco should give it a
fair chance and equal opportunities. A
vast majority will be greatly benefited, as
It will open up new industries. It will
give value to property where values do
not now exist.
At this point Attorney W. J. Stafford,
representing some protesting property
owners, asked:
"If the Southern Pacific has a legal
right to operate cars on Illinois street
would you be willing to have eight rails
on the street?"
"Yes," replied the Mayor; ''I would not
let the Southern Pacific tracks be an ob
struction to the Santa Fe. It will cer
tainly compensate the property owners
should they suffer damages. I favor the
granting of the franchise under proper
conditions and safeguards."
Those* present at the meeting were:
Mayor Phelan, Captain A. H. Payson
(vice president of the Santa Fe), Attor
neys E. F. Preston, M. Mullaney and H.
J. Stafford, and Supervisors Magulre, Jen
nings, McCarthy, Connor and Curtis. At
torney Stafford opened the discussion by
stating that he was opposed to the ordi
nance granting 1 the franchise being passed
until the company had put down In black
and white what It proposed to do.
"You have no objections to a competing
road?" queried the Mayor.
"Not If It Is in truth a competing road."
replied Stafford. "I doubt, however, the
power of the board to grant the fran
chise."
The Mayor held that there was no ques
tion as to the power of the board, the
point having been settled In the Krakhoff
case in Fresno.
McCarthy suggested that the Santa Fe
might use the tracks of the Southern Pa
cific Company on Illinois street.
â¢ "If you will secure us that privilege,"
said Attorney Preston, "we will with
draw our application for a franchise."
Attorney Mullaney, representing pro
testing: property owners, objected to the
petition for a franchise on the 'ground
that it would be a practical confiscation
of the surrounding property.
"While we feel kindly toward the com
peting line," paid Mullaney, "we should
not be required to give It our property or
subject ourselves to great Injury."
Further consideration of the franchise
was then postponed for. two weeks. .
Attorney Baggett addressed the com
mittee on the petition of the "Bay and
Coast Railway. Compapy for a franchise
on certain streets. He asked to have the
ordinance granting the privilege passed
to print, as it would tend to build up the
city. * The committee agreed to meet to
morrow at 1 p. m. to inspect the proposed
route.
At the request of Attorney Burke of
the Southern Pacific Company, the mat

opinion that Sherman avenue. appears on

MAYOR FAVORS
FRANCHISE FOR
SANTA FE ROAD
The assessment on the franchise of the
Sunset Telegraph and Telephone Com
pany was raised by Assessor Dodge yes
terday to $1,000,000. Heretofore the cor
poration has never paid taxes on more
than an assessed valuation of $2300 on its
franchise. Dodge contends that the con
cern Is exclusively a California corpora
tion, its principal place of business a3
defined In its articles of incorporation be
ing In this city. According to the law as
Dodge interprets it the franchise should
be assessed here.
In estimating the value of the com
pany's franchise credit has been given, for
all sums which It pays into the State as
taxes In various counties of the t-tate.
The Assessor admits that the value of
the franchise as assessed by him added
to the assessment of the corporation hi
all the counties of the State does not
equal the value of the plant as established
by the market value of the securities is
sued by It- The tax on the franchise val
uation will approximate $16,U0U.
Dodge also collected the sum of $5300
from the California Fruit Packers' Asso
ciation yesterday in payment of the taxes
on Its franchise, which he has assessed
at J400.000. This Is the first, commercial or
industrial corporation In the history of
San Francisco, according to the Assees
sor, which has paid taxes of more than
a nominal amount on it 3 franchise. Here
tofore companies of a similar character
have paid only on a small assessed valu
ation. The association has willingly paid
its taxes, recopmizinK that franchises are
taxable under the revenue laws of the
State. 'Dodge declares It to be his Inten
tion not to place a valuation on such
franchises as will be burdensome, but
says it 13 his duty to enforce the laws aa
he finds them. If such assessments ara
Illegal the courts will afford the neces
sary" protection.

There Is but one remedy that will curt
all forms of stomach trouble. EIiECTRO-
ZONE, a liquid internal preparation, i*
indorsed by physicians and people in gen-
eral to be the most effective. It not only
affords immediate relief, but efffcts Â¦ a
positive cure quickly and permanently.
ELECTROZONE regulates the stomach
and puts It In a healthy condition when
It has become diseased.
Disordered stomach Is the cause of the
majority of diseases? that afflict humanity.
The stomach has an important function to
perform. The first Is that of nutrition,
the process by which the food 13 digested,
properly assimilated and transformed into
blood, tissue and vital energy, and this
constantly supplies the waste that is al-
ways taking place In the system, as a re-
sult of what Is consumed in the process
of existence. When this function la Im-
paired by any Â«ne of the diseases from
which the liver, stomach and intestines
suffer- the nutrition of the body Is Im-
paired, the amount of waste that Is con-
tinually going on immediately exceeds tho
quantity of nutritive matter that te a^
sorbed to supply it. and. consequently tha
loss exceeds the supply, the br.<ty Is In a
condition of decline, health falls, emacia-
tion occurs, the blood becomes ' impure
and the system Is in a condition when* it
readily contracts contagious diseases, and
being too weak to resist is destroytM by
them.
Take ELECTROZOXE. It la th? only
remedy that can be relied upon to cure
any form, of stomach trouble. Your drusr-
srist will supply you at $1 a bottle Pam-
phlet will be sent free by the nrXCTRO-
ZONE MFG. CO.. San Francisco.
Few people are free from some farm of
stomach trouble, but rarely two will have
the same pymptoms. The commoner
symptoms are headache, dizzines?, bilious-
ness, sour stomach, irregularity of the
bowels, heartburn, a feeling of uneasiness,
distress after eatlnp, poor appetite, pal-
pitation of the heart, a trembling In the
pit of stomach, loss of flesh, restlessness,
depression of spirits, sleeplessness, ner-
vousness, mental and physical weakness.
a weak and flabby condition of the mus-
cles, a dry and hot, burning skin, vomit-

Mrs. Frank Bradford, wife of the man

at that caravansary last night and the
hotel itself was probably saved from de

Policemen Cleveland Peters and John
Fowle were patrolling their beats when

sciousness. -. _ - . â¢ "-
In some manner paper, in a' waste basket
in the room of the manager of the hotel
became ignited shortly before midnight.
It is believed that a match carelessly
thrown into the receptacle started the
blaze. In the room were Mrs. Bradford
and the nurse girl. Both were asleep.
The flames soon caught the curtains and
the room rapidly filled with smoke and
The nurse girl awoke, but fright and
the suffocating atmosphere rendered her

groped aboutthe room and had not the
strength to summon assistance. All this
time Mrs. Bradford lay In sleep, uncon

Both women would surely have per
ished had it not been for the alertness
of the policemen. Officer Peters was
standing at the corner of Pacific and
Kearay streets and soon discovered the
blaze in the window. Officer Fowle was
soon on the scene, and together they
rushed to the room. The door was locked,

TWO WOMEN
RESCUED FROM
BLAZING ROOM
THE Princesses Bamba and Sophia
Dhuleep Singh arrived yesterday in
H San Francisco from Tokio on the
Japanese steamship Xippon Maru.
; The Princesses are on their way to the
Paris Exposition, and will have com
, pleted the tour of the world when they
j reach Paris, having started from England
on their present journey. They leave San
Francisco to-day and will go directly to
New York.
The first experience of the Princesses
{ Dhuleep Singh with the American inter-
Viewer seems to have amused and amazed
I them considerably. They were seen last
evening at the Palace Hotel, two dark,
slender girls, simply gowned in dark blue,
perhaps 20 and 25 years old, and with a
curious mixture in manner or hauteur and
an English unsophlstlcatlon.
"We are going to Paris." said the
Princess Sophia, "but we really prefer to
say nothing about our trip."
"Do you like America? But it is early
to say â "
"We have met many Americans and
think the women charming," said Prin
cess Sophia.
"And American men â you like them?"
"Xot so much. They work too hard,
and are not the women's equal." and the
representative of the most aristocratic
caste system in the world looked a little
scornfuL
"With you are the women also supe
rior?"
But the Princesses Dhuleep Singh de-
clined to answer further than to say that
the Indian colleges are open to women.
"We have been interested lately here in
a priest from your country. Swami Vive-
Kananda. Do you know of him?"
"No." said the elder Princess, and her
eyelids drooped indifferently over the
brilliant eyes.
"We understood he represented your In
dian Protestant creed, Vedantism?"
"I know nothing of It," protested the
Princess. %
"We In San Francisco have been trying
to do something for your starving people
in India."
"Indeed?" said the Princesses both, but
without one spark of interest and playing
indifferently with the diamonds on their
sender fingersâ ransom of Innumerable
lives in that death-stricken country.
From England to India, touching Cey-
Son. the Princesses came, thence to Japan,
to San Francisco, and they will go on to
New York and to England again, ending
in Paris. They visited in San Francisco
yesterday afternoon the medical depart
ment of the University of California and
were much pleased with what they saw.
They are traveling a la Americaineâal
most â with a French maid only, thesa
Princesses ot the oldest and most aristo
cratic race known to-day. With a marked
English accent and a decided Spanish ap
pearance, it would be indeed difficult to
determine their nationality without the
Hindoo name, but the slim, fine brown
taper fingers are only "made in India"â
and beautiful they are.
THE TWO INDIAN PBINCESSES BOUND FOB PAHIS.
The Hembers Boused to Enthusiasm
by Mention of McKinley and
Roosevelt.
The reunion of the Bear Club held last
evening at B'nai B'rith Hall was a largely
attended affair. Old-time members were
present and created grea,t enthusiasm by
referring to past campaigns wherein the,
Bear Club had taken a prominent part.
The remarks of E. I. Wolfe. Edward S.
Solomon and Judge H. C. Dibble created
great enthusiasm. They referred to the
tn&ny successful campaigns the Bear Club
had participated in and predicted that the
club, under ite banner Inscribed with the
names of McKlnley and Roosevelt, would
once again march to victor/.
Alfred Bouvier. chairman of. the Repub
lican County Committee, addressed the
members and was cheered to the echo
â¢when he mentioned McKinley and Roose
velt as the forerunners of a wave of pros
perity. The club will hold weekly meet-
Ings and its drill corps, under compete.it
instructors, will be brought to Its former
Etate of efficiency.
The officers of the Republican State
Central Committee are paying special at
tention to the fluty cf advising county
committees throughout the State as to
the proper course to be pursued to obtain
recognition on the official ballot. The re
quirements of the primary election law
are explained and demonstrated to all
applicants for information. The corre
spondence of the committee on this sub
ject is cnite extensive.
It is the purpose of the State committee
to open the campaign In Septemberâ not
later than the ICah of that month. Be
tween now and then particular attention
Â¦w-lU be paid to the enrollment and regis
tration cf Republican voters.
It Is supposed that Congressional nom
inations on the part of Republicans will
be made before the 10th of September.
TcÂ« conventions will organize at Banta
Crux on August 2S and some of the nom
inations will doubtless be made then and
there.
The indications are that Eugene F.
T<oud will be renominated and re-electe-1
!n the Fifth District. It is conceded that
Julius Kahn will be renominated in the
Fourth. Democrats talk of putting up
Judge Coffey to run against Mr. Kahn,
but the Judge has not signified a desire
to enter the race. ~
Republicans expect to gain a Congress-
Can in the Second District. The appoint
ment cf Marion de Vries to the position
of United States Appraiser eliminates
from the district the strongest Democratic
material. The Democrats talk of nom
inating A. Caminettl of Amador or Joseph
Sproul of Butte. The Republican senti
ment of the district seems decidedly favor
able to the nomination of Coltmel E. A.
Forbes of Marysvtlje. Judce J. M. Wall
ing of Nevada City is mentioned as a Re
publican aspirant. Stockton is ready to
offer S. D. Woods as a candidate and
Placer is prepared to present J. N. Kul

Reports from the south are to the effect
that J. C. Xeedham will be renominated

Hurricane Bouts at the San
Francisco Athletic
v/AUUÂ»
Gameness and Earnestness the Chief
' Features of the Sport Present
, ed to the Followers of
the Ring.
Half the boxing bouts in the gymna
sium of the San Francisco Athletl9 Club
last night were stopped by Aleck Greg
gains, the referee, at the instance of Ser
geant Coogan of the police. This was a
precautionary measure, as no one was
damaged, but those in charge took no un
necessary cbances. All the bouts were
good, but for hard hitting and gamenesa
the last on the programme took the palm.
The principals in this fight. were Frank
Nlcholls and Burt Omines, "They fought
at ISO pounds and for four rounds slugged
at a fast pace. Nlcholls' left eye was
closed in the second round, but he came
back and evened up 'matters. The judges
could not agree at the end of four rounds,
so it was declared a draw, the police re
fusing to allow it to continue.
The gymnasium was packed to the
doors, every available inch of space being
used.
The -first brace of .boxers in the ring
were George Finn'egan and Joe Hill, each
weighing 105 pounds. Hill had a slight ad
vantage in height and reach. His smaller
opponent made-up for this in gameness
an# aggressiveness. In the third round
they fought all over the ring as fast as
though a championship depended upon
their efforts. In the fourth round Hill
proved too strong for Finnegan and
knocked him out.
Jack Hart and Pat Dugan started off In
whirlwind fashion, displaying more energy
than science. There was hardly a clean
punch delivered. but the spectators
howled with delight at the wild swings
and the wrestling which marked the bout.
There was never a dull moment from
start to finish. There were calls for an
extra round. but Referee Greggains
called the contest a draw, the boys being
too tired to box another round.
T. Sullivan, a miniature of Tom Sharkey
in build, was matched with Joe O'Leary.
a tall, lathy youth. It seemed as if the
latter would be knocked out of the ring,
but he proved a clever boxer and with
stood Sullivan's rushes. He closed Sul
livan's left eye and slowed the latter's
pace for a time. Sullivan was the stronger
and knocked O'Leary down several times
In the second round. , Referee Greggalns
then stopped the bout as O'Leary seemed
too frail to withstand the battering he
was recefvlng.
Eddie King and J. Spooner went at it
hammer and tongs and It was apparent
the bout would not last long. Kxpecta
tlons were fulfilled as King, proved so
much the harder hitter Referee Greggalns
stopped the fight after the men had been
at it less than two minutes. In this time
Spooner acquired a black eye and a pair
of unsteady legs;
Frank Wall and Jack Harrlgan started
proceedings quietly in the first round of
their bout, although Wall found time to
shed a tooth. The second round was
faster, while the third was a whirlwind
affair. Wall had decidedly the better of
this, punishing Harrigan severely. Har
rigan tired perceptibly and showed an In
clination to stop. Referee Greggalns gave
the bout to Wall on aggressiveness.
â¢The' bout between >;. Bacig-alupi and j
Brady was more of an animated cakewalk
than a fight. Neither could land an effect
ive blow, but they tried their best. In the
third round Brady -went down â¢ to avoid
punishment and Referee Greggalns finally
stopped proceedings, giving the bout to
Baclgalupi.
In the bout between J. J. Phlpps and
Gus Salsbury It seemed only a matter of
a few moments when one or the other
would go down and out For four rounds
it was give and take, each being pun
ished badly. Phipps was the stronger
throughout and an extra round was or
dered. In this Salsbury commenced to
play for the body and took much of the
steam out of Phipps. Toward the end of
the bout Salsbury landed three right
swings which dazed Phipps. The decision
went to Salsbury.

c WARNING FOR THE FOURTH-
AMONG the preparations for the celebration of*
the Fourth of July there must be arrange
ments for guarding against fire as far as pos
sible and for -promptly extinguishing it in case it
should occur. Such preparations should be made
not only by the municipal authorities, but by every
householder.-
San Francisco has had marvelously good luck in es
caping up to, this time any such thing as an extensive
conflagration, and the same kind fortune may con
tinue to attend her for years to come, but it is not
safe to count on it. We have never had a big Fourth
of July fire such as has destroyed many millions of
dollars' worth of property in other cities, but a very
little-carelessness may cause one here as it has caused
them elsewhere. It behooves us, therefore, to
be watchful and to take every precaution against the
danger.
Fire constitutes one of the greatest annual wastes
in American cities, as it docs in American forests.
In the Forum for July William J. Boies of New York
states' that, in 1899 the property destroyed by fire in
the United States exceeded the sum of $150,000,000,
and figures are given of losses thus far in the current
year which justify the estimate that the fire loss for
1900 will be upward of $175,000,000. Every city in' the
country will contribute. to the loss, no matter how
careful thepcople and how vigilant the Fire Depart
ment may be, and it is safe to say a considerable part
of each city's contribution will be made as a result of
carelessness on the "Glorious Fourth."
Owing to the fact that our summers in San Fran
cisco are not dry and parched as in the East, and to
The Boxers of China, it is said, drink their own
blood mixed with wafer. It is reasonably certain that
nobody would object if they drank the red fluid undi
luted.
Arother ftrike is on in Havana. If the Cubans
cannot prove their assimilation of American methods
i?j one way they can in another.
It begins to look as-if the bloody warfare in South
Africa is nearing the beginning of the end. General
Roberts and General Botha have descended to the
harmless practice of writing one another letters.
The ability with which a local Chinese unearthed
the robbers of his household suggests that Chief Sul
livan might to advantage make his detective force
a little more cosmopolitan than it Is. r -
The burglar who made such a spectacular display
in a Mission household has evidently missed his voca
tion. He would have earned greater success as a
writer of melodrama.
William Jennings Bryan is convinced that he should
have in two Vice Presidential nominees two tails to
his political kite. He probably thinks that in his
approaching campaign flight he will need something
very unusual to keep him from getting off the earth.
Asylum scandals are following one another in
rapid succession. First it was Ukiah, and now it is
Agnews. His Excellency the Governor appears to
be' overlooking an opportunity to make one of those
spectacular investigations to which he is so partial.
The thirst of some Berkeleyites must be of that ex
travagant variety which will stop at nothing short of
satisfaction. The saloon-keepers are trying now to
destroy even the courts that the glass which cheers
may be filled.

willing to accept it, for he doesn't drink, but the
sight of a Democratic convention debating an anti
whisky platform would be one of the tjiings that
would give an air of hilarity even to a graveyard.
That, however^ is not to be the only offer Bryan
h to receive, if all reports be true, for it is said the
anti-imperialists are to make him a proffer their
support provided his convention hurl damnation at
anybody who suggests a continuance of- our flag in
the Philippines. Here again Bryan will doubtless be
willing to accept, for he is ready to hurl the lashing
of his tongue at almost anything that exists,- but just
how he is going to get Morgan and the Southern
delegates to consent to such a'plank is not apparent.
By way of making room for one or perhaps both of
the proposed planks, Jacob Ruppert Jr. of New York,
who is now in Kansas City making arrangements for
the delegation from that State, is reported to have
declared in favor of dropping the free silver plank.
He is quoted as saying: "There are so many issues
more important, that I think free silver need riot be
mentioned at all. The party; in the East will not
stand for Jree silver."
Here, then, are all the elements, required to make
chaos â¢come again and settle down on Kansas City
like a thousand of brick. What. would it 'profit Tam
many to have the .silver plank excluded and a pro
hibition^ plank put in its place? How will the South
like a suppression of the free coinage proposition in
order to make room for a quotation from the Declara
tion of Independence to the effect that governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the gov
erned; that 'Filipinos and negroes have a right- to
vote, and that, whoever deprives them of such rights
h,a villain whom it were base flattery to call a tyrant?
The one wise Democrat in the land is Henry .Wat-,
terson. who has given notice that platforms are worth
nothing and that he doesn't care what is put in his.
Hcwould accept the prohibition offer as willingly as
Bryan, andthen take a drink of straight Bourbon 10
the success of the ticket.' A Democratico-Populo-
Prohibition ticket would make a good toast in any
man's mouth, and Watterson is just the man to whoop
it up.. Whether there would be a million votes in the
country for such a combination is doubtful, but ex
periment is '.'â¢ worth trying. The Democratic
donkey is so heavily loaded" already that one more
bag^of sweepings wouldn't hurt him much, while
sight of the animal so burdened would be to the popu
lace as good as a circus.. As a matter of fact a coali
tion of Democrats and Prohibitionists is something
the country would like to see, and the. scenes that
would follow as the members of the allied hosts tried
to affiliate would make the campaign a season of un
interrupted gayety.-
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
mLL-E. RELJDA, the California
soprano, has recently achieved a
distinguished success In "Lakme"
at the Opera. Comique, Paris.
Miss Relda is a pupil of Mme.
Colonne, the wife of Director Colonne of
the famous Colonne concerts, and Is cred
ited in Paris with a rarely beautiful voice.
Ellen Beach Yaw, well remembered here
as the "altitudlnous soprano," Is also in
Paris, studying with Mme. Marchesl. Miss
Yaw has entirely abandoned the field of
freak vocalism and under the able tuition
of Marches! has succeeded in achieving
a full round tone throughout, her voice
at the same time retaining almost the
whole of her extraordinary compass. In
the "Rose of Persia," written around
Miss Yaw by Sir Arthu/ Sullivan, and in
which she attained, a considerable success
last season, London probably saw Miss
Yaw's last appearance on the comic opera
stage. She will hereafter devote herself
to more serious work. "^ '

they brought a . freight bilj which, con

to scenery the company's effects were of
the Elizabethan order as regards sim

both excellent from a musical standpoint

Prior to making ; Shanghai his home he
was a master mariner and since that
time became famous as a wrecker in Chi
nese waters. He floated the Pacific Mall
steamship wrecked, off Hongkong in 1874,
and during the following year commenced
what proved to be the greatest feat in
wrecking on record. This latter was thq
locating of the wreck of. the Pacific Mall
steamer Japan, which had been burned ,to
the .water's edge and sunk in the open
oca in twenty-one and ahalf fathoms of
water. There was 1340,000 in treasure on
board and Captain Roberts was employed
by the underwriters to recover it- It took
him from January to the latter part of
September to locate the wreck and, three
years elapsed before, he was successful ' in
securing all' the money. Â¦

THE RESTORATION OF POLAND.
SOME citizens of Prussian Poland are on trial in
a German tribunal for high treason, charged
with plotting for the 'restoration of the king
dom of Poland- The very name of that nation has to
this generation a far-away sound, and to plot* for its
restoration seems as fantastic as to scheme the re
investment of the Assyrian empire and the restora
tion of the gauds and glories of Babylon and Nine
veh.
The destruction of Polish monarchy and the par
tition of that state were acts used as a text in the les
sons of liberty which were taught the people of the
world during the last century. In its day this destruc
tion of one of the oldest states of Europe was re
garded as such a crime that the nations guilty of it
ventured no defense. Southern Europe owed as
much to Poland as to France for checking the inva
sion of Islam. The defeat oMhe Mahometans at the
battle of Tours by Charles Martel was said to have
saved the modern wor'.d from being entirely Ma
hometan, and had Abderrahman defeated Mar
tel that day the Koran would now be expounded in
the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and our
Puritan forefathers would not have been Puritans at
all, but rather Impuritans. judged by our existing
standards of morality. ;
Be this as it may, it is certain that Mahometanism
would have been carried by the Turk far up the
Danube had it not been for John Sobieski and his
army of Poles, who raised the siege of Vienna and
beat back the hordes of Turks which invested it.
Bat the very nations which benefited by Polish valor
were the first to forget the debt While it is not a
foundation for pessimism, it is not without interest
as bearing upon the change th2t has come in popular
sentiment, that the partition of Poland would excite
less aversion now than it did when the crime was
committed. The order that reigned in Warsaw, where
Suraroff "created a solitude and called it peace," has
been established in many places since. England is
endeavoring to confer it upon the Transvaal and we
are working at it in the Philippines. The old lesson,
like others that fed the spirit of patriotism, is fading
more and more. The funeral of Poland seems so very
long ago that the trial of these men for treason be-
C2use they dreamed of restoration of that kingdom
sounds like trying the invader of the tomb of Aga
memnon for body-snatching.
THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
REPORTS submitted at the meeting of the mem
bership committee of the Pacific Commercial
Museum on Tuesday were to the effect that
up to that time 168 firms have signed the rolls as
members, and that a sufficient number of promises
have been received to assure a membership of 175.
Thus but a little more exertion seems required to
bring the membership up to the 200 mark, which has
been deemed necessary to perfect the organization.
The enterprise is one of considerable magnitude,
and it is perhaps for that reason some firms in the
city hesitate to take part in it. The very magnitude
is, however, one of the best assurances of the success
pi the movement, if it can be once started. Large
bodies are difficult to put in motion, but once the
motion has been given they go forward thereafter
largely through the force of their own momentum.
It is safe to say that if San Francisco establishes the
museum on the scale that has been projected it will
soon attract to itself support not only from all parts
of the coast, but from other sections of the Union as
well. Such was the experience in Philadelphia, and
there is no reason to doubt it will be repeated here.
coming.
A Pacific museum is needed by the commerce of
the country to supplement the great institution that
has proven so beneficial on the Atlantic side of the
continent. That much has been asserted by the Phila
delphians themselvesi Thus what is undertaken here
will be in line with a widespread demand, and its
movement will be aided by a well nigh universal im
pulse. The one thing dependent upon San Francisco
is to start the ball rolling. The world helps those
who help themselves. Let us establish the Pacific
museum, and aid to maintain ie will -soon be forth-
If we are to have the museum at ajl,it can hardly
be worth while to point out to intelligent merchants
and manufacturers the importance of starting it at
once. Events in the Orient are moving forward with
startling 'rapidity. In the present Chinese crisis there
are forces at work which may bring about a dismem
berment of the empire, and it is certain that out of
the disturbances will result a much larger opening
for foreign trade with all parts of China. This, there
fore, is the time when action will be most profitable.
It is to be hoped the full membership required for
organizing the association and getting to work will
be enrolled promptly. Every progressive and enter
prising merchant and manufacturer in the State
should be among those who will have the honor of
launching a movement calculated to be of such vast
benefit to all.
mISS JOHANNA FRISCO, orang
outang, of the Chutes, is dead.
She perished in a fire which de
stroyed a part of the building
adjoining the "Casino," on the north side,
yesterday. The fire broke out shortly be
fore noon, and when . the flames were
Quenched the great Simian had breathed
her last.
, The building in which Johanna met her
death was one used as a lodging by the
Chutes employes. A room In it was oc
cupied by Ed Rabe, an animal keeper. He
had under his care the orang-outang and
a cage of valuable Australian finches. The
latter were recent arrivals and had been
placed there until accommodations co*ud

the animal, refuse to be comforted ami

friend.
Johanna Frisco was Imported here
about a year ago. She was quite young
and one of the cleverest Simian perform
ers since the famous Joe Storms. In the
Darwinian Temple an elaborate bedroom
was fitted up for her, and here every
night her trainers put her through an ex
hibitton which made the audience look at
one another and think of Darwin's teach
ings. She was In perfect health and did
not show a trace of consumption, to
which all her predecessors had fallen
early victims. The management will try
to replace her, but such another will be
hard to find.

to a crisp in their wire cage.
Johanna Frisco,' like ail her species, did
not take kindly to the cool Pacific
breezes. She was on that account kept
in Rabe's room. To keep up the required
temperature a gas stove was kept, burn
ing night and day. ; In some way the go
rilla, whose cage was only a short dis
tance from this stove, must have dragged
some curtains and bedding into the burn
ing gas jets. The flames, thus started
spfead rapidly, and If the flre had not
been discovered early a very serious con
flagration might have resulted.
Kabe was walking in the grounds when
a cry from Gatekeeper Ike Willis directed
his attention to the building, from which
clouds of smoke were pouring out of door
and windows. - .... Â»_
Without a moment s hesitation he
dashed Into the place, but he had scarcely
crossed the threshold when he fell, over

Another keeper named Spellman rol

Just as the firemen arrived on the scene
and dragged Rabe out. The rescue of the
orang-outang came too late. Poor Jo
hanna had been suffocated and no amount
of skill would ever restore life to her.
When Spellman heard that there was no
hope he burst into tears.
"There never was one Hke her, he
cried. "I taught her Ydl she knew. Now
she's dead." Â¦Â» I.T "Â«_ ?.Â»

THE CHINATOWN PROBLEM.
BY the Public Improvement Central Club there
has been adopted a set of resolutiolis calling
for the appointment of an advisory board of
one hundred reliable business men to thoroughly in
vestigate Chinatown, to submit plans for the enforce
ment of sanitary regulations within it, and also for
the ultimate removal of the Chinese from their pres
ent location.
The resolutions are an evidence of the condition
of public sentiment caused by the ill-advised attempts
of the Board of Health and the Federal quarantine of
ficer to quarantine Chinatown under the pretense of
the existence there of the bubonic plague. They afford
a striking illustration of. the eagerness of the people
to rid San Francisco of a district which, if not afflicted
with pestilence, is none the less a nuisance and a
menace to the community. For that reason they are
entitled to the earnest consideration of thoughtful
citizens, and will doubtless receive it.
Whether or.no it shall become needful to appoint
such a committee depends upon the Grand Jury now
in session. That body can investigate Chinatown with
more authority and therefore more satisfactorily flian
a committee of one hundred could do it. Before the
Grand jury all doors must open; any evidence it de
sires to obtain by the examination of witnesses must
be given under oath, and its report must be made with
official responsibility. The Grand Jury therefore can
dc much more than the proposed committee in the
way of inspecting the quarter," and it has the further"*
advantage of being able to file complaints against
those who violate the health ordinances, and thus lead
to their indictment, instead of having to content it
self with submitting recommendations, as the com
mittee would have to do. It is therefore to the Grand
Jury the public should look primarily for action. If
the jury do its full duty there is every reason to ex
pect the enforcement of the sanitary laws in China
town will speedily follow. Should it be otherwise the
people will know the reason why. and upon whom the
The project of bringing about a'Vemoval of the Chi
rese habitations to another quarter of the city is one
of great magnitude, but if well considered plans to
that end be devised they would undoubtedly be re
ceived with favor by an overwhelming majority of the
people. It is probable, however, that if the sanitary
regulations of the city be enforced a removal of a
considerable proportion of the Chinese population
from that district will follow of itself, because many of
the buildings are now overcrowded. Moreover, if the
quarter has to be cleaned up and kept clean, the own
ers of property there may find it profitable to re
move the foul old buildings and replace them, with
tenements which will bring better rents. Much of
the big profits obtained from the buildings at present
is due to the fact that the sanitary laws are not en
forced, and when they are enforced the property
owners may find it necessary to make improvements
in self-defense. ;< >-/~
The Public Improvement Central Club is on the
right track, but there is no occasion yet to forestall the
Grand Jury. Let us see what that body wfll do in the
way of enforcing the law, and then we shall have a
clearer perception of what will have to be done by the
people themselves. /

JUDGE BAHRS' decision in\ the Fresno rate
case is in line with public expectation and is a
victory for the law over the Southern Pacific
Company. The Judge holds that the Railroad Com
missioners had jurisdiction to hear and determine the
complaint of the plaintiff in the case, that the law
which prohibits the raising of rates that have been
fixed for competitive purposes is not in violation of
the Federal constitution, and that if the railroad com
pany deem the rates fixed by themselves for competi
tive purposes to be "unreasonable and confiscatory"
the,remedy lies in an appeal to the Commissioners.
In accordance with' that reasoning the court issued a
final and perpetual injunction forbidding the company
from exacting from the public any higher rates than
those fixed at the time the Southern Pacific was com
peting with the San Francisco and San Joaquin Val-
ley Railroad,
The decision is based upon a provision of section 20
of article XII of, the State constitution, which de
clares: ''Whenever a railroad corporation shall, for
the purpose of competing with any other common
carrier, lower its rates for transportation of passen
gers or freight from one point to another, such re
duced rates shall not be again raised or increased
from such standard without the consent of the gov
ernmental authority in which shall be vested the
power to regulate fares and freights."
The evidence heard before the Commissioners at the
time the complaint was under investigation was con
clusive that the law had been violated. The Southern
Pacific Company had reduced its charges for the pur
pose of competing with the Valley Road, and later
had undertaken to raise 'them without obtaining the
consent of the Commissioners. Thus the decision of
Judge Bahrs is in accord with the law and with the
facts, and while an appeal has been taken to the Su
preme Court, it docs not appear that the railroad
company has any ground on which to win unless the
court should hold that section 20 of article XII of the
State constitution is in violation of the constitution of
the United States.
The case is notable because it is the first instance in
many years in which the Railroad Commission has
been of any service to the people. In fact, that it has
proven serviceable in this case is something of a sur
prise, and doubtless was as much so to the railroad as
to the public. Should the Supreme Court sustain the
decision of Judge Bahrs the railroad will have to
apply to the commission for leave to restore the
higher rates that prevailed before the monopoly was
broken by the building of a competitive road, and
we shall then see what the service of the commission
is really worth. In the meantime it has achieved one
victory for the law and the people and deserves credit
for it.
TfiE FRESNO RfITE CASE.
JOHANNA FRISCO MEETS HER
DEATH IN EIRE AT THE CHUTES
the slowness with which our principal building.timber
ignites and consumes, we have less risks to run than
other communities, but; nevertheless, we have enough.
We have a Fire Department of which we are justly,
proud, and every' member of it can be relied upon to
do his duty, but all of these advantages are not
enough to assure immunity from danger. In the general
jubilation of the national holiday there* will be more or,
less risk of firejn all parts of the city. Not a single
building can be said to be absolutely safe from it. It
therefore becomes the duty of the citizens "to co
operate with the municipal authorities in guarding

"On the beach it was just CO per, cent

staked out and the owner had left the

Mrs. Winter's Perilous Trip.
About the only Interesting thing among
the cargo of the Portland was an Esqui
mau dog. This animal was brought all
the way Vrom the Mackenzie River. A
Mrs. Winter and her husband had been
wintering at Herseittl Island among the
whalers when the news of the Cape
Nome strike reached that "uttermost part
of the earth." They at once purchased
v trade"â the Esquimaux designation of
goodsâ from the whalers and with the
"trade" purchased dogs and a guide from
the Esquimaux. Over the ice and snow,
following the trail made by Mate Tilton,
when he brought out the news from the
frozen-in whalers, they made their, way
to Nome and. were right in the thick of
the excitement when the Portland sailed.
Mrs. Winter sent the pick of her team to
San Francisco, and he is one of the hand
somest Esquimau dogs ever brought out
of the frozen north, not barring* even
those which Lord Lonsdale brought back
after his famous trip.
The Portland will only remain a few
days in port. Just as soon as her out
ward cargo can be put aboard she will
sail again for Nome and York.
STTTP THAT CAME FROM NOME AND ONE OF THE PASSENGERS.
There are at least half a dozen claimants
for every location on the beach, and every
saloon, restaurant, millinery etore, wash
house and lodging house has been let and
sublet until no one knows where he
stands. When the Portland sailed the or
iginal owners had arrived and were as
sertifTg their claims. Free fights were of
dally occurrence. Women and children
had been thrown "on the beach" without
a cent. Men who had paid their last cent
to get a start and found they had been
fooled were polishing up their guns.
Gamblers who had bought locations rt
fused to move, saloon men had armed
guards at the doors of their resorts and
all in all there were prospects of livel>
times. Â¦.
Captain Lundquist Gives News.
In talking about the trip north yeater
day Captain Lundquist said: "The trans
port Rosecrans, ..formerly the hospital
ship Missouri, was on the mud flats sixty
miles south of Nome when we started for
home.' The vessel was in no danger un
less a gale came up, and then I- think the
crew would have been In no danger.
"The steamer Charles Nelson had a
hard time "of it in the ice. and finally had
to put back to Dutch Harbor. The vessel
was not damaged, but while she was try
ing to find an opening through the ice
her previsions gave out and she had to
put back. It was she that reported the
Rosecrans on the mud flats.
"The Charles Nelson got back to Un
alaska on June 18 and the chances are
that she is now at Cape Nome.
"There was only a small supply of coal
at Dutch Harl^or and Unalaska, but many
coal vessels were expected, so there will
be no shortage.
"All that was left of the bark Alaska
when we left Nome was her port bow.
She was driven ashore during a hurricane

i only an ounce of gold. Even that ounce

I Captain Lundquist's watchchain. Of the
j five passengers on the steamer some were
Russian missionaries and the others were
men who wintered at Dutch Harbor. The
steamer only lay a few hours at Nome,
as .Captain Lundquist's instructions were
to get back to San Francisco as quickly
as possible. That accounts for the fact
that no treasure came down on the
steamer, but the company expects at
least a million on the St. Paul.
"What a man gets hold of up there he
keeps, and in many instances keeps it at
the point of a gun. Restaurants, lodging
houses, saloons, stores, barber-shops and
in fact all kinds of businesses were left in
the hands of agents last fall while the
owners went to San Francisco for the
winter. These agents have sold the places
and cleared out with the money. Now the
original owners are appearing on the
scene and there are 'razors in the air.'
"On the trip from San Francisco to
Nome we had a passenger named Morton.
He owned a fine restaurant and lodging
house at Anvil City when he left for home

Steamers Change Hands.
There is some question as to where the
Californian will go on her maiden trip.
She was originally intended to load here
for New York -via Honolulu, but John
Rosenf eld's Sons want her to make a few
trips for them on the coast, and the Gov
ernment wants her to make n few trips
to either Manila. Honolulu or China. Just
where the big steamer will go is. still in
doubt, but one thing is certainâ if she
does not enter the Government service she
will make a few trips on the coast for
Rosenfeld's Sons.
The largest merchant Fteamer ever
| built in this State, the Californian, had
her "engineers' trial" on the hay yester

Californian on Trial.
Schooner Americana Safe.
The Nippon Maru brings the news that
the long-overdue schooner AmeWcana 1%
safe at Honolulu. She started tor San
Francisco nearly four months ago and the
local owners and insurance people were
very much worried over her long trip.
It is now learned that owing to light
winds and calms* the vessel could not
make any headway for this port. Finally
when the provisions and water began to
get short Captain Perry squared away
tor Honolulu, where he arrived June 14.
By that time the men were in a bad way
for want of water. Two days later, when
a full supply had been got aboard, an
other start was made for San Francisco.
â¢ Among the San Francisco Insurance
men there was $22,000 on the hull. $12,500
on the freight and $44.<X>0 on the cargo, so
it is no wonder there was 'a sigh of relief
when the news of the arrival of the vessel
at Honolulu reached here.
Complaint was filed with the Collector
of the port yesterday by Survej'or

At the beginning of this century educa
tion was well established in the hearts
and convictions of the American people.
There were twenty-four colleges in the
country â five Congregational, two Presby
terian, three Episcopalian, one Baptist,
one Catholic and twelve non-sectarian.
Â¦ The most Western was the State insti
tution at Nashville. In nearly all the
European colleges State systems were de
veloped, but State supervision where It
had been tried had generally been a fail
ure and city supervision was unknown.
The monitorial system of Bell and Lan
caster was attracting attention; higher
education for women did not exist, and
girls whose schooling extended Into the
'teens attended private schools and sem
inaries of a very primitive and Inadequate
type. The question of _ training teachers
; was almost as little known am were phy
sical training and school hygiene. The
I textbooks of the period were few and
reading for children was meager and
mainly religious. There Â¦were prac.tica.lly
no associations for teachers. High school
work was feebly represented by the local
or private academies. The country dis
trict school represented for the great body
of the population our educational system.
Generally taught In the winter by men,
and in the summer, when the older chil
dren were needed at home, by women, \t
was attended by children and youth up to
the age of 21. The work was ungraded
and all done by one teacher. The studies
began with 'the alphabet and primer and.
included sometimes even astronomy and
surveying. Grammar was taught usually
by parsing standard works of poetry hi
English literature, like "Paradise Lost"
or Pope's "Essay-." Declamation and
sometimes debates, especially in evening
spelling schools, were very prominent.
Evening lessons on the constellations, col
lection and analysis of plants, elementary
anatomy and physiology, singing and in
struction in Latin were occasionally given
In the district school, ilost cf those who
sought a higher education were on the
way to the ministry. The ideals which
sustained and animated education were
chiefly those of good citizenship. Sunday
school work was largely catechetical for
the younger and Biblical for the older
classes.
In turning from this general condition
of thlng3 a century ago to the present
the changes are bewildering. Perhaps the
first of all is the growth in numbers, size
and material equipment. Now there are
409,000 teachers and 15,(00,000 pupils, and
the school expenditure has grown to $200.-
WO.OOO. School buildings have vastly im
proved. Especially within the last few
years there nas been a great renaissance
in high school buildings. In many places
these ample and tasteful structures are
the best and most costly buildings in the
town. Attendance for a compulsory period
is enforced in mdst communities by truant
laws and in some by truant officers. All j
this growth in bigness and numbers ap- i
peals powerfully to the average American
mind. Along with this the sentiment on
which education rests has strengthened
and deepened. Perhaps on no great topic
is there such a universal consensus as in
the belief in the public school system, and
at the close of the century this conviction
shows no sign of weakening.
One of the earliest movements which
marked the advent of the century was
the development of centralizing tenden
cies, the dangers of which had been well
discussed in the constitutional debates.
In 1805 the Public School Society of New
York was formed, but not until two or
three decades later was there any great
advancement in supervision. Now not
only every State and city has its super
intendent, but in many parts of the coun
try the smaller towns are grouped for
this purpose. Although still " in many
places a political office, the benefits of
supervision have been incalculable in edu
cating teachers, bringing uniformity into
methods, securing co-operation between
home and the school, etc. Already there
are manifest' tendencies toward making
this office more and more a profession
with all that that term implies.
At the beginning of the century teach
ers were isolated, but under the influence
of Horace Mann, in the forties and fifties,
associations. State and municipal, and
finally national, have arisen, which bring
teachers together for exchange of Ideas,
give them an esprit de corps, enable them
to listen to the best and latest facts and
suggestions of leaders, besides provldiog
healthful and needed recreation. â¢ It is to
be regretted that a few of our State bod
ies, and even the national association,
while perfecting their organizations and
drawing great numbers of teachers, show
;signs of manipulation by educational ma
chine men which makes them less attrac
tive to academic leaders and does not ex
clude second-rate, commonplace pro
grammes. But this danger can never go
far enough to work great harm with such
teachers as frequent th^se meetings.
Professional training has grown stead
ily, especially since the normal school pe
riod, just before the middle of the cen
tury. Mo/c recently pedagogical depart
ments in colleges and universities have
contributed to raise the professional
standing of the teacher's work. Normal
instruction gravitates by an Iron law to
ward formalism and excessive method
ology, but for those who study tenden
cies in a large way these dangers are
trivial and temporary. Even those who
insist most strongly upon the necessity
of radical reforms, in normal work do
not for a .moment Question the great
value of these institutions, even at their
worst. We can hardly doubt that the
close of another century will see educa
tion a profession which will rank as high
as any in the quality and amount of spe
cial training required. The public senti
ment, which doubted fifty years ago that
increased efficiency could be thus'secured,
has now practically vanished.
The matter of education has changed.
The three R's are reduced to very modest
dimensions during the first ye"ars. and a
bewildering multiplicity of other topics,
if they have not already entered the
schoolffoom. ore knocking at the door.
For the upper grades, even through the
college and, university, this is still more
the case. The general feature of this
change is the growth of science.
Rudimentary physics in the form of
natural philosophy was taught at th^ be
ginning of the- century, but chemistry,
biology, geology, meteorology and botany
are essentially creations of the present
century and Involve radical changes n#t
only of matter but of method. Owing to
this marvelous expansion of the filed of
education, the elective system.- which
Thomas Jefferson had incorporated in the
University of Virginia early in the cen
tury, has been modified and amplified so
that now the elective system in college,
high and occasionally grammar school is
rapidly breaking down all trace of the old
fashioned courses. In their place we find
manifold groups and curricula, and nearly
two-score new academic degrees in which
Latin and Greek are not required. * In
place of the old uniformity we find a di
versity that fits every individual need,
taste and capacity, thus making the
school a life and career-saving station
for many a boy whose special gifts were
not only undiscovered but suppressed by
the ol<! procmstean method.
This has necessarily involved more care
ful scrutiny of different tastes and gifts
and the widest individual diversity has
been found. Those who excel in one kind
of work are usually deficient in others,
hence grading cannot be uniform and edu
cation must give more and more place to
individual methods as befits a republic.
This again .has led to the study of inter
ests Which "are the first manifestation of
talent, and" 'all -these tendencies lead to
and culminate, fn child study, which in
sists upon a definite survey of health and
aptitudes., ' The greater the talent the
earlier it appears, and it Is well that the
elective system is slowly working its way
downward to lower grades and necessi
tating more individual psychology. Tech
nical and industrial education la mainly
the product of. the last two qr three dec
ades of rtie last century-. The active pow.
ers are enlisted and muscle work Is rec
oernlzed as never before: even athletic
excesses are- tolerated, because 1Â» is felt
that thus certain Insidious temptations of

training brings the school into clos-r rnp

EDUCATIONAL ADVANCE IN 100 YEARS.
Copyright, 1900, by Seymour Eaton.

and chiefly religious 100 ypara ago. and
now child libraries and courses of read-
Ing abound everywhere. On the Â¦whole thÂ»
quality of these works Is improving* MO3l
of the great literary classics of the worM
from antiquity down are now popularised
for children and occasionally introduced
in supplementary courses. While fxcfw
here Is possible and an overbooklsh child
Is always more cr less monstrous, this
tendency, too. is essentially pond.
At the bottom of the educational sys
tem the kindergarten has lately presented
itself and in some places has been incor
porated as a part of the "public school
system. Rightly understood and carried
out Jt is a most valuable addition, but tha
better tendency now is to keep it waiting
until It has be*n rescued from meta
physics and made, first, more healthful.
and. second, more natural.
One of the most important movements
which this century has witnessed Is thÂ»
development of higher education for
women. Formerly excluded from all thÂ»
colleges, they are now admitted in most
colleges and universities of the world a*
a late woman's '"Minerva" shows. Col
leges exclusively for women of a grade of
work equal to those for men have been
established at various points, and no am
bitious girl can complain that her educa
tional privileges are not, now essentially
as good as those for men. Just what tha
result of higher education for women is
to be the future must determine. Whether
collegiate work is especially to train
teachers and the unmarried minority who
desire to earn their own livelihood, flr
Â¦whether such training is to be mainly for
mother* and wives. Is not yet apparent.
In place of the twenty-four colleges of
1.300 we now have nearly 4."0. including
thosf of all rank 3 which claim the r.atne
or a\-Â« decrees. ThÂ». most Important
group of these new institutions are the
State universities, the best of which ar*
already powerful rival? of the Institutions
best endowed. These institutions flourish
especially in territory not settled or even
owned by the Government a century ago.
The distinctively university movement
which seeks to add a higher story to our
educational system has fjrown up within
the last twenty-five years. At a dozen or
more centers row preparation for tha
chief university degree of Ph.D. is riven
and there are two institutions Â¦which have
even dispensed with all undergraduate
work. This culture of non-professional
specialization or the home training of pro
fessors is a movement that appeals very
strongly to the national pride, which does
not wish to see the apex of our education
al system in Germany or elsewhere in
Europe, and to the personal pride of'the
professor who wishes It understood that
he can guide graduate as well as under
graduate work. University students have
for several years co-operated first. In an
nual meetings: second, in the publication
of a handbook, -and the present year has
seen the first association of representa
tives of American universities.
Finally, professional training has been
radically modified. Most noteworthy ara
the changes in medicine, represented now
by some threescore Institutions, not more
than three or four of which have much
endowment. Law schools, most of which,
still labor under very trreat disadvantages
and are struggling with poverty, have,
nevertheless, improved and prolonged
their courses. Theological schools, which
are the oldest, have, nevertheless, expand
ed their curriculum and increased their
efficiency, especially in the study of an
tiquities and sociology.
On the whole, probably no aspect of our
national life can present a record of prog
ress greater or more Impressive than that
of education. More important than any
of the individual changes enumerated Is
the growing desire everywhere to secure
and to wield the power of knowledge.
Children are sent to school earlier: youth
linger later in postgraduate courses; all
work harder than ever, aad perhaps tha
one chief source of solicitude as we sur
vey the progress of the century la the
suggestion. What would be the result if
so much sedentary book work, such strain,
upon eyes, brain and hands under artifi
cial conditions, which bring youth during
all the years of its immaturity into condi
tions so .radically different from any
which the race has known before, shouiij
gradually work toward the deterioration
of national life? What if we are laying the
foundations not for the dark ages asjairi.
but for a new sickly age. of the race? Yet
here again the new attention to hygiene
and all the different forms of, motor edu
cation bid us hope.

CHICAGO. June 28.â There are nearly four
hours to the regular sessions of the Board of
Trade and those hours to-day were occupied
principally In getting rid of recently acquired
wheat. The market opened lower because
Liverpool was down and the long pressure was
on the market. Under a Â¦ demand from Wall
street and the Northwest and come covering
by ehorts the market regained the initial dip
and this and a lot more was lost later. Local
longs of the influential type started In the
market In the weakened condition and simply
choked up the opening through which much
; high-priced stuff has recently . disappeared.
Outside longs on the decline Joined the ranks
of the sellers and the market became so one
sided that lt dropped 4*>4c with only momentary
checks. The bottom was reached near the end
of the session and covering by shorts caused a
little recovery, but not sufficient In amount to
relieve the market of the charge of decided
weakness. The August option was the more
active, although July was anything but slow.
August closed 3?fcc down at SlVic. July closed
3%e lower at 80c There were rains In North
Dakota and Manitoba, but private advices from
these sections and other parts of the stricken
Northwest did not vary much from the recent
tone. The Price Current made the total esti
mated crop, winter and spring, 650,000,000
bushels, 200.000,000 bushels of it spring, com
pared with Statistician Snow's estimate of 460,
000.000 bushels. It declared that with the re
serve supply the crop would be equal "to the
demand and that the crop yield would be 5 per
cent higher than. the average for the past five
years. However, crop considerations general
ly were overshadowed by the selling, which ap
&eared to be the result of a general desire to get
out before the price get any lower. *
Corn was rather quiet, but considering the
Â¦wheat weakness lt wae firm. August closed
J >i<g%c depressed at 43% c. July closed Â»4c lower
at 42">tc.
Oats were steady early, but yielded some
later out of sympathy with wheat, July closed
%c lower at 24*>4c.
Provisions were weak, despite light hog re
ceipts. A drive was made at pork by longs
and the whole list, as usual, suffered. Â¦ The
wheat weakness was a factor in the decline.
There was a fair cash demand, but It was not
equal to the task of sustaining prices against
the influential selling of to-day. At the bot
tom the market steadied on covering by shorts
September pork lost 22% c down and lard and
ribs %c down. â¢

the relief of Admiral Seymour's party caused a
slight fluter In the markets here .to-day, but
operators were soon absorbed again in the un
certainties of the situation and the market re
lapsed Into stagnation. - â¢ -
Americans gee-sawed within narrow limits
and dealings In them were meager.
The bank sold. Â£11,000 gold in French coin
and lost Â£20,000 to the Continent. A large busi
ness was done in loans at 3% per cent. There
were no discounts to speak of, a fact which
was regarded as significant In view of the
absence of an increase in the supply of other
securities shown in the bank returns. Bills
accordingly were down. it has transpired that
the recent buying of silver was not by
the Government, but by local houses on account
of the monsoon and the Chinese difficulties, but
Government buying is expected at any time.

Grand Master Pntton began the core
monies after the opening ode to the tune
"America" had been rendered by ihe fol
lowing quartet: H. SI. Baker, Charles
Keypter. William Coates and William
Grossman.
"I need hardly say how much the Oran 1
Lodge appreciates the efforts of Alcatraz
Lodge in its work for the progress of.
Masonry." Bald the grand master. "We
are proud of this lodge hall and trust that
for many years you may meet here an<l
enjoy the prosperity which you deserve."
The ritualistic ceremonies wore duly ob
served. After Worshipful MastPr Miles
Searls Jr. of Alcatraz Lodge had made
the formal request for dedication at tho
hands of thf Grand Lodge the grand
master accepted the duty. Grand, Chap
lain Church delivered an invocation and

moral and Intellectual, qualities of your
members Bhall be advanced Masonry will
have attained one of Its greatest objects.
Here great good, can be accomplished in
the* Masonic pathway of life. Meet here
and cherish the principles underlying your
order. Unless Masonry makes better men
of us It Is of little use. If higher aspira
tions for good are here conceived and
higher notions of man's duty to himself
and to his fellowmen are born then Is Its
object a grand one. .
"The purpose of thla edifice is to pro
\*lde a place where you may not only
etudy Masonry for Its forms and cere
monies, designed only to keep out the un
worthy, but that the great principles
Â¦which govern and control Masonry may
be Inculcated more deeply Into the lives
of those who are of Its mystic ' brother
hood."

ALAMEDA, June 28.â One hundred men
were thrown out of employmentÂ»by the
closing down to-night of the" Pacific Coast
Borax Works, controlled by , "Borax
King" Smith. The works will remain
closed for an indefinite period, six months
at least, this being the first time in their
history that every employe has been let
out.
Two reasons are given for the closing.
From one of the men it Is learned that
the stopping of work Is due to an exor
bitant raise In the freight charges on the
crude borax from Death Valley to the
works at West Alameda. It seems the
Southern Pacific Company raised the
rate without warning from $fi 50 to $29 a
ton. which, of course, the borax works
people refused to pay* This extraordi
nary boost of rates went Into effect on
the 6th Ins:. The borax people refused
to foot the big bills, and failing to secure
an adjustment from the railroad company
decided to close up everything on this
coast and ship borax to their new works
In New York.
Superintendent John Ryan pleads Igno
rance In regard to the difficulties ovft 1
freight rates which exist between the
two corporations, although he admits that
there are some differences which they are
trying to regulate. He account for the
wholesale discharge of men by stating
that it was done because of the comple
tion of the big borax refinery In New
York which was commenced two years
ago.
"I understood the people. I represent
were trying to get some concession from
the railroad." said Superintendent Ryan,
"but Just what It Is about I don't know.
We have been gradually letting men out
.since we started up two months ago.
Most of our refining Is done in New York
now because the rate from the borax
mines to that point is cheaper than it is
to San Francisco."
ThÂ« borax works have been receiving
about 900 -tons of crude borax from Death
Valley each month. A rnlse of $22 50 a
ton In freight is a prohibitive figure and
means a big sum to the borax people.
Until they can get this figure reduced
they will keep the works closed up.

BpeclaJ P!s;>atch to The CaJl.
SAN JOSE. June 2S.â All persons and
business men who were members of the
local Board of Tra-ie on August 27, 1837,
are threatened with a suit for 57 15 each,
their pro rata liability on a doficif-ncy
judgment held by Patrick Holehan
against the board. To-day they received
circulars to the effect that unless they
called on Charles P. Owen, the agent of
Holehan. and paid thHr share of indebt
edness on or before July 10 next suit
would at once be brought agn.lr.st them
for the liability and costs. Some 200 mem.
hers ere thus affected.
This financial difficulty dates back t*
the big rose carnival in IRS7. There was
not quite enough money raised to com
plete the carnival pavilion, which cost
nearly JCOOO. and in order to finish the
building the Board of Trade borrowed
12000 from Holehan and gave a mortgage
on the structure to secure its payment.
The board expected the money Â¦would be
readily forthcoming and that the rent of
the structure would eventually pay the
Indebtedness. Instead no Income has
been derived from the building.
A short tirr.p aero Holphan foreclosed
his mortgage for $2000 and interest, and
at the salo he bid the pavilion In at $1000.
leaving a deficiency of $1406 05. Now he
Is about to bring suits against the some
200 members of the Board of Trade at
that time for ?7 15 each to meet the de
ficiency. Many of the members receiving
thÂ« circulars to-day say they will pay
their share rather than contest it.
Holehan also threatens to tear down the
building and sell the lumber, thus leav
ing San Jcse without a building large
enough In which to hold a fair or other
large gathering. The building stands on
leased ground in Agricultural Park.

The plan cf the American Foresters
with their new building was a bold one.'
They took a lease of the old Acme Club
building, with all of its gymnasium appa
ratus, which was left behind when the
A,cme Club consolidated with the Reliance
Club. They determined to give their
members all the benefit of the gymna
sium, baths nnd rooms of the Acme Club
In connection with their membership in
the order.
In order to do this a board of directors
was formed, consisting of H. A. Luttrell.

ing them all of the privileges of a club
for this small monthly fee. Only mem
bers of the order will be sriven this privi
lege, but no member will be compelled
to Incur the additional expense unless he
desires to do so.
The regular dues are 11 a month, which
give the members all the sick benefits and
insurance of the order. For one-half of
this sum additional the club privileges
will be extended. â¢ '
This plan has caused many to join the
order in order to avail themselves of the
privileges of the new hall nn<! fcymna
pium. It has had the dosired effect in
that It has stimulated interest in the For
esters and brought much new material
Into the various camps.
The board of directors will manage the
building for the benefit of the four affili

the cost of operating the building It will
be divided amone the courts.

that city.
Dispatches from Denver declared that
Dr. Coyle was to receive a call to thÂ©
pastorate of that church. \Vh!le not flat
ly admitting that he wa3 intending to
leave Oakland, there was a strong Infer
ence to be drawn, from his remarks to
day upon the subject. He said that he
would not be very much surprised If a
call did come and that if It did he would
accept it. Dr. Coyle paid further:
"I did not go to Dpnvpr as a candidate
for the pastorate, but to satisfy persist
ent demands of some friends. I was ask
ed to preach there when I returned frnrr.
the New York Ecumenical Council. The
people did not make me a definite offeK
I would not consent to that. So far as
any change Is concerned, that is a matter
for consultation first with my family."
It is rumored that if Dr. Coyle departs
his brother, Rev. Campbell Coyle. an abla
clergyman, will be a candidate to succeed
here.

Charge of Disturbing the
Peace.
Mrs. Lily Scharer. the divorced wife of
Louis Scharer. pawnbroker, on Market
street, near Polk, went to his store yes
terday morning, accompanied by her
daughter, a girl IS years of age. Mrs.
Scharer proceeded to give her opinion of
Echarer In strong language and finished
up by smashing his showcase and other
things Policeman Xolting was called In
and Mrs. Scharer was taken to the City
Prison, where a charge of disturbing the
peace was booked against her. Her daugh
ter went with her. but Scharer declined
to make a charge against her.
Scharer said that he had been annoyed
by the woman for years and he had borne
it without a murmur, but he was getting
tired of it and thought It was time she
was taught a lesson. The daughter went
to the warrant clerk's office to ball her
mother out. but owing to Mrs. Scharer's
condition it was deemed advisable to de
tain her in prison till the afternoon, when
she was released. She said that when she
quarreled with Scharer she always be
came hysterical and did not know what
she was doing.
THE monster benefit for the Sweerfey
fund comes off to-day and the Grand
Opera-house is to be the . scene of
Â¦what will probably prove to be the
greatest grathering ever assembled within
the walls of a local playhouse.
Although all returns are not yet In and
ffubscriptionp to the noble caure continue
to accumulate It is now almost an as
sured thlnjr that 115.000 will be placed to
the credit of the widow and cfeildren of
the brave fireman.
Mrs. Bweezzey Is deeply gTateful for whatf
the public is doing for her anS hers. It
is a RTfltitude that she can find no words
to express; It has an outlet in choking
sobs and tears.
"Everybody has been so good to us all,"
she said last night. "I am so very grate
ful, but I can find no words in which to
express all I feel.
"I have not thought at all yet what I
rhall do with the money," she -went on to
explain. "I have had so much else to
think about. I only know that I should
like to get a comfortable little home
where the children would be happy. 1
know nothing whatever about business or
the handling of large sums of money. I
would not want to handle the money
carelessly, so I hope that Chief Sullivan
will take charge of the fund and invent
it as he thinks wisest and best. 1 have
only one desire In life, to do what Is best
for the children. Their father left them a
noble heritage, a name that is honored
by all, and 1 want to do everything for
them bo that they may be accredit to
that name."
Yesterday afternoon the artists who are
to take part in the monster benefit had
a dress rehearsal and everything -went
without a hitch from start to finish. The
Musicians' Protective Union has signified
its intention of helping along the splendid
programme and will send a band of thirty
pieces' to assist Walter Jones in his great
"Sousa" act.

In addition I -would state that Army and

The Alcalde Drill* Corps. Captain John
Staude. has adopted a beautiful uniform,
which It will display in the parade. It
is of dark blue with white trimmings and
