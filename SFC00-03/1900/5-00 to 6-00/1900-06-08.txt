Two Charges Hade.
There are two distinct charges made by
the Grand Jury against Mr. Dalton,
though both of them grow out of the per
sonal property roll matter. The Indict
ment is upon the charge that Mr. Dalton
destroyed one of the assessment books of
the county*In order to protect himself
from the liability for uncollected taxes.
The accusation upon which his removal
from office is asked is that Mr. Dalton
did not perform his duty as Assessor and
enter upon the personal property roll the
names of all of those In the county who
possessed personal property and collect
taxes thereon.
The Jaw requires the". County Assessor
to collect the personal propejty taxes of
thÂ© county, and In order to. force the col
lection of these ;taxes' a' penalty was im
posed, making the Assessor and his
bondsmen responsible for > all the uncol
lected taxes upon personah property. It is
charged that In order to shield himself
from this liability that - the County As
sessor destroyed the memorandum books
In which his deputies made' the 'original
assessment of the - personal property -\ of
the county, and it is specifically- charged
that he destroyed one book entitled the
"Oakland : City Assessment: Roll of Per
sonal Property for the Year, 1339."
The accusation is based upon another al
leged effort to avoid this liability for the
uncollected personal property taxes. It is
charged that the Assessor did not enter on
the "' personal property, roll of :. the ; county
the names of those who became delinquent
upon their personal property" tax and that
this v.-as done to avoid the liability under
this law.* *
District Attorney Allen's Statsrnent.
District Attorney Allen, who drew the
documents and who will have to prosecute
them in the name of the county, said to
night:
"Both of the proceedings hinge upon the
law in regard to the collection of personal
property taxes. This law contains a strict
provision intended to, force the collection
of these, taxes,' and the actions depend
upon the constitutionality of this law. The
personal property roll of the county 13
practically made up from the stubs of the
receipts for personal property taxes. As a
matter of protection the Assessor doe3
not enter upon the personal property roll
ihe names of those who do not pay their
personal property taxes, even though they
may have been assessed. The indictment
is based upon the destruction of a per
sonal property book that was supposed to
contain the names of those owning per
sonal property on which taxes had not
been paid. Everything depends upon the
legality of the clause Inflicting a penalty
upon the Assessor for non-collection."
The Indictment.
The essential charges In the indictment
are: Â¦ _v

OAKLAND, June Â».â The long expect
ed and much discussed repcrt of
the 'Alameda' County' Grand Jury
was handed to Judge Greene of the
Superior Court this morning, but was not
made public until afternoon. In order that
the District Attorney might be given timi*
to prepare a warrant upon the Indictment
found and to prepare the accusation
against Assessor Dalton so that It could
be served.
The Grand Jury had been called to meet
at 10 o'clock this morning, but. though
the Jury was ready to report last Tues
day, It found that there was still . an
hour's business to be done, and District
Attorney Allen was closeted with the
Jurors for that time. It was approaching
the noon hour when the jury finally filed
Into the box and Foreman T. L. Barker
arose and presented three paper?, two to
Judge Greene and one to District Attor
ney Allen.
One of the' documents handed to the
Judge was the formal report of the Grand
Jury, and the other was evidently an in
dictment, but those present in the court
room missed the value of the third paper
and supposed that.lt was merely a copy
of the report until District Attorney
Allen, late in the afternoon, announced
that he had served upon County Assessor
Dalton an accusation by the Grand Jury
and a suit to remove him from office.
It was this latter, act "that surprised
everybody, .for while the Indictment was
generally expected, that; the Grand ' Jury
should go still further and order "suit to
Grand Jury Presenting 1 Its, Report to Judge Greene.
â¢"^rOTTN'TT Assessor Henry P. Dilton was indicted by the Grand Jury of Alameda County yesterday for
the destruction of one of the prrsonal property rolls of his olHce in order to avoid ths liability imposed
ty law for failure to collect all personal property taxes. The Grand Jury at the same time presented
an accusation against County Ass:ssor Dalton, ordering the District Attorney to bring suit against hin to
oust him from of5cs for failure to prop;rly prepare the personal property rolls of the county and. to prop
erly collect the psrsonal property taxes.
Mr. Dalton no^v has ono civil suit against him to recover the fees received by him for preparing
the assessment roll of the City cf Oakland, a suit has been ordered instituted against him by the Board
of Supervisors for the commissions upon the poll taxes withheld from ths county, and now is to bs addsd
a suit to rrincve him from offica and an indictment for destroying public records.
Mr. Dalton makes indigncnt denial of any criminal actions, announces his intention of forcing all
of these suits to an early issue, and charges that every one of thess is a political move intended to in
jure him.
Perhaps not the least incident in a day of sensations is the charg3 that is mad? to-night by Mr. Dal
ton's organ that Superior Judg2 W. E. Greene, in whose court the Grand Jury was acting, ordered these
indictments.
Inquisitors Also Demand His Removal From

LONDON. June 7. â Anxiety respecting events in the Far East is
greater to-day than yesterday. Over and over again I heard the opinion
expressed that nothing can prevent wnr between Japan and Russia. In
diplomatic circles nothing else is taiked about. There now exists an ex
dteinent among diplomats such as has not besn kno"sra for years and
which, has entirely eclipsed all attention hitherto given to Ts-ar in South
Africa. A visit to the city revealed an increase in anxiety. There exists
in financial circles all the preliminaries of a panic, which sentiment has
affected all markets and quite neutralized the anticipated effect of the
good news frcm South Africa.
It only needs little, if anything- can bs judged from to-day's ap
pearance, for a very serious break in prices to take place. Public senti
ment is urging the Government to take a more active interest in the Chi
nese developments. All day long communications were going on be
tween the Foreign OQce and Tientsin, and generally the situation is
regarded as more serious.

ger's powers are regarded at? ample, but
he is not expected to take action in the
matter of dispatching military expeditions

equivalent to a declaration of war on our
part. In adhering closely to Its old-time
policy of abstention from Interference
with internal matters in China, especially
by refraining from entangling movements

that it can properly care for all the legiti

evidence of how keenly tho powers a?

Tith the v'.evr of securing co-opcr3tlon in

Bounded as to such action by any power,
there are cany rumors that such steps
are under consideration. A member of a

Is certain the British Foreign OScc is
contemplating scndlns instructions to all
Its ministers to secure the support of

would have for its ulterior object the frus

bor for making capital out of the present
troubled *tate of affairs in China. This
statement the Eritish Foreign Office cate
gorically and emphatically droies. But
even If the denial is prompted by motives
cf policy, it can be said without reserve
that Great Britain will take no action on
her own initiative beyond the mere pro
tection of her own subjects. No public
pressure could ir.duce Lorrf Salisbury to
enter into further complications until the
South African war is finished.
But the tone of the British press is in
s-cnif contrast of tho official attitude. The

Transvaal President Tells "Why
He Fled From Pretoria and
i Declares the War Is Not Over
by Any Means.
T ONEON, June 8.â The Daily Mail publishes this dispatch from Its
J 4 special correspondent:
LOUEENZO MARQUES. June 7. â President Kruger and bis gov
ernment are still at Machadodorp, \rhere it is statsd a stand will be
made with probably twenty to twsnty-five thousand men. In view cf the
present circumstances it is not probable that the defeated Boers will re
tain means or courage to move their army north, although the more des
pcrcte wish to do so. A number of British prisoners from Waterfall
have been moved to Novitgcdacht.
Trains are still arriving froin the Transvaal with straggling 1 paa
sengcrs.
LONDON. June S. 3 a. m.â Th? execu
* tlve offices of the Transvaal Gov
ernment are in a railway car.
J which is shunted on a switch at
Machadodorp station. President
Kruprer caused the interior of the coach
to tw? reconstructed some time ago with
a view tn contingencies that have now
arrived. The correspondent of the Daily
Express who went from Lourenzo Mar
<iue3 to pee President Kruger was received
yesterday. The President sat smoking a
long pipe. He looked worried, but his
bearing was quiet and determined. He did
not make the least objection to being in
terviewed. The correspondent wa3
equipped for the interview by cables from
London, "
"Yes." said President Kruger, "it is
quite true that the British have occupied
Pretoria. This, however, does not end the
war. ThÂ« burghers are fully determined
to fight to the last. They will never sur
render so long as 500 armed men remain
in the country. I feel deeply encouraged
by the fine work Stpyn and De Wet are
tioin:? in the Free State."
The correspondent, suggested that the
war was over, inasmuch as the capital
had been taken.
Where the Capital Is.
"The capital!" explained Mr. Kruger
with energy, "what is a capital? It does
not consist of any particular collection of
bricks and mortar. The capital cf the re
public, the soar of government, !s here In
this car. Th*?re fs- no - magic- about any
special site. Our country is invaded, it
is true, but it is not conquered. The Gov
ernment is still effective."
Referring to the reasons why he left
Pretoria. Mr. Kruger said:
"I was not foolish enough to be taken
prisoner. 'I provided thi3 means of loco
motion precisely for the same reason as
our burghers supply themselves with
horses when they take the fleM. It U
necessary that I should be aW? to move
quickly from place to place. That is all.
By and by this car will take me back
to Pretoria. For the present it enables
me to keep av.ay from Pretoria, where 1
coul'J be of no service and where I should
only piay into the aands of the enemy."
"They "say. Mr. Kru?er," remarked the
correspondent, "that you have brought
with vou gold to the value of ii2.00O.WJO?"
"It is not true/' replied the President.
"Whatever monetary lesources 1 may
havc with me are simply those which we
require for state purposes. At the same
time I am not going ta tell you wftere
our treasure is. Let Rpberts tind It II he
Kruger Will Not Flee.
"They also say in London. Mr. Kruger.
that you contemplate taking refuge on a
Dutch man-of-war at Lourenzo Marques."
"That is again a lie," retorted the Presi
dent with vehemence. "1 know of no
such. Dutch war vessel. I am not contem
plating refuge anywhere. I shall not leave
my country. There will be no need of my
doing anything cf the kind."
The correspondent said, "Then. sir. there
Is much surprise at your having left Mrs.
Kruger behind."
President Kruper replied: "But why?
Mrs. Kruger is quite safe in Pretoria. She
would oniy be put to personal inconven
ience here. All communication between us
Is stopped, of course, but she will await
my return with calmness and courage.
She is a brave woman. I am here awaiting
further information. We are surrounded
by faithful burghers nnd are quite safe."
Secretary of State Reitz remarked:
"You may depend upon it that the war Is
not yet over. Guerrilla warfare will con
tinue over an enormous area. We intend
to flght to the bitter end and shall prob
ably retire upon Lyndenburg. where we
can hold out for many months."
"Yes," observed Air. Kruger, "It 13 only
row that the real struggle has begun. I
fear that there will still be much blood
shed, but the fault is that of the British
Government."
Then raising his voice to an almost pas
sionate height Mr. Kruger exclaimed:
"The time has passed for U3 to talk. We
have done plenty of that, but it has done
us no good. The only thing left for us to
do Is to keep en fighting, to keep on fight
ing."
The correspondent who secured the in
terview telegraphed It direct from
Machaddodorp station yesterday, when
the wires were working as usual to Lou
renzo Marques.
The Daily Express in commenting upon
the Interview refers to the "unabated de
fiance of the chief of the Transvaalers."
Nine hundred British prisoners arrived
Tuesday at Nooitgedacht. They were
penned In a barbed wire fence of four
acres on the open veldt.

and created a sensation.
The warrant upon the indictment was
served by Deputy Sheriff Wales, and Mr.
Dalton at cnce furnished a bond in the
sum of J100O, with H. H. Havens and A.
J. Reed as sureties. Mr. .Haven is a re
tired attorney and brother-in-law . of the
late F. K. Shattuck and A. J. Read is the
foreman of the mechanical department of
the Enquirer. Â¦->.'%"'
Later the accusation was served upon
Mr. Dalton by Deputy Sheriff Welch.
The San Francisco Call.On the other hand, it is understood that
Judge Greene, when conferring with the
Grand Jury, as he did by their request,
advised them that they ought* to find the
indictment. Â¦ :.-.- *
â¢ Judge Greene was shown the Enquirer
statement in regard .to his alleged re
sponsibility for the Indictment, and when
asked to make a statement said:
"I only advised the Grand Jury upon
matters of law, and never upon the mat
ter of whether they should indict or. not.
That is an act that the Grand Jury alone
can perform.
"As to the insinuation- that the giving
of : the 'report 'to. the public was delayed
for any special reason, I have only to say
that the law requires that when an in
dictment, is' found neither-, the; clerk
of the court nor the grand jurors nor: the
Judge shall divulge the name or docu-
Jn the courtroom Immediately after the
1 report of the Jury was known, one of the
; deputies of the District Attorney said to

Jury that there was nothing in the chaige
and has counseled it against bringing In an

the Indictment of Dalton.
One of the important features of the
situation is a statement made In the En
quirer this evening which involves Judge
Greene, who received the report. The En
quirer Is the organ of County Assessor
Dalton, and it makes the direct and spe
cific charge that Judge Greene was re
sponsible for the indictment pf the Asses
sor. This Is likely to be a serious matter,
for Judge Greene does not allow such im
putations to stand against him, and the
cases will come to trial in Judge Greene's
department of the Superior Court. This
is the statement from the Enquirer:

Immediately after, the wedding cere

were driveji to the handsome residence. of
Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Alexander, which
is situated on the side of the hill just
overlooking the picturesque lake of Tuxe
do. This Is a spacious house with rooms
of generous dimensions and has attractive
verandas.
The bridal pair, with their attendants
and members of the two families, took
their places in what is known as the-liv
ing-room, a beautiful room in white and
gold and hung with Gobelin tapestries,
its windows overlooking the lake. After
brief and Informal congratulations the
wedding breakfast wan served, tables be
ing placed on verandas and all over; tho
lower part of the house. Huge clusters of
pink and white peas decorated each table.
The entire bridal party was seated at
one oval table in what is known as the
new library. . In the center of this table
was a mound of. orchids and one^.of Its
ornaments was an artistic loving cup, an
heirloom of the Cary family of Virginia,
of which the bridegroom's mother, is a
member. This cup, of colonial times, fol
lowing the conventional design of straw
berry, is inscribed with the Cary coat of
arms and the date 1772. Since that date
it has done service st weddings and chris

Gown of the Bride.
Miss Crocker's wedding gown was a
dream in point lace, "satin and mousselinc
de sole. A whisper has gone forth that
the exquisite point lace used in the mak
ing of it alone cost $20,000. Miss Crocker
would be the last to mention the price of
anything she wore, but it would be just
like her to order a gown never before
equaled.
Brought up by a grandmother of the
old-fashioned kind in the strictest econ
omy; allowed pin money of only $50 a
month until two years ago; forced to buy
her bicycle on the installment plan, it is
no wonder this heiress to a fortune of
$4,000,000 .has been lavish ! in expenditure
since the money was placed in her care
on September 7, when she became of age.
The gown is rich white satin, but the
bodice looks as if it were entirely of point
lace, and the skirt is combined with filmy
mousseline de sole.
The skirt is made with a front breadth
of white satin, with Inserted accordion
pleatings of white mousseline de sole at
each side. These pleatings are very nar
row at the waist line, but broaden out
gracefully as they near the hem. They
are trimmed with a soft jabot of point
lace, mingled with a vine of orange blos
soms. The trailing orange blossoms reach
from the waist line quite to the hem of
th The k lonV white satin train is untrimmed.
At the waist the satin is arranged in
graceful corrugations, which unfold grad-
U The bodice is made with a transparent
vokc entirely of the very valuable point
lace. The lace is also draped over the
white satin corsage in graceful berth.
The sleeves are one of the unusual feat-
ures of the costly wedding gown. They
are made entirely of point lace and are
close fitting, made very long, reaching
nearly to the finser tips.
Miss Crocker wore no gloves. Her veil
was of point lace and even more costly
than Miss Clark's, which was valued at
$4000. The veil fell well over the long
train and was caught with orange blos
soms where it was draped on the head.
So exquisitely fine is the lace that it looks
as if it were made by fairies instead of
mortal fingers. ,â,
This lace-trimmed robe of Miss Crocker
will set an entirely new fashion in wed
ding gowns. I
Miss Crocker's going away gown is dark
blue crepe de chine. It Is trimmed with
bands of satin in a lighter shade of blue.
One of her house gowns looks like a
cloud of lace. It is all a mass of real lace
in narrow. insertions and tiny frills, and
the lining is white chiffon and white lib
erty satin. "

ALAMEDA GRAND
JURY HAS INDICTED
ASSESSOR DALTON
MURDERER WILCOX THROWS
OFF MASK OF INSANITY
Being "Warned by His Brother tns
Prisoner Quickly Besumes Hie
Former Attitude.
SANTA ROSA, June 7.â A most remark
able scene was witnessed in Judge Ben
nett's court to-day immediately after thÂ»
close of the trial of Wife-murderer
George F. "Wilcox. Scarcely had the last
juror passed through the door into the
jury-room when WUcox threw off the
mask of insanity "he has worn ever since
..is arrest.
Throughout the long trial "Wilcox sat
with bowed head, trembling and shifting
hands and feet, his glance bent on his
shoe tips or a dirty piece of shirt he alter
nately folded and unfolded, a perfect pic
ture of a nervous wreck. This demeanor
lasted until the case went to the jury, but
the metamorphosis came when the last
juryman had passed into the Jury-room.
As the lock clicked, and while the people
in the courtroom had their eyes turned
full upon him, Wllcox suddenly straight
ened up, raised his head. and. calling a
deputy Sheriff to him, asked for a chew
of tobacco. "Sit down here," he said,
and then began talking freely, rationally
and with garrulousness. He talked of his
trial, of the witnesses, and was rattling
away In perfectly connected sentences
when Harry Wilcox, his brother, came
strolling up to the group. He listened a
moment, then said excitedly:
"For God's sake. George, get on to your
self; you may have another trial."
Ofle of "Wllcox's attorneys also appeared
on the scene about this time and whis
pered a warning to the prisoner.
Instantly his manner changed, his voice
was stilled and he was a dejected, quiv
ering human wreck. Indifferent to his
fate, unconscious of his surroundings.
After being out thirty hours tho jury
was at a late hour to-night taken from
the courthouse to a hotel, where they
were allowed to retire/ A deputy sheriff
was left to guard the door. Before they
were taken from the courthouse the jury
asked to be discharged. The foreman
stated that an agreement seemed impossi
ble. Judge Bennett, however, said that
Inasmuch as the trial had been a great
expense to the county he was desirous of
securing a verdict, and would, therefore.
eive them further time to consider the
case. Rumor ha? it that the jury is unani
mous for conviction, but that three jurors
are standing out for life imprisonment la
stead of the death penalty. -

who stabbed John Norby at Tiburon last
month, was to-day held over to the Su

to-day claimed that Norby has since his

ments until the party accused Is under ar

could be taken than the one follewed to
day.
"All of these statements are merely
made to create sympathy, and 'are with
out foundation In fact.
"I notice also that the Enquirer attacks
the grand jurors and the finds. as there
sult of political bias. That attack is un
just and unfair, and I believe that the
Grnnd Jury acted with great earnestness
and intelligence in the performance of
their duty." j
BARKER DENIES BIAS.
T. L. Barker, the foreman of the Grand
Jury that found thft indictments, was in
dignant when he. heard of . the charges
made by County Assessor Dalton.
"Mr. Dalton's. statement that I was ac
tuated by bias in this matter is ridicu
lous" said Mr. Barker. "Besides I was
only one member of the Grand Jury, and
there were eighteen others, 1 and it is un
fair to those other gentlemen to. say that
1 influenced the Grand Jury against him.
I only did my duty, and there is no rea
son why a Grand Jury should . not find
an Indictment, if they deem the; matter
worthy of indictment, against one county
official as against another.. Mr. Dalton
has been violating the law, and he will
admit to any one that ha has. been so
doinjr. We could do nothing else under
the circumstances but act as we did, fÂ«r
this violation was deliberate and with his
lull knowledge.
"It Is unfair and unjust to that Grand
Jury to charge it with political bias. I
know that many of the members were
personal friends of Mr. Dalton, and most
of them were, I think, his political friends.
I know that one gentleman on the jury,
who is his warm friend, said to me: .'I
will regret all the days of my life that
I was on thi3 Grand Jury and that I
will be compelled to take this step, but I
can do" nothing else under my oath as
a grand:Juror.' Â¦ I think that - every memv
ber of the Grand Jury felt, that-way, and
1 know that I did."
MAY BE TRANSFERRED.
What will be done with the cases is a
question. The accusation will have to be
answered on June 19 in Judge Greene's
department of the Superior Court. It is
generally believed that the cases will be
transferred to another' county, for it
would -.be extremely idiracult- to. get; a jury
in 'this" county, "so partisan la.' the. general;
population -of the county.- There is hardly

BURXHAM-STANDETORD CO.. Washlncttm
and 1st sts.. Oakland, or Builders' Ex., a. F.MILWAUKEE. June 7.â After one cf the
most spirited sessions ever held by the
General Federation of Women's Clubs the
long discussed question of reorganization
was defeated to-day by a vote of 43$ to
VSS. So lively was the discussion that at
times there was a score of women on the
fioor demanding- recognition. But not for
a minute did Mrs. Lowe lose "control of
the convention.
Mrs. James Dow. president of the West
ern New Tork federation, effered an
amendment to the minority report of the
reorganization committee making pro
visions for State organizations that did
not wish to connect themselves with State
federations. As Mrs. Dow sat with the
Indiana contingent. It was thought to b<Â»
a plan to get the Indiana clubs Into the
federation without their having to join
their own State federation, connected wxth
which there has recently been gome
trouble. The motion met with disfavor
and was finally withdrawn. The debate
was finally closed by Mrs. Brock of Penn
sylvania, chairman of the reorganization
committee, who Is the champion of the
minority report, and. though she made a
most favorable Impression, the minority
report was lost in the vote, which was
linally called by States. 435 to SS.
Though the board of directors met thla
afternon the color question was not taken
from the table. The result creates a
growing belief that though the question
is bound to be settled it will be at the
discretion of the new board of director?.
The only new i^ature of the presidential
situation to-day wan the withdrawal of
Mrs. Williamson of New Jersey, which
left a clear field for Mrs. Lowe.
After the reorganization session. MrsÂ«.

WASHIXGTOX. June 7.â In mark
ed contrast with the exciting in
cident." attending the bitter
straggles of the closing hour? of
the session. Speaker Henderson
laid down his gavel at 5 o'clock this aft
ernoon at the conclusion of one of the
most picturesque scenes which has ever
occurred in the House of Representatives.
Party passion and pers&nal rancor, Â¦which
have bro-ght the House to the brink of
actual riot several times during the last
forty-^Ight hours, gave way In the clos
ing half hour to good fellowship which
found vent in a. patriotic outburst that
stirred the crowded galleries to the high
est pitrh of enthusiasm. During a brief
recess taken within thirty minutes of the
time fixed for the final adjournment to
?ive the President an opportunity to affix
his signature to the bills that were being
rushed to him for approval, a group of
members, led by MÂ»rcer of Nebraska, Bali
of Texas. Fitzgerald of Massachusetts and
Tavmey of Minnesota, congregated in the
area to the left cf the Speaker's rostrum
and began sir.gring. patriotic airs. Th*e gal
leries were tanked to the doors. "Co
lumfcta. Gem of the Ocean." "Auld Lang
Syne." 'The R*d. White and Blue," suc
cessively rar^-out. As the sfnging pro
ceeded members jctned the group until
without regard to age or party the en
tire membtrsiitp of ihe House joinwd In
the choruses. The spectators in the gal
lery applauded each song until the strains
cf "Dixie" filled the hali. Then their un
bounded enthusiasm broke out in wild
cheers. But the enthusiasm -"Dixie"
evoked was not to be campared Â¦with the
remarkable demonstration which fol
lowed when, in a clear, ringing tenor.
P.tzgeralJ of Massachusetts started the
national anthem with the Inspiring words.
â¢Â¦Through the dawn's early light." In
an instant ail the men. women ar.d chil
dren in the galleries w-re on their feet
joining in the singing. The mighty chorus
from-" thousands of throats reverberate-i
through the hail, making the pulses leap
and the blood tingle. It was a. magniti
cent and soul-inspiring spectacle. The la
dies kept time to the rhvthm of the music
with their handkerchiefs and the men
beat the measure with thetr hands. The
Speaker, pausing he entered the hall.
raised his voice also.
The excitement produced by the scene
overcame a white-haired old man In one
of the public galleries, and when the song
ceased he Jumped up on his seat and
shouted. "That is the son^- cf the angels
of heaven!"
He was plainly a crank, but as he
showed a disposition to harangue the
House he was cuickly ejected. After
Speaker Henderson had made a graceful
farewell speech, thanking the members
for their courtesy and had declared the
House adjourned the members testified
to his popularity by singing "For He's a
Jelly Oood Fellow." and the newspaper
correspondents in the press gallery ceie
brateij their emancipation frcm the bur
dens of Congress by singing the "Doxpl
ogv."
The principal feature of the closing day
in the House was the reversal of its ac
tion last night in turning down the con-
f Pre^s ori t v; e naval bill for yielding on the
item relating to ocean surveys. Over
night the sentiment of the House under
went a complete change and to-day the
members voted by a large majority to ac
cept outrigiK the Senate amendment,
which goes much further than the com
promise which the conferees offered last
night. The new conferees, led by Cannon,
who had brought In a compromise which
thev considered more satisfactory, were
ignominlously pushed aside. It wa^ a
distinct victory for -the oÂ«iy â
Fcis of Illinois, Dayton ot West Virginia
and Cummlngs of New York. The other
feature of the closing day was the course
cf Lentz of Ohio in blocking unanimous
consent legislation. For three days he
had oojected to bills because the majority
Â¦would not allow the testimony In the
Ooeta d'Alene investicatlcn to be printed
ar.d he maintained his position to the end.
When ell business had b^en deposed of
at 4:Â»J. when the Speaker attempted to call
the Houw to order, the members were
stia singing. With one accord they
turned upon him and drowned the crash
of hiÂ« gavel in the strains of "For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow." Wl'h this tribute
to the" Speaker's popularity, the group
broke up. As thev made their way to
their seÂ«ts the Speaker observed good
naturedly. "The chair will come to or
der."
Pame then anncunced that the Presi
dent'had nothing further to communicate.
The clerk rhen r^ad a longr list of bills
and resolutions signed by the President.
'ine House listened Impatiently to the
drcnir.sr voice of the cierk as he read the
list. The title ofthe last bill, "a bill for
ithe relief of Andrew Jackson," aroused
a roar of laughter.
As^the hands of the clock approached
the hour of 5 Speaker Henderson arose
and amid profound silence delivered
his valedictory In these words:
Gentlemen cf tfce H?u*<s of Representatives:

As the gavel fell ended the first
sÂ«?Â«ion of the Fifty-sixth Congress the
members cheered again and again.
As the spectators turned for the doors
the nc-trÂ«pa.p*>r correspondents in the presa
gallery arrested their progress with the
"Dcxology." They waited until it had
b^en sung and then departed. The Speak
er remained for ten minutes at the foot of
his rostrum shaking hands with thÂ« mem
bers, for all of whom he had a pleasant
word.

gress adjourned sine die at 5
o'clock this afternoon. For the
Senate tt was a day of waiting.
The naval appropriation billâ
the st-ambiing block, to final adjournment
âcould not re agreed to by the conferees
cf the two Hcrcses. and the disagreement
was reported to the Senate early in the
day. The report was accepted by the Sen-
Ate, wfalcli ref u*ed to request another con
ference, although Hale expressed the be
lief that an agreement might be reached.
There waÂ» an -evident disposition on the
part of thÂ« Senate to make trouble if the
cor.Â£ertNES should recede .from Senate
amendment as to the ocean surveys ar.i
it was deemed the wiser policy to afford
thÂ« House an opportunity to again pass
upon the Question.
At 3 o'clock, after severs.! recesses bmd
been taken, it became known to the Bea

Sweet Singers Delighted Hearers at
Odd Fellows' Hall Last
Evening.
The last concert of the twenty-third
season of the I/oring Club was given last
night at Odd Fellows' Hall. The club was
assisted by Miss Dorothy. GoodEell, so
prano; J. F. Veaco, tenor, and Miss Ruth
W. Loring, accompanist.- ; . vr . .
A number of new compositions were
rendered by this popular male chorus, in
cluding "Wondnotcs" of Franz Abt. "The
Slender Water Lily'.*: (Rubinstein), "Hunt
ing Song" (Abt), -"I I.ove But Thee"
(Storchi and "The Love-struck Herring"
(Schaffer), the last an especially popu
lar measure. The club is in excellent
form, their shading and expression mark
edly good, and only an occasional care
lessness of attackâ more especially at the
beginning of verses â offends a captious
critic.
Miss Goodsell'e solos, "With Newer
Strings" (Gounod), ''The Lotus Flower"
(Schumann) and Henschel's "Spring,"
with the encore "Berceuse" of Kruger,
gave much pleasure. J. P. Veaco sang
"Tho 1 You Forget" (Louis Campbell Til
ton), and was doubly encored, respond
ing with "Love Is a Bubble," (Frances
Allitsen) and "Dreams" (Bartlett). Mr.
Veaeo's smooth, sweet voice Is a distinct
acquisition in the thin ranks of local
tenors, and given a little more dramatic
power would be admirable for concert
work. A large and appreciative audience*
listened to the efforts of the performers.
LORING CLUB CONCERT
VERY SATISFACTORY
Monthly Exhibition of San Francisco
Athletic Club Productive of the
Usual Exciting Contests.
The San Francisco Athletic Club gym
nasium was packed to the doors last
night, the occasion being the regular
monthly boxing exhibition. There were
nine four-round bouts scheduled and, con
trary to the usual result, there was no
knockout. In two of the bouts the judges,
Harry Maynard and Kred Muller, were
unable to agree as to which boxer had
done the better work and an extra round
was ordered. They were still so evenly
matched that the bouts were declared
draws.
The bout between Frank Burns and
Charlo3 Aikens was stopped in the thjrd
round to save the latter from unneces
sary punlKhment.
In the bout between James Phipps and
Kd Feron. the latter Injured his foot in
the Xirst round and withdrew.
Alex Greggains filled his usual position
of referee and kept the boxers up to their
work. The results follow:
Ed KInnerty defeated D. Itlcger In four
rounds.
HtiKh Friel defeated Joe Murphy In four
rounds.
Al Jordan defeated Eddie - Schneider In four
round?.
Frank IJurns defeated Charles Aikens in three
rounds.
James Pblpps beat Ed Feron in one round.
Mark Hyan beat S. Rhodes in four rounds.
Fred Bell and Ed Tomalty, five rounds,' a
draw.
Jack Sheedon and William A. Foster, five
rounds, a draw.
Al Neill's friends are backing him to de
feat Jack Moffatt, the Chicago boxer, to
night as though the meeting at Wood
ward's Pavilion was all over but the
shouting. The Californian has ruled a 2
to 1 favorite almost from the time the
first ticket was written on the fight.
Moffatt has also developed a following,
and there are many bettors ready to take
a chance on him. The betting is expected
to liven up considerably to-day. In the
mutuels at Harry CorLett's last night the
betting was light, but there was sufficient
done to show the trend of opinion as to
the outcome of the fight. Xeill was in
strongest demand on the third line,
that which included tho rounds from
13 to 1". He was also played str.ongly to
win In from 7 to 12 rounds, and also If the
bout goes the limit. The mutuel board

The betting on the Irwin-Cole bout Is
also 2 to 1, Irwln being favorite, lie Is
looked upon as a coming man in his class,
having a straight left punch which stops
the strongest men. This bout is an at
tractive one, as some clever work Is ex
pected. "Jack" Welch will referee both
bouts, while pome lesser light will pass
upon the merits of George Curran and
Chick Flnnerty. The lirst brace of box
ers will enter the ring at 8:30 p. m.
The fighting in the ring to-night will
hardly be more spectacular than a strug
gle yesterday afternoon between a burly
Deputy Sheriff and Kruper, who had
charge of the preliminary sale of seats.
He established headquarters in a Market
street cigar stand and did a rushing busi
ness. The manager of Town Talk had a
$70 printing bill against the club. To se
cure this he attached the receipts derived
from the sale of seats. The Deputy Sher
iff appeared with his legal papers, but
Kruger would not give up the money In
his charge. A struggle ensued, which at
tracted a big- crowd. The power of the
law proved too strong to withstand, and
enough money was secured to pay the
claim. Manager Crowley affirms tho
printing bill was never presented.

be!ls. ar.d other vehicles were forced to a
standstill notwithstanding the Fhouts of
drivers. All eyes were raised toward thc
4
mAUKET street In the vicinity of,
the Oaas Sprcdkels tmildlns was
impassable yesterday morning.
Thousands of people blocked the
thoroTiphfaTe and the streets loading into
Jt_ Cars found a way through. the throng
only after the most inwssant clanging of
dome of the Claus Spreckels building and
to the plant fiapstaff above it, where, out
lined against the sky, was ,the figure of
a man made pipmy by the distance of 3G2
feet which separated him from the ex
cited crowd who watched him.
Exclamations of wonder and fear -cere
made by the crowd, but the man worked
on, as far as any eye could see, uncon
cernedly at his task, now and again stop
ping to look down on the crowd of- excited
people who watched him. Swung in a
painter's sling he was at the very top
of the flagstaff, gliding the great golden
ball which completes the staff. This ball
is three feet in diameter; it looked like,
a marble to those on the street below. The
wind was blowing almost a gale. The
ropes attached to the staff swung far out
from th^ir fastenings. The sling in which
the workman sat swayed ominously, but
the gilder appeared not to mind it.
It was a daring feat seldom witnessed
by those who watched it fearfully but
with a fascination they could not seem
ingly resist. The intrepid workman was
B. B. Jersey, who looked upon his start
ling performance as a matter of ordinary
moment. "Every man to his trade," he
said smilingly after he had descended
from his perilous perch. "When one
gets used to a thing he can do anything,
and climbing flagptaffs is one way of get
ting up in the world."

Phelan's election as . delegate at large

A brokerage in proxies has already be

to cleanse Chinatown is to be used in part
to employ special policemen in the Chi

convention was exchanged for the privi

the merchants fall to get any sanitary
satisfaction from their contributions to the
health fund they will be entertained,
nevertheless, by the production of new
features in local politics. Examples of
what may bo done for civil service under

be worth something.

permit investigation.
Politicians in the Democratic camp as

phases will be exploited in the State con

chuckling because Phelan was "gold

Charles A. Cassasa's vote was needed to
secure the Phelan indorsement in the

Cassava Is employed by the telephone
company â a corporation which comes to
the rescue whenever Phelan is in distress.
Kaufmann was unable to account for a
startling charge when he made his speech
to the convention night before last. The
next time he is overcome by surprise he
should ring up "Central" through the
Phelan "Private Exchange."
Charles \V. Fay of the Thirty-eiehth is
the Mayor's secretary. Democrats of
prominence assert that Fay has connived
at the degradation of civil service and
that through his connivance men have
been appointed to civil service positions
without having taken the examination

Dameron Estate Troubles.
AylettK. Cotton made a motion. to dis
miss the contest of the will of. the late
John D. Dameron yesterday on the
ground Â¦ that those heirs of the deceased
who appeared as contestants had not
given their consent to the filing of the
contest to Attorneys J. T. Riley and
Crittenden Thornton. Mr. Riley, who was
in court, forthwith charged Cotton with
improper conduct and produced his proofs
that those who appeared as contestants
on the record were I contestants in fact.
Judge Coffey without further argument
denied Cotton's motion. The petition ask
ing for the removal of John D. Dameron
as executor of the estate was not taken
up, but will be heard next week. .
Among the dead man's effects was found
a. certittcate Issued In 18SS by the State
Board of Pharmacy of Michigan to Carl
G. Printz. The hotel people knew noth
ing about him other than what appeared
on the register yesterday.
An inquest was held shortly after the
body arrived at the Morgue and a verdict
of suicide was rendered.
A sensational incident took place at the
Coroner's Â¦ office shortly after the Coro
ner's deputies arrived with the vial of
poison. Dr. Brugiere, the grandson of
Peter Sather, was in the office and took a
hearty .whiff -at -the vial. He immediately
fell to the floor, overcome by the fumes,
and there was a great commotion for "a
few moments, as the doctor lay on- the
carpet gasping for breath. AH the Â¦ win
dows were thrown open and after being
vigorously fanned the doctor recovered.
It was ascertained after the inquest that
Printz had been working as a drug clerk
In Hay wards â¢ for a month. He was dis
charged for drunkenness. I He had worked
for a -short: time -before that for Redlng
ton & Co. in this city. â¢Â¦-.-' . "
The body was taken to the Morgue and
an autopsy was held by Dr. Leland, who
found enough unabsorbed poison In the
stomach to kill six men.

GEORGE E. FLIINT, who for years
was the financial secretary of
Court Star of the Mission No. 7197
of the Ancient Order of Foresters,
was not present at his post on last
Wednesday night, and the announcement
was made that he was a defaulter. His
office was declared vacant.
Yesterday morning John "vVendt, chair
man of the board of trustees of the court,
applied for a warrant for Flint's arrest
on a charge of embezzlement. As the
chairman was unable to make known the
amount that the defaulting secretary was
short in his accounts a warrant was for
the time refused. In the meantime Flint
is under surveillance.
Flint had been financial secretary of the
court for about four years, and it wa3 iis
duty to receive the money from thft mem
bers and give them receipts for the j-arm.
This Included money paid for what i*
known in the order as assessments for the
endowment fund. So far as his momy
transactions in the court were concerned,
thev were correct, for at the close or
every meeting he had to turn over whit
he received to the treasurer. But whit
he did not turn in was money that he re
ceived outside of the court for dues and
assessments from members too busy to
attend meetings. Flint would put thÂ»
money into his pocket and sometimes
would give the paying brother credit for
a part of the amount paid and at other
times would not make any entry at all.
A special committee is collecting all the
due books from members for the purpose
of ascertaining their financial standing in
the court. When these shall ha\'e been
examined there m-iv be an Idea of the
amount involved. Film was formerly in
the saloon business on Stockton street.
It is said he played the races.

Passes Kesolutions Approving the
Course Pursued by Congress
man Kahn.
At a recent meeting of the . San Fran
clsco Cigar-makers' Union discussion was
held over the immigration of Japanese to
this country- It resulted in the passing or
the following resolutions:
Whereas, The laboring masses of California,
through the medium of mass meetings, resolu
tions, protests and other methods, have ex
pressed their opposition to Japanese Immigra
tion and have asked Congress to take action
with the object of totally excluding the Jap
anese from this country, as they are a men
ace to free white labor, and also to the wel
fare of all our citizens; and \
Whereas, In compliance with the unanimous
request of the working people of this State
for such action Congressman Julius Kahn of
San Francisco did immediately call the at
tention of Congress to the importance and
gravity of this question by the Introduction of
a bill In the House of Representatives with
the object of excluding further Japanese im
migration: therefore, be It â¢ -
Resolved, That the Cigar-Makers' Interna
tional Union No. 22S of San Francisco does here
by approve of the prompt action of Congressman
Kahn, In this matter, and does indorse his ef
forts to prevent the further immiisration of
the Japanese to our shores, and do respect
fully request the rest of the California and
Pacific Coast delegation to Congress to sup
port and assist him in the consummation of
this very necessary legislation. Be it further
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be forwarded to Congressman Kahn and also
be submitted to the public press for publica
tion. ->:?as-:

1 rUwninf HOURSâ 3 to SQ T the recent conference held at Montgomery,
j / \ Ala., by representative Southern men to con
! sider the various problems growing out of the
j relations between the white and the negro races much
{ was said of the duty of the dominant race to promote
; the welfare of the blacks and to fit them for the respon
! sibilities of freedom tnd citizenship. From the tenor
j of the discussion it was hoped no further efforts
would be made in any Southern State to deprive the
negro of the privilege of voting, but it is now evident
that the more liberal speakers at the conference arc
in advance^of their countrymen. The demand for
restricting negro suffrage continues. The people of
Virginia have resolved to revise their constitution
with the avowed object of depriving a large percent
age of negroes of the franchise, and in their eagerness
to accomplish the work some of them have called
upon the Governor to summon a special session of
the Legislature so that provision can be made for the
election of delegates to the constitutional convention
in November and thus get through with the work as
quickly as possible.
This new evidence of what appears to be a wide
spread determination throughout the South to climiÂ«
rate the negro from politics is not encouraging to the
hopes of those who put their trust in the liberal sen
timents uttered at the Montgomery conference. The
franchise in the hands of the ignorant is undoubtedly
bad, and if Virginia sought to impose some kind of
educational restriction upon white and black alike
there would be no objection. When, however, it is
proposed to so frame the restrictions as to make them
operative against men of a particular race and color,
there is hardly anything that can be said in favor of
them. The best way for the Southern States to fit
the negro for citizenship is to treat him with fairness,
for so long as he is treated unfairly he will be dis
contented and antagonistic to the whites, and there
fore less inclined to profit by their teaching.
There are other questions upon which the consti
tutional convention is expected to act, and upon
some of these" there is reason to believe that reform
is needed. The State is said to be overburdened with
office-holders, and it is the desire of the people to get
rid of a good many of them by abolishing the offices.
In that desire they will have abundant sympathy. It
is to be hoped that when the convention meets it will
be under the control of liberal men, and that if any
thing be done to deprive the negro of his vote it will
at least leave a way open for him to obtain it again
by education and thrift. There may be and doubtless
are evils in the suffrage as exercised by negroes in
their present condition of ignorance in the Southern
States, but their citizenship has been established in
the constitution of the United States, and none of
them should be deprived without cause of the right
to cast an honest vote and have it honestly counted.
Another blow, has been struck at women's rights,
?.nd the timid may expect to sec the angry hosts in
the field ready for battle. Congress is taking meas
ures to protect songbirds from destruction by those
who kill. the birds for their plumage. *

PERSONAL MENTION.
teacher appointed by the teachers them
selves. This idea must be ever borne in
mind: The schools are for the children,
not for the teachers. Therefore the teach
ers are not the ruling power, but those
who stand for the children's parents.
3. The third result which flows from the
general principle Is that the schools must
not be made the instrument of injustice
to any class of the people. Xot only must
they be open to all under the same con
ditions, but they must confer no privi
lege In the face of the State -which is
not enjoyed equally bv every other citi
zen. The children cf the people have a
right to an education in the public
schools, but they have a right to no more.
Least of all in the matter of public em
ployment should they have a claim to spe
cial treatment. The door to public em
ployment should be open to every citizen
on equal terms. Xo man should be pun
ished directly or indirectly for using his
legrai rights. If a parent in his discretion
educates his child in a system other than
the public school system that child should
suffer no disqualification for it9 parents
constitutional act. That child should
have as free access to public employment
as the child brought up in the common
school. Now employment in the public
schools is public employment. It stands
on precisely the same "tooting as employ
ment in the Postomce or in the City Hall.
Therefore to make graduation in the pub
lic school a necessary condition for teach
ing in the public school is to discriminate
against parental rights. As I have said
already, no parent will be willing to send
his child to a private institution if the
State reserves its emoluments for its own
warda.
In crder. therefore, to safeguard the
parents" rights and to adhere to the spirit
and letter of our constitution the schools
shculd belong to the people, should be
managed by the people and should be open
to all the children of the people whether
as pupils cr as teachers.
IL
It will be noticed that no objection to
these principles comes from the people.
Indeed, when an open attack is made upon
them, as in the charter of ISX. the people
g:ve a very decided answer. Neither does
the attack come from the great body of
hard working and zeaious teachers. They
realize their position with r-gard to the
parents of the children. A great trust
has beeÂ» given them and a grtat respon
sibility. Ihey believe they can fulfill that
trust better Dy frankly accepting the re
sponsibility. The best teacners are the
most anxious to see the parents interested
in the schools.*
The attack comes from another quar
ter and it comes all along the line. TnosÂ«
who make it claim that tne people are not
fit to manage the schools, that the schools
should be in the hands of the teachers and
that the teachers should be products of
the schools. There is a natural tendency
in man to magnifv his office. It is easy
to convince him that his profession is the
most important in the scheme of things.
Where he and his professional brethren
are numerous and influential it is not dif
ficult to persuade them that they know
better than mere outsiders what makes
for the common weal. Teachers do not
escape this tendency to form themselves
into a separate estate. The majority, it is
true, recognize their true position as pub
lic servants and are satisfied when they
receive security of tenure. There are
others, however, who consider that the
profession of teaching puts them on a
different level from all other public em
ployes. I>ealing so much with children
they convince themselves that the com
munity has never emerged from thft
shadow of the pedagogue's rod. There
fore the communit3- is unfit to manage the
schools. That management should be de
livered into the hands of "educators."
which is another way for saying teacher
politicians. These "educators" are evolved
In some mysterious way from the or
dinary teacher, but they are as superior
to the ordinary teacher as is the butterfly
to the grub. In fact, one of their chief
demands is that the ordinary teachers
should relinquish security of tenure in
their favor. They demand the divine right
to set up and to pull down, to give life or
destroy.
This blessed scheme is known to the
elect as "riddine the schools of politics."
The school system is to be a self
contained entity, as independent of the
people as a business enterprise. To be
sure the dear people -will have the privi
lege of paying for the support or the
system, but the management of It must
be In the hands of those entirely free
from popular influence.
In a late address Mr. Frederic Burk,
principal of the San Francisco Xorrnal
School, formulates this policy. He said
that no matter how iniquitous legislators
are on other matters, they are always
willing to listen and to be guided in school
legislation by those who make a profes
sion of teaching and are therefore able
to speak from experience, and that ' he
would recommend the appointment of a
committee to wait upon the next Legis
lature and suggest the method to be em
ployed in ridding the schools of politics.
He even went so far as to name the com
mittee, viz.. President Wheeler of the
State University. President Jordan of the
Private University at Palo Alto. Princi
pal Black of the San Diego Normal School
and Superintendent Kirk.
Concerning this cold-blooded proposi
tion it may be well to remark that there
is no department of the Government
which can be or should be taken out of
politics. Give politics any meaning you
please, good or bad. and in the last re
sort it signifies popular control. To take
the schools out of politics therefore
means to take them away from popular
control.
It is against the fundamental principles
of our Government to remove anything in
civics from the sphere of the people's
will. It is all very well to say that poli
tics is corrupt, that bosses rule, that
schools are Injured. If politics Is corrupt
it is because the people are corrupt, if
bosses rule it is because the people vote
for them, if schools are injured it is the
will of the sovereign multitude. No com
munity deserves to have a government
better than itself. Even were we to be
lieve all the hysterical asseverations of
the goo-goos we can only conclude that as
the people can have what they want they
are getting tho kind of politics they like.
A government of the people and by the
people and for the people cannot be higher
or better or purer than the people. To a
government of that kind we are commit
ted, and as we enjoy its advantages we
must bear its drawbacks. This is the rea
son all our reform machines go to smash.
Honesty is not in the law nor in the char
ter, but in the man who executes it. 1
should not like to trust a thief with the
administration of the ten commandments.
For this reason there is no guarantee
whatsoever that the schools would fare a
whit better in the hands of the "educa
tors" than they fare In the hands of the
common folk. It is to be proved that to
take them out of one kind of polities win
not land them in another kind of politics.
Who is so simple as to believe that the
"educators" are any wiser or better or
purer than the population In general?
How did they get their positions If not by
the same arts* that every other politician
got his? They can pull wires, they can
concoct schemes, they can put deals
through with a readiness and dispatch
that would put the most experienced ward
heeler to the blush. Why "then do they
demand special and exceptional treat
ment? What should we irdnk of the
sewer cleanersâ that latest and most mar
velous development of the civil serviceâ
if they approached the Legislature with
the proposition to take the sewers out of
politics by giving the Beard of Works into
their hands? What should we think of
the postofflce clerks if they demanded that
the whole management of the mall service
should, be committed to elected- repreÂ«ent
allv ?r J rom tnelr body? The demand
would bo no more ridiculous than the pro
posal of certain tearher. politicians that
only pedagogues ;_ should control the
schools. â¢
III.
I have set forth in detail the general
principles which underlie our school sys
tem because the present School Board of
San Francisco violates every one of them
That body is a shining example of the
beauties of taking the schools out of poli
t L C! S J I l any School Board In the State
should be representative of the people it
should be the School Board of San Fran
cisco. The general average of popular In
telligence Is higher here than In any other
section of the community, and if the peo
ple of this city are not able to manage
their own schools, then popular schools
are a failure. Yet by the act of the pres*
ent.administration.the schools are taken
out. of the hands of the people and put
into the hands of the teacher politicians.
Of the four members of the School Board
three represent the School Department
v and one. represents nothing and nobody.
THE TRIUMPH OF THE FIRE DRILL
AT the burning of the Lafayette Primary School
on Thursday there was given an exhibition of
the supreme value of the fire drill in which the
children of the public schools are trained. At the
tine the are broke cut there in the building
; : nearly 500 children, almost all of them under twelve
years of a.ge, and the dar.ger of a frightful tragedy
â¢was imminent. Fortunately the children had beea
â¢ thoroughly drilled for the emergency, and the prin
cipal of the school, Mi^s Kate Casey, was thoroughly
fitted to deal vith it. Without betraying the slightest
ahrrn she gave the signal calling for the drill, and so
promptly was it obeyed that within. two minutes after
the alarm sounded every one of the children was out
ci the bulldiug and beyond danger.
. When a catastrophe is avoided few peop'e give heed
to the foresight Â«rhich guarded against it. It is .1
. familiar theme with historians that wise statesmen
v.ho prevent wars never receive half the glorv
awarded to those who by some :orm 01 lolly permit
wars to come and then make splendid efforts to
grapple with them. The truth applies to the credit
p:viri to individuals in private life as well as to the
leaders of r.atior.?. Had the teachers of the Lafayette
School piven their prpils no training in the fire drill,
zvA had the outbreak of the fire precipitated some
thing like a panic, ar.d had the teachers then displayed
courage and devotion in rescuing the imperiled chil
dren, the highest praise would have been awarded to
their actions. As it is the general public is apt to
overlook the merit of what was done and pass it by
. without drawing the right lesson from it and giving
honor where it is due.
Under any and all circumstances -an ounce of pre
vention \> better then a pound of cure, and the majdm
is- especially tr::e where the evil to be prevented is
that of a panic ru?h from a building on fire. Over
Â£i:d over again instances h2ve occurred where a
frightful lo?s of life has resulted solely from a lack of
a Â¦ T~- 'Â« Â« - .
such prevention. Fires have occurred m theaters ai::l
other jjnhV.c halls where the exits were so numerous
and so ample that the whole audience could be dis
. ... , . ...
m-.sscd within five minutes, and yet panic-stncken
people have trampled upon one another, blockaded
the doorways ar.d perished by scores. Such is the
danger that confronts the children of our public
schools, should the- appearance of fire in one of
these wooden structures crowded with pupils be fol
lowed by a rush of terror-stricken children the 'in
cvitablc resuit would be a calamity appalling in its na
ture and extent. We have thus good reason to cpm
mend the prudence of the school authorities in pro
viding by the fire drill a thorough prevention against
such a result. It is clearly cne of the most important
parts of school discipline.-
By that, drill and by the coolness and courage of
the principal of the school San Francisco has been
saved from a calamity which might have filled hun
dreds of homes with mourning. The lesson- should
rot be lost upon any portion of the community. An
other illustration has been given of the excellent work
which the school teachers are doing in the training
of the children under their charge, and it yt one for
whose pood results thousands of our people have

As a consequence the board i3 playing
into the hands of those who would maks
the State system a close preserve. It will
not trust itself to select teachers, though
this is one of the duties for which the
members draw their generous salaries. It
appeals to outsiders to draw up a schema
and the observant reader may with profit
compare the list of these outsiders with
Mr. Burk's committee, which is to influ
ence the next Legislature. Why. we may
inquire. wa3 Dr. Jordan's name put on
that list? He Is the president of a pri
vate institution. Why should he be sin
gled out and the president of St. Mary'*
College passed over? What has Alameda
County to do with the school system of
San Francisco? What right has Presi
dent Wheeler to forget his duty of hands
off even if our School Board is too incom
petent to know that duty? The schema

was indecent in those who accepted it.
Every one sees now that thi3 new plaa
is part and parcel of the great deception.
It is true that neither Dr. Wheeler nor
Dr. Jordan was privy to the Imposture,
but for years the idea has been fostered
that Berkeley and Stanford were the cap
and crown of our public school system,
and that to them the system should loo 3c
for its models, its governors and its teach
ers. Hence came the selection of a com
mittee, all the members of which belong
to one style of educationalists. No doubt
the plan they will put forward, if they
ever put it forward now, will make it im
possible for any one but their own dis
ciples to gain preferment.
With such a- plan in operation thÂ»
schools would be well guaranteed against
all outsiders. That the idea of such a
quarantine emanated solely from the
School Board does not appear likelyâ
though I must not be taken as supposing
that august body sterile of all ideas. The
order would seem to come from higher
quarters. For what other reason can w*
assign for the action of that other fearful
and wonderful contrivance â the Civil Ser
vice Commission? Its application forms
demand from the candidate information
as to the school in which he was educated.
That is none of the examiner's business.

THE charter which was submitted to
the citizens of San Francisco In 1S9S
Â¦was rejected because of its pro
visions against freedom of education.
At the request of 'certain teacher pol
iticians th3 Freeholders had inserted a
clause limiting the choice of teachers to
graduates of the public school system of
California. Against such an attempt to
create an educational monopoly public
sentiment revolted. The charter was de
feated. The people of this city were not
willing then and are not willing now to
surrender their right to select teachers
wherever and however they can secure
the best.
But it would be a mistake to suppose
that those teacher politicians lost courage
or hope. They know so much better than
the people what is good for the people's
children. The one thing necessary to se
cure the educational salvation of Cali
fornia is to give them full and everlasting
control of the school system. With life
positions, good salaries and unlimited
patronage there is no knowing how high
they might elevate the community.
Of course they begin with San Fran
cisco. Let no one dare to insinuate that
thi3 interest in San Francisco is dictated
by the magnitude of San Francisco's
school system and the length of San Fran
cisco's purse. That interest is purely pa
triotic and -pedagogical. An enterprising
doctor loves nothing so much as a rich
patient with notions about diseases. Sci
ence is benefited by experiment, and the
patient who has the means to pay for ex
periments and the belief that he needs
them and the devotion to submit to them
is a godsend to a poor but scientific prac
titioner. San Francisco is strong enough
to support aad rich enough to tempt all
the resources of science. The city has
been doctored by every school of political
medicine._ We have had government by
mobs, government by corporations, gov
ernment by reformers, government by
bosses, and we are now trying govern,
ment by salaries. That this last form of
municipal management finds favor in the
eyes of the teacher politician is merely a
coincidence. His thoughts are of higher
things. With mental vision he sweeps
oTfli t m 'f mountal n Peaks, and though
the filthy lucre may cling to his hands as
he progresses through this vale of tears
and politics he esteems it but as dross in
comparison with the benefits his talents,

? JÂ« n w e^ 1Ing l wlth P u bHc questions such as
this it is always necessary to keep close
'Â«Â« rst . principles It is true one rUns the
risk of being tedious, but it Is better to
be tedious than obscure and illogical.
Prejudice an.i passion and self-interest
are ever tending to hide the issues in such
matters. In them a short-sighted view is
always a mistaken view. Without fre
quent reference to the great truths on
which our civil polity is founded there is
continual danger of stumbling into blund
ers, which are worse than crimes.
There is no right more sacred than that
of the parent to his child. As.lonp as
father and mother do their duty no power
on earth is justified in interfering with
them. The state can intervene only when
that duty is manifestly neglected, and
then only by due process of law. In an
ordinary family there is nothing the par- \
ents resent so much as the meddling of
outsiders with their children. If you wish
to lose a man's friendship forever tell
him how to manage his family. No father.
no mother .will suffer other people and
other people's ideas to rule the home.
Now in the eyes of thp parent the state
is merely the other people of the commu
nity. He will itcognize their right to in
sist on education because education is a
public necessity, but he reserves to him
self the choice of teachers, of schools, of
methods and of the kind of education that
will best advance the interests of his
child. When parents associate themselves
in school districts in order to support a.
system of common schools they do not
surrender these rights. They keep the
management of the schools in the hands
of their representatives; and they keep in
their own hands the right to send their
children to these Reneral schools or to use
other schools. If to use them should com
mend itself to their judgment.
From this principle three great results
flow :
1. The schools belong to the people
whose children use them. I do not mean,
of course, that the schools exist only for
those who have children actually attend
ing them, but I mean the people of the
territory whose wants the schools are
built to supply. Hence it is that In our
system of government the school district
is the smallest political unit enjoying
home rule. It is nearest to the people. In
a large city where the system is naturally
complex the truth of this conclusion is
not evident at once. But let us take a
country district with a few dozen fami
lies. They have built their school and
now comes the question who Is to manage
It? Surely they do not hand It over to
th*Â» authorities of a county a hundred
miles away. They elect representatives
or trusteesâ they elect them directly and
they elect them for a short torm. These
trustees stand in the place of the people
of that district, not in the place of the
people of any other district. They man
age the school? for the children of the
locality and according to the local needs.
This independence of the school district
is guaranteed by the constitution even
against all the people of the State. Xot
i even our Legislature can pass a special
enactment "providing for the manage
' ment of common schools." General laws
j there must be, but as long as those cen#
! eral laws are obeyed each school unit is
self-contained and independent.
What is true of the country school dis
trict is true of San Francisco. The city
i schools belong to the city people. They
! do not belong to the people of 'Alarneda.
Santa Clara or Sacramento. We dp not
meddle with the schools of any 'other
county. Why should the people of any
other county meddle with ours? Such
meddling, no matter by whom, is posi
tively indecent and the man or board that
suggests it Is untrue to the interests of
the- city and a traitor to the people's
rights.
2. The second result which flows from
the general principle Is that the schools
are built for the children, not for the
teachers. In a country district, who hires
the teacher? Shall the representatives of
the peoole accept a teacher sent, say bv
the Federal Government at Washington
or by the State Government at Sacra
inento? Hardly. No dnubt the Federal
Government and the State ' Government
might.be able to secure far more efficient
teachers than the trustees In their wis
dom-may appoint, bufthere is something
more than efficiency to be considered.
School learning Is not the .wjinle of life.
There are franchises-more valuable than
the arts of reading and writing. I do
not believe there is any school district in
California that would sell the risrhts of
parents for any- hall-mark from State or
nation. Airain. the constitution considers
those rights so precious that it guaran
tees thpmJn.its provisions. It expressly
limits the power of centralization by se
curing to each county, the power of licens
ing teachers. -As long as that power is
exerc'sed. and the constitution Intended
that It should be exercised, the cower of
the people to choose teachers for their
children cannot bo monopolized by any
central authority. .
Now what the constitution will not
grant to the whole State It surely will
not grant to any class or caste within
the State. When the Trustees of a school
district would be unwllling'to accept a
teachpr appointed by. th*. central execu
tive they certainly wilÂ» not accent a

rROM the temper displayed at the meeting of
the Republican County Committee on Thursday
evening it is evident there are dangers ahead for
the party in this city. Two plans were submitted for
the organization of district clubs, and at once dissen
sions arose. After a wrangle lasting nearly four hours
the committee was unable to reach a decision on the
subject, and both plans were referred to a joint com
mittee consisting of the executive and advisory com
mittees, with power to act. Upon that committee,
j therefore, devolves the duty of arranging a plan which
[ v. ill defeat any schemes the bosses may have to obtain
I control of the party machinery and which will se
| cure every loyal Republican in his right to a fair and
\ equal voice in the organization of the clubs.
The dissensions in the committee may be minor
I matters in themselves, but they serve to point once
more the warning The Call has so often repeated.
When the Republican majority in the Legislature en
tered upon the task of electing a United States
Senator to succeed Senator White it was made
evident that certain bosses, backed by th;
Southern Pacific Railroad, had devised a scheme
for obtaining the position for one of their own
number. The better element of the party suc
ceeded in baffling that scheme at the regular session
and defeating it altogether when the extra session was'
called. The bosses, enraged by the disappointment,
retired from the field uttering threats against those
who had overthrown them. Those threats they carried
cut partially at the State convention, and now, flushed
by that success, they r.re more vigorous than ever in
their efforts to regain control of the party machinery,
and more bitter in their determination to exclude de
cent Republicans from any share in the control of
rcrtv affairs.
* " . , , ...
Tnere is but one way to assure Republican success
in California in the corning campaign, and that is by
depriving the bosses and the would-be bosses of all
their evil poser. There is but one way to accomplish
the overthrow of boss dictation, and that is by the
united action of good men. It behooves all honest.
loyal and patriotic Republicans to assert their rights
:r> the party councils at this time and to perform their
full share of all campaign duties. The bosses are not
fools. If they see that the better element of the party
is aroused and intends to take control they will not
f:ght; but if they observe any indifference or careless
ness on the part o! that element, they will at once
bend even- energy and employ every resource of their
crnnir.g and their corruption to profit by it and put
their own tools in power.
Even- advantage of the political situation is in the
hands of true Republicans. President McKinley is'
personally one of the most popular men that ever
presided over the republic; his administration has
been excellent; prosperity prevails throughout the
country and is secured by Republican legislation; the
defeat of the bosses by the election of Senator Bard
gives to the party a high prestige in the State as in j
the nation. Everything, therefore, promises victory,
but the promise is based upon the provision that lion- j
est Republicans do their duty. It is not a yellow dog
year. Had the Southern Pacific Railroad's
candidate been elected to the Senate it is doubt- !
ml if, with all the advantages of the time, the
most earnest efforts could have saved California to the
Republican column. That danger is past, but another
remains. Any appearance of boss domination in the
party councils, any suppression of the rank and file
of the party, any unfit nomination for office made by
cictat'ion of the bosses, will seriously compromise the
campaign and weaken the chances of victory.
The moral of the situation is plain. Republican suc
cess in this city and in this State is dependent upon
the vigcr and resolution of that element of the party
which defeated the bosses in the Senatorial fight. The
men who stand for honest politics and true Repub
licanism must come forth and take part in the contest
from the first. This is no time for shirking any por
tion of, the political responsibilities and duties of a
citizen. There is a danger ahead of the party which
none can deny, but it is a danger which can be easily
overcome if the loyal members of the party will be
watchful, resolute and vigorous.
THE IMMIGRATION OF J0F>ANESE
SINCE The Call first directed attention .to the
menace of Japanese immigration there has
been ample evidence that the warning was ut-,
tcred not a daj* too soon. In fact, every development
of the issue from th.it time to this has confirmed the
statement that the problem is one of growing im
j portance arfd that the governmental authorities at
Washinarton should act promptly in dealing with it.
It was announced Wednesday that Statistician Eccle
ston of the local Bureau of Immigration reports 1068
arrivals of alien immigrants at this port during the
month of May. Of these 380 were tourists and 6S8
will remain in California. The nationalities repre
j rented werei^Japanese, 437; English. 88; Korean, 19;
{Mexican, 24: Portuguese, \28; Scandinavians, ir, and
I Spanish-American, 11. The occupations were: Farm
laborers. 252: mariners, 44: skilled laborers, 25; com
mon laborers, 34; miners, 16: farmers, 10; merchants,
37; r.o occupation, including women and children,
It will be seen from the figures that the Japanese
far exceed in numbers the people of any other na
j tionality who are nor; arriving at this port. It is to
i be borne in mind, moreover, that the 437 who have
entered this city direct do not by any means include
ill the Japanese who came into the State last month.
It is safe to say a considerable number found their
way across the northern border, and that the total
immigration is much larger than it appears.
In this connection it is worth noting that recent
j reports from Hawaii are to the effect that the Japan
j ese in the islands "have been misbehaving themselves
considerably of late on several of the plantations, and
it is very evident they have disaffected leaders behind
them." If the reported discontent grow to serious
proportions it is quite likely there may be something
like a wholesale exodus of Japanese from Hawaii, and
in such case they will almost certainly seek to better
their condition by coming to California. We shall
thus have a notable increase to the immigration
which comes direct from Japan, and the effect upon
the local lah>*r market will be highly injurious. <
The danger of this immigration has been pointed
cut to the administration and to Congress by the
Senators and Representatives from California, and we
may reasonably expect that steps will be taken to pre
vent it in the near future. In the meantime it will
be well tor the people of the Pacific Coast to keep up
the agitation for Japanese as well as Chinese restric
tion. *The one sort of immigration is as bad as the
other, or if there be my difference it is to the advan
tage of the Chinese. The United States must be
guarded against wholesale immigration of any kind
of oriental tabor.
If local Democrats have failed to break the "slate"
in their highly interesting convention they have ?.t
least the satisfaction, so dear to the Democratic heart,
of having broken seveial heads.
/""* ONGRESS is closing the session with a bang
I in both houses. The discussions of the week
have been marked by efforts on the part of the
more reckless leaders of the Bryanite factions to for
mulate something like material for the campaign.
Thus there has been on their side more wrangling
than debate, more rhetoric than reason, and on the
part of certain demagogues frequent outbursts of-pas
sion and folly less like the arguments of sane men
than the ravings of lunatics.
Senator Hanna has long been the particular object
of the malignity of the yellow journals, and borrowing
the weapons of those irresponsible bushwhackers of
politics several of the loose-tongued advocates of
Bryanism have on more than one occasion made use
of them in the Senate itself. These attacks, though
| contemptible in their nature, have been irritating, and
I at last Senator Hanna has lost patience and turned
i upon his malicious foes." He has dealt with them
! ence and for all so far as present issues are concerned,
| and after his short speech of Tuesday it is not likely
: that any one will attempt again in the Senate to at
tack him when he is aroused from his usual con
temptuous indifference- to such enemies and is ready
Pettigrew of South Dakota, in the course of his
bJatherskiting against the Republican party and its
leaders, stated that Cramp, the Philadelphia ship
builder, contributed $400,000 to the Republican cam
paign fund in 1893 with the understanding that he
would be reimbursed by contracts. .for the construc
tion of warships for the Government. It was a silly
statement, and no one on the Republican side paid
any attention to it. Thereupon Bacon of Georgia,
with solemn pompousness, as if he were dealing with
a grave subject, proceeded to repeat the charge and to
say it had been denied neither by Senator Hanna,
present chairman of the Republican National Com
mittee, nor by Senator Carter, who was chairman in
1892. Then the storm broke.
There are some libelers who are not much more im
portant than gnats, but, as Queen Guinevere remarked
of them, "they sting." The Senator from Ohio had
been stung once too often. The moment Bacon ut
tered the charge Hanna replied: "If I should under
take to reply to all such statements made on this floor
I would occupy more of the time of the Senate than
even the Senator from Georgia does. I heard the
statement and considered it unworthy of notice, and
I declined to dignify it by a denial. I had nothing to
do with the campaign of 1892, but I have heard this
story and I say most emphatically and decidedly that
I believe it is not true. So far as such allusions are
n:ade to the campaign of 1806, I desire to say that no
promises were made ?.nd no considerations were of
fered to any person or any corporation for contribu
tions made." He then reviewed the general course
of Pettigrew in debate and closed by saying he some
times doubted the sanity of the man in putting such
things into the Congressional Record and expecting
people to believe them.
Carter confirmed the statement of the Ohio Sena
tor, and added: "I say now that any charge that con
tributions were received to be reimbursed through
the medium of Government contracts, or that any
promises were made to corporations or to individuals,
U absolutely false and can be branded properly only as
a lie."
Of course it is not pleasant to say of a United
States Senator that he talks as if he were not sane T
snd that his language ought to be branded as lying,
but when a Senator persists in talking in that way
what else can be said of him? Senator Hanna acted
quite properly in crushing the pestiferous insect with
one blow. Why make two kicks at a Pettigrew, or
be indirect in dealing with his pettigrewing?

The protest continues:

"'human documents." On* sees at once
on examining these documents the new
prevalence of things. The whole mate

into view. It has been said of Balzac
that he first gave us novels in which peo-

as Hugo's sometimes are. They are not
the invincible conquerors of circumstance
that Dumas loves. They do not live by

the heroes and heroines of George Sand

Of the four names, lingo. Duma*. Sand

If Victor Hugo comes first on the list of
novelists it is not so much by reason of
the fame of "Les Miserable*." which is
perhaps for the mass of English readers
his only novel, but because he was the
great literary genius of his time, the first
man of letters of his century. The novel
was far from being his main Interest. One
sign of thi3. among many others, is found
In a peculiar feature of his career as a
novelist â it is made up of two periods,
separated by the interval of a whole gen
eration. From "Notre Damp de l J aris"
(I>i31) to "Les Miserablrs" Â«iyo no part cf
his incessant activity was given to the
novel, though it was in these years that it
was celebrating its great triumphs and
assuming a new and more serious import
ance, especially through the work of Bal
zac. And when he came back to the novel
in "Les Miserables" there was little to
show that these changes had had any
effect on him. "Les lilserables" and the
novels that followed It are plainly from
the same mind as "Notre Dame." and
were built upon the same plan. In them
all he is essentially a poet. Tholr quali
ties are poetic qualitiesâ amplitude and
grandeur of conception, imaginative
power. In "Notre Dame" ho is a poet of

the charm of the historical interest, in tha
exuberance of youth: in "Les MIserables**
he is a poet of GO. looking back on years
of political and social agitation and un
rest, confronting from exile the somber
perplexities of his time and reflecting on
the past and present of hum^n affairs anl
institutions. Each novel has for theme
some large and Imposing phase of our
human lot. And the mature poet becomes
also a philosopher. The novels -wore to be
philosophic interpretations of history and
life in certain great and universal phases.
But what the reader remembers of these
novels is not the philosophic theme, but
the poetry of the details.' the wealth of
ideas, the vividness of description, the
intensity of the situations, which, espe
cially in the later works, constantly tend
to descend to the melodramatic, the daz
zling magic of the language, and more
than all. perhaps, the deep and ardent
human sympathy that is all-pervasive in
them, the indomitable faith in humanity
that irradiates them.
No writers could well be more unlike
than these four masters of the novel, nor
could four well be chosen anywhere whn.Â«<>
works wonld present a greater variety of
qualities and interest. They w>ll exhibit
the wide range of the novel as a literary
form and its capacity for the most diverse
effects.
This does not mean that these four have
been in all respects unsurpassed. It la
quite likely that many would name- on
their list 6f the greatest French novels

quite certain that these have not been the
most important novelist?, if we are think

not one of them that is not represented

nieritâ it Is clear that the age has been
as conspicuous for the great mass as for
the quality of whnt it has produced. But
in spite again of the conflicting claims, of
schools it may be jnalntained that among
all these considerable novelists there are
four who in a special way dominate the
fieldâ Hujso, Dumas, George Sand and
Balzac.

Secretary Long's Experiment With
the Indiana and Massachu
setts Has Proved to Be
a Marked Success.
WASHINGTON, June 7.â The experi
ment with the battleships Indiana and
Massachusetts has been a marked suc
cess. A telegram received at the Navy
Department to-day from Admiral Silaa
Casey, commandant of the League Island
Navy-yard, annoiinced that the two big
ships were completely equipped and ready
for sea. He Said the Indiana would pull
out at noon and the Massachusetts about
two hours later for Newport, via Hamp
ton Roads. The delay in the case of the
latter ship â¢was not because of any lack of
preparedness on her part, but simply be
cause the tide would not serve until this
this afternoon. Thus it appears that these
two formidable vessels have been ready
fcr any required service in the short
space of about forty hours, without the
slightest warning or notice to the com
mandant of the League Island navy-yard
or-the commanders of the two battleships.
The result is regarded as a satisfactory
vindication of the policy of keeping ships
"in ordinary," recently adopted by the
Navy Department. The record made at
League Island is about as good as any
abroad, with superior facilities in the lat
ter case. This little experiment will be
noted with interest by other naval power?
A later telegTam from Rear Admiral
Casey at League Island announced that
both battleships, the Indiana and the
Massachusetts, were lying in the stream
with steam up and would start down the
Delaware River at 5 o'clock. Everything
was ready and everybody aboard except
three marine officers, who will join the
Shins at Hampton Roads.

QUICK ANSWER
TO EMERGENCY
CALL OF NAVY
Interest in the Cape Nome mines h;
been quickened by reports of most im
portant strikes made all over the northern
mineral belt during the past winter. Mail
advices dated March IS, received by the
J. S. Kimball Company yesterday, contain
stories of gold mining that seem too ex
travagant to be true and yet, as they
come from the confidential agents of the
company, they are accepted here with lit
tle question.
The most important find reported is that
of a quartz ledge running through Nome
Hill, on the headland known geographi
cally as Cape Nome, which assays $750 to
the ton. J. S. Kiraball and his associates
learned during the \s inter that the hill
was rich and they had a number of
claims staked out there. The re*ult of the
winter's prospecting and assay work, how
ever, comes as a staggering surprise. J.
\V. Blundon^ Kimball's conttdential agent,
writes that Nome Hi:i is practically a
solid mass of rich gold-bearing quartz.
The hill is about 400 feet in height and
extends about one and a half miles into
the sea.
Another strike of almost equal richness
has been made about six miles east of
Port Clarence. The rock there assays
very high. Blundon writes that the foot
hills about twenty miles back from the
beach seem to be full of mineral crop
pings. He predicts that when the summer
opens the placer mines will be deserted
and there will be a stampede for the
mountains.
Because of the prospects made during
the winter excitement ran high at Nome.
The people seemed to be paralyzed by
the enormous richness of the country.
Blundon says only prospect work will be
done during the Â«omlng year, but he pre
dicts that during the two years following
over $100,000,000 in gold will be taken from
Nome and vicinity.
"The winter at Xome," writes Blundon,
"has been mild and pleasant. I have suf
fered less from cold than I did in Mon
tana or even Benicia one winter. The
thermometer has never been lower than
40 degrees below zero. During. the past
forty days we have had a warm sun shin
ing."
The most Important document received
by Kimball & Co. was the report of S. J.
Marsh, a mining-engineer employed by
them during the winter In assaying
quartz from prospects all along the crop
ping ledges. His examination was mainly
along the coast line and extended to Nor
ton Sound, to Slnrock River and some dis
tance back on the different creeks.
The ledffes examined, he says, varied
from a few feet to 100 feet in width, the
richer generally being the smaller and
In some instances they showed croppings
for a distance "of several thousand feet.
No development work has yet been done
to prove the depth of the ore. but from
the nature of the deposit the engineer
thinks it fair to assume that thtf depth
is considerable. Some silver appears al
loyed with the gold, but generally in small
amounts and not of importance.
Marsh thinks it is difficult to predict
any detailed process by which these ores
can be successfully treated, but says that
the character so far as determined would
indicate a milling ore.
The present winter has . demonstrated
that some of the creeks' run all winter
and the larger streams afford many good
millsites.' With harbor accommodations
for the landing of fuel and a railroad line
along the coast the engineer believes that
a mill can be operated the year round.
The general topography of the country
is such that the construction of roads or
tramways is easy. Jlining timber and fuel
are lacking and would have to be im
ported.

The members of the Wild Goose Min
ing and Trading Company that went
north on the steamer Charles D. Lane
have had a hard time of It lately, accord
ing to stories brought from Seattle by
some of the passengers and crew who left
the vessel en the Sound. The Lane is
now on her way to Nome and from all
accounts the trouble will break out again
as soon as the gold fields are reached.
The Charles D. Lane was formerly the
Irrawaddy and was purchased in the East
by Charles D. Lane for the Nome trade.
On the way here a rivet dropped out of
her bow and the vessel was half full of
water before the 'leak was discovered.
She put Into Montevideo and was over
hauled, after which she reached San
Francisco in due course.
On the arrival of the Irrawaddy in this
port her new owners ordered the ma
chinery and hull put In first-class order.
About $17,000 worth o* work was done on
tne machinery and about $30Ci> expended
on the hull. These bills have not been
paid, but as the Hobart estate is inter
ested with Lane in the Wild Goose Min
ing and Trading Company it will probably
meet the indebtedness. A meeting of the
Hobart heirs was heid yesterday, at
which the matter was discussed and a
settlement partially agreed upon.
\\ hen the Charles D. I.ane got away
ror beattie tne trouble aboard the ship
began. A heavy northwester was blow
ing and when the vessel ran Into it many
of the passengers got scared. There is
not a doubt but what the steamer is per
fectly seaworthy, but the passengers and
some of the crew did not think so. and
in consequence they left the vessel wnen
she reached Seattle. A number of the
passenger? demanded their money back
and got it: others sold their tickets to
men more anxious than they to reach the
gold fields. One-half the waiters in the
steward's department walked ashore and
the second mate quit. J. J. Haviside, the
rigger, was going to Nome to put up land
ing machinery by which the cargo on the
Lane and other Vessels owned by the con
cern could be quickly and expedltlously
landed. Mr. ; Haviside was accompanied
by his wife and daughter and a gang of
riggers. They all left the ship at Seattle
and .ire now on their way back to San
Francisco.
According to those of the passengers
who came home on the tJmatilla every
thing v.as at sixes and sevens on the
Lanei and furthermore, they assert the
vess/l was top-heavy. She took on a
deckload of lumber at Seattle which they
say made her cranky. At Nome again
Mr. Lane is likely to find everything at
sixes and sevens. Many of his claims
have been "jumped."

The scarcity of sailors is proving to be
a great hardship to the erain fleet. Ves

awaiting crews. '"Blood money" is again
being paid, but it Is rarely the sailor sees
a cent of it.
After lyir.g in the stream three weeks
the Primrose Hill got away yesterday.
The twenty men he secured from the

left behind her the Kensington, Chilton

sail. The chances are that some of them
will pay higher wages and do awar with
"blood money." and then they will not
be held so long in the stream.

XXVâ \nCT0R HUGO AND THE
GOLDEN AGE OP FRENCH
FICTION.
BY ARTHUR G. CANFIELD. A.M.
Iri spite of the -conflicting claims of vari
ous schools and with all due regnrd to the
triumphs of later realism and to the great
and original talents that the present gen
| eraiion of novelists in France can boast.
1 It is safe to--* say. without trying to be
; precise about dates, that the "golden age
of French fiction lies in the half-century
between the first and the last of the nov-
I els of Victor Hugo. When in 1S23 he gave
to the world the youthful and fantastic
"Han dlslande" Alfred de Vigny had not
yet produced those historical novels in
', which the imaginative realization of a
past epoch learned from .V.'alter Scott is
deepened and darkened by a profound and
somber philosophy peculiarly his own
("Cinci-Mars," "Stello"); Stendhal had not
yet pointed the way to that cruel and cyn
; ical observation of conduct and analysis
of motive that was to leave such profound
marks on the art of fiction ("Le Rouge
i et le Xoir," "La Chartreuse de Parme'Â»;
Merimee had written none of those well
balanced masterpieces of swift narration,
vivid description and characterization
that will long remain models in their kind
("Colomba." "Carmen." "L'Enlevement
de la Redoute"): Dumas. George Sand and
Balzac were still names unknown. When
"Ninety-Three" appeared in l.<74 all of
these were dead but George Sand, and her
last novel had been written: the best work
of Feuillet, Sandeau, Charbulicz and all
that generation was already done; the
main phases of the evolution that the
novel has accomplished m this century
were fully defined. Flaubert had long be
fore started realism on a new develop
ment with "Madame Bovary" (1So7); the
brothers Goncourt had brought it still fur
ther on its wav toward a scientific method
and a dependence on documentary evi
dence ("Renee Mauperin," "Germinie
Lacerteux"); Alphonse Daudet had al
ready given proof of that rare combina
tion of sympathy and sentiment with
penetrating and minute observation and
of that magic gift of style that
lend his novels such a peculiar and indi
vidual charm ("Le Petit Chose. Fromont
Jeune et Risler Aine"); and Emile Zola
had drawn up the final creed of naturalis
tic or experimental novel, and had
with the pale cast of thought." Here are
no qualms of conscience, no mental strus
ples. no torturing Introspection and self
anaJysls, no war between ideal and con
vention, no carkinj; care. These are "his
torical" novels:, but do not expect pain
ful solicitude for the historic fact. The
actcrs do not disappear behind the cos
tume or the scenery, but pursue their
eager, absorbed way equally unconcerned
for time and place. â¢
George Sand Is the novelist of the heart.
The sprips of what she writes is always
what she has felt. Her first novels ("In
diana." 'â¢Leila") were little else but the
embodiment of her passionate quarrel
with the institution of rr.arriase as It wa3
conventionally understood and practiced
in France. There were protest.* asair^t
convention ard in favor of the free emo
tional life. They lack restraint and wis
dom, being the "work of youth, but they
are sincere. In her revolt against that
standard of moral judgement that under
lay the marriage de convenance. and that
left the voice of the heart altogether out
of ihe question in laying the foundations
of the sanctity of the family, she at first
erected that voice into an infallible ora
cle, nut wider experience tested disas
trously in her own life the worship or
this divinity also, and with her experience
she won a "wiser view. Her hotly unsub
missive heart was allied to an easrer mind
that had the widest ranse of sympathies
and Interests. She saw that society was
afling at more than one point, and she
threw herself ardently into that move
ment ot social theories that so stirred
France between 1<Â® and 1Â«4S. Then her
novels became pleas and arguments,
sometimes terribly long-winded. f-->r so

WARITEB'S BEMEDIZS.
Another Empty Grave.
Chicago, March 3, 1900.
Warner's Safe Cure Co.,
Gentlemen: â I will hi glad to bear testimony to
the value of Warner's Safe Cure for dropsy. I want
those afflicted as I have been to take this life-giver and
get well as I did.
I suffered agony for three years and my life was
despaired o% whÂ»n one day my doctor said: "I guess
I will give you Warner's." Thank God for such a
remedy. It brought me health and new life. I have
used it pretty regularly for a year, but I am well to-day,
and had it not been for Warner's Safe Cure I would
have been in my grave.
Respectfully,
MRS. MELISSA WMTCOMB,
4824 Prairie Ave., Chicago.

CHICAGO, June 7.â The dullness of months
was broken - In . the wheat pit and the space
allotted to dealers In that cereal was Jammed
with an excited crowd, which all at once
seemed to recognize that the crop "in the
Northwest was in Imminent danger of failure.
July opened at 68@6SUc, a shade changed from
last night's . close. Then It began climbing;
traders were filled with Items from all. over
the Northwest. Some said the crop was al
ready seriously damaged, .. others that , unless
rain In plenty came the crop would be a rall
ure and on top of all this the weather bureau
prophesied fair and cool weather. . Recently
these reports have been taken with a grain of
salt and the crowd generally contented Itself
with playing safe â an operation which resulted
In i some very stagnant - sessions. To-day the
Northwest made clamorous - bids - and others
in a sort of panic, followed. In two : hours
from the opening July advanced to 70c. Then
profit-taking sent July back to 69%e. : A huge
amount of buying had already been done on
the advance and the dip was the signal f for

NEW YORK, June 7.â Dun's Review will
say on Saturday: Failures in May were not
only the largest ever kn.own In that month
since such records were made, but of eight
months covered by these returns only six
have shown as large liabilities. Contradictory
though it may appear the report is encourag
ing. There was not a single failure In the
month which was calculated to shake or did
shake commercial credits, which were stronger
at the end of May than at the beginning.
Neither were there any failures or nest of
failures calculated to create alarm about any
particular branch of business.
The large brokerage failure for about $13,000,
000 exceeded in amount all failures in any other
month except one since 1898, and with it came
another for $735,000. Nearly 60 per cent of the
total defaulted liabilities was due to five "other
commercial" failures, while the ten large fail
ures in manufacturing and trading covered
less than $3,000,000 liabilities in all.
The number and amount of liabilities of all
commercial failures in May compared with last
year are given below:
May. 1900. Â£47; 1S99, 6S1. Liabilities, May,
190i). $23,771,151; 18M, $3,820,686.
The returns to Dun's Review for May show
an unusually large number of small failures.
They exceed these of any other year but one,
and this is considered suggestive, also the in
crease of over an eighth in average liabili
ties.
This, the Review Eays, is readily traceable
to the manufactories, for with the surprising
Increase In number the smaller failures In
trading show lower liabilities than In any
other year except two. Manufacturing liabili
ties have much increased, however.- the aver
age for those small firms running close to
$12/100.
It might be Inferred that there has been a
really noteworthy expansion of manufacturing
indebtedness for the season and In January
a similar Increase- appeared, though very llt'
tle In February and March. In April the In
crease was about $1500 per small failure and
in May $3400. It Is not difficult to surmise that
this 1 has connection with the general slackening
of orders for manufactured products, which
has now begun to produce a readjustment of
prices.

liquidation yecterfiay. These facts, taken In
themselves. Indicate declining values for se
curities, but these Incidents had been antici
pated, and, therefore, the movement of prices
was discounted. The Iron stocks were rather
firm on the supposition that the cut in prices
lias brought a step nearer the resumption of
the expected buying demand. Many alarmist
reports were current concerning the North
western wheat crop. The continued heaviness
of foreign stock markets on account of the
complications In Chiua had a sympathetic ef
fect here. The selling of stocks for London
was sufficient to cause a fractional advance In
cable transfers on London. The weekly state
ments of the foreign government banks dis
closed a conservative policy still in force. The
Bank of England returns show only $600,000
in loans repaid to the bank, in spite of the dis
bursement of Government deposits to the
amount of over $S,000,000. and' a prevailing pri
vate rate of discount well below the bank rate.
As the bank is still losing gold for export the
governors refrained from reducing the rate of
discount. The Bank of France has resumed
its policy of both note and loan contraction,
which was interrupted last week and in spite
of & gain in gold of $2,720,000, It has decreased
its note circulation over $25,000,000 and con
tracted Its outstanding loans over $4S,000.0<XÂ».
In Berlin there were forced sales of mining
shares and a reflection of the same policy of
retrenchment. In New York, on the contrary,
money continued In very light demand and in
creased supply.

George Hartman, a big, burly contractor
living at 1101 Rhode Island street, was
charged in Judge Fritz's court yesterday
with disturbing the peace. The complain
ing witness was Mrs. Viola Smith, a
pretty young widow now living at 81SM;
Larkln street.
Mrs. Smith testified that she was en
eajred as housekeeper by Hartman and
was there four weeks. When she asked
for her wapos he refused to pay up. She
had finished a big day's washing at the
time and he threw a washtub at her and
cha. c ed her out of the house. He was in
the habit of drinkinp heavily and bulry

U Mr= ? Smith's little girl was In court, and
when she f*aw Hartman she began to cry
and bets her mother "to come away," as
nh*> was afraid of him.
Hartman in his defense said that Mrs.
Smith was constantly flirting with his
men and did not attend to her duties.
He had two painters at the house and she
kept them from doing their work by al
ways smiling at them. He denied that he
ever drank too much liquor. He said that

to walk over them.
The Judge advised Hartman to pay Mrs.
Smith the wages due her. and continued
the case till to-morrow. He thought the

deadly weapon, the court looking" on a

THE constitutional right of criminals
at the San Francisco bar to a fair
and impartial trial Is in jeopardy.
Jurors are human, but they are
likely to become Inhuman in their judg
ment when torn from the bosom of a
thrifty business and deprived of even a
iuror's fees they are forced to pay for
their own coffee and anchors, while a
briefly authoritative bailiff guards them
wi'h eve and gun. They arc apt to lay
the blame for their woes on the allege
trar-^gresFor of the law whose fate .the}
hod in their hands. His finish Is then a
matter of easy fixing by the twelve good,
mad men and true.
A few days ago a Jury In Judge Law
lor's court agreed to disagree until* at
least after the meal hour. The Sheriff
was forthwith ordered to wine and dine
his charges. Whether or not that officer
detected an unusually hungry vacancy of
the eye or stomach he said not, but he
balked anyway. "I now have to keep a
profit and loss account on jurors', meals."
he said, "and upon'the unpopular sitle of
this sheet my eyes have often rested on
the symbol $3S. If any dispenser of food
in the neighborhood, however, will trust
this untrustworthv city you may eat."
The keeror of a near-by Inn saUl that he
"Vud drust dot cidy yes not." but rather
than agree just then the twelve good men
and true decided to continue the agony
of their victim a few minutes longer.
They took up a collectlcn. They con
sumed a bite and as they ate reached the
unanimous conclusion that the prisoner
at the bar was guilty, plainly guilty â
guilty as guilt itsejf. After getting even
the jurors went their way and are now in
disguise, that the Sheriff may not again
banquet them at their own expense.
â¢ Sheriff Lackmann has informed Judges
Lav/lor. CookÂ» and Dunne that he has no
way or means of providing meals for
jurors. This will probably lead to the
suspension of all criminal calendars for
the balance of the month. If this course
is decided upon talesmen can again with
Safety come out Into the light of the world
and commune with their free fellow men.

THEIR ROMANCE
KEPT A SECRET
FOR MANY DAYS
Marriage of 'Earl B. Hough
and Beatrice Singleton
on the Hartford.
Second Ceremony Celebrated Seven
Months Later After the Dis
closure of the Union Had
Been Made. -
The announcements are made on the
eve- of the departure for Honolulu of Mr.
and Mrs. Hough, whose relatives ana
friends have been greatly astonished by
the news of the double weddings.
The young couple kept the secret of
their union so carefully that it was not
until a few days ago that the parent*
knew anything of the circumstances.
Immediately after the unusual marriago
o . the famous frigate, then at Mare Isl
and, young Hough and his contract bride
returned to their respective homes in San
Leandro and continued to meet only in
the most casual w;.y.
The tender to the bridegroom of a posi
tion in Hawaii led to disclosures. Neither
his wife nor himself desired to be parted
from each other, so the secret was re
vealed. Then, to satisfy the wish Â©f par
ents, the second ceremony was celebrated.
The families directly concerned have
given their approval now that the facts
have become known. The young people
will leave for the'.r island Tiome with the
congratulations of a host of friends.
Mrs Hough Is a daughter of Mr. and.
Mrs Charles Singleton. Her brother is
connected with the Best Manufacturing
Works at San T-eandro. The groom Is a
son of W. J. Hough, superintendent of
the San Leandro Gas Works. The young
'man was for some time In the employ or
Taber. the San Francisco photographer.
The romantic marriage last November
of Earl B. Hough and Beatrice Singleton,
members of prominent families of San
Leandro. was made public to-day. In fact
there were two weddlnga. The first was
solemnized by contract in the presence cC
Chaplain McDonald on the United State*
snip Hartf rd. November 3. last year.
The second ceremony was celebrated last
Tuesday at San Rafael a: the Presbyter
ian church, R<;v. David James officiating-

Investigation Proves That the
Charges Made by Two Private
Detectives Are. False.
Chief of Police Sullivan has suspended
three officers from duty on a charge that
they permitted Chinese to violate the
quarantine rules established in the Chi
nese quarter. While there is no question
that the Chinese are passing In and out
of Chinatown, an impartial investigation
shows that a serious Injustice has been
done to the three accused men in this
instance. The three men are Thoma3
Murphy, Maurice Hehan and Matthew L.
Tierney. the last named two not long in
the department. OfHcer Murphy is, how
ever, an old and tried patrolman. His re
liability, judgment and efficiency have
been used frequently in advocacy of his
promotion on the force, and it seems un
fortunate that under such conditions a
charge, which inquiry proves to be false,
should be made ngainst him. He has
served in many responsible capacities and
was one of the best officers on the China
town detail when quarantine was estab
lished. It is more unfortunate that the
charge against him is based upon the tes
timony of a private detective.
When rumor began to circulate that
Chinese were passing in and out of China
town. <*hief Sullivan decided- to do every
thing In his power to prevent the violation
of the quarantine. He employed two pri
vate detectives to watch the patrolmen
and the result is their charge against the
officers who were suspended last night.
The accused men say tnat they can dem
onstrate to the satisfaction of the Chief
that the accusations are false. In the
first place, they knew of the presence of
the private detectives in Chinatown and
knew that they were employed by some
authority to *cc that the rules of the
quarantine were obeyed. In the second
place, the accused officers are fortunately
in a position to produce the Chinese who
was it is charged, admitted to the d!s
trict They have many more incidental
details to offer and it seems regretable
that upon the word of a private detective
their reputation and standing In the de
partment should be injured even by a
false accusation.

WIVES OF TWO
LAWYERS FILE
DIVORCE SUITS
Trouble is brewing in Chinatown. Dis
fattraction has been rife among the pent
up Chinese and yesterday the news that
the case before the Circuit Court had been
postponed brought it to a head. A large
crowd gathered outside the headquarters
of the Six compank-s and threatened *o
do ?Â»rious damage. The situation Was ox
plained to them and the crowd dispersed
orly to gather again some hours later and
more threatening demonstrations were
made. Again the officers of the Six Com
l^nies pacified the angered Celestials an!
again they dispersed, but they gather.J
a third time, .but without further demon
stration. They did a great deal pf talk
.ng. however, and the incident is con-
Fiaered signiJicant.
The Six Companies and the Consul have
no faith in the new special detail for
Chinatown. The Consul believes they will
not be strong enough to quell any serious
disturbance and he is anxious to have
regular police put on patrol duty within
the lines. The Chinese are not afraid of
the new specials, he Fays, and if their
services should be badly needed he fears.
they would be found inadequate. The
higher classes of the Chinese are becom
ing worried over the situation, for en
forced idleness is giving the inhabitants
of the quarantined section plenty of time
to hatch plots and plan disturbances anS
Mots, and if they get hungry they will
take to rioting just as any other nation
ality would do under the circumstances.
The quarantine situation is at a etand-
EtUl, for the case before the Circuit Court
has pone over to next Wednesday morn
ing and nothing can be done until that
has been decided. In the meantime the
temporary restraining order allows the
physicians of the Six Companies to pa^s
Â£ a 5r EE P r< md-?d the rules of the Board
fi, t-allh have been complied with. No

the conditions upon which the attorneys
/ ij 1 , < -Â£ Ineiie agreed to allow the Board
ci iiea.th time to answer its complaint
was that there Fhould be no removal of

iilternoon. but outside of providing for
**) Chinese reported as being on the verge
, s * al 2"ation nothing of moment was
cone - "he results of the meeting yester
day between the merchants and the at
torneys for the Chinese were reported.
:>ut as the conference amounted to ab
i-o.utely nothing there was not much
either to discuss or to report.
The conference was held in due form,
tut the merchants found the Chinese and
their attorneys at- tenacious of their po
sition as sure winners. They absoiuteiy
icfusea to discuss anything less than a
withdrawal of the quarantine and then
they announced they would be willing to
alscuas the proposition of quarantining
UWivWnil hous< s supposed to be infected
or fcvÂ« n neighborhoods under suspicion. I
The proposition of the merchants was Â¦
li.at the attorneys would not oppose th-3 i
r> moval of Chinese during the pendency |
of the suit, as the health of the city do- !
c.anded such action, but the attorneys
refused to consider any proposition that
carnÂ«d with it the possible removal of
any Chinese. They will rely on their
ruitl and they feel sure of winning.
The Health Beard received an applica
ti â¢:Â¦ from George H. Pippy at yestecday"s
meeting askinji that ten Chinese be re
. isexJ from quarantine in order that they
:: i> join an expedition about to le*ve for
t â¢ ria. On Dr. McCarthy's motion the
Batter of releasing the Chinamen was
i laced in the hands of Dr. Klnyoun. as-
Flstant surpeon of the Marine "Hospital. I
I t. VMlllamaon held that it would be a !
Â¦ r:ci rous precedent to establish, as once
the Chinamen were out of Chinatown they
< nuid not get back, and it was desirable
that the Federal officials take the matter i
!!. hand in order to avoid any complica- I
t: â¢>:..-. Should the Chinese be refused pas- j
Ease to Slberia'they will be taken imme
tliuteiy to one of the detention stations
:. w being prepared at Mission Rock and
: l.-land.
-J to than a hundred Chinamen congre
gated on the third floor of the Appraiser's
building yesterday for the purpose of lls
:â¢ Tiirig to the argument expected to be
made before United States Circuit Judge
Morrow on the petition for a restraining
order against the City Hoard of Health.
The greater portion of the Chines**' audi
tors euuld neither t^peak nor understand
English, but they were there to lend their
moral support to the eminent counsel rep
resenting them. The Salvation Army was !
r< presented by two pretty lassies, and the
Christian Chinese missions were in ovi
d^no? in the persons of a dozen lady mis
t-ionaricfi.
On behalf of the petitioners appeared
Joseph C Campbell of Reddy, Campbell
A: Metson. Jam*-*! G. Maguire of Maguire
& Gallagrher. John E. Bennett and Sam
uel M. Shortrldge of Beatty & Shortridge.
Crier John T. Grey called the court to or
der at 11 o'clock, aÂ« Judges Morrow and
De Haven took th*>ir seats on the bench.
It had been whispered about before
hand that the counsel for the city had
not had sufficient time in which to pre
pare the . evidence necessary' to show
cause why the quarantine should not be
raised, and when Charles L. Weller, Af
r:s'.-i nt District Attorney, made that
statement no surprise was manifested.
J. C. Campbell asked that Mr. Weller ;
pive the court an assurance that none of
the thre-ats made against the Chinese by
the Iicard of Health would be carried out,
M;rh as taking Chinese to quarantine on
Mission Rock or AngÂ«l Island, and that
the Board of Health provide pome method
of feeding the imprisoned indigent Asi
atics.
â¢*Of course." said Mr. Weller in reply.

An adjournment was then declared until

Gacre Has Answered Hay
Asleep on Duty.
WASHINGTON, Juno 7.â The Chinese
MiniMer. VÂ»'u Ting Fang, was the first
caller of tho day at thÂ« Bttlfl Department.
He was concerned with the unfortunate
plight of the Chinese within the quaran
tine lines at San Francisco. He made
come strong representations to Secretary
Hay in critiHsm of the health officials
who are administering the quarantine.
B<-cretarv Hay has received a reply from
the Governor of California in answer to
his reautst for a report upon the com
plaint of the Chinese Minister of discrim
ination scainst the Chinese. The Govcr
r.nr'n answer is an explanation of tne
pravo conditions which confront the btate
officials in their efforts to stamp out the
plague, accompanied by an intimation
that every effort will be made to abate
the rigor* of the quarantine law in favor
of thÂ» Chinese wherever this can be done
in fcafety.
Policeman John P. Wocst was suspend
ed by ChiÂ«f Sullivan last nljrht for sleep
ing at bis pof=t of duty. Woest had been
puitinned in the rear of â¬1S California

HIS INTERVIEW
WITH FAIRBANK
TRAIN ROBBERS
J. T. Hughes Returns From
Visit Near an Apache
Chiefs Stronghold.
Alvord, Stiles and Bravo Juan, Who
Escaped From Prison, Declare
. They Never Will Be Re-
Alvord said that while he expected to
give himself up he was going to stay with
Stiles and Bravo Juan as Ions as they
were in Arizona and make the tight with
them. They all said they had no fear of
being: taken by the officers. They had
visited Willcox, Dragoon, Pierce, Cochise
and many ranches. Stiles twice visited
his mother at Casa Grande. They all de
clared they would never be taken alive.
They cut the interview short by saying,
"We must be off," then ordered the re
porter and guard to remain there thirty
minutes, then drive four miles south,
under penalty. They tlien dashed out into
the darkness. Â¦.'..":
Stiles stated that Wells-Fargo detectives
had promised him $1000 and a secret ser
vice position if he would turn State's evi
dence and implicate the others who par
ticipated in the Cochise train robbery,
but that the officers had failed to carry
out the promise and he was playing for
even when he made the Tombstone jail
delivery. He said he was going to keep
after them. He had no feeling against
anybody except the man who broke his
promise, and would risk his life in getting
even.
The interview Ia3ted an hour. Alvord
declared hi3 innocence and said that ho
would present himself for trial as soon
as he was assured of an immediate trial.
Stiles and Bravo Juan proposed to tight
it out unless certain concessions were
granted. They have no fear of the offi
cers and all are heavily armed. They are
provided with prime mounts and are on
good terms with the cowboys, who keep
them well supplied with food and ammu
nition.
TUCSON, Ariz., June 7.â John T.
Hughes, son of ex-Governor Hughes, has
returned from the foothills of the Rincon
Mountains, east of Tucson, near the
stronghold of Cochlse, the famous Apache
chief. Hughes met by secret appointment
Alvord, Stiles and Bravo Juan, the Co
chise and Fairbank train robbers, who
broke jail two months ago at Tombstone.

No Disturbance of Any Kind
Reported During the -
Governor Stephens Receives a Letter
Threatening Him With Death
if He Does Not Call Out
Militia.
Governor Stephens says he has not the
support of th*Â» press and citizens of St
Louis in his efforts to preserve order and
that these letters are the -natural result
of the constant attacks of the news
papers and others.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. June 6. 1300.â To Mr.
Stephens. Governor of Missouri. Jefferson City:
If you do not call out the State militia in a
few days you will be shot. Respectfully.
E. EVERMORE.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., June 7.âGov
ernor Stephens is annoyed by letters re
ceived from St.^Louis, threatening him If
'he does not call out the militia to sup
press streetcar strike riots, and others
threatening him if he does call out the
militia. This morning he received the fol
lowing card:
Aside from the running of night cars on
the Lindell line the past twenty-four
hours have brought out practically no
new developments in the strike situation.
Twenty-five sticks of dynamite were un
earthed by the police to-day.
Five sticks were found buried under the
Eastern avenue car tracks at Easton and
Vandeventer avenues and twenty addi
tional sticks were found in an abandoned
shed at Broadway and Gasconade street,
in the immediate neighborhood of the
power-house of the Southern Electric
Company. The dynamite found on the
Easton avenue tracks had been made into
a bomb and placed under the rail. Had
a car passed over It at the time the con
veyance probably would have been blown
to atoms.
ST. LOUIS, June 7.â Cars were run on
one line of the St. Louis Transit system
to-night for the first time since the strike
was declared, j almost a . month ago. In
many quarters It was feared that trouble
would occur as soon as darkness fell, but
at a late hour the Chief of Police had re
ceived no intelligence of the gathering of
crowds along the line operated and no
fracas of any character had been report
ed. The line selected to make the test
is what is known as the Lindell division.
Every car carried a police guard and in
addition the thoroughfares along the en
tire route were patrolled by police officers
and companies of the posse comitatus, the
latter armed v with riot shotguns. As the
Lindell division passes for the most part
through the respectable portion, of the
city, it is not apprehended that trouble
will occur.
Kobbs Acquitted.
SUISUN. June ".âThe jury in the case
of Charles Hobbs. charged with the mur
der of Joseph Curran at Vallejo, to-day
brought in a verdlc^of not guilty.
CHICAGO, June ".-Thomas D. Cottrell,
an old and well-known speculator on
the Board of Trade, shot himself In
the head to-day. His brother, Ed
ward Cottrell of New York, who years
ago was one of the heaviest speculators
on the board. Is now in an Insane asylum
near New York. Despondency over Ed
ward Cottrell's condition as well as finan
cial reverses is believed to have been re
sponsible for the attempted suicide. It
is said the bullet wound will prove fatal.

Many Blocks of Land. Have Recently
Been Bonded Upon Supposed
indications of Oil.
Oil may be ' struck in San Francisco,
south of Golden Gate Park and well out
toward the-ocecn. Within the past ten
days property-owners have notified Shain
wald & Buckbce to withdraw from sale
between twenty-five and fifty blocks of
land in that vicinity. The reason as
signed for such action was that brokers
had tried to bond the land for thirty
days. Tho property-owners have the Idea
that seepages of oil have been discovered
in. that section.
Mr. Shalnwald of Shainwald & Buckbee
said last night It had been intimated that
Indications of oil, or what was supposed
to be oil, had been found. He knew noth
ing concerning any oil discoveries. In
formation was received from another
source that the lands are between
Golden Gate Park and the .old
Ocean House, and from Fortieth
avenue to. the ocean. The report is also
In circulation that oil seepages have been
found on the lands of the Sutro estate,
in what Is known as ."Car Town," near
the ocean beach. Some of the Sutro heirs
have been sufficiently Interested to put In
a sand pump to gain some knowledge of
the geological formation of their land.
From this the bonding of certain prop
erties has resulted. Derricks may soon
be erected" for. the purpose of boring for

BENEFIT FOR SUNDAY
LECTURE ASSOCIATION
The concert, vocal and instrumental,
given in the Metropolitan Temple last
evening for the benetit of the Sunday Lec
ture Association was a very meritorious
affair. It embraced a staccato from
Wldor's fifth symphony, which was per
formed on the organ by "William B. Kins,
one of Widor's pupils, very cleverly; two
part songs by Spofl'orth ' and Fanning,
which were given by the Choral Club of
twenty young-, ladies and gentlemen; a
bravura song-*so it was described on the
programmeâ by Luckstone, which was
cleverly done by Mrs. Susie Hert-Mark,
although the programme description was
a misnomer; a harp solo by Airs Nathan
I>andsberger; a 'contralto solo, "O ma
Lyre l'rumortelle," by Gounod, which was
sung dramatically and effectively by Mrs.
Grace Morei-Dickman; "Salve Dlmora,"
from "Faust," by Alfred Wllkie; two
pleasing little madrigals of the sixteenth
century, bubbling over, with quaint melo
dic graces, which were sung by Mrs. Hert-
Mark, MrÂ«. Dickman and Messrs. Wilkle
and Lloyd; "There'll Never Be One Like
You," rendered by Robert Lloyd; a
Wienlawski number for the violin, which
gave opportunity for an exhibition of the
technical skill and singing tone of Nathan
Landsberger; a duet by Dudley Buck,
"Dews of the Summer Night," sung by
Mrs. Dickman, and Mr. "Wilkie and
Gounod's "Ave Maria," with violin and
harp accompaniment, sung by Mrs. Hert-
Mark. ;
This Indicates variety, but not all the
variety, for every number on the pro
gramme was followed by an encore, . so
that the performance was long. There
has not been a better planned concert In
a long time. Some of the success was due
to' a. clever accompanist, who modestly
kept his name off the programme.
OX Tuesday afternoon shortly after
5 o'clock Miss Emma Smith at
tempted suicide in a room in the
rear of Dehay's liquor store at 518
Valencia street. At the time the un
fortunate girl was In the company of Dr.
Walter S. Thorne of the Harbor Hospital
and another physician friend, who rushed
out to summon the police and more med
ical aid. By the time the called-for as
sistance arrived Miss Smith had, by
means of a back door, been spirited away
and the crowd which had assembled at
the wild shrieks of Thorne and his friend
were left without any solution to the mys
terious attempt at self-destruction.
The girl who attempted to take her life
for no apparent reason and without any
evident forethought is the daughter of
a banker and a graduate of Mills Sem
inary. She is an extremely handsome
blonde and enjoys the reputation of being
a "good fellow." Miss Smith lives with
her mother at 522^j Valencia street.
Banker Smith and his wife have been
separated for some time, but up to two
months ago he has made ample provisions
for the daughter who on Tuesday last at
tempted to shufile oft the mortal coil.
The curiosity of the neighborhood to
learn the details of the attempt at self
destruction is no greater than thac of
the girl's own mother. To her anxious
questions the daughter has given but
evasive answers, and all the information
the poor woman who has a right to thÂ«i
confidence of Emma Smith has i3 the
crumbs the daughter has dropped at odd
moments and what she has been able tu
gather from the neighbors who hastened
to the scene of the mystery.
"I went out on Tuesday early in the
afternoon," faid the heart-broken mother.
"When 1 left the house Emma, was at
home, but when I returned, at about 5
o'clock, she was no longer there. As It
came on toward 6 o'clock I looked out of
the window to see whether I could see
her coming. I saw there was considerable
Up to about two months ago -Emma's
father made liberal provisions for her.
Then he wanted her to come and make
her home with him. She refused, as the
discipline of a father's home was not to
her liking. He objected to her friends
and she took offense At his objections.
Emma Smith's attempt at self-destruc
tion evidently had no further results than
providing the Mission district with a well
seasoned mystery. She was out last even
ing, visiting a sick friend, and the mother,
who remained at home trying to unravel
the whys and wherefores of the attempted
suicide, sighed when she said: "I really
wished Emma were at rest forever."
There is apparently no common inter
ests between Emma Smith and her
mother, who declares that the girl has
been foolish and headstrong and hard to
manage. According to her mother she
has been keeping company with Thorne
for several years but there has been no
question of betrothaJ or marriage between
them.
"I don't think my daughter would
marry him." the mother said.
"Since then I have questioned my
daughter closely," said the mother, "and
from the little she told me I understand
that she went into Dehay's place to use
the telephone. There she met Thorne.
They had a quarrel. Then one of the
party said. "What's in life anyhow? 1 and
Emma, taking something, a vial or a po
tion, I don't know which, from Thorne,
drank it down, saying 'Here goes.' Then
Thorne got excited and rushed out for
medical assistance and rang in for the
ambulance."
commotion in the street and rushed down
stairs. Then I heard that my daughter
had tried to take her life in Dehay's store.
I rushed into the wine shop and tried to
Ko to my daughter, but they would not
let me see her. Dr. Thome and a friend
of his were with her at the time. Thome
was under the influence of liquor. After
a time Emma. Thorno and his friend
came upstairs to me. :
" 'What did you take?' I asked raj
daughter, but she just answered, 'Oh,
nothing;' and dressed and went out with
Thorne and his friend.

Yesterday** meeting- "was called for the
purpose of adopting the record of the de
cision in the Kilpatriek trial. As the rec

adjourned until this morning.
COURAGE OF TEACHERS
IS HIGHLY COMMENDED
We are therefore of the opinion, upon prin
ciple and authority, that the afss-ssment as
t<i the jlalntlJ?. Mackay. was void. â¢ â¢ â¢ V.'e
do not thir.k that the facts of this- case bring
the bo&ds as to the interest ot the plaintiff.
Dey, within the iu!e. As trustee he is the
owner of an undivided one-half cf them. â¢ â¢
They have not lo?t their identity simply
tiy being on deposit in a bank in New York
City. â¢ â¢ â¢ We advise that the Judgment bs
reversed and the court below dire'-ted to enter
Judgment en the finding? in favor of the plaint
iffs in the turn cf 114.222 and interest thtreoa
at the legaJ rate since November IS. 1&95.
It was so ordered by the Justices.
The decision pocs on to say that the
fconds could not be assessed to the trus
tees, either in San Francisco, Nevada or
New York, because both do not live in
cither place, and adds:
The plaintiff* therefore as trustees -were the
owners of the le<ral title to the property at
the time of the aswfsnient. The general rule
Is that personal property in the hand* of a
trustee is to be ass:*sed to him at his place
of domicile.
At the time of the distribution the
bends mentioned were In a bank in New
York City, deposited in the names of the
trtastee* jointly. The Tax Collector of
this city compelled the payment of the
taxes thereon to the amount of $28,445,
but the payment was made under protest
and action was brought to recover the
same. In the lower court judgment went
to the city, and an appeal was taken. The
Supreme Court states that the question
to be determined was the situs of the
bonds for the purpose of taxation. Com
missioner Cooper, who wrote the decision,
cays:
Mrs. Fair died in 1*91. leaving a will in
which Mackay and Dey were named as
trustees and executors. Among ihe assets
cf the estate were bonds of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company of Arizona and
bonds of the West Shore Railroad Com
pany of TCew York, aggregating: in value
SI .262 .000. In August. lb&4. the administra
tion of the estate was closed, and a de
cree of final distribution was entered
Â¦whereby these bonds and certain other
personal and real property were distribut
ed to Mackay and Dey as trustees under
the terms of the will. At the time of
distribution Mackay was a legal resident
of Nevada and lived in New York City.
where he transacted the greater part of
his business. Dey was and is a resident
of San I'rancisco.
An interesting decision has been handed
down by the Supreme Court in the case
of John W. Mackay and R. V. Dey. trus
tees under the will of the late Theresa
Fair, apalnst ihe city of San Francisco
and former Tax Collector J. N. Block.

SUPREME COURT
OPINION FAVORS
FAIR TRUSTEES
Another peculiarity in the budget is the
Item of "interest and sinking fund, new,
J20S,500," for which a tax of .0556 has been
levied, also outside of the dollar limit.
This amount represents what the bonds
for the park panhandle, new school
houses and sewers will cost the taxpayers
next year, and yet the bonds have not
yet been issued and their legality has not
even: yet been passed upon by the court
before which the test case was taken.
Should the bonds be declared illegal the
amount collected for interest and sinking
fund will be of no avail and the tax
payers will have been mulcted to the tune
of J20S.500. At any rate the money will be
available long before the bonds are ready
to be floated, should the decision be in
their favor.
On and before the last Monday of June in
each year the Supervisors shall levy the
amount of taxes for city and county purposes
required to be levied upon all property not ex
empt from taxation. The amount shall be
sufficient to provide for the payment during
the fiscal yejlr of all demands upon the treas
ury authorized to be paid out of the same;
but such levy, exclusive of the State tax and
the tax to pay the Interest and maintain the
sinking fund of the bonded Indebtedness of
the city and county and exclusive of the tax
to pay for the maintenance and improvement
of the parks, squares and public grounds, shall
not exceed the rate of one dollar on each $100
valuation of the property assessed.
It -is very probable that this item will
have to be eliminated from the levy. The
peculiar fact is developed that the money
for the protested taxes was duly paid into
the city treasury and absorbed in the
general fund. Now it is asserted that the
money has been paid out. and so the tax
payers are to bo taxed to pay back these
sums, which the city has used for vari
ous purposes.
In the tax budget which was adopted
by the Board of Supervisors last Monday
provision was made for a levy of .0113. in
addition to the rate of 51 for the city's
current expenses, for the repayment of
taxes and bonds paid under protest, and
amounting to $66,785. In making this pro
vision, the board has exceeded its powers,
as the charter expressly specifies that the
only levy allowed outside of the dollar
limit is for interest, sinking and park
funds. The-.board, therefore, had no au
thority vested in it to levy a tax in ad
dition to the dollar for municipal expedl
tures in order to repay those taxes which
must now be returned to the propeity
owners The section of the charter bear-
Ing on the tax levy is as follows:
Only the Park, Interest and Sinking
Funds May Be Provided For
Outside of the Fixed
Eate.
Sum to Repay Protested
Taxes Is Not Collectable
Under Charter.

house must be closed shortly and her li
cense revoked. They each exhibited a star

They returned three or four days later
and said she would have to close that
nisht. Miyakawa wanted $25 to fix things.
Y. Katyama. another Japanese woman,
corroborated the previous witness. Miva
kawa asked her to call at his office. ShÂ©
went and he told her he must have $23
from Muira or the place would be closed.
She told him she would not be a mes
senper for him for such a purpose. He
locked her In his office and kept her there
