SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JUNE 21, 1900,
The President passed a quiet but some
what anxious day, for he was not advised
until late In the afternoon that the man
agers had concluded to defer the nomi
nation until to-morrow. Up to that point
he was kept fully informed, by his trusted
friends and supporters. Although he has
no anxiety as to the results, yet he would
have felt better to be relieved of the men
tal strain which naturally accompanies
postponements and delays. With the ad
ditional telegraphic and: telephonic equip
ment in the executive mansion he has
every facility for obtaining the news al
mostMnstantaneously from the conyen-'
tion. ' : . ' . .- ,

although the latter has few promises of
support outside of. his own delegation.
A number of , the Colorado delegates
called upon the. Massachusetts delegation
to-night and proposed that If the Massa
chusetts delegates would propose the
amendment to the rules suggested by
Senator Quay they would support Secre
tary Long for the Vice Presidential nom
ination. 'The offer was declined. A dele
gate from Colorado, however, said to
night that if Roosevelt's name were
placed before the delegates to-morrow for
Vice President the delegation would sup
port him. | Roosevelt, he said, was very
strong throughoufthe coal counties, arid,"
In fact. -the whole State, and would poll
10,000 more votes for the national and
State I ticket than any other Vice' Presi
dential candidate now in the field.
The Oklahoma delegation is a unit on
the ."Olce Presidency. If. however, Roose
velt's name dees not come up the delega
tion, will be divided between Dolliver and-
Woodruff. The delegates say they will be
guided by what Kansas does.

placed before the convention the delega
tion, so some ol ' the delegates say. will
divide its support between the Massachu
setts' and Iowa candidates. 2
Delegate Tyler Worden of Montana said
to-night that his State was for a Western
man, Tripp preferred, if Roosevelt did not
run. When told that Tripp would decline
in all probability he aaid they would go
for Dolliver. If New Tork would agree,
on some other man than Woodruff they
would support him as a matter of expedi
ency, but they would not accept the can
didacy of Mr. Woodruff.
"We are solid for Roosevelt," Bald
Chairman Burton of the Kansas delega
tion. "He will be nominated, he will ac
cept and he will be the next Vice Presi
dent of this country. We told him yester
day that we thought he should make the
race and naturally after that we could da
nothing else but vote for htm."
Although Chairman Burton was confi
dent that the delegation would vote for
Roosevelt, several members announced
that they preferred Dolliver, but that they
would give up their preference if Roose
velt would run. The Indorsement of Wood
ruff cut no figure with this delegation,
and theyjsald th,ey would not accept him
under any circumstances.

WALTON. PHILADELPHIA. June Â»>.â
Early this morning. Just as the Califor
nians were assembling, the delegation
from Massachusetts cailed In a body. The
Bay State delegates were received cor
dially. Michael J. Murray of Co.iton made
an excellent speech, eulogizing California
and Californians, and then went into an
advocacy of the candidacy of Secretary
cf ihe Navy John Ij. Long. Dr. Pardee
made n happy response and Fa:d that if
Secretary Long should receive the nom
ination it would certainly 1^0 an excellent
selection., Ayer a fow more pleasantries

H. G. Kond cf San Jose, delegate from
the Fifth, was suggested by California
for honorary vice chairman of the" con
vention, each State baring such a selec
tion. "
Tlic COrf^V.on hnd previously provided
a eolid gold badge similar in design to
tho one worn by the California delegates.
It was decided .to aj>r>o;at a committee of
zlx to proceed to "Washington after the
convention to present this gold badge to
President McKinley. Those appointed on
She committee are Rov.ell, Grant, Par-
dee. Powers, Wilson and Arnold. M. A.
Gunst was appointed, but on account of
his engagement In New York could not
accept. ,
The delegation went out to the conven
tion hall and remained through the ses
sion. The evening was spent In return-
Ing social visits. A large number of del
egates went first to the West Virginia
headquarters. C S. Grant was the center
of attraction by reason of his remarkable
resemblance to his illustrious father. The
Callfcrnlans returned the call of the Mas.
sachuBetts delegation. Dr. Pardee and
Dr. Rowell made happy speeches. Ohio
was next visited and then the delegation
called on Governor Roosevelt. The Gov
ernor was cordial In his greeting and ex
pressed a hearty desire to visit San Fran
cisco and hoped he would be assigned to
make a few speeches on the Pacific Coast
this campaign.
The delegation then proceeded to the
Harrison Club. This Is known In Phila
delphia as- Sheriff Crow's club. The Sher
iff has been most kind and a great recep
tion was in store for the delegation. A
sumptuous spread, a flow of champagne
and a. vaudeville show followed. â¢
The Kentucky delegation also was on
hand; led by Governor Taylor. The Gov
ernor made a speech and was followed by
United States Senator de Boe, Judge Den

Plans 'for" the 'Nomination. "
" There was a conference in Senator

close friends of ahe administration took
part. It was understood that Roosevelt

question. of how, it" was to be. done, wheth-
PHILADELPHIA,- June.\20.-Senafdr
'Hanna's announcement in favor *of
Roosevelt to-nigtat was made after
a long consultation with many lead
ers of the partyi He called all ..the
newspapermen into, erne of : the ' rooms,
where- the consultations had taken place
and read Mt from manuscript. â¢
Just before the statement was given out
Chairman Odell of New York spent a few
minutes in the room, and when he came
out said:' . . â¢
"The whole matter got Into a snarl arid
was left to' Senator Hanna to arbitrate
and v his decision, is that the Vice Presi
dency should go to New York and Roose
velt will be nominated."'
The programme Is to have Iowa with
draw Dolliver and nominate Roosevelt.
Massachusetts , will withdraw Long and
second the nomination. Probably other
States with candidates will foliow suit.
This will enable the convention to finish
Its business and adjourn to-morrow.
Lafayette Young, who has been cham
pioning the candidacy of Representative
Dolliver, said that no other name than
that of Roosevelt would be presented.
"I understand that Mr. Hanna will pre
sent Governor Roosevelt," he said, "and
if that be true, it Is useless to name any
other man, ap,d Roosevelt will-be npmin
ated by ;acclamation:'_' ,' ;.. .. . *.;. Â£Â¦}
In connection' with the position of Mr.
Dolliver, it Is probable that he will^sit as
a delegate, fit the "schYnie* goes through,
when the roll Is 'called' for the nomination
of- Vice . President.. Alabama,, the first
Â£tate. will yield- to Iowa,- and- Dolliver- will
nominate Roosevelt. This, it is believed,
Governor Roosevelt for Vice President b>
acclamation. Mr. Dolliver authorized the
following- statement:
"My candidacy has been wholly unso
licited. . I; have not up to this moment
spoken â¢ one , word seeking the nomination
to even a- member of my own delegation.
To-night. Mr. Long, Mr. Scott and myself
placed our candidates in Mr. Hanna's
hands â¢ to dispose . of as he saw " fit. It
Â¦was agreed that our names would not be
presented to the convention, and upon my
request Lafe Young of my State will place
Mr. Roosevelt's name In nomination In
behalf of the nation. I believe that the
name of Governor Roosevelt on the ticket
will give it greater strength and enthu
siasm than the name of any other man la
America,"
Contrary to expectations. Governor
Roosevelt appeared at his headquarters*
about 9 o'clock and the first thins he did
was to absolutely deny the story that Mr.
Platt had thn-atened him with defeat as
a Gubernatorial candidate if he refused
the Vice Presidential nomination.
' "The story Is an unqualified falsehood,
without the shadow of foundation," ho
said. VV' t
He had not been in his room long before
delegations from California and Maryland
called to assure him of support, and he
did not express to them any sorrow over
the result. Later a delegation from Iowa
called and announced that they had with
drawn their candidate. Mr. Dolliver. and
would vote for Mr. Roosevelt. Massachu
setts called "to say that Senator Lodge de-;
sired to see the Governor, and he left the
rooms and did not return again. He de
clined before leaving to make any state-,
ment.
again.
So well convinced was he of the irresistible demand for Roosevelt for Vice President that
he yielded to the advice of his friends and returned to New York this afternoon. Never did a
great politician accomplish a difficult task under greater disadvantages. Senator Platt has been
the quietest figure and one of the most influential in the convention. He has proven himself an
adroit politician. Suffering constantly the most intense pain from his broken rib and almost help
less from fatigue, he has kept in touch with the situation for five days. He has abused no one
and he has kept his temper throughout with the exception of last night, when he is reported to
have told Roosevelt that he would oppose him for Governor and Roosevelt in reply defied him.
The Governor, however, has been forced to abandon his position on the Vice Presidency by
the earnest demand that he should go on the ticket which pervades the entire convention and
comes with the greatest vigor from the West.
Roosevelt in the convention wore his Rough. Rider hat, and he looked an almost burly fig
ure in contrast with the close-knitted, clean-limbed boy who wore a straw hat in the convention
of 1884 and stood on a chair every time he made a motion or speech in the fight between'Blaine,-
Arthur and Edmunds. He was appointed one of the committee to escort Senator Lodge, the per
manent chairman, to the stage and the audience and delegates again had an opportunity to let
loose their yells and cheers. Again when he rose to leave the convention hall he got another cor
dial greeting. . : > .
The Californians who wouldihave supported the administration have now concluded to yotef
for Roosevelt. : Vi

They were waiting to hear .'from Secre

CALL HEADQUARTERS, HOTEL WALTON, PHILADELPHIA, June 20.â McKinley and Roosevelt
will be the ticket. Both nominations will be made by acclamation. The rush to Roosevelt
to-day has been followed by the withdrawal of Long, Dolliver,. Washburn and Woodruff.
Beneath the smiling party skies Hanna and Platt smoked the pipe of peace. A real Roose
velt sunburst ushered in the dawn. The Schuylkill and Delaware rippled in the snapping Roose
velt breeze. The great convention hall rocked and trembled, not once but three times, to hearty
Roosevelt cheers, and to-night everybody professes his ability to read Roosevelt's nomination on
the morrow in the stars.
Governor Roosevelt will evidently be nominated in spite of himself and in spite of the admin
istration. He will have the nomination exactly as he desired it and just as he has had nearly every
political gift since he entered political life as a petted darling of. mugwumpery many years ago.
He did not want the nomination to come to him with New York taking the official initiative. This
is a matter the delegates outside of New York have been unable thoroughly to understand. They
could not appreciate why Governor Roosevelt should object to Plait's indorsement of him for : the
Vice Presidency and at the same time bertoiling with might- and main to get Hannahs indorse
ment, nor can they understand now why the measure of his caprice should be considered filled
by the "fake" indorsement. of Woodruff, which ill conceals the energy of the New Yorkfers in urg
ing delegates from other States to make Roosevelt the candidate. ;
But the Governor has carried his point and if he is nominated to-morrow it will be ap
parent that he has enough votes to put him on the ticket even though the New YorR and Penn
sylvania delegations should vote for some other candidate.
Senator Platt, too, has also won his point. He has cherished for many months a desire to
nominate the Governor for Vice President. He has said to everybody, including the Governor, that
the national ticket needed the strongest man for Vice President on it and that Roosevelt was the
man. He also said many times that he doubted whether Roosevelt could be elected Governor

stage to-day contained flaming bunches
of crimson ramblers, arid the chairman's
desk had a fresh bouquet of roses and
mignonettes. The long- session ahead,
witti perhaps a tedious, protracted con
test over the report of the committee on
credentials, heia no terrors for the asÂ»
Eembling thousands. The delightfully
cool and bracing weather was an assur
ance against discomfort.
Shortly after 11 o'clock the big munici
pal band of Philadelphia took its place in
the galleries opposite to the stage ajid a
few minutes later the strains of one of
Sousa's stirring marches crashed out. ,
Some members of the National Legisla
tive League of the woman suffragists
were busily engaged while the delegates
were assembling distributing appeals for
a declaration by the convention favorable
to woman suffrage.
As on yesterday, many of the leading
lights of the Republican party came in
without causing a flurry. The first dem
onstration occurred when Senator Hanna
entered. He could hardly make his way
to the platform owing to the pressure of
the delegates to greet him a3 he passed
through the pit.
Senator Foraker, handsome and debon
air, aroused the next outburst. Governor
Foster M. Voorhees of New Jersey, who ar- '
rived this morning from Europe, was
warmly greeted. He was escorted to the
platform by Senator Sewell.
At 12 o'clock, after Senator Hanr.a had
reached the platform, the ushers carried
into the pit the great bunches of red,
white and bine pampas plumes. They
looked like the same plumes which. were
in evidence at St. L>ouis four years ago
and they probably were destined to per
form a similar function In the great Mc-
Kinley demonstration later in the day.

"Our Chauncey"' was not overlooked to

wearing his-Rough Rider hat, he appeared
as on yesterday at the main entrance and
Instantly the crowds cheered frantically.
As on yesterday, as he pushed his way
towardhis seat his progress was impeded
by the enthusiastic greeting of the dele
gates. Senator Platt was by his side. The
Governor did not appear so Bternly
auatere as on yesterday. He smiled right
and lpft to the plaudits of the multitude.
While the Rooaevelt demonstration was
in progress the eyes of the mutitude were
| suddenly directed by a strange spectacle
in the center of the stage, as the Chi
nese Minister, Mr. Wu Ting Fang, re
splendent in rich Oriental silks and ac
companied by Mr. Chung, Secretary of
Legation, also richly robrrl in Filks. came
down the middle aisle of the platform.
Minister Wu was greeted at the entrance
by Senator Burrows, who Introduced him
to several distinguished public men crowd
ing about. Ex-Postmaster General- Gary
cf Maryland, a close friend of Mr. Wu,
offered the .Minister his arm, and. the
two proceeded out toward the delegates.
The Minister smiled benignly and ac
knowledged in'Knglish the many.saluta
tions. General Gary seated the Minister
and his entourage Immediately -alongside
the delegates.
' "Not a word from China," said Minis

ings with prayer. Few of the delegates
arose. While the invocation was ascend
ing a couple of snapshots of the conven
tion were taken.' Rev. Mr. Boswell said:
Our heavenly father, we come to thee as the
creator of men and the upholder of govern
ments. Ojt fathers trusted In thee and 'were
helped and where they led may we gladly and
boldly follow. We thank thee for the land In
which we live, for Its beloved ruler, the,pros

Pioneer Republicans Greeted.
A remarkable tribute to the flag and to
the pioneers of the Republican party now
occurred. -Mr. Wolcott stepped forward
and -stated- that fifteen survivors of the
first Republican -Convention called at
Plttsburg forty-four years agb were pres
ent with the same old flag used at the
convention. *
At that moment a file of white haired

The result was that his policies were in ruin,
legislation was at a standstill and public affairs

Party responsibilities had vanished, . and wUh

by the country at home and abroad. It was an
interesting but by no means singular display
of Democratic unfltness for the P ra S"cal â¢Â£*
Of government. To the political student it was
instructive; to the country it was extremely
painful; to business disastrous.
We replaced this political chaos with a Presi
dent in thorough accord with his party and the
machinery of government began again to move
smoothly and effectively. Thus we kept at
once our promise of better and more efficient
administration. In four months after the m
auKuratlon of President McKinley we had

Promise Absolutely Fulfilled.
Never wae a policy more fully 3u Â»i 1^ b ZjÂ£$
works never was a promise made by any party
more absolutely fulfilled. â¢
Dominant among the issues of four >â¢â¢" "K.Â°
was that rf our monetary and nnaneta sys
tem. Tne Republican party promised to uphoH
our credit, to protect cur currency from reso
lution and to maintain the cold standard. V e
have etne so. We have done â¢ re :. In " e ti ? a s v ,Â«
been be't?r than our promise. Falling to se

cial ixiUni, improving our banking Â»Â¦*Â«.Â»Â»Â«
tresaiDj our credit and refunding the public
debt at 2 per cent interest, the lowest rate in
the world. It was a great work well done.
The only argument the Democrats can advance
to-day Jn thW own behalf on the money ques
tion is ti-at a Republican Senate. In the event
of Democ-ati^ success, would not permit tlie
repeal of a Republican law. Thia Is a previous
argument looked at with considerate e>va
and quits vorthy of the Intellects **"<*Â£Â«>
duced It. Apply it generally. Lpon this theory
because we have defeated the soldiers of Spain
and sunk her ships we can with safety dispense
with tlie army and the navy, which did the
work Take another example: There has been
a lire in a Â«creat city: it has been checked and
extinguished: therefore let us abolish the fire
department anrt cease to Insure our hopes, uis
trust tn our currency, the dread of change,
the deadly fear of a debased standard, were
raging four years ago and business lay pros
trate before them. Republican supremacy and
Republican legislation have extlngruished^tbe
fires oÂ£ debt and fear, and business has arisen
triumphant from the ashes. Therefore abol
ish your fire department; turn out the Re
publicans and put In power the incendiaries
who lighted the flames, and trust what remains
of Republican control to avert freeh disaster.
The proposition is . its own refutation. The
supremacy of the party that has saved the
standard of sound money and guarded it by
law is as necessary for its security and for
the existence of honest wages and of business
confidence now as it was in 1S96. The moment
the Republican party passes from power and
the party of free sliver and fiat paper comes
in stable currency and the gold standard, the
standard of the civilized world, are in imminent
and deadly peril- Sound currency and a steady
standard of value are to-day eafe only in Re
publican- hands.
"War Crisis Squarely Met.
But there were still other questions in 1S3Â«.
We had already thwarted the efforts of .the
Cleveland administration to throw the Ha
waiian Islands back to their dethroned Queen
and to give England the foothold for her cables
in the group. We then said that we would
settle finally the Hawaiian question. We have
done so. -The traditional American policy has
been carried out. The flag of the Union floats
to>day over the cross roads of the Pacific. We
promised to deal with the Cuban question.
Again comes the reply, we have done so. Tha
long agrony of the island is over, Cuba is free.
But this great work brought with it events
and issues which no man had foreseen, for
which no party creed had provided a policy.
The crisis came, bringing war in its train. The
Republican President and the Republican party
met the new trial in the old spirit. We fought
the war with Spain. The result is history
known of all men. We have the perspective
now of only a short two years, and yet how
clear and bright the great facts stand out, like
mountain peaks against the sky. while the
gathering: darkness of a just oblivion is creep
ing fast over the low grounds where lie for
gotten the trivial and unimportant things, the
criticisms and the fault-findings which seemed
so huge when we still lingered among them.
Here they are, these great facts: A war of a
hundred days, with many victories and no de
feats, with no prisoners taken from us and
no advance stayed, with a triumphant outcome
startling In its completeness and in its I world
wide meanlnr. Was ever a war more justly
entered upon, more | successfully fousht, more
fully won, more thorough In Its reiults? Cuba
is free. Spain has been driven from the west
ern hemisphere. Fresh glory has come to our
arms and crowned our flag. It was the work of
the American people, but the Republican party
was their Instrument. Have we not the right*
to say that, here too, even as In the days of
Lincoln, we have fought A good fight; we have
kept the faith; we have finished the work?
War, however, is ever like the sword .of
Alexander. It cuts . the knots. It Is & great
solvent and brings many results not to be
foreseen. The world forces unchained In war
perform In hours the work of years of quiet.
Spain sued for peace. How was that peace
to be made? The answer to this great ques
tion had to be given by the President of the
United States. We were vlctorous-ln Cuba
in Porto Rico. In the Philippines.
Could Not Give TJp the Islands.
Should we give those Islands back to Spain?
Never, was the President's reply. Would any
American wish that he had answered other
wise? Should we hand them over to some other
power? Never, was aealn the answer. Would
our pride and self-respect as a nation have sub
mitted to any other reply? Should we turn the
islands, where we had destroyed all existing
sovereignty, loose upon the world to be a prey
to domestic anarchy and the helpless. spoil of
seme other nation? Again the Inevitable nega
ttve. Again the President answered as the na
tion he represented would have him answer. He
boldly took the islands, took them knowing well
the burden and responsibility, took them with
a deep sense of duty to ourselves 4nd others,
grulded by a Just foresight as to our future in
the. East and with an entire faith in the ability
of the American people to grapple with the new
task. When future conventions point to the
deeds by which the Republican party has made
history they will proclaim with special pride
that under a Republican administration the
war of 'S3 was fought and that the peace with
Spain was the work of William McKinley. So
much for the past. We are proud of it, but we
don't expect to live npen it, for the Republican
party is pre-eminently the party of action and
its march is ever forward.
We are not so made that we can be content
to retreat, or to mar. ttme. The traditions of
the early days of ovÂ»? party are sacred to us.
and are hostages given to the American people
that we will not be unworthy or the treat lead
ers who have gone. The deeds of yesterday art
in their turn a pledge and a proof of what we
promise we perform and that the people who
put faith. In our declarations In 1S36 were not
deceived and may slace the same trust in us
in 1900. But our pathway has ne\wr laid among
dead issues, nor have we won our victories and
made history by delving in political graveyards.
We are the part of .to-day, with cheerful yes
terdays and confident to-morrowa. The living
present Is ours, the present prosperity and act
ivity In business, of good waxes and quick pay
ments, of, labor employed and capital invested;
of sunshine in the market place and the stir of
abounding life in the workshop and on the
farm. It is with this that we have replaced the
depression, the doubts, the dull business, the
low wasru, the Idle labor, the frightened capi
tal, the dark clouds which overhung industry
and agriculture in 1SDG. This is what we woul 1
preserve, so far aa sound government and. wise
legislation can do. This is what we brought
to tea country, four. years ago.
New Promises Made.
.This Is what, we offer now. Again we prom
ise that the protective system snail be main
tained and that our great industrial interests
shall go on their way unshaken by the dire fear
of tariff agitation and of changing duties.
Again we declare that we will guard the na
tional credit, uphold a sound currency based
on gold and keep tha wages of the workingman
and the enterprise of the man of business free
from that most deadly ot all evllaâ a Suctuai
In? standard of value. The deflcit wau-n marti
this country in a time of profound peace a bor
rower of money to meet ita current expenses
has been replaced by abundant revenue, bring
ing a surplus, due alike to prosperity and to
wise legislation, so ample that we can no\Â»
safely promise a large reduction of taxation
without imperiling our credit, or risltins * re
sort to loans.
We are prepared to take steps to re%iva ar.d
build u*> our â¢ merchant marine and thus put
into American pockets the money paid for
carrying American freights. Out of the abun
dant resources, which our financial legislation
has brought us, we will build tiÂ» isthmian
canal, and lay the cables which will help to
turn the current of Eastern trade to the Golden
Gate. We are on good terms with all nattcr.o
and mean to reinair- so while we promise to In
sure our peace and safety by maintaining the
Monroe doctrine by ample coast defeyes aci
by building up a navy /Â¦which no one can cna:
lenge with impunity.
The new problems brought by the war wÂ«
face with confidence in ourselves and a still
deeper confidence in the American peop.c wnr>
will deal Justly and rightly with the islands
which have come into their chaxse. The outcry
against our new possessions U as empty as the
cant about militarism and â¢â¢imperialism,' and
is devoid of sense. and meaning. Regard for a
moment those who are loudest in shrieking that
the American people are about to enter upon
a career of oppression and that tha republic
is In dang-tr. Have U ey been la the. past the
guards of freedom? Is safety for liberty now
to be found most surely in the party whlcJi
was the defender of domestic Â»lavery? Is true
freedom to be secured by the ascendency of the
party which beneath our very eyes seeks to
establish through Infamous laws the despotic
rule of a small and unscrupulous band of
usurper* in Kentucky who trampled, not upon
the rights of the black men only, but of th3
whites, and which seeks to extend the same
system to North Carolina and Missouri? Has
it suddenly come to pass that the Democratic
party which to-day alma whenever it acquires
power to continue in office by crushing out hon
est elections and popular rule; has It lndet<i
cone to pass. I eay. that that party is the
chosen protector of liberty? If it were so
the outlook would be black Indeed. No. The
party of Lincoln may be best trusted now. as
in the rast. to be true even as he was true,
to the rights of man end to human freedom,
whether within tha borders of the Lntted States
or in the islands which have come beneath
our flas.

fomented by a self-seeking adventurer and
usurperer. The duty of the President was to
repress that rebellion, to see that the author
ity of the United State*, as rigtitful.y and
righteous in Manila as in Philadelphia, was
acknowledged and obeyed. That harsh and
painful duty President McKinley has performed
firmly and Justly, eager to resort to gentle
measures whenever possible, unyielding when
treachery and violence made force necessary.
Unlike the opponents of expansion we don"t
regard the soldiers of Otis. Lawton and Mac-
Arthur as "an enemy's camp." In our eyes
they are thÂ« soldiers of the United States: they
are our army and we believe in them and win
sustain them. Even now the Democrats are
planning, if they get control of the House, to
cut off appropriations for the army and thus
compel Kie withdrawal of our troops from the
Philippines.
The result would be to force tha retirement
of such soldiers as would remain In Manila
and their retreat would be the signal for th<*
massacre and plunder of the creat body of
peaceful Inhabitants of the islands who have

As they were carried into the p:t by the

at St. Louis four years ago. when similat

the immense throngs which bip.ckened the
vast amphitheater to-day were compe'Itd
to content themselves with, the routine
incidents connected with the permanent
organizationâ an oration by Henatoi
Lodge, the permanent chairman, and the
â¢ scene which attended the unanimous
adoption of the platform. Then they re
turned to the city to wait anoih?r twenty
four hours for the nominations which
they have traveled, some hundreds, some
thousands of mi'.es to witness.
It was a ereat disappointment to most
ct tlurn. The machinery of the conven

Sot off steam. There was not the slight
est jar. The wheels moved as noiselessly
ut a Corliss engine. The hand of Hanna
was at the helm. He is an experienced

convention scraped on a sandbar ovÂ»r a

Pennsylvania to cut down the represent*

Roosevelt's Popularity.
Again to-day Governor Roosevelt car- ' \
ried eff the honors. His entrance was
the firnal for the roost pronounced
demonstration of the session. It was as
dramatic as that of yesterday and was
practically a repetition of his experience
then. He t-till wore his Rough Rider hat.
Some of his austerity had departed.
With the relaxation of Sir. Hanna's opposi
tion, the Governor realized that he must
succumb. to the inevitable. And he ap
peared, resigned to his 'fate. Only once
did he seem to resent the popular accla
mation*. That was when Senator Wol
cott, who Is one of hie ardent supporters,
pave the crowd an opportunity to chper
him by namir.g him on the committee to
escort Henry Cabot Lodge, the permanent
chairman, to the platform. He made no
effort to conceal the annoyance he felt at
being thus dragged into view.
Senator Lodge, young, brilliant, already
famvus as a echolar. statesman an<i
historian, made a line figure as he de
livered his address as permanent chair
man. His finely poised head, * close
cropped Iron gray beard, delicately chisel
ed fealurea and slender, athletic frame
were clearly outlined as he faced the con
vention. His voice, though resonant, has
B down-East raspiness. but his delivery is
pleasing and forceful and his speech was
th* scholarly, clear-cut effort expected of
him. But it covered the Fame general
ground Senator Wolcott went over yes
terday, and though some of the fine points
elicited applause, as a whole it did not
stir up any great enthusiasm.
Neither did the reading of the platform,
a very strong document, by Senator Fair
banks, and for the same reason. Both Ir*
different forms were epitomes of the rec
ord of the administration upon which the
party will ask the country to return it to
powerâ a record eloquently placed before
the convention yesterday by Senator
Wolcott:
Republican Patriarchs Appear.
The moFt striking- incident of the day
was the appearance on the stage of fifteen
of the survivors *of the original convention
held in Locust street in this city in 1F58.
All the stirring; memories of the exciting
days when the country was on the verge
of the bloody conflict over slavery swelled
up as those old lovers of liberty faced a
new generation, bearing: in their hands
the faded, tattered flag of a generation
that, has passed Into history. Senator
Hati-Jey of Connecticut was the only one
of the fiftf-cn who mill holds a prominent
place upon the stage of the present. The
cheer that went up at the sight of them
shook the building. It arose again more
turoultuously when their Fpokesman an
nounced their unwavering allegiance to
thÂ»" party they had helped to bring forth.
Two hi5toric gavels, one from the tree
under which the immortal Garfield won
his star at the battle of Middle Creek,
Ky.; another made from the wood of the
old Capitol at Providence, R. I., and
adorned with bronze from the hull of the
America's cup defender Columbia, were
presented to the convention during the
day. To-morrow the convention meets at
11 a. m. and its labors probably will be
over before 3 p. m.
Vast Throng Attends.
It was almost 11 o'clock when the ad
vance guard of the preat army of visitors
crossed the Schuylklll and besieged the
doors of the convention hall. It was
thought the renomination of. President
McKinley was to be the event of the day,
and every road led to the Export Exposi
tion building. In street cars, carriages
finfl afoot the people streamed thither.
Through the thirty entrances to the hall
the populace flowed unceasingly, grndu
ally spreading over and blotting out the
great waste of unpainted pine'cnalrs.
As on yesterday, the delegates wero_

In the New York delegation to*-day " a
profile was noticed as an exact reproduc

of it proved it to belong to Senator
Cbauncey Depew, and that likeness to air.
Gladstone has been much remarked in
England. Senator Fpraker appeared on
the platform to make, an ipqulry, and it
was remarked that, since he was Gov
ernor, he has gained a few points in fig
ure, but It is certainly not for lack of
hard work that he Is on the increase, for
he is intensely laborious as Senator and
lawyer, and his correspondence Is enor
mous. His activities' know no intermis
sion. He still bears himself as a sol
dier and is as good a horseman as when
as the young Governor of Ohio he rode
with his staff through the streets of
Philadelphia, and had a triumphant ride
of it. Hfs Roman nose is still in evidence,
and especijftly when he rises to an oc

IVoIcott, was heard a* very few men in
the country could have been, but during
the preliminaries to-day It was evident'
that his voice has lost its mualc. The
management of the convention has been
conducted with propriety and not In a
rabble-rousing sensational spirit. Senator
Woloott had the opportunity in his great

Fairbanks has incidentally received a
compliment in an extraordinary way..; A !
Vice Presidential boom has been provided
for him and It did not start on the banks
of the Wabash, though it might with pro
priety have done so.
He has been opposed to this boom all
the time. He is weir satisfied with his

been that of the understanding that if the

results in regard to thd Vice Presidency
the tall Senator from I Indiana was held
in reserve and . could toe " called upon to
overcome the boom of any disagreeable

the singular choice of doing the hard work

its honors as an official.
. It was a spectacle of true harmony to
see that energetic Mayor of Philadelphia
sitting with ex-Governor Black of New
York on one side and Lou Payne on the

been of a pleasing nature.

The opponents of the Republican party
complain that the convention lrtcks en

of .the commonplace and not determine
to spoil the superb sentences of a speaker
by Injecting untimely and unnecessary
applause. The Republican delegates and
the : spectators, too, do not continually

long and' close association with Mr. Lin

Mr. Rosewater should' be called upon^for a

It was a dignified but pathetic picture
when the veterans of 185C were presented
on the platform, bearing- the little old
battle flags that adorned the Fremont
convention hall. They are not great flags
In their measurements, but they are rep
resentative of a great history. George H.
Earle, a citizen of Philadelphia, of a fam
ily that for two generations were famous
as anti-slavery agitators with a practical
turn of mind, was a delegate to the con
vention of 1856, and Is in good health and
of remarkable certainty of memory.. He
says of the first of the liberty. men, as
they were called in 1S40: "How little they
thought .that they were officiating, at the
birth, of" a party .; that was to abolish
slavery and to save the- American Union."

the extension of opportunities of education for

McKinley has been In
every situation the true American patriot and
upright statesman, clear In vision, strong in
Judgment, firm in action, always Inspiring and
desenVng the confidence of his countrymen.
In asking the American people to Indorse this
Republican record and to renew their commia
eion to the Republican party,^we remind them
of the fact that the menace fS their prosperlty
has always resided In Democratic principles,
and no less in the general Incapacity of the
Democratic partj' to conduct public affairs. The
prime essential of business prosperity is public
confidence In the good sense of the Government
and its ability to deal Intelligently with nil
new problems of administration and legisla
tion. That confidence the Democratic party has
nev er earned. It is hopelessly inadequate, and
the country's prosperity when Democratic suc
cess at the polls is announced halts and ceases
in mere anticipation of Democratic blunders
and failures. We renew our allegiance to the
principle of the gold standard, and declare* our
confidence in the wisdom of the legislation of
the Fifty-sixth Congress by which the parity
of all of our money and the stability of our cur
rency on a gold basis has been secured. "We
recognize that Interest rates are a potent factor
In production and business activity, and for the
purpose of further equalizing and of further
lowering the rates of Interest we "favor such
monetary legislation as will enable the varying
needs of the season and of all sections to be
properly met, in order that trade may be evenly
sustained, labor steadily employed and com
merce enlarged. The volume- of money in cir
culation was never so great per capita as it
is to-day. We declare our steadfast opposition
to the free and unlimited coinage of silver. No
necessity and propri-
measure to that end could be considered which
was without the support of the leading com
mercial countries of the world. However firmly
Republican legislation may seem. to have se
cured the country against the peril of base and
discredited currency, the election of a Demo
cratic President could not fall, to impair the
country's credit and to bring" once more Into
question the Intention of the.American people
to maintain upon the gold standard the parity
of their money circulation. The Democratic
party must be convinced thatf the American
people will never tolerate the ChlcaggÂ»platform.

REPORT ON RULES.
General Bingham of Pennsylvania was
recognized to present the. unanimous re
port of the committee on rules. He said
that In the main the rules of four and
eight years ago had been adopted, leav
ing it for the convention to make any
marked departure from the former pro
cedure. They are as follows:
L. E. Olsen of Minnesota presented a
table which had been used . at the Re.
publican National Conventions at Minne
apolis and St. Louis.
Senator Lodge received the presenta
tions with a graceful speech.
Mr. Lodge's voice showed splendid car
rying power. His reference to Hawaii
and the presence of representatives of
tnat new acquisition brought the -el
egates to their feet in a lusty greeting to
the Hawallans, and when he referred to
the "infamy" in Kentucky the delegates
yelled their approval. Mr. Lodge's- ref
erences to the policy of the Government
toward Cuba and the Philippines brought
out frequent manifestations of approval
and his brilliant tribute to the American
soldiers fighting in the tropics. was the
signal for a hearty demonstration. Sen
ator Lodge concluded at 1:37. l
Colonel Chiles of Rhode Island, in a
neat speech, presented -to Mr. Lodge a
historic gavel, the mahogany from the
capitol at Providence, the bronze from
the yacht Columbia, which defeated the
Shamrock at the International yacht races
last fall. A young delegate from Ken
tucky, John W. Langley, mounted the
platform and in an eloquent speech pre
sented another carved from a tree In the
valley of the Big Sandy beneath which
General Gariield Is said to have knelt in
prayer at the battle of Middle Creek. He
concluded with the statement that he pre
sented the gavel as a plcdpe of the con

that the State would this fall tf-p its

John L.ynch. a colored delegate from
Mississippi, stood on his chair and secured
recognition for a substitute to the Quay
amendment. This recited that In any State
where the right to vote was abridged be
cause of race, color or previous condition
of servitude the representation in Con
gress should be reduced in proportion to
the extent of the dlsenfranchlaement. A
point of order was promptly made that
the substitute was not germane and Chair
man Lodge sustained the point.
At this point the convention threatened
to get Into a parliamentary "tangle over
the adoption of the rules and proposed
amendments! Mr. Quay's motion finally
prevailed that rules 1 and 12. with his
amendments, go > over until to-morrow
after which the other rules were agreed to
without dissent.
Bitter Fight in Prospect.
To-night General Binghajn said that the
committee on rules would bring the reso
lution before the convention to-morrow
in amended form. It will provide Â»for a
reference of tho question of changing the
basis of representation to the national
committee, with instructions to take ac
tion upon It In accordance with the spirit
of the resolution. presented by Mr.. Quay.
The discussion will begin as. soon as the
convention' convenes. General- Blngrham
will have control of the resolution on tne
floor. lie sa*d he would offer an oppor
tunity ' for debate upon the proposition,
but that unless reasonable time for dis
cussion could be agrreed upon he would
move- the previous question. Upon, this
the debate, under the rules of the con
vention, would be limited to twenty min
utes on each side.
Tp-night the resolution is the principal
topic among the delegates. Those from
the Southern States are working like
beavers to stem the tide which seems to
be running- tqward the adoption of the
resolution. Sdme declare that its adop
tion means death to Republicanism in the
South.
Many of the delegations held Informal
caucuses to-night, in "which the resolution
was discussed with a view to action to
morrow. As a rule, however, no definite
decision was reached. Many from the
Northern States declare their intention of
supporting- the resolution. The proposi
tion has strong backing in the New Eng
land States, In New York and Pennsyl
vania, and In the Northwestern " States
So strong has the feeling become among
the Southern delegates that many of them
are prepared to trade their votes for the
Vice Presidency for ' votes against the
resolution. Indeed, this offer has been
openly made in a number of Instances.

don't mean that the Philippines shall come

Philippines solely on account of others. While
we regard the welfare of those people as a

Republican policy which would hold the Islands,
give them freedom and prosperity and enlarge
those great opportunities for ourselves and our

that the American people have neither the

rr\ HIS convention afforded no

JL comparison with political assem

The mere fact that such an extra

Vice Presidential nomination shows
that national politics this year will
be as lively as ever.
There will be no apathy by rea

of a national Jubilee and ratification

adopted, the Vice Presidential nomi
nation is exciting more than its usual
interest. And this is a healthy sign
and augurs well for the success of the
Republican party. The party througn
its representatives In this convention
assembled will nominate Mr. McKln

most eloquent tribute, "Well done,

at large, too. will select the Vice Pres

later at Washington Mr, Payne brought
forward his proposition. The committee,
however, decided that it had no authority
to take any action on the question. It
wis held that before the committee could
struct It to do so.
Text of Quay's Amendment.
Mr Payne dropped the matter at the
time so far as he personally was con
ceded but during the past ten days the
fire which had been smoldering burst
forth in the earnestness of the New Jer-
Eey delegation to take the question before
this convention. After General Binghum
had presented the report of the commit
?eT on rules former Senator Quay of
Pennsylvania arose and offered the fol
lowing resolution as an amendment to the
committee's report:
That hereafter each State shall be fnytled I to
four delegates at large and one additional dele
rate for each 10,000 votes or a majority, frac
tion thereof cast at the Presidential election for
Presidential electors and sir delesrates from
each organized Territory and the District of
Columbia and that the methods for the election
of euch delegates shall be provided for by the
National Committee. j^
The reading of the resolution was de
ceived with applause, particularly from
the New England, New York and Penn
sylvania delegates. Among the delegates
from the Southern States there was man
ifest uneasiness and It was evident in
stantly that if an effort were made to
adopt the resolution at once a lively scene
would be precipitated in the convention.
Audible objections were raised to prevent
consideration of the resolution and at the
suggestion of Mr. Quay, promptly sec
onded by General Blngham, it went over
until to-morrow. Chairman Lodge added
in response to a query that it would be
brought before the convention Immedi
ately after it assembled to-morrow: Sen
ator Quay sent to the clerk's desk the
following table: ' Â¦

from the way we have been button

HOTEL WALTON, PHILADEL
PHIA. June 20.â There Is to be a
" g-eneral muster "throughout the
country of tho elements that an
tagonize the Republican party.
The splendid success in peace and war of
the administration of * William McKlnley
has made a profound impression upon the
country and Is a chapter of history that
has come intimately to thV knowledge of
the civilized world.. It Is evident, not-
Withstanding, the strength of the admin
istration and the brilliancy and solidity
of the official record, that there is to be
a new test this summer of government
by the people and for tho people. The
test Is to be more directly made than
from the beginning | of our nationality,
whether public order and public credit
in the broadest and highest sense of the
words "order an\ credit". are to be main
tained at the polls without the lesson of
the misfortunes that the triumph of dis
order and repudiation would Inflict upon
the country. Wo shall no doubt in time
come around all right whatever happens
this year. The question is whether fur
ther experiments are to bo tried with the
bread and butter of the people, and
whether' the preservation of order Is to
be an accepted and proven function of
the government that finds its Inspiration
in the Declaration of Independence and its
consolidation in the ' constitution of the
United Spates. : Tho problem is the estab-,
lishment of the largest liberties and theh
identification with the preservation firmly
of the restraints upon anarchial and re
pudiating passions and inclination by the
consistent, thorough, judicial and deter
mined enforcement of the laws.
Will Support the Ticket.
The great organization, In national con
vention assembled ' in the city of Phila
delphia, must assert for itself tho highest
functions, and when the work Is done, the
turmoil of contentions over, all loyal Re
publicans will support with their utmost
ability. the ticket and the platform. The
public opinion of the country settled en
tirely before the convention was called
that the beet happening at the turn of
the century would "be to open the new
as. tho old was closed, with an adminis
tration by William McKlnJey.
The convention is on the sunrise side of
the continent, the splendid, historical,

proposition to reduce the representation
from the several States, giving one dele

There's something about the little
black dress that touches a man in a very
tender spot. He pats the little one on
the head, puts some pennies in her hand,
swallows nard and thenâ starts out to
make his own children fatherless. There
is no doubt that many a man is taken
from his family by* neglect of simple
precautions which would preserve his
health. Disease generally begins nowa-
days in w stomach trouble 1 * because the
meals are hasty and the food not di-
gested. From that beginning come dis-
orders of the blood, -liver, kidneys, heart
or nerves. The use of Dr. Pierce's
Golden Medical Discovery, for diseases
of the organs of digestion and nutrition
will avert the catastrophe of more seri-
ous disease. It strengthena the stomach,
purifies the blood, nourishes the nerves,
and builds men up in both brain and

ADVERTISEMENTS.
XXV - j ifanx wjjq v\\t * I St ysJ^^jt vj* T*j\I VIs possible that the admiral means him
self, at Taku, heard heavy firing in pro
gress at Tientsin, thirty miles distant,
though with an open river above him to
that point and gunboats capable of navi
gating the channel lying at Tientsin, it
would seem that he should harÂ£ oeen able
In that case to ascertain what the firing
meant in the two days that elapsed before
the date of the dispatch.
Naval officers generally bitterly regret
that Admiral Kempff was not in the fight
ing at Taku. . Up to the receipt of his
dispatch this afternoon they had continu
ed to hope, even in the face, of the for
eign reports to the contrary, that the
American naval forces had taken some
part In repelling the attack of the
Chinese forts. But the admiral's state
ment that the forts were captured by the
other foreign forces dismissed that hope.
Tho prevailing Idea among the naval of
ficers is that the reduction of these forts
was absolutely necessary to the safe
progress of any international relief ex
pedition to- Peking and â¢ that Admiral
Kempff should have found It to have been
within his duty in the protection of "al!
American, interests," to' have borne his
part In the burden. - Much depends, how
ever, on the exact terms of his instruc
tions, and in fact It is riot known definite
ly whether, or not he actually received ail
of his instructions. : The responsible of
ficials therefore are making no criticisms
of the admiral's conduct.
The administration- Is said to be *verv
much embarrassed because of- the, length
of time which necessarily will elapse be
fore the United States military reinforce
ments reach China. When General Mac-
Arthur at Manila received Instructions to
send a regiment of infantry to Taku with
all possible dispatch it was impossible. for
him to comply Immediately because of
raging storms. Had the order for the
troops been . issued when the troubles at
Peking were reported to be inevitable, r It
is more than likely that the troops in the
Philippines would have started before the
prevailing typhoon made. such a step im
possible and would now be on Chinese
soil. s Â¦
There Is every assurance that General
MacArthur executed his instructions as
promptly as possible, and ; that tho ; delay
in the departure of the troops was due en
tirely . r to conditions that could not ; have
been -anticipated or guarded against. ,*"-v
An evidence of the total unpreparedness
of the foreign colony In Peking for ' the

Alexejeff says the French warship Lion,
the British Algerine and the German gun

TRAINING SHIP BUFFALO

SOUTHAMPTON, June 2O.-Hurry or

the United States training ship Buffalo.
All leaves of absence have been canceled
and all hands have been ordered on board
to-night In order that the Buffalo will be
ready to sail to-morrow mornjng. Her of
ficers claim they do not know her destina
tion, but believe she is bound for China.
The Buffalo was scheduled to go to
Christisnia and thence to the United
States, but these orders are said to have
been revoked. It is claimed she has
about 700 men on board. The United
States cruiser Albany cannot leave for a
month, owing to lack of equipment.
An Associated Press dispatch from
Washington said that the Buffalo with 200
landsmen aboard has been ordered at onct
from Southampton to the Philippines.

CONVENTION ADJOURNS
"WASHINGTON, . June 20.â Assistant
Secretary Taylor to-day rendered a de
cision adverse to "the appeal of James
Fitzharris and Joseph Mullet from the
decision of the Immigration officials at
New York, who held them for deportation
on the ground that having been convicted
of felony In connection with the murder
of Lord Cavendish and Thomas Henry
Burke in Phoenix Park, imblln, in -18S2.
they cannot be permitted to land in this
country under our immigration laws. In
concluding his opinion on which the de
cision is based the Solicitor of the Treas
ury says:
â¢ "I uo not think the heinous crime In
which Fitzharris and Mullet participated
and for which they were found guilty can
be Justly dignified as a political offense
and therefore discriminated from the or
dinary crime of assassination and mur
der and I must advise you that after care
ful consideration of this case that my
opinion is: First, that the crime for
which Fitzharris and Mullet were con
victed and sentenced was murder In the
ordinary sense and cannot be classed -as
a political offense. Second, that Fitzhar
ris, having only a conditional pardon,
could not have been admitted even under
the acts of 1893 or 18S2. Third, that Mul
let even- if his pardon is full and uncon
ditional â¢ is excluded by the act of 1S91:
and. fourth, that the action of the board
of inspectors denying a landing to these
immigrants on the ground that they had
been convicted of felony should be sus
tained."
The men will be deported on vessela
sailing next Saturday.
Fitzharris and Mullet Will Be De
ported by Order of the Treas

â¢T ONDON, June 21. 3:20 a. m.â The re-
I ports of Admiral Seymour's arrival
I at Peking and of the safety cf the
I - foreign legations, originating from
Chinese sources and cabled to this
city frcm Shanghai, are still unverified.
However, the Italian Consul at Shanghai
b&s wired to the Italian Foreign Minister,
Marquis Visconti Venotta, that the lega
tions are safe.
The rebellion is spreading far and wide.
There is an impression in diplomatic cir
cles here and on the Continent that the
allies have not grappled with the situation
effectively and that even W,000 troops
would be powerless to <2o much to control
4.000,000 square miles.
The latest stcry sent out by the Shang
hai gossips is that Prince Tuan. president
cf the Tsung L! Tamcn. has burned the
Imperial palace at Peking and murdered
the Emneror and that the Empress Dowa
cer has committed suicide.
The effect of the bombardment of the
Taku forts, as described by the Shanghai
correspondents, was gory in the extreme,
nothing less than "rivers of blood" and
"mutilated corpses plied up inside the
forts."
The Russians guarding Tientsin, accord-
Ing to another report, fired artillery and
rifles June 15 at a. range of fifty yards into
the dense crowds of attacking Boxers and
killed 200. '.,
Japan, according to a dispatch to the
Daily Mall from Yokohama, intends to
land an expedition at Fuchau.
TRANSPORT THOMAS
IS STILL AT SEA
"WASHINGTON'. June 20.â The dispatch
from Shanghai last night to the effect
that the United States transport Thomas
with troops from Manila was diverted at
Nagasaki and had arrived at Taku with
1200 men is said by War Department of
liciaJs to be without foundation.
MISSIONARIES CARRIED
OFF BY THE CHINESE
The Thomas sailed from San Francisco
June 16 "and it is, of course, impossible
that she could have arrived at Nagasaki.
The Government is in a position to for-
Trard reinforcements to China from San
Francisco without the loss of much time,
as arrangements already have been com
pleted for the dispatch of two squadrons
of the Sixth Cavalry, numbering about 900
men, and a battalion of marines, num
bering 23) men. to Manila by the trans
port Grant, which is scheduled to sail
from San Francisco about the 1st prox.
The original Intention wa3 to send this
force to Manila for the relief of volun
teer troops to be brought home for dis
charge June SO next. In czse it ia desired
it will be a simple matter to change the
destination of the Grant from Manila to
Taku and by so doing place over 1900 well
drilled troops at the disposal of the of
ficer in command of the American forces
In China. The Grant is a fast ship and
can mako the run between San Francisco
and Taku in about thirty days. Such
assignment would have a double purpose.
It would augment the strength of the
American forces in China and at the same
time serve to render unnecessary a further
depletion of the garrisons in the Philip
pines, a course, which, it is said, would be
somewhat embarrassing to General Mac-
Arthur In the execution of his plans for
the preservation of order in the distant
Islands.
WASHINGTON. June 20.â The naval of
ficers take pome comfort from the report
of the French Consul x.t Shantung, trans
mitted by Consul Fowler, to the effect
that the missionaries at Tsar.g Chow were
carried off alive by the Chinese general.
The hope is entertained that the mission
aries were carried off to insure their pro
tection and evidence that the Chinese
troops at that point are not acting with
the Boxers. â¢ -
Owing to the vague character of the
French Consul's report, however. It may

fact that the date of the cablegram was

WASHINGTON, June 20.â The American
Minister at Toklo telegraphs that two

the State Department from Mr.Â» Conger,
in which he wrote from Peking April 6
that he had succeeded in obtaining per
mission from the Tsung Li Yamen to ad
mit free of duty the goods to be placed on
exhibition in the American warehouse in'
Shanghai, to be established by the Na
tional Association of Manufacturers.
Bond was to be given that none of the
goods would be sold.
Evidently the American Minister was
zealously devoting his attention to the in
troduction of American- wares in China
without apprehension of a reactionary
movement.

CHINESE GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBLE.
BERLIN, June 20.â "The responsibility of the Chinese Government for recent events," said a high official of the
Foreign Office, "Is now clearly proven. It has been ascertained that 10.000 Chinese troops, who deserted to the Boxers,
aid so under direct orders from the Chinese Government. Promotion to the highest positions of notorious anti-Euro
pean officials also points in the same direction. This is a war of Chfna against all foreigners, including Germany, and
the proper method now is to go ahead vigorously, quickly and resolutely,' no matter what the final outcome may be."
An inspired article in to-day's Kreuz Zeitung says: "Prompt and effective measures must be taken, even if the
volunteer corps from the regular army is sent out, as the present German forces are insufficient." 'Â¦'/.'!*;
The Berliner Tageblatt, which reliably reflects the view of political circles in Berlin, says: "A power which is
unable in time of peace to protect envoys accredited to it from its own has ceased to exist as a state. We do
not doubt that all Cabinets are^lnspired by determination to save what canbe saved."
The Government has ordered the German Consul at Chefu to establish service by sea between Chefu and
Taku Immediately. The gunboat Leichs. which arrived at Kiel yesterday destined for South America, has been ordered
to proceed to China and is hastily preparing to sail to-morrow. The new armored cruiser Fuerst Bismarck is under
orders to be ready to sail for China "within a week. The naval authorities In the shipyard at Kiel are showing extra
ordinary activity. An order has been Issued directing: that marines whose terms of service expire next month shall be
retained in the service. .Major General von-Hoepfer will command the battalions of marines sent to China,

Catching cold"<in the summer is a more
frequent occurrence than is most gen-
erally supposed. Winter Is generally sup-
posed to be the time for colds. But ccol
nights alternating with hot days, sudden
showers, following sultry heat, profuse
perspiration and coolinfr draughts, are all
peculiar to summer, which causes a mul-
titude of people to catch cold.

Summer colds require prompt treat-
ment. They are always grave and some-
times dangerous. The promptness and
surety nith which Peruna acts in
those cases has savad many lives. A
large dose of Peruna should be taken at
the first appearance of a cold in summer,
followed by small and oft repeated doses.
There is no qther remedy that medical
science can furnish so reliable and quick
in its action "as Pcruna. .

WHAT AILS CHINA?
READ in connection with Bishop Cranston's ad
vice that we break all treaties with China and
- carry Christianity to that people with fire and
sword, no matter at what cost in money and blood,
the remarks of Rev. Mr. Aiken are of interest. Mr.
Aiken is an American missionary who has been in
China for twenty years. He says that the insolence
and aggressions of- foreigners there have been
sufficient to develop the present feeling among
the people of North China. Among these
aggressions is- Germany's seizure of .Kiaochau
and the overbearing and cruel treatment of the
natives by the German officers. Mr. Aiken
thinks that if missionaries' had confined them
selves to missions, and diplomacy had treated China
decently and fairly, the Boxer movement would not
have arisen. Foreign intervention has now become
necessary, he thinks,* but it was preceded by a man
ner and amount of outside interference calculated to
provoke a proud, if ignorant, people to fury.
It is refreshing to read an admission that China has
some rights the world should respect. .'
Another missionary, and a Bishop, too.^the Right
Reverend S. C. Partridge, has expressed the opinion
that "Chinese diplomacy is rotten." If it is any more
rotten than the policy of treaty breaking and blood
shed advocated by Bishop Cranston we would like to
know why. Bishop Partridge says that Chinese dip
lomacy plays one power against another. If that be
wicked it is a sin not peculiar to Chinese diplomacy,
for it is the practice of all diplomacy. The Bishop
adds that the best friends of China want that empire
partitioned to make "a shake-up that will forever
wipe out the machinations of a selfish, gluttonous
mob of office-seekers, who enrich themselves at the
expense of every. Chinese living." Incidentally the
The Southern Pacific Company has at last made
a frank avowal of its principles and its policy. Ala
meda petitioners who complained against crowded
and unsanitary cars, delayed trains and frequent ac
cidents were informed that their petition would be
thrown in the wastebasket. The company resented
the petition as an attack upon its special privileges.
State Democrats are unnecessarily alarming them
selves over a possible illegality in the appointment of
their State Central Committee and a consequent
jeopardy to State candidates. The gentlemen should
cairn themselves with the reflection that there will be
nothing in the results of the next election to concern
them.
The victims of the "bumper" accident on the Mc-
Allister street railroad a few days ago are probably
cot aware that the Market Street Railway Company
uses bumpers solely to. injure passengers and save its
property. The presentation of such a fact in court
might result in an interesting award of damages.
City Attorney Franklin K. Lane has decided that
Sherman- avenue, which was seized by the Southern
Pacific Company, is a public thoroughfare. And still
Sullivan alley, with an existence of forty years as a
public street, is now private property. It is good to
be related to his Honor the Mayor.
The Supervisors are now discussing a proposition
to levy a tax on physicians and" lawyers." If this
unique municipal policy is continued to its logical
conclusion the board will soon be considering the
advisability of taxing people for living.
The Supervisors believe that the charier should b
arr.cnded, salaries pruned and something be done for
public improvements. This is- perhaps the only re
freshing instance in our new government of "reform
ers" seeking to reform themselves/
The police officer who was fined for reading a news
paper while on duty should have remembered that his
official superiors includc 7 some of the newspapers of
San Francisco in the category of thincs to be feared.

THE WEST A ND THE, STANDARD.
NO part of Senator Wolcott's speech at the open
ing of the Philadelphia convention is more
significant than that in which he set forth the
adherence of Western Republicans to the gold stan
dard. The Senator represents what has been known
as a "silver State"; he has himself been in the past
one of the strongest champions of bimetallism. It
is therefore a cheering sign of the change that has
tome over Colorado sentiment on the money question
that he unequivocally indorsed .the monetary policy
of the party and made no compromise with the silver
fanatics whatever.
After reviewing the contest between the parties on
the free coinage issue four. years ago, and describing
the effort made to obtain an international agreement
upon the subject, he said: "We have made advances
enough; this country can better afford than any other
to enter upon the contest for commercial, supremacy
with gold as its" standard, and for us the time has
come to give fair notice to the world that we, too,
wake gold our standard and redeem our obligations
in that metal. For twelve years the platforms of the
party have declared in favor of the use of gold and
silver, as money. Thclogic of recent events, together
with the attempt of the Democracy to drag down the
question from its international character, to associate
it with every vagary of Populism and socialism and to
drive this country to an alliance with Mexico and
China, as an exclusively silver-using country, has im
pelled our people to this settlement of the problem,
and the recent action of Congress has eliminated the
danger which its further agitation menaced."
That is the truth of the situation. "Free silver,"
even when given the high-sounding- name "bimetal
lism," is no longer an international question or, a ra
tional issue of any kind. It has become associated
with the vagaries of fiat money, unlimited greenbacks
and all other forms of financial delusion. The advo
cates of genuine bimetallism, like ;Wolcott, now per
ceive the . soundness of the' gold standard and will
make no further efforts to undo.it. Tlie only danger
now is that which emanates from the wild Bryanites,
who have learned nothing and can learn nothing
cither from 'facts- or from financial principles. Such
being the case, the number of so-called "silver Re
publicans" in this campaign will be few. Bryan will
find it more necessary than ever to carry New York.
His following in the West is less than it was fdur
years ago. The gold, standard, like the policy of pro
tection, has been tried and found'to be a safe basis of
prosperity, and- when Bryanism has been eliminated
from our politics, as it will be with this campaign;
there will be no longer opposition to it by a consid
erable number of people in any part of the Union.

THE COMMERCIAL MUSEUM.
T~) EFORE the whirl of politics occupies all the at
l^Xtention our merchants can give to affairs other
than their own business the movement for the
establishment of a commercial museum should be fully
organized and well advanced. At a conference of the
promoters of the enterprise on Tuesday it was stated
that the membership at that time was 157, but it was
decided not to organize until at Jeast 200 members
have been enrolled. The step to be taken now is
therefore that of increasing the membership to the
desired number.
It ought not to be difficult to obtain the increase of
membership. The enterprise is one of the most im
portant that has been undertaken since the construc
tion of the Valley Road. It promises vast benefits to
the city and to the coast, and the value of the promise
is guaranteed by the record of what has been accom
plished for Philadelphia and the East by the Com
mercial Museum in that city. The movement is not
in any sense an experimental project It is known
what such museums can do toward facilitating com
merce and obtaining larger markets for the product3
of our industry, and it is also known that in addition
to the institution at Philadelphia there is needed
another on this coast to aid in developing American
commerce with the countries of the Pacific Ocean.
Active and earnest committees are now engaged in
the task of. obtaining new members for the associa
tion, and they should receive cordial support on all
sides. When the committees meet next week it is to
be hoped the desired membership will have been ob
tained, so that the work of organization may be com
pleted at once. The enterprise is a large one indeed
and will cost much money, but it is none too large for
San Francisco, nor too costly for what it will be worth
to the community. Every important firm in the city
should assist the work, for each and all will share
in its benefits.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
HEROISM AND CHARITY.
p^IREMAX JOHN E. SWEENEY, in an act of
( heroic daring and self-sacrifice, gave up his life
* to rescue an old man from a burning building,
and every generous heart in San Francisco has
thrilled in response to the nobleness of the deed.
Now comes the second phase of the story. The hero
has left a widow and four young children well nigh
penniless. How far will that story thrill the gencr
i?4mrriMÂ» , , .,, , ,,--Â¦Â¦
cus hearts, and what .vill be the response."
There is no need here for argument nor appeal.
The duty of all who have been blessed with sufficient
prosperity to be able to show their generous feelings
by generous acts is apparent. The hero gave his life
in the performance of his duty to save an old man
threatened with death amid the flames of i burning
building. How much will the people give \< save
from destitution the loved ones whom the hero has
left behind?
The deed of heroism has been done. Now is the
time to do the deed of charity. Now is the time for
public approval to show what it is worth â how much
of earnestness there is in the praise that flows so
freely from the lips of all whenever a dangerous duty
is nobly performed.
SThe deed of valor which carried Fireman Sweeney
1 sublimely to death is not the only instance in
which he proved his readiness to risk his life in the
service of another. On a former occasion he showed
a fidelity to duty equal to that which has now co5t
him his life, and at nil limes he manifested the same
high courage. All honors are to him, and yet
no earthly honor can now reach him. That which
can be done by those who honor him is to assist in
raising a fund for the relief of his family. A sub
scription list has been opened at the business office
of The Call that all who desire to contribute may
readily do so. This, be it borne in mind, is a case
where charity appeals not to pity, but to admiration
2nd honor and love, and to all the faculties that are
responsive to heroic actions. Fireman Sweeney
would have . imperiled his life to rescue any man or
woman in this city who might have been exposed to
danger or death, and surely none who can afford to
give liberally to his widow and his children will hesi
tate to do so. . .

THE PRUNE-GROWERS' COMBINE.
AFTER months of struggles, doubts and hesita
tions, the directors of the Cured
Fruit Association have decided to go ahead
with the work, for which the organization was de
signed. They have not obtained'the co-operation of
90 per cent of the prune-growers of the State, as was
desired, but they have upward of 80 per cent, it is
said, and it is believed that percentage will be suffi
cient to enable them to achieve results so beneficial
to the growers and to the packers that those who have
held aloof this year will be glad to join the associa
tion next season..
In taking this action the directors have the cordial
support of the members of the association. On the
day when the directors and the packers were to con
sult and decide whether to proceed with the work
a large mass-meeting of growers was held in San
Jose, where the consultation took place. The senti
ment was. unanimously in favor of action. 'Resolu
tions were adopted declaring: "It is our very decided
judgment that the 'directors of' the California Cured
Fruit Association should now proceed to carry into
effect the purposes and plans of the organization. It
is our earnest desire that they should do so, and we
pledge them our hearty support and confidence in the
undertaking."
. With such backing from those most interested .in
the work the directors can well afford to undertake
the enterprise. They will control a sufficiently large
proportion of the whole crop of California to be able
to give packers and merchants who deal with them
much more security in business than can be obtained
by others from the outside growers. The chief diffi
culty in their way now is that of preparing on such
short notice to handle the immense crop of this sea
son, but that can be overcome by energy, and fortu
nately there are among the directors men who are ac
customed to" do business on a large scale, and with
whom energy is a habit.
The success of the movement, which seems now
well assured by the decision of Monday, will.be of
vast benefit to the State. It, will save one'of the most
important branches of our fruit industry from the
ruinous effects of ill-regulated competition* It will
help the practical fruit-grower, who lives on \ .his
orchard and derives "his sole income from his crops,
to withstand the depressing effect upon the industry
of the amateurs who maintain orchards largely as a
speculation and, having an income from other
sources, are willing to sell their fruit without waiting
to see what the rightful price should be; and it will
enable the. grower who has no facilities or opportu
nities to study the market to have the assistance of
skilled men in marketing his crop: Thus the advan
tages will be numerous, and even if so much be npt
achieved as might have been had 90 per cent of the
crop been pledged to the association early in the sea
son, still the results may be,expected to justify. the
confidence of those who have urged the directors to
go ahead with the work. Moreover, in this day and
generation co-operation is a force that increases, in
power as it goes forward. The enterprise of this year
will be in the nature of an experiment, but hereafter
we shall in all probability be able to count upon the
Cured . Fruit Association as one of the established
factors of the industrial and commercial life "of the
State. . Â«

Bishop adds- that "what is of particular interest to
Americans is knowledge of the vast business possibili
ties that await them in China. The prospect for
American commerce there should hold the minds of
our countrymen." Of course we are not going to
imitate the "mob of gluttonous office-seekers." - We
are going there out , of pure philanthropy \to let the
Chinese get rich off us!
It is evident that this Bishop thinks the best friends
of China, who want her partitioned, are the robber na
tions that want to get the slices. In the same sense
wolves are the best friends of the sheep; train-robbers
are the best' friends of the owners of the treasure-box,
and a horsethief plays Jonathan to the horse-owner's
David.
These two Bishops make a sorry spectacle of the
kind of Christianity that we seem to be exporting
to Asia in carload lots.
WHAT ANSWER?
THE Democratic State Convention rejoiced
over the election of Sillybilly Hearst to ths
presidency of a club, and indorsed the Democ
racy of his two papers. We desire that California
Democrats look over the following and say what they
think of their convention:
Take Porto Rico and nail the flag to the Philippines;
don't merely raise it. there, but nail It there.âExam
iner, July, 1S9S.'
We assert that the constitution follows the flag, and
we denounce the doctrine that an executive or a Con
gress, created and limited by the constitution, can exer
cise lawful authority .beyond that constitution. ! Believ
ing that a nation cannot long endure part republic and
part empire, we oppose wars of conquest and colonial
possession. â Democratic platform.
It is perhaps worth while to point out that "the simple
machinery of our popular ' domestic government will
neither be changed at home nor employed abroad should it
become necessary to administer outside dependencies. It
is in the power and right of Congress to devise any sort
of system that may apply to the conditions of such de
pendencies, and this power is in nowise limited by the
national constitution nor does its application Involve
any modification of our domestic system.â San Francisco
Examiner.
We condemn the Porto KIcan tariff recently enacted
by the present Republican Congress- as a bold and open
violation of the nation's organic law.
We are unalterably opposed to Imperialism In any
form.
We extend to the people of the South African repub
lics our sympathy in their heroic struggle to preserve
their national integrity "and to vindicate the immutable
principle that governments derive their just powers from
the consent of.the governed, and we therefore condemn
the present Republican administration for its unfriendly
attitude toward- those republics. â Democratic platform.
The dear old "landmarks.'* The picked "monarchical
hazards." The abominable "schemes of Imperialism."
These are the familiar commonplaces of the superior
person doing duty in the muddy vesture of pomposity;
but after all, calling: names, even names of many sylla
bles, is not argument. Let us examine the adjectives.
The most remarkable example In the history of the world
of the assumption of such hazards is furnished by Eng
land, and in faith England has prospered indifferently
well under all that load of "monarchical hazards." The
fact that England's institutions are as free and as dem
ocratic as our own; the fact that the EngUsh nation is
the most powerful and the most enlightened in the Old
World, despite its "schemes of Imperialism"; these facts
and others like them, do not appear to affect the
prophetic vision of the "superior person.' 1 â San Francisco
Examiner.
We congratulate the Democracy upon the selection
of W. R. Hearst to be president of the National Associa
tion of Democratic Clubs, and we heartily commend the
abla efforts of his two journals, the San Francisco Ex
aminer and the New York Journal, In advocating Demo
cratic principles.â Democratic platform.
Now we would like to know just what the Califor
nia Democracy thinks of itself. Sillybilly screeched
and screamed for taking Porto Rico and the Philip
pines and nailing the flag there by conquest. He.
scouted any constitutional limitation upon Congress
and the executive in governing these dependencies, by
any system best fitted to each. He denounced all
men who feared imperialism and quoted Great Brit
ain's example as one worthy of our imitation, and
boasted that her institutions are as free and demo
cratic as our own, and all this the Democratic conr
vention at Sacramento calls "able efforts in advocat
ing Democratic principles."
The Call offers its columns to any Democrat who
thinks he is able to- say just what the Democracy of
California thinks of itself for condemning in a Repub
lican administration just what it indorses as able ad
vocacy of Democratic principles in Sillybilly's news-
We doubt if there can be found in the history of
politics an equal case of contradiction, inconsistency
and folly; and again we ask. What does the Califor
nia Democracy think that it thinks of itself?

Report Submitted by the Grand Jury

SUISUN, June 20.â The Grand Jury of
Solano County has submitted Its report.
The total amount expended in the road

ness of the county to January 1, 1900, was
$2500, Interest $62 50, total $2562 50, which

session of the Legislature to secure such
laws and amendments to those at present
In force as will enable people of the

The latter kept up the run for a couple
of hours and was then lost to sight. The
Alpha will be seized if she enters any
United States port.
The Alpha carried Canadian goods and
passengers to Nome without paying a
cent - of > duty and . her breach of customs
laws is now notorious. She cleared for
St. Michaels, but never had any bona
flde intention of going to any place but
Nome. The revenue cutters Bear and Al
batross of the United States Behrlng sea
fleet were on the lookout for her, but the
former was frozen up in the ice. When
three days out _f rom Cape Nome on the
return trip the Alpha ran into the arms
of the Albatross, that vessel being only
two and a half miles away. The Alba
tross hoisted the signal' to heave to, but
the Alpha kept right* on.
The Alpha is a twelve-mile an hour boat
while the Albatross is ten on the booki
and it takes all tl}e wind out of her to
do nine. The Alpha edged away, and al
though other flags with orders written
in more virulent type were hoisted, she
still kept on and soon was out of reach
of the Albatross.
VANCOUVER, B. C. June 20.â The
steamer Alpha, which arrived here on
Sunday night, the first 'ot the Cape Nome
fleet, owes it only to good luck that she
was. not caught Â¦ by one of Uncle Sam's
revenue cutters.

thank you for the good Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done me.
It is the only medicine I have found
that helped, me. I doctored with one
of the best physicians in the city of
New York, but received no benefit. I
had been ailing for about sixteen yearÂ«,
was so weak and neryous that I could
hardly walk ; had continued pain in my
back and was troubled with leucorrhoea.
Menses were irregular and painful.
Words caflnot express the benefit I have
derived from the use of .your medicine.
I heartily recommend it to all suffering

say I have not felt so well for years as
I do at present. Before taking your
medicine a more miserable person you
never saw. I oould not eat or sleep,
and did not care to talk with any one.
Now I feel so well I cannot be grateful
enough to you for what you have done
for me." â Miss Edjta Fbedebick, Troy,

S"T JOSEPH'S PARISH
PLANNING AN OUTING
Officers and Committees Appointed to
Have Charge of Annual Picnic
at Shell Mound.
Preparations are being made by the
members of St. Joseph's Church Parish
for their annual picnic, to be held at Shell
Mound Park. July 28. Friendly rivalry ex
ists between the several parishes over
their annual outings, and the people of
St. Joseph's are making an effort this
year to get the best attractions and have
the most fun.
Yesterday there was . a meeting at St.
Joseph's Hall which was largely attended
and plans were laid for the coming event;
The' following officers and committees
were selected:
President, J. â¢'J. Dowlfngr: vice president O.

J. N. Turner, Bemoved by Governor
Gage in Absence of Charges,
Wins His Suit Against
Recorder Godchaux.
-. -
Notaries public are not subject to dis
missal at the pleasure of the Governor,
according to an opinion rendered by Su
perior Judge Seawell yesterday in the
case of J. N. Turner vs. Recorder God
chaux. Turner is onfe of the score or more
of notaries whose . appointments were
revoked by the Governor a few . months
ago, for no stated reason, but because It
was tinderstood. that his, predecessor In
office had done the Fame thing.
Turner sought legal advice after his dis
missal, and to make a test case acknowl
edged a deed executed by F. W. Kessling,
which Godchaux refused to record, on
the ground that it had not been legally
acknowledged. Turner â¢ instituted man
damus proceedings before Judge Seawell
to compel the Recorder to enter the in
strument, and the court ruled that God
chaux must do so.
I Judge Seawell held that under the sta
tute a notary public- is appointed for four
years from and after the date of his com
mission and may not be removed except
for cause. As Turner was appointed Sep
tember 4, 1893, his term of office does not
expire until September 4, 1900. Â¦ '
"I am" of the opinion," said the court,
"that the office of notary public to which
Turner was appointed was created by the
Legislature and not by the Governor; that
any statute delegating to the Governor
the power to create such an office would
be unconstitutional; that not having cre
ated the office the Go%-ernor has no power
to abolish It, or to remove the Incumbent
prior to the expiration of his term:
"The term of office of a notary: public
Is fixed and his duties fully defined by
the Political Code. He is required to give
an ofUcial bond In the sum of $5000. and
upon hi* death, resignation or removal,
"his records must be delivered â¢ to the
clerk of the county, who must deliver
them to the notary's successor when
qualified." â¢" : -
Judge Seawell Says They
Are Appointed for
Four Years.

Henry Atfstin Adams, the lecturer, in
terested and charmed another San Fran
cisco audience last night at St. Paul's
Hall. The speaker chose for his subject
the character and influence of Sir Thomas
More and it is needless to say that he
discussed his theme with that ability
which has marked his other addresses In
this city. The lecture was given in aid of
the building fund of St. Paul's Church
and the presence of hundreds of people
who crowded the hall was evidence that
the financial returns were substantial.
Rev. Father Connolly, the pastUr of St.
Paul's, is determined that a new church
shall grace the parish, and last night he
had the satisfaction of knowing that
many dollars had bÂ«en added to the fund.
Preliminary to the address of the even-
Ing the boys and girls of the pariah gave
several vocal selections ar.d well deserved
the applause they receive!. Mr. Adams
sought in his characterization of the
great English Catholic to draw for hi*
hearers lessons which they may apply to
the conduct of their daily lives. The
speaker pictured More in hi3 various as
pects as politician, statesman, lawyer and
citizen. More, he said, was a man of the
people, a splendid model for the Catholic
laymen, a man who suffered martyrdom
for the thought of duty that was in him
and left to humankind the superb exam
ple of a life well lived and a reward well
won in the consciousness of duty well
done. The lecture was eloquent through
out and won the tribute of frequent ap
plause.

MILWAUKEE. Wls.. June 20.â The ques
tion of the permanent organisation and
incorporation of the international mining
congress was discussed among the mem
bers at the session to-day and the general
feeling appears to be that the proposed
organization will be defeated.
Resolutions were introduced to-day by
Governor Prince providing for a call to
Congress to establish a bureau of mining:.
This is the first open move for the recog
nition of the mining industry, and it is
the nucleus for wide and extensive cam
paigning by mining men of the country to
secure a governmental bureau.
The resolution says: ,VThe magnitude
and importance of the mining industry,
which has now reached over $800,000,000
annual production, call for the establish
ment of a national department of mining,
the chief officer of which shall be a mem

Takagi says it is a plain case of viola
tion of the laws, as no Japanese immi
grant may legally be imprisoned. If ar
rested and detained bv the Immigrant
Inspector the steamship company bring
ing him must take the immigrant back
when illegally landed. He will lay the
evidence before Consul Hayashi at Ta

advisable to have the Japanese Minister
present the matter to the Secretary of
State at Washington. . Meanwhile he will
confer with Collector of Customs Heustis
at Port Puget Sound, with regard to the
conduct of Local Immigrant Inspector
Beach, who, it is claimed, for the past
few months has indiscriminately arrested
incoming Japanese and thrown them into
prison to await examination. The state
ment that immigrants cannot be Jailed is
liable to involve both the city and county,
which received the Japanese arrested.
Both now refuse to accept detained Immi

royal collections. Aa in many another
Instance, Invention has crowded art to the
wall and will probably keep her there un
til mankind awakens to the fact that a
truly beautiful thing which takes time to
fashion is quite as potent a factor of well
rounded civilization as* a device for sav
ing time. Then, and not till then, "when
we have leisure to be happy and strength
to be simple, we shall find art again."
Primitive devices for timekeeping, such
as the sun dial, the wick timekeepers of
the Chinese and Japanese, the candle lan
tern recorder of King Alfred the Great,
the clepsydrae, or/ water clocks, and the
rudimentary weight clocks, are interest-
Ing "merely as stages of clock progression,
although their simplicity of construction
has frequently proved fascinating to later
scientists. Sir Isaac Newton, for instance,
was proud to number a water clock
among his boyish inventions. All these
early contrivances were classed under the
general name of horologia, although many
seem to have been more properly plane
taria, recording the courses of other hea
venly bodies than the sun.
The word "clock" means, primarily, "a
bell," and it is not improbable that the
"orologla" of Dante and "abbey clock" of
Chaucer were but hand rung bells sound
ing the hour Indicated by sand glass or
sun dial.
Judged by modern standards the earliest
clock worthy of the name was made in the
fourteenth century by the monk. Light
foot. 1 Strangely enough, theae first clocks
were distinguished by a far more compli
cated mechanism than were those of a
few centuries later. They not only re
corded the flight of time, but were mar
ionette exhibitions whose little figures
acted popular allegories, the mysteries of
death, the nativity and adoration of the
Magi, and announced the hours by cock
crowlngs, descending doves and animal
processions, which disappeared simultan
eously upon the stroke of the hour bell.
The famous clocks of Strasburg cathe
dral, with the frequently described suc
cession of apostles and minor figures, are
the most noteworthy Instances of horo-
Iogical automata and are too well known
to need special comment. Their counter
parts on a less elaborate scale were set up
at Parish Caen and Padua.
FAMOUS CLOCK AT ROUEN,
Mary Steps, Exeter. Above the dial 13
an alcove, in which are three figures-
Henry VIII, seated and nodding his head
at every stroke of the hour, while the sol
diers on either side of him stnke the quar
ter hours by alternating . blows on the
bells beneath their feet. Among the Exon
ians these figures are called "Matthew
the miller and his two sons." The punc
tuality of Matthew the miller, ao endeared
him to his neighbors that they substituted
his name for the one naturally suggested
by the easily recognlied lineaments of
Bluff King Hal. So regularly did this
miller go Â¦ for and .return with his grist
that his townspeople told the time of day
by his proverbial promptness, and thus
gratefully Immortalized It in the follow
ing quatrain: '
Matthew the miller's alive
Matthew the miller is dead.
For every hour In Westgate Tower
Matthew nods his head.
After the more compact motor succeed
ed the weights depending from chains
or cords, * portable timekeepers, called
watches, became the fashion. The origin
of the word "watch" 1 is Involved in some
obscurity, but Ir supposed to have been
remotely derived from the Saxon "woec
ca," "to wake." Until more than a cen
tury after the main 'spring was invented
these first watches were too heavy for
pocket use. and were generally known as
table clocks, the terms clock-watches, or
oioges and table-clocks being used . inter
changeably.
v It, was but natural that the extravag
ance and display which stamped the Eliz-'
abethan age should have extended also to
tho newly Invented timekeeping novelties.
The fad of the hour, they were in great
demand among the lords of fashion, and
fortunate indeed was .the courtier who
could ' placate her Majesty's " ever- rising
wTath with one of these costly toys from
France, or. Btem the tide ; of her low Â¦ In

Memento Mori watches In the form of a
Latin cross Â¦were also frequently stationed
upon a praying desk, the less clumsy ones
being attached to the person and known,
as pectoral cross watches. These cruci
form watches were generally incased in
rock crystal, the dials beautifully en
graved with scenes from tÂ»? life and pas
sion of Christ. Those in the form of a
Maltese cross, also of French origin, were
probably much earlier and rarer than the
one represented, which was usually heavy
and so contrived as to have not less than
ten hinged covers.

their Ingenuity in order to make time

famous of these death's-head watches was
given by Mary Queen of Scots to one of
her maids of honor, Mary Seaton. one "of

HONOLULU, June 13.-To-morrow will
be the greatest day Honolulu has had
since August' 12, 1S98, and the' ball in the
evening will be the grandest since the
Wiltze reception In 1S93. The spirit among
foreign and native" people now is to Join
together in the celebration and the prob
abilities are that the day will mark the
time when most of the old score will be
wiped out. " â¢_
The programme will begin at 10 o'clock
at the platform in front .of the execu
tive building. At this time the First Reg
iment, Nj G. H.,- and a detail from Camp
McKinley will be drawn up in front.
Seated with the Governor will be the
members of the retiring Cabinet, new
.officials and Justices of the Supreme
Court. On the platforms at either hand
will be other government and consular
officials and special guests.
As soon as the inauguration ceremonies
are over there will be a military review
by the new Governor.
Edmund P. Dole, Attorney General for
the Territory of Hawaii.
Arthur M. Brown, High Sheriff of the
Territory of Hawaii.
Fred J. Lowrey, Treasurer.
J. A. McCandless, Superintendent of
Public "Works. .
A. T. Atkinson, Superintendent Public
Instruction.
These appointments by Governor Dole
were announced in his speech to the po
lice this morning by the retiring Attor
ney .General, "the Secretary of the Ter
ritory," H. E. Cooper.
President Dole stated this afternoon
that he would probably not be able to
announce all his appointments at the
time of his own Inauguration to-morrow.
He hopes that during to-morrow some of
the names may be given out.
A meeting of the Cabinet is being held
this afternoon at which the matter is be
ing further discussed. As there is a great
deal of business to be disposed of before
the republic ce"ases to be another session
will probably be held to-night.'
,W. F. Frear, who becomes Chief Jus
tice, and A. Perry, who is appointed first
associate, are both too well known to
need introduction. The former has been
on the Supreme bench since 1833. Judge
Perry was Police Judge in ' 1S95, whence
he advanced to the Circuit bench. Judge
Hardy of Kauai and Judge Kalua of
Maul are continued in their respective
offices.
C. A. Galbralth of Hilo, the new Asso
ciate-Justice, is forty years of age, having
been born in Bartholomew county, Indi
ana, in I860. He is a graduate of the Uni
versity of Michigan, and while there was
a classmate of J. A. Magoon of Honolulu.
In 1884 he was admitted to practice law
in Texas. Between the years 1889 and 1Â»9S
he was in Oklahoma, and served four
years as Attorney General of that Terri
tory. To the islands he brought some of
the best letters from the Supreme Court
and other Oklahoma officials, nle was ad
mitted to practice law here in April, 189k.
A. S. Humphreys, who. becomes a Cir
cuit Judge ot the First Circuit, was born
ut Columbus, Miss... January 16. 1868, and
is therefore 32 years of age. He gradu
ated at Columbus University and January
3, 1SS9. was admitted to practice law be
fore the Supreme Court of Mississippi. In
1890 he was admitted to the bar of the
Unlua States. August 7 of the same year
he was admitted to the bar of Arizona.
He was Assistant Attorney General and
special judge in that Territory. He was
admitted in September, 1835, to practice
law in Hawaii.
K.euben Daniel Silliman.the other local
Circuit Judge, is 2S years of age, and wo3
born at Hudson. Wls. He graduated from
Michigan University, and in 1893 was ad
mittta to practice law in- the courts in
Minnesota, There he remained thr^e
years and was admitted in February, 183S,
to practice law in Hawaii. He was first
a partner with J. A. Magoon.- but subse
quentlv opened an -office of his own."
William Seabrnok Edings came here In
1S91 from Washington, where he had been
practicing law "seven years. He was born
at Charleston, S. C, and is the son. of the
late Coh>nel Edings, staff officer of Gen
eral Beauregard, who was a personal
friend of Judge A. 8. Hartwell.
Colonel Gilbert Francis Little arrived
heie in the summer of 1895 from Seattle.
He had practiced a number- of years in
Indiana and Washington. Shortly after
being admitted to the Hawaiian bar Col
onel I ittle went to Hilo, where he has
since resided. Colonel Little will be Judge
of the Fourth Circuit, which" is the we6t
side of Hawaii.
Judge Jacob Hardy has for many years
been a resident of Kauai. and Judge of
that circuit. He ia recognized as a learned
Jurist. .\ -.
The last day at the customs department
of the republic of Hawaii was a very
busy one. Among the officers the greatest
interest centered in the appointments of
officers to be . sworn in as Federal ' offi
cers to-morrow. After to-night Collector
General Stackable '"becomes, a United
States Federal officer, and he will swear
in the others of the bureau. Up to mid
night the. Hawaiian Custom-house will
remain open for business. On the stroke
of twelve it will cease to extpt and there
after Stackable's accountings will be with
Uncle Sam. -
Under the American system there will
be a good deal of difference in the way of
handling the business, both on the out
side and in the upstairs office. The out
side work will be greatly reduced in one
respect, as the Custom-house will | not
have to keep track of American yessela.
The boarding officers 1 will not have to go
out to meet and get papers of shipswlth
the American flag, and the elaborate sys
tem of- discharging,, them and'collgcting
duties from them will be '. unnecessary.
American vessels do by far : the greater
part of the business here, so that the
number of arrivals in which the Custom
house will be specially interested will be
cut down.
This week has been a very slow one for
arrivals of foreign vessels. The regular
mall steamers have brought slightly
larger cargoes- than usual, getting In
freight from the Orient that will be sub
ject to duty hereafter. - -
The outside work '.will 'be under George
Stratemeyer as superintendent, perform
ing about the same duties as he has had
while Port Surveyor, the port not having
been granted a Port Surveyor as a Wash
ington appointment. Collector Stackable
and the advisory officers from Washing
ton, with the Port; Surveyor, have been
busy for a day or two making plans for
the organization of the force: under the
new system. There â¢will be a lot of
changes and ; some â¢ of the officers may
have a howl to make about reduced sala
ries. The district inspector system goes
out and the force of ..discharging inspect
ors, as well as of guards, is to be reduced.
There will be ' twelve * inspectors, â¢ all ' of
the came rank." and twelve guards in the
new force. The salaries in both cases are
to be slightly in advance over the, present
pay. The Inspectors get ; $3 50 a day \ and
the guards 52 75. The inspectors have been
getting $100 a month -and Jfaevguards-JCO.

ATJSTTN, Tex., June 20.â Contrary to ex
pectation, the Democratic State Conven
tion, which. met here at noon to-day, did
not, adjourn to-night, nor have the dele
gates been named to the National Con
vention at Kansas City. Instead of trans
acting its business with promptness, the
convention was early thrown into an
antl-exparrsion fight which waged all
afternoon and to-night. The fight waa
precipitated by 'an effort on the part of
Congressman Bailey to have the conven
tion indorse his anti-expansion views. Mr.
Bailey's political opponents and those fa
voring Senator Chfl ton, his late opponent
for United States Senator, vigorously
fought such Indorsement, and as a result
the convention has been In a wrangle all
Mr. Bailey's opponents submitted a mi
nority report to the convention to-night,
favoring expansion as against anti-expan
sion, and the debate will In all probability
prolong the 'deliberations of the conven
tion over Thursday.
There are a number of aspirants for a
position on the Kansas City delegation,
and the slates that are beinpr made to
night may, give the anti-Bailey followers
less strength than they could otherwise
secure. A large majority of the conven
tion is opposed to imperialism.

BUTTE, Mont., June 20.â There will be
contesting delegations claiming admission
from Montana at the Democratic Na
tional Convention in Kansas City. The
convention was called to meet here at
noon. An hour befo're that time the State
Central Committee met to make arrange
ments. The chairman of the committee,
William Cockrill, is recognized as a Daly
man. The friends of. Senator .Clark on
the committee, including those, who held
proxies, were in the majority. Chairman
Cockrill refused to recognize the proxie&
and appointed in the places of the ab
sentees men known to be favorable to
Daly.
John S, M. Neill of Helena, a member
of the committee, took the floor and pro
posed to depose the chairman. The scene
in the room at this time was very wila.
A' number of Deputy Sheriffs under the
leadership, of Under Sheriff Murphy
pushed their way Into the room and.at
tempted to eject the Clark people.* For a
while it iooked like an incipient riot. The
Clark people stood their ground and final
ly withdrew, leaving the committee to at
tend to Its business. When this had been
done. Chairman Cockrill was deposed b>
the vote of the committee and Neill was
elected in his place. Meantime the dele
gates and hundreds of spectators bad as
sembled at the auditorium which Cockrill
had selected as the place of the meeting.
They found the doors barred and -the
place-in charge of a number of deputies
and policemen, acting under the direc
tion of the Daly people. After waiting
vainly for' an hour, they were Informed
that the convention would not be called
to order until 5 o'clock. Before that time
the State Central Committee had met,
with Its new chairman presiding, and had
selected the Grand Opera-house, as the
regular place. of meeting for the conven
tion. The convention was called to ordeÂ»
there shortly after 5 o'clock and the Hon.
E. C. Day, one of the men who voted for
Clark, made temporary chairman. He
made a | short speech, stating that this
was the first real Democratic convention
that he had seen In â¢ Montana for years.
After the appointment of the usual com
mittees, the convention- adjourned until 10
o'clock to-morrow. ' -
The Daly people, representing nine
countiesâ three of them regular and the
others contestedâ met in the auditorium
at the same hour. 6 o'clock. Admission
was by ticket. State Senator H. L. My
ers of- Ravalli, one of the Democratic
members who voted against Clark in the
Legislature, was made temporary chair
man. After the appointment of the usual
committees, the convention adjourned un
til 8 o'clock to-night.
The Daly Democratic convention this
evening elected Martin Maginnis, William
Cockrill. Governor Robert B. Smith, Paul
A. Fusz, W. S. Hartman and Dr. J. M.
Fox delegates to the national convention.
The platform denounces "In unmeas
ured terms the action of W. A. Clark of
Butte in corrupting the late legislature,
in assailing the integrity of the Supreme
Court and attempting to debauch the
people of the entire commonwealth as the
colossal crime of the century."
Senator Clark's resignation after the re
port of the Senate Committee and his ap.
polntment by the. acting Governor is de
nounced as a "disgrace to the State, a
shame to the American nation and an in*
suit to the Senate.",

MINNEAPOLIS, June 20.â The Demo
cratic State Convention to-day was one
of the largest and most harmonious held
by the party in this State for years.
Charles' A. Towne of Duluth. .Populist
candidate for Vice President, was given
the heartiest kind of an indorsement and
the delegates to Kansas City were In
structed to support him by their votes
and by every hcnorable means. On the
floor of the convention this resolution was
adopted without a dissenting vote.
The platform reaffirms its devotion to
the coining of free silver at "existing legal
ratio." On this plank there was some
dissension in committee, one or two mem
bers suggesting it might be better not to
have a financial plank. The resolutions
further declare against trusts and demand
that trust articles be placed upon the free
list; sympathy is expressed for the Boers;
the independence of Cuba Is demanded.
The resolutions demand the repeal of war
taxes; favor postal savings banks; favor
the income : tax: 'the > election of United
States Senators by direct vote of the peo
ple and the system of the initiative and
referendum. The present national admin
istration Is denounced. The convention
was warm in its allegiance to "William J.

DEMOCRATS OF
MONTANA HAVE
LIVELY TIMES
MANILA, June 2O.-General MacArthur
will to-morrow formally announce Presi
dent Mclvinley's order of amnesty. Buen
camino, Paterno and other prominent
Filipino leaders are generally pleased, as
they believe that under the amnesty they
can bring about the surrender of Aguin
aldo, who they declare la' ready and will
ing to consider the peace platform adopted
by the Filipino leaders, with a few in
significant exceptions.
Several meetings of the leaders were
held quietly in Manila last week. They
are encouraged by the progress they are
making with the natives and the authori
ties here. To-morrow an important meet
ing will be held, at which the American
decree will be read. It Is the consensus
of opinion of the foreigners, the better
class of the Filipinos and the Spaniards
that Aguinaldo will appear in Manila
shortly as a result of the decree And the
negotiations of Buencamlno.
Now that the rains have fairly begun
life in the country districts is a exeat and
prolonged hardship. - - . ,. .
Preparations are being made at Cavite
to move a majority of the marines to

quire them.
WASHINGTON, June 20.â A cable me*
sago from General MacArthur says the
transport Flintshire arrived at Manila to
day. ,Â¦ - -
PRESIDENT CONFIDENT
FILIPINOS WILL SUBMIT
WASHINGTON, June 2O.-Secretary
Root said to-night that the text of the
amnesty proclamation would be published
to-morrow In â¢ Manila - and' Washington
simultaneously. It will be Issued by Gen
eral MacArthur and Is done by direction
of the President. The proclamation gives
a free pardon to all Filipinos - who have
'participated In the rebellion against the
â¢United States, the only condition being,
that they take the oath of allegiance and
acknowledge the sovereignty of the United
States. It excludes no one, except. those
who have violated the Iaw3 of war. The
proclamation, the Secretary said,' will
speak for Itself and -will go Into effect Im
mediately. The timeÂ», considering the fa
cilities for communication in the islands,
for the acceptance of the amnesty pro
clamation by those still in rebellion is
limited, being only thirty ox* sixty days.
The proclamation is very brief and is
plain and simple, its terms not comprising
more than can be put on a single sheet of
typewriting.
The issuance of the amnesty proclama
tion will mark a distinct advance in the
progress of the arms of the United States
in the restoration of order in the Philip
pines. The situation has been steadily im
proving in those islands for some time
past and it Is thought that the time Is op
portune for pardon of all those Filipinos
who have borne arms against the*author
ity of the United States and have not used
their hostility as a mere cloak for the
commission of robbery, murder and other
crimes. It is confidently believed that the
result of the proclamation will be quite
a general submission by those Filipino
leaders who have not yet given in their
adhesion to the control of the islands by
the 1 United States. ,
The promulgation of amnesty has been
under consideration. for some months, and
the decision to issue it at this time was
reached only after advices from a number
of sources that the time was ripe and that
assurances had been received that it
would meet with a worthy response from
those to whom it was addressed.
It has been made known to the admin
istration that the influential classes
among the Filipinos were anxious for an
end of hostilities and for a resumption of
commerce free from the predatory ha
rassments of small bands of armed men.
The vigor of the pursuit of those bearing:
arms. It 'was likewise reported, had dis
heartened the Filipino soldiers still hold
ing Out and many of them were now will
ing to surrender their arms on assurances
of their personal safety. In addition, a
better understanding , of the purpose of
the United States toward them is no'w
known to prevail among the Filipinos an*
their hostility to American control has
abated in a great degrree. With the gen
eral acceptance of amnesty it 13 expected
our troops will not be kept in such cease
less activity and the pacification of the
islands will go forward more quietly and
more rapidly.

STUDIO FOOD
An Artist's Diet.
An artist living in a New York studio
writes regarding the advantage of a
proper selection of healthful food. She
says: "Some time ago a sister who had
been ill wrote me of the good she had
obtained from the use of Grape-Nuts
food two meals a day and that all the
family made great use of the food. She
recommended it very strongly to me.
"1 had up to that time supposed this
was a luxury and had not tried it, but
I sent for some and for quite a little
time depended largely on Grape-Nuts,
with a surprising result, I have largely
lost my taste for meat and am unusually
strong, walking a long distance daily,
which for some years has been almost
impossible.
"I live in a studio and have neither
time nor room to cook, . therefore the
Grape-Nuts, tbcing ready cooked, come
in as an- especial boon and I felt I must
thank you.:, Â¦
"The Postum Cereal Coffee I have
used a long time, and if that comes from
you it must come in for a share of
thanks also. Ada A. Brewster, 204 W.

The case of Mrs. Frances Gehricke,
charged with perjury, on complaint of De
Witt Spencer, which has been going on
in Judge Mogan's court for nearly two
months, shows signs of coming to a close.

Another Chance. Â¦'
"Deacon" Jones, the little darky who is
familiar to frequenters of the tenderloin,
was tried in Judge Fritz's court yester
day on a charge of 'carrying a, concealed
weapon. \ He was drunk Sunday :, night in
B'nal B'rith Hall and flourishing a re
volver. He claimed that he was trying to
sell the weapon to the bartender.
"Will you swear," asked the Judge, "if
I let you go, that you will never In your
life carry a deadly weapon again T"
The "deacon" held up his hand and took
the oath'. ' : â¢
A policeman remarked that the small
ex-prize' fighter had once taken a shot at
a man in Marshall's saloon . on Eddy
street, but the "deacon" vehemently de
nied It. -
"Well," said the Judge, "as you have,
taken the oath you can go."
Tke "deacon" Inclined his woolly cran

Holders Who Walked Out Tuesday
Will Besume Work on Their
Own Terms.
The trouble between the . twenty- three
molders, who . walked out of the Rlsdon
Iron Works last Tuesday because the em
ployers refused to advance their pay, is
ended and the men will go back to-day
and resume their old stations. There was
nothing bordering on a strike at the Ris
don Works. The trouble was simply that
twenty-three molders had asked for an
advance of wages from $3 25 to $3 50 per
da"y. alleging that the cost of living, in
cluding rent and other necessaries, had
increased within the last year, which bad
made former wages seem small.
The demand for an increase was condi
tionally refused' by Captain Taylor. On
this ' refusal the men put on their coats
and walked out. and in time reported the
matter to the Molders' Union, which bodj
held a consultation as to what was best
to be done. It was decided to appoint -a
committee to wait on' Captain Taylor and
try to adjust the difference. This was
done yesterday and Captain Taylor agreed
to make the concessions asked for, as he
deemed it only a small matter and as
the molders were all competent workmen
he wished to retain them, j

Sacramento, Oakland and Tanforan
Park "Will Be the Scenes of
Big Exhibitions.
The canine specialty clubs held their
adjourned meeting on Monday evening for
the purpose of receiving the final reports
of the clubs*purposing to hold bench
shows under the auspices of the American
Kennel Club rules and also to determine
the support that could be assured by each
individual club to the respective shows.
The clubs represented at the meeting
and the official delegates were as follows:
St. Bernard Club of. California, by the
secretary, Joseph L. Cutten; Pacific Bull
terrier Club, by the President. Philip Fay;
Pacific Fox-terrier Club by the secretary,
J. B. Martin; Pacific Mastiff Club, by the
secretary, J. P. Norman. The bench show
committee of the State Fair Association
wa,s represented by E. M." Simpson of Sac
ramento, and the San Francisco and San
Mateo Agricultural Association hy J. P.
Norman. The Oakland Kennel Club not
sending a representative, ' consideration of
its show was deferred. It was apparent
that inasmuch. as its application for mem
bership in the American Kennel Club had
not yet been forwarded it would be im
possible for the club to hold its show in
August, as at first contemplated. Mr.
Simpson reported that the show was an
assured fact. Mr." Cole, the well-known
Judge of Kansas City, had already been
engaged and the prospects were excellent.
The probability was that the number of
dogs entered would exceed 400, so that
the show would in that case count five
points toward a championship/ the same
as San Francisco. Over a hundred grey
hounds' had been promised, â¢ a Â¦:. record
breaking entry for America. * Iny support
of the Sacramento show the" assembled
specialty clubs were able to> guarantee
quite a large entry, the Bull-terrier. Club,
the Fox-terrier Club and the St. "Bernard
Club each promising to exceed forty-five
entries, and the Pacific Mastiff Club fol
lowing with twenty-five. This seemed to
meet Mr. Simpson s expectations and he
expressed himself as satisfied that the
show would be a success and an annual
feature of the State Fair. The bench
show-will be held*,in a large: canvas tent
connected with the .pavilion' and â¢ the $3
entry, fee will enable exhibitors to view
every, part of the fair without) extra
charge. The dates of. the show are Sep
tember e. 4," 5 and 6.
Mr. , Norman's 1 report of the Tanforan
show was equally satisfactory. Applica
tion to the American â¢ Kennel Club, for
membership : will be made this week and
the show will be held on September 26,. 27,
28 and 29. Negotiations have been under
taken with some of the most prominent
Eastern Judges. Liberal prizes wnl be of
fered and no expense will bo spared to
make the bench show one of the most at
tractive features of t;he annual exhibition.
A special building will be erected by the
association. .

Large Portion of Money Collected for
Work in Chinatown to Be Be
turned.
The Citizens' Relief Committee will be
able soon to declare a dividend. This was
developed at a meeting held yesterday
afternoon in the rooms of the San Fran
cisco Board . of Trade, where reports of
the several sub-committees were submit
ted. Walter Castle reported the cost of
sanitation; Andrew J. Carrigan made re
turns from the quarantine committee and
George- W. McNear reported for the com
missary committee.
It appears from these several reports
that the total expenditures for the work
in. Chinatown in connection with the flush
lng-of sewers, the care of indigent Chi
nese and the general sanitation operations
was $6500 approximately. The sum of
about $32,000 was collected for the work
by the Citizens* Relief Committee from
the merchants. There will be a repay
ment of between CO and 70 per cent as
the bills now stand.
The â¢ committee voted to turn over to
the Board of Health of the city the In
cinerator and to provide funds for oper
ating It for a time. The work is prac
tically closed, but the committee will re
main in existence until the 14th of July
to receive bills and to transact any other
inddentalobusiness.
CITIZENS COMMITTEE
HAS SURPLUS OF CASH
J. W. Bartholomew announced last
evening that he had instructed his attor
neys to file a complaint against R. P.
Merillion asking for $50,000 damages for
malicious prosecution.
Major Lonir explained that It was : a
common practice for the Government to
allow goods to remain stored In the fac
tory after they had been paid for until
called for, the Government not having
sufficient storeroom to take the goods afl
at once. In like manner he said . the
boxes due the Government were held by
the American Bex Company.
Judge Heacock dismissed the case with
out any comment.
"Yes, sir, that is the gist of the whole
matter," replied Major Long. i"The Gov
ernment has not been defrauded out of a
cent. Mr. Emmrich stated to me that
about $40 32 worth of goods had not yet
been supplied to the quartermaster's de
partment by the American Box Company,
but that they would be delivered when
ever called for.V Â¦
A summary end was put to a causeless
prosecution yesterday morning by. United
States Commissioner Meacock when he
dismissed the charges against J. W.
Bartholomew and Ernst Emmrlch, ac
cused of having conspired to defraud the
Government. The defense, represented by
Bert Schlesinger and H. C. McPike, did
not cross-examine any of the witnesses
for the prosecution with the exception
of R. P. Merilllon, the complainant, and
only a few questions were put to him
and those only for the purpose of draw-
Ing him on.
At the close of the testimony for the
prosecution the defense rested without
putting in any evidence and Judge.Hea
cock said that it appeared that the Gov
ernment had not been defrauded and that
the $22S which Merillion had laid so* much
stress upon had been expended for 'the
Government by Emmrich in pursuance of
the usage of the office for the last twenty
years, and that the vouchers for that
amount had been presented. â¢â¢
Major Oscar F. Long, quartermaster of
the United States army, produced the
books of his office and the vouchers for
the $228 57 expended by Emmrich for horse
medicine and other sundries in amounts
ranging from 15 cents up. The vouchers
showed $228 71â a few cents more than the
sum alleged by Merilllon to have been
divided among conspirators against the
treasury of Uncle Sam.
"Do I understand," asked Commissioner
Heacock. "that it was the custom where
there were a large number of tiny or
very small Items, that instead of making
out vouchers and bills for each a mem
orandum would be kept of those various
items, and they would be charged to some
other account, as in tnis case to boxes
from the American Box Company?".

THOMAS O'BRIEN
GETS JUDGMENT
AGAINST LEACH
Mint Superintendent Fails to Make
Answer to the Suit of the Pro
" Boer Agitatorâ Default . \
Entered.
Twenty-Five Thousand'Dol
lars Damages for False
Imprisonment.
Thomas B. O'Brien, one-time candidate
for Congress and a local espouser of the
Bo^r cause, has secured a Judgment for
$2:1,000 against Frank A. ' Leach. Superin
tendent of the Mint, through ths failure
of the letter to make answer.ln the Su
perior Court to a suit instituted against
him by O'Brien for false imprisonment.
The legal time for making answer to the
suit' expired on Monday, and on the fol
lowing morning Attorney Robert B._ Troy,
surprised at hearing nothing from the de
fendant.. went to Judge Murasky's court,
to which the case had been assigned and
hatl the default entered. Yesterday morn
ing he had the Judgment entered.
The judgment is the largest ever en
tered'in a damage suit in this city. Un
doubtedly Mr. . Leach will appeal tbe case,
but. unless he can nnd some error in the
pleadings and judgment upon which to
reopen the case the judgment must stand
ana he will, have to foot the bill.. When
he heard ; that the default-had been en
tered he asked Attorney Troy to have the
case reopened, but O'Brien would not con
sent to it, so the entering of the Judgment
followed. To-day Attorney Troy will get
out an execution and proceed to levy on
Mr. Leach's property.
The suit grew out of the arrest of
O'Brien for addressing a pro- Boer crowd
from the steps of the Mint on the even
ing of June 2, contrary to. the orders of
Superintendent Leach. According to Â¦ the
allegations of the complaint the arrest
was Instigated by Mr. Leach, who, after
O'Brien had suffered the humiliation of
arrest and imprisonment, refused to ap
pear In the Police Court and prosecute
him. Attorney Troy was retained lnvthe
case by the Transvaal committee, under
whose auspices O'Brien is alleged to have
spoken on the night of his arrest.
It Is understood that it "was through a
misunderstanding that Mr. Leach failed
to answer v to O Brien's complaint. He
had desired" that -United States District
Attorney Coombs appear for him, but Mr.
Coombs, it is said, was Inclined to con
sider the suit a private one, and for that
matter did not care to appear for Mr.
Leach.
The trial of Lucien Koch, charged with
Stealing a vase, weighing -200 pounds and
valued at $200, from the parlor of the Cali
fornia, Hotel, was terminated before Judge
I^awlor yesterday, and Attorney Reuf
moved for instructions to the Jury to dis
miss on the ground that there was a
fatal variance between the information on
which the charge was based and the proof
offered. .The Information alleged that the
vase belongs to the /Joseph Macdonough
estate, while the proof adduced was that
It belonged to the executors of the estate.
Judge Lawlor took the matter under ad
visement until to-day.

the Superior Court to recover $50,000 for
the death of his Bon, Charles S.. three
years and six months old, which occurred

ily in company with his mother and was
playing in the yard' under a balcony- in

a window in the rear of the house was
In bad condition, the sash being rotten
and the glass insecurely set , in. "When
the workmen in front of the house let fall
a heavy Iron beam the house was vio
lently shaken by the concussion, the com
plaint alleges, and a pane of glass fell out
of the rotten sash in the rear of the house,
striking baby Forsythe on thp head/ A
splinter of glass penetrated the. brain,
causing instant death. -Tv,
The complaint prays for Judgment on
the ground of criminal carelessness on the

/9r^\ AM 25 years old and for a great many years have suffered from
f" â Vn nervous dyspepsia. I would be afraid to say how many dollars
;} . I have spent for doctors' fees and medicines. Many women have
â¢^ I suffered as I have â never in good health, irritable, worrying at
sC*P everything and nothing, always in expectancy of trouble, and
%Â¦" no sympathy from ofliers because not understood. My life has
'&)'; been miserable. Xo doctor ever told me what really was the
Â¦jÂ£j " trouble, and most of them would dose me with poisonous drugs,
}\ that would afford only temporary relief. I always blamed my
" nerves as the source of trouble, whereas I now feel confident my
nervous system was only suffering because not supplied with
energy from healthy blood, and my blood was impure because my
food was not digested properly. Last March I began using
Electrozone, having been informed by a friend that it was a su-
perior remedy for stomach trouble. It gave me almost immediate relief and I
continued its use until I was entirely cured. I now enjoy perfect health, and
feel no flatulence, headache, nervousness, depression of spirits or palpitation of
the heart. I feel thankful that I am cured. No one who is troubled with
dyspepsia, should let a day pass before taking proper treatment. I recommend
Electroncne to every onej as I am confident if directions are followed it will ef-
fect a cure in every case. I cannot express how much misery I endured the
years I suffered from disordered stomach. I trust this letter may be the means
of directing many a sufferer to this unexcelled means of relief and cure. I hon-
[enly believe Electrozone is the most effective cure for any form of stomach
trouble. My husband is employed as a railroad engineer. I send you my
( photog?2ph to use as you see fit. You are welcome to publish this letter, but I
.prefer to have the street number omitted." Sincerely yours.
MRS. H. S. COLTON. Poplar St., Philadelphia, Pa.
Thousands of women to-day are suffering like Mrs. Colton has suffered, the
trouble being some form of stomach derangement. If your stomach causes-
distress, although it seems only a mild attack, you should not delay proper treat-
ment. Don't allow this affliction to gradually undermine your health and place
you in a condition to contract more or less diseases. Are you troubled with
any of the symptoms, such as sour stomach, heartburn, biliousness, sick head-
ache, irregularity of the bowels, a feeling of uneasiness, distress after eating,
t>oor appetite, palpitation of the heart, a trembling in the pit of stomach,
loss of flesh, restlessness, depression of spirits, mental and physical weakness a
Mcak and flabby condition of the muscles, a dry and hot burning skin,
vomiting or flatulence? If you are, take* a remedy that will cure you. ELEC-
riROZONE is the most effective remedy for all forms of stomach trouble. It
regulates the stomach and positively
cures quickly and permanently.
Although dyspepsia is a very common :
disease, it often baffles the physician. .J~~j Â« 7.;' x

nerve medicines and spring medicines. The real seat mischief is lost sight of
â the stomach is the organ to be looked after. If you have a mild or chronic

ADVlCiiTISEMENTS.COMEDIAN "JOE" HART
AND HIS "CRAZY LIGHT"
JOSEPH HART, at present appear
ing at the Orpheum, has blossomed
out as an Inventor. He has con
ceived, censtructed, perfected and
patented a novel- "finish" for the act In
which he Is appearing thlg week. He call3
it a "crazy light"; the stage electrician
calls it a nuisance; the public applauds it
and the management calls It a "hit." It
lasts just thirty seconds and has cost the
Inventor already over 21500.
Variety Is the life of vaudeville and.
among successful vaudeville performers,
original thought Is at a premium. â¢ The
general public, however, has little idea
of the work and expense Involved in pro
ducing some of the novel innovations
which the first-class artist is continually
adding, to his repertoire.
'Hart's "crazy lighi" is very much in
evidence while it lasts. -It Is produced by
a combination of electricity, cog wheels.
hinges and carefully j?rrund lenses. Hart's
act lasts over thirty minutes. The "crazy
light" dazzles and distorts for a brief
thirty seconds.!, It has the effect of intro
ducing Innumerable arm3. legs, feet and
heads Into the final dance by Hart and
his pretty wife. Carrio de Mar. It is the
finish of their act and it cost, as said be
fore, 51500 to make that "finish" exciting
enough to be one of the topics of the
town.
The finish of an act is Its most vital
part. A snappy ending will cover a mul
titude of sins and in enjoying the good
taste left by the finale the observer will
forget all about the previous situations
which may not, have suited him.
Hart has devoted time and money to his
"finishes," but has never perpetrated any
thin? quite so sensational as the "crazy"
ending of his present act.
During the first week of Hart's engage
ment he called In the services- of two game
roosters to accomplish a fitting finish.
This "finish" lasted even less than thirty
seconds. It was not Quite as expensive

C. "W. Moores. vice principal of the Han

regarding the tstablishment of playrooms

Supervisors Hear Petition From Resi
dents in Outlying Districts to
Take in County Line.
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Police and Streets met yesterday for the
purpose cf hearing arguments for and
against the board's contemplated action
to extend the pound limits to the county
line. A number of residents living out-
Eide of the present limits addressed the
committee and urged extension to the
county line.
Mrs. John Sautter told of the 200 chil
dren of the Monroe Primary School being
continually frightened by cows reaming
at large. She asked that the limits be
extended at least tp Onandaga avenue, if
not farther. The teachers were obliged
to take the children across the street in
croup* to protect them from the cattle.
At this point Attorney McEnerney, rep
resenting the dairy and cattle interests,
euggested that all objections might be
rettled if an ordinance were passed for-
Mddlng the straying of cattle on streets
that have been macadamized or graded
Â«-ven if they are outside the pound limits.
He advised a gradual extension of the
limits. ,,
C. Stader said that the only Tray to
abate the nuisance caused by cattle would
be to extend the poundkeeper's territorial
jurisdiction so it would embrace the whole
city. Â¦ Dr. E. N. Tcrello said that people
xrho live In the outlying districts could
not s-fford the expense of -improving the
Ftreets in front" of their property to come
within the provisions of the ordinance as
FUgprsted by McEnerney. Torello as
serted that the failure of the Supervisors
to grant proper protection to the outlying
district? was the cause of their fmali
population. The pound ordinance now in
existence, he held, was simply granting
special privileges to certain Industries.
If thlÂ» request to extend the limits to tne
county line was not frranted the people
in the outlying districts would endeavor
to get Justice from some other source, he
ealA.
"An much damage will result," said
Torello, "if yÂ° u f ail to extend the pound
limits as resulted from the bubonic
plague, which in my opinon never existed
in this city."
George U- Roundley. representing the
University Mound District, held that if
the roaming cf cattle in the city was ob
jectionable It was equally objectionable
in the outskirts. Miss M. Lester of Mount
Wrnon avenue spoke of the destruction
caufed hy the cows and of a persistent
persecution carri'd on by a dairy adjoin
ing her home.
The committee decided to visit the dis
trict affected next i-rlday at 3 p. m. be
fore making a recommendation to the
beard.

the local Board of Health and Dr. Kin
youn in spreading broadcast the false ru
mor that bubonic plague existed in San
Francisco. The resolutions hold the Dem
ocratic Board of Health, appointed by a
Democratic Mayor, responsible for the
great injury Inflicted on the State. The
Federal quarantine officer. Dr. Klnyoun,
Is severely censured for placing the quar
antine on California. Influential Repub
licans are commended for active and suc
cessful efforts to raise the quarantine.
The President of the United States 13
earnestly requested to remove Dr. Kin

mends the adoption of the resolutions by
the State Central Committee.
The Republicans of San Francisco will
assemble at the Pavilion this evening to
ratify the nomination of William McKIn
ley for President of the United States. It
is expected that the Vice Presidential
nomination will be made before the meet
ing is called to order, but delay at Phila
delphia in selecting the President's run
ning mate will not cause a postponement
of the meeting or diminish the enthus
iasm. Preparations have been made for
a grand rally of Republicans. â¢
The Knickerbocker quartet will sing, the
bands will play and the eloquent orators
of the grand old party will express senti
ments of American patriotism. No doubt
some of the orators will have the good,
hard eense to pause in flights of oratory
to adviee (every unregistered Republican
voter to go at once to the registration of
fice and register. The old registration
docs not hold good for the general elec
tion next November. In order to vote
every one must register anew. Since new
registration is required voters should en
roll in time to vote at the primary elec
tion August 14. _
Enrollment In the district Republican
clubs will begin next Saturday evening
and continue for one 'week. To-morrow
official notice will be given of the place
of enrollment In each Assembly district.
FIFTH DISTRICT COMMITTEE.
The Fifth Congressional District Repub
lican Committee, which was appointed by
J. Alva Watt in June, 1S99, Is making a
strenuous effort for a prolonged lease of
life. There has been filed in the Regis
trar's office a copy of a resolution adopted
by the late convention of the district. The
Secretary- of State Is in â¢ possession â¢ of- a
copy of the resolution and a copy of the
precious document Â¦ has also been trans
mitted to' the Republican State Central
Committee. When full returns are in from
other organizations evidence of additional
nllng may be produced. .
The preamble sets forth that the Fifth
Congressional District Republican nomin
ating convention at 1S98 adopted a resolu
tion authorizing and. empowering James
Alva Watt Â¦ to appoint - a Congressional
District '- committee. Xo proof has been
presented to the Secretary of State, the
Registrar of voters or any. other citizen
that the convention of. 1S98 delegated the
authority .mentioned in the- resolution.
There Is ample proof to establish the fact
that exercise of the authority was not at-

NEXT CONVENTION
OF REPUBLICANS
Delegates to Represent the "Party
Will-Be Chosen 1 at Primary ,
tempted until fourteen months after the
convention adjourned. The record Is clear
that the convention did not appoint a com
mittee. Minutes of the secretary and
newspaper accounts written at the tlmq
the convention adjourned make no refer
ence to the committee.
The document recently filed in the Reg
istrar's office is attested by O. A. Hale
to this extent. Mr. Hale, as chairman of
the Fifth Congressional District Conven
tion, Sacramento, May. 1SO0, signs a state
ment that the resolution was adopted.
The names of the commltteemen are given
as follows:
E. I. Robinson. Thirty-fourth Assembly
District; W. H. Cobb, Thirty-fifth Assem
bly District; Frank French, Thirty-sixth
Assembly District; G. 11. Fairchlld, Thir
ty-seventh Assembly District; Max Gold
berg, Â¦ Thirty-eighth Assembly District;
Jesse E. Marks, Fortieth Assembly Dis
trict; F. R. Danforth, Forty-first Assem
bly District; "Alvln" J. Hay ward. Fifty
second Assembly District; H. Donovan,
Fifty-fourth Assembly District; , Louis
O'Neill, Fifty-fifth Asembly District; G.
D. MacKenzie, Fifty-sixth Assembly Dis
trict.
The "Alvln" Hayward of the Fifty-sec
ond District is presumably Intended to
mean Alvlnza Hayward.
The resolution which was adopted at
the Sacramento convention continues the
foregoing committee in office.
Before the ougoing State Central Com
mittee met in this city to fix the time,
place and appointment of the late Repub
lican State Convention The Call directed
attention to the fact that the Fifth Dis
trict Congressional Convention of 1S3S ad
journed without appointing a committee.
When the subject came up in the State
Central Committee meeting J. Alva Watt
claimed that he appointed the committee
under authority derived from the district
convention of 189S. He assured the con
vention, however, that the committee had
no intention of appointing delegates to the
State convention, but on the contrary In
tended to call for primary elections. As
there was nothing at stake but the selec
tion of delegates to a State convention
called for the puropse of sending repre
sentatives to Philadelphia the assurance
given by Watt was accepted. In direct
violation of Watt's promise the commit
teemen. whose names are embraced in the
resolution filed In the Registrar's office,
met and APPOINTED delegates to the
State convention.
No apology for or explanation of this
breach of faith was given to the old State
Central Committee. The railroad agents
simply directed that primaries should not
be called and the committee obeyed. The
thought of placing any value on a prom
ise openly and solemnly given to the Re
publican State Central Committee never
entered Into the calculations of the com
mltteemen of the Fifth. ".;.-.â¢
The new State Central Committee,
which meets to-morrow, should consider
that there Is now a Representative in
Congress at stake. The fact should be
considered that the preceding State Cen
tral Committee was deceived by a false
statement emanating from the spokesman
cf this so-called Fifth District Congres
sional Committee. The further fact should
be considered that the Republican voters
of the Fifth District will not vote for a
candidate for Congress put forward by the
agents of the Southern Pacific.
The extraordinary activity displayed by
machine politicians in filing documents to
give life and character to a Congressional
committee of doubtful creation excites
suspicion. The new State Central Ccm
mittec should take no chances In dealing
with; Fifth District affairs. Positive proof
may yet be produced that Watt was never
authorized by the district convention of"
1S9S to appoint a Congressional commit
tee. It is important that the petitions
should be presented to the proper authori
ties by a legally constituted governing
body of the party in the district.

WANTS TO BE SENATOB AGAIN.
OAKLAND, June 20.â United States
Senator George C. Perkins will be a can
didate to succeed himself two years from
next' spring. It has generally been be
lieved that Senator Perkins desired to
succeed hmself, but it has never before
been officially announced. The Oakland
Tribune '= this evening â¢ publishes a letter
from Senator* Perkins under date of June
19, in which the Senator replies to "a
question whether he would be a candidate
or not. saying: â¢ .
"The election of my successor, as you
are aware, does not take place until two
years from next January, and many
changes will doubtless take place In the
meantime. However, your note of Inquiry
Is entitled to a frank answer. I. there
fore, beg to say if I can be re-elected as I
have been twice before electedâ that Is, by
the expressed or implied understanding of
the Republican nominees to the Legisla
ture that If elected they looked with favor
upon my election as being satisfactory to
their Immediate constituents, In other
words If I can go before the people at the
proper time and receive their support â I
expect to be a candidate to succeed my-
Belf. â¢ Otherwise, I am willing to step aside
and support some one who can perhaps
accomplish more for. our. State than 1 am
able to do.,'In any event. I owe a very
large debt of gratitude to the ; people of

FAT AX ACCIDENT ON UOTTED STATES TBANSPOBT GRANT.
Chaffer Family's Unhappy State.
The unhappy domestic relations of
Thomas Chaffer, a machinist, llvlni* at
313 Day street, were aired in Judge Fritzs
court yesterday afternoon, his wife Lot
tie having brousht a charge against him
of threats tokilL Mr?. Chaffer testified
that, though married 13 years, for the
past six weeks she and her husband had
been practically living apart and she
contemplated securing a divorce owing to
his cruelty. She state;l that he beat and
abused her and even tried to poison her
self and children. Mrs. Chaffer was cor
roborated by her daughter Lottie and her
son Nelson. Chaffer denied trying to
poison his wife and swore that she ha'l
struck him in the face and he had pro
tected himself by seizing her wrists. De
tective Graham, who Is a neighbor, tes
tified that the defendant was esteemed by
everybody in the neighborhood, but ad
mitted he did not know what >vÂ»nt on in
the house. Judge Fritz said he would re
serve his decision till to-day, but Inti
mated that he would place Chaffer under
bonds to keep the peace.
A FATAL accident, resulting in the
death of Mate John HUlman,
occurred on the transport Grant
yesterday 'meming. The ship had
been moved into the transport dock from
the stream and the work of hoisting
aboard the tender was going on when the
accident occurred. The Grant had an in
shore list and when the work cf swinging
the davits, in which hung the tender, was
begun, the men exercised extra care. Sec
ond Officer John Hillman warned the men
to-be careful, but hardly were the words
out of his mouth when the heavy launch
swung in toward the port side and
knocked the mate against one of the ven
tilators.
When picked up Mate Hillman was
bleeding from the ears, while a bloody
foam appeared on his lips. An emergency
call was sent to the Harbor Hospital and
in a few minutes the ambulance was
on hand. At the hospital Drs. Frank
Robirson and Will Bauer made a diag
nosis and came to the conclusion
that there was a fracture of the base of
the skull. Later Dr. Armisted also made
the primary grade certificate of Mrs.
Helen Troy Miller and the grammar
grrulÂ« certificate of Mi.-s B. M. Bretz,

poned until next week for further investi
gation by the board.
The following-named were recommends
to the State Board of Education tor 15f>
diplomas of the grammar grade: MiÂ«Â»a
Ru?!e Haas. Mrs. Anna S. Spreckela. Mi*3
Kathryn T. N'unan. Mlsa Christine M.
Stack and Miss Agnes Regan. For a nt^
issue of grammar grade /life diplomas L.
Bowman and Mrs. Belle Flaherty and for
an educational diploma of the grammar
grade Miss Edna Cadwalader were recom
mended.
The Board of Education yesterday de
cided to reorganize the physical culture
department in the public schools and as
a preliminary step toward that end dis
missed the three special teachers who
have had charge of the classes. Those
who lost their positions are H. C. F.
Stahl, George S. Miehling and Robert
Barth.
In the resolution providing for the dis
missals the board states that it "hopes
to reorganize the teaching of physical cul
ture by placing It in the department on
a sound physiological,' psychological and
pedagogical basis"; that the special corps
of three teachers is inadequate to give
Instruction often enough and that "the
present system of . gymnastic exercises
can be taught Just as effectively by class
teachers supervised by the principals."
It was resolved to request the City and
County Attorney to appeal from the 'de
cision adverse to the School Board in the
suit of R. H. Mitchell against P. A. Ber
gerot et al. ; â¢":
A communication was received from the
Public Improvement Central Club regard
ing the once proposed revision of the rules
that would increase the number of pupil3
in receiving classes to sixty-two and com
pel principals in certain schools to teach
a class. The club demanded that before
final action was taken In the mater the
board hold an open meeting for its dis
cussion bo the club could have a com
mittee present to represent it.
Before the secretary had read the com
munication through Denman objected to
further reading on the ground that the
board had decided not to carry out the
propositions mentioned. He Bald that it
was an insult to the members of the
board to accuse them of contemplating
doing something they had never intended
to do and the communication was shelved.
The fact remains, however, that the
propositions were seriously discussed at
the secret meetings of the board but were
abandoned owing to the opposition cre
ated among teachers and parents against
the schemes when publicity was given
them.,
It was resolved that the board, in ac
cordance with section 1791, subdivision III,
of the Political Code of the State of Cal
ifornia, authorized the issuance of special
certificates in the following subjects:
Bookkeeping, cookery, sewlngr, domestic
science (cookery and sewing combined),
mechanical drawing, architectural draw
ing 1 , freehand drawing; freehand drawing
and clay modeling (correlative and com
bined), freehand drawing and wood carv
ing (correlative and combined), sloyd,
ironwork, woodwork, elocution. Italian,
French, German, Spanish, Latin. Greek,
physical culture, penmanship, stenography
and typewriting (combined), music, kin
dergarten work and manual training, in
cluding as many of the subjects from five
to twelve Inclusive as might be indorsed
on the certificate of the applicant upon
legal proof of competency to teach them.
The city board of examination was di
rected to recommend and present to the
Board of Education such persons as they
might, under the law. find properly qual
ified to receive special certificates for the
subjects named.
Authorization was given to make neces
sary repairs to the Lafayette School
building; to lay stone coping in front of

CHICAGO, June 20.â Drought has ruined half
the crcp of wheat of the fruitful Northwest
and now excessive heat, according to to-day's
dispatches, is burning up the remainder. A
message from the unfortunate part of the coun
try said that the temperature was 100 degrees
In places. If any additional stimulus were
needed to cause the .continuance of general and
heavy buying of wheat it was found In the
news mentioned. The market started the ses
sion with a good advance over yesterday and
kept on advancing to the close. Throughout
the day Northwestern crops were gloomy to an
extreme degree. The loss now will be nearly
fit per cent. July opened IVi'S'lHc ov-;r yester
day at 78%@79Vic. and after a dip to 78?ic near
the opening, advanced slowly but surely to
8l%c. at which It closed, a price 3%c over yes
terday. The ' Northwest was a heavy buyer,
but at that it could not be said to have led the
dfmand. The demand came from everywhere
apparently; 100.000-bushel lots offered by for
tunate possessors for profit were gobbled up
like a peck of potatoes and the statisticians on
the beard nearly lost their wits trying to keep
track of a market which had gotten far out
of ordinary ' bounds. Outside markets advanc
ed, those In the ' Northwest shooting up even
faster than Chicago, thus furnishing to the
local people additional impulse. The cash
business was curtailed by the sky-rocketing. of
futures. The dips during the day were incon
sequential generally. During the forenoon, July
having jumped to 79?4c, Bold off to 7S%c under
liquidation by longs, but following Uiat the
dips were too small to be noticeable. In such a
large market. The .total of to-day'B trading*
was estimated at 30.000,000 bushels.
Good general buying of corn resulted from
the wheat strength, that market ruling strong
through the session. Vluly closed at the top,
l%c over yesterday. â¢
Oats were active and strong, helped by the
advance in wheat. July gained lc over yester
day. -
Provisions speculators were calm In the
midst of the surrounding excltementj but were
in accord with the general improvements suf
ficiently to advance the market a bit. July pork
closed "Vic up and lard and ribs each gained 5c.

Condition of Trade.
Henry Clews' New Tcrk circular cays:
"One very satisfactory evidence of prosperity
Is the continued large exports, amounting to
IIll.rsS.OCO last May. against ISl.2iO.000 a year
bjio. Our Imports during the same month were
$7LK5,0C0, compared with $70. 160,000 last year.
This left an excess of exports amounting- to
J41.S47.ViO. ag*inst I3.6SO.000 in 1S39. and a con
siderable portion of this excess was due to the
rapid Increase in exports of American manu
factures.
"irnfavorable rejÂ»orts concerning the wheat
crop have caused more uneasiness than justi
fied, because the larpe increase In acerape
I'ron'.isfs to fully offset all damage reports thus
far received. The condition statement of the
Ijepartment of Agriculture on Jure 1 indicated
a yield of C19,(XK).f>0j bushels, while the total
Crop of 1ES3 was 547,000.000 bushels, which af
fordc a big margin for damage before the yield
falls below last year. Trade reports indicate a
slackening of business and in a few instances
railroad earnings show a decline from top fig
ures. This should be expected. Demand and
j'rices cannot always continue at flood tide;
moderate reactions would probably put trade
on a much more healthy basis and pave the
way for renewed activity next fall. Wall
ctreet is even now discounting such a reaction.
Gold exports have bes n renewed upon a con
siderable scale, but this movement attracted
little attention. Money rates continue easy
and the satisfactory condition of the money
market is the chief source of strength in stocks.
For the next few weeks, or until after the
nominations, we may look for a ir-iiet market.
Ec.me attempts may be made to force a lower
level of prkes. l>ut they are likely to meet with
Indifferent success, there being already a con
siderable short Interest in the market. Stocks
are firmly held and with easy money and disap
jiearance of pome of the uncertainties noted
above there will be pood opportunities for
profitable purchases in the better grade stocks.
On the weak spots the market will be a pur
chase for quick turns."

Wheat Speculation in &Qew York.
NEW YORK. June 20.â The bulls again ob
tained' control of the wheat market this morn
ing and squeezed shorts on the early curb to
the extent of practically 2c a bushel, July sell-
Ing up to 83%c before the regular opening and
from 83%c to S3%c after the official start. It
was an extremely nervous market, with trans
actions on a big scale and bad crop news, to
gether with unexpected strong English cables,
the principal argument in favor of advancing
prices. The pit was in a 'fever of excitement
all the forenoon, prices shifting constantly over
a wide range, accordingly as bulls or bears ob
tained the upper hand temporarily. The cry of
dollar wheat has cropped up In some quarters,
but the best talent regards such a price as very
extreme under present circumstances. Opera
tions during the forenoon reached a total of
about 5,000,000 bushels. Speculators' excite
ment was continued throughout the entire after
noon, with a strong advance in prices, July
selling up to S6c near the close, representing
4c advance for the day and 14c advance the
past two weeks. The December ODtlon was
even stronger, showing 4&C net advance. The
market closed In a burst of excitement at the
top notch for the session and year. Transac
tions altogether amounted to about 7,000,000
bushels.
Boston Wool Market.
Â¦ BOSTON, June 20.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The past week has been a very dull and un
satisfactory one In the wool market. At no
time this year, in fact, has the dullness been
more intensified that It has been since our last
review.. Reports from manufacturing centers
are not of an altogether encouraging nature,
and In some sections some mills are reported as
running at reduced time. Consumers will pur
chase only very sparingly of wool, as they feel
uncertain as to the opening of the lightweight
season and the | London wool sales, the two
events that are anxiously awaited. In the
meantime wools continue very firm in the terri
tories and growers and buyers are apart.
Neiv York Metal Market.
NEW YORK, June 20.â The market for
metals ruled very weak In sympathy with the
continued favorable advices from abroad. Trad
ing, however, was not active. PIglron war
rants were nominally quoted at $14 25 and very
weak in tone. Tin was a shade easier at $30.
Lead continues unsettled on the basis of $3 72V4
#3 77%. Spelter â¢ ruled weak and somewhat
lower at U 1504 20 under an Increase In re
ceipts. Lake copper was dull ami unchanged
at $16 50. The brokers' price for. lead was $3 60
and for copper $16 60.
NrcV 'York Cotton Market.
NEW .YORK. June 20.â Anticipation of strong
Liverpool cables in the morning and fears of
another batch of bad crop news prevented a
bull reaction in the cotton market. The mar
ket closed steady at a net advance of 16 to

the Drlces were marked up, and the feeling is
now weak. Some dealers are already quoting
lower prices. Feedstuffs remain unchanged.

at this time of the year when so many are out

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
With the exception of Berries, the feeling is
rather firm than otherwise. Peaches and Apri
cots rule strong with a good demand, and
Prunes and Plums are also showing more tone.
In spite of the reported large crop this year,
the fruit does not seem to be- coming into this
market. Where it goes Is a mystery, unless
the crop is less than believed. There Is a
first-rate demand for the north, which uses
up a good deal, but the fact remains that the
receipts here are smaller than usual at this
time of the year.

if the wholesale stores put up the shut
ters at 1 or 2 o'clock on that day. The
employes would certainly appreciate an
opportunity to clean up and get ready for
Sunday and better service by them was
a certainty. On Saturday, June 2. at 2
o'clock, Wellman. Peck & Co. set the ex
ample by "closing t>hop." On the follow
ing Saturday Sussman, Wormser & Co.,
c% the opposite side of the street, fol

and a number of others have fallen Into
line.
So far no special hour has been set for
quitting; work, but from a statement by
one of the Interested parties it Is likely
that very soon the wholesale grocers will
call a meeting and come to a decision as
to an hour at which ail will close. At
present only the wholesale grocers are in
the movement, -which is believed -will be
fore Ions extend to other wholesale
houses.
WHOLESALE GROCERS
ARE CLOSING EARLY
THE movement to close the store.*
early on Saturdays has spread Into
the wholesale district and there is
every reason to believe that In the
near future nearly every clerk, account
ant and porter in the large stores of the
city will be given a half-holiday each
week. About two months ago an effort
was made to close the retail stores early
Saturday evenings, and a number of es
tablishments have since been observing
such an "agreement. Where formerly
clerks were kept employed until late at
night they now nave an opportunity to get
out and move around among people.
The first to start the early closing move
ment among wholesale grocers was Well
man. Peck & Co. One of the proprietors
called upon several wholesalers and rep
resented to them that Saturday was an
"off day" in a business sense and that no
great amount of trade if any would be lost
<==jf=;HE report that will" be presented to
morrow night to the general com
.11 mittee of the Native Sons of- the
Golden West who have charge of the
semi-centennial celebration of Admission
day by the committee on naval parade, of
which C. II. Turner of Alcatraz Tarlor is
chairman,' will give in almost complete
detail the plan of that part of the fes
tival, which, together with the sham
naval battle, will probably be the most
novel and attractive feature of the several
days' entertainment.
The committee at its last meeting de
cided to await the return of John D.
Spreckels, who has accepted the position
of commodore of the naval parade, In
order to consult him in regard to certain
details before presenting Its final report.
The scope of the celebration committee,
of which E. Myron Wolf is chairman, will
also have a report to . present. This will
include additional suggestions as to what
there should be In the way of entertain
ment during the four days of festivities.
It has been suggested that as the cele
bration Is to be in remembrance of the
admission of California Into the Lnion
there should be a historic float, among
them on* representing, the passing
through the Golden Gate of the old-tim6
steamship Panama,' which Drought the
news to this city that California had been
admitted into the Union. Whenthat ves
sel entered the harbor she was decked
from stem to stern with flaÂ«s and signals
in honor of the important event., for in
those days news came by the isthmus or
Darien and it took thirty days to obtain
tidings from New -York. A float repre
senting the old Sweeney & Baush tele
graph Station, which stood on Telegraph
Hill, and from which was displayed, by
means of wooden arms from a tuisstafr,
the signal that the Oregon had been
sighted by the station man at Point I,obos
is also proposed. That was the system of
signaling the approach of vessels prior to
1854, when the Iirm named opened Us mag
netic telegraph between Point Lobos and
Telegraph Hill, the first telegraph system
Introduced in the Golden State.
â¢ Yesterday afternoon there was a meet
ing of the conference committee of the
finance committee, at which Police Com
missioner "Newhall presided. Â¦ There were
added to this conference committee, which
subsequently changed its name to the ex
ecutive council of the finance commit
tee, Colonel J. R. Howell as treasurer and
Henry S. Martin as vice chairman. A
number of plans for the collection of
funds, and a number of names suggested
for the finance committee which is to so
licit donations were discussed, but no ac
tion was taken and none will be until the
executive council meets this afternoon at
5 o'clock with the presidents of the local
parlors In order to receive the names of
those who would make pood collectors.
James D. Phelan. chairman of the gen
eral committee, contributed the nrst
amount, $1000. "just to start the thing 1
along." He expressed the hope that many
more who can afford to will equal his do
nation, as it Is the desire of the general
committee to secure at least $50,000 to
carry on the celebration. It was sug
gested that as the citizens will not be
called upon this year to contribute to the
Fourth of July fund, that they give what
they would have given to that fund to the
Admission day celebration.
Milton Besse of Santa Cruz has been se
lected to visit this city to ropresent Santa
Cruz and WatsonvlHe parlors In the mat
ter of fecuring headquarters where they
can hold receptions. These parlors are
arranging for an excursion, to open on
the Sth of September and close on the 12th.
Their members will come to this city to
take part in the festival. Thry intend to
be in it at the beginning and stay with it
until the finish. The members of these
parlors, who will appear In the parade,
will be headed by a ban<l of sixteen
pieces and will be attired in white duck
pantaloons, light negligee shirts, neat tlea,
sashes and soft hata.
The street parade committee at Its
meeting last night decided to send cut
Invitations to the Supervisors of each
county to co-operate with the celebration
committee, calling attention to the faut
that as each county devotea a stated sum
to advertising purposes a portion of that
money be used to" supply a Coat emble
matic of the Industries of the county.
Colonel Boxton, W. C. Wilier and C. H.
Stanyan were appointed a committee to
Invite the foreign Consuls and ascertain
if each will not have arranged a floai to
represent the nation he is Consul for.
The resratta committee will In a few
days confer with those who have sailing
vessels to enter In the races.
The School Board and school children
of the public and the private schools will
bÂ« invited.
The regatta committee met last night
and received representations from tho
Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic Union.
The latter proposed a rowing regatta to
be carried out under the auspices of tha
regatta committee of tho Native Sons
and a committee of the- union. They pro
pose a race over a new course In South
Bay. starting from Channel street, three
quarters ot a mile and return. They will
row senior and Junior single shell, senior
and Junior outrigger shells, senior, inter
mediate and junior barge races; also a
fourteen-oar race by the Naval Militia.
The members of- the reserve at Eureka,
Santa Cruz and San Diego will be lnvitea
to take part In thft latter race. These
races will bo for records.

Those Figures Show That Oakland
Will Have a Population of
About Seventy Thou
sand People.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 20. .
The population of. Oakland will be 70,000
or a little more. S
The census enumerators who have been
working In this city closed their labors
to-day, and while their footings have not
been made, and could not be given out If
they were, it Is estimated that.the:popu
lation will at least reach the figure given,
if not go higher.
Assistant Supervisor, of the Census
Whitney gave that llgure as the result of
a system of rough computation that has
been kept by the letter-carriers of Oakr
land. As assistant supervisor Mr. Whit
ney U prevented from giving- out any
figures upon the census, and a violation
of this would mean a tine of $500; but he
says that the letter-carriers of Oakland
have been watching the daily reports of
the enumerators as they went through
the mails and that they have secured
these figures as a rough result. The car
riers are much interested in the result of
this census, for If the. population of Oak
land goes sufficiently high its rating in
the postal world will be increased and
there will be additional carriers' and ad
ditional pay allowed.
"The carriers," said Mr. Whitney, "have
been watching the daily "reports . that go
through the mails from the enumerators,
and they say that, estimating from what
they have thus seen, the population will
reach 70,000. Of course, they â¢ have no
right. to do this, but "they have done It.
These figures are not the result of any In
formation that I have In my hands.
The last census gave Oakland less than
50,000 population. The city has always
claimed that this census was defective,
and with the annexed district it is claimed
that the population is between 75,000 and
80,000.

As In the Republican National Conven

due to the unprecedented condition of
things and the oversight was accidental.
Realizing this the party leaders In Hono-

The Hawaiian Democratic Convention
met on the 9th of this month and elected
the above named delegates. They will re

proceed to Kansas City. Just what posi
tion the delegates occupy with reference
to the other delegates chosen by the vari
ous States is not as yet known. A meet

Palace Hotel, at which all the Hawaiian
delegates will be present to discuss the
situation and prepare plans for future
action.
The prrsonn-el of the delegation Is repre
sentative of the political and business
world of Honolulu. Prince David is .dis
tantly connected with ex-Queen Ulluo
kalani and was a nephew of King Kala
kaua. He has been free from any political
entanglements, but has now allied him
self with the Democratic party, lately
born in the islands. William H. Cornwell
is a prominent business man and;was once
a member of the Legislature durltig the
regency. John D. Holt is the head of a
large liquor business in Honolulu. John
H. Wise studied for the ministry at Ober

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 20.
Judge Hall granted two divorces to-day
on the ground .of intemperance. In each
case the husband and head of the fam
ily was the one with . the appetite for
strong drink. Mabel A. Jaquith was re
leased from the bonds that bound her to
Alfred H. Jaquith and Ora Briggs was
granted 1 a divorce from George Briggs.
In the case of Mrs. Jaquith against her
husband, the plaintiff testified* that for
over a jrcar and' a half 'since her mar
riage she had been forced to rely upon
her parents' for her support, v While her
husband earned good , wages at his trade
he spent his money - in . appeasing his
thirst. Â¦ Saturday night was his favorite
time for Indulging in alcoholic beverages
to the great detriment of the family purse
and larder. Sunday was spent in sober
ing up and on Monday Jaquith would be
unable to' go " to work.' Finally things
reached such a stage that Mrs. Jaquith
abandoned her husband and' went to live
with 'her parents.. Â¦ .
In the suit of Ora Briggs against George
Briggs, the : plaintiff- declared that a few
years after their marriage in 18S4 her hus
band , developed such an appetite for in
toxicating liquor, that he became utterly
Â¦worthless and refused to work. His In
dulgence in -intoxicants, according to Mrs.
Brigge, on several occasions led 'him to
abuse her:in a cruel manner. On one oc
casion when she refused "him money he
struck her, to the floor. and, brandishing. a
razor-above her head threatened to cut
her throat if she did not give him' money.
The custody of Lyman . E. Briggs, four
teen years old, was -awarded to the
mother. Â¦' ' â¢Â¦'Â¦'- Â¦Â¦-

w. B. Parker Jr. oF Oakland
Had a Narrow Squeak in
the Philippines.
I I / B " PARKER JR - of Oakland
llf and Vacaville returned home
III from Manila on the transport
/ ww Grant after an adventurous
year among the Fflipinos as
manager of a company formed
In this city for the purpose of getting out
the famous teak wood, so much in demand
In the market. Owing to the condition of
affairs in the Philippines the young man
was not able to accomplish much beyond
careful surveys and the gathering . of
knowledge as to how the lumber can be
taken out and marketed at a profit. Even
that much information' was gained at the
risk of his life.
For many months Parker remained in
the Camarines provinces. Southern Luzon
only fifteen miles from General del Pilar's
headquarters. He had an lnterpreterÂ»with
him and a guard of 100 bolo men, who
were in the employ of the company. A
range of mountains formed a partial
barrier between Parker's camp and the
insurgent general's headquarters, but for
all that Parker managed to. have several
brushes with the enemy. The bolo men
in his employ were natural tribal enemies
of the forces under General Pilar and
willing to fight whenever opportunity of
fered. . .
Parker was finally obliged to abanifon
his position because of illness that came
near ending his life. He was handling a
bolo one day when he chanced to scratch
the middle finger of his right hand
Poison from the deadly knife got into the
wound and hand and arm began to swell.
With great difficulty he managed to get
back to Manila, where he spent several
weeks in the hospital, undergoing three
operations and finally losing a finger. Â¦ He
has not yet entirely recovered from his
illness, and will take a long rest at home
before returning to the islands.
The Board of Fire Commissioners, at a
meeting held yesterday, rejected all bids

believing them excessive. The lowest bids

The wedding was one of the prettiest

bunch of white roses, tied with white il
lusion. Miss Harriet A. Bartnett, the
maid of honor, was attired in pink silk,
with hat of the same shade, trimmed with
white illusion. She carried bridesmaid's
roses, fastened with pink illusion.
The bridal party was met at the altar
rail by the groom and his best man, Ed
ward A. Quinn, and the ceremony was
performed by Rev. Father Pius Murphy.
A wedding breakfast followed at the

came downstairs to the dressing room
to make a change. They made it. Their
anger toward each other had been grow
ing all day: A few wordsâ and grease
paint and "liners" were laid down and
at It they went. Through It all sat Jeff
rey Williams. He didn't want to be both

The racket made by tne contestants was
so tremendous that the entire company
gathered around the door. But not one

actor entered the arena. In a firm voice
he called on both men to stop. It was
Brutus and Cassius over again, only there
was no kiss and make-up. The only
make-up used was grease paint in large
chunk3 to conceal facial abrasions and
cranial contusions.
The Alcazar management tried to hush
the matter up, but it leaked out. A black
lump on Emery's cheek caused comment
and questioning; then, as a natural se
quence, came revelation. . ...
Belasco says Emery should get a job in
a foundry sharpening tools and so live
up to his name, and â most unkindest cut
of allâ wheels. Emery says the only thing
Belasco can play is a hose. And so the
matter stands, and the picture lies in
Emery's scrapbook and rankles In the
Belasco mind.

from Jim Jeffries in New York and the
missile smashed to sn.ithereens a mirror

then clinched and a battle royal waged
till George Webster broke In the door and
separated the warring Thespians:
The row^arose over a picture published
in a New York theatrical paper. It was
an excellent likeness, of Mr. Emery- In
fact It was Mr. Emery. He sent It to the
journal himself. Not alone did it go
however. A letter telling of 'his triumphs
in San Francisco accompanied it. An ex
tract .from the billet was printed under
the actor's complacent counterfeit pre
sentment. It read: "Actor Edwin Em

by storm." It was these lines that caused
the storm to break in the Alcazar dress-

J. E. Sweeney, the Brave Fireman, Dies From His Terrible
Woundsâ An Urgent Appeal for Aid Is Made
for His Desritutp F^milv W.
John D. Spreckels _ .'_ ..... $100
SUBSCRIPTION BOOK NOW OPEN AT THE BUSINESS OFFICE OF THE CALL.
JOHN' E. SWEENEY, the brave fire
man, who rescued an aged man
from a burning building at Bryant
and Eleventh streets, has paid the
full penalty for his heroism. He Is dead.
His terrible struggle through the flames
â¢with the eld man in his arms cost him his
life. He was burned past recovery and
no effort could save his life. And the de
partment of which he was a member will
' remember him as one of the most fearless
I men who ever gave up life in obedience
to duty.
There was mournlnc In the Fire De
â¢ partment yesterday, for the dead hero
â¢was well liked. The f-addest phase of It
all Is that the dead man leaves a wife and
;four young children utterly destitute.
There is not even food in the stricken
* home, for the needs of the little family
demanded all cf the small' income of the
husband and father. An appeal is made,
therefore, to charitable* persons, to ren
der assistance sadly needed. Any who
wish to contribute something for . the
widow and her children may do so at the
business office of The Call, where a sub
scription list is open. John D. Spreckel*
opens the list with a subscription of $100.
< The Fire Department will bury the dead
hero with fitting honors. A detail of men
from every company in the department
â¢will attend the funeral, which Will be
'held from St. Joseph's Church, Tenth
street, at 18 o'clock to-morrow morning.
': Sweeney's act is considered to be with
out parallel in Its heroism in the history
cf the local Fire Department. If he had
been willing to sacrifice the old man,
Michael Coyne, whom he sought to save,
he could have saved his own life. Wrap
ping a coat over his head and hands he
dashed through the blinding smoke up to
the second floor of the house,, where he
heard the screams of the old man. Re
moving the coat which had protected him
he placed it over the head of the old man
&nC then dashed downstairs. Half way
down the flames burst out In the hall and
made it an avenue of raging fire.
Sweeney could have escaped had he
dropped the old man, but he dashed on
through the fire with his burden and
dropped Just outside of the door. He had
saved Coyne and sacrificed his own life.
There are few Instances of truer heroism
!n the history -of San Francisco; and gen
erous people should consider It a duty to
relieve the destitution of the little fam
ily the hero left behind him.
The daring rescue which cost the
heroic fireman his life was not the first
which proved to the city that he had that
within him which wins the plaudits of
men and 1 which should insure now. to his
stricken wife and little ones the sub
stantial sympathy of the community.* On
August 15, 1S96, in the early moaning
when Sweeney was going to his home, he
saw fire bursting from the house f at 1014
and 1016 Bryant street. He heard the
screams of a man and woman, John and
Maria Brodie, who were helpless and im
prisoned in the burning building. â¢'
Utterly heedless of imminent danger to
himself Sweeney dashed into, the house
and located the aged couple on the sec
ond floor. He carried them to^ what
seemed to be the only avenue of escapeâ
the rear stairs. ' The flames had, eaten
them away and a pit of fire was under
him.' He carried the old man and woman
to the front of the house and signaled to
his brother firemen, who had arrived, to
throw him a rope. This was done and
he lowered his changes to the ground in
safety. When they were beyond harm he
descended from the 'burning building to
the sound of a cheering throng who had
seen his heroic act.
At the meeting of the Board of Fire
Commissioners last night the following
resolutions on the death of John Edward
Sweeney were adopted:
Whereas, This board has just received the
sad intelligence of the death of Fireman John
Edward SwÂ»eney from Injuries received In the
discharge of his duty by sacrificing: his own
life in saving- the life of another. Â¦ .
' Resolved, That we do hereby extend to his
bereaved widow and family our heartfelt sym
pathy and deep sense of loss in the death of a
member of this department, whose heroic con
duct will forever be an example and inspira
tion to his fellow-members.
Resolved. That this resolution be spread on
the minutes of the board and a copy thereof
be presented to the family of the deceased.
Resolved.. That the members of this board
attend the funeral In a body.

DEATH CLAIMS HIS LIFE IN

Five hundred tents, formerly of the
White City at the Presidio, but' recntly
.condemned and sold to' Nossen & Co., are
stored In an old warehouse at 112 Clay
street. Their presence has caused trouble
In the neighborhood. iS%i >!^
The tents were bought in at auction
more than 'a week ago and they had hard
ly been stored in the warehouse by their
new owner when it became known
that a case of ' smallpox had de
veloped at the Presidio, and at once
the people living in the neighbor
hood of the warehouse demanded that
the tents be fumigated if that had' not al
ready been done. It -had not, so the
health officer, Dr. O'Brien, has ordered
that they be thoroughly fumigated under
the direction of the Board of Health be
fore any of them shall be taken out of
the warehouse. â¢ . Â¦ ' .
As a matter of fact, however, there is
no danger of Infection from the old tents.
They have been out in the wind and the
rain since a year ago last spring, and It
is seven months since any â¢ soldier - has
lived in them. When the camps were
cleared away these tents that were unfit
for further Government use were.' left
standing until they could all be sold in
a bunch. SoTne cases of smallpox . did
break out In. the camps last fall, but
whenever a case broke out the tent which
the patient had occupied was burned, as
were those in 'the immediate vicinity.
Then the ground all around the place of
infection was sprinkled with lime, and in
each instance the regiments to which the
patients belonged * were moved -over -..to
Angel Island. Smallpox never .appeared
the samq place in the camps twice., .
â¢The last- case of smallpox developed in
the camp where- the casuals have been
quarte'red. 1 Several tents have been burned
as usual, but' from that camp no tents
have condemned and no tents fjave
been sold. Moreover the : smallpox did not
break out until the condemned tents had
been carted away.
