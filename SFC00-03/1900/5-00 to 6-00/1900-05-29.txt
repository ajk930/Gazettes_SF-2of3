In my conversation with Dr. William
son this morning I was pleased to hear
that not only In his prof esslonal ' but in
his official capacity he would do every
thing in his power to assist In the proper
line of investigation. I also understood
from him that the Federal quarantine offi
cers worked in accord with the Board of
Health, and there was a promising condi
tion of harmony of purpose which was
in every way encouragfng In the efforts
to arrive at the real truth. I took occa
sion to remark to the Health Officer that
It was of the utmost Importance to state
one way or the other whether or not
there was a single case of the plague In
San Francisco . at the present time, and
that he was in his official capacity capa
ble of answering that question directly.
He gave me to understand that it was
not possible for a case of plague to exist
In this city and he not know It.

Being attracted by a 'store that had
Chinaman you would meet. This was de
cidedly noticeable and made one feel most
uncomfortable. I was not surprised to see
this In view of the former attempts on the
part of the Chinese residents ta
resist the authority of the Health
Board In enforcing the sanitary regu
lations; hence It was considered
advisable that an attendant from the of
fice of the Chief of Police should quietly
accompany us on our rounds, and when
the doctor remarked that there waÂ« an
other reason for wearing an overcoat It
was understood to bÂ« for the purpose of
carrying a weapon to be used for pro
tection. In fact, care was taken In tha
course of our stroll not to excite undue
attention on the part of the Chinese, who
were to be found / scattered everywhere
over the densely populated blocks. It ap
pears customary among thrse Orientals
to gather about the officials .while at their
work and very often the sanitary Inspec
tors In attempting to enforce health or
ders are quickly surrounded by a danger
ous and threatening mob. It was to avoid
this kind of force that It was necessary
to appear as If we were only mere visit
ors bent on an errand of ordinary
curiosity.
that most Of the people do not think such
procedures are necessary, but It is. also
apparent that the public is in a very un
certain state as to whether the plague In
the first place ever appeared at all: that
there were . ever any well authenticated
cases, upon which legitimate conclusions
could be based, and that the expectation
that any plague will make its appearance
in the future is without foundation. One
citizen, whom I asked In a casual . way
about the existence of the plague ap
peared to speak the mind of the com
munity when he said that no one knew
what to believe; and that the public mind
was in a deplorably chaotic condition in
regard to reconciling directly conflicting
facts. He remarked that the doctors were
not" apparently sure of .their diagnoses.
Others : sai-d â¢ the plague was ' hidden In
certain sections of Chinatown and Its ex
istence, although known to the authori
ties, was not published. Altogether It
would be very assuring If some one In
whom confidence couli be placed should

THE PLAGUE IS
NOT IN THE CITY
Under the decision erf the Federal
judges the Board of Health of this city
has no authority to quarantine a district,
the power being vested, under the char
ter, in the Board of Supervisors. The
Board of Health adopted a resolution
therefore declaring that plague had
existed in Chinatown and that to pre
vent its recurrence the district should
be quarantined. This resolution was
submitted to the Supervisors, for adop
tion, but after a long discussion the
board postponed definite action until
this morning at II o'clock. At the same
time a resolution denouncing the Board
of Health for its unwarranted actions in
the entire matter and calling upon the
members to resign their positions was
introduced and referred to the Health
and Police Committee.* If the Health
Board refuses to resign the Mayor is
called upon to remove them.
ing the decision of the Federal judges
the State Board of Health decided
first to warn officers of neighboring
counties not to allow Chinese or Japan
ese to enter the different counties. The
injustice of this measure was manifest
and it was withdrawn. In order, how
ever, that the crusade against San Fran
cisco might be stopped and that -wiser
councils might prevail, the State board
instructed the local board to quarantine

that such a course would commend Itself

an end.- I am pleased to say also that the
Marine Hospital service, through Its chief
medical officer. Dr. J. J. Kinyoun. was
kind enough to offer me facilities for see
ing cases which might present themselves
at quarantine. In ordor to pet a good
preliminary view of the situation I had
the privilege of visiting: Chinatown this
morning in company with the president
of the Health Hoard of San Francisco,
and while on this Journey thoroughly dis
cussed the situation with him. To such as
had never vt3ited Chinatown the scenes
which can be witnessed there wouM be a
revelation, but of the details in this re
gard I will state later when further op

of something unusual having happened.
There was an idea as of something like
an air of desolation about the place and

BOARD OF HEALTH CONFESSES TO A FAMOUS EXPERT
WHO CROSSED THE CONTINENT AT THE INSTANCE OF THE NEW YORK HERALD AND THE CALL
THAT THERE IS NO BUBONIC PLAGUE IN THIS CITY

PRICE JFIVE CENTS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.In presenting his resolution McCarthy
stated that he did so with the full belief
that I there has not been one case of bu
bonic plague in the city. He said he was
not a medical man, but the most reputa
ble physicians acknowledged that the
plague was a very difficult disease to diag
nose. There had. been two seasons of al
leged plague which were unwarranted by
the'facts. The resolution, which waa re
ferred to the Health and Hospital Com
mittee, f>ayB: .
RESOLUTIONS were presented by
Supervisor McCarthy at last
night's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors condemning the action of
the Board of Health- in regard to the al
leged epidemic of bubonic plague. The
resolutions recite that it is -the opinion
of the board that on account of the re
peated and unwarranted declarations by
the -Health Board that such plague has
existed and is existing that the mem
bers thereof should resign their office. -
HEALTH BOARD IS
ASKED TO RESIGN
Later in the day the restraining order
was signed by the Judge and served on
the defendants.
It follows from these considerations that the
defendants have failed 'to Justify their action
in the premises, and that an Injunction must
issue as prayed for ln the bill of complaint.
The observations of the court in these two
cases are not entirely Inappropriate to the reg
ulations of the Board of Health and the Instruc
tions of the supervising r-jrjjeon ffeneral of the
Marine Hospital service offered by the defend
ant as authority for the regulations they are
now engaged in enforcing against the Chinese
inhabitants.
The court here quoted from the case of
Ah-Kow vs. Nunan, 5 Sawyer 552, on the
queue-cutting ordinance: also from the
case of Lee Sing. 43 Fed. 359, where an or
diance was declared invalid that required
Chinees -to Â¦ live in a certain part of the
city. Continuing the decision pays:
The regulations are directed against the
Asiatic race exclusively and by name. There
is no pretense that previous residence, habits,
exposure to dlnease, methods of living or phys
ical condition has anythine to do with their
classification as subject to the regulations.
They are denied the privilege of traveling, and
this privilege is denied to Chinese persons born
in the United States, as well as to those born
elsewhere.
The Broad View.
the diseases exist in the particular State or
Territory where the regulations are to be en
forced. If this lg the proper interpretation
there is the objection that It .dcs not appear
that the President has found that that plague
exists ln Pan Francisco or ln California or. In
deed, anywhere elpe in the United States: nor
does It appear that the supervising surgeon gen
eral has so found, or that he has prescribed any
regulations requiring the administration of Haff
ltlnn prophylactic under any conditions or to
parties seeking transportation from one place In
the State to another place in the same State,
or from one State to another. The only re
striction imposed by the surgeon general Is that
transportation companies shall refuse transpor
tation to Asiatics, unless provided with the
certificates of the defendant Kinyoun. What
examination or treatment Is reenuired to en
title a Chinese person to this certificate Is not
provided ln the Instructions of the supervising
surgeon general. The instructions are, there
fore, plainly Insufficient in these essential par
ticulars to justify the defendant Kinyoun.
WASHINGTON', May 2S.â Advices
received at the Naval Observa
tory from Its agents in various
points in the South shov/ that
favorable weather prevailed for
observing: the sun's eclipse to-day;
that the contact occurred very elope to
schedule time, and that the programme
arranged was carried out without a hitch.
Three parties were sent out from the ob
servatory, viz.: One to PlneHurst. N. C,
in charge of Professor Aaron N. Skinner;
one to Barnesville, Ga., In charge of Pro
fessor Milton Updegraff: and one to Grif
fin. Ga.. in charge of Professor Stlmson
J. Brown. Superintendent C. H. Davis of
the observatory was in communication
with these officials 'by telegraph, and dur
ing the day he received the following ad
vices:
PIXEHURST. N".- Câ Clear sky. and fa
vorable, permlttinir successful observations of
the eclipse. All seventeen instruments suc
cessfully operated. Contact occurred very close
to predicted time. Corona very fine. Mercury

Professor fTpdegfaff. at Barnesville, Ga.,
and Professor Brown, at Griffin, Ga.,
merely reported that their observations
were "successful.
Professor Lord's Discoveries.
ATLANTA. Ga., May 2S. â In every sec
tion of the Southern States to-day over
which the belt of totality of the sun's
eclipse extended the weather was ideal
for the observation of this remarkable
phenomenon. In the southern portion of
Alabama there was some haziness, but
other than this the astronomers and
scientists who located their observatories
In North and South Carolina. Georgia.
Alabama and Louisiana report that the
weather could not have been more aus
picious for the study of the sun's eclipse
and to secure splendid photographs of the
details attending the passage of the great
orbs.
The most notable feature of the day was
the discovery by Professor I^ord of the
Ohio State University, who believes he
obtained results that tend to prove that'
the mysterious matter which .forms the
corona is to be found also in the solar
prominences, and the existence of pro
tuberances on the sun as reported by
Professor Pickering of Harvard. What
constitutes. the gaseous element surround
ing the sun, however, has not been deter
mined, and if any astronomer has solved
this problem he has not committed him
gelf to-night.
BARNESVILLE. Ga.. May 2S.â Amid a
perfect arrangement of detail, with good
weather, conditions and with no hind
rances or defects to prevent success, the
varying phases of the solar eclipse were
observed by the .Government astronomers
at the United States Observing Station
here to-day. The photographic work waa
unusually successful, five cameras in-
"The sky was clear at this point and
the full programme of thp eleven photo
graph exposures were carried out. The
corona appeared strikinglv like that of
the eclipse in India in 189S. The Chabot
expedition has the only apparatus in the
world that will give short exposures on
the bright Inner corona, while giving long
exposures on the faint part on the same
plate. The pictures taken vary from two
to twelve-hundredths of a second at the
moon's limb and four to eight seconds at
the outer limit, two plates giving four to
eight-hundredths inside and four and
THOMASTON. Ga.. May 2S.-Tho
eclipse observations here were conducted
under perfect conditions, the totality be
ing a scant ?5 seconds. Not a cloud" was
visible anywhere near the corona, but tn
the west fleecy flecks were discerned.
Standing pome distance off from the co
rona's outside rim. a brilliant star was
distinctly visible. The effect at the time
of complete obscuration was that of a
deep twilight.
The astronomers began work at 5
o'clock. A squad of Deputy Sheriffs
guarded the approaches to thÂ«Â« observa
tory tents, it having been feared that the
stream of people would jar the earth and
affect the delicate Instruments. Professor
Campbell of the Lick eclipse expedition
was at his observatory at 5 o'clock and
every man was in his place an hour be
fore the first contact was noted.
Professor Campbell gave the following
signed statement:
â¢ The sky was clear but net very blue.
Rapidly approaching clouds from thÂ«Â»
southwest obscured the sun less than one
minute after totality. The programme,
which was almost wholly photographic
work, was fully carried out except in tbo
case of one spectroscope, whose clock re
fused to work. The coronal streamer 1 '
were somewhat similar to those observed
in India in 1898. There were two on tho
west of about equal intensity about a dis
tance equal to five or six diameters of the
sun. The upper one of the. two to the east
was much stronger than the lower one
and was observed out to. about four
diameters. The streamers sepmed to be
nearer thp solar equator than In lS^S. The
shadow bands were distinctly observed
inclining from about 38 degrees west of
north to 38 degrees east cf south. travel-
Ing northeast."

OVAR. Portugal. May" 23.â Thp weather
was clear here to-day. The English expe
dition observed the eclipse satisfactorily.
The duration of the totality was und<>r
three seconds. The thermometer dropped
four degrees. The planet Mercury was
plainly visible. Df spite some clouds excel
lent negatives were obtained of the co
rona, which differed little from that ob
served during the last eclipse In India.
TRIPOLI, May 28.â The eclipse expedi
tion under Professor Todd of Amherst
College completed successful observation*
with twenty telescopes. Including one of
twentv-four Inches. The corona was seen
for -fifty-two seconds and was an exact
duplicate of that of January. 1839. com
pletely confirming the eleven years' period
of the corona variation w!th the sun spots.
The weather was splendid. *
The photographic programme was com
pletely carried out by Professor Walter
M. Aundor of the Royal Observatory at
Greenwich and his assistants. The at
mospheric glare present was unfavorable
to photographs of the outer corona's
streamers or of the partial phase. Most
Interesting observations of thf* shadow
bands, however, were obtained. The bands
traveled fn the same direction both before
and after the eclipse, not In continuous
Tines, but in square spots like a passing
flock of birds.
ALGTERS. May 2S.â The eclipse was ob
served here under fine conditions. The sky
was almost cloudless and the atmosphere
almost transparent, though not of tho.
Â«!eep blue usually associated with ttm
Mediterranean. Observing parties were
here from England. France, Germany,
Italy and Switzerland, the largest being
the British, whose best observations were
taken from the roof of the Hotel de la
Regcnce.
As the totality approached the effect
was weird. Darkness swpt thr earth;
the sea lost its deep blue and took a neu
tral gray tint: trees became funereal pur
ple. When the last ray of sunlight fade*,
the corona Instantly shone forth, unusu
ally large and brilliant, extending to Mer
cury, shining with intense white luster
two degrees away. The shape of the co
rona was almost â¢ exactly that of the
eclipse of 1S7S as seen In the United States,
namely, two great wings, one shooting
almost vertically upward and the othrr
downward, both ajmost exactly on a soiar
equator.
As Seen in Algiers.
LONDON. May 2S.â The conditions ln
London for observations of the sun's
eclipse were good to-day. The day was
somewhat cloudy, but at 2:47 p. m. th<*
sun shone out brightly, and the circular
shadow over the disk was remarkable and
clear-cut. The sun was Intermittently ob
scured, but the observers had ample timÂ©
to obtain valuable results.
MADRID. May 2S.â Oreat interest was
manifested in the eclipse. A number of
excursion trains were run to Argamasllla,
Elch, Navalmoral and Plasencia. As
tronomers from all cour^ries of Europe
assembled. M. Flammanon represented
France and Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer
Great Britain. The Infanta Isabel went
to Argamarilla to view the eclipse. An
enormous crowd of slght-seer3 occupied
the different points of vantage. The in
flux was so great at Plasencia that many
had to sleep in the railway cars. Bright
sunshine and a cloudless sky prevailed
everywhere. The British astronomers ar
ranged to take photographs every ten
seconds. M. Flammarion estimates that
some time must elapse before the com
plete results of the observations be
known '\ . I Â«
DENVER. May 28.â While Professor H.
A. Howe was waiting this morning about
2 o'clock in the Chamberlain Observatory
for the sun to arl9e and the eclipse to
begin he made one of the most Important
observations of the year, the rediscovery
of the planet Eros. Thia ttny planet,
which was discovered only two years ago
at â¢ the Berlin Observatory, has been
looked for since last September.- the time
when, according fo calculations. It should
emerge from behind the sun. Astronomers
all over the world have been scanning th*
skies for It but without success. Profes
sor Howe discovered the planet near tho
first point of Aries.
According to Professor Howe's observa
tions of the eclipse thp first contact oc
curred at 5 o'clock 44 minutes 22.6 second.*,
and the last contact at 7 o"clock 37 min

_The defendant. J. J. Kinyoun, as Quarantine
Of fieer of the United States at the port of San
Francisco, Justifies his action upon the author
ity of the telegram received by him from Dr.
Â¦ANyman. dated May 21. 1000, and it is contended
that the instructions contained in' this telegram
nre bawd upon the -provisions of ' the act ' of
March 2Â» 1S9O <2S Stat!. 31). -. v "
â¢ It will be observed that the statute Is open to
the . interpretation ; that the promulgation of
rules .and regulations to prevent I the : epread of
ttie ; diseases named In the stattute Is made to
depend upon the fact that it has been made to
appear to the satisfaction of the President that
It therefore appears that the ad
ministration of ' Haffkine prophylac -
tic to Chinese persons departing from
San Francisco has no relation to the
public health of the inhabitants of
this city and cannot bs sustained , by
any such claim on the part of its
Board of Health.
It apoenrs from the Instructions of Dr. Wal
ter Wyman. the supervising surgeon general of
tho Marine Hospital service, that the llaffklne
prophylactic is not designed as a preventive
after a pereon has been exposed to the disease.
On the co'itrnry. its administration under such
a condition of the human system Is -declared
to.be tfansrerous to life. It Is administered for
the purpose of preventing contagion from expos
ure after Inoculation, and for that' alone. . A
person about to -enter an infected place should
therefore secure this treatment, but a person
departing from an Infected place should not be
so treated. For the latter contingency - Dr.
Wyman prescribes another and very different
remedy, namely, inoculation with the Yersln
Inoculation Not a Preventive.
There Is however. 1 a further and amor* seri
ous objection to Â¦ these regulations adopted by
the defendants.
The conditions of a great city f requently
present unexpected emergencies affecting the
public health, comfort and convenience. Under
euch circumstances officers charged with the
duties pe'rtalnlng to this department of the
municipal government should be clothed with,
fufflcient authority to deal with the conditions
ln a prompt and effective manner. Measures
of this character, having a uniform operation
and reasonably adapted to the purpose of pro
tecting the health and preserving thÂ» welfare
of the inhabitants of a city, are constantly
upheld by the courts as valid rets of legisla
tion, however inconvenient they may prove to
be, and a wide discretion has also been sanc
tioned in their execution. But when the mu
nicipal authority has neglected to provide
suitable rules and regulations upon the sub
ject, and the offlcers are left to adopt ouch
methods as they may deem proper for the oc
casion, their acts are open to Judicial review

** Personal Rights Are Sacred.
I In the recent case 1 of Blue vs. Beach. 56
N*. E. Si>. the Supreme Court of Indiana had
tinder consideration . a law of the State and an
ordinance of the city of Terre Haute, prohibit
ing persons from attending the public schools
who had not been vaccinated. The court sus
tained the validity of the measure, but in ar
riving at that conclusion It states very clearly
the principles and limitations embodied in
such . legislation. It says:
" "An a general proposition, whatever law* or
regulations are necessary tÂ« protect Â«ie pub
lic health and secure public comfort is a
legislative question, and appropriate measures
intended and calculated to accomplish these
enda are not subject to Judicial review. But
nevertheless such measures or means must
have some relation to thp end In vlow. for.
und.r the mere guise of the police power, per
sonal rights and those pertaining to private
property will not b*> permitted to be arbitra
rily Invaded by the legislative department, anri
consequently Its determination is not final, but
is open tp review by the courts. â¢ â¢ â¢
Acts of the Board Unjustifiable.
In the light of these well-established prin
ciples the action cf thÂ«Â» defendants as described
in the bill of complaint cannot be justified.
The regulations they have adopted appear to be
without legislative authority; but, assuming that
thsy have the sanction of a general authority
under the resolution of May 18, 1900, still they
cannot be sustained. They are not based upon
any established distinction- in the conditions
that are supposed to attend this plaÂ«ue, or the
persons exposed to Its contagion, but they are
boldly directed against the Asiatic or Mongol
ian race as a class, without regard to the pre
vious condition, habits or exposure to disease,
or residence of the Individual; and the only
Justification offered for this discrimination was
a suggestion made by counsel for the defend
ants ln the course of the argument that this
particular race Is more liable to the < plague
than any other. â¢ No evidence haÂ«, however,
been offered to "support this claim, and it is
not known to be a fact. This explanation
must therefore be dismissed as unsatisfactory.
This restriction, it is alleged, discriminates
unreasonably against the complainant and
other Chinese residents, confines . them within
the territorial limits of the city and county
ar*d deprives them of their liberty, causing
U^em treat' and. irreparable ; loss and Injury.
"-Regulations Should Bs Reasonable.
ThÂ» city has a population of about 350.000.
but the restriction does not apply to any of
the inhabitants other than Chinese or Asiatics,
and the inhabitants other than Chinese or
Asiatics are permitted to depart from and re
turn to the city without being subject to the
inoculation imposed upon the Chinese Inhab
itants.
It appears that there arf> about 23.000 Chines
residents in thÂ» city of San Francisco, and
while it Is well known that a large number
of these people are domiciled within the area
designated as the Chinese quarter, neverihp
leF.s there are a great many scattered over the
city pngagod ln various employments. Xo re
strictions have bepn placed upon any of the
Chinese residents ia passing from one part of
the oity to the other, nor has any house, block
or Faction of the city been declared infected
or unsanitary. There if, therefore, no fact
established by the Hoard of Supervisors or by
the Board of Health from which an Inference
might be drawn that any particulars class of
persons, or person? occupying a particular dis
trict, were liable to develop, or in danger of
developing, the plasrue. The restriction Is that
no Chinese person !*hall depart from the city
without being inoculated with the serum called
the HatTkine Prophylactic.
Illegal Discrimination Proved.
1 It thus appears that suitable pro
vision has been innds in the city
chnrtsr for tlis necessary legislation
providing rules r.nd regulations to
sscurc proper ssnitary conditions in
the' city and for the protection of the
public health, but we are not advised
that the Board of Supervisors has
taken any action whatever in that
direction, and the resolution of tha
Board of Health furnished to tho
qgurt fails to disclose the method it
has. adopted for that purpose under
the conditions it has declared to exist.
Werieed not, however, dwell upon the
manifest lack of legislative authority
to enable the Board of Health to deal
with this important subiect. It is suf
ficient for the present purpose to
mention the fact as one of the fea
tures of the situation to be consid
ered in connection with the regula
tions which the complainant allegss
have been imposed upon him and
other Chinese residents of the city by
the defendants.
Section 4 provides, arnon;? othfr things, that
the beard si--all enforce all ordinances, rules
find regulations which may be adopted by the
Supervisors for the carrying out and enforce
ment of a coed sanitary condition in the city
and county, find for the prote-.-t'on of tho pub
lic liselth. ar.d the board is iequ!red to sub
mit to the Supervisors frcm time to time a
tlraft of such ordinances rules ant! regulations
as it may dtsm necessary to promote the ob
ject mentioned ln the section.
By section 1 of art'.cle 2 of th<? charter, the
legislative powe- of the city and county ot
San Frtnclseo is vested In a legislative body
designated as thi BcarU of Supervisors, and
in section 8 it is provided that every legisla
tive act or tho city ar.d county Ehall be by
ordinance.
Section 3 of article X of the City Char
ter, designating the powers of the Board
of Health, was read by the court. Con
tinuing ho said:
quarantine officer of the United States at the
port of San Francisco, in response to the order,
has produced a telegram from , the Secretary
of Â¦ the Treasury requesting the Inspection ! of
all Asiatics before beinir allowed to leave the
; city.
Injunction the Proper Remedy.
The court is of the opinion that' injunction
is the proper remedy. | The cause of notion Js
not merely that the complainant la deprived,
1 of his personal liberty, but a number of others
; similarly Pittmted are being deprived by the
defendants of their -right t" travel from ban
Francisco to other parts of the State in the
pursuit of lawful business, anri thl3 right. It
is alleged, has a pecuniary value to the com
plainant ln excess of the amount required to
give this court Jurisdiction of the case. .The
permission to travel, being by the acts of the
defendants coupled with - an aliened unlawful
condition or restriction. It la the province or
the court to Â» Inquire Into the . facts and re
move the restri-tion if found unlawful. This
is undoubtedly the principle Involved in the
numerous cases-where courts have granted in
junctions to relieve parties from the restric
tions and pecuniary injuries inflicted by boy
cotts, lock-out* and strikes. â¢ â¢ â¢ In our
opinion*, the. bill Is ' insufficient and the paroi
exception must be overruled..

ber of the American and Now York Acad

THE State Board of Health held yes
tcrrJay a most important session nt
which prominent local merchants
and representatives of the Southern
Pacific Company were given an opportuni
ty to outline the tremendous evil which
will follow a" continuation of thÂ»e plague
fcare. Aftfr a thorough 'discussion the
State Board referred the matter to the
local beard with the understanding that
the Chinese district I:; this city be quar
antined, neither as a matter of precau
tion against lhe p'agiio nor as an admis
sion that it exists her*', but as a measure
designed to conciliate these who are seek
ing to injure the city by the circulation
of rensationa! reports.
Among thope at the meeting were Dr.
D. D. Crowley of Oakland. Dr. BazÂ«Â»t of
San Francirco. Dr. Rugglos of Stockton.

When the StPte L5o;\rd of Health met in , ;
the rooms of th*> Gmnd Hotel the rep- '
Tf sentaiivr-s of the railroad and business ;
houses of the city had cot arrived. Dr. D. I
D. Crowley, who was in the chair in the .
absence of Dr. Hiil, president' of tha !
beard, instructed I>r. A. M. Henderson to 'Â¦
read the rt-solution the latter had intro- j
duced. Dr. Henderson then read his res- j
olutiori,. which in effect stated that the
plague had exisued In this city, but had
been limited to the Chinese quarter, ar.d !
that it woiilii be impossible for the local I
Board of Health to inoculate all Chinese 'â¢
ar.d Japanese residents'; therefore it was i
the duty of the State board to notify the j
health authorities in tho counties eoriticu- !
ous to Snn Francisco to prevent the en- Â¦
trance ir.to their respective counties cf i
A?;ath-s who did not possess certificates '
of Inoculation.
Dr. Gardner Objects.
Dr. Gardner, the well-known railroad
surgeon. Â«s granted the privilege of ad- 1
dressing the board. "In rising to object '
to the pa??:tge of that resolution," he '
said. "I would like to call on some of the !
representatives of the bodies of.this city !
and some of 'our physicians, who will J
point out the danpers to commercial in- 1
t^re?ts if srch an order be passed. I un- !
demand there has been no bubonic '
plague cir.ee the lr.th of May. I under- j
stand further that according to the au- '
ihoritios mat ten days is the time alloted !
for the lr.fection to spread, and yet we â¢
have had no new case? to-day. I fail j
to see why th<re should be a quarantine i
en this city nn that account. I would '
like to introduce some of the commercial I
men of this city, who will express their ;
views on the question." No objection be- i
ing offered, Dr. Lane was called upon, and i
he raid he could not see how a quarantine j
could b? placed on the Asiatics outside !
the r!ty without including the white pop- i
ulation. "\\V com- in contact with them." !
he said, "on the streets and car?; they wash Â¦
rur clothes: they are in the houses as '
servants. If plague no longer exists here â¢
why ask onttide Boards of Health to close !
their ports . We must all agree that such {
a move would endanger our commercial 1
interest? and I hope the board will be
cautious in its action."
At tnis moment a score of merchant*,
railroad and professional men entered the
room and the discussion became hitrhlv
Interesting. William Sprouic, freight
traffic manager of the Southern Pacific
was invited to address the body, and In
part no paid:
Sproule Sees Danger Ahead.
t 3,',^ ll UT y ermissi on. Mr Chairman.
I would like co say that that resolution
announces definitely, to the world that the
bubotuc plague exists in San Francisco."
l>r. Crowley interrupted the speaker to
remark that he ttid not think it did but
Mr :sproule. continuing, said? "Technically
it dors. If there is a quarantine, as a mat",
tor of fact it must be here. I would say
that the company I represent in part has
the same interests in the question as any
citizen. We are here because we are face
to face with n most serious and tremend
ous situation. A declaration of that sort
will paralyze the industries of this State
in a manner unparalleled In the historv of
the community. The great strike, which
did so much injury to us all. will be a
trifle. The taint of contagion will be upon
every orchard product in every form. To
day the merchants of San Francisco are
withholding th<t money necessary to thÂ°
farmers, as they fear such action as this.
I knov.- one merchant who has $30,000 In
check? unsigned on his desk. The fruits
ar<> being handled by tho Asiatics in th<Â»
field, and hundreds are employed in the
canning industry. In short, the entire hor
ticultural product of this State will suf
for by that resolution. Your action here
is known all ever the United States. It
is known throughout the commercial
world and will cause great injury to the
State. I have spoken of the horticultural
products particularly tfceause it is so evi
dent that orehardists will be great suf
ferers. It must appeal to you that this
Is a stIous question. I* plague does not
exist, why place the community in quar
antine-? If there is doubt that It exists. I
beg of you to exercise the most care, be
cause It affects the whole industrial com
munity of this State."
Irving M, Scott followed with a' short
speech, in which he indorsed every word
uttered by Mr. Sproule. He told of his
trip into the country on last Friday with
a score of other gentlemen and the dis
cussion that arose over the quarantining
of the city. Hp said there were all
classes represented and all had the same
feeling that the plague had either spent
Its force or never extsted. "If it has
spent its force." he said, "what is the use
of this quarantine? He also be-^ed the
board to give the matter serious consid
eration.
Dr. Crowley took a hand in the discus
sion at this point to state that the State
Board wanted- the opinions of ail present;
but wanted it understood that the'mem
bers of thai body had the interests of the
State at heart: so much so that it had
telegraphed to Texas, requesting that the
quarantine be taken off. â¢
Business Will Be Paralyzed.
John C. Stubbs. third vice president of
the Southern Pacific, then delivered a.
strong speech on the subject. At the out
set he called attention to the wldspread
report which was spread a short while
ago of the arrival in New York harbor
of a ship loaded with coffee from an In
fected South American port; how it was
smuggled to Chicago despite the efforts
to prevent it landing by health offlcers
and the danger of a widespread infection
ln the Windy City through the drinking
of the coffee. He said If the State Board
of Health took any such action as was
contemplated the news would be heralded
throughout the country and other States
would follow the precedent set by Texas
and bar their ports to tho products of
this State. , -
He dwelt on the fact that Louisiana
had requested the railroad not to sell
tickets to poor whites, negroes and
Aslatfcs, as they would not be permitted
to enter that State. H6 asked the board
to be careful and said that anything done
should be founded on unquestionable
facts. If there is danger, he said, it was
the duty of the board to prevent it. 'He
drew attention to the fact that the Chin
ese had been circulating among the people
during the past fifteen days and yet there
had not been a spread of the dread mal
ady. He said not enough evidence of
plague existed for the board to call down
a paralyzation of the States' industries.
He contended that if the resolutions were
passed such a dire result would certainly
follow.
If there was evidence that plague ex
isted, he said, the gentlemen present, who
represented varied interests in the com
munity, would jiot fail to come to the
assistance of the Health Board. He
thought they felt as he did that there was
no danger of it being carried to outside
ports or States. He reiterated that tho
board should take careful action,' , as a
quarantine would tie the city - up - for
months. Once started It would take much
lonper to release thp quarantine. 1 To
prove his assertion that the plague scare
was doing irreparable injury to the State
Mr. Stubbs read the headings from edi
torials and articles printed all over the
country.'. â¢Â¦ , â¢
Attcrnf-y Thomas, who wns also present
pointedly asked at this juncture- "If
plague Â»xlsted. why did the Health Board
aiicv.- the Chinese to leave the city?"
His interrogation remained unanswered."

UNITED STATES Circuit , Judge
Morrow read his opinion yester
day morning In the matter of the
petition of Wong Wai for a writ
of injunction to restrain the Board of
Health of San Francisco and Federal
Quarantine Officer Kinyoun from inocu
lating Chinese , and Japanese with Haff
kine prophylactic fluid, and from prevent
ing them from leaving the city. After re
citing the allegations and the prayer of
the petition; Judge Morrow said:, 1 -
Dr. Henderson told why he introduced
the original resolution which brought on
the discussion. Andrew Carrigan took oc
casion to say that the merchants were not
opposed to the Board of Health. He also
wanted to know why Chinatown could
not be quarantined. He said that the
merchants would contribute funds for the
employment of a "pickax" brigade if the
local police force was not capable of keep
ing a cordon around the infected district
Dr. Blunt of Texas added a ray of sun
shine by saying: "Put on a strong quar
antine on Chinatown, allow no citizens to
go in or out and he would advise raisin"
the quarantine in thirty days."
Merchants Want to Aid.
r Dr. C. A. nugglos of Stockton advised
a house to house investigation. He said
all chattels found in the Chinese quarters
that might breed germs should be, de
stroyed. He also said he was In favor of
quarantining Chinatown. Mr. Stubbs ask
ed that the Health Board take the mer
chants into its confidence. John F Mer
rill of Holbrook. Merrill &' Stetson said
that the merchants had been for 'year*
In the "dumps" and are getting out of it
and they should not be injured? in busi
ness by a quarantine. IJ e said it would
frighten the world. Mr. Merrill said the
merchants would help the board in Its
efforts to stay the spread of disease but
appealed to the State Board not to have
an out of town quarantine.
Dr. Williamson of the local Board of
Health was called upon, and told what
his fellow members had done to drive out
the plague. He regretted to say that in
junctions tied the hands of the board and
.that the press had unjustly charged that
the Health Board had got up the scare
for the purpose of getting a larger appro
priation to pay salaries to political fa
vorites.
Dr. Crowley positively stated that the
local board would have to take action im
mediately. In order to consider or recon
sider the resolution, he called upon Dj
Henderson, who introduced it. The lattet
moved to reconsider the resolution, which
was done. That left the way open for
a new course, and Dr. Ruggles â¢ moved
that the local board be requested to put
a quarantine around Chinatown and pro
tect the sanitary condition of San Fran
cisco. The motion was carried. Dr. Crow
iey then turned to Dr. "Williamson and
Dr. Bazet and said: "Gentlemen, you
must have Chinatown quarantined this
evening and I think.it will be proper to
have the merchants present at your meet-
Ing to-night." i.
. ?
FEDERAL COURTS^
BLQCK THE WAY
Mr. Stubbs felt hurt that the Impres
sion had gone forth that the merohants
had impeded the work of the Health offi
cers. He therefore asked Dr. Kinyoun
whether he had been hampered In- his
work and that gentleman replied that he
had not: that he was actively engaged
in the discharge of his duty until the de
cision was handed down by the Circuit
Court enjoining him from proceeding fur
ther.
Mr. Baker of the firm of Baker & Ham
ilton added his voice to the requests made
by preceding speakers that a quarantine
outside the city should not be established.
Dr. Kinyoun was then called upon and
told of the orders issued by his superior
to employ inspectors and station them at
the depots and prevent Chinese from leav
ing the city unless having first been in
oculated. He was carryinc out the in
structions, but was enjoined at noon yes
terday by the Federal courts.
"At the present time. Dr. Kinyoun, you
are powerless." said Dr. Crowley.
"I have no power except to talk," said
the doctor, with a smile.
' A. I.. Scott wantpd to know why China
town was not quarantined. He thought.
If the law permitted it. It should be car
ried out. "Owing to the fact that there
has been plague in San Francisco," said
Dr Crowley. "and there was 'free inter
course with Chinatown we thought it
would be easier to prevent the Celestials
going to other counties."
"You will nre%-ent us traveling," inter
rupted Thomas.
"You are nota Chinese, Mr. Thomas."
tKe doctor replied. â¢ â¢
.""Then I'll b\Â» a poor white at the end
fcf the season Jf this quarantine goes on."
There having arisen a feeling among
some of the merchants present that ji
consulting board of .physicians be called
in before any action was taken in the
matter. Dr. Henderson of Sacramento
arose and said there was no need of a
consulting board. He said if the, local
Health Board needed advice tlie^ Stato
Board would come to its assistance. Dr.
Henderson won the approval of all pres
ent when he said that he was in favor of
quarantining the small space of China
town, and doing so that afternoon.
Acting President Crowley then called
upon Dr. W. F. Blunt, the Health Officer
of Texas, to express his opinion on the
course the board ought to pursue. ' The
Texas physician was loth to discuss the
subject. He said he had come to this city
to Pee what the situation is. He'said that
If the citizens litre would take such measl
ures as would lessen the danger of the
spread of the disease the people abroad
would have more confidence am! be better
satisfied. He'said that he traveled through
the city and had seen how the Chinese
mingle with the whites. He thought bet
ter precautions could be taken. In answer
to a question of Dr. Crowley. the visiting
Health Officer agreed that it would be best
to roni'ne the Celestials to one district.
Dr. Blunt Gives Advics.
her of Commerce, was Invited to address
the gathering and he said: "I fully in
dorse every pontlment expressed by -the
gentlemen who preceded me. I was pres
ent with the Board of Health 'some time
ago when the matter of a house to houfte
Investigation In Chinatown was discussed.
At that time I was in favor of such a
movement and stated that if th& police
force was not sufficient to call out ihe
.-.ate militia and if they were not suffi
cient we had plenty of United States
troop?. I have learned with pleasure that
a successful house to. house investigation
has been made. .Gentlemen, why dwell
on the damage to our commerce and iny
duFiries by the establishment of a quar
antine? It Is so evident that such a
course would brln? heavy loss that I
warn and be:? of you to consider the mat
ter carefully before you take definite ac
' tion. If a quarantine were placed on San
\ Francisco this community would feel its
. effects not for one month nor six months,
j but a whole year."
Dr. G. McNe'l! eaid he had nothing to
add to what had already been said, but
he suggested that bubonic plague victims
should he isolated In pesthouses as small
pox patients usually are. He advised a
house to house innpecticn and all Chinese
found to Â»e infected coulU be Isolated. HÂ»s
thought" there was no dar.irer of it being
carried GULÂ«iÂ£e the city. He said to ad
vertise to the world that wÂ»> had plague
would be a serious injury to California.
'I here fins been nu epidemic, he sain, anj
there is little danger of there being one
if proper precautions were taken.
Dr. Crowley announced- his opinion of
the locrtl Health Beard. He said ho be
liovpd its members to be gentlemen
cf integrity, and like Caesar's \vifÂ«
nbove suspicion: lie r.lÂ«;o Lad implicit
confidence in the!r judgment. He then
dwelt at Itcgth on thr opinion that he had
received from Dr. Kinyoun. who he said
was oonced>x! to be second to nono as a
bacteriologist. 1 as to the presence of
plague- In this city. He also secured the
opinion of Dr. Kellogg, the local bacteri
ologist. f.n<l tho St.ite Board of Health's
bacteriologist, which confirmed him in the
belief that plngue existed In <'h)natown
an<! precai:tlcrr> should be taken to pre
\ont Us spread. Continuing, he said: "1 =

think, gentlemen, that* you as business

The State Board of Health does not get
cr.e penny for -ts labors. In fact. It spend?
money for. traveling, more than the State
allows it."
Dr. F_ Ii. Dav. president of the F.oarÂ«i

the board. Ho paid ns long as thore was :

require neither microscopes, detectives nor
medical student? who never saw a case of the
disease in their lives to discover the same; and
whereas, the Board of Health in seeking to pro
hibit people of the "Chinese or Jaoanese race
from leavlnjr this city without first showing: a
certificate of inoculation is an absurd discrim
ination In view of the fact that many persons
of other nationalities are known to live in or
near the Chinese quarter who are just as liable
to be infected, and that while seeking; to keep
the Chinese and Japanese from leaving the city
there has been no attempt to keep them from
entering: the city at will: and. whereas, the
Board of Health haiÂ« not In any manner con
sulted or advised with this board In the prem
ises, but has left this board to get its informa
tion as best it may from unofficial sources;
and whereas, the circulation of reports alleging
that this city is plague-ridden works an injury
to the community which can hardly be esti
mated, and that at a time when the business
men are trying to take advantage of a season
of prosperity now open to us; therefore be it
RESOLVED, That it is the opin
ion of this Board of Supervisors that
there is not now and never was an
epidemic of bubonic plague in this
city, and that the members of the
Board of Health, by their repeated
and unwarranted declarations that
such plague has existed and is exist
ing, although they have absolutely
failed to substantiate their charge,
have placed themselves in a position
where they have forfeited the confi
dence of the people of this city and
of this Board of Supervisors, and for
that reason it is the opinion of this
board that the members of the Board
of Health should forthwith resign
their office, to the end that a new
board may be created which will
have the confidence of this Board of
Supervisors and of the community at
large, and should the members refuse
to resign as above, the Mayor is
hereby asked to use the powers con
ferred upon him by; the charter, that
the city may have a Board of Health
in which it can feel confidence.

FiLl^e news no longer has any effect, and

"V.-hiie the reports of a possible border

the Cubans put it. "the only civil depart- j

out to fie a jrigrantie fraud." The argu- i

WALL-STREET BROKERS
FORCED TO THE WALL
Seymour, Johnson & Co. Carried
Do-w-n. b7 the Price-McCor
mick Failure.
NEW YORK, May 23.â Seymour. John
son & Co.. stock, cotton, and grain bro
kers. No. 17 Broadway, announced their.
suspension on the New York Stock Ex
change, the Cotton Exchange and the Chi
cago Board of Trade this morning. The
street was not taken by surprise. The
rircn was known to have, been in trouble
last week when Price, McCorcsick & Co.
assigned, and though it sent word to the
Stoci Exchange on the drny of that fail
ure that it was all right, and though th*
message was read from the rostrum and
cheered on the lioor. bankers and brokers
called for more margins, until this morn
ing the firm gave up, closed its doors and
made an assignment to Alfred Hayes Jr.
Mr. Johnson made a statement in which
he said:
"Our losses are about equally divided in
the stock and cotton markets. Leaving
Ioan3 out of the situation, our liabilities
are not likely to exceed $2G0.0Â». The loans.
if counted among our liabilities, will add
up another SC5.UC0. They are well mar
gined and can be taken care of. Our capi
tal was about $300.1*). of which $2X1.000
was Mr. Webster's and the balance Mr.
Seymour's and mine. I included my Stock
Exchange sÂ«at among- the assets. Our
capital is plainly wiped out. I shall break
with Mr. Seymour. I hope to make good
every dollar and resume business on my
own account."
The firm of Seymour. Johnson & Co.
was organized In March, 1S39. by Freder
ick W. Johnson. Henry A. Seymour and
David Webster, the last a special partner
for $3Â»,000. They. like Price. McCormick
& Co.. went in for a wire business, and
though their connections were not so ex
tensive they were large and the nrm did
a big commission and speculative business
in cotton, wheat and stocks. It was cot
ton that broke them-
The banks of this city probablv hold or â¢
held, from two to three million dollars of
the firm'3 securities, bot many of these
as in the case of Price, McCormick & Co..
were put up at a time when interest rates
were higher than they are now and the
loans called in are doubtless thos*Â» whe~e
percentage of industrial collateral was
larger than the banks cared to carry.

No Recommendation as to Govern

WASHINGTON. ' May K.-Chairman
Tawney, from tho Committee on the St.

Louisiana purchase, to-day filed a report
without recommendation, but giving an
extended summary of details and pur
poses of the bill, with tables on the ex
tent of Government participation in ex
positions up to date. The substitute bill
reported differences only in a few of Its
provisions from the act to provide for
celebrating the four hundredth anniver
sary of the discovery of America by the
exposition at Chicago.
The report explains that the cumber
some national commission of 111 members
at* first proposed, has been reduced to
nine, to be appointed by the President and
with no alternate commissioners. The
great size of the Chicago commission and
alternates, the report, states, tended to in
terfere with rather than promote that en
terprise. To avoid a clash between local
and Government managers, a board of
arbitration adjusts all differences. The
matter of awards and of lady commis
sioners is left largely to the local man
agement.

MRS. LEWIS RUTHERFORD MORRIS, FORMERLY MISS CATHER- \
INE CLARK, DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM A. CLARK OF MONTANA.
THOMPSON'S SPRINGS, Utah. May 28.
âSeveral posses to-day started In pursuit
of the bandits who murdered Sheriff Ty
ler and Sam Jenkins last Saturday at Hill
Creek, fifty miles north of here.
It is learned to-day that men answering
the description of the outlaws passed
through here last Wednesday coming
from Moab. After the shooting they rifled
the pockets of the two dead men, knowing
that Day and others .would return to take
the bodies away. The outlaws let part of
their camping outfit remain to make the
rescuers believe they were still there.
The men stopped at Turner's cabin In
Hay canyon, eight miles north and twelve
east of the tragedy, and took Turner's
best horses. Before leaving the leader
said: "We are going up Hay canyon and
will cross the White River. Just'as soon
as we get some money we will pav you for
the horses, providing we ain't killed. One
thing is certain, we will never be taken
alive."
Much speculation is being Indulged in as
to who the outlaws are. Some think they
are the gang who killed the two Mormon
boys in Arizona last April. Bush Cas
sady. the Jones brothers and Harvey Cur
ry, alias Kid Curry, are believed to be
. ViSvP anB: - Ther e Â» s a standing- reward
of $3000 for the arrest of the latter for
robbing the Portland, Or., National Bank.
Turner is along with the posse headed
by Sheriff Preece. Day is with Sheriff
How-ell's party. Before leaving Sheriff
Preece wired Indian Agent Myton at Ver
nal, the authorities at Rock Springs.
Meeker. Colo., Sherman and Wallace, in
structing them to send out posses at once
and head off the outlaws. It is almost
certain that one or other of the posses
will come across the gang within the next
few days, when some lively shooting is
looked for.
Direction the Men Are Traveling Is
Known and Sheriff Preece Has
Taken All Possible Measures
to Surround Them.

minority report was accepted, recom

of the large audience, on motion of Dr.

attempt to take up the majority report
was frustrated by Bishop Fitzgerald rul
ing that It was not before the conference.
It Is not believed that any further at
tempt will be made to take the matter
up. Thus the conference, in effect, has
taken xio action in regard to the ban
placed upon certain forms of amusement.
CHICAGO, May 28,-Crlticlsm of Presi
dent McKlnley for his attitude ln regard
to Attorney General Griggs' interpretation
of the anti-canteen law was overwhelm
ingly voted down by the Methodist con
ference to-day after two hours of warm
debate. The matter was brought up by
the presentation of the report of the com
mittee on temperance, of which Samuel
Dickie, candidate for President on the
Prohibition ticket in 1S32, is chairman. The
majority report arraigned the chief mag
istrate severely, but the conference finally
adopted the minority report, which ex
cluded the paragraphs referring to the
President, but which, however, called
upon him to use his influence to secure
the passage of the new anti-canteen law
now pending before Congress.

CRITICISM OF
THE PRESIDENT
VOTED DOWN
The Klondike clean-up Is reported to be
over half finished and has been very satis
factory. While two or three thousand
men will leave. Dawson for Nome, almost
as many will come out via Upper Yukon
with gold dust they have been acquiring
during. last winter. The rush to Nome,
which at one time was expected to reach
at least 5000, has been greatly lessened
by the stampede of over 500 men to Koyo
kuk. Up to Thursday the steamers F. K.
Gustln, Sybil and Ori had also reached
Dawson from White Horse. They were to
start back as soon as they could load.
Many Klondikers are .preparing to float
down the Yukon In canoes and barges,
trusting to luck to get across to Nome.
TACOMA, May 28.â Within a week
Klondlkers should be arriving on Puget
Sound with mail and gold dust, provid
ing the ice on Lakes L,e Barge and Ben
nett has opened sufficiently to permit free
passage of steamers. The Flora and
Florence S. passed. Fort Selkirk May 21
and 22, loaded to the guards with return
ing Klondikers. The Flora had 134 aboard
and the Florence S. nearly as many. Be
fore the steamer Alkl left Skaguay Thurs
day a telegram had been received an
nouncing the arrival of the Flora at
"White Horse. Connecting steamers were
in waiting there to b,rlng the passengers
up the Yukon. It Is almost certain they
have reached Bennett and possibly Skag
uay before this time.
Telegrams from Dawson and Selkirk an
nounce that a regular rate war has been
started at Dawson between the smaller
steamer lines seeking business for Cape
Nome. Passengers wire suspicious of
them because they have no connections
which insure a transfer across from St.
Michael to Nome, ln consequence these
boats cut the rate to St. Michael from
tftOO to $Â£0 and $60. Larger boats offering
through connections to Nome were readi
ly getting $100. Tickets were being sold
by the wholesale agents of steamers yet
to arrive from the lower river. The steam
ers Augustine and Hancock were sched
uled'to leave for St. Michael Friday and
Saturday of this week.

vious import of the words employed by
Congress. There is undoubtedly some
force in the suggestion that in rewarding
officers and sailors who have sunk or.de
stroyed the enemy's vessels in a naval en
gagement it is not unreasonable that all
the difficulties of every kind with which
they were actually confronted should be
; taken into consideration. Eut that is a
matter which we cannot suppose was
overlooked by Congress."
Upon the question of policy the court
said:
"All genuine Americana recall with de
light and pride the marvelous achieve
ments of our navy in the memorable en
gagement at Manila. But this court can
not permit considerations of that charac
ter to induce it to depart from the estab
lished nilos for the Interpretation of stat
ute?. Nor can we allow our judgment to
be influenced by the circumstances that
Congress has recently repealed all stat
utes giving bounty to officers and sailors
of the navy for the sinking or destruction
hereafter in time of war of an enemy's
vessels, thereby, it may be assumed, indi
cating that in the judgment of the legis
lative branch of the Government the pol
icy of giving bounties to the. navy was not
founded in wisdom and should be aban
doned. This court has nothihg to do with
Questions of mere policy that may be sup
posed to underlie the action of Con
gress.".
The original claim of Admiral Dewey
and his sailors was about $400,000. The
Court of Claims reduced it to $3W,000. That
decision is sustained by to-day's decision.
The admiral's personal claim is reduced
from about 120,000 to about 510,000.
Chief Justice Fuller and Justices White
and " McKenna dissented. Ex-Secretary
Herbert, counsel for Dewey and his men,
filed a petition for a rehearing. '-;'-~
WASHINGTON, May 2S.â The Su
preme Court of the United
States to-day â¢ decided Admiral
Dewcy's bounty claim against
- the admiral's (Contention.. The
effect Is to deprive the admiral and the
men engaged with him at Manila of half
the amount claimed by them. Chief Jus
tice Fuller delivered a dissenting opin
ion, and Justices White and McKenna
also dissented. Â»
Justice Harlan rendered the opinion of
the court, which turned on whether the
words "superiority" or "inferiority" in
the statute have reference to support of
the enemy's vessels by land batteries,
mines and torpedoes.

SAN RAFAEL, May 23.â The politicians
of Mill Valley are preparing for the Fri
day election, of a School Trustee to take
the place of J. H, Mclnnes, whose term
expires. A great â¢ rivalry exists between
the downtown and the so-called hill peo
ple and both factions are -hard at work
making a house-to-house canvass of the
town in behalf of their respective candi
dates. The hill people are backing A. L.
House and the downtowns are putting
their faith in J. F. Tobin. The cau~e of
the intense interest taken in the election
is the disposition of the $10,000 raised by a
bond election held early in this month for
the purpose of erecting a new school
house. The; location. of the proposed
school is furnishing the bone of conten
tion. Mill Valley will have the school, but
the residents are asking, themselves where
will it be put, uptown or downtown.

Social and business circles of San Fran
cisco and Sioux City, Iowa, were treated
to a surprise yesterday when a telegram
arrived from San Jose conveying the fact
that Richard FeJix Armstrong of this city
had joined hearts and hands with Miss
Mary Lurena Follett, a society belle of
the Iowa city.
The marriage, the result of a pretty ro
mance, the friends of the young couple
say, was solemnized on May 23. Miss FoL*
lett that was and her mother, who resides
at the Berkshire in this city, vl6ited San
Jose on the 22d inst. They returned to
Mrs. Follett's home on the evening of that
date, and the following day Mr. Arm-
Strong and Miss Follett stepped off the
train at the San Jose depot. Taking a
carriage they drove to the home of Rev.
Burr M. Weedcn. From there they went
to Trinity Kpiscopal parish house, Â¦wit
nesses were summoned and Mr. Arm
strong produced his license to marry. On
the official document he gave his age as
31; his bride confessed to 22. Mrs. B. C.
l..ongdon and Miss I. Ixingdon took their
places beside the young couple, the words,
that made them man and wife were pro-/
nounccd and then began a Journey to
Bllthesdale.. Marin County, where Mr. and
Mrs. Armstrong have decided to pass their
honeymoon.
Mrs. Armstrong, in addition to her
beauty, is talented and the possessor of
a fortune in her own name. Sho arrived
in San Francisco from her'home at the be
ginning of the winter, and remained with
her mother at the Berkshire. Mr. Arm-
Strong ia employed by Shreve & Co., Jew
dcrs*
Mrs. Follett' said last evening that she
did not care to talk regarding the mar
riage of her daughter. She refused to af
firm or denv the rumor that the young
lady left a devoted nance in Sioux City.
Her only answer was, "I have nothing to
say. so can say nothing."

ST. LOUIS, May 28.â Alard Scheck, the
winner of the third race at the Fair
Grounds this afternoon was the only fa
vorite to score. The fourth event, a five
furlong sprint, I produced the sensational
event of the day. The well-known Cali
fornia-bred colt, Yellowtail, was an odds
on favorite and would have won but for a
careless act of Jockey Buchanan In the
homestretch. Ed L, 100 to 1, Yellowtail
and . Frank â¢ Bell . were lapped In the run
home from the sixteenth pole, with Yel
lowtail between the others. He was In
such a position Â¦ that he could not force
through and Buchanan could not use his
whip. Many thought that Yellowtail was
fouled, but Buchanan failed to claim a
foul. It was an exciting finish, with Ed L
a nose lti front of Yellowtail -and Frank
Bell a nose back. The track was fast and

Up to noon the track was in good shape,
but then there came a heavy rainfall and
spoiled all the chances of a contest in the
Derby. Hiram Scoggan scratched his en
try. Highland I^a<l and Florizar, and later
Kentncky Farmer was withdrawn. St.
Ivor had been scratched earlier in the day.
This left but one horse in the race. Lieu

tance, a mile and one-half, for the bis end
of the pur*e. Thus the famous Latonla
Derby of 1900 passed into history and
Lieutenant Gibson, the crack Western
three-year-old, remains unbeaten.

Virtually acknowledging their error, Jo
seph Cairn Simpson. M. F. Turpey. W.
J. Martin and K. H. Green, comprising
the stewards of the Western Turf Asso
ciation, restored the disgraced jockey to
all turf privileges yesterday.
Very soon developments showed that
HennessyTwas the "tool" of Lynch, train
er of the horse Hard Knot and others.
I-ater Hennessv was suspended at Oak
land track for a ride on the two-year-old
Lucidia, owned by Burns & Waterhouse.
When confronted with certain facts and
promised Immunity from punishment by
the California Jockey Club, Hennessy told
The stewards of that club his whole deal
ings with Lynch et al, and where he was
to l>e pronttd thereby.
The rrook*d work had all bÂ«r?n done at
Tanforan Park, and President Williams
of Oakland informed Secretary Green of
Tanfora^i that the confession of Hennessy
would be furnished provided the ollipals*
<>i latter Track would agree to abide by
the decision of the California Jockey Club
stewards.
The statement of the repentar.t rider
â¢was Bent to the Western Turf Associa
tion, when, to the surprise of all, the im
plicated persons were exonerated and
Ueoaessjr ruled oft the turf. This was
Dot Justice Jn the eyes of Thomas H. Wil
liams Jr. and he did not drop the thing
until he had secured the reinstatement of
He&nessy.
Honnessy came within an ace of involv
ing the California Jockey Club and the
Tanforan Association in a very knotty
controversy. When It reached the ears
of The o^:c:aU of the track across the bay
that a confederacy, supposedly headed by
â¢*l>anny" Lynch and Willie Martin, had
bwn Conned to bea.t the books, a watch
was set on this pair of worthies.
R'.crht is right in any country on the
flobe, and yesterday Jockey "Mike" Hen
nessey was reinstated by the stewards of
the Western Turf Association.

JOCKEY "MIKE"
HENNESSY IS
AGAIN IN LINE
Neill feels confident that his arm will
be ready to launch jolts, rips and smashes
on the night of the fight and he promised
to make Sam Pooler's protege unhappy.
He will work with a will and with the
idea of retrieving his forfeit money and
the long end of the purse.
Moffatt has rounded into condition. He
will keep up his road and gymnasium
work and will enter the ring to go the
route at a fast "clip."
The selection of Jack 'Welch is an as
surance that there will be a just decision.
Welch has given eminent satisfaction in
the roped arena and he says he will up
hold his reputation by rendering a proper
verdict.
Those financial troubles having: been ad
justed Jack Welch was accepted as ref
eree. Both men favored'Tiim and his
selection was made in short order.
As Xeill was unable to live up to his
contract Pooler demanded recompense
and cold-bloodedly drew down the
amount. This will not endear Pooler to
the local ring followers. In the past it
has always been the custom to waive the
forfeit money, but the Chicago fight man
ager overlooked^precedents.
Pooler not onlf took $125 of Neill's hard
earned money, but demanded and received
$00 from the club for extra training ex
penses. Manager Crowley was more gen
erous. He handed the remaining $75 to
Nelll and said, "Here, Al, take this money
and cure your arm." Nelll thanked the
Columbia Club for its courtesy apd then
looked daggers at Pooler and muttered,
"I will send you hoiyie a loser."
Neill presented a certificate signed by
Dr. Leonard which in effect stated that
the California;! was suffering from the
injured arm and was therefore unable to
contest. Pooler feigned disappointment,
and then made a demand for forfeit
money. He called attention to the fact
that Zeke Abrams. the poolseller. was
stakeholder and had In his possession the
sum of $250 deposited by both men as a
guarantee that they would appear on the
evening set down in the articles of agree
ment.
A meeting was held last night In a
downtown resort by the principals, their
managers and the club representatives.
The meeting was called at the request of
Manager Crowley of the Columbia Ath
letic Club, under whose auspices the mid
dle-weight contest is to be held, because
he had been apprised of the local man's
condition. Sam Pooler did the talking for
Moffatt. Nell] stated his own case and
Crowley spoke In behalf of the club.
Al Xelll and Jack Moffatt will not box
on Thursday evening. Their twenty-round
bout has been postponed until Friday
evening, June 8. The postponement was
made necessary by reason of Xelll's Ina
bility to enter the ring In fit condition to
make a proper showing against his famous
Chicago opponent. Neill's left arm. which
he injured in his bout with Australian
Tim Murphy, has caused him considerable
bother and anxiety. It Is due to his con
stant worrying over the injured member
that he Is unfit to do battle.

THE FRUIT GROWERS' COMBINE
San Leandro Reporter.
The San Francisco Call has devoted
much space to the controversy between
the growers and cannere during the past
week. The good work of The Call has
been appreciated by all . the growers In
this section 'and will not be soon forgot
ten. The following admirable editorial is
well worth reading:
By way of meeting the menace to their
industry caused by the combination of the
canncrs. the fruit-growers of Alameda
County have taken steps toward organiz
ing for the purpose of handling and
ning and marketing their fruit for them
selves whether it be or ever was the
purpose of the canners to wrong the fruit
growers does not in any way affect the
wisdom of the action thus^ taken, and I It
would be well for orchardlsts in other
counties to follow the example. .
-So far we know there has been no
movement, on the part of the cannera
combine to Injure the orchardists. and if
the leaders of the combine be wise there
never will bo such an intent on their part,
for unless frult-prowing be profitable the
industry will diminish and the canners
will lind themselves in the position of the
man who killed the goose that laid the
golden eggs. The large output of fruit
will* decrease and the ; canners will then
be unable to. obtain a sufficient amount
of â¢ it ; to compete with the rival . canners
in the East. . â¢ .
Conceding . the : best Intentions to the
canners. however,, it remains true that
orchardlsts -will be wise in organizing for
co-operative effort whenever . it may be
needed. 'V
The , very forces which have made it
advisable Â¦ for the canners to ' " combine
make it also advisable * for the growers
to combiner ~ .- .... Â¦ ' , :
.In the end It will probably be found ad-
The society editor of the Dally Bread,
who was acting temporarily as news ed
itor, worked over in this style a dispatch
referring td a battle: "General Walker
announces the engagement of Colonel
Thompson with a considerable .force of
the enemy yesterday afternoon. Colonel
Thompson will be at home within the
enemy's lines until exchanged."â Chicago
Tribune.
Proper Form.
It will be noted that the first section authorizes
Congress to define, regulate and control trusts not
only in the States, Territories and. the District
of Columbia, but "in all territory under the. sov
ereignty and subject to the jurisdiction of the United
Section 1. All powers conferred by this article shall
extend to the several State* Rnd Territories, the Dis
trict of Columbia and all territory under the'sover
eignty and subject to. the jurisdiction of the United
States. il-fix-i
Sec. 2. Conpreis Khali have power to define, regrulate,
control, prohibit or dissolve* trusts, monopolies or com
binations, whether existing in the form of a corporation
or otherwise. The several States may, continue to ex
ercise such power in any manner not in conflict with the
laws of the United States. . .' -.
Bee. 3. Congress shall have power to enforce the pro
visions of this article by appropriate legislation. Â¦ >i''->
REPORTS from Washington of 3'esterday. out
lining the probable course of Congress* are to
the effect that ?n adjournment will be taken as
early in June as possible and that in order to avoid de
lay no legislation other than the passage of appro
priation bills will be considered except the anti-trust
measures, which are regarded in the House as mat
ters of urgency. There are two of these measures,
one a bill in charge of Representative Overstreet
amending the Sherman law and the other a resolution
of the Judiciary Committee proposing an amendment
to the constitution conferring .upon Congress power
to deal with trusts and to pass laws for their regula
tion.
. The constitutional amendment is so much the more
important of the two measures that it completely
overshadows the other and occupies almost all the
attention given to the subject. As reported the pro
posed amendment declares:
THE 0NTI-TRUST AMENDMENT.
OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
STATISTICS issued by the Treasury Depart
ment for April show the exports of manufactures
were by far the greatest of any month in our
history and within a fraction of $40,000,000. "This." it
is said, "gives assurance that the exports for the fiscal
year which ends with June will considerably exceed
$400,000,000 and be nearly three times as much as a
decade ago. This phenomenal increase in the expor
tation of manufactures is especially striking when
compared with the progress made by European na
tions. Great Britain's export manufactures show a
slight increase since 1890 and an examination of the
export record of the principal European countries
fails to disclose an instance in which the increase has
been as much as 25 per cent, while that of the United
States has been more than 150 per cent."
In this showing of expanding trade there is one
defect. It is American trade so far as the goods go,
but it is not American when the question of transpor
tation is considered. As has been pointed out by Ray
Str.nr.ard Baker in his work, "Our New Prosperity/'
"the United States has a magnificent fleet of coastwise
and lake vessels, but the freights on its colossal for
eipn business go largely into the- pockets of foreign
shipowners. While we equal England in our exports
and far exceed any other nation, we have only about
one-fourteenth of the tonnage engaged in foreign
business. Germany. France and Norway are well
ahead of us. * * * Moreover the American ship
ping business is increasing little or none. It has
actually decreased since i860 and tlje increase since
1800 has been only 325.000 tons, whereas the merchant
navies of almost every other nation in the world have
increased very largely/'
No one who gives consideration to the growing
commerce of the United States can fail to perceive th;
need of an enlarged merchant marine. The splendid
figures which show our exports carry with them a
condemnation of the policy of leaving it to the ves
sels of other nations to transport them across the
ocean. We can never justly boast of American trade
until it is carried in American ships. Until it is so
carried the greater trade will mean a greater tribute
paid to foreigner*.
, the circulation^of â¢counterfeit dollars containing as
much silver as the genuine dollars implies that some
of the free silver fellows have abandoned all expecta
tion of electing Bryan and gone to work at free coiri
aee on their own hook.

An angry citizen, with more frankness than discre
tion, protests that the money which he pays as taxes
is being squandered by reckless city departments: \lf
this sort of criticism keeps tip even the' favorites of the
Mayor will be forced to the extremity of earning an
honest living. w :i: '
In refusing to recognize the right of extradition
Indiana and Kentucky appear to have made them
selves organized promoters of crime. What is vice
in one State is virtue in the other and the Governor
of Indiana apparently forgets that he^ no more than
others, is qualified to dodge assassin bullets.
Some^surprise has been created at the fact that a
Californian has won the distinction of being the cham
pion hammer-thrower of the world. If there is one
field in which California can justly claim pre-eminence
it is in the handling of hammer's. Proficiency in the
art seems to be the preliminary requisite for success in
every walk of life.
Memorial day will have this year deep and solemn
meaning to the people of San Francisco. Year after
year our citizens have honored the memory and paid
tribute of respect at the graves of American heroes.
But this year the people of San Francisco will gather
at the graves of their own soldier dead and for the
first time'in the history of this generation weep in
common sympathy and suffering over wounds of war

Not to Be Caught.
General Grosvenor was remarkably accurate in his prediction of the number
of delegates Major McKinley would have in the St. Louis convention. On Sep
tember 20. 1S96, he told the World that Mr. McKinley was certain of 27S electoral
vote? and might set S5 from States he classed as doubtful. He conceded but 70
to Bryan. Mr. McKinley received 271 votes, all from the States included In Gen
eral Grosvenor's claim of 278 votes.
"I concede Maryland "and Kentucky to the Democrats." said General Gros
venor recently, "and I am magnanimous enough to give them Nebraska, although
I am not sure that McKinley wiil not carry that State. Really It should be classed
ni doubtful. Bryan carried Kansas four years ago, but I do not think he will be
so successful this time, and I have classed Kansas as doubtful. AH this talk
about Indiana going Democratic is bosh.) Indiana is safely Â¦ Republican. The
Porto Rico tariff, about which there has been such a howl, is going to help out
there rather than hurt. And as for New York, South Dakota. Washington and
Wyoming, which some say are doubtful, they will be Republican."

CALIFORNIANS IN WASHINGTON
The decision that the act of the board was illegal
and invalid caps the climax of the bubonic scare. The
quarantine, xhich was uncalled for and would have
been ineffective had it been called for, which was ill
devised and unnecessary, was also a bit of presump
tion unwarranted by the law. Doubtless Mayor
Phc'an would now like to have authority to remove
Judge Morrow. Judge de Haven and Judge Hawley
in order to sustain his Board of Health, but that is
beyond his power. He can, however, rid the Board
of Health of the bunglers who have abused its au
thority and wrought an immense damage to the city
and did he have half as much regard for public wel
fare as he protested before election he would do so.
The decision of the Judge is to the effect that quar
antine regulations must be adopted by ordinance of
the Board of Supervisors and the same authority
must provide suitable rules and regulations on the
subject. In this case the Board of Health acted with
out legislative authority and moreover in adopting
regv.latior.s the board did not base them upon any
established distinction in the conditions that are sup
posed to attend the plague or the persons exposed to
its contagion, but directed them against a whole class
of the inhabitants of the city without regard to
whether they were affected by the supposed plague or
were exposed to it.
BY the decision given by Judge Morrow granting
an injunction to Chinese petitioners against the
Board of Health and the quarantine officers â a
decision concurred in by Judges de Haven and Ha.vley
â the Board of Health has been taught a lesson which.
it is to be hoped, the members will have a sufficient
understanding to appreciate and a sufficient common
sen^e to profit by. The decision informs the board
that it has no authority to go about setting up quar
antines upon certain sections of the city and forcing
the use of prophylactics upon certain classes of per
sons of its own motion. Thus it appears the board in
carrying out the scheme of causing a scare over the
bubonic piapue bungled in law, as well as in science,
and had as little legal right as sanitary reason to act
as it did.
LESSON FOR THE BO0RD OF HEALTH-
CHARLES H. GROSVENOR of Ohio, who made a reputation
f ~T as a political prophet In 1596 while acting as the statistician of the llc-
KL>Â» Klnley campaign and who has been the President's mouthpiece in the
IJouso, has just tipured out that Mr. MeKinley's re-election is absolutely
jÂ£B assured. He has given the New York World the first authoritative pre
diction of the campaign. .
General Grosvenor claims thirty-six electoral votes more than
necessary to elect, or just the number cast by New York.
Chairman Jones of the Democratic National Committee and Representative
Richardson, chairman of the Democratic Congressional campaign committee, say
events are not shaped yet and refuse to make any definite predictions at thl3
time, although both of them are confident that Mr. Bryan will be elected.
For purposes of comparison the actual results In 1SS6 are placed side by side
with Representative Grosvenor's forecast:
Concedes Kentucky, Maryland and Nebraska
to Bryan, but Claims Thirty-Six Electoral
Pluralityâ No Estimates From Democrats.

PERSONAL MENTION.
THE ECLIPSE AS IT IS PROCEEDING IN SOUTH AFRICA.
One of the notable features of the announcement is
that in the work of the session the faculty will be
strengthened by the addition of several lecturers from
outside the university. Dr. Frederick L. Burk, presi
dent of the San Francisco State Normal School, will
lecture during the first three weeks of the summer ses
sion on "The Development of the Nervous System in
Relation to the Problems of Education." Dr. C. C.
Van Liew, president of the Chico State Normal
School, will lecture during the last three weeks. Pro
fessor E. C. Sanford of Clark University will- offer a
course in "The Psychology of Child Study," or some
related subject. Associate Professor Clyde A. Duni
way of the Leland Stanford Junior University will lec
ture on "The History of England Since 1483" and
on "The American Revolution."
- The summer school has now become an important
part of university work. It is of incalculable advan
tage to teachers and others who are unable to prose^
cute university studies except during vacation. The
instruction given is far superior to any that has yet
been possible through any other form of university
extension. It is a genuine course of higher education
offered to earnest students and workers and will well
repay all who take advantage of it.
The advantages offered to students during the ses
sion are not to be confined to mental training. It is
announced that the handball and the tennis courts, the
cinder path and the athletic grounds, the gymnasium
and the university boathouse will be at the disposal
of the students for exercise. Nor does the prospectus
fail to direct attention to the many advantages of
Berkeley as a place of summer residence, where the
coolness of the climate and the beauty of the sur
rounding hills render long walks and bicycle rides as
attractive as they are healthful.
The prospectus announces that during the session,
which will extend from June 25 to August 3, "courses
will be offered in philosophy, pedagogy, history and
political science, the Semitic languages and literatures,
Greek, Latin, English, mathematics, physics, chem
istry and botany. The work may count toward a de
gree. The summer students will have the full privi
leges of the libraries and museums and of the physical,
chemical and botanical laboratories. The faculty will
be strengthened by the addition of several special lec
turers. The tuition fee will be $10, regardless of the
number of courses taken, with laboratory fees in
scientific courses."
THE SUMMER SESSION flT BERKELEY
IZIJROM the prospectus of the course of instruction
prepared for the summer session of the Univer
sity of California it is evident the usefulness of
the institution to the cause of education will be well
nigh as great during the summer months as at any
other time of the year. The great plant, with its
libraries, laboratories, museums and lecture halls, is
not to be locked up and, left unused by students. It
is now to serve those who cannot use it at other
times and it is reasonable to assume there will be
many who will profit by the service.

If the German-born citizens of this country hive to
fight their relatives in Germany they want a reason
for it which is based on the great interests and su
preme welfare of their adopted country. They are a
highly intelligent people, not easy to- stampede and
have a quick insight into shams and false pretenses.
The Republican party cannot do better than disavow
administration responsibility for Senator Lodge's un
ripe and feather-headed declarations.
When Mr. Cleveland gave its most virile interpre
tation to the Monroe doctrine it was to check an
attempt by Great Britain to occupy by force the strip
of territory claimed by her and also by Venezuela. He
simply demanded that the title be arbitrated and not
settled by force, and we would have been justified in
fighting Great Britain had not Salisbury surrendered
by conceding arbitration after he had refused it. We
were willing that Great Britain should have all that
she could prove" title to, but would have resisted her
acquiring a single inch by force, because that would
have been the extension in this hemisphere of a
European system, by arms.
If England chose by treaty to convey British
Guiana to France we have no veto in the principles
of the Monroe doctrine. Nor would we have, if in
?. war between the two nations, she should seize
French Guiana as a conquest. These things appear
so plain that there is little patience with a Senato
of Lodge's supposed acquirements when he belches
war over the transfer of territory from one European
system to another. We do not exaggerate when we
say that such fool talk drives more votes from the
Republican party than Bryan can coax away, though
he pipe with the pipes of Pan and the sorcery of the
The Monroe doctrine arose in the attempt of the
Holy Alliance to aid Spain in the recovery of her re
volted colonies in this hemisphere. At the sugges
tion of Lord Canning, who had secret information of
the treaty of the Holy Alliance, Monroe, in a mes
sage to Congress, said that any attempt to extend
European institutions in this hemisphere would be
considered an act unfriendly to the United States.
This meant only that territory which by revolution
had been separated from European systems should not
be again subjected thereto. It in no way forbade the
transfer of territory from one European system to an
other, for that would not be in any just sense an ex
tension of European institutions.
We do not hesitate to say that Senator Lodge's
conclusion, that the purchase of the Danish West
Indies by Germany would be a breach of the Monroe
doctrine, has no warrant in any fair and natural con
struction of that doctrine.
Senator Lodge, all unmindful of this, felt called
upon to interpret the statement of the Secretary and
has declared that it referred to the breach of the
Monroe doctrine by a supposed negotiation for the
purchase of the Danish West Indies ' by Germany.
His conclusion is that we have the right under the
Monroe doctrine to forbid such sale. A Presidential
election is approaching, and besides the unwarlike dis
position of all our people, we have several millions of
German .citizens who, though loyal and patriotic,
will inquire very intelligently into the reasons given
for making war on their fatherland. If such war were
necessary and useful to this republic they would fight
in it with courage and great devotion to their adopted
flag against that under which they were born. But
they would consider such a war, brought on
with no good reason, as a plan to make this country
wreak on Germany the wrath of Great Britaili against
a rapidly rising commercial and military rival.
Senator Lodge is now in company with those who
attack Senator Hoar for harming the administration,
but every keen observer of events knows that the ad
ministration has been hurt only by its fool friends.
The speech o.f Senator Beveridge'did more harm than
has'been wrought by all the Democratic Senators in
concert, and just as its bad effects were being forgot
ten Senator Lodge is at the front with something
worse. Secretary of War Root was moved by some
after-dinner inspiration to say that we must either
fight for the Monros doctrine or abandon it. This
country is not avid of war. It is not forgotten that
early in the civil war, though the Union was at stake,
enlistments had to be encouraged by bounties and
finally the ranks had to be filled by conscription.
There are evidences abroad that there is much weari
ness with the war we have on now and that the peo
ple are going to demand ample reasons for looking
elsewhere for another war and mofc trouble.
SENATOR. LODGE of Massachusetts has a
reputation as a historical writer, a student,
scholar and thinker. He has had ample oppor
tunity to acquire, also, a reputation as a statesman,
which he has failed to improve. He is singularly
inapt in his utterances as a Senator and has no appre
ciation of the present crises, no matter how accurately
he may judge those of the past in'his character as a
historian. He has joined the critics against his col
league. Senator Hoar, who has at least the merit of
consistency, since he took a stand against expansion
and has abided by it, while Lodge took the same po
sition and has abandoned it without answering the
reasons he gave for his antagonism. In a long run
of a decade. a public man may double on himself, but
the people get tired of him when he doubles every
few months.
LODGE AND THE MONROE DOC
TRINE.
The attitude of the Democrats -toward the resolu
tion is curious. The leaders of that party have for
years past declared thai trusts should be regulated by
Congress and Bryan has been loud in promising the
people what he would do if elected President and
given authority to deal with trusts. Now, however,
there is confusion in the camp. Since the Repub
licans have shown a willingness and an ability to grap
ple with the trust problem the Democrats have sud
denly discovered that the thing is dangerous. Some
of them assert the resolution is a trick devised to rob
Bryan of his campaign thunder, and others declare the
amendment will violate State rights and deprive the
State governments of authority over corporation char
ters. In fact the Democrats d&sired the anti-trust
issue to remain open as a subject for vague declama
tion and denunciation and the action of the Repub
licans in giving a definite form to the issue has found
the Bryanites incapable of agreeing among themselves
how to deal with it. rj'/J: \
The argument for the amendment Â¦ is that experi
ence has proven that a proper regulation of trusts
cannot be effected by separate State action. The evil
i3 national and the remedy must be -national. It is
claimed by members of the Judiciary Committee that
the second section, which contains the essential part of
the amendment, does not introduce any. new prin
ciple of government, but is only a new application and
an amplification of the principle involved in the in
terstate commerce law and that therefore the amend
ment is not to be regarded as in any way a radical
departure from the recognized scope of Congressional
action.
States." The phrase is clearly inteaded to include
such colonial possessions as the country has acquired
or may hereafter acquire, and to put an end to: any
controversy concerning the right of Congress to legis
late under the proposed amendment for such posses
sions. This is therefore something new in thejan
guage of the constitution if not in law and will doubt
less be one of the most generally discussed features of
the resolution.

A "Knocker's" Mistake.
Linuls Victorson was convicted by Judge
Cabaniss yesterday of petty larceny. Ho
Robbery Not Proved.
Frank R. Dunn and John Gilchrist,
charged with robbery, had their cases dls
mlsed by Judge Mogan yesterday. They
were accused of forcibly taking $21 50
from Wing Chung, a Chinese laundryman,
also known as "Jim Murphy." There was
no evidence to corroborate the Chinese,
and as both defendants, who are hard
working young men, denied committing
the robbery, the judge gave them the
benefit of the doubt.
FRESNO RATE CASE IS
CALLED FOR ARGUMENT
Southern Pacific Company Endeavors
to Escape Result of Its Compet
ing Schedule.
The right of the Southern Pacific Com
pany to arbitrarily raise rates and fares
without permission of the Railroad Com
mission was an issue before Judge Bahrs
yesterday. The action by which the peo
ple, on the relation of E. B. Edson, seek
an injunction restraining the corporation,
from raising the rate of passenger fares
between this city and Fresno from $3 75
to J3 9U was argued. Attorney-General
Ford, George A. Sturtevant and Frank 11.
Short appeared for the petitioner and the
defendant was represented by J. E.
Foulds, with John Garber as counsel.
Attorney-General Ford, after setting
forth the facts of the controversy, quoted
from the constitutional provisions estab
lishing the commission, and pointed to
that particular section which specifically
prohibits common carriers from again
raising their rates without permission of
the Railroad Commission after the same
have been reduced for the purposes of
competing with other lines. The object
end wisdom of this provision, he said,
was plain. It was enacted for the pur
pose of preventing rich and powerful or
ganizations from crushing out those less
fortunate and then, when competition was
dead, again raising the rates. "We are
not here," said Mr. Fcrd, "that your
Honor may decide the merits of the con
troversy. We only ask that your Honor
will enforce tho Judgment of the Railroad
Commission which is now on record."
; An Ingenious response was made by the
corporation lawyers to Mr. Ford's argu
ment. Mr. Foulds said that the Southern
Pacific had been denied the right to Intro
duce evidence to show the reasonableness
of the V> 90 rate. The reduced rate of J3 75,
he said, was only an excursion or commu
tation rate, and although It prevailed for
two years It In no way took precedence
over the $3 90 rate, which always stood In
abeyance but which was not nullified by
the excursion rate. He then cited from the
constitution various provisions which he
held qualifiedâ that section under which
the action of the Railroad Commission
was taken. Argument was still in prog
ress at the hour of adjournment and the
court ordered a continuance until this
morning. . .

ISLAM TEMPLE SHRINE
TO AID MASONIC HOME
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
long-looked-for British bark^Musselcrag.
She was 313 days coming here from Ant
werp via the Cape of Good Hope and
Sydney, N. S. W. It took her ninety-two
days to come from the latter port, and the
consignees and owners were beginning to
wonder what was wrong with her.
The Musselcrag sailed from Antwerp on
Juiy IS, with 18.13S barrels of cement and
a quantity of sulphur, mineral water,
mustard, gin, olive oil and tapers. On
September 10 she was off the Horn and
making heavy weather of it. Early in Oc
tober she was sighted off Staten Island by
the Blackbraes, and on that date she gave
up the struggle and started to make her
way to San Francisco by way of the CapÂ©
of Good Hope. During her rtght with the
elements the Musselcrag was completely
swept by the heavy seas. Everything
movable on deck went overboard and the
poop companionways were smashed into
kindling wood. The bulwarks were stove
in. cabin flooded, galley gutted and the
sailors' things were washed out of the
forecastle. Nearly a whole suit of sails
was blown away and the running rigging
was considerably damaged.
On January 4 last the Musselcrag was
off Cape Otway, Australia, and Captain
Johnson signaled the life-saving station.
Eight days later Sydney, N. S. W.. was
reached, and there the bark was over
hauled and repaired. It was February 23
before she was ready to resume her voy
age, and as the hull was very foul from
being so long in the water It took her
ninety-two days to make the run here.
As Sydney, N. S. \V., is an infected port
the Musselcrag was placed in quarantine
by Dr. Klnyoun, but the chances are that
she will be released to-morrow.
The British ship Amazon arrived from
Kobe, Japan, and was also placed In
quarantine. She comes in ballast and
made a splendid passage of twenty-six
days across the Pacific. The Amazon will
load wheat here for Europe.
Were Quietly Wedded.
Without letting any of their friends
know anything about it. Captain Henrlk
Johannissen of the schooner Gotama and
Mrs. Regina T. Madison were quietly mar
ried last week at the home of the bride.
2326 Mission street.. Mrs. Johannissen was
the wife of the late Captain Madison, who
in his lifetime was managing owner of a
fleet composed of over a dozen coasters.
Captain Johannissen is well known in San
Francisco, and It is rumored that when
he comes back from his honeymoon he
will retire from the sea and look after
his wife's interests ashore. If he should
make a few more voyages It will be a3
master of a much larger and finer vessel
than the Gotama.
Vessels for Nome.
The Kimball Steamship Company's Noyo
is to sail for Nome to-day at 5 p. m. All
her passenger accommodation Is taken
and every ounce of freight she can carry
will ro away on her.
The brig Geneva has been chartered by
the Standard Oil Company and will take
a load of kerosene to the gold Helds.
A big gang of carpenters Is working
night and day on the steamer Newsboy,
and she will be ready to start for Nome
on June 2. All her deckhouses will be on
to-day and she will then dock at Mission
street wharf to clean and paint. Friday
she will beÂ«ln to load and Saturday after
noon she will sail for Nome.
On Saturday the .^Alaska Commercial
Company will sendtmt the San Jose and
the Alaska Exploration Company will dis
patch the Humboldt. Both are splendid
ocean steamers and will take away big
crowds of fortune hunters.
Movements of Warships.
The United States cruiser Philadelphia
Is being overhauled In a hurry at the
navy-yard, and the chances are that she
will be sent Into Japanese waters as soon
as her repairs are completed. The Con
cord and Bennlngton were to have come
home from the China station, but the or
der has been countermanded and they
will remain in the Orient. Both vessels
require overhauling, but the work will be
done at Hongkong. The Concord and the
Bennlngton are light-draught vessels and
are very serviceable either In .China or
the Philippines. For this reason the order
to come home was countermanded.
Hindostan's Hard Luck.
McCulloch Sails for Seattle.
The Chilean ship Hindostan has been
burned at sea, according to advices re
ceived by the Merchants' Exchange, and
the crew, after much privation, haa
reached Tahiti. The Hindostan left Port
Blakeley on December 8, 1899, with a ldad
of lumber for Valparaiso. She was caught
In a storm off the Columbia River and put
in here leaking on January 8. 1900. she
was repaired and sailed again for Val
paraiso on February 8. Now comes the
news that the ship took fire the latter
part of and the crew had to aban
don her. After being eleven days In the
open boats the men reached the Marque
sas and from there were taken to Papeete,
Tahiti. From Tahiti they will probably
be taken to Australia on the mail steamer
and from Sydney, N. S. \V., will be sent
home.
The United States revenue cutter Me-
Culloch sailed for Seattle yesterday af
ternoon. From there she will carry a
year's supply of stores to St. Michael, for
the Xunivak, the United States special
boat. for patrolling the Yukon. The. Mc-
Culloch is to then return to 'Seattle,
where she will take on the officers of the
United States Court of Alaska, who will
be landed' by her at Nome.

BOUKOFSKY IS
ARRAIGNED IN
POLICE COURT
*
His Preliminary Hearing Is
Set for Saturday
Next,
t
Clash. Between Chief Sullivan and
the Bond Clerk as to the Small
Amount of Prisoner's
'BaiL
Â«
E. N. Boukofsky the policeman
charged with an assault with a deadly
weapon, was arraigned befor-j Judge Mo
gan yesterday morning. He was repre
sented By Attorney Percy V. Long. By con
sent the case was continued till Saturday.
It was originally intended to have Special
Officer Helbush. at whom Boukofsky fired
a shot, swear to the complaint, but owing
to his change of front in not being posi
tive as to Boukofsky's identity he was
not called upon. P. O. Drlscoll, the grip
man who was threatened with a revolver
by Boukofsky In the vacant lot at Jack
ecn ar;(i.Lyon streets, swore to the com
plaint. *
Chief Sullivan complained to Warrant
and Bond Clerk I'cery yesterday morning
as to one of his assistants having fixed
Boukofsky's ball at the small sum of JoO
cash. Peery contended that the police
had no riÂ£;ht to interfere in regard to the
question of bail, as the District Attorney
was responsible under the charter for all
bonds and that the person who ordered
Boukofsky's rearrest after being released
on Judge Dunne's order should be arrest
ed for lalse imprisonment.
"1 am the person responsible, said the
Chief, "and if that la your view you can
have me arrested."
Judge Cabaniss was present at the con
troversy and he said that In his opinion
$."Â¦0 was inadequate. He said he wipuld as
sume the .responsibiiltv of making the
bPil $230 cash and the Ch!ef was satisfied.
Boukofsky's friends put up the additional
J2>j and he was released.
"I propose." said the Chief later, "to
have this matter of fixing small ball in
felony "Cases stopped. . In Boukofsky s
case It was an outrage, as he was a police
officer and was all the more culpable. I
could have preferred other charges
against him. and would have done so if
the bail had not been increased. I do not
want to come into collision with any other
department of the municipality, but pome
arrangement must be made for providing
adequate ball in felony cases and I pro
i pose to see that It is done."
Bond Clerk Peery said that the man who
put up the $00 cash bail for Boukofsky
could have with as much ease have put
up bonds for $100,000, and as he held him
self personally responsible for Boukof
skv's appearance in court the $50 was
enough. The charter gave him the power
to fix bail and the police had no right to
interfere, he said.
Legal Point Mad* Against the Mag
dalen Asylum Was Not r '-Â¦:Â¦-_,
Settled.
The habeas corpus case of Mattle Wyck
off in connection with which the point
was , raised that commitments could
not legally be made to the Mag
dalen Asylum, suddenly terminated
yesterday In the Supreme Court,
the attorneys agreeing to have the
matter dismissed and the girl given Into
the custody of her^mother. Mattle Is but
13 years of age, but her associates have
been of the very worst kind, and she was
8O depraved that Police Judge Mogan con
victed her of vagrancy and decreed that
she should remain In the Magdalen Aay
lum until she attained her majority. Her
mother tried to secure the release of her
child through habeas corpus proceedings.
Attorneys Hugh Grant and H. J. Custer
took up the case and announced their In
tention to atack the commitment on the
â¢ground that the asylum is a private in
stitution,-and that the Judge had no right
to send the girl to such a place.
Attorneys Matthew Sullivan and Theo
dore Roache represented the institution
and claimed to be able to show that It
was really the old industrial school, or
at least the female branch of it, and that
the legislative act of 1S74 contained all
of the provisions of previous acts and le
galized those of the Board of Supervisors
relating to the same matter. Mr. Sullrvan.
stated that the sisters at the Magdalen,
Asylum were not sorry to get rid of the
girl, as she was corrupting the other In
mates of the Institution.
WYCKOFF CASE ENDS

One Hundred Quests Sit Around the
Board and Listen to Informal
Speeches.
The Knights of St. Patrick, with wives,
sisters and lady friends, banqueted last
night at the Occidental Hotel in honor of
the Installation of the new officers of the
order. About one hundred In all were
present. Â¦ :
Speeches of an informal and extempora
neous nature were made after the serving
of an elaborate dinner.
The newly elected officers were called
upon for short addresses. They are R. C.
O'Connor, who Is serving a second term
as president; J. A. Emery, vice president;
James K. Cosgrove, second vice president;
James F. O'Brien, recording secretary;
P. F. McCorraack, financial secretary:

Friends of Joe Sullivan of the LJebes
Fur Company are exchanging gossip
about an alleged marriage he Is supposed
to have gone through in Marin County.
Could they read between the lines their
sorrow would be turned to laughter, and
any suspicions they might entertain of
rashness 6n Sullivan's part would vanish
like ice cream at a church bazaar.
Bright and early Saturday morning Sul
livan and George Gallagher, the well
known politician, crossed the bay to San
Rafael. Their aim was pleasure. Before
the day was over they had it â not exactly
in the way they expected, however. As
they stepped off the train they bumped up
against Attorney Joe Hawkins of Lennon
& Hawkins and Attorney Magee. After a
few words of greeting the two San Rafael
attorneys began to ask the visitors what
had brought them over. Now, Sullivan
and Gallagher are known as staid citizens.
To say they had sought Marin on pleasure
bent seemed a frivolous excuse for their
presence in San Rafael. In reply to
Hawkins' rapid-ttre questioning Gallagher
gave out that business, had caused them
to leave their happy homes. Hawkins and
Magee were at their service. Where did
they want to go? They didn't know San
Rafael. The two natives would pilot them.
Gallagher and Sullivan began to per
spire. This was getting serious. Some
thing had to bo done. To say that the
business only existed in their minds sa
vored of weakness. No. they had fabri
cated, and they would stick to It, come
what might. Â» M â â
"Well-ah, really, you know, fellows,
said Sullivan, "this is a delicate affair.
We can manage It all right by ourselves.
Oh, no; Magee and Hawkins couldn t
think of such a thing. Leave two
strangersâ guests, so to speakâ to Una
their way alone! Besides, of course, they
didn't want to seem curious, out really,
between friends, you know."
Here Gallagher threw himself valiantly
into the breach. Really he didn t like i toâ
but then he knew It would go no further.
Well, to make a clean breast of it, they
had come over to get Sullivan a marriage
license. Sullivan shied at being made the j
scapegoat of the explanation, but he bore
up nobly, and in answer to the San Ka
faelltes' congratulations distinctly smiled
~Magee y and Hawkins. In high delight,
piloted their San Francisco friends up to.
Cupid Graham's sanctum.
â¢â¢What's her name?" whispered Sullivan
to Gallagher, when Graham put the
momentous question. âÂ»,â.
"Mamie Riley." returned Gallagher,
turning to Magee and Hawkins and tell
ing them how affectionate and domestic
his friend was and what a model husband
he would make. Sullivan writhed in
agony and tried to land a furtive kick on
Oallagher. but he missed his mark and
ruined several square inches of varnish
on the desk.
"Funny, the way love affects some
men," whispered Gallagher to Magee.
â¢â¢You'd think Joe was crazy. Just love,
that's all."
Bv this time the fateful paper. was pre
pared and neatly done "P in a roll. Sulli
van, who was getting nervous, threw
down $5 and rushed out without waiting
for change. Outside Magee and Hawkins
expressed a wish to see the young lady.
"She's out at Fairfax wating for Joe, '
said Gallagher.
"We'll- got a rig and all go out to
gether." said Hawkins.
"And Hawkins and I will order the best
dinner in the land in honor of the bride
elect." put in Magee.
Ten minutes later the quartet were
bowling along the road to Fairfax. When
thev ncared the place where the bride
was supposed to be waiting Gallagher be
gan to break the news gently to Magee
and Hawkins. After some deep thinking
the Marin natives began to tumble. The
Josh was on them. Â£
"Well we'll have the dinner all the
same," said Magee. "Only I guess we'll
make It stag."
And this is the truth of the romantic
story that Joe Sullivan had run away to
San Rafael with a beautiful girl and got
married. His many young lady friends
who have been filled with the gossip of it
will perhaps be pleased when they learn
that the "marriage" never got any fur
ther than the taking out of a license bear-
Ing the name of a fictitious bride, and
that Joe is really a bachelor yet.

DETROIT, Mich., May 28.â Foreign* mis

annual reports submitted to-day, by the
officers of the American Baptist Mission
ary Union showed that the union has to
day in foreign countries 472 American mis
sionaries, 2480 native preachers and other
workers, 595 self-supporting native
churches and 1507 out stations. The so
ciety's debt on April 1 last had increased
in nn? year from $54,400 to $111,000.
ThÂ© number of additions to the native
churches by baptism, have been unprece
dr;ntedly great in most of the foreign
fields. In the Congo mission this has
reached almost 50 per cent- of the mem

LONDON, May 28.â Replying in 4he
House* of Commons to-day to a question
on the subject of Saturday's naval ex
periment, when the British first-class bat
tleship Majestic fired upon and sank the
coast defense ironclad Belle Isle near
Portsmouth in nine minutes, the First
Lord of the Admiralty. George J. Goschen,
said that to the extreme surprise of the
naval men the Belle Isle did not take fire,
although she was reported to have been
in flames six minutes after the firing com
menced. He explained that the specta
tors, heing at a distance from the war
ship, were misled by volleys of steam
and lyddite smoke.
Mr. Goschen added that there was a
slight smoldering in one cabin of the Belle
Isle, but that otherwise the woodwork,
although shattered In every direction, was
not consumed by fire to- any decree. The
experiment was Instituted specially to see
whether the woodwork of the Belle Isle
would burn as the woodwork of the Span
ish ships destroyed*by tho American ships
had burned. . ;

"The Chamber, approving the act of
the Government and confident of the de
votion of the army to the fatherland and
the republic, passes to the order of the
day."
- Tils motion M. Bourgeois supported In
a speech, appealing- to the Republicans to
un'te In the defense of the republic against
"a party which, in the name of national
ism, is working perpetually, either openly
or underground, to brine about the de
struction of the republic"
"It Is not only the republic which Is
threatened." he scld; *'it is the parlia
mentary institution. It is liberty itself."
The i'irft part of the motion of Bour
ireois, "approving the net* of the Govern
ment " was adopted by 2S8 votes against
247. and the eccor.d was Fasred unanl
mouply.

"WASHINGTON, May 28.â This was a
dull day in the House, considering the
near approach of the final adjournment
"The Alaskan civil government ,l>ill was
passed and some odds and ends of legis
lation were cleaned up.
Dalzell gave | notice that the anti-trust
resolution and bill reported by the Judi
ciary Committee would bo considered on
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this
week under a special order.
"Wednesday is Decoration day," sug
gested Richardson-. "It is usual to ad
journ over on that day."
"I do not think we can better, observe
the day," replied Dalzell, "than by devot
ing it to the public business."
The House then resumed the considera
tion of those portions of the Alaskan civil
government bill which had been passed
over last week. During the debate Driggs
of New York, who raised something of a
sensation about two months ago by charg
ing reckless extravagance in fitting up
the transport Sumner, recurred to that
subject. Hince then he has continued his
Investigating tho cost of the retlttlng of
that transport, and to-day he charged that
$632,000 was .Â«pent upon her, her original
coat being $160,000. The Secretary of "War
reported that only $262,000 had been ex
pended in refitting. Driggs said that $100,
000 was expended by the Navy Department
before she was turned over to the War
Department. Â«
Senate Joint resolutions -were passed to
authorize the President to appoint ten
first lieutenants of the Signal Corp3,
whose commissions shall expire on June
30, 1901; and to provide for six additional
officers In the subsistence bureau of the
War Department.
Bills were passed to ratify the agree
ment of the commission to the five civil
ized tribes and the Semlnole Indians; to
restore to the public domain a small tract
of the White Mountain Apache Indian
Reservation In Arizona; to exchange gold
bars for gold coin.

Lodge Refutes the Charges.
Lodge of Massachusetts: "What proof
has the Senator of a secret understanding
between the United States and Great
Britain?"
Wellington replied that he would reach
that point later, but soon closed his
speech without reference to tho matter.
Lodge thereupon said ho had listened In
vain for any proof of an understanding,
Secret or otherwise, between this country
and .Great Britain. ,
Wellington replied that naturally there
could be no tangible pr,oof of 'such an
understanding until the secret archives
of the State Department were opened.
"Then It comes back simply to this,"
said Lodge. "The Senator believes a se
cret understanding exists. The fact- is
there is no such understanding. Under
our system of government It could not
exist. The Secretary of State, nn honor
able and patriotic man, has denied that a
secret alliance or understanding oxlsts. I
believe him and the American people Co
and will believe him."
The Boer resolution then went over.
The Senate resumed consideration of the
sundry civil appropriation bill. Tho read
ing of/the bill was completed.'but not all
of Hfc/ committee amendments have been
dJrposed of. A lively debate wa3 precip
itated over tho proposition to continue the
life of the Industrial Commission .until
October 31. 1901. Charges were mada that
the commission was being used ns a Re
publican campaign machine and that im
portant testimony had been suppressed.
The committee amendment, however, waa
agreed to. j.
He declared that this country', so far as
its government was concerned, had yield
ed to Rrltish blandishments and was un
der the sway of British Influence. Eng
land dared not. hÂ» said, attack us by
force, and. realizing this, was gaining
points against us by diplomacy. So it was
during the Kispano-American war that
England professed herself our friend after
we had broken the power of Spain.
"That," he exclaimed, "was the begin
ning of an alliance conceived in darkness
and carried out in iniquity. There has
been between the two governments a se
cret understanding â although as yet no
open alliance â and a surrender of Ameri
can interests to Great Britain. Despite
the desire of a vast majority of our peo
p' e ; that we should extend our sympathy
and good offices to the Boers, the dlplom
acy of Great Britain now binds the hands
of our country."
Wellington discusseed at length the
origin of the pending war, and declared
thct what Great Britain was unable
ethervise bring about she accom
plished by "misrepresentation and libel."
He denounced England for what he de
clared v.-as- its policy of aggression
against the Boers in driving them from
place to place, each of which had been
purchased by the money of the Boers and
baptized with their blood- The treaties
between the Boers and Great Britain
were violated, because, he maintained,
"England never kept a promise where It
was to her advantage to break It."
"England had determined to gain pos
session of the rich gold mines of rthe
Transvaal," said Wellington, "and the
conspiracy organized by Cecil Rhodes and
Joseph Chamberlain soon developed Into
one of the most awful tragedies of mod- 4
c-rn times."
He declared the United States Govern
ment need have no fear of acting In the
matter, as Great Britain would not go to
war with the United States, and the
i United States Government should give the
Boer envoys the same cordial welcome as
had been extended to them by the people
of the country- But this reception was
â¢ being withheld by the Government be
! cause of an understanding between this
I Government and Great Britain.
WASHINGTON. May 2S.â In the course,
cf a Epeech to-daj- in favor of the adop
tion cf a resolution expressing the Sen
ate's syr.-ipr.thy for the Boers. Wellington
of Maryland referred to a secret uudÂ«r
stocdins existing between the. United
States and Great Britain. When Lodge
of Massachusetts demanded proof that
such an understanding existed, Welling
ton said that under the circumstances it
was ditiicuit to present tangible proor,
but he believed the proof could be found
in the secret archives of the State De
partment. Mr. Lodge replied that under
our iorm of government no such under
â¢tanding eouiti exist, and, as the Secre
tarv of dtate had emphatically denied the
exiiter.ee of any alliance or understand
ing, he believed the country would accept
his statement as true.
Wellington, in calling up Teller's reso
lution expressing sympathy for the Boers
and declaring- a desire that the govern
ment of tho United States should extend
its friendly offices to both Great Britain
and the Transvaal with a view to bring
ing the war to a close, maintained that
Congress would not have performed the
full measure of its duty if before adjourn
ment it did not redeem its pledge to give
the people of Cuba a free and independ
ent government; if it did not declare its
policy as to the Philippine Islands, to the
holding of which by the United States
he was unalterably opposed, and if it did
not take definite action in favor of the
Boers. The American people, he said,
were in profound sympathy with the
Boers, who were struggling for liberty
ags.ir.st untold odds.
â¢Unless we v.ish to be recreant to our
duty we must act," he exclaimed, "and
unless we act quickly it will be too late."

Alliance. .
Accusations Made in a Speech on Be

. Special Dispatch to The CalL
BOISE. Idaho, May 2S. â The police here to-day unearthed three infernal
machines that had been cached near a fashionable boarding-house. The ma
chines aro ingenious in their makeup and were intended to be loaded with
dynamite. i
There has been considerable feeling 1 here because certain bankers refused
for a lone time to subscribe to a popular railroad fund for thÂ« Idaho Mid
land, the proposed Boise-Butte road, .and' one theory Is that the machines ,were
made for them and cached to await a favorable moment to use them.
MEASURE TO
PREVENT GERMAN
DISCRIMINATION
Bailey Introduces a Bill
Indorsed by Livestock
Association.
\ â¢_,
Gives the President Power to Raise
the Duty on German Products if
a Prohibitive Tariff Is
Placed on Meat.
WASHINGTON. May 2S.â As a result-of
conferences to-day between President J. W.
Springer of Denver, of the National Live
stock Associaiicn, and members of Con
gress relative to the German meat In
spection bill, the following bill was intro
duced in the House of Representatives by
Representative Bailey of Kansas:
That whenever the President of the United
States shall be Informed that the Government
of the German empire has passed a law im
posing prohibitory duties on meat products,
which may be Imported Into that country from
the United States, he shall Issue a proclamation
fixing a time when all articles produced or man
ufactured in the German empire, when entered
for consumption at the ports of the United
States, shall pay a duty of 10 per cent In ex
cess of the duties Imposed thereon prior to the
passage of thie act; and all such products and
manufactures when so entered for consump
tion after said time, fixed by the President,
eliall pay such increased duties.
The bill was referred to the^Ways and
Means Committee, and Mr. Springer saw
merrfbers of that committee with a view to
urging- early action. He said as to the
measure:
"The National Livestock Association is
the largest organization of its kind In the
world, representing over $600,000,000, and
with it are federated on this subject the
American Shorthorn Breeders' Associa
tion, the National Hereford Breeders' As
sociation and some hundred livestock or
ganizations. We feel that the livestock
industry is singled out by the German
empire for direct discrimination, and all
the stock people will feel the effect of
such action. They feel, too, that the time
has come for the allied stock interests of
the United States to speak out in no un
certain tones, and they hflpe to direct the
attention of Congress and the Govern
ment to the situation. All the livestock
States are deeply interested In what Is
bejng done and are desirous of having ad
equate measures adopted to overcome the
discrimination by Germany."
Probably Intended for Certain Bankers
Who Had Refused to Subscribe to"
a Railroad Fund.

the closing of the schools. He took oc
casion to remark to those present that the
board desires especially that all cases of
incompeteneV among teachers be prompt
ly reported without fear and that inves
tigation in every case would promptly
follow.
"We desire to have it understood," he
said, "that we are here to do our duty
and the question of 'pull' never enters
Into our deliberations. No single teacher,
has any more pull with this board than
another. All communications concerning
teachers who are reported as incompetent
or otherwise unfit to be in our schools
will be regarded as confidential and will
not be made public unless formal charges
are made after a careful investigation has
been completed. Things may have been
different in the past, but this will be the
rule now."
NO MORE "PULL" IN
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
logue is bright and the situations are in
teresting. Ernest Hastings, as the hus
band, and Irene Everett, as the wife, were
excellent, and they were ably assisted by
the other members of the company. Next
Monday night will inaugurate the Flor
(t co Ro'certs season, v.-hen the much
talked-of "Sapho" will be presented.
Grand Opera-House.
Isabella and Columbus in Rice's ex
travaganza "1492' delighted the audience
at the Grand Opera-bouse last evening.
The specialties in the second act, the fine
work of the chorus in th* marches and
dancs- were- deservedly applauded, and
the songs were encored liberally, more es
pecially George Lydlng's "Ave Maria"
from "Cavalleria Rusticana."
Oljmpia.
Harry Holmes and his dog were the hit
of the bill at the Olympia last night. The
rest of the programme is good.
Ftscher's Concert House.
A large and critical audience rede
manded the sextet from "Lucia" last
night at Fischer's Concert House and Sig
nora Barducci, Signorlna Pollettinl. Miss
Sandolln and Signers Bardaracco, Vargas
and Abramoff had to repeat the celebrat
ed number. Signor Abramoff sang the
great "Piff. Pair. " from "The Huguenots"
in his usual masterly style, and Aliss San
dolin gave some English ballads charm
ingly. Little- Melville Coakky, a child
singer, comedian and impersonator, made
an immediate hit. and August Hinrichs'
excellent orchestra had many musical
novelties to offer on the programme. At
the request of many patrons Manager
Fischer has decided to reserve the first
row of seats in tho balcony.
Farce Comedy Season.
A summer season of farce comedy will
be Inaugurated at the California Theater

Neill at the California.
James Xeill made another hit last night
at th* California Theater In "Lord Chum
ley." A crowded house greeted the com
pany, and the audience was appreciative
to the last curtain. "I^ord Chumley" will
hold the boards to-night and at to-mor
row's matinee, and the rest of the- week
will be given to other plays of Mr. Neill's
repertoire. Saturday night closes his suc
cessful engagement.
_ N "When We Were Twenty-One" Mr.
f Goodwin has by far the strongest play
I (I he has ever presented in San Fran
:" Cisco. Its author, Mr. H. V. Esmond,
has been for many years a Lionflon a^ctor:
his professional training has borne fruit
ill the neatness, strength and climatic in
terest of th'is. his fourth or fifth play.
"When We Were Twr.ty-One" tells the
story of the friendship of four middle
aped ai,d kindly gentlemen for onÂ© Rich
ard Audaine, foE<21y known by them ae
Tne Imp. He, dear boy, Is young and.
feeling h!s youthful dignity, takes most
ur.kir.dly the efforts of his four friends
to rescue him from the clutches of a
worthless Â¦p-crnar. with whom he thinks
himself desperately In lox - e. He quarrels
IKlth them al! in general and with Klchard
Osxewe (Mr. Goodwin), who loves him
best, in particular. But for the good
fcesM of the aforesaid worthless woman,
who throws the boy over as saon as she
linis out that he Is pocr. the story would
have had a tragic instead of a happy
ending.
This play 5s not milk for babes, but
ftror.p meat for mÂ»Â»n and women. The.
only thir.gr of questionable taste Is the
petting chosen for the. third act. Yet
Mrs. Gordon's telling exclamation, "This
i.Â« not life; it is death," gives ?o true and
clear an interpretation of the situation
that no thoughtful mind can miss it.
Mr. Goodwin is entitled to our thanks
for bringing forwa-d such a thoughtful
etudy r.f life, serious ar.d humorous by
turn. That he is not always con\incing
Jn the former aspect is merely to say that
r.ature has not endowed him'with capaci
ty to fxcel in the one as he undoubtedly
does in the other. Time, was whrn Mr.
Goodwin's name wes associated only with
the comic: his steady progress from the
days of Evangreiine to these of Esmond's
play signifies an ambition that may yet
place him in the front rank of his pro
icfslon.
Sir. Henry Woodruff played Richard
Audaine with sincerity and force and the
other male parts were admirably filled.
Among the ladie<= Miss Haskins carried a
small but dIClcult role with an ease and
certainty that made one wish she had a
more Important part in the play. Al
though Miss Maxine Elliott has learned *
great deal about acting Fince she began
â¢to play with Mr. Goodwin, her voice is
j-til! far from being capable of expressing
rice shades of feeling. But when looking
upon h*r face criticism is disarmed in the
presence of beauty that Is its own excuse
Ict being. L. DU PON'T SVLE.

the fainting lady with a pretended swoon
on, and her neglectful lover with a tardy
arm and an eye on a ticker. Is fitted neat

The Orpheum programme keeps pecret
the name of the "hefting" author, who, if
hr- had only "hefted" some raote and as
Â¦well, would have built a comedietta
Â¦worthy of the dainty little actress. One
of these days, when Miss Burkhart has a
7>!ay written around her fetching person
ality, her mischievous laugh and her un
usual feminine appreciation of wit. It Is

ited American stars.
: Ther" are other good thinp* on the Or
pheum programme besides Mis? Burkhart.
Â«n<J among them are Gertie Carlisle and
Eager Midgler Jr. in a Juvenile rural com
edy, "After School." Gertie Carlisle was
Â¦ favorite here a few years ago, when
"little" was prefixed to her name. Gertie
has not grown much since then, but she
if a few years older, quite as clever and
every bit as popular.
Tivoli.
"Places aoz Messieurs" this week at the

eung by Tom Greene, and the Three
G-jardfcmenâ Jcsrph Fogarty, William
Schuster and Arthur Boyce. with the
aforesaid Bweet-voleed tenor â do fome
enjoyable cuartet work. The ever funny
Ferris Hartman, as Plancbet. ' and a
French fisher sirl between times, kept
ih<? audience in a continued roar. MisS
Annie MyÂ«rp has a erateful part in Con
etance Bonac'c-ux. and Mi*s Frances Gra
ham ar.d ttclcn Merrill filled acceptably
th<? flight roles allotted to them. The rest
of the larpe cust was acceptably filled by

Rev. George C. Adams' Strong Ideas
on Dancing and Other World
ly Pleasures.
Rev. George C. Adams, pastor of the
First Congregational Church, delivered
an interesting talk before the Methodist
ministers yesterday on "Ministerial Pru
dence." He Bald that ministers ought to
have a little of the wisdom of the ser
pent and the harmleesness of the dove.
He also said that a minister must be pru
dent in his church work and not under
take to attack matters he does not know
anything about.
"Some he said, "thunder
a; out the y evll of the theater and they
know nothing about it. We may yet see
the day when the theater will be an edu
cator â an upllfter. It is well to remember
that there are people on the stage who
are of pure thought and upright mo
tives."
He said if ministers did not approve of
dancing and theaters and other worldly
pleasures, they should call attention to
something else. He did not believe In
crying down secret societies, nor did he
tHl pÂ»*ople It was sinful to belong to such
organizations. He said if he was asked
by young men whether they should join
societies, he would advise them to follow
their conscience. He believed in encour
ajhr.g people to be faithful to the dictates
or their conscience and Providence or
Ood would direct them to do what was
rie^t The speaker stated that many min
istrrs were sorry that the Methodist Gen
eral Conference had not -touched on the
KUbject of dancing. He claimed that
whenever children are prohibited from
dajicing thHr toes began to tingle and
they would ask why?
"There if a better way to prohibit danc
ing" he said. "Get the individual to fol
low' the dictates of his conscience and
fill his poul with the positive, life of the
Master."

paper before the Presbyterian ministers

The executive committee of the Repub

to-day at the Palace Hotel and organize.
It is understood that George Stone will
be chosen chairman and Senator W. M..
Cutter secretary.
Lawyers who have closely studied sec
tion 1370 of the Political Code believe that
power is not vested in the executive com
mittee to give proper notice of the party's
intention to hold a State primary election
in August. The notice must be siven forty
days before the election; hence It is con
tended that a meeting of the State Cen
tral Committee must be convened before
July 2. The primary elections will be held
August 14. The law holds that the notice
of intention must be given by the govern
ing body of the party In the territory.
Delegates to the Republican National
Convention from this State wUl leave here
June 12 at 10 a. m. The special train will
run over the Central Pacific to Ogden;
over the Union Paciilc to Council Bluffs;

Chicago, and over the Pennsylvania line
to Philadelphia. It is expected that tho
Nevada delegates will join the Califor
nia ns at Reno. California headquarters

cal military authorities to receive General
Otis with all the dignity and pomp becom
ing his high rank and by tho public to
accord him all the honor due a man whose
military genius has done so much toward
putting down the insurrection in the Phil
ippines and who has done his duty at all
times in the face of the most scathing
criticism of his political opponents.
When General Otis lands he will be met
at tho wharf by the highest representa
tives of the army and navy now in thÂ»
city and by the civil authorities. Tho
troops at the Presidio will be ordered out
and the usual display made. His personal
escort will .be a light battery and four
heavy batteries of artillery. It is expected
that the general will remain at the Palctce
Hotel durine his stay in the city, which
will necessarily be brief, as he is anx
iously expected at Washington.

a few weeks ago was commander in chief

A number of ppople who hang around
O'Loary's saloon on Davis street knew
that the old man v.as to cash his pension

his watch.
"Soon after I left the saloon to go
home." says Adams. "T heard some one

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW TOP.K. May 2S.â The opening of a new
showed no material change in speculative
conditions and the stock markets of New York.
London. I'aris and Berlin continued dull and
neglected. In New York another brokerage
f.rcn announced its ruEperslon. the failure be
lr.g anaourt*i, as was that of Price. McCor
ir.ick & Co.. on the Cotton and Stock ex
changes almost eiraultaneousiy. The ckslng out
of the firm's contracts on the Stock Exchange
under the rules resulted in transactions in
Â¦ bout ten thousand shares. That prices were
Inclined to advance under the Influence of the
tenement was satisfactorily explained by the
fact that the buying of stocks for the -firm
outnumbered the selling fully three to one.
That is to say. the bouse was largely short of
the market. The failure is attributed to cot
ton speculation, as the recent movement of
stocks has b*en in favor of outstanding con
tracts cf the firm. Last week's rumors of
financial <iie5culti<rÂ«, which related to this
house, brought pressure to bear qjiJ precip
itated the assignment. The fac: that the same
kind of rumors are circulated regarding tome
cthÂ»-r' houses is a factor in keeping Wall street
frmiment unsettled. The only notable move
menta during the day were the advances in
triig&r. euppospd to be on better covering, and
la Uurllr.gtor. on resumption of business of the
6arr.e character as that which has given the
Flock Its recent strength. These advances
prompted some sharp rallies at other points
fcnd Â«jir.e of the earlier losses were recovered.
The market was semi-staEnant at times and
the closing was dull and irregular. London
eold small amounts of stock, although that
market as a whole showed strength on the
advance of the British into the Transvaal. It
is worth re-rnfmb-rlng that the speculative
world has bas^l its largest hopes regarding
the enÂ«J of the Transvaal war on the effect to
be profisoed In the money market by the re
eumrticn r.f the gold supply from the South
African mines, but at the present time there

difficulty 1* being experienced in finding profit
able employment for idle capital. Dullness
to-day wa? accentuated by the fact that the
veek'wlll be intÂ»jruj>tÂ«'d by a holiday in New
York and bjr th^yfar's great racing event in
London. Sterling exchange was weak to-day.
The bond rr-arket waa very dull and showed

CHICAGO. May 2S.â When the session began
the wheat market was affected by the fact that
the Northwest section was still without rain
and by the steadiness of cables. Reports from
the Southwest were favorable to the crop, but
this did not prevent July, which had opened
l /4C lower, at 0074c, from advancing to 67<&6"^c.
Later the weather prosrnosticator said there
was probability of showers In the dry section
to-nisht and the selling this caused sent July
back to 66Hc. The market steadied at this
point on covering: by shorts and the report that
the visible had decreased 2,300,000 bushels and
the domestic visible 4,508,000 bushels; recovered
to 6G!t&'67c. The close was steady, He under
Saturday, at 66vic.
The corn market was quiet and easy the
greater part of the session. Cables were weak.

ever, the market steadied on the visible de
crease of 2,410.00:) bushels. July closed VÂ»c over

Ocean rates for apples of course vary
but they usually run from 40 to 50 cents
per barrel. The charges In Liverpool for
dockage, insurance, advertising, samples,
town dues and for labor of handling
amount to about 7d English money and
the auctioneer's commission for selling is
5 per cent. The cost of getting the apples
to the steamer on this side varies like
wise according to the distance they have
to be shipped. Picking apples in the East
costs from 12 to 20 cents per barrel ac
cording to the skill of the pickers and the
amount of apples to handle. Special
pickers have In recent years entered the
field to contract for whole orchards and
they do the work so much better that th<Â»
loss to the farmer is greatly reduepri â
Scientific American. y reauced â
One barrel from every lot of twenty Is
opened on the portable platform and tho
contents dumped Into baskets, and an
other barrel is simply opened on the face
end. From an examination of these two
samples the buyer judges the lot of twen
ty, and makes his purchase accordingly.
Only tight barrels are delivered to him;
"slack" barrels, where the apples rattle,
are rejected. These latter sell separately,
and usually from 50 to 75 cents" a barrel
less. When a purchaser's bid is accepted
he can take his twenty barrels or as many
more of the same brand as he desires
at the same price. The apples are deliv
ered to the purchaser direct from the
steamer's dock, which saves the cost of
double cartage.
Liverpool is by far the greatest distrib
uting point for American apples, and as
high as 100,000 barrels of our apples have
been sold there in one week, and at re
munerative prices. London. Glasgow and
Hull also receive immense cargoes of
American apples, and absorb on an aver
age from 20.tX)0 to 30.000 barrels a week
during the season. The apples are sold
in Liverpool by the auction system. A
large room is provided for the buyers and
the auctioneer. In Ihe center of this room
there is a portable platform or a freight
elevator, where samples of the lots to be
disposed of are exhibited. An auctioneer
who has a line to dispose of has forty
minutes at his disposal, and if his goods
are not all sold in that time he must tem
porarily stand aside to make room for an
other salesman. Monday, Wednesday and
Friday are the auction days, and a single
auctioneer may dispose of 10.000 to 15,000
barrels in a day. The apples are cata
logued, and those brands which have a
reputation for honesty and good packing
frequently sell without sampling.
The West has become such an impor
tant factor in the apple problem that it U
estimated that these comparatively new
orchards could supply all the apparent
needs of the market if half the trees in
the country faiied to produce anything.
At first tho sudden flood of this fruit 'rom
Kansas. Missouri, Xebraska. Michigan
and other Western States completely de
moralized the Eastern markets, reaching
a climax in 1V^6. when apples in New
England were offered on the trees at 15
cents a barrel, and hand-picked Baldwins
delivered on the cars at 40 cents a barrel.
The orchards in the West were planted
in thirty, fifty and one hundred acres,
and in" order to prevent growers from go
ing into bankruptcy a great flood of the
apples was rushed to Europe. The ex
ports of our apples have consequently
grown to phenomenal proportions, nnd
without this demand the crop would prove
a financial failure every season.
The present harvesting season of the
apple is now in progress, and the official
reports Indicate an "off-season." which
ten years ago would mean an apple scar
city this winter that would make the fruit
an expensive article of diet. But prices
will advance only a trifle over those of
last season. The factories will consume
fewer marketable apples and depend more
upon the apple waste, such as cores and
peelinjjs, for their supply. These Jelly
factories in good season buy apples on
the trees, but in years like the present
they can make their apple syrup jelly
from the waste of the canning factories.
There are some 130 factories In the coun
try engaged in canning this fruit and
making cheap jellies and syrups. In the
aggregate they have an annual capacity
of over 200.000.000 jars of jelly alone. The
jellies made from the apple waste are al
most as good and wholesome as those
manufactured from the whole apples. The
cores and peelings, and small, inferior ap
ples are ground up and the juice extracted
therefrom. This juice or syrup becomes
the foundation ol the cheap jellies and
not chemical compounds, as some sup
pose.
Since the West and Northwest entered
extensively Into apple growing, the so
called "oiÂ£ years" m this crop no longer
affect the marKets as they did fifteen and
twenty years ago. One season of great
scarcity then, with extremely high prices,
would often by followed by a year ot
superabundance, when the market 'would
be glutted with apples, which were diffi
cult tp dispose or at any price. The
thoub'unds of acres of apple orchards in
the great West prevent an old-fashioned
famine in apples, and the improved meth
ods ot exporting the fruit, and the numer
ous factories which make cheap jellies
and . preserves, tend, to distribute the
abundant crops so well that unprofit
able prices do not rule in the markets in
good seasons.
There Can Be No. Famine.

v WASHINGTON, May 28.â Justice Brew
er to-day handed down, the opinion of the
Supreme Court in the somewhat cele
brated insurance case brought by the ex
executor of Guy C.'Phlnney of the State
of Washington against the Mutual Life
Insurance Company of New York to re
cover upon a policy of insurance upon his
life amounting to $100,000. Phinney had
paid-the first premium upon his policy
and had failed to pay the second and
third premiums, dying soon after the
third premium was due. In the trial the
contention was made that the statute of
New York requiring specific notice to the
insured of the date when a premium is
due and the place where it could be paid
was applicable. The trial court ruled In
accordance with this contention and the
jury brought in a verdict against the in
surance company for $97,000. The Circuit
Court of Appeals for the ninth circuit dis
missed the case on a technicality.'
The Supreme Court to-day declined t;hn
question of the applicability of the New
York insurance laws to the case and dis
posed of it upon the ground that the
Court of Appeals had jurisdiction. A new
trial was ordered.; The decision was in
the interest of the insurance company.
Several other insurance cases were de
cided by Justice Brewer on the same
ground. ' '

Mrs. Leahy Falls in Front of a Fast-
OToving Train and Is Drftgjjed.,.
From Danger by Ed
Frisbie.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, May 2S.
A mother with a three-year-old child in
her arms stumbled and fell in front of the
Niles "flyer," near Twenty-third avenue.
this afternoon, and both were saved by
the prompt action of Ed Frisbie, a con
ductor of the Southern Pacific Company.
The woman was Mrs. Mary Leahy, who
lives at 1064 Twenty-fifth avenue. She was
crossing the tracks and did not seem to
exercise the care that is necessary when
traveling upon railroad tracks and was
not looking for the approaching train.
This fact was noticed by the family of
James Miller and by Mr. .Frisbie, both of
whom live near by.
Mr. Frisbie, who was nearly ready to
report at the pier for duty, remarked- that
the woman would probably get into
trouble, started down to the tracKs. Just
as he did so the woman started to cross
the tracks, stumbled over a rail and fell,
with her child in her arms, directly In
front of the approaching train.
Mr. Frisbie jumped for the fallen
woman and seized first the child and then
the mother, dragging them out of danger
just as the train swept by.
The baby was a little cut and bruised by
the fall and was taken by Mr. Miller's
family and tenderly 'cared for. The
woman went to her own home. Later the
rescuers declined to return the child to
the mother, alleging unfltness upon tee?
part to care for it. and claiming that she
was under the influence of liquor at the
time she fell in front of the train. The
child was turned over to Mrs. Lydia
Prescott.

crowded hour this afternoon, with the

is very narrow for the amount of traffic

the runaway.it was lined with vehicles of
all descriptions.
Logan was driving a heavy team at
tnched to a large freighting wagon. One
of the horses gave its head a swing and
jerked the reins out of Logan's hand and
in a second they wore dragging .on the
ground under the animals' feet. Logan
climbed down upon the pole to recover the
lines and Just at that moment the team
became frightened and began to run. .
Logan threw himself flat upon the back
of one of the horses and managed to se
cure the reins near the bridle. In this
awkward position he managed to not only
guide the running horses safely through
the crowded street but finally brought
them to a standstill. The wild ride at
tracted a great crowd and many com
ments upon the bravery of the young
driver were heard.

<}7=)) ERKELET, May 28.â At his beau-
Ibs^ Uful residence. La Loma, in the
jt_J) foothills of Berkeley, Captain Rich
ard P. Thomas died from a stroke
of apoplexy this morning. His life, which
was an eventful one. was marked with
business successes and deeds of charity to
his fellow men.
Captain Thomas was born near Syra
cuse, N. Y., seventy-flve years ago, where
he received his education and business
training. Until the outbreak of the Civil
War ho was a merchant in a little village
near Ithaca, N. Y. In 1SG1 he raised and
organized a troop of the famous Lincoln
Cavalry. He was elected captain, but
retired to the rank of first lieutenant that
a man who equipped the organization
might be placed at its head. Within a
few months, however, he was promoted
to the rank o{ battalion adjutant, retiring
from the army when that office was abol
ished.
In 1SG3 he came to California and" In
dulged in various mercantile pursuits un
til he became president of the First Na
tional Bank and owner and president of
the Standard Soap Works. In 1890, shortly
after this bank was threatened with ruin
through the poor investments of its
cashier, he retired from active business
though he always kept a watchful eye
on all his enterprises.
He retired to his beautiful Berkeley
residence which he purchased In 1830. It
consists of thirty acres in Xorth Berkeley
and commands a splendid view of the
Golden Gate and bay. There he spent hlg
latter days Improving the property.
He- had â¢ an Inventive genius and ob
tained several patents. One which at
tracted considerable attention several
years: ago was a suspended trolley line.
He Invented, modeled and placed on ex
hibition at. one Mechanics' Fair an over
head trolley line. He first Intended it to
be placed in operation from East Berkeley
to Grizzly Peak, and if It proved success
ful It was to be used in other places.
The liquidation of his bank prevented
him from carrying out his .fad.
His death was very sudden and unex
pected. He left the house about 10 o'clock
after telling his wife he did not feel well
and would take a nap in his little cabin.
When he did , not answer the dinner call
aisearch was Instituted resulting in find
ing his body some distance from the
cabin. It is thought he felt better and
was on his way to the rabbitry, In which
he was much interested,, when his heart
failed Â¦= him. . .- â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦.-/
He leaves a widow and adopted daugh
ter. Mrs. Woltman of -New York.
The funerar will be held to-morrow
afternoon at ,3 o'clock. .
Woman Attempts Suicide.
While despondent last night Mrs. Lydia
Rourke, living at 717& Natoma street, at
tempted to commit suicide by swallowing
the contents or a bottle of paregoric. Her
groans attracted the -attention of one of
the. occupants of the house, who had her
removed to the Receiving Hospital. She
will recover.

Incorrigible Children.
OAKLAND. May 23.â Justice Junes La
rue of Brooklyn Township has called the
attention of -the Board of Supervisors to
the condition Of -a family nimed -La"Â»ki
who. reside on East Twenty-first street'
near Twenty-third avenue. There are said
to be eight children In the family, who
are allowed- by their parents to run wild

ORDERS were recently issued at the
California-street police station
which has caused a general jollifi
cation among the veterans of the
flowing bowl who make their headquar
ters along the Barbary Coast and on the
water front, wherever drinkables are to
be had. No more can Officers Thomas W.
Handley and' Bob Connors arrest any of
this gentry wherever they may find them
for being drunk and take them for star
light rides in the patrol wagon.
The order reads that the policemen must
not enter saloons to take prisoners for
misdemeanors, but must take them on the
streets. As the "boozers" are never
Whenever Patrolmen Handley and Con
nors put their heads together there Is
something doing on their beats. It has
been their custom to enter a saloon, wake
"up a score of ragged vagrants snoring on
the floors, or separate a gallon of cheap
wine from a bunch of Inebriates and line
them all up against a police call box and
wait for the patrol wagron to cart their
prizes to the station.
Now all is changed. When the rounders
became apprised of the new order they
posted sentries on the streets, and now
known to leave the side of a bar long
enough to go through a door, the officers'
records will be dimmed, and they must
now resort to strategy to earn their sala
ries.

OAKLAND, May 2S.â The congregation
of the Newark Presbyterian Church gath
ered yesterday in proper humility of spir
it to worship, but before they were
through with their devotions they turned
out in hurried excitement to fight a flrÂ«
that had taken hold of the church edifice.
The blaze broke out In another building
and was communicated to the temple of
God. When the smoke began to pour Intc
the church the pastor hurriedly dismissed
the service and led his flock to the battla
against the destroying element. The sa
cred edifice was saved by the heroic ef
forts of the worshipers, but it was badly
damaged.
The tire burned a house and barn owned
by Manuel Sllva and four cottages owned
by F. C. Jarvis. The railroad shops were
threatened, but the employes saved them.
The fire started in Sllva's barn. The causa
is not known.

While the police department has deter
mined to make a vigorous prosecution of
the case against Green, the accused man
was prepared to meet the attack. On one
side it is charged that the moving vlewj
which have been displayed are entirely
unfit for public display. Green claims that
he has not violated the city ordinance
which forbids exhibitions of obscene pic
tures. Â¦
The views of which complaint is made
have been exhibited In mechanical nickel
in-the-slot devices, known as kinetoscopes.
or mutoscopes. The establishment which
was raided has. according to the police,
been largely patronized by young persons,
and complaint is made that the displays
have been of such a character as to war
rant suppression.
Green protested that his views were for
the most part copies of recognized works
of art of world-wide repute. The police
admit that some of the pictures are In
that category, but that these have been
sandwiched in with many which have
nothing of the artistic to recommend
them. The evidence consists of thirteen
of the machines containing the photo
graphs of which complaint has been mane.
These have been sealed, and the question
of their ultimate destruction will rest
upon the result of the trial.
Although some of the photographs were
removed from the boxes when the police
notified Green on Saturday, there were
many remaining to which objection was
made. The ease will be set to-morrow
for trial at a near future date.
Complaint was sworn to In the Police
Court to-day by Sergeant of Police Mc-
Kinley accusing Frank V. Green of ex
hibiting immoral pictures. This is the re
sult of the raid made last night by Chief
of Police Hodgklns on the phonograph
parlors conducted by Green & Kendall at
472 Seventh street.

HIS Broadway, May 28.
When aged John Taylor, a wealthy pio
neer of Contra Costa County, made a
deathbed will cutting off his daughters
and a grandson with $1, he laid the foun
dation for one of the bitterest contests
| ever waged in the courts on this side of
the bay. His alleged widow, Martha Tay
lor, was made practically sole beneficiary
under the will. She is the proponent in
the contest which the daughter. Mrs.
; Martha Mullikan, instituted. The trial
will begin at Martinez on Thursday be
fore Judge Buckles of Solano County and
Â¦ a jury.
Because of the prominence of the fam
ily, the conditions under which Taylor
met death and the charges which have
been made Â«grainst Mrs. Taylor, the battle
over the deceased pioneer rancher's estate
has aroused interest in both Alameda and
Contra Costa counties, where he had been
Â¦ widely known for many years.
Taylor died in Oakland In November,
1S38, from the effect of Injuries he sus
tallied In an accident while he was driv
ing ovtr the Fish ranch road from his
home at Lafayette to Oakland. Shortly
before death he made his will, devising all
of his estate to his wife, except $1 to hi3
daughter and the same amount to Jeffer
son Davenport, a grandson.
As soon as the will was filed there was
trouble. The daughter retained attorneys
and opened the tight. In the first place
she charged that Mrs. Taylor was an ad
venturess and had married the old man to
get Ills wealth; that she had taken ad
vantage of his infirmities and had preju
diced him against his daughter. The
charge was also made that for a long
time before her alleged marriage to Tay
lor Mrs. Taylor had sustained mar
ital relations with one Crabtree. living in
Contra Costa County, and that they were
reputed to be man and wife. Therefore
it was charged she could not legally wed
Taylor.
The complaint reiterates the allegation
that Mrs. Taylor was a designing woman
and that she used all of her arts to ingra
tiate herself with the pioneer and to wean
him away from his daughter and grand
sen, the only other living heirs to his for
tune.
Emphatic denials were entered to all of
tlie accusations, and the preliminary con
tests have been fought to the limit. The
contest v>as filed in ISTtS, and every move
since then has been a sharp legal battle.
Mrs. Taylor is represented by Attorneys
K. M. Gibson and B. F. Woolner of this
city, and the contestant's attorneys are
R. M. Fitzgerald and Carl M. Abbott.

BITTER FIGHT
OVER WEALTHY
MAN'S ESTATE
JUS Broadway, May 2S.
The Pacific Coast Congregational Con
gress, which held sessions In San Fran
c'scci last week, resumed its programme
this morning in the First Congregational
Church of tnis city. The subject of dis
cussion in the morning was "The Relation
<>t the Church to the i'oung." The topic
was di^ussea from three points of viewâ
We Sumiay school, young people's organ
izations and mature classes.
The Rev. F. 1. D. \\ heat of San Fran
cisco. Rev. J. H. Goodell of Petaluma and
Kc-v. M. D. Dunning ol Forest Grove. Or..
who spoke on Sunday schools and their
work, were of the cpiuioa that the Sunday
eehools should adopt to a larger degTee
the methods employed by the public
schools; that teachers of special training
and better books than those used at pres
ent should be employed. The Rev. Mr.
"Wheat was for a graded system with
large instead of small classes.
\oung people? organizations were dis
cussed by the Rev. L. M. Walters of
Iresno. He declared that the church
could not afford to be an exception in the
grvat movement for organization and ihe
young people should be gathered up and
cared for.
."The Social Side cf the Kingdom" was
the subject of discussion at the afternoon
session. Papers were read by J. T.
Nichols of Fremond, Wash., on "Home
U.te." L. D. Ilathbone of Santa Rosa on
"Social Life," P. S. Kr.isht of Salem. Or..
en "Sabbath" and E. D. Weagre of Tularo
on "The Saloon "
Rev. C. P. Dorland of Los Angeles de
livprrd an addren this evening at the
oongTess on the subject of the "Relation
ft the Church to Social Movements of the
I>aj ." The speaker touched upon the diffi
culties confronting' the masses in a man
ner that showed careful consideration of
the labor q?:e5=ilon and the things that
have don** much to keep the church apart
from those whose only doctrine teaches
them that th^ir daily brÂ»Â»ad is paramount
to any consideration of spiritual welfare.
"We must consider the temporal as well
as the spiritual wants of the man." said
t be speaker. "We go with our teachings
end of time? provisions to the savage far
from here, but at the same time ignore
the man around the corner who is much
wore preatly In need of our ministrations
than ihe aborigines across the sea.
"It has always been the policy of the
church to keep aloof from the things po
litical and those rvhich do not directly
conccrn, the spirituality of man. Thi<Â« is a
mistake. If we believe that a man may
re>itrn himself to God mentally and at the
fii^" time rob his fellows do we make it
an object for The masses to join the
church? No. The church cannot alwavs
indorse new ideas, even if they should : oe
for the common pood.
"That would favor too much of politics.
Why. only to-day we were compelled to
touch very pir.pÂ«rly the subject of prohi
r.ition. Of course, the church is naturally
In sympathy with any movement or re
form which tends toward the enlighten,
mem of man. Â«Whlle it cannot always in
dorse a policy it can lend its moral Â«ud
port.
"Socialism, the panacea of many think
ers tor the existing evils, has not "been in
dorsed by the church, though it means
much for tl;p welfare of the workingman.
It stands for an increase In the thlnps
that tend toward the betterment of the
masses.
"If the ministry nf this day will go out
sis Jesus did among men there will come
tli* multitudes who want to hear the mes
eape of tiod."
The Rev. J. F. navies of San Bernar- !
Â«lir.o. <&"ho wts to address the congress to
morrow morning, will be unable to be
present on account of illness, and the time
allotted to him will be devoted to an open
discussion of "Moral Leadership of the
Church."

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
As- a "last precaution . the king applied
his nostrils delicately .to those of the rat
tler, and repeated th*t several times, as
if to detect the faintest breath. . Satis
fied at last; it released itÂ» enemy, but stIH
watched.- ready to resume its hold at the
slightest "sign of life.
There I left him, keeping grim guard
QVer the body of his vanquished foe. -As I
And so the struggle continued, till the
rattler could not writhe freely, and he
was held as a vine wraps a tree.
1 cn he lay still the king snake began
to uncoil himself slowly, and at every
motion of his enemy the constrictot's
folds contracted and crushed with killing
effect.- Even when there was only a
quiver of :the tail, the king still gripped
the throat. -It was: plain 'he .had a whole
some reppect for the fangs, that were still
terrible. il |I^^WU|i|jwOT<itW JIM1IM t)f MW
I looked carefully and saw that his
anger was directed at a rattlesnake that
lay colled at the foot of the tree. The
snake was compressed into a ball, from
,the middle of which its rattle sounded,
continuously; its blazing little eyes were
fixed unchangingly upon those of the
squirrel. ' â¢ i
. The buzz, buzz droned on the summer
air with a sleepy effect, but the squirrel
scolded in an ever ascending key. But
for the hint of the squirrel's eyes I could
not have located the rattler. His color
and his variegated markings offered but
little contrast to his surroundings. His
monotone of noise was indefinite, and to
sight as well as in souud, he seemed
only a blur on the background of dark
sand on which he lay. # ' â¢ . |
Was the squirrel only curious to satisfy*;
himself as to the character of that
strange object, or was he hypnotized? I
have often amused myself by exciting the
violent curiosity of the little animal, but
never did a waving or jumping object
awaken such Intense and painful emotion
as theÂ»rattler always demands.
I knew what must follow soon; that the
squirrel's cries would grow weak, that
he would grow dizzy, and finally tumble
from the tree, hang a moment by one
claw, and then drop into the jaws of the
living death. that lay in wait. I had
raised my rifle to save the little fellow,
when the tragedy was interrupted from
another quarter.
Swift as light, a form raced on the
stage. It was clothed in a gleaming coat
of beautiful white and black spots; i,t
Ehlfted and shone like a necklace of pre
cious stones, and I knew the king snake
claimed a victim. â¢
The newcomer was smaller than the
rattler, Its ground color was a greenish
gray and the spots scintillated in the
sunlight which sifted, down upon the
scene from the tangled branches over-
At the first rustle of Its approach the
rattler lost all' interest in the squirrel,
which ran back. Into the tree. .
The king snake Held his head high and
raced around the rattler" In a wide circle,
while the rattler tried to slink away. The
king darted forward as If to attack, and
the rattler threw himself into a coil. The
king was again away and racing around,
with a swiftness the tattler seemed un
able to follow with his eye. The rattler
was 'cowed already: his crest was low
ered his buzz, buzz was jerky and "un
even, and although he presented a very
different appearance from the self-con
fident arbiter of the woods which he had
ser-med when I first saw him. I oould
think of nothing but some human bully
surprised in the act of torturing his help
less victim, and suddenly compelled to
face an adversary worthy of his strength.
The king snake -seemed to enjoy the situ
ation as a cat does her cruel dallying
with a mouse. â¢
Round and round went the king snake,
and the rattler followed the movement
till Its neck was twisted. Whenever it at
tempted to turn the king would spring
forward, and it was evident that the first
failure of the rattler in swiftness would
be the signal for muscle to clinch with
venom. The king would race from left
to right and then reverse, and if the rat
tler failed to follow that would be the end
of him. â¢ This happened, and I saw tne
king In the air, but could not catch the
strike,' so instantaneous was it.
There was a confusion of flying pine
needles in a cloud of white dust, and I
saw that two Inches of the king's coll was
about the throat' of the rattler. Over and
over they went, the â¢ king's head above
that of his enemy, and a curve of his
body acting as a buffer to keep up the
motion which enabled him to take an
other turn and still another.
â¢ I found the little fellow on the' trunk
of a pine about ten feet from the ground,
jumping about as if in convulsions. He
would flourish his tail wildly, scold in
asger, threaten an assault, run buck a
lltXJe way up the 'trunk, and then return
and scold again.
One day I was returning from a day's
hunt, at peace with the world and my
self, when I heard a squirrel scolding
as if it were a ward politician the night
before election. The noise he made was so
loud 'and insistent that I turned out of
my way to see what could be the matter.
In Florida we have two constrictors es
pecially noticeableâ the black racer, which
grows to the length of. twelve feet and
makes a business of warring on rats and
other small deer the farmer hates,
the king snake, whose mission seems to
be the extermination of the rattler.
If the rattlesnake Is justly called the
king of America's woods and rocks yet
his crown is not held without danger,
since he is hunted diligently and success
fully. His fangs are, indeed, deadly, and
he wears a fine suit of armor, but the
deer and the wild hog never fail to attack
him, and he has an enemy of his own kind
still more dangerous to him.
Snakes may be divided into three classes
âthose which are venomous, the con
strictors and those which are neither.
Unless the second of these are wonderful
for their size they secure little of our at
tention, and yet they are generally beau
tiful in c/>lors, most graceful In action and
often among our best friends.

Mve In breadth, are made of hollow steel
ribs, covered with very light linen. The
propelling power is supplied by an un
usually powerful electric motor, the ma
chine being steered by a birdlike tall,
consisting of two adjustable spades; the
motor, tne propelling power oi which Is
calculated to lasi turee hours, weighs
eight pounds, while the whole machine
does not exceed seventeen pounds in
weight. Tne wines will sustum a man
weighing -ISO pounds. The whole appara
tus is stated lo be easy to handle, and to
secure not only a rapid ascent but a safe
descent. The availaoitity of this machine
having been proved in several successful
trials, the inventor is now perfecting a
tlylng machine, which consists of an alu
minum raven, covered with silk. .
A method by wh/ch a jet of recently
generated hydrogen can be Ignited wltn
absolute certainty and without risk or
loss of time is described by C C*. Hop
kins in the Journal of the American
Chemical Society. As soon as the action
begins the escaping sas is collected in a
test tube, und," when the latter appears
to be lull oi pure gas, it is to be removed
two or three feet trom the generator and
the hydrogen In it ignited. An imme
diate attempt is then to be made to light
the jet of hydrogen with the hydrogen
flame contained in the test tube, and, ir
the gas is explosive, it will explode in the
test tube ana leave no flame â if, however,
a flame remains in the test tube with
which the jet can be ignited it Is certain
that the gas in the generator Is no longer
explosive. By adopting the precaution,
therefore, of never lighting the hydrogen
jet except with the hydrogen flame thus
obtalneu, absolute satety- can be insured.
In fact, attempts may be made to ignite
the jet by this method as. often as
thought proper, and, if the hydrogen is
properly generated, the gas will be ig
nited in less than a minute.
One of the most impracticable engineer
ing schemes, apparently, is that of tun
neling the Bosphorus. There is an enor
mous traffic between the two sides of the
Bosphorus, and the delay caused by the
opening and shutting of the bridge of
beats, which forms now the only means
of communication, is a great drawback.
A railroad company is now constructing
its lines on both sides, but this Is of little
avail until the lines can be connected.
Tunneling by the ordinary way is hin
dered by the fact that the water Is ex
tremely deep, with twenty or thirty feet
of mud at the bottom. In order to solve
the problem it is proposed to suspend or
float a tunnel about thirty-five feet below
the surface of the water, allowing unin
terrupted passage to vessels of the larg
est tonnage. The Golden Horn has no
tide. The tunnel is to be a wrought Iron
tube about ten feet in diameter and 1200
feet lone, and the gradient at each end
would be fifty. It would weigh about 600
tons; maximum weight of any train 400
tons; concrete and lining to overcome the
buoyancy of the tube 1700 tons, and water
displacement 2700 tons.
At a meeting of the Iron and Steel In
stitute, Manchester, Kngland, last Au
gust, an interesting paper was read by
Professor Wiborg of Stockholm, on the
use of finely divided ore obtained by con
centrating process. By the introduction
of magnetic and other methods of separa
tion, the power of enriching iron ores by
the removal of undesirable constituents
has been greatly increased, and the waste
in working in the case of magnetic min
erals considerably diminished. The ad
vantages were, however, largely qualified
by the circumstance that the concentrate
was usually obtained as a ponder, thus
limiting its utility; the question, conse
quently, as to how much material could
be best applied becoming one of primary
importance. In view of this. Professor
Wiborg has himself designed a furnace
for the conversion of pulverulent ores in
to spongy iron capable of replacing scrap
in the usual open hearth furnace, and it
appears from the experimental trials
which have been made thus far that the
process is a practical success.
Turning to account the successful ex
periment of pneumatic tires on bicycles,
an Italian, Signor Emico del Pablo of
Undine, has recently Invented. a very in
geniuos sole for men's boots on the
pneumatic principle. Under the ball of
the foot and attached to the sole is
placed a tube of indiarubber, somewhat
stiff, in horseshoe shape, with three open
ings, one at each end and one In the mid
dle, these openings being In communica
tion with the outside air by means of a
' channel leading from the horseshoe tube
'to the heel. When the foot is lifted, as
in marching, the horseshoe tube is filled
with air. and when It Is placed upon the
ground it is supported on a species of air
cushion, the air finding exit and egress
through the holes; thus there is a diminu
tion of shock and a perceptible relief
from the fatigue of the feet after a
long march. *Â¦ ,'
The application of liquefied carbonic acid
gas to the extinguishment of underground
fires or fires in mines has been explained
by George Spencer before the Institution
of Mining Engineers, says Nature. It
seems that at a colliery with which Mr.
Spencer was connected a fire occurred
in a heading as a result of a fall of roof
and sides on steam pipes. The heading
was built off with as little delay as pos
sible, but. notwithstanding all efforts to
shut out the air. sufficient reached the
seat of tire' to keep 'it burning slowly: It
was therefore decided to apply carbon
dioxide and for this purpose six cylinders
of liquefied gas were successfully used. It
is not assumed that such a method can
be successfully applied to all fires; but,
i for instance. In case of fire on shipboard,
the use of carbon dioxide might prove In
valuable, being quickly applied, and sav
ing much damage by water. .
Hopes are entertained by experts in the
electric lighting industry xhat a .valuable
substitute for platinum has been found in
an alloy of nickel and steel. By varying
the proportion of either metal an alloy re
.sults with almost any kind of coefficient.
Thus, when only a small proportion of
nickel is employed, a coefficient of expan
sion between that cf Iron and that of
nickel Is obtained; with, say 23 per cent
of nickel, the coefficient expansion of
brass Is reached. As the proportion of
nickel Is then increased the coefficient of
expansion progresses until, on the. nickel
reaching 3? per cent, it becomes practi
cally nil â beyond which an increase again
takes place until, with 43 per cent of
nickel in the alloy, the coefficient becomes
equal to that of platinum, and the result
Is one of importance to the electrical in
dustry.
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, May 21.â
Charles H. Allen, Governor of Porto Rico,
is really Governor only in name. Accord
ing to the provisions of the Porto Rico
government bill he has not the power to
act without the Executive Council, and he
has no Council. His desk is heaped with
petitions, complaints and suggestions.
Delegations of country people march from
an interior town perhaps twenty miles
away. Some ask for work, others for
bread; all tell a tale of* starvation. The
Governor's private secretary attends to
them arid they are turned away diplomat
ically.
Since May 1 the people of Porto Rico
have been waiting expectantly the^PresI
dent's appointments. The Treasurer, the
Auditor and at last the Secretary of State
are accounted lor. The other appoint
ments are not made and the general sup
position is that they will not be made un
til Governor Allen returns to consult with
the President. Governor Allen said yes
terday that he had received no summons
from the President, and it is the general
opinion that he will return on June 1.
Postoftice Inspector Sinclair and his as
sistants have taken over the former De
partment of Posts. They are examining
the books and up to this writing have
reported no irregularities. It is expected
that everything will be found shipshape.
Â¦The school term will tlose on June 25.
The Educational Department has accom
plished wonders during the past year, aK
though it is still at loggerheads with some
natives who do not take to the American
educational system. Over seventy Ameri
can teachers are employed, mostly young
normal graduates, wherein lies the
trouble. The natives claim that native
teachers should be employed; and if that
should be done' the growing generation
would not be learning the Kngllsh lan
guage and the schools would gradually
drop back Into the old shiftless Spanish
methods.

Mayor Vetoes an Ordinance on Sub
ject and Suggests That Bankers
Pay More Taxes.
Thp Mayor vetoed an ordinance of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday which im
poses a license on "banks and money
brokers. The Mayor In his veto says:
The reason of my objection la that banks
should be licensed as at present on their gross
receipts and brokers as at present on . their
gross profits. . (See pages 117 and 118 of Gen
eral Orders, 1893.) fiy preparing a new sched
ule the city may properly derive an," lncreaoed
revenue from bankers. > Thirty-five- banks now
pay $4785 quarterly. The bankers receive ln a
special degree the Â¦ protection of 1 the Â¦ govern
ment. The police ; and detective, departments
and the courts, arc constantly employed .in
business arising'* out of the banks. : . â¢
The Supreme Court has . recently held that
certain, securities held by the banks, amount
ing to about J20.COO.000 In this city, are ex
empt from taxation. For thru? reasons I be
lieve: bankers' licences Rhould be i at least
doubled, v.hlch would yield : the city $20,000 a
year new revenue from this source. 1 . there
fore resubmit: the ordinance to your honorable
board for ita further consideration. Respect

To Try Boys' Cases.
Judge FYitz made arrangements with
Chief Sullivan yesterday to try all cases

The Judge agreed to open court at a
quarter of U o'clock every morning so
that the cawe of boys could be heard be

10 o'clock.
midst for years. We witness scenes even
now in that locality, though the 'upper
office' in the Police Department has been
changed. I ask you In a spirit of fair
play to stand by us and prove your
iriendship. It is not right that you
should repudiate this just claim for the
sake of paying other claims. Ours is a
prior one and takes precedence over all
others."
Chairman Jennings of the Finance Com
mittee replied 10 a question of Branden
stein that if the obligation was recognized
the city government would come to a
standstill. Brandenstein then asked the
Mayor to enllehten the members on the
proposition and to express his views.
The Mayor Is Fearful.
"When the last board appropriated $125 -
000 for the park." said the Mayor, "I had
to hold that it exceeded the $1 limit, but it
was put In the tax levy. It Is in the treas
ury now and If we were ln funds it would
be available. There Is. however, an ex
traordinary pressure on the general fund
1 have no advice -as to the legal status of
the case. Personally I am In favor of ac
quiring the park. It would, however, re
sult ln a struggle between the creditors of
the city and tne proponents of the park
and one side will suffer. It has been held
by the committee that creditors for sup
plies and labor should be given prece
dence. Mr. Reed's resolution, as I under
stand it, would onl" strengthen the hands
of the St. Mary's Park supporters if the
matter were taken to court."
Two Appropriations Made.
Attorney Shadburne argued that the
money for the purchase of the park had
been set aside and urged the board not to
divert it.
"There were two appropriations made
for tho purpose," said Shadburne. "and
one was taken away. The second time
the appropriation was Included ln the tax
levy and the money was unquestionably
raised for St. Mary's PaTk. It is the dutv
of you gentlemen of this board to stand
by the order your predecessors have
made. There have been some statements
that the money Is not !n the cltv treasurv
but we contend that every dollar of it is
there. A resolution was adopted by the,
former board directing the Finance Com
mittee to Include the money in the tax
levy, and any attempt to divert $1 of It
Is undoubtedly wronpr as a lepal proposi
tion. The opinion of the City Attorney
is clearly in favor of our contention that
the money should be used to purchase the
park, and I submit that you are bound
by that opinion to carry out. the provi
sions of the law."
Before the resolution was passed Bran
denstein askod Father Otis if he were
â¢wllllnp to release S^.OOft of the fund If It
wcro provided for In the next tax levy
Father Otis replied that pledpes had been
made before but had been broken. It was
discovered that no such pledge could be
given by the board and be of any effect
and the resolution was finally adopted '

Frank Monaghan Tells Police a Story
of Being Assaulted by a
Gripman.
Frank Monaghan, a clerk, yesterday
swore out a warrant for the arrest of a
gripman named Beebe. charging him with
an assault with a deadly weapon. Ac
cording to Monaghan, he boarded the de
fendant's car on Sunday night, being ac
companied by two women. Beebe took
exception to some remark that was made,
and. picking up a swttchlron, he struck
Monaghan over the head, inflicting a se
vere scalp wound. Up to a late hour last
night the gripman had not been arrested.
WHILE George L. Center, repre
senting the Mission Federation
of Improvement Clubs, has been
Investigating the finances and
expenditures of the Phelanlzed Board
of Public Works, Max Popper, represent
ing the same body, has inquired concern
ing'the plans of the Board of Health for
the disposal of public moneys. Messrs.
Center and Popper had the same object ln
view, which was to find out whether, by
dispensing with sinecures, some money
could not be saved for permanent Im
provements. Mr. Center, It will be re
membered, found that to every $3 that
the Board of Public Works proposed to
expend for actual work on streets, school
houses etc., the sum of $1 was set apart
for clerical labor and salaries. In other
words. $1 wiU go to those holding soft
snaps to every $3 expended for the actual
benefit of the public.
Mr.- Popper has obtained from officiate
at the City Hall a statement of the sched
ule of places, salaries and general ex
penses that has been mapped out by the
Phelan Board of Health. This schedule
is as follows:
Health Officer. $3000; secretary and assistant.
J33W two clerks tJ2400 and *i*X>). Â»330C ; chief
sanitary inspector, J1S00; six health Inspectors.
jr>00- four market inspectors, $3600; eight food
Inspectors, Â»7200; bakery inspector, $300; bath
and laundry. Inspector, $900; chief plumber,
$1500- two painters ($2400 and $900), $3300; dia
tnter'ment inspector, $1200; bacteriologist, $1SOO;
toxicologist, $600; chemist and assistants. $3300;
veterinary, $1200; statistician, $1SOO; vaccina
tion, $120o; messenger. $M0; city physician and
assistants. $3000.
Â£mergency and insane departmentâ Cnlef
surgeon, assistants, stewards, matrons and
ambulance drivers. $24,780; maintenance, under
the same heading. $11,960; total. $34,743.
Twenty-sixth Street Hospitalâ Salaries, $3660;
maintenance. $1CCO; total, $4660.
Almshouseâ Salaries, $22,000; maintenance,
$iO,OC4); total. $72,000.
City and County Hospitalâ Salaries. $32,000;
maintenance, $58,0C0; total, $50,000.
"I got these items.'' said Mr. Popper to
a Call representative, "from Dr. William
son, and he at that time said that the
charter gave the Board the right to em
ploy all necessary employes and to pay
them salaries.. I will call your attention
to Section 5, Article 10, of the charter,
treating of the Department of Public
Health. It says that the board "may" ap
point, and so forth, but does not make
it compulsory for that body to appoint. Â¦
"Dr. Williamson said tnat a superin
tendent physician was necessary for the
City and County Â« Hospital, and that the
board could provide One for it. The char
ter provides that the board shall fix sala
ries, but that the salaries must not exceed'
those paid for similar service ln private
institutions. I have been told that the
farmer at the Almshouse gets $M) per
month, his pay having been raised from
?(30. I would like to ask why the board
did that when the farmer has been satis
lied for years with $t>i) per month? The
civil service provision Of, the charter was
Ignored in this case. .
"I have reported to the Mission Federa
tion of Improvement Clubs that the food
inspection bureau could very well be abol
ished. It costs between JSCw and JIU.OOu per
annum. The food inspectors are not mar
ket inspectors. . No suggestion has been
made to do away with the market Inspec
tors, numbering four, who could do much
in other directions In addition to the du
ties now performed by them. The food
inspectors are supposed to investigate the
contents of cans and jars. In the absence
of State supervision the maintenance of
food inspectors at San Francisco alone
has no utility.
"Here let me suggest a question whicn
the Merchants" Association might well
consider when municipal salaries are un
der discussion, which is. "Do the mer
chants require as much help to sell $5'A>,tW0
worth'of goods as they do to sell J5.000.OX>
worth? 1 Would they provide elaoorate
machinery ior Going something before
they knew what they were going to do?
The figures concerning the salaries pro
vided tor the Board of Health tell their

ST. MARY'S PARK
Supervisors Rule That Fund
Shall Not Be Diverted
to Other Uses.
Bev. Father Otis Makes an Urgent
Plea for the Projectâ Auditor
and Treasurer Must Keep
Coin Intact.
Â«
THE Board of Supervisors adopted
resolutions last night declaring it
the sense of the board that the
money now ln the treasury set aside
for the purchase of the proposed St. Ma
rv's Square should not be used for any
other purpose. The resolution was Intro
duced several months ago by Reed, and
to make It more binding his amendment
directing the Auditor and Treasurer to
keep the money intact and not to pay any
demands out of It, except those calling for
payments on the land purchased for the
park, was also adopted. The vote on the
resolution stood:
Avesâ Booth. Brandenstein, Connor. Curtis,
D'AncWDwyer. Helms. Maguire. Reed. San
"oes-^HotalinK,' Jennings and McCarthy.
Absent Duboce. Fontana and Boxton.
This action was taken notwithstanding
the unfavorable majority report of the
Finance Committee signed by Jennings
and Hotaling and only after earnest pleas
had been made by Rev. Father Otis and
George S. Shadburne of St. Mary's Square
Association.
In an impassioned address to the board
Father Otis recited the history of the ap
propriation of the $125,00 for the park.
Father Otis' Appeal.
"The last board," said Father Otis,
"through my personal solicitation appro
priated the money with the express pro
vision that 1 would not allow it to be
uf=ed for any other purpose If 1 could pre
vent it. Unless you show us fair play we
will carry the light to the Supreme Court
and competent attorneys have assured us
we will win there. We have already ex
pended $1900 of our own money ln . this
project, and If there is such a thing as
justice we have a claim on you to carry
out the compact made by . your prede
cessors.
"As to the legal point we have tho opin
ion of the City Attorney that the fund
cannot be used for any other purpose.
The majority of this board has personally
declared itself to me as favoring the pro
ject. I ask you now to support us in re
moving a nuisance that has been in our
EXPENDITURES FOR 1SOC-1901.
Booth's Amendment Submit
ted to the Board of Su
pervisors. ,
Ordinance Extending Pound Limits
to County Line Passed to Print.
To Select Site for New
City Hospital.
â¢ >V ,
THE ordinance limiting the height of
fences for advertising purposes to
twenty feet was taken up at yester
day's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors and read without any recom
mendation from the joint Judiciary and
Street Committee to which it had
been referred. Brandenstein stated
that the vote in the committee
stood. three for. ten feet and three for
twenty feet. Booth moved to amend the
ordinance to read ten feet Instead of
twenty, as he regarded the lower height
the proper one. McCarthy questioned the
right of the board to restrict the height
of fences, but the Mayor said that the
latest Supreme Court decision held that It
was competent for municipal boards to
SO legislate.
M. Heller addressed the board on be
half of the billposters. Ht said It had
taken a number of. years to build up the
business, liepresentatives of paper fac
tories, ink houses and other industries had
testiiled in committee that their profits
would be cut in half If fences were limited
to ten feet in height. He asserted that the
property owners regarded the higher
rences as more sightly than a vacant lot.
Keed stated he was unwilling to vote
against the property Interests ot any one,
but he held that the pecuniary Interests
of a few people were aione opposed to the
best interests of the city. He argued that
the representations tnat jjreat losses
would result from a ten-foot fence ordi
nance were largely exaggerated. No doubt
the rates for advertising on the ten-foot
fences would be increased as an offset.
Booth's amendment limiting fences to
ten feet in height was adopted, with
Booth, Boxton, Connor, Curtis, D'Ancona,
Uwyer, Helms, Reed, Sanderson and To
bin voting aye, 'and Brandenstein, Comte,
Fontana, Hotaling, Jennings and Maguire
no. i
When the amended ordinance came up
for passage to print L. D. Owens made an
earnest- plea against it. Connor's amend
ment that the ordinance be amended to
go into effect Julyl, 1901, was lost and
Comte's motion to postpone consideration
for one week prevailed.
To Extend Pound Limits.
An ordinance providing for the exten
sion of the pound limits to certain streets
in the Excelsior Homestead district was
defeated after several taxpayers had been
heard ln behalf of the measure. Keed'a
amendment that the limits be extended
to the county line, to take effect on Janu
ary 1, 1901, was passed to print.
A communication was received from the
Board of Healthvadvising that the site
for the new City and County Hospital be
selected In some location situated away
from the thickly populated centers. Mc-
Carthy contended that, the health board
had not compiled in its communication
with the request that it recommend the
most suitable site of the several owned
by the city. Reed then moved that the
matter be resubmitted to the health board
with instructions to pick out the best
site and report. Dwyer amended to ex
clude the present hospital site from con
sideration, but the amendment was lost
lifter objections against It had been made
by Brandenstein. Dwyer said he was in
formed that the architects had stated that
the buildings would require eight acres
alone, and there were only nine acres in
the present location. Reed's motion that
the health board recommend a definite
site then prevailed. D'Ancona stated that
some months ago several Supervisors
and members of the Board of Health had
made a visit of Inspection and had agreed
that the site west of Dewey boulevard in
the Almshouse tract was the most" de
sirable of all.
License Ordinances Passed.
An ordinance was passed to print Im
posing a license of $6 per quarter on per
sons who sell merchandise- from station
ary wagons or stands on streets or side
walks; $6 per quarter on proprietors of
billiard and pool tables not kept exclu
sively for private use, and $6 per quarter

business; on hotels, boarding houses,
lodging houses and lestaurants whose

ing a license of $10 per quarter on everv

5 Miscellaneous Business.

sprinkling was unobjectionable.

ORDER LIMITING
FENCES TO TEN
FEET IN HEIGHT
JUDGE COOK has sustained the de
murrer of the cfty to the suits
against Hie cirQ service provisions
of the charter. In rendering his de
cision yesterday tho Judge paid hi.s nniid
had beta made up from c-arly in the argu
ment, but he .-i<1<3ed that he did not be
lieve the tiuei-tion submitted, affecting
original questions regarding the charter,
should be decided by any subordinate
court. He therefore dissolved the tempur
ory injunctions issued in the cases of
Cahen versus the Auditor and Bauer ver
sus the Civil Service Commission. An
appeal is already under preparation.
These actions were instituted for the
Â¦ purpose of determining- the constitution
ality of the provisions of the charter
establishing civil service in the various
departments of the municipal govern
ment. It was contended by the petition
ers in the action that the provisions were
Illegal in that they conflicted with that
etction of the constitution of California
limiting the tenure of public office to not
more than four years and also with the
general laws of the State. Upon the filing
vt the actions temporary injunctions were
Issued and the commission, with hands
tied, was forced to postpone proposed ex
aminations. That the merits of the con
troversy us to the constitutionality of the
civil service provisions might be deter
mined in the lower court, and if in the
opinion of the judpe presiding at the hear
ing the provisions were constitutional and
valid, that delay might nt^t result from
an appeal from a pro forma order, it was
tlecicu-d to argue the case before Judge
Cook and base future action on his de
cision. Judge Cook, however. Jailed to
pass ua the merits of the petitioners' con
tentions. He held that the case was a
proper one for original consideration by
the court of last resort and one upon the
merits of which a court of original juris
diction could not safely pass. Hence he
made the orders as above stated and the
case now stands as though <-6unsel had
remained .silent, save to take an excep
tion to a pro forma order sustaining the
demurrer and dissolving the Injunctions.
The labor of unraveling the legal taxigle
in consequence now rests with the Su
preme Cuurt.
The cases had progressed as far as Mc-
Erierneys argument last Friday, so no
.time was lost yesterday morning. Mc-
Euerney elaborated upon the point made
by the City Attorney in his opening ar
fcTiment, to the effect that even were the
tenure clause stricken from the charter
there would stili be left a complete and
legal system.
Taking up the question of appointment
and removal, he argued that the freehold
ers had the right to devise any method
of filling vacancies they saw Jit. and the
city might accept that method. He
claimed, too, that the lining of vacancies
under the civil service system is not so
much an appointment as a selection. It
had been decided in a case before the
Court of Appeals in New York, he said,
that selections Ly the Civil Service Com
mission did not come under the head of
appointments, and so the law of appoint
ment? did not affect them.
His principal points were that the pow
er to appoint might be delegated by the
Legislature to a Mayor or a Civil Service
Commission, or any one; that it did not
lirr finrflr rest in the head of the depart
ment where the vacancy occurs: that the
features of an office were three, the na
ture of the position itself, the salary at
tached and the tenure. It did not follow,
he argued, that if the feature of tenure
failed the others must fail also. and. fur
ther, that the power to appoint or select
Tested In the Civil Service Commission,
Â¦and as that commission also removed, the
clause was not ln opposition to the consti
tution.
Mr. McEnemey's argument was not a
long one. and as soon as he had finished
Judge Cook decided the case from the
bench. The case before him was the Bauer
case, in which it is sought to restrain the
Civil Service Commission from holding
competitive examinations. It was agreed,
however, that the liauer case and that of
Sol Cahen to compel the Auditor to audit
the demand of a certain official turned
out of office under the civil service pro
vislor. should go together. An order dis
missing the temporary writ in each case
was entered.

HEALTH BOARD SALARIES UNDER FIRE
CHARTER BOARD
OF HEALTH HAS
SEEN SUSTAINED
Judge Troutt. Finds Gage's
Appointees Have Not
Legal Title.
Alleged Right of Deposed Officials tc
Exercise Jurisdiction Over Ship
ping and Bay Counties Re
mains Undecided.
SAN* FRANCISCO'S Charter Board
of Health has been adjudged the
legal body, and that appointed by
Governor Henry T. Gage has been
declared Illegal and finally deposed from
office, its duties' and accruing benefits.
Judge Troutt handed down a decision
yesterday sustaining- a demurrer Inter
posed to the petition filed by Dr. William
M. Lawlor, health officer of the Gage
board, ln which he sought to remove the
charter board from office and enjoin' its
members from asserting any claim or title
thereto. Although the opinion gives the
petitioner the right to amend his plead
ings, this formality will not be taken ad
vantage of, for the merits of the entire
controversy as to the board proper have
been adjudicated.
One point, however, as yet remains un
decidedâthat is whether or not the Gage
board has the right to still exist for the
purpose of enforcing quarantine regula
tions throughout the bay counties and
in regard to shipping. Action will be filed
with the object of determining this point
and then flnal Judgment by the Supreme
Court will forever quiet the title to the
contested office.
Judge Troutt's opinion in part reads:
A Conflict Arises. {
When the charter of this city and county be
came fully operative on January S, 1D00, a con
nect occurred between the former Hoard of
Health which had been appointed by the Gov
erncr of this State and the new board appoint
ed by the Mayor of this city and county under
and by virtue of the provisions of the charter.
The former board, although seriously objecting,
was obliged ' to yield to the new board, and
thereupon Instituted this proceeding.
The constitution of this State provides that
a freeholders' charter, when ratified by the re
quired number of electors and approved by the
legislature, shall become the organic law of
the municipality and supersede any existing
charter and all .amendments thereof and all
laws inconsistent with such charter.
Our constitution also -provides that a charter
framed or adopted by authority of the consti
tution, except in municipal affairs, shall be
subject to and controlled by general laws.
The charter of this city and county provides
for a "Department of Public Health," under
the management of a Board of Health. The
board consists of seven members, who are to
serve without compensation, five of whom are
appointed by the Mayor, the other two members
being- the Chief of Police and the president of
the Board of Public Works.
Our Political Code Fpecially provides for a
Board of Health for this city and county, con
sisting of the Mayor and four other resident
members, appointed by the Governor. The
board shall elect a Health Officer for the city
nnd county and port of San Francisco, who
shall be the executive officer of the Health De
partment, x he board must appoint a Quaran
tine Officer and certain other officers and em
ployes, as directed by section 3009.
The Quarantine Officer.
The Quarantine Officer is"requlred to perform
very important duties, and is Invested with
very Important powers ln connection with ves
sels entering the harbor or port of San Fran
cisco when subject to quarantine pr examina
tion. He also | has very important duties to
perform within the city and county.
Now it Is contended by the relator that sani
tary matters are not "municipal affairs" within
the meaning of the constitution, and that the
code provisions concerning- the appointment of
a Hoard of Health of the city and county of
Pan Francisco constitute a "general law," and
hence, that by reason of section 6 of article XI
of the constitution the charter Board of Health
must yield to the statutory Board of Health
It is further contended by the relator that
Â¦while the State may temporarily delegate ot
transfer its power and control over sanitary
matters which may affect the public health
throughout the State, yet It cannot irrevocably
surrender such power arid control as would re
sult if the charter provisions concerning sani
tary matters be held to deal with municipal
affairs and hence be beyond the control of gen
eral laws.
We find that pur constitution Itself provider
that a municipality may make and enforce
within Its limits all such local, police, sanitarj
and other regulations as are not ln conflict
with general laws. We- also find that our Poli
tical Code (section 3059) provides that the Board
of Supervisors of any county ln which there Is
even a port of entry or harbor, "for which
there is not otherwise provided health and
quarantine regulations" may by an ordinance
adopt the whole or any part of the provisions ot
article III of said code, entitled, "Health and
quarantine regulations for the city and count}
and harbor of San Francisco," appoint a Board
of Health or Health Officer, locate quarantine
grounds when necessary and provide for the
enforcement, of health and quarantine regula
tions.
May Be Enforced.
' Evidently, therefore, the aforesaid provisions
that concern health matters are properly Incor
porated In cur charter and may be enforced,
unless It is that they do not pertain to "muni
cipal affairs," ln the technical sense, and are
controlled and Invalidated by the aforesaid
provisions of the Political Code relative to
health matters in this city and county.
I am of the opinion that the provisions of the
code in question do not constitute a "general
law" and do constitute- a "local law." within
the meaning of tho constitution, such as can
not control the urovisions of the charter when
Inconsistent therewith.
A Point Undetermined.
My final conclusion Is that the act of the
Legislature In recording- Its flnal approval or
our charter ln the mode prescribed by the con
stitution has, in pffect. modified if not re
pealed the statutory provisions that refer spec
ially to this city anil county in regard to the
appointment of a Board of Health, Us Juris
diction and Us powers and duties, and thai
thereby the Legislature, us the representative
of the State, has delegated a portion of th9
sovereign power of the State to this munici
pality. ,. .
As the charter Board of Health may. ln my
opinion, exercise within the limits of the muni
cipality the powers conferred upon it by the
charter, it is unnecessary and not within the
issue for this court now to determine whether
or not the code Board of Health may ap
point a quarantine officer and exerclso Juris
diction over the port and harbor of San Fran
cisco and the. quarantine grounds at the anchor
ape of Sausallto, as required by certain sections
of our Political Code.
Accordingly, the defendant's demurrer is sus
tained on the ground that the complaint does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cau.Â«e
of action, and overruled as to every other
cround.
