In my room and create the impression that*
he had Jumped overboard to account for
i..s disappearance. He would then have a
better opportunity to land at Vera Cruz.'
I explained to him that the wardrobe was
so small. that he could neither stand erect
nor sit ..down, but that it was the only
reasonably safe place of hiding, as the
secret would then be known to us only.
He agreed to this plan and said his motto
was 'Fortuna audax Juvat."

" "Early w^the - next Â¦ morning
we- steamed Into Vera Cruz.
The health officer was, of course,
the first person to come on board."
As he came up. the steps I drew Zamora
aside and: whispered, 'General Diaz Is on
board. Take the health officer's boat and
carry the news to General Enriquez and
tell him 5 to send some one Immediately.*
Zamora up 'Â¦ to this time supposed that
Diaz had drowned at Tamplco, but he did
not stop to ask needless questions or ex
press his Joy, he Just obeyed. General En
riquez was on the wharf when he landed,
and in a few minutes a lighterman came
alongside the Havana, with a note from
him.; telling. me -.to send the box of arms
with the bearer. ' I ; showed this note to
Diaz . and, we decided upon the following:
plan. He was to disguise himself In a suit
of the house boatman's clothes which I
secured, follow me down into the steerage,
help the stevedores roll a bale of cotton
on the . lighter which General. Enriquez
had sent and Jump out wlth.it into the
lighter. I would watch and when that
had been accomplished cast off the line
and let the tide carry the lighter beyond
reach. It would then be an easy matter
for them to land.'/;
"While we, were talking a 'rap came at
the door.. -Diaz leaped into the closet, and
I opened the door to find the colonel there.;
He said he 'was ; willing to abide by"; the
agreement of the night before, but that he
had been authorized j to offer me $50,000 in
cash if I would show .him by a sign where
General Diaz ;was 'concealed. * I told : him
that r he kr^ew i the ;â¢ general had â¢ Jumped

" 'John.' 1 said to my neighbor, "what
are the girls here for. to make the room
look pretty?*
"It seemed incredible that any one could
think' a girl capable' of learning 1 along
with her brother. It is. considered a dis
grace likewise for a man to walk publicly
with a woman', even though she be his
sister. She may entertain men callers,
and of course, her face la never covered,
like a Turkish woman's, . but her mother
or some older female relative is always
present. They attend the same enter
tainments and church, but may not sit to
gether. The woman's seats in church
are partitioned off and are in the rear.
Â¦ "while among many old Armenian fam
ilies parents contract for the marriage of
their children while they are. in their in-'
fancy, in the majority of cases the young
people are permitted to make their own
" selections, though always with the .con
sent of theirt parents. Elopements, theje
. fore,' are unknown. The marriage tie Is
eacred in Armenia, and death only can
break it- If a person has an uncongenial
; companion he must endure it with tha
same kind of patience he would endure a
.sore head, which, though he may try to
i cure, \ he will hardly cut off.

â¢ "The conduct .demanded of a newly mar
ried Armenian woman will strike Ameri
cans as very singular Indeed," said An
tranlg Azhderlan. a young Armenian
whose book. "The Turk and.- the Land oC
Hale." has recently been published. "S*i-> -
titters never a word except when alone
with her husband, until after tne birth of
htr first child. Then she Is allowed to
talk to her child. A little Later she is per
mitted to converse with her mother-in
law: still later her own mother may again
hear her voice, . and before a great while
she will speak In whispers to the young
rirls Â«of her household. She must not
leave the house during the first -year of
her married life, except to attend church.
Her discipline as a bride terminates after
six years, but she will never again open
her lips to a man unless he be her kins
man. Young: girls are allowed to hava a
liberty of conduct that la In striking con
trast. They chatter freely and cheerfully
with whom they please.
"The. Armenian woman differs radically
from her Turkish sisters. Neither seclu
ilon. nor polygamy, nor divorce darkens "
3er present or threatens her future. ShÂ»
Is not educated with her brothers, how
ever, as American girls. I remember how;
puzzled I was when I entered an Amerl-
Che last time.' After rehearsing thÂ» part
he was to play, he asked for a piece of
paper and began to write. .When I asked
him what he was doing he said. 'I can do
as much for you as that colonel.':- I took
the paper and tore It Into bits- and told
him that the colonel was only .doing his
duty, but that he, Diaz, had no right to
insult me; that. I would not risk my Ufa
for money. " His eyes, filled with tears and,
throwing his arms about my neck ho said
that we were brothers. *
"We were now ready.. I opened the door
and began abusing- him in Spanish. HÂ«
followed, using the slouching gait of tnÂ«*
boatman. When we reached the foot oÂ£l
the stairs the lighterman asked* "Where. t
Is the box of arms?* I pointed to the gen
eral. The man sprang, forward, raised thÂ»
general's hat and recognized him by thÂ« I
tuft of white hair on his forehead. The. "
lighterman was overwhelmed with fear
and begged -me to hide his friend In tha
machinery and premised to come for him.
at nlsht. I knew that* within three hours
a cordon of .soldiers would guard the boat
and that no one could leave unnoticed and
Insisted upon his following out the erigi
.nal plan. Diaz was the embodiment or
nerve and carried out the stratagem ex
actly as planned.- Â¦
"Meanwhile the soldiers were being dis
embarked and in spite of the., colonel's
command the rumor that General Dla.3
was on board spread. The chief" of pollca
and all the officers of the port searched
the ship thoroughly. I turned over all IBs
general's effects to them except a gold
chain which he wished me to give his wife
as a proof that what I should tell her was
true. By the by, this chain I wear Is that
very chain. Mrs. Diaz gave it to me as a
token of her gratitude because It .was the
most, cherished heirloom in- the" family."
Diaz got ashoret safely, mads his way
to' Oaxaca en foot, organized an army and
defeated the forces cf Lerdo atTecoac HÂ»
wrote Mr. Coney a letter from this battle
field and invited "him to come to Mexico..
Mr. Coney accepted .and the reception hÂ»
received was worthy -a king.

One of "the most interesting things In
Paris tobehold is the great market. The

four enormous buildings, each one about
t the size of the Mechanics'. Pavilion .in our
city. '.; One; is- for i meat,",. the others * for
poultry, fish, 'fruit .and. = vegetables. 'The
markets :and , the products presented) are
certainly, done up in a style that. is en
tirely" French. they ;have is
good; but the ; singular thing; about mar
keting here Is that when you make a pur

are told. "Oh. no, this man takes it." And

quest of a poor Englishman for an Amer

prefers to marry the penniless American
to whom she has been allotted since

"The Greatest Gift."
A story which is not wholly bad. but
which at- times sinks to the level of the
sensationally absurd, Is "The Greatest
Gift," by A. W. Marchmont. The leading
incident of tho book is the sacrifice a wo
man makes by engaging herself to a man
she does not love in order to please some
one she does love. The minor occurrences
come as a result of the heroine's act,
which entangles her life and the lives of
those about her into the maze of compli
cations which usually follows this -well
worn choice of the novelist to win sympa
thy for his heroine by Involving her In
the deep trouble from which his skill alona
can successfully extricate her.

original work of the kind published In this
country on a subject that is attracting
more and more attention the world over.
The books on horseless vehicles issued on
the other side of the ocean, although val
uable in their way, do not really meet the
wants of the American reader. The mo
tors and vehicles constructed in the
United States have to be built on princi
ples that do, not obtain, to an equal de
gree, in countries where the roads, cli
mate, etc., are radically different. On
that account It is a pleasure to peruse
a work written by Americans for Ameri
cans. It is clear, simple and complete
avoiding any excess of technicalities and
still describing with full accuracy the
leading types of autoniobiles now. on the
market. The publishers have, been very
careful not to allow any particular tlrm
of builders, to be recommended at the ex
pense of the others. Every system gaso
line, steam, electricity, is exhaustively
discussed and illustrated. - the author's
opinion being given fearlessly as to tho
relative value of each. Over 100 cuts "ren
der the explanations easy to follow and
understand. The rules and regulations
adopted by leading cities in the country
for the safe handling of automobiles on
ties. He cites the reform forces In New
York and says: "They are merchants,
lawyers, doctors, professors, clergymen,
uie respectability and intelligence of the
town; and so far as self-government goes
they are the tattered children of tyranny.
Good God. what an army! At the first
trumpet they scatter. One sells out, one
recants, one disappears. They are any
where or nowhere; a ship of fools, a barn
yard." In another place he says: "You
cannot hitch your horse to anything with
out helping to drag the Juggernaut. Be
fore you know it, virtue is pocketed. Take
the most obvious case. The reformers im
agine they are in politics and must win
at all costs^ One enthusiast calls twenty

A Story of Wales.
Allen Rame has written a charming tale
of the Welsh coast In^'Garthowen," a re
cent Issue of Appleton's Town and Coun
try Library. The novel's interest depends
not upon complication of plot, but upon
ibe inviting picture '.It gives of the at
tractions of a 'simple country life on the
moors by the sea. The beauty of an un
worldly life Is brought out into relief the
more clearly by glimpses of lives which
are bereft of simplicity by devotion to the
pursuit of wealth and fame; "i
The story opens In a seaport town and
"Introduces us to one of the leading char
acters,' Gethln Owen. wÂ«.o after leading a
wandering life as a seaman since being
turned from his home for some childish
-prank. Is about to return- to seek his
â¢father's forgiveness. Wi.cn he meets "his
â¢family once more he Is welcomed with de
light. He falls Into his old place on his
father's farm with no regrets for the life
he has forsaken. Gethin's younger broth
er. Will, the father's favorite, dislikes
his. position as the son of a poor man, and
â¢ the simple form of Methodism which his
family professes, of both' of which ' he Is
secretly ashamed, so he persuades his
father to allow him to enter a seminary
of the Church of England that he may
take holy orders and be given a. chance to
gain the place of honor for which he longs.
When Will leaves home Gethin grows to
be. a .greater comfort and help to his
father. But suddenly he disappears with

"Jim Wardner of Wardner, Idaho," is
the curious title bl a book. It is the reci
tal of Mr.. Wardner's experiences as a
pioneer in the various mining districts.
And although it savors of an advertise

own popularity makes one admire a char
acter so thoroughly unique. No mining
center has been neglected, for Mr. Ward

birthplace. Milwaukee, to I the Pacific
Sicpe; from Cape Nome to South Africa.
He tells of the fortunes he has made and
lest in a most ingenuous way, and re
counts with charmiqg crudeness anec
dotes of pioneer tiays that are now his
toric- ....
Mr. Wardner is a foremost man in the
history of mining and much useful in
formation ' can be gained from his book.
The last chaptor on Cape Nome will be
especially' inbtructive at this time, when
facts and figures about that country are

Who's Who in America.
A book that should prove Invaluable on

by John W. Leonard. If gives us thou
tniids of biographical sketches of the lives
of prominent Americansâ men and women
great In this his first venture, which often
betrays the hand of an amateur.
His delineation of some characters la
very good. The most cleverly-drawn are
SIgnor Somato, a "dago" banker, and his
wife Bridget, who Is a- delightful picture
of contentment amidst the most distress
ing financial disturbances. The' stpry
opens in Genoa, where Mr. Thomas gives
one too hasty a glance of a picturesque
country he knows so well after his years
of travel in Italy.
The scene changes at once to New York,
where one Is introduced to the heroine,
"The Last Lady of Mulberry." She Is
neither; an attractive nor original type,
but one that can be found daily in any
Bohemian quarterâ a loud, unprepossess
ing creature who Is not worth the time a
clever man should spend on his central
figure.
It Is evidently Mr. Thomas* purpose to
present a truthful picture of an alien col
ony'in New York, but as a romance it Is
flimsy and uninteresting. . The characters
are not strong enough to, form the dra
matis personae of a good novel, and when
one has finished the book he cannot ( help
wondering why Mr. Thomas wrote It.
Mr. Pollak, the artist, has carefully il

A Story of the American Revo
lution. :
- A romance. of colonial times, which con
tains a very pretty love story, has been
written by Mary Devereux. It Is the tale
of the love of a British officer for the
daughter of a family who entered heart
and soul into the movement to free the
colonies. The heroine, a most engaging
little rebel, shares fully her kinsmen's po
litical views, and takes a more active part
than most girls in furthering thorn; so
when she finds her hatred for England re
solving itself Into love for one of its
emissaries, her heart seems nigh breaking
fn the conflict between inclination and
duty. Fortunately, she lived at a time
when Washington was all-powerful, and
consistently with the kindness with which
history credits him, he uses his kind of
fices in behalf of the little American girl,
and. makes It possible for her to keep the
respect of her family and still to marry
the man of her choice. If weighed in the
balance with some other, recent novels
whose scene has been laid at the same
period of our history, this one will be
found somewhat wanting, and as pre
eminently a love tale with little aid for its
Interest In the historic settine. But if
particular industries to which they are
devoted. From the continual publication
in that way of the facts, figures and fore
casts of the trade of tne country, it would
appear but little has been left for any
further statement on the subject, and yet
Mr. Ray Stannard Baker, by compiling
all the evidences of prosperity In every
branch of business and in every section
of the Union into one volume, has made
a book full of interest and Information.
It is In no respect a campaign book got
up for political effect, and yet It is as ex
cellent a vindication of the administration
as could be put forward, since It briners
fully before the reader- the; marvelous
growth of the welfare of the American
people since the adoption of the princi
ples of protection and sound money.
It is to be noted that Mr. Baker has
managed to handle the great mass of sta
tistics. In his volume without wearying the
reader. . It is not a mere compilation of
figures, but a well written book, interest
ing as well a3 Instructive. Moreover, the
optimism of the author does not blind him
to the fact that every wave of prosperity
!s bound to have Its reaction, and that in
the natural course of events we shall have
over-speculation which will tend to bring
new panics. At present, however, there
is nd cloud upon the horizon. As Mr.
Baker says: "There seems to be no doubt
that the financial question ts about to drop
out of politics, and that the country will
place Itself flrml" and permanently on a
foundation of Bound money. * * * More

BOOK REVIEWS
4The other night -we drove over to the
"old gates of Paris, where the Gingerbread
or Kaster fete Is being held. It took us
some hours to see all that was worth see
in 1 ?, and when we returned we found our
coachman in rebellion. He had partaken
of several drinks of absinthe and con
cluded that we were English, and as the
Frenchman is pro-Boer the coachman re
fused to return us to our hotel unless we
consented to pay. treble the usual fare.
It did not take long for a mob to gather,
and the cries of "Throw the English In
the Seine" were very numerous. We tried
to persuade them that we were Ameri
cans, but they would not accept it until
one of the party who happened to have a
small silk American flag in his pocket
took it out and waved It. Then they gave
vent to a loud"Ah-h: If they are Ameri
cans, all right, but . if you find they are
English drop them out before you get
home." Speaking of the Easter feast or
Gingerbread Sidewalk Show, as it is
known here, this is beyond the dream or

the public streets, covering a space of
nearly three miles, up one street and
down another, in the public squares, in
fact, covering every space of ground with

gingerbread, confections of all kinds,
fruit, lotteries, shooting galleries, ball

shows and at least a hundred merry-go
rounds, with every kind of conceivable
animal to ride, and likewise vehicles.
The most gorgeously constructed merry
go-rounds the human eye ever beheld are
run by steam or electricity, as It may
happen to be constructed. Some of these
merry-go-rounds cost as much as $130,000.

dents, their quarter is a very Interesting
one. It is divided Into two parts of the
city, the artists mainly living hear . the
New Hippodrome. You can tell one as

and selected by the different artists walk
up and down, awaiting employment. You
will see the artists standing here and
there,. while these young women or ath
letically built young men or old and very
grotesque looking persons, who know
their value as subjects, pass to and. fro.
and the majority of the models usually,
find employment for the day. The stu

money enough to pay his model. On tha
other side of the city is what Is known
as the Latin quarter. Four. o'clock is tha

the Casino de Paris, occasionally going to
the Moulin Rouge to see the high kick

All these places I have mentioned have
large foyers where music Is dispensed dur

women who have no moral standing pa
rade themselves, gowned in attlre3 that
simply dazzle the eye. Their fashion has
no equal; their gowns are the perfection
of the modiste, and it would seem at first
sight that there was no art in dressing
that could exceed them, but In this tho
stranger will find himself mistaken, be
cause if you trip over to Maxim's, a rotls
serie of fame in Paris just at this mo
ment, where all the titled gentry and
swelldom that come to Paris go after mid
night, there the very Ideals, who are
noted for exquisite gowning, and Jewels,
can be seen In great profusion. Such even
ing dresses are seldom dreamt of as can
be seen here. For beautiful day gowns
one must attend the. races. On a fine af
ternoon the gowns that are worn by tha
women who attend are marvels of art and,
beauty, and the cost 'of the' same is much
more proportionately here in Paris than
it would be in any part of the United
States, made by equally first-class gown
makers.
The sports and the gay life of Paris, to

Sergeant "Tommy" Ellis is an efficient
officer of the present harbor police force.
At one time Mr. Ellis had no aspirations
. for wearing the -brass buttons, but they
camo to him through an accident, or rath
er through a spontaneous act of courage
and daring, which was not done for glory
or the hope of reward, but simply for the
assistance of a fellow "man. Chief Lees
having been informed of a diamond rob-
bcry and that the thief was making an
attempt to dispose of the jewels, had gone
â¢ Into a pawnshop at the corner of Kearnv
'find Bush streets and accosted the thief.
j The man. who had taken the diamonds
from a house on Van Ness avenue, -im
mediately assaulted Chief Lees and began
a \ desperate fight, which because of its
unexpectedness might have been fatal to
Lees but for. the interference of Ellis.
"Tommy" Ellis was a good-natured
plumber, going home from his work Â¦with
a piece of lead pipe over his shoulder,
whistling a merry tune and not looking
for adventure of apy kind. As he passed
the door of the pawnshop ho saw the
struggle, recognized Chief Lees, and leap
ea to the rescue, taking the fight into his
own hands. A blow, with the load pipe
on- the head of the thief brought that
person to the floor and "Tommy" Ellis
modestly -.touched - his <nat and- prepared
to resume his way. Chief Lees, however,
thanked the plumber warmly, lauding his
courage and bravery, and the next week
Mr. Ellis was uniformed and brass-button
ed, a fully equipped policeman. Soon af
terward he was made a sergeant, and for
years he has Â¦ been

portunity'that gave, the officers In these
few instances a chance to distinguish
themselves. There are many others as
daring and as brave who. would be equal
to the opportunity should it present Itself.
"They, are all. .of necessity.- brave men,"
says Mr. Seymour, captain of police, "be
cause if they are not a charge of coward

dismissal and cowardice is reckoned from
a negative standpoint as well as from tha
positive. It is the duty of. every officer
to enter into any disturbance near him

not do- so promptly he is Liable to dis
missal. On the occasion of the . recent

and Cronin. and the two policemen who
made the arrest, another officer was
standing by and he Is now held to answer
to a charge of cowardice for not taklss

So the position of the policeman, serene.
blue-coated and brass buttoned, cannot
properly be termed a "snap." Though it
is hi.s duty to assist ladles across tho car

a newsboys' altercation, there are also
other duties less trivial, in the. fulfillment

quietly stepped down the ladder and land
ed squarely on the back of the Industrious
burglar. When he had subdued the crim
inal he marched him to the front door,
gave- the alarm and turned his prisoner
over to the prison officials. Just what the
sergeant would have done had he found
two or three armed accomplices down
there standing guard when he attacked
the burglar is a matter for conjecture, but
It Is safe to say that he would have given
them a. hard tight.
An unsophisticated 'Australian, while
visiting San Francisco a decade ago, fell

doers. Jack Robinson, a notorious colored
crook and an ex-convict, assisted by a

California wine and enticed him into a
lodging-house, where they gave him a se
vere beating and relieved him of a gold
watch and some $400 In cash, after which
they threw him from the window. The
resulting thud was somewhat sobering in
effect and the penniless Innocent called
to the officer who was on the beat, relat
ing his troubles. The officer. Harry Rey
nolds, saw the negro leave the house and
enter a saloon. Reynolds followed an.I

colored, man attacked Reynolds with a

a little French politeness It is simply mar
velous and delicious. The meanest thing
you can call a Frenchman is "cochon,"'
and this is frequently called from one to
the other; pumpkinhead is another very
general expression. The advertised riding
prices for the public cabs are very rea
sonable, until you take the ride and the
cocher gets through figuring it out for
you. While talking of riding here in
Paris, let me suggest to the pedestrian
who does not ride, that if you get run
over here you are immediately arrested
and punished for getting In the way of
the horse, and if any damage is done you
are liable In law for whatever happens to
the horse or the coach for permitting

Pirnitz's opinion was accepted as the

the school room to call' them. For her
eelf. Fhe -relied upon Georgette Vincent, a
former pupil of the Assistance Publique,
a. vivacious, affectionate and intelligent
girl, who had been her favorite for a long
time. Pirnitz designated the little monl
tress Alexandrine; Frederique a. pretty.
eedate little rr^nette named Ninette Van

call Alice Aubry one of the oldest girls

Before leaving their rooms they counted
up the; resources at their disposition.
When their purses had' been reunited they
found that they had three hundred francs.
.But .Lea and .Frederique possessed about
twenty-live hundred francs in the bank,
the savings of former. days. P.irnitz had
a thousand francs of her own.-a little nest
egg, saved from old lessons. Daipy was
the only one who possessed absolutely
Â¦nothing. The instant" she received her
salary she always .Â«per.t it in charity.
It was after half-past 7 when a heavy
cab, which the -patenerper went for to a
thnery stable in St. Charles, bore the four
wnmen away from' the house where they
had Fpent the best of their Intelligence
and their energy during so many month;'.
While the-oid and uncomfortable cab was
Joltinjr them from St. Charles to the Rue
du Faubourg St. Honore they hardly
spoke to each other. Huddling together,
they felt all the iniquity of the social
power that was oppressing them. Fred
erique. Pirnitz -and even Daisy meditated
how they were to recommence the battle.
Lea was the only one of the four who
bowed before her destiny, who gave up
the tipht and all hopes of vengeance. She
was absorbed by this thought.
"No. I cannot return to that house In
the Ruo de la Sourdiere and see Pirnitz's
room ajrain! I will not enter it! I would
rather die! Cut what am I to do?"
She railed all her intelligence to her aid.
"Well, if I must. I will tell Frederiquo
everything when we arrive at the Rue de
la Pourdiere.' 1 want to be free, as Pirnitz
says. 1 will have the liberty that suits
me â the liberty that I need."
She made the resolution: "As soon as
the cab reaches the Place de la Concorde
I will tell them the truthâ that I am leav
ing them and returning to England."
Hut before they had crossed the Pont
des Invalifies Frederique gave Lea the 300
francs they had reunited.
"You must be our treasurer. Pay the
cab, and while we are going upstairs with
orr valises buy something for dinner."
"Yes." paid I>ea. who was always domi
nated by her sis=ter. And she did not speak
of her intention.
â¢ When, the cab stopped before the old
houte, petrified in its century old immo
bility, the old Directoiro house, where the
two riFtrn* had first seen the light. Lea
felt a thrill of horror and hatred. It
seemed to her that this house was the
causo.of everything. She had been born
there in s!ia:r.e; Bhe had fallen under two
evil influence? thereâ that of Frederique
and that of Pirnitz. She was glad of the
pretext that Frederique's orders gave her
to avoid entering it.
"I shall be back :n a few moment*," she
said to her three companions as they went
Into the ccrridor with their little packets.
The cabrr.an could not change a 20-franc
piece. Â¦ . '
'"Take me to n tobacconist," said Lea,
getting into the cab ajeain. Â¦
The Dearest shop was at the corner of
the Rue du Faubourg. Lea bought a
carte lettre. wrof a few words upon it,
slimed into it a . SO-frnnc note. .sealed it
and wrote her sister's name upon it.
Xow that she was alone, bevond the
gaze of the two dominators of her will,
she recovered a marvelous faculty of de
cision. :, 'Â¦ -: y
"Fifty francs." she thought, "will bo
enough for them until to-morrcw. and I
have given them my share of the 2000
francs in the bank."
She got into the cab again and told the
man to drive to St. Augustine's Church.
She had decided to Ftart that evening for
London by way of Dieppo and N'cwhave,
hut she flid not wish to lfave the cab at
the St. Lazare station. As she got out at
the foot of the broad steps that lead up
to the church she gave the carte lettre
to the cabman. ; :Â¦ - t
"Take this letter to 21 Rue de la Sour
tfiere. Give It to the concierge, and say
that it Is very urgent." .
She gave the man an ample tip, and
h? raid:
"Thank?, madame. You may rely upon
nip. The commission will be well done."
Tho found of an organ issued from the
church, which was lit for evening ser
vice. Lea mounted the steps. When she
arrived at the top she turned, followed
with her gaze the cab, which turned and
drove away, its heavy frame shaken and
jolted over the wooden pavement.
It was about 8 o'clock in the evening.
The brightness of the gas lamps was still
overpowered by the twilight.- The cab
turned into the Boulevard Malesherbea
and disappeared.
Lea then entered the church. Before
beginning her voyage she felt the need of
prayer and of solitude. For so many
months she had never prayed! But: her
primitive soul, oppressed for so long, was
awakening. :
CHAPTER I.
BOOK THE TULLJiD.
The express had passed Chatellerault.
It was now flying along toward Tours,
across faintly undulating plains, where
verdant fields and stubble from the recent
harvest alternated with brown stretches
of plowed land prepared for the approach
ins seeding. White houses, roofed with
Touraine slate; country stations, that
suddenly vanished in a throbbing of elec
tric bpilsj now and again the peaked tur
rets of a chatpfiu, that pierced through
the yellow woodland; from time to tlmt
a village gathered In the depths of a val
ley around the parish steeple. Central
France unrolled its landscape for kilome
ter after kilometer before the eyes of
Frederique, in mourning, sitting in the
corner of a second-class carriage. An
other person occupied the compartment
with her, a nun in a violet dress, who
sleeping in an uncomfortable position, as
the devout sleep at the church, erect and
unbending, against the back of the car
riage, the beads of her rosary softly
clinking between her relaxed Â¦ fingers,
the wings of her white cornette gently
fanning her reposeful, colorless, express
ionless face. . ,
Frederique was returning with 'Sister
Odi!e from one of those hurried compul
sory journeys, during which the eyes
watch with a vacant gaze the objects
that pass before them, because the Jour
ney has. so to speak, torn the soul from
bitter cares which will have to be faced
apain after the return.
Two days before, in company with the
fat servant Maria, they had left Paris
for a village named Poudenats, in the
Gers. escorting a fourth traveller, who re
quired an entire compartment for the
journey, for her poor body, for
ever motionless, was contained* In a
coffin as small as that of a child. Mile.
de Salnte-Parade had died suddenly and
painlessly on -September .- 17. " less .. than
three months after the stroke of paraly
sis which had prostrated, her the day
of her ruin, and two months after the
appropriation of the school by the .state.
She had died In the modest lodging,
which she inhabited with Sister Odile
and faithful Maria, near St. Clothilde's
Church. After her death, by the advice
of Maria, they had telegraphed to a
nephew of the deceased, the last survivor
of the Sainte-Parade family, who lived
in the Gers. He had replied that he
was ill and could not come to Paris, but
he begged the nun to bring the body to
Poudenats for burial.
Maria returned to her natal place with
her dead mistress. At the burial Freder
ique represented the work to which Mile.
Sainte-Parade had devoted a part of her
life and all her fortune. Pirnita and
Daisy, living with Frederique in tHe Rue
de la Sourdiere since their expulsion, had
stayed in. Paris for economical reasons.
In' addition, Daisy would not leave Paris,
for Germaine had just been seriously ill
with peritonitis at the St. Lazare Hos
pital,-and Pirnitz felt that she was, neces
sary to Daisy. . When the funeral was
over Maria stayed at Poudenats in the
service of Mile.- Sainte-Parade's nephew,
a little old man, half helpless with rheu
matism. Sister Odile was returning to
Paris, which she would leave almost im
mediately for Alsace, where she intended
to make a retreat in her- convent at
Thann. "-. â¢
-. Thus the companions of an enthusiastic
movement, which had been rudely inter
rupted by masculine hostility, were being
scattered one by one. â¢ .
'Â¦' Frederique was lost in the melancholy
caused by this dispersion, while the train
sped along the rails through autumnal
Touraine. The sky was clouded, with fre-:
quent gleams of light, when a watery sun
pilvered the woods, paths and fields. Fred
erique could not help comparing the fer
vor of her former hopes with the emptl-'
ness of the results. Oh! her studious,
concentrated infancy, her ardor to purify
the sullied home! .What an 1 influence she
had exercised, even as a child,, over- her
mother; over her grandfather. Legay. and
6ver her young sister! Then her meolx

tiation into' emancipatory doctrines, her
sojourn in London accompanied by Lea.

all those years of childhood and youth
nothing had really been lacking to form
"stranger like," brought by tha cabman
when, Daisy, Pirnlta and Frederique her
eelf were beginning to be anxious at tha
long absence of Lea:
"My dear Fedi: I am no longer of any
use among you now that the Work is de
stroyed. My dutyâ I feel itr-ls to rejoin
him who suffers far from me. I wish to
avoid farewells, and perhaps discussion;
and it is for that reason that I have not
spoken of my project to any one, but it
has been decided upon for a Ions . time.
Forgive me. Listen to your own heart
and you will understand.. I , leave you
my share â¢ of the two thousand francs
which belongs to us. May it help you to
live through the moments of difficulty
that you are going to experience. Fare
well, Frederique! I thank you for all you
have done for me! I thank Romalne. I
kiss Daisy, Pirnitz and you.
"Your sister who will love you always.
"LEA."
She had been forced to read this letter,
to have it read by Daisy and Pirnitz, who
were waiting anxiously. Frederique. then
felt a shame so terrible that It even sur
passed the pain of separation. Such had
been her shame as a child the day she
understood the infamous bargain conclud
ed by her mother with the d'Ubzacs.
When Pirnitz tried to console her. she re
plied: "Don't speak to- me of her, Ro
maine. Never speak of her againâ never,
never." '
With feverish activity she had imme
diately gone abcut the work of their In
stallation in the narrow cell where, with
Lea. she had felt formerly the spirit de
scend upon their sisterly union.
Thus the original troop of Noble Maid
ens was now reduced to Pirnitz and Fred
erique. The most painful feature of the
defection was that the deserters, at first
anxious to combnt the masculine domln
ator. had all, with the exception of Daisy,
finally yielded to masculine domination by
an act; of spontaneous abdication. A sad
dening truth imposed itself upon Fred
erique's lucid mind: the actual powerless
ness of -women surged forth from these
voluntary defections. Duramberty's vic
tory, the spoilation of the foundresses by
the governing powers, were incidents of
a political order, and consequently only
provisional incidents, which left the field
open for the revendtcations of the future.
But how much more disquieting, in an
ancient social order, was this incapacity
of woman to shake off the yoke of her
tyrant! Hardly was she free when It
seemed as though she had nostalgia for
her chains.
The entire history of the school demon
strated this: Mllo. Hcurteau bowed be

cial posts: Duyvecke accepted servitude,
vanquished by an obscure yearning for
othar. It iÂ» not difficult, but one must

were only obedience to the orders of the
Mother Superior, anxious that the healtn
of her daughters should not be exhausted
too quickly, that the terrible mortality
of religious communities might spare
them ai least until the normal period,
when, as Sister Odile said. "God called
them to him early."
A little. beyond Etampes the sister, hay
ing kissed her crucifix a last time again
settled down In the corner of the carriage,
closed her eyes and fell asleep almost im
mediately. The lamp overhead was light
ed Outside was the thick humid dark
ness of autumn. Frederique lo , w^ d - 4he
window a little and shaded the lamp. She
had no wish to sleep. .She had lost her
regular slumber of former times long ago.
She wished to recapitulate, in the sooth
ing calm of this rapid flight through the
darkness, what she had to do once she
were back in Paris.
She was going to Daisy and Â£ lrâ¢tf-
Oh! how she longed, in union with those
two unselfish, devoted and courageous
women) to recommence the Work, and.
like birds whose nest has been destroyed
by the storm, like the tree whose branches
have been pruned, to put put fresh
boughs, to build the nest again bravely
and faithfully. After a very short period
of distress, when Lea deserted them.
Frederique had realized' that Pirnitz
Bpoke truly, that her duty and salvation,
and also the remedy for despair, necessi
tated an obstinate recommencement of
tho Work. To rebuild that which the
coalition of masculine interests had de-
Btroycd was still possible. Forty thou
sand francs would be at their disposition
by the liquidation of the security deposit
ed for the school. Qulgnonnet had noti
fied Pirnitz of this in M. Duramberty s
name. The sum appeared sufficient for a
modest school.
"If we be ignored," eald the apostle,
"we shall not be so much exposed to at
tack LÂ«t us profit from the cruel lesson.
We will rent an apartment, and you.
Frederique, 'and I, will teach the children
of the neighborhood, or, at any rate, a
Hrnall number of them. With the money
that we have we can continue in this way
for five years, -and perhaps circumstances
will have become more favorable for us
before then."
Frederique had finished by siding with
Pirnitz. She would have liked to begin at
once, to forget the reverse of yesterday
in the effort of to-day. Alas! there was
Btill an obstacle in her path, a duty to be
accomplished, a step that she must take,
one more urgent than all others It was
a difficult one to take., but. in addition to
the fact that she had promised Daisy
â¢without giving her any details, and that
Daisy reminded her constantly or her
promise. Frcderlque felt herself con
strained to it by a more imperative voice,
to which she never refused obedienceâ
the voice of her conscience, which. sala
to her, as formerly, when a child in her
little black alpaca- apron, "You ought to

Germalne, after a severe attack of per
itonitis, was at present a prisoner In the
St. Lazalre Infirmary. The legal investi

commenced after her cureâ had resulted
in a decision, according to journals usu

premeditated murder. This meant that

maine's lawyer. M. Renouard. was of the
opinion that her cause before a Jury was
compromised. The Parisian Jury, made
up of tradesmen and minor citizens, has
not much tenderness for. anarchical doc
trines. Now. by a kind of fatality, all
the papers of revolutionary tendencies
had taken up Germaine's cause and pre
sented her mad act as a sort of heroic
protestation worthy of Charlotte Corday.
On the other >hand. all the conservative
papers had united in an attack against
the prisoner. If not the head, at least the
liberty of the young girl for many years
was in danger. _' .'_'Â¦â¢'â¢
This then, was the step which Freder
ique was meditating, and this was why
she felt a repugnance for it. although she
believed it both efficacious and necessary.
Just as she had now erased Lea from
her heart, she had, while still a child,
blotted out all memory, and even tne
name, of Christine's seducer.
At the same time It had not been pos
sible for her to help hearing from time to
time about the d'Ubzac family; at any
rate. In a general way. Mme. d Lbzac had
died In 1SD7. The banker was still living,
but had retired from business. Â£ Very old.
but sturdy, he now lived in the Avenue
du Bols de Boujogne In a princely resi
dence that he had built. Henri d'Lbzac
had followed the legal profession since
the time when his autocratic father had
arranged for him to be sent as assistant
judge in South Algeria. Being remark
ably intelligent and energetic, and as
sisted as well by his great fortune and
name, he was appointed, upon leaving
Algeria, after three years of exile there.
Procureur at Mirande. then Chateauroux.
then at Lille, and at thirty years of age
had returned to Pari3 as Assistant Public
Prosecutor. About this period he had
married a Mile, de Llvron-Bastard. be
longing to the old aristocracy of the
Rhone district, but fortuneless. He had
no children. The outbreak of Boulanglsm
in 1SSS found him Public Prosecutor at
Lyons. He had ranged himself decidedly
upon the side of the republican party, a
move that had caused a quarrel with his
wife's family and had created a little
coolness with his ' father. When . order

took his place upon the Left. In 1S94 he
formed; one of the ministerial combination
and was given the portfolio of Justice.
The Ministry existed fifteen months; at
its fall the post of Chief President of the
Cour de Cassation was vacant, and the
former Minister of Justice was appointed
to it. He was then 53 years of age. Since
then he had maintained his important sit
uation both as Judge and as politician.
His reputation was that of an honest, elo
quent, learned, upright man. of rather
moody character and difficult to ap
proach. He was said to be very Influen
tial.
Frederique knew all this. She had never
seen her father, but the portrait of the
"Premier President d'Ubzac." published
in the illustrated papers had several
â¢ times attracted her gaze. lie was youth
ful and robust in appearance, notwith
standing the precocious whiteness of hi3
hair; his Vandyke beard waa going gray.
In his features, his eyes and the outline
of his forehead the young girl could trace
her own resemblance. A sentiment of
proud rebellion seized her before this por
trait, but she felt no tenderness toward
him. If she ever gave a thought to her
unworthy father it was only to confirm
her: in her resolution to maintain a
haughty aloofness with regard to him
The rupture between them was definite.
Nevertheless, she was not ignorant of
the. fact that the President had sought
information about the existence and sit
uation, in life of his daughter upon sev
eral occasions, but the very form of these
attempts irritated Frederfque instead of
disarming her. They betrayed an insult
ing circumspection. They were conducted
officially, so to speak, by, the means at
the disposition of such an' important ner
sonage in thejJudicial sphere. The rirst
one was in 1856. when M. dX'bzac wa*
nominated Chief President, and shortlv
after the departure of the two sisters 'or
London.
Â¦ Frederique only learned of it after her
return, though the concierge at the Rue
de la Sourdiere. who told her that a well
dressed gentleman, "who looked like a
superior clerk," had asked for informa-

the expulsion of the foundresses by minis

"Dear Duyvecke!"
Â¦ Frederique kissed the pretty Flemins
upon both cheeks. In the sultry mist oc
that autumn evening. In the moral dis
tress caused by another separation after
so many, she felt gladdened and com
forted by this friendly encounter â one that
she had not expected and that all at or.ee
changed for her the city's welcome.'
"I saw you a few moments ago with
Sister Odile," said Duyvecke. humbly "I
should lfave liked to bid her farewell also
but I did- not dare. You know 1 am not
very daring."
She asked Frederique for permission to
.accompany her as far aa tho Rue de la
Sourdiere. Frederique consented, Joyous

Orleans Station to the Rue du Faubour Â¦-

"Yes â I* came. Mile. Plrnlta. whom I
went to see during your absence.- told ma
that you would arrive by this train to

The appeal, therefore. wa3 decided upon.
Frederique was going to make It when
Mile, de Sainte-Paraile's death and the
Journey to Poudenatz forced her lor defer
it. The young girl, returning to. Paris,
realized that .the most painful duty now
awaited her. and that she must make
haste. In a newspaper bought at PoJctiera
during the stoppage of the train she read
that the preliminary Inquiry was over,
and that Germaine would be sent, before

The train carrying the . two travelers
back to Paris entered the station at a

hastened to send a porter for two cabs.

"You are going, straight to the Eastern
station. Sister Odile?" asked Frederique.
"Yes. My train leaves at 9:30. I believe."
"Well. I wish you from the bottom of
my heart an agreeable journey and a
pleasant retreat among your sisters."
* "I am very glad to be going to them,
paid the nun. calmly.
She drew a little prayer-book, very much
worn, from her pocket, and after having
turned over the Jeaves by the light of a
street lamp took out a little colored en
graving painted upon a translucent sheet
of gelatine. It represented Mount Cal
vary surmounted by a heart of Jesus,
from which emanated golden rays.
"Will you accept this little picture? Our
holy father blessed it three months ago.
Our mother superior sent me two. I gave
the other to mademoiselle."
"Thanks, Sister Odlle,',* said FrederiQue,
deeply touched.
"I have no symbol of my faith to give
her," she thought, "and, besides, what. Is
the use? We are separated by a gulf.
And yet I feel that there la something In
common between, her ideal and mine."
The first of the two- cabs that they had
hailed drew up to the sidewalk. The por
ter, who came with it, said he had only
been able to find that one. and went at
once In search of another. Sister Odile
slightly pressed the hand that Frederique
held out to her and said to the driver,
"The Eastern station."
She again nodded to Frederique and the
cab disappeared In the multitude of ve
hicles.
Frederique remained standing at the
edge of the sidewalk. Her heart was op
pressed. Sister Odile had not occupied
either a large or very important place In
her life or her affections, yet she was a
part of the past, and this past was for
Frederique that which the romance of th*
twentieth year is for other youn^ girls.
The melancholy of time that files impas
sive and dissipates days, and dreams
wrung her heart. "Already almost 30
years of age â and I am further from the
object that I aimed to attain than when I
was only 20."
She perceived all the ungrateful harsh
ness of real life compared to the glory of
her ideal, as a woman submissive to the
reality of a household remembers the
sweetness of her. betrothal. â¢
In her turn she placed her luggage In
the cab which drew up for her. Just as
she was puttinjr a tip In the hand of tho
porter, a voice behind her said:
"Mile. Frederique!"
She turned, and saw by the light Of a
gas lamp, in the halo of mist, a woman
with a pretty face, a Httle too stout, and
her waist visibly too large. â¢
"Duyvecke! You hore?" *?>*g8
The young woman bowed her head, and
stammered:
The apostle replied without hesitation:
"Nothing constrains you morally to do
bo. But I, who know you so well, am cer
tain of two things. The first is, that you
do not risk the least particle of your dig
nity in going to see M. tl'L'zbac: for this
time it is not about the material inter
ests of the school, but about a question
of humanity and justice. And I know,
also, that if you abstain from doing it
you will suffer cruel regret the day. Ger
maine's condemnation la pronounced."
"Oh, Romalne! I pray you, help me to
decide what is my duty. Ought I to go
and see ray father?**
"Perhaps," Frederique could not help
thinking, "I might have done something
to prevent these catastrophes."- Â¦ . â¢
When the papers announced the gloomy
aspect of Germaine's affair. Frederidue.
impelled by her conscience, consulted Pir
nitz again. .
Feeling this sentiment of scornful con
tempt, nothing less than the rude shocks
suffered for some months had been neces
sary to bring Frederique to consider the
idea of a direct appeal, to her fatherâ tho
expulsion of the toundresses from- the
school. Germaine about to be tried In thÂ»
Assize Court.
Instead of that, she divined the waver
ing desire of a man. possessing all the
gifts of fortune but without legitimate
children, weary of his fortune and seeking
in a long forgotten paternity new pleas
ures and emotions. But. even while seek
ing them, he tried to conciliate them with
the necessities of hi3 rank, would risk
nothing, compromise nothing.
"Ah! he has not changed?. He Is still
the same egoist who ruined the home of a
poor old professor and of a young Inno
cent working girl. He Is the worthy son
of the. banker who believed he paid for
tha honor of my mother with forty thou
sand francs and a husband with a tarn
ished reputation." - ' :.~>
The only measure' that she would have
excused would have been a loyal, personal
visit from President d'L'bzac. Her mind
was too just not to admit and approve
the persistence or even the taray awaken
ing of remorse in the man's heart, and if
this remorse had been expressed to her,
face to face, she would have offered her
hand to her father, would have said to
him. /'I forgive you, but do not offer me
either money or protection. 1 will havo
neither!" Â¦ .
The last mark of interest manifested to
ward Frederique was a letter recently
written to Mile, Heurteau by the same
secretary. M. d'Ubzac's name- was not
mentioned this time, but the writer, bas
ing his offer upon the acquaintance made
the day. of the inauguration, reassured
the mistresses about the probable conse
quences of the Bartlett affair, except so
far as Germaine Soubize herself was con
cerned. All these tentatlves at reconcilia
tion produced exactly the opposite of tha
object which they were intended to at
tain. They irritated Frederique against
him who inspired them". \
"I ask nothing from him: why does he
interfere in my affairs? And if he wishes
to have anything to do with. them, why
all this hypocrisy and caution? Let him
come out boldly and show himself: Is he
afraid of me? Is he afraid of blackmail?"
tion about her. The questioner claimed
to have known Christine Surier and her
grandfather. I>Kay, and gave himself out
as an old friend of the family. Now, tho
Legay-Surier family had no friend an
swering to his description, and Freder
ique, who had learned through the- papers
of her father's promotion, felt intuitively
that It was he who was making inquiries
about her. The second overture was made
several days before the inauguration of
the School of Arts for Women. The press
had cited tho name of Frederique Legay-
Surier among those of the foundresses.
The private secretary of the Senator-
President came to see Mile. Heurteau. thÂ»
official directress, and. without stating
that he came directly from M. d'Ubzac,
ne very adroitly mentioned his name,
said that the enterprise seemed to htm
worthy of attention and sympathy, and
that, if necessary, he should be disposed
to Interest the ruling powers in it. Fred
erique. arranged that nothing should coma
of these propositions. She. with Lea and
Pirnitz, divined the secret meaning of.
them, a meaning that Mile. Heurteau.
and possibly even the secretary, ignored.
And the prudence of M. d'Lbzac's In
quiries again wounded the young girl's
feelings. â¢ Â¦
Frederique thought: "That nun's lips
make the same movement as those of Lea,
who is In love; the movement that signi
fies admiration. That is to say, she gives
to her supernatural lover all that ordinary
women offer to their lovers of flesh and
blood; and by that means, being satisfied
and content, she escapes from the law of
servitude that binds our sex. Yes. every
thing demonstrates that the secret of the
Sister Odile awoke when they were near
St. Pierre-des-Corps. The train slackened
its speed and whistled as it passed the
signal. , She awoke without changing her
position, calm und peaceful, as tnougn
sue had never slept, as though. she had
simply closed. her eyes for some time to
pray with - greater devotion. Her gaze
met that. of Frederique and she smiled.
"We are approaching Paris?" she asked.
"Oh; no: we are not yet at Tours, re
plied Frederique. '- T-
"Where do we take tea?' ... , ..
"At Aubrals. I believe, about 4 o clock.
During the; journey Frederique had no
ticed the importance attached by the nun
to her meals. Sister Odile had a keen ap
petite and drank her wine almost unai
luted. At Salnte-Parade's nephew s house
she had even asked for black coffee and
had complained that it was badly made.
She disconcerted her companion by this
mixture of selfishness and altruism, reli
gious stoicism and vulgar attention to ner
comfort. . .
Informed about the hour for the meal,
the nun took up her rosary and began to
recite prayer after prayer. The big blacK
beads, strung on a brass chain, sped along
under her short, dimpled fingers; her lips
moved as she repeated the prayers, or
which only the hissing of the letter s
could be heard. From time to time, at in
tervals regulated by a mysteriou3 devo
tional ritual, she touched the little brass
image of Christ, polished by twenty years
of pious caresses, which was hanging at
the end of the chain, and kissed It.

Ufa near the poor deceased Invalid. Bis
ter OcuiÂ©, who had assisted at the flrÂ»Â«
steps of the work, who had received Mile,
de Salnte-Parade's confidences, had never
asked Frederique for any news or tne
school, had never inquired about the mis
tress whom she no longer sawâ about Lea.
And this discretion, although Frederique
preterred it. had pained her, it bore sucn
a resemblance to indifference.
"What sort of a soul is hidden undÂ« r
that -violet gown and. under that wjute
veil? What does she love? What does
she hope for? Is she really so free from
all human passion that nothing touches
her. that nothing interests her?"
She decided to question her before they
separated for all time, to discover the se
cret of that strange souk

her for her mission; nothing, not even suf
fering, for she haU loved a man. and she
had confirmed herself in her hidden sor
row. With what joy she had consum
mated the sacrifice of her love! How she
had cherished her renunciation, her self
devotion to a life void of all joy other
than attachment to her ideal!
To-day, on the eve of becoming more
than a young woman â she had Just en
tered her twenty-sixth yearâ she was wit-"
ncsslng the destruction of all that had
been realized for a moment â¢ among all
her dreams. The 'Work was practically
abolished. The School of Arts for Women
would reopen In the Rile ,des Vergers at
the next scholastic year, under the direc
tion of Mile. Herteau. but It would be an
enslaved school, accepting tho "Compact
of St. Charles." with" tfce Abbe MInot as
moral guide, and the political success of
Jude Duramberty, the protector of the
school,- as object," Instead of feminine
emancipation. So much unselfish effort,
so much trouble; had brought about this
ironical result; the election of a selfish
manufacturer as a Deputy, who should
be half clerical, half socialist.' And the
bitterest feature of all. was that' the sa
cred battalion had been, shattered with
defeat. Frederique had believed It bo
strong, so Infrangible, that grmip of young
women united for the emancipation* of
their sex! Alas! now she could count the
vacant places In : the ranks." There re
mained around Pirnitz not even the little
troop cf Gideon, the troop that lifted up
Its head after drinking of; the water of
the torrent. Duyvecke had been. the llrst
to leave, drawn from altruistic duty, by. a
desire for a more banal tenderness; then
Germaine, excited. by horrible hereditary
influences, had committed a deed of mad
ness,, which had been the death of the
school. Mile, de Salnte-Parade being dead.
Sister Odile was going back to her. con
vent probably completely indifferent to
the grand deeds that had been accom
plished around her. Â¦ Mile. Heurteau had
betrayed them through vile personal "am
bition. Daisy Craggs would probably de
vote the .remainder .of -her life - and
strength to Germaine.' And ", only - Fred
erique remained standing by Pirnitz's
Bide!
xhere was one name, among those of
the apostles who formerly used to. sit
around the council table in the Sainte-Pa
rade residence, thai Frederique would not
utter when she counted the absentees and
the deserters. It was the name of Lea.
To have seen her betray them and .leave
them in her turn had been' too heavy a
blow for the elder. * She had erased - her
name, had extirpated all' memory of her,
like a father who forgets and disowns a
dishonored daugnter.
Oh I that laconic letter.- 60 cold, bo
household cares and maternity; Germaine
became a criminal through the:inner agi
tation of perverted sex, and Lea, brought
up to uebpise arid acorn manâ Lea. so
perfectly pure that Frederique and Plr
nitz haa envied ner purity, had been cap
tivated, transformed, by a single kiss
placed upon her lips -by a man. Oh! the
transformation had been slow, it is true,
but Lea had let herself be conquered, and
the conquest had endured in spite of ab
sence. Like those mysterious leprosies
that destroy the fields, masculine Influ
ence had insensibly destroyed the healthy,
vivifying germs formerly planted in her
young soul. Then - one day the change
was complete; another Lea was born.
For a long time this new Lea was hid
den under the exterior of the old one, but
tho silent premeditation disclosed in her
flight; her letter of farewell, so cold and
precise, revealed a new soul, totally dil
ferent from the one Frederique' had
known. What did this coldness resemble?
What family likeness was suggested by
the selfishness of her preparations? There
was a name in Frederlque's thoughtâ the
name of the man who had oppressed her
childhoodâ the name of Lea s ; father,
Constant Surier. He was taking his ven
geance now, and mournful Christine also
reappeared .to- her -youngest Â¦ daughter,
hastening to the masculine yoke, as to
freedom. , .Â¦'." . f'<* . . .

.sides Frederique : herself, there was Pir
nitz and Daisy, over whom man had not
prevailed. But'Plrnitz was a Slav; Daisy
had Anglo-Saxon ,i blood in 'her. Celtic
veins. The one and the other belonged
to races in which , the: idea of feminino
emancipation had ' penetrated for, several
generations* and' In .which; social customs
are already; habituated . to this freedom.
How many, years will be necessary in our
old Latin society and how much effort to
emancipate the ; poor serf stooping under
the yoke of the master of countless cen
turies and returning to him always, spite
of emancipatresses? How many troops
would be decimatedâ like the little troop
raised by Romalne Pirnitzâ before the
victorious assault- that should place
woman in the heart of the social, citadel?
"No '; matter,"'- > thought â¢ Frederique.
"Each declinated troop brings the day of
victory nearer. ' And If Daisy; leave us : I
shall. remain bv Pirnltz's side.- The apos
tle's efforts will not have been entirely in
vain." ; Â¦;. Â¦/ Â¦'Â¦-'. :-
While she meditated in this way the
young girl's glance was fixed unconscious
ly upon Sfster Odile, who was still sleep-v
lne. erect, , against the back of the car
riage, her rosary swinging - between her
knees. . Sister Odile â she, v also, had for
merly sat . around-- the council table with
kind hearted' Sainte-Parade' s general
staff, and without having given m- her
heart to Pirnitz's Instruction Bhe: still re

Is in the deflection of their loving instinct.
The anecdotes of Saint Teresa and Saint
Marie Alacoque testify to this. They love
an Invisible Man, who was the handsomest
of all the children of men. Oh! is all this
blind faith necessary, then, lor us to be
free? Is It Indispensable that we should
wear away the outlines of an Image of
brasc or stone with our lips?
Frederlque's Â¦ pride protested against
such an idea, but, although incapable of
Imitating her, she nevertheless envied the
young woman In her violet sackcloth go
ing over the praises of an invisible Lover.
They took tea at the buffet at Aubrals,
Frederique without appetite. Sister Odile
copiously. As they returned to the train
the. nun regretted that they had so little
time to eat. / She appeared to be In a. good
humor and more loquacious than usual.
Frederique had noticed that she took a
sort of recreation after her, meals, perhaps
conformedly with the customs of her con-,
vent. The Sister began to talk freely
about the long Journey she had still to
make before, attaining her harbor, the Al
satlan convent, of which the mere name,
St. Mary, brought a gleam of joy into her
expressionless face each time she ut
tered It.
"You have never been to Thann?" she
asked Frederique.
"No. Sister Odile."
"Ah! It is a. beautiful countryâ much
more beautiful than all this," she said
pointing disdainfully to the plains of
Beauce stretching along each side of the
railway. "And St. Mary's Convent Is as
big as a palace. It Is a Gothic building
The chapel alone can contain 1500 people',
like a city church â â "
"Are you glad to return there?." asked
Frederique. ,--.â¢Â¦
"Yes, very glad. Just think, it will Boon
be four yearsâ yes, four yearsâ since I left
it. While I have been in Paris nursing
Mile, de Sainte-Paradc, God has called to
him our Mother Superior. 1 have never
seen the present Superior." j
"Shall you remain at the convent now?"
"I don f t:know. The rule is that when
our invalids no. longer. need us we return
to to which we belongand
make a retreat there. After that the Su
perior, sends us, where she chooses. But
the retreat is perfect happiness."
Â¦ :>he pressed her crucifix to her bosom
with her hands. Frederique realized that

Napoleon Used Bran and
Lemon Instead of Soap.
British critice of the Boers are fond of
asserting -that the sturdy Transvaalers
use liftle soap. Â¦
Tliis may: be true or not. Even if true,
there is plenty of precedent. The Japan
ese, the most cleanly people in the world,
rarely use soap. .. The Russians use vapor
baths for cleanliness' sake. Rough inside
clothing cleanses the skin. There are
doctors who have cured skin diseases by
insisting upon their delicate patients
abandoning silk underwear and- using
very coarse stuff Instead.
Napoleon, whose hands were good to
model and. beautifully white, used bran
and lemon juice and no soap, unless to
shave. â¢ v â¢ . '

and smut, soap is more needed/ than In

Woman Responsible for the
Loss of Many Battles.
Many as thft cases are of battles won
through the agency of women, of the type
of Bcadicca and Joan of Arc, there can be
no denying the fact that equally numer
ous, If not more so, are those of. victories
spoiled by the fair eex and of battles lost
owing to feminine machinations.
There are many, says Tit-Bits, who as
sert that failure of the Jamoson raid at
the outset was brought about by
women. President Kruger is in the habit
of employing^ countless detectives, both
male and female, in the Transvaal as well
as abroad. The barmaids of Johannes
burg, for example, were said to be in the
pay of Oom Paul. These ladies, by means
of their propensities for extracting confi
dences, are alleged to have wrung from
Eome of the raiders long before the raid
itself was entered upon the fact that it
was forthcoming. The consequence was
that when It came about Cronje was fully
prepared.
France can point to a number of cases
In .which victories connected with the re
public have been spoiled by, women, and
the whole course of events changed In
consequence. For example, the fall of
General Boulanger was brought about by
a member of the fair sex. But for the
Vicomtesse de Honnemain there is the
chance that ho might have become the
ruler of France. " The lady induced him 1 to
pay her a visit on the night of his election
as a member of the Chamber of Deputies,
v/hen, , had he refrained ; from so doing!
end instead marched upon the Elysee, as
his partisans begged him'' to do, the his
tory of the republic might have been en
tirely altered.

of Hannibal, whose wife was the uninten
tional cause of his fall and the failure of
his 'once successful; armies. The great
general was so foolish" ns to marry .when
he should have beendevoting all his time

Some Points Concerning the Wearing of Gloves
Also the Right and Wrong Way to Put Them On
mjST women do not realize the
importance of the glove. An 111
fittir.g or inappropriate glove can
mar the effect of an entire cos
tame. It is unfortunate that there
ehould be so much carelessness in con
nection with that .ir:ic!c of dress which
has held so revered a piace in romantic
history. Gloves have been the symbol of
power, the gage of defiance and the to
ken of love, and now they have dwin
dled to a necessary adjunct of dress
which 5n the majority of cases is treated
with the Htne consideration as a poor
relationâ anything is good enough! But
women's carelessness of detail in regard
to hand covering is noticed and com
mented upon to an <?xtcnt which, if the
fair woarors only realized it. would cre
ate a revolution in glove wearing.
There are many "do'nots" which are
applicable to glove wearing:
Do i;ot tuy cheap gloves. If your ln-
glove he sure the fingers are long enough
and that the button or clasp fastens at the
juncture of wrist and hand and not on the
palm. It is best to purchase from differ
ent dealers until gloves perfectly suiting
the hand of the wearer are discovered,
and then give that 'dealer all your trade.
Promiscuous glove buying is as bad as
promiscuous shoe buying.
On the other hand, do not wear gloves
too large. The baggy backs, wrinkled
fingers and slouchy wrists do not give
that refinement of appearance which all
women covet.
Do not wear a glove with a button off or
a rip in some seam, thinking it will not
be noticed. Such a defect Is glaring to
strangers and friends. Almost any store
will have any gloves which have been
bousrht from them properly mended for a
trifling sum. and the gloves look much
better than when mended at home.
Do not put a new glove on carelessly.

<V FAVORTfE AUTHORESS
TSUUS OF HER
AS A WRITER
her home in Brooklyn, where she at once
set about the collection and revision of
her verses. Having accomplished that
task she tried to find a publisher, but
failed. Then the suggestion that she turn
from poetry; to fiction was renewed. Â¦â¢
Remembering that' in a previous effort
she had failed to please herself, the young
writer- hesitated a lon^.tinys before tak
ing tho offered advice. At last, however,
. she concluded to make the attempt, and
from that time till a date quite two years
later she lived in a little world of her
own. She had .the plot all mapped out
before she began, but it had to be changed
and modified as the work progressed, and
much of the writing had to be done over
and over ngain. Thus chapter after chap
ter was recast and rewritten, and on sev
eral occasions she felt sorely tempted to
burn the manuscript and forget It. It
was not until | the story was two-thirds
written that she dared say anything
about it to any one.
Then she showed the copy to her father,
who read it, saw that she had struck a
vein, and encouraged her to finish the
tale, albeit he suggested many modifi
cations. \ These the daughter accepted
without question, for her father was a
lawyer, and his suggestions were all
along the line of practicality, logical de
velopment and conformity to the legal
technicalities. in the part3 which had to
do with the courts.
"I felt grateful to my father for his
kindness in helping me," says Mrs. Rohlfa
when talking of the circumstances now,
"but I must confess that the way he tore
some of my most cherished construction
all to pieces was almost disheartening.
However, I reconstructed and pieced to
gether the parts which he had condemned,
and set about completing my work. I had
already written about 100,000 words, and
the story seemed to me not more than
half developed, but as my father warned
me against .making it too long I com
pressed the remainder, and when at last
the manuscript was completed the story
exceeded 130,000 words by only a few hun
dred. S
-"I was. then eager to take the copy to a
publisher, but my father suggested that it
ought to berevised again, and by a judge.
So to a judge of our, acquaintance the
copy was taken, and he waded .through
it most patiently. I say this advisedly,
for, as it then stood, the manuscript of
'The Leavenworth Case' was the strang
est looking mass of paper you- ever saw.
You sec. 1 had written part of it at home
In Brooklyn, part of It at the seashore,
part of it in the mountains and other
parts wherever I had chanced to be as a
guest, on Journeys and so on. I had pro
cured my paper and ink from the nearest
dealer in every case, without a thought of
uniformity. Chromatically the copy was
more like Joseph's coat of many colors
than anything else I can compare it to,
for some of the paper was white, some.,
blue, 'some pink and some buff. But the
Judge made^ no comments on the motley
appearance of the manuscript and was
very encouraging in his. report on the
work as a whole. It had held his interest
from first -to -last, he said, and the only
technical criticism that he could offer was
on my use In one place of the word
'equity.' So far as the word's ordinary
meaning was concerned I had used It
properly, but it had a significance in legal
parlance which I had failed to grasp.
"Wall, I fixed up the word 'equity' and
took the much scarred manuscript to the.
head of a well-known publishing house.
He didn't mind the appearance of the copy
âthough I'll confess I'd hesitate to offer
&uch manuscript to any one nowadaysâ
and had it read. He warned me, though,
that 150,000 words was altogether too long,
and. further, that he wasn't very hopeful
that a story of the sort I had described
to him, particularly If written by a
young woman, would please the public
at all. i^Cv
"The reports of the readers were fa
vorable In the main, but the publisher
would not regard them as conclusive.
'Now.' he said, 'you cut out 50,000 words
and then get Rosslter Johnson to read It.
If he reports favorably we'll Lring out
your book.* It had been hard enough to
write the story In the first place, but It
was harder still -to cut out one-third of
what had cost me so much time and ef
fort, but I shut my eyes, so to speak, and
after several days of hard work the ex
cisions were performed.
"Mr. Johnson, as it chanced, was a
friend of our family, and, though a very
busy man, he was willing to pass on the
story. He came to our house in Brook
lyn for that purpose, and in view of the
condition of the copy I volunteered to
read it to him. So he settled himself
comfortably in his chair and I began. He
said that if It were very bad I needn't
read it all, and, though he Bald it mow,
as a joke than anything else, this filled
me with a terror that can be more easily
understood than described. After I had
read two or three chapters I noticed with
alarm that his eyes were closed, and,
thinking- that possibly he might have
fallen asleep through sheer lack of in
terest, I stopped. There was a pause of
opening his eyes, he eaid the one word,
'Morel' So I went on till midnight or
later, when the reading was suspended
till next day. After it was all read Mr.
Johnson wa? good enough to give, the
story his approval. In due time the book
came out, and that is how I made my
start as a story writer."
All the manuscript Mrs. Rohlfs writes
now !s read aloud, as was that of "The
Leavenworth Case," but the author is
rarely the reader. When she is producing
a story she devotes the major part of tho
day to the work, writing rapidly for sev
eral hours, after which she devotes some
time to correction. In the evening, when
the lamps havebeen lighted, she and her
husband and the governess of their chil

author herself, and she is constantly mak

as the reading progresses. At the same
time she plans the work of the coming

over the finished copy and crosses the t's

A Few Recipes for Making Glace
Fruits, Candies and Other Confections
No box of assorted candies is complete
Â¦without some glaced fruits. For this, the
syrup should be handled differently. Take
the same proportion of sugar and water,
but boil the liquid until it comes to the
crackling point. Test it by dropping a
little Into cold water. If it is brittle when
cobled it Is ready for the fruit. Take the
.kettle from the hot part of the stove, but
set it where it will keep warm. Dip can
dled cherries, grapes or Brazil nuts, or
whatever nut or fruit you may fancy, into
the syrup and then put them on waxed
paper to dry; when quite hard, dip them Â¦
a second time. One of the most success
ful home-made qandies is the opera cara
mel, that somehow, takes on a profes- :
sional air. however it may be handled.
Take three cups of granulated sugar and
add to it a cup of cream and a little less
than a saltspoonful of cream of tartar.
Boil this in a double boiler, and as it lias.
no tendency to grain it may be stirred
during the process. Boil until, it may be
easily molded into a soft ball. Then fla
vor with vanilla or chocolate and stir in
chopped assorted nuts; when it gets suf
ficiently cool roll out and cut into cara
mels.
A most delicious confection that Is rare
ly seen is made as follows: Take the
orange rinds that are left over from
breakfast, cut them into strips, removing
carefully- the bitter white pith from the
inside: Put them into crater and boil un
til they are quite tender. Now make a
syrup by putting four Â¦ tablespoonfuls of
water to a "cup of sugar. -Place this over
the flre and bring to the' crackling point,
then put in the orange strips and cook foi
five minutes. Remove from the stove and
leave the rinds in the syrup until it coola;
then drain on sieve and roll in granulated
susar. Placed in a dainty box lined with
silk paper this dainty confection is most
acceptable. _ :
Delicious "maple creams: Take a quart
of maple syrup made from pure maple
sugar. Cook the syrup until a little drop

but they bore the same resemblance to
those turned out by the navy yards that
a. contract-built house does to one con

No boats have been built for the navy
BincolSSS, chififiy because of the inability
of the outside boat builders to properly
understand what la expected. For tha
purpose of, minutely Illustrating and ex
plaining the high standard of design and
construction required by the navy for ita
small boats 'there 'has been printed undet
my, direction by the Government Printing
'Office at Washington a volume of "Stand

detailed- working plan -for every part of
every boat from the 40-foot steam cutter,
which Is. a small man-of-war in: Itself,
down to the. 10-foot punt, which Is . in ap
pearance .almost as . simple as a horse
trough. "\
Yet all are designed with the same, care
and the American sailor can feel that no
matter what bont he is in that it is tho'
best of .its class that floats. \This book
with Its plans, specifications and ' details
of the 'thirty, types of boats comprising
the. "little" navy" explains In Its 222 plates
and 8G: pages of text and tables all that
is required of navy boats, Â¦ and while ' It la
not intended by. the navy to contract:for
-boats â¢ in" time Â¦ of . peace, occasion ; may
arise when navy yards may be unable to
supply bouts at short notice. .

has, to do is to -consult ; this book and fol

finding, out needed changes, each boat is

ranging from 40 ; to 23 feet in length, with
speeds ' varying from, nine; knots down to

This, perhaps. Is the most truthful de
scription of the British policy, or rather,
lack of it In the Far' East,' ever given to
the public. The feeling among the offi
cials is that- Russia's Inroads on: Japan's
prerogatives in Korea constitute a much
graver source of danger than the "Box
ers' " outbreaks, though^ Korean matters
have* temporarily ceased to figure promi

Claude McDonald, our Minister," said one
of the officials responsible for the con
duct of these affairs. "He is empowered
to requisition the gims and men he needs
from the China squadron. All the Min

moniously. We know practically nothing
of the local conditions existing there, and
never heard of the 'Boxers' until the
other day. I am inclined to believe .we
shall not hear of them again in the near
future. /
"Yes. perhaps the Chinese policy Is
Lord Salisbury's weakest point. But as
a matter of fact England cannot have
any Far East policy. .The constant change
of government leaves nothing for the
Foreign Minister to do but become an
opportunist of the extreme type. 'AVith
Russia it. is different . She is an auto
cratic power, whose Foreign Office re
mains in power as long a3 it pleases the
Czar. During the lifetime of a ruler a
consistent policy can thus be carr^d out.
In England we have no such chance."

latest outbreak will result in * anything

the question of the partition of China is
a possibility at present considered too

POINTED TALK BY
THE PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
On a recent dash into Lady-brand, an Orange Free State town, the, British captured the " Landvost
and a field cornet. Compelled by the appearance of a body of Boers on the outskirts of the town to re
tire hastily, they placed the two captives in a cart with a native driver, and with a trooper riding at each
side with a drawn pistol, carried them out of tie place at a gallop to safe custody.
PRETORIA. May 31 (delayed in trans
mission).âJohannesburg was formally
handed over to the British at 11 o'clock
this morning in an orderly manner. Lord
Roberts was accompanied by a small
force. The banks are guarded. There was
a flight engagement outside Jphannesburg
and some Australian scouts were shot In
street fighting. After this a message was
sent to the .nearest British general notify

entry into Pretoria will not be long de

completely broken and the war practically
is over, although the complete occupation
of the country will take some time -and
probably will be delayed by many suer
rilla bands.
LONDON. June 3.â Spenser Wilkin
. son. reviewing the events . of the
week in South Africa for the Asso
ciated Press, says: "The situation
can clearly be understood if we In
the first instance neglect the Pretoria tel
egrams. Lord i Roberts advanced over the
Vaal in two columns, he himself with the
main body, following the line of railway,
and Generals French and Hamilton keep
ing with him a short march to the left
and slightly In advance- On Monday
night General Roberts was at Klip River
station, the left wing cojumi^ being south
of Klipriversberg. The Boers retreated
before General Roberts, but resisted the
left wing. On Tuesday night General
Roberts was at Germlston and the left
wing near Florida, Just west of Johannes
burg.' . i
"On Wednesday morning General Rob
erts arrived at Johannesburg and agreed
to give twenty-four hours', delay before
entering the town, which, however, he
surrounded with troops. Generals French
and Hamilton were kept away from the
town and pushed forward.
"On Thursday General Roberts entered
Johannesburg, and made a formal occupa
tion. He held a review of two divisions
and then, leaving a brigade to garrison
the town, he put his main body into camp
to the north on the Pretoria road on Fri
day morning. At that time French and
Hamilton were well forward toward Pre
toria. Very likely General French was
east of the railway and the remainder of
the army within two easy marches of the
capital.
"Meantime Lord Roberts' communica
tions were well covered and the Free
State forces were receiving punishment.

Free Staters near Senekal and received
reinforcements from the Third Brigade.

President Kruger left. The Boer troops
were dismissed frcm the fort3 at Pretoria
and the town resolved to surrender and
made its arrangements. The burghers

DETAILS OF THE RECENT
TAKING OF JOHANNESBURG
LONDON. June 3.-Prctoria is still
unoccupied by the British army, to
judge from Lord Roberts' failure
to report the eagerly awaited event,
and England is beginning to won
der jf after his successful entry into the
Transvaal a new campaign must be
planned and the enemy be followed into
the Lydenburg fastnesses, whither they
are apparently going with their heavy
guns to Join President Kxuger.
Evidence that the Boers have not given
up the struggle is afforded in plenty by
the recent trapping 1 of Brabant's patrols,
sharp fighting near Senekal. in Which thÂ©
British, it is now known, had thirty-two
killed and 150 wounded, and the fierce at
tack on Warren at Douglas, in Cape Col
ony. These events in widely scattered
sections of the field of war point plainly
to long-continued guerrilla warfare unless
the mala body, of the enemy is speedily
crushed or captured. '/. Â¦..
The exact situation as to Pretoria is a
mystery. According- to press dispatches
from there Thursday, the British patrols
were around the town and the citizens*
committee was maintaining order. In a
dispatch dated at Johannesburg late Fri
day night Lord Roberts says not a word
about the Boer capital and tells vag-uely
about French having taken up a position
r.orth of Johannesburg, to which he had
been ordered.
Wide speculation is possible as to the
extent and meaning of the Important op
erations which Lord Roberts doubtless has
In progress. The seeming delay in the
British commander's dispatches has given
rise to a theory that his communications
to the southward are being tampered with
by marauding bands of the enemy, but
this has few adherents. y
It is generally believed that the British
forces are cautiously advancing on Pre
toria, talcing- every military precaution
Â¦which they would were the enensy iiwwn
to be !n great strength on their tronU. In \
this Lcrd Roberts would be following the
dictates of his soldierly nature, not mak
ing a dash until the armed foe were out
of the capital.

SUIT AGAINST DR. SEIFEBT.
Dr. Fowler Accuses Him of Passing
Over Worthless Stock.
Special Dispatch to The Call. '
SAN JOSE, June" 2.â A suit was filed in
the Superior Court to-day by Dr. G. W.
Fowler of Santa Clara against Dr. George
W. Seifert of this city, whom he charges
with scheming and defrauding him. of" a
note for $2000. The defunct -Union Savings
Bank is a side issue in the action, and 150
shares of that institution's stock 'is what
caused the estrangement between the
medicos. The complaint states that
on June ' 15, 1S99, Dr. Seifert was
the owner of that amount of bank
stock, -"and ! that on representations
of his going awaj he Induced Dr.
Fowler to allow him to put the stock in
his name; at the same time, to secure
himself, he received oÂ£ Dr. Fowler the
$2000 note.
The Santa Clara doctor says he had al
ways looked upon Dr. Seifert as a friend,
and at the time thought he was aiding
him, but he is now convinced Dr. Seifert
was scheming to save himself from .re
sponsibility as a stockholder of the Union
Savings Bank. He states the bank was In
dire financial distress at the time, and that
Dr. Seifert had learned that fact from
President H. W. Wright. There is now a
$50 per share assessment due on the stock,
in all $10,500, and he declares Seifert trans
ferred-the stock to him to escape this.
Fowler wants his holding of stock de
clared in trust for Dr. Seifert. the return
of his $2000 note and the Union Savings
Bank enjoined from collecting the 110,500
assessment due on stock from him.

PARIS, June 2.â The funeral service at
the Church Madeleine to-day of Maitre
Falateuf, M. Deroulede's counsel before
the High Court, was made the occasion of
a noisy demonstration by a body of Na
tionalists. After the funeral- services
Francois Copee, who represented M. De
roulede, insisted on delivering a political
speech under the j?orch of s the church.
He denounced the High Court (Senate),
amid shouts of approval from thirty Na
tionalists, including MM. Harrlllier, Gas
ton, Mery and a number of other leading
Municipal Councilors. M. Copee drove
away in a oab, brandishing his hat in the
air, his supporters crying, "Vive .Copee:"
"Vive Deroulede!" f
The crowd present looked on wondering
ly and in dead silence, but a workman
responded with cries of "Vive Loubet!"
"Vive la republique!" whereupon the par
tisans of the Nationalists ; rushed upon
the manifestant, beating him over the
head with sticks and fists. In an instant
the man's face was covered with blood
and he was with great difficulty' rescued

NATIONALISTS BECOME
RIOTOUS AT A FUNERAL
Gcpyripfct^a, l?0P. by the Associated Press.
LONDON. June ".âWhen England is
not talking of peace In South Africa and
the mariner of its accomplishment the
topic of the day is the dissolution of Par
liament' and the possible retirement of
Lord Salisbury. . Sir Howard Vincent
writes to. the Times, declaring that the
Premier's withdrawal from the field of
activity' would be nothing less than, a
calamity; lor the universe.
The Spectator surmises that Lord Salis
bury will give !up the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, contenting himself with being
Premier only, and suggests that Mr. Bal
four should be given his uncle's portfolio
and be made a PeÂ«r, while Mr. Chamber
lain should succeed, the Marquis of Lans
downe as Secretary of State for War and
become Government leader in the House
of Commons, these hypothetical changes
to come after the dissolution, which, the
Spectator announces, should occur this
year, and insists must be followed by a
thorough reconstruction of the Cabinet.
Other weeklies and dailies also refer to
the possibility of Lord Salisbury's retire
ment.
â¢ Inquiries made by the Associated Press
reveal the fact that there is not the
slightest ground for believing that Lord
Salisbury contemplates retiring, cither
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or
the leadership of the party. He has never
mentioned such a contingency, and his
spirits are equally good, even to the point
of what for him is unusual jocularity,
while his Interest in home and foreign
affairs is keener than ever. So it is. safe
to say that if the Conservatives are suc
cessful at the forthcoming general elec
tion Lord Salisbury will once more pilot
ihr fortunes of the country and the party.
The Outlook keenly diagnosed the Pre
mier's recent remarkable speeches, where
by h*Â» has gained the reputation of think
ing aloud, when It describes him as "look
ing with a half-amused, half-pitiful gaze
on the hurly-burly."
His utterances this week were saved
from being a mere collection of platitudes
by the frank. declaration that "not a shred
of independence" could be left to the Boer
republics. This was Intended to be taken
as an answer to any peace-seeking mes
sages that President Kruger might be
contemplating.
The decision anent the date of_dissolu
tlon is still In. the air. Mr. Chamberlain
favors an eapy appeal to the country, but
Ix>rd Salisbury will not formally discuss
the, matter until Cord Roberts so shapes
the military aspect of South Africa that
thfre cannot be a Fhadcw of a doubt as to
the completeness of the British victory.
Encouraged by the remarkable success
of amateur charitable performances of
lhe past winter London society women,
wearied of other forms of excitement
propose to appear on a music hall stage,
which will net. only afford themselves en
tertainment, but will give the public a
chance to view the fashionable gowns
which are ordinarily restricted to Ascot
or the Sunday park parade. The idea had
its inception with a Mayfair modiste anx
ious to display costumes of her making,
hne met with a hearty response from her
fasfcionabie customers.

RETIREMENT
OF SALISBURY
NOT EXPECTED
Copyrighted, : 19C0, by the Associated Press,
PARIS, June 2.â The republication here
of articles which have appeared in the
American press, 1 directed against Commis
sioner General Peck's management, and
charging the misuse of authority by his
staff, has started a fund of gossip, but
has resulted in" v n6 tangible evidence that
the charges arel,true. While some are v at
variance with Mr. Peck's idea, no one in
sinuates that he is involved in anjKact
not' lit- accordance with absolute honesty
or that he is actuated by any but the best
motives in directing the work of the com-;
mission. ' He asserts emphatically that no'
space! has been sold 'by employes and s ex
presses a willingness that the fullest in
vestigation be made. There are those who
privately make charges varying in de
gree, but inquiry Into the cages develops
either; lack of acquaintance with all the
facts or .a refusal to permit the public use
of the nameof/the accuser in support of
the charges. ; '
.That there Is. considerable friction and
discontent among those - connected with
the. commission and among pome of the
exhibitors" is beyond doubt. Washington
is kept posted on affairs, and, on the best
authority, the Associated Press is In
formfed that the Government has request
ed to be furnished with a list of employes,'
their salaries and occupation, from where
they were appointed and by -whom they
were recommended.-^
Peck Will Not Resign.
Mr. Peck, however, denies having re
ceived any^such" message. The pay roll is
being decreased each week as the various
experts and employes complete their work,
and : the official force will soon be much
smaller. "Friends of Mr. Peck state thai
his health Is the best and that the nervous
condition' which visitors attribute to worry
Is an affliction from which he has suffered
for years. There is certainly not the
slightest foundation for the statement
that he Intends to resign his portion on
account of ill- health.
The exposition itself drags along toward
completion, with many exhibits still' un
finished." The chief complaint of visitors
is not of lack of sufficient to see, but of
the absence of any form of amusement
except that of viewing the exhibits. There
is no outside music or any of the ottaer
attractions â¢ which . made the Chicago
World's Fair each night a scene of gayety
and brilliance. *
After a most anxious time the Chamber
of Deputies and Premier Waldeck-Rous
seau have succeeded In navigating the
ministerial bark through the breakers
thrown up by the interpellations of the
Nationalists and dissident Republicans
into the calmer waters of domestic legis
lation. . Â¦
Nationalist Moderation.
During the passage, ' however, the .Pre
mier lost one of his strongest lieutenants,
General Marquis de Gallifet, ; but the ap
parent facility with which ho Jound an
other War j Minister,- General Andre, to
fill the- breach, haa caused surprise and
raised doubts as to whether the Cabinet
is really seriously. weakened by the resig
nation. General.de Gallifet is the seventh
War Minister who has left his post on ac
count of the Dreyfue. affair. -
As presaged by the speeches of ; the
Nationalists and the comments of their
organs, the triumphant invasion of the
Municipal Council by their candidates
brought with it a sense of responsibility
with which the party is now invested, as
far as the government" of Paris is con
cerned. The Council reassembled quietly,
without a flourish of trumpets or a sign of
tempestuous weather. The newly elected
Nationalist president, in his Inauguration
speech, held to most moderate language,
adjuring a policy of appeasement and re
conciliation and denying the predictions
that the Nationalist policy implied the an
noyance of foreign visitors.
"Foreigners," he said, ""whether work
ers or pleasure seekers, will have the best
welcome from us." ;

BERLIN, June 2.â Prince Hohenloh**
the Imperial Chancellor, gave assurances
to an informant of the correspondent, of
the Associated Press to-day that the
Bundesrath, in drawing up the para
graphs for the carrying out of the pro
visions of the meat Inspection bill would
frame them in such a manner as to con
sider the legitimate wishes 'of the Ameri
can and British Governments as much as
the tenor of the law would permit.
The Chancellor bitterly complained that
he was now wholly isolated in the Cab
inet on this meat question. Count von
Posadowskis Influence having become
paramount even with the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Baron von Bulow. Un
fortunately, too, Ijr. von Lucanus. the
Emperor's private cabinet chief, and
Count von Posadowski have managed to
make the Emperor believe that the meat
bill compromise as adopted represents a
great victory over the agrarians, in which
his Majesty Innocently rejoices.
The Centrist leader, Herr Lieber. who
has been very ill for months and who
from several visits to America is most
friendly to the United States, has Just re
lurned to the Reichstag, but is still too
weak to reassume the leadership of the
Center. Herr Lieber said he regretted his
forced absence, as he regarded the terms
excluding certain American meats as too
stringent, for he became convinced during
his visits to the United States that the
slaughtering there was good in every re
ppect and that the meat and sausages
there were as healthy as here. --â-:
Looks for Peace in China.
The Foreign Office informed the Asso%
ciated Press correspondent that the situa
tion *n China has improved during the
past few days. The Chinese military au
thorities have shown greater energy and
now seem masters of the situation. The
Foreign Office expects the troubles will be
quieted without further violence.
The Emperor has called an Important
meeting for the Prussian school reform to
convene after the holidays. Proving the
Emperor's intention that reform' must be
toward raising the technical schools to
the level required by the high state of re
cent technical development is the fact
that invitations have been sent to all
rectors of technical high schools and a
number of noted professors like Van Des
bor&ht and Busley.
The Berlin Municipal Council has also
appointed a mixed deputation for a simi
lar end for all the Berlin middle schools.
The Berlin Council has resolved that here
after it will build, operate and maintain
all street car lines for municipal account.
The Siemens-Halske Company at an ex
perimental station at Grosslichterfelde
has built and run on trial electric trains
making eighty to ninety kilometers hour
ly. High civil and military authorities
have inspected the plans satisfactorily
and soon such trains will be introduced
on several lines. Their maintenance is
said to be cheaper than that of other
lines.
The excitement and street riot3 in
Konitz as a result of the death of the lad
Winter, attributed to the Jews, continue
in spite of the active interference of the
military. Martial law has been pro
claimed there. Everybody must lenve the
streets at 9 p. m.. and the military has
been instructed to use rifles if again
attacked. Captain Hesse and Commis
sioner of Police Block were seriously
wounded last night by stones.
"My Navy" Objected To.
A number of influential papers during
the week have published articles about
his Majesty's personal regime, some^p
proving and others disapproving. The
Cologne Volks Zeitung points out that the
Emperor's fashion of speaking about the
German navy as "my navy" is against
the constitution, adding that the advisers
around his Majesty ought to tell him so.
Doubtless tile recent telegrams of the
Emperor to the Prince Regent of Bava
ria, in which the" obnoxious term occur
red, displeased the Bavarian court, as the
wording of the Emperor's telegram as
there published was altered, omitting the
personal pronoun the Emperor had used
The semi-official Post says the South
African war has taught two important les
sons, viz.: The cohesion of the British em
pire even into the farthest independent col
onies, showing that imperial ideas really
have taken root throughout the vast em

to march into , India. All the German
newspapers consider the war virtually

IN REGARD TO
THE MEAT BILL
Made to Believe He Has
Won a Victory Over
Agrarians.
PARIS, June 2.â In the Senate to-day
the Dreyfus case amnesty bill was adopt
ed by 23S to 24 votes. The discussion was
opened with the concluding part of the
speech of M. Trarieux, the former Min
ister of Justice, criticizing the project.
General LamVert followed in defense of
the army, which he said the previous
speaker had insulted, after which the~Pre
mier, M. Waldeck-Rousseau; made a
declaration in behalf of the Government.
The whole of France, said the Premier
applauded the pardon of Dreyfus and
showed thereby that it wished appease
ment/ The Government was of that opin
ion. I It wished to draw, a veil oVer the
weaknesses of individuals instead of pun
ishing them. As to the criticisms of the
bill, he continued, it was quite understood
that those who were disposed to be severe
were those whp had been pitiless. Â¦
But he was of the opinion that it was
necessary above all to unite with the Re
publicans if they wished to save liberty
and the republic. Consequently, he asked
the Senate to record a vote of confidence
fn the Government. "
M. Franck Chauvenau > (Republican)
asked that the bill be referred back to the
committee in order to extend the amnesty
to those condemned by the high court
(Senate). This was rejected by a vote of
1S5 to 101.
M. Lecomte (Republican) then withdrew
his amendment extending the amnesty to
Dreyfus and the bill was adopted by. 23<S
to 34 votes.
At the close of the sitting the Senate
decided by 178 to 144 to have M. Waldeck-

Lcs Angeles' Delegates.
LOS ANGELES, June 2.â The Demo
cratic County Convention met to-day and
selected a delegation of eighty-one mem
bers , to represent Los Angeles County at
the State Convention to be held at Sacra
mento June 14. The delegation will favor
the selection of R. F.' del Valle of this
city and John McGonlgal of Ventura as
two delegates: to the national convention
from this district and the indorsement of
Hon. Stephen M. White as one of the four
delegates-at-large. The platform an
nounces adherence to the principles em
bodied in the Chicago platform of 1S96 and
Indorses William J. Bryan as its . leader.
A -resolution favoring the cause of the
Boers was submitted, but the convention
adjourned ;wlthout taking action on tho
ployes Immediately and not less than 500
additional of them within ninety days al
ter the proposition is accepted.
The proposition further provided that as
soon as the first thousand have been pro
vided for the company shall re-employ as
many more of its former employes as
there shall be places for either by reason
cf vacancies that shall occur or the fu
ture extension of the company's business.
This proposition met with the entire ap
probation of Mr. Whittaker. Governor
Stone called the members of the strikers'
grievance committee together and they
went into secret session to consider the
proposition. The conference was a lengthy
one, continuing until 6 o'clock this even
ing. After the adjournment none of the

would divulge what had transpired.
At the conclusion of the conference Mr.
Stone said the committee had made no

In appointing M. M. Estee to the posl
tlon of United States District Judge for
the Hawaiian Islands President McKin
ley not only gives great satisfaction to
the political and personal friends of that
gentleman but ajwell deserved recognition
of valuable services rendered to the Re
publican party in State and national cam
paigns through many years past.! In
every hard fight Mr. Es^ee has been in the
forefront, giving his time and his talents
to the welfare of his party, and with sig
nal success except in two or three in
stances, when he himself was in a meas
ure a prospective beneficiary.
M.M. Estee was born in the township
of Freehold,' Warren County, Pennsyl
vania, in 1S33.' He worked his way
through college and came to California,
via Panama, In 1853. He stayed in the
mining districts, of El Dorado and Amador
counties until '1857, j when . he began th'e
study of law under the late Judge T. M.
Pawling, after which he removed to Sac
ramento and was admitted to the bar. His
abilities soon attracted attention and In
the course of a few years he had a large
clientele and remunerative business. In
1863 he was elected to the Assembly and
soon after to the position of District Attor
ney for Sacramento County. He moved
to San Francisco in 18C6 and formed the
law partnership of Estee & McLaurin,
which continued until the death of Mr.
Mcl^aurin irt 1S70, when he became asso
ciated in another with Judge J. H. Boalt.
In 1873 Mr. Estee was elected to the As
spmbly, and In the organization of that
body made Speaker. In 1877 he was In
dorsed unanimously by his party friends
for United States Senator, but as they
wero in the minority be was, â¢of, course,
defeated. In the same year he was chosen
as Presidential Elector by his party > and
cast his vote for Hayes. In 18S8 Mr; Estee
was elected chairman of the' Republican
National Convention which nominated
Harijson. 'â¢ Â¦ Â» Â»
He has three times been the candidate
of his party for (Governor of, California,
but by untoward circumstances was each
time defeated.
Mr. Estee lathe author of many l^gral
productions of '> great merit, among which
may be mentioned' his work on pleadings
that Is recognized as a standard and used
throughout the United States.
â¢ Mr. Estee was married in 1863 to Miss
Francis H. Divine, daughter of Judge Da
vis Divine of San Jose, who, : with : their
eldest daughter, Mrs. Charles J. Deering
of this city, Is, still .'living,. A younger
daughter died some weeks ago.
Mr. ' EstPe Is a member of the Masonic
and Odd Fellow orders, in both of which
he has attained high honors. Â¦
APPOINTMENT A SURPRISE
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY
OAKL.AND, . June /2.â The appointment
of M. M. Estee as District Judge of Ha
waii has proved a political sensation v in
Alameda County, where Superior 'Judge
W. .' E. Â¦â" Greene was -.'a ,-; candidate > for; the
place 'and 'was supposed to be absolutely
assured of .the appointment. So sure were
the Alameda â County politicians '. that
Judge; Greene was going to receive i that
appointment | that ] some ; of â¢ the . more Â¦ am
bltlousi.were '.'already ;j figuring upon secur
ing "fr the ''(appointment ; to the^vacancy
caused by his resignation. <. :Â¦:
* Several had.selected- themselves "for the
place,'; for 4 they "knew, that^ Judge. Greene
had secured the ! indorsement -"of the'fen-^
tire California delegation in Congress and
even ; the: Indorsement (of; Congressman de
Vries, . who ; Is a. warm " personal â¢ friend ' of
Judge Greene.' I . r V'^3WSSSBÂ»MiS* | tl a
iÂ»V\Vhen$the< appointment of.,M:jM., Estee
was announced i to-day, there I was a .thrill
of I excitement , that' went down ; the politi
cal > backbone of Alameda . County " and It
was '.very ; evident . that ; somewhere . along
the line a cog had slipped in the political
machinery.
With the appointment of Mr. Estee
came the statement that the cog that
slipped was Senator Perkins. Judge
Greene announced to-night flatly that his
defeat was due to the change of front
upon the part-of Senator Perkins, and he
asserted with equal positivem-ss that had
Senator Perkins stood by his indorsement
he Instead of M. M. Estee would have
been the appointee to-day. As Judge
Greene has been Superior Judge of Ala
meda County for twenty years, and as
Senator Perkins comes from Judge
Greene's county, it makes an interesting
political situation. Upon being interviewed
this evening Judge Greene said: "I was
a candidate for the position of District
Judge of Hawaii, and it was owing to the
fact that Senator Perkins did not stand
by his guns and his indorsements that 1
did not receive the appointment.
"The facts are simple. In 183S the Ha
waiian : Commission, composed of Sena
tors Cullom and Morgan and Representa
tive Hitt, passed through San Francisco
on its way to Hawaii to survey the ground
and prepare a report upon proposed legis
lation for that newly, acquired territory.
I- met: Senator Perkins on the Oakland
boat on his way to attend a reception to
this commission, and the topic of conver
sation naturally became Hawaii. I sug
gested that there would probably be a
district Judgeship created and that I
might be a candidate, and he replied by
at once agreeing to support my candi
dacy.
"The commission returned and reported
in favor of such a proposition, and T wrote
to Senator Perkins, reminding him of our
conversation and his promise to support
me. He replied, saying that he would in
dorse my application and would see the
President In my behalf.
"Senator Perkins and all the California
Representatives in Congress, including De
Vries, in February, 1899. signed the follow
ing recommendation and placed it on file
In the Department of Justice:
To the ' President of the United
States: We do most earnestly and
respectfully recommend for the position
of United States District Judjre for
Hawaii -the Hon. William E. Greene
of- Oakland, Cal. Judge Greene has
been on the bench in this State for a
continuous period of over eighteen
years, and is now one of the Judges of
the Superior Court of this State, In the
county of Atameda.
He Is a man of unimpeachable in
tegrity, of hlch Judicial attainments,
and we 'know that his appointment
would meet with the general approval
of the bench and bar of the Pacific
Coast.
Â¦ "The indorsements by the Judges of the
Supreme Court of this State, Judges Mor
row and De Haven of the Circuit and Dis
trict Courts, United States District Attor
ney Coombs, Governor Gage, the Republi
can members of the Legislature and num
erous personal letters were also forwarded
to the President.
"Then began a correspondence with
Senator Perkins, In which he advised me
how to proceed. He suggested that it
might be well to secure the indorsements
of some of the Eastern Senators, as this
was not necessarily a California appoint
ment. Senators Frye of Maine and Depew
of New York assured my friends of their
support, contingent upon the support of
the California Senators.
"As late as -April 7 Senator Perkins
assured me of his support, yet It was dur
ing March that I am informed he went to
President McKlnley and indorsed M. M.
Estee for the position.
"My. first suspicion that things might
go wrong was when Senator Perkins
wrote me on March .16 last that 'some
of my friends' might not be quite as act
ive in my support as they would were I
not holding- a position which he said I
could hold for life if I desired.
"Mr. Estee's : candidacy began with an
application for a place on the . Philippine
Commission, and he was supported, for
that; place by Senator Perkins. Senator
Perkins was told by President McKlnley
that he had "determined to appoint Pro
fessor Moses and could not then change,
and he expressed a desire to recognize Mr.
Estee, but stated that he saw nothing for
him but the Hawaiian District Judgeshlp.
That. he; would consider him in that con
nection. Â¦ From' that moment, as I am in
formed, Senator Perkins : began his sup
port of Mr. Estee for the place for which
ne had already Indorsed me, and he then
wrote that letter about . some of my
friends, not being so. active in my behalf
because of my holding an office. '
-VI have no regret at losing the appoint
ment, for the position, all things consid
ered, would ha\'e been to me but little bet
ter than the one I now hold. The only re
gret â¢ I have Is that the Senator should
have 'found it necessary or convenient -to
break his word. "I can see no reason that
could have induced Senator Perkins "to
have changed his mind, unless it was his
future Senatorial aspirations which might
have been affected by Mr. Estee were he
to remain in the State."
At a largely attended meeting of dele
gates . from the Mission Improvement
Clubs, held at Anderson's Hall last night.
Mayor Phelan and his Board of Supervis
ors were strongly denounced and some
pointed questions were adopted for
them to answer^ Especial bitterness was
manifested ove? the fact that taxpayers
were not allowed proper representation at
the meeting called to discuss the budget.
The sentiment of the delegates was ex
pressed by a long resolution introduced
by C. F. Kimball of the Nuevo Potrero
Club, the first paragraph of which was^n
emphatic protest against the adoption of
the 'budget prepared by the Finance Com
mittee. Â» -
Proceeding, the document states that
the Finance Committee violated the law
In not making a complete investigation
of departments before deciding on the
items of the budget; that large sums of
money were now being squandered in the
hiring of useless office assistants, ajid that
the federation desired to protest vigor
ously against the "alleged public hearing"
given on the evening of May 31 to tax
payers. The paragraph dealing with this
is as follows: -/ â¢ Â¦Â»..Â¦
We' wish to enter a vigorous protest against
the alleged public hearing, which was an
nounced for Thursday evening. May 31. and we
desire to express our opinion that it appears
to have been called merely as a matter of
form and only as a semblance of complying
with the law, and we believe that there was no
intention on the Dart of the Board of Super
visors to accede to the wishes of the citizens
and taxpayers who so earnestly pleaded for a
small return of the money paid by them in
taxes.'
We had hor>ed that a disposition would be
shown by the Board of Supervisors to make an
effort to check the reckless expenditures and
waste of the taxpayers' money and reduce the
army of taxeaters to conform to the necessities
of business.
We were rrieved to find that neither the
Mayor nor a single member of the board
showed a disposition to champion the cause of
public improvements, but on the contrary the
city officials appeared to be anxious to defend
extravagant offllcals- and reckless waste and
continue the large expenditures.
Then came a set of questions for the
Mayor and his Supervisors to answer, the
most Important one being. "Why should
the cost of operating the government un
der the new charter cost more than under
the consolidation act?"
It was also asked in the resolution if it
was not a fact that under the consolida
tion act large sums were annually set
aside for public improvements, and If It
was not true that the condition of the
city's streets, school buildings and sewers
did not all call for appropriations for im

involving' the right to a flow of water
found in the- soil in .the vicinity of Cuca

ii nit orchards in the vicinity of Cuca
ir.onga have boon supplied with v/ater
from these rprings: as necessity for wa
tor increased artesian wells were. bored
and pumping plants were installed in
adjacent mo.ist lands. The supply seemed
fufflcient for all purposes. In the last dry
seasons the citizens - of Ontario purchased
pome' of the moist lands, bored and took
water at a purchase price of $125,000. The
plaintiffs alleged .this' use by Ontario was
an .abstraction of Cucamonga's ancient
supply and contended for the underground
Â¦stream, but the court found the water to
tie percolating water and any one could
take 1t and u&p it where he pleased In any
quantity, provided he owned the land
from which it is taken.

Headache may be called a woman's
ailment. Some men suffer from it. But
almost all women have to endnre its pain
with each recurring mon^h. This fact
points at once to the intimate relation
between the health of the delicate
womanly organs, and the general health
of the whole body. Dr. Pierce's Favor-
ite Prescription banishes headache by
banishing its cause. It cures the dis-
eases which irritate the delicate womanly
organs, fret the nerves and waste the
strength. .It increases the vitality and
buildsup the nervous system. "Favorite
Prescription? contains no opium, cocaine
or other narcotic. '
Â« I want to praise your medicine," writes Mrs.
Sarah J. Burney. of Cresent City. Putnam Co

have been almost in bed five years, and now I
am able to work all day. I have taken eight

?v i C S j I praise your medicine to all. I had

SAXTA ROSA. June 2.â Some sensa
tional testimony was Introduced at the
Wilcox tnurder trial here to-day. For the
'past three weeks the case has occupied
the attention of Judge Burnett and a jury
in : Department 2 oi the Superior Court.
Over 'ja. - -hundred witnesses have been
heard and the case has been bitterly con
tested.' Â¦ The trial Is now drawing to a
close, the witnesses to-day being those
called by the prosecution in rebuttal, both
sides having rested early in the week.
Tne defense has sought to prove that
Wilcox was insane wnen he killed his
â¢vviie at Lytton Springs three months ago,
and that for a number of years his ac
tions have been peculiar. Among the wit
nesses to-dav was Dr. F. S. Byington, who
i-s at the head of the Jenner Sanitarium
in this city. Dr. Byington stated that in
his <- pinion Wilcox was perfectly sane and
responsible for all his actions. During the
course of the trial several other physi
cians have testirtÂ£-d to the exact contrary.
In giving his testimony Dr. Byington
was most positive, lie detailed a number
of conversations had with Wilcox after
1 is arrest and stated that on one occasion
when hf- was visiting the prisoner in Jail
Wil-cox atkod him what he should dp and
how he should act In order to create the
inij're.=!=ioh of his insanity. To this the
physician replied that he was doing very
well as* It was and he had no suggestions
to 'offer. Wilcox said to the witness at
parting. that he expected him to do what
he could to keep him out of the difficulty.
To this Dr. Byington stated he made no
reply. A great deal of interest has been
taken In 4 the case all over Sonoma. Lake
;>.ii<r Kapa counties, and Dr. Uylngton'a
testimony to-day created a sensation.

BLISDEL CASE AGAINST
UNCLE SAM DISMISSED
End of Litigation Involving a Claim
of More Than Sixty-Five Mil
lion Dollars.
WASHINGTON. June 2.â One of the
largest suits ever instituted against the
Government has been dismissed by the
United States Court of Claims. It- was
known as the Bllsdel case and involved
$64,623,512 alleged to be due to the heirs
of Charles Durkee of Kcnosha, Wls., for
certain first mortgage Pacific Railroad
bonds, which it was alleged came into
Durkee's possession while Governor of
Utah in 1S65. It was claimed these bonds
subsequently were deposited in the treas
ury of the United States in trust for the
owner and that the Governor collected
the principal and -interest thereon, but
never accounted to Durkee or his helrsv
for any part of the same. J
In view of the fact that the case has
been pending In the court for a number
of years without any competent evidence
to support it. Assistant Attorney General
Pratt decided to push it_to a conclusion,
with the result that it was dismissed. It
Is claimed the case was being used to get
money from persons throughout the coun
try, who were not in a position to know
the facts, for the alU-ged purpose of car
rying on the prosecution of it. In one
caee, it is said, the promoters agreed to
give $1,000,000 in the claim for $500/ and in
another case an agreement was filed for
$8 000.000, the consideration ~cing $4000.
The officials of the Department of Justice
declare there never was the least basis
in law for the claim.

HOT MORNING BREAKFAST
Comfort Depends on Food.
It is not so easy to arrange a tempting*
breakfast for a hot morning, but every-
orieapprcciates such a breakfast and en-
â¢ joys the relief from the heated blood
caused tÂ»y a meat and coffee breakfast.
In fact, by skillful selection of food.
even the hottest day can be made quite
comfortable. s
Stan with fruit of some kind, then a
dish of Gr.ape-Nuts food with cold
cream, one or two soft boiled eprjfs. a
slice of bread and butter and a cup of
cocoa or Postum Food Coffee. On that
sort of meal one will be fully nourished
until the mid-day.
Grap?-N*uts food is concentrated and
powerful, imparting to the user a sense
of reserve force and urencth. The
strong man thinks the weather moderate
arr 1 . comfortable when the nervous,
weak man thinks it unbearably hot.
Grape-Nuts food is perfectly cooked at
the factory and ready for instant usei
cool and delicious, requirinc: no. hot
stove and cross cook on a hot morninc
"Health is a matter, of wise selection of
food and a contented mind."

LEGISLATION VERSUS DEMAGOGY.
.' .When the' anti-trust resolution came up for debate
on Thursday Richardson, the Democratic leader, en
deavored to. find a way to enable his followers to get
out of the dilemma that confronted them. He did not
Â¦vyish to go on record as opposing anti-trust legisla
tion, but* at the same time he was eager to prevent the
Republican .party from providing it, so he demanded
permission to offer amendments. The effort, how
ever, was blocked, .and in roply to a question why
.Â¦amendments were not permitted Grosvenor answered:
"Our justification is a perfect one. This is a proposi
tion' of the majority. We will be held responsible.
The' opposition will not share the burden, if burden
â¢ it be. 2cfore the next session cf Congress the people
vHl have ample time to pass upon it This is a radi
cal action. . I v.as inclined to criticize it when the
Democratic leader, Mr. Bryan, suggested it in Chi
cago. I criticized it as undemocratic. Since that
lime Mr! Bryan has remained silent, but we are now
lie're- submitting it to 3*ou. You can either approve it
cr go on record against it."
Finding themselves unable to dodge the issue, and
being thus forced to approve the resolution or go on
record against it, the Democrats chose the latter al
ternative. Bailey of Texas made a long harangue in
which he declared the Republicans are hypocrites
and have no intention of passing the resolution. To
-.that charge the reply was easy. If the Republicans
had no intention to pass the resolution it was in the
power of the Democrats to show the fact by voting
for the measure and thus compelling the Republicans
either to pass it or to vote against it. Nothing could
be 1 easier than to expose an hypocrisy of the kind
Bailey had charged, but the result proved that Bailey
himself did not have confidence enough in his own
charge to put it to a test.
In summing up the debate Dalzell pointed out that
the difference between the political parties on this
issue is that the Democratic and Populistic parties
confine their opposition to speech-making, while the
Republican party believes in legislation. The Repub
lican party, he went on, placed on the statute-books
in 1890 the Sherman anti-trust law. The Democrats
came into power in 1892 on -a platform containing n
Â£trorg phr.l; against trusts. For four j-ears their
executive did not even take steps to enforce the law
the Republicans had enacted. The great Populistic-
Dcmocratic leader at Chicago declared that a consti
tutional amendment should be passed giving Congress
the. power to regulate trusts. "Yet. when we come
here," said he, "with that very remedy, the leader on
the other side appeals to h:s colleagues to stand
against it. You charge us with bad faith. You say
that no constitutional amendment that infringes the
power of the States should be passed. Your objec
tion is not to the form, but to the subject. The
remedy proposed by the gentleman from Texas al
ready exists. The Supreme Court has decided that it
is not sufficient. With that remedy alone Congress is
powerless. If the trusts are not to be frightened at
the prospect of this legislation it is because they know
that between it and them stands the Democratic party
in solid phalanx. You believe in demagogy- on the
etump; we believe in effective legislation upon the
statute-books."
That is an exact statement of the attitude of the
parties on the subject. Bryanlsm is for demagogy on
the stamp and Republicanism is for legislation on the
statute-books. With the exposure thus made of the
insincerity of Democratic clamors it is not- likely any
considerable number of voters will be fooled when
the Eryanites renew their howlings against trusts
during the coming campaign.
Q Â¦ S was foretold by The Call, the Democrats in
j \' Congress, after having loudly clamored
Â¦ . " Â¦ agaiirst trusts and 'demanded governmental
supervision and regulation, refused to support a
definite policy of regulation proposed by the Repub
vlicans of the House, and denounced with great vo
.ciferation an attempt on the part of the Republicans
to so amend the constitution as to give Congress
power to deal with such combinations effectively and
; guard the pub'.ic against the evils that result from
thcn - ' â¢ .â¢ . ...
Whether anything at all will be done by the Minis
try is doubtful,. but the correspondent of the. 'Gazette
says: "The idea of a separate state need not perhaps
be entertained seriously, though the reformers are
asking for it in a petition to the Queen which con
tains 26,000 signatures. The interesting point will be
whether, granted the undeniable and great under
representation of the, goldfields in the Western Aus
tralian; Parliament, Mr. Chamberlain can, with any
shred of consistency, abstain . from bringing the
strongest pressure to bear upon the Western Austra
lian Ministry in order that such adequate representa
tion may be accorded to -the mining communities as
shall enable' them to -redress their grievances.
It is not at all likely that the agitation will ever
be much more than a tempest in a teapot, and yet it
is an interesting illustration of British nature that so
much rage has arisen throughout the empire against
the Boers for restrictions placed upon foreign gold
seekers in the Transvaal while the Australians them
selves are placing exactly the same kind of restric
tions upon the gold-seekers in their country. The
Boers have the justification that they were trying
to protect their republic from domination by an alien
race, but the Western Australians have been guard
ing themselves < against their own countrymen. It is
therefore clear that if the British Ministry had even
the shadow of right to interfere in the Transvaal for
the protection of British subjects, it has an unques
tionable right to : interfere in Western Australia.
When it was made certain the Western Australian
Government would not concede them the desired
representation the Uitlanders organized a "Gold
fields' Reform League," and began to agitate for the
establishment of a separate government of their own.
The district which they proposed to have organized as
the state of Goldfields is said to contain more than
half the present population of Western Australia, and
yet it has only ten representatives in an Assembly of
fifty members, and but six ;n a Legislative Council of
thirty members. As an illustration of the injustice
of the situation it is pointed out that in one of the
older towns of the province 235 electors choose two
representatives in the Assembly, while only one. is
sllotted to the 3379 electors in Northeast Coolgardie.
ANOTHER UITLANDER GRIEVANCE.
WHENEVER the British Government com*
pletes the work of conquering the. Transvaal
Republic in the interest of the Uitlanders, and
satisfying all the claims of the gold-seekers against
the original possessor of the land, it will find more
work of the same kind awaiting attention in West
ern Australia. l\ appears the discovery of the gold
fields in that province has produced there a situation
almost identical with that which prevailed in the
Transvaal just before the war. .,:â¢
A correspondent of the London Westminster Ga
zette, in describing the controversy now going on
in the province, says that prior^to the discovery of
the goldfields the growth of population in Western
Australia had been â¢ so slow that when responsible
government was finally granted in 1890 the total
population was but'45,ooo,'and the annual revenue
scarcely exceeded Â£400.000. At the end of 1898 the
population was estimated to be nearly 170,000, and the
revenue was Â£2,600,000. The increase in population
was almost entirely due to immigration from the
eastern Australian States. They had not been long
in their new homes before they began to complain
that the expanding revenue was being spent to an
excessive extent in the interests of the coastal dis
tricts, and to agitate for parliamentary representation
in proportion to their numbers. With this request
the Government refused to comply, on the ground of
the greater stake in the country possessed by those
employed in agricultural and pastoral pursuits.
For these 18,656 children y.-ho ought to be in school
but who arc not the State of California pays the city
of San Francisco the sum of $167,904. That money
should be spent for the education of those children
and not for the education of some other children.
Here is a problem which, demands the earnest con
sideration of the Board of Education during the sum
mer vacation. Another school year should not be
allowed to open without something being done to
improve the present deplorable condition of affairs.
Charity begins at home. We are civilizing the
Filipinos with shot, powder and whisky; what* are
we doing to civilize our own street arabs?
According to this report the number of children
between 5 and 17 in our public schools was 50,587;
private schools, 9311; total, 59.898.- "The number of
children who have not attended any school, public or
private, was 18.656. This showing is a trifle better
than that of last year, but there are still far too many
children running the streets or working for the sup
port of parents .who ought to be supporting them.
T\ FEW days ago The Call directed attention to
[\. the necessity for enforcing the compulsory
* education law. This necessity is emphasized by
the recently published reportyof the school census
raarslir.1 for the year tnding June 30, 1900.
OUR STREET ARABS.

WHAT VALUE HAVE THE PHILIPPINES?
IT is daily becoming more evident that the natural
resources and commercial possibilities of the
Philippines have been greatly overestimated.
Every trained observer who comes home and tells his
story does something.to dispel the illusion that in the
far-disiant China Sea we have wrested from the' Span
iards a second El Dorado. .. : :
The unconscious testimony of an unwilling witness
is always the best.- Such testimony is offered by Mr.
George F. Becker, United* States Geologist, who in
the June Scribner's answers in the affirmative the
question, Are the Philippines worth having? The
facts he presents hardly justify his conclusion.
First, as to climate. . The statistics of rainfall and
temperature which Mr. Becker presents seem to show
that white men ought to be as healthy in the Philip
pines as in our Southern Stated But the reports of
our army surgeons show conclusively that they are
not, and the loads 6f dismal deadâ few of whom have
been killed in* batfleâ brought home by each return
ing transport prove that the tropics are indeed the
white man's grave. -\ '
For the unskilled whitelaborer the Philippines offer
no advantages whatsoever. This is now generally
recognized, and Mr. Becker grants this fact as "self
evident." His contention that if this be a valid ob
jection to holding the Philippines we should 'not hold
the Gulf States eitherâ this contention overlooks the
consideration that you do not solve a complicated
domestic problem by adding to it a complicated for
eign problem; you merely, make matters worse.
The prosperity of the Gulf , States depends upon
negro labor, and the negro question is the most dif
ficult and dangerous public question with which we
have to deal to-day.
If not a trained sociologist, Mr. Becker is a trained
geologist. His admissions as to the poverty of the
Philippines in gold, iron, coal and forests have there
fore a value which cannot be claimed for his political
theories. Of gold he says: "I have been able to ob
tain no information warranting the belief; that. there
is any highly important gold-field in the archipelago.
* . .?-Â¦ *,, I consider the gold resources of the Phil
ippines comparable with those of the, Carolinas and
Georgia rather than with those of Colorado or^Cali
foraia." The so-called coal he declares to be "not
a true coal, but a lignitcpf the eocene age.^ *, â¢â¢Â¦* .'.*
Its heating effect is fromvtwo-thirds to three-quar
ters that of Cardiff coal." Of.iron ore all that Mr.
Becker can say is that it "exists in IyUzon." He has
tens to add: "Without true coal, however, the iron
industry cannot become a great one." The -forest
area : he estimates at 40.000 square , miles. The insig
nificance of this is brought out when we remember
that the Pacific States alone contain 53,000,000 acres
of forest land, the United States 500,000,000, in addi
tion to 860,000,006 acres], of waste or unoccupied land
capable of timber, production. Â¦

a man of education " and research

with every class of Mongolian, his views
on the situation in China are of interest.
He said the spread of the Christian faith
and even its very existence depend abso
lutely upon the success there of the party

"If the Empress Dowager had her way
and were not kept In check by the fear of

said Rev. Mr. Headland. "The unruly

only too anxious to seize every opportun

itself unable to suppress these bandits,
whose excesses imperil the life of every

take their lives Into their own hands and
with more zeal than discretion penetrate

only claim to the throne is that he is the
brother of this old woman's husband or

vast empire, the lad is but fifteen years of

I am not sure but that there Is a play In
Mr. "W. C. Morrow's excellently written
novel, "A Man:*Hl3 Mark" (LJppincott).
There Is certainly a fine theme â the hero
ism of a man whom neither detraction nor
the opportunity for revenge can turn
aside from the performance of dutyâ and
there are also at least two Intensely dra
matic situations. The order of scenes In
the play would have to differ from that
In the novel ; rearranged, they would come
about as follows:
Act 1 would be laid in San Francisco anf
would center around Laura. It would
show her quarrel with her lover due to
her jealousy of Ada: her plan for reveng
ing herself upon Ada by convincing: Wil
der that Ada had thrown him over, tna
means by which she carried out thta plan
and the resultant death of Ada. "Wilder,
of course, must not be allowed to see)
Laura In this act or to have the least sus

death. Act 2 would show the Interior or
Wilder*s hut on the slopes of Mount Shas
ta. To this rude refuge hÂ© would bring
Laura, whom he had rescued from a Jan
uary storm. In which her father had been
killed. (In ijii3 act I would have none of
the traumaflirgy and the chirurgery with
which Mr. Morrow has plentifully be
sprinkled the scene and which constitute.
It seems to me. a blemish In his work.) In
the course of their conversation Laura
should tell to Wilder the story (Just as she
does In the*novel> of how she separated
him from Ada. Here is one of the two
dramatic situations I referred to. Then
would come the tremendous scene in
which he denounces her as a murderess,
threatens to execute Justice upon her, but
finally, recalled by sense of what is due
to her sex and position, stays his hand
Act 3 would show Laura and wilder still
Imprisoned In the hut, would show him
weak and ill from starvation endured that
she might have sufficient from his scanty
stock of food; would show her unconscious

rescue by the real Dr. Malbone: the
revelation by him to Laura of the real
situation and the death of Wilder In the
arms of the woman who had so cruelly
wronged him. â¢ " m
Thi3 play would have no comic relief:
this play would end tragically, because
logically; this play -would be a represen

series of dramatic happenings true to life.

rational and interesting a play could be

comes a glory which rises far above all
considerations of esteem ?r praise or pub

SV\ R -' GOODWIN'S contention Is un?
Ill doubtedly true. We are only a
I I I few tens of thousands . of years
II from the pithecoid ape and "a
"/ . . Â¦;" considerable portion" of . the ; pub
lic does still ."want the nasty things", of
the "stage. Little more than 200 years ago,
as wo may see In the comedies of iCon
greve and Wyeherley, the entire theater
going public wanted things put down even
below the level of "Zaza" and "The Tur
tle." Now the mudlarks, are In a minority
and the' police have clipped their wings
so that they cannot dive as low as they
were wont. There has been some pro- /
gress. Â¦
Mr. Goodwin's courage In tellling the
mudlarking portion of the public Just
what he thinks of It is unconventional and
admirable. But 1 cannot follow him when
he claims that the presentation of a mere
tricious play is entirely the public's af
fair and not at all the actor's. On this
principle the public should allow an open
market for the rotten fruit and diseased
milk; the fellows who Bell this rotten
fruit and diseased milk should not be re
strained, for it must be the public's busi
ness whether It buy the stuff or not. Yet
experience has shown It is both wise and
necessary to prosecute sellers of diseased
food; they are enemies to the health of
society. Â¦ .
"Why blame the actor?" asks Mr. Good
win. First, because an actor is a man
and a citizen, who, like every other citi
zen, must refrain from any public exhi
bition that offends public morals; second,
because an actor who* expects the public
to respect him must respect himself.
It looks a little as If Mr. Go"odwln were
fearful - lest the public and the critics
should take "When We j Were Twenty-
One" for an Immoral play or a forbidden
topic. If this be so, I am sorry he gave
us credit for so little power of discrimina
tion. We understand, I think, that the
theater is not a kindergarten; that it is
not even a place pour les Jeunes fllles;
that It is rather an institution that ap
peals more powerfully than even the
novel to a vast class of men and women;
people who are capable of thinking -for
themselves, but who realize generalized
truths most strongly when presented to
them through the medium of the emo
tions. Such people ask only of the dra
matist that his treatment be serious and
in conformity with the laws of human ex
perience. This observed, there are very
few subjects they would consider im
proper for stage treatment.

BUBONIC plague does not exist in Chinatown. As an epidemic it never existed
there. That much has been made evident by the investigations of Dr. "George F.
Shrady, the eminent specialist who came from New York at the request of The
Call and the Herald to seek oift the truth and make it known. Every step taken in his
investigation and all the results obtained thereby have been frankly stated over his own
signature. Nothing has been exaggerated, por has anything been concealed. The
rumors arising from ignorance or from half knowledge have been refuted and the scare
dissipated. The situation is cleared up. San Francisco has nothing to fear from China
town if ordinary care be exercised, nor have other localities anything to fear from San
Dr. Shrady's final words upon the subject are emphatic and convincing. In an in
terview published in The Call yesterday he said: "In consideration of the fact that the
people of the United States have expressed great uneasiness at the situation in San
Francisco, I want to declare positively that there is not the remotest danger of con
tagion in San Francisco if the proper radical measures recommended are carried out. I
do not apprehend any danger in the future. It seems to me so evident from the present
condition of things that plague does not exist in San Francisco that I would not hesi
tate to spend the summer in this city with my family if it were necessary so to do, be
lieving thus that I would run no special danger and with the knowledge that I would be
absolutely free from contagion."
The declaration of this eminent authority that there is no danger of bubonic plague
in San Francisco, based as it is upon conclusions drawn from a thorough investigation
which disclosed only a few sporadic cases of plague in Chinatown, and not one single liv
ing case, will put an end to any further anxiety on the subject among intelligent people
of all parts of the country. With that phase of the situation, then, we need deal no fur
ther. There remains to consider the counsel of Dr. Shrady- given to the city itself;
that of the duty of cleaning Chinatown of all its filth and disease-breeding germs, and
keeping it clean hereafter so long as it stands in the city.
Upon that point Dr. Shrady's language is worth noting, and remembering: "You
must not make an excuse to clean the spot because there is plague here," he .;aid,
"but you must act solely on the ground that the district is in a filthy condition." That is
the sum and substance, the pith and point of "the issue. The"' movement ,-f or the cleansing
of Chinatown is not called for by any menace of bubonic plague, *nor : should it be un
dertaken as a temporary remedy applied to a temporary evil. It must be planned and
directed toward the eradication of everything that is pestilential or foul in the Chinese
quarter, and it must be f maintained as a permanent part of the health regulations of the
city. In other words, Chinatown must be first thoroughly disinfected, the underground
burrows closed up, the buildings put into good sanitary conditions, and then the health
and fire regulations of the city must be enforced there with firmness and with thorough
ness from this time on. â¢ . /
The prompt and liberal response which the business men of 'the city have made to
the call for money to aid in the work of the health authorities , is- in the highest degree
gratifying. Such large subscriptions and voluntary contributions to the fund will give
to the country at large the amplest and best assurance that the people of San Francisco
do not intend to take chances with pestilence, nor will they hesitate in applying the re
quired remedy for such evils as exist, no matter what it may cost.
Such being the condition of affairs, there need be no longer any anxiety about the
plague, nor about any menace which may have been lurking in the slums of Chinatown.
San Francisco is all right. -'

SETS ASIDE THE
CURTIS BILL
WASHINGTON, June 2.â Only one vote
was cast in the House to-day against the
Llttlefleld anti-trust bill to amend the
Sherman act of 1SD0 to make it more ef
fective in | the prosecution of trusts and
combinations, their agents, officers or at
torneys. Mann (R.) of Illinois cast the
negative vote; The bill, according to the
statements of the Republican leaders,
goes to the limit of the authority of Con
gress under the constitution. AH the
Democratic : minority amendments except
one were defeated. That was an amend
ment declaring that nothing in the act
should' be construed to apply to trades
unions or labor organizations. All except
eight Republicans â Aldrich of Alabama,
Alien and -Â¦ Littleneld of Maine, Bailey,
Long and Calderhead of Kansas and Can
non and Hltt of Illinoisâ voted foriit. .
The bill amends the Sherman anti-trust
law so as- to declare every contract or
combination in, the 'form of trust or con
spiracy in restraint of commerce among
the States or â¢ with Â¦ foreign nations ; illegal,
nnd every party to such contract or com
bination guilty of a. crime punishable by a

ple and by the people and for the people,
and fundamental law governing a people gov
erns every inch of their possessions.
The constitution of the United States is pat
in force here. The Cherokee law provides,
among ether things, that citizen* of the Chero
kee Nation may go upon the public domain
and make Improvements and that the Improve
ments become an Inheritable estate. It Is pro
vided by the constitution of the Cherokee Na
tlcn, and thlÂ» Is not In conflict with the con
stitution of the United States, that the Im
provements made by a citizen of the Cherokee
Nation are not subject to attachments or sale
under execution. It Is a vested property right.
By a provision of the fifth article of thÂ«
amendments to the constitution of the United
States It is provided that a person Â»hall not
be deprived of life. liberty and property with
out due process of law. The Supreme Court of
the United States and other courts of last re
port have decided that an act of Congress Is
net "due process of law." In order to be due
process of law there mupt be an action brought
in a court of competent Jurisdiction, where the
rights of the plaintiff are presented on the one
hand and the rights of the defendant are pre
sented ty way of answer and then the ques
tion at Issue be determined Judicially by. the
court. That has been decided to be due pro
cess of law. The Congress of the United States
has endeavored In the seventeenth and eight
eenth sections of the Curtis act to eay that
citizens subject to the constitution. Its amen
ities and protection, may be deprived of prop
erty which the laws of the Cherokeo Nation
and the constitution of the United States
â¢authorize them to hold and enjoy without due
process of law. The court decides that that
cannot be legally done. The court further de
cides that one citizen cannot take it upon
himself to determine that another man has In
his possession .more than his proportionate
chare of the public domain of the Cherokee
Nation. There is not a man alive to-day who
can say what the proportionate share of a
citizen of the Cherokee Nation Is.
That <>Â¦ a matter which can only be deter
mined when allotment Is made, or when It Is
known exactly how much there Is of It and
when a census has b*Â«i made and it is known
to a Fir.trle individual the number of Cherokee
citizens, then, and net until then, would it be
possible to determine what the proportionate
fchare of each Cherokee citizen Is. The court
will not say that the Cherokee Nation, by
proper process, might not condemn, if it werr
discovered after allotment that a man had In
his possession more than his proportionate
Â»hare, that the Cherokee Nation, as a govern
ment and as the representative of this com
mon property, might not proceed to have this
property condemned, giving compensation to
the owner of the property for the improve
ments, and then throw it open for settlement
or selection as a part of the public domain,
but he cannot be deprived of It without due
process of law. and until it is determined . that
he has more than he is'entltlrd to even the
Cherokee Nation cannot have him dispossessed.
One citizen cannot 6ay: "Here, John Jones.
you have more than you are entitled to; I have
been lazy and Improvident and have not tried
to B*t a farm, you have gone to work and
oi^ned out this possession and the improve
ments under the law;- you have more than your
tbare and I am polnp to take it for my home."
John Jon** says: "Tou will not take it until
I have been raid for my Improvements." â¢ -
The Curtis bill Is very sweeping. It contains
many provisions and is capable of many differ
ent constructions. It is ,: the first - : serious . at
tempt the court haÂ« ever seen of Congress at
tempting to repeal an amendment to the con
stitution by an act of Congress. ' But the court
lr of the opinion that the Curtis bi II does ' not
repeal the constitution of the United States,
nor any of 1U provisions, and U wholly lnon-
eratlve. since the Cherokee Nation has not en
tered Into a treaty authorizing the allotment
of their 4 omm<>n Property.
What the condition of affairs mlgrht be lr
there had been a treaty entered into between
the United States Government and the Chero
kee Nation authorizing- the allotment of their
landsâ disturbing the present titleâ Is quite an
other thing. This land was bought and paid
for by the Cherokee Indians with their own
money and their own property. It was pat
ented to them. It has been urged that the
Cherokees are Indians and wards of the Gov
ernment, that Congress has the right to gov
ern them as it sees fit; that they are wards
of the Government, In other words, minors,
and that the Government has the right to ruie
them. Cut it appears to me that that view
would hardly be Justified by law. and, in fact,
the court thinks It could not be tolerated for
a minute. These Indians were regarded as of
age and able to contract when the Government
bought their property from them: when they
bought the Cherokee Strip and their lands in
Georgia and Tennessee. The plea of Infancy can
only be pleaded by the Infant and not by any
other party. The Government cannot plead that
these are infants, slnee the Government by its
own contract recognizes their right to con

foreheads significantly when the venture
was discussed, but William J. Pattosien,
the president and organizer of this com
jar.y, knew what he was about. He
v.-anted plenty of room and light. These
could not be obtained down town, and
the nearest approach to them would cost
a b!g sum for rent. At a tenth of the cost

Combination Against the
Cannery Trust Recom
mended.
YGBA CITY, June 1.â This is the cen
ter of the fruit producing industry
of the upper Sacramento Valley, and
is the most important center for
peaches and pears in the State, and in
interviews recently had? with several of
the growers we find that an organization
of the growers to control prices Is not a
new idea. ''1
S J Stabler of the Stabler orchard
say's: "The Sutter County fruit-growers
have for the past two years organized for
the purpose of maintaining fair prices at
thl canneries and in the event of failure
to do this the fruit would be either dried
or shipped to Eastern markets and that
each year the results have been very
satisfactory. As yet no organization of
this kind has been attempted in this sec
tion this year, but it will be made before
the ripening of the peach and pear crop.
He thinks producers had better let the
canning but-int&s alone, that it is so en
tirely out of their line no reasonable suc
cess could be hoped for; that if the local
canneries will not accede to their de
mand? the producer had better take
chances by drying or shipping to Eastern
tti i rkcts
J B. Wllkie thinks the producers should
combine or they will be forced to ship
to Eastern markets or dry their crops;
that the action of the cannery people is
too plain to admit of any doubt as to their
intention. An organization of this kind
of a majority of growers throughout the
State would bring the canners to terms,
but he does not.think enough of the pro
ducers will enter into the combine to
make it effective. . . : .^
L A. Walton thinks a combine of the
growers in localities that produce largely
one or two varieties of fruit, as a combine
of the cherry-growers of Alameda or the
peach-growers of Sutter, would be the
proper course to take and would main
tain good prices at the canneries for those
kinds of fruit. A combine of the pro
ducers of the State could not be effected;
that this locality has for two years been
greatly benefited by the organization of
the growers and he hopes to see another
similar organization this season. He
says no contracts for crops In this sec
tion have been made as yet; that the
peach-growers can dry their crops if a
satisfactory price cannot be had from the
J. H. Backus thinks a combine of grow
ers in localities should at no Xime be over
looked and If necessary organize for the
purpose of canning and marketing their
own products, though nothing so elabor
ate as this has ever been attempted here;
that if something of this kind is not done
the growers must dry their fruit or ac
cept whatever the canneries may offer.
H. P. Stabler thinks a combination for
self-protection is just^what every fruit
producing community should undertake
and while the organization In this local
ity for two years past has been beneficial
to the grower it has not been as satisfac
tory as he would like to see it. The pro
ducers have not "sand" enough to stand
solidly together and say to the canneries,
"Good prices or no sale." He commends

Growers by Standing Firm
Will Be Enabled to Baffle
the Combine.
SAN JOSE, June 1.â Santa Clara
County cherry and other fruit-grow
ers do not fear the cannery com
bine, in fact they are confident that
if Alameda fruit men hold out they will
be masters of the situation. Two remedies
are suggested â one that the growers can
or ship their products and the other that
they dry their cherries. This county's
crop is being mostly shipped and the can
neries in the combine would be unable to
secure many cherries. Apricot-growers
always get a good price from canneries
because many of them prefer to dry their
fruit.
F. M. Burkholder, a grower and. buyer
for several companies outside of the eom-
NAPA. June 1.â The Call correspond
ent has within the past few days in
terviewed many of the prominent
fruit growers in this vicinity to as
certain their opinions and views in regard
to the cannery trust that has been formed,
and also to get their ideas as to the ac
tion recently taken by the fruit growers of
San Leandro against the combine. Some
gave thc-'.r views very freely for publica
tion, while others do not care to have
their n;;mes appear in print. In general
the growers of Napa are in favor of com
bining whenever thfir interests are threat
ened. Napa fruit growers, as a rule, have
always fcund a market for their fruit at
good prices, and have had very little deal
ings with the cannery men. This year,
however, a large number of the prune
growers here have joined the California
Cured Fruit Association, believing that it
is to their best interests.
Napa fruit is shipped East In large
quantities, and some finds a market in
San Francisco. .,; Â¦.--.:"-â¢
William Hunter, who has a large or
chard north of town, said: "I believe the
fruit growers should always stand to
gether on any proposition that is advanced
to further their interests. 1 am not a
cherry grower and do not feel that I am
qualified to give an opinion in regard to
the differences existing between the can
nery combine and the San Leandro. fruit
growers. All I can say is that I believe
that the fruit growers should stand to
gether."
William M. Fisher, who \ ships large
quantities of fruit to the Eastern markets
and to San Francisco, said: "I think that
the San Leandro fruit growers have done
a wise thing in forming a combine against
the cannery men. and br-lieve that the
fruit growers phould stand together and
get all they can for their product. If they
would do this always they would get bet
ter returns for their fruit."
Growers Should Stand To
gether to Further Their
Interests.
the action of the growers at Haywards
and says that that community has the
capital to back up their threats.
G. W. Harney, manager of the Abbott
orchard, thinks the alarm of the fruit
growers is unwarranted: that prices will
be satisfactory and that there is no occa
sion for such steps as have been taken at
San Leandro and Haywards; that a prop
osition to build and operate a cannery by
the growers would be a hazardous under
taking as it takes both capital and ex
perience to successfully operate a can
nery. When conditions are favorable for
urying this process of handling the fruit
would be far more profitable and fraught
with less danger than to undertake to can.
SANTA CLARfl.
YUBA.
It may be seen that the growers in this
section depend largely upon drying their
fruit. Practically every grower is pre
pared to dry his fruit; especially is this
so this season, owing to the light crop.
If the cannery trust desires to purchas*
Ventura County apricots for canning they
must pay a fair and reasonable price for
the same. The local growers have tho
reputation of â¢ being extremely Inde
pendent.
The apricots will commence ripening
rapidly about July 1. The buyers to se
cure fruit by contract should be in tha
field by June 15. The growers will be will
ing to sell to the cannery trust provided
the combination pays a fair price.
Heretofore growers have depended on
drying, and they have generally secured,
excellent prices for their dried apricots.
The Sacramento Packing Company paid
from $20 to $T>0 per ton for green apricots
last year. The dried product sold at an
average of a fraction above 10 cents por
pound.
A. Everett, who Is one of the largest
apricot growers in the county, stated that
the cannery combination or trust could
not hurt Ventura growers, who can dry
their fruit and secure a good flsrure for
their crop. To fight the trust a State or
ganization of growers would be the proper
course to follow.
VETNTURA. June 1.â The fruit growers
of this county, fortunately, will not
be at the mercy of the cannery trust.
Apricots are practically the only fruit
raised extensively In this county. The
total crop this season is estimated at 3000
tons of green fruit, as against 9000 tons
last year. The Sacramento Packing Com
pany erected a $12,000 cannery in this city
fast year. They purchased some io0 tons
of green apricots, most of which they
canned at their local plant. There was
an additional tons of green fruit
shipped to canneries at Los Angeles, San.
Francisco and Colton. In 1S9S some Â«w0
tons of apricots were shipped to outslda
Growers fire Independent

MARYSVILLE, June 1.â "v7. H. Raub
said: "The question is a hard prob
lem to solve, and although I have
given the matter considerable
thought I am not satisfied as to which
would be the best course to pursue, but I
am inclined to the opinion that we grow
ers should prepare to dry and can our own
produce on the co-operative plan. It is an
easy matter to dry our fruit, but to can it
is a different Droposition, and then to mar
ket it is another doubtful question. How-
Growers Should Dry and Can

C. E. Bills, manager of Porter Bros.,
does not think the combine of canners can
carry things their own way if the growers
will only stnnd firm. The canners must
have cherries and they cannot be secured
in this county. The shippers will handle
most of the cherry crop of this counts
and good prices are being realized in thq
East. Growers will receive from 5Â»Â£ to 8
cents per pound net from their shipments.
F. M. Woods, a grower, suggested that
the Alameda County cherry men can or
dry their fruit. He advises them to pre
pare at once to handle their apricots and
poaches. The many driers in Santa
Clara County place the growers here out
of the reach of the canners* combine.
bine, says he Is paying 6 cents per pound
for cherries. He declares the Flickinger.
Ainsley, Golden Gate, Code-Portwood and
Pacific companies are not standing with
the combine and the Los Gatos company
is evidently playing between the grower
and combine. The Los Gatos company is
paying 5% cents per pound for cherries,
but in paying this half cent above the
combine price they write across the con
tract, "These cherries are not for can
ning purposes." Mr. Burkholder sug
gests that Alameda County growers fix a
set price and if they do not get it either
can or dry their product.
Some cherries are dried in Santa Clara
County and they seem to be profitable In
this form.
Colonel Phllo Hersey, president of the
Santa Clara County Fruit Exchange,
thinks the San Leandro cherry men are
at the mercy of the canners. It is rather
late for them to erect canneries of their
own. As for dried cherries he said the
exchange handled between two and three
tons a year at the following prices:
Pitted Royal Ann, 15 to 16 cents per
pound net; unpitted, 5 cents for black and
< cents for white. Apricot-growers fear
nothing, as most of this fruit is dried.
Prime apricots have been sold for T 1^
cents per pound, but he doubted if they
could be bought now for less than 8 or
i) cents.
Ap Opposing Combine Will
Prove the Salvation of
the Growers.
SACRAMENTO. June 1.â Mrs. E. M.
Shields, one of the most progressive
fruit growers in Sacramento County
and a leading exhibitor at the State
Fairs, sells <iuite extensively to canneries.
She has been reading The Call's reports
cf the efforts of the Alameda County
growers to protect themselves against the
car.nery trust and has reached the conclu
sion that the only salvation cf the grow
ers cf cannery fruit in this section lies In
a -combine, on lines similar to those of the
Alameda growers. Mrs. Shields is not at
all convinced that the cannery trust is a
boon to the growers, although its pro
moters held out that cheerful promise to
th< m.
.^aid Mrs. Shields in conversation with
the correspondent of The Call: "borne ten
years sigo on the assurance of the can
i..ry ptoplo that they would take all my

peaches that were the exact thing- for

If the combine will not give them a fair
price for their fruit, they can fry Kami
take chances on the dried fruit market.
The combine of the packers must be met
by the growers with a similar organiza
tion and the growers of Kings County
stand ready at all times to co-operate
with the growers of other parts of the
State. The success of the California Rai
sin Growers' Association shows what
can be accomplished in that line. I am
glad that The Call is agitating this mat
tC N. W. Motherall â Dry your fruit.
That is the solution of the whole
Jroblem. When we do this It wi force
the canners to pay us what our fruit will
bring if dried, with the labor off. Of
course this is not possible in some por
tions of the State, but if the srowers
there cannot get a living price for their
fruit, let them put up their own canner
ies and refuse to sell to the combine.
This will bring the canners to time.
VENTURA.
Squeeze by the Combine
Would Mean Growers'
Bankruptcy.
VISAX.IA. June 1.â Regarding the al
leged threatened combination of
canners to keep down the prices of
fruit, Mayor C. J. Berry, one of the
most extensive growers In the San Joa-
quin, Valley, has this to say:
"I do not think and can hardly, believe
the intention of the cannery trust is to
squeeze the fruit-grower down to prices
for his fruit which would mean bank
ruptcy. Business men are generally
very clear-headed about their affairs,
and no one will deny that the managers
of the cannery combine are about as an
up-to-date association of business peo
ple as exists anywhere in our State.
Farmers sometimes imagine they are
going to run the whole universe, partic
ularly in their special line of produc
tion. They are apt to forget that it is the
customer who makes the prices of an
article of food. If the pack of cherries
and apricots last season was in excess of
the demand, as I am reliably informed
was the case, then with the present im
mense fruit crop promised all over the
United States it would be a great deter
rent for the cannery combine to buy in
any large way or at very liberal prices.
The shippers are here making contracts
for our fresh fruits, and while prices of
fered are not as good as they gave last
year, yet the prices being paid are net
bad. It is a pretty hard thing to do to
combine for prices among the fruit-grow
ers with such a perishable article as
fruit."
Growers Are Not Concerning
Themselves (3bout the
Combine.
CHICO. June Lâ In talking with the
various fruit growers and dealers In
this section your correspondent finds
that the general sentiment regarding
the outlook for prices on canning fruits is
about as follows: So far as the cannery
combine is concerned there is no evidence
of its having affected this section. Al
ready fruit buyers are contracting for
crops on the tree at prices equal and in
some instances better than those paid last
year, peaches in this section always com
manding higli prices. Apricots will be a
little lower than last year on account of
the crop having been damaged to some ex-
tent. There is an abundance of Bartlett
pears, which will bring a good, round tig
ure. The cannery has bc-en running for
three weeks on cherries, for which a fair
price was paidâ as good as could have
been expected, considering the damage by
the recent rains. Fruit growers have so
far paid but little attention to the fact
that the leading canneries of this State
had combined, owing to the fact that they
have already been offered good prices for
their crop and can sell at any time.

cannery sufficiently largre to handle ail the

pleased with The Call's editorial on this
subject and said the articie expressed his
sentiments exactly and thought it would
have a good effect.
This is the general sentiment of the fruit
growers of this section, and wÂ© do not
doubt but some deHnite action will be
taken in this regard.

community canneries, conducted in such
a manner that no individual grower

SACRAMENTO, Mrs. E. M. Shield^ â The only way would be^or us to get together
and take stock in a cannery of our own.
VISALIA, Major C. J. Berry â I do not think and can hardly believe, the intention of
the cannery trust is to squeeze the fruit-grower down to prices foi^ his fruit which would
mean bankruptcy.
SONOMA, Hon. Robert Howeâ This year the fruit-growers are completely at the
mercy of the canners' combination, but before next season's crop is ready for harvesting we
can organize, build and equip a co-operative cannery sufficiently large to handle all the fruit of
MARYSVILLE, W. H. Raub â I would favor the establishment of community can
neries, conducted in such a manner that no individual grower should acquire a controlling
interest; pack our fruit in first-class shape, and I believe we would have no trouble in finding a
ready market.
YUBA CITY, L. A. Waltonrâ A combine of the growers in localities that produce
largely one or two varieties of fruit, as a combine of the cherry-growers of Alameda or the
peach-growers of Sutter, would be the proper course to pursue and would maintain prices at
the canneries.
VENTURA â A. Everett favors a State organization of fruit-growers to fight the
cannery trust.
NAPA, -W. M. Fisher â The San Leandro fruit-growers have done a wise thing in
forming a combine against the cannery men. The fruit-growers should stand together and
get all they can for their fruit.

Ccnners' Combin2 Will Not
flffect This County's
Growers
VCAVTIXE. June 1.â Tour corre-
Fpor.dent has interviewed the most
prominent growers relative to the
combination of fruit canncrs to con
trol the price cf fruit. They state that
the canners have not been in this market
for the paM three years. All our fruit
is shipped Eai-t green, and what is too
ripe is dried. Th*y are not affected by
tuny action taken by canners.
Various Methods Proposed to
Bring the Congers to
Time.
HANFORD. June 1.â C. V. Parker-
Organize. Meet organization with
organization. Until the farmers
get poor enough to stand together
and trust each other, like men, it will
go from bad to worse, as our raisin busi
ness d!d. There is only one solution to
the problem, and that is to stand to
gether like men. If the growers of Kings
County do not receive a fair price tor
their green fruit they can dry it and
take cnances on the dried fruit market.
A. M. Stone â Dry our poaches and
apricots and other fruits. The canners
must have fruit to conduct their busi
ness, and if they see that the grower is
going to dry his fruit in preference to
Hellinj it to the cannery below a fair
living price, the cannery people will nec
essarily have to raise their price or get
no fruit.
\V. H. Campâ I have not given this
question much thought, but It would ap
pear to me that if the grower would dry
hls fruit he would be able to dictate his
price. The growers of Kings County
have seen the benefits of organization,
and if they will just stand together they
can demand what they want and get it.

NEW OFFICERS OF
THE PATRIARCHS
H. O. Brower Elected Briga
dier General of Militant
Odd Fellows.
The permission given by the Health
Board to Dr. E. S., Pillsbury to attend
suspecte* cases of plague in Chinatown
and also to assist at autopsies and bac
teriological examinations was rescinded at
yesterday's meeting. A letter from Dr.
Pillsbury published in The Call of March
12, 1900, in which he denied the existence
of bubonic plague in San Francisco was
read. Dr. Bazet said that he believed
Pillsbury was prejudiced -against the
Board of Health and was disgruntled on
account of not obtaining the position of
bacteriologist, for which he had applied.
Dr. Pillsbury, in an interview with Dr.
Bazet, stated that Dr. Kellogg was not
a graduated bacteriologist, whereupon
Dr. Bazet wrote to Dr. Jordan of the
Stanford University and received a reply
that Dr. Kellogg had passed in bacteri
ology at the university. Dr. Bazet moved
thai Dr. Pillsbury be not admitted to the
CitF Laboratory and that Drs. Hodghead
and Powers also be, excluded, which mo*
tion was carried.
Health Officer O'Brien was directed to
send a communication to the attorneys for
the Chinese Six Compifhles advising them
that all action heretofore taken by the
board relative to the permission given
their representatives to appear at future
post-mortem examinations and bacterio
logical investigations had been rescinded.
The communication continues:
"This board will bo pleased to receive
suggestions from you as to the appoint
ment of some one representative of your
clients of approved medical standing to
act for them in the matter hereinabove
adverted to. The conditions require that
vour suggestions shall be made in writing
nnd delivered to the Health Office at least
six hours prior to the meeting of the
board at which you may desire that ac
tion shall be taken, and further that you
will not nominate as representative either
K. S. Pillsbury, M. D., or D. A. Hodg

who, for' reasons which are satisfactory
to the board but which need not be de
tailed here, are not acceptable."
Dr. Buckley introduced the following
resolution, which was adopted: 1
Resolved, That ' it be the sense of this board
that all physicians to whom permits are issued
must beTore entering* the quarantined district
furnish the names and addresses of the patients
whom theÂ» there intend to visit and milst com
ply with <01 the quarantine regulations adopted
by this board. Further, they must be accom
panied by a health inspector.
Dr. McCarthy called the attention of the
board to the fact that it had been sug
gested .by the attorney of the Chinese Six
Compahies that it would cost 23 cents per
day per man to feed the indigents in
Chinatown. He said that at the City and
County Â¦ Hospital and Almshouse- it cost
but a little over 8 cents per day per man,
and he thought that the indigents in
Chinatown could be supported for the
same amount, but that* it could not be
done successfully in that district and ad
vised the establishment of a detention
hospital to which these people could be
movCti.and cared for.
The matter was referred to the Com
mittee on. Detention Camps, consisting of
Drs. Buckley, McCarthy and Chief Sulli
van. The Quarantine Committee will con
sist of the same members. \
A telegram from Senator Perkins in an
swer to one sent by Mayor Phelan was
read as follows::
WASHINGTON. D. C. June 2, 1300.
Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor. San Fran-
Cisco, Cal. : Secretary of War has wired Gen
eral Shatter to place at disposal authorities
San Francisco such parf of Angel Island as
may be necessary for quarantine detention pur
poses. Surgeon General Wyman recommends
Board of Health consult with Dr. Kinyoun be
fore taking final action, as Government quar
antine station is on the island. - -
GEORGE C. PERKINS.
It was resolved that all persons disobey
ing the orders of the board in any man
ner hampering or Interfering *flth the
health officers in their efforts tOjtfnforce
the regulations, should be denieufpermits
to enter the quarantined district, and
should in the discretion of the board be
further summarily dealt with according
to law. â¢
It was decided that until further orders
no permits would be issued to enter
Chinatown unless it was absolutely neces
sary. . .
J. F. Derham was appointed clerk in
the health office at a salary of $100 a
month and Thomas Drady to succeed A.
D. Turner as day policeman at the Alms
house.
The petition of the Pacific Fruit Pack
ing Company for a modification of the
lines of quarantine so that it may be per
mitted to carry on its business on Stock
ton street was referred to Chief Sullivan
and JDr. Buckley with full power to act.
The board adjourned to meet at 4:30

Sandcn himself is not in San Francis-
co and never has been. I bought his
Belts, but without tending myself as_ to
selling price, and now I'm almost Riving
'em away. I ask no deposit and balance
when cured: but will, on a $5000 bond,
sell you his real, bona-fide, highest
power $40 belt for $20.00, or his $20
belt for $10.00. There's no imitation,
no fantastic models. Call on me and I
will fit you with the genuine U. S. pat-
ented Sanden Belt at half-price, heed*
less of the winnings and warnings of
those who would filch you out of dou-
ble the amount for their trash. It's all
I can do to mind my own business. I'm
j not troubled about those who've never
had a medical diploma, who may be only
typewriters or transitory agents with no
responsibility and incapable of diagnos-
ing and treating your case. .What can
you expect from such people?

*A POPULAR MISTAKE
\ _ -Â¦--Â¦'Â¦;-Â¦."
Regarding Remedies for Dyspepsia
and Indigestion.
The national disease of Americans Is in-
digestion, or in its chronic form, dyspep-
sia, and for the very reason that it Is so
common many people neglect taking
proper treatment for what they consider
trifling stomach trouble, when as a mat-
ter of fact Indigestion lays the foundation
for many incurable diseases. Xo person
with a vigorous, healthy stomach will fall
a victim to consumption. Many kidney
diseases and heart troubles date their be-
ginning from poor digestion; thin, nervous
people are really so because their stom-
achs are out of gear; weary, languid,
faded out âomen owe their condition to
imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you meet is
afflicted with weak digestion it is not sur-
prising that nearly every secret patent
medicine on the market claims to be a
cure for dyspepsia, as well as a score of
<ither troubles, when, in fact, as Dr.
"Worthier says, there is but one genuine
dyspepsia cure which is perfectly safe and
reliable, and, moreover, this remedy is not
a patent medicine, but it is a scientific
combination of pure pepsin '(free from ani-
mal matter), vegetable essences, fruit
salts and bismuth. It is sold by druggists
under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. No extravagant claims are made
for them, but for indigestion or any stom-
ach trouble Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are far ahead Cf any remedy yet discov-
ered. They act on the food eaten; no
dieting is necessary; simply eat all tho
wholesome food you want, and .hese tab
Jets will digest it. A cure results, because-
all the stomach needs Is a rest, which
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give by doing
the work of digestion. t .

Information has been received from Se
attle to the effect that the passengersi on
the Charles D. Lane were dissatisfied with
the treatment accorded them by the man
agers of the outfit and had instituted pro
ceedings for. the return of their money.
According to the ; Ktatement made by one
of the passengers, a party of tifty banded
together, , engaged a lawyer, brought
Lane. Conklin and Duffin up to his otlice
and demanded their money back. Their
plaint was that the agent had sold them
first-class tickets en the vessel and was
striving -to furnish them with steerage
accommodations. It is further stated, that
Mr. Lane became disgusted with' the
whole outfit and promptly complied with
their demand for the return of their
money. He ordered his clerk to hand to
each member of the complaining party
$110, the sum each had expended for a
ticket. He also announced to the passen
gers on the boat that if any more of them
were dissatisfied with the treatment ac
corded them he would gladly refund the
money they had paid for tickets. A num
ber of "kickers" took advantage of the
offer and received their money back.

211 passengers, and the Alaska Commer
cial Company's San Jose from Freaiont
street wharf at 2:ZJ p. m. with 130 passen

There was some excitement at Freniont

out. Ex-Coroner Kd K. H:ll had a passage
secured on the vessel, but he only reachira
the wharf when the steamer was twenty
yards away. He yelled to Captain Brown
to come back for him, tut the skipper
. or.ly smiled and shook his head. Tnen ur.
Hill yelled that he would catch them oft
Meigg's wharf if they would stop for him,
and when Pilot Read ehouted "Hurry

a gallop for North Beach. While the San

The steamer Mariposa brings the news
from Australia of the total loss of the
German ship Undine. The vessel was well
known on th-3- coast and left Salina Cruz,
Mexico, with a cargo of mahogany and
cedar logs for England on December 8
last. Nothing definite was heard from her
until the â¢ British ship Oakhurst reached
Port Adelaide, Australia, with the news
that the ship had foundered at sea in lat
itude 30 19 south, longitude 25 36 west. The
Undine was caught In a terrific storm and
labored heavily. -Suddenly she sprang a
leak and the water gained so fast that the
crew had to leave her in a hurry- The
men, sixteen all told, escaped In two boats
and had a terrible time of it. During a
squall the boats separated, and when the
one with the captain, second mate and six
men In it was picked up by the Oakhurst
they were nearly dead from exhaustion;
Later they were put aboard the British
transport Joruoa and taken to Cape Town.
Nothing positive is known of the fate of
the other eight men, but the bark Sita
signaled the Dark Loch Rannoch on April
6 ttiat they had picked up a boat's crew
of a German ship, name unknown. The
Sita is bound from England to Brisbane,
Australia.
Tne Undine was a small ship of 726 tons
net burden. She was 'built In 1S67 and was
owned in Hamburg.
Newsboy Sails Monday.
The steamer Newsboy was to have
sailed for Nome yesterday, but the finish
ing touches have yet to De put to her al
terations, so she will not be ready to leave
until Monday night. She has been put in
tlrst class shape, and the detention is due
to the extra work being done on Â»he cabin
accommodations. She will take away
about 100 passengers and thirty- head of
horses. She is full of freight, among
which is the balance of the Valencia's
cargo and some stuff left behind by the
Coal From the North.
Five coal vessels carrying about 13,000
tons of black diamonds made port yester
day. The ship Occidental with 2525 tons,
ship Berlin with 2340 tons, ship Spartan

ni^ht or early Monday morning. General
Otis is living ashore in Dr. Kinyoun's
quarters on tho Island, but will come to
the city just as soon as the transport Is

The Meade will be released from quar
antine Monday morning and the Mariposa

AL. WIELAXD went sailing on Deco

F. W. Dohrmann. president of the Mer
chants' Association, has written a letter
of defiance to Attorney J. E. O'Donnell
The lawyer, at the last meeting of
the Board of Supervisors*, made charges
to the effect that the merchant was heav
ily Interested In the City Street Improve
ment Company. This corporation owns,
O'Donnell alleged, the only sprinkling
wagons in this city that conform to the
order of the board designating what style
of wagons fhall be u?ed In sprinkling the
city's streets. The letter from Mr. Dohr
xnann, which is of a sizzling nature and
demands gome sort of a reply from the
attorney. Is as follows:
SAN FKANCISCO, June 2. 1300.
Mr. J. E. O'Donnell, Cityâ Sir: The daily
n&.j*T6 rejjort that beiore the Hoard of Super
visors, and when I was not present, you made
the following ciiarse, refuting, when requested
by the Mayor to do bo, to give your authority:
"Mr. Uoiirmann owns a principal Interest in
the City Street Improvement Company, which
â¢/wns the only cart* allowed to be used under
the existing: order, and Jt was by Â»the ma
chination of that company that the contract
v as made." . Â¦'Â¦Â¦-"Â¦ .'."
It was not my Intention to notice these
ci.arpes until several members of the Mer
chants' Association, of which 1 have the honor
to be president, and on whose behalf I have
lx*n active In regard to street sprinkling, rep
rcÂ«Â«nted to me that wh!!Â» the absurdity of your
Matements would be easily recognized by those
who -'knew of the circumstances, there would
\>r many others who might be misled through
your ttatf-raf-nts if they remain unchallenged.
I now call m>on you to produce proof of the
cl-iai-frs that 1 am or have been directly or ln
<Jireotly financially interested In the City Street
Improvement or any other company having con-'
tract* with the municipal government, a*id If
you can prove your < harge I will hand over
JlOfiO to the fund now lx-'.ng raised to assUt the
Hoard of Health. /
As to the' charge that carts allowed to be
ured under, the Kprinklins contract art con
trolled by ftie City Improvement Company. I
refer you to FtudM>aluÂ»r Brothers on Market
ptrret, who- have tl,--.- carte ror eale to any
body who wtehep to buy them, and who kindly
loaned them to the Merchants' Association for
thÂ«> purpose of Â«-xj*>rimc.it!ng as to the best
methods of rprlnklin*r the streets.
If you are unable to produce i*-, proof* called
for I shall expect you to acknowledge jiubllcly
t-hat you have' tÂ»*en misinformed In rr-eard to
farts and have made, statements which are not
correct. If you car.r.ct prove them and will
nofYnake acknowledgment' of your error, the
ratt:ral inference will be that you have will
fully and maliciously ulvon expressions to

No one seems to know how the fire
started. Oppenheimer. who Is a pawn
broker on Grant avenue, and his family
wore away at the time and neighbors
turned in an alarm when they saw tlames
shooting from the roof of the building.
In a short .time the blaze lighted up the
surrounding country and the bay.
Thousands of people congregated on the
bluffs and narrow streets above and
watched the elements of destruction at
their work. From the bay and water front
the sight was particularly spectacular, it
appearing as If an Immense sheet of flame
was shooting out of the ridge of Tele
graph Hill.
The fire had almost consumed the entire
building before the horses laboring up the
steep hilld could draw the apparatus close
enough to be of any service. Two fire
menâ Harry Wilson of Truck 2 and John
Smith of Truck 1â were struck by falling
debris and had to be carried from the
scene. Both quickly recovered. The total
loss on the two dwellings will approxi
mate $2000.
One of the most spectacular fires seen in
San Francisco in some time destroyed the
residence of G. Oppenheimer, 1402 Mont
gomery street, last evening- The building
was located near the summit of Telegraph
Hill and the rear portion of It was sup
ported on tall piles. Much difficulty was
experienced by the Fire Department in
reaching the pcene and before a stream of
water could be brought to play on the
flames, the Oppenheimer residence was a
mass of ruins and the dwelling of J.
Lenox adjoining was badly gutted.

During the session there will be Intro

of the ritual, which many of the mem
bers believe is too long. A strong fiffht.
it is said, will bo made to preserve it in
its present condition, as . the several
charges which are expressed 'in most elo
quent language portray the aims and the
principles of the order in a manner that
cannot be improved upon.
An effort will be made to establish a
Native Daughters' scholarship at the Uni
versity of California.
San Luis Obispo will make a bid for the
Gra/id Parlor session of 1901, and 'there
may be other cities that want the honor
of having that grand body, but as yet
they have not been heard from. A propo
sition will, bo presented. to have ajsession
of the Grand Parlor at some "time within
the next five' years In the Yosemlte Val
ley, as It is believed by the promoters of
that idea that the members of the grand
body will be Inspired by meeting In that
grand wonder of California as delegates
never before have been inspired.
Mrs. Cora B. Sifford will become the
past grand president, and she will be suc
ceeded as grand president by Mrs. Emma
Gett of Califla Parlor of Sacramento, who
now holds the position of grand vice presi
dent. For the latter office there will be
more than one candidate. Those who have
been named are Mrs. Ella Caminetti of
Ursula Parlor. Mrs. Genevieve Baker of
Buena A r ista Parlor and Miss Eliza D.
Keith of Alta Parlor. The last named Is
at present grand treasurer. For some time
past the contest was between the first two
named, but it is asserted that Miss Keith
has been Induced to allow her name to be
used. Grass Valley wants the grand mar
shalship for one of its delegates, and it Is
said that Mrs. Allslm F. Watt of Manza
nlta Parlor of that city will be placed In
nomination. For the office of grand sec
retary the friends of the incumbent. Mrs.
GeorjHe â¢ .C. Ryan; will urge her to
be. a .candidate again. Others who
are named for thl f s very Important office
are- Miss Laura J. Frakes of Amapola
Parlor. Sutter Creek, at present grand
marshal. The name of Miss Harriett E.
Lee of Woodland Parlor, one of the grand
trustees, lias been mentioned, but there is
no certainty that the lady will be a candi
date. Miss Lizzie Douglass of Alta Par
lor No. 3 of this city will be named for
grand treasurer. unless there should be a
change by the time nominations are made,
and she will then be named for another
offlce. There will be a number of candi
dates for the other offices, but there are
so many for these that no one Is willing to
make a guess as to possible successful
ones.
The members of Ursula Paricr, the pio

justice.' "

Tom O'Brien, labor agitator, politician
and ex-clerk of the Police Court, was ar
rested last night and charged with dis
turbing the peace. O'Brien attended a
meeting of the Boer sympathizers at Met

a position on the Mint steps he started to
harangue a small crowd which had col
lected on what he termed "British Atroci
ties in South Africa."

li/TlSS ROSE HOLLAND, "the szueet pea girl" of the Dur-
J_ rJL rant murder trial, is a victim of Hie gold fever. Yesterday
when the steamer San Jose pulled out for the Nome gold
fields "the szveet pea girl" rvas among the most excited passengers on
her deck. That she is a woman of im pulses has long since been dem
onstrated, but whether or not a nature zvith this as its strongest
characteristics zvill win in the battle for gold remains to be seen.
She says she has confidence in her luck, however, and none who
heard her questioned her belief that Dame Fortune would favor
her in her pursuit for riches.
Miss Holland is prone to thrust fame upon herself. A jew
years ago, when all San Francisco zvas horrified at the discovery
of the dead bodies of Blanche Lamont and Minnie Williams in
Emanucl Baptist Church and- appalled when it learned that Dur
rant was the murderer, she became widely if not enviably known.
When mothers drew"' their children around them and younger women
shrank at the very mention of the name of the fiend of the belfry,
Miss Holland went forth to comfort the criminal. Each day found
her in court with a handful of fragrant violets, her token of confi
dence for Durrani, the murderer. So much mystery attached to her
friendship for him that it zvas rumored that it zvas none other than
she zvho zvas bearing the great expense of his trial. This, she
firmly denied throughout, hozvevcr, and zvhether her interest in the
murderer zvas simply caprice or othcrzvisc zvill probably never be
known.
After Durrani's execution she once again- merged into obscur
ity, but now the eyes of the zvorld â at least this portion thereof â
are again upon her and zvill zvatch with interest her fight for fortune
in the land of the midnight sun.

CHICAGO. June 2.â The people who
\\<ti* lucky onrngh to go to the in
tercollegiate jra:nes to-day witnessed
the closest cos ttest ever known in
rollope athletics. It was anybody's
victory p ven to -the last race, which
decio>d the day. Tljria was the 220-yard
hurdl<Â». and California had Woolsey in it.
McCIaln of Michigan e*nd Woolpvey of Cali
fornia ran together Until tlxe last hurdle.
when Wfkolsey. in Ifis zenl to win. took
too long a stride and, lop t his stop. Before
h* rould recover it two riim had pa.Â«<v<l
him and he cajne in a eltwe third. If he
had even made second place California
would have wont the meet.
California led in points nil through the
meet. It would have been an easy thing
for us'Jf Hoffmrtn had been able to corn
pet* 1 , as the higb jump was won at five
feet nine inches end second place in the
pole vault at ton .feet three imhps. Hoff
man c uld have vron both apd tha? would
have made elgrht :oorÂ« points for Califor
nia. Hoffman sh<rwed his grit and made
an attempt to jump, tratr-alas! his split
muscle gave way, and he had to be helped
en the field. ...
The California boys to-night are the
most disabled lot Â«of athletes I have ever
teen. It was our last meâ¬t. and we went
into it not caring how long we would be
laid up after rt. "When we began there

Many Surprises During the Contests
on Ravenswood Field.-
FOUR RECORDS BROKEN.
CHICAGO. June 2.â The Western inter
collegiate athletic championship was won
by tb.e University of Michigan track and
field team at Ravenswood Field to-day,
after the most closely contested meet in Â¦
the history of the association. There was
only a half point difference between the
total scores of Michigan and Chicago :
when the last event had been "decided,
with California but 1Â»Â£ points behind Chi
cago, and it took the last eventâ the 120
yard hurdle, in which athletes of those
three institutions fought for supremacyâ
to decide the championship.
Teams from nineteen Western colleges
and universities competed in the sixteen
track and field events carded, and though
the cindersjiaths were anything but fast
and a cold north wind" put the thinly clad
university athletes at a disadvantage yet
four Western intercollegiate records were
broken, including one track and three
field events. Jn one of those big Plaw the
Californian. who recently in the East on
a Private trial broke the world's reco?rt
for the hammer throw, easily established
new Western records for the hammer
throw and shot put. Dvoorak of Michi
gan established a new record in the nol
vault, and Bredsteen, without "belnl
pressed, clipped five seconds off the mHo
walk record. In the other track "veâ¢ to i
however, the time was slow cnlR>

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 2.â Ten thousand
people saw the racing at the Fair Grounda
to-day, i The main interest centered in the
Club'Members' handicap, which, next to
the 'Derby, is the largest classic event of
the local meeting. Four of the best horses
at I the track | met in the contest for j the
$2500 prize. The running of this event wit
nessed the peculiar spectacle of two rank
outsider's administering a good beating to
two first-class stake horses. Sam Phillips
was installed favorite at 3 to 5 and the
publiC'inade a tremendous plunge on him
at these odds. Pink Coat was made sec
ond choice and received a strong play,
but Pinochle and Found had few sup

; Found set a fast pace from start to

NEW YORK; June Â£â Upsets wereTthe
ruleuD to the Ethelbert-Jean Bereaud
NEW YORK, June 2.â Ethelbert eas
ily defeated Jean Bereaud in the
special race at Gravesend to-day.
He was ridden by Danny Maher
and was favorite in the betting.
The time was 2:0S 1-5 for the mile
and a quarter. His performance was good
enough to beat that of any horse that was
ever saddled in this country. Maher had
waiting orders and laid alongside his rival
'until they were a half-mile from home,
when he drew out and opened a big gap
In a few strides and then came on as he
pleased, under double wraps; with his
head sideways, ten lengths in front.
The horses went up to the post amid
thunders of applause, for everybody rec
ognized that the best four-year-olds in
training were about to measure strides to
decide the championship, and when it was
all over there was no question or doubt.
Slowly they cantered to the post, arriving
there a minute later and getting away on
the instant. Waiting on Jean Bereaud
was no mean task, for the pace was hot.
The first quarter was covered in 23 4-3 sec
ondsânot slow going when the weight is
considered. Like a pair fastened head and
tail they raced to the five furlongs pole.
St was a great fight.' Neither had the
breadth of a hair of advantage over the
other, and in spite of the fact that the
furlong was run in 11 3-5 seconds they ap
peared to be going well within themselves.
When they, were straightened out in the
backstretch they were still running stride
for stride, neither appearing to have the
least advantage, and the half was passed
in 48 seconds.
Speed there had been in plenty, but more
was to come. The red and white pole was
at" hand, and in an instant, they had
passed it in 1:00 2-5â splendid time. In the
next furlong it became apparent that Jean
Bereaud had not the gad. as, inch by inch
at first and then foot by foot and then
stride hy stride, EthelbCFt began to get
away from his rival. The time to the
three-quarters was l:13Vz. and a3 far as
Jean Bereaud was concerned he had little
more interest in the race. Around the up
per turn to the stretch it was Ethelbert
first and the other nowhere, for in a few
bounds, with. Maher sitting still on his
back, he had opened a gap of a dozen
lengths, while Jean Bereaud was flounder
ing in distress, a badly beaten horse.
Maher did not look back, however, until
he had reached the end of the seven fur
longs, in 1:26 3-5, and when he did turn he
saw the pride of the Whitney string be
hind him and took a steadying pull on his
mount, passing the mile pole in 1:41 1-5;
with a couple of wraps in his hands and
lots left in his mount. Down the stretch
It was only a procession. Ethelbert's head
was pulled sideways and Maher was try
ing his best to pull him up. Pull as hard
as he might, however, he could not help
winning by ten lengths, amid the cheers
of the multitude.

CINCIIS^ATI, June 2.â Paddy Tomlin
son made \o mistake when he brought his
pood filly Queen Dixon here from St.
Louis to run in the Clip?etta stakes at
Latonla to-day. Queen Dixon was far the
best-rrr-a field of eight two-year-old fillies
and won in a canter. The distance was
five furlongs, but on account of the
wretched condition of the tracS: the time
was very slow. Queen Dixon was sent

The mile handicap furnished the most
exciting finish of the day. Salvarse and

gan won his heats in a walk and he had
nothing to bother him in the final.
In the 220 yards, both Cadogan and
Drum had an easy thing of it in their
heats and both were, of course, pitted
against one another in the final. Cadogan
! won the race easily, while Drum got a
| poor start, and we did not think our
: worthy captain was going to get a place;
I but at the 50-yard mark he made a won
derful ppurt and passed every one save
his running mate.
Drum was our only entry in the quarter
mile. After they had run about 20 yards
a man in front of him fell and, with our
luck, our captain fell over him, but he
gathered himself and started after the
Lunch. Before they had run 150 yards he
closed up a gap of at least 20 yards, but.
Feeing that he could not win. he stopped
to save himself for the 220 yards. He un
] doubtedly would have won had he not met
this accident. He was spiked in a couple
of places on his legs and sharp clndors
ground into his legs, arms and shoulder.
In the half mile. Service was running a
fine race, when one of the contestants
jostled him. and.the inspector, who is a
good example of the kind of officials they
have hero in the Middle West, disqualified
him for fouling the other man.
The mile was a fast one and our men
did not stand a, chance, but both. Service
and Aloser ran a sritty race.
Mile Walk Was a Run.
The mile walk was more like a mile run
for the first two laps than a l heel-and-toe
event. If the race had been held in Cali
fornia every one of the contestants would
havo been ruled out in the first lap, in
cluding the California man. As it was
two men were disqualified and Walsh fin
ished third. ~~
The bicycle races did not Interest us,
as we did not have any entry. They only
interestt-d us in that Notre Dame Col
lege won them and therefore took points
from our rival university, Chicago, which
was counting on first place in both race?.
Broughton got only third in the broad
jump. He got his take oft all right, but
fild not have enough speed to jump out.
His trial jump wap 20 feet 11 inches,, which
qualified him for the finals, but he could
jump only 21 feet in the finals.
When the shot put came we rolled up
eight points. Both Plaw and Wooisey
cloarlv outclassed their rivals and both
broke the Western intercollegiate record.
Wooisey was ahead until the last put,
when our old stand-by, Plaw. boosted the
lead pnhere out to 41 feet 11 inches and
won.
Th<Â» hammer throw was an easy thin?
for Plaw. who did not exert himself very
much and threw it 15G feet. Although the
spectators cheered him they were rather
disappointed because he did not put the
Western intercollegiate mark above that
of the Eastern intercollegiate. The husky
Californian was tired from his other event
and did not try very hard. Plaw thought
he would try throwing the discus and
made a throw of 100 feet, but did not get
a place. -With little practice he could
teach the Easterners a little about this
event.

Oakland 12, Sacramento 2.
The "champs" made a beautiful dish of
every kind of lobster known to Rourmets
or. baseban ' men r when "they faced the
Dudes yesterday aCternoon at Recreation
Park.. Mr. Doyle's curves were uncurled
for a homer.by Hcntchinson and so many
doubles and singles. that there was" hardly
ppace on the. 1 card for their Inscription.
As for the errors a. corps of bookkeepers
were : necessary for their tabulation.
The score shows 'how Sacramento went
to pieces and played such unmentionable
ball. It was like the weather-cold and
bad to have near you.
The firewoiks show was called at the
outset of tha game. Sacramento had
come and- go^e when the Dudes were
given their first chance with the stick,
and' before' they, took -the field four hits
and as many runs were registered. It was
nothing: but a' deal of hits on the part of
the Dudes' and 'errors by the "champs."
Pchmeer was safe on Hanlon's error, go
ins to second on Hammond's single and
scoring on Hutchinson's double. â¢ Ham
mond tried to step on the rubbor on this
play, but died at hom(>-=i) TTmpire Graves
said. A single by Moskiman scored
Hutchinson, but Moskiman perished go
inp.to thn middle station. An error by
Eaeran.put Fraroks Into the running and
a fumblPi by Doveraux did as much for
Dunleavy, both' men scorinp on a double
by Xanse. who was caiiRht attempting- to
make 'three ba-'es out of a two-batfger.
â¢In the ; fifth Brxyle was pimply slaugh
tered for a homer and. a couple of doubles,
Hutchinson and Moskiman crossing the
plate.'
The first'run for the "champs" came in
the sixth. 'Bi^rran walked to first, stole
pocond and jogged homo on Hughos' rton
ble.Hughes advancing a station on Stan
ley's hit to left and scoring on Stanley's
out in an attempt to steal second. With
two men undmr the sod in this inninp-.on
account of a. series of bad blunders and a
hit.. Hamilton and Hutchinson scored. '

to Mayor Phelan. The Mayor will cast his eye over the figures and note the
changes In the allowances made to the various departments, and the levy

the committee has reduced the allowances by $250,000, being the taxes on that
amount. To do this reductions have been made in various items. The extra clerks
originally allowed the Assessor. Recorder and Treasurer, besides several other ex
tra employes have be,en eliminated entirely, effecting a reduction of $19,620. The Board -
of Public Works' allowance was reduced by $190,020. Including $10,000 for Trocadero
Gulch and $50,000 for paving streets In the north central district The com
mittee, however, made a reallowance of $30,794 for the latter purpose.

to pay protested taxes paid by banks and other corporations on bonds,~ amount- â¢
ing to $66,784 2L

For some unexplained reason the shrewd
bettors at Union Coursing Park yesterday
were all at sea. They Installed a number
of greyhounds favorites at false prices
and did not appreciate their mistake until
the courses were run, and their tickets did
not match the color ot the signal dis
played by the flag steward. Rude Awak

the trouble bv winning from Snapshot at

seems fit to run in any company. For
Glory is on edge, and imported Rural Ar

also showing speed. The detailed results

OAKLAND. June 2.â Trowbridge H.
Ward, Clerk of the Supreme Court
of California for the term which
ended January 1, last year, died
suddenly to-day from heart disease at
Laytonvllle. Mendocino County. News of
Mr. Ward's death reached his family In
Oakland through a brief telegram sent to
his son. William Ward, by Frank Free
man of this city, a member of the sur
veying party of which Mr. Ward was in
charge.
The Information came as a startling
shock to the family, as Mr. Ward had left
home on the trip two weeks ago In appar
ently the best of health. He had intended
Police Officer John Phelan of the
Southern station had his left leg ampu
tated at the ankle shortly before 1 o'clock
this morning 1 in a collision between extra
accommodation car 901 of the Market
street system and a car of the Sutter
street road at the corner of Ellis and Lar
kin streets. The accident occurred with
startling suddenness, and but for the fact
that the unfortunate policeman was tho
only passenger riding on the dummy, oth
ers'fnight have been injured or killed.
The accommodation car was coming in
from the Cliff House with a large crowd
of guests and members of the "Bolo"
Club. The car was in charge of Motor
man William Leland and Conductor
Sterns. When it reached the corner of
Ellis and Larkin streets it was moving at
a good speed. Leland saw the Larkin
fitreet car crossing his path and endeav
ored to bring his car to a standstill. He
might have succeeded but for the fact
that the rails were slippery. The heavy
car did not respond readily to the brakes,
and the impetus it had gained carried
it with some force against the dummy of
the cable car. Phelan, who. on seeing his
danger, attempted to seek a place of
safety, was caught between the cars and
his foot badly crushed. "***
Very little damage was done to either
car. The dummy was thrown partly Â»ff
the track and the sent Phelan had occu
pied was partly wrecked.
The officer was hurried to the Receiv
ing Hospital and his injuries ascertained.
Dr. Burnette found that the left foot had
been mashed below the ankle and that It
would be necessary to amputate the limb
below the knee to save the policeman's
life. He said Phelan was In- a critical con
dition, but did not apprehend any fatal
result from the use of the knife.
Officer Phelan had reported oft duty a
half hour previouslv and was on his way
to his home at 730 .Ellis street, which was
but a short distance from the scene of
the collision. He is unmarried. He has
been a member of the police force for
years and up to two months ago his beat
was on the north side of Market street,
between Fourth and New Montgomery.
He is well known and has many friends.
The Sutter-street car was in charge of
Gripman Cteden and Conductor Giles. Ac
cording to their statements they had the
right of way. and had anticipated no
danger of collision. At an early hour thia
morning Motorman Leland and Conductor
Sterns surrendered at the Southern police
station and were placed on the "detinue"
book pending the result of Phelan's in
juries.

Some good coursing was had In the run
down of the open stake at Ingleside

were generally cf the short order, though
relief dogs were turned loose in two
events.

good odds. Lady Claire was beaten by
October Woodcock at 4 to 1 in a long,
hard run. Lady was not up to her usual
forxa and her opponent gave her a trying
race all over the tield and Â¦won with a
pcore of 15 to S after a course of 2 minutes
20 seconds, in which the services of a
relief dog were necessary.
PalmHower ran a bye with Master Claire

undecided in a short course. It was a fair
â¢win, Strombolt ehowing the speed in both
runs. Charlie, a recent Kansas importa
tion, beat Rose of Tralee at odds of 6 to 1
on a fluke. Rose showed all kinds of
epeed over the youngster, but the con
tinued favor of the hare won the course
for him. ThÂ© winner, though lacking
epeed, ehowed himself clever and willing.
Mllldale was another good thing. In a

the past seven years she has been an in

a great favorite in the college. There were
no invitations sent out aside from those
extended to the teachers and pupils who
are still remaining at the college for their
vacation. The bride was given away by
Mrs. Mills. The decorations were beauti
ful â marguerites, ferns and orange bios-
Foms. Miss Howard is the fifth Mills girl
who has been married within the last two
months. Mr. and Mrs. Noe will make their
'â¢ home In Oakland.

charm of the occasion.

sie S. Easton sang "O, Promise Me." and

i impressive. The brides appeared very

â¢~ Many women can trace their ruined complexions to the use of injurious cosmetics which, at their best, simply : '~ZS
EE: COVER UP defects. They try one preparation after another, hoping to find one that will bring back what has been lost,
Sj~ but it will never return. There is but one way and that is to SECURE A NEW SKIN. All physicians and dermatologists ââ¢
Â£T agree on one point, that, when the outer cuticle is stained with freckles, tan and other discplorations, or has a muddy, "ZZ
~Z roughened appearance, there is but one way to eradicate the defects and that is by using a preparation which will surely, |~2
IEr but not too hurriedly, take off the outer skin and with it the blemishes. No truer words were ever said than that
Â£^ COAXES A NEW SKIN. It is the result of years of study and experimenting, and today stands alone as a time-tried ~;
â¢~ remedy which cures. It passed the experimental stage ten years ago, and since then has been used by thousands of dis-

A Blest Remarkable Remedy That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
â¢ to Men.
A Free Trial Package Sent by Mail
to Ail Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had bat-
tled for years against the mental and
physical suffering of lost manhood that
the institute has decided to distribute
free trial packapes to all who write. It
is a home treatment, and all men who
surfer with any form of sexual weakness
resulting from youthful folly, premature
loss of strength and memory, weak back,
varicocele or emaciation of parts can now
cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculff.rly grateful
effect of "warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that
come from years of misuse of the nat-
ural functions and has been an absolute
success in all cases. A request to the
State Medical Institute, 328 Elektron
building. Fort Wayne. Ind., stating that
you desire one of their free trial pack-
apes wiil be complied with promptly. The
Institute Is desirous of reaching that
great class of men who are unable to
leave home to be treated, and the free
sample will enable them to see how easy
It is to be cured of sexual weakness when
the proper remedies are employed. The
Institute makes no restrictions. Any man
who writes will be sent a free sample,
carefully sealed in a plain package, sq
that its recipient need have no fear of
embarrassment or publicity. Readers are
requested to write without delay.
SENT FREE TO MEN!

Â¦WASHINGTON, June 2.â After an ex
tended debate the Senate to-day passed
the bill providing for the extradition of
persons who have committed certain
crimes in Cuba from the United States to
the^ island. As amended the bill provides
that the alleged criminal shall be pun
ished under the laws of Cuba as admin
istered by Cuban courts.
The last of the appropriation bills â the
general deficiencyâ was passed, as also
was the emergency river and harbor bill,
providing for numerous surveys and for
certain other public works.
Morgan, chairman of the Committee on
Interoceanlc Canals, made a request that
the so-called Hepburn Nicaragua canal
bill be made the special order for consid
eration at 2 p. m. on Monday. December
20 the second Monday of the next session.
Morgan said he realized the impossibility
of obtaining consideration of the bill at
this session. His request was agreed to.
The Philippine bill was then taken up,
and ClayHGeorgia) made a speech on the
tremendous growth of public expenditures
since early days. ' n
Stewart addressed the, Senate on the
Philippine question. He argued that the
treaty of Paris was the law of the land.
Every American citizen was bound by it.
To advocate the cause of Aguinaldo was
to oppose the law of this country. Sym
pathizers with Agulnaldo's cause cannot
extenuate their course by the employ
ment of such terms as "imperialism ' and
"militarism." The advocates of Aguinaldo
have challenged the forces of the admin
istration to a battle at the polls, and that
challenge has been accepted. The result
could not be doubtful. The American peo
ple would support the administration.
He said Cuba was the key to the Gulf of
Mexico and should always be controlled
by the United States. Ho was inclined to
the belief that Cuba eventually would be
annexed to the United States by the wish
of the Cubans themselves.
Senate Passes the General Deficiency
and the Emergency River
and Harbor Ap
propriations.

CHICAGÂ©. June 8.â Ths spark of life In the
Wheat market was very feeble. - Speculators
have a habit of doing very little on Saturday,
and to-day, with Liverpool closed, they were
still lsess Inclined to bestir themselves. The
market opened firm because It was reported
that the Northwest needed more rain, but lapsed
into general stagnation,', and the relative weak
ness of Northwest" markets 'helped It' along.
July opened at â¬651 CGTiÂ»c. sold to 67',fcc and then
decllncikio GGUe, closing heavy 14c under yes
terday at 6C%fiC6?ic.
The Corn market was quiet,, but firm. Coun
try acceptances and receipts were both small,
and the bulls' contingent, lent some support.
Crop prospects were etiil ' reported favorable,
and the heaviness of. Wheat- pulled the market
down some; but the end" of the session found
the market firm. July closed a shade over yes
terday. '
The trade in Oats was unimportant. July
closed a shade under yesterday. - 'ttWRqpmgi
Provisions were firm as to Meats and weak as
respects Lard. The Lard weakness was because
of an increase of stocks where a decrease had
been expected. Trade was quiet. Â¦ July Pork
closed unchanged. Lard TVs^lOc down and Ribs
2Vf SiCc higher. - :

NEW YORK. June 2.â There was manifest
fceeitition \n thr trend of prices of storks to
day scd a doubt "was disclosed whether the

of ihe'coranany.
There were al?o one or two minor raiiroaa

reciting losses In prices, which reached to be

There has boÂ«n some slight stirring of specu
lative interest in the etock market during the
week and a show of strength, arousing !n the
minds of professional traders hopes that the
market *as on the eve of an inflow of capital

movement having the effect of lifting prices.
Evidently the phortB were nonplussed aver the
ea-jaiilmity with which the etock market had
acWited the large Irrokerage failure last week
and the emJillcr one -this week, and they
thought it cafer to covpr. On Thursday morn

Condition of the Treasury.
NEW YORK. June 2.â The Financier says:
The banks of New York City gained . over
$4,000,000 in cash list week as a result of their
operations with the interior and the Treasury.
This was largely in excess of the known re
ceipts Of currency,- but even more surprising
was* Â£he expansion of $7,347,600 in loans, with
a coincident rise of $11,344,200 In deposits. As
a usual thing unexpected changes of large vol
ume In the statement can be traced to the
operations of one or more large institutions, but
in the present case the increases seem, to have
been distributed Impartially tfmong quite a
number of prominent banks. There has" been
no demand for funds other than normal, Â«nd
the inference is that the sudden rise reflects
one or two belated special operations pre
viously mentioned in this analysis. The loan
total, now standing at $S0O.26S.60O. is the largest
in the history of the New York Clearing-house
and surpasses by nearly $6,500,000 the previous
high-water mark, recorded on July 8 last year.
The loan Item has expanded $12,500,000 since
May 5 last. In 1SS9 the same period witnessed
a decline of $30,000,000, but beginning In June
there was a sudden Jump in loans, which
Placed the total in July, as stated, at the
highest point then known. In the face of
present conditions it does not seem possible
that there can be a continuance of the factors
which are responsible for the heavy changes
noted above. At this time last year the surplus
of the banks was nearly $43,000,000; two years
ago It was $52,000,000. In . each year the cul
mination of excess cash came at the end of
the spring months, and If this is to be repeated
now the present exce?s of $20,000,000 will
dwindle very rapidly. Still the banks are hold
ing their own. for the surplus, ,in spite of the
heavy demands made for increased reserve re
quirements, is actually rising. The approach
of the crop season will probably witness 'a
liquidation of the heavy volume of - outstand
ing commitments, although that gold will
come from Europe is as yet an undecided
point. Bank circulation Increased largely In
May and gold from the Klondike will be ar
riving soon. Per capita circulation is actually
expanding, despite exports of gold, but the
money of the country is in use by the banks.
The present total of deposits, however, In New
York Is nearly $27,000,000 under the maximum
reported on March 4. 1899. Even on that' date
the surplus cash in banks was over $4,000,000
In excess of what Is held at present.
WASHINGTON, June 2. â To-day's statement
of the treasury balances In the general fund,
exclusive of the $150,000,000 gold reserve, shows:
Available cash balance, $146,656,563; gold, $69,

The various barriers have been de
scribed heretofore. The settling basin as
designed Is capable of holding about 14,
000,000 cubic yards of tine sediment, and by
extending it farther to the westward can
be enlarged to a capacity of at least 50,-
OuO.OUO cubic yards additional.
The commission in recommending 1 the
project pays a tribute to Mr. Vlscher.
wiiose "labor, thousht and skill In work
ing up a project of such unusual character
and scope merit our highest appreciation
and are worthy of every commendation."
Attorney tJeneral Tirry I*. Ford reiter
ates that this is understood fully and
fuliy approve by the miners.
"It will be several years." he said In
an Interview, "before it will be definitely
known how much of a success the works
(.n tht YuLa River will be. The llrst ef
fect will be to determine whether they
are capable of storing the debris now in
the Yuba and Its tributaries. If they are
not a success, then, of course, hydrau
liekir.g will not be resumed there and
will not be resumed at all until the suc
cess or failure of the experiment which
promises so well has been demonstrated.
The first benefits come to the farmers.
The California Miners" Association has
expended $1000 to assist in this matter.
That is an indication of our faith in the
success of the plan. If failure is the re
sult, about Jl.00u.000 of the people's money
will have been lost, but -Â»ve do not believe
that there will be a failure. The capacity
of the expansion of the proposed settling
basin to hold the lighter material Is prac
tically unlimited."
The Importance of the subject and the
discussion going on warrant a repetition
of some of the principal points contained
in the reports of the California Debris
*'omml?siun. The primary object is to
store the mining debris within the bed of
the Yuba River by a system of works de
signed to separate the coarse material
from the fine; and the secondary is to
control the low water channel within nar
rower and well-defined limits, in order to
preserve in place the existing deposits in
the river below. The general scheme Is to
erect several barriers across the river, the
upper ones *to be located about three
miles east of the mouth of Dry Creek,
known as Barriers 1 and 2, respectively;
another to be situated Just below the
mouth of Dry Creek, to be known as the
flood overflow barrier: another to be
placed at Daguerre Point; also to form a
settling basin about three miles In length
and half a mile in width on the south side
of the river, this to consist of a levee pro
tected against wash, to be built In the
bed of the river, with its upper and lower
ends connecting with the existing levee
and higher on the south bank, these end
walls to -have inlet and outlet weirs and
conduits to regulate the inflow and out
flow of river water and tk cause the liner
material carried In suspension to be de
posited and held in the settling basin,
through which at all times, except ex
treme flood stages, the river will be com
pelled to flow, and below this basin to
confine the river channel within well de
fined lines by necessary training works.

Debris Commission on the subject of im

Uiver. The advance proofs are in the
hands of the commission to be read and
returned to Washington with such correc

few. Therefore It will not be many
months before printed copies of the report
will be sent out. In the interim since the
publication of much of the report in The
Call some misunderstanding seems to
have arisen in certain quarters concern
ing the Immediate effect that the pro
posed darns and settling basins will have
upon hydraulic mining in the water shed
of the Yuba. There are some who assert
that hydrauMcking will be resumed on a
large scale at an early date and the mur
mur of discontent is already heard. The
fact is that all this is based upon misap
prehension. The language of the report
is sufficiently explicit on that score. It

. SAN RAFAEL. June 2.â Onnpres's will
eoon be aektd to Indemnify seme of the
old Spanish residents for Josses of Jiorses
and cattle sustained by them during the
Mexican war. The presentation of thf
claims will brirg to light some of the
early history of the State, of which few
people nave any knowledge.
The bulk of the claims will bo for horses
and cattle taken for the use of the United
States forces under Oeneral Fremont dur
ing and shortly after the conquest of this
State. The principal claimants in this
county will be Stephen Richardson, son of
Captain Kichardson. who cwr.ed the Sau
salito rnncho; the heirs of Juan J. Heed
of the RÂ«ed rancho, tlie heirs of Greporia
Brlones, Bolinas rancho; the children of
Raphael Garcia of the Rancho del Punta
Reyes, the heirs of Domingo Sais' and
Tlmoteo Murphy and the children of Ig
raclo l'Â£checo of the Pachcco rancho.
From all .of. these ranches Fremont
made levies of saddle horses and beef cat
tle. The Spaniards had thousands of
head on the rar.jÂ»Â«-r. ami the work of col
lecting the be:Â«t- was comparatively easy.
The nrroy officials employed a man" named
William Smith, an early resident of the
State, as a guide to the ranches where the
bes: horses rr.iffht be found, and accord
ing :o the old Spaniards now living he did
his wcrk thoroughly.
The Richardson. ranch lost- about ninety
of its best horses, and tin? pric? paid Â»Â¦Â»Â»
nothing. Brionos. Saip and need all con
tributed their share of livestock. Ignarto
Pach^co lost over a hundred eadille
horses.
An earnest effort is now brine mad* to
collect proof to back these claim?. The
matter will be brought before ?"oner*-**,
where the descendants of thÂ« earlv nÂ»n< h- 
ers will seek Justice. Much truutile trill
be experienced In getting the proof. aÂ» th*>
native Cnlifornlan abhorr<*d l>ookkÂ«*Â»pinÂ£
and in most of the business transactiotui
of life was satisfied with th* accuracy of
fcis memory.*
Stephen Richardson, the o'<Vst native
eon in the State, says that when a yotirg
man on his father's rancho at Fausaltto
he assisted in killlt.g . hundrÂ«-ds vt
head cf cattle for the naval vessels that
Â¦would anchor off the town, and that the
r.avy always paid cash for poods r<->-.-ivi-.l.
Mr.Rirl'.ardson could not say a? much for
the army, or at least the portion repre
sented >n the levying in this county, ilost
of the knowledge of the transactions lms
been handed down to the present rtprÂ«
pentatives of the old families by their
fathers. Some will undoubtedly prove
their claims, and after fifty years the
Government will be called upon to right
a wrong that was nearly forgotten.
It is safe to say that if the old Span
Inrds had all of their ranches and cattlt
the debt would be forgotten and consid
ered paid, but most of their princely do
mains have melted away, and while a few
are well oft and light-hearted as in the old
days, many feel the heavy hand of mis
fortune.
