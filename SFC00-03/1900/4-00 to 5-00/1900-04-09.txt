"You deserve it." was the answer.

LfDNDON, April 3.â General Brabant's column at Wepener, on the Basuto
border. Is threatened by a Boer force, and he has been summoned to surren
der.
Bcwr activity continues, and this morning's dispatches Indicate that the
burghers are advancing around Bloemfontein. threatening the railway line,
ar.d that Boer commandos are on the move in all directions. In the
southeastern district farmers who lately made submission are everywhere
bringing out hidden Mausers and rejoining the Boor ranks. The British force
at Rouxville has fallen back to Aliwal North, owing to a superior force. The
Boer? Ftlll hang on at Ladybrar.d and have advanced within eight miles of
Bloemfontein on tne east. It seems that all these are different parties from
those who managed to squeeze past between Lord Roberts and the Basuto
frontier, these last being reported to have reached Kroonstad 6000 strong with
guns and JOT with wagons, after a journey of three weeks.
Simultaneously with these Boer moves in the Free State comes a report of
burghers in Natal b^ing reinforced through passes, presumably the western
passes, with transport and guns. This may turn out to mean that, the passes
having now been strengthened, the Bo^rs are able to spare men to help the com
mandos in EiggarFberg in making an attack via Helpmaaker, or as another tel
egram suggests, on General Buller ana Southeast Natal.
In the meantime Lord Roberts cannot move in force, owing to his lack of
horses and warm clothing. Want of the latter, says the dispatch, is respon
eible for an outbreak of pneumonia amonp tne troops.
A message from Mafeking brings down the ctcry of the siege to April 1. It
shows that the garrison was in sore straits, for food, while its bread grows
blacker and its rations become smaller every day.
The tendency to exaggerate the British and minimize the Boer successes,
which Â»sm Hr-Mi very-*videm from the rtart of thr- war In the work of correspond
ents and the censor, has never been more plainly shown than by descriptions
n.i\A official reports of the engagement near Boshof and that near Reddersburg.
A great splurge is still being made over the Boshof affair, where the odds were
about 6 to 1 in favor of the British, but It is not easy to get complete informa
tion about the other affair, in which the boot was on the other leg. In the first
the Boers lost every man, some sixty. In the second, three companies of the
Irish Rifles, two mounted companies of the Second Northumberland Fusiliers â
nearly CO â were wiped out of the British effective list by a force five or six times
as strong. All we can learn is from wounded Boers allowed to return. An
Impartial observer might remark that British generals think it much more im
portant to capture sixty Boers than to lose six hundred British.
A remarkable statement, which, if true, reflects most seriously upon the In
telligence and capability of British officers, is contained In a report from Gen
eral De Wet to Pretoria regarding his attack on General Broadwood's column at
Koomspruit. He says that the Boers found the British camp slumbering peace
fully without a sentinel or outpost to give the alarm. This, be it remembered,
was on a night following a day's hasty retreating, during which several rear
guard actions were fought.
Sergeant Patrick Campbell, husband of the well-known and popular actress,
was among the killed in the fight at Boshof. The War Office has issued a list of
killed and wounded non-commissioned officers and men on Thursday. Nine were
Â¦wounded and only one killed. That one killed was a sergeant, Patrick Campbell,
ihe news reaching London when the curtain was falling at the Royalty Theater,
where the talented actress is now drawing all the town by her grand performance
of "Magda." The corps to which Sergeant Campbell belonged was inspected by
the Prince of Wales at Albany-street barracks shortly oefore the men left for
South Africa, and Sergeant Campbell was singled out for presentation to his
Royal Highness, a distinction which was conferred on him alone among the rank
and file. - - Â¦

NEW YORK. April s.â A thrilling
story of the alleged massacre of
Filipino prisoners by American
soldiers is told for the first time
in a letter written by a Brooklyn
boy, - Corporal . Leonard Mygatt.
serving in the Philippines with the Twen
ty-third Regiment, of Regular Infantry.
According to Mygatfs story, to- avenge
the murder of their comrades, thirty men
of Mygatt's company led unarmed Filipi
nos into a jungle ' and fired volley after
volfey into them, until all of the brown
skinned captives lay dead.
â¢ Mygatt's graphic account of the slaugh
ter of prisoners is full of horrible details.
He was, he says, an actor in the great
tragedy from beginning. to end. and in a
letter to his sister, Mrs. Harry A. Pow
ell of Brooklyn he has told everything
just as he saw and experienced It.
. Undoubtedly the killing of the prison
ers will lead to a thorough Investigation
by the War Department. Several times
before there have come from the Philip
pines whispers of the shooting or bayon
eting of Tagal prisoners, but this is the
first time a thoroughly reliable man has
given above his own signature details of
such a horrible act.
Not OnD Wa3 Spared.
"Do not let one escape," was the order
from Mygatfs captain; and, Mygatt. in
his letter, says not one escaped.
Though Mygatt does not name the cap
tain who gave the orders, it is supposed
he refers to Captain Cloman of the
Twenty-third Regiment, as he was with
Captain Cloman's company.
While Mygatt and four companions were
out in the interior on an exploring expe
dition they were attacked by treacherous
natives, whom they were entertaining.
One of Mygatt's companions was mur
dered outright, another so severely wound
ed be died a few hours later and two
others almost fatally wounded. Mygatt
was the only one who escaped unharmed.
According to his story he put his
wounded, dead and dying comrades Into
an open boat and sailed with them thirty
five miles to the outpost at Bongas. where
the company was stationed. As soon as
Mygatt reported the outrage, he says, the
captain gathered up a detail of forty men
and started for Balamblng, where the na
tives had attacked the little party of
Americans. On the way to Balamblng the
captain.- according to Mygatt, gave him
these unmistakable orders:
"Corporal, if I am hurt so I cannot give
the command I want you to understand
that not a House is to be left standing, and
not a Moro alive."
Arriving at Balambing the ' Americans
corralled every male Moro. the total num
ber of prisoner^ taken being over 200, all
grown men.
The captain elicited confessions^ from
the. prisoners who had assisted In the at
tack upon Mygatt and his comrades. The
next "morning all men who had aided in
the treacherous assault were'killed under
orders from the captain, who, according
to Myeatt, said'
LONDON", April 0, 4:40 a. m.â When
it is borne In mind that all the dis
patches from the front are severe
ly censored, thfre is little in the
news to bring satisfaction to Eng
land. Assurances that nothing need be
feared, even if the railway and telegraphs
are rut and Bloemfontein isolated, to
gether with the news that the ladled and
other civilians are being ordered away,
do not augur well.
There are rumors from Cape Town that
the telegraph wires were already cut yes
terday (Sunday) and also that the Hus
sars who were sent to the relief of the
Royal Irish Rifles are also missing, al
though probably these are the outcome
of Boer exaggerations designed to en
courage the burghers.
The attempt of General Colville to catch
the Boer leaders in conference at Reitfon
tein failed, probably, as usual, because of
the lack of cavalry.
The result of these serious checks to
the British arms is that the whole FreÂ«
State is up again and that the Boers are
full of activity over the entire, field. A
belated Boer dispatch nays that bayonets
were made for the foreign legion under
the late General de Villebois Mareuil. The
Boers are boasting that the Colesbcrg and
Stormberg commandos, .numbering 6000,
with ten' cannon and 750 wagons, have got
safely through, thus performing a "mag
nificent strategic feat."
British' Surprised While Asleep.
A Boer account of the Bloemfontein
waterworks affair says: "Colonel Broad
wood evacuated Thaba Nchu owing to the
advance of Commandant Olivier from the
south. The Â¦Federal troops found the
British camp in peaceful slumber, with
out a sentinel or an outpost to give the
alarm. General 'de Wet . immediately
placed guns and the commandos in such
positions as to surround the British, who
did not have 'time to recover from their
surprise." â¢ â¢
The Cape Town correspondent of the
Times, discussing the affair, says: "All
the details only serve to bring out clearly
the marvelous cleverness of the Boers, no
loss than the marvelous carelessness and
improvidence of the British officers,
whom, it would seem, no series of disas
ters will ever teach to keep wide awake.
The Boers in Colonel' Broadwood's - rear
drove -his force into the party at the
drift exactly as partridges are driven to
a net.' At the drift itself, as each wagon
descended the hollow, it was shown which
way to drive,- so as not to block the con
voy. When the guns arrived the trap was
all clear again for their reception. As
one who was present said: 'It was like
a cloakroom. The Boers- politely took
your rifle and asked. you to kindly stand
to one side. There was nothing else for
you to' do.' " ;
The American scout' Burnham testified
to the terrific pace with which the Boer
commandos .cover the ground and the
ease with which they mofc'e- their guns.
The; Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph, in a dispatch dated' Fr
iday". says : "All is quiet here. Â¦ . Remounts
and reinforcements are arriving and prep
arations are being made to deal .with the

AUSTIN. Texas. April B.â Fully 30.000
people gathered at the dam and power
house stationed north of this city to view
the ruins of the plant, which cost this city
one and three-quarter millions of dollars
a few years ago. The waters of the Colo
rado River were still plunging and foam
ing around the wreck, eating away the
big pile of granite which once formed the
dam, as though it were nothing more
than chalk rock. So fierce was the cur
rent that great bowlders were carried half
a mile from the dam, being rolled over
and over by the turbulent tides.
The power-house, which succumbed to
the terrific force of the water at 2 o'clock
this morning, lies a mass of wreckage on
the edge of the river, all the valuable ma
chinery either having been thrown' into
the river or badly damaged by the fall-
Ing timbers of the power-house. The
wreck of the plant is complete.
City's Health Menaced;
The situation in the city to-night is most
serious. The wreckage of the plant means
that it will take several .weeks to secure
even a temporary water and light system,
if it can be made possible even then. In
the meantime the city will be In a bad
sanitary condition. All the hotels, private
residences, stores and the like are without
water ana there Is no fire protection.
Churches were unable to hold services to
night for want of light, and all public
meetings were abandoned. The daily
newspapers are handicaped In their pub
lications, being deprived of their electric
power.
The river Is falling to-night. Reports
from the neighboring country are to the
effect that everything Is under water. | In
Williamson County, morth of here, rail
road bridges and trackage have been laid
waste and all trains have stopped run
ning. Hundreds of head of cattle have
been drowned and miles of fencing torn
down and dashed away. In Bastrop Cqun
ty and in the southern portion of this
county similar conditions prevail, every
thing being under water and much loss
of property is reported. The country trib
utary to the Colorado River, all the' way
down its course. Is being inundated," and
while it is believed the worst is over the
loss as estimated to-night will exceed
$3,000,000, counting Austin as the largest
loser. Fortunately the list- of drowned,
according to reports up to to-night, is lim
ited to those reported In the Associated
Press dispatches last night, as it seems
the only drowning^ reported were here
when the dam broke and caught the vic
tims unaware.
A mass meeting of citizens has been
called for to-morrow In order that some

There were no trains operated on the
International and Great Northern Rail
road, as much of its track and quite a
number of bridges were washed away
during last night. The Missouri, Kansas
and Texas is also a heavy sufferer from a
like cause.
Bivers Now Receding.
HOUSTON, Texas, April B.â As a rule
the Texas rivers are now falling and
there Is not much danger of a general
flood. The crops have been damaged over
a wide area, but there is still time for
farmers to replant if they can get the
seed. Corn has been planted over once
and will have to be planted the third
time. The farmers as a rule have not
planted much cotton because the heavy
rains have kept them out of the fields.
The railroads have lost many small
bridges and it will be a week before traf
fic resumes its normal condition. Smith
vllle reports tremendous rains have fallen
throughout that section, and the main
flood in the Colorado from the great break
in the Austin dam reaching there this
evening. The river was .on a thirty-eight
foot rise at 7 o'clock and rising one foot
an hour. It Is estimated that over 5000
acres of growing crops In the bottom
lands within five miles of town have been
Inundated by from ten to fifteen feet. Tho
loss will reach $50,000. Much stock has
been drowned. No deaths have been re
ported in that section so far from drown
ing. Great excitement and uneasiness
prevailed last night.
Cameron reports the flood In Little
River now equals that of last July. The
waterworks and power house have been
overflowed. People were warned and no
loss of life Is reported.
Brushy, San Gabriel andj Little rivers
are all overflowed, causing the entire de
struction of crops. The rivers are still
rising. Reports from points on other riv
ers are of damage to crops, but no loss of
life.
Immigrants Suffer.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April B.â A par

who were caught by the storm on the
Southern Pacific Railroad west of Devils
River last Thursday, got back to San An
tonio to-day and were sent around by way
of Fort Worth and the Texas Pacific.
After the storm the tourists found them
selves in. a wild country, with six wash
outs between them and San Antonio and
nine washouts and missing bridges be
tween them and El Paso. The Eastern
tourists had the roughing it which they
did not bargain for. The 'damage to the
Southerin Pacific Is estimated at several
hundred thousand dollars.
LAREDO, Texas. April B.â The north

House Shoots at Him
Three Times.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LAYTONVILLE, April B.â News was re
ceived here to-night from Wlllits of the
attempted suicide of Mrs. Reid, wife of a
merchant of that place.
Mumm Reid, a druggist of Wlllits, ar
rived here unexpectedly this afternoon
and discovered Louis Felton, a merchant,
in his home. Reid drew a revolver and
fired three times at Felton. Felton fled at
the first shot and escaped Injury.
The guilty wife threatened to commit
suicide and her husband defied her to do
so. She became desperate, seized a bot
tle of carbolic acid, emptied its contents
into a glass and swallowed the poison.
Her condition is reported as critical and
faint hopes are entertained of her recov
ery.
Reid is the proprietor of the only drug
store In Willlts and Is also Town Mar
shal. His duties as an officer frequently
took him away from home and during his
absence his would Â¦- â ould attend to the busi
ness of the establishment.
It 13 presumed that while Reid was
away she became enamored of Felton,
who reciprocated the illicit affection.
Reid evidently suspected the condition of
affairs, and it Is believed he returned at
an unusual hour with the .expectation of
finding another man in his house.
In all probability when Reid again meets
Felton he will make another attempt to
kill him. Much sympathy Is felt for Reid,
who Is very popular In the community.
Felton Is a member of the general mer
chandise firm of Wllllts * Felton, and has
always borne a good reputation-

CALL HBADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTKL, WASHINGTON, April B.â
iW. B. Conkey and J. M. Glenn, members
of the committee of arrangements for the
Dewey celebration In Chicago on May 1,
arrived here this afternoon to present the
compliments of the .city of Chicago and
explain to the admiral the details of the
programme arranged for his visit to Chi
cago.
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Com
pany has placed a epecial train, consist
ing of three of its finest cars and one of
its most powerful engines, at the disposal
of the admiral. The train will leave here
early on Monday, April 30, and reach
Chicago early May L It has been de
cided that the party will consist of Ad
miral and Mrs. Dewey, Lieutenant Cald
well, Lieutenant Crawford, Ah Mah, the
admiral's Chinese servant, and Mrs. Dew
ey's maid, besides an escort of a party of
Chicagoans.
The railroad company offered to change
the schedule of the train that it might
pass through Ohio and Indiana during
the day time, so as to give the admiral a
chance to show himself to the people en
route if he desired to further his Presi
dential aspirations. It is said the offer
also included a promise to have a large
crowd on hand at each station, so as to
let the admiral feel the pulse of the peo
ple and make a few short speeches if he
wished.
Admiral Dewey declined positively to
listen to this proposal and said emphati
cally he was groin? to Chicago as admiral
of the navyâ not as a politician.
Will Bet on De-wey.
2TEVT YORK. April S.â Admiral DaweT*s
candidacy for the Presidential nomination
has brought ante-convention betting: to a
standstill and gamblers who wager on
elections, not from a standpoint of Indi
vidual sentiment, but purely from a busi
ness point of view, are not making any
offers of odda on any of those wno have
been named aa likely candidates.
"Joe" Vendlg. who several weeks a*po
offered that if McKinley and Bryan were
candidates he would bet $10,000 against
HOOO on McKinley's election, says that if
Dewey succeeds In winning the nomina
tion he will only offer even money
1 and will take the Dewey end of the
bet. Vendlg has been a heavy bettor In all
national and State elections and has also
handled and placed money for some of the
heaviest election bettors In the country.
"I figure President McKinley at 5 to 1
as against Bryan." said John R. Con
sldlne to-night, "and was ready to wager
my money at those odds, but with Ad
miral Dewey In the field things appear In
a very different light and I shall hold off
and do no betting until after tho conven
tions. Then If Dewey Is nominated I
shall wager my money on him, for he Is
the logical winner. A well established
war record la the strongest qualification
a candidate can carry In the field of poli
tics and Dewey certainly has a strong 1
one. He will be the natural favorite In
the betting. I think, as things look to-day.
I do not think there will he much bet tins
until after tho conventions."
WEBSTER DAVIS ACCUSES
BRITISH OF BARBARITY
Declares They Ignore the White Flag and
Do Not Give Decent Burial to .
Their Dead.
WASHINGTON. April B.â An Im
mense audience gathered at the
Grand Opera-house -to-night to
listen to an address on the war
In South Africa by the Hon.
"Webster Davis, ex-Assistant Secretary of
the Interior, who has Just returned to the
United States from that country. Every
available bit of standing room In the op
era-house, the largest auditorium in
Washington, was filled with auditors, who
paid close attention to every word uttered
by the epeaker and manifested their ap
preciation of his telling points with fre
quent and generous applause. Simple
decorations of the United State 3 flag, and
the red. white and black bars, with the
field of gTeen. the emblem of the Boers,
were suspended over the stage.
A score or more of public men. mainly
Senators and Representatives in Congress,
occupied peats on the stage and in the au
dience. Among them were the following:
Senators Daniel, Teller, Bacon, Allen and
Mason and Representatives Talbcrt. Jett.
Llttlefield, Ridgley. Robinson of Indiana.
Burk of Texas. Ball. Gilbert. Latimer,
Cox of Tennessee. Cowherd. Clark of Mis
souri, Barthold and Shafroth.
Mr. Davis was introduced by P. T.
Moran, the chairman of the executive
committee, who made a few introductory
remarks. Mr. Davis delivered his address
In an offhand, easy Ftyle, referring to his
rotes only occasionally, and mainly when
it was necessary to read an extract from
pome document or epeech. He spoke for
about two hours and at its close was
warmly congratulated. Said he:
The Boers of South Africa are among the
pioneer* of freedomâ heroes of civii and reli
gious liberty. They were the torxhbearers who
blared the pathway for civilization through the ;
primeval forests of the southern part of that ,
great "Dark Continent" which has been the :
marvel of the ages. No country in all the i
world -contains a nobler ra*>? of men and '
women. It was and is their unconquerable love i
for liberty that haÂ» caused all their troubles.
Great Britain's Crime
Mr. Davis entereu upon an eiuausnvc
review of the relations between the Boers
and the British Government from the
?ne of the absorption of Cape Colony to
ihc present. England's acquisition of the
diamond fields at jvimberley Mr. Davis
characterized as a transaction without a
parallel "for cupidity, dishonor and in
justice." lie continued:
It was after the discovery of gold in the
Transvaal that the British Government deter
mined to peek a pretext for obtaining control
of the richest gold :.. :J> in the world, as it
had before secured the richest diamond fields.
That this is the reel cause for the present
war no one can doubt who will but listen to
the frequent remark made by Englishmen In
South Afrtca. as wtil as in England, that "the
gold mine* in the Transvaal are worth fight
ing for and we are going to keep on fighting
ur.til we get th*rn."
No fliir.fcier pretext for robbery and murder
ever emanated from the wickedest Cabinet In
Eurc;-Â«* in its palmiest days than the British
derr.and for a five years* franchise in the South
African Republic. If this demand were granted
not an Englishman In the Transvaal would
renounce allegiance to the Queen and swear
*-temaJ allegiance to the Government Of the
South African Republic as against the British
Government. The idea was to obtain the power
to control the Government of the republic aid
at the same time remain British subjects. For
the BrÂ»ers to comply with the demands of the
Britlrh Government would have meant the sac
rifice of every vestige of essential so\ - erÂ«*lgnty
belonging to the Transvaal as an Independent
rercbllc.
The Boers ha\-e been greatly abused by the
British bfcauFe It 1* alleged they began the
war. In other words, the Boers were too
harty: they would not wait until all the Brit
ish troope had arrived in South Africa. "Who
ever heard of such nonsense?. That great civ
ilred nation of <ro.ooo.fiOo of people Is com
rilainirg bfcauEe the people of the two little
republics, who do not number, all told, more
than 2Jd.000 people. -Including men women
and children. Insisted upon issuing their ulti
matum ard then proceeded to give battle before
the BritiFh hosts should arrive; while on the
Boer side, all told, there were not more than
H.COI rr.Â«-n. and these had but a few Inferior
cannon ar.4 r.o bayonets or swords at all. Prac
tically the only arras they had were Mauser
riSe..
British Ignore White Flag
we have Â«Â«Â»*>n many charges made by Brit
iÂ«=h officers ar.3 British newpjjar-er correspond
ents that the Boers have frequently outraged
the white flag and the Red Cross flag. Upon
investigation, not only among the Boers them
relves. but among the 4000 British prisoners.
\ including the officers, who were at Pretoria
! when we were there, we learned that these
) charges were absolutely unfounded. On the
I contrary, we did learn that this was a set-up
I Job to deceive- not only the people of Great
Britain at home, but to deceive the peoples |
or other civilized countries. The truth Isâ
and I defy contradictionâ that the British sol
diers themselves are the parties who violated
I many of the rules of clvilired warfare and fre
! quently ignored the white flag and also the lied
! Cross flag. It was my fortune to witness some
of these scenes myself.
Mr. Davis described the storming of
Spion Kop by the Boers after the British
had occupied It. and his own visit to the
battlefield several days later.
When the fijrht began a giant Beer In the
prime and strength of manhood was seen carry
ing a small Boer flag. In a short time he fell
to rise no more. Then an old. white-haired
veteran picked up the fallen banner and. wav
ing it. urged his comrades on. With flowing
hair and flashing eyes the eld man rushed on.
but suddenly a shell laid him low. Ere the
little flag touched the ground atiarefocted lad
only 13 years <>{ age, who had been fighting in
his shirtsleeve*, leai*-d like a panther to the old
man's Â»ld<Â» and. snatching the flag from his
grandfather's nerveless hand, raised it aloft
and pushed on. A mighty ehout arose from the
Boers at- they saw that gallant deed, and with
renewed courace they made a fearful charge.
Following the flag they rushed like an ava
lanche over the-Brltlsh trenches, and Spion Kop
was won.
General Burners, the Boer commander, had
made repeated attempts to secure cessation of
artillery fire, that the dead might be burled,
but for several days without success. Kinally
General Buller accepted the Boer proposal to
bury the British dead and offered to pay the
bill.
Boers Bury Their Fallen Foes.
General Burgers regarded this reply as an in
Â«tult. but nevertheless concluded to bury the
Hritlsh dead. Then I visited the tcp of Spion
Kop and few there the moet horrible sight that
could be imagined. I'pon every hand were hel
mets, belts, canteens, bayonets and wearin* ap
parel scattered about, covered with clotted
blood. We taw feet and hands protmdlnjr
through the ground, all swollen, and with the
Fkln burst asunder, while the rest of the body
was covered with a thin coating of earth. The
explanation was that these poor British sol"
dlers had been burled by their comrades under
only a few inches .of dirt. In other places we
fsw scores of dead British soldiers lying on top
of the ground JuÂ«t where they had fallen, no
attest having been made to bury them. As
we descended from the hill we met the Boer*
Foine up to bury the British dead who had
been so sadly neglected by their own comrades
and commanders, who amuse themselves by
calling the Boers savages.
As citizens of the greatest republic In the
world, with which side should we sympathize?
I say our sympathies should go out to that
brave little band of patriots who are struggling
to keen alive forever the fires of liberty upon
the altars of those two younc republics.
At the conclusion of Mr. Davis* address
P. Lowtrr special commissioner
from the South African republics, made a
brief address. Then Chairman Moran of
fered a series of resolutions expressing:
"our deep and heartfelt sympathy for the
h^ri-iic patriots of the South African re
publics In their immortal fipht for their
homes and liberty, and our admiration of
their indomitable courage and unexampled
heroism in their wonderful struggle
apainst the British enemies of republican
povernment." commending the "Washing
ton PoFt for Its work in behalf of the
South African republics: thanking Mr.
Davis for his eloquent and masterful pre
sentations of the struggle between the
Boers and the British and tendering him
applause for his "manly course in taking
the lecture platform as a free American
citizen to pjead the cause of freedom and
republican government in South Africa,"
and assuring him that the great mass of
the American people are in sympathy with
the Boers, and that . "we denounce the
prf-ser.t British Government and its secret
rill^s in this country as wholly unworthy
of the respect of any true American citi
zen."
The resolutions met with cordial recep
tion by the audience until the final decla
ration denouncing the British Govern
ment and its secret allies In this country
was read. This was received with a storm
of hisses and cries of "No. no." Mr. Mo
ran then asked for a vote on the resolu
tions as a whole. There were a great
number of ayes and It seemed almost an
equal number of noes, and the ehairmau
declared the resolutions carried.
In his opening address Mr. Moran at
tacked the administration and was greet
ed with hisses and cries 01 "Traitor!" .

GRANT OF A ROUTE
FOR ISTHMIAN CANAL
This Country to Acquire Territory
From the Governments of Costa
Rica and Nicaragua. â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April B.â An official of
the administration is authority for the
statement that arrangements have been
practically concluded with the Govern
ments of Costa Rico and Nicaragua for
the acquisition by the United States of a
strip of territory ten miles wide between
Graytown and Brito, through which the
Nicaragua canal will be constructed.
There are certain diplomatic phases of the
negotiations yet to be perfected, but It is
understood that these are rather matters
of detail than of principle.
Rear Admiral John G. Walker, presi
dent of the Isthmian Canal Commission,
sounded the Central American Govern
ments as to the action they would take
in the event of a formal proposition from
this Government looking to the acquisi
tion of the necessary territory and the an
swers he received were generally of , a
very satisfactory character.
STILES MURDERED
BY HIS COMPANIONS
Desperadoes Probably Feared That
He Would Again Cause Their
Arrest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSOX, Ariz.. April B.â A report was
received here to-day that Alvord and
Bravo Juan, the fugitives who escaped
from the Tombstone Jail, killed Billy
Stiles, their liberator, last night. Stiles
was responsible for the arrest of Alvord
and testified against him at Tombstone
on the charge of holding up the train at
Fairbanks.
Alvord was afraid that Stiles would
again deceive him. Mrs. Alvord, wife of
the desperado, is in Tucson and It Is be
lieved that Alvord has left Bravo Juan
and is coming this way. The two posses
are still In the field and have not been
heard from directly.
Sentence Too Mild.
BERLIN, April B.â On the ground that
the punishment is too mild for the offense
Emperor William has refused to confirm
the sentence to a short imprisonment
passed upon Lieutenant Prince Prosper
Arenberg, who last year murdered a negro
in German Southwest Africa, under cir
cumstances of peculiar atrocity.
British Soldiers Arrive.
HALIFAX, N. S., April B.â Some 300 of T
fleers ami drafts of men for the British
Pacific squadron and for the garrison at
Esquimau, B. C. arrived to-night from
Liverpool and proceeded at once to the
Pacific Coast.
MELTS STEEL
AS THOUGH IT
WERE BUT WAX
Intense Heat Generated by
an Invention Tested at
New York.
German Scientist Drayfus Exhibits
His Process to Thomas Edison
With Most Successful
Results.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April B.â Think of 5100 de
grees Fahrenheit, in which a great bar of.
steel melts like wax around a candlewick.
This temperature, it was announced by
those who made the experiment on Satur
day in Thomas A. Edison's laboratory at
Orange, N. J., was generated by a new
process.
Let no layman measure the heat of the
sun at close range. The men who made
this experiment measure the intensity of
heat by the time it takes to melt a bar
of steel of given resistance.
The experiment was made In Mr. Edi
son's presence by Louis Dreyfus of
Frankfort-on-the-Main. who wished to de
monstrate to "the Wizard" the practica
bility of a process invented in Essen, Ger
many. Mr. Edison; Mr. Dreyfus, Harold
F. Brown and The Call representatives
were present. The process consists, in
brief, in the combustion of a certain
chemical compound, in connection with
powdered aluminum. Mr. DreyXus placed
in a crucible. a bar of steel six incnes in
length and half an inch in diameter,
placing around it a teacupful of his chem
ical. Pouring on this a small quantity of
powdered aluminum he touched a match
to it and in an instant it blazed up, throw
ing out an intense heat. In less than ten
seconds by the watch the steel bar was
completely melted.
Mr. Eidson was delighted at the results
and said that the process was what he
had been in search of for a long time. He
ordered a quantity of the chemical for
further experiments.
Mr. Dreyfus said that the process was
now being used in welding together steel
rails. By a simple device the chemical
and aluminum can be fed continuously at
any desired point and local application of
the heat continued as long as desired. It
was agreed by the experts that the heat
generated was 5400 degrees Fahrenheit.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
TWO grand fraternal bodies are to
meet on the Ist of May in San Luis
Obispo and remain In session one
week. This fact has aroused a great
deal of enthusiasm in that section of the
State. The first Is the Foresters of
America, who will hold the Grand Court
session and be represented by about 300
delegates, who will be the exponents of
13.000 members of the order in this State.

business in 'the Pavilion. The two bodies
have agreed that they will join hands in
the matter of partaking of the hospitality
that will be tendered during the week to
the delegates, and a joint committee ar
ranged all the details. As a matter of
courtesy the Grand Army people allowed
the Foresters to select the one who shall
be grand marshal of the joint procession.

have been very active in arranging for
the reception of the visitors and they have
appointed the several committees that are
to have charge of the events of the week.

FIGHT AGAINST
BOSS RULE IN
SANTA CLARA
Good Government League
Plainly Defines Its
Position.
*
Will Withhold Its Support From Can
didates Who Are Named
Exclusively by the
Bing.
Social rWsratch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April S.â The Republican
Good Government League of Santa Clara
County has renewed its fight against the
Republican County Central Committee,
which is controlled by ex-Boss Rea. This
is really the text of an ultimatum that is
to be delivered to the State Republican
Committee, and which in the form of a
resolution was adopted at a meeting of
the League yesterday. This is also vir
tually a warning that unless the League
is given full representation in the con
vention this fall the members of the
League will not support the Congression
al or Legislative candidates that are to
be voted for.
The resolution, which was unanimously
adopted, is as follows:
Resolved. That the secretary of the Repub
lican Good Government League of Santa Clara
County be Instructed to inform the Republican
State Wr.tral Committee that under no circum
stances will the supporters of good government
in Santa Clara County be satisfied with the re-
Fults of any convention .Congressional or other
wise, in v.-hich the delegates are seated by ap
pointment by the County Central Committee.
This action is significant, coming as it
does from an organization that has a
membership of over 2000 voters in Santa
Clara county.
This same fight occurred two years ago,
when Rea and Mackenzie selected th*
delegates to the State and Congressional
conventions and entirely ignored the bet
ter element of the Republican party. At
that time the League sent a protesting
delegation to Sacramento, but they were
not seated. It refrained from placing a
Legislative ticket in the field, however,
so that a Republican United States Sena
tor might be assured from California,
and was instrumental In Santa Clara
County going Republican for Gage and the
Legislative ticket. The county gang tick
et at the same time met a disastrous .de
feat, and the Good Government League's
nominees were nearly all elected.
Now however, the League will not sup
port a Congressional or Legislative tick
et which it has not a voice in selecting.
After giving its united support to Sena
tor Shortridge and Assemblymen Arne
rich and Kelsey. these legislators worked
against all legislation the League favored,
and in the distribution of patronage it has
been totally Ignored.

OPPOSES THE
LEASING OE
NOME BEACH
Adverse Report by the Com
missioner of the Land
Office.
Also Declares Against the Proposal
to Rent Western Public Lands
to Owners of
TT rile
WASHINGTON. April S.-Several bills
which have been introduced in Congress
have been referred to Commissioner Her
man of the General Land Office for his
judgment as to their merits. One of these
provides that exclusive leases for mining
purposes may be granted to lands within
the territory of the United States which
lie below high water mark. It is pro
posed to grant exclusive leases upon con
dition that a bond of $5000 be given to in
sure proper fulfillment of the agreement.
Commissioner . Herman reports adversely
on this bill for the reason that while
Cape Nome is not specifically mentioned In
it, the evident." intent Is to make It apply
there. It is held to J>e contrary to the
policy of the United States Government
to grant exclusive leases of this character
to gold fields, and the proviso in regard
to a JoOOO bond would operate to exclude
poor miners from securing grants.
Another bill upon which an adverse re
port is made provides for leasing public
lands in the arid regions for. grazing pur
pones. An adverse report also has been
made upon a somewhat similar bill
of a more genreal and far-reaching
nature which provides for leasing any
available public lands for grazing. The
Commissioner says that the courts have
held such action to be contrary to the cus
tom of a hundred years which permits the
freo use of such lands by any one, and
says that in his judgment the time has
noe come to overturn this policy.
WILL TRY TO FORCE A
VOTE ON QUAY'S CASE
Senator Chandler Active in the Mat
ter, but May Fail to Gain Unan
. imous Consent.
WASHINGTON, April 8. â Senator
Chandler probably will make an effort
Monday to get the Senate to agree upon a
day for taking a vote on the resolution
concerning the seating of Senator Quay.
The indications are that for the pres
ent he will fall to secure unanimous
consent, and in any event the discussion
of the resolution will proceed.
Senator Carter hopes to proceed with
the consideration of the Alaskan Code
bill early in the week, with the hope of
securing action at an early day. There
are still some differences pertaining to
mining rights to be adjusted in this meas
ure and more or less discussion necessa
rily will precede their determination. The
appropriation bill for the District of Co
lumbia probably will be considered during
the week.
On Wednesday Senator Lodge will ask
the Senate to vote upon the Philippine
temporary measure, but he does not ex
pect to accomplish more than to get a day
fixed for the vote.
The Committee on Elections will con
clude Its consideration of the case of Sen
ator Clark of Montana during the week.
Senator Chandler, chairman of the com
mittee, expresses the opinion that only
one sitting of the committee will be neces
sary to determine the attitude of the com-
The feature of the week in the House
will be the closing fight on the Porto Ri
can tariff bill. The Republican managers
will carry out the programme agreed upon
In caucus on Wednesday, when a special

the motion to concur in. the Senate
amendments to a vote after several hours
of debate. Both sides are laboring ear
nestly to poll their full strength, but the
Republicans appear to-be confident that
the motion will carry by a safe margin.
They assert that the Republican opposi

the Line.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April B.â William J.
Bryan, who will begin his tour of South
ern California, arrived in Los Angeles
this afternoon at 2 p. m. The prospective
Democratic nominee was met at the Ar
cade depot by former Senator Stephen M.
White, chairman of the reception com
mittee; O. A. Crandall, chairman of ar
rangement committee, the full comple
ment of the committees assisting in the
greeting. Thousands of .persons crowded
about the station and lustily cheered as
Mr. Bryan entered his carriage. A pro
cession fpllowed the brass band that
stopped before the Nadeau Hotel, the
headquarters selected during Bryan's
visit to Los Angeles.
No attempt at display has been made,
and there was no spettch making. Many
admirers of the Nebraskan called at the
headquarters and were introduced. Mr.
Bryan is to-night the guest of former
Senator White, with whom he and a few
friends dined. Mr. Bryan will pass the
night at the residence of Senator White,
and has denied himself to all callers.
Should the plan that is whispered -to
night by many of the faithful be carried
out the possibility exists that the fore
most Democrat on the Pacific Coast, for
mer Senator Stephen M. White, will be
urged for Bryan's running mate next July
when the national Democratic convention
meets in Kansas City.
Those who profess to speak with au
thority say tliat White's candidacy, has
long been canvassed by the Eastern party
leaders, and that the coming of Bryan
to the coast at this time Is to consult with
the - Democratic Nestors of the coast re
garding the advisability of such a nomi
nation. The argument is advanced that
X White is selected, it will be the first
time that the coast has ever been so honi
ored, and that this will almost insure tho
electoral vote of all States west of the
Rocky Mountains.
So far as can be ascertained the pros
pective nomination of Senator White
meets with much approval.
Bryan is accompanied by the following
citizens from the North: San Franciscoâ
C. D. Lane, Seth Mann, W. H. Alford.

9 LOS OUVOS, April 8. â Rev. Joseph
Hemphill, pastor of the Presbyterian
churches at Los Olivos. Ballard and San
ta Ynez, committed suicide this morning
at 11 o'clock at his home near Ballard.
Deceased had prepared for the morning
service at Santa Ynez and the family was
startled at the sound of a shotgun in
the woodshed at the rear of the dwelling.
A member of the family upon rushing out
to ascertain the cause found Dr. Hemphill
on his knees with his head thrown for
ward to the floor. He had connected the
trigger of a shotgun with a broken chair,
cocked the hammer, and placing the gun
at the back of his head, literally blew
out his brains. Two witnesses at the in
quest testified that the deceased was
subject to fits of despondency, but the
deed was evidently premeditated, as he
left a statement with his family regard

Rev. John Hemphill of Calvary church,

was promptly notified of the suicide. De

THE WAR'S DELAY.
DESPITE the fact that the censored dispatches
sent out from South Africa seem designed to
conceal the existence of war rather than to
inform the world of its progress, enough is made evi
dent to reveal the difficult if not dangerous situation
in which Lord Roberts has got his army. For the
sake of capturing Cronje he cut away from* his base
of supplies and rushed to Bloemfontein. In the ac
complishment of that feat he appears to have ex
hausted his horses, or to have lost them by disease,
for ever since that first fierce swift rush he has been
unable to achieve any success whatever.
The Boers have resumed the aggressive. They
swarm around the British lines on all sides, cut their
communications, capture an important post here, a
wagon train in another place, a battery in a third
place and half a regiment somewhere else. In the
midst of these "unfortunate occurrences" the vast
British army is almost as impotent to use its strength
as was the huge Spanish armada in the days of Eliza
beth to exert its force against the nimbler ships of
England. Roberts, in fact, is at bay and can neither
advance with success nor retreat with honor. His
only course is to stand where he is and wait until
there have been. sent to him a sufficient number of
horses to enable him to sweep the Orange Free State
with clouds of mounted infantry and drive the scat
tered parties of Boers away from his flanks and com
munications. ? ,'. . '
The Government at London is doing all it can to
furnish the horses, but the obstacles in the way are
many. It is a long distance from Europe to the
Transvaal and horses are not to be transported from
the one place to the other within a week. Moreover
the horses carried to South Africa are liable to perish
from disease almost as soon as they arrive. It is
even probable the dreaded rinderpest has broken out
already among the horses of the British service and
that it, more than anything else, is the cause of the
long delay at Bloemfontein. If that be so, the situa
tion is much more serious for the British than the
censored dispatches reveal. Lord Wolseley from the
point of vantage of the War Office in London has
predicted that Roberts will enter Pretoria in May, but
Roberts himself from the point of disadvantage at the
front is reporting nothing but unfortunate occurrences
?nd would doubtless be well pleased if he were sure he
would be able to move at all in the merry month of
May. fWM?S
REPUBLICAN LEAGUE CLUBS.
ON the 27th of this month the convention of Re
publican League Clubs of California is to
assemble at Los Angeles and, as that date is
now drawing near, it behooves all localities desiring
representation to begin at once making preparations
for it There ought to be a Republican club in every
county, city, ward and district. Every considerable
center where there are a number of Republican voters
should have its club through which those voters may
obtain representation at the convention and where
no such clubs exist the work of organization should
be promptly undertaken.
The league clubs are the more useful to the party
inasmuch as they do not represent the rival claims of
aspirants for any office, nor are associated with or are
controlled by any facfion or clique. Their work is to
organize the rank and file for campaign work and to
give an efficient support to all candidates of the party
after their nomination. In past campaigns this work
has been so notable as to win the commendation of
Republican leaders in 'all parts of the Union and it is
not to be doubted it will be equally efficacious in the
campaign now approaching.
It is to be borne in mind that the one danger that
threatens the Republican party is that of overcon
fidence. That danger faces Republicans in many
States, but it is particularly menacing in California.
Our people have been so prosperous under the Mc-
Kinley administration, it is hardly credible a majority
of the voters should cast their ballots against his re
election. It will not do, however, to trust to the hope
that everybody will vote right. The Bryanites are
very sure to poll a large vote and if any considerable
number of Republicans remain away from the. polls
the State will be lost and with it the Presidency' may
be lost.
Under these circumstances the paramount duty of
Republicans is to form organizations which will en
able them to bring out the full vote of the party on
election day. That duty is one which the league clubs
have undertaken and the object of the State conven
tion at ' Los Angeles is to stimulate and rouse and
direct the members in its performance. It is therefore
of the highest importance that all districts of the State
should be represented at the meeting and it is to be
hoped there will be not one locality of considerable
population in the State that has not its delegates on
the floor when the convention is called to order.
We have had a sufficient number of disastrous floods
resulting from broken dams in this country to justify
the conclusion that in the construction of great works
of that kind hereafter there should be a strict govern
mental supervision to sec to' it that the economy of
thi company that owns the dam does not endanger the
lives and the property of those who live in the valley.

J and sending to the penitentiary six men guilty vof,
j lynching a man in Patrick County. ?
i If the example thus set by Virginia be followed else
,â¢ where,- the end of lynching will be near, at hand. It
j rarely happens that lynching is done by parties who
cannot be identified. . The trouble has been that when
arrested and tried it has been found impossible to in
duce juries to convict them, no matter how strong
j and clear might be the evidence against them. The
result has been that the lynchers have felt no restraint
in the commission of violence and have vied with one
another in efforts to carry it from one degree of sav
agery and fiendishness to another. Just as soon as the
law finds support in the South and juries can be ob
tained which will convict, the lawless gangs that prac
tice lynching will be -broken up and cowed into sub
jection. ,*:-.-
Several schemes have been devised in the Southern
States to check the evil, but none thus far has proven
effective. In some States counties have been made
liable in damages for lynching, but no damages have
ever been awarded. In Georgia it was proposed to
authorize special sessions of the courts' to try sus
pected persons without delay, but the scheme was
abandoned because it was recognized to be futile. In
fact the issue in every instance returns to the honesty
of juries in the performance of duty. Virginia has
taken the right path. If it can once be. assured that
lynchers will expiate their offense in the penitentiary
1 the South will soon be as law-abiding as any other
i section of the .Union.

MORE BATTLE PARKS.
Iâ\1 â \ ROCURING the establishment and the main
! / tenance of "battle parks" at the cost of the
*â¢ Federal Government has become something
like a political industry in the South and for the pur
pose of obtaining appropriations is almost as effective
as the establishment of custom-houses a thousand
miles from the sea or the improvement of. inland
streams which are dry one-half of the year, so as to
make them navigable for ocean ships in wet weather
and useful as wagon roads in dry spells.
The South has already a considerable number of
battle-ground parks and there are now before Con
gress bills providing for the establishment of several
more of them. Of these it is said that three are likely
to be passed at this session â one providing for a park
at Stone River, Term. ; a second for a park near
Atlanta, Ga., and the third for a park in Virginia
covering six thousand acres and including the sites
of the great battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellors
ville, the Wilderness and' Spottsylvania Courthouse.
? ' For the Virginia park a great deal may be said.
.That little section of ground has been the scene of
the hardest fighting and greatest battles of the cen
tury. â¢It is estimated that in the various conflicts
which took place upon it upward of 500,000 men con
fronted each other and that the number of killed or
wounded exceeded 129,000. Moreover the battles
were rendered more illustrious by the presence" of the
greatest generals of the war and to the deeds of hero
ism among the rank and file on both sides were kidded
the brilliant tactics of Grant and Sheridan, Lee and
Jackson and all their famous. associates.
There is not likely to be any great objection to the
establishment of these parks, for they have a practical
usefulness as well as a sentimental value. and will serve
the Government as fields in which to give instruction
in forestry. . It is to the credit of the Southern people
that they'are showing enough of loyalty and thriftiness
to promote such* parks and, while none of them will
ever rival in historic interest the field of Gettysburg,
they will still serve to recall the deeds of those Whose
valor freed the slaves and kept the Union* whole.
The German law-makers can digest most anything
the Kaiser wishes, but they have evidently concluded
it would be more dangerous to swallow his meat bill
than any amount of American pork.

BUSINESS CONDITIONS SATISFAC
TORY.
THE improvement in general trade mentioned
last week apparently continues. The weather has
become more seasonable in the East and the job
bing and retail distribution has increased proportion
ately. The failures, too, show a falling off again, thos:
lor the week being 182, against iyo for the correspond
ing week in 1899. But the country's bank clearings
still hang back, those for the week indicating a loss
of 5.1 per cent in business from last year and three
important cities â New York, Boston and Pittsburg â
exhibit a decrease ranging from 10.8 per cent in New
York to 18.7 per cent in Pittsburg. All other large
cities in the United States show an increase, though
gencra3!y small. The decrease at Pittsburg rcllects the
decline in the iron and steel industries, which have
been growing quieter for some time. Attempts are
being made to lower prices in order to stimulate busi
ness, but they are not very successful, as the great in
terests fear that any marked decline will still further
The other staples show rather more tone. Boots
and shoes are doing better and hides and leather are
also showing more tone. Wool is weaker, but woolen
goods are reported in fair movement. Unsettled labor
conditions and higher quotations have checked the
activity in lumber and most markets report a lessened
demand at easier price*. Provisions continue the
strongest line in the country. Pork is 30 per cent and
lard 25 per cent higher than at this time last year and
supplies are reported slender all over the country.
In the San Francisco market hogs have been more
or less scarce for a long time and their raisers have
made money. Cereals still drag and wheat obstinate^'
refuses to advance. Other grains sympathize and the
market for breadstuff's is therefore dull all around.
Wall street ruled quiet all the week. Any' decline
brought out buyers, but any advance immediately called
out an equal number of sellers. The public are not
investing as a rule and the professionals have the mar
ket pretty much to themselves.
Conditions in California continue bright. The sea
son has been exceptionally fine in the central and
northern parts of the State and large crops of almost
everything are assured. Low prices for pram and
hay are expected on account of the great yield prom
ised. As to fruit, the outlook is uncertain. The crop
bids fair to be heavy, but the demand is likewise ex
pected to be large, as stocks of canned and dried fruit
have become reduced to practically nothing, with the
exception of prunes, of w-hich there is still a fair sup
ply on hand. The formation of the Dried Fruit Asso
ciation will probably impart more steadiness to the
market and give Eastern buyers more confidence in
the maintenance of values. The wool market is
opening up sluggishly, as the dullness in the East
deters buyers. The movement in merchandise con
tinues good, both on local and export account, and
no complaints of collections are heard. Money is
plentiful and some banks are soliciting loans, whereas
a year or two ago they refused to loan on anything
except gilt-edged city securities.
The above points about cover the trade situation :n
the United States. The boom of last year is over
and the tapering off has been natural and smooth. We
rire now back to normal conditions and with ordinary
rare there is no reason why the country should not
enjoy its present prosperity for a long time to come.
The Presidential election this year will, of course,
<juiet things down somewhat, but that is rqerely a
temporary condition.
HOW THE CALIFORNIA PRESS VIEWS
ADMIRAL DEWEY'S CANDIDACY

There may be some people who still want the admiral for President as much

tial candidates have already made definite and different arrangements.

Admiral Dewey was for a time the idol of his fellow-citizens. Now that he

Admiral Dewey has been badly advised and has ..blundered. The American
people, mindful of his great services, will continue to admire and honor him. He
will learn, however, that these marks of favor do not imply a wish to place him
in the office which he thinks "not difficult to fill."

If Admiral Dewey decides that he would take a nomination for President on
either ticket he will have the satisfaction of realizing that he ia not the first man

THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 9, 1900.
PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.
DESPITE the: fact that to all appearances the
renomination of Bryan by the Democratic
. party is 50 certain that opposition to it is labor
in; vain; there are none the less many eminent Demo
crats who continue to form factions against him and
to talk as boldly as if they believed it possible to de
feat him.
At a recent dinner in New York there was quite a
gathering of prominent gentlemen opposed to Bryan,
and some of their utterances gave evidence of a firm
conviction that they have a fighting chance. It was
proposed that there should be a large banquet ar
ranged for April 13 in New York City and that rep
resentative Democrats from all parts of the country
?hould be invited to take part in it.
From an account of the gathering given in the New
York Times we learn that "as an incentive to action
Northern capitalists largely interested in Southern en
terprises have communicated their wishes to- their
representatives in the South, and expect wholesome
results." It is added: "The Commercial Travelers
and Hotel Men's Anti-Trust, League is also taking an
active part in the movement, and the members have
sent out a circular letter, in which they say: This
league has done enough work to demonstrate that Mr.
Bryan can be defeated for a renomination. The re
ports from our members in the South particularly re
sent the idea that the Populists should write the
Democratic platform. Indeed, in some localities this
has raised a storm of indignation, an,d they wonder
why the New York leaders do not blaze the way by
putting forward and supporting some such man as
Augustus Van Wyck. We wish to urge in the strong
est possible way that you will talk this matter over
with other leading spirits of the Democratic party
and see whether some organized effort cannot be in
augurated to take a public stand against Mr. Bryan's
renomination.' "
While that fight is forming against Bryan his sup
porters in some of the Eastern States at least are
acting very much as if they are afraid of it and are
willing to resort to any kind of tactics to win out.
Thus we learn from the Baltimore American that the
Bryan Democrats, who have complete control of the
party machinery in Maryland, have issued a circular
calling upon the voters at the primaries to pledge all
delegates to Bryan. The circular is quoted as saying:
"If they refuse to do this it can only be for the pur
pose of deceiving persons into voting for delegates
supposed to be for Bryan, but who would turn out
in the convention to be against him." "Beware," it
adds, "of unpledged delegates. Any delegate who re
fuses to be instructed to vote for Bryan does not in
tend to vote for him; any delegate who is not pledged
for Bryan, you may be sure, is secretly pledged
against him."
It appears evident from such a circular that the
fight against Bryan in the East and South is much
stronger than shows on the surface. Bryan js a
vociferous leader, and his following makes a good deal
of noise in cheering him, but there is a great, silent
mass of voters in the party that will have to be reck
oned with when it comes to the election of delegates
to the national convention; and, moreover, there is
a small but potent body of silent wirepullers in New
York working quietly to bring out all the opposition
to Bryan thtft can be found in that mass. Therefore
the plots and the counterplots are being worked with
zeal and energy on both sides. There is ample time
to arrange a surprise party for the Democratic Na
tional Convention, and it is quite possible Bryan may
find one awaiting him.
It has been decreed by the authorities that the cen
fus of the population of the United States shall be
taken during the first two weeks of June, and now if
the Haif Million Club be alive yet and feel lively it
will organize several kinds of festivals in the city for
those weeks and invite two or three hundred thousand
folks to come to town and be counted.
Malefactors in Victoria must be marvels of crimi
nal cleverness. The authorities of the town sent out
a small fleet of torpedo-boats the other day in an
effort to capture an absconder

The United States Bank.
The establishment of a national bank
was a matter which sharply divided the
parses in V ashington's first administra
tion, the debate turning upon opposing
views of the constitution. Jefferson and
Hamilton have left carefully stated argu
ments upon the questionâ the first from
tiie standpoint of the strict construction
of that document, the other from the
loo^e or liberal view of construction.
Hamilton's opinion was accepted by
"Washington, who signed the bill creating
the bank In 1731. It remained in success
ful operation until ISII. when the renewal
of Its charter was defeated on grounds set
forth by Jefferson. But In ISIS a new na
tional bank was created, the measure be
ing favored by Madison, who had strongly
opposed the first. This foreshadowed the
change In sentiment soon to become
marked In the Republican party. The con
stitutionality of the bank was affirmed
by decisions of the Supreme Court In ISI9
and in 1524. Though thus removed from
the constitutional discussion, .the ques
tion was still to enter again In a different
form into party struggles. Throughout
the era of good feeling it was one of the
subjects in respect to which leaders of
opinion differed and which had to do Â¦with
the new alignment of parties then In
progress.
Internal Improvements.
New York was the leader among the
States in Introducing a vigorous Stato
policy for the Improvement of the means
of transportation. The difficulties encoun
tered during the war of 1812 in moving
soldiers and stor?s made manifest the ex
treme need of such Improvement, and the
successful construction of the great Erto
canal, with the Immediate benefits which
resulted to the State, turned popular at
tention to the subject.
The constitution had In the beginning
granted to each State, with the approval
of Congress, the right to levy tonnagft
duties upon its commerce to be expended
for the facilitation of navigation. Each
cf the original States possessed a sea
coast, but there were soon Representa
tives in Congress from Interior States
having no coast line to be improved and
their broader views as to internal im
provements began to permeate the opin
ions of the general Government. As early
as 1806 a plan for building the great Cum
berland turnpike road from the Potomac
to the Ohio River at national expense was
brought forward along with a bill for a
road across the State of Georgia toward
New Orleans. Numerous other bills for
similar purposes were introduced but had
nearly all proved abortive. The constitu
tionality of such use of Federal funds was
constantly called In question, although
statesmen of all parties admitted its de
sirability.
Stimulated by causes suggested above,
popular attention was directed In a very
decided manner to the subject of Internal
Improvements during Madison's second
term. A bill appropriating money "for
constructing roads and canals and Im
proving the navigation of water courses'*
passed both houses of Congress in ISI7.
6ut was vetoed by the President as ex
ceeding the constitutional powers of Con
jrress. It had heen warmly supported by
Clay and Calhoun. President Monroe re
iterated the view of Madison In his first
annual message, but his opinions under
went some modification in the course of a
few years, for in 1522 he declared that
Congress had power to extend puM'o
funds at Its discretion, belnjr bound, how
ever, to choose such objects as should bn
of general utility. And he held that It
was "not the province of the President t<*
sit In Judgment upon Its selections." Still
an amendment to the constitution was In
his opinion needful before Congress could
enter upon a general system of Internal
Improvements. The pollcv to which Mon
roe now seemed committed was warmly
approved by his successor. John Quincy
Adams. Act followed act In quick suc
cession for carrylnsr It into practical oper
ation. The newer States eagerly accepted
the assistance of the national Government
as meeting their sorest need and as only
justly offsetting the favors already ren
dered to the Atlantic States by the pub"c
expenditures upon coasts and harbors. As
out of the chaos of the period the fssues
of coming battles .olorvly shaped th**Ti
selves the question of the constitutionality
of Federal aDproprlations for Internal im
provements became a clearly markc? di
visive element.

Federalist leaders whom he believed to be
monarchists at heart and wholly incorri
gible. He also clearly foresaw that when
this should take place division within the
Republican party itself was certain to fol
low. Writing in May.lSo2. he says: "We
shall now be so strong that we shall cer
tainly split again, for freemen thinking
differently, and speaking and acting as
they think, will form into classes of sen
timent. But it must be under another
name. That of Federalism has become so
odious that no party can rise under It."
During the era of good feeling the fed
eralist party, utterly discredited and de
moralized, did indeed disappear not only
from national politics, but from State pol
itics as well, though in a few States it
controlled State elections until after IS2Oâ
years after it was quite dead as a nation
al party.
Changes in the Republican Party.
This absorption of Federalism was at
tended by the appearance of a more lib
eral form of democratic doctrine in the
old Democratic-Republican party. The
practical exigencies which had arisen dur
ing the years of Republican domination,
had led the party chiefs to acts incon
sistent with that strict construction of
the constftution which was theoretically
their fundamental basis of party union.
Such were the purchase of Louisiana in
1803 and the embargo act of ISO 7. with oth
er measures believed to be r.eceasitated
by the unfriendly conduct of foreign na
tions. Such also were the tariff of 1316
and the revival of the national bankâ a
purely Federalist scheme in its origin and
strongly opposed by Jefferson as uncon
stitutional. A young Republicanism grew
up with Henry Clay as its natural leader,
but embracing many former Federalists.
It appropriated certain of the Federalist
doctrines and Incorporated them Into that
modified democracy which was the out
growth of practical experience.
Jefferson's political sagacity was able to
penetrate the veil of delusive harmony
which delighted the popular mind. From
his retirement at Monticello he wrote to
Gallatin in October. 1522:
"The same parties exist now as ever did.
No longer, indeed, under the name of Re
publicans and Federalists. The latter name
was extinguished in the battle of New Or
leans. Those who wore it. finding mon
archlsm a desperate wish in this country,
are rallying to what they deem the next
best point, a consolidated government.
Although this Is not avowedâ as that of
monarchism. you know, never wasâ it ex
ists decidedly, and is the true key to the
debates in Congress, wherein you see
many calling themselves Republicans
preaching the rankest doctrines of the old
Federalists."
President Monroe.
James Monroe of Virginia, who had been
an unsuccessful candidate for the Presi
dency In ISOB. succeeded to that office In
1817. He had been for years the leading
member of Madison's Cabinet. His large
experience in practical administration and
wide acquaintance with public affairs in
both hemispheres, combined with a
strength of character and dignity of man
ner, commanded for him the respect and
confidence of the whole people. His qual
ities were solid rather than brilliant. Less
conservative than Madison, he was still
not extreme in his views, though more
positively democratic. He regarded him
self as the head of the nation, not of a
party. Indeed, unlike Jefferson and Adams,
he seemed to have looked for the final and
permanent disappearance of parties and
the fusion of the whole people in a
single-hearted devotion to the "principles
of union and free government." He con
troverted the views of. many distinguished
statesmen that free governments cannot
exist without parties. That they had al
ways been found In the ancient republices
and In England he believed to be due to
"certain defects of those governments,"
rather than to the constitution of human
nature: and he was confident "that we
have happily avoided those defects in our
system." It was one of the avowed
objects of his official career "to conciliate
the people of this union with one another
and quench the ardor of party spirit."
Development of the Country.
Monroe's two administrations covered a
period of tranquil and prosperous growth
for the country. Happy In their release
from the alarms of war and their freedom
from the irritations of factional strife, the
people gladly devoted themselves to the
cultivation of the arts of peace. Popula
tion was Increasing rapidly. Manufac
tures In New Englar .Â» were assuming im
portant proportions under the first of the
tariff acts designed to favor the produc
tion of textile goods. Already a strong
movement of population westward had set
in. greatly accelerated by the increased
use of steamboats upon Inland waters,
which not only made travel easier but
gave access to market for the agricultural
products of the new lands. New States
sought admission to the Union. , Missis
sippi. Illinois. Alabama. Maine and Mis
souri were all admitted durine; Monroe's
term of office. The last was accompanied
by the Missouri compromise, of which we
were to hear much in after years.
The New National Spirit.
Not until the peace with England after
the war of ISI2 was there a general feel-
Ing that a real and permanent indepen
dence of the mother country had been se
cured. Then at last. the United States be
gan to realize their nationality. A wave of
fervid patriotism directed to the national
Government as such swept over the land,
carrying away for the time even Calhoun.

An Interesting account of placer mining
In Blue Bear Valley, Colorado, by the Oro
Grande Mining Company Is thus given:
"The company has ten miles of placer
ground, from Breckenridge to Dillon, and
Is using the Evans hydraulic elevator sys
tem for removing gravel and pay dirt.
The water is brought down from the pen
stock in a 30-inch pipe split into several
nozzles at the lower end. These play
against the gravel bank, and by two other
2-inch nozzles playing Into a 20-inch pipe
running from the bottom of the pit up
into a large 4-foot flume the sand, gravel
and smaller rocks are carried up into the
flume, where the lighter gold is caught in
the riffles, as in ordinary ground sluicing.
The water in this flume is the same as
that used for breaking down the gravel,
an 8-lnch pipe extending up alongside the
larger pipe, taking the water out of the
pit as rapidly as it enters by a similar
method to that used in elevating the dirt.
The larger rocks are raised by an electric
elevator, the electric power being gen
erated by the fall from the penstock to
the bottom of the gulch. The lower por
tion of the gravel and the bedrock seams
will be wprked out by hand and run
through a bedrock flume In the bottom of
kokomo, Colo., finds It impossible to get
enough cars to carry the ore that Is pro
duced.
The Mining .Press has a review of
the Government requirements concerning
dredging for gold at Nome and other alien
mining, locations. Some of the facts will
Interest those who are expecting to go
north soon. As to dredging, a Govern
ment permit is required to mine at any
United States point lying within three
miles seaward from low water mark. Such
permit must be procured from Secretary
of War Root, the War Department hav
ing jurisdiction- over the navigable wa
ters arid coast line of the United States.
Several such permits have already been
granted and more applications are on file.
One license issued to a deputy auditor in
the State Departmentâ George W. East
erlyâgives him exclusive concession to
operate dredgers 2000 feet outside low wa
ter mark for a stretch of two miles along
the Cape Nome coast. It seems to be a
case of first come first served. Permits
are only, required of or by those who want
to use mining machinery.
As to alien mining locations, the United
States law Is that no one not a citizen of
the United States, , or who has not de
claredhiÃ intention of becoming a citizen,
can lawfully ; locate a mining claim in
United States territory. Of course it fol
lows that any one making such location In
Ignorance or defiance of this law cannot
convey legal title to the' claim, and any
one buying such location under those con
ditions has no lawful claim to the prop
erty. This is not a State but a Federal
question, and Alaska being solely under
Federal Jurisdiction, the matter Is suscep
tible there of direct settlement.

The Southern California branch of the
California Miners' Association has been
having a lively time over the raise of the
Balary of the secretary from $25 to $100

at a meeting concerning the legality of a
preceding meeting, at which the secre

IV.â THE EBA OF GOOD FEELING.
(1817-1825.)
BY JESSE MACY, LL. D.
Disappearance of Partisanship.
The close of the war of ISI2. followed as
it was by the removal of burdensome re
strictions upon trade and the revival of
business. Inaugurated a period of eight
years which has been called the era of
good feeling because of the lack of parti
san strife which characterized it. Barren
as it has seemed to some of our ablest
historians, the time is memorable as
marking the disappearance of the early
political issues and the rise of other
questions which were to influence pro
foundly the future destiny of the repub
lic Though party conflict was wanting,
yet within this brief space may be found

The far-sighted Jefferson had lons be

lines faded away. As never before the
people felt themselves a nation. Signs of
the new spirit were seen in the system of
internal improvements undertaken at the
national cost, in certain decisions of the
Supreme Court of the United States,
which established the supremacy of that
court over State Judiciaries in Federal
questions, and In the re-establishment of
the national bank.
The tide of foreign Immigration which
now began to flow contributed to
strengthen the national spirit in the
Northern States, to which it was almost
wholly confined. How profoundly this
was to affect public feeling was not at
first perceived, but as years passed and
the sectional rift between North and
South grew wider the Influence of the
continued and ever more copious flow of
foreign population into the Northern
States became clear. To a foreign immi
grant accustomed to centralized govern
ment, the country to which he came was
one. Of the separate States as such he
knew little and for them cared less. The
Immigration of these early years was rap-
Idly absorbed Into the native population
and worked In a single generation a vast
effect upon the national sentiment, ex
cept in the South, where, wanting such
nationalizing aid. the doctrine of "States'
rights" grew to lnordlnant and fatal pro
portions.
The promulgation of the famous "Mon
roe doctrine" in the President's message
of 1523 doubtless contributed something: to

LIFE LOST IN A
NORTHWEST GALE
OFF THIS PORT
First Officer Johnson of the
Steamer Reporter Is
Drowned.
Chief Officer Ole A. Johnson of the
steamer Reporter lost his life in the heavy
northwest gale off .port Saturday. There
were several minor accidents, and no less
than three vessels had to put back for
repairs, while several that were ready
for sea did not dare to venture out.
The Reporter left here last Thursday
for Cook Inlet, but when two days at sea
the deck was found to be leaking badly,
and Captain LJndberg decided to put back
for repairs. Early Saturday morning the
steamer encountered the northwester
and took some heavy seas. Mate Johnson
was about the deck, making everything
fast, when the steamer gave a sudden
lurch and he lost his balance, falling into
the sea. In spite of the heavy weather
the steamer was hove to and every effort
made to save the mate, but without avail.
He could not swim, and the tremendous
seas soon swallowed him up. Johnson
was a native of Norway, 33 years old.
He leaves a widow and two children, who
reside in this city.
FROM SEA
AND SHORE
THE schooner Lillebonne, which sailed
Saturday for Grays Harbor, got into
the gale and lost her foresail. She
put back and repaired the damage,
sailing again yesterday morning. The
gasoline schooner Monterey had her ma
chinery damaged during the blow to such
an extent that she had to return under
sail for repairs. The pilot boat Grade S
had her topmast head carried away while
attempting to weather the storm.
Fight With Bare Fists.
There was a lively mill on pier No. 7
yesterday morning between the butcher of
the Moana and a member of the stew
ard's department. Bad blood had existed
between tne men for some time, result
ing in a challenge and acceptance. About
twenty-five or thirty spectators formed a
ring and a referee, timekeeper and -sec
onds were appointed. The men fought
with bare fists. Marquis of Queensberry
rules. The flunky was getting all the
worst of it in the fourth round, when he
landed a stiff punch on the butcher's eye,
cutting it wide open. That settled the
matter. The handler of meats acknowl
edged that his opponent was the better
man, and the combatants shook hands.
Missouri Will Be Retained.
Private advices from Washington give
information that the hospital ship Mis
souri will not. after all, be, retired from
the service. The necessary repairs will
be made, and she will be retained in the
Red Cross service. The same, source of
information says that the Badger, recent
ly transferred from the navy to the army,
will never be used as a hospital ship.
The Badger was towed down from Mare
Island yesterday by the tugs Relief and
Alert and tied up alongside the Logan at
the transport dock. She is a very narrow
craft, and sets so high out of the water
that she does not impress the average ob
server as being fit for the hospital serv
ice. She is very rusty, and dirty besides,
and her bottom is fearfully foul. -Chief
Officer Maguire of the Warren brought
her down. He is in line for promotion,
and will likely be appointed her master.
Released .From Quarantine.
Three trans-Paciflc steamers were re
leased from quarantine yesterday. The
transport Sheridan was the first, and she
anchored in the lower bay, where she
will to-day transfer the dead bodies she
has aboard to the bay steamer Caroline.
The Santa Fe steamer Belgian King went
directly to Lombard street wharf,
where she will discharge her cargo. The
O. and O. steamer Doric went to her berth
at the Pacific Mail wharf.
Sail for Alaska.
The steam whaler Beluga, Captain Bod
fish, sailed yesterday on a whaling voy
age. The Alaska Packers' Association's
steamer Elsie and the ship Two Brothers,
belonging to the .same company, sailed
yesterday for Pyramid Harbor with sup
plies.
Lumber for Nome.
It Is estimated that at least 20.000,000 feet
of lumber will be sent to Nome this

Steam Colliers Kace.
The steam colliers Matteawan and Pro
greso, which arrived late Saturday night
from Tacoma with cargoes of coal, raced
all the way down. They chanced to leave
the Tacoma bunkers at the same time.
The Progreso won the race by four hours,
her time being 100 hours.
Crowley's Launch Held.
Dr. Kinyoun, the quarantine officer, has
held Tom Crowley's launch at the Angel
Island station for three days, and is still
holding it, for the purpose, he told Crow
ley yesterday, of Investigating Wilson, the
man who hired the launch to run along
side of the Moana and talk to a friend
on board, as he claimed. Crpwley says
that Wilson is a contractor, and has some
important work on hand. Dr. Kinyoun
says he does not know the prisoner's right
name, as he has already given three dif
ferent cognomens. Kinyoun thinks the
man, had some scheme to work, and he
proposes to sift the matter to the bottom
before releasing" him. : - ; . '
Wilson Saves Another Life.
William Dugan. better known as
"Beans," an employe of Boatman Henry
Peterson, fell from Howard streef wharf
No. 3 yesterday, striking his head on a
barge and reaching the water in an un
conscious condition. Captain Wilson of
the launch Amy chanced to. see him and
pulled him out. Wilson has a long record
as a - life saver.
Sheridan's Launch Disabled.
The transport Sheridan's steam launch
was disabled off Black â¢ Point yesterday
and 'floated about helplesslessly for an
hour. The launch Amy offered her a tow,
but It was refused. Afterward the launch
reached Meiggs wharf
mrSTERY still surrounds the
death of F. W. Kreling, whose
body was washed up on the sands
of the Berkeley shore a week ago
yesterday. No motive can be assigned
for suicide, and that theory has been
practically abandoned by the relatives of
the deceased. The fact that he was
known to have had considerable money,
some valuable papers and a gold watch
oh his person when he last was seen on
the morning before his remains were
found, which were missing when the body
was examined at the Berkeley morgue,
adds some strength to the suspicion that
the old man ,met with foul play. The
supposition that he was in a boat with
John Uhlberg, the tailor, whose lifeless
remains were found the night previous,
near the spot where Kreling's body went
ashore, and that there is some connection
between the two mysterious deaths is still
being worked upon by the authorities of
the college town, but there is apparently
little upon which to base their suspicions.
Kreling is known to have been afraid
of the water. The story is told that while
members of his family were interested in
the Casino, at the park, he would not
even ride in the skiff that went around
the shallow canal. From this it may be
presumed that if he was in a small boat
with Uhlberg, it was not by his volun
tary act.
The half-filled whisky flask found in
his coat pocket adds some to the mys
tery â¢ as Kreling never drank whisky.
When the body was found the coat was
buttoned, as it was the custom of the de
ceased to wear it. If robbery was the
motive of his taking off it is hardly to
be supposed that the thugs would have
AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
for the old man since 1594. The assertion
that he was wealthy is denied by her.
"Mr. Kreling once had considerable
money," she stated yesterday, Vbut he
lost nearly all of it through, litigation
with members of his family. He intended
to go East to sell the original Kreling
homestead near Prospect Park. Brooklyn,
N. Y. The day before he disappeared he
inquired at the Santa Fe office for a
ticket, but could not come to terms. Fri
day afternoon he told me that he intend
ed to leave the next day and said he had
his ticket in his inside pocket, although
we have been unable to locate the office
where he purchased it."
So far as known Kreling was last seen
alive at the California Cafe between 9
and 10 o'clock Saturday morning, a week
ago. From that time his relatives have
been unable to get a trace of his move
ments.
The officials of the Berkeley branch
Morgue are of the opinion that Mr. Kre
ling came to his death from accident. The
wound on* his head is only a slight abra
sion of the skin, such as might have been
caused by the body coming in contact
with the piling of a wharf or where it
beat upon the sands. Deputy Coroner
Streightiff said yesterday that there were
no marks on the body which indicated
violence. : ':? , *,;
Â¦ "I had the body carefully examined,
said Mr. Streightiff, "and there are some
marks where the body beat upon the
pands before it was taken from the water.
There are no other marks and the vio
lence theory cannot stand. I am still of
the opinion that Mr. Kreling was in the
boat which was seen flying signals of dis
tress off West Berkeley on Saturday. I
have used every "endeavor to trace that
boat, but without result."
The Inquest will be held to-day.

Babbitt was touched for ten hits by the
Dudes, but only four runs were netted.
In the first inning Hammond earned the
initial bag by an honest hit and found no
difliculty in squaring things when Hardle
soaked the Bpheroid to far right for three
bases. Old "Pop" was pushed across the
rubber on a single to center field by Dun
leavy. In the fifth inning Hutchinson
swatted the ball to center and ornamented
the initial base. Hardie, who hit safely,
pave him the tip to advance two bags.
Then there was error feasting by McHale
and "Hutch" crossed the plate. The
fourth and last run was added in the
eighth. Dunleavy worked a three-bagger
off Babbitt and scored on Lange's liner
through the pitcher. The score:

NOTHING COULD
STOP THE BLUE
DOG OF CURTIS
Beacon Wins the Open Stake
Handily in the Best
of Company.
Crawford Lad Proves the Bunner-XTp
After a Great Day's Coursing
* on the Union Park
Field.
There was no greyhound in the stake
at Union Coursing Park yesterday that
could extend Curtis & Son's blue dog
Beacon. He showed more speed than any
dog he met and among these were a num
ber of the fastest greyhounds on the
coast. He first disposed of Rock Island
King, shutting him out pointless. He
then retired Hot Haste, Palo Alto, Ireland
and Vulcan, his kennel mate, in a bye
course, and in the deciding course R. E.
de B. Lopez's great dog Crawford Lad.
This was the longest course of the day,
the score being 16 to 5. Beacon, showed the
speed throughout a great working course,
all of which was done immediately in
front of the grand stand. Crawford Lad
was tryinc all the time, but the best he
could do was to score off the turns made
by Beacon.
; In the fourth round Crawford Lad de
feated Flying Fox, which had been in
stalled favorite at odds of 2'/a to 1. The
course was a pretty one, the Lad just get
ting the turn, after which he outworKed
the San Jose dog: The latter had a nar
row escape in tne previous round, when
he met .r'or Glory. She showed speed
over him, but he ran her down anu In
jured her in a bumping match.
Recording Angel ran three courses with
Joe Farreli on Saturday before it was de
cided which was the winner. She re
peated the performance yesterday with
Ked Hind, the only ldifference being that
the latter was returned the winner at the
third attempt. Palo Alto turned the tables
en Master Clalr, making a show of the
black and white dog. Palo -Alto led by
seven lengths and the farther they went
the greater the gap between them be
came. Palo Alto then defeated Honor
Bright, but struck his colors to the invin
cible, all-conquering Beacon in the suc
ceeding round. He was placed on the
hare once but could not retain his ad
vantage. His kennel mate was retired in
the next round, by Beacon. Ireland had
previously met Vulcan and had defeated
him by a score of 3 to 2. This would have
been 'an undecided course but for a cu
rious act of Ireland's. He caught the
hare, making the score 2 to 2. He then
released it and almost immediately killed,
winning by a margin of one point.
The day was all that could be desired
for coursing after the blustering weather
of Saturday. The detailed results, with
Judge John Grace's official scores, follow:

THE good fortune to haye one's song
exploited and sung by one of the
most popular comedians and sing
ers does not fall, to the lot of ; the

There is an exception, however, in the
case of ; John |F. Cooney of this city/, who
has but lately finished a new song which
has' been accepted Carroll. Johnson of
West's Minstrel ; Jubilee, which opens at
the- Columbia Theater . this evening.
A few days ago.Cooney sent Johnson a
copy.' of the work; and upon- the arrival of
the comedian in this 'city yesterday he at
once set about to secure a proper orches
tration of the song and local theatergoers
will no doubt soon have an opportunity to
hear this song, which - Johnson says is
the biggest thing turned out by a sons
writer in years.
. Cooney is a well . known â¢ and popular
young man of.: this city, and his many
friends will be: glad to learn of his good
fortune. It is proposed to sing the sonÂ«
in connection with the first part of the
minstrel programme, thus giving the en

opportunity to assist In the rendition, of

UNION BUILDERS NOT
AFRAID OF A LOCKOUT
They View With Equanimity the
Threatened Action of the Master
Builders.
To-day was the time set for the threat
ened lockout of the Master Builders' As
sociation, but it does not seem likely to
arrive as per schedule. In fact, the build-
Ing trades care but little whether the
members of the association declare a lock
out or not, for they say the work the dis
contented control is too Email to be con
sidered seriously.
The Master Builders' Association is. a
new organization made up of a few build
ers, who seceded from the Builders' .i Ex
change an<lÂ» the Builders' Association
after those two organizations adopted the
new schedule of wages and certain regu
lations regarding the membership of fore
men in the various building trades unions.
The seceders refused to recognize the
new union scale and refused to entertain
the idea of unionizing the foremen, so as
all the other builders accepted the new
order of things the objectors started to
form] an organization all their ; own. ' It
was announced that : they would declare
a lockout of all-union men on their Jobs
to-day, but the announcement has caused
no more than passing comment among
the building trades. â¢
"The principal builders of the city are
all in the Builders' Exchange or in the
Builders' Association," said P. H. Mc-
Carthy, president of the Building Trades
Council yesterday, "and It should, be un
derstood that with those two organiza
tions the building trades unions are In
perfect harmony. This Master Builders'
Association is formed of men who left the
two other organizations and It" is only
necessary for people to understand that
in what they do they have not the sup
port of the Builders' Exchange or the
Builders' Association."
Should the threat of the new organiza
tion be carried out It cannot amount to
anything more than a. ripple on the sur
face. Locking out builders [Is not , like
locking out men who work In a shop. In
the shops it would probably stop the
work, but with the builders the discon
tented bosses can do no more than keep,
union men away from the contracts
that they control. According to the union
men the whole of the new organization
does not control $25,000 worth of work, and
at least $19,000 of this Is In one contract
already near completion. Â¦ ,
and several other high-class runners.
Over 600 thoroughbreds are training at
Churchill Downs. Lieutenant Gibson
owned by Charles H. Smith of Chicago,
worked a mile and an eighth with 115
pounds up in 1:56 this morning. He went
the mile In 1:412-5, which is the fastest
work done at the track this spring.

His Bullet Finds the Heart of the Bird at the Annual
Eagle Shoot at Shell Mound Park.
JOHN OLDAG IS SHOOTING
KING OF THE RED MEN
STOCKTON WINS
TWO GAMES OUT
OF THE SERIES
Ragged Ball Played by the
Dudes in the Afternoon
Match.
Lockhead of Stockton Distinguishes
Himself b7 Brilliant Fielding
and Stick Work and
Breaks a Leg.
Stockton S. Oakland 1
The game at Recreation Park yesterday
efternoon was baseball at times. A vic
tory in the morning in their native burs
had filled the heart* of the Dudes with a
debilitating' happiness and when the after
noon caxne they forgot where they were
and committed every brea.cn of baseball
eticjuette iv the code.
Oakland did not lose the game because
her btick-wieJders were unable to find
Harper. Eleven times his curves were
untwisted, but then the Stockton team did
not revel in a pile of moth-eaten errors,
four cf which were registered by "Oom
Paul" Laiige. who wouid better eacriflce
his whiskers, as they seem to affect u:a
borne pretty fielding, especially by
Lockntaa, who ir.tt w;t!Â» an unfortunate
aeeiceiu in the eolith, was the teature of
the guine. Tne score was so cne-tide<i as
to otrtract interest In the result.
Three Stocktonians pedaled the rubber
the hrst rattle cut oi the box. McHale
walked to Urst on a quartet of bails, steal
ing second with grace ajui precision.
Courtney took a ball on his spine and
first base at the same time. Pace's out
advanced both runners a bag and a two
base hit by L*)ckhead sent them home.
A single by BaLbitt to left Held and a bit
of Indecision by Moskimaa enabled Lock
head to score.
Full of trmgy, btwhSskered errors was
the Xirst part of the third inning, which
added four runs to the Stockton list.
Lockhead and JJabbitt went to the bags
on hits, advancing a station on ii passed
ball. Lockhcad scored on Morrow's out,
liabbitt following across the rubber on an
f rror by fitjÂ»*rÂ«nÂ«, Then Selna and Moore
found themselves on the bags and they
were pushed over the plate by a double
from Mcllaie's bat. Bteffanl was not hit
ega.in during the game, for Mosniman
took his place in the box in the next inn-
Ing. Ueviil going to center field and Dua
leavy to left.
The fourth chopped the ice for the
Dudes. Francks forgot himself and shook
the stick for a hit, ttole second and went
to third on Mos=k:man's out, scoring on
Langes hit to left.
In the sixth Courtney was presented
â¢with first bus through the kindness of
Bevill, who dropped a quiet, easy, unde
monstrative fly ball. Then Pace drove the
spheroid against the score board and
Courtney scored. The prettiest fielding of
the day occurred in this inning. Francks
drove a high hot liner over Lockhead's
head, but the latter pulled it down with
his right, making a semi-circle turn.
Hardir-, who was on first, was doubled.
It v.as a phenomenal catch, in the sev
Â«-nth Moore scored for Stockton, being
fce'.pf-d along by a couple of errors.
After a most brilliant exhibition of base-
Vail both in the field and with the stick.
Lockhead. the Stockton shortstop, met
with an accident in the eighth inning that
Â¦will incapacitate him from participation
in the diamond sport for many months.
While fielding a ball from "Pop" Hardies
bat he collided with Courtney, who covers
the left territory for Stockton, breaking
his left leg between the ankle and knee.
When the accident occurred Lockhead
Â¦was really in Courtney's territory.
Through eagerness and keen interest in
the game he took what was a very diffi
cult chance and would have caught the
tall were it not for the collision. Both
players came together with terrific force
and rolled over on the ground, the ball
between them. Lockhead, his mind on
the play, despito the Injury which he had
received, arose from the ground and threw
the ball to third to head off the runner.
Hardly had the ppheroid left his hands
when he ff-11 writhing in pain. Soon after
he was removed to the Receiving Hospi
tal. wr*>re his leg was *=et. He was taken
to Stockton on the late afternoon train.
Lockhead is a resident of Stockton and
one of the best players in the league.
Last srason he was East, in the big
league, but failing to secure an engage
ment this season, he signed with Stock
ton.
The score:

GOOD COURSING
WAS THE RULE
AT INGLESIDE
Tea Rose Captured the Final
With Golden Rule as
Runner Up.
The New Dog Overture Made a Satia
factbiy Showing and "Was Only
Beaten Out by the Stake .
Winner.
The patrons of Ingleslde Coursing Park
were treated to a good programme yester
day in the finals of the open stake. Tea
Rose won the deciding course with Golden
Rule as runner up. The latter dog showed
up well all day and won his courses after
hard runs.
Considerable interest was shown in the
imported dog Overture and the newcomer
made a good impression.' The general
opinion is in his favor and many coursing
men predict that after rounding up to
form Overture will hold with the cracka
jacks. He certainly showed up well in
the last stake. McKinley and Benlcla Boy
furnished an interesting course in the
third tie. A hare full of ginger was
turned loose and kept well in the lead of
the dogs. Two relief dogs were turned
loose and the hare took them all over the
field before a kill was scored. The course
was too grueling for McKinley and he

HEART DISEASE
Some Facts Regarding' the Rapid In-
crease of Heart Trouble,
Â¦
Heart trouble, at least among . the
Americans, la certainly increasing an'!
while this may be largely due to the ex-
citement and worry of American business
life. It is more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease Is Incurable; but
not one case In a hundred of heart trou-
ble is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
( and poor digestion is because both or-
gans are controlled by the same great
nerves, the Sympathetic and the Pneu-
mogastric.
In another way also the heart Is af-
fected by the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the chest
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart and lungs, interfering
with their action: hence arises palpita-
tion and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and
to Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use af-
ter meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be
found at drug stores, and which contain
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular, per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
at meal times will cure any form of stom-
ach trouble except cancer of the stom-
ach.

EAGLE KING JOHN OLDAG.
JOHN OLDAG is the "Schuetzen
King" of the Red Men Schuetzen
Company for the present year. He
won the title and the honors that go
with it yesterday at the annual eagle
shoot which took place at Shell Mound.
; The whole company was there with their
i families and friends. Those who cared
i not for marksmanship enjoyed themselves
: in the dancing pavilionâ for the organiza
! tion gave a picnic as well â or lunched in
the arbors of the park. The main attrac
tion, however, was the prize contest for
the shooters.
The '-'eagle" was a large wooden repre
sentative of the noble bird at the top of
a large pole on the bay shore. It was so
made that wings, legs and other parts of
its anatomy came down separately on be
ing struck by a bullet. Early in the day
the whole company lined up in uniform
for an opportunity to secure a prize, and
ere the last piece, the breast, came down !
several hundred pounds of lead had been
dropped into the bay. The bird was a
tough old fowl, for it would not disinte
grate easily.
At last John Oldag's bullet found the
vital spot in the breast, and by the time
it reached the ground the new king was
picked up bodily, seated in a chair, which
was placed upon a table, and the company's i
monarch was carried into the pavilion on I
the shoulders of biff, cheering marksmen, j
There \V. Kreutskamm introduced the
king and presented him with the kingly
modal and several shining pieces of
noney, with which the recipient made his
subjects merry in .the proper way. Cap
tain H. Grieb, the! retiring king, made a
few remarks and presented the "king's
j belt." or sash, and the wreath. Then the
( king talked and everybody cheered, for j
I the king said "Was trinken sle?" The
prizewinners Jn their order were the fol
lowing:
King prize, eagle's breast, John Oldau; first
prize, crown, W. Dressier; second prize, scep
ter, JaVk Mohr; third prize, apple, H. Grleb;
fourth prize, ring, Henry Schulz; fifth prize,'
I head. C. Becker; plxth prize, neck. G. Wagner;
i seventh prize, right claw, C. 'Oldagr; eighth \
! prize left claw, I). Wolpern; ninth prize, right j
j wing, C. Bolsdorf; tenth prize, left wing, 11.
! Melsner; eleventh prize, tail. H. Bach.
The success of the whole affair was due
to the management of the committee,
composed of W. Kreutskamm, Captain H.
Grieb, H. Bach, A. Tamke, C. Stein and
John Oldag.
There were plenty of other shooting
clubs on the range and the attendance was
large. A few good scores were made, but
a gusty wind prevented much fine work.
The San Francisco Sehuetzen Vereln
started out yesterday with a clean sheet,
the monthly medal contest being the ini
tial shoot of the present season. The
club has been reclasslfled and new medals
are up for competition, the conditions be
ing the same as heretofore, 20 shots, 25
ring target. Annexed are the high' scores:Cathedral Council Outing.
The officers of the Cathedral Council
No. C 9, Young Men's Institute, are al
ready preparing for their annual outing,
to be held on Saturday, May IS. The af
fair will be In charge of the following
committee: P. F. McCarthy. D. C. Deasy
J. D. Mahoney. F. J. Gonzales, C. Beards
ley. P. J. Farrell. T. P. Martin. L. A.
Kelly. W. P. Kecgh and E. J. Dallard.
LARGE CROWD ATTENDS
OPENING OF EL CAMPO
Barring a few fights and numerous
wordy wars, the reopening . of Â¦El Campo
yesterday was devoid of excitement. The
pretty pleasure resort attracted" nearly
5000 people to its confines, and every one
but the few unfortunates who missed the
last boat home are happy In the belief
that they had an enjoyable outing. The
day was an ideal one, the music furnished
by Blum's orchestra air that could be de
sired and the dancing pavilion floor Just
smooth enough for dancing.
The rough element was outnumbered
by the more orderly 'class, but this did not
deter the former from "cutting up," as Is
their usual wont. The three policemen In
attendance had a comparatively easy
time, however, holding the hoodlums in
subjection. No arrests were made and
not one man was hit with a club.. Withal,
the crowd was a good-natured one and
was out to have a good time. In this
they succeeded, as the spacious grounds
afforded many opportunities for quiet en
joyment. Many danced until the Ukiah's
whistle warned them that It was'time to
depart, : while others boated and fished In
the smooth stretch of water which sur
rounds the resort.

PROMPT WORK SAVED
ADJOINING PROPERTY
Fire Department Confined a Big Blaze
to One Building and Prevented
a Disastrous Fire.
A costly conflagration was nipped Jn the
bud pesterdajr morning by the prompt and
Â«-nergotic work of Chief Sullivan and his
men. Fire broke out about 9:30 o'clock in
the planing mills of Noach & Kitchen, at
r:4 Fifth street, and for a short space of
time threatened to destroy the inflam
mable pro;>erty in its immediate vicinity.
Cbtef Sullivan, appreciating the danger to
Furrounding property, turned In a second
alarm from box IS6, and more men were
Â»<oon on the scene and battling with the
fiameF. Within an incredibly short space
of time the lire was got under control,
end the adjoining properties were only
damaged by smoke and water.
Leopold H. Birth, whose planing mill
at 705 Bryant street is In back of the
burned Ftructure, discovered the fire and
turned in an alarm from his auxiliary box.
The shavings and dry wood stored in
Noach & Kitchen's mill burned like tin
der, and in a short time the building was
a mas=B of flames. The firemen fought the
fire from all flo^s and flooded the interior
with water. They also made great efforts
to prevent the spread of the flames, and
In this they succeeded.
The building adjoining. 514 Fifth street,
Â¦which was occupied by J. G. Klemm. a
cabinet-maker. Fred Krajewekl and C. O.
Schnoor, was slightly damaged by the
flames, and Its contents by smoke and
wator.
The origin of the fire Is unknown, but
it Is thought to have started through the
carelessnfcss of one of the employes' use
of matches. All losses are covered by in
mrance. The buildings are owned by F.
Korbel & Uros., and were also insured. â¢
About five years ago fire started in the
same block and consumed nearly a block
<if bui!ding>= before the flames could be
checked. Fortunately the fire yesterday
was quickly discovered, and as no wind
was blowing, further loss was prevented.
NEW RAILWAY FOR
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
J. F. Thompson of Eureka Believes It
Will Be the Nucleus of a Trans
continental Line.
J. F. Thompson, proprietor of the Hum
boldt Dally Standard, has been a jruest at
the Grand Hotel for the past two days
and will leave for Eureka this morning.
Mr. Thompson, who Is also Receiver of
the Land Office at Eureka, In enthusiastic
regarding the building of a new railway to
be known as the Canlfornla Northern,
which he believes will be the nucleus of a
coast line from San Francisco to Port
land, Or., and ultimately connect with the
San Francisco and North Pacific road at
Ukiah in one transcontinental road.
"A large amount of capital is behind
this project," eaid Mr. Thompson. "The
California Northern will run from Eureka
to Arcata and join the Mad River road,
connecting the latter point with Kerbel.
Surveys have been made to continue the
road to Crescent City, Del Norte County.
By the addition of other small spurs a
through line will be had between Crescent
City and Ukiah.
"The road is bound to do a large busi
ness, for it will tap the richest redwood
section in the world, situated In Del
Norte. Humboldt and Mendocino coun
ties. The enormous total of 100,000,000,000
feet of standing redwood lumber is con
tained in that section. With the connec
tion of the Eel River. Mad River, Califor
nia Northern and Donahue roads, the
products of this rich country will be
brought to the very door of Eureka, which
has the only harbor in those parts. I
look for a through line from San Fran
cisco to Portland and then across the con
tinent."

tion with the nomination. He declined,
however, to say whether he would accept
if the honor were conferred upon him, on
the ground that he could not accept or
decline anything that had not been of
fered to him.
O'Farrell street, near Fillmore, on Tues
day evening. .
was Palm Sunday, and
\f the day was fittingly observed at all
II the Catholic churches; in the city.
Branches of the palm and olive trees
were distributed to the faithful after they
had been blessed at the service of high
mass, and they were held by the members
of the congregations till the close of serv
ice as a symbol of devotion. The palma
were then taken home, and are to be kept
in the house for a whole year, so that God
will bless the dwellings in which the
branches are preserved.
The services at St. Mary's' Cathedral
were most impressive at the 10:30 o'clock
mass. The congregation was invited to
approach the high altar, where the
branches were distributed by the priests.
No sermon was preached, as is usual at
tliis mass, but the Passion was read . in
its place, the congregation all standing.
In the afternoon the Calvarian Society
held its last lenten devotion at the ca
thedral. After the devotion of the Way
of the Cross, made by the Rev. Father
Dempsey, an eloquent sermon was
preached by the Rev. .Father Charles A.
llamm. He made the subject of his ser
mon a description of the two processions,
the first being the triumphant entry of
Jesus into Jerusalem and the second be
ing our Lord on his way to Calvary. The
reverend father gave a vivid description
of Jerusalem at the time of the cruci
fixion. He then passed over the eventful
Friday when Christ was before Pilate. He
used the subject of Palm Sunday as a
modern lesson that people of to-day were
one day serving God and figuratively
bearing palms, but that suddenly they
would change their minds and cry "Cru
cify Him."
The services commenced at St. Ignatius
Church in honor of the day at the 10:30
service. The palms were blessed by the
Rev. Father F. Allen, after which a pro
cessions followed, with clergy and sanctu
ary boys, round the sacred edifice, dur
ing which the proper anthems were sung
by the choir. Aftr this low mass was
celebrated. The Passion was read by the
Rev. Father Frieden.
The sacrament of confirmation was ad
ministered yesterday afternoon to over 200
children of St. Brendan's parish by the
Right Rev. Bishop Thomas Grace of Sac
ramento. The service began by the con
gregation singing the "Stabat Mater."
His Grace then followed with a short ad
dress to the confirmation candidates. He
said in cart:
"The sacrament you are about to re-
celve Is tho same that St. Peter and St.
John administered to the people in- the
early history of the church: What you
should pray for is wisdom to teach you
savationat its true worth, and not love
for the treasures of the world. You are
marked on the forehead with the sign of
the cross as a sign that you openly take
up the cross and profess Christ. See that
you are never afraid to deny- him."
All the boys who were confirmed also
took the League of the Cross pledge to
abstain from liquor and not to enter a
saloon until they were 21 years of age.
Those who received the sacrament were:
Edward Patrick Hanlon, Edwin Joseph Bun

GASHIE STEIN
AS A DEALER IN
CANNED FRUITS
His Methods and Prices
Caused Suspicion -and
Arrests.
Bob Ellis and William Daly Charged
With Grand Larceny for the Way
.They Secured the Stock
in Trade.
Â»
Gashie Stein, of counterfeiting memory,
is again bringing himself into unpleasant
notoriety, this time as a- dealer in canned
fruit. He has lately been among the
wholesalers offering fruit, canned by the
California Fruit Canning Company, â¢ in
lots of from fifty cases up to 2&X), and at
prices amounting to about half what the
company was charging. There was no
doubt of the genuineness of the goods he
offered, and merchants marveled at his
enterprise. The canning .company- heard
of Stein's offer and decided to investigate,
and the case was placed in the hands of
the Morse agency.
Captain Callundan and Detective Green
were put upon the case, and they soon,
found that the fruit Gashie was offering
on such alluring terms was furnished
him by "Bob" Ellis, and that Ellis got it
from William Daly, who is in the employ
of the canning company. Both Ellis and
Daly are now under arrest on charges of
grand larceny.
Saturday evening the detectives watch
ed the canning company's warehouse on
the corner of Ninth and Brennan streets,
and Just after it closed they saw
Ellis back a wagon up to tho
curb and commence to load cases
of canned peaches aboard. He put
on fifty and then started away, the
detectives following until he arrived at
Stein's place at 404Vfe Sixth street, where
he put them off. Then he was arrested.
Ellis would not say much, but Stein vol
unteered the information that when the
yearly stock taking was over at the
warehouse it was found that 3000 cases of
canned fruit had been overlooked, and
that this was the property of Daly. It
was this lot of 3000 cases, he said, he was
selling. He could not say, however, how
the overlooking of the 3UOO cases had the
effect of transfering them to Daly's ac
count.
As soon as Ellis was behind the bars
the detectives started after Daly, and at
2 o'clock yesterday morning they found
him entering his home at 184 Perry street.
Ellis has been in trouble before, and
Daly is an ex-volunteer, who came home
with the First Californias. The stealing
for which they have been arrested has
been going on for some months;* in fact,
until the underselling by Stein threatened
to work a serious harm in prices for
canned fruit.
DISCUSSES THE
FUTURE OF THE
NEGRO RACE
Interesting Meeting Held by
the Society of Ethical
Culture.
Prominent Speakers Take the Stand
That Only by Liberal Education
Will the Black Man Be
Improved.
NEW YORK. April S.â The future of the
negro race w&a The subjtt-t of discussion
at Carnegie Hall to-day before the So
ciety of Ethical Culture. William H.
Baldwin Jr.. president of the IÂ»ng Island
Railroad; Professor Felix Adler and Isaac
Fehr and Robert W. Taylor, two grad
ual es of the Tuskepee (Ala.) school, were
the (speakers. All ppoke hopefully of the
nÂ«Â«ro'p future and found a solution of
. \:s:!r.g: problems in industrial education.
Mr. Baldwin said the present conditions
involved in the future of the negro race
are the social relations of black and
uhiiÂ«>. the richts of the blacks, the labor
religious and nunU training: of the blacks;
the abuse of the negro and the some-
Umea mooted question of how to get rid
of the nogro as a whole by amalgamation
or deportation. All these questions are
Included in the main question of the gen
eral education of the negro.
The speaker heldthat the fine distinc-
Uons between black and white in the
South are proper and beyond criticism.
Ke:Â«-rring to the question of labor, he said
t was the only solution of the troubles
in the South. A nepro and a mule, he ac
kTiowledged, are the only combination
I bat can grow cotton and consequently are
t :-semiaJ to the welfare of the South. The
:Â¦ ligiona and moral welfare of the black
and white in the South could only be se
i ured by industrial education.
Referring to the abuses of the negro,
Mr. Baldwin eaid there was never any
complaint of the moral integrity of the
negro of the South in relation to the
whites before the war. He spoke of 127
lynchings. Latterly, it was not uncom
mon lor negroes to be lynched for crimes
other than the only one that could by
Â¦any possibility justify it, A cure for
lynching could be found In two waysâal
ways to give matters of a criminal assault
the right of way in the courts, and, sec
ondly, to compel the community in which
the lynchings occur to pay a fixed sum to
the family of the victim.
"The fifteenth amendment to the con
stitution of the United States," he said,
"cost a million lives to enact. As many
more stand ready to maintain It. The
fault is not in the amendment, but the
suffrage right should be equal to black
and white. The negro stands ready for
tducational or property qualifications, if
the same qualifications be enforced for
white men. It is a general question of
education for the whites and blacks."
llr. Baldwin spoke of the refining influ
ences of schools like the Hampton Insti
tute and Tuekegee school. An industrial
education that would elevate but not un
fit him for the only path that was open
to him is the only solution of the many
problems prtsentt-d.
Isaac Fisher told of his graduation from"
Tuskept-e and of his call to the Schofield
School of Aiken. S. C. He provoked much
laughter by his descriptions of the condi
tions he found there.
Ilobert \V. Taylor said that when he
first went to Tuskegee his ambition was
to go to Congress and help to enact laws
for the benefit of his race. Under the
teachings of the school he soon learned
that the salvation of the negro can come
through no law but the law of labor.
The hope of the race as of the South
in general. Mr. Taylor found, is tn the
c-.iucation of the children. In Alabama, he
said, the cost of education of the chil
dren in the cities averages $15 a head; the
â¢Â¦ducation of the children in the country
districts SO cents a head is the allowance.
To that miscalculation is due much of the
mlserjr and ipnuranrc of the South.

MOSES AND HIS
FIRST IDEAS OF
THE PHILIPPINES
He Prepared an Article
for the University
Chronicle.
Since the California Commissioner
Refuses to Talk Now, His Opin
ions Before Appointment
Become Interesting.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 8.
There was a time when -Professor Ber
nard Moses was more talkative about his
ideas of the Philippines. That was before
Professor Moses became a member of the
new Philippine Commission. When he
was plain professor, without official titles
and dignity, he was more Inclined to tell
his views as to our duties regarding the
troublesome islands. In those days he
wrote several articles and delivered ad
dresses upon the subject. In the absence
of any oniclai utterances from Professor
Moses now, the following article written
by him and published in the University
Chronicle, the olllcial organ of the State
University, last December, is of Interest:
When a nation rises by military or po
litical achievements to greater political
importance among nations of the world.
mt-iniers of foreign nations instinctively
ancribe to its learning, literature and gen
eral culture a new and increased impor
tance. And when a nation declines in
power and loses its j>.>liiu-aJ jTcstiee. theru
is Inevitably a falling off in the world's
regard for the hither elements of Its civ
ilization. â¢ * â¢ â¢
It may be true that within the limits of
our ancient territory we have the means
of accumuiatlr.c all the wealth we need.
It may be true that we have no need of
much that the Orient may teach: but it
is not to be supposed that the last thou
sand years of Oriental experience is en
tirely without profitable lessons, for even
the American nation. As the neighbor of
the Chinese -In the Orient, it is hoped that
this nation may acquire somewhat of their
respect for power to ornament the strong
and healthful manifestation or' our spirit.
If as It retards our cultivation or ppirit
uai life, we have little need of the Orient,
the Orient has need of us. Charity, a
proper recognition of human worth, re
gard for woman, a determination to let
Justice rule, political libertyâ these are some
cf the achievements of our race, come of
the positive results of a long course of
social development. Of these the Orient
has need. They may be accepted by any
nation without doing- violence to the race
ideas on which the civilization of that na
ticn refts; and in carrying these principles
of a higher civilization to the islander* of
the Pacific there is a certain excuse for
our zeal and a compensation for our re
sponsibilities.
These and other ideas for which our so
ciety stajuds are assumed to be worth the
effort it costs to realize them in life, for it
is assumed that in them is the seed of a
higher civilization. That these ideas may
be carried forward for the betterment of
the less advanced portions of the human
race it is a certain justification of the power
and dominion held by the nations of Eng
lish etock. Wherever the dominion of any
branch of the English people has established
Itself hitherto a higher and progressive form
of civilization has been instituted. This
fact Cives ground for the exi>ectation that
the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands
will ultimately derive advantage from be
ing brought under the sovereignty of the
United States.
One of the important items in this advan
tage will oonnlst In the fact that ultimately
these islanders, if they Justify the most
hopeful thoughts concerning them, will,
with such limitations of suffrage as may
seem exDTdient. have part in a great Fed
eral government, whose traditions are the
traditions of freedom and toleration, and
whope power will be sufficient to establish
security and peace as the conditions of
progress and prosperity: for the Federal
g-overnment is the only form of govern
ment under which widely separated com
munities, Individually Incapable of defend
lnr themselves against the machinations
of great stater, can be rendered secure in
the "enjoyment of the advantages of power
and liberty. In the words of President
Schurman of the UnitÂ«*d States Philippine
Commlpslon. "Our tutelage, at least for
some time, is the only thin? that can save
the Filipinos from despotism and anarchy
and their island? from a division among the
European powers, thus' destroying forever
the hope of a free and self -governing Fili
pino nationality." Under the sovereignty of
the Federal republic of the United States
tht way is open to these Islanders to be
come self-governing communities, and. if
their development will Justify it. to become,
through representatives, participants In the
larger affairs of the national Government.
Under th*> sovereignty of the United States
the power of the United States Is In their
service to preserve internal peace and to
ward off the Invader, thus making possible
the two most Important Immediate alms of
social ambition, namely, the achievement
of s:reat power and the preservation of
liberty.

EMITj ULRICH, a Swiss tanner,
nearly lost his life Saturday night
ln^the '. slimy ooze of Islals Creek,
~: according to \ the story he tells of
his terrible~ r experience. He visited friends
in South â¢ San Francisco Saturday Â¦ and
started to return to his lodgings on Fol
som street after dark. He lost his bear
ings and strayed into the Mission mud
flats near Craig's tannery, where the mire
aside from being soft and deep, has the
additional quality of being saturated, with
tannery refuse. .
Ulricn was up to his waist In the mud
before he attempted to retrace his iteps,
then his efforts were futile, for the more
he, squirmed the deeper he sank. There
seemed to be no bottom to the bed of
slime, which, gradually sucked the unfor-
tunate man down into its disgusting
depths.
Gradually be sank to bis arm pits, then
his shoulders became submerged and
finally all that remained above the sur
face of the mud was the man's. head and
he had to compress his lips to keep the
slime from choklnp him.
He says he remained In this precarious
situation until dawn yesterday morning
when by a superhuman effort he managed
to extricate himself and crawl to the tan
nery, where he fell exhausted and re
mained until discovered by Officer Porter
some hours later.
The rays of the sun had dried the mud
on his clothing until it was almost as
hard as cement, and he was unable to
move a limb * until his outer garments
were cut off him. He was treated at the
City and County Hospital.

STANDARD FIXED
FOR FRUITS OF
THE OIL SANDS
Southern California Works
Out Problem for the
Derrick Men.
Shasta County Has Taken Up Quest
for Petroleum and Will Sink
Wells Within a Short TimÂ©
in New Territory.
The question of what constitutes a
proper classification of oil has been set
tled, so far as the Los Angeles Oil Ex
change can settle It." That body has Just
adopted the report of a special committee,
which practically does away with the dif
ferent degrees of gravity, so far as the
Los Angeles local field is concerned, and
classifies the oil entirely as to its purity.
The average gravity In the Los Angeles
field Is UVi degrees and It ranges from
12 to IS degrees. The reason assigned for
this basis of classification Is that the
great bulk of crude oil purchased between
12 and 18 degrees gravity is used as a
fuel oil. varying little in character except
as to the gravity. All crude petroleum,
between 12 and 18 degrees, is graded into
four classes, as follows: No. 1. contain
ing not to exceed 3 per cent water or sedi
ment; No. 2, containing not to exceed 10
per cent water or sediment; No. 3, con
taining not to exceed 20 per cent water or
sediment Any grade containing above 20
per cent of water or sediment will be
graded as No. 4. No special difference in
the full value of petroleum could be dis
covered between tne gravities of 12 and
lb degrees Baume. To ascertain the
amount of water and sediment the gaso
line test was adopted. This teat is as
follows: From 50 to 100 parts of crude oil
have added to them 50 or 100 parts of
gasoline, which are well shaken to com
bine them and are then submitted to a
temperature not lower than 60 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the precipitation during
twenty-four hours will indicate the classi
fication.
The striking news of the In the oil
field, so far as it indicates the general be
lief of the prospectors that there is oil
"from Siskiyou to San Diego and from the
Sierras to the sea," comes from Shasta
County. A company has been formed in
that county and a tract of. land of 1140
acres has come under the control of the
incorporators. In townships 32 and 33
north and range 3 west, being contiguous
to Stinking Canyon. Of this considerable
tract 240 acres were located, 480 acres al
ready patented were leased and 320 acres
were purchased from the railroad com
pany at $5 per acre. E. S. Watson, who
has investigated the matter, tells the In
vestors that he believes that if oil exists
in that section at all It will be found in a
belt covering all of fifty sections.
New oil companies since the last record
have filed articles of incorporation in the
office of the Secretary of State at Sacra
mento as follows: Ophlr Oil and Develop
ment Company of Fresno: Empire Oil
and Development Company of Bakers
field; Lord Roberts Oil Company of Han
ford, Kings County; Porterville Oil and
Mining Company of Porterville, Tulare
County. The extent to which the Califor
nia oil industry has succeeded in attract
ing attention abroad Is indicated by the
fact that the Fullerton Consolidated,
Southern Consolidated and Arroyo Grande
Oil companies have arranged to open an
office in London. The Los Angeles Times
says that one of the oil companies that
has wells In that city has a considerable
clientage abroad and that every mall
brings letters from France. Holland or
Germany. The leading oil paper of Lon
don gives considerable space to California
oil. Two new companies have been listed
on the Los Angeles Oil Exchange, the Los
Angeles Oil and Transportation Company
and the Oceanic Oil Company.
O. A. Ivers of Los Angeles has taken a
lease from the Chaffee estate in Ventura
County of a tract of 1123 acres of oil land.
An oil company has been formed at Ox
nard to prospect for oil on a tract of 1400
acres north of Saugus.
The Contra Costa Gazette gives Infor
mation that the Williamson place of 4SO
acres, in Contra Costa County, has been
bonded by an Eastern oil company's rep
resentative. Charles Gilbert has been
prospecting on the ranch of F. A. Hyde,
and there are other prospectors who have
been making their headquarters at the
Black Diamond. iÂ«
The Ventura Petroleum Mining Com
pany has leased 160 acres five miles north
of Piru City, Ventura County, and the
lease will run fifteen years.
Four oil companies were recently incor
porated in Los Angeles in one day. One
of these had capital stock of $30,000 with
$25 subscribed, and another a capital stock
of $250,000 with $35 subscribed. This pro
vokes the Los Angeles Herald's oil man
to remark: "This looks rather dispropor
tionate, but It is much more honest than
In the case of some ambitious corpora
tions which are incorporated for a big
amount of money, most of which la paid
upâ on paperâ such, for Instance, as the
company referred to in this department
last week, incorporated for a million dol
lars and selling: at par, while the direc
tors subscribed to half the capital stock
after chipping in $30 apiece. The trouble is
that the mass of the investing or specu
lating public pay very little attention to
these questions. They fail to perceive
that stock In a company incorporated for
$100,000 and selling at 25 cents a share is
400 per cent cheaperâ other things being
equalâ than stock in another company in
corporated for a million dollars, which
sells at 10 cents a share. In course of
time, after a few more months have singed
their wings in the oil flame, there will be
more attention paid to these little de
tails."
The Portervllle Oil and Mining Company
has incorporated. The company has a
quarter section of land In the Sunset dls
trist. Kern County..
The Red Bluff Sentinel tells a story con
cerning the way William Clinton of that
town has struck luck. He was prospect
ing for gold and saw oil indications. He
secured forty acres of land for $400. Since
then David Kay, oil operator, has offered
$10,000 for the land.
The Glenn County Oil Company has been
Incorporated at "Willows. The Mclntosh
Coal Oil Company, operating at Ferndale.
Humboldt County, will erect three addi
tional derricks.
The Los- Ajigeles 'Western Graphic
throws stones at San Francisco for or
ganizing wildcat oil companies and says
that Los Angeles has been fortunately ex
empt in that regard. Now the Los Angeles
Herald has this statement, which may be
compared with the one made by the
Graphic, with amusing results: "About
the rawest thing that I have heard of so
far in connection with the exploitation of
oil stocks is the case of a company that
has been widely advertised In -the local
papers. In which a mind reader or
prophet, who Is also widely advertised, is
one of the leading spirits. He advertises
to give all sorts of advice on matters re
lating to business, love or any old thing,
and makes a specialty of advising Intend
ing purchasers of oil stock. When any of
these apply to him for advice as to what
stock they shall buy, after paying their $2
or so he confidentially recommends them
to invest In the company he Is interest
ed in."
Â¦ The oil fever has struck Ukiah and
Monterey. y

TOOK HIS LIFE
OK THE SUMMIT
OF A MOUNTAIN
Unknown Suicide Found in
the Neighborhood of
Glen Park.
Body With a Bullet Wound in the
Breast, Inflicted About Two
Weeks Ago, Taken to
the Morgue.
?
The body of an unknown man, well
dressed and evidently young, was found
on the summit of one of the hills that
surround Glen Park yesterday afternoon
and taken to the I.lorgue. The man had
evidently been the victim of suicide
caused by an unfortunate love affair, but
his identity has not thus far been learned.
The cause of death was a gunshot wound
in the region. of the heart, and judging
from the decomposed condition of the
body, must have been inflicted about two
weeks ago.
Yesterday morning T. Brandhofer, who
resides at. 11 California avenue, and his
nine-year-old son were strolling over the
region In the vicinity of the park when
they became conscious of a foul odor,
and upon investigation found the body.
The Morgue officials were notified and
soon arrived on the scene.
The body Jay upon a coat and nearby
was a pistol which contained one dis
charged cartridge. On the hat was
found an unsigned note, written to a
"Miss M.," stating that the writer would
soon be with his mother and in. her com
pany would watch over the person to
whom the- epistle was addressed. Noth
ing else could be found which would tend
to throw any light on the affair.
The dead man was between 25 and 30
years old. about 5 feet 8 inches In height
with dark hair, brown eyebrows and
moustache and regular features. He
wore a brown Fedora hat, gray checked
coat and vest, black and gray trousers,
lace tan shoes, black and white socks and
gray underwear.

HIT WITH A SANDBAG
AND KNOCKED SENSELESS
Samuel F. Beamish, a Shoemaker,
Bobbed While Hearing His
Home on Birch Avenue.
Samuel F. Beamish, a shoemaker living
at 614 Birch avenue, was on his way
home about 1 o'clock Saturday morning,
and when within a few yards of his house
he was hit on the head with a sandbag
and knocked senseless. A milkman saw
him stretched out on the sidewalk about
an hour later and succeeded In bringing
him back to consciousness. He had been
robbed of between $23 and $25. The cow
ardly ruffian had kicked him in the face
while he was senseless on the ground.
Beamish was drinking in some of thÂ«
corner groceries in the neighborhood and
foolishly displayed his gold. It is sup
posed that the sight of the gold aroused
the cupidity of some one who saw him
and he was followed and robbed The
robbery was reported to the police, but
as Beamish did not see the robber there
is small chance of any arrest being made.

THE EYES OF THE POLICE
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, MONDAY, APKLL 9, 19U0.
POLICE SEEKING
KENNETH DUNCAN,
TIE DEGENERATE
The Once Brilliant Preacher
Again Wanted for Petty
Larceny.
The Denunciation by Professor Robin
son Last Monday Upset Him
and Drove Him to Hard
The police are searching the city for J.
Kenneth Duncan, the degenerate minister
v.-ho was forc*Â»d through his drunken hab
its to tender his resignation of the pulpit
in the Howard Presbyterian Church in
IM<3. It was only last Monday, at a meet
ing of the Presbyterian Union, that Pro
fessor Thomas A. Robinson in a speech
paid: "Some of the ministers, including
Presbyterian preachers who have occu
pied pulpits in San Francisco, are a dis-
Kraco to me civilization of the nineteenth
<entury. A few of thorn have had free
board at the City Prison, and others
should be sent to tne State penitentiary
for a term of years." He thus referred to
ltur.czn: "What right had J. Kenneth
Duncan that vagabond, to occupy the
place or instructor in the house of God?
ile was a demoralized wretch."
Duncan has had many ups and downs
Â«=ince 1^33, ar.d what hf is now wanted for
2>y the police is for stealing a valuable
Â« overcoat ami Dair of shoes from HU Van
Â»ss avenue, where he had been for the
j>ast six or seven weeks employed as a
waiter under the name of Charles Russell,
xvhich he assumed on a former occasion.
About two weeks ago he was recÂ«gnized
by a sister of the landlady, who knew
him in Oakland, and he begged her not to
expose him, as he was again trying to be
cood. After seeing the article in Tues
day's papers In which he was denounced
by i Professor Robinson, he started to
drink again. Saturday night he got his
vajrep. and yesterday he was observed
prowling about the rooms. About 2
o'clock In the afternoon he entered the
room of Harry E. Gates, a dental student,
and stole an overcoat and a pair of patent
leather shoes, leaving his old ones as a
memento of his visit.
The landlady notified the police and a
detective vaa ser.t to the house for par
ticulars. It was thought that he would
leave for Vallejo by last night's boat, as
he ppoke of jroing there, and the detec
tive was on hand to arrest him, but he
failed to show up. It is not known yet
â¢whether he has stolen anything else from
any of the other hoarders.
Duncan was a brilliant preacher, but
drink ruined him. Aftt-r hiÂ« enforced re
tirement from the Presbyterian church he
Â¦was sent to Honolulu in the hope that a
oharge of scene might wean him from
Jrink. He there secured the position of
instructor and chaplain in a reformatory
Institution for boys ar.d was doing well,
but tli*Â» islands did not suit him. and he
returned hero in October. I>>y3. He at once
began to Orink. but after a while he was
induced to take the gold cure. He went
to Portland. Or., and secured a church.
He w:is joined by his wife, who had left
him la 1533. :>nd for a few months he be
haved himself. One day he was seen in
a firunken condition on the street, and he
had to jrivc up his charge. When he left
the place where he had been boardine he
took a gold watch belonging to his host.
His wife shortly afterward secured a di
vorce from him.
He warn next heard of here in July, 1597.
John Axu-11, a restaurant man on Sixth
street, took pity on hlrn and gave him
employment as a waiter. He repaid this
kindness by stealing $&5 out of the till.
lip was arrested in San Jose and brought
back to this city. August 24 the case
against him was dismissed by Judge Low,
its Axtell refused to prosecute him. Two
riay.s later Duncan was sent to the Agnews
Insane Asylum on petition of Charles
Montgomery. He was discharged as
cased December 24. and the following day
was arrested in San Jose for stealing a
bicycle, which he pawned for 52 to buy
liquor. He gave the name of Charles Rus
nelL December 3d he was sent back to
the asyium. where he remained for four
month*. Since then the police have heard
nothing about him till yesterday, when he
was accused of stealing the overcoat and
s^hoes.
IN stentorian tones trained voices may
now be heard floating out of the City
Hall calling for a wholesale reforma
tion of this municipality. The "Mid
way" has gone and the Cafe Royal
will probably be the next point of attack.
Will the police then lay aside their moral
brooms, satisfied with having made a
hasty sweep or two and having cleared
the city of a small portion of its immor
ality? Now is the time to make a com
plete job of it.
Many are the dives in this cityâ known
to the police, but allowed to work their
evil undisturbedâ where gross indecency,
patent immorality and obscene exhibi
tions of vice are the stock in trade of
proprietors preying upon a low, degener
ate patronage of men and women. Such
places as the Thalia and Kapp & Street's
reek with vice and all its concomitants.
In justice to John Street it may be said
that he has not been connected with the
latter den of Infamy during the last four
years, although that place retains the old
copartnership name.
As in the Thalia there is no pretence of
decency. Rouge painted women of the
tenderloin flock in from an early hour of
the evening till midnight, seeking the
most conspicuous places in the so-called
"music hall," so that they may not
miss a transient chance of male compan
ionship.
An abortive attempt is made in Kapp &
Streefs "refined vaudeville show" to herd
the men unattended by women in one
part of the hall. The unknown stranger
of the male variety who enters this dive
and looks with longing eyes on the span
gled and painted women may be told, in a
moment that he must get a lady to lenter
the sacred precincts on the left side of
the house. ' This is only a show of decen-
cy, quickly forgotten and atoned for by
profuse apologies from the head waiter.
In fact, the house would suffer pecuni
arily if any stranger were left to go un
fleeced by the women of the street who
frequent these halls for the sole purpose
or soliciting acquaintanceship and thriv
ing off the opportunities that accrue.
Beer and whisky are the staple drinks
in front of the footlights and pretty much
the same back of them. As the hands of
the clock move toward the midnight hour
the ribaldry and unrestrained loose con
duct of the couples, heavy with drink, in
crease proportionately. The air is fetid,
stinking and stale, and when the noise on
the stage ceases the crowd reels out to
take a further dip in the sea of vice and
sin.
The performance is in a measure in
thorough keeping with the life in the hall.
Driveling, vulgar 'nonsense, the birth of
an abortive attempt at cheap wit, holds
the audienre between drinks. Interspersed
with these imbecile monologues that
strike the roof with offensive aggressive
ness, is a vocal display of sound as flat
and thin as some of the performers are
obese and mountainous. All alike receive
the applause of a dazed and liquor
charged audience who mingle wild shouts
of commendation with gulps of beer or
I whisky when half a chance Is given it.
This is the life of the cellar music hall
where the women gather to inveigle un
suspecting men. More often than not this
class of dive Is used as< a meeting
place, men and women gathering here by
appointment. The proprietor of the place
grows fat off the profits of the drinking.
The women are known to the waiters,
who keep them posted about possible
"good things" that have strayed into the
hall looking for adventure. These wait
ers are serviceable directories of lodging
house addresses, telephone numbers and
of all other information concerning the
customary patrons of the dive.
But Kapp & Street's, the Thalia and all
resorts of that ilk are havens of purity,
morality and virtue compared with the
cesspools of indecency and wanton vul
garity to be found on the Barbary Coast,
that district on the north of Kearny
street, just above the new. Hall of Justice.
The music hall gives way to the dance
hall, both underground and on the level.
These are the resorts where the "knock
out" drops are administered and drunken
sailors and soldiers, laborers without
family or associations other than infa
mous, spend their little money in a form
of recreation as debasing as it is ruinous.
In these places the women are engaged to
do their work on commission. They will
dance with you, drink with you, eat with
you, and every morsel or drop that en
ters their mouths means a tithe of reve
nue to them. The waiters who serve the
liquor distribute checks to the women
and these are cashed at the end of the
night's work when the woman goes to her
lodging.
The police department knows the loca-.
tion and character of every one of these
immoral hives. In fact, it has been the
duty of every officer on this beat to drop
in from time to time to see that no open
crime is committed. For a sailor or a sol
dier to bo robbed in this locality is of
common occurrence. With his self-con
trol dissipated by steady and unbroken
potations the patron of this kind of hovel
is an easy mark for the deft fingers of
women who have fattened off the help
lessness of men steeped in alcohol. Crime
follows in their wake.
The police have more than one target to
practice their guns upon. If they wish to
make a clean sweep of all the evil arid all
the unclean resorts they will have a great
labor to perform.
The Call will direct the attention of the
police to many festering moral plague
spots which if removed will better the
city unspeakably.

FECKER AND HIS
WIFE FALL OUT
OVER A CHILD
Â»
Well Known Here as Swin
dler He Poses in New
York as a Saint.
Accuses the Woman of Blackmail and
Kidnaping, When He Had Been
a Party to Her Shady
Deals.
Conrad Fecker, who was engaged In
several snady deals in this city during the
early part of IS&S, and who was shot by
Miss Evelyn Holt for trifling with her af
fections and' marrying a woman who
passed as "Mrs. Jennie Webber," has ap
peared in New York City, where he is
posing as a snow white angel of purity
and innocence, announcing that he has
discovered that his wifeâ the erstwhile
Mrs. Webberâ is an adventuress and a
kidnaper. ;"-">; "-"> Â¦*Â¦'/.Â¦'
Accoraing to tflographlc advices re
ceived here last night from New York a
lad who is known as Benjamin Fecker
will arrive there Tuesday from Germany
on the steamer Lahn. C. C. Fecker, whom
the boy calls father, asserts that the lad
was kidnaped from his parents when a
baby. â¢. Mrs. Fecker denies this -and an
nounces her determination to invoke the
assistance of the courts for the purpose
of regaining control of the child, who she
says is hers.
Fecker without a blush says he was
fascinated by this woman, married her in
San Francisco and lived with her happily
for several months.
"A great cloud overcast the sky of my
life when my wife confessed that the boy
who had been christened as Conrad Ben
jamin Fecker, did not belong to her. She
said that she had kidnaped him when he
was a baby. I begged of her to return
him to his parents, promising to even take
all the blame upon myself and suffer pun
ishment for her if she would do so. She
said, however, that for reasons she could
not tell me it would be impossible. 1 was
never able to learn the names of the
boy's parents. The nearest my wife ever
told me was when she said he was related
to a wealthy retired liquor dealer of San
Francisco. From a chance remark, which
she let drop from time to time, I believe
he was stolen in Illinois.
'"One day, about a year ago, my wife
came to me greatly excited, saying the
boy's parents were on her trail and that
unless she Immediately left San Francisco
Fhe would be discovered and. would have to
spend the rest of her life, in jail. , I tried
to reason with her, but could not. She
left Conrad in my care and come East as
far as- Wisconsin. After a little time, at
her request. I brought the boy on to. New
York, where she promised to join me.; I
afterward ascertained she left San Fran
cisco hurriedly because she had tried to
blackmail Colonel W. J. Sutherland.
After discovering : her $to be an adven
turess. I took Conrad to Germany and left
him there. Now he is being sent back to
me. 1 don't believe any court will takÂ«
him away from me."
Fecker s New York story reads well,
but does not jibe well with the facts sur
rounding his career in this city. While
here he posed as a hypnotist, conducted
a real estate agency and matrimonial bu
reau. He was arrested for beating' a
man named Joseph Neuman by the old
half-interest swindle and was held to an
swer before the Superior Court by Judge
Low. While awaiting trial he married
Mrs. Jennie Webber, Â¦ with whom . he
claims to have become acquainted
through the agency of . his marriage bu
reau.
, The wedding: led to his shooting by Miss
Holt, which occurred at the corner of
Jones and Ellis streets on the evening of
May 5, 189 S. She claimed he had not only
promised to marry her, but had swindled
her as well. The case against Fecker
was not pressed, and he and his wife de
parted from the city.
Neither were heard of again until
March of last year, when "Mrs. Jennie
Webber." accompanied by a little girl,
registered at the Palace, where she posed
as the widow of a prominent Chicago
phy&Jcian. She had letters of introduction
to Colonel W. J. Sutherland, president
of the Holmes Mining Company, who was
also a guest at the hotel. A few weeks
after her. arrival she filed suit against
the Colonel for $20,000 damages for breach
of promise, claiming he had won her af
fections, had proposed marriage and had
fallen down on his promise when it came
time to "toe the mark."
The suit dragged along until the follow
ing August, when her attorney dismissed
the action, at the same time informing
the court that he had been misled and
had learned that his client was engaged
with her husband in blackmailing enter
prises. Fecker also appeared and sued
Sutherland for damages for "alienating
his wife's affections." but the action went
the way of the breach of promise proceed
ings.
Previous to the disposal of the cases
both Fecker and his wife had hastily left
the city to avoid the police. The woman
was wanted on a Grand Jury indictment
for forgpry and Fecker was sought after
as a defaulting witness. Â¦
Nothing was heard here of the pair
since until their present difficulty In New
York. . :^: ,7/
GIVES AWAY SHOES.
Boston Shoe Company Adopts an Ex
pensive Scheme of Advertising.
The Boston Shoe Company announces
that It will open its big bargain store at
775 Market street Wednesday morning,
when the entire stock of the. Popular Shoe
Store, â¢ which has been purchased by
the Boston Shoe Company at 40 cents on
the dollar, will be offered to the public
at exactly the same prices paid by the
purchaser. This offer is made for the
purpose of attracting the attention of the
public to the new store, and , it is hardly
necessary to say that the purpose will be
attained. It is seldom that such an op
portunity to buy shoes >at half . price is
offered and people of small means , will
not be likely to overlook it. The Boston
Shoe Company is a big concern, having
factories both on the Atlantic and Pa
cific coasts, and it proposes to operate a
genuine bargain store in this city, where
men,, women and children may purchase
their footwear at minimum prices. â¢
MYSTERIOUS SHOTS ARE
FIRED IN CHINATOWN
Five mysterious shots were fired Â¦in
Chinatown about 10 o'clock - last evening
in the neighborhood of Stockton and Jack

been unable to find out by whom they
were fired , or the extent of the damage
done. The shots were distinctly heard,
and it is thought that they were flretUby
members of the warring factions. The
police are making a thorough investiga
tion to find if any injured persons are
being concealed from them.

of the accident until a bystander shouted to him that he had killed a boy.
The mother.of the lad rushed into the street, picked up the mangled body and
rushed' to'a drug store two' blocks away. As she ran,, all the while screaming
loudly, the warm blood of the infant-spattered in her face and saturated her
