JÂ£rj2S'i;o collapse of the California
Packing Company has re3u!l
iÂ£ ed In a series of eensatlona
&jÂ£f that la perhaps v.ithout purn!
%g&r lei in the history of the com
mercial world of San Fran-
Cisco. Men whose names hith
erto have been beyond the shadow of sus
picion are> being- hunted by detectives of
the Police Department. A warrant charg
ing one of the most prominent business
men of this city with felony embezzle
ment has been demanded and Issued.
ChargeÃ of fraud, conspiracy, theft and
business duplicity are being exchanged
on all sides. While one man is accused of
crime another is under the suspicion oi
one of the prominent banks of the city
and preparations are being made to ex
ploit the whole sensational scandal before
the Grand Jury.
Accusations are being made that two of
the leading business corporations of this
city have been used as dummies with
which to enrich a little coterie of com
mercial gamblers to the extent cf many
thousands of dollars. A respected and
aged merchant of the city accuses his
pon-in-law of having conspired to cheat
him out of a fortune, and bankers, mer
chants and detectives are watching with
eagerness to see what the outcome of the
disgraceful muddle will be. Meanwhile
the double life of one of the most promi
nent of local merchants is being exposed
and the racetrack gambling, poolroom
ventures and stock speculations of an
other are being revealed.
The crash came yesterday when Judge
Cabaniss issued a. warrant for the arrest
of Charles J. King, charging him with
felony embezzlement. King is a man
known from one end of the. city to the
other. He is high in the councils of fra
ternal organizations. He is prominent in
affairs of charity and of religion. He has
been honored by nominations for public
office, and until yesterday there was no
public shadow upon his reputation. Then
he was accused as an embezzler and
charged with being many thousands of
dollars short in his acounts as secretary
of the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works.
The police have been searching for him
for several days, but up to a late hour
last night he could not be found. And,
strange as it may seem, the arrest of a
man prominent as is King In the local
business world is only anMncident In the
scandal which the collapse of the Califor
nia Packing Company has provoked.

PLOT TO DESTROY
PROPERTY IN CANADA
Semi-Offlcially Stated That Attack on
Welland Canal Was Hade by
Organized Fanatics.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ont.. April 24.â
From a semi-official and reliable source
the following statement was obtained to
nisht In relation to the attempt to destroT
the Welland canal:
"There is no question that the three
men under arrest constituted one party
of a large gang which was sent out to in
flict damage in various parts of the Do
minion. It is yet a question whether they
came from Philadelphia. Chicago. New-
York or Buffalo, in each of which dtl<Â»*
there are many fanatics who hate Ens
land; or they may have been sÂ«>nt from
some part of Canada, because ther* are
fanatics here as well as across the bor
der. I think the attacks wÂ«>re to hav<Â»
been marie in various quarters and tha
failure of the first party discouraged Â«>r
postponed other attempts. The plan tr>
blow up the canal shows the conspirators
intended to strike hard. Hail thÂ«Â»y iujc

been discounted."

ciusively last Saturday in The Call. To
the surprise of the business world, th:s
corporation, which is the largest of* its
kind in San I rancisco, was unable to meet
a petty obligation of much l*-ss than $200.
The concern was supposed to be solvent
and prosperous, but the creditors soon dis
covered that its affairs had been grossly
mismanaged and that tho only remedy
was to fqree the corporation into Involun
tary insolvency. Inquiries were made on
all sides and then the collapse and expose
followed.
It was developed that the largest cred
itor of the California Packing Company
is the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works,
which is a sort of patron of the former
concern. The Paclflc Vinegar and Pickle
Works practically dominated the Cali
fornia Packing Company, supplied it with
material and encouraged it In trade.
Through an unusual if not singular busi
ness transaction Charles J. King, who Is
accused of embezzlement, was made sec
retary of both corporations. Elie J. Cote,
for whom tho police are searching, la
president of the California Packing Com
pany and Sidney -M. Smith, who has de
parted hurriedly for the East, is presi
dent of the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle
Works. It is around these men that the
storm of the scandal has burst.
When the creditors began their investi
gation of the accounts of the California
Packing Company they discovered a re
markable condition of affairs. The books
of the concern told very little that was
definite and when any single fact was
fixed it was flatly contradicted by several
others. It was like unraveling the In
tricacies of a Chinese puzzle to determine
just what amount of money the California
Packing Company owed to its largest
creditor and patron, the Paclflc Vinegar
and Pickle Works. Sidney -M. Smith, the
president of the Paclflc Vinegar and
Pickle Works, told his directors that the
amount did not exceed $30,000. Then he
told others that the sum was $64,003.
Charles J. King said to one class of cred
itors that the amount of indebtedness
was $43;000 and. another set that* it was
nothing. The experts finally agreed that
the California Packing Company owed the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works $24,000,
and men who have reason to be familiar
with the affairs of the packing company
Insist that the sum should not exceed
$12,000. Â¦ .
It was rery evident that some strange
jug-glery with the books had taken place,
and that all was not as honest aa it
LEADING CHARACTERS IN A LOCAL CONSPIRACY OF FRAUD.
should be. The glaring discrepancies in
accounts led .to further inquiries. It was
discovered that money which was sup
posed to have been paid by the packing
company to the pickle company never
reached the latter corporation. It was
found that In two collection days EHe J.
Cote found need to spend ti. . enormous
sum of $32,000 and that he had gambled
freely on horse races, prize fights and
stocks.
The investigators went further in their
search and found that the stock of the
California Packing Company, which was
represented to be worth $25,000, was is
reality worth not more than $6000 or $7000.
A suspicion that the grossest fraud had
been practiced began to crystallize into
a certainty. The investigators were
gradually approaching one of the most
remarkable phases of the scandal.
It was found that A. B. Patrick, the
father-in-law of Elle J. Cote, had indorsed
notes aggregating many thousands of
dollars. It is practically impossible at
the present time to tell just what amount
Patrick is pledged for in the financial
crash. It is claimed that Cote, whenever
he needed money or wanted it, went to
his father-in-law with 90-day notes for
various amounts and secured the neces
sary indorsement. On many occasions, it
it alleged, Patrick signed these Indorse
ments when he was ill in bed end did
not know what he was doing. For thous
and after thousand of dollars hÂ»? pledged
himself, his son-in-law Cote represent
ing that the money was needed to meet
obligations in business, most frequently,
according to representation, to satisfy
claims of the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle
"Works.
Â¦ Cote and his associates claim that the
aged and now dangerously ill merchant
stands pledged for more than SSI.OOO. Pat
rick and his sons, who speak for him. in
sist that the old man has not pledged
himself for half that amount, and that
more than that he has been robbed of
every dollar for which he stands sponsor.
At present and until a more thorough In
quiry has been made by the authorities it
is impossible to tell for what sum Patrick
has pledged himself, as he does not know
himself. The disposition of his ninety-day
notes, however, forms a curious and sig
nificant feature of the case.
Cote as president of the California Pack
ing Company would deliver the notes to

BÂ» 0K ASHINGTON. April 24.â Hon.
if/8 H Matthew S. Quay was to-day
tiLff \W refused a seat In the United
States Senate on the appoint
ment o* the Governor of Perm- j
sylvania by a vote of 3S to 32. The en- j
tire time of the Senate to-day was de- j
voted to debate upon the Question, many j
of the greatest lawyers and orators in i
the oody deMvr rlns speeches. As the j
day's oes=ion wore on and the hour f->r |
the final vote approached the galleries ;
filled until they were thronged with mul- ,
titudes. while other multitudes were un- [
able to gain admission. On the floor of
the Senate were every member of the I
body now in the city and scores of the
members of the House of Representa
tives. The great throng listened with
deep attention to the brilliant argument
of Spooner In favor of the seating of the
former Pennsylvania Senator, and the
i dramatic : and n>ry - eloquence "of "Cunlef
of Virginia, who appealed to his col
leagues to do what he, on his oath' a? a
i.enator. deemed right and to vote to do
Justice to him who was knocking at the
Senate doors.
As the big clock opposite the president
pro tern, indicated 4 o'clock there was a
hush in the chamber. Frye, in the chair,
announced that the hour for the final vot
had arrived, and that the question was
the pending motion of Chandler to strike
out of the resolution declaring Quay not
to be entitled to a seat tho word "not."
Senators throughout the chamber eas:erly
followed the rollcall. for all knew the
vote was close. Th? first sonsation was
caused by the failure of Pcttigrew
of South Dakota to answer to his
name, althousrh he wa? in h!s
seat. When Vest's name was called
he voted "no" In a clear voice, thus
clashing the last hope of the fr'ends of
Quay, who had expected confidently that
the ilistinKuished Missourian would vote
for his long-time personal friend. In per
fect silence it was announced that the
Senate had denied to Quay the seat which
he hns rought for some months past.
Penrose Opens the Day's Debate.
. When the argument on the Quay case
was resumed Penrose of Pennsylvania
continued his speech, begun late yester
(!av afternoon.
McCumber of North Dakota delivered a
carefully prepared constitutional argu
ment In opposition to the seating of Quay.
Only a brief while ago he was regarded as
r.n advocate of Quay's claim, but he an
nounced in a speech that after careful
consideration he had changed his opinion.
This condition, he said, was not based
upon emotion, but upon reason.
In an extended argument Lindsay of
Kentucky presented legal and constitu
tional reasons why. in his opinion. Quay
ought not to be seated. He held that the
appointment of Senators by the State ex
ecutive was provided for by the framers
of the constitution merely to provide for
the filling of vacancies that may be re
garded as unexpected. They never con
templated, he maintained, that the legis
lative power . to elect should be divided
with the executive, and he urged that in
the present case the Governor did not
have constitutional authority to appoint
Quay.
Spooner of Wisconsin said hi 3 long and
laborious speech two years ago In support
of Corbett's right to a seat had seemed
to have little effect, and had not even con
vinced Senators Quay or Penrose. He be
lieved the question pending ought to be
determined upon the constitutional view
of it taken by each Senator. Personality
had no decent place. ln the discussion. He
did not undervalue precedent, but prece
dent should shackle no one.
Hale asked Spooner if he thought It well
that this creat question should be continu
ally before the Senate. Hale contended
that it was better for Governors and for
Legislatures that there should be an end
of such contentions.
"I shall be glad." said Spooner. "if this
discussion shall lead to legislation or a
constitutional amendment that will put an
end to the possibility of such cases."
In conclusion Spooner contended for
liberal statesmanship and not a narrow
view of the case. Neither personal tie nor
popular criticism would influence his vote,
which should be cast for Quay.
Stewart explained that he had voted
against the seating of Corbett two years
ago because he did not think "Mr. Corbett
came here with clean hands. I have not
the slightest doubt that the Governor In
any case like the one pending has perfect
right to appoint the Senator."
Turner of Washington said his convic
tions compelled him to vote against Mr.
Quay, although he had voted in favor of
seating Cqrbett. He differentiated be
tween the two cases.
Question a Judicial One.
"This is a judicial question." said Dan
iel of Virginia, "and ought to be decided
upon Judicial principles. According to my
lecal convictions Mr. Quay Is entitled to
a seat in this body, and so believing I will
so vote."
Daniel concluded at 19 minutes of 4
o'clock.
During the afternoon the galleries had
filled gradually until at this time they
â¢were jammed. Every Senator In the cify
was in his seat and many members of the
House of Representatives, including al
most the solid Pennsylvania deleiratlon.
were in the area outside the rows of
desks.
The joint resolution providing for thfl
filling- of temporary offices in Porto Rico
was sent to conference. Senators Fora
ker. Perkins and Cockrell being named a<*
conferees.
At 4 o'clock thÂ» chair announce 1 thÂ«Â»
hour for voting- had arrive<l and the pend
ing question was Chandler's motion to
strike out of thÂ« committee resolution*
de.clarinK that Mr. Quay was not entitled
to a ?eaf trt the Senate t.ie worrt "not."
The motion was defeated by a vote of S3
j to Z3.
The question then recurred tr> th<Â» or
iginal resolution, and it was adoptedâ 3.l
to 22â the former vote being exactly re
versed on this question.
Thus Mr. Quay was denied a seat in thÂ»>
Senate on the appointment of Governo>
Stone.
The Senate then at 4:25 p. m. adjourned.

CLARA BARTON SCORES
THAT CHICAGO CORPS
WASHINGTON, April 24.â "1f the re
ports be tru*. these men have practiced
gross deception, broken a. pledge and vio
lated a. confidence which they nought. The
humane world wifi not hold them guilt
lÂ«?ss."
This was the declaration of Miss Clara
Barton respecting the reported action of
the ambulance corps from Chicago in
easting away its Red Cross emblems as
soon sjs it Arrived on the field of war In
South Africa and taking up arms in the
Boer cause.
Miss Burton called upon Secretary of
State Hay to-day and explained her con
nection with this ambulance corps. She
was accompanied by Dr. Hubbcll. who !s
familiar with all the circumstances of the
case. It appears from her statement that
Miss Earton, as president of the American
Red Cross, was waited upon some time
ago by .Mr. Judd of Holyoke. Mass., who
told of the intention of the Irish sucletk-s
cf Chicapo to s=>ind out an ambulance
coips to the Transvaal. It was pointed
out to her that the British side in the
war had received all of the outside help
ar.d fhe was asked to give outgoing expe
ditions credentials and the Red Cross
flag. After consideration Hiss Barton
gave Mr. Judd a letter of a general char
acter, askinp right of way and good treat
ment for the expedition as long cus the
members lived up to the rules of the
Geneva convention. Care was taken to
Include this Important limitation in the
letter. Previously Miss Barton had
learned that each individual composing
ihe party had made oath before a notary
that he was going out to South Africa to
work under the Red Cross and in the
ambulance service To confirm this lm
pwrton Miss Barton was consulted, as
was Dr. Hubbell. respecting the character
of the supplies to be taken to South Af
rica, the rjucntities of medicines and the
number of Ftretchers necessary for the
party.
There were about fifty-eight men in the
expedition when It left New York, a
proper number for an ambulance corps.
But when this party was sr,-elled at Lis
bor. by about 150 men who had preceded
them suspicion was aroused as to the
true character of the men. There was
s-till an Indisposition on the part of the
Red Cross people in this country to be
lieve the first reports of the breach or
faith on the part of this expedition, but
doubt on that point has been removed by
the receipt of Consul Hay's cablegram
confirming the news dispatches. It is not
felt that the Red Cross of America has
been to blame in the matter or that it can
be held responsible for the actions of a
party organized as was this one, entirely
outside of the society's own material; nor
could the request to aid what appeared to
be a laudable enterprise be declined,
though it is improbable that any more,
expeditions of the kind will receive coun
tenance.

REV. ROWLAND HILL
WANTED IN NEBRASKA
Preacher Who Afterward Became a
Milkman Is Accused of
Bigamy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Nebr.. April 24.â Rev. Rowland
P. Hill, under arrest 'at Tacoma, Wash.,
for bigamy, is wanted at Blair, Nebr.,
where a year ago he married Miss Dolly
Powell. Hill's first wife will reach here
this week, having sailed from England
April 14. Hill is a graduate of Cambridge
and a high churchman. A special from
Blair says:
Rowland P. Hill, or Hills, as the Eng
lish letters give his name, was married
here at the Episcopal church by Rector
Young on March 11, IS9D, to Dolly Powell,
daughter of Edgar Powell, now living at
Florence, Nebr. Hills was formerly rec
tor of the Church of England at Bolsover,
Chesterfield, England. He was married to
MiÂ«s Adsetts of that place about 1593 and
left her in January, 151*6. coming to Phila
delphia. He returned to England in Feb
ruary of the same year and again came to
the United States in August, coming to
New York with his ordination papers,
where he entered upon church work. His
wife's letters followed him. and the
Bishop revoked his license there. He then
came to Atlantic, lowa, and again his
license was taken away from him. There
he became acquainted with the Powell
family, with whom he came to Blair and
went into the milk business. Rev. Mr.
Young had been warned to look out for
one Dr. Hills, but little dreamed that the
man who brought milk to his back door
was the one. It was at the request of the
parents and upon affidavits of Hills that
he had never been married that Rev. Mr.
Young consented to perform the marriage
ceremony, having misgivings of the man
on account of his highly educated man
ners.
Upon learning that he was the man
of whom he had been warned about ten
months before he has taken earnest steps
to have him brought to justice.

MARRIAGE THAT
SHAKES BERLIN
COURT CIRCLES
Dowager Empress Frederick
Wedded to Count
Saeckentorf.
Legul Ceremony Recalls an Old
Scandal Dating Back to the
Reign of the First
William-
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April 24.â A sensational fact
concerning the court of Berlin has Just
come to light, a fact, however, which will
not surprise those familiar with certain
scandals current in court circles during
the reign of Emperor Frederick. The lat
ter's widow, Empress Frederick, has just
been married to Count Saeckentorf.
It was observed when the Empress was
last In Naples that she walked about Â¦with
Count Saeckentorf arm-in-arm and caused
not a little comment thereby, especially In
view of the* fact that during the reign of
William I the Empress was ordered to
leave Berlin by reason of her familiarity
with this court official. Even during the
time of Emperor Frederick a scandal was
quietly circulated concerning the relations
between the two. As both the Count and
the Empress are now well on in years, the
desire to put an end to court chatter, and
by virtue of a legal marriage to spend
their lives quietly together, unhampered
by the discomfort of a false position, may
be easily understood. The Empress desired
that the announcement of the marriage
sh6uld be made public, but this the Kaiser
objected to.
The source from which the information
comes makes the fact as reported here in
disputable.

UPRISING OF
CHINESE REBELS
IS EXPECTED
Â» Â¦
Quantities of Arms Have
Been Shipped Into the
Interior.
In Many Places Camps Have Been
Established and Revolution
ists Are Drilling
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, April 24.â According
to news received here by the Empress of
China great preparations are being made
by the rebels of China for a big revolu
tion. A Macao correspondent says there
Is not the slightest doubt that tho near
future will see a vast army of rebel 3
rising in the interior. During the four
months of the present year no less than
20,000 Mauser rifles and a great quantity
of' ammunition and other war materials,
were taken inland from that port and
colony. On March 19 a German steamer
arrived there with cases of what pur
ported to be merchandise, but which it
was afterward learned was COCO rifles and
a large stock of powder and ammunition.
The captain of the steamer said these
arms had all been sold to the people of
inland China. *
A correspondent of the North China
Daily News in Shantung says the move
ment of the "Boxer" rebels continues to
grow. In many places there are camps
of Chinese drilling with more or less pub
licity with the firm expectation that in the
not long distant future there is to be a
general rising.
The rebellion in Shantung is growing to
an alarming extent, the revolutionists
having even made an irruption into Chill,
and it Is even said by some correspondents
that they have reached the neighborhood
of Tientsin, so that should they attempt
to enter that settlement the foreign troops
will have to land to protect life and prop
erty.
The Peking Government, however, de
siring to avert the necessity it is pre
sumed of alien interference, has sent 7000
troops to attack the rebels. In Canton,
too. despite the attempts of Li Hung
Chang to put it down, the insurrection
grows, and from Wei-Hal-Wel comes
news that disturbances are threatened be
tween the British and the Chinese.
EMPEROR OF CHINA ILL.
Humor Current That He Is Being
Slowly Poisoned.
YOKOHAMA, April 13, via Victoria, B.
C, April 24.â As to the approaching de
mise of the Emperor there are strangely
conflicting reports. A few days ago there
came the news that the court was mak
ing extensive preparations for going into
mourning, the Empress Dowager, it being
presumed, buying her supplies. â¢* .
I The same day, however, came the an
nouncement of visits paid by the Dowager
to the Ewo palace, in company with the
Emperor. Private accounts, nevertheless,
all agree that his Majesty Is In a pre
carious condition, some averring that slow
poison is doing its work and that' the re
ported death w.ill shortly reach some such
culmination.
Mounted Infantry yesterday, under Gen
eral lan Hamilton, occupied the water
workÂ«< at Sannas Post. As the enemy are
holding the neighboring hills In some
strength, the Ninth Division, consisting
of General Smith Dorrien's and General
Macdonald's brigades, has been dispatched
to support Hamilton.
"General Maxwell's brigade, formerly
General Chormpide's, of the Seventh Divi
sion, yesterday moved eastward and
poized the hills covering: the wagon bridge
over the Modder River at Krans Kraal,

by the Boers during the Last three weeks.
Our only casualty was Private Brun. New

SAYS BRITISH GENERALS
ARE VERY INCOMPETENT
PARIS. April 24.â Captain Leon, the
French engineer, who had charge of the
Boer artillery and engineers and who was
phot in the head during the siege of Ktm
terley. arrived at Marseilles to-day. His
head is still bandaged and the sight of the
left eye- is lost. In the course of an in
terview he discussed the Boera as "splen
did artillerists." He said they never had
more than from 36.000 to 40.000 men under
arms, and of these they had lost only
6000. of whom only 600 had been killed.
"In my opinion," said Captain Leon,
"unless the Boers win an Important vic
tory near Blocmfontein they must b<
beaten In the end, and although Pretoria
could withstand a Jong siege, because it
still possesses cannon and emplacements
for those temporarily withdrawn, I be
lieve the plan of the Boers is to* take
refuge In the mountainous region to the
north, which la practlcaly Inaccessible,
rather than to defend Pretoria at the risk
of a heavy lo*s of life and the exposure
of the population to the fire of the British.
Evm when Great Britain declares the
Transvaal annexed the Boers will never
yif-ld, and an army of liiO.ooo will be need
ed to occupy the country."
Speaking win reference to the climate
of South Africa, Captain Leon said that
the season was now approaching when
horse sickness ceased, and that Jthe Brit
ish would therefore not suffer much long
er on this account.
The death of General Villebois Mareuil
was. In Captain Leon's opinion, a very
great lors to the Boers. Louis Botha, the
new commander In chief, he characterized
as a "capable and daring general, upon
whom the Boers could reckon consider
ably." When his opinion of the British
generals was asked he replied: "They are
absolutely worthless. Their lncompetency
surpasses all belief. The errors they have
committed are enormous and Incompre
hensible."
SAYS THE BOERS GAVE
NATIVES NO QUARTER
LONDON, April 25.â Lady Sarah Wil
son, In a dispatch to the Daily Mail from
Maf eking, dated Sunday, April 8, says:
"Our bread is made now entirely of
oats and Is full of husks. This causes
much Illness. There are many cases of
nervous prostration and malarial typhoid
among the garrison.
"The news of the check to the relieving
column is a terrible disappointment. Last
Friday thirty-three natives issued forth
to recover some cattle which had been
looted by the Boers. They were betrayed
by unfriendly natives to the Boers, who
surrounded them while they were eleep
ing and shot them all but one. giving no
quarter. One escaped to tell tne tale. The
natives are now mad for revence and It
will be very difficult to control them.

PACIFIC GROVE. April 24.â The Ep
worth League convention, which
opens In this city next week, is to
be a gathering of extraordinary im
portance in several ways. Repre
senting, as it does the flower of
young Methodism in California, it stands
for much in the State's progress, and tally
recognizing this fact those who are at the
head of its affairs have brought a large
amount of thought and energy to bear in
planning for what they hope will be one of
the most notable assemblies of its kind
ever held on the Pacific Coast.
About 500 persons will be In attendance,
over 300 of whom are accredited delegates,
and leaders in things secular as well as re
ligious in California will appear upon the
platform during the convention. Among
these are Rev. Dr. W. W. Case, presiding
elder of the San Francisco district of the
California Conference; Rev. Dr. J. N.
Beard of Grace Church. San Francisco;
Hon. William H. Waste of Oakland. Hon.
B. A. Eardley of Pacific Grove. Rev. Dr.
Thomas Filben. moral and prudential

quet to the delegates will be held on Fri
day evening, the 27th. in which the local
league Â¦is host. Saturday afternoon a
sightseeing tour to the points -of interest
hereabouts will be enjoyed between busi
ness sessions. Mrs. R. H. Willey, presi
dent of â¢ the Pacific Grove League, has
charge of these arrangements, as well as
all preparations for receiving and enter
taining the delegates upon their arrival.
The new assembly hall being as yet un
completed, the convention will be held in
the old building, and elaborate decora
tions, in which the red and white Ep
worth League colors will jn'ngle with cy
press and llveoak and handsome floral ef
fects, have been planned by the commit

Ottoman Minister Notifies the Ports
of Bad Impression Created
by Continued
Delays.
Special Dispatch to The Call
CONSTANTINOPLE, April 24. â The
Porte has received telegrams from the
Turkish Minister at Washington, Ali Fer
rouh Bey. pointing out the bad Impres
sion created In the United States by the
non-payment of the Indemnity due, and
announcing the determination of the
American Government to insl3t upon
prompt settlement of the claims.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â 1t can be
stated on authority that the negotiations
respecting the American missionary
claims are progressing in the most satis
factory manner In the view of the Gov
ernment. The department has received
from Mr. Griscom. the United States
Charge d'Affaires, a cablegram announc
ing that the Porte has undertaken to
meet all of the engagements made with
the United States Minister regarding tho
payment of the claims set up on account
of the destruction of American mission
property in Turkey. It is not stated when
the payments will be made, and it is sur
mised that owing to the many obligations
of greater magnitude pressing upon the
Porte, some time may yet elapse before
the money is actually in hand.
The Charge also confirmed the press
reports as to the publication by the Porte
of an irade authorizing the rebuilding of
the destroyed missions at Harpoot and
Harsam, and the construction of an an
nex to the Robert College, the great
American theological school in Constan
tinople. This action of the Turkish au
thorities is regarded of an importance far
exceeding the mere payment of JM.QOO on
account of property destroyed by a mob.
It amounts to a recognition of the rights
of our missionaries to build their schools
in Turkey and insures them against what
they regarded as a gradual but absolute
exclusion from the domains of the Sul
tan.
On the whole the officials here regard
Mr. Grlscom's cable as marking the safe
passage of what might have been regard
ed as a critical point in the negotiations,
and feel confident that, in addition to
this notable concession, the t'nited States
will secure all of Its just claims.

I'sually there is only one- keynote speechâ
that of the temporary chairmanâ but
there were two to-day, and the one that
caused more comment than any other con

vry much of a Hanna day, without dis
"cniing or discordant notes.
The Senator arrived early In the morn

oeivlr.g visitors. Several delegations called
on him in a body and he responded in
speecbes. At th<? district meeting In the
af.lorr.oon hiÂ« friends were selected on the
DCW State eouiiniiteÂ© and all other com
mittees. There- were sharp contests in
cone districts, but they were mostly be
tween so-oailcd preferences. When Sen
ator Jlanna entered the convention hall
there was a preat demonstration und he
vaa forced to b-t'x his acknowledgments
from the piatforin.
In all tilts speeches and other proceed
inrs to-day there was no reference at any
time to questions <>t currency, the tariit
or ary other former lst^ue.

Hanna Called Out.
After the demonstration at the close of
his addiess Chairman N'evln attempted to
proceed with the order of business, but
the convention was bound to call out Sen
aiur Hanna. Finally he arose and spoke
as follows:
I am sorry that I have not the strength nor
the voii-e to comply with your request, and.
therefore. I rise only to express ray feelings
Of gratification at this kind reception. And
now that we have established the fact that
"We do know our business" (great laughttr

I say the spirit of the hour is one of abso

ADMIRAL DEWEY TO
ISSUE NO STATEMENT
Decides to Stand Upon His Record
Before the Kansas City
Convention.
Special Dispatch to The Ca!l.>V* -.'
WASHINGTON. April , 24.â Admiral
Dewey has decided to go , before the
Kanr as City convention on his record.
Unless the advice of come "of his friends
should overrule his decision he will not
issue a. statement' giving his ' views' on
[ pending national questions. The admiral
;. feels that the Democratic party is ac
j quainted with his services, and they can
i Judge his future conduct by his work In
! the past. Therefore he sees no advantage
j to be gained by the publication of a state-
I mem. Some ct his advisers believe the
j admiral is making- a mistake in failing to
! acquaint the country with the platform
j on which he v.-ill stand, and they predict
I that should he keep his lips sealed his
chances will very rapidly diminish. The
admiral is as confident as ever, however,
that his candidacy .will be successful. En
couraging 1 letters continue to reach him
from persons of more or less prominence
throughout the country promising him
their support and declaring that the peo
ple are with him. Some letters are re
ceived criticizing the admiral for his en
trance Into the Presidential rare. It is
kpown that some of the admiral's corre
| spondrnts and several of his friends are
j urginpr him to accept the Vice Presidential
candidacy on the Bryan ticket. Those
who know the admiral's detestation of
Rryarism well understand that this is Im
possible. Furthermore, the admiral feÂ»ls
that ho has announced himself as a Presi^
i dorctial and not as a Vice Presidential cant
j dldate. and he proposes to have first place
! or nothing.
Speaking for 50.000 children of the North

posed when the last delegate and
Utfce l&st delegate's lact friend had
stepped down from the train last
night that the town of Oroville was
foil, but it was not near full, as the
streets to-day prove people from the sur
rounfiing towns axe beginning to come in.
This afternoon's train brought In a dele-
E*tLÂ°n of Argonauts from Marysvllle and
ct&ges brought In a pack of Coyotes from
Chlco. To-night they and the Goo-Goos
arÂ« holding high revels. The day was a
beautiful one, the girls of the town were
dressed in tnÂ«lr prettiest and the streets
are gay as & country fair. Politics in the
Grand Parlor has taken another small
hitch. Perkins of Athens Parlor has
withdrawn from the contest for grand
outside sentinel, thus leaving the Ala
meda delegation to unite in one fight, that
of Knowlsjid for grand trustee. He be
lieves this will assure his victory.
D. D. Lowney of El Dorado No. E2 has
Joined the fight for grand trustee and his
workers are out In force.
Dick Barton, leader of the Goo-Goos, is
out for grand outside sentinel, and the
other fights have lapsed Into silence and
hard work. It Is now reported that Kohn
may not go before the delegates as an
opponent to Martin.
Revels of Goo Goos.
To-night the Goo-Goos have possession
of the courtroom and they are trying
Dick Barton for the set of his collar or
the color of his hair, or something equally
Fc-rious. and crying for punishment. It is
hard saying what will happen to him be
fore they are through.
In the session hall the Coyotes are eon
*i-n-lr.g their dread degree on several of the
pracd officers, and when they are through
the Argonauts will confer their degree on
some more unfortunates. This will last
until daylight. Before the ceremonies
there will be a parade of Argonauts.
Coyotes and Curly Bears. The delegates
were busy to-day and got through quite
an amount of work and listened to much
discussion.
Fred H. Blackwell of Dormer No. 162,
whose election as a delegate was Irregu
lar, was nevertheless seated as a fully
credentlaled member of the Grand Parlor.
A resolution directing that the Govern
ment be petitioned to dedicate the old
custom-house at Monterey, the scene of
the first flag-raising in California, as a
permanent museum of California history
of pioneer days was referred to a commit
tee composed of J. J. Lermen. J. T. Har

vailing In the pioneer days of our State,
and In many other ways can serve as a

of those times."

a communication from Stella Finkel

of the celebration, for which and for
whom the Grand Parlor is In no way to

GOLD MINE FOUND
IN MARIN COUNTY
Rich Specimens of Quartz Picked Up
by Two Young Men in an Aban

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. April 24.â Ed Watson
and Bert de la Montanya, young men of
this place, claim to have discovered an
exceedingly rich quartz mine in the
range of hills north of San Rafael.
Although both refuse to give the exact
location of the mine, they state that they
suppose their discovery to be a disused
tunnel which was for some reason aban
doned by Its owner, several rusty tools
strewn about the mouth of the mine
seeming to point to the 'fact that It had
been worked for some time. The discov
erers of the mine state that large quan
tities of rubble had been piled over the
mouth of the .shaft, as though to -conceal
it from observation. The specimens of
quartz which Watson and De la Montanya
claim to have picked up at random In the
abandoned tunnel are exceedingly rich for
this region, and the mine if developed
may yield a small fortune for Its lucky
discoverers.

ACCUSED OF CRIME
Police Seeking to Solve a Local
Commercial Mystery of Fraud
and Duplicity.
Continued From First Pagfc
CISc Vinegar and Pickle Works. Smith
would then, acting practically as the
barker of Cote, discount the notes with
the indorsement of his company at the
Wells. Fargo & Co. Bank and at the Bank
of British Columbia. What became of the
money thus obtained Is yet to be deter
mined. Patrick had a large account at
the Crocker-Woolworth Bank, and that
also, with the exception of $350. went into
the maw of the packing company and its
patron, the pickle company. While It Is
not known definitely Just what sum Pat
rick is pledged for, a partial investigation
shows that the sum is at least $57,500. This
aggregate is made from several sources.
Tne Bank of British Columbia holds $18,
000 in these indorsed notes: there are $20,
000 in the safe of the Pacific Vinegar and
Pickle Works: Sidney M. Smith has. It is
Â»?aid, $17,000 in his possession; Abraham
son. Heinisch & Co. have $7500, and the
dinner on Sunday, declaring that he was
going into the country.
Two Insolvents.
A petition in Involuntary Insolvency was
filed yesterday in the United States Dis
trict Court by creditors of A. B. Patrick
of this city. The following amounts are
said to be due: R. C. Van Fleet, $6 65:
Mary K. Wood. $21; A. B. Patrick & Co.,
$1221 18. The petition stated the the cred
itors do not number more than twelve.
It is believed that the petition grows out
of the insolvency of the California Pack
ing Company. William T. Wilson of Sac
ramento filed a petition In Insolvency, In
which he stated his liabilities at $2770. He
has no assets.
San Francisco National Bank has $5000.
This represents a gigantic robbery, the
sons of Patrick claim, and they want Sid
ney M. Smith to explain why it was that
at the monthly meetings of his directors
he would declare that the California
Packing Company owed the Pacific Vine
gar and Pickle Works no more than $30,-
OuO. when he knew that there was $20,000 In
Patrick's indorsed notes In the safe and
$17,000 more in his possession. The only
explanation, they Insist, is an admission
of palpable fraud. So determined are they
to press the matter that it will be taken
before the Grand Jury, where the books
of both corporations will be experted and
examined. Whatever the outcome may
be, the fact remains that the elder Pat
rick has lost many thousands of dollars
and the corporation for which he gave his
money has been forced apparently with
out any good business reason to the wall.
It is claimed that the large sums of money
advanced by Patrick to Cote and nego
tiated in notes through Smith played ab
solutely no part in the financial affairs of
either the California Packing Company or
the Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works.
While Patrick has been striving through
his sons to discover what has become of
his money another creditor of the Califor
nia Packing Company has been hot on the
trail of the president, Elie J. Cote, and
Charles J. King, the secretary. His cred
itor is the San Francisco National Bank,
which loaned the defunct corporation $5000
on what the bank claims were the gross
est of false representations. As soon as
the collapse came the bank authorities
communicated with the police, and detec
tives have been at work on the case ever
since. They have been handicapped by
their innbility to locate either Cote or
King, who have taken no pains to make
themselves visible to visitors.
The bank people say that when Cote
asked for the loan of $5000 he submitted
what he represented to be a true state
ment of his affairs prepared by James
Bayes, who was not Ms regular book
keeper and who Is not now in the city.
This statement showed that the financial
condition of the California Packing Com
pany was first class and that it owed the
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works noth
ing. Charles J. King certified to this
statement, a.nd upon this representation
the bank loaned the money. The officials
now demand the punishment of these men
for their alleged misrepresentation. This
phase of the scandal will also be submit
ted to the Grand Jury.
While disaster was following disaster in
the affairs of the California Packing Com
pany and evidences of fraud were multi
plying the directors of the Pacific Vinegar
and Pickle Works began an^investlgation
of their own affairs. The result was the
startling accusation made yesterday
against the secretary, Charles J. King, and
the Issuance of the warrant charging him
with felony embezzlement. King, as al
ready indicated. Is a man of prominence,
lie has Interested himself In fraternal and
religious affairs, teaching In the Sunday
pchool .and passim? the collection plate at
Sshbath services. - Â¦
He has been secretary of both compa
nies for a long time, ' but his accusers
claim to have very damaging evidence
against him. They say that his alleged
embezzlement, concealed for a long time
by a falsification of the books of the Pa
cific Vinegar and Pickle Works, will a?-.
gregate between $10,000 and $12,000. The
particular charge made yesterday, how
ever Is based upon the firm's account
with' H. Lev! & Co.. the wholesale gro
cers. These grocers owe the Pacific
Vinegar and Pickle Works $559, while the
books of the Pickle Works show that the
indebtedness Is J2900, an evident falsifica
tion of the records. H. Levi & Co. have
produced for the Investigators a receipt
for $150 signed by Secretary King. There
is in the books no entry whatever of the
receipt of the money. Upon this showing
Fred Shumacher. bookkeeper for the Pa
cific Vinegar and Pickle Works, appeared
in the Police Court yesterday afternoon
charging King with felony embezzlement.
The whole malodorous administration of
the two corporations has thus reached a
climax In the incident of- the accusations
against their Joint secretary. With
charges of fraud, conspiracy and embez
zlement clinging to the affair, the further
Investigation will be referred to the Grand
Jury.
At a late hour last night the police
searched the house of Charles J. King at
1839 Green street, but the accused mer
chant .was not there. His baggage was
packed and ready in the hall, and his wife
and stepson said that ht had left after

chapeaus and the clock-like precision of
the movements made the parade one long
to be remembered. The evolutions were
both intricate and simple. The beautiful

C. A. PITCHER ENDS
HIS LIFE IN SEATTLE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. April 24.â C. A. Pitcher, a
mining man supposed to be from San
Francisco, took his life to-day, through
the medium of cyanide of potassium.
Pitcher had a sweetheart, who Is sup
posed to be Anne King of San Francisco.
Whether It was trouble In love affairs or
despondency over financial matters that
caused him to take his own life has not
been settled.
Most of the letters found by the Coroner
were written by "Your Loving Sweetheart
Anne." They contained little that threw
light on the case, with the exception that
one contained the following:
"I am sorry you were disappointed
about Dan Burns, but do not do anything
you would be sorry for."
It Is presumed that Pitcher came to
Seattle with the Intention of going to
Nome. He registered at the Perrln Hotel
last Friday. He drank considerable and
on one or two occasions complained about
being In financial difficulties. The fact
that he had only SO cents left when he
died is looked upon as indication of-de
spondency over money matters.

LAUGHS ARE WON
BY DIGBY BELL
Digby Bell is making Orpheum audi
ences laugh this week. He has entered
a new field although he Is no farmer, as
the way he wins the house proves. In
stead of operatics in outlandish costumes
he gives us monologue in a dinner coat
and the novelty Is a success.
He is different from what he was and
different from what I expected. I am
not going to compare the" new Digby Bell
with the old because it is quite clear that
he is not traveling on his reputation. If
he did not have his reputation to live up
to he would not have to be as good as
he Is to make a hit. He would not have
to be better than other/ monologists in
order to be acceptable. As it is this gray
haired novice in vaudeville impresses peo
ple with his cleverness of the immediate
moment and taps the laughter of his
hearers -with at least every other line ha
emits.
Bell had always the distinction of being
a comic opera comedian with a voice and
he still carries it with hint He has a
number of jokes that were not old enough
to know before he reached San Francisco
and a few new versions of antique wit,
a good story or two and a couple of songs
that have merit. Before he leaves us I
expect him to revive some of the things
he did prior to his escape from comic
opera.
Rae and Brosche are new this weekâ
truly new. Miss Brosche does something
in tne line of a garrolous female that I
am sure no other woman could do quite
as well.

Officers Charles Green and Joseph Peld

Both policemen tried to mitigate their
offense by relating the circumstances that
drew them to the drinking resorts.
Green said that he was called into the
saloon by its proprietor to inspect the
back rooms and he was doing so when
observed by Sergeant Duke.
Policeman Feld was defended by At
torney Arthur. Bahrendt. The accused
officer pleaded guilty and asked for
mercy. In fining him his month's salary
Commissioner Newhall severely lectured
him. He told the. officer that the next
time he came before the board he might
as well hand in his star as he would be
dismissed from the force.
The board devoted the balance of the
evening to examining candidates for

lieve it will have a tendency to teach the
warring tongs that the better way to set
tle their disputes is with padded fists, and
not with cleavers and revolvers. Whether
or not the meeting of the two Celestials
will have a beneficial effect on the high
binders remains yet to be seen.
In the event that Wing achieves a vic
tory over Ah Sam he will throw down the
gauntlet to any fist fighter In Chinatown.
As there are a number of fighting men in
that section of the city it is likely the
challenge will be taken up.
The Chinese sports will bet heavily on
the result of the fight between Wing and
Sam. The latter will enter the arena a
favorite, because of his past victories.
Sam has defeated "Malliky" Bannon, the
pride of Sixth street:. Duck Low, Hot
Stuff. Punch Low and ''Solar Plexus." He
weighs 150 pounds and fights with a Jef

Three Favorites Home in Front at
Oakland â Pat Morrissey Defeated
by Mistral H, an
Outsider.
Â» Â¦
Trainer Johnny Campbell of Castaway II
fame put a warm one over the plate at
Oakland yesterday in Twinkler, which
captured the mile and a furlong selling
run at odds of 25 to 1. In his previous
Ftart at Tanforan Park the Brutus horse
had appearently not recovered from the ef
fects of his f-ftort in the Thornton stake,
for Gaffney seemed unable to make him
raise a gallop. Shaw had the leg up yes
terday and, never in a worse position than
third after the start, downed the favorite,
Gauntlet, a heal on the wire. If a "kill-
Ing:" was made ovi-r his win most of the
coin must have been bet in the Eastern
poolrooms.
While only three choices took purses.
very few of the books laid up any money,
the outsiders all being nibbled at.
The opening six-furlong sprint was pro
lific of many torrid tips. Petal and Lou
Rey. backed from 20 to 6, Elsin and Boni
bel all having a following. Brown Prince,
a 15 to 1 shot, upset things by taking the
lead in the stretch and beating out Lou
Rey a length. The saddle on Petal slipped,
which acounted for her poor showing.
On paper it looked as if Corolla held her
field safe in the seven-furlong run, and a
heavy p. ay cut the odds from y to 5 to 13 to
19. Third Into the ptretch, the filly then
assumed the front position, breasting the
tape over a length ahead of Coming Event
and Jack McCabe. 1
Little Ranch followed this up by land
ing the two-year-old dash with Ada N,
the 12 to 5 choice. In a false breakaway
haJf of the youngsters ran to the head of
the stretch, which incident seemed to cut
little figure in the ultimate result. El
Karn showed the way into the stretch,
when the favorite assumed the lead, win
ning cleverly from Illusion. Phil Archi
bald received extensive backing, but is
evidently cracked up too high, third being
the best he could do.
Mr. Ferguson presented Genua with the
five-furlong spin for all ages. A 9 to 1C
favorite, she went out of the chute and
was never caught. Beau Monde finished
in the place in front of Uterp, while De
Blaise, a well barked one, was left at the
post.
Pat Mcrrissey now seems to be the
"hoodoo" honse of the Burns & Water
house stable. Receding in the betting
from 7 to 10 to even money, Henry Shields
managed to get away from the post poor
ly and was downed with ease by Mistral

BOXERS SELECT
PHILIP WAND AS
THEIR REFEREE
Experience No Difficulty in
Coming to Agree
ment.
Neill Is Favorite Over Murphy' at
Odds of Ten to Eight in the
Betting Already
Done.
?
Neill and Murphy, the boxers who will
meet in a twenty-round bout at Mechan
ics' Pavilion on Friday evening, selected
Phil Wand last night for the important
position of referee. There was no hag
gling over the matter, each principal af
firming that he would be satisfied with
any representative man. Xelll was pres
ent in person, while Murphy* interests
were looked after by "Jack" Sheehan.
Murphy had only one request to jnake;
this was that no member of a recently
organized fraternal order, of which Xeill
Is a member, be chosen. Beyond this all
he desired was a man familiar with the
rules under which he and his opponent are
to box.
Mr. Sheehan was asked to name the men
whom Murphy would be willing to accept.
In response he suggested Phil Wand and
"Jack" Kitchen. Without hesitation Xeill
said: "Wand suits me; I will accept him."
This settled what proves at times a
vexed question, and indicated that neither
contestant wanted any shade the better of
it in selecting the third man jvho will be
in the ring on Friday night. Wand Is well
informed on tiie rules governing boxing,
and has earned a reputation for fairness
in the years he has been connected with
sport, both amateur and professional.
The selection of the referee completes
the most important of the preliminary
steps for the light. The boxers have
given unusual care to their preparation,
as each has much at stake. Neill Is in
line for the world's championship as a
middle-weight, while his opponent also
apr.ires to the highest honors, and is
averse to returning to his Australian home
a defeated man.
The bettors have already made Neill a
pronounced favorite, the opening odds be
ing 10 to 8 at Harry Corbett's in the
straight betting. The mutuel betting has
not settled down yet. the dollar bets al
ready made giving no line on which to
figure which man will be the choice there.
So many requests have been made for
the records of the two boxers that they
are again reproduced herewith:
Murphy's record â LlphtweiKht contests:
Defeated George Johnson, eeven rounds;
defeated Dick Wright, six rounds: defeated
Harry Howard, seven rounds. Middleweight

Joynt. O'Leary, however, was not so
fortunate, for Randy, which he was rid
ing, stumbled into the pair of horses on
the ground and threw O'Leary among
them. He was kicked in <he head by one

ARGUMENT ON
PENCIL DEEDS
NOT YET OVER
McEnerney and Budd Plead
Hard for Admission of
Documents.
Claim That They Have a Right tc
Introduce Them as an Incident
of the Alleged Mar
riage.
Another day of mouthing was the order
of the proceedings in the Fair case yester
day, ajd it was all about the admission
of the pencil deeds into the evidence of
the present case. For the first time since
the present litigation began ex-Governor
Budd took an active part, supplementing
McEnerney's exhaustive argument. He
is not yet finished with "his work, but will
continue this morning. Then the Pences
will have a closing shot or two and a de
cision will be rendered which may kee>p
the present case before the courts for an
other three months.
"We are entitled to put in the evidence
every circumstance that will show that no
marriage between Mrs. Craven and Sena
tor Fair ever existed," began McUnerney.
'"lhe deeds are not only relevant to this
case but the cross-examination in regard
to them was proper. The entire argument
of the petitioner was that the dee-ds are
irrelevant, but the moment it ia proved
that the cross-examination was proper all
claims of Irrelevancy must go with it.
"The genuineness of the deeds might af
ford a reasonable belief, that the marriage,
contract is genuine, and if we prove that
the deeds were forged it is reasonable to
suppo.se that the marriage contract was
also forge-d.
"The marriage contract and deeds are
so related in point of time that we ought
to be allowed. to show that both are for
geries. The petitioner has testified that
she claimed to supj>ort the deeds by an
assumption of the marital status at the
time when she brought out the deeds."
This was in substance McEnerney's ar
gument. In support of his contentions
great stacks of case lav/ wefe cited and
the .text books again played a leading
part.
Governor Budd followed with a consid
eration of the single point, the material-
Hv of the pencil deeds to the main issue,
which :s the marriage.
"The main issue, he sa!d, "is, "Was
there a marriage or no marriage? Each
fact that is adduced here is for the pur
popc of proving a valid or an invalid mar
riage. It was expressly agreed by the
parties to live separate and apart from
each other. Consent does not make a
marriage. It must be followed by an as
sumption of marital duties. From the
facts there was no marriage. The docu
ment of the solemnization was tut one
step toward the proof of the ultimate fact
of marriage. **^l
"The document is simply â¢ evidence to
prove consent, and it is no stronger In
kind than acknowledgments by Senator
Fair, and the deeds are but one link in a
chain of evidence to prove that there was
no marriage. The ultimate fact is the
union and all the other probative facts.
Not only must there be consent but an
assumption of" the rights, duties and ob
ligations of the marriage. status. One of
these obligations Is support, and so far
as Senator Fair failed to support Mrs
Craven, so far he failed to fulfill the ob
ligations. The deeds, being an incident of
maintenance, are Instances of support,
and therefore we are entitled to have them
introduced into the' evidence."
The court then adjourned until to-day
ct 10:30 a. m.

ney John P. Rodgers of Petaluma, Kior
dan & Lande of San Francisco, and At
torney William F. Porter of Fresno. The
biggest kind of a legal battle ia expected.
A citation has already been issued by
Judge Burnett, before whom the matter
came up. directing the executors of the
will of the late Lydia C. Wickersham to
appear in court on May 7 and show cause
why the probate of the will should not be
revoked. The grounds upon which to
day's suit is based are fraud, influence
and undue menace exercised upon her
husband by the other heirs of the estate.

decided is interesting from the fact that

WATER SCARCE IN KLONDIKE.
Miners "Will Make Their Wash-Up
by Rockers Instead of Sluicing.
SEATTLE, April 24.â Arthur P. Curtis
and two partners have just arrived at
Victoria from Dawson, which point they
left April 8. They say water is running
in all the creeks and will, owing to last
winter's light snowfall, be exhausted be
fore the clean-up is fairly commenced.
In consequence of the water shortage
many claim owners are pumplne from
Bonanza, while the majority will make
their wash-un by rockers instead of sluic
ing This will give employment at" good
wages for all the unemployed in Dawson
until the lower river breaks and the ex
odus to Nome sets In.
Sulphur, Hunker and Dominion Creeks
are the new fortune holders this year,
while Bonanza and El Dorado are pro
ductive as ever, the dumps on 16 (Cook
& Co.) and 17 (Berry Bros.), being the
largest on record. From Skaguay comes
the news that Armour & Co. are estab
lishing immense storage warehouses there
and aim to secure control of the entire
northern meat trade.

WICKERSHAM
WILL CONTEST
IS REOPENED
Suit Filed to Have the Pro
bating of the Document
Set Aside.
Son of Frank Wickersham, Who Was
Disinherited, Seeks a Share of
the Estate of the Late
Petaluma Banker.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, April 24.â The death of
the late Prank P. Wickersham of Fresno
did not end the litigation in the famous
Wickersham will contest after all. To
day the papers were filed In a new suit,
whereby I. G. Wickersham Jr., the young
son of the late Frank P. Wickersham and
a grandson of the late Petaluma banker,
through his mother and guardian, Mrs.
Cora L. Wickersham, seeks to have
the probating of his grandmother's will
revoked. Three similar suits are also to be
brought by the same parties as soon as
the necessary papers can be prepared, and
the big Wickersham estate seems destined
to be subjected to even more litigation by
reason of Frank P. Wickersham's death
than would have been the case had he
lived and carried out his original inten-
The history of the litigation up to date
In the Wickersham will contest proceed
ings is interesting in the extreme. When
the late I. G. Wickersham, the well known
Petaluma banker, passed away he left a
will disposing of an estate valued at some
thing over a million dollars. All his heirs
were well provided for in his last testa
ment with the exception of his oldest son,
Frank P. Wickersham. then one of the
best known residents of Fresno. He was
cut off with $5. Frank at once began con
test proceedings, but a compromise be
tween him and the other heirs was finally
effected and the proceedings were
dropped. By the terms of the agreement
the contestant accepted $28,000 in cash as
his share of the estate and also waived
all claim upon the estate of his mother,
who was then living.
A short time afterward Mrs. Lydia C.
Wickersham, his motner, died, and Frank
began a suit contesting her will, denying
that he ever signed the agreement, and
claiming that if he ever did it was while
he was mentally incompetent owing to the
excessive use of drugs, tobacco and alco
holic stimulants. In his complaint some
highly sensational allegations were made,
but before the case came up for triai
Frank Wickersham himself died, and the
matter went by default, no attorneys ap
pearing at the time set for hearing.
The case begun to-day marks what ap
pears to be the reopening of the entire
matter. During the coming week Mrs.
Cora Wickersham. the widow of the late
Frank Wickersham. will, on behalf of her
son begin suit to have the contest pro
ceedings instituted by her late husband
Just before his death revived. She will
also institute a suit in her own name look
ing to the same end. Mrs. Wickersham
will in her own name also bring suit to
have the settlement of the. estate of the
late Mrs. I. G. Wickeraham set aside, as
her son did to-day.
Among the array of legal talent to
gather before the Sonoma County bar in
the interest of Mrs. Wickersham and her
la.tÂ» son when " the matter comes to trial
in this city Is against the prisoner, and
people wonder what line of defense will
be offered by the lawyers for Ross. Dis
trict Attorney Lewis of San Diego is as
sisting in the prosecution. It is said that
Ross has threatened to make a break if
he gets a show, and in consequence his
trips between the jail and courtroom are
much Impeded by heavy irons, which the
Sheriff here deems necessary to prevent
any attempt to do further mischief.
GAUGED SHORT FREEDOM.
Count Lautrec Liberated and Then
Rearrested.
CHICAGO. April 24.â Count Lavine dÂ©
Toulerse Lautrec. charged by the Mon
treal authorities with having disposed of
forged bonds under the name of V. Cas
tano, was released from custody here to
day by the county authorities, but was
soon after arrested by Federal officers and
taken, before Commissioner Humphrey on
new warrants issued on the old charge.
The warrant under which the Count was
first arrested was found to be faulty when
passed upon to-day by Judge Dunne.

SAX RAFAEL. April 24.â Sheriff Taylor

of the missing Andrew Perez had passed

SCHOOL OF
HYPNOTISM
IS CLOSED
Partners in the Enterprise
Disagree and Go Out
of Business.
Recently Incorporated in San Josa
With Heavy Capital as the Great
Western Institute of
Science.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 24.â The Great "West
ern Institute of Science, which was incor
porated here a few weeks ago with JoO.OOO
capital and a grand flourish, has gone out
of business. The object of the institute as
Incorporated was to give instruction in
hypnotism and all branches of the occult
sciences, and It prided Itself on being the
only institute where schooling in these
arts could be obtained in the West. At its
head was C. H. Haviland, M. L>.. presi
dent: F. T. Mclntyre and W. D. Mitchell.
Unlike most Institutions of the kind that
dissolve, no unpaid bills were left around
town.
The projectors of the enterprise made
their appearance here about three months
ago. They had money of all kinds to
burn and became very popular around
town. A large suite of offices were rent
ed In the Rea building, and these were
fitted up elegantly, with carpets and fur
niture. Hundreds of dollars' worth of
printing was secured and sent out broad
cast, and it Is said the Great Western In
stitute was rapidly increasing. Trouble
arose between the partners, and a few
days ago the doora of the Institute were
closed and action begun In court to dis
solve the corporation.
In circulars sent out "the cereopathic
home treatment" was offered patients at
the low price of $10 per month. This de
partment was in charge of Professor L.
Morcief Deyo. who is said to have passed
in private life as Mr. Mclntyre.
"Hypnotic balls" were among the stock
of trade of the institute. Just what this is
Is a* mystery, but from the amount of
printed contracts left In the rooms a large
run on this article must have been ex
pected. They read:
Gentlemen: Inclosed you Trill find $5 In pay
ment for the Great Western course. It Is un
derstood that I am to receive the celebrated
"Hypnotic Ball." together with the five com
plete courses in hypnotism, mesmerism, per
sonal magnetism, magnetic healing, suggestive
therapeutics, vitaopathy, cereopathy, public
entertainments, heallnjr as a profession, etc.
It is further agreed that if I am unsuccessful
my money will be refunded as per your guar
anty contract and bond.
I promise not to give thÂ» Improved methods
to any other student or persons until I graduate
and receive my diploma, and then not to In
struct any one thoroughly for lesa than $30. It
Is understood, however, that after I have fin
ished the complete cours* that I be permitted
to give a partial course for any amount which
will pay for my services.
orange blossoms and chiffon. The bride's
veil was of tulle, and she carried a bunch
of lilies of the valley.
Th<* bridesmaids wore preen taffeta,
covered with white organdie. Their cos
tumes were trimmed with lace and made
with a princess effect. They carried
bunches of pink roses and wore bunches
of them in their hair.
As the procession entered the room the
I.ohenprin wedding march was played by
H. J. Stewart on a pipe organ that had
been broujdit into the house in sections
and set up for the occasion. Mr. Hlcka
gracefully pave the bride away.
As the last words pronouncing the
couple husband and wife were spoken by
the officiating clergyman. Rev. Father
Ramm of St. Mary's Cathedral, Mendels
sohn's wedding march burst forth from
the organ.
Durinp the subsequent jollity of the
wedding reception and while the bride was
boinp toasted in a flow of champagne
Stark's orchestra filled the chambers of
festivity with delicious music.
The floral decorations were in tones of
pink, the principal flowers used being car
nations and pink roses. Asparagus ferns
and appl*Â» blossoms were also prominent.
The centerpiece over i the altar was a
costly creation of orchids. Over the man
tel in the hall was a mammoth curtain
made of pink roses and greens.
Mr. and Mrs. Dean will leave to-day
for a bridal trip, but where the honey
moon is to be spent Is a profound secret.
They will not. however, go to Europe,
as has heretofore been rumored.

TELEPHONE REGULATIONS.
SUPERVISOR MCCARTHY'S discovery that
an ordinance of the city requiring the payment
of a license fee ot $2 a quarter for the privilege
of operating a nickel-in-the-s!ot machine for gain ap
plies to telephone slot machines as well as to others
of the kind appears to afford a solution to that par
ticular problem of telephone regulations. That view
cf the case was taken by the Board of Supervisors,
and by a unanimous vote a motion directing the at
tention of the Tax Collector to the ordinance and
caning for an impartial enforcement of it Â« waÂ»
adopted.
The language of the ordinance fully sustains the
construction put upon it. After specifying certain
kinds of machines, such as weighing machines,
phonographic machines, music machines, electric
nachines. etc.. it goes on to add: "Or any other
rnnchine or appliance of any kind, character or de
scription in which on a deposit of a five-cent piece, or
ary other piece of money or article representing
money, within S2id machine, a person is weighed
thereon, or music played therein, or other services in
connection with said machines so designated are .ren
dered, shall pcy a license of $2 per quarter for each
mr.chine so used."
It will be seen the language is sufficiently compre
hensive to include every kind of nickel-in-the-slot
machine. It as clearly applies to telephone slot ma
chines as to any other. As the ordinance has been
on the books for about four years, the amount of
bade licenses due by the telephone companies under
its provisions are large, and if they be fully collected
the deficit in the treasury which has compelled the re
form administration to deprive the city of street
light; and street sprinkling will be materially dimin
11 ncu.
In addition to calling for the enforcement of the ex
isting ordinance, the board, upon the motion of Mc-
Carthy, added to it a section providing: "Every per
*or.. f;rm or corporation engaged in supplying water
or g-Â»s or electric lights or electrical power or per
forrr.'ng or rendering any telephonic or electrical
horvLc to or for the inhabitants of this city and
county shall pay on their aggregate sales or receipts
a license ns foHows: For sales or receipts of $500,000
per quarter, $^51 per quarter: $300,000. $151 per quar
ter: $200,000. Sici per quarter: $125,000, $65 per
carter; $75,000, $41 per quarter." 'â¢[%Â¦
The icgaiity of the tax will of course be questioned
zr.<l vigorous cftorts will be made to evade it. for the
telephone company has the habit of tax-shirking too
stror.^iy developed to submit to any tax without a
!onÂ£ fight and a hard one. Moreover, we shall prob
ably hear, once more the familiar threat to "put it
in the bill" and make the public pay it. The issue,
there "ore. serves to strengthen the demand for mu
nicipal supervision of telephone rates, as it furnishes
another evidence that only bj- such supervision can
the people be protected from the exactions and the
extortions of the company.
There remains oac other important feature of tele
phone regulation to be dealt with â that of requiring
the company to furnish to the patrons of the tele
phone slot machircs the desired switch before dc
molding the deposit of the nickel. The tactics to be
pursued by the company in fighting that regulation
have been intimated by statements made by President
Sabin to the Supervisors, to the effect that if the pro
posed ordinance be adopted the company cannot give
as good service or as prompt service as before. The
statement suggests a determination on the part of
the company io keep the public waiting for switches
sn Jong under the new rule that there will be a de
rnrnd for a return to the old way. The company, it
v.ill be seen, is cunning and full of tricks. The only
way to protect the public rights is by a thorough
and comprehensive municipal supervision. That is
the key to the solution of even' phase of the problem.

PARTY AUTHORITY.
THE Chronicle again enters the field, chiding
The Call, the Fresno Republican and other
party papers which refuse to admit that the
California Republican Convention â¢of 1898 had au
thority to bind the national Republican party to the
policy of free trade with Porto Rico and the Philip
pines. We regret that the pen of the Chronicle slips
badly when it attempts to quote The Call. It says
The Call "then follows with the conundrum whether
California Republicans, who now oppose giving their
commercial rights to our island fellow citizens, are
false to the party?" And to^this the Chronicle
answers "Yes."
Will the learned pundit who insists upon that teil
us how these islanders became "our fellow citizens"?
It is a misrepresentation to attribute affirmation of
their fellow citizenship to The Call. That status we
have all the time denied to them. It is not conferred
upon them by the treaty of Paris, nor has it been ex
tended tcf them by any act of Congress.
The Chronicle insists upon the right of a State
convention of this State to conclude the nation.il
party upon an issue of policy until the same is re-
versed by a national convention. The error in this
is obvious. When a new issue arises, upon which
party welfare demands party harmony, and there is
no opportunity for expression by a national conven
tion, there must be an intermediate authority to act
tentatively until a national convention can utter it
self. There is no other such intermediate authority,
except the representatives of the party in the House
and Senate. This intermediate authority considered
and acted. The Chronicle is displeased because the
California members did not bolt that action and defy
that authority. Had they obeyed the Chronicle and
bolted they would have reduced their party to a
minority in the House, and would have done more
than defeat the Porto Rico' bill. They would have
given victory to. the constitutional contention of the
Bryanites and the Chronicle, that the Porto Ricans
and the Filipinos are "our fellow citizens," possess
ing all the rights, immunities and privileges that the
constitution confers upon us!
It will be seen that in such bolt as the Chronicle
advises there was much more than the passage of a
tariff for Porto Rico. It meant the declaration of a
national policy of the gravest and most important
character.
We need not again go over the argument and its
proofs, that the constitution has'not been extended to
these islanders. We know of no more dangerous
ground that the Republican party can take than that.
It is the Democratic position, which we are sure
that the country will repudiate. It means that not
withstanding the safeguards of the treaty of Paris, and
that without discussion by the people or a formal
expression of their assent, we have taken into our
body politic, as our full-fledged fellow citizens, ten or
fifteen millions of people, aliens to us in race, language
and character, with whom homogeneity is impossible.
It means that the territory they inhabit is fully and
finally under the whole constitution, and must re
main so. no matter what necessities the future may
disclose, fince constitutional territory was made for
ever inalienable by the verdict of the Civil War. Is
the Chronicle prepared to accept the consequences of
its position? Is it ready to stand by the full Ameri
can citizenship of these islanders? Is it prepared to
support the proposition that they may freely come to
California, and. after the year's residence required by
our State constitution, go to the polls and vote?
Will it present proof and reasons for their fellow
citizenship? Did Dewey's guns, or the Spanish sur
render, or the treaty of Paris, or the military procla
mation of General Miles, give them that status?
Leaving this part of the contention for the more
mature rumination of the Chronicle, we go to the
verbiage of the resolution of our State convention of
i.SoS. It says: "In the event of the retention of this
foreign territory, it should be the policy of the
United States to extend to it the benefit of free com
mercial intercourse with all sections of the American
Union, and to that end the provisions of the consti
tution requiring that all duties, imposts and ex
cises shall be uniform throughout the United States
should be rigidly enforced."
It will be seen that, throughout, this is an advisory
expression. At that time the Republican convention
thought that "should be the policy."
The resolution did not say, "In the event of the
retention of this foreign territory it is the policy," but
that it "should be the policy." Who is to determine
whether it should be or not?
There is but one answer. No authority could de
termine it except the majority in Congress. * That
majority determined that for the present it should not
be the policy of the United States, and the California
members went with that majority of their part}*. The
Chronicle insists that they should have gone with
the Democratic minority, and this we deny.
The Republicans deny it with us. They also deny
that these islanders are our fellow citizens. They
deny that fellow citizenship has been conferred upon
them, either by treaty, by conquest or the automatic
vigor of the constitution. The Chronicle seems to
think that it fell upon them as a sort of political
shekinah and made them voters and their territory
inalienable except by a dissolution of the Union.

THE GOVERNORS ON LEASING.
IT transpires that at the meeting called at Salt Lake
for the Governors of Colorado, Nebraska, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana,
Idaho, Nevada". California, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona and New Mexico, only five Governors were
present. They expressed satisfaction with things as
they are on the ranges, and decided if there were any
change it should be by cession of all the public do
main to the States.
Since then there has been a further illustration of
things as they are on the range. Dr. Romine, a
sheepman of Chadron, Nebraska, drove his flocks on
to the range on the Wyoming line. He first pro
cured title to a homestead taken by an actual settler
in that region, and dug wells, put up windmills and
equipped a headquarters, and then followed with his
thousands of sheep, overrunning not only the free
range but the patented lands of others. One morning
last week this gentle shepherd awoke to find several
hundred of his best ewes too dead to skin, and sev
eral hundred more too sick to stand. The water had
disagreed with them. He cleaned the poison out of
his tanks and disinfected them. A few mornings
later he found his windmills all a wreck on the
ground. They had blown over and the auger-holes
m the posts showed the direction from which the
wind blew. He found also that all his wells had been
filled solid full of dirt and gravel.

LADY GROOMS
A LONDON FAD
Lady grooms have made their appear
ance In London. They are the happy ex
periment of a riding mistress who believes
that horsewomen will prefer a companion
of their own sex to the discreet groom
who must always follow in the rear.
Fashionable English women view this
Innovation with favor. They declare that
it was lonely to ride with a groom lag
ging at a respectful distance. The charm
of the new woman groom is that she rides
beside her employer and acts as a com
panion and chaperon. She goes along prin
cipally for company. Her usefulness is a
secondary consideration.
The managers of the New York riding
academies laugh at the idea that the
London fad will come here.

HOW TO LIVE LONG AND WELL.
DR. D. K. PEARSONS' of Chicago, described
as a "benefactor of colleges, who has given
away a millionaire's portion of his fortune,
eighty years of age, in sound health, and resolved to
live twenty years longer in equal good health." has
recently made public the S3'stcm by which he has thus
far managed to fulfill his desire of completing a hun
dred years of wholesome, hearty and happy life. Â»'
The doctor, we are told, lives in a house with seven
open fireplaces and sleeps in a bedroom with seven
windows, the lower portions of which are always
open. He rises at 6, breakfasts at 7, takes a half-hour
drive at 8, spends three hours and ten minutes at his
office, dines at 1, takes a nap for an hour and a half,
then talks, reads or drives until 6, at which time he
has a light supper, and goes to bed at 8. His pre
scription for long life is summed up thus: "Clock
work, clockwork all the year round; keep cool; don't
overload the stomach; breathe pure air, and lots of
it; eat a vegetable diet; don't eat late suppers; go to
bed early; don't fret; don't go where you'll get ex
cited, and don't forget to take a nap after dinner."
About the time the Chicago man was giving that
vegetarian advice in the city of the pork packers and
the beef trust, Dr. John Fiske, the robust and mas
sive philosopher of Cambridge, was explaining to
his friends in Boston how he manages to keep vig
orous and hearty in spite of years. He says: "Always
sit in a draft when I find one, wear the thinnest
clothes I can find, winter and summer, catch cold
ence in three and four years, but not severely, and
prefer to work in a cold room, 55 to 60 degrees.
Work the larger part of each twenty-four hours, and
by day or night indifferently. Scarcely ever change a
word once written, eat when hungry, rarely taste cof
fee or wine or smoke a cigar, but drink two or three
quarts of beer each day, and smoke a pipe all the time
when at work. Never experienced the feeling of dis
inclination for work, and, therefore, never had to
force work. If I feel dull when at work, a half hour
at the piano restores normal mental condition, which
is one more argument for the hygienic and recupera
tive effects of music."
. It will be perceived there are wide differences be
tween the methods of the Chicago doctor and offthe
Cambridge philosopher. The one lives on vegetables
and by clockwork, but he works only three hours and
ten minutes a day. The other eats irregularly, and
stimulates himself with beer, tobacco and music, but
he manages to work the greater part of the day.
"Fiske has won the greater fame in the world of
science and letters, but Pearsons has made millions
of money. The citizen who desires to live a century
may follow whichever example best suits his taste,
but none should attempt to mix the two. It would
be a bad policy, for example, to follow Fiske in the
use of beer and tobacco while adopting Pearsons' sys
tem of abstinence from work.
The Board of Public Works is still sorely dis
tressed by its effort to save Telegraph Hill. A pass
ing attention given to some of the neglected streets
of the city might relieve the mental strain.

CHANGE OF NAMEâ A. O. S. City
This correspondent writes: "When I was
7 years old my father obtained a divorce
from my mother, and I. being awarded to
his custody, lived with him until 11 years
cf age. Since have been living with my
mother, who in the meantime married
again. Can I assume the name of my
stepfather without my father's consent or
without an order of court? Should I. with
out consent from either, assume my step
father's name and marry under that
name, would the marriage be legal?" The
answer is that legally no one has a right
to change his" or her name except In th*
manner prescribed by law. and that Is by
applying to a court of competent jurisdic
tion and giving satisfactory reasons for
so doing. When obtaining a license to
marry the party applying for it must de
clare under oath that the names of the
parties for whom the license Â»s to be is
sued are their true names. To assume a
name without authority is wrong, and Xa
secure a license to marry under a name to
which one has no legal claim ia also a
wrong, and It \: a maxim of law that two
wrongs do not make a right.

AN AGREEABLE OBJECT LESSON.
| \EPORTS that the Merchants' Association has
U-/ decided to sprinkle at its own . expense the
principal business streets of the city for w
period of thirty days or longer, by, way of giving an
object lesson illustrating the benefits resulting from
keeping down the dust, are highly gratifying. Object
lessons are not always pleasant. Sometimes they are
like bitter medicines, and teach wisdom by disagree
able processes, but the one proposed is commendable
and desirable in every way.
. Of course we would have had an object lesson on
the subject under any circumstances. Should there
be no street sprinkling, nature. herself with dust ani
wind would- raise an object lesson that no eyes could
escape. It would be an abomination and a nuisance,
it would injure stocks of goods, it would render the
streets disagreeable and make the city offensive to
every visitor, but it would teach its lesson thoroughly.
There would be no mistaking the dust and the wind,
and loud and long would be the complaints against
the authorities that left the people exposed to such
annoyance.
The object lesson given by the Merchants' Associ
ation will be unobtrusive. There will be no dust to
affront the eyes of people nor to damage the goods of
merchants, hence a good many unobservant persons
will probably never note the lesson at all. They will
go on their way unconscious of the fact that the
streets are being sprinkled, or even if they note that
much they will be unaware' that it is by private en
terprise and not by municipal administration the dust
is laid.
We ought fo profit as much by agreeable as by dis
agreeable object lessons. The sprinkling of the
streets by private subscriptions should impress us as
strongly as would the dust were the streets un
sprinkled. It should not be overlooked that the en
terprise of the Merchants' Association implies a lack
of adequate administration on the part of the mu
nicipal authorities. There is something wrong in a
community where private citizens have at their own
expense to sprinkle business streets frequented by the
community at large. It is pleasing, of course, to have
in the city men who are willing to undertake such
work, but it would be more pleasing to have a city
government which would not leave such duties to be
performed by private generosity. That is the true
moral of the agreeable object lesson the Merchants'
Association is to provide for us, and it should not
be overlooked by the public.

to erect sky-scraping fences, insist that they are en

Â¦into Moliere's plays that in which Oreon
discovers the perfidy of Tartuffe repre
sents nigh comedy at its b<?st.
Mollere was not a moralist or a reform
er. He took life as he saw it. He did not
pretend to teach. The mean or gross mind
will rind it easy to reflect itself In "Tha
bchool for Women' or in some of the
farces of which "3ganavelle." -Monsieur
oe 1 ourceaugnac" and "Les Fourberies dÂ«
Scapln"' (The Rogueries of Scapin) are
examples. Only the narrow-minded or the
prurient can discover dislike of true re
iglon in "Tartuffe," or Immoralityâ that
Is. the intention to be immoralâ in any
other of the comedies. Shakespeare as a
poet U as immeasurably above Moliere as
he Is above Corneille and Racine. But as
a writer of delicate comedy, of manners
and character skillfully arranged. Molier.*
is beyond all writers, including even tha
author of "Much Ado About Nothing"
and Lope de Vega himself.
!n 1*62. the year after the performanco
of T^he School for Husbands," Mollera
married Mile. Bejart. On February 17.
1673. while acting in "Le Malade Imagi
nalre," he was taken ill. He hid his Illness
from the audience; death was near; a
hemorrhage could not be stopped, and
that night he died.
The most brilliant of the contemporaries
of Moliere were Pierre Corneille and Jean
Racine. They were not great in cornedy â
though Racine wrote a clever comic play,
"Les Plaideurs" (The Pleaders). They re
main, however, the greatest of French
writers of tragedy. Their names would
have been sufficient to make a literary
epoch. The greatest dramas of Corneilla
are "The Cid" (ltÂ£7>, suggested by and
partly borrowed from the Spanish of De
Castro: "Horatii" (Les Horaces), produced
in 1639; "Cinna," his masterpiece, accord
ing to the French, and "Polyeucte" (ls4o>.
The lesser works are "Rodogune." "The
Death of Pompey," "Nicomede." "Don
Sanche," "Sertorlus." "Otho" and "He
raclius." Corneille made comedy possible
in France and revived tragedy. It has
been truly said of this Imitator of Roman
writers of tragedy that "his heroes are all
demi-gods and his heroines, except Chi
mene and Pauline, all men."
Corneille and Racine were rivals. Hen
rietta of England asked them to write
"Berenice." Racine carried off the palm.
Corneille was Roman. Racine Greek.
Their gen!us was so different that each
must be Judged by Himself. Racina
touches the heart: he does not, like Cor
neille. keep us above the ordinary feel-
Ings of humanity. Hi 3 "Andromaque"
(lijSD made an epoch as "The Cid" had
done. In "Britannlcus" Racine is strong
in the Greek sfr.se, revealing great psy
chological strength without physical real
ism. He takes us to the court of Nero,
but he avoids the horrors which the Latin
historian Suetonius and the modern ro
mancer Slenklewicz have inflicted on us.
In "Eajazet" he parted for a time from
his Greeks to return to the Romans in
"Mlthridatus." In "Iphigenia in Aulls"
("Iphigenie en Aulide ') and "Phaedro"
("PhÂ«dre") he reached his most glorious
height.
The court circle was narrow In the reign
cf Louis XIV, and then even great poets
bloomed or drooped In the smile or frown
of the King. The King, led by a cabal
against Racine, frowned, and the poet
gave up the stage, retiring to the society
of his wife and children. But Mme. da
Malntenon. the King's wife, wanted a
play In which love should have no part
for the young ladies of her school at St.
Cyr. On request. Racine wrote his great
pieces "Esther" and "Athalie," both sug
gested by the Old Testament. "Athalie"
MOLJERE
was founded on "Ion," a tragedy of Euri
pides; but when Racine borrowed he re
turned the loan with more than compound
interest to humanity.
Regarding ttie effect of the performance
of "Esther" at St. Cyr. the charming
Mme. de Sevigne says. In a letter to her
daughter, written on February 21. 1659:
"I cannot tell you the extreme beauty
of this piece. It Is a performance not
easy to represent and Is inimitable. It is
the union of music, poetry, singing and
character so perfect and complete that
there is nothing we wish to alter. The
young ladies who represent kings and
great personages seemed to be born for it.
Everything is simple, innocent, sublime
and affecting. I." continues Mme. de Se
vigne. "was delighted and so was the
Marshal de Belleiond. who left his seat
to tell the King how glad he was to have
a place near a lady so worthy of seeing
'Esther.' The King approached our seat
and. having turned around, addressed
himself to me. 'I am told, madame, that
the piece has pleased you.' I answered
with perfect self-possession: 'Sire. I am
delighted; what I reel is beyond the power
of words to describe.' The King contin
ued: 'Radne haÂ« great talents." 'Sire, ha
has indeed, and so have these young per
sons. They enter Into the matter as If It
were the sole employment.' 'Ah. that Is
very true," he rejoined. And then he re
tired, leaving me the object of universal
The great Louis had spoken, for in that
golden age kings were more than men of
genius; but now we remember the "sun
king" principally because the men of gen
ius he reigned over help us to forget his
arrogance and vlclousness.

historian and brilliant maker of maxims,
and Mme. de Sevigne (1627-36), whose let
ers are models of brightness, sympathy
and of the power of drawing character.
There are many other names that add to
the glory of the epoch called the age of
Louis XIV (163i>-1715>, Just a3 we speak of
the "age of Pericles," "the age of Augus
tus," "the age of Elizabeth." But the
splendor of the flashing constellations dim
by contrast stars that would be great
alone.
Moliere (Jean Baptiste Poquelin) must
be classed among the constellations. He
assumed the name of Moliere after he had
become an author. Of his youth â and. In
deed, of his later lifeâ all sorts of stories
and calumnies were current, for his pen
made him many -enemies. He was born
at Paris, January 15. 1622. His father was
an upholsterer at one time. Later he as
sumrd the personal service of the King.
At the age of 14 Jean entered the Jesuit
college ot Clermont. In Parisâ he owing,
like Voltaire, who records this, his train
ing in rhetoric and philosophy to the dis
ciples of St. Ignatius Loyola. Some time
about the year 1641 he took to law. What
ever pl?e he cid between this date and 1659,
It is 'certain that he was a strolling actor
and a hard student. The Italian and Span
ish comediesâ to which Mollere owed
muchâ were not included in the courses of
the Jesuits, though the Latin comedies of
Terence and Plautus were not unknown
names. Moliere studied the art of acting
from the strolling players, who were then
looked upon as outcasts, and the science
of constructing dramas from the Italians
and Spanish. It was a similar combina
tion of genius and knowledge, with theat
rical experience, which made the plays of
Shakespeare more than beautiful dramatic
poemsâ ln fact, acting dramas.
Moliere was permitted by the favor of
Louis XIV to establish himself and his
company of players in Paris. Before the
year 1620 there were no "stock companies"
in that city. Pierre Corneille had, about
1630, written some farces which gave a
theatrical troupe an opportunity. Cardinal
Richelieu recognized the value of the
drama as a civilizing process and brought
the play of mannersâ which is called in
France a comedyâ into fashion. The pic
ture of the disappointed tragedian In "Cy
rano de Bergerac" will give a clew to the
condition of the drama In the time of
Richelieu. Having employed his hand
for some time in adapting from the Span
ish and Italian farces, Mollere. in 1659.
produced "Les Precieuses Ridicules."
The "precleuse" was what In England was
later called a "bluestocking.'
As time went on the lovers of ultra-re
finement In letters and ultra-senslbllity
In life became more and more absurd.
But when Moliere's "Les Precleuses Rid
icules" (The Absurd Bluestockings)) ap
peared, "predeuse" became as ridiculous
an epithet as "esthetic" Is now, and both
meant about the same thing. All Paris
laughed. A new master of comedy had
arrived, but there were still touches of
the farce, of distasteful exaggeration
about Moliere. Comedy pure and simple
without the farce element was demanded.
The methods of Moliere continued to Im
prove until they reached their height in
r 'The Misanthrope," "The Doctor in Spite
of Himself" and "Le Tartuffe." These
are true comedies of manners and the
best of all his delightful plays, though
there are critics who will raise their
voices for "The Pretended Gentleman" â
how else shall I translate "Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme"?â and still others for "The
Hypochondriac" and "Le Maladle Imaff
nalre." In 1665 Louis XIV. who had al
lowed his company to call Itself "the
King's," bestowed a pension upon Moliere.
While Cornellle and Racine were rivals
and had rivalsâ Voltaire (ICM-1775) later
wrote tragediesâ Moliere "had no rival but
himself. He stands alone: he was really
the Investor of comedy pure and simple.
Like Shakespeare, he borrowed his plots,
and even some of his episodes, from the
Italians and Spanish: the dramatic move
ment, the presentment of character, the
laughter, the tears, are entirely his. He
saw deep Into life and he drew pictures of
what he saw. and those amusing: trifles
which seem exaggerated when presented
by him are even drawn from life. "The
chief character In "Le Bourgeois Gentil
homme" Is astonished to find that he has
been speaking prose all his life. A refer
ence In the letter of Mme. de Sevigne,
dated June 12. 16S0. shows that the orig
inal of this character was not a pretended
gentleman, but a noble, the Count de Sols
sons. The letters and memoirs of the time
are evidences of the appreciation In which
Moliere was held and of his faculty of
using the details of daily life in his com
edies. "Tartuffe." a satire upon religious
hypocrisy, raised a storm only equaled by
that which broke out after ,the produc
tion of "L'Ecole dcs Fcmraes (The
School for Women). It Is difficult to
understand why "TartuCfe" should be
considered a blow at religion, and
only persons whose consciences were
more concerned with the externals of
religion than the spirit could have thought
It so. It was natural enough that the
friends of the Abbe de Roquette. who It
was supposed was the object of Moliere's
satire, should have resented the Insinua
tion. But it was probably the enemies of
Roquette, afterward Bishop of Autun.
who pointed out where Moliere's arrow
ought to have struck, whether It was
aimed that way or not. "Tartuffe" Is a
comedy of character as well as manners.
It ranks in this respect with "L'Avare"
(The Mister) and "Le Misanthrope."
"L'Avare" Is a reminiscence of Plautus,
but an Improvement on the" Latin poet.
It has been asserted that Moliere In "The
Miser" shows too much tolerance for av
arice â he merely makes us laugh at it It
is quite enough to be grateful that he has
made us laugh with a harmless laughter
which will go on for a long time to come.
Increasing the merriment of nations. The
situations and even some of the lines in
"L'Avare" have been copied so often In
modern farces and comedies that now,
when we read the scene between Harpa
gon and his cook, it seems "full of quota
tions." "Les Femmes Savantes" (The
Learned Ladles) will always be a favorite
but probably of all the episodes introduced

SCHOOL BOARD'S
SUBTERFUGE HAS
BEEN UNMASKED
Easy Way of Dismissing
Teachers Declared* to Be
Illegal.
Although Classes May Be Abolished
the Heads Must Be Given Em
ployment and Their
Salaries.
R. H. Mitchell, recently teacher of
physics in the Polytechnic High School,
has won his suit against the Board of
Education. A writ of mandate has been
ordered issued by Judge Hunt. On the
points Involved the court has established
a new precedent which will hereafter gov
ern the board in its efforts to reduce the
force of teachers by declaring certain de
partments and classes abolished.
Mitchell was appointed to the second
ary substitute list and assigned to the
Polytechnic High School in the capacity
stated on August 25, 1597. On January 12,
IS9S, the Board of Education adopted a
resolution that Mitchell be elected to the
head of the science department of the
Polytechnic High School. Subsequently
Mitchell was transferred to the head of
the science department of the Lowell
High School. This position he filled until
March 31, 18S3, when he was relegated to
the unassigned list without pay. On May
10 1539, in accordance with a resolution
adopted by the board, the position of the
head of the department of science of the
Lowell High School was abolished.
The .Board of Education sought to de
fend its action in removing Mitchell by
citing a resolution adopted May 10, 1899,
to the effect that the rule of seniority of
appointment should not apply to the re
moval of teachers of high school?.
"From facts adduced at the trial,"
Judge Hunt's opinion reads, "it appears
that plaintiff's removal was not prompted
by any considerations of economy, as the
result of reclassiflcation or rearrangement
of classes in the high school, so the ac
tion could not be Justified under the rule
previously mentioned. The excuse was a
mere pretense, because after plaintiff was
discharged another teacher was selected
in his place. In my opinion plaintiff was
a regular teacher in the department and
as such regular teacher the board had no
power to dismiss him except for insubor
dination or other causes, as prescribed in
the code. My conclusion, therefore, is that
while the Board of Education had author
ity to abolish the position of head of the
department of science of the Lowell High
School It had no right to remove the
plaintiff from the department and deprive
mm of both employment and salary. The
plaintiff is therefore entitled to a writ re
storing him to the position of a regular
teacher in the high schools of this city
and county."

All Kinds of Craft Ready to
Join in the Rush to
Cape Nome.
Yachts, Coasters, Ocean Steamers and
ex-Transports Will All Carry
Gold-Hunters to Frozen

The time Is drawing near for the exodus
of the Cape Nome fleet, and every wharf
from Melggs to the Mail dock has one or
more craft alongside fitting out. Every
class of vessel ever seen In the bay of San

Charles Nelson will be the contingent
from the ocea.n-going fleet, several ships
are on the berth and almost every bark,
barkentine and bri? that can be pressed
into service will carry freight and pas
sengers. Schooners are going north by
dozens, and half a dozen yachts have been
fitted out and some ot them are now on
their way to the Alaskan Ei Dorado.
'lhe rush to Nome tnis year is soinjr to
rival the great stampede to tne Klondike
in 1*97. At the present time it looks as
though there win not be enough vessels
in the trade to carry all the gold hunters
who wish to reach tne new treasure fields.
Close calculators say that aU.uw men will
attempt to reach Nome this season, while
there is only transportation lacillties for
2u,uw. No wonder, then, that every vessel
on the berth has every inch of room taken
aiready, although it is yet two weeks ana

15 there will be an exodus of gold hunters
from this port such as has never been
seen before in the history of California.

SITUATION IN
THE PHILIPPINES
"WELL IN HAND"
War Department Announces
Organized Resistance
at an End.
Secretary Root Regards as Favorable
the Outlook for the Ultimate
Pacification of the
Islands.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The military
situation in the Philippines, as shown by
the latest mall advices received at the
War Department, is summarized in the
following statement, which was made
public to-day at the department:
On the let of January, 1500, the insurrec
tion in the part of Luzon embracing the pro
vince of Manila and the provinces to the north
of It had collapsed to the extent that or
ganized resistance to American control had
virtually ceased. A different state of affairs
existed in Caylte. Batangas. Lancuna and
Tayabasa. the provinces lying immediately
south of Manila. In this territory, the richest
and most populous of the island, the birth
place of Agulnaldo and the rebellion, the in
surgent troops were still Intact and in fact
had been strengthened by accessions from the
north and as regards equipment, discipline and
cohesion were equal If not superior to any that
had been raised in support of the insurgent
cause. General Otis committed the taelc of
the destruction and dispersion of the forces
within this district to two expeditionary
brigade*, commanded respectively by Briga
dier Generals Wheaton and Schwan.
In and about the two towns of Bacoor and
Imus. tn northern Cavlte, there were and
long had been insurgent bodies of considerable
size, tome of which had actually beslejed our
garrisons in those towns. These insurgent
bodies General Wheaton's command attacked
and completely routed on January 7 last. Fur
ther disintegration of the remnants of this
forceâ giving it. so to speak, thi "coup de
prace"â of suppressing the insurgent troops
in the remainder of the four provinces and
of restoring, if practicable, peace and order
therein, fell to the lot of General Schwan's
brigade.
In the course of its campaign hiÃ troops cov
ered C',o miles, fought thirty-three combats and
established permanent garrison* i:i twenty-one
towns with this district. It set out on Janu
ary 4, and its work was practically finished
on February 8. Not that all hostilities had
ceased; on the contrary our troops have had
and fctlll have frequent conflicts with the robber
bands that were lormed from the disintegrated
Insurgent armies, and emerged periodically
frnm their hldinc places tn mountain and
thicket to pounce upon inadequately guarded
wagon trains and small parties. Hut concert
of action or co-operation, save on a very lim
ited scale, was ended on the latter date; the
control exercised by *ie insurgent leaders, ex
cept over their small immedlal-3 following, was
minimized and their power for mischief mate
rially reduced, if not wholly broken. In the
principal towns or centers of trade and munici
pal government, military forces, generally
battalion*, have been placed. These forces
operate within their spheres under their ma
jors, for the most part energetic young officers
holding lesser rank In the regulars, and when
ever necessary to co-operate under their colo
nels for the battalions of a regiment, are
grouped in neighboring places.
On the whole, the outlook for the pacifica
tion of this district and other parts of Luzon
Is favorable. In their conflicts with our troops
the Ladrones are universally worsted. Their
defeats will become more serious as our troops
gain the confidence of the intelligent and
property-owning class, and when the latter be
come unwilling to submit to the robbers' ex
actions and become willing to guide our troops
to their retreats, their doom will be sealed.
To accomplish this object may take time and
It Is possible some of the robber bands may
be able to maintain themselves during the
coming wet season, but their eventual destruc
tion is regarded as certain.
GOLDEN AGES OF* LITERATURE.
XVIIâ MOLISBE AND THE AGE
OF LOUIS XIV.
BY MAURICE FRANCIS EGAX, LL. D.
The name of Louis XIV. with whom the
Caesarism of the Bourbons culminated,
recalls not only the splendor and
vicicusness cf his court, the garish mag
nificence of his palace of Versailles, the
bravery of his generals, but several names
of great men of letters whose fame would
live even if the "sun king" were forgotten.
These are Moliere. "the prince of com
edy, 1 , 1 as Sir Walter Scott calls him; Ra
cine (1639-99). Cornellle (1606-S4). writers of
tragedies not second to those of Euripides
and Sophocles; Bossuet (1627-1704); Fene
lon (1651-1715), the most eloquent and cul
tivated men of their time, whose glory has
not been dimmed by succeeding time; La
Fontaine (1621-53), "the flower of the
French spirit, with the perfume of an
tiquity," whose fables have become part
of the household language in every civil
ized country. There are. too, Boileau
(1636-1711). the master of exquisite satire
and the mentor of stylists, and Descartes
( 1396-16"*)), whose Influence as a philosoph
ical investigator has been so powerful:
Pascal (1623-62). a scientist with an ardent
imagination; La Rochefoucauld (1513-S0),

THE HEALTH HABIT.
Just es Easy to Form as Any Other.
We do not deliberately form our pet
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and grow as we crow. and by the
time we learn they are hurting us, we
find them too strong to be easily broken.
Then, why not form a good habit, a
habit which will counteract the many bad
ones. In other words contract the unfash-
ionable habit of being always well.
The best health habit to get into is to
rnve and keep a vigorous stomach: if you
have a healthy digestion you can drink
your beloved coffee, smoke your favorite
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm;
the mischief begins when these things are
forced upon the faithful stomach, without
any assistance.
Form the habit of taking after mea'.s
som* harmless but efficient digestive
which will relieve the stomach of so much
extra work.
Nature furnishes us with such digestives
and when they are combined In such a
pleasant preparation as Stuart's Dyspep-
fia Tablets, they give the overworked
stomach just the necessary as. c lstance to
Ffcure perfect digestion without any of
the harmful effects of cathartics and sim-
ilar drugs'.
The habit of taking Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals is as necessary to the
weak stomnch as food Itself, and Indeed
to pet the Deneflt from food eaten, noth-
ing better and certainly nothing safer can
be used. â¢
Many families consider Stuart's Tablets
ai> ettential ir. the house as knives and
ioiks.
They consist entirely of r.aturai digest-
ive principles without the effect or char-
acteristics of drugs: they have no cathar-
tic action, but simply go to work on the
fond taten and ci'gest it.
Take Into account your bad habits and
the expense they entail and then invest
fifty cents In a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets .'ird fee if your digestion" for the
next month is not vastly Improved.
Ask the clerk in any drug store the
name of the most successful and popular
â¢ tomach remedy and he will say "Stu-
art's."

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Arm 24.â There were indica
tions of soir.e large operations on the Stock
Exchange to-day and the market seemed to be
under manipulation for the purpose of facil
itating them. Yesterday's late show of
strength found a resrx-nse In the London mar
ket this morning and prices of Americans were
well advanced before the opening here. Lon
don bought quite freely ir. this market after
trading commenced. But it quickly became
manifest that yesterday's rally in prices was
largely due to the demand from the short
Interest. After the opening Fpurt buying
Quickly fell off and prices fell back while the
market became very dull. The pool opera
tions to Missouri Pacific, which were a prom
inent tactor in yia^erday's rally, came to a
Â«.jp .:.,-Â».:: and ttuÂ»t mock fell back. The
room-uÂ»d<*rs turned to the bear eide and
Â¦worked for a reaction. The vigorous attack
on Baltimore and Ohio and Reading first pre
:Â»irred <auw-d declines of 3% and 3% respect
ively, and broke the whole list quite eharply.
But at the decline very large buying de
veloped again for Loth accounts, all offerings
fee-rig freely absorbed, apparently with no de
*=ire to advance prices. A very characteristic
luuvemer.t in Sugar indicated the periodical
punishment to the shorts In the stock. After
a preliminary drive which carried the price
to 104^Â» tlie stock gradually ehot up in the
last hour to 111/ iÂ». The scramble of the shorts
to cover helped on the rise and enormous
blocks changed hands. People's Gas at the
same time rallied 2 points and the whole list
vas more or lee* affected. Feverishness in
Fupar and one or two relapses elsewhere gave
a bilghtly irregular tone, but the closing was
generally firm and at small net changes in the
majority of stocks. Dealings in the steel in
dustrials continued large, but the price move
ments v.eie unsensaiiunal and the changes
email. The short Interest continued to cover
In ts.e group or. a large scale. Some of the
recent deiiiand for exchange Is reported to
have been for investment, and bills bought
for this account would come on the market
at or near the gold export point. But the
general opinion is that gold will ehortly go
out, ji-s discount rates continue to harden in
London arid money rates to decline in New
York. Already money rates are lower here
and higher in London than in June last when
$2<i,oOU,uuU went out iti payment of Spanish war
claims. The demand sterling at that Ume did
not rise above $4 6^>4, compared with $4 (>SVÂ»
this morning. The Bank of England wajs then
bidding l%c higher for American eagles and
Â»af allowing interest on gold transit, which
It seenje not disposed to do now. Notwith
etandins the prevailing ease of money rates
the surplus reserve* or New York hanks are
lower than usual at this period of the year,
and the use of the money continues active
in the interior. The recent supply to the mar
ket Srora the sub-treasury on account of the
j>ayment of bond prembuaa cannot continue
Indefinitely. Should it be interrupted while
gold exports are making inroads upon the
Â«ur|i!us of the t>anks the effect on money rates
would rieceMiarlly be promptly shown.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, April 24.â The grain and pro
vision markets were quiet but firm to-day,
wheat closing higher, corn He to %c
Improved and oats U@V*c better. Cables were
a strengthening factor. Provisions closed 7%'(f
12% c over yesterday. It was a placid, un
eventful middle-of-the-road sort of market In
wheat, not seeking to take spoils from any
body, but rather seeking to persuade the
mighty bulls and the growling bears to He
down together and be good. Considerable
swapping of May for July was done. The cash
business was not large. An incident of the
day was the heavy shipments, 478,000 bushels,
making shipments from Chicago for two days
SCO.OOO bushels. The sustaining Influences of
the market were the steadiness of Liverpool in
face of the decline here, the corn strength and
a lack of new bearish news. The weather was
all that could be desired by the farmers, mild
temperatures over the growing belt and show
ers where needed. May sold from 64* t ig647ic
early to 65Uc and closed U6?ic over yester
day at ejVtc; July from 66% c to 6634^j66}gc and
closed ?Â»c up at 6614 c.
Corn was quiet and strong, the most Im
portant market on the floor to-day. Cables
were strong and more rains caused appre
hension of delay In planting and moving re
serves. The beet item of the day was the
renewed export business which developed,
probably as a result of the .recent decline.
Considerable May was liquidated, but not on
a sufficient scale to depress the market. The
cash business was about 200,000 bushels, of
which r.lne loads were sold for export.
Th 3 oats market was firm, but trade was
dull. May closed H&Uc up at 22% c; July,
U*jVic up at 23"iC'23i,ic.
The provision market was quiet and rather
irregular. The opening was at prices over yes
terday's closing figures, but a small decline
followed because hogs were eaÂ«y at the yards.
The decline met good buying and the mar
ket reacted, closing firm. May pork closed
10c over yesterday at $12 75; July closed 7%c
Improved at $12 70: May lard closed 10c better
at $7 02%: July closed 7%c up at $7 10; May
ribs closed 10c higher at $6 92%; July, 10@12%c
better at $7*87 02%.

London Market.
NEW YORK. April 24.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were gloomy to-day, but
still Irregular and dull. War news was re
garded as more favorable, but the monetary
outlook Is disliked. Consols were down 5-16 c
and the war loan is down. The market Is
still talking of a new issue being Inevitable,
but obviously the market would have- to be
worked up first. Americans were quietly
cheerful. They opened >i a point above parity
and were idle until afternoon, although Ber
lin bought a few shares. New York pur
chased only slightly and finally sagged. Cop
pers spurted in sympathy with Americans and
the rise of 10 shillings in the price of metals.
Paris bought Tintos steadily, making them
rise one point. Anacondas were bought here,
causing an advance of 5-16. No gold was re
ceived or lost. Call money and bills were
steady and a brisker business with them was
done. Loans due the Bank of England were
renewed and a large business In discounts was
done. The prospectus of a cement manu
facturers' combination will be out In a few
wefeks. The capital is $8,000,000 and over
thirty businesses are- consolidated, giving a
practical monopoly in building cement.

POSTUM CEBEAL.
SUPPLANT COFFEE.
Belief of a Raymond IÂ«ady.
Mrs. T. T. Bartlett. Raymond. N. H..
cays: "I suspected that coffee was the
cause of my persistent dyspepsia and
terrible feeling of weakness and feint-
ness at the heart. It was hard to give
up coffr e, but when I got some Postum
Food Coffee and learned how to make
it properly, I quickly obtained relief
from the old troubles. The unpleasant
sensation of faintness at the heart has
entirely gone.
'When I first tried Postum. I failed
to notice the injunction to boil it fifteen
minutes, and so let it boil just a few
minutes, as I would coffee. I was
disappointed in the flavor, and did not
try it again until told by a friend that
this was cne of the absolute essentials.
I have since observed the rule and am
entirely satisfied with the drink. It is
simply perfect. I believe it to be the
beverage of the future and that it is des-
tined to supplant coffee everywhere.
"One of our business men here has
l^en improved in health by the use of
it. No one could wish to return to cof-
fee-drinking after properly testing your
deliehtful and healthful Postum Food
Coffee."
Made at the pure food factories of
the Postum Cereal Co.. Ltd.. Battle
Creek. Mich.
Valley. 111., shivered and moaned for more
than three hours last night while he wait
ed for the health authorities to send an
ambulance to remove him to the isolation
hospital.
Meantime residents in Wentworth avenue
between Sixty-fourth and Seventy-first
Ftreets, where, before he was taken into
custody at V o'clock, the man had entered
a dozen stores, were dreading a spread of
the disease among them. No one knew
how many had been exposed. It was the
reports made to the police of the man's
appearance and actions that led to his
being taken Into custody.
Dr. Spaldinc of the Health Department
reached the station at 11 o'clock. A hasty
examination satisfied him that Harris
was suffering from smallpox and he sum
moned the ambulance from the isolation
hospital. It was 12 o'clock before Harris
was released from his prison and 1 a. m.
before he was houFed In the hospital.
The police so far have been unable to
lenrn hoy- long the man has been In the
clty'cr whether he had contracted the
disease before or after he came here. The

WILL INVESTIGATE
JAPANESE IMMIGRATION
Treasury Department Orders Special
Agent to Proceed to This
Coast.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The Treasury j
Department has ordered a special agent â¢
to proceed to the Pacific Coast to invest!- j
gate the matter of the large intlux of i
Japanese coolies to this country within j
the last few months. The question is still j
troubling the immigration officials. Until >
two or three months ago the immigration !
of Japanese to the United States was |
small. It has become so heavy as to ex- j
cite suspicion that the men are coming |
here as contract laborers.
The Treasury Department has also re- '
quested the State Department to ask j
American Consuls to investigate the mat- !
ter and make a report. The Treasury De- ;
partment has not been Informed that the ;
Japanese Government, as stated yester
day, intends to put a stop to the imml- j
gratlon. as It does not desire Its people to
suffer hardships in this country while
waiting for employment, and the official I
investigation will continue.

WILL RETAIN
HER POSITION
AS ORGANIST
The trustees of the First Presbyterian
Church have Induced Miss Vlrginle de
Fremery to withdraw her resignation as
organist In the choir, the board having
acceded to her request for an increase of
salary. Miss de Fremery will continue
to serve the church in the capacity she
has occupied during the past twelve
years. The trustees have abandoned ne
gotiations which were commenced with a
prominent Eastern organist as soon as
Miss de Fremery's resignation had been
presented.
The young woman is one of the lead-
Ing factors In the equipment of the mag
nificent choir of the church. She has been
organist for so many years that the news
of her resignation provoked sentiments
of regret from the members of the
church. The trustees, however, accepted
her letter as llnal and proceeded to make
arrangements for her successor, when an
'effort succeeded toward the adjustment
of the question of salary, over which a
difference of opinion had arisen between
the organist and the trustees. That ended
to-day in practical accession to the or
ganist's request.
Miss de Fromery stands In the front
rank of church organists, and is highly
esteemed In this city. The news that she
Is to continue In the First Presbyterian
Church will be received with much Inter
est by the members of the church and the
congregation.
Speaking of the matter. Trustee "W. H.
Quinn said: "Miss de Fremery will not
leave us, as the trustees, after careful
consideration of the situation in the
church, have Induced her to withdraw her
resignation. The arrangements which
have been made are entirely satisfactory
to Miss de Fremery."

BILL PERMITTING ALIENS
TO SUE FOR INDEMNITY
Measure to Dispose of Possible For
eign Complications by Reason
of the Acts of Mobs.
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The Judi
ciary Committee of the House to-day di
rected a favorable report on the bill pro
viding means of indemnifying foreigners
injured in person or property through
mob violence or otherwise in this coun
try. The measure grows out of the
lynching of Italians In Louisiana and the
representations made by Italy through
Baron Fava. the Italian Embassador. As
an airs of this kind were of frequent oc
currence, each time threatening diplo
matic complications, the President rec
ommended a general measure of redress,
and the bill now reported seeks to carry
out this recommendation. The text of
the bill as finally adopted is as follows:
That any subject or citizen of a foreign state
claiming of the United States under a treaty or
upon the principles of international law in
demnity fcr injury to person or property may
bring suit for such claim In the Court of
Claims. Such sections and provisions of chap
ter 359 of the acts of ISS7 as are applicable to
the Court of Claims shall apply to and govern
the initiation of such suits and all subsequent
proceedings therein.
Provided, that the provisions of this act
shall apply only to the citizens or subjects of
those foreign states according like rights and
privileges to the citizens of the United States.
And, provided, further, that no suit shall be
brought after the expiration of two years from
the acciuing of such claim or cause of action.
And, provided, further, that It shall be a de
fense to such suit that the plaintiff has made
his domicile In the United States for more
thna a year continuously prior to the accruing
of such alleged claim or cause of action.
In case the bill becomes a law It is
understood that Its provision will cover
cases arising one year prior to the en
actment, which probably would Include
the last Italian affair in Louisiana.

ORATOR BRYAN TALKS
AT A KANSAS BANQUET
Explains Why He Has Relegated the
Silver Issue to the Back
ground.
WICHITA, Kan.. April 24.â William Jen
nings Bryan arrived here to-day at 11:05
a. m.. on his way from Texas to his home
in Lincoln. Neb. His visit was under the
auspices of the Sunflower League, a Dem
ocratic organization, embracing the
State. Mr. Bryan attended a meeting of
the club this afternoon, making a short
address, and later delivered an open-air
speech to 2000 people. To-night he was
the guest of honor at the annual banquet
of the Sunflower League. Mr. Bryan, In
the course of his banquet speech, said:
The public wonder* why I have dropped the
Â¦liver question. New measures are resting upon
us. but I shall never drop the silver question
until the little coteries of English financiers
cease to meet In secret and plan the laws of
this country- The difference between this cam
paign and that of l>'.'6 is that matters of trusts
and Imperialism have been injected and that
the East has become educated on the sliver
question. The East no longer regards Popu
lists as anarchists, but has come to respect
them. %
Referring to the Boer war he said j
I am sure of men's opinions by their sym
pathies. The sympathies of all our people are
with republics, and In the great contests that
are fought between kingdoms and republics we
know where to place the heart of Americans.
It is so to-day with the Boers, and I do not
cay that because I am against England. I
have some regard for England, because I am
part English myself. I am also part Irish
and part Scotch, but above all I am an Ameri
can.
As to colonial affairs Mr. Bryan said:
We are unalterably for the republic and
everlastingly agalnnt the empire and denounce
the present national administration for its
shameless attempt to unsettle the foundations
of our Government: for its abandonment of
the Monroe doctrine; for its attempt to thrust
our country Into European and Asiatic poll
tics, against which we have been warned by the
fathers; for its attempt to subjugate unwilling
and llberty-lovlng citizens, not to make them
citizens, but serfs; for Its attempt to adopt for
our country the English colonial system, as
foreign to our plan of government as a titled
aristocracy or a king; for its brazen disre
gard of our promise to the people of Cuba to
give them their freedom: for Its permanent
Increase of our standing army from 23.000 to
100.000 men, with no possible justification ex
cept to keep unwilling foreign peoples in sub
jugation; for Its notorious secret alliance with
England to be used as a menace to other
friendly nations, and for Its carpetbag govern
ment and unconstitutional tariff Inaugurated
in Porto Rico. All of these things, the natural
sequence of Republicanism and the first symp
tom of a military imperialism, we will forever
oppose.

tional problems than have fallen to the lot
of any predecessor save Washington and
Lincoln. His* renomination is recom
mended. The financial legislation of the
present Congress is commended. Regard
ing the recently acquired islands the plat
form says;
"We heartily support the administration
In the annexation of Hawaii and in the
acquisition of Porto Rico. Guam and the
Philippines. We intrust the future gov
ernment of the new possessions to Con
gress and the President, believing they
may lawfully control and govern them as
they deem best, and feeling assured that
they will give the islands every measure
of local self-government for which they
may show themselves fitted."

of relief and declared that if he had not
found out what was the matter with him
before many days more had passed he
would have been a candidate for an asy

It seems that while Lowry was pitching
hay at Haywards he got a grain of oats

to ache and several days afterward hla
head began to be filled with strange
noises. Lowry declared that he heard
everything from the note of the siren to
the latest thing In ragtime melody.
The grain which had lodged In Lowry's
ear had sprouted and considerable diffi
culty was experienced in removing it from
its position against the tympanum.

GIVEN CONTROL
OF FRANCHISES
IN PORTO RICO
President Must Pass Upon
All Concessions to
Corporations.
House Adopts the Foraker Emer
gency Resolution With Its
Two Eestrictive Amend-
WASHINGTON, April 24.â The House
to-day, Hill of Connecticut objecting,
adopted the Foraker emergency resolu
tion to continue the present officers in
Porto Rico in office until the appointments
are made under the civil government act
as amended by the committee on insular
affairs. The amendments require that all
franchises shall be approved by the Presi
dent before they become operative and
place certain restrictions upon chartered
corporations, such as the Issuing of stock
or Donds. except for cash and inhibiting
real estate corporations or the holding of
real estate by corporations, except such
as is necessary to carry out the purposes
for which they are created.
About twenty pages of the postofflce
appropriation bill were disposed of. the
only substantial amendment adopted being
one to give extra compensation to letter
carriers who work in excess of forty
eight hours a week.
The Foraker resolution carried two
amendments placed upon it by the Insular
Affairs Committee â one to provide that
franchises should be approved by the
President and another placing certain re
strictions upon charters, corporations,
etc. It was arranged that the resolution
should be debated for one hour.
Hill of Connecticut raised a point of or
der against the amendments. Williams
paid that information had come to the
Insular Affairs Committee that all sorts
of companies were preparing to invade
Porto Rico, and the committee considered
that the proposed restrictions should be
placed upon them to prevent a great
scandal "there. He said he could not un
derstand why the point of order had been
raised.
Moody of Massachusetts, prefacing his
remarks with the statement that he re
gretted exceedingly that the point of or
der had come from his (the Republican)
side of the House, raised the point of or
der that Hill's point of order had come too
late. This was sustained by the Speaker.
Cooper, in closing the debate, said that
one of the Republican members of his
rninmittee hnrl informed him that he had
been approached by a capitalist who had
stated mat a company was being formed
to buy up all the mortgages on the island.
The amended resolution was agreed to
without division and the House resumed
consideration of the postofflce appropria
tion bill.
GIVES THE LIE
TO COUNSEL FOB
MINERS' UNION
Exciting Scene Before the
Wardner Investigating
Committee.
Bartlett Sinclair Insults Attorney
Robinson and Is Attacked
While in the Witness
Chair.
WASHINGTON. April 24.â An exciting
encounter occurred at the Coeur d'Alena
Investigation this afternoon, when Bart
lett Sinclair, who was on the stand, gave
the He to Attorney Robertson, represent
ing the miners. Robertson sprang for
Sinclair, aiming a blow at his face. Sev
eral Congressmen intervened and held
Robertson and Sinclair from coming to
gether. An officer appeared on the scene,
but his services were not required, a?
order had been restored.
The encounter occurred while Mr. Sin
clair was testifying: concerning his order
forbidding a meeting at the miners' cem
etery on July 11 last commemorating the
deaths resulting In the riots of 1592. He
said his notice did not forbid women from
assembling to put flowers on the graves.
Attorney Robertson contradicted the wit
ness and said it did specifically prohibit
women from assembling.
"Do you ask that as a question or state
it as a fact?" asked Sinclair.
"I state it as a fact," replied Mr., Rob
ertson.
"It is a lie." responded Sinclair.
Robertson made a lunge at Sinclair, but
the distance was too great to permit a
blow. Representatives Sulzer, Hay, Esch
and other members sprang forward to
stop the fracas.
In the few minutes that the melee was
at its heipht members were standing on
and jumnlng over the large committee
table, seeking to get at the contestants.
The latter were in a confused tangle of
chairs and witnesses on the farther side
of the table.
After Robertson's first lunge he rushed
on Sinclair, who was sitting in the wit
ness stand, unprepared for the onslaught.
The two went over in a crash on the floor
and were then separated. No actual blows
were struck. Sinclair, when order was re
stored, resumed his seat in the witness
chair and, after vigorous cautionary re
marks by the chairman against such dis
order, resumed his recital. Neither of the
contestants showed any outward mark of
the affray.
Mr. Sinclair completed his direct testi
mony during the afternoon. In view of
the excitement it was deemed best not to
open the cross-examination, 'which will
be conducted by Mr. Robertson, and the
committee adjourned until 10 a. m. to
morrow.
Mr. Sinclair left the committee-room
Joking over the occurrence.
The investigating committee in execu
tive session to-day voted adversely and
on party lines on a motion by Representa
tive Sulzer to summon as witnesses Lieu
tenant Governor Hutchinson of Idaho;
Father Becker, a priest who sought admis
sion to the prison, and Edward Boyce.
president of the Western Federation of
Miners, who was mentioned in Governor
Steunenberg's testimony. A motion by
Representative Slayden of Texas to limit
each witness to six hours was similarly
disposed of.

FOOTPAD GROWS BOLD
AND USES HIS PISTOL
A. Rodgers Shot in the Shoulder While
Trying to Escape From a
Highwayman.
A RODGERS, a young butcher, re
siding at 916 Pine street, was held '
0 up and shot in the right shoulder
by a masked footpad shortly after ,
7 o'clock last night. The shooting occur
red on Jackson street, near Franklin.
After the encounter the wounded man â¢
hurried to the. Receiving Hospital un
assisted and secured treatment.
The bullet struck half an inch inside the '
edge of the scapula and followed across
the sheath of the shoulder muscles and ,
lodged In the muscles of the right arm.
Drs. Armistead and Thompson probed for
the leaden missile but without success.
They decided to resort to the X ray to lo
cate the bullet.
Accoring to Rodgers' version of the
affair he was walking up the Jackson
street grade, between Franklin and
Gough. accompanied by a young woman,
when the footpad, who had been follow
ing in their wake, touched him on the
shoulder. As Rodgers turned the high
wayman pointed a pistol at him and or
dered him to throw up his hands. He
obeyed with his right hand, the left being
grasped tightly by his. companion.
"I asked him what he wanted," said
Rodgers, "and he replied, 'I want your
money.' At that moment the lady pulled
me away and my upraised arm was low-
Detectives McMahon, Reynolds, Deenan,
Wren, Sullivan, Graham and a half dozen
more were detailed to scour the Western
Addition for the footpad.
It is believed- that the highwayman went
downtown soon after shooting Rodgers.
Being well dressed, he was enabled to
mingle with the crowds along Market
street without attracting attention.
At a late hour last night the entire de
tective force of the Police Department was
put on the case and every section of the
city Is being searched for the criminal.

To Get Rid of Hoodlums.
A meeting of citizens living In the Yidn
ity of Bay street and Montgomery avenue
met last night to devise means of ridding
the neighborhood of the hoodlums that
congregate there. The chairman was In
structed to appoint a committee to confer
with the Board of Supervisors and Police
Commission regarding the matter.
TO CLOSE ALL THE
STORES ON MAY DAY
Street Railway Companies Making
Preparations to Handle Teachers'
Picnic Crowds.
There is a movement on foot to have all
the stores In the city closed on May 1. It
was started by those in charge of the
teachers' annuity fund benefit, who are
working night and day to make the com
ing event a success. Many of the teach
ers suggested that the exercises In Glen
Park would be more largely attended it
the clerks and other employes of the
downtown stores and wholesale places
could be given a day off from their labors
on that occasion.
A number of the larger employers have
been interviewed and nearly all of them
agreed to the suggestion, with the proviso
that the closing of stores be general. Be
tween now and .the 1st â¢ of May nearly
every business man in the city will be ap
proached with the- request that he close
shop on May 1.
The promoters of the movement are of
the opinion that they will succeed and
that nearly every clerk and employe In
the city will have an opportunity to enjoy
the outing with his family and friends.
All the spare men and cars of both the
San Francisco and San Mateo and the
Market-street companies are being made
available for the big Mayday festival. The
former line will have its nineteen new big
cars out on that day, besides all of the
other remodeled ones, which have .been
receiving an overhauling in the shops dur
ing the past six months. This company
has been figuring how it could get suf
ficient power to propel these additional
cars, as the motor power of the plant is
not sufficient for the extra work. The
solution of the problem has been reached
by the offer of the Market-street company
to furnish the San Francisco and San Ma
teo company with all the extra power
that may be needed on this occasion.
By the completion of the tunnel leading
into Glen Park along Bosworth street the
Market-street company is enabled to run
its cars into the park direct from Mis
sion street. To meet the tremendous
tratjlc on Mayday Manager Vining of the
Market-street system has evolved a plan,
which he thinks will be satisfactory tp
the public. For the accommodation of the
people residing* in the Western Addition
all cars intended to enter the grounds
direct by way of Fillmore street will start
from Broadway and Fillmore street and
go straight to the park without transfer
ring. For the Mission people the starting
point will be the carhouse on Mission and
Twenty-ninth street, thence direct to the
park. Persons taking Valencia-street cars
will have to walk one block from the
southern end of Valencia street to th&
carhouse. It is -estimated that 150.000 per-;
sons will be transported to and from the
park by the two lines of electric cars. All
cars south of Market street will transfer
to the Mission cars at Twenty-ninth
street.
OFFERS THE CITY A
FINE WATER SYSTEM
Lake Tahoe and San Francisco Works
Agrees to Construct the Plant
for ?21,215,000.
The Lake Tahoe \ and San Francisco
Water Works yesterday submitted an In
ventory of its property and works to the
Board of Supervisors. The inventory was
accompanied by a definite offer to deliver
water to this city at a pressure of 300 feet
above the sea level. The offer is outlined
In the following five propositions:
The company offers to construct the
works, with a capacity of 30,000,000 gallons
daily, single pipe line, for the sum of $17,
960,000, or with two pipe lines from the
reservoir for $20,405,000. For a capacity of
100,000,000 gallons daily the sum of $21,215,000
will be charged. For a capacity of 100.000,
000 gallons daily above the Intake reser
voir and 60,000,000 gallons dally to San
Francisco, single pipe line, the price will
be $28,772,000, br with two pipe fines $32,
600,000.
The time in" which the company binds
itself to finish the works under any of the
propositions will be five years. The differ
ence in the foregoing estimates and the
one made September 23, ISS9, to bring 30 -
000,000 gallons daily for the sum of $15 000*.
000. is on account of increased thickness of
metal used, the factors of safety being
much higher than was intended.
Wholesalers Suffer Loss.
Wholesale dealers In wire nails and -wire
fencing In this city say they have lost at
least $100,000 In the last few days by rea
son of an arbitrary reduction by the man
ufacturers in the price of these goods, of
which reduction they were first notified
last Saturday by John W. Gates, chair
man of the American Steel and Wire
Company. The reason assigned by Gates
is that there is an overproduction. The
New York correspondents of the San
Francisco houses have written that the
move came about by reason of the short
ing of stocks, and that the shutting down
of twelve plants controlled by the com
pany was ordered to affect speculative
values.
IN MEMORY OF COMRADES
WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY
Services Held by George H. Thomas
Post, Grand Army of the
Republic.
George H. Thomas Post. G. A. R., held
services last night in Red Men's building

J. Staples and F. S. Douty, comrades
who passed away during 1533-1900.
The memorial service of the Grand
Army of the Republic was read by Com
mander A. Mautner. after which J. H.
Roberts, the adjutant, read the records
of the deceased comrades, closing with
a peroration. Rev. J. S. Thomas delivered
the address of the evening. In addition
there was a programme of appropriate
vocal and instrumental music; also reci
tations that were listened to by a large
audience. "W. J. Watson, A. J. Vlning.
Hugh M. Burke and A. D. Cutler were
the committee on exercises.
SF the gallant, fierce-fighting Boers
knew of the hearty sentiment favoring
them expressed at the benefit meeting of
their sympathizers at Metropolitan
Temple last night they would be nerved for
harder battle. The house was filled with
an audience that hissed every mention
of the British nation and cheered every
mention of the heroic Boers.
Judge Cooney, chairman of the Trans
vaal committee of California, presided,
and after announcing several substantial
subscriptions .to the fund for the support
of the widows and orphans of the Boer
patriots introduced the speaker of the
evening, John P. Irish.
Colonel Irish ably reviewed the condi
tions which led up to the present war and
incidentally roasted the British for what
he called the worst kind of oppression.
He told the history of the Free State and
the Transvaal in a manner that aroused
genuine enthusiasm and he was continu
ally cheered during his discourse.
In addition to the oratory there was a
musical programme under the direction
of Professor Franz Dietz that charmed
the big gathering. The singing of the
choruses was really excellent and there
was not too much of it. The programme
follows:
Chairman of the evening, M. Cooney, presl-
GUILTY, DESPITE
RANK PERJURY
Chan Kam Quey Proved to Be
Illegally in the United
States.
The Depraved Woman Swore That White Wit
nesses Had Perjured Themseives and
That She Was an American.
KIM Qi El , or, as she gave her name,
Chan Kam Quey, repudiated the
confession made by her to Chinese
Inspector Gardner. Chief Dunn of
the Chinese Burea.u and Miss Donaldina
Cameron, matron of the Presbyterian Chi
nese Home Mission, and went on the stand
yest'-rday in Commissioner Heacock's
court and swore that those witnesses had
j>*rjured themselves. She had previously
lia.d two private interviews with J. N. L".
Wilson, her attorney, the last being yes
terday morning and lasting an hour. Com
missioner Heacock will recommend her
deportation.
On the preceding day Mr. Wilson made
an arrangement with O. D. Jones, official
Chinese interpreter of the United States
District Attorney, to interview the woman
at the mission home. Jones was to meet
Mr. Wilson at iii o'clock yesterday morn-
Ing in the office of the District Attorney.
Mr. Jones waited until 11, when he re
ceived a Up through the telephone that
Wilson was at the home with a Chinaman
in consultation with the woman. He hur
ried to the home and found that Mr. Wll
eon had concluded an interview of an
hour'B duration and that his services were
not required. Then it was that Jones
realized that he had been holding the sack
and the candle in the old game of hunting
tnipe.
liert Herrington. the lawyer who had
tried to kidnap Chan Kam Quey at May
field, did not appear. Marshal B. Wood
worth. Assistant United States Attorney,
appeared for the Government.
The defendant was the first witness. She
testified that she was born In San Fran
cisco, and was married to Wong Ling
Ding in this city a few weÂ«ks ago.
"1 did not tell Dr. Gardner that what I
had testified to in Mayfleld was false,"
paid the witness. "I did not tell him that
JJert Herrington forced me to testify to
what was< not true or that he had threat
ened to put a bullet through my head or
that either Ay one Fong or my husband
Wor.g Ling Ding had forced me to testify
falsely. I am 21 years old, find I was born
.hi Washington streetâ l don't know at
what number. It is not a fact that I
came here from China two years ago with
the Omaha Kair people, and I didn't tell
Dr. Gardner so. My father and mother
â¢lied in this city â my father before I was
born and my mother when I was a few
months old. I have never been in China.
I never made any statement to Miss Cam
eron through an interpreter or otherwise
that 1 was born In Shanghai and that I
)inÂ«l been at the fair In Omaha,
"Mrs. Brown at the Presbyterian Mls-
Fion asked me to go upptairs with her and
tried to sÂ»t me to admit that I had come
here for the Omaha Fair. I said I would
not admit it. even if . they killed me. I
never said to Chief Dunn of the Chinese
Bureau or to any one else that I was
afraid that Wong Fong and Wong Ling
iJing would be hanged, and that taking
pity on them I testified falsely at May
lield. Wong I-ing Ding had a wife, but he
has no wife now but me."
While the woman was making this de
nial the expression of disgust on Commis
sioner Heacock's face deepened, and when
Lawyer Wilson mildly objected to a ques
tion the Commissioner broke in with: "I
don't think the questions are of much con
sequence now. I certainly cannot believe
this woman, for her statements are in di
rect conflict with the statements of the
Federal officers. I have come to the con
clusion that she is testifying falsely, and
you are of the Fame opinion."
Lawyer Wilson replied that he did not
think so.
Mr. Woodworth subjected the woman to
a severe cross-examination, in the course
of which she admitted that she had re
sided for a year in a bagnio in Bakers
alley.
Mr. Wilson admitted that his client was
a depraved woman. Then followed the
woman's statement, that after the May
field trial she had remained in Bert Her
rington's house with Wong Ling Ding for
several days. Her husband, she said, was
a physician and owned a gold mine in
Trinity County.
Mr. Wilson asked that a continuance be
granted for the purpose of securing the
attendance of Mr. Herrington.
"The press has said some very ugly
things about him," said Wilson, "and he
ought to be allowed to explain. He is a
gentleman, and I can vouch for him as a
man of honor." The court denied the re
quest.
Miss Donaldina Cameron of the Presby
terian Mission Home. Dr. J. E. Gardner
and Chief Inspector Dunn reiterated the
statement that the defendant had con
fessed to them that she had perjured her
self and that she was not entitled to re
main in the United States.
Mr. Wilson offered to prove that the de
fendant had married Wong Ling Ding a
few weeks ago: that he was a physician
and owned a gold mine in Trinity County
He claimed that the defendant was enti
tled to remain as the wife of a merchant
irrespective of the fact that she was born
here.
"There is testimony before me." said
Commissioner Heacock. "that the defend
ant came from China for the purpose of
taking part in the exposition at Omaha.
She was entitled to remain here for three
months after the close of the exposition.
She had no right to remain in the country
for any other purpose, and she could not
take upon herself the status of the wife
of a merchant or a physician. I find that
she was born in China, and I shall recom
mend her deportation."
Peace Barry's court yesterday. Callender
sued for $190, which he claimed McKenzia
owed him aa the proceeds of a benefit con
cert. The vocal teacher testified that the
concert was an artistic but not a financial
success and that only $31 was realized.
which was just enough to cover expenses.
Judge Barry reserved his decision.

GENTLEMANLY HIGHWAYMAN AT WORK
57y> HIGHWAYMAN' with the manners
//_\\ of Claude DuvaJ, the famous rob
// \ her of old, is operating in the
Western Addition. During the
jiast week he has hold up several people
at the point of a pistol and robbed them.
About S o'clock Sunday night, while Ed
xrard Northrup and his best girl were ad
miring a building which is In the course
of erection at Washington and Laguna
streets, they were suddenly confronted by
a well-dressed young man. After doffing
his hat and apologizing for interrupting
them he quietly drew a pSftol from his
ovtrcoat pocket* and. pointing it at North
rup, demanded hi? money. Northrup'p
companion, thinking he intended to rob
her. took out her purse and started to
hand it to the highwayman.
"I don't want your money, my dear
lady." apologetically remarked the pol
ished knight of the road. "You'll need it
jx-rhaps to buy. Fime things that are dear
to the feminine hf-art."
While thus addressing the woman the
robber kept his revolver trained on North
rup. who was nervously searching his
pockets for his loose change. Taking out
i 5 cents, he handed it to the highwayman.
"Sorry you haven't any more." remark
ed the rubber, "but this will buy me a
necktie."
Turning to Northrup's lady friend, who
was on the verge of collapsing, the mod
ern Claude Duval bade her to cheer up.
"Th*>re is no necessity for being alarm
ed." he remarked, again lifting his hat.
"Perhaps a quiet Ftroll with your gentle
man friend might do you some good."
Then, turning to Xorthrup. he ordered
him to "take the lady for a walk."
"Don't turn around." he commanded,
"or I might be compelled to take a shot
at you, much as I would dislike to."
After the couple had gone a short dis
tance the robber walked along Laguna
street and was soon lost in the darkness.
Northrup described him as being about
20 years of age. rather tall, with a light
mustache. He was tastefully dressed and
wore a light overcoat of the latest style.
As soon a? the robbery was- reported to
the police several detectives were imme
diately dispatched to the scene of the
hold-up, but after a thorough search they
faii<-d to get a trace of the robber.
John J. Deane was also held up Monday
night, presumably by the same man. He
was accompanied by his wife, and when
near Broadway and Fillmore street he
was confronted by the robber, who, after
covering him with his pistol, ordered him
to "shell out." Deane gave him $3 50 and
the highwayman departed apparently sat
isfied.

Â»
Another meeting of the Fifth Congres
sional District Republican Committee
was held last night at the office of W.
H. Cobb in the Parrott building to rectify
a curious blunder.
At the meeting held last Thursday so
much haste was displayed in adopting
the caucus programme to appoint dele
gates to the State and District conven
tions that the committeemen forgot to fix
a time and place for holding the Congres
sional District convention to select dele
gates to the national gathering. They
also neglected to fix the representation of
Santa Clara and San Mateo counties un
der the apportionment provided by the
Republican State Central Committee.
In order to correct â¢ these mistakes and
make the record clear the committee was
convened last night. Max Goldberg,
chairman, presided and W. H. Cobb acted
as secretary. J. Alva Watt, holding the
proxies of Alvinza Hayward and R. Dono
van attended.
J. D. Mackenzie, E. I. Robinson. F.
R. Danforth and G. H. Fairchlld, commit
teemen, were also present. Judge Dibble,
who is not a member of the committee,
â¢â¢graced the occasion" with his presence.
The following revised call was submit
ted by Mr. Uatt and adopted by the
committee:
Whereas. By the call of the National Repub
lican Committee the selection of delegates to
the National Republican Convention to be held
In the city of Philadelphia on the 19th day of
June, 1900, was referred to the Congressional
l>istrict committees throughout the several Con
gressional districts of the United States, there
by devolving upon this committee the duty of
providing for the selection of said delegates;
and whereas, the State Central Committee of
California has fixed the apportionment of dele-

bly District, eight delegates, and under which
apportionment the city and county of San
Francisco Is entitled to 112 delegates; and
whereas, by agreement between the sub-com
mittees heretofore appointed between the
Fourth and Fifth Congressional Districts, the
Fifth District is entitled to have that portion
of the district lying within the city and county

of this State, approved March 3, 1599, con
ventions to nominate Congressmen must be
chosen under and pursuant to said law; and
Whereas, No primary election can be held
under said or any law until the second Tues
day of August, A. D. 1900; and
Whereas, In the absence of any such prim
ary election law the holding of a primary
election would be without the safeguards
against the frauds that notoriously have ac
companied every primary election held in this
city for many years past; and
Whereas. The Congressional committee of the
Sixth Congressional District, Including the city
of Los Angeles, the second city of this State,
has resolved to appoint the delegates to said
State and Congressional district conventions;
and
Whereas. This committee Is advised that a
majority of the counties of the State have, ow
ing to the absence of any law controlling the

The members of the committee are In
danger of being plunged into a serious
muddle by the failure of James Alva Watt
to produce his authority for appointing
them. Mr. Watt claimed this authority
was vested in him by a resolution of the
Republican District Convention of Sep
tember. 189 S. When the committee met a
few weeks ago and organized the resolu
tion was not produced. W. H. Cobb re
ferred to It at a meeting last Thursday
night and Mr. Watt promised to produce
the records at the next meeting. This he
again failed to do last night, nor was a
call made for the document which he says
exists.
