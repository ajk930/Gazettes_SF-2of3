they are not likely to run such a risk, es
pecially as they have partially accom

forces from Bloemfontein on long marches
and have thereby delayed the advance on
Pretoria.
The Morning Post, commenting upon the
difficulty Lord Roberts Is experiencing.
assert* the wisdom of arranging for a j
steady flow of reinforcements.
The report that a Boer commando was
at Frankfort proved to be without foun
dation, but evidently there is a large force
opposing Lord Methuen.
The Bloemfonteln correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph says: "The resistance of
the Boors at Leeuw Kop was contempt
ible, considering the strength of their po
sition. They escaped in an easterly direc
tion, the guards falling to get quite
around them."
The Daily Telegraph has the following
from Boshof, dated Monday, April 23:
"The Boers are closing in on Boshof.
Their nearest laager is five miles distant. |
Communication with Kimberley Is still

The Cape Town correspondent of the !

close behind the steamer Milos, which on
Saturday landed 1000 Japanese here, an
other coolie steamer laden to her capacity
with a human cargo of 10G0 Japanese im
migrants arrived at Williams Head quar
antine station this afternoon. This was
the steamer Braemar. one of the Northern
Pacific liners on the Portland route. She
was diverted from her usual run this trip

The first steamer to be sighted by the

British freight steamer of 3[KO tons, on
her way from Shanghai via Singapore for

natives of Mlnicoy Island the Count pre

The yacht Tolna has haÂ»l a most ro

the Count's bride. Miss Ellen Margin, by
her father. There were many adventures
at Honolulu and Samoa before the Tolna

DEATH'S SUMMONS FOR
THE DUKE OF ARGYLL
LONDON. April 24.â George Douglass
Campbell, Duke of Argyll, died this
morning.
George Douglass Campbell, the
eighth Duke of 'Argyll, was born at Ar
dincaplo Castle, Dumbartonshire, Scot
land, on April 30. 1523. As the head of the
great nouse of Campbell, one of the old
est and most renowned of the Scottish
peerage, and the father of the husband of
one of the Queen's daughters, he has well
been reckoned one of the leading noble
men in the United Kingdom. Besides
this, however, he well earned in other
ways the distinction of being one of the
foremost noblemen of his time. Before
he succeeded his father in 1547 he had be
come well known as an author on politi
cal economic and religious subjects, had
made his mark as a politician and gained
renown as a public speaker. He carried
more titles than any other nobleman In
Scotland. With Lgrd Rosebery he had
the honor of being both a Knight of the
Garter and. Knight of the Thistle, a dis
tinction enjoyed by no other nobleman.
He has filled many positions of honor In
cluding those of Lord of Privy Seal (1553).
Postmaster General (1555), Lord Rector of
Glasgow Unlversltv (1555), Secretary of
State for India (18(58) and Master, of Her
Majesty's Household in Scotland. His
Grace was a- frequent speaker in the
House of Peers on such subjects as Jew
ish emancipation, the Scottish marriage
bill, corrupt practices at elections bill,
sugar duties, foreign affairs, ecclesiastical
titles bill, Scottish law of entail and the
repeal of the paper duties. His writings
on the BHbjects mentioned above have
been voluminous He is probably best re
membered' for his rellglo-sclentlflc contro
versy with the late Professor Huxley, in
which he was widely credited with-hav
ing come off victor. .
The : Irfite Duke of Argyll.
. The Argyll estates, to which the Mar
quis nf Lome now succeeds, comprise 170 -
000 acres besides large properties in Lon
don, Glasgow and other cities. The Duke
was thrice married and leaves three sons
and six daughters. -To illustrate the esti
mation, In â¢ which he was held by the com
mon'people of Scotland the story Is told
of an old clansman in: Glasgow, who, on
being informed' thatVArgyll's son was to
marry the Queen's daughter, remarked:
"Ah! what a proud? woman -the Queen
must be this day."--'* ..... . ......

planters in California. These are booked
direct to San Francisco. The greater
j number are .booked, to Vancouver: more
[than six hundred are^ going there. The
i others are divided between Victoria, Port
land, Seattle and Tacoma.
The Empress of China is coming close
after the Braemar. with 660 of the tiny
brown people, and following her. having
left a week later. Is the Tosa Maru, on
which/according to cabled advices to the
ofllcials at the quarantine station, there
are no less than 1600. This will bring the
number of Japanese arriving here since
the beginning of the year to nearly 10.000,
and of these more than half have arrived
during the month of April.
A veritable emigration fever seems to
have struck Japan, a fever similar to that
which entices the American to Cape
Nome. Emigration agents are distributing
printed copies of letters and photographs?
from Japanese agents on this side
throughout Japan and this has caused the
big stampede to America, the Cape Nome
of the Japanese.
'As a result of investigations made here
and at Vancouver it has been plalnly
shown that Victoria and Vancouver are
the distributing points' for the Incoming
hordes* and nothing more. A very small
percentage remain' in Canada. All are
bound to the United States and the United
States; contract labor and pauper immi
gration laws are being openly violated, for
hundreds of the. Japanese are coming un
der contracts. Some go to work in Cali
fornia, but, the greater percentage come
to work on the Northern Pacific, Great
Northern and some other American rail
way lines. The systems of getting the
undesirable Immigrant Into the United
States are many. On the arrival here -and
at Vancouver the most presentable are
selected from the crowds and these are
carried In comparatively small numbers
by the ferry steamers running to Seat
tle or by the Seattle and International
Railway from Vancouver. Many hundreds
have gone; over the border In this way
during last week. " Of the modus operand!
of beating the pauper immigration laws
T. H. Yamma, proprietor of a large
Japanese. employment agency here and at
Vancouver, says:
"It Is easy. We all work together. Sup
pose a San Francisco, Seattle or Tacoma
agency, wants Japanese. They send here
or to Vancouver. They go to men who
build railways and when they get work
for men they telegraph how many men
they want and we send them right away.
We give each, man $30 so that he can get
past the United States Immigration in
spector Â¦ and . when the men have been
passed they give the $30 back to an agent,
who sends the money back to us and we
can give It to the next man. That's how
we do it." Â¦
Other revelations came to light to-day
in connection with the underground rail
way, system over which hundreds of Jap
anese are nightly passed across the
boundary- It has been shown that they
go to New Westminster and Steveston oh
the Fraser. ostensibly for the purpose of
fishing for the canneries or building sal
mon traps, and under cover of darkness
numbers are nightly rowed across the
boundary; bay. from the mouth, of .the

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL. WASHING
TON, April 23.â Turkey has again
admitted her liability for outrages
suffered by missionaries In Arme
nia and has promised that she will pay
the damages demanded by the United
States.
Mr. Grlscom, American Charge d'Af
faires in Constantinople; has cabled to
this effect to the Department of State,
and his message was the subject of dis
cussion at the Cabinet meeting to-day.
At a conference which Mr. Griscom held
en Saturday with the Sultan the latter
verbally repeated v.hat he has on three
previous occasions said to Minister
Straus. While his declarations do not
materially change the situation, the au
thorities are satisfied that the Turkish
sovereign appreciates that the United
States. is in earnest and it is the purpose
to continue the pressure which has been
applied in order to secure prompt settle
ment. Â¦Â»
It is emphatically denied by ofllcials of
the State Department that the Sultan has
promised to pay the claims on the condi
tion that they be placed on the same basis
as those which European powers hold
against the Sublime Porte.
What missionary authorities are in
clined to regard as more important than
the payment of indemnity is the nego
tiations for the re-estubllshment of the
mission school at Harpoot. So far as ne
gotiations for Indemnity are concerned. It
is stated that no ultimatum has yet been
presented nor will it be. provided pay
ment is made as promised by the Sultan.
It Is stated by the authorities that there
Is no occasion for discussion by the Euro
pean Cabinets of their attitude in the
event of the dispatch of an American fleet
to Turkish waters. There is no present
Intention of going to war with Turkey.
Information which the authorities re-
ceived from Constantinople to-day and as
surances which have been given them by
the Turkish Minister, who called at the
department this afternoon, satisfy them
that the incident will be speedily dosed.
Minister Straus also saw Secretary Hay
and this afternoon returned to New York.
It was pointed out this afternoon by a
friend of the Turkish Minister that the
position of the Turkish Government was
not well understood In the United States
nor fairly judged. Not only is the Turk
ish Government not responsible according
to International law for damages which
occurred at Harpoot, according to this
gentleman, but if It were the value placed
by the missionaries upon the losses they
sustained Is excessive. The total per
sonal losses of eleven missionaries are
placed at $29,724.
HOPES ABDUL HAMID

PARIS. April 23.â The Temps to-< Jay
published a long article on the Turko-
Amerlcan situation, reviewing the cir
cumstances in a manner quite friendly
to the United States, and expressing con
fidence that Turkey will pay the indem
nity demanded by the United States. Re
ferring to the alleged intention of the
United 3tates xn occupy Smyrna. In de
fault of payment, the Temps says:
"The United States would not. perhaps,
bo sorry to display a little before the
eyes, not only of the Sultan, but of entire
Europe the newly acquired glitter of their
navy, crowned with the laurels of Cavite
and Santiago. The , occupation of Smyr

to hope that Abdul Hamld will see the
madness of resistance, which, for such a
trivial object, would bring about such
serious results."

JAPAN MAY PUT A.
STOP TO EMIGRATION
Government Believes That TfflnT of
Laborers Is Due to Rivalry Be
Â¦ tween Companies.
WASHINGTON. April 23.â Information
has reached Washington to the effect that
the Japanese Government itself, and with
out awaiting a request from the United
States, is about to take steps to restrict
the emigration of Japanese coolie3 to the
United States.
It is asserted that the figures relative
to this emigration have been magnified,
and that, as a matter of fact, there are
now not more than about 15.000 or 16.000
Japanese within the limits of the United
States outside of Hawaii. It is said that
such emigration as has lately cceurrej] has
resulted entirely from the competition of
the two great Japanese immigration so
cieties â that the laborers have been prac
tically brought here under the delusion
that there were untold opportunities for
work at great wages. The Japanese Gov
ernment is Interested in protecting Its
people from the hardships resulting from
such impositions, and that is the reason
it Intends to establish restrictions upon
the outward flow.
It Is said, however, that the Government
would never contemplate with equanimity
legislation by the United States directed
exclusively against Japanese immigra
tion, for, though perfectly willing to
abide by the results, of any legislation on
the subject of immigration that affects all
outside nations alike. discrimination
against Japanese -would certainly have
most disastrous effects upon the large,
and growing trade between the United
States and Japan.
The position of the Japanese Govern
ment upon that point is that the Japanese
immigrant is not for a moment to be
classed with the Chinese coolie.

CALCULATED TO ENLIST
AMERICAN SYMPATHY
LONDON, April 24.â The Vienna corres
pondent of the Times says: "The Boer
peace commissioners will not be received
either at Vienna. Berlin. St. Petersburg
or Rome. It Is well that the United States
should know how the mission has fared in
Europe and the temper of Europe toward
the United States. The widespread hos
tility to the United States which Is con*
stantly manifested on the Continent Is a
factor to be reckoned with, as the United
States will doubtless discover at the next
renewal of commercial treaties."
The correspondent goes on, at great
length', to argue that "the latent feeling
of hostility to the United States," though
not of a serious character. Is yet strong
enough to "make an opportunity of put
ting a spoke In America's wheel very wel
come," and he adds that "on this account
America will probably realize the desira
bility of maintaining a good understand
ing with England."

UP POSTOFFICE
APPROPRIATION
Discusses Rural Free De
livery and Pneumatic
Tubs Service.
Loud Opposes the Latter Innovation,
Saying That It Cannot Be Suc
cessfully and Economi
cally Used.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â The House
to-day entered upon the consideration of
the Postofflce appropriation bill, and the
general debate which closed with the ad
journment this afternoon was devoted
largely to discussion of pertinent matters.
The minority of the committee dissented
from the provisions in the bill relating
to the extension of the pneumatic tube
service, special fart mail facilities and
the cost of railroad transportation, and
these were the main subjects of conten
tion.
Loud of California, chairman of the
Postoffice Committee, explained the pro
visions of the bill, which carries $113,
334,800.
"Will not the increase of half a mil
lion for pneumatic tube service involve
millions in the near future?" asked Moody
of Massachusetts.
"That is about it," replied Loud, who
added: "The service should stop alto
gether or be extended. I have argued that
it should be stopped, but Congress has
seen tit to continue It."
Foreign countries employing the tube
service charge extra compensation for its
use. It was used only, for the transmis
sion of telegrams and special delivery let
ters. He declared his opinion to be that
the tube system could not be successfully
and economically administered.
"I hope to God." said he, "that Congress
will have the strength and wisdom to pre
vent the Government from embarking in
any more enterprises than it is now in."
Bell of Colorado attacked the exorbi
tant charge of railroads for carrying the
mails, which averaged 8 cents per pound.
The express rate from Boston to Chicago,
he said, was less than 1 cent .per pound.
Why should the Government pay more?
Since IS7S railroad rales had decreased 3a
per cent and passenger rates l~\-> per cent,
but the rate for carrying the mails had re
mained unchanged.
Bromwell of Ohio thought rural free de
livery service should be kept within the
experimental stage. He opposed the ex
tension of tho pneumatic tube service and
the special railroad mall facilities.
Games of Tennessee discussed trusts and
Sibley of Pennsylvania concluded the
day's debate. "We are engaged to-day."
he said, "in the commercial conquest of
the world, and anything which expedites
communication, whether It is rural free
delivery, fast mail subsidies or pneumatic
tube service, will command my support."
He added that if w*> desired to control the
markets of the world we must be able to
communicate with them quicker than any
other country. If 25 per cent of the com
pensation of the railroads was taken away
the efficiency of the service must suffer to
that extent.
Bill* were passed to dispose of the aban
doned Fort Buford #nilitary reservation In
North Dakota and Montana; to extend the

SEEKING MEN
FOR PLACES IN
PORTO RICO
President Enlists the Aid of
the Members of His
Cabinet.
Secretary Root's Explanation of the
Granting of Extra Allowances to
Officers in Cuba Satisfies
the President.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â A meeting or
the Cabinet was held to-day, the Presi
dent having returned from New York for
that and other business. The Porto Rlcan
civil government occupied mast of the two
hours of the meeting. The President, with
the aid of his Cabinet ollfcers, Is trying
to secure men of prominence for the posts
In the Island. If the bill pending In Con
gress to allow army officers to continue
their positions Is passed the President will
be in no haste about appointments, but if
this bill threatens to hang lire he will
have to make the appointments by May 1.
At least two of the appointments are to
be made now. These are the Treasurer
and Auditor. Secretaries Gage and Root
have, it la said, decided upon men for
these positions. A native Porto Rican is
to be nominated as Treasurer, while an
American who has been serving in the
island is to be made Auditor. He is un
derstood to be an attache of the treasury
who has demonstrated ability and clever
ness in his work in the island.
The President has made a careful can
vass of the Americans living In the
Island, with a view of considering the wis
dom of appointing a number of them to
places. Attorney General Griggs is en
deavoring to Hnd for th<* President some
prominent lawyers in this country who
will accept the judicial places under the
new bill. The salaries are so small that
few lawyers of note can be found to con
sider the positions.
The effort to collect from Turkey the
claims of the United States was .brought
up by Secretary Hay, who told of the ne
gotiations up to this time. His statement
made the Cabinet hopeful that a settle
ment can be secured at an early date, al
though the members realize it is a hard
problem to solve. -
Another milter briefly* discussed was
that of additional pay allowed a few army
officers in Cuba. Attorney General Griggs
had been asked if any law had been vio
lated. He reported to the Cabinet that
there was no violation of law and that the
action taken was warranted. ,
Secretary Root then told the Cabinet the
facts in the case. He said that soon after
General Brooke was made Governor Gen
eral of the Island he wrote to the "War
Department asking to be relieved, say
ing that he could not maintain a family
In the United States and run an expensive
establishment In Havana on the salary
and allowance he received from the Gov
ernment. He declared that he would be
come bankrupt. He referred to the great
amount of entertaining he was forced to
do and to the fact that the people of the
island expected this. The War Depart
ment official?, after serious consideration,
decided to allow General Brooke an addi
tional allowance from the Cuban funds.
The same decision was arrived at In the
case of General Ludlow, Colonel Bliss and
one or two others.
The Cabinet members say that the ex
planation of Secretary Root was satisfac
tory to the President.

Makes Public a Letter Written
by the Old Soldier.
MONTGOMERY. Ala.. April 23.-Gover
nor Johnston to-day made public a letter
written by General Joe Wheeler on the

tion as Alabama's Representative In Con

vened had worked a forfeiture of his seat.

elected.

BOERS CHECK
RELIEF FORCE
Continued from First PaKe
day and night at Jammersburg Drift. The
English entranchments have been so full
of rain that the men have been obliged
every now and theii to clamber to the
banks, only to be shot down. The Boers'
were so drenched on Saturday that they
were unable to sleep, so they started a
debate on the subject of the good to be
derived from virtue and courage. The
discussion lasted most of the night, sheila
at intervals interrupting the speakers.
Robertson Towermill is reported to have
been captured on April 21. and it is said
that the Cape Mounted Rifles have lost
during the siege 120 out of 500 men. The
British prisons rs defy the burghers to cap
ture Colonel Dalgety's camp, even if the
British are not reinforced. A surprising
number of relatives arc fighting on oppo
site sides at Wepener.

BRITISH CAPTURE
OF PAARDE KRAAL
BLOEMFONTEIN, April 23.â Colonel Al
derson's corps of mounted infantry, con
si.-ting of the First Battalions of the First
and Second Canadian Regiments and
Strathcona Horf-e. was engaged In the
operations of General Polf-Carew and
General French. Alderson had undertaken
to drive the Boers from their line of de
fense south of the water works. The
Canadians sustained a heavy fire. The
Boers shelled Alderson, who made a
marching movement around Leeuw Kop,
on the extreme left of the Boer position.
When the British battery opened fire the
Boers removed the gun. I^euw Kop was
found evacuated this morning. General
Dickson's cavalry brigade, which made a
wide detour to the left, found its further
progress barred by a strong Boer position.
LONDON. April 23.â The Bloemfontein
correspondent of the Standard, discussing
the operations at Leeuw Kop, says: "At
an early stage the cavalry came under a
heavy lire from a pompom on a ridge ad
joining Leeuw Kop. Unable to continue
its march to the southeast. General Dick
son's brigade fell back to the north to
await the infantry attack. The flanking
movement having failed. General Pole-
Carew, with General Stephenson's brigade,
advanced in crescent formation from the
south and west, with the object of en
veloping the kopjes. The Welsh, War
wickshire. Essex and Yorkshire regiments
advanced in extended line, covering the
we?t, while the Guards Brigade took up
a position to the south, with two field bat
teries and naval guns. Sheltered by the
rocks, the enemy opened a heavy lire
from the rifles and a pompom.
"Our men advanced over the open
ground in splendid style by a succession
of short rushes, falling prone while pour-
Ing in their volleys. The approach of
darkness threatened to leave .the Boers
in pos?ession, but just before sunset the
Esfex Regiment gallantly pressed forward
and drove the last man of the enemy from
Paarde Kraal, a bold spur of Leeuw
Kop."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Times says: "The British cavalry were
checked. Colonel Alderson worked partly
around the flank of Leeuw Kop. but he
was not supported. The move checked
the enemy, but fear of nightfall precluded
the possibility of a mate."
BOERS GIVE WAY
AT BUSHMAN'S KOP
MASERU. April 23.â Fighting began
early this morning at Bushmans Kop. The
colonial division under General Brabant
advanced, cautiously followed and sup
ported by General Hart's infantry brigade.
It was found that the Boers had evacu
ated their position on Bushmans Kop dur
ing the night.
A running fight has been proceeding
throughout the day, the British gradually
advancing and the Boers losing ground.
General Brabant Is moving In a north
easterly direction, keeping Basutoland
close on his right flank. Thousands of
Basutos are watching the operations. Our
casualties so far are twenty-five wounded.
The British are bivouacking to-night, ac
cording to the lates-t report, eight miles
from Wepener, and the Boers who are
besieging Colonel Dalgety appear to be
preparing to retire.
A stubborn fight is believed to have oc
curred in the direction of Dewetsdorp.
where the Boers are in strong, force with
a lot of guns, and where also there is a
relief column, apparently General Run
die's. Wepener, however, is already prac
tically relieved by the withdrawal of a
large portion of the besiegers.
PORTUGUESE PRESS
SCORES GOVERNMENT
LISBON. April 23.â The press continues
to criticize the Government's acquiescence
in the transport of British troops across
Portuguese East African territory to
Rhodesia. The Commercio affirms that
the Government has thereby violated par
agraph nine of the constitution, and
maintains that if Great Britain's right to
transport across Portuguese territory is
admitted, her right to establfsh an arsenal
at the mouth of the Tagus might be
equally recognized.

WASHINGTON. April 2T,. â Senator
Chandler, from the Senate Committee on
Privileges and Elections, to-day submit
ted to the Senate the report of lhat com
mittee in the case of Senator Clark of
Monwir.a. The report Is comparatively
brief, covering only about fifteen pages
of printed matter. It does not rehearse
the testimony, but simply presents the
firming: of the committee aÂ«d its reasons
for its course. The finding of the com
mittee i* stated as follows:
The fir.uiriE of the committee is that the elec
tion to i>\e Senate of William A. Clark of Mon
tana is null and void on amount of briberies,
attempted brib-rles and corrupt practices by
his ajents. and Â«'f violation of the laws of
Mcr.tans defining and punishing crimes against
Ihe elective franchise.
In view of this Jindlngr the committee
report! and unanimously recommends th<>
adoption l>y the Senate of the following:
resolution:
Resolved, That William A. Clark was not
Â«Ju!y end lcpaliy elected to a seat in the t=en
rie of :r.<= l.'nlted States by the Legislature of
the ttate of Montana.
Thf committee states that its finding: is
made la vi.-w of certain admittÂ»-.l <>r uu
Â«! .<rut':-d ( tacts, with their attendant cir
cumftanrcs. appearing In the testimony
taken by th<- committee, and these are
enumerated under nfteen headings, as fol
lows:
1. The expenditures in the contest of 1S1Â»5. as
testified lv Vy Senator Clark and Governor
Hauser.
2 Quotas the law of ISPr, relative to crimes
atain^t the flevtive franchise, which limited
in j-un>o*e and amount ihe political expendi
tures which could be made in any election.
Hther by tiolitical committee or a candidate,
especially naming a candidate for United States
Senator, who cou'.d not give more than JlOOO to

In connection with the consideration of four

si<SÂ«. that the whole committee finds that if

of Madison were !aid a^ide. there would utill
remain sufficient evidence in the rate to lead
ihe committee to find, as they do. that Mr.
<nark"F election i* void. From the briberies
which have been erfablished the majority of
the committee feels justified in finding that
there were other successes in procuring by cor
rupt practices the votes of member? of the
Legislature, where the facts cannot be directly
proved.
Of the conduct of the Republican tiiem-
Vvers of the J^gislature who voted for Mr.
Clark the committee says:
The conduct of the Republican members of
th*> Legislature who. on the 2Sth of January,
left their Republi'-an candidate and voted for
penator Clark and rave him his ejection, in
the opinion c.f the majority of the committee,
tails for sj-ecia! criticism. There was an abso
lute deadlock snd no possibility of the election
cf a Democrat without the aid of the Repub
licans. It is difficult to account for these Re
publican votes for Senator Clark. Senator
Clark's candidacy had been tainted on the 10th
of January by the Whiteside exposure.
The majority of the committee express
for Mr. Clark s=<^m to be pretenses and cov
â¢r*. Mr. Clark, who had been negotiating with
Mr. Hobenn. the I*s->r of the Republican*.
Â»rot 4Â» a letter on the 16th of January, in whirh
he declared himvlt to b? in tmxat of a tariff on
Montana product*. Some of thÂ» Republicans
*a!d thÂ»r* ought not lo b* a deadlock, and that
it would be brtter to hayÂ» a Democratic Sena
tor tnr.n a vacancy.
So orw pretend* that any effort Â»>Â« made. to
bring about thf election or any other Democrat
than Mr. dark, against wnose agents the
charge of bribery have Iwn made. The com
mittee do not Fay that the votes of all the
Hevea Republican* were improperly secured,

ESLABE DIES
WITH A SMILE
ON HIS LIPS
Murderer of Charles Gates
Pays the Penalty of
His Crime.
Wife and Child Disowned Him After
.Sentence and His Body Will
Be Buried in the Prison
Yard.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SAX QUENTIN PRISON. April 23.â The
crowd of morbid sensation-seekers who
made San Quentln their mecca this morn
ing were disappointed of the scene they
hoped for. Joaquln Eslabe died on the
scaffold with a smile on his face and a
cigarette between his lips. The Oakland
murderer shot through the trap at 10:31
a. m.. Hangman Frank Arbogast being his
executioner. Life was pronounced ex
tinct In nine and a half minutes by Dr.
Casey, the prison physician.
Eslabe frequently vowed he would cheat
the gallows and his general demeanor was
that of a man who would create a scene
on the scaffold, hence the crowd was one
of the largest ever witnessed here at an
execution. \.
At a few minutes after 10 o'clock/ War
den Aguirre entered the death chamber
accompanied by the death watch, Guards
Mueller and Begley. The two priests.
Father Vallentine of Sausalito and Sulli
van of San Rafael, then left Eslabe's stee
to walk with the Warden in Tront of the
condemned man, guarded on either side
on his last walk from the death cell to the
gallows. As the Warden addressed him
Eslabe smiled pleasantly, and rolled and
lit a cigarette with a hand ,as firm as
though he were going to freedom. He
then professed himself prepared and the
procession started. A few seconds later
the trap fell. Eslabe having spoken no
word nor shown trace of fear. The drop
was 5 feet 8 inches.
The execution was chiefly remarkable
for not having: been performed on Friday,
being the second to bÂ«* held outside that
day within the walls, the other exception
âMiller the hunchbackâ having met death
on a Wednesday. '
The crime for which Eslabe paid his life
was the murder of Charles E. Gates, a
tamale vender in Oakland, on the night of
March 27, IS9S. Gates, a cripple, was tied
to his chair by Eslabe. and after the Mex
ican had robbed his victim of a $25 watch
and $1 75 he beat the cripple's skull to a
jelly with a piece of paspipe. Gates had
on several occasions befriended Eslabe,
and tho latter owed him a small sum.
Eslabe blamed his lawyers for the sen
tence of death pronounced on him by
Judge Opden of. Oakland. The murderer's
wife and child disclaimed him after the
death sentence and he died to-day alone
and friendless. His body will be buried
in the prison cemetery.

F;>wia! Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.CHAPLAIN DAVID H. SHIELDS.
PHILADELPHIA, April 23.â David
Haddington Shields, a post chaplain in
the United States army, died suddenly to
day in the Pennsylvania Hospital. The
Coroner has ordered a post mortem ex
amination to determine the cause of
death.
Shields, Â¦who Is supposed to be about 47
years of age, went to a hotel this morn
ing ostensibly to take a Turkish bath.
While there he was taken suddenly ill
and an ambulance was called, which took
the sick man to the hospital, where he
died.
A letter to the Coroner from Dr. John
I. McKelwey states that death was prob
ably due to pneumonia and alcoholism,
with a history of an alleged injury to the
head.
The 6ad story of Rev. Mr. Shields' down
fall, which has culminated In his death, is
well known to the citizens of San Fran
cisco.
The unfortunate minister was appointed
a chaplain in the army two years ago.
He was stationed at Alcatraz when
charges were filed against him of conduct
prejudicial to the good order and disci
pline of the army. It was shown at the
trial that he had been Intoxicated on sev
eral occasions in the presence of enlisted
men and civilians and he was found
guilty. The findings of the court-martial
were approved by the Washington author
ities and the chaplain was dismissed from
the army on February 1. Shortly there
after he was found unconscious on the
water front, suffering from want and ex
posure as much as from the effects of
alcoholism. He was treated at the City
Receiving Hospital, when Mrs. Dr. d'An
cona. the wife of the Supervisor, became
interested In his case. She made arrange
ments whereby. the ex-chaplain was sent
to his family in Fort Wayne, Ind. What
became of Rev. Mr. Shields from the time
he was started homeward from this city
was unknown until the news of his sud
den death In Philadelphia was received In
the above dispatch.

WHISKY SAVED
MANY PERSONS
FROM DROWNING
Why the Attempt to Blow Up
Welland Canal Lock
Failed.
Conspirators Discovered Through
Their Too-Free Indulgence
in a Tonic for the
Uerves.
NIAGARA FALLS. N. V., April 23.â 1f
Karl Dullxnan, John Nolln (not Nolan, as
k was first reported) and John Walsh, the
dynamiters who last Saturday morning
tried to blow cut a lock on the Welland
canal at Thorold, had not been so free In
their use of whisky the chances are that
a good many of the people of the village
of llcrriton and the country round-about
Â¦would have been drowned. The men did
their planning when they were sober, but
when the time came for their last and
most dangerous move they were drunk.
As a result they did their work carelessly
and used topers' judgment in their selec
tion of a time to put their plans Into ex
ecution. They lowered the dynamite into
the lock at 7:30 o'clock in the evening,
â¢whm they could be plainly seen from a
distance. Had they waited until midnight
and cone to the scene sober they would
no doubt have blown out the lock. Per
sons familiar with the region say that had
the lock at Thorold been opened the rush
of water from the surface level above
would have swept the town of Merriton
out of existence, destroyed a section of
Thorold and devastated a vast area.
Thp Canadian authorities are at present
as much in the dark as to the motive of
the dyruvrohers as they were on Sunday.
They "are a!.Â«o without positive knowledge
of the identity of the prisoners. Three
theories have bt-en advancedâ that the
m*-n were hired by lioer sympathizers,
that FfnSans instigated it and that the
men were hired to do the job by enemies
of thÂ« Connor syndicate, hoping the de
struction cf the Canadian waterway would
prevent for this Reason the passage of any
cram through Montreal. The latter the
ory found support as it was suggested,
and to-Cay every one along the Canadian
bor<J<-r. the dr-tÂ«--ctives and other officers
included, expressed their belief in this so
lution.
Prfposterous as It pounds, still, the of
ficers said, it was a shade less ridiculous
than the other theories. Referring to the
cause to-day. Chief Ycung of this place
jaid:
"Thorp is not tho slightest doubt in my
mind that the ir.^n were tools for some
body of m^n. Thf force behind It all may
not bÂ« learned, but if it is I feel satisfied
that there will bo a sensation which will
cause talk for a long time." .

In which he thanked the people of the
town and expressed the appreciation of
the delegates.
Politics in this session will be confined
almost entirely fb the election of grand
officers. There is not one item of busi
ness which more than another is food for
discussion among the delegates or a topic
for curbstone conversation. There Is not
even a prospect of Interest over the place
for the next session â In fact, where the
next session will go Is a mystery, for no
town has bid for it but Sonora, and So
nora is believed to be out of the question,
because of her lack of facilities and the
difficulties of getting there. Such a con
dition of affairs Is somewhat of a novelty
at the Grand Parlor.

BOISE, Idaho. April 23.â United States
Marshal Ramsey to-day, near Weiser, se
cured a complete counterfeiting outfit
with the exception of the molds. The
outfit was cached in the willows along
the creek and was discovered by the

had evidently been thrown from the train.
These molds were found near the place

OFFICERS FOR LEAGUE
OF REPUBLICAN CLUBS
Many Names Have Already Been
Mentioned, and a Lively Con
test Is Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call. !
LOS ANGELES, April 23.â From pres
ent Indications before the biennial con
vention of the League of Republican
Clubs convenes, Friday, April 27, much in
terest will have been aroused in the selec
tion of a president and secretary of the
State League for the ensuing term.
It is now known that Colonel George
Stone, the present president, does not
again wish the honor. While the Los An
geles contingent has no special candidate
the names of General W. H. L. Barnes,
George A. Knight and George C. Pardee
are locally mentioned. The candidate that
has the greatest following and who is be
ing groomed by the Republican League of
San Francisco is their popular member,
G. A. Newhall. His candidacy, as far as
Los Angeles Is concerned, may receive
much consideration. The honor of secre
tary may fall to Al Llnley. who Is backed
by a number of Northern delegations. One
of the undeveloped struggles will be the
selection of the thirty-four delegates to
represent the State League In the Na
tional League Convention that meets in
St. Paul, July 17 and 19. Each district will
be allowed four delegates, with six dele
gates at large.
The younger blood of the league Is de
termined that only workers and active
men shaTl fill any position within the gift
of the convention. All is in readiness for
the reception of the delegates. The exec
utive committee reports to-night that 1350
delegates have been chosen from the 255
clubs that have reported. The official
count of members in the State as reported
by the club officers now reaches 26,000. A
score of clubs will report during this
week. San Jose will send 200 delegates
and workers, as that town Is In the fight
for convention honors, and from the looks
of things the plum will go there. A still
hunt is being made by two other towns.
SAMPSON DECLARES HE
STILL RANKS SCHLEY
Says the Published Report of His
Rival's Victory Is News
to Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 23.â The news of Ad
miral Schley's alleged victory was given
to Admiral Sampson by The Call corre
spondent to-day. He said:
"Most of this Is entirely new to me. I
never heard of it before. A representa
tive of a New York paper did call a few
days ago with a brief, condensed account
of these 'exposures' of Mr. Crowninshield
and myself. I simply told him there was
nothing for me to say; that these things
were settled long ago.
"What I wish somebody would explain
to me is thisâ l see It repeated constantly
In this clipping. What is meant when it
says. 'Schley ranks Sampson'?" â¢, .
"Then he does not?" was asked.
"Why, I hope not." exclaimed the ad
miral, in a tone which left no doubt of his
view upon the point. Â¦
"Do you believe that the supplement
and the alternative referred to were put
before the President as Btated?"
"Possibly; I cannot say. I have seen
the President several times lately. Not
very lately, though; not that I would nec
essarily have referred to it. I am not
aware that I am a party to any feud."
"Then you do not regard this reported
attack upon you as being detrimental to
your standing and prospects in the ser
vice?" . â¢: T
"No, I do not.'
"And you do not believe that President
McKinley's friendship and support have
been in any measure lessened or impaired
by the incident?" :
"No, I certainly do not," responded the
admiral. Â¦

"delegates to the Grand Parlor of the Na-
the trials and adventures of the Dormer
partyâ L. A. Garthle and J. C. Hoop.
The annual reports of the grand officers
were distributed to the delegates during
the morning session.
Delegates Entertained.
This concluded the business of the day f s
session and the remainder of the hours of
Eunlight were for the delegates to enjoy
themselves. The committee had carriaue
room for all who wished to ride and soon
the surrounding roads were full of gay
parties, some headed north on the road
to Thermalito and Cherokee, others south
to down the river where the dredgers are
mining.
"Dredger mining" is an industry pe
culiar to this section and there was
enough about it to interest the delegates
until supper time. Then after that there
was the reception to the delegates in
Union Opera Hall and the turning over to
them of a deed to the city. It was a great
occasion. Uhe grand officers were grouped
on the stage with the chairmen of the
town committees and the town officials.
Major A. F. Jones was spokesman for the
town, and in the following words hÂ« bads
the delegates welcome and delivered to
them full possession of Oroville and the
hearts of all Its people.

a committee on credentials had

rose to announce the death of Grand
Trustee Frank Sabichi of Los Angeles,

Death of C. J. Belloli.
SAX JOSE. April 23.â Clement J. Bel
loll, a prominent and popular young busi
ness man of this city, died to-day a3 the
result of an operation for appendicitis,
which was performed yesterday. He had
been 111 but four days. Deceased was a
Native Son and had been olected as a
delegate to the Grand Parlor at Orovllle.
He was 26 years of age.

of expense and because the Regents them
selves would probably establish the chair
if the Native Sons should present the mat
ter to them in the proper light, so it will
go to some committeeâ that is, of course,
unless something happens.
Candidates for Office.
As for grand officers, while the fight Is
not openly fierce, still friends are â¢working
very hard for friends. Frank Mattlson,
grand president, will become "past"; R.
C. Rust, the first vice president, will take
his place, and Frank L. Coombs and
Lewis F. Byington, second vice president
and grand orator, will follow the time
honored custom and each go up a notch.
H. Kahn of Hesperian No. 137 is not be
lieved to hay much chance against Henry
Martin for treasurer, but Martin's friends
are not Idle.
The fight for grand orator Is gTowlng
more complicated. It Is beginning to look
like McNoble of Stockton, and In this con
nection the story Is current that Cutler,
seeing this, would withdraw If he saw a
chance of being elected once more as a
grand trustee. Some years ago. in the
fight between R. C. Rust and Prank LÂ».
Coombs for the same place, Coombs with
drew under promise of re-election as
grand trustee and then to be made grand
orator the year after. This programme
was carried out and now it is under
stood that Cutler would like a repetition of
the plan. The adherents of the candidates
for grand trustee declare they will not
stand for It. however. They say their
fights have all been organized and Cutler
cannot, after making a strong tight for
grand orator. Inject himself Into any
other. The situation Is Interesting.
For grand outside sentinel there are

Captive Galloped In Ahead
of Scotch Plaid and
V 1 11 U 1 o.
Captive disposed of a field in the mile
selling event at Oakland yesterday in
much the same way as he did some three
years ago, when the big chestnut was
one of the talked about horses of' the
turf. He warmed up so full of ginger
that it attracted for him many friends In
the betting. Scotch Plaid ruled a 6 to 5
favorite for the race and was beaten in
a gallep, with Horton pressing the first
choice hard for place honors.
The Burns & waterhouse horse was not
the only short priced one to be numbered
among the fnllen, for Poorlands, Diderot.
Slrver Tone and Storm King all went by
the board.
A mild PÂ»nsatlon was created by the ln
trdductory overture, when Melkarth, a 20
to 1 shot, got to the wire a neck ahead of
Inverary. Poorlanda, the favorite, crack
ed pome Ice out in front for a while, when
he melted away, finishing among the "also
rans."
Miss Madeline, with Ames up, was
ehoson to lead the parade In the flve
furlong dAsh following. At odds of S to 5,
she landed the purse ridden out from Net
tle Clark. For Freedom and seven others.
Quite the best betting race of the day
was the two-year-old sprint, for which
Rollick and Diderot were both quoted at
3 to a in the first prices marked up. I/ater
Diderot was backed down to even money
favoritism. Shields, astride the first nam
ed youngster, was quickest away at the
start and. never headed, disposed of the
favorite by a length. Showing a return
of form, Moonbrignt ran a good third.
Again ex-Jockey George Miller's Sir
Hampton demonstrated he could negoti
ate a route with light weight up. The
brown colt was held a 6 to 1 chance for
the mile and a sixteenth run and, after
leading from the start, passed the judges
a n*ck before Ailenna. Buchanan mad*
very poor work of It on the 9 to 10 fa
vorite. Silver Tone, for which he was
taken to task by the stand. I - .
The afterpiece went to Perseus, second
choice In the ring. Driving hard, Donator
led Tlradt over tne mark fpr place honors.
Storm King, the first choice, could prob
ably have won with any sort of hand
ling.

DEBUTE OPENS
ON THE CASE OF
SENATOR QUAY
This Afternoon at 4 O'clock
the Question- Will Be
Disposed Of.
Chandler of Ntw Hampshire Is the
Applicant's Most Sturdy Cham
pion and Urgpes That He
Be Seated.
WASHINGTON. April 3.-A two days'
debate on the right of the H<m>. M. B.
Quay to a seat as B Senafnr from Penn
sylvania w.is begun alm<*-t hnmedlntfiy
aft*Â»r the Senate convened to-day. Until
to-day the debate has been desultory in
character. To-morrow at 4 p. m.. under
a rpecial order, the case Is to be disposed
cf. A direct vote upon the proposition to
scat Quay may not b<? taken immediately
after the close of the debate. Chandler
hfip a motion jwmlin-j to Pf\it Quay, but
It is hÂ«Md by the Senate parliamentarians
that trvmry cubfidiary motion will takt*
precedence over Chandler's motion. The** 1
include motions to indefinitely postpone;
to postpone to a definite ii.\t": 10 rctiodtmit
to the committee, and to nnnnd. How the
Senate will vote on them is a manor of
*r>ecuiatiiin.
' In purport of Quay's right to a peat
?}ieechf>g were delivered to-day by Chan
dler of NÂ«w Hatni>shire. Kenm y "f Dela
ware and Penrosf Â«l Pennsylvania. Platt
of Connecticut and Queries of Wisconsin
delivered speeches in opposition to QuÂ«.v.
Chandler urged the Senators to consider
the question merely as .â¢â¢lie of <on.;tltu
ticnal cnnfitructioM. Adverting to the
Mantle case in I^3 am) lh<* t orbett case
in thÂ« last Cunprt'Ss. he said they were
not fair precedents' upon which to base
ectlon.
"I know Senators." sai.l he "anil I am
nr.t filing to mention names, who voted
against Mantle b*rauÂ«<? l:Â«" Â«raa what w.i.~
called a silver Ponator; an<l I knÂ«w that
ffmf Serratot?â p^rhnps in B spirit of rr
taliationâvnted acairst Corbetl because
hr v.af what was called a goid Senator."
I""Iatt of Â«'onnÂ« > ctlcut. replying to ("han
dler, Â«aid that in his rypininn th*^ one ques
tion thnt Uea in the forefront of this <liÂ«=
curflotj was "whether anything can be
considered as settled in the Pennte of the
I'nited fitates. Is the Senate, now la the
one hundred anÂ«l twelfth fear of its f\
iMenee, to observe the alni'>Â«t unbroken
lln* cf precedents: nr is it to he gov
erned by political and personal friend-
Fhips?"
"I Â«m Borry." cr.ntinuo*! Platt. "that
Â»ny Ser.Jif.r should m^ke a charee
against Pixtron P^natnrs tha.t they voted
apainst a Senator becaus* of personal
rrasons and not on ckMMtltUtlonAj grounds.
That charge is one whi<^ rÂ«~?.rcts greater
up^n thr Senate than any that
has over bern msdf.
"I do not believe it. No enemy of the
Senate could say. iÂ» seerr." to me. that
the votes of sixteen Senators xvf>r<Â» caÂ«t
agninst Mr. CThett because he waiÂ« a rÂ«!p
porter of the gold standard."
Flatt maintainoil there wns pra<~ticallr
no differ^nre between the Quay <-*se an'l
the Corbett caÂ«e and that the <*>ciÂ«ion m
the Corbett c.i?e ought to bo r^garf ?A ac
pacred as was the judgment of a constitu
tional court.
Hoar, interrupting, said that when Sen
at'irs belle^-ed a .VriÂ«irn in n ca*Â» had
been reached in violation of cor.ntitntinn
al right and that th<Â» Penate h;Â»d been in
fluenced by personal nnd po'ltical con-
Bidoratlons. hup he believed waÂ« true of
the Cnrbett caÂ«e. It was their bounden
duty to reverse that d^ololnn.
Platt. In reply, asked if Hoar thought
the Penate more virtuous now than when
It decided the Corbet t case.
"Th" Penate is on trial at the bar of
public opinion." pnld Platt. in conclusion.
"This case is known throughout the
length and breadth of the lnnd. It is
known that this case resembles that of
Mr. Cnrbett of two years o*ro. If Mr:
Quay is seated the people nill want to
know why vhe Senate ch.insred front. They
v ill henr that It hnp I^en said on the
floor of this chamber that the Senators
voted apafnst Mr. Corbet t l>Â«eause of cer
tain political considtTatlons rather than
on constitutional groundf. This Is' why r
Implore Senators to *tand by former de
cisions of the Sf>nat<Â». why I appeal to
them to stand by a long line of settle^
actions. Onc<Â» the precedents are over
turned seats in this body will become the
rport of political exigency."
Kenney of Delaware then addressed the
Senate In Fwpport of Quay'r rljcht to a
peat. HÂ«Â» voted against the pouting of
<^orbett two yrars airo. but held that the
and Quay rapp? differed radicaliv.
ITÂ»Â» added that certain charges were mÂ«dÂ«Â»
ncainst Corb^tt and ndmitt^d frankly that
th*Â» charges had more weieht in Influenc

forts to keeping on edge. Up is under
weight and has no worries on that score.
He is as confident thot he will defeat the
Californian as he is of being alive on the
day of the fight. Â¦ Â»
When asked yesterday whether he would
enter the roped arena with his mustache
intact, he fondly stroked the hirsute
appendage and renlfed that he had worn
It in every battle lie had engaged in, and
that he did not fear It would be knocked
off or that its rurllng ends would droop
in defeat. Murphy is undoubtedly in
splendid condition. There is not an ounce
of superfluous flesh on his sturdy frame.
His Wind is also good In spite of his heavy
breathing. A number of admirers who
watched him at work in his quarters at
the Casino yesterday were loud in their
expressions of deliKht at his exhibition of
clever foot work, hitting' powers and en
durance. He practically completed his
heavy work yesterday, and during the
next three days will indulge only in light
exercise. Dan Rodgera, his trainer, has
put forth his best efforts- to have Murphy
in shape for a hard battle, and he has
succeeilrÂ«l.
Neill positively asserts that he was
never in finer trim for a fight than he is
for his coming bout with the Australian.
He does not underrate his opponent, and
has undergone a course of training under
the eyes of "Duck" Sullivan and Fred
Muller, which will tit him for any kind of
a battle Murphy may Rive him. His mus
cles are supple and his "solar plexus" re
pion is protected by un armor plate cov
ering. The young Californlan Is as kit
tenish as a two-year-old. He brightens
his training quarters by his high spirits,
nnd the feeling seems infectious. His
trainers are happy in the belief that Al
will again return a winner, and both men
are already planning future contests for
the clever middle-weight.
Toby Irwin andJ2ddy Toy are trained to
the hour. Th?re Is every likelihood that
their coming battle will surpass their first
meeting for fast fighting, grit and science.
Seats are now being erected in the Me
chanics' Pavilion to accommodate 6500 peo

SANTA BARBARA. April 23.â The last

played here to-day between Riverside
and Burllngame, the latter winning easily
by a score of ten to three. The grounds
were fairly packed with people anxious to
see the two teams compete for the cham

was rendered. Hobart of Burlingam*
clearly demonstrated the fact that he was
by far the best player In any of the- clnbs
yet Maud of Riverside cams In for his
share of admiration from the spectator*
The peopl* of this city have only Just
begun to appreciate this sport and in the
fnture the grame will be quite popular
here. Already there is talk of organizing
a club, besides the one now here, for the
purpose of more practice In the future
To-morrow there will be some very ln
terestlm? races, only the polo ponies be

visitors occur every evening.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 1900.
DR. SHEARER
FLATLY DENIES
ALL CHARGES
Says There Is a Scheme' on
Fcoi/ to Have Him
Dismissed.
He Further States That the Ladies
Who Make Complaints Did Not
Resign, but Were Dis
charged.
Social IXsratch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. April Â».-A great deal of
comment has been occasioned by the sen
sational allegations contained in to-day's
Call repardlnj? the conditions paid to have
existed a few months ajro at the County
Hospital.
Dr. M. M. Shearer, the superintendent,"
apainst whom Mlfs poehlmnnn makes her
charpes. Is the oldest practicing physician
In this city and one of the best known
men in the entire county. With the late.
Dr. J. F". Boyce he numbered at one time
almost all the leading families of this part
<>f the bounty In his clientele and still en-
Joys a large and highly remunerative
private practice In addition to position
us superintendent of the County Hospital
nn<] farm.
F<r the past week the doctor has been in
Trinity County, where he has minlne in
terests. He returneil from there Sunuuy
and when interviewed to-day upon Uie
FUbJeci of Miss I'oehlinatiii's charges he
expressed himrelf as beinpr very much
FUipris-erJ Indeed at the turn affairs ha<l
taken Ouriifg his absence. HÂ« deaied the
enargos in toto and said the allegations of
both Mis.- Poehlmann and Miss Sunriell
were false fr'>m beginning â¢â¢> end. It will
be remembered that ii their affidavits
both the women In question stated that
they le.-ianed their positions on account
of tho treatment accorded them by the
venerable superintendent "of the institu
tion in which they were employed.
This the doctor denies. He states that
they were dismissed. If this statement is
correct it perhaps explains one of Miss
Pdehlmaxins statements regarding- an In
cident connected with her leavina; the
horpital. She claims that just before her
ilrpfirturÂ»Â» ;;he met two members of the
Board of Supervises and they expressed
sÂ«.me surprise when informed that she was
groinp. that she should have resigned, and
aim that they had not brrn notified of the
fact. Ar. superintendent of the hospital
Dr. Shearer has full authority to dis
charge or empU'v nny hHp he sees fit, and
if he discharged the matron and nurse
there tvns perhaps no particular reason
f.ir r*purt inj* the matter to the board un
less he saw fit. When asked if he intend
Â«d to resign the doctor stated most em
phatically that he did not.
'"rhere" is nothing whatever in the
Charges." he paid, "ami I intend to fight
them to th<Â» i>itter end. 1 do not care to
any anything injurious to the gooil names
'Â¦f the ladies In question, but I trust my
friTils will not forget thgt there are two
lilies to every story. As a mntter of fact
the Â¦whole thing is part of a scheme to
have me dismissed as superintendent of
the Coyntr Hospital and farm ?ind an
other local physician substituted In my
stead. For the past eljrht years I have
held the position under both Democratic
anÂ«l Republican boards, and my work
sprakr for Itself. I have saved the county
a rreat deal of money In that time and
the Institution over which I preside Is rec
ognized as a model of Its kind. I do not
believe anything wfll come of the charges
because as a matter of fact they are un
founded."
A great deal of sympathy is heard here
concerning Dr. Shearer's family. It
stands high in pocial circles and, like the
ijootor himeelf, has many friend* who will
no doubt rally to the doctor's support. On
thÂ° other Rand, many have expressed
them.=t"-lves as o/ the opinion that a
change In the management of the hospital
Is both to be desired and a necessity as
well.
Among the latter Is Supervisor Herbert
YV. Austin. Austin Is a Republican and
Shearer is a Democrat. I^ast year Austin
voted apainÂ«t the doctor when the matter
of the annual "lection of a hospital super
intendent came before thÂ« board. The
matter rill, if th<? Ministerial Union Car
rie-* It before the board, undoubtedly con
stitute the most lntererMns detail of the
May meetlns of the Supervisors, and while
Dr. Bhearer makes the assertion with a
Rreat deal of confidence that he does not
believe the board will take any action in
the matter It Is hard to Fee now it can
be avoided If the charges are formally
presented to that body by the Influences
now Interested in the case.

LriKuo 20 103REDWOOD TIMBER
SYNDICATE WILL
NOT GO THROUGH
Option on Lands and Mills
Expires the First Day
of May.
Promoters "Were Unable to Secure
Necessary Capital â New Combine
Hay Be Formed On Much
Smaller Basis.
It is stated on good authority that the
Fyndicate formed about a year ago to buy
up all the redwood timber in Northern
California and Oregon will not go through.
The option on the lands and mills will ex
pire on May 1. and It is understood that
it will not be renewed. As far as can be
learned the syndicate has never made any
effort to survey the immense tract of land
it contemplated buying and the matter
will simply be dropped.
Inability to raise the amount of coin
necessary to float the big deal is given as
the reason for the abandonment of the
schrme. On the basis' on which the pur
chase of lands and mills was planned it Is
stated that it would have taken fully J20.
000.000 to have consummated the deal. It
is claimed there is not enough demand
for redwood lumber at the present time
to warrant the Investment of so much
capital. The area of the timber lands
that were to have been taken in has
never been.detinitely known, but the prop
osition was to corner practically all the
accessible redwood timber on the coast.
There is a possibility that another syn
dicate may be formed by different parties
on new lines and on a much lower basis
than the old one. It Is understood that
one plant and section of land that were
offered to the old syndicate for nearly
$1,000,000 can now be had for JWO.OOO. "The
calculation is that the scheme can be
floated on a capital of $10,000,000 and on
that basis can be put through. Agents of
the proposed new syndicate are now
working on thÂ« plan.
The agents for the old syndicate are
Holt & Gray. It is understood that no
"cruisers" have been sent' through the
timber and practically no surveys of It
have been made. â¢
the California Theater in a farewell con
cert. These artists have made such a fav
orable impression that the attendance will
undoubtedly be greater than at the pre
vious concerts, when the public was only
learning to like them. On Friday Mr,
Petschnikoff will play the Bach Fugue,
which i 3 seldom undertaken in public, and
Mr. Hambourg and Mr. Lachaume will
play "The Danse Macabre" on two pianos.

selections. Jones, Davis and Heard, the
Criterion Trio, also present a very funny
sketch. The balance of the "WH includes
the Hewitts, Mullen and Ward, Edwari
Adams and new moving pictures.
Fischer's Concert House.
This week's programme at Fischer's
Concert House is diversified enough to
please the most . exacting music lover.
The vocal selections as rendered by Sig
nor Badaracco, Slgnorinas Barducci. Pol
lettlni and Puereri. and the songs in En
glish by Miss Sherwood, were all hear
tily encored. The opera offering, "La
Traviata," was acted and sung enjoyably.
Gentry's Dumb Actors.
The trained animal show at Central
Park Is stil! an interesting source of
amusement to the people of this city.
Every one marvels at the cleverness of
Professor Gentry's dumb equine and
canine actors. The programme is one
long comedy enacted by fourfooted play
ers. who seem to enter into the fun of the
parts they take.
Olympia.
There is a good bill at the Olympla this
week. Romalo Brothers and the Bartons
continue to be popular and the rest of the
programme was well received last night.
California.
"Captain Lettarblair" drew another
crowded house at the California last even
ing. The play bids fair to be banner week
of the Neill season.
Grand Opera-House.
The extravaganza at the Grand Opera
house, with its wealth of pretty girfs and
gorgeous scenery, continues to attract the
theater-going public. The company has
"caught on" and the indications are that
the "Arabian Girl" is on for a long run.
A rehearsal of the musical and physical
culture features of the teachers' May day
festival, to be held at Glen Park, took
place in . the Lincoln Schoolhouse yard
yesterday. Hundreds of pupils partic'
pated. Professor Itarth. director of physi
cal culture, and Miss Estelle Carpenter,

McPartland of New York and Dal Hawk
ins of California were billed to box twen

refused to go on, as McPartland was over
weight. The club managers then put on
Jerry Sullivan of Boston in place of Mc-
Partland. Sullivan was shorter but sev
eral pounds heavier than the Californian.
When the men were introduced the crowd
hooted, as they saw it was to be an un
even battle. Sullivan made a rush in the
second, landing right and left on Hawkins,
but it was only spasmodic, as Hawkins
floored him with a right swing on the
jaw.
When the Bostonlan got up again he
was bewildered, and Hawkins forced him
all over iho ring, landing both hands on
body and head â¢nt will. Sullivan fell
agnlnst the ropes and would have gone
down and out had not the referee stopped
the bout before the three minutes had ex
pired. White led Sullivan to his corner

Promotions in Police Department.

for promotions in the Police Department,
in compliance with a request made by the
Board of Police Commissioners. The lat
ter were under the impression that the

the service. The Civil Service Commission
holds that under th* charter the depart
ment may have but five captains, that is
one for every 303 patrolmen. Th<Â»rÂ«* arp 505
officers. As Captain Sej mour has been

that a vacancy existed. The Civil Service
Commission finds that there are only three

manner in which promotion? wili be made
was postponed tor three weeks.
SIR KNIGHTS
WELCOMED IN
LOS ANGELES
Commanderies in Attendance
at the Annual Con
clave.
City Is En Fete, and the Street
Parade Will Ba the Principal
Feature of Interest to the
Public.
LOS ANGELES. April 23.â Los Angeles
will be en fete during three days of the
present week, the Knights Templar of
California having already begun to take
possession of the city as Its guests.
The forty-second annual State conclave
was ushered in with the arrival of Cali
fornia Commandery of San Francisco and
Oakland Commandery shortly after 11
o'clock this morning. The two command
erics, with a representation from Peta
luma. reached here in a special train. The
San Francisco Commandery brought with
it fifty black horses for the use of its
members, and a white one for Eminent Sir
Knight John Tonnlngsen. commander.
The visitors were met at the Arcade
depot by a band, several Knights in full
uniform from Los Angeles turning out to
greet them and escorting them to their
hotels. The Oakland men were first de
posited at the Hotel Van Nuys, the San
Francisco Commandery being taken to
the Hollinbeck.

new and different. The rest of the com
pany is not obtrusive, except in the pro
gramme which contains the names of
some thirty dramatis personae, most of
whom constitute the scenery.
Lucy Daly is spindly and spritely and
dances with her same old enthusiasm, and
also sing?. There are others, too. who
sing, "assisted by the chorus." but the as
sistance is vain and vile and of the buzz-
Eaw variety. Will West and Margaret
Daly Yokes are unconsciously humorous
In their rendering of a familiar ditty, to
whirh the male gives a fantastic phrastic
rendering. He insists upon telling "ted
honey" that he has "whey," and gets an
encore for doing so.
Kncores were scarce last night and were
generally born in the gallery and "as
sisted by the chorus" in the lobby. A cer
tain George Sidney made most of what
laughter there was in the part of Isy
Mafk, a vehicle for many of the hand
me-down jokes I have mentioned. His
greatest bi^ for applause was when he
acquires an earful of beer from a speak
ing tube, one of the daintiest episodes in
a generally vulgar performance.
PORTER GARNETT.
Orpheum.
The Orpheum's programme- this week
contains the names of many how artists,
although those who appeared last week
were welcomed and liberally applauded.
Miss Gussie Brosche, who appeared with
Frank Rae in a light skit, showed much
cleverness in her performance . on the
piano. Among the new and beautiful
faces is that of Miss Mildred Stoller. who
is possessed of a pleasing voice. One of
the most highly appreciated entertainers
is Dlgby Bell. His stories and songs kept
the audience in a roar of laughter. He
was regarded as a whole show in himself.
Falke and Semon. musical comedians,
were cordially. received. Among the dan
cers Mile. Proto can be rated as decidedly
clever. Another feature of the show is
Mile. Marzella's performing birds. The
efforts of Bellman and Moore to please
were successful. A. O. Duncan, the ven
triloquist, contributed his share of amuse
ment. The last on the progranfme, but by
no means the least, were the Guitanos,
acrobats. They were excellent and the
entire audience remained quiet until the
curtain went down.
Tivoli.
"The Wizard of the Nile" entered upon
its second week in better shape than ever.
Ferris Hartman is still funnier and inde
fatigable in his efforts to keep the busi
ness, going without any lapses. He was
ably assisted by Wheelan. Annie Meyers.
Frances Graham and Helen Merrill. Miss
Merrill as the Princess was In unusual
good voice last night and her acting was
of the dainty order required by the part.
As a result of the efforts of the company
the house enjoyed a hearty laugh from the
rise to the fall of each curtain. The en
semble of the choruses was specially
praiseworthy, the wreath ballot being par
ticularly charming, while the choral sing
ing left little to be desired. .The Tivoli
management has In preparation "The
Three Musketeers." "Madeline, or the
Magic Kiss" and "The Sea King." each
of which promises to afford a rich fund of
amusement.
Alcazar.
Sinklewicz's "Quo Vadis," with its many
picturesque and strong situations, its flow
ing action, its turgid heroics and its caric
ature of a tyrant, holds its own in the
public heart with a sure grip. There was
not a seat vacant in the Alcazar last night
and the audience applauded a good deal
at. the heroic sayings of the stage Chris
tians, and sniveled just a little bit In the
melancholy passages. "Quo â¢Vadis". Is an
object lesson of the fact that melodrama
Is one of the amiable weaknesses of

SKULL CRUSHED BY
A MOVING ELEVATOR
A Japanese Boy Meets With a Hor
rible Death in a Lodging-
House.
A Japanese boy who was known as
George Tattusokto met with a horrible
death in a lodging-houne at 31 Stockton
street last night. He was in the freight
compartment of the elevator when he sig
naled the conductor to ascend to the next
floor. Just before the elevator started the
unfortunate boy jumped from the cage to
pick tip some article of furniture which
he had intended to take up stairs with
him. After securing it he jumped back
Into the moving cage. He was struck by
the floor of the passenger compartment
and thrown headlong into the storeroom.
When picked up it was found that his
skull was fractured at the base and his
neck broken. As he was still breathing he
was removed to the Receiving Hospital,
but died soon after reaching there.
James Walnright. the boy who was In
charge of the elevator at the time, was
arrested, but released on bonds.
SCNE OF BURK'S DEATH AND PARTICIPANTS IN TRAGEDY.
mONEY and Jealousy seem to be
important factors in the mystery
surrounding the death of Charles
Burk. who was taken from the
home of John Dempsey Sunday night
with his skull crushed and his pockets
empty. Dempsey and Martha Ball, the
woman with whom he has resided at 2u9
Natoma street, are detained at the City
Prison suspected of being responsible for
Burk's tragic end.
The police are making a thorough inves
tigation of the case. While the circum
stances point strongly toward the guilt of
Dempsey and the Ball woman the detec
tives have not yet been able to secure any
direct evidence connecting them with the
crime.
The finding of the dead man's money
and watch hidden In the basement of the
Dempsey house is one of the things the
nceuseu wiil have to explain. The state
ment of Robert Ford. Burk's roommate
at 40 Minna street, that the deceased and
Dempsey had been rivals for the affec
lions of Martha Ball and that they had
frequently quarreled over her supplies a
possible motive for the crime.
In thÂ« face of this Dempsey and his
companion proclaim their innocence. Their
ttory is that Burk fell down a stairway
and "sustained the injuries which caused
his death. They had lifted his body from
the narrow sidewalk where it lay. they as
sert, and tenderly carried it into the
house where it was found by the Morgue
officials.
Detective Dillon and Police Officer
Reamer are investigating the case. The
officer was notified of tne tragedy soon
after it had occurred. He and Pollen Offi
cer Morrissey went to the Dempsey hjuse
at once. They found the body of Burk on
the bed in an upper front room. They
elicited from Dempsey the stairway story.
It appeared plausible enough until Ford,
the dead man's roommate, made the dis
closures concerning Burk's money and
watch. He stated that Sunday evening
before Burk left to visit Dempsey he had
handed him $33 and a watch which he had
been keeping for him since the night be
fore.
Officer Beamer then drmand^d from
Dempsey to tell him where the watch and
money were. He denied that he knew
anything about the missing money or the
timepiece. The Bail woman declared that
she was similarly ignorant. Beamer in
pistM on getting* the information. The
woman finally weakened and led him
down to the basement and revealed
Burk's watch and $25 in money hidden un
i'er a lounge.- She said she had taken the
property irom the body while her hus
uand was away looking for a doctor.
"Burk and myself were always good
friends and never quarreled," said Demp
sey at the prison yesterday. "He came to
my place about S:3O Sunday night and
started to leave at a quarter of 10. He
was intoxicated. He opened the door and
my wife started after a lamp to light
him down the steps. Suddenly he fell and
went clear down to v the sidewalk. My
wife ran back and exclaimed, *My God,
Charlie lias fallen I' We both went down
and found Burk lying with his head clear
out on the cobbles. I tried to pack him
in. and that's how I got the blood on my
clothes. He was too heavy for me to
pack, but a stranger came along and with
his assistance we got Burk inside. Then
! ran to the drugstore at Third and How
ard street? to pet a doctor, but found
none. I did not know my wife had taken
the money and watch until she told the
policeman."
The woman corroborated Dempsey's
story. She said she took the money and
watch intending to give both to Ford and
have him send them to Burk's young
daughter, who lives in Portland.
The statement made by Ford forms the
strongest evidence against Dempsey and
the woman. He said that Burk had at
one time lived with Martha Ball, and that
Jealousy existed between- him and Demp
sey. which led to frequent quarrels.
Frank Traynor of 250 Natoma street
says that he helped carry Burk into
Dempsey's house. lie was attracted to
the place by the woman's exclamations.
He says Burk was not lying with hi.s
head on the cobbles, but lengthwise with
the sidewalk.
Vincent Zuper, an old man, who lives
next door to the Dempseys. says he heard
the men talking at the door and heard
one of them fall down the steps.
Autopsy Surgeon Leland found a folir
inch fracture in Burk"s skull. It extended
from the back of the head to a point in
front of the left ear. There was also a
contusion of the left cheek. The doctor
said the fracture could have been caused
by a fall.
There was nothing suspicious about the
case of Thomas Gill, who died at the
Dempsey residence March IS. He was an
old mar and lived in the basement. While
carrying some wood down the steps he
fell and soon afterward died. The au
topsy showed heart disease to have been
the cause.
The Coroner's inquest will be held next
Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 1900.
BIG FIGHT OVER
ADMISSION OF
PENCIL DEEDS
Attorney Denson Maintains
They Are Immaterial
as Evidence.
Counsel for Mrs. Craven Argues All
Day to Keep the Much-Discussed
Documents From Incum
bering Records.
?
Ex-Judpe B. C. Dcr.son. who was asso
ciated with "Smasher" Curtis, Delmas et
al. in the famous pencil deeds case, when
Mrs. Craven fought for the Mission and
Bafiaome street properties, talked morning
und afternoon yesterday before Judge.
Troutt against the rtsht of the respond
ents to introduce those same deeds as
evidence in the present case, wherein
Mrs. Craven seeks to prove she is the
v.l<3ow of the late Senator Fair. Weary
was the day, for It was packed with
heavy law from the text-books and adju
dicated cases. When Attorney Garret Me-
Encrney gets his flir.p at the question to
cay Judge Troutt will decide whether or
not the pencil deeds. are material to the
Issues of the present litigation and
v.'hether the respondents may or may not
friject them ir.to their case.
"We object to the Introduction of any
exhibits which tend to show the invalidity
cf the deeds or th*-. wiil of September 24.
en the grounds of incompetency. irrele
vancy and immateriality.." said Judge
Denson at the outset of his argument.
Continuing for four hours he went over
a f.cld of what was and what was not
admissible evidence. citing analogies,
identities as to fact and text-book au
thorities. He claimed that this attempted
phase of litigation was a sid^ issue for the
mere purpose of introducing another case
row pending before the Supreme Court.
"This evidence is not admissible," he
Eaid. "because it does not conform to the
EllepatioV.s. It is a collateral matter and
sheds no light en the marriage contract or
The is?ues of the case. The charge of
fraud and conspiracy is an affirmative
one. which cannot be proved by cross-ex
amination, as it raises collateral issues
which will lead to a trial of collateral
questions. The witness was interrogated,
no* on direct examination but on cross
examination, in regard to her possession
of the deeds."
When cross-examined some weeks ago
Mrs. Craven was asked what provision
Senator Fair had made for her as a wife
4ind she answered: "The deeds." The
respondents claim that this provision was
r.ot made; that the deeds are false and
spurious ar.d they desire to have this
proved.
D^nson argued that the provision for
the wife cuts no figure In the case. All
that is necessary, he claimed, was the
marriage contract and if respondents still
asseverate that this is forged let them
prove it without recourse to extraneous
documents.
McEr.prnpy will argue the question for
the respondents when court convenes this
morning.

They are not actually on their feet or
fanning a pneumonia case from 11 to 6.
Well, they .had their reward in the clean
rain-washed morning, when every runnel
of the Karoo was bankful and the waste
water (some day we shall get big dams
with a system to them) spilled away pro
fligately.
Our children were hungryâ mutinously
hungry. Officers fancied this and fancied
that; milkmen wanted to know why they
were not full dieters, and full dieters sent
verbal messages by orderlies asking for
more â much more.
"You won't get any breakfast till
they're all fed." said to me an orderly
with a pyramid of porridge basins.
"You'd better fill up on Osborne biscuits.
You see 'arf of 'em 'aven't the use of
their 'ands."
So they stoked themâ "the 'art that
'adn't the use of their "ands"â and they
redressed their bandages, and they
washed their little faces and combed their
little hair, and then the cry went up for
tobacco.
Some of the men had chansred past
recognition during the night. The lines
of pain, the terse, drawn expressions,
were gone. They had rested, their bellies
wre full, they were smoking. â¢
You must remember that a wounaerl

in superb physical condition; he has been
off all liquors for some months, and so
responds readily to stimulants; his blood
is clenn and he breathes the best of air.
Give him half a chance and he will
clamber up again hand over fist.
Then, all animal needs satisfied, some
of them wanted to send word home, and
that was a full morning's job.
The usual form ran: "Dear Mother-
Just a. few lines to tell you I was hit at
Paardeberg on February IS, when we

a plan for reorganizing' the Guard will be undertaken
it is not likely to be adopted as a whole. Another
bill provides for the appointment of a commission
consisting of one member of the Senate, one of the
House, two officers "of the United States army and
five officers of the National Guard to gather and com
pile information relating to the militia of the coun
try and report at -the next session of Congress a bill
for its reorganization and government. It is this
commission bill which will probably be adopted, for
there is a general desire that the whole question of
the relation of the Guard to the army shall be dealt
with in one comprehensive measure of reorganization
and reform, and the bill of Representative Hay docs
not fill all the requirements.
In every war in which the United States have been
engaged it has been demonstrated that the Govern
ment can depend upon a volunteer army to meet each
emergency as it arises. That fact, however, does not
weaken the importance of preparing plans by which
the volunteer force can be ' brought into action
promptly and with efficiency. The experience during
the war with Spain proved that the National Guard
of every State in the "Union is ready to fight as soon
as called upon, but it also proved that the existing or
ganization is defective in many respects. To remedy
those defects is a duty. which should be undertaken at
once.

THE ARMY AND THE NATIONAL
GUARD.
WHEN at the outbreak of the war with Spain
the Government undertook to provide
promptly a volunteer army to carry on the.
campaign the National Guard was naturally relied
upon tb furnish the force, and. as is well known, the
members of the Guard responded readily as soon as
called upon. In transferring the troops from the
State governments to that of the Union, however,
several difficulties were experienced, and as a result
there has been going on ever since an earnest agita
tion in favor of so reorganizing the Guard as to make
it a more effective reserve for the regular army than
it is at present.
Several schemes of : reorganization have been ad
vanced, but the one which has received most ap
proval is that of Representative I lay of Virginia, a
member of the Military Committee of the House.
His bill is not designed in any way to antagonize
I'.casurcs for an increase" of the regular army, but
solely to form a strong reserve force behind it upon
which it can draw readily in time of need not only
for men but for trained officers. For the purpose. of
effecting that object Mr. Hay proposes that appoint
ments as second lieutenant in the National Guard
shall be made after rigid examinations by army
boards and that all promotions shall be by merit.
Thus the Guard will" be made a training school for
officers and will be commanded by men well fitted to
continue in command when the reserve is called upon
for active service.
For the purpose of rendering the Guard fitted in
J other ways for the duties of a national reserve the
! bill provides for its equipment with the same arms ns
j regulars, the deposit of ample ordnance supplies in
the States by the General Government, a system of
mobilization by military divisions and the appropria
tion of $4,000,000 annually instead of the present
$400,000 for maintenance and equipment of the Guard
in the several States. . , /

Hold Primaries.
Guroy Gazette.
The professed determination of Burns'
clique of politicians, who constitute the
Republican Congressional Committee of
the Fifth District, to appoint delegates to
the national convention, deserves the
severest censure. There is certainly no
reputable Republican who favors any pri
mary except one conducted pubstaritiallv
in compliance with the election laws of
the State. -This is a matter as important
to Democrats as to Republicans, for the
people and not the politicians are entitled
to choose the men who shall formulate for
each party the issues on which the. cam
paign shall be iought out.
Reputable citizens want no "appointed"
delegates; they want no "wide-open" pri
maries, but orderly primaries in accord
ance with the forms of law. If the po
litical triumvirate at San Jose that is rep
resented in the Congressional committee
from this district has any genuine regard
for the welfare of the party in this coun
ty, they will unite in demanding of the
San Irancisco members of the committee
that primaries be held. Otherwise there
is likely to be a visitation of wrath from
the voters in n*xt November that will
prove a severe lesson. .;
A Mexican newspaper, in a very subtle discussion,

OUR TRADE WITH THE ORIENT.
WHILE the enactment of the bill authorizing
the President to appoint five commissioners
' to visit the Orient for the purpose of studying
the best methods of promoting trade with the coun
tries of that part of the world is commendable, it is
to be noted that our Oriental trade has been expand
ing veiy rapidly without the aid of a commission. In
fact; our merchants, in their efforts to find a market
in China and Japan, appear to be doing about all
they can do so long as they are hampered by the lack
of a merchant marine sufficient to compete with the
heavily subsidized lines of European countries.
According to statistics just issued from the Treas
ury Department our exports to Japan in the fiscal
year 1893 were but $3,195494 and in 1899 they were
$17,264,688 and seem likely to be $26,000,000 in the
fiscal year 1900. To China our exports in 1893 were
$3,900,457 and in the present fiscal year will be in
round terms $15,000,000. To Hongkong our exports
during this period have, been doubled, being $4,216,
602 in 1893. and promise to be over $8,000,000 for the
present fiscal year. Â¦
While that showing of the rapidity with [which our
trade with the Orient is increasing is gratifying, it h
to be borne in mind there is a menace in it. for it is
quite possible that in the East, where the danger of
Chinese immigration is not fully understood, there
may grow up a desire to promote trade with China
and Japan by granting concessions in 'the way of
freer admission to the United States. The inrush of
Japanese has already become a serious evil, and the
records of this port show that the exclusion act is
evaded by Chinese. . "
Two points in our relations with the Orient arc
therefore to be borne in mind. First, we should carry
our trade in our own ships, and second, we should
carefully avoid trying to promote commerce at the ex
pense of the welfare of American labor. There is
ample opportunity for an immense market for our
products in China and Japan, and to profit by it there
is no need for any relaxation of the policy of the
country to prevent the importation of coolies.

THE TURKISH TROUBLE.
1 is evident that the Sultan will avoid any trouble
with this country over the adjustment of damages
for the destruction of missionary property.
Turkey is the only non-Christian power in a nomi
nally Christian Europe. In area governed, in pop
ulation, power and influence, Turkey is a hopeless
minor. This condition of minontv is emphasized by
the fact that many high oiticers ot the Sultan are, at
least nominally, Christians. Many Turkish diplo
mats in important posts have for years been Chris
tians. This means that Turkey is influenced by its
nommally Christian environment, and that environ
ment does not feel the non-Christian influence of Tur
key.
Since the days of John Sobieski there has been no
prospect of Turkey in any way dominating European
affairs, cither by conquest or diplomacy. No nation
in Europe is afraid of Turkey. Any one of the sec
ond-class powers could wipe out that empire. Its
safety rests upon the inability of the first-class powers
to agree upon a division of the Ottoman estate, and
upon the danger of rousing the Sheik ul Islam, the
spiritual head of Mahometanism. to declare a holy
war against the Giaour, which would affect the Chris
tian nations of Europe that have millions of Mahom
etan subjects.
It is true that the United States, by a powerful at
tack upon Turkey, independently made, could prob
ably destroy the empire of the Sultan, but what then?
We could not administer upon the estate. We could
not occupy it. We could not appropriate our con
quest and appear as a European power, with jurisdic
tion extending from the Balkans to the Bosphorus.
Nor could we well hand over our conquest to' one
European power or distribute it amongst the several
powers which might take it off our hands. We are
demanding $100,000 indemnity from Turkey for the
destruction of missionary compounds. It will cost
that to send one warship through the Dardanelles,
and to bombard and whip Turkey into submission
would run the cost far into the millions. The sum
total could be assessed to Turkey as the price of
peace. But the world is aware that payment of a war
indemnity of many millions is not ;\ ithin the power of
that empire, whose people are now overtaxed and
proper objects of pity and commiseration. A war,
therefore, would leave Turkey more heavily in our
debt than now, with a poorer prospect of payment,
since war would decrease her ability to pay us the
It is not likely, therefore, that our guns will wake
the echoes of old Stamboul. Diplomacy will settle
the issue, and the missionaries will get their money.
It is worthy of note that all of our recent Ministers
to Turkey, from S. S. Cox to the present one, Mr.
Straus, have willingly borne testimony to the integ
rity and high intelligence of the Sultan. Abdul Ha
mid.
To maintain his empire in Europe he must have r.
kren knowledge of European diplomacy and of the
dynastic and territorial ambitions of its rulers. That
he possesses this is evident from the address with
winch he balances one nation against another. This
knowledge made him perfectly safe in accepting the
Grecian challenge to war and in chastising that trucu
lent kingdom.
He uill not provoke war with us, nor will he make
a settlement of our clsim a precedent which his
Christian neighbors may use to force him to make
concessions to them President McKinley may be
safely trusted to protect all American interests, and

AUSTRALIA AND THE BRITISH CROWN
AFTER all their years of effort to devise a sys
tem of federal union it appears the Australian
people have adopted a constitution, or, as they
call it, "a commonwealth bill," which is not satisfac
tory to the British Government. The measure has
been under consideration by Parliament for some
time and eminent Australians have been summoned
to London to confer upon it, but as yet no satisfac
tory solution of the difficulty has been devised.
The London Chronicle in a recent issue says the
law officers of the Crown object to clause 74 of the
bill, and adds:
"The clause in question confers on Australia the
sole right of interpreting the constitution unless the
point happens to affect some portion of the empire
outside Australia. Taking exception to this, the legal
advisers of the imperial government have proposed
that there should be added to the Privy Council, sit
ting as a court of appeal, a department in which Brit
ish and Australian Judges should alike have places.
A measure bringing this about would be introduced
into Parliament by the Government, and no doubt it
would be passed. Under such a system, it is argued,
appeals from Australia would come before a tribunal
adequately representative of that country, while at
the same time the imperial link implied in the Privy
Council would remain unimpaired. That, stated
briefly, is the proposal which is being submitted to
the Premiers of Australia."
While the plan .proposed by the imperial govern
ment may appear fair upon its face, there remains the
difficulty that the Australian Premiers have- no
authority to amend the commonwealth bill. The
measure was adopted by a vote of the people of the
several colonies, and many efforts had to be made be
fore a favorable vote was given. If now the British
Government insists upon amending the measure an
other vote will have to be taken by the electors and
that would mean the possibility of the defeat of the
whole federation scheme. Naturally the Australian
statesmen hesitate to take such risksi and so the issue
stands.
It has been suggested that under, any circumstances
it would be desirable to give the colonies represen
tation in the Privy Council, since that would tend to
make the Council the "germ of an imperial federal
senate," and thus be a long stride in the direction of
the much talked of federation of the mother country
and the colonies. The Australians, however, appear
to be in nowise pleased with the offer. One of them.
Walter Griffiths, Mi P., of South Australia is quoted
as having said when questioned on the subject:
'"We are loyal to the mother country, but our loy
alty must be purely voluntary; the slightest sugges
tion of compulsion will estrange our people beyond
recall, with the result that a United States of Aus
tralia, a republic modeled on American lines, will be
added to the independent powers of the earth."
The conditions of the empire are such that the Aus
tralians have, only to stand firm to compel the im
perial government to ratify their constitution without
change. They are certainly justified in claiming for
themselves the sole right of interpreting their consti
tution, and this is as good a time to bring that ques
tion to an issue and settlement as any that is ever
likely to arise.

go to the wash, and they swish and swill

To-morrow night its work begins again.
THE OLD ISSUE AGAIN.
ALTGELD evidently understands his party. In
declaring that there will be no modification of
the Chicago platform he has uttered the pur
pose of the Bryan hosts. The most prominent
spokesman of that party in the House is Champ Clark
of Missouri. Recently, in an issue-making speech in
that body, he said: "The free and unlimited coinage
of gold and silver at the historical ratio of 16 to I.
without waiting for the consent of any other nation
on earth, will be the supreme issue in 1900, as it was
in 1896. Upon that platform we will place Bryan and
elect him. Self-seeking politicians, timorous soul?,
may fall away from us, but the paramount issue and
the peerless candidate will remain. Politicians do
not make issues, the people make them. And they
make something else. They make politicians and
when politicians do not suit them they unmake poli
ticians and make a new set who do suit them. They
want Bryan and the fref and unlimited coinage of
gold and silver at 16 to i, and these they intend to
have."
Nearly every Bryan man in Congress uttered the
same determination and emphasized it by hissing Mr.
Cleveland's name every time it was mentioned. It
is amongst the things certain now, in advance of the
conventions, that the Democratic purpose is to usj
any and every public question as a means of getting
votes, in order to secure power to wreck the exist
ing financial system of the country. About half of
Bryan's party arc expansionists. This is especially
true of the South, where the percentage may be put
higher than half and be within the fact. -But they
hold their views subordinate to their set determina
tion to put the county upon an actual silver basis by
free coinage at what Colonel Bryan has called "the
divinely appointed ratio." The sound money men of
the country should not sleep on their arms nor for a
moment underestimate the power and purpose of
their opponents.
In the beginning of their movement these fanatics
described gold as the money of the rich and silver as
the money of the poor and declared themselves for
the poor man's money. The recent law establishing
the gold standard and making every dollar of silver
and currency equal to a dollar in gold has put on a
firm and equal basis every dollar of every kind in cir
culation amongst us. Every wage earner's dollar is
a gold dollar with the stability in purchasing power
of that metal. Not even a demagogue can any more
talk of a poor man's money and a rich man's money.
If there ever existed any such kinds of money, if the
description were true when it was invented, then the
Republican party must have the credit of raising the
money of the poor to a perfect par and equality with
the money of the rich. Colonel Bryan desires free
coinage of silver: the effect of that will be to estab
lish silver as the actual standard and to drag the poor
man's money down from a par and equality with gold
to about 50 cents on the dollar.
We appeal to the millions of wage earners to decide
whether they wish Chis to happen. With a constantly
rising wage the money in which it is paid is gold.
Every laborer with a time check can cash it in gold
on demand: or he can exchange any form of currency
in which it is cashed for gold at par and without los;.
When he goes into the market to- buy the necessaries
of life for his family his dollar is as good as the mil
lionaire's, buys as much and goes as far.
It is the first time in the history of this country
that such a condition has been embedded in the. law
of ihe land, entrenched, secured and defended by an
act oi Congress. It is the first time that in respect
to finance the wage worker and the millionaire have
been upon terms of exact equality. And let it be re
membered that this has been done, not by dragging
the millionaire down, but by raising the wage worker
up. Can any supporter of Colonel Bryan point to
an act of any other party in all our history that has
accomplished such a majestic equalizing of financial
conditions by such a process?
In all of his perpetual, peripatetic campaign of
hatred an I complaint Colonel Bryan has maintained
but one idea, advocated one theory, threatened one
thing, r.nd that has been punishment of the rich Â«jy
dragging them back to the level of the poor in re
spect to the intrinsic value of money. This threat
has been seen and answered by the Republican party
giving the poor the best money in the world, and
thereby, if inequality in that condition existed at all,
abolishing it by elevating the poor to equality with
the rich.
To reverse this is the avowed policy of Colon?l
Bryan in the campaign of this year. He will have
millions of wage earners to reckon with. They re
member the years of famine and will not vote to have
less food on their tables, less clothes on their back 3
and less fire on their hearths in order to gratify Colo
nel Bryan's ambition.

CAPTAIN DEMING
PLEADS GUILTY
TO THE CHARGES
Sudden End of the Military
Court-Martial at the
Presidio.
Accusations of Forgery and Embez
zlement of Government Funds
Admitted by the Ac
cused Officer.
* â¢
The postponed sitting of the military
J court-ruartial which was set for yesterday
j at the PresiOio came to an abrupt ter
mination shortly after Major Stephen "vV.
Groesbeck, the judge advocate, had fin
ished reading thf charges against the ac
cused. Captain Peter C. Demlng, commis
sary of subsistence of the United States
i volunteers, by the latter pleading grullty
! to all of the specifications.
Yesterday's session was the third of the
court, as on two former occasions an ad
journment was had to give the accused
an opportunity to defend himself and pre
pare for trial. Attorney Crittendert
Thornton had been retained for the de
fense. When the judge advocate finished
reading the charges the attorney and his
client liPld a short consultation, and the
erring man In a subdued voice stammered
lout. "Guilty es charged."
In mitigation of the offenses. Attorney
| Thornton, in ppeaking of Captain Dem
: ings error, said that restitution had been
! made of the funds taken from private In
i dividual!*.' although not of those taken
| from the Government. He had furnished
,' two witnesses to prove that this restitu
' Lien had been mad*, and hoped for thÂ©
clemency of the court in recognizing thiÂ»>
!as a mitigation of the offense. Major
| Grcesbeek. said that this could not affect
the main charge, a clear case of forgery
ur.der exceptionally aggravating circum
stances, as the check presented on the
i Government bank was or.c issued to dls
j burging officers of the United States only.
At the conclusion of Attorney Thorn
i ton's plea for mercy the court held a'con
| crul tat ion. In less than thirty minutes the
whole proceedings were disposed of. Th<9
decision was forwarded to General Shaf
ter for his indorsement, after which it
will be submitted to President McKJnley
for final approval.

TRANS-ATLANTIC TRAVELERS
Furnished Special Attendants by the
Pennsylvania System.
The bureau of attendants for trans-Atlantic
travelers established In Jersey City and New
Tork City twenty years ago by the Pennsyl-
vania System, has proven a great convenience
to persons making European trips and to
tourists arriving in America at that port. It
will be particularly convenient for visitors to
tho Paris Exposition because the departure
docks of most of the Atlantic Steamship Lines
are convenient to the new Jersey City Passen-
ger Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company.
This bureau consists of experienced aprnts
whoee duties are to meet passengers arriving
In Jersey City and New Tork over the Penn-
sylvania Lines and assist them In arranging
for trans-Atlantic trips via any of the steam-
ship lines by conducting them to steamships
and aiding In preparations for a trip abroad.
.These agents will provide cabs operated by
the Pennsylvania System and aid passengers
with their baggage. They ar* fully posted on
matters pertaining to steamshtps leaving New
Tork and arrangements can be made through
them' for procuring steamship tiekeu In ati-
They also meet Incoming eteamships to aid
travelers in shaping details for continuing
journeys from New Tork over the Pennsyl-
vania Line* by furnishing tickets, arranging
for the transfer cf baggage from steamship
docks after It has been passed by customs In-
spectors, and having the same checked through
to destination. They will reserve sleeping car
accommodation* and relieve persons of the
forego!"* details, making themselves useful as
attendants and guides free of charge.

WILL SPRINKLE ALL
THE BUSINESS STREETS
Merchants' Association Will Perform
This Work Until City Con
tracts Are Let.
The Merchants' Association has decided
to systematically sprinkle at its own ex
pense the principal business streets of the
city for a period of thirty days or longer,
for the purpose of giving' the citizens an
object lesson of the benefits to be derived
from general, sprinkling and to abate as
much as possible the present annoyance
from dust, until the city awards- a con
tract for sprinkling tho business streets
as required by the charter.
A special permit has been secured from
the Board of Supervisors to sprinkle the
bituminous rock streets, in order that the
association may experiment and ascertain
whether it is possible by sprinkling with
a very fine spray to keep down the dust
and yet not make the pavement slippery.
Smashed His Father's Glass Eye.
James McGuire, the young hoodlum
who brutally attacked his father, Frank
McGuire, 910 Illinois street, Saturday
night, appeared before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday, but the case was continued un
til to-day. The father appeared in court
with two black eyes. He wore a glass
eye and it was smashed in pieces by the
son. About a month ago the father had
the son arrested for vagrancy, but the
mother and two daughters pleaded so
hard for him that the case was dismissed.
Yesterday he tried to put the blame of
assault upon his mother, who had be

IV. PHOTOGRAPHY IN COLORS.
(Concluded.)
There are two other methods of color
photography more recent and somewhat
more direct than the three-color process.
These are the Interference method of
Lippmann and the diffraction method in
vented by Wood.
Lippmann's Interference Method.
.In this method two things are necessary
âa transparent photographic film not
granular in structure and a metallic mir
ror. Suppose that the film is in direct
contact with the mirror and that a beam
of light of a single color â that is. a single
wave length â fall upon it. The light
passes through the film, strikes the mir
ror and a train of waves is sent back
through the film. These reflected waves
meet the oncoming direct waves and the
result is the establishment of what are
called "stationary" or "standing" waves,
such as may be seen when a tight string
is vibrating violently as a whole or in
equal parts. At certain points the direct
and the reflected wave urge the string in
the same direction and the result Is a
motion which is the sum of two; at points
midway between these points of greatest
motion the direct and the reflected wave
urge the string in opposite directions and
the result is no motion at all. A similar
e'Tect may sometimes be seen in water
when the waves are reflected frum a
smooth rock or the planks of a pier or a
ship.
Such an action as this taking place
within the film produces planes of maxi
mum light action and planes of minimum
action half a wave length away from
them. The emulsion will be acted upon
at the planes of greatest motion and not
at all at the planes of no motion. There
will, therefore, be strata of metallic silver
deposited, the distance between adjacent
strata depending upon the wave length.
The strata formed by the action of violet
light will be nearest together and those
due to red light farthest apart, and even
in a thin film there will be as many as
500 of these layers of deposited silver.
If instead of light of a * ingle color the
colored image formed by a. lens falls upon
the sensitive film and mirror, the- result
will be a distribution throughout the film
of layers differently spaced at each point
in accordance with the color.
Seeing the Image.
When white light Is allowed to fall upon
a plate obtained In this way. It is reflected
at each of the planes within the film and
Interference takes place in such a way
that the light of the particular color
which formed the planes is strengthened
and all other colors are diminished. It is
the same action which gives color to a
soap bubble. Part of the light is reflected
at thÂ« first surface, part goes through
and is reflected at the next and Join* a
wave reflected at the flrst.*As the extra
distance traveled is an exact multiple of
the wave-length of the color that pro
duced the layers, the light of that par
ticular color In each of the reflected
waves will be In the same part of a vibra
tion and the color will be strengthened.
For light of any other color the two re
flected waves will be in different parts of
a vibration when they join again and will
therefore be partly or wholly destroyed.
If there were only two planes the select
ive strengthening of the reflected light of
one wave length would not be marked.
But, as there are hundreds of planes, one
after another, the final result Is that prac
tically only light of one colorâ the color
that produced the planes at that point
emerges from the film.
The Manipulation.
The plate Is placed In a tight holder
with the film side at the back. The space
at the back Is then flooded with mercury
and the exposure is made. There Is no
other change from the usual practice, the
operations of developing and fixing being
as usual.
The plate must be viewed at the samÂ»
angle at which it was taken. For, if the
incident Is changed the colors change, the
red changing to orange, yellow, green ana
so on to the violet end: and if any part of
the film is wet it swells, the distance be
tween the layers increases and the color*
change in the opposite order.
Wood's Diffraction Method.
A still more recent method is that due to
Wood, in which the color effect is pro
duced by diffraction. Before describing
the process, therefore, we must first un
derstand what diffraction Is and what ef
fects it produces.
Nothing in regard to light is more flrmlr
impressed on the mind than that It casA
sharp shadows. This, however, is entirely
a question of degree. The Impression is
just as firm that sound does not cast sharp
shadows. The existence or the absence of
shadows depentle on tire relation between*
the length of wave and the size of thÂ»
obstacle. The water on the leeward sld<Â»
of a ship is comparatively smooth, if not
quite so; and sound shadows occur behind
large obstacles. Water waves bend around
a stake just as sound waves bend around
small obstacles. Light waves do the same
thing, but as the light waves are so very
short the obstacle must be very small to
produce the effect of the stake in tha
water. A body of the dimensions of a
hair or a fine line on glass will do this,
and when the different sets of waves meet
on the other side they interfere, causing
added light where crest meets crest and
destroying each other where crest meets
trough. Thus alternate bands of light
and darkness are produced which may be
clearly seen under favorable conditions
with the proper apparatus. This effect is
very greatly increased by ruling a great
many lines close together, the lines all be
ing of the same width and separated by
spaces of the same width. Such a set oC
ruled lines on glass or on other transpar
ent or highly reflecting body 13 called a
diffraction grating."
Action of Diffraction Grating.
If the Image of a light of one color only,
such as the yellow sodium flame, is formed
by a lens upon a screen, and a grating put
in front of the lens, there appear other
yellow Images on either nide of the central
image separated from it and from each
other by dark space?. If the color of tha
light Is blue the spacing of the side im
ages is smaller, each blue image falling
nearer the central line than the corre
sponding yellnw. and imagea from a red
source -would have wider spacing than the
yellow. In this way white Usht la broken
up by a grating and spread out into a
series of spectra on either side of the cen
tral line. Moreover, the spacing of tha
lines of the gratinsr determines the dis
tances separating the upectra. finer ruling
causing the images to spread out more
widely. Evidently, then, by using" grat
ings of different fineness of ruling wÂ« may
cause the spectrum produced by the aec
ondâthe spectrum nearest to the central
image since it is the brightestâ to lap
upon the spectrum produced by the first,
and that of the third grating to lap upon
the two otfier?. Indeed, the rullnjr of the
gratings may be carefully determined, so
that the rÂ»d from the first, the green from
the second and the violet from the third
will all fall upon the same spot. An eye
placed at that spot would see red, green.
violet or any of their compounds. Includ
ing white, according to the relative
strengths of the simple component colors.
It is this action which is the foundation
of Wood's method.
The Process.
From what has been said it Is evident
that this method is in a sense a three
color method, but the primary colors used
are pure ?pectrnm colors which by an In
genious arrangement are produced auto
matically in tho film itself. In the fin
ished positive the red component at each
point Is represented by a portion of the
grating producing red at the view point:
the green component by a portion of the
grreen-producing gratln? and th.Â» vlole*
component by a portion of t&a gratis*
prcducins: violet.
HEAVY FINE IMPOSED
ON SALMON PACKERS
Judge Morrow Demonstrates That
There Is No Profit in Con
tempt of Court.
Joseph Hume, Hume Brothers and the
Hume Salmon Packing Company were be
fore United States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday to show cause why they should
not be punished for contempt for having
disobeyed an order of the court prohibit
ing them from Infringing the patent on a
certain machine used for filling salmon
cans.
It was alleged and proved that the de
fendants had been violating the injunction
since March, 1597. Judge Morrow found
the defendants guilty of contempt and
imposed a fine of $2500, together with costs
and $250 counsel fees. It was also ordered
that if the fine was not paid in five days
Joseph Hume, the legally responsible head
of the defendant firm, should be impris
oned until the fine should have been paid,
â¢raid period of Imprisonment not to exceeu
six months.
It was ordered further that the machine
used by the Hume corporation be sur
rendered to the United States Marshal,
the Marshal being ordered to destroy the
sanse.

Murder Charge Dismissed.
The cafe of Patrick S. Higglns, bar
tender in Harry Bentham's saloon. Six
teenth and Valencia streets, charged with
the murder of John Flannigan, a young
plumber, was dismissed by Judge Conlan
yesterday, a? no complaint had been filed.
Flannigan and a companion went into the
saloon at an early hour in the morning
and Higgins refused to serve them with
liquor, as they appeared to be intoxicated.
They bwame abusive and Higgins put
them out. Flannigan fell and fracmred
his skull.
ATTORNEY J. N. E. WILSON, who
appeared yesterday in United
States Commissioner Heacock's
court representing Bert Herrington
In the case of the United States vs. Kirn
Quey. was hoisted clean out of the case
by his own petard. His client turned the
tables on the gang of highbinders that
were fighting for the possession of her
self as a chattel, and the ring was filled
with consternation. If her story is true
one lawyer may be disbarred.
Kirn Quey wafe arrested at Mayfield by
Chinese Inspector Gardner for being ille
gally in the country, he having discovered
that she was one of the show women who
had come here to take part in the exposi
tion at Omaha. Bert Herrington took her
In a bupgy and drove away from the town,
but was overtaken by Dr. Gardner. Her
rington jumped out of the buggy and
made his escape and the woman was re
arrested.
In the deportation proceedings yester
days morning before United States Court
Commissioner Heacoek. Dr. Gardner was
the first and only witness. He testified
that the woman was a laborer and had
no certificate of registration or other
paper entitling her to remain in this coun
try. Then Mr. Wilson walked into the
trap. He asked the witness if the woman
had not testified at Mayfield that she was
a native of the United States. The in
spector replied that she had. and that she
had afterward confessed that her testi-
mony on that occasion wa3 false, that the
truth was that she had come here with
the Omaha Exposition people and that she
had never been here before.
Dr. Gardner then proceeded to tell the
remainder of her confession. The story
had been taught her, he said, by Wong
Fong. the Chinaman charged with abduct
ing her; by Wong Sing, the man who
afterward went through a form of mar
riage ceremony with her, and by Lawyer
Herrlngton.
According to her statement they said:
"You must testify thus in order to clear
us, for if you don't our Hves*wouldn't be
worth anything. We would be hanged.
You must say that you were born in San
Francisco; that you never were out of San
Francisco; that you were not willing to
stay In the Chinese Mission Home; that
you wanted to go away with Wong Ling
Ting; that you had known him for more
than a year and that you wished to marry
himâ in fact, that you had married him;
that you love him and that he is your hus
band. You will say also that everything
that has been done with you has been
done with your consent. If you don't tes
tify as we say a bullet will be" put through
your head."
Mr. Wilson announced at this point that
he would withdraw from the case. It was
Mr. Herrington's case, he said, anyhow.
The court took a recess until 11:30 o clock
to allow Mr. Herrlngton an opportunity of
putting In an appearance, but he did not
come, and the proceedings were continued
until this afternoon at 2 o'clock.

WATER FRONT
Battleship lowa Sails for
Puget Sound to Go on
the Drydock.
One of the Man-of- War's Crew Went
Overboard With His Bicycle,
but Man and Machine
Were Rescued.
The battleship lowa sailed for Puget
Sound yesterday. Ort her arrival at Seat
tle she will go on the Port Orchard dry
dock, where she will remain for five days.
While there she will receive a- thorough
overhauling, after which she will return to
San Francisco, arriving here May 17.
Admiral Kautz did not go out on the
lowa. He will make his headquarters
ashore until" the battleship returns or the
Boston comes down from Mare Island.
Captain Goodrich is in command of the
big fighting machine and will see to her
docking and undoeking at Port Orchard.
There was a ludicrous accident at the
Folsom street float a few minutes before
the last launch left for the lowa. One of
the gunner's mates had purchased a. bi
cycle, and a darky sailor was taking it
aboard the warship for him. When the
Bailor got on the float at Peterson's boat
house he attempted to show the men in
the launch how easy it was to ride the
machine. Once he got started he could
not stop, and rode into the bay. Luckily
he could swim, and it was not long before
he was back on the float minua the bicy
cle. The darky did not waste any time
bewailing his fate, but stripping off his
heavy clothes took a dive into the water,
and in about thirty seconds came up with
the machine. He passed it up to the men
in the launch and then clambered aboard
after it.
Auxiliary Bark Tsukishima Maru.
For the first time in the history of the
port an auxiliary bark-rigged merchant
man arrived in port last Saturday. She
was built and outfitted in Japan and car
ries a full complement of the "little brown
men" as a crew. She came from Hako
date with a cargo of VM) tons sulphur In
the good time of twenty-eight days, the
usual passage for a sailing vessel being
forty-five days, and expects to go back to
Yokohama in steamboat time. She is a
handsome vessel and does credit to her
Japanese designers and builders.
Bear Sails To-Morrow.
The Seattle andPuget Sound papers gen
enally have been full of stories of the rev
enue cutter Bear chasing the British
steamer Alpha in order to prevent her
landing supplies and passengers at Nome.
There being no sub-port at the new gold
fields none but American vessels can land
there. In spite of that fact the Alpha
cleared from Victoria. B. C, and is now
on her way north with passengers and
cargo. According to the Seattle papers
the Bear is supposed to be after the Brit
isher, whereas she is still in port and will
not pass out through the Golden Gate un
til to-morrow afternoon.
Laguna a Total Loss.
News reached the city yesterday that
the steamer Laguna, which went ashore
at Tlllamook, is a total loss. She left here
last month with supplies for the mill at
Tillamook and was to bring back a load
of lumber. While trying to cross in over
the bar she Ktruck, and. went ashore
among the breakers. At that time it was
thought she could be got off and repaired.
All efforts have failed, however, and the.
Laguna is now a total wreck according to
advices received by the Merchants' Ex
change yesterday.
The Laguna was built in IRSS at Hay &
Wright's shipyard and was one of the
best known steam schooners on the coast.
She was 116 feet long. 30 feet beam and 9
feet deep, carrying about 300,000 feet of
lumber. T. Pojlard of this city was her
managing owner. The loss of the vessel
will come heavily on the owners at this
tlm*\ as it is impossible to either charter
or build a vessel, to replace her.
Bark Fortuna oh Fire.
News was received by the Merchants*
Exchange yesterday that the Norwegian
bark For tuna was on fire in Honolulu
harbor. She arrived from Newcastle. N.
S W.. with a cargo of coal, and while
awaiting inspection by the quarantine of
ficer fire broke out in the lower hold. The
steamer Miowera arrived in port while the
bark was burning, and the Mall boat's of
ficers report that when they sailed tht.
cargo was being discharged and every ef
fort made to- pave the vessel. The San
Francisco agents of the Fortuna are Hind.

The Zeatandia comes off the drydock
this morning: and the transport Warren
takes her place. The Zealar.dia will dock
at Pacific street and will be fitted out foi
her trip to Nome. After a few days on
the drydeck the Warren will load and sail
for Manila with â¬00 recruits and a full

fell into the hold, fracturing three of his
ribs besides receiving internal injuries. He
was treated at the Harbor Hoxpital by Dr.
Morrison and afterward sent home in an
ambulance.
Henry Reed was arrested hy Sergeant
Tom Ellis yesterday and charged at the

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, April 23.â There was a whole
bunch of bearish consideration presented for
view litf the wheat pit at the beginning of
trade. Cables were easier, world's shipments
heavy, there was an Increase on passage and
the weather continued favorable. It was ex
pected that there would be considerable liqui
dation on May this week, but It did not ma
terialize early. Prices were fairly firm for a
couple of hours after the initial concession of
about a quarter of a cent. Later the stuff
began to come out, however, and there was
selling in sympathy with .the break in corn.
May had hesitatoil early, balking at the 65c
mark, but the liquidation carried the price
through that. The market was very weak at
this time, but the selling paved the way for
the reaction which began during the t after
noon. The short sellers concluded not to re
main In that condition over night and bought
back some of their early sales and turned what
looked like a Lull rout into a sort of retreat
in good orde"r. as the dispatches have it. The
cash business was slack and the export in
quiry rather discouraging to holders. Trade
was dull In spots, but the session furnished
considerable animation most of the time. May
cpened at e.'i'mC to CoftCSHc sold between 65UC
and 64HC and closed Â»Â»c under Saturday at
64vÂ»565c. July opened at U6Â»4c to ee^^bOSc.
ranged from 66?ic to 66VÂ»c and closed %tfVj(J
down at 66*Â»c. Much of the trade was done
In changing May for July at a difference
of Vie.
The corn market was active and lower. The
feature and the factor was liquidation of May,
although lower cables and the Increase on
passage were Items In favor of the bear side.
The opening was a trifle lower. Shorts were
B?Ilers, but covered later and thus caused a
partial recovery. The bulk of the Duslness was
in the way of changing. May closed He under
Saturday at 37TÂ«c; July closed HÂ©VÂ«c down at
Â£9<!g3SHc. ,
Provisions were active and fluctuations for
the greater part of the session wide. Hog re
ceipts were liberal and prices at the yard
lower. There was a heavy selling pressure in
evidence at the start. Buying by packers
caused a reaction and the close was firm.
May pork closed 274 c under Saturday at $12 45;
July 20c down at $12 624; May lard unchanged
at $6 92^s ; July unchanged at $7 021?; May
ribs 5c lower at $6 85; July 5c down at J6 90.
The oats market held its own despite the
weakness displayed early by corn. There was
a good demand from both shorts nnd longs.
May and July closed a shade higher at 22-jsÂ®
22% c and Â£3e respectively.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

EASTERN MARKETS.
Nni' York Stock Market
NEW YORK, April 23â Saturday's break in
prices of Flocks brought large selling orders
into the market and they were in evidence
all through the list at the opening. But there
wee also buying orders on a very large scale
to take the offered stock. Part of these were
plentifully placed in the market by friends of
different stocks for the purpose of supporting
them. The expectation was quite general that
the market would open with something like a
crasih In values, but as !s not unusual in Wall
Ftreet overexpectation defeated itself and i
there were enough buyers waiting to take ad- ]
vantage of the crash to steady the market j
almost immediately. Professional Wall street j
j>erceived the absence of pressure of long 1
stock in the eteel industries with the cynical
lack of surprise. Evidently the opportunity I
had been seized to dispose of long stock at the j
higher level of price* and the shorts were the |
most eager curators in the market in the en- j
deavor in cover. This pretty clearly indicated 1
a pause In the most aggress.ive tactics of the 1
bear campaign. A collateral object of that I
campaijrn is generally believed to be to take
on various stocks at the lower level of prices.
The pressure of liquidation continued heavy
during the firM hour and a second drive was
made by the bears at the end of that time. Â¦
But thÂ»Â» eu-ady absorption of offerings bepot a
very cautious mood among the professionals :
and a decidedly qcirter tone ensued in the
market. f?on:e cf the bull pools which have
recently bf-en active, notably that In Missouri
Pacific, showed a disjosition to resume opera
tions. The undertone of the market was firm ;
during the latter part of the day and at the
dose was Etrong and rather active, with the
ftÂ»-Â«-l industries at the best level cf the day
&t a considerable net gain, amounting to 2\
in th* case of Federal Steel and 2H in Steel
and Wire. Wall street still keeps an eye on
the situation in the iron and steel trade, but
4r inclined to go back r>f official uttt-rances
in forming Its opinion. The alarm flrsi cre
ated over the cut in price* is mitigated by
the wel!-Siled ranks of the consumers who
are known to be waiting to place contracts
fct a lower level cf prices. Last year's high
prices arc known to have been made by be
lated bidders who had to buy at any price to
fill contracts, and the dealings at the high level
were for only a small part of the total pro
duct. A larce part of last year's business was
on old contracts which u-t-re known to have
fo^en worked off at lower rates. While the re
duction in current rates has proved a severe
shock to the financial world and a great d'.f
cpp^lntment to holders of the stocks of the
eteel companies Wall street Is beginning to
Indulge the hope that at cut prices the year's
average rate may still prove to be tbove the
average for last year. Gold exports are l<x>ked
to -without alarm <n account of the enÂ»<? of the
mÂ«~>n*-y market. To-day's Â¦mall shipment to
Buenos Ayres was without Influence.
The feature of the bond market was thÂ»
quick rise to 85 3 i of thÂ» Western New York

NEW YORK. April 23.â The Commercial Ad
vert lser> London financial cablegram says:
The markets to-day were all very flat, from
consols to mines, and business was meager.
Adverse rumors were current. Including the
extraordinary whisper of an Impending war
with France over African disputes after the
exhibition. A decline in the war loan to 13-16
per oent premium suggested further â¢borrow
ing, following Lord Edmund Fltzmaurice's es
timate of the' financial cont of the war at
i: 130. 000. C00. A break in American Â»?curltles
was also a diFturblng influence this morning
und London lopt heart, opening below parity
for the first time since the late rise began.
Hopeless of New York support this department
was weak all day and would have broken
badly If there had been any pressure to sell.
New York came a feller and the close In the
rtrert was flat at the worst. The only firm
Â¦pot was Norfolk and Western on "shop" sup
port. Paris falling to support Tlntas they fell
I' 4 to 67H: Anacondas y~ to 9 9-16. The Bank
of England bought 1:51,000 gold in Germany.
It is hinted that gold Is In transit from New
York, but tliat the fact Is kept very close, a
moderate sum due the Bank of England was
renewed and there was some frrsh borrowing,
but no discount business. There is talk of an
early reduction of the German bank rate to 5
per cent.

TROUBLE AT CHICAGO
Dance in His Honor May Be Called

SpÂ«dal Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 23.â 1t developed to
night that Hobart Chatfield-Taylor, chair
man of the committee having In charge
the arrangements for the Dewey Day ball
to be given at the Auditorium on the night
of May 30, Is in trouble. He learned to
day that an enterprising "dance pro
moter" has rented the First Regiment
Armory, and ur*ier the auspices of the
Naval Reserve Veteran Association pro
poses to give a rival ball. He has flooded
the town with mvltatlons which are re
productions as to appearance, at least, of
the Invitations sent out by the Chatneld-
Taylor comnHttee. and has billed the levee
district like a circus with advertisements
of his ball, which Bet forth that Admiral
and Mrs. Dewey will grace the occasion
with their presence, all for $1 per ticket.
Chatfleld-Taylor declares to-night that
Admiral Dewey must promise he will not
attend the Naval Reserve ball or the big
fashionable function at the Auditorium
will not be given. The "dance promoter"
made a proposition to the Naval Associa
tion to give It $1000 in cash and to pay
certain debts for permission to give the
ball In Its name.
When Admiral Dewey was still in Ma
nila he was invited by the association to
be Its guest should he ever visit Chicago.
DIVES TO HIS DEATH
INTO A COKE OVEN
Unknown Man's Horrible Method of
Suicide at a Pennsylvania
Foundry.
CONNELLSVILLE, Pa., April 23.â
Leaping high into the air, as an expert
diver would in taking a fancy plunge Into
the water, an unknown man committed
suicide this morning at the foundry works
of the H. C. Frick CokÂ« Company by
diving into a coke oven.
For an instant the body clogged the
trunnel head and the legs wriggled as
though a desperate effort was being made
to squirm through and meet death quickly
in the blazing oven pit. A rush was made
for the oven pit by the horrified oven
drawers. All there was to show of thÂ«
man who but a few seconds before had
been in life waa a charred mass of flesh
not three feet in length. There is noth
ing about it that could be used as a
means of identification. It will be burled
to-morrow.

SAYS WARDNER
PRISONERS WERE
WELL TREATED
General Merriam Was Solic
itous of the Men Placed
in the "Bull Pen."
Testimony Given at Inquiry by Bart
lett Sinclair, Who Was Special
Representative of Gov
ernor Steunenberg.
WASHINGTON. April 23.â At the Coeur
d'Aleno investjgation to-day hopes were
expressed that the inquiry would be
brought, to a close within the next ten
days or two weeks. It has now proceeded
nearly two months.
Bartlett Sinclair, who, as the represen
tative of Governor Steunenberg, was in
chief authority in the Coeur d'Alenes, tes
tified to-day that he did not seek the task
assigned him by the Governor, as he
knew the man who undertook it risked
his life. He said he had been in entire
sympathy with labor movements and
while in New York had supported Henry
George in his campaign for Mayor. Gov
ernor Steunenberg, he eald, was in the
hospital when he received telegrams in
dicating the coming danger in the Coeur
d'Alenes. The Governor sought Sinclair
and finally delegated him to go to the
ecene of tha trouble and take charge of
matters, reporting- information for the
guidance of the Governor. Sinclair left
on the day the mill was blown up.
The witness said Governor Steunenberg
instructed him to be very careful, to take
no action against labor organizations as
such, but to direct his efforts to prevent
ing disorder and riot. When hÂ« took
charge he discovered that an armed and
masked mob had dynamited the Bunker
Hill mill, and that a reign of terror ex
isted, a/ though the country had been
racked by an army. There were two dis
tinct and recognised elemeot*. he said,
"the dynamiters" and the "Law and Or
der" element, and the neutral class out-
Fide of these two counted for nothing. Ho
saw groups of armed men, one of them
fifteen in number. It was impossible, he
paid, to eet in operation the courts or the
local offices. Accordingly, on hiÂ« recom
mendation. Governor Steunenberg de
clared martial law. State deputies were
appointed and ordered to arrest those sus
pected of participating in the disorder.
General Merriam furnished a military
guard and an old warehouse, known as
the "bull pen." was temporarily used for
the detention of the prisoners.
The witness said General Merriam was
quite solicitous as to the welfare of the
prisoners, visiting them frequently, and
that on his request he (Sinclair) had an
other prison built. He said the other
United States officers and the soldiers
showed the same kindly feeling to the
prisoners, so much so that there was
some criticism of the fraternizing of the
soldiers and the prisoners. The perma
nent prison, he said, was as good as any
in the country.

deavoring to escape in a wagon when the
vehicle fell through a broken bridge.
MOBILE, Ala.. April 23.â The flood sit
uation around Mobile shows a more des
perate condition to-day and every hour
the loss is growing greater. The Louis
ville and Nashville Railroad, which has
heretofore been free from any damage
and has been hauling the freight aryl pas
sengers of the Illinois Central and Mobile
and Ohio railroads for the past six days,
is now a sufferer also; the bridge over
West Pascagoula River, four miles from

rains continue throughout the flood dis
tricts of the South and the danger to lives

district is roughly bounded by a line
drawn from Mobile up the Tomblgbe*

He sent in reply an autograph letter in
which he promised, should be visit Chi
cago, he would gladly avail himself of
the opportunity to accept the Invitation.
On the strength of this letter the "dance
promoter" advertises the presence of the
admiral and his wife. The Chatfield-Tay
lor people have no objection to the ad
miral's being the guest of the Naval Vet
erans, but say the veterans, through
financial needs, have become the victims
of a money-making scheme, on the part of
the "danc**promoter.'" The Chatfield-Tay
lor committee does not believe Admiral
and Mrs. Dewey should be put upon ex
hibition hefore the mntley throng that
will be attracted to the First Regiment
Armory at Jl per head.

check appeared as the manager of an oil

given. He has given a different name to
himself each tim* and has nlxo changed

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, April 23.
Corlnne Metcalf, daughter of Congress
man and Mrs. Victor H. Metcalf, died at
9 o'clock to-night at the residence of the
child's grandmother, Mrs. Emily B. Xlch
olson. 1321 Linden street. The little girl
was 10 years of age. For ten days her
condition had been critical, typhoid fever
having set in and then spinal meningitis.
The father and mother, who were In
Washington when the child was taken
sick, were summoned home as soon as her
condition seemed serious. She had been
left here when they went East, as It was
believed that she .would be better off at
home than in a hotel at the national capi
tal.
Mrs. Metcalf returned home a week ago
and Congressman Metcalf arrived a day
later, In time to see his only daughter
before life had fled. For five days the lit
tle girl has been in a comatose condition,
and the attending phyÂ»lcians were unable
to do anything more than to barely keep
the spark of life flickering-.
The blow is a severe one to the family.
The child was a great favorite. She was
of a bright and happy disposition and
charmed all with whom she came in con
tact. Her illness has been a great strain
upon her parents, who have been con
stantly at her bedside watching the spark
of life grow fainter and fainter to the end.

STRATTON*B arraignment of the \
Aiz-J) preachers cf Oakland upon a j
charpe of religious intolerance has ;
cr.t!s-e<l a lively bttzzlr.g in the theological
beehive. Whiln Senator Stratton failed to i
<les?pnate by name any of The clergymen '
srhose rtc*Ul utterances had given him
the text for his pointed address last even
irg at the First Unitarian Church, events
ir Oakland pulpits of late have be*n given
Mich wide publicity that there has bfen
no difficulty in church circles In discover
ir./r The conditions which led to the emi
r.-.r.i attorney's remarks.
The question whether religious Intoler-
Btjce exist? among the leaders of church
thought in this city has been made th*>
?:oynote to th<? discussion which has been
Â« iv k<vj by Senator i^tratton's address.
Amor.p the clergymon who were much
i-'TCFifd in the publifhed reports Is Rev.
12. It. Dille. paftor of :he First Methodist
Church. Dr. Dille disclaims any title to
being one of '"the thrre trading minister?
of Oakland,^ to whom Senator Btratton |
makes refererce. The clergyman, how- i
cvtr. tnkc? strong !fÂ«u" with t!ie lecturer ;
upon the assertion that religious Ir.tokr- j
snef d->es exist among the leaders of re- j
Ifgious thought in this city. He contends i
that Senator Strftttor, has a misconception j
of the fituation.
"If Senator StrattÂ«n. who is my warm j
personal friÂ«>nd. did refer to me or to any j
â¢ f my rerept utterances,*' s^id Dr. nni*. ,
"he muyt hav<* had in mir.d my public j
Ftatemerts relative to Rev. Mr. Mills, who
(,iÃf hÂ«re amors those with whom he i
) ;.â¢*. formerly h^en affl'.lated and hurled de- ,
fnnce at the evangelical churches. This. ;
100. before he became ihe minister of the j
church he now occupies.
'"Senator Stratton has said: I find
that the leader? of religious thought here ;
vmrf scantily nrtmit the right of others to !
differ upon theological questions, diselopp â¢
rÂ«ry little charity and certair.'y no love |
for enÂ«Â» who has chanced his doctrinal be- Â¦
lief.'
"I take it thÂ»t thisapplfes to my criticism ,
of Mr. Mil!?' own statements that he did (
riot hrtlere the rrancelicÂ«l doctrines he i
preached when he was her* in full out- .
: *3r<3 svmrathy â¢with our work. I never
criticized Mr. Mills on hi? char.r- of ;
vl aÂ«. bv.t n* he rntrofluced himself here j
In a lnriÃ- public statpmcr.t that was a tl-
FQde against the churches and aguinst the
ministers of evangelical faith 1 showed
him up in an address. I proved by the
'deadly parallel" that he preached certain
doctrines in a most positive manner at a
time when, he now says, he had ceased to
believe them. He did not attempt to make
a reply.
"Mr. Mills or any other man can box
the whole theological compass, if he
pleases, ami I will never say hjrn nay.
Hut it is no Intolerance tÂ«j expop<> ro-
Hslous fraud. Mr. Mills said he did not
believe what he had prrachfd. Who Is
now to ?ity that he has n<4 the whole
Westminster Confession up his sleeve?
â¢ If Mr. Mills was criticized along thnpp
lines. hf> hap only hiui^'-lf to thank, for
he madf an unwarranted attack upon
the churches with which he had so close
ly fmternized.
"That is not religious intolerance. I
remembered of no other Unitarian c^r-
Kyman here who could complain of crit
icism. We can get along well enough
fn lor.? af we do not have to upset such
declarations as have come from Atr.
Mills.
"ThÂ» churc^f? arf> dwelling In harmony
and unity, and I can pee no signs of
rivalry which would prompt purh a view
a? ha? been expressed in the address.
.No 'odium throlopicum' exists here.
"I make th^se remarks upon the as
sumption that Senator Stratton found my
attitude to\>-nr<l Mr. Mills one of the
groun.is fnr his criticism. That Inference
can falrlv be drawn from his address.
"In connection with Mr. Mills' advent
Â».- a T'nitarian clej-g-yman several inci
dents occurred which, were of interest In
church circle?. Ho had mnde ft wonder
ful impression here a few years ago as
an evangelical revivalist. For that rea-
Fon his utterances In his new rield of
labor had additional interest to his for
mrr fellow-preachers In the orthodox
faith."
Rev. Robert F. foyle. pastor of thf>
First Presbyterian Church, recently
preached a series of sÂ«>rnirins upon ev&n
ppl'calism which created comment In the
face of the appe.nrance of Mr. Mills a?
a I'nitari.in. Th* trustÂ«f>s of the First
Congregational Church declined to per
mit the life of that auditorium for a
lecture to he sriveji by Mr. Mills. These
circumstance*, coupled with Dr. DilTe's
stand, are taken to be the. bay's In a
great measure for Senator Stratton's ut
t#rÂ«nrM.

firm of Wainwright & Easton.

Not Secure.
The racecourse and its snares, the fatal
fascination of the track and the rascality
of its gamblers have claimed another vic
tim. The collapse of the California Pack

president, seemed complete yesterday
when the creditors of the corporation filed
a petition in the United States District
Court asking that the Involved concern
be declared a bankrupt. It will be re
membered that the creditors agreed to
meet with Cote and discuss his affairs,
promising at the same time to permit him
to continue in business If conditions war
ranted such a course.
The action taken by the creditors yes
terday Indicates that they did not care to
take the risk.
In their petition to have the corporation
declared a bankrupt the creditors claim
that the following sums are due them:
Pacific Vinegar and Pickle Works. $2-1,000;
Abrahamson, Heinlsch & Co., $12,000, ana
\V. Grutzmacher. $256 77. The story of
the financial difficulties of the California

MRS. COBB GETS
A DIVORCE WITH
SMALL ALIMONY
Judge Fitzgerald of Los An
geles Believes Tale of
Plaintiff.
Husband Must J?ay Thirty-Five Dol
lars Every Month Because He
Was Not Kind to His
Wife.
Harry D. â¢M, Cobb and JosopWno L.
Cobb are no longer man and wife. A. de
cision nanCeO down yesterday by Judge
W. .P. Fitzgerald of Los Angeles, who is
sitting In Judge Hebbard's court in the
temporary absence of the latter, ig to the
effect that the -wife's complaint was well
founded and proved by the testimony. But
that is not a source of -worry to the erst
while defendant. Were it not for an or
der accompanylnp the decree of divorce
directing him to pay $33 a. month alimony
to Mrs. Ccbb he might still be measurably
happy.
Airs. Cobb alleped In her complaint that
her husband wss cruel and considerate
only of his own comfort. The decision in
part follows:
I would have been very n\a<\ Indeed if they
ten>, so that- they could ko together and live
together as husband and wife should live;
hut If they cannot live as a husband and -wife
should live, they ought not to live together.
I was In hop^s that for her knowledge of him.
notwithstanding hi!" brutal and inhuman con
duct toward her, that she might have suffl
clf-nt confidence In his promises to try and live
with htm aftain and live as a husband and wife
should live. She knows him a great deal bet
ter than I know him or any one else. They
have talked thla matter over thoroughly, and I
used my offices In a kindly way to brim? about
a settlement of the matter. If it could be done.
After all of this she has reached the conclusion
that phÂ» docK not want to live with him again.
and I nupnose that Is based solely upon the
Idea that fhe has not any confidence In his
liromlfles In that respectâ and I don't know
that she coultl be blamed for that. I don't
think that any woman ouÃht lo be compelledâ
and I do not believe any woman ought to live
with any man who would lay his hands upon
her in any other way save in a kindly manner.
Such belnfr the case. I shall grant a divorce to
the plaintiff upon the grounds stated In the
complaint, and you will prepare, Mr. Heney,
your decree accordingly. I also order perma
nent alimony of $35 per month. -.-' â¢Â¦:.* Â¦.-

General Barnes Announces That He Is
Not an Aspirant for Presidency
of the California League
of Clubs.
Colonel George Stone, president of the
National League of Republican Clubs, left
the city yesterday for Los Angeles. He
Is also president of the California League
and will, therefore, preside at the State
Convention of clubs.
One of the morning papers mentions
the name of General Barnes, among oth
ers, as a probable candidate for president
of the State League against Colonel Stone.
General Barnes has been elected a dele
gate at large to the State convention by
the National Republican League of San
Francisco, and deleÃatc by the Continen
tal League of this city and the Republi
can Alliance of Oakland, of which last
the general has been an honorary mem
ber for a number of years. He has an
nounced to each club his inability to be
present at the convention and declares In
most positive terms that he is not and
will not bo a candidate for any office
within its gift, least of all against Colonel
.Stone, whose candidacy he favors.
D. E. McKlnlay of Sonoma County is
in the city. He reports that the Republi
cans of the Second Congressional District
are organizing clubs throughout the dis
trict and getting ready to make an effect
ive campaign. Mr. McKinlay, at the sug
gestion of the Republican National Com
mittee, visited several of the leading cities
in the district and the public meetings
which he addressed wer& largely attended.
The contest for the Republican Congres
sional nomination in the First District
promises to be highly Interesting. D. E.
McKinlay has entered the field as a can
didate. He expects to win the Sonoma
delegation In the August primary election
for delegates to the nominating conven
tion. ?
District Attorney Webber Js also a can
didate to succeed John A. Barham. He Is
organizing Webber clubs throughout So
noma County and expects to extend his
scheme of organization to Napa County.
The counties of Del Norte, Sisklyou, Mo
doc. Humboldt. Trinity, Shasta. Lassen.
Tehama, Plumas. Sierra, Mendocino. So
noma. Napa and Marin comprise the First
Congressional District. The known Repub
lican candidates in the field are: State
Senator J? N. Gillette of Humboldt. T. L.
Carothers of Mendocino. D. E. McKinlay
and District Attorney Webber of Sonoma
and United States District Attorney
Frank L. Coombs of TTkiah.
Political gossip in the First District is
to the effect that W. F. Herrln Is lending
his support to the aspirations of Frank
Coombs, but the influence of the Southern
Pacific in the district Is not great enough
to excite the fears of Coombs' competi
tors.
It Is said that Daniel Kevane. secretary
of the State Board of Examiners, is ready
to lend a helping hand to District Attor
ney "Webber, but the rivals of Webber ex
pect that Governor Gage will suggest to
Secretary Kevane a policy of non-lnter
feronce. The Governor arrived In San
Francisco yesterday and will probably re
main several days to look after affairs
connected with the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners.

NEW RAID OF THE
RACING GAMBLERS
THE raid of Eastern track gamblers upon the people of San Francisco
continues with uninterrupted evil success. Almost every day the record
of wrecked lives and homes is increased. New chapters are being added
to the terrible story of shame and crime, disgrace, dishonor and death
which is being written for the people of this city by the blackleg schemers
of the racecourse. More young men are being ruined by the criminal arts of
the track followers. The jails and courts are receiving new crime-stained dupe*
and the Morgue slabs are supporting new- victims. More men are being lost
to honor and more women to shame, and in the face of it all are murmurs, in
credible ;is they may seem, that the Board of Supervisors intends not only
to tolerate the evil, gigantic in its menace, hut to encourage it by positive
and favorable JÂ«>Â£-:sla.tion. If this outrage upon San FYancisco be contem
plated let the Supervisors perpetrate it without pretense of disguise. Let
them picture their action as the people of San Francisco understand it and
in justice to the common sense of the peopie to whom they speak let them
discuss the racetrack evil as it is. If they contemplate any measure favor
ble to the Eastern blacklegs and their methods let their action be prefaced
by resolutions something like these which follow.
At the nK'Piirp of the Board of Supervisors yesterday Charles "Wesley
Reed, speaking for the Police Committee, reported that the committee, of
which h<? is a. member, could not reach an agreement upon ,-i proposed gam
bling ordinance. Reed was then instructed to draft an ordinance and pre
sent it to the bnard at its next meeting. The Call submits the following pre
amble and resolution and suggests it for the consideration of the .Police
Committee:
Whereas, The evil of race track gambling has inflicted upon
this city suffering-, crime ana death. The records of the courts, jails
and morgue tell the story of lives wrecked, dishonored and lost
through the manipulations of the licensed scoundrels, thieves and
malefactors trho infest the city and through the race tracks prey
upon the people of this city; and,
"Whereas, The Evil, -which has sent men of official station into
the penitentiary or the grave, has ruined men respected in private
life and has left its trail in homes despoiled and shattered, is no-w
on the increase rather than on the decline; and
Whereas, The press and pulpit, public men and private citi
zens, societies and organizations having the welfare of the city at
hesrt. have united in indignant protest against the existence of the
evil, it still thrives and grows greater in baneful influence with
each day. And the sad record of women's shame and of men's dis
honor is daily being completed by .the rascals who thrive upon the
weakness or ignorance of their victims; and .
Whereas, The people of this city, bslieving- in our integrity
and honesty of purpose, relying upon our ability to approach and
gOlve problems "Which affect the public -welfare, and trusting in our
manhood to legislate for that -which is g-ood, not evil, have elected us
a Board of Supervisors and endowed us with power and authority
to g-uard public interests; therefore, be it â¢
Resolved. That we, the Board of Supervisors, recognizing the
appalling effects of racetrack gambling upon this community, hav
ing full knowledge of the moral disease it carries in its train, know
ing from experience and association of the crime, misery, shame
and death it has worked upon the city, believe that gambling is in
the highest measure beneficial to racetracks, that racetracks are
good for San Francisco and deserve our heartiest indorssment and
immediately to carry out the provisions
cf the order. Trie resorutlon was adopt
ed. In addition he tacked a section to his
resolution which reads:
Evr-ry person, firm or corporation engaged in
â¢sujTlJ'ins water or gas or electric lights or
eiecincal power or perlorming or rendering any
telejihunic or electrical sktvicc to cr for the in
habitants of this city mid county shall pay
on their aggrtKate saies or receipts a license
as follows: Fur sales or r*ceii,ts of $5"Â»UÂ«X( per
ouartrr, f2-",l Â»*r quarter: f 3'Â». (ito. HSI iÂ«?r
Quarter; IS*/1" " . IWJ |"r quarter; |125,000, ?Â«6
jjt-r quarter; $7i.(Â«>o, ill per quarter.
"When McCarthy moved the adoption of
the resolution Brandenstein thought that
It should be referred to the License Com
mittee. McCarthy hold that the ordinance
'was a. law and should be enforced. To a
question McCarthy replied that the tele
phone company was the only one that had
paid the license on Us business, but it had
never paid cne cent on the telephone
nickel ooxes. which the order was espe
cially designed to reach.
The discussion evidently imbued the Su
pervisors with the stron.qr idea that the
telephone monopoly had long been enjoy
ing enormous privileges for which it was
not paying sufficient return to the city.
The order licensing telephones which
failed to pass the board at the last meet
ing was laid over for two weeks. Chief
Electrician Hewitt and Chlt-f Knginecr
â¢irunsky were authorized to make a de
talled inspection of the telephone com
pany's plant in oroer to determine
whether it is practicable. Hewitt ad
dressed the board and said that the sys
tem of securing the reFjmnse of the num
ber or party called for before the nickel
is deposited could be put in vogue, but he
<i!d not know how many extra operators
it would take. He would require two
Â¦weeks to investigate.
Hotalinp; presented an order repealing
the one now b<>ing enforced by the Police
Commissioner? relating to the prohibition
of partitions over six feet high in back
rooms of saloons. Hotalinp said that he
was mined to this course oy the system
of persecution to which the saloonkeepers
had been subjected by the commission,
which, he claimed, allowed no discretion
In the carrying out of the law. He oon
ttnded that the rigid enforcement of the
order would entail a hardship and ex
pense on mtn who ha<J many thousands of
dollars invented in the liquor business. He
expressed the hope that the obnoxious
order would be repealed. The matter was
referred to the Judiciary Committee.
Hotalinf? then Introduced a second reso
lution providing that the Chief of Police
Im* Instructed to refrain from carrying out
the provisions of tbfl present order until
final action on his repeal order had been
taken. ComtÂ« objected to this. Fayinp that
the board had no power to instruct the po
lice' to disregard orders which had been
regularly passed. A motion to refer both
orders to the Police Committee v.-as op
posed by Tobiri. who claimed that the
order now in force was a proper police
regulation. McCarthy held that the French
restaurant? were notorious offenders of
the law in that ro.=pc-ct. and apked for
leniency in the cape of the saloonkeepers.
Both of Hotalinjr's orders were then re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee.
When Jennings" resolution approving
the Flection of a design for a municipal
flag came up it did not go throuph with
out some opposition. Reed said that he
wan opposed to the Idea and moved that
it be referred to a committee. Branden-

certain obstructions on the street? and side

of Public Works alone has power to grant such
permits.
The City Attorney advised the board that the
turn of 515. UA 41 as principal and JTIS 60 as nc

The Board of Works submitted a report
recommending the course to pursue to preserve
Telegraph Hill from destruction. The board
advises that the most practicable method In
volves the establishment of one or more streets
located upon light grades and fitted to the
topography of the hill. Several such streets
starting from advantageous points and reach
ing the Bumrolt upon grades from 5 to G per
cent are possible. The easterly face of the
hill can be treated so as to give permanent
Mopes and permit of grading property on the
east base.
The AFBespor submitted a suggestion that
the board offer a rebate on the proportion due
on the city's part for delinquent taxes on ac
count of property Â«old to the State, which
will amount to one or two hundred thousand
dollar?. The State Controller has already com
menced action In several counties to get a

taken the right of redemption expires.
