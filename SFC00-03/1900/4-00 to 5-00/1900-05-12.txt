The weather durirg the week has been
rather disagreeable, due to cold winds and
frequent showers. If the weather prophet
in New York City is correct we will have
southerly winds to-morrow. This means
that the sprinters will have the wind at

PRINCETON', N. J.. May 11.â While
the seniors of Princeton College
are chanting their college songs
on the steps of Old Nassau Cali
. fornia's sturdy athletes are snugly
tucked in their beds dreaming of
beating the Princeton sprinters. More
than once will each California man run
his race in his slumbers, because their one
thought throughout the week has been
that they will not again suffer defeat at
the hands of the Eastern collegians. The
boys are in much better condition than
they were a week ago and will give the
Princeton men a harder run than they
did the Yale men. The Tigers, like the
followers of Ell. are strong in distance
and sprints, while we rely on our men in
the field events to win the day for us.
The Princetonlans are not so confident of
winning- as was 4 Yale.
The field day will be held in the morn
ing and a ball game between Princeton
and Georgetown in the afternoon. Prince
ton arranged matters in this way because
they wanted Hutchlnson, their hurdler,
who is also center fielder on the ball team,
fresh for the field day. Jarvls. their,
sprinter, said that he would be compelled
to run in both the 100 and 220 yard dashes
'to win 1 the day.
Captain Cregan of Princeton made the
following statement this evening:
"All of my men are in the very best con
dition and I think our chance for winning
is an even one. The way I reckon is that
we will win all the runs and the high
Jump. Then, if we Â¦win one of the hurdles,
we will win the \ day." â¢
Captain Drum of California made the
following statement:
"It is a doubtful proposition and looks
rather dubious for California. We ought
to win all the field events except the high
jump. We have a good chance in both
hurdles and a fighting chance In the quar
ter. .We will be doing well if we tie them
to-morrow."

WASHINGTON. May 11.â The House to
day broke 'all records, passing 180 private
pension bills. Among them was the Sen
ate bill to pension the widow of the late

per month. This amount was reduced by
the House to *50y At 4:45 p. m. the House
adjourned until Monday.
Pension Bills in the House.
WASHINGTON, May 11.â No dis
position has been made as yet of
the naval appropriation bill by
the Senate, but after an all-day
discussion an agreement was
reached to vote on the armor-plate sec
tion at 3 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
During to-day's discussion a notable
pppÂ«Â»ch was delivered by Lodge of Massa
chusetts upon the necessity of building up
the United States navy without delay. The
speech was delivered with the vigor and
Â«>am'-!=tness characteristic of Lodge's dis
cussion of public questions and attracted
much attention.
Dank-1 of Virginia presented an extend
ed argument in support of the immediate
construction by the Government of an
armor factory, while Allison of Iowa ap
posed the project of a Government armor
factory on the score of economy.
Speaking in opposition to the amend
ment, Lodge said that for the past three
yoars the Senators from South Carolina
and JCew Hampshire (Tillman and
Chandler) had been endeavoring to get
armor plate at a low price. The net result
cf their work had been to put a stop to
the construction of a navy. The amend
ment of Tillman. he paid, would absolute
ly stop the building of ships. He had no
prejudice against a Government armor
plart. In<3f-ed. he was not at all assured
that it wou!d not have been better in the
beginning of the construction of our navy
to erect an armor plant. To stop the
building of all ships until the armor plant
could be f-rrcted would, he thought, be a
fatal mistake.
Continuing. Lod^e said:
My reaxAr.s for <5es!r!nc more ships, and
Â«e*!rlnr them quickly. Is my be-lief that
the safety of the Vnltod States depends upon
the BtrenRth'rf our navy. Our Atlantic coaet

ern Maine. For thÂ» defer.je of this great coast
line ajid then* cities we have no ad'tquate fleet.
Vi> are about to enter upon the construction
of an isthmian ra n5 j. Whether it will be bet
ter to fortify the canal or not is yet an open
question. But to control that canal, to defend
tt. to hold It open for our commerce and for
the commerce of tho world, even though It be
realnst an enemy's fleet, we mun be the naval
Tr.asim of the Caribbean Bea. We must have
a far more powerful fleet than tve have to
day. The eafety of the car.al depends upon our
fleet. All admit that the canal ought to be
bu!Jt and time is near when the work will be
l^g-un. If we are to protect the canal, as well
as our own cooet, we muet ha%e a nary pro
portionately etronc.
I hnpe and believe that we shall have no
war, but a. *reat fleet is the greatest Insurance
of peace. However, we. would be foolish, ln
fieed. if we should close our eyes to the possi
bility of the situation. VÂ»> could never allow

t the Danish Islands to pass into any other
hands than ours. The European nation which
should undertake to take possession of those
Islands right on the road to the canal and
make them fcreat naval stations would by that
very act become an enemy of ours. W> could
submit to no such thins as that. The Monroe
doctrine Is a great protection to the United
States. Men of all parties â Democrats. Repub
licans and Populists â without distinction, ad
here to that. I am by no means sure that
some European nation (perhaps ! one whose
navy.is now receiving: euch rapid increase) may
not test the Monroe doctrine.
We may be called upon to protect that doc
trine In Brazil or in some other South American
country. I am not conjuring up fancies, but I
believe the way to preserve peace is to have
such a navy as no power in the world would
Lodge did not think there- was anybody
who did not believe in the construction
of a navy powerful enough to defend our
coast line and the Monroe doctrine. He
urged that no further obstacle should be
placed in the way of the navy's construc
tion.
In a colloquy with Lodge Tlllman said
it was well known that the navy of the
United States was superior, to that of Ger
many.
Iyodge, agreeing in part with Tillman's
statement, pointed to the great increase
that was now being made in the German
navy.
"If the Senator thinks," s*id Lodge,
"there is no danger to be apprehended, I
fear he underrates the importance of the
subject, a subject to which I have given
much thought and consideration."
Bacon of Georgia and Daniel of Virginia
favored a Government armor plate and
Elkins of West Virginia and Allison op
posed It.
Penrose of Pennsylvania offered an
amendment authorizing the Secretary of
the Navy to procure the best quality of
armor for the battleships Maine, Ohio and
Missouri at $545 a ton, including royalty.
He argued against a Government plant,
baying it would lie idle much of the time
and would be Immensely expensive.
It was agreed that fjebate on the armor
plate matter should cease at 3 o'clock to
morrow and that all amendments to the
committee's proposition should then be
voted upon. The Senate at 5:40 p. m. ad
journed.
The crowd showed its first enthusiasm
over the announcement that Charley
White would referee the fight. There was
a roar of applause when he entered the
ring. There was a brief wrangle over the
bandages on Corbett's hands, but he was
finally allowed to wear them. The gloves
were quickly slipped on and in a moment
the gong clanged out loud and clear. As
the men sprang forward the spectators
were stilled to silence that was broken
only by the rattle and clatter of the tel-
changed handshakes. Jeffries looked
brown, rugged and strong. He smiled an
occasional recognition to a friend in the
crowd, but for the most part seemed seri
ous. He looked burly in his blue sweater.
Corbett was clean, white and trim. He
said he weighed more "than on the day
memorable In pugili ;m when â¢ he â¢ defeated
Sullivan, but he did not look it; He was
in splendid condition.

In the preliminary sparring Corbett
showed to wonderful advantage/ He was
panther-like on his feet and darted in and
out with confusing speed: He .whipped
his left Into Jeffries' -face and was either
inside or away fj*Â»-,ii the punch*.... Jeffries
kept going in.r however, but he seemed
awkward. The pace made by the cham
pion was fast and there was a yell of sat
isfaction from the admiring spectators
when the gong ended the round.
Jeffries kept on making the pace when
they were at it again, but Corbett slipped
away from him. Jeffries would try his
left in a rush, but Corbett was almost in
variably away from it. It was a superb
exhibition and there were thunders of ap
plause that at times broadened Into
cheers. Corbett was out-boxing his man
and out-pointing him with his lefts to the
face. They were both fighting carefully,
for while ' Corbett had the speed and
cleverness he found Jeffries hard to get
to. Jeffries fought in his crouching at
titude, which proved so hard for Fitzsim
mons to solve.
Jeffries' Strength Tells.
Jeffries quickly began to" use his
strength and in the clinches threw a little
of his strength upon his opponent. Cor
bett showed surprising ability against him
and it was long before the strength of
the champion began to tell. "When Cor
bett had saved the ten-round money
there was a strong change in the senti
ment toward him. and the men who had
their money on Jeffries to win began to
be somewhat dubious. Jeffries was grim
and resolute and kept ' at his man. He
knew that up to that stage of the game
he had been outpointed and his only
chance was to rush in and mix it. Cor-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
XEW YORK. May 11.â I thought I would win sure. I was landing my
blows in good style and surely felt I would last twenty-five rounds and
get the decision. How I got the knock-out blow I don't know. I have no rec
ollection of it landing. It must have been a corker, however, to have put
me out. I have no excuses to offer for my defeat. I think I outpointed the
champion, and, had the bout gone the limit, would have got the decision.
But it's all over now. I got beat and I am done with fighting for a

bett kept his wits and strength and
avoided him.
To the man who loves strength and the
play of a giant athlete it was a splen
did picture. Here was youth and strength,
with a fair measure of skill, pitted
against the master of the sport. There
were cries that youth wonld win, but the
partisans of the man who possessed it had
their grave doubts. The pace was one
that would have told against any man not
perfectly prepared. By the seventeenth
round Jeffries, maddened by the danger of
marring his reputation, began a series of
desperate rushes in which he mixed it
fiercely with Corbett. He seemed angered I
by the jabbing at his face and wanted to
end it all with a swing from left or right.
Corbett had begun to show the pace, but
while his punches lacked force he was
still steady on his feet. He contented him
self with avoiding punishment. It became
simply a cuestion of how long that sort
of desperate game could be kept up.
At the twentieth round it looked as If
Corbett would stay the limit, and popu
lar judgment awarded him a victory. He
had up to that time avoided any serious
punishment. His face was unmarked
and the scratches on his shoulders and
arms were more the result of clinches
than blows. His defense was still per
fect and he was smiling and confident.
He either sidestepped from Jeffries' ter
rible rushes or ducked into clinches. Jef
fries was hammering away, however, and
was strong and game.
Cheers for the Conquered.
The end came with the suddenness of a
shock. The men had had two fierce ral
lies, followed each time by long range
sparring and were In together again.
They were both fighting fast and hard.
Suddenly there tvas a report of a sharp
blow and Corbett dropped. It needed no
count to tell that Corbett's hope for the
championship again was in vain. The ex
cited spectators sprang to their feet and
for a moment there were roars and calls.
The confusion was but momentary, how
ever, and in a silence' that was most re
markable, the fallen fighter was carried
to his corner. Some one called for cheers
for Jeffrie3, but the almost sullen crowd
refused to give them. Then, a moment
later, when a friend of Corbett put the
question a thousand re-echoed a kindly
response. It was in the corner of the de
feated man, too, that the crowd gath-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
JEFFRIES SURPRISED BY
HIS OPPONENT'S SHOWING
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NTETvT YORK. May 11.â Corbetfs work was a revelation to me. He never
fought better in his life. He was very fast and that may have made me
appear at a disadvantage; but I got the money, and that's the main thing.
They can all criticize my style of fightingâ say that I am a carthorse and
all that sort of thing â but nor.e of them I have met beat me, so I can't be
such a bad fighter. I knew Corbett was a clever fighter and recognized the
fact that I would have to land a knock-out. I looked for an opportunity to
get home that blow. It came in the twenty-third round and gave me the
fight.
I'll admit that my left hand is not so good as it used to be. Had Cor
bett employed the same tactics in his light against Fitzsimmons he would
never have lost the championship to Lanky Bob. He fought me with the idea
of staying the limit. He sprinted a lot and that made it hard for me to
reach him. JAMES J. JEFFRIES.
/-> EASIDE CLUB. Coney Island. N. i
I T.. May 11.â In the fastest, prettiest j
and closest heavyweight ring battle j
. i ever fought in New York, James J. j
*"*-^ Jeffries .has reaffirmed his right to I
the championship. In the arena of the j
.Seaside Sporting Club to-night he decis- j
lvely defeated James J. Corbett, once j
champion of the world himself, after ;
twenty-three rounds of scientific fighting, j
It was a clean knockout that came so
quickly that it dazed the thousands of
keen, alert, intent spectators and left
them in doubt as to just how the winning
blow was delivered. It Â¦was avowed that
Jt was a lefthand jolt to the Jaw, but
Jeffries himself and Referee Charles
"White, who stood at his side, say it was
a righthar.d swing.
There is credit for the victor and credit
for the vanquished In this cleverest of
ring battles. Jeffries must be awarded
the laurels of victory, yet his opponent
Is entitled to honor for his wonderful
fight. That feature of the contest stands
out Sn relief as the most striking one of
the battle.
Corbett emerged from a year's retire-
Taent from the ring rejuvenated and
fresh. He was fast and clever as back in
the days when people marveled at hip
ekill. His footwork was wonderful and
his defer.se perfect. He outboxed his
man et both long and short range, and.
It he had had the strength necessary,
would have gained an easy victory. A
hundred times he ducked under left
swings that would have ended him Just
as did the punch that knocked him out.
At times he made the massive Jim look
like a beginner in the art of offense and
defense with the hands. His strategy
was to Jab and get away. and. when Jef
fries Ftood over his quivering form, the
champion's face showed the marks of the
punishment the defeated man had In
flicted.
Crowd Was "With Corbett.
Corbett went down to a defeat that was
regretted by the vast majority of the men
who filled the hall. The money wfis
against him. but he had a wealth of sym
pathy. It was probably his natural herit
age as the short-ender before the battle
began, but he won more support by his
display of speed and skill.
Jeffries won with his strengthâ both that
strength that lies in the power of massive J
muscle, and that strength which is the
essence of vitality. He made the pace for
most of the distance anil at the end was
still strong and effective. At llrst glance
the battle may seem to detract a trifle
from his reputation, for It showed that
a fast man could reach him and get away
without a return. If that fighter of the
future- happens to be strong and rugged
in addition to being fast he will take the
honors from the man who to-night left
the ring, exultant in victory.
It Is improbable that there was ever a
more orderly affair under the Horton law.
There was order in the assembling and
handling- of the great crowd and order in
the contest. The small army of police
present was taskless and the contestants
themselves neither wrangled nor quar
reled throughout the evening.
The crowd gathered slowly. At 6 p. m.
scarcely 2000 persons entered the
arena. It was late before there was color
or life in the crowd. There was but little
betting on the outcome of the battle. In
the small sums played Jeffries was a clear
favorite at odds of two to one. These
odds veered at different times and differ
ent places during the evening, but five to
to two was probably the highest and five
to three the lowest offered. A favorite
bet was that Corbett would last ten
rounds, and the men who had a true line
on the former champion's condition reaped
well for their knowledge. There was de
cidedly more Jeffries than Corbett money
offered, but there never was at any time
any activity In the betting.

TECHNICAL ACCOUNT OF
THE FIGHT BY ROUNDS
Since then the next step in the deal has
been made and Mr., Grant has. secured the
control of Charles IL Smith's bonds.
These are but the first steps in the
transfer of the little railroad to the Santa
Fe system. The foreclosure proceedings,
the litigation a? .to the validity of the
various bond holdings and the several
different suits now pending will all have
to be settled before any final transfer
can be made, but the California & Ne
vada Railway Is now in a position to be
taken by the Santa Fe system whenever
that system deems that the proper time
for absorption has ccme.
Those who know the relations that ex
ist between A. A. Grant arid the Santa
Fe road know that the possession of the
California & Nevada Railway bonds by
Grant is equivalent to "their possession
by the Santa Fe Railway system itself.
Mr. Grant was the contractor who built
nearly all of the Atlantic & Pacific Rail
way and a large portion of the mileage
of the. Santa F k e system in Southern Cali
fornia. He is a man of large fortune and
influence in the railway world, and his
associations with the Santa Fc Railroad
are so close as to leave no doubt as to
what his possession of the California &
Nevada Railway bonds may mean. Mr.
Grant, -with true railroad forethought, de
nies that the Santa Fe has taken actual
possession of the California & Nevada
Railroad, but dees not deny that posses
sion can be taken whenever the settle
ment of the pending litigation and. other
circumstances warrant. Mr. Grant said
yesterday: . ; ,
"The California & Nevada Railway has
beep xo much talked about that even
the children ort. the streets of Oakland
discuss its value and its future. *It is un
doubtedly a valuable terminal property,
bu^ it has not yet been absorbed by the
Santa Fe Railroad Company. What might
happen. 1 cannot say. It Is true that I
have taken the position of receiver of the
road, but I do not think that that has
any special signification. I am not oper
ating the railroad and am doing nothing
but awaiting tho result of pending litiga
tion. It Is true that negotiations have been
pending with the Santa Fe Railroad, but
it is obvious that no conclusion can be
reached until the title to the road is set 1
tied. Nothing will be oi- Can be done until
the court renders Ita decision. That will
settle the exact question of title, and until
then no more can be done. There are
many things that may develop, and I am
not prophet enough to make predictions.
I think that the Santa Fe system can
get the road when It wants It."

something that is very necessary t<* the
Santa. Fe system, which has reached
within <-ig!-.t mites of Oakland.
Fifteen years ujro the * California and
Nevada Railway Company was incorpo
rated by pumc local capitalists to build
fr<Â«m Oakland into the Sonora and Bodie
mining district*. But a few miles of the
road vi ere constructed when Captain J.
W. Smith, a Denver capitalist of great
wealth, took an interest in the project,
i'aptain Smith paw the value of the road
as h f-rminus for an overland system and
undertook to construct a section of the
road, taking in payment tho bonds issued
by the company. In this way the road
was built to the town of San Pablo and
thÂ»<nee up the San Pablo Creek Canyon to
the litlle settlement of Orinda Park.
Hut the realization of Captain Smith's
dream? of pppculation was much slower
Jhan hf had anticipated. While the Cali
fornia and Nevada Railway had an excel-,
lent terminus, there were no buyers. For
a whUe Â«"aptain Smith operated the road
with a daily train in each direction, but as
The captain was obliged to supply the ope
rating expanses out of his own pocket.
Â«-ven this ceased in time and it became a
â¢tending joke that the California and Ne
vada Railway was but two streaks of rust
ua a right of ray.
Â¦ So the railroad that was to make the
California and Nevada its terminus never
came, and Captain Smith died in Oakland
awaiting the realization of his expecta
tions.
Captain J. W. Smith was succeeded in
the management of his estate by his son,
Charles H. Smith, and the son found the
sffairs of the California and Nevada in a
rery tangled condition. He found that F.
M. Smith, who has since secured control
Of nearly all of the Ptreet railways of
Oakland, had secured a lease of the prop
erty. Under this lease Mr. Smith had
operated the road for a short time, and
he had enlisted the support of the stock
holders of the road as against the' bonded
interests of the Smith estate. He found
also that th<* stockholders and directors
of the company had issued additional
lÂ»onds to thiÂ» extent of about $2W.000 for
**Â»rvlcÂ«*s which they claimed to have ren
ri'-red the railroad. All of this consti
tuted an additional lien upon the property
nnd rfducf-d thft value of the original
i'aptain Smith bonds.
ThfÂ» first move made by Charles H.
Fmith was to throm- his railroad Into the
*an<1s of '? a receiver. J To do this he
lirougM f&recloenre proceedings in the
court*. In. this, foreclosure suit
liÂ«? assorted the locality of only his bonds,
.amounting In number to three hundred.
Tr,* other two hundred and fifty bonds
/â¢laimed by the officers of. the company
iin<l the former lessee he asserted to be
jliegal and void in that they had been Is-
V'.i'-d without proper compensation being 1
made to the road. This di-ew the fire of
ihe holders of the bonds whose legality
W attacked. They replied In a counter
puit asking that all of the bonds, includ
ing th*>ir two hundred and fifty, be fore
closed upon the property, but Charles H.
â¬mlth secured the advantage and named
the receiver in the person of C. K. King
tsf Oakland, the former superintendent of
jh* road.
, For several years the little road has
been involved in this extensive litigation.
Vlany proceedings of many kinds have
been had smd.mucft bitterness has. been
engendered. Charpes of fraud neve been
freely mafle on both Â£ides and the docu
fnents in the various suits are filled with
allegations of fraud and illegal actions.
' It has been this Involved litigation that
has done much to injure the pale of the
road. Possible purchasers have been un
certain with which t-Ide to negotiate and
have never known whether they woulS
focure the road by the purchase of the
.Smith estate interests or whether they
would be compelled to recornire the ad
ditional two hundred and fifty bonds. The
trial of the foreclosure proceedings has
been had and the case has been submitted
to Commissioner Hracock of the Federal
r-ourt. and a decision Is expected at any
time.
As thesÂ« proceedings reached conclusion
A, A. Grant made his appearance upon
the fcene In an active capacity. Mr. Grant
was the holder of a very few bonds, the
validity of which were nev*>r questioned.
He threw his Influence with Charles H.
Smith and then the first Indication of th
<3eal which lias since been consummated
was isiven. Mr. Grant was appointed re

Undaunted, She Agrees to Wed.
He replied that the wife was what he
most needed. He vowed he would pay for
bringing out her books and do much for
her besides. He assured her that he was
confident that they understood each other
sufficiently for her to come to Hanford
under his first proposition to pay her way;
and added that they would make a fin
ished job of the business by marrying
at once If able to agree.
She wrote him that she would accept
his proposition to go to Hanford and enter
Into personal negotiations with him. She
arrived at Hanford in due course and was
identified by \ Page. He had promised she
should live at a hotel he owned in Han
ford during the time necessary to arrange
the preliminary details of the strange ne
gotiations. But to the ranch they went
to permit her to inspect the place. She
found the interior of the house dilapidated
and untidy in a degree to rival the ex
terior appearance and condition of its
owner.. But he excused both on the
ground that the influence of woman had
Been absent from the ranch so long that
everything, Including himself, had gone to
ruin and waste. He said he had thought
of renovating and cleaning up, but de
cided to leave all to the woman, who
would have her way about such matters
and do air he might do over again. She
saw ' enough in two minutes to disgust a
sensitive woman of refinement; but as 8he
was in for a mission of reform the worse

neglected, disordered house. He told her
she might repair and furnish to her own

1 pers and periodicals. Her literary tal
ents attracted the attention of a wealthy
family with which she went twice abroad
and became .mistress of several lan
guages. At length she returned to Cali
fornia, where she learned that her early
flame had died in a foreign land. She met
and married Frank M. Bushnell at River
side, the Rev. Charles Button perform
ing the ceremony^ *Her husband was of
a naturally good disposition and char
acter, but was Indolent and had no tact
as a provider for a home. She lived with
him ten years, she working at her trade
most of the time and thus making a liv
ing for herself and her husband, till her
health failed and she went to the hospi
tal for a long season. After this she
was unable to work and was finally
driven to seek a divorce from the husband
that made no effort to relieve, her dis
tress. When she regained partial strength
she again worked at her trade spasmod
ically in Los Angeles.
She was surprised one day when a let
ter came to her addressed to Miss Lillian
Leslie Bushnell, postmarked Hanford,
Cal. She opened and read the strange
statement that the writer had been seek
ing a suitable wife for some time. He
was an old man. He had been a preacher
for fifty years. He was well provided
with the goods of this world. He had a
home for a wife the remainder of his
days and would leave her a comfortable
Independence after his death. He wanted
a woman with a good education and re
finement, able to help him arrange his re
ligious literature for the "press," as his
own education was defective. He had
heard of her literary ability through a
man who had worked in . an office Â¦with
her In Los Angeles, and was satisfied she
was In every respect the woman he had
been so long vainly hunting.
She replied guardedly, telling him that
she would have to meet and know him
well before she could even think of con
sidering such a proposition. She told him
she was qualified to perform all he re
quired, but regarded the sacrifice she
would have to make out of all question
within the latitude of any compensation.
But she finally told him that if he wished
he could call on her In Los Angeles. He
quickly replied that he could not then go
to Los Angeles, but that he was so sure
that she would more than realize him hia
fondest anticipations he would pay her
expenses to Hanford and back to Los An

ment seemed fair enough, but could not

that she knew how to prepare matter

The Young Woman Appears.
Thus ho was baffled "and tantalized for
four years,- when he met and married
the young woman who is now the central
figure in this life storyâ Lillian Leslie.
Her family came to California when she
was a little girl â an unappreclative step
mother there crossing the threshold of
her father's home Just before she entered
her teens.
She was sent to school in Oakland some
terms, fell in love at fifteen, and was sent
secretly away to complete her education
with relatives in Massachusetts, so the
beau - never knew where she was to be
found, as she was not allowed to write
home and was denied even the price of a
postage stamp till long arter the man she
loved sold hia possessions in California
and sought refuge beyond the sea. .;.; After
some yearsjof school the family that held
her as a ward decided to go , Went 5 and
she refused to accompany those who had
been bo long her practical Jailers. She
then at once learned at her own volition
the compositor's trade and became a con
tributor of verso and â¢ prose to newspa-
Courted a Female Barber.
Page was lonely after the death of his
wife and pined for and went In quest of
female companionship. He soon found a
reciprocating woman by the name of
Catherine M. Adams, a barber- In Han
ford. apparently willing to heed the low
dulcet wooing of an old. repulsive man
with money. But the fair Catherine had
an eye to business. Samuel Page went
to Hanford one afternoon to wed and
bring her home to the ranch. She demand,
ed 12000 cash, deeds to some lots and a
house In town and the home ranch before
going to the altar. Page demurred, but
pledged his word to grant the demand at
once after the nuptials were sealed. This
was objected to and he returned home.
Two days later the woman sued him for
breach of promise, fixing the damage her
heart had sustained at $15,000,
He had talked so freely that there ap
peared to his attorneys a strong prob
ability that the woman would have ample
testimony to get a. big Judgment against
him.
He became alarmed and arranged with
his children, Dr. Solomon C. Page and
Mary Ann Garver, to make over his
property to them and thus put It beyond
the reach of law before the, suit of the
Adams woman could be tried. But the
transaction was made with the verbal un
derstanding that the title so conferred
was to be rendered back after the danger
of the pending suit was passed.
The suit of the Adams woman termi
nated with n judgment of J500 against
Page, which he satisfied and quickly de
manded the return of the fraudulent ti
tle to his property hold by his son and
daughter as stated. But he found that a
sad change had come over the spirit of
the dreams of his custodian children;
they had decided to retain the property,
to which they held unconditional titles.
Such perversity provoked Page to Â«"Uu his
children for the recovery of hi* estate.
Henry C. and Ellas C. Page entered the
legal arena arrayed against their brother
and sister, Solomon C. and Mary. Ann,
desperately resolved to' annul the trans
fer of their father's estate to them.
The cold comfort he met In his love
affair with the Adams woman, and tRe
trouble that that indiscretion involved
him with his children were not sufficient
to admonish him to desist from matrimo
nial adventure. He answered advertise
ments In matrimonial papers and corre
sponded with a number of women. But
he ever met demands ror advance cash
settlements .entirely repugnant to him.
of which reveals In mute eloquence the
grasping avarice of the late owner. The
house was never but half finished and
had but one coat of paint, and there is not
one ornamental shrub or flower about the
yard. Such garnishments would not pro
duce money, and hence were never allow
ed. The furniture Is scant and of the
style cf early pioneer times.
Page was born in 1S23 in Pennsylvania
of genuine Dutch stock and married
Nancy Coffman In 1S44. They came to
California and settled at Hanford about
twenty years ago. Samuel Page's wife I
died fifty-two years after their marriage, !
and he continued to live on the home
stead.
One who know him well and long says
of 'him: "He was never a kind nor highly
respected man in all his life. He was
grasping, miserly and shrewdly cunning.
He had a peculiar notion about the Bible,
not a religion, but ren >red its meanings
according to his understanding."
A ghastly chapter of the old man's fru
gality is well vouched for not only from
his own declarations, but Attorney Dixon
L. Phillips heard a witness who was pres
ent confirm it, and one of which it is said
he was especially proud. It ran in this
wise: He was absent from- home and re
ceived notice that his father was at the
point of death and he must come quickly
or be too late. He set out at once, but
found his father in his coffin when he ar
rived. It was just lunch time, and every
one was going cut of the presence of the
dead to eat a bite before starting to the
churchyard. He did not care to eat, but
preferred to remain the short time alone
with his father. It was the day of home
spun clothing. His father was dressed in
.the best that could be made. He deliber
ately unscrewed the lid of the coffin, took
his father out. stripped him of the good
new suit, put on an old one that was at
hand, returned him to the casket and
snugly stored the new suit away in his
grip, selling it for $10 when he returned
to the place where he lived.

AFTER THE HEAD OF
CHINESE REFORMER
P. I people of Sings County are
r deeply interested in the impend
ing contest over the will of
Samuel Page,' an eccentric old man
â¢who died near Hanford last year,
leaving an' estate valued at?100,000.
For four years prior to his death the
old fellow had been seeking a wife to
comfort him in his declining years.
He had advertised in matrimonial
publications, but failed to find his
ideal until after a - correspondenc*
with Lillian Leslie Bushnell, a beauti
ful young woman of Los Angeles pos
sessed of many accomplishments. Only
a short time before death summoned
the venerable rancher he married this
young woman â the second upon
whom he had bestowed the name
of Page. Page's children, against
whom he was greatly embittered
bicause of attempts to secure
possession of his property, accuse her
of being an adventuress. The widow
indignantly resents this and says
they are seeking to deprive her and
her posthumous child of every ves
tige of their inheritance and cast
them penniless upon the world. She
asserts that the machinations of the
children drove her husband to hope
less insanity and his grave. The tes
timony to be given at the cominjj
trial, the young -woman declares, will
be as sensational as any that has
ever been heard in the courts of
California.

Legal Conflict Between the Venerable Rancher's Children and the
Beautiful- Young Woman Who Married Him Shortly
Before He Became Insane and Died.
QUEER OLD SAMUEL PAGE'S
$100,000 ESTATE THE PRIZE
Property Declared a Trust.
Judge W. B. Wallace, before whom the
suit against Sol C. and Mary Ann was
tried at \isalla, decided as every feature
and purpose of the transfer of the prop
erty, the recovery of which was the ob
ject of the suit, was fraudulent, it would
have to stand; but he granted Samuel
Page a life estate in the home ranch and
declared the property a trust fer the four
children, the only heirs he deigned to rec
ognize. The widow appealed against the
decision, as It might be construed as ig
noring both her and her child. Winifred,
the posthumous heir of her husband, and
would undoubtedly deprive them of their
rights. The case is now pending on the
making up of a bill of exceptions.
The decision of Judge Wallace gave
Samuel Page a life 'estate in the home
ranch, which naturally became the right
of the widow and the babe at his death,
and which they partially enjoyed for a
â¢ little season. But the receiver soon for
bade her to sell or use anything on the
ranch, claiming that every piece of furni
ture was trust property; yet, Mrs. Page
declares, the same receiver has since
practically turned the ranch over to Ellas
C. Page, permitting him to appropriate
the property and charging him the value,
or claiming that he so charges what Is
thus taken, against his interest in the
estate. Mrs. Page further asserts that
Ellas C. Page came from Kansas and lived
on the ranch many months at her ex
pense, making her believe the while that
his gratitude and . appreciation were so
great that he should go to any extreme
to aid her In winning the legal fight
against Solomon C. Page and Mary Ann
Garver. He was anxious, she says. to. en
ter into an arrangement by which they
could manipulate matters so as to possess
all of his father's estate.- An Indignant
refusal resulted in- his leaving the ranch.
His departure, declares the widow, was
followed by an attempt on the part of the
receiver to deprive her of any means of
support from the ranch and to serve her
with an ejectment notice, the validitv of
which is now pending In court. Ellas
Page obtained from the receiver the per
mission to appropriate the products of the
ranch; and was actually hauling away
the last of the firewood and would have
removed every stick had she not harness
ed up a team in the night, hitched it to
his loaded wagon, drove to the house and
unloaded It in the yard by herself before
morning.
All the Kings County folk who are
friends of the young widow unhesitating
ly declare that she is paying doubly dear
for the reward of her sacrifices', not an
over munificent compensation had > it all
been realized and enjoyed in peace after
the life she experienced with Samuel
Page. The Page children, too. have many
friends who look unfavorably upon Mrs.
Page and are anxious to see her defeated
In the coming trial of the contest over the
will. S r ---
Mrs. -Page declares that a short time
before the old man passed away Sol
omon . C. Page had made an attempt
to send his father to an insane asy
lum and dispossess the widow of the home
ranch, on the ground that his father was
no longer responsible for his acts; that
the influence of an adventurers controlled
him absolutely and designed to disinherit
his children entirely. But the court denied
the unsustalned petition.
When Samuel Page sued his son and
daughter for the recovery of the prop
erty made over, to them when the suit of
the Adams woman was pending against
him he had a receiver of the estate ap
pointed in the person of J. O. Hickman.
Henry C. and .Ellas C. Page had joined
issue against their brother and sister, SoJ
pmon C. and Mary Ann, so that the fam
ily was fighting in three factions at the
time of his death before Lillian Leslie
Page ever became entangled among them,
iserore he became insane Samuel Page
became so exasperated at the conduct of
his children that he made a will in favor
of his wife as follows:
This my will to my widow all the law
allows and the fulfillment of the marriage
contract: all the personal property; $50 to
Sol. C. Page; $50 to Mary A. Garver and
the rest to my other natural heirs, and my
widow to administer without bond. This
in case I beat Mary and Sol, and get mv
money back; otherwise my widow is to
wfl al \} }^ t $5 to each ot mv children."
When it became certain that the end of
Samuel Page was near Sol C. and Mary
Ann were summoned to look their last at
their father in life. But the suit was on
trial at Vlsalla against them and they did
not put in an appearance. .; , Â¦â¢*?>;
Page held a mortgage on a quarter sec
tion of land adjoining the Cook mine in
Tulare County that was bonded last year
for $30,000. He made, some time before the
trouble growing out of the complications
the suit of the Adams woman created be
tween him and his children, a power of
attorney in favor of Solomon C. Page to
foreclose said mortgage. According to the
widow, the son obeyed the wishes of his
father in every particular except in the
ownership of the new possession, having
had the title drawn in his own favor in
stead of Samuel Page's. The day the
father learned this he became violently
insane and never recovered, but died a
month later broken-hearted and mad
dened at the loss of property, that prom
ised to become worth a million in a short
time, as gold had just been discovered on
the land.
He had never taken a bath in all his
life, and assured her that when he once
washed his feet he took such an awful
cold that it almost brought him to the
grave. But she gave him baths, to which
he had the choice of submitting or giving
her up. She was Samuel Page's wife and
had assumed the obligation of taking care
of him for the remainder of his life; so
she bit her lips, resolved to endure what
ever she was powerless to cure and stand
by the hard contract she had entered into.
But her experience was swift and fierce
but not tediously prolonged with the old
man and his miserly traits.

told him she required a doctor, which he
refused to provide, saying he was not
going to pay $3 a trip for a doctor to visit

could cure her as well himself. He delib

But this was not the most nor the worst

A REASON_FOR IT.
There Is Only One Pile Cure That Has
Beached a National Popularity
and Beputation.
There are many popular medicines ; that
are known In every household In America.
There are blood purifiers, nerve tonics,
headache remedies, dyspepsia cures, and
cough cures, which are pold in every drug
store In the nation and beyond.
But all of these must divide their pop-
ularity with many rivals, no one remedy
has the field to Itself, with the single
exception of pile cures, for it is a singular
fact that there Is but one pile cure that
can be considered as having a national
reputation, without a rival and the re-
ferred to is the Pyramid Pile Cure, which
for seven years has steadily worked Into
the public favor by reason of Its extraor-
dinary merit, until it is known from Maine
to California and from Manitoba to the
Gulf. â Â£
It is true there are many pile remedies
having a small local reputation for a year
or two, but ''.the-- Pyramid 'Pile Cure has
rapidly supplanted them all and really has
the field to Itself when anything like na-
tional popularity is considered.
The explanation Is simple. It Is because
piles is in no sense an imaginary trouble
that a bread pill or a simple salve or oint-
ment will cure, : but anfobstlnate, painful
and often dangerous trouble and a remedy
to give satisfaction must possess positive
rfnd very apparent merit. A person suffer- j
ing from piles will ; not experiment for
months with a remedy; it must give relief
anda cure in short order or it is con-
demned: ' :
% The worst cases of piles are relieved on
the . first' application of Â¦ the Pyramid and
a : cure will result in : a reasonable time
from" its regular use.:
Medicine men use . It In preference to
operations because i#is safer, is perfectly
?ainles3 and the cost to patient is a mere
rHle, as all druggists sell, the Pyramid
Pile Cure at 50c, and as It is used at night
it cures without interfering with regular
occupation. Â¦:Â¦:
v If - suffering Â¦â¢ from: any form : of pllea.
bleeding,* itching or protruding, a trial of
the : Pyramid - will cure you and add an-
nthar to ita thnusamla nf frienila. v

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND
Strengthens Muscle Tissues,
Invigorates the Nerves,
Makes Rich Blood.
0. T. Crump, Richmond, Va., writes:
"For several weeks before I commenced using Paine's Cel-
ery Compound I had a tired and all-gone feeling, my blood be-
came impure, and I was daily losing flesh. One of my friends ad-
vised me to use Paine's Celery Compound, and I found relief
from the first bottle. I used three more bottles, and it made my;
nerves strong, my blood pure, and muscles firm."
Paine's Celery Compound is a re-
source for health, strength, vitality.

The seventh semi-monthly -contests of

be held at Stow Lake. Golden Gate Park,
this afternoon and to-morrow-morning.
- F. 'H.: Reed " was on. the Upper Sacra
mento last Sunday. 1 He found the current
too strong for fly-fishing,' but caught some
trout with a spoon. :' Â¦ ; t .;
John Gallagher is stationed at- Baird's,
on the f McCioud, with ; Colonel ~ Kellhor.
He- has not had an opportunity, to do-mucn :
fishing yet.:* He has ordered nome. Â¦ special
lures from John Butler, which he will uao
while on the river. - ,
The unsettled condition of the weather
has retarded the fishing this season in a
marked degree. A number of recent trips
to well-known streams have resulted In
disappointment to some of the most ex
pert anglers. The water In the McCloud
Is still. high. It is claimed; the river will
not be at its best until June 1. The water
Is generally of crystal purity and the bed
of the river may eaBlly be seen. Now an
object six Inches below tho surface cannot
be discerned. The Sacramento was dis
colored from last week's rain, but It has
already cleared considerably. At Sims
many men fish the three- creeks In the
vicinity when the river Is not available.
The Truckee will be ready for the fish
ermen about June 1, although its present
appearance Indicates that it will pe a late
season there according to well Informed
anglers. The Yuba will be ready for the
trout fishermen about July 1. Â¦
At the recent dinner of the Fly-casting
Club Charles S. Wheeler called attention
to a peculiar fact regarding fishing. Each
year the rods and tackle are being made
finer, thus reducing their power to kill
game. In every other line of sport the
opposite tendency prevails. . Rifles ; and
shotguns are being made more destructive
year by yoar, with special powder and
bullets, making it less difficult to bring
down wild fowl and other creatures.
RAINS SPOILTHE FISHING.
Â¦ Strange as It may appear, the foregoing
table shows- that, though the Friscos are
at the tall end, they have won a majority
oÂ» the games which they have played
against the leaders. The two teams. have
played against each other five times this
season and the Friscos beat the cham
pions three times. Yet they have failed
to win a single game from the Dudes.

Modern golf clubs tend to approach
more and more "to the same type, there
not being so much difference In style and
appearance between the clubs of different
makers as there formerly was. Twenty
years ago' it was quite easy, without.ex
amining a club closely, to tell who made
it, all the leading makers manufacturing
clubs with special characteristics. For
gan, Morris, MacEwans and' Patricks,
clubs could be readily distinguished by
a golfer. Nowadays all the wooden 'clubs
are alike, the number of clubmakers has
largely increased, and machinery is used
in the manufacture. The heads of clubs
tend to become shorter and brpader, and,
[though not so graceful as the old' clubs,
are more effective. The modern club Is
ia harder and more scientific hitter than
r the -old one, and the head is made some
thing like that of a mallet, as an-fmple
ment of that sort has less contact with
the ground, more concentration of force
and greater accuracy.

cou'd still be bunched If those at the bot

DOG SHOW GLEANINGS.
That the selection of Judge Mortimer
for the dog show was a wise one is Indi
cated by the dearth of protests. Only one
has been lodged with the directors of the
San- Francisco Kennel Club, and that by
J. W. Flynn. against the win of Alec
Colvin's pointer. Lady C. In the field-trial
class. The ground of the protest s that
Lady C was not eligible to compete In
that class, she^ not having been placed n
any recognized field trial." Mr Colv n

tlon that, no, such restriction applies to
dogs that have competed In field triai<T
The premium 'list .reads simply "Field

been, both here and In the East to re
strict the eligibility to dogs which have
been placed In the trials. wnlcI * nave

the California Cricket Association "has
prepared a schedule of matches to be
played during the present season between
the Alameda, California and Pacific

by Edward Brown, president of the asso
ciation. A practice match was played last
Sunday on the grounds at Webster street,
Alameda. between two scratch elevens
one captained by R. B. Hogue and the
other by H. C. Casidy. The batting was
poor, the pitch being in a rough and un

-only 35 runs, of which John Myers made
11. Hogue's eleven were all out for 20. the
highest score being 7 by G. C. Lewis. Har

A committee consisting of Henry Ward,
George Theobald and the secretary of the
AFfociatioti met yesterday evening in the
office of the secretary to draft a reply to
the communication pent some time ago
by the Lake County clubs to the associa
tion. The reply will be t<ent to the clubs
ehortfy. and it is t-o be hoped that it may
have the good effect of retaining the
Burns Valley and IÂ«ikeport clubs in the
association and of inducing the Placer and
6hasta County clubs to resume their
membership. The cricketers around
Loomls and P^nryn are keen about the
pame and until, last year were always
strong supporters of the association. The
Mountain Copper Company Club in Shasta
County has been so much weakened by
the departure from Kepwick of H. N. Tru
man. T. W. G. Wallace and H. C. Casidy
that it Is hardly likely it will be able to
pet a team together this year.

Captain James Finds the
Water at "Belvedere Too
Cold for Polo.
The draft of a letter which the rowing
clubs intend to send to the officials of the 1
Southern Pacific Railroad regarding the |
laying out of a course across the bay was j
submitted to the members of the Alameda j
Boating Club at their regular meeting last
Tuesday night, and was approved. It i
wa? submitted to the Dolphins on Thurs
day night and met with their sanction.
When all the clubs have had an opportu
nity of passing 'upon it It will be sent to
the proper quarter. The Alameda Club
promises to take as many tickets for the
proposed regatta on Oakland Creek as it
has members and will do anything else
that It can to further the project. It was
decided to hold the second moonlight pa
rade and entertainment on June 16. The
junior barge crew is in good condition.
The Ariel Rowing Club meets regularly
once a month at 'Sii McAllister street. At
the meeting held last Monday evening the
Alameda boat-builder. Al Rogers, was
present and reported, that the club boats
are all ready. It was decided to hold a
eluh regatta early in June at Long
Bridge. There will be barge and out
ri&ge<l skiff races and other events. The
following committee has the regatta in
charRe: W. Howe. A. H. Brown, J. C.
Oeddes. George T. McOir.nis and H. Foley.
An important proposition was also laid
before the members. The club numbers
among its members many good swimmers
who desire to form an organization, to bo
called the Ariel Swimming Annex. A tem
porary organization has been effected and
officers elected. The proposal, which was
submitted by J. C. Geddes, was referred
to the board of directors, who will act
Upon it. If the annex is formed races will
be held off Long Wharf, which is said to
be one of the best straightaway swim
ming courses in the United States. As
some of the best swimmers on the Paolttc
Coast belong to the Ariel Club, the estab
lishment of the swimming annex would
add prestige to' the club and also
strengthen its membership. The Ariel
swimmers have been practicing for the
proposed water polo match on Olympic la
dies." day, but a communication has been
received from George James, in which he
states that the Olympic men consider tho
water at Belvedere too cold for a water
polo match. The event will probably be
called off. The Ariel Club has chartered
ICugene Flanders' launch Alert and an
other launch to convey members to Bel
vedere May 20.
The Pioneer j Rowing Club has so few
Juniors among its members that it has
not been able to get a crew to row at Bel
vedere. It will make one -or two. entries
In the junior outrigged skiff race. On the
second Sunday in June the second race
for the Alpers medal will be rowed and
on the same day the new barge will be
christened and Jinks held.
One of the most interesting events on
Olympic ladies* day will be the race In
outrigged eklffs between George Baker
and Stanley Adderley. ' The former won
the Junior outrigged skiff championship
by a larger margin, according to Dr. C.
C. Dennis, than did Stanley Adderley. He
is an athletic man, constantly In good
physical condition and trains faithfully.
Stanley Adderley, however, has his sup
porters, and on - a rough day may. beat
Baker. . -
It is Intended to mark out 'the course
on Belvedere Cove by buoys firmly at
tached to anchors, so that tney may not
drift ThÂ« distance will probably be meas
ured by taking a barge crew out at full
speed for four and a half minutes. The
turn will be at the point reached by the
crew.
The Tritons will appoint a nominating
committee at their next meeting to pre
pare a list of candidates for the various
offices. The election will take place in
June.

ROUNDING THE OUTER STAKEBOAT IN A CORINTHIAN CLUB REGATTA.
From a Photograph by F. J. Clute.
The spirited .=oene Illustrated herewith is a common one on San Francisco Bay during the sum
mer Foa.Â«on. Races are frequent and the 'amateur tars of the various clubs show skill and daring in
the handling of their boats. There is generally a strong wind blowing, but the tendency is to
crack on all sail po?sible. The boats are stoutly built for cruising and are invariably fitted with all
conveniences. The racing machine type, barren of comforts, has never developed here. Quick deci
sion and clever seamanship are often required of the yachtsmen. \
Captain L. Skbe of Shell Mound made a
liberal bid. while the offer of Captain F.
Sohuemann of Schuetzen Park was
thought by rome to be even more lib
eral. Each range and its owner had
friends and ihe lipht began. On Wednes
day Captain SchuÂ«-mann died and some
lnheved that event would throw the
tournament to Shell Mound, but the
Schuetzen Park partisans had no idea of
giving up the fight. The bitterness ha*
grown to such a. degree that several of
the clubs have threatened to withdraw if
the bund decided to go to Sohuetzen Park.
Two of these clubs, according to report,
are the San Francisco Schuetzen Ytrein.
one of the largest rifle organizations of
the West, and the N'orddeutscher Sohuet
zen Club. From ail accounts the Ger
mania Schuetzen Club is about in the
same position, while there is but little
doubt that the Columbia P.ifle and Pistol
Club officials take a similar stand. On
the other side stand such organizations
as the California Schuetzen C!*Jb. the San
Jo*e Rifle Club, the Sacramento Helvetia
Sohuetzen Club, tbe recently reorganized
Maxin County Rifle Club and the Golden
Gate Rifle and Pistol Club, which are
willing to abide by the decision of a ma
jority vote. Most of the latter are parti
sans of Schuetzen Park, but if the bund
goes to Shell mound there will be no boy
cotting done. The conservative element
on each side is disgusted with the man
ner of proceedings. Etating that if the
riflomen of the East learn there is so
much friction and lack of harmony on bo
email a Question as the selection of a
range they will not come West. This ele
ment characterizes such a condition of
pffalrs as a disgrace to the rifle fraterni
ty. The next meeting of the bund is to
be held in four weeks and possibly in the
meantime there will be tome change. Ac
cording to reports more than one of the
clubs will withdraw their delegates and
eend new ones to the next meeting.
The delegates to the XationaJ Schuet
â¢zer.bund are having a merry row among
themselves over the malter of selecting
a shootine range for the coming rifle tour
riament, which is to be held here in July
of next year. At the meeting of the bund
en Thursday evening at C20 Bush street
there was a heated discussion and Inci

The race has narrowed down this year
to three clubs, the Olympic and Hay City
of this city ar.d the Garden City of San
Jose. It takes an unusually .strong club
financially and ono with an abundance
of racing talent to enter a relay race
properly. The smaller clubs, after, trying
it without success for the past six years,
have latterly dropped out.
As to the merits of the teams this year,
the Bay Citys think tney will win. the
Olympics say the Garden Citys have the
strongest team, while the Garden Citya
are afraid of the Olympics. There are so
many new men on each of the t^ams, a3
will be noticed in the entries published
in The Call yesterday, that it Is almost
impossible to judge their abilities. Kach
team has confidence in itself, and tho
race will probably be evenly contested.

Hats Returning to Honolulu, a Sign
That Danger Is at an
End.
HONOLULU, May 4.â The quarantine
was raised on April 30 and Honolulu is a
clean port again. There has been an ex
odus from this city. It is expected that
there will be a great inward travel from
the other islands, for the country people
have been as anxious to get to town as
the town people have been to get out. Re
strictions on foreign travel have been re
moved, so that persons leaving by the
next steamers will not take the prophy
lactic. Clean bills of health are given to
all outward vessels.
Rats are returning to Honolulu. This
Important fact has been ascertained by
the Board of Health in several ways.
This morning two men living ih different
localities reported that the rats had re
turned. None had been seen in. either
place in 'several months. Prior reports of
the same kind proved to be true.
The conclusion of the board is that this
is one important indication that the
plague is at an end. as rats are. known to
run from it. The assumption is that the
rats vacated the city last autumn when
the plague first appeared and are now re
turning when it is over.

The exclusive news in The Call concern
ing the large purchases of real estate in
this city for the Southern Pacitlc Com
pany was the sensation of the week
among the dealers in realty. There is a
general expectation that other important
developments will follow.
Captain J. H. Bennett has purchased,
through Shainwald. Buckbee & Co., 50x
127:8 on the north line of Washing
ton street. 178 feet west of Spruce street,
upon which he will erect a residence.
Thomas Magee & Sons have sold a 50
vara on Fourth and Brannan streets, be
longing to F. S. Peabody. for $33,500. The
property was recently leased and a large
woodon building was going up on it un
der the lease. . This will be completed.
G. H. Umbsen & Co.. in their Real Es
tate Record, say that country lands In
California are now on a sound, paying
basis, and for the following reasons:
"There has been more rain than in fne
two previous seasons, when California
pulled through all right. Looking at the
situation from a business standpoint the
prospects for the horticultural interests
are of the best. The canning industry Is
on a better and a more extended basis
than ever before. The stocks of canned
and dried fruits have been depleted to an
extent greater than In many years. With
the indications of an increased demand
for these products of the State the decid
uous fruit grower should be easily able
to dispose of all his fruits with the
chances of obtaining higher and more
profitable prices than in the past. At this
writing it is impossible to speak with cer
tainty of the handling of the great raisin
and prune crops, but the indications are
favorable for the solution of the problem
in the interest of the co-operative
growers."
Assf-Fsors in the oil counties have some
trouble this year in determining the as
sessable value pt oil lands. In Fresno
County the Board of Supervisors have
been conferring with County Assessor
Ferguson, and a request for the employ
ment of special counsel made by Mr.
Ferguson was denied. One of th*> hardest
questions that the Assessors of "Kern and
Fresno counties will have to consider this
year has been brought to the front by the
rapid development of the oil industry in
these sections. What an oil well is worth
is something that many owners of shares
in oil companies would like to find out.
In Los Angeles during the, month of
April the permits to build represented a
value of $170.9r> in the aggregate.
Roal estate sales and building improve
ments continue active in San Diego. Up
to date the value represented by building
permits is three times as preat as it was
up to the corresponding date last year.
The permits for 1S9S amounted to ?243,-

ty acres in Los Angeles, opposite the
grounds of the Country Club, in the south
western part cf the city. The price paid
was $20,000. TK? property will be subdi
vided into building lots.
Los Angeles is about to have a new six
story hotel building at the southwest cor
ner of Spring and Fourth streets, the lot
being 120x150 feet. The hotel will be built
by an Eastern man. J. W. Hunt, of Ashe
ville. N. C. The owner is reported to have
recently paid $110,000 for a one-fourth in

TACOMA, Wash., May 11.â Mighty old
Yukon, the miners' highway during win
ter to the Klondike gold fields, is break
ing up. It will be soon, if it is not now,
free of ice, which is so rotten that the
Northwest mounted police last Friday
prohibited navigation on Lake Bennett.
News of the threatened break-up came
to-day from Bud Harkins i and E. H.
Clear, two passengers from. Dawson.
They are probably the last men to get
out this season over the ice. Mr. Harkins
has the distinction of being one of the
very first men to come out over the ice
last fall. Twelve days from Dawson was
the time made by Harkins and Clear.
They left Dawson April 22 and walked
every foot of the way.
They, report that nearly all the road
houses aro preparing to close; that sev
eral cattle expeditions were met on the
trail and that two mail parties were met
bound in. Mr. Clear says:
"The river is open from Thirty Mile to
Selkirk. The steamer Florence S3. was to
have left the foot of Lake Labarge for
Dawson during the week, and the Flora
was to have got away. They had some
passengers. At Dawson the trail is in
lair condition. The water which was on
the ice had disappeared. The cut-off was
bare and muddy. Labarge was good. We
passed two mail expeditions, one at Sel
wyn and one at Hootchlkoo. Both will
get in. The mail people used horses over
the Dominion cut-off, canoes from
Hootchlkoo to Selkirk and dog teams the
remainder of the distance
"A Frenchman with a herd of cows was
met between Cariboo and White Horse.
The Canadian Development Company is
closing its road houses on the cut-on".
The roadhouse at Labarge and river
points will remain open with hopes of
continued patronage from river travei

SEATTLE, May 11.â Telegraphic reports
regarding river conditions on the Yukon
to E S Busby, agent of the Canadian
customs at Skaguay, at noon on May 5
were as follows: , ' .'
White Horseâ The river Is open out into
Lake La Barge two or three miles. Lower
La Bargeâ Lake is becoming very soft and
bad. Five Fingersâ Water is at a stand
still and ice is jammed at Five Fingers
and above. Big Salmonâ River is open to
within six miles of Tantalue and there is
a big jam there. River is rising fast, about
three inches a day. Tantalusâ Ice has been
running since last night. River rose a
few inches during night. Hootalinquaâ
River is Jammed in several places and
seems to be breaking. _
Alaska papers recelvea in Seattle pub
lish the fact that the first steamer of the
Â«eason to turn a wheel on the Yukon is
the Florence S. i She got under way and
steamed from Hootalinqua to Lower La
Barge, passing up through Thirty-mile
River. This marks the beginning of navi
gation on the Yukon for the season of 1900.
KILLED BY ELECTRICITY.
Man and Woman Come in Contact
With Live Trolley Pole.
LOS ANGELES, May 11. â An accident
early this morning, which resulted in the
death of Mrs. Lizzie Wozencraft, was a
most peculiar one. The woman was killed
by a shock of electricity which came
down through an iron trolley pole. She
and her husband lived on Santa Fe. ave
nue, south of Fifth street. They had
been drinking heavily and last night
started uptown, both intoxicated, as the
man says. At Fifth and San Pedro streets
Wozencraft stumbled against one of the
poles supporting the trolley line. One of
the brace wires became loosened from the
wire conducting the circuit and fell, rest-
Ing on the pole.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Exhales from children as fragrance from
flowers. The little lips are always puck-
ered to give or take a kiss. In homes
where there are children, love reaches
its fairest and sweetest proportions. In
childless homes the kiss of wife and
husband grows formal, and presently is
neglected ; the springs of love in the
heart become choked for want of use
and exercise. Childlessness is a great
sorrow to many women. It is like a
curse from Nature, who bids all crea-
tures to be fruitful. It is not a curse
but a misfortune. Often the conditions
which cause childlessness are removable.
T.r. Pierce's Favorite Prescription has
brought joy to many a woman by giving
her the happiness of motherhood. It
gives to the womanly organs vigor and
vitality, removes local obstructions, and
practically does away with the pains and
pangs of maternity.
There is no alcohol or narcotic in * Fa-
vorite Prescription."
"I hsvc never written you how grateful I am

OVER and over again efforts have been made
to put an end to the free distribution of seed

subject and care very little for seed obtained in that
The first of these assertions is correct enough. The.
practice does injure the legitimate seed business. Ths
second is open to dispute. Some recipients of Con
gressional bounty in the way of seed may be un
affected by the gift, but now and then there is one
who feels a deep gratitude and does not hesitate to
express it.

A GRfTTEfUL CONSTITUENT.
California Ii2Â« two members of the Public Lands
Committee of the House and one member of tha:
committee in the Senate. It would seem that these
members of Congress should have sufficient influence
to get justice to California settlers who want land.
The State wants them to have it. We want more set
tlers, more homes, more land tilled, more surplus
j-roduccd to export and bring back wealth for our
people. We war.t more thousands of self-supporting,
fcH-rcspecting citizens, and we don't want the public
domain frescoed with scrip secured by speculators.
The State Board of Trade has taken up this matter,
and as far as we know is the only organization that
has seen the necessity for action. We ask other citi
zens who know the facts to let us know them. When
settler? petition for smveys, as the law requires, there
must be some way of getting for them their legal
rights.
THE letter of Mr. McFaull. indorsing The Call'?
demand that the public lands of California be
surveyed in the interest of the actual settler,
discloses conditions which make such survey an
emergency iÂ«sue. It is an insufferable situation that
petitions of actual settlers for surveys are pigeon
holed, while scrip-holders are plastering; the public
domain and causing its withdrawal from market.
The actual settler has no money to buy scrip, no lands
in hand to exchange for lieu scrip. He makes his
living out of land as an owner and tiller of the soil.
The laws of the country put the land within his reach.
if it be surveyed so that he can make his location and
get his paicnt when lit has fulfilled the conditions oi
ownership. To put on the unsurveyed domain the
permanent blister of a scrip lien and put it beyond
the reach of such settlers is the wrong policy.

SALARIES OF NATIONAL OFFICIALS.
DOCUMENT No. 56 of the Republican Club oi
the City of New York contains an elaborate
argument in favor of an increase of official
salaries by the National Government, and presents an
array of facts and statistics interesting as an evidence
of the conservatism which has controlled Congress
year after year in dealing with such questions. It
appears from the record that, with the exception of
the increase in the salaries of the President and Judges
of the Supreme Court in 1873, the diplomatic service
in 1856 and of Congress in 1866, there has been no
general revision or increase of the salaries in the
great departments of the Government since the act of
March 3, 1853, passed under, the administration of
President Fillmore, more than forty-five years ago.
Owing to a lack of a comprehensive revision of
the salaries of our officials we have the result that one
of the subordinates of the Secretary of the Treasury
now receives a salary of $12,000 per annum, while the
Secretary himself receives only $8000; and one of the
assistant Treasurers of the United States receives
$8000 a year, while the Treasurer receives but $6000.
Furthermore, it is pointed out that' the Judges of the
Supreme Court in the County of New York receive
$17,500 per annum, or $7000 more than the Chief Just
ice and $7500 more than the Associate Justices of the
Supreme Court of "the United States; and the city
police magistrates of. the city of New .York receive
$7000 per annum, or $1000 more than the Cireuit and
$2000 more than the District Judges of the United
States. . -^ -
At the time when the present salaries of the Vice
President and the Cabinet officers' were fixed, in the
closing days of Fillmore's administration in 1853, and
the revision of ; the diplomatic salaries was made in
1856, the United States 1 had a population of hardly
more than 25,000,000, and the annual revenues from all
sources were less than $59,ooo,of5o. At the present
time the population of the country is estimated at
more than 75,000,000, and our annual revenue now ex
ceeds $500,000,000. It is clear, therefore, that if the
strength and wealth of a nation be proper standards
by which to regulate the salaries and dignities of its
officials, we can well afford' to 'pay* far more than the
sums fixed in the old days of Fillmore!
In conclusion, the report, which was drawn up by
the committee on national affairs of the, club, says:
"Congress should take immediate measures to revise
the salaries in all the great departments of the Gov
ernment, placing them on a business basis, and accord
to each officer a fair and reasonable salary for the
services rendered. Is there- a wage earner in any oc
cupation within the limits of the republic whose wages
or salary has not been materially increased during the
last twenty-five years except the Government officers?
In the revision of salaries if Congress should accord
to the President of the United 'States the salary now
paid to the President of France, which*- has less than
"one half of our population, and whose national debt is
more than four times larger^it would at least solve the
problem of "what we ought to do with our ex-
Presidents."
One of the Bryanite campaign calculators says -New
York, Ohio. Indiana and Minnesota are doubtful
States this year, and on '-that basis he Â¦Â¦ estimates that
Bryan has a chance, of election. It would have been
better for him to have said "a ghost of a chance."
., Our. Philadelphia contemporary is in error in say-;
ing California is free/from forest fires because those
who "arc responsjble for them are punished. -The
losses by fire !in\this. State every year are enormous;
and it would be. difficult to point out a single instance
of the punishment of any one for causing them, either
hy the courts or by the summary action of the people-
Lynch, law punishmcqt, moreover, is not desirable."
What is needed is law/ and the importance of that law
is going to.be^demohstrated this year again as it has
been every. year o.f '.the; past since first the white man
established himself in the State.
Commenting 'upon the disastrous results of forest
fires within the last two or three : years the Philadel
phia Record says: "In the pinery region of Wiscon
sin hundreds of miles covered by the. best timber were
swept by a conflagration started by loggers in camp.
There were no arrests, and, therefore, other loggers
and the many; hunters who build fires in the woods
continue to be reckless. It is quite otherwise in Cali
forniar-not because of- the stringency of the laws,
but because of the certain "punishment of offenders
at the -hands of the people whose lives and property
are endangered.by forest fires." . â¢ ' .
Whether the agitation of the issue this year will
have much more effect than in past years remains to
be seen. It is certainly worth while, for! the press
throughout the country to give as mtich attention to
it as possible, for it is only by insistent repetition that
the evil results of. the. false economy of leaving the
forests unprotected can be made so clear to the peo
ple that they will eventually enforce by legislative act
a policy of true economy in protecting them.
FOREST FIRE WARNINGS.
\J\ ANY of our Eastern exchanges are making 1
I V A .^the approach of summer the occasion for re
viewing the campaign of education ' on the
subject 1 of "forest fires; and forest preservation. The
issue is a timely one because at this -season thousands
of dwellers"in:cities are- preparing for, camping expe
ditions in the woqds;; -and it : is H well known. that a con-'
siderable proportion. of _fqrest,.fires are : due to the
carelessness of : campers. The discussion of the mat
ter just now': has 'therefore the. double advantage of
putting intending campers, on guard against the dan
ger of fire and of impressing upon the public gener
ally . the importance of a V comprehensive 'system of
forest .protection'-- â¢ . : ;-,',;: ; / : i. '-'.;. .
: The subject .is lone- that fbc'rnany years, past has at-;

determination in;eaclv State to demand effective legis

ter, however,, popular interest on the subject has. died
out with the fires, and in hardly a single State has
anything like an. effective .supervision of forests been
provided. Some 'States -have done more than others,

gone insane on the belief that he is being pursued by
Southern Pacific detectives.
the Populist platform his report need not have been
changed.
Other features in that platform will have further
comment. -
It will be seen, then, that the financial theory upon
which Colonel Bryan is nominated comprises free
coinage of gold and silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, and
an unlimited issue of greenbacks. As in Japan, gold
and silver will both go to a premium in paper and
disappear. The difference in their premium over
paper will be the premium of gold over silver, and we
will be left with* all the evil effects of that system
which. appeared in Japan and everywhere where the
experiment has been tried.
If Mr. Uchida had set out to write a criticism oi
Here now is an experience external to us, the work
ing out of the financial problem by a people who
went through all its phases. They found themselves
io the grasp of the principles based in natural law
which were stated by Hamilton and Jefferson, who
agreed that the ratio of gold and silver is a commer
cial problem, determined by the market and not by
statute, and that our standard of value should be the
same as that of nations with which we have the great
est trade.
Mr. Uchida describes the effect of reducing several
kinds of paper currency to one kind and its redemp
tion in gold, making it par with that metal. He says:
"Prices have ceased to fluctuate as they did in former
times. The elimination of that risk from business cal
culations is resulting in a sound development of our
industries and commerce. This fact is shown by the
enormous increase within the last two years of the
clearings of the associated banks in Tokio and Osaka,
the two great centers of business activity in our coun
try; in the favorable condition of our foreign trade:
in the stability of prices for agricultural products and
in the wages of labor. In all domestic dealings the
purchasing power of the money used for payment is
at par with the money of nations enjoying the highest
economic development. This places those engaged
in agriculture and manufactures, the wage-earners
and the consumers )f imported goods, on a footing
of equality with all gold standard countries and se
cures for them every advantage that gold standard
countries have monopolized in dealing with silver
using countries. No effect of the adoption of the
single gold standard is more noticeable than the
benefits realized by merchants engaged in business
between Japan and other gold standard countries.
With the adoption of the gold standard the exchange
between those countries and our own became stable
and ceased to fluctuate with the silver market of the
world, which has been so unstable in recent years.
This benefit to the export merchants communicated
itself through them to those engaged in agriculture and
manufacturing, producing the commodities that enter
into our export trade." . â
By the year 1896 Count Matsukata was ready to be
gin his final reform, which was the establishment of
the single gold standard, and the new coinage law
declared: "The weight of two fun of pure gold shall
be the unit of value and shall be called one yen." One
fun is equal to 5.8333 grains avoirdupois. Approxi
mately this gold yen is one-fifth in weight of our gold
dollar.
"In 1881 Count Matsukata was appointed Minister
of Finance. The national currency was in a morbid
state and was working disastrous effects upon' indus
tries, commerce and finance. He advised that the cir
culation of the paper currency should be decreased;
that the specie reserve of the treasury should be in
creased, aiming at the final redemption of all paper
currency in specie; that for the establishment of a
sound currency system in our country a strong central
bank be organized, with the exclusive privilege of is
suing paper currency, redeemable on demand in
specie; that all Government and national bank notes
should be replaced with redeemable notes issued by
this bank."
"The law of 1878 was for the purpose of extending
the silver yen. But the attempt was made in vain,
for silver was no more patriotic than gold. It went
to a premium, owing to the excessive depreciation of
our paper currency, and disappeared from circulation,
the same as gold did, driven out by the cheaper paper
currency. The imperial Government found that it
could not maintain gold and silver on a parity by ad
mitting both .metals to free coinage on equal terms at
a ratio of 16.17 to 1, on account of the depreciation in
the price of silver as compared with gold in the mar
kets of the world. Unequal as to each other, both
metals were unequal with the depreciated paper cur
rency which took their place. Â¦ In 1878 gold was at
a premium over paper of 1 15.8, silver was at a pre^
ni-um of 103.3. In 1881 the gold premium over-paper
was 184. and the silver premium was 169.5. . This
shows that paper currencj- was rapidly depreciating,
and that gold and silver were gradually parting corn
pan}'. Under these circumstances both gold and sil
ver coins disappeared from circulation, and only
paper currency and some subsidiary coins were left to
be used in the daily transaction of business. â¢
Mr. Uchida says: "Our currency being different in
kind from that which was in general use in the inter
national commerce of neighboring countries, in 1878,
the imperial Government enacted a law making the
silver yen a legal tender for any amount and purpose
in all parts of the empire.. This put the silver yen
on an equal footing with the gold yen. It abolished
the gold standard and adopted the double standard,
with the free coinage of silver and gold on equal
terms, at the ratio of 16.17 to 1. Prior to this, in 1871,
the Government issued an enormous amount of in
convertible paper money. This paper, instead of
gold, became the monetary standard of trade.
It depreciated and drove gold out of circula
tion. Prices were quoted in the depreciated paper
currency and corresponded to the premium on gold,
so there was a general seeming appreciation of prices.
Mr. Uchida, a Japanese gentleman, has published
the financial experience of his country, to which we
call the attention of the supporters of this Populist
platform that demands free coinage of gold and silver,
at 16 to I, and an unlimited issue of greenbacks; gold,
silver and greenbacks to. be full legal tender.
Let us dispose of these financial propositions by
an experience outside of the United States, which
demonstrates that jiatural law operates everywhere in
the selection and circulation of a currency.
THE Populist convention at Sioux Falls, repre
senting the fusion wing. of that organization,
has met, resolved and nominated Bryan and
Towne. It was a large convention, but whether rep
resentative or not cannot be estimated, as the repre
sentation of States seems to have been manipulated
by the committee, so that the convention rather re
sembled a mass-meeting than a delegated body. The
first thirteen paragraphs in the platform and its pre
amble relate to the financial question. The gold stan
dard law is viciously denounced, the refunding of the
national debt at 2 per cent interest thereunder is
treated as a crime against the taxpayers, who have to
pay the interest.: The demand is made that all paper
currency be issued by the treasury direct,- in' the form
of greenbacks," as -full legal tender paper, money, with
its volume so controlled as to "maintain at all times
a stable price level."' The free coinage 'of silver at
\6 to i is demanded with a degree of ferocity unusual
even in Populist conventions.

etreÂ«t. to make room for a new building.
Is practically assured. One hundred and
eighty firms and individuals interested in
the property as shareholders have signed
an agreement to become members of a
new association, which assures the suc
cess of the project.
It haa been decided by the promotion
committee not to take any definite action
until 200 signatures have been obtained,
all of which will probably be secured
within a week. Then the directors of the
Produce Exchange, which organization
owns 2122 out of 2431 shares In the Mer

property at its market value to the new
association, and the old building will be
Fulled down, probably within the next six
month? The new building will b<* planned
on a cc.Tle that will make It easily one of
the finest devoted to a similar purpose In
the United States. The probable cost is
estimated at between SCOO.tvO and $700,003.
The purpose In this move is to make
room for a great commercial organization
in San Francisco that will correspond to
the Hoard of Trade of Chicapo. the Cham

embrace practically all the representa

Chronometers' Never Rated.
The Pacific Mall Company is out for the
mighty dollar and Collis P. Huntington
does not care who knows it. Not one of
the chronometers on the company's fleet
is ever rated, and nearly all the captains
go out with an instrument in which they
have small confidence, but on which,
nevertheless, the life of every man on
board may depend at any minute.
When a ship reaches port it is the cus
tom to send the chronometer at once to a
reputable clockmaker, who will "rate" it
and give the captain a card showing ex
actly how the instrument runs. Of course,
when the officers can take an observation
every day the chronometer is not of much
use except to verify the calculations, but
when a fog that will last for weeks is run
into, then the chronometer Is Invaluable
and its correctness may mean the salva
tion or destruction of the ship. Yet in
order to save a < paltry $50 a month the
Mall Company will not have its clocks
rated, and they are only attended to once
a year unless the captain pays for the
"rating" himself.

' Should disease break out among them
\ nothing could be done to check its pros
ress. The Chinese could not be moved to
a hospital in the city or to the quaran
tine station on Angel Island, as they have
no right to be in the country. In their
black den on the Mail dock they are by a
fiction of law on the deck of the vessel
upon which they came. Four vessels have
come and gone now and left their freight
of coolies. How many more are to come
and leave their yellow cargo can be only
a matter of speculation. The responsibil
ity for this condition of affairs rests with
Collector of the Port John P. Jackson and
after him with United States District At
torney Frank L>. Coombs.
The agents of the Pacific Mall Steam
ship Company played one of their usual
tricks yesterday in landing 191 Chinese
Mall dock Is perhaps the most important
dock on the Pacific Coast. Enormous
quantities of freight and . thousands of
passengers pass through it every month.
Above the heads of the passengers .are
these ill smelling coolies. ,
AS was expected, all was bustle and
confusion and excitement on the
Pacific Mall docit yesterday morn
ing. Chinese were moving here
end there in jabbering bewilderment. Offi
cials were herding coolies as if thty were
cattle. Agents of the Chinese ring were
busy looking: after the few Chinese whose
friends possessed money enough to entitle
them to special service and attention. As
The Call predicted, the Federal officials
did nothing to prevent the landing of the
coolies from the Coptic, and the Mail dock
was again the scene of another outrage.
Scores after scores of coolies were march
ed from the deck of the ship to the deten
tion shed until 131 had passed down the
gang plank on to American soil, where
they will remain not temporarily but in
definitely. Not until the officials deter
mine in their leisurely fashion the status
of these CM ye xv1.ll they leave the dock.
They have been landed in violation of the
f.plr.t of the exclusion act. and they will
remain in America until the Pacific Mail
and complacent officials see fit to remove
them.
Tfith the addition of those received yes
terday the detention shed and boarding
house row hold more than 370 Chinese who
have absolutely no right to set foot on
American so!l. These 370 Chinese net the
Pacific Ma.il Steamship Company nÂ» least
51S5 a day anJ the profit will continue in
defirJte'.y. Chinese from four vessels are
now in the detention shed, and a fifth
ship, the America Maru. entered port yes
terday with more than ITS Chinese on
board.
The detention shed has' now become a
positive and serious, menace to the people
of this city in several ways. In the first
place, it Is maintained In antagonism to
the epirit of the law. When Chinese are
placed In it they are landed In America in
defiance of section 9 of the exclusion act.
notwithstanding the fact that the various
steamship companies pledge themselves
for the safe keeping of the coolies. 'While
the men are in the shed they are per
mitted to Fee some of their powerful Chi
nese friends to be coached and Instructed.
Every possible avenue Is opened to fraud
and no opportunity to cheat the law is
lost by members of the ring.
More than this the detention shed and Its
coolie lnniates are maSntained as a men
ace to the people of the city. Health reg
ulations are violated openly , and impu
dently. The Chinese are crowded into the
pen likÂ» cattle and the odor which comes
frora their den Is sickening. The Pacific

on the Coptic and six claimed to bÂ« nathi
Â¦ons. This action of the officers of tfca
Chinese Bureau exposed another schema
of the Chinese ring. Hardly had th*
coolies been placed on board than the of
ficers were served with writs of habeas
corpus secured not from the Federal
courts but from the State courts.
The members of the ring are fearful or
the scrutiny made by United States Com
missioner Heacock and they will try. if
possible, to have their "native son" cases
tried In the State courts, where the facil
ities for Investigation and examination
are not as complete as In the Federal
courts. Upon these State writs six of the
"native sops" were landed to await a con
sideration of their claims. Five Chlnesa
captured In San Jose and found to be
Illegally In the country were marched to
the ship by a Deputy United States Mar
shal and were deported. Twenty-threo
more from Mexico, passing through this
city In bond, were also placed on the ves
sel and then twelve more were taken from
the detention shed by the customs officers
and marched to the ship.
The officers of the vessel refused to ac
cept the coolies, claiming that they should
be sent back on the vessel on which they
arrived In port. Not having come on the
Coptic the ship's officers emphatically re
fused to accept the coolies. The customs
officials were Insistent and the twelve
Chinese went back to China In company
with about 140 of their fellows.
It is thus evident that the reforms In
the Chinese traffic at thi3 port are very
far from being complete. The detention
shed is being made a source of enormous
profit to the steamship companies and Is
being maintained a3 a medium for the
perpetration of constant fraud. It la no
torious that agents of the Chinese ring
are permitted to enter it and confer with
the inmates. The guard is one only In
name. These agents of the ring operated
openly yesterday, as they have done .be
fore. They seek the first opportunity to
locate their men In the detention shed
and then begin the coaching which makes
merchants, students, tourists and natlvt
sons.
As the Coptic was going out of the har
bor with Its returning Chinese the Amer
ica Mara was coming in with another
load which will pas3 through * the same
process and in a few days find residence
In the sheds of the Mail dock. It is thus
evident that the officials have some very
curious notions regarding what a "tem
porary" landing may mean. Four ships
have come and gone and a fifth is In the
harbor, yet many of. the Chinese who
came on the first vessel are still In the
detention shed.
Considerable excitement was created In
Federal circles yesterday by the an
nouncement that the long expected and
much delayed investigation of the Chineso
traffic was about to begin. It was said
that Walter S. Chance, the Supervising
Agent of the Treasury, whose headquar
ters is at Washington. 13 on his way to
this city from Seattle and will arrive In
a few days to make a thorough Investiga
tion of the Chinese traffic.
from the Coptic on the detention dock.
When the officers of the Chinese Bureau
left the dock late Thursday afternoon the
Chinese -were still on the ship. When the
Inspectors of the bureau returned to the
dock yesterday morning the Chinese were
off the ship and safely housed In the de
tention shed. Fearful of the results of
agitation and publicity the agents had
taken the men off the vessel early in the
morning before the arrival of the Federal
officers. .
The addition of 191 to the 182 already on
the dock made a little army of coolies In
the shed and very materially Increases
the Ill-gotten revenue of the Pacific Mall.
As soon as the inspectors arrived at the
dock yesterday they took thirteen coolies
from the shed and 'marched them on the
ship for deportation. These coolies came

WORK OF THE .ANNUAL
SESSIONS ABOUT ENDED
HOW THE X-RAY
CURED A CANCER
DR. J. M. SELFRIDGE, the physi
cian of Oakland who was cured of
cancer by the X-ray, read yester
day before the State Homeopathic
Society a full statement of his case, its
origin, its treatment and Its final cure.
His paper was listened to with the most
intense interest, an Interest that was
heightened by the fact that one year ago
the man who was speaking was disfigured
with a cancer that had spread over al
most the whole left side of his face. His
opening remarks dealt with the X-ray It
self and Its sometimes injurious effects,
but after disposing of that part of his
subject, he spoke as follows:
Experience has taught us that some of ,thÂ«
potent poisons are our most precious acents
with which to cure disease. So with the X
rays. While they are able to destroy, they
have shown their healing virtues by changing
some of the most malignant pathological condi
tions Into that most enjoyable stateâ perfect
| health.
Now, If you will pardon the seeming egotism
In the- uee of the personal pronoun. I will
recount as briefly as I may the history of my
own case.
It waÂ«, without doubt, an epithelloma, which,
i as you know. Is a cancer of the skin, that has
) always been regarded as Incurable. About
I thirty-five years ago the first intimation 1 had
of it was a eensatlon of, tingling or crawling
i t>> the skin between the angle of the mouth
! and the wing of the nose on the right side.
j This continued for a time, when a thin, whitish
| scale made Its appearance. It Itched frequently,
I and was aa frequently > scratched off. After
| a while It would bleed when the scale was
j removed. This re-forming and removal of the
scale continued until a deep, open sore of small
size, which refused to heal, made Its presence
felt. It kept increasing in size, would scab
over, and with tingling and burning, gave con
| siilorable annoyance. Finally It became so
troublesome that I had it dissected out Just
sixteen years ago by the late Dr. PeaBe. There
was a email one at the wing of the left nostril
when the first operation was performed, which
Increased in size until about ten years ago,
when I had it removed by j the same surgeon.
But It returned again, and about seven years
ago It was removed by Dr. Lowry. It returned
Rtcain. but as the knife had failed three times
I concluded to try the efficacy of internal
homeopathic medication. Now, although its
progress under this treatment was h*ow. still
lt.8pread with sufficient rapidity to eat away
'Â¦ almost half of my nose, Including the car
tilaginous portion of the vomer, a portion of my
upper lip. a large hole in my left cheek, which
extended to the malar bone and was uncom
fortably near my left eye, which I expected to
lose within a few months. It had invaded my
mouth and eaten away a portion of the gums
on the left, side, so that It was Impossible to
masticate solid food. Aa a consequence of this,
and the nervous Irritation, I lost twenty pounds ;
In weieht. The entire sore surface. Including
the Inside of the nostril, which was a mere
shell was co^red with easily bleeding fungus
granulations. When touched with a probe
the sensation was as if a red-hot iron had. been
applied. Although it burned most of the time,
yet cold air, or the application of cold water,
made It ache. When covered too warmly It
was also painful. â¢ At times the pains were
hot and burning, as Jf hot needles were thrust
into it. These pains were irregular, and fre
quently eo sudden and severe as to cause me
to lose my self-control sufficiently to cry out.
The Fide of my face was- swollen and so sore
that I could not laugh without holding my
cheek with the hand. The superficial . nerves
were so sensitive that to be shaved was mild
torture. While there was ' no -enjoyment as
time went along, to contemplate the future was
by no means conducive to cheerfulness. But,
as I am not made of that kind of material that
ehows the white feather when . overtaken . by
misfortune, the Inevitable was accepted and
my round of duties continued from day to
day.
But a beam of light flashed across my hith
erto gloomy horizon. I was Informed by a
Dr. J. M. Selfridge's Paper Read
Before the State Society of
Homeopathists.
friend that a case of Lupus had been cured by
the X-rays, applied by Or. Krone. From fur
ther Investigation I learned that Dr. SchinT
of \ lenna was the first to successfully treat
Lupus with the rays.
These cures were supposed to depend upon
the eermieidal effects of the rays, but more
recent pxperlmenta have . demonstrated that
their ability to destroy germs Is no greater
than that of ordinary lijtht.
As a result of my Investigations, I concluded
to try the experiment. But. as I could not
make the application myself. I called on my
friend. Dr. N. H. Chamberlain, to ascertain
If he would be willing; to frfve his time and
sun his machine a sufficient number of times '
to test the virtue of the rays In a case like '
mine. .To this he kindly consented, and as
soon as I could procure the requisite quantity
cf lead rolled thin, we proceeded with the ex
periment, first having prepared a mask of suf
ficient dimensions to cover my whole face and
head. In this mask an opening wan cut suf
ficiently large to expose the sore and about a
quarter of an Inch of the skin around it. As
the inside of my left nostril was a mass of
disease, we had to expose about two-thirds
of what remained, so aa to have the rays pass
through it to the fungus mass within. As
a result of my Investigations. I was led to
the conclusion that in the experiments made
heretofore, the rays had been applied too long;
consequently, my suggestion to Dr. Chamber
lain was that we commence the treatment with
sittings of only five minutes' duration, with
the tube four or five Inches from .the sore.
Kverythlnft being In readiness, the first ap
plication was made October 12, 1S99, and con
tinued daily, five minutes each time, for eight
days, Sundays excepted. Having no personal
experience to guide us. and being anxious to
see some effect, I suggested to the doctor that
he give It for ten minutes, which was con
tinued for five days. But. from what fol
lowed, I am now of the opinion that It. would
have been better to have continued the flve
mlnute ulttlnKR. for during the night after the
fifth ten minutes' application, the unexpected
happened. A peculiar exudation made its ap
1 earance on the vermilllon portion of the
lower lip, and on what was left of the upper
lip. The exudate was in appearance like mush
rooms, about one-eighth of an Inch high, with
perpendicular sides and pearly' tops. They
spread over the parts exposed, which then had
the appearance of a false membrane, which,
when wiped off, left a bloody surface. They
re-formed several times, but finally healed, af
ter several weeks. An exudation appeared at
the same time on the nose, which resembled
a speck of pus.. This also spread over the part
exposed, and soon afterward the epidermis
came off, leaving a sore which also took weeks
to heal. I
After November 1." the rays were applied
every second or third day. until the. 20th. when
It was quite evident the healing process had
commenced. All pain and burning had already
ceased. The swelling and ., redness had dis
appeared and" cicatrization had " surely com
menced. For five days no treatments were
given. On November 25 the flve-mlnute
applications, were ( again commenced and
continued every second, third or fourth
days. as in my Judsrment they were
needed, until December , 27. January 4 and 8,
1S0O, . the rays were * given but-three minutes
each time, after which they were given five
mlnrtes : each time, and repeated as often as
was deemed necessary. As the healing pro
cess progressed, the lnodular tissue contracted
and drew the skin of the cheek with !t. so that
at the present time the ctcatrix Is not one
quarter as large as the original 6ore. â¢
The disease had eaten away all the mus
cular and mucus tissues, and had affected the
periosteum so that the cicatrlcial tissue above
the incisors is so thin and - the bjood ' supply
Is so limited, that the surface Is easily broken
down, . and, therefore, -requires an â¢ occasional
application- of the rays. The same condition
exists on a portion of .the' vomer.
The following questions are frequently asked
by interested persons: "Is It a cure?"; "Will
it ever return?" ,-, . /
All I .am- row. able to say Is. that It has
healed, and I have no more pain or discom
fort of any 'kind, either physical or mental,
except from ta knowledge of the loss of the
tissues previously mentioned; and I am in good
health and as 'happy as a , man can well be
under : such circumstances. .... .. :.
Whether it will- ever return time alone will
have to answer.; But If It should, we have the
time . potent remedy, â¢ which, having once . de
stroyed Its . malignancy -- and healed:. It, may
safely, be trusted to do the fame thing again.
This assurance makes the future bright.
The story of Dr. Selfridge's " experience
was : published in The Call some . time
ago.- but Â¦ yesterday for the: first Â¦ time! lie
gave his own plain statement* of his case.
. The homeopaths finished their session
last evenlnewith a whirlwind of business
that carried .them on past 6 o'clock. The

In the Bureau of Surgery Dr. George
mISS MAI MOODY and Douglas S.
Watson were married yesterday
morning at 7 o'clock at the home
of Dr. and Mrs. H. C. Davis on
Scott street. Rev. Arthur Crosby of San
Rafael performed the ceremony in the
presence of a few intimate friends of the
contracting parties. None of the members
af the bride's family was present.
Taken altogether the hurried union of
the young couple has all the features of
a splendid romance. Friends of Mr. and
Mrs. Watson declare that they have been
engaged for the past three years, although
no announcement of the betrothal was
ever made. However, this long engage
ment did not lessen the great surprise
the sudden wedding of the young couple
gave their swell society friends.
At the residence of the bride's family
Mr. Breeden, husband of Mrs. Watson's
twin sister, received all inquirers seeking
information In regard to the wedding and
to all made the same answer- "Mrs.
Moody declines to be interviewed. Mrs.
Breeden, the twin sister of the bride, is
critically ill and can see no one. I know
nothing of the wedding."
"We are old friends both of Mr. and
Mrs. Watson," Dr. Davis said, "and so
when we heard that they had decided to
be married we placed our home at their
disposal. Miss Moody's family did object
to the wedding. Why I'm sure I do not
know. Watson is an estimable fellow, of
excellent family, well educated, has trav
eled extensively and is very rich. The
young couple are very much in love with
one another and I'm sure they are happy."
Immediately after the ceremony the
newly wedded pair left on the overland
for New York en routo to Europe, and It
is their intention to remain abroad for a
year.
Douglas Watson is the son- of the late
Mr. Watson, who was senior partner of
Sloane & Co. | He is a Stanford graduate
and a member of the Bohemian Club. He
has an elegant home on Broadway and
Broderick' streets, where he has kept
bachelor apartments. Mr. Watson's bride
is the daughter of Millionaire Joseph LÂ».
Moody, who died a few weeks ago. She
is extremely beautiful and is considered a
belle in exclusive social circles.
At the Davis residence full Information
was given In regard to the hurried nup
tials.

Golden Gate's Anniversary.
California Chapter No. 1. Order of the
Eastern Star, celebrated its thirty-first
anniversary by a dance party in Golden
Gate Hall last night. It Was an invita
tional affair, which was att-ended by many
of the most prominent members of the
order.' Of the charter members there were
but four present, two of them being Wil
liam S. and his wife, who founded
the order in thi* State. Florin I.. Jones
was the floor manager, assisted by Grore*;
T.,: Darling, J. J. Mitchell and Ernest K.
Head.
RAILWAY CONDUCTORS PLAN
FOR THEIR ANNUAL OUTING
the Southern Pacific. The court circular
brought out Moses Gunst as a candidate
for delegate to the National Republican
Convention from the Fourth Congressional
District. It is whispered that Martin
Kelly and Phil Crimmins, who take or
ders from Herrln. consented to smooth
the way for sending Gunst, the old-time
nickel-!n-the-slot Democratic politician,
to Philadelphia as the representative of
the Republican voters of the Fourth Dis
trict.
C. P. Huntington. who is in the city, is
fond of saying to his old-time friends and
associates that the railroad is out of poli
tics and intends to stay out. He is right
on the general proposition that the com
pany ought to keep out of politics. Noth
ing is gained by meddling in the affairs
cf either one of the great political parties.
The Republicans are not threatening to
far up his tracks and derail his trains.
Republican* are not advocating a princi
ple of hostility to railroad corporations.
Dibble. Gunst. Mackenzie, Martin Kelly,
Phil Crimmins and Watt are not needed
to stand guard over railroad property.
No one is enlisting to cinch the corpora
tion over which Mr. Huntington presides.
Should there be any doubt, however, as
! to the truth of the assertion that the rail
road is in politics, let Mr. Huntington call
Mr. Herrin into his private office and ask
I him the question straight between man
i and man if he (Herrin) was not a party
I to the programme for bringing out Gunst
j as a candidate for delegate.
REPUBLICANS OF THE
NORTH WILL UNITE
N. D. Hideout Advocated as a Candi
date for Delegate at Large to
National Convention.
The Republicans of Northern Califor
nia, who were slighted in the la-^t State
Convention of the party, have resolved to
place in the field a candidate for delegate
at large to the National Convention at
Philadelphia. It is known that Southern
Â«'alifomla will present the name o*
I'ly^ses S. Grant Jr. The Republicans of
Northern California will rally around a
candidate from the north. N. D. Rideout
of Marysville is mentioned as an accept
able man. Many of his friends are advis
ing him to <>nter the race and are giving
him assurance of cordial support.
In thÂ«Â» report of th*Â» proceedings of the
Napa County Convention A. A. Stlllwoll
was mentioned as /having been elected
delegate to the Republican State Conven
tion. The name should have been given
as A. A. Stillman.

Owing to the disadvantages which her
profession imposes, from Its very nature
failing to perpetuate Individual genius, it
is difficult for posterity to put a sympa

Aside from the fart that she was easily
the finest actress America has ever pro

Slddons she proved to her countrywomen
the possibility of gaining the topmost
round of the histrionic ladder with un
blemished reputation. In her private lift,
affectionate, tenderly fond of children,
generous with her strength, her sympathy
and her purse, with a heart which Law
rence Barrett described "as gentle an
Infancy." nnd with u deep religious trust,
she was greatly beloved by a largo circle
of friendM. They looked with grief upon
the prolonged and intense sufferings of bÂ«T

fortitude with which she met tho final

I have experienced for a Ions time. I
give you my word, when I turned and

Rather masculine in appearance, she de
veloped a propensity for appearing in
male parts. Hamlet- Romeo, Claude Mel

prominent efforts in this line. While her
Cardinal Wolsey was considered In many

COMMITTEE OF ARRANGE
MENTS FOR THE CONDUC
TORS 1 EXCURSION
Cb.arlof.te Cushman. the greatest of
American actresses, was of strong Pur
itan ancestry and born in the city of Bos
ton 1816. From childhood she showed a
grave and earnest character, a disposition
to avoid young companions and a fond
ness for practicing singing arid poring
over tragedy. Her voice proved of such
exquisite quality that she was determim-d
to go on the stage, and at the age of ID
made her debut in Boston as a vocalist.
This step was strongly opposed by her
clerical relatives, who were Indignant
that the name of their grandfather's
great-grandfather, Robert Cushman. who
preached tho first sermon In New Eng
land, should thenceforth' be associated
with the stage. Persevering, nevertheless,
in her chosen occupation. Charlotte Cush
man began singing in different cities.
In New Orleans her voice was so affect
ed by the climate that she was compelled
to modify' her plans and devote^herself to
acting. In a little room In the Crescent
City she labored zealously over the char
acter of Lady Macbeth until she felt com
petent to appear in that famous role.
Finding her singing voice Irretrievably
impaired, she began studying the drama
with even greater seriousness. While she
sometimes showed herself to be a charm
ing comedienne, she felt herself irresist
ibly drawn to the higher plane of tragic
acting, and her Instant reputation as a
tragedienne but increased her confidence
in her original convictions.
The following year (1S36) she appeared
in the same character in New York and
induced her sister Susan also to depart
from the traditional family pathway and
act with her. They appeared together In
Philadelphia, where Charlotte Cushman
became manager of one of the theaters
until Macready came to this country, then
she played with him.
Next to that of- Lady Macbeth, her most
important Impersonation was that of Meg
Merrilies, the result of a happy inspira
tion while she was acting as understudy
to Mrs. Chippendale. While waiting in
the side scene, book in hand, the wonder
' ful dramatic possibilities of the character
burst upon her. Seizing upon the sudden

(1S1S-1ST6).
Because of the strong interpretative
power which she possessed in her voice
she did not need to resort to the usual
stage artifices, and Henry Irving, who
acted with her in his youth, testified to
the kindly advlc*Â» which she gave him re

quote her own simile, "to keep the prow
always turned toward good."
After thirty-five years of successful act
ing, both in this country and in England,
where she was accorded an unusually high
position as an actress, she determined to
devote the remainder of her life to public
readings. At the reading desk she con
fined herself chiefly to Shakespearean in
terpretations and found it afforded finer
opportunity for her subtle IntellectuaUsm.
In her acting of Lady Macbeth James
Murdoch declares that "she caught tho
facts of a character, but Its conceits were
beyond her reach. * â¢ â¢ She was in
tensely prosÂ»aic. definitely practical, and
hence her perfect identity with what may
be termed the materialism of Lady Mac
beth." William C. Macready. always* gen
erous in acknowledging her powers,
averred that when playing Macbeth to her
Lady Macbeth he felt himself to be "less
than of secondary importance â in truth,
a mere thing of naught." At the reading
desk, however, there was no chance for
conflicting opinion. Here there was no
opportunity for displaying her marvelous
talent of "making up." no scenic setting
nor realistic claptrap, nothing but that ex
quisite elocution, accommodating Itself to
the varying necessities of the play, bal
ancing every character, and producing
upon the fascinated audience the convic
tion that Shakespeare could have no
grander exponent. Solely by the charm
of her rich, supple voice she portrayed
the intellectual body of the poet's concep
tion, so using It to set forth the groan of
agony, the struggling sensations of death,
the hollowness of remorse, the abandon
of dÂ»Â»apair and the tremulous pathoa "f
old age. that. the totality of the drama
represented had a powerful, oftentimes an
appalling, effect upon her hearers. Law
rence Barrett, in -speaking of the chllly
horror which her voice produced in on* of
her finest Impersonations, said. "It sound
, ed as if she spoke through blood."

POSTUM CEE.EAL.
WINE VS. COFFEE
A Test Case.
"A winemaker's v.ife on whom I was
calling a year or two ago urged me to
drink a large cup of very strong coffee
when I had declined to take a glafs of
win* for the reason that the wine af-
fected me unpleasantly. The coffee was
so strong that my head reeled and rolled
for two or three days, and I decided the
wine would have been the more temper-
ate drink after all.
"I haJ been a moderate user of coffee
but had been suffering from sick head-
aches for some time and was becoming
very suspicious that coffee was the
cause of them. After this experiment
the drug power of coffee was made so
plain that I abandoned it altogether and
had a long season of hot water drinking,
which is not enjoyable, as you will ad-
"After awhile I was introduced to
Postum Food Coffee, and it proved a
joy and promise of pleasure to come. It
tasted so much like coffee that I waited
for some of the evil effects to develop.
They did not come, so I drank it three
times a cay and still continue. The habit
spread from me to the rest of the fam-
ily. Even father, a confirmed coffee-
drinker. 84 years old, now drinks Pos-
tum with great relish, and his health has
been better the past winter than for sev-
eral years.
"On Christmas we had a reunion of
several old-time friends and served Pos-
tum instead of coffee. One of the ladies,
who holds an important educational po- I
Â«ition and must care for her nerves, said,
â¢Give me the smallest cup â I dare not
drink coffee.' She was told that it was
not coffee, but was Postum. After drink-
ing a little of it she said. 'I never liked
Postum before. The way we made it, it
was so colorless and flat, but this is deli-
cious/ and she passed up for a second
cup.
"I explained that she could always
have Postum delicious if she would fol-
low the directions as to the amount to
use and time to boil." Mrs. M. P.

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May* 11.â Bradstreet's flnanclal
review to-morrow will say: S
Irregularity prevailed this week In the move
ment of quotations for securities. Speculation
is exceedingly dull and continues to be almost
entirely confined to professional Interests. This
element, as was noted last week, had become
In the main bearish in sentiment and its oper
ations for short account '. resulted In more or
less depression throughout both the railroad list
and the industrials, attended in the Â¦ case â¢ of
certain Blocks by a good deal of positive liqui
dation. The steel stocks appeared at first likely
to furnish reason for a further unsettling of the
general market and that part ot the list showed
decided heaviness - last Monday, . when- the' re
ports of . a conservative .banking house retired
from the directory of the American^ Steel and
Wire Company; on the ground that the resigna
tion of the company's chairman, Mr.* Gates, was
not forthcoming, as, it was ulleged, ;had been
promised. Later on, however," the. steel Â» stocks
withstood both a continuance of : bearish press
ure and the news that one. of the plants of the
Federal Steel Company had , been shut down
This last announcement was offset ' in a measl
ure by the resumption of -work at, some of the
mills of â¢ the steel- and -., wire company, and
as Â¦: further - reductions In prices j for â¢ various
steel - and . iron ' products were- announced It
seems that the market had sufficiently, discount
ed the unfavorable developments in this connec

developed 'steadiness In the face i of the heavy

Nnv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, May 11.â The stock market suc
cumbed again to-day to the pressure of liquida
tion, which effectually overbore whatever ele
ments of strength showed In the early trading,
wiped out yesterday's recoveries and carried
prices down in many Instances to the lowest
of the week. There was nothing In the news of
the day to account for the renewed weakness In
stocks beyond the general supposition that to
morrow's bank statement will show a further
considerable reduction of the surplus reserves.
It waa very evident early in the day that the
demand from the outstanding short Interest
who had sold precipitately in the break of
Wednesday had been about satlitfled. No out-
Eld*? demand had been attracted and the bull
pools, which had resumed operations yesterday,
found the task of holding up their favorites a
hard one. They had some assistance from Lon
don, where the market made a show of
Hrength, eccourared by developments In South
Africa. The opening prices here were about
the highest. The considerable gains shown by
Missouri Pacific, Baltimore and Ohio and Na
tional Steel yielded to the selling pressure and
were wiped out. the first two stocks taking
their place among the weakest of the railroad
list. Southern Railway preferred was another
severe sufferer. The principle examples of
weakness, however, were found among the epe
cialties and industrials. Sugar and Steel and
Wire were weak from the opening. American
Tobacco was under severe pressure all day on
rumors of a projected competitor and the price

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
NEW YORK, May 11.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: -. .:'
The trade situation this week may be summed
up In- the phrase: Inactive demand and weaker
prices. "
While; In many respects the Industrial situa
tion ; Is /easier than . it was the unsettlement in
the building; trades continues marked, the reflex
action being exhibited in unsettled demand for
building material and weaker prices for lumber
and for many products used in the building in
dustry. Â¦
Iron ; and steel buyers are still holdlns off.
most of the business done being for small lots
for. immediate consumption. Further declines
are noted in steel billets and for some finished
products, while sympathetic Â¦ weakness is re
ported in the other metals, such as copper, lead
and . tin. There : were . slight increases of the
output of pig iron during the month of April
and a small gain In lurnace and other stocks.
Steel rails and structural | material are conspic
uous exceptions to the:' weakness above noted,;
pri6es for . these products being firmly main
tained. Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ : '
In speculative markets dullness has been the
feature, wheat, after considerable steadiness,
weakening; on the favorable Government crop
report, which Is taken to indicate a yield of
winter wheat JOO.OOO.COO bushels larger than a
year ago, notwithstanding immense damage
from winter killing in the Central Western
States, apparently offset, however, by a high
condition In States west of the Mississippi.
Relatively good reports come from the retail
trade at most centers, notwithstanding the
backward spring:, but as yet the volume of re
order business from wholesalers and Jobbers has
proved disappointing.
Finished cotton and woolen products remain
steady. Wool is weaker, owing to restricted
demand from manufacturers and In sympathy
with lower, prices set at many grades at the
London wool sales. ! Primary wool markets are
higher than in the East Print cloths, though
nominally held firm at Fall River, continued to
be offered below the Liverpool price. Coffee
Is rather weaker, owing. to lower quotations in
European markets, and sugar is also shaded,
owing, to receipts exceeding requirements. Rel
atively a good report comes from the distribu
tion trade In shoes, but manufacturers are
hanging back in their purchases of leather, and
hides are -rather weaker.'- Relatively the bebt
trade reports still come from the Pacific Coast
market, but better weather conditions at the
1 South have tended to brighten trade reports
from that section.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the>
week aggregate 3.4S0.374 bushels, against 4,537,
022 last week; 3.284,182 In the corresponding
week of 1899. 3.64G.543 in 189S. 2.5S3.875 In 1897 and
1,903,225 in 1896. Since July 1 this season the ex
ports of wheat aggregate 1C9.506.CO6 bushels,
against 203,038,784 last year and 2C2.G23.C04 In
1ES7-9S. â¢ ... Â¦
Business failures In the United States for the
week number 174, as compared with 133 last
week, Ifi9 a year ago, 250 In 1S9S, 251 in 1S97 and
265 in 1S96.
Business failures for the week In the Domin
ion of Canada number 19, as compared with 19
last week, 21 last year. 25 In 1898, 31 in 1897 and
24 in 1S96.

Â¦ . London Market.
j.
NEW YORK, May ll.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London flnanclal cablegram says:
The markets here were rather harder to-day,
although there were' signs of liquidation In
Grand Trunk and Westrallans. Business, how
ever, was slack at the beginning of the set
tlement. . There was some talk of peace, based
on a report that the Volksraad had given the
Transvaal Government authority to act as cir
cumstances may require, coupled with the Cabi
net council to-day, but this was merest sur
mise. Funds rallied Â¦ on the sudden easing of
money. _ - ,'Â¦ Â¦ :
Americans began firm, some of them going
a dollar over parity, but the public was en
tirely absent and professionals were very cau
tious. New York did nothing until the close,
but In the street Â¦ offered stock caused a final
ssg. Baltimore and Ohio's course had sick
ened London. â¢
It Is thought the Boer emissaries' visit to
America will cause temporary disturbance in
the United States, affecting the market. Tln
tos spurted to 55',Â« on the ten shillings rise
In metal but relapsed to 54% on Paris sales
before the settlement. Anacondas were sup
ported.
The bank bought Â£24,000 gold In German coin
and was notified of Â£50,000 at the Cape; Â£100,
000 in transit from Japan will probably be In
tercepted. Money was almost unlendable. .

SANDON WAS BURNED
TO CONCEAL A CRIME
Body of a Murdered Man Found in
the Building in Which the
.vi Fire Started.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, May 11.â As the re
sult of investigations made by the friends
of Miles Rombough, the gambler who^e
body was found in the ruins of the burned
mining town of Bandon a week ago it has
developed that the flre which wiped out
the little town between the mountains
was of Incendiary origin, and the man
who fired the first building was the mur
dcrer of the gambler. Rombough's body,
although charred, showed plainly that It
had been decapitated, and the badly
burned head was lying near by. He had
a large sum of money on his person, hav
ing on the afternoon of the fire drawn $300
from the bank, and not a vestige of this
was found after Use fire.
Rombough, who was a. professional gam
bler, went to Sandon from Kaslo, a near
by mining town, on the clay prior to the
rire. He showed his money freely, al
though advteed to keep it out of sight
owing to the prevalence of tough char
acters". He put up at the. Clifton House
and was not seen by any one after going
to his room until his body was found In
the ruins. He was not missed owing to
the excitement consequent on the fire. It
is plainly evident that he was murdered
by some unknown person or persons and
robbed and the hotel set on flre to hide
the crime. No other satisfactory expla
nation has been offered as to the origin
of the fire which destroyed the town and
rendered so many homeless.

FIRST LADY ADVANCE Â¦
AGENT IN THE LAND
OAKLAND, May 11. -â¢ Miss May
Eleanor Gates, a University of Cal
ifornia co-ed, has found the newest
field of activity for modern woman
kind. She has, after receiving favorable
commendation from President Benjamin
Ide Wheeler,' decided to. enter the field
of theatricals from the business side of
the profession. The stage itiself had no
attractions for Hhe talented young
woman, but when she received a flattering
offer to become the first woman advance
agent for a theatrical troupe. Miss Gates
consulted with her friends and then ac
cepted.
On Sunday, therefore, she will start
ahead of the "Brownies," which will" -be
sent for a Southern California tour by
Manager S. H. Friedlander of the Cali
fornia Theater. Miss Gates has had four
years of experience in newspaper work,
combining journalism with her university
studies. Her freshman year was spent at
Stanford University. Since then she was
selected as one of the eight young women
who were awarded Mrs. Phebe Hearst
scholarships for the University of Cali
fornia. Miss Gates is a member of the
class of '02.
Hor tour will cover three months, and
all of the varied duties of an advance
agent are included under the contract the
young collegian has signed. She will nat
urally devote much of her work to the
press. Miss Gates' home is in Oakland.
Kor many months she has been society
editor for the Oakland department of the
San Francisco Call. Before that time she
had been employed on general and special
newspaper work.
She leaves with the distinction of being
the first woman in the United States to
take up the special line of work which

NO INDICTMENTS MADE
IN CRAVEN-FAIR CASE
Grand Jury Takes No ActionâInves
tigating Waller-Seifert
Charges.
The Grand Jury did not return any in
dictments yesterday In the charges of per
jury and subornation of perjury growing
out of the Craven-Fair contest, despite
sensational rumors that true bills would
be returned against Mrs. Craven, Adolph
Sylva and Justice Simpton.
Secretary Rock of the Grand Jury stat
ed that the matter had been under con
sideration for some time, but no conclu
sion had been arrived at. He was not pre
pared to say whether any Indictments
would be returned nor when they would
be tiled if at all. District Attorney Bying
ton said that no indictments in the case
had been presented to the Grand Jury. It
has been published several times that at
least three indictments will be brought
against those who have been mixed up In
the Simpton affidavits, and the prophecy
that they would be filed before Judge
Dunne yesterday was simply a wild guess
and nothing more.
The jury continued yesterday the In
vestigation of the alleged selling of exam
ination questions of the State Board of
Pharmacy by members Waller and Sel
fert. The witnesses examined were Fred
C. Engelsby, John Seebold, T.II. Harper.

According to Its natural meaning It
would seem that a cold was an affection
produced by exposure to low tempera
tures, to cold weather. Nothing could very
well be farther from the truth than thi3.
Colds are not nearly so common in ex
tremely cold countries as in the temper
ate zone. They are not nearly so fre
quent high up amid the Alps as In the
cities at the foot of the mountains. Nan
sen, the arctic explorer, spent over two
years amid the arctic- snows with the
temperature so low most of the time that
the mercury was frozen In his thermom
eter, yet he and his men never suffered,
from a cold. They had been back in civil
ization scarcely a week before some of hl3
companions were laid up with the grip.
Cold Does Not Cause Colds.
PHELAN'S POLICY
IS DENOUNCED BY
ANGRY CITIZENS
Knights of Honor Insist Upon
Protection Prom Mid
night Thieves.
Mayor's Financial Scheme in Throw
ing the City Into Darkness and
, : Inviting Crime Emphatic
ally Condemned.
The policy of Mayor Phelan In throwing
the city into darkness every night after
12 o'clock and subjecting the people of
San Francisco to the outrages of thieves
and assassins has brought forth another
vigorous protest from citizens. Bortz
meyer, the young rihxn who was robbed
and shot on hla way home a few nights
ago, was a merabsr of Yerba Buena Lodge
No. 1788. Knights of Honor. This lodge
has drafted and sent to Chief of Police
Sullivan a series of resolutions condemn
ing the police for their Inability to cap
ture the thieves and suppress the out
rages. The financial policy of Mayor Phe
lan In throwing the city Into darkness Is
roundly denounced, and the members of
the order declare that it may be necessary
for the different fraternal organizations' to
create vigilance committees for their own
protection:
While the protest of the Knights of
Honor is timely and thoroughly justified,
all blame should not be placed on the Po
lice Department. The t Call is not an apol
ogist for the police, but every one knows
that tne department has been seriously
and dangerously handicapped by the
wretched policy of Mayor Phelan. Blame
should rest where it belongsâ on the shoul
ders of the Mayor, who has constituted
himself the responsible government of
this- city. It is his kindergarten municipal
government which is jeopardizing the
lives of. citizens and giving rein to the
criminal elements of the town.
The communication of the Knights of
Honor' to the Chief of Police is as follows:
W. P. Sullivan, Chief of Police, San
Francisco, Cal.: At a meeting of
Yerba Buena Lodge No. 1788, Knights of
Honor, held on May 7, a committee was
appointed to draft resolutions expressive
of our indignation at the apparent inabil
ity of the police force of this city to prop
erly protect the lives of its citizens. The
committee prepared the following, resolu
tions, which were adopted by the lodge
and ordered transmitted to you:
Whereas, J. Fred Bortzmeyer, an hon
ored and esteemed member of this lodge,
and a young man of exemplary character,
was robbed and shot on the streets of this
city on the night of May 2 while peace
fully pursuing his way to his home from
the Young Men's Christian Association
building; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, as members of this
lodge, deeply deplore the seeming inca
pacity of the police authorities of this city
to properly protect the persons and lives
of its citizens and. as there are from
three to four hundred men every night
attending the different lodges and per
forming a duty that is beneficial to the
community at large, and as their wives
and families are kept in a constant state
of fear in their absence, we beg to sug
gest that If .there are not enough police
men to properly patrol the city the Chief
of Police would, in our opinion, have no
difficulty in securing from the different
fraternal organizations of this ctly suffi
cient aid necessary for that purpose. Be
it further
Resolved, That the continual increase
of depredations by the criminal classes
will make it necessary in the near future
for the fraternal organizations to form a
vigilance committee for their own pro
tection, which would be a reflection 'on
the "reform government" of this city. Be
It further
Resolved, That we condemn the finan
cial policy of this city that makes It
necessary to leave the streets In darkness
after 12 o'clock at night, thereby increas
ing the opportunities for robbery and oth
er crimes. ,
Respectfully submitted,

ported at the California-Street
Police Station.
Pickpockets and sneak thieves operated
in the crowds which congregated on the
corner, of Market and Third streets last
night, and among the valuables they se
cured was a $450 diamond and opal pin,
the loss of which was reported to the
California-street station. J. H. Turpln, a
wealthy resident of Lake View, Or., who
is stopping at the Brooklyn Hotel, was
watching the bulletins when he was sud
denly Jostled in several directions. As
soon as he recovered his equilibrium he
felt for his cravat pin and found that it
had been.deftly removed. The pin Is set
with an opal and nine diamonds. Turpin
can give no description of the thief.

Supervisors' Judiciary Committee to
Recommend an Ordinance Against
Freak 'Display.
An amended ordinance regulating the
height of fences of wood or other inflam
mable material within the city was sub
mitted yesterday to the Judiciary Com
mittee by Supervisor Brandenstein and
will be recommended for passage at next
Monday's meeting of the board. The orig
inal ordinance restricted the height of
fences to ten feet, but on the representa
tion of the Bill Posters' Association that
the ten-foot limit would ruin their busi
ness the committee decided to limit the
height to twenty feet. The ordinance pro
vides :
It shall be unlawful for any person, associa
tion or corporation to build or maintain, or to
suffer to be built or maintained, within the
city and county of San Francisco any fence of
wood or other Inflammable material over twenty
ffcet in height above the level of the sidewalk
without the permit of the Board of Fire War
dens (and or the Board of Public Works) of
the city and county of San Francisco first ob
tained. Kald Klre Wardens (and Board of Pub
lic Works) shall have power to grant such per
mit only if the said fence is built or main
tained as a wind-break or as a means to protect
the public from injury from any building or
other structure In the course of construction,
alteration or destruction, and will not be 'a
menace to life or property, nor Interfere with
the work of the Fire Department.
Section 2. Any fence built or maintained in
violation of the provisions of this ordinance is
hereby declared a public nuisance, and the
Chief of Police and the Chief Engineer of the
Fire Department are directed to abate the
same forthwith.
The ordinance regulating and restrict
ing advertising, which has been already
published, was also adopted. It provides
that it shall be unlawful for any person
or llrm to drive through the streets any
wagon carrying advertisements unless
said wagon be owned by a storekeeper or
corporation doing business and unless per
mission is obtained from the Board of
Public Works; also to propel any street
cars with advertisements printed on the
â¢outside of the car; to appear on- the
streets in extraordinary costume or dress
or by making any unusual noise; to paint
advertisements on gutterways, streets or
sidewalks or distribute any handbills or
dodgers for advertising purposes and to
appear on the streets carrying banners,
boards or placards with advertisements.
The committee decided to make certain
exceptions in the case of advertising by
labor organizations, but only when per
mission Is granted by the Board of Works.
WILL LIMIT ADVERTISING
FENCES TO TWENTY FEET
SN the sketch, "A Bluegrass Widow,"
which Milton Nobles is presenting at
the Orpheum this week, the actor
manager demonstrates the fact that
his versatility, as a writer is still as vig
orous a factor in his makeup as his ability
as a comedian. The new sketch is one of
the best turns on one of the best bills
ever presented at this playhouse. In the
little comedy there is not a line that drags
and from the moment the Bluegrass
widow and the innocent wife unfold their
scheme for awakening the conscience of
the derelict husband to the fall of the cur
tain interest is only interrupted by the
frequent laugh. . As usual, the "standing
room only" sign has been the most prom
inent feature after 8 o'clock outside the
Orpheum box office.
Milton Nobles has just been distinctive
ly honored by being elected to serve his
third term as the president of the Order
of Friendship, which is not widely known
among laymen, but in the theatrical world
it is one of the most highly respected or
ganizations. The Order of Friendship is
the only Masonic body in the profession
and includes among its members, past and
present, men who have made theatrical
history for the past fifty years. Every
distinguished actor in America to-day is
a member and the order's roster from the
beginning contains the names of the
world's most famous, thespians. Of the
charter members Joseph Jefferson and
John Ellsler are the only ones living. This
actor organization is one of the wealthiest
of its kind In the world and Mr. Nobles
considers his third term election one of
the most valued tributes he could receive
from his fellows of the sock and buskin.

and disturbing the peace, and was con
victed on both" by Judge Mogan yesterday.
He will be sentenced to-day.
SCHWERIN, PRESIDING GENIUS OF THE MAIL DOCK "HOTEL."
Henry Kusfeld, 111 Valparaiso street,
told a hard luck story in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday when he appeared to an
swer to a charge of petty larceny. If his
tale is found to be true the Judge will
dismiss the case against him.
About 7 o'clock Thursday morning
Frank Rhodes. 1616 Lyon street, notified
Policeman J. W. Sheehan that a man was
tearing up the sidewalk on Sacramento
street, between Steiner and Pierce. Shee
han found Kusfeld with five of the iron
coverings of hydrants which he had torn
from their fastenings. He was placed
under arrest on the charge of petty lar
ceny.
When asked "by the Judge what he had
to say in his defense Kusfeld said: "I
have been in this city six years, working
hard for a living. For the past two months
I have been unable to obtain work, and
as I have a sick wife and two children â
one two years old and the other eight
monthsâ starving at home I determined
that if I could not get work I would steal
for their sake; so I took the iron coverings
to get 25 cents for them to buy food. All
they had to eat yesterday was plain,
bread."
Kusfeld's appearance was in his favor
and the Judge was Impressed with his
story. He said he would take the case
under advisement till to-day and if Kus
feld's statements were correct he would
dismiss the case and lay the matter be
fore some charitable institution.
H. Kusfeld, a Laborer Out
of Work, Steals Rather
Than Starve.

Crime, He Pleads Poverty as

HUNGRY BABES
The Palatine Fire Insurance Company,
which has posed as on<? of the largest
end strongest of the British underwriters
doing business in this country, has been
absorbed by a rival concern and will
pass out cf existence. The announce
ment that its director* had reached an
agreement with the Commercial Union
Assurance Company of Ixmdon to assume
Its liabilities and take over its assets
reached this citv^ a few days ago and
created a flurry of excitement in Insur
ance circles.
While none of the details of the deal
are known here, it is stated that heavy
losses and disastrous business experiences
made the move necessary. The com
pany's "home office " liffurfs are not to be
had here ar.d consequently it is impossi
ble to form any i'iea of its financial con
dition. Its Pacific Coast manager,
C*har>s A. Lator.. state* that while he
believes the institution to be solvent, he
has no data upon which to base the opin
ion. Insurance Commissioner Clunie
eayÂ» that thÂ« "home" reports of the
company have net bÂ«en filed with him.
The United i~tat---f statements of the
Palatine for the pa-^t five yÂ«ars show that
the assets in this country have decreased
nearly $200.w0 durir.tr that period, while
the. loss ratio has increased from 56.9 per
cent In 3Â£9", to CT.T per cent in 1S93. The
expense of management has been from
Â£6 to 3& per cent, which has wiped out all
xaarEJn cf profits.
If the company ha* 'met with similar
experiences in all the fields in which it
has operated, retirement from business
trculd bÂ« the natural result.
ThÂ« Pacific Ccast ofiices of the concern
are at 433 California street. As soon as
the deal is completed the offices will be
closed and the business conducted over
the counters of the Commercial Union's
establishment here.
"The amalgamation of the two compa
nies le not yet an accomplished fact."
e&id Charles A. LÂ«iton. manager of the
Pacific Coast branch of the Palatine
Company yesterday, "but I have little
doubt that it will go through. A complete
agreement has been reached by the di
rectors of the two concerns, but Its rati
fication by the shareholders Is necessary.
I have no doubt that they will agree to
it. Our office hrre may be absorbed by
that of the Commercial Union. I have
received no information on that point.
"The present deal has been brought
about by the directors of the two compa
nies for the mutual benefit of both. The
Insurance losces last year and up to the
present time this year have been enor
mous. Our company made a loss of near
ly 6 per cent last year, and the losses up
to the present time this year are greater
than for the sam^ period during the pre
ceding twelve months.
"The Palatine ha-Â«= plenty cf assets in
this country, as our statement will show.
I have not the statement of our assets
in England for this year. It 1b in the
hands of Commissioner Clunie."
Mr. Clunie said that as far as America
was concerned, the Palatine Company
â¢was In good condition. He knew nothing
about Its financial condition at home, ana
taid that its main office statement had
not been filed with him.
Tte Coacerc's Assets Have Steadily
Decreased While Its Losses and
Expenses Have Been on
the Up Grade.
