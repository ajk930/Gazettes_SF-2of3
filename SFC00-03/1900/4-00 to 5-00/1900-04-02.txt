PLEDGES WERE BROKEN
Rumors of Friction With the TTnited
States Over the Hawaiian
Question.
Correspondence Associated Press.
YOKOHAMA. March 14.â The Emperor's
message of congratulation to Queen Vic
toria and her reply thereto have awak
ened, lively satisfaction In all quarters of
the empire and have emphasized the sym
pathy almost universally felt for the
British in the South African struggle.
.The death of Professor Toyama, an ex-
Minister of Education, removes one of
the best-known scholars of the realm and
will attract attention In the West, espe
cially in the United States, where his abil
ities were known. ,
It is reported that the Emperor will
shortly raise to the peerage Dr. Kentaro
Kaneko, the first of the Japanese to be
granted the honorary degree of LL. D. by
Harvard College. -
Judging from the strictures of -the na
tive-press there is fear of some friction
between Japan and the United States over
the Hawaiian question. There are now
some 60,000 Japanese in the islands. It Is
claimed that the United States is Ignoring
pledges given to the Japanese Government
at the time of annexation.
The visit of Professor Agasslz and his
scientific colleagues on the United States
Fish Commission steamer Albatross has
been the occasion of many social festivi
ties, conspicuous among them being a re

sity and the Japan Harvard Club.
The death of Consul General Gowoy.
which occurred yesterday, has awakened

Swift Advance Urged.
LONDON, April 2.â Spencer "Wilkinson,
in the Morning Post, says: "The attack
on Thaba Nchu and the convoy is a sam
ple of the mode in which the Boers will
to* to conduct the war. It is a legitimate
mode and the most effective for Boer pur
poses. So lons as the Boer army keeps
the field such attacks will embarrass the
British and perhaps the best way to *cet
rid of the difficulty would be a swift ad
vance and decisive blows against the main
Boer army."
PLAGUE HAS RUN ITS
COURSE IN HONOLULU
Herman Levy, Who Was Beported
HI With the Disease, Has
Recovered.
HONOLULU, March 24.â The Board of
Health has practically decided that tho
plague has run its course. No cases hava
developed for over a week. The member*
of the board now feel that quarantine re
strictions may be made less stringent.
Commencing with the 2Sth ail restrlctiona
regarding the shipment of merchandise
from Honolulu except merchandise from
Asiatic ports will be rescinded. Every
thing except Oriental goods is considered
cafe. It is not intended, however, that
there shall be any let-up of proper disin
fection of shipments or the supervision of
the matter by the Health Board.
Herman Levy, tht hotel clerk, who was
taken ill some weeks ago. has recovered
and will soon be about again. His caso
has not been officially declared one of
plague. As a matter of fact, some- of thÂ»
Board of Health physicians now admit
that the young man never had plague,
but, on the contrary, was 111 with typhoid
pneumonia.
ITALY ON THE VERGE
OF A REVOLUTION
King Humbert, Alarmed at the
Situation, Is Said to Be
in Hiding.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April I.â The Journal has
the following from Rome: It can no
longer be doubted that a dangerous condi
tion of unrest obtains throughout Italy.
This has existed for some time, but has
been brought to a head by the Govern
ment's attempt to pass a coercive meas
ure known as the "Public Safety bill."
This, under plea of suppressing riots, etc..
takes away the rights of free speech and
of public meetings. For six weeks the
Government has attempted to pass this
bill, despite the fierce opposition of the
Socialists and Republicans, which has now
developed into a dangerous revolutionary
movement.
The Italian Government strove to pass
this bill by empowering the President to
suppress opposition speakers, but sitting
was suspended daily owing to uproar and
fights, which Socialists and Republicans
started about a week ago. During the
discussion of the bill Slgnor Pantago
electrified the Chamber .by an impas
sioned appeal to the constituent assem
bly, which he demanded should be elected
by plebiscite, and he spoke also for reform
of the Italian constitution.
The King is so alarmed that he has not
been seen for several days. It is known
that Queen Margherita has implored him
to fly to Civlta Vecchia, and it Is believed
he has pone there to calm Margherita.
The people here are not allowed to mus
ter in crowds and everybody Is wonder
ing what will happen next.

WELLINGTON, N. Z., April I.â Tho exploring steamer Southern Cross, bearing 1 C. E. BoTchgTevink as 4 _t_tÂ»
survivors of the ' South Polar expedition fitted out in IS9S by Sir George Newnes of London, arrived to-day atCaxnp
belltown, near Bluff Harbor. N. Z. Mr. Borchgrevlnk reports that the magnetic pole has been located. N. H_aa
sen, one of the zoologists who started with the expedition, died on the voyage.-
The expedition left Hobart, Tasmania for the antarctic region on December 19, 1898. During the latter part
of February, 1599. the members landed from the Southern Cross near Cape Adair. Victorialand, it having been ar
ranged that the steamer should leave them there with full equipment of every kind and should return for them early la
TOO Mr Borchgrevink-s party consisted of nine. Including himself. Lieutenant W. Colbeck, R. N. 8.. was selected aa first
magnetic observer, to be assisted by Louis Bemacchi; X. Hansen and Hugh Evans were chosen aa zoologists
and Dr. H. Kloevstad as medical officer. Mr. Fougnal was general utility man and cook. -With these went two natives ot
Finland to look after ninety dogs. Enormous supplies of provisions were laid in.
NEW YORK April I.â What little has as yet been told of Herr Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevlnks discoveries la. the
South Polar Sea has been eagerly read, because, despite the general advance of discovery and exploration, the Antarctic
continent and Antarctic Ocean are still almost as unknown as they were centuries ago.
Borchgrevlnks' nrst voyage was made in ISD4. when he shipped as a common sailor on the Antarctic. On his return
he contributed a paper on "southern exploration that established his reputation as an explorer. On his former voyage he
was the nrst white man who had set foot upon the Antarctic continent since Captain Ross discovered it in IS4L
The recent expedition of Herr Borchgrevinks was organized in Norway and London, with the liberal assistance or
Sir George Newnes, and sailed from England in August, IS3S. One of the. objects of the expedition was to search for Ger
lache the Belgian explorer, who had gone on a trip to the southern contlnest a year before and of whom nothing had been
heard Another object was the. discovery of the southern magnetic pole, which he believed to be situated in latitude 75
degrees 5 minutes south and longitude 150 degrees east. He expected If he found himself able to land on the coast to
strike rapidly for the interior to locate this pole. â¢ "â,..,
Still a third object was the settlement of the controversy as to whether there was human lite on the continent.
â¢RnrrhExevinks believed there was. Ross discovered that seals killed on the coast of Antarctica had deep scars in their
fleVh arid supposed them to have been made by sea leopards. Borchgrevinks made a closer study of these scars and reach
ed' the conclusion that they were not made by teeth, but by weapons. They were never about the head, as they w^ild
have been had they been received in a fight, but were on the back and sides. From this he argued that there mus^ be
neople on the continent akin to. the Eskimos of the northern Islands. . ' ?._,â,_
His expedition left Hobart, Tasmania, on December 10, IS9S. During the latter part of February members landed from
the Southern Cross near Cape Adare, Victoria Land, on the Antarctic continent. There the party was left and the ship
was to return for them this year.
MUCH SICKNESS AMONG
THE BOER PRISONERS
CAPE TOWN. March 31.â The departure

prisoners for St. Helena has been delayed
in consequence of the sickness among the

Many of General Cronje"s men when cap

Ultimately Failed. '
LOS ANGELES, April I.â A climax
was reached to-day in the "Mar
ceau conflict for the possession of
Baby Theo Jr. Mrs. Amanda Mar
ceau-Fennell, mother of the child,
attempted to quietly leave this city with
the youngster, her son, Allen Fiske. and
her faithful maid, but they had proceeded
but a short distance on their northern
journey when the colonel discovered that
he had been outgeneraled and headed off
the fleeing quartet by means of a tele
graphed warrant for their arrest. Allen
Fiske was taken from the train at
Lancaster, a small station In this
county, but the rest of the party were

#Â¦-__! _a
When Colonel Marceau repeatedly de
manded during yesterday and this morn-
Ing that Baby Marceau be brought to his
gallery, and requested that he be left
with him to pass the night. Mrs. Mar
ceau told her friends that she feared she
would never again see her boy and deter
mined to go to her home in San Fran
cisco while she had him In her pos
session.
Her departure was planned quietly and
executed with the greatest secrecy. At a
little past noon she and her family walked
through the hotel where she had apart
ments, entered a carriage and drove to
the depot.
About forty minutes before she left the
hotel Mrs. Marceau. in response to a tele
phone request from the colonel. Informed
him that the boy was well and that she
would let him know later when he would
be taken to the gallery.
When the colonel discovered that Sirs.
Marceau had left the city he sought Sher
iff W. H. Hammel. who, through Mar
ceau's attorney, Clarence A. Miller, di
rected Constable Harry J. Butler by wire
at Lancaster to board the train and de
mand the child. This was done. With a
woman's wit Mrs. Marceau asked whether
giving up the child would require her
presence in Los Angeles. Being Informed
In the negative, she said:
"Well, If that Is the case, here Is the
boy." And the Constable, as the train
steamed north, marched away with Al
len Fiske. The boy still remains with the
Lancaster officer. When this- clever ruse
was made known In Los Angeles further
proceedings were taken. Through coun
sel a complaint was drawn, charging Mrs.
Marceau with felony and theft in the
taking away of Theo C. Marceau Jr. This
complaint was wired at 8 o'clock to-night
to Sheriff Borgwardt at Bakersfleld. and
upon the arrival of the northbound train
Mrs. Marceau was arrested and held.
Sheriff Hammel has been Informed that
Mrs. Marceau and her boy will \be re

Having Her Arrested.
Special DiÂ«patch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD. April I.â When the
north-bound Southern Pacific overland
reached this city at 9 o'clock this evening
Sheriff Borgwardt and deputies met it to
arrest Mrs. Amanda J. Fennell, otherwise
Mrs. Colonel Marceau. on a warrant Is
sued out of Justice W. P. James' court. In
Los Angeles, charging her with child
stealing. Mrs. Fennell objected strongly
to leaving her compartment in the Pull
man, and a number of gentlemen In the
car offered to assist her, until Sheriff
Borgwardt called upon them to assist
him, showing them the warrant he held
signed by Sheriff Hammel of Los Angeles
County.
Mrs. Fennell would not leave the car
until her baggage was seized and her
companion, Martha Frenzell, also cus
todian of the child In contention,' was
lifted out with little Theodore Marceau.
Then she consented to go and was as-
i . Â¦
t stated to a carriage and driven to the
Southern Hotel. She accepted the situa
tion gracefully and Sheriff Borgwardt al
lowed her to accompany The Call corre-
Fpondent to a telephone office, where ?he
communicated with friends In San Fran-
I cisco relative to her situation.
Concerning the probable reason for Colo
nel iMarceau's action in causing her arrest,
-Vrs. Fennell said: "I am entirely at a
loss to know why he should act this way."'
And then, with a flash of anger, "Possibly
he Is drunk."
Continuing, she said: "I dined with the
colonel only Saturday evening. I was with
him from S o'clock until 12, and when I
left him he was in a complaisant mood
and agreed fully that baby Theodore
should go with me and Martha. When [
got ready to leave Los Angeles Sunday
noon I telephoned the colonel, bidding him
good-by, shortly before train time, and he
interposed no objection then.
"My surprise was very great when an
officer boarded our train at a town called
Lancaster and arrested my boy, Allen
Fiske, and took him from the train. He
is only 12 years old. and I should have fol
lowed him only that I was so stunned by
the occurrence that the train was in mo
tion before I realized what was happen
ing. I telegraphed at other 6tatlons; It
would do me no good to get off the train
then, but it was not until I reached
Bakersfleld that I learned that he would
be sent after me â In fact, that he was the
wrong boy. I am glad the country Con
stable at Lancaster was so stupid, as he
left me little Theodore, who was the one
they wanted.
"I consider the treatment I have been
subjected to as simply outrageous. Sher
iff Borgwardt has shown me every con
sideration, but I am utterly unable to see
how It Is possible to apprehend me, my
child and the guardian the courts have
appointed for my child. They tear my son
away from me at one station and take me
from It by force at another, and now they
are to take me back to Los Angeles, just
to please that miserable old man, who
doesn't in the least know what he is do
ing."

special from Washington says: Hon.
Webster Davis of Kansas City will to
morrow tender his resignation to the
President as Asslsuan. Secretary of the
Interior. Mr. Davis decided to take this
course as the result of his visit to South
Africa. He has decided to deliver a pub
lic address touching the entire scope of
the present war and believes that he can
best do so while free from any restraint
which his present position would impose
upon him.
When taking his departure for home
from Pretoria 2000 persons gathered to
take leave of him at the station. They
appealed to him in tears to state their
cause to the American people and Mr.
Davis says his conscience would haunt
him If he proved recreant to that pitlfu'
apr><*al.
He believe* the American people are
not truly informed on the situation. He
will, therefore, avail himself of an early
opportunity to relate his experiences and
observations at a public meeting that
shall be free to all. Mr. Davis has decided
on this course after mature deliberation
end free consultation with his friends.

and a force of mounted infantry, under Colonel Pilcher, which had been garrisoning
Thaba N'chu, was obliged, in consequence of the near approach of a large force of Boers,
to leave last night.
Colonel Broadwood marched to the Bloemfontein water works, south of the Modder,
where he encamped at 4 o'clock this morning. At early dawn the camp was shelled by the
enemy from a near point. Colonel Broadwood sent off a convoy with the batteries, while
the rest of the force remained to act as a rear guard. The convoy arrived at a deep spruit,
where the Boers were concealed, and the entire body walked into ambush and was cap
tured, together with six guns.
The loss of life was not great, since most of the British had walked into the trap be

Dr. B. F. Shaw Slain by
John W. McKimm, His
Brother-in-Law.
Assassin Attempts to Kill an En
tire Family in Order to
Avenge Imaginary
Wrongs.
KANSAS CITY, April I.â Harboring
imaginary wrongs John W. McKlmm,
aged 29 years, this afternoon shot and
killed Dr. B. F. Shaw, his brother-in
law, as the latter sat reading the Sun
day-school lesson to his live-year-old
daughter. Dr. Shaw died instantly. Mc-
Kimm, who had been an inmate of a sani
tarium and is believed to be insane,
threatened to kill the other five mem
bers of the family and was restrained
only after a struggle.
Dr. Shaw was a widower. His mother
in-law, Mrs. McKlmm, had cared for his
child since his wtfe died, and, as was his
custom, he spent Sunday at the McKlmm
house at 1617 Forest avenue. The family
had eaten dinner. Shaw seated himself in
a chair in the parlor and with his child be
fore him on the floor was readng the Sun
day-school lesson to her. McKlmm, as
it "developed later, had gone directly to
his room from the table and written a
rambling statement, in which he stated
that he had not been treated rightly, and
tha the Intended wiping out the entire
family, consisting of Dr. Shaw and his
child, his mother, two brothers and a sis
ter. Then descending to the parlor he
slipped up behind Shaw and placing the
revolver against the latter's temple flred.
Dr. Shaw never moved and died before
the family could reach his side. As the
other members of the family came run
ning to the scene McKimm raised his re
volver to fire at the first that should en
ter the room, but before he could tire he
was overpowered by his two brothers and
taken .to the station. He has been con
sidered of unsound mind for several years
and was discharged from a local sanitar
ium two years ago as cured. Recently,
however, he had acted queerly.

THE CLEVELAND
ADRIFT WITH A
BROKEN SHAFT
History of the Steamer Is
One Long Chapter of
Accidents.
Was Bound From Hawaii for This
Port With a Cargo of Sugar and
Her Location Is a Matter
of Conjecture.
?
HONOLULU, March 21.â The steamer
Cleveland, Captain Klltgard. is adrift
with a broken shaft several hundred
miles from Maul. She was bound
for San Francisco, with a full cargo of
sugar from Kahulul when she was ren
dered helpless by the breaking of the
shaft. One of her boats, with three men,
started for Maul to get assistance, and at
last reports was forty miles away from
Maul, south by east. Where the steamer
is is not easy to say, and it will be no
easy matter to find her.
The news of the Cleveland's plight was
brought here by the steamer Eric, which
arrived Wednesday off the harbor, stop
ping here on her way to Japan on account
of the illness of the captain's wife. Tues
day the Eric spoke a small boat forty
miles from Maul. There were three men
in It. They informed Captain Roos of the
Eric that they were from the Cleveland
and were going to Maul to get assistance
for the steamer, which had broken her
shaft and wns practically helpless In the
open sea.
The men in the boat stated that the
Cleveland when they left her was 320 miles
north-northwest of the Island of Maul.
The little boat had traveled 2SO miles of
the Journey to Maul, "a trip that must
have required several days, so that the
Cleveland must have moved a good deal
since she was last located. She has two
yards and can put up a little sail, but
not enough to control her movements. If
she lost her propeller, as she would If her
shaft broke near the end, she could be
more easily controlled with sails than
with the propeller dragging astern. * .
The Cleveland left Kahulul on the 12th,
It is thought. She had 19,100 bags of sugar
on board. She was about two days' dis
tant from port .when the small boat left
her, so that it wouhl seem that the acci
dent must have occured on thel4th, and
the little boat must have been six days
on the way when it was spokon by the
Eric. If this is the.case the Cleveland had
time to drift a long way before any as
sistance could go to. her, and her plight is
very serious. If she was directly In line
on the San Francisco route she might be
picked up by the Australia.
Captain Saunders of the pilot-house
thinks it likely. In view of the weather
that has prevailed, that the Cleveland Is
northwest of Maul Instead of northeast.
! The news of her difficulty was communi
cated to him by the captain of the Eric.
The Cleveland has something of a repu
tation as a hoodoo. She has been in a
number of scrapes and has been the sub
ject of much controversy, as to her fitness
for sea.
During the Civil War the Cleveland was
a blockade runner and was captured on
one of her trips to Charleston. She was
built in IS6I, and has Feen service of all
kinds all over the world. Her name, has
been changed many times. Lately she
was used as a transport for the Philip
pines, after a Jot of controversy as to
whether she was seaworthy.
Alexander & Baldwin began to look for
a steamer to send after the Cleveland as
soon as they received news of her plight.
The search for her may be a long Job, and
only the largest of the Island steamers
are fit for the work. The Kinau or Claud
ine are best fitted for the contract. The
Claudine has been: at Maul and may pos
sibly have gone on thÂ» â¢ search already,
though she very likely left for Honolulu
before the three men from the Cleveland
got to Maul.
The steamer with her cargo of sugar is
worth over 9100,000, so that there is big
salvage for any steamer that picks her
up. The Australia would probably refuse
to tow her. as taking a tow would be a
violation of the mail contract.
DUBLIN, April I.â "Bedad. and it's

sidering the conditions they have had to
light, l'ljt'lr aim has been to make the
city c^ean and keep it dean: This is the
last thing the masses ot Filipinos and
Chinamen propotc to do unless driven
to It.
"ihpy don't understand it; they con
sider it only a lorm of persecution," ex
plained Burgeon Major Ira C. Brown when
asKed if u,c ::ati\e.> were disposed to co
operate in this r/ork. :*i."he Filipinos are
one of the most scrupulous people in the
world about personal cifanliness, and one
01 tne *ight;< or me country is to see the
whole population getting under the pumps
and Into th'; rivers anu canals at sunrise.
Their clothing also is most spotless white.
Their knowledge or sanitation; however,
was gained entirely from the Spaniards
and is defective, i'lit- lower classes ot
Chinese are worse, as the fact that two
thirds of the plague cases have been
among them; altoough they number but a
small minority of the population, testi
fies. White people have escaped alto
gether, but through no virtue on the part
of certain nationalities. Manila is prac
tically without sewerage, and because of
its low level tlie cost of a system on mod
ern lines would be almost prohibitive. As
an offset is the character Of the nipa huts
inhabited by most of the natives, which
stand on posts above the ground free
tr^rn rats and well ventilated.
Troubles of Health Officers.
The plague i.s supposed to have begun in
Cavite. it nrat appeared in Manila in the
walled cay. only v stone's throw from
j tl>e palace where army headquarters are,
j and three persons were dead before the
j nature <.>! iiieir disfa.se was suspected.
i liost <jf the later cases have been in the
; same section of the walled city or in the
: Chinese quarter near the water front.
: immediately burgeon Major Edie. the
I health uiucvr, organized a force of in
| tspectors to enforce rigid sanitary meas
j urts oh everybody, and the plague work
| was put m coarse oi Major Brown. It
was necessary u> have men who could
speak the language or the people, explain
to them what the inspections meant and
direct them how to Keep their premises
d fj"i. fo fcilipinoa bad to be enlisted.
The race question created complica
tions immediately. Between Filipinos and
Chinamen there exists an inveterate
hatred. It was harÂ«l to find natives will
ing to serve who couid understand and
cuter into the spirit of the crusade and
balder to enforce honesty and fmpartial
*, lv .. a P lon S them. The Filipino inspectors
delighted in the chance to square grudges
against their traditional enemies. They
proceeded to file a batch of warrants for
maintaining,, nuisances at police head
quarters, and must <^f them wtrre against
Chinamen, who proved oa investigation
to t>e the most j>ro*-.intnt and least of
fending of their race.
Help came irom an unexpected quarter
for the rich Chinese merchanxs, under
the leadership of Palanka, the forme--
Consul General and the chief magnate
among them, offered to furnish thirty in
spector* to worft among their countrymen
and keep the Chinese reasonably clean.
The Chinamen in the Philippines are or
ganized into societies?; each society has
Us head men, taxes are levied and laws
enforced by them and there is practically
tt secret government with Palanka at its
head. Intelligent Chinamen know tha
horrors of the plague from experience,
and when they assured the offirials that
they would co-operate and use their power
with the lower classes to combat their
prejudices then- offer was gladly accepted.
1 here are now 100 inspectors at work In
Manila, thirty of them Chinamen and the
others Filipinos. They are sent out in
squads, usually two Filipinos and a Chi
naman, with a soldier to boss them and
see that they do their work and abstain
from blackmailing. Major Brown and the
officers of the Health Department boss
the soldiers and the inspectors. When
ever a plague victim is discovered he is
sent to the Chinese or the Filipino hospi
tal if it is possible to move him. The
house is thoroughly disinfected, a bontlre
is made of everything movable, a yellow
placard announcing "bubonic peste" ap
pears on the door, while a sentry stands
guard to keep people away. Four days
the house is kept closed and the inmates
are isolated. When two or three cases
develop in one street the street is barred
against business.
The dead Chinamen are buried In a
grave eight feet deep in the Chinese ceme
tery and covered with lime. The bodies
of Filipinos are burned when the rela
tives will consent. Cremation is desirable
for all. but the Chinese superstitions are
so strong against burning their dead that
any attempt to emorce it would result In
concealment of the cases and possibly
riots. The estimate of 200 deaths includes
the probable number of cases which have
been kept from the knowledge of the au
thorities. It has been hard to Induce the
Chinese and natives to forego public fu
ncraJs. One hearse is kept for Chinese
plague victims, another for Filipinos. In
deed, the greatest diplomacy has been
necessary to induce the Chinamen to take
any precautions. Without the co-opera
tion of the "head men" it would have
been Impossible. Chinamen even appear
In court against their neighbors and Chi
nese Inspectors swear against their own
countrymen, which is without precedent
In the courts of Manila. Major Brown
says: "We can make the Chinamen un
derstand what it means to clean up their
places, but they cannot understand that
they must keep cloanâ that they must re
peat the process every day."

ago Con.--tr.ble George Agncw, on making
his usual visit to the fishermen's camp at
Point San Pedro, was notltied of the awful
fate which was being meted <<ut to the

terrible position.
For many months th* rival tongs have

Ow Yongj This on** company is the Suey
Wo, and threats and coaxing on the part
of King Ow Yonpr have alike failed to in
duce them to join the shrimp combine,
which it is the ex-Vice Consul's desire to
control. About a month ago several Chi
namen wer*- smuggled into the country by
way of Tom&iea Hay. These men were all
recruits to Kins Ow Vong's forces, and
th<- raid in* which they were captured and
subsequently deported was made by the
officers on information lodged with them
by a prominent member of the Suey Wo
Company. This intensified the ill-feeling
toward the Suey Wos and a proclamation
was posted in all the camps warning all
spies and informers that if apprehended
tnev would bâ¬ dealt with In a Â« ur n" ar X

immediately, aa a worse fate would un
doubtedly have been his if his vengeful
compatriots had again laid hands on him.
Although an effort is being made to cap

delivered by Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth
to the converts in stripes, and although

of "Volunteers."

tion by the prison quartet. This was fol
lowed by some remarks by Chaplain
Drahms. Mrs. Booth, who Is styled by
the convicts "Little Mother," then deliv
rrpd an address, in which she bade the
prisoners to "look up and hope." Chap
lain Drahms, after a hymn, pronounced
the benediction. After the services Mrs.
Booth held a reception and talked to all
the convicts desiring an interview. Fully
SOO prisoners were present and listened
to the services. Warden Aguirre, as a
precautionary measure, had doubled the
guards in the chapel, but so Interested

MRS. "JACK" GARDNER
MAKES A DIRE THREAT
Will Go to Europe to Live if She Is
Compelled to Pay Duty on Her
Art Collection.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April I.â "lf I am not to bring
my pictures into this country without
having to pay half tb~ price I originally
paid for them, I shall go to Europe to
live," said Mrs. "Jack" Gardner to The
Call correspondent at her home on Beacon
street to-day.
"The tariff laws of the United States on
the importing of pictures, statues and
other works of art are, in my estimation,
due to Ignorance on the part of the people
who have made these laws, and to-day
America stands alone in her opposition to
the Importation of the works of the old
masters. My collectionâ l mean the one
I nave in Europeâ ls said there to be one
of tho iinest private collections in the
world, and composing it are pictures
which any museum would pay vast sums
to possess. I feel very keenly over this
question and over the question of ! the
tariff, and I cannot understand why a
country, whose ideas on most things are
so advanced as are those of America,
should put a prohibitive tariffâ a penalty,
in other words â on those things which
England. Russia, France, Spain and Italy
are paying out fabulous amounts to ac
quire."
This Is the recorded protest that Mrs.
"Jack" Gardner has made against the
stringency of tho tariff regulations. Re
cently, when she was planning to Import
an Italian palace, Mrs. Gardner spoke bit
terly on the si.nie subject.

INTERESTING STATISTICS
BEARING ON IMPORTS
Sugar, Coffee, Hides and Skins, Wool,
Fruits and Tea Head the List
in Value.
"WASHINGTON, April I.â An interesting
statement showing the sources of the ag
ricultural Imports of the United States
during the five fiscal years ISD4-9S has
been prepared by Frank H. Hitchcock,
chief of the foreign markets section of
the Agricultural Department.
During the five fiscal years ISDI-9S the
agricultural Imports of the United States
had an average annual value of $3C5,745,
457. Sugar, coffee, hides and skins, wools,
silk, vegetable fibers, fruits and tea wore
the articles imported most extensively.
Measured in value, these items formed
over four-fifths of our total import trade
in agricultural products for the period
mentioned, their combined value aggre
gating about $300,000,000 aÂ» year. Of this
sum more than one-half was paid for
two commoditiesâ sugar and coffee. The
average yearly value of the sugar imports
for 1K:Â«4-&S amounted to $90,418,685, and cof
fee $83,570,106.
Although the total value of the agri
cultural imports amounted to only W14,
201,7'.'6 In I^9S. as compared with $364,133,027
In' 1834, a considerable increase was re
corded from several of the leading
sources of supply. Japan, China and the
Hawaiian Islands afforded the most strik
ing instances of a growing trade. The
value of the agricultural products im
ported from Japan rose l'rnm $14,1(35,637 in
IR!H to $20.2G5,354 in IS9S; China from $14,
"S2 539 to $18,346,474. and the Hawaiian Isl
ands from $10,202,331 to $17,H2,505.

INDICTMENTS
EXPECTED IN
GOEBEL CASE
The Grand Jury Will Return
True Bills Against a
Number of Suspects.
Prosecution Claims That the Dragnet
Will Pick Up Many Who Have
Not Been Heretofore
Involved.
Â«
FRANKFORT, Ky.. April I.â The con
vening of the April term of the Frank
lin Circuit Court to-morrow, with Judge
Cantril sitting, marks the beginning of
the final legal proceedings against the al
leged assassin of the late Governor Goe
bel, and on this account makes it the
most important in the history of criminal
trials In this State in many years.
The Grand Jury will be in order to
work on Tuesday and the assassination
case will be the nrst matter taken up. It
is understood that Commonwealth's At
torney Franklin, who will conduct the
prosecution on the part of the State, had
nad subpenaes Issued for numerous im
portant witnesses in rotation, and others
will be issued as soon as the court gets
duwn to work, if the prosecution makes
good its claims, the investigation will in
rolve a large number of others against
whom indictments will be returned. The
general impression prevails that none of
the trials will come up at the present
term, and it is understood that the de
fense probably In every case will move
for a change of venue to some other
county.
Colonel T. C. Campbell, special counsel
for the prosecution, was in conference
with Henry Youtsey, one of the men ar
rested, for a long time at the Jail this
afternoon. Colonel Campbell declined to
state what parsed at the conference. The
attorneys for the prosecution persistently
claim they have more damaging evidence
against Youtsey, connecting him with the
crime, than against any or thu others so
fur arrested, and it is said that the state
ment made by Culton has strengthened
thÂ«- case against him. Republican leaders
profess to not know the plans of Repub
lican Governor Taylor, but it is generally
believed be will not return here till the
action of the Grand Jury is made public
if he returns at all soon, and in this opin
ion Democrats and Republicans coincide.

SPRING SESSION OF THE
MEXICAN CONGRESS OPENS
In His Message President Diaz Tells
of the Friendliness Exhibited
by This Country.
CITY OF MEXICO, April I.â President
Diaz opened the spring session of Con
gress this evening. In his message Presi
dent Diaz calls attention to the satisfac
tory termination of the suits entered in
New York against Mexico by the Wood
house bond claimants at the time the
Morgans issued the Mexican loan. He
says that not for a moment did he recog
nize that Mexico could be sued in a for
eign court, and that the American high
est courts sustained this principle. The
President reviews the Weil and Abra case,
which the American courts , decided so
satisfactorily for Mexico, displaying no
table impartiality. He says Mexico will
take pleasure in welcoming the Pan-
American Congress.
The new treaty of commerce and friend
ship between Mexico and China will soon
be sent to the Senate for ratification. The
President dwelt on the precautions taken
to prevent the spread of yellow fever in
Vera Cruz and on the Gulf Coast, and de
nies that the bubonic plague has made it 3
appearance in Mexican territory.
A great increase in copper mining is
mentioned, and antimony, lead and other
minerals formerly not regarded with in
terest now command the attention of en
terprising miners, backed by large capi
tal. Colonization makes progress. The
harbor works at Vera Cruz and else
where are making excellent progress, the
postal receipts continually increase, and
there has been a similar gain in the serv
ice of the Federal telegraph. Gratifying
conditions of finance enables the executive
to carry out many works of public im
provement authorized by Congress. The
army is In good condition and is being
Improved in many branches of the serv
ice. The President says the Yaqui war
is not likely to be prolonged. It Is the
intention of the Government to send the
Yaqui prisoners to different parts of the
republic and have them instructed In the
arts of civilization. ..Decisive measures
against the rebellious Maya Indians are !
now under way and new flotilla will op- I
crate in coniunction with the army
against these Indians. The message gives
general satisfaction, as showing un
checked progress of the nation in every
branch of the service.
Boer Peace Envoys Now on Their Way to Europe.
Mr. Wolmarans is a member of the Executive Council of the Transvaal
and a most trusted confidant of President Kruger. Mr. Fisher has been State
Secretary and member of the Council of the Orange Free State, and while
formerly a strong advocate of peace, stands very close to President Steyn
and for the absolute independence of the two republics.
The two envoys with their retinue are expected to arrive any day in
Europe. Just what is the purport of their instructions and tha extent of
their powers is of course not yet known.

Recently Involved in a Sharp Contro
versy With Cardinal Vaughan
Over Certain Magazine
Articles.
â¢LONDON, April I.â Dr. St. George Miv
art, former lecturer on zoology at St.
Mary's Hospital Medical School and pro
fessor of biology at the University of Lu
vain, long recognized as the leading
scientist within the Roman Catholic
church In England, is dead.
The late Dr. Mivart was recently in
volved in a sharp controversy with Car
dinal Yaujihan. Archbishop of Westmin
ster, growing out of certain articles he
had contributed to the Nineteenth Cen
tury and Fortnightly Review. He had de
manded from tlie Cardinal, as proprietor
of the Tablet, the principal Roman Cath
olic organ in London, an apology for a
personal attack made upon him in that
paper. The Cardinal replied that the
matter was entirely one for adjustment
between the editor of the Tablet and Dr.
Mivart. as he was responsible for neither
the language nor the arguments of the
Tablet.
This was the subordinate feature of the
controversy. Its principal feature in
volved Dr. Mivart's views as the Inspira
tion of the Scriptures.
A t-ensational article by Professor Miv
art appears in the April North American
Review, in which he says that the recep
tion by Cardinal Vaughan of his maga
zine articles showed the Roman church
"to be essentially a petrified and not a
progressive church."
Continuing, Professor Mivart says he
was called upon to declare his belief in
certain books of the Bible. He said:
It was. of course, absoltely Impnunlble for
me or W other scientillc m n to sign such a
formula; unless it wa= clearly and publicly
known that I should be free to reject, as
errors, (statements, historically untrue, such as
the account of the eerpent and th<? tree, the
brinsrinc of the animals to Adam to be named,
the history of the tower of Babel, that of the
dt-lucf, and 60 on.
Professor Mlvart believed there were er
rors in the Bible and he wrote to his
Cardinal, asking if by signing the for
mula referring to the books he would be
hound to accept everything Biblical as
fact. In explanation he said:
It is very noteworthy that I could get no
authoritative answer from the Cardinal. The
fflf-t was he dared not answer. He could not
alloy that God had Insrired men to write false
hoods, or that the church had (as of course it
has) misled mankind- as to the word of God
for a long succession of centuries.
She Was Famous for Years as One
of the Most Beautiful Women
on the Pacific
Coast.
>
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 1.-Mra. Catherine
Jordan, famous for years as one of the
handsomest women on the Pacific Coast,
was found dead to-day In her apartments
at No. 305 West Forty-second street. The
gas was turned on.
She was a daughter of Colonel Alfred
Andrews, a wealthy dealer in precious
stones in San Francisco, whose place of
business is known as the "Diamond Pal
ace." Mrs. Jordan had been twice mar
ried, and both husbands are dead. Her
son, Wilton E. Berolzhimer, who lived
with her, is an old friend of James J.
Corbett and the night manager of the lat
tcr's saloon in Upper Broadway.
When lierolzhime left the house on Sat
urday night to go on duty his mother
stemed to be in her usual spirits, lie
did not return until 1 o'clock yesterday
afternoon. There was a strong odor of
gas in the house, and he found his mother
in an inner room on a bed. There were
two tasjets in the rodm and both were
turned on. A doctor was summoned, who
pronounced the woman dead from gas
asphyxiation.
Berolzhimc* said his mother had been
suffering from extreme nervousness.
Three \>eeks ago she secreted all of her
Jewelry, which she valued highly, in an
upper drawer of a chiffonier. When she
went to look for them they had disap
peared. She believed burglars had taken
them and that she had had a narrow es
cape from them, and was shocked and
frightened as a result. The jewels were
found throe days later in the bottom of
a chiffonier, and it was discovered they
had sifted through a crevice in the back
of a drawer.
Mrs. Jordan soon afterward pricked her
thumb with a brass pin. Blood poisoning
set in and her entire hand and arm
swelled to twice their ordinary size. Mrs.
Jordan went to Koosevelt Hospital and
was advised that her condition was seri
ous and that she had better remain. She
had a horror of hospitals and returned
home last Tuesday against the advice of
physicians. Her arm was getting worse,
and this, added to her anxiety about the
supposed burglary, her son believes, drove
her to take her life.
Mrs. Jordan was 49 years old and still
retained her beauty. She was a blonde of
striking figure, perfect complexion and
large blue eyes of wonderful depth and
luster.
The news of the death of Mrs. Jordan
has nearly prostrated her father. He
maintains that there can be no thought of
suicide, for only Saturday he received
from his daughter a letter that showed
her to be in the best of spirits and appar
ently without a thought of taking her
life. He saya Mrs. Jordan has been in
the habit of taking morphine to relieve
neuralgia, and ho is sure her death is
traceable to that drug. She has been sub
ject to neuralgia for years, he said, and
she has been taking morphine right along.
She was out lure a little more than a
year ago, and she was in fair health then
and certainly did not appear despondent.
Colonel Andrews has just recovered from
a serious illness, and as a consequence the
news of his daughter's death affects him
with added severity.
Mrs. Jordan was well known In this
city, where she was a reigning belle.
About thirty years ago she married a man
named Berolzhime and went East to live.
She was separated from him some years
later and afterward married Jordan.

SUBSIDY BILL
Committee on Merchant Ma
rine Presents Its
Report.
Â» Â¦ Â¦
Primary Object of the Measure to In
crease the Shipping Fleet and
to Expand the Trade of
This Country.
?
"WASHINGTON, April I.âRepresenta
1 tive Grosvenor of Ohio, chairman of the
House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries, presented to the House yes
terday the amended shipping bill and the
report in its support by the majority of
the committee, constituting all the Repub
lican members. The report says, in part:
Our abundant natural resources and our In
dustries and increasing; population make It of
great value to increase the means of profitably
disposing of our surplus productions, and as
our export trade is Increased, co will be borne
consumption and employment.
Our exporting competitors have for a. long
time been devoting- themselves to increasing
their export trade and getting possession of
the markets. Africa Is an example of the
methods pursued in partitioning territory or
recognizing "spheres of influence." Possibly
Eastern Asia Is eventually destined to receive
eimitar treatment.
China may be left open to fair and equal
competition with respect of trade with the
United States, in which event one of the larg
est. If not tha largest, field for trade and com
merce of other nations will be open to those
possessing the facilities of taking advantage
of opportunity. The nation first in the field,
with its own production and its own means of
transportation, will achieve the largest suc
cess. ,
: The need of establishments for the construc
tion, dockins and repairing of ships, and ade
quate navy and a gTeat fleet of merchant ves
sels, all In readiness for any emergency. Is a
self-evident proposition.
After giving the statistics on the extent
of tonnage the world over, the cost of
subsequent buildings, wages, etc., Mr.
Grosvenor's report Bums up the "cardinal
purposes" of the bill as follows:
1. To aid in a practical wayâ and no doubt
under existing conditions the only possible
wayâ in bringing to the greatest extent pos
sible our own foreign trade back into our own
hands, and thus saving to our country annu
ally what now goes to increase the wealth of
other nations more than $100.<Xh),000.
2. To greatly increase the exportation and
fale of all kinds of our superabundant pro
ductions and especially in the vast regions of
Asia, evidently very soon to be opened to the
trade of the world.
8. To bring into existence at the earliest pos
sible time a great American fleet of American
vessels, built in our own country.
4. To increase the number of citizens who
will be educated in seafaring work and who
will thus have the skill and be better able to
defend the honor and integrity of our country
on the seas, however suddenly the occupation
may happen.
5. The bill, we think, will. If the proposed
compensation Is large enough, accomplish
these great and important purposes.
General Grosvenor's report concludes:
It will, of course, take a considerable time
to reach the desired end, but the sooner the
policy is entered upon the sooner am] easier
will be its accomplishment. The means pro
posed are open to the capital, the enterprise
and the skill of our citizens alike and en equal
terms. There is no ground for the form of
monopoly. There is absolute safety to the
treasury In the fact that no payment can be
made until In raeh and for each voyajco the
work Is actually performed. A* we have be
fore stated, it Is certain that no vessel, great
or small, fast or plow, in the list can afford to
make a single voyage without also having a
large commercial business Income from the
same voyage and In doing which commercial
business she Is fulfilling the great purpose of
the bill. In view of the foregoing considera
tions we earnestly recommend the speedy pass
age of the bill.
The bill and amendments have been
made public heretofore. The anti-trust
amendment is slightly changed, so that In
case of combination those participating In
if are excluded from the benefits of the
bill, instead of the previous plan, which
would have operated alike against those
in and out of the combination.

PALO ALTO, April Lâ To the Public: The undersigned, representing the
University of California and Leland Stanford Jr. University, feel that the
efforts of the people of Pa!u Alto to bring to justice those concerned in the
recent abduction of a Chinese girl at Palo Alto deserve the support of all ciU
zens of the Htate. They desire hereby to express their approval of such ef
forts. That officers of justice ehould take part in such an affair is a blot upon
the reputation <Â»f the State.

EALO ALTO. April I.â A meeting of
the executive committee appointed
by the roafs-n.eeting last night was
heM In Recorder Norris" oflice this
evening. Professor Whittier. Rev. Mr.
GBXflener and Professor Smith presented
a resolution Figr.cd by Acting President
Brenner ar.d President Wheeler indorsing
the public movement to suppress the
f-lave trsiKc in Chinese girls. Justice
Dyer, irtth his attorney, Joseph Hutch-
Inson. appeared before the committee and
asked the privilege of making a etate
cte&t.
Mr. Hutchinscn read a carefully pre
pared paper, denying all complicity in the
j :an to abduct the grirl. ar.d makes a bid

the basis of being made the tool of de- j
rigning parties, lie offt-rs to aid the com- j

called en. He thinks now things were
not just right, az.d practically offer* to J
resign if the case is .Jrup;>ed. The com- i
roittte received the communication la si- j
lence. Dyer presents through Hutcbinson
smother docamcr.t r>-ri>ortins to be a clean t
breast of all the facts In his possession, j
He claims he was notified that the girl
Â¦would be en the train after dark and
vent to meet the girl and Mies Cameron
at his office. He did not see the girl again i
until he ma her en the county road at j
I
I 2:30 in the morning. He denies ordering
the jail broken open. He went driving
and met the tprl and Harris and the
Chinamen.
Harrington, a San Jose attorney, ad-
I vised him that it was regular and proper
I to hold court at that tin;e and place and
I swore in one Chinaman vi interpreter.
I The Interpreter Baid the girl wanted to
! plead guilty to a charge ol petty larceny.
He accepted the ftau-ment, lined the girl
J5 and turned her over to the Chinamen.
v.-lio drove away. He blnn-.es Harrington
j and Harris for giving him bad advice. He
did not know he was doing anything
wrong. He thinks now he was duped. He
does Jiot like to resign, because it would
look as if he acknowledged his guilt.
Dyer has made several contradictory
statements.
Professors Brun and Whittler were ap
pointed a committee to rccieve testimony
and arrange for able criminal counsel to
assist District Attorney Campbell of San
Jo^e, who is preparing for a complete in
vestigation. Dyer was served with the de
| maud of the mass meeting to resign hi 3
j office while before the committee. He ac
knowltdgeJ its receipt, but made no an
swer.
The following appeal was issued by the
committee:
It Is a matter of common knowledge that the
State of California has long been disgraced by
I the Slavery or Chinese pirls. The fact that this
! traffic i? confined to Chinese subjects does not
niitifcate t: )e offense against law and decency or
lessen the mural responsibility of the citizens
Of the J-tate. It is also a matter of common
; knowledge that this traffic coulu not continue
i ;! it were not for the connivance <>r assistance
"t unscrupulous attorneys and officers of the
[ law. That the people of the State have not
hitherto crushed out this traffic is a disgrace.
The recent rase of Kirn Quey is an apgra
vated one. Rescued from v Chinese den In
Fan Francisco by the Presbyterian Chinese
Horn*, the girl was arrested last Thursday
ever.lnc on a warrant lftued by Justice Dyer
of Palo Alto on a charge of petty larceny. Miss
Cameron, superintendent Of the home, accom
panied the prisoner to Palo Alto. She refused
to leave the girl,' hoping to regain charge of her
after her trial. In consequence she was lodged
in (all with her.
At 2 a. m., desp'te thÂ» piendinps and protest
of Mis* Cameron, who tsad barricaded the jail ;
dfÂ»or. two deputy constables with a pickax
forced their way in. After a stniKKle the pris
oner was forcibly separated frÂ«'m Miss Cameron
and driven off in a waiting bupgy by cne of the
constables.
The Justice of the Peace and the two Chinese
prosecutors met the constable ar.d his prisoner
on the county road. ThÂ«>re nnd then, at about
2:30 a. m.. court waÂ« held, f )r. â¢ of the Chinese,
artine aÂ« interpret or. pleaded guilty for the
prisoner, the other paid the fine and the Klrl. on
hrr discharge, was taken away l,v the two Chi-
nese.
Such cases have hitherto been difficult to deal
with on account of thÂ» shrewdness of the of-
fpnrtfrs. Perjury is common an<l money is trwiy
used. The case at Palo Alto seems to lurnish
an opportunity to ;est the methods us<-d by
those <-r,sasTP<l In such practices. The District
Attorney of the cv.unty of Santa Clara has the
matter in hand. Money is needed to employ as
pnr'.af; counsel. A considerable amount lias
r>e"n raided her**. But the honor and Interests
of the whole ?tatt? aro involved. We appeal to
the people of thf- Ftate for financial aid to
probe th!iÂ» matter to the bottom.

ADVERTISEMENTS.OUR COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.
UPON the issues to be investigated by the Inter

terests of the coast depend. It is not too much lo
say that every great industry of this section of the
Union is either directly or indirectly concerned in
them. Freight rates affect industry and commerce as

It is said that Congress will probably establish in
the South three more national parks â one at Stone
River, Tennessee, one near Atlanta, Ga., and one in
the Wilderness, Virginia. These parks and their
maintenance cost money, and it is probable that if
the South keeps on she will get the price of her
slaves paid in public parks for the enjoyment of her
people and the attraction of tourists.
The Attorney General has gone to Washington, in

the Interstate Commerce Commission and clothe it
with authority to see that justice is done.
The main issue at stake has been raised by the
efforts of commercial and manufacturing houses and
corporations of the large cities of the Mississippi Val
ley to obtain freight rates which will enable them to
exploit the trade of the Pacific Coast at the expense
of the local jobbers and manufacturers. The St. Louis
men ask for differentials which will give them advan
tage over the business men of the Pacific Coast, and
with such persistency have they urged the claim that
it has become a serious menace to our welfare.
It is to be borne in mind that a concession of the
St. Louis claims would in no wise benefit any class
of people on the Pacific Coast. At the present rates
the Mississippi Valley men have^ virtual control of
the trade of the whole Western territory from the
Mississippi River to within about 300 miles of the
ocean. They can deliver goods within the coast dis
trict itself, but with the present differentials can make
no profit on the trade. They seek lower rates, there
fore, not for the purpose of selling their goods any
cheaper to retailers or to consumers but solely for the
purpose of making a p-ofit for themselves.
The contention of the Pacific Coast ports in this
matter is firmly founded upon natural conditions.
These ports having water communication are entitled
to such railway rates as the competition of steamships
and sailing vessels would naturally fix were there no
Governmental or corporation interference to prevent
the free operation of the laws of trade. It is against
these natural rights that St. Louis protests. The mer
chants and manufacturers of that locality wish to have
the Interstate Commerce Commission compel the rail
roads to set aside the geographical advantages of San
Francisco and confer upon St. Louis artificial ones,
which will make the coast territory tributary to St.
Louis trade.
. Should the San Francisco merchants ask the com
mission to establish differentials which would enable
them to deliver goods from this city at Omaha more
cheaply than they could be delivered from St. Louis;
should they ask for freight rates which would place
the whole Oriental trade of the country in the hands
of Pacific Coast ports and enable our merchants to
distribute the entire tea trade of the Union and deliver
tea in small lots at Dubuque more cheaply than it
could be distributed from Chicago, the Mississippi
Valley men would then have a realizing sense of the
injustice of their present claims. They would then
perceive that for one city to ask the Government to
give it advantage over another city in the territory of
that city without consideration of geographical rela
tions would be an attempt to make an unfair use of
Governmental authority. Yet St. Louis is asking just
that sort of advantage against the local manufacturers
and jobbers of the Pacific Coast. It is an effort at
unfair aggression which we believe the Commerce
Commission can be relied on to defeat.

related how a certain man had been

A European nautical writer. F. T.

but Mr. Jane's system appears to be less
speculative than others suggested by
noted naval experts. He divides the fight
ing ships, exclusive of torpedo-boat de
stroyers, torpedo boats and other special
craft, into seven rates, the first of which
is, of course, the battleship. The superi
ority of the latter is gauged by the follow
ing requisites:
1. Its vitals so protected that no projec
tile stands much chance of reaching
them, even at close range.
2. Main armor must consist of the most
powerful armor-piercing gun*, not to be
put out of action by small shell.
3. Secondary battery to be well pro
tected and powerful.

down the fire of a ship in a lower class.

HEROIC STATUE OF WASHLXGTOX.
THE CURED FRUIT COMBINE.
I \EPORTS concerning the movement for the or-
I â / ganization of a co-operative union among the
producers and packers of cured fruits are to
the effect that orchardists representing upward of
31,000 acres of prunes have signed the agreement, and
it is estimated that this assures to the association
control of about 75 per cent of the expected crop.
That amount, however, it appears, is: not sufficient
to assure the co-operation of the packers with the
giowers, and consequently efforts are now being
made to bring into the association such an additional
number of producers us will give it control of 90 per
cent of the crop.
From the tendencies of trade in these days it is a
plain conclusion that unless the cured-fruit men can
co-operate to protect their industry it will suffer spo
liation from half a dozen different sources. Evidence
submitted at the hearings of the Interstate Commerce
Commission at Los Angeles confirms all the stories
told of railway combines to raise rates on fruit ship
ments, of special privileges granted by railway com
panies to the owners of cars prepared for hauling
fruit, of rebates conceded to middlemen and of other
rebates conceded by middlemen to big shippers.
These combinations to extort undue profits from the
fruit producer have their machinery working at the
home market itself, while at the other end of the line
are further combines of commission men and large
dealers who also wait to get a share of the spoils.
As a result of these combinations and their compe
tition in selling the fruit to the retailer, the cured
fruit market is subject to such fluctuations that retail
ers hesitate to lay in any considerable stock of goods,
for fear the price may fall after they have bought. As
they have no large stock, they have no interest in
pushing the goods upon the market or extending
their use among consumers. Thus there are the double
evils of a cinch at one end of the line and apathy at
the other end to prevent the fruit-growers and curers
from obtaining their due share of the value of their
product.
That some of the expectations of the co-operative
movement are ovcrsanguine is not to be doubted.
The increase in the price of raisins last season, for
example, has been attributed wholly to the effect of
the organization of a co-operative union among rai
sin. men. and no allowance has been made for the fact
that with the return of prosperity following the years
of depression all sorts of products rose in price, and
that the prices of raisins would have advanced with
the rest had there been no combination. None the
less the organization served and serves a good pur
pose. It may be stated as a safe proposition that even
if co-operative unions do not raise the price of an
article to the consumer by the slightest degree, they
yet benefit the producer by enabling him to get a
better proportion of the price than he would other
wise.
The curcd-fruit men of the Pacific Coast are be
tween the devil of cinch combines at home and the
deep sea of a comparatively inactive market in the
East. By co-operation they can overcome both of
these evils. They can make themselves sufficiently
strong to obtain favorable rates from the railroads just
as other big shippers do, and by giving stability to
the market they will encourage retailers to purchase
larger stocks of goods and introduce them to an in
creasing number of consumers. The issue is before
the fruit men and cannot be evaded. It is co-opera
tion now, or a demoralized fruit market this fall.
A PLEA FOR SEA GULLS.
WHEN fashion decreed that all fair dames and
maidens should wear ostrich feathers in their
hats she conferred something of a benefit on
the world, because the demand for such feathers set a
considerable number of persons to breeding and rais
ing ostriches. Thus there sprang into existence a
new industry and a breed of birds once in danger of
extinction became carefully guarded and protected.
Fashion has now changed her decree and ordained
the use of a different style of feather for the decoration
cf feminine headwear and this time her orders arc the
very opposite of beneficial. The feathers now in use
are obtained, it appears, very largely from sea gulh.
These birds arc so numerous it is not worth while to
raise them for their feathers and consequently they are
being slaughtered by the wholesale.
So extensively have the birds been killed along the
Atlantic Coast that the American Ornithologists'
Union has found it necessary to issue a note of warn
ing against the practice. It says:
"This country is on the verge of losing forever one
of the main features of its sea coast charms â the sea
birds themselves. In fact, the terns, the most ex
quisite of the gull family, and which formerly
thronged our whole coast, have been so nearly wiped
out by agents of the milliners that this year's on
slaught, already fully organized, will glean almost the
last pair from the few small breeding colonies which
remain, wherever these are unprotected. And the
larger gulls, which are not only very beautiful, but
absolutely essential as harbor scavengers, are also
being decimated for the same purpose."
The report goes on to direct attention to the fact
that the breeding season is approaching and that the
chances are, unless some protection be afforded, the
more beautifully feathered gulls, and particularly the
terns, arc liable to be slaughtered as fast as they arrive
at their nesting places. The law, which in many
States forbids the killing of gulls, is not enforced with
sufficient vigilance at present to protect birds whose
feathers have now become valuable and the Ornitholo
gists' Union appeals for money to defray the expense
of providing protection until a new fashion in feathers
is established.
As the gulls are the scavengers of our sea ports
their loss would result in a serious menace to public
health. The issue, it will be seen, is one of consider
able importance. So long as fashion demands gull
feathers the girls will have them and milliners must
get them. No complaint has thus far been heard of
gull-killing on this coast, but if it be stopped in the
East and the demand for the feathers continue, it will
not be long before a supply will be sought for from
this side the continent. It will be well therefore for
our authorities to be watchful. We have lots of sea
gulls, but have none to spare.

of the past few weeks seems to be passing away.
The loss in bank clearings last week was only
3.8 per cent, and all the largest cities, except New
York and Boston, showed a gain, a condition which
has not prevailed for over a month. But the failures
continued to exhibit an increase, those for the week
being 203, against 194 for the same week last year.
There seems to be more leaven in commerce. Prices
are fluctuating more, and there is a disposition to oper
ate. Provisions continue to advance, and it must not
be forgotten that a rise in provisions is very apt to be
followed by increased activity in general trade.
Leather, which declined in February, has regained
tone, and is higher, though the advance has restricted
the movement in boots and shoes. The decline in
....
r.iaes is less pronounced, and from several points
come reports of a steadier feeling. Iron has ceased to
boom, and is growing weaker, as the production has
at last caught up with the consumption, and is even
exceeding it in some descriptions. Hence the down
ward tendency in quotations. Cotton, too, which has
been very active of late, has quieted down, though
m2tiy of the mills are still sold ahead. Wool is dull
:n all positions, and the woolen goods trade is re
ported quieter, with lower quotations for some kinds.
Wheat is kept trembling on the verge of an alternate
advance and decline, but the latter condition would
probably prevail were it not for the strength in corn,
which has been in sharp export demand for some
time, and the rise in provisions, which imparts sym
pathetic speculative firmness to wheat. The French
crop is reported seriously damaged, the deficiency
from last year being estimated at 64,000,000 bushels,
but this source of strength is offset by continued
heavy shipments from the Argentine, so prices hover
shout the same old point, being firmer one day and
weaker the next. Dry goods are quiet, the whole
sale spring demand having been satisfied, and mer
chants are waiting for assortment orders from the
ictailers. Dealers in carpets and upholstery, both
luxuries, report large orders on their books. The
lumber trade, on the contrary, reports an accumula
tion of stock in some markets, and this staple shows
less firmness than for some time.
The feeling in Wall street is better. .The new cur
rency bill is increasing the circulation, and the Treas
ury Department is predicting a reduction in war
t?.xes. as the revenue receipts are running ahead of
the expenditures, and the army and navy bills arc
much smaller. Another firm condition is the renewed
buying of American securities by London, though
railroads are preferred to industrials, which are dull
and rather weak than otherwise. But prices do not
rise much under this improved feeling in the street,
as it i<- noticed that any increased buying demand is
immediately met by free offerings of stock on the
part of holders who have become tired and wish to
realize. J
The only feature in the local market is the need of
rain. Continued fine weather, accompanied now and
thrn by drying north winds, has' hardened the surface
of the soil, and the farmers are again wanting rain.
Thus far there is no serious inconvenience, except
in the i-outhern pan of the State, but showers from
now on will be necessary to produce those enormous
crops -.vhich everybody is looking for. The jicld of
fruit still promises to be immense, as there have been
no frosts thus far. and tree fruits are getting pretty
far advanced to be hurt by an ordinary frost, though
the danger period for grapes is still to come. The
plane of prices for canners' fruits this year will be
watched with anxiety by fruit-growers, as the canners'
combine i- now in full blast, and its effect on prices
is regarded with general apprehension by the farmers.
Sr.n Francisco fruit merchants say that if the combine
breaks down prices to a very low point the fruit
growers in a number of large districts will be obliged,
in self-preservation, to start co-operayve canneries on
their own account, which would be a fine thing for
the fruit industry of California. Oppression breeds
mi itir.ee, but thus far there has been no oppression
The forger who robbed the United States Govern
ment out of thousands of dollars is back among us
wWi a congratulation that he gave his pursuers a
long chase. If he rinds satisfaction in that fact he
must contemplate a long term in prison with posi
tive glee.
The Police Department has begun a raid on the
dives and pitfalls of the city. It will be interesting
to observe at what particular point the crusade will
stop.
A REVISION OF WAR TAXES.
y\yl ORE than ordinarily gratifying is the report
/ \ from the special correspondent of The Call
fy at Washington that there is a prospect Con
gress may undertake a revision of the war tax at this
session. A short time ago, when The Call directed
the attention of California Congressmen to their
pledge to urge revision in the direction of putting:
an end to the ambiguities by which the express com
panies shirked their taxes upon the public, it was
announced that nothing could be expected in the way
of such legislation at this time, as Congress would
not have time to revise the law.
/-\ 'Â«*Â¦Â¦Â¦
Uur correspondent now reports that Representa
tive Levy of New York, who has introduced a bill
proposing a general reduction of the war tax. has had
a conference with the President on the subject and
has found him so favorable to the bill that it may yet
be taken up as an administration measure.
The President is quoted as saying he is in favor of
a reduction in war taxes and the only question in his
mind is whether it would be good policy at the pres
ent time. He is afraid that it might affect the business
interests of the country. If he thought the business
interests of the country would not be disturbed by the
recommending of a reduction at this time he would
do so. Otherwise he would wait until after the elec
tion. The report adds that Republican leaders in
Congress are not prepared to announce what their
policy will be in dealing with this issue, which has
been so suddenly raised by yesterday's Cabinet meet
ing, but they will be forced to decide upon a definite
course in the near future.
Even with the backing of the administration, the
chances of bringing about a general revision of the
war revenue act at this session may be slight, but it
will be worth while to make the best and utmost
use of them, and Congressmen from this State should
cordially co-operate with Mr. Levy in urging the
movement. Any bill which opens the reve""* net
for discussion and revision will give an opportunity
for correcting those seeming detects of language
which have enable the express companies to shirk
taxes, evade the law. defy the courts and mock at the
people ever since the act went into force. It is more
over an issue that should be taken up before the com
ing election. A wrong should be remedied as soon
as it has been discovered, and there never will be a
better time to remedy this particular wrong than
right now.

FRANCE expressed her friendship for America by
the gift of Bartholdl's Statue of liberty; the
women of the United States have reciprocated by
presenting to the people of the French republic a
statue of George Washington, the father of liberty.
The statue, of heroic pize, is the work of Daniel Chester
French of New York and Edward C. Potter of Enfleld.
Mass. French modeled the figure of Washington and his
fellow-worker the horse. The monument has been cast in,
bronzo and was one of the largest castings of its kind
ever made In this country. It is now on its way to it 3

CLAIMS HE ACTED
IN SELF-DEFENSE
Blake Franklin's Reason for Attack
ing Mrs. Parmentier and Her
Two Daughters.
Blake Franklin, who was arrested on
Saturday night on a charge of assault to
do great bodily harm upon Louisa Par
mentler. 3C9 Jones street, does not con
sider that he did -wrong In striking tha
woman, and claims that he acted in self
defense. Friends of Franklin called upon
Judge Conlan yesterday to intercede for
him, but the Judge was deaf to entreaties,
and fixed his bonds in JlOOO.
"Mrs. Parmentler." said Franklin yes
terday, "always has a row with a boarder
who is leaving, as I will be able to prove.
She first took possession of my hat. and
then took the hat of my friend, thinking
It was also mine. I tried to take It from
her, and she struck at me wtth a fire
shovel. Her daughter Louisa attacked mo
from the rear and her other daughter
helped her mother In front. You see. I
had to defend myself against three in
furiated Frenchwomen, und it was no
Joke."
A friend of Franklin who used to beard
in the house told Judse Con Jan that he
narrowly missed getting Into a similar
scrape but he got out of it by paying a
month 3 rent 4n advance and clearing
out.

Severed His Windpipe.

AMUSEMENTS.
mILES T. BAIRD, a brave j'oung
soldier who won his spurs in the
Philippines, and Miss Ruth Es
telle Jackson, a very beautiful
and accomplished society girl of this city,
were united in marriage in the Church of
Notre Dame dcs Victoires on Saturday
afternoon. The ceremony was witnessed
by only the immediate relatives of the
contracting couple.
A tinge of romance attaches to tho
courtship of the young couple, which
dates back to the outbreak of the war
with Spain, when young Baird and his
brother, fired with tne patriotism of
youth, enlisted in the army that was sent
to conquer the Spaniards in the Philip
pines. Miles entered the Fourteenth Reg
ular Infantry and his brother enlisted in
the First California Volunteers, and both
saw service at the front. When Miles left
San Francisco he carried in his keeping
the heart of Miss Jackson and the deter
mination to make' himself a worthy cus
todian. When the opportunity came for
the young soldier to show his mettle he
proved himself a hero.
One night tho men of the Fourteenth In
fantry were lying at Pasay and could
hoar the guns of the Washington Volun
teers, who were at San Pedro Macati, on
the PaslÂ£ River, ihe regulars were told
lo keep their positions, but during the
night daring squads crossed to the firing
line and there discovered that the volun
teers, who were armed with Springflelds,
were suffering l'roni the lire of the Fili
hino BnarpautiOters, who were armod with
Mausers. On thc-ir return to their com
mand the regulars told their story. Miles
and two comrades then slipped away with
out orders and joined the volunteers. The
following morning' the colonel of the
Washingtonians called for volunteers to
cross the Paslg River and dislodge the
sharpshooters. Miles Baird and his com
rades volunteered and were chosen to do
the datigeroua task. While crossinp in a
canoe they were under constant fire, and
when half way over the boat capsized.
Baird is an excellent swimmer and was in
Â¦â f i.;:t 0.....pp ti""Ht one of his com
panions was likely to drown, he swam to
him and helped bring him ashore. But
for the fact that Baird and his compan
ions had left camp without orders they
would have been mentioned in general or
ders. As it was all v/ere highly rora
mended for their daring, especially Miles,
who pro%*ed doubly a hero.
The engagement that long existed be
tween the young couple was not to have
terminated in marriage for another
month, but owing to the groom being
called East on urgent business it was de
cided by their parents to have the mar
riage celebrated immediately so that the
couple could enjoy a honeymoon on the
trip. They will leave to-day for New
York and will be gone three months and
on their return will take up their resi
dence in this city.
The bride is a daughter of a well-known
capitalist of Los Angeles. She Is a grad
uate of the local High School and finished
her education in Miss West's academy.
She is quite a favorite in society. The
groom is the son of Mrs. V. C. Baird of
2513 Pacific avenue.

CHANGES TO BE MADE
IN THE POLICE FORCE
The roliee Pension Commissioners will
hold their first regular quarterly meeting
this afternoon, when Captain Bohen of
the detective department, as foreshad
owed ln ( last Monday's Call, will be re
tired. It was reported that Captain Dun
levy of the Hnrbor district would also be
retired," but Chief Sullivan is authority
for the statement that there is no truth
in tho report. It is belived, however, that
other members of the department who are
on the eligible list will also be retired
this afternoon. -Â¦ \
It is generally conceded that Captain
Seymour, now in charge of the City Pris
on, will be promoted to the vacancy
caused by the retirement of Bohen, and
that Lieutenant Esola will be made a
captain to succeed Seymour in the prison.
That will leave a lieutenancy for some
sergeant, and a number are already can
vassing for the job. , 'Â¦''- Â¦Â¦Â¦â.
As soon as the new head of the de
tective department takes command there
will be a shaking up in the "upper office,"
but who will be retired to the ranks and
who promoted Is a matter of conjecture.
The Chief's "Order No. 3" will remove all
doubt and anxiety for those concerned.

SUFFERING COPS
REQUIRE POROUS
PLASTERS QUICK
New Exercise Regulations
Are Rapidly Making
Wrecks of Them.
THE almost constant drilling of the
members of the Police Department
in order to ceduce their avoirdupois
and incidentally to build up their
wasted muscles has resulted in a
number of them being laid up for repairs.
Realizing that if the drilling continued
there would not be over a half-dozen men
left to partol the classic precincts south
of the slot, Sergeant Michael Joseph Con
boy of the Southern Station is seriously
thinking of appealing to the Humane So
ciety to call a halt.
The men are forced to drill In a cold
corridor in tho lower floor of the City
Hall, where the wind on a March day
sings a requiem to the policemen who
have laid down their lives in the perform
ance of their duties. Stripped to their
waists, big and little, fat and slender
"coppers" almost daily are lined up in the
cheerless corridor and put through a se
ries af calisthenics in .order to "strengthen
their muscles" and "re/luce their girths."
No deaths from the violent exercise have
yet been reported, but if the drills con
tinue, so says Michael Joseph Conboy,
many may be expected.
In several instances, however, the drill
ing of the men has resulted in reducing
the corpulency of the heavy-weights of
the department. Sergeant Barney Mc-
Manus, whose sun-kissed whiskers have
stirred more than one south of Market
street servant girl, is confident of getting
down to weight before long. He now
weighs only 250 pounds, two pounds less
than he weighed before he took his first
lesson In police calisthenics, which was
about a month ago. "Barney" is quite
hopeful, and says that when he loses some
of his rotundity he will challenge "Par
son" Bean to a bout with or without the
gloves.
Patrolman Knight, who prides himself
on being the heaviest man in tho depart
ment, has lost three pounds, and hopes to
lose more. Formerly he wore a ''nine
teen" collar, but he can now easily wear
one of eighteen, and three-quarter inches.
His bills for shirts have amounted to
about half his salary, as he Is compelled
to throw away his linen at the conclusion
of each drill. "Scotty" Campbell declares
that Knight is taking anti-fat medicine
and trying to make It appear that the
daily exercise through which he is put is

AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES.
Â»tato conventions had been the medtuin
for framing tbc State constitutions and
for the ratification of the Federal consti
tution and were familiar to the citizens.
I ho- early Stat>- nominating conventions
for selecting candidates for Governor and
Lieutenant Governor, though often trrejfu
ar!y constituted, were in some instances
regularly called and were made up of
aelegates chost-n by the party voters in
the counties. In others they were com
posed of a small number of party leaders
from ilifferent parts of the State. ThÂ«
irst State convention which can be called
"regular" seems to have been held in
H:irri.Â»KiiTTÂ» !->:Â» In 17SH
The Legislative Caucus.
But the difficulties and expense of travel
were perhaps the chief cause of a grad
ual change in the management of both,
State ana national party politics. This
was the substitution of the legislative
caucus for the State convention, and the
adoption of the Cossreasional caucus for
making Presidential nominations. It wan
both convenient and economical to leavo
to the legislators already assembled at
the capitals the business of making nomi
nations alont; with their other po
litical dutfe.s. liy the beginning: of
the century the practice of nomi
nating the State elective officers
through the joint caucus of party
members of the two branches of the 3tatÂ«
Legislature had become general and ma
the prevailing system until the year I>-1
âthe last year of the National Congres
sional caucus â while It did not finally
yield to the convention system until 13C5.
Even as late as lslo. according to Niles*
Register, a legislative nominating caucus
was neld in Maine.
The system was all the time subject to
severe criticism and strong opposition as
aristocratic, unfair, contrary to tne demo
cratic tendencies of the age-. Those dis
tricts in the State which sent Federalist
representatives to the assembly werÂ»
wholly unrepresented in the .Republican
caucus, as were Republican districts in
the Federal caucus, until, to mÂ«t that
objection , the caucus membership was in
some cases expanded to include delegates
especially sent up from unrepresented por
tions of" the State. The legislators wera
naturally disposed to cling tenaciously t'Â»
the power which had fallen Into their
hands, but the popular discontent was
widespread and continued to gather force,
while the idea of the nominating conven
tion grew in favor, and was adopted in
many States for the selection of candi
dates for the State elective offices befora
it was accepted for Presidential nomina^
tions.
The State legislative caucus did not al
ways confine itself to the nomination of
State officers; it occasionally, even in, tho
early years of the republic, recommended
candidates for the Presidency, and from
tho year 1824 that practice prevailed quUi
widely throughout the stag*; of transition
from the Congressional caucus to the na
tional nominating convention. In tomo
cases these nominations were made by tho
State Legislature In its official capacity.
In 15*07 many of the States thus put for
ward the name of Jefferson for a second,
term.
Development of the Nominating Con
vention.
The progressive consolidation of party
machinery, resulting in the complete as
cendency" of the convention system, took
place more rapidly in some States than in,
ethers. Permanent party organization
with regular, published calls for the va
rious county and State conventions, seems
to have been achieved in Pennsylvanl.ii
very early in the present century. Irreg
ularities there were at tirst. but the par
ties (.or. at least, the Democratic party>
soon adopted definite, orderly arrange
ments for delegate conventions in the sev
eral election areas. Massachusetts, pre
viously the leader in political develop
ment, followed more slowly than Penn
sylvania the path of party organization,
but Congressional and county conventions
had begun to be held there as early a3
IM'2. and in l>os the call for a convention
definitely stated the number of delegates
to which each town was entitled. District
conventions for nominating candidates for
the State Senate, to which delegates wern
chosen by primaries in the cities and
towns of the district, began to he held in
Xew York about I>ll. and the first Stan*
nominating convention was that of ISI7.
while the last State legislative caucus in
that State was as late as IS2J. This year
marks the final yielding by the Demo
cratic membprs of the Xew York Statfl
Legislature of the power to nominate tho
party candidate for Governor. In other
States a similar adjustment of party or
ganization to the convention system was
effected In course of periods of varylnsr
lentrth. and the year 1533 may he said to)
mnrk the domination of the system.
The. first "calls" for conventions wrr*
often anonymous, but they were later
sicn^d by officers of district or town mm
mlttres. It also soon became usual to
publish the proceedings of the convention
with the signatures of the chairman and
secretary. In general it may be said that
the procedure which had heen adopted in
district nnd Stfte conventions hv 1535 was
substantially that which prevails to-day.
Although the State convention as "a
norninnti r isj body for State officers entirely
supplanted the legislative caucus mow

IH. EARLY LOCAL AND STATE
PARTY ORGANIZATION.
BY JESSE MACY, LL.D
Just as the Govcrr.nu-nt of the United
States is the outgrowth of the two inde
pendent and sometimes conflicting ideas
of localism and centralization, so is Amer
ican party machinery a development from
two independent sources and along two
corresponding independent lines. The his
tory of national nominations has been
traced in previous chapters, till the un
certain and irregular party methods of
earlier years have been seen to give way
to the great Federal nominating body,
with its self-perpetuating organization.
But there is also the intricate local and
State party apparatus correlated to the
Federal party machinery and essential to
its harmonious working. This latter U
of far older origin, far more diverse in
form, and has a more varied and obscure
histor;-.
Nominations in the Colonies.
The local organizations, for formulating
and expressing political opinion which ex
isted in the colonies before the adoption
of the national constitution had come
down from the early days of popular gov
ernment in Englandâ with such modifica
tion and adaptation as our practical fore
fathers were accustomed to ra;#; In their
familiar institutions under changed condi
tions. Two methods of placing candidates
for office before the yours had been fa
miliar to ihÂ»- first English colonists la
th< ir ancestral home. They had been ac
customed to see aspirants for public pen*
sitior.s stand forth before itssemblies of
voters and discourse upon their own qual
ifications for the office sought, and they
had also seen candidates announced by
coteries of the local land-owners receive
the suffrages of the limited number of
voters. So in tne colonies candidacies
were frequently self-announced, especi
ally in the South, where, as well as in
the Southwestern States, that method
largely prevailed down to the Civil War.
But in the Northern colonies it was more
common for cliques of the leading men in
a community to atrrea together in private
conference respecting those for whom the
people should be asked to vote in an ap
proaching election. This sort of intiuence
controlled the New England town mat
ing to a great extent, and the "parlor
caucuses," as they came later to be called,
were a really worthy and acceptable po
litical agent. They fairly represented the
limited number of legal voters, and they
lr-d in general to the choice of suitable
persons for office.
Some sort of official nomination also
grew up in certain colonies by which men
designated for the purpost- in each county
chose candidates, while in Connecticut a
complex system arose by which the free
men of the colony, were accustomed to
vote for their Governor iUid magistrates
from a list of candidates nominated by
deputies of each town and the central
"court of election." and votes could be
cast for those only who had been pre
viously nominated. There seems to have
been an imperceptible change, at least in
the Northern colonies, by which nomina
tion by private conference of leading citi
zens and men of substance became nomi
nation by members of the Legislature.
Perhaps it was because these men of
means and intiuence had become legisla
tors and could act in that capacity as
well as in that of simple citizens.
Professor Howard, author of "Local
Constitutional History of the Tnited
States." finds in the colonial records of
Massachusetts evidence of the gradual de
velopment of a nominating system, in
which are the beginnings of both the cau
cus, or primary, and the convention, run
ning back to the year I>><<>. Nomination. 1 ?
for magistrates were made by the free
men in town meeting, and the general
court acting as a canvassing board re
turned back to the several towns the
names of those having the largest num
ber of votes as the accepted candidates to
be voted for at the general election. Two
years later a change in procedure re
quired each town to select one or two free
men, who should all meet and agree upon
the required number "of the most able
and tit men" to be nominated for magis
trates; while only those so nominated
should be eligible. By this law the dele
gates chosen by the "primaries" met in
"State convention" to make the nomina
tions.
Rise of the Caucus.
The word caucus did not come into use
until about the year 1724, when, his
torians tell us, a group of some twenty
men in the town of iiostbn. of whom the
father of the patriotic orator, Samuel
Adams, was one. were accustomed to meet
to consider practical questions in local
politics and to "lay their plans for intro
ducing certain persons into places of trust
and power." Then, having agreed as to
the person, each member of the group
used his influence with others to accom
plish what they wished. And they pro
vided "ballots, including the names of the
parties fixed upon, which they distributed
upon the days of election." So success
ful were their methods that "theygeneral
ly carried the elections to their own mind.
In like manner it was that Mr. Samuel
Adams first became a representative for
Boston." (Gordon's "History of the Amer
ican Revolution.")
Because these meetings were attended
by certain mechanics called "calkers."
from the ship-building yards at the north
end of Boston, they came to be called
"calkers' clubs," which was corrupted
into "caucus clubs" or "caucuses."
Though writers differ, this is the deriva
tion given by colonial authors of the word
which tills so large a place in American
political history. Like many another in
stitution unknown to tne law. thÂ«> caucus
has played a far mr>re influential part in
politics than have multitudes of govern
mental devices having all legal sanctions.
The caucus of pre-revolutionary times
was identical In Its functions with the
caucus or "primary" of to-day.
Closely allied to the caucus clubs In
composition and purpose were the numer
ous patriotic societies and committees of
safety which sprung up throughout the
land' before and during the revolution â
such as the "Sons of Liberty" with Its
many branches. Wherever despotic gov
ernment presses upon a people intelligent
enough to work together to accomplish an
end, such organizations always arise. The
people inevitably combine to resist oppres
sion. To some extent the American so
cieties were modeled after the French
Jacobin societies but they acted also as
nominating bodies. When one of these
societies, or caucuses, appointed a com
mittee of conference to meet with other
committees from other clubs to consider
in respect to candidates for elective of
fice they Instituted what was really, in ef
fect, a delegate convention.
When the Government had become free,
the caucusâ which by that time was gen
eral, at least throughout the Northern
Statesâ gradually ceased to be held In se
cret, and in those localities where the
town meeting prevailed differed little
from a town meeting of the party voters.
Such it still remains in many places,
chiefly in New England, outskle of the
large cities and in States settled by New
England people. That is, the caucus is a
gathering for conference, for discussion
of the merits of candidates and the ex
change of views. But in some of the
States, and especially in the cities, the
caucus, or primary, has grown too large
to afford opportunity for discussion and
is simply a meeting for the election of
delegates to the nominating conventions
and of party members of the various com
mittees. This of course forces the real
selection of candidates further back into
the clubs or committee? or "parlor cau
cuses," whose work is more or less secret
and irresponsible.
The First Conventions.
Under the constitution the old ways of
local nomination continued to prevail un
til, with the increase of population, some
necessary modification appeared. Candi
dates for officeâ national. State or localâ
who were elected by districts were still
self-announced or were selected by mass
meetings of the party voters In tne elec
tion area. These mass-meetings, growing
too large and unwieldly for their pur
pose, gradually became gatherings of deiÂ»
egates, self-selected at first, to act for
their party, but after a time regularly ap
pointed members of a nominating con
vention. The State convention seems to
bave been the method first employed for
the nomination of State elective officers.

however, and is now almost well.
The Sheridan brought up besides her

CONNEMARA IS
STILL FIT TO
RUN AS OF OLD
James Dean'r* Campaigner
Captures the Champion
Stake.
Inglesidc Coursing Park Manage
ment Postpones Finish of tlie
Op?n Stake Through
Lack of Hares.
James Dean's old ramjialpmer Conne
mara captured tho final In the slxteen
dog champion sta^e yesterday at Ingle
side Coursing Park, with I-opez & Son's
Whitehead us runner-np. Connemara
showed well all through the s=take and
was a favorite with the bettors. In the
j run down he beat St. Helen pointless, and
I won from Master Claire in the first tie
j aft^r a close course. With Papita. Con
nrmara had a hard, oven run, winning
finally with a score of 4 to 3.
The final was a short one of fifteen sec
onds. Connemara showed two lengths in
I front 'and took the tlrst turn. Whitehead
thru dashed in and killÂ«-d the hare and
likewise his chancÂ«f for lirst prize. The
runner-up did hard work in all his runs.
In the run down ap^iiibt Tea iiot.e he won
out aftt-r a hard undecided and in the
fir.^t tie the course with Theron was a
gruelling one. IVhJtehead showed speed
over Golden Rule in the second, winning
v t 4 to <$.
Vouner America and Tloho ran the long
est rurAbif tlu- day. necessitating the re
lease of relief dogs to end the course.
I3ohe would have bÂ»eii a dangerous factor
in the final Inn for her hard runs. She
was beaten out by Golden Rule after two
hard und< cid.-d courses.
The open stake wax not finished, being
run only to the third tie. The manage
ment was disappointed on a consignment
of hares which was ordered, but got lost
somewhere, between Merced and San
Francisco, and decided to postpone the
finals in the "open" until Thursday. The
dogs remaining In the stake are well
matched and the winner is hard to pick,
though Victor (jueen looks a likely candi
date f"r the final.
Quite a disappointment was felt at the
non-appearance of imported Overture. In
a private trial Ih-- tlog showed tjreat speed
j and was looked upon to surprise the ones
I who dubbed him a "false alarm." Over
ture showed up lame early in the day
and it was decided to withdraw him.

HORSEMEN BREAKFAST
NEAR THE BREAKERS
Notwithstanding the Weather Small
Crowds Enjoy the Sabbath in
the Open.
Although the weather di<l not favor the
pleasure-seekers yesterday several jolly
parties were In the park and on the beach,
and between showers enjoyed their outintr.
Early in the morning, before the rain be
gan falling, a party of horsemen, among
them being Gavin McNab, Vanderlynn
Stow, George W. Fletcher and J. C. Wil
jon, mounted their steeds for a gallop.
The breakfast hour found them at the
Clilt House, with appetites sharpened by
the ride. After breakfast and a general
good time the horsemen again continued
on their way. returning to the city late in
the afternoon. Kquestrian parties are be
coming more popular every year and
doubtless the near future will see them in
numbers on the park and county roads.
The crowds at the Park and Cliff yester
day were not large. . The rain continued
just far enough into the afternoon to
change the plans of those who anticipated
spending the afternoon out of doors and
although the late hours of the day were
very pleasant the people were afraid to
trust the threatening clouds and remained
at home.
Emil Markeberg's balloon ascension was
the feature at the Chutes yesterday.
Markeberg made a splendid ascension and

FOURTEEN-POUND
SALMON PROVES
THE STAR CATCH
P. E. Kennetti Lands a
Great Fish Near Camp
Taylor.
The Trout Season Opens Auspiciously
Despite the Discomforts Inci
dental to a Heavy Rain
and a High Wind.
?
The unexpected rain and the.hiph wind
which prevailed yesterday had a depress
ing effect on the fishermen who went far
afield in quest of trout upon tho opening
day of the season. It also had the effect
of keeping down the size of the strings
with which the anglers returned. The
star catch of the day. so far reported, was
that of a fotirteen-pnund salmon by P. R.
Kennetti. at the bridge below Camp Tay
lor. For one hmir and six minutes the
great fish fought for his life and then,
worn out by his efforts to escape, he suc
cumbed and was landed.
The sensational struggle attracted all
the anglers in the vicinity. They lined
the banks of the stream and watched with
eager interest the efforts of the great lish
to free himself from me fly which had
seemed so tempting a morsel when he
saw it alight softly on 'the surface of the
water. Air. Kennetti used a six and three
quarter-ounce rod.
The honor of catching the largest trout
belongs to J. F. Slebe. secretary of the
Tamalpais Club. The tish weighed a lit
tle over two and a half pounds. The
members of the Tamalpais Club rented
the fishing rights of ttu- streams on the
old Throckmnrtnn ranch, and Howard
Black. F. S. Butler. H. \V. Wayne, Fred
Drirkhou.-=e and W. C. Hrcwn left the city
on Saturday night to be early on hand
for the opening day. The three former
fished together and eaueht among them
over seventy-rive fish. Drinkhouse and
BIailÂ», a!Â«o members of the club, caught
over ninety. All the members complained
that the wind f;lÂ»*w so hard that it was
almost impossible to cast a fly. but that
the streams abounded with fish. William
Osborn caught three dozen fair size fiÂ«h.
but left the club grounds early Jrs the
day.
E. W. S. Van Slyke tÂ»Â»lls a good story
on himself and John Butler, the veteran
angler. On Saturday afternoon they de
cided they wou'd get their hand in by
doing a little tide-water fishing at Point
Reyes. They sat for over two hour?, but
were unable" to land a tish. A small boy
arrived nn the seem 1 with the proverbial
two-bit fishing rod, nnd they had the mor
tification cf seeing Inm land over thirty
fnif fish in less tbar. an hour. Both fish-
Kitifn made up for their bad luck yes
terday by bringing home good baskets of
iish.
H. Robertson and J. TV. dibb fished the.
streams near Tocnlomn and cam*' back
to the city with a string of tweaty-three
trout.
Amor.tr othÂ£TÂ« who flsbrrt at Tnraloma
were "D<^" Watr. Frank Poble and

\V. A. Cooper and George Walker fished

LAMEDA, April I.â Douglas U.
// \\ Quint, an assistant weigher in the
Ji % United States customs service at
San Francisco, was suspended yes
terday morning by Surveyor of the Port
Joseph S. Spear Jr. This morning about
7 o'clock the lifeless body of Quint was
found in a bed at his home. 1917 Chestnut
street, this city, by his wife. ' Death was
due to asphyxiation by gas.
AVhether Quint's demise was accidental
or premeditated is problematical, but sev
eral circumstances tend to show that the
gas was turned on with a deadly pur
pose. Quint had of late spoken to several
of his friends about making away with
himself. Three weeks ago he took out a
lift> insurance policy for JoOt*).
Yesterday afternoon Quint called at the
barber-shop of Bruno Kunck, on Park
street, near Railroad avenue, and after
asking for a friend sat for pome time In
the shop without speaking and appearing
to be in a despondent mood. Quint re
tired early last evening. About 11 o'clock
Mrs. Quint, who had been entertaining a
lady caller, opened the door of her hus
band's bedroom, looked in. and. observ
ing that he was apparently slumbering
peacefully, retired to her own room with
her young child.
Some time after mhlnlpht Mrs. Quint
heard noises in her husband's room, but
thinking that he had arisen to secure a

This morning on going to the rinor of her
husband's room she detected the odor of
gas. She entered the room and was horri

face. She rushed out of the nouse and
notified several neighbors and also sent
for Dr. C. O. Bull. An examination waa
made, and although tjuint"s body was still

The dead man was th^ son of the lato

Quint, and dauphtrr. Mis* E. Quint, reslda
at 1553 Pacific avenue. Deceased was a
i.ative of Sacramento, aged 22 years.
About six years ago Quint married Miss
Jessie Wall, a daughter of the late Gen

Will Meet Debris Commis
sion To-Day to Discuss
His Mission.
Typical Instance of Rejuvenation of
California Mining Property and
Interesting Facts From
Many Sections.
An important conference took place Sun
day between Hon. A. Caminetti and the
Debris Commission concerning the mission
of Mr. Caminetti in Washington to urge
that the restraining dania shall be built at
once. The com:ni3sion is favorable to the
work and there is $500,000 on hand ready
to begin with. Mr. Caminetti will prob
ably start for Washington on Tuesday of
this week. Attorney General Ford and
Senator Davis of Amad6r will counsel
with Mr. Caminetti in Washington. The
California delegation is favorable, and the
recent extra session of the Legislature
adopted resolutions advocating early
work.
An item of interest In mining news is
the rejuvenation of a mine in Yuba Coun
ty, in Browns Valley, which was once a
thriving mining camp, but which has been
idle for many years, until four years ago
the Webb Gold Mining Company opened
the DanebroKe-Pennsylvania mines, which
now are being operated by the Victor Min
ing Company. The theme is familiar.
Many mining (.amps that were deserted
have been started up again and are pay
ing well, owing to the general advance in
facilities and economies of operation.
There is a shaft iH.it! feet down at the
Danebroge and the company has drifted
feOO feet.
The mill, hoist, pump and all the works
are run by electricity furnished by the
i'uba Power Company. Among the old
mines in this locality were the Daniel
Webster, Americus, Jefferson, Pennsyl
vania, llawkeye, Danebroge, Paragon,
Mastick and Rattlesnake. ; There were
others, some of which will be reopened,
in all probability. Large sums were onco
taken irom them. In reopening the Dane
broge various relics were found to remind
the workers of their predecessors. One
of these was a candle, partly burned, that
had been dropped in tne mine something
like, forty yeard ago. George Leszirisky
is the manager and T. J. Hlbbert the
superintendent.
In explanation of a recent ruling of the
United States Land Office concerning the
work that must be done in a group of
claims Register Blanchard of Salt Lake
City writes: "The ruling of the Commis
sioner of the Land urnce was in a case
where the applicant sought to apply the
work done on the gruund for which
United States patents nad been issued in
1Â»75 as the Â»o<w improvements on a lode
claim or recent uate and for which a
separate application and entry had just
been made. There- was a timo when tne
land otliee accepted sucn improvements
upon patented ground for later locations
as sulncient compliance with the require
ments that ib>Â») worth of labor or im
provements must be expended or made to
enable tne owner or owners to obtain
the United States patent.
"This and this only is now affected by
the new ruling. Where the work is done
and the improvements made upon one
claim of a group, the claims of tho group
consolidated, and the whole group eÂ»n
braced in one entry and application for a
patent, there is no change in the practice,
and there is no doubt but what this work
and improvements will hold the group
and enable the applicants to obtain pat
ents trom the Government."
The official mint reports of the mineral
productions of the State of Colorado In
the year IMÂ»9, as revised, show the tuilow
ing totals: Gold, $26,265, 4^7 ; coinage value
ot silver, $29,b7'J,7u6; lead, $6,061,150; copper,
$1,275,518; total value ot gold and silver,
$55,y4j,iya; total value of ail minerals pro
uuced, J&J.971,bt)7. The commercial value of
the silver produced was *1:j,7u7,582.
In the Snasta King copper mine, in the
Backbone district, bnasiu. County, above
Copley, six compressed air drills will be
put to work in the different tunnels. An
order has been placed for the drills by
John Fillins. The people back of the mine
are Bostonlans.
Sam Duncan, J. W. Harris, D. C. Me-
Dotigal, H. 11. Huntington and P. W.
Grant of Hopland have ounded the Gilles
pie Quicksilver mine, near the Mountain
House.
The Last Chance Gold Mining Com
pany, wnich recently purchased tne I'aul
sen," Union Hill and Uutton Creek piucer
properties, in Trinity County, will cut a
iweive-mile ditch to take water out of
Grass Valley Creek. \V. 11. Hill is the
general manager.
The new cyanide plant at Hedges, San
Diego County, was started on the 21th
inst. It has a capacity of 33-1 1-3 tons of
tailings per day, which capacity will be
enlarged three-told later. There will be
'Mo stamps at the mines, capable of handl
ing 1100 tons of ore per day.
â¢ihe Royal Consolidated Mining Com
pany at Hudson will, so the MoKelumne
Hill Chronicle says, erect a new tki-stamp
mill near their mine, to be used in con
nection with the old 60-stamp mill, which
is some distance from the works. When
the old m'lll was built it was impossible
to bring the water used in the batteries
nearer to the mine. Now the company
gets water from the Salt Spring Valley
reservoir, which overcomes the old difh
culty.
The Redding Searchlight is authority
for the statement that the Tarbet people
of Salt Lake have a new bond on the
Afterthought mine, and that the bonders
will work fifteen men, divided into three
shifts. A shaft will be sunk between 200
and 300 feet, when the ledge will be drifted
on to determine the extent of the prop
erty.
Tne new Blue Point mine at Smartsville,
Yuba County, will be operated by the
milling process hereafter. Richard Irvine
& Co. of New York have become interest
ed with William Kohnun, lessee of the
property. It was tirst worked as a hy
draulic proposition; then was drifted.
Drifting was abandoned because the top
gravel caved to the depth ut 250 feet.
The Gannan mines, consisting of four
teen claims, situated in the Arrow mining
district, San Bernardino County, nave
been sold. Shafts, tunnels and drifts on
the property amount to 1500 fet-t. The pur
chasers are the Gannon Gold and Copper
Alining and Milling Company, incorporat
ed by W. A. Barker, T. A. Gannon. I. U.
Inskeep, John J. Shay and O. H. Barker
of Los Angeles.
W. A. Temple has been East in connec
tion with the sale of the Mammoth and
Balakala copper mines in Shasta County,
which he has bonded. The first has a
price of $101,500 upon it and the second
$100,000. The bonds expire April 5.

HEINSBERG'S HOME IS
LOOTED BY BURGLARS
During the Ahseuce of the Family
Thieves Carry Away Consider
able Booty.
Through the Industry of one or more
burglars the expenses of J. A. Heins
berg's two Â¦weeks' outing were ma
terially increased. Mr. Ileinsberg with
his family left the city two week 3
ago for. an outing and, not think
ing of burglars, left all the family
plate, plated-warÂ«Â» jewelry and -my val
uable pieces of bric-a-brac in their home,
2142 Sutter street. Saturday the family
returned home and found the interior of
the house a wreck. All of the articles men
tioned were missing, and the contents of
drawers and chests were scattered over
the rooms.
An investigation developed the fact that
the burglar or burglars gained entrance
either with a key or lock pick. The mat
ter was reported to the police, but like
many other burglaries that have occurred
in the Western Addition during the past
few months there is no clew to the crim
inal. Â¦-'Â¦<' -Â¦"â¢:

Pythians Bury Eemains of Com
rades Who Died in Phil
ippines.
Another funeral procession wound up
the road to the National Cemetery at the
Presidio yesterday. It was led by three
caissons bearing the bodies of three mem
bers of the Fourth Cavalry, who died in
the Philippines. The men were all mem
bers of the order of the Knights of
I'ythias, and it was under the auspices of
their old lodge. Mars Lodge No. 202, that
they were buried.
The men were sergeant Major Robert
son, Sergeant Craig of Troop C and Pri
vate Branigan of Troop B. Their bodies
have been in the Y. M. C. A. building until
such a time as the lodge could get to
gether and hold suitable ceremonies at
their interment.
The column of knights with a band met
the caissons at the Lombard-street gate.
An escort and firing party of twelve men
from the Third United States Artillery
had been provided from the garrison. The
pall bearers were Past Chancellors Robert
G. Barton, "Eugene J. Sullivan, Theodore
Dormer, It. M. Beach and Fred S. Holland.
Grand Prelate Albert S. Morrison of Mars
Lodge officiated. Â¦ V: -
At the grave Past Supreme Representa
tive George H. Morrison delivered the
funeral oration. It was an eloquent trib
ute to the memory of his gallant com
rades. They had been held high in the
esteem both of their brother knights and
their comrades in the regiment, and of the
hundreds who followed the flag-draped
caissons there were few who had not been
their friends.
The full ritual of the Pythian burial
service was rendered and then the three
volleys and taps gave them their last
farewell.

The Bishops of the Methodist church have

failed to make an advance and Instead Is called
upon to record a liackward step. This Is the
most appalling statistic of the day. There is
c dearth in all denominations. Xor has the
Lutheran church occasion to look on with com

that the results have been Insignificant com

WASHED UPON THE ROCKS
OF NARROW-GAUGE MOLE
Body Supposed to Be That of Jack
Lowry Recovered From
the Bay.
ALAMKDA, April I.â A body, believed
to that of Jack Lowry, who jumped from
an Oakland boat on the 23d ult., was
found by two flshermen on the rocks at
the south side of the narrow-gauge mole
this morning. The general appearance of
the body is that of Lowry, and the identi
fication is made the more complete from
the fact that there was found on the body
one of the cards of the Brilliant Sign Let
ter Company, a firm which Lowry was
representing just before he disappeared.
It was k7iown that Lowry was feeling
very despondent over business losses.
When last seen he was on his way to the
narrow-gauge mole.
The body recovered from the water is
hardly recognizable. It can be seen,
however, that there is a tattooed ring ou
the little finger of the left hand, two more
of the same kind on the index finger of
the same hand and an anchor tattooed on
the left wrist.
JOKERS CUT LOOSE ON
THE ANNUAL FOOL'S DAY
COON SONGS AND
MELODRAMA MIXED
There was a largo, delighted, delicious
audience at the California Theater yester
day afternoon to see "On the Suwanee
River" â one of those responsive, human
crowds, that take melodrama more seri
ously than life itself and throb breath
lessly through these conflicts between vir
tue and vice with spasms of applause and
outbreaks of villain-hissing that give joy
to the managers and- promote the gayety
of the normal minority.
But the audience was not the only
amusing feature of the performance.
There is comedy in "On the Suwanee
River," most of which is furnished by
Stella Mahew, who does coon with a near
ness to the real thing that is admirable
and which marks ht-r an artist of in
dividual ability. She hasn't the best kind
of a part, and when she takes her turn
at specialties her songs are without any
merit whatever, except that which her
personality and cleverness give them.
This Is considerable, and if she but had
a chance at some good material she would
be sure to arrive.
Miss Mahew's make-up Is so good and
her coonisms are so truthful that if she
did not expose her Caucasian cuticle
above her grease-paint gloves in self
defense one would be justified in taking
her for a gentlewoman of color.
There is a quartet of real blacks with
the company, one member of which is
noteworthy, not only for his extreme
length but for his humor, which, although
exagerated, is not the less laughable. He
gives evidence, too, of having a very fair
voice and a capital Irish dialect, and
should be glv^n a chance to do some
thing single-handed, with the chances all
in his favor of making a hit. His name,
as well as I could ascertain from the pro
gramme, is Joe Jeanette.
The quartet sings only comic songs,
which is a relief after years of "The Old
Oakt-n Bucket" and similar abominations,
and deserves the thanks as well as the
applause of every one. There is merit in
the acting of Lew A. Warner, and noth
ing offensive in the rest of the distribu
tion. The worst feature of the per
formance and the most popular was the
bad singing of a bad song by Fred Tms
dalo: but, as he was encored a half dozen
times he will probably persist in pleasing
in spite of my dissent.

Fighting to Stay the Greedy
Hand of St. Louis
Jobbers.
San Francisco Wholesalers Prepared
to Make Out a Strong Case Be
fore Interstate Commis
sion To-Day.
?
The investigation to be continued in this
city to-day by the Interstate Commerce
Commission is one of vital importance to
the commercial interests not only of San
Francisco but of the entire Pacific Coast.
Briefly the whole matter resolves itself
into a fight of the jobbers of the Middle
West to control the trade of the Paciilc
Coast, throttle Its wholesalers and rob
this territory of Its individuality and make
it tributary to St. Louis and other largo
Western commercial centers.
The jobbers of the Pacific Coast will not
submit to the greed of the St. Louis peo
ple without a determined opposition. Dur
ing the session of the commission held in
Los Angeles much testimony was brought
out to show that there was no discrimina
tion in freight rates against the jobbers of
the Middle West. It was also demon
strated that the St. Louis wholesalers had
no thought for the consumer in the pres
ent struggle, but were making the tight
solely for the purpose of increasing their
own profits.
Merchants of San Francisco are pre
pared .to supplement the testimony given
in Los Angeles with equally strong evi
dence of tho injustice that would be done
the coast if any alterations are made in
the existing differentials. â¢ .â¢ -
Four members of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, accompanied by their
clerks and a number of attorneys, rail
road men and business men interested In
the cases now being heard by them, ar
rived from the south' yesterday noon and
registered at the Palace Hotel. Chair
man Martin A. Knapp, who was unable
to attend the meeting at Los Angeles, ar
rived from the East in time to join his
colleagues on their journey northward
and will sit with the commission to-day.
The other members in town are: Ex-Gov
ernor J. W. Flfor of Bloomlngton, 111.;
Judson C. Clements of Georgia and J. D.
Yoemans of Washington. All of the
members except Chairman Knapp are ac
companied by their families. Assistant
Secretary M. S. Decker and J. H. Fish
beck and J. J. Aullffe, official reporters,
are also with the party.
Judge R. S. Lovett of Houston, Tex.: H.
L. Christie of St. Louis and Henry J.
Stevens of Los Angeles, who represent
the Santa Fe, are the legal lights In the
train of the Commissioners. C. A. Parker,
commissioner of the St. Louis Freight
Bureau; J. M. Allen, representing a large
drug house of St. Louis, and W. H. Du
laney of Louisville, Kv., are here to look
after the interests of the Middle West
jobbers and also J. J. Wait of Chicago,
who represents Hibbard. Spencer, Bartlett
& Co. and Franklin. McVeigh & Co.
In an interview Commissioner Yoemans
said the Commissioners hoped to get
through with the taking of testimony
here <in three days' time and that they
would then proceed north to hold brief
sessions at Portland and Seattle.
THE SAN--FBANCISCO; CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 2, 1900.
HELEN C BURLINGHAM, DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION BY. TROUBLE
FAMILY troubles and a series of misfortunes following 1 each other In rapid
succession have had a most peculiar and mystifying effect upon Mrs. Helen
C. Burlingham. who was taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital yester
day afternoon in a state of complete collapse. She was found by Patrol
man Callahan lying on the floor of the Sausalito ferry waiting room.
The Harbor Hospital physicians surmised that she was suffering from mor
phine poisoning, but no trace of the drug could be found about her. There was
not the slightest odor of liquor or opium on her breath.
When the physicians succeeded in resuscitating her it was found that the
woman had been rendered speechless through whatever cause had led to her col
lapse.
By the use of an electric batten' she was got Into such a condition that she
was able to tell, in an almost Incoherent way, a disconnected story of her mis
fortunes. She said these had followed so closely that she was driven to distrac
tion and hoped that death would end her woes. With that hope her memory
failed. She felt as though death had, really claimed her and she knew no more
until she rejalned consciousness in the Harbor Hospital.
A quarrel with her husband some months ago, the information through an
anonymous letter that hje was suing her for a divorce In Seattle, and the spend
ing of her last cent for a steamer ticket to that place, were a few of her mis
fortunes. Her cup of bitterness overflowed yesterday when she hastened to the
dock of the steamer Queen only to discover that she was too late, and was left
alone in a great city penniless, homeless and without a friend. It was then
that she prayed for death, and as she wandered along the city front and into
the ferry waiting room unconsciousness gave her temporary surcease of her
woes.
According to her story she formerly resided with her husband at 113 Washing
ton street, Los Angeles. They quarreled and parted several months ago. The
first she heard of her husband after the separation was through an anonymous
letter from Seattle, telling her that he was suing her for a divorce. Almost at
the same time, she claims, her husband wrote to her for the purpose of getting
her to sign deeds to property owned by them In common.
She at once began an investigation and asserts that she found that her hus
band had a particular friend in one Mrs. Brickel. Mrs. Burlingham wrote to J.
E. Hawkins, an attorney in the Seattle National Bank building. That gentle
man advised her to file an answer to her husband's complaint, which she did. The
husband at once dropped the suit and. 'according to Attorney Hawkins, trans
ferred all his property to Mrs. Brickel. x
Acting upon the advice of her attorney, Mrs. Burllngham determined to go
to Seattle and fight her husband on his own ground and, as stated, she purchased
a ticket for Puget Sound and was to have sailed yesterday on the steamer Queen.
Her trunk and all her belongings, save a hand' satchel, have gone to Seattle on
the Queen, but It will be some time before she can follow them. Physically Mrs.
Burllngham seems to be all right, but Dr. Morrison considers her a nervous
wreck.
Mrs. Burlingham's suit- to have the husband's transfer of his property to Mrs.
Brickel set aside is to be heatd April 16. If she recovers I sufficiently within the
next few days she can still catch the Walla Walla and be In time .for the call
ing of the case-
THROWN INTO
JAIL WITH HIS
SKULL BROKEN
Frank Jackson, Although
Dying, Is Locked Up for
Being Drunk.
â¢
Through, the Blundering Methods of
Dr. Cherry He Is Sent From the
Hospital to the City %
Prison.
? Â¦Â¦
Through the blundering methods of As
sistant Police Surgeon Cherry, Frank
Jackson, a laborer, lies dying in the Re
ceiving Hospital. Yesterday Jackson was
struck on the head with a rifle by
Thomas Lavvry, a saloonkeeper at Tenth
and Folsom streets, the force of the blow
fracturing his skull. He was at once re
moved to the Receiving Hospital, wnere
Dr. Cherry, after treating him for a
scalp wound, ordered him locked up in the
City Prison for drunkenness, notwith
standing that Jackson is not a drinking
man. After being placed in a cell Jackson
became unconscious and seemed to be in
a dying condition.
Desk Sergeant Browne had him returned
to the hospital with a request that the
wound in his head be thoroughly exam
ined. This was over live hours after theÂ»
unfortunate man had been injured. Polict
Surgeon Uunnell fortunately happened to
be present and he very readily discovered
that Jackson was suffering from a broken
skull. The necessary operation was hur
riedly performed and the broken parts of
the skull removed. As the proper atten
tion had not been given him in time. It is
extremely doubtful If Jackson leaves thu
hospital alive. Last night he was in a dy
ing condition and the surgeons at the
hospital had little hope for his recovery.
The trouble that led up to the assault
occurred in Lawry's saloon. Jackson vis
ited the place to see a friend, and while
conversing with him Lawry. who had
been drinking heavily, suddenly appeared
in his underclothes. He was armed with
a rifle, and, pointing it at Jackson,
threatened to blow his head off. Jackson
seized the weapon, and in the struggle
that followed Lawry brought It down on
Jackson's head.
As the hapless man fell unconscious to
the floor Mrs. Lawry, who was present,
sun moned Police Officer Beach, to whom
she said that she believed Jackson had
fallen, his head striking against a cus
pidor.
On learning: of the assault Detectives
Ryan and ODea went in search of Jack
son, intending to get a statement of the
occurrence from him. Failing to find
him In the hospital they visited the prison
and found him lying unconscious in a
cell. After he was returned to the hos
pital the detectives went to Lawry's
saloon and placed him under arrest on a
charge of an assault to commit murder.
Subsequently he became so violent from
the effects of the liquor he imbibed that
the prison officials had him removed to
the detention ward of the hospital, where
he was placed in a padded cell to prevent
him from doing any injury to himself.
Formal charges will be filed against
Cherry with the Board of Health to-day.

WILLIAM E TOLIVER ATTACKING THE SUPPOSED BURGLAR.
<T LOUIS HORNER. clerk In the of-
I flee of Attorneys Foote & Ler
tLJ/ men. Is a somnambulist on a small
Fcale. and it led him into a serious
scrape early yesterday morning. Homer
r*"sides at 810 Bush street, and William E.
Toliver, a clerk in the Coast and Geodetic
Â£ urvey office, occupies the adjoining room.
The two men were etrangers to each
other.
About 4 o'clock yesterday morning Toli
ver vras awakened from a sound sleep by
thÂ« efforts of some one trying to j
force oj>en the window of his room, j
He was considerably startled, as j
J.:s room 15 oa the second etory,
iind immediately Jumped to the con
clusion that a burglar was at work. He ;
pxoped for something with which" to de- I
f<:r.<i himself and picked up his pocket
knife-, which was on a tab'e near the bed.
He ope-ned the large blade and jumped \
out of bed. The Intruder had by this time
forced the window open and was crawl
ing through. Toliver rushed upon him
and made a slash at him with the knife,
cutting him on the left temple. The man '
threw his left arm up to protect his face I
and Toliver Flashed the arm and the blade j
pwejit down and cut the man's lip. The j
man then yelled out: "For God"s sake.;
don't cut me again; I'm the fellow that
lives in the next room."
The Intruder was Homer attired In his
underclothes, and Toliver dragged him In
side. Not a word was said. Toliver sup
ported Homer to his room, but found the I
door locked, the key being on the inplde.
Just then Homer fainted and Toliver
Pressed himself hurriedly and ran out of
the house In search of a physician. As he
Â¦was dashing down to Sutler street he was
teeosted by Policeman Mulcahey, who
afked him where he was going.
"I am running for a doctor, as I have
cut a man in my room," replied Toliver.
llulcahey re-turned with him to the j
house, and afte-r seeing Homer rang in i
?or the ambulance. Homer was tak&n to
the Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Cherry
stitched and dressed his wounds. None
is dangerous, but the one on the left arm
is about six inches long.
Mulcahey took Toliver to the City
Prison, but no charge was booked against
him, and he was' allowed to sit on the
bench in front of the desk sergeant. Cap
tain Seymour detailed Detective Cody on
the cafe and he reported the facts as re^
lated. The extraordinary feature of the
affair was how Homer managed to crawl
from his window to Toliver's without fall
ing to the street. In front of both win
dows Is a ledge about two feet broad and
between the two windows, a distance of
four or five feet, is" - a small ledge about
six Inches broad, which Homer had to
pass over before reaching Toliver's win
dow. Homer in speaking of the affair
said:
"I went home between 12 and 1 o'clock
this morning and went immediately to
bed. I always. sleep In my underclothes.
I remembered nothing more till I got cut
on my left arm and yelled out that I lived
in the next room. I suppose I must have
got up in my sleep. I have done it pre
viously, but never got outside my room.
I don't blame the man who cut me, as I
would have done the same thing under the
same circumstances."
Toliver said he could think of nothing
elsÂ© except that the man was a burglar,
and he had to defend himself.
"I was so excited," he said, "that It was
lurky for Hornor he cried out when I cut
him the second time, as I would have
continued to cut him and might have mur
dered him. I am sorry for it, but I am
not to blame."
Captain Seymour reported the facts to
Chief Sullivan and the Chief instructed
him to take Toliver before Judge Conlan,
who was holding court for the disposal of
the "drunks." Toliver related his story
to the Judge, who decided that no chargo
could be placed against him under tho
circumstances, and allowed him to go
after exacting a promise that he would be
in court at noon to-day, for fear Homer's
wounds might take a serious turn.
In the afternoon Toliver called at the
Receiving Hospital to see Homer. It was
the first time they had met and they
looked at each other curiously for a mo
ment, then Homer held out his hand,
which was instantly grasped by Toliver.
Homer relieved Toliver's mind by saying
he did not blame him, and they chatted
together for some time. In the afternoon
Homer was taken from the hospital by
M. S. Hamilton, his cousin, to his home
in Oakland. Homer was to have appeared
before the Civil Service Commissioners to
day for examination.

?
The fact that at least 400 teachers failed
to pay an assessment wherewith to bear
the expenses of litigation in the lawsuits
instituted by the pedagogues and mer
chant creditors of the School Department
lias caused considerable criticism and
Â¦unfavorable comment on the part of the
*>ther 75<J teachers who were thereby com
pelled to bear the burden of the expenses.
What makes this failure all the more
repiehtnsible in the eyes of the latter is
that the 4jO who ne-g'.ected for various
reasons to produce their little pro rata of
the expense of litigation reaped the bene
fits of the final settlement whereby the.
employes of the department received 63
per cent of their unpaid salaries for No
vember. IS3S. besides an additional $7000,
voluntarily surrendered to them by the
merchant creditors from a fund of
J'-COoO which was di-potited in escrow with
the Union Trust Company.
Those who paid the assessments, how
ever, have be'Â»-n reimbursed out of this
$7000, and are- therefore entitled to all the
jjrlory of the favorable settlement without
hufforlng the less of a single cent. The
other 40>j are now berating themselves for
not having contributed to the fund as
they had faithfully promised to do when
the ciflicuities between the teachers and
creditors lirst manifested themselves, as
their assessment would likewise have been
returned to them.
"U*hen the teachers set about protecting
themselves in the matter of their unpaid
Falarics for November and December. IS9B.
they appointed the following- committee
to look after their interests: Charles H.
Murphy. MiÂ«s E. E. Stlncen. Mrs. L. K.
Burke, "W. D. Klngs\jnry and Louis de F.
33art!ett. It was agreed that whatever this
committee decided upon would be ratified.
even to the levying of an assessment.
Lawyers were engaged to defend the
claims of the teachers against those of
the merchants, and this, of course, re
quired money. In order to meet the ex
pense an assessment of 1 per cent was
duly levied on the salaries for April, 1899.
It was then that nearly 400 teachers failed
to come up with the assessment. No rea
sons were ever assigned, but it was whis
pered that many of those delinquent had
received favors from the Ragan-Waller
board, through whose extravagance the
funds for teachers' salaries for Novem
ber and December, ISOS, were not forth
coming. On account of friendships to
members of that board it is said that they
opnosed litigation at any cost.
When the committee was confronted
with the dilemma of not having sufficient
funds, it reported the matter to those
who had subscribed, and they cheerfully
made up the difference. Another assess
ment of 1 per cent was levied in July, and
again there were many delinquents. Some
who had paid the first assessment refused
to pay the second, while the delinquents
on the first failed to experience a change
of heart. Again was the deficiency made
up, and when the last assessment was
levied in October similar conditions pre
vailed. The result was that about . 750
teachers were compelled to produce about
J2600. which was all used to protect the
salaries of teachers and janitors for over
a year and a half. This money, however,
was returned to the subscribers out or
the $7000 surrendered to the teachers by
the merchants, the remaining $5000 being
divided pro rata among all the employes
In the department In the came manner as
other moneys received from collateral in
heritance taxes had been distributed.
This explains why dark looks are di
rected to the delinquents who would not
stand part of the burden when the case
looked black for the teachers. The assess
ment would not have exceeded more than
$2 for each teacher, but this, according to
their brethren who paid up like little men
and women, makes it all the more repre
hensible.
Another difficulty which the committee
had to contend with was that In the set
tlement with the Union Trust Company,
which paid over the $7000 from moneys
! held in trust, thirty-seven would not sign
| the agreement. Of these eight are jan-
I ltors and twenty-nine teachers. This ne
cessitated the giving of a bond of $2500
by the committee, which entailed an ad-
I ditional expense. No other reason is as-
I signed for this refusal to sign except
that it was thought that It would be a
surrender of their rights to the merchants
and in the nature of a bribe to the latter,
who had presented the teachers with a
bonus of $7000 over and above their de
mands.
The final report of the committee will
be read this afternoon at 4 o'clock . In
Judge Garbcr's office, when a full flnan
cal statement will be read, and the busi
ness for which the committee was ap
pointed will be concluded.

QUARREL OVER
A PICNIC ENDS
IN A SUICIDE
Mrs. Kate Linegar Swallowed
Poison in Her Husband's
Presence.
They Engaged in a Dispute About"
Their Daughter Going to a
Picnic and That
Was All.
Mrs. Kate Llnegar, wife of James P.
Linegar, painter. 11SS Harrison street,
committed suicide yesterday afternoon by
swallowing a dose of carbolic acid. She
was taken to the Receiving Hospital In
the ambulance but died in about an hour
after reaching thero and her body was
removed to the Morgue.
The picnic season opened yesterday and
Mrs. Liinegar and her husband had a
quarrel abuut their daughter going to a
picnic. The father had objected to the
girl Koinis, but the mother allowed her
to go. Mrs. Linegar had the bottle of
acid In the house, and during the quarrel
she took it and went outside. Her huÂ«
band looked out of the window and saw
her take the cork out of the bottle, and
looking toward him said, "Here goes,;
Jim," and swallowed the contents.
She fell shrieking to the ground and
Linegar rushed outside and carried her
into the house. He was so excited that
valuable ime was lost in notifying the hos
pital. Dr. Cherry did all he could for tho
unfortunate woman, but the deadly poison
had got too much headway. Her hus
band and second son were with her when
she died. . j
She .was 44 years of age and had five
grown children. The eldest son came to
the hospital after she died and his grief
was pathetic. He defied the Morgue of
ficials to take his mother's body away and
it was some minutes before they could
quiet him down. The girl did not know
of her mother's death till she returned
friii* the licnic.
Linegar said that his wife had threat
ened several times to commit suicide, but
he never thought she would carry her
threats into execution.
