placed it iii front and on both flanks of
the principal British army. The force in

the column to the east, which struck such

reckoned with at once. Lrfjrd Mothuen is

"Meanwhile Lieutenant Chestermaster?
of Remington's Scouts found a passage
across the spruit unoccupied by the en

great steadiness, notwithstanding all that
had previously occurred. Â¦
"Broadwood's report, which has just
reached me and which contains no details,
stated that he had lost seven guns and

casualties at about 350, including 200 miss

ordered General French, with two remain

of the Ninth Division. The latter, after a

yet reported." '
The War Office received a second dis
patch from Lord Roberts, dated Bloem
fontein, Sunday, April 1, 8:15 p. m., in
which, after referring to his previous tele
gram, he gives a partial list of the miss-
Ing British officers. Of Q Battery four
officers were wounded, two of whom are
missing. One gunner was killed and forty
non-commissioned officers and men are
wounded or missing. Lord Roberts then
continues: .
"In' TJ Battery all are missing except
Major Taylor and a sergeant major. Two
cavalry regiments did not suffer so much.
A report has just come in that the enemy
has retired toward Ladybrand, leaving
twejve wounded officers and some seventy
men at the waterworks. We are now
sending ambulances for them."
It will be noticed that in the foregoing
advices. Lord Roberts says nothing In
regard to the British guns being recap-
tacked on three sides. He immediately
dispatched two horse artillery batteries
and his baggage toward Bloemfontein,
covering some of them with his cavalry.

BUSHMAN'S KOP. Sunday. April 1 â
Following the scouts nf General French's

ccrrespondent witnessed one of the most
terrible spectacles of the war. Horses lay

Ghastly human bodies with the wrecks of
wagons and food and forage scattered

and the only wonder Is that a single mari

' On crossing th* spruit, where the. ground
rises Immediately toward a grassy knoll,
with stony slopes facing the drift, ono
came upon an Inclosure from which it
was possible to fire over the drift. At this
point the spruit makes a circular bend,
while the south embankment, which Is
protected by the partially constructed
railway embankment, enabled the enernv
to pour in a galling fire on three sides, as
well as a double tier of fire In front.
When the convoy was first attacked a
scene of frightful confusion followed. Th<*
mules stampeded and the wagons were
overturned, while the concealed enemy
poured In a deadly fire.
When the first battery appeared the
Boers seemed undesirous of continuing
the slaughter and called upon the British
to surrender. At that moment, however,
B Battery, which was escaping from the
rear of the convoy under heavy fire,
wheeled into action and began shelling
the Boers with the four remaining guns.
The Boers confess that this battery ac
counted for five killed and nine wounded
of their losses.
Early In the afternoon the Boers col
lected about the convoy began removing
the guns and wagons and permitted the

BAD MANAGEMENT
AMONG BRITISH TROOPS
LONDON. April 3.â The Bloemfontein
correspondent of the Times, telegraphing
Sunday with reference to the capture of
the convoy, says: Y:sT./'.Y :s T. /'.
"The whole affair was a flash, intended
to frighten Free Staters who were desir
ous of surrendering to Lord Roberts.
When General Colville arrived, although
he was almost destitute of mounted men
and had marched eighteen miles, he de
termined to turn the- river, crossing at
some point lower down than that occu

Smith-Dorrien's 1 brigade. Including the
Canadians, attempted another drift, which
turned the enemy's original position.
"For somÂ£ reason Lieutenant Colonel
Flint's artillery was detached at 2 o'clock
to the right, where it remained for a con
siderable period, 'shelling at. 5000 yards
range three of the enemy's guns that were
placed in the open in the vicinity of Col

"Consequently a large force of Boers
visible on the far side of the ilodder es

our Infantry advanced. Finally our guns
took up a position on rising ground be

WASHINGTON. April 2.âAdvo
cates and opponents of the Por

bill waged a vigorous war in the
Senate to-day for more 'than
seven hours. Long before the Senate con
vened at 11 o"clock the galleries were
crowded, and so they remained until the
Senate adjourned. Those who listened to
the debate to-day were well repaid. The
speeches were good and the running debate
unusually bright and lively. During the
f ;>eech of Spooner of Wisconsin the cham
ber seemed to scintillate with sparks as
he crossed argument! ve swords with some
of the best debaters on the Democratic
eide. -
Bate cf Tennessee opened the discussion
of the day with a carefully prepared
speech In opposition to the bill. He was
followed by Cullom (R.) of. Illinois in a
vigorous speech supporting the measure.
Then came Depew of New York, member
of the committee which framed the bill,
Â¦who made an eloquent and forceful de
fense of the measure. Sp6oner. who spoke
next, was followed by l'erkins of Califor
nia, also a member of the committee on
Porto Rico, who presented a strong argu
ment for the MIL The closing speech was
Ci Uvered by Simon iR.) of Oregon, who,
la rriti< iziiifr the measure, entered into a
brief discussion of the political effects of

The final vote on the bill will be taken
late to-morrow afternoon. It is arranged
for 4 o'clock; but an effort will be made
to extend the time for debate beyond that
hour.
Vest and Bate Lead .Off,
Vest of Missouri, rising: to a question of
privilege, s--aid upon his return to the city
after an abser.ee on account of illness, he
had found that on the vote to strike out
thÂ«> provision in the Porio Riean bill for
a duty of IS p-^r of the Dingley duties
he had l>*-en rioted as absent and not

Had ho bec-n present he would have voted
to strike out the duty on Porto Kican
products.
â¢ Proceeding, he directed attention to a
notable case, which h^ said had been
overlooked In all the argument?. A sailor
named Koss had shipped on an. American
merchantman from New York" to Xaga-
Fakl. At the la-tter point he had murdered
a fellow seaman on the vessel's deck and
was convicted arid sentenced to death by
a Consular court. His sentence was CGm
mutt*d to Imprisonment for life in the
A.ba.ny <N. V.) Penitentiary. He sued out
a writ of habeas corpus, the ground be
ing that he had not been given a trial by
Jury, as Insured by the constitution. The
Supreme Court decided that he had had a

in order to avail himself of the right to
trial by jury, the vessel must have been

States.
Vest said he would like any Senator to
explain how the Supreme Court could
come to that conclusion, and state em- 1
phatlcal'y that within the territorial lim
its of Hie United States the constitution*
applies without act of Congress or treaty
stipulation, and yet agree that a different
tariff can be imposed on the people of
Porto Rico from that imposed on the peo
ple of Missouri.
Bate of Tennessee, after the Porto
Rlcan bill had been laid formally before
the Senate, delivered his announced
speech ir. opposition to the pendir.K bill.
He directed his arjr^mor.t particularly

his speech embraced the whole question
of expansion and the treatment by the
Goveri)mei(t and by Congress of our in

against the acquisition of Spanish terri

which he votedâ and inquired:

James A* Shay, of the New York "Clipper." writes as follows i
"I cannot find language to express what I think of Warner's Safe Cure. For
some years I suffered with kidney (rouble and lame back, and could not attend to
business, and at times I could hardly walk. I consulted the best doctors I could
hear of, and spent hundreds of dollars purchasing medicine to reliere me, but
could obtain no relief and one year ago I began to take Warner's Safe Cure. I
used it faithfully for three months, and improved greatly, and to-day consider
myself among these who are strong and healthy. I regard Warner's Safe Cure
as the one thing in this world needful to those suffering from kidney trouble."
REDUCTION OF
THE WAR TAX
SEEMS LIKELY
House Adopts a Significant
Resolution Presented
by Payne.
Asks for Information as to the Sur
plus to Be Created Under the
Workings of the Pres
ent Law.
> ' ' '"
WASHINGTON. April 2.â A possible re
duction oi the war taxes was foreshadow
ed in a resolution adopted by the House
to-day, calling upon the Secretary of the
Treasury for information as to the prob
able surplus, that the "existing revenue
laws would create during this and .the
coming fiscal year. The resolution was
presented by Payne, the floor leader of
the majority.
Richardson of Tennessee asked if it
covered anything save the Internal rev
enue taxation under the war revenue act.
Payne replied that it did not. There was
no division on the adoption of the resolu
tion, which was as follows:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treas
ury be and is hereby requested to inform
the House of Representatives whether, in his
opinion, based upon such knowledge as he
has, the present laws for the ralÃlng of revenue
are creating and will continue to create a
surplus In the treasury, over and above the
wants of the Government, and if bo-, to what
extent at the end of the current liscal year,
and a like report as to the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1901; that he also report to the House
his estimate of the probable receipts of the
treasury from all sources of revenue for these
years, to wit: Customs, internal revenue and
miscellaneous sources.
Resolved. That he also report to the House
the amount of Internal revenue taxes received
under the war revenue act of June 13, IS^iS.
upon articles not theretofore taxed; that said
statement be itemized as fas as possible for
the year ending June 30, 1599, and lor the
nine months ending March 31, 1900.
Grosvenor of Ohio then introduced the
following resolution:
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treas
ury be, and he hereby is, requested to report
to the House of Representatives the names of
firms, persons and corporations who from time
to time have paid customs duties on goods
and articles of every description which have
entered the United States from Porto Rico
since the treaty with Spain, with the articles
and amounts paid by each and the dates of
such payments.
McÃae of Arkansas offered an amend
ment, adding to the resolution the fol
lowing words:
And also, if possible, from whom these Im
porters purchased said goods.*
Grosvenor declined to accept the amend
ment and the Democrats forced an aye
and no vote upon it. The amendment was
lost, 61 to 89, and the resolution was then
adopted with division.
This being District of Columbia day, the
House then proceeded to the consideration
or the district bill, passing among other
measures a bill to increase the tax on
premiums of foreign insurance companies
doing business in the District of Colum
bia, from one to two and a half per cent.
Curtis of Kansas moved the passage
under the suspension of the rules of the
Senate bill to ratify the agreement with
the Bannock and Shoshone Indians of
the Fort Hall reservation in Idaho. The
House Committee had amended the bill
to include ratification of th* Kiowa, Co
manche and Apache agreement for open
ing to settlement 2,500,000 acres in Okla
homa. The land in the Fort Hall reserva
tion aggregated 418,000 acres. Wilson of
Idaho and others advocated the passage
of the bill and it was passed without di
vision.
A Senate bill was passed to appropriate
$100,000 for the establishment of a military
post- at Sheridan. Wyo.

PAYNE EXPLAINS
HIS RESOLUTION
WASHINGTON. April 2.â The resolution
of Chairman Payne of the Ways and Means
Committee relative to the Treasury sur
plus and the probable income and en
pensea of the Government results from
the desire of the Ways and Means Com
mittee to know whether it will be safe to
recommend any reduction in the present
sources of income. After the adoption of
the resolution by the House Payne au
thorized the following statement:
Â¦The object of the resolution Is to get In
formation from the Secretary of the Treasury
that will enable the Ways and Means Com
mittee to determine whether It Is safe to at
tempt'a reduction, of the revenue, and In cane
that Is decided affirmatively, then along what
lines this reduction should be made. It is
true tfiere is a surplus of $54,000,000 for the
nine months ending Saturday last and $16.
500,000 for the month of March. Whether this
surplus is to be Increased or not for the
balance of the fiscal year is one of- the ques
tions on which we deÃire Information.
Should all of the $85,000,000 of bonds which
can be refunded under the refunding act be
presented, some $83,000,000 would be absorbed
In this operation. It will require $20,Â»KW.*X)0 to
refund the bonds already deposited with the
Secretary of the Treasury under the act re
cently passed. What we desire to know Is the
effect of this upon the surplus and the prob
able expenses of the next fiscal year. In order
to safely determine upon a reduction of the
revenue.
Mr. Payne was asked if he considered it
probable that legislation for this reduc
tion would be presented at this session of
Congress.
"I cannot say as to that until we get
the information. If any action is taken
sufficient reduction can be made under
the war revenue act, which was an emer
gency act passed In IS9B. I am opposed to
interfering In any way with the Dlngley
tariff law of 1897."

Cullom addressed the Senate briefly In
support of the bill. In the course of his
speech, referring to the opposition to the
bill. Cullom said:
LÂ«t the truth be known. This whole "free
trade" scheme is nothing on earth but a de
ception, delusion and a snare to mak<rour
people believe that we are oppressing poor
Porto Rico. Let the truth be known /,. w^ ult^ 1 !r
may happen. Any candid man I think, must
admit that this bill is in the interest of the
people of Porto Rica
Depew Supports the Bill.
D<?pew of New York then delivered his
announced speech. He vigorously sup
ported the pending measure and was
given a cordial hearing, iollowing Is De
pew's six.'ech:
What is all this contention about? What
iÂ« the aiple of discord which is lashing Â»ome
friends to fury? The President proposed .free
tra.ie. and this bill gives free trade in all the
necessaries of life, in all implements and man
ufactures required for the resuscitation, de- .
velopment and working of industries, ana a
tariff amountine, on the average, to 6 per cent
upon the market vulue of other products.
This tariff comes off by operation of law
in two years, and as much souner as the peo
i.'.e of the island, through their own Legisla
ture, decidt to abolish it, because they can
raise the revenues necessary for the support
cf their government. . their roads, and their
schools anJ for their general welfare by _ di
rect taxation. The opposition to this bill Is
the rtsJlt of the usual tactical operations for
advantageous positions in a Presidential year.
The Calhoun theory of the constitution and
the century-old fight of free trade' to destroy
limtwtion have made a united and det-i-erate
charge uj>on the policy anJ provisions of this
measure. The Ex-mocrattc position In regard
to our Island territories is clearly denned.
They will claim that the moment any terri
tori becomes tlie property *of the United States
by conquest, purchase, ctssion or discovery, it
is under our constitution and laws; that its
people and products have the same rights and
are entitled to the same freedom of movement
nil over the I'nited .States as the people and
products of any .State in the I'nion; that state
hood must speedily come and cannot be de
nied. This would break down every protective
barrier against iÂ»au[Â«r labor and admit free
into our ports the things produced by people
working in our tropical possessions for a few
cents a day and would degrade our citlzen
*hlp, and. therefore, if they get In power they
will at once abandon these islands.
The Republican party stands upon the action
of Jefferson. Monroe, Jackson. Polk. Pierce and
Peward thai Congress has the power to govern
these acquisitions subject only to the prohi
bitions or the constitution. I recall for the
consideration and admonition of my Demo
cratic friends that Btory of General Jackson's
<ioverTsor*hlp of Florida, to which he was ap
pointed by President Monroe, under the act of
Congress "of March 3. IS2I. providing "that all
military, civil and Judicial powers shall be
vested in such person and persuns and shall
be exercised in such manner a* the President
of the I'nited Ptates shall direct."
He claimed and exercised the executive
legislative and judicial functions of govern
ment under this commission and was sus
tained in them all. As legislature he enacted
laws which brought him, as Governor, in con
flict with the ex-Governor under Spain. As
Governor he promptly arrested and Imprisoned
that ex-official, and as Judge proceeded to
punish for contempt the Federal District Judge.
who had issued a writ of habeas corpus lor
the Spaniard's release. It was after all this
that he became and has since continued to be
claimed as leader, counselor and inspiration
for the Democratic party.
I'nJer this power we can and will provide
both for the development of our new posses
sions and the protection of industries and em
ployment .within the United States. As time
and experience demonstrates the necessity for
now laws and changes of existing laws, they
will be enacted, but always with intent to
maintain the high standard of American citl
znns-hlp and the scale of American wages.
Preferential tariffs will promote trade between
the United States and all these Islands.
Spooner Versus Tillman.
Applause swept over the galleries at the
conclusion of Depew's speech and it was
several minutes before Spooner (Wls.),
who followed the New York Senator, could
proceed. Said he:
Partisanship should nr.d no abiding place In
this discussion. The phrase, "The constitution
follows the flag," is a pretty eplgTam, but epi
grams are dancerous. Does the constitution
lollow the flag? No; It does not. Our army
entered Cuba during the war with Spain. Our
flae la there now. But is our constitution
there? No, certainly not. Can we 10-pislate
for Cuba? No; we cannot. Our soldiers are
there, hut the constitution is not. The only
law which follows the flag is the law of war.
The flee follows the constitution; not the con
stitution the Hag.
In response to a question asked by Till
man of South Carolina Epooner said:
The f reposition that the constitution extends
of its own force over acquired' territory was
invented in the Interest </f slavery; the new
d'jjraa was advocated in the Interest of elav
â¢Â¦<"}' by Calhoun. Webster opposed it in the in
terest of liberty and In the interest of sound
constitutional legislation.
The Calhoun dÂ«cma, we thought, was shct to
death on the unnumbered battlefields of the
war of the rebellion. I had supposed that, after
slavery had been laid away, we had heard the
last of this contention, which Is by no means bo
new as many people- teem to suppose.
Tillman inquired how it wVs that* the
United States army was in Porto Rico.
Spoonerâ By the power of the President as
commander-in-chief of the army. .
Tillman â Under the constitution? " Â¦
S-pocnerâ Certainly: yes; to the extent that
the constitution makes him commander-ln-chier
of oar army.
Tillmanâ Then the power of the President is
limited by the constitution?
Ppoonerâ No< not at all. His limitations are
only those of any commander-ln-chief of a civ
ilized nation.
Tillmanâ ls he bound by his oath of office?
Spoonerâ l do not suppose that because the
President tack, his constitutional oath of office
he is bound to take a copy of the constitution
in his pocket wherever the army under him
may go. The President Is in Porto Rico Just
as he is in the Philippines; Just as he was in
California after the treaty of cession. He is
there under the war power and he will remain
there in the exere lse of that power until Con
gTtss shall legislate for Porto Rico. By the ex
ercise of that power he changed some of the
I'orto Rlcan laws and modified the Porto Kican
tariffs.
In answer to a question by Tillman as
to why Porto Rico should be treated
differently from the Territories of the
United States Spooner declared the pend
ing measure was the most generous ever
proposed for any Territory belonging to
the United States and the people of the
ifland were being treated thus differently
from those of the Territories because they
were In dire distress.
Pettus Enters the Arena.
Bpooner maintained that territory ac
quired by the United States over which
the constitution has been extended could
not be disposed of by Congress, arid
demanded to know how we could proceed
to establish a stable government under
the constitution in the Philippines, for In
stance, and then later cede the islands,
either to another nation or" to the Fili
pinos themselves. If the constitution ex
tended over the acquired territory auto
matically that never could be ceded away.
Pettusâ Can Congress cede back the Gadsden
purchase?
Fnoonerâ l think bo.
rettunâ nut it cannot cede away Alabama.
The wildest Republican would ilot go bo far
as that. The constitution is In New Mexico,
however.
Spoonerâ lt is there only by statute. Dut if
the constitution had gone there of its own
force Congress would have no power to cede it
back.
An allusion being made further along
to the lobby, Â¦ which Spponer said was
urging free trade with Porto Rico, Bacon
suggested:

WEBSTER DAVIS, Who Has

CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. April 2.-
Webster Davis, Assistant Secretary of the
Interior, has tendered, his. resignation to
President McKinley and has given out a
statement making it appear 'that, the^ sole
reason for this action was a desire to free
himself from official restraint and be at
liberty to talk and. write freely about the
South African war. There,ls more behind
this action on the part of Mr. Davis, how
ever, than his statement indicates. ..Be
fore he left Washington for South Africa
the relations between Mr. Davis on .the
one hand and Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock and Commissioner of Pensions
Evans on the other hand were somewhat
strained, and it was rumored at the time
that he had been granted an indefinite
leave of absence and would not return
to active duty In the department.
In his capacity as assistant secretary
It was a fart of the duty of Mr. Davis to
review pension decisions, and some of his
decisions gave the impression that he was
more friendly to pension applicants than
was the Commissioner of Pensions. Com
missioner Evans was subjected to very
severe criticism from Grand Army men
throughout the country on account of the
alleged injustice of some of his rulings to
old soldiers, and cases that had been re
versed by Assistant Secretary Davis wero
cited as substantiating the criticisms.
Friends of Commissioner Evans did not
hesitate to attribute to Mr. Davis much
of the unpopularity in which the Com
missioner was held by Grand Army men.
It is the purpose of Mr. Davis to devote
himself to the writing of magazine arti
cles about the situation in South Africa
and delivering lectures on the war and on
the Boers. All that he writes and says
will be strongly pro-Boer in its sympa
thies. -, Â¦
tentlon to him?
Baconâ lt looks so. The committee did what
he demanded. I
Spoonerâ The Idea that the Congress of the
United States can be Influenced to do Injustice
to the people of Porto Rico, by Mr. Oxnard or
by any. protected interest, is a libel on our In
stitutions that ought not be uttered here and
oUght not to find lodgment everywhere. I want
to repeat that a large ' and industrious lobbyâ
and I say what I knowâ is here endeavoring to
induce Congress to pass a free-trade bill.
Baconâ l don't think that any one of that
lobby has deemed it to his interest to speak
to any Senator on this side of the chamber.
Foraker, in charge of the bill, said Ox
nard had appeared before the committee,
but since the day of his appearance he
(Foraker) had not seen him.
In answer to a question by Turley of
Tennessee as to the source whence the
revenue would be derived under the pend
ing bill, Spooner said: ~; " ; v
I xav It comes from the suear trust and its
importers, or from the rich sugar producers on
the island. In either event It Is richt. It
comes from the right spot and it will go to
the rlcht spot.
Spooner concluded with an earnest ap
peal for the passage of the measure.
Senator Perkins' Argument.
Perklns of California, one or the mem
bers of the committee which framed and
reported the pending bill, next addressed
the Senate in support of the measure.
He said Porto Rico had been thrust upon
the United States by the war with Spain.
Tne customs and beliefs of the people
were not those of Anglo-Saxons. They
were not Americans and could not become
Americans until they had passed through
the stages of development whichahad ele
vated the type of citizenshipâ¢ of the
United States. The United States was
dealing with questions entirely different
from those ever heretofore presented.
Congress was called upon. to explain for
a people entirely foreign to our institu
tions and a union with uscould come only
after they had been Americanized.
Self-government and 'self-support. Mr.
Perkins said in conclusion, were insepar
able. They never would be qualified for
the one without ability for the other. The
proposed tariff would tend to make them
self-supporting anu he believed the pro
position was as fair as any that had been
ever suggested.
In a brief speech, following that of Per-
SENATOR' FORAKER SfIYS:
T INDICATIONS are that the bill,
I amended as proposed by the com-
will pass the Senate by not
less than five or six votes and per
haps more. In my opinion the bill
will give great satisfaction .to the
people of both Porto Rico and the
United States. The President recom
mended, free trade. This will be a
near approach to compliance with
that recommendation. We give them
all duties collected and all duties
they will collect on goods imported

WHAT EFFECT WILL THE PORTO RICO TARIFF
BILL HAVE UPON THE COUNTRY?
SENATE LEADERS MATCH LOGIC IN THE
DEBATE ON THE PORTO RICAN MEASURE
WARNER'S BEMEDIES.
THE SAN FRANCISCO* CALL, TUESDAY, APEIL 3, 1900
SENATOR J. X- JONES SAYS:
I BELIEVE that when we ratified the
treaty Porto Rico . and the Philip
pines became . a part of the United
- States and that the constitution im
mediately extended over these new
possessions by its own force, and that
the people of those Islands are enti
tled to the blessings and Immunities
which that instrument gives to our
own people. When we became sover
eign in Porto Rico that island was
deprived of the freedom of trade with
Spain which it had before enjoyed.. It
is now proposed to deny them similar
freedom of trade with the United
States, thus hemming them In from all
markets. The policy is unjust."
kins, Simon of Oregon declared that he
should vote against the pending measure.
He did not regard it as a party measure,
and while he disliked to separate from the
majorltv on the Republican side of the
chamber, he felt fully justified in his
courae. He was assured, he said, that the
people of Oregon were entirely in accord
with him in opposing the measure. They
were, he said, earnestly In favor of free
trade between Porto Rico and the United
States, as a matter of good faith. He did
not think the enactment of the bill into
law would cause the loss of the State to
the Republican party, "but If there Is any
one act passed by this Congress that will
render it doubtful, this is the one."
Simon was proceeding to elaborate
what, he paid, had been promised to the
people of Porto. Rico, when he was Inter
rupted by Mr. Foraker.
"What single pledge or promise has
been made to the people of Porto Rico
which is not keDt in this hill?"
Simon was about to read what General
Miles had announced to /he islanders in
his proclamation when Foraker took the
worus out of his mouth, so to say, re
marking that the pending measure was
perfectly in line with the proclamation.
Spooner called attention to the fact that.
In any event, even If General Miles' prom
ises had not been kept, his proclamation
would in no sense be binding on Congress.
Simon took the prrotind that the propos
ed act was a serious party blunder, as
well as wrong in itself. He maintained
that the people of the island were under
our flag, and, therefore. It should not be
held for colonial exploitation. The asser
tion of our power to levy the proposed
tariff was in violation of a tacit, but well
understood, agreement with them, and he
could not, therefore, give it hls'svpport.
After a brief executive session the Sen
ate at 6:25 p. m. adjourned until 11 o'clock
to-morrow.

JOE PETE ESCAPES.
Indian Murderer Burrows His Way
Out of the Genoa Jail.
Special Dispatch to The Call. â¢
CARSON, Nev., April 2.â Word was re
ceived here last night announcing the
escape from the Genoa Jail of Joe Pete,
the Indian murderer of William Dang
berg. Pete Is under sentence of death,
the date of execution being set for May
4. Governor Sadler refused to interfere
In the case last week, and Pete's attor
neys now have the case before the Su
preme Court for a new trial. Pete made
his escape by digging under the Jail, and
he covered the excavation with the bed
ding in his cell. He had evidently been
gone many hours before the discovery
,was made, as his breakfast was un
touched and the discovery was made
when dinner was brought.
Pete is considered one of the worst In
dians in Western Nevada, and will make
a fight for his life. His tribesmen fear
him, and will not lend assistance In his
capture. A posse left for the mountains,
but failed to locate the murderer. . Sher
iff Brockless has offered a reward for the
capture of the Indian.
Will Issue Snow Bulletins.
The local Weather Bureau, under the di
rection of Professor McAdie. Is compiling
statistics which will be of no little value
to the miners and farmers dependent upon
Irrigation for their water supply. Postals
have been sent to all of the Postmasters
in the mountain districts requesting in
formation as to the amount of snow that
has fallen this winter and how it com
pares with the amount of other seasons,
whether it lies solid or light and the
amount comparatively that remains.
About 500 answers have been received, and
these indicate that the fall of snow this
year is much smaller than usual.
From all appearances the storm, of tho
past day or so may continue for half a
day or more longer. Weather Â¦ Prophet
McAdie of the local Weather Bureau says
the storm came in from the northwest,
working its way south as far as Fresno.
Central and Northern California got a
good wetting. In the San Joaquin Valley
the rain was particularly beneficial. At
noon yesterday Professor McAdie stated
that the storm was working its way to
the east, but that rain and showers would
be likely to prevail for thirty-six hours
or more.
STOCKTON. April 2.â Rain commenced
falling shortly before midnight and it soon
developed into a regular downpour. The
Indications are that it will be the heaviest
precipitation of the storm.
SAN JOSE, April 2.â There was a heavy
downpour of rain this morning and some
more this evening. Much good will be done
by the shower. Total for the storm, .32 of
an inch; for the season, 13.05; last season,
12.95.
Eddie Gardiner Defeated.
NEW YORK. April 2.â Dave Sullivan of
Boston and Eddie Gardiner of "Wheeling,
W. Va., fought a hard battle before the
Hercules Athletic Club of Brooklyn 'to
night. They met at 124 pounds. After Sul
livan had been practically knocked out in
the sixteenth round he came again and
had Gardiner so groggy in the nineteenth
round that tho latter's brother Oscar, the
"Omaha Kid." Jumped into the ring and
threw up the sponge to save Eddie from
being knocked out. :.
Hernandez Again Defeated.
CARACAS, "Venezuela, April 2.â The
revolutionist General ,Hernandez has
been obliged to retreat to the banks of the
Orinoco, having suffered a new and de
cisive overthrow sixteen miles from Ciu
dad â¢ Bolivar.- $***&
a auarrel and the culmination was that Colo
nel Marceau obtained a divorce from Mrs.
Marceau on the ground of desertion. Since
that time Colonel Marceau has paid $50 a month
for the support of his child. A short time ago
the health of the child, who was then in the
custody of "Mama" Hall, resulted in Colonel
Marceau coming to this city. He called upon
me and said he wished to gain possession of
his child under any circumstances. A few
days later Mrs. Marceau informed me over the
telephone that she would like to ccc Colonel
Marceau regarding the child.
Colonel Marceau refused to meet his ex-wlfe
until I threatened to withdraw from the case
unless he did so. The meeting took place and
an agreement was drawn up between Mrs. Mar
ceau and the colonel by which the colonel was
to taKe the child to Lios Angeles for his health.
Subsequently Mr. and Mrs. Marceau met and
his actions were Buch as tt> raise- the hope In
her mind that the interest and health of the
child would result in a reconciliation between
them. When she heard that Colonel Marceau.
after reaching Los Angeles, characterized the
statements that they would be married as "all
bosh" and "rot." etc., she became excited and
hurried to Los Angeles. She took the child and
endeavored to brlns it home to San Francisco,
but was apprehended by the police. She has
returned to Los Angeles and the legal nght is
low on between them.
An important legal point remains, that
is not generally known. It is .thought that
Colonel Marceau In removing the child
from the custody of its legally appointed
guardian acted in contempt of court. As
a matter of fact after he and Mrs. Fen
nell had made their agreement they called
on Judge Troutt and submitted the docu
ment. The Judge thereupon so modified
his decree that Colonel Marceau was au
thorized to remove the child from the cus
tody of its guardian, Mrs. Hall and take
It, in the interest of its health, to any
destination he might select.

DR. TENNEY
SAYS HE WAS
MISQUOTED
*
San Jose Teachers Attend
Meeting of Pastors'
Union.
Alleged Attempt to Drag the Schools
Into Politics Is Denounced by
Preachers and Pedagogues
Are Satisfied.
Â»
Br^clal Dispatch to The Call
BAN JOSE, April 2.â There was a lively
meeting of the Pastors' Union at th*
First Presbyterian Church this morning
in which city politics was the feature.
This was a sort of aftermath of the
meeting of pastors last week, when th*
gang was denounced for meddling in tne
city school affairs and their conduct of
municipal matters generally. The teach
ers had take, n exception to Rev. Mr. Ten*
ney's remarks as they appeared in some
of the local papers. He was credited
with saying "the city schools are a dis
grace to the community." A committee
consisting of City Superintendent Rus
seil. Professor Bruch and Miss Emma
Ringo were present In behalf of the
teachers, and wanted to know Just what
had been said.
Rev. J. E. Squires presided at the meet-
Ing. The meeting was opened with a
prayer by W. M. Parsons of the Young
Men's Christian Association, who asked
a divine blessing on the city and that
"decency in city and county government
be made to prevail."
Rev. Mr. Tenney read a statement ot
what he actually had said. The reverend
gentleman declared he had never said
"the schools were a disgrace- to iiiout.ii
civilization," but that he had so referred
to the system of bossism that prevailed
in educational matters in this city. De
nial was given to the statement 1 that he
had said only a few teachers were com
petent, but he was satisfied that many,
If not most of them, were entirely com
petent and above reproach. He said the
Rea gang was endeavoring to make po
litical capital out of his remarks, and in
that way array the teachers against the
citizens' movement In the coming cam
paign. His friendship for teachers and
schools was reaffirmed, and the speaker
said the only desire of those in favor ot
good government was to see the teachers
freed from the bondage now suffered be
cause of boss control of the schools.
Superintendent Russell said the account
as printed in pome of the local papers
of Rev. Mr. ' Tenney's remark was a
grave indictment and could not be al
lowed to pass.
Rev. Mr. Thompson and others declared
Dr. Tenney had not made the remark ac
credited to him.
Rev. Mr. Squires and others denounced
the whole matter as the work of politi
cians to secure the support of the teach
ers for the coming election. Rev. Mr.
Maclaren was particularly stropg In these
denunciations.
Profr-ssor Huston, a member of the
Pastonj' Union, thought Mr. Tenney had
referred to the schools as a disgrace, but
he was not sure.
The following resolutions were adopted,
and -this satisfied the teachers' com
mittee:
Resolved, That any report or editorial which
represents Dr. Tenney*s remarks as antagonistic
or reflecting upon the teaching force of our
schools is misleading, untruthful and dishonest,
and be It
Resolved. That wi> Btrongly disapprove of the
effort? to <JraK the jschool teachers of San Jose
â¢-Oto the political campaign.
VThe teachers' committee will report
bick to the association at a meeting
Tiursday night, and a "love feast" will
pribably ensue. One of the pastors re.
ported that the teachers in his church
hac\ refused to shake hands with him
bectlise of these misrepresentations, and
the fphoolma ams have been real mad for
the -^hole week and have been boycot
ting ibe churches and raying all manner

BUrtlac U.â>,l, r.np.. T . Chicago, lUotr-t!, *?â¢Â» Tart. SIT
MARTSVIL.LE, April 2.â An unusually
heavy rain and hail storm visited Yuba
and Sutter counties to-day, commencing
with light showers during Sunday and last
night.
In the vicinity of Nicolaus, in Sutter
County, at 1 o'clock this afternoon during
a hailstorm there was a strange visitation
resembling a typhoon. A fierce wind hav
ing a path about fifty yards wide was first
noted at a point two miles south of
Nicolaus. It moved In a northeasterly
direction, and for a distance of about
seven miles it caused great surprise and
consternation among the farmers, so un
used to such a freak of the elements. As
it swept across the. county it destroyed
the barn, smokehouse, windmill tower and
other outhouses on the H. W. Tilton place,
and wherever it encountered trees it tore
them to pieces. Mrs. Tilton, who ran
from the house, frightened by the sudden
change, was compelled to cling to the
trunk of a tree in the yard or be thrown
forcibly to the ground. The hurricane
seemed to sweep the water from Coon
Creek Into a cloud, carrying it along quite
a distance. At the Pippin place,' where
there are many fruit trees, few escaped
whole. To the residents of Nicolaus the
disturbance resembled a cloud in the
shape of a kite's tail passing across the
heavens. It terminated near the Moore
head place.
KESWICK, April 2.â A cloudburst oc
curred here last night about 7 o'clock.
There had been light showers at Intervals
during the afternoon, which were Inter
spersed with spells of sunshine. At 5
o'clock there was no longer any Indication
of rain, but at 6 o'clock it came in such a
deluge as was never before seen In Kes
wick. In a few minutes the street ditches
were running torrents and the little rivu
lets made nillsldes look like sheets ot
water. In four minutes Spring Creek
at the road crossing to the depot had risen
five feet, obliterating all traces of the
dam at that point. In four minutes a
stream that could have been waded by a
child became one that teams and wagons
could not ford. To-day after an all night's
rain the stream has not reached the height
it attained In four minutes and lost in half
an hour.
GERMANTOWN. April 2.â A severe
storm passed over this region at about 2
o'clock to-day, which, although of short
duration, will be long remembered. Hail
stones as large as pigeons'i eggs fell,
stampeding stock and otherwise interfer
ing with business for about half an hour,
and during .that time about half an inch
of water fell. Although much grain was
knocked down little damage will probably
result unless the weather should become
warm within the next few days. The
storm was accompanied by thunder and
lightning and all that saved the north
windows was the absence of any great
amount of wind. The farmers greatly
needed the moisture and In the end more
good than harm will result. Nearly one
and a half inches of rain has fallen
within the last two days, making the total
for the season 14 Inches, against 10.97 to
the same date last year.
LODI, April 2.â The heaviest hall storm
in years fell here to-day. The hail came
down in sheets. Hailstones fell in such
quantities that in some fields the ground
was covered to a depth of six inches, pre
senting an appearance of having been vis-
Ited by a snowstorm. A few miles south
of this place hailstones came down with
such force that windows were broken,
trees denuded of their fruit . and grain
beat to the ground. An alfalfa patch was
laid flat and a five-acre almond orchard
was stripped to the last nut. Grapevines
In the storm zone were broken and de
nuded of all the young shoots. The rain
falling before and after the hailstorm was
the heaviest which this section has wit
nessed in April in five years.
LOS ANGELES, April 2.â A trace of
rain fell to-night. Crops are too far gone
to be benefited by a continuous down
pour.
SACRAMENTO. April 2.â Fruit men
state that the present rainfall will do no
injury to the orchards and that It will be
generally beneficial. There have been two
or three light showers to-day. There has
been no rain In the past 48 hours from Cas
cade to Reno, but Summit. Cascade, Cisco.
Emigrant Gap and Blue Canyon have had
snow, three inches falling at Cascade. It
was snowing this morning from Emigrant
Gap to Truckee. D*lta and Dunsmuir got
the greatest amount of rain and it was
raining at both these places this morning.
Three inches had been precipitated at
Delta during the storm, making 64.05 inches
for the season.
REDWOOD CITY. April 2.â Rain com
menced to fall here early this morning,
and for several hours a heavy downpour
blessed this part of the county. The farm

SCORES OF MEN
IN SECRET PLOT
Governor Steunenberg Gives Al
leged Details of the Wardner
Conspiracy.
Sensational Disclosures Which He Claims
Were Made by James R. Sovereign
to a Friend.
WASHINGTON. April 2.â The chief In
terest in Governor Steunenberg's testi
mony before the Coeur d'Alene investiga
tion to-day was In his continuance of the
recital begun at the last session of the
committee of the disturbed conditions
prior to the uprising cf April last. He
had been asked by Representative Dick
why he refused to disband the militia of
the Coeur d'Alene district in 1597, as had
hovn requested by the County Commis
sioners. He said that at the time the of
ficers of the Western Federation of Min
ers were advising the arming of the un
ions, ar.d be had an address by one of
these officials stating that "every union
Fhould have a rifle club," and that "in
two years we can hear the Inspiring mv-
Fie of 25.000 armed men In the ranks of
labor."
Governor Stuenenberg 6ald that, follow
ing this, there were evidences In the
Coeur <I'Alene district that the advice was
being followed. A body of armed and
masked men, he paid, appr-ajed at Mullan
and compelled the delivery of a large sup
ply of arms and ammunition owned by
the State of Idaho, and stored there
peodlÃff the organization of a militia com
pany. He began correspondence and in
quiry, and could get no tracp of the arms
or those who took them. When he ap
plied to the local Sheriff, the latter an
s^'^red. in effect, for him to "mind his
own business."
The Governor said that about the same
time he received a letter from the Grand
Army of tht Republic commander at
Murray, stating that a number of rifles
a.nd ammunition were in danger of being
ftolen. Threats had been made to seize
them, and a notification had been served
that they would be taken. The Grand
Army of the Republic asked to be relieved
of further responsibility, and the Gover
nor said he had the arms boxed and
ehlpped away.
Governor Â£teunenbÂ«rg said he sent Ad
jutant General French to CoÂ«ur d'Alenes,
a.nd hf reported that a movement was on
foot for miners to come to Wardner on
the disbanding of the militia and dyna
mite th* Bunker Hill mine. There were
repeated threats, the Governor Eaid. that
the Â«'SiciaJs of the mine would be mur
dered if they did not escape before the
Canyon Creek miners came down. He
said h<? was shocked to learn that Fred
rri''k B. Whitney, superintendent of the
Frisco mine, had been taken from his
room at nirht by sixteen armed and
macked men. marched down the) creek
and shot, dying in a day or two.
Details of the Conspiracy.
A stir was caused in the committee
room when Governor Steunenberg, In an
swering a question as to what he knew of
a conspiracy in connection with the blow
ing up of the Bunker Hill mill, said:
"I learned that Ed Boyce, president of
the Western Federation of Miners, was
In the country ten days before the explo
sion at the Bunker Hill and Sullivan
mills, and at that time he Inaugurated or
perfected this conspiracy by choosing
twenty men from the different organiza
tions in that country and swearing them.
These twenty men chose one each and
swore him, and the forty each chose a
man and swore him, and the eighty each
chose a man and swore him. In that way
there were at least 160 men in this con
spiracy to do this thing, all sworn to se
crecy."
Representative Hay of Virginia ques
tioned the Governor sharply as to his
sources of information. The Governor
hesitated, and then said:
"I learned these facts from James R.
Sovereign, through a mutual friend."
When Hay wanted the name of the
friend there was some question as to giv
ing the name, but the Governor finally
gave it as A. B. Campbell.
Hay asked If Campbell were In the
committee room, and the answer came
that he was. Sovereign also was present.
The Governor said he had not been able
to get further evidence, as the people who
lived In the country were afraid they
would be assassinated If they were
known to have given any Information.
At the afternoon session Hay moved to
strike out all of Governor Steunenberg's
testimony of events prior to the conspi
racy. This motion was defeatedâ s to 2
Dick concluded the redirect examination',
and in the absence of Lentz, Robertson,
private counsel for those making the
charges, renewed the cross-examination
of the Governor. It covered much ex
planatory detail on the events previously
testified to. He said he did not charge
the death of Superintendent Whitney to
the miners' unions.
Late In the day Governor Steunenberg"s
testimony was completed after he had
been on the stand twelve days, and he
was excused.
Brigadier General W. P. Carlin, U. S. A.
(retired), was the next witness. He testi
fied that he was in command of the
United States troops in the Coeur d'Alene
district during the trouble in 1592. and
pave a recital of the disturbed condition
there. General Carlin will continue when
the investigation is resumed to-morrow.

LOS ANGELES. April 2.â When Mrs.
Fiske-Marceau-Fennell stepped from the
owl train this morning in charge of Sher
iff Bogwardt of Kern County, who held
her under a complaint that had been
granted in the name of Colonel Marceau,
she was confronted by her former hus
band and his friends. It is well that she
tightly hugged to her heart her baby boy
as she alighted as it had been planned
to take the child as soon as she arrived
in this city. An attempt was made at
River Station, where the Colonel Marceau
party boarded the train.
"You cannot take that boy from Its
mother as long as she is in my hands,"
Sheriff Bogwardt said, "and I shall carry
out the provision of the law. So keep
your hands off."
The Kern County official escorted the
party, including Allen Fiske, who had
been given his liberty as the train passed
Lancaster, to the private office of Sheriff
Hammil in the county building. Here
a brief consultation followed between C.
"W. Pendleton, representing Mrs. Fennell,
the District Attorney, Justice James and
Sheriff Hammil.
"I regret that I must exact a bail bond
from you, Mrs. Fennell, to prevent
further annoyance or restraining your
liberty," Sheriff Hammil said in a tone
that indicated respect for his fair charge.
"Sir I have every respect for* the law
and its ofllcers," Mrs. Fennell answered
In a decided tone, "but 1 shall not ask
my friends who surround me to sign their
names to a single document, nor will I
deposit one dollar for my release from
custody. If Colonel Marceau can afford
to see "the mother of his child go behind
prison bars for love of her child the
mother Is more than willing to submit to
this humiliation for the love she bears
their baby."
Mrs. Fennell at this conclusion of for
malities was released upon her own recog
nizance and is installed in a suite at the
Nadeau.
Pending the arrival of Justice James,
who Issued the complaint. Colonel Mar
ceau arrived at the county building and
entered the room where Mrs. Fennell sat
with young Theo In her lap. .; . -
"Hello, Theo, come here and see your
papa." the colonel cheerily said. The boy
slid from his mother's lap and the colonel
strode out with his son. Not a word
passed between the parents, no glances
were exchanged, nothing thrilling hap
penedânot even a sigh escaped from the
little woman who, with a hand clasped
over her aching heart, sat alone in the
castle of the law.
Detective George Good has been retained
by Colonel Marceau to guard young Theo
dore so that he may not again fall Into
the hands of his mother or persons of
whom he is most suspicious.
From out of the mass of legal formality
into which this alleged kidnaping case has
so quickly been plunged Justice James has
decided that the preliminary examination,
of Mrs. Fennell under the warrant
served at Bakersfleld shall be heard April
20. Another phase has been added to the
situation by Mrs. Fennell through her
attorney in applying for a writ of habeas
corpus. This order was granted late this
afternoon by Judge York of the Superior
Court and is returnable to-morrow at 9
o'clock, at which hour young Theo will be
produced in court.
Pendleton, the plaintiff's attorney, will
press the case and it is expected that the
hearing will center around the question
whether the stipulation entered into on
March 23 between Mrs. Fennell and the
colonel In San Francisco before Judge
Troutt made the father the legal custo
dian of the boy.
"I do not regret the step I took yester
day." Mrs. Fennell said at a late hour
to-night. "I wanted my boy, and the
longer I had him the greater grew my
anxiety to keep him. I do not think I
was wrong in the measure I took of
Colonel Marceau in our last Interview at
the Belmont. His tone indicated that he
was not deeply In earnest and sincerity
was absent when I told him I had come
to him in response to his request and his
promise for us to be reunited for the sake
of the boy. I felt he had fooled me and
forced me Into a position where I un
guardedly surrendered my child In keep
ing with a plan he concocted.
"He broke his agreement, hence the
child reverted to me and I started for my
home with my baby. If Colonel Marceau
regarded me at all he would not have
taken my baby from my arms this morn-
Ing and would have permitted me to kiss
my baby. Every action shows that ho
wants only the child and he has resorted
to these drastJc measures. I shall now
battle for my 'boy fnd I believe if Theo
were asked with wMom he wished to live
and the rourts would abide by his words
I would be able to return to San Fran
cisco to-morrow night. So repugnant is
the thought of a reunion with the colonel
that I have entirely lost sight of that
feature." . .â¢Â¦;.
Colonel Marceau has not been on the
streets to-day. His friends insist that on
many occasions during the past week he
has reiterated the statement that he never
Intended to remarry Mrs. Fennell.
At 9 o'clock to-night Mrs. Fpnnell, ac
companied by Sheriff. Bogwardt, visited
the home of her attorney, where a con
sultation lasting several hours was held.
MARCEAU'S ATTORNEY
OUTLINES HIS POSITION
Attorney Van R. Paterson last night
made the following statement regarding
the troubles of Colonel Marceau and his
ex- wife: Â¦

BOHEN RETIRED BY
THE COMMISSIONERS
AS was expected, the Police Commls
plonerp, meeting as a pension
board, yesterday afternoon retired
Captain of Detectives Bohen. The
latter has been connected â¢with the
Police Department since 18G0 and anx
iously Bought to be placed on the retired
list. The other retirements were as fol
lows: Detective Roy Sllvey, Sergeants
Llndhelmer . and Shields and Patrolmen
Dnn Coleman, John Morton and Dan Mc-
Neil.
It Is understood that Captain Seymour
will he appointed to take the place of
Captain Bohen. The vacancy caused by
the retirement of Detective Sllvey will In
all probability be filled by Tom Ryan, the
clever sleuth of the Southern Station.
Captain Seymour, who will In all prob
ability succeed Bohen, Is one of the
cleverest men in the department. He was
appointed captain of police a short time
ago and placed in charge of the City
Prison. Prior to his promotion he was
a detective and was noted for his shrewd
ness. It was mainly through his efforts
that Theodore Durrant, the brutal mur
derer of Minnie Williams and Blanche
Lamont, was convicted and hanged.
Detective" Silvey has been ailing for
some time and was unable to do police
duty. He was afflicted with a stomach
trouble and as his case seemed) hopeless
the Commissioners decided to place- him
on the retired list. For a number of years
Silvey has been associated with Detective
Egan. Their duties were to look out for
pickpockets and bunko men. It Is said
of Sllvey that he has arrested more purse
snatchers than any other man in the Po
lice Department.
Sergeant Linrtheimer has been acting as
desk sergeant in the City Prison for over
twenty years, and was looked upon as one
of the most conscientious men in the de
partment. His retirement Is attributed to
old age, although Lindheimer, notwith
standing that he Is over 60 years, is con
sidered one, of the most efficient members
of tho force. Ooleman and Morton have
grown old in the service, and at their re
quest they were placed- on the retired list.
McNeil is over 80 years of age and is
unable to do police duty. He petitioned
the board to be placed on the pension roll.
At the suggestion of Chief or Police Sul
livan final action in the matter of retire
ments was postponed until next Monday.
At that time the men. who are selected to
su win oe xormauy nour.ea 01 me aciiuu
of the board.
It Is understood that Lieutenant Esola
will succeed Seymour as captain of the
prison.
After agreeing on the men who Â¦were to
be retired the matter of the application
of all persons who are interested in the
Hotel Nymphla wan taken up by the Com
missioners. Attorney Joe Dunne, who ap
peared for the lessee of the place, made
an appeal on behalf of his client, claiming
that it was a rank injustice to close the
place.
Commissioner Wallace said that as far
as he was concerned the Nymphia would
remain closed. Commissioner Newhall.
after referring to the closing of the Hotel
Nymphla, moved that Bacon place be
closed. Chief Sullivan explained that the
women of the houses on Bacon Dlace had
agreed to abide by the regulations of tho
Police Department and seemed anxious
to keep within the purview of the law.
After some further discussion final action
was postponed until the next regular
meeting.

Franklin Grand Jury Urged to Im

FRANKFORT, Ky., April 2.â The April
term of the Franklin Circuit Court and
the Grand Jury working under It, which
will investigate the assassination of Gov
ernor Goebel, began work this afternoon.
Judge Cantrill's charge to the Grand Jury
was surprisingly brief. He said:
"You know the terrible situation in this
county better than I can depict it. I hope
and believe this Grand Jury, realizing the
responsibilities resting upon it, will dis
charge its entire duty fearlessly, fairly
and impartially and if it does no man or
set of men can lay complaint at your door
when your labors terminate."
While nothing was said by Judge Can
trill in his charge concerning It, it is un
derstood that Commonwealth's Attorney
Franklin will recommend the bringing in
of indictments against Republican Gov
ernor Taylor and all of the Republican
State officers, on the charge of usurpation
of the offices they are claiming to hold.

CARPENTERS STRIKE
FOR INCREASED PAY
Several Thousand Men Quit in New
York and Neighboring New
Jersey Towns.
NEW YORK, April 2.â Several thousand
men In the city, neighboring towns In
New Jersey and Westchester County, N.
V.. struck to-day for increases In wages
and shorter hours. Most of the strikers
are carpenters, and the enormous amount
of building in progress favors the men.
In the borough of Bronx the carpenters
demand $3 50 a day for eight hours' work,
with a Saturday half holiday, and in
Mount Vcrnon they ask $3 25 for the
same work. In Newark, N. J., the car
penters demand $3 a day for eight hours.
They now get' $2 S5 for a nine-hour day.
The men are well organized, and the
contractors are not making a unitea
stand. Indeed, there is a general dispo
sition to compromise with the strikers,
and not a few employers have con
ceded the scale presented. Painters, dec
orators and plumbers also struck in the
neiÃhboring towns. Manhattan Island
and Brooklyn are practically exempt from
labor troubles, and not many men in the
building trades are idle. The surprise of
the day was the strike of several hun-
dred Italian laborers employed In Rye
and Port Chester. Some demand $1 50 for
elsrht hours and others asked $2 for the
same hours. An early settlement of all
the strikes is likely.

MORE ROOM FOR
THE GRAVES OF
FALLEN HEROES
Space on the Presidio Hill
Becoming More and
More Scarce.
It Is Itemed Advisable to Prepare
Another Tract Adjoining the
Present National Ceme
tery for Bodies.
Â»
The hundreds of dead brought back
from Manila and interred in the National
Cemetery at the Presidio is crowding the
capacity of the cemetery to such a de
gree that the hitherto imused portion of
the tract of fifteen acres reserved for the
nation's dead will be laid out for graves
before the summer is over.
There is still room in the cemetery for
at least nine hundred more bodies, exclu
sive of that portion set aside for the bod
ies of officers, but still the department haa
decided that the entire cemetery tract
must be opened.
There are now over two thousand heroes
sleeping peacefully on the slope, a great
portion of which number has been the
fruit of the war in the Philippines. Most
of the bodies brought back have been
sent on East at the request of relatives of
the dead, but what were left have been
and are being buried on the Presidio hill
side at the rate of from six to twenty a
day. There are still nearly two hundred
bodies awaiting burial at the post, and
most of these will find a resting place in
the National Cemetery.
The cemetery as at present laid consists
of something over eight acres. There were
fifteen acres laid out for it. but only the
present tract was prepared for burials. All
of cne side of this is now tilled, and a good
part of the other side, but the superin
tendent estimates that there is still room
to bury all that will come to the gates for
the next two years at leastâ that is un
less the Philippine, war begins again to
swell its list of casualties. But so as to
be ready when the old cemetery can house
no more, the new tract will be thrown
open as soon aa possible. Already the wall
that once encompassed the eight acres is
being extended to take in the whole fif
teen, and the engineers are daily expected
to visit the graveyard to survey it and
submit plans for laying it out. The plans
will go on to Washington and the work
will be ordered from there.
In the meantime the Governors of the
various States have been called on to say
if they will not take care of the dead of
their separate States. Washington and
Oregon have notified the depot quarter
master to hold the bodies of all Wash
ington and Oregon soldiers at the orders
of their States, the intention being to
bury them at home. Other States will
probably follow the same course.
PENSION PLAN
HELD AS BAIT TO
OLD EMPLOYES
Collis P. Huntington's New
Scheme to Give Weight to
His Relief Bureau.
Large Grievance Committees of Five
Brotherhoods Holding Meetings
in City â General Confer
ence on "Wednesday.
Collis P. Tluntington fhows his usual
cunnlngness in trying to foist upon the
employes of the Southern Pacific system
his relief bureau. The most vigorous
protest has come from the older employ cb,
who have been almost lifelong members
of the various brothtrh<x>ds. They have
not been openly aggressive, but the inlla
ence upon the younger members has been
tremendous. Huntington has sought to ofr
t-et this by causing a report to be circu
lated quietly that the relief bureau is
only a forerunner to a pension system by
which employes who have spent a certain
number of years in the employ of the
company will be retired upon pay Fuiti
rieut to enable them to live comfortably
for the remainder of thtir days.
The bait will prove a templing one, but
it is not likely to be taken. As yet not

a rumor, but circulated with such skill
that it appears to be an implied promise.
Already thÂ« deceit has beer, detected ami
men are busy combating its influence.

*\ H. Ron riven of Tucsrn. Ariz., is at the

at the Orand Hotel, and the brotherhoods
of conductors, trainmen and telegraphers
met at Â£W Post street.
The meetings were all executive and af
ter they were over the numbers seemed
disinclined to discuss their plans. From
what could be learned, however, it is be
lieved that when the men meet with C. P.
Huntington to discuss the relief plan they
will take a firm stand acalnst all such
portions of the article a? in their opinion
jire likely to destroy the brotherhoods, j
The compulsory clause must be t:Ucen out j

rapid eating, the indigestible pastry,
the coffee and pie or dougUnuls,

that city and the Middle West, entered a com
plaint before the Interstate Commerce I'oraralt
teÂ«\ demanding that the existing freight rates
on commodities in carload lots be changed,, so
as to render them more nearly equal, and a\cu
that freight rates to the Pacific Coast and ta
intermediate points be graduated according to
distance, irrespective of water competition;
and.
Whereas, Such a change, while working a
great Injury to the Jobbing interests of this
coast, will be of no service to the consumer â for
It is not asked cr contended that rate Fhrnild be
lowered, but merely that they should be t-f,u:il
iw>d â nor to the retailer, who now gets the
benefit of the wholesalers' carload rate to thy
coast, which would erase to exist If the pro
posed change were effected. Therefore, be It
Resolved. By the Chamber of Commerce of I-os
Aniseies. whose membership of 1000 includes
wholesalers, manufacturers, retailers and the
general consumer alike, that the proposed
change is. according to our view, lalse in prin
ciple and Iniquitous in its practical results, and
is- detrimental to the commercial Interests of the
section we represent, and that we do therefore
enter- our protest against it to the Interstate
Commerce Commission and urge that the pres

Mr. Holbrook stated that prior to the
completion of the railroad lie had re
ceived all of his goods by sea. Back in
ISM the local merchants reached the con
clusion that the railroad was not treat
ing them right and started two ship lines
of their own â one by the Isthmus and the
other via Cape Horn. The outcome of this
action was a rate war that enabled the
St. Louis jobbers to get a foothold on the
coast. Â¦ Differentials were almost entirely
eliminated and many of the competing
iines went into the hands of receivers.
He stated that the encroachment on this
territory of the Middle West jobbers had
gradually reduced the area of trade of
tile Pacific Coast wholesalers. He said
that whereas the latter formerly carried
on an extensive business with Idaho,
Utah. Montana, Washington and Oregon
retailers, this had been grabbed up by
the Middle West dealers by reason of
their railroad facilities being more favor
able than those on the coast.

Anti-Lottery Order.
Upon the request of Chief of Police Sul
livan Supervisor Tobin introduced an or
der which was passed to print, intended
to. prohibit lottery and lottery drawings.
It reads as follows:
Section I. It shall be unlawful for any per
son io pass, give or deliver to another, or cir
culate any papers, writings, prints, bills, hand
bills, cards, instruments or devices which ex
clusively purport to be or represent to be copies
statements or memoranda of a lottery drawing!
or which exclusively purport to be or repre
sented to be statements, declarations,, copies or
memoranda or lists of the lucky or winning
characters, number* or figures In or of a lot
tery or In or of a lottery drawing.
Sec. 2. Any person violating any of the pro
visions of this ordinance shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine
of not more than $500, or by Imprisonment for
six months, or both. . . sTi.: -.
Another ordinance in this connection,
which was also passed to print, prohibits
the possession of lottery tickets, papers,
stamps, tools, instruments or devices.
In the face of strong and decided pop
ular opinion against the re-establishment
of horse racing, with its many attendant
evils, in this city. Supervisors Helms and
McCarthy had the temerity at yesterday's
meeting of the board to introduce two or
dinances which are especially designed to
legalize the equine sport within the city
and county. Both ordinances were pre
sented by their authors in a quiet, unos
tentatious way. and were referred to the
Police Committee, which will report its
recommendation, favorable or unfavora
ble, at the next meeting of the board.
There was no discussion of the two
measures, probably on the principle that
the least said about the iniquitous meas
ures the better.
Helms' order cannot be taken seriously
and no one takes it that way. There is no
order now prohibiting legitimate horse
racing and no reason exists for Jt s . '"^ r Â°
dur-Uon. Every man, woman and cniia in
the community is in favor of legitimate
contests between fleet-footed animals. The
ministers themselves have never voiced
their sentiments against horseracing itself,
but their efforts have been directed to
ward destroying the pernicious gambling
which accompanies the sport. Helms âor
rather McQuaide'sâ order therefore means
nothing and is intended only to befuddle
the public mind and draw it away from
the main issue In the case, that of per
mitting gambling at racetracks. The or
dinance is us follows:
Section 7. It shaJl \>e unlawful for any per
son or person*, copartnership, association,- or
Â¦corporation, either as owner, agent. lessee or
manag*r. of any race track, lnciosure or fair
ground within the Â«/lty and county of San Fran
clsÂ»o to cause, procure or permit any horse
race fir races, or contest or contexts of skill,
speed or power of endurance between horses to
occur or be given cr helii within any one such
race track. Inrlosure r,r fair grounds for more
than sixty days In ary one year, or at any time
without first paying '.he license provided for in
this ordinance. Â«
Sec. 2. Every owner, agent, lessee or man
ater <.t any race track, lnciosure " or fair
grounds in the city and county of San Fran
cisco ?hall pay Â«. license for each and every day
a hirÂ»" rsro or races or contest or contests of
Kklli. 1 : speed or power of endurance between
hors** Is given or held or shall occur thereon or
there* of the sum of J4O.
Pec. (5. Any person or .persons, copartnership.
arsoclUion or corporation who shall violate any
of the' provisions of this ordinance shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
convlcti4n thereof shall be punished by a fine
of not fljore thÂ»n $500 or by Imprisonment of
not morf .than six months, or by both Euch fine
and lmr-tsonment.
McCarthy's ordinance, which commend
ably prohibits the selling of pools within
the city *nd county on" any kind of con
test, is directed toward the downtown
bucket sh*ps and poolrooms, but It con-
tains one. fatal exception, which is certain
to encompass its defeat. It legalizes pool
selling and registering of bets on horse
races for fifty days in one year, but only
within the lnciosure when; the horse races
are actually taking place. In other words,
McCarthy seeks to present the Eastern
syndicate of gamblers with a monopoly of
the gambling on racing and give it the
exclusive right in this city and county to
filch the dollars from the public.
While both ordinances arc evidently in
tended t,o limit the period of racing the
language is fatally defective therein, for
there is nothing to prevent other race
tracks or grounds from being constructed,
and as the restriction is placed only on
any one lnciosure the consequence would
be that racetracks would spring up like
mushrooms and the city would be deluged
with an army of gambling vultures, all
seeking to rob the unwary.
McCarthy's ordinance reads as follows:
To Protect Track Gamblers.
Section I. It shall be unlawful, except an
herein provided, for any person, firm or cor
poration In the city and county of San Fran
cisco, to lease, rent, let or keep any room,
shed, tenement, booth, building, tent or other
premises, or to occupy or use the same for
the purpose of registering or making bets,
wafers or selling of ikv>ls in any form, or to
contract or to receive any money, or anything
representing money. In any capacity what
ever, for the purpose of making, placing,
recording or registering any bet or wager, or
making any bet or pool upon the final or con
tingent result of any event, of any kind what
soever, whether said event takes place either
within or without this State, and whether said
event Is then actually occuring, or Is about
to occur: provided, however, that this ordi
nance Is not designed to prohibit horse racing,
and. therefore. It shall be lawful within any
racetrack In the city and county of San Fran
cisco to which an admission fee Is charged to
engage In said poolselllnir and registering of
bets, for a period not to exceed fifty (50) days
in ar.y one year, and during the said fifty (50)
days such poolKelllng and betting may be per
mitted, but only upon horse races then actually
occurring upon said racetrack.
Sec. 2. Any person, firm or corporation vio
lating any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by
a fine of five hundred ($500) dollars, or by Im
prisonment for the term of six (6) months, or
by both such fine and imprisonment.
In glaring contradiction to the ordi
nances intended to legalize gambling
on horse racing was the ordinance
introduced by Supervisor Comte by
which it is intended to prohibit gambling:
by cards, dice or any device for money,
checks or credits, -and Is especially direct
ed against the nickel-in-the-slot card ma
chines and mechanical contrivances
which overrun the city. The measure fol

SAX FRANCISCO merchants began
yesterday to add their testimony to
that of other Pacific Coast mercan
tile men in support of the contention
now under consideration by the In
terstate (.jgmmerce Commission that the
pl*-a of the St. Louis jobbers to have the
existing differentials readjusted is aimed
at the extinction of the local wholesalers.
The members of the commission who are
hearing t"he evidence are Martin A. Knapp
of New York (chairrr.ani. Judson C. Clem
ents of Georgia. James D. Yeomans of
lowa "and Joseph W. Kifer of Illinois.
These Easternets are an energetic lot.
When they have work before them they
believe in disposing of it without any un
necessary loss of time. They met yester
day morning at 11 o'clock in the I'nited
States Circuit Court room in the Apprais
er's building, continued their first session
until 1 o'clock in thÂ«- afternoon, adjourned
i:nt!l 2 to take a bite, resumed business
promptly at .the appointed hour, listened
attentively to the witnesses -until aftÂ»r 5
p. m. and thru shocked the local mer
chants and the San Francisco attorneys
interested by suggesting that the proceed
ings be resumed at 9 o'clock this morning.
SuÂ«h an early start was a little too much
for the Californ'ans. and when they re
covered from their surprise they begged
for a compromise, which was agreed to
by fixing the time of meeting- this morning
at W o'clock.
E. S. Pillsbury represented the Pacific
Coast jobbers bt-fort; the commission, and
W. r\ llerrin was on hand to pee that the
Southern Pacific Company got none the
worse of the controversy. Tlie interests
rf the St. Ixrais jobbers were looked after
by H. L. Christie.
The hardware trade was the only branch
of the whotewile business that was con
sidered yesterday. Charles Holbrook of
Holbrook. Merrill & Stetson and A. C.
Kulofson. connected with Baker & Ham
ilton, were the only witnesses examined.
Mr. Holbrook was rather conservative in
his statements, while Mr. Rulofson went
to the other extreme. Both agreed that
the steamships and clipper ships which
brini? merchandise to the coast are the
great factors in regulating freight rates
and are virtually the salvation of the local
jobbers.

ering freight rates, said Mr. HoJbrook,
"and increasing the differentials. Ship
ments by sea only compete with carload
lots by rail, by reason of the fact that
ships never make rates on small lots. To
meet that competition the railroad has
cut its carload rate, while the less than
carload rate has not been affected. The
present differentials are fair to all par
ties Interested and I think should be main
tained."
It was shown that many of the Middle
West jobbers, especially those who have
established branch houses here, are in
sympathy with the defense of the Pacific
Coast wholesalers. It was in evidence, in
opposition to the contention of the St.
Louis people that they were being un
justly discriminated against, that for a
given sum the St. Louis wholesalers could
ship twice as far West as the Pacific
Coast jobbers could East.
Mr. Holbrook testified that Mr. Hibbard
of St. Louis had told him that the object
of the Middle West jobbers in fighting for
a field on the Pacific Coast was to secure
a territory in which to work off their
surplus goods, which they were glad to
dispose of at a very small margin of
profit. They wanted the differentials re
duced so that they could add the differ
ence to their profits. The witness denied
in. positive terms that there was or ever
had been any agreement among the local
jobbers as to a scale of prices.
Says St. Louis Is Pirating.
"The Middle West man is not treatintr
us fairly." said Mr. Holbrook, in conclu
sion. "He is playing the pirate. We build
schools and churches and other public In
stitutions and pay our taxes, but these
people come here to take everything and
leave nothing. If the St. Louis mer
chant would come here on an equal foot
ing with us ami establish his business
house here we would welcome him â we
would throw the floors wide open to him â
but we draw the line at piracy.
Chairman Knapp assured the witness
that all the commission wanted was the
facts so that it could judge what was best
to do for the prosperity, progress and
husiness interests of every community in
volved.
A. C. Rulofson was decidedly pointed In
his testimony, especially when he referred
to the Southern Pacific Company. Much
of his testimony followed the lines of that
given by Mr. Holbrook.
"When freight rates are raised." he
said, "we increase the 'price only on
coarse goods, where the margin of profit
is small. In high-priced goods the extra
freight is absorbed in the profit. The Cali
fornia dealers do not take advantage of
the market as they do In the East. "We
are prompt to reduce prices, but very slow
to increase them."
He said he believed in patronizing the
steamer lines and sailing vessels as much
as possible. "It is a duty we owe our
selves," he continued, "and the onlymeans
we have of keeping the railroads in line.
Shipping by sea is the great regulator of
rates. If we did not have that advantage
it is hard to tell what the railroads would
not do to us."
He argued that St. Louis' fight was
aimed just as much at the Atlantic sea
board as the Pacific Coast and asserted
that the Middle West city was trying to
"make a little world all by Itself."
Mr. Rulofson turned his attention to an
exhibit furnished during the Los Angeles
session by Mr. Walte of St. Lkjuls. pur
porting to show freight rates paid, per
cent of profit, differentials, etc.. which are
enjoyed by the Middle West dealers. The
witness pulled Mr. Walte's compilations
to pieces and said that at best they were
only "the guess of an amateur."

SIENKIEWICZ'S
NOVEL IS PUT
ON TIE STAGE
"Quo Vadis" at the Alcazar
Draws a Large House
and Is a Hit.
"Manila Bound" Has Started a Run
at the Tivoli â Last Week of
the Present Morosco
Company.
*
Something happened at the Alcazar last
night. As many novel readers as the
house would held wtre there to see the
first performance of "Quo Vadis." and it
looks as if the "extraordinary expendi
tures" and "elaborate preparations" that
were made for this production would not
be in vain.
In view of the managerial effort one is
disposed to be lenient with the roughness
of a first night, and I am unwilling to
condemn the players for a somewhat cor
rugated performance, but hope they; will
attain to smoothness and artistic deli
cacy before the play enters upon the â th
week of its threatened run.
I can claim the distinction (almost
unique, I fancy) of not having read Sien
[ kiewicz"s novel, and I have not the heart
to heart feeling for the characters that
I vitalizes the "C2uo Vadis" cult, but I own
1 to a fondness for Petronius that I was
loth to have disturbed by seeing the Ar
biter Elegantiarum of Rome disguised as
Ernest Hastings, the arbiter elegantiarum
of O'Farrell street.
It is a delicate matter this, counterfeit
ing of personages of the past, who have
not been thrust on the stage so often and
variously that their true characters are
lost to sight in the mirror-maze of the
drama. I m!ght forgive some other actor
for tampering with my ideas of what I e
tronius should be if he succeeded merely
in giving the character some vitalityâ in
conveying something moro than the mere
intent of the lines: but Hastings does nei
ther, and it is only the words that he
speaks that have any dramatic value and
they are not overcharged with strength
or interest. . , ...
It Is so with the greater part of this
dramatization by Miss Jeanette Gilder,
from whose terrifying masculinity one
might expect to find the force and virility
of Sienkiewicz augmented and empha
sized. And yet she has made a play in
spite of the mass of superfluous dialogue
loaded into the six acts, in spite m the
abrupt transitions from one element of
the plot to another that occur without
warrant of art and little excuse of reason,
and in spite of the excessive sermonizing
which I judge, to be as much the fault orÂ«
the author as of the adapter.
She has made a play that is not only
didactic but dramatic as well, or I should
perhaps say melodramatic, for it contains
all the elements of melodrama and conse
quently of popularity.
Will J. Irvin is the only member of the
cast worthy of special mention. He is
much too loud at times as the impetuous
Tigellinus. but again he shows a marked
intelligence in some of his scenes. The
names of the characters are pronounced
J, many ways
Grand Opsra-House.
Millocker's "Beggar Student was pre
sented at the Grand Opera-house last
evening in a manner deserving of more
than ordinary praise, the scening and
costuming showing signs of taste, cars
and no little expenditure of money. The
opera is by no means new to the excellent
company, "and it went with a swing and
a dash that were really refreshing. Wolff,
Wooley. Goff and Perssw in the male roles
and Edith Mason. Bessie Fairbairn and
Hattte Belle Ladd being at their best.
Encores were numerous and there were
several curtain calls for Misses Ladd and
Mason and Messrs. Persse, Wolff and
Goff. The chorus was liberal as to num
bers and well drilled and the many tune
ful passages were given with a vim and
spirit that evoked the hearty applause of
the audience.
Tivoli.
"Manila Bound still proves an attrac
tion at the Tivoli Opera-house. Hartman
as the retired brewer furnishes most of
the fun and keeps the audience laughins
nearly all the time. At last evening's
performance the whole cast was in good
voice and each feature was liberally ap
plauded. The Tivoli management has in
preparation for next week the old operatic
favorite "The Bohemian Girl."
Beginning en April 16 "The Wizard of
the Nile," by the authors and composers
of "The Idol's Eye," will have the boards.
It is expected to win the same popular
favor as did the latter opera.

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
UPWARD of forty propositions for amending
the constitution of the United States have been
submitted at this session of Congress. A good
many of them are virtually duplicates and cover the
same subject, but still the variety of the whole is
large. Most of them were submitted early in the ses
sion, and it seemed at one time as if Congress might
spend the wmter in high arguments on constitutional
questions, for every Congressman who had an amend
ment vowed he would make the fight of his life to
bring it to the front and keep it there until a vote was
taken. â¢ Up to this time, however, nothing of note
has been done with regard to any of them, and their
only usefulness has- been to fill a pigeonhole.
The amendment of most general interest is that
providing for the election of United States Senators
by direct vote of the people. It has been before sev
eral Congresses and has once or twice passed the
House of Representatives. The arguments for it are
strong, and every year new ones arise. The dis
closures made in the investigation of the election of
Clark add to the popular demand for a change in the
system, and it is probable this amendment will even
tually be adopted. At any rate something will hay;
to be done to put an end to the evils of the present
system, and up to this time nothing better has been
devised than the proposed election by direct vote.
An amendment which seemed likely at one time to
go through both houses with a rush is that providing
that neither polygamy nor polygamous cohabitation
shall exist within the United States or in any place
subject to its jurisdiction. When the Roberts case
was before the public and constituted the chief sen
sation of the day this amendment was in high favor.
Of late it has seemingly been abandoned. It may be
that Congress has reached the conclusion that to press
it just at this time would seem unfriendly to our fel
low citizen, ally, subject or serf, whichever he may
be, the genial Sultan of Sulu, and accordingly h.ij
shelved it for a time until the Sultan feels more at
home with us and more ready to adopt our customs.
In both houses amendments have been offered giv
ing Congress power to levy taxes on incomes, an
other grants to Congress power to deal with trusts.
One proposes that the Presidential term of office be
fixed at six years and that the incumbent be ineligible
for re-election. An amendment which at one time
was much discussed authorizes Senators or Represen
tatives to hold seats in the Cabinet without forfeit
ing their seats in Congress. That would give us
Cabinet representation in Congress and would be
somewhat like the British system, but would hardly
fil well with the rest of our form of government
whose essential principle is that the legislative and
executive branches of government shall be wholly dis
tinct.
Two amendments prohibit to the State Legisla
tures a^ "well as to Congress the power to pass any
law respecting an establishment of religion, hindering
the free exercise thereof, or appropriating any money
in aid of any religious denomination or any institu
tion wholly or partly under ecclesiastical control.
Another of considerable note, and which has been
widejy advocated, confers upon Congress the power,
to establish uniform marriage and divorce laws

THE EUROPEAN COAL FAMINE.
ONE of the economic conditions of the time,
out of which far-reaching results may be ex
pected, i$ the so-called "coal famine" which
now prevails in Great Britain and Germany. The
famine does not mean an exhaustion of the coal
mines, t>ut only that in those countries a point has
been reached where the mines in many cases cannot
be profitably worked at the present price of coal.
Thus there has been brought about a famine in an
economic sense, and its effects have been almost the
saroe as if the mines had given out.
, The situation is not very bad in Great Britain,
owing to the facilities that country has for importing
coal, but according to reports from Germany the
shortage there has been disastrous. Thus we read
that in some localities not only, have the factories
closed for lack of fuel but even the schools have been
shut during the cold days of winter for the same rea
son. Moreover, it is said to have checked the work
in the Government shipyards, and according to some
estimates has caused upward of a million men to he
thrown out of employment. 'Â¦
There is doubtless a good deal of exaggeration in
most of these stories, but that there is a large and
growing need for coal in Europe is made evident by
the immense orders recently placed with American
coal dealers for a s"upplv. Thus it is said that a single
order has been recently given by a British syndicate
for 2,000,000 tons of Alabama coal, to be delivered at
New Orleans for export within- two years.
The situation is full of promise for the United
States, for as industry is now carried on, a shortage
of coal will mean a decrease in all kinds of industrial
power. With cheaper coal than Europe can obtain
we will have a great advantage in manufacturing of
all kinds, and the effects will greatly augment our in
dustrial wealth. There is no danger of any shortage
here for centuries to come, for according to one au
thority there is a "single mountain in Alabama con
taining enough coal to supply the whole world at the
present rate of consumption for over one hundred
jcars.
There is another aspect of the matter, though,
which is not so favorable to ourselves. The lack of
coal has set the Germans to developing electrical
energy by water power and transmitting it to manu
facturing centers. By devoting energy and money to
such enterprises under the stimulus of necessity and
the certainty of great rewards for. success, it is likely
the Germans will be carrying on 'most of their indus
try by cheap electrical power while we are still relying
upon steam because coal is cheap. .Thus what ap
pears to be.a disadvantage to the Germans may be
turned to advantage by science.
It has been stated that while each horsepower of.
mechanical' energy developed in the United States by
steam costs an average of $20 per annum, the Niagara
Falls Power Company furnishes an electrical current
equivalent to. one horsepower day and night for less
than $10 a year. An immense saving is therefore
possible by the development of electric power from
waterfalls. The present hard times in Germany may
thus be for them the beginning of a: "new! 1 industrial
era. and. perhaps we shall ourselves have to turn to the
same source of power in the end, instead of relying
upon bur. abundant and cheap coal for industrial su
premacy.. .... .'.-.. .

THE LEAGUE CONVENTION.
BULLETIN No. 3, issued from the headquarters
of the California League of Republican clubs,
announces that the committee on transporta
tion has arranged for reduced fares by rail or water
lo Los Angeles during the week of the convention of
the league.
In setting forth the terms under which the reduced
rates can be obtained, the bulletin says:
"From all points north of Mo j aye or Ellwood, on
the Southern Pacific Railroad, tickets will be sold on
the 'certificate plan.' That is, the attendant will buy
a first-class ticket to Los Angeles, and will take a
receipt from the railroad agent for such ticket on a
form which will be provided. This certificate will
state the course to be pursued in obtaining the one
third rate for the return trip from Los Angeles. It :s
essential that the attendant should have this certificate,
which may cover more than one ticket, provided the
additional tickets are for the attendant's family. The
tickets for the going trip may be bought at any time
within fifteen (15) days before,' or during, the meet
ing. The certificate (upon which the qjie-third fare
return-trip ticket will be issued) must be counter
signed by the secretary of the convention /and pre
sented to the agent of the railroad company at Los
Angeles with forty-eight hours of the close of the
convention, who will thereupon sell a return ticket to
the starting point at one-third first-class rates, which
ticket will be limited to three days from date of sale.
The blank certificates required can be obtained from
Major M. T. Owens, chairman of Local Executive
Committee. 130 South Spring street. Los Angeles,
Cal., or from the secretary of your club."
It is further announced that an open rate of one
and one-third first-class fare for the round trip from
all stations in Southern California to Los Angeles
and return, on either the Southern Pacific or the
Southern California railroads, has been Riven; and
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company makes a special
rate of one and one-half fare for the round trip from
all ports of call for its steamers in California to Los
Angeles sea ports â Port Los Angeles, Redondo and
San Pedro. v
By reason of these arrangements the attendance
on the convention should be considerably increased.
The gathering is to be one of great importance to the
party and it is desirable that every section of the State
be represented. The committee on transportation de
serves credit, therefore, for obtaining such a reduction
in fares as will conduce to that end.

Pied down In the ditches.
Wild, howling for bread.
For the moment the people forgot their
misery, and the London Times had it that
when the royal cortege was passing
through the streets of Dublin one enthu
siastic woman cried out to her Majesty,
as she sat in her open carriage with her
children: "Och, Queen, dear, make one
of them Prince Patrick and all Ireland
will die for you."
The Queen did not forget, for she soon
after had her third son. the Duke of Con
naught, christened Patrick, and she also
created a new title for the Prince of
Walesâ that of Earl of Dublin. She tells
us in her book, "Leaves Froin,My Diary."
that when she was leaving Kingstown
harbor she climbed to the top of one of
the paddle-boxes of her yacht and, stand
ing by the side of the Prince Consort,
bowed and waved her handkerchief re
peatedly to the cheering multitude.
Some, twenty years before the Queen's
uncle, George I\ , when leaving the same
place, is said to have shed tears of regret
at breaking away from his Iwyal and lov
ing subjects. "VV hat a contrast betweeen
the characters of these two sovereigns of
the House of Brunswick.
Thackeray, in his "Four Georges," says
of him: "We cannot get at his character.
Will men of the future have nothing bet
ter to do than to. unswatho and interpret
the royal old mummy?" Tom Moore ha.s
his fling at him when at breakfast table
with
"Tea and toast.
Death warrants and the Morning Post."
Charles Dickens sets forth his meanness,
selfishness and pomposity in the character
of Mr. Turveydrop. Irishmen look back
with pain on the scenes of loyal servility
enacted at that time in the Irish capital
by leading Irishmen. They resolved "not
to obtrude their grievances upon his Maj
esty during his stay in Dublin." The
great Liberator. Daniel O'Connell, pre
sented him with a huge bunch of sham
rock?. All this was done with the idea of
conciliating the King so that afterward he
would be disposed to favor measures in
tended to advance the Interests, of Ire
lfind. In these views they failed utterly.
What could they expect from one whom
Thackeray describes as "heartless and
treacherous." In Mitchell's History of
Ireland we are told how King George IV
"was hailed with tumultuous hurrahs in
the city of Dublin wherever he passed,
and in return he directed his secretary to
write a letter recommending the people to
be united." Lord Byron, in his poem
called the "Avatar," lashes the toadies
and sycophants who fawned upon this
"simulacrum of a King."
Aye. shout In his train, let thine orators lash
Their fanciful spirits to pamper his pride;
Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash
His soul o"er the freedom Implored and de
nied.

Queen Victoria paid a second visit to
Ireland in August, 1853. just four years
after her first. This time she came direct
to Dublin to see the Industrial Exhibition,
which owed its existence to the liberality
of a single Irishman â William Dargan â
who refused a baronetcy at the hands of
the Queen. Again the people
Cllrnbed up to walls and battlements.
To towers and window*, yea to chlmneytops.
So see great Queen Victoria pass through
the streets of Dublin. Again they shouted
themselves hoarse with cries of "Long
live the Queen." All this ebullition of loy
alty took place while the heavens were
drenching soldiers and "peelers" and rab
ble. The royal party were amply pro
tected in closed carriages, through the
windows of which they enjoyed the fun.
Some of the royal juveniles described it
afterward.
The third visit of Queen Victoria to
Ireland was made in IM>l. and again In
the month of August. This visit lasted
eight days. Accompanied as on the two
former occasions by Prince Albert and
some of the royal children, she again vis
ited Dublin direct ' from England, and
after a short stay proceeded by rail
through the central parts of the country
until Bhe reached the far-famed Lakes of
Killarney.
There she was entertained by Lord
Castlerosse and Herbert of Muckross.
Fortunately, the weather was all that
could be desired and the Queen was
ecstatic over the beauties of the scenery.
It was believed at the time that she would
establish a summer residence there,
either for herself or for one of the royal
Princes. Forty years have passed since
then and neither the Queen nor any of
her offspring has a lodge or any kind
of dwelling in the Emerald Isle. Oh. no;
the Queens heart is in the Highlands
wherever she goes. The "land of brown
heath and shaggy wood" is the land for
aer. Queen Victoria's love for Scotland
may be attributed to the fact that she
came near being born in Scotland. Her
father, the Duke of Kent, had intended.
a short time before her birth, to take up
his domicile In Lanarkshire, a county in
Scotland, but the fates declared other
wise. Queen Victoria once said to Sir
Archibald Alison, "I am more proud of
my Scotch descent than of any other.
W"hen I nrst came into Scotland I felt as
if I, were coming home." Balmoral Pal
ace, In Scotland, is her favorite abode.
She is ever Impatient to go there and
loath to leave It and she far prefers it
to majestic and historic Windsor. Scotch
servants are her favorites. The Scotch
gillie. John Brown, was her faithful servi
tor â ever ready at her beck and call â for
thirty-four years. At his death her
grief was co profound as to astonish the
nations. Honors and rewards are lavished
upon the soldiers who wear the tartan
and the kilt.
Per contra. Ireland has always been
treated to the "cold shoulder." "the Icy
hand," by not only her Majesty Queen
Victoria, but by all the Majesties who pre
ceded her. She has been treated as the
Cinderella in the happy or unhappy fam-

ily which constitute thf> British Isles*. It
has often been said. "If the Queen had
built years ago a palace In Ireland at
Killarney or in lovely Wicklow or in some
other picturesque spot in the green isle,
things might have been different. Who
can tell?"
Of all cad words of tonpue or pen.
The saddest are "It micht have been."
We do know, however, with aad cer
tainty, on the authority of the eminent
statistician Mulhall, that the present
reign has been the most disastrous to
Ireland since the days of Queen Eliza
beth.
The number of deaths from famine dur
ing Queen Victoria's reign is 1.223.000;
number of emigrants, 4.150.wÂ»; number of
persons evicted from their homes, 3.668,
000. The population of Ireland has de
creased nearly 50 per cent, while the pop
ulation of England has Increased at the

sion or coercion, when recommended by
her Ministers, as often they did. it he**
not been heard outside of the councÂ»l
chamber.
In writing about her first rislt to Ire
land her Majesty paid a high compliment
to the beauty of Irish women. "The beauty
of the women la remarkable â such beauti
ful dark eyes and hair and such fine teeth.
Almost every third woman was pretty and
some remarkably so."
During Queen Victoria's long reign of
sixty-three yearsâ lS37 to .1900â ehe has
spent less than one month in Ireland, al
though the distance la only a trifle be
tween Holyhead and Kingstown. Natur
ally, the Irish people feel resentful at this.
Nevertheless she Â¦will receive a cordial
reception. Irishmen know how to differ
entiate the sovereign and the woman. In
the beginning of her reign Daniel O'Con
nell declared that if it were necessary he
could get "500,000 brave Irishmen to de
fend the life, the honor and the person of
the beloved young lady by whom Eng
land's throne is now filled." Some Irish
Nationalists declare that the Queen's visit
is intended as a bribe to Ireland to aban
don the national for the Imperialistic
idea. Others declare that she comes with
a shamrock in her bonnet to do the work
of the recruiting sergeant and Induce stal
wart young Irishmen to till up the de
pleted ranks of her Irish regiments.
Many give her the credit of coming with
the view of conciliating Irish opinion so
that there would be brought about a un
ion of hearts as well as of hands between
Irishmen and Englishmen. Although past
four score, still "while the lamp holds out
to burn," etc.. and so the Queen's diagno
sis of Ireland's ills may bring about a.
change of prescription that "blesseth her
who gives and her who takes."
NO EXPANSION ISSUE.
\A R. HOWELL of the Atlanta Constitution, in
/ \ a long article in Harpers Weekly, states as
by authority the Democratic position on ex
pansion. He first sets up the Republican position,
and calls it imperialism, and proceeds to antagonize
it with a simon-pure article of Democratic expansion.
He favors admitting Cuba and Porto Rico as States,
regardless of our pledge as to independence of the
former, and declares that he thinks his party will
favor the complete conquest and subjugation of the
Philippines, with the intention of conferring upon
them a government and administering the same, until
the people are ready to administer it themselves, when
they are to become independent. Mr. Howell declares
that the anti-expansionists, like Atkinson and Senator
Hoar, are the cause of the Filipino war, and girds at
them as savagely as any Republican. He also becomes
deeply and benevolently religious in the matter, and
says that our tropical possessions have fallen to us
providentially and that he personally believes in
always holding the Philippines as a divinely ap
pointed duty.
The most careful reading of his paper fails -to dis
close any material difference between his statement of
the Republican position on this issue and his
declaration of what the Democratic position will be.
If any appear, it is in favor of the Republican posi
tion, for we cannot believe that the American people
will ever consent to admit these tropical islands as
States, and their mixed races as citizens.
It is true that there is a glimmer in Mr. Hcrtvell's
article of that false light which has deceived so many
into the belief that our race is to colonize and populate
these islands. He talks of markets and American push
as glibly as John Barrett and Senator Morgan. The
fact is that without some form of servile labor the
tropics will add no surplus to the markets, and that
American push evaporates and disappears under the
vertical sun.
Mr. Bryan's platform on this subject is already writ
ten and published. Its expression lends itself readily
to the ideas of Mr. Howell, and it is now plain that a
reaction on the expansion issue will have no more
chance for expression at the ballot-box this year than
it had in California in 1898, when the parties stood
about neck and neck on that subject.
It is daily becoming plainer that the commercial
ambition of the Democratic South backs expansion
more strongly than Northern sentiment. Two cents
a pound advance on raw cotton will carry the South
over to any proposition looking to expansion. It
was cotton that held the South to slavery. That sec
tion put cotton above the Union, and now for the
sake of cotton it is willing, according to Mr. Howell.
to take into citizenship the unpedigrccd millions of the
tropics.
No matter what Mr. Bryan's platform may say on
the subject, if his party get power it will be run by
the section that furnishes its majority, and that means
that it will be run as an expansion party, with state
hood and citizenship attachments.
The general issue of expansion is therefore practi
cally eliminated from this year's campaign. With
Bryan's party girding at Atkinson and Carl Schurz for
bringing on the Filipino war, and demanding that we
take Cuba, and admit all this black-and-tan population
to citizenship, the opponents of expansion and of
even- policy that grows out of it can have no choice
of parties and will simply wait for that stormy and
upheaving reaction which will come later.

Mayor I^elan's dispatch, falsely declaring that the

understood outside that a few kindergarten politicians
were permitted to trifle with the sanitary reputation of
this city to the damage of its commerce. There are
places in the world where the health authorities have
not only professional and technical skill, but also a
proper and sober sense of their responsibility. The
people who, are served by such a Board of Health nat
urally come to think that all others arc protected by
e*jual skill and sense of responsibility.
As far as this city is concerned, this is a mistake.

Something should be done by the citizens to relieve
the city of the unbearable position created by our

San Francisco and the State. To stop the spreading
belief that we are in the panic and distress of a pesti

HE present visit of Queen Victoria
sto Ireland is- the fourth since her
accession to the throne in l&fr. She
was 42 years old at the time of her
last visit, now she is almost 81. It
Is officially announced that her visit
this time is in recoenltlon of the
skill and valor of her officers and soldiers
in the present Boer campaign. General
Robert**â "Fighting Bobs"â now in chief
command, is an Irisnman and- takes his
title of Lord Waterford from his birth
place. Generals Kitchener' French, Kelly-
Kenny and White are all Irishmen and
her Majesty wants to pluck a shamrock
from the soil that gave them birth. The
heroism displayed by the Connaught
Rangers, the Inneskilling Dragoons, the
Dublin and the Irish. Fusiliers at the
crossing of the Tugela and Modder Riv
ers and storming of Kimberley and Bloem
fontein touched, the heart of the Queen
as no other event since the charge of the
Light Brigade at Balaklava in the Cri
mean war. Instead of "hanging men and
women for the wearing of the green" the
Queen directed that her brave Irish sol
diers should be privileged to wear the
shamrock on St. Patrick's day. For the
first time in history the Irish flag waved
over the Mansion House in London. The
nobility and officials of the crown, fol
lowing the example of her Majesty, out
hibernlcised the Hibernians in celebrating
Ireland's national festival.
In recent cablegrams we are told that
"the Queen has ordertd a court garden
party to be held in Dublin In the second
week in April when she will be present.
The Mistress of the Kobes has ordered
for her Majesty a unique gown of Mer
onac velvet with designs in shamrocks
and a sunshade of Irish silk, ornamented
with sreen silk shamrocks, with five of
the four-leafed variety at the top." If
the weather should turn out as unpropl
tlous as in the years 1553 and IS6I when the
Queen was in Dublin she will need an
umbrella rather than a sunshade whose
shamrocks would be likely to run Into six
or seven leafed variety through the action
of drenchtng rain. During her previous
visits to Ireland Queen Victoria was ac
companied by her devoted and dearly be
loved husband, the Prince Cousort. Now
she goes as a widowed sovereign, and
many .1 spot she is likely to revisit will
remind her of the deceased Prince. Her
llrst visit to Ireland was In August. IS4D,
when, with Prince Albert and her four
children, on her royal yacht the Victoria
and Albert, she lirst landed at the cove
of Cork. In honor of this event the name
of cove was changed by her Majesty's
command Into Queenstown just as Dun
leavy was transformed into Kingstown
when George IV visited Dublin. The royal
yacht steamed up the beautiful River Lee
to the city of Cork amid the plaudits of
countless thousands. The Queen was
overwhelmed with the enthusiastic recep
tion she met with in a part of Ireland
which she was told teemed with disloy
alty.
lvfore the Queen left England, the
London Times. Punch and other great
journals predicted direful disaster to the
royal party at the hands of disaffected
Irishmen. According to them, the royal
visitors would surely be mobbed and
would be lucky if they escaped with their
lives. The Queen, with the proverbial
pluck of the Brunswick family, proceeded
on her journey despite the awful predic
tions of alarmists. The same newspapers
and the same type of bell wethers are
shouting danger ahead to-day. Scotland
Yard, we are told, is in a terrible state
of alarm and commotion. Between 'JOOO
and 10.000 policemen, including 1500 plain
clothes detectives, will watch out for the
safety of her Majesty in Dublin. Already
several regiments of cavalry and infantry
have been forwarded to strike terror Into
the hearts of the Fenians who may be
lurking in the neighlwrhood. All the
Queen's officers and all the Queen's men,
especially those of Scotland Yard, â¢will
pa.^s sleepless nights until she is safely
back on English. soil. It was not on Irish
soil that Queen Victoria heretofore in
curred any danger or suffered any insult;
It was in hÂ«>r own capitalâ Londonâ and
not far from her own palace. Edward
Oxford, a potboy of 17. in IS4O fired two
shots at her as she was driving up Con
stitution Hill with Prince Albert. Two
years after a man named John Francis
attempted her life in the same manner
and in the same place. A hunchback
named Bean pointed a pistol at Queen
Victoria as she was leaving Buckingham
Palace, but it was knocked from his nand
before he could pull the trigger. A third
attempt upon her life was made on Con
stitution Hill in IS4'.Â» and in ISSO. Robert
Pate, an ex-lieutenant of hussars, in ISSO
struck her on the face with a walking
stick near the residence of the Duke of
Cambridge. This does not complete the
list, but it is sufHclent to show that it is
in London and not in Dublin that Queen
Victoria requires protection.
Of course, the Queen, in ISGI as in 1900.
would not undertake such a journey with
out due precaution for her personal
safety. Her Ministers saw to it that the
coast was clear and her military escort
suttlclently strong-. Lord Clarendon, then
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, wrote to Lord
John Uussell, Premier of Kngland that
"Agitation in Ireland Is extinct; repeal is
forgotten; seditious associations are clos
ed up; the priests are frightened and the
people are tranquil. Everything tends,"
said he. "to secure for the Queen an en
thusiastic reception and the one draw
back, which is the general distress of all
classes, has Its advantages, for it will
enable the Queen to do what is kind and
considerate to those who are suffering."
This last sentence is a lurid commentary
on England's methods In dealing with
Ireland. It is on the principle of "Do evil
that good may come from it." Knock a
fellow down that you may show how good
you are by extending a hand to help him
up. Queen Victoria soon discovered that
no matter how disaffected the majority of
Irishmen were tney do not assault nor
insult women. A poet of the time well
expressed the feelings of the Queen:
A thousand anxious cares I had,
A thousand doubts and fears-
Would Ireland meet me wildly slad
Or darkly drowned In tears?
Both fears alike I now reject;
One day has testified
Enouch to Irish self-respect
And Irish manly pride.
In Cork. "Waterford. Dublin and Belfast,
which she visited on this trip, sailing from
place to place on her royal yacht, she was
greeted with marked enthusiasm.
When the royal party sailed Into Water
ford harbor they saw near the entrance
Duncannon Fort, historic as the last stop
ping place In Ireland of unfortunate Klngr
James 11, the last of the Stuarts'. After
his defeat by William, Prince of Orange,
at the battle of the Boyne he abandoned
his brave Irish soldiers and took to his
heels. This was the King who early in
the light, when he saw the Irish soldiers
prevailing against the red coats, cried out,
"Oh, spare my English subjects!" It is
said that the Irish officers were so dis
gusted at his poltroonery that they ex
pressed a desire to exchange commanders
and fight the battle over again. King
James fled to France with the maledic
tions of the Irish upon his miserable head.
If disaffection lurked in Dublin it did
not show Its head during the four days'
celebration over the royal visit. On his
return' to Windsor Castle Prince Albert
wrote to his friend and mentor. Baron
Stockmar: "Our Irish tour has gone off
well beyond all expectations. Of the en
thusiasm that greeted us from all quar
ters you can form no conception." In this

It will be perceived from the specimens of the
whole lot of amendments offered that if all our re
formers had their way we should soon have something
like a new constitution. We may therefore be satisfied
in the knowledge that it is not so easy to amend it as
to propose an amendment. It is better that some
needed reforms should wait than that our whole well
ordered system should be thrown into confusion by
constitution tinkering at every session of Congress.

(Concluded.)
.
Marconi's System.
In this system as used for directed sig
nals there is no vertical wire, and the
transmitting ppark gap and the coherer |
are each placed in the focus of a parabolic !
mirror. The coherer Is here the receiver I
of the wave as well as the detector, and j
its position Is important. (In this case
the transmitter and the receiver must be
tuned to the synchronism by strips of
copper of carefully adjusted length.) As
usually practiced, however, for undirect
ed signals, a vertical wire is used at each
end, and the exact position of the trans
mitting spark gap or of the coherer be
comes a matter of no great importance.
In this case the oscillator and its spark
gap serve only to charge the vertical line
to the necessary potential. Trains of
waves are shut out from this vertical Una
throughout its length, although they are
probably stronger near the earth. A plate'
or ball at the top of the wire is therefore
a help in most cases, as It makes the
waves more uniform. The waves are
radiated In all directions horizontally, but
the vertical radiation is probably weak.
The portion of the ether waves striking
the vertical wire at the receiving end is
absorbed by the wire, and if the potential
Is high enough a discharge passes, caus
ing the coherer to act. The potential of
this current Is high because of the enor
mously high rate of cutting, the waves
passing with the speed of light. The co
nerer is here not the receiver but only a
detector of the charge upon the vertical
wire, and its position in the circuit does
not matter. The nrst parr of the. oscil
lating discharge, because of its high
amplitude, is much the most effective,
and the tuning of the receiving circuit to
any particular frequency iÂ» therefore
neither necessary nor useful.
Functions of the Apparatus.
In the diagram of the receiving circuits
there is shown a coil on each side of the
coherer in the local circuit. These coils
are Inductive resistances, or "chokin?
coils" in which -the rapidly oscillating
current flows with great difficulty. They
serve to- prevent the waste of the enei^y
of the ether waves which would occur if
the discharge could pass freely In this cir
cuit, and they compel the discharge to
pass wholly through the coherer.
The action of the relay, the tapper and
the recorder are probably sufficiently well
understood from what has gone before.
In each instrument the break is shunted
by a non-Inductive high resistance. A
high resistance incandescent lamp would

MINISTERS ARE
CRITICIZED BY
CHURCH ELDER
Claim Made That Some Have
Been Inmates of San
Quentin.
Rev. John Ellis Assails the Position
Occupied by the Rev. B. Fay
Mills and Says Other
Sharp Things.
"Soms of the ministers, including
Presbyterian preachers, who have oc
cupied pulpits in San Francisco are a
disgrace to the civilization of the
nineteenth century. A few of them
have had free board in the State
Prison and others ought to be sent
there for a term of years."
The foregoing sensational views were
expressed by Elder A. T. Robinson at the
weekly meeting of the Presbyterian min
isters yesterday. The statement was made
during a discussion of a paper read by
Key. John Ellis on the "Passing of the
Old Ways," which was also sensational.
A number of the leading Presbyterian
ministers of this city and vicinity con
curred in what both gentlemen said and
added their opinions on the subject. Rev.
B. Fay Mills came in for his share of
criticism, and other matters pertaining
to the church were touched on without
gloves. In his paper Rev. John Ellis said
in part:
The only commendable feature of the system
of Christianity U that of lib adaptability to ail
ages, climes and people. The closing Uei-ade of
tne nineteenth century has been fruitful of a
decided evidence of the passing of the old' way
and the coming it! of other ways. Fast day=
and feasts will not be sufiicient'to call a hail.
Ten years ago I sat at the eHe of a man In
the street cars on Market street who was on
his way to the largest hall In this city. Thou
sand* were there waiting to hear him, composed
of the poor, sick and soul hungry, who hung
upon his words as upon the worus of the oracle
of Clod. Two months eince I both saw and
heard him in his own pulpit, where he ad
dressed the select class of society people. On
his way to the Pavilion he clasped a Bible In his
hand, which he then said contained the very
word ot God. In his own pulpit there was not
a Bible visible. The lesson : for the morning
was read from Milton. No text, not a quota
tion from the sacred law, prophets, gospel, let
ters or revelation, but reference to the occult
science. - No benediction, but a profuse praise
of the Hindoo monk, whom he recommended to
the people as a suitable teacher with whom
they should sit and receive instruction In re
ligious thought.
Within the rast ten years B. Fay Mills, who
was one of us, saw the passing of the old
ways, and he knew that Othello"s vocation was
gone, and so he went. Dwight L. Moody of
sacred memory preceded and succeeded Evan
gelist Mills. He, too, saw the passing of the
ways, but Othello's vocation did not concern
him.
Where are the people who once crowded our
largest halls and listened to the appeals of
danger and the remedy for sin. who were
moved by tears, and when opportunity afforded
stood up for prayers, raised hands, signed cards
and Joined churches? Are they no more? Yes;
they still live and multiply. They are march
ing to bands of music, singing and praying on
the streets and on the public squares; are wor
shiping In side street store rooms, in tents and
are increasing their ranks by thousands.
Talk with these people who have ceased to
enter the upholstered pew. They will tell you
that they could not go there to worship; they
will tell you that after they gave their last
nickel that sometimes they did ro and ilid not
have a penny to give, they felt they could not
listen to urgent appeals and not respond. They
eald ther were outdressed. outclassed, out
pewed and consequently outcast. In times ol
church quietness we were but fillings and stuff-
Ings, and In times of activity we were, hewers
of wood and drawers of water, and In the battle
we were on the firing line, while the favorite
class wore the chevron of the orderly and the
epaulet of the general. So we took to the
streets, halls and tents.
Tbe growth of the church along secular lines
has been at the expense of the spiritual. Thera
is no logic by which you can harmonize tht
$5000 Increase of the pulpit and the average {600
Increase of the pew.
Rev. F. Doane, Rev. H. N. Bovler, Rev.
Dr. Mathena. Rev. Dr. Clark and Rev. H.
H. Bell spoke to the subject, but their
views were mild compared with those of
Elder Robinson. He. said It was very
much more agreeable to be an optimist
than a pessimist. He also said there was
a degeneracy In the pulpit, and It was evi
denced in the subjects selected for Sun
day sermons. He proved his assertion by
reading The Call's weekly church .index.
He quoted from the list "The Cleaning
of Sewers." which he said was a very
commendable topic, but unsulted for a
sermon. He concluded his remarks by
delivering his charge against the cloth
which created a sensation.
Note â These lessons have been prepared for
The Call's Home Study Circle by Professor
Benno Kirschbaum of Philadelphia. They are
Intended primarily for Americans who purpose
attending the Paris exposition. The lessons
will Include (1) common French word 3 and
phrases, (2) easy conversation and (3) simple
reading lessons.
LESSON NO. 7â SEPTIEME LECON.
A Few Useful Hints.
1. To form the plural of French nouns
we have to add an "s" to the singular, as
le llvre, the book; luh leevr. Les Hvres;
lay lee-vr.
2. But if a noun ends in "s," "x," "z." It
does not change, in the plural. The
plural then Is the same as the singular, as:
le bras, the arm; brah; les bras.
Note â There are many more exceptions to the
above rules, of which we ?hall, however, give
the most important ones oniyâ namely:
3. If a noun ends in "au" or "eu," such
nouns tak>? "x" in the plural, as le cha
peau: the hat; shap-oh. Leschapeaux;
lay shap-oh. Le neveu: the nephew; luh
nuh-vuh. Les neveux; lay nuh-vuh.
4. Also, if a noun ends in "al." this ter
mination changes in the plural to "aux,"
as: le cheval; the horse; shuh-vahl.
Les chevaux; shuh-vdh.
Note â The articles for both the masculine and
femrhine genders are "les" In the plural, with
out any exception.
Memory Exercises.
Much Needed Words and Phrases.
1. This gentleman; cc monsieur; sub,
2. This man; cet homme; sett-torn.
3. This friend; cet ami: sett-tamee.
4. This lady; cette dame; eett-dahm.
Xoteâ The student -will see here that "this" Is
translated In three different ways â cc, cet, cette
âaccording to the following simple rule*,
which he ought to bear In mind, especially In
forming sentences In writing and when carry-
Ing on com ersatlon.
cc Is used before any masculine noun
beginning with a consonant, as: cc train;
this train. â¢
cet is used If a noun commences with a
vowel, or h mute, as: cet hotel: this hotel,
cet etage; this floor; sett-tay-tazj.
cette Is used always before feminine
nouns, as cette rue; this street: and ces
before all plural nouns, aa ces pares; these
parks; ces^avenues; these avenues.

13. It has rained all day.
11 a plu toute la journee.
The climate; le elimat; klee-mah.
Xoteâ ln French such terms as given above
are expressed in a very peculiar way. We may
term it strictly 'â¢Idiomatic": a literal transla
tion into Englith would rrake no sense, since It
would Kounii: it makes warm, it makes coM.
etc. The verb "to make" Is employed Instead
of "to be" in sneaking of the weather. The
student must, therefore, try to remember that
the Frenchmen says: It makes warm, tt makes
snow, etc.. as:
Is it not foggy this morning?
Ne fait â -il pas un brouillard cc
matin?
14. How Is your wife?

son he must always observe the polite form anj
speak Â£S shown above: How Is Mrs. your

STEAMER CLEVELAND RETURNING FROM HER LAST TRIP TO THE PHILIPPINES,
Private advices received by the China yesterday makes the position of the disabled steamer Cleveland much more se
cure than it appeared on first blush. The stout old vessel has been in many a tight place, but in every instance has
come out of scrapes which would have sent half the vessels sailing In and out of San Francisco to the bottom. The hull
of the Cleveland Is as good to-day almost as when she was launched, and that Is saying a great deal when the splendid
material put Into the hull Is considered.
Captain Klltgaard of the disabled steamer writes that she was to the northeast of Maul and not to the northwest,
as stated. The thrust shaft is cracked and there Is nothing the matter with the main shaft, which was said to be
broken. The steamer Claudlne has gone out to tow the Cleveland Into Honolulu, and It Is expected that repairs will be
made there and the vessel and her cargo will get here In due time. ,
Several captains who have commanded the Cleveland were talking about her yesterday, and they one and all pro
nounced her a serviceable and seaworthy ship and anything but a "hoodoo."

RECENT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES.
anode thl3 purpose. These shunts were
found to be necessary to prevent spark
ing 1 and consequent disturbance of the
coherer. The tapper and the recorder
produce disturbances unless shunted,
and prevent the coherer from returning
to Its sensitive condition, and thus reduce
the distance at which signals can be re
relvpri.
Performances of the Marconi System.
Communication has now been steadily
maintained for two years over a distance
of about eighteen miles, and Marconi
states that In his opinion "there is no kind
of matter which can stop or seriously In
terfere with the working of such an in
stallation." Messages were first sent
across the English Channel about a year
ago. a distance of thirty-two miles, and
It is stated that the signals have been de
tected at ninety miles. The system has
now been adopted by two lines of channel
steamers.
The performance at our yacht race last
October was not up to this standard, al
though it was successful for the purpose.
Tests were afterward made on vessels of
our navy. The trial board reported that
the system was well adapted for use in
squadron signaling, and the signals were
unimpaired by rain, wind, fog and motion
of the ships. The distance attained was
sixteen to twenty-two miles. Between
large ships, with masts of 140 feet, and
torpedo boats, with masts of 43 feet, the
signals can be read on the ships at eighty
five miles and on the torpedo boats at
seven miles.
The system \a adapted for use on all
vessels of the navy, including- torpedo
boat 9 and dispatch boats, patrols and
scouts, but is not practicable In a small
boat. It was recommended that the sys
tem be given a trial in the navy. It Is to
be tried, also, as a method of signaling
between lightships and the shore, which
has been successfully practiced in Eng
land for more than a year.
Suggestions as to Future Develop
ment.
Professor Elihu Thomson has suggest
ed that if two vertical wires were placed
at a distance apart equal to half a wave
length, without earth connection, they
would enhance rach other's effect. Thla
arrangement would give, also, a partial
control of direction, as the disturbance
would travel principally In a line perpen
dicular to the plane passing thro,ugh the
two wires. Such a transmitter would bÂ«
tuned to a definite frequency and the sig
nals would therefore be selective. Tha
wave length used should not be too short.
Floaenden is reported to have developed
a receiver which Is 2009 times as sensitive
as the coherer now in use. By means of
this detector, according to a newspaper
Interview, he hopes to send messages
across the Atlantic.

Two British ships made port yesterday
and both had more or less heavy weather
during the voyage. The Oranasia from
Hamburg was twice aground in the river
Elbe Etnd after rounding the Horn sprang
a leak and the crew was compelled to man
the pumps every day. The Indore had
heavy weather from the start and a
gale off the Horn carried away her bow
sprit and a number of sails. One of
her crew fell from aloft early in March
and received injuries from which he died
when the ship was in sight of land.
The Oranasia made the run from the
English coast In 136 days, while the Indore
was .15S days coming from Liverpool.
Leaving Hamburg on November 7 behind
a tug the Oranasia went ashore in the
river the same day. She was got oft on
the next tide but again grounded on a
bank twelve hours later. Over 300 tons of
the cargo had to be discharged into light
ers, and on November 9 the ship reached
Siade, where the remainder of her cargo
was put aboard. On November 16 the tug
left the ship off Beachy Head and then all
wont well until December 1, when a heavy
gale from the southwest was run into.
There was no apparent damage and the
Fhlp was twenty-tour days making the run
from 50 degrees in the Atlantic to 5") de
grees in the Pacino. On February 2 the
Oranasia s-prang a leak and ever since she
has been making two inches of water a
day. The chances are that the bumping
Fhe got In the river Elbe started a rivet
and the heavy weather off the Horn made
matters worse and started the leak.
The Oranasia brings over 40000 tons of a
general cargo. A considerable portion of
it is cement and the remainder is mer
chandise that would not spoil in the
water. Had the agents, of the vessel
known that she would make the voyage
in 13G days from Beachy Head they could
have turned a pretty penny on the cargo
of cement. The Harbor Commissioners
asked for bids for cement to build the new
cylinder pier at Howard-street wharf No.
3* and the agents made a very low offer
stipulating that they deliver the cement
as soon as the ship arrived. The Commis
sioners wanted the cement within a few
weeks and dare not take any chances on
the probable arrival of a sailing vessel.
In consequence the next lowest bidder got
the contract. As matters have turned out,
however, the Oranasla's cement would
have been in time for the job.
The Indore left Liverpool 15S days ago.
On January 20 she ran into a heavy west
erly gale that carried away the bowsprit.
The decks were full of water nearly all
the time and the cabin, galley and fore
castle were gutted. The ship labored
heavily and quite a number of sails were
blown away. She had another succession
of gales for fifteen days off the Horn, and
the crew was almost completely worn out
making and taking in sail. On March 19
when the worst of the voyage was over
John Beaumont fell from the footrope of
the main topgallant staysail to the deck.
The unfortunate fellow was terribly in
jured but managed to hold on to life un
til March 30. A few hours after the Far
allones had been sighted he breathed his
last and was buried at sea. He was a na
tive of England. 49 years of age.
Arthur Griffin. Charles Thome and
"Scotty" Campbell, seal hungers from the
schooner Geneva were brought into port
on the steamer Noyo yesterday. They left
the sealer on March 30 when she was
about forty miles from Greenwood in the
search of seals and got lost in the fog. On
April 1 at 5:15 p. mi the Noyo picked them
up when four miles from the beach, and
brought them on to San Francisco. The
men had not suffered much as they had
provisions and water In the boat.
The carpenters' strike has extended to
the water front, and yesterday the men
engaged on the new Postofflce building
walked out. The men employed by the
State on the front get $3 60 a day and the
outsiders who work for contractors who
have State work to do think they should
get the same pay. The chances are that
the contractors and the men will settle
the matter to-day.

Important for the Student.
Before maKing any attempt to read tha
text of the new French lesson the student
should, if possible, hear it several timts
from the mouth of one who has a better
knowledge of the language than himself.
It is also important to try to familiarize
one's self thoroughly with the meaning
and spelling of eacn word. To promote tha
latter in particular it will be well to tran
scribe as often as possible from dictation
and from* memory some of the important
sentences; then compare them with the
originals and note the mistakes.

TO SAIL.
CHICAGO, April 2.â The market for corn be
gan the session with a spurt of activity and
j strength which lasted throughout the day. Re
i duction in Liverpool stocks was about the only
Item In the statistical array which excited con
sideration. Shipping sales were put at "iO.OOO
bushels, all but 100,000 bushels of which was
sold for direct export. The visible supply ln
1 creased 447,000 bushels, but that makes only
I 21,(52.000 bushels In comparison with 32,737,000
bushels a year ago. Way closed *^o over Satur
day.
Wheat should have declined, according to the
views of the experts on 'Change, but It did not.
The. demand for export kept modestly In the
background and both visible and the amount on
passage increased. Liverpool .was merely
I steady and domestic reports were favorable to
the well being of the crop. On the other hand
the bulls expected reports of cold weather in
various: parts of Europe, the reduction of ship
ments from Russia last week, the stories of In-
I Juries to wheat in sack In Argentina by the
heavy rains, and the official India crop report
showing the new percentages for the different
Important grain provinces. The strength of
corn naturally reinforced the bull position and
the market went up. There was a good com
mission house demand, without apparent reason
I and shorts were made uncomfortable by the
I course of the market. The seaboard was rela
tively strong, the northwest relatively weak.
New York reported the day's export business
at ten loads. May opened UÂ©?4c up at 67Â«j$-i4c
and advanced to fi7?RC. From that point the
bears forced the price down to 66 7 Â»c. The India
crop report fame toward the end and was In
fluential in the reaction which had already bÂ»
gun. a"hd May rallied to 67*Â»(g87Hc, reacted to
b7>ic on profit taking, closing %&Hc higher -at
67 l iftC7'.;e.
Oats were firm, helped by corn. Country of
ferings were small. Spring work is Impending,
but country roads are reported In bad condition
May closed ! Â»fi\Â«c over Saturday.
The provisions market was strong and active
in s-pite of liberal profit taking. The strength of
corn, buying of hogs, as well as product by an
influential packer, and also buying by sold-out
bulls, were influences to which the strength
Â¦was attributed. One firm took 15,000 tlerceÂ« of
lard at practically one price. The cash demand
was good. May pork closed Joe over Saturday
May lard improved and May ribs s(g7Hc up. '

TRAINING A CHILD'S WILL.
"Little good can come of belnjr arbi
trary with a child by making him do as
we Tvish without flrst getting at the causes
of his willfulness." says the Woman's
Home Companion. "A child's volitions nriÂ»
transient. The endeavor, then, must be to
get at his fleeiinir volitions and train #ach
one arisht. until he can be said to have
;l KOverrJniE: purpose. Some put Implicit
I faith in reasonlns with a child. Well it
i shows respect for child nature, and oec:Â»
slonally # reaches him: at l^ast. It rpav
have some effect In developing ha
reasoning powers, and certainly promises
confidence between parent and child If
his reason were already developed there
would be less difficulty In training the
will, but since Jt is not we must train
the will through other avenues, and Hi's
feeling, his emotional impulses, form the
best of these. In order to strengthen ani
train his will a child must be allowed to
exercise it by choosing for himself as far
as practicable. The parent or teacher
must advise the child before the choico
is made, or when he is suffering as a re
suit of an unwise choice he may well
reflect on them for not Riving him th*
benefit of their experience; but after both
sides are made plain the child must be
left a free moral apent. If there la a
choice between a pocketknlfe and a r*-v
pair of trousers a boy will almost surely
choose the knife. When he feels ashamed
of his patched knees it will be a means of
culture to his Jud R ment through the err.o

be in the line of reason. But it take*
more than one lesson to learn that *w*
cannot eat our cake and have It *oo *
Robertson says: 'There are two ways *f
reaching truth-by reasoning it out and by
feellne it out. A child must feel his wuy

not normal in ;t* condition. Should the build-

a consequent lnrreaw of trade between the
mill owners and the dealers, retail and whole-

SHELDON CRITICIZED
BY TOPEKA PREACHERS
Say That He Made Neither a News
paper Nor a Religious Journal of
the Capital.
Special Dtscatch to The Call.
TOPEKA, Kan.. April 2.â The ministers
of Topeka took a fall out of Rev. Charles
M. Sheldon to-day. The occasion was the
regular meeting of the Ministerial Union,
and the subject of discussion the recent
"Christian Daily" experiment/ About two
dozen ministers were present. With but
one exception all agreed that the experi
ment had been a failure, the consensus of
opinion being that Rev. Mr. Sheldon had
not only failed to make a good newspaper
out-of the Topeka Capital, but that he did
not even succeed In making It an up-to
date religious Journal. Dean John W.
Sykes of the Episcopal church declared
Rev. Sheldon had made a grave mistake
when he presumed to edit a newspaper
"as Jesus would." or in presuming to be
a Judge of what Jesus would have done or
said.
After nearly every minister present had
taken a ehot at him Rev. Mr. Sheldon
arose, stated he did not care to discuss his
experiment at this time, but would do so

ASKS TO BE
DROPPED FROM
CHURCH ROLLS
Chicago Presbytery Receives
the Resignation of
Dr. Hillis.
Action Is Delayed for Two Weeks
and There Is a Probability That
the Bequest> Will Ba
Denied.
1
CHICAGO. April 2.â The resignation of
Rev. Newell Dwlght Hlllls, pastor of
Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, from the
Chicago Presbytery and the request that
he be allowed to demit from the Presby
terian church was to-day placed before
the annual meeting of the Chicago Pres
bytery. No action will be taken on thu
matter for two weeks, the committee to
which Mr. mills' letter of resignation was
referred for consideration requesting that
much timÂ« on account of many important
interests involved and being unwilling: to
take hasty action on a matter so impor
tant to the Presbyterian church.
Dr. Hulls' resignation was in the form
of a letter to Dr. W. C. Gray, editor of
The Interior, and a personal friend of the
Brooklyn pastor, and when the aged
divine stepped upon the platform to pre
sent the letter to the Chicago Presbytery
the auditorium of Olivet Memorial
Church, in which the meeting was held,
was crowded to the doors, nearly every
Presbyterian minister in Chicago being
present. The reading of the letter, which
was a lengthy one, was followed with the
closest interest. It was generally known
before the meeting was called that Dr.
Hillis' resignation would be presented,
but his request that he be allowed to
demitâ in other words, that his name be
erased from the, rolls of the Presbyterian
church â occasioned a surprise.
Irr. Hillis' Letter.
In concluding his sensational letter Dr.
Hillis says;
For years I have urged the revision of our
cruel creed or the proposition of a new one.
I now perceive that my position haÂ» been mis
understood and nothing is left but for me to
withdraw. I withdraw, not to escape exist
ing responsibilities on my part, tor I shall
henceforth fulfill to the last decree my every
duty to the church, of Christ ; I withdraw to
free you from responsibility for me. From this
time, I am bound to my college, seminary an.l
brethren in the ministry, hut you are free
from embarrassment or responsibility for my
views. Hitherto disagreements In the pres
bytery have been accompanied by trials for
heresy and the disturbance of the church. I
hÂ«r.e that my withdrawal will strengthen
friendships, not Impair them; will make for
peace, rather than disturb tranquillity. For
I lay down my ministry, not that I may be
free to attack some non-essential in the creed
that may be dear to some of you, but only
that, without any embarrassment or friction.
I may be free to affirm those great positive
principles of the Christian faith that we all
agree upon and love as we love life itself.
I know full well that the public will mis
understand my frank words and that cynics
will say that I have worn my heart on my
Fleeve. For that reason. I address this letter
tr> my brethren in the presbytery of Chicago
and to you alonf. To all my friends in the
presbytery I send fcreetlnfrs and assurances of
esteem, -respect and affection, and to the end
that my views may cease to be an occasion
of disturbance In the presbytery. I now ask
you by unanimous vote to erase my name from
the presbytery and to permit me to demit my
ministry in the Presbyterian church.
Request May Be Denied.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
letter, a motion to refer It to a committee
of three for consideration was adopted
and Dr. J. G. K. McClurc president of
Lake Forest University: Dr. William tt.
Notman of the Fourth Church and Dr. W.
J. Chlchester of the First Church were
named. Dr. Merrick Johnson, president of
MeCormlck Theolo"'cal Seminary, who
had been named, vlthdrawlng on the
ground that he already expressed his opin
ion In favor of the acceptance of Dr. Hll
lis' resignation. The committee spent
some time In discussing the letter and fin
ally decided to ask for two weeks In
which to consider the matter before mak
ing any recommendation and the request
was granted by a unanimous vote.
Although none of the members of the
committee would express an opinion as to
the probable recommendation to be made,
many of the ministers present stated they
did not favor allowing Dr. Hlllls to demit,
as his opinions on certain Presbyterian
doctrines were not confined to himself,
and that therefore erasure of his name
from the rolls of the Presbyterian church
would be opposed. Such action, they
stated, would be regarded In a way as
favorable to Dr. Hillis, as It would allow
him to become a preacher of the Congre
gational Church without doctrinal exam
ination.

REPUBLICANS
VICTORIOUS IN
THE ELECTIONS
Heavy Fusion Plurality of
1898 in Cincinnati Is
Overturned.
Democratic Losses Reported From. All
Sections of Ohio â Bryanites
Make Slight Gains in
Michigan.
CINCINNATI. April 2.â A summary of
the results of the municipal and township
elections in Ohio to-day indicate more Re
publican than Democratic gains, but no
special cause for it is assigned, except
that the Republican factions that have
been fighting for years have evidently
been getting together and that the Demo
crats have shown more indifference than
usual. This applies especially to the
larger cities, but there have been Repub
lican gains, according to the returns frem
rural districts and Interior towns, that
are not accounted for. The result in Cin
r.ati. which on the average plurality more
than reverses the result at the last gen
eral municipal election, is attributed to
less factional fighting among the Repub
lican* and the Indifference of the Demo
crats.
In Cleveland, where the factions have
been most intense., the result is also de
cisive. A feature of the day has been the
election of Dr. Washington Gladden as a
Councilman at Columbus, where the
question of municipal franchises was a
epeciai issue. The writings of Dr. Glad
den on labor questions and social and po
litical economy ar-- w<?il known, as well
ts his work a*, a pastor and lecturer, and
his experience in a j ariiament of ward
representatives -*ill no doubt attract gen
eral interest.
The Republicans elected their ticket at
Toledo, where Mayor tamuel Jontb has
held sway a* <vi independent lactor for
years. At Dayton tht Democrats re-elect
ed Mayor Undrauth. At come Interior
points the Republicans elected oTUcers
where they had never elected them be
fore, while there have been no phenome
nal gains by the Democrats. As local
issues were paramount at almost Â«11
places It Is dlrncuit to indicate any cause
lor the drift of public preferences.
In this city tne Republicans elected
their entire ticket. They tiave the mem
bers of the new Board of Public Service
lur three years, which controls everything
except the police and fire departments.
The Board of Legislation stands 24 Re
publicans and 7 Democrats and the Board
of Education 24 Republicans and 7 Demo
crats.
Three years ago the fusion ticket was
elected by a plurality of 7445 on a total
vote of Â«io.(wo. The total vote was abu-ut
the to-cay and the plurality much
larger on the other side. Then, as now,
the fusion ticket was equally divided be
tw.t-.-ii the Democrats and what are
known locally as "Republicans wbo are
opposed to G*-orge li. Cox.." The tusion
lst* have carried this city and county re
râatedly. Last. November they elected

MRS ELIZABETH SAUNDERS
(The large portrait is her latest, taken a few days ago. The smaller is a
copy of one taken during her palmy days on the stage.)
TO-MORROW at her home. 510 Capp street. Mrs. Elizabeth Saunders will
receive her many friends and accept their congratulations In honor of
her eighty-first birthday anniversary^ Mrs. Saunders years ago gained
fame and fortune on the boards in thf> East and In this city, and Is
one of the remaining few who gained laurels in the palmy days of the fam
ous old California Theater Stock Company. Although the famous old lady de
clares her birthday reception is to be, as It always is, an Informal affair,
still she is making preparations to receive the many who always assemble
at her home on the 4th day of April of each year. The room in which Mrs.
Saunders' friends will assemble to talk of the days gone by Is an ldeaJ place
to inspire artistic reminiscence?. On the walls hang the portraits of cele
brated artists with whom the aged actress shared her early triumphs.' The
place of honor is occupied by Joe Jefferson, a cousin of the famous lady,
and on the mantel is a magnificent portrait of Edwin Booth, framed In a
wreath of immortelles.
Time has dealt gently with Mrs. Saunders. and though old in years, her
spirit is youthful. She speaks happily of her younger days, tells modestly
of her many early triumphs, and has a kindly word for all her many sisters
and brothers of the profession.
Mrs. Saunders will see her friends during the afternoon hours only and
from 2 till 7 all who have the honor to know the worthy artist will be wel
comed. '

Defeated Malay and Perseus
' in a Bumping Finish
at Oakland.
Three Favorites Scored on a Muddy
Track â Uarda XJnlooked For.
Flower of Gold a
Winner.
After Ab Stemler had vainly endeavored
to get Arbaces excused from the mile and
a sixteenth selling event, telling the
Judges his horse did not like the muddy
going, the bay horse went out and won,
showing that owners are not always right.
Jennie Reid had made, the Dace for the
greater portion of the route, when the
favorite, Malay, took up the running.
Fifty yards from home the field closed
on the leader and considerable of a bump-
Ing match occurred, during which Powell,
finishing oa the outside with Arbaces.
beat Malay out a neck. Topmast wa3
closing very fast, undoubtedly faring
worst In the mix-up.
Rain left the track In a sloppy condition,
still the horses ran fairly well to form.
Flower of Gold, In the last, bowted over
Dr. Nembula and The Fretter, much to
the consternation of the former's backers.
The Doctor carried the wise money, but
Walter Jennings' fleet filly led from the
start, leading the good thing out nearly
a length.
Foster & Hackett's Regelong spread
eagled the field of maidens, starting in the
opening six furlong run. The half brother
to Sulbross closed a slight favorite over
Poorlands and, fairly reveling in the slop
py going, won eased up to a walk. Milo
Melo, a 30 to 1 shot, finished second, in
front of Harry Corby.
This was followed by the Impressive win
of Albert Simons' filly Fidel Youlln, a 8
to 6 favorite. Soon heading Swiftwater,
Henry had the first choice up in his lap at
the wire, several lengths in advance of
Maydlne. Gussle Fay seems to have lost
all form, never looking dangerous.
There were ten starters In the two-year
old scramble, with the Burns & Water
house pair, Bernota and Homage,
closing slight favorites over Combermere.
The latter colt, as usual, showed a high
turn of speed out in front for a while,
then closing up finished third. Bernota
proved the easiest sort of a winner over
Illusion.
Pomplno went to the post favorite for
the fourth number, and his chances were
killed by racing out in front with Amasa.
Powell brought Uarda up the last part,
downing Orion a neck. The winner wa3 4Vfc
to 1 in the betting:

considerable work done In the line of se

one named up to last night in opposition
to him.- Dr. Morrison, the grand overseer,
who is In line for promotion to the office
of foreman, will have opposition. Grand

BUILDING CONTRACTORS
DO NOT OPPOSE SCALE
President McCarthy of That Trades
Council Says the Report Emanates
From Insignificant Persons.
ThÂ»Â» following communication, which is
*if If -explanatory, has been received at
tills office;
Editor <'a\\: In your lesue cf this morning
r.itpntton is called to an all" Red meeting of the
â¢ ontractors of this city having for itf purpose
an organization to oppose the iKroporcd wage
mslp ot J3 50 per day as the minimum rate of
lay for carpenters und the unionizing of the
lurtiiTseu.
This report emanates from a few Insignifi
cant <-r.3tractors, who, no doubt, would like to
:Â¦â¢â¢â¢ men an opoosttloa cain foothold, as they
never have paid the fcale if they could avoid
it. but fortunately for all connected with tfce
t.uildinc industry their petty ideais and desire*
are cor.Jin-d to themselves, and the contractors
of Ktandlns in thf community are not giving
the matter any feriou? thought.
When the proposed ohar.c in thp scale wan
contemplated three months apo, due notice was
civen- to all enntrartors, and, during the in
terim, every Dromir.ent contractor has *>x
presswd his approval of the same, and It ha*
â¢ <nly r*"H;aln<"d for theff few to now endeavor
to cain a little notoriety in tryintr to obstruct
jt- harmonious relations which have i-o long
existed. â¢ Â» ;
Ho far as unionizing foremen lit concerned
therÂ» It so controversy, as the few who ha.ye
not always b^en rcrmbTS of the organization
have sirce Joined.
Therefore it can be readily ?een that this
malicious attempt to disrupt harmonious re
lations and engender 111-feelinc between the
contractor* and the Building Trades Council
fca* absolutely no foundation in fact.

MADE THREATS TO
KILL HIS LANDLORD
T. M. Silvey Has an Exciting Experi
ence With Joseph Hodge, One
of His Tenants.
T. M. Silvey, Forest Grove, Wrights
Landing, is the owner of the house 921
Harrison street. Joseph Hodge occupies
the lower flat and Silvey has been trying
to get rid of him as a tenant for some
time.
Sunday afternoon Silvey went to the
house to show the upper flat to a pros
pective tenant and Hodge appeared on the
scene. He began to abuse Silvey. and fin
ally declaring he would kill Silvey, made
a rush at hint.
Silvey sprang out the back door and
escaped. Yesterday he swore to com
plaints In Judge Mogan's court â¢ for
Hodge's arrest on charges of threats to
kill and disturbing the peace. Hodge
was arrested and will appear'in court to

CHANGE OF BASE IN
FRED GRAY'S CASE
Blame for the Possession of Counter-
feiter's Tools Thrown Upon an
Acquitted Man.
The evidence in the case of Frederick
Gray, charged with having had a trunk
containing coin-counterfeiting tools in his
possession, was closed yesterday after
noon in the United States District Court.
This is Gray's third trial. He was in
dicted with George Hortcn last Septeni
tx-r. On the first trial the jury disagreed,
ihe defendants proving to the satisfac
tion of a portion of the jury that the
trunk and contents belonged to a man
whose residence was bellei'ed to be in
Alameda County, but who never could b*>
found. On ihe second trial the Jury ac
quitted Horton and disagreed as to Gray's
Kuilt.
ThÂ»> defense on this trial rs that the
tools were the property of George Horton:
that he brought them in a sack to the
room of John McCallum and afterward
plsred ih<--m in a trunk in the room occu
pied by Gray and Horton. McCallum was
brought down from the Folsom Deniton
le&tlary as a witness and testified to the
foregoing statement. He admitted that
Â«" had shot Horton a few days before the
latter's arrest and that he was serving
Â»ii!> sentence for assault to murder.
The case will be given to the jury to
day.
PADEREWSKI PLAYS
TO A LARGE HOUSE
BOTH the public and Paderewski out
did themselves yestc-rday. There was
a crush at the California and th<
pianist played with marked brillianc<
in<i elTe<t Â¦ *-
The programme began with the great
Bar h chromatic fantazia and fugue, a
prodigiously Intricate composition of the
purely classic type. This was followed by
Beethoven's sonata No. Ill, exalted in pas
sion and ix>etry but rather more scholar
ly and difficult than pleasing. The Schu
mann sonata Op. 11 was more to the taste
Of the audience and the great beauty that
is in it was given adequate Interpretation.
In the cluster of Chopin numbers that
followed Paderewski was at his best jn
the nocturne, the prelude and .the fer
ceuse. The first of these he gave with a
striking originality that was almost freak
ish in its altered time and eccentric
rhythm. Carreno played the. sostenuto
passages of this nocturne with a peculiar
monotony aggravated by a faint accent on
the second beat of each measure, but Pad
erewski introduces the tempo rubato to
fuch an extent that despite the interest
in his unique rendering, one cannot but
feel that the simple melodic flow of the
composition Is somewhat impaired. He
gave after the etude of the programme*,
the little B fiat etude with much more
spirit than at his first concert, and seemed
to be imbued* throughout the afternoon
with a more than ordinary degree of en
thusiasm. In the Chopin -Valse op. 34, No.
1. he surpassed himself and played the
number with a finer touch than can be
found in his other interpretations of Cho
pin's other dances. The second rhapsodic
of Liszt finished the programme and
proved as astounding in point of color and
execution as it always does in Paderew
skl's hands.
MADLY INFATUATED
WITH HIS LANDLADY
John Shaunessy Arrested for Threat
ening to Kill Mrs. C. D. Parm- â¢
elee and Himself.
John Shaunessy's infatuation Â¦ for his
handsome landlady, Mrs. C. D. Parmelee
of 439 Jessie street, has landed him in Jail
on charges of disturbing the pence and
threats to kill. Shaunessy has long nour
ished an affection for Mrs. Parmelee, but
kept his own counsel till Sunday night.
Mrs. Parmelee, whoso husband is in
Fresno, was confined to her bed with
rheumatism when Shaunessy knocked on
her door and entered about H o'clock Sun
day night. He talked to her for A. few
minutes about her husband and then his
passion broke out and he told her how
much he loved her. He declared that he
could not live without her and he intended
to kill her and himself.
Mrs. Parmelee screamed for help and
Mrs. Annie Hughes, one of the roomers,
W u e , nt J . t ? J ncr assistance. After consider
able difficulty Mrs. Hughes forced Shaun
essy out of the room and locked the door.
The women remained in the room for
nearly three hours, Shaunessy occasional
ly trying to break, open the door. Fin
ally some of the male roomers came home
and Policeman McCormick was sum
moned. He placed the enamored Shaun
essy under arrest. The cases were called
in Judge CabanissV court yesterday and
continued till Thursday.
Sues for Maintenance.
Mary Fisher filed suit yesterday against
her husband. Joseph Fisher, for main

ATTENDED A RECEPTION
They Were the Guests of Magnolia
Lodge of This Cityâ Candidates
for Varius Grand Offices.
The representatives to the Grand Lodge
of the Ancient Order of United Workmen

last evening. The major portion of all
who will attend the opening sesrr.on were
first at a meeting of the Past Masters'
Association in Shiels building and later
were the guests of Magnolia Lodge in Red
Men's Hall. At the first meeting there
were present many of the past and present
grand officers and many congratulatory
speeches were made on the~work that has
been done In the past year.
At the reception tendered by Magnolia
Lodge in the banquet hall of the Red
Men's building there was set out an excel
lent collation that was partaken of by
more than three hundred master work

Lecture on Extinct Animal Life.
Dr. John C. Merriman, professor of
palaeontology at the University of Cali
fornia, delivered an interesting- lecture
last night in the Academy of Sciences
Hall. The subject was "Extinct Animal
Lifa of the Bad Lands" and the lecture
was finely illustrated by lantern sl.'des. A
large audience was in attendance.
THE annual banquet of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association
took place in the Palace Hotel last
evening. President A. Sbarboro pre
sided. There were seven tables,
around which sat some of the most repre
sentative men of San Francisco. One long
tank- was fronted by invited guests, em
bracing President Wheeler; representative
of the Interstate Commerce Commission;
the Philadelphia Commercial Museum; the
University of California; the army of the
United StatÂ«-s; the liar and press of Cali
fornia, and all the commercial and manu
facturing organizations of the city.
Mr. Sbarboro made a happy toastmas
ter. In his opening remarks he called at
tention to the local prosperity of the past
year and predicted that the present year
would be the most prosperous in the his
tory of California. He then proposed the
rising toast of "The President of the
United States." The orchestra played
"The Star-spangled Banner" and the en-
| tire company united In singing the na
tional anthem.
General W. H. L. Barnes responded to
the. toast. When he mentioned the name
of William McKinley there were cheers
all over the room. He said that he had re
cently visited the President. When he
found how gentle and courteous the na
tion's Executive was he had thought it
true at last that God had created man In
His own image. The history of the various
acquisitions of territory by the United
States was recounted. In every instance
thore had been criticism. Such was the
fact now with the present administration.
There had been wise men. presidents of
colleges â God save the mark (laughter and
applause)â who had thought in their time
that the chief of the Seminole Indians,
when the acquisition of Florida was dis
cussed, was the Aguinaldo of his time.
There were wise and good men to-day who
condemned the administration for carry
ing out a wise and high purposeâ not for
imperialism. No people could Malayize the
United Suites. On the contrary, the United
States would Americanize all comers. The
true American gentleman had no fear ot
the American flag, wherever it, floated.
The American gentleman saw in the ilag
ADOLPH STLVA of Sausalito was
the first witness the defense in the
Fair case put upon the stand yes
terday morning and he proved a
lyddite bomb. Glib, keen, pugna
cious and without an exhibition of re
morse for the nefarious part which he
claims to have played, he told a story of
corruption and bribery that smells like
a garbage pile.
According to Sylva's testimony he -was
approached by the Craven-Fair attorneys
and tne petitioner herself to secure some
Justice of the Peace of Sausalito to swear
falsely that he had married Mrs. Nettie
R. Craven to Senator Fair. As his dec
larations on the stand go. Judge Simpton
also entered Into the conspiracy for .the
sole purpose of confounding the lady peti
tioner. At the last moment, when the
Pence brotherhood and Mrs. Craven-Fair
intended to call Sylva and Simpton to for
tify their cause then the surprise was to
be launched at their heads, not so much
for the love of justice, but out of a deep
friendship for Joe Harvey and Charles
Fair, both of whom Sylva claims to have
known on most Intimate terms.
Double Cross Story.
This was Sylva's story told unblushing
ly and rejoicingly under the direction or
George Knight and steadfastly clung to
under the cross-examination of Lafe
Pence. With an unctuous delight in his
work the Sausalito politician reeled off a
tale trippingly from the tongue, glorying
in the fact, as he asserted, that the peti
tioner had come to him to put the finish
ing touches upon the corrupt, bribe-reek
ing scheme. So well was he prepared in
his testimony and so sharp as to details
that Lafe Pence could do nothing with
him hi cross-examination. The morning
session was consumed with the direct .ex
amination of Sylva; the afternoon was
given over to Pence on cross-examination,
but he is not yet finished with the Sausa
lito trickster, who will mount the stand
again this morning.
Galaxy of Attorneys.
./hen the court opened for the continu
ation of the trial nearly every attorney
connected with me case was present. The
.fences. Kuef and Denaon played a tattoo
upon their table and opposite them were
MciSiierney, Pierson. Knight, ex-Governor
Budd, Van R. Paterson, Crothers and
Sutro. In the afternoon sons-in-law Oel
richs and Koehler strolled in and listened
with an attentive ear. â¢ Even Reuben
Lloyd found a place with the Fair galaxy
late in the day, only to hear some scath
ing shots which Sylva declared to have
beert thrown by Mrs. Craven-Fair in
speaking of the of attorneys
Lloyd smiled, as the crowd which packed
tlie courtroom fastened eager eyes upon
lU He'fore Sylva took the stand Lafe Pence
tried to reach an estimate of the value of
the Fair estate in order to fix the
widow's portion.. In four years the grosj
income of the Fair estate was $b.310.x&Â« 4VÂ»
from which, after a deduction nf^rs of
property, etc., amounting to $3. U .4,1J4 Â«S.
theie was left $2i>26.70T 11. This seemed to
satisfy the Pences and they took their
seats, surrendering the field of action to
Knight. McEnerney, Pierson et al.
Sylva Eager for the Plot.
There was no mistaking Sylva s alacrity
and eagerness to free himself of his story.
George Knight had little labor with him.
Not only did he recollect each individual
meeting with Mrs. Craven-Fair and the
Pences but he narrated the conversa
tions that took place with exactness. In
the early part of August Sylva first met
Mrs Craven-Fair. As the witness' tesr
timony runs, she came over to Sausalito
on August 2. 1599. with Dunand and called
upon him. The petitioner stated that she
wanted him to hunt up the record of her
marriage which took place in ISO 2. But
before Sylva would interest himself in
the case he asked for a retainer. After
some quibbling $200 was the price set and
Mrs. Craven-Fair gave him a check for
that amount. It was signed Xettie: R.
Craven, but she afterward squeezed in
the word Fair. Once her attested client
Dunand left and then Mrs. Craven-Fair
had a heart-to-heart talk with Sylva. who
informed her all about the previous liti
gation. Jury-bribing, etc., for he was the
"Pooh-Bah" of Sausalito. After a prom
ise of- $20,000, all of which was to come
from son-in-law Koehler. Sylva agreed
to get a Justice of the Peace to swear to
any old thing.
Scheme Develops.
Several meetings on succeeding days ad
vanced the scheme peg by peg. Slmpton
was the Justice decided upon .-tnd Sylva
was to do the negotiating. There were
conferences with Simpton. Dunand and
Sylva and talk about a $30,000 stipulation
which Dunand was to sign for Sylva's
benefit. This afterward ripened into the
contract made in Dunand's office. Sylva
dictated the latter part of this contract
Just to show that it was not one-sided and
there was a valid consideration attached.
Then the scene shifted to the law offices
of Ponce & Pence after a lapse of a few
months. At this time Sylva, who was
heart and soul in the scheme, was rushing
from Sausa'lito to the Parrott building,
where he alleges rehearsals were the or
der of the day and night.
"Oh. they fell into the trap like a hun
gry mouse after cheese." said Svlva. Hp
told of the affidavit, but explained it
away as glibly as he recited all other de
tails.
Was a Tough Witness.
Lafe Pence was anything but frisky in
the cross-examination. He obtained from
the witness a description of his Sausalltn
home and -the fact that during the tlrst
interview his sister overheard every word
if the conversation between Mrs. (.raven-
Fair and himself. She wlll.be called upon
Lhe stand. Pence's interviews' with Siiva
were referred to. and the witness insin
uated that that attorney was in the
scheme to loot the Fair estate.
All for the love of Joe Harvey, a close
friend of Charles Fair, was the motive as
signed by Sylva for his connection with
the ca=e. Sylva declared that the day
aftor the first meeting with Mrs. Craven-
Fair he notified Joe Harvey of the scheme
and the latter told George Knight. From
that time on he w;ts bothered by Harvey,
at the instance of Knight, to make an
affidavit exposing the Infamous conduct
of the CraTen-FalT parties. To this -course
fcylva turned a deaf ear. reserving for a
coup de graoe his knowledge of the plot
to be exposed as a surprise on the stand.
Finally Sylva listened to the pleadings
and signed the famous midnight affidavit.
ADOLPH SYLVA TELLING HIS SENSATIONAL STORY.
the promise of justice and right and the
benediction of God, wherever it floated.
n Mayor Phelan welcomed the guests
*fl om abroad - speaking briefly. He said
tnat patriotism was as wide as the coun
try. The guests were welcomed as citi
zens of a common country; not in the
sn I r 't of commercialism alone.
Director Wilson of the Philadelphia
Commercial Museum made the speech of
the evening. He described the work of
the museum. He was greeted with the
singing of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow,"
and he said that this was only the contin
uation ot" the experience he had so far
met with in California. He praised highly
the scenery, the wines and othor products
of California. This State, through its
fruits, was in the moufh of all the coun
try. He then described some of the re
markable work of the Philadelphia . Mu
seum. It had extended correspondence
until It now had connections with SO.OOO
foreign business houses: in this corre
spondence $50,000 was expended for post
age alone last year; forty thousand busi
ness houses in the United States had been
placed on the classified lists of the
Â¦museum for foreign circulation; the mu
seum had connection with correspondence,
to establish the rating of foreign houses,
with* 1600 foreign banks; agents had been
sent to every commercial country In the
world, except India, to investigate and
report; card cabinets, containing 60,(100
cards each, relating to American houses,
have been sent to forty-five foreign coun
tries; thirty foreign goverments are send
ing all thoir publications and the commer
cial publications of all other foreign
countries are secured; eleven hundred
foreign publications were' regularly re
ceived and a department of experts was
constantly digesting all matters received
and sending our reports to American busi
ness and manufacturing concerns; mar
kets had been made for American wares
in a great number of instances which
were quoted.
Dp to last year over 150,000 samples of
foreign products had been accumulated.
The museum could never have succeeded
if it had been a private concern, but It
was a municipal institution. Philadelphia
had been contributing $115,000 annually to
the museum for the past three years.
Last year the museum put SfiOO.OOO into
new buildings. He looked forward to the
time when San Francisco would not only
equal but surpass the present greatest
port of the commercial center or the
United States.
President Wheeler responded for the
Pacific Commercial Museum, which, as he
said, could only succeed by doing hard
work. The opportunity held out by Phila
delphia to San Francisco was of the first
water. He spoke of i the nobility, the
largeness of spirit that characterized
Philadelphia in this matter. There was
no niggardliness, no counting of what
benefit the offer would give rise to. He
wished that all present would work to
help Philadelphia get .the appropriation
that is sought from Congress. Philadel
phia and San Francisco had common
cause in this matter. This was the place
for a sister institution to arise.
Irving M. Scott, speaking for "Home In
dustries," also spoke In high praise of
"the magnilicent institution described by
Director Wilson of Philadelphia."- He al
luded to the destiny of San Francisco, and
said that what the people need Is a reign
of law and liberty, progress and internal
and external expansion. In an Jmpas-
Bioned eulogy of California. Mr. Scott's
voice almost failed him, and he sat down
evidently moved with his subject.
General Shafter. speaking for the army,
was greeted with cheers and a rising
toast.
Chairman Knapp of the Interstate Com
merce Commission dealt largely with the
groat results that have followed the Intro
duction of transportation by steam in rev
olutionizing the world. The first step that
Congress took to assert itself in the regu
lation and restraint of transportation cor
porations would not be retraced. Congress
would go on. The recklessness of private
ownership and the cupidity of corpora
tions would be held in check for the good
of the entire country. Judge Knapp was
amazed by the wonders of California. He
complimented the witnesses before the In
terstate Commission who have testified in
this State for their grasp of the problem
of transportation, and also the attorneys
who have appeared as "the peers of any
member of the bar of the United States."
At a very late hour M. H. de Young:
spoke, responding to the toast of "The
Press."
