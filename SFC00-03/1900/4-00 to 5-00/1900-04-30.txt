VETSERA'S WOMEN VICTIMS WERE SO
FRIGHTENED THEY COULD NOT STIR
â¢
mRS. STEDDON. Miss Beeman and Miss Bennett, the women held trp
In Oakland by Vetsera, are employed as domestics at the residence
of P. X- Bowles, president the First National D*nk, 317 Boulevard
terrace. In relating their experience one of the trio stated: "We
had finished our work and were taking a short walk preliminary to retiring
for the night. We had no idea that we would be victims of a footpad.
When he Jumped out and pointed his pistol at us I thought I would faint.
I attempted to run, but my feet were like lead and refused to move. My
companions recovered themselves and screamed. The noise they made
aroused me to a sense of my surroundings. Not one of us stood on cere
mony, but ran like frightened sheep. The brute yelled for us to stop, but
we took no heed of his cries and only ran the faster. Ha pursued us a short
distance. He evidently feared capture, as our screams had alarmed the neigh
borhood, and he fled in the opposite direction.
"When we reached Mr. Bowles' house we were exhausted from fright.
The shock we received was a terrible one and our nerves are still unstrung.
I don't want to see that fellow again. I don't think any of us could identify
him. His face was covered with a dark cloth and when he Jumped out we
thought he was a negro."
"Why, when those women screamed I
was so frightened that I did not stop to
see which way they ran. I Just took off
as fast as I could and perhaps they im
agined I was pursuing them.
"It was hunger and plenty of it that
started me on this. When Chief Hodg
kins gave me some supper after I had
been arrested it was the first food I had
tasted for nearly thirty-six hours. Well,
there will be a place for me to sleep and
something to eat If nothing more. I hope
to God my people will never hear of this.
They do not know in what part of the
world I am and I will be happy if they
never find me again."
When told that the Austrian Consul had
denied his story Vetsera said:
."I am willing to confess that I have
taken every precaution to bury my family
name so that disgrace shall never come
upon my people from any act of mine. My
family Is too proud and aristocratic for
me to bring shame upon them. The Aus
trian Consul may not know me under the
name of Vetsera, but If he were told my
family name he could not fail to know it.
It is one of the proudest names in Austria.
My father is an officer of the rank corre
sponding to that of brigadier general in
the United States. One of my brothers is
a lieutenant in the Hungarian Hussars. I
am not a relative of the Baroness Vetsera.
and have no desire now to sail under false
colors except to protect my family name
and honor.
"I left home because I could not uphold
the family name, and I am not going to
drag it into the mud now. My passports,
which were vised by the Austrian Consul
every six months, secured me my posi
tions, but I had sent them East because
I did not desire that my true family name
should be discovered. The Austrian Con
sul would have no difficulty In identifying
me if he had that name repeated to him."
ON"CE agtdn is shame and dis
credit cast upon the nobility
of Austria by crime committed
in San Francisco. Jcsef Blanther, the
cruel murderer of Mrs. Langfeldt,
Â¦cms a descendant of a noble house of
Frnncis Joseph's empire, and now
Simon L. Munckrosvon Vetsera, the
youthful footpad who terrorized the j
residentr of the Western Addition
and came to grief in Oakland, claims j
that his name is linked with that of
the ccurt of Austria.
The name he gives is the same a3
that of the late Baroness Marie Vet
eera, -whose tragic death at Meyer
ling-, vrith Crown Prince Rudolph, in
January. 1889, shocked the civilized
world. All yesterday he intimated <
that they had been blood relatives,
but late last night he broke down
and admitted that he and the Baron
ess were not members of the same
family. While insisting that he is of
the Austrian nobility, he confesses
that the name he has given the police
authorities is not his true title.
The footpad says his father is a
commanding general in Francis
Joseph's army, but beyond this he
refuses to give any details as to his
antecedents except to say that his !
tamily is one of the most aristocratic i
in all Austria.

Finally he reached Los Angeles , and

AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN CONSUL
DENIES HIGHWAYMAN'S STORY
\\ â^RANCIS KORBEL, Austro-Hungarian Consul In this city, denies Vet
jj= a erra's statement that he has received remittances through him and
H doubts that he is a member of the Vetsera family of the Austrian no- j
billty. "This man, whoever he Is, has been receiving no remittances
through me." said the Consul. "That is positive, because I have received no
money for any person in any way answering his description or near his age.
I know wcJl all those whom I have received money for and no such person as
this footpad is among them.
"He could not have received remittances through the Austrian Ambassa
dor at Washington without my knowledge, for the Embassador would send
all remittances for persons here through me.
"I don't believe the prisoner is a member of the Vetsera family. I am
of the opinion that all the members of it can be accounted for. This family
was almost extinct at the time the Baroness Marie died. She had but one
Lrother. who would now be about 49 years old, and he never married. Out
side of her immediate family I know of no Vctseras in Austriaâ no cousins
or any other relatives, though there may bo some.
"The Wtscras were at any rate not a numerous family. Their estates
were nearly exhausted, but although poor they had entre to court society
and were rated among the best of the nobility.
"The fir?t name, Simon, which this young man claims to bear, is not an
Austrian name."
Mr. Korbel also stated that he knew of no mining man in this city who
could possibly be the uncle of the footpad. He said:
"In the Austrian colony here there is but one mining engineer. He re
sides in Oakland and lias done so for the past thirty years to my knowledge.
1 believe that he has no family connection whatever with the criminal. In
the name 'Mcnckorosvon,' which the footpad gives as part of his title, I
think the 'yon' should be a separate word, making the correct name L.
Monckoros yon Vetsera."

WOMEN VOTERS FIGHT
IN AN IDAHO TOWN
Their Arrest Follows and a Jury of the
Fair Sex Mixes Up While De
ciding the Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, April 29.â A story of a very unusual proceeding comes from
.Wciser. A good deal of feeling had been worked up over a local election. In
which the women, who may vote in this State, took a deep Interest. On elec
tion day the women were thick about the polls, and two of them, Mrs. Martin
son and Miss Harris, the latter a spinster, indulged In a heated altercation
over the merits of their respective candidates. The argument was brought to
a close by Mrs. Martinson saying:
"If I were running for office and I found out that a withered up, china
faced hag like you was working for me, I would not vote for myself."
The words had scarcely left her lips when Miss Harris reached over and
clawed her veil and a lot of epidermis from her face. Mrs. Martinson respond
ed by giving her antagonist a resounding slap on the face that sent her bonnet
to the side of her head. The women then clinched, and such a hair-pulling
and scratching match was never before witnessed In that usually quiet vil
lage. It was all over in a few seconds. The combatants were separated and
led off, their faces zlg-zagged with scratches. Each woman had the other ar
rested, and Mrs. Martinson's trial was held first. A jury of women was sum
moned, and after the evidence had been taken the jurors retired to deliberate.
Before a great while the bailiff heard screaming inside the jury-room. Forcing
the door, he witnessed a free-for-all mix-up among the jurors, who. it devel
oped, were strong friends of one or the other of the women under arrest. The
officer quieted the jurors after a great deal of trouble, and they filed into
court a sorry looking aggregation, reporting a disagreement. The bailiff
picked up a bucketful of hatpins, switches, ribbons and other feminine adorn
ment. The Judge reprimanded the women and turned both the prisoners loose.
Feeling still runs high in Weiser, it is said, and the attendance at church io
cials has been reduced about one-half.
Struck His Aged Mother.
Thomas Mahoney. a millhand living at
1143 Howard street, went home drunk yes
terday morning and demanded money
from his aged mother to "rush the grow
ler." She advised him to go to bed, but
he compelled her to give him 10 cents.
He went out and when he returned he
struck her and chased her out of the
house. Bareheaded, she walked to the
Southern police station and Policemen
McGrayan and Peterson were sent in the
patrol wagon to arrest Mahoney. He
showed fight and had to be thrown down
and handcuffed. He was charged at tho
City Prison with disturbing the peace.
Oakland and, lastly, had been a polisher
of silverware at the Van Nuys Hotel in
Los Angeles. It was there he fell, he
says, into evil companionship.
For all his troubles, his entire worldly
possessions consist now of half a dozen
suits of clothes, held by a lodging-house
keeper in San Francisco for unpaid room
rent; one pistol and black silk handker
chief, held as evidence by the Oakland
police, and the following items: Two
brass white enamel collar buttons, one
imitation diamond button, one old comb,
one old empty purse, one needle, two pen
cils, one soiled handkerchief, one pocket
mirror, a rosary and a silver card case
cover with name engraved thereon.
Vetsera has a marked countenance. His
features are marred by a misshapen nose,
the bridge of which has been smashed
flat,' while the tip' projects with Cyrano
de Bergerac prominence. This, the lad
says, was caused by a fall he sustained
while a messboy on a North German
Lloyd steamer on the Atlantic.
With barely a growth of beard on his
face, the boy has nothing to commend
himself to a thief taker. His garments
are a black coat and trousers with a
fancy brocaded waistcoat. The hat is
a fuzzy gray fedora. There Is nothing
about him to suggest the daring highway
man of the Western Addition. When he
was captured Saturday night by Detec
tives Kyte and Hamerton the lad had
eaten no food for twenty-four hours.
Since his female companion disappeared
and went to Portland food had been
scarce with Vetsera. He declared he was
too proud to beg. Indeed, he says that
he intended to merely ask for money from
his first victim, but being refused resorted
to the display of his pistol.
But -withal hunger and desperation and
rough knocks there was a vein of feeling
struck in the youth every time home was
brought to his mind.
"My home was in Galicia," said Vet
sera, when he was fairly ready to tell his
story. "My family name is the only one
in our home. It is six hours by railroad
from Vienna. That is all you can know
from me about that. My father is a com
mander in the Austrian army and I was to
be given an education to fit me for similar
service. When I was 12 years old my
father put me In the military school at
Vienna, but I did not get along very well.
I failed several times to pass the quar
terly examinations and finally my father
became disgusted and sent me away to
the naval school at Stettin, Germany. I
tired of the work there, and not getting
along very well decided to leave. I could
not go home because my father was much
displeased because I did not do better at
school. So my brother, and my uncle
helped me with money. I had $1000 w-hen I
left home. I decided to go to sea, and I
went as a mess boy on a steamer from
Bremerhayen to Australia. I went back
to Hamburg, and for some time worked
as a mess boy on the North German
Lloyd steamers between that city and
New York. That Is when my nose was
broken.
"I remained finally in New York, work
ing in several stores. With my recom
mendations from home I got along pretty
well until I started out West. I managed
to hold on to the money I brought with
mo until I got to San Francisco and met
my uncle. He induced me to buy a lot of
mining stock, and I was called upon to
pay an assessment of $100, but I had no
more money to pay with, so my uncle took
part of the stock for security. Then more
assessments came, and at last all of my
stock was gone and my money had van
ished."
"But your family must have been will-
Ing to aid you," was suggested.
"No. I would not write to them any
more. And now, it would kill my mother
If she knew of this," sobbed the lad,, the
tears coursing down his cheeks.
"And your family? You remember the
Princess Vetsera?" queried a listener.
Not a word of reply, only the continued
weeping. Direct questions were evaded,
and Indirect effort was warded off gently,
but with determination not to disclose the
secret.
The lad rambled on with his story' The
next event that seemed - k strongly im
pressed was the meeting at Los Angeles
with the creature of the night whom he
claims is responsible for his undoing.
"I had a good job at tho Van Nuys Ho
tel." earning J2S a month when I met her
and she told me to come with her," said
the boy. "We came to San Francisco.
Who is she? I won't tell you, but plenty
of people know her around the Thalia and
the dance halls. She Is older than I amâ
thirty years old at least. Two weeks ago
she left me suddenly. I thought I would
try to get money enough to follow her to
Portland, where her trunk was sent, and
maybe I would have killed her, and my
self, too."
Then the days of hunger came on. Vet
sera' b vain appeal to the uncle is told this
way:
"I went to my uncle for money. He
said: 'Go pawn your clothes. "When they
are gone come back to me.' What was
to hold him here or turn their prisoner
over to the San Francisco department.
Chief of Police Sullivan and Captain of
Detectives John Seymour went to Oak
land yesterday afternon, held a long
interview with the prisoner and decided
that his story was true beyond any ques
tion of doubt.
The San Francisco police officials ex
pressed themselves as highly gratified
over the capture of the highwayman and
offered their congratulations to Chief of
Police Hodgkins and Night Police Cap
tain Peterson upon the skillful work ac
complished.
Chief Sullivan, Captain Seymour and
Chief HodgkirtS had an interview with
Vetsera, during which he related to the
San Francisco officials with circumstantial
detail the part. he had taken in the four
robberies." At .the conclusion , of the in
terview the officers from this city declared
that they were satisfied beyond any doubt
of the truth of the young man's remark
able narrative. Chief Sullivan's opinion
was that the story was a strange tale,
but marked absolutely with the surest evi
dence of truth.
The youth's reasons for concealing cer
tain facts were, in their opinion, amply
justified. He had desired above all else to
prevent his parents from securing any
dlrect Information concerning his plight.
Not, indeed, because of himself, but fearing
with evident alarm the effect of the shock
upon his mother. Ignorant of the, scope
of publicity which would surround the
news of his arrest the boy was ostrich
like in trying to hide his head, believing
that he would sufficiently conceal himself
from the kinsfolk far across the sea.
Charges of assault with Intent to rob
will be made against Vetsera to-day.
Chief Hodgkins requested Charles S.
Greene, librarian of the Oakland Free
Library, and Harris Allen, who were held
up Saturday night, to swear to com
plaints against the youth on Tuesday
morning. Allen positively identified the
young man yesterday and Greene partial
ly recognized the prisoner from his voice.
Allen's identification was complete, rec
ognizing both voice, general bearing and
garments.
Mr. Greene said: "When I was halted
the young man stepped out from the trees'
shadow, pointed a pistol at me and com
manded me to throw up my hands. In
stead of obeying I started to run, and as
I- made off I heard the snap of a pistol,
but there was no shot fired. I hastened
on down Jackson street to my home. I
think the footpad followed me a few
steps, but to tell the truth I didn't stop
to find out.
"He was not close enough for me to get
as good a view of him as did Mr. Allen.
The latter resides at the same place that
I do. When I walked into the house I
found him teHlng the story of his experi
ence with the robber. It was much more
exciting than mine, although the sensa
tion of having a pistol snapped at one is
by no means the most delightful in the
world.
"Mr. Allen was some distance ahead of
me when he was stopped, just as I was.
He resisted and the highwayman tried to
tear open his overcoat to reach for his
watch."
"I resisted," said Allen, "and during the
tussle the footpad twice pulled the trigger
of his pistol, but there was no shot. I
made haste when I had broken away from
his hold, but during the struggle I had a
pretty fair idea of the man and there was
no difficulty in identifying him."
The two charges to be lodged against
Vetsera mean imprisonment for him,
should he plead guilty, of from one to
fourteen years on each accusation. That
seems to be a matter of no concern to
Vetsera. His only desire appears to be
that he shall speedily be sent to the peni
tentiary.
In view of Vetsera's moody condition
and his repeated threats to commit sui
cide, Chief Hodgkins has placed a special
watch upon the lad. Tne police will com
municate to-day with the Austrian Con
sulate, unless some official from that of
fice shall present himself at the police
headquarters in Oakland beforehand. So
far as the police are concerned, the weak
est point In the story Is the young man's
evident satisfaction with his manner of
living for the six months of his associa
tion with his female companion. He ad
mitted that he had not worked during
that time, although he declared in almost
the same breath that had he never met
this charmer he would have continued in
his menial employment at Los Angeles.
Vetsera Insisted that he had no murder
In his heart when he set forth on his ma
rauding expedition in Oakland. He ex
plained that while he had snapped his
pistol several times at Harris Allen dur
ing their tussle at' Fourteenth and Jack
son streets Saturday evening, Allen would
not have been shot.
."I fixed the pistol," said the lad, "so
the cartridge cylinder would not revolve
and ' the hammer rested on an empty
chamber. I took the lock pin and thrust
it through the empty chamber and that
locked the cylinder. I did not want to
kill any one. . .__ â ._
the use of that? I knew what would be
his answer. He is my mother's brother,
so has not my family name.
"After thatâ l think last Friday weekâ
my last cent was gone and I could not
get any more clothes, because the land
lord held them for my room rent. A pair
of shoes went for the pistol and I started
out determined to get money some way
or another. . ;
"I made up my mind if I was caught
by a policeman to kill myself rather than
go to jail. Sunday night I started out
with my pistol and handkerchief. I didn't
use any mask tho first night. I was hun
gry enough to do most anything, but I
decided to ask the man I met for money.
This man was, according to the newspa
pers I read the next day, Edward North
rup. He was with a lady.- Wljat attract
ed my attention was 'a big diamond he
wore. Stepping up to him I said: 'Good
evening. Could you let me have 10 cents.'
" 'Get out, d n you,' was the reply.
"Then I showed the pistol and that
made him go into his pockets. He handed
me 35 cents. The lady with, him offered
me her purse.
"I told her that I did not want her
money. That night I spent 25 cents for
lodging and 10 cents for supper. The next
day I went about the streets hungry and
half crazy. I said to myself: 'If you are
lucky you may catch some rich fellow,
get enough money and then go away to
the mines.'
"Monday night I went out again in the
Western Addition and held up the man I
learned was John J. Deane. I put on the
mask and hid behind the trees. When he
came along I jumped out at him. He was
with a lady. When I asked him for money
he handed me a couple of dollars mighty
quick, saying: 'Put that gun away; those
holes look too big.'
"The next man was Rodgers, on Tues
day night. I really did not mean to shoot
him. The pistol went off accidentally, I
guess. The pistol went off when he ran
out into the street. I don't think he was
half as badly. scared as I was. I was so
frightened that I could not have fired the
pistol again if I had tried to.
"That hold-up was out on Jackson
street, or a street on which cable cars
were running, for there was one half way
down the block when the cartridge ex
ploded.
"The last man I held up was Sidemann,
the newspapers call him. There were five
men around the street corner when he
knocked the money he gave me out of my
hand.
"He said when I stepped up to him with
my mask on and put the pistol toward
" 'No, I am not; give me your money.'
" 'Oh, take off that handkerchief and
come take a drink,' he said.
" 'Give me your money
"Then he realized that I wasn't joking.
In handing me some coin he hit the back
of my hand and knocked the money on the
sidewalk. I stooped to pick up what I
could, about a dollar I should think,
then I started off. Somebody cried 'Stop
that robber,' but the men 6n the corner
did not want any robber and I heard one
say, 'I'll not go after him.'.
"The little money I got soon went, and
after borrowing 25 cents in San Francisco
I started for Oakland Saturday morning,
spending my last cent to come over on the
creek boat. I began to be afraid that if
I kept on in the city I might be captured.
I really did not care very much, because
I would have killed myself if I got a
chance. I had much the same experience
in Oakland as in San Francisco, 'but the
people I held up got away from me. I
was too nervous to do much, if anything,
and I was getting weak from lack of
food.
"I am glad to be here. It is better than
walking the streets. How long will it
take for me to be sent to San Quentin?"
asked Vetsera of Chief Hodgkins.
"Oh, a week or so," was the reply.
VI want to go there as quickly as pos
sible. I might have a better chance to put
a hole in my head."
"But do you not want to go home
again?" .
"Yes: but it would not do for me to go
now after this. I could not go home.
"Besides, there is no use in trying to get
help from my people. The Consul might
be able to fix some bonds for me, but my
folks wouldn't care to spend thousands of
dollars. I shall try to end my life as soon
as possible. Then It will all be over."
So far as he would disclose, Vetsera In
dicated that his parents were wealthy and
had large estates of ancient title. He said
there were two other brothersâ one a year
younger than himself, now in a military
school at Vienna,' the other a second lieu
tenant of Hussars.' There is one sister, 8
years old.
The young man had accomplishments
before his' four years of hard knocking
about the world dulled him. He had part
ly mastered French, German, Russian,
Polish arid English before he fled from the
Stettin academy.
The police are undecided to-day whether

AN OBJECT LESSON.
In a Restaurant.
A physician puts the query: Have you
never noticed in any large restaurant at
lunch or dir.ner time the large number of
hearty> vigorous old men at the tables;
men whose ages run from CO to 80 years,
many of them bald and all perhaps gray,
but none of them feeble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle is so common as
to have escaped your observation or com-
ment, but nevertheless It Is an object les-
son which mean? something.
If you will notice what these hearty old
fellows are eating you will observe that
they are not munching bran crackers nor
gingerly picking their way through a
menu card of new f angled health foods;
on the contrary, they seem to prefer a
Juicy roast of beef, a properly turned loin
of mutton and even the deadly broiled lob-
ster is not altogether Ignored. *
The point of all this is that a vigorous
old age depends upon good digestion and
plenty of wholesome food, and not upon
dieting and an endeavor to live upon bran
crackers.
There Is a certain class of food cranks
who seem to believe that meat, coffee and
many other good things are rank poisons.
but these cadaverous, sickly looking indi-
viduals are a walking condemnation of
their own theories.
The matter in a nutshell is that If the
stomach tecretes the natural digestive
JuJces in sufficient quantity any whole-
some food will be promptly digested; if
the stomach does not do so, and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal will re-
move all difficulty, because they supply
Just what every weak stomach lacks, pep-
sin, hydrochloric acid, diastase and nux.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and Jn fact are not
ftrictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting it
thoroughly, and thus give a much needed
rest, and giving an appetite for the next
meal.
Of people who travel nine out oi ten use
etuarfÃ Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing: them
to be perfectly safe to use at any time,
and also having found out by experience
that they are a safeguard against indi-
gestion in any form, and eating, as they
have to, at all hours and all kinds of
food, the traveling public for years have
pinned their faith to Stuart's Tablets.
All drugpisns sell them at 50 cents for
full sized packages, and any druggist from
Maine to California, if his opinion were
asked, will Bay that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablet* is the most popular and suc^ssful
remedy tor any stomach trouble.
LONDON. April 30â5 a. m.â The only
dispatch from Lord Roberts pub
lished yesterday was the usual list
of deaths and sicknesses. The Hood
of newspaper dispatches to-day de
scribing the recent operations
throws no light whatever upon the pres
ent position of affairs or upon the great
(luestion as to when the main advance is
to begin. The Standard's announcement
that General French's cavalry is return
ing to Bloemfontein is clear proof that
there is no further hope of catching the
retreating Boers, and the London papers
are beginning to display impatience at the
practical failure of the elaborate opera
tions of last week.
The Standard says: "It is dishearten
ing to find that these elaborate maneuvers
have had co small a result."
The Daily Chronicle remarks: "We are
reluctant to criticize Lord Roberts, but it
Is impossible to shut our eyes to the fact
that, during the last ten days, we have
gained very little from our enormous dis
play of force."
Without doubt, these operations have
been of a very exhausting nature and will
entail further delay. The Bloemfontein
correspondent of the Times, wriiing on
March 3, after the Paardcberg affair, de
scribes Lord Roberts' army as a "wreck,"
because it was without horses nnd with
out transport. The Bloemfontein cor
respondent of the Post speaks now of the
urgent need, at present and always, of
more horses.
Long Blames His Superiors.
The Daily Mail publishes a statement
from Colonel Long, who was blamed for
the loss of guns at Colenso, that in ad
vancing the guns as he did he merely
obeyed orders, and that the staff was
quite ignorant of the proximity of the
Boer positions.
The sudden decision of the Boer peace
delegates to go to America is attributed
to the fact that the Government of the
Netherlands, after sounding all the Euro
pean capitals, told them they had nothing
to hope for from Europe.
Colonel Dalgety's force at Wepener
numbered 1700. His losses during the
siegÂ«" were thirty killed and 149 wounded.
It is reported that there was an artillery
engagement yesterday at Karee Siding,
but no details have been received.
The Morning Post's Bloemfontein corre
spondent, in a dispatch dated Saturday,
protests against Mr. Wyndham's reply in
the House of Commons, which undertook
to disconnect the delay in Lord Roberts'
advance from the lack of horses. He
Bays:
"On the contrary, the necessity for a
large and ever increasing supply of re
mounts cannot be too urgently Insisted
on. The sacrifice of horseflesh in the
past is as nothing when compared with
the possibilities of the future. The area
across which a cavalry screen must be
thrown will necessitate 'an immense
strain, and the consequent gaps must be
filled as soon as they occur. For another
month the grass will be worth next to
nothing, and the continuous feeding of
horses on nitrogenous matter is sure to
cause lameness and kindred diseases aris
ing from hot blood.
"The Sixth. Seventh. Ninth and Elev
enth divisions will participate probably in
the direct advance. The transport of the
Sixth Division will be utilized to provide
the mounted Infantry, hut the trans
port of the Third Division will possibly
supply its place. There are rumors that
the advance will be made in many col
umns, but I don't anticipate much sub
division."
Botha's Good Generalship.
The Bloemfontein coirespondent of the
Times under Saturday's date, describing
General Botha's good generalship which
enabled the Boers to evade the Intended
cordon, says:
"General Botha arrived at Dewetsdorp
Monday and immediately detached a com
mando to oppose General French's cav
alry: We appear to have been forestalled
by Botha by just twenty-four hours. Ac
cording to the latest reports from Thaba
Nchu, the enemy is still withdrawing their
guns and wagons."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Morning Post, telegraphing Friday, says:
"From a Boer official In the commissa
riat I have been told some Interesting de
tails. The Boers had in December 60.000
men. In March they had barely 26.5f1^
having lost SOOO in killed or wounded aU
CSOQ In captured. The others are not ac
counted for. but have probably returned
to their farms. The official who gave the
information predicts that the approach of
winter will produce further wholesale
shrinkage. He says the Boers are short
of wagons, wheat and smokeless powder,
but that they have plenty of other stores
and rifle ammunition. They are not like-
Iv, however, to offer serious resistance,
as they possess no positions this side of
Pretoria that are not capable 6f being
turned by the British army. Moreover,
the Vaal River offers no protection and,
besides, is fordable every dozen miles or
so The official thinks a determined ad
vance by the British would lead the
Boers to destroy the Johannesburg mines.
Their cleverest general, he cays, is De
iarey, although Botha is a man of great
ability. None of the Boer commanders,
in his opinion, can be compared with the
late General Joubert."
Boers Again "Discouraged."
The Standard's correspondent at Bloem
fontein, telegraphing Sunday evening,
says:". ... .; - â¢- * Â¦ â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦, .
"Reports have just been received' that
the Boers are .retiring, to^the.' north .of
Ladybrand. Their horses are exhausted
and they themselves disappointed over
their failure to capture Colonel Dalgety's
position. The British cavalry, who were
pursuing the fugitive commandos, are re
turning to nioomfontein."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Standard, telegraphing Sunday, says:
"The Boers have taken every advantage
ft the mountainous nature of the country
which marks the line of their retreat to
Ladybrand. The task of driving them is
difficult and it i 3 doubtful whether they
can be reduced to submission in a district
so favorable to their tactics. I have
visited a British outpost, the one nearest
Brandfort. Tile lioers nhow the deepest
anxiety to learn the probable line of our
advance and they declare that they will
not fire a shot from Brandfort, as they
wi?h to save the town from bombardment.
The enemy are intrenched on the hills
southeast of Brandfort. but they are not
likely to make any serious stand until we
reach Kroonstad."
The Durban correspondent of the Stand
ard, tciepraphing Saturday, says:
"It is reported on goo<* authority that
the Klerksdorp commando has left Big
garsbcrg to assist in opposing the relief
column."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle, telegraphing Saturday,
says:
a cavalry reeonnolssance twenty-five
miles northeast encountered 400 Boers.
The British drove them out of a kopjo
north of Karee. Our outposts are still
harassed by moving commandos. In an
outpost affair on Thursday several Boers
were killed. The enemy will certainly
make a stand at Kroonstad. where they
have constructed miles of trenches."
CANADIANS FOUGHT
WELL AT ISRAELSPOORT
LONDON, April 29.â A special dispatch
from Thaba Nchu. dated Thursday, de
scribing the fight at Israelspoort, which is
about seven miles west of Thaba Xchu,
says:
"Three hundred Boers were recently in
trenched on two kopjes. The place of
honor was given to the Canadians, who
advanced very cleverly under their dash
ing commander. Colonel Otter. The Boors
reserved their fire until the Canadians
had reached the wire entanglements. Then
they opened with a terrific hail of bul
lets.
"The Canadians, however, had taken
good cover and were not greatly .lam
aged They were ably supported in the
assault by the Grahamstown Horse Suc
cessive rushes brought them right 'up to
the kopjes, when Colonel Otter was Vruck
twice, one ball Inflicting a nasty but not
<? igerous wound In the neck, and the
other tearing the bandages from his
shoulder. But he still cheered his men
on until the kopjes were carried. The
Boers bolted. The British losses were
twenty in killed and wounded."
A dispatch to the Daily Mail from Thaba
Ischu describing the same engagement
says:
"The British artillery shelled the kopjes
all day from three positions. The Boers
positions were extremely well chosen con.
sisting of a long range of very precipitous
hills, with narrow poorts (passes) between
commanding a vast extent of country. The
mounted infantry made a wide turning
movement, while the foot infantry ad
vnnced to within 200 yards under good
shelter.
"During the afternoon the battle became
peneral and extended over a frontage of
ten miles. The rifle. Maxim and artillery
firing was deafening. At 3 o'clock (he
Canadians advanced in open order, biit
mooting a terrific fire they took shelter in
a cor.pa. When they finally captured th*
kepje the Boers were seen retiring north
ana east with wagons, and subsequently,
v/hen the infantry made a dash, the rest
of the enemy flred a few shots and cleared
olf.
"On occupying Thaba Nchu we found
the stores and hotels looted by the Boers.
Th" natives complain of having their
horses and cattle stolen and of cruel treat
ment. The English residents were sub
jected to taunts and insults.
"I learn that yesterday Boer reinforce
rrfints from Brandfort came too late to
a.^F-st their comrades. We found a helio
erraphlc message from President Steyn to
General Botha, saying it was Inadvisable
to smd more troops to Fourteen Streams,
as the Federals were already too weak
between Bloemfontein atÂ«d Kroonstadt
am", because there were 50,000 British at
lUcrmfontein. The farmers around here
hpve all been forced, to rejoin the enemy.
Most of them have taken their sheep and
cattle along."
BOERS CONCENTRATING
AROUND LADYBRAND
BLOEMFONTEIN. April 29.â The recent
operations have tended to clear the mili
tary situation. General Pole-C-arew, pass-
Ing through the country, has brought
home to the Free Staters the fact that
the policy of leniency has been abandoned.
Besides seizing the stock of farmers, who,
after having given their submission, were
found fighting, he commandeered all the
available forage, giving receipts- for .the
same, and this will prevent the Boers
using the resources of the country.
The Boors are evidently returning in or
der to concentrate for opposing the Brit
ish advance. Now that Thaba Nchu, as
well as the approaches, is strongly held,
Ladybrand. with- the unfriendly Basutoa
lining the border, is rendered a position of
extreme danger for the Boers, the gravity
of which will be accentuated from the
moment the British advance begins.
It is understood that the Brttish.f-.will
continue to hold Thalia Nchu; owing 1 to Its
strategic .importance . and especially, with
a view of checking future raids.' The com
mandos that had recently been operating
In the direction of Thaba Nchu are znelt-

NAPA. April 29.â George H. Davidson,
son of Professor Davidson, the scientist,

Saturday afternoon by hanging himself.
The deed -was committed In the Infirmary

he had suffered from a peculiar mental
affliction and had become convinced that
he was losing his mind. To this fact is
attributed the suicide.

BISHOP HARTZELL
LAUDS THE BRITISH
NEW YORK, April 29.â Bishop Hart
zell, the missionary bishop to Africa of
the Methodist Episcopal Church in this
country, preached, this morning at St
Paul's M. E. Church. He arrived in New
York Saturday, having just returned from
a tour through West and South Africa.
Speaking of the situation in Africa Bishop
Hartzell expresses satisfaction over the
success of the three great powers, Eng
land. France and Germany in parceling
out the Dark Continent without wars re
sulting ar/iong the nations of Europe. He
said: ..
Englandâ God bless her!â the friend of mis
sions everywhere, with Germany, France and
come of the smaller powers. Is brinKlnj; the
Influence of strong, just government to bear
on regions which never knew law before. Only
recently a German official of hiph rank mur
dered his native sirl servant. He was tried
and sentenced to some punishment. The sen
tence was submitted to the Kaiser and he re
fused to sanction it because the penalty > was
not sufficiently severe. A few years ago noth
ing would ever have been done about such a
murder at all. but now the German Emperor
feels that his standing as a Christian . monarch
requires that Justice be done.
Speaking of the South African war he
said:
Don't be alarmed about that war. It Is
simply one of the Incidents In the history of
tho continent. The Boers as a people are not
fighting the British. Only a small fringe Is
disaffected. Premier Schrelner take B pride In
his loyalty to the Queen. Out of that war will
come unity. I see it clearlyâ a unity based on
prounds of mutual respect. The Boers In Cape
Colony are far better off than those of the
north, and those who are now fighting will be
far better oft when they are livlns under a
truly republican form of government, which
they don't have now.
It was announced that Bishop Hartzell
had received extensive concessions from
the British authorities in South Africa.
He said that ho believed that he had re
ceived the most extensive grant of land
for missionary purposes ever made. He
now wishes to secure $20,000 to $25,000 a
year to carry on the work.
TREVES SAYS WOMEN
NURSES ARE A PLAGUE
Special Dieoatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 29.â The World has
the following from London: Frederick
Treves, the famous surgeon who just re
turned from the war, was entertained, to
gether with Sir William MacCormac, at a
banquet at the Reform Club last night,
presided over by Lord Rosebery. Mr.
Treves took occasion to administer a
stinging rebuke to the "smart" women
suffering from Khaki fever who have
gone as alleged nurses to the front. He
said:
"So far as the sick are concerned, there
are only two plagues in South Africaâ the
plague of flies and the plague of women.
The flies we get rid of by horsehair wisps
and other appliances, and the files at least
depart at night. But the women are ab
solutely and really a terror. They came
out in the guise of amateur nurses, after
having exhausted every other form of ex
citement. Considering that we are en
gaged in a war, the number of well
dressed ladles at Cape Town and else
where giving picnics Is a blot on the cam
paign."
This onslaught on the latest fad of smart
society electrified the audience and is cer
tain to provoke bitter recriminations. But
It is known, all the same, that Mr. Treves
is perfectly Justified.
BEGBIE CHARGED WITH
ARSENAL EXPLOSION
LOJJDON, April 29â A dispatch to the
Dally Mail from Johannesburg, dated
Thursday, April 26, says:
"Personal examination at the scene of
the Begbie works disaster shows that the
foundry -was destroyed by the explosion
beyond repair, probably, this aide of the
declaration of peace, although the shell
making plant may be transferred to an
other.' foundry.
"It is said that seventeen workmen arÂ«
still unaccounted for. Mr. Begble Is
charged with murder. He is suspected by
the.Boers of having blown up his .works,
which cost $400,000, In order to revenge
himself for the affront of being. compelled
to manufacture munitions of war for the
enemy."" â¢ â¢Â¦ - - - â¢

Leaders of the Railway Employes
Give the Company Until 1 OClock
This Afternoon to Grant
Their Demands.
BUFFALO. N. V.. April 29.â The strik
ing employes Â«f the New York Central
have given the company until to-morrow
at 1 p. m. to smut th-Mr demands. If the
concessions are not n:ade'by that time it
is the inU-r.tion of 4 the strike leaders to
extend the strike, and they predict that It
will br the largest in the history of rail
roads in the Kast. They claim that all
they have to <lo is to remove tiie restraint
under which they have been holding rail
road men and that it then will run
through the entire New York Central sys
tem in the State and cripple neariy every
road entering: Buffalo.
A strike leader said to-night that he and
his followers had arranged their plans so
nicely that within twenty-four hours af
ter 1 o'clock to-morrow afternoon 30,uia)
men would join the ranks of the strikeis if
the situation seemed to demand it.
The New York Central strikers say that
they have induced others to delay action
pending a reply from the officials of the
road.
The members of the Board of Mediation
and Arbitration conceded to-day that the
situation was grave, and they did not dis
puise their belief that a great railroad
strike is imminent.
An important conference was held to
day between Commissioners Delebaoty
and Webster of the State Board of Media
tion and Arbitration and the committee of
the strikers headed by Chairman A. M.
Fish. At the request of the arbitrators
the rock-bottom term? which the men are
willing to accept from the New York Cen
tral were presented. They are identical
with the original demand, including a
general increase in wages and the re
employment of the old union men who
were discharged. In response to the ques
tion as to whether a suggestion to com
promise would be accepted, the reply was
a prompt negative, and that there would
be no settlement until the reads agreed to
a uniform scale of wages. Commissioner
Dclehanty urged that this plan be aban
doned until after an effort had been made
to adjust difficulties with th" New York
Central. To this the executive committee
agreed, and it was arran Â«d that Commis
sioner Delehanty should start for New
York at once in order to oonf<*r with iÂ«u

To-night the conductors, trainmen and
brakemt-n of the New York Central an
nounced that they would refuse to work

NINE LIVES LOST
AT PARIS FAIR
Temporary Bridge Crashes Down
Upon Sightseers*
Fatal Disaster Mars the Sabbath and
Brings Censure Upon the Heads
of Careless Officials.
PARIS, April 29.â Nine persons were
killed and a like number seriously Injured
by the collapse of a temporary bridge at
the exposition grounds to-day. The bridge
was built across an avenue at the fair
grounds, and as it was not yet completed
no one was permitted upon it but the ex
position officials neglected to guard the
lives of visitors by preventing them pass
ing underneath. The structure collapsed
under its own weight, and the timbers
went crashing down upon the throng on
the avenue below. Five persons were
killed outright. and four others died soon
after they were extricated from the ruins.
To-day's was probably the record at
tendance. Not merely the interior of the
grounds but the precincts also were
crowded, and the concourse was partic
ularly great along the Avenue de Sufren.
which forms the northern boundary of
the grounds. Here is situated a big side
show, the Celestial Globe. A footbridge,
on which the finishing touches were being
put to-day, crosses the Avenue de Sufren,
connecting the side show with the exhi
bition It was constructed of wood, with
a stucco facade and with i plaster-made
tower at each end.
Strangely enough, the bridge had been
condemned only this morning. The public
was therefore not allowed to go upon the
structure, and in this way a disaster even
more terrible than that which occurred
was averted.
Crashes Down Upon the Crowd.
The pay crowd was passing along the
avenue and some hundred or more persons
were walking beneath the bridge, when
suddenly an ominous crash was heard.
Before those underneath could turn aside
the structure fell with a fearful crash,
burying nearly fifty.
A shout of horror arose from the spec
tators and mingled with the cries of the
victims. For a moment nothing could be
distinguished but a cloud of dust and plas
ter. A scene of the greatest excitement
and confusion followed. But this was only
for a few seconds. Almost immediately
the crowd attacked the debris in an effort
to release those lying beneath.
The workmen within the grounds who
had witnessed the accident, the police and
the Republican Guards, together with
quite a number of soldiers, joined in the
rescue work. The promenaders forgot
their Sunday attire and covered them
selves with dirt and grime in tearing;
away the rubbish with their hands. Wood- ;
en beams and poles were brought from thÂ© j
half-finished buildings near by and were
used as levers to raise the fallen mass.
The victims first recovered were mostly
I only injured, the dead being found later
beneath the center of the structure.
Messengers were dispatched to bring
firemen and sappers, with their equip
ments, and the first body was found after
! a quarter of an hour's frantic labor. It
j was that of a little girl about 7 years old,
| whose head was horribly crushed. Victim
! after victim was brought to light until a
I row of six mutilated corpses had been
j placed upon the sidewalk and a dozen
I other persona, some badly and others less
1 seriously injured, had been carried in am
bulances or driven to the hospitals.
A family composed of father, mother
and two girls narrowly escaped destruc
tion. The parents, who happened to be a
little ahead, had gone under the bridge,
the children following Just at the moment
of the collapse. The parents were killed,
but the children sprang back and escaped
with a few scratches. A cyclist's wheel
was smashed, but himself escaped unhurt.
The dead are five men, three women and
one child. The weighty plaster towers
seem to have been responsible for the fall ,
of the structure.
Relief Work at Once Begun.
Commissioner General Plckard and other
high officials of the exposition arrived
shortly after the accident and superin
tended the work of relief. President Lou
bet sent an officer of his household for In
formation. Several soldiers were among
the injured and many of their comrades
were foremost in giving assistance".
The disaster was the leading topic of
discussion in the cafes and at the other
Paris resorts this evening, and strong
criticism was leveled against the exposi
tion authorities for having allowed an un
finished structure to be used, fears being
expressed that the incomplete state of the
works within the exposition grounds
themselves might lead to a similar acci
dent. It should be said, however, that the
exhibition authorities were not responsi
ble for the defective construction of the
footbridge, which was erected by the man
agement of the Celestial Globe.
As a result of the accident M. Lepine,
Prefect of Police, has ordered the closing
of several side shows, the structural ar
rangements of which are considered dan
gerous.
Several of the morning papers pro
nounce severe criticisms upon the care
lessness of exposition officials. The Matin
says: "Those who dt-n't think of prevent
ing the public from passing under a card
board bridge after themselves having
recognized It as unsafe, and those who
have opened attractions to visitors which
are not protected against fire, are guilty
of crime."

Founder of Roberts College
Favors Coercion of the

Believes That the Dispatching of a
Few Warships to the Bosphorous
Would Bring the Porte
to Time.
Â»
Bpecia' Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 29.â Rev. Cyrus Hamlin.
the founder of Roberts College, told The
Call correspondent to-night that he fa
vored the sending of American warships
to Turkey to enforce the payment of the
indemnity for the rebuilding of the col
lege. He said:
"The Sublime Porte has had little fear
of the United States because the United
States has not insisted that her interests
be protected. Now that this Government
is asserting itself there seems to be more
hope for tne protection of American in
terests and for respect for American Con
suls, but hitherto the Sultan has done
Just about as he pleased without respect
for the wishes of this nation. What this
country ought to do Is to draw a few
stanch war vessels up before the city of
Constantinople and allow her diplomacy
to take the form of a mild insinuation that
there is plenty of shot and shell still un
expended in the holds of the United
States cruisers and battleships. The dem
onstration in front of Constantinople is
worth more than diplomacy. It would
not take the Sultan long to pay then."
Rev. Mr. Hamlin received a letter from
a former Secretary of State saying that
It would be impossible for this country to
demand indemnity and force its payment,
because of the distance of Turkey from
this country
"This has been the great trouble in the
past, and one which is now being over
come by the firm stand taken by this na
tion," he said.
PORTE HAS NOT REPUTED.
Situation as Regards the American
Claims Unchanged.
CONSTANTINOPLE, April 23.â The
Porte has not yet replied to the note
handed to Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish For
eign Minister, by the Uhitod States Charge
d'Affaires, Lloyd Griscom. regarding the
indemnity claim, and the situation is un
changed. It is believed In some quarters
that a settlement will yet be made by
means of some arrangement with private
American contractors, concealing the act
ual payment and thus relieving the Otto
man Government from admitting respon
sibility for the losses occasioned at the
time of the massacre.
the proprieties, the builders of the arches
have followed the classic lines
of the Capitol, so that instead
of cheapening the appearance of
that edifice the series of arches and long
rows of festooned columns tend to its
greater adornment. The only thought
which depresses the carnival promoters
to-night is that at this inopportune time
It may rain.
A sky which for weeks has revealed the
clearest blue this afternoon became cloud
ed, and to-night at 7:30 o'clock a light
shower fell. However, It soon subsided,
and the sky at 9 o'clock was once again
bright and clear. Every train Into Sacra
mento to-day brought its quota of visitors,
and it is expected that people will begin
to pour in by thousands to-morrow and
Tuesday, when the floral festival is to oc
cur. The indications are that to-morrow
will mark the beginning of a season of
warm weather, and the young women of
Sacramento will be enabled to appear in
the light dresses which for days they
have had in preparation for the approach
ing event. Sacramento will show off its
wealth of feminine and floral beauty on
Tuesday, and the parade promises to be of
remarkable splendor.
The whole town to-night is wrapped m
red and yellow, and the electric cars have
all they can do to transport the incoming
crowds to. the hotels and other places of

Measure Will Pass the House

Bepublican Leaders in the Upper
Branch of Congrecn Decide to
â¢Eliminate It From the
Programme.
Â»
Special Dispatch to Tts Call.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. Arrii 2Â» â
When the vote Is taken In the House of
Representatives on Wednesday on the
Nicaraguan canal bill it will be passed
practically unanimously, but It will go no
further during the present session, as the
Republican leaders in the Senate have
definitely determined that it shall not be
put on the legislative programme of the
Senate for this session.
Though there will be little if any oppo
sition to the bill on the final vote in Hie
House of Representatives, a determined
effort will be made to amend it still fur*
ther than is proposed by the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
The amendments striking out direct au
thority for the fortification of the canal
do not so as far ns .some frlenOs of the
administration and of the Hay-Paunce
fote treaty would like. They will try to
secure still further modifications of the
bill along the line of guaranteeing the
absolute neutrality of the canal in war
as well as in pea<-e. Efforts will l>e made
also to modify the Nicarapruan route. It
will he urged that in view of the fact
that the Walker Commission is making a
careful study of the Panama rout", as
well as the Nicaraguan route. It would
be advisable to give the President discre
tion between the two routes, so as to en
able him to finally adopt that one whh h
is found by the commission to be the most
advantageous, and also to enable him to
obtain better terms from the Government
of the country or countries through which
the canal will run. It will he pohueri out
that if the Government be free to select
either route the Nicaraguan Government
probably would place few^r obstacles in
the way or granting all that will be de
sired than Irthe President were bound in
advance to construct the canal by the
Nicaraguan route.

TRANS-ATLANTIC TRAVELERS
Furnished Special -Ittendants by the
Pennsylvania System.
The bureau of attendants for trans-Atlantic
travelers established in Jersey City and New
York City twenty years ago by the Pennsyl-
vania System. ha 3 proven a great convenience
to persons making European trips and to
tourists arriving in America at that port. It
will be particularly convenient for visitors to
the Paris Exposition because the departure
docks of most of the Atlantic Steamship Lines
are convenient to the new Jersey City Passen-
ger Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company.
This bureau consists of experienced agents
whose duties are to meet passengers arriving
In Jersey City and New York over the Penn-
sylvania Lines and assist them in arranging
for trans-Atlantic trips via any of the steam-
ehlp lines by conducting them to steamships
and aiding In preparations for a trip abroad.
These agents will provide cabs operated by
the Pennsylvania System and aid passengers
with their baggage. They are fully posted on
matters pertaining to steamships leaving New
York, and arrangements can be made through
them lor procuring steamship tickets in ad-
vance.
They also meet incoming steamships to aid
travelers in shaping details for continuing
Journeys from New York over the Pennsyl-
vania Lines by furnlFhlni; tickets, arranging
for the transfer of baggage from steamship
docks after it has been passed by customs in-
spectors, and having the same checked through
to destination. They will reserve sleeping car
accommodations and relieve persons of â¢ the
foregoing details, making themselves useful as
attendants and guides free of charge.

Taylor returned here from Washinffton
and spent Sunday at the executive man

were aware of his presence in the city
till this evening, when he appeared at the
railroad station and boarded a train for
Louisville. The local officers and those in
charge of the prosecution knew that Gov
ernor Taylor was here, and the fact that
a warrant of arrest was not served upon
him Is now construed to mean that the

Overworked Nerves
and wasting vitality make their pres-
ence known through headaches, dizzi-
ness, inability to sleep, loss oi appetite
and a general run-down condition of
the system. These signs are sometimes
accompanied by neuralgia, hysteria,
rheumatism or nervous prostration
in some other form. To remove these
troubles, cure the nerves. They need
feeding, strengthening and building up
and nothing will do this so quickly and
so surely as Dr. Miles' Nervine. This
truly remarkable medicine is gaining
hundreds of new friends every day.
Here is a surveyor from Decatur, Ind.,
Mr. G. E. McKean. who writes:
"A chronic stomach trouble, which
my physician was unable to overcome,
so wore on my nervous system that I
broke down with nervous prostration.
I could r.ot sleep day or night except in
fitful naps: could scarcely eat any kind
of food and wasted away to a mere
shadow. After spending over $50000
in a vain search for relief I was pre-
vailed upon to try Dr. Miles' Nervine.
Relief came immediately. I took six
bottles and to-day am a well man."

VANCOrVEIt. April Â».â The steamer
fCew England of the halilmt fishing fleet
a:ri\"d this mnrniiiK from the north with
the news of the finding of an unknown
thrco-mnsted schooner in a secluded bay

who evidently had been sailors on the ili-
Jated schooner.
The bows and forward deck have been
practically broken off and part of the
stern ha.s been smashed, so that the name

OUR MAY DAY FESTIVAL.
WITH a degree of enthusiasm and an extent of
preparation that assure a brilliant success, the
teachers and the school children have ar
ranged for a May day festival at Glen Park which will
be memorable in our annals. It is to be moreover
something more than a festival, for the profits realized
by it are to be devoted to the teachers' annuity fund
and will thus be of lasting benefit to the community.
From day to day The Call has noted the various
steps taken toward preparing for the event and has
described the salient features of the attractive pro
gramme of entertainment provided. The subject is
one in which the whole population of the city may
rightly take an interest, for there are few families
that have not in some way close relations with the
schools and the teachers. By reason of that interest and
the excellence of the object for which the festival is
designed, a liberal patronage of the fete may be ex
pected.
No class of those who serve the public is deserving
of more cordial sympathy and assistance in all
undertakings than are the teachers of the public
schools. It is due to the efforts of these men and
women that our system of public instruction has be
come an institution of which the whole community
can be and is justly proud. The desire to establish
an annuity fund is a laudable one, and any well directed
effort to that end deserves the cordial co-operation
of the people. *
'Whether the profits in the way of money be large
or small, we are at any rate to have a May day festival
which will revive the joy of the old times when the day
was "the maddest and merriest of all the bright new
year." It will furnish the city with a holiday such as
is rarely enjoyed in any part of the United States,
and all of our people and the visitors within our gates
will be sure of a joyous day if they spend it at
Glen Park.

PUT AN END TO DELAY.
WITH an approach to absolute certainty it can
be foretold that when the Supervisors to-day
take up the order prohibiting the telephone
company from exacting a nickel from the patrons of
the telephone slot machines before giving the desired
switch, they will be met by a request for further post
ponement and that if the request be not granted the
telephone men will then fight for postponement and
every form of tactics that tends to delay will be made
use of.
That much being a foregone conclusion, it be
hooves the Supervisors to bear in mind that there has
been already a very long'delay in enacting the*regula
tions necessary to protect the public from the exac
tions of the telephone corporation and to compel the
corporation to pay its just share of the burdens of
'taxation. The license tax question seems to be satis
factorily settled by the discovery of Supervisor Mc-
Carthy that an ordinance already in existence is ap
plicable to the telephone slot machines and that noth
ing more is needed than to enforce it. That issue
then may be left to the Tax Collector and the courts,
but the other issue remains. It is for the Supervisors
to decide to-day whether or not the public is to be
left without redress from the petty swindling the cor
poration practices in the operation of its slot
machines.
Months have passed since this fight for justice be
gan. The present Board of Supervisors in fact re
ceived the contest as an inheritance from the preced
ing board. Week after week and month after month
the corporation has had the subject postponed. Dila
tory tactics of one kind have been abandoned only to
give way to dilatory tactics of another kind, and delay
has followed delay so that up to this time nothing has
been done. It is evidently the expectation of the
company that these continuous delays will weary the
public and tire out popular interest in the matter.
Up to this time, however, the repeated postponements
have had no other effect than that of increasing the
iiritation of the people and strengthening the public
demand for justice. Now let the board act. There
has been delay enough. The ordinance should be en
acted to-day.
THE EXILE OF CRONJE.
THE impounding of General Cronje on St.
Helena Is a political mistake. It increases the
feeling and friction against England. The be
lief is general that it is not justified by either mili
tary reasons or reasons of state. Cronje was doing
his duty in a public way in such a war as the laws of
n;A'ons recognize. He was not an outlaw. He was
a public combatant, with all the rights of a combat
ant. We believe it is not yet settled that a nation cap
turing such a combatant can do with him as it pleases.
The case of Bonaparte is not a precedent. The
Emperor was an assenting party to his own banish
ment to Elba. The allies stipulated that he should
retain royal state and be the sovereign of Elba, with
retinue and revenue becoming his station and the
great part he had played in affairs. He violated the
stipulations to which he had assented and when he
again became a prisoner, after the hundred days' cam
paign, he was exiled to St. Helena. But Cronje was
not the breaker of any treaty. He was doing his duty
in fair war and to send him into unwholesome exile is,
at his time of life, almost the equivalent of sending
him to death. The climate of St. Helena was very
bad for Napoleon. It will be worse for the Boer
patriot. The Emperor had spent most of his life near
sea level. Cronje has spent his far above sea level, on
the high veldts. We take it as conceded that Lord
Roberts had no right to receive Cronje as a military
prisoner and order him to be shot. This being so,
England has no right, based on moral or military rea
sons, or in her own safety, to send him into exile
where the poisonous climate will kill him as surely as
would the bullets of a firing squad.
These be days of boasting about civilization. Great
Britain professes to be in South Africa on an errand
of civilization. But is it a sign of civilization to take
a military prisoner, whose force in men and guns was
outnumbered more than. ten to one, and deport him
beyond seas to an island, horrible in its physical fea
tures and repulsive in its history?
England has done a great deal of exiling, She has
sent Irish patriots to penal colonies to consort with
sheepstealers and manslayers. She has sent royal
personages, like the King of Delhi, and revolu
tionists, like Arabi Pasha, into perpetual banishment,
under armed guards^ using for their prisons islands
she had stolen from them or some one else.
Now she expects to strike terror to the Boers by
punishing a manly foe. caught in open war, with ban
ishment and perpetual exile. Maybe the policy will
work and her enemies will be deterred by the exhibi
tion of barbarity, but that does not justify the act nor
bleach the stain it puts upon English honor.
If England had been in our place at the close of
the civil war Jefferson Davis and the leaders of the
rebellion would have been tried by court-martial and
shot or would have been sent to some tropical island
to desiccate and die. That is the British idea of civili
zation. ,
Our way was different. Mr. Davis and the leaders
of the Confederacy were but little disturbed and lived
for years in the enjoyment of peace and prosperity un
der the Government they had attempted to destroy.
Our example should impress England with the im
policy of her conduct toward Cronje. It is not for
gotten that the English people frantically denounced
the French republic for exiling Dreyfus to Devil's
Island. But Dreyfus was not a prisoner of war. He
was accused and convicted of betraying military
secrets. Hard as his punishment was, it was justified
if he were guilty.
After the denunciations of France it: that case,
which made the air of Great Britain lurid, what excuse
can be given for exiling Cronje to an island as un
wholesome as the prison of Dreyfus, when he is
guilty of no offense except the brave and soldierly de
fense of his country?
. Last October, following close upon the beginning
of the war, several English writers declared that
Presidents Krugcr and Steyn and General Joubert
would be kept as perpetual prisoners by England if
they were captured and would be sent into exile.
This brutal programme excited no attention at the
time, but now it seems to have been the prospectus of
an actual policy.
It will cost England dearly to guard such prisoners
on any of her islands. The world's patriotic spirit of
adventure will raise up friends and fleets for the res
cue of the Dutch patriots. It will not be the case of
Napoleon over again. These Boers have not broken
the world's peace. They were minding their own
business when the invader and aggressor came to break
their peace and it is hard to hold such men prisoners
when in the opinion of mankind they should be free.
The fire at Ottawa was big enough to warm the
heart of charity on both sides of the ocean and in a
comparatively short time the suffering will be largely
relieved. That is one of the advantages which rail
ways and telegraphs have conferred upon the world.
They enable help to come promptly when help is
needed.
Now that the Oakland police have captured the
lone footpad our own detectives can lay aside their
masquerade costumes and see if they cannot capture

SOCRAMENTO IN GLORY.
,\^ AY will be met with a frolic welcome in all
/ \ parts of California this year, for it is a time of
* * prosperity and all hearts are ready for holi
days and festivals, but the center of the joy of the
May is to be at Sacramento, where preparations have
been made for a whole week of gala days with some
particular novelty of entertainment to. give a special
charm to each successive day.
According to reports the celebration is to be one
of the most attractive outdoor festivals ever given,
even in California, where for years past similar fetes
have been conducted on a scale of such magnitude as
to attract the attention of the whole Union. The
grounds of the Capitol and the streets surrounding
them are to be radiant with the brightness of flowers
and banners arranged in a thousand forms of decora
tion and all other parts of the city arc to be arrayed
in harmony with that central feature of the display. It
is to be a holiday for all classes and all sorts and
conditions of people and Sacramento's hospitality ex
tends a welcome to every visitor who comes to share
in it.
It is right and fitting that these festivals should be
held and we can never have too many of them. Cali
fornia is by nature adapted to be the holiday ground
of the cultured pleasure-seekers of this continent.
Our soil is so profuse of fruits and flowers and our
climate so balmy that the joy of living is to be found
here in a nearer approach to perfection than any
where else in the world. That fact has brought to the
State a large number of people of wealth and culture
to make their homes here, but the number is not so
large as it should be, solely because the attractiveness
of the State is not yet fully made known. Every 'ex
tensive and elaborate fair and festival given under cir
cumstances that excite widespread interest and pub
lication is therefore a benefit to the whole common-

THE CALL FOR ORGANIZATION.
rROM the proceedings of the convention of the
State League of Republican Clubs at Los Ange
les the party will derive a stimulus toward united
and vigorous activity in preparation for the coming
campaign. The election of Alden Anderson to the
presidency of the league will be received with satisfac
tion everywhere. It places at the head of the league a
man young indeed, but well tried in positions of politi
cal responsibility and of a high capacity for leadership.
As Speaker of the Assembly Mr. Anderson realized
the old saying of the right man in the right place,
and his record in that office, justifies confidence that
in his new position his services will be equally creo
itable to himself and useful to his party.
The resolutions adopted by the league rightly em
phasize the importance of organization for cam
paign work. They declare:
"Republican clubs and organizations should be re
quested to appoint special committees who shall bo
charged with the duty of calling upon and urging all
Republicans to immediately register for the coming
election, as the law now requires that there must be an
entirely new registration in every county of the State.
Under the primary election law, primary elections
will be held in every county on the 2d of August next
for the election of delegates to the State convention
to nominate Presidential Electors, district conventions
to nominate Representatives in Congress and local
conventions to nominate judicial officers and Sena
tors, in the odd-numbered districts, and members of
the Assembly. Every effort should be made by all
Republican organizations to take all necessary meas
ures to thoroughly educate the voter on the pro
visions of the law, which gives him every opportunity
to exercise his choice freely for delegates for conven
tions nominating candidates for public office. We
would most earnestly urge upon the attention of the
League of Republican Clubs, as well as upon the Re
publican party at large, the supreme importance of
complete organization in order that we may present
a united front to the enemy in the coming Presidential
campaign. Organization is the key to success. We
have no time to lose. The first gun in the impending
conflict has already been fired. Action should be the
watchword of every patriotic citizen."
These recommendations will, we trust, be heeded
and acted upon by the leaders and the workers of the
party throughout the State. Organization is. in fact,
the main duty of Republicans at this time. If that be
accomplished victory will be assured. If it be
neglected there will be serious danger of defeat.
The importance of organization has been impressed
upon the party by its national leaders who, from the
vantage ground of Washington; have studied the
whole political situation and have perceived what is
necessary to assure success. "Organize, organize,
organize," is the counsel that comes to us from every
State where conventions have been held. In Cali
fornia, where the strength of the opposing parties is
nearly equal and where the independent vote fre
quently determines results, it is even more necessary
than elsewhere that the organization of the party
should be made so perfect as to be able to bring to
the polls the full Republican vote. The Los Angeles
convention has set forth clearly the work of the day.
Let it be undertaken at once.

As the committee was unanimous in ar

ought the Senate to be unanimous in pass

Dignity of the Senate and the political
well-being of the country require the ex

The undisputed facts in the case of Sen

justify the refusal of the Senate to give

sequence whether the disputed charges
agiinst him can be proven or not.

Senator Clark of Montana has been de
clared a briber by a committee of the

committee, who deserve the thanks of
the people of thiscountry, also recommend
in their report that the seat of the Mon

be more wholesome than such a rebuke to

at the foundation of our government. The
Senate apparently is beginning to realize
that the fundamental principles of our
Government must be respected and hon

government society, law and order mast

out allowing the gossips time fu ly to dis
cuss the findings in the Clark investiga

to the Quay case, and has refused to seat
the Pennsylvania Senator by a vote of 33

as they are, must be welcomed by all
those who. while they ardently desire
good government, have begun to despair
of its consummation.

By the close vote of 33 to 32 the Senate
has decided not to seat Matthew Stanley
Quay; but, narrow as was the escape, the
country can but feel a sense of relief at
the outcome.

The seating of Quay would have been a
reversal by the Senate of its former actJon
in similar cases, and thus would have
been a conspicuous case of self-stultifica

that that august body was saved from it

vote. m m t

The defeat of Quay is a national victory
over the most odious and unscrupulous
attempt ever made to break in to the
United States Senate by a fraudulent title
through appeals to every influence known
to a desperate and powerful political
trickster. May Quay's fate be that of all
who seek to drag the Senate down to the
level of their own evil ambitions and de

Salt Lake Herald.
Matthew Stanley Quay was refused a
seat in the Senate of the United States
yesterday and the precedents established
by that body were upheld. Gubernatorial
appointments are not eligible when Legis
latures fail to elect. This is the verdict
and it is a just one. To give the executive
the power assumed by Governor Stone
would result in greater evils than now
exist in Senatorial elections. It would en
courage Governors to promote deadlocks
in State Legislatures that their personal
selections might be named.

Los Angeles Express.
The effect of the course followed by the
Senate will be salutary upon the country
at large. It blocks the game of designing
politicians in the future, of whatever
party, and bars the way of men who
would be willing to throw principle to th*
winds if they could by so doing slip Into
the United States Senate by the back
fence. While the majority against Mr.
Quay was small, still in view. of the situa

The refusal of the Senate to seat Quay
of Pennsylvania is in accord with Its ac
tion in like cases in the past, and though
the decision against him was reached by
a majority of but one vote, it is likely to
establish a positive precedent which will
be adhered to henceforth. Quay is no loss
to the Senate. He has a shockingly bad
record and the rottenness of Pennsylvania
politics was long exemplified in the fact
that a man so notorious for misconduct
represented that great State in the Senate

itself on record, by a vote of 33 to 32 in the
Quay case, against seating Senators ap
pointed by Governors in cases where the
State Legislatures have met and failed to
elect. Although there was much opposi
tion from Pennsylvania to the seating of
Mr. Quay on the appointment of Governor
Stone after he had failed to secure an
election by the Legislature of the State,
yet the question that the Senate had to
settle wasâ or should have been consid
eredâa constitutional and not a personal
one. The Senate's decision of the question
Is not so positive and final as It would
have been had the vote upon It not been
almost equally divided.
boys in some of the principal navies
ranges as follows: In the United States
navy the Secretary's estimate for the
present year provided for 10.000 men and
boys with a total pay of $6,750,000, giving
an average of $Â»375; GreaÂ» Britain's en
listed force, numbering 110,?00, costs J4S.
400,000, averaging $437 45; France, with 42.

an average of $345 66 per man, while Rus
sia's enlisted naval force of 35,000 men re
ceives only a total of $2,153,500, giving the
low average of $C 1 53.
The Norwegian coast-defense vessel
Xorge was launched March 31 at the E!*
wick yard. The vessel la somewhat of Iho
high freeboard monitor type, 21)0 feet In
length, 50Vâ¢ feet beam and 16^-j feet
draught, displacing 3550 tons. Upon this
comparatively small displacement the
vessel carries a 6-lnch Ilarveyized armor
belt, its four casemates are of 5-lnch
nickel steel and the two barbettes are of
6-inch nickel steel. The armament con
sists of two 6.0-inch and six 4.9-inch guns,
all quick firers, besides eight 12-pounder*.
six 3-pounders and two torpedo tubes.
The engines are of 45d) horsepower, guar
anteed to give a speed of sixteen and a
half knots. A duplicate to the Norge is
on the stocks at Elswick.
The discontent of the engineer students
at Keyham Is on the Increase, as their
treatment is In marked contrast with that
extended to the naval cadats on board tho
Britannia. There is but slight encour
agement for engineers to enter the Brit
ish navy, for promotion Is slow, the pay
is low and they appear to be barely tol
erated by the quarterdeck -officers. It
costs only $130 a year to educate a naval
engineer at Keyham, while the expense
is $2000 for each naval cadet. The mili
tary value of the British navy engineer
is forcibly Indicated by the fact that out
of 910 engineer officers only 14 hold th.>
relative rank of captain, a ratio of one
to sixty-five, while in the line corps of
1940 officers there are 73 admirals and l'j-i
captains, a ratio nearly seven times great
er than in the engineer corps. In the
United States navy, prior to the amalga
mation of the engineer corps with that of
the line, there were ISO of the former, of
which 11 held the relative rank of cap
tain, or at the rate of one captain to IÂ»>4
engineers. In the line there were 62 offi
cers above the grade of commanders out
of a total of 70-1. giving a ratio of 1 to
11.4. The disparity between the corps in
the two services was therefore much lesa
in ours than in the British navy.
TRADE IN FAIR SHAPE.
THE business situation did not change material
ly during the past week. There was the samt
hesitation in certain lines, but it was no more
pronounced than a fortnight ago, and, in fact, some
improvement in the retail trade is reported here and
there. There was a decline of $20 per ton in some
descriptions of wire goods and the iron trade showed
weakness in other directions, but there were no de
preciations of any consequence in other staples.
Trade is not really dull, but it appears so in contrast
with the abnormal activity of last year, when every
thing was booming at highwater mark. A few months
ago the volume of business had grown to such pro
portions that an increase in the currency was deemed
indispensable in order to carry it on and to this end
the recent financial bill was brought before Congress.
The bill was duly passed, the circulation has been in
creased, but it is now found that the tables are turned
and that whereas a year ago we had more business
than money, we now have more money than business.
In other words, while we have increased the currency
the volume of trade has suddenly dropped off. Xor
is this all. The present volume of trade is not suf
ficient to maintain the high prices of last year and
they are gradually falling back. As pointed out sev
eral times in this column, prices have got too high
for the public purse and the purchasing limit of the
people has at last been reached.
Still, there is no real lassitude in the commercial
bod}-. In spite of the luil in the iron and steel trade,
which may prove momentary, an" improved demand
for pigiron for export is noted and heavy purchases
for this account have been made in the Southern
States. This may lead to a general revival in this im
portant branch. Lumber, however, continues dis
appointing and some descriptions are weakening un
der a decreased demand, due largely to labor troubles
in the building trades. Woolen goods and boots and
shoes are dull and easy and none of the important
staples show much animation, though, on the other
hand, none exhibit any real depression.
The unfavorable happenings in the American Steel
and Wire Company have scared the public out of
Wall street, which is now 'abandoned to the profes
sionals. London, too, is looking cross-eyed at Amer
ican industrial stocks, hence the street is dull all
around.
The situation on this coast shows some change.
Frosts and cold weather in Oregon and Washington
and drying north winds in California have somewhat
altered the crop prospects and the enormous crops cf
grain and fruit expected a few weeks ago are no
longer figured on. The yield of both, as far as can
be seen at present, will be good and the aggregate
fruit crop, according to the inquiries of the Weather
Bureau, will be about the same as last year. General
merchandise is reported in steady movement, though
some lines, notably provisions, hides, wool and dried
fruit, are dull. Money is in ample supply at the
regular rates and collections are average. California
bids fair to have a prosperous year, but not like IS99 â
such years come only once in a century.

wealth and merits a liberal patronage from all parts
of the State.
It is safe to say that all who visit Sacramento
this week will have a joyous holiday and de
rive from it a memory that will be a pleasure
to recall for years to come. The capital city is
accustomed to the hospitable task of receiving
and entertaining visitors on a large scale. The gather
ings at the State fairs and at the sessions of the Legis
lature provide the people of the city every year with
occasions for the exercise of the faculty of welcoming
all comers with a hearty goodwill and providing them
with ample accommodations and entertainment, and
consequently the crowds that attend this fair will find
everything made pleasant for them from the. time they
reach the city until they leave. To those who can af
ford a holiday the opportunity thus afforded should
not be neglected. See Sacramento and have a
halcyon time.

OPENING OF
THE RUSH TO
CAPE NOME
Â¦
Steamer Jeanie Will Be
Laden With Passengers
and Freight.
Thousands of People Waiting for Ac
coxnodations and but Few Tick- ,
ets Are Unsold for Vessels
Sailing in May.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 29.-The formal
rush to the gold fields of Cape Nome will
be Inaugurated to-morrow, when the
steamer Jeanle of the Pacific Steam Whal
ing Company, the first steamer to start
on the trip this year, is scheduled to sail,
providing she arrives in the meantime
from San Francisco. This vessel will take
eighty passengers and 400 tons of freight
from this port, and expects to be one of
the first to reach Nome when the ob
structing ice has broken up.
For the past several weeks people have
been arriving here by the hundreds to get
ready to mahe the northward trip, and
have filled all the hotels to such an extent
that it has been difficult for transient
travelers to get accommodations. The
steamship offices have been crowded with
applicants for berths and freight room,
and many of the companies have been re
fusing passengers for several weeks. It is
conservatively stated that there are no
more than 200 tickets available on all the
steamers that are scheduled to leave here
In May, and most of the freight room has
been sold. This means that all those wish-
Ing to go to Nome, except those who se
cure the few bertha left, must wait until
the June sailings, unless they embark on
sailing craft, which are leaving this port
at the rate of two a day and have been
doing so for the last week.
Twenty-five steamships are scheduled to
leave here for Nome in May, two prom
ising to get away tne Ist, seven on the
10th, three on the 15th, one on the 17th,
two on the ISth, live on the 20th, one on
the 24th, two on the 25th, one on the 30th
and one on the 31st. The vessels to sail
on the 20th have booked 1675 passengers
and 4300 tons of general merchandise. This
will probably be the liveliest day of the
year, as several vessels will also leave
that day for Skaguay.
The most conservative estimates of the
traffic to Nome this year, based on actual
returns, show that ISli persons have al
ready engaged passage for the first sail
ings of the twenty-five steamships, and
that these vessels have already contracted
for 25,250 tons of merchandise in their car
goes. Taking the average charge of $90
per passenger and $40 a ton for freight
and It is seen that the steamships will
get a total gross revenue during the next
month of $1,561,300. The operators of four
teen of the vessels state that they intend
to make four trips each to Nome during
the season, live will make throe trip 3 each
and the remaining six one trip each. The
net registered tonnage of the steamers to
sail next month is 25.625 tons, or a quarter
of the entire tonnage departing for Alaska
last year. The value of the freight booked
tor the May sailings, estimated at, sloo a
ton. which is a conservative figure, will
be $2,562,500.

Charged With Vagrancy.
The opening of Glen Park yesterday af
forded the bunko steerers an opportunity
to ply their trade, but their operations
were cut short by the prompt action of
Captain Glllin of the Seventeenth-street
police station. With the arrival of the
improvement clubs at the park came also
about a dozen of the sure-thing frater
nity, among them being Edward Gray
and James Wilson, known to the police aa
the "Golden brothers." They were recog
nized by Detectives Fitzgerald and Gra
ham and Sergeant Shaw, and Captain Gll
lcn ordered their immediately arrest on
the charge of vagrancy. A dozen more of
the fraternity were brought before Cap
tain GUlen, who informed them that their
absence would be appreciated. They left
on the first city-bound car. Gray and
Wilson were balled out.

ating with them are a large number of

The summit of Mount Brandon, where
the Shaws are defying the county, is cov
ered with snow. This circumstance has
interfered seriously with the work of the
dogs. Late yesterday afternoon a pack
picked up the traril and were leading
straight up through a ravine when a
patch of melting snow and water In the
bed of a brook confused the dogs, and no
amount of urging could induce them to re
sumo the chase.
The crowd began to gather last Friday,
a few hours after the shooting of the
deputy sheriff. All through that day, yes
terday and to-day the man hunt has been
continued with Increasing vigor. The
search to-day almost nroved the death of
Sheriff Chapman of Woodstock, who was
thrown from his horse during a mad
scramble down a ravine, and was badly
hurt about the head and shoulders.

SHAWS STILL SAFE
IN THE MOUNTAINS
Hounds Thrown Off the Trail by the
Presence of Quantities of Half-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 29.â For the third time
since the man hunt in Vermont began,
last Friday, the bloodhounds and the
hunters were to-day baffled by Dunston
and Frank Shaw, the father and son, who
escaped from the county jail near Pitts
field. Late to-night, after one of, the most
exciting days in the police annals of New
England. Sheriff Thaddeus M. Chapman
admitted that the chances for the capture
of the Shaws in this Slate are slight, and
it is probable that they will make their
way into New York State. All the law
officers and almost all the able-bodied
male population of Stockbridge. Wood
stock and Middlebury have joined in the
grim sport. The father and son for whose
blood hundreds of baying clogs are thirst

by a number of impassable ravines. All
about the base of the mountain is a cor

B'NAI B'RITH GRAND
LODGE IN SESSION
Sixteen Proxy Delegates Denied the
Bight to Vote in the Con
vention.
CHICAGO, April 20.â Sixteen delegates
to the seventh general convention of the
Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of
B'nai B'rith. which held its first session
at the Auditorium to-day, were denied
the right to vote in the deliberations of
that body,' though the privilege of the
floor was given to them. .The decision
was arrived at after a spirited discussion
of the question, after the committee on
credentials reported that the delegates
representing the lodges in Germany, Kou
mania and Austria had not been regularly
elected an was required by the constitu
tion of the organization. The majority of
tho delegates.were proxy representatives.
All the delegates who have been prevent
ed from voting are from the Lnlted
States, some of them living in Denvei
und San Francisco. It appears that there
were no delegates appointed to the pre.se
ent convention by the lodges in the iÂ«t
tign countries named, with the exception
of oneâ Siesrmund Borgel of Berlinâ and
proxy delegates were selected from the
lodge's In this country without the formal
ity of an election.
Victor Abraham of Cincinnati was elect
ed chairman. Among the vice presidents
named was Jacob Greenebaum of San
Francisco. A message from the president
of the executive committee, Julius Bien,
dwelt at length on the past work of the
organization. The convention will revise
the laws and pass legislation for the va
rious subordinate lodges. President Bien
occupied the chair.
FOOTPADS AT WORK
IN SAN RAFAEL
Nathan Strauss Attacked and Bobbed
by Two Masked Men on Mis
sion Street.
Special Dieratch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 20.â Nathan
Strauss, a prominent young society man
of this place, had an exciting adventure
with footpads last evening, which, but for
his presence of mind, might have resulted
kiore seriously than it did.
Strauss was on his way to his home on
Mission street and was within a block of
his house when two masked men stepped
from behind a tree and called on him to
throw up his hands. Instead of obeying
Strauss gave one of the men a stiff uper
cut He was outmatched, however, for
the footpad struck him a violent blow on
the back of the head, knocking him down.
Strauss did not come to himself till some
hours later, when he found his money
gone and a severe contusion on the back
of his scalp. No clew has yet been ob
tained to the cowardly assailants of
Strauss, but the authorities are hopeful
of apprehending the miscreants In a few
days.
FIRE IN LOS GATOS.
Portion of the Masonic Block Com-

the Presbyterian church of this city, died
at about noon to-day. Deceased was pas
tor from ISS2 to ISSS of the Franklin-street
(formerly Larkin street) Presbyterian

CHARLES INGERSOLL. the ab
sconding Treasurer of Tompkins
County. New York, was arrested at
Eddy and Polk streets yesterday
morning by Detective Ross Whittaker
and taken to the City Prison to await the
.arrival of an officer from Ithaca, N. V.,
with the papers for his extradition. He
is accused of embezzling $15,000 belonging
to the county.
Ingersoll was a prominent politician in
Tompkins County and was four times In
succession elected to the office of Treas
urer, each term being for three years. He
was elected last November for the fourth
time, but shortly afterward it was dis- J
covered that something was wrong with
his accounts. He fled on December 12,
and an investigation .showed that there
was a deficiency of about $15,000. He
owned a big livery stable in Ithaca and
several houses which were mortgaged
and had over $6000 deposited In bank.
There Is a content in the courts now be
tween the county and his other creditors !
for possession of this money. After his \
disappearance everything belonging to j
him was sold by his creditors.
Ingersoll was located in lola, Kans., |
last month throuph a letter written j
to him by his sister, which he had '
CHARLES INGERSOLL, THE EMBEZZLER-
dropped In the street. He was arrested
and taken back to Ithaca, where he was
charged with forgery and embezzlement.
He pleaded guilty to the charge of em
bezzlement, but not guilty to the charge
of forgery, which arose from the alleged
manipulation of his books. He was re
leased on $10, OX) bonds about three weeks
ago and again fled, coming direct to this
city. He was located in a house on Eddy
street, nenr Polk, two or three days ago
by Superintendent Vannatta of the Pink
erton agency, who wired the fact to the
New York oflloe of the acency. The Pink
ertons then communicated with Sheriff
Seaman of Tompkins county and he wired
Chief Sullivan to arrest Ingersoll and an
officer would be sent on at once with the
papers for his extradition. Captain Sey
mour detailed Whlttaker on the case and

to embitter the political quarrel. Tn No
vember, ISC2, the State convention wa*
held and South Carolina declared tne tar
iff acts of IS2S and 1532 null and void and
forbade the payment of the duties. This
forced such an issue as delighted the Pres
ident's soldierly temper. He replied with
a proclamation declaring, "The laws of
the United States must be executed," and
denounced disunion by armed force as
treason. Land'and naval forces were dis
patched to Charleston, and the customs
collector was ordered to collect the du
ties, using what force was necessary. The
vigor of Jackson's treatment of nullifica
tion struck a popular chord and made him
more than ever the nation's hero. The
leaders of the nullificrs met and "suspend
ed" the operation of the treasonable or
dinance, and after the passage of the com
promise tariff act it was repealed. The nul
lification episode was the beginning of a
rupture in the Democratic party. Calhoun
and his sympathizers were soon claimed
by the Whigs. Opposition to Jackson In
various Southern States contributed to the
building up of the Whig party throughout
the South.
Jackson and the Bank.
It has been characteristic of American
democracy to look with suspicion upon the
political power of money, either in the
hands of individuals or of incorporated in
stitutions. Jackson shared the popular
prejudice against the United States Bank,
and his first annual message raised ther
question of its constitutionality and its ex
pediency, and suggested an early consid
eration'by Congress of the granting of a
new charter when it should be asked for.
The constitutionality of the bank had
been repeatedly affirmed by the highest
i judicial authority in the land, while the
present charter would not expire until
IS3S. Professor Sumner tells us that the
bank was now under most wise and care
ful management and in excellent condi
tion. The country waS tranquil and pros
perous and the currency was good. All
this was upset by the President,^ mes
sage. The currency became disordered
and the banks were troubled, while the
general feeling was one of uncertainty and
uneasiness. The vague recommendation
by the President of a bank "founded on
the credit of the Government and its rev
enues" as a substitute for that devised by
the great Federalist financier seemed to
point toward dangerous paper money
In 1532 Congress was asked to recharter
the bank, and the bill Passed both
Houses. It was promptly vetoed by the
President, and the National Republicans
were not strong enough to carry It over
the veto The question was now made a
party issue. As Professor Sumner says
of the President's supporters: The bank
nuestlon was one of the great questions
through which Jackson's popularity and
his will hammered them into a solid party
phalanx." The campaign of 1532 was
fought for "the bank or Jackson, and
Jackson won by an overwhelming major
ity over Clay. Henceforth he could not
but feel that In fighting the bank, as in
putting down nullification, he was carry
ing out the wishes of the people.
One of the principal functions of the
bank was the furnishing of facilities to
the Government for collecting and pay-
Ing out Its revenues without expense to
lfelf It was an arrangement not only
economical for the administration but ad
vantageous to the bank and to the peo
ple as it kept in circulation money
paid into the national treasury. But It
was true, as its enemies asserted, that It
gave the bank great political power; that
it might use its great sums of money for
Influencing elections. It might favor the
friends of the Government and oppress its
enemies. There seems to be no room for
doubt that in the election of 1532 the bank
did so use its financial power. Jackson had
always, regarded it a3 a strong agent in,
the hands of his opponents.
A clause in the charter permitted the
Secretary of the Treasury to deposit the
revenues in other banks at his discretion,
Jackson having by repeated removals and
new appointments secured a pliant Secre
tary who would do his bidding, caused
the deposits to be gradually with
drawn ard placed with certain banks
in the different States, which were
called the "pet banks." The national
bank, in consequence, became seri
ously embarrassed, and was forced to
stringent measures to protect Its credit.
Loans were called in. and great scarcity
of money resulted. Friends of the bank
In Congress were much exasperated. Web
ster and Clay succeeded in getting a vote
of censure upon the President passed
through the Senate. He replied with an
arrogant assertion of his own rrightot â to
his own interpretation of th"c constitution.
The unsettled condition of financial af
fairs, when the conservative influence of
the national bank having been destroyed
there was nothing to check the wild spirit
of speculation which overran the country,
at lastalarmedthe President. The national
debt had been paid, and even the reduced
tariff of 1533 brought in annually many
millions of surplus revenue. The Jackson
Democrats denied the constitutional
power of the Federal Government to use
the national funds for. internal improve
ments, declaring such undertakings to be
long to the States alone, and the Presi
dent vetoed or "pocketed" bills for such
purposes. What should be done with the
money which continued to pour into the
treasury? , .
According to a plan proposed by Cal
houn It was finally decided to' loan the
surplus without interest to the several
States in proportion to their Congres
sional representation. Nothing more was
needed to set the States off upon a course
of extravagant expenditures. The fever
for speculation became an epidemic.
Banks had multiplied Inordinately
through the country, all eager to share
In the favors bestowed upon the "pets."
The country was flooded with "rag
money," cheap and abundant. One of

Jackson's last official acts was the Issu
ing of the "specie circular." by which he
vainly hoped to retrieve the tmanciai dis
aster which had befallen the nation. This
provided that only gold and silver an<t
notes of specie-paying banks should be
received for public lands. The effect was
almost instantaneous. Money at once be
came scarce and interest enormously high,
and the great financial crisis of 1537 fol
lowed, with untold suffering to vast mul
titudes, paralysis of business and serious
interruption to the development of the
country. Nevertheless Jackson's attitude
toward the bank did on the whole com
mand the popular approval and continued
to do so, and so deeply did he Impress
upon the Democratic party his hostility
to a national bank of the sort which ho
had overthrown that opposition to such,
institutions has become a permanent
party principle. The National Republi
cans were forced to bear the odium of the
evils resulting from the struggle with the
bank and never again dared, to go into a
campaign, on that issue.
Abolitionism.
Jackson's time witnessed thÂ© rl3Â© of a
new movement for the destruction of sla
very. After the adoption of the Missouri
compromise In ls.'J tr.e opposition to sla
very was Quiescent for more than a de
cade, but about 1532 it started up with new
vigor and determination. Abolition socie
ties there had been from early colonial
days. Slavery was deprecated and apolo
gized for by the thoughtful and humane
North and South, and nearly all looked
for Its ultimate disappearance through
gradual emancipation. It was thus dying
out In the North, slowly Indeed, for as
late as IS4O a few slaves were still to be
found in Connecticut, New Hampshire,
Illinois, Wisconsin and other Northern
States. In 1529 William Lloyd Garrison, a
young printer in Baltimore, published a
demand for immediate abolition and the
use of every effort to bring it about, re
gardless of the interests or the wishes of
the slave owners. This has been likened
to the hurling of a firebrand into a pow
der magazine. Public feeling from one
end of the country to the other was soon,
aflame. Garrison issued the first number
of the Liberator in Boston January 1. ISSI.
The following year the New England
Anti-Slavery Society was formed to labor
for immediate abolition. The abolition of
slavery just at this time in the British
West Indies greatly stimulated Interest
in the subject in the United States. Abo
lition societies multiplied rapidly, and
many of the most able and earnest men
and women of the Northern States en
tered warmly into the crusade against the
great evil whose further tolerance they
regarded as a national sin. But slavery
hac! now become so thoroughly Intrenched
in the Southern States and so interwoven
with all their industrial and social life
that immediate emancipation was to them
a simple impossibility.
Naturally the violently aggressU-e atti
tude assumed toward their peculiar do
mestic institution by the new school of
agitators aroused the most intense indig
nation throughout the slave-holding
States. At one or two points this inflam
matory condition of public sentiment af
fected the administration of Jackson. For
several years the slave States had been
enacting laws punishing with outrageous
penalties the circulating of printed matter
calculated to excite dissatisfaction among
the slaves: and when, in 15.%, the aboli
tionists began to sow broadcast their per
nicious doctrines through the mails It was
felt that the emergency justified extreme
measures. The Postmaster at Charleston.
S. C, refused to deliver such incendiary
publications and appealed to the Post
master General for "instructions." Kcn
dal gave an ambiguous reply, but other
documents from his band, evidently "in
spired" by Jae*son himself, clearly show
ed his sympathy with the Southern view.
The President's message of lAÂ£ brought
the matter before Congress and proposed
a law prohibiting the circulation through
the mails of matter objectionable tr> the
South. Calhoun drew a bill in accordance
with the suggestion, but Congress reject
ed It, and in the accompanying discussion
it was made clear to many that slavery
and the freedom of thf* press could not
coexist. Not only did this attempt to es
tablish a censorship of the press In the
Interest of slavery come to naught, but
a bill was passed the same year forbid
ding postmasters unlawfully to retain any
mailed letter or parcel "with intent to
prevent the arrival and delivery of the
same."
In IS3G Michigan and Arkansas entered
the Union, the one with freedom, the
other with slavery. The anti-slavery
members of Congress, whose leader was
John Qulncy Adams, could not deny that
admission f>f the slave State of Arkansas
was implied in the provisions of the Mis
souri compromise, and no serious opposi
tion could be made.
Glancing swiftly over this momentous
era, we see "popular sovereignty" domi
nant in the person of the President, and
Congress subordinate, while the Demo
cratic party la consolidated as never be
fore. We recognize henceforth as Demo
cratic principles opposition to national
banks, to internal improvements and to
protection as a national policy: while the
party Is seen to be united In its adoption
of the spoils system, in its support of the
veto power, which Jackson freely used
throughout his "reign" as President had
never used It before, and united in gen
eral in its strict construction views of
constitutional questions, though deter
mined in resisting State assaults upon
Federal rights.

Nullification.
The spirit of the angry Southerners In
view of the passage of the tariff of IS2S
was set forth by Calhoun In the Exposi
tion and Protest of December of the same
; year. This paper declared that the sov
ereignty of the States was clearly estab
lished by constitutional precedents, and
that the constitutional relation of the
States to the Federal Government plainly*
Implied "a veto or control on the action
of the general Government." It suggested
that South Carolina should in convention
Impose the veto of the State upon the re
cent action of the central Government and
"decide In what manner the tariff act
ought to be declared null and void." Noth
ing followed at once upon the announce
ment of this bold proposition. A President
chosen by the Southern States was about
to enter upon the duties of hla office. It
seemed wise to wait and see what he
would do for his outraged friends.
It was soon clear that President Jackson
would brook no Infringement upon the
rights and powers of the Government of
which he was the head. Personal ill feel
ing between Jackson and Calhoun helped

MARIPOSA. April 29.â The celebrated
i Hite case, in which Mrs. Lucy Hite sued
! Millionaire John Hite for a division of the
community property, has come to an end
by & compromise for the sum of $21,000.
This means the end of a lengthy litiga
tion brought about by the Indian woman's
claims of wifehood.
John Hite w^s represented by "W. W.
Foote and F. J. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. The Indian woman employed as
her attorneys Van R. Paterson, Arthur
Rodgers, W. S. Church ar.d Charles Ilan
lon. but the compromise was effected
through the local attorneys of the de
fendant, Cqndon & Condon and W. B.
Church. It was reported last night that
in the settlement Kodgers and Paterson
were ignored and also Charles Hanlon, W.
S. Church remaining as the sole San
Francisco attorney. The Indian woman
will soon ask the courts to substitute W.
S. Church for all her former counsel. For
the money which the Indian woman will
receive she will release John Hite from all
claims that she may have against him.
Hite was a Mariposa miner in the pio
neer days and was fortunate in striking
a claim that made him a millionaire.
Lucy and he were on Intimate terms for
twenty years, as the testimony showed.
During one of his visits to San Francisco
Hite met and married Miss Nougues of
Oakland. This was in lSy7 and a year
later Lucy liled a suit for absolute di
vorce and her share of the community
property. The case was tried before
Judge Jones of Martinez, sitting in San
Francisco. Before the findings-were en
tered and the decree prepared he died
and several legai complications developed
in consequence.
A few months ago the attorneys of the
woman, according to stipulation, filed a
suit for $23.<>J0 for counsel fees. This was
to be tried before Juoge J. E. Prewett
within a few days. Some few legal com
plications In regard to the attorneys'
claims will certainly develop over the
case. ;

MORNING GAME.
Sacramento 4, Oakland 3.
Most of the excitement of the morninf?
game at Oakland was born In the ninth
inning, the score reading 3 all. With one
man entombed and the bags filled by Har
die, Schmeer and Hammond, Francks
came to the plate. He tried to bunt, but
his effort was lost in a gentle pop fly
right into Devereaux'3 mits, Schmeer be
ing doubled at third nnd the Dudes rele
gated to the field. This was Cal Ewlng's
cinch unpiped. Devereaux earned the credit
of winning the game for the Sacramento
men. Over the fence for a home run was
his star specialty, and then the bats were
packed.
. Bevelle and Salsbury did the twirling,
the former allowing but seven hits, while
the Oakland men worked off ten on Sals
bury. The seventh Inning was a bad one
for Bevelle. After one man had been sent
to the benches McLaughlin hit safely, and
the next three men walked. Devereaux
scored on Doyle's hit. The score:

FALSE RUMOR OF
A FOREIGN BOOK
AT EMERYVILLE
Closing Week of the Racing
Season at the Track Over
the Bay.
An Excellent Card of Running Events
To-Dayâ Barney Schreiber Will
Take Jockey Ruiz
East.
The report gained some credence in turf
circles yesterday that a foreign book
would be put in operation at Kmeryville
at the conclusion of the racing season
on Saturday next. It is a canard so ut
terly absurd as to scarcely merit deny
ing. Time and again Thomas H. Williams
Jr., president ol the Caliiornia JocKey
Club, has said no foreign dook would ever
Una a place on his track, and nothing
has occurred o- change his views. It waa
circulated, no douot. by the enemies of
clean and honest sport. .
from a recent report, Bookmaker Joe
Rose is more than apt to experience some
trouble in the far Kast over the ruling
maue uy the OaKland track folks in warn- J
ing him off the course. An Kasvern turf j
writer recently wired to California askin.< |
for particulars, so there must be "some- j
thing Uoing." i
.Barney bchreiber says he. Ijad an offer
for imp. Sain, but haruly up to the <20,000
notch. A purchaser of the black horse i
at that tigure could appropriately name !
the first of his get Insane.
Frank Eckert is reported to be $20,000
behind, as a result of this season's Cali- '
fornia trip. Much of It was lost specu
lating on the outside.
At one stage of the game Johnny Cole- |
man was probably $40,000 to the good. He ;
struck some squally weather, until the
sum has shrunk to about $5000.
"Sandy" Smith, the well-known reins
man, will leave this week for Cleveland,
under engagement with Millard Saunders.
"Sandy" went down the line last year
with Tom Keating.
Barney Schrelber will take Ruiz East
with him to do the heavy-weight riding
for his stable. The boy is a top-notcher if
he will attend to business.
The Denver meeting; which opens on
June 9, will attract a large number of
California horsemen. Already over a
dozen well-known stables have applied for
stall room. The purses are liberal and
the management sure. James J. Caldwell
will do the starting.

most closely contested ever seen on this
track was the motor tandem race for two
miles between Mcr'arland and Stevens

desperate sprint Houseman and Rutz
beat their opponents by the narrowest
kind of a margin. Summaries*

THREE STRAIGHT
GAMES WON BY
THE SENATORS
Sacramen'o Plays Champion
ship Bali lor E.ght
Innings.
The Morning Match at Oakland Is
Won in the Ninth by a Home
Run From Bevereaux's
Bat
Â»
Sacramento 5, Oakland 3.
For eight innings, with Hughes in the
box, Sacramento played a faultless game
of ball yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Park. No errors, fast fielding and
good stick work made championship ball
of the Senators' play. In the last Inning
Hughes was touched for a couple of hits,
which, combined with an error, allowed
the only runÃ Oakland secured.
Moskiman did the pitching for the
Dudes, and was not hit very hard, but
his support was as ragged at times as It
waa brilliant at others. Schmeer distin
guished himself in a mixture of hot and
cold baseball, earning as many groans as
cheers.
Run getting started in the second. Two
men in the graveyard, and Doyle went to
llr-st, hit by the pitcher, scoring on Shan
ahan's double. The next Inning brought
two runs to the Senators. McLaughlln
walked, advancing a base on Devereaux's
hit, both runners appropriating a base on
Eagan's out. Mat Stanley then hit to
Schmeer, who juggled, McLaughlin and
Devereaux crossing the rubber.
The lifth brought Sacramento a single
tally, and showed some pretty infield
work by the Dudes. Mclaughlin, who waa
safe at first on Hutch's error, scored on
Eagan's double. Stanley rolled a hot one
to Schmeer, who threw him out at first,
and Hutchinson shot the ball to third,
where Eagan's runner died.
The ninth for Oakland opened with a hit
for Hardie and another for Schmeer, who
seemed to be able to locate Hughes'
curves. A juggle by Stulte of Hammond's
grounder and some good base running re
sulted in sending Hardie, Schmeer and

Toward noon the wind became steadier
and the fleet pet sail under Fignal from
th<Â» flaeship May. A course was set to

shoot of the eighth annual tourna
ment of the California Inanimate
Target Association was held in this
city to-day at the grounds of the
Fresno Gun Club near the Pollasky depot.

one, the men having to shoot in a driz
zling, cold rain. Notwithstanding the na
ture of the day there was a large crowd
In attendance to witness the bluerock
breaking and the gunners were out in
force. Only three of the day's events
were concluded, but some of the numbers
will be consolidated so as to complete the
tournament to-morrow without cuttingthi
programme. The weather interfered ma
terially with the marksmanship and few
good scores were made, some of the best
shooters falling below their standard.
Fred Fuedner made the only clean score
of the day.
The events shot were: The first for the
Lincoln Gun Club trophy, the second tor
the Empire Gun Club trophy and the third
for the E. T. Allen cup. The scores made

Bsspite His Disposition to Sulk, F.
W. Brode's Chances Are Re
garded as Exceptionally
Good.
LOUISVILLE. April 29.-At Churchill
Downs next Thursday will be inaugurated
what promises to be the greatest -race in
the history of the Louisville Jockey Club.
Already the city is filling up. and It Is ex
pected that fully CO.OOO people will witness
the Kentucky Derby. As It now looks,
there will be a field of eight starters, and
possibly ten. The sure ones are: Lieu
tenant Gibson. Kentucky Farmer, F. V,'.
Brode. Hindus, Highland I^ad. Florlzar,
His Excellency and Benader. To these
may be added Thrive and Flaunt. Flaunt
worked the Derby route this morning in
2:10.
Although Lieutenant Gibson's stock has
depreciated during the past fortnight, he
will still go to the post a marked favorite.
Tom McDowell's colt His Excellency will
receive some consideration, as he made a
mile and an eighth on the Lexington track
In 1:54%. Notwithstanding F. \V. Brode's
ugly temper, hia owner says he will start
him in the Derby. He has sulked In his
last two races, but it may be that he will
take a notion to run kindly on Thursday.
If he should run to his California form
he would be a hard horse to beat. Ken
tucky Farmer will start, but his prepara
tion has been so slow and conservative
that he has few friends. Highland Lad
will be put in as the pacemaker for his
stable companion. Floiizar. Although not
considered a mile and a quarter horse, if
he goes after Lieutenant Gibson for the
first seven-eights he may prove bother
some to the backers of that colt. Hindus
Is a dark one.
By the time the Memphis continent ar
rives to-morrow there will be 1000 horses
here. The Turf Congress handicap, worth
about $3500. will be run on Saturday. It
has Bansle. John Bright, Pink Coat and
other good ones In It.

A Wild Rumor Circulated
About the Seven Sisters
Turning Turtle.
The Schooner L-eft Here for the Cape
Nome Goldfields Last Wednesday
With a Party of Fortune
Hunters.
A wild story about the schooner Seven
Sisters was circulated around the water
front yesterday. It was told with all
kinds of circumstantial details that the
vessel had turned turtle. One story had
it that some of the passengers and crew
had been brought into port by a coasting
steamer, while another, which started
late in the afternoon was to the effect
that all hands had been drowned. As far
as can be ascertained, there was not a
word of truth in either story. After hours
of diligent Inquiry the Merchants' Ex
change failed to discover where the
story emanated from and told all inquir
ers that there was no truth In the yarn.
The Seven Sisters is a schooner of 130
tons burden and has been running on the
coast for the last dozen years. About a
month ago she was chartered by the Anvil
Gold Mining Company and fitted out fcr
a voyage to Cape Nome. When ready to
Fail it was generally remarked along the
front that she was topheavy and was
liable to come to grief in heavy weather.
She left here last Wednesday and ran
Into the northwester, and these facts
probably led to the story of a disaster
that were bo â¢persistently circulated.
The schooner Five Brothers went out
late Saturday and may during her run
north overhaul the Seven Sisters.
Change in Sailors' Home.
Captain Melvln Staples, who has been
identified with the Sailors' Home for quit?
a number of years, retires from that in
stitution on May L During his term as
superintendent many of the abuses that
were practiced in the Institution were
done away with and the place became
what it was intended to be â a home for
sailors. John Ferem will succeed Cap
tain Stapl ;s as superintendent. He is
thoroughly acquainted with the business
and holds the respect of every sailor that
comes to San Francisco.
Water Front Notes.
The German bark Henry Clement Is now
out 2C7 days from Hamburg for Klao
chau, and 60 per cent reinsurance Is being
paid on her. She was last heard of on
AuÃUst 23 last, when she was spoken in
latitude 15 north, longitude 26 west. The
rhanres are that she will Join the Annie
Thomas amors the list of "missing" in a
few days.
The steamer Curacao arrived from Mex
ican ports via San Pedro yesterday. She
brought up a valuable cargo of concen
trates, which was taken to Selby's smelt
ing works during the afternoon.
The transport Westminster will get
away to-day and the Warren to-morrow.
In order to have the vessels ready on time
Captain Dunn and his men have been
working night and day. The cargo only
began to arrive for the Warren last Sat
urday, but CaptÃin Dunn says It will be
all aboard and the ship ready for sea on
Tuesday morning.

been unwise."
This amendment was opposed by Wil
liam T. Glbbs, the chairman of the Investi
gating committee and the senior elder of
the church, who made a short state
ment to the effect that the special com
mittee had Investigated the matter long
and carefully; that they had called Into
consultation with them the leaders of the
Christian church throughout the State,
and that the report as presented had been
prepared with care. He objected to the
amendment upon the further ground that
the committee had heard the evidence and
that it was best able to jud?e as to the
verdict that should be passed.
Rev. Guy W. Smith ar>neared before the
church and made an address denying any
wrong-doing and askine forgiveness of
the church and his God if wrong had been
done. He admitted that possibly some of
his actions mlsrht have been unwise, but
he protested that there was nothing worse
behind them.
In a vote upon the amendment offered it
was decided to make the substitution.
there being but one vote against itâ that
of William T. Gibbs. the chairman of the
committee.
This closes* the matter as far as the
First Christian Church is concerned.

INDIANAPOLIS. Ind.. April 29.-The |
leaders of the gold standard movement I
within the Democratic party In 1596. who
recently sent out letters to prominent ,
members that the organization was ask- 'Â¦
lr.g the advisability of calling a con- i
ferer.ee, have received more than 300 re
p'.'es, and the conference will be held in a
few fiajE. Great Interest has been added
to the proposed gathering by reason of
the fact that it may start a boom for '
Admiral Dewey for the Presidency by ap
pointing a commttee to wait upon him
er.i solicit his acceptance of the nomina
tion at the hai:ds of the national gold
Democratic organization.
Local managers say there are many Re
pufcllcar.s who do not want to vote for
sk'clCir.ley and many Democrats who do
pot want to vote for Bryan, and they be
lieve Admiral Dewey would be satis
factcrv to both these elements and would
jv>n a* large vote in the East and West.
Gold Democrats say they do not want a
distinctively gold standard national ticket. ,
r^ecause they do not want to make a cam
paign on ar. Issue which has ceased to
exist; but they will r.ot vote for Bryan or
for McKlnley, ar.d Dewey Is the logical
candidate for both the discontented Dem
rtr-^stn Â«nrt Hfnt'.Wlmrt.
DEWEY IS "HEDGING."
Intimates Now That -xÂ« Doesn't
Want the Nomination.
Epeclxl IXsrtteh to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 29.â The World has
thl? from Washington:
'"I do not know but I will be happier on
July 5 to receive a message announcing
that Eryan has been nominated than I
am now as a prospective candidate," said
Admiral Dewey yesterday. He was Bitting
C". the broad piazza cf his country house
tt Eeauvoir. luxuriating In the bright,
shiny sunshine.
"Really.*! he said. "I do not know why
: Eboold wast to be President. The people
have given me everything 1 could wish
for. I have had honor enough thrust
upon me by my countrymen, so it cer
â¢V.r.'.y could" not have been ambition that
prompted mv entrance into politics. Then
v : y was it?"
T v e admiral finds answer to this ques
:n the Interview he gave the World
tr.r.Our.cir.g his candidacy, wherein he
said he had received many urgent re
qnerts from his countrymen that he be a
candidate, and if the American people
war.ted him he would be only too willing
to serve.
"Yec. that was it. I said I would be
â¢rids* to serve If they wanted me: and
f n I am." said the admiral. "They have
f...i I am In my dotage, that 1 must be
crazy, ar.d other things of that port; but
that does not worry me. I ehall not flinch
\â¢ ' r>= the mud batteries. I am In the
lght ar.d I shall stay in. but." and here
be admiral looked out at the peach trees
fast bursting into bloom, "it is very beau
liful here."
The admiral Is not without hope of be
ing nominated at Kansas City. He re
gards Bryan as the candidate of the Pop
ulists and the exponent of Populist prin
ciples, for which the real Democratic
;>arty Is not willing to stfind. He will go
I ; â¢ f -re the convention as a candidate of
! the Democrats standing for Democratic
principles. _
SAYS DEWEY WILL RETIRE.

Y.';!<=on. author cf the Wilson tariff bill,
while !n this city en route from Hot
Springs to Nebraska City. Nebr., where
he if to b* the guest of J. Sterling Mor
ton, his associate in Cleveland's Cabinet.
"It Is to b*> McKlnley and Bryan. Mr.
Cleveland will not allow his name to be
ra^r.tion^d and Dewey will not get an op
portunity to see himself voted down.
Jirvan will be named, but conditions are
*.>> "changed That the campaign will be on
new line*. Both sides have so many new
conditions to confront that the old tactics
will not do. I think the Democrats will
win. WÂ» shall po Into the fight solid."
Mr Wilson cave expression to his views
regarding the candidacy of Admiral
"He* Is ir.r.ocer.t of the game of poli
tic?," he said, "and has blundered In his
t!ur.rr.Â«^-s as blunt people often do. He
will biur.df -r out of It again as suddenly

<i- Â¦ lie generally anticipates and when
the row is at its height he will surprise
everybody by sailing away, or I am mis
taken In the man."

NEILL EXCELS IN
BRIGHT COMEDY
S'TBODT who can appreciate wit,
A humor and good situations in a pip.y
can find a real hearty laugh by
â¢ witnessing James Neill In '"The
Gilded Fool" at the California. The play
! is not new. but it has the merit of being
| true to life as It parses in these days.
1 and is acted by one of the most compact
j and well balanced companies that has re
cently visited this city. Everything moves
with a vim that Is refreshing, and there
is not a tiresome moment In the perform
ance.
This Is the fourth wek of the work of
the company In this city, and as "A Gilded.
Fool" Mr. N<?111 shows another side of his
versatile abilities and gives a fine charac
terization of the old character of the fÂ«ol
and his money soon parted. The play,
which is by Henry Guy Carleton. is fair's'
well equipped with bright, catchy llnf-s.
and the opportunities for indulging in a
lauph are many.
Mr. Neill was not a gilded fool when he
selected his company, for it works in har
mony with the star and leaves little
ground for criticism from a liberal stand
point. As a result of their efforts the
audience is shown a series of home pic
tures in our great metropolis. In which the
high pressure of stock gamt-.-ng life is il
lustrated, and there is a genuine love
story in fact two, to make them piquant.
Mr. Neill's best assistant In the pre
sentation of the clever comedy was Julia
Dean as N>ll Audrey Ruthven. Her work
was particularly bright and vivacious and
was appreciated. However, the house was
a cold one and decidedly unappreciative of
the good things set before it. Edythe
Chapman as Margaret Ruthven displayed
an exceptionally good speaking voice and
commendable ability in the love scene.
Ben Howard as the villain and Frank
Mac Vicars as the victim were quite ac
ceptable. The sarr.<? may be said of John
W. Button in the part of the Rev. Jacob
Howell. The other parts were well sus
tained.
Orpheum.
Manager Morrisey is properly puffed up
these days, owing to the fact that he is
presenting one of the best vaudeville
shows that can be found in any city in the
land. The working of the big Orpheum
circuit has brought together a lot of stars
that are entertainers from the first to the
last curtain. The reai star of the com
bination is Etta Butler, a San Francisco
girl and daughter of famous old John
Butler. She has the gift of mimicry de
veloped to an unusual degree, and with a
good singing voice does a turn that cap
tured New York and is making a suc
cessful siege to this hypercritical town.
There are other new features for this
Â«reek which include Bauman and Adelle.
sketch artists: Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Sid
man in a pastoral sketch. Little Fred and
his trair.pd animals and the Brothers For
rest, musical clowns. The house was pack
ed yesterday at the matinee and at the
evening performance.
FIRE IN THE HOLD
OF THE WILLAMETTE
SEATTLE, Wash.. April 29.â The big
steam collier "Willamette, operating be
tween this port and San Francisco by the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, took
fire to-day while loauing at the King-street
bunkers and was sunk in thirty feet of
water in order to save her from the
flames.
The blaze originated in a large quantity
of lime, which she had just taken on as
cargo. After an hour's work the officers
and crew of the vessel were unable to
stop the progress of the flames, and at
5:30 o'clock the fire department was sum
moned. Floods of water were thrown
through the hatches, but falling on the
burning lime only added to the combus
tion. It was decided to scuttle the ves
sel, and at 7:30 o'clock she sank, two port
holes having boen opened. A crowd of
5000 persons gat in-red to witness the bat
tle with the flames.
The officers or* the vessel and of her op
erating company Fay that the damage will
not exceed ST.OOQ. The machinery is said to
be uninjured. The- vessel Is of iron, and
only her woodwork in the vicinity of the
place where the fire broke out, almost
amidships, is said to be burned. She will
be raised at low tide to-morrow.
CAPTAIN HOOPER OF THE
REVENUE SERVICE DEAD
OAKLAND. April 29.â Captain Calvin L.
Hooper of the Revenue Marine Service,
who once commanded the McCulloch
and then the Bear, died to-night at his
home, 202 Santa Rosa avenue, after a pro
tracted illness. He was one of the promi
nent captains of his branch of the Ber
vice.
UNLIKE the Paris Exposition, the
teachers" great festival at Glen
Park will be ready In every* par
ticular to open to-morrow morning
at the hour fixed and to proceed
gayly and successfully to its close in the
evening. The sale of tickets has been
enormous, and when the gate admissions
are considered it becomes evident that the
crowd In attendance will be a tremendous
one.
The park will have the appearance of
an exposition ground on a small scale,
with all the gay decorations, streamers,
flowers, banners, booths, bands of music
and throngs of gay people making merry
on all sides.
The teachers are enthusiastic over the
assured financial success of their under
taking, and donations continue to pour
In. The fine flagpole Just outside of the
Pacific Heights cafe has been donated by
Bolander & Perkins to the Annuity So
ciety and is for sale. Bids may be left
in charge of Miss Stohr, secretary of the
society, at the headquarters of the execu
tive committee.

OPENING OF THE NEW
TUNNEL IS CELEBRATED
Glen Park Attracts a Crowd on the
Initial Day of Season's
Festivities.
The completion of the Bosworth-street
tunnel and the opening of Glen Park un
der the auspices of its new manager, C.
F. Kapp. was the occasion of a double
celebration yesterday. The executive
committee of the Mission Federation of
Improvement Clubs rode to the park
through the tunnel in the Market Street
Railroad Company's tourists' car Her
mosa, which was placed at its disposal.
The trip through the tunnel was cele
brated by a discharge of firecrackers,
accompanied by lusty cheering. On the
arrival of the party in the park Manager
Kapp's hospitality was thoroughly en-
Joyed by members of the committee, who
partook of a bounteous lunch which he
had prepared for them. ,
President Lillie of the improvement
club acted as toastmaster. and the health
of the railroad magnates and all those
who were instrumental in giving railroad
facilities to Glen Park were drunk.
The owners and managers of the San
Francisco and San Mateo electric railroad,
which was the first to run cars into the
park, came in for a rousing cheer when
George W. Elder had concluded his re
marks regarding the liberality of this
road.
Those who responded to toasts for their
clubs were W. J. Nixon, West of Castro
Street Club: Thomas Crouch, Falrmount
Club; Dr. E. M. Torello. Mission and Five-
Mile House Club; W. P. Bell. Sunnyside
Club; W. Laveronia, South San Francis
co Club; D. I. Wyatt, Eureka and Park
Lane Club; Joseph P, Tuohey, clubs' sec
retary; Gua Schnee and Chris Stader, for
the good and welfare of the Mission dis
trict.
To the following committee of arrange
ments ; may be credited, the success of the
entertainment: Joseph P. Tuohey, W. J.
Nixon. â¢ H. S. Â¦ Wlnkler,- A. S. Lillie, G.
Schnee, Chris Stader. W.. P. Bell, Thomas
Crouch. R. W. Smith and John Barrett.
The attendance was about 1500.
Manager Kapp had an assorted pro
gramme of music and- literary exercises
arranged. for the afternoon, a balloon as
cension being one of the features. This,
however,, turned out, to -be a flat failure.
It was announced that Professor Romalne
would make his "awe-inspiring slide for
life. But the daring professor bumped
head foremost against the hard ground
by_reason of the balloon collapsing before
it had been cut loose from its, moorings.
Professor Romaine, the aeronaut, struck
his head against the hard earth and was
rendered unconscious, but after receiving
some stimulants he recovered sufficiently
to be removed by his brother, C. W. Bail
who was present. Yesterday's ascension
was Romaine's first in San Francisco, and
will probably be his last in Glen Park, as
this place is considered unlucky for aero
nauts.
GUN FIGHTER IS
KNOCKED OUT BY
BOLD HORSEMAN
Wyatt Earp Floored by a
Single Blow From Tom
Mulqueen. Â»
Engaged in a Saloon Bow Over the
Recent Turf Scandal and the
Gambler Gets the
Worst of It.
?
Wyatt Earp. gun-fighter and all around
bad man, was knocked down and out late
Saturday night by Tom Mulqueen, the
well-known racehorse man. The trouble
occurred In a Market street resort, near
Stockton, and was precipitated by Earp.
Both men had been drinking at the bar,
when Earp brought up the subject of the
recent pcjmdal at the Tanforan track. He
made several disparaging remarks about a
jockey who is on very friendly torms with
Mulqueen. When called down he became
belligerently indignant and threatened to
wipe the floor with the horse owner. In
stantly Mulqueen grabbed him. and after
throwing him as-ainst the bar landed a
blow on the gun-fighter's face, knocking
him out.
John Farley, the proprietor of the sa
loon, fearing serious trouble between the
two men. managed to induce Mulqueen to
leave the place. Earp. after recovering
from the effects of the blow, was also led
from the saloon and placed aboard a pass
ing street car. Earp was not armed at
the time, having left his trusted "gun"
with a friend shortly before the occur
rence.
Mulqueen was around as usual yester
day but refused to discuss trie affair. He
gained considerable notoriety several
years ago by calling down Bob Fitzsim
inons. the prize-fiphter. They were in a
Falocn drinking, when the ex-champion
referred to Jim Corbett as a looking-glass
fighter. Mulqueen promptly resented the
remark and threatened to break Fitzsim
mnns' head if he repeated it. FKzslm
mons. scenting trouble, left the place, not
caring to mix it with the plucky horse
man.
Earp first came into prominence in this
city when he officiated as referee in the
fight between .Fitzsimmons and Sharkey
several years ago and pave the decision to
the sailor on an alleged foul after he had
been knocked out. a decision that created
general dissatipfactlon.

Mrs. Sadie Gray died at St. Luke's Hos

of April 26, yesterday. On that date her
house at 110 Sussex street caught fire from
the overturning of a coal-oil heater. Mrs.
Gray could have escaped easily, but she
thought of her dogs, and resolved to res

rushed out into the yard, apparently un
mindful of the fact that her lower gar

The house was a total loss, but the wo
man saved her pets, although she sacri

moved at once to the hospital, but the
physicians expressed the fear that there
was but little hope, for her recovery.
Yesterday she breathed her last. Mrs.
Gray was 30 years old and a native of
England.

BULLET IN HIS BRAIN,
BOTTLE IN HIS HAND
Henry George Fixsen went to a vacant
lot on Thirteenth and Alpine streets early
yesterday morning, and after taking a big
drink of whisky sent a bullet through his
brain. An hour or so. later the body was
found by Mrs. J. J. Flynn of 4 Devisadero
street, who reported' the case to the Cor
oner. The body was still warm when the
Coroner's deputies arrived. A half-filled
bottle of liquor, and a cheap revolver lay
at a short distance from the suicide, for
the body had rolled down the small hill
after the shot was fired.
Fixsen had placed the muzzle of the pis
tol in his mouth, and the bullet tore an
ugly hole through the top of his head.
Papers in his pockets showed that Fixsen
was a native of Germany and 27 years of
age. He was a member of the National
Union of United Brewery Workmen, af
filiating with that body In February last.
He had been employed in the malt house
of the Jackson Brewery on Mission street.
The cause of his suicide is not known.
Fixsen resided at the Lindell House. 202
Sixth street. He met with an accident
several years ago and had been subject
to fits of despondency ever since.

BOLD BURGLARY
COMMITTED IN
CHINESE STORE
Two Thousand Dollars in
Coin and Valuables Made
Away With.
Chung Lee's Treasure Box Opened
and Robbed Scarcely Before the
Shades of Night Had
Fallen.
A report was made to the police at the
California-street station last night of the
theft of nearly $2000 In coin and jewelry
from the office of Chung Lee, a shirt
manufacturer, at 810 Jackson street. The
crime was committed before S o'clock in
the evening.
When Lee went to his store last night
he was startled to find that the door of
the place had been broken open. He Im
mediately blew for the police and a num
ber of officers responded.
Investigation showed that the burglars
had ilrst attempted to effect an entrance
through a window, and marks of the
"Jimmie" were visible on the sill. They
finally pried the door open.
After searching everything In the place
they came to a treasure chest which was
concealed on an upper shelf. It was
locked and they broke it open.
The contents consisted of $500 In gold
coin, $tXÂ»O in silver coin, $600 worth of jew
elry, among which was a pair of bracelets
valued at $300, and several little trinkets.
The proprietor of the place thinks that
he was robbed by his countrymen, but the
police believe that the crime was com
mitted by professional crooks.
POLICEMEN FIRE
THREE SHOTS AT
FLEEING CROOKS
Officers Clark, Colen and
Kissane Outfooted by
the Burglars.
Richard Nolan and Robert Hoffman
Axe Later Arrested and Charged
With the Crime at City
Prison.
Three valiant "cops" were gnashing
their teeth and bewailing their misfortune
yesterday because of their failure to cap
ture two bold burglars who were almost
within their grasp early In the morning.
As Just now such an event might lead to
promotion in the department the disap
pointment and chagrin of the policemen
may be readily understood. However, the
officers somewhat made amends last night
by landing two men behind the bars, the
same they aver who run the gauntlet of
bullets earlier in the day.
Early yesterday morning Policeman
Clark of the special "tenderloin" detail
was passing the Club saloon, on the cor
ner of Taylor and O'Farrell streets when
he heard a noise that made him pause
and listen. "Burglars," he whispered to
himself and then he hurried to get as
sistance. He met Policemen Colen and
Kissane Â£nd told them of his discovery.
They tightened their belts, drew their re
volvers and crept stealthily along toward
the saloon.
As the policemen arrived within a few
yards of their destination two young men
came out of the saloon, each carrying
some bottles of liquor and boxes of cigars.
When they saw the "cops" they dropped
their plunder and fled.
"Halt, or I'll tire," yelled Colen.
"Fire away and be hanged to you,"
yelled back one of the burglars.
The burglars were better sprinters than
the policemen and realizing that they
would make their escape unless brought
to earth the officers sent three bullets
whizzing past their ears. Before they
could fire again the burglars had got out
of the range of the bullets and were lost
in the darkness.
The trio of disappointed "cops" returned
to the saloon, puffing and blowing with
their unusual exertions and gathered up
the bottles of liquor and cigar boxes,
which they sent to the City Prison to be
marked as evidence against two bold bur
glars who were too fleet of foot to be cap
tured, but might at some future date fall
into the clutches of the law.
Colen and Clark hid themselves in a
doorway near the saloon for an hour or
two In the hope that the burglars would
return for their plunder, but they were
sadly disappointed.

WILL COMBINE
AGAINST SUEZ
CANAL TRAFFIC
An Important Conference of
Railroad and Steamship
Men To-Day.
An Attempt Will Be Made to Divide
Oriental Business Without Main
taining' Ruinous Com
petitive Kates.
Representatives of all the big transcon
tinental railroads and trans-Pacific steam
ship lines will meet in this city to-day to
confer upon rates. The principal object
of the meeting is to form a combination
against the Suez canal competition,
which, because of the close rivalry of the
trans-I'acilic lines, has proved a very
costly proposition. This conference will
be the iirst of the kind that has ever been
held in this city. It will bring together
the brightest railroad and steamship men
in the country, and it is expected that the
results will be important to the Oriental
trade. Apparently the object of the meet
ing is not. as has been repeatedly stated,
to advance trans-Pacific rates, but rather
to readjust them so that the competing
lines will not cut each other's throat.
"1 cannot say now what the outcome
of the meeting will be," said Second Vice-
President Paul Morton of the Santa Fe
at the Palace Hotel last night. "My un
derstanding: is that we are to have a gen
eral tulk over trans-Pacific rates and try
to come to some understanding whereby
1 the business can be fairly divided with
out cutting each other's throat, and a
combination formed against the Suez
canal competition. The proposition is not
to form a permanent rate-making organi
zation or to raise rates in general. No
doubt wo will agree to raise some rates,
but it is just as probable that others will
be lowered. The main object is to form
some basis of competition with the Suez
canal people."
Many notable railroad and steamship
men have been gathering here for several
days to participate in the conference.
Those who came with Mr. Morton's party
yesterday were Passenger Traffic Mana
ger George F. Nicholson and Freight
Traffic Manager \V. B. Bid well of the
Santa Fe and their clerks. F. Dodwell of
Tacoma. general agent of the Northern
Pacific Steamship Company, and G.
Whealler, Hongkong manager of the
Dodwell line, arrived on an early train,
and with them E. D. Brown, general man
ager of the Empress line of steamships to
China and Japan, and Robert Kerr, pas
senger traffic manager of the Canadian
Pacific Railway. A. S. Mihara, manager
of the Hongkong branch of the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha, arrived late Saturday
night from the north, having come over
the Empress line in response to a cable
summons. He is the only representative
of his company here. D. Miller, second
vice president of the Great Northern, and
Francis B. Clark, general traffic manager
of the same line, are at the Palace. J. M.
Hannaford, vice president and traffic
manager of the Northern Pacific, is the
only representative of that company here.
E. W. Tilden Kobe manager, and J. S.
Van Buren, Hongkong manager of the
Pacific Mail Company, Occidental and Ori
ental and Toyo Kaisen Kaisha, arrived
here several days ago to attend the con
ference. Other important officials here
are J. M. Bosworth, freight traffic mana
ger of the Canadian Pacific Railway; J. j
M. Johnson, third vice president of the
Chicago. Rock Island and Pacific, and A.
T. "\\ ells, general freight agent of the
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad. There
are several other prominent railroad men
who have been in the city for several
days. W. G. Neimyer, general Western
freight and passenger agent of the South
ern Pacific Company at Chicago is also
here.
A. S. Mihara of the Nippon Yusen
Kaisha said last night he had no idea
what the conference would try to do.
"My company," he said, "operates near
ly seventy steamships all over the world.
The only line we do not compete in is be
tween Liverpool and New York, and we
may yet be in that trade. We have but
four steamers in the trans-Pacific at the
present time and maintain only a monthly
service, but that is only a beginning."
The conference will probably last for a
week or ten days, and in the interim more
of the Oriental agents may arrive.
