ft his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for President and has jumped into the front seat In the Bryan
ffy, Jf bandwagon. This declaration was made here to-night by AV. S. Thomas, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, and was called forth by requests Mr. McLean sent to the Democratic State Central Com

Bernard of Cincinnati. McLean's trusted lieutenant, was there armed with a letter from Mr. McLean, which he
showed to committee members. In it there were two requests. The first was that some week other than Dewey week
in Columbus be selected for the State convention meeting. The second was that Webster P. Huntington, who resigned
the editorship of the Columbus Press because of its editorial flop to the support of Dewey for the Presidential nomi
nation, be named for- temporary chairman of the convention.

Mr. Thomas said that no misconstruction could be placed on McLean's action. It is taken to mean that Dewey's

ENGLAND MUST
DISAVOW THE SEA
WITCH INCIDENT
Special Dispatch to The CaH.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, May 4.â Great Britain will be
required to , formally disavow the
search of the American ship Sea
Witch, providing the assertion of
her commanding officer that she
was overhauled in Portuguese
waters is proved. In its instruction
to Embassador Choate the State
Department expressed confidence
that the British Government would
take the course usually followed in
such matters. The instruction was
very friendly in tone, but Secretary
Hay left "it to be inferred that this
Government could not tolerate the
search of an American ship ' In
neutral waters. Had the search
occurred orr the high seas a differ
ent complexion would have been
placed upon the affair. _^
It is the expectation of the State
Department, that the British Gov
ernment will cable to South Africa
and direct that an investigation be
made. Should the investigation
show that the vessel was over
hauled in neutral waters it is ex
pected that Great Britain will apol
ogize; otherwise there may be a
diplomatic controversy growing out
of the incident.
Dr. Hollis, American Consul at
Lourenzo 'Marques, has cabled to
the State Department the deposi
tion of the master of the Sea Witch
relative to her search. It appears
from this statement that the vessel
was proceeding woll within Portu
guese waters when the British
warsh'.p was discovered. A signal
was at or.ee made and the Sea
Witch was told to heave-to. When
she- had complied with the direction
she was boarded and the crew
searched her from stem to stern
for contraband. The search was
unsuccessful and the Sea Witch
was allowed to proceed on her
course.

"We occupied Brandfort to-day without
much opposition and without. I hope,
many casualties. The first brigade of
mounted infantry covered the left flank
of the Fourteenth Brigade of the Seventh

DEFENSE OF BULLER

quence of the publication General Buller
had tendered his resignation, which was
refused. Lord Lansdowne replied that the
War Office had no knowledge of such a
step.
Proceeding, Lord Rosebery declared
General Buller had been placed In a cruel
position, pointing out 'that after the de
licious Joy of the public at the relief of
Ladysmith the War Office had set to work
to publish everything damaging, critical
and censorious upon General Buller in or

outward signs existed, and they were now

For Trial on His Own
Testimony.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. May 4.
Without raising his voice in defense and
willingly deferring to every proposition
of the prosecutors, Simon Vetsera was
held in $7500 bail to-day for trial upon
three charges of assault to rob, the ex

imprisonment en each charge.
Only one of the five Oakland victims of

the mask and the revolver that was

ODDS ARE AGAINST THEM
Outnumbered Two to One by Old Eli's
Athletes, Who Have the Ad
vantage of Being Ac
climated.
NEW HAVEN. Conn.. May 4.â The first
meet that California has had with Eastern
athletes since 1S95 will occur to-morrow,
and the team is determined to uphold the
honors gained by that famous 1S93 team,
which defeated every college in the coun
try.
"I have never seen a more determined
bunch of athletes," said a Yale man to
day.
And they are a determined bunch, be
cause every man on the team says that he
will run until he drops and that with
every stride he takes he will think of
dear old California in the foothills of
Berkeley.
In some events Tale will run two men,
while California will run but one man.
For this reason Yale thought it would be
fairest to only count firSt places, which
proposition was, of course, accepted by
Captain Drum.
Captain Drum is very confident and ex
pects to win by a score of 7 to 5. He has
prophesied that we will win the two hur
dles, high and broad jump, hammer throw,
one of the distance runs and the pole
vault. Modesty forbade him from saying
that hf thought he wduld win the quarter.
California's sprinter has got against him

Snitzer. Yale's end rush of the football
team, also a graduate of St. Matthew's
School, California, when seen on the
campus to-day made the following state
ment:
"I think that the chances of both team3
are equal, although Yale has the advan
tage of being accustomed to the climate."
Cunha, Yale's 'varsity baseball catcher,
mRde the following statement: "I think
that California has the advantage from
what I have seen of them." Cunha pre
pared for Yale at Lowell High School, San
Francisco. The general opinion of the
Yale men is that it will be a close match,
and that if California wins it will be by a
small margin. .,
- The -Yale bojy, have< shown â¢ thsmsrt ves
to be gentlemen In every sense .of the
word. They have treated every one like
kings, and it will never be forgotten by
us. Our only hope is that we can have
a chance to repay them.
This afternoon Plaw was practicing with
Flannigan, the great Irish hammer throw
er, who has competed with all the East
ern men. He said that our young Califor
nian was the finest hammer thrower that
he ever saw. end that he had not yet
reached his limit. Flaw's triple turn was
an eye-opener to Flannigan. Plaw threw
the lead missile over 160 feet this after
noon. We had a number of Yale men visit
our headquarters to-night, and they all
wished us good luck, but still we could see
that they did not mean it.
We were also visited by two Califor
nians. Charles lluse, class of 1W0 of Cali
fornia, and John Lindley, a former t>tu
dent of Lowell High School, San Fran
cisco.
Clippings from The Call containing ac
counts of our baseball game with Stan
ford were received here to-night. They
were read by Captain Drum to the team.
At the reading of any man's name there
was' given a rousing cheer. To-morrow
we will go on the field with no more than
five Callfornians to cheer us on to vic
tory, but we will go into It as if the whole
college were there and cheering us every
moment.

BY p. M. WALSH-
THE police have Barry Getz. a young
ne'er-do-well, in the tanks, and they
believe they have the man -who for
the past few weeks has been terror
izing the paths of the late homegoers.
They believe he is the highwayman who
held up Hedburg on Wednesday mornlns
and the one who shot Bortzmeyer^Thurs
day morning. He has not been formally
charged with^any crime, but he .will be
taken to the Waldeck. where Bortz
meyer is lying, and if he be identified by
the injured man the charge will follow.
Getz Is a brother of the Getz who runs
the Manhattan Saloon on Geary street.
He lives with his mother at 930 E1H3 street
and yet has no means of livelihood. .. -... v - : :i
He was arrested last evening, about 9
o'clock, while on his way to the Orpheum
with a Mrs. Moore. He was taken at
once to the police headquarters, where he
was put through the sweating process,
while at the same time Mrs. Moore. John
D. Schloen, who keeps the grocery on
the corner of Ellis and Polk streets, and
David. Barney Tynes, a negro who
haunts that corner, were held for exam
ination.' .o'.,"*V, ;
The prisoner did not take particularly
well to the examination and at times be
came defiant and dared the police to do
their worst. He had but a hazy idea of
what he did and where he was Wednes-
Getz told the Chief he had not worked
in fourteen months. He lived on what hla
mother gave him. he said. She gave him
from a dollar to a dollar and a half
?very day and he made that do. He de
nied that he had any other place where
he lived besides his own home, I at 93) El-
Ii3 street. He said he was dressed on
Wednesday night Just as the Chief saw
him. gray clothes, blue linen shirt and a
white soft hat. Then he said he might
have worn a black Derby on Wednesday,
but he declared he did not own a soft
black hat. â¢ In this he was corroborated by
That was the sum of the facts bearing
on the case brought out J>y the examina
tion. There are some more points, how
ever, that seem to make It better for Getz.
The saloon keeper and Tynes declared pos
itively that on the day after the robbery
Getz had no more money than usual. Getz
was In the saloon at noon on Thursday,
and he had no money to show.
David Tynes, the negro, was in the sa
loon when Getz entered. He said It was
not 12 o'clock when Getz left the place,
and it was just after 12 when he left him
self. He slept in a neighboring basement
and heard the shot, but he did not think
it was any business of his. He had heard
Getz refer in one instance to holdins up
two men. but he believed Getz meant that
he would fight them. In addition he vol
unteered the information that he did not
think Getz could have been the robber be
cause he believed Getz to be a coward and
a man without grit enough to tackle any
one on the streets.
John Schloen, the saloon-keeper, said
Getz came into his place about half-past 11
and left again at about 11:43. At a quar
ter past 12 Schloen says he closed his
place and was in bed when he heard the
shot fired.
day night before the robbery, but he was
positive he was in bed at the time it was
commuted. He paid he was out some
where â he did not know where â with some
oneâ he" did not know whomâ and returned
to his home between 11:30 and 12 o'clock.
He said the reason he could not tell more
of his whereabouts was because he was
drunk. He denied that Mrs. Moore was
with him. although he afterward remem
bered that his companion was a woman.
Then he remembered that , he had gone
into Schloen's saloon before he went home
and also that he probably Â¦went out to the
park. Beyond these statements, the re
peated assertion that he knew nothing
of the hold-up and that he was safe In bed
at the time it happened, the examination
revealed nothing.
, The examination . of Mrs. Moore was
more interesting, for on two points she
contradicted Getz's story. She said she
was with him the night of the hold-up,
and also that when he left her about 11:30
o'clock he was sober. She did not know
where they went nor what cars they took.
All she knew was that he went to the cor
ner of Ellis and Polk streets with her
about half-past 11 o'clock and there hu
left her. He did not see her home. She
lives at 706 Ellis, which Is between Lar
kln and Polk, while Getz's house is be
tween Van Ness avenue and Franklin
street.

the fiancee of the victim, arrived yester
day and went immediately to the* bedside
of the wounded man. She was allowred to
remain in the sickroom, hut a short time,
owing to the precarious condition of
Itortzmeyer. Unless complications set in
there Is a fair chance of life for the ypung
man. Â»â¢ â¢ -*.-Â¦Â¦-.
So far the police have made little, prog
ress In their efforts to locate .the high
wayman. The two suspicious characters
now lodged in the tanks at the City Pris
on are George Neustadt and. Ovid Long.
Neustadt has not the best record, in the
world. He traveled around this city on
false representations sinde "his discharge
from the marine service after serving
two terms of imprisonment for desertion.
A year ago last JaniiafyVhe was arrested
in Oakland and a fewjjjionths ago came
before the attention of -the local police.
Ovid Long was"- occasionally employed
by A. B. Smith & Co. of 132 Ellis street;
That accounts for his possession of. the
taekhammer. He said. that Neustadt came
out to his house for a while on Thursday
evening and they walked -over to 'RHIs
and Polk streets to see where'the robbery
had occurred. Ovid claimed to bo a re
porter, hut the bluff was of no avail and
he was arrested. â¢â¢>-.".Â¦-Â¦ - ' Â¦Â¦â¢ . c
BORTZMEYER IS JOINED
BY HIS YOUNG FIANCEE
Vetsera maintains that he is of - high
family, and that he will keep the secret
of his* Austrian connections until he dies.
Chief Hcdgkins added that Vetsera said
he had held. up this trio thinking one of
them was a man. Had he known they
were all women he would not have mo
lested them.
Charles S. Green, librarian of the Free
Public Library, retold the circumstances
under which he was held up at Alice and
Thirteenth streets, hut he could not
identify Vetsera. The detectives and
Chief Hodgklns added their statements of
the confessions. Harris C. Allen gave his
testimony of the struggle with the young
highwayman.
Chief Hodgkins testified that Vetsera
said he had fixed the pistol so no cart
ridges could be exploded, as he did not
want to kill any one.
"I was so badly frightened." exclaimed
Miss Emma Biemann, who with Mrs. E.
Steddom and Miss Kate Bennett, were
held up on Boulevard Terrace, "that I
could not see anything but a dark-look
ing man and his pistol. His face was cov
ered as soon as he stepped out upon us.
We screamed and ran back to the. house.
1 could not Identify him." Mrs. Sted
dnm's evidence was similar. Miss Ben
nett was not asked to testify.
slons he volubly made concerning his
crimes in this city and in San Francisco.
He declined the services of an attorney,
and declared his only desire to be speedy
transportation to prison.
The three cases were heard most per
functorily, for there was qnly the legal
evidence necessary to prove reasonable
cause that Vet sera was guilty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. May Vâ This is Gov
ernor's night at the'earnival, and to prove
the high favor with which the elements
regard the statesman from the southland
rain water is running knee deep down the
carnival grounds, and men wearing high
rubber boots nre trying to rescue the ex
hibits from the deluge. On one memora
ble occasion In Rome, when Caesar, like
Gage; was about to occupy the theater of
public attention, the "cross blue lightning
seemed to open the breast of heaven" and
portentous things happened around the
imperial capital. The affinity between Ju
!,.J2 Â°, aesar and Gage might seem rather
difficult to establish, but the fact remains
that prodigies have appeared here to-day
such as to astound the most ancient in
habitants.
Governor Gage was to have ridden In a
hack to-night and bow his acknawledg
ments to the appreciative multitude, while
cannon boomed and loud huzzas rose from
the throats of the National Guard With
amazing disregard for this arrangement,
the skies flashed lightning this afternoon
and thunder roared over the city with
such force as to make the houses quiver
on their foundations. It was the severest
electrical storm Sacramento had expe
rienced in years. No sooner had It sub
sided than the very heavens seemed to
open, and for four or five hours the rain
fell in perfect torrents. A cloudburst
comd scarcely have brought about such
a scene of utter dejection. Most of thA
crossings were, soon made Impassable, and
they so remain to-night, the sewers being
unable to discharge the vast amount of
water running into them.
As a consequence, a man cannot walk
down the. carnival streets to-night without
rubber boots. None of the shows are
open, and vans and trucks are busy try
ing to rescue exhibits from the wet. With
a clear day to-morrow, however, it is
probable that the appearance of the, street
fair will be In a great, measure restored,
but Governor's day will descend in local
history as the dampest on record.
Much amusement was created by the
appearance this morning of one of the
'San Francisco papers with a solicited
statement from some of the, members of
the carnival committee thanking it for its
tremendous enterprise in maintaining a
"corps of writers- and artists" here dur
ing the fair, thus contributing to the ex
position's greater srlory. As a matter of
fact, the newspaper referred to has been
represented hero during carnival week by
a magnificent and versatile force of one
man. and his services to his paper, to the
fair and to the public have chiefly been
along the line of judicious scissoring of
the accounts in the local evening paper.
The Call is the only San Francisco paper
which has had an artist bore, and while
its pictures have admittedly been the only
good ones of the floral parade and Chinese
carnival yet published, it. has not impor
tuned the committee for a signed declara
tion to that effect.
To-morrow night will witness the'wind
up of the carnival. R*>x will hold sway In
the person of George W. .Tackson â the" se
cret's outâ and his chief functionary will
ho Frank E. Wright.' The new pavilion
will be the scene of festivities, and there
promises to baa. furious reign of fun.

GOVERNOR'S DAY
AT SACRAMENTO
A DAMP FAILURE
The State Bank Commission's work was
the subject of a paper by Commissioner
B. D. Murphy, who gave a list of the
banks of the State, their character, the
amounts on deposit, etc. He showed that
the deposits in the savings banks of Call*
fornia showed that the per capita is
greater than that of any State in the
Union, a fact on which the people should
congratulate themselves.
The convention adopted resolutions of
respect to the memory of the late James
Thompson, who was a prominent member
of the association. The following resolu
tion was also adopted:
Resolved, That the taxation of State, county
and municipal bonds, including Â«chool district.*.
Is without resulting benefits, but urolific of
evil, ns It occasions the loss of monry to tax
payers. d*r>reoiat*s publli: and private credit,
imp^lrd resr>ert for th<Â» law. and lessens the
public conception of the sanctity of an oath;
vhrr^fore the convention recommends that the
constitution of the State be so amended as to
exempt nubile securities from taxation.
Resolutions were adopted thanking those
who had addressed the convention, the
people of Sacramento for courtesies ex
tended, the Secretary of State for the use
of the Senate chamber and the press for
their' rcprtrts of the proceedings. The fol
lowing officers were elected:
President. M.i C. AltPchnl. San Francis

G. W. Kline: executive council. I. Stein
hnrt. A. II. R. Schmidt/ A. Goldstein. C.
W. Bush. J. R. Ryland and XV.. A. Hall.
The secretary's salary was raised from
ffÂ»O to $7"> per month.
To-night the members of the association
held a conference, and to-morrow they
will go on an excursion to Kolsom and
visit the State prison and the big electric
power and light plant on the American
River. .
Professor Carl C. Plchn of the State
University delivered an address on "Cali
fornia Methods and Systems of Taxation."
At the afternoon session John P. Irish
read a paper on the consular system of
the United States. He took the ground
that men should he specially trained for
that branch of the service, and that the
system should be divided Into groups, ac
cording to the character of the service
required. He spoke of a bill that was
yesterday introduced in Congress provid
ing for such classification of the consul
ates and training of men for the positions
thereunder. At the close of Mr. Irish's
remarks the convention adopted a resolu
tion commending the proposed enactment.
Professor Plenn of the State University
spoke on the foreign commerce of the Pa
cific Coast. He commended the Pacific
Commercial Museum and its work, and a
resolution was adopted by the convention
to that effect.

WHEATLAND, May 4.â An unusually
heavy ruinstorm visited this section this
afternoon.- Rain begun -falling about 2
o clock and continued until 6:30 p. m.. dur
ing which time 1.52 inches of rain fell.
Between 3 and 6 the precipitation was
lully a.n Inch. The weather Is still unset
tled and the prospect Is for more rain.
WOODLAND, May i.â The weather has
been showery for. nearly twenty-four
hours and as a result a great deal of thtt
hay crop has been seriously Injured. The
farmers are hopeful that the gain In late
sown wheat will offset the loss in hay.
SANTA BARBARA. May 4.â There has
been u steady rainfall since early this
morning. The precipitation amounts to
one inch here, some of the neighboring
valleys reporting as much as* 1.25 Inches
up to this evening. A good summer crop
is now assured.
STOCKTON. May 4.â During the past
twenty-four hours ending at midnight .75
of an inch of rain fell here. It is still
raining and the indications are that it
will continue falling for some hours. Just
15.15 Inches has fallen this season Grow
ing grain is greatly benefited. A good crop
Js ussured. Â¦ - .

and parts of Canada harder. The trees
in Ventura and Santa Barbara are in ex

prices for the fruit crop to be harvested.
SAX DIKGO, May 4.-Not since 1SS4 has
there been as much rain during a day in
May as that which fell here to-dav
Krom 11 a. m. until 7 d. m. there was 'a
heavy downpour, with only brief intermis
sions. Up to 5 p. m. the precipitation was
M. During the next two hours about
.25 of an inch fell. The rain will be of
immense benefit to the fruit ranches and
to late sown hay. Hay already cut is
damaged, but the quantity is- not large.
The storm was general In the back coun
try, but not'qulte as heavy as on the
coast.
; The beets at Oxnard have hern thriving,
the result of irrigation, and the rainfall
will not have the important bearing upon
operations there as is the- case at the
(Mark factory at Los Alamitos. The Chino
factory will not be operated this year.
Seven thousand acres are in beets adja
cent to the Los AlamltOS works.
The rain to-day has saved the corn crop
in its entirety and has done similar ser
vice for deciduous and citrus fruits in
Southern California and for beans In
Ventura. Loose hay iying out may be
somewhat damaged, but the good to other
products will make the damage, whatever
it may be. a s'mali matter.
* ho mountains are t. very whore covered
with snow, which assures an abundant
water supply for irrigation.
Apricots will he short this year owing
to ah unaccountable dropping of the blos
soms In the orchards throughout this end
of the State. The territory mo3t affected
As one or the results of the present
storm the sugar factories aV Oxnard and
Los Alamitos wjll both be operated dur
ing the coming season on full time. This
means that nearly $2,000,000 will from this
source atone be distributed in- and about
Los Angeles during the coming summer.
Had 'the dry weather continued the Los
Alamitos factory would probably not have
been operatcd-.this year at all. The lust
rain assured a partial crop of Ijeets and
the storm of last night and to-day guar
antees that a complete crop of beets will
be harvested.

which has affected Southern California
for the pas.t three years was broken at. a

ports from interior points show a much
heavier fall.

Hannah Burla. who died some five or six
years afterward, without issue, but leav
ing a small property to the widower.
â¢In the sixties he commenced to: climb
the.rugged hill to prosperity by establish
ing the now famous Pioneer sugar plan-*
tation at Lahaina, working in the fields
or in the mill as a common laborer, and
using a mule for the motive power for
grinding.
In the eighties Turton bought out
Campbell for $500,000, and while Turton
failed Campbell's pile increased, until
eventually he became the largest land
owner in the country. The vast Ilonou
liuli ranch, upon 'which is the Ewa plan
tation (and Pearl Jtfarbor), ! and through
which the railroad runs, was his. in
Honolulu he owned Improved real estate
of great value and had a large interest In
the First American Bank of Hawaii. In
California he also had large investments;
including the ownership of the St. James
Hotel at San Jose. It Is estimated that
his estate will be valued in the neighbor
hood of $3,009,000 at the very least.

whom .he had. eight children, four of
whom survive, the Misses Abigail and
Alice, who are at Notre Dame Seminary,
San Jose, and the; Misses Muriel and
Mary Beatrice, who are here.
It may now be announced that prior to
Mr. Campbell's illness a marriage had
been arranged between Miss Abigail

WIXNEML'CCA, Nev.. May 4.â The jury
in the Bouton case, after being out eigh
teen hours, brought In a verdict of guilty
yesterday afternoon. The crime for which
Bouton was tried was the stealing of fifty
three head of cattle belonging to the Mc-
Kissicks of Long Valley, California. Bou
ton. in company, with James Shaw, the

the penitentiary for forgery, brought the
cattle into Nevada and sold them- to
Henry J. Thies, a prominent cattleman at
Love-lock. Bouton was indicted ten times
for cattle stealing and was tried twice.
The cases have excited great interest in
the country* and will result in a political
issue between the cattlemen and the
friends of Bouton at the fall elections.

PAGO PAGO, Island of Tutuila, April 17. â The American Hag was raised over this port zvith
impressive ceremony to-day, and in an official manner was the fact proclaimed to the world that
the terms of the recent tripartite treaty Germany, England and America had gone into
effect.
The occasion was a gala one indeed, and was under the direction of the officers of the U. S. S.
Abarenda, Captain Tillcy commanding. An international aspect ivas lent to the affair by the* presence^
of the German warship Cormoran, Captain Emmsmann. The latter officer had invited all of the Amer
ican citizens at Apia to accompany him to Pago Pago, and a large number availed themselves of the
privilege. Governor Soft took an active part in the proceedings as well.
About 1000 natives from other islands besides Pago Pago and vicinity were present.
The actual ceremony of the flag raising was preceded by the reading of the treatv and the order
of the Secretary of the Navy by Captaui Tillcyr Thereupon the native? priests of Pago Pago conse- :
crated the flag before it was raised, performing a weird and unique but thoroughly impressive cercmonv.
As the Stars and Stripes were .in furled to- the breeze and quickly hauled to the polehcad by the
sailors of the Abarenda, there belched forth from the ship's cannon a salute of twenty-one guns which
whs follozved by a similar salute from the Cormoran., A native chorus from the London Mission
sang" America" in English and added two verses in Samoan. The ceremonies closed zvith several con
gratulatory addresses on the part of the native chiefs.
The remainder of the day was spent in all kinds of athletic contests held under the auspices of
the officers of the Abarenda. In the evening the prices zverc distributed. â¢
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON* HOTEL. WASHINGTON. May 4.â
The opinion pronounced yesterday by
Judge Loekran in the United States Dis
trict Court cf Minnesota that the Federal
constitution extends to Porto Rico ex pro
prlo vig-ore excites little interest here.
Public men generally do not care to dis
cuss the matter in the absence of details
of the proceedings in court and without
the full text of Judge Lockran's decision.
The constitutional question involved will
ultimatelyâ and possibly at the present
session of the United States Supreme
Courtâ be decided by that tribunal. Mean
while comparatively little importance i<*
attached to the decision of the Inferior
court. The Evening Time*= alone of the
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Question Involved Is One WMch
the Supreme Court of the -
ITation Must Pass
Upon.
Statesmen Attach Little Im
portance to Lockran's
Decision.
YET IN DOUBT
AS TO STATUS
OF PORTO RICO
After reviewing the facts of the case
the court said that according to the de
cisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States a military commission was
without jurisdiction to try a civilian in
United States territory in time of peace.
He considered Porto Rico territory of the-
United States and subject to the consti
tution the minute it came under the con
trol of this Government. Unless the con
stitution extended to Porto Rico In ad
vance of action by Congress. Congress
would have no power to legislate for the
island at all. because it has no authority
to legislate for any except territory to
which the constitution has extended.
. The decision was given in the case of
Raphael Ortiz, a Porto Rican, who Is
seeking release from the State Prison at
Stillwater on the ground that hla trial for
murder by a military court was unlawful
because as an American citizen he was
entitled to o. trial by jury. His applica
tion for a writ of habeas corpus Is denied,
however, on the ground that the island
was in a state of war before the ratifica
tion of the treaty when the murder was
committed and that therefore the mili
tary court had jurisdiction.
Washington newspapers comments on
Judge Lockran's decision. It says in part:
"The decision.. unless reversed, which
It will not be. makes the Payne-Foraker
law, with its carpetbag loot commission
and Its illegal taxation in the interests of
trusts, as valid In American territory as
a decree of the Ahkoond of Swat would
be. We are unable to say whether or not
quick appeal to the tribunal of last resort
will be possible. It is to be hoped that it
will, since it is manifestly unjust to leave
in technical suspense the political status
of Porto Kico, concerning which there is
in fact not a scintilla of doubt. The Su
preme Court will adjourn in June and it
is the determination of the administra
tion to prevent any test case from reach
ing -it before that adjournment and thus
postpone a binding decision until after the
Presidential election."

VICTORIA, B. C May 4.â John McGill,
who has reached Dawson after a hard
trip from Cape Nome, in a letter to his
mother, who is a resident of Nanalmo.
says many of the stampeders who have
gone down the river to Nome have suf

Rice who owns the two-story bulldlnir
opposite to where the steamer John Reilly

Mr. McGill says: "There are at least
two men living at Nome who know how
dead dog -.tastes, and that, too. without
pepper or salt to season it and make It a
little more palatable. These two who fed
on the malamutes they took along to haul

there was a party of seventeen on the

found their provisions getting low.
"When they struck the Fish River dis
trict they were in a very sore plight.
When they pitched their camp one night
there they found that they were entirely
without provisions, the last tin of flour
having been consumed. They sat around
the fire they had built, pretty glum and
scarcely knew what to do. Suddenly Rice
got up and plunged his knife Into one of
the malamutes. The dog was cut up and
eaten by the famished men. For day?
this was their sole food. One by one the
other dogs were killed and eaten by the
starving men In order to sustain their
lives. In all twelve of the dogs were
eaten before they at last reached a post

HOISTING OF OLD GLORY
IN PAGO PAGO HARBOR
Emperor William was clad In a gor
geous Austrian field marshal's uniform
of cream-colored coat,- scarlet trousers,
with broad gold lace and a black chapeau
with green feather?, and . wore Austrian
decorations. He drove down Unter den
LJnden to \ the station, accompanied
by his brother. Prince Henry, who
wore the uniform of an Austrian
admiral. His Majesty -was cheered by
the crowds all the way. The train bear
ing Emperor Francis Joseph arrived
promptly on time. The greetings be
tween the two Emperor's were most cor
dial; the monarchs embracing and kiss
ing each other on both cheeks. The Aus
trian Emperor wore the uniform of the
Prussian Foot Guards and across his
breast was a broad orange ribbon, with
the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle.
The procession passed through the
Brandenburg gate in the- following order:
A squadron of the Garde du Corps, in
black cuirasses arid helmets tipped with
silver eagles, preceding an open carriage
with magnificently attired outriders, in
which sat the two Emperors, flanked by
aid-de-camps. Then followed Prince
Henry and the Prussian Crown- Prince,
and next to them were the younger Prus
sian Princes. Then came the generals
and state dignitaries.
The absence of Prince Hohenlone, the
Imperial Chancellor, and the presence of
Clad in Scarlet.
BERLIN, May 4.â The standard of the
Emperor of Austria waved from the royal
palace in Berlin this afternoon, signify
ing that the ruler of the dual monarchy
has taken up his residence there. Em
peror Francis Joseph reached Potsdam
station punctually at 10 a. m. His Ma
jesty's reception was strictly according to
programme and the whole city was in
festal, garb. The route, especially Unter
den Linden, was crowded from daybreak
with eager and most good-natured sight
seers. There were no disturbances, the
police arrangements being comprehensive
in enforcing order and preventing dan
gerous crowding. Arriving spectators
after 8 o'clock were excluded from the
route, which was doubly flanked from
the Siege Allee to the Brandenburg gate
by the Berlin veterans' associations,
many graybcarded men wearing the iron
cross. The route from the gate to the
castle wj^s lined with troops.
The real hero of the day was the youth
ful Crown Prince, who followed his
father's carriage. The blooming youthful
ness of the Prince wan advantageously set
off by the dark uniform of the Guards*
which he wore. He was cheered all alone
the route quite as much as the two Km
perors, and the Bcrliners are all delighted
at the handsome, modest appearance of
their future King.

Both men were well played out when
they got together for the last round, but
Walcott still was the aggressor. Smith's
body was covered with blood and his face
was besmeared, while ' Walcott' s .black
body did not show a mark. . . .:
The Barbadoes negro's ; face - wore a

and was awarded thn decision. Â¦
Walcott scored first blood in- the sixth
round, when a right-hand smash opened
Smith's left eyebrow.. In the following
round Smith swung a heavy right on Wal
cott's Jaw, forcing him to clinch, but Wal
cott was fighting cleverly at the close
of the round. .
They mixed It up fiercely In the twelfth
and thirteenth rounds. Smith grew wild
in his delivery and at the . close-, of the
thirteenth 5 to 1 was freely laid on - the
negro. .
The fifteenth rc?und was in Smith's fa
vor, but in the sixteenth Walcott woke
up again and forced the pace. Fighting at
short range was the feature of the twen
ty-first round, and both . men " were very
tired when the bell rang. 1 Both men lost
their heads In the twenty-second. They
slugged each other regardless of science
and Smith had the call at the bell. Billy

In Italian greyhounds Mrs. Deane's
Queenie won the mt_al for the best in a
class where all were *ood. Following is a
full list of yesterdays awards:
Â»~il â HE third day of the bench show
;Â¦ pupasped the two preceding ones in
|l attendance, and possibly also in the
Interest that attached to the pro
ceedings. The whole of yesterday was de
voted to th*> awarding of the special
prizes, and the keenest Interest existed
omong the exhibitors and their friends,
and speculation was rife a? to the out
come of the competitions. A majority of
the special prizes offered were decided by
the win* in the winners' classes, this ap
plying specifically to the trophies for the
best of sex and breed, but those offered
irrespective of sex had to be decided by
renewed competition in the rinj?. Of these
latter those at the greatest interest to the
exhibitors and spectators were the cora
jittitionji In the St. Bernards, for the best
St. Bernard, the best of opposite sex and
the best bred on the Pacific Coast. These
were won, respectively, by Le Prince Jr..
Alta Rachel and Orion L, all thoroughly
well deserved.
The cockor spaniels were productive of
a numerous and interesting competition.
Much to the surprise of every one. the
hitherto undefeated Champion Havoc
went down in defeat before the redoubt
able Champipn Princess Flavia, who took
the special for the best cocker spaniels in
the show, and in blacks.
The contest for the special for the best
Boston terrier was the closest in the show,
and the judpe seemed to find great dif
ticulty in .arriving at a decision. The wln

BLUE-BLOODED CANINES
WREATHED IN RIBBONS
The long spell of racing will be brought
to a close at Oakland track this afternoon.
The California Jockey Club has generous
ly donated the day's receipts to the fund
o"f Fabiola Hospital of Oakland, and com
plimentary badges on this occasion will
not be honored.
Track Notes.
A bunch of twelve started in the fifth
number, with Cue played down to 13 to 5
favoritism. The one-eyed horse was away
poorly, eventually getting up in time to
llnish fourth. Coming Event led Into the
stretch, quitting .while apparently gallop
ing. Gusto, a 5 to 1 chance, with Ranch
In the saddle, then scored without effort
from Spike.
La Borgia, piloted by Stuart, took the
seven-furlong selling affair. Proclamation
and Romany headed the field for two
thirds of the route, when La Borgia grad
ually forged to the front, downing Dolore
and Sugden very handily. The winner
was a 5 to 1 chance.
Wyoming/second choice In the ring,
won the closing race. Lady Meddlesome,
the fast coming favorite, late in arriving,
lost by a head, with Silver Tone a close
third.
.W. L. Stanfield's filly Kitty Kelly ruled
a tepid-warm favorite for the first event,
with Mounce in the saddle. After Ahwah
nee had led to the stretch Powell astride
Flush of Gold went to the front, beating
the weakly ridden choice with ease.
Homestake, a 20 to 1 shot, ran third.
A flying start contributed to the win
of Lillie Ulggs in the two-year-old scram
ble, at four and a half furlongs. The
filly, with 15 to.. 1 about her in the ring,
sailed away first, winning in a Jog. Game
Warden finished second in front of the
heavily backed Screenwell Lake.
I About the severest jolting the talent re
ceived occurred over the result of the two
year-old spin, for which Rio de Altar was
backed down from 6 to 3. The JJaldwln
entry ran away twice* with Basslnger,
burning the money up. When finally dis
patched Andrattus beat Articulate out a
short head. Powell' on the favorite.
Grafter, rode a race that should have,
earned for him Indefinite suspension.
When Perseus, second choice for the
mile and a sixteenth run. looked to have
the race in hand. El Mido came from
sixth position, getting the verdict on the
last jump. It was a startling reversal,
thoroughly Investigated by the stand.
Trainer Johnny Campbell was exonerated
after the sheets had been carefully ex
amined.
The great big thing of the local turf
scandal has finally come off. As stated
exclusively In The Call of Thursday last,
the California Jockey Club is in possession
of information directly Implicating Willie
Martin, the most noted of America's
riders, . with more than one shady trans
action that occurred the past season, and
taking the ram by the horns ruled him off
the turf at a meeting held yesterday.
Martin piloted Elkwood to victory in the
"Suburban" of some years ago and his
astuteness has made him one of the most
talked about personages of the racing
world. Last year his name was mixed up
with some suspicious transactions on the
far Eastern turf, causing 1 the jockey club
to revoke his license. This latest ruling
will mean his final retirement. It Is to be
hoped the association across the bay will
continue Its missionary work and place
the name of "Danny" Lynch on the roll
with Martin. If the latter is guilty Lynch
is equally so, as a world of evidence can
attest. Lynch trained Hard ' Knot and
Martin bet on the colt when he came to
life. Without the trainer's information
the ex-jockey could not have bet on the
horse, and tnero's the case. t .
Not since the inception of the mefcting
in September last has the ring reaped
such a golden harvest, it being estimated
that the twelve bookmakers cleaned up
nearly $30,000 on the day's wagering.
Among the big winners were: George
Hose, ?4000; Barney Schrelber, $4300; Frank
Eckert. J3000; W. T. Barnett, $2000; Johnny
Coleman, JlsOO; Harlan & Co., $4000; two
books of Hoffman & Co., $4290; "Jim" Da
vis, $1000, and Gus Bluhm, $300. The first
choices were all laid to rest In the
trenches, the highest priced performer be
ing El Mldo. which made a successful de
scent from the clouds at 50 to 1.

STOCKTON SETS
THE PACE FOR
LEAGUE TEAMS
Its Baseball Team Leads in
the Race for the 9
Pennant.
Stockton now leads the teams in the
baseball league, with Sacramento in sec-
oud place. Both teams won their series
of games last Saturday and Sunday. The
hot race for first place is between the
Senators and the Slough City men, and
when they meet to-day and to-morrow
some fierce diamond sport should result.
The standing of the clubs at present is
more or less a surprise to the followers
of the sport, as both Stockton and Sac
ramento started with some unknown
players. Sacramento has to-day an ag
gregation of talent that would do credit
to any city. Last Sunday at Recreation
Park, with the great Hughes in the box
the team played lightning ball. Stockton
has a strong team, especially when it
comes to sticK work. The race up to date
is between the interior towns. The stand
ing of the teams is as follows:

OARSMEN IN TRAINING.
The State live-bird tournament under
rhe auspices of the California Wing Club
and the Olympic and San Francisco gun
clubs held Its opening day shoot yester
day at the grounds of the San Francisco
Trap-shooting Association at Ingleside.
In the opening event a high wind ac
companied by slight showers of rain af
fected the flying qualities of the pigeons
and the scores in consequence were disap
pointing. After lunch the weather con
ditions were more favorable for the shoot
ers and eleven of the twelve gunners
dropped their first birds.
J. Hops of Antioch won the medal in
the third event by a clean score. He was
not in on the division of the purse, a? he
; did not contribute to the side pool. Xau
1 man was unfortunate in this shoot. He
'shot at a fast flier and through breaking
both Its wings lost the bird by a few
1 inches outside of bounds.

Tho formal opening of the elghteen-hole
course of the Kan Rafael Golf Club will
take" place" next Saturday. In order to ex
cite-as much interest as possible among
local golfers, the directors of the San Ra
fae,l Golf Club have offered a cup, to be
competed for by teams of the San Fran
cisco and Oakland golf clubs in a tourna
ment over eighteen holes, match play. It
has not yet been decided of how many
men each team will consist, but the num
ber will probably be six or eight. It is
probable that K. H. Gaylord, the secretary
of the San Francisco Golf Club, will not
play, as he Is too busy with preparations
for his departure to Cape Nome to have
time for practice. Each club will have
much the same representatives as In the
home-and-horne tournaments. It will be
interesting to' see how the teams fare
when playing on neutral links.
With regard to what Is "permanent
srass," C. B. Mncdonald writes: "Turf is
certainly 'permanent grass.; and a club
may be soled on it in a hazard." Under the
new rules prepared by the United States
Golf Association turf must be considered
part of the fair green. High grass is not
a hazard, but. If In a hazard there should
be some straggling high grass, that would
be called part, of the hazard if it was not
permanent grass. Mr. Mncdonald goes on
to say: "'Hazards are now dearly 'defined,
except that in the United States the word
'hunker' is indiscriminately applied to all
hazards. In Scotland a bunker is a par
ticular-kind, of hazardâ that Is, a sandy
hollow." ' Â¦ -
i The links of the Belmont Golf Club at
tracted a large number of guests last Sat
urday. They were laid out by D. Stephen
son, the; professional of the San Franciaco
Golf Club, and have several ditches as
hazards. Fine views of the bay and of
Santa Clara County are obtained from
various parts of the course. The four
some between R.B. Wheeler and A. A.
Peters on one Fide and J. Kruttschnltt Jr
and E. J.. Boothc on the other resulted in
a tie.' " â . â¢> 'â¢
WHAT GOLFERS ARE DOING
The homing pigeons representing the
members of the Pacific Pigeon Club
showed wonderful speed In their first race
of the year on May 2 from Marysville.
The former record for the distance, which
is about 100 miles, air-line, was 1084 yards
per minute, made by a bird owned by
John Mole of East Oakland. In last
Wednesday's race representatives of
every loft in the race, with the exception
of one. beat the record.
A bird, the property of B. T. McBain,
Oakland, made such fast time that proper
arrangements for timing had not been
made and twenty minutes were consumed
in trying to catch him. According to the
officials of the club he covered the 90
miles 1060 yards In 2 hours and 14 min
utes, or at the rate of 1303 yards, nearly
three-quarters of a mile, per minute.
Adding the twenty minutes lost to his
time he was credited with only 1142 yards
per minute. The birds were liberated at
6 a. m. The ottlcial returns were:
Firstâ George Lubben's A4?0 arrived 8:24 a.
m.. distance 10O mile* 470 yards. Average spÂ«ed
per minute. 1237:57 yards.
Secondâ John Mole's W60S arrived 8:23:40. dis
tance 9S mlie* 13S0 yards. Average speed per
minute. 1I09:SO yards.
Thirdâ T. R. Quayle's BB546 arrived 8:26. dis
tance 99 miles 745 yards. Average speed per

RECORD FLY OF PIGEONS.
Pyne, center fielder for San Francisco
last year, played a single game In the
series between the local team and Stock
ton, holding down first bag for the
Slough City men. He was dropped this
season by Harris for not being a hitter.
At Stockton he rapped out a couple of
safe ones.
Cal Ewing and "Hank" Harris evidently
went wrong when they calculated on their
teams during the period of formation.
Ewlng thought he was organizing a nine
that would beat anything in the tleld and
Harris entertained similar ideas. They
reckoned without their host, for they now
hue- the lower end of the ladder.
This is the week for the tallenders to
disport themselves in the local field. The
Oaklands and Friscos struck the toboggan
last week, but they are no great distance
from the leaders. Nevertheless. Managers
Harris and Ewing are worried over the
prospect and it behooves their hired men
to pull themselves together and keep the
Sacramentos and Stocktons within strik
ing distance. The Interior teams are play
ing the fastest ball that was ever seen
in California, and "Uncle" Henry realizes
that he must get some new blood Into his
aggregation. Th* two teams representing
the bay towns never fall to Rive good ex
hibitions when opposed to each other, and
the coming series should be watched with
interest. The club that wln.s a majority
of the games will be once more fighting
with either Stockton or Sacramento for
first place honor3. The line-up for to-day
is as follows:
San Francisco. Positions. Oakland.
Schwartz..... Catcher Hammond
Fltzpatrick Mtrher Steffanl
McCarthy First base Hutchinson
Me-iily Second base '. Francks

William Isaac of 1165 East Fifteenth
street. Oakland, caught a twelve-pound
striped bass in Oakland estuary on May
day. The flsh measured three feet over
all.
Striped bass are running in Petaluma
Creek, two men securing forty pounds
there last Sunday.
The bi-monthly dinner of the San Fran
cisco Fly Casting Club will be held next
Tuesday evening. These affairs invarlably
attract almost the entire membership of
the club, as there is always something on
the programme of entertainment which
appeals to the anglers. On this occasion
Charles S. Wheeler, always an Interesting
speaker, will tell of the beauties of fly
fishing on the McCloud River, a stream
with which he is familiar from long- asso
ciation.
John Slebe, A. S. Carman and Edward
Everett left on Thursday evening for the
McCloud. They will go In over the Salt
Creek trail on the old-fashioned style of
"ride and tie." The three sportsmen and
their guide will have two saddle horses
and two pack animals. In the "ride and
tie" system one man starts off on horse
back, while his companion walks. After
the former has gone a certain distance he
dismounts and ties the horse to a conve
nient tree on a well defined trail. The pe
destrian comes up in due time, mounts the
horse and proceeds after his companion.
When he overtakes him he continues on
and gains a lead, when he dismounts, ties
the horse and trudges on. Between the
walking and the comparative rest of rid
ing the sportsmen are enabled to cover
a long distance in a day's traveling.
F. H. Reed left on Friday for Sims,
where he will enjoy for several days what
ever sport the Sacramento affords at that
point.
The trout fishermen have been unusu
ally quiet during the past week, the num
ber of well-known anglers on nearby
streams being comparatively small. Sis
sons and other points on the Sacramento
were deserted last Sunday. Up on the Mc-
Cloud the conditions are said to be per
fect, the river being In prime condition for
the men who fish wKh files.

ready for coursing as rapidly as possible.

The tirst annual meeting and election of
otneers of the caluornia Coursing Com
mittee will be held on the 22d inst. The
committee has proved a marked success
during the year of its existence in adjust
ing uisputes between dog owners and in
the mutter of registration. Its library ot
coursing calendars and stud books is a.
complete one. It is used irtely tor pur
posts of reference. The sport has as
sumed such proportions that the greatest
attention is paid to the breeding ot urey
iiounas, ail uad strains being eliminated
and only the. most approveu blood lines
being used In the stud. The winning
strains of English dogs have been drawn
upen heavily recently, an infusion of new
biotd being considered desirable.
Coursing men who have seen the six
week-old puppies by For Freedom and out
ot D. Cheliu s Golden Russet pronounce
them a promising lot. Mr. Chena retains
two, K. K. Malcom gets two and J. H.
Hossseier secures the remaining one.
At the regular monthly meeting of the
Interstate coursing Club the present rep
resentatives of the organization on tne
California Coursing Committee were re
elected. They are R. K. Malcom, E. E.
Shotwell, I. N. Halton. John A. Klein and
J. R. Dickson. The club accepted the re
port of tho committee having charge of
the ladles' day champion stake, to be de

The argument of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com

The Police Commission may be inspired after all
by a wise purpose in compelling patrolmen to wear

It will be seen that if these sections of the clause
stand they will come very near creating an indepen
dent government. If the Australian Parliament have
authority to make laws with respect to external af
fairs and the relations of Australia to the islands of
the Pacific it will necessarily have diplomatic freedom
in arranging treaties with foreign countries. Most
of the important islands of the Pacific arc under the
domination of some great power, and in arranging
relations with them the Australians would have to ar
range with the powers that control them, and that
would obviously be incompatible with' the manage
ment of the empire by the officials in London. '

In clause 53, for example, it is declared the Parlia
ment of Australia shall, subject to this constitution,
have power to make laws for the peace, order and
good government of the commonwealth with respect
to: (X) Fisheries in Australian waters beyond terri
torial limits. (XXIX) External affairs. (XXX) The
relations of the commonwealth with the islands of the

When the bill was first reviewed in London the law
officers of the crown objected to but one point, that
contained in clause 74, which provides that in all cases
arising under the commonwealth bill the jurisdiction
of the Federal Australian Court is final and that no
appeal can be taken to British courts sitting in Lon
don. It is asserted the clause limits the royal pre
rogative and virtually makes Australia a separate na
tion. Further discussion of the bill, however, has
disclosed other features adverse to imperial interests,
and some of these arc regarded as of more impor
tance than the qu-stion of appeals.
AUSTRALIAN federation, as expressed in the
terms of the commonwealth bill recently
adopted by the colonies and now undergoing
scrutiny by Parliament, is proving a much more per
plexing problem than was expected. Serious objec
tions have been urged against it by the imperial Gov
ernment, and the representatives of the colonies are
showing signs of irritation. It is evident there must
be a compromise or ? backdown on one side or the
other, and it remains to be seen which will give way.

THE MAYOR, THE STREETS flND THE
pOOTPADS.
r^v IRTV, dark and dangerous are the streets of
) San Francisco; more dangerous, dark and
dirty than they have been ever since first an
organized municipal government was established
here. They are so dirty that merchants, for the pro
tection of their goods, have to sweep and
sprinkle the public thoroughfares at their own ex
pense They are so dark during the hours when
lights are most needed that any one not thoroughly
familiar with his way must carry a lantern when he
ventures out, and so dangerous that even in the dis
tricts where the people are most law abiding he who
.- â¢ Â¦-Â¦Â¦-
goes out must go armed for the protection of his per
son and his property.
The darkness of the streets has generated crime
with portentous rapidity. Robber)' has followed rob
bery with startling frequency, and in more than one
instance that crime has been accompanied by attempts
at murder. One of the victims of footpad violence
now lies in a critical condition and may vet die of
his wound. The city, in fact, has been turned over, as
it were, to the mercy of the criminal class. The
streets are virtually theirs, and in the black darkness
they ply their trade with impunity, robbing whom
they will and shooting whoever resists.
For this condition of affairs Mayor Phelan is di
rectly and almost solely responsible. The people, de
ceived by his promises, granted him larger powers
than were ever before conceded to an official in this
State, or probably in the Union. He was permitted
to well nigh dictate a new charter, and he dictated it in
sr.ch a way as to clothe the Mayor with something
like autocratic powers in appointments and removals
from office. Of these powers Mayor Phelan has fre
quently boasted. He has more than once loudly pro
claimed that the heads of departments are respon
sible to him. and that he is responsible to the people.
It is his government. He controls, dominates, lords it
over all. He it is who has left the streets unswept and
unsprinkled. to be covered with dust and dirt. He it
:s= who has shut off the street lights, leaving the thor
oughfares in darkness as a free prowling ground for
thieves, burglars, footpads, thugs and assassins.
The inefficiency of the police to protect the city in
the darkness is evident, yet the force is not to be
blamed for the inefficiency. It is the Mayor, whose
policy has shut out the. lights and left even the most
vigilant policeman incapable of seeing what is going
on upon his beat, or of keeping watch upon sus
picious characters. It is the Mayor, in short, who, as
he himself boasts, is responsible for it alii
How much longer are the streets to be dirty, dark
and dangerous? How many more victims are to be
left to the footpads r.nd the murderous assailants of
the night? How much longer must the merchants
sprinkle the streets at their own expense? How
much longer must citizens carry arms for self pro
tection? These questions can be answered only hy
Mayor Phelan. The issue is up to him. The meaning
of the boast that all the heads of departments are re
sponsible to him alone, and that he is responsible
only to the people is now fully realized, and in that
realization the community will hold Mayor Phelan
accountable for all the injury and crime his blunder
ir.g policy has brought upon it.
It is hoped that the consulting roads will speedily
agree upon their policy/ in order that the important
and interesting questions raised may focus for ad
justment.
Has the Interstate Commerce Commission juris
diction over such a rate? If we deny that the com
merce is interstate, since it does not originate in one
State to be carried to o\ across another, we may
deny the commission's jurisdiction. But when we
consider the vast amount of freight of foreign origin
now carried as interstate commerce and subject to the
rating jurisdiction of the commission, there appears
an inextricable complication. It is the aspiration of
this coast to carry, control and distribute the Asiatic
trade at least until the Nicaragua canal is built. This
aspiration can only be realized by meeting the Suez
waterway rate by a transcontinental railway rate. It
is plain that if such railway rate is made the measure
of all transcontinental rates the roads cannot adopt
it. and if the rate on freight of American origin is
made the measure of the rate on freight of Asiatic
origin the trade will continue to go by the' Suez water
way.
A protest by the San Francisco wool shippers would
raise an issue that will be found very interesting.
It is obvious that we cannot get this commerce and
establish its distribution to continental points from
this coast unless the whole carriage and the rate om
the business are considered as units.
This purpose of the law imposes the issue that ap
pears in what the transcontinental roads are trying
to effect. If Asiatic commerce come and go this way,
instead of by the Suez canal, its rail mileage for inter
continental and Atlantic points is more than doubled.
It will constitute fifty per cent of the whole mileage.
In order to make possible the desired competition
with the Suez route this rail mileage must be had at a
lower rate on Asiatic than on domestic freight in the
same classification. For instance, the long clothing
wools of Australia and the carpet wools of Asia,
shipped from Port Adelaide or Macao, when loaded
on cars in San Francisco for Boston and Philadelphia
must be carried at a less rate per ton per mile than
the wools of California carried on the same trains
and between the same points. The rate from the
point of origin of the freight in Australia or Asia to
the point of destination must be considered as a unit,
though the carriage is part by water and part by rail.
The interstate commerce law is intended to enforce
equality of rates within the same classification and
This power to regulate was construed to mean the
jurisdiction of rates for transportation, but when the
question was raised as to the application of that_ con
struction to the freight rates on foreign commerce
doubts arose as to the soundness of the construction
it. c clf. As our commerce with foreign countries comes
in foreign ships, which under our treaties have the
right of entry and clearance in our ports, it was found
somewhat difficult to read the authority to regulate
into a power to fix the rates of freight at which for
eign ships shall bring cargoes to our port*. But the
Supreme Court has affirmed the constitutionality of
the power to regulate rates on interstate commerce,
and that part of the question is definitely settled.
The interstate commerce law, by which interstate
freight rates were taken under control by the Federal
Government, is based on that clause of the constitu
tion which Rives Congress power "to rtgulate com
merce between the States and with foreign countries."'
THE effort of the transcontinental railways to
unite in a policy toward Asiatic and Pacific
ishnd freights that will meet the Suez rate and
carry that commerce by the Pacific instead of the At
lantic coa?t raises some very interesting questions.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
In tha Massachusetts Republican platform the
plank referring to trusts says: "Such combinations
are the inevitable results oLthe sharp competition
which relentlessly enforces reductions of cost, and
are consequently an incident of prosperity; but the
evils which arise from them are not to be cured by
a return to adversity through the success of the
Democratic party. Such a remedy would be worse
than the disease." There may not be all the political
wisdom in the world in that declaration, but it is
good sound sense juÂ«t the same.
t-|t-3HE Railroad Commissioners began

road company with a violation of the law
In raising the fare between this city and
Fresno from $3 75 to $5 90 without consult
ing the commission. The railroad pleaded
in defense that the $3 75 rate was really
a second class rate, but that the passen
gers were given , first class . accommoda
ilons on it and that the $3 75 rate was
never other than a special excursion or
commutation rate, the purchaser being
limited to one train, without stopover
privileges.
Commissioners Edson. Blackstock and
Iiaumeister were all present." The plain
tin! was represented by Attorney Frank
H. Short of Fresno and Judge A. P. Van
Duzer for the State. Attorney John E.

The witnesses summoned were: John C.

examined by Attorrey Foulds as to
whether the Valley road was acting as
agent for the steamboat- company Mr.
Moss was saved from answering through
obiectlons Interposed by Attorney Short.
James Horsburgh. the next witness,
produced circular S6 of the Southern Pa
cific Company, in which agents of the
company were instructed to sell limited
tickets to Fresno for V- 75. the order tak
ing effect on August 1. 1W. This is the
order that was rescinded a few months
ago in vkJhtlon. it is claimed, of the State
law.
Horsburgh explained at the afternoon
session that the $5 9>) tickets were always
kept on sale and were the only tickets
that enabled passengers to ride on all
trains and which entitled them to full
stopover privileges. Attorney Short dem
onstrated, on the cross-examination, that
a passenger could buy a ticket to an inter
mediate point and from that point to
Fresno, and come away under the $5 90
rate. He said that no one except a lu
natic would think of asking for a J5 !Â»
ticket.
Attorney Foulds had Horsburgh explain
the various kinds of excursion and com
mutation tickets used by the company.
John T. Moore and W. T. Mattingly tes
tified that when purchasing tickets whÂ»n
the $3 75 rate was in vogue they were
never offered other than a $.1 75 ticket.
The hearing will be continued at 9:30
o'clock this morning.
John Moss was the first witness. He
testified that the Valley road was com
pleted to Bakersfleld in June. IMS. but the
rate from Fresno to Stockton was put in
effect a year earlier. A ticket from
Fresno to Stockton had a coupon attached
which gave the passenger a free* ride on
the boat to San Francisco. When cross-
Attorney General Ford was present
when the hearing opened and said that he
approved of the proceedings and that he
would stand ready to advise the board on
questions of law that might arise. The
reading of the complaint came next, and
then a general denial of the charges by
Attorney Foulds, who said that the v al
ley road never was a competitor of the
Southern Pacific, but that it had only
acted as agent for a steamer line from
Stockton to this city and was therefore
not a common carrier. Foulds then out
lined the defense as given above.
When Moore was introduced* as a rep
resentative of the people of Fresno Foulds
became excited and denied trmt Moore
came before the commission in any other
capacity than that of a private citizen,
who claimed to have suffered at the hands
â¢of the company in one particular instance.
He also objected to \V. T. Mattingly. who
was, however, permitted by the board to
present a petition -from the people of

It would be a profitable and beneficial act for Con
sul Ho Yow to meet'with the Merchants' Association
of this city and discuss the effect of these frauds upon
the mutual commerce of the two countries. It is re
ported that Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese Minister at
Washington, is about to return home. He is one of
the best equipped diplomats in the corps at our na
tional capital, a man of great intelligence, who speaks
our language perfectly. When he comes to San
Francisco this case should be laid before him, that
he may carry home to his Government the facts and
urge it to co-operate with ours in securing to Chi
nese the rights they have under the law by denying
those rights to all for whom they are not intended.
It can seek no better way to do this, and to pro
tect its own people lawfully domiciled here, and to
banish an American prejudice which is a bar to proper
and profitable commercial relations between the two
countries, than by putting an end to the unlawful
traffic of its own subjects in the flesh and blood of
their countrymen.
But while such pursuit and exposure and, if pos
sible, punishment, are duties of our people and our
Government, China has a heavy responsibility. It is
well known that the Chinese Government can easily
prevent the initiation of these frauds in China. That
Government desires to maintain relations of amit>
with the western world, and especially with tha
United States.
In saying this we by no means acquit of responsibil
ity the American officials who by carelessness or cor
ruption aid the frauds of the Chinese. They shoull
be pursued relentlessly until their ignorance or their
preed is cured or they are replaced by others who are
neither ignorant nor corrupt.
Intelligent Chinese and Americans alike lament the
constantly existing and, progressive prejudice against
the Chinese people. But all must tee that the Chinese
themselves are to blame (or it.
It is the odium of Chinese administration that these
dishonest evasions occupy the time and attention of
the executive and judicial officers of this Government.
We have reciprocal rights under the treaty with
China, but neither our people nor our Government
puts reciprocal burdens upon the administrative of
ficers of China. If we go there at all it is to obey the-
Chinese law?, not violate them.
We have no desire to be the means of excluding a
single individual of the Chinese race who has a right
here under the treaty and the law. We warn all such
that their worst enemies are their countrymen and
American officials and attorneys who abuse the privi
leges of the law to land those who have no right to
come. The Chinese Government, the Consul General
here and the Minister at Washington should see
this and procure the co-operation of their Govern
ment with ours in stopping this illegal immigration,
which is not only evasive of the lawj a breach of the
national faith of China and a menace to the peace
of Chinese lawfully here, but a distinct damage
.ind harm to those who have a right to go and come
freely as members of the non-excluded classes.
These cases, like those of the native sons, should be
sent to the courts for judicial examination. The mer
chants' wives who apply for admission should also be
sent to the courts to prove their right to land. '
THE CALL has furnished ample information on
the subject of the importation of Chinese
women. The identification of the different
classes which apply for admission is easy, and at once
settles their status and determines the purpose of their
importation. The Chinese traders in this stock un
derstand all this perfectly. Their coaching lessons
are planned with a view of falsifying the classification
of women. But it is not difficult to overcome this fal
sification, since the immobility of the population in
China differentiates that people and fixes upon each
class and the people of each province certain unmis
takable characteristics. The distinction of the boat
people from the land dwellers requires no sorcery.
The trick of the Chinese importers of human chattels
is to coach the boat women so that they appear out
of their class. In the lesson prepared for the spurious
native daughter, Wai Ho, it will be seen that she was
taught to declare that her mother was a bound-foot
woman, which places her in the upper class among
her people. But there is a peculiarity in dialect and
other particulars which should be easily detected that

One of the Australian statesmen now in London,
Mr. Walter Griffiths of Western Australia, is quoted
as- having given the 1 British this warning:; "The de
sire for national unity in the colonies is so strong and
self-reliant that any false step now made postponing
or imperiling the measure. may result in a movement
for the. formation of an Australian republic." .The
warning can hardly be-passed over as an idle threat.
The Australians carefully considered the meaning. of
every clause in their commonwealth bill- when they
drew it up and ratified it.. It represents their convic
tions and their desires concerning their, government,
arid if it be incompatible with the empire so much
the worse for the empire. Certainly the empire will
gain nothing by trying to force itself upon Australia
at this time.
colonies object' strongly to any amendment to the
bill. A hard fight and a long fight was required to
get the bill adopted by the people, for local pride,
prejudice and patriotism are strong in the colonies
and federation is a new- scheme, and therefore has
against it all the forces of conservatism. If the pres
ent bill be materially changed it is by no means cer
tain the. colonies Would adopt it in the amended form,
and thus all that has been gained for federation would
be lost. For that reasojithc Australians ask for a
ratification of the measure as it stands, and promise
that the loyalty of the colonists will prevent any dis
integration of the empire.

Teachers and Pupils Testify Prin
cipal Was' Punctual in Discharge
of His Duties. .
The trial of Principal Kllpatrick of the
Business Evening School was resumed
yesterday morning In the rooms of the
Board of Education. Testimony favor
able to the accused was given by several
teachers and pupils. C. H. Anker of the
Spanish class testified that Kilpatrick
had advised the pupils regarding a trip
to Yosemlte and had suggested to them
that they could make up part of the ex
penses by soliciting Insurance which he
would place for them. The pupils were
to have the entire management of the af
fair and Kllpatrick was to handle none
of the finances. Miss Jean Cooke. an
other teacher, had attended several meet-
Ings called by the defendant in the inter
est of the Yosemlte outing. Kllpatrick
had never advised the pupils how to get
Insurance. Albert Turner, a pupil, stated
that he had procured $500 worth of insur
ance, but that Kilpatrick had not placed
It. Angelo Byrne. Frank D. Strlngham,
Albert W. Lyser and Marlon Blanchard,
teachers In the school, testified that they
had never known Kllpatrick to be absent
from duty and that the insurance scheme
had never been carried out. A. Lind
strom. proprietor of a bathing house,
said that he had never known Kilnatrick
to be drunk in his place and he had never
conducted himself In an unbecoming
manner In the bath house. Thomas W.
Large, who was once janitor of the
school created some amusement when he
testified that he had locked the outer door
on the School Board so the â¢ members
could not enter the school. He said that
Kilpatrick was always punctual -and at
tentive to his duties. 'Kllpatrick was put
on the stand in the evening and denied
all the charges brought against him.

which shut her off from the world of the
senses, forced her to concentrate her pow

of its singularly Imperfect dwelling.
At the age of 20 Harriet Martineau be
came entirely deaf. She met this afflic
tion with the same cheerful strength
which characterized every- trial of her life,
and immediately resolved never to ask
her friends to repeat an observation lest
she should thus make them sharers In the
irksomeness of her misfortune.
Harriet Martineau made three literary
ventures before she was well launched
upon the stream of literary popularity
down which she afterward sailed so
swiftly and so smoothly. A.\ hen her
brother James, afterward the celebrated
Dr. Martineau, went away to college he
advised' Harriet, his student comrade, to
beguile his absence with authorship. Mie
was then but 19. apd with her usual tlmor
ousness -told no one of her trial article.

which she sent anonymously to the
Monthly Repository, a Unitarian maga
zine. \Vhen the oldest son dropped in the
following Sunday to read to the family
the best thing that the paper had printed
for a long time Harriet was covered with
confusion to recognize her article as the
subject of her brother's praise. The reader
was so Irritated that HarriPt did not join
In the family chorus 6f approval that she
1 was obliged to confess having written the
: essay, whereupon her kindly brother, lay
ing his hand upon her shoulder, said
gravely: "Now. dear, leave it to other
women to make shirts and darn stock
ings, and do you devote yourself to this.
A few years later the father died, worn
out with" business cares, and each of the
family was thrown on his own resources.
As Harriet was too deaf to teach she be
came an expert needlewoman, stitching
far into the night and occasionally
stretching her wings as an author. She
enjoyed surmounting obstacles and fre
quently referred to this period of pro
digious work as delightful, in that It re
vealed to her her capacity for work and
her powers of endurance. She frequently
supplemented her needlework by writing
until 2 or 3 In the morning, receiving but
Â£15 a year for her contributions of es
says book reviews, poems and devo
tional exercises to the Monthly Reposi
tory. .â¢..;-
Her second important literary venture
was her submission of three essays to
the Central Unitarian Association. This
body had offered three prizes of 10. 13 and
*>0 guineas each for the best essays on
the presentation of Unitarlanlsm to Jews,
Catholics and Mohammedans. Always
fond of theology. Harriet determined to
try for all the prizes, and accordingly
took every precaution to prevent the dis
covery that the three essays were by the
same hand, even going so far as to have
the first treatise, to which she devoted
â¢ a month's time, copied by a poor school
boy. Although there were many learned
competitors. Harriet, to her great aston
ishment, gained every prize.
Her third notable experiment does not
read so much like a fairy tale, for there
were too many refusals, snubbings and
hard bargainings such as assail more
ordinary mortals to make the effort a de
light These obstacles once surmounted,
however. Harriet MartlnÂ«-au found her
self seourely seated on the front benches
of fame from which she could successful
ly survey the literary turmoil of the less
successful. Thenceforth she had only to
choose the most congenial of the num
berless literary offers which constantly
assailed her. The work which thus as
sured her literary reputation was a series
of tales illustrative of the principles of
political economy. They were gpnerally
refused by cautious publishers, fearful of
the experiment of diffusing knowledge In
the garb of fiction, many averring that
the public was too much agitated by
the cholera and the reform bill to con-
Rider anv new departure, causing the In
defatigable Author to exclaim that she
was as heartily sick of the, reform bill aa
William IV himself. Through all these
discouragements she felt convinced that
her work was needed, and saying con
stantly to herselt. "My book will do yet!^
she pressed on. In ppite of the "Noes"
that were constantly shouted into her
ear trumpet."
A bookseller finally offered to take the
work upon the unpleasant condition that
the author should fln>t secure 500 sub
scriptions for the book. Any one Hse so
deaf and so obscure, would have recoiled
from such a proviso: buJ. nothing daunt
ed shu sent a prospectus to each mem
ber of Parliament, nnd In three weeks
the sale of her stories had run to 5000
copies and the author had no further care
about money. These stories, aside from
their great merit of disabusing tho pub
lic mind of Hie impression that science is
too deep & too recondite for the ordinary
intellect." possessed an all-absorbing In
terest regarded simply as stories. Her
faith in these and tubsenuent efforts led
many to misunderstand her sure, percep
tion of the pu,bllc needs for a remarkable
egoism. She was sHf-centered naturally
from the nature of her affliction and frÂ»m
the constant proof which she received of
her correct reading of public necessity;

one to whom that happens at 30 years of

Two years after she sailed to America,
to recuperate from the prolonged strain
of writing thirty-four volumes In about
two and a half years. During her two
years' stay in this country she studied the
institutions of the people. She seemed tiÂ»
gain a clearer Insight than u*oes the aver
age hasty traveler, and the results of her
observations are not so derogatory as
those of the superficial tourist. In her
volume "Society in America" she ad
vances the theory that the Americana
may always be trusted to do the right

manuscript of her other work on America
(called "Retrospect of Western Travel )
was presented in 1S0C to the Drexel Insti
tute of Philadelphia by Mr. George W.
C One S 'of her greatest accomplishments
was her translation and condensation of
the "Philosophy of Aususte Comte. Her
simplification of this rather verbose work
was so successful that it was translated
back into French and used as a textbook
of positivism, while the original work had
merely a curious value for libraries and.
bibliopolists. Meanwhile Harriet Mar
tineu twice refused a Government pension,
preferring to support her blind mother
and intemperate brother by her own ex
ertions to receiving from the Government
money which she had. not earned.
A few years later she built hcraelf a
cozy graystone cottage at Ambleslde.
where she worked indefatigably. cheered
My the congenial society of Wordsworth,
Emerson. Coleridge. Macready. feouthey.
Lytton. Hallam. Landseer and a host of
other bright minds. She enjoyed above
Ell things a duel of wit with the Inimitable
Sydney Smith, whose voice she declared
"sounded 'ike the great bell of St. Paul s
and made the use of her ear trumpet quite
unnecessary. Hawthorne said of her con
versational powers:
"She is the most continual talker I ever
heard. It Is really like the babbling of m.
brooK. and very lively and sensible, too: and
all the while she talks she moves the bowl of
her ear trumpet from one auditor to another, so
that It becomes quite an organ of intelligence
between her and yourself."
When not writing accounts of her trav
els in the Orient, a history of the thirty
years' peace or fascinating story books
for children she was exerting a most prac
tical neighborllness in her community.
She most generously placed her valuable
private library at the disposal of all who
asked organized building societies and
mechanic Institutes, to which she gave
free courses of lectures upon sanitation,
the constitution of the United States, the
Crimean war and current topics. She dem
onstrated her theories by building self
supporting workingmen's cottages and by
giving her poorer neighbors practical evi
dence of the way in which a farm or two
acres may be made to pay.
Meanwhile she had received an unusual
offer for a woman, vix.. that of writing
"leaders" for the Daily News, a large
London newspaper. For this paper alone
she wrote 1W2 editorials, by many consid
ered the most Influential part of her life
work, feho so molded public opinion that
to her largely belongs the responsibility
of England's position during our late Civil
War. "Harriet Martineau alone," declared
W. E. Forster. "was keeping our country
straight in regard to America."
Because her books were such marvels
of clearness and cleverness, not classic,
but the result of a trained mind gifted
with instantaneous insight, and because
of the masculine order of her work, many
have accused her of bavins a passionless
intellect. The great number of friends

Later the customs authorities stepped In
and told Captain Small that he could not

The Tariff on Tea to Be Advanced, but

Per Cent. â¢
The trans-Paciilc conference finished its
labors yesterday after having accom
plished much and having come to a gen
eral understanding that will likely lead to
other conferences and further agreements
concerning rates across the Pacific.
The most important outcome of the
meeting was the agreement of all the
lines to allow a differential of one-half of
a cent per pound on silk to the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha and the California and Ori
ental Steamship Company. These two
companies contended that they were the
weaker lines and refused to come to any
agreement without the concession were
made. Otherwise the several lines agreed
not to disturb the present rate on silk,
which is ?6 per 100 pounds to common
points in the United States.
The onlj" rate advanced was on tea, in
which there was great rate cutting and it
is claimed a considerable loss annually to
everv line. Tea has been carried to com
mon* points in the United States as low
as 60 cents per 100 pounds. The new rate
agreed upon is $1 50 per 100 to common
points, with the proviso that during tho
season of heavy shipments by mutual con
sent the minimum rate shall be made
51 25.
The only rate changed on outgoing car
goes was on paper, which it was agreed
to reduce from $1 to 80 cents. It was
agreed to permit all other rates to re
main as at present.
The freight conference has adjourned
5ine die. but the passenger men will not
get through until to-day. They are now
discussing steerage rates, which, it is
claimed, are considerably lower from the
Orient to Puget Sound points than to this
citv. The companies with terminals at
thfs city are trying to get concessions
from the Puget Sound lines that will put
them on a more even footing in securing
steerage business.

Harriet's father, a wealthy bombazine
manufacturer, gave all of his children an
unusually liberal education, but neither
he nor his wife seemed to possess the key
to the idiosyncrasies of child nature. Con
sequently their daughter Harriet, whose
senses were phenomenally dull and whose
nervous temperament was arbitrary
and inexplicable, suffered a loveless child
hood from which the true child spirit was
conspicuously absent. After reading her
graphic autobiography Thackeray ex
pressed the whimsical regret that Harriet
Martineau should not have chosen lier
parents more wisely. This autobiography
teems with tales of unaccountable fright,
induced by her dullness of vision and men
tal perception; absence of the sense of
smell, and an incurable defect in her
Harriet Martineau, whom N Lord
Brougham called "the little deaf woman
at Norwich," did more to mold public
opinion than many of her contemporaries
whoso writings have proved more valu
able to posterity. Her Huguenot ances

cation of the edict of Nantes, and the in
dependence of spirit which had caused
them to become refugees in the seven
teenth century caused their descendants
to become Unitarians in tho nineteenth
century.

NEW YORK. May 4.â Bradstreet to-morrow
will say: A further subsidence of demand and
leveling of prices Is noted in several lines this
week, this process being no doubt aided by the
unsettling effect of the rather more than
usually disturbed conditions In labor circles
The net result is something approaching dull
ness in many channels of distribution in
creased conservatism In the making of 'ven
tures and a disposition to digest business al
ready arranged for before making new engage
ments. That the basic conditions of general
business, â¢ such as the outlook for the crops
the export demand and the Increased purchasing
power of the people at large, have not been
much reduced, but on the contrary actually im
proved, seems evident from the advices re
ceived this week. Business at wholesale Is rel
atively quieter, which is not ' unusual at this
period, but more than ordinarily marked atten
tion is being concentrated upon the retail de
mand, which is, of course, relied . upon - as a
measure of proof of actual consumption. Touch-

NEW TORK. May 4-The stock market
maintained lu narrow and professional char
acter to-do y. As though to vary the appear
ance of recent monotony the upward movement
was continued to-day Instead of starting in
the opposite direction. But this was hardly
more than a device of the email traders to
rive an appearance of etrength to the market
nn<J their realizing: ealeu before the close
brought prices back to last night's level and
left changes Jnt!gr.iflcant except in a usually
active stock. Sugar retained Its relative prom
inence though oa a decreased volume of deal-
Ings. It was lifted above yesterday's close
once or twice with difficulty and the losses
were- about a point fcr the day. Long Island
ran off 3*,. seemingly on realizing on the sign-
Ing by the Governor of the bill authorlzlnâ¢
the construction cf e. bridge at Hell Gate, but
late dealings In the stock secured a rapid re
covery of 44 points. The steel stocks showed
nomc rather languid evidence of positive
rtrength without any particular news to "ac
count for it beyond the published opinion of

ing thai the present low stocks in the vards

CHICAGO, May 4.â Wheat opened lower on,
weak cables. For a time the trade was dull
and prices firm, receding a bit from first
figures. At the decline the cash demand
showed up in encouraging form; chinch bugs
were reported from Tennessee and TexaÂ« and
consideration was given the liberal side of
clearances, both weekly and for to-day. Under
the Impulse derived from these considerations
the market rallied and the close was firm.
The demand for May placed that option at l',ic
discount under July. July closed ".ic higher at
67%Â®67%c
Corn was easy to begin with and decidedly
weak during the middle of the session. Cables
were lower and freer country offerings were
reported. Business In the pit was fairly active.
Later In the session the wheat strength had
some effect, and this, combined with buying by
an influential bull, caused a rally, the close
being firm. Reports ' concerning the shipping
demand were conflicting, some claiming that
It was goodâ others to the contrary. July
closed firm, %c up.
Oats were quiet within narrow limits, af
fected throughout in a modest Â¦ way by the
corn fluctuations. July closed a shade down.
Provisions mnlntalned their firmness, but
made no particular gain In prices. Trade was
dull the greater part of the session. July
pork closed 2%c higher and ribs 2Vic down.
EASTERN MARKETS.
It would appear that large interests are firmly
holding railroad securities In large blocks, with
a view to a . further advance in all Income
yielding stocks when the liquidation In Indus
trials has spent its force and the expansion of
the circulation has its due effect on money rates
and the financial situation throughout the coun
try.
A further diminution of activity and falling
off in the public's interest and participation in
speculation were the features of the stock mar
ket thlt. week. The volume of transactions was
small and would have been almost Insignificant
but for the manipulation which has kept up In
American Sugar and the somewhat similar pro
ceedings In Missouri Pacific. Apart from the
above the principal noteworthy circumstance
was the continued heavy tone of the Industrials
and the readiness of the steel stocks In partic
ular to cell off, either on liquidation or bearish
attacks. But for the covering of short con
tracts there would seem to be but little support
in that portion of the market, and the adverse
Influence of the Industrials of course again
aided In creating a weak tone in the j railroad
rhare list, except where manipulative support
was extended. There were no declines of great
consequence, however, and the market was com
paratively Indifferent to the , engagement and
shipment abroad of $2,600,000 gold. Money Is
easy, and the steady Increase in the national
bank circulation under the new financial law
just reached the conclusion that the transfer
of a certain amount of gold to London and
Paris this spring will have no bad effects on
the situation here. The London market. It may
be observed, is In a state of Inaction closely
resembling what prevails here, and the gold
shipments, troubles among Industrials and sag
ging of the railroad stock list have checked the
foreign disposition to buy American stocks.
The European participation in the market here
was accordingly much smaller this week than
for some time back, and represented as much
selling as purchasing, the Influence therefrom
being on the whole adverse to our market.

WHEATâ Paris continued to shade off. Chi

and an estimated decrease of 2.CCO.O0O bushels
In the American visible supply. Corn was weak.
Later on in the session the market became
firmer and a shade higher, but there was more
disposition to buy, even at the advance. The
cash demand was a bullish feature, the other
markets leading. Corn rallied on liberal buy
ing by Cudahy.
In the local market futures opened lower,

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
NEW YORK, May 4.â R. G. Dun & Co.'t
weekly review to-morrow will say: Failure
statistics for April are especially valuable be
cause they show that there does not exist in
the most important branches of business the
conditions which threaten disaster.
They call attention to one line In which some
curtailment had seemed from previous returns
to be In progress, which has been hastened by
extensive strikes in the building trades.
The state of business has been represented to
fit and used to : support several hundred theo
ries already. The simple fact is that some
reaction from the abnormal excitement and ex
pansion and rise of prices last year was nec
essary to continued prosperity. Its duration
may. therefore, be expected to depend upon
the promptness with which production and
prices adjust themselves to actual demands.
Much progress In that adjustment has been
made during the past week with increased
activity already resulting. Strikes springing
from disputes about the terms of work and
wages for the coming year have also made
distinct progress toward settlement.
The reduction In prices of Iron and steel and
their products has gone far enough to bring
out much new business. At the end of last
week cut nails were reduced 45c per keg and in
plates and bars somewhat lower prices have
been reported. Prices sheets have not yet been
named, but In pipes and tubes there Is some
yielding with larger business In fence and other
wire since the reduction. Not a sale of Besse
mer pig is reported, that association still ask
ing- $24 SO, while Eastern pig is offered at Pitts
burg below $23, and local forge is lower at $20,
with Eastern at $19 75. Chicago local coke has
declined 50c and Southern also. Eastern mar
kets are Irregular with a growing belief that
an output exceeding consumption will reduce
prices until the demand again expands. There
are large foreign contracts for pig pending,
and important Bales of finished products for ex
port have. been made. It helps toward better
adjustment that coke Is quoted $1 per ton lower
than a month ago and antnraclte coal has aiso
declined.
The close of the wool year has come without
the scarcity which some expected, but with the
average of quotations by Coates Bros, reduced
in April about lc. Sales have been small and
yet much in excess of purchases for consump
tion.
The market for goods, excepting the most fa
vored staples, has been so far unsettled and
Irregular as to give small encouragement for
buying wool at current prices. Interior holders
are still strong, hoping that the end of the
season brings the end of manufacturers' stock.
Cotton goods have also shown similar weakness
in transactions for future delivery, and new
business Is narrow.
April exports of breadstuffs have been large,
both wheat and corn surpassing last year's
record. Atlantic exports of wheat In five weeks,
flour included, have reached 11,080,903 bushels,
against 10.744.798 last year. Pacific exports
3,513,250 bushels, against 2,090,737 last year.
Corn exports 150,573.337 bushels, against 12,090,
747 last year. In 6plte of conflicting stories the
movement of wheat from the farms continues
larger than a year ago. Â¦ The price closed as it
opened, while corn declined 2c.
All exports from New York In four weeks
have been 33.4 per cent, over $11,000,000 larger
than last year, and with the gain of $15,000,000
in cotton lrom other ports the month's aggre
gate for merchandise should rise above a hun
dred millions. Imports show a small gain,
but will hardly exceed seventy millions.
Failures for the week have been 209 In the
United States, asalnst 158 last year, and 27 In
Canada, against 23 last year.
Flour shipments this .wtÂ«k are very large.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,537,022 bushels, against 3.S63,
863 bushels last week, 3.8S4.0S1 In the same
week of 1899, 2,923,775 bushels In 1S38, 1,739,322
bushels in 1897 and 1,SS2,718 bushels In 1S96.
For the week failures numbered In the
United States 153, as compared with 1S2 last
week, 164 In this week a year ago, 240 in 1S9S,
22S in 1S97 and 267 In 1S96.
Failures for April in the Dominion of Canada
were fewer than <n April a year ago, but lia
bilities were nearly 15 per cent heuvier.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been three arrivals of coal from
Washington, 97fiO tons; two from Oregon. 955
tons: two from British Columbia. 6373 tons; to
tal, 17,:S8 tons. This Is considerably less than
we consumed this week, still there is no ap
parent scarcity, as the generous deliveries for
several weeks past have caused an accumula
tion. No change of values: prices remain sta
tionary, and have not varied for several months
past. The fearful disaster this week at a Utah
colliery, where so many colliers were killed,
will force the Southern Pacific Company to
draw from their reserve of fuel at this end. as
the Pleasant Valley mine was one of their inte
rior supply points. The first American anthra
cite coal ever shipped to Russia Is now being
loaded for Cronstadt. Large quantities of bitu
minous are being contracted for. deliverable In
France and Italy. America now holds the fuel
supremacy of the world, as her output this year
will be greater than that of Great Britain, thus
the sinews of peace as well as war are now
uncftr our control, which will prove a most suc
cessful adjunct in future years. Australian
coal freights show no change; in view of fu
ture grain rntes they should be cecllning some
what, and they certainly would if It were not
for the brisk demand for coal tonnage for Hon
olulu, which does not relax at all, from last re
ports."

327 Sixth st.Ross Jury Out.
Special DlMiatch to The Call
SAN LUIS OBISPO. May 4.â The argu
ments in the Ross murder case closed at
11:30 this morning. The Judge read the
charge to the .Jury, since which the jury
has. been deliberating with no verdict.
THE explosion of a mud drum at
tached to one of the boilers of the
San Francisco Power Company's
plant cost the life of James Shea,
one of the firemen employed at the plant,
yesterday morning.
The boiler was one of four from which
the company furnishes power to various
factories in the vicinity. The four boilers
are run night and day, and every Sunday,
according to Ira Bishop, manager of the
company, all of them are thoroughly ex
amined and tested. Last Sunday," he says,
they were tested and nothing was found
to be out of order or needing repair. The
steam pressure generally carried by the
boilers is 2<Xt pounds to the square inch,
and the boilers were at that pressure
when the mud drum blew out. The mud
drum is a cylinder twelve inches in diam
eter and perhaps six feet long, that
stretches under the boilÂ«r and catches the
mud and sediment that settles from the
water being boiled. It is attached to the
boiler with eight or ten pipes about four
inches in diameter. It was the connec
tions on these pipes that blew out. The
connections are riveted through 'flanges,
and while Shea was at work yesterday
morning they suddenly tore loose and the
steam escaping from all the openings Jilled
the boiler room In an' Instant.
The supposition is that Shea was firing
when the mud drum exploded. He was
blown backward against the wall of the
fire room, where he was found by another
ttroman as eoon as the steam had cleared
sufficiently to allow any one to enter. . He
was unconscious and it is believed thai
insensibility mercifully followed his im
pact against the wall of the lire room.
The shock and noise of the explosion
brought a number of people to the scene,
first of whom was the chief engineer, who
carried Shea from the fire room where he
had been injured. There are two fire
rooms, and the chief engineer was in the
one adjoining that In which the explosion
occurred. Shea was, sent at once to the
Receiving Hospital, but soon after 8
o'clock, within an hour of the time he
was Injured, he died. His body was taken
to the Morgue. "
Shea was a married man, 3o years of
age. He had two small children. He lived
at USA Clara street. ,
Carpenter Accidentally Killed.
. Philip Mlel, a carpenter, met with a
shocking death yesterday morning by
falling off the, roof of the house at 1700
California street. He was engaged in ad
justing a pilaster on an ornamental rail
ing on the roof when his foot slipped and
he began to slide down the side of the
roof. In attempting to save himself he
seized the pilaster and carried it with
him in his fall of thirty feet to the con
crete walk below.
The luckless carpenter struck on the
back of his head, the force of the blow
smashing the skull. ,
Miel leaves a wife and family. He was
employed by M. E. Stanford, superniten
dent of the Parrott estate. The house
where the accident occurred is owned by
Albert Pissia, architect. The body was
taken to the Morgue and the Coroner will
Investigate the case. â¢
Mrs Mlel was visiting friends in Oak
land yesterday, and she did not learn of
her husband's death until she returned in
the evening. - ." . -]

United States District Judge Charles B.
Bellinger of Portland, . Or., has denied the
Southern Pacific Company a new trial of
the case of Jiro Harada, who recovered
a judgment in the United States Circuit
Court in this city, Judge Bellinger presid
ing, for S5CKX) damages for the loss of a
leg and several fingers by being run over
by a train in Alameda.
The opinion reached this city yesterday.
Judge Bellinger says:
"I am cf the opinion that negligence on
the part of the plaintiff cannot be predi
cated as a conclusion of law upon the
farts in the case. The construction of the
tracks at this point and the running of
trains over them, as the custom turns out
to have been, made the crossing an extra
hazardous one.. The tender of a locomo
tive in passing that point projects to
within one inch of the cdpe of the side
walk, and the plaintiff was struck and in
jured while in the act of stepping upon
this walk. Under thc-se circumstances a
very lar/r^ degree of car** was required of
those operating the train. At f uch a time
and place there is always probability that
foot passengers will be passing along the
nr**ct at th** crossing. It must have been
known to th*> In charpre of the
*Â»r.plnÂ»Â» that footmen miRht be struck at
th<Â» very edge of the cidewalk by a train
which but p. moment before was upon ihe
BOtttb vrack and had all the appearances
cf a purpose of continuing that way.
The case will be taken to the United
fitatr? Circuit Court of Appeals. Bert

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SACRAMENTO, May 4.â About 150 dele
gates are in attendance on the conference
convention of Republican Clubs at the
State Capitol. The meeting was called to
order by M. J. Curtis, chairman of the
executive committee of the Republican
organization in this district, and the
speakers included Superior Judge E. C.
Hart, Governor Gage. General N. P.
Chipman, Judge J. B. Fulweiler of Au
burn, Hon. Frank B. Coombs and Thomas
V. Cator. The addresses all treated of
Republican campaign issues. It is the
purpose to take the addresses and put
them In pamphlet form for circulation by
the State Central Committee as cam
paign literature.
In the course of his address on Oriental
diplomacy, Hon. Frank L. Coombs thus
treated of the United States' recent ac
quisitions:
The Philippines came to us by accident, by
the fortunes of warâ events unseen and which
no wisdom could forestall. To have attempted
their suhjugatlon through ambition would have
been wrong and impossible. Not to have In
sisted upon them after the grave events which
tried our strength upon the seas in the face of
the world'g predictions of disaster would have
been weakness, and not to have redeemed them
from anarchy would have been criminal and
stained us with blood. They were retained
through necessity, they must be governed by an
unforeseen wisdom Inspired by the circum
stances which may surround Impending neces
sities. Everybody, believes that the islands
should have the greatest liberty compatible
with order. Xobody believes that they should
be left to anarchy. Any statesman who now
attempts to Impose upon them a policy perma
nent In character would be forestalling dire
events beyond his wisdom to see. People make
their own constitutions, yet national character
has first to assert itself along the lines of or
der and Intelligent action.
General Chipman, treating of "Imperi
alism," said in part:
I believe In the sincerity, the honesty of pur
pose of Pres!<5fnt McKlnley. I believe that he
has tieen and sllll is actuated by noble and pa
triotic Impulse under the guidance of sound
judgment.
I do not for a moment doubt, nor do I be
lieve the people of this country doubt, the
absolute truthfulness of his statement "that
from the first day to the last not one word or
line went from the executive In Washington to
our military and naval commanders at Manila,
or to our Peace Commissioners at Paris, that
did not purport as the sole purpose to be kept
in mind first after the success, of our arms and
the maintenance of our honor at home the
welfare and happiness and the rights of the
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands."
And. .Mr. Chairman, It waB at this period
when, if ever, the Feeds of Imperialism were
being fown; it was then that the whole policy
became involved In the rejection or ratification
of the Paris treaty; It was then. If at all. that
lmt>eriall!>m in this country had its sreneels.
Never since the hour of ratification of that
treaty have the rebel Filipinos ceased to make
war upon us and to defy our authority; and
never since that hour ha* there be*n a time
when the military control of the islands could
be withdrawn and civil government erected In
Its stead.
The meeting will be continued to-mor
row, when several others prominent In
the ranks of the Republican party' In this
State are expected to address the confer
ence.

CAPTAIN THOMAS MEIN. the mil
lionaire mine owner and one of the
principal Jijrurcs in the Jameson raid
5n South Africa, died at 3 o'clock
this afternoon at h'.s home at Lake and
Jackson streets. Death was due to con
gestion of the lungs.
Captain MciK was one of the prime mov
ers ;n the Jameson trouble. He was a
leading member of the reform committee
iTtrar.ized by the "Outlanders" at Johan
nesburg, and his office was the headquar
ters, of the commissary department, the
committee having stored vast quantities
of f'Hid there to Le used in case of a siege.
At one time, in order to protect his iiie,
he ran from the fetation at Pretoria to the
Pretoria Prison, and to his presence of
mind in thf face of a mob he probably
owed his life. \Vith John Hays Ham
mond and Francis Rhodes he was sen

Resolution Concerning the Rule Gov
erning Amusements Referred
to a Committee.
CHICAGO, May 4. â At to-day's session
of the Methodist Conference the houra
were lightened by some vivacious as well
as vigorous debate. Dr. Henry Brown,
Columbia River Conference, brought the
amusement question to the front early in
the day by offering a resolution which In
substance was that the conference by
proper action enow the world that the
church had not changed front on the
amusement question. He asked, to fore
stall action by those In favor of greater
liberality In this matter, that rule 248 of
the Book of Discipline be for the next
quadrennlum left absolutely unchanged.
A sharp debate on parliamentary techni
calities followed, resulting in the resolu
tion being referred to the committee on
the state of the church.
Rev. J. A. Kumler of Illinois stirred up
further debate by calling for a commit
tee of 141, one from each conference dis
trict, to inquire into the matter of the
deaconesses' societies. Rev. G. N. Jack
son of the Rock River Conference secured
the floor and asked that the committee bb
doubled in size by the appointment of one
lay and one clerical delegate from each
conference. After further debate the com
mittee was reduced to fifty, to be com
posed of an equal number of laymen and
preachers.
Dr. William G. Wilson of Iowa intro
duced a resolution which caused the most
active and vigorous debate of the session.
The resolution, after being amended, is as
follows:
Resolved, That no Bishop or general confer
ence officer shall receive anything above actual
expenses for services in the dedication and re
opening of churches, attending commencements
of Methodist educational Institutions or for
any similar services which he might render the
church
The Insinuation in the resolution that
the Bishops had asked for more than ac
tual expenses in instances was received
with indignant looks by the Bishops them
selves. William J. Welch, a layman of
the Wyoming Conference, supported the
resolution as amended and declared that
the standing of the church was impaired
by the practice of the Bishops In demand-
Ing fees for officiating at dedicatory and
kindred exercises.
It was resolved to request all the Protes
tpnt pastors In the United States to read
to their congregations the Bishops' ad
dreps. delivered to the conference yester
day, containing 15.000 words.
Pacific Unitarians Complete
Work of the Annual
Session.
BERKELEY, May 4.â The Pacific Uni
tarian Conference, which has been in ses
sion for the last four days In the Unita
rian church, was brought to a close to
day. At the morning session Mrs. Emily
A. FIfleld of Boston, secretary of the Na
tional Alliance, spoke on "The National
Alliance and Its Work." She said;
"Organized work among women is of re
cent development and now it has come to
be the watchword of the women. Women
through organization have learned of the
people; they have learned of mutual help
fulness and sympathy. The alliance is the
organization in which the women are
brought together to accelerate the growth
and progress of character. It is the work
of the alliance to vitalize the religion of
the churches. It emphasizes the mission

that such waa the fact and he said the
suit was the last resort of a liberal
woman to recover that 'which 'was justly
due. ; . , Â¦ -i .
Some time ago, when the case was' first
called, counsel for the estate demanded a
bill of particulars. The court made aji or
der that such a bill be filed, and yesterday
It waa taken up for consideration. There
was set out on the bill pages of detailed
charges, each one carrying with it a
story of good times and revelry. The
Judge remarked that there were some
charges that required most delicate
consideration â¢ on the* part of, thÂ«
court, while the absence^of specific date9
on which the revelries that occasioned
the charges occurred led the court to the
conclusion that counsel had not compiled
with the order of the court for a bill of
particulars, and hence plaintiff was' pre
cluded from backing tip her bill with a
host of witnesses.
Although Judge Dalngerfleld's ruling
makes the plaintiff's fight to recover on
her claim practically a hopeless one. her
counsel stated that he would proceed to
the end and the story of the good times
Jesse Sheldon Potter enjoyed but did not
pay for may yet be told In court.
Lavina V. Wettleson, by a ruling made
by Judge Dalngerfield yesterday, will be
precluded from tellin* a detailed story
on the witness stand of all the good times
she alleges Jesse Sheldon Potter once en
joyed at her home, 225 Ellis street. Lavina
Wettleson alleges that the estate of the
late Jesso Sheldon Potter Owes her $1210 In
payment for the good times he enjoyed in
the house on his unlimited credit. C. C
Boynton, attorney for Mrs. Potter, exec
utrix of the estate, said yesterday In court
that the suit was instituted for purposes
of blackmail. Attorney J. H. Long, rep
resenting the plaintiff. Indignantly denied
Lavina V. Wettleson Says
He Enjoyed Life to Her
i Great Loss.

SALT LAKE, Utah. May 4.â The great
est funeral train in the history of Western
America started on Its sad Journey from
Scofleld to-day. The train had upon It
the remains of sixty-two of the vic
tims of the Winter Quarters disas
ter. Accompanying the bodies were many
relatives, who are bowed down with the
severity of the blow that tHey have so
suddenly sustained.
About 1 o'clock this- afternoon the body
of. young Langstaff was brought out of
No. 1. Tt was found with four others in
a part of the mine known as Pikes Peak.
One of the miners who was in the mine
at the time of the explosion, and who was
one of the first of the rescuers who went
in to recover the bodies, tells an interest
ing story. He was in No. 1. In the first
raise, when the explosion occurred, but so
far away from it that the sound did not
reach him. He noticed a movement in the
air, but thought it was the result of a cave
and worked on a quarter of an hour, when
his miner's instinct told him that some
thing was wrong, and he came on down
to the main entry.
A door had been fitted in here to keep
the current of good air from going above
and to direct it into the main workings,
where It would meet the damp and either
weaken it very much or drive It back.
This door was guarded on the other side. '
Passing on to the mouth of the tunnel,
this miner, with others. Joined Superin
tendent T. J. Parmeley and went to No. 4,
where the greatest danger existed. Out
side of the mine those working had all
been Injured, so the party was small.
The total amount of the relief fund so
far is $36,805. â¢
Governor Heber M. Wells has issued a
proclamation to the people of the State
of Utah, urging prompt and energetic ac
tion for the relief of the grlef-strlcken
families of the dead miners of Scofleld
and appointing a central subscription
committee.

POSTUM CEREAL.
A CASE OF "TREMENS"
Can Be Brought on by Coffee.
"It is a well-known fact that one can
bring on delirium tremens just as surely
by the excessive usp of coffee as of
whisky, and the cofTee habit is just -is
much a condition of slavery as the whis-
ky habit. To be sure, if one has consti-
tution enough to stand the effects of
either coffee or whisky and prefers to
continue their use. that might be a'ques-
tion for them to decide." So says Mrs.
Amy K. Glass of Rolfe, la., who contin-
ues: "My mother never drank coffee
until in middle life. It produced an ob-
stinate case of dysentery, which could
not be checked with medicines until she
gave up coffee. She is now sixty-five
years old and welcomes the Postum
Cereal Food Coffee for a warm drink it
breakfast. It has made her well and
ruddy where before she was ill and lack-
ing the appearance of good red blood,
which she now shows.
"I repard Postum as the greatest
blessing to mankind. It is a curious
condition to hear temperance lecturers
talk to people about the liquor habit
when frequently they themselves are
slaves to the coffee habit."
Posturn Cereal Food Coffee, when
thoroughly boiled, yields a perfect
breakfast beverage, beautiful in its rich
golden brown color, with a ripe, crisp,
toothsomfe flavor, while the ingredients
are such that nervous systems are built
up by the action of small molecules of
Phosphate of Potash obtained from
cereals, without which the system can-
not make brain matter and the gray
substance that fills the nerve centers afl
over the body. The discontinuance of
coffee and the change to Postum Food
CofTec therefore works at both ends, for
the good of the user.
A small piece of butter the size of two
peas, placed in the pot, will prevent
Postum from boiling over.-

Mystery Surrounding the Death of
Wilson and Field Is
Unsolved.
The Field and Wilson cases are still
"shrouded In a dark veil of mystery," and
the police department has nothing new to'
offer the public in regard to the solution
of either. . .
"Frankie" Norton, the woman who was
In the room of the Kearny-street lodging
house with Frank Field just before his
death occurred, was arrested again early
yesterday morning and placed in the tanks
at the City Prison pending the result of
the Coroner's, inquest, which was post
poned until Tuesday morning. She made
an additional statement- to Captain Sey
mour, but it is of no material value. The
police, satisfied to follow the suggestion
of suicide as given out at the Morgue,
are resting on this theory, although De
tective Ross Whitaker has been detailed
on the case. It is of no conse/juence to
the detectives that the man was shot high
in the head or that he sustained a fiac
ture of the skull from some outside force,
and at the time of his death was found
resting, in a natural position on the bed.
â¢In the Wilson case there are no new
developments. Detectives Cody and Bur

OF INTEREST TO
THE GOLD SEEKERS
LODGE WHICH THE MAYOR WOULD TAKE FROM THE
COMMISSION.
flt? ATOR PHELAN has buzzing in his busy brain another fantastic freak
//y/Vi notion that his unwarranted interference in municipal affairs is for the
public good. His Honor has entertained many of these notions, but
the latest rivals all of the others in official nonsense. He intends, if
he can, to take the Golden Gate Park Lodge out of the control of the Park
Commissioners, place it under the direction of the Trustees of the Free Pub
lic Library, make of it a . louneing-room and branch library and establish the
headquarters of the Park Â¦ Commission In the City Hall, where It will be of
the least possible service.
His Honor wants to have the Commissioners of Golden Gate Park directly
under his benign influence. He wants them to be near him. wnere he can see
them, supervise them, counsel and direct them, and watch that they perform
their duties conscientiously and for the public good. His Honor feels the very
great weight of his authority and responsibility.
What strange fantasy b,as inspired the Mayor to this purpose no one can
tell, for the ways of his Honor are inscrutable, but on Thursday, at a meeting
of the Trustees of the Free Public Library, he announced his scheme and de
clared that a majority of the Park Commissioners will indorse him in it. He
declared that it is better for the great municipal family, over which he ar
rogates the position of head, to be housed under one roof, where his beneficent
and exalted influence can be more keenly felt.
The Mayor has a very high opinion of the character of that Influence, but it
seems to be an unnecessary taxing of his strength to do everything in that pecu
liar and mysterious way which he affects. His Honor should not forget that
he is not always in the City Hall, and if he seeks to keep a watchful eye over the
Commissioners of Golden Gate Park, why not house them in a neighborhood
where his genial Influence is frequently felt and where he finds opportunity and
occasion to pass much of his time? Why not, for example, establish the Park
Commissioners in a lodge in the neighborhood of Pierce and Turk streets?
The locality would be ve;y accessible to him and probably will be as satisfac
tory to the Park Commissioners as the City Hall. While his Honor is inspired
with an idea that he has a divine. mission of Interference in affairs with which
he has no possible concern he might move the park lodge Itself down on to Mar
ket'street. But his Honor possibly has not discussed this phase of the matter
yet and will not do so until he has elaborated and perfected his idea of making
a loafing room for loungers out of the lodge.
, He has. it is said, some very definite ideas about what shall constitute this
lfbrary. His recent uip into literature establishes him in the public eye as a
literary star and it is said that he has fixed opinions on what his people shall and
shall not read: Friends of his Honor shake their heads very wisely and say
that he never will permit The Call of January 16, 1900, or any possible reference
literary or otherwise to Blggys or laundries to enter the library on the ground
that it is seditious literature. "How to Make Ante-Election Pledges and Break
Them.": "How I Didn't Klect a Chief of Police"; "The Correct Mod
ern Method of Forcing Merchants to Sprinkle Their Streets": "The Unwisdom
of Protecting Citizens From the Crimes of Night Marauders"; "The Strange
Story of a Silk Hat and What Was Under It"; "Hefting Made Easy, or a New
Way to Watch the Treasury"; "How to Receive Credits in School While Travel
ing in the Orient" ; "Instructions Designed to Teach Unmounted Police How to
Catch Runaways in the Park"; "A Practical Theory Qf How Belated Citizens in
San Francisco Can Get Home Without a Lantern"; "The True Story of How
Sullivan Alley Became Private Property"; "Why I Became an Enemy of Scotch
Politics," are works that unquestionably will pass the censorship of his Honor
and find place in the new library. Perhaps his Honor will present the city with
a portrait of himself In oils or emblazon the windows of the lodge with scenes in
his interesting career done in art glass.
But these are matters simply of probability. The Mayor's capacity for do
ing the unexpected is infinite. He may decide to* close the park and make it a
parade ground for the police. He has, however, consented io grant one smalt
concession in the affair. He says he will permit Superintendent McLaren to re
main in the lodge, so there need be no apprehension of a change unless perhaps
some member of the Fay family should decide to move in.
The case of Charles E. Broad, charged
with assault with a deadly weapon, was
dismissed by Judge Fritz yesterday. Broad
during the fight for the possession of the
Tax Collector's office, January 12. was ar
rested for throwing an Inkstand at At

ing the inkstand, but said it was fired at

; "The trouble is," said the young officer,
"that the boys are not permitted to go
after the enemy and ilntsh them, as is
generally understood to be the thing in
warfare. They have to do a aort of po
lice duty, and that means lying in rain
soaked camps and only occasionally hav
ing a brush with the enemy. Death' from
disease always stares tnem in the face.
When a man gets sick he is sent to the
hospital and gets excellent treatment, but
when he becomes convalescent and needs
to be built up he has no chance. A run
up to Kobe or Yokohama would give him
fresh air and the change brace him up,
but he cannot get it. The hospital ship
that ought to be there for that work lies
here in the harbor and has been here for
mortths. The men either want to fight
or come home."
j Ensign Fred Perkins of the navy, a son
of Senator Perkins, who won distinction

officer who has just returned from the
Philippines that there are between 500 and

who have tendered their resignations to
General Otis. Only a few of the resigna
tions have ever reached Washington,
ilost of the officers are young men who
were appointed from civil life at the out

for the trade of war. The principal rea
son they gave for wanting to return home
is that It means sure death from disease

PHELAN'S FREAK OF
OFFICIAL NONSENSE
JOHN F. CARRERE, secretary of
the State Lunacy Commission, has
handed In his resignation and Gov
ernor Gage has secured the appoint
ment of his political, t personal and
Democratic friend, E. O. Stevens, to
lill the vacancy. Back of this there
was a row among the members of
the commission and the Governor, but the
latter was successful and Mr. Carrere
stepped down and out rather than to al
low his friends on the board to become
further estranged with the chief- execu
tive of the. State. Away down at the bot
tom of the whole affair was a promise
made by Gage during his candidacy for
Governor to reward Stevens, who was the
editor of a Los Angeles Democratic paper,
for not opposing Gage too strongly. Ste
vens was to have been appointed secre
tary of the California Paris Commission.
Political pressure from Alameda was too
strong and the resuit was that Yarney C.
Gaskill got the job.
Gage all this time was looking for an
opening into which to shove his Southern
California friend and as a last resort he
undertook to oust Carrere In the interest
of Stevens. In this he met with no little
opposition. On the board are, besides the
The proposition to turn down Carrere
was broached at a recent meeting of the
commission. Not being able to force the
fight on square lines in an open field Gage
waited until the recent Republican con
vention at Los Angeles, which nearly all
of the other Commissioners attended.
While they were there the Governor, slip
ping out of IjOS Angeles, went to Sacra
mento and without excuse or reason de
manded of Secretary Carrere his resigna
tion. Carrere saw what the move meant
and realized that if he made a fight to
retain his position he would draw his
friends into an ugly mess. So he resigned.
Three days ago the commission held a
meeting at Sacramento and Carrere's res
ignation was read and accepted. Before
the Commissioners had time to catch their
breath Gage announced his Democratic
Los Angelea friend for the place. There
was nothing for the members of the board
to do but "fall In" and appoint Stevens.

Ford. Secretary of State Charles F. Cur

When the matter of throwing Carrere out
was broached there was a loud protest,
but this was silenced in the cases of those
on the commission who were the Gover
nor's appointees.

the proposition for a rrimary election.
A. Ruef Inquired if the gentleman who
guaranteed the Republican State Central
Committee that primaries would be held in

"He was present," replied the chairman,
"and fald that the newspaper? did not
rorrectly report his remarks addressed to

It is quite well known that J. Alva "tt'att

Save after the State Central Committee
adjourned Watt changed front and voted

Mr. Ruef said there was almost univer

Fifth growing out of the methods adopt

publfcans were opposed to the principle of
â¢xcludi:ig the people from opportunity to
â¢xpress a choice in Ihe selection of dele

rressional District might be placed on

for Hearing by Commissioner
Hea cock.
Only Three of Them Have Been Set
CHINESE HABEAS COEPUS CASES
THE expose of the Chinese slave traf
fic at this port by The Call has cre
ated widespread consternation
among those who have been in the
rinp or arc involved in any way In the
outrageous trade. Oflleials of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, the Oriental
and Occidental Steamship Company and
the Toyo Kaisen Kaisha have held numer
ous conferences to determine what they
shall do to escape from the consequences
of their violation of Federal laws.
Federal officials are disturbed and un
easy and fearful of what new exposures
may be made In the traffic which has dis
graced this city. The Chinese "native
sons" that have been Illegally held upon
the dock of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, some of them having been de
tained for months, are now in the County
Jail under the jurisdiction of the United
States Marshal and awaiting what dispo
sition shall be made of them by the United
States courts.
In Chinatown dismay ruled, and the
opinion is universal that The Call's expose
has destroyed the traffic. Upon the many
incidents of the day came the information
late last nisht from Washington that the
United States Treasury Department has
ordered by telegraph an immediate inves
tigation of the charges that the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company is illegally land
ing and detaining Chinese on its dock.
The Washington officials are determined
that these violations shall be stopped at
once and that the most thorough inquiry
shall be made.
The law governing the matter is abso
lutely explicit. It provides that the mas
ter of any vessel who permits a Chinese
illegally to leave the vessel upon which he
arrivs at this port shall be subject to a
line of $500 or an imprisonment of one year
for every Chinese so illegally landed.
The law also provides that any respon
sible agent of any steamship company
who aids or abets in the illegal landing
of any Chinese shall be subjected to a
fine of $1000 for every case. Every master |
of every vessel bringing Chinese to this
port swears in his manifest that his pas
sengers are Chinese. The master is pre
sumed to know of what he is speaking:,
and In his manifest he swears to his
knowledge.
It is impossible, therefore, for the re
sponsible parties In this traffic tÂ« avoid
the consequences of what has been done
on the Pacific Mail dock. Hundreds of
Chinese have been placed in the detention
shed on the dock and have been kept there
by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
for months. Agents of the company are
striving to create the impression that
these Chinese are not detained by the
company, but by the Collector of the Port.
This is simply another cheap subterfuge
of the agents of the guilty companies to
evade responsibility. They seem to forget
the very important fact that when law
yers secure writs of habeas corpus for
coolie citizens the writs are made return
able, not upon the Collector of the Port,
but upon the master of the vessel or the
agent of the offending company.
So autocratic and arrogant have become
these agents that when Collector of the
Port John P. Jackson hurriedly ordered
the deportation of the mob of coolies on
Thursday the agent of the company re
fused to obey the Collector's command. It
was necessary' to threaten force before
the coolies were hustled on board the ves
sel and sent out of the harbor back to
China. It is In this condition that the af
fair now rests. The Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company is stung at the loss of its
great and illegal profit in its Chinese
boarding house on the dock. The agents
of the company, if their contention wens
true, have as much right to maintain a
detention shed for Chinese in Union
square as' they have on the Pacific Mall
dock.
The steamer Coptic, with her horde of
Mongolians aboard, is still held In quar
antine by Dr. Klnyoun. The cabin pas-
Fcngers were landed yesterday, but it will
be several days before the Chinese and
Japanese are brought over from Angel
Island. There were 45S Chinese and 157
Japanese in the steerage of the vessel.
The 105 cabin passengers had a lively time
of it keeping out of their way.
Among the Mongols there are three
women, eleven boys and one infant. Of
the Chinese 27 are in transit to Vancou
ver, B. C and 1S9 are for San Francisco.
The remainder are in transit for Panama,
Mexico. Cuba and other foreign countries.
Of the 189 who come to San Francisco
two are teachers, one is a student, three
are women of no occupation, seven native
born men and twelve or fifteen are boys
coming with an uncle, a brother or a
cousin. Of the 1S6 males 171 are grocers,
two teachers, one student and- twelve
minor children, relatives of grocers.
