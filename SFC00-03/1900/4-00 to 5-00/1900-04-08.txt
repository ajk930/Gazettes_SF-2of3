Ernest Seton-Thompson, author of
"Wild Animals ] Have Kn,own." "The
Biography of a Grizzly," etc.. In writing
In the .March Century of "The National
Zoo at "Washington." raises an Interesting
question as to the relative value of domes
tic anlmala and human Invention*.
At the b'-pinr.ing of this century the
continent ot North America was one vast
and teeming same range. Not only were
the bnflalo in millions across the Missis
sippi but other large game was fully as
ebundant, though less conr.piouous. Herds
of rlk, numb* ring ten or fifteen thousand,
were commonly seen along the Dpper Mlk
pvuri. The antelope ranged the higher
Ti'.ainH in herds of thousands; whitetail
ilver. though less gregarious, were B^en In
hands of hundreds, while bighorn cheep,
though still less disposed to gather In
large flocks, were rarely out of sight In
the lower parts of the Eastern Rockies,
and It was quite usual to see several hun
dred blacktail In the course of a single
day's travel.
Hut a change set in when the pioneer
Americans, with their horse*, their deadly
rifies. their energy and their taste for
murder, began to Invade the newly found
West. The settlers increased In numbers
and the rifle* became more deadly each
year: but the animals did not improve In
speed, cunning or fecundity in an equal
ratio, and yo'were defeated* In the struggle
for life and started on the down grade to
ward extinction. Aside from sentimental
or esthetic reasons, which I shall not here
discuss, the extinction of a large or highly
organized animal In a serious matter.
1. It is always dangerous to disturb the
balance of nature by removing a poise.
Some of the worst plagues have arisen in
this way.
2. Wo do not know without much and
careful experiment how vast a service
that animal might have done to mankind
us a domestic species. ,
The fore* of this will be more apparent
if we recollect how much the few well
known domestic species have done for the
advancement of our race. Who can de
cide which has done more for mankind,
the cow or the uteam engine,, the horse or
electricity, the sheep or the printing uresa,
the dog or the rifle, the ass or the loom?
No one Indeed can pronounce on these,
yet all on reflection feel that there is rea
son in the comparisons. Take away these
inventions and we are put back a century
or perhaps two; but further, take away
the domestic animals and we are reduced
to absolute savagery, for It was they who
first made it possible for our aboriginal
forefathers to nettie in one place and learn
the rudiments of civilization.
of th<Â« world. There nevÂ»=r before was an
instance exactly parallelâ where one na

Its rulers and liberate Its people without
expectation of reward or purpose to even

never ancther instance where a nation,
having done this, was most royally con

that is the situation lierr. The Cubans

The pifjudiitâ t-j designate it by no
harsher termâ againtit Americana has no
rSearly detlned enure. It is probably due
to American lack of experience In such
iarpe contact with a foreign peopleâ to
thÂ«ir lack of tact in favorably Impressing
them in small thitiÃPâ and to not having a
clean-cut policy from the very outset. The
matter lias been permitted to drag along,
all tlie time there being a most annoying
friction between the two peoples. Tho

politic in hi-* personal relations. The
American is rather, brusque and self-opin

soUJicr fevl.s for the Cuban soldier and his

be almost enough In Itself to create en

that the future Is assured. The English
Capitalist feels justified In taking greater

ThlÂ« is to be a prosperous year for Cuba;
Stimulated by the high prices of the past
year tobacco raisers planted an enormous
crop. It is estimated that 490,000 bales,*
or 40,000,000 - pounds.* will be gathered,
which will be twice the crop of last year.
Another reason- for the largo acreage is
the . Impoverishment of so many sugar
planters through' revolution, their, cane
fields being devastated by the Cuban and
Spanish forces alike, and their plants be
ing in many . cases destroyed. They are '
recuperating through tobacco, which la
a quick crop, while It takes three or four
years to get cane into profitable bearing.
Then it docs not require an expensive
plant , to ; handle tobacco, while the mills

capital. Tobacco merchants say that this
year's crop will, be of fine quality, though
some express fears that owing" to its vol

Another crop that has been very largely
planted Is the pineapple. A plantation In
the immediate vicinity of Havana is one
of the sights which tourists visit. The
soil Is of brick red and the plants, with
fruit two- thirds grown, fairly cover the
3urface. Yet the soil is of such prodigious
richness that a crop of bananas Is raised
between the pineapple rows. Adjacent and
all along the road are small fields of
tobacco, which are now being cut, though
the curing process will take some three
months yet. The new crop will not come

The fertility of the soil is almost past
belief. Much of the acreage now under
cultivation has been farmed for two or
three hundred years. For the most part it
is rudely cultivated and does not appear
to be ever enriched by artificial fertilizers,
yet it produces enormously and shows no
sign of Impoverishment. But a small
fraction of the cultivable land is im
proved. The crudest implements are used.
We saw plow teams of oxen at work, the
plow, being but a shade better than the
forked stick of medieval times. It does
not turn a furrowâ simply disturbs the
soil, loosening it sio that the seed may be
planted. Anything put in the ground
grows luxuriously at any time. Fruits
such as oranges, lemons. Ilme3 and guavas
grow wild. The oranges are small and
lull of seeds, but are very sweet, vying
with those of California in flavor.
With American enterprise, machinery
and capital Cuba would soon be made the
richest division of land in the world.
But these hold aloof. If the Government
of the island has in the past barred for
eigners from Introducing modern meth
ods, that 1 , of the present Is so uncertain
as to still keep them out. The antipathy
of the Cubans and rurales to the Ameri

many who come here to engage in busi

cities they encounter all sorts of obstacles
in the way of getting licenses and conces

nucleus of the West, however, for the
newsboy, is Seattle. There the "Home for
Newsboys" offers shelter in time of sick
ness and rest in time of weariness, and
thitherward the newsboy moves in times
of trouble. Some of them are perma
nent residents of San Francisco, among
them "Milkcan Tommy," whose name was
acquired through an early habit. His
morning duty took him the rounds of the
houses on Telegraph Hill, and Tommy
was addicted to the habit of drinking the
milk from the cans left oft the doorstep*
as he went his route.
"Fagan" is the name of a boy who has
no other name that he knows of. His
phenomenal luck at craps and his success
in newsboy pools suggested the name,
which was given him by an onlooker, and
It has clung to him ever since. "Happy
Dougherty" and little "Toots" mean noth
ing in particular, except that the owners
of the names are. one good natured and
thp other diminutive.
"McGinty," our guest, also answers to
the name of Monte, or Mountie. The
origin of the latter name is 6hrouded in,
doubt. It is insisted by some of his
friends that the name "Monte" was given
him from his association with the far
famed game of "three-card monte." and
It Is held by others that a peculiar large
ness of the head occasioned the first name
of "Mountain Head."* which afterward
shortened to "Mountain" and then
"Mountie."
"Pants." when In the early stages of
newsboy life, one day wore his father's
coat and vest on the street. Th<Â» 6mall
figure with the big clothes was the sub
ject of much comment, and some ona
asked "Where is the pants?" They hava
called him "Pants" ever since. % -
This last named youth had become our
guest merely by accident. The original
Invitation had been hastily written on
nothin*," was McGlnty'a advice In a very
audible undertone.
So poor Pants toyed with the duck until
it. was superseded by the sweet morsels,
more to his taste, when the waiter light
ed the cognac for the rum omelet there
was one single remark and that from Mc-
Ginty, with marked anxiety:
"Say. de fire's de finish, ain't It?"
Throughout the dinner the two little
street urchins had fallen" naturally and
easily into the ways of their surround
ings. With keen eyes on the alert, they
haa patterned their behavior from obser
vation, and it was surprising to what
purpose they observed. Aside from get
ting tangled up in the proper use of their
knives and forks and an occasional use of
a coatsleeve instead of a napkin, the two
unique little guests covered themselves
with glory.
As we left the restaurant we were sur
rounded by a score of newsboys, who had
heard of "Pants' " and "MeGinty's" good
fortune. They had been standing outside
with noses flattened against the glass
doors, watching throughout the dinner.
But "Pants" and "McGinty" had arisen
suddenly In the social scale, and they gave
their comrades the most finished kind of
an "overlook."
And the dinner was not all. It was fol
lowed by the opera. Â»
We were driven to the Grand Opera
half falling from his chair. Th<Â» French
dinner had been too much fr>r him. ar.rj
even the music and the glitter of "Alad
din Jr." could not k*ep him awake. A
gentle shake startled him and evoked tha
yawning remark:
"Gees." but me lamp 3 won't stay open."
At the door of the theater we bade M:r
quomlam guests farewell, and tney dis
appeared into the night, leaving us won
dering if the gray hours of the c">M. lone
ly dawn, when they must bo on the Â«treet
plying their trade, would bo any brighter
for the memory of "Aladdin Jr." and the
Poodle Dog. MADAM JONATHAN.
A NEW STOCK COMPANY IS COMING TO TOWN
In the carriage they were introduced to
the "loidy."
"This Is 'Pants,' and this is Monte, or
â¢McGinty,' " said the "gent." The boys
made a bashful attempt to lift their
headgear, but compromised by merely
shifting their hats around a little more.
I asked "McGinty" if he had just come
ap from the bottom of the sea.
"Kaw, I jes' come from de cooler." he
replied without a smile.
Tell the lady why you could not come
it 6 o'clock, as you promised," said the
"gent."
"Oh. de cop pinched us fur fightin',' he
laid, as nonchalantly as if being "pinch
ed" was not a thing to be surprised at.
"Were you pinched, too. Pants?"
"Yes'm." he replied, with a far away
look in his brown eyes. "A soak wuz
tryin" to get his flippers onto de papers,
an' we couldn' stan' fur it, so I jes' let
him have one in de mug."
"Yes'm, Pants is pretty handy wfd de
mitts, too," Interrupted McGinty. with an
admiring glance at his pugilistic friend.
Arriving at the Poodle Dog my escort
alighted and the two boys fell out., after
their own peculiar manner, followed by
myself. As we entered the brilliantly

posedly and unconcernedly as if a meal
of seven or eight courses was quite an in
significant episode in his life.
Opposite him "McGinty" was doing am-
Elc justice to everything In sight. With
im conversation was at a premium â he
was otherwise engaged. Soup, salad, fish
âall were stowed away with alacrity un
der the ragged vest, but when the frogs'
legs were served an expression of amaze
ment overspread the goad-humored face
and a marked hesitancy exhibited Itself.
Catching the eye of "Pants" he queried
in a stage whisper: I
"Say. 'Pants,' kin you stan* fur de
jumps?"
"If de loidy eats 'em I can." answered
Pants valiantly, and steadily nibbled.
When the waiter asked which he pre
ferred, roast turkey or duck, the surfeited
expression that overspread MeGinty's
countenance was irresistibly comical. He
had not realized that things were going
to keep on coming in that manner and
even his capacity was beginning to be
stretched. But he took a sip of the
"Widow Cliquot's" wine from the glass
sparkling at his side and braced up. His
order for turkey was given in a manner
that would justify the supposition that he

* A REPORTER FOR THE CALUHERALD. <?
To those zt'ho are interested in the problems of modern society
and of home, one of the most interesting questions of the day is that
cf the changing relations of wives and husbands in domestic life.
The question of the lights and duties of wires and husbands
is rather a broad one, but pcrliaps ?;r can use this as a starting
point: A bright woman said to me the other day that originally the
husband had all the rights and the wife all the duties, and that the
modern movement was simply leveling iliis discrepancy.
Professor GMdir.grâ l do not admit that
tn early time* men had all the rights and
â¢women all the duties. How can we say
this If we acknowledge that the bread
winner In the main has been the man dur-
Jr.g many ger.t rations past â in fact, al
ways, except in the very earliest times?
As I understand the matter, one of the
wishes â perhaps we ought not tfc say de
man>-. s â of women in recent years has been
to enter freely into competition with men.
F:>, 1 dnubt If we can cay that the duties
ell Lclor.g. or have ever belonged, to the
women. The duties once were different
from what they are to-day. That seems
to 1Â«Â» the fact of the matter. They are
distributed differently to-day.
Mrs. Orolyâ Forty yearn ago women had
absolutely nD rights in property: no right
to th*Â» possession of anything that they
earned or anything that they Inherited.
Their possession of anything in the world
was a mere act of suffrance and of will-
Ingness on tho part of man. Now, if men
In tho^e days had not been generally bot
trr than tho iaws, the condition of women
wou!(! have been intolerable. The men
themselves felt the injustice of it, and in
a rnmrure revolted from It. Men who had
daughters and who possessed property
Â¦which they wished to leave to these
daughters were perplexed how to do it
i,n order to prevent whatever they might
leave from being the prey of unscrupulous
men.
Judpe Truax â I think we must locate the
rtate of affairs depicted by Mrs. Croly
further back tiian forty years. The move
ment toward enlarging the property
rights of women, to which refers, be
gan about 1?45 â almost sixty years ago.
Whether it was forty or sixty years ago
of course does not make any material
difTorrnce so far as the argument is con
oerned.
Mrs. Crolyâ l could give some very cu
rious instances, but an Individual case is
r.evcr a fair example of generally existing
conditions. But there is no one livingâ
r.o man or womanâ whose recollection ex
tends back forty years who does not re
member a state of things that was dls-
Braceful to humanity. All this has been
changed by the sense of Justice tfn the
part of men themsel\*es.
Professor Giddingsâ Do not men usually
live on a higher moral plane than the law
requires?
Mrs. Crolyâ Yes. the best class of men
<Jo. There is always a class of men bet
ter than tho law. I think there is hardly
c n'^stion of that.
Judge Truaxâ As a matter of fact, so far
s~ property rights are concerned, such
distinction as the* law make 3 between
men and women at the present time is in
favor of tho women. For Instance, sup-
X>osÂ«? that I. a married man, own a hous 1 ;.
Jn case 1 sell that house I cannot give a
foo<l title to it toy my signature alon<Â».
I must have my wife's consent to sell It.
That is designed to protect her dower
rights. On the contrary, if she owns the
house the' can" Bell it without consulting
rae. I havo nothing whatever to say
nbcut It. 1 have no rights In her property,
but she has rights In mine.
Ycu cl agree that there has been â¢ change
viihln the past forty or fifty years. Has this
bren a movement toward equalizing the
j-osltion of men Â«nd women?
Mrs. Crolyâ l think that every clrcum
ptar.ee lends to show that we are ap
r>ro:i(-hi!ijj iin tqufi'.ization of human
lights ar.d human duties r.s between men
and Vi<;tnÂ«-n.
Ju:igc Truaxâ The charges in the law
have boÂ«.n chiefly for the benefit and pro
tection of woman. The law as It relates
to U.e position of thÂ« man has been left
In general as it was.
Mrs. Hensleyâ The cquali^Won of rights
vecms to me to be inevitable. An equali
zation of v.ork or of position is another
matter.
Mr?. Crolyâ l <5o not say an equalization
cf wotk and position, but an equalization
cf c.ut!Â«-s. I believe In that.
Professor Giddings â An equalization of
abstract rights Is possible. I think we
ere approaching that; but when you say.
rifhts and duties I think you wrongly
cou;i> the terms. I doubt the possibility
cf ever eqi:a!;zi:!g duties In this world 33
betv.-tcji rren anil women, or between one
clr.?s a::<l another, or between adu'.ts and
children; or as between any two groups
or classes of men.'
Judce Truaxâ At the present time men
and women stand substantially on an
Â«><V.]3 % .ity no far as the law is concerned.
Jf th<>re Is an Inequality on one rlrte in
favor of the man. there is an inequality
in favor of the woman to balance it. For
instance, a woman cannot vote. In that
respect she Is not equal to a man In the
eyes of the law. On the other hand; a
married woman can dispose of her prop
erty Independently. In that "respect a
married man Is not her equal before the
law.
We!!, let us call it thwi, the "liberal
movement" as affecting the position of wo
men.
Professor Giddingsâ You mean a move
ment toward increasing and multiplying
her opportunities? Yes, I should say that
there undoubtedly has been a movement
of that kind.
Mrs. Hensleyâ You must remember that
as far as the industries are concerned the
greater part of the work that women aro
taking up now is work that they dia or
iginally in their homes. That work has
been taken away from' the home, and it is
but right that women should have the op
portunity of working in these occupations
if they see tit.
Mrs. Orolyâ That Is an economic change.
Professor Glddingsâ lt is true, is it not,
that the change which has taken place In
the law, as it affects women in industrial
occupations, has brought about a change
in the home lifeâ ln the relations of hus
band and wife, for example? If the wife
becomes a breaJearner outside of the
home, instead of In the home, as former
ly, the relations of husband and wile In
the home are materially changed. If the
wife must work in the factory or behind
the counter all day long, she cannot pos
sibly take the same care of the home
that she formerly v.d. In a modified de
gree, the same statement would apply to
the professional woman.
You 6ay that the wife who works at a
trade or, a profession cannot take as good
care of the home now as she did formerly.
I'o you take Into consideration the fact that
the has not one-half the duties to perform In
her home that ehe had formerly?
Professor Giddings- -Suppose she has not
one-half as many duties to perform.
Suppose that she goes out at 7 or 8 o'clock
in' the morning and comes home at 5 or C
in the evening, utterly tired out and used
vp, as a woman usually is after eight or
nine hours of workâ how much can she
do in the home? The work of the woman
in the home a generation ago was not as
exacting in many respects as It Is to-day.
although it' was more multifarious. The
standard of living was not as high. Men
and children were not as much waited on
as they are to-day even by their wives.
in spite of the fact that the wives have
more opportunity to-day. They were less
waited upon in my boyhood than they are
to-day.
Mrs. Crolyâ l- do not agree with that.
Professor GlddJngs. at all. I know" that
fifty years ago the ordinary man not only
expected to be waited upon, but was
waited upon in a way that no man would
dream of being waited upon now. A
great many men, especially among the
poorer classes, were in the habit of sit
ting down to the table alone and eating
all i hat' they wanted of whatever was fur
nished upon the table. The wife and the
children had only what the man left. I
am speaking now of the laboring class.
No man furnished his wife with an allow
ance to keep house. She was furnished
with sixpence or a shilling cr sixteen
penro or two and sixpence or whatever It
was that the food for one day required,
and she had to give an accounting of
everything that was spent to the last
penny.
The -change that has taken place shows
that the home life has improved, so far as
the position of the wlfe-iu concerned?
Mrs. Croly-Yea. it has. I think that
plenty of evidence can bo brought to
prove that men were waited upon much
more years ago than they are now.
-â¢rofessor Giddingsâ l have seen some
thing of life In ih.e tenements in this city,
and I have" seen far more numerous in
stances of an almost abject servitude on
the part of the wife and the daughterj
in some of these poorer tenements to-day
than I ever saw among poor peoplÂ« in my
boyhood. If we compare the same classes
I think It true that men and children gen
erally are more waited upon to-day than
they wore thirty years ago.
Mrs. Hensleyâ l do not think that is so
in cur station of life.
Professor Giddingsâ Well, as I observe
children, their habits and their behavior.
In families that 1 am well acquainted with
and compare them with the lives of chil
dren In my boyhood. I find that the child
of to-day Is less sclf-reMant. He expects
more to be done for him. He demands more
THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES
OF WIVES AN HUSBANDS
THE SECRET OF MAKING HAPPY HOMES
DISCUSSED BY MARRIED MEN AND WOMAN
Does If affect the home as much In the
cafe of a man aa It does In that of a wo
man?
Mrs. Hensleyâ ProbaMy not.
Professor Giddingsâ The trend of mod
ern life as it affects both men and women
is telling very seriously in the home. I
think we must all admit that, and there
fore the question arises whether, grant
ing that the strain of modern life is in
evitable with., the Increase of competition
to which men must be subjected In mak
ing a living for the family, we have
gained anything by opening "all these op
portunities to women and so extending all
that frightful competition. Have we .
gained anything?
Mrs. Hensleyâ There is one very impor
tant point that ought to be considered,
and that is the effect of this change upon
the child. We must think of him In every
consideration of the home.
It is certainly true that the average wo
man gives less time to her home than for
merly. The question la whether she does
not accomplish more for the home and for ,
the child in less time.
Mrs. Hensleyâ She accomplishes more
for the home by spending less time there.
That Is a point I wish to emphasize. But
In considering the duties of both mother
and father to the child it is worth whilo
to ask whether we are deriving sufficient
benefit from the improved conditions of
modern life to Justify us in handing down
to our children certain nervous tendencies â¢
and In subjecting them to. a home at
mosphere which must be altered for the
worse to some extent by the condition of
the parents, due to their overstrain.
That seems â¢to me a very Important
point.
Professor Giddingsâ There are two or
three facts which give us an answer to â¢
that. They are statistical facts. We
know, for example, that the birth rate
not soe why she should put anything elsÂ©
before that.
There 'Is one thing; that sunirests Itself to
me In this discourse on the birth rate. Is the
decrease due to the fact that marriages oc
' cur later In life than they did formerly?
Professor Glddingsâ Yes, that Is a very
important reason.
Is the late marriage a good thing for the
home life?
Mrs. Hensley â Later marriages are not
a good thing.
In Inte marriages Is the home life better?
Are people apt to be more happy?
Mrs. Hensleyâ Personally I think not. I
think that early marriages are natural
and desirable.
Judge Truaxâ The entrance of women
Into business undoubtedly has an effect In
reducing the birth rate. You will notice
that of the women in business very few
\ have families. They' cannot afford it.
Suppose that a woman is a stock* broker.
She cannot afford to have children, be
cause she mifrbt be busy with the children
Ht the very time when her whole fortune
was at. stake.
TJ-en tills Is ,i particular In which thÂ«
home has pufferr-d from modern conditions?
Mrs. Ilensleyâ Perb#ps so. yes.
Judge Truaxâ lf a woman Is making
$10,000 a year by her own efforts, I do not
care whether it Is by manual or mental
effort, she Is not going to run the risk
of putting herself In a position to lose the
opportunity of making that income. She
will sacrifice the duties of home for the
money, or it may be for her professional
or artistic success. There is bound' to be
an interference between the two rival
interests, 'and the home is the one that Is
s 'likely to suffer.
"We were speaking of physical degenera
tion. - Do you not think that intelligence la
Increasing?
Professor Giddingsâ lt Is perfectly pos
sible for intelligence to Increase In bodies
that are on the whole weak and sickly.
It is Impossible for Intelligence to Increase
at an extraordinary rate In the existing
generation, except at the expense of fu
ture generations. It Is like. the case of
cities that borrow "money ad lib. and al
low their descendants to pay it. I would
like to say that pretty nearly my whole
philosophy on this subject could be sum
med up in the statement that the multi
plication of opportunities for women is
literally a big drawing on the future. Our
children will Slave to pay a big price for
â¢it.
Mrs. Crplyâ l quite believe It.
Mrs. Hensleyâ But in what way. Mrs.
Croly?
Mrs. Crolyâ l think it is the result of ,
the failure of the men of a previous gen
eration and up to the present time to
adequately consider the value of the
â¢home, the value of the mother and the
value of thechildrenâ in.short. the value of
the horr.Â«Â» as it existed. Thcv dl- nor con-
the running of the house without any In
terference from the husband, and that tne
husband In like manner shall always do
the final Judge, though naturally askin,,
and desiring the advice and the sugges
tions of his wife, as to any point of busi
ness that affects his income or his profes
sional duty or anything of that sort. Now
that is a division of labor that will go a
long way toward making a happy home.
Then there Is one other thing, and that
is that it will be a pretty hard struggle to
make a happy home if the breakdown of
the wife and mother is constantly stand
ing before the household as a specter. If
she Is constantly overdoing it Is pretty
hard for those engaged about her to be
happy. I have been engaged in the col
lege teaching of both men and women for
nine years. One observation that I have
made is that women give out much earlier
than men do, because they have not the
?ame healthy instinct of when to stop
that a man has. A girl gets so interested
in her work or examination that she keeps
right on when it would be better for her
to let up a little, as the boy would do.
Mrs. Hensleyâ Apropos of something you
said Just before that, is it your opinion
that women are going out of tho home too
much? Does not a woman, by excluding
herself from the world, by domesticating
herself too much, interfere with the hap
piness of the home? Which Is the worse?
Professor Giddingsâ l don't know that I
could say which is worse. One was the
error of the past generation, the other Is
the error of this generation. Both are
extremes.
Mrs. Hensleyâ One point that you made
when you were speaking of your experi
ence with college boys and girls Is Inter
esting. You say that the girl is apt to
lay too much emphasis upon detail rather
than upon getting a good general idea of
things. Is that, in . your estimation, a
feminine characteristicâ that lack of per
spective?
Professor Giddingsâ l used the word de
tail with reference to her specific Interest
In special details rather than her perfect
ana systematic grasp of all details. I
Ehould say that women are far more fond
of generalization than men. They are far
more fond of a nlcÂ© system of thought.
They are a great deal more deductive in
their method of thought and a great deal
less inductive than the men. Women care
more for definite reasons and facts than
men do. contrary to tho general supposi
tion. Another common fallacy Is that men
are better reasoners than women. I should
say that women are far more likely to
reason correctly from fallacious premises,
and men far more likely to reason badly
from correct premises, the results being
equally objectionable.
Judge Truaxâ l am not convinced that
women are better reasoners than men. I
do not recall any great logical work writ
ten by a woman. It was not a woman
who wrote Aristotle's "Polities" or Plato's
works or Bacon's "Essays." Take the
things that nearly all educated women do
a little of: they do not do them as well
ness. When a man and a woman asreej to
marry they enter into a contract. will
rot say anything about sacramental mar
rioge: Ido not believe In that They
promise to do certain things, and If they
Oo no: do them one or the other 13 a liar.
They do not keep their pledges. Now.
men and women ought to have a certain
of moral fiber and strength of
character to meet their pled* es to do
what they said they would do. On he
contrary, in many cases, when anything
Â£ wrong they go all to pieces" mentally
and simply act like children. Further
more they often confess that they are at
tTelr wlts ? end to try to bring about a bet
ter understanding. Finally they yield to
wha- I regard as an utterly false and an
essentially low conception of love-a most
hysterical and almost pathological k.r. I
cf love. They do not seem to care at all
sometimes see between an old Â«Â»Â» Â»*
an old woman who have lived
many years. That a man should be reaUy
SEKn by the loss of a wife who has been
with him for twenty-five or thirty jears
is something one can understand. Triat
kind of affection is worth while. But IT a
man goes out and shoots himself or a
woman goes and takes poison because dis
appointed in love in the ordinary sense,
they are not fully developed human wr
ings. They lack a certain sternness or
fiber which is essential to full grown man
hood # or womanhood.
Do yoa thrnk. Judge Traax. tJÂ»*t It would
bÂ« a good thing for divorce to bÂ« made eas
ier by iruUiK It for other cÂ»uÂ»eÂ» tH*a
adultery T
Judge Truaxâ l do not think It should
be allowed for any other cause. No other
grounds are recognized In the State ot
New York, and I think that we havo an
excellent divorce law. If you look up tha
matter you will find that there axÂ© com
paratively few divorces In thÂ« Stata ot
New York. â
Mrs. Crolyâ When people marry thÂ«y
face a new condition which Is a very great
test of character, and they should not fly
off at the first little disagreement that
makes Its appearance, as do the majority
of those w.fao seek divorce. The divorce*
are nearly' always In the early yÂ»arÂ» oC
married life. It does not seem to bÂ« that
men and women have any right to maka
the public shoulder the responsibility for
their hysterical conditions. They ought,
as you say, to have strength of mind
enough to look at the circumstances and
see If they cannot improve the situation.
Marriage is a great teat both of men and
women, and if there is any virtuÂ© In tham
whatever It develops and strengthens
their best characteristics in time.
Mrs. Hensleyâ You have spoken of tha
people who fly to divorce in a moment's
passion, but the fact remains that thera
privileges and attaches a much higher
importance to himself than the child did
in my boyhood. He is less Independent,
as he expects to be taken care of.
How do you account for that?
Professor Giddingsâ l think that as fast
as a people acquires wealth and leisure It
allows itself to get soft in a good many
ways and to lose a good many of the vir
tues of independence and hardihood which
it possessed in its earlier days. That is a
very general explanation. I do .not know
that I am prepared to give a detailed ex
planation.
Now, Mrs. Hensley, you heard Professor
Glddlnps make the point that a woman en-
Eaprd In work outside the homeâ assuming
that she has children In addition to the or
dinary duties of the householdâ cannot care
for the borne as well as the woman of a
generation ago, who had do outside duties.
Do you agree?
Professor Giddingsâ She cbuld not care
for it in the same way and to the same
degree. Let me make that just a little bit
clearer. The woman of a generation ago
had a great many duties. She worked
hard, assuming now that she was a
woman in at least the middle rank of so
cietyâa conscientious woman with some
education. She had a great many duties
and was a hard-working woman; but life
as a whole did not make as many de
mands upon her as it makes on a woman
to-day, partly because she did not have
so many opportunities.
Would you say that for that reason *he
was better able to take care of her home?
Professor Glddingsâ For that reason
was able to care for her home fairly well,
notwithstanding all tho work she did.
while tc-day if she must go out of her
home to earn money, either in a factory
or store or in professional life, she accom
plishes relatively the same amount of
work an/1 discharges relatively the same
number of obligations, but these are not
all in the household.
Judge Truaxâ A woman who wishes to
go out and work in business or a profes
sionâlf she can make money enoughâ may
hire another woman to take care of her
house. 1 should think, though, that her
absence must injure the home life, espe
cially if she has children. She cannot
take care of those children if she Is off
to the wars, can she? She may hire an
other woman to do her housework, but.
she cannot hire a woman to be a mother
to her children.
Mrs. Hensley- The woman of twenty or
thirty years ago who worked all the time
in her home worked very ignorantly and
unscientifically. We must take that fact
into consideration. The woman of to-day
by the systematic care of her home and
the careful apportionment of her hours
requires very, much less time to do the
work than she did in those days.
Professor' Gidriingsâ But how many
women are there to-day who understand
the art of systematizing their time, who
have a scientific knowledge of the prepa
ration of food, fps instance? How many
such women to-day are engaged in solving
the problem of combining their ordinary
occupations with housekeeping? Is it not
a comparatively small number?
Mrs. Hensley â I think there are a good
many. But they will not be found among
the very poor or the very rich. Of course
if they were rich they would not be do
ing It, and If they were poor they could
not. But you will find them among the
middle clays â the people in moderate cir
cumstances. \
â¢ Professor Giddingsâ Undoubtedly. But
turn the question about. Of the women
employed in money making occupations
how many give or have given any atten
tion to scientific housekeeping
Mrs. Hensleyâ The progressive womanâ
the bright, all around. Intelligent woman
âconsiders it essential to know house
keeping and to know the right way to care
for her children.
Professor Giddingsâ There are certain
tests that we can applyâ not positive ones,
but negative ones. Are women to-day
happier than they were a generation ago?
Mrs. Herisleyâ They are happier, I think,
undoubtedly. They are more. intelligent.
Professor Giddincsâ Let us grant that
That certainly is not the only element of
happiness.
Mrs. Hensleyâ Her value to her home
and to her husband is increrslng.
Professor Glddingsâ l have never been
able to seÂ£ or to believe that values can be
increased In this life without the increase
of cost. We have to pay for them, and
many things indicate that the Increased
value of woman is being created at an
enormous increase ip cost to herself.
Mrs. Hensleyâ ln health, do you mean?
Professor Glddingsâ l refer to health,
and more particularly 'to nervous health.
In resistance to ordinary disease woman
t8 undoubtedly sharing the progress of
the race due to better sanitary conditions
and other causes; but I understand from
the medical men who make a specialty of
nervous diseasesâ and we ascertain the
same thins? from statisticsâ that nervous
diseases aro increasing relatively to pop
ulationâthat is, increasing more rapidly
than population.
Mrs. Hensley â Is there any. larger pro
portion of women who are suffering from
nervous diseases than of men? To what
cause do you attribute the Increase in
. women?
/ Piolfssor Giddingsâ l attribute It to' tho
fact that woman Is confronted with vastly
Increased opportunities and that the effort
to improve them brings upon her a great
strain.*'
Mrs. Hensleyâ lf that Is your position,
then truly you are maligning nature.
When she created us with strong, healthy
bodies did she intend that the brain should
be left idle in order that these bodies
should be wholesome and strong? â¢
Professor Giddings â I am sure I do not
know what nature may have Intended.
Mrs. Hensleyâ l believe I know. lam
sure that it is not a question of our men
tal growth at all if .we are becoming a
prey to nervous diseases. It is the woman
who does not so arrange her time that
she can get the full amount of good from
each one of these opportunities who gives
way under the nervous strain. It Is the
woman who is flitting from one thing to
another.
Professor Giddingsâ My observation
shows that it Is just the other way about.
It is not the unsystematic woman who is
the sufferer from nervous diseases. It is
the systematic woman, who. goes about
things In the most methodical way, and
because she is methodical thinks that she
can do everything under the heavens, and
never stops.
Here is an Important point. . If women are,
'less healthy than they were a generation
CRo, and are less capable, or perhaps have
less opportunity, of caring for the home,
it is something that directly and very'seri
ously affecta the race. No. is It true that
women aro less healthy than they were?
There Is certainly a great increase of ner
vouÂ« diseases.'
Mrs. Crclyâ There are three men with
nervous complaints to one woman who 13
so afflicted.
THE SUNDAY CALTj.
shows very marked changes !n France,
England and the United States, if we
compare the present -with twenty or thirty
years ago. Kverywhere we find a dimin
ishing birth rate. We know, further, that
the proportion of males and females in
the birth rate i 3 a variable ratio. It dif
fers from time to time, and it differs if
you compare one class In society with an
other clas3 and if you compare one com
munity with another community. We
know also that, on the whole, a large
proportion .of males in the birth rate is
found where the women lead hardy lives.
It is found among the peasantry. If Is
found where the women are engaged In
healthy out of door labor and in house
keeping of the old-fashioned sort. Where
the women lead an easy and luxurious
life, where they are engaged very largely
In sedentary occupations, you will find a
larger proportion of females in the birth
rate. Then, finally, we know that along
with a large proportion of females in '.the
birth rate goes a tendency toward a large
number of changes, which are lumped un
der the slang word, "degeneration." I
Will not say this as a necessary fact. 1
will not raise the question of causation at
all, because we do not know enough about
it to settle that question. Now, these
things we know, and that Is all.
Mrs. Hensleyâ ls It true of the world
generally or of one particular class, that
wherever there i's a preponderance of
girls, born there is an accompanying pre
ponderance of degeneration?
Professor Giddlngs â Those are the com
munities that show. the' phenomena of ef
feminacy or degeneracy on the whole. In
other words, the hardy and enduring peo
ple have on the whole a larger proportion
of males in tho birth rate.
Mrs. Hensleyâ The hardy and enduring
people ha-vo hardy and enduring mothers
necessarily. I want, to remove the stigma
that seems from your remarks to attach
itself to womanhood.
IProf essor Giddingsâ l do not mean to
Imply that a maTked increase In the birth
of girls necessarily has the effect of de
generacy. I mean to Eay that the two
things in a general way go together.
Have you any opinion on this subject?
Professor Giddings â None that I am pre
pared to express.
Judge Truaxâ Professor Glddings has
touched upon an important matter In ref
erence to the decreasing birth rate. The
more women there are in business the
fewer children there will be in the world.
You may Invent machines that will do the
household work and you may Invent ma
chines that will tuke carp of the children
after they aro born, but you cannot get
any machine to take the place of women
in bearing children. Personally I do not
believe that a woman ever can make as
great a success in any other profession as
she can in that of being a woman. There
Is no objection to her taking up any kind
of work that she can do, but it seems to
mo that the work of being a wife and
mother is the grandest work in the world,
and It Is the work/that woman alone can
do. There she has no competitor. I do
sldor that it had a value. They made the
woman a subject. They liked the daugh
ters to live in the home and perform the
work of the home without remuneration.
The result of it was that the woman has
ceased to value this home. She has gone
out of the home to get that which she
could not get at home. That was appre
ciation, remuneration and compensation
for nor life and her work. The daughters
have left the home to earn money else
where. I frequently hear men' patheti
cally wish that the "old"' woman would
come back; that they could go back -to
the old home that they had, to the wife
that existed years and years ago, and to
the daughters that made their home like
sunshine. Well, they have lost that, and
It has been the result of their failure to
put a value upon it. If they had put a
pr- â¢ valu3 upon it the woman and the
daughters would have remained in the
home and would have worked in it.
Professor Gidrtings â There is too much
truth in that.
Mrs. Hensleyâ But progress has taken
the woman's work away from the home.
What would she do without outside inter
ests?
Mrs. Crolyâ There Is plenty of work in
the home still. There is work to be done
besides making candles and preserves
which never should have been made. I
have soon homes and I know homes that
are just bits of paradise, and that is be
cause the woman Is there ana because the
man appreciates and values the woman
and the home.
Do you think. Mrs. Croly. that the home
is suffering: by this movement?
Mrs. Crolyâ l think it is suffering, but
I think that the process is one of evolu
tion that could not be prevented or avoid
cm. I havo been a working woman for
iifty years and directed a home during
the whole of that time, and I know that
I have seen all sides of this question. I
have felt that my children would suffer
and did suffer from my absence.
AVhat do you think Is essential for a happy
home for a woman? What makes a happy
home?
Mrs.' Hensley â A comrade or chum for
a husband; freedom for herself absolutely
and children whom she can rear in the
way she thinks best.
Â¦\Vhat do you think is essential in the hus
band?
Mrs. Hensleyâ The same thing, to be
sure. â¢
Professor Glddings, will you give your
ideas on that?
Professor Glddingsâ Of, course, I agree
that the first essential is the one that Mrs.
Hensley named firstâ a wife who is a
comrade. Secondly. I should say^ 1 children
who are a pride and a comfort. Third
coming down to the material and prac
tical side of the thing-^there must be a
certain natural and spontaneous agree
ment between husband and wife on prac
tical questions. If they have got to come
to an agreement as the result of too much
argument and negotiation it takes a great
deal out of life. There is probably no one
thing that will conduce so much to that
end as an understanding between husband
and wife that the wife shall have a defi
nite income or a definite allowance, and
be solely and absolutely responsible for
as men do. Nine women play the piano to
one man who does so, but the greatest pi
anists are men. You will find nine women
who can paint a little er draw a little to
one man who can do so, but the greatest
painters have been men. Women may
try to be whatever they choose, but their
greatest success will continue to be found
in being womenâ wives and mothers.
There are certain well-marked tendencies
that affect the home. We made mention of
the matter of later marriages. The fact that
marriage does not take place as early now as
it did formerly, is due. partly, at least, to
thÂ» groat growth of club life, both for men
and women.' Another cause U tho entrance
of women into various employments. Do
not these outside a!Taira make the home lesj
Â» center of Interest than it was formerly?
Mrs. Hensley â Yes. that would seem to
be the tendency.
Mrs. Crolyâ l do not think that it is true,
so far as club life is concerned. On the
contrary, I really tblnk that the club life
has rather increased the interest that the
women have in the various departments
of their homes. Through club associa
tions a woman learns to do certain
things that she Oid not know before, and
her home becomes a new center' of inter
est to her. She learns how to do thihg3
because she is told by some other woman.
She finds out new ways of doing things
and of making her home life more happy
by bringing outside element's into it. I
have made a long study of home life so
far as the clubs are concerned. I have no
ticed that ninety-five, per cent of the mem
bers of the .women's clubs are married.
There Is one Interest inu thing: that we have
not touched upon yet. and that Is ths ques
tion of divorce. Dr. Savage was quoted re
cently as sayinsr. apropos of the proposed
amendment .to the marriage law In this
State", that he believed that marriage sh-mld
be made more difficult and divorce easier.
Mrs. x Crolyâ I do not believe in divorco
at all.
Mrs. Hensleyâ Do you believe that the
man and the woman who have become
distasteful to each other should remain
to the end of their lives living In the kind
"of atmosphere that mutual dislike or dis
agreement must create?
Mrs. Crolyâ l do not believe that the
man and woman who have made mistaken
marriages, who have children perhaps
have any right to charge their own mis
takes upon the shoulders of the commu
nity. I do not believe that the woman
has any right to deprive her children of
a father, nor the man any right to de
prive them of a mother. In regard to the
man and woman who have made one mis
take, there Is no certainty that they
would not make another if they had the
chance. I think, from all that I have seen
of the hundreds of people who try to come
together again after tttey have been di
vorced, that the very best thing for them
as well as for the community is to accept
the situation and accustom themselves to
it in the best way they can
Professor Giddings-I think that the in
crease of divorce is- not only an evil in
itself but that It is an indication of a
moral weakness most humiliating. Di
vorce shoulcl be regarded exactly as bank
ruptcy in business Is regardedâ as a most
humiliating confession of moral weak-
Is another side of the picture* I san now
taking the question of men and women
of intelligence, who axÂ© not hysterical,
but of good common sense. Suppose such
a man and Â¦woman find after three or
four years that they are absolutely un
sulted to each other. Or we will take thÂ»
case where one of the two finds that thÂ«
other Is absolutely distasteful to h!Â«n or
her. Now the question Is whether It Is
right or justifiable that these* two should
live together, that she should bear chil
dren to himâ unwilling children, of course,
they would be. In the Interest of ths
race, is it right?
Professor Giddingsâ l am not able to
see. in th? light of historical facts, that
it makes any difference to the race. It
makes a difference to individuals, but a
irreat deal Is said about injuring the rac<*
through the bearing of unwillingly born
children. Xow. if that la th# case, the
race ought to have come to grief long:
ngo, because in ancient times whenever
one tribe, or nation overcame another the
conouerora appropriated the women to
themxelves and we are all descended from
mothers that- were appropriated in Just
that way.
Mrs. Crolyâ l havo ho doubt myself that
there are many cases of suffering caused
by unwise marriages to-day, but I doubt
very much If occasional cases of Individ
ual suffering are sufficient to counterbal
ance the enormous injury that Is done to
society by free divorce.
Mrs. Hensleyâ l believe in marriage, and
I think that divorce t* a horrible thing,
but I have more confidence In men and
women than to think that the mere legal
bond is going to hold them together. Love,
and love only, will accomplish that.,
Po you think that If divorces were not so
easily obtained husbands and wives would
not think so soon of separation?
Professor Glddingsâ I do not brtieve that
men and women are influenced by law
nearly so much as is commonly sup
posed. I confess I am heretic an this
point. A change in the law would not
make any difference.
You thlr.k that the change mutt coma
from a char.Ke !n the nttitade of society In
general toward the subjectâ that divorce Is
so to speak, a fad?
Professor Giddlngs-We have epidemic.
In thought and feeling Just as much am
wo have in fashion. If it is in the air so
to speak, for people to quarrel and get'dl
vorcos. they will do so. If it i 3i 3 not they

4Representative, the committee appointed to
call on the retiring President, who had Just
signed his last bill !n his room close by, en
tered and announce. l that he had no further
messases for the Senate, and extended his
congratulations to fc&th Houses of Congress
upon the termination cf their tobors. The
United States had been without a ruler for
twenty minutes when the a?sistant doorkeeper
announcfd the Vice I'restdent. Two pages
drew back the doors, and Mr. Hobart entered
on the arm of a Senator and took the seat on
the marble dais beside his predecessor, who
still occupied the chair of the presidtr.s officer
of the Senate. Then there was another lor.ir
wait, durlns which the people in the galleries
gossiped loudly and" the Senators yawned.
Finally the President, after being- formally
announced, entered arm In arm with the re
tiring President. Mr. Cleveland. Both looked
very republican. Indeed, especially poor Mr.
Cleveland, who toiled along with the gout, lean-
Ing what he- could of his massive figure upon an
umbrella. The women stood up and with one
accord pronounced their new President aa
good-locking as he undoubtedly was strong and
amiable and firm and calm and pious. The
new VlcÂ« President took the oath of office,
and after the necessary speeches and the
proclamation for an extra session, the new
Senators were sworn In. and Betty wondered
how any man would dare to break so> solemn an
oath.

had made up a day trying to the stoutest
nerves, and more than one person had fainted

affected her so powerfully that her ego seeme<t
deaJ. she wag only conscious of looking dowrÂ»
upon hist.iry. It seemed to her for the first
time she fully realized the tremendous Issues
involved In the calling of that roll of name*.
The attitude o" the American people. whl?h>
she had deprecated and scorned, was dtgnlflerl
by the attitude of that historical body below
her. Even Senator North did not inherent her
frr the moment. The Senate for the time, waa
a unit. " v -
It seemed to her an Interminable Interval be
tween the last echo of thÂ« rumhllnar vnteÂ« of
the clerk who had read the resolution amended
by the report of the conferees and the first ran
corous, exasperated note .of the secretary, after
a brief colloquy between Senators. The secre
tary calls* the roll of the Senate at all times
as if he hated every member of It. aad to

Betty felt the blood throb In her ears as sha

While Mrs. Atherton will never bÂ« out

"Senator North" Is a book that will be

careful arraneerru-nt and the hand of a
clex-er writer, but unfortunately there is
the mark of the dollars and cents about
it; upon reading it there arises the feel
ing that Mrs. Atherton has not thrown
herself heart and soul into the workâ has
not written t<< please hers.-lf but to pro
due a book that, in h^r opinion, would
prove acceptable to the purse of the mul
titude. There is a lack of spontaneity
end freshneF= about It that characterized
those camo "earlier r-fforts" whi^h Mrs.
Atherton unfortunately found larking in
remunerative returns. Nevertheless there
is much of value and inteT-^t to he found
Â¦within Its pages. Mrs. Atherton is not
artificial and nor p^n pictures of life at
the national capital possess a genuine
ness and warmth of coloring that render
them strikingly r*>al and convincing.
"Senator North" has for its major
theme American national politics, with
a minor chord upon thÂ«Â» social evil exist
ing Jn the South of unfortunate mesalll
snes between th" whites and blacks. The
latter is introduced for two reasons, first.
to impart a dramatic interest to the story.
and second, because Mrs. Atherton evi
dently rnuFt always have a thread of
pcandal or social reform to weave into
her literary cloth.
The ch?.ra<-tr>r of the book is its heroine.
Betty Madison, a Southern girl of blue,
blood, who ttorvirnes Interested In national
politics, who lives in Washington and Is
anxious to establish a salon. She is a
heroine of Tt years, and falls in love with
Fenator North, the loader of the enn-
Fervarivo demerit of the Senate, a Re
publican, a man of 50. and married to an
invalid wife. Three men figure in the
â¢=Tory a.Â« leading charactersâ Senator
North. Senator Burleiirh from the Middle
West nr.d of 'he opposition, and Jack
Emory, a cnu.-in of Betty'?, with all the
haughty pride of the Southerner and race
"ha ! red "of the negro. Senator North is
well drawn and pivos foundation for the
hope that Mrs. Atherton has slightly
changed her views regarding American
men from thÂ«* opinion she ernressed in
writing to the I^ondon Daily News in 1556,
r.-V!*>n fhe Â«aid:
'"The v.TÂ«=t majority of American men
r.ro composed of two elements only â
money gr>^od aiVl sensuality. They are at
the very b^crinnincs of thir own develop
ment, the mort elemental race of men in
all civilization to-day.
'.'American women have so far flashed
past thorn that they stand on the piano
which Endifih wom^n would occupy if
they had kept pace with their men. They
are alive to their finger tips: the.y havo
cast off the yoke of conventionality, cut
r.nd-dried religion and all the old forms
j?nd tradition? which should lie and must
become obrolete as the higher civiliza
tion rropres=e?."
Betty Madison is of th<Â» type "alive to
'her finger tips." with "tÂ«eth as brilliant as
her eyes" and with "a mane of warm
brown hnlr." Phe roaches the conviction
thnt it <Â¦= the duty of an American girl to
be Informed upon matters political and

to be haf.py and respected. Could duty be more
plain? And was she a chosen instrument to
right one at leapt of the great wrongs per
petrated by the brilliant, warm-hearted, reck
lfrF* men cf ber race?
Hut in a moment Fhe shuddered and dropped
the letter, a wave of horror and disgust rising
within hÂ«;r. This rirl was her sister, and was.
light or dark, a negress. Betty had seen itoo
much of the world in her twenty-seven years
to weep on the discovery of her father's weak
ness, or to phrink from a woman so unhappy as
to be birn out of wedlock, but eh* was a South
ern to her finger tlpÂ«: the blacks were a de
spised, an unspeakably inferior race, and they
had been slaves for hundreds of years to the
white man. To be sure, she loved the old fam
ily servants and rarely said a harsh word to
them, and .it was a matter of indifference to
her that they had been freed, as she had plenty
of money to pay their wages. But that tho
rifgro should vote had always seemed to her
incredible and monstrous, and 6he lauzhed ta
hf ruelf when fhe met on the streets the smartly
dressed colored people out for a walk; they
F*>emed farcically unreal, travesties on the
people to whom a discriminating Almighty had
given the world. To her the entire race wero
first slaves, then servants, entitled to all klnd
ne*a Â«o long as they kept their place, but to bÂ«
promptly stepped on the moment they pre
sumed. She recoiled In growing disgust from,
this girl with the hidden drop of black in her
body.

Must she give him up? i What pleasure could
she find In sitting here with him if her mother's
apprehensive mind did not leave the room for a
moment? , What pleasure if a vulgar world
was whiei>erinc? *
She reflected' with some bitterness that one
danger was receding. He had not entered this
room since the day of her return. Although he
had called several times he had come in the
evening, when she always sat with her mother,
or in the morning, when Mrs. Madison was
apaln sure to be present. She knew that he
dared not come hÂ«ye and that it was more than
likely he would never call at the old hour again.
She realized these . two facts suddenly and
vividly, for her mind worked with a brutal
frankness at times. She began to cry heavily,
the tears raining on her Intellectual mood and
obliterating it. If she were not to Bee him,
alone, again, she might as well ask him to only
come to the house on Thursday evenings and
to show her no attention in' public; If she could
not have the oltf hours again she wanted noth
ing less. And she wanted tnem passionately.
Those hour* came back to her with a polng
nancy of happiness in memory that the present
had not revealed, and the thought that they
had gone forever filled her with a suffocating
anguish that was an complete as It was sudden.
She implored him under her breath to come to
her: then prayed that he would not. .-
She became conscious that she was in a mood
to Â¦ take any step, were hÂ» here, rather
than lose him, and the mood terrified her.
Would the time come ! when this intoler
able c-nin would kill every Inheritance in
her brain, its empire the more absolute because
it made passion Itself insignificant in the more
terrible want of the heart? If, It did she would

The President W33 not given time to exhaust
diplomacy with although In his war
message he was obliged to state that he had
done so. .To deal successfully with a proud
and medieval country required months, not
days, and as Spain had grudgingly but surely
yielded all alonj tho line to the demands of
the United States it Is safe to assume that
ehe would have peacefully withdrawn her forces
from Cuba if her pride could have been saved.
Sagasta was working in the Interests of peace,
but a bigoted old country, too Indolent to read
history and puzzled at a youthful nation's in
dustry In the cause of humanity, would move
bo fast and no faster.
The President was rushed off his feet and
his hand was forced. An honest but delirious
country was threatening impeachment and
clamoring for war. Us representatives were
hammering on the doors of the White House
and shrieking in Congress. A dishonest press
was inflaming it and injuring it In the eyes
of the world by assaulting the integrity of the
executive and of the leading men in both
houses; ard unscrupulous politicians were ex
tracting every possible party advantage until
it looked as if the Democratic party, rent
asunder by Mr. Bryan and his doctrines, would
be unified once more. Th* House, after the
President's calm and impersonal message on
the Maine report, acted like a mutinous school
of bad boys whÂ» had not been tausht the first
principles of breeding and dignity: t!w* few
gentlemen in It hardly tried to make themselves
heard, and even the Speaker was powerless to
quell a couple of hundred tempers all rampant
morse and fanaticism and the man torn
between conflicting emotions of love for
his wife and proverbial Southern hatred
of the blood that flows in her veins. Un
fortunately the mere fact is brought out
that Harriet has told him and that" he has
rushed out into the night and is gone.
Mrs. Atherton has missed a splendid op
portunity to do some of the powerful
writing of which she is perfectly capable.
In fact, the story of Harriet and Emory
could form a book in itself, and a most
interesting one at that. As it Is, there are
some very strong scenes presented in the
tragedy of their lives, and the character
of Harrietâ a strange blend of good and
evilâ is remarkably well drawn.
Betty returns to Washington and estab
lishes a salon, where she receives all the
nation's representatives and political dis
cussions run rife. She is much aged by
subsequent happenings in the deplorable
marriage of her cousin and half-sisterâ
which it is well to leave for Mrs. Ather
ton'to tellâ and upon being criticized by
her mother for her conduct with Senator
North decides to marry Burleigh, who has
been pressing his suit. She feels that she
is not strong enough to resist forever her
feelings toward North and that she must
go away. Mrs. Atherton has done some
fine work in plausibly presenting the evo
lution in the personality of hen- heroine
from the cold-blooded, intellectual young
Washington society belle to the woman
who learns to know what love really la

following the Impulse of duty brings the
girl to her home. Book' two is taken up
with tne happenings in the Adlrondacks,
where the family go for the summer.
Betty and North find their admiration of
each other turned into love and are
placed In the unpleasant position of a
mutual realization of the other's affection
with the knowledge. that there can be lit
tle hope of closer relations; for Mrs.
North, while an invalid, is In no particu
lar danger of a sudden demise. ' Tho first
love scene of the book is unique and well
written. Betty end North are taking a
row upon the lake and the conversation
lias turned upon affairs of the heart:
"Do you love anybody now?" she broke out.
"Is there a woman in your life? Some one
who makes you happy?"
The Fmlie left his lir>s. It was too much to
cay that it had been in hig eyes, but they
cl>ar-ed also. Â«
"There Is no woman In my life, as you put
It. Why do you ask?"
"Becaufe I wont to know."
They regarded each other squarely. In a
moment he paid deliberately: "The greatest
happiness that I have had in the past few
month 3 ha* been my friendship with you. If
I wrrt free I should make love to you. If
you will have the truth I can concelve.no
happiness ro great an, to be your husband. ' I
ha\ - e caucht myself dreaming of Itâ and over
and over again. -But as it Is I am not coins
to make love to you. When the strain becomes
too great I shall leave you. Until thenâ ah.
Betty, who had dropped her head when he
began to Fi>eak. had raised it slowly, and her
face concealed nothing.
"I, too. love you," she said in a moment.
"I Â»ove you, I' love you. If you know what a
relief it is to say It. That Is the reason I
would not go up Into the forest with you Just
now. I was afraid. I have been with you
there too often."
For the firEt time she saw the muscles of his
face relax, and she covered her face with her
hands. "I shouldn't have told you." she said,
"I shouldn't have told you. 1 hare made It
harder. You will go away at once."
He did not Epeak for some minutes. Then
he said:
' "Can you do without what we have?"
"Oh, no!" she said passionately. "Oh, no!
no!" . -..--.
"Nor can Iâ without the hope and the pros
pect of an occasional hour with you, of â¢ the
sympathy and understanding which has grown
up between us. I have conquered myself many
time?, relinquished many hopes, and I think
and believe that my self-control Is as great
as a man's can be. I shall not let myself go
with you unlers you tempt me beyond endur
ance: for, as I said before â if I find that I am
not strong enough I phall leave you. You are
a beautiful and seductive woman and your
power, if you choose to exert It, would madden,
any man. Will you forget It? Will you help
me?"
She dropped her hards. "Yes." she said. "I'd
rather suffer anything. I'd rather make myself
over than do without you. And I couldn't!
I couldn't! Every least thing that happens I
want to co straight to you about it. I know
that trouble la ahead, although I haven't ad
mitted it before. I want you In every way! in
every way! and I can't even have you in that.
I will never speak like this again, but I'd like
you to know. If you love me you must know
how terrible It Is. I am not a child. I am
27 years old."
"I know," he said, and for a few moments
he said no more, but looked down into the
water. >' -.â¢;'.â¢ Â¦Â¦':
"Washington politicians. Some quite unique
conversations pass between mother ana

particularly edifying, will doubtless prove
interesting to our English cousins who

In spite of the opposition of her mother
and her cousin. Jack Emory. Betty per
sists in her intention and gradually works,
into the political life of Washington. She
is greatly Impressed with Senator North,
a man who â¢â¢did not look as if he had
over hurried or wasted his energies or lost
bla self-control in his life. His face was
impenetrable: his eyes, black and pierc
ing were wholly without that limpidity
which reveals depths and changes of ex
pression: his mouth was closely set and
betrayed neither tenderness nor humor.
If possible he stood even more squarely
on his feet than the other men. He had
the powerful, thick-set figure which in
variably harbors strong passions."
The .story is laid just prior to the inau
guration of President McKlnley. and cov
ers the political per'.od from that time to
the declaration of war with Spain. Hav
ing her leading character imbued with an
ardent desire for political knowledge gives
the author an excellent opportunity for
the propounding- of personal opinions
through the mouths of her puppets. The
book is filled with arguments upon the
question of Cuba and the war with the
Spaniards. Senators Xorth and Burleigh
both spend much of their time in enlight
ening Betty and as they are antagonistl
cal in their views the reader can take his
choice of the arguments.

personality of North and his remarkable
mentality." Then happens an event which
brings them yet closer together. She feels
hers<lf called upon to ask him for advice
and aid. The minor chord in the story
is touched and the tragedy develops.
Betty receives a letter from a minister
about to die. who informs her that he
must turn over to her his charge â that
she has an illegitimate sister whose
mother was a negress. although thÂ»
daughter is whit#. Mrs. Atherton has
well depicted the general sentiment of the

this letter on the young Southern girl.

"In dealing with methodical scoundrels you

It a compact?" $
"I will keen my part of It. ' I promise to be

I am not going to disgrace it by ruining the
only happiness I shall ever have. I love you
and will prove It by making your part as easy
as I can and by giving you all the happiness
I am permitted to."
He leaned toward her for the first time, but
he did not touch her.
"And.l promise you this., my darling," he
said softly: "If you should ever be In great
trouble and should send for meâ as of course
you would doâ l will promise to' take you In

peats with me and I will row you part of the
way home. I shall get out a half-mile from
the hofel. There was really no reason why
you should have made me walk nearly the en
tire lencth of the lake."
Meantime Jack Emory and Betty's un
fortunate half-sister Harriet have been
secretly married without his having been,
informed of her dreadful secret. Their
"marriage, through the curiosity of a pry
ing housekeeper, becomes known, and one
night Harriet, who has been worked up
to a fit of religious frenzy through a camp
meeting In the neighborhood and is tilled
with the fear that some one else will tell
her husband her secret, commits the fatal
error of telling him herself. Here is a
chance for the pen of Mrs. Atherton to
give us a really dramatic situation, to
describe this scene between husband and
wifeâ the woman drunk with religioua re-
and fears Its power. The conflict in her
mind and her ultimate decision is written
with characteristic Athertonlsm:
Even for him Betty reflected that she could
not endure vulgar gceslp. and wondered how
any high-bred woman could for any man.
"For what else doe* civilization mean." she
thought "if those that have its highest advan
tages are not wiser than the mob? And unless
a woman is ready tog o and live in a cave shÂ«
cannot be happy in the loss of the world 8 re
gard, for it can make her uncomfortable In a
thousand little ways. Expediency is the" root
cf all morality. It is stupid to be unmoral,
and that is the long and short of it. I would
marry him to-morrow. If I had to cook for him.
if he were dishonored by his country, if he
were suddenly smitten with 'ill-health and could
never walk again. I am willing to go through
life alone for his sake, even without seeing
him. and after he is dead and gone. I love him
absolutely, and If there is another world I
must meet him. there. But I am not willing to
become a social pariah on his account."
She had never permitted her mind to linger
on the practical aspect of a different relation
ship, but she did so now deliberately. She
kne"w that what her mother had intimated waa
trueâ that the happiness to be got out of It
would amount to very little, and that the day
would come when she would say It was not
worth the price. There were many times when
she was not capable of reasoning coldly on this
subject, but she had been listening to Senator
Ffrench on the restriction of Immigration, and
felt all intellect. Her mind turned to ' Harriet.
There was a creature foredoomed to destruction
by the forces within her. struggling In vain,
assisted and guarded In vain. Should she, with
her Inheritance of kindly forces within and
without, deliberately readjust her manifest
lines into a likeness of Harriet Walker's? And
ghe knew that even if she hoodwinked the
world, the miserable deception of it all, the
nervous terrors, would not only wear love
down, but shatter the ideals of herself and
lilm. Site would be infinitely more miserable
than now.
It relieved her to have thought that phase
marry Burlelgh. She made up her mind In
stantly. She would fight as long as she could,
for she passionately desired to live her Ufa
alone with the Idea of this man: but If she were
not strong enough she would marry and bury
herself In the West. Nothing but an Irrevocable
step would effect a permanent mental attitude,
and Burlelgh would give her. little time for
thought. /
Â«;â¢Â¦: - ? Â¦ . .â¢ ' '. â¢ 'Â¦'Â¦_' â¢'â¢ â¢
Betty drew a long breath. Her cheeks wer*
cool at" last, and she wondered If her heart
were dead. It felt so cold. What mad impulse
had nearly driven her to him to-night, inde
pendently of her will, which had slept, worn
out. like other faculties, by a day of hunger,
excitement, nervous exhaustion and physical
pain. The impulse had risen unhindered and
uncritielzed from her heart, and if it had risen,
r>nce it could rise again. The days to come
would be full of excitement She fancied that
she already heard the roar of cannon, the beat-
Ing of drums, the sobs of women. And below
the racket of Its sad accompanlrsent was always
the low. indignant mutter of a triumphant peo
ple at those who dared to set themselves above
the popular clamor an<i ask fcr sanity. The
Intolerable longing that had become her con
stant companion would be fed by evejy device
and unpropltlous circumstance. Again and
again she would experience this Impulse to go
to him. ani some night the blood would not re
cede' from her brain in time.
She groped her way out of the dark parlor
and down the hall, grateful for an excuse to
walk slowly. Her boudcir was brilliant, and
the struggle cf the last few moments seemed
the more terrible and significant by contrast
with the dainty, luxurious room. She wondered
if she woulj ever dare enter the parlor again
or If it would not always look dark to her.
She sat down at her desk and wrote a letter
It ran:
"Dear Mr. Burlelgh: I will marry you If T**Â»
still wish it. Will you dine with me to-night 7
â¢BETTY MADISON*."
She waa too tired for emotion aa she addressed
and sealed the letter, but *he knew what would
come later. Nevertheless she went to the front
door and asked the watchman to post It. Then
she went to bed.
The story has a conventional endtnsr.
The death of Mrs. North Is opportunely
announced, and of course tha sequel la
easy to guess.

of the characters involved tho reader will

CHAPTER I.
PARIS, like every capital. Is made up
of several towns, some of them very
tiny. Once through the city gates,
particularly on the west, one Is im
mediately in other towns that are still
Paris, or only distinguished from It by
a mere administrative fiction. But these,
for example. Neullly or Lavallols, have the
appearance, the population and the cus
toms of a provincial center. A foreigner
guided to the suburb of St. Charles, ad
joining the Javel quarter, to stroll about
there- for a day before returning to his
own country would carry away with him
a curious Idea of Paris. And yet he would
have visited one of the capital's annexes,
Fltuated within a few rifle shots of the
Arc de Triomphe, and which in ten years,
when the fortifications are demolished,
will be Paris.
St. Charles occupies an angular space on
the left bank of the Seine, between the
river and the belt line of the city. The
Porte de Bas-Meudon forms the apex of
the angle. The principal artery of the
capital Is a continuance of the Rue St.
Charles, twhlch traverses the whole
length of Javel and keeps the name on
the other side of the fortifications.
About sixty out of every hundred Paris
ians would be amazed to learn that the
Rue St. Charles resembles the Rue St.
Denis in the aspect of its houses, the or
namentation of its sidewalks with monu
mental fountains and its commercial ani
mation. The inhabitant of the quarter
purchases all the necessaries of life in this
street. When . his demands exceed the
resources of the, Rue St. Charles shop
keeper, the latter replies to the purchaser
exactly as a colleague In Mantes or Ro
morantln would reply In a similar case:
"I can order it for you from Paris."
And the Inhabitant of St. Charles will
say to his wife In the morning:
"Don't expect me to luncheon; I am
cfrllged to go to Paris."
It may be well to give a few details
about the St. Charlesian; an individual
rarely seen by the Parisian. As In towns
of- the United States, a distinction must be
made between the native autochthonous In
habitant and the Immigrant. St. Charles
is an ancient village. On account of the
slow means of communication It was as
distant from Paris a hundred years ago
as a" village of the Lolret or of the Eure
is to-day. This amounts to saying that in
the Pari3 of Louis XVI the very name of
the village was Ignored; the Inhabitants
were simply agriculturists, of whom many
lived and died without ever having seen
the Louvre.
Several of â¢ these original families of
agriculturists still exist, and are recog
nizable by the names found In numbers
upon the shop signs, names which already
figured upon the ancient parish registers
of the beginning of the seventeenth cen
tury. Froment, Martin, Bahuchet occur
the most frequently. These native Inhab
itants, through some mysterious law
which no one has found interesting
enough to Investigate, are almost all mod
est retail dealersâ tinsmiths, grocers, bak
ers. Not a single Bahuchet, Martin or
Froment Is reputed rich in a commune
where some Immense industrial fortunes
have been built. These all belozur to tha
Immigrants, to the big manufacturers who
have colonized St. Charles from the Revo
lutionary period to the present time, men
who have been and still remain Parisians
from Paris. The Roussln3, whose petro
leum refinery Is In the Rue Dclnrmel. have
their mansion In the Pare Monceau; the
publisher Verdier, whose printing work 3
form part of one side of the Ruo Lacor
dalre, lives near the Trocndero. Jude
Duramberty. tho big manufacturer of
wallpaper, has his factory in the Rue dcs
Vergers, but he lives In a sumptuous Paris
residence In the Rue Francois I. All these
manufacturers go to St. Charles exactly
as the English merchant and tradesman
goes to the city, and none of them even
dreams of living there.
Nevertheless, these factories, ware
houses and shops have had considerable
Influence upon the population. In the
first place, they have Increased it numeri
cally by Introducing two new elementsâ
the clerk and the workman. St. Charles
has gradually passed from the village
Ptage to that of a town and thence to
that of a big provincial city. Its popula
tion to-day exceeds twenty thousand
soulsâ as many as Chartres. Almost all
the clerks of the big workshops live in
the city. Several lodge In the factories,
and others have their residence in the
neighborhood. Very few among them go
outside the fortifications, for it Is impor
tant that they should not shorten their
moments of leisure by uselessly prolong
ing the four daily Journeys. As for the
workmen, the center of St. Charles quick
ly became too dear for them, so they In
habit what may be called the suburbs of
a suburb.
The chief characteristic, therefore, of
this outlying center Is a population of na
tive retail shopkeepers and of modest
clerks; another of workmen, rather su
perior In number, and no wealthy people,
although the whole of St. Charles belongs
to big capitalists.
The effect of this repartition of the in
habitants may be divinedâ the workpeople
and the minor citizens perpetually In con
flict over all purely local questions, the
prepotent influence in all political affairs
there, as everywhere elae. being exercised
by the moneyed classâ that is to say, by
people who do not live In the place.
Their Influence, It must be admitted, la
rarely called Into play. It Is felt from
time to time, a sort of providential
eclipse. Now and again some big manu
facturer finds It necessary to make a po
litical stronghold for himself In St.
Charles. But the politics of the place and
the emoluments they represent belong, as
a general rule, to the genuine Inhabitants,
native or Immigrant. Thus the eternal
division of the French provinces Into two
partiesâ the governing power and the op
positionâls naturally found there. As
there is no aristocracy In St. Charles, the
native shopkeepers and a few annuitants
represent the stubborn conservative, or. If
you prefer, reactionary party, which In
creases gradually through the addition to
It of the pensioned clerks. When a man
has worked in a provincial town for twen
ty or thirty years and has become that
pitiable creatureâ a pensionerâ he neither
feels the desire nor has the means to
leave his county center and to go to lire
In Paris. Thus it Is with the majority of
the retired employes at St. Charles, a true
provincial town. They rent a house with
a little garden, preferably near the forti
fications; take up their residence there
with- their family and continue as annuit
ants their former life, aggravated by
weariness. Their sole diversion Is to stroll
along the banks of the Seine, to watch
the soldiers drill, to go to the Grenello
Theatre and to visit a few fairs, among
which about every eleven years Is a gi
gantic oneâ the exposition.
Being annuitants, they are conservative,
like all the retired population of France,
through a terror Inspired by the vague
peril of spoliation. Their children, born
In St. Charles, are officials to their very
marrow, like most children of. pension
ers: but the boundaries of St. Charles
limit the entire field of their ambition.
They aspire to a post In the Town Hall,
to become teachers or assistants In the
municipal schools of the district or offi
cials In the hospitals. The most daring
covet a place in the workshops. When
a youth manifests any aptitude for math
ematics he is sent to the Ecole Centrale.
When his military service leaves him freo
he frequently returns to his native place
and obtains a situation In the factories
at Roussln. Duramberty, Verdier or of
some competitor of these manufacturing
princes. Men In frock coats. Jackets or
cutaways, they become the founders of
families of conservatives in their turn,
forever tormented by the fear of revolu
tion. For they see the phantom of so
cialism In the form of oil-stained caps, of
faces grimy with coal dust, of starved,
bareheaded females, suckling, pallid
faced babes, eaten away with scrofula.
passing before them every day at the
hour when the factory bell 3 ring, like a
warning tocsin. The old annuitants and
pensioners, crouching behind the windows
of their little houses, watch this army of
misery, hunger, hard work and drink
march past and call to their wives:
"Look at the anarchists ?'
But they have nothing to fear. The
worklngmen's party would be the most
powerful In St. Charles, as In all Indus
trial centers, were It not unintelligent,
narrow minded and led astray. It Is all
this. After having been united, from
about ISSO to ISSS. under the guidance of
an ambitious leader, the party was dis
organized by his death. There was no
one to take his place as chief, and tho
party split In two. An adroit campaign
conducted by the reactionariesâ 1. c the
monarchists and imperialistsâ and ' tha
clericals envenomed these divisions and
turned them to account- The worklne
men's party made an alliance with the to
actionaries overthrew the Municipal
Council and replaced It with one made up
of reactionaries and of so-called extreme
eoclallsts. This strange eomblnaiton Â£!
lsted for three years, was defeated In lta
turn by the allied socialists n.nd radical*.

THE WoROS 3HE UTTERED UPON THAT 'OCCASION REMAINED ENGRAVED list THE-
- â¢â¢ MEMORY OF mWHo HEfIRD.HER.-v-â -.â¢â¢â¢-.->-.-Quignonnet retained the hairy hand held
out to him by the Abbe.
"Wait a minute. What are you talking
about? The Sisters are going to enlarge
the Convent of the Sacred Blood? They
said nothing to me about It. Yet they
cannot be thinking of conducting the ne
gotiations themselves?"
"I don't think so," said Mlnot, walking
away slowly toward the building.
"Have they got^a broker?" asked, the
Deputy Mayor. . ' '
"No, they simply asked my advice. Good
day."
Quignonnet took the Abbe by the arm
and compelled him to stop.
"I hope you're hot going to propose any
other intermediary to them?"
"I shall not propose any one. It's not
my business. Remember this, my dear
fellow, nothing Is more dangerous than to
give advice to those good Sisters."
"Oh, come. Abbe," said the Deputy
Mayor; "you're not speaking seriously. I
rely upon you, just as you may rely upon
me to look after your schools; you know
that very Â¦well!"
. The face of Abbe Minot assumed an ex
pression that was both cunning and stu
pid, the expression of a farmer about to
-strike a bargain.
"Oh!" he said, "the Sisters may not
need any one. All I kr.ov.- is that the un
dertaking Is a big one. It will cost 130,
000 francs at the very least."
"A hundred and fifty?" repeated Quig
nonnet. lisping with emotion. "Get the
affair for me, my dear Jean Francois. I
guarantee that the interests of your
nuns will.be in good hands, and I will not
forget your religious shanties. What I
said to you v. few minutes ago was only
In joke. You know that I am always ready
to help you. Is it a bargain?"
He ra!sed his voice a' little, carried
away by his desire to secure the consent
of the priest. Minot. without replying,
looked toward the door of the Deputy
Mayor's office, which they were approach-
Ing.' .Quignonnet raised h:s eyes in turn,
and was taken aback for a moment when
he saw a man standing before his stable
stooping over his papers a.nd fingering
them. It was Jude Duramberty, with
his hat on his head and a cane in one of
his gloved hands. At the sound of the
footsteps of Quignonnet and Minot on the
two steps leading up to the door he
turned. His ruddy ; visage, with inky
black mustache and imperial, although
the thick, bushy hair was slightly gray,
appeared in the full light of the after
noon sun. His dark eyes examined the
pair as they drew near, and he made a
step toward them.
"Good day, Quignonnet. Good day.
Abbe."
He took off his silk hat and laid It on
the desk. The Abbe and the Deputy
Mayor bowed with a friendly-air.
"Excuse me, Quignonnet, for having en
tered. Bonnault told me you were here."
"Quite so, M. Duramberty; he was quite
right. You are at home here. We went
to take a breath of fresh air in the gar
den. To what do I owe the honor of a
visit?"
"I will tell you. Have you a moment
to spare?"
"Certainly; as many as you like, M.
Jude. Won't you take a seat?"
"I will leave you," said- the Abbe Minot,
walking toward the door.
"You are not in the way. Abbe: on the
contrary, you may be able to give us some
useful information."
Duramberty sat do^-n upon the sofa, the
Abbe on a chair, while Quignonnet took
his place before the desk. There were a
few moments of silence, during which the
manufacturer, with frowning brow, ap
peared to be reflecting about what he was
going to say. His two friends waited re
spectfully for him to begin.
"I received a visit this morning from
Fredal and Mme. Ribaut. They are both
rather dissatisfied and anxious."
"About what?" asked Quignonnet.
"It appears that the outlook for the
forthcoming school year Is not very prom
ising. Fredal has lost only three pupils,
but* Mme. Ribaut has not a single new
one, and she loses eleven. â¢ Do you know
where they are Â«lt going?"
"To 'the religious schools, naturally,"
said the Deputy Mayor, glancing at the
Abbe. â¢ â¢
"I'm afraid not," sighed the Abbe; "our
reopenlngs are not so very brilliant as all
that!"
"All the pupils who are leaving Mme.
Ribaut are going to the Pirnitz-Heurteau
school. It is a sort of mania In the neigh
borhood. The directresses put all sorts of
obstacles in the way of receiving now
pupils; refuse this one and that. But in
pplte of all, applications still flow in. The
bchool Is popular."
"Heaven only knows why!" cried the
Abbe. "The programme they follow is
lifte nothing In this world. There Is no
regular course, ami not a single one of
their pupils has come forward for a di
ploma."
"No, there are no examinations," said
Quigncnnet, assentingly; "It Is against
their principles. I understand very easily
why 'the pupils prefer It, but I cannot
comprehend the parents."
"Oh, they are attracted by the novelty:
They aie tickled with the ld-^a that th-j
children go shopping three by three, wear
ing a black cashmere dress and a red
sash; that they run about in the country
with a green box slung over their shoul
der and caXch butterflies. At any rate,
I suppose so!" said Minot grumblingly.
"Did Fredal and Mme. Ribaut come to
you because you are a member of th*
committee upon instruction?" the Deputy
Mayor asked M. Duramberty.
"Fredal did." replied Duramberty. "As
for Mme. Ribaut, she purposes Bending a
report to the council upon the situation
she is in as the result of this new com
petition: and, believing me to be a patron
of the little 'Arts,' she came to apologize
in advance and to ask if I should oppose
her."
Qulpnonnet said nothing, but Mlnot,
atter a moment, rtked:
"You do take an interest in them, don't
you? "
He had again put on the good-natured,
stupid air that he always adopted to ask
awkward questions.
"I?" replied Duramberty. "Not morÂ»
than I do in any other undertaking In this
quarter. Besides, those women do not de
serve any friendly Interest. They are a
little too self-confident." '*'.'Â¦-,
"The inspector even complains about It."
said Quignonnet, emboldened by the man
ufacturer's tone.
"As far as I am concerned," said the
Abbe, shaking out his broadhemmed
handkerchief, "I say they are blockheads.
If they had not Sainte-Purade's millions
behind them their school wouldn't lust
. very long."
â¢ He blew his nose noisily. Duramberty
smiled.
"Millions? Have you seen the millions
that belong to Mile, de Sainte-Parade?*
"Oh, I can assure you, sir. Sainte-Pa
rade has plenty of money. I know her
when she attended St. Francois Xavier's
Church. I was even her confessor. At
â¢ that time she was a very good woman;
she hadn't yet fallen Into the hanJj cf
that Pirnitz gang. But she is certainly
richâ ve.-y rÂ»ch."
"She speculates," said Duramberty.
"She has doubled her fortune with cop
per stocks, which Michel told her to buy."
"Yes, Michel has advised her very
well," said Duramberty, "but she has ac
quired a taste for s-peculation! The ex
penses of the school are enormous. At
the next reopeninij they will have sixty
pupils. 1 got this information from the
only one of thuse women who Is at all
accessible."
"Mile. Pirnitz?"
"Xo, Mile. Heurteau, a former public
school teacher. She admits that each
pupil costs s<X!f. a year. Mile, do Sainte-
Parade is rich enough to look afttr the
school as it i.s at present, but not if it Is
enlarged to the proportions she dreams
of. She has speculated oiu.-e, and she will
speculate again and the day. that Michel
goes under" ,
Jude Duramberty did not finish his
phrase. He chewed the stump of his
cigar for a little while. Minot and Quig
nonnet did not speak, for they were in
terested to hear tho most influential man
of the district unbosoming himself upon
a subject which was usually treated witn
reserve in their discussions.
"These women are very unsympathe
tic," went on the manufacturer. "I have
helped them as much as 1 could. But for
me they could never have built their
school. I founded a scholarship and of
fered them my overseers to give a course
of les3ons free. They refused my offer,
under the* pretext that the rules of the
school excluded men from the educational
course. It is madness! Feminism! What
do people mean by feminism? I admit
that women have a right and a desire to
earn their bread honestly, but they have
no business to pose immediately as ene
mies of society."
"They are simply a lot of blockheads."
said the Abbe, who seemed to be quite
satisfied with this epithet.
"They are beginning to antagonize, by
their attitude, ail who at firiÂ« were favor
able to them." said yuignonnet. "The
Abbe, for exampU. does not seem to have
a very warm affection for them."
"They are a lot of blockheads. M. Jude."
repeated Mlnot. "Besides, is It decent for
a free schocl to be without a chaplain?
After all. I can understond governmental
schools being VitJiout one. They are
watched by the Chamber, and the Gov
.ernment cannot do just Â«s it would like â
althoughâ well, no matter. â¢ â¢ â¢ But,
think of women who pretend to be Chris
lions, and who will not allow a minister
of religion to enter their door! I am told
they are going to admit Protestants and
Jewesses: Woulii you like to know what
Is my opinion of feminists?"
"They are crazy," said Quignonnet.
"Just imagine a Sainte-Parade intrusting
her interests to a man like Michel!"
"They are anarchists." continued Minot.
"and more dangerous than anarchists
with bombs, for tnpy are bring up pupils
who will destroy something more Import
ant than a house on a boulevard. They
will overthrow marriage, the family, so
ciety. It is a school of rank anarchy!
You will see! It's your dMty. you who
govern the district, either to shut up
that building or to exercise your author
ity over it."
"Bravo, Abb**!" cried Quignonnet.
But Jude Duramberty shook his head:â
"It's easier to talk of shutting up or
contrplling a school than it is to do It.
In the first place, we have no power to
do either legally, and even it we succeed
ed in the roundabout way, we should
have all the supporters of the school, the
parents of the pupils, against us."
"The pupils are almost all orphans."
"Not all. There were many In the first
batch. I know; but those who enter next
year have fathers and mothers."
"Well, what are we to do?" asked Quig
nonnet. "We cannot allow the municipal
schools to be depopulated for the benefit
of those spendthrifts."
"I have some reason to believe that
financial embarrassment will trouble them,
very soon," replied Duramberty. "We
might seek some information on this
point. Try to find out, Quignonnet, what
stock Michel is speculating In now! I am
told that he has risked a lot of capital In
an ' American wheat trust. That looks IlkÂ©
madness to me!"
"I will find out."
"Then we must make a campaign to de
fend our schools. Have you a newspaper
at your disposition. Abbe?"
"Yes, I have the Semaine de St. Charles.
It's not a bad little sheet. We could pub
lish an article or two in it that would ba
reproduced by the Important dailies."
"Articles about our schools?"
"Xo. Preferably about theirs. I should
have* begun In the Semaine long ago ha<l
It not been that I did not wish to di.^pleasa
M. Ju<le. But you may rely upon me! And
in addition to the articles we can talk."
"Talk?"
; "Certainly: say amonsr friends what wo
think about the school anil Its tendencies.
I know some little annuitants at St.
Charles' who are not very anxious to sea
a hotbed of anarchy thriving In this dis
trict."
"Not only of anarchy, but of co?mÂ°polt
tanism." added Quignonnet. "Those wom
en came from every part of the globe.
There is a Hungarian, an Irish woman
and an English woman. They belong to>
every nationality."
"You are right." cried tho Abb**; "surh,
a school is both anti-natriotic and anti
social. Ah.' there I have a title for my ar
ticle in the Somnint*." he added, spe-akin?
tn himself. " "An Anti-Patriotic spd Anti
social School. A So-called Feminist l*n
dertakincr.' Ah! feminism! I'll talk about
It to the children nt the catechism on per
severance before their mothers. I'll scara
the life out of them!"
Duramberty and Quignonnet began to
laugh.
"All the same," continued the Abh<Â». ris
ing and brushing his three-cornered hat
with his sleeve, "there are raar.y thine?*
that we might borrow from the pro
gramme of thost? lunatics. The day that
religion animates their ideas you will sea
a magnificent school! That's what I sny
to the good Sisters; they are so horrihly
hliiebotind! By the way. it's time I went!
They have been waiting for me at th-->
Sacred Blood for three-fjarter3 of an>
hour!"
He took leave of them.
"Good day. Minot," said Duramberty.
Quignonnet went with tho Abbe as far
as the door and whispered:
"It's a bargain, isn't it? I rely upon
you."
The Deputy Mayor and Durnmberty
talked for a little while longer about cur
rent municipal affairs. When tho regia
' ters had been closed and everything put
In orderQuignonnet walked with tha
manufacturer as far as his workshops.
"Do you know Michel, Quignonnet?"
asked Duramberty.
"We have been brought together two or
three times in business affairs. He la
very intelligent, but he must have some
vices, for he makes plenty of money and
yet becomes no richer. His colleague is .<.
notary in Levallols who enjoys a rather
shady reputation. The rumftr got about
last year that the notary had absconded.
It wasn't true, but his clients who bad
deposited money with him had a frightful
shock."
"I had a talk with him," said Duram
berty, "the first time that I saw Mile. d>>
Sainte-Parade, when he drew up the draft
of the contract for the transfer of my
land. He seemed to me rather smart.
though timid."
"Yes-, the timidity of somo one who
dreads an allusion to his past:"
"Well. I don't know. I had an Inquiry
made at that t!m<> as to the way he had
protected Sainte-Parade'a Interests. Therti
wasn't a single irregularity to be discov

miracle! But if he were to advise her
now to throw her mon^y into the Seine ti>
feÂ«Â»d tho fishes she wouid do it."
"That's just what I have heard. He ha 3
been very honest with her. It's inex
plicable!" _
The two men turned into the Rue dcs
Vergers. A few steps more and they were
at the door of the workshop. Just as they
arrived thenÂ» two little "Arts" came out
of the neighboring school.
"They are very pretty!" murmurcl
Quignonnet.
"Yes. Thf-y will make fierce competi
tors for thfÂ» men when they become de
signers glazers, printers, and so on!'
"It la already difficult for a man to earn

fully. "Feminism is criminal. It ?imp!V
doubles th^ number of candidates without
doubling the number of situations. It is
a multiplication of poverty."
"Bah:" retorted tjuignonnet; I don t
believe In the rivalry between men ana
women. Women will always be tndlfTer

that at the factory, M. Jude. A woman tn

three-quarters the amount of work of a

the worse for the women. Th^ day they
begin to interfere with men In their work;

"You are right." repli.-tl Duramberty.
"The first tools with which women who>
pose as rivals and adversaries of men
ought to be provided are muscles aa

They shook hands and separated.
Quignonnet had only gone a few stcpa in

M- Duraxnberty, who had never attempt
ed to be anything other than a Municipal
Councillor, was considered to belong to
the Anquetln party, but his great fortune
and his authoritative manner earned for
him the sympathies of the church. He had
gtxen large sums of money to the religious
schools upon several occasions. It must
bo admitted that he had redeemed him
Â¦d& so to e"peak, by presenting a larger
amount to the municipal schools each
time. Thanks to these liberalities, the
church pardoned him for his Indiffer

being a member cf the Grand Sphinx

fact, he never set foot any more than he
ever attended mass.

the arrival of the Abbe Minot. the first
curate of the parish. This priest <Je
t-<-rves to be described In detail.
Jean Francois Mario Minot, the son of
ruarket gardeners In the environs of
Louveciennes, was born In 1S62. His
mother suffered from cancer, and being
rolipiously inclined, owing to the impos
sibility of curing it, had always intended
him for the priesthood. He accomplished
the several stages of the ecclesiastical
profession faithfully and uneventfully;
| left the little seminary at Orleans to study
::: the big seminary at Versailles; 6erved
the church in the neighborhood of Paris,
ur.d finally became the third-rate curate
at St. Francois Xavier's. In the seventh
trrondissement of the capital. Totally
unknown until that moment, he coon made
himself a power in the aristocratic circles
of his new parish, though there was noth
ing aristocratic about his manner. He af
fected a simplicity of dresa that was in
Ftrlking contrast with the care devoted to
this detail by several of his colleagues.
His manner was polite, without being ser
vile. His strong features, rudely carved,
like a. sort of Japanese war mask, upon
which the skin was always red from the
Irritation of the razor, so harsh was his
growth cf beard; his black, tangled hair,
his great, clumsy hands and big feet be
trayed his peasant origin, of which, in
fact, he boasted. He preached the Lenten
pennons in 1K4 without making any sen
sation. Yet, In spite cf this absence of
attractive appearance and brilliant tal
ents, he exercised over his parishioners,
his colleagues, and even over several of his
eupericrs. the authority always felt by the
feeble and undecided when In the presence
cf anapparently firm will of determination
end lucidity of thought united to an Irre
proachable life. People felt that Jean
Francois Minct was absolutely disinter
ested and devoid of ambition! but ready
to do anything, to suffer anything, for
the greater prosperity of the church.
This temperament, frequent enough In
some of the religious orders. Is much less
common among the members of the secu
laxtflergy. particularly in Paris. It Is not
popular there. Minot's indefatigable act
ivity seemed a perpetual reproach to many
cf his colleagues for their idleness. As this
activity spent itself outside his religious
duties and for the furtherance of the ma
terial Interests bf his church it offered
en easy mark for criticism. In addition,
belr.g very Independent In character. Ml-
not r.erer sought advice about tho steps
he might think necessary to take. He was
teen aX the Department of Religious Wor
fchip. at the City Hall, at the various. Gov
ernmental ministries, at the bankers', a
tireless beggar knocking at every door,
eeeking help from every purse, obtaining
astonishing results at the price of a few
rebuffs, which he disdained. It was ha
who founded near St. Francis Xavier's
t hospital for domestic 6cr\-ants, provid
ing the necessary capital and carrying on
the undertaking with an extraordinary
talcr.t for management. The accusation
tecrctly made against him, at first in ec
clesiastical circles, of being an intriguer.
finally became a rumor so persistent and
t>0 unmistakable that the Archbishop was
moved to act upon it. The Abbe Minot
was transferred without being consulted,
and promoted to the post of lirst curate of
the parish chuch of St. Charles. In thus
exiling him to a labonng district his short
cighted superiors aspired to remove from
his path all material for the utilization of
an activity that alarmed them. Jc.anFran
cois accepted his new post without mur
muring: and began to study the place and

A few days sufficed for him to make
mffelf familiar with the political condi- â¢
ana obtaining In the parish. A homo
Â¦n'.ous .and' relentlessly socialistic mu
cipality had been returned at the last
ectlon, a municipality that refused to

inot could have claimed with justice :
at he had won the victory, but he was
ee from vanity and cared nothing for :
ory. He worked for the sake of worlt
p. intrigued for the sake o! intriguing, i
ith the disinterested infallibility of in- :
inct. The various groups that he had !
.^united so cleverly were almost unaware ;
of his influence. They believed him to be i
merely the Instrument wielded by power- '.
ful hands. As a matter of fact he acted <
entirely upon his own initiative. M. de t
Lesparre and the Alglons, the leaders of
the clerical party, quickly fell Into his
hands. As for the Vicar, the Abbe Du
bcurdicr, a venerable priest of C 5, en
Â¦ feeb!e<i by a chronic malady of the larynx,
Â¦ a. man of seraphic piety and of tireless
: charity, he thought himself lucky to find
fuch an intelligent, upright and active
coadjutor.
The rout of the socialist party pure and
simple at St. Charles was. complete at the
moment when the events occurred that
are about to be related. It had no lead
trs. it had not even a name. The clever
and honest administration of the munici
pal funds was above criticism. Anquetin
and Duramberty enjoyed the sympathy of
all. The reactionary party, satisfied with
having six of their members in the Muni
cipal Council and with having excluded
from It the enemies who had dominated
them so long, proclaimed the perfect mor
ality of the compact. The Republicans
"What does it matter if there be
six clericals in the Council, since they do
everything that we want and the majority
is in cur hands.? We shall not let them
confiscate us." ' As for the voice of the
opposition, dispersed and leaderless, it
could not make itself henrd.
In the course of the year ISP7 a fairly
large vacant plat of land belonging to M.
Jude Durambcrty and contiguous to his
factories was acquired by a certain Mile,
de Sainte-Parade for the purpose of erect
in? there a professional school for girls.
Mile, cie Sainte-Parade, a woman of good
family, originally from the Gers, was
about Zo years of age. Paralyzed in the
legs, she was carried about in an arm
chair whenever t<he wis-licd to go any
where. She was rich. In addition to tho
house in the Rue de Grenelle. In Paris,
that she inhabited alone with her ser
vant? and a nun who nursed her, she pos
sessed property in tho environs of Con
dom as well as considerable capital. The
Abbe Minot. who had been her religious
director when he was attached to the
Church of St. Francois Xavier, assured
people that she had greatly added to her
fortune by speculating on the Bourse un
der the guidance and advice of a broker
named Michel, a man devoted to the
clergy.
Ml!e. de Sainte-Parade's scholastic un
dertaking aroused much curiosity. It was
one of the first attempts at feminism
that had appeared in the midst of the
numerous schools in St. Charles. Mile.
de SaJnte-Parade was assisted by a gen
eral staff of ladles who negotiated lor the
acquirement of the ground and directed
the work of building and organizing the
school, without any masculine help. This
general staff was net composed solely of
ridiculous, old and ugly women, a re
proach so often addressed to feminist
groups. The foundress was assisted by
several fairly attractive auxiliariesâ Mile.
Heurteau, a former public schoolteacher;
the two "little Suriers." Loa and Frede
rique, two girls of 13 and 2*, respectively,
who had both been employed in Duram
berty's workshops formerly and had left
suddenly, according to some because they
had refused to bow to M. Duramberty's
demands. The two young girls were re
markably beautiful, Frederique, the elder,
being a brunette with a pale complexion,
dark eyes and clearly cut features, and
Lea. the younger, more delicate and senti
mental in appearance, prettier in the
meaning ordinarily attached to the word,
with blue eyes and nut brown hair the
rich color of pale bronze. Among the
"pretty ones" were also Included Mile.
Duyvecke Hespcl, a stout Fleming, with
milk white flesh and flaxen hair, a former
pupil at the Normal School at Sevres;
Ge.rmaine Soubize, a certificated nurse, a
little red haired prirl whose alluringly ugly
freckled face and animated bearing whet
ted men's licentious appetites.
Some of the others, less attractive to the
sight, were christened without any cere
mony "the monsters." Mile, de Sainte-
Parade, with her immense head and
shriveled, deformed .body, her shrill voice
and Fkin like wrinkled parchment, was
classed among the monsters. Anothermon
rter was Daisy Craggs, an Irish woman of
about 40 years of age with a kindly, rosy
cheeked face, the face of an old baby,
crowned with locks of hair of an unde
cided fihade. lying midway between gray
and hemp color. Three assistants, who
were seen walking about with the pupils,
were equally lacking in either beauty or
grace. And, finally, one of the feminine
personages who most interested the town
was not classed either among the "pretty
ones" or among "the monsters."
She was a little woman, apparently an
Invalid, with thin black hair. Her face,
pale as a wafer, haggard, and, so to
j?peak, transparent, was lit up by the blu
ish tyght of her eyes, by a regard of ex
traordinary power and magnetism. With
out being deformed, she had the figure
and bearing of what the common people
characterized by the picturesque term, "a
bad attempt at a hunchback." Her name
had' a foreign ringâ Romaine Pirnitz.
Rightly or wrongly, the occult influence
that guided the enterprise was attributed
to her, although she bore no official title.
Those who met her once' never forgot her.
Her eyes seemed to emit the sympathy in
spiring flame that is the secret power of
seducers of souls, of apostles. Her elo
quence had been a proverb in St. Charles
from the day of the school's Inauguration,
when she made a speech that contained
the programme of the new education. The
words she uttered upon that occasion re
mained engraved In the memory of all
who heard her. Without obscurity, with
out exaggeration, she explained to the
public assembled In the big hall of the
buildingâ a mixed public of novelty seek
ers, journalists, politicians and society
peopleâ that they were not going merely
to teach the daughters of the poor to
spell, to teach them a' little arithmetic,
how to sew, ornamental drawing and the
rudiments of the industrial arts. They
were also going to lay the bases for the
complete education of women by woman,
to create a seminary for young girls who
should be veritably moral and capable of
providing for their own needs without be
ing obliged to rely upon men at a period
Â¦when in Franco, as in America and Eng
land, celibacy Is a cruel social necessity
for many of them.
" All these Ideas were expressed with such
clearness and facility and with such con
vincing warmth that they had not ap
peared at all subversive. On the con
trary, they resembled the reasonable ex-*
presslon of average common-sense. Hum
ble and uninfluential though it pleased
her to appear, Romaine Pirnitz remained
in the minds of her listeners as the ln
eiiircr and soul of the School of Arts for
Women.
The official management was In the
hands of Mile. Heurteau, assisted by
Frederique Surier. As for Mile de Sainte-
Parade, M. Duramberty, who had met
her to discuss with her the transfer of the
plat cf land, de-clarcdthat she was an old
lunatic ruled in turn by priests, stock
holders and the Utopists of feminism.
This transfer had been made under
somewhat rare conditions. M. Duram
berty, wishing, co he said, to help a gen
erous enterprise, had not asked for any
ready money. The school would have no
rent to pay for twenty years. If It should
exist on the same spot at the end of that
period the foundresses could buy the
Â¦ground at a price to be fixed according to
the value of the surrounding property,
without paying anything for thetr twenty
years' tenancy. If. on the contrary, the
enterprise should fall for any reason, or
if the foundresses should leave it, M.
Duramberty was to recover his property
and the buildings were to pass Into his
possession without any compensation from
him being due. In order that the purchase
of the land in twenty years might be at
least partially guaranteed, the manage
ment of tho school deposited 300,000 francs
In the Bank of France as security, though
the Echool drew the entire amount of the
Interest upon this sum.
The School of Arts for Women had the
good fortune to be well received, not only
in the Buburb,- but also in the whole of
Paris. The Illustrated papers published
photograph* of the buildings and the por
traits of Mile, de Sainte-Parade and Mile.
Heurteau. Leader writers strung togeth
er commonplaces upon the feminist ques
tion and revealed by their very articles
: that they were totally Ignorant of the
subject. Then Paris began to think of
something else, to talk and write about
other things, and the School of Arts for
, Women aroused no further Interest ex
Â¦ cept in the corner of the suburb where it
was built. Its opening period was en
couraging. The shopkeepers of the quar
ter smiled amiably upon their new cus
tomers. Every Sunday about thirty
pupils, aged from 10 to 16, and accompan
ied by one of the lady professors, gravely
attended mass at the parish church. The
Abbe Minot was on good terms with the
directresses of the school. It was said
at the town hall that M. Durambarty
had given his land and had founded a
scholarship in the establishment. His in
terest in it was said to be due principally
to Mile. Frederique Surier, whom he had
pursued with his attentionsâwhether suc
cessfully or not public opinion was di
vided. Naturally, the school, which was
a formidable rival, was not regarded with
a friendly eye by the official school party,
the primary teachers and the directors of
industrial Instruction. However, as it
was recognized by tho State â for the in
auguration ceremony had been presided
over by a delegate from the Ministry of
Public Instructionâ no one dared display
any open hostility. The Compact of St.
Charles had proclaimed an armistice be
tween state r.ml unofficial education. Be
isides, the directress cf the school, Mile.
Heurteau, was a. university graduate pro
vided . with all the necessary diplomas.
What more could be asked?
After the brilliant inauguration the fem
inist work appeared to have Undertaken
the task of making people forget its ex
istence. There was not much, traitic in the
Rue dcs Verger?, in which was the prin
cipal gate of the anterior courtyard. When
this gAte opened the rare passers-by could
see hojv well kept were the buildings, how
clean were the courtyards and 'what or
der reigned everywhere. In the evening
the windows, brilliantly lighted with elec
trie light, even eclipsed those of the Dur
amberty workshop^ The little pupils,
neatly dressed in black, with red cash
mere rashes, were met in the neighbor
hood and always without governesse'ssave
when -they were in great number. They
were only llttlo Parisian daughters of the
people carefully recruited. But childhood
is so malleable and so impressionable to
new ideas that the bearing of the little
"Arts," a* the public called them, soon
became or.p cf distinction. .They displayed
an amusing air of intelligence, decision
and independence. 'Three of them did the
marketing every morning, at first accom
panied by a teacher, but later alone. Very
soon the.y did all the ordinary shopping
of the school. Classical afternoon per
formances having been arranged at the
theater of Grenelle. a score of the little
"Arts' attended them on Sundays and
Thursdays, so digniiied, attentive and with
such a natural grace that even the sar
castic sallies of the gallery gods were
spared them. When spring reanimated
life in the country groups of little "Arts"
joyously escaped 'from the school in the
care of a mistress and rambled about the
suburbs with entomologists' boxes slung
over their shoulders. At the end of every
term the notabilities of the town were in
vited to attend a dramatic and musical
evening given in a big hall.
The programme was not extraordinary,
but merely to enter the school was suffi
cient to prove that a very radical change
of educational method was followed. Its
effects were manifest In the bearing of
the pupils, left to themselves free from
supervision, and who looked their mis
tresses and the public frankly In the face
and recited distinctly and without embar
rassment or timidity. It was admitted
that the little "Arts" were amusing and
pretty, and that they were very wide
awake. tii'Yr
This complete agreement between the
school and the social forces of the town
still existed at the end of the first schol
tlc year. An experienced philosopher
would have been surprised that It lasted
fo long. It was Impossible that the.es
sence of the work undertaken by Romaine
Pirnitz and her collaboratrcsses could be
assimilated in the existing spirit of a
Paris faubourg. In the first place the
Parisian population is not to be easily
persuaded that a union of women from
which men are excluded can organize and
carry out a serious and durable enterprise.
Woman in Paris is an article of luxury,
of debauch, or simply of the household.
Any effort to open jjp other functions for
her is looked upon as revolutionary or
ridiculous. The school In the Rue dcs
Vergers escaped banter by a miracle when
it was founded, but it was closely watched
hy the philistine mind, irritated by this
feminine rebellion, and also by the ironical
multitude to whom feminism is a variety
of masquerade.
As for the social forces, properly speak
ing â that is, the church, the municipal
ity and. the official schools, the first two,
at any rate, could have assuredly lived
upon peaceful terms with Pirnltz's work
on the condition, however, that they could
use it and that they cpuld dominate It.
The Compact of St. Charles was not a
programme of tolerance; It was an offen
sive alliance and a menace to all those
who did not participate in It. A free
school that did not subscribe to the com
pact was at once suspicious to the cleri
cals and to the municipality, for being
independent it could inaugurate or rein
force the opposition any day. As for the
official school party, which accepted, the
conditions of the compact and the equality
of treatment accorded to religious estab
lishments with much Impatience, It was
soon Irritated by a competition that was
not even under the safeguard of the mu
nicipality.
The Instincts of the crowd and- political
interests were, therefore, entering into a
coalition against the expansion of the
work. Undertakings can resist and tri
umph over such coalitions. The founda
tion of the Institut Pasteur, so opposed
and finally victorious, is a proof of this.
But they have to be supported by power
ful adherents and above all by Inexhaus
tible financial resources. The feminist ,
party, although so solid In other coun
tries, has no appreciable strength in Paris
as yet. # The financial question, therefore,
was one of life and death for tho School
of Arts for Women.
CHAPITER 11.
One afternoon in June, toward the end
of the scholastic year of 1838, the Deputy
Mayor of St. Charles, Quignonnet, was
seated before the massive mahogany desk
of his office In the town hall verifying the
accounts for some repairs that had re
cently been executed at the municipal fire
engine station, when an unllveried office
boy half opened the door.
Quignonnet, who was just finishing add
ing up a column qf figures, made a sign
.with his hand for him to wait. When he
had written the total he raised his headâ
a little, lean, sandy head, crowned with
sparse hair, with a bushy mustache cut
level with the line of the lips. He spoke
with a little lisp, as though the words
found their way with difficulty out of hi 3
narrow mouth. In which the protruding
teeth were all awry.
"What is the matter, Bonnault?"
"The Abbe Mlnot wishes to speak to
you, sir."
"Very good: show him in."
Without closing the door the boy with
drew and returned In a few moments fol
lowed by the priest.
Jean Francois Mlnot advanced familiar
ly, his battered, -weather-beaten three
cornered hat under Hi* arm, his short cas
sock disclosing his stoutly soled shoes,
with their steel buckles. Pearls of per
spiration were standing upon his farmer's
face, above the skin reddened by the cor
rosive action of the razor. He held out
his large hand to Quignonnet. who gave
h!m two fingers with precaution, one of
tho Abbe's amusements being to squeeze
in his huge paw the stockbroker's thin
"Good-day! Gravedlgger!"
Minot appreciated a joke and often made
one. Between Quignonnet and the Abbe a
Joke consisted above all in exchanging in
sulting epithets aimed at their respective
callings. Â«â¢>'Â¦'â¢
"How hot it Is," sighed the priest, alt- :
tin*? down, without waiting to be asked,
and wiping his forehead with a big white
handkerchief, of which the broad hem
and the mark In red cotton could be seen
a long distance away. The atmosphere of
the room, really stifling In such canicular
temperature, was heavy with the human
odor peculiar to red-haired people. It was
almost unbreathable, although a large
glazed door leading Into the garden was
wide open. But the garden Itself was ab
solutely without shade except for a lit
tle arbor at the end.
Â¦ The Abbe passed his finger between his
neck and bands In order to get a little air.
"You are only a packet of bones and
tanned hide," he continued, "and you are
as comfortable here as a dried codlish,
but I perspire abnormally. 1 am so fat!
bo fat!"
"You people at the parsonage eat too
much," replied Quignonnet, laying down
his pen. "If you had only the salary of a
Deputy Mayor to live upon you wouldn't
get so fat. What brings you here?"
Mniot looked at him without sneaking.
All the muscles of hia lips, of his eyes,
of his forehead united in a smilo that he
did his utmost to render coaxing.
"I should like"â he began, and then
"You know very well."
"Jf you want some more money for your
filthy; religious shanties," the Deputy
Mayor said, roughly, "you may as well
shake the dust of this place off your feet
on the other side of the door straight
away. There baa been nothing but your
name in the budget for about a year.
What a gulf, great heaven! Don't you Re
alize that you will end by provoking 1 a
.serious attack upon us? Duvert is in the
confidence of' Fredal, the public school
teacher, and of Mme. Ribaut, the direct
ress of the professional school for girls,
and he tells me they are beginning to
complain about us on the quiet."
"Duvert?" replied the Abbe calmly.
"Duvert doesn't care a rap for Fredal,
Ribaut or any of us. lie has two daugh
ters who go to school to the Sisters of
the Sacred Blood and a son who Is study
ing with the fathers In Vaugirard. He
knows what your schools are worth, you
old 6 per cent!"
"That may be. Duvert brings up his
children according to his own ideas, but
from refusing to give another sou to your
schools this year. You may take my
word for It." "\1
Mlnot took a pastille put of the pocket
of his cassock and began to suck it nois
ily. QuignonnQt watched him, grinning.
"Well, and how are we going to provide
our prizes?" asked the Abbe. "We have
two girls' schools, one for boys, a hospital
for sick children and a nursery, all of
v.hlch require something to make the end
of the year a little more cheerful. What
are we going to do it with? Eh?"
He had lost all his jovial manner and
genuine anxiety darkened his peasant's
face.
"Ah! Blessed Virgin:" he continued,
thumping the black of the seat upon
which he was sitting with his fist.
"You have already received more than
two thousand francs for unforeseen ex
penses," returned" the deputy, "under the
pretext tbat they were needed for the dis
tribution of prizes. Have they already
been swallowea up? If they have, It Is
not astonishing that you're bo fat!"
"Two thousand francs!" grumbled the
Abbe, they have already goneâ gone
very far! What am I to do for my new
nursery in the Rue Delormel? Why.
there are a hundred mouths there that
seem to eat money, although there Isn't
a tooth in one ofjthem! And to think that
you are so miserly with us because that
idiot of a Duvert has repeated a lot of
gossip to you! However, that's your own
affair. I'm going to lay the situation be
fore M. de Lesparre and our committee of
patrons. They may judge for themselves
whether you are keeping to the compact
we made when we elected you. After all,
what does It matter to me, personally?
I shall send in my report and wash my
hands of the whole affair."
He rose as he spoke and picked up his
three cornered hat.
"Well, I'm going."
Qulgnonnefs face lost Its mocking
smile. '"Â¦':-{ :'-,:
"Sit down, sit down! What a vile tem
per you have! After all, we get along
very well together, don't we? Only I
can't do everything. I haven't Roth
schilds' bank at my back! Speaking can
didly, you ought to draw a little on your
parishioners. It's their turn."
' Mlnot let Quignonnet finish his phrase
without- interruption, his face remaining
unmoved. The Deputy Mayor arose.
"Let us go and smoke a cigarette iii the
summer-house. We can talk more at our
ease there."
The proposition was probably dictated
by a little malice, but the Abbe accepted
it for all that, in spite of the tropical as
pect of the garden.
They went and sat down in the arbor
erected at the corner of the boundary
wall. The Deputy Mayor offered a cigar
ette to the Abbe.
"You understand," lisped Quignonnet.
after he had puffed for a few seconds,
"I am quite willing to do all I can for you.
I know very well you don't put the money
in your pocket. Only I am not free.
Anquetin doesn't like priests. He is jeal
ous of them, and at our lasf meeting he
said that your schools cost too much."
"Anquetin said that?"
"Yes, Anquetin himself. He cited in
comparison with yours the one of the lit
tle 'Arts.' which pays for Itself.- and asks
for nothing from the districtâ nothing
even from the state. Why, would you bo
lievo it, they have even refused the mu
nicipal subvention actually dve 1 to them,
according to the compact for prizes and
material?"
"No, is that so?" said Mlnot. thought
fully. "They refused it, did they? Those
women are evidently rich. They are play
ing the disdainful. Ah! they have man
aged to entangle poor Sainte-Parade."
"They are your friends," said Qulg
â¢ nonnet.
"My friends!" muttered the Abbe, blow
ing out his smoke angrily; "they are a lot
of stuck-up blockheads! They have only
one idea, that is to walk without leading
strings, as thpugh they were grown up
people, although they are as ignorant of
practical lite as a novice in a convent.
They think I am stupid. They try to
soften me, to wheedle me, and then they
shut the door Inmy^face when I try to ;
show an interest in the affairs of the
school. I don't say anything, but I under
stand very clearly. Those who are not
with us are against us. Do you know who
it was who said that, you old manufac
turer of forged I. O. U.s?"
He slapped the Deputy Mayor on his
bony knee, causing him to Jump and make
a grimace.
"You don't know? Well, it was Our
Lord Jesus Christ, my Master."
There was a moment of silence. Then
Mlnot asked, slyly: "Are you people at
the town hall on good terms with the lit
tle 'Arts'?"
"Oh, Duramberty seems to take an In
terest in them. You know what people
"People sayâ people say! The truth is
that Duramberty is led by the nose. Just
as I am; and yet, in spite of the advances
he has made to that girlâ you know whom
I meanâ they will not let him even set
foot in the school!"
"H'm," replied Quignonnet, doubtfully.
"He gave his land free and has founded a
scholarship. He is not the man to spend
his money ror mere wind. Still, I have an
idea that matters have not been going
very much to his liking between him and
those women of- late."
He stopped, longing for. the Abbe to
question him, but the Abbe pretended to
take no interest In the matter. Throwing
away the stump of his cigarette, he arose.
"Well, good day," he said, carelessly.
"Are you in a hurry?".
"I have an appointment at the Convent
of the Sacred Blood, The Sisters want to
enlarge their establishmentâ to buy an
other site or enter into negotiations with
the proprietors of the neighboring prop
erty. In fact, they are considering a
pretty big project. Good day."

this that baby's serenity Is not ruffled. A
bit of medicated cotton, soaked in boracic

Then the head must bÂ© sponged. For

had had a poap bath the day before, so
to-dcy her Â»<ath is clear water, neither
too hot nor too cold. When such young
babies are bathed with soap the soapsuds
are put on before the baby is put Into the
tub.
A moment or two in the tub Is sufficient,
ar.d then baby is ready to come out. In-
Ftrsd of irritating her delicate skin by
nibbing it with a rough towel, the baby is
simply rolled in a soft towel to dry.
A bath for an older baby is given on'
practically the same prinicples. The tub,
tables nnd chalT are arranged in the same
convenient manner. The cotton-wrapped
finger is dipped into boracic acid and the
mouth, eyes and nose washed.
The head is next sponged, but the older
baby has graduated to the dignity of a
real sponge, instead of the piece of cot

By right of its added months the older,
baby is allowed to splash in the tub for a^

Among the exploded patriarchal tenets
is the fallacy that flannel should be kept
next to the skin all the year round, irre
spective of the weather.* Overheating is a
danger that has been sadly underestimat
ed. Regulate the clothing by the ther
mometer and do not by irritating woolen
contact torture and weaken the little body
already broken out with heat. Children
with the least teething: and bowel trouble
arc generally found to be those who are
clothed according to the temperature.
Bagging the baby-lf It 13 too \-oun* to
realize the possible. Ignominyâ has been
found a practical device for an emer
gency outing, if there is no time to strug
gle with buttons and mittens and coat
sleeves, or the little creature is too ner
vous or 111. For at best getting a child
ready is a tryinÂ«r ordeal.

A cap, with a frill to protect the eyes.
Bands or binders are emphatically con
demned. Warmth should not be supplied
in strips and sections, and the normal
child needs no support. If ever they are
required in peculiar cases a knit band is
used, or a flannel one cut bias to give elas
ticity, made without hems and reaching
from h'ps to armpits. Thus it is less apt
to striqg and get out _cf place. The diaper,
no longer an uncomfortable bungle, is
made either of antiseptic stockinet or is
shaped of cotton goods, -with an extra in
side piece about nine inches square. Linen
should never be employed for this or any
other baby garment. Where shirt and
long elastic stockings are worn the diaper
buttons above and below to these gar
ments, admitting of no gaps.
Many progressive mothers nowadays
are using only two garments upon very
young children, a flannel petticoat cut
princess and buttoned with soft buttons
on the shoulder, Its two seams being on
the outside, bo that baby's skin may be
spared uneven contact, and a high-necked
and long-sleeved stockinet top slip 'an inch
or so longer. This slip, woven In one
piece, does duty for a dress as long as
baby is kept in the recommended chrysalis
condition.
The pinning blanket or barrow coat â
that sine qua non of the provincial mother
âis relegated to the aboriginals who still
confine their young in bark or boards or

has had occasion to call out a single
time, "Will you never get that child
ready!"
The prudent mother, of course, provides
against sodden changes with extra gar
ments of her own devising. If embroid
ered shawls and- crocheted sacks are out
of date, there is no gainsaying tho cozy
princess wrappers of flannel or flannelet.

How to Give Baby the Morning Bath
Nowadays thirty-six Inches Is the maxi
mum length for outside rational grarments.
In contrast to the fifty inches and more
of a past decade. Many systems insist
that twenty-eight inches or at the utmost
thirty inches. Is the correct and sanitary
length.
The advantage of the abbreviated cos
tume in reducing to a minimum the
weight and pressure upon the small, nair
formfid bones is patent when one observes
a baby's knees, which are almost invaria
bly bent-the legs lifted and in motion.
Long draperies also imprison the stale
air and impede the circulation of the fresh
air
All dress reform for babies, whether fol
lowing one of the several specific systems
or evolved from the intelligence of the
individual mother, have the same under
lying common-sense principles.
The clothing must be light, warm and
evenly distributed, granting the body and
limbs perfect freedom.
It must be loose and of loosely â¢woven
textures, so as to permit tho even cir
culation of the air.
It must be easily put on and off. It
must invariably hang from the shoulders
and have neither gathers nor bands. It
must have as faw fastenings as possible,
and those on the shoulder. It must have
no pins at all, except perhaps In tne
diaper.

how they would shake their dear gray
heads with doubt and misgiving. For ba
bies' wardrobe has evoluted from the
fussy furbelows of yesterday, until now
supreme simplicity is the keynote of
baby's toilet.

its untrammeled legs and expanding its

This year's baby has been delivered
from the bonds of swaddling clothes and:
similar atrocities into the full liberty of
rational dress. Frills are tabooed as a de
lusion, and fancy touches are considered a
snare. The only necessities for a babe in
arms are creature comfort*. It merely
sleeps and vegetates, guarded from all
exciting influences, unrocked, unlullabied,
and whenever possible under the espion
age of a professional nurse, who exercises
a strict regimen., Until the little dormouse
has arrived at months of discretion tho
agitating onslaughts of adoring friends
and relatives are rigorously denied.

tested by the agents of Wells, Fargo &
Co. Probably $14,000 or $13,000 worth have
been brought from England during the
same time. One dealer has imported over
two hundred animals. As a partial re
turn t:pr;n this investment Los Angeles
has- Bent out during the last four months
about $?3.000 worth of stock, most of
which has gone to Central and Northern
California. Th*" Bonanza rabbitry, one of
the largest, has made shipments to Ala
bama. Illinois. Ohio, lowa, Nebraska.
Montana. Idaho and Washington, and
mary to San Jose. Salinas. Watsonvllle.
Santa Cruz and other points In Northern
and Central California.
The great Belgian hare exposition, mart
and feast held in Los Angeles during the
second w*>ck in February last afforded an
other striking test of the popularity of the
Belgian with all classes of citizens. It
was the largest and most Important ex
hibition of Belgian hares ever given In the
world. It was organized and conducted
by the American Breeders of Belgian
Hares, an Incorporation consisting of lead
ing breeders of Los Angeles and vicinity.
There were 1100 animals on exhibition and
360 hares passed through the hands of the
judge. The judging and scoring of these
required two and a half days of constant
work. There were some eighty classes
of exhibits and the first prizes ranged
from 115 to $00 for the American cham
pionship and 5100 for the International
championship, two firsts being given in
each class â one for the best buck and one
for the. best doe. The show was devoted
exclusively to Belgians and the exhibits
covered 13.000 square feet of floor space.
During the threo days which it lasted
there was an attendance of nearly four
teen thousand people.
The history of the Belgian In Southern
California has been similar to his history
elsewhere. The first specimens were very
common types, resembling the old Lepor
ine? and their crosses, animals of inferior
breeding. Then, as stcled. better speci
mens were secured and, finally, the best.
Ye-t the supply of the very finest breeding
animals is still extremely limited, al
though the average standard has been
greatly raised. If price is an index the
improvement In quality Is readily sh<)wn.
Two years ago the Bonanza rabbitry,
which was really the pioneer in this sec
tion, offered hares of age for breeding
at $10 for three, the best in stock. Now
the best In this rabbitry are not for sale
at any price, but a trio of the finest of
fered could not be bought for less than
JSOO. Three ordinary hares, such as many
people buy for "foundation stock," that
is. for the commencement of a herd, sell
readily In LO6 Angeles for $73.
From almost nothing two years ago the
Industry has grown In Southern Califor
nia until there are now about 900 breeders
in Los Angeles and its Immediate vicinity
and additions to this number have been
made morn rapidly during the past six
months than' ever before. A careful esti
mate placr-s the number of hares In
Southern California at 130,000. The total
valuation has increased during the past
year something like 160 per cent and dur
ing the past three months the average
price has Increased over 40 per cent. Bel
gian hare is a recognized dainty on the
tables of the leading hotels and restau
rants and in the homes of the rich.
The re-cognized types of hares now be
ing produced have been reduced to two
principal ones. These are the Flemish
Giant and the true Belgian. The former,
as Us name implies. Is the larger. In this
type the. early Leporine has been most
closely preserved. He Is a dark gray in
color and p.tmlns a weight of about four
teen pounds at maturityâ say at eight or
nine months. This type is considered the
best by most people for meat purposes,
but this view Is not entirely correct. The
Flemish Giant Is a loose-haired and loose
skinned animal and much of his bigness
goes to waste when he is slaughtered. At
least half is lost. Not more than a third
of the Belgian Is waste, and, moreover,
the flesh of the Belgian is daintier and of
a finer quality .in every way. Thus a
and all, of at least Jl3. and the original In
vestment is still left. This is a very mod
erate estimate. It has been far exceeded
In some instances.
We must not lose sight of the value of
the pelts, which are worth from 25 cents
to $1 each, according to their beauty, the
place at which they are sold and the use
for which they are Intended. In the East
there are some extensive establishments
raising Belgians principally for the pur
pose of manufacturing the hair of pelts
Into silk hats. They are also made into
rujrs. muffs, mittens, gloves, collarettes
and cloaks for ladles' and children's wear.
These are very handsome. . Dealers
abroad have r process. of "plucking" by
which some of the hairs - are removed." 1
leaving on the. remainder- of the fur a
rich, seal-brown color and luster. "A ma
chine has recently been invented which
accomplishes the same result without
plucking, simply by cutting off the dark
tips of the fur. This process Involves n->
coloring or artificial dyeing, although
there is another beautiful product, known
a3 "electric seal," which comes from a
process of dyeing. The pelt of the up-to
date high type Belgian is worth several
times as much as the pelt of the common
class of Belgians. .'
Â» The merits of the individual specimen of
the Belgian may be determined by a.well
defined standard of excellence which has
been agreed upon by leading fanciers the
world over.- This standard is based upon
a scale in which 100 means perfection.
The very finest specimens so far produced
score about .96â under -special care ! and
training for exhibition a score of 02 Is"
considered good. The following Is the
standard, with the number of "points" al
lowed to each subdivision:
. . â¢â¢" Points.
Colorâ Rich riifus red (not dark smudgy
. color) carried well down sides and hind
quarters, and as little white under Jaws
as possible 10
Tickingâ Rather. wavy and plentiful 13
Shape â Body long; well tucked up flank,
scientific turn In every thinking .man's
brain. It Is a well known fact that a type
may bo fixed In six generations â that Is to
say, you may take an ordinary animal, say
a cow or a mare, and by mating with an
improved specimen of the opposite sex'
produce a better offspring than the
mother. Repeat this process six times
and you have an animal which is entitled
to registration as a thoroughbred. This .
could be done in the case of the Belgian
in less than two years. AVhether carried
to this extreme or not, the -improvement
of the species has for any man with a
talent for this sort of development a most
profound interest besides the absorbing
excitement of a legitimate speculation. /
All of' these reasons are founded in the
more esthetic and refined phases of the.
industry- Besides these there is the com
mercial side. The Belgian, so far, has
uniformly afforded a profit. In this coun
try the highest profits have been In the
best stock, that taken up by the "fancy,"
so called. But as a producer of delicious
meat the Belgian has no equal,, for. the
size of the animal and the cost of meat
producing stock. The meat is all white,
tender and sweet. It 'has no '"wild"
flavor, but is very, similar to the best
chicken and turkey, with enough differ
ence to make It novel. One doe will read
ily produce six litters a year, averaging
eight to the litter. These will average at
birth three ounces In weight.* In fourteen
days they will -Increase In size five, or six
times, then weighing from fifteen* to twen
ty ounces. From this point they will gain
a pound a month to five or six months.
At maturity, from six to eight months,'
they will weigh eight or nine pounds each.
This meat sells readily at 25 cents per
pound dressed. Allowing one-third for
waste a doe will produce In one year 232
pounds of meat, ready for the market and
readily salable at 25 cents per pound. This
amounts to $63. The first cost of the doe
will not exceed $15 and her -keeping for
the year will be not more than' s3.' This
leaves a clear profit, over cost of animal
large Belgian, say nine pounds, would
really dress for the market as great a
quantity of meat as an average Flemish
Giant, say one of twelve pounds.
Besides these two principal types there
are various "sports" and freaks which
have been perpetuated as types, such as
the "blue fawn" Belgian, which has a
peculiar and beautiful fur; black Belgians,
and a few others. But these have not
been bred in numbers and are not widely
known. They will be sought to some ex
tent for variety, but will probably not en
croach largely upon the field of the stand
ard varieties.
Having thus stated the facts which es
tablish the undeniable popularity of the
Belgian and are familiar to hundreds of
people in Southern California, I shall state
some of the reasons which occur to me for
his popularity here and everywhere. The
first of these is his beauty. I shall dis
cuss this more at length in my description
of the Belgian In a succeeding paragraph.
The second is his docility and fondness for
fondling. .The Belgian makes a most at
tractive pet. He is intelligent, becomes
attached to his owner, can readily be
trained to pose and to come at call. â¢ He
appreciates care and good treatment. The .
third reason Is the Interest aroused In
every member of the family fortunate
enough to own Belgians by observing the
habits of the animal, especially of the*
does in caring for their young. As In all
wild animals (for the Belgian Is really a
wild animal domesticated) the mother love
Is very strong. All their habits of life,
the poses that they assume, their ways
of communicating with each other, their
care of their persons, etc., are. Intensely
Interesting. Every sound mind harbors
a love for animals, and the wild traits, v
such as are shown In the Belgian, are
those with which we are least familiar
and which are therefore most intensely
Interesting.
A fourth reason Is the fascination of,
mating Individuals so as to secure best
results in the progeny. This appeals to the
arid well ribbed up back, ulishtly arched,
loins well rr>und""l. net choppy, head
rather lonrrthy. muscular chest, tall
Â»trai|rht. not screwed, and altogether of a
racy appearance y>

Some points in the above standard will
be as unintelligible as Greek to the unin
itiated unless explained. The "ru^u* red"
color referred to Is very clearly defined
upon the body of a genuine Belgian of the
latest type, but It is difficult of descrip
tion or of understanding except by actual
sight. It is. however, a very rich color,
with a most beautiful and peculiar luster.
The "ticking" Is a tipping of black upon
the end of each hair over portions of the
body. This, as stated, should be wavy
I and heavy and abundant. The "lacing"
on the ear is a band of black, such as
might be made by a wide pen stroke with
a pen dipped in Jet black Ink. It extends
from the tip about half way clown the
ear on each side. The back of the ear
should be the coveted "golden tan" shade,
extending close to this lacing. There
should be a tint like a Gold or Ophlr rose
between the ticking of the sides and the
snow white of the belly. Some specimens
also have a creamy or golden tan shad-
Ing under the jar.-?, which is very beauti
ful. The tip of the tall should border on
golden tan, with snow white underneath.
The feet must all be a deep red. both the
front feet and the hind feet. This Is an
exceedingly difficult shade to obtain and
almost as difficult to describe. It resem
bles mahogany, but has a brighter lus
ter. It Is like a wine color, but not as
-deep a shade. It. mrght be called maroon,
'but is a little darker. Whatever It may be
called," It gives a finish to the whole effect
as yet rarely seen upon Belgians In this
country.
In any way that you regard the harmo
niously blended colors of the true Belgian,
his coat is a marvel and a delight. At
four months of age he molts and takes
on a permanent coat which la at Its best
at "eight months, but will deepen in the
beautiful shades in his next coat, which
appears at about the twelfth month.
I may condense all advice to the begin
ner into a few words, as follows: If you
are thinking of rearing Belgians, secure
the best manual or guide to the subject
procurable. Then prepare as large and
well arranged cjuarters for your rabbitry
as your purse will allow. Then secure
the best foundation stock obtainable,
having reference to quality rather than
to quantity. Care for them constantly.
Improve the progeny by Judicious mating
and success awaits you.
One of the best- unexplored fields open
to the breeder of Belgians to-day is Alas
ka, where meat is worth Jl a pound and
difficult to get at that. The Belgian 13
not injured by cold. He Is a fur-bearing
animal and never known to freeze to
death, and If protected from storms and
draughts will do well In severe climates.'
The young are born hairless, but are
shielded in a neat nest constructed, by the
mother and lined with fur plucked from
her. own breast. In two weeks 'they de
velop a fine. soft, lustrous coat. The hare
Is by nature a browsing animal and will
live upon barks, buds, brush and coarse
sticks, which serve his purposes almost as
well as corsets, tin cans and rock piles
serve the donkey and the goat. The man
who takes a hundred breeding does and
five or six bucks Into Alaska will have a
better thing in their product than the
best mine on the Klondike.

T> OXE familiar with the many
splendid qualities of the Be'.sriar*
hare It is exceedingly pleasant to.
either talk or write about it. This
Interesting little fellow, the most
modern addition to our domestic animals,
is noted for its remarkabV docility, giv
ing evidence of a disposition that is not
only attractive but really affectionate.
and appeals to every lover of animals,
and generally in connection with tha
eplendid financial returns in sight so
etrongly that there is no rest until on*
can claim a few specimens as his own.
It 13 the universal verdict of those whr>
know the Belgian that ad a meat producer
it far excel 3 in these fancy anl attract! vu
points any other of our domestic animals.
This adds materially to its value for this
purpose and partly compensates f,r the;
necessary care in breeding and raising.
Indeed. It is so attractive and susceptible*
cf such high breeding that thousands wilL
keep them solely aa fancy animals.
When all these points are considered,
along with Its remarkable fecundity, tha
small expense necessary to provide it with,
food, and the unsurpassable quality of tha
meat it produces, I should not be sur
prised to have it take such hold upon tha
people not only of Northern California but
all sections of the country as It has donu
in Southern California.
It must be understood that there are va
rious grades of the Eelgian hare, from tha
ordinary thoroughbred to the beau
tiful and graceful, even, dainty anl
inal, that scores from JH .to SS
point 3. being almost perfect in every
essential requirement. Such animals dif
fer from ordinary stock quite as much as
a Kentucky thoroughbred from a bronco.
This statement is based upon actual ob
servation, for the most perfect specimen*
of the Eelgian hare are owned in and
about Los Angeles, where they may bo
seen daily.
Some breeders were quick to realiza
that, as with other animal?, the bij?
money was to be made in raising the high
est types. These enterprising men not
only set about securing the best stock In
the United States, but. sparing neither
money nor pains, went to England ant*
in person selected the best specimens to
be found In that country. Almost all of
England"s latest prize-winners and cham
pions, together with the four Crystal Pal
ace cup winners of the last two years,
may now be found in the hutches of tho
leaving rabbitrles of Los Angeles.
This is a busy money-making age. and
while the Interest the fancier has In tha
Belgian hare may not be wholly prompt
ed by this sordid motive, yet the para
mount question with most persons con
templating going into the business is. will
it pay? t
Without attempting any exhaustive ar
guments in the affirmative of the proposi
tion. I have no hesitancy In saying that
If conducted on business principles the
Belgian hare Industry . will prove profit
able In all sections, as well as interesting.
I may point In proof of this assertion to
hundreds of people in Southern California
as well as elsewhere, who have not only
done well financially, but have made biir
money out of the Belgian bare. As a
money-maker, all_ things considered. It
has never had an' equal among all our
domestic animals. Some months ago.
while many were going into the business
in Southern California, the more timid
were afraid It would be overdone, but tha>
sagaclou3 far-seeinr breeders, realizing
that this is a great big cuntry, and know
ing tne ability e>f the animal to win ad
mirers wherever known. Invested heavily,
feeling assured that the demand for It
would be great. It. is needless to say that
they have not been disappointed, for tha
uemand has steadily grown, and to-day
the prospects for still larger business wera
never more promising.
Although the most prolific of all our do
mestic animals, yet many months must
neces?arily pass before the supply off
strictty high grade breeding stock will be
equal to the demand. Every city, every
community, must first be supplied wicn>
at least a nucleus for breeding, which cant
be done at prices that will prove amply
remunerative. This process of disseminat
ing stock throughout the country must
firvt go on before the meat can be offered
in the markets. It must therefore ba pat
ent to every Intelligent observer that
quite a money-making period will be of
fered breeders, especially to those on tho
cca3t. where the greatest Quantity oÂ£
foundation stock exists.
While the care and management of tha
Belgian hare is simple, its requirements
being few and easllv met. there are a
few suggestions which I wish to make and
if followed much trouble and even, loss
will be avoided. While the Eelgian. hara
la hardy and free from disease it muss
not be permitted to live in a draught.
Hutches must also be kept dry and per
haps the best method is to keep them well
bedded with straw and thoroughly cleaned,
not less frequent that even* other day.
Hutches should be constructed with threo
sides and top tight, the front being cov
ered with one-inch wire mesh. Whera
space 13 an object hutches may be built
three tiers high. Perhaps the most con
venient size is 3xt feet. However, to giva
the young the racy shape so much de
sired it Is necessary to put the doe wim
her litter in a run when they are threa
or four weeks old. The young may re
main here until _four or five months of
age. The bucks," however, should be sep
araied from the does when three months
old.
One other caution I wish to give, and
that is. the doe before littering must not
be highly fed. There 13 far more dan
ger In overfeeding during this period than,
there Is an underfeeding. After klndlin?
she must be fed liberally, but not with.
green feed untfl becoming accustomed to
It. With these simple suggestions followeel

BEFORE attempting a description o\
the Belgian hare I wish to set forth
the reasons for his great popular
ity wherever he is known and es
pecially in California. Not to go.
at present, into the details of his history,
we may say that England is still the.
world's center e>f the Belgian hare Indus
try, and LÂ»~s Angeles is its center in the
United States. This center, however, like
thÂ«Â» center of population, is subject to
change, and it may be that It will, in the
near future, be transferred to the north,
perhaps to San Francisco.
The Belgian hare has received his high
est development in England, where he
has passed through various interesting
phases, and England still sets the fashion
for the world in hares as in some ether
things. There, some fifty years ago or
n< re. certain people of an inquiring turn
of mir.d conceived the idea of breeding,
; ;Â¦ â¢.'-.t^r-mating different types of rabbit.
s rabbit tr.^t ?~hou!d resemble, as closely
as possible; the native, wild. English hare,
but Kith important improvements. The
wild hare is a slow breeder. The female
produces only two or three litters a year
:.iy two or three young at a litter.
Other breeds of rabbit are very prolific
The- wild hare pines away and dies In
captivity. Other breeds are easUydcmes
tktited. But the wild hare. In form, color,
action and all that goes to make a beau
t;"f!:l nrfrnnl f-.-?Â«s rharm< and rraept thnt
no other species possesses.
Therefore, taklnp the wild hare as a
model, the first experimenters selected in
dividuals of other varieties and mated
them to produce a progeny closely resemb
ling the wild hare. The wild hare will
Dot mate with any ether breed. If It
would tfcÂ«Â» problem bofore theiÂ»<s enthusi
asts in old England would have been vast
ly simpler than it was. Bet all efforts.
.â¢>n4 many have b^er: made, to secure a
cross between the wild hare and some
other variety have been utterly without
result.
The ond of th<Â» long series of experi
ments is the modern, high-class, thorough
1 rf<\ Belgian hare, and he is a very dif
ferent individual from those first ob
t.iinr-d. These latter were called Lepor
ine*. They were dark, grayish, spotted,
mottled beasts, far removed in beauty
fr^m thÂ» true Belgian as he exists to
day, with a ri<-h. "rufus red" as the foun
<i.-*r;Â«n of h's .Â«plendid glossy coat, and ap-
I r gf matins; far more closely than the
Leporine the beautiful ideal established
by the wild hare of England. Not only
iÂ« the modern Belgian very attractive in
appearance, but he Is exceedingly pro
lific, readily adapts himself to captivity
nr.r;. as a table luxury, his flesh Is a most
distinct and appetizing novelty. These
facts give him a two-fold value, first, to
the fancier and breeder on scientific prin-.
ciple-s, and. Eccr>r.'i. to the man of hum
b'er, perhaps coarser tastes, .whose soul
and pneketbook can be reached only,
through his stomach.

into Germany. France; Austria and espe
dally to America. These are the fancy
Individuals selected and exported for

r>l ihe Industry, that of providing a de-
Ucfooa article of food, has reached enor
mous proportions In Europe, and millions
cf pounds of hare meat are consumed
every week in the great cities of the Old
World.
The first importations Into the UnitM
States were made some Un years ago. and
JVljrians have sir.r-e then been reared on a
fmail scale at several points in the East.
But the center of the industry skipped
across the continent to Denver. There the
Belgian bc-came vastly popular. An asso
ciation known as the National Belgian
Hare Club was organized and did valu

tiflc. Soon thorc were four hundre-i breed
ers in Denver and vicinity. Finally some
of these set the fashion of importing
Men-priced Ep^imens from England, but
fifty or a hundred dollars was considered
a h:jg? sura for the best specimens that
cnuM be h:i>s. Here let me make a dis
tinction. I say "could be had." not "that
were in existence." for the Englishman,
I Itl I'i-h eager to secure what seemed to
him, and was. a \Ag sum of mon^y for a
little animal, was most reluctant to part
with the nery fir.r-.-t product of his pens.
and refused to do so until very recently.
In the meantime, while thÂ» Belgian was
multiplying and replenishing the earth in
I>Â«:;v. r. a few persons in Los Angeles
v. â¢ Â¦ becoming aware of his merit* and
wÂ«rr- gradually securing such specimens
es they could procure. By degrees they
established small rabbttries, which quick
ly grew. Some- eighteen months ago a few
of these breeders f._*it themselves strong
enough, in the numbers and q-uallty of
their herds, to. commence to advertise?.*
From th!s point the industry in Los Ari
pelr* tof(k an astounding impetus. Every
hing salable In Los Angeles chanped
hards at once. Denver was drained of Its
high-class stock. Then certain citizens of
Los Angeles set the telegraph and cable
to London into action and wired franti
cally for the best to. be had in England.
Other*; Impatient of delay and anxious to
ere- what they were buying, crossed the
â¢continent and th<? por.d and went in per
.pon to .London. The pressure of Ameri
can gold was too much and John Bull re
laxed his prapp upon his very choicest
product and closed his prip upon sums
that exceeded the wildest anticipations of
bis most extravagant dreams. For the
first time the finest specimens in the world
came to America and to Los Angeles.
To give seme idea cf the extent to
which this industry ha* advanced In

that traitors to the order have been

Nowadays Taos (the home and burial

the Penltentes. It is hidden away in the

the railroad, and is substantially the

over the other the Penitente beats the
yucca branch with all the strength of his
muscular arms. Then he scourges his
lower back. Sometimes he even -asks a
brother to lay the lashes on. Backs as
raw as beefsteak are common, and blood
trickles from hundreds of wounds down
the sufferer's legs. There are generally
some veteran Penitentes. whose wild fan
aticism finds the scourgings unsatisfac
tory. They bind for a few hours at a
times clumps of buckthorn cactus to %
their bare shoulders so tight that thou
sands of thorns sink deeply into the raw
flesh. It is wonderful that human beings
can endure such pain and blood-sheddintr
for a week. Fortunately for themselves
the Penitentes are generally stalwart
vaqueros.
Every night during Holy Week there
are pilgrimages in a body to campo
santo. At the head of the body strides
the "pitero" (flfer). who blows a shrill
unearthly wail, which will fill any stran
ger to Its notes with a nameles"s dread

where the Penltentes kneel, go throueh
a secret mummery, lash themselves a
self-prescribed number of times, and then
take up the backward march to the rno

The crowning event occurred on Good
Friday, when the anniversary o t chrÂ»Â«Â«rÂ«
death is celebrated with a drama of the
crucifixion. Honorary members of the or
der of Penltentes. known as Hermanos dÂ»
Luz (Brothers of Light), are called In then
to -assist in the passion play. Theso

.crudely thinks Is Pontius Pilate: another
wears white cotton robes and long whis
kers to represent Peter, and still another
young Penitente Is dressed in feminine
garb to represent Mary, the mother of
Christ.
At about 4 o'clock on Good Friday the
cruclflxlbn eeremonlcs begin. The Peni

pitero and the Hermano Mayor take their
places at the head of the procession. The

One cannot adequately tell the weird

(were black to his shoulder with blood
stains.
With the advent of Ash Wednesday the
fanatics of the order come from the
mountain settlements and gather secretly
at the morada. In each group or circle of
Penltentes there is the Hermann Mayor
(chief-brother), whose authority is su
preme. In tho old days he condemned to
death heretics who opposed the holy or
der, and his will was executed In divers
secret ways. Every one. of the forty Len
ten days is observed by the fanatics of
the order. The members live at the mo
rada, sleeping on the. earthen floor. There
are semi-weekly flagellationsâ the more
fanatical demanding extra scourging now
and then. Once every three days each
member of the order grappliÂ»s one of the
huge, heavy crosses, made of tree trunks,
alnioiu as large as a telegraph -pole in
glfth, and, with it across his naked shoul
ders, he starts dragging it to the c:ampÂ«Â»
santo (Calvary) and back â probably half
a mile of travel in all. The purpose' is to
make the Penitente humble and to better
appreciate the sufferings of the Master on
the true Calvary.
Cut when the last six days of Lent or
ITolv Week come the Penitentes re
double their efforts to square the reli
gious accounts for the year by a fanatical
stoicism probably unknown elsewhere ex
cept among the East Indian fakers. At
dawn every day in the Holy Week the
PeuifiEUstf give themselves scourgings
lacerations from recent flagellations. Some
backs are raw and bleeding.
The man who has been chosen the

a crushing weight of a heavy cn>33 of

that he has sought for these many
months. He is loosely wrapped about in*

In days when superstition was more
prevalent, the shape and appearance of
the fingernails were considered to forecast
one's destiny. To learn the messago of
the fingernails !t was usual to rub them
with wax and soot and then hold them
so that the sunlight fell on them. Then,
on the horny, transparent substance cer
tain signs were supposed to appear from
which the future could be Interpreted.
Persons having certain kinds of nails
were credited with the possession of cer
tain characteristics. Thus a man with
red and spotted nails was supposed to
have a hot temper, while pale, lead-col
ored nails were considered to denote a
melancholy temperament. Narrow nails
were supposed to betray ambition and a
quarrelsome nature, while round nails
were the distinguishing marks of lovers
of knowledge and people of liberal senti
ment. Conceited, narrow-minded and ob
stinate folk were supposed to have small
nails. Indolent people fleshy nails, and
those of a gentle, retiring nature broad

fluent command of English". Her voice is
Joy/ and musical, and like her husband
there is an unaffected dignity about her
every word and movement.
The Princess is taller than the average
Hawaiian, and her figure Is better propor
tioned. According to the standards of her
country this wife of Prince Cupid Is con
sidered very beautiful, and according to
the standards of this or any other coun
try ehe Is a gentlewoman.
The â¢ courtship of Prince Cupid ran
smoothly. The god. of love guided, his
namesake's choice wisely. It was a little
over four years ago that Prince Cupid re
turned to Honolulu, thinking to settle
down for life. _ Prince Cupid had spent
much of his time abroad. He had been In
California for severe! years, studying at
6t. Matthew's School, always returning
to his island home for the long vacations.
Then with his brother. David, he spent
two years at Kings College, London, Eng.
It was a well-educated, polished gentle
man that Honolulu found in Prince Cupid.
The royal family were proud of him, and
Honolulu society, with a capital S, pent
him cords to the. balls, teas and recep-
One morning Honolulu woke up rather
earlier than usual. The. city was in a
flutter of excitement. In the Government
.houses an extra force of guards was hold
ing prisoners a thousand natives. On the
street a crimson spot showed that warm
life blood had been spilled. Already black
crape fluttered in the soft breeze from
two or three doors.
â¢ So secretly had the Insurrection been
'planned, so unexpectedly had it been
'. frustrated, that Honolulu rubbed its eyes
Ito see whether it' was still asleep. The
â¢ story was soon told. The revolutionists,
j all strong royalists, had for come time
been smuggling In arms and ammunition
from San Francisco without arousing tho
suspicions of the officials.
At length they wore ready, and a thou
sand strong, they gathered a few miles
out of town to march in and by force of
arms take possession of the unsuspecting
government.' But on the very day of the
meeting a, native, who somehow knew of
their plans, in a drunken quarrel with a
foreigner boasted of the coming insurrec
tion. The' officials were at once warned,
and instead of surprising the government
they themselves were taken by surprise,
and marched to prison. Several shots
were fired, a few wounded and one or two
foreigners killed.
"It was soon whispered about that
Prince Cupid was among the prisoners.

Â¦This is where the story ought to end
with, "And the Prince and Princess lived
happily ever afterward.". But Â¦>, It only
turned a leaf and opened a sad chapter in
their lives. For a while all went merry
as a. marriage bell.. Though his wife was
hot 'of royal blood, she came from" a' good
native family and at once won the affec
tion of the Queen Dowager- and Queen
L.illuokalanl. Â¦ j Â¦,:'Â¦..-..
/.They had had a few weeks of uninter
rupted pleasure, and. then the stormclouds
which had been gathering over Hawaii
Net broke. .Queen Lilluokalani was de
throned and the provisional government
established. On tho heels of this camo
the republic - â _ â ..;.
â¢tood how Keenly the royal family felt thÂ»
changes, sympathized with Prince Cupid,
whatever their political leanings were.
He was given every chance to cover up
his tracks and escape the military trial
which followed the capture of the revolu
tionists. Prince Cupid would have none
of this. He would stand trial and take
his medicine like a man and prince of the
house of Kalakaua.
At the military trial Queen Ulluokalanl
herself was summoned, and though
threatened that the punishment meant for
her was death, bravely confessed that she
had aided and abetted the revolutionists.
It was thought best, not to hold the
Queen. Prince Cupid was the next pris
oner examined.
Prince Cupid did not gloss over his con
nection with ihe revolutionists. He ac
knowledged that he had been at the head
and front of thtm. It was not dragged or
tortured out of him. he told it quietly and
without faltering and awaited his sen
tence In calm dignity. Other persons
might crave mercy, but Prince Cupid
would not.
With the others Involved he was put In
to Jail. After Fix long months in prison
Prince Cupid was pardoned. Every one
in Honolulu was delighted when the pop
ular prince "was set free from durance

honeymoon for Prince Cupid.

forty years, and for Hawaiians that Is a

the har.da of care-takers, but it is harder

His wlf*Â» took out a portfolio of pictures
and lingering!:.- turned the pages, telling
the while of their home and the garden

horses and dog*, of their life of slippered

the Princess, "that, v/hen tho moon Is at

Prince Cupid was generous to a fault
with his money. The poorer natives found
him a willing almpgivpr, the better class
a generous host. Foreigners were not ex
cluded from his hospitality.. Many. we. t
the house parties and' stag dinners Prince
Cupid gave. But wh'en It came to losing:
his heart he went among his own people
and laid it at the feet of a pure Hawaiian.
Prince Cupid, like most young Hawallans,
has a sweet voice. "Aloha â oe," which
means "My love to you," and "Llke-a-no
l!ke"âAlways the same"â are the songs
which the Hawaiian swain pours Into his
lady love's ear. Prince Cupid sang, and
wooed as only an impatient lover can,
with the result that a few weeks after his
return to Honolulu ho had courted Â¦ and
married the loveliest native daughter of
the island.
Prince Cupid took his wife to his horns

the world over. The Holland room, a
quaint little place, is where Mr. Searl^
spends most of his time when home. The
grounds about the house are picturesquely
arranged. A rough stone wall encircles
the enclosure and here and there are little
peaks and pinnacles, stands forth ma
jestically and threateningly. The masslva
stone walls with the buttresses here and
there, and rising above 1* all a stona
tower, add much to the effect.
Mr. Searles personally is a very quiet
and unostentatious man, simple in hla
IT has been the custom lor y?=rs for
those who have an extra allowance of

Most prominent is the bust of General
Lafayette, said to be the most perfect
Ikeness of that famous Frenchman now
;n existence. On one side there is a bust
of Abraham Lincoln and on the other a
likeness of General Greene, while at the
back there is a bust of General Knox. The
figure of Washington Is remarkably
simple In its pompositlon. With ease
and grace the great general stands, the
loose cloak hanging from his shoulders,
the hands outstretched. Upon the faco
all is written that is good, noble and
true. The bronze work was cast in Mu
nich, as the foundries there are far su
perior to any other in the world for that
class of work. The actual work of mod
eling and sculpturing was done at Flor
ence, Italy, as Mr. Ball, although an
American, has passed a great portion of
his life in Italy, having lived there some
forty years. The famous quarries in the

the marble used In the work.

of Methuen, Mass.. a Ftatue of George
Washington, for which he paid $250.
000. It is perhaps one of the
finest monuments ever erected to the
memory of any man in mis country. The
titatue is the work of Thomas Ball, tho
eculptor. who has been so prominently
before the American public for years pant.
The train figure, that of George \ ashing
ton. was first exhibited at the World"*
Fair in Chicago, and there, on account cf
its great merit, was given * medal a::d ac
corded a prominent position on the fair
Mr. Ball spent some seven years on the
work, utterly ignoring mercenary consid
erations, as the statue could have been
finished in three years had Mr. Ball seen
fit to employ other hands than his own.
As it is the whole wcrk is the sole produc
tion of Mr. Pal!, with the exception of the
lronze eagles wblcti ornnment the base.
The work progressed s'.owly, as there was
to be no expense spared, and upon the
quality of the statue depended its suc
cess, the dos'.re being to bring out the
best In art. both to the honor of the
sculptor and the subject. The statue,
needless to say, is artistic, but not of that
Vcir.d which docs not admit of comprehen
sion outside of thoÂ«=e trained in art. and
which l>ecomes,orpres-Five to the ordinary
beholder. The Fculptor's conception is
perfectly intelligible, and does not fall to
awaken the admiration and artistic in-
Ftlncts cf the most untutored. As an ex
cmple of art It will stand forever symboli
cal of the rarly history of our country, as
every M n<> carved upon the surface of the
ptone tell? ;he story of 6ome historical
event of the past.
The public of Methuen were admitted
lor the first time to see the statue on
Washlnpton's birthday. The ceremony
v.-as simplicity lts'-lf. as Mr. Searles }s not
much given to the attendant fo!o>rol3
which generally accompany the unveiling
cf a statue, but in his unpretentious way
he and several workmen removed tlie veil
which hung about the colossal forms of
the figures.
The monument Is sixty feet In height
and Is rectangular In form, with a base
Jorty feet equare. There are four pro
jecting buttresses, each surmounted by a
figure. The figures are all; of heroic size
and represent "Oppression," "Rebellion."
"Victory" and "Peace." The figure of
Oppression Is that of & woman in' abject
icosi imposing. J.i is me ngure oi a man,
large and strong. One hand grasps tight
ly his sword, the other he holds over % hls
heart The veins in his arms stand out
with the pent-up passion within him.
Upon his face is written determination.
The eyes look far Vhead and from the
eet lips one expects to hear the words,
"I will." In historical succession is the
EtatuÂ© symbolical of "Victory" repre-
eentea By a woman who, wreath in
hand, glories in her success, yet ever for
giving those who , were her enemies.
"Peace" is depicted by the figure of Cln
ctnnatus, who, laying aside his arms, , is
now, ready to resume his plow 'and the
tilling of the soil. The spaces between
the figures have each a collection of
trcphles surmounted by a huge eagle.
There are four -Â¦ niches In the die base
that he was born, and , here he has lived
for many years. His old home, the house
in which he was born, ; has been rebuilt
and remodeled and the grounds Improved
until now Pine Lodge/ as It is called,' is a
typical country seat ; and one of the' finest
in the land. The style of architecture em
ployed is jc*;cidedly classic in design, .the
motif being Grecian. There are numerous
wide verandas supported by ..white marble
pillars. A stone arcade surrounds an In
ner court, which is laid out after the old
plan of the houses of ancient Athens,
with splashing fountains and here and
there a classical statue.
.The interior of Mr. Searles' house is
Ideal and there Is none of that showy ex
pensivenes3 generally found In the homes
of the rich. ' Each room Is essentially, art
istic ', and I la ' them â¢ can . be found _ rare . bits
towers, much after the style of the melie
val age. Directly In front of the main en
trance to the grounds there is a stono
fountain, such a one as might have stood
at one time in historic Pompeii.
Approaching Pine Lodge from a distance
one might well Imagine himself ap
proaching a castle in the feudal days of
old England. Above the dense foliage of

He does not believe In luxurious display
or ceremony. To see him about his
grounds one would not for a momer.:
think that he wa3 the proprietor, but
rather one of the employes. The manner
In which the great statue of Washington
was unveiled tells its own story of the
man.
There is much to keep Mr. Searles quite
busy, as there are now several buildings
under construction which he has donated
to different cities of the United States.
Among them is a high school now being
erected at Methuen at a cost of $100,000.
The celebrated Boston organ, which was
at one time in Tremor.t Temple, has been
purchased by him and will be set up at
Methuen as soon as the organ hall, now
under way. Is completed. The organ Is
the largest In the world .and stands fifty
five feet in height.
The hall for its reccpMon will he 100 by
73 feet and will cost $10,000. An organ fac
tory has been built by Mr. Searles near
his residence, which he will personally
conduct, and it is his Intention to manu
facture the very best which money and
expert labor can produce. What will be
done with these organs is a matter of con
jecture, as Mr. Searles is not making
them for his own pecuniary benefit. Be
sides attendins'tp these many things Mr.
Searles owns and manages a ranch of
some two thousand acres near his home.
which gives employment to some three
hundred men in and about Methuen. "?At
Great Barrington. Mass.. there has been
erected a school at tlie cost of $73,000. also
the gift of Mr. Searles: and to Eowdoin
College. Vermont, he has donated a Col
lege of Sciences.
The Mark Hopkins Institute of Art In
this city is not the least of these bone
factions. The new gallery lately erected
cost $40,000. This Institute serves many
purposes. It has one of the best art
schools in the United States. Its gallery
la, not excelled anywhere in size and In
ppace for exhibiting pictures in proper
light. It is the headquarters in this city
for the State University. There the re
gents have most handsome and suitable
offices. There university extension lec
tures are given, and there take place all
of the university public receptions that
have to be held in San Francisco.
When it is remembered that Mr. Searlea
,-nakes all this possible by givins annually
the money to take care of these buildings,
keeping them clean, repairing, painting
and Improving them. u.e completeness of
his generosity must be appreciated. The
Art Association could not begin to sup
port such quarters and the university
could not afford such an expense for its
regents' meetings and its public re<?ep
tlons. The gift, therefore, is a continuing
one, deserving the gratitude of the State
as well as this city,-

CITY OF MEXICO, April 7.â Details
of a duel In which the principals
and seconds were women prominent
In Mexican society have just come
to light. One woman was so seri
ously wounded that a surgeon had to be
called and this led to the arrest of the
participants. The duel grew out of a love
affair.
Rafael Riquelme went to a fashionable
ball several nights ago, accompanied by
Senorita Marta Duran. a belle of the city.'
Senorita Juana Luna, to whom Riquelme
had been paying marked attention, aiso
attended the ball, and she saw Senorita
Duran in the company of Rafael. Her
Mexican blood surged In a passion. She
confronted Senorita Duran, and after a
quarrel challenged her rival. The chal
lenge was accepted and the next morning
the two women and four seconds drove in
two carriages to a vacant lot near the
Romlta outskirts of the city. The rivals
stripped off their waists and the signal for
the encounter was given.
The first round was bloodless. In the
second round Senorita Duran was aggres
sive, while her opponent acted on the de
fensive. Senorita Duran's terrific thrusts
began to tell upon her strength and then
Senorita Luna, who had been waiting for
her adversary to tire lierself, took advan
tage of her weariness and made a savage
lunge at her breast. She inflicted an ugly
wound, but Senorita Duran again faced
her and received a scratch on the cheek.
In the third round Senorita Duran was
weak from the loss of blood. Senorita
Luna inflicted a wound on her sword arm.
She dropped her weapon and the duel was
over. The women kissed and the van
quisher] one in true chivalry fashion re
nounced Roquelme.
The seconds placed the wounded woman
in a carriage and drove her home. S Her
condition becamp so serious that a phy
sician was railed in. Under the Mexican
law no physician ls..perinlttei] ;to t#?nt a
wounded person without an order from
the authorities. The cage was presented
to the police inspector and an investiga
tion brought out the facts. Senorita
Duran was taken -to Juares Hospital and
the other five persons were arrested and
placed in solitary confinement at Belem.

After daylight this morning it became
evident that the situation was serious.
The river began to rise so rapidly that
It was evident that the immense dam and
all the power houses and contents, costing
one and a half million dollars, were in
imminent danger. To add to the terror
of the situation, small frame houses,
trees and debris of every description be
gan descending the river and piling up
against the upper face of the dam. This
weight was augmented every moment un
til by 10 o'clock there was a mass of de
bria lodged against the dam which threat
ened the safety of the structure. In ad
dition millions of gallons of water, muddy
from its long, journey, was whirling and
plunging to the sixty-foot fall, and It was
evident that \no wall could withstand tho
Immense pressure.
The crisis came shortly after 11 o'clock,
when suddenly- with a report like the roar
of the ocean the great wedge twenty-five
feet high, 600 feet wide and about eight
feet thick rolled out of the center section
of the dam down the face of the sixty feet
fall.' deep Into the river below. This left
a hanging gap in the very middle of the
dam through which the debris and water
fiercely poured, while the flood â¢ already
raging was threatening everything In Its
path. "'Â¦Â¦".'; :-_: -_ . ~
The released water poured into the
power house, catching eight. employes at
work there, drowning all of them. The
breaking of the dam caused wild excite

look out for the great wave, and runners
were dispatched on horses to notify those
living in the valleys below the city. The
telegraphic messages served as a timely
warning to many, but the rushing waters
outstripped the horsemen and many
houses were picked up and swept away
before the occupants could get together
their valuables.
Within- a short time air the valleys to
the south and west of Austin were filled
to overflowing with water and the south
ern portion of the city tributary to the
river was inundated.. Large crowds col

is to-night in pitch â¢ darkness, with
a raging river, a mile wide and
swollen far beyond . Its natural
banks, roaring and surging through
all the lower portion of the town, hav
ing spread destruction and death in Its
wake. In addition to the vast loss of
property interests It is calculated that
between thirty and forty lives have been
sacrificed and the reports coming in from
the tributary country to-night do not tend
to improve matters. The flood is 'not un
like the disastrons Johnstown flood some
years ago. In that a raging river, already
swollen far beyond its capacity, bore too
heavily upon an Immense 'dam spanning
the river here, breaking it and letting
loose a reservoir of water thirty miles
long, half a mile wide and sixty feet deep
to aid In carrying destruction down the
valleys of the Colorado River.
The great dam In the Colorado River
gave way at noon to-day from the enor

workmen.

the Boer plan may bÂ« to break up the railway
between NorvaJs â¢ Pont and Bloemfontein. by
means of which Lord Roberts secures his sup

successful, would cause Lord Roberta some em
barrassment, and might draw him Into making
a strong counter stroke toward the south. It
proves, at least," that the Boers have now
discovered that . their best .course; Is to rely
upon strong raiding parties moving rapidly,
rather than upon a war of positions wherein
they must always In time be overborne.
But the effect of the new Boer policy will
be merely to hasten the development of the

have beÂ»>n the result of increaslnz their em

of the war being fought out to the end, as was
the â¢war of recession.
In that case months must elapse before tbÂ«
close of hostilities. The most disagreeable
feature of to-day's news Is the uneasiness . of
the Basutos. The situation In the Free State
is one of some difficulty, and may cause tem
porary anxiety, but unless & serious blow is
struck at the communication of the British
army, the Boer raid will have little effect.
Even the temporary destruction of the railroad
would cause no more than a diversion.

HEAVIEST STORM IN YEARS.
SAN ANTONIO. Tex.. April 7.â The
heaviest rain and electric storm in thirty
flve years visited San Antonio and the en
tire Southwest last night, destroying all
street lights, flooding cellars and over
flowing San Pedro Creek and San Antonio
River.
The only train into San Antonio to-day
was on the International and Great
Northern from Laredo. No trains have
gone out. Railway bridges in all direc
tions have been washed away. No tele
graphic communication can be had west
of Del Rio, on the Southern Pacific, and
the damage beyond that point is not
known. It, will be many days before the

directions, indicating a repetition of the
disasters of last year. The loss of life to
a great extent has already surpassed that
of previous years. Both telegraphic and
telephone service all over the State is
completely prostrated and details from
the flooded districts are very meager. All
streams, the Brazos and Colo

OFFICER SHOT
AT ESQUIMAU
BY A SENTRY
Lieutenant Scott Is Seriously
Injured and May
Claimed That He Did Not Answer the
Challenge and Was Mistaken for
a Spy by the Man on
Guard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 7.-Lieutenant
Reginald D. Scott, navigating officer of
H. M. S. Pheasant, is dying at the Naval
Hospital as a result of wounds Inflicted by
Gunner Higgins of the Royal Marine Ar
tillery, who was one of the guards on
duty at the naval yard last night. Hig
gins, who is awaiting court-martial in the
guardhouse, alleges that he thought the
lieutenant was a spy.
It seems that Scott is an officer of the
watch, which, since the opening of the
war and the prevalence of Fenian reports,
has been doubled and instructed to fire
on any one not answering a challenge.
Scott has been in the habit of endeavor
ing to surprise sentries, and he landed
at the lower and seldom used end of the
yard. Higglna saw him and challenged,
and on receiving 1 no answer fired two
blank cartridges. The lieutenant then
started to run and the sentry fired two
balls into his chest. H%must have been
running backward, for when the search
lights were placed on the scene
from all sides when the sentry's carbine
was heard the, lieutenant was seen in a
heap on the ground and the sentry stand
ing over him. Scott was carried out of
the yard with two bullef wounds in the,
region of his lungs. He was then rowed
acroÃÃ to the Naval Hospital, where he
now lies. His death is expected at any
moment. . .
Higgins was arrested and will be tried
by court-martial. It is openly asserted at
Esquimau that there has been great fric
tion between the naval men and the Royal
Marine Artillery, to which Higgins is at
tached. Scott before had trouble with a
guard, which matter furnished the basis
for. remonstrance from the commander of
marines to Captain Fagen, who is in
charge in the absence of the admiral. .
Although the measures taken by sen
tries noy are extreme, the presence of Fe
nians in the city seems to warrant them.
A few days ago a sentry at Macaulay
Point fortifications discovered a man over
the chevaux-de-frise of entanglement,
with which the forts are protected. The
sentry tired two. shots, but the man es
caped, leaving behind him the 'board by.
means of which he attempted to gain en
trance. Many daring, attempts have also
; been made to .destroy property v. at the

a man was arrested who eaid that he and
others had determined to destroy the guns
even if they paid for it with their lives.

MARGUERITE SILVEY
ACQUITTED BY A JURY
While Testifying for Herself the
Young Woman Broke Down and
Her Mother Fainted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MERCED, April 7.â The jury in the Sil
vey case rendered a verdict to-night of
"not guilty." The day was occupied in
examining witnesses, and this morning
Lace Sllvey, brother of the defendant, was
placed on the stand, and during the tes
timony he was interrupted by the mother
of ! the prisoner fainting. She was re
moved from the courtroom and restored
to consciousness.
After Lace Silvey had given in his testi
mony the defendant took the stand and
recited her relations with Thomas, telling
how he promised to marry her and of her
trip south when she thought that she was
being taken to Los Angeles, but instead
was taken off at Fresno, and on account
of Thomas not having sufficient money to
get married she was compelled to return
to Merced, he following four days later.
She was very nervous during the time she
was testifying and finally broke down,
the court excusing her until the after
noon session, when she resumed the stand
and continued the story of how Thomas
had deceived her.
After the examination of the witnesses
for the defense the case was submitted to
the jury without argument. They retired
to the jury room and in a few moments
returned with the verdict that acquitted
the young woman of the crime.

Congressman Needham Recommends
Reduced Duties on Fruit for
-^ : the Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â Congressman
Needham has recommended to Assistant
Secretary of "War Melklejohn that the
duty on canned fruits and vegetables sent
'to the â¢Philippines be reduced. The duty
now is Â¦ 2 tents per kilogrammeâ several
times the first cost of. the goods in Cali
forniaâand . is practically prohibitory.
Needham suggested a duty of 2 cents a
kilogramme, or ,15 per cent advalorem, the
latter a. trifle less than the former. The
purpose^ of. this is 1 to give California fruit
growers and' canners a chance to market
their goods>in the Philippines.
The agricultural appropriation bill re
ported 'to the House to-day contains an
item appropriating $35,000 Jor general irri
gating purposes. The California delega
tion'had hoped for an appropriation Â¦of
$50,000, but is quite satisfied with the sum
allowed in the present bill.
Senator. McÃride to-day Introduced an
amendment intended to be proposed to

JAILER SHOT
AND PRISONERS
GIVEN LIBERTY
Arizona Train Robbers Re
leased by Treachery of
a Trusty.
Desperadoes Have Taken to the Hills
and the Chances Are That They
Will Escape Across the
Border.
Special IMBpatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., April Zâ A sensational
Jail delivery took place at noon to-day at
Tombstone. Jailer Braven was shot by
Billy Stiles, a guard, who was also a pris
oner awaiting trial for train robbery.
Stiles testified against his companions,
who comprise the gang that held up the
Arizona and New Mexico Railroad train
at Fairbanks two months ago. For taking
this course the jail authorities allowed
Stiles the freedom of the jail, and re
cently he was engaged as a guard to
watch over his companions behind the
bars. The Tombstone jail contained the
Halderman brothers, who are sentenced
to be hanged, and the gang that robbed
the train at Fairbanks. The- District
Court convenes next week, when the trial
of the train robbers was set.
Stiles had evidently planned the killing
and the escape- of the entire crowd of
prisoners, for at noon, when Jailer
Braven came, Stiles stepped up behind
him and fired, and the jailer fell to the
floor. Stiles then took the keys of tho
cells from Braven and opened the door
which led into the inner corridor. Burt
Alvord and Bravo Juan's cells were un
locked by Stiles, and these desperate
characters were soon free. Horses had
been engaged by Stiles and placed in a
convenient place for the fugitives. Stiles
did not have time to liberate the Halder
man brothers, for the firing was heard In
the town and men were rushing toward
the jail. Stiles joined Alvord and Bravo
Juan, and the trio started toward the
mountains. They went in the direction
of the Chiricahuas, and in half an hour a
posse, headed, by Sid Mullen, Deputy
Sheriff, was in pursuit.
Another posse was organized in Tucson
this afternoon and left the city on a
special train for Cochise, from where the
posse will ride to Tombstone and take
the trail of the fugitives. The posse
from here is composed of Sheriff Wake
field, Special Detective Thacker, Nabor
Pacheco and Luke Allen.
The fugitives are bad men and will
make a desperate fight before they are
taken by officers.
Burt Alvord was constable of Willcox
until six weeks ago when he was ar
rested by Detective Thacker, who
charged him with being the leader of the
gang that, held up a train at Fairbanks.
He is also held for complicity in the
Southern Pacific hold-up at Cochise eight
months, ago. Itwas in the Fairbanks hold
up that Jeff D. 1 Milton was badly wound
ed after killing Three-Fingered Jack, one
of the robbers.
A message was received from the posse
to-night which said that the fugitives
were going toward Mexico and Tomb
stone and the posse was in hot pursuit.
Bravo Juan Is one of the most desper
ate men in Arizona, and with a shrewd
desperado like Alvord with him the
chances of escape are good. It was
feared that an attempt would be made
to deliver the prisoners confined in the
Tombstone Jail and Judge Davis yester
day authorized Sheriff Scott White to em
ploy two guards. Jailer- Braven died late
to-night. â¢-.".' â¢

Assessments Too Low.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ© Call
SAN DIEGO. April 7.â Mayor Capps is
preparing his annual message to the City
Council, which will be presented about
the middle of this month. Among other
things he will call the attention of the
Council to the fact that an immense
amount of personal property is escaping
taxation, and will possibly by name refer
to some of the large stores here whose
proprietors have returned exceedingly
small stocks. Another- suggestion he will
make will bs that the present assessment
be raised 10 per cent. The assessment roll
of the city has shrunk from about $20,000,-
POO to 513,000,000, and that is not a good
showing, though every one knows that the
difference was on account of the boom
values on outside lots.

CHILDREN GIVE
NOISY GREETING
TO THE QUEEN
Fifty Thousand Irish Lads
and Lassies Cheer for
Victoria.
Dublin's Royal Guest Greatly Af
fected by the Heartiness of
the Juvenile Demon
stration.
Â» Â¦
DUBLIN, April 7.â The children's dem
onstration, which closed the Queen's week
In Ireland, was probably one of the most
gladsome days either the Queen or Dub
lin has known in years. Certain it is
that the Queen Is making fresh conquests
dally, and her Majesty's many acts of
personal self-sacrifice have completely
won the hearts of the people of Ireland.
To-day's demonstration had elements of
Joy which the Queen has experienced but
seldom In the recent gloomy months.
There were miles of cheering children
under a continuous canopy of . fluttering
nags, with a background of thousands
of holiday-making elders who accom
panied them. The charming weather
tended to make the celebration in every
way delightful, not only to the Queen,
but to the little Princes who followed in
the royal procession
The genuineness and spontaneity of the
children's welcome kept her Majesty in
continual good humor and yet visibly
affected her deeper feelings as well. The
fact that 50,000 children arrived and de
parted from Dublin without serious ac
cident, so far as known, is not the least
remarkable feature of the day.
On Monday the Queen will pay another
visit to Dublin and the event promises
to be quite the equal of her flrst entrance
Into the city. The route will be through
one of the important districts not yet
visited by her Majesty and was arranged
at her own request >to gratify the pre
viously disappointed public.
Commenting upon the seizure of the
United Irishman the Dublin Independent
condemns the action of the authorities as
"stupid and Inopportune." It says:
"Looking through the issue we find many
coarse and insolent references to the
Queen and the Lord Lieutenant which no
one with the instlnrts of a gentleman
could attempt to defend, but, abusively
offensive as they are, they afforded no
Justification for suppression."
The Freeman's Journal remarks: "The
castle has again acted with its usual
crass stupidity. Such unwarrantable in
terference with the press without a trial
or warning would never be attempted or
tolerated in England. The castle au
thorities deem the Queen's visit as an
auspicious moment to emphasize the dif
ference between the two countries."

KESWICK, April 7.â Keswick has the
highest brick smokestack in Northern Cal

Keswick will soon have the largest oil
tank in Northern California. The Moun
tain Copper Company is now building one
that will hold 123.000 gallons. The smelter
company is going to use crude petroleum
as fuel for its reverberatory furnace, in
which it has hitherto used dally one car
load of the very best soft coal.
Eugenio Rodriguez resisted the execu
tioners. Before he was subdued five offi
cers were required to overpower him. He
addressed the crowds on his way to the
platform, declaring his innocence and
blaspheming and cursing every one in
spite of the efforts of the priests.
The women along the route of the pro
cession waited and wept as the condemned
men went by. A halt was made near the
platform and the carts proceeded singly to
the steps. Some of the condemned walked
up but others had to be carried to the
platform, where they were seated and
bound, with their backs to the posts. As
the executioner tightened the screw rap
idly the bodies twitched for two or three
minutes and then all was over. The of
ficials of this place censure the American
authorities for permitting the Spanish
mode of execution, although they favored
the death penalty belnjr inflicted. The
crowds dispersed In an orderly manner af
ter the execution and the business houses
were reopened.

APPEAL FOR MERCY
TO QUEEN VICTORIA
Parents of Anarchist Sipido Ask
That She Intercede on Behalf
of the Lad.
BRUSSELS, April 7.â The parents of
Jean Baptiste Sipido, who made the at
tempt on the life of the Prince of Wale 3,
have addressed the following petition to
Queen Victoria:
Tour Majesty: Two unhappy parents wish to
tell you their despair and Implore your pity. It
Is a father and a mother who beseech your
Majesty to pardon an unfortunate son for an
attempt whereof he has been gTillty. We are
poor, even In Indigence, but we are. honest.
Neither of us has ever failed tn our duty. Our
child, who has committed this fearful crime,
is an Innocent lad. acted on by evil incite
ments. They have taken advantage of his in
experience, but he understands now the char
acter of his act and weeps with us and Im
plores pardon, O Queen.
We have nine children, all still little, and all
come to you with the same prayer and the
same supplication. For to your gracious kind
ness they look for help.
Our child Is In prison. The idea of it Is too
horrible. Have pity on us. Have pity on him.
His crime was hateful, but he Is our child.
His heart Is good and reproves his act. It
seems to us impossible that he can be con
founded with criminal wretches.
At your knees we pray you to Intercede in
his favor. He is only 15 and was a moat re
spectfnl, submissive, loving boy, with a heart
of gold, knowing nothingâ a boy whom they
have wickedly decel\-ed by odious lies. Inducing
him to fire at your most esteemed son, his
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.
Great, noble Queen, deign to cant a look of
pity on our misery and our llfÂ« will be but onÂ»
outpouring of gratitude and respÂ«ct to your
roost , august, merciful Majesty.

sent to the- Prince of Wales.

PARIS INVADED
BY THOUSANDS
OF AMERICANS
Advance Guard of Visitors
to the Exposition
Arrives.
With One Accord Hotel Proprietors
of the French Capital Raise Their
Bates to Exorbitant Di
mensions.
>
'opyrlghted. 1900. br the Associated Preas.
PARIS, April ".âThe advance guard of
the army of foreigners Invading Paris for
th? exposition has made its entry and a
very large proportion are Americans.
Every moment of the day one now sees
cabs flying about the boulevards, loaded
with Saratoga trunks, while the familiar
American accent Is heard in restaurants
ar.d other places of popular resort. The
hotels are already filling up and the prices
of everything are rising. In fact, these
flrst arrivals form a sort of a forlorn liope
on whom the hotel and shopkeepers are
experimenting with Increased charges.
Not only visitors but permanent resi
dents are beginning to feel the burden of
the advanced rates. Most of the hotels
have bo raised rates that the regular
guests are obliged either to leave or ac
cept poorer accommodations. Those who
are unfortunate enough to have only
monthly leases on their apartments have
been notified that their rents will be dou
bled for six months after the opening of
the exposition. The cab drivers have an
eye on preater wealth and trying to ar
range with the Government for increased
fares.
At the exposition itself everything Is
bustle and confusion. Heavy draught
teams line the streets adjoining the expo
sition buildings, waiting to deposit their
loads of exhibits. The American exhib
itors are finding themselves seriously
handicapped in preparing for the installa
tion, owing- to the unexpected congestion
on the Railways between Havre and Paris,
and aiso on the tracks within the expo
eition grounds. There is a continual
struggle between the representatives of
every nation to get cars into the grounds,
but the French people hold the key to the
situation and take good care that their
own cars are taken to their exhibit space
and unloaded before those of the United
States and other nations. Russia and Bel
gium are the only countries favored.
United States Commissioner General Peck
is disturbed by this situation, and in or
der to expedite matters has stationed
men along the railroad from Havre to
Paris, for the purpose of pushing through
the cars carrying American exhibits. â¢
Some alarm was recently created by the
discovery of a few cases of smallpox In
Paris, especially as the discovery was
made on the eve of the exposition, and
for a short time there was a great de
mand for vaccination. Medical statistics
just published show, however, that there
is little ground for anxiety, as the disease,
which made its appearance at the begin
ning of the year, has now practically dis
appeared. In all only nine deaths have
been reported among a population of 2,
600,000.

Minister of Finance
Miquel.
Assault Made on Prince of Wales
Looked Upon Merely as a Young
ster's Escapade by
Berlin Press.

BERLIN, April 7.â Regarding Ger
many's.projected new commercial treaty
policy various semi-official utterances dur
ing the past week show the imperial Gov
ernment does not intend to deviate from
the protective tariff policy. In no case
will there be a lowering of duties. Fi
nance Minister Miquel, in hia own organ,
the Poltische Nachrichten, says:
"At present the Government ia consid
ering whether It is advisable tc> introduce
maximum and minimum tariffs instead of
the present system of a uniform tariff
scale. There are many reasons for argu
ing in favor of such a change, especially
the assurance thus given to every branch
of trade arid Industry that no matter how
the treaties are finally concluded a cer
tain amount of protection against foreign
competition is vouchsafed. This applies
still stronger to the productive and agri
cultural classes."
The South. African war throughout the
week was commented on in the usual
spirit. The smallest success of the Boers
was magnified p.nd hailed, while the Bri
tish successes were belittled.
To-morrow's Die Woche will contain an
article from the pen of Major, yon Fran
coles, late Governor of German Southwest
Africa, interestingly weighing the chance 3
of Boer treks to that German colony after
the war is over. The author on the whole
considers the Boers would be an undesir
able element.
As further details about the attempt on
the life of the Prince of Wales at Brus
sels CQmÂ© In the German press changes
its cue and considers it In the light of a
farce. The Voerwaerts to-day, grouping
all the evidence, says:
"The whole thing was a dumme dungen
strelch (youngster's escapade), and it is
preposterous to seek therein proof of in
ternational anarchism or any politics
whatever."
Mr. Andrew D. White, the United States
Embassador, has secured passage on
board the Deutschland for July 29 alone,
mailing from Cherbourg after viewing the
Paris Exposition hurriedly. He will at
tend his daughter's wedding and will visit
Washington before returning here.
Mr. White has sent some reminiscences
of Tolstoi and others to a New York mag
azine and has about finished a long his
torical work.
CHINA WARNED

THE "BOXERS"
Given Two Months in Which

Representatives of the United States

Ultimatum to the Peking
Government.
LONDON, April 7.â A special dispatch
from Shanghai announces that the Ameri
can, British, French and German minis
ters have sent a. Joint note to the Chinese
Foreign Office demanding the total sup
pression of the society of "Boxers" within
two months and announcing that other
wise the powers mentioned will land
troops and march into the interior of the
northern provinces, Shantung and Chili,
in order to secure the safety of foreigners.
According to the same dispatch the
American, Italian and French legations
are now provided with naval guards from
the large gathering of warships at Taku.
Liv Kun Yin, Viceroy of Lang Klang,
has had three audiences with the Dowager
Empress relative to the Emperor, and It is
believed he has impressed her with the
advisability of restoring his ilajesty to
.power.
WASHINGTON. April 7.â lt Is said at
the State Department that the last heard
from Minister Conger of the United States
within the last few days was that there
was no substantial chanpe in the situa
tion in China. The Minister has not in
formed the department of the concerted
action of the powers reported from Pe
king. It is said here that so far as the
United States Minister is concerned noth
ing has been done to commit the United
States Government to action in combina
tion with the powers. Mr. Conger's in
structions enabled him to make as strong
a presentation as he may deem necessary
of the desire of his Government that full
protection should be extended to Ameri
can residents in China. It was entirely
proper for him to couch this demand in
strong language and even to intimate the
intention of the United States Government
to undertake through its own agencies to
supply the needed protection to our citi
zens should the Chinese Government fail
in its duty in that matter. In doing this
Mr. Conger might have acted in precisely
the same line as representatives of some
of the great European powers at Peking,
but the officials are confident that he did
not become a party- to any concert of ac
tion. The United States Minister was spe
cifically Instructed on this point that he
must act on his. own responsibility, and
while his course might lie parallel to that
followed by other Ministers resident In
Peking, he must under no circumstances
join with them in a concert.
Just how far the Minister has gone In
theÂ«dlrection indicated is at present un
known here. The naval officers do not
believe that he has yet summoned a naval
force from Admiral Watson's command
to guard his quarters at Peking, for In
such case, they assume, the naval com
mander addressed would have notified the
Navy Department by cable. The Minister
appears to have anticipated the necessity
for something of the Kind, however, for
a month ago. he suggested to the State
Department the expediency Of having Â«
warship. â¢ .

SLIGHT WOUND
FOR DUELIST
SAINTE A LERY
Little Blood Shed in a Two-
Hours' Combat at
Paris.
Result of the Second Affair of
Honor Resulting From the De
Lubersac-De Rothschild
Quarrel.
>
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Fress.
PARIS, April 7.â A duel between Comte
de Deon and M. de Sainte Alery, the re
spective seconds of Comte de Lubersac
and Baron Edouardtle Rothschild in their
quarrel, was fought this morning in the
Hippodrome at Neuilly le Vailois. De
Sainte Alery was slightly wounded in the
sixteenth onslaught and the duel waa then
stopped.
The combat lasted nearly two hours.
M. de Sainte Alery, who was slightly
wounded in the right arm, was taken
home at once. Count de Deon fought In
dehance of his doctor's orders, who coun
seled a further postponement of the duel
owing to his sprained wrist.
The talk of society is of the crop of
duels springing from the De Lubersac-De
Rothschild quarrel, which is really the
lirst fruit of the present anti-Semite ma
nia. The whole affair is of trivial origin
dating from" the school days of the two
principal actors, when 'on one occasion
Count de Lubersac found Baron Robert
de Kothschild in possession of the college
tennis court and asked him to quit. De
Rothschild rtiused, and in the course of
a dispute which ensued De Lubersac
called him a "dirty Jew." The resultant
ill feeling lasted during the remainder of
their college days.
Comte de Lubersac was recently a mem
ber of the jockey club. An unpleasant re
mark was repeated to him. which he at
tributed to Ms old disputant, and he
thereupon wrote an insulting letter to
liaron Robert de Rothschild. Although
the seconds decided that the lact that the
baron wa3 a minor debarred him from
seeking satisfaction, a meeting between
the two is only postponed, as De Roths
child is determined to settle the matter
upon the field of honor.
Three other duels, of which one was de
cided on Wednesday and one to-day, are
the Immediate outcome of the quarrel ana
are directly traceable to the hostility of
the rival Semitic and anti-Semitic cliques.
The offensive reference to De Roths

uating that he is a "Jewish coward."
made In the letter written by the Comte
oe Deon and Comte Bonl de Castellane in
their capacity as De Lubersac's seconds,
brought a challenge from M. Sainte Alery
to Comto de Deon. who was the principal
second of De Lubersac.
This attack on the De Rothschilds is
considered most unkind, as they are re
markable for their generosity toward all
charitable undertakings In Paris.

MRS. DEWEY'S
STATEMENT TO

the Candidacy, of the
Admiral.

Declares That She Attempted to Per

?
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
LINGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, April 7.â With the consent of
the admiral. Mrs. Dewey made this
formal statement this morning with
a view to offset the impression that she is
responsible for her husband becoming a
Presidential candidate:
"A correspondent said T am responsible
for my husband becoming a Presidential
candidate. So far from this being the
case, I attempted to persuade him from
this course, realizing the grave anxieties
and responsibilities surrounding a candi
date."
When I called to-day and requested per
mission to see Mrs. Dewey I was first
greeted by tho admiral, who, being told
of the object of my visit, exclaimed:
"Why, of course Mrs: Dewey has a
statement to make. Come right in."
Mrs. Dewey was conversing with her
mother. Mrs. Washington McLean, who
had called to see the. admiral and Mrs.
Dewey, to hear all about their outing in
Philadelphia. Mrs. Dewey was cordial in
her greeting. She wore a becoming house
gown of crimson taffeta silk.
"Yes," the admiral went on to say, with
a twinkle in his eyes, "Mrs. Dewey wants
to make this statement because she wants
the people to know who is master in this
house, for Mrs. Dewey told me at the
time I deeded the house to her and then
to my son I was very foolish."
. Two women reporters were announced
just then. They had come from New
York tho day the official announcement of
the admiral s candidacy was made, and,
learning that Mrs. Dewey had accom
panied the admiral to Philadelphia, they
went there and again returned in quest
of an interview. Mrs. Dewey began her
statement, but was interrupted constantly
by, "Mrs. Dewey, is this all you are going
to say?" and entreaties that both the ad
miral and Mrs. Dewey make no other
statement to any other reporter. Mrs.
Dewey read on patiently, not losing her
temper in the least, but the questions not
ceasing, she exclaimed:
"I reserve the right of every American
womanâ to speak when I wish and am so
Inclined."
Mrs. Dewey told me she and the ad
miral would go to their country place,
Beauvoir, on Monday next and remain
there as quietly as possible until their
Western trip. They expect to go to some
Northern vaterlng place later in the
summer, but their headquarters will be
at their country home here until mid
summer.
Mr. Chartran, an artist of New York,
will come to this city next week to paint
portraits of Admiral and Mrs. Dewey.
It Is Admiral Dewey's purpose to make
his future statements to the public
through the medium of communications
either to his personal political advfsor3
or as addresses to the public and to au
thorize publication through all' newspaper
channels at the same time. He also in
tends to make these statements few and
far between.
Admiral Dewey said to-day that he
probably would not make more than one
official statement, in which he would
briefly but emphatically define his at
titude on all of the leading national ques
tions. When he will make this statement
he does not himself know. J He .said he
desired to consult with some of his ad
visors, but his mind was already made
up as to the kind of platform upon which
he desired to run. Admiral Dewey will
go to his country place on Monday and
in the quiet of this place, after hearing
from the "astute men" who, he says, are
interested in his candidacy, he will begin
the preparation of a letter setting forth
his views on leading issues.
The admiral is still reticent as to who
these "astute men" are and seems some
what uncertain as to the prospects for
any thoroughly well-defined, organization
for conducting his campaign.

NATIVE DAUGHTERS TO
BEAUTIFY REDWOOD CITY
Have Raised Sufficient Funds to
Transform California Square
Into a Park.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 7.â The local
parlor of Native Daughters, which has as
sumed the responsibility and expense of
beautifying California square, a block of
land In the heart of the town, has suc
ceeded In raising sufficient funds to war
rant them in proceeding with the work.
For a number of months past the Na
tive Daughters have been working with a
will upon the matter and have during this
time given numerous benefits and enter
tainments, and the public has responded
freely.
Already the unsightly trees and fences
have been removed from the square and
recently a contract was awarded to
fill in the park with good, rich soil. It Is
thought that it will cost about $1280 for
the filling alone.
As soon as this part of the work Is com
pleted a landscape gardener will be em
ployed to lay out the park and plant lawns
and shrubs.
A large artificial pond. with a fountain
In the center will be constructed, and
when the work Is completed the park will
be turned over to the town authorities.
who will thereafter see that it is properly
kept in order. As the town owns the
water system, the cost of maintaining the
park will be comparatively small.
The Native Daughters deserve great
credit fpr the work they have undertaken
in thus beautifying the town.

a skilled San Francisco architect as as
sistant to the supervising architect of the
Treasury In preparing plans and specifica
tions, and for whose services $25,000 was to
be appropriated, but Secretary Gage does
not approve this provision and recom
mends its elimination. He suggests that
the limit of cost of the building, exclusive
of site, be fixed at $1,500,000. In conclu
sion Secretary Gage says:
. "The building now occupied as a
Custom-house was erected nearly fifty
years ago, and is In a very crowded con
dition and entirely inadequate for the ac
commodation of the business of the port.
It would appear that a port of the im
portance of San Francisco, the receipts cf
which are increasing every year, requires
a more commodious building in order to
properly accommodate the constantly
growing business."
This indorsement by Secretary Gage
will undoubtedly have great influence
upon the committee, from which a fa
vorable report at this cession is confi
dently expected.
DEMOCRATIC WHIPS
HUSTLING FOR VOTES
All Members of the House Minority
Urged to Work Against the
â¢Tariff Bill.
WASHINGTON, April 7.â The Demo
cratic members of the House held a cau
cus to-night to determine upon plans in
connection with the approaching vote on
the Porto Rican bill. About ninety mem
bers were present. The chief attention
was given to the question of pairs, as the
vote is expected to be so close that the
result may depend upon the pairing of
members. On motion of Underwood of
Alabama, the Democratic whip, the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
Resolved, That all Democratic members are
urpfpd to return to Washington at once.
That hereafter Democratic members will
make no general or permanent pairs.
That all pairs shall be made in writine and
shall be signed by one of the members desig
nated by our party caucus to arrange pairs.
Richardson, the Democratic floor leader,
offered the following resolution, which
was iinanimously adopted: . .
Resolved, That as a party we declare our
unalterable opposition to the measure . now
pending before Congress entitled "A bill tem
porarily to provide revenues for the relief of
Porto Rico," and hereby enjoin upon every
Democrat to be present In the House of Repre-'
Bentatives when the vote is taken thereon and
Another resolution by Underwood was
adopted asking Democratic members to
remain throughout the Porto Rlcan de
bate and, whenever reasonably possible,
to remain until the end of the session of
Congress. It is expected that the action
taken will enable the minority to make an
exceptionally strong showing against the
bill when the vote is taken next Wednes
day.
HARVARD MAY PAY
EXPENSES OF CUBANS
Objection Made to the Taking of Sub
scriptions for the Maintenance
of Teachers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. April 7.â lt looks as if the cor
poration of Harvard University would
take upon itself the expense of the main
tenance of the Cuban teachers during their
stay at the summer school, as well as the
expense of tuition. This matter will be
definitely determined at a meeting of the
corporation next Monday. In the mean
time the matter of selecting a general
finance committee has been held In abey
ance. It was feared that a general sub
scription would give the impression that
the object was in a certain sense a chari
table one. and such an impression would
entirely destroy tho effect of the good
work which it is hoped will be accom
plished by the visit. Hence the proposi
tion to place the matter entirely under the
direction of Harvard men.
Superintendent Frye is advocating the
celebration of the Fourth of July this year
with special reference to Cuban inde
pendence. In this project he has found
interested coadjutors in the Sons of the
Revolution and also in the daughters of
that respective body. Walter Gillman
Page and General Francis Appleton have
shown a warm interest in this idea, and
some of the veterans of the Cuban war
have expressed a desire to co-operate in
such a scheme.
REDWOOD CITY NOMINEES.

urer and Marshal.

REDWOOD CITY, April 7.â The regular

urer and one Marshal. The last two offices
alone will be contested, there being but
one nominee each for the balance of the
offices. .
Those whose names are on the ballot
are: For Trustees â James V. Swift, George
W. Winter and E. M. Hanson; for Clerk-
Daniel R. Stafford; for Treasurer, L. P.
Behrens and Philip Princevalle;.for Mar
shalâJohn Christ and Colon Stafford.
Bond Election Held.
Special Dispatch to The Call
SONOMA, April 7.â A bond election was
held here to-day for the purpose of voting
$20,000 for a municipal water system. This
is the third election held for that purpose
within the past two years. The proposi
tion being defeated twice, the City Trus
tees were desirous of submitting the ques
tion a third time, which has resulted In 9S
in favor and 58 against. A two-thirds ma
jority being necessary, the proposition
lost.
Will Issue Bonds.
RIVERSIDE, April 7.-An election was
held here to-day to decide the question of
the Issuance of $10,000 bonds for an electric
light plant, the proposition being carried.

With the Money Thus Acquired the

Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press
LONDON. April 7.â Superlatives have
been almo3t eliminated now from the war
comments, and with the <!isappearance of
possible foreign complications the editors
and public speakers take quite a moderate
tone and treat what is happening in the
war field with a certain historical per
spective. The depressing incidents of tho
week have caused Englishmen to resign
themselves to a long struggle. The dis
position to find fault with the War Office
tor not having anticipated the necessity
for the enormous number of horses seems
unjustified, for it is learned that before
the dash on Kimberley and the destruc
tion of horse flesh caused by the sur
rounding of General Cronje the War Of
fice wired to its agents all over the world,
particularly in North and South America,
giving them unconditional power to buy
horses unlimitedly until further orders.
The conditions in the way of assembling
and transporting the animals were such,
however, that horses bought a month ago
can hardly reach Lord Roberts before
June.
Nothing more was heard this week of
the movement Initiated by the Ministerial
members of the House of Commons to
Setition the Government to proclaim the
range Free State annexed to the British
empire.
London bankers are transmitting' gold
or Its equivalent regularly to the Trans
vaal In paying checks of British officers
who are held prisoners, and the Standard
Bank of Pretoria honors all such checks.
Therefore, as no limit is placed on the
luxuries bought by the prisoners they 'ive
in much comfort. In fact, their messes
are probably much better provided than
are those of the officers at Bloemfontein.
Some of the captives have been there four
months and have a regular service via
Hamburg and Lourenzo Marquez, which
brings them good things to eat. smoke,
drink and wear. The British officers box,
fence and play various games, including
billiards, an old table having been bought
in Pretoria.
There is no disposition hero to make
much over the attack made on the Prince
of Wales by Kip:dio. the anarchist lad. at
Brussels Wednesday, while the Prince
was on his way to Copenhagen, but the
British see in it the direct consequence of
the continental press Attacks on Great
Britain in connection with the war. Thus
the London Times says:
"The suppression of notorious facts, the
propagation of glaring falsehoods and
truculent abusiveness operating on weak
minds are almost certain, sooner or later,
to have an issue in actions from which, to
do the writers justice, they would shrink
with horror."
The Times holds the German press espe
cially responsible for the personal scur
rillitles directed against the Prince of
Wales, referring to the Kladderadatsch,
which is not a Socialist sheet, but which
ranks up toward London Punch. . Such al
leged scurrlllitles as the Kladderadatsch
prints are systematic, yet the Times avers
that the German press Is controlled, guid
ed, cajoled or coerced by the Government,
and that the German law of lese majeste
is the most stringent in Europe.
The fourth number of the Anglo-Saxon
Review appears this week with a gorge

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 8, 1900.
The notable feature of the discussion was
an eloquent speech delivered In support
of the amendment by Vest of Missouri.
The amendment was pending" when toe
Senate adjourned, the voto upon it dis
closing the fact that no quorum was pres
ent.
The discussion of Government support
of sectarian schools was precipitated by
the following amendment, offered toy
Jones of Arkansas:
That the Secretary of thÂ« Interior may make
contracts with present contract schools for thÂ«
education of Indian pupils during thÂ« fiscal
year endinr June 30. 1901, but shall only make
such contracts at places where the Govern
ment hae not provided school facilities for all
thÂ« children of school age residing- thtreat,
and to an extent not exceeding the number of
children In attendance at said contract school
at the close of the fiscal year ending June 30.
IKK).
Thurston, in charge of the bill, opposed
the amendment, taking the position that
the Government should pursue a policy of
providing for its own schools. He depre
cated any reopening of the question which
six years ago had been a subject of dis
turbance and serious discussion through
out the country. The matter, he thought,
had been settled at that time by the adop
tion of a policy of reducing the appropria
tions for contract achools 20 per cent each
year until the contract schools should
nave been abandoned entirely. He con
cluded by saying that the Secretary of the
Interior had advised the committee that
all Indian pupils could be provided for in
the Government schools. He deemed it
the true policy of the Government to car
ry on its Indian schools without reference
to any religious sect. He regarded, too,
any agitation of tho subject as unwise.
Jones' PlÂ«e for thÂ© Red Man.
Jones made a strong appeal for thÂ«
adoption of his amendment. Ho said It
was not a revival of the contract system,
but was a proposition simply to permit
tho Secretary of the Interior to enter into
contract for the accommodation of the In
dian pupils who could not be accommo
dated in the Government schools. He de
clared that if such an amendment as he
had offered were not adopted 2GOO Indian
pupils would be without school facilities
after the present fiscal year, as it was
well known the Government schools were
entirely inadequate.
Kyle expressed th* opinion that the
proposition involved a mixing of the
church and state that waÂ« undesirable.
"I don't believe it's a mixture of church
and state." said Jones. "This is simply
a question of educating these childrenâ a
question of justice."
Teller said he was assured that even if
the amendment were put into the bill it
would not be enacted into law. He
thought, therefore, that the Senate better
endeavor to provide some other means of
educating the Indian children.
Thurston said the contract schools were
established by the Catholic church for
missionary purposes ard for the advance
ment of a great Christian purpose. He
said that the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs had authority now to purchase the
buildings of the contract schools, but the
Catholic church, desiring to continue the
work of the schools, declined to sell them
to* the United States.
Vest of Missouri, prefacing his remarks
by the statement that he had always been
a Protestant and had no sympathy with
many of the dogmas of the Roman Cath
olic church, pronounced a brilliant eulogy
upon the Jesuits for their work among
the Indians. In the course of his remarks
Vest paid tribute to Booker T. Washing
ton for his great work among the colored
people of the South. He took off his hat,
metaphorically, said he, to Mr. Washing
ton. Professor Washington had struck
the keynote of the great negro problem,
he said, by teaching the colored youth
how to labor. This, he added, was the
true secret of the success of the Catholics
in thejr work among the Indians. They
taught them how to work.
Jesuits and Their Work.
This great undertaking had gone for
ward until. Vest said, the American Pro
tective Association and .the cowards who
were afraid of it had struck down the
appropriation for the continuance of the
work. He declared that he was ashamed
that any American should uphold such
work of a secret political society. He
would denounce it if it were the last act
of his life.
He ridiculed the American Protective
Association for adopting a resolution de
manding his impeachment for saying on
the lloor of the Senate what he was now
saying. Vest eloquently told of the re
sults of the work of the Jesuits among
the Flathead Indians, saying In this con
nection:
"I say now there Is not in thÂ© world
an object lesson so striking as may be
seen from the windows of a Northern
Pacific train as it passes through the
reservation of these Indians. The Jesuits
have rescued these Indians from degra
dation."
He said the Jesuits were not doing the
work for love of the Indian, but "for
love of Christ."
"I am not afraid to say this, because
I speak from personal observation. In
my opinion every dollar put by the Gov
ernment into the Indian day schools
might as well be thrown into the Po
tomac River with lead weight attached,
or burned up with the idea that the
smoke by some mystic power of idolatry
would accomplish the work for which it
was appropriated."
"I don't believe." said Lodge of Mas
sachusetts, addressing the Senate in a
brief reply to Vest, "that it is right to
tax one man to support another man's
religion."
Upon that proposition. Lodge main
tained, it was not right to appropriate
the Government money to support any
branch of the Protestant church, yet
when he opposed the payment of money
for the support of Catholic contract
schools he was called a "bigot" or an
"insectivorous politician." It was a plain
and simple principle, he said, that the
public money should not be used for the
support of any sect or religion.
Vest asked Lodge if he had not support
ed the taxing of Catholics in -Massachu
setts for the support of the common
schools. "' Â¦Â¦'. Â¦-*-_:
Lodge replied that he had, but as the
common schools were open to all and
taucht no creed he regarded thÂ© taxation
as perfectly proper.
Duncan's Efforts Praised.
Gallinger of New Hampshire opposed
the proposed amendment in an earnest
speech, in the course of which he referred
to the work done by Mr. Duncan among i
the Metlakatla Indians. In a brief speech j
Shoup of Idaho called attention to the fact j
that while Mr. Duncan's work was tho '
most notable, in his opinion, ever accom
plished by one man among Indians, he '
had performed it without ono dollar or as- '
sistance from the United States Govern- j
mfnt.
The debate was closed by Carter of
Montana, who pleaded for school facili
ties for the Indian children in Montana.
He could conceive of no religion that
would lower the condition of the North
American blanket Indian. He said there
were 1070 Indian children in Montana to
day who would have to be educated In the
contract schools or go without education
in any form, as the facilities supplied by
the Government were absolutely inade
quate. He was strongly of the opinion
that in the circumstances the facilities of
the contract schools ought to be utilized
by the Government. /
An aye and no vote on the amendment
was demanded. The vote was: Ayes, 14;
noes, 21â no quorum, and the Senate ad
journed at 4:50 with the amendment still
pending.

THE Examiner, in freak and frantic editorial, in
quires: "Why has Porto Rico been deprived of
the equal rights of an American community?"
We suppose that it is because the Examiner's doctrine,
declared more than a year ago, that Congress can
govern external possessions unlimited by the consti
tution, has been applied to Porto Rico. That paper
now attacks the Republican party for "governing
Porto Ricans as the serfs of Congress."
That is just the way the Examiner said they would
and should be governed when it was running its
widely known and justly celebrated policy for
America and Americans, and was shouting, "Take
Porto Rico and nail the flag to the Philippines!" It
shouted in very large black type and said in its more
subdued editorial typography: "It is in the right and
power of Congress to devise any sort of system that
may apply to the conditions of such dependencies,
and this power is in no wise limited by the national
constitution. * * * All these things are matters
cf common knowledge."
Yes, certainly, and, being so, it is also matter of
common knowledge that Porto Rico has never had
the equal rights of an American community, and
therefore has not been deprived of such rights.
Having informed everybody that Congress can
govern these dependencies without limit from the
constitution, the Examiner can only object to the Re
publican way of doing it, and not in the name of any
iigrht Porto Ricans have as an American community.
The Republican policy is to hold fast to the doctrine
cf protection to American labor. It proposes to deny
free trade between this country and our dependencies,
in order that American workmen may not be brought
into competition with the low wages of the tropics.
The Examiner demands free trade, regardless of the
effect on American labor. It is a question of policy
and expediency, and not of constitutionality, for the
Examiner expressly excluded the constitution from
our dependencies in the days when it was shouting for
their acquisition and nailing the flag to divers and
sundry places.
The Examiner and Colonel Bryan and Chairman
Jones and Congressman De Armond are in a delight
ful mixup on this subject. Jones says the Paris treaty
pave to the people of Porto Rico and the Philippines
the constitution and all the rights and immunities of
American citizens. Colonel Bryan says, "I favored
the ratification of the treaty of Paris," and adds: "The
Filipinos cannot be citizens without endangering our
civilization. I am not willing that vie should bring
in 10,000,000 Malays and make them citizens here. I
am not willing to destroy our civilization."
But Chairman Jones says the treaty which Bryan
says he favored makes them citizens. Therefore, when
Bryan supported the treaty he supported the de
struction of our civilization, and, as far as Porto
Ricans are concerned, the Examiner girds at the Re
publicans for not extending to them, and therefore of
necessity to the Filipinos, "the equal rights of an
American community.**
The Bryan Democratic policy is as fine a lot of jar
pon as has been heard since the bricklayers on the
tower of Babel called for "more mort" in tongues
which confused the hod-carriers.
Huntington, it is reported, has visited the harbor
of Santa Monica and looked with sad eyes upon

It was stated some time ago that the admiral and his good wife Intended to
make a tour of Europei. Dewey ought to purchase the tickets right away and
keep his wife away from telephones and telegrams until after the next November
election. Otherwise she is liable to make him look more foolish In the eyes of
the American people than he does at present. A word to the wise should be suf
ficient. But the Old-Man-in-the-Hands-of-His-Wife seems to be far from wise.

While opinions may differ more or less radically as to the wisdom of Admiral
Dewey's course in announcing himself a candidate for President, no one will
question his right to seek the nomination. It is, however, a long distance from a
man's personal announcement of his candidacy for the Presidency and his in
auguration as President. As to the latter event the Times is perfectly confident
that 1901 will see a repetition of the agreeable national episode of 1597.

A Presidential candidate without a party and without a platform might provÂ»

this nation. At least, until the people know something of Admiral Dewey's. poli

SLUM GOVERNMENT.
' I 'HE people of this city do not want a slum gov
j ernment. Since the election of Sutro the city
has been under a Democratic executive, sworn
to enforce the law. That is a long period in the life
of a city. Mayor Phelan came in 1896 and has had the
city in his hands ever since. He has been three times
elected Mayor upon reform issues. Is it not about
time now to let reform appear?
It was said the city could not be purified under the
consolidation act. All of the evils against which
moral people complained were excused on the ground
that the city government had no power to destroy
them. More power was given in the new" charter,
which is now being administered by those who
claimed to be its only friends. Still evil is ram
pant. Vice has grown faster than the population,
and we have here exactly the same immoral condi
tions which offend the senses in cities that are not
under a reform charter administered by its friends.
The Mayor has absolute power. He can remove any
unfaithful officer,' whether appointed by himself or
elected by the city. The new charter equips him with
abundant instrumentalities for the suppression and ex
pulsion of vice and the punishment of crime. If San
Francisco deserve the strictures passed upon its
morality, the fault lies with the Mayor.
All he has to do is to lift his hand and the sins and
crimes and vices which beset the city vanish as did
the plague of rats from Hamelin when the Pied Pipe"
appeared.
Mr. Reed, a member of the Board of Supervisors,
objected to an air-tight anti-vice ordinance because
he said it would violate the obligation of the Demo
cratic party to the sporting fraternity for political
favors in the recent election.
The people want no such payment for political
favors. The integrity of the community is of more
importance than such reward for votes that conferred
power.
Under Mayor Phelan the city has been a wide
open town, and those who expected that the new
charter would close it learn now that they were mis
taken.
As usual, an effort is made by the city government
to divert. public attention by carrying on active opera
tions against the Chinese. Whenever slum govern
ment wants to profit by white vice it begins yelling
about the grewsome vices of the Chinese.
The people want the efforts of government ad
dressed to all vice and transgression, regardless of
the color of those who offend. If slum government
made Chinatown moral and orderly, that would not
void its responsibility to make the whole city moral
ar.d orderly.
There has been much chloride of lime scattered in
the Chinese quarter. Let us see some chloride of
moral duty scattered all over the city.

TWO SCHOOLS TOO MANY.
SCHOOLS, whether public or private, classic or
industrial, sectarian or liberal, are good things;
it may be added they are among the few
good things of which no nation can have too many;
and yet there are nt>w proposals in the East for the
establishment of two schools, which, if carried out,
will overdo enterprise in the way of instruction, to
the extent at least of expending money and energy
for schools we do not need. .
Of the two establishments one purposes to main
tain itself, but the other asks for an appropriation
equal to that now given to the Military Academy at
West Point. The first school intends to teach the art
of playing baseball and football. It is designed for
the benefit of young men who wish to become pro
fessional players, but have not the means to take a
university course. The other is projected for the
purpose of training young men for the consular ser
vice, and, like the first, aims to relieve youth from
the necessity of attending the instruction given at
the universities.
Of the two schemes the more objectionable is the
one that seeks an appropriation. A school for Con
suls at the expense of the Government is so unneces
sary, and its maintenance would be such a waste of
public money, that the only thing which could give it
a degree of merit entitling it to a liberal appropriation
would be its location in San Francisco. If it be lo
cated here it will be a due recognition of the right
of the Pacific Coast to have one of the great Govern
ment schools, and on that score an appropriation for
it equal to those granted to West Point and Annapolis
combined would be expedient, but on no other
ground could it be commended at all.
At the present time our universities afford a fairly
good opportunity for young men to learn football,
baseball and consular lore. If the instruction they
give be not sufficient, it can be easily expanded, with
out any elaborate expenditure for new buildings, new
gymnasiums and new playgrounds. The larger the
number of students gathered in any one university
the greater- will be the stimulus flowing from,compe
tition. For that reason,, therefore, anything which
tends to diminish the, number of young men likely to
enter our universities is to be deplored â unless, as we
have said, the new schools are designed to provide a
means for doing justice in the way of appropriations
for: the Pacific Coast at large and San Francisco in
particular

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION.
THOSE PORTO RICAN TEARS.
WHEN the claims of the United States against
Great Britain growing out of the damage done
to our shipping by the Alabama were sustained
by an international tribunal there was a well nigh uni
versal sentiment in this country that the settlement
i of disputes between nations by arbitration was some
: thing like a heaven inspired policy, and that nothing
j would ever incline enlightened men to oppose a re
! sort to it. Since that time the decisions of such
I tribunals have not been so much in our favor, and
I little by little there have grown up doubts whether
arbitration be after all the best way of settling dis
putes in accordance with justice.
The recent decision of the Swiss arbitrators on the
American and British claims against Portugal for in
| jury done by the seizure of the Delagoa railroad has
started an earnest discussion on the expediency of
trusting all controversies between nations, or the
j claims of the people of one country against the Gov
1 ernment of another, to arbitrators, and a consider
able number of the disputants frankly declare against
j the practice.
The facts of the case are not subject to dispute.
The Portuguese Government granted to an English
I company a concession for the construction of the
j Delagoa Bay railroad, and the company gave the con
j tract for constructing it to Colonel McMurdo, an
American contractor. After a great deal of the work
had been done, but before the road was completed,
| the Portuguese Government confiscated it, and thus
j caused a heavy financial loss, not only to the British
company, but to the American contractor. The
i British claimed damages to the amount of $7,500,000,
and on behalf of McMurdo a claim was made fo>"
â¢ $1,500,000. The sum awarded by the Swiss arbitrators
J amounts to but little more than $3,000,000, and the
I long delay, eleven years, in making the award adds to
the irritation felt at the comparative smallness of the
damages granted.
It has been suggested that the Swiss arbitrators
fixed the award at a small sum so as to enable the
Portuguese Government to pay it promptly and thus
escape any obligation which would give the British
:a shadow of right in seizing Delagoa Bay at this
j juncture
The New York Time 3 in commenting upon the
! case says: "It is impossible not to see some 'polities'
jin such an award. Probably the London Times may
! be right in suggesting that the arbitrators fixed the
i sum at what Portugal could afford to pay without bor
1 rowing. .But another London journal seems to be
equally right in saying that the result of the decision
will be the discouragement of international arbitra
tion." The New York Press says: "The protest of
the McMurdo heirs and the bondholders, who are the
' real parties in interest, though politics has rather
' obscured them, lies as to loss of time rather than
money. That loss has been such as to constitute a
I powerful argument for a return to the good old plan
with weak powers in debt â of seizing a custom-house.
That is the only way, we fear, inj which we shall ever
extract any redress from the Sultan for similar con
fiscation."
On the other hand there are strong supporters of
the decision. The Boston Herald maintains the award
amply covers the cost of the work done on the road,
I and that the claimants had no right to demand more.
I The Boston Globe declares it to be a "signal triumph
j for arbitration," and predicts it will have a tendency
to promote a resort to arbitration hereafter. The New
York Tribune occupies a middle ground on the issue.
It considers the award to be an outrage on justice,
J but says it is useless to "cuss the court." and argues
j there should be established' a permanent tribunal of
I international arbitration, which would be free- from
the suspicion of acting under political influences. \
It is of course not likely that a miscarriage of jus
tice in a matter of comparatively little importance like

THE PLAGUE SCARE
Riverside Daily Press.
The New York Journal, owned by W. R.
Hearst, also proprietor of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, has broken loose with a
characteristic piece of yellow Journalism
on the outbreak of the plague In San
Francisco. The slender basis of fact for
the great plague number la the death of
a Chinaman in Chinatown, San Francisco.
Some doctors said he died of bubonic
plague, and others said he did not. Cer
tain it Is that no other cases have ap
peared. Deaths have occurred on ship
board In New York harbor from the
plague, and several deaths have occurred
in the quarantine station at Port Town
send. None of these cases, however, stir
red up the Journal, but the moment this
doubtful case appeared in San Francisco,
the yellow sheet startled the country with
the announcement that the plague had In
vaded California.
And the Journal proceeded to serve up
Its news In genuine death's head style.
It embellished Its first page with grue
some cuts, and drew liberally on De Foe's
account of the black plague death in Lon
don. And not satisfied with this, it tele
graphed to the health officers of all the
leading cities of the East to ascertain
what steps they had taken to quarantine
against the plague In California. That
naturally spread the terror, and as a re
sult travel to the State has been checked
and merchants even in far away England
have canceled their wheat orders, lest
grain ships from San Francisco might
carry rats Infected with the plague.
The whole business Is a piece of idiocy,
but, unfortunately for California, as
harmful as If there was really occasion
for It. The man who walks the streets of
San Francisco to-day is as safe from
plague as he Is in New York or Boston,
but after the Journal's scare edition It
will take several months to convince peo
ple that this Is true.

THE KENTUCKY GOVERNORSHIP.
Iâ;I â ; ROM the Court of Appeals of Kentucky there
I was expected hardly any other decision on the
governorship case than that which has been
made. Being composed of Judges a majority of
whom are Democrats, it was a foregone conclusion
the judgment would sustain the Democratic claimant.
The only unexpected feature of the decision is that the
action of the Democratic members of the court was
sustained by two of the Republican members. That
fact saves the decision from the appearance of parti
sanship, and will go far toward obtaining for the
judgment something of public confidence.
It is to be noted the court did not in any way enter
into the merits of the controversy, but contented it
self with declaring it had no power to go behind the
records of the Legislature, which counted out Taylor.
Judge Burnam, whose opinion was sustained by
the majority of the court, says: "I have been led.
with some reluctance, to the conclusionâ and not
without some misgivings as to its correctnessâ that
there is no power in the courts of the State to review
the findings of the General Assembly in a contested
election for the office of Governor and Lieutenant
Governor, as shown by its own authenticated records.
Many questions have been raised and discussed by
counsel for the appellant, but it will be unnecessary to
consider them in view of the conclusion we have
reached on this fundamental question."
The decision is not final, as it has been agreed by
the leaders of both parties that an appeal would be
taken to the Supreme Court of the United States. The
agreement says: "Should any party, after the final
determination of the causes by the Court of Appeals,
desire a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the
United States to review such determination, it is
agreed that such writ shall be immediately applied
for and diligently prosecuted, if secured, and that all
parties to said cause will unite id an application to said
Federal Supreme Court to docket and advance such
causes and give them the earliest hearing and deter
mination possible."
If the Democrats remain true to their promises they
will make no effort to oust Taylor from his office, but
will cordially unite with him in seeking the appeal
agreed upon. It is to be noted, however, that of late
they have shown many signs of a desire to precipitate
matters. Moreover, the efforts made to connect Tay
lor with the alleged conspiracy to assassinate Goebel
show a malicious intent toward him which does not
augur well for the future, though it is hardly likely
any Democratic leader of repute will sanction a direct
attack upon him or his authority.
The venom of the assaults made upon Taylor has
been exposed in the manly letter in which he has pro
tested against the outrage done him. He says: "For
weeks I have been made the target of vilification by
certain unprincipled newspapers in Kentucky. The
vilest insinuations have been made and the most out
rageous falsehoods have been told. When I was
called to attend the funeral of a beloved brother it was
seized upon as an attempt upon my part to fly from
justice. Again, when called to my home by reason of
the death of a dear sister the fountains of abuse were
opened and a flood of falseho.od and slander poured
forth upon me, the, charge again being made that I
was attempting to fly from the State. On my last re
turn to Frankfort these papers hastened to publish
the statement that I was met at the train and escorted
to my home by a squad of soldiers with a Gatling gun.
There is not one word of truth in this statement, but,
nevertheless, it was published and circulated to harm
me."
With that statement Taylor can safely leave his
vindication to the nrinds of his countrymen. It
may be that the United States Supreme Court will,
like the Court of Appeals in Kentucky, hold it cannot
review the findings of the Legislature, and the great
wrong against the voters and the good repute of Ken
tucky will therefore be consummated, but if the peo
ple of that commonwealth be fitted for self-govern
ment such a victory will cost Democracy dear. The
people can always go behind the returns in politics
and do justice, and to them Taylor can safely appeal.
There would be no objection if St., Louis wanted the
whole earth, but her longing to devour the Pacific
Coast as a special tid-bit is grinding.
selecting arbitrators hereafter. If that be accom
plished the Delagoa Bay award will 'have served a
useful purpose, and out of the wrong done to a few
capitalists bring about a surer justice in future.
PROTESTS AGAINST THE PLAYS
BEING GIVEN IN HOLY WEEK
Rev. Charles Adams' Declares the Berkeley Students Should Have
Selected Some Other Week for Their Theatrical Benefit.
? â¢ ,
The Call does not hold Itself responsible for the opinions published In this col
umn, but presents them for whatever value they may have as communications of
general Interest. .
Editor of The Call â Dear Sir: As an American (of several hundred years'
unbroken descent), I have always understood that two principles are thoroughly
established as to public institutions â
1. One is that no such institution shall have any special, sectarian, religious
belief.
2. The second is that no such institution shall adopt measures that insult
the religious belief of any of our citizens.
To the professed (at least) belief of the majority of religious-minded citi
zens next week is Holy Week, devoted to solemn service, penitence and
prayer. Yet it has been selected by a State institution (the University of Cali
fornia, Berkeley) for theatrical performances and joviality. Were this a private
school I would have nothing to say, but I, in my own name and that of many
others who sympathize with me, protest against action which by desecration of
Holy Week by an institution to which all contribute (gladly and proudly), is an
insult to a very considerable number of the taxpayers of the State.
I would have protested some time ago, but was misled into the be
lief that the announced date (April 7) was a misprint for April 17, and I have
waited also for some protest by the Bishops who reside on the bay, and a
great company of priests and ministers who should confront this act by an,in
stitution of State support by some protest, and at last, as an insignificant indi
vidual, I enter my conscientious protest.
A State institution, deriving its support largely from State taxes, has no
right to insult a large portion of its constituents when a week's delay in cer
tain amusements would have harmed nobody.
With this I write to the three Bishops. in San Francisco and several clergy
men, and state openly that if the desecration of Holy Week meets with no op
position the agnostic and rationalist is completely entitled to regard our
professed religion as a sham, and anyone (Christian by profession) who at
tends these entertainments a humbug.
As all I dare to do I dare to do ever my own signature and take the con
sequences. I authorize you to publish my own signature, and am, respect
fully yours, CHARLES F. ADAMS.

LITTLE BOY MAKES
PADEREWSKI WAIT
| /f^UT In his private car at Third and Townsend streets yesterday Pader
| H jj ewski waited for little Valentine Miller, who was to come out and play
Â» % =^' Â»or him. Little Valentine, who is only seven years old, Is blind, talented
and poor, and his parents Journeyed all thÂ«f way from their home In
Â» Ukiah for the sole purpose that the maestro might be Induced to hear the little
â¢ lad and give him a few words of advice. Sam Shortridge, Paderewski's
) friend and legal adviser, arranged for the meeting between the great man
â¢ and the little blind boy.
| On Monday when little Valentine got here he was taken to Paderewskt's
concert. On Monday night the little chap dreamed that he heard the angels
I playing and the music they played was the same as he heard the great man
> Play. j
â¢ - When Shortridge placed little Valentine's case before ' Paderewskl the
> great pianist was Immediately interested. "Blind! poor! talented!" he repeated
â¢ over and over again, and then concluded with a hearty "Certainly I will see
; the boy."
| But fate was against little Valentino and he lost his opportunity. The
. fact that he was to meet and play for the great man excited him. His "highly
I nervous organization suffered and yesterday Paderewskl waited for the slght
â¢ less lad who came not.
â¢ ' "Valentine is ill," his mother afterward explained, "and so he lost his
' opportunity, jHe could not go."

NEW ADVERTISING SCHEME.
Unique and Costly Plan of the Boston
Shoe Company to Catch the
Public Eye.
The Boston Shoe Company, which Is
about to open a big bargain store at 775
Market street, has purchased the entire
stock of the Popular Shoe Store at 40 cents
on the dollar and will have a grand open-
Ing on Wednesday morning, when the
whole lot of boots and shoes will be of
fered to the public at cost. The object of
the BoFton Shoe Company In making this
extraordinarily liberal offer Is for the pur
pose of advertising, pure and simple. It Is
the intention of the new firm to conduct
a bargain store, and this method was de
cided upon as the best and quickest means
of attracting the attention of the public
and building up a business. Selling goods
at cost, allowing nothinsr for wear and
tear and the expense of handling. Is a
rather costly way of advertising, but the
Boston Shoe Company managers have
original Ideas on the subject, and the
public will not be slow In taking advan
tage of the unprecedented opportunity to
secure their footwear at less than half
price. â¢

SOLDIERS AND
POLICE CLASH
AT FRANKFORT
Militiamen Rescue Two of
Their Fellows Who Had
Been Arrested.
FRANKFORT. Ky., April 7.â There is
great excitement here to-night. Two sol
diers at the State House were arrested
by the police for drunkenness while in the
street near the State House. A squad of
twenty-five soldiers dashed out of the
State House yard and rescued their
comrades from the two policemen who
had arrested them. The policemen re
sisted, and during the scuffle a number of
shots were fired, but no one was
wounded.
Chief of Police Williams summoned his
full force and started for the State House
to demand the prisoners, but the Beck
ham military authorities intercepted th<Â»'
police and dissuaded them from attempt
ing to capture the men who had started
the trouble and who had Deen rescued by
their comrades. The soldiers of the op
posing administration were drawn up
ready for action, and trouble was very
narrowly averted.
Chief Justice Hazelrigg of the Court fit

WAGON STRUCK
AND TWO WOMEN
ARE KILLED
An Accident on a Railroad
Crossing Near An
tioch.
ANTIOCH, April 7.â An accident oc
curred at the crossing of the Southern
Pacific Railroad between Antioch and
Cornwall to-day at 4 o'clock. The Los
Angeles express ran -into a buggy occu
pied by Mrs. N. Hill of Cornwall, Mrs.
Holly Ellsworth of Deer Valley and Mrs.
Ellsworth's little girl. Mrs. Ellsworth
was killed Instantly. The train was
stopped and Mrs. Hill and the little girl
taken on board to be carried to where
they could receive medical attention, but
Mrs. Hill died before the train reached
Cornwall. The little girl was taken to
Martinez. She is frightfully bruised about
the bo<ly and head, but hope Is enter
tained for her recovery. The ladles had
been shopping at Antioch and were re
turning home to the Hill ranch.
The accident occurred at a private
crossing on the ranch and one over which
Mrs. Hill had driven many times. ThÂ«
train was late when it arrived at Antloch
and was making up time between here
and Cornwall. A strong wind has been
blowing all the afternoon and dust car
ried by the wind must have blinded the
ladies so that they did not see the train
or else they must have thought there was
no danger because the train should have
passed that crossihg half an hour before.

SOFALA CARRIED
A DECKLOAD OF
WEIGHT AND WON
Tiptoed Her Field From the
Start in the Gebhard
Handicap.
Despite all misgivings of the hoodoo bri
gade Barney Schrelber's sensational two
year-old filly Sofala celebrated his thir
teenth public appearance with the colors
up by capturing the Gebhard handicap at
Oakland yesterday. The event was de
cided over the Futurity course and the
sprightly chestnut MlsÂ» was askefl to pick
up 125 pounds. With a string of ten vic
tories already to her credit she looked a
likely one to cling to, and the big crowd
backed her heavily at odds of 7 to 5. The
Atkins & Lottrldge pair. Diderot tfnd St.
Rica, had second call, with the Burns &
Waterhouse duo. Dunfree and Lucidia.
next in demand.
After a few minutes' delay at the post
the bunch was sent away to a fair start,
the first choice almost immediately taking
command. Dunfree made a pme but
fruitless effort to catch the leader.
Opposite the paddock Henry swished
his whip at Sofala a couple of
times, when she responded gamely, al
though tiring perceptibly, and won by a
couple of lengths. Looking groggy at the
head of the stretch. Dunfree staid with
his work, taking the place from Diderot
by a head. The return of the winner to
the circle in front of the stand was the
occasion for quite an outburst of enthusi
asm, shared also by the PÂ«P ul ar f wn ".
The weather was cool and the track a
trifle slow. Favorites managed to win
three of the purses on the card. There
was no paucity of coin in the ring, and on
one or two events the books received a
severe shaking up. ,
The opening five-furlong scramble re
sulted in a very handy win for Barney
Schreiber's Zurich. Backed, to even
money favoritism, the eeldlne; broke
away first and was n*ver li***.^^. J^noj
landed My Dear second, a neck ahead o*
Parsifal", ridden by Buchanan, and sec
ond choice In the betting, took, the two
yeor-old clash in commanding fashion,
leading from the start. In a. drive Gaylon
Brown downed Aphrodls for the place.
The favorite. Illusion, with Ross up, made
a very poor showing.
Through some musty looking saddle er-
forts Lothian was unable to get away
with the mile and a sixteenth run, played
from 3 to 11 to 5. Shields, astride Scotch
Plaid, considerately finished second, while
the wretchedly handled Jennie Reid ran
third.
An exciting finish marked the close of
the mile free handicap, gathered In by
May W, which led Gauntlet out a nose.
Flush of Gold, coupled with Anjou, ruled
choices in the betting.
After a thorough digest of the starters
in the concluding number the smart ones
chose Headwater for the candidate. He
led from the jump, beating Pompino with
ease. Sly receded from 7 to 5 to 11 to 5,
and 20 to 1 could have been offered with
impunity.
Track Notes.
Headwater, winner of the last event,
was bid up from 1500 to $1500 by Joe Dunn,
owner of Pompino. The stable retained
the sprinter.
After investigating the run of Princes 3
Zeika, which performed badly on Friday,
Owner Grant was exonerated from blame.
Tim Murphy, warned off Oakland track
some weeks ago, was yesterday reinstated
by tho stewards. The suspension was also
lifted from Jockey Morgan.
BERKELEY, April 7.â The baseball
team of the University of Califor
nia defeated Stanford In the first of
the series of intercollegiate games
on the Berkeley campus this afternoon by
a score of 10 to 8. California did not take
its chance at the stick in the ninth inning,
having already lead enough to win the
game.
Fully two thousand people watched the
I game*, which was punctuated with Joshes
I from the two rooting sections. With the
exception of the squally wind the day was
ideal for good ball and the grounds very
fast.
The game on the whole was fairly good,
being sensational at times and exceeding
ly ragged at other times. It was any one's
I game until the ninth Inning. California's
play was ragged- in the first two Innings
and the men seemed to be nervous. After
the third inning California took a brace
and ran in three runs, and in the next
two more, the rest of the innings netting
a run each. Stanford was spasmodic in
its tallying. Lanagan was a disappoint
ment, as the Berkeley men landed on him
freely. He has two men to his credit as
being struck out, as against eight by
Kaarsburg. He had very poor support in
the fields, the infleld, with the exception
of Strohn, being unable to handle the ball
cleanly, and the outfield dropping several
very easy flies.
The score shows California's reputed
heavy-batting team outclassed by Stan
ford by a margin of seven base hits. Cali
fornia's hits, however, were better placed
and made at opportune times. One of the
features of the game was a one-handed
catch by Edwards at short, who took a
high liner over second from Fuller. The
base stealing of both teams was weak,
though California took more chances and
netted three to Stanford's none. The only
accident of the game occurred to
Lougheed running to second base. Kaars
burg threw to second, the ball hitting
Lougheed on the side of the head, inca
pacitating him for several minutes.
The detailed score was as follows:

STANFORD MEETS DEFEAT

STOCKTON WINS
A CLOSE GAME
FROM OAKLAND
Sharp Fielding and Few

Both Pitchers Do Good Work In the
Box and Their Support
Was of Excellent
Quality.
Stockton 2, Oakland 1.
~Â£Â» few Epectators who occupied the
bleachers at the baseball game yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Pork saw one of
those matches that keep the tonprues of
the fans wagging: in post mortems. The
men from the asylum town turned the
trick and the Dudes went home sadder
but wiser men.
Stockton now leads the league with a
team that is well balanced. Several times
during the game the result was in doubt
and this heightened the interest to an ex
citing degree, although no deaths occur
red from lack of heart action. Whalen
pitched good ball, as did Steffani. The
errors were not very numerous, but what
there were of them were costly.
The last half of the second inning
brought the nrst rapid heart-beat. The
bags were filled by the Brummels, Hardle
on third. Dur.leavy on second and Moski
man on first. "Oom Paul" Lange thought
for a moment that he would put the ball
over the fence. This was simply a mental
aberration. He died on an in-field fly,
making the second corpse. Steffani, who
followed, was easy, cutting the atmos
jjhore three times in succession.
Tlw lir^t run of the game was. scored in
the fourth. With two epitaphs inscribed,
J^ockhead was presented with a base for
jlaving a flesh target and went to third
Â«>n Babbit's hit to left. Then talkative
Moore came to the bat and put the ball so
fiercely at Steffani that the latter did a
specialty jugglery act and Lockhead
scored.
In the fifth inning the Dudes shed their
dress clothes and tied the score. Schmeer
rapped out a single, skirting the bags on
a rich double to far center from Hutch-
Insbn's bat. Hardie went to the initial
station on four bad ones, but a double
play that followed sent the Dudes to the
IUMd with but a single run to their credit.
The score did not remain a tie very long.
A couple of errors, one by Pop Hardie.
who dropped Pace's fly, and the other by
J^anee. who failed to stop a hit by Babbitt,
were instrumental in sending. Pace over
the rubber.
There was a bit of torrid playing in the
last of the seventh. Steffani and Schmeer
were holding down second and third with
the graveyard empty. Hammond flew to
Morrow .-md then Hutchinson. the heavy
t^ick wifl<3er. came to the plate. He
drove a fast one to Babbitt, who returned
th<* ba'.l t<< the plate, shutting out Steffani.
gchaaeer was caught napping at third and
the si<ie retired, the score remaining un
touched. The score is:

SAN FRANCISCO WINS.
FAN FRANCISCO, April 7.â Considered
fr^m a scientific standpoint, the article of
hasrbaU furnlFhod by the Sacramento and
Ban Francisco teams to-day was not a
rearing fuoccrs. It was a comedy of er
rors, played by expert comedians, and
while there was some hard slogging and
pood work on the bases the game was
about as rooky a a any ever played on the
local diamond. T'mpire McDonald added
to the gloom. He was a dismal failure.

DECLINED TO
RESPOND TO A
CALL FOR HELP
Criminal Carelessness of
the Attaches of the
Hospital.
?
Romeo Ainsworth Compelled to Suf-
f er for Two Hours Before the Am
bulance Arrived â Investi
gation to Be Held.
? _
The action of the attaches of the Re
ceiving Hospital in refusing to respond
to an emergency call sent in by the officer
In charge of the Southern police station
will in all probability be investigated by
the Board of Health.
Shortly after midnight yesterday morn-
Ing word was received at the Southern
Elation that a man was dying at Sixth and
Townsend streets. Acting Clerk Murphy,
who received the message, immediately
telephoned to the Receiving Hospital with
instructions to get the ambulance there
as soon as possible. About a half hour
later another telephone message was re
ceived, asking about the delay in the ar
rival of the ambulance. Murphy again
telephoned to the hospital and was In
formed that the ambulance was on its
way to the scene.
Suspecting something wrong, Lieutenant
Mooney left his post and, going to the
hospital, met the ambulance as It was
leaving. This was three-quarters of an
hour after the first telephone message had
been received. When called to an ac
count the steward at the hospital said
that he was busy and could not get the
ambulance out any sooner. After almost
two hours' delay the ambulance finally
returned to the hospital with the supposed
dying man. He proved to be Romeo Ains
worth, who had charge of a carload of
chickens which were en routÂ© East.
Ainsworth after reaching this city be
came ill and eeemed to be In a dying con
dition. He was taken from the car and
the yardmaster Instructed to telephone to
the police. For nearly two hours he was
forced to remain in an unused shed of the
railroad company while the police were
vainly endeavoring to induce the doctor
In charge of the hospital to send for him.
When the ambulance finally arrived Ains
worth was in a very serious condition and
begged to be taken to the Receiving Hos
pital. After reaching there It was neces
pary to awaken the doctor on duty, as he
had fallen asleep while waiting for the
ambulance to return.
An examination disclosed that Ains
worth was suffering from Intestinal colic
In an aggravated form. After the usual
remedies were administered he was put to
bed. It is not the fault of the hospital
attaches that Ainsworth did not die be
fore he reached that institution. For
nearly two hours he lay contiguous to the
railroad track, suffering untold agonies
and praying for medical relief. Still no
ambular.ee. came.
Captain Spillane, who is familiar with
the notoriously incompetent methods of
the Receiving Hospital staff, is determined
to bring the matter to the attention of the
Board of Health. He has already pre
ferred cltarges against Steward Bertand,
who neglected to send the ambulance
when he called for it, and expects that he
will be summarily dismissed from the de
partment.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 8, 1900.
HARES RUN WILD
IN A HIGH WIND
AT UNION PARK
Many Undecided Courses
Owing to Adverse Con
ditions on Field.
Beacon Is Again Installed Favorite
for the Stake, With Palo Alto
and Ireland Also Highly
Fancied.
Coursing at Union Park yesterday "was |
conducted under difficulty. A strong north !
wind swept the field throughout the after
noon, filling the atmosphere with sand
and disconcerting the hares. At best they
were of poor quality and afforded but .
short runs In the majority of instances, j
Once they felt the full sweep of the wind
they usually turned to the right and fa
vored the dog on the white flag. Of the
forty-two courses the dog on the white
won twenty-five.
The favorites won in the majority of |
courses. Red Hind beat Daisy Maid, the
2 to 1 favorite. Joe Farrell and Recording
Angel ran three times before the latter !
finally won. The first time Recording An
gel was alO to 1 favorite. Joe Farrell ran ,
unsighted. The next time out Recording
Angel was favorite at 15 to 1. This time .
Joe Farrell led to the hare and the course
resulted in an "undecided." At the third
attempt the Angel was at even money
and won. _ . _ â¢
Shylock Boy beat Aeneas at 5 to 3, San
tonin beat Singleton at 2 to 1 and Hadi
wlst beat Miss Grizzle at 3 to 1 after two
J. L,. Ross' Just Tip furnished some |
amusement early in the afternoon. He i
was being taken off the field, after hay- |
Ing been beaten by Sir Pasha, when he
saw a hare. He broke away from his j
handler and, with blanket on, coursed the
hare all over tue field. He captured it at i
the escape and Immediately started up an- |
other hare. Retaining his first capture in j
his mouth, he started after the other hare
and coursed that. When he was within ;
striking distance of the second hare he
dropped his first capture and then caught
the second one. He was too tired told ,
the first hare and when he released It it .
made its escape. I
Beacon has been Installed a strong ra- ;
vorlte for the stake. Next in demand is ;
Palo Alto. The latter meets Master Clalr .
in his first course, and if he passes that ,
point is expected ' to run well into the j
stake. He showed great speed with Cymro
and dashed in for the kill without his us- i
ual hesitation, winning by a score of 6

pleasure that I am almost completely cured. When I commenced taking Electrozone my hands and limbs
were swollen in a terrjble manner. I was unable to open or dosa my hands, to walk, sit down or get up
without assistance. During the last ten years I have spent over one thousand dollars ($1000) In trying
doctors and various medicines for relief, but with no permanent results. After taking two bottles of
Electrozone began to Improve, and now after the fourth note that my stomach Is in better condition than
for many years. The swelling and pain have entirely disappeared from my hands and limbs. Can walk
about without assistance' of, any nature, and know I shall soon be as well as I ever was. Am now in
my sixtieth year, thirty-six. of which have been an Odd Fellow on this coast, bein? a charter member of

ACTION IN THE
MARCEAU CASE
Order of Court Summons
All Parties to San

Special Dispatch to Ths CalL
- LOS ANGELES. April 7.â Although the
hearing of the habeas corpus proceedings
Instituted by Mrs. Amanda J. Fiske-Mar
ceau-Fennell, for the recovery of her s
year-old eon Theodore from the custody
of Colonel Marceau, is set for Monday
morning at 10 o'clock, in Judge York's
court, the fact has developed that through
her attorneys, who are in San Francisco,
this case may be reset by consent.
Mrs. Fennell has been informed that
an order of court has been obtained which
demands the presence of young Theo in
San Francisco next Monday morning,
carrying the entire case to an initial pro
ceeding to determine, as the parents can
not agree who shall possess the child, who
shall become his custodian. Mrs. Fen
nell is preparing to go to San Francisco
on the Owl train to-morrow night, and
as Colonel Marceau, through the opera
tion of the writ that took the child from
its mother at Bakersfleld, has the child,
he also will, it is understood, accompany
his bo/ to the north on the same train.
Mrs. Fennell has not seen her boy since
the colonel marched out of the court
room, leading young Theo by the hand.
Marceau's attorneys Informed the mother,
in the most frigid note that words could
frame, that she could Bee him if they
were notified by a given hour to allow
preparation for the event. Mrs. Fennell
Is prostrated by grief and a cold that
threatens serious complications. She Is
under a physician's care and needs the
best attention. Her mental distress is
more pitiable than la her physical condi
tion. : .. A
"You may declare twthe world that no
friends of mine and that none of my at
torneys have sued for a truce." she said
to-night, "and that the statements that
mutual friends are endeavoring to bring
about a reconciliation is only a ruse. As
a finale to It all, I will say that while I
love my boy, I would rather let a third
party take charge of him than again
marry Colonel Marceau to have him re
stored to me."
Former United States Senator White
was In consultation with Mrs. Fennell

She Swears to Facts,
I have feared paralysis; I would feel
nervous, dizzy, have headache and a numb
feeling all over me; and at times be com-
pletely prostrated. I tried medicine and
doctors, but found little relief until I was
advised to try Electrozone. Before I fin-
ished the first bottle I felt a great im-
firovement, and continued until now I am
n perfect health. In all I have used three
bottles. I write this for the benefit of any
woman who suffers with such ailments
peculiar to our sex. I would not bÂ« with
out this medicine. Yours respectfully,

life anew and make the parlor what it
was in the days of its prosperity. Three

plications were received. The parlor will

CRAB FISHERMAN.
DROWNED BEFORE

Knocked Overboard by the
Boom and Sank Before

Â¦ Â»
The circumstances surrounding the
drowning of an Italian fisherman yester
day morning were tragic in the extreme.
The unfortunate fellow was engaged in
"crabbing" off the end of the sea wall and
his wife and child watched their bread
winner at work with his nets from section
1 of the sea wall. Just as the fisherman
cast a net Into the water a squall struck
the boat, the sail filled and, throwing the
boom over, it caught the man In the small
of the back and knocked him overboard.
The gust of wind carried the boat away
quite a distance, and when the fisherman
came to the surface he seemed unable to
do anything save keep afloat and yell for
help. The distracted wife laid her child
down among the grain eacks and,-arous
ing the people on the schooner Josie, got
them to go to the drowning man's as
sistance. A small boat was quickly man
ned and a gasoline crabboat that was
coming In also started to the rescue. Just
as they were preparing to grasp the ua
fortunate fellow he threw up his arms
and went down like a stone. The boats
waited around for half an hour, but he
did not come up again. His boat was
then taken to Fishermen's wharf, while
the wife was attended to by some by
standers who took her. and. the child to
her home on Union street.
The ' fisherman's name was Jack Ma
cardo and his boat was called the.Con
cordla. He had been crab fishing along
the sea wall and around Black Point for
years and never met with an accident
before. Yesterday Instead of using the
oars he was sailing from net to net and
in an unguarded moment the accident
happened.
FROM SEA
AND SHORE
fâ ir-iWO mor- vessels were added to the
quarantined fleet yesterday. They
jl were the schooner Helen N. Kimball,
17 days from Haua, and the bark Ed
ward May, 19 days from Makaweli. The
Moana was released yesterday afternoon
and docked at Pacific street. The Doric's
passengers came over yesterday morning
and the chances are the vessel will be
released to-day, while the transport Sher
idan will be released to-morrow. The
agents for the Doric are very anxious to
have the vessel released, as she has
on board thirty-flve boxes of gold valued
at over $1,000,000.
Shipyards Are Busy.
Another fine four-masted schooner for
the Philippine trade will be launched
from Hay & Wright's yards at Alameda
next Saturday. This makes the third,
and as soon as she is afloat the keel of a
fourth will be laid. The first schooner,
the Philippine, is now on her way home
from Manila; the second one. Expansion,
is now on her way to San Pedro, while
the third, Luzon, will go to Manila as
soon as she is equipped. The one yet to
be built has not been named, but she will
probably be called Mindora and will take
1,000.000 feet of lumber to the Philippines
for Uncle Sam.
Hay & Wright are also building very
substantial deckhouses on the Alaska
Packers' Association's steamer Wigwam,
also putting deckhouses on the Francis
Cutting for Hume Brosjv putting another
deck on the Dora for the Alaska Com
mercial Company, while they have the
steamer Celia on the marine ways giving
her. a thorough overhauling.
The steamer Coquille River reports

Sierra Pedrosa in a Gale.
The British ship Sierra Pedrosa arrived
from Antwerp yesterday after a run of
144 days. The voyage was uneventful up
to April 3, when the vessel was 200 miles
off the coast. What Captain Starkey de
scribes as a blizzard then struck her and
she had a hard time. The sleet was al
most blinding and a very heavy sea was
running. After escaping the blizzard the
Sierra Pedrosa ran into the fog and was
delayed twenty-four hours thereby.
Ferry Steamer Remodeled.
The ferry steamer James M. Donohue
has been thoroughly overhauled and made
into one of the handsomest boats on the
bay. Over $10,000 has been expended In
putting in new cabins and installing an
electric light plant, while the hull and
machinery have been thoroughly over
hauled. When the Donohue is ready for
service she will take the place of the
Tiburon for a week while that vessel Is
being overhauled. After that the Dono
hue will be used as an excursion boat.
The tugs Fearless and Alert brought the
Badger down from Mare Island yesterday
afternoon. She has been transferred from
the navy to the v army transport service
and will carry soldiers and supplies to
Nome for a few months. After that the
chances are that she will be turned into
a hospital fehip, replacing the Missouri,
which will be turned into a freight boat.
The steamer China sailed for the Orient
yesterday with a large cargo and quite a
number of passengers.

A Coroner's Jury yesterday Investigated
the death of John Flanagan, the young
plumber who died at the City Receiving
Hospital last Friday morning of a frac
tured skull, and returned a verdict of ac
cidental death.
The evidence was that at 1:30 o'clock on
the same morning Flanagan and a com
panion named Bradley created a disturb
ance in-Harry Bentham's saloon on Valen
cia street, near Sixteenth, and were gen
tly pushed out of the door by P. Higgins,
the barkeeper. Flanagan stumbled .down
the step that led to the sidewalk and fell
on his back on the cement walk .with
Bradley on top. both being drunk. The
fall fractured Flanagan's skull.

THE FEAR OF HUMBUG.
Prevents Many People From Trying
a Good Medicine.
Stomach troubles are so common and in
most cases so obstinate to cure that' peo-
ple are apt to look with suspicion on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness in never being humbugged, es-
pecially in medicines.
Tnis fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far; so far, in fact, that man>
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets. ! :<'";i
Now Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different In one Important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines for
the reason that they are not afsecret pat-
ent medicine. No secret is made of their
ingredients, but analysis shows ~them to
contain the natural digestive ferments,
pure aseptic pepsin, the dig'estivo acids,
Golden Seal, bismuth, hydrastis and nux.
They are not cathartic, neither; do they
act powerfully on any organ, but they
cure , indigestion on the common smise
plan of digesting the food eaten thor-
oughly before it has time to ferment, sour
and cause the mischief. This is the only
secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never can
cure Indigestion and stomach troubles be-
cause they act entirely on the bowels,
whereas the whole trouble is really In the
stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets . taken after

Rearranging Police Districts.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs has been for some time urging the
advisability of rearranging the bounda
ries of the various police districts and
President A. S. Llllie has addressed a
communication on the subject to the
Board of Police Commissioners, In which
he states that such action would prove a
benefit to the department and afford bet
ter protection to the citizens. He urges
that the police stations should be placed
as near as possible in the center of their
respective districts, as at present they
are as a rule not conveniently located.-
Huntington's Generous Gift.
The visitors at the Mark Hopkins Insti
tute of Art on Friday had an unexpected
pleasure in seeing two pictures which
have just been brought from the East by
Collls P. Huntington and presented to the
art association. One of them is a still life
by 'William Harnett, a marvelous piece of
work in its attention to detail and yet
with an atmospheric effect that makes
each object seem absolutely real. The
other is a rich summer landscape by
Julian Rix, one of the latest and best
pieces of work by this well known painter.
The Harnett is from Mr. Huntington's
New York gallery, while the Rix was pur
chased by him especially for. the art insti
tute. That the public appreciated the op
portunity of being given the first chance
to see these admirable works was evi
denced by the crowds that surrounded
them all day.

RESORTS PREPARING
For Big Business This Summer.
Conditions were never more favorable
for a large summer travel in California
than at present, and anticipating that
result, both the summer resorts and trans
portation companies aro making big prep
arations. The resorts are enlarging and
Improving their facilities for entertain
ment, and the railroads are improving
conveniences for travel and establishing
lower excursion rates. The tendency to
reduction of rates, not only in travel but
in the cost of outings, is marked in all
directions. 'Â¦
As aids to outings, the value of which
can hardly be estimated, the Southern Pa
cific has published an elaborate series of
pretty folders and pamphlets which de
scribe and illustrate almost every place
of note in the State and fully explain the
ways and means of a visit. They can be
had upon application to any Southern
Pacific agent, or if asked for by mail by
enclosing a stamp for each publication.
Among the more valuable are "Resorts
and Attractions on the Coast Line,"
"Shasta Resorts," "Lake Tahoe," "Yo
semite," "Geysers and Lake County,"
"Summer Outings." "Pacific Grove" and a
large, handsome folder map of California,

REAL ESTATE IS QUIET.
THERE has been comparatively lit
tle doing irt real estate circles dur
ing the past week, although the
general tone of the market is
healthy and entirely satisfactory to
brokers and owners of property. The de
mand for good investment properties con
tinues brisk, but holders have as a rule
fixed prices rather above what prospective
purchasers are willing to pay. Differences
of this nature, however, will naturally
adjust themselves. Referring to the pres
ent condition of the market Thomas Ma
gee & Son's Real Estate Circular in its
issue of April 1 says:
"Business property, and business prop
erty only, is in demand. Retail property
is preferred, although there is inquiry also
for wholesale property. Buyers for this
latter class of property want It below
Market street. Retail' property which Is
not now but will within ten years be in
cluded in the retail circle of city trade
can now be sold at fair prices. There is
also a special demand on the part ofÂ»a
few warehouse and factory people for
land which they wish to improve by
Brannan and Townsend streets facing on
or near the railroad tracks. Houses and
lots of the value of $4000 to $6000 are in fair
demand. No dwelling land anywhere but
on the best portion of Pacific Heights is
Increasing in value. No third or fourth
class business property is increasing in
price, though It is renting better than
it did two or three years ago. Rents gen
erally are better than they were then;
and they would need to be; there were
more- vacancies then perhaps than at al
most any other dull spell in the history
of the city. The total number of sales in
March was 319, of the aggregate value or
$1,031,992."
On the same subject the Buyer and
Seller, published by Baldwin & Howell,
has the following:
"No material change has taken place In
the real estate market during the past
thirty days. A good demand still exists
for first class retail business property and
for the best residence sites. Investors
have not been frightened by the bubonic
scarecrow because they realized that it is
a mixture of indiscretion, politics and per
sonalities. Property owners know to err
is human, but they are not so saturated
with forgiveness that they will forever
pardon the mistakes of officials or ignore
the assaults upon the city by home or for
eign journals. The investment of outside
capital has always had a most stinAilat
ing effect upon the real estate market,
and it should be the aim of the press and
also the city officers to protect and pre
serve the good name of San Francisco
without regard to personal interest or po
litical results. While it Is true, as already
stated, real estate values may not have
been immediately affected by the bubonic
controversy commerce has received a
stunning blow which has wrought an In-
Jury that may be more far reaching than
we realize at present."
Concerning the condition of the local
money market Magee's Circular says:
"Money remains at 6 per cent, the banks
paying tho mortgage tax, with little de
mand. The total number of city real es
tate mortgages recorded in March was
400, of the value of $1,330,749. There were
323 mortgages released, amounting In all
to $1,091,037. The price of money tends
downward. During the past month 151
mortgages were taken by private persons,
amounting to $336,224; they released $457,
292. The Hibernia Bank lent $398,375 and
released $281,085. The German Bank lent
$216,350 and released $163,660. The Savings
Union lent $53,550 in March and released
$67,050. More borrowers now, as for the
past two years, is a crying need with our
savings banks."
The same publication also has the fol
lowing comment on the significance of
the Risdon Iron Works recent purchase,
news of which was first published ex
clusively in the Call :
"For over fifteen years the Risdon Iron
Works have been contemplating the pur
chase of a large tract of land on the bay.
and the enlargement of their plant and
the addition thereto of a drydock for the
largest vessels 1 and a shipyard in which
all classes of iron and steel craft could be
built. This purchase they have finally
made by the acquisition of the old rolling
mills' site at the Potrero,- at a reported
price of $550,000. Those mills began clos
ing but. their business about two years
ago. .There are thirty-two acres of land
in the Risdon purchase, and a deep water
front of over 1500 feet. The Union Iron
Works will now have a competitor in the
building of vessels here, and thus prices
will be lowered. A very large addition
to the hands employed by the Risdon
Works will now result. Cities are built
0/1 permanent and prosperous foundations
only, when home manufactories increase
and prosper.* Had the Union Iron Works
not been doing well, and the Risdon also,
the latter would not have made this
large purchase and enlargement. The roll
ing mills would not have gone out of ex
istence had the stockholders enlarged and
improved its plant, to keep it up with
modern Eastern establishments. An
enormous Increase in the capital would
have been required to do this, and as as
sessments under poor management in
stead of dividends had long been the rule,
the increased capital was not forthcoming
and the establishment was closed. The
Risdon will make a good phenix, from
the long cold ashes of the rolling mills."

22STATE CLUBS TO
BE REPRESENTED
AT LOS ANGELES
Conference of San Francisco
and Alameda County
Delegation.
Reports Presented From Various Or
ganizations Foreshadow Large
Attendance From This
City.
Â«
In response to an Invitation from Colo
nel George Stone, pr6sldent of the Califor
nia Republican League, a number of club
officers assembled for conference at the
Union League Club last evening. Colonel
Stone announced that the object of the
meeting was to exchange views regarding
the Los Angeles convention and to ascer
tain how large an attendance there would
be from San Francisco and Alameda coun
ties. He fancied that even a lower rate
than $20 for the round trip might be ob
tained if one hundred delegates would act
together and charter a train.
Henry C. Barrow, president of the
Berkeley Republican Club, said that the
organization which he represented was
entitled to fifteen delegates, and he was
positive that five would attend the con
vention.
A. G. Booth, president of the Union
League Club, remarked that the league
was entitled to fourteen delegates aside
from its officers, and he was convinced
that eight representatives would be pres
ent. to say nothing of proxy representa
tion.
Colonel William Macdonald, president
of the National league Club, gave assur
ance that hiÂ« club would send a delega
tion. He said that he would be in Los
Angelos and attend the convention.
Colonel Whitesides said tho McKlnley
Sailors' and Soldiers' Republican Club
would *be represented.
Hamilton J. Riggins of the Continental
league announced that the executive
committee would meet next Tuesday anil
elect ' delegates. He asserted that tho
league was entitled to seventy-one dele
gates. He believed that fifty, including
twenty Knights Tomplar. would speak for
the league at Los Angeles.
Thomas W. Northup, president of the
Bear Club, said that organization was en
titled to fourteen representatives and that
seven would go.
E. M. Galvin announced that he would
attend the convention as a delegate from
the Garlield League. Oscar Tolle of the
German-Americnn Club and Alpheus Duf
fee of the Thirty-sixth Assembly District
Club gave notice that each club would be
represented. â¢
Major Kyle s-aid he was not authorized
to speak officially for the Phoenix Club,
which' was entitled to twenty-five dele
gates, but he hud knowledge that fifteen
members Qf the club Intended to visit Los
Angeles and participate in the work of the
convention.
Dr. Morris, representing the Forty-third
Assembly District Club, said the club
would send five delegates.
H. Z. Osborne of Loa Angeles, chairman
of the transportation committee, assured
the meeting that the delegates attending
would have a delightful time, as special
plans of entertainment had been devised.
Colonel George Stone observed that it
inspired one with enthusiasm to see how
the leading men of Los Angeles are work
ing to promote the success of the conven-
Thomas D. Rlordan suggested that an
other meeting be held next Saturday. The
suggestion was adopted after prolonged
discussion. It was the sense of the con
ference that the presidents and secretaries
of San Francisco and Alameda County
clubs should attend the meeting next
Saturday evening and definitely report the
number of delegates elected and also the
number that would surely go to Los An-

was requested to <?onfer with the South

might not be secured.
Prohibition Party.
The Prohibitionists of Northern Califor
nia will hold a convention next Thursday,
April 12. in Hamilton Hall. Oakland, - for
the purpose of electing delegates to the
national convention,- to be held in Chicago
June 27. .
THE body of the elderly man found
in the water off West Berkeley last
Sunday has been identilled as that
of F. W. Kreling, a pioneer of this
city, formerly of the firm of F. W.
Kreling & Sons, and fathor-in-law of Mrs.
Ernestine Krelins of the Tivoll Opera
house and Mrs. John Kreling, housekeeper
at the Baldwin Annex. Yesterday after
noon Deputy Coroner Streightiff came to
San Francisco and his description of the
body satisfied the latter Mrs. Kreling that
the remains were those of her father-in
law. She also identified a* boot taken from
the body as that of her missing relative.
The boot bore the maker's mark of H.
Frese. 327 Grant avenue, San Francisco.
Mrs. Kreling declared that her father
in-law must have met a violent death.
She said he had taken breakfast as usual
with her last Saturday morning and had
been in his usual cheerful spirits. She
was positive that he had not committed
suicide, because he had told her only a
few days before his disappearance that he
was making preparations to go East to
sell some property he owned in New York.
He had purchased his ticket and was to
leave in a few days.
"Mrs. Kreling was positive that the de
scription was that of her father-in-law,"
said Deputy Coroner Streightiff. "and it
was settled by the boot. I traced the name
through the bootmaker and a tag found
pewed on deceased's clothing that gave
the name of Krelins."
Carl Kreling. a nephew of F. W. Krel
ing. and W. H. Leahy, manager of the
Tivoll, were notified of the finding of the
body and went to Oakland last night to
investigate. They positively identified the
body as that of F. W. Kreling. After
viewing the remains, the nephew said:
"I am convinced my uncle met foul
treatment. When ho left the Baldwin An
mx last Saturday morning he had his
gold watch, valuable papers and consid
erable money with him, as he was get
ting ready to go East. The police will
be asked to make a thorough investiga
tion."
Neither Kreling nor Leahy are able to
assign any reason why deceased should
commit suicide. A pocket handkerchief.
30 cents and a partially tilled whisky flask"
were found on the body.
Deceased was about SO years old. How
he met his death is a deep mystery. The
body had been In the water apparently
not more than twenty-four hours and
was only slightly mutilated by the action
of the Â¦water. There was no evidence of
violence and nothing to indicate that mur
der had been committed.
Dtpuly Coroner Streightiff of Berkeley
has under investigation a report that a
, launch was teen off West Berkeley a
week ago Saturday flying signals of dis
tress, with two men in It. He believes
Kreling may have been one of the men
and that the craft was capsized. The
body was found in shallow water and it
was washed ashore by the high tide and
heavy wind of last Sunday.
On the same day that Mr. Kreling dis
appeared John Uhlberg, a journeyman
tailor living at SS Third street, also disap
peared. Uhlberg's body was found that
night on the Berkeley shore about half a
mile below the place where Krellng's
body was discovered the next day. The
body was identified a few days later.
Uhlberg was a Swede, and as Kreling
spoke Swedish it is possible that tiie two Â¦
met and started out together for a sail on I
the bay and met death together, although j
under just what circumstances may never
be known. Uhlberg had been in San I
Francisco but a fow days before his death, I
having come to this city from Seattle.

of Inebriety and demanded liquor, which
was refused. During the mix-up that fol

Ernest P. Graves, the well known law
yer, of San Luis Obispo, who was sen

Sudden Death of H. W. Stokes.
H. W. Stokes, an employe of the Mar
ket-street Railway Company, died sudden
ly yesterday morning while working In
the Hayes-street car. house, evidently
from heart failure. The deceased was a
native of New York City. 66 years old, and
resided with his family at 422 Lyon street.

17 j? ALI ADALI. blessed with great strength and a still greater appetite, is
[ i taring at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. With him is his manager, Duncan
S ii ' â¢ McMUlen. who is also a noted athlete, and between the two the
taMe in the dining-room at meal times takes on the appearance of a
Kansas town aftf>r a cyclone has passed ovr-r it. Both men must eat to sus
tain themselves in th'-ir contests, but judging by the amount of food they can
store away they are in fit condition to give battle to a score of men.
Hall Adali is called the "Sultan's Lion." but it is not his roar that frightens
his opponents; It JÂ«= his great size and enormous strength. His muscles do not
Â¦bulge out like balloons, but are elastic, and when brought Into play are capable
of lifting and throwing camel? and even breaking human backs. . Heenjoyr the
distinction of once having thrown Yqusouf, the "Terrible Turk." whose remains
are at the bottom of the Atlantic, ocean. As Is well remembered Yousouf was
no "Turk" when It came to wrestling, he having defeated the best men In the
land before he met his fate on the ocean, and if Adall defeated him he Is well
Â«lÂ«le to defend the honors bestowed on him by his Sultan. George Mlehllng,
strong man and wrestling instructor of the Olympic Club, is willing to attest
to th.Â» prowess of the "lion." On Monday night Adali buffeted Mlehling around
the mat at the Olympic Club as if he were a mere automaton. With a shrug
of his big shoulder the Turk sent Mlohling at least ten feet, and with a series
of holds new to local wrestlern. which are termed "bear" and "jail" holds,
he made Lh< German look like a "sellir.g-plater."
The Turkish athlete is a giant In klzc, being six feet In height and weighing
225 pounds. His strength is enormous and his skill is proportionate. He came
to America for glory and shekels and is earning both. He has a large capital
â¢nd 15 ready to back himself for 11000 a Fide to meet any wrestler who may
l>e matchÂ«>d against him. In. addition to his \-ictory over the "Terrible Turk"
A<Jaii announcfF that he defeated Panali. z. giart of the Sultan's house guards.

Armenian strong nan and wrestler.

was hurried to the City Receiving Hospi
tal, where his wound was dressed. Can
trowlth has been afflicted with' asthma for
a long time, and has often threatened to
commit suicide. His recovery Is doubtful.

only dramatic but thrillingly so. Mr. and
Mrs. Katz arrived from Sacramento re
cently. A few days ago they engaged the
Sutter-street Hat and Friday afternoon it
was ready for ocdupancy. That night for
the iirst time Mr. and Mrs. Katz remained
in the house; Yesterday morning about 5
o'clock Mr. Katz was awakened by a
strange noise. Looking up, he saw a
shadow moving about the room, and In
stinctively thought of burglars. He leaped
out of bed and in an Instant was rolling
over the floor in desperate battle with the
burglar. Mrs. Katz was awakened by the
racket and without hesitation she ran to
the kitchen and procured a butcher-knife.
Hurrying back, she called to her husband,
and In the dim light located him and
handed him Â»he weapon.
The burglar closed In again and al
though Katz tried to stab him. the thief
was too expert In self-defense. Finally
the knife was wrenched from Katz's
hand and with a few quick lunges the bur
glar cut several gashes in his opponent's
hands and then fled.
Although bleeding profusely. Katz made
an investigation of the premises and
found that the burglar had entered his
dwelling through the back door. Much
valuable plate, jewelry and bric-a-brac
was found in the back yard, where it had
been carried by the thief. Katz bound his
wounds, carried his property back into the
house and with his wife went In search of
â¢i physician. After the Injuries were
dressed Katz reported the case to the
police, who are now working on the same.
Last night Mrs. Katz decided that she
would not Htay in the house, and husband
and wife remained with friends over
night.
' Katz can give but a poor description of
his assailant, and notwithstanding his
wife's courage and coolness it. was too
dark for her to gather an idea of his
appearance. This being the fact. It Is
not probable that he will be captured. -

BRYAN PAUSES TO
GREET THE BRAVES
In His Flight From the Sound to the
Fresno Plains He Salutes the Iro
quois, but Declines to Speak of
Dewey or Miles.
W. J. BRYAN BEING RECEIVED BY THE IROQUOIS.
WILLIAM J. BRYAN spent half an
hour in San Francisco yesterday.
The Democratic campaigner stop
Â¦ ped while en route on his South
ern California tour to receive greetings
from the Iroquois Club at the Palace Ho
tel and to shake hands with some of the
Democratic leaders in these parts.
Mr. Bryan explained that his itinerary
was to Include only such places as he had
been unable to visit during his trip of
last fall. Therefore this city was omitted
so far as anything more than an informal
welcome was concerned.
He eschewed discussion of personal poll
tics, declining forcefully to express any
opinion of the candidacy for the Presi
dency of himself. Admiral Dewey, General
Miles or any one else.
Bryan arrived at 7:30 o'clock yesterday
morning on the Portland express, being
met at Sixteenth street. Oakland, by Na
tional Democratic Committeeman J. J.
Dwyer, Registrar Thomas J. Walsh, Jo
seph Leggett and James H. Barry. At
Oakland pier Seth Mann, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee;
Jasper McDonald, chairman of the Demo
cratic County Central Committee: James
G. Magulre, Sidney Van Wyck. W. H. Al
ford, A. B. Bennison of Oakland and oth
ers joined the party. Mr. Bryan was es
corted from Sacramento by a committee
of Democrats from Fresno, his first stop
ping place after leaving here. Among
them were Mark R. Plaisted, E. C. Wil
liams, chairman of the Democratic Coun
ty Committee; ex-Supervisor Butler and
Deputy District Attorney Church.
During the trip across the bay Mr.
Bryan was in the hands of the Inter
viewers. Voluble enough on topics of im
personal relation to current political af
fairs, the Democratic orator had but one
reply to queries upon the various, candi
date's. , iVJi^-r^;
"What have you to say about Admiral
Dewey' a candidacy?" Mr. Bryan was
a '"Not a word." was the sentient reply.
"And General Miles'?*"
"The same answer.
Â¦ "And your own candidacy? ',*"Â¦Â»
"I decline to discuss that subject or any
other bearing upon personal relations to
the coming campaign." â¢
"Will you make an official announce
ment now concerning your candidacy?"
"No- I am willing to talk about the
issues of the year from the present out
look, but nothing further. The three im
portant ones are the money question, em
bracing both .the standard and paper
money; the trusts, and the question of im
perialism, embracing the size of our mlli
tarv establishment. .
"Men differ concerning the relative Im
portance of these questions. I will not
discuss that aspect. The Republican
party is wrong on all of them.
"The money question I" always import
ant and will continue to be until It is set-
tied In the Interests of the people and not
fc-r the money-changers. The new cur
rency bill is simply a step toward a gold
standard. It doe* not destroy the legal
tender qualities of the silver dollar be
cause the Republican party Is afraid at
this time to expose Its -whole plan. The
bill Intends to make gold. the. only stand
ard and to make bank notes the only
paper money. The currency measure or
financial bill means a perpetual and an
increasing public debt. You cannot have
an Increasing currency on the basis of
that bill without increasing the- debt.
Debt increases in a ratio as to circula
tion.
"In' order to have a basis upon which
bonds may issue financiers are In favor
of the, bill.
"Congress has done nothing toward-pro
tection of the people against trusts, and I
do not believe the Republican Congress
will make any serious attempt in that di
rection." ;.-..-;
"But bills have been Introduced to reg
ulate trusts?" some one queried.
"Admitted," replied Mr. Bryan; "but
the Introduction of a bill doesn't carry
passage with it.
"Congress has done two things this ses
sion that are wrong. I refer to the Porto
Rico tariff laws. If you want to know
what the Filipinos will get. 7000 miles
away, look at what those West India
men are getting now from Republican
rule. I say the constitution should follow
the flag. It does not follow the flag in
Porto Rico.
"I believe the Filipinos should be given
their independence, under the same sort
of an American protectorate as is exerted
by the United States over South American
States. That sort of protection from out
side interference is consistent with Amer
ican ideals of government.
"Let us stand on American principles of
government and not upon European ideas
of imperialistic domain: The theory of
the Monroe doctrine is that the United
States is the dominant political power in
this hemisphere and will permit no Euro
pean nation to extend its influence over
other States here. It might be consid
ered somewhat inconsistent if we attempt
to govern other hemispheres.
"Porto Rico affairs are sufficient evi
dence of the attitude of the Republican
party to indicate what we may expect by
a continuance of its power. There is no
constitutional proposition to be found
which justifies the fixing of a tariff on the
products of that island. It does not mat
ter whether it be a cent or a dollar.
"People In the West are awakening.
There is a great Interest in these ques
tions. During my northern trip I spoke
twice, afternoon and evening, in Seattle.
Tacoma.and Spokane, to immense audi
ences, and I am informed that the com
mittee's estimate of the attendance at
Portland was 10.000."
There was a manifest lack. of enthusi
asm over . Bryan's appearance in the
crowded berry boats. One feeble cry of a
cheer dwindled away into the morning
mists. At the ferry depot Mr. Bryan was
hurried into a carriage and driven rapidly
to the Palace Hotel, where several hun-
dred Iroquois braves, marshaled by Max
Popper, had assembled. Mayor Phelan
and James H. Budd. on the reception
committee, were absent.
When Bryan alighted from the carriage
the small crowd in the court of the Palace
cheered once, but not lustily. The orator
was hustled in haste to the maple room,
where Jeremiah F. Sullivan. Max Popper,
Judge Lawlor, Charles Edelman. ex-Post
master Bryan and others Joined the origi
nal escorting committee in bringing for
ward the faithful for presentation to tha
chief. Presently the audience grew in
number to one hundr*>d and fifty and
shouts came. "Speech." "Speech." The
colonel, yielding to the clamor of hiscoun
trymen. addressed the audience briefly.
He said:
"I have only thre*Â» minutes' time to talk.
I am glad to be here. I was here last
year and I always come to San Francisco
whenever I can. The more I see of the
city the better I like it. The fight in
which we are engaged is not for this
year's campaign, but for many years. The
Republican party is forcing measures â it
Is putting the dollar above the man. Yon
who live on the Pacific Coast ran begin tiÂ»
understand what imperialism means. Yon
have seen what was done in Porto Rico
and you may imagine what the party will
do in the Philippines, srven thousand
miles distant. .The Democrats will go into
this campaign with an extension of thÂ«
old platform. The Republicans are wrons
on every leading proposition. They have
been looking at the shell of the egg with
out noting the change of Its contents."
As aoon as thecolonel finished his speech
the committee took him away to catch
the southbound train. The crowd cheered
as the orator vanished from view.

THREATENED TO
KILL HIM IF HE
MADE AN OUTCRY
Unusually Daring Robbery
in Schwartz's Saloon at
North Beach.
One of the boldest robberies reported to
the police for some time was committed
shortly after noon yesterday In Henry
Schwartz's saloon at Chestnut and Pow
ell streets. Three men, who are unknown
to the police;, entered the saloon and called
for the drinks. After being served one of
them struck the bartender, knocking him
out.,. His companions immediately drew
their revolvers and, after covering the
bartender, who was In a seemingly .help
less condition, went behind the bar and
took the contents of the cash register,
amounting to about $3. Immediately after
taking the money the desperate trio left
the place and made good. their escape.
The bartender who was attacked by the
robbers is named Peter Muck. After recov
ering consciousness he 'rushed to the en
trance 'of the saloon and blew a police
whistle. Several officers responded and
after learning of the robbery they mads
a search for the culprits, but without pet
ting a trace of them. It is presumed they
boarded a passlns street car and mads
their escape.
When the men entered .the saloon they
sat at a table and ordered the drinks.
There were several people In the saloon at
the time and after they left one of the
rohbers approached the bar and called for
a glass or beer. While the bartender was
In the act of drawing it he struck him In
the face, the force of the blow almost
rendering him unconscious. As he fell
prostrate to the floor two of the robbers
covered him with pistols after threatening
to blow his head off if he mado an out'
cry.
Muck describes the men as being of me
dium height and fairly well dressed. The
man who assaulted him. he say*, was
stoutly built and wore a light mustacn**.
He ts satisfied thct: he will be able to
Identify them in case they are arrested.
Immediately after the robbery was re
ported to Captain Bohen he detailed De
tectives Ryan and O'Dea. the clever
sleuths of the Southern station, to arrest
the trio. After hearing the story of the
bartender they became convinced that
the robbers are the same men who are
responsible for several hold-ups commit
ted during the past week. Captain Bo
hen Is satisfied that the men are adepts at
the business and he is doing everything
in his power to land them behind prison,
bars.

THE ALASKA
MID CAPE NOME
COMPANY
fies been organized for the purpose of
dredging for gold at Cape Nome. Alaska,
by mec^s cf a new patent dredger which
has Just been invented for that purpose.
That Cape Nome is rich Jn gold goes
lout saying. The extent of the field is
t known. For a distance" of seventy-
five miles the beach baa proven to be rich.
Tests have been made on the San Fran-
cisco beach with apparatus similar to that
which this company proposes to use at
Cape X-me. and the results have demon-
Â¦â¢ â¢ i that a surf which no barge or ves-
sel could withstand has no , nvct upon
the apparatus which it is proposed to use.
Thfi purpose of the company is to dredge
the rich deposit of sand beyond the line
of low water. Suction and hydraulic are
the forces- used InKbrinsing the *and
ashore. The capabilities of the pump as a
Band 'xcr.vatcr arc well known among all
classes or" engineers. This pump will be
constructed with interchangtable lining
the wearing parts being replaced so that
it will last indefinitely. The hydraulic jet
I? set at such an angle at the mouth of
the suction pipe that the rebound or reflex
action not only breaks up the sand so
That it will respond to the suction but
throws U up Into the mouth of the pipe.
This plant can be used hydraulically
v?ion the tundra or lands back of the
beach. The plan to be used In saving the
f< '.d is being successfully operated in New
Zealand. Australia and on the black sand
beach in Northern California. The virtue
Of this plan is that it SAVES THE FINE
GOLD and is capable of HANDLING
LARGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL
WITHOUT EXTRA COST.
It 5s said by a!l the men working on the
Vach at Ncme last stason that there was
tak^n out by each man with a rocker not
!cm than $1? per day. As no one man can.
with a mcker. work more than one yard
per day. it will be seen that the sand must
have averaged about $16 per cubic yard,
.-md a machine handling 1500 cubic yards
prr day would produce $24,000 for each
twenty-four days; and during the one
hundred days which constitutes the sea-
son. an<l during which there Is continuous
daylight, Fuch machines would produce
tZ.tQOfiW. Tbese figures seem to be enor-
mous, but they are fully borne out by the
almost unanimous opinion of those who
liave returned from Cape Nome.
Shares of thÂ« capital stock will be of-
fejwtj to the public at its par value, the
proceeds to be applied to the purchase
and fquipnient of additional dredging ma-
chinery. Owing to the limited time at its
â¢iisposal before the opening of the sea-
.^.-t.. the company is contemplating the
operation of only two or three dredgers
.luring thÂ«Â» coming summer, although
should conditions warrant it, aÂ» many as
Jive or more complete plants may be put
in operation.
App!:cations for stock or for further ln-
fom.ation should be made to the Alaska

SAN FRANCISCO ELKS'
INSTALLATION BANQUET
The officers of San Francisco Lodge of
the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks,
who March 30 were elected for the cur
rent term, were installed last Friday night
by Deputy Grand Exalted Ruler Gray,
and last evening the installation banquet
was eerved in one of the leading rotis
serles of this city.
The large dining hall was decorated with
the most beautiful of decorations, the
American flag. The members and invited
guests occupied tables s^t with eight cov
ers and each '.able was covered with a
mess of beautiful cut flowers.
The new officers who are to rule the
lodge for this year are: T. F. Bonnet, E.
R.; T. E. Dunne, E. L. X. ; H. Curzon, E.
L X.; Philip Fay, E. L. X.: G. E. Hunt,

N. Odell, D. McMillen, Jamt. P. Dunne,
trustees. :'-"â¢";:
The menu was such as Elks only have
served to them and which they know how
to enjoy. After this had been discussed
and the black coffee had been brought on
Judge A. F. Cutter, the toastmaster,
called for responses to the following
toasts: "Our Lodge." Exalted Ruler T. F.
Bonnet. At the close of his response he,
on behalf of the lodge, presented a beau
tiful loving cup to H. S. Manning, the
retiring exalted ruler, who made a very
neat reply of thanks foi the token of ap
preciation. "The Grand Lodge," F. L.
Gray: song, by "Harry" Cashman of the
Grand Opera-house: "Our Past Exalted
Rulers" J- R- Howell; "Our Mothers.
Wires Sisters and Sweethearts," Colonel
F E ' Beck; monologue. Tony Haskell;
"The Good of the Order." John J. Barrett
Then followed the beautiful sentiment of
the order, "11 o'clock," the hour when
all members, wherever assembled at that
hour, drink to those who are absent.
There were other toasts and entertain
ment. A souvenir was presented to each
guest. It was in the shape of an old-time
clock with the hands pointing to the hour
of 11. On opening the door there was ex
posed to view several leaflets with the

Sailor Drowned.
EUREKA. April 7. â The schooner For
tuna, arriving here from San Francisco,
brought news of the loss of a sailor,
Charles Edward Cass, by drowning just
above Point Arena last Xlonday afternoon.
Cass' papers show him to have been a
member of the sailors' union, and a na
tive of England, aged 29 years.
His Neck Broken.
SAN JOSE, April 7.â Ben Carleton, a 18
year-old boy, dived into the Coyote Creek
while bathing this afternoon and his neck
was broken. The water was too shal!ow
where he dived and he struck the ground.
. seen that, barring' an accident, the Colum
bia team was out of the contest. At the
I finish there was the usual scene attending
any contest in which the college spirit Is
manifested. Waiting for the Columbia
team to reach the line, the university
lads pave them three rousing cheers and
then pulled for the boathouse for a rub
down and change of garments.
It Is argued by sympathizers of the
Berkeleys that the Columbia team had
the better course toward the center of
the channel, and by those -on the opposite ,
affiliation that the inside course pave the i
collegians the advantage of partial shelter I
from the stiff breeze; but all admit that i
the victory was decisive. While not en
deavoring to cloud the triumph of the
winners, Charles Goodwin stated that a
recent change of the complement of his
I crew proved a bad handicap and Inter
fered materially with the action of the
rowers.
i This victory has so sharpened the boat

dents that future races may be looked
I upon as a certainty.
finish was at a point opposite the Colum
bia Club's quarters and the time required
by the winning team to oover the course
was nearly seven minutes, the poor show
ing as regards time being due to a choppy
sea and a â¢'Â¦.tilt head wind.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler officiat
ed as referee, Professor George C. Ed
wards and C. E. Palmer as judges. James
Hoppes as timer at the start and Prentice
Hutchinson as timer at the finish. Berke
ley secured the Inside course. The crews
were made up as follows:
Berkeleyâ M. iS. Scott, bow; J. W.
Barnes, No. 2; D. Goodale, No. 3; T. V.
Kington, stroke.
Columbiaâ J. H. Dleckmann, bow;
Charles Bates, No. 2; Charles Goodwin,
No. 3: H. H. Haight, stroke.
At the word to go both teams bent to
their oars with a will, Columbia getting
a slight lead for perhaps 3)0 yards. Then
Berkeley gradually drew up and passed
their adversaries. Once In the lead the
stretch of water between the two boats in

WINNING CREW OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
OAKLAND, April 7.â With the college
yell pealing forth from the throats
of leather-lunged sympathizers tuid
sounding as sweetest music in the
ears of the winners, with handkerchiefs
and parasols waving to the tune of tri
umphant exclamations and praise from
the feminine contingent among the sight
seers, and with the water of a choppy
channel spraying from the oars and glis
tening like myriads of Jewels In the bright
sunlight, the Berkeley oarsmen crossed
the line to-day fully 150 yards ahead cf
their athletic adversaries of the Columbia
Rowing Club. It was a clear cut, decisive
victory, and. like true sportsmen, the
members of the losing team admitted that
they had been fairly bested and added
their congratulations to the ovation re
ceived by the \'lctors at the finish.

ed husband had a wife and family In Eng
land. Witness further stated that whilo
Mrs. Lodge had never explained that
phase of the matter to him, he was of the
opinion that the reason she married
Lodge in the face of the knowledge with
which she had been furnished was be
cause she did not believe her Intended
had ever been legally married to Mary
Ann Redman, even if he had lived with
her.
It will be remembered that some three
months ago David Lodge, one of the heirs
named in the aged capitalist's la3t will
and testament, disposed of his entire
claim upon the big estate for $20,000 in
cash. The move was supposed here at
the time to have been nothing but a piece
of financiering upon the part of the other
heirs. Shortly after the details of the
transaction were completed young Lodge
disappeared and his whereabouts Is now
unknown.
From the testimony of Reynolds to-day
it appears that Lodge in disposing of nis
Interest In the big estate and leaving the
country as he did knew exactly what he
was doing as well as -what was coming
In the way of litigation even though he
did not mention it to the people with
whom he was Just then doing business.
The fact was brought out by Reynolds'
statement that Mrs. Lodge had told him
two or three years ago that she had in
formed her son Dave of the existence of
the English claimant. This piece of tes
timony created quite a stir, as It ex
plained very clearly why David Lodge
disposed of his one-third Interest In the
big estate for such a paltry sum.
During the afternoon session Attorney
Geary Intimated strongly by the tenor of
his questioning that the real reason of
Mr. Reynoius' connection with the case
was his dislike of Mrs. Prince, one of the
three children of the late Mr. and Mrs,
J. D. Lodge. These insinuations were
vigorously denied, and for a time the at
mosphere of the little room was de
cidedly warm. Witness stated that while
Mrs. "Prince had had trouble with her
mother, Mrs. Lodge, she had never had
any with him. Regarding the family
trouble referred to Mr. Reynolds said he
understood that It arose over a question
of JSOO which Mrs. Prince claimed nad
been given her but which Mrs. Lodge
maintained was a loan, and that by rea
son of the trouble Mrs. Prince, her hus
band. M. Prince, and their children did
not visit the old folks for several years.

To Tan Belgian Hare Pelts.
By S. W. Kemp. !
In order to make a success of tanning
we must commence by properly removing
the pelt. To remove the skin from the
carcass in a speedy and easy manner re-
quires a little practice, but the "main
thing is care, so as to avoid cutting the
hide except where intended. ; With a sharp
knife cut the skin from under the jaw
down the belly to the root of the tail.
To free the legs from their casing make
an incision at the toes and cut toward the
central cut down the belly.
After the hide is removed apply common
table salt to the flesh parts and rub in
well with the hand. Salt and other pre-
servatives applied, strike through and
bind down the epidermis in which the
roots of the hair are fixed, and if the salt
is not allowed to strika directly upon the
flesh side of the skin at all points, these
places will soon be denuded of fur. Roll
the skin up flesh to - flesh and allow it to
remain a day or two, and if upon examin-
ation the second day any soft spots are to
be found, salt again and work well with
the hands. Then place the hide in a so-
lution of one part salt and four parts wa-
ter,- to which, when the salt has become
thoroughly dissolved, add a few drops of
sulphuric acid. Allow the skin to remain
in this solution a few days, after which
remove and cleanse with water and par-
tially dry.
Here is where the labor comes In. "Work
the skin while in a seml-molst condition,
stretching and pulling in all directions
and working it into a flexible condition
generally.
A good way to break all the fibers is to
rub over a sauare comÂ«r of some hard
substance, such as a planed plank or iron
bar.

BELGIAN HARE RAISING
DOWN AT LOS ANGELES
Thousands of the Pretty Animals
Are Owned by People in All
Walks of Life.
LOS ANGELES, April. 6.â Los Angeles
has now become the acknowledged center
of the world for Belgian hares. Thou-
sands of them aro being raised by people
In every walk of life. The professional
man and the merchant, as well as the
laboring man, arÂ© reaping bountiful har-
vest In the way of profits from raising
this prolific little animal. Demands for
fine stock have been so great during the
past year that no person can afford to
raise meat stock for the market, and
while the Belgian hare industry may In
the distant future resolve itself Into a
meat proposition, it Is far from It now.
and at the present rate of progress It will
certainly be several years before this
country is supplied with fancy stock.
Belgian culture Is certainly a lucrative
business, and the intelligent person who
will invest a few dollars in first-class Bel-
gians will find his money doubled and
tripled in a very short space of time.
However, the great mistake made by the
beginner Is that he expects to procure
good stock cheap, and of course that can-
not be done, because standard Belgians
are a staple article of trade and are worth
high figures, and an offer to sell standard
stock at less than from $25 up Is a delu-
sion and a snare, although very good
second and third grade etock can bo
had at from JlO to $20. An ordinary $10
doÂ« bred to a cheap buck will produce
the cheapest kind of stock, only fit for
meat. But a $25 or $35 doe, bred to a high-
class buck, will produce youngsters that
will sell at from $25 to $150 each, and by
breeding up further one may produce
prize winners from the product It costs
slightly more to start with good stock,
but the profits are ten times as great.
Notwithstanding the attractive advertise-
ments In Western papers of good stock
cheap, the purchaser is only safe In deal-
Ing with a reliable breeder (not a com-
mission man), who will make affidavit to
pedigree and guarantee every animal he
ships. If he Is honest he will fill his or-
ders with better stock than If the pur-
chaser be a novice and on the ground to
make a Belectlon upon his own Judgment.
The Belgian is a cleanly little animal
and needs but little care or attention and
It Is especially noted for being able to
live and multiply on small rations, but
will amply repay any one for gouu ea.it;
and good hutches. Opinions vary consid-
erably as to the best kind of hutches to
use, but the writer has found it most suc-
cessful to build hutches Indoors, and, if
possible, on board floors, giving not less
than from 2x6 feet for each animal and
more room If convenient. The hutches and
runs should be so located that the hare
may be well protected from dogs, cats,
storms, drafts, cold night winds and es-
pecially sunshine, for sunshine will fade
their coat so as to make them unsalable
and unattractive. At the same time the
hutch must be cool enough so the animal
may not suffer from the heat In summer.
Each breeding hutch must be supplied
with a nest box at lea^t 12 inches high and
wide and 20 inches long, with an entrance
at one end 6 by 8 inches, and that to be so
arranged that it may be opened when ne-
cessary to look In. When the little ones
come keep them covered with the hair
provided by the mother until they grow
their own coat.
A mistaken Idea generally exists in ref-
erence to the feeding of Belgians, and It
Is true that more hares are killed and
ruined by the wrong kind and an over-
supply of food than is lost by disease. The
writer finds by years of experience thai
it is best to feed rolled oats in the morn-
Ing, a very little green food or carrots
at noon time, the carrots to be fed lib-
erally if the doe is nursing; rolled barley
should be fed In the evening, and a very
small amount of dry alfalfa or oat hay,
especially to the growing youngsters, but
the brood does may have all the hay they
will eat. But hay makes the youngsters
potbellied and destroys that racy appear-
ance which is so desirable. Youngsters
from birth until two months of age should
have little or no water, and if any at ail
it should be warm, placed In their hutch
until they take a drink and then removed;
after that age they may have all the cool,
fresh water they can drink. Hares should
never have food lying before them all
the time and should have only what food
they will eat up clean.

able signs this week of a top-heaviness and are
sustained by palpable manipulation and
vague rumors of extraordinary advan
tages, but whether the general . level
of prices has reached or exceeded the
point that adequately discounts the present
and future advantages to accrue to the stocks
is a que.stion much more difficult to decide.
There is quite an extended list of stocks
which have run above the high level last year
tnd risen to record prices. But practically
all of these have enjoyed an Increase In
the actual rate of dividends disbursed, or have
approached nearer to dividends by -the satis
faction of prior dividend claims of preferred
ftcoks and bonds, on which payment of income
is contingent on earnings. The only con
spicuous stock in this list to which this de
scription does not apply is Pennsylvania,
which has risen above last year's hiÂ£h level.
The dividend rate remains unchanged and the
advance in the stock Is based on the large ex
tension of control of competing and con
tributory lines in Its territory by purchase of
stocks, themselves paying dividends, and on
the earnings of the company. The stocks
which have risen above latt year's level are
all in the railroad list, the industrials being all
decidedly lower. The week's actual develop
ments bearing on securities' values have been
few, but altogether favorable.
Reports of railroad net earnings for Feb-
tuary and of gross earnings for March show
hem to be beyond all precedent, in spite of
:he very high level for comparison with last
March earnings. The oflicial reports for
March of the operation of the new financial
aw makes It evident that the banks are not
-ushing into a precipitate note inflation, and
?ven to the extent of 10 per cent increase in
present dej>osits of bonds, they have proceeded
n a leisurely manner. The high price of Gov
rnment bends has Invited large realizing and
Â¦unsequent withdrawal from circulation of
anks selling their bonds, making the outlook
egarding bank circulation much confused. But
his realizing in Governments has been ac-
panied by large liquidation of luans to New
'ork banks with which the bonds were held
nd has released capital for reinvestment, as
[.fleeted in the broad and active market for
lilroad bonds. By the disbursement of prem
jms on United States bonds, presented for
(inversion and the payment of April Interest,
he Sub-Treasury at New York has released
idditiunal sums to the money market. The
argely increased demands for stock market
perations have thus been easily met. London's
Â¦peratlons in Americans have continued on a
arge scale, but the sterling exchange rate has
ontinued upward. London selling to take
ronts partly explains this. The fact is also
ited that, while buying low-priced stocks,
Jon was selling the high-priced ones, thus
?avins a credit balance on account. The
rospects of the - grain crops and the cvi-
lences of foreign needs in the grain markets
ire elements of increasing Influence In the
lock market.
Business In the bond market has been on
. very larce scale and lower class bonds with
he prospects of betterment have been the fa-
vcrites.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The Financier says
The statement of the Associated Banks of
New York, issued April 7, Is remarkable for Its
variation from known facts rather, than for any
Influence It will have on the current money
market. In the first place figures prove that
the treasury last week was a debtor to the
clearing-house Institutions for about $4,000,000,
and operations with the Interior resulted In a
tain of at least one million additional. Instead
of showing the effect of these additions to cash
holdings the statement reveals a gain of less
than two and one-half millions In Bpecie and
an actual loss of three-quarters of a million In
legals. In other words, the banks gained lesn
than one and three-quarter millions during the
week. - Assuming this to have been the case,
the weekly exhibit becomes immediately logical.
The expansion in loans, coupled with the slight
increase in cash, accounts for an expansion of
$14,679,000 in deposits, and as the latter call for an
extra reserve of $3,669,700, the actual surplus Is
reduced $1,931,350, which Is entirely different from
what previous calculations indicated. There Is
no method of analysis by which this conflicting
showing can be explained. Operations of sin
gle large banks don't figure as Important fac
tors Jn the totals, the changes having been
more generally distributed through the entire
list than usual. The expansion In loans, of
course, results from the week's activity in spec
ulative circles, and this was naturally respon
sible for the deposit Increase. The unexplained
feature Is the failure to reflect the cash gains,
but the system of averages employed in compil
ing the statement probably has obscured for the
time being the additions to the reserve. The
heaviest decrease in cash reported by any one
bank was only about two millions, not suffi
cient of .Itself to have accounted for the disap
pointing exhibit. The banks have added $437,500
to circulation, bringing the total to $20,574,&00.
Next week's statement will probably prove of
an entirely different character from the pres
ent one, as the April disbursements in the form
of Interest and dividend payments will have
been rather fully settled.
London Market.
NEW YORK, April 7.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was rather quiet in the markets here
to-day. Stocks opened dull on the war news,
but quickly recovered, and the closing was
fairly firm. Consols were 101%, and the war
loan finished at 1 13-16 premium, after touching
1%. Americans were distinctly good, hardening
throughout, and prices were well over, parity.
They closed at the best. Â¦ There was consider
able German buying. Chesapeake and Ohio and
Union Pacific were features. Copper shares
arted weak, but rallied later. Tintos were
6!Â»Vi@ii3%. Anacondas were 10%@10%. Call
money was In good supply, but fixtures were
.harder and bills were firmer. A moderate sup
ply was offered.
A new combination of cotton and wool dyers
Is announced, amalgamating forty-six busi
nesses, with a share capital of Â£2,000,000 and
Â£7.',0,000 debentures.
The Board .of Trade returns for March show
that imports Increased 8.2 per cent and exports
Increased 13.8. There was a decrease in Amer
ican grain shipments. Cotton Imports Increased
In quantity 261,000 hundredweight and In value
$1,650,000.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, April 7.â Corn opened weak, but
found some friends after a -concession of about
half a cent from yesterday's closing figure.
.They held It up and gradually forced It up a
shade over, yesterday, but these were not
strong enough to hold' the advantage. There
was a bearish element at work In the pit, and
considerably^ emboldened by the report that
certain heavy longs were ready to reap. their
harvest of profits, brought considerable pressure
to the selling side. There were those who
thought the market much too broad to be In
fluenced by a single heavy speculator, or even
a coterie of them, one student of the situation
remarking that the great American steers and
hogs were running to corn a great deal this
season. Some reports made country accept
ances over night, freerer, while others said the
farmers will still be disposed to keep the
coarse grain In their own cribs. Liverpool was
lower for futures, but firm . for spot. Balti
more reported 250,000 bushels accepted by the
other side.
May opened %c down at 39%@40c, advanced
to 40% c and then reacted to 39% c, closing
steady, 9iÂ® lie down at 39%@40c. Trada ' was
active at times, but the volume of business
showed a falling off from recent quantities.
Wheat was dull and weak. Shorts had their
eyes on the action of. corn, but the general at
titude-was bearish arid it told In the end. Jhe
cash demand was poor and the supply on the
floor generally was over the demand.
The market took a brace following the open-
Ing in sympathy with corn, - but promptly
weakened when the big cereal reacted. The
speculative trade was light. New York re
ported five loads taken for export. Seaboard
clearances in wheat-flour were equal to 850,000
bushels.
May opened unchanged at 66%@66T4e, de
clined to C6%c, reacted with corn to 66%0 and
then broke to 66Hc, at which the market
closed, H@%c under yesterday..
The provision market was firm and fairly ac
tive In spite of the grain easiness and lower
prices at the yards. A good demand for pack
ers, together with fear of the rise in ribs, the
supply of which is light, were the factors. In
terest was keenly centered- in May ribs. Shorts
were very nervous. May ribs closed 10c
over yesterday at $7 02V4. May pork closed 2V40
up at $12 70 and May lard 2%c better at $6 60.
There was considerable profit-taking through
out the session.
The oats market followed corn. The specu
lative market was tame. May closed %o
lower at 24% c.
The leading futures ranged aa follows:

receipts at this port since January 1 at 85.375
bags, against 62,484 bags during the same tims
last year. The sales from first hands were 35,
229 bags, against 36.715. The stock in first hands
April 1 was 59,304 bags, against 29.236. The
world s visible supply April 1 was 6.222.936 bags,
against 6,515.558 last year. The circular says:
"Heavy local arrivals and the easier condi
tion of other markets have resulted In a di
vided sentiment between buyers and sellers as
to the future of prices. Coupled with dullness
of trade this has narrowed the movement here
during the past fortnight and at the present
moment it is difficult to effect sales unless at
concessions which the principal holders decline
to concede, although generally willing to meet
fractional differences. Enough coffee, however,
has been offered and sold at about buyers'
views from various sources â sometimes from
second handsâ to keep Jobbers supplied and
those who would sell were compelled to enter
the market anad they found It not the one they
wished.
"Demand Is again running largely to coffeea
cf cheap cost rather than those of merit and
higher, value, and Is sufficient to keep stocks
of the former continually at an ebb and prices
fairly firm, although recently affected in a small
degree by easier rates for unwashed Salvador.
\ Isible supply figures show a decrease during
March of 225.000 bags.
"Stocks in first hands consist of 10,913 bags
Costa Rica. 272 Nicaragua, 13.026 Salvador, 31,

NEW TORK. Arrll 7.â The speculative en
â¢\ . .r.*:r. for an advance In price of securities
received a derided chock In the showing made
\y the Clearing-house banks In their weekly
statement to-day. The buying demand fell
&way and stocks came upon the market at de
clining prices. The most Important part of
the earlier palr.s were wiped cut and the mar
ket closed unsettled and Irregular prices mov
ir.K In contrary directions In different parts of
the list and net changes being much mixed.
The short session thus ended began aus
piciously enough, under the Influence of re
newed buying orders from abroad, which were
paid to have their source In Holland. Bull
pools resumed their operations In various
stocks and the continued strength In Sugar
gave tone to the industrial list. Pennsylvania,
Daltimoi* and Ohio preferred, Missouri Pa
rific and Chesapeake and Ohio were in con-
Kjiieuous examples of strength. The list
promptly gave way on appearance of the bank
statement upon the tape. Preliminary esti
mates of gains In cafh had placed it from four
to six million dollars. Operations with the
Pub-Treasury furnished an increase of $4,000,
000 to the banks. Wall street Is in the dark
as to what drain upon the banks' resources has
m> far offset this advantage as to bring the
ra*h increase down to $1,735,400. It was also
expected that the continued liquidation of loans
for account from holders of Government bonds.
Vihn have been celling them to realize on the
advance in prices, would offset the expansion
of loan* on account of stock market trans
actions to a large extent. The large realizing
cf epeeulatlve profits In the stock market was
Jndif&Uv* also of a paying ott ot loans to some
exttnt. The street was wholly unprepared
for a large increase In loar#, which ehowed
the foremost expansion of $12,954,300. This
served to swell the reserve requirements to the
extent of J3.eC3.750 and the cash increase fell
ehort of this by Jt.BJI.JSO, which therefore
measured the shrinkage In the surplus. The
Inference is clear and unmistakable that the
encroachments made by speculative demand
upon the loanable resources of the banks have
been outrunning their increase from other
sources. A check to epeculative activity Is
Indicated.
The week has witnessed the continued opera
tion of the forces la the etock market, which
have been generally foreseen as the result of
the tr^nd of events for some time past. The
growing conviction In the continuance of pros
perous conditions in the country and the sea
sonable relaxation in the markets have been
the broad, underlying factors In the strength of
the etock market. As usual, the professional
operators in Ftocks have been beforehand In
buying and they have availed themselves of
the considerable advances in prices to sell out
and take their profits. This has caused an
irrepular market during the week, prices ad
vancing et one point while reacting at another.
The best prices have not been maintained
and In many stocks many declines ha\*e re
sulted. It was the rule of operations with
dealers In the *tr>ck market on a large scale to
sell out their holdings and take their profits
ct a flxeij jK>lnt In the advance, while the out
tide buying demand was FtlU active and well
distributed without regard to the existing
favorable outlook for a further rise of prices.
The r ;.-â¢â¢ Is based on the importance of afford
ing an opportunity for the digestion of the
marketable supply of etocks by the Investment
demand, which is the only true final support
of any market. Such a process of digestion
Invariably interrupts from time to time any
long-continued advance in prices. If it Is ac
complished without any considerable setback in
prices and the investment demand is unim
paired, professional buyers come back into the
market and take on large holdings again, and
wilh the floating supply of etocks thus re
duced, find it easy to advance prices to a still
higher level, when they find It safe to sell out
and take their profits again. This sequence
of events may be repeated Indefinitely. It Is
inevitable that prices should thus be carried
above the level of Intrinsic value, with the re
rult of a constantly Increasing pressure to pell,
the inside investment holders, seeing the stock
selling for more than it Is worth, Joining with
the less-informed Epeculatlve operator to un
load their holdings. Then follows a collapse,
wiping out of margins, shrinkage in the value
<if collateral and often panic. When the cell
ing to take profits begins to predominate over
the buying demand, as has been the case in
the latter part of the wetk, a period of cau
tion and careful scrutiny ensues to detect
whether the rise In prices has reached Its cul
mination. 8omÂ« stocks have given unmUtak-

MEET IN CONVENTION
Seventy-nlna delegates. representing
twelve societies, were present when retir
ling President T. Earle called the con
vention of the Northern California De
bating League to order yesterday morn
ing in the Mission High School. The elec
tion of officers resulted as follows: Presi
dent, G. M. Dill; first vice president, M.
Keane; second vice president. I. Magin
niss; secretary, A. S. Wiester; treasurer.
Miss D. Spencer; auditors. G. W. Gallo
way and Miss C. Frickstad.
A trophy offered by Stanford University

the pupils of Mission High School and

Aegis was selected as 4 the official organ
of the league and the convention ad
journed to meet in Stockton October 7,
1900.
An interesting debate conducted under
the auspices of the league was held last

The subject under discussion was "Re
solved. That United States Senators
Fhould be elected by direct vote of the

1&00; Beatrice T. O'Neill, '00. and A. S.

Â»
Overture, Harrlgan & Wiegand's Im
ported dog, the running qualities of which
have been a matter of discussion among
coursing men for the last few days, ran
Its first public course yesterday in the
open Etake at Ingleside Coursing Park
ar.d made a good impression. Drawn with
Manila. Overture held its own In the brisk
betting, Belling at even money. From the
flip the new dog led Manila and showed
Jive lengths of epeed throughout and won
in good Etyle, though the hare favored
Manila.
The general opinion after the course
â¢was that Overture would show well down
on the card to-day with a good chance
for the etake. Young America had a se
vere course with Green Valley Maid, run
ning the longest course of the day after
an undecided. The hard work may iln
terfcre with Young America's running in
the finals. Golden Rule ran well, and
afralnst Esmeralda should furnish a good
course to-day. Lottie M showed in better
form than she has for a long time, and a
olose race is looked for in her run with
Maid of the Mill.
The card for to-day presents some very
evenly matched dogs and good coursing
is predicted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 8, 1900.
r-~~"HE announcement recently maae in
The Call that George G. Radcliff of
Watsonville had announced himself
as a candidate for the office of
rand trustee of the Grand Parlor of the
.'ative Eons of the Golden West has at
racted a creat deal of favorable atten-
lion to the candidate. Tnere are seven
grand trustees to be elected, and Watson
viiie Parlor, of which he has been
a member for more than fourteen
years, of which he has been the
president ar.d by which he has a
ruinUr of times been honored for his
f.fie:ity to the order, having been com-
NATIVE SONS WANT
HIM FOR TRUSTEE
missioned district deputy grand president,
desires that he should be one of the seven.
Mr. Radcliff is well known in the legisla
tive halls of the order, for he has repre
sented his parlor in the Grand Parlor at
Fresno. San Rafael. Chlco, Santa Rosa,
Eureka and Nevada. By reason of his in
timate knowledge of the work of the or
ganization and its needs, which he ac
quired as a close observer in his various
capacities as member and officer of his
parlor, as district deputy and as delegate
to the highest body, there are but few
who are better qualified to fill the position
he seeks. Not only is he eminently quali
fied but he is energeUc. zealous and one
of those Native Sons who wishes to see
the order advance and prosper. As a
State legislator he made a good record, as
an officer of the order in which he takes
so much pride he has made a record of
which any one could feel proud, and if he
becomes the choice of his fellow delegates
at Oroville he will as a grand officer work
to the end that the record he has already
made shall be made still brighter.
Watsonville Parlor In an appeal to the
other parlors of the State In favor of Mr.
RadclifT says: "Watsonville Parlor has
never during its existence of fifteen years
received recognition on the board of grand
officers, which demonstrates that it has
not asked for more than its share of honor
when it asks your support of Brother
Itadcliff's candidacy. Our parlor's claim
Jor a grand officer is certainly deserving
at the hands of the delegates to the Grand
Parlor of a most liberal support. As one
among the oldest parlors in the State,
with a good, active membership of loyal
Native Sons, and a financial record of
which we are proud, we feel at this mo
ment free to petition the delegates to the
Grand Parlor to help us as we have helped
others in placing our candidate among
the honored board of grand trustees."

The. party went to San Jone Friday

to Niles. Mr. Schussler showed first the
Calaveras Valley property of the" com
pany, which would, he said, when blocked
with a dam 1000 feet long, 230 feet high
and having its top 825 feet above the level
of the bay, the dam to cost $3,000,000 and
the piping, etc., to bring the cost up to
about $6,000,000, be able to supply 30,000.000
gallons of water daily to -San Francisco.
Subsequently the place where Mr. Schuss
ler discovered the underground course of
*the Calaveras Creek and developed a very
large flow of water from the gravel was
visited. Then the party saw the dam and
works at Sunol and the dam across Niles
Canyon.
The property across the bay Is only
partly developed. Nothing has been done
In the Calaveras Valley except to pick a
site for the future dam. At Niles Canyon
8,000,000 gallons of water are caught dally
to supply San Francisco south of Market
street, east of Montgomery, and on Tele
graph Hill. At San Jose the visitors were
entertained at the Sainte Claire Club.
