and there was a laugh In the voice

healthy Irish ruddiness bloomed In all
the faces that Maggie Fogaxty, now Mrs.

high-strung climate. John and Margaret

air. and it was good to be alive. Here In
Ban Francisco, too, the could look at the
" world eye to Â«ye and fear nothing. There
was no hand then to fear.
The first time she felt the touch of the
hand was after Josephine went awayâ but

Then* the; -words went back and said
themselves again, and I broke in briskly

met me on safe ground and the face grew
sure once more.
For the morning sun was deluging her
room, and there were those who meant
well, like the sunshine, and had come to
chat through a friendly hour with her,
and the day side of nature was upper
most. I believe it is Robert Owen who
writes of the nicht sMe.
Mrs. Margaret Dunton has seen ths
night side. She has been afraid of some
thing that, she could not see, something*
that she could not hear, something that
she could not touch. It comes when the
sun has slipped away. Then the sudden
dark strides in, gulping houses and trees
and people as it comes. Then a lonely old
woman, who looks for no more from life,
sits In her room 'Â¦ In an upper flat and
reads over letters which tneir writers
have forgotten, and caresses the painted
ribbon nonsenses that Josephine < treas
ured, and then

jeering down, she feels the hand.
It comes behind her and pushes, pushes
â¢-â¢he struggles and pits her strength
against It and it gives way.- She turns, ts
see no one there. The precipice Is gone
and she Is at home once more.
But . every â¢ time the hand comes It
pushes harder and after every struggle
she Is weaker.
"Some dayâ the time will come whanâÂ£
she says.
After a few years of married Ufa In
California the poetry died out of the Irish
love story. Just why I do not know. Mar
garet was the same as everâ good to look
upon. Her cheeks would still have
shamed roses and her hair still, played at
being sunshine, and her eyes were still
like the, flowers of the nemophlla. The
wholesome beauty of her native land was
In her face and her strong young body.
There Is plenty of It left even to-day, for
the matter of that, though she is only a
lonily old woman who fears.
. . jHer mother had died when she waÂ» 11,
her father a few years later, and then
John Woodlock had brought her -to a
strange land and had Bet out to be to her
husband and all besides. But It did not
last. The day came when she went to
visit her sister In Dublin, and wrote back
to Mr. Woodlock to sue for divorce on the
ground of desertion. He did sb, and after
the divorce was secured she returned to
San Francisco.
"I think fate meant me to bÂ« always
alone," she says.
Stlll she had never stood upon the preci
pice; had never felt the hand. She was
not entirely happy, but she was living
comfortably enough on the property which
her father had left her. As time went on
she came to know Oliver Dunton. She
thought of him as a boy at first, for he
was almost a score of years younger than
she. and she used to play adviser and com-
forter to him. Ho found the little home
a cozy place In which to spend the even-
Ing. He could take his pleasures or his
troubles there and be sure that either
would be kindly received. The big chair
was always ready for him, and It seemed
to grow more and more comfortable as the
weeks went by, and It was the nicest
thing In the world to see the way Mrs.
Margaret would whip the album and the
vaae off the sitting-room table, spread out
a white cloth and set forth a ginger-bread
and buttermilk supper. By and by young
Mr. Dunton came to notice how bewltch
lngly the hair waved oC Its own accord
over Mrs. Margaret's temples. At the
same time she' began to feel her attitude
ebanglng, and she could not be quite as
motherly as she once had been.
There came to be seven years of happy
married life to Mrs. Oliver Dunton.
She put up the building where she now
lives on Seventeenth street. Below Is a
store that used to bring in a neat little
rent, and above Is the spick and span fiat
where the Duntons made their home. The
lace curtains were crisp In their newness,
and the upholstery or the new furniture
stood up springy and proud. The same
furniture is there to-day, but It is not as
proud as it once was.
After the two had snuggled down In the
flat it seemed that life was complete. They
adopted a little girl and gave her, the pret
tiest name that they, could find in the back
of the dictionaryâ Josephine, She grew up
to be one of California's 'daughters, her
beauty fed by the wind and the sun and
the fog. But she brought trouble into. the
little home. She caused disagreement be
tween the foster-parents, and at last came
their separation. All in ' a .breath, * Mrs.
Dunton awoke to" find her. husband parted
from her, her adopted daughter gone from
home, her property involved. â¢" She could
hardly take in'- all' the trouble at once.* It
was so great/ so;,much .for her brain to

As she brooded and brooded and brooded
she came nearer . to the night side. At

Then they crew confused. When she sat
down by herself to think of them they Â¦
seemed to whirl and take indistinct
shapes, out of which nothing could bÂ«

She wondered what It meast. Thar*
was a strange pressure in the team*
"It wasn't like a headache at aO." sas
told me. "It was as If the brain was

seemed to be something lnslds that kept
gnawing, gnawing."
Her hand stole to her forehead again
and her eyes grew once more fixed and
fearing. When she talks of these thirty*
she feels a touch of the txnueen hand.
"I knew Â«omethlnj we* wrong," s2m
went on after a second. She was calm
now. "I know, but I dreaded to say, cv*a
to think what I feared. I west tÂ» St.

grave, "be careful; It la the first sign."
She knew. at. last what It all meant.
Over the precipice lay madness tn very
truth.
She tried to look the matter fairly la
the face. The band was growing sOtmaer
day by day and the struggles sgstnst It
were longer and harder. She was coming
to be always afraid. In the street Â»h*

when there comes a summons to court.
Borne of these things I had heard when
I went to see her last week. I found a
tidy little home, kept neat and sweet by
the touch of the homemaker. She Is a

"This is all the day side of nature," said
; I to myself.
But as she talked I caught glimpses of
something else. She clung to a well-bred
composure while she told of her 1okÂ«js;
she repeated the story that was already
known of her growing fear of lnÂ»tÂ£itT.

the struggle on the brink had grown so

says, "the endless litigation; If I could

Great Illiteracy in Russia.
The illiteracy of Russia exceeds that <t
any other country claiming to have a
civilized government. The HumanlUr
lan states that In 10,000 villages of the
vast empire there Is not a school and It Is
estimated that not 20 per cent of the pop
ulation of the empire has acquired even
the rudiments of a common school edu
cation. It has been figured out that If
the Czar would disband 100.000 men of the
vast army he would thereby save money
enough to provide a school for each of
these villages. It Is not surprising that
the Czar should desire to reach some ar
rangement with the other nation* which
would permit him to partially disarm.

of the Mongolians as Readily as

Mr. Richard says that the movement to
ward vast reforms proposed by the young
Kmperor two years ago was largely
through the influence of the publications
of the society.
"That was a great beginning," says Mr.
Richard, "and had not the Empress Dow
ager again taken the Government into her
own hands China would by this time be
well upon Its way to a quicker civilization
and reform. The Empress Dowager's pol
icy of conservatism Is a great blow to
China's prospects, trending the nation
backward toward superstition and igno
rance.
"The Empress Dowager favors an antl
forelgner policy, and so long as her rule
continues the best hope of China lies in
the action of the powers who are her
greatest friends. It Is to be hoped that.
In the name of humanity and the best in.
terests of China herself, some friendly
power will take her In hand, keep her
from being divided up and help her on !n
the path of progress. Then instead of to
lng a menace to the peace of the world
she may be the means of bringing great
good to all nations."
In regard to the plans of the society. Mr.
Richard says: "China Jias about two hun
dred centers of examinations, aggregating
some half-million students, and our aim
Is to circulate useful literature, to these
two hundred centers of examiryitlons. so
that when these students retui/n to their
homes and become officers In the Govern
ment or engage in other departments of
life they may carry light Into the great
darkness which now prevails In China.
We hope these students will be Instru
mental in the uplifting of China."
Besides being a missionary and philan
thropist. Mr. Richard is also a business
man of some wealth. His work, aside
from Its objective purpose of Influencing
Chinese educational affairs, has been the
source of a considerable income, and he
has been a successful investor In different
enterprises In China. Speaking of China's
future, ha lays great stress on her com
ing commercial value, especially In her re
lations with tha United States.
"China has long used American petro
leum." said he. "and It needs American
medicines', chemicals and disinfectants.
It neÂ«ds waterworks and sewers. It needs
telephones, telegraphs and Â«.ectrlc lights.
When the sun goes down In China nigh*

of people seek their beds In the darkness.
It needs electric railways; cities with

China, however, is waking up. American
decks, watches and sewing machines are
finding ready sale. The farming Industry
of the empire la growing to be important,
and China needs American farm machin
eryâthrashing michlnes and separators.
Why. at present the grain used In China
is rolled out on thrashing floors and sifted
out with hand fans or by the accom
modating winds.
"Yes." said Mr. Richard, "China Is go-

manufacturing in the future, and it Is
therefore of the greatest Importance to
Americans that America should see to It
that there Is an "open door' In China."

A Chat Concerning Wagner'
Bayreuth and San Francisco
t- ij -HE recent Wagner lecture-concerts,
. I with Gadstt. Dnmroseh. nispham
j^ fc-nd the other artists as interpreters,
have attuned the ears of our music
lovers to the music-dramas of Richard
Wagner. Musicians, these many miles
fiway, are turning their thoughts longing
ly to the coming festival at Bayreuth.
"Rayreuth!" "Rayreuth!" â¢â¢Bayreuth!"
fighs the penniless Wagnerlte. "Bay
reuth?" queries the uninformed.
VSayreuth is the central point of the
_J.*lcal world. It is the mecca to which
lovers of music make their pilgrimage
with Moslem devotion during the season
of the great reprÂ«*sentations of the music
drama* of Richard Wagner.
Mr. DamroFch has attended many of the
Rayreuth festivals, having been fortunate
to hear one production under the per
â¢or.al supervision of the great Wagner
telir.self. A chat with Mr. Damrosch is
the next choice to a visit to Bayreuth. for
be makes you Bee the theater on the hill
side where, tinder ideal conditions, the
treat art of Germany and of the modern
world has Its home.
And whether you are a Wagnerite or no;
whether you long for Bayreuth or Brazil;
whether you are poet, politician, phil
osopher, musician or layman, it is Inter
esting to ponder upon the fact that
periodically from all po'nts of the com
pass men and women gather to listen to
the marvelous productions in the most
wonderful theater in the world.
From an early period in his career Rich
ard Wagner chafed under the conditions
of the conventional operatic stage and he
gradually found the ideal which was
eventually realized at Bayreuth. It was
through the royal patronage of the late
Louis II of Bavaria that the dreams of
Richard Wagner became a tangible
reality.
Bayreuth was selected as the place for
ttie Fit* of the temple of the new art. On
Jaay 22. IST2, the members of the "Wagner
Unions" and others Interested gathered at
Bayreuth to assist in laying the corner
stone O f t jj e new t heater and to listen to a
performance of the ninth symphony of
I?cetho}-en cor.luctcd by Wagner and exe
cuted by the best orchestra and chorus
that Germany could offer.
Of this memorable occasion Wa^nc-r
himself wrote: "Who might escape a se.-.se
of wonder and admiration upon taking his
place on this '22<\ of May, lbT2. in the very
buii'Jing (the old opera-house of P.ayrenth)
where once the Margrave and- his ques;Â«,
Frederick the Great himself at their heaJ,
assembled to witness the representation of
ballot. Italian opera or French comotly,
and upon hearing produced upon this very
FJapro. by German musicians conio togeth
er to the festival from all parts of ilio
Fatherland, the mighty harmonies of the
ninth symphony? When, from the station
Tvliore once the laced court trumpeters
stood and blew their blasts of serviio
greeting to the princely guest? of a uc
pendent court, a chorus of inspired Ger
man singers now greeted the assemblo-l
audience with the 'selb umschlungen mi!
lionen'âfor whom were not the tones U.en
fraught with some vision of the near tii
umph of the German intellect?"
Under such auspices was the cornerstone
laid for the building that after Wagner"*
death should resound with the liv'ng
strains of Wagner's art. A road bordered
by linden trets leads up to the grounds
about the theater. The grounds are used
for promenades during the two intermis
sions, which are each nearly an hour in
length. At the foot of the hill one sees
the quaint old city, with Its crooked
streets and tiled roofs. Through thi vjl
ley winds the Main, flowing a delicate sil
ver thread to gradually widen on its way
to Frankfort. Against the bLue of the sky
are the low green hills in which Bayreuth
snuggles. j
The theater itself, viewed from the out
side, while it Is not ugly, is not archi
tecturally beautiful. Wagner himself
frankly admitted that externally it is
without artistic harmony or beauty. The
utmost care was devoted to its Internal
arrangements, and the outward shape wan
left to accommodate Itself to Internal con-
*re extinguished, all hut one row, from
which a glimmer Is barely perceptible.
The theater is all but absolutely dark
and no inspection of costumes or read
ing of texts and scores is possible.
For a minute or two there Is a deep,
profound silence, then from the myaterl
ous space between the two proscenia
rise the first notes of the overture. Any
ill-bred stranger who should so much aa
whisper would soon learn that he Is In a
Hace where art has all the meaning and
demands all the respect elsewhere ac
coiaed to religion.
As stated before, the performance be
elns at 4 and lasts until 10. with two in
termissions of an hour each. Most of the
epectatirs bring a luncheon with them In
stead oÂ£ going home to dine, thus taking
no risk of being shut out through being a
moment late.
Frau Wasner lives In Bayreuth with her
son Slegfrle?. Their home la called the
"Villa Wahnfrled" and here Frau Wan
ner entertains the friends who come to
the festival. *h!ch. since her husband's
death, she personally superintends.
It Is the ambi-.ton of every Wagnerlan
singer to be chosen to sine at the Bay
reuth festival. T^ese festivals are only
successful from an standpoint, so
the performers are not paid a tithe of,
what they can comirand elsewhere. But
It is an honor dearly Bought and highly
prized. As yet It has fallen to few Amer
icans. Nordlca has su:Â»g a leading part
and onÂ« or two others Have been given
minor roles. The California gtrl has yet
to have her chance.
But according to Mr. D&mroech, "ti
Francisco audiences have enough musical
dittoes as best it might. 'Wagner regard
ed this theater as merely provisional. He
believed that the problem once given visi

The entire structure of the btillding was

pen in Chinese liieroglypnics and evident
ly tinkles musically to a mandarin's ear

finding their way from end to end of
China.
When Timothy Richard was a young
man of Â£5 he went Into the Orient to add
Ms mote to the tiny ray of light plerring
the gloom of Chinese superstition and ig
norance. The tiny day has grown into a
bigger and brighter one. but the head of
the man has prown gray. Thirty years of
missionary work among the Chinese has
ellvered his hair and furrowed hjs brow.
His friends, white and yellow, prevailed
upon him to take a much needed rest. So
It was that with the passengers of the
Gaelic Timothy Richard landed ta Ban
Francisco. :
Mr. Richard's tongue Is so steeped In
Chinese that It takes awkwardly to Eng
lish. According to account, his verse Is
â¢uch elaborate, embroidered Chinese that
It would lose flavor "done Into" English.'
Mr. Richard himself would not attempt 1L
"I am a Chinese poet." he says, "and
have no more wish to translate these chil
dren of my brain than the fond mother
has to remold her darlings. 1 have lived
so long in China and so close to the Chi
nese that I think and speak their lan
guage as easily as my own. I have never
written English poetry, nor do I think I
could. My thoughts seem to find their
true setting In Chinese verse and meter."
In this age of freaks this Ikerary freak
cannot be accounted the least. For an
Englishman born and bred to slight the
mufie of his countrymen is strange. For
a Chinese muse to come at the beck and
call of a foreigner is stranger yet.
During his long residence in China Mr.
Richard has not confined himself to de
lighting the Chinese intellect, but has also
eought to save the bouls of the yellow
men. He has combined poetry with mis
sionary work, often making poetry the
handmaiden of missionary work, trying
to give them the gospel through the
pleasant medium of poetry.
For the past ten years Mr. Richard has
bÂ«en secretary of the Society for the Dif
fusion of Christian and General Knowl
edge Among the Chinese. With the aid
of this society, he has published over 100
different books and pamphlets in the last
yearâ over 37,000,000 pagesâ and so well
have these books been received that sev
eral of them have been republlshed by the
Chinese in different provinces.

Mr. Moody's sermons. They are In pam

designed solely for observation; the very
position of his seat turning; his gaze in

"The greater number of these wounds," he
says, "were caused by the Mauser bullet,
and nearly all presented the characteristic!
featuresâ a small circular, slightly de
pressed area covered by a black scab. The
?xlt wounds often were similar, but a lit
tle larger, sometimes presenting a scar

"When I saw them a week or ten daya
after the injury they were for the most

In their path is nothing short of marvel

to those that are recovered from Is be

is abundantly clear that one lung and
often both lungs may be traversed, and
In many directions, without causing grave
symptoms, and often without producing;
any symptoms of lunjr trouble at all."
A halt was called on operations for per
forating abdominal wounds because so
many recoveries from such wounds were
noted. So. too, the previous* indications
for operations in such cases had to be re
vised completely. Recovery from wounds
of the knee joint were so many as to make
a chapter entirely new in the experience
of the surgeons. The same Is true of
wounds to other Joints. In pelvic Injuries

bo he planted fruit and made JSO.OOO. I
thought I could ral?e fruit as well as

makes a bold stretch at a fourteen-year

his plain, strong little face Is pinched and

He stepped forward and opened the

letter I inclosed one of Introduction.
Hut the State secretary was evidently
suspicious. On the morning after my ar

tel a young Hollander whose card was
decorated with a coronet, and who told
me that he was a secretary of Dr. Leyds,
come to express that gentleman's regrets
that he would not be able to receive me â
that he was not in good healthâ that he
was too busyâ there were lots of other
good reasons, but 1 have forgotten them.
So I was inclined to be discouragedâ for
r.ot only was I there minus my precious
dispatch case, but, apparently, the State
Secretary had determined that I should
not see President Kruger, nor anything
else worth mentioning at the Boer cap
ltal.
But Just then along came a pplendid
Boer friend, Mr. Jooste, of the Volksraad.
"We had been fellow passengers to the

he had the previous one. and we entered

about that. Jooste took me by the hand
and steered me around the corners of the
apartment until we stopped by the side
of an armchair. In which there sat. with
a pipe between his teeth, a grand old
farmerâ a sort of apostolic cowboyâ that
was Paul Kruger. He sat in state as the
master of this roomful of long-haired
burghers, belching forth guttural phrases
which sounded blasphemous tj my earsâ

When Paul Kruger caught sight of us,
and Jooste whispered something in h's
car, he lo'oked at me with bovine stolidity,
while the fifty apostles did the same.
Then he prunted, and the fifty echoes
made one more grunt. 1 learned after
ward that the=e fifty burghers were not
here as an official Council of State; on
the contrary, they were Oom Paul's
friends, who hud merely dropped in for a
chat over a pipe and a bowl of coffee.
It Is but fair to Mr. Kruger to admit
that he eucceeded in making me feel thor
oughly uncomfortable. His fixed, stolid,
Ins-CFUtable and ambiguously benevolent
gaze rested upon me with suffocating
force. His fifty apostles backed this gaze
with equally impassive eyes, all turned
upon the intruder from far away, who
tried meanwhile to make believe that this
sort of reception was quite customary In
Books, and a benediction. The b&Mss dl

The President told m<* a story to UlujÂ»
trats his wickedness as a youngster. Of
course we know that his childhood and
youth were spent mainly In cattle wag
or.-, and that he did not get an oppor
tunity for being baptized tmtfl he was 15.
But In spitp of all these educational hand
icaps, the Boers who led this gypsy Ufa
for so many years managed to hold fast
to the Bible and give the youngsters a
wholesome dose of good old-fashioned
Calvinistlc doctrine. But Kruger was
rated as a very bad lad In his day, meas
ured of course by the standard of the
"Dopper Church." He told me that he was
not merely the best wrestler, the best
rider and the beat shot of his time, but
was also noted for playing all sorts of
pranks calculated to shock the good peo
ple of his community. I suppose he was
a bit of a Tom Sawyer in his way.
The first church for the new town was
about ready.- I forget the cane â perhaps
It was Rustenburg. At any rate, young
Kruger. along with the r-r,t of the peopl*
of that community, had worked upon the
eacred edifice, and the tlm? tame for some
solemn function connected with Its dedi
cation. On that particular day, when all
the people, in solemn garb and mien, had,
assembled to do honor to the occasion,
there was a psychological moment when
all gazed up to the rocf and saw a young
ster standing on his head, clacking his
heels together. That youngster was Paul
Kruger.
What happened after that has not yet
become accessible to the historian. I
heard that Influences were subsequently
brought to bear upon him which produced
a change of heart, to say nothing of a
new skin. His father appealed to him In
various ways â first at one end, then a:
the other. Which prevailed I know not-
Some years after this young Kruger be
came subject to melancholia and retired
to the wilderness without letting any one,
not even his wife, know of his whsro-
abouts. He was several days absent an<t
then his neighbors went in search. They
were pulded to him by hearing the chant
ing of hymns In the distanceâ and from,
my experience of that voice ther must
have v.card him a day's Journey off. Poor
Kruger had been fasting, and was bo
emaciated that he had to be held oa

After passing the Fentry we knocked at
the front door of the Kruger mansion â
which mansion, by the way, was of about
the size and appearance of a farm out
building. No answer! We knocked a sec
ond time, and louder. There was no an
swer! My friend pushed the door open,
and we stood in a hail which traversed
the whole house, and led to a big yard
beyond. We knocked again. No answer!
We went out Into the yard and shouted
âno answer! A negro girl poked her head
out of a Bide building, but withdrew It
suddenly on seeing us. Evidently Mrs.
Kruger disliked bells and parlor-maids.
Then I eald to Jooste that I presumed
the family were not at home; but Jooste
scouted the Idea. Just then I heard. In
one of the neighboring apartments, a
his part of the world. There was, how
ever, nothing In the least malevolent In
these fifty-one stares; It was morbid fancy
only which made it seem that blank star
ing fell short of the real thing In cour
tesy. I was treated quite as well as the
customs of the place demanded. I was at
the Boer court, and was experiencing eti
quette n la Kruger.
Yet now I recall that ordeal with some
thing of a shudder. I have met a great
may kings in my dayâ black kings, white
kings, and yellow ones. Monarchs of many
kinds have I bowed toâ millionaires, po
litical bosses, war lords and other mighty
mortals. But I confess cheerfully that
no king, kaiser or Congressman ever made
me feel so completely the nothingness of
my worthless self as did old Paul Kruger
over his pipe and bowl amidst his fifty
cowboy cronies. He commanded my dread
and admiration; he almost made me
rife that he 'is corrupt, that he has put
away vast sums, that his religion Is mere
ly a cloak for wickedness. That may all
be true: but I, tor one, have no evidence
to support that view, and I find that sach
stories emanate usually from a class of
people whose trade It Is to rely mainly
upon money for their influence. I do not
believe Kruger Is corruptâ l do not believe

period of eight days. April 1 Is the
octave of March 25, and the last day
of a festival octavo was always marked
by the greatest abandon and festivity.
At the New Year season especially all
sorts of wild, mirthful pranks were In
dulged In, and of these It is believed that
our April fool usages - were a part.
Origins of a religious nature have been
boldly claimed for April Fools' day by
many writers. An old English antiquary,
writing In 1753. states that the custom of
imposing upon and ridiculing people on
the Ist of April may have an allusion to
the mockery of the Savior of the world
by the Jews. Something like that which
we call making April fools Is practiced
also abroad in Catholic countries on In
nocents' day, on which occasion people
run through all the rooms, making a pre
tended search in and under the beds. In
memory, I believe, of the search made by
Herod for the discovery and the destruc
tion of the child Jesus and of his having
been imposed upon and deceived by the
wise men, who, contrary to his orders
and expectation, "returned to their own
country another way."
When the early Britons were Induced to
forsake' their Druidical priests and Idols
and to embrace Christianity, It was their
custom" for many years after to annually
hold in their churches at the commence
ment of April a great festival, resem
bling the Roman Saturnalia, at which
they indulged in a thousand ridiculous
and indecent ceremonies, gambols and
dancing grotesquely to ludicrous anthems.
These singular observances referred to the
exploded pretensions of the Druids, whom
this ' festival was designed to hold up to
scorn and derision. That there Is no more
effective weapon than ridicule was again
proved In this case, for this feast of fools
""Whence proceeds the custom of making
April fools? Answer: From a memorable
transaction happening between " the
Romans and the Sabine.3, mentioned by
Dionysius. Which was thus: The Romans,
about the Infancy of their city, wanting
wives, and finding they could not obtain
the neighboring women by their peaceable
addresses, resolved to make use of strata
gem, and accordingly Romulus instituted
certain games to be performed in the be
ginning of April (according to the Roman
calendar) in honor of Neptune. Upon no
tice thereof the bordqring Inhabitants,
with their whole families, flocked to Rome
to see this mighty celebration, whereupon
the Romans seized a number of the Sablna
virgins and ravished them, which imposi
tion, we suppose, may be the foundation
of this foolish custom." This most absurd
and wholly unjustifiable account of the
origin of making April fools is thus ridi
culed by a poet of the time:
Ye witty tiparks who makes pretense
To answer questions with good sense.
How cornea.it that your monthly Phoebus .
Is made a fool by Dionysius?
For had the Sablnen, as they -came,
D-partpd with their, vlrirln fame.
The Romans had been Jtyled dull tools,
"And they, poor Rlrls. been April Fools.
Therefore. If this be" n't out of season, -Â¦â¢'Â¦;;
Pray, think and give a better reason.
Some old folk-writers claim that our
April Fool customs are attributable to the
fact that the year formerly began, as to
come purposes and in some respects, on
the 25th of March, which was supposed
?o be the day of Our Lord's incarnation.
At that time' it was customary for all
festivals to continue for an octave, or

"The first of April lome do say.
TVoa Â«et apart for All Fools' Day;
But why the people call It Â«o.
Nor I nor they therr.reUes do know."
Thus an old English poet sings truly,
for It would be a hard matter to find any
one who can give an accurate and correct
account of how the Ist of April came to
be known as All Fools' day and of the ori
gin of the custom pertaining to It of then

A learned antiquary, writing in 1599,
claims that our April Fools' day Is but a
continuation of the Qulrinalla, or feast of
fools, bf the ancient Romans. In- "The
British Apollo." a most ingenious work
published !n 17C8. I find the following:Adam and Xoah, Methusaleh and Solcv
rnon. Moses and the Apostles wero all
hopelessly confused In Bill's recitals of
the 'events which go to make up biblical
history and with him the Feast of the
Passover and the Lord's Supper were woe
fully entangled.
But on one point Bill's mind was defin
itely fixed; he had long entertained the
notion that the parson had only served
bread and wine on the communion table
because he was pressed for cash and
couldn't afford anything more elaborate.
But Bill's purse was not. yet emptied of
his season's earnings and he generously
concluded that on communion Sunday
there should be a* spread the people would
remember for years to come.
.Hi 3 first communion Sunday. was In
truth the red letter day In the history of
Big Horn. Just as the lynching day was
the event indelibly recorded In the annals
of Sheridan.
The congregation assembled as nsnal
and Bill preached from the text. "It Is L
be not afraid." He dwelt for some time
on the events attending the creation, and
when he reached tha flood he told how
Solomon gathered together two of every
â¢ . Â°

t doors with sheep blood '. so the Lord
(wuddenf kill 'em wen he got hot about
'Faro. That's what I call lernin' some
thing, an' I got it all from the parson,
an' wot's good enough fer him Is a full
hand with Lariat Bill."
There was a strange hush over the con
gregation as Bill resumed his seat and
when the preacher took him by the hand
and offered up a prayer for the rude com
ing into the fold, there were several
others who came forward and the Rev.
Mr. Walt felt a greater satisfaction over
the penitents before the throne that night
than had ever come to him In the brief
period of his ministry.
After this Bill was almost constantly
with the parson. Hour by hour, he listen
ed to the reading of the word' and puz
zled over the mysteries of the Holy Writ,
which have puzzled many wiser heads
than hl3.
At times when a portion was perused
â¢which completely staggered Bill's under
standing he would break forth Into
streams of cjis3 words, before which h'<Â»
young preceptor bent as a tree in a gale,
â¢ but never once did he try to stem the tide
of Bill's profanity.
So Bill cursed this one and commiserated
that as his friend read their experiences
from the Book and the parson pursued his
task knowing the outcome was for good.
Finally, when the heavy snows threat
ened, the Rsr. Mlnot Walt left Big Horn
to return .to his Eastern home. To his
surprise Lariat Bill announced kl* Inten
tion of preaching to the Big Horn con
gregation until the spring round up when
necessarily his work would call him else
where. â¢
No congregation ever hung more atten
tively" on the words of a teacher than this
' one In Big Horn awaited the teachings cf
Lariat BUI.
Ha taught them much they could have
acquired In no dther way. In the past
few weeks Bill had been an earnest and
eagerly attentive listener, although hl.i
memory for dates and events proved to be
at times unreliable. Still. !n the main, he
did welL Beside tba Bible on the rough
pulpit ha was wont to place his two six
shooters pointing over the heads of his
hearers and on a nail at the side his lariat

down over the head and shoulders of the
offender, while Bill Jerked him into sl-

the herds of the plains, and gradual mi
grations led him stage by stage Into Wyo

threw them at hii visitor's feet. "Bos

Then he got Into th* saddle. He was
there only a moment, ltr aa he was about
to take a short bold of the reins, which
he had failed to do as he mounted, that
bristling back bowed upward suddenly
and the young preacher. I'Xe a shot from
a catapult, went straight up toward the
Â«ky trailing cloudless above him.
Either he was very light cr the bronco

barring explosions, never man tcok so ex

locked en unaffectedly. It was a com
monplace occurrence for him to witness,
for this particular Lronco was no - jÂ»d from

ever, something transpired which iwak

came toward one another with all the
force of a vigorous pair cf thighs unit

the sides of the bronco.
This time it was the bronco, as well as

he pondered over the occurrence tha
more he became convince^ that he had
been bunkoed, and that Boston was no

conviction he decided to look -up the miss

Meanwhile, about sundown the fourth
day. the Rev. Mlnot Walt had arrived at
the ranch of a low-browe<l, slow-speaking

Johnson â¢worked around the shack' for

of hoofs ami voices approaching the place.
Turning so he could see In the direction

uncertain light a half dozen or more cow

Johnson came up warily, and called for
him to come out. to which he responded
sleepily, then getting Into hi<! clothes,
wondering wbajrtt all meant, he emerged
from the hut. "Hands up:" called John

beheld a half dozen six-shooters pointing
menacingly In his direction. Up went his
hands and then he asked what It was all

he didn't quite believe it.. However, this
led them to temporize, and convinced that

didn't chow up It would be proof that
something was wrong and they'd hang
the parson anyway.
The parson was taken to Bhertdan and
the clx days dragged along wearily for
the accused. He read the little pocket
Bible he had with him, but he didn't
make any ostentatious show of his re
ligious pursuits.
Sundown of the sixth day came and no
Bill; then 7 o'clock, and It began to get
dark, and finally through the streets, or
rather the street, of the town there
wound a motley procession of cowboys
and gamblers and some of the better ele
ment to see a parson's feet fan the breeze
for snatching a bronco.
A lone tree, none too tall for the grew
some purpose, stood Just on tha out
eklrts of the town, and to this the crowd
escorted its victim.
Arriving at the tree, the spokesman told
the preacher to say anything he had to
cay, because they meant business, and
the man who took Lariat Bill's bronco
would have to swing.
For once in his life the Rev. Mlnot
Walt got down on his knees feeling that
between him and his Maker there was
only a dangling bit of rope. As he knelt
the cowboys gathered around him In a
semicircle, luridly lighted up by a blaz
ing lire of grass and branches which had
been hastily heaped together.
That row of faces the parson never for
get. On the outskirts of the crowd a new '
arrival made his presence known Just in
thetiick of time. Lariat Bill, astrfdtf an
crntty cream-colored cayuse, 'called out
to ktpw what was up, and as*he pressed
forward, not waiting for the dozens.' o-f
answe*B that came to his query, he cried:'
"Why, 'n' llghtnln', boys, that's
the gosjel cove that rode my bronco. He's
one of li. he Is. and the man that dars'
say he's a thief, answers to Lariat Bill.
Ye bar mi," and regardless of the kneel
ing posture of the preacher he rushed
forward ani Jerked the man to his. feet,
telling the itory In his own picturesque
way to the fcrowd. Then there was a
wild yelling aad Bhootlng of gune and the.
Rev. Minot "\Jait said afterward that the
way he was borne around on the ehoul
der* of that fraatlc, hooting stream of hu
manity totally Â«cllpsed the great furor
over him the day, at Harvard when he
made the great kick to goal that saved
the 'Varsity clever from defeat.
A NOTABLE CONVERSION
-
blighting storms of profmn* vttsnas*
which would rattle tha paper on th* walls
of the barrooms.
The town hall served as a achoolhous*
and a church and a dance hall. When
â¢ service was held there, and sometimes
this was not oftener than once In three
months, the bar was concealed by a cur
tain and the preacher stood' on a little
platform In front of It.
The Rev. Mr. Wait held Beveral meet
ings in the little hall. The fourth night
Bill attended. He sat back by the big
cast-iron stove in the rear of the hall
and every few minutes, as the preacher's
words went out to his listeners, a stream
of tobacco Juice was ejected from between
Bill's lips and striking the red hot stove
sent up dense clouds of steam, accom
panied by a hissing as . of a hundred
snakes let loose.
Swlsh-sso-sss-sss, with unvarying mo
notony, of degree and kind, BUI kept up
his aqueous fusillade until suddenly he
was Jolted out of * his revery by these
words: ; VThere" are chairs In hell hotter
'than that stove, brother. Be warned fn
time that one of them ls'not. for- you."
"Every one looked around-, expecting to
hear' something hot from Bill, but Instead
of that, he * got up slowly and walked
forward four or" five rows of benches and
Â¦at down. Then, uneasyl-ike, he rose again
The parson was the hero of tha hour;
the only man In Wyoming who had ever
bestrode Bill's bronco an hour at a
stretch, and a tenderfoot to boot. The Big
Horn Sentinel, o%*er in Big Horn, less than
twenty-live miles distant, expressed a pro
found disbelief in the statement. This, of
course, was- accounted for by the petty
â¢Jealousy existing between the rival towns;,
but when Mr. Walt preached several times
In Sheridan, having In his congregation
every "resident of the place. Lariat Bill
rode with him over to Big Horn.
In front of the .little o.ne-story rough -
board building where the Sentinel was la
boriously printed on a slpw hand press,
Bill refned .In his. bronco .and the editor
came out. Bill remarked.. "Ther wuz a
piece in yer paper abeutthe parson's not
riding Bill's bronco. Did yer know that
Lariat Bill SED he rode it? Yer didn't?
Wall. I thought. so. Ye har me: The par-
Eoh rode the â¢ bronco, andâ ye know the
rest," and Bill's hand worked nervously
about his belt. Then he rode along, thÂ«
parson following. The next day the Sen
tinel came out with Its regular weekly '
budget of news, and in prominent type on
the first page the editor mentioned the
circumstance of the parson's wonderful
performance and entirely repudiated the
statement that had appeared .the preced
ing week.
Leather Made of Fish Skins
That Proves Durable.
The United States Fish Commission r*- '
cently has been getting together a coCeoÂ».
tlon of leathers made from tha aklss of
fishes and other aquatla animals. It Is:
not only of interest to tha cmtositjH
seeker, but Is Intended to have a very,
practical value, showing Incidentally;
what may be dona with the outer coats .
of many creatures whose hides ar* com
monly esteemed worthless. Already thÂ«
worlds supply of leather derived froia;
land animals does not equal the demand. ;
so. that the utmost efforts are being raids.
to discover cr manufacture soxn* sort of j
available substitute, but hitherto nobody]
seems to have thought of utilizing tfc*
material afforded by creatures that Uv*
In the water.
Several kinds of fishea bar* gSsSam that!
make excellent leather for sonia inniinaas. !
For example, salmon hide serve* so well
'In this way that the Esquimaux of
Alaska make waterproof shirts and boots
out of Itâ in fact, even whole suits of
"clothes. They also cut Jackets out of,
codfish skins, which are very â¢*rrlceab]Â«
garments. Already frogskins art cooing.
Into use for the mounting of books vhtrÂ« 'Â¦
â¢an exceptionally delicate material for
fine bindings Is required.
Whaleskln would mak* aa adzsirsit*
leather for some purposes, and It ta %
shame to think of the countless thousands!
of hides of these cetaceans that h*vÂ» b**a,
thrown away since the fishmc for tfcasai
began. Porpoise leather Is even now Â«sj-'
ployed for razor strops, being considered!
a very superior material. Seal leather,
dyed In a number of different colors, is'
Included In the, Flah Commission's eoi-j
lection.
Hair seals are still enormously ptanilfnl.
In the North Atlantic and other seas, andJ
It is not difficult to kill them, bo that they
afford a very promising source of leather
supply. Walrus leather has come Into ta*
market recently, but It will hardly amount
to much commercially. Inasmuch as th*>
animals are being rapidly exterminated.
Another kind of leather now coming Into â¢
the market Is that of the sea elephant. â¢
Up to within a few years ago a Â«pedes of'
sea elephant was found on the Padfia
Coast, ranging as far north as Lower'
California, but It has been entirely ex-1
terminated. A related species occurs la

When Bill had finished h!s sermon hÂ»
drew aside the curtain that concealed ths
bar and to the wondering gaze of his
auditors there was exposed Bill's first
Lord's supper. And they all went forward'
on his Invitation and part c ok of sand
wiches and canned sardines and potted
.meats and all kinds of plain ar.d fancy
drinks, without money and without price. ,
BUI stood behind the bar. serving every
one who came and seeing that no ono
went hungry. After a time, looking to-;
ward the outer door. Bill saw "an Indian'
standing looking longingly at the feast
ers. ' â¢>â¢ * ,
At first he reached for h!s gna. then;
he thought of what the parson had told!
him â that salvation' was free to all â and !
he motioned the redskin to draw near. .
rhls the Indian did hesitatingly. He was
White Horse, chief of the Montana
Crows. White Horse was undeniably
hungry, and as he came forward Bill
talked to him about religion and ths Â¦
Lord's supper, acd gave him all hÂ» could'
eat and all he could drink of probably thÂ»
worst firewater that ever' passed down,
an Indian's, gullet. .â¢ .- '
Nearly every one else was drtrr.Jt. ffcnaTl ;

when he did he'emittfd a whoop that
raised the hair of his hearers. Then hÂ»
staggered out of the dpor .muttering: ;
"White Horse, grer.i chief. Catch na (
lig*n. He go tepee, give llg'n to squaw."
Up at the tepee outside the town Me-;
wokwos was lying on the dirty blankets
which constituted the common bed..
White Horse, whooping elatedly now and'
Â¦ gain, approached irregularly, opened thÂ»,
flnsp entrance of the tepee and staggered ,
In. He' pulled the. clothes off Me-;
wokwos and said: "White Horsa been
church; ketchum llg'n: give squaw plen
ty." And he lifted hjs arm and brought
down a big leather tug with terrible forca
on the half-naked form of his squaw.
When he had repeated thlsi several times:
the whisky entirely overcame him and ha
fell Into a drunken stupor. ?
One day in the great spring roond-np
Bill lariated a mad bull that was con-Â«
Usually fighting and stampeding th> herd. :
|As the lar'.at settled over the animal's
shoulders Bill Jumped from the saddle :
and left his bronco to bring thÂ« trail In. â¢
While thus dismounted and seme distance
from his pony, something frightened tha:

Though thus rudely torn frÂ«a Ms efeos

picturesque, was lasting. For many year*'
thereafter when occasional missionaries
would stop at the Custer agency to worJc

History of the People of the
United States.
In his fifth volume Professor John Bach
McMaster deals with a period of our his
tory between 1821 and 1830. -which In many
of its phases has received but scant at
tention. The close of Mor.rce's term, the
administration of John Qulncy Adams
and the stormy opening years of Jackson.
form an epoch of peculiar interest in view
of the development of the democratic
spirit, the manifestations of a new Inter
est In social problems, the experiments in
banking and finance, the improvements
in the conditions of city life, the chang
ing relations between the East and West,
and the author's full and striking presen
tation of the literary activity of the coun
try at that time.
Professor Mcllaster's volume opens
v.-ith a chapter on the "Karly Settlement
of Texas" by Austin and his imitators,
and on th."> origin and first temporary set
tlement of the Oregon dispute by the es
tablishment cf the line 54 degrees 40 min
utes. It was in connection with this line
that Adams announced to Russia the anti
colonization part of the Monroe doctrine.
The second chapter, therefore, under the
caption "Growth of the Monroe Doc
trine," reviews the gradual development
and assertions of the three principles of
that doctrine from Washington's day to
1525; the Holy Allies and their work In
Europe, their preparation for Interference
with the late Spanish-American colonies,
and the filial assertion of the doctrine of
Monroe. After thus reviewing the im
portant foreign relations of Monroe's sec
ond term, Mr. McMaster returns to do
mestic concerns, and in" the next chapter
treats of "The Breaking L'p of the Re
publican Party." The economic, industrial
and political conditions which led to sec
tionalism, ihe rise of the rival condidates,
and the long Presidential campaign, end
ing- in the failure of the colleges to elect,

The election of Adams marked the end
of the first half-century of the republic.
The next 'eight chapters are, therefore,
riven' up io an examination or review of
certain social, political, literary and In
dustrial conditions which arose during the
period and paved the way for the triumph
of Jackson and Democracy.*; Â¦>â¢'*-Â¦
In the chapter on "Socialistic and Labor
Reforms' we have the story of the en
trance of the workingman Into politics;
of tliat curious socialistic movement of
Owen and Fanny Wright: the beginning
of the Anti-Masonic party and the early
signs cf Native Ameril-anism. â¢
The next chapter is a full account of
the state of the country from IS2j to 1320;
the rapid growth of cities; early problems
In city government; the introduction of
gas and anthracite coal; the opening of
the Erie canal, and the tremendous strug-
Kue for Western trade, etc. Following
this is a chapter on "The Negro Prob
lem," and the next chapter, under tho
title "The Industrial Revolution," is an
account of the rise and development of
manufactures; of the conditions which led
to the tariffs of 1524 and 1S28; their pecu
liar characters; the violent opposition of
the South, and assertions of the State
rights doctrine of Calhoun and his party.
This is followed by an account of our
early literary efforts, which Is singularly
fresh, informing and interesting. There
is a chapter on "The Common Schools
During the First Half Century," and an
other, quite timely now. on" "British Criti
cism of the United States," setting forth
very fully why our fathers hated Great
Britain so heartily. Then follows an elab
orate review of political Ideas; a chapter
on, foreign complications; the Panama
Congress; the prevention of the Indepen
dence of Cuba by the United States In the
interest of the slave-holding States; the
Maine boundary dispute with ; Great Brit
ain; the Oregon agreement of 1527; and
finally a chapter on "The Triumph "of
Democracy." detailing "the famous strug
gle ending In the election of Jackson, the
removals from office, the attempt to buy
Texas, and the rise of questions concern
ing the Indian, the surplus, the public
lands and the right of nullification^ Many
phases of our history treated In this vol

first time, and several of them are of pe

To Prepare for Civil Service Ex

To enter the employ of the Government
has been the earnest desire of many a
young Californian. Countless numbers
have tried the examinations â some have
succeeded, many have failed. Uncle Sam
has always been considered the best of
employers. He pays regularly, gives fair
compensation, offers steady positions and
requires service not too severe and hours
not too long. The great difficulty lies In
obtaining civil 'service appointment, not
in holding the office after having oneÂ©

examinations to.be held, for determining
the eligibility of competitors for' positions

the mere fact of passing a successful ex
amination does not insure a place on
Uncle Sam's payroll. It means that the
candidate Is placed upon the list . of
eligiblcs for one yearâ after which time
he must take another examination to
again have an opportunity for appoint
ment. It means that If a vacancy should
occur In the class for which he stood trial
his name will have a chance according to
the percentage to his credit. On the other
hand, while a successful examination does
not necessarily mean appointment, a fail
ure to pass certainly means no appoint
mciit. Many a young person has failed
in these examinations simply for the
reason that he did not know upon what
particular studies he should devote his

the book is not laid aside until finished.
Anthony HopÂ« stands forth pre-eminent
ly In this etyle of literature. He always
has a jrood etory to tell and he has a
knack in the telling that keeps the mid
right oil In pood demand. The charm of
Hope is In his dialogueâ it Is to sparkling,
fo natural. And then his tales are always
fo plausibly Improbable that they attract
by their very extravagance. He can get
his characters Into the worst dtlemmas
and bring them out again by the most un
expected turns of the pen In a way quite
uiacuians.
Anthony Hope's latest romance is a long
novelette or short novel reciting the most
e-stounding; adventures of one "Captain
Dieppe." This little book Is one of those
rnldr.lsht oil-burners aforementioned.
Begin lr not until you have time- to finish
It. for finish It you will when once be
jrun. It it-counts the adventures of Cap
tain Dieppe, a French soldier of fortune,
who has jnst lost M.ooo francs through a
frustrated riot and has barely escaped
â¢serious trouble with the secret service.
The opening chapter finds the gallant cap
tain obliged, through the inclemency of
the veather. to stay his fugitive flight and
ta"..e refuge in the house of a stranger,"
tho castle of the Count of Fieramondl."
The Count himself Is In rather a peculiar
position. He arid his wife, having agreed
to Â£isagree. are living: in separate parts of
the oajrJe with a high partition erected to
out the quarters and grounds of each en
tirely apart. The captain is greeted most
Trarrr.ly by his lonely host, who takes a
fancy to him at first sl*ht, and is duly in
stalled in the Count's own apartments on
the border line of the hostile- territoryâ
the husband having changed his room
through a fancied.insult received from the
enemy. A- door connects this room with
a hall leading to the hostile quarter and,
of course, upon the very first night. the
captain, through curiosity and a yellow
cat, must open thl? portal for a peep'
within. At the end of the hall he catches
* glimpse of a startled and beautiful
â¢woman, who slams a door and disappear
ed, while Dieppe, in turn, beats a preci
pitate retreat. From this the author
works out a wondrous tale of gambling
propensities on the part of i ie Countess
es the cause of the family rupture and a
Fharper on her track to recover money
loaned her upon a recent trip to Monte
Carlo; of a secret service agent, who ap
pears on the scene to get valuable papers
In the possession of the captain, and of
plots and counter plots which arise from a
general misunderstanding all around.
What with good nchts. clever love-making
scenes and a certain element of attractive
mystery, the reader's Interest in kept at
the highest pitch throughout.
This is the first of a series of novelettes
â¢which the Doub!eday-McClure Company
have In contemplation. They Intend to
publish in this series stories which are
generally considered too short to make a
book of by themselves and are therefore
usually made to form the attraction in

also announce a new system, devised by
themselves, for the accommodation of out
of-town book buyers by which these
volumes will be sent to any address' on
approval, to be paid for if satisfactory,
or to be returned to them in case it is not

Candee. It is intended for the woman who
cither through choice or force of circum
stances Is obliged to earn her own livins
Â¦posslbly the living for several dependent
cr.es as well. In a brief introduction 'for
all workers" the author discusses in a
jrenera! way the Importance of deciding
upon the calling for which one is b^s-t
fitted, the necessity of giving up to a great
extent the social functions of life, -the
close attention that must be paid to p-.inc
tuallty and responsibility and a mention
of the difficulties in the path of the feml

Then follows a specific discussion on the

letter. , At the outset he Is !n danger cf
having the missive taken from him. and
has it hidden In a most ingenious way In
his coat of = mall. All sorts of machina
tion* are employed against him, some of
*uch perilous nature that It seems Impos
sible for Flamsteed to outwit the spies and
traitors. But he does so, and arrives be

tho letter. But this does not close tho
â¢scene, fey he must still play a part in the
incarceration of the unhappy Mary. She

rebellious lords. Advised to throw herself
without reserve upon the generosity of her
royal cousin, Ehe flnda herself a prisoner.

Everybody's Magazine for April con
tains many Interesting features. Th* sec
ond article In the series, "Great American
Industries," treats of the enormous steel
works of the Carnegie Company near
Plttsburg, Pa., and explains in what man
ner this company will make thi3 year
profits exceeding $40,000,000. The fourth In
the series of "Simple Explanations" takr>s
up a fascinating subject and one which
has undoubtedly been a mystery to nine
tenths of the magazine readers; that Is,
the method of navigating a ship by ob
servation of the sun and stars. For a
difficult mathematical subject this method
Is explained In a singularly lucid fashion,
and appears to be very simple after all.
A very strong article is that on "Our
Coast Defenses." which describe* tha
manufacture, emplacement and use of the
hugÂ« disappearing guns, the mortar bat
teries and coast defenses in general which
are now being pushed to completion on
both the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards.
The illustrations for this are new and In
teresting.
ThÂ» most striking feature of the April
East and West is a poem lome four
pages lore, by Madison Cawein. entitled
â¢The End of the Century." It id. perhaps,
the most distinguished single bl: of work
this poet has vet given the world. Hia
symbolical characterization of the Pres

the ghost-trains or the Past, Is remarka
ble for Its vividness and the appropriate
ness of lta suggestion. The lines:

emphasize the strange perversity of fat*
that has compelled our great century of
peace and progress to pass out In the
primal flare of war and wnld the world

tainly attract attention.

praiseworthy feature of this magazine.
An article on the Cape Nome (Alaska)
gold fields, also with a map. and one the
"Trans-Idthmlan Canals and Amer'.can

Moody has in his possession all of his

wish it was that his biography should bÂ«

A book which should be of lonw timely
Interest Is W. E. Simmons' volumo on

The book contains not only a detailed
history of the canal from Its Inception to

In view of the recent Hay-PauncefotÂ»

India Ink was declared to be sacrilegious
and its manufacture was prohibited.
Afterward it dawned upon the versatile
mind controlling the destinies of the Im
perial exchequer that there was great pos
sibilities of revenue in the production of
India ink. if Judiciously absorbed by Im
perial prerogative. Accordingly tho ban,
was removed from the offending Industry,
which revived quickly, though restricted
to the province of Kians-si and heavily
handicapped with an enormous trlbuta
exacted by the Emperor.
'Apparently there were millions in India
ink in those clays, for a sharp competition
in its production arose, and this was tha
beginning of trouble for artists ant
draughtsmen. The market was frluttel
with worthless grades. At first the ink
was superfine in quality, and the lamp
black used in it was ground into a
powder so fine that it was. as*
volatile as vapor and possessed In Itself
an odor of musk. Later, when competi
tion Corrupted Its production, coarser and
cheaper pigments were substituted for thÂ«
fine ones and the Ink was artificially per
fumed with musk in order to disguise Its
Inferiority.
The Chines* are passionately fonl of
musk, and India ink was u.Â«ed by them not
only as a writing material, but also as a
flavor for their choicest beverages. A lit

modern India ink can hardly be recom

day in Jamestown, for the prisoners will
be coming to town.
Among the prisoners Pieter Arnoldus
Cronje will be the center. The onlookers
will take In with greedy eyes one half
soldier, half farmer, all a man.
Pieter Arnoldus Cronje is at heart a
soldier, although he never received any
training other than that which he has ac
quired upon the field of battle. It has
been his lot since he was a young man
to do the defending and guarding of his
country against covetous hand?â his coun
try, mad*' rich and prosperous through
nevcr-falllnÃ energy, hard v/ork and per
severance. Small in stature and wearing
the proverbial beard of the Boers, Cronje
looks more a tiller of the soil than a sol
dier, and a tiller of the soil he is when
not engaged in war. He is simple In man
ner and address, unassuming and ever
rr.ir.rlirs his own affairs, but when lead
ing his troops he is another person. It
was Cronje the soldier; Cronje the leader,
who earned the title of "Lion of South
Africa."
He is a patriarch and rules his own lit
tle tribe, as is the custom in the Trans
vaal, in true biblical style and with ab
solute authority. His farm of 120,000 acre*
is near Potchefstroon. His house is of

vihich they will know no more. Then will
come flawing homesickness, the vrorst ol
all p'lmentrâ and this for the band of men
Â¦who hold at bay .in army of 50.000.
As Cronje sails to h!s prison placo he

Students of the University of California
Turn Actors to Pay College Debts.
Tlm Bwfeetey boya have had their wits to work taking

sen for tIM stocktakings a vary urgent one. Thsir cof
fers art Â«cnpty; tha treasury of the Associated Students
â¢f tha University of California is depleted, and unless
prompt measures arÂ« taken the activities and festivities
of the caller* are in danger of being Indefinitely sus
pended.
Tha Berkeley students have risen to tha occasion.
They will present a three-act : farce entitled "James
Wobberts. B. S. Boston," at the Grand Opera-house on
Saturday afternoon, April 17. and will continue tha per
formance during the week.
Tha boys are not to have lt|all their own way. Fair
co-cds are going to assist. Four young- lady students
have roles in the farce, and the cast is Interesting be
cause of the fact that never before have the girl stu
dents participated In any entertainment given before
metropolitan audiences either in Stanford or Berkeley
performances. Chaperons will be much in demand, and
solicitous relatives will be in attendance, but the Berke
ley maids will tread the boards and win the applause
with their brothers. -.:' .'V:- .
The play was written by Richard "Walter. Tully, a
Junior student, who will appear In the cast, and al
though originally composed with a view to college audi
ences It Is calculated to draw the appreciation of a gen
eral public. . T/" ;: 1 .
Tom Harrington, a typical "sporty" collegÂ© man. Is
the character about whom the plot revolves, and the
three acta are replete with complication. Having a. very
dubious record as a student, he is posing before his
father as the leader of his classes, and is threatened with
an embarrassing situation when he receives notice of a
visit from his father. ' .When ' his : father arrives Tom,
wltfi tha assistance of a friend, induces a verdant fresh
man. James Wobberts, 8. 8. Boston, to pose as a pro
testor whÂ» Is expeoted to arrive and to speak creditably
of Tom's progress. The arrival of the real professor
upsets this scheme, and further confusion is brought
about by tha appearance of a miner and his daughter
from San Francisco, whom Tom had met the night be
fore in the assumed character of an officer of the regular
army. In a hopeless endeavor to keep up his several per
sonalities the ingenuity 6t Tom is much taxed, and the
difficulty of keeping them from. putting heads together
brings about endless complications. The pseudo-profes-
For tries to reveal his identity, but is silenced as a luna
tic, and a chance remark to the effect that Tom has
"cut gym"â an innocent term for having given up the
gymnasium â leads every' one to believe that Tom has
been in a. fight. The wild efforts ot young Harrington,
to keep people from getting together and making ex
planations result in partial success and all is going well
until the reappearance of the real professor, who has
succeeded in reaching the ear of the faculty, frustrates
everything, and Tom gives himself up as lost. He ia
saved, however, through the limited vocabulary of a
Japanese boy, whose English is confined to the one word
"yis." Tom ingenibusly weaves a fabrication and gets
the affirmative support of. the Jap. Vindication follows
and the farce enda happily. The plot is laid in a college
boarding house, and the tricks of the college youth, toÂ»
gether with the difficulties of the landlady, -are comically
introduced. The cast Is as follows:

Suddenly .the dreadful winter landscape
disappeared. The , grim pines became
pillars of gold. Sof V, carpets' like those
that the Venetian merchants brought
from .their most distant voyages stretched
before the brothers, where- all before had
been ghastly snow.* Instead of the cold

those of "Arabia filled, tho atn^osph'ere. It
was no longer La Verna cold and cruel,
the refuge of bandits and- murderers, but
a splendid palace ..like "that of â¢ Solomon.-
And the two- brothers found themselves
extended on downy couches.' ', Before them
a table appeared, bearing the most deli-,
clous -dishes â wines to gladden the hearts
.of connoisseurs and fruits of wonderful
lusclousnessâ all served In golden plates
and the finest, rarest crystal. The table
was covered with Bilk, rich, with" superb
embroidery. Surely no Oriental monarch
ever* offered to his guests a repast more
splendid. The sound of harp* and flolins
tilled the 'air, while a host of beautiful
women clothed in long white drosses,
with- floating hair 'and crowns of gaily
colored flowers, awaited the orders of the
astonished brothers.
â¢ Brother Leo quickly extended his hand
toward one of Jlhe golden cups," but Broth
er Francis stopped him:
' "Oh, my brother." he said, "do not
hasten to quench . thy thirst from this

Brother Leo. "we hava here nothing

declares Itself In this magnificence." And
again he extended his hand toward tha
golden cup, but again Brother Francis ar
rested him. "Brother Leo," ha said sadly,
"beware! Tha devil has many resources
for snatching souls."
Brother Leo answered. **I ana so
thirsty!" "No matter." said Brother
Francis, "It Is sweet to suffer thirst for
the love of God." "I am so hungry,"
Â¦aid Brother Leo. At this moment <\
large, luminous cross appeared on th-i
wall before Brother Francis and & hand
of fir* wrote beneath It: "Infinite ami
multifold Is the goodness of God." Then
Brother Francis recognized tha hand that!
had warned Balthazar and his heart wan
assured, ' Ha fell on his knees, rendered
thanks and said to his companion, "Very
well. Brother Leo, since such Is th* will
of God, we may do honor to this repast."
However, he remained sad at heart. Dry
bread and clear water, such was the re
past that he had hoped to receive from
Ood. This extravagant luxury shocked
and grieved him.-'
The beautiful women began to serrw do
repast, presenting exquisitely delicious
viands. Fish of silver sheen In golden
sauces, roasted peacocks garnished In
their plumes, game of all sorts, grspes
as large as nuts and a. hundred other
fruits coming from the four quarters o2
the world. .Â»
Brother Leo at* with & rlgorcms appe
tite. Brother Francis himself, his palat*
excited by the good things, regretted less
the dry bread and water that ha had
longed for. The wine of which they par
took In prudent moderation warmed their
blood and comforted their poor frozen
bodies. They finally fell asleep, lulled by
the gentle music- of the celestial harps.
"When they awoke they found them
selves .on the side of Mo/unt .Verna. not
far from the first fir trees which crowned
the summit.
"Oh, Brother Francis,*' said Brother
Leo, "what a delightful experience wa
have had! And it was not a dream, for
I feel neither hunger nor thirst, and my
members are supple and light like after
a good repose.
But Brother Francis remained standing,
leaning on his staff and plunged la a pro
found meditation.
"O Lord, blessed be thy name." he
said in hfs heart, "for Brother Leo was
dying and behold you have saved him.
"We were hungry and thirsty and you
gave us food and drink. "We were weary
and you gave us repose. But why. O
Lord, by such means? "Why those deli

the music, the women? You could hava

For a long time Brother Francis pon
dered In this manner, tormented by tha
question that he could not answer.
Brother Leo pulled; his mantle, urging him
to hurry. "Hasten thou. my brother." ha
said to him*, "we have our duties at tha

Brother Francis did hot answer, bnt re

Brother Loo stopped to catch his breath
.ttv.<l. leaning heavily on his staff, said
with a weary eigh:

"My dear brother, forgive the feebleness

hardly audible, "but it seems to me at

be a supper and a warm bed."
Then Brother Francis sighed heavily,
and while they continued to climb the
mow-covered mountain he meditated on
the error of men who think the needs of
nature real and important when nothing
Is of consequence but the needs of the
soul. "Behold. Brother Leo," he eald to
himself, "one of the best of our congrega

Dr. Elliott Coves. the famous ornitholo
gist an.i member of tiid National Academy
of Sciences, who died recently, was long
recognized as the foremost advocate of
brlief in the existence of ghosts. He had
premised several of hi=* friends that, if
nble to do r-'d, he would appear to them
after hi* own der.-'fce, and now they are
waiting with.', rib little interest to see if he
will carry cut the agreement.
"I have myself seen the ghests of a good
many dead persons," paid the doctor to
ti.e writer one day. "I remember one oc
casion when I had just gone to bed. the
litjht uelng turned nut. i was conripo?ins
myself to sleep, when I suddenly became
aware of a presence in the room. The Im
pjresfrion cuveyed to my mind was that it
wns the presence of a certain person lately
fVceaseo, with whom I had been on very
intimate terms; In fact, I felt an overpow
ering sense, of the nearness of the individ
ual in rue-ticn. At about the Fame mo

nebulous mas:-r of what looked like shin
lifliE white Â¦vaiio.rv v.hich began J to take

distinct V-itllrie . until it. prestnied a ; rS

â¢peared . to.move,- and from them came an
intelligible utterance â a message. In short,
from the departed. I do not care to say
what the 'message was, but I can assure
you that the vision was no dream, and the
nature of the message was such as to
eliminate, to my own satisfaction, at all
events., the theory of. hallucination. What.
then, was this . shape . oi â¢ shining white

question pregnant with much Interest.
"Every afternoon," continued the doc
tor, "at about s'o'clock I'lie down on the
sofa in my library tor a brief rest before
sdousness projected objectively, as It
were, so that my conscious self stands out
In the room and views my body lying on

light, which crows gradually until It has
filled all the room, and my conscious self
finds* Itself surrounded by phantoms, most
of them of persona who appear to be
strangers to me. while others resemble
ncciualntances who nave been long dead.
They seem to walk about and converse
in the ordinary way. although not audibly.
All the time I am clearly aware of the

I feel myself on the sofa again. It la, ob

that they arc in a sense substantial and
possess h semi-material structure. If you

refer for illustration to the ether whiclj
Is understood to occupy all space. It has
waies of known lengths and measured

In.short. we knn^r a good deal about this

semi-material. I have no notion of the
nature of the substance that makes a
ghost, but I suppose that when a man
dies it separates itself from tne grosser
particles that compose his physical organ
ism. The latter decomposes, but the spir
itual part of the . individual does not
necessarily share that fate, being com

of this interesting subject the chief and

â¢*". If in t\X\* of one of
trim the ereatesf of,
tt Xf the Mexican g<?n
#Â£V ft erals. The military
y\ career of General
>A Diaz is most romantic
\s| and picturesque, a
career punc tuated
with adventure, ad
â¢ v.-rsity and success.
Even as a youth
Diaz displayed his passion for war. Born
In Oaxaca of an Indian mother and Span
ish father, his early training, through the
death of his father, was left to his Indian
mother. Porfirio Diaz easily ruled his
schoolfellows. While yet a youth he
clerked in an inn. later Riving this up to
prepare for priesthood and abandong idea
to study law.
The invasjon of the country by the
American army under. General Winfield
Eeott gave Diaz an impetus toward mili
tary service, although f> his bitter disap
pointment his company was made a hove
guard. Nothing" daunted in his deslrj for
actual fighting: he joinr-d Herrera In the
successful revolt against Santa Anna. Diaz
fought in this with such 'bravery that he
waa made Jefe of Tehuantepre, an im
portant position for a man of 27 year:-.
. The exigencies? of war shifted the tent
of government to Vera Cruz. In defending
Oa.xaca. his old home, from an attack by
the revolutionists Diaz was L>a:liy wou.-.d
ed. Almost fainting fro:>i loss of bl^otl.
he war carried iipqn tht shoulder* of li.j
BQldiers and continued the direction pi ifce
battle to- a Â¦â¢successful conclusion. .' "[
For thisf Diaz: .w;is Kiven it seat In the
National Assembly. When, General Mar-
Quez threatened the town. Diaz was. made
a brigadier and ordered to take charge of
the defense and destroy the conservative
army. For two months he/stormed the.
town occupied by the enemy, only to meet
with defeat owing to the overwhelming
force of the conservatives. General Diaz,
thanks to his superb, horsemanship; es
caped capture.-
From the landing of the French troops
In 1862 until the execution of Maximilian
Diaz bore the brunt of Ijis country's
struggle. When Pueblo w ! as captured by
the French Diaz refused to give his parole
with the other officers, and, escaping, re-,
organized the army, taking command as
commander in chief.
When the so-called monarchy was re
stored Diaz steadily annoyed the French
troops, avoiding pitched battles and en
deavoring to tire out the invaders. At
Oaxaca Diaz was defeated after a defense
that Is memorable- in the history of
battles.
The final withdrawal of the French
troops and the return of Juarez, the long
exiied President, gave Diaz a moment's
breathing spell before his struggle for the
Presidency began. Of the military tactics
of Diaz it has been said: "His character-,
lstic moves were the night march and
daybreak assault. In all his military
career It was the case that the other man
did not get up quite early enough."
One of the most exciting incidents. In
this life so replete with dangers owed its
successful denouement 'to the courage of
a-' San Franciscan, Mr. Alexander Coney,
â¢who for years has been .the Mexican Con
sul:' General of this city. At that time Mr/
Coney .was' purser on a ship anchored at
Vera Cruz. -General Diaz had just re
turned to -Vera.' Cruz after a short visit
to the .United States. Hi3 -presence did
hot please the opposition, who feared he
had some new .plan on foot to seize the
Presidency. After their. fashion, they de
termined to make away with Rim.
:'Diaz was pursued .to the water's edge
and to escape capture .plunged in and was;
eeemlngly swallowed by the waves.- An
hour or two -afterward Purser Coney
found . a Â¦ dripping â¢ object huddled
under the blankets In his stateroom.'
Diaz told, his .story' and Purser Coney
agreed to hide him aftd do everything
within his power. : Officials were search-.
Ing all the jships in 'the harbor to. make
sure that Diaz was not on board.
Those were anxious . days for P.urser
Coney : and General 'Diaz.' To keep the
fugitive concealed and fed without at--'
tracting attention was a difficult task for
Mr. Coney. There is a stronger bond
than the mere official one existing be
tween Consul Coney, and President Diaz.
President Diaz is . -not a man .who lets a
favor Blip his memory"..
The present .Yaqui trouble has again
â¢de Mexico a theater of war. But, ac-
Slng to those who ought to know, it
been, grossly exaggerated. "The
dquea out of mischiefs way. It was a den
rerous game, but he held tho winning
cards. One or two of the caciques aro still
alive In the City of Mexico, and, bent with
years, they nre living reminders of this
coup d'etat of Diaz. This corralling of ihe
caciques Is little known, and yet It waa
the most important step toward progress,
for It made way for the unification of tho
Â¦warring districts into one compact nation.
Since his election to the Presidency, over
twenty years ago, Diaz has fought the
battles in the warfare of commerce
and reform. Before -that he
fought for his Â¦ ,
ance, which In reality amount* to very
little."
Diaz says In his letter that h* still feelÂ«

strife, peril and adventure

iTc relations Diaz has been singularly
happy. His first wife, the daughter of a
Mexican planter and mother of all
three of his children, died years
a?o. After her death he remained a
Tfiaov/er for many years. In IS^S ho tv l3
married to his present wife. Carmen

dent's fiercest political enemy, BenoÂ»
Romero Rublo. This union established
their friendship and did raorÂ» to
bring: about peace between warring
factions than a dozen revolution*
could have accomplished.
The presidents wife is very
much beloved by all classes.
Beautiful, highly educated and
gracious. Dona Carmelita. as sha
is called, has been wonderfully help

are married. Hi* eldest daughter. Amada,

T ' ONDON, March SLâ Russian activ

""What does it all mean and'wher* will

Just .the same speculation is acute. Thert

Henry. Norman, who has jiisi return?;!
from a trip to Russia. Is or.c. Bn't the
Associated Press learns that n* such view
is' taken by the British Fore:e--i OrnVr.
which during- the recent tnrabkms tim^
has s'.ztd up the international situation
with wonderful correctness.
The next few weeks may, perhaps. brln<
up a tremendous war. scare, but the fa
lient fact remains that Japan is not reafiy
for hostilities. 'Alarming telegram*, from
the Far East may Increase and muitlp.y
and Korea may seem to be- en' the verse
of-s.RCÂ«iaUon by Russia, tuVtr* cairn of
Downing street Is not likely to be dis

Korean matters nave. cx?en arranged by
treaty and Lord Salisbury does no; be
lieve that Russia intends to break the
treaties, though her relations with Japan
may become strained to a serious point.
If all this rumpus in the .Far East had
been postponed for another year there id
scarcely any doubt that war would be a
serious probability, but those having any
intimate knowledge of Japan's far-reach
ing naval projects and her recent state
of incompleteness do not hesitate to say
that Japan is not going to risk anything
until her plans are matured.
Japanese naval maneuvers in the com
ing fall are to be carried out on an un
precedented scale and will partake mere
of the nature of a demonstration than cf
peaceful evolutions. Forty or more War
vessels are expected to be present in Jap
anese waters. The mcral effect of such
an ar^reratlon upon Far Eastern ques
tions Is causing ro little comment.
as iar as oreai Â¦tsn^ain is concerned.
Russia's military, rather than naval ac
tivity, is chiefly interesting, though the
press Is not yet allowed to take up its
cue In this matter. The Foreign Office,
while only faintly interested in Korea, be
ing practically sure that no serious trou
ble wil! result there, is devoting careful
investigation to the warlike preparations
occurring In South Russia.
There seems' no longer to be any doubt
that Turkey, for her tardiness to meet the
Russian demands regarding railway con
cessions, is being menaced by her .north
ern neighbor; and many signs point to the
fact that Russia intends to settle herself
In the northeast of Asia Minor, uniesa
Turkey gives In. Already a quarter of a
million of Russian trocps are maintained
on those borders, while the Black Â¦ Sea
squadron is ready for business, at a mo
ment's notice.
. 10 wr.ai cTcteni aritisa moral -assistance

the Russion" dfmar.ds Is a question which
at the present moment Is occupying Lord
Salisbury's .attention to an even greater
extent than the South African Â¦wax-. In
.view of the troubles of Great Britain in
South Africa, it is mere than probable
that Turkey will meet" the demands and
that the Russian troops will be wlth-
me scare anent Russian troops concen
trating In Afghanistan apparently arose
Â¦from this movement in the direction of
Turkey In Asia Minor, and Afghanistan
has passed into the categ-ory of peaceful,
uninteresting spheres.
With all these reports, to say nothing of
continued rumors of Bulgaria's desire to
throw off Turkey's suzerainty and become
a vassal .of the Czar, It is evident that
while Russia Is observing in the latter her
promise to England not to Interfere In
South Africa, she is not Idle in taking ad
vantage of opportunities* in every quarter
of the globe. For the peace of the world,
it is reassuring to remember that the fixed
policy of Russia for years has been to
take matters almost to the point' of hos
tilities and then to settle diplomatically,
the only exception cf this in modern times
being the Crimea, when the tone of the
peace party In England led her to believe
that the country would not interfere.

she was accompanied by the Prince Consort, who died seine two years later. H*r Majesty had made twp previous visits
to Ireland. The first in IS-4D, twelve years after she ascended the throne; the second four years later, in liS3. when she
made a more extended stay. On each occasion her every appearance in public was erected by the greatest enthusiasm
on the part cf the people. And the entire absence of anything; of an unfriendly nature at once gave jjreat pleasure ta
the roots Queen, and reSected credit on the manhood and chivalry for which Ireland has always been famous."
LOXDOX. March 31. â The Life Guards, couriers, carriages, pots and pans and other royal
paraphernalia have already gone to the Emerald Isle, which eagerly waits for Queen Vic
toria to follow. How Her Majesty will be received and the prospects of her doings in Dub
lin have quite overshadowed all other topics, even in a week which has been marked by the an
nual inter- varsity boat race, the resignation of the Duke of Norfolk as Postmaster General, the
announcement of the Delagoa Bay Railroad -award, and the rumors of possible war in the Far
East. Great Britain's own war in South; Africa has almost been forgotten; so uninteresting has
been the progress of peace in the Orange Free State compared with the stirring accounts of bat
tles which the British people had grown accustomed .to read daily. Â¦ ' '
ihe Oueen is said to oe m excellent health and well. able to bear the strain of the trip to
Ireland. She commences her journey April 2 and sleeps on board the royal yacht Victoria and
Albert, landing at Kingstown April 4. In anticipation of her Majesty's . progress . through the
city the streets of Dublin are already gay with flags and decorations. .
.: A "curious teature ot the preparations at the viceregal Lodge, where the yueen will stay,
are the pots and pans already referred to. Her Majesty is* tremendously particular about her
kitchen arrangements, and those at the Viceregal Lodge were found to be quite below the
royal -standard. Consequently no less, than 300 copper fricaudeau pans, eighty-four saucepans,
fifty .copper stock pots and many other varieties of cooking utensils have been sent to Dublin
especially ior the visit. ;- : . . :-:-:-. = ..:. . . â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢â¢".

i-iowever, though the yueen 15 said to. be lull ot excitement and enthusiasm m regard to her
approaching visit, she is not forgetful of South Africa. A story is going the rounds that the
Queen remarked that she was aware many people imagined her anxiety about the war would
cause her death. ''I may die." added her Majesty, "but it will be from some other cause. I do
not mean to let Mr. Kruger kill me." ' ;Â¦ \
VALOR OF RAW TROOPS
IN TAKING THE KOPJES
BLOEiif o>it-i>. Jiarcn sl â me Â±*ocr
position yesterday wa3 one of great nat
ural strength. Only the turning movement
of General French and Major Le Gallais.
the latter commander of the mounted in
fantry, oa either flank Insured the British
success.
The shape of the kopjes was irregular.
The Boers" right flank consisted ot a long
hill with wooded sides, connected with the
main position by a long, low ridge,, thick
ly wooded. The rest of the position, to
ward the left, consisted of broken kopjes,'
ail connected by a high ridge.
Major Le Gallais moved around the
Boers" left and engaged them, first freely
using his Vickers-Maxlms . and gradually
forcing the Boers toward the center,
where thfey made a good stand.
Major Le Gallais was unable to move
until late- in the day. while General French
moved early. The latter made a wide de
tour toward the rear of the" Boers, but
was unable to complete the movement be
fore the Boers perceived this Intention and
abandoned the position. They retired la
good order between General French and
Major Le Gallais. where the main body of
the Boers-, with four guns, held an excel
lent position on the edge of a deep donga,
whence they shelled General French.
i.ne lniantry attacK w-as ceijTered at
midday, when the Norfolks opened the
fight by seizing the lower slopes of aa
ugly kopje. Steadily they worked their
way to the crest of the hill, where a hot
engagement ensued. The Lincolnshires
occupied the hill on the right, protecting
the Eighteenth Battery, which dragged its
guns up the hill with the greatest difil
culty and opened a heavy fire at close
range. ...â¢-;.
Meanwhile the City Imperials. Â¦ getting
in touch with the Boers, the remainder of
inker's division advanced across a semi
circular basin, through which a railway
ran. It was very open ground, and the
Boers, from the detached kopje and ridge^
delivered a heavy fire. In spites of thi3.
however, the- British moved on steadily,
as' if oh parade. The advance was pro
tected by guns which vtgorotxsty shelled
the Boer positions. About 4 o'clock the
British advanced simultaneously and- oc
cupied the Boers' position^ from which an
excellent view could "be had of Brandfort,
fifteen miles distant across the open plain.
The Boer loss Is unknown.

SUCCESS OF FRUIT
ASSOCIATION ASSURED
Vice President Henry States That
Seventy-Five Per Cent of the
Growers Have Signed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN^JOSE. March 31.â The California
Cured Fruit Association is a grand success
and will control the output of this year's
prune crop. Such is the glorious news for
the prunegrowers given out this evening
by Vice President J. H. Henry. The 75 .per
cent necessary to make the association
active has been secured, and it is expected
that at least 15 per cent more of the prune
acreage will have been signed before the
crop is ripe. This means that the handling
of the prune crop will be taken out of the
hands of Eastern speculators, and the
fruit men may fix a fair price for the
product. : :"â¢
Vice President Henry states that the
California Cured Fruit Association has
now under its control 31,000 acres of
prunes, which, estimating one and a quar
ter tons of cured fruit to the acre, gives
It control of 35.775 tons, or 77,735,000 pounds
COMMISSIONER
PECK FLOODED
WITH PROTESTS
Urged to Close the American
Exhibits at Paris on
Sundays.
Should the Petitions From His Coun
trymen Be Heeded the French
Government Would Be
Offended.
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Press.
PARIS, March 31.â The important ques
tion whether the American and British
Eections of the exposition shall be open
on Sundays loomed up this week, engag
ing the serious attention of both the
American and British Commissioners,
upon whom pressure is being brought to
bear by. sections of their respective coun
trymen to close their exhibits. United
States Commissioner General Peck's mail
has l>KÂ£tught a big batch of protests on this
subject, based Chiefly upon re'igious scru
ples, and the Commissioner Unds himself
upon the horns of a dilemma, as the closure
of the American section on what will be
the most popular visiting day of the week
certainly will not meet with favor from
Frenchmen. The situation was Â»different
in the case of the Chicago World's Fair,
whon the United States, in its own house,
could do as it pleased; but here both the
American and the British commissions
feel that they are in the position of guest 3
and are expected to conform to the cus
toms of the country. ' The British Com
mission has received an official Intimation
from its Government to go a? far as pos
sible toward conciliating the' religious
feeling on the subject; The American
Commissioner Intends to close the bureau
on the Sabbath, and Commissioner Gen
eral Peck will consult with the French
autnor'ities with a view of coming to some
arrangement which will reconcile the sus
ceptibilities of his own .countrymen with
the French expectations and. with the cus
tom here, which makes Sunday a public
holiday. â¢.Â¦ -â¢?.'- *v
A representative of the Associated Press
saw the French exposition authorities In
regard to the question' of closing.. the
American section on the Sabbath and was
told on behalf, of Commissioner General
Peck that the United States would be
quite within itB rights In closing its ex
hibits, but that It would be regarded as a
very unfortunate decision. Sunday, he
was Informed; â¢ was' always the greatest
day of the' week here, and the shutting
of the American buildings would debar
hundreds of thousands from viewing what
would undoubtedly be- one of the. most In
teresting and important exhibits. . â¢
United States Embassador Porter went
through the American section on Thurs
day in order to see for himself the exact
position of affairs, and he afterward ex
preesed himself as extremely satisfied
with the state of progress as compared
with the representations of othercountries.
He found that the only delay now aris
ing Is due to the tardiness of the French
railroad companies in forwarding the ex
hibits. He heard nothing but praise from
Frenchmen regarding the architectural
features of the American buildings.

ANNEXATION
Hatred of the United States
Is Growing on the
Island.
. . ' â Â¦? Â¦ .
Residents Declare They Fared Better
Under Spanish Rule Than
Under That of Uncle
Sam.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MAYAGUEZ, Porto Rico, March 21.â
Bitterness is vague in its expression, but
it exists as a grievance against the great
American nation. Everybody feels that
the island has been made to suffer by its
newly formed connection with the United
States.
I noticed in all towns the Spanish flag
flying. Sometimes there would be one,
sometimes three or four. I asked if the
continuance of the custom had any sig
nificance. Usually the reply was that the
Spaniards were no more hostile to the
Government now over them than are the
Porto Ricans, while they are less open
in making it known.
I shall hesitate to place too much stress
on passing observations regarding this
hostile or anti-American sentiment were
it not confirmed by something besides
passing observations. The undercurrents
are strongly anti-American and political
manifestations are only ripples on the
surface. Said one of the officials whose
duties for a yfear past have kept him in
close touch with thÂ« country people:
"All Americans who are here or come
here are well fed and comfortable. The
vast majority of the Inhabitants of this
Island are neither. They thought wheu
we took Porto Rico that they would be
come . as comfortable as we appear to
them. But they are having a harder time
than they hacl under Spain. Even before
the hurricane came they were worse off
and were beginning to hate us.' The anti-
American feeling is just as strong In the
country as it Is in the town."
Trade is In a bad way, but Felipe Cue
bas believes that after a time American
merchants will find an increasing market
for cotton goods, shoes and provisions and
foodstuffs generally. He said there would
be a chance for California wines to re
place those of Spain. That might compen
sate California for a possible increase in
the cargoes of oranges- that may leave
Mayaguez.
The anti-American feeling, among the
commercial classes is intense. A few con
servative merchants and sugar planters
are trying, to moderate it, in the belief
that Congressional legislation will not be
hostile.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, March 31.â 1n
an interview to-day Governor General
Davis said: Â¦-:*. ... . ;,
"I have not felt it proper for me to dis
cuss Congressional matters, ' filling, as I
do, an executive position, i I have express
ed my views fully, however, on Porto
Rico's needs, and I might say if Congress
should adopt free trade the receipts of the
Custom-houses would naturally cease. Ono
million five hundred thousand dollars has
been collected during the fiscal year and
with free trade this will fall off. What
then will run the island? i
"Although I have received no official
advices regarding an appropriation, I un
derstand through the newspapers, that an
appropriation was decided upon and I in
fer that this appropriation will be spent
on insular government expenses. If free
trade is adopted I cannot see how the
necessary funds for conducting the affairs
of the island are to be raised by myself or
those who succeed me. Two million dol
lars are the present expenses and this
amount will be needed annually. There is
only a small revenue in-coming from
stamps, liquors, tobacco and mercantile
licenses and it is impossible to collect
taxes because of the conditions."

Waldeck - Rousseau's Cun
ning Prevents a Vpte of
Non-Confidence.
Opposition Plans Another Attack
Which May Porce the Retire
ment of the Present
Ministry.
CowTiKbted. jsoo, by the Associated Press.
. PARIS, March 31.â The political inter
est of the week centered around the- de
bate in the Chamber of Deputies on the
interpellation regarding the troubles in
the island of Martinique, In which the
Government, after successfully repelling
last week's assaults, had one of the nar
roweEt escapes in its experience. The
Rightists and many members of the Left
had evidently resolved to unite in a vote
against the Government, which in that
case would have been lost; but M. Wal
deck-Rousseau. the Premier, in a skillful
speech, brought forth a maladroit inter
vention from his adversary, M. Ribot,
who treated the Government as anti
republican because It depended for its
existence on the support of the Socialists.
This changed the question from that of
the responsibilities for the Martinique
troubles to a denunciation of socialism,
and the section of socialists which intend
ed to oppose the Government changed
face and rallied around the Ministry,
which action secured for the Government
a majority of over forty votes.
Ministry in Further Danger.
The character of the debate, however,
had the result of shaking confidence in
the position of the Waldeck-Rousseau
Cabinet and the air since has been full of
rumors of artother determined attack by
the opposition, which, if successful, will
bring M. Sarien into power as Premier of
a moderate radical Ministry.
The speech of M. Millerand, Minister of
Commerce and Industry, at the inaugura
tion of the exposition is looked forward
to with the keenest interest, as the oppo
sition exptcts him to introduce some un
called for *-xiir*Â£sion of socialistic princi
ples which wiil pive them a lever for a
strong effort to overthrow the whole Cabi
net.
An interesting little Franco-American
demonstration took place this week in the
town of Vendomc, which forms a further
indication of the way the wind blows here
in favor of America. Vendome is the home
of th<; Rochambcau family, and a sub
scription was recently raised â to which
Embassador Porter and the members of
the American Embassy were invited to
contribute â for the erection of a monu
ment to the Marquis de Rqchambeau. The
rirst stone was laid early in the- week and
its laying was made the occasion of a
local fete. The stars and stripes were
flown and a message of fraternity was
sf-nt to President McKinley. The commit
tee to-day was delighted to receive a
charming reply, saying the President was
det-plv touched by the sentiments of cor
dial fraternity for the United States
which the committee expressed on the oc
casion of the foundation of a monument
to "one of the most illustrious of those
generous Frenchmen whose names live in
the hearts of all Americans."
Lafayette Monument Dedication.
It is now settled that Archbishop Ire
land will deliver the dedicatory address at
the unveiling of the Lafayette monument
en July 4. The address will be spoken in
French and will be non-religious in char
acter. Embassador Porter will act as
president and the other American Embas
padors in Europe as vice presidents. Com
missioner General Peck will make the ad
drr-sp of presentation to France; Frank
J. Thompson, secretary of the Lafayette
monument committee to the exposition,
will speak on behalf of the school chil
dren, and the monument will be unveiled
by forty-seven American girls, who will
pull tricolored cords.
The French Society of La Sabretacho,
which Is composed mainly of well known
artists and litterateurs, has raised a sub
scription to erect a monument to the
FrÂ«'nch soldiers who fell at Waterloo, to
be placed upon the battlefield. The design
of the monument is very striking. It rep
resents on the summit of a pyramid a gi
gantic eagle at bay, one claw clutching
the staff of a standard to which still ad
here shreds of a flag. The bird, with a
broken wing, stands facing the enemy.
The other claw is raised menacingly and
the beak is ready to strike a dying blow.
The monument Is the work of GÂ«rome.
Embassador Porter denies emphatically
th*Â» report published in America that his
daughter Is engaged to be married to a
French Duke, and adds that she has never
either seen or heard of the gentleman
mentioned.
LONDON PARIS BERLIN
REICHSTAG YET
WRESTLING WITH
THE MEAT BILL
Berlin Government Believes
a Compromise Will Be
Effected.
Lei Heinze Allowed to Die a Natural
Death After Having Caused
Acrimonious Dis
cussion.
Copyright*_ v 1900, by the Associate Press.
BERLIN. March 31.â The various legis
lative bodies here have now adjourned un
til the end of April. From the discussions
before the Reichstag Budget Committee,
it is plain that the Government does not
deem It likely that the special taxes will
cover the expense of the fleet. An in
crease Is necessary.
The Lex Heinze probably will not be
again taken up, but will be allowed to fall
Into oblivion.
Compromise negotiations are constantly
occurring about the meat bill between the
Government and the Agrarians. The Gov
ernment believes the negotiations will end
successfully, the Agrarians dropping their
demands for the exclusion of sausages and
canned goods. The Agrarian Council,
however, has just passed a resolution to
reject such a compromise.
An interpellation, eigned by 130 conserva
tives in the Diet and aimed against Prince
Hohenlohe, is to come up in the Diet after
the Easter holidays. The Government, in
the meanwhile, hopes a compromise will
be effected and that thereby an Interpella
tion will be unnecessary.
A bill has reached the Reichstag against
the spread of epidemics, those mentioned
being the pest, smallpox, cholera, typhU3
and yellow fever.-
Beciprocity With America.
In view of the publication here of several
special dispatches saying Germany has
appointed delegates to a commission,
which President McKinley recommended
to adjust the economic differences be
tween Germany and the United States, In
quiries were made by the correspondent of
the Associated Press. The Foreign Office
officials said they knew nothing about the
appointment of delegates and United
States Embassador White said the same.
The Foreign Office, in addition, pointed
out that In any case the difficulties
against accomplishing the objects men
tioned originated in America and not in
Germany, Germany having, after giving
a satisfactory reply to the United States'
req.upst for the maintenance of the "open
door" policy in China, thus showing her
good will toward the United States, has
several times broached the subject of
America reciprocating by granting similar
concessions in trade with the Philippines.
This matter has been under dlscussioin
though informally, both In Berlin and
Washington.
The American answer has been that
tariff matters are not yet regulated in
the Philippines and must await the proper
time. Besides, the American argument is
that if reciprocity be seriously considered
the.inslgnlncant trade with German Kiao
chau cannot be compared with the enor
mous volume of trade with the Philip
pines, and American would at least ex
pect Germany to throw open not only
Kiaochau but all her colonies to America.
Berlin Social Affairs.
Prince Hohenlohe's elghty-nrÃt birth

About 500 invitations were issued. United

Hon. W. J. Bryan spoke here this after
noon to 3500 people. His speech was main

"As yet there is nothing definitely set

perhaps to some other similar institution,
for the purpose of recuperating, that I
may have my health restored. I am In
a bad physical condition, as I have been
under a severe nervous strain for eighteen
months and my general, health has suf
fered in' consequence. I will remain at
the sanitarium and receive treatment un

the sanitarium she probably would go to
New York to Join her mother and sisters,
where they will reside. She will devote
her time to music.

Winners "Well-Trained.
C. J. D. Goldle, the president of the
light blue boating club, who assisted In
the victories of the last two years, was
forbidden by his doctors to take part in
this year's contest and Mr. Dudley-Ward
succeeded to his office. The three new
men in the boat had gained experience
by taking part in contests at the Henley
regatta and on the whole the Cambridge
crew, coached chiefly by the old blue.
S. D. Muttlebury, was a combination of
well-tried and well-trained oarsmen. On
the othfr hand Oxford had only two other
"blues" â Tompkins and Johhstone â and
had suffered from change and disintegra
tion sufficiently to dishearten the pluck
iest lot of men. â¢-
Cambridge ruled a hot favorite. The
Oxford crew was one of the heaviest on
record, Kittermnster. with his 200 pounds
weight, being the biggest man that ever
took part in the race. Tne Etherington-
Smith rowing for Cambridge is a brother
of the Oxford oarsman of like name. This
Is the first time two brothers have rowed
against each other in this, the greatest
of all European boat races. Lord Grims
ton of the Oxford boat, is a son of the
Earl of Verulam. who took a keen In
terest in the training of the crew, fre
quently following the Oxford boat in the
launch of the coach. Dr. D. H. McLean.
LONDON*. March 71.â The greatest
rowing contest of Europe, that be
tween the Oxford and Cambridge
crews, ended to-day in a most piti
ful procession. The only interest
ing feature was that the record time was
equaled. Even this performance was
minimized by the fact that Cambridge
won on one of the strongest flood tides
that has marked a race day in years and
In perfect weather conditions. The time
rr.q^t- was 18 minutes 47 seconds.
The crowds wer*> in no way diminished
frim th>"> tremendous proportion? of re
cent years, but there was no chance for
enthusiasm. Just a few generous cheers
for Oxford were given as she trailed
alone, at times hidden from the leader
by the twists in the river. It is a long
time Fince the race was bo barren of
features.
If pressed Cambridge probably could
have smashed all records. Oxford is o.ffl
cisilv estimated to have been beaten, by
one minute, but as a matter of fact the
dark blu<r- a had ceased rowing before they
reached the winning post and about a
quarter of a mile separated at the finish
one of thp best from one of the worst
crews that ever appeared in this classic
event. At no time in the race did Oxford
;.prÂ«^ar to make any serious efforts to
catch up with their rivals, who led from
the start. The losers were beaten before
the race began and the hundreds of thou
sands that blackened the banks of the
Thames realized it.
The Race a Procession.
The race was contested over the usual
course from Putney to Mortlake.
The dark blues, as challengers, were the
first to take the water at 1:&) p. m.. arid
were loudly cheered. They were quickly
followed by the favorites, the Cambridge
men whose reception was very enthusi
astic. The tide was Quite strong and con
siderable difficulty was experienced in get
ting the boats into position.
Oxford won the toss and chose the Sur
rey station. Colonel WiUan. who umpired
Tale and Cornell at Henley, acted in the
same capacity for Oxford and Cambridge.

The Type of the Prevailing Grip.
From New Tork Herald.
"Although Grip prevailed In mild form
during: the late autumn months. It has
now taken on an unmistakably virulent
type In the extent and character of Its
new Invasion. During the last fortnight
thousands who have escaped heretofore
have been stricken, and the disease Is
plainly epidemic over a very wide section
of country.
"The type of the disease Is essentially
catarrhal and chiefly manifests Itself in
Inflammatory affections of the membranes
of the nose. throat and upper air passages.
The attack is quite sudden and there is
generally a high temperature, with pain
In the forehead, hacking and Irritative
cough, with general muscular pains and
prostration.
"It Is the attention to little thingsâ the
avoidance of draughts, tho cultivation of
habits of temperance In eating and drink-
ing, the obedience to all hygienic rules â
which can make any one reasonably safe."

by an amendment offered by Allen and
accepted by Foraker that "no public In

The committee had fixed the limit at 10

exception of twoâ the one relating to the
question of citizenship of Porto Ricans
and the other fixing the qualifications of

I.OS AKGELES. March 31.â Judge Allen
has decided the McClelland-Ball case, giv
ing judgment in favor of the defendants,
Captain Ball and wife.
The testimony introduced by the de
fendant showed that Mrs. Ball had not
cheated McClelland out of $13.<YK). as he
claimed, but that when she was divorced
from him the settlement of property in
terests between them had been fair and
just.
At oi.Â» time McClelland was one of the
best horse trainers In the country and
drew a salary of JIO.OUO as manager "of the
Baldwin stables for several seasons.
Lately he has been mentally incompetent
as a result of a sunstroke.
One of the closing scenes of the case
was a bitter denunciation of McClelland
by the lady once his wife but now the wife
of the elderly Adams-street capitalist.
Mrs. Ball has scornfully Jgnored her ex
husband, but while on the witness stand
at the close of the case she lost her com
posure.

threatened my life again and again. He
has threatened the life of my husband."

WAR REVENUE
TAX SOON TO
BE REDUCED
President McKinley Declares
Himself in Favor of
a Decrease.
May Deem It Best, Hoxrever. to De
lay Action Until After This
Year's Presidential
Election.
t
Si>ec!al D(.Â«petch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. WASHINGTON. March 31.
â President McKinley favor? a substantial
reduction in the burdens of taxation im
posed by the war revenue taw; but he has
not ride up bis mind whither or not' it
would be good policy to urge legislation
before the policical campaign this year.
This was the substance of a statement
made by him to-day to Representative
Jefierson Levy of Xew York.
Some time ago Levy introduced in the
House a bill proposing to make a general
reduction in the taxes imposed L>y tho
war revenue bill. He was much pleased
when he learned tnat the question had
been discussed at a Cabinet meeting yes
terday, and he called at the White House
this morning for a talk with the Presi
dent. ;...'-
The President said he was in favor of
a reduction !n war taxes and the only
question in his mind was whether it would
be good policy at the present time. He
was afraid that it might affect the busi
ness interests of the country. If he
thought the busine?* interests of the coun
try would not be disturbed by the recom
mending of a reduction at this time he
would do bo. Otherwise he would wait
until after the election.
Republican leaders in Congress are not
prvpare-d to announce what their policy
will be In dealing with this issue, which
has been go suddenly raised by yester
day's Cabinet meeting, but they will be
forced to deciie upon a definite course in
the rear future.
Representative McClellan of New York.
onn of the Democratic members of the
Ways and Means Committee, set on foot
to-day a movement among the Demo
cratic members of the committee which,
if carried out. will force the Republicans
to either stand against a reduction of
taxation at this time or to follow the
lead of the Democrats In advocating It.
McClellan urged on Representative Rich
ardson of Tennessee, the Democratic
leader In the House, the advisability of
taking up the matter at once in the Com
rniru-e on Ways and M-eans In the House
and makintr the advicacy of a reduction of
taxation Democratic policy. Richardson
thought very favorably of the proposi
tion, and it is probable that a vigorous
fight will be instituted at once.
Neither Chairman Payne nor Repre
sentative Dalzell of the Committee oh
Ways and Means would discuss to-day
the probable course of that committee.

pine leaders, it is said at the War Depart
ment, marks the inauguration of a new
policy In the Philippines. This is the exe
cution of the death sentence by order of
the military officer in command In the
cases of persons, native or others, con
victed and sentenced by military commis
sions organized under the rules of war.
Morales and Gonzalez were convicted by
a military commission of the murder of
Filipinos, and were sentenced to be
hanged near Uayanbanz-, March 30, and
the press dispatches from Manila show
that the sentence was carried into effect.
No official report of the cases has been
received at the War Department and It is
stated that General Otis has acted en
tirely on his own responsibility in the
matter under the authority conferred by
the articles war. There have been sev
eral cases where the death penalty was
imposed by military tribunals, but- up to
the present Instance no case where the
death sentence was carried into effect. All
the previous cases were submit :ed to the
President's official action and In every In
stance the sentence was commuted to
imprisonment for life.
According to the legal officers .in the
War Department, the Insurrection In the
Philippines amounts to a state of war, and
in that view of the case General Otis
acted entirely within his authority in or
dering the execution of the two Filipinos
without special authority from the Presi
dent. It is stated at the department that
General Otis' action is undoubtedly in
tended to suppress brigandage and out
lawry In the Philippine?, but some con
servative officers fear that the summary
action may Jeopardize the safety of
American prisoners now in the hands of
the insurgents.
Secretary Root said to-day that the
Instructions to thtÂ» Philippines Commis
sion will not be made public at present.
as it is desired to keep them open for
changes or additions until the last mo
ment. Consequently the finally written
Instructions to the Commissioners will not
be delivered until the day of their depart
ure from San Francisco for Manila on
April 15. '
President Taft left Washington to-day
for New York. He i? expected to return
here next Tuesday, and -will then proceed
to San Francisco, stopping at Cincinnati

"COMMODORE" WEAVER
HAS COME TO GRIEF
Yacht Norna Held at Auckland as
Hostage for Debts Contracted
by the Adventurer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 31.â The Herald
will to-morrow print a long story describ
ing the adventures of the bogus "Commo
dore" ' Nicholas J. Weaver. For three
years he has been cruising about the
world in the yacht Norna. formerly- of
New York. But at last the Norna is rest
ing at anchor in Auckland harbor, where
she is held as hostage for the return of
various sums borrowed from citizens.
At Auckland Weaver was received with
distinguished consideration and became
the honored guest of a local yacht club.
The Norna was made the flagship of the
squadron. Weaver was lavishly enter
tained, and in return gave a splendid en
tertainment on credit aboard the Norna.
He borrowed money in sums of $l<X>o or
less. Finally, his creditors becoming sus
picious the "Norna was seized for debt.
Th<> "commodore" left Auckland by the
mall steamer for Sydney, where he said
remittances frnm New York were due
him. But according to last accounts these
had not arrived, and the Norna was still
in pawn at Auckland. Weaver will be ar
rested by the police should he return to
New York.

Insane Man Opens the Veins in Sis
Wrists.
STOCKTON. March 31.â Patrick O'Reil
ly, who was taken to the Detention Hos
pital early this morning to be examined
as to his sanity, made a desperate at
tempt at suicide. Breakfast had been
taken in to him and left there, he not car
ing to eat at the time. Half an hour or
fo later one of the keepers vrent to
O'Reilly's room, and there a horrible sight
met his eye. Blood was everywhere.
O'Reilly had broken his coffee cup. and
with the jagged pieces of crockery had
slashed both arms and wrists in a fright
ful manner. The blood was pouring from
several wounds and he was covered with
gore.
Further investigation showed that the
madman had atempted to dash his brains
out against the lower edge of the window
sill, inflicting a deep gash in his scalp.
The man's many wounds, none of which
were dangerous, were sewed up. Â¦ "
It has been learned that O'Reilly once
served a term at the Napa Asylum, and
marks were found upon his wrists indi
cating that this was not his first attempt
at taking his life. The man Is about 50
years of age.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUXDAY, APRLL 1, 1000.
CITIZENS OF
IDAHO BACK UP
STEUNENBERG
Present a Petition Opposing
the Withdrawal of
Troops.
Express Their Approval of tlie Acts
That Have Been Done by the '-.
Governor and State
Officials.
WASHINGTON. March 31.â Governor
Steunenberg of Idaho to-day called at -the
War Department and presented in person
to Secretary Koot the petition to which
he referred while under examination be
fore the House. Committee on Military
Affairs in regard to the retention of the
Federal troops in the disturbed ' mining
districts. The Governor had refused to
produce the petition before the committee
until he had tirst submitted U to Ifie Sec
retary of War,. to whom it was addressed.
Tb'e petition bears about :^v signatures
and recites that all of the Signers me citi
zens of Idaho and oJt the county of' Sho
shor.e and the Coeur d'Aleno mining dis
trict. They petition that the B*cretarJ
of War allow the small force of Federal
troops to remain In tho Quarters provided
for them ami occupied by them- at tho
town of Osborn, Shoshone County, for' as
long- a time as Governor Steunenberg may
think their presence necessary for tho
preservation of peace and order. .
The citizens also express their approval
of all the acts that have been don* lÂ»y thÂ«
Governor and the officials of their state
to preserve peace and order and to bring
criminals to justice.
The petition says that some of the acts
of the State authorities may appear to
people at a distance to bo drastic and se
vere, but the signers, who are familiar
with the conditions which existed for
several years prior to the declaration of
martial law last May, know that drastic
measures were necessary to stop the band
of conspirators; who, shielding themselves
behind the name of the labor organiza
tions, had created a reign of terror and
tyranny seldom equaled in the history of
the community. .. .%
In conclusion the signers beg- to state
that the efforts of the Governor and tho
State officials. &;ssh-,ted by the military au
thorities, have brought peace and good
order to the district and given an impetus
to all business interests and a sense of
safety to all. people, which are highly ap
preciated and for which the signers are
grateful.. ____^'--

WASHINGTON*. March 31.â The House
to-day finished "a hard : week'is work by
passing the Â« fortifications appropriation
â¢Â¦bill: Not v a .single amendment was of
fered and the bill passed as it came from
the committee. It carries JT.OS3,tSS. A
three hours' political debate was precipi
tated by a general political speech made
ty Shattuc of Ohio, many members on
both sides being drawn into it. A rtsolu
ticn was adopted to re-elect the present
board of managers of the National I Sol
ciers Home.:; -..:
When the House to-day proceeded to
the cor.*ideration of the fortifications iap
propriation bill, it was agreed that gen
eral debate on the measure Bbonld not ex
cÂ«<i one and a half hours. Htmenway
of Indiana, in charge of the bill, explained
Its provisions. It carries 17.03.455, or $4.
: 656.450 lets- than the; estimate*.* He said
the reductions had beÂ« r. maae because it
had been -cemonstrat. a that the Govern-:
ment. could manufacture its own guns
cheaper than it. could buy them and the
appropriation would be : sufficient to keep
our gun factories at work t-ipht hours a
day for the ensuir.er : year. The Govern
ment, he' said, manufactured li-inch guns
chtcper by tWjDOQ each than they could be
purchased and lv-:r.ch guns JTSOO cheaper.
Shattuc Scores Tillman.
Shattuc of Ohio, under the latitude al
lowed ia general debate, followed with an
hour's speech on! genera! political topics,
the tariff, expansion and election laws.
Shattuc denounced the inconsistency of
Southern siattsmen in demanding that
the natives of <.Â«ur insular possc^ions be
given all line immunities of Ameirean citi
zenship, whiie they are using all their in
genuity *.o rob the Southern negroes of
the Constitutional rights conferred upon
them. He took as his text an extract
from a recent speech of Senator TiUman
of South Carolina and said:
Tfc'it- distinguished Southern Senator, while

It you maat to learn how the consent -of
xY.f governed iÂ« obtained in a larger field,
ripht here at home, just read the reports of
the contested election cases, which come up
here annually from the Southern States. Why,
Â¦Jr. they vote men down there who have bern
dead fcr five years. They stuS ballot boxes.
They btiJMoze and they adept any measure and

l<C air. Speaker, kaowln* all these facts as I
know them. I do not attach any importance
Â¦whatever to the inconsistent arjruments of
these constitutional expounders, or the "'aym
ratfcy racket" cf the opposition.
The Cost cf Empire.
Richardson, the minority leader, chal
lenged some of tjhattuc's statements rela
tive to the advantage which the latter
claimed accrued to the country- from the
passage of the. Dingley law. Richardson
contrasted the appropriations immediate
ly preceding the Spanish war with those
curing and subsequent to it, contending
that the latter exceeded the former by
$S"0.000,'Â«.Â»0 annually. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦' :. Â¦
. "That sum," said' he, "represents itho
c^st of the empire over the cost of the
republic." Â¦>Â¦â¢ â¢Â¦ '.Â¦ ,-'Â¦
" Does not the pentleman Concede that
much of the expense of the -coming year
out of the insurrection: in the Phil
ipj-ines?" aFke<l Hemenway. >â¢: :
"I do," replied Richardson: "but the in
surrection jbtows out of the empire." :
H*-menwa>' replied- to? Richardson. He
said r.e wa-4 surprised to hear the Demo
cratic leader denouncing excessive ex
!>â¢ nditures. The Democrats had shouted
foi war. he said, -before It was declared;
now they w* re denouncins the expense
th* war entailed. Hemenway challenged
the other side to point out a sinsrleltem
of extmvaeancÂ© in any of the appropria
tion bill*.
In reply to this challenge Fltzr?rald of
Massachusetts and Jett of Illinois cited
the- pr<ir:."tion and immediate retirement
cf high i fflcexs in the army.
Hexnenu ;*.v offered the record of the sol
Â¦":; rs'eo r- -;r*Â»l ih justification. Replying
to Richard- r;'? assertion that the inter
est? of the Â¦-. o'.l-prowers had been -disas
trously affected by the Dingley law Hein
erro-ay sa!<l ;â¢. Â¦ one ever had to explain
why everything went up under the Wilson
law.
William Alder. Smith of Michigan pro
duced figures to show that the price of
6hÂ«ep had doubl' : undÂ«r the Dingley law.
Bell of Colorado declared that the ex
travagance of the present administration
was without parall'! in the history of the
country.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts denounced
the Republican party for not being able
to repress trusts, which, he said, were
enjoying the principal prosperity existing
in the country to-day, and declaring great
dividends on the capital invested.
Ivovrring of kliasacfaosfttsi reverting to
Richardson's statement [concerning the
price of wool. adrr.ittÂ«Â»d that wool had b<^en
higher abroad **irce the passage of the
EMnsley act. But. he said, th^ reason was
manif'w-t to those who undors-tood the
conditions. Betweer. the election in IVÂ»S
and the paesate of the law enormous
quantities of wool had been imported in
antlcipaticr. of a higher tariff. That stock
was now exhaust*^ and the Â¦wtk.l-ktowts
from now on would receive the benefits
of the tariff, which the heavy anticipa
tory importations prevented.
The bill was then passed without
amendment.

Dewey Day.
The local councils of the Young 1 Men's

D. J. Cullen to make arrangements for

population which they supply their purchases through
the year are larger than those of Pacific Coast job
bers. The manufacturers give rebate? in proportion
to the amount of goods ordered, and the rebates add
considerably to the profits of the jobber. By reason
of that advantage and of the low rates they really
receive over most of the region of the Great West,
St. Louis jobbers control the market almost to the
coast itÂ«etf. In round numbers it is 2000 miles from
the Mississippi to the Pacific, and upward of 1700
miles of that is controlled by St. Louis, the freight
rites being such as to virtually shut Pacific Coast job
bers out of competition.
Owing to the possession of water transportation
the rates to the coast itself are in favor of the local
jobbers. Over a ftrip of country about 300 miles
wide they carry on competition with the St. Louis
rr.en and give the retailers and the consumers the
benefit of a competitive market in which to buy. If
the local jobb:r.g trade be destroyed by differential's
in favor of St. Louis, it will not be long before -prices
will be raised inftead .of lowered to Pacific Coast con
sumers, and our people will be wholly dependent upon
Eastern dealers. BS! ' " â¢ : Â¦ '
There :*. moreover, another consideration hardly
if any less important than; that of cheapening prices
to retailers and consumers! and that, is the protection
of the jobbing trade of the coast. It is estimated that
in San Francisco aidr.e theft is $75,000,000 inverted
in the jobbing trade. amount ef capital employs
labor, pays taxes. Improves property and. advances all
the interests ..of the. State. If by railway differentials
in. favor of St. .Louis 'that great industry be rendered
unprofitable, the injury will: be felt not in San. Fran-,
cisco alone, but throughout the cWst.' All the inter
ests of a community are closely interlinked, and the
sacrifice of or.c will affect all ihe others.
The claim =of the. Pacific Coast jobbers is Just, in it
self and. is supported by every consideration of ex
j>edieT:cy. economy and local patriotism. We have a
natural right to have freight rates adjusted to otr ad
vantages as a seaport with water transportation. It
h right that our peo-ple should have the advantage of
competition between a local jobbing trade and that
of the Eart, and. finally, it is right. that an industry
which help? to sustain the general prosperity should
be itself supported by all who share in that prosperity
WHILE it is yet some months before either of
the national nominating conventions- will
meet, the Presidential campaign has vir
tually begun. There are no longer any doubts
as to will be nominated by the two
great parties, nor . as to what will be the
differences between their platforms. It is to
be the; campaign of 1896 over again, with such
changes as the events of the past four years have
brought about. It cannot be a calamity agitation
any more, for this is a year of prosperity, neither can
the free silver craze be made so formidable as it was
in the former contest, but in the main the issues will
be what they were made by the establishment -of
Bryan's leadership in the Democratic party.
That being so, political experts have begun to
figure out the results. In 1896 McKinley had 271
electoral votes, against 176 for Bryan. Some of the
Republican States, however, were carried by very nar
row margins, and conservative calculators do not
claim that the party is sure of carrying them all again.
According to one of these estimates McKinley is sure
of lowa, Maine. Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont,
Illinois, Indiana. Michigan, Ohio, Oregon and Wis
consin.. That will give him 215' votes/ Bryan., it is
conceded., can count upon 142 votes. There remain
00 electoral votes to be fought for, but of these Mc-
Kinley will have tp obtain but nine in order to have
a majority of. the electoral college, and it would seem
to be easy for him to obtain them, particularly as a
State like California is put down in the doubtful
column.
Calculations as to the result of the Congressional
elections are more interesting, as they are not so
much of a foregone conclusion as the Presidential
walkover. Chairman Babcock of 'the Republican
Congressional Committee is reported to have esti
mated that in the next House of Representatives
the Republicans are sure of 150 and the Democrats of
130 seats. That leaves 77 seats to be fought for, and
in a good many of them, if Republicans be not vigi
lant at every point and make strong nominations, the
Democrats will have a fair chance of winning.-
At the present time the Republicans hold the House
by a comparatively small majority. It is clear, there-

his fair young bride the daughter of Mrs.
Chester Averill of Berkshire County. Mas
sachusetts, and niece of the late Justice
Field of Washington. For many years
iliss Averill has made her home in this
city with her aunt. Mrs. William Ash
burner, at 1014 Pine street.
The marriage of the your.g couple is the
culmination of a charming romance. Lieu
tenant Belknap met his bride in this city,
and although the couple had been engaged
for several months no date was set for the
wedding. Then came orders from Wash
ington ord^rins the lieutenant to Join Ad
miral Remey's staff, ordered to Manila,
and the young couple, deciding that sepa
ration would mean unhappiness. the wed
ding day was set. Invitations for the
marriaee went out even before the friends
of the betrothed pair had heard of their
engagement, and yesterday morning there
was a fashionable assemblage at Trinity
to witness the nuptials. The bride was
attended by her sister. Mis 3 Alice Averill,
who came from her home in Massachu
setts to attend the wedding, and Miss
Elinor Davidson. of Berkeley. Six friends
of the groom, all navy men. officiated as
ushers, and Lieutenant Mcale and ' Lie
utenant McLean acted as groomsmen.
The church was filled with a !ar?e num
ber, of army and navy people, prominent
among whom were Admiral Remey and
staff. Admiral Kempff and staff. Captain
Goodrich of the lowa and Captain Strong
of. the Monadr.uck.
No reception followed the ceremony. In
the afternoon Lieutenant Belknap and his
bride sailed on the Hongkong Maru.
STEPHEN M. WHITE
RECEIVES AN OVATION
Ex-Senatcr Stephen M. "WTiite has
corppletely recovered from his late mala
dy. Th&t he has resumed his old time
place in the hearts of his associates ami
adnnirtrs is t\"idenced by the enthusias
tic leception tenderer! him at the recent
annual banquet of the Los Angeles Cham
ber of Commerce. The Los Angeles Her
ald has this to say of the significant
event: . - .
""Where there was so much that was
eventful It is pleasant to note that an in
cident that grew to the dignity of an ova
tion was the arrival of ex-Senator Steph
en M. White. It was well along after
the formalities had progressed.- while
President Nesvmark was making a grace
ful speech, that signals of exuberance
were manifested toward the doors of the
banquet hall. Mr. Newmark had tp stop
and was looking over his spectacles to
ward the entrance to see what wa.s tne
disturbance, when: cries' of "White*
'White,' arose and these soon developed
intp cneers and fchouts of joy. 'Our Steve'
econ shook himself loose frcm the crowd
that surrounded Mm -as he entered the
ball and made his way to a s<?at araMg
the notables at the head of the tables
as ?or.n R5 aU had recognized him' there
was a pandemonium of greeting wh'cn
lasted several minutes. The ex-SU>natcr
was given a seat by the side of Senator
Bard, th*v two shaking hands mos: cor
dially. Senator White, though iookiiK
thir.ncr than of yore, came in with * a
springy step and when he spoke it was
evident that he had- entirely recovered
from his malady, that he was the -ame
old Steve who has been idolized by South
ern Californians since the old days when
he was District Attorney until he reached
the foremost place of all the Pacrir
Coast public men. There was admiratlo: "
and respect intoned in the cheers tb**
were given to him, but there was a*>
more, the heartfelt Joy of a whole peo
ple at his recovery and the sincere friend
ship of all. Democrats and Republicans."
In speaking of Senator White's re
sponse to the toast, the same paper *iys:
"Then came Senator White. It wa* like
the triumphal entry of a returning con
quercr. and so it was. for he had conquer- ,
ed a serious ailment and was hu noblo
self again. Nothing would do the-assem
bly but to hear from him. and TYastmas
ter Franci3 in glowing words of praise
introduced him, and hi 3 trurnret tones
and pulsating periods moved the audience
as if his tones literally vibrated- their
heartstrings. A report of. hi? speech Is
utterly inade<ruate to give an idea of its
moving power, and Its combined grace
and fore-. The cheers and continued ap
plause with- which it -was received will
always remain a vivid memory, as well
as the address, to those vrhi heard both."

THE POSTAL BILL AGAIN.
1 >v ISPATCHES from Washington announce that
) another effort will be made to pass the Loud
*â^ bill restricting the privilege of second class
mail rates to legitimate periodicals. The bill has
been amended in committee, and the features ob
jected to in the House have been eliminated, so that
it is believed a majority can now be counted upon in
its favor.
According to reports thâ¬ bill in its new form is
simplicity itself. It provides that mail matter of the
second class shall embrace all newspapers and. other
periodical publications which are issued at stated in
tervals as often as four times a year, but that the
second class rate shall not be permitted to books or
the reprints of books whether they be issued com
plete or in parts, whether they be sold by subscription
or otherwise, whether they purport to be premiums
or supplements to newspapers or other periodicals;
and that news agents shall not be permitted to return
to news agents or publishers at the poncd rate unsold
periodical publications, but shall pay postage on the
same at the rate of one cent for every four ounces.
Even in its amended form the bll.l will pur a stop
to some of the worst abuses which have grown up
under the present law, and result in a considerable
saving to the Postotnce Department- The economy
is the more necessary because upon it depend several
questions of postal reform and improvement which
have been long desired. As -soon as we are rid of the.
annual deficit Congress give attention to the pro
posals for establishing a one-cent rate for letters, the
circulation of books from public libraries at low
rates, the extension and cheapening of the parcels
post system, and other measures of that kind. For
that reason as well as for the economy itself and the
essential justness of the Loud bill, it is to be hopÂ»?d
that in its amended form it will be enacted at this ses?
sion and the country be rid of what has been for too
long a time a scandal upon our administrative
methods. â¢'
SINCE the crale for making the Nicaragua canal
a fortification instead or a neutral highway for
commerce, the spirit of pseudo patriotism i 3
being appealed to .in behalf of changes in. our- treaty
with Great Britain . respecting warships on the
Great Lakes. The waterway, provided by. the lakes,
whose waters lap the shores of Canada on one side
and those of the United States .on- the other, is the
most, important in theworld-.- It carries the greatest
tonnage by water .to and through the Detroit River
that passes any water front in the world. The treaty
between this country and Great Britain, agreeing to
keep it free of warships, is a standing guarantee of
us neutrality. The lakes cannot be used by either
country. against the other in case of war. The United
States has more to gain by this neutrality than Great
Britain, because we have the large commercial cities
of Duiuth, Marquette. Detroit, Toledo. Geveland
and Buffalo within striking distance from the neutral
ized -writers, with Chicago and Milwaukee, Benton
Harbor and others on the shores of Lake Michigan.
The Canadian cities near the. other shore of those
waters are not important. It is believed that the
movement for changing this wise treaty has two mo
tives. One is the desire of ship-building interests to
take contracts to. build ships for our navy at some of
the lake ports; the other is the idea that we should
have warships in those waters to defend the cities on
our shore line. There may be a third motive in a
desire to remove an objection to fortifying the
Nicaragua canal. As long as the lakes are kept clear
ot warships, under the existing treaty, an object les
son is furnished to which the canal fortifiers can make
no answer.
There is no good argument for changing the treaty.
Only England can ever attack us from the lakes, and
as she can have no navy in those waters, and has
upon their shores no plant to construct one, our com
mercial cities have their best security in existing con
ditions. Of course if we change the treaty, and
thereby introduce a navy upon the lakes, England will
have the same right, and both countries will maintain
a warlike fleet on waters that have been peaceful,
neutral and promotive of prosperity ever since the
war of 1812.
It is a wrong and wasteful policy for both nations,
unbecoming to the civilization which they have in
common, burdensome to their respective taxpayers,
and more likely to provoke war than prevent it.
. The present status of these neutral lakes is a power
ful argument for the neutrality of all international
waterways which serve the great purposes of com
merce. The immense commerce that is done from
Buffalo to Duiuth salutes no war flag, and passes the
guns of no fortress. Its annual value runs into the
hundreds of millions. Its tonnage of iron, copper,
coal, lumber, wheat and corn and manufactured mer
chandise staggers the mind with its immensity. No
war drum announces it. and no sword glints in its
van. No warship frets the waters which float it! The
two great nations which own the shores of its high
way share in the prosperity it brings, and are part
ners in a peaceful victory more impressive than ail
the battles in which men have bled and died, from
Marathon to Modder River. So let it be. Let the
treaty alone.

There is: no law, except the general immigration
regulations, to exemde any of these Japanese. Our
Government does not seem to have been aware of
any danger 01 such an invasion from Japan, and no
safeguard has been put in our treaties with that
country nor in our own statutes. Between us and
the Mikado's empire the door is wide open. In the
population of forty-fire millions I which swarms on
tnose islands, in. an area only equal to that of Cali
fornia, there are enough coolies to wipe out white
labor in California before our public authorities kno'.v
what is the matter. After they are here, their depor
tation becomes a matter of great difficulty. They
come in pursuance of our treaties with Japan. They
can be excluded, not by any local or Congressional
legislation, but only by an agreement made b> treaty
between the two countries. . .
We have to advise that representations be made at
once at Washington, for the purpose of securing ne
gotiations with the Mikado that will give us author
ity to stop this invasion where it is.
Fortunately the ground has been cleared by our
dealing with Chinese exclusion. We began in the be
iief that an ordinance of the San Francisco Super
visors could keep out Chinese. That was properly
set aside by the courts. Then we resorted to an act
of the Legislature, and that went glimmering. Then
we tried it in the new constitution of the State, and
at last discovered that the Cninese were here in pur
suance of the Burlingame treaty, which was the su
preme law of the land, not to be set aside by any local
ordinance, statute or constitution. When our peo
ple remember the long time taken in amending the
Chinese treaty, so that we could secure the present
effective exclusion law, thÂ«y will see the necessity of
immediately beginning the negotiation for an exclu
c on ; treaty w :. h j apan I
We have no doubt that Government will be will
ing to take up the question and to settle it agreeably
to us, and the preliminaries cannot be entered upon
too soon;. : j

We have no law to exclude the Japanese coolie, and
h< has found it out and is piling: on to us by thou
sands. Within the iast fifteen months more than
three thousand of these coolies have landed in this
city. In some parts of the city and State they al
ready outnumber the Chinese. As they drop their
rational dress ar.d wear cur costume they are.r.ctos
easily distinguishable in the throng as the Chinese,
who stubbornly stick to their own garments.
Information from Japan is to the effect that seven
thousand mere have obtained passports to come here,
and the advance guard will begin landing, at the
rate -of from 200 to 300, on each of the steamers
shortly due to arrive. When this horde, already un
der passport, reaches here it will make our Japanese
coo:ie popuiaticn at least 20.000, with the prospect oi
that number being speedily doub'ed. Â¦ Their presence
is exceedingly undesirable. All of the objection;

tea in China, but wh'n visitors come courtesy demand 3 that

thus offered to a visitor the moment he enters a hou?e. . . Â¦
"The family teapot is simply emptied and replenished every

His Excellency Wu TU:g Fang. Minister from China, who
recently made a witty speech at the dinner of the tea experts,
has dictated the following rulesâ the Chinese rul:esâ for brew
ing tea: .;'".-' *â¢>;&< -:.'.-;
"To get down to the basic principles of tea brewing and tea
drinking as practiced in China you must realize that at home
we do not drink tea on stated occasions or only at meals, as
you do here. With us tea Is the national . beverage. I raipht
almost say, speaking to an American, that tea Is the iccwater
of China. Instead of the silver water cooler, which constitutes
an almost invariable ornament of your dining rooms, you will
find everywhere in China the teapot. Whenever we are thirsty
we have recourse to the teapot instead of the cooler.
â¢' "Let us first consider the teapot Itself.. It is invariably of
porcelain nnd varies in style, cost and dimensions in accordance
with the taste, wealth and size of the family possessing it. It
is. as. you say, constantly *in commission.' In the. morning a
sufficient quantity of the dry tea leaves Is placed la it and on
this Is poured hot "water.- Let this infusion stand for a few
minutesâ say four or five â and you have .. what we. I think
rightly, regard as a drink f.t for the gods. > Â¦ 7, â¢>
"It Is always ready. Whenever the pot need 3 replenishing
all we have to do is to. add a little more tea and a little more
water; There Is no. hard and fast rule as to the proportions of
tea and water or as to the character of the tea itself. It 13 all
a matter of Individual taste. We use black or green tea and
have it either weak or strong, just as our tastes direct.
"We never drink it boiling hot, as 1b done in America and
England, but at 1 moderate degree, of warmth. To maintain
this . desirable temperature it is customary., to cover the teapot
with a sort of bag padded with cotton and lined with silk. A
A JAPANESE INVASION.
Q BOUT fifty years ago an American ship, bound
/ \ for this port, picked up in midocean from a
floating raft a company of strange little
brown men, and brought them to San Francisco.
They had been shipwrecked. Their race and na
tionality were not recognized; their language was
unknown; their home port could not, be identified.
They were curies here. Finally it was discovered that
they were Japanese, and they were sent home. That
little company of starved, shivering, shipwrecked
sailors were the first of their race to land on this. Con
tinent. Since then great changes have occurred in
their own country and the world.
The Japanese have become rovers. They lack in
many admirable qualities which the Chinese of the
same classes have. But they are ingenious, persistent,
truculent, and in living can outskimp the Chinese
coolies if they choose. But they are not orderly, nor
sober. They take to the American vices of drunken
ness and gambling with a rest which makes them lor
midable competitors with the thirstiest ot our topers,
and furnishes the Goddess of Chance with eathu
Â« Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ '.. . ." \ Â¦â- -
These Japanese coolies must not be confounded
with the student, merchant and mechanic classes.
Among these are many of admirable skill and excel
lent manners. But there are many reasons why a Chi
r.ese coolie is preferable to a Japanese of the same
fore, that Mr. Babcock's estimates of the coming
elections are the outcome of a sanguine mind.- That
fact is noteworthy because this is a year in which
the one danger which threatens the Republican party
is that of overconfidence. Even if it be beyond a
doubt; that McKinley will be re-elected, the Republi
cans should not. abate one jot of the energy of 1896
in preparing: for this campaign and carrying it to a
conclusion. We ought to have from California a
solidly Republican delegation, and. to that end the
work of party organization should gro briskly for
ward.: The estimates of experts are encouraging, but
we must not trust too much fo them. There were
cast for Bryan in the last election 6.30J.0.25 votes, and
it is going to take work to beat Kirn and his party
even in this year, of prosperity^

THE QUESTION OF DIFFERENTIALS

Chronicle yesterday in an editorial which, after stating
tr.i.: the existing cifierer.tia's in freight rates were
â¢arranged some years s:r.cc at the request ot local

The argument thus presented by the St Louis job
ber; and their friends is deceptive. In the hearings
or. this question before the Interstate Commerce
Commission ". ::s recent session in St. Louis, the
representatives of the jobbers of that city admitted

Under the present rates St. Louis jobbers can and

large advantages to aid them in their efforts to ex

GREAT LAKES NEUTRAL
THE SAX Â¦ FRAXCISCO CALL, SUXD AY, APRIL 1, 1000.
18vice president of the State Spiritualists'
Association, has the following to say on |
the subiect:
"I believe this law interferes with the f
free exercise of the religious views of a j
portion of the community, and that the i
present municipal ordinance is a restric- i
lion of that privilege. I think it if wrong !
in its. application, because no other ex
ponents of a religion are subjected to a
municipal license: therefore, we as a com
mittee shall make every effort to declare
the tax unconstitutional. Judge Daniel J.
Muiphv has been engaged by the Spirit- \
ualist Society to defend them in this test j
case."
Judge Murphy expressed the following i
opinion yesterday: "Nearly twenty years I
ago, when this law went into effect, I was
attorney for the Spiritualist Society In a
similar case and won the suit upon the
grounds that in giving these communica
tions purporting to come from disembod
ied spirits these mediums were simply de
monstrating their philosophy, or religion.
If these mediums, who are working under
a State charter, can show that they are
proving only the continuity of life, which
is the basic principle of their religion,
why. then, I think every court In the land
will declare such license tax unconstitu
tional."
A number of mediums have been Inter
viewed/and all but one stoutly declared.
their determination not to pay the tax.
The exception was Mrs. J. J. Whitney,
who expressed a willingness to- pay the
sum demanded by the municipal authori
ties. Among those who are strongly op
posed to the ordinance are Mrs. Jennie
Robinson. 11. F. Small. Mrs. R. S. Lillie,
Mrs. Sarah Seal and Miss Annie F. Ander
son.
Mrs. Robinson said: "I, of course; as a
representative spiritualist, am opposed to
taxation and think it an imposition; how
ever, I am not willing to make a test
case of It. I don't think it necessary. To
do so would be an acknowledgment of our
weakness. I think it high time to weed
out the charlatans and tricksters, but I
am sure that an intelligent discrimination
should be exercised in the difficult task.
The State organization of spiritualists
should be respected, for they only indorse
genuine mediums."
G. J. Fitzgerald, who has charge of the
outside work in the License Office, is re
sponsible for the present excitement
among the nrediums. In looking over the
books he found that there were only
twenty who were paying the tax. After
consulting with Mr. Scott it was decided
to have notices served upon those whose
advertisements appeared in the papers.
He has given them until to-morrow to pay
the tax, and those who fail to do so will,
he says, be prosecuted.

CHARLES H. STANYAN, A CANDIDATE FOR GRAND MARSHAL
CHARLES H. STANTAN", a member of Stanford Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West, and one of the most popular business men of this
city, is a candidate for the grand marshalship of the big celebration
which is to be held in this city on September 9 next. On the 23d
of this month the Grand Parlor of the organization will convene at Oroville
and it will tht-.n be decided on whom the honor to lead the magnificent
pageant shall fall.
Mr. Stanyan is a member of Stanford Parlor, which is one of the fore
most branches of the splendid organization, and he will go to Oroville as
a member of its delegation. He will go there championed by his parlor and
his numerous friends who are working hard to secure, for him the office
which he seeks. His friends, and they are legion, feel that no one more
worthy could be chosen for. the position of grand marshal.
One of the strongest claims to be advanced by the Stanford Parlor dele
gation Is that a member from their parlor should be appointed to the office
because other parlors having candidates in the field are represented on
other committees. or have been honored h'-retofore. Special attention is called
to the Pacific Parlor, which is advocating Steve Costello for grand marshal.
James D. Phelan, who is a member of that parlor, has been chosen chair
man of the celebration and it is. claimed it would be showing too much
partiality if the grand marshal was chosen from the same ranks. Major
Charles Boxton is also a candidate for the office and National Parlor, of
which he !.-Â» a member, is advocating his selection. It is remarked that' Na
tional Parlor has been honored in the past and that it should step aside and
allow another parlor to be represented in the celebration. A member of
Stanford Parlor stated that National Parlor was presented with the grand
marshalship in ISiW and that its members ought to feel satisfied to see an
other parlor given the plum.
The struggle for the coveted honor will be a warm one, judging by the
interest taken in <he fight at this early day. It is thought that Mr. Stan
van's chances of securing the appointment are excellent. His great popu
larity and high standing In the organization will materially aid him, and
added to this his parlor is backing him to a man.
Mr. Stanyan is a son of Charles H. Stanyan, the man after whom
Stanyan street takes its name. The candidate's father was one of those
chosen to lay out beautiful Golden Gate Park and his work in behalf of the
people' 3 playground will never be forgotten. The son is no.w 33 years of age
and is a member of the firm of Culm & Stanyan. representatives of large
Eastern manufacturers. He has been a member of the Native Sons of the
Golden West for over ten years and Is past president of Stanford Parlor.
He has been identified with the work of the organization during that period
and has been one of the hardest workers in the fraternal cause.

The case was called in Judge Fritz's

MRS. J. J. WHITNEY.
*=p = 3HE' fiftv-sccond- anniversary cele
fh bration of modern spiritualism has
j^, been ushered in like- a tempest in
Â¦ a teapot. The spiritualists of this
city are rife with indignation because on
this anniversary of their religion a mu
nicipal tax has been imposed upon the me
diums, whom they claim are demonstra
tors of their occult phenomena.
In lÂ£SO an ordinance was passed requir
ing mediums, clairvoyants and others to
pay a quarterly license of $10. The ordi
nance was inoperative and the matter was
allowed to drop. La3t week, however, no
tices were again served upon the various
mediums to pay the sum, and a meeting
of the Mediums' Protective Union was
called to discuss the effect and injustice
of the tax. The union appealed to the
State Spiritualists' Association for as
sistance, and they in turn will rely upon
the National Spiritualists, with headquar
ters at Washington, D. C, for aid.
Measures have been taken to make a
test case of the mediums' tax, and a com*
mittee was appointed to carry the project
Into effect. This committee is composed
of Mrs. Jennie Robinson. William M. Ri

"It is a mighty engine of war. There
is no ship In the world, except one sim
ilarly equipped, that can withstand the
Impact of those four projectiles simul
taneously fired by one of the superim
posed turrets of the Kearsarge."
These words of commendation of super
imposed turrets were spoken this after
noon by Rear Admiral Sampson. He went
to Hampton Roads especially to witness
the trial of the turrets and stopped In
Washington to-day long enough to speak
to officials of the manifest advantages of
this type of turret and the advisability
of adopting it for future construction.
The double turret was thoroughly tested
and is an assured success, both from
military and structural standpoints. There
are no interference between the plans of
guns or inconvenience from blast or
smoke. The structure, tested with sim
ultaneous discharges of three guns, is
amply strong to withhold the united
shock of the four guns of either turret.
The absence of a suitable electric device
for simultaneous discharge of all the guns
prevented this final test. Both pairs of
fc-inch guns were tested in simultaneous
firing. : "
"There is no other arrangement of guns
on warships in the world that can strike
within the limited area which can be
struck by projectiles from the Kear
sarge's battery. The effect on an enemy's
ship would be crushing."

ANOTHER FIRE
IN THE HEART
OF KESWICK
Smoking Ruins Where a
Dozen Buildings Once
Stood.
Loss Falls Heavily on the Owners,
as Insurance Companies Do
Not Care to Place Risks
in the City.
?
REDDING, March 3tâ Within one hour
to-day a portion of the business section
of Keswick was laid low by fire, entailing
a loss of about $13,000, with $3500 insurance.
The space occupied yesterday morning; by
twelve business houses and dwellings Is
now a black waste. This is the third flre.
all great ones for a town of that size, that
has visited Keswlck.
Owing to the lack of water for flre fight
ing in the smelter city the insurance com
panies have gradually withdrawn from
there until insurance from flre is nearly
impossible to obtain. The origin of to
day s conflagration is unknown. It start
ed in the rear end of a saloon and lodging
house owned by George Bassett. A woman
was barely rescued from the burning
structure with her life. Nothing of the
contents was saved. Bassett's loss Is
$5000, with $2000 insurance. The flames
leaped across the street and swept out a
saloon ajid a rooming house, both owned
by George Graig, loss $2000, no insurance;
a bathing establishment and three dwell
ings owned by Mrs. Millie Sample, loss
$3000, insurance $600; a building occupied
by an Italian restaurant, loss $1000, insur
ance $450, and a dwelling owned by
Charles Crook of Redding, loss $300. no In
surance. Before the block was consumed
the flames made their way across an alley
and destroyed the Justice's Court build
ing and the South Park Hotel. The con
tents of the last two buildings were saved.
Luckily the last two were separated
from the main business section by a
couple of vacant lots. By heroic work on
the part of the poorly equipped flre fight
ers the flames were prevented from going
farther and destroying the whole town.

brought by P. Stolberg and L. Maurer
against the Mountain Copper Company.
Plaintiffs are owners of land upon which,
is growing 2500 almond and 300 assorted
fruit trees. They claim the trees are ren
dered non-productive and are dying from
the effect of poisonous fumes from the
roisters of the defendant corporation's
smelting plant at Keswlck, three miles
from Sha-sta. They represent that they
have been damaged In the gum of $15,000

also as=k for an injunction perpetually re
straining the copper company from op
erating its roasters and furnaces without
the use of appliances to condense the
fumes.
ALLEGATIONS OF
ROBERT LODGE DENIED
Answer Filed to His Suit in Which
He Claimed to Be the Heir of
J. D. Lodge.
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. March 31.â The eagerly
awaited answer to the petition of Edwin
Reynolds for letters of administration on
the estate of J. D. Lodge, the well-known
capitalist, was filed in the Superior Court
this afternoon by John P. Overton, the
administrator, through his attorneys, Tom
Geary. A. B. Ware and D. R, Gale. It
will be remembered that Mr. Reynolds
represents In his petition Robert D. Lodge
of England, who claims to be the son and
only legitimate heir of the dead capitalist.
The answer denies in detail the sensa
tional and startling allegations made by
Mr. Reynolds as the mouthpiece for the
heir from England.
Administrator Overton first denies that
Mr. Lodge died possessed of property
valued at the figures stated by Mr. Rey
nolds. The allegation that Mr. Lodge
when he left his English home almost
half a century before his death leaving
a wife and son and daughter behind is
given an emphatic denial. It is denied
that Robert D. Lodge is the next of kin
of the deceased or a son at all. This
statement is backed up by the averment
that Mrs. Harris, Mrs. Prince and David
Lodge are the only legitimate children
and heirs of the deceased. The marriage
of J. D. Lodge and Mary Ann Redman in
1546 in Wakefield is denied.
It Is stated in the ajiswer however,
that J. D. Dodge and Martha Lodge (nee
Noble) were married at Pottsville, in the
State of Pennsylvania, on June 11, 1852,
and that from that time until death did
them part they lived together as husband
and wife. A denial is made of all the
other allegations and Judgment of the
court is asked denying the petition of Ed
win Reynolds, and that the same be dis
missed, and that Mr. Overton's letters of
administration be not revoked and that he
recover his costs.
A demurrer to the petition and motion,
to strike out were also filed this after
noon. The demurrer is made on the
grounds of the uncertainty of the peti
tion and that there are no facts set forth
to justify revocation of Mr. Overton's let
ter of administration. The administrator
has also filed a notice that on April 6, in
the ortlce of Notary Public J. T. Camp
bell, in Santa Rosa. Mr. Reynolds and
Robert D. Lodge will be required to ap
pear and have their depositions taken,
and have with them on that occasion cer
tain documents they claim to have In
their possession.

EXPLANATION DEMANDED
OF REV. DR. TENNEY
San Jose Teachers Incensed Over
Statements Credited to Him in
a Newspaper.
Special Dlspetch to The CalL
SAN JOSE, March 31.â Tho city cam
paign has already gone a few degrees
above the normal temperature, and this
is all because of a misunderstanding be
tween the schoolteachers of this city
and the Rev. H, Melville Tenney. The
trouble arose over the meeting of the
Pastors' Union held Monday morning,
which had been called for the purpose of
discussing city politics. The preachers
at that time expressed themselves unan
imously in favor of the citizens' nom
inees, who are headed by Harry J. Ed
wards for Mayor. Dr. Tenney of the
Congregational church and liev. Mr.
Maciaren of the Second Presbyterian
church were the principal speakers. The
former declared that politics dominated
the schools, and that teachers were
obliged to have the indorsement of one
of the political bosses before they could
secure a position, and that many of them
felt keenly this humiliation.
One of the local papers misquoted Mr.
Tenney, so the minister declares, and
caused him to say that "the schools of
the city are a disgrace to a civilized com
munity." This caused the pretty school
ma'ams to rise in wrath and say all kind
of things about the pastor. The faculty
of the Horace Mann School requested
that a meeting of the Teachers' Mutual
Aid Association be called and an expla
nation be demanded of Mr. Tenney. Tho
executive committee of the association
held a meeting last evening to discuss the
matter. A letter was read from Mr. Ten
ney in which he said that some of the
statements attributed to him by a local,
paper had been garbled and twisted. He
stated he was a true friend of the schools
and teachers and wanted a hearing."
This allayed the wrath of the school
ma'ams gome. A committee, consisting of
Superintendent Russell, Louis Bruch and
Miss Enna M. Ringo, was appointed to
look into the matter and find out Just
what was said at the meeting.
This committee will visit the Pastors'
Union meeting next Monday morning and
pet an expression from its members as to
tho speech on that occasion uttered and
the sentiment indorsed by them. They
will also interview others that were pres
ent.
A meeting of the executive committee
will be held Thursday evening to hear the
report of the. investigating committee.
The teachers object to being dragged in
to politics and are not anxious to get any
notoriety during the coming campaign.
DEPOSITORS DECIDE
TO PRESS THEIR SUITS
No Further Hope of a Compromise
With Stockholders of the De
funct Union Bank.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. March 31.â There remains
but little chance of a compromise between
the stockholders and depositors of the de
funct Union Savings Bank, and the court
litigation that has been stopped by a sort
of armistice for a couple of weeks will
again proceed with unusual vigor.
The depositors had agreed to accept
$300,000 cash and the bank's assets in lieu
of all claims agalnÂ«t the stockholders, and
the stockholders seemed willing for
awhile, but a change has come about.
This would give depositors about 90 cents
on the dollar. The depositors recently
obtained Judgments against the stock
holders, aggregating $28 60 per share. At
torneys Laib and Tompkins, representing
the stockholders, have notified their
clients that the stay of execution expires
April 8, and it they want to appeal they
must at once prepare to give bonds. In
this notice the attorneys admit all efforts
to compromise have failed.
The depositors have attachments on the
property of all the stockholders and de
clare they have the upper hand in the
fight. So far 15 per cent dividends on de
posits have been paid. They will now
press the Judgments on suits against the
stockholders for their pro rata liability.
OIL MAGNATE TRAVELS
WITH SMALLPOX VICTIM
Porter on the Private Car of Richard
.C. Kerens Found to Have the
Dread Disease.
ST. LOUIS, March 31.â Thomas L. (Gen
try, a negro porter on the private car of
Richard C. Kerens, which was used' by
H. Clay Pierte, the oil magnate, and
party on a trip to Texas, was sent to

With Pierce on the Texas trip were his
son and John D. Johnson, the attorney.
They reached St. Louis last night, and
until to-day were unaware that for sev
eral days they had been on the same car
with an Incipient case of smallpox.
Strike Ended.
SPOKANE, March 31.â A special to the
Chronicle says the strike in the mines of
the Nelson district, British Columbia, has
ended. The mines in the Nelson and
Ymir districts will pay uniform wages of
$3 25 a day. It is distinctly a concession
on the part of the mine managers. The
strike started ten months ago, and has
caused great loss in the British Colum
bia mining districts.

PANAMA CANAL
Commodore Germinet Says
One More Effort Will
Complete It.
Panama Company Owns All thB Ma

Baise Half the Fluids Required
to Finish the Work.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN DIEGO. March 31.â 1n an interview
with Commodore Germinet of the French
cruiser Protet. the Union in the morning
will quote him in regard to the success of
the Pan-American Canal Company as say-
Ing that there remains but one more effort
on tho part of the company to accomplish
this "greatest victory of man over the
forces of nature."
The Protet spent a month at Panama
recently, and as a French otticer the com
modore was careful to note the progress
of events there. In part of the interview
he is quoted as saying: "The most favor
able project will cust 512,000 francs and
can be carried to completion iir eight
years. This project, however, necessitates
the use of three locks. The canal, how
ever, can be built on a levelâ that Is,
without the use of locks at a cost approx
imately of six hundred million francs and
requiring a much longer time.
"If account is taken of the enormous
difficulties that are necessarily met with
in Â¦tartlns works of this character in a
new country, it is safe to estimate that
two-lift hs ol" the entire work has been
accomplished.
"The Panama Company owns at Colon
and at Pu.na.ina all the plant necessary to
be turned over to the new company that
will undertake to finish the work. The
plant consists of dredgers, steam shovels,
locomotives, flatcars, N rails, barges, tow
boat, tools and machinery of all kinds, all
of which is estimated to be worth 150.0U0,-
GuO francs.
"By reason of an agreement between
the general manager of the new company
and the receiver of the old company the
new company lincis Itself in a most aflt
tering condition. It will be in a position
to dispose of first. 3<J.<>"o,ooo francs of its

BRAIN FOOD
Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is Di-
gested.
Nearly every one will admit that as a
nation -we eat too much meat and too lit-
tle of vegetables and grains.
For business men, office men and clerks,
and In fact every one engaged In seden-
tary or Indoor occupations, grains, milk
and vegetables are much more healthful.
Only men engaged in severe outdoor
manual labor can: live on a heavy meat
diet and continue in health.
As a general rule, meat once a day is
sufficient for all classes of men, women
and children, and grains, fruit and vege-
tables should constitute the bulk of food
eaten.
But many of the most nutritious foods
are difficult cf digestion and it Is of no
use to advise brain workers to eat largely
of grains and vegetables where the diges-
tion is too weak to assimilate them prop-
erly. \ ' : . Â¦'.' '
It Is always best to get the best results
from our food that some simple and
harmless digestive should be taken after
meais to assist the. relaxed digestive or-
gans, and several years' experience have
proven Stuart's Dyspepsia. Tablets to
be a very safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive and a remedy which may. t>e taken
tiaily with the best results. .-
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. can hardly
be called a patent medicine, as they do
not act on the bowels nor any particular
organ, but only on the food eaten. They
supply what weak stomachs lack, pepsin
diastase, and by stimulating the gastric
glands Increase the natural secretion of
hydrochloris acidi . .
People who make a dally practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after each meal are sure to have
1 perfect digestion, which means perfect
health. .'. :; - Â¦' '. :-"-Â¦-'â¢
There is no danger of forming an in-
jurious habit as the tablets contain ab-
solutely nothing but natural digestives;
cocaine, morphine and similar drugs have
ri'T place Ini the stomach medicine, and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are certainly
tlie best known Mid most popular of all
tt'irnach rernf^lle?.
.Ask your druggist for a fifty-cent pack-
BtÂ« of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet?, and
efter a week's use note the improvement
in health, appetite and nervous energy.

Twenty-Eight Independent Foresters
Visit the Grand Padisha to
Receive Oriental DegTee.
At the close of the last held meeting of
Court Yerba Buena of the Independent
Order of Foresters the senior woodward
announced that the team from Court Seal
Rock which had tx?en invited to confer
the Oriental degree on a number of can
didates was In waiting. The teamâcom
posed of S. Phipps. grand padlsha; G.
Pitney, grand vizier; F. Everett, grand
pasha; A. E. Graupner, grand prophet,
and E. N. Cameron, grand herald â upon
invitation took possession of the court
room and, with the assistance of a num
ber of Nubian slaves, in a short time con
verted it into an Oriental palace the
magnificence of which has never before
been excelled In the conferring of this
very ancient and sublime degree, by
which the candidates are transformed
into Princes of the Orient. The robes
worn by the officers named, imported
from the Far East, are very costly and
gems of Oriental art. It is said that they
were used by ancient Arabs in the confer
ring of the mystic rites of this degree,
and the crown worn by the grand padi
sha is said tp have at one time been the
property of AHiletes, who reigned in Egypt
SO B. C. The swords and arms worn by
the members of the team have each a
history, that during the ceremony is ex
plained to the candidates for princely
honors, and then and at no other time
axe the princes permitted to feel the
weight of these implements of war of the
ancients In the palm-decorated rooms,
in which burned soft lights in golden
cen?ers which emitted delicious aromatic
odors from special herbs, were Introduced
twenty-eight strangers who were anxious
to cross the narrow and sandy path that
leads to the locale of the grand padi
sha. for "the path is boset with great
perils and many hardships have to be
overcome before any one can be brought
into the august, presence of the dispenser
of princely commissions." which on that
occasion were on "special sale" on ac
count of the great nunmber applying for
them. The candidates passed tnrough the
ordeal all right and received all the se
crets of the degree, which they were all
bound by an ironclad oath not to make
known to any one who Is not a Prince of
the Orient, under severe penalties. After
each new Prince had received his com
mission with the seal impressiblv afflxed
he was taken to an adjoining hall and
there kept until the last commission had
been given out; then all were made guests
at an ordinary every nlgM collation, at
which there was not the slightest sign of
Oriental luxury. The Princes all looked
in vain for the grand padisha and his
retinue. These had been transformed into
ordinary mortals. There was. In addition
to the collation and clears, a fhort pro
gramme of songs, music and literary ef
forts.
ANOTHER TRIUMPH.
Holbrook Blinn of San Francisco
Achieves Success on the I/on
don Stage.
Mr. Holbrook Blinn of San Francisco
has pained new laurels on the London
stage. His third and greatest success
was recently achieved at the Prince of
"Wales Theater, in ''Don Juan's Last
Wager." a romantic play in four acts
from the fcianish. The critic of the Sun
day Special in an extended .review of the
play comments In this fashion:
"Mr. HHnn makes forward strides In ev
ery part he undertakes, and if he was'un.
forgettable in 'The Cat and the Cherub,'
impressible in "The Only Way,' he has to
my knowledge never done so well as in
the part "of the commander. Hey! how
breezy and Impetuous he Â¦was when he
rounded on Don Juan, the finest sword of
Seville: how his. words savored of the
grandezza of old Spain, when he dealt
with the reprobate, and then again bow
firmly as a rock he stood for many mm.
utes an image of stone on a pedestal â he
even succeeded In avoiding ridicule when
in his marble clothing he entered the sup
per room and bade Don Juan follow. It
was all so fine and so vigorous that I am
not at ail sure that Mr. Blinn is not the
man to play Don Juan; at any rate he has
advanced his reputation, and his col
league. Herbert Sleath. in particular, can
study from him the difference between
acting In sixteenth century _ plays and
modern melodramatic style."
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN OF
STATE OF CALIFORNIA
The Board of Survey Still Examin
ing State Property â Division En
campment in August.
Matters in the line, of the National
Guard have been very quiet during the
past week. The board of survey of the
Second Brigade has been at work Inspect
ing thÂ© property of the State in charge of
the several organizations located in thla
city, and in a few weeks will submit its
report.
It is probable that the division encamp
ment that is to be held on the State
grounds near Santa Cruz will not bÂ© held
until August, as it appears that the men
belonging to the several organizations
outside of San Francisco will not be able
to leave their employment for a week
without great Inconvenience until after
the end of July. In the meantime the
camp site will be put in condition for the
three brigades that are to assemble there.
A portion of the blouses delivered by
Mandel, Pursch & Co. have be*>n distrib
uted, but the others, which. It is said,
are not quite up to the standard, have not
been accepted.
Corporal Z. M. Harris has been appoint
ed sergeant, vice King, in Company H of
the Fifth Infantry. Corporal E. H. Hort
men and Corporal G. I. Wildberg. of the
same company, have been promoted ser
geants, vice Bales and Roberts.
The Marion is at Mare Island, where
she is being cleared of the barnacles and
sea weed which accumulated during the
two years she was at anchor in this bay.
The next meeting of the officers of the
First Infantry will be held next Thursday
night, but it is doubtful if any business
will be transacted, as those who were re
cently elected have not yet received their
commissions.*
Captain Goodell of Company C, First
Infantry, who has been ill for some time,
is convalescent.
May Be Major General.
There is still some talk that it is the
intention of Governor Gage to remove
Major General John H. Dickinson from
the position of division commander of thfÂ»
National Guard, and it is now asserted
that when that event takes place Briga
dier-General "Warfield, commanding the
Second Brigade, will be appointed major
general.

LABOR UNION
BATTLES WITH
LABOR UNION
Bricklayers' Fight Is Begin
ning to Assume Large
Proportions.
International . Organization Accuses
Civil Service Commissioner P. H.
McCarthy of Trickery to Aid
His Political Interests.
A battle is now on in earnest between
the local Bricklayers' Union of San Fran
cisco and the Bricklayers' and Masons'
International Union. At present the local
organization has, the upper hand in the
controversy and the international men are
locked out. The strike against the local
union ordered by the international is be
ginning to make itself felt, however, and
before many weeks pass it is safe to as
sume that hundreds of international men
will have arrived in this city prepared to
battle with the local men for precedence.
Civil Service Commissioner P. H. Mc-
Carthy, who is president of the Building
Trades Council, is blamed for the present
state of affairs by the international men,
and they say that he is dovetailing his
interests In the council with those in poli
tics â is playing both ends against the mid
dle. Nicholas Dugan. who represents the
international organization in this city,
thus expressed himself regarding Mr. Mc-
Carthy, but he says the end is not yet.
Circulars issued by the International
Union from its headquarters at Cohoea,
N. V., on March 20, declaring a strike on
the locaJ union are beginning to arrive in
packages; and the influence they will wleid
will soon be determined. The circular
reads:
The executive board has been obliged to order
a strike against the local Bricklayers' Union
of San Francisco, Cal.. and the Building Trades
Council of that city. This local union, backed
up by the liullding Trades Council, has been
endeavoring to exterminate our union, and like
wise the B. and 41. I. U. Jron the State.
Acting upon the action of the last convention
the executive board decided to send President
Klein to that city to effect If possible a settle
ment of the differences there existing, riving
him full power to act for the best Interests of
the International Union. He has done every
thing compatible with honor and would easily
have succeeded were It not for the action of
the Building Trades Council. They have struck
against our men and caused them to lose their
employment. This Building Trade* Council is
controlled chiefly by one man and has been
used as a political machine to advance the In
terests politically of some of its active spirits.
It has made its boast that it will drive the In
ternational Union out of the State, and we are
going to slve thorn a chance to do it.
We will assist our brothers of No. 1 of Cali
fornia with moral, physical and financial aid.
And we invite all members of the International
Union now traveling on the Pacific slope or the
Northwest Territory to so to that city and as
sist our brothers. There is excellent Induce
ments, as work is and will be very plenty. The
hours of work are eight hours per day and the
pay is ii per day. or Â£2'j cents per hour. There
Is more brickwork to be done there than can
be handled by the combined forces of our union
and the local. The city is to expend some $25.
000.000 in public improvements alone, notably a
new brick sewer system, and' the general
amount of brickwork in commercial building is
unusually large. Here is a splendid opportunity
for bricklayers who are competent to carry on
work by contract or overseelne, for they can
get all the work they want or they can make
their own terms.
All we ask or desire of them in return Is that
they will stand by our union. No. 1. in all mat
ters, for this is to be a fight to a finish between
the International Union amt the local union and
Its backers, thfe Building Trades Council. The
abuse and contumely they have ca-?t on the In
ternational Unicn is something awful. They
have given President Klein their ultimatum
that all International Union men muÂ«t pay a
special initiation lee of $100 to be allowed to
Join their union, and then they will see. after
getting their money, that they will not Bet any
work.
Brothers, this Is an awful rtate of affairs.
We want you to resent It. "We want you to
stand up and defend your rights and your or
ganization and teach these people a lesson they
will not soon forKet.
A number of the carpenter contractors are
with us In this fight. They want us to furnish
them with competent bricklayers or contract
ors, and they will give them the brickwork, for
they do not want to give the game to the local
boss bricklayers. Therefore don't miss this op
portunity. Fill that city with bricklayers. We
have opened a headquarters there at 117 Turk
street, and all International Union bricklayers
arriving in the city will please call there and
register, and they will be provided for.
There is. and will be, plenty of work.
The statement in the circular, "this
Building Trades Council is controlled
chiefly by one man," Mr. Dugan says, re
fers to Civil Service Commissioner Mc-
Carthy.
"Mr. McCarthy has so influenced the va
rious local unions." said Mr. Dugan last
evening, "that all, with the exception of
the stonecutters, plasterers and one or
two small organizations, obey his sugges
tions, and on an international man finding
a position on a job all other workmen,
with the exception of those named, imme
diately pack their tools and 'walk out.' In
every city in the Union international men
may deposit their cards and go to work
on them without further ceremony, but
here an initiation fee of $100 is demanded
by the local order. It is unjust and un
reasonable, and although this fight among
tho labor unions may at this time be
looked upon with pleasure by the employ
ers of labor in anticipation that wage
scales will be lowered, such will not be
the case.
Â¦ "International men will now hurry here
by the hundreds, and when contractors
are apprised that sufficient are here to
guarantee that jobs given into their hands
will be finished, the tight will be over and
the local union will yield."

ASSAULTED HIS
LANDLADY AND
HER DAUGHTERS
Blake Franklin, a Young
Man, Savagely Attacks
Three Women.
Â«
Miss Parmentier, One of His Victims,
Unconscious for Over Two
Hours â Their Assailant
Arrested.
Because they refused to allow him to
gel away with a latchkey to their house
Blake Franklin, a well-drc-ssed young
man who was formerly employed a3 a
stenographer at Mare Island, last evening
brutally assaulted Mrs. Parmentier of 3W
Jones street and her two daushters. One
of the girls was so badly Injured that she
was unconscious for over two hours.
Franklin has been rooming with the
Farmentiers for about a month. Recently
he secured a position on a transport that
leaves here to-morrow and so notified
Mrs. Parmentier. Last evening he went
to the house and after packing his gtip
started to leave. Mrs. Parmentier, notic
ing that he had taken the latchkey, asked
him for it. For a reply Franklin struck
her in the face, knocking her down. Her
daughter, Louisa, appeared on the scene
at this Juncture and seeing her mother
lying prostrate on the floor demanded an
explanation of Franklin.
With an oath the furious young man
smote her on the jaw. knocking her out.
As she fell helpless to the floor he re
peatedly kicked her about the neck and
body. The unfortunate woman's sister
rushed to her rescue and was herself
severely beaten by Franklin.
The screams of Mrs. Parmentier at
tracted the attention at Policeman George
Brown, and rushing into the house he
placed Franklin under arrest. At the
City Prison he was charged with an as
sault to do great bodily harm.
As soon as Franklin was taken away
Mrs. Parmentier became alarmed over the
condition of her daughter Louisa and siie
sent for Dr. Coleman. He worked over
the girl for two hours before he suc
ceeded in restoring her to consciousness.
Her body was a mass ot bruises, the re
sult of the beating she received.
Franklin , did not deny that he struck
the three women. "The key belonged to
me." he said, ''and I did not propose that
they should have it. As I started to leave
the house Mrs. Parmentier grabbed me
and demanded that I should give up the
key. She finally became so demonstrative
that I handed her one just for fun. Her
daughters then attacked me and I was
forced to put it all over them. I sup
pose they will keep me in prison for sev
eral days at least, which will prevent me
from going with the transport."
The police intend to place two additional
charges of battery against the prisoner
to-day.

THEY WERE COMMISSIONED
PRINCES OF THE ORIENT
SAN DIEGO, March 31.â The people of
San Diego to-night tendered to the
officers of the French cruiser Protet
and of the United States training
ship Adams, now in the harbor, a
bounteous banquet at the Brewster Hotel,
which was quite international in its char
acter. The French cruiser, which has
been here for a week, has become- quite
Important for the time in the social life
of the city. She has received visitors each
afternoon of the week and hundreds have
taken advantage of . the opportunity of
examining one of the most modern of the
fhips of France. She is a beautiful ves
sel, built on line 3 of naval architecture
which are somtwhat different from those
of the United States and which do not im
press one at first sight. She is not tur
reted and carries her heaviest guns at
the side, amidships, the gun deck being
contracted fore and aft. so that the big
guns can be fired straight ahead or
straight astern.
The cruiser is of the second class, was
built at Bordeaux in I S SS and equipped
at Rochefort In IS9?. She is 331 feet long
carries thirty quick-fire guns, two tor
pedo tubes, four searchlights, two triple
expansion vertical engines, sixteen boilers
and has a speed of 20V& knots.
She Jame here from the south, having
been last at Santa Rosalia, the port on
the gulf fide of the peninsula, from which
the product of the big copper mines owned
by the Rothschild family is shipped. Her
officers are: Captain de Valnean Germl
net, commandant (commodore) of the
naval division of the Eastern Pacific; M.
Miron de TEspinay, captain of the frigate
and second officer; M. Colliard. lieutenant
and adjutant of the division: MM. Hue,
Escudler, Thelot, Labarre and Dove. lieu
tenants cf the vessel; M. Calmet. chief
engineer and engineer of the division; M.
Charet, commissary officer of the vessel
and of the division; M. Gauran, physician
of the vessel and of tho division; MM.
Martin, Guenet and Gerant, assistant en
gineers; MM. Aubon. Bouchard, Mon
guilot, de Monts de Savasse. Pascal.
De Peytes de Montcabrier and Bourgeois,
cadets of the first class.
It was not the original purpose of Cap
tain Germinet to call at this port, but he
heard that the plague had reached San
Francisco and came here to find out. Now
that he is here he proposes to remain as
long as his orders will permit.
Since coming here the French-speaking
people of the city have been planning for
the banquet of this evening to be ten
dered to the officers of the cruiser, and
when on Wednesday the training ship
Adams of the T'nlted States navy dropped
anchor In the harbor and fired a salute to
the commodore on board the French
cruiser it was determined to have the offi
cers of the Adams up to the banquet and
make it a sort of international affair.
The officers of the Adams are: Com
mander, W. Goodwin; lieutenant com
mander, W. F. Halsey; junior lieutenant.
S. V. Graham; navigator lieutenant, J. H.
Hetherir.g-ton; ensigns, !>. M. Overstreet,
T. A. Kearney. O. J. Murfin and D. A_
Mahoney; paymaster, J. C. Sullivan: chap
lain, J. B. Frazier, and surgeon, R. T.
Orvis. All of these officers, as well as
all of the officers of the cruiser, save
those who were on duty at the time and
could not get away, were on shore this
evening. They were met at the Santa Fe
wharf with carriages and were driven to
the hotel, where upward of a hundred of
the officials and citizens of San Diego had
gathered to greet them and participate
with them in the best banquet that the
proprietor of the hotel could set forth.
The banquet hall was decorated with
the red, white and blue of the two na
tions, and their flags were entwined at
either end of the banquet board. The
toasts were national only, nothing local,
as it was feared that something might
creep in which would prove of no Interest
to the guests of the evening. The Presi
dents of the two republics, France and
the United States, were toasted: also the
navies and armies of each, as well as the
officers of both. the visiting vessels, and
"the red. white and blue colors of both
nations, whose friendship should remain
as fervent forever as It Is to-day."
Those addresses which were made In
French were interpreted into English and
vice versa, by Eugene Daney and E. Ber
nard. They were all filled with praise
for the two countries and congratulations
at being able to be present at this even
ing's function. The last toast was not
finished until some time after midnight.

the office of Irving M. Scott. The out
come was the adoption of a resolution to
withdraw the request sent to the Cali
fornia Congressional delegation to secure
an appropriation of $50,000 for the Pacific
museum. This was brought about by the
statements of the Philadelphia museum's
representatives that pressing for an ap
propriation for San Francisco would de
stroy the chance that Philadelphia has
for an appropriation. Director Wilson
said that the Philadelphia museum is in
a position to readily duplicate a very
large part of its exhibits, and he pro
posed a system of co-operation, whereby
the Pacific museum would receive all the
information and dunlicate exhibits ob
tained by the Philadelphia museum in re
turn for information and duplicate sam
ples to bP collected hero. A meeting will be
held in the Chamber of Commerce rooms

PLACER MINING ON A
BIG SCALE IN ALASKA
Company Operating on I^atuya Bay
Will "Wash Out One Thousand
Tons of Sand a Day.
Benard Stahl of New York, who Is now
at the Palace, has come West to superin
tend the outfitting: of the annual expedi
tion of the Latuya Bay Gold Placer Min
ing Company, in which he is a very heavy
stockholder. The company owns claims
on Latuya Bay, Alaska, that cover twelve
square miles of the beach. The sand runs
only about $1 50 to the ton, but the oper
ations of the company are on such a large
scale that the profits are enormous. Three
years ago operations were commenced on
an extensive scale. Last year a steam
scoop-shovel, with all the latest improved
placer mining machinery, wan taken up,
and during the past winter has been put
in place. Mr. Stahl went up with the par
ty last year, the company having char
tered a steamer. He says that it will be.
possible to handle 1030 tons of sand a day
with their present plant at a comparative
ly small expense.
The Latuya Bay Company is a close cor
poration, and nearly all the stockholders
reside here. Mr. Stahl. who Is a big cigar
manufacturer, was formerly president of
the company. He 6ays that Just prior to
the outbreak of the Boer war an English
syndicate had inspected the Alaska prop
erty and were about to purchase it for
several million dollars, but when the war
broke out the deal was indefinitely post
poned. '

The latter asked the men if they would
go to work, and receiving an answer in
the negative he ordered them all dis

death and sickness on board, the circum

According to the report of Captain
Freile, a Chinese died under suppicious
circumstances a few days before the ves
sel reached this port. Another Mongolian
was taken sick shortly afterward. The

had not yet been determined and that It Is

Tha missionary 'barkentinÂ© Morning Star
has changed hands once again. Had the
old state of affairs continued she would
now be fitting out for another cruise in
the Southern Seas with missionaries and
literature tending to spread the gospel of
Christ. Inetead ehe 1b being got ready to
carry gold hunters to Nome, and In the
future will take her place among the mer
chantmen of the Pacific Coast.
The Morning Star has run for many
years between the Islands of the south as
the harbinger of peace. Missionaries
have come and gone on her and on many
an Island her coming has been the occa
sion of the year. She always brought the
latest news from the outside world and
also luxuries that the natives were not
accustomed to. As a general rule the ves
sel would appear on the horizon with all
sail set. The cloud of Bmoke coming from
the hollow mainmast would show that the
auxiliary screw was adding to her speed,
and when the natives saw this all hands
would gather on the beach and a right
royal welcome would be given the gospel
ship.
>.ow, however, she is bound on a dif
ferent mission. The missionaries require
a larger vessel, and In consecruence the
Morning Star was put up for sale. Tho
highest bidder was Captain Sherman of
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company. Ha
lias a number of cl.iims located at Nome,
and wanting a vessel to carry himself and
partners to tho frozen north he pur
chased the Morning Star. The vessel was
already fixed up as a passenger carrier,
so it did not take long to get her ready
for the Nome trade.
In the meantime the Liebcses were look
ing for a vessel to carry the overflow ap
plicants from the Zealandia to Nome.
They made an offer to Captain Sherman
and yesterday he accepted it. The bark
entine has in consequence again changed
hands, but the gold fields will still be her
destination.
Captain Shay takes command of the
Eteamer Orizaba, and the Coos Bay will be
laid up for repairs. During the last trip
of the Coos Bay the deckhands quit the
ship at Santa Cruz and the officers had to
unload and load the ship. The trouble was
over the washing of the decks. The men
were called out at 6:30 a. m. by the mate

RAILROAD FILLING
IN MISSION BAY
Southern Pacific Is Adding Many
Miles of Track to Its Switch
ing Facilities.
Mission Bay will soon be wiped off the
map of San Francisco. For some time
the bay waa used by the city scavengers
as a dumping: place for garbage, and
later the land created by this nlllnsr in
process was leased by the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company to a lumber com
pany.
Huntlngton, however, has now decided
to use a portion of the fllled-ln flat to ex
tend the switching facilities of the rail
road, which has outgrown the accommo
dations on the north side of Mission Chan
nel.
The Southern Pacific Company la filling
in the flat with the object or 'adding eight
miles of e-wltchlnes to its already exten
sive facilities In the section about Fourth
Btreet. A few years ago there- were but
two switch tracks on the east side of
Kentucky street, whereas at present the
whole section Is covered by rails, and yet
tho facilities are Insufficient to accommo
date the lncreasod traffic.

SECRETARIES WILL
ORGANIZE SHORTLY
An Association of Coast Commercial
"Workers Fostered oy the State
TJniv^rs'-tv.
Within the next week or so an organiza
tion will be formed of all the secretaries
of commercial and industrial bodies of
the Pacific Coast. The movement was
started by H. P. Woods, secretary of the
San Diego Chamber of Commerce, who
in letters to his brother secretaries stated
that an association should be formed so
as to draw them Jn closer touch with each
other. Also for the holding of annual
meetings at which notes could be com
pared and representatives of different
bodies get acquainted.
Mr. Woods suggested that as the Uni
versity of California had interested itself
In the Pacific commercial museum the
management of the State institution
would foster a secretaries' association.
The project has made a successful
start, for favorable replies have been re
ceived from the' secretaries of the Cham
bers of Commerce of San Francisco, Sac
ramento, Santa Barbara, Spokane, Salem,
Portland, Humboldt, Tacoma, San Jose,
Oakland. Riverside and other places.
The university also haa taken up the
matter and Professor C. Plehn has re
quested the following gentlemen to take
charge of the organizing of the associa
tion: E. Scott, San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce; J. K. Freud, Merchants'
Association; E. Goodwin, Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association: G. A. Dennl
son. State Hoard of Trade, and H. L.
Smith of the City Board of Trade.
jority of the lodges to invest the entire in
come in such stock. The Judge in his de
cision-reviewed the nature and character
of the trust and of the original decree de
fining the trust, and decided that the trust
was for the use and benefit of the order
in this city; that the order, as the bene
ficiary, was a unit, or one society, and as
such was the equitable owner in its col
lective capacity, and that a lodge has not
a right to any aliquot part or any separate
and distinct part of the income. The ma
jority of the lodges were entitled, the
court said, by directing the trustees in the
manner prescribed in the original decree,
to alter from time to time the disposition
of the income and to devote thÂ© same to
any purpose of the order they saw fit.
This decision upholds the right of a ma
jority of the lodges to control the manage
ment and execution of the trust and the
Income of the trust property. The Judge
remarked in his opinion that the order
was not organized for profit, but for senti
ment and fraternity, and he did not con
sider that it was for the court to say that
it was not for the interest of the order
that the Income be Invested In the hall
association stock.

BY MAJORITY
Judge Seawell Decides the
Sam Brannan Trust
Clause Case.
Holds That the Order May Use the
Income From Mission-Street
Property to Pay Off
a Mortgage.
Judge Seawell has handed down an opin
ion in the case of David Hunter and oth
ers against Philo White et al.. In which
he practically decides that the income
from the property deeded the Odd Fel
lows of San Francisco by Sam Brannan
In 1552 may be used In such manner as the
majority of the lodges of the order In this
city may direct. The action decided yes
terday was brought to determine whether
or not the decree of the old Nineteenth
District Court, adjudging that the income
from the property in question shall be
equally divided among the various lodges,
is final, and whether the action in which
it is sought to turn the* income toward the
payment of the mortgage on the property
of the Odd Fellows' Hall Association can
be maintained. A demurrer to the Hunter
petition was overruled by Judge Seawell
yesterday, and the respondents were given
ten days to answer.
There has been quite a heated contro
versy among the Odd Fellows of this city
relative to the investment of the income
of the Mission street lot in the stock of
the Odd Fellows 1 Hall Association. The
lot. with Its improvements, Is estimated
to be worth $100,000. A convention of dele
gates from the different lodKes has been
held, and it was voted to direct the trus
tees to invest the income of the lot In the
stock of the Odd Fellows' Hall Associa
tion, and twenty of the lodges approved
its action. Ten lodges refused to approve
this action, however, claiming that each
lodpe has a distinct and separate right to
a share of the income, that It should re
ceive its share annually and that the In
come could not be diverted to any other
use or purpose. This matter. In order to
determine the rights of the order and of
the lodges, was taken Into court, and
Judge Seawell yesterday overruled the de
murrer to the petition of the twenty
lodges and sustained the right of a ma-

It is a case of /ight nowâ "tight to the
death for the boy," as Mrs. Fennell has
it. That the wedding bells will not ring
oyt does not seem to 'trouble- Theo Jr.'s
mother. There was never much love
mixed up in the mother's version of the
reunion.
It was always the childâ "the child
brought us together." Mareeau has no
longer any place in the heart of the
woman who is the mother of his child;
and slie calmly states that she can't love
a man "who has only a fringe of hair and
wears a wig." Till pushed to the wall
Mareeau protested his love for Mrs. Fen
nel and his desire to call her again wife.
This the' mother believed until her. at
tention was drawn to a want advertise
ment in the Herald calling for a hand
some young woman to take charge of a
five-year-old boy and to travel with him
abroad. In the face of such evidence Mrs.
Fennell is forced to believe the bewigged
colonel fair and false, 'and places no lur
ther faiih In all hi* protestations.
Mrs. .Fenneil is at the Van Nuys, and
with her is her son, Allen Fiske. the maid,
Martha Frenzel; and her baby, Theodore
Jr. Mrs. Fennell's boy was returned to
her yesterday morning after breakfast by
the maid from the Hollenbt-ck. where he
had been with Colonel Mareeau in room
134. When the maid met Mrs. Mareeau
at the depot she was not accompanied by
the child. She. asked Mrs. Mareeau to go
to the hotel, informing her mistress that
the colonel was in bed at the Hollenbeek
and expected her to come there and greet
him and the boy.
"Yon may Bay to the colonel that if he
wishes to greet me as his wife 1 am regis
tered at the Van Nuys." Mrs. Mant-au
said to her maid; "and that I expect my
b.oy to come to me as soon as possible
after breakfast."
Mrs. Mareeau has had three Interviews
with the colonel, the last extending from
8 until midnight last night, but never did
he broach tho subject of a reconciliation.
Mrs. Fennell is not ca^t down now that
she knows Colonel Marceau will never
again call her wife. She had looked fa
vorably upon a reunion on account of the
child, but now she proposes to take legal
steps to gain full possession of her boy.
'It I want to remarry," she ssid, "I
don't need to wait for Colonel Mareeau.
There are two men anxiously waiting for
me to make them happy, but I rim not
thinking of marriage now. To lose Colo
nel Mareeau will not break my heart. He
is illiterate, never went to school but a
year and h half ar.d is made out of dark
blue mud."
While Mrs. Fennell is taking the pre
liminary steps to battle for the possession
of her child she is managing to enjoy
herself, and has renewed many old ac
quaintances made in formf-r years. Her
boy la ever by her side and she does not
propose to let him out of her sight.

The sloop Emma takes her place. The
flagship May has been taken of! the ways,
and the sloop Aeolus is now on.
Commodore W. N. McCarthy of the San
Francisco Yacht Club intends to cruise to
Santa Catalina this season and has made
many changes in the trim of his schooner
Ramona. lie has shortened her bowsprit
three feet and has brought the second jib
in six feet. This will make her less likely
to i>ay off in a squall and will make her
more easy to handle. The sloop Twilight,
Â¦which was chartered a season or two ago
by Arthur Naylor of the San Francisco
Yacht Club, has been chartered for this
season to two young men and will sail
under San F"ranclsco colors. "Ex-Vice

residence in Saueallto to-day for the sum
mer. He is accompanied by Harold Bur

sloop Cyjrnus. which has been moored
during the winter at Escalle, came out of
the Corte Madera Creek last Sunday and
is at her Sausalito moorings. Harry Dot
and George Kollansbee have chartered C.
Chltter.den's yawl Phyllis.
The members of California Yacht Club
are actively engaged in putting their craft
in order for the coming season. The boat
house and its neighborhood presented a
busy scene last Sunday, ex-Commodore A.
M. Clay, R. L. Eame?, J. Laughland and
several other owners putting a day's work
upon their boats. The sloops Pactolus,
Royal and Secret will all have new suits
of pails from the East. The Royal is be
ing lengthened; the sloop Embla is having
a eTeat deal of Interior Â¦work done, and
the yawl Gypsy will receive a new center
board.

Turner -of Henicla. sailed on Wednesday
for Unalaska, whence she will proceed to
Cape Nome. Her passengers are four
young mfti, of whom George Genereaux is
managing ownor and navigator. He is a
mate and Gregory M. Goodale, another of
the four, has passed the examination for

A Married Woman's Residence.
The Supreme Court has rendered a de
cision which will certainly be of Interest
to every married woman in the State, ard
especially those who on account of fam^J*
troubles are living apart from their baa

tutes a married woman's residence" It

on the ground that the wom.nn was not
a resident of Alameda Count?. The Su

Riflemen on the Ranges.
There will be largo quantities of pow
der consumed on the several rifle ranges
to-day. The majority of the marksmen
will be at Schuetzen Park, where the
California Schuetzen Verein, Vereln Eln
tracht and other organizations will hold
their regular contests for class medala.
At Shell Mound the Deutsche Krieger
Vereln. Independent Rifles and the Oak
land militia will shoot. The Columbia
Pistol and Rifle. Club meets .to-day at

On next Sunday the Red Men's Schuet
zen Company will hold its annual eagle

Ehooting contest prizes will be given to
the marksman bringing down the several
parts of the wooden bird placed on the
top of a tall pole. The rifleman striking
the heart will be Shooting King: for the
year.
The range committee of the National
Schuetzenbund, which is to hold the big
rifle tournament here next year, has
failed to make a selection of a range.
Captain L. Siebe of Shell Mound and
Captain F. Schneman of Schuetzen Park
have made liberal offers and promised to
put the ranges in order for the big event.
In either place many alterations will
have to be made in order to accommo
date the riflemen and spectators.
The Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club
has joined the Bund. F. E. Mason and
D. W. McLaughlln are the delegates. The
Ban Jose Rifle Club has also made appli
cation for membership.

Â»th inst., in which the crack shots of the
Oakland and San Francisco Police De
partments and the Berkeley University
team will compete for a trophy. Each
team is to consist of ten' men, who will
shoot the firearms with which they are
provided, the policemen with repeating
magazine rifles and the university boys
with Cadet Springfield muskets. Each
marksman is to j=hoot ten shots at 200
yards on the Blunt military target. The
members of each team have been ac
tively practicing for the contest for sev

"STRAW BOND" KELLY
DENIED A NEW TRIAL
On Motion of the Defendant Sentence
Is Inferred. â Augustus Jacobs
Goes to San Quentin.
Final judgment of the Supreme Court is
all that stands between Thomas A. Kelly,
ex-clerk of Police Court 4 and a term In
the State Prison. Kelly, who was recent
ly convicted of knowingly and unlawfully
accepting a "straw bond" for the release
of one Wilson, a colored petty larcer.y
thief, appeared before Judge Lawlor yes
terday for sentence. Judge Lawlor first
denied the defendant's motion for a new
trial. Although, the court said, some In
competent testimony might have crept
into the record, he was satisfied that such
testimony was not prejudicial to the in
terests of the defendant. Kelly, he said.
glalnly violated the law by accepting the
ond in question on the sidewalk, even it
he believed the same to be good; but as
the whole transaction was so corrupt
there were, no extenuating circumstances
"By the passing of sentence on this de^
fendant," said Judge Lawlor, "the 'straw
bond' Incident in wnlch this defendant was
a party will not be considered closed by the
court,, as there are others involved in the
crime whose guilt I hope will be exposed.
The proper authorities are now investi
gating- the matter, and doubtless they will
take steps to punish the offenders.
Kelly was ordered to stand up to receive
his sentence, but Judge Dibble asked for
a continuance until Tuesday, that he
might call witnesses to prove the- defend
ant's previous good character. The mo
tion was granted and Kelly was returned
to Jail.
Augustus Jacobs, a soldier, recently con
victed of grand larceny, was sent to San
Quentin for five years.
Modern Trojans Dance.
Last Friday night the members of Hec
tor Lodge of the Modern Trojans gave an
at home In Friendship Hall of the Odd
Fellows' building to their friends. The
hall was too small to hold all who accepted
the invitation to be present. There was
an entertaining programme of music,
songs and dances, and then a fish poud.
Painted His Bloodhound.
Captain F. Slevert, 42 Clarendon place,
owns a valuable Siberian bloodhound. Fri
day some one painted the dog In brown
and jrreen colors. The captain and his
wife spent several hours trying to wash
off the paint, with small success and
later the captain brought the dog to War
rant Clerk Peery and wanted a warrant
for the arrest of the painter on the charge
of cruelty to animals, but as he had no
idea as to the identity of the miscreant
the warrant was not issued.

UNIVERSITY OARSMEN
TRAINING FOR A RACE
Have Arranged a Match "With, a Crew
Representing Columbia Rowing
Club of Oakland.
The most interesting prospective event
among the oarsmen is tho approaching
race bet^^en the University of California
barge crew and a four of the Columbia
Rowing Club. The Berkeley men have
unfortunately been prevented from prac
ticing together for some time owing to
the fact that their barge has been under
going repairs at Rogers' shop. Rogers has
been slow in finishing the work on the
boat,. hence the university crew is handi
capped by lack of practice. The Columbia
men, however, kindly offered their boat to
the university on Sunday last. The Co
lumblas have an old college oarsman and
an experienced stroke in Harry Haight.
Charles Goodwin at No. 3 is also an ex
perienced oarsman and a painstaking
coach. J. H. Dieckmann at bow is strong
and willing, and is taking advantage of
the good coaching the crew is getting.
The fact that the university crew, while
its barge is being repaired, has no other
racing barge to row in shows how difficult
It would be in the present state of things
to send a crew to the Eastern States that
would do itself any credit. If this is true
of a four-oared barge crew, it is easy to
see that the difficulty amounts to impossi
bility when it comes to an eight-oared
crew. There are not eight men in the uni
versity who could sit a racing eight-oar,
and if there -were, there is not an eight
oar on the coast. Dr. Benjamin Ide
Wheeler was, therefore, getting on a little
too fast when he promised his friends at
Cornell that be would send a crew thither
from California in l'.*)l. The ma-gniflceiit
air of California must have inflated his
ideas a little, and the Easterners who
heard his enthusiastic talk must have
smiled. The regrettable thing Is that the
failure to appreciate the difficulties of
preparing a crew to row in a racing eight
tends to throw doubt on Dr. Wheeler's
knowledge of rowing matters.
The four of the University of California
are: M. E. Scott, bow ; J. \V. Barnes, No.
2: D. Goodale, No. 3; T. V. Kington,
stroke, and Percy Pembroke, coxswain.
The representatives of the Columbia
Rowing Club are: J. H. Dieckmann, bow;
Charles Bates, No. 2; Charles Goodwin,
No. 3; H. H. Haight, stroke, and Karl
Beatty, coxswain.
A committee of the Triton Boating Club
waited recently upon the Street Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors to ask
permission to move their boathouse from
its present location to the foot of Larkin
street. The matter was referred to the
City and County Attorney, who â¢will de
cide whether the Supervisors have power
to grant the application of the Tritons
or not.
George Blum and J. Helldron, the latter
of whom has recently returned from Ma
nila, have taken vigorously to gig rowing.
The Dolphins and Tritons recently paid a
visit to the life-saving station at the Pre-
Eldio. John Peat and his wife, who also
handles the oars well, make trips there
frequently. John Peat was one of the
early members of the Neptune Rowing
Club, which occupied a boathouse on
North Beach, but is no longer In exist
ence. Tom Keenan of the Dolphins in
tends to enter the outrigged skiff race in
the next regatta, and George Baker is
keeping In practice with the sculls.

Troops at Presidio Turn Out for In
spectionâBattery O Goes to
Angel Island.
The troops stationed at the Presidio
were yesterday reviewed by Post Com
mandant Colonel Richard I. Eskrldge,
Twenty-third Infantry, and staff. "Two
troops of the Sixth Cavalry, Light Battery
C, Third Artillery, and the two companies
of convalescents at the post turned out on
the parade ground north of the general
hospital, near the beach. The review was
interesting and was watched by a. large
number of army ladles.
Battery O commanded by Captain C. A.
Bennett and Lieutenant 11. C. Evans, has
been ordered to Angel Island to-morrow
for temporary duty. The battery will
take up its station at the detention camp,
and on the arrival of the transport Sher
idan will act as a guard of the prisoners
who have been sent from Manila.
Sergeant James C. Robertson, Troop B,
Fourth Cavalry: Sergeant Benjamin Craig,
Troop I, Fourth Cavalry, and Private
Patrick Branigan, Troop C. Fourth Cav

About thirty riflemen have Joined the
new club, which will hold its first shoot
to-day on the Schuetzen Park rantje.
The range committee of the National
Schuetzenbund has modified the rules
regulating the bullseye contests for memÂ»
bers. Heretofore no re-entry was per
mitted, but at the big rifle tournament
next year the rifleman who fails to se
cure a bullseye on his first ticket will be
permitted to secure tickets until he
brings up the flag. On re-entry tickets
but one bullseye is permitted, and the re
maining chances. If there be any. lapse.
This custom prevails at tae rifle tourÂ»

THE SAN ERANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 1, 1900.
COURSING WAS
OF THE CLOSE
ORDER AT UNION
The Short Ends Won Often
Enough to Make Bet
ting Interesting.
â¢
Contestants In To-Day's Finals Axe
So Evenly Matched That the
Winners Will Be Hard
to Pick.
The programme offered In thÂ« run down
of the open stake at Union Coursing Pa.rk
yesterday wua a very even affair and the
courses In consequence wert> Rood tests
of the running Ã¼blllty of the doga. Of the
forty-eight couraes eleven were captured
by the Bhort enders, sumo at good odds
and all of them of tha legitimate order,
not one course being won on v fluke.
[ Curtis & Bon's Narcissus* allowed up In
great form and was heavily played
against Athena, the Aeneld Kennels' en
try as a 6 to 1 favorite. These odds were
reduced somewhat after an undecided, but
Narcissus took the second cuurse in easy
style, unslghtlng Athena. A strong play
has been made in the long odds book on
Narcissus as the probable winner of the
stake in to-day's tinal.
The even . card for to-day makes It a
hard guess to pick the flag getters.
Bona Fide showed plenty of speed yea
terday and looks a winner against Teddy
Hale. Greenhall should win from Silver
Lyon. St. Anthony against Wonder,
Thornhlll and Reannex will no doubt
furnish close and even coursing. Craw
ford Lad and Palo Alto are expected to
make an -interesting run with chances
slightly In favor of Geary's youngster.
Shadow was at false odds against Shoot
over and won out on the short end 1 to 4,
and is looked upon as a coming dog. Nar
cissus looks an easy winner against Be
nicia Boy and Curtis' Cash and McKinley
stand a good show in their -first courses,
though against Gallant and Honor Bright
it will be no walkover for either of them.
Three Cheers on the short end beat out
Rona, and against Royal Anne to-day will
have a hard race.

THE battle In San Francisco between
the jobbers and manufacturers of
the Pacific Coast and the jobbers of
the Middle West, particularly St..
Louis, for the trade territory of the Pa
ciric Coast, will open in the United States
courtroom in the Appraisers' building, at
11 o'clock to-morrow morning. It will be
a notable struggle and one in which the
entire Pacific Coast Is vitally interested.
'Ine Interstate Commerce Commissioners
who will be present are: Martin A. Knapp
of New York, chairman of the commis
sion; Judson C Clements of Georgia.
James D. Yeomans of lowa and Joseph
V.*. Fifer of Illinois. This is the first meet
ing of the Commissioners in this city.
Some testimony concerning the matter at
issue has teen taken in Los Angeles dur
ing the past week, but the main struggle
will take place here.
Attorney E. S. Pillsbury will represent
the Pacific Coast Jobbers and Manufac
turers and may be assisted by \V. F. Her
rin. There being two ways to get freight
to the coastâ by rail and by waterâ the
transcontinental railroads are parties ir.
interest. They wish to have the freights
brought by rail and not by sea. Conse
quently, they are interested in having the
differentials that favor the Pacitic Coast
Jobbers and Manufacturers maintained.
That Ifi the explanation of the probable
appearance of Mr. Herrin.
'Ihe Middle West jobbers will be repre
sented by H. L. Christie, attorney for
the St. Louis Business Men's League:
Cnarles A. Parker, chairman of the St.
Louis Traffic Bureau; J. M. Allen,
traffic manager of the Meyer Brothers'
Drug Company, and Frank N. Johnson,
r- presenting the Simmons Hardware Com
pany, the Business Men's League and the
Commercial Exchange of St. Louis. G. W.
Sterry will appear for the Santa Fe road.
The Pacitic Coast Jobbers and Manufac
turers" Association, in addition to its at
torney, v.-ill have as representatives before
the commission President Wakeiield
Baker, Traffic Manager H. D. Loveland.
A. C. Rulofson. W. R. Wheeler and other
members of the executive committee.
The contentions of the Middle West job
bers, who brought the suit, have been
often told.* Wakefieid Baker said yester
day that the issue is whether the business
of the coast shall be done by the people
who have invested th^lr money here or
by the outsiders, who have no investment
oh the coast. A. C. Rulofson says the Cal
ifornia producer 'Is as much interested as
the jobber. If rates were placed upon tho
m!lÂ«?agÂ» basis the producer will have to
pay The highest price of any one on the
cuntinent to get his products to the mar
ket. Traffic Manager Loveland <Â»aid that
not only was what Mr. Rulofson had said
strictly" true, but it was also a fact that
San Francisco would, on the mileage
basis, necessarily have the highest rates
In both directions of any place upon the
continent.
The hearing may last a fortnight, but
will probably close sooner. Much time
will bÂ«* given to the discussion of differen
tials.
Frank N. Johnson of the Simmons Hard
war*? Company of St. Louis, who is lead
ing the St. Louis Jobbers in their fight be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commission,
arrived last night from Lcs Angoles and Is

holders and burroughs placed the three

gards electoral qualifications. Every man

lodger qualification if the qualification be

FUTILE CONSPIRACY OF
BRAZILIAN MONARCHISTS
Plot Comes to Naught but Punish
ment for the Revolutionary
Leaders.
"WASHINGTON. March 31.â An official
of the State Department Just returned
from Brazil has furnished some interest
ing details in regard to the recent at
tempt of a clique of Brazilian army offi
cers to Incite a revolution and establish
a monarchial government there. The
plan of action, the official says, was to
create a military riot In front of the
President's palace, during which Campos
Balles was to be assassinated, an officer
of the revolutionary band declared ruler
and Brazil proclaimed a monarchy. It
seems, however, that owing to Informa
tion furnished by an army officer fully
cognizant of the brewing conspiracy, the
President was at ail times aware of the
plans and progress of the revolutionists.
Two prominent generals In the Brazilian
army were involved in the plot,. but. ex
cept for their small following, the army
stood firm for the President, and the
project came to naught but punishment
for the offenders.
CHIEF JOSEPH'S APPEAL.
Nez Perces Sachem Wants to Remove
His Tribe to Oregon.
WASHINGTON. March 31.â Chief Joseph
of the Nez Perces Indians, located on the
Colville reservation, Washington, has filed
with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs a
petition to remove his band to Oregon.
Chief Joseph says that he desires to be
located in the Waliowa Valley, at the con
fluence of the Grand Ronde and Snake
rivers, near Seven Devils Mountains. He
says that he had talked with the people
of "that region, who think it might be pos
sible to have his tribe settle there. The
Commissioner of Indian Affairs to-day
said that if the Waliowa district was not
too thickly settled it might be practicable
to grant Chief Joseph's request, but he
feared that conditions would not permit
this action. â¢

CHICAGO UNIVERSITY
FIVE MILLIONS RICHER
John D. Rockefeller Duplicates I*arge
Contributions Obtained by Its
Officials.
CHICAGO. March 31.â The University of
Chicago is richer to-night by nearly
$5,000,000 than it has ever been before.
John D. Rockefeller has confirmed his gift
of $2,000,000 to the university and President
Harper, Secretary Goodspeed and the
trustees supplemented it with the an
nouncement of gifts in cash and lands re
ceived aggregating in value more than
$2,000,000.
It was a condition of Rockefeller's giftâ
the latest of a series aggregating more
than $7,ooo.oooâ that before the university
received the same It duplicate the amount
with gifts secured through the efforts of
its officers and friends.
This duplication (equivalent to securing
for the university at least four millions)
was to have been completed by January 1,
1000: but at that time the university, on
its own behalf, was far short of the $2,000.
000. Rockefeller extended the time for
raising the needed sum three months, or
to April 1.
More than J2.P00.000 in good land, cash
and secured pledges was in the possession
of President Harper and the university
officers to-day, and the exact character of
the prize was wired to Rockefeller. He
instantly replied that his gift of $2,000,000
was now assured. Regarding his plans,
Dr. Harper said:
"Now we will build â build many new
structures Just as soon as work can start.
Every pledge we have received is good,
and our valuations on these pledges and
gifts have been low. Land we have ac
cepted only at its actual oash value."
Talking of some of the contributors to
the $2,000,000 fund. Dr. Goodspeed of the
university said:
"We have been careful not to mention
names because of the requests not to do
so. The trustees know, though, the name
of every giver. I can say that Marshall
Field's contribution was J135.000. and that
Mrs. BlaJne gave J27.000 and Mrs. Foster
$20,000."
The total endowment of the college Is
now 111 .000.000.

tain cases where there was a keen rivalry
between the roads they had made him
special allowances, though this never
came in the form of what he called re
bates, but as additional mileage allow
ances. He could not remember any of the
roads which had made such allowances,
except the Clover Leaf Line, which had
been brought into the hearing by Presi
dent Naftzger of the Fruit Exchange.
Acting President Clements protested
against leaving this road to stand the
brunt of making- the allowances alone,
when the testimony showed that many
Eastern roads must have made similar
allowances. The name of no other road
was brought out.
The witness stated that his express line
has no term contracts with other roads
than the Santa Fe Pacific and the South
ern Pacific, the initial lines in the ship
ments of citrus fruit?, though he could
not be brought to state just what the
nature of contracts with other roads 1?.
The witness stated that for several
years he had not given his personal at
tention to the affairs of the fruit com
pany. In which he stated tljat he owns 45
per cent of the stock, because he Is giving
his time to the continental fruit express,
in which he said he owns 90 per cent of
the stock. Later he stated that his
knowledge of the actual working of the
express line was limited to the reports
submitted to htm by hi 3 employes, this
unfortunate combination of circumstances
preventing him answering many questions
propounded by the Commissioners and
the attorneys.
Value of the Cars.

average earning capacity of J^o per year
net. though he -could not tell what the
gross earning power of the care is.
He declared that the money which he
prevlouÂ«lv paid out In rebates now re
mains In the treasury of the express line.
The charge had been repeatedly made
; by witness apralnst the Continental Ex
' press that that company has agents all
' over the country, who can report to the
Â¦ Earl Fruit Company the movements of
â¢ car.s, and that that company has facili
j ties for learning the details of the buÂ«l
j ness of other shippers and sending fruit
Â¦ in ahead of Its competitors, by diversion,
! greatly to the damage of the latter. Mr.
I Earl was questioned regarding the rep
i resentatives of the Continental Fruit Ex
Â¦ press through the country and h*> stated
; that the express has men at about twenty
! Icing stations In different parts of the
' country, who look after all of the com
j pany's" cars passing those points, icins
or ventilating them and that each of the=e
j makes a daily report to the express com

j Fruit Company had any information re
i garding the movements of cars which
j other shippers did not have.
The railroad companies waived the right
to introduce witnesses as did also the
other car lines and with the reservation
i that all parties to the controversy have

It was agreed by all parties that there

Earl Admits Giving Rebates.
LOS ANGELES. March 31.â F. T. Fay
of the Fay Fruit Company this morning
testified before the Interstate Commerce
Commission that in January last he
hauled oranses from Covina, on the
Southern Pacific line, to Azusa, on the
Santa Fe Railrcad. loading a car and ask
ing that it be sent to Chicago via the
Santa Fe. He was refused this privilege,
and E. Chambers, general freight agent
of the Santa Fe. was interviewed several
times, the latter Insisting that it would
be unfair to the Southern Pacific road for
the Santa Fe Company to accept fruit
which had been grown on the line of the
other road. He had telegraphic corre
spondence with President Ripley and Vice
President Morton at the time regarding
the arbitrary methods of the railroads,
and had thus been advised that Chambers
was fully conversant with the policy of
the Santa Fe managers.
The witness testified that he has re
ceived rebates from the three fruit car
lines doing business in California, both
Â¦when cars were refrigerated and when
they were not, the rebates ranging from
?10 to iM, the latter being for refrigerated
cars to the extreme East.
Samuel Westfall of Wcstfall Bros, said
that his company has had rebates for
several years from the car lines, and for
one short period they received a rebate
frcm K. Hosbury, livestock agent of the
Toledo. St. Louis and Western Ilailroad.
who paid him in drafts on a Toledo bank,
paying him In hand.
Leland Lyon of Ftedlands testified that
his company has received rebates from
fruit car line comsianies for orange ship
ment? and small rtrbates from Eastern
roads, particularly the Clover Leaf line.
He said that he had felt that the Earl
Fruit Company protits rrom the C. F. X.
car lino to such an extent that it is only
a question of timo wh'-n he or other ship
pers are driven from the fruit business.
Secretaries of a number of local fruit
exchanges testified that they have pro
tested againat C. F. X. cars, on the
ground that they did not to put their
affairs in the hands of a competitor, but
the railroads have forced them to use
the cars.
Earl on the Stand.
The afternoon session was taken up
particularly by testimony of E. Earl,
president of the Earl Fruit Company and
the Continental Fruit Exchange, his tes
timony closing the session in this city
and the case at issue.
Earl was Ted to admit that he has paid
rebates to the shippers of citrus fruits,
explaining the payments by saying that
there was litigation and keen rivalry be
tween the car lines and that it was neces
sary for him to make ihe payments to
pet the business. He was put through
rigid questioning by the Commissioners
as to the source from which the money
came which enabled him to pay the re
bates, and he stated that he received a
mileage generally from the Eastern roads
of three-quarters of a cent, and in cer-

thank for averting a murder. She was
put on the stnr.d to testify in rebuttal,
and declared that on one occasion her
husband had sworn he intended to search
for Ed Christie immediately ar.d kill him
to save the honor of his home.
"I told him if he went I was going.
too." said Mrs. Finlc "Tozether we
crossed the bay and saw Mr. Christie.
Explanations were so simple thai my hus
band was satisfied and we came* home
without the consummation of his deadly
threat. On this occasion he carried a.
knife."
On cross-examination the plaintiff de
r.ied that she had flourished a revolver
on this occasion, remarking with empha
sis that if she ha-J flourished a pistol she
woulii have used It.
Another feature of the case was the
testimony of A. W. Fink Jr.. the 17-year
old son of the couple, who with his sis
ter is ranged on his mother's side of the
sensational legal contest. He denied the
statement made yesterday on the stand by
Fir.k that Mrs. Fir.k had or.cc mot by ap
pointme-r.t a young man at the Orpheum
Theater. He said the mtetinc was en
tirely accidental.
The case was virtually concluded to
day, as J<"':srÂ« i Hall postponed further pro
ceedings until May 1. In order to permit a
transcript to be taken of the testimony.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, â¢ SUNDAY, APRIL 1, 1900.
FAMOUS ARCHAEOLOGIST
OF BERKELEY MUSEUM
PROFESSOR ALFRED EMERSON.
the most celebrated archaeologist of
American birth, â¢who was sum
moned from Paris by Mrs. Phebe A.
Hearst, is in frequent consultation with
her regarding- the excavations which are
to be undertaken in Greece to enrich the
museum of classical art and archaeology
which Mrs. Hearst proposes to establish
in Berkeley.
During the few -weeks which Professor
Emerson will spend In California the clas
sical scholars of the two universities are
making the most of the privilege of dis
cussing things Greek with him. He is also
to deliver a few lectures. On Saturday
evenings, beginning April 6. Dr. Emerson
will deliver a series of lectures at the San
Francisco Academy of Sciences on "Greek
Decorative and Pictorial Sculpture." The
lectures will be Illustrated by lantern
views, which have been bought especially
for this purpose. Dr. Emerson will also
lecture before the students at the univer
sity. He will deliver four lectures on
Greek vases at Hearst Hall and a series
of lectures on Greek sculpture at the Me
chanics' building. These, too. will be il
lustrated by lantern views. Professor Em
erson has things of the most fascinating:
Interest to tell regarding his experiences
in digging for the burled treasures of
Greek art. Few living men have enjoyed
so unique an experience as he.
Dr. Emerson is an archaeologist by de
liberate choice. He began his preparation
for -work at an early ape. spending two
years in Athens while still in his fens
that he might karn modern Greek. As a
result he sp^ak* the lar.srua.ee with a flu
enev equaled by few. If any. other Ameri
can pcholarsl Frof^sor Emerson might
be called a precursor of the American
school of classical studies in Athrn?.
which dates only from l^Sl. He studied
classical philology In Munich under the
famous Latin critic Karl Halm, and Yon
Christ the leading contemporary author
ity on ancient meter. He also studied
archaeology under the late Professor
Brur.n. at that time the formost German
archaeologist. He took hi? Ph. D. at the
University of Munich in ISBL
The professor has taugrht in several of
the leading universities of America. Includ
ing the Johns Hopkins University and
Cornell University. While at Correll he
organized a museum of classical archae
ology, which ranks as the largest and
richest university museum of this kind in
25
the United States. He has excavated a
Greek temple at Croton. Italy. lois<i^K

THIRD CONCERT
OF PADEREWSKI
The attendance and enthusiasm at the
Pederewski concerts are growing percep
tibly, and the pianist was more cordially
received than ever by a large audience at
the California Theater Friday afternoon.
The programme btgan with a prelude
and fugue (Bach-Liszt), to which the
player brought the dependable qualities of
superior musicianship. One of the most
melodious and unhackneyed sonatas of
Beethoven (Op. 31, No. 2) followed, after
which Mr. Paderewski attacked the gi
gantic Schuman, "Carnival." a composi
tion that tests severely the physical and
mental powers of the performer. It was
given a reading full of originality and in
terest, although I was disappointed In the
climax, the march of the Davidsbuendler,
which was not given the musical breadth
that Saver put into it.
The Chopin fantasia, F minor, op. 43
was brilliantly executed, and in the fa
miliar "Raindrop" preluile Paderewakl ex
hibited a fine ?ense of light and shade,
giving a new interest to the composition.
In the C sharp minor valse he played with
the utmost dexterity and a pianissimo
finer than usual, but In this and the Valse
Brilliante, which he gave for encore, as
well as the mazurka which followed, he
missed the e.iijulsite dance rhythm of Do
Pachmann, whom I regard as the superior
to Paderewski in that quality alone.
The Chopin scherzo, C sharp minor, op.
20, was almost a feature, so charmingly
was it played, the artist's treatment of the
gracious melody toward the close of this
number being most effective. After the
A minor barcarrclle of Rubinstein, Pader
ewski gave his own popular minuet with
f mbelllshmcnt?. and closed the pro
gramme with IJFzt's "Twelfth Hungarian
Rhapsodle" with his accustomed bril
liance. The last Paderewski concert will
take place at the California Theater on
Monday afternoon next at 2:30 o'clock.

tion, something that has never before oc
curred in that or ar.y other fraternal
order In this city. It is stated that the
six fathers will be asked to fill the several

The Junior Order.
U. S. Grant Council of the Junior Order
of United American Mechanics was some
what astonished during the recent session
of the State Council to discover that Its
team did not carry away the trophy. The
members had drilled until they were of
the opinion that they were perfect. Dur
ing the competition the guard work was
undoubtedly the best from the manner in
which it was applauded, but, unfortunate
ly, this team was at fault in some points
of the ritualistic work, and Unity Council
of San Jose having excelled, got away
with the trophy. After the competition it
was announced that Dr. Derrick of Custer
Council had offered a trophy, to cost $25.
to be competed for at the next session of
the State Council.

Averill delivered an interesting address.

It Is net a back-yard affair or In the busl-
ntws temporarily.
It Is not doing a brokerage business, buying
where they can pick up a Job lot, but breed
their own stock, their breeding bucko and
does having b^en ppeclally selected by their
Mr. HarrU In England.
Remember that every Belgian Hare leaving
our establishment Is guaranteed to be as rep-
resented.
Our personal reliability any one can learn

Who is paying rent can pay for a home; It
takes no more money monthly than what goes
to the landlord, and In a very few years he
has paid for and owr\s the hornÂ«. which If he
had rented he would never have owned.
Look over the old rent receipts that you
have accumulated and ask yourself what good
are they.
For the rent money that you now throw
away I can give you a new modern home with
every convenience and built to last; take Mis-

CHICAGO, March 31.â The Wheat market to
day concluded a month which has boosted the
price of May Wheat up l%3lftc in a very quiet
manner. In vain did holders point to the higher ;
cables from Liverpool, and, again without ef
fect, to the reports of damages by rain to the
Argentine crop. Those who were selling se
renely colled attention to the liberal receipts,
the fine weather and the crop prospects, which
point to bulging bins at the end of next sum
mer's harvest. So there was not the demand
to-day that characterized yesterday's session,
and there seemed to be plenty for sale, but It
was not a large speculative market. At the
opening there was a short-winded upward
spurt on the bullish considerations, but there
after It waa the other way. Export sales wera
light, . but seaboard clearances in Wheat and
Flour were equal to 622,000 bushels. The cosh
demand waa slack.
The Corn market had some strength early be
cause, of the higher cables from Liverpool and
the usual light country offerings, May selling
at 890 several times, but this was lost. The
weather probably actod along with a desire for
profits in causing liquidation. May closed H'fj
ftc under yesterday.
The Oats market yielded with other grains,
the feature of the trade being the selling of
both July and May by a cash house. May closed
*i.c lower.
There waa nothing llko a repetition of the ac
tivity of the recent days in the Provisions pit
to-day. The market was easier, too. Hcga
were generally weaker. There waa pront-taklng
and some selling on stop-loss orders, and less
of an outside demand than during the period
which carried May Pork for rains of more than
$1. Liverpool was lower for Lard. The feature
of the trade was tho demand for May Ribs
May Pork closed 100 under yesterday; May
1-tf.rd 5c lower, and May Rlbe 7fto lower.

NEW YORK. March 31.â The Financier says:
The New York banks made an unexpectedly
good showinsr for the week ending March 31,
surplus reserves having risen $1,018,850, or to
$9,536\150. The gain was entirely In the form
of cash, as both loans and deposits' expanded
for the first time In a number of weeks. The
increase in loans amounted to $3.280,900^ â a very
moderate advance when the activity of the
Etock market is taken into consideration. This
increase, coupled with the addition of $5,943,900
to the banks' receipts of cash, account for the
rise of $7,700,200 in deposits, and as the latter
in turn called for an additional reserve of al
most $2,00O,<Â») the excess reserve does not show
as heavy an advance as would have been the
cose otherwise. The statement is much more
favorable than had been anticipated, but it is
rather difficult to trace the origin of the heavy
receipts ot cash. It is known that the banks
received something like $1,500,000 from the treas
ury, but the interior receipts were not so heavy.
Onu million In gold came from Cuba during
the week, but this does not figure to the full
extent In the statement. One feature of the
statement that Is worthy of attention is the
gain of $875,900 In national bank net circula
tion, the total Issues of notes standing at pres
ent at $20,136,600. This does not represent the
total applications already made, and it is an
ticipated that Increases will be noted regu
larly hereafter. While this of itself does not
imply lower rates for money the only deduction
possible is that quotations will remain easy
for a considerable period. A factor not to be
Ignored is the advance in foreign exchange rates
over the past week or two. Various explana
tions have been advanced for this, but the fact
remains that easisr money here will make xor
a continuance of a higher exchange level.
The banks ought to continue to gain from the
treasury as an incident to the refunding opera
tions, and even though Europe may continue to
purchase American securities the experiment of
"adding an unknown number of millions to the
current money of the country is apt to lead
to some very curious complications In exchange
markets. Normally the only outlet for too
much money Is export or a wild inflation ot
speculative values here. Neither may occur,
but If too much bank money la Issued either is
possible. .
London Market.
NEW YORK. March 81.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The boat race Interfered with the markets
here to-day, but the tone was firm. Americans
are rising quietly. Atchison preferred and
Wabaeh bonds were most in demand. Paris Is
still buying Tlntos at 58%. The Bank of Eng
land bought Â£23,000 in gold bars. There was
a big turn over In the money market on ac
count of the end of the quarter, but ample
preparations had been made. The Bank of
England did a small business and half the
amount was renewed. Paris cheques, 25.20.

Dried Fruit in New York.
The New York Commercial says: "Prunes
were the mo*t Interesting variety in the list,
â¢r3 there were sales apgre^ating several cars,
though a ICÂ»X>-cas* lot was the largest known
to- have changed hinds at any one time.
Prices were firmer afterward and have not
yet receded to their original position. The
quantity ht-ld here is said to be around eighty
cars, fully one hundred less than at this time
last season. There are only comparatively
*:r.a!l lots in first han^s in California, which
has a tendency to crt-ate a stronger market.
The full effect of it will not be fell until
s-.me one buys out a few small holders, who
are compelled to turn thrlr goods into money
â¢rbea needed and consequently prices are some
what unsettled.
"Peaches have become firmer through the
Â»Â«^k, though no holder hÂ«s yet advanced his
quotations. There is less disposition to get
rid "f holdings, regardless of consequirfices,
and there is more evidence of a belief that
the. market will improve shortly. Cheap stocks
are in drmand, bat difficult to obtain, and
the supply of desirable goods is not large,
hÂ»-nce the basis of the confidence which is
thown by all.
"Apricots wll in a small way from second
hands, but Inasmuch as second hands are ln
differrnt sellers and buyers are unwilling to
pay the price asked business continues small."

Associated Banks' Statement.
New York Stock Market.
ifBW YORK, March Sl.â Wall KreÂ«t was
treated to an agreeable surprise to-day in an !
unexpectedly fa\-orabie barJc Â«t&tÂ«-mertt. The
moet sexgulne preliminary estimate of the gain
in each by the banks for the week on interior
currency movement and the subtre*Â«ury opera
tions Hi not excÂ«*d $2,500,000. The actual re
turn shows a gain of nearly J5. 000,000. The ex
planation of this large Increase in cash is cot
eaÂ«-;:y perceptible. It n.ay be due to the fact
that the ehipmenui ot currency to the interior
by the banks have included a large proportion
cf their new note issues, uhlle the receipts have
b*en ir.aÂ£Â« up of leÂ«al tender*. The process of
sorting thus involved would wield a larger re
turn to the banks of cash available for reserve
than would b*> Indicated In the bare figures of
excess of receipts over shipments on the In
terior movement. It would be by some such
process that the new bank notes will displace
the legal tenders In actual circulation and thus
make them available for remerve purposes of the
It-'. Another passible txplanation of the ln
cr*a*e la ca*h is that loans have been paid oft
in cash. The loan item shows that the new
<*.Â«racd en the banks for stock market opera
tions and for April Ist settlements has more
than offset the liquidation of loans for holding
Government bonds designed to use as security
lor note issues. The result Is a loÂ«ua expansion
Had it not t*en for the nnexp*>ct<s<Jiy largÂ«
gain In cash, the lncrÂ©aÂ«Â« in reserve require
ments thus involved would have made an ln
ro&d upon the surplus. It was some fear cf this
showing that caused yesterday's hesitation and
uneasiness in the etock market. The same feel
ir.g wae perceptible to some extent in the early
trading to-day, but it gave way to the renewed
buying demand, especially for the Iron and
Bteel FtooJcs. and after the publication of the
bank staU-ment the strvngth became general
cm 4 The market closed active and strong at sub

bt-trs m f-urar were relieved from their panic
of yesterday by the assertions of officials of tht
company that th* Sugar war was still on. But
professional traders handled new short con
tracts !n Sugar in a jringerly manner. The

did not ret within more than a point of as low

Steamer Movements.
I the list of railroad stocks. Many stocks. In
which no transaction had been recorded for
months, have been brought forward to a con
spicuous place In the trading and the number
of different stocks traded in haa amounted up
to ISO or 170 on a single day, showing the great
j breadth of the market. The average day's
j business has been close to a million shares, and
j although there has been some congestion of
! business in stocks of the great railroad sys
tems, the activity in the main haa been un
â¢ usually well distributed. The stocks of Indus
trial corporations have not shared In the
j strength of railroads, but have, on the contrary,
reflected pressure to sell until the shorts were
j driven to cover late in the week. Those which
I have shown greatest weakness have been af
Â¦ fected by special causes, but the tone of the
i Industrials generally showed that they are be
j lleved to be vulnerable to the same causes of
I weakness as those directly affected. The large
1 and general buying of railroad securities can
I only be explained as due to confidence in the
soundness of values at th# present level of
prices. The level of intrinsic values in securi-
I ties naturally varies with the prevailing Inter-
I est rate, active business and opportunities for
i profitable use of money, these tending to bring
. securities to market to realize funds for use In
! the money market. The effects now In evidence
1 of the operation of the new bank currency and
Government bond refunding law give assurance
that Use needs of the very active trade all over
the country for a circulation medium will be
Money reserves of banks are thus guarded
atralnst encroachment and security holders feel
Insured against a rise in interest rates, which
would depreciate the value of returns on their
holdings. Added to this is the assurance that
the present rate of earningÃ of railroads must
maintain an Increased distribution of profits to
stockholders and additions to the value of
equities of railroad stocks.
While the present large volume of earnings of
railroads is due to the large general traffic
which is transported, the conservative course of
railroad management in accumulating surpluses
and in making liberal outlays frr permanent
improvements out of the present large profits
gives a feeling of confidence to stockholders in
the continuity of the return on their holdings.
The tendency of the railroad managements In
the last few years to make heavy outlays for
permanent works on the roadways is bearing
fruit in the reduced requirements of renewals
of structures and work of like nature still In
progress and promise of still further relief in
the future. Constant Improvements In motive
power and in equipment are also having their
effect in the increase in train load and increase
in the ton mile cost of transportation. The sub
stantial value thus added to railroads, the high
credit attained, making, possible the refunding
or renewal of mortgages at Increased Interest
charges, the extension of. control or influence
; over competing lines and the prosperous busl- j
, ness conditions in the country â these form a I
! solid basis for the improvements in prices of I
â¢ the railroad ptocks and bonds. The demand has I
j cv>me alike from ("peculators for a rise, from I
I investors and from foreign buyers. The foreign j
i demand hap been a prominent feature of the j
' week and has aroused much discussion as to
i whether it represents renewed fixture of for
: el?n capital in American securities. The con
, victlon has grown up that this buying is large- ]
ly speculative with a view to Belling out on a
rise. The upward movement of sterling ex- I
change in favor of London buying of securities, j
which has amounted to 1 cent in the pound i
during the week, disclosed that remittances
were not being made for the foreign buying. I
but holdings were being carried by loans secured '
in New York. Much diversity of statement and I
opinion has been elicited from foretgn broker
age housee as to the actual shipments of securl- I
tlt-s which are being made to London. But they
j seem agreed that they are by no means as large j
j as recent purchases of stocks attributed to Lon- j
| don account. In London there is some dl!>
poMtlon to attribute the demand for and
i Ptrenrth of American securities to the account
j of American operators, who use the London
; market in perference to New York for reason* '
j b*>Bt known to themselves. In the Industrial Met I
I the Immediate causes of weakness have beÂ»n '
I the gloomy forebodings emitted by the presl-
I der.t of the American Sugar Refining Company
! of the prospective reduction In dividends neces
] sitated by destructive trade competition and the
. heavy valuations for taxation placed upon N>w
York public franchisee. Thit ao well Intrenched
and so long successful an industrial combina
tion of the sugar company should officially ad
mit that comoetltion had deprived Its busi
ness of any profit pave a check to the confidence
of holders of stocks in other industrial com- 1
binatlons in the power of such combination to |
prevent or defeat new and destructive com- !
petition. The squeeze of the shorts in sugar
did not dissipate this sentiment. |
The buyirur of railroad bonds ran up to very j
large proportions during, the week. The mar- I
kf-t was very broad, but the largest demand
was for low-priced bonds, whose security Is !
Increased by an added surplus of earnings, or
on which the return is contingent upon in
creased earnings.

of, and thÂ« Fire Department suffered no Injury
through any part of our eiectrtc system that
could possibly- be avoided.
All of the trouble that did occur was largely
Jf not entirely due to thÂ» electric-light wire*
coming down with the telephone and Market
street Railway Company's wires across our
wire, which was dead; and any current that
may have been in our wire was due to causes
entirely beyond our control.
I think it only fair to this company that we
should have the privilege of stating the facts
In this particular case. YourÂ«t very truly

To Chief Sullivan. San Francisco Fire Depart
ment. San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: I Inclose you
a copy of a letter which I have sent to Chief
of Police Sullivan this day. It was sent to him
rather than to yourself solely because we had
received a telephone message purporting to
come from the Chief of Police ordering us to
shut down our power house during the fire last
night. Its object is to show:
1. That Immediately upon receiving the order
we shut down our line east of Thirtieth street.
2. That at the time that we received the or
der our line on Bryant street, from Eighth,
between Harrison and Bryant, to Second street,
had been dead for some time.
3. That if any current or any shock was
riven by our wire it was due to Its belnc
crossed with electric light, telephone and the
Market-etreet Railway Company's wires.
I desire to add that any time we receive a

San Mateo Railway Manag
ers Tell the Facts About
Recent Fire.
Firemen Were Injured Through, the
Refusal of the Former Corpora
tion to Cut Its Current
When Ordered.
As yet the Market-street Railway Com
pany has not seen fit to explain Its action
in refusing to cut off the current from
Its trolley lines during the progress of the
fire at Eighth and Bryant streets Friday
evening. Through the action of the Mar
ket-street Company in either negligently
failing or deliberately refusing to cut off
the current several persons narrowly es
caped death, and the lives of all of the
firemen and spectators within the lines
were Imperiled. Two communications
from the San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railway Company were received
by Chief of Police Sullivan yesterday,
which explain the fact that the current
from this company's wires was cut as
soon as possible after the fire started, and
also make plain the fact that the Market-
Street Company made no effort to lessen
the danger to which liremen are con
stantly exposed when 'fighting the names
surrounded by Â¦ a network of heavily
charged wires. The communications re
ferred to read:
March 31, 1900.
To Chief of Police Sullivan, City Hall, city-
Dear Sir: Subject, fire at Bryant and Eighth
streets. I desire to make a simple statement
to you In regard to our wires, in connection
with the flre last night. Some messages were
sent to our power house In your name, ami 1
note in this morning's papers the charge that
we failed to obey the order to shut of! our cur
rent. . â¢
At the moment that the alarm rang in our
electrician, Mr. Vanatta, was on a car on top
of Kighteenth-street hill on his way to the
power house. Instead of going there he boarded
one of our cars at Guerrero street and contin
ued'on down to the (ire. Shortly after he had
readied it one of the buildings fell in. At this
time he was trying to make his way to our
brraker situated on Eighth street, between Har
rison and liryant. iie informs me that our
wires had not In any way interfered with the
Hremen up to the time that he arrived at the
tire, but almost immediately after his arrival,
owing to the falling in of one of the buildings,
amass of wires consisting of electric light wires,
telephone wires, with the Market-street Rail
way Company's and our own, came down In one
confusing -mass into the street. At this time he
was on Ills way to cut our line, and used every
possible dispatch, cutting out our line very
shortly afterward. Immediately upon cutting
it out at Eighth street we blew the fuse at
Bryant and Second streets, and. our wire from
that time on was absolutely dead all al^ng
Bryant street. Subsequent to our line being
cut out we received a telephone message pun
porting to come from Chief of Police Sullivan,
and immediately upon its receipt our whole
downtown section was cut out from the power
house, which Includes everything east of Thirti
eth street and San Jose avenue. There was not
the slightest delay In cutting out the moment
our power house was advised. The shutting
down of the main line was absolutely unneces
sary, as at the time we shut down our line on
Bryant street had been cut for some time. We
have no feed wires at all on Bryant street. Our
service on that street consists of a single trol
ley wire, which Is fed from our Harrison -street
feeders at Eighth street and Stanley place.
We did not start up our main line until our
electrician advised the power house to cut in
again, when we continued to serve our cars on
Harrison street only, our Bryant-street liHe re
maining dead. The Bryant street line was not
cut In until tlje majority of the fire companies
were ordered from;the fire and our linemen, to
gether with those of the Market-street Railway
Company, had made sufficient repairs to Insure
the safety of the public.
We probably rendered a more prompt service
at this fire than is ueual with us, for the reason
that , our ' electrician happened Â» to be traveling
on the line at the time the alarm was turned in.
We know from the fact of his being" so early, In
the field that our line was promptly taken care
the last Saturday In April, on which occa
sion the vice presidents and advisory
board members will be elected.
The officers chosen yesterday were as
follows: Honorary presidents, Mrs. PhebÂ«

GOOD SALES OF REALTY
THERE have been a number of fair
ly good sales of real estate closed
during the past week, but the only
deal of more than ordinary impor
tance is the purchase of the Pacific
Rolling Mills property by the Risdon Iron
Works for something over half a million
dollars, news of which was first published
in The Call. The transfer of this valua
ble property means a great deal for the
Potrero and San Francisco generally, as
it is proposed to establish a great ship
building plant there as a rival to the Un
ion Iron Works, involving the expenditure
of several million dollars and giving em
ployment to several thousand mechanics
and laborers.
Thomas Magee & Sons have sold to
Henry Kahn two valuable pieces of prop
erty on Eddy street for nearly $60,000. The
first piece was that of Mrs. Raphael at
115 Eddy street, adjoining the panorama
building on the southwest corner of Eddy
and Mason streets, lot 25x137:6, for $27,300.
The other piece was the adjoining prop
erty on Eddy street, 30x137:6. owned by
John Pforr, for which $30,0<)0 was paid.
This purchase leads the way to the de
velopment of lower Eddy street, which
has as great if not greater advantages
than Ellis street, where Henry Kahn and
his associate, Leon Kauff man, have erect
ed handsome business structures, one of
which has been sold at an advance on
the investment, and the other, the prop
erty of Thomas Magee Jr. and Henry
Kahn, has been leased on terms that will
repay the outlay on land and building.
Shainwald, Buckbee & Co. have sold the
J. C. Johnson residence property on the
southwest corner of Van Ness avenue and
California street to Dr. Albert Abram for
$40,000, subject to confirmation by the Pro
bate Court. JThe lot has a frontage on
the avenue o9 60 feet and extends 134 feet
on California" street. The premises were
sold in UBSS by the heirs of John Campbell
for $34,000 to the late J. C. Johnson, who
expended, it ia eaid, nearly $30,000 in trans
forming the residence Into what he
termed the West Indian style, with tur
rets and ornamentations on the exterior
and corresponding arrangements in the
Interior. Should the Probate Court accept
his offer It is Dr. Abrama' Intention to ex
pend about $SOOO in fitting up the rear por
tion of the building on California street
for offices and a laboratory, with distinct
ar.d separate entrance from the residence
proper.
The estate of Charles Behlow has pur
chased of Mrs. Lizette M. Nelson the
