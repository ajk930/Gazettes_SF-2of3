and he robbed me. The entire scheme was
concocted by him. Rideout and Boots
were simply dummies used by him for
their names and for the prestige which
they received from their family connec

honest work on the books and bank ac
counts.
"When I was Induced to enter the
company by him as a stockholder I
thought so well of It that I persuaded
others to go in with me. My brother-in
law took some stock; ray wife bought
some; my wife's sister and aunt took
some and so did others until our interests
represented many thoiisands of dolllars.
When I found out that I was being robbed
I consulted my attorney. R. M. Fitzger

the books. Mr. Fitzgerald told me Jocu

defunct California Packing Company.
Cote insists that he. has not been In hid

says he is at his office every day and can
be found there when any one wants him.
He declared last night that he can show
conclusively that every dollar spent by
his company was legitimately expended,

It Is charged that the arch manipulator
duped several wealthy men and women
Into what, appeared to be a legitimate
business venture. Having secured thou
thousands upon thousands of dol
lars King, it is claimed set about
to rob the investors, falsifying the
records of the corporation, using relatives
of promlnent'bankers and business men as
dummies, manipulating, bank books and
accounts so as to misrepresent the finan
cial standing of the concern, and then
filching the money which rightfully be
longed to the corporation.
For many months this gigantic system
of duplicity and fraud was maintained
with success. So craftily did King manip
ulate the books that no suspicion was
excited in the minds of the duped in
vestors. One day. however, a false play
was made, an investigation was instituted
and the crash came. The deluded in
vestors were. forced to steal the books
of the corporation and found upon in
specting them that they had been robbed
of $22,000. King and his associates were
forced to refund most of the money and
were then kicked out of the corporation.
For the sake of those that had been in
jured and with a view of protecting the
credit of the corporation at a critical
stage of its existence King was not pros
ecuted. : -~' " ' r ;-
Charles J. King is a remarkable char

versatility, and while he is a gentleman

King of William, a prominent merchant,
who made history in San Francisco In the
days of the Vigilantes and who. It wiil
be remembered, was murdered by Casey
during a local reign of lawlessness and
terror. Charles J. King has occupied a
position of honor in San Francisco for
many years. He was looked upon as a
man above reproach In commercial and
social life and his probity was the stand
ard of emulation among his fellows. De
vout to a marked degree, he set an ex

BOERS SLEW NATIVES
IN OPEN COMBAT
LONDON. April . 23.â A Boer dispatch
from Glencoe, Natal, dated Tuesday, April
24, says that four scouts surprised 300
British from Lftdjrsalth April 22 and put
the whole body to Ilight and captured two
of them.
The arrival of Mafeking dispatches has
renewed the interest and anxiety in re-
sard to 'the fate of its defenders. Lady
Sarah Wilson's account of the slaughter
of thirty-three natives who went out from
Ma f eking last Friday to recover some
cattle which had been looted by the BoÂ«ri
and who while they were sleeping were
surrounded by burghers and shot without
quarter, apparently harshly misrepresent
ed the action of the Boers. A dispatch
received by the "Associated Press from
Mafeking say? that the natives in ques
tion were unauthorized raiders and that
Instead of being ruthlessly slaughtered by
Boors while asleep they beat back the
burghers, who were obliged to get rein
forcements. The dispatch adds:
"There was no question of surrender.
The loader of the natives, a tall, spare
man. rallied his meij to the last, and the
fight progressed from the' rising to the
sinking of the sun. Those -twenty-five
Fingoes. armed v.ith obsolete rifles, fought
with grim desperation. Machine guns and
Mausers poured shot and shell Into their
midst. Until their ammunition was ex
hausted the natives fought and then the
Boer? killed all but one of them, who,
wounded, hid In the reeds and escaped.
"General Snyman complained of Colonel
Baden-Powell employing barbarians who
killed six and wounded numbers of Boers.
Colonel Baden-Powell replied that the
raid was unauthorized and pointed out
that a number of natives were destitute
before their homes had been burned and
their cattle stolen by the Beers. He de
clined to be held responsible for the na
tives' actions."
The correspondent concludes: "Mafe
king may be forgiven If It begs to prefer
some attempt at relief rather than empty
congratulations for its gallant stand.
Though there is only sufficient to keep

render. It is very weary of it all."

quickly put to flight, leaving the field
strewn with armor. Their riflemen were
unable to shoot straight and the bolomen
never got near enough to the Americans
to do any execution. Therefore none of

that Lord Roberts' enveloping operations

north. King told him that a ship and
some barges were In course of construc
tion and with a llttlo more money the
company would be able to begin active
and successful business. Rideout, he
said, was president of the company and
the genial King was secretary and man
ager.
The project suggested Itself to Fish as
an admirable one. He invested $5000 and
his partner advanced the same amount.
They interested their friends and In a
short time, through their advocacy of the
scheme, their friends were Involved to an
amount between $40,000 and $50,000 in ex
change for which they received stock In
the corporation. Meanwhile the beat and
the barges were building at Stockton and
King was handling the books of the com
pany. Fish and his friend 3 received no
representation on the board of directors
nor did they desire any, as they trusted
Implicitly, through the confidence of Fish,
in the integrity of King. Affairs went
along smoothly for some time. There was
plenty of money In the bank, so tne books
showed, and apparent progress was being
made In the construction of the boats.
One day Fish was In the office of the
company when a bill was presented and
the secretary declined to pay it, claiming
the customary sixty days' time. Fish ask
ed why It was not discounted and received
no satisfactory reply. He became sus
picious and determined to make an in
vestigation. He went to Stockton and
found that the contractors were not mak
ing progress en the boat because they
had not received their money. The books
of the California Yukon Trading Company
showed that the contractors had already
received thousands of dollars. Fraud of
the grossest kind had been perpetrated
and the crime had been committed in the
office of the company.
Fish lost no time in pursuing his inves
tigations. He consulted with the firm
which was building the engines and the
boilers for the ship and found that very
little money had been paid there on ac
count. Fish concluded that he was being
robbed. He consulted with his attorney.
Robert M. Fitzgerald of Oakland, and
suggested that the only way In which he
could tell how he was being robbed and
to what extent was to secure possession
of the books, and the only way to obtain
possession was bj* stealing the books.
This course was decided upon, and one
night Fish and a- friend entered the of
fice of the company at G32 Market street
and stole the books, taking them to Fish's
apartments in the Palace Hotel. There
a- minute and careful examination of the
records was made and a startling condl-

the San Jose merchant. King was not
long in unfolding his scheme. He had a
magnificent prospect in view, he said, and
wanted Fish to derive some benefit
from it.

Austrian press. 'The Neve Freie Presse
remarks that since the Spanish war the
Americans seem to have lost all respect
for Europe and It comments at great
length upon the "new aspects that threat
en to intrude on European politics when
America feels strong enough to threaten
a European state with a naval demon
stration." This Journal then goes on to
say:
"It Is difficult to conceive what practi
cal advantage would accrue to the United
States from participation in the eastern
question, but it will be a disagreeable sur
prise to Russia to find in America a new
rival in a domain which Russia has al
ways regarded as her traditional inherit
ance."
The Neve Winer Tageblatt. In a similar
article, says: "America as a great power
has been too long left out of account.
American imperialism may involve many
perils for the American Union Itself, but
it is far more dangerous for other states."

powers in getting money from Turkey and
adds:
"Through the payment to the American
missionaries, the Sultan is reminded that
a new element, expressing itself in unac

The Berliner Tageblatt thinks that the

Says That the Sultan of Turkey Will
Keep All the Promises He :
Ever Made.
AUSTIN. Tex.. April 25.â When asked
to-day for an expression as to the merits
of the United States' claim against Tur
key for indemnity for the burning of mis
sionary property during the Armenian
trouble. ex-United States Minister A. W.
Terrell, now residing in this city, gave out
the following interview:
I entirely agree with General Lew Wallace
in Ms estimate of the Sultan of Turkey. There
Is much Ignorance about the nature of our
claims against Turkey. We claim indemnity
tqr the burning of missionary property at Har
poct and Marash. places then dominated by
Kurds and a fanatical populace. And remote
at the time from Consular protection. Mis
sionaries claim that the burning was done with
the aid or connivance of Turkish soldiers. The
Porte has insisted that it was done by Kurds
and by an fingovernable mob. Our claim is
sustained by circumstances resting on mission
ary evidence, the denial of the Turks is
sustained by official reports by the Turkish offi
cers and Pashas, and the issue of the fact has
not been settled by an Impartial tri
bunal. The burning was done during the Ar
menian massacres, and the Kurds have been
the enemies of the Armenians from the time of
Xenophen.
Healthy public sentiment should protect the
President In his foreign diplomacy against the
spirit of religious Intolerance. I pressed our
claim for indemnity to the utmost limit of
friendly diplomacy while in Turkey, if the
Sultan has "ever promised to pay It he will
keep his word, and If he ever made the prom

LONDON. April 26.â The Constantinople

"The Porte considers that its offer to

bases this belief on news that Russia has
intimated an intention to oppose any at
tempt on the part of the United States to

Inquiries made at the British Foreign

that in view of the steps taken by the
United States regarding claims arising
out of the Armenian massacres the em
bassies of Great Britain. France. Austria,
Italy and Germany have asked their Gov
ernments to Instruct them as to their
similar claims. It is also learned that the
British Government has not yet answered
its Embassador's request for instructions
and contemplates individual action.
While the attitude of her Majesty's Gov
ernment is one of regret that the British
claims have come to this stage, it will
co-operate in any plan decided upon by
the other powers concerned. It is not be
lieved at the Foreign Office, however, that
joint action will take the form of an ulti
matum or result in anything except the
renewal of useless protestations to the

be treated on the same basis as the United

was pleasing news for the many friends
of Mr. Folsom in this city and county.
Of Mr. Folsom it may be honestly said
that he is a self-made man. Coming to
Yuba County with his parents when yet
a child, he was raised on a farm ten
miles east of this city, attending a coun
try school and working on the ranch until
18Â»vears old. Although handicapped In tho
battle of life by having but one arrn^he
drove a team, guided tho plow and nar
pow and hauU-d hay and in many other
ways astonished the neighbors by his will
ingness and ability to perform manual
labor.
With tho few dollars that he earned in
this way ho came to Marysvlllc and rent
ed humble lodgings, where he maintained
himself and attended the High School un
der the late Professor E. K. Hill. Then
when the latter opened the Knnxdale In
stitute at Brownsville, this county, young
Folsom was one of the first scholars. He
graduated at tho head of his class and
had no trouble in securing a position as
teacher in a neighboring school. Â¦ In a
short time his ability was recognized and
he was appointed a teacher in the Marys
vllle schools at a good salary.
While thus employed he spent his even
ings in the study of law. having as co
workers K. P. MoDanielP, the present Dis
trict Attorney of Yuba County, H. Juch
and others. In a brief space of time he
qualified himself for the Supreme Court
examination and had no trouble in the se
curing of the sheepskin. Just prior to his
admission to the bar. he was elected to
the position of Superintendent of Schools
of this county and he served as such of
ficer four years, from January 1, 1890, to
January 1. 1595. In the latter year he en
gaged in the practice of law In Marysville
in copartnership with E. P. McDaniel and

BOER ACCOUNT OF
DEWETSDORP FIGHT
DEWETSDORP. Orange Free State,
Saturday. April 21.â When General De
wet's scouts announced on Thursday
evening that General Kelly-Kenny's and
General Rundle's column, was advancing
on Dewetsdorp he ordered "up saddle"
and moved with the Ficksburg command
and Generals Cronje, Olivier and Wessels
to intercept their march. This was suc
ceFsful on Friday morning. The British
occupied the grassy hill at Taljard'p farm
and Dewet. those immediately southwest
of Dewetsdorp facing the British. Cronje
delayed occupying an important bill,
which the British took at noon.
At 9 yesterday rifle firing commenced
briskly. The British had trenches and had
thrown up schanzes. At 11 o'clock the
Free State cannon and Maxim guns
opened fire and the former constantly
dropped shells into the British camp.
Darkness .stopped the fighting until \l,
when the Bethlehem men on the extreme
right heard some British in their imme
diate vicinity and opened fire. Their com
mandant stepped out into the darkness*
and discovered a wounded man and fif
teen British, who declared they had lost
their way while searching for water. At
daybreak thirteen more British strayed
into camp. â¢>*Â¦â¢â¢!â¢
In the morning the British started an
outflanking movement, sending a large
body of horse to the hills southwest off
Dewetsdorp. General Dewet immediately
dispatched General Wessels with three
cannon to head off , the British, and the
latter, having no cannon, were forced to
return to camp. At the main positions a
constant cannonade was maintained, but
there was little rifle fire.
The British camp. was observed at sun
set to be hastily packing up and was sub
sequently removed' behind the hills, the
troops in the schanzes firing volley after
ROBERTS FAILS
TO TRAP BOERS
Continued from First Page,
SANTA ROSA, April 25,â This evening
shortly before 7 o'clock Dr. H. S. Bogle,
one of the most prominent physicians in
this city, as a result of what is claimed
to have been a difficulty over money mat
ters, shot and in all probability fatally
wounded J. M. Miller, a' paint and oil
dealer, whos? place of business is located
on Hinton avenue, near the City Hall.
Bogle and Miller occupy adjoining
houses on Johnson street, a few doors
from the First Presbyterian Church. Mil
ler's house is located on the corner and
faces on Mendocino street; Bogle's resi
dence adjoins it on the rear, but /aces on
Johnson street. The two yards are sep
arated by a low fence. Miller's side gate
Is enly a few feet from Dr. Bogle's front
gate, and it was at this spot that the
shooting occurred.
.Dr. Bogle had just finished his supper
and started downtown. As hr> came out
of his front gate Miller, who was standing
near his side gate and inside his yard, ac
costed the physician and according to his
own admission applied an insulting epithet
as he did so. He either had a knife in his
hand as he did so or drew one immedi
ately afterward, for a moment later he
stepped toward the fence separating him
from the physician and apparently pre
pared to strike, when the doctor quietly
drew his revolver and fired three Bhqts,
two of them taking effect.
The 'first struck Miller in the forearm.

upper part of the groin, being found later
In his clothing. Neighbors were attracted
to the spot by the shooting, among them
being James W. Gates, John T. Campbell
and J. L. Duravage. who assisted Miller
into the house and summoned Dr. J. W.
Jesse, who gave the injured man all the
attention in his power.
Dr. Bogle at once walked to the Sheriff s
office and gave himself up. Later he wan
taken before Judge Brown and admitted

passed. He says:
"General Pole-Carew found it neces
sary to use shell on the left flank. The
Boers evidently intended to draw him Into
action in order to delay the column, but
the admirable tactics adopted enabled a
steady advance, only interrupted by slight
delays. The Boers always took good care
to keep their baggage and guns well out
of range. In the afternoon the Boers
evacuated their positions.
"General French's advance cut their
communication north of the town. The
action "was fought at Rool Kop. The
Boers retired to the northeast. They

AMERICAN COLLEGE
YELL FOR KRUGER
LONDON, April 2G.â The Daily .Mail has
the following from Lourenzo Marques,
dated Wednesday, April 25:
"A daring attempt to destroy the bridge
at Komatlpoort Sunday night was frus
trated by Kaffirs, who gave the alarm
and frightened oft the Boers. The Boers
have lined all the hills in the vicinity
with riflemen, fearing an attack by Brit
ish troops advancing by some mysterious
route.
"The Irish-American brigade, chiefly so
called 'ambulance men,* left Pretoria

being addressed by President Krugcr, to
whom the men responded with an Amer

B. Lemon went security for his appear
ance and he was released. The date of
the examination has not yet been set, but
probably will be to-morrow.
George Felix, an employe of the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway, who was
passing down Mendocino street at the
time on his wheel, was an eyewitness to
the shooting. Attracted by the first shot
he dashed down Johnson street just in
time to see the last two shots fired. The
two men were at that time about fifteen
feet apart and Miller was staggering to
ward the house.
Dr. Bogle came here about two years
ago from Monterey, where he enjoyed a
large and highly remunerative practice.
He has many friends, all of whom, while
deeply regretting to-night's occurrence,
express themselves strongly as of the
opinion that the shooting was justifiable.
He certainly has never shown himself
during his residence here in any- but a
highly favorable light.
Miller ha.-* resided here some ten or
eleven years. For a time he was exten
sively engaged in the carpet business.
Later he sold out and for about two years
conducted a livery stable. About a year
ago he purchased the paint and oil store
of J. E. Gannon on Hinton avenue, which
he has since conducted. The two men
met downtown yesterday not far from
Miller's place of business and exchanged
hot words, and to-night Is the first time
they had met since. The affair has cre
ated a great deal of comment here. At a
late hour to-night Miller's condition was
reported as being serious.

A. L. McCandless. of Santa Lucia No. 9..
submitted a resolution to the Grand I ar
lor to-day providing that the custom be
not re-established. The resolution was
filed for future action after some debate,
the discussion showing a sentiment
against any such legislation. Oroville has
a candidate for grand trustee in A. \V.
Smith. He has been making no fight for
the place, and all along it has been con
ceded that one of the offices should be
his. The Zabala resolution, however, may
put a different aspect to his chances.
'The place of next meeting has finally
come up on a telegram from vallejo in
which that town offers hospitality for
1901. The offer will be acted upon to-mor
row. Santa Barbara is understood to bÂ«
after the session now. but Y^'lfJo will
probably get it. There is no bidding for
the session this year, and it has been a
matter of surprise to the delegates that
the question has been so little in evidence
this year.

providing for the "appointment of a com

rushed around to the old Inhabitants col
lecting opinions on the weather prospects.
That the rain had come was every one's
thought, but the town rose to the occasion
once more and by noon the same old sun
was out. It was not perfectly clear to
night, but there seems no further danger
of a sprinkle.
The great event of the dayâ one excitinc:
oven more interest than the telegram from

odorous from beginning to end," said he,
"that it should die the death of a dog."
"Smoke the rascals out." cried Little,
"and we on this side of the House will
stay with you."
Moody said it was not a pleasant thing
for him to exploit the scandal which had
been uncovered by the Postal Commission,
cf which he was a member, but he consid
ered it his duty to do so. He declared
that former Second Assistant Postmaster
General Nlelson, under whom the first ex
periments in the pneumatic-tube service
were made, when he retired accepted
from the company $1000 in cash and $10,0)0
in stock for his services here during the
succeeding year. What that service could
be. Moody said, he could not Imagine.
These facts, he said, had been brought
out by the commission. John E. Milhol
land of New York, he said, was the presi
dent of the tube company.
Moody's next statement startled tho
House and created a sensation. Tlie tube
service, he said, had been constructed by
contractors, who took their pay in stock
and bonds. The only asset was its con
tract with the Government.
"I regret to say." continued Moody, de
liberately, "that one of the principal hold
ers of these stocks and bonds was a mem
ber of this House and a member of the
Committee on Appropriations."
"Give his name, shouted Livingston of
Georgia.
"I will not." replied Moody.
Then he added another sensational
statement to the effect that a large block
of the stock had been sent to a near rela
tive of a prominent member of the House
as a New Year's gift. "But I am proud
to cay." said Moody, "that the return
mail carried back that dishonoring and
dishonorable gift."
When the applause that greeted this
statement had died out Moody appealed
to the House not to indorse "this sort of
transaction."

Columbus Convention
Adopts a Platform
as Dictated by the
President
pyOLUMBUS. Ohio. April 23.â The Re-
I publican State Convention here to-
I day was of national significance.
I . The delegates and alternates at
large represent close personal as
well as political friends of the President,
and the platform is just as it came from
Washington, with the addition of the
anti-trust resoiution and the omission of
the Porto Rican resolution.
The so-called "Hanna" slata on dele
gates and alternates at large and the
State ticket went through without any
trouble.
There was. however, opposition to Food
Commissioner Blackburn because he was
running for a third term and for other
locx.l reasons, and to General Grosvenor
for delegate from the friends of ex-Gov
erncr Bushneil. The opposition, how
ever, was unsuccessful. * Attention was
called to the fact that General Grosvenor
wks a delegate at large four years ago
and that he had been a district delegate
to national conventions ever since the Re
publican party had existed. At this con
vention. Jt was charged, he was mere
than the chairman 01 the committee on
resolutions, that he had brought the plat
form with him and had successfully re
sisted any material revisions. The efforts
cf the Bushneil men to substitute some
one in place of Urosvenor made an un
usually interesting acene, which reached
Sis climax when J. Frank McGrew, ex-
Kepresentative-and son-in-law of former
Governor Uusnr.cil. was Epeaking on his
amendment to strike out Grosvenor and
insert Hanna. McGrew eulogized Hanna,
whom he has heretofore opposed, and said
tne Democrats would make capital out of
the action of the Republicans of the Pres
ident's State if Senator Hanna were not
made one of the "big four."
Hanna Defies Democratic Opinion.
When Senator Hanna was finally called
to the front of the platform the speech of
the ex-Representative caused the Senator
to proclaim emphatically:
"What do I caxe what the Democrats
say about me?v
In declining to be a delegate. Senator
Hanna delivered a philippic against what
he termed â¢"expediencies."
When Senator Hanna said he would not
serve as a delegate there was a motion to
strike out Grosvenor and insert ex-Gover
nor Foster. Foster stepped to the front
of the platform and declined because he
"would not want to 'break the excellent
Elate that has been brought to Ohio from
Washington."
The resolution making Foraker, Nash.
Grosvenor and Dick the delegates at large
was offered by ex-Senator Massie of Gros
venor's Congressional district, and the
Busnnell men charged that it was the
Grosvenor plan to avoid balloting. As
soon as this resolution was adopted Gen
eral Grosvtnor offered a resolution Just
like it by which the four alternates at
large were also selected in a bunch with
out any of the forms of presenting names
or balloting.
The committee on credentials found the
only contest in Washington County, and
reported in favor of seating both delega
tions, with each member having one-half
vote. Ex-Representative Taylor, who led
the opposition, insisted that this report
would be like Congress allowing Roberts
of Utah one-fourth vote and his three
wives each one-fourth vote. Taylor's mo
tion to seat the delegates selected under
the call of the State Committee and to
unseat the contestants carried â ayes 455,
noes 25?.

MURDERED BY
WILD CHINESE
ON THE BORDER
How Dr. Kiddle and Suther
land Met Their
Death.
VANCOUVER. B. C. April 23.â The de
tails of the Kiddle-Sutherland murders
were received from Burmah to-day by the
steamer Empress of China, twelve days
from Yokohama. The aggressors in this
outrage were the Was or "wild" Was, as
they are commonly called, living In Meng
kaus. - A party, including Dr. Kiddle,
Sutherland and J. H. Lytton, with an es
cort in charge of a Chinese non-commls-
Eioned officer, were suddenly attacked
from ambush by the Was, who were arm
ed with crossbows, stones and arrows.
During the retreat. Dr. Kiddle and Suth
erland were wounded by crossbows and
while lying on the ground were stoned to
death by the Was. Lytton was rendered
temporarily Insensible by a stone, but,
recovering, he seized a gun and shot a
Was, who was going to finish him with
a spear. Four of the Chinese escort were
killed. The Chinese sergeant, although
severely wounded, behaved with gallantry.
Three days after this outrage, the
united British and Chinese forces attacked
the Was and a sharp encounter took
place, the entire spur of the Was stock
ades being cleared. The group of Was
vHlages implicated in the original attack
were then made objects of attack by the
British-Chinese force and as a result 2000
houses were burned and sixty Was were
killed. In this second fight four Chinese
were killed and twenty wounded, while of
the British force one Ghurka was killed
and five wounded.
The Tsung Li Yamen has received a
telegram from Chinese officials in Yunnan
to the effect that British troops, rein
forced by 200 men from Burmah. destroyed
and burned the Chinese fortresses at Te
Tso and Pa Nih. on the Burmah-Yunnan
frontier, killing eight Chinese soldiers.
This was in reprisal for an attack upon
the British commission. The Yamen was
terrified by this intelligence and Immedi
ately sent a humble message to the Brit
ish Minister. Sir Claude Mac Donald, beg
ging him to prevent any further drastic
measures by the British troops on the
frontier, promising to make every effort
to give full redress by China for the out
rage if the British solfliers were re
strained. They begged the Minister to
use his Influence to obtain a peaceful set
tlement and a calm Investigation into the
outrage. Mac Donald declined to Influence
British action in Yunnan.

SIBERIAN WHEAT IS OF
INFERIOR QUALITY
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 25.^Tapa
nese papers publish Interviews with Wil
liam Bunker, representative of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce in
Japan. Mr. Bunker is of the opinion that
there is no ground for fearing that Siberia
will become a serious competitor of the
United States in wheat raising. He says
wheat grown In Eastern Siberia Is inferior
to the American product, and even when,
produced from California seed It deterior
ates. Another feature noted by Mr.
Bunker while In Russia was the presence
of quantities of American flour at every
landing place along the Amur.
Concerning lumber, Mr. Bunker says
that despite the abundance of forests
from Vladivostok to the Urals, the trees
are small, the greater part of the lumber
used coming from Puget Sound districts.
Thus far the Trans-Siberian Railway has
benefited commercial Interests In tho

OHIO REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
COLUMBUS, April 25.â The platform adopted by the Repnblican State Con
vention reaffirms the declaration of principles made by the Republican party
In St. Louis in 1596, and continues:
We cordially indorse the wise and patriotic administration of President McKln
ley. These signal achievements In war and peace. In statesmanship and diplomacy,
mark an epoch in the history of the nation, and whese brilliant success justifies and
demands, in the highest Interests of the country, the uninterrupted continuance
thTwgh another term of his great but uncompleted work. Confronting unprecedented
requirements at home and unexampled responsibilities abroad, he has met them with
a courage, fidelity and strength which have given Mm an enduring place la thÂ« con
fidence and affection of his countrymen.
Every pledge of his administration has been faithfully redeemed. It has dispelled
long business depression, restored the protection of American labor and industry, re
wakened universal confidence, re-established a prosperity unparalleled, assured to labor
tho steadiest employment and the highest pay. opened cow fields of enterprise and
new markets far trade. It has brought to agriculture a better condition than for many
years, fixed the gold standard upon firm foundations of law and made our national
currency larger In volume and sure In value and lifted our national credit to the
highest plane any nation has ever reached.
In the broader field of world duty and influence It has met an unavoidable war for
humanity with unecualed vigor and success: has crowned the matchless triumph of
our arms en sea and land with the courageous acceptance of Its h.'rh and solemn ob
ligation; has faithfully studied and sought equally the true honor of the nation and
the greatest good of the peoples who have come under our flag, and has, through the wise
use of expanded* opportunity, led our country on pathways of greatness and renown.
We reaffirm the principle In which the Republican party has Us birth, and of which
Abraham Lincoln was elected President, that the representatives of the people have
full power over territory belonging to the United States, In harmony with and sub
ject to the fundamental safeguards of our free Institutions for liberty. Justice and
personal rights. We sustain the President and Congress In exercising this power with
due rerard for the safety and welfare of the Union, and with the most Just, gener
ous, humane and fraternal consideration for those over whom the authority of the na
tion Is extended. We advocate for them free schools, full security of life, liberty and
prosperity, the meet liberal measures for the development of their agriculture and
Industry. Â»nd the largest degree of local self-rule fcr which they are fitted. We have faith
In American patriotism, character and capacity, and we know that American gov
ernment will extend the Inestimable blessings of freedom, law and civilization to
the peoples who are brought under our protection.
The provisions of the treaty of Paris are approved In every particular.
On this subject the platform continues:
That sovereignty (the Philippines) must not be repudiated and the hl^h motive of
its orictn must result In the establishment of peace and order and the blessings of
Individual liberty among the peoples of the Phllij>:>lnÂ« Islands.
The platform favors such legislation by Congress as will encourage- and
promote a United States merchant marine. The plank on trusts is as follows:
The Republican party of Ohio stands committed to legislative and executive oppo
sition to threatening combinations of capital that Â«eelc to restrict competition and
etlfle lndet>endent Investments that are material to the Industrial development or the
State and the lareest emDlorment of labor, but we insist that Injurious combina
tions shall be forbidden and so-called trusts shall be so regulated from time to time
and be so restricted to guarantee Immunity from hurtful monopoly and assure fair
treatment and protection to all competing Industries.
The platform strongly indorses the administration of Governor Nash and
declares for a uniform system of municipal government.

the Senate to tho effect that the result of
Senator Hanna's attitude in the contest
which ended yesterday and which caused
the defeat of Quay will be that every
measure in which the chairman of the
Republican National Committee Is inter
ested will be defeated unless the Demo
crats break party lines. So bitter are
Quay Republicans at Senator Hanna that
they openly announce that they will de
feat the subsidy bill for no other reason
than that he is interested 1n its success.
"Xot only will the subsidy bill fail this
session, but it will be defeated whenever
it is brought up," said a leading Repub
lican Senator to a number of newspaper
correspondents this afternoon. "Hanna
will learn that it is more blessed to give
than to receive. Heretofore he has been
receiver general of the party. It would
be folly for us to say that the defeat of
Quay will endanger the party in Pennsyl
vania, but you may be sure that other
means of retaliatioa will be taken. Han
na is a nice man to ascend to moral ele
vation, there to announce that he cannot
vote against his principles. Why, look at
his own admission to the Senate. He
came to Washington under charges of
greater seriousness than were ever pre
ferred against Quay. He moved all of the
partisan machinery under his control to
save himself from an investigation, and
the best that he could get was a party
vote. The party saved him and this is his
gratitude. Well, he will find that more
than one can play at that game. He
will be zero in the Senate from this time
so far as his ability to influence legislation
and if he ever makes another misstep he
will fall harder than Quay has fallen."
Quay In an interview says he will bo
re-elected by the next Legislature.

SENATE AGREES
TO REPORT ON
HAWAIIAN BILL
Agricultural Appropriation
of Three Million Dollars
Passed.
Consideration of the Alaskan Civil
Code Measure Is Resumed,
but No Progress Is
Made.
'- Â¦ Â»
WASHINGTON. April 25.â After a brief
debate to-day the Senate agreed to the
conference report of the Hawaiian civil
government bill, the provisions relating
to the right of franchise and imprison
ment for debt having been amended ti>
conform to the ideas of the Senate. The
figricultural appropriation bill was passed,
carrying a little over $3,000,000. The Alas
kan civil government bill was under con
sideration for an hour, but no progress
was made.
Cullom presented the conference report
on the bill to provide a government for
Hawaii, explaining that the principal
changes made by the last Congress wad
the striking out of all provisions requir
ing the payment of taxes before registra
tion to vote and the elimination of the
provision that a person may be im
prisoned for debt or for nonpayment of.
taxes.
Tillman inquired what had been done
with the provision requiring the Presi
dent to appoint the officials of the ter
ritory from among the residents of Ha
waii. Cullom replied that the ofllces were
to be filled by citizens of Hawaii. Till
man thought this provision ought to have
been inserted in the Porto Rican bill that
"carpet-baggers" should not be "inflicted
upon those people." Foraker pointed ou;
that under the Porto Rican bill the Presi
dent, if he saw fit, could appoint all the
officers of Porto Rico from citizens of tho
island. Platt of Connecticut protested
against requiring the President to ap
point officials of the islands from their
inhabitants. The conference report was
agreed to without division.
Consideration of the agricultural ap
propriation bill was then begun. As re
ported to the Senate it carried $3,959,120.
The committee amendment reducing the
amount fixed by tho House for the pur
chase and distribution of seeds from
$170,000 to $130,000 was abandoned, Tillman,
Kenny, Berry, Stewart and Butler op
posing the amendment.
Consideration of the Alaskan civil code
bill was resumed, the pending question be
ing the amendment relating to the Cape
Nome mining claims, offered by Hans
brough, who said that, having been con
vinced his amendment was too radical,
he had decided to withdraw it. He then
accepted the substitute offered by Carter
with the insertion of a provision that it
should apply to the District of Alaska and
not to the entire public domain.
Coal Miners Strike.
LA BALLE, 111.. April 25.-U 1> an

HILO, Hawaii, April 12.â Augustus
Schwartz of San Francisco was slashed
with a knife and killed by Arthur Mynus,
an employe of the Volcano Transporta
tion Company of Hilo, in a livery stable
at this place during a quarrel over a triv
ial matter 1 . The dead man had been in the
Islands about two years, working as a
carriage trimmer. His widowed mother
lives at 1625 Buchanan street, San Fran
cisco, with a married daughter Mrs. Val
entine. Valentine conducts a tailoring
establishment on Bush street, San Fran
cisco.
Schwartz was well liked by everybody,
being of a lively disposition and Intellect
ually bright. He was a member of the
Knights of Pythias. The local lodge con
ducted the funeral, which was a very
beautiful and impressive ceremony. Re
ligious service's were held at the foreign
church. The Episcopal burial service was
read byithe Rev. J. A. Cruzan, after which
the march to the cemetery was taken.
The procession was headed by the Hilo
band, of which deceased had been a mem
ber. The remains were followed by a
large concourse of the representative peo
ple of Hilo, including Americans. English.
Portuguese. Hawallans, Japanese and
Chinese, the tears of all telling more elo
quently than words the respect for the
unfortunate dead man.
The slayer of Schwartz is about 22 years
old, very boytsh-looking, pale-faced, of
etlight stature and inclined to be wild.
In company with several other younp
men he had put in the day drinking and
riding in a hack, and to the fact that he
was intoxicated may be laid the killing.
The wound that caused death was in
liicted on the right side of the neck, ex
tending tw>i Inches on a parallel with the
jaw. and was made with a common
pocket knife, which severed ttie carotid
artery, jugular vein, the larpe muscles of
neck, and three-fourths of the windpipe.
The stricken man collapsed instantly and
saying. "God help me." died.
Upon the collapse of his victim the slay
er threw away his knife find ran to the
police station, saying: to the lieutenant of
police whom he met there he "had a light
with Schwartz and fixed him." Lieuten
ant Eaton placed him under arrest.
The Coroner's jury upon the evidence
piven at the Inquest returned a verdict
that Schwartz came to his death from a
wound made hy a knife In the hands of
Arthur Mynus.

It cannot beÂ«tin to equal the amount sDent by

AS. HALLIDIE died at his resi
dence. 1032 Washington street,
. Tuesday night of heart disease,
Â» from which he had suffered for
several years. He was 64 years of age.
Andrew Smith Hallidie was one of San
Francisco's most famous citizens, his
greatest achievement being the invention
of the cable-car system, which solved the
street passenger problem in this city and
gave the world a new mode of urban
transit.
Mr. Hallidie was born in London March
1(5. 1536. He was the son of Andrew Smith
of Dumfrieuhire. Scotland, but adopted
the name of his godfather and uncle, Sir
Andrew Hallidie. a Scotch physician. His
father was an inventor, his most import
ant work being the making of cables from
iron and steel. This invention made the
cable railway possible.
In 1552 Mr. Hallidle came to California
with his father and followed mining for
three years, studying and practicing en
gineering in the meantime. He surveyed
ditches and roads and built bridges. When
but 19 years of age he built a wire sus
pension aqueduct with a 220-foot span
across the middle fork of the American
River. In IST6 he produced the first cable
made on the Pacific Slope. He established
a wire rope factory in San Francisco the
following year.
In ISC7 he invented a means of carrying
freight â¢ across mountain canyons by
means of a continuous overhead cable,
known as "Hallidie's ropeway." This
was followed by the invention of the cable
railway.
This most important of his public
achievements was matured in 1871 and
was put into actual practice in 1873. His
scheme was looked upon by many as vis
ionary, but Joseph Britton, Henry L.
Davis and James Mofflt each advanced
Orders Were Issued to Exterminate.

MRS. JANE GIFT OF ntBBARDSVILLE. OHIO.
Mrs. Jane Gift of Hebbardsville, Ohio, writes the following:
"/ think I would have been dead long ago if it had not been for Peruna. Six years
ago I had la grippe very bad. The doctor came to see me every day. but I gradually
grew worse. I told my husband I thought I would surely die if I did not get relief soon.
"One day I picked up the newspaper and accidentally found a testimonial of a woman
who had been cured of grip by Peruna. I told my husband I wanted to try it. He went
directly to the drug store and got a bottle of Peruna. I could see the improvement in a
very short time and was scon able to do my work. I continued using it until I was
entirely cured."
Catarrh has been so generally thought
to be a disease confined to the head and
throat that it is very difficult to gel
many people to understand that catarrh
may affect any part of the human body, j
All the organs of the body are lined with I
mucous membrane; all the passages of i
the body are also lined with mucous I
membrane. Wherever there is a mucous
membrane there catarrh may exist.
Peruna is not a cure-all. It cures cn-
tarrh. mis is all that is claimed for it.

$22,000 to help carry it out. Mr. Hallidie
put in an equal amount and Clay-street
property owners pledged $10,000 conditional
upon the road being a success. How
great a success it was the world knows
and San Francisco, built upon hills as it
is, owes much of its advancement to the
cable railways.
At the time of his death Mr. Hallidie
was a member of the American Society of
Inventors. American Geographical So
ciety of New York, California Academy of
Sciences, and of many other similar in
stitutions. He was president of the Me
chanics' Institute, ISCB-78 and 1593-9G and
at one time vice president of the James
Lick School of Mechanical Arts. He was
a member of both Boards of Freeholders
appointed to frame a new charter and
was for many years a trustee of the Free
Public Library.
Mr. Hallidie had been a Regent of the
State University since its foundation in
186 S. and was for the last fifteen years
chairman of the board's finance com
mittee.
In 1884 Mr. Hallidie was delegated by
the commercial associations of California
to present a congratulatory address to
President Diaz and he journeyed to Mex
ico for that purpose.
Mr. Hallidie was a member of the Pa
cific Union and Sierra clubs, but belonged
to no secret order. He always took an
active part In independent politics but
never held a salaried ofllce. He occa
sionally contributed articles to magazines
and newspapers.
Mr. Hallidie was married In November
1863. to Miss Martha Elisabeth Woods of
Sacramento. She survives him. He had
one daughter, who is Mrs. McMicken of
Seattle.
Mr. Hallidle took much interest in the
affairs of the Unitarian church. The
funeral will take place Friday or Satur
day and Rev.- Horatio Stebbins will offi
ciate.

5The social and domestic demands
that are made upon the women of to-day
are to blame for a great deal of the
trouble called female weakness. The
constant strain upon the nerve forces
weakens the vital powers, and head-
aches, neuralgia, indigestion, constipa-
tion, impure blood and liver and kid-
ney troubles all aggravate the special
weakness that fills thousands of homes
with delicate mothers, wives and daugh-
ters. Weak and nervous women can be
relieved and made well and strong, full
of vital energy and attractive sweetness,
if they will take Dr. Miles' Nervine.
'"For fourteen years I was troubled
with female weakness and nervous-
ness, dizzy and sinking spells, and was
confined to my bed more than one-half
the time. The doctors all told me that
I could not live long; but the second
day after I began taking Dr. Miles'
Nervine I could eat well and could sleep
all night without waking, and when I
had used six bottles I was cured.

NATURALIZATIONâ N. N., City.
strumentahty engaged in interstate commerce. It ap
pears that the war revenue act requires it to issue bills
of lading to which a one-cent stamp has been affixed,
duly canceled, but allows it to make a contract \vith
the shipper whereby the latter shallpay for the stamp.
Suppose California shippers decline to pay for the
stamps, but insist upon their packages being carried
and the issuance to them of legalâ that is to say,
stampedâ bills of lading? The question is, can the
express company violate the State law and refuse to
convey the packages? We think not. It certainly
cannot do so without rendering itself liable for dam
ages, and in no event without jeopardizing its fran
chise. The sections of the Civil Code quoted above
do not conflict with the war revenue act; on the con
trary, they supplement and clarify it. It follows,
therefore, that the shippers of California still possess
the poiver, notwithstanding the ruling of Justice
White in the case under consideration, to compel
Wells, Fargo & Co. to pay its war taxes. Our Su
preme Court can hardly fail to so decide in the case
before itâ provided the record has been properly
made up.
* City Attorney Frank K. Lane is emphatically of
the opinion that no person or corporation shall be ai
lowed to place obstructions on public sidewalks or
streets. The City Attorney 'is significantly silent in
reference to that public thoroughfare known as Sulli
van alley, which has been open for many years, but
which has now been seized as private property. Con
ditions sometimes make fine distinctions in the law.
A DEMAND FOR IMPROVEMENTS
AMONG the improvement clubs which of late^
have been so instrumental in advancing thÂ«; j
welfare of the city and promoting a spirit of
enterprise and progress among the people none has
been more earnest nor more efficient than those rep
resenting the Mission, for the clubs of that section
have united themselves as a federation and are thus
able to work more successfully than they could have
done otherwise.
At a recent meeting the federation adopted resolu
tions declaring the immigration of Japanese to be a
menace to the welfare of our producing classes and I
urging our Senators and Representatives in Congress
to immediately take steps to procure the passage of
an act excluding Japanese and all Asiatic people from
our shores. In addition to those resolutions on au
issue affecting the country at large the federation
adopted others relating to municipal affairs, an-1
making a strong presentation of the importance of a
larger provision in the appropriations of the coming
year for city improvements.
The latter resolution merits reproduction in full.
It declares: "That this federation urge the Mer
chants' Association to co-operate with these improve
ment clubs to induce the Board of Supervisors to
increase the appropriation for general improvements
to at least $500,000. We believe that this amount can
be obtained by curtailing the proposed expenditures
of- several of the municipal departments. We further
believe that the Auditor has been too liberal to the '
taxeaters and has shown too little regard for the tax
payers and the needs and welfare of the city, es
pecially as to improvements."
The resolution is based upon objections made to
certain features of the estimates recently submitted
by Auditor Wells, it b<*.ng the opinion of the federa- I
tion that the appropriations proposed for Health and
Police departments and the Board of Works, for
salaries, operating expenses, etc., are too large.
There will of course be differences of opinion on
details of that kind, but it is gratifying to have an
earnest and representative body of taxpayers and
citizens generally taking a public-spirited interest in
municipal affairs and giving a large portion of their
time and their thoughts to considerations .of muni
cipal issues. The larger part of the bad or wasteful
features of administration in American cities is due
to the indifference of the citizens to public business.
When "people neglect to look after their interests it
is inevitable that losses will result. Our improve
ment clubs have done much to improve in many ways
the localities in which they operate, but their chief I
value has been that of awakening the people to an
intelligent study of municipal administration. The
tax levy and the appropriations for the coming year
are matters of grave importance to all, and the Mis
sion Federation has done well in beginning at once to
bring them up for general discussion.
The farmers of the Mississippi River States are
forming a gigantic trust that in the character of its
very organization dooms it to failure. All politics is
barred in it.
RAILWAY POSTAL RATES.
WHEN the postoflice appropriation bill was be
fore the House on Monday there followed the
usual discussion upon the proper method of
limiting the expenses of the department and making
; it self-sustaining. One member proposed that 'the
pneumatic service should be cut off, and another ad
vised that no further extensions be made in the way of
rural mail deliveries. Several other suggestions of , that
form of economy were advanced, and then Congress
man Bell of Colorado directed attention once more
to the exorbitant rates paid to the railways for carry
ing the mails and counseled the practice of economy
by reducing the payments to the roads.
Mr. Bell is right. The causes of the annual de
ficiency in the Postoflice Department are two. In the
first place the abuse of the second class mail privilege j
is carried to such an extent that the Government
loses annually a large sum of money in carrying mat
ter which ought to be charged full rates; and in the
second place the amounts paid to the railroads are far
in excess of what the service is worth.
As was pointed out in the debate, the charge of the
railways for carrying mails averages eight cents a
pound, while the railway charge for express pack
ages is less than one cent per pound. "Why," asked
Mr. Bell, "should the Government pay more?"
The rates now paid by the Government for carry
ing mail are the same as those paid in 1878, notwith
standing that since that time the average freight rates
have declined 35 per cent and passenger rates 17^3
per cent. That showing is in itself sufficient to prove
that the railways are demanding and receiving excei
sive charges from the Government. Sovlong as such
waste is permitted so long will the people have to
lack for services which the Postofficc Department
should give.
There ought to be a pneumatic tube service in all
large cities and a free delivery system in all thickly
settled country districts. There should be. also a
cheap" parcels post and a system of postal savings
brinks. Those services arc rendered by the postoffices
of countries whose people are by no means so ener
getic, so enterprising. Or so progressive as our own,
and it is absurd that we should lack them. So long,
however, as the railroads are permitted to exact from
the Government outrageous charges -for .services, so
long must we lag behind other nations in postofficc
development.
THE evil of racetrack gambling which has extended Its cancerous roots Into

authorities as menacing many important branches of the Government by
the corruption of Government employes. So marked has been the work of
the racetrack vice In this city that Postmaster Montague has been Impelled by
his sense of duty to the people and by the responsibility that he assumed when
he took the oath of office to notify all persons employed in the San Francisco
Postofflce that they must hold themselves aloof from the maelstrom of turf
gambling under penalty of discharge.
His language is unmistakable, and the following circular which he Issued to
the employes of the San Francisco Postofflce last Tuesday needs no explanation:
four and eight realea are not premium
coins, even though dating back 20n years.
A three-cent piece, silver, of ;sÂ£s com
mands a premium of from 17 to 37 cents; a
copper-nickel cent of 1553 doe^ not com
mand a premium^

of from $7 s<> to J? 50, but dealers do not

HALEâ Oaklander, Cal. Hale Is a verb
which was in common use until the eight
eenth century, but after that haul took it*
place. Hale 13 used to express; to go or
come by means of drawing, pushing or
pressing; to push a person, to move or
proceed. Lately ia has ccme Into use
again.
MALE AND FEMALEâ N. J., City,
Prior to the adoption of the present con
stitution of California there wa3 an or
dinance of the Board of Supervisors o'
San Francisco which prohibited female?
from being In liquor salocr.s. and under
that ordinance it was held that no woman
could engage In the liquor business and
attend to It In person. Th!s was abro
gated by the new constitution, which
says: "No person shall, on account of sex,
be disqualified from entering upon or pur
suing any lawful business, vocation or
profession." "While the law cannot pre
vent a woman from engaging in the retail
liquor business and tending to It In per
son, women can be prohibited from visit
ing liquor saloons as patror.s.
JAPAN AROUSED.
\ 7 HEX The Call sounded the tocsin to warn this
\\! country of the coming invasion by Japanese
* coolies we declared the time to be favorable
j for reformation of our treaties with that empire, in
! order to enable the exclusion of this undesirable class
i of its subjects.
The latest news from Tokio confirms the correct
ness of this forecast. It appears that there are two
Japanese immigration societies, which are in hot
rivalry in the exportation of their countrymen. The
j Government has concluded that the operations of
j these societies are not ujiright and honorable toward
j the men they export. They proceed by spreading
j through the country glowing accounts of the easy
I work and high wages they will guarantee to their
patrons, and when they have secured them and the
commission they pay for the Utopian privileges prom
ised the interest of the immigration agency ceases.
The coolies are shipped in the steerage and landed in
this country to shift for themselves. They are mostly
without guidance and wholly without control, and
their American experience is often as unpleasant to
them as their presence is undesirable to us.
The Japanese Government proposes to interfere for
the purpose of protecting its people from the imposi
tions of these immigration agencies. Under its sys-,
tern of paternalism that Government has the power to
forbid emigration entirely. If it do this of course the
occupation of the agencies will be gone, and such
solution of the difficulty would be very agreeable to
Americans.
The Japanese Government is proud of the as
sumed superiority of its people over the Chinese, and,
it is said, will resent a Japanese exclusion act which
seems to treat the Japanese and Chinese in the came
manner.
Our^ Government would hesitate to provoke that
resentment because of its effect upon our rapidly
growing trade with Japan. But it must not be for
gotten that our trade with Japan is more important
to her than to us. We import much more from that
country- than we export to it. In 1898 we exported
to Japan $20,502,156 in merchandise, and imported
from Japan $25,224,102. As far as trade goes she
has more to lose from any interruption than we have.
Put no interruption is necessary. The ?\[ikadj j
doesn't want his subjects scattered to the four winds.
He does not want to have to tom-tom them from
the ends of the earth when their presence is necessary
in his army and navy to maintain the position he has
assumed in oriental politics.
It will no doubt be found sufficient to intimate
diplomatically that our Government agrees with the
Mikado, that it is better for his people to btay at
home, and their migration will cease.
If, However, it prove that this course is ineffective,
we do not hesitate to say that Congress should act
independently of the wish of Japan and exclude the
coolies. The Japanese Government has the interests
of its own people to consider. Ours has the interests
of our people, and should not hesitate to even affront
Japan, if that be the spirit in which she takes the dis
charge of our duty to ourselves.
Since the Supervisors have discovered that there
is already a local law commanding a tax upon tele- 1
phone nickel-in-the-slot machines, it will be interest- I
ing to watch for the next artifice of the monopoly to j
svoid payment. If the telephone monopoly possesses I
any conscientious scruples they are concerned solely
with a purpose of cheating the Tax Collector.
THE WAR STAMP TAX CASE.
THE decision of the United States Suprcir.*
Court in the case of the American Express
Company vs. Maynard. Attorney General of
Michigan, the text of which is now before us, does
not, as The Call anticipated, settle the war revenue
tax controversy with Wells. Fargo & Co.'s Express
Company in this State. Justice White, who wrote
the opinion of the court, has considered the ques
tion from one standpoint only, namely, does the
war revenue act of 1898 forbid express companies
making contracts with shippers whereby the burden
of the stamp tax on bills of lading may be shifted?
In other words, does that statute arbitrarily require
thoÂ«e corporations to pay the tax and cut off the
right of shippers to negotiate upon the subject?
Notwithstanding Justices Harlan and McKenna
dissented on the ground that in their opinion the act
imposes upon carriers of express packages the duty
not only of affixing to bills of lading at their own
expense the required stamp â thus providing shippers
with a receipt which may, if necessary, be used as
evidence â there is much authority for holding as
Justice White has hold. The broad basis of his ar
gument is that the Government in the war revenue
act has not concerned itself with the identity of the
rerson who pays the tax. The purpose of the law
is satisfied when the money is collected, and no ru
ternpt has been made to cut off the right of taxpay
ers to adjust among themselves the burden of the
taxation. It is a fact, as the learned jurist says, that
taxes are paid by the users rather than the owners
of property. Thus landlords add taxes to their rent,
lessors to the amounts demanded for their leases,
merchants to the prices of their wares and farmers
UÂ« the value of their products.
So, finding nothing in the war revenue act which
forbids express companies demanding payment of tHe
stamp tax from shippers, or from* increasing their
rates to meet the cost of the stamps in case the de
mand is. refused, Justice White holds that the burden
may be shifted and that either party to the contract
of carriage may provide the stamp and cancel it.
But whether this is good law or not, it docs not
apply to California. Here the provisions of the Civil
(.'ode expressly impose the duty of issuing a legal bill
of lading upon the carriers of express packages, and
such a receipt is certainly one duly stamped. A con
sideration of the foUowing sections of the code re
ferred to will make this clear:
"2168. Every one who offers to the public to carry
persons, property or messages, excepting only tele
graphic messages, is a common carrier of whatever he
thus offers to carry.
"2169. A common carrier mint, if able to do so,
accept and carry whatever is offered to him, at a rea
sonable time and place, of a kind that he undertakes
or is accustomed to carry.
"2130. A carrier must subscribe and deliver to the
consignor, on demand, any reasonable number of
bills of lading, of the same tenor, expressing truly the
original contract of carriage; and if he refuses to do
so. the consignor may take the freight from him, and
recover from him besides all damages thereby occa
sioned."
Perhaps the statutes of Michigan do not contain
provisions sijnilar to these. If they do, they were not
cited in the case of the American Express Company
and, therefore, were not. considered by Justice White.
Wells. Fargo & Co. does business in this State by
virtue of a local franchise, although incorporated un
der the laws of Colorado. The corporation is bound
to obey the laws of this commonwealth .where they do
net conflict with the rights accorded to it as sn in-

THE CASE OF QUAY.
THE country is to be congratulated upon the re- j
fusal of the Senate to seat Mr. Quay upon an j
appointment by the Governor when a session of {
ihr. Legislature had intervened between the vacancy :
and the appointment. This congratulation ha; noth- i
ing whatever to do with the personality of Mr.
Uvzy, ::or the factional fight in the Republican party
of Pennsylvania. The motive for felicitation over
the event lies solely in i;s vindication of sound con
stitutional construction, in line with a precedent es- j
tablisbcd by the Senate when makers of the consti
tution were members of that body.
It must not be forgotten that the apparent cer
tainty that Quay would be seated on his appointment |
!:<is caused proposiiions for amending the constitu- j
ti'.n. It is a comment upon the loose thinking of the
time, that violation of the constitution should be
given as a reason for amending it. The surest way
t'> preserve the fundamental law in the symmetry in
which it was created is to strictly observe its pro- j
visions. j
That the Senate has done =0 we have no doubt.
The Ca'.l is gratified that its view of the case has been i
\ indicated by the Senate, as well as its judgment as
to the result of Quay's case.
There v.ere some noteworthy changes of opinion j
indicated in the vote, not apparently justified by any i
popular instruction, and one of these was by Sena- j
tor Perkins. Senator Bard stood by the sound and
unbroken construction of the constitution and killc! j
the vote of his colleague.
A TAX-SHIRKING DODGE
Ah v.a^ expected, an cnort is to be made to en
aLle the telephone company to evade the pay
ment of the amount due under the ordinance
imposing a tax of ?^ a quarter upon all niekel-in-the
slot machines operated for grain in the city. It I*s now
claimed that the tax is invalid so far as the telephone
companies are concerned, because it does not in th<
title specify that telephone slot machines are to be
subject to it.
It is provided in the charter: "An ordinance shali
embrace but one subject, which subject shall be ex
pressed in its title. If any subject be embraced in ar
ordinance and not expressed in its title, said ordi
jiance fhall be void only as to so much thereof as is
not expressed in its title. " The order fixing license
fees for nickel-in -thc-slot machines is in three sec
tions, the title of the second section being "weighing,
phonographic, forttme-tellfng, punching, lifting, elec
tric machines, etc." It will be seen that nothing is said
of telephones or kinctoscopes but it is specified that
electric machines shall be taxed, and the abbreviation
etc. is added to cover all other slot machines of the
kind.
The telephone machines arc nickcl-in-the-slot ma
chines and electric machines. They arc therefore
sufficiently described by the title. Furthermore, zi
Supervisor- McCarthy has pointed out- in an inter
view, "a large part of the back taxes .due by th:
telephone company under the order accrued before
the charter went into operation, and until the be
ginning of the present year there was no such regula
tion in force regarding the titles of orders."
The issue is one for the courts to decide, and the
test should be speedily made. It will be the duty of
thr.Tax Collector to collect the back taxes as soon
as he receives the resolutions of the Supervisors in
structing him to do 50. The telephone company has
shirked it* V>kvs for so long a time that it will of
course make a hard Tight against paying them now.
therefore it behooves the officers of the city to be
resolute. in enforcing the law. We shall of course
have further threats from the telephone company "to
put it in Â»he bill," but that is another issue â one that
can be dealt with on!y when the municipal au
thorities arc given power to regulate the charges of
telephone corporations in the same manner as otherji
controlling and operating public utilities.
The fight of the independent tobacco producers iii
this State against the trust seems to have reached ti:e
expected result. It has gone up in smoke.
This big slxteen-inch gun will be completed In a few days at the armory at Watervleit. X. T. It Is the biggest rjn of
Its kind in America. The intention Is to mount this majestic piece of ordnance at Sandy Hook, to form a part of th ; pow
erful defenses there. Without the carriage it -weighs 126 tons. The projectile it uses -neighs 2370 pounds, and it r <juires
' ItOO pounds of powder to start it on its flight. Every time the gun Is fired it costs SSS3. The gun has a rar.se of more than
twenty miles, and to attain the maximum range the projectile must rise to a height of nearly five miles.
BIGGEST GUN IN AMERICA ALMOST COMPLETED
Weary Women,
The attention of the Postmaster has been directed to the fact that
a number of employes in this service are frequent visitors at the race
track for the purpose of gambling.
Believing the practice to be a most pernicious one, and having in
view the ruin and disgrace which have come to so many men from indul
gence in this vice, he takes this occasion to solemnly warn and admon
ish the clerks and carriers of this service.
It is a fair presumption, supported by abundant evidence, that
the man who gambles is not a safe person to be intrusted with hand
ling the mail or property of others. The Postmaster believes the de
partment will take this view of the subject, and he now gives notice
that he will promptly report to the First Assistant Postmaster General
the names of all employes who continue to play the races or to visit
gambling resorts, with a recommendation that they be peremptorily re
moved from the service as unfit for the responsibilities of public offlcÂ©.

and was sent into quarantine. The heavy
northwester that has been raging off the
coast for the last few days delayed the*
vessel nearly ten hours, and everybody on
board was glad when port was reached.
Over two hundred passengers came up on
the mail steamer. During the afternoon
those In the cabin were released and land
ed at Pacific street. Nearly every one
who came up on the Australia has been
waiting for weeks to get away from the
islands. The Australia being the only ves
sel that could handle them, everybody
had to take hiÂ« turn. As there have been
no new cases of the plague in the Islands
and the quarantine is to be raised on
May 1. the chances are that all the steam
ers' leaving th*> islands after that date
will carry passengers, and the rush to
reach California will soon be over.
The cabin passengers on the Australia
were:
A Drier, wife and four children: H. Renjes.
wife and child; K. W. Meier, wife, two chil

There are 117 passengers in the steerage
still aboard the steamer. This is the first
time in nearly two months that the mail
boat has carried second-class passengers.
Several of them are Gallcians who
created such a stir in Hawaii a year ago.
They violated their contrnct with the
sugar planters and were Imprisoned for
doing so. The Australia besides a general
cargo brought from Honolulu six boxes
of coin valued at $150,000.
The Australia brings the news that the
steamer Charles Nelson went ashore on
a reef at Kauai. She was got off with the
losa of an anchor and a few fathoms of
chain. While at Hanamaula a slight fire
started in the lime cargo, but was put out
without much damage.
Nippon Maru Sails.
The Japanese mail steamer Nippon Ma
ru sailed for the Orient yesterday. Just
before she got away twenty-six Japanese
were removed from her to the steamer
Umatiila. The latter vessel will take
them to Puget Sound and from Victoria
or Vancouver. B. C, It Is expected they
will make their way back into California
by the "underground route."
Among those who went away on the
vessel were YV. F. Aldrich, deputy United
States Consul at Hongkong, and Robert
McWade. United States Consul at Amoy.
On account of the troublous times in
China both men were hurrying back to
their posts. George T. Keys we/it out
as purser of the Nippon Maru. W. H. Nel
son, the regular officer having to remain
behind on account of ill health. Dr. Fine,
who on account of sickness had to leave
the vessel at Honolulu on her last trip to
the Orient, was able to go out on the
steamer on this occasion.

Water Front Notes.
H. Rhine, proprietor of a candy factory
at 210 Sacramento street, and D. Stock
warts, his assistant, were treated at the
Harbor Hospital by Dr. Hoper yesterday
for severe burns on the hands and fore
arms. The men were superintending the
boiling of molasses candy when the mix
ture boiled over and caught fire. They
attempted to extinguish the blaze with
their hands.
Albert Rosser. a teamster, puzzled the
doctors at the Harbor Hospital yesterday.
He fell off his wagon on Main-street
wharf and was unconscious for seveYal
minutes. The ambulance was called, but
when it arrived Rosser refused to go in
it. saying he was all right. Later hr was
taken to the hospital by a friend and a
fey.- minutes after he was placed on the
operating table seemed to lose all power
over his limbs. Dr. Putnam examined him
thoroughly, but could find no trace of a
bruise "on 'his body except a slight discol
oration over the left eye. Rosser tried to
eet out of bed Uvioe and as many times
the hospital attendants found him In a
heap on the floor. â¢
The bark Albert arrived from Honolulu
yesterday and was placed in quarantine.
She got away without her clearance pa
pers. As they came up on the Nippon
Maru and were awaiting her arrival there
will be no trouble.
The new schooner Sehome arrived from
New AVhatcom yesterday after a smart
passage of tive days. She dragged consid
erably off Meiggs wharf. In order to get
clear she had to slip her anchor, losing the
rmid hook and fifty fathoms of chain.
Captain Gammons has taken command

schooner reports havinp encountered a
heavy northwest pale after he had been
to sea several days, which carrier] away
some of the rigsinp and otherwise injured
the vessel.
Hale Bros. Will Soon Exhibit Montgomery's Famous Picture Entitled, "A "Farm Ballad."
ALFRED MONTGOMERY'S famous painting entitled "A
Farm Ballad" has been purchased by Hale Bros., i lie
well known merchants of this city. The sum of $10,000
was paid for the magnificent picture from the brush of
the talented American, and it will be placed on exhibition to
the public on the opening of Hale Bros.* new store, which the
firm will occupy on the completion of the handsome- Btrueture
new in course of construction on Market street, near Sixth.
"A Farm Ballad" represents such a scone as one often pees
in Western farm life. Jt is the interior of an ol(l-fa?hioned.
homely barn which is a feature among the older Western
ranches. In the background are seen several barrels full of corn
on the cob. In different parts of the picture are seen sacks of
corn, loose corn and a pumpkin or two. So strikingly and ex
ceptionally true to nature is this picture of corn that it has
created considerable comment among artists and critics.

â Mbs Elsie Bbyax, Otisville, Mich.
With Adiison's aid the Tatler ran on
some two years ar.d then ceased to ap
pear, but only to make way for the Spec
tator.
The Spectator.
The Spectator Is Addison"s work as tho
Tatler is Steele'.*. Of the 563 papers Ad
dtson contributed 274, as against 23rt by
Steele. But there is more than this. Tho
Spectator himself, the fictitious person
ality from whom the paper was supposed
to proceed, is Addison. or. better. Addi
son s life mask. Around him are grouped
the figures of Sir Roger, Will Honey
comh. t'aptain Sentry and others, orig
inally designed by Steele, but instantly
appropriated by Addison. When we open
the old volumes of the Spectator we turn
at onct- to Sir Roger at church. Tlslttng
the theater or rowing to Spring Garden
with the one-legged waterman who had
fought at La Hogue. and this ia all puro
Addison. It was Artdison. too. who struck
out the news Items which had once filled
so much Of the Tatler and replaced
S'eele's lively-'theatrieal notices by tho
famous critical papers on "False ami Tru<Â»
Wit" and the then unknown epic of
"Paradise Lost."
We must not be unjust to Steele. He
has suffered much from his detractor
Macaulay; more, perhaps, from his frieni
Thackeray. Only of late years la a tardy
tribute being rendered to his delightful
genius. He was by far the more original
of the two: franker, gayer and more sym
pathetic than Addison. Nothing that th-Â»
more perfect artist has written ap
proaches in poignant human pathos th*
lines in which Steele tells of his first
childish apprehension of sorrow, or nar
rates the death of his old friend's Wife.
It Is a characteristic story, too charac-
Uristic not to be true, that Steele brokft
into t^ars over this last paper and left it
to AdUison to supply the moralizing close
with its apt quotation from "Paradisft
Lost" and its serene rebuke to Mr. Dry
den.
Between them Steele and Addison car
ried the Spectator to the highest pitch of
popularity. It penetrated to the remotest
corners -of the kingdom, lay on the morn
ing tea tray of the young lady of fashion
and made the round of the coffee-houses.
Even royalty began the day with the
Spectator. It was insued daily and before
its close had attained a circulation of 10.
000 copies. As fast a.-Â» numbers enousrh
appeared they were hound up In octavo
volumes, and over CfjOO of these were sold
at a guinea apiece. Considering the limit
ed number of the reading public at that
time, we may well believe Macaulay'*
statement that the popularity of the
Spectator rivaled that of the Waverley
novels or the most successful works of
Dickens.
The Close of the Period.
Politics proved the ruin of the periodi
cal literature of that age. Tho Spectator
was non-narti.san. but the restless spirit
of Steele had long been rhaftn; under the
onslaught of the Tory Examiner, and he
brought the Spectator to a close on De
cember 6, 1712. in order to start the Guar
dian, in which the political element speed
ily assumed the predominance. Tn October
of the following year he founded the
P^nglishman, "to rouse In this divided na
tion that lost thine called Publick Spirit."
Unfortunately public spirit when invoked
by the press Is only too apt to appear In
the form of party strife, and in the spring
of 1714 Steele was expelled from his newly
won seat in the Commons for certain ut
terances in the Knglishman and for his
pamphlet "The Crisis."
In the following year Addison was en
gaged by the Government, now thorough
ly Whig, to support the House of Han
over in a paper entitled the Freeholder.
In 17irÂ» we even find the old friends ami
allies at daggers-drawn over the peerage
bill. Steele attacked the measure in the
Plebeian, to .which Addison Immediately
responded in the Old Whig. There was an
unseemly change of personalities and a
rupture which was never healed in thin
world. For a little while Steele cherished
his anger, but his generous nature over
came his resentment and he paid In the>
Theatre and the preface to "The Drum
mer" full and noble homage to "that ex
cellent man whom heaven made his friend
and his superior, â¢ * â¢ whom he had
almost worshiped while living."
Steele survived Addison about ten year?.
But the golden age of the periodical esÂ«<r>y
wa.Â«Â« passed long before his death. The
type which he had created and Addison
perfected had but a brief existence. Yet
it Is impossible to overestimate Its \-alue.
Not only did it set a model for English
prose style, witty, lively, transparently
clear and exquisitely tactful, but it
played the part of moral censor to an as<>
whose excesses cri^d aloud for such an
officer. It taught a frlTPtoqa and skeptical
world that vice, not virtue, was the proper
target of satire: that a man might act
ually love his wife without exciting public
ridicule, and that there was no necessary
contradiction between the characters o"f
a gentleman and a Christian. And to us
in these later days what a picture it pre
sents of the "teacup times of hood and
hnop."
"As we read 'in thesÂ«Â» delightful volumes
of the Tatler and thÂ«Â» Spectator." says
Thackeray, "the past age returns, the
England of our ancestors is revivified.
Th*> Maypole rises In the Strand acaln in
London; the churches are thmncrori with
daily worshipers; the b*>aux are gathering
In the coffee-houses: thf> gentry arf goirirr
to the drawing-room: the ladles arÂ»
thronging tn the toy shop?; tho chairmen
are jostling in the streets: the footman
ar<* running with links before thp chariots
or fighting around the theater doors."

XVTII. EARLY BRITISH PEEI
ODICALS.
BY THOMAS MARC PARROTT, PH.D.
The origin of English periodical litera
ture may bo traced back to the Courant
or Weekly News, published at Irregular
Intervals from 1621 to 1841 by Nathaniel
Butter. This was an attempt to give the
public at largo what had before been the
privilege of those rich enough to pay a
newswrlter. It had to contend on the one
hand against the severity of the official
censor, and on the other against the in
difference of the public. But with the ad
vent of the Long Parliament the censor
ship was temporarily overthrown and the
public awakened to the liveliest interest
in the events of the day. Consequently
the period of the civil wars is marked by
the sudden and numerous appearance of
Intelligencers. Diurnals and Mercuries.
Bitterly partisan in tone, these were not
so much newspapers as weekly outbursts
of scurrility. The Mereurius Aulicus of
Oxford advocated the royal cause '^with
a great deal of wit and buffoonery." Its
rival, the Morcurius Britannicus. was the
work of Marchmont Nedham, styled by
his enemies "that Goliath of the Philis
tines." But the Restoration put a sharp
and sudden stop to these productions.
Roger L'Estrange became at once the
censor of the press and the publisher of
the official organ, which doled out such
scraps of news as royalty deigned to al
low its subjects. After the Revolution,
however, the press sprang Into lusty life.
Three newspapers appeared on the very
day after James fled from London, and
such a publication as the Athenian Mer
cury, a mild weekly, which discussed
philosophic and fanciful questions, show
ed a demand on the part of the public for
something more and better than broken
bits of news.
This demand Daniel Defoe from his un
comfortable quarters in Newgate under
took to gratify. His Weekly Review of
the Affairs of France (1704-14) was the
first step toward higher Journalism, and
Defoe was the first editor in our modern
sense. He not only gave the news, but
commented upon it. warned the people
against the prevailing frauds and follies
of the day, and in a department entitled
"Advice From the Scandalous Club" gave
"a weekly history of nonsense, imperti
nence, vice and debauchery."
The game of publication went merrily
on. By 1709 there were six periodicals ap
pearing on Monday. Wednesday and Fri
day, and a round dozen on the alternate
days on which the Dost left London.
The Tatlei
Tn the midst of this jostlinpr thronsr
there appeared the Tatler. owned. Pilited
and in great part written by Richard
Steek; Esq. Always in financial straits.
Steele was .it this time looking about for
some means of adding to his income; pos
sibly the need of supplying â¢ > Prue" with
guineas "for her pocket" was more than
usually imperative. The issue of a period
ical somewhat above the common type
promised to be remunerative, for he had
special inducements to offer the public. As
editor of the official Gazette he would
have early and authentic news of the war
in Spain and Flanders. a.Â« a gentleman of
the beau mende he could serve up under
the thin disguise of classic names the
latest goÂ«sip of court and town, as poet
and playwright he could furnish news of
the world of letters, and. lastly, as author
of the Christian Hero and self-appointed
censor morum he could continue the at
tack on fashionable dissipation begun by
Jeremy Collier and Jonathan Swift. AH
that was needed was a fictitious person
ality to give unity and character to the
periodical, and for this he seized upon the
mock astrologer, Isaac BiekerstafT. whom
Swift had created a year before to the
conf usi >n and ridicule of old Partridge,
the cobbler, astrologer and almanac
maker of the day.
The Tatler was published tri-weekly on
the post days. The first four numbers
were distributed gratis, after which the
price was fixed at a penny, a humorous
apology in the first number recounting
the pains and expense to which Mr. Bick
erstafE was put in gathering news at the
coffee-houses. Steele took pains, no doubt,
but I fancy he was put to little extraor
dinary expense in collecting material for
the Tatler. All was stuff that came in
his way, Thus in the first few numbers
we have a bit of society gossip, a report
of the benefit for the old tragedian. Bet
terton. the news of the gathering of the
forces for the campaign of Malplariuet. a
eulogy of the Whig Ministry, a broadly
humorous sketch of the adventures of a
strolling pack of players, and an out
spoken rebuke of a young nobleman for
coming drunk into the theater.
From first to last Steele was responsi
ble for the Tatler. and by far the greater
number of its papers are his work. Swift,
indeed, gave occasional aid. and the
names of one or two others are mention' d
as contributors. But to o,untf> Steelo's
own word.'-: "1 have only one gentleman,
who will be nameless, to thank for any
frequent jussistancf. * * * THis good Of
fice he performed with such force of
Genius. Humor. Wit and Learning that I
fared like a distressed Prinfe who calls in
a powerful Neighbor to his Aid. T was
undone by my Auxiliary: when I had on^<Â»
called him in. T could not subsist without
Dependence on him." The nameless gen
tleman was. of course. Steele's old friend.

CHICAGO, April 25.â Wheat began the day
fairly active and firm. Liverpool was strong,
receipts were moderate and there was a good
demand from foreigners. Moreover the pres
sure from longs seemed to be past. Offerings
were light and there was a tair amount of
buying by commission houses. This caused
a gradual advance which was helped along
forcefully by the great corn strength and the
close was very close to the top. Shorts covered
freely throughout most of the session. May
opened hiQ\c over yesterday at 65^@65%c
sold between CSH'SSGVio, closing %c improved at
C6c: July opened up at 67 I / iÂ«'s67'ic, ranged
from 67Â»,ic to 6'%c and closed lc higher at
Corn was strong and active throughout the
day, but the trade was not large. Offerings
were too small. For such as was offered there
was a scramble between longs and shorts with
the latter the more urgent in their demands
There was a brisk demand for export. May
closed 14c improved at 39*ic; July, 1% C im
proved at 40% c.
Oats were firm, helped by corn and wheat,
and closed ',4c over yesterday at 23Hc - July

The corn strength was the principal factor
in the firmness which was displayed In the
provision market. The depression was over
come by the corn strength, shorts covering

lard closed 15c Improved and July ribs 7^4c up.

Xevc York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, April 21.â The stock market
was in large part confined to Sugar to-day.
th# feverish and violent fluctuations in which
kept affairs so unsettled that the operators
hesitated to make, ventures and the volume of
dealings fell to small proportions. There was
no actual news development to account for
Sugar's erratic course, though the boardroom
was flooded with rumors all day of a settle
ment of the trade war absorption of rival
refineries, etc. It ran pretty evident that
these were set afloat bj the manipulators
for a rise, which was directed against the
short interest reputed to be largely concen
trated in Boston. The etock coM at< low as
VA in the morning on supposed indications of
frerh rigor in the trade war and in the alter
noon Jt got up to Hit,. It closed at a net
SKin of IH. The general market sold off
after the opening in fyir.pathy with the break
in Sugar, which effectually dominated the
tone of the market all day. When Sugar re
buunded the room-tndcra all turned to the
bull vde and kept price* up en a small vol
ume at deailas*. There were movements In
rpfcial Etock* designed to help on an ndvanc*.
notably in Missouri Pacific. Pennsylvania.
Ws;l<aFh preferred and the grangers, but it was
noticeable that the buying showed a remark
able fulling off on liny advance. Many buy
ing orders came in on thÂ«? Â«-arly decline, but
later in the day the market became duil. The
apathy ul trade caused realliin*: by *ie room
traders and a late reaction which wiped out
many of the gains. .The cloring was easy
ami the net result* for the day wore much
mixed. The introduction in Congress of a
resolution for a committee to investigate the
eteel and wire , Â«-piS'Â»de and the New York
f-tfick Exchange may have had fome influence
in the late reaction. The 'announcement of a
â¢mall eiiÃagen.ent of sold v, T Europe had lit
tle Influence. The amount. 1250.000, is believed
to be destined for Paris. The sterling ex
change rate was eaMer, failing %c. This !
leave* the q-jehtinn at further gold exports
more doubtful again. The lack of a fast !
*l<-Â»ni<r :hi* week is offered by â¢ .me bankers
af a rmt-'.zi for retraining from (-hipping gold !
during the period. Discounts in London were |
eiifehtiy easier to-,lay. but money In New York

-Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. April 25.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
Wool dealers continue to report some look-
Ing around on the part of manufacturers, and in
a few Instances the latter have taken some fair
lines of wools. The aggregate of the business
done, however, during the past week figures
upon only a moderate total. In fact the mar
ket has seldom presented a quieter nspect,
taken as a whole, than It has this week. An
undertone of confidence exists In the wool
trade, notwithstanding the quiet business pre
vailing and the market Is steady with practic
ally unchanged prices.

London Market.
NEW YORK. April 2:.. -The. Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
markets here were irregular and quiet to-day,
suggesting dragging markets for some time
The settlement disclosed only small specula
tion. Oontangoes were a trifle stiffer, merely be
cause of the long account. Consols and the
war loan hardened.
Americans were very idle. They opened firm
er, but were neglected and New York sold, a
partial recovery following a general slight ral
ly. The contango in Americans was 6@6%. Bal
timore and Ohio, N. &. AW. Pennsylvania and
St. Puul were scarce. The bank lost Â£20.000
gold to Brazil. The week's influx was Â£40,000.
Anacondas were weak on the closing of large
options, although the metal was better. Tln
tos spurted to 53 on the contango, which opened
at 3 and went off to 2. ...
Call money was wanted and bills were of
fered In moderate supply. The bank did a large
business in discounts and a few loans due
were renewed.
American sellers of silver are holding out
for 1 1-16 more. It Is thought unlikely that
they will get It.

WHO HAS MADE A HIT
MISS ETTA BUTLER, WHO WILL APPEAR AT THE ORPHEUM,
PRETTY and talented Etta Butler,
the San Francisco girl who scored
such a great hit in vaudeville in the
East, will shortly be seen at the
Orpheum. This will be pleasant news to
her friends and admirers, as they will look
forward to the time that they can see the
clever young lady in, her specialties.
Eight months ago Miss Butler was not
known outside of an extensive local ac
quaintance. Manager John Morrisey took
her in hand .last November and pro-
cured for hpr an engagement over the Or
pheum circuit. On reaching New York
she took the metropolis by storm. She
has been applauded, feted, proposed to,
deluged with all sorts of managerial of
fers, and is now back again and will on
Sunday evening next appear at the local
theater as one of the head-liners on the

Miss Butler's specialty is the art of

FRESXO. April 23.â The annual conven
tion of Supervisors of the State met this
forenoon in Judge Risley's department of
the Superior Court and transacted a very
large amount of business. The papers
were able and thorough and the discus
sions were earnest, displaying accurate
special knowledge, gained from actual ex
perience on the subjects treated.
Chairman Sayrc of the Fresno board,
who. according to the usual courtesy,
would have been selected as chairman,
waived the honor, and thereupon Orrin S.

Frank Jordan. The committee on reso
lutions asked that the chairman appoint
a separate committee to draft resolutions
of respect to the memory of the late S. F.
Ayer, whose death occurred since the last
meeting of the committee.
The convention then adjourned until 1
o'clock. While the convention adjourned
to meet promptly at 1 o'clock, it was 1:40
when Chairman Henderson again called
the State aupervisors to order.
The chair called upon Clerk Cummings
to read the paper, "The Wide Tire Law,"
prepared by L. A. Chittenden
of Kings County, who, on account of busi
ness reasons, was unable to be present lh

The paper was a strong plea for broad
tires, as a preventive of ruts and holes so
common in the sand and clay roads of the
San Joaquin Valley; The narrow tire was
characterized as a road destroyer. On
motion the chair was instructed to ap
point a committee of three to draft suit
able resoluti6ns in favor of a wide tire
law to be submitted to the next Legisla
ture.
Chairman Henderson then read a paper
prepared by himself on the subject of
"County Government." It was a brilliant
paper, full of valuable points, and dwell
ing especially on the lack of community
Interest in counties far remote, as for in
stance San Diego and Siskiyou. which
seem to have no concern in the matter of
county government outside of their own
limits.
Other papers read were as follows: Ar

to City and Country Districts." "Road

bringing about a feeling of harmony be

sioners saw fit to ignore the letter. He
said he knew that in the strict enforce
ment of the law the Police Commission

the letter he simply wished both boards
to get together and amicably agree on an
ordinance that would not only be satis

UNITED ANGLO-SAXON
CATHOLIC PROPAGANDA
Archbishop Ireland's Suggestion Said
to Be Frowned Upon at the
P;Â«v-ta! Dl!>riatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 23.â Archbishop Ire
land has written a letter to the Duke of
Norfolk, president of the Catholic Union
of Great Hritain. In which he urges a
united Anglo-Saxon Catholic propaganda.
A cable from Rome last week says the
letter is distrusted at the Vatican, where
it is regarded as an effort to revive the
liberal movement known as Americanism.
A copy of Archbishop Ireland's letter
has just been received here. It deals at
length with the opportunity before the
Catholic church In English-speaking
countries, and lays especial emphasis on
the fact that the English language Is
circling the globe. All this the Arch
bishop points out. cannot be too strongly
Impressed upon the authorities of the
church. In part the Archbishop says:
"It is broad, plain fact in the geography
of the world that the English language is
circling the globe. English-speaking coun
tries are constantly growing with a speed
nothing is able to arrest. In territory and
In influence. Very much of the mission
ary work of the church Is to be done
under English-speaking countries. Hence
It Is the mission imposed by providence
upon English-speaking Catholics to
make the English language bearer of
Catholic verities to hundreds of million*
who will eceak and read it."

A BUSY FACTORY.
Never Closes Its Doors, Day or Night.
The famous "white city," as the pure
food factories of the Postum Cereal Co.,
Ltd., of Battle Creek, Mich., are called,
never shuts down day or night
The great ovens once heated up
are kept going, as are the grinding
mills, blending machines, mixing ma-
chines, and the entire plant; the day
laborers, men and women, are replaced
at 6 o'clock in the evening by a night
force.
The name "white city" was K'ven by
the citizens to the location owing to the
color of the nuraeroas factory buildings,
which arc painted pure white with very
dark bronze preen trimmings.
The utmost cleanliness is observed
throughout, and the appetizing odors
from the foods in preparation permeate
the air in all directions.
Their products. Grape-Xuts breakfast
food and Posturn Cereal Food Coffee.
}-o all over the word to the breakfast
tables of the well-to-do Japanese and
Chinese, and to the high caste Brah-
mins of India, to the Emperor of Ger-
many, to Royalty in Italy, to Great
Britain. South America, and they are
found in practically all of the best
homes in America.
By scientific selection of the certain
parts of grain? which supply Phosphate
of Potash and other important element?
for quickly rebuilding the most delicate
parts of the human body (brain and
â¢icrve centers), and making up there-
from a most delicious food. Grape-
Xuts. and a breakfast food-drink, PoÂ«-
tum' Cereal Coffee, this firm has be-
rome known as the foremost producers
of Health Foods in the world, and their
r.arne affixed to a packape of food is
fufficient evidence oi its purity and ex-
cellence.

ERNEST HOGAN SUES
STEAMSHIP COMPANY
i Says the Captain of theMiowera Drew
the Color Line on His Troupe
of Comedians.
Special Corre?r>ondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, H. 1.. April 17.âTwenty
: nine separate suits for damages, aggre
' gating over a half million dollars, have
i been brought against the C. A. S. S. Com
Â¦ pany, owners of the Miowera, Warrimoo
. and Aorangi, boats plying between the
colonies, Honolulu, Vancouver and Vic
toria, by Ernest Hogan, the colored come
dian, and the members of his minstrel
i troupe. The cases will be tried during
i the May term, and should the court grant
judgment the Miowera or any other boat
of the line will be seized upon her arrival
in port.
Hogan and his company came from Syd
ney second class in one of the C A. S. S.
Co. 'B boats some six or eight weeks ago
j and had tickets permitting them to st^p
] over here. They finished their engage
i ment at the Orpheum and having under
| gone all the health regulations were ex
! pectlng to leave in the Miowera. When
this steamer arrived both the captain and
; the agents refused to take the colored
: people aboard, stating that they had ac
Â¦ commodatlons in neither the cabin nor the
' steerage. It was proved by both the
custom-house officers and others who
, went aboard that there was ample room.
; Of course, the color line was drawn, and
' Hosan and his people will do their best
to recover damages.
Struck by an Electric Car.
B. T. Bardeau, residing at 13 Rauch
street, jumped off an electric car at the
corner of Twenty-second and Kentucky
streets in front of another car last night.
He was knocked down and sustained a
fracture of the skull. He was taken to

not considtrf-d dangerous.
COMES TO THE RELIEF
OF THE SALOON-KEEPER
Supervisor Hotaling to Introduce an
Ordinance Which Will Prevent
Destruction of Property.
Drtpite the treatment accorded him by
the Board of Police Commissioners, Su
pervisor Hotaling does not intend resting
until he has afTord^d restaurant-keepers
and saloon men some relief from the or
dinance which compels them to cut down
partitions in private rooms.
Mr. Hotaling intends introducing an or
dinance at next Monday's meeting of th*
Board of Supervisory which will have this
end in view. As outlined in his spc-eeh to
the board at its la-st session. Supervisor
Hotaling contends that the enforcement
of the existing ordinance will result In the
destruction of decorations and fancy
woodwork which cost large sums of
money, and that such mutilation will not
only affect the pockets of the proprietors
but will cause loss and trouble to the
creditors. He believes that people who
desire to have supper In a back room of
a restaurant after the theater are entitled
to some degree of privacy. His ordinance
will be framed to remedy the defects in
the present law.

LONG SAID TO HAVE
REBUKED CHADWICK
Naval Captain May Be Court-Mar
tialed for His Attack Upon
Schley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 25â Secretary
Long is reported to have called the atten
tion of Captain Chadwick, who command
ed the armored cruiser Xew York during
the battle off Santiago de Cuba, to an in
terview credited to him and published a
few days ago, in which he bitterly assail
ed Rear Admiral Winfleld Scott Schley.
It Is known that the interview came to
the attention of the Secretary and that It
Is considered sufficiently serious to war
rant an explanation from Captain Chad
wick. Should Captain Chadwick admit
the interview, it Is likely that the depart
ment will feel In duty bound to make him
substantiate his statements. In this way
it is possible that the whole Sampson-
Schley controversy may be reopened.
In the Interview credited to him Captain
Chadwick is alleged to have made these
statements:
"Every one. of us feels the disgrace, that
Schley has put upon us. It Is not Samp
son or Schley that we care about or are
anxious to vindicate. It is the honor of
the navy that has been assailed. Its esprit
de corps that has received a serious blow,
and, in the opinion of the officers, it has
been injurious to us abroad by the dis
graceful exhibition of pettiness of which
Admiral Schley has been guilty.
"I have for him only contempt. I would
not shake his hand If he offered It to me,
and In this I believe I simply re-echo the
sentiments of almost the entire navy. If
Admiral Schley desires vindication, let
him ask for an Investigation of his con
duct. The men who fought the ships at
the battle of Santiago and the general
public, I am sure, desire such an investi
gation and will be. willing to abide by the
result, whatever it may be."
Those who are acquainted with Captain
Chadwick's sentiments would not be sur
prised if he should avow that he was
quoted correctly, but they express the
opinion that he would explain to the de
partment that he did not authorize the in
terview. In such a case it is difficult to
forecast the action of the department.
Section 226 of the navy regulations pro
hibit criticism of officers by their col
leagues. Should Captain Chadwick ndmit
that he made the statements quoted it is
likely that the friends of Schley will press
the department to order a court-martial.

HART IS SUFFERING
FROM NERVOUS COLLAPSE
His Friends Believe That a Few
Months' Rest Will Fully Re
store His Health.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 25.â The an
nouncementtin to-day's Call that formet
Attorney General A. L. Hart was in a
state of mental collapse at a Livermort
sanitarium created a sensation in legal
circles here, General Hart having been
for years one of the most brilliant mem
bers of the local bar. His brothers. Su
perior Judge E. C. Hart and Dr. A. C.
Hart, say that they are receiving favor
able reports as to the general's condition
and they are hopeful of his complete
restoration to health and strength of
mind.
They describe his condition as a nervous
collapse, due more to overwork than any
other cause and believe that with the
quiet which he shall be compelled to put
up with at the sanitarium he will soon
be himself again. They say that when
James Rhoades saw General Hart In San
Jose, as set forth in The Call, the gen
eral was in a state of great irritability,
but since then he has written an elabor
ate brief for presentation to the Supreme
Court and has shown other evidences of
clearness of intellect. They believe that
the rest will completely remove his dis
ability and are not in fear of any serious
termination of his case.
OHIO DEMOCRAT
PREDICTS CIVIL WAR
Declares That Even if Elected Bryan
Would Not Be Permitted to
Take Office.
WICHITA, Kans., April 25.â Allen O.
Meyers of Ohio, responding to a toast at
the banquet of the Sunflower League of
Kansas, following William J. Bryan, cre
ated a sensation by his utterances. Mr.
Bryan did not finish his speech until af
ter 1 o'clock this morning.
Mr. Meyers drew a dark picture. The
country was fast racing to destruction, he
said, and Mark Hanna, William McKtnley
and Great Britain were driving it. Then,
suddenly turning toward Mr. Bryan the
speaker* exclaimed:
"You may be elected, sir, by a million
majority, but they will not permit you to
take the Presidential chair. Look at the
fate of William Goebel In Kentucky. Men
whose pastime is bribery find In murder
an amusement. Ohio was bought in 1596,
the country was bought, it will be bought
again in 1900, and Mark Hanna's reward
for it Is a seat in the United States Sen
ate."
The masses of the country would con
tinue to permit the encroachment on the
classes, concluded Mr. Myers, until finally
too late for a restoration of rights by the
ballot. Then the sword and gun, violence,
revolution â a new order of things.

ROSINANTE, IN
A HARD DRIVE
FROM MY GYPSY
Diminutive Filly Beaten a
Neck in Record Time
at Oakland.
In. one of those hair-raising finishes for
which she is famous tho chestnut mare
Koslnante downed diminutive My Gypsy
a neck for the mile and a quarter event
at Oakland yesterday, equaling at the
same time the coast record of 2;ij6 for the
distance. While the beaten filly, as well
as The Fretter, received stanch support
in the ring:, the big bettors sent Rosin
ante to the post favorite. Coffey's mare
showed more early speed than usual and
with the exception of being jostled on the
backs tretch by Twinkler played in good
racing luck. My Gypsy struck the stretch
in front, but Ranch failed to snug up to
the rail, which fact Fauntleroy. on the
first choice, took advantage of and in a
highly exciting drive earned the decision
by a short neck. It was the only really
close thing of the day.
The talent nepa rated Itself from quite fi
bunch of coin over the defeats of Ella
Boland. Follow Me. Almoner and Oppo
nent, all selected ones In the betting. The
attendance was up to the average, with
no scarcity of coin in the bookmakers'
realm.
Ella Boland made a very poor showing
against May Gertrude in the opening five
and a ha!f furlong trip. The first named
filly closed a 7 to 10 chance and was beat
en in a common gallop by "Jim" Nealon's
sprinter, away to a running start.
Illllouon, from the Elmwood farm string,
took the two-year-old dash. Follow Me,
the favorite, quit be/ore the wire was
hardly in sight, losing by a couple of
lengths. With more luck Billy Lyons,
which ran third, could have won.
Of the eleven platers starting in the five
furlong-, all age spin. Almoner looked
about the most eligible, which caused him
to be installed favorite. Not overburdened
with speed and weakly ridden by Holmes,
both Reina de Cuba and Miss Soak fin
ished ahead of. the first choice. Nine and
ten to one were possibilities one time
about the winner.
Billy Maerane's useful colt Tuthill made
his company in the fifth number look very
cheap. A legitimate 3 to 5 chance. 6 to 5
was laid against him because Stuart had
the mount. Cue, a horse almost totally
blind, was touted about, receiving some
backing, as Willie See rode him. He
finished a close third to the favorite and
Proclamation.
Opponent enjoyed first call in the bet
ting on the last race. Johnny Woods
"booted" the Coffey entry, getting to the
stand in time to be led out two lengths hy
Wyoming. The winner was 7 to 2 at post
time.
Track Notes.
The stewards of the Western Turf As
sociation will meet again this evening at
the Palace Hotel. Denny Lynch will he
present and the charges mad? against
Joe PiSÃOtt by Jockey Hennessy will
probably be Riven an airinp.

Lord Beresford's Hat Sold to a Peddler
A shiny silk stovepipe hat consigned to
Lord Charles Beresford was among the
articles sold yesterday at auction at the
United States Appraiser's store. The pur
chaser was a peddler named J. Solomons,
who became its owner for the ridiculously
small and unaristocratic price of $2 75. t
The historic tile was brand new from a
London shop. When it arrived here Its
titled owner had gone away and It was
held for duty. It was appraised at $10,
home value, and $16 with the duty paid.
Chauncey St. John would have robbed the
descendant of King Solomon of the glory
of buying the hat, but it was too small
for Chauncey. . .. V

DEMOCRATS ARE
PREPARING FOR
THE CAMPAIGN
State Executive Committee
Will Meet Next
Monday.
Surmise That the Gallaghers Will
Make a Special Effort to Retain
Control of the Central
Organization.
>
The executive committee of the Demo,
cratlc State Central Committee will meet
at the California Hotel next Monday.
The members of the executive body are:
Seth Mann, chairman; James H..
Budd. James D. Phelan, W. H. Alford,
J. J. Dwyer, C. C. Wright, J. H. Seawell,
M. F. Tarpey, R. M. Fitzgerald, A. Cara
inetti. J. L. Gallagher, Charles XV. Fay,
J. C. McKlnstry, Charles M. Cassln. W.
H. Devlin and C. O. Dunbar.
Topics relating to the next State con
vention of the party will be discussed.
Doubtless a formal call for delegates to
assemble at Sacramento will be framed
for submission to the general committee,
which will meet In this city on May 5. The
question of apportionment will come up
for consideration.
There Is one point In which there may
be a division of sentiment. Several Demo
cratic leaders are in favor of placing in
the call a provision which will require the
convention to select a new State Central
Committee. Other statesmen fancy that
the convention should not be instructed
in this regard.
It Is surmised in political circles that the
Gallaghers, who managed the Maguire
campaign of 1698, are anxious to retain the
reins of party management. Consequent
ly agitation in favor of a new committee
excites their displeasure. It Is probable
that the convention to choose eighteen
delegates to the Kansas City natlonnl
convention will be held early In June. The
Gallagher programme Is to say nothing
of the State Central Committee' at the
early convention, but to Tefer the subject
to the convention which must assemble
In September to nominate Presidential
electors. When the proposition is brought
before the September convention objection
will be raised on the ground that no radi
cal change should be made in the middle
of the campaign.
The Democrats are not manifesting a
great deal of concern in, political affairs.
It seems to be regarded" as an accepted
fact that Bryan will be the nominee of
the Kansas City convention. The Gal
laghers will be as heartily for Bryan as
they were for Maguire. Politicians in the
party, however, call to mind that the Gal
laghers in the campaign of IS9B gave most
of their time to the worship of Maguire
and neglected the simplest affairs of party
organization. Maguire was placed on a
pedestal. He was exalted as the ideal
statesman. The committee consulted Ma
guire. The Gallaghers, when they found
it convenient, told the Democratic voters
how Mr. Maguire would like to have the
campaign conducted. The management
ran along In this fashion until Democrats
began to speak of the State Central Com
mittee as the suicide club. It Is appre
hended at this time that the Gallaghers,
if .allowed free swing, may place Bryan
on the Maguire pedestal and repeat the
stupid blunders of 189 S.
POLICE UNABLE
TO LOCATE THE
LONE FOOTPAD
Captain Seymour Believes
That He Is a Victim of
Dime Novels.
Detectives Swarm the Western Ad
dition in the Hope of Catch
ing Him While at
Work.
The lone highwayman who has been ter
rorizing the Western Addition Is still at
large. The police have been unable to se
cure the slightest clew that might lead to
his Identity. Referring to the case, Cap
tain of Detectives Seymour said;
"I think the fellow Is crazy. His actions
while holding up a victim show that he
Is mentally weak. I am satisfied that
when we land him he will prove to be a
pervert, whose mind has become unbal
anced through reading dime novels and
other trashy literature."
Last night a number of detectl\'es and
policemen in citizens' clothes were falling
over each other In the Western Addition,
all anxious to capture the robber. They
were specially Instructed not to take any
chances with him, as it is believed that
he will not hesitate to shoot In case he
Is cornered: Captain Seymour compares
the recent hold-ups with those committed
by a Swede named Peterson. Peterson
was a constant reader of dime novels.
After studying the exploits of Captain
Kidd the famous pirate of fiction. Peter
son resolved to emulate him. Buying a
cheap revolver and some cartridges he
started out on his career of crime. After
holding up a number of citizens and cre
ating a reign of terror he ran afoul of
Policeman Duff, who with nearly all the
available members of the department was
out looking for him. Duff saw the fellow
hold up a citizen. After he had relieved
him of his valuables he quietly walked up
to him and showing his star told him he
was under arrest. Peterson promptly
drew his revolver and fired at the officer.
the bullet striking him in the calf of the
leg. Before he had a chance to shoot
again Duff, who had fallen to the ground,
managed to draw his pistol, and pointing
it at the robber fired. The bullet struck
him in the forehead, killing him instantly.
A search of Peterson's room revealed a
large quantity of cheap novels, which he
had been In the habit of reading. It was
afterward ascertained that prior to be
coming a bold robber he was a hard work-
Ing fellow.
The methods employed by the Western
Addition burglar. Captain Seymour says,
are not those of an experienced criminal.
Chief of Police Sullivan, realizing that
the robber would not hesitate to commit
murder, sent for Captains Wittman and
Spl'.lane yesterday and had them give him
a list of their best men. When they ap
peared at police headquarters at 5 o'clock
last evening they were given a descrip
tion of the highwayman and Instructed to
arrest him. Special Instructions were
given to the officers to shoot him the In
stant he attempted to reach for his re
volver.

Charles Barbue Under Ar
rest for Robbing His Em
ployer's Warehouse.
Accused of Taking Wagon Loads of
Stored Furniture and Disposing
of It to Second-Hand
Dealers.
Charles P.arlvue. recelvin ? cierK ano
head warehouseman of tht Sterling Fur
niture Storage Company, was arrested
yesterday by Detectives Ryan and ODea
He is accused of selling furniture sent tc
the company's warehouse by the Indian
apolis Furniture Company. Barbue de
clares that he Is innocent. Part of the
Ftolen furniture has been recovered. Ac
cording to the story told by Hamilton
Page of the Indianapolis Furniture Com
pany, his concern, about seven or eight
Â¦redes ago. sent a lot of furniture to the
Sterling Company. Last week a pawn
broker, who does business on Mission
street, near Fifth, inquired for a cabinet
ot a peculiar pattern. Mr. Page remem
bered that such an article had been in
stock- The fact came out that it had been
sent to the Sterling warehouse, but it
could not be found there.
In the meantime the pawnbroker's wife
made eimilar inquiries of the Indianapolis
Company. She secured information as to
the price of the article. That was all she
desired, for the cabinet had at that time
bf-^n offered for sale to her husband.
The loss led Mr. Page to order an in
ventory of all his company's goods In the
Sterling warehouse. This revealed, that
nearly $000 worth of furniture was miss
ing.
John H. Wilson of the storage company
refused to believe that the articles had
b<Â»en received ;Â»t the warehouse and In
sinuated that the loss had taken place by
reason of the acts of one of the employes
of the furniture company.
Tho case was placed in the hands oj
the detectives, and they located some ol

A WOMAN in black, who gave her
name as Alice Horgan, applied to
Judge Mogan yesterday for pro
tection from the wrath of Annie
Clarke, an acquaintance. She claimed
that Annie had already assaulted her and
had threatened to finish the job later on
with a bottle of vitriol and a popgun. The
cause of the belligerent attitude of the
Clarke woman was not explained. Mrs.
Hogan vowed that she could assign no
reason for the attack, but it is believed
to be the outgrowth of a rival for the af
fections of the same young man.
"I am in fear of my life," she said.
"My name is Alice Horgan. I have been
married, but am now a widow. I am at
tending a business college, and on the
way to my home at 30S Sixth street yes.
terday afternoon a woman accosted me.
I recognized her as Annie Clarke, whom I
had known for years. I thought she was
in Nevada City and was astonished to
find her here.
"She seemed to be crazy, and as I greet
ed her pleasantly she struck me a vio
lent blow on the face, knocking me down.
She tore my silk waist into ribbons and
kicked me viciously wniie I was on the
ground. She said she would kill me and
would throw vitriol In my face. She act
ed like a fury. I shouted for help and
she ran away. She had no motive what
ever for attacking me and she must be
out of her mind. I have known her for a
number of years and we were always
friends."
The warrant was issued. An ofHcer was
detailed to walk behind Mrs. Horgan yes
terday as she was returning from college
in the hope that Miss Clarke would at
tempt to carry out her threats. The wo
man, however, did not make her appear
ance. Mrs. Horga.n is certain she will at
tempt to kill her.
STRUGGLED FOR
LIFE, BUT DEATH
WAS TRIUMPHANT
After Weeks of Lingering
Illness Miss Kate Can
trell Passes Away.
Was Accidentally Asphyxiated at
Her Parents' Home and Re
mained Unconscious Until
the End Came.
>
After two weeks of lingering sickness,
In which she never once regained con
sciousness. Miss Kate Cantrell died yes
terday morning at the home of her father,
1216 Larkin street. On the morning of
April 13 Miss Cantrell was found In bed
gasping for breath. The gas had been
partially turned on, but a window of the
room was slightly opened.
The night previous Miss Cantrell had
retired early. It was the custom of her
mother to awaken her every morning at
8 o'clock. Knocking at her daughter's
door, she received no response. The smell
of gas heightened the suspicions of some
grave accident. Mr. Cantrell was called
and he battered down the door. Dr.
Pring, the family physician, was sum
moned and he was in attendance until the
time of death.
Two days after the accident the effect
of the gas seemed to wear off, but the
young woman lapsed Into a comatose con
dition from which she never recovered.
Pneumonia due to the gas poisoning and
the weak condition of Miss Cantrell de
veloped later on.
The family scout all thought of suicide.
The young woman was always in the
highest spirits and had no mental trou
ble of any kind. On the mantelpiece in
her room were found two theater tickets
for a performance that evening. Presents
for her nieces and nephews were also dis
covered in the room.
When Dr. Pring arrived he could hardly
detect the odor of gas and thinks there
must have been v very small volume of
carbon monoxide in the room. Miss Can
trell was subject to a peculiar kind of
somnolence, often falling asleep at unex
pected times and being aroused with dif
ficulty. She was 3-1 years of age. Her'
father Is a member of the well-known
firm of Marshutz & Cantrell, proprietors
of the National Iron Works.

a Desperate Encounter.

Officers James O'Connor and John Da
vids of the California-street police sta
tion last night. Angelo Jambruno, alias
"Pogy," wanted on a number of criminal
charges and leader of the gang known
as the "Forty Thieves," against which
charges have been made to the Board of
Supervisors, was arrested after a long
chase and placed behind the bars.
Jambruno is a recognized crook. He has
avoided the service of warrants charging
him with various offenses. Last night
Otlicer O'Connor sighted him on Fran
cisco .street and immediately started to
arrest him. Jambruno saw the ufficer.

WITH ANOTHER CRIME
Partner in His Nome Venture Ac
cuses the St. Louis Man of
Embezzlement.
More trouble has been piled on the head
of Elmer L. Sheetz, or, as he calls him
self, W. A. Prince, the man who is want
ed in St. Louis for Jumping his bonds
after being arrested ' for a half-interest
swindle. James 11. Boland, who with
Sheetz and a man named E. M. Carson,
have been trying to load the schooner
Luisa D with freight and passengers for

charging Prince with embezzling $150
which he had collected.
Scheetz declared . yesterday that he
would never go back to St. Louis. He has
engaged an attorney to fight the extradi
tion pro<Â«eedings. It was to cover this ex
pense that ho is alleged to have held
back the $130.
The three men named are very mysteri
ous about the affairs of the Luisa D. One
of them stated however, that she belong
ed to the Hawkeye Prospecting Company
of lowa and that Sheetz agreed to pur
chase a third interest In the trip to Nome,
but failed to produce the cash.
Boland acknowledged that the vessel
was being outfitted with the money re
ceived from shippers and passengers. He
claimed when questioned that she was
properly provisioned and equipped, but
could not tell when she would get away.
END OF LONG ARGUMENT
OVER THE PENCIL DEEDS
Ex-Governor Budd and Charles Pence
Talk All Day â A Decision Ex
pected This Morning.
Arguments over the pencil deeds conten
tion in the Fair case were concluded yes
terday afternoon before Judge Troutt. The
decision whether they shall be admitted
in evidence will be handed down to-day.
Ex-Governor Budd completed his argu
ment in the morning and Charles Pence
used the afternoon in answer.
In substance ex-Governor Budd said:
"If the deeds are relevant to prove sup
port and maintenance it is relevant for us
to disprove these evidences of marriages
by the same means. If It be relevant for
one side it is relevant for the other. It
makes no difftrence wnether they were in
troduced for the sole purpose of contra
dicting the witness or to obtain a declara
tion that was material to the Issues and
related to the necessary facts of the case.
"A fact tending to prove status, an al
leged ceremony or consent, cohabitation
and support is a vital one and should be
allowed to be proved."
Charles Pence's argument was on the
law of the case, and decision after deci
sion was reeled off the spindle in support
of the petitioner's contention.
440 Green street. Lulgl had arranged to
start a rival bootblack stand on the same
block as Faggio. When the latter met
him Tuesday night he attacked him with
a pocket knife, cutting him on the left
arm. He made another slash at his neck,
but Luigi grappled with him and secured
the knife.

room was difficult to find. The pro
gramme, rendered under the direction of
Leader John A. Hammersmith, was filled
with surprises. There were athletic events
that thrilled the fair ones, and there was
singing and specialties to please the ear
and eye.
The programme opened with some very
clever work on the Koman rings by Han
lon and Singer. ; Then little Tryphena
Pritchard recited "The Clansman's Child"
with the grace and ability of a finished
actress. \\". J. Leonard and George An
derson. James Gaynor and Harold Ma
guire gave interesting sparring exhibi
tions; Mrs. George S. Miehling. wife of
the wrestling instructor of the club
scored a hit by her graceful swinging of
Indian clubs, and Miss Etta O'Brien sang
a number of sweet melodies. The fencing
exhibition between Professor Louis Tron
chet. fencing master of the club, and
Jacques Fritz, master at arms on board
the i-rench cruiser Protet, was full of ex
citement. The contestants were expert in
handling foil and rapier, and frequently
during the bout disarmed 1 each other and
scored heavily.
George Hammersmith sang a number of
popular ditties and introduced clever
specialties. A. M. Stones meteor act was
brilliant The wrestling bouts between
