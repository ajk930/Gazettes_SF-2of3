In this way and after a most stubborn
and persistent crusade by The Call a
great reform has been made In the Chi
nese traffic, which was disgracing the ad
ministration* of. Collector, j- Jackson -and
doing serious injury to the people of the
city and the State. Chinese yellow "citl-
"I suppose you have heard that The
Call has won its fight?" said Collector
Jackson in discussing the order which he
had received yesterday from Washington.
"I will obey the command of the Treas
ury," he continued. "Native-born Chi
nese immigrants will be examined on
board the steamer by the Chinese Bureau
as usual. Native-born Chinese come to
this port without certificates of any kind,
but they will be examined, nevertheless."
The importance of this victory cannot
be overestimated, for if Federal officials
be honest and vigilant in the performance
of their duties the tremendous and lucra
tive traffic in Chinese "native sons" has
been killed after the grossest frauds have
stained an administration in the city. The
orders to Collector Jackson to examine
Chinese native-born cases as hitherto
came yesterday morning from the Solici
tor of the United States treasury, who
based his command upon section 9 of the
act of 1SS2, which is known as the exclu
sion act. This section, which is of deep
significance to the people of this city not
only In this aspect but in another} equally
Important, reads as follows:
Section 9â That before any Chinese pas
sengers are landed from any such vessel
the Collector or his deputy shall proceed
to examine such passengers, comparing
the certificates with the list and with the
passengers; and no passengers shall bo
allowed to land in the United States from
such vessel in violation of law.
COLONEL JOHN P. JACKSON, Col
lector of the Port, has been com
manded by his superiors at Wash
ington to do what this paper urged
him to do and fo perform the duty which
United States District Attorney Frank L.
Coombs threatened to force him to per
form â hear preliminarily the cases of Chi
nese "native sons" before they leave the
vessel upon which they arrive. By orders
from Washington, received yesterday by
the Collector of the Port, a great victory
has been won over the corrupt ring which
is manufacturing "native-born citizens"
out of yellow coolies. Collector Jackson
has now but to keep the solemn promise
which he has made to the public, and
after securing the statements of coolie
"citizens." remand them to the United
States courts, where the question of their
nativity will be determined according to
law and in Justice to the evidence pre
sented.-

terms. To-day Governor Roosevelt called
upon President McKlnley, by whom he
was received with cordiality that almost
amounted to effusiveness. When the two
met there was quick, warm grasp of
hands, and with the first exchange of
greetings all formality ceased. The
President has not urged nor will he urge
Governor Roosevelt to accept the Vice
Presidential nomination. From an au
thoritative source Information has been
-received that there has not been any hint
at any bargain, nor will any political
agreement be discussed. Governor Roose

seeking the Presidents support for his

Shaded Portions of Diagram Show Lots Already Bought by Southern Pacific. \
It is said that the property that has
come into the possession of the Southern
Pacific Company was bought for it by an
Eastern real estate man named Davis,
who is entirely unknown In this city and
was probably brought out from New Yoik
by C. P. Huntlngton. The secrecy with
which the purchases have been made can
be best illustrated by the fact that owners
of adjoining pieces; of property have sold
to the mysterious agent- each without the
other knowing of It and that wily brokers
who have 1 sold for clients to the Eastern
great corporation desired to add to its
holdings. All unconscious that' they were
selling' to the railroad company or that
the property of their nfeiglibors all around
them was being gathered in by the same
purchaser, property owners have been
selling almost dally and piece after *piece
has gradually and quietly come into' the
possession of the Kentucky corporation.
through his absolute fidelity to duty and
largely through his own unaided efforts
in cross-examination. In nearly every
case he has been able to trap the yellow
impostors through the statements which
they made to the officers of the Chinese
Bureau on board ship. By command of
the Solicitor of the Treasury thÂ«Â»e state
ments Â¦will continue to be taken and will
serve as a great check upon fraud. Chi
nese witnesses are not anxious to go to
the penitentiary, and lawyers dealing in
Chinese are hot eager to stand the conse
quences of supplying perjured testimony.
The notorious "coaching" which has been
made in several law offices on Montgom
.ery street will probably cease.
In order that the effect of the splendid
victory may not be lost and that the
courts may be assisted in every possible
way United States Attorney Frank . L.
Coombs asked Chief Dunn of the Chinese
Â¦Bureau yesterday for a copy of every
statement made by every alleged native
born on board ship. Â¦ These copies are
asked for in order that the District Attor
ney may prepare himself for each case be
fore it is called up by United States Com
missioner Heacock. There is no doubt
that Chief Dunn will comply with the re
quest.
Â¦ The consideration - of Chinese "native
born citizens" â¢ will be resumed therefore
upon a newer, cleaner and better basis.
The yellow "natives", will be thoroughly
and critically examined on board the ves
sel upon which they arrive. Their state
ments will be transcribed and when the
applicants come before Collector of the
Port John P. Jackson he. In obedience to
his solemn promise., will refuse to land
them.'for by landing them he v makes them
American citizens. Collector Jackson will
order them sent back to China and their
interesting attorneys will be forced to get
out writs of habeas corpus and ri-tht tno
cases In conrt before United States Com
missioner Heacock. ! â¢
It is fortunate for Collector Jackson
that he will not have to determine the
citizenship of coolie "native sona" againa:
his wishes; The decision of the Solicitor
of the Treasury does no 'more than to
compel Collector Jackson to examine
these "natives." The Collector possesses
still the absolute power to remand them
and that means simply, under the new
conditions, that he still has the power to
carry out his expressed and emphatically
avowed wishes to turn all of these "na
tive son" cases over to the courts for
linal determination.
â¢ Collector Jackson has said that the cre
ation of American native-born citizens is
altogether too serious a duty for him to
undertake/ It la better done and more
thoroughly considered in court and there
no doubt the Collector will see that it is
done. Collector Jackson has said that he
had no doubt that fraud i3 a constituent
element in the handling of "native son"
cases and that he would be extremely glad
to be' rid of the whole business. It 13 for
tunate that he can satisfy hla wish. By
remanding the Chinese "native sons' to
China after preliminary examination he
forces all Celestial "citizens" who want
to remain In the United States Into the
Federal courts.
There is still another phase of this
great question which remains unsatisfac
tory and unsettled. There are still scores
of Chinese in the detention shed on the
Mall dock, remaining there contrary to
law but as a source of great profit to the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company. How
long does Collector Jackson Intend to per
mit these Chinese to remain there? Un
der what possible construction of the law
can he under any circumstance permit a
coolie to leave the vessel except by writ
of habeas corpus when he claims to be &
"native born"? The Treasury Depart
ment has ruled that Chinese aliens may
be placed temporarily on the dock â¢when
the steamship company binds Itself to pay
$500 for the loss of every Chinese.
That Is a cheap way of landing coolies,
but does Collector Jacksonl think that
when the Treasury Department said that
Chinese aliens may be placed temporarily
on the dock it meant that coolies could
be placed for an Indefinite time on shore?
It will be Interesting to know Just how
long the Collector intends to permit these
aliens to remain on American soil.
The Coptic Is scheduled to sail
from San Francisco at 1 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. She has on
board more than 400 Chinese. Does
Collector Jackson intend to permit all of
these coolies, "native sons" and the rest
to march on shore and allow the ship to
go to sea without them? Section 9 of the
act of 1SS2 says that "no passengers shall
be allowed to land In the United States
from sÂ«uch vessel in violation of law." The
meaning of the clause seems very plain.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Corapany
charges each of its yellow boarders on
the dock 50 cents a day. The addition of
400 boarders will mean an Increase of COO
a dav or JSrtCO a month in revenue to the
Pacific Mall. Does Collector Jackson In
tend to allow the Coptic to sail without
the coolies who have not been landed by
due process of law 1
WORKING with marvelous se
crecy, the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company has for some days
been acquiring Immense real es
tate holdings within the confines of
four blocks near its present Third and
Townsend streets terminus, and it is
working to secure more, doubtless with
the intention of acquiring the four blocks
entire and perhaps other blocks adjoining.
It is the intention of the com
pany to use the land thus acquired
as a site for .the terminus of ..its
southern lines. The deal is one of first
magnitude and the account of it published
by The Call this morning will create a
sensation in the business world, and es
pecially among realty owners and dealers!
Not only must the railroad company pay
a vast sum for the various plece3 of land,
valuable as manufacturing and warehouse
sites, but r hundreds of thousands of dol
lars' worth of buildings and machinery
plants' must, be removed 'before the prop-
erty will be ready for the depot buildings,
tracks and whatever else goes to euulp
the busy passenger terminal site of a
great railroad.
So Important has the deal been consid
ered that. Collls P. Huntlngton has given
his personal attention to the details of it.
No local man has been allowed to ap
proach any of the property owners, how
ever, in the matter of buying their hold
ings. It was doubtless feared by the rail
road people that if it became known that
the Southern Pacific Company was after
this property prices would Jump to a very
high figure.
â¢ So fearful has been the president of the
Southern Pacific of the- fact that his com
pany, was after the property leaking out
that he has. not gone near the coveted
blocks in the daytime, but made an in
spection .of- them after nightfall. Hla

r-oKser.gers and *crr-w of the wrecked ves

The Iolani was sugar-laden ar.d on the
rigrit of May 8 Tjrew'f "^ a hcary rain
storm. The, rain came in squall? and at
times the lookout was unable to see. fifty
f'-*i ahead. About midnight during one of
the squalls the Argus Fuddenly loomed up
In the- darkness; bearing down on the
bark'. The pecor.d mate of the Iolani was
on watch and hailed the Argus, both ves
fr\F putting their helms hard down. It
was impossible to avoid the collision,
however, ar.d the bis: Britisher struck the
bark first cn:!<5shlps and then aft.
"I was below at the time," paid Cap
tahi McClure of the Iolani, "but the cry of
the lookout awakened me. and I peached
the deck Just as the vessels struck. After
etrlking us" the first time the shock sent
the Argus back and she struck us again,
tearing away a portion of the stern. We
at once examined the vessel, but could
I'.nd no damage except aft, and for a
Jew minutes I thought the bark was all
right. To mnke pure we examined below,
end discovered five feet of water in the
hold. The ship was sinking rapidly, too.
Ther* was no time to attempt to save
Bnything, and I ordered the boats lowered.
We manap<d to get one Into the water,
but the chiy was po low that the others
could not be launched. Into this boat the
nineteen passengers and crew Jumped,
and with all haste we rowed away from
the sinking ship. We had proceeded less
than 200 yards when with a lurch the
Iolani disappeared beneath the waves.
It was pitch dark on the ocean and the
rain fell in torrents, but fortunately for
us a long Fwell was on and we had no
trouble in keeping afloat. Just as day
broke, five hours after the collision, we
sighted the Argus and were 'picked' up.
Ours was indeed a narrow escape, and I
marvel now that no lives were lost.
â¢â¢Whr,n the collision occurred nearly all
of us were asleep be-low, but the warning
cries of the lookout awoke us and we
managed to dress and reach deck before
the crash came."
The passengers and crews of the two
vessels agree that the disaster was un
avoidable. The Iolani, being heavily
laden, minded her helm well, but the Ar
gus was light and did not come around
as well as the bark. The collision oc
curred In latitude 140 west, longitude 2S
north. The damage to the Argus Is not
great.
It is probable an Investigation will be
held at once. The passengers of the
Iolani were Mr. and Mrs. G. C. Wood

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.is a new. and better republic than the world has
ever known and that thÂ« doctrines of Jefferson
and Lincoln may be re-established and made
eternal. In the face of nil the dangers to
which the country In exposed it is the patriotic
duty of all lovers of home and country, all
Â¦who cherish justice and freedom to unite In
one heroic effort to preserve our institutions
from death. There Is no room for quarreling
over. minor Issues or party names; the solemn
duty of the hour Is united, harmonious and
patriotic action, and while. I do not seek to
anticipate the result of this convention I feel
safe ln saying tliat in Mr. Hryan we shall find
a. standard bearer who will remain in support
of our principles and whose fidelity can be
trusted in any trial that may arise.
Governor Leo was given close attention
and was frequently interrupted by ap
plause, -a reference to the "splendid hero
ism of the South African republics" bring
ing a burst of cheers. His allusion to W.
J. Bryan, however, tho first time his
name had been pronounced, brought the
delegates to their feet in a hurricane ot
cheers and waving of flags, some enthu
siastic delegates climbing on their chairs
to voice their approval. Â¦
When the Governor sat down, a Jvansas
delegate proposed three cheers for the
Governor of South Dakota, and they were
given with a will.
Senator Butler responded for the con
vention. Speaking of the middle-of-the
road Populists, he said:'
They went again to the meeting of the com
mittee at Lincoln determined beforehand to
bolt, and falling to find an excuse, they bolted
again anyway. But one member of the na
tional convention committee voted and only
two or three who held proxies, and of thege
two or three were men who had already bolted
in fact by supporting the Barker and Donnelly
rump ticket. These holters. however, are few
in number, but. like the Irishman's frog, they
make noise enough for a million.
Issues to Be Met.
Speaking of the work that confronts the
party, the Senator said:
To-day we are facing another national cam
paign. Pinee 1895 the trusts and .monopolies
have Increased and multiplied ln number and
manifold power. The national banks have
Iven given greater power to innate and con
tract our circulating medium, and thus make
prices unstable and speculate upon the. pro
ducts of a great nation of seventy millions of
people. The specter of monarchy and Im
perialism has doflantly raised Its head to defy
the goddess of liberty in the highest executive
and legislative halls. Three parties are ready
to join hands to call a halt, to demand a
change, and to make one eupreme effort to
restore* the republic to the fundamental prin
ciples laid down by the forefathers.
The People's party national convention is the
first of three ln the field. We stand ready now
to do everything In our power to unltÂ« three
parties into a common fight for tho constitu
tion, for country and for humanity; we stand
ready to put country above party and do what
ever patriotism demands > and honor will per
mit to win a victory for the people and for
the republic. I feel that every delegate In this
convention indorses this sentiment. I know
you do. How to accomplish this result la not
for me to dictate. I can trust it to your wis
dom and patriotism.
At the conclusion of hlsaddress Chair
man Butler in a Phort speech introduced
the temporary chairman of the conven
tion, P. M. Ringdal. of Minnesota. Mr.
Ringdal received a vociferous welcome
from the convention, the Minnesota dele
gation In particular distinguishing itself
by lusty cheers and blasts of tin horns.
After Ringdal had spoken there were
cries of "Pettigrew, Pettigrew." but the
Senator, who sat upon the platform, did
not respond.
The temporary secretaries announced
It is conceded that the Sioux Falls convention will nominate William J.
Bryan as its candidate for President. The chief interest in the balloting
hangs on the question, Shall or shall not the convention nominate a candidate
for Vice President? The majority of those in favor of such nomination are
backing Mr. Towne for the office, and his nomination, from present Indica
tions, seems assured, if a ballot is taken. Those qpposed to a ballot desire to
leave the matter of the Vice Presidential nomination In abeyance and place the
matter in the hands of a committee, with power to go to the regular Demo
cratic convention in Kansas City, July 4, and accept its nominee for the Vice
Presidency, provided such nominee Is ln accord with the principles andyplat
form of the Sioux Falls Populist Convention. Yesterday the Minnesota/dele
gation, after a lengthy discussion, voted to stand by Towne and to place him
In nomination before the convention. Senator Pettigrew was present and
urged this course. The South Dakota delegation at its meeting decided to
support Towne for Vice President.

west. There were also occasional "whis
kers," but even these seem to havo
thinned out in the party. All told it was
a well-dressed, good-mannered and thor
oughly well behaved assemblage. By no
means the least noticeable characteristic
of the gathering was the presence of a
number of women. Colorado lod the list
in this respect, three being present from
that State. They were given front seats.
Kansas, Idaho and tho District of Colum
bia also sent women delegates, who took
their seats as if accustomed to participat

too. that while the fair delegates were
treated by the men with the deference due
their sex, they were received as a matter
of course, showing that Populists are ac
customed to the presence of' women in
their political meetings. ;
It should be stated that Sioux Falls is
proving entirely equal to the demand of
entertaining the convention. There has
been no great crowding at the hotels. ,
owing to the fact that private residences
have been opened to visitors, and in all
other respects the welfare of. the stran
gers is properly looked after. '
Two Noisy Delegations.
It was but a few minutes after 2 o'clock
when Chairman Butler of the National
Committee, attended by Secretary E. D.
Kdgerton of Colorado and George F.
Washburn of Massachusetts, stepped upon
the platform. The delegates and alter
nates had been filing steadily. into the hall.
All the delegations entered. quietly, with
the exception of those from Minnesota
and Nebraska, both of Â¦ which evoked
much applause as they, came marching
down the aisles. The Minnesota men car
ried banners and a largo shield upon
which was inscribed "Bryan and Towne."
A large number of the delegates carried
tin horns and made their presence mani
fest by ear-splitting toots.
The Nebraska men, by all "odds the
largest delegation in the convention,.hav
ing all the alternates present, came in
close upon the heels of the-- Minnesota
men. They also carried flags and waved
them vigorously as they entered; Their
arrival was greeted with cheers; â¢Â¦
After the band of the Fifty-first Iowa
Infantry, which occupied a stand at .the
west end of the tent, had rendered a,pa
triotic selection Chairman Butler- ad
vanced to the edge of his -table, and
brought down his gavel once, twice, three

"Before entering upon the regular busi

prayer by Bishop O'Gorman." Â¦ - Â¦
The Bishop read his invocation, > which
was short, well expressed and appropri

standing throughout the lnvocatton. called
upon Secretary Edgerton to read the call
for the convention. "When Secretary ' Ed
gerton had" concluded the reading- the
band played a medley of patriotic airs.
"The Red, White and Blue." "Yankee
Doodle," "Dixie" and "The Star-spangled
Banner" were received each in turn with
wild enthusiasm.
Governor Lee's Greeting.
After a song by the Mlnnehaha Club, a
local organization.. Senator Butler* intro
duced Governor Lee of South Dakota,
who on behalf of his State welcomed. the
convention to South Dakota. In closing
he said:
The struggle which commences here to-day
will be momentous. l*?t us hope that its out
come will be of: vast benefit to. the American
people. Let us pray that concealed ln its body
The chair suggested that the conven
tion might well occupy the time until the
dinner hour in listening to speeches. This
suggestion found great favor and there
were loud calls for Ignatius Donnelly of
Minnesota. Mr. Donnelly edged his way
'toward -the 'stage.* When he reached the
footlights he was seized and lifted to the
stage, where 'he was greeted with con
tinued cheers. Mr. Donnelly felicitated
Donnelly Eebukes Treachery.
Chairman Deaver delivered his formal
address to the delegates. His remarks
were loudly applauded throughout.
National Secretary Joel Parker then
read the call for the convention. Parker
was received with tumultuous applause.
He. prefaced the reading with a few re
marks on the work of the National Com
mittee following the disruption In the
Populist forces at Lincoln, Nebr., on Feb
ruary, 19 last, and said:
"We have had a terrible struggle to
hold together , the honest men of the
party, but I believe we have succeeded
and the People's party is saved."
He excoriated Senator Allen and de
clared that Butler and Allen at Sioux
Falls ."cannot sell and barter the vote of
the People's party."
At the conclusion of the reading of the
call. Chairman Deaver announced that
the National Committee had recommend
ed the selection of former Congressman
"W. M. Howard of Alabama for tempor
ary chairman. The convention unani
mously ratified the recommendation.
National Chairman D. Clem Deaver
called the convention to order at 1:30
p. m. He introduced Mayor Tafel. who
welcomed the delegates to Cincinnati.
When Chairman Deaver rapped for or
der there were on the floor or the opera
house 470 men and women, occupying del
egate seats. In the galleries a count of
noses revealed the presence of % seventy
five persons. ' s- v,.^. â¢ *
Only Seventy-Five Spectators.
From the resolutions committee's prog
ressâand It was still in session at mid
nightâIt appeared that the declaration of
principles to be placed before the coun
try will be of such a nature as to practi
cally establish anew the greenback ques
tion. That plank probably will call for an
unlimited issue of "Government paper
currency." Silver Is likely to be dropped.
The other leading planks-will demand di
rect legislation and Government owner
ship of railroads and telegraphs.
To-night it appeared almost certain that
former Congressman Howard of Alabama
would head the ticket. His probable mate
is problematical. National ! Chairman
Deaver has declined to accept the nomi
nation for the "Vice Presidency, and it pos
sibly will go to Donnelly. The latter ap
pears perfectly content to abide by the
wishes of the convention.
At the evening session permanent organ
ization was effected by the selection of
Colonel W. L. Peck of Georgia for chair
man and former Governor Waite of Colo
rado for vice chairman. Wharton Barker
of Pennsylvania, whose Presidential boom
appears to have been effectually punc
tured, addressed the convention. He
spoke on motion of Mr. Donnelly. The
convention adjourned until 8 o'clock to
morrow morning. It Is the intention to
wind up' business to-morrow without tak
ing a recess.
CINCINNATI, May 5.â The Middle-of
the-Road Populist National Convention
was called to order at Rohinson's -Opera
house at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon. Com
mittees were appointed and retired to
their halls. Ignatius Donnelly delivered
an impassioned address, in which he de
clared that middle-of-the-roaders must
stand together and save mankind.

Colonel W. L. Peek then addressed tho
convention as Its permanent chairman.
At 11:10 o'clock the convention adjourned
until 8 a. m.
which Is solid for Howard, divided on this
vote, because It favors Milton Park of
Texas for chairman of tlje national com
mittee.
The minority report was declared adopt
ed, Sfi7 to 353. The vote was disputed and
verified, when it was announced , to be
ayes SS7. noes 393. and the majority report
was then adopted. The Texas delegation,

' On calling the convention to order at
8 pm. Chairman Howard referred to the
trouble at Sioux Falls over the division
of the spoils. A delegate from Missouri
pointed to the big "16 to 1" placard and
moved that the corpse be removed from
the hall. This led to a discussion on that
issue which was shut off by calling upon
A. G. Burkhard, candidate for Governor
of Indiana, for a. speech. He was followed
by Wharton Barker, who discussed the
trusts. Like other speakers, he favored
Government ownership and the control of
everything that got beyond the range of
competition. He opposed expansion and
especially the retention of the Philippines.
When it came to balloting, the result
was disputed nmld great disorder and ver
ified amid renewed disorder on amend
ments as well as on the main question.
The report was amended by a votft of 3S3
to 281. so that the delegates present could
cast the full quota for their respective
States and was then adopted. This was
regarded as an anti-Barker vote.
The report on rules and order of busi
ness, as adopted, provides for assembling
at 8 a, m. to-morrow and remaining in
continuous session till its work is com
pleted.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion reported ln favor of Colonel W. L.
Peek of Georgia for permanent chairman
and former Governor D. H. â¢ Waite of
Colorado for vice chairman, with a long
list of secretaries and sergeants-atrarms.
A minority report was offered to substi
tute the name of Judge S. AV. Williams
of Vincennes. Ind.. instead of that of W^
L. Peek. Tho3e favoring Barker for the
head of the ticket favored Peek and those
favoring Howard voted for, Williams, al
though the lines were strictly drawn in
all States.
The most "important committees, which
went immediately to work, included the
following delegates:
Committees at Work.
After the applause had subsided there
were vociferous cheers for Wharton Bar
ker of Pennsylvania. Mr. Barker arose
and expressed the opinion that the con
vention should proceed to business, and
added that he would speak later. The
motion was then, at 4:05 p. m., carried for
a recess until 8 p. m.
Mr. Donnelly then reviewed the repeal of
the Sherman act and declared that at the
next election following that repeal the
Democratic party was on the way to the
boneyard. The Populists gained immense
strength in many States. Then, he de
clared, was the game of the Democrats
sprung to steal the Populist platform and
save itself from destruction. He de
nounced Bryan and lauded Hon. Thomas
C Watson, but declared that the Demo
crats of 1896 refused to recognize the Pop
ulists, whom they only wanted for their
2,000,000 votes. Said he:
They threw away a golden opportunity and
I want to tell you Mr. Bryan was nearer the
Presidency in ISSfi than he ever will be again.
The spirit of 1S92 Is here and all we have
to do is renew the agitation and build up the
reople'n party; to *a\-e the republic and save
mankind. Lot us say to one another; "Let
us save mankind." We are a combination of
the best blood; we are JefTersontan IVmocrats
and Abe Lincoln Republicans. (Great ap
plause.)
Mr. Donnelly concluded:
I feel that this Is the rebirth of the Peo
ple's party, with the vermin scraped off.
the National Committee on its success ln
bringing together such a body of dele
gates, saying:
There is not a fuslonlst ln the whole gang.
The Lord has separated the sheep from the
froats. and the exuviae are all gathered at
Sioux Falls. The future success of mankind
hinges on this movement of ours.
He reviewed the history of the People's
party movements .The census of 1S90. he
declared. wa3 the cause for the formation
of the party. That census, .he declared, re
vealed the fact that three-one-hundredths
of 1 p"er cent of the people owned one
fifth of the wealth of this republic. That
census, he said, resulted in the first con
vention of the People's party at Cincin
nati in 1S91. But. he declared, the Omaha
convention of 1S92 nominated a man and
gave him prominence, which only enabled
him to sell out his friends, and, he ex
claimed:
The traitors are now assembled at Sioux
Fall* in obsequious servility to the Demo
cratic party. They are parting their coattails
and Inviting the Democrats to kick them, and
every time they are kicked they thank. God
and take courage.
The audience was a representative Amer
ican gathering. Presumably nine-tenths
of the delegates and a larger percentage
of the visitors were from, the Northern
Mississippi Valley States. Thin circum
stance served to give the convention a
Western hue, but as other sections of the
country were also represented the West
was not allowed to monopolize the ap
pearances ln the convention hall.
Few of the picturesque characters of
the St. Louis convention of 1891 were pres
ent, but there were some broad-brimmed
Western Men'in Evidence.
The weather was ideal in all respects.
There were probably 500 delegates in their
seats and surrounding them was a fringe
of alternates and visitors numbering 600
to Sf"O. Seats had be<?n provided for a much
larger number, but the attendance did not
appear meager, and it may be remarked
that what was lost In attendance was
compensated for in enthusiasm. From the
arrival of tho Minnesota delegation bear
ing Bryan and Tpwne banners there were
outbursts of applause at every convenient
opening and upon the least provocation.
I'nited States Senators Butler, Allen and
Hoitfeld received liberal greeting, while
Senator Pettigrew was overwhelmed' by
the cordiality of the welcome accorded to
him. There was also generous. applause
when the name of Mr. Bryan was men
tioned by the speakers of the day. Many
sentiments were cheered to tho echo, and
this notably the case with Governor Lee's
reference to the BoÂ«rs and the Filipinos.
Good music was furnished by the band of
the Fifty-first Iowa Regiment.
SIOUX FALLS, S. D.. May ?.â The
national convention of the People's
party began business at 2:20 o'clock
to-day in the big tent wigwam on
the top of the hill on the western
side of the city of Sioux Falls. There have
been larger crowds in attendance upon
national conventions and possibly there
have been questions upon which more en
thusiasm has been manifested, but there
have been few similar events which have
been marked by more evident sincerity of
purpose or more pronounced decorum of
behavior.
The big tent was arrayed in full dress
attire for the reception and entertainment
of its guests, and the structure proved in
every way equal to the service required |
, of it. The interior of the tent was madÂ«
| resplendent by a lavish display ot.the na 7 j
tional colors. The platform was liberally
decorated with the stars and stripes and
the uprights of this structure bore aloft
excellent black and white portraits of
Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and
Bryan.
The accommodations for delegates, for
distinguished guests, for the press and for
ordinary visitors proved exceptionally
goodâ equal to those of most conventions
i held in buildings of more permanent char
1 acter. A floor was laid over the space as
j signed to the delegates and comfortable
I seats were assigned to all in attendance.
With the closing of the cap on the Coast
road iho direct traffic Into the city from
the south will be greatly augmented, and
the present cramped quarters at Third and
Townscnd streets will not accommodate
it. The company will now doubtless build
a double track on the line of Its old sur
vey through the Potrero and along the
bay shore, and abandon its Mission tracks.

The committee on platform of the Pop
ulist convention met at 7 o'clock and at
midnight was still in session, debating the
various planks presented. Ex-Congress
man Jerry Simpson acted as chairman of
the committee Among the planks acted
upon before midnight were those relating
to imperialism, militarism, trusts and the
finances. The financial plank declares for
the free coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1. The declaration on the Idaho
troubles, which was drawn by Senator
Heitfeld. is as follows:
Thomas M. Patterson of Colorado was

after a session lasting over two hours.' J.
H. Curren of Kansas, I^erf Vincent of

clamation. Several names were consid
ered before the final selection was made.
General James B. Weaver of Iowa and
Senator Marion Butler of North Carolina
were among those urged for the place.
Senator Pettigrew's name was presented,
but was withdrawn. Senator Pettigrew

storm of disapproval and it was declared

ly to singing and music by. the Flfty-nrst
Iowa Regiment band. When Temporary
Chairman Ringdal called the convention
to order at 8:40 p. m. it was announced
that the committee on credentials, resolu

not ready to report. Cries of â¢â¢Pettlgrew.
"Jerry Simpson" and " 'Cyclone Da\ Is â
"Speech! speech!" at once went up; but
none of those gentlemen appeared.
"Senator 'Pettigrew is suffering from
throat trouble and wishes to be excused,
announced Chairman Ringdal; "and Mr.
Davis will speak here to-morrow hight.
Chairman Ringdal then introduced Rev.
Mr. Hatch of Iowa, who, he said, has
some songs of his own production. The
minister, who "is blind, sang two songs,
which were received with wild cheering.
Following the singing the Fifty-first Iowa
Regiment band played a medley of oper
atic and other airs.
The convention then adjourned until 9

BAKTA ROSA. May 9.â The public hear
ing- In the matter of the charges preferred
against County Physician M. M. Shearer
by Miss Anna Pohlmann and Miss Bertha
Eunfiall, former employes of the hospital,
wherein the doctor was charged with im
proper and Immoral conduct, took place
before the Board of Supervisors this aft
ernoon, and after the testimony had been
heard the physician was exonerated.
Dr. Shearer made a lengthy statement
denying absolutely the charges made
against him and casting some very broad
reflections upon several persons who have
been prominent in the affair.
Ccn Shea, the well-known capitalist,
â¢was the first witness called. He testified
that upon an occasion he had visited Dr.
Shearer's office in this city In the evening.
Finding the front door open he wandered
in and 6at down. The door leading to
the back office was open, and Dr. Shearer
and illss Pohlmann were ecgaged in con
versation. Miss Pohlmann was crying
end begging the doctor to "take me back."
To this the physician replied that he
could not do bo. as she had been insubor
dinate as well as untruthful, and the dis
charge ti-as lor cause. In view of the
fact that Miss Pohlmann claims in her
affidavit that phe resigned to escape
Shearer's attentions. Shea's testimony
was considered very Important.
A statement was read from Miss Mc-
Afee, the present matron, to the effect
that Dr. Shearer's demeanor toward her
had always been that of a gentleman.
Mr. Wagner, an inmate of the hospital,
testlflod that MIfs Pohimann consumed
considerable liquor and he also cast other
reflections upon her character. County
Clerk Somers B. Fulton testified that
while in Dr. Shearer's office one Sunday
evening Miss Pohlmann came In consid
erably under the influence of liquor. Upon
t beirg- asked where she was going, she re
plied that ehe had Intended froing to Mr.
ciastor.'s church, but thought "perhaps
the had better not." At the conclusion
of Mr. Fulton's testimony Dr. Shearer
elated that he believed he had introduced
sufficient evidence to show that the
Ftatcmects contained in the charges
placed ag-alcst him were entitled to very
little credence. Chairman Glynn, there
upon, asked if any one else had anything
to say. After a few moments of silence
Supervisor Joseph A. McMinn moved that
the matter be taken under advisement
ar.d. the motion being carried, the crowd
left the hall.
Shortly before adjourning this evening
the natter was called up on motion of
Mr. McMinn, and a resolution was Intro
duced fully exonerating the doctor from
the charges made against him, all the
members of the board voting aye with

SMALDEElh May 8.â General Hutton
attempted to Belze a Boer v convoy that
was crossing the Zand River yesterday.
He advanced toward the river with
mounted infantry. Including the Cana
dians. A long line of wagons was plainly
visible. On becoming aware of General
Hutton's object the Boers stopped their
retreat and opened fire wtih ten guns.
They seemed In force and threatened Hut
ton's flank. Presently mounted Boers
were seen crossing the dry bed of the
river. They circled to the right and be
gran to enfilade the West Australians,
while many of the British were hit by
Boer shells.
The position became serious. The Boers
sent up reinforcements, placing the Aus
tralians in danger of being cut off. There
upon General Hutton ordered a retire
ment to Welgelegen, where he had left
his own convoy. A portion of 'the forces
advanced and engaged the Boers to cover
this retirement,, which was successfully
accomplished. The Boers continued to
shell the retiring troops, but Bhowed no
desire to press the attack further.
Meanwhile the Boers' trains steamed
away northward, blowing up the culverts
as they went.
TO REOPEN THE Â§X
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
neuvered four field guns skillfully to check
Hamilton's advance. On one occasion they
masked their position so well as to
Jeopardize the British convoy, which was
saved by the timely arival of the High
land brigade with naval guns.
The advance on Winburs was so rapid
that Hamilton's advance scouts were
overlapping the* town before Botha'g
transport was clear, but owing to the
difficulties at the drifts the guns arrived
too late to effect -the convoy's capture.
While the British captain, Balfour, was
negotiating with the Landrost for the
surrender of, Winburg General Botha him
self, misunderstanding the envoy's lan
guago, threatened to shoot him. but the
Landrost rightly Interpreting the words
and perceiving that the British were In a
position to bombard the town, decided, to
surrender. General Botha then retired.
The town contained a large stock of am
nunltlon and grain.
It is impossible to say whether the
Boera will "dispute the passage of the
Zand River seriously, but it is known that
Botha has ten guns in front of Hamilton
and that General Delarey has six in front
of the main advance.

THABA NCHTT, May 9.â The Boers have moved their headquarters in this district from Lady
brand to Clocolan. They occupy strong positions at Megathlings Nek.
The" British., including- General Brabant, are scattered among a number of strategical points,
severing the country line from Winburg to Ladybrand.
LONDON. May 10, 4:15 a. m.â General
Hutton's mounted infantry brigade,
including the Canadians, with a
part of General French's cavalry,
croesed the Zand River Tuesday
and began to work its way cautiously
along the railway northward in the track'
of the retiring Boers.
About S000 horsemen were probably en
gaged in this advance. General Hutton.
before he was Joined by a part of. General
French's force, had a sharp fight. This
was on Monday, when he reached the
river and saw the Boer convoys on the
other side and pressed forward, intending
to cross and capture them. The Boers,
however, opened fire from eight to ten
guns, forded the river above and below,
seemingly in thousands, and sought to en
velop the British. General Hutton fell
back several miles, the Boers following
until other British cavalry reinforced
Hutton. During the night the Boers re
treated, not further contesting the cross
ing.
Lord Roberts, according to one corre
spondent, left Smaldeel Tuesday to con
sult one of the Hamlltons, fifteen miles
distant.
The Boer attack on General Hutton does
not indicate any such panicky conditions
as have been alleged to exist among them.
Nevertheless, the British advance rolls on
steadily. General Broadwood and General
Bruce Hamilton have penetrated fifteen
miles beyond Winburg.
According to Boer advices sharp skirm
ishes are of daily occurrence and there
was a brisk rifle engagement outside Win
burg- on Saturday.
From Boer sources comes also the re
port that In a skirmish outside Mafeklng
on May 5 Colonel Baden-Powell was
slightly worsted.
The Transvaal Volksraad adopted reso
lutions on Tuesday expressing indignation
at the British for not conducting the war
In a civilized manner, for killing wounded
Boers with lances, for using armed Kaf
firs under British officers and for ill treats
ing prisoners.
President Kruger, after his formal
speech on Monday, said the British were
prepared for war In 1S96. as documents
which the burghers had captured showed,
but that the Transvaal, to avoid blood
shed, provided a seven years' franchise
and then a five years' franchise.
"Great Britain still demanded," he de
clared, "and the republic at length ac
cepted the challenge. Even should the
British enter the Transvaal and take Pre
toria, the Boers will still remain a free
people. Our trust is in God, and we may
be confident that he will defeat the most
powerful generals."
Adelbert Hay, United States Consul at
Pretoria, was present when this speech
was delivered. The Raad continues in
secret session.
A dispatch, credited to a semi-official
source In Pretoria, says: "The European
powers have delivered a.' collective note to
President Kruger informing him that they
will hold him personally responsible for
the safety of the mines and will support
England in enforcing compensation in the
event of' their destruction."

LONDON, May 10.â A dispatch to the

POLICY TO PREVENT
GUERRILLA FIGHTING
CAPE TOWN, May 9.â It is believed,
here that on the arrival of the British at
the Vaal Rlv^r a proclamation was Issued
annexing the Free State to the dominion
of the Queen and demonstrating, the de
termination of her Majesty's forces to as
sert British supremacy over the annexed
territory. . .
Tho Boer losses at Brandfort are now
reported to have been much heavier than
was at first understood. After -the bat
tle British patrols visited the. farm
houses in the surrounding district and all
the men were taken prisoners, while the
horses and guns were removed.
Lord Roberta is thus adopting a sterner
policy, with a view of prerventinff guerrilla

are now commandeered ''and farmhouses
where guns are found are destroyed, while
the men are arrested.

QUESTION OF
ARMOR PLATE
CONSIDERED
Senate Debate Hinges on
Plan for Government
Factory.
WASHINGTON. May 9.â Practically the
entire session of the Senate to-day was
devoted to tho section of the naval appro
priation bill relating to armor and arma
ment. The debate largely hinged on the
proposition that the Government should
erect an armor plant of its own. Senator
Tillman presented an amendment limiting
the price to be paid for armor to $300 per
ton, and providing, al30, that the Gov
ernment should erect a plant of Its own.
Senators Tillman, Money and Chandler
advocated the erection of a plant, while
Hale supported the committee amendment
providing for a plant in the contingency
that armor could not be produced for 5443
per ton. No action was taken on the
proposition, the bill going over until to
morrow.
Hale said that for the armor of 1837, $412
per ton was paid.
"As it was seen," continued Hale, "that
we had ships which needed armor, the
companies raised their price to $345 per
ton."
Hale said that it was the opinion of the
committee that the Government could get
better armor from private concerns than
it could make Itself, and avoid any of the
possible attendant scandals. Still, if the
companies declined to accept $445 a ton a
Government plant for the manufacture of
armor was to be constructed. ; He be
lieved that when the manufacturers found
that the Government was in earnest as
to the plant they would accept the price
offered.
"Have the armor makers taken advan
tage of the Government's necessity?" in
quired Stewart.
"Undoubtedly Â¦ they have," responded
Hale. "As soon' as they got upon their
feet financially they began to put the
knife to us."
"Then," declared Stewart, "I'd make a
good deal of a sacrifice. to teach them a
lesson."
Saving to the Government.
Tillman, who followed Hale, said If the
price asked by the manufacturers was
paid, It would cost the Government $17,
000,000, while at the price he proposed the
necessary armor . would cost only about
JS.OOu.OuO. His proposition was to build an
armor plant, no matter what : price the
manufacturers proposed to supply the ar
mor. Tillman said he was not convinced
that the new process armor was one whit
better than the old kind. A 9-Inch new
process plate had been easily penetrated,
and who could say that a 14-inch plate
would not suffer similarly?
Hale Interrupted to state that the/only
significance of the recent experiments was
to show that the best projectile will pierce
anything, but'that newproceas armor has
an impenetrability of 25 per cent 'greater
than any other. The cap projectiles went
through the 9-inch and even the 11-inch
plates as though they were pine boards.
Perkins of California Joined Hale and
Tillman in an animated discussion of pa
triotism in connection' with- the proposal
for a Government armor, factory.
Money said he would support the propo
sition of Tillman for a Government armor
plant, believing it the . best way to â¢ solve
the problem. Chandler earnestly advo
cated the amendment , of Tillman. He
ventured the assertion . that the: United
States could builu an armor plant and
manufacture armor cheaper than It could
be made by the private' concerns, and we
would not : have to pay. royalty to ' any
body. The bill was laid : aside Â¦. for the
day.

BOERS BOLDLY ATTACK
GENERAL HUTTON'S FORCE
If once the feeling could be propagated that
It Is the duty of every able-bodied Englishman
to make himself competent to meet an Invader
we would have a defensive force which would
make the chances of an assailant so bad that
no assailant would appear.
The speech was greeted with loud ap
plause.
After a resolution urging British sub
jects to prepare In tlme3 of peace so as
to be ready to play their part in time of
Imperial emergency had been carried by
acclamation the meeting adjourned.
In every case In history the great maritime
power has been paralyzed â killed, not by dis
asters suffered in its provinces, but by a blow
directed- at the heart. The British .navy, of
course, ought to be sufficient. But are we wise
In placing all our eggs in one basket?
As to land defense, so far as I can nee, any
thing in the nature of conscription Is not a
remedy the country is prepared to accept.
Therefore we must Induce the people to volun
tarily put themselves in a position to defend
their homes and country. The Primrose League
can do much to foster the creation of rifle
clubs.
The Premier then urged the necessity
of precaution in time, remarking that the
material for military aggression was
yearly increasing In power and efficiency
in every one of the great nations, adding:
. I urn .nervous at using language of such a
kind lest It Ehould be thought I am Indicating
that something Is known to the Foreign Of flee by
pointing out this, possible dancer. But I wish
most emphatically to say I have no Idea of that
kind. That state of affairs, as I know It and so
far as the Government is concerned, Is peace
ful. It is Impossible to speak too highly of the
careful, calm neutrality which has been ob
served by all Â¦ the, governments of the world.
A certain section of their subjects, not, I hope,
& very lance, though a noisy one, has at tne
present -moment a great prejudice against this
country. It does not, however, follow that we
have no precautions to take. Governments may
came and go and feeling may change from
year to year. That root of bitterness against
England, which I am unable to explain, may
bo mere caprice to satisfy the exigencies of
Journalists to-day, or it may Indicate a deep
seated feeling which later we may have to
reckon with. Thwe can be no security nor
confidence In' the feeling- or sympathy of other
nations I except ! through the efficiency of our
own defenses Â¦ and the strength of our own
right arm. -â¢Â¦Everywhere' the power of defense
la increasing, "and who^knows bat all these
thinss may be united in one great wave to
dash upon our shores?
Hereafter external affairs Â¦will occupy a con
siderably larger place among- the problems we
have .to solve. Not necessarily because In
themselves they are more Important, but If
we look around we can see the elements and
causes of menace and peril slowly accumulat
ing, and they may accumulate to such a point
as to require our earnest and most active ef
forts to repel them. Â¦
Mr. Gladstone.' In an evil moment for the
fame of the country and for his party, attached
himself to the Idea of the separation of Eng
land and Ireland. No one can say the home
rule cause presents any element of sanguine
anticipation for the future. I am assured that
there is no hope of the predominant party ever
giving to' Ireland practical independence. We
have learned something from the South African
warâ how that disloyal government. In spite. of
warnings, could accumulate armaments against
the most powerful combatant' and thus secure
a terrible advantage. w*e now know better than
we did ten years ago what a risk it would be
If we gave a disloyal government In Ireland the
power <of , accumulating forces against this
country.
Lord Salisbury in the course of his ad
dress commented on the remarkable
change which had taken place In the lat
ter.half of the century* in the views of thtÂ»
people , regarding the empire. They for
merly repelled it, he said, as a burden,
and that doctrine was carried to such ex
tremes by a man of splendid Genius, Glad
stone, that it produced a strong reaction,
which started after the disaster of Majuba
Hill and the death of General Gordon. The
death of Gordon, he continued, had'-been
avenged. Perhaps It was too soon to say
the great humiliation of Majuba had been
effaced or that the great wrong had been
righted,. but they felt they were on the
road to accomplish that end. Under the
brilliant guidance of Lord Roberts 200,000
soldiers, a larger army than had ever be
fore been Â¦ sent across the samo expanse
of sea, were now engaged in reducing to
the obedlency to the Queen those terri
tories which ought never to have been re
leased and to restoring to South Africa
the only chance It had of peace, develop
ment and tranquillity.
The Premier next referred to the diffi
cult and Intricate Irish problem and said:

The first tragedy In connection with the
strike occurred to-night. At 9 o'clock a
Suburban car en route to the company's
sheds In the western part of the city was
passing a Baptist sanitarium, and a num
ber of men gathered in the grounds of the
Institution threw rocks at the car. Some
one on the car fired a shot at the crowd,
the bullet finding lodgment in the breast
of Frank Lebrecht. The wounded man
attempted to enter the sanitarium, but fell
dead on reaching the door.
Â¦ One story is that a police officer on the
car tired the shot. Dan Donovan was
placed under arrest by the police, charged
with firing the fatal bullet. Donovan is

A dynamite cartridge exploded under a
car on the Meramec Highlands division
of the Suburban line with great force at
an early hour this morning. The force of
the explosion splintered the track, broke
off a section of one wheel and cracked the
axle. The car was occupied by a dozen
workmen of the company. Succeeding the
explosion a number of snots were flred in
quick succession, but the persons who did
the firing were not seen owing to the
darkness and nobody on the car was
struck by a bullet.
A proclamation from Mayor Zelgennelm
calling upon the people to preserve order
and avoid gathering on the streets was
Issued this afternoon.
The most important development of the
day was a meeting of prominent citizens
at the Mayor's office in the morning.
After assuring Mayor Zeigenhelm of their
hearty co-operation in all he might do to
prevent trouble and secure a settlement
the gentlemen proceeded to the Four
Courts, where the Police Board was in
session. The same representations were
made to the board and the delegation
asked that efforts be made to preserve
order. They were assured that the board
was doing all in its power.
The police for the first time since the
strike began showed some appreciation
of the situation and by dispersing the
crowds prevented a repetition of the riot
ous demonstrations of the previous day.
The streets were tilled with people, many
of them bearing small placards on their
hats and coats expressing sympathy with
the strikers, but they were not allowed to
congregate.
At the close of the day of armed Inac
tivity both sides expressed full confidence
in the outcome. The strikers accepted tht>
abandoned car tracks and silent power
houses as an Indication that the companj
was weakening. Frequent conferences
were held by the leaders of both sides ami
an air of secrecy prevailed around the two
quarters.
Far from relieving the. situation, how
ever, this demonstration had no further
effect than to show that by massing their
forces" on a single line the police could
keep that line open.
ST. LOUIS, May 9.â The second day of
the great street railway strike was not
marked by the turbulence and rioting- of.
yesterday, though the day closed with a
tragedy, one man being shot by em

In . this ; . connection it was- pointed out
that there was really no secret about the
soft-nosed projectile, as the Navy Depart
ment, has been experimenting with the
projectile for years. - Later in the day -a
communication was submitted to the Sen
ate by Mr. Hale from the Bureau of Ord
ance of the Navy Department in which
was described minutely the. effect of the
projectile in question upon various klnd3
of armor." > It was shown that the projec

âcarrying? no " explosive â¢ charge. â¢> would
pierce the best of armor, when the condi
tions of ; the tests were,; perfect in every
way, but only, in such condition.
.After some brief discussion It was de
cided, Inasmuch as the salient facts had
been published.. that the armor-plate mat
ter might as '.well be considered in open
session.. " -x â¢"..Â¦â¢
After the galleries had been cleared Till
man reiterated substantially the state
ment concerning the Indian Head tests of
armor plate which he had made yester
day. He pointed out the effectiveness of
the projectile tipped with a polntof soft
steel against the armor tested and used
that fact as an argument against the pay
ment by the Government of what he term
ed monopolistic prices for armor." He
dwelt upon the vulnerability of the best
known armorâ Including the Krupp armor
âagainst the projectile. He arraigned the
Navy Department for making public yes
terday the details of the armor test with
the pinch gun In which one of the soft
nosed projectiles pierced the plate almost
as if it were oak, declaring his belief that
the test had been mado public for the ef
fect it might have upon the Senate debate
on the pending bill.
Chandler felt that the Navy Depart
ment had not dealt frankly with the Sen
ate In respect to the Information. regard
ing the tests. v

subject briefly, deprecating the evident in
ability of the Senate to keep' its secrets

Jeffries and Corbett each did a lot of
work at their training quarters to-day.
'It was the last real hard exercise they
"Bob" Stoll of the New York Athletic
Club was selected as timekeeper for the
bout. When the big fellows enter the ring
Jeffries will occupy the corner used by
him when he won the championship from
Fitzsimmons. Corbett will have the cor
ner which Fitzsimmons and Sharkey
used.
"Yes," Considine paid, "if you will make
the bet read ten rounds Instead of fif
teen."
When the referee question had been set
tled Brady announced that he had $10,000
to wager on the champion, and of this
sum $3000 belonged to Jeffries. Brady of
fered to bet $5000 at even money that Jef
fries would win inside of fifteen rounds.

NEW YORK, May 9.â "Charley"

weight championship battle be
tween Jeffries and Corbett in the
arena of the Seaside Sporting Club
at Coney Island on Friday night. White
was chosen at a meeting between George
Considine, representing Corbett, and Wil
liam A. Brady, appearing for Jeffries.
Brady informed Considlne that Jeffries
objected to "Sam" Austin officiating as
referee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"Corbett." ho said. "Is a hundred per
cent better man to-day than he ever was
in his life. He is stronger and quicker
with his hands and feet than at any time
since he fought Jackson In San Francisco.
"Eddie" Burke Is a strong Corbett man
and will likely bet considerable money on
"Pompadour Jim" at the ringside. Ac
cording, to Burke's ideas.. Corbett is
stronger and cleverer than ever. ! B. O.
Pearsall entertains the same view, of the
battle as Burke and thinks that Corbett
will not only go the limit but will out
point Jeffries as well. John Considlne is
positive that Corbett will win back the
championship from Jeffries. He has
placed quite a few bets on "Jim" at good
odds.
Corbett Has Admirers.
"Jimmy" Cnlville of Boston is an en
thusiastic Jeffries man. "Billy" Hayes
fancies Jeffries' chances and wants to bet
$5000 against $2500 that the champion will
take Corbett'e measure. John L. Sullivan
tips Jeffries as the winner. Sullivan Bays
that Jeffries is in every way Corbett's su
perior.
"Corbett's friends may think that the
former champion la once again In good
fighting form," said he. "but they are de
ceiving themselves. I will bet $10,000
against $5000 that Jeffries beats Corbett.
I will also bet $4000 against $5000 that Jef
fries scores a knockout within twelve
rounds; $2000 against $10,000 that Jeffries
puts Corbett to sleep within five rounds."
Opinions of well-known sporting men
on the outcome of the battle are Interest
ing. "Honest" John Kelly picks Jeffries
aa a sure winner.
will take for the battle. Corbett will
leave his training quarters early on Fri
day morning and go to a Coney Island
road house, where he will remain until
the bell rings for the contest to begin.
Jeffries will come up on Friday morning
and in the afternoon will attend a mati
nee at one of the vaudeville houses and
after dinner will leave for Coney Island.
He will give the sports of the country an
other surprise when he meets Jeffries on
Friday night."

Mayor Phelan Writes an Opsn Letter,
in Which Ho' Threatens to Use
PowÂ«r Vested in Him by
Charter.
The article published In last Sunday's
Call to the effect that Auditor Wells had
made up his mind to refuse to submit to
any arbitrary proceeding on the part of
the Civil Service Commission has caused
considerable comment among the officials
in the City Hall. Mr. Wells said yester
day that he had been correctly quoted In
this paper and that he proposes to stand
by his expressed purpose to select his own
clerks. He reiterated his Intention . that
at the, first sign made by the commission
or Mayor Phelan to Interfere with the
administration of his office he would take
the matter to court and restrain them
from any high-handed action.
When Wells was Informed yesterday
that it was rumored that the Mayor had
threatened to remove him as he had done
Recorder Gpdchaux the Auditor smiled
and said that "threatening" and "remov
ing" were two different propositions.
"I am fully prepared to defend my po
sition In this matter." said Mr. . Wells,
"and I mean to test the reputed power of
the Civil Service Commission to dictate
my appointments, and I will further test
the alleged right of the Mayor to act
summarily with any. city official who Is
desirous that the subject of civil service,
on the legality of which some of our
greatest legal minds have expressed grave
doubts, be ' fully passed upon by the
courts." . . . â¢. r: . ... - Â¦ â¢

- AT ST. PAUL'S
The Auditor has stated informally that he
would prefer to appoint his own clerks; but the
charter, which creates his office, does not allow
All the clerks In the Auditor's office are un
der the civil service except the Deputy Auditor,
who is the personal appointment of the Auditor,
and the charter declares that any appointment
not made in conformity with the civil service
provisions "shall be void." (Section 2. art.
XIII.) Therefore any clerks appointed by the
Auditor not in conformity with the charter will
not. receive their pay from the Treasurer.
In the matter of the dispute with the Auditor
concerning the municipal civil service I desire
to make this statement: The Auditor has had
no communication with the Civil Service Com
missioners nor with me, and the Civil Service

will act with Wells exactly the same as
he did with Godchaux to compel him to
coroply with the civil service provisions
of the charter. The Mayor says that the
matter has not come up officially as yet.
but he prepared a lengthy circular on the
subject which explains his attitude In the
following language:
In conclusion, the Auditor, first, must set
authority from the Mayor and Supervisors to
employ extra clerks, which they will grant:
secondly, he would be required to take them
from the eligible Hat If It were ready, but
as It Is not ready, the Civil Service Commis
sioners can. and no doubt will, approve of h!s
appointees for a period not exceedir^t sixty
days: third, when the eligible list for clerks
is ready the Auditor will have to take them
from that list, otherwise h!s appointments
shall be void.
Section 23. article XVI. reads: "'When any
officer, board or department shall require ad
ditional deputies, clerks or employes, appli
cation shall be made to the Mayor therefor.
and upon such application the Mayor shall
make Investigation as to the necessity for such
additional assistance, and if he find the same
necessary he may recommend to ths Super
visors to authorize the appointment of such>
additional deputies, etc, subject to provisions
of prttcle XIII." which Is the civil service ar
ticle.
There is nothing in the contention of thÂ»
Auditor that the duties are Imposed upon him
by the State and that, therefore, he is In
dependent of the charter. The Auditor is a
purely municipal officer, as ilccided in Kahn
vs. Sutro. The Treasurer. Supervisors. As
sessor and other officers perform duties for
the State, but are. nevertheless, subject to the
charter.
Tho Auditor will require about twenty clerks
for ten days, beginning May M. The charter
says j(ch. 2, sec. 2. art. IV) "he may employ
such extra number of clerks during the time
their services may be necessary for the law
ful discharge of hid official duties as the Board
ot Supervisors may designate."
The Civil Service Commissioners informed me
to-day that they will give their approval to
the Auditor for ten days, so that ends thÂ»
question for the present. When the Civil Ser
vice Commissioners have held their examina
tions of course the Auditor, In common with
other officials, will have to take hla clerks from

porary appointments to remain in force not ex
ceeding sixty days, and only until regular ap

ticle can be made."
"To prevent the stoppage of public business.
or to meet extraordinary exigencies, the head
of any department or office may, with the
On investigation I find that there Is nothing
In the attitude of the Auditor which brings
the matter up at all. He Is required by the
Political Code (sections 3753-3763), on the third
Monday In May. which la the 21st. to prepare
a certain statement for the Controller of the
State, and Is given ten days In which to do
it. Now as the Civil Service Commissioners do
not hold their examination for clerks until the
2.*th of May. as advertised In the official organ,
there will be no eligible list. Therefore the
Auditor's appointees on the 21st of May will
not be civil service men. This Is done under
the civil service provision, which reads as fol
lows:
I have had no communication with Auditor
Wells, and when Interviewed last night merely
ftated, after expressing surprise, that If the
facts were the same as In the case of Recorder
Godchaux I would pursue the same course. In
that case I, In a written communication, re
quested the Civil Service Commission to report
to me the facts, and I promised to use whatever
power was given me by the charter to uphoM
the civil service provisions; nor did I Jo this
till I first consulted the Board of Supervisors,
because It Is they who try an elected officer,
who may be Impeached by the Mayor.
The duties of his clerks are of such a nature
that there Is no reason why the Civil Service
Commissioners," through free competitive exam
ination*, cannot give him entire satisfaction.
He asks for clerks, and when they are certified
to him he makes his selections and they are
then put upon probation lor six months, and at
any time during that period he may complain
of the unfltness of a clerk and, with the consent
of the Commissioners, dismiss him and apply
for another.
Under the old system the clerk received his
position as p. political reward; but under the
new system he receives It because he Is quali
fied, and hence public officers stand a much
better ehance of Betting competent clerks than
they did before, and the only way ef proving
this is for gentlemen elected under the charter
and pledged In Its support to now abide by Its
provisions.

Colonel Marceau has kidnaped his little
boy Theo Jr. and Is speeding away with
him toward the Eastern metropolis. Mrs.
Marceau, prostrated with grief, lies toss-
Ing en a bed of pain, praying for a sight
of that beautiful baby boy that a cruel
father has stolen from her.
Word of the colonel's flight from the
State, taking with him his little son, first
came from Los Angeles. On Monday
evening Marceau. accompanied by little
Theo, slipped quietly away by the Owl
train, reaching Los Angeles the following
Monday. On his arrival in the southern
city the doughty colonel repaired to his
gallery on Spring street. A few moments
later Theo Jr. was taken away by an
unknown man. At 10 o'clock Marceau
and his clerk wont to the Santa Fe up
town ticket office and purchased tickets,
after which Marceau entered a cab and
was driven to the Santa Fe depot. The
boy was on hand and soon the colonel
and his little son were steaming away.
After the Issuance on Monday of the
writ of habeas corpus commanding the
production of baby Theo in court, the
Sheriff made an effort to serve the same
upon Colonel Marceau. but without avail.
It was evident that he was attempting
to evade the process of court, and in ac
cordance with the usual procedure in such
cases Mrs. Fiske-Marceau-Fennell made
affidavit that to the best of her informa
tion- and belief he was evading the pro
cess with the object in view of fleeing
from the custody of the court. Upon the
filing of this affidavit Judge Dunne issued
a bench warrant commanding his arrest
for the offense of evading the process of
court, and It Is this warrant which Mar
ceau has evaded in his flight from the
State.
An effort to locate Marceau will be
made to-day and at any hour ne may
reach some station and find an Arizona
posse, warrant In hand, ready to receive
and hold him until legal process can be
perfected to compel his return to this
city. A criminal charge of kidnaping will
In all probability be lodged against Col
onel Marceau to-day. Marceau Is doubt
less of the opinion that as Judj?e Troutt
refused to disturb the order ratifying the
agreement by which he obtained the cus
tody of baby Theo he Is still the legal
custodian of the child, but on, this point
the lawyers differ. Attorney Boardman,
who represents Mrs. FIske-Marceau-Fen
nell. has filed an appeal from the order
ratifying the agreement, and in law the
power and effect of the agreement are
nullified until this appeal has been finally,
adjudicated. On this theorv tho effort to
stop Colonel Marceau in his flight will
be made. If he Is located a warrant will
Insure his removal from the train on
which he Is a passenger and extradition

of his troubles.

THERE was a large attendance at the
opening session of the twenty-fourth
annual convention of the California
State Homeopathic Medical Society
in the marble room of the Palace Hotel
yesterday morning. Of those present tht
majority were ladies, but all or nearly all
were doctors. The sessions will last three
days, and a programme of grfat interest,
embracing scientific and lay subjects, has
been arranged. The members from the
interior will be entertained at a banquet
by their fellow physicians whose homes
are in the cities bordering on the bay. To
morrow evening at the conclusion of the
labors of the convention a reception will
be given by Dr. James W. Ward, the re
tiring president of the society, and his
wife, Dr. Florence N. Ward, at their resi
dence, 2700 Broadway.
The first business of importance at yes
terday's session was the election of offi
cers, who will be installed at the close of
the convention. The result was in most
cases a re-election. The new officers are:
President, J. C. Kirkpatrick, M. D., L<os An

The election and preliminary matters
occupied the morning session, and it was
not until 2 p. m. that Mayor Phelan arose
and welcomed the visiting physicians to
the city. His address was responded to
by Dr. E. C. Buell of Los Angeles.
Dr. Ward, the president, then read his
annual address. It was entitled "Why Am
I a Homeopath," and was an able exposi
tion of the principles of the homeonathici
school and a plea for fairness and the ex
ercise of reason and right in their consid
eration by doubters and disbelievers. His
paper was roundly applauded, and a com
mittee consisting of Dr. George H. Mar
tin, Dr. Guy E. Manning and Dr. E. C.
Buell was appointed to consider the ad
dress and make recommendations to the
President James W. Ward, M.D., Delivering- His / nnual
Address.
society on the lines followed by Dr. Ward
in his argument.
The bureau of medical education, sta
tistics and necrology was then called on
for its portion of the programme, and Dr.
Buell opened with his paper entitled "The
Classroom and the Professor â Their Influ
ence on the Moral, Professional and Intel
lectual Life of the Medical Student. With
Particular Reference to the Mission of
Homeopathic Medical Colleges." Dr.
Buell decried the forcing process which
he said was so common in the schools, and
he dwelt on the important part the educa
tor played in shaping the after life of the
pupil. Dr. Buell was followed by Dr.
Boericke, whose paper, entitled "Home
opathy in the Homeopathic Colleges," was
on much the same lines as that of Dr.
Buell.
Dr. George H. Martin of San Francisco
followed with a paper entitled "The
Dangers of Our Public School System."
He said there was no harmony between
the schools of one county and Jhose of
another. There was no attempt to estab
lish a course of study that would be the
same all over and there was no attempt
to keep the schools throughout the State
up to the same standard. He said, too.
that the schools are overcrowded: that
studies are multiplied and recitations
piled one on the other until the pupil is
borne down under the weight of all he
has to learn. He instanced the case of a
child in the fifth grade who -has sixteen
recitations a clay, and he compared him
to a student of Yale with whom he had
spoken who had fifteen recitations a week
and thought he was working hard at that.
He advocated fewer studies and more
thorough drill in them, less home work,
smaller classes and better co-operation
among the teachers all over the State.
He paid a high compliment to the teach
ers themselves and declared that wher
ever the blame for the system lay it
surely was not with them. He argued
that if physicians by concerted effort
could enforce sanitary regulations, quar
antine laws and health restrictions and
precautions in a city he could not see
why they could not stop to do something
for the children in the schools.
Dr. H. R. Arndt of San Diego closed
the afternoon's proceedings with a talk
on "The Protecting and Elevating Effect
of Medical Legislation Upon the Medical
Profession."
At the evening session several interest-
Ing papers were read. Dr. Crawford of
San Mateo read a eulogy on Leonard
Pratt, M. D., who died during the past
year: Grant Selfrldge. M. D., read a paper
on "Acute and Chronic Mastodltis." illus
trating with lantern slides: J. M. Self
ridge. M. D.. discoursed on "Symptoma
tology, or Pathology as a Scientific Basis
for Prescribingâ Which?" and A. C. Hart.
M. D., spoke about "Stomatitis," with
lantern-slide Illustrations. Papers were
also read by Drs. George H. Martin, Guy
E. Manning. Frederick G. Canney, E. C.
Manning and A. K. Crawford.
Sailor Ziegenbein Gives Away Story
of His Fake Identification of
Alleged Footpad.
"Did you see Getz at the City Prison?"
asked Judge Mogan of Sailor Albert Zieg
enbein yesterday morning.
"Yes," replied the sailor. "A policeman
took me in there and said, 'Go along the
cells until you see a man alone in 'one
of them. That man is Getz. Take a good
look at him.' "
Barry Getz was before the court to go
through a farcical examination on the
charge of attempted highway robberv
preferred against him by Ziegenbein. In
view of the fact that a charge had been
made to the effect that Getz's arrest on
suspicion of having shot Bortzmeyer was
a piece of spite work on the part of a
police officer and that Ziegenbein had
been induced to tell the Howard-street
fairy tale against him to support that
charge, the answer created a sensation.
Judge Mogan tried to find out the name
of the police officer who had told Ziegen
bein to look at Getz. but the sailor said
he could not remember it. He could not
even give a description of the officer, he
said.
Ziegenbein told a rambling and contra
dictory tale. He was badly mixed up by
the cross-questioning of Attorneys Nap
thaly and Friedenrich, who represented
Getz.
Judge Mogan said he was Convinced the
sailor was romancing and ordered the dis
charge of Getz.
William Cronin, footpad and safe
cracker, made a good many contradictory
statements yesterday when questioned by
the police and reporters. It has been.im
possible to get any definite information
regarding his movements since the time
he escaped from the Auburn Jail. He
claimed that when he left Auburn he
went up toward Truckee and from there
toward Marysvllle. On the road to the
latter place he declared some "bum" told
him the officers were looking for a man
of his description, and he then started
for San Francisco, avoiding the towns en
route.
On the morning that Bortzmeyer was
shot. May 3, Cronin declared he must
have been on the road near Marysville.
He said he had not yet reached San Fran
cisco from Auburn.
It the police are correct, and they base
their belief on pretty strong evidence,
Cronin lies when he cays he had not
reached this city on May 3. Captain of
Detectives Seymour has evidence going
to show that Cronin and his young com
panion, now known as George DliTendorff.
broke open the safe in Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s office at San Leandro on the morn
ing of May 1. If this is so, they doubtless
came at once to this city and remained
here until the following Sunday morning,
at which time they broke open the safe
in the Benicia Postofflce.
"Where did you get money to buy food
with after your escape from the Auburn
prison?" was asked of Cronin yesterday.
"I had about $12 in my shoe when I
was jailed." was the reply. "1 came to
this city intending to take the steamer
for Portland. 1 first met the boy who is
with me last Sunday morning."
Cronin told a reporter he had never been
in Sacramento. To Captain Seymour he
said he got the bulldog pistol found, in
his possession in that city last Saturday
night. He picked it up in a room of the
Fort Wayne lodging house, he said. On
Tuesday Cronin said he spent Saturday
night in San Francisco.
Yesterday John Collins, blacksmith: J.
F. Clvne, Assistant Postmaster, and Con
stable William D. Hyde of Henlcia ailed
on Captain Seymour and Clyne identified
the bulldog pistol as the one stoltn from
the Postottlce safe at Benicia. Collins
said he saw Cronin In Benicia last Satur
day in company with a man resembling
Diffendorff.
Constable Thomas came over from San
Leandro yesterday and gave Captain
Seymour a broken drill found in the safe
thnt was opened there. This drill was
of the same size and make as the three
found on Diffendorff. They are all of
Mor.se make and 7-32 of an inch in size.
Diffendorn!, when asked about the
drills by Captain Seymour, said defiantly
that he would explain allthat iu court.
The sentencing of Cronin and Diffen
dorn* on the charges they pleaded guilty
to has been postponed to Saturday fore
noon next. It is deemed best to hold them
in the City Prison at present. Under the
name of George Degendorf the younger
man was sentenced November 19, 189S, to
serve ten days for battering W. Grand
man.
Postal Inspector Erwin will charge
Cronin and Diffendorff before the Federal
Grand Jury Friday with having robbed
the Benicia Postofttce.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The State Fair needs no defense; it will continue
to be held at some point of this State which will
properly maintain and appreciate it. That Sacra
mento is such a place we feel assured. :, : - '.'->
In 1890 her enterprising citizens by their aid to it
made the State Fair of that year one of the greatest
in its' history, and extended its fame all over the West.
We believe that they will do so again; that they ap
preciate every influence which works for their ad
vancement, and that by their support of that insti
tution they .will not indorse the expressions of a
journal which misrepresents the true sentiments of its
city. ... . _ ,
Roberts has thus far made no attempt to overcome
the Boers, but as he manages to get round them very
rapidly, his tactics may be just as effective as over-
It is going to be a serious question whether the
Belgian Hare Club will admit bald-headed men or
whether every member must have his own hare.
The Record-Union further draws invidious com
parison between the moral complexions of the two
fairs, neglecting to place the responsibility upon the
city authorities, who control such matters, rather than
upon the fair management, which is not responsible
for it. The same authority which enforced the law
during the Street Fair can do so during the State
Fair. It would have been graceful for the Record-
Union to have given credit to the new executive and
police administrations of Sacramento for their present
good work, and have expressed reasonable confidence
that they would continue it. In the course of its ex
traordinary article the Record-Union takes occasion
to reflect upon the character of the attendance at the
State Fair. Proper denunciation of this statement
might be considered out of place here. This is a re
flection upon the management of the State Fair which
a rollcall of its directorate, past and present, suffi
ciently rebukes. The flower of California's industrial
and social citizenship has graced our great annual
State Fair by its attendance. A list of the patrons
and exhibitors of that Fair since its organization
would disclose nearly every name connected with the
romantic history and marvelous development of Cali
fornia. As a result largely of the lessons taught and
learned at its annual agricultural exhibition this State
stands at the very front of America's progressive agri
culture.
Some communities do not forget an old friend as
soon as a new one appears, some do not deem it con
sistent with a spirit of proper progress to abandon
one resource as soon as another i3 attained. We be
lieve that the Record-Union misrepresents the enter
prising people of Sacramento, and that that commun
ity can maintain both a successful Street Fair and a
State Fair, and, if necessary, a citrus fair and other
organized movements for exploiting to a wondering
world her many advantages. The recent Floral Fair
was organized by friends of the State Fair and in its
aid, and the State Association lent it every assistance
and encouragement. The two exhibitions cover differ
ent fields and exist wholly without conflict. As a source
of advantage and revenue to Sacramento they are not
to be compared. The annual appropriation of from
fifteen to twenty thousand dollars for the State Fair
made by the Legislature is largely locally distrib
uted. Many thousands of dollars are annually paid
by the State Fair management for wages of labor and
salaries of employes, which nearly all goes to Sacra
mento people, while from the stables in training at
the track of the association a revenue of many thou*
sands of dollars per month is 'derived by that city.
The advertising resulting from a State Fair and the
prestige of being the headquarters of the Agricultural
Society of the State, with the greatest possibilities in
that direction in the world, is something of which
Sacramento should not be insensible.
SACRAMENTO has just concluded a. most suc
cessful Street Fair and Trade Exhibition. It
was a credit to her enterprise and a splendid
exposition of the floral products and beauties of that
portion of the State. All California share3 her pride
in her fruits and flowers and in the soil and sunshine
from which they were produced. During the progre33
of this exhibition, when its gratifying success was
firft assured and when the time was appropriate only
for general felicitation, the Sacramento Record-
Union, with a spirit of most unbecoming exultation,
took occasion to make some most remarkable state
ments with reference to the State Fair, to which
Sacramento owes so much and which has played so
important a part in the development of our State's
resources. The Record-Union states that now Sac
ramento has discovered her independence of the State
Fair, and that she no longer desires it upon past con
dftions. That Sacramento could exist without the
State Exposition is doubtless true; she could do so
without the Street Fair, and should she be bereaved
of the State Capitol or the railroad shops the enter
prise of her people and the advantages of her loca
tion would still perpetuate her. But it does not fol
low that it would be to her advantage to lose them,
nor wise for her public journals to adopt a policy
which would jeopardize their continued maintenance.
SACRAMENTO 0ND T^E STATE FAIR.
dinance by a large majority." It then adds: 'The
passage of this measure must leave a stench in the
j nostrils of the people that Councilmen will feel keenly
| when the time comes for the retributive stroke of
i popular disapproval, and we perform not only a duty
J to the public but a generous duty to every member of
! Councils when we earnestly advise that Councils shail
; refuse to give their sanction to a measure so open and
! flagrant in violation of every principle of public in
' terest, and that must carry with it a pungent flavor
, of speculation and debauchery. It is worse than a
public blunder; it is a public crime."
The Philadelphia case is pertinent to the isÂ«ue here
because it shows the aggressive nature of telephone
corporations. In the end a comprehensive system of
State and municipal regulation will have to be es
tablished over such corporations in order to protect
public interests. _ Massachusetts is moving in the di
rection of State regulation and control. California
should follow the example. While the Tax Collector
in the courts seeks to collect from the corporation the
payment of the tax imposed upon it, the Supervisors
should take the necessary <teps for submitting to the
people an amendment to the charter giving the mu
nicipal authorities power to regulate telephone cor
porations in the same manner as other corporations
controlling public utilities are regulated. Moreover,
the matter should be taken up as a State issue, and
every candidate for legislative ofnee this fall should
be pledged to vote for State regulation. The' people
need not submit to the exactions of tax-shirking
monopolies unless they choose. It will be our own
fault if the telephone corporation continues to be able
with impunity to evade taxation and defy the law.
Some of the Supervisors object to adding the word
"men"' to horses and dogs in the proposed anti
poolroom ordinance. Perhaps the objection is based
on the ground that the clause should read "Pugs,
dogs and horses."

Why Marriage Is Declining
By
LiHie Devcreu* Blale.
a gui/iÂ» for a Republican administration and Con- !
gress. Urchanan was not a success as an- expounder
of the constitution. He could see in it a vigor and
automatic action for the protection of slavery, and hs
carried that method of construction so far as to see
nothing in the constitution to prevent the slave
holders from destroying the Union to save slavery.
As President he declared that there waa" no power in
the constitution to coerce, a slave State when it de
sired to secede from the Union. In other words, the
Chronicle's last witness regarded the constitution as
a mere convenience for the extension and defense of
slavery, and useless for any other high purpose.
The Chronicle claims to be a stalwart Republican
paper, but it' goes to a strange source for its consti
tutional doctrine and theory. Republicans will pre
fer to abide with Webster and the earlier Democratic
examples of Jefferson and Monroe.
The fact that "native-born" coolie "citizens" over,
forty years of age arÂ«Â» now recording their American
nativity at the City Hall is something of an indica
tion that while our yellow fellow citizens do not be
lieve in delay, they also do not believe that it is ever
THE TAX-SHIRKERS PT BAY.
r\ S v.-2S expcclci, the telephone corporation has.
/ A 'â¢ refused to pay the taxes which it owes to the
' city, and Tax Collector Scott has been com
pelled to resort to the courts to enforce the rights
of the municipality. It is another phase of the old
issue of the people against the tax-shirkers, the law
against those who violate it. It is an issue which can
have but one end. The law must be supreme. The
corporate monopolies may evade and dodge, and per
haps even defy the law for a while, but sooner o r
later victory must be on the side of the people, or
othcrwbc popular government will be a failure.
It is worth noting thai at this time the aggressions
of telephone companies have gone so far as to arouse
resistance in all pans of the country. We have had
occasion recently to direct attention to the action
taken to obtain redress fr.om such aggressions in
Massachusetts and in Washington City. Now come
reports of an outburst of public indignation in Phila
delphia caused by a job put up by the telephone com
panies in thnt city. It appears the corporation there
seeks to obtain the passage of an ordinance which will
place it, like the telephone corporation in this city,
well nigh outside of municipal control, and it is
charged that corrupt means have been made use of
to achieve that end.
The Philadelphia Times, in, commenting on the
subject, says: "It is an open secret that Councils have
been seen and persuaded to pass this telephone or-
The Chronicle is not fortunate in antagonizing
Webster zr.r{ Buchanan, and setting the latter up a3
sion sound in the California case. Congress acted
leisurely, under the treaty, and did not accept the
Secretary of State as authority.
The Mexican treaty was ratified in May, 1848, but
not until the 28th of September, 1850, v.ere the laws
of the United States extended to this territory by
authority of act of Congress.. Two years and four
months passed before Congress exercised its judg
ment and the discretion committed to it by treaty.
It will be c een that, even were Buchanan's conclu-
To recapitulate: The Louisiana treaty admitted the,
territory it acquired as a part of the Union of the
United State?; the Florida treaty u?ed the same lan
guage, and both invested the people living in the ac
quired territory with American citizenship. Ths
Mexicm treaty declared the territory acquired to bs
within the United States, and Mexicans therein to
he citizen?, when Congress chose to invest them.
No such clauses appear in the treaty of Paris re
garding the Philippines or their people. The terri
tory is not by that treaty integrated with the Union
of the United State 3, nor are the people invested with
citizenship, or such investment pledged to them by
Congress, as in the case of the Mexican treaty.
Buchanan put his own interpretation upon th*
status of the territory and people, and hastened to
give the Democratic construction to the automatic
action of the constitution. His views were certainly
as partisan 23 Webster's. The Democratic party, re
garding the constitution as protective of the institu
tion of slavery, hastened to extend it to all new ter
ritory, for it was controlled by the Southern slave
holders. If Webster's views are to be thrown over
because he opposed slavery, then Buchanan's views
must be thrown over also because he favored slavery.
Our treaty with Mexico recites Cart-clc XI): "Con
sidering that . * * â¢ the territories which by the
present treaty are to be comprehended within the
limits of the United States." And in article IX it
says: "Mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall
rot preserve the character of citizens of the Mexican
republic * * â¢ shall be incorporated into the
Union of the United States, and be admitted at the
proper time, to be judged of by the Congress of the
United States, to the enjoyment of ail the rights of
citizens of the United States, according to the prin
ciples of the constitution."
Treatie*, like the constitution, are the supreme law
of the land. When made for the acquisition of ter
ritory treaties determine the status of such terri
tory, and it -remains in that status until Congress
chooses to change it by substituting another.
THE Chronicle threw over Webster as an ex
pounder of the constitution en the subject or
its extension to territory acquired by treaty or
; conqccr.t. Its reason was that the Democrats of Web
t ster's time held that slavery was protected by the
; conititation. and the ?ntoniatic extension of that ftm
â¢ damer.ul instrumerit carried slavery with it. Web
| stcr vas anti-s!avery, and therefore, the Chronicle
: contends, stood for a strained interpretation of the
constitution as to new territory, for partisan reasons^
Webster had been .Secretary of State, and his views
of the cor.slitutiori have zlarays been considered au
thority. But the Chronicle abandons him and intro
duces Jimes Buchanan as authority for its contention
that by the treaty of Paris the constitution was wholly
extended and made to cover Porto Rico and the
Philippine?, converting those islands into an integral
pcrtion of the Union of the United States and making
the islanders our fellow citizen*.
Buchanan's testimony is in the form of a rather
\trb'iit letter written on October 7, 1848, a> Secre
tary of State in Polk'3 Cabinet. In this he discusses
the government <ie facto existing in California after
the treaty of peace with Mexico, and to continue
"until Congress shall provide a territorial govern
ment.*" He said: "This government de facto wiil of
course exercise no power inconsistent with the pre
visions of the constitution of the United States, which
is the supreme law of the land. For this reason no
import duties can be levied in California on articles
of growth, produce or the manufacture of the United
States, as no such duties can be imposed in any other
part of our Union on the products of California."
It wiD be observed that this was a limitation im
posed upon a de facto government.

DREAD DISEASE
Superintendent Webster Says
They Are a Menace to

He Refuses to Sign the Demand of a

baum Reinstated.
A small-sized sensation was created at
yesterday's meeting of the Board of Edu
cation when Superintendent Webster de
clared that the sanitary conditions at the
Humboldt and Agassiz primary schools
were such as to be a. constant menace to
the lives of the pupils. "
"Four children have already died from
diphtheria." said Webster, "and the par
ents are becoming very much alarmed.
I blame the Board of Health for careless
ness in not properly fumigating the two
schools and taking other measures to pre
vent the spread of the disease."
The board authorized Director Casserly
to make an immediate investigation and
to report at the next meeting.
Superintendent Webster was asked by
Casserly whether ho Intended to sign
the demand of Mme. GIffard, a special
teacher in French, whom the Board of
Examiners had reported for having an il
legal certificate. Webster tersely replied:
"Not for a while, if at all."
Casserly wanted to know the reason for
"Webster's refusal and the latter still more
tersely replied:
"That is my business, sir," and Cas
serly subsided.

cruelty on the high seas. Kseape Is a son
of La Belle France and so patriotic that
he cannot speak a word of English. He
stated his case In his own language to
Assistant United States Attorney Mar
shall B. TVoodworth, who speake French
like a restaurateur. Escape was on thÂ«
high seas several weeks ago and the sec
ond mate gave him an order in English.
"Jay nay comprong paw," replied the
sailor.
The mate grabbed an Iron belaying pin
and smote Escape on the mouth, knock-
Ing out all his front teeth.
A warrant was Issued for the arrest of

Night.
Allowed to Dock and L>and Cargo
During the Day, but Had to
Lie in the Stream at
The barkentine City of Papeete docked
at Lombard-street wharf yesterday and
both captain and crew were glad of the
chance to get ashore and stretch their
legs. One of the sailors named Thomas
Karrell was la such a hurry to get up
town that he could not wait for the cara
of the belt railroad to pass, but attempte-I
to clamber over the couplings. He fell
and broke his leg in two places and was
taken i to the Harbor Hospital for treat
ment.
The Papeete was 54 days coming to San
Francisco, one of the longest runs made
from Tahiti in years. Captain Berude
says nothing but light winds, calms and
head winds were encountered throughout
the passage. While the barkentine was
In Papeete the news of the Examiner's
plague scare reached the city and had It
not been for the fact that the merchan
dise was badly needed not an ounce of it
would have been landed. As it was, all
the Chinese goods, such as tea, rice and
matting, were taken out of the original
packages and reboxed and resacked be
fore they were allowed to land- The old
coverings were burned.
The Papeete was allowed to go along
side the wharf and discharge during the
day, but at night she was ordered into
the stream and not a soul was allowed
ashore. % Captain Berude says the Tropic
Bird and 'Galilee will discharge their
cargoes, as the merchandise is badly
needed on the islands. The Papeete will
go back again to Tahiti, but the chances
are It will be her last trip.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
The dock on the south side of Howard
street wharf is to be dredged, and that
means extra work for the City Street
Improvement- Company, which has the
contract for building the wharf- Yester
day the City Improvement Company noti
lled the Harbor Commissioners that an
extra quantity of cement would be re
quired in filling the cylinder piles, and
that the State would have to pay for the
same.
Chief Engineer Holmes reported that
work had been done to the value of $4066 CD
by the San Francisco Timber Preserving
Company, J7S6 OS by the City Street Im
provement Company, J3CS9 by Newson &
McNeil and ?266*> 25 by Andrew Wilkie Jr.
All these sums were ordered paid. Darby
Laydon & Co. were allo-wed $500 for dam
age done to Main street wharf by vessels

the structure was undergoing repairs.
Attorney General Ford informed the
board that It could go ahead and antici
pate revenue in order to build wharves
and ferry slips. Chief Engineer Holmes
submitted five different methods for build
ing four new wharves and two new ferry
slips, and the consideration of them was
laid over for a few days. The wharves
are to be built between Union and Lom
bard streets, and the ferry slips on. the
north side of Lombard street.

The Santa Fes engine was pulled up
out of the mud of the bay yesterday, but
owing to a hitch in the plans It had to be
lowered into its bed again. It will be
raised and placed on the wharf to-day.
There was a small fire on Washington

XX. GOETHE AND THE GOLDEN
AGE OF GERMAN LITKKTUKE.
(Concluded.)
BY ARTHUR H. PALMER, M. A.
Â¦ Into the labor of all the preceding pio- fl ;
neere in the new land of German lltera- tj
ture and in full sympathy with these crit
leal surveyors and guides two men of "J
surpassing genius, more purely poetic, *jj
Goethe and Schiller, now entered to com- g ;
plete the development, and by making w
Germany united in the things of the spirtt h
to lay the necessary foundation of that â¢*
united political Germany -which was not *Â£
fully realized until after 1371. These two e ,
men during the last ten years of Schiller's t !
life (1734-1SO5> were bound together in a G
friendship of most remarkable intimacy
and beauty. These years are preemi- *'
nently the period of the beginning in Ger- h
man literature of the little city of Wei- D
mar, the Athena of Germany, which in- ci
deed for about half a century prior to his T
own death in X?32 Goethe made the literary Â« s
capital of Europe. In the union of these ~
two men are focused all the previous
thought and literature of Germany, and v
from it radiate all the influences that have \\
determined tne later literature. d
Deterring for a little our appreciation or â¢â¢
Schiller and his works, let us briefly re- f
view the life, works and character of e
Goethe. This life is simple in its exter- s
nal aspects, but in its inner content c
Goethe s greatest work of art, and so rich a
as to mate any summary treatment ut- t:
terly inadequate. Very apposite is the
poet Hebbels distich on tnts life: r
Polat it is only at first, that sÂ«ntly opens as P
Which, swilt-growins, extends finally over the v
world. 5
Johann Wolfgang Goethe was born la =
1743 at Franktort-on-Main and died in InT
at Weimar. After a precocious boyhood f
in his native city he studied at the univer- '
sities of Leipzig and Strassburg. and lived
again mostly in Frankfurt until he began Â£
to reside in Weimar, in November, l..o. i
From 1.S6 to 1>J& Goethe was in Italy.
Thereafter his residence in Weimar was *
uninterrupted save by travel. Early and
long he had a large share in the admlnis- {
tration of the duchy of Weimar. t
The starting point of our appreciation in j.
outline of uoetne's life and works we may (
nnd in these few modest words which he j
once uttered to a friend: "After all. there {
are honest people up and down the world ,
who have got light from my books, and }
whoever reads them and gives himself .
the trouble to understand me will ac- t
knowledge that he has acquired thence a
certain Inward freedom." How important j
tnese plain words are is shown by the ]
comment of one of the first critics of ,
France, who says: "I should like to in-
scribe these words upon the pedestal of ,
Goethe"s statue. No juster praise could be ,
found for him. and in very truth there
cannot possibly be for any man a praise (
higher or more enviable." ,
vv'ith this Frenchman stands ths noted ]
English critic, Matthew Arnold, whose Â¦
mature Judgment is: "It Is by no means
as the greatest of poets that Goethe de- ,
serves the pride and praise of his coua- ,
trymen. It is as the clearest, the largest, .
the most helpful thinker of modern times.
Goetha is the greatest poet of modern
times not because he is one of the, half
dozen human beings who in the history of .
our race have shown the most signal gift
for poetry, but because, having a very .
considerable gift for poetry, he was at the
same time, in the width, depth and rich
ness of his criticism of life, by far our
greatest modem man."
Goethe's rank as poet or literary artist
in the narrowest sense depends upon five
' or six larger works, unlike one another.
' yet all masterpieces, and upon his lyrics,
: so rich m number and variety. These
! larger works are "Werther," that unnpv
' ellike novel, which gained to literature the
heart-life of modern man: the refined ana
' dignified poetical dramas "Iphigenia" and
1 "Tassa." whose style possesses unequalea
Â¦ grace and purity, and whose content
1 abounds in wisdom; the epic poem in hex
: ameter. "Hermann and Dorothea,' por
travine German middle class life with
', comprehensive tender truthfulness and
1 charm; the novel of culture, "Wllhelm
1 Meister." "a rich manifold life brought
close to our eyes, which has entered Into
the training of Europe," and "Faust,"
that marvelous, unique work, surely the
" greatest in all literature since Shake
r Ipeare, presenting as it does, with ful.est
' depth, power and beauty, all that
' Goethe's rare nature and experience
" could teach as to the spiritual meaning
I and end of life.
On Goethe's lyrics who shall challenge
I the judgment is which Heine and Tenny
son agree? The former thought them the
" best in the world, while Tennyson is said
? to have placed Goethe foremost among
i the moderns as a lyric poet and to have
, added when one of his hearers demurred
' and mentioned great lyrics by other
" writers: "Yes. but Goethe is consummate
: in so many different styles."
r Outside the narrow domain or pure
poetry we must place Goethe among the
I foremost scientific investigators of his age
Â» and in the front rank of critics of lltera
ture and art. He has the qualities of the
â, best essayists. -*-- : . â ,
Indeed, what perhaps above all els*
I makes him fruitful and precious to so
I many is that he is ever a sage and a
philosopher, teaching and exemplifying
I the criticism and the conduct of life, body
i ing forth a practical philosophy, the very
Â« essence and spirit of which are beauti
fully epitomized in those oft -quoted lines
I from "In Memoriam." in which Tennyson
e himself later declared that he alluded to
Goethe alone:
I hold it truth with htm who sices
S To one clear haro In divers tones.
B That men may rise on stepping stones
â Of their dead selves to hlsher things. .
XXL SCHILLER'S FAMOUS
DRAMAS.
The lif?. character and works of Schil
ler may well evoke to a peculiar degree
the sympathy and admiration of Ameri
cans. His idealism, his ardent aspiration,
his championship and achievement of ever
broader and higher freedom, his daunt
less domination of difficulty, whether
moral or physicalâ these are elements of
character and life nowhere better under
stood than In our own land.
The keynote of SeJiIller's career is lib
erty. Goethe's retrospective Judgment,
spoken years after the death of his friend,
was this: "Through all of Schiller's works
goes the idea of liberty, and this Idea as
sumed different forms j as Schiller ad
vanced In his culture arid himself became
different. In his youth It was physical
liberty that occupied him and passed over
into his poetic creations: in his later IifÂ»
idÂ«Â»al liberty. That physical liberty did
Indeed so much occupy Schiller in his
youth was in part due to the nature of
his spirit, but chiefly to the constraint he
had had to suffer In the military school.
But then in his maturer life, when he had
physical liberty enough, he went on to
the ideal, and I would almost say that
: this idea hastened his death, for he there
by made demands upon his physical na
; ture which were beyond his power to
I meet." So. too. Heine said of him:
"Schiller wrote for the preat ideals of
the revolution: he destroyed the bastile
of the Intellect: he aided in building the
temple of freedom."
" Amonsr the dramas created by Schiller
his own life might well be called not the
leastâ the tragedy of the spirit In con
flict with the material elements of earthly
life, slain apparently In mid-care*>r. yet
living on into immortal triumph. But the
narrow limits tf the stace here at our
disposal forbid the presentation of this
drama, nor can we portray Schiller, the
lyric poet, the historian, the critic, the
philosopher. The literary dramatist alone
shall occupy us. and w* may here only
note that he was born November 10, 1739.
at Marbach. in Wurtemberg, and died.
March 9. 1S05. in Weimar.
Schiller's earliest play was published In
17S1; his death prevented the completion
of his "Demetriu?." Those of his dramas
that may be called preat number nine or
eleven, according as we count "Wallen
stein" â in form a trilogy â one or three.
Now these twenty-five years and nine
dramas fall naturally Into two distinct
! periods or grroups. separated by about a
decade given mainly to study and writing
of history and philosophy.
The first group comprises the three
prose dramasâ "The Robbers" (1781),
"Ffesco" <trT>. "Love and Cabal" (17M)
and one in iambic blank verse. "Don Car
los" (1TS7). The pro^e dramas all breathe
that spirit of rebellion against establish
ed order and social conveations which was
not only favored by general despotic con
ditions, but kindled 1nt<Â» a consuming
flame by Schiller's personal experience of
tyrannv.
"The* Robbers*' is first not only in time
but also in rank. It is the tragedy of
personality in conflict with law. the In
dividual with civilization, which he re
gards as based on wrongr alone until. madÂ»
wise by experience, he resigns himself tiÂ»
his fate in submission to law. So excel
lent is the technical dramatic skill, so
many-sided are the characters, so fu!l and
fiery !s the diction, that the first review
er could not refrain from exclaiming of
the author: "If we are ever to expect a
German Shakespeare It is h?."
"The Conspiracy of Fiesco In Genoa" !a
the least successful of the early plays,
although of Interest as being the first
historical drama written by Schiller, an-1
both more moderate in diction and of
compacter structure than "The Robbers."
The theme r>t this "republican tragred;. "
is the political revolution attempted by
a nobleman of Genoa in the sixteenth, cen
tury.
The indictment of the tyranny and
wickedness of many petty Gorman prince
ly courts, which in "Fiesco" is half hid
den under the Italian veil, is made in
"Love and Cabal" with tremendous
frankness. This tragedy of middle-class
existence that la crushed by the cruel
selfishness of the hurhrr classes Is so
charged with elemental life and passion
as to make the chords of. popular emo
tion vibrate In sympathy.
"Don Carlos" mark* transition In many
respects; from despairing satire of the
present to confident hope in the future,
from poetry to history, from prose to
verse. Many poets have dramatized the
strange history of this son of PhiLp II of
pain.
Schiller's drama la Interesting and in
parts very beautiful. Its weakness lies
in its lack of unity, due to the author's
own development during the long five
years between its inception and comple
tion. The earlier portion of the drama iÂ».
in Schiller's" original intention, "a. family
picture of a roval house â the situation of
a father who is the unhappy rival of his
sonâ of a son who loves without hope and
is sacrificed.' 1 But in the larer portion
this is essentially lost trom sight, and thÂ«
hero is the Mar'iuls Posa, an embodiment
of all the faith, in man and the social
ideals of the eighteenth century. This
fine, inspiring tigure. many passages of
stateliest beauty, and the happy use o.
iambic blank verse, melodious and im
pressive, impart extraordinary vitality to
thU work, great though imperfect.
The second group of Schiller's drama,
his noblest creations, all bat one primar
ily historical in subject and written m
verse, were published in the years from
175y to IS05. One of the few really great
tragedies of modern times is the ftr3t of
these. "Wallenstetn: a Dramatic Poem.
In content and spirit this i3 one lor.sj
drama, though having thÂ© form of a tru
ogy made up of a one-act prelude. \\ al
lenaletn's Camp." and two nve-act plays,
"The Piccolomlnl" and "Wallenstein Â¦Â»
Death." Within a smarter frame than
that of this grandest national drama or
Germany it would scarcely be possible to
present not only the tragedy of the great
man's character and fall, but also the
struggle and the triumphs of the whole
thirty vears' war. Of this work Tleck

stage of all Schiller's plays. Since it a
main theme 13 the moral elevation of tn*
heroine by her life experience, the author
deviates from exact historical truth in
brightening her character and dark<Â»r.insr
that of Elizabeth. This drama is hi?hl>
pathetic, abounding in passages of lofty
thought and intense passion powerfully

ler now turned to France, producing a
romantic tragedy with a medieval subject
containing miracles and idyllic elements.
His "Maid of Orleans" (lsul> is a highly
poetical creation, written with much lyric
fervor The charm and power of purity in
woman, the Inspiration drawn from re
ligion and patriotism, are presented in
strong theatrical situations with language
noble and full of feeling. .
A unique exception amon? the works we
are considering is "The Bride of Messina

the poet's imagination, not historical; the

Warner's Safe Cure Is a scientific vege-
table preparation for the restoring to health
of tired-out kidneys and overworked livers.
When these great organs are In health there
can fee no Impure blood, headaches or con-
stipation. Men cannot Improve on nature,
hence It Is emuslng to read of medicines
which claim to "remove Impurities from the
blood"â "The kidneys enrich and vitalize
the blood," etc- The kidneys. liver and
lungs purify the blood and they alone.
Neither medicine nor man can do It. War-
ner's Safe Cure, by helping nature. Is an
aid, an assistantâ simply that and nothing
more. The twentieth century man or
woman ts a reasoning, sensible person and
seldom deceived by mlsstatements.

A r ftt ( York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. May 9.â There was further
large liquidation of storks In the market to
day and prices Â».-ere at one time from 1 to
2% points below last night for a large num
fcer cf active railroad 6tocks. Before the clone
cf the market the losses were fully retrieved
In many stocks and In not a few of those
which had been most acutely affected by the
t.-1'.ir-.R small net Rains were established The
Sate recovery was materially assisted by a
buoyant rise In Hugar to a level 5U above "last
night, and by rather positive strength In the
principal metal stocks. The appearance thus
riven was that of thÂ« competition of a spasm
of liquidation and the nubttequent covering of
belated outstanding short contracts and a buy-
In*- of stocks by careful observers who had
etood by watching for the low point of the
market to pet In. How well this appearance
:â¢ Justified by the actual conditions can only
be demonstrated by future events. That there
was a vÂ«ry powerful and skillful manipulation
In the market all day was clear from many

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, May 9.â The wheat market opened
steady, but as there was no news of particular
significance to encourage buying the price soon
began to sag for lack of support. Free de
liveries of May contracts and a continuation
of the heaviness in corn Imparted a little ad
ditional weakness. Trade was curtailed, ' how
ever, owing to the near approach of the Gov
ernment crop report and there was little effort
made to take advantage of the situation until
near the close, when a sharp break In the
price of May wheat at New York demoralized
holders of small scalp purchases which were
being carried here and those were immediately
dumped, closing the market weak within a
fraction of the bottom of the day range a
poor export demand added to the depression
July closed with a loss of M6Hc
Corn opened firm, but It began to give way
almost Immediately and declined %c from the
top price made at the opening before making
a rally. Liquidation was heavy during the
first part of the session, but active buying by
several bull houses owing to light receipts
without prospect of increase In the near future
and heavy exports caused an upturn. When
this support was withdrawn the market weak
ened again under short selling and closed near
the -bottom at a decline of %c~ for -the day
Fine crop prospects caused a decline In oats
early, but covering by shorts at the decline
steadied the market near the close. July
closed with, Boilers at 22Â»{câ a shade < lower.
Â¦An Improved cash demand and higher prices

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, May 9.â The Boston 'Wool and Cot
ton Reporter will say to-morrow: There Is no
imDrovement to be noted In the wool market,
the trade for the most part being completely
stagnant. Pending the opening of th* London
wool eales on Tuesday of this week there was
no disposition to operate. It was generally ex
pected that the sales would open at a further
decline, which expectation was realized when
on that day cables were received announcing
declines of from 5 to 10 per cent and offerings
of 29O.OCO bales. This decline has naturally in
tensified the weakness here. Aside from the
London sales the attention of the trade has
teen largely concentrated on the wool-growing
districts, where there appears to be a deadlock
between the grower and the buyer, and but
very few of the new wools have as yet been
purchased. In the local market sales have been
very small and prices unchanged.
London Wool Sales.
LONDON, May 9.â The offerings at the wool
auction sales to-day numbered 91.S73 bales and
consisted of a good selection. Competition was
more active, but prices showed no Improve
ment. The Continent was an active buyer, but
the home trade secured the bulk of the offer
ings. American purchases were small. Greasy
crossbreds were in good demand. The with

State of Trade.
The New Tcrk circular cf Henry Clews ears:

natural for gold to flow Jn that direction.
While raore will probably, follow there are no
Indications that the efflux will be sufficient to
cause ar.y Inconvenience here. Money rate*

have no better evidence of financial strength.
The trade situation shows some abatement of
the rush noticed during the paft fix months.
Borne manufacturers Â»I!1 lÂ»e occupied for two
or three months more on high-priced contracts;
but new orders are coming in more slowly.
Buyers have got over their excessive zeal
to get gor<Js, and In Rome departments of
merchandise retailer* are ' already carrying
lanre Ftockf, and w!!l probably put in their
duplicate orders with less freedom until these
are worked down to normal proportions. For
these reasons it would caua; no surprise if pen
eraJ busir.euii flowed down somewhat at first
hands. If then some nhadir.g of values should
follow new orders would probably come in more
freely. In the Iron trade most departments
erÂ» fully employed and no recessions of cor.
pequence have yet been made. The present
abnormal prices for these products cannot,
however, continue Indefinitely; and as there
are mar.y r.ew projects deferred because of the
high coet of structural materials, a lower
rar.je of values would place such Industries
on a more stable and natural basis."

' Indications. Evidently the process of liquida
tion wu largely concentrated In a few hands
and It was conducted by concerted understand
ing and with a diligent nursing of oppor
tunities. On any considerable decline the
pressure of the selling promptly relaxed and
supporting ordets were executed which over
i and over again checked the decline and drove
I efforts of the bears to cover were met by
i aggressive bidding up of prices In the Interest
of eeveral of the most prominent stocks. But
every time when prices recovered to near last
night's cloÂ«Â«e the volume of buying ord<"ts fell
off and eventually ceased. The flood of liqui
dation was thon renewed. The volume of deal
ings on the recovery was palpably much less
than that on the decline and the aggressive I
bidding up of prices showed that the object |
was rather to establish a higher level of prices
than to secure stocks on the mest advantageous j
terms. That a turning point must ultimately 1
be reached after such a period of liquidation !
and a sharp recovery must ensue makes the |
professional bears very cautious in maintain
ing opposition to any rising tendency in the !
New York market. None Of the news of the
day had any apparent effect on the movement
cf prices. Exports of gold to Paris, which
amounted to a little over I2.S0O.Cm0. proved
slightly larger than the preliminary estimates, j
The local money market showed a slightly j
hardening tendency, especially for time loans, j
which showed the possibility of an automatic I
check to the gold export movement in ca.Â«e j
of any increased need for money here. AH
of the trunk lines, the Pacifies, the Atchisons,
Missouri Pacific and Louisville were special
surferers from the liquidation. The firmness
of the 6teel stocks was doubtless due to the

London Market.
NEW YORK, May 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets were flat all round to-day,
chiefly in Westrallans. Business in Americans
was less heavy than yesterday and there was a
slightly better tone at the close. Accompanied
by the usual rumor that COCO Boers had sur
rendered, funds are still declining and the war
loan has been at only 1 3-16 premium. The
County Council discussed to-day an Issue of
Â£5.000.000. Americans opened eick, under par
ity, but rallied fractionally. New York, how
ever, came still worse, and the market closed
at the bottom. In the street It steadied for
a f^w minutes, then broke again. There were
weak spots both here and on the Continent.
The London speculation proves to have been
bigger than was thought, but there is a slight
inclination to buy on the decline.
Paris was. unsettled and sold Tlntos TÂ» down.
Anacondas sympathized and copper was er
ratic. The disparity between spot and forward
is growing. Bills were more plentiful and the
bank did a fair business In discounts. There
were no loans.

Before the body was borne into the
church the noral pieces pent by the fire
men were taken in and grouped upon the
platform. There were a great many of

James Marshal, John E. Mason, Colin M.

Enteitaiument Under Auspices of
Young Men's Institute to Help
a Woi thy Cause.
A fine entertainment was given for the
benefit of St. Joseph's Deaf Mute Home,
Oakland, at Metropolitan ' Temple last
night. A large audience was present and
the proceeds will go far to aid the lauda
ble work of a worthy institution. The
performance was under the auspices of
the Young Men's Institute, many mem
bers of which labored hard for Its suc
cess. Prominent among the features pre
sented was the part taken by the deaf
muto children In action exercises and sign
language.
Introductory remarks were made by
Very Rev. J. J. Prendergast, V. G., who
gave a brief history of the establishment
of the Institution.
"It was at the invitation of Archbishop
Rlordan," said Father Prendergast, "that
the sisters of St. Joseph came from St.
Louis to found the only Catholic institu
tion of its kind west of the Rockies. The
home has grown to its present propor
tions from a residence bequeathed by a
charitable woman for the purpose and
now there are thirty-five unfortunate
children who lack the Benses 'of speaking
and of hearing."
Father .Prendergast made an earnest
appeal for the charitable movement,
which, he said, was entitled to every con
sideration.
"The Leper's Prayer" was Interpreted
by Miss B. Durkee, and Mercedes An
titrade expressed the recitation in the sign
language. "Santa Claus" was similarly
rendered by A. Georgle. The junior class
gave an exhibition of school work by
signs and answered questions in various
studies. "Nearer, My God. to Thee," sung
by L. Lobe, was expressed In signs by
Marguerite Galloup. The "Star Spangled
Banner" was sung by L. Lobe and the
lips of the singer were read by Miss Hat
tie Hensley. "School Work" by the se
nior class proved highly interesting.
An Introduced specialty by Miss Erma
Valrvllle was exceptionally well done and
earned an encore. The rest of the pro
gramme follows:
"The Rule of Life," Miss Vlbiana Mc-
Kay: "'A Dream" and "Take Me, Jamie

with color yesterday on the occa
sion of the twenty-ninth annual
picnic and reunion of the Retail Grocers'
Association. Fully 3000 people filled the
picturesque grounds during the day. They
came on three double-section trains, with
lunch baskets filled with good things.
There was not a hitch in the interesting
programme of games and not an incident
occurred to mar the pleasures of the day.
As usual with a week-day outing, the
rough element was conspicuous by its ab
sence. Efficient committees worked ener
getically to make every one contented and
happy, and in this they were successful.
Von der Mehden's brass band played en
livening music in the big pavilion and
throughout the day it was crowded with
dancers. The games, target shooting,
bowling, guessing contests and numerous
other pastimes were patronized ' by all
present. Prizes to the number of 627 were
distributed. The children were given
enough candy to start a small-sized store.
The races 'were highly exciting and
aroused loud applause. Every kind of a
race, from a fat man's event to a run
backward, was on the card. There was
a tug-of-war between the married and
single men. and as usual the benedicts
were victorious. The prize winners in the
various events are as follows:

Business Transacted at the Subsidi
ary High Court of the Ancient
Order of Foresters.
At the morning session of the Subsidiary
High Court of the Ancient Order of For
esters yesterday a resolution having for
its purpose the taking away from the
committee on laws of the power of chang
ing the intent of any amendments offered
bv any court was adopted.
*A great deal of time was taken up in
the discussion of the proposition to cre
ate a general relief fund intended to as
sist courts and members in distress. After
discussion it was discovered that the plan
was too cumbersome, so the whole mat
ter was recommitted in order that the
plan be prppared to meet the numerous
objections that were presented.
H. Beaver. C. E. Hallie. W. A. Claus
and "\V. F. Jones, appointed at the pre
vious session of the Subsidiary High
Court to revise and amend the general
laws, presented a report, which, after a
prolonged discussion, was rejected on the
ground that amendments to the laws
must come from subordinate courts and
not from any committee.
A great portion of the afternoon was ae
voted to the written and the unwritten
work of the order. ,
It is possible that the election will be
held this afternoon, that is. if the propo
sition to create a fund for the purpose of
extending the work of the order does not
provoke too long a discussion. If that
should be the case, the election will be
held on Friday.
It is proposed that the delegates shall
to-morrow enjoy a boat ride along the
water front and possibly as far as v a-
Uu.t evening there was a grand ball in
the Mechanics' Pavilion, which was taste
fully decorated. Ther* were several thou
sand people in attendance.

SKELETON OF KERR
IS FOUND AT LAST
couver Park Over a Year
Blew Himself to Pieces in Van-
VANCOUVER. B. C. May 9.â The dis
covery of a shattered skeleton with
broken legs in Vancouver's park has un
earthed the secret of a shocking suicide
of a year ago. In April, 1S99. Harry Kerr.
an Englishman, was drilling and blasting
rock at English Bay. a bathing resort,
close to the park. He was very despond
ent owing to his having contracted an in
curable disease, and said several times
that he would kill himself.
He was sent one day to this city for
blasting powder and was never seen
again. His clothing was identified to-day
by his former chums, Chris Miller and
J. Bell. The position of the remains Indi
cates beyond doubt that Kerr sat on the
blasting powder and ignited it. The
trunk was In one place and the broken
legs and hips two paces away. The dis
covery was made by a young lady who
was picking ferns in an unfrequented
part of the park.

GRAPE-NUTS.
Starchy food is absolutely essential to
the bnrasa body. Its best form is
shown in the food "Grape-Nuts." where
the starch is changed into grape sugar
during the process of its manufacture.
In this way the required food is present-
ed to The system in a predigested form
and is immediately made into blood and
tissue, without taxing the digestive or-
gans.
A remarkable reÂ«ult in nourishment is
gained; the person using Grape-Nuts
gains quickly in physical and mental
strength. Why in mental? Because the
food contains delicate particles of Phos-
phate of Potash obtained from the
grains. This unites with the albumen
of all food and the combination is what
nature uses to rebuild wornout cells in
the brain. This is a scientific fact that
can be easily proven by ten days' use of
Grape-Nuts. - Never eat beyond three
or four heaping teaspoonfuls at a meal.
On the other hand, too j?reat con-
sumption of partly cooked, starchy oats
and wheat, or bread, pastry, etc.. pro-
duces i-erious bowel troubles, because
the bowel digestive organs (where
starch should be digested) are overtaxed
and the food ferments, producing j?ast
and ir.krobes generate in the decayed
food, frequently bringing on peritonitis
and appendicitis.
The arguments on food are interest-
ing. Many persons adopt a vegetarian
diet on the ground that they do not like
to feel that life has been taken to feed
them, nor do they fancy the thought of
eating dead meat.

Attorney A. S. Newburg, who has a
certain practice in tho Police courts, pro
poses to institute quo warranto proceed
ings In the Superior Court to oust Chief of
Police Sullivan from office on the ground
tnat, according to the charter provisions,
he was too old to be appointed Chief of
Police. Many Kngllsh and American de
cisions seem to give force to the attor
ney's interpretation of the charter. Upon
these Newburg is preparing an elaborate
brief, which he will offer in support of
the petition he Bays he will file. .
Under article VIII of the charter, creat
ing the Police Department and explaining
its duties,- section 1 of chapter I reads as
follows: "The Police Department shall
consist of a' Board of Police Commission
ers, a Chief of Police, a police force anil
of such clerks and employes as shall be
necessary to carry into effect the provis
ions of this article." Section 3 of the
same chapter provides that "Every ap
pointee to the department shall not be
less than 21 nor more than 35 years of
age, etc."
Attorney Newburg assumes that the
word "department" is used In the same
sense in ooth sections, so that the age
limit of appointees applies to the Chief of
Police of the department as much as to
tne members of nis force. Chief Sullivan
was 43 years old at the time of his ap
pointment, if the records are correct, and
therefore, from Attorney Newburg's point
of view, was ineligible to the omce. By
similar reasoning tne Police Commission
ers tnemÂ«eives are In danger of removal.
The case will stand or fail upon the way
in which the court interprets the meaning
of the term "department." Black on "In
terpretations of Laws" says that "Where
tne same language is used repeatedly in a
statute in the same connection, it Is pre
sumed to bear the same meaning through
out the act." Black further-says upon the
same subject: "If the language of the
statute is plain and free from ambiguity,
and expresses a single,' definite and sensi
ble meaning, that the meaning Is pre
sumed conclusively to be the meaning
which the Legislature intended to convey.
In other words, the statute must be In
terpreted literally. Even though the
court should be convinced that some other
meaning was really intended by -the law
itnaklng power, ana even though the lit
eral interpretation should defeat the very
purposes of the enactment, still the ex
plicit declaration of the Legislature Is tho
law, and the courts must not depart
from it." Â¦
Attorney Newburg has a number of de
cisions from Kngllsh and American re
ports bearing on tne same matter and. he
says that he has been unable thus far to
find any that oppose the views expressed
by Black. \ In Woodbury vs. Berry; 18
Ohio State, the court says: "We are sat
isfied by. considerations outside .of . the
language that the Legislature intended to
enact something very different from what
it did enact, but it did not carry out its
intention, and we cannot take the will 'for
the deed. It Is our legitimate tunction to
interpret legislation, but not to supply Its
omissions." Â¦ : Â¦â¢ â¢
' There are many cases In the California
decisions- that bear directly upon this
point. Notable among them is that of
Judge Wallace, in 41 Cal.*, 147. in which
he says: "Questions, too, which regard
the mere policy of the statute, inquiries
as to whether it is in itself a wise law;
whetner its anticipated operation will be
to promote or to retard the true prosper
ity-of; the people, are not for us to con
sider; â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢ except we overleap the bar
riers by which the limits of our rightful
authority are plainly denned."
Attorney Newburg admits that all
through the article. creating and defining
the duties of the police the words "depart
ment", and /'force"' are used indiscrimi
nately, .but contends that the use of tho
words in the opening, chapter must deter
mine their use in the Â¦ remainder of th<?
article,; and that- there can be no mistak
ing the fact that the word "department."
as used there. Includes the Commission
ers, Chief, policemen and clerical force.
According to his view the Commissioners
might be ousted from office for the same
reasonâ because they were appointed after
they had passed the acre limit.
The method of procedure in getting tlv?
matter into the courts will be. to secure
the ' permission of the Attorney General
to file a petition in the name of the State
against Chief Sullivan, charging that he
Is unrightfully in the office. The Chief will
then have to prove -that there is nothing
in the charges, the burden of proof falling
upon him. â¢

Making Preparations to Establish ah
Industrial Department for
the Orphans.
At the morning session of the California
Assembly of the Rebekahs yesterday
there was on interesting address by Grand
Representative Drew on the advancement
of women. He went back to the time
when women were suffered to attend
church meetings, but were not permitted
to utter a word. He then spoke of the
progress that women have made in the
past quarter of the century, saying:
"Why, they are In almost every associa
tion now, and woman even seeks to run
the government of the United Statesâ and
she will if George Dewey is elected."
Mr. Williams of Brooklyn Lodge pre
sented to the assembly a fine set of
gavels. In addition the assembly re
ceived a check for $100 from the jubilee
committee, it being part of the surplus.
This amount is to be expended for the or
phans' home.
A considerable portion of the 'day was
spent in the discussion of a plan to es
tablish an industrial department at the
home, the same to be maintained by vol
untarv contributions. During the discus
sion there were a number of contributions
from lodges, through their representa
tives, for the purpose named. In a short
time $100 was placed on the secretary's
desk.
Tlrrje is also a proposition to establish
a hospital ward at the home, which will
require an outlay of $10JO.
Last nipht the ritualistic work of the
order was exemplified by a team from
Oriental Lodge in Memorial Hall . of the
Odd l'ellows' building.
An association of past presidents of the
assembly, of which there are now eight,
was formed for the purpose of keeping
In touch with each other in the

REBEKAHS IN STATE
ASSEMBLY SESSION
ODD FELLOWS DISCUSS
THE THERMALITO HOME
An Executive Session of the Grand
Lodge â Degrees Conferred, by
Three Teams.
At 15 o'clock yesterday morning the
Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of
Odd Fellows assembled, and after hearing
tne Journal retul went into executive ses
eicn for the purpose of considering the re
port of the grand master, so far as it
applied to the home at Thermalito. The
discussion took a wide range. The speak
ers were: E. Brunner, G. L.. Johnson. G.
H. Morrison. Grand Master Bonynge. J.
Crosbin. L.. L. Alexander. M. T. Moses,
a. F. Jones and others. At adjournment
no conclusion had been reached.
In the evening there was an exemplifi
cation of the Initiatory degree by a team
from Los Angeles Lodge. This was fol
lowed by the conferring of the first de
gree by a team from California Lodge cf
this city, and then of the second dejrv<-e
bv a team from Harbor View Lodge of
"VVest Oakland.
the allegation Is made that the newspaper
Is Indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of
$100 for a written article on the subject,
"The Government of Our Insular Posses
sions." In November, 1S98, the defendant
offered a prize of $100 for the best essay
on the subiect mentioned. Rose-Soley
claims that his essay was the best of all
of those submitted, but the Post has re
fused to award him the prize. Rose-Soley
says he has a certain literary reputation
and that he was injured in the sum of $99
because the Post circulated the fact that
another person was entitled to the prize.
â¢ It seems as if that "raw Job" in regard
to the Howard-street wharf, now build-
Ing, would never down. A story became
current yesterday on the front that when
the committee of lumber dealers was ap
pointed to pass on the quality of the lum
ber being used in the cylinders the mem
bers were not tolu that they were to de
termine whether or not it was In accord
ance with the specifications prepared by
Chief Engineer Holmes, who had loudly
proclaimed that he wanted that point set
tled.
"Nobody asked us whether the lumber
was in accordance with tho specifica
tions," said Robert L. Taylor, manager
for Renton, Holmes & Co., and a member
of the committee, when seen yesterday.
"The only question asked us was If it
was merchantable lumber. We found
that most of It was, though about o per
cent of that on the bulkhead was totally
unfit for use. This the foreman told us
he did not Intend to use. No, we didn't
see the lumber under the water.
"The lumber used was certainly not In
accordance with the specifications. These
were drawn up In a very stup.d manner
and no one could tell just what they
meant. Contractors would probably
have thought ship planks were required.
"The fact that one firm might 'guess' "
âMr. Taylor used the word "guess" with
significant deliberation â "that cheap lum
ber could be used would certainly place
other firms wishing to bid at a disadvan
tage. Thus a great Injustice was proba
bly done in the letting of this contract.
I don't blame the contractors for being
angry and disgusted.
"In future the Harbor Commission
should have specifications drawn up
clearly and intelligibly; then there would
be no room for criticism."

Notary J. N. Turner, whose office was de
clared vacant by Governor Gage. The
deed In question was attested before Xo
tary Turner subsequent to Gage's arbi
trary action removing him, and God
chaux refused to record the same on the
ground that it was illegal. Whether or
not such is the case will be determined
in the suit now on tile.
It Is the consensus of opinion among
lawyers of this State that Gage .did not
have the right to remove at least twelve
notaries public, whose positions he de
clared forfeited. Shortly after Gage oc
casioned a stir by revoking the commis
sions of these notaries public in order to
learn as to the power of the Governor to
make such removals inquiries were made
of Attorney General Tirey L. Ford as to
the law in the matter. Mr. Ford and Dep
uty Abbott searched the statutes and
found that -prior to 1893 notaries public
were appointed for four years. The Legis
lature of 1893 amended the statutes and
omitted to fix the term for this class of
officials. In 1SS9 the law was again amend
ed, restoring the four year term. The
Attorney General summed up his conclu
sions as follows:
Section 793 of the Political Code would be
made to read: "The term of office of a notary
public is four years from and after the date
of his commission." I am therefore of the
opinion that the office of a notary public, ap
pointed after the act of 1893 went into effect
and before the act of 1899 took effect. Is held
at the pleasure of the appointing power, namely,
the Governor, and that section 1793 of the Po
litical Code does not apply to notaries public
so aDPointed, but to those only who were ap
pointed after the act of 1899 took effect.
Differing from this opinion is one sub
sequently given out by former Attorney
General Fitzgerald and this opinion is
backed by the majority of the bar. At
torney William Denman said last
evening that In his mind there
was no doubt as to the Illegal
ity of the action taken ' by Governor
Gage in arbitrarily removing the notaries
public referred to. He also said that It
was plain that no matter which way the
opinion of the court leaned it would lead
to great confusion. Some of these nota
ries public who were removed have since
the revocation of their commissions been
taking depositions, attesting deeds and
engaging In the general duties that attach
to the offices in question, while those ap
pointed to nil the vacancies have been
similarly engaged. When the opinion of
the court is nanded down the acts of one
class or the other will be decreed Invalid.
Then will come the scramble to straighten
the record of various suits and actions in
which some member of the unfortunate
or rather illegal . class has figured, and
great confusion will be the result. . â¢

DELEGATES to the Republican
State Convention will assemble at
Sacramrnto next Tuesday to se
lect four delegates at large to rep
resent California in the national conven
tion called to meet In Philadelphia June
19, UOO.
It Is Important that a man of charac.
te:r. Independence and Integrity should be
chosen for chairman of the State conven
tion. According to the provisions of the )
official call, the convention must elect a i
State Central Committee. The power of |
appointing an executive committee for
constant duty in the management of the
campaign may be delegated to the chair
man of the convention. Delegates to the !
convention, and especially those from the j
Interior, shouM be on their guard against !
committiry; llu I ill 111 Â¦ in advance to the j
Fupport of any programme candidate for ;
the chairmanship. Agents of the South- |
em Pacific's political bureau work under j
cover, but they are not always able to i
conceal traces of their work. Perhaps j
they may present to the delegates the
name of a popular man who possesses
tr.ar.y of the abilities of the Ideal presid- >
Ing officer, but the delegates should de- ]
mand more than parliamentary ekill.
It is known that the political agents of i
Herrin In San Francisco are working dili- j
freittly and with as much secrecy as pos
eible in the preparation of a programme
to control the organization of the conven
tion. It is not absolutely essential that
the chairman should rank high as a. pub
lic speaker and presiding officer. It Is
much mere essential that he should have i
â¢he firmness and integrity to cast aside
a railroad programme In the selection of
an executive committee. If the duties of
presiding over the convention should be- j
come too exacting he could call to his
assistance the ekiil of a trained man. The
chairman should be a man tried and true
â one In mhorn the votes of the party
throughout the State would have supreme
confidence. He should be placed on
sruard to protect the party from the dan
ger of corporate interference.
The Examiner has placod Moses Gunst j
In the field as a candidate for delegate i
from the Fourth Congressional District I
to the Republican national convention. A_s j
Moses Guast is a Deznocrat, the Demo
crats, perhaps, should rally to his sup- !
port. It is peculiarly appropriate that the j
Kxarriner should bring out Gunst, and so
reward the ex-Police Commissioner for
cervices rendered in advancing and pro
tecting the interests of Ksola. "When the
delegates of the Fourth Congressional i
District assemble they may decide to send j
a delegation of Republicans to the na- Â¦
tional convention.
A Republican primary election to select i
delegates to the State and district con
ventions will be held to-day in the Fourth I

The printed tickets for each Assembly
district contain the names of candidates
for the Fourth Congressional District Re
publican Convention and an Introductory
paragraph, as follows:
Vote for Congressional committee to consist
of eighteen members, to be known as tho
Fourth Congressional District Republican Com
mittee of the State of California. Said com
mittee to have full charge and control of party
aJTalrs therein, and Â¦whose term of office shall
expire upon the 1st day of July in the year
A. D. 1304. Candidates: Joseph S. Spear Jr.. P.
H. Prendergast, A. Barnard. Dr. P. A. Kear

M. Fmith, Dr. D. Lustig, Martin Brady, J. H.
Nelson, James McNair.
The Congressional district nominating
convention to be chosen at the primary
election on the second Tuesday of Augmst
next will no doubt appoint a committee,
as the law requires. The Republican vot
ers of the Fourth District may vote to
day for a committee If they see fit, but
they cannot elect a committee to serve
until 1904. or confer upon any committee
the power to manage and control party
affairs. Doubtless the plan in view is to
give the existing committee in the Fourth
another lease of life. There Is also a
scheme in the Fifth District to prolong
the life of the Congressional committee
which J. Alva Watt appointed last June.
The delegates elected to nominate candi
dates for CongTess will be competent to
select committees to conduct the cam
paign.
