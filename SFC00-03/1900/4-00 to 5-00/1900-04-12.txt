LONDON, April 11.â The War Offlcc has received the following dispatch from Lord Roberts:
"BLOEMFONTEIN, April 11.â Methuen reports that the party of Boors defeated April 5 made a good resistance
for four hours, and only gave In when our troops with fixed bayonets wer* within fifteen yards of them. Seven of thfl
enemy were killed, eleven wounded and fifty-two made prisoners.' Besides L'eutehants'Boyle and " Williams, Â¦'â¢ Sergeant
Patrick Campbell was killed and two of our men y/ere wounded. Williams was deliberately killed after the white flag
had been held up. The perpetrator of the crime was at once shot. Methuen speaks In high terms of the intelligent
manner in which the Imperial Yeomanry and the Kimberley mounted corps behaved.
"Buller reports that tho enemy attacked his right flank yesterday while he was engaged In changing his position, but our
artillery silenced their guns and they did not press the attack. Our losses were four killed and eight wounded. There is no
further news yet from Wepener." , - ,
Lord Roberts also wired to the War Office from Bloemfontein under date of Tuesday, April 10, as follows: _:,-? v
"The enemy have been very active during the past few days. One commando Is now on _the north bank of the Orange
River, not far from Aliwal North, while another is attacking Wepener. The "garrison there is holding out bravely and in
flicted serious loss on the Boers. Major Springe of the Cape Mounted Rifles was killed. No other casualties have been re
ported as yet. The troops are being moved up rapidly. A patrol of -seven men of the Seventh Dragoons, under Lieutenant
Letherby, which had been reported missing since April 7, has returned safely." . '
As the foregoing dispatch does not mention the alleged British reverse on Saturday at Meerkatsfontetn, the Boer tele
grams are not credited at the War Office, and they are further discredited on account of the discrepancies in the dispatches,
as Meerkatsfontein in one message is located near Brandfort, and in another It Is located southeast of Bloemfontein, . the
places being 100 miles apart.
BOER ATTACK UPON ELANDS LAAGTE.
LADYSMITH. Tuesday. April 10.â The Boers opened fire this morning early,
pending shells into the British camp at Elands Laagte from three different posi
tions widely separated. The shells did little damage. The troops moved out to
reconnoitcr and found the Boers in strong force and well fortified. One naval
4.7-inch gun replied to the Boers, who have again placed a long Tom In position.
When the Doers commenced shellinp the British were drilling, and one pri
vate was killed and another was wounded before the soldiers were withdrawn
from range. Then the naval brlgtde opened fire and drew a heavy Boer fusillade,
.and two of the cruiser Philomel's gunners were killed. The naval men stuck
~io their positions, however, and the Boers unmasked six guns, including a 100
pounder. ar.d shells fell in all the British camps..
After three hours' bombardment the British fire slackened and the burghers
cleared from a kopje on the right when a British shell fell on the spot occupied
by their pun. Another commando was *=een moving toward the British, appa
rently with the intention of flanking them, but the British shells forced them to
retire.
Tfrr> British advance pickets were continually sniped, but few . casualties have
been reported. In the afternoon the naval brigade again fired a few shells. It
!s rumored that a body of Boers has gathered %outhwest of Elands Laagte with
the apparent intention of cutting the British line of communication. General Clery
directed to-day's operations. General Buller visited Elands Laagte to-day.
HOPELESS CONFUSION AT MAFEKING.
LONDON. April 12.â The correspondent of the Times at Mafeklng, under date
of March 30. comments upon the "hopeless confusion and fluctuation of spirits
In the garrison as to the chances of relief sinee -Tuesday's terrible bombard
ment." and uoon the variety of rumors regarding the location of the relief
forces, rumors involving, so far as the southern column Is concerned, dlscrepa
des of 100 mile*. - ,
The Lourenzo Marques correspondent of the Times, telegraphing Wednesday,
eaytÂ»: "Epler, an Austrian financier, who Is acting as captain of the Rand mines
police, in order to frustrate the destruction of the mines, sent a remonstrance
to Pretoria against boring, with the result that State Engineer Munnik's order
for boring was canceled." ;Â¦>. * . . .
The Durban correspondent of the Standard, telegraphing Wednesday, says:
"A brigade is being cent from here to Join the main army under Lord Roberts.
It Is under command of General Hunter."
ALIWAL NORTH. Wednesday, April 11.â Lord Kitchener arrived here to-day
and left soon after. A big Boer gun was knocked over yesterday at Wepener.
The garrison Is holding its own. There has been heavy cannonading thero

SAYS MILNER BROUGHT ON THE WAR.
ROME. April 11.â The Naples correspondent of the Tribuna telegraphs an
Interview he has had with Mr. Fischer, one of the Boer peace commissioners,
who arrived there yesterday. Mr. Fischer said he was convinced that Sir Al
fred Milner, when appointed Governor of Cape Colony and .British High Com
missioner in South Africa, went to Cape Town with a fixed intention, with a
mission, to bring about the war, and this was proved by the fact that Milner
had systematically opposed the Transvaal's "generous efforts and concessions to
avoid war," as though he had received precise instructions to follow this line
of policy. â¢
"While the Transvaal was making concessions," said Mr. Fischer," "Great
EHtaln was gathering troops along the frontier." The Boer envoy accuses Sir
Alfred Milner of falsifying dispatches. In fact, according to the commissioners,
accusations against Sir Alfred Milner constitute one of the principal features In
tho prognostications which the commissioners seek'to carry- through. The Boer
envoys left Naples to-day, going by way of the St. Gothard Pass and without
stopping here.
AMBULANCE CORPS DELAYED ON SUSPICION.
LONDON. April 12.â The correspondent of the "Daily Mall at Lourenzo Â¦ Mar
ques, telegraphing on Wednesday. 6aya: "The departure of the Chicago ambu
lance corps for Pretoria was delayed on suspicion of filibustering. The members
left by special train this afternoon, accompanied by a motley following of French
and Germans, 100 in all. The departure only occurred after many. stormy Inter
views with the Portuguese authorities. The membefs have no passports and . no
credentials beyond a letter from Miss Clara Barton to the effect that she knows
gome trf then personally and believes them to be genuine, but many have openly
expresbed their Intention of fighting. The Boers are paying from Â£30 to Â£40 per
month for euch recruits."

GENERAL GATACRE, COMMANDER OF THE THIRD DIVISION.
WHO HAS JUST BEEN RECALLED TO ENGLAND. THE REASON
GIVEN IN THE DISPATCHES IS "ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FAILURE 3 TO
CHECK THE BOERS."
BLOEMFONTEIN. April 10.â General Gatacre. the commander of the
Third Division. Is about to return to England. General Gatacre's return
to England is accepted as being in the nature of a recall, though no rea
.son:is given for it. ar.d it will be associated in the public mind with his
. .lack of success. Lord Roberts criticized his management of the Storm
\liern attack, and possibly Gatacre's having arrived an hour and a half
too late to-feycue the Reddexsnurg force may -have decided his return. Gen
eral Bundle seemingly succeeds General Gatacre. ...
General Gatacre's military career up to the time of his disastrous defeat
a.t Stormberg, on December 10. had been one of uninterrupted. success. He en
tered the army as ensign of the Seventy-seventh Foot in February. ISC2. at the
age of 19. Besides several Important staff appointments, he served In the
Hayara expedition of ISSS. the Burmah campaign of ISS9-90 and the Chltral ex
pedition' of 1805, in which he commanded a brigade of the relief force. His last
field service before being assigned to the command of the Third Division of the
army for the Invasion of the Trans\-aal was with Kitchener in the Nile expedi
tion, in which he commanded the British brigade and won his major general
ship for his services at the battle of the Atbara.
POWERFUL'S GALLANT CREW WELCOMED.
LONDON, April 11.â The British first class cruiser Powerful, whose brigade
did such splendid service In the defense of Ladysmlth. arrived at Portsmouth this
afternoon ar.d was received with gTeat enthusiasm by thourands of people. ThÂ©
whole town appeared to be fn.the neighborhood of the waterside, which was lav
ishly decorated with bunting, while the fortifications and other points of vantage
were thronged with cheering crowds waving flags. The warships In the harbor
were ablaze with bunting and their crews manned ship and cheered and cheered
again cs the Powerful entered. The babel of sounds caused by the bands, the
cheering and the shrieking of .the sirens was deafening.
The First Lord of the Admiralty, George J. Goschen; Admiral Sir Michael
Culm-Seymour, the commander in chief at Portsmouth; Lord Durham, and oth
ers welcomed Captain Lambton, his officers and crew.
To-day's intensely enthusiastic reception of the Powerful was merely an unoffi
cial welcome from the soldiers, sailors and inhabitants of Portsmouth. The offi
cial civic reception, for which elaborate preparations have been made, has been
postponed until April 24. ....
COMPLETING DEFENSES AT BLOEMFONTEIN.
LONDON, April 12.â The Bloemfontein correspondent of the Daily Telegraph,
In a dispatch dated Tuesday, says: "The permanent defenses are nearlng com
pletion, so that . the town can be held by a' relatively small garrison. A British
scout who has visited the Bloemfontein water works reports that the machinery
and dams are intact. Only a few Boers . remain In the neighborhood. The
enemy have trekked six miles north and formed a laager near Waterval. News
from General Brabant at Wepener shows that all is going satisfactorily there.
The troops are getting new khaki, siege uniforms and boots."
GRASS ON HILLS FIRED BY BOERS.
ELANDS. LAAGTE, Wednesday, April 11.â Last right the Boers set fire to
the grass on" two hills almost on their extreme wings. The motive has not
been ascertained, but the Incident disclosed the fact that their position ex
tends over fully fifteen miles in a continuous i row of hills from Joneskop on
the British left to'a kopje commanding Sundays River bridge on the British
right. During the night the Boers moved most of their cannon. There has
been some unimportant skirmishing to-day. " The British still command Sundays
River bridge. No development from yesterday's affair Is expected.
BOERS ARE EXHIBITING INDECISION.
LONDON. April 12.â The Bloemfontelri correspondent of the Morning Post, tele
graphing on Tuesday, says: "The Boer 3 ;to the southeast are exhibiting inde
cision of movement, possibly In consequence of our occupation of the railway.
Bodies of the enemy are still moving, from Winberg southward through Thaba
Nchu. Their destination has not been ascertained. The Boers in the .neigh
borhood of Paardeberg show no disposition to interrupt our communication with
Kimberley, from which point civil convoys are still arriving."
KIPLING IS RETURNING TO ENGLAND.
CAPE TOWN, Wednesday. April 11.â Rudyard Kipling and Sir John Henry

ers is abating.
GALLANT COLONEL BADEN-POWELL. WHO COMMANDED IN
MAFEKING DURING THE LONG DAYS OF ITS EVENTFUL SIEGE BY
THE BOERS.
BRETORIA. April 10â It is reported here that Colonel Baden-Powell,
the British commander at Mafekir.g, is dead.
The dÂ»ath of the gallant defender of Mafeking. If the report be
true, will prove a most serious logs to the British arms and doubtless
presages the early fall of the place who?e defense he planned and has
60 ably conducted for now nearly six months. \ /
"JS-T."'TtiP nickname by which the colonel (whqsui. right name Is Robert
Stephfenson Smyth Baden-Powell) Is popularly knov.-n in the. army, was born
February 22, 1557, He entered the Thirteenth Hussars as pun-lieutenant. In
1576. was brevetted lieutenant colonel and transferred to the Fifth Drasoon
Guards In 1537. He filled several Important staff and special service appoint
ments, besides taking part in the operations in Zululand in ISSS, the Ashanti
expedition In 1655-6. and the South African operations in 1836, in v/hich he was
chief of Ftaff to the commander of tÂ«.e forces and won his^ brevet as colonel.
Colonel Baden-Powell was a bachelor, and leaves his. mother and a sister,
who reside in London, besides three brothers, one of whom, Warrlngton, Is
Queen's counsel to the admiralty; another. B. F. S.. colonel of the First Scots
Guards, and the third, Frank, is a painter and sculptor of considerable
note.
T ON DON , April 12.â Everybody here is loth to believe the story from Pretoria of a further
/ British reverse and the Boers capturing poo more men. The report created something akin to dis
may in London yesterday, and the public, therefore, -was quite ready to accept -with joy the state
ment that the War Office did not credit the story. The relief felt zcas all the greater when Lord Roberts'
dispatches arrived reporting the activity of the Boers in the south of the Free State, but nothing of any
disaster to the British troops.
Still, the feeling exists in London that they cannot be too sure till another day has passed, for it
must be remembered that it has usually taken some time for the British version of checks and reverses to
reach this country. This is natural when it is taken into consideration that detached columns from the
Free State arc operating at a considerable distance from headquarters.
The Wcpcncr garrison continues to hold out agai)ist the Boer. assault. Lord Roberts'' messages
make it plain that while he is moving men up rapidly to reinforce the defenders of the place he does noi
for a moment doubt that the garrison can continue to hold its own.
The cannonade in Natal appears to have been begun by the Boers and not by General Bullcr. The '
Boers, having mounted guns in position in Biggarsbcrg, which command some of the British camps,
opened fire on them while the British were making a movement which Sir Redvers describes as a change
of front, but did little damage. . The naval guns replied at once, and the cavalry and infantry swarmed
out on a reconnaissance and found that the Boers had entrenched themselves very strongly, a fact that, as
they have been working diligently with the spade for the last month, cannot surprise them.
One of the correspondents' opinion is that this shelling at long range was a mere, blind to drazv
attention from a contemplated move by the Boers in some other quarter. They are thought to be no
longer in force near Matazvanas Kop, some miles northzvest of Elands Laagtc. The British cavalry arc,
hozvrjcr, zvatching the passes to prevent any sudden raids or incursions of small parties. ,
It is also reported that General Gatacrc is returning to England and that General Chennside is
proceeding to take up his command at Springfontcin.
Very little comment is made on \ the piece of nczt's'by this morning's papers. It is taken as not
surprising, and, as the Daily Telegraph says, a decision like this requires no comment:

Says Reports of the Coeur

Exaggerated.
Idaho's. Governor Declares That Not
a Single Witness for the
State "Was Quoted
Correctly.
?
Special IMspaich to The Call.
BOISE, Idaho, April 11.â Governor Steun
enbergr has returned from Washington,
where he testified before the House com
mittee that Investigated the Coeur d'Alene
affair. In the course of an Interview to
day the Governor was asked about the
correctness of the statement made by the
San Francisco Examiner that J. R. Sover
eign gave him the He when he narrated
the story of the oeth-bound organization.
The Governor said there was not a parti
cle of truth in the story. Sovereign* did
not make any denial or any statement of
any character whatever. Sovereign was
present, and, far from denying: the state
ment, bore the appearance of being too
completely crushed to say anything if he
wished to. â¢*â¢
"The New York Journal and the San
Francisco Examiner did not correctly re
port the testimony of a single witness ap
pearing before the committee," said Gov
ernor Steunenberg. "The testimony of the
dynamiters was magnified in every in
stance and made- to appear Â¦ a hundred
times worse than it really was. Not a sin
gle witness for the State was reponted
correctly in those papers, their alleged re
ports of the proceedings being a tissue of
lies throughout. These lies were manu
factured by Lentz, Sovereign, walking
delegates and notorious lobbyists. I my
self on one occasion saw them preparing
the report to be sent to the Journal and
the Examiner, and other witnesses for the
State witnessed . similar proceedings on
several occasions."
"What opinion did you form of Repre
sentatives Lentz and Sulzer?" was asked.
"I don't think I would be justified in
saying anything, about them." -_
The Governor waa assured that the pub
lic would be : glad to hear anything he
might have to say concerning those two
Representatives, since they had been so
conspicuous in the investigation, but he
preferred not to give his opinion for pub
lication. However, in speaking of Mr.
Lentz the Governor said:
"He is a man of very considerable abil
ity he is impulsive, radical, erratic and
an extremist; he is a resourceful man, but
is not deep." ' ' â¢ Â¦

BY SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Railroad Takes a Hand in the Contra
Costa and Marin Senatorial
Fight
Special Dispatch to The Â»Â¦Â»
MARTINEZ, April ILâ The Southern
Pacific Railroad Is showing Its hand In
the fight for State Senator to represent
the district which embraces Contra Costa
and Marin counties. The railroad power,
through the agency of James Stow and
J. H. Borland, Js advocating' the nomina
tion of James Rankin on the Republican
ticket. It Is called to mind that the rail
road forced Rankln's nomination on the
Republicans some years ago, but he was
defeated at the polls by Elliot McAllister,
a Democrat.
Contra Costa Is entitled to the Senator
ship this term, as Marin had the last
term. The Republicans, who highly com
mend the able services rendered - by
Charles M. Belshaw in the Assembly, de
sire that he shall represent the district
in the Senate. Assemblyman Belshaw re
fused to take orders from the company
and is therefore not In favor at railroad
headquarters. The word has been passed
out to give Rankin the nomination.
Belshaw's manly and courageous atti
tude in refusing ia the Legislature to*obey
the commands of the railroad power has
added greatly to his strength with the
people, but has aroused tho resentment
of the corporation.
a representative should exercise his Judg
ment and thought in the performance of
his duties, he is also the agent of the peo
ple for the registry of their will, and,
where it appears to him. as in this case,
that overwhelming public sentiment is
against his particular vote, he should not
defeat, but should follow their will at the
earliest opportunity. Particularly Is this
true where he is satisfied that the primary
purposes of the previous vote will In any
event be secured."

by a desire to have a judicial exposition
of the powers of Congress over posses
sions acquired by the treaty of Paris.
The Democratic State platform of 189S,
upon which I was elected to Congress,
reads: 'We favor the fullest investiga
tion of all conditions existing In the Phil
ippine Islands, affecting the interests and
obligations of our country and the matter
of their future treatment and disposition,
to the end that final action In relation
thereto shall be intelligent and based upon
full knowledge of all the facts that can
affect the Interests of the United States.'
The most important fact that can 'affect
the interests and obligations of our coun
try, in the Philippines is the determina
tion of their legal status and as to wheth
er or not our labor is to be thrown into
competition with their cheap peon, Malay,
Chinese and Japanese labor, and whether
or not an open-door thereto and for all
Chinese and Japanese in these possessions
is created, and they are to have the right
indefeasible to come into this country.
The answer to these important questions
being within the jurisdiction of the Su
preme Court alone, and the opportunity
to secure such being offered by the pass
age of the House Porto Rican bill. I con
ceived tt my duty to vote therefor.
"Since that bill was passed I have ex
amined Into tho cases now pending In the
United States courts in New York. Con
sultation with Solicitor General Richards
with reference thereto reveals the fact
that in one of these, at least, the Issues
therein made are such that the Supremo
Court will bo compelled to take Jurisdic
tion thereof and that therein full powers
of Congress upon this subject will of ne
cessity be determined. Further, so far as
Porto Rico is concerned, I stated at the
time that 'I regretted that Porto "Rico
should be made the subject of the test.'
It is now manifest from the expressions
of press and citizens, regardless of party,
that the public is desirous that Porto Rico
Bhould have free trade. I think that while

ENDS THE PORTO
RICAN STRUGGLE
House Republicans Pass the Tariff
Bill by a Majority of Flight
votes.
Â»â :
Measure Carrying Senate Amendments Will
Go to the President for His Signa
ture To-Day.
WASHINGTON. April 11.-The long and
bitter struggle over JhÂ« Porto Rican tariff
bill ended to-day, when the House, by a
vote of 161 to 153. concurred in all the
Senate amendments. The bill now re
quires only the signature of the Speaker
of the House and the President of the
Senate before going to the President for
his approval. These signatures will be
attached to-morrow and before nightfall
me bill probably will have become a law.
AÂ« the bill originally passed the House
It was a simple measure. Imposing 15 per
cent of the Dlngley rates on goods going
Into Porto Rico from the United States
and coming from Porto Rico into the
1 nited States. As amended by the Sen
ate and to-day agreed to by the House
all restrictions on goods coming into the
United States from Porto Rico are elim
inated and certain foodstuffs and other
articles which heretofore have gone into
xorto Rico free by executive order are
excluded from the operation of the 15 per
cent duty Imposed on goods entering the
Island from the United States. A com
lilete scheme of civil government for tho
island is also attached to the measure.
Upon the final vote, nine Republicans
voted against the billâ Heatwole of Min
nesota, Crumpacker of Indiana, Lane of
lowa. Littlefleld of Maine. McCall of
Massachusetts, H. C. Smith of Michigan.
Warner of Illinois. Fletcher of Maine and
Lcrimer of Illinois. Two Democratsâ
Davey and Meir of Louisianaâ were paired
with Democrats in favor of the bill and
one Democratâ Slbley of Pennsylvania â
voted for it outright. De Vries, the other
Democrat who voted for the original bill,
to-day voted against concurrence. Stall
ings <D.) of Alabama was the only mem
ber on either â¢ side absent and unpaired.
The vote came at 6 o'clock, after a very
interesting and at times exciting debate
at five hours, which covered not only the
bill, but the special order under which
thÂ« House acted. One of the most dram
atic features of the day was the reading
by Richardson, the minority leader, of
the original opinion of Charles E. Magoon,
the legal adviser of the War Department,
in favor of the view that the constitution
extended over Porto Rico ex proprio
vigore. Dolliver of lowa in reply, termed
Magoon a clerk who tried to overrule the
prest lawyer at the head of the War De
partment. Warner of Illinois. Crum
pacicer of Indiana; McCall of Massachu
setts and Lorimer of Illinois, also Repub
licans, made speeches against the motion
to concur.
Special Rule Debated.
As soon as the reading of the journal
v.-as concluded Dalzell of Pennsylvania,
one of the leader* of the majority and
a member of the committee on rules, pre
sented the special order under which the
iiouse was to operate, as follows:
Resol\-ed. That Immediately upon the adop
tion of this resolution the committee of the
Â¦whole on the state of the Union FhaJl be dis
charired from the consideration of H. R. 8145
(the Porto Rico bill) and the Senate amend
ments thereto; that the fame shall be con
sidered in thÂ» Houce until 5 p. m. Wednesday.
April 31. UW. when, without delay or other
meition. a vote shall be taken on the motion
to concur In the saJd Senate amendments In
fT<et-. All members shall have leave to print
on the subject of said bill and amendments
7or tÂ«>n days from the adoption of this rule.
Upon demand of Dalzell. the previous
question on the adoption of the rule was
oroVred.
Richardson, the minority leader, called
attention to the fact that the rule would
permit the House to vote upon a single
proposition. If it had been possible for
the Senate to add to the iniquity of the
original bill levying 15 per cent of the
Uingley duties on goods going into Porto
Rico, he said. It had done so in the so
called civil government amendment. Un
der the guise of a civil government, the
Senate, he said, had imposed an imperial
istic government upon the people of the
island. He asserted that it was never the
Intention of the Republicans of the House
in the first instance to enact any such
measure. He quoted President Mckinley.
Secretary Root. ex-President Harrison.
? x-Speaker Reed and other Republicans
cf national reputation in favor of free
trade with the islands, and drew a salvo
of applause from his Democratic col
leagues by characterizing the President.
In the language of ex-Speaker Reed, as
"the Emperor of Expediency."
Proceeding, he expressed his regret that
the Secretary of War had not seen fit to
furnish the opinion of Judge Charles A.
llagoon. the attorney of the Insular Bu
reau, to the effect that the constitution
extended px proprio vigore to our new
Â¦possessions, upon which he 6aid the orig
inal recommendations of; the President
and Secretary of War were based. He
read from extracts from this alleged sup
pressed opinion, which had been printed
In a New York newspaper. The reading
was frequently punctuated with applause.
Why, Richardeon asked, had the Presi
dent, the Secretary of War and the Re
publican party changed upon this whole
question? For reply, he read the state
ment of Professor Schurmann of the
Philippine Commission, that the "trusts
had gone down to Washington and had
grasped the Republican party by the
throat."
Babcock and Grosvenor Reply.
Babrock of Wisconsin, chairman cf the
Republican <'on*,TPSKional Campaign Com.
mfttec, indignantly resented the charge of
Richardson that ihe Republican Campaign
?.."cinmiit^e hail received a money consid
eration for the Porto Rico tariff bill. As
a member of that committee he desired to
announce it as absolutely without founda
tion, and he challenged any one to name
the Republican who was responsible for
euch a charge.
Jumping to his feet. Pierce of Tennessee
tried to interrupt Babrock, but the latter
waved him aside.
"He withdraws his challenge." shouted
a voice on the Democratic Bide, amid a
howl of derision.
Babcock paid no attention to It. The
phoe was on the other foot, he said. The
tobacco trust and the sugar trust had
Ktarted the free trade agitation. This
statement produced more derisive cries
from the opposition, which, however, were
drowned in Republican cheers.
Grosver.or of Ohio followed with a
speech that kept his Fide In almost con
tinuous applause. It was a glorious thing,
he 6aid. to witness the anxiety of the Dem
ocratic party and the mugwump press lest
the Republican party should destroy
itself. He had witnessed it before, but he
had never 6een it so zealous as now to
avert from the Republican party the
odium and curse of an outraged pnblic
sentiment. <Republican cheers.)
He hurled back in Richardson's teeth
the charge of bribery. Did the gentleman
from Tennessee, he asked, think he could
be a hypocrite everywhere? He himself
did not believe it. If he believed any Re
publican had made such a statement why
did he not investigate It?
"We do not believe it." cried Grosvenor.
"We know It is a He. (Republican ap
plause.) I do not say no man made the
statement, but if he did he Is a liar.
(Democratic Jeers.) Let the gentleman
from Tennessee bring in a resolution and
It will be adopted in fifteen minutes."
"1 did not make the statement myself,"
interrupted Richardson.
"Oh, no." retorted Grosvenor. "That is
like the shining, slippery character of the
gentleman." (Republican applause.)
Result of the Test Vote.
The viva voce vote was indecisive, and
to save time an aye and no vote was
taken on the adoption of the rule. The
announcement of the adoption of the rule
(ayes, 15b; noes, -42; present and not
voting, 11) was greeted with salvos of ap
plause on the Republican side. The large
majority was a general surprise. It was
regarded as a test vote.
The Republicans who voted against the
rule were: Crumpacker of Indiana, Heat
wole of Minnesota, Lane of lowa, LJttle
fleld of Maine, Lorlmer of Illinois. McCall
of Massachusetts, H. C. Smith of Michi
gan and Warner of Illinois. The only
Democrat voting for the rule was Sibley
of Pennsylvania.
It was decided that the time remaining,
three and a half hours, should be equally
divided between the two sides, Payne and
Richardson to control the time on their
respective sides. Payne yielded to Wat
son of Indiana, who opened the debate.
He pointed out the reasons which led the
President and his advisers tochange their
opinions. New information aa to condi
tions had been obtained. The Republican
party was a practical party. It met con
ditions as they arose. It had risen to the
occasion and had framed this bill, found
ed upon justice and wisdom. He railed
the Republican recalcitrants who "read
the newspapers and imagined they were
in the swelling current of nistory."
"Creatures pf Noah's ark," he asked,
addressing the other side, "what do you
propose? No voice comes from the tomb!"
(Republican applause.)
Richardson yielded thirty minutes to
McCall of Massachusetts, who divided his
time among the Republican opponents of
the bill. First H. C. Smith. of Michigan
Ftated the grounds of his opposition. He
believed with Bismarck that the world
was ruled from above, not below, and that
the God of nations and of battles pointed \
the victory to the right. Now was the j
exalted opportunity of this country, he
said, and it should be the Republican j
party which Should lead Jt. But as a be- I
'lever in the survivor cf the good and<
true, he said, he could not bring his con
science to support the bill. It was a
piece of bad faith against the people of !
Porto Rico, who had fallen upon their |
knees to the stars and stripes. General ;
Milts' promise then made should, he said, |
be redeemed. Good morals demanded it. !
Warner of Illinois urged the samt.
ground of objection. The bill was, he said,
a broach of trust.
"If this measure be adopted," he said,
"no people can safely become a part ot
us. as they can have no assurance of their
status or treatment. We may as well
write upon our borders, 'All hope aban
don, ye who enter here.' "
Predicts Disaster to the Nation.
I^orlmer of Illinois delivered a ten-min
ute speech in opposition to tho bill, which
elicited frequent applause from the oppo
sition.
"Mr. Speaker," said he in conclusion.
"I think we have reached the crisis In our
history; I think we need a liberty revival.
If we are true to ourselves we must have
it. If we are not true, then the ultimate
penalty will be dissolution of our repub
lican institutions. A nation which sur
renders its basic principle cannot survive.
1 am not an alarmist. 1 do not think the
dissolution will come in our day or gen
eration. Such changes work slowly, but
they are none the less inevitable. I doubt
not that as imperialists we will have our
day of grandeur and perhaps our imperial
splendor will eclipse that of ancient Rome.
"Columbia, if shamefully bedecked with
the precious pearl of the Antilles and the
gems of the Pacific and the Orient, may
oxciie for a time such admiration as is won
by riches and voluptuousness. But, sir,
the light of liberty, which is to her what
virtue is to woman, will have faded from
her eye. And all the riches of the world
cannot make up for that loss to those who
really love her; to those who look upon her
starry emblem as the symbol of God-given
rights and not as a commercial asset."
McCall of Massachusetts was the last
Republican who antagonized the bill. In
conclusion he said that the proposal to
tax the products of Porto Rico had aroused
indignation everywhere. It had trans
formed the whole country into a Boston
tea party. (Democratic applause.)
Hopkins of Illinois asserted that the bill
when enacted into law would be far more
advantagreou3 to the people of Porto Kico
than the United States laws in force in
New Mexico. Arizona or any Territory of
the United States. No money was taken
from the treasury of the United States for
building' schoolhouses and roads In any or
the Territories. The Internal revenue laws
of the United States were in full force in
the Territories. He claimed that the bill
was in strict accord with the human*
promises made by General Miles. <
Richardson of Tennessee, the minority
leader, concluded the debate on his side.
He was followed by Dolllver of lowai whtÂ»
dismissed as beneath contempt the charge
of bribery as a motive for this bill. This
was a Republican measure, he said. In
dorsed by the Republican President and
the Republican leaders.
PaynÂ« of New York, the floor leader of
i..c majority, closed the debate with a
vigorous speech, in which he said he was
ready to submit the issue involved In the
pending bill to the common people of the
country. '
Final Vote on the Measure.
At 6 o'clock the House, under the terms
of the special order, proceeded to vote.
The roll-call was followed with Intense
Interest. The only demonstrations oc
curred when Henry C. Smith of -Michigan
voted "no." and when the Speaker direct
ed the clerk to call his name an
swered "aye." . "When the Speaker an
nounced the passage of the billâ ayes, 161;

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALLj THUBSD AY, APRIL 12,, 1900.
SENATE PASSES
THE CABLE BILL
Designed to Establish Communi
tion Between San Francisco
and Hawaii
Navy Department Will Superintend Construc
tion and the Government Will
Operate the Line.
Special Dispatch to the Call.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON, April
11â If the present Congress adjourn without making provision for cable com
munication between the United States and Hawaii the responsibility will rest
with the House. The Senate to-day performed its share of the work of legis
lation by passing the Hale bill, which provides for the construction of a sub
marine cable between San Francisco and Honolulu, with the ultimate view of
extending the. line to the Philippines. According to the Senate bill passed to
day the work is to be performed under the auspices of the Navy Department,
and when the cable is completed It Is to be operated and controlled by the
Postmaster General. The sum of $3,000,000 is appropriated for the purpose. A
provision is Included requiring all material and appliances to be of American
manufacture. The pending House bill now on the calendar of that body con
templates the construction of a cable to the Philippines as a private enter
prise. It is therefore likely that there will be a clash between the House and
the Senate. At the present time it is difficult to say which one of the proposi
tions will prevail, or whether there will be any legislation at all during the
present session.
WASHINGTON, April ILâ With little
debate of consequence the Senate to-day
passed the Pacific cable bill, a measure
appropriating $3,000,000 for the construc
tion of a cable between San Francisco
and Honolulu. The bill. was unanimously
reported by the Committee on Naval Af
fairs, and that it was passed without ser
ious objection is regarded as a compliment
to the committee.
During the greater part of the session
the District of Columbia appropriation bill
was under consideration. As passed it
carries nearly $8,000,000.
A resolution was adopted calling upon
the President, if not Incompatible with
public Interest, to inform the Senate
whether any persons have been executed
by garrote in Porto Rico since the United
States authorities have been in control
of the island, and, if so, why the system
of execution was employed.
The resolution relating to the Quay caso
was laid before the Senate, and Burrows
of Michigan arose to address himself to
it. Allison of Connecticut requested Bur
rows to yield ta him, that he might have
the Senate take up the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill. This request waa
agreed to, it being understood that Bur
rows should proceed to-morrow with his
speech. After Penrose of Pennsylvania
had protested that appropriation bills
should not interfere with consideration
of the Quay case, the District of Colum
bia appropriation bill was formally taken
up and passed.
Text of the Cable Bill.
At the instance of Hale, chairman' of
the Naval Committee, the Senate then
took up the bill providing for the con
struction, maintenance and operation un
der the management of the Navy Depart
ment of a Pacific cable. The bill, as report
ed to the Senate, is a substitute for the
measure as originally introduced by Hale.
It carries an .appropriation of $3,000,000
for the project. _ .
The bill provides for a cable from San
Francisco to Honolulu, the work to be
done under the supervision of the Navy
Department, which has made surveys and
determined the practicability of the route.
The Navy Department may use any of its
ships that can be adapted to ihe task of
laying the cable and if it needs other
ships it may charter them. In addition to
this, it provides that the Secretary of the
Navy," in his discretion, if he finds it is
not practicable to lay the cable by the
force of his own department, may con
tract, under specifications and due ad-
vertisement, for the construction, laying
and equipment of the cable. All materials
and appurtenances Bhall be of special
quality.
Section 5 provides that the cables, wires
and other instruments, materials, appli
ances and appurtenances necessary in the
work of laying the cable shall be of Amer
ican manufacture, provided the same can
be procured at a cost not exceeding 13 per
cent above what the same can be pro
cured for in foreign markets.
Hale explained that the bill provided
for the building of the cable from San
Francisco to Honolulu. This, he said,
would be In the nature of an experiment,
and upon the result of it would depend
in a measure the future course of the
Government. It might be deemed desira
ble in the light of experiment to start the
Philippine cable from some point like Se
attle and proceed to Japan by the north
ern route,
Pettus moved to strike out section 5 of
the bill.
"Why." he inquired, "should the Gov
ernment consent to be taxed on its own
business for the benefit of certain manu
factures? It's an absurdity. Even if you
do rob the people by your taxes, you
ought not to rob the Government."
Tillman of South Carolina, as a member
of the Naval Committee, defended the
bill, in the report of which all the Demo
cratic members of the committee had
joined. While he was not, he said, a pro
tectionist or in favor of subsidies, he re
garded the provision in section 6 of this
bill in the Interest of the people, as it
would be a "sort of nursing bottle" to the
Industries interested. He deemed It a de
sirable experiment in Government owner
ship and control, and expressed the opin
ion that it might prove a good thing for
Alabama.
"Up to this date." said Pettus. "Ala
bama will not accept your bribe. I have
seen one great State near mine accept the j
sugar bottle and I don't like it."
Tlllman disclaimed^ any effort to bribe i
either Senator Pettus or the State of Ala- '
baina, but he was anxious to Increase the ;
struggling iron and steel Industries of Â¦
Alabama, and he hoped to see the day
when a Government armor plate factory

the Middle West Jobbers at present was
of that destructive character resorted to
only temporarily, and that should they
succeed in driving the Pacific Coast job
bers from the field prices would again
range at about the same figures as now
quoted by the coast jobbers. He gave
frequent illustrations of what Chicago
and St. Louis jobbers had done in his
territory.
A very interesting bit of testimony was
given by Mr. Goldsmith relating to tho
St. Paul differentials. He positively swore
that Vice President Hannaford of the
Northern Pacific told him and other Se
attle Jobbers that the reduction of dif
ferentials made at St. Paul was in re
sponse to Middle West pressure. Mr.
Hannaford was alleped to have said:
"We changed the differential at St. Paul
because of Middle West pressure. The
Jobbers of that district threatened to
route freight against our road unless w"e
lowered tho differentials. We have a good
many points through Montana and Da
kota where there are other lines com
peting than the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific and we felt that wo
could not resist the demand of the Mid
dle West Jobbers and that they would
route freight against us unless we lowered
the differential."
Witness also explained to the commis
sion that Middle West Jobbers could now
ship freight 700 miles for the same figures
that Pacific Const jobbers could ship 350
miles.
Twoi local retail hardware men appeared
before the commission to testify against
the statements of the coast Jobbers. They
claimed the consumer was injured by a
wide differential and aided when the dif
ferential was lowered so that the Middle
West men could more easily enter this
field.
Their testimony was made ridiculous in
the cross-examination of Mr. Pillsbury,
counsel for the coast, who proved ri'y
themselves that the consumer was ben
efited neither way. When the differential
was wide the Middle West Jobber allowed
the freight to cover the differential, and
when the differential was lowered or
abolished no such freight allowances were
made, thus proving that the fight was
merely between Jobbers and did not affect
consumers.

has invented a scheme whereby ten or
twelve Alaska Indian tribes. are being led
to contribute Jointly to a large fund with
whl<j,h Chief Johnson is to be sent to
Washington City as their delegate. If
they succeed Fred Moore will go as chief
aid, and they will have a retinue com
prising one -member from each of the
Kaka, Stickecn, Hyda, Metlakatla, Auk,
Chilkat, Sltka, Taku, Hoonah and other
Indian tribes. Johnson's plea Is that his
presence in Washington is necessary that
entire justice may be done the Indians.
Ho wishes to raise $10,000. Indians of the
Auk tribe about Juneau have been worked
up to a hisrh pitch by Johnson, who claims
that Governor Brady is trying to Induce
the President to make an Indian reserva
tion near Sltka. move all the Indians In
southeastern Alaska thereon, build high
board fences around them and keep them
Inside. Johnson told them that if any
tried to escape they would be sjjot by sol
diers. By going to Washington he can
avoid this calamity.
To-day's news from Alaska shows the
Sltka and Chilkat Indians at the head of
Lynn canal to be greatly wrought up over
the arrest of a dozen of their fellows as a
result of the Horton double murder.
There are ten Indians to every white

Inlet. Chilkat River and Klukwan. An
uprising would result disastrously to
whites if It should occur quickly.

Sitka tribes are at outs, and last week
had a severe tight in which a number on
both sides were injured. Both tribes have
organized salvation armies, patterned
after the one at Skaguay. Rivalry haa
run high, each side claiming that the other
tribe should disband Its army and join,
theirs. It also develops that the Indians
in custody at Skaguay for the murder of
the Hortons are about .equally divided be
tween these two tribes. Hanson, who first
confessed. Is a Chilkat, and the Sltkas
want to kill him for having caused the

TUCSON, Ariz., April ILâ Abraham S.
Humphries of Honolulu, Hawaii, formerly
a resident of Arizona; a native of Missis
sippi, is a candidate for appointment on
the Supreme bench of Hawaii. Humphries
left Arizona about five years ago and
went direct to Honolulu. He married an
heiress, and it is said he has gained dis
tinction in hla profession. His candidacy
for judgeshlp, announced here yesterday,
caused much acrimonious comment on ac
count of the unfortunate reputation he
gained for himself while practicing law
at Phoenix and Florence.
W. F. Cooper, District Attorney of Pima
County, has sent serious charges against
Humphries to Washington, among others
that he embezzled large sums of Insurance
money from two widows, paid by the
Ancient Order United Workmen on ac
count of death of their, husbands. This
was at Florence, where.. when he left, he
stated he was going to Prescott and would
return in a few days, but went right
through to Honolulu, where he has slnco
been. A number of creditors at Florence
mourned his loss. The charges also al
lege that Humphries has been placed un
der arrest at Phoenix on a charge of com
plicity in procuring a criminal operation
on a woman named White. A mob threat
ened summary punishment, but he es
caped. The next day he got Into a street
shooting scrape with P. Minor over the
matter and several shots were ex
changed.
At Florence, it is alleged, Humphries got
into several disgraceful fights, in one of
which he attacked an old man named Gil
bert with a knife, cutting him badly.
Those most intimately acquainted with
Humphries state he was betimes men
tally unbalanced, which accounted for his
peculiar and erratic conduct. His aspira
tions to the Supreme bench have caused
many to take active interest in the mat
ter here.

SAN JOSE, April 11.â The dissatisfac
tion which has existed f Â»r some time in
tho congregation of the First Unitarian
Church of this city has resulted In a;va
cancy in the pulpit. At the annual meet
ing last evening there was such an'oppo
sition to Rev. N. A. Haskell that he was
not re-elected pastor for the ensuing
year. . Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦â¢Â¦
For the last twelve years Rev. Mr. Has
kell has been pastor of the church. Dur
ing the past twelve mefnths the cbngse
gatiort haa become divided, many think
ing the pastor .was not Bodable : enough.
No successor to the pulpit has boon elect
ed, but the trustees nave been empowered
to fill the pulpit from Sunday to Sunday
until a position.be regularly flljed. Thero
are threats of . some of the congregation
resigning because of the . removal of Mr.
Haskell. â¢ - â¢
Owing to the congestion and the difficulty
of unloading and setting up quantities of
articles in their proper places things wera
so bad that he would not trust himself to
discuss the matter. His railway would be
a loser, as people were not likely to come
in large numbers until certain of some
thing to see. He jfave his opinion that in
the month of June visitors would flock to
the capital in a vast crush, but was not
sanguine of much railway traffic before
that.

CONFERENCE ON
THE SUBJECT OF
OPEN PRIMARIES
Meeting of Fourth and Fifth
District Republican Com
mittees.
Representatives of the Fourth Dis
trict Oppose the Scheme of Ap
pointments â Objection to
Primaries.
A joint meeting of sub-committees rep
resenting the Fourth and Fifth Repub- i
lican Congressional District committees
took place last evening at the Palace Ho
tel, and views were freely interchanged
regarding the manner of choosing dele
gates to the respective district conven
tions. The Fourth District was^repre
eented by Joseph Spear Jr., P. H?*Pren
dergast. Dr. P. A. Kearney and Archibald
Barnard. The representatives of the
Fifth were Max Goldbtrg, J. Alva Watt,
W. H. Cobb and Frank French. Shortly
after the discussion began it became ob
vious that the committeemen of the
Fourth had resolved to hold open prima
ries in that district, and it also became
apparent that the representatives of the
Fifth were bent on presenting as many
obstacles as could be devised against the
adoption of the primary plan.
Joseph Spear, as chairman of the con
ference, stated the object of the meeting.
Mr. Prendergast without hesitation as
serted that the Republicans of the Fourth
District were opposed to the system of
appointing delegates and favored an open
primary wherein a fair expression of the
will of the people could be obtained.
J. Alva Watt inquired whether the com
mitteemen of the Fourth had any detailed
plan to submit and was informed that
no plan was contemplated other than that
which had always been sanctioned by the
party in San Francisco.
Mr Watt desired to know If Mr. Pren
dergast had made any figures on appor
tionment. A production ot exhibits in this
respect proved that both Watt and Pren
dergast had figures. The calculations of
the former were that San Francisco was
entitled to 112 delegates, based on the
number of votes cast for Gage. In the
seven Assembly districts of the Fifth
Congressional District in the city of San
Francisco 14,053 votes were cast for Gage.
In the entire Fourth Congressional Dis
trict, or eleven Assembly districts, the
vote for Gage was 14.1G3. It was therefore
figured by Watt and Max Goldberg that
the Fifth District territory in San Fran
cisco was entitled to 56 votes, or one-half
the city representation. Mr. Prendergast
produced figures of representation by As
sembly districts." The districts in the
Fifth were entitled to delegates aa fol
lows:
Thirty-fourth Assembly District i
Thirty-fifth Assembly District. B

â¢ Total M
The apportionment thus disclosed was
go manifestly fair and Just that Messrs.
Goldberg. Watt. French and Cobb found
no fault whatever with the representation
accorded to the Fifth. In addition to the
flfty-four delegates in San Francisco, the
districts in Santa Clara and San.Mateo
counties will be represented. Mr. Watt
moved that the sub-committee report to
the general committee in favor of accept
ing the apportionment, and the motion
prevailed. Â«...
Mr Prendergast inquired: "Now, when
and how shall we elect the delegates?"
Mr. Spear remarked that he had heard
from many Republicans and the expres
sion was in favor of open primaries.
Mr. PrendergaÃt said the Fourth Dis
trict committee had adopted a resolution
in favor of primaries, and a meeting had
been called for Friday night of this week
to complete arrangements. He hoped
that the Fifth District would hold pri
maries on the same day that the election
was held in the Fourth.
Mr. Watt insisted on knowing all about
the details of the proposed primary in
the Fourth. He remarked that the old
Porter primary law had been repealed,
and, therefore, the election would' not
have the protection of the law. He re
gretted that Mr. Prendergast was not
able to present the scheme in detail.
Mr. Prendergast replied that there were
i no details to arrange beyond the naming
of the time of holding the primary and
the apportionment of inspectors .of elec
tion. He had an idea that April 25 would
be about the right time. :
Max Goldberg, chairman of the commit
tee of the Fifth, said his associates had
not discussed the matter. All that they
could do at present was to listen. Mr.
Goliberg was particularly anxious to
know if the County Committee was to
have a voice in the management of the
primaries. He said that Mr. Bouvier had
been to see him ajid given notice that the
County Committee would demand repre
sentation on every election board. He
feared that harmony would not be srÂ»-<
moted by such a primary, election. Mr.
Goldberg said thnt he was not committed
to the system of appointing delegates.
The representatives of ihe Fourth Dis
trict maintained thai the duty of appoint
ing election officers devolved upon the
Congressional committee and could not be
delegated to any other committee.
Many inquiries were made regarding the
probable expense of holding primaries.
Dangers of ignoring the County Commit
tee were dwelt upon. Mr. Cobb feared
that a primary would introduce a three
ring circus. Allusion was made to the
fact that the Democrats frequently cre
ated conventions by appointment. Mr.
Prendergast remarked that Democrats
could do any kind of raw work and the
party followers would submit. It was
different with Republicans. They would
not submit to usurpation of power by a
committee.
Mr. Cobb declared that he had heard no
demand for a primary election. Mr. Watt
also said that he had not heard of any
Republican that wanted a piimary elec
tion.
Frank French vigorously opposed the
old-fashioned ballot-box-Btutling primar
ies, and gave notice that he would call a
meeting of the club of his district.
Archibald Barnard was positive that the
people were in favor of the primary plan.
The fact that the. law sanctioned- the
principle of primary election proved that
the people favored the plan.
Mr. Spear inquired if any committee
man had heard expressions in favor of
appointing delegates. When pressed to
the point members of the Fifth District
committee would not acknowledge that
they were in favor of appointment, but
they expressed regret that a definite plan
for the control of the proposed primaries
had not been presented by the commtttee
men of the Fourth District.
Mr. Goldberg's main objection to pri
maries grew out of the apprehension that
the County Committee would be Ignored.
After further discussion it was decided
to defer action until Friday of next week.
In the meantime a meeting of the entire
Fifth District Congressional Committee
will be called. Later on J. Alva Watt
may hear from some of the Republicans
of the district.

PARISHIONERS PREPARE
FOR THEIR EASTER DUTY
Rev. P. C. Yorke Appeals to His Con
gregation to Fight Against the
Flood of Sin.
In addition to the usual solemn services
of holy week at St. Peter's Church, Rev.
P. C. Yorke inaugurated last evening the
first of a series of discourses to assist his
parishioners In preparing for their Easter
duty. His subject was "The Atonement."
Every pew in the church was occupied
and many stood In the slda and rear
aisles. '
The services preceding the address were
extremely impressive. Father Yorke in
his discourse- sought to imprint indelibly
upon the minds of his parishioners the
great duty they owe their God. He said
that while all seemed to appreciate the
goodness and the greatness or the Savior,
few were ready to do him the homage to
which he 1? entitled.
"God is justice," said the speaker. "If
we sin against him he himself cannot
forgive unless we make adequate repara
tion. He hates sin, yet we know he is
filled with love for the sinner. The power
of destruction is in every man's hand: the
power of reparation is no one's but God's,
we are tearing down daily the great
dykes which he has bullded up to keep
back the flood of sin."
This evening the eloquent divine will
take for his subject "The Real Presence."

THREE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION'S COMMITTEE WHOSE WORK HAS
MADE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CLUB POSSIBLE.
HUNTINGTON DECLINES
TO VISIT SAN DIEGO
On Receiving a Formal Invitation
From TJ. S. Grant and G. W.
Mar stem He Pleads Lack
of Time to Go. '
U. S. Grant and G. W. Marston of San
Diego called upon Collis P. Huntlngton
yesterday and in the name of the citizens
of their city invited the Southern Pacific
Company's president to .visit San Dlogo
during his stay in California and to note
its growth and prospects. The people of.
Ban Diego want the railroad extended
into the heart of the city and they believe
that if Iluntington would visit thnt sec
tion he could readily become convinced
that the extension of his road would 'be a
sound business proposition.
Huntington received the delegates pleas
antly, but declined the invitation, on the
ground that his time during hia stay in
Onlltornia would be bo much taken up
with other matters of more importance
to the company, that it would be impos
sible for him to spare the time to go down
to San Diego. Messrs. Grant and Marstort
took the refusal to mean that they can
expect nothing from the Southern Pacific
for th<Â» present at least. They left for
their home in the south yesterda-y â¢after
noon, after having been but a few hours
in the city. Â»

SALMON IS NOW
THE MONARCH OF
ALL FOOD FISH
Largely Fed to the; Armies
of England in South 'â¢
Africa.
Germany Is Also a Large Qonsumex
of the Prepared Product â Can
ners Are Paying Higher
Prices Than Ever.
Â»
The common salmon or commerce if now
a luxury, the prices paid by the packers
on the Sacramento River being higher
than since ISW. In that year the
scarcity of these fiFh. made the prices
po up; but that is not the reason this sea
son. The spring run is good, from all ac
counts, and prompts to hold up; yet the
river canners are paying 5 cents a pound
to the fishers and contracts are made for
ev^ry pound that can be caught. This
rale is being paid by the Sacramento
River packers at Benicia. Vallejo and
Black Diamond, and the new company at
the latter place has gone as high as 6
corns a pound, which is the present price
to the retail trade. In past seasons 3
cents has been the prevailing rate. Yes
terday over SOO QSh were gent to the local
market, which represents but a small por
tion 'of the catch.
There are several reasons for this re
markable rise In prices. First and most
Important is the fact that the people of
the world are recognizing that a better
food fish than the quinnat salmon is hard
to find, and the demand for the canned
article has started up the canneries to
their full capacity all along the coast
Another reason, and one of no little mo
ment. Is that large quantities of canned
salmon are being shipped to England,
which nation has made this one of the
staple articles of food for her army. At
the time of the Spanish-American war the
ciMcers of the army axid navy found that
tbe men could stand any amount of work
if fed on this article, and considerable
was ordered for the United States army.
At the close of that war came the Eng
lish-Boer war. and the demand on the
cannere was greater than ever. Although
great quantities are sent weekly to South
Africa, the supply Is kept up well from
the United States, British Columbia and
Alaska-
There Is still another great consumer of
these ilsh products in the Pacitlc. Ger
many did not take long to conclude that
what is good for the United States and
British armies is good for her troops, and
her purchases are by no means small.
That Germany Is a good- market is shown
by the conduct of the new cannery at
Black Diamond. This institution will not
htart up until the middle of next week.
but it is not letting a pound of fish go by.
All the salmon it can get are being sent
tÂ« Vallejo. where they are put in cold
brine and packed in barrels. These are
being pent to New York and from there to
Europe, Germany being the principal pur
chaser. In that country the salmon Is un
packed and smoked, not only for general
fonpumntion but for the army as welL

Teachers' Mayday Festival.
The teachers' Mayday festival at Glen
Park promises to be a big success. Every
posslble preparation for the suitable re
ception and entertainment of a large
crowd Is now being made. Children will
be admitted free and adults will be
charged 25 cents. Special arrangements
have been made to assure the safety of
the children. A corps of teachers under
the direction of Professor Brooks will
have charge of the children on the
grounds.' The programme, which will In
clude first-class talent, Is not yet ar
ranged.
cording to some reports received, the en
tire peach and apricot crop has been killed
in places. The warm temperature ani
rain are much appreciated, though much
volunteer hay is cut and will be damaged.
FRESNO, April 11.â The frost visitations
on Sunday and Monday night have dona
some damage to tender vine shoots by
burning them black and retarding their
growth to that extent. Fruit trees were
not damaged, the fruit being pretty weil
formed. It is generally said that the
vines were damaged to the extent of 23
per cent. The frost appeared In scattered
streaks.
RAIN IN NORTHERN AND
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
Growing Crops Throughout Those
Sections Are Greatly Benefited
by the Precipitation.
The rain that began yesterday had not.
up to the evening report of the Weather
Bureau, extended southward farther than
about midway between San Francisco and
Fresno, in the San Joaquin Valley. Santa
Clara Valley and the Salinas Valley re
ceived a mild wetting. The rain was gen
eral In the north, up to Central Oregon.
At no place was the downfall heavy, ex
cept at Eureka, where the gauges record
ed nine-tenths of an inch. Elsewhere the
precipitation was about one-quarter of an
Inch.
.Forecaster ilcAdle said that the storm
would do the fields good In Northern and
Central California, and thaf the reports
all were that the outlook was now for a
bountiful yield of the fields and orchards.
The grain in Southern California Is too
lar gone to have any chance, even If
tnere should be rain in that section. The
miners now have more water than they
had at the same time last year up to the
corresponding date. Los Angeles has had
a little more rain than it had last year,
but needs still more. San Diego has had
over an Inch less than it had last year.

State.
SACRAMENTO. April 11.â Thera have>
bepn several light showers of rain here
to-day and it is coming down gently this
evening. About one-tenth of an Inch has

on the low lands have suffered severely
by Sunday night's frost, but grain and
tree fruits are all right.
LOS ANGELES, April 11.â The weather
and crop conditions In Southern Califor
nia have not changed since the official bul
letin of the United States Department of

most localities are failures and young
fruit- is dropping. Oranges are in gooa
condition.
SAN RAFAEL. April 11.â It commenced
raining here this morning, and from pres
ent Indications will continue throughout
the night. The farmers are I'll happy, as
the crops In this county will be- better
than ever before. The rainfall for the
season is 29 inches.
MILTON. April 11.â A light rain has
fallen at intervals here to-day. With the
wind In the rainy quarter there is good
ground for hoping for a considerable fall,
which would be of the greatest benefit
now.
REDDING. April 11.â A slight rain has
been falling for the past twenty-four
hours. The precipitation insures the fin
est feed stockmen have known for years.
Although not especially beneficial to
farmers It was welcomed by miners as
assuring an extension to the already,
lengthy season.
SANTA CRUZ. April 11.â Rain com
menced falling early this morning and has
continued In showers all day, with no
prospects of clearing. The elements have
dealt gently with farmers in this section
and only light frosts have been reported
with no damage. Fruit prospects are
good.
REDWOOD CITY, April 11.â Redwood
City and vicinity have been visited with
several heavy showers of rain within the
last twelve hours. While the rain has
not been sufficient to penetrate to any
depth yet in connection with the rains
experienced about the first of the month
the ground has been kept moist. An un
usually heavy crop is assured for this
season.
MODESTO, April 11.â Rain began fall
ing at noon to-day and by this evening
.31 of an Inch had fallen. The wind ia still
from a rainy quarter. The rain is benefi
cial.

here for the last two mornings, but so
far little or no damage has resulted In
Napa or vicinity.
WOODUiVND, April 11.â It can be defin
itely stated that the recent heavy frost
resulted In no material damage to Yolo
County vineyards and orchards. The
weather has been showery to-day and

tions' may continue long enough to insure
good crops. Unless there Is more than
grain crops in this part of the State will
be short.
Vineyards Damaged.
STOCKTOX. April 11.â Reports continue
to come In of the damage to grape vines
by the recent frost. At G. C. Franklin's
ranch, six miles west of Lodl, and at the
ranch of Mrs. E. Franklin, n mile to the
southwest, the loss Is total. In the former
there are twenty acres of vines and eighty
acres In the latter. To secure even naif
a crop it -will be necessary to remove all
the frost-bttten shoots : that the dormant
buds may come out. The Moore ranch,
north of Stockton, comprising thirty acres
of grapes, reports a total loss. Ltcrht
showers have been falling here this morn-
Ing and the Indications are that a heavy
downpour is on the tapis.
SAN JOSE. April ll.â Reports received
from all parts of the county indicate
much more damage from frost than first
stated. The universal statement from the
southern end of the county is that. there
was a freeze and that â¢ apricot* and
peaches are totally destroyed. - Grapes
nave suffered Â»rreatly over nearly the en
tire county. There are but few orchards
where the apricots and peaches have not
suffered severely. Prunes have not suf
fered-greatly except in a few localities,
but it Is too soon to tell the result.
Colonel Phllo Hersey of the Santa Clara
County Fruit Exchange says it Is too soon
to tell, the total damage by frost yet. but
thatjnuch fruit haa been killed; and, ac-

TYPICAL SCENE IN FRANK & PAUL'S DANCE HALL
THE Police Commission of San Fran
cisco is now busy -with the saloon
men, side entrances, restaurateurs
and drink dispensers. The most In
decent, immoral, sinful and criminal
phase of gutter life in this city Is left
untouched. While the work of a partial
reformation progresses but slowly and in
consistently the dives on the Barbary
Coast and in the heart of the city are
allowed to run without a check or posi
tive restraint.
The Call has directed the attention of
the police to many of these sinks of deg
radation and vice. From one street ta
aii'ilicr in the Ccas'- district the discord
ant and key-worn piano, the accordion
and the banjo, mingle their sounds In in
harmonious effects to the accompaniment
cf the clink of glasses, while the habitues
of the dives in this locality become
heavy and sopped with the bad liquor
dispensed at a price that is ruinous to
the financial welfare of the patron and
only beneficial to the woman who trains
her commission by a practice of low and
obscene personal artifices.
The dive and the dance hall are the two
distinct phases of debasement In this
quarter. In one the man without reason
or sense squanders bis pittance for noth
ing but bad beer or worse whisky; the
other for the same physical recompense
with the addition of a trip or two over
a slippery floor, which simply accelerates
a thirst. .*'.
The ordinary white customer of the
dives may be vicious, unregenerate and
steeped In vice, but he Is covered with a
garment of virtue and righteousness when
compared to hJs foreign brother. On Pa
cific street and* Broadway are resorts of
to low a character that were It not for
the fear of the threatened lntereference
of the police, robbery, theft and kindred
crimes would be of nightly occurrence.
Under the guise of a dance hall sign un
couth and hardened men mingle with
Â¦women long since lost to every show of
morality and wear out the night In
drunken revels that fill their purses with
brass checks, representing In a mone
tary way the price of their chosen occu
pation.
One of the worst of these dance halls
frequented by all classes of people is
owned by Frank & Paul. It is on Pacific
street and not a stone's throw from the
County Jail. The women who spend their
nights In this resort are dancers and
drinkers, for, by the exercise of both these
accomplishments, they gather in the
checks that enable them to support both
themselves and the people they love. The
arts of seduction which they practice are
simple to the man about town, but full
of power to the ordinary patron. Seated
at a table, men pour down their throats
a quality of beer and whisky that would
be expensive at one-tenth the price
charged. All this time the girls are grow
ing fat, not only on malt, but brass
checks, laughing to themselves at the
idiocy of the men. At a late hour the
patrons of the house become soaked with
liquor and a general rough-house pre
vails. This is a lively feature and waited
for by the habitues.
When will the evil cease? Will It con
tinue to suppurate and go unnoticed by
the Police Department or will they show
themselves alive to the exigency of things
and sweep away these -vicious blots of
Immorality?
POLICE COMMISSION MEETS.
Saloon Men Appear Before That Body
and Advise With Its Members.
The Police Commissioners met yesterday
morning with the saloon men of the city
to hear arguments .why the various pro
prietors of saloons and restaurants should
not be forced to conform to the ordinance
of 1593 which provides for the selling of
liquor in places of mixed character, a
mingling of saloon and restaurant, and
the reduction in height of the side-room
partitions.
Outside of a protective meeting, per
haps never before in, this city was there
such an assemblage of directors of the
cocktail mixers. From far and near pro
prietors of saloons gathered to pour their
tales of woe Into the Commissioners' ears
and each to claim that he alone should
be exempt from the enforcement of the
ardinance. After hearing the attorneys
>f the saloon men for two hours, the Com
missioners decided to take the case under
advisement, postponing action until some
future day.
Judge Slack was the first to make his
May for Techau"s Tavern and the Good
Fellows' Grotto. According to the Judge,
leither place was immoral or Indecent
md the serving of drinks was merely in
cidental to the serving of meals, therefore
:he partitions of the small rooms should
lot be cut down.
Attorney Marcus Rosenthal. represent
ng the Bay State restaurant, was the
second on the argumentative platform,
lie discussed the ordinance, averring that
t did not apply to restaurants and hotels
Â»nd there would be no violation of the or
iinance where liquor was sold. Rosen
thal then read the Commissioners a lee-
ture on vice and Immorality and contend
ed that they could not suppress either by
the present methods. He promised the
Commissioners that his client would not
run a bar, because It did not pay. The
board did not Interest themselves In the
financial success of the Bay State and
on a oromise from Attorney Rosenthal
that liquor would not be served at the
bar dismissed, the case.
Then came Attorney George Knight,
looking out for Gobey's saloon and the
Reception on Sutter street. Knight con
tended that the best people of the town,
men with their families and all who
wanted a little privacy, patronized these
places. Commissioner Newhall said that
he had been In those places, but It was
impossible to tell whether or not the best
people patronized them, as they were
shielded behind the curtains or doers.
Knight tried to get an admission of
knowledge of these saloons from the
Chief, but this was all he obtained:
Mr. Knight â You have been a resident
of San Francisco for a long time and
you are a native son, are you not?
Chief Sullivanâ No; there I draw the
line.
Herbert Choynskl spoke in behalf of the
Columbia cafe, Green Brothers. He con
tended that his business was a restau
rant.
Eddie Wolff played an act or two In
the comedy and got the consent of the
Commissioners for his client to serve a
drink with some substantial refreshment,
not specified.
W. J. Sullivan of the Hoffman spoke
for himself and many other saloon myi
followed him.
Besides this business the Commissioners
appointed Dr. Louis Bazet to be police
surgeon In accordance with the charter.
This will do away with the duties per
formed by Dr. James W. Keeney. who
ranks as a sergeant of police. Chief Sul
livan will notify Dr. Keeney that his
services as surgeon will no longer be re
quired, and as the doctor will not care to
do patrol or station duty as sergeant he
will tender his resignation.
Drill Instructor Andrew J. Gaughran
was appointed a member of the force, aa
the Auditor refused to pass his warrant,
there being no such office provided for
by the Board of Supervisors as drill in
structor. He will probably get one of the
vacancies as sergeant.
Drs. Mahoney and Ten-ill, the' examin
ing physicians under the. pension act,, will
examine to-day, the officers named for re
tirement at the quarterly meeting of thtÂ»
pension board, and the board will meet
next Monday afternoon to take final ac
tion after their report is received.
The Commissioners yesterday morning
decided not to renew the liquor license to
John Brown, proprietor of the Academy
Dance Hall in the basement on the cor
ner of Post street and Grant avenue. This
was the last dance hall on the avenue
with a license, the licenses of the others
having been previously refused.

LEGISLATION ON
FISHING IN SAN
MATEO COUNTY
>
Necessity of Closing Streams
Another Month Is Ques
tioned.
?
On the last day of March, In an article
on the trout streams of California the
fishing expert of The Call commented ad
versely upon the action of the Supervisors
of San Mateo County In passing an or
dinance closing the fishing season until
May 1. It was held that as all the flsh
have spawned by April 1 the closing of the
season is of but little benefit. As none of
the adjoining counties have such a law
confusion to the anglers Is sure to de
velop. The editor of the Coast Advocate
of Halfmoon Bay comes valiantly to the
defense of the Superviors. Unfortunate
ly for him, his argument is weak, as his
various premises are not accurate.
The controvery was submitted by The
Call to John P. Babcock, chief deputy of
the California State Fish Commission and
an authority on the game and food flsh of
the coast. Mr. Babcock supports unquali
fiedly the statements of The Call in an in
teresting communication. He says:
The Coast Advocate Is In error in saying
that the ".Puiisstma Creek [a the most Im
portant trout stream In San Mateo County,
and that It is not surpassed as a fishing
ground by any water in California." The
liirif^irna does not compare favorably as
a fishing stream with the San GregorU, the
Pescadero or the Butana, or their main
tributaries.
The fish in the Pnrisslma- are numerous
but small. An eight-Inch tlsh is a big one
In that stream, and one of ten Inches Is a
"whale." The Purisslma, however. Is one
of the best known streams In San Mateo
County. The wayside inn established some
forty years agoby Richard Dougherty upon
its banks near Its mouth gave it Its repu
tation. "The Purlsglma -House" has no
equal as a stopping place on the coast,' but '
it was. "Dick's" care for travelers and his
wife's cookinz that made it sa attractive.
The flshlrs for small fish was good. They
Wfre of Hne flavor and Mrs. -Dougherty
knew Just how to cook them and just what
to serve with. them. Any one who was so
fortunate as to eat a meal prepared by Mrs.
Douuherty talked of Its excellence for days
alter.
As time went on !t became noised about
that you must have, fished the. Purissima
to know the real Joy of angling, so that at
any time In the early part of the season you
were sure to find congenial sports . there-,
and even though there were no . flsh - over

the PurlMlma. you ; came home .well . con
vinced that flsh do not contribute all of

jret into the Purlsslma and how they main- ;
tain themselves there, for they cannot enter
from the sea, and up to the time of Dick
Dougherty's death a few years ago so far as
Is known the . stream was - never ' stocked
with fish from any other water. Yet year
after year flsh continued -to multiply and

may well believe that Dick was right when
ho used to nay, "You can't flsh 'em all
out."
So far as the writer knows the spawning
reason of the trout in the Purlsslma does
not differ materially from those In other
streams In that county, namely, from De
cember to April. There may be a few that
have not deposited their spawn by April
1, but they are the exception. The em
bryo of next Beacon's spawn is large enough
in April to bÂ» noticeable. This is true ever
of trout that have Just spawned.
- If tSe present close reason for trout was
observtd Ware would be no necessity for a
loneor period in Pan Mateo County. It is
commonly stated that little or no attention
was paid to the closed period in San Mateo
this year. It is even stated that on April
1 there was a well-beaten tmck on both
sides of the San Gregorio and Pescadero
creeks. If the peace officers and the Su
pervisors of San Mateo County would take
uteps to enforce the closed season under the
State law It would be of more benefit to the
streams and the anglers who go there.

FRANK S. DOUTY, who for years
has been identified with the affairs
of the Southern Pacific Company
and corporations connected with it,
died early yesterday morning at the
Homeopathic Hospital in this city. Al
though he had been ailing for the past
five months, he. had shown marked im
provement in his condition and his death
was unexpected. He was a sufferer from
a complication of diseases, which finally
attacked his heart.
"Through his long career as secretary
and manager of the Pacific Improvement
Company he earned an enviable reputa
tion throughout the State and was uni
versally Hked by all who had business or
social dealings with him^
Deceased was born in Piscataquis Coun
ty Maine. September 8, 1847. His father,
Calvin Sanger Douty, was a prominent
man having .been Sheriff of Piscataquis
County for many years Immediately pre
ceding the breaking out of the Civil war,
and served as major, lieutenant - colonel
and ' colonel of the First Maine Cavalry,
meeting his death at the head Â¦Â¦ of his
regiment in a cavalry charge at Aldle in
June, 1862. :-Â¦Â¦Â¦;
The son, although a mere lad, accom
panied his father in the army, serving as
orderly to Colonel Douty.- Upon the death
of his * father Frank entered the naval
academy atAnnapolls. After leaving the
naval school he was engaged in civil en
gineering upon railroads 'in Maine and
in the .Middle West until 1874, when he
came to California. g^fWJLJIgWBiOyWg
Through the influence of his cousin, the
late D. D. Colton, he was given a position
by the Central Pacific Railroad Company,
continuing in that employment for about
a year, 'when he was chosen ' secretary
and treasurer: of the Western-. Develop
ment' Company and later secretary rand
treasurer of ' the ; Pacific . Improvement
Company,'- in which latter position .he
served from 1878 until his death. â¢

ANOTHER RACETRACK VICTIM.
SUPERINTENDENT LEACH of the Mint, in
commenting upon the arrest of Benjamin C.
Bergen upon a charge of stealing gold bullion
from the weighers' department of the institution, is
quoted as saying: "My reasons for suspecting him
were several. His habits were not good. He was a
confirmed card-player, and I also heard that he played
the races."' Here, then, we have what appears
another illustration of the curse of track gambling,
set forth in the person of a young men who had
even.- prospect of an honorable career, and every in
ducement to be faithful to the trust the Government
reposed in him and to the hopes of his family and
Should the charge against Bergen prove to be
true, we will have another link added to the devil's
chain of vice and crime and remorse that has drawn
its dreadful Jength across the community. It will be
another warning of the direful effects of gambling,
and another evidence that hardly any place of busi
ness or any home is safe from the blight of its in
fluence. This new lesson comes timely to revive pub
lic interest in the efforts now being made to spur
the police force on to the suppression of all places
where gambling is practiced. It is through the doors
of these evil dens that men and youths, and not in
fiequently women, enter upon the downward path to
ruin, wretchedness and crime. Can it be that further
lives must be sacrificed in this way before popular
indignation will be sufficiently strong to compel the
authorities to exert the force of the law and close
the doors?
The Call has no desire to make extended comment
upon this case. It directs attention to it solely for
the purpose of making the moral of it clear and plain.
The accused person was suspected because it â¢ was
known that he was a confirmed card-player and be
cause it was reported he played the races. The em
ployers of the city have learned that employes who
indulge in such practices are not safe. The same wis
dom should be learned by the people at large. The
security of business and the happiness of the home
have a common interest in the issue. San Francisco
has been too long a city wide open for the opera
tions of gamblers. The time has come to close it
against them and to keep it closed.
An interesting decision as to what is and what is
not a lunch has been recently made by a Justice
ir. Reading, Pa., to this effect: "Free lunches,
whether by day or night, are unlawful, and
lunches furnished for a nominal consideration
are free lunches. Pretzels, crackers and bits of
one kind of cheese, set out upon the bar or
served to customers with drinks, do not constitute a
lunch; anything beyond or other than pretzels, crack
ers and bits of one kind of cheese constitute a lunch."
Thus a man who has eaten a loaf of bread and a
pound of cheese has not lunched, but if he takes a
ham sandwich it is different.

COMING DOWN FROM HIS PEDESTAL.
THROUGH A SLAUGHTER-HOUSE.
HENRY WATTERSON is the author of the
famous phrase about "marching through a
slaughterhouse to an open grave." He ut
tered it as a warning to his party" against the policy^
of renominating Cleveland in 1892, and it then proved
to be a vain warning, for Cleveland was nominated
and elected. He is now, however, counseling a
course of action which will fulfill the words of his
warning to the letter, for he is actually advocating
the renomination of Bryan and his support by con
servative Democrats who refused to vote for him in
1896.
Watterson's argument on the subject is sufficiently
curious to be worth quoting. He says in a recent
issue of the Louisville Courier-Journal: "If there be
those who do not realize that the money issue in its
old shape is as dead as the institution of African
slavery, and who require 16 to 1 to hold them in line,
16 to 1 shall not in the least frighten us away. In
the matter of expansionâ which will absorb all other
questions â we stand pat upon the fact that 'we done
expanded.' Fifty years hence we shall still be in the
Philippines unless some power turns up strong
enough to put us out. Porto Rico ought to be at
once established as American territory, just as Alaska
is established; just as Hawaii is being established.
Cuba is merely a question of time. . If the Kansas
City convention should adopt an anti-expansion
plank aa radical as might be dictated by Carl Schurz
and Grover Cleveland, and Mr. Bryan should* be
elected, the flag would still wave over the Philippines,
and over Hawaii and Porto Rico, as it waves to-day;
but, instead of an orgy of greed, carpetbaggery, re
divivus, we should administer the new possessions on
Jeffersonian and not on Caesaristic lines. The plat
form ought specifically to say this. But, whether it
does or does not, the result will be the same. No
platform can stay the movement of mankind or im
pede the progress of American arts and arms."
In all that declaration there is nothing of rhyme
and less of reason. It amounts to just this: Bryan is
for free silver and against expansion. It will be im
possible for him to enact a silver bill or to prevent
expansion; therefore, vote for him. Back of such
counsel as that there must be some motive not re
vealed in the counsel itself. Why vote for Bryan if
he can do none of the things he promises to do? Why
support a negative platform and a nullity candidate in
an era of great issues?
The Boston Advertiser, in discussing a movement
going on among the gold Democrats in New Eng
land, makes a statement which throws some light on
the subject. It says a considerable number of old
Democrats who bolted the party in 1896 now pro
pose to return to it, in the belief that Bryan is bound
to be defeated. Â»md that they, if they be then in the
party ranks, will have an opportunity to get to the
front and profit by the reaction against the calamity
leader. If Watterson be one of those who purpose
following that plan, the motive pi his advice will be
apparent, but the matter will remain as unreasonable
as ever.
The money issue is not dead, nor will it be so long
as there is a strong party in the country willing to
support for the Presidency a candidate pledged to
reopen the issue and degrade the currency if the
power.be given him. A Republican Congress has
enacted a sound and safe currency and banking bill,
but a Democratic Congress could repeal it, and were
Bryan President he would use the whole strength of
administration patronage to induce Congress to do so.
To that extent, then, the money issue is still vital.
Bryanism is not so dangerous as it was four year 3
ago, but it is still a menace to the financial and busi
ness interests of the country, and no man who voted
against Bryan then can have any reason for voting
for him now.
quently if the revision be not undertaken a good
many Congressmen who are candidates for re-elec
tion this fall will be called upon by their constituents
to tell the reason why.

THE PORTO RICAN BILL
SENATOR FORAKER in the current number
of the North American Review characterizes
the Porto Rican bill, which has just been
adopted, as a measure designed to give rise to "ques
tions of unusual, far-reaching and world-wide impor
tance." He goes on to say that as a general rule it
is not expedient to enact laws for the mere purpose
of raising questions, but justifies it in this case on the
ground that it will be difficult to devise any compre
hensive policy of dealing with Porto Rico until the
Supreme Court has decided the position which the
people of the island occupy in our governmental
system.
The issue is complex. In the course of the debate
on the bill in the Senate Senator Tillman asked Sena
tor Spooner whether the Porto Ricans are citizens
of the United States, an.d Spooner promptly replied,
"They are not." "Are they aliens?" asked Tillman.
"They are not," said Spooner. "Then,'! said Tillman,
"if they are neither citizens nor aliens, what are
they?" "They are colonists," said Spooner. That
far the questioning went in the Senate and prompt
answers were given. There remains one other ques
tion, What are the rights of colonists of the United
States? That question is the one which the Porto
bill raises, and which Congress passes over to
the Supreme Court.
It will not be long before the question will reach
the court. The New York Herald, in fact, has al
ready taken steps to bring the issue to trial, though
not exactly in a way that will test the constitutional
ity of a tariff upon Porto Rican goods imported into
the United States. The Herald has entered into a
contract with a certain Porto Rican named t Jorge
Cruz and brought him to this country to labor under
the contract. It is said the agreement has been most
carefully drawn, and is beyond all question in viola
tion of what is called the alien contract labor law, in
case the said Cruz is an alien immigrant. It admits of
no doubt that he is an immigrant, in the sense of com
ing to this country for the purpose of carrying out
his contract to labor here, and he has been detained
at Ellis Island and ordered to be deported. The
question to be determine/! is whether he is an alien
or not, and his counsel have applied to the Circuit
Court of the United States for a writ of habeas
corpus.
The presentation of the issue in that way can
hardly, fail to determine the status of Porto Ricans,
for even if the court hold, with Spooner, that the
people of the island are neither citizens nor aliens,
but colonists, it will still have to decide whether
a, colonist is or is not entitled to privileges which are
denied to aliens. Senator Foraker is therefore clearly,
right in saying the bill is designed to raise questions
of world-wide importance, and the trouble is that no
matter how the court decides there is sure to be a
difficult problem of government left.

WAR TAX REVISION.
SECRETARY GAGE, in reply to a request of the
House for information concerning treasury es
timates for the current and the coming fiscal
years, has sent a statement to the effect that for the
current year the revenues from all sources will be
about $560,000,000, and the expenditures $490,000,000,
leaving a surplus of $70,000,000. For the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1901, the estimated revenues will be
$577,000,000, and the expenditures $495,000,000, leav
ing a surplus for that year of $82,000,000. Thus the
estimates are the total surplus of revenue for the two
years will exceed $150,000,000.
On that showing there is certainly ample justifica
tion for those who are now sceeking to bring about
a revision of the war revenue tax at this session of
Congress. The nation is rich and the people are fully
able to pay the existing taxes, but since there is no
longer any need for the whole amount of the revenue
derived from them, the taxes should be diminished as
a mere matter of business. It is a poor economy to
draw money from the channels of trade and industry
for no other purpose than that of locking it up in the
treasury.
The Congressmen who are seeking to have the war
tax revised and reduced at once have a strong sup
port in all parts of the country, and from influential
papers, irrespective of party, for the issue, fortunately,
has not been made a partisan one, either in Congress
or out of it. Thus the Baltimore American, in com
menting upon the resolution of the House asking
for information from the Treasury Department, said:
"If the existing law should be so modified as only
to save the merchants and manufacturers of* the
country the monthly surplus that is now accumulat
ing and lying idle in the treasury, it would have a
tremendous effect on business. One hundred millions
yearly turned back into the channels of legitimate
trade would go far to make a marked increase in our
national prosperity."
The Chicago Record says: "The stamp taxes are
burdensome and should be repealed for that reason.
Fairness to the people requires that taxes levied for
carrying on the war and paid cheerfully because of
that fact should be removed as speedily as possible."
The New York Post says: "The payment of the
premium on the refunded bonds will absorb a large
part of the present surplus, but a new surplus will
accumulate behind it." The Boston Herald says:
"With so much money idle in the treasury vaults, the
circulation is decreased to that extent. Should the Sec
retary deposit it in banks he fears he would be accused
of favoritism." The New York World says: "A fur
ther reason for repealing some of these Â¦ taxes is
found in their discriminating and exasperating na
ture. Last year the Government collected <$43,837,000
from internal revenue stamps. A considerable pro
portion of this amount was realized from stamps on
telegrams and express packages, which it is fair to
assume Congress meant should be paid by the rich
corporations, but which a convenient 'interpretation'
of the law shifted, to the individuals making use of
these conveniences. Nearly all the rest of the
$i 00,000,000 and more of special war taxes i 3 col
lected from the consumption of .the people, in one
form or another."
It is not worth while to^ multiply quotations. The
statement oÂ£ the Secretary shows that the revenue is
largely in excess of the needs of the Government
and the extracts cited attest the public demand for
tax revision. The California: delegation in Congress
are each and all of them specifically ; pledged - to
favor such a revision as will put an end to the am
biguities of the act and prevent the practice of tax
shirking and' extortion on the part of the express
company. They may be counted on. therefore, to
favor revision at once. There are many other Con
gressmen who arc similarly pledged, and consc-
country would like to possess. Any one
who goes there with the idea of engaging
in business must, like all who go to a
new country, take chances. No ona here
can assure an intending business man
that any certain business will ba success
ful.

THE REGULATION OF TELEPHONES.
AMONG the local issues which ought to be
dealt with by the people of California in the
coming campaign is that of providing for an
adequate regulation of telephone corporations, to the
end that the public may no longer be exposed to the
extortions now practiced. T,he need of a regulating
power is felt wherever telephone monopolies exist,
but that need is especially felt in this city and this
State.
The time is approaching when candidates will bs
nominated for legislative offices, and accordingly the
subject should be at once taken up for consideration
in, every Senatorial and Assembly district where tele
phone corporations ply their trade. It is not a par
tisan issue, nor is it a local issue. It is one that con
cerns the community as a whole, and should be acted
upon by the conventions of all parties that put legis
lative tickets in the field. No man should be nomi
nated by either party who does not give to his con
stituents a specific and emphatic pledge to support,
if elected, legislation next winter directed to the end
of providing the desired supervision;
In San Francisco, where the question is of particu
lar importance by reason of the boast of the corpora
tion that if taxed it will put the taxes in the bills
of its patrons, the issue cannot be ignored, even if the
politicians should wish to do so. The popular de
mand for so amending the charter as to give the
municipal authorities power to supervise and control
telephone corporations in the same way as other cor
porations operating public utilities are supervised
will not antagonize any movement toward State con
trol. On the contrary, it will aid and strengthen
such a movement, and consequently the legislative
tickets nominated in this city will be expected to de
clare as emphatically for State supervision as those
nominated elsewhere.
State issues are too often overlooked in the excite
ment of national campaigns. It is therefore impera
tive to press them upon the notice of politicians early
in the canvass. That is the duty which confronts the
people of California at this juncture. The time to
make the fight for good government is now. If the
people are resolute they can readily obtain from all
candidates for the Senate or the Assembly clear and
explicit pledges on this issue, for the need of some
regulation upon the telephone monopoly is a matter
about which there can be no dispute among intelli
gent and honest men. The subject, therefore, should
be taken up throughout the State by men of all par
ties. Let us have the wrong of telephone extortion
and tax shirking righted when the next Legislature
meets.

slons are due to the hasty opinions of
critics and to the manner In which this
superb masterpiece â a flower of national
life â has been translated.
The amu3ins romances of roguery In
imitation of the manner of Lazarillo de
Sormes are utterly unlike "Don Quixote."
The comic episodes* are related with an
air of grandiloquence which gives a flavor
to them so quaint and humorous that it is
as impossible to translate them as it is to
put Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn"
or "David Harum" into French. Never
theless "Don Quixote" is delightful, even
when inadequately translated. It is as
much a no\el of character aa "The New
comes" is a novel of character. No culti
vated Spaniard could give high place to
the preceding light romantic sketches
after he had read this chief work of the
golden age of Spain. His satire against
pretended poets. "The Voyage of Parnas
sus," ranks next to "Don Quixote" ; it Is a
beautiful poem, but it is. like Tennyson's
"Princess," at times both serious and
ironical, and there are passages in which
the author docs not seem to know whether
he means to be serious or ironical. Of his
many plays, he mentions especially these:
"The Captives of Alders.' "Numantia"
and "The Naval Engagement." "I made
an attempt to reduce the comedies of four
acts to three: I was the first to repre
sent the phantoms of the imagination and
the hidden thoughts of the soul by intro
ducing figures of them upon the stage;
I composed during this period from
twenty to thirty dramas, all of which
were represented without a single cucum
ber or orange, or any other missile usually
aimed at bad comedians, being .thrown at
the actors."
In the succeeding time of Calderon. the
greatest of all Spanish poets, the theater
became as luxurious in Its apparatus ait
In our day. - Calderon followed the exam
ple of Cervantes and introduced abstract
qualities in human guise Into his "autos."
In "The True God Pan." "The Vineyard
of the Lord." "The Enchantments of
Sin." "The Brazen Serpent" and dozens
of others, sin. taste, touch, smell are per
sonified, as Shakespeare personifies Hy
men at the end of "As You Like It." "
Of CaJderon's many plays. "The Won
derful Magician" is the best known. Shel
ley translated fine passages. Edward Fltz
Gerald and Denis Florence MacCarthy
have likewise translated It. "The Devo
tion of the Cross" Is so terrible and
gloomy and vet so exalted a drama that
St has excited the censure of Sismondi and
other critics, who Insist that It and "The
Physician of His Own Honor" are unfit
for presentationâ as unfit, som* of th*Â»
English rritlcs say. as the "One!" of
Shelley. But these dramas are great works
of literature, and no reader who alms for
culture can afford to neglect them. With
them the golden age of Spanish literature
reached Us height. ThÂ» "autos" â thÂ«
splendidly mounted religious "acts"
played at the court of Philip IV or In thÂ«
plazas before great palaces on feast days
âwill rÂ«Â»pay study. The best translation
of the most Important of them is by the
late Denis Florence MacCarthy. Cer
vantes. Calderon and Lope de Vega w<?r<?
friends. Calderon dramatized "Don
Quixote": having been a soldier. hÂ» be
came nt last a priest, while remaining a
poet. He died In ISSlâ on May 2TÂ»â revered,
beloved and honored. Great names crowd
the epoch of Spain's splendor, hut none Is
so great as that of any one of thess three.

SCHOOL BOARD
TAKES CONTROL
OF JANITORS
Demands of Superintendent
Webster Finally Com- .
plied With.
Investigation of a Teacher Illegally
Granted a CertificateâUnsani
tary Condition of Emerson
Primary School.
>
The Board of Education yesterday re
ceded from its position In its controversy
with Superintendent Webster regarding
the payment of school Janitors by practi
cally reasaumlng control over them. Reso
lutions were adopted whereby the action
of the Board of Public Works In recently
dismissing thirteen Janitors and appoint
ing others to take their places was af
firmed. Six other Janitors were trans
ferred and the resignations of two were
accepted, action on them having likewise
been taken by the- Board of Works. In
this way Superintendent Webster's objec
tions to signing the Janitors' demands, be
cause the State law provides that the
School Board has absolute control over
Its employes, have been satisfied, and as
soon as he receives official communica
tion that the board has by resolution re
appolnted the Janitors originally selected
by the Board of Works he will sign their
salary demands.
The board decided to take under advise
ment the following report of Superintend
ent Webster In the case of a teacher who
was granted an illegal renewal of her cer
tificate after It had expired: .
Investigation has revealed the fact that in
1592 a special certificate to teach French In
the public schools of this city and county
was Issued to Mrs. R C. Clifford upon an ex
pired certificate originally Issued to her In
1875. This act was Illegal. It becomes my
duty to notify the board of the foregoing facts
In order that section 1701 of the Political Code
of this State may be compiled with.
Walter S. Brann's leave of absence was
extended until August 5. 1900.
Inspector of Buildings Wellln was di
rected to investigate the report of the
Health Board regarding the unsanitary
condition of the Emerson Primary School.
The teachers of French were excused
from attendance on April 16, 17, IS, 19, 20
and 23 In order to permit them to attend
lectures by Professor de Regnler at the
University of California.
The sum of $10 was allowed monthly for
ohyslcal training of the girls In the Poly
technic High School.

BERGEN ARRAIGNED IN
THE FEDERAL COURTS
Superintendent I/each of the Mint
Thanks Chief Sullivan for Ef
fecting the Arrest.
Benjamin Bergen, weigher at the Mint,
who was arrested for stealing gold bul
lion, was brought before United States
Commissioner Heacock yesterday morn
ing and identified as being the person
named in the warrant. Bail was fixed at
$2000, and April 19 at 2 p. m. was set as
the date of the preliminary examination.
Superintendent Leach of the Mint called
upon Chief Sullivan yesterday morning
and thanked him for effecting Bergen's
capture through Detectives Ryan and
O'Dea. which he had already reported to
Washington. He had given due credit to
the Police Department In his report,
which was the more praiseworthy, as he
had had private detectives on the case
for some time without any result.
Wells for Mayor.
PORTLAND, April U.â The Democrats
to-day nominated Dr. George M. Wells for
Mayor.
and romances that were neither verse nor
prose, encouraged his taste for the litera
ture of the imagination. At 23 he had no
profession and no income. He wrote the
pastoral romance "Filena." Life and the
activities of life delighted him. He start
ed off, after the manner of his time, for
the "wander year," which was to prove a
"wonder year" of great length for him.
People were kind to poor traveling stu
dents in those days. "If you give to learn
ing." as the Spanish proverb says, "you
give to God." Earlier St. Francis d Asslsl
made his monks not tread on a piece of
written paper, for, as it was the work
of a learned man, it might contain the
name of God; and even if the learned
man who wrote It were a pagan, it might
hold the letters that make up the name of
God.
Until he reached Italy Cervantes was
treated by high and lowâ particularly by
the lowâ as one of those learned human
letters that might one day add to the
greater glory of God. Cardinal Acquarria
became his patron at Rome. Shortly after
this he dropped the pen and took up the
sword. The Turks were threatening
Europe and the African corsairs forced
Spain to be on guard. In 1572 occurred
the battle of Lepanto, in which Don Juan
of Austria saved Christendom and in
which Cervantes lost part of an arm. An
Aigerine pirate seized him on his way
home. For eight years he was a slave,
and it Is assumed that his picturesque ro
mance, "The Captives," Is founded on his
exile in Africa. After 1581. when he was
ransomed, he wrote "Galatea." an idyl, a
pastoral romance; almost as sweet as "As
You Like It" and quite as moral. It had
a great success. Lope de Vega, the Inde
fatigable dramatist, came Into high favor,
though Philip II kept the gloomy eye of
intolerance on all things. And Cervantes,
Impressed with his own power as a play
wright, entered the lists against him.
This Lope Felix de Vega Carplo was a
native of Sladrid. He had been left while
young an orphan without means, but he
was of good blood. His education was un
finished. Don Geronymo Manrlque. the
Bishop of Avila and grand inquisitor, sent
him to Avila to complete his education.
At this university he obtained his bacca
laureate degree. He was for a time secre
tary to the Duke of Alva. He married,
fought a duel, almost killed his opponent
and when he was allowed to return to
Madrid his wife died. Full of national
pride, inflamed by the treatment of Cath
erine of Aragon by the father of Eliza
beth, and anxious to avenge that Insult to
the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella,
ho joined the Spanish armada. He reached
Spain after the wreck of Spain's hopes
and married again. After a period of
great happiness his second wife died. He
became a priest and devoted himself en
tirely to the composition of poetry- His
dramas caught the taste of the Spanish
people. They adored him; he could not
walk in the streets of Madrid without
being surrounded by crowds of admirers.
Pope Urban VIII made him a doctor of
theology and a Knight of Malta: honors
of all sorts were showered upon him.
Managers of theaters, fought for his
pieces while he , was writing them. "They
could hardly wait until the sheets were
dry. He was not of the classical school:
he was as romantic and untrammeled as
Shakespeare: and Racine, Co rnellle, or
that most stringent of critics, Voltaire,
could have. no sympathy with him. The
people said, he said; it was his business
to please the people. ' He was always
poetic, no matter how hastily he wrote,
and for this reason the poetic Spanish

STUDENT PLAY WILL
CONTINUE ALL WEEK
Proceeds to Assist IT. C Track Team
to Make Expected Trip to
the East.
"James Wobberta," the student play at
the Grand Opera-house, has . taken the
popular fancy, and as a consequence the
University of California management has
decided to continue It throughout the
week. The minstrel performance, which
was to hold the boards for the remainder
of the week, will not be entirely supplant
ed. The best features and several musical
numbers by glee, banjo and mandolin
clubs will be presented In the first part of
the evening, and the curtain will go up
on 'James Wobberts" after an hour of
musical entertainment. "James Wob
berts" was originally presented with a
curtain-raiser. The musical entertainment
will take the place of this, making the
total length of the Bhow about three
hours.
ThÂ© Innate strength and humor of "James
\Y obberts" has more than made up for the
lack of reputation of playwright and com
pany. The audiences have been larger
and more appreciative each succeeding
night. In a somewhat revised version
"James Wobberts" has been copyrighted
and it will be put upon the road within a
month under the name of "A Perfect
Devil." The venture has secured good
financial backing and the "Perfect Devil"
company will tour the coast. The com
pany will Include some of the student am
ateurs, but professionals will be engaged
for the leading characters.
The remaining performances of univer
sity week are a benefit to the fund for the
Eastern trip of the California track team.
The San Francisco High Schools, which
annually send large delegations to the
State University, have put their shoulders
to the wheel, and the matinee Saturday
afternoon will be held under their aus
pices. The double bfll begins to-night and
continues until Sunday.

New Steamer Robert Dollar
Has Her Trial Trip w
on the Bay.
Goes From Here to Puget Sound,
Where She Will Be Fitted Out
for the Oape Nome
Trade.
s
Another fine steamer was added to the
Cape Nome fleet yesterday. The Robert
Dollar had her Initial trial trip on the
bay and proved herself to be a fast and
speedy vessel. Over the measured mile
she exceeded eleven knots an hour, and
as soon as her machinery 1b in perfect
working order it is expected she will make
fully twelve knots an hour.
The Robert Dollar was built at Gray's
Harbor and engined in San Francisco. She
is 203 feet long, 38 feet beam and 15 feet
deep. She was towed here from Grays
Harbor, and brought down the largest
load of lumber that ever passed out over
the Grays Harbor bar. She was fitted
here with triple expansion engines and
Babcock & "Wllcox boilers, and is now
classed as Al in every respect.
The Dollar was to have had her official
trial trip yesterday, but the officials from
the engine shop were not ready, so Robert
Dollar, the managing owner, gave his
friends and. Invited guests a trip around
the bay. ;
The Robert Dollar will leave here for
Seattle on Saturday. On her arrival in the
Sound she will be built up and passenger
accommodations provided for 800 gold
hunters. After the rush to Nome is over
Bhe will come back to San Francisco and
go into the coasting trade.
Two More New Steamers.
The steamer W. H. Kruger, built for the
Truckee Lumber Company, also had her
trial trip on the bay yesterday. She will
carry 450.000 feet of lumber and will run
between here and Tillamook.
â¢> The steamer Nome City, built at Eu
reka, left that place !n tow of the tug
Rescue for San Francisco yesterday. On
her arrival here she will be engined and
put in the Cape Nome trade.
Harbor Commissioners Meet.
The contract for repairing slip No. 4 was
let by the Harbor Commissioners yester
day to James McMahon for $1344 75. The
contract for the repavlng of the spaces at
the north and south ends of the ferry de
pot was let to the City Street Improve
ment Company at 7T4 cents per square
foot, while the cesspools are to cost $24 75
each. Newson & McNeil wrote to the
board complaining that they had been de
layed In their Job at the north end of the
ferry by the State officials, and that ow
ing to the advance In carpenters' wages
they were out of pocket $240. They asked
the board to repay them that amount. A
similar complaint was received from
James McMahon In regard to his work at
Spear street. He asked for $155 damages.
Both requests will be acted upon when
the contracts are completed.

loved him. "According to his own testi
mony." Herr Bouterwek says, "he wrote
on an average five sheets a day; It has
therefore been computed that the number
of sheets which he composed during his
life must have amounted to 123.225 and
that allowing for the deduction of a small
portion of prose. Lope de Vega must have
written upward of 21.300,000 verses." His
theatrical profits were so great that he
became a rich man. He gave away money
generously, but to the end of his life he
could have lived luxuriously if he would.
He did not create the Spanish drama, but
he fixed its form and spirit.
The word "comeclia" (comcdy> In Span
ish must not be taken to mean a light,
satirical play of manners, with a mar
riage or several marriages at the end. It
was a play of Intricate plot, surprising
adventure, puzzling Intrigue. Its story

historical, heroic; it might e%en be a bur
lesque. In fact. It might cover as many
qualities as our own now does. It was
divided into the sacred and temporal
dramaâ divine and human comedies; the
temporal comedies were called "heroic"
or "of the cloak and sword" (capa y es
pada). The latter answered to our mod
ern idea of the comedy of manners,
though there was r.o limit to the Intri
cacy of the plot or the number of adven
tures. Lope wrote over 2000 original plays.
Including the dramatized lives of the
saints and the sacramental acts (Autos
Sacramentales). which were a species by
themselves. Against this dramatic prod
igy. Cervantes entered the lists. Ha
failed. Of the thirty plays he WTOte In
competition with Lope only his tragical
play of "Numantla" and "Life in Algiers"
are remembered.
He began, after hi 3 marriage, his series
of "Instructive Novels" (Novelas Exem
plares), of which good translations may
be found In the Bonn library, and these
were well received. Imprisoned at La
Mancha, owing to some difficulty not re

XV. CERVANTES AND THE GOLD
EN AGE OF SPANISH LIT- â¢
ERATURE.
BY MAURICE FRANCIS EGAN, LL. D.
Miguel da Cervantes Saavedra was born
at Alcala de Henares in the year 1547. He
died in the same year as Shakespeare â
1616. He appeared at a fortunate time; the
Spaniardsâ the Spanish literature was
much more Influenced by the tastes and
prejudices of the people than by the rigid
rules of an aristocratic groupâ were weary
of the constant imitation of Italian
models. There bad even been one or two
who had dared to disregard the classical
axioms of Aristotle's "Poetics" and to in
sist that a literature should not only ex
press personality and nationality, but that
it should discard, a foreign mold.
In one sense both Cervantes and Lope de
Vega (1562-1625) found the ground prepared
for them. It was fertilized by the debris
of many works. And the three greatest
names of the golden age of Spanish liter
atureâCervantes, Lope de Vega and Cal
deron (1600-16S1)â blazed out. not from
darkness, but from the lesser glow of
many inferior lights. D-vnte, as Rossettl
points out In his remarkable book, "Dante
and His Bride," was one of a group, and
his predecessors made the way for him;
so Cervantes was not the first to cast
aside that slavish Imitation of Italian
models which had so long hurt the vitality
of Spanish literature. A stuÂ«y of the his
tory of Spanish literature will show that
it owes little to kings. It was as much a
reflection of the national spirit as the lit
erature of the Elizabethans was of na
tional tendencies and aspirations. Kings
repressed, and the Inquisition Itselfâ which
the state controlledâ fought against the
secular spirit of the drama, which the
Spaniards loved with all their hearts.
Against the love of this proud, passionate,
religious and patriotic people for literary
and dramatic expression the opposition of
kings and of the inquisition was vain.
There was never any antagonism between
religion and the Spanish literary expres
sion; there was an antagonism at times
between state ecclestastlcism and the de
termination of the people not to submit
literary expression to too rigid a censor
ship.
Lope de Rueda had written dramas in
the Castlllan speech, and these, in a the
ater quite as rough as the town hall at
Stratford-on-Avon i of Shakespeare's boy
hood, Cervantes had seen at Madrid. It
was to this city that he had been sent by
hls parents, who were poor and ambitious,
to pick up such learning as he could. He
studied Ovid and Virgil, of course, and his
preceptor, Juan Lopez, who wrote verses

It was appointed by State Superintendent
of Schools Kirk, President Wheeler of the
University of California and President
Jordan of Stanford, and is composed of a
score of prominent educators of the State.
The object of the gathering Is to discuss
educational topics and changes in legisla
tion connected with school affairs.
Among the subjects which will be
brought up for discussion are the follow
ing: Firstâ That high school certificates
be granted without examination and on
presentation of proper credentials from
accredited institutions. Secondâ That the
State Superintendent of Public Schools be
selected by a committee of prominent ed
ucators Instead of being elected, as at
present.
Considerable opposition will develop
against both propositions.' The doing
away with examinations for high school
teachers, It is held by the opponents of
the plan, will result In the selection of
teachers from the University of California
only, which Is alone recognized by the
statute. Two years devoted to the study
of pedagogy In that institution will bo
sufficient, for high school certificate re
quirements if the new plan is put in op
eration. -;â¢Â¦:--. - â¢Â¦â¢-"...Â¦â¢
To place the selection of the State Su
perintendent in the hands of a committee,
it is argued, will cause even a worse sys
tem of politics than ever and is objection
able on that ground.
Superintendent T. J. Kirk is chairman
of the committee. The other members are
Superintendent J. W. McClymonds of
Oakland, Professor E. P. Cubberley of
Stanford. Superintendent J. W. Linscott
of Santa Cruz. R. M. Shackelford of Paso
Robles, Superintendent Robert Furlong of
San Rafael, Professor E. E. Brown of
Berkeley and G. W. Beattie of Berkeley.
The programme of subjects as prepared
by the committee is as follows: Certifica
tion of teachers, time for selecting school
trustees and electing teachers, governing
Board of State Normal Schools and re
quirements for admission, concentration
and consolidation of county school dis
tricts and the transportation of pupils.
WARNER'S .REMEDIES.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 1900.
In the. country. The right thus conferred la a
valuable one, to be taken away by the courts
only upon clear proof that the holder has
committed some act which would deprive him
of the privilege of remaining in the United
States.
The certificate makes out a urima facia case
in behalf of the right to remain. _To overcome
the presumption arising from the possession of
the certificate the testimony ; should be clear
and convincing, and until the Government has
made out such a case the holder of the certi
ficate Is not required to make further proof.
In the case now before Judge do Haven
If Is conceded that See Ho How has a
valid certificate, that he has resided in
San Jose for nearly twenty years and that
he has not left the United States during
that period. The action of United States
Commissioner James in thi3 matter is un
favorably commented upon by United
States District Attorney Coombs, Assist
ant District Attorney Banning, Internal
Revejjue Agent Hurt Thomas and many
other Federal officials. The District At
torney says that he was not notified of
the arrest of the Chinaman, and that he
learned of It by accident. It was the duty
of the Commissioner to notify the Unitea
States Attorney. The complaint was
made by W. A. Soto, not a Government
official, and Mr. Soto could not be found
either here or in San Jose when Mr. Ban
ning desired him as a witness. He was
informed that Soto was a laboring man
who spent all his leisure time in hanging
around a cigar store and playing cards
Mr. Banning says further that it is not
customary for Commissioners to issue
warrants in such cases upon complaints
made by persons not Federal officers

NEW YORK. April 11.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
There was scarcely any business in the markets
here to-day excepting closing the books before
the holidays. The tone was dull on the tight
ness of money and Impatience with the Inac
tion of General Roberts. Americans were
heavy from the start, but there was little
movement in them until the afternoon, when
they broke sharply on New York sales, clos
ing decidedly weak. The only stock New York
supported was Baltimore and Ohio, which Lon
don now avoids, regarding the stock as en
tirely under Speyer control.
No gold was taken or received. The bank
did a large business In loans at 5 per cent for
the week. It is using loan money for discount
ing six months' paper. This is unpopular with
the market, as It means keeping money tight.

Nczi' York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 11.â The reactionary ten
dency which developed In the stock market
yesterday continued manifest during the early
hours to-day when the selling was active and
widely distributed and seemed quite urgent In
come stocks. About midway of the session,
however, the pressure to sell was Homewhat
relaxed end friends of the various stocks took
them In bond and bid them up. The advance
in these Ktocks was not mat by any great
l/urdon of offerings and prices generally tended
toward recovery. The rally in prices failed to
bring in any notable demand for stocks and
the market >cÂ«mc rather heavy again and
closed in that condition. Dealings were very
largely In professional hanflÂ« and the efforts
of the bears to force down prices and dislodge
step-loss orders met with considerable success
In some quarfre. The character of the buy
ing at the decline Indicated that commission
houses have orders to buy at varying levels
below the market. There was no appearance
cf last week's <2is;K>altion on the pert of the
outside }>Ã¼bllc lo buy at the market. Prices
at Americans v.-rre depressed In London before
the opening here, but the level of the market
fell Ijelow the London parity and nrbltruge
brokers bought ' stocks to cover sales at the
higher level in London. This buying was
Â«t}>Â«c.lal!y large in l.'nion l'aclflc when that
ettx-k eot Ijclotv v". tnd was a material aid
to its late rally of over 2 points, with a
sympathetic efrÂ«-rt on the Pacifies and In less
upjrme on the whole market. Baltimore and
Ohio preferr<^J and Louisville and Nashville
showed aggressive strength and Missouri Pa
rlfic rallied well from the morning's decline.
Otherwise the railroad .list was rather quiet
nnJ sluggish. The most violent movements
as usual, were among the Industries and
specialists. The fact that Third Avenue stork
(.tilt commanded a premium for use In the
stock lonn department last night showed that
the Fhort interest had not been entirely elim
inated by yesu-rday'ts violent rise. An active
riwculation resulted In the stock anil It wa*
forced up at one time 9 points, then collapsed
11 points and rallied again 5 points. The net
pain was 2 points. The public was not In
formed In detail of the plan for rehabilitating
the property and the ni"-Â»ment of the stock
v.-as governed by the necessities of the shorts.

The Money Supply.
Henry Clews' New York circular says: "AH
Indications point to a continued good active
market for some time to come. The most
eerlous Impediments were the April settle
ments. These have been safely passed and
easy money ie practically assured for the next
three or four months. The amount of money
in clrculctlon on April 1. according to Gov
ernment returns, was $2,021,274,000. an increase
of J!'3.427.0tÂ»Â» over the same time last year.
Nearly $20,000,000 of this increase wan In the
month of March; a considerable portion of
vhlch. it is safe to presume, was the result
of the new currency bill, enabling national
banks to issue notes to the par value of their
l>or.<ls. A further addition to the volume of
currency Is to be anticipated from this meas
ure: but there is no prospect of the ridiculous
estimates put out by 6ome parties, who should
know better, being realized : and our estimate
Â«f about J100.000.000 durinp the first year still
seems likely to be an outside figure. Continued
demand from out-of-town banks recently to
retire circulation lias brought the aggregate
of bucli deposits at the sub-treasury within
S3OG.GOO of the April limit. Tills is unusually
early in the month for the $3,000,000 limit to
be reached, and signifies that interior Institu
tions *cc greater profit in selling their bonda
at current prices than keeping out circulation
en the uncertainty of having it profitably em
ployed. At present there are no signs of
Ftrlnpency in sipht. and money Is as easy in
the West as in the East In spite of great trade
activity. As Just said, this is an Important
factor in the stock market, for it permits
numerous large speculative operations which
had hitherto been held in check."

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. April 11.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter,, will -say Â¦ to-morrow: There
has . been more . looking around for wool on
the part of manufacturers, several of whom
are evidently getting ready to buy some stocks
and there Is on the whole a better tone to
the market. \ The volume of business actually
transacted Is still very moderate, for the rea
son that In a number of Instances holders of
wool were unwilling to meet the views of the
consumers. While the wool market cannot as
yet be -quoted as actually higher the down
ward tendency which previously characterized
It seems to have been arrested for the time
being at any rate and a comparatively firm
feeling prevails. Advices from the Interior In
dicate a very firm feeling and the Idea of
holders of wool are In many Instances con
siderably above the level of the seaboard mar
kets. The sales of the week In Boston amount
ed to 2,929,400 pounds domestic and 853,600 for
eign, making a total of 3.692.900, against a
total of 2,714,000 for the previous week and a
total of 7,925,500 for the corresponding week
last year. The sales since January 1 amount
to 47.421,900 pounds, against 67.003,800 pounds
for the corresponding time last year.

CHICAGO. April 11.â The wheat market
opened active and strong under the Influence
of the Government report putting the condi
tion at Â£2.1 per cent, considerably lower than
had been expected and the cold weather In
the Southwest, May %@%c over yesterday at
67%067vfcc. Shorts covered and May advanced
to 68VÂ»c. The crowd, however, was against
the market. Long stuff came out and the
price was forced down slowly to" 67% c. The
close was barely steady. May a shade over
yesterday at C~ l A>q6~%c. Cables were not en
couraging and many on the. floor held that
the cold weather would have little If any
effect. The caÂ«h demand was poor.
The 'Ftory of wheat might be written of
corn. The opening was strong and active and
the bulge met liquidation and a poor cash
demand. The wheat statement and the bad
weather In sections of the corn-growing belt
were the factors early. The market closed In
a weak condition, with May %Â®%c under yes
terday.
Provisions were active, but depressed ' de
spite a good outside demand. Hogs were
weaker and receipts were liberal. Liquidation
by Influential longs was kept up during the
entire session an<l did much to lower prices.
May pork closed 4."ii?'47%c under yesterday: May
lard, 12%i915c depressed, and May ribs 15@17%c
lower. . f
Oats advanced early In sympathy with other
grains. May reacted under the common Im
pulse, but July, held steady on reports of late
seeding and a poor crop outlook.

Good Work by a Traveling Man.
A traveling man, Mr. Julius C. Meyer
of 175 Fairlawn street, Cleveland, has
cured a number of his friends of stom-
ach troubles, dyspepsia, bowel com-
plaints, etc., by urging the use of Grape-
Xuts breakfast food. He says:
"A business man, a friend of mine,
was'so run down that he left his busi-
ness several months becaust he could
not eat enough to supply the strength
required to work. After spending hun-
dreds of dollars in journeys to mineral
springs for baths, in medicines, atten-
dants, etc., without success. I recom-
mended Grape-Xuts food, and at the
end of thirty days he told me he .never
enjoyed a better appetite, was never
more energetic or felt more like work
than then. This change came around
entirely by reason of his leaving off the
ordinary food and using principally
Grape-Xuts at his meals. He said he
would not be without the food at a dol-
lar a pound.
"A lady friend of my wife was suffer-
ing so with dyspepsia that she was com-
pelled to give up her work as no food
would ftay on her stomach for five
minutes. The doctors told her there
was no hope for her ever enjoying food
of any kind. She started in on Grape-
Xuts and used nothing else for about
three months, when she was com-
pletely cured and ready to attend to her
business. She takes Grape-Nuts with
her every day. She said to my wife,
'Had it not been for you and Grape-
Nuts I surely would have died. I shall
never forget your kindness to me.'
"In my own family we have used the
food for about a year, constantly, and
have all enjoyed better health since its
introduction. It has done us more good
than we ever expected to get from a
food."
There js a deep, underlying reason
why Grape-Nuts food cures people of
dyspepsia and builds them up into a
fine condition of health and, strength.
Certain principles are abstracted from
the grains and made up into the food
known as Grape-Nuts, producing a
powerful, concentrated food that gives
certain and well-defined . results. Â¦ Ths
proof is in the eating. There are hun-
dreds of thousands of people tnat can
give testimony regarding the strength-
ening properties of this famous food.

shot he has not been prominent at the

pearance In the event which means the

Of the Californlas, Clarence Nauman
killed twenty- four out of twenty-five in
the first round, shooting from the same
mark as Bates, the ultimate winner. Tho

resentative of California, does not appear
among those of the men who missed but
one bird.
Eight men killed twenty-five straight
and then settled down to shooting off the
tie for premier position. As they missed
a bird they retired. The competition fin
ally dwindled down to Bates and J. R.
Malone. Each grassed his birds In turn
until the thirty-fourth round. Bates kill
ed a straightaway driver, while Malone
failed to .stop a towering driver, which
sailed away for parts unknown. The

friends of the dead banker insist that ana

ineie was no premeditation in Pitcher's
The faci that Pitcher did not send
a lir.e of nietssge to his wife with the in
cloture is one circumstance that further
clouds wlin mystery the story of the
linancier's death. That even the most
commonplace message from husband to
wife should have been omitted in this last
communication, even on the brink of the
grave, is deemed one of the strange incl
aentÂ« surrounding the. suicide. Tho
Pitchers bad studiously avoided for a Hng
time any action which would have led to
comment on their domestic relations. That
theie was trouble between the couple is
a certainly, but an open breach had not
been manifest. Until Mrs. Pitcher and her
daughters went to Berkeley, six weeks
age. to reside the family dwelt together.
Tnc intimates of the Pitchers profess
amazement that there should be a public
suggestion of disturbances. But through
out the town there runs a strong under
current of rumor that all had not been
well. This, however. Is not taken as hav
ing had any bearing upon the death of
the bank manager.
Mrs. Pitcher declared positively to
night that there was absolutely, no cause
within her knowledge which wouid have
led her husband to take his life. She had
relied upon the statements to her from
friends that he was temporarily insane
when h" f^hot himself.
MattfTP at the bank resumed somewhat
of a normal condition to-day. There were
a few more disturbed depositors to with
draw their funds, but the official notice
from the Hank Commissioners' secretary,
C. H. Dunsmoor, that there were ample
funds to meet all demands checked the
rush for gold. Until affairs become morÂ«
settled Charles G. Reed will remain in
charge. The selection of a permanent

EX-CORONER HILL WINS
ON A TECHNICALITY
Withheld Jewelry of a Murdered
Woman, but Her Husband
Cannot Recover It.
A decision was rendered yesterday by
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan in favor of
ex-Coroner Hill In a suit brought against
the latter official by John Tracy, husband
of the woman who was murdered in a
Turk-street lodging-house recently by
Paul Debauge. Tracy sued for $130 worth
of jewelry, which he claimed to be com
munity property and which Hill refused
to surrender. Tracy testified that he had
given the jewelry 10 his wife as a token
of love and affection and on that show-
Ing Justice Kerrigan was obliged to decide
against him, as the law holds that such
gifts are the personal property of the
wife.
It developed that Tracy raised $40 to
pay his wife's funeral expenses of $70 and
the difference, $30. was to have been sup
plied by Hill, who was to keep the jewel
ry as security. Tracy went East shortly
after and on his return was presented
with a bill for the $30 by the undertaking
company. He could get no satisfaction
from Hill.
The ex-Coroner has entered the words,
"Sold for funeral expenses," opposite the
Morgue records of the murdered woman's
belongings and In doing so Mr. Morgan

and soon they had .taken out the skull and
the greater part of the skeleton of a large
prehistoric mammal. Some of the teeth
which had become detached were also
taken out. The skeleton's parts were
loaded on two sleds and carried to Atlin.
where they were placed on exhibition in
the: Government offices.
They are to be sent out to Curator Fan
nln of the British Columbia Museum at

bones of the skeleton are of Immense size,
the tibia being larger 'than that of an

TO THE PRESIDENCY

Seek the Man and He Will Not
Run Away.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 11.â General Miles
said to-night that the mention of his
name in connection with the Presidential
nomination was unauthorized.
"I have not asked any one," he said, "to
advocate my nomination, nor have I de
clined to have my name used. I consider
the Presidency of the United States the
most exaÂ»ied station on earth. It Is an
honorable ambition for any man to aspire
to be worthy and competent to fill. There
are many men in this country who would
fill all the requirements of the place and
perform all its duties with ability, intelli
gence and honor. I think the Intelligence
and patriotism of the country should seek
out the man for the Presidency rather
than that the man should seek the place."
It is well known to his close friends
that General Miles has received a large
number of letters from all parts of the
country expressing the desire that he al
low his name to be used in connection
with the Presidential nomination, but hÂ«
has refrained from acting upon these sug
gestions.

MARION WELLS
TO BE TURNED
FROM HIS HOME
The Sculptor Finds Himself
in Great Financial Dif

Loses His Fortuns Backing Carlos
Ezeta for the Presidency of the
Republic of San Sal
vador.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, April 11.
Only a counter legal act to-day prevent
ed F. Marion Weils, the sculptor who de
signed the *tatuo of Justice tin San Fran
cisco's new City Hall, from being turned
out of his home and into the street. The
holder of a title to Mr. Wells' home In
Berkeley to-day secured a writ of eject
ment for Wells, and Constable J. C. Wil
liiiir.son was only prevented from serving
it by an injunction' which wns secured in
behalf of Mr. Wells.
Wells at one time ranked as one of the
leading sculptors of Kan Francisco and
Â¦was possessed of considerable wealth. He
purchased a handsome home in Berkeley,
fitted it up without regard to expense and
lavished money upon the grounds.
Then Wells became interested in the
fate of Carlos Kzeta and espoused the
cause of the banished President of San
Salvador. So Interested did he become in
his prospects that he advanced Kzeta a
considerable amount of money. When
Ezeta failed to secure either the Presi
dency or his property Wells lost a great
deal of money.
So badly did this loss cripple Wells that
he found it necessary to mortgage his
Berkeley home to a San Franciscan b>
the name of Lawrence. Lawrence has
Eince died, and now Wells find^ himself in
the position of being unable to meet either
the principal or the interest on the loan,
and the mortgage has been foreclosed.
But Wells did not leave his home, even
though he had lost it, and he found him
telf unable to meet even the rent demand
ed by Lawrence's executors, who to-day
took steps to dispossess him. . â¢

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALI!,' THURSDAY, APRIL, 12. 1900.
HIS PLEA FOR A
LIGHT SENTENCE
DID NOT AVAIL
Footpad Fonte Sent to Fol
som Penitentiary for
Twelve Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway. April 11.
"I was led away by bad associates. All
I ask you for Is a light sentence because
of my youth. I promise to do better tn
the future." This was Thomas 11. Fonte's
plea for leniency when he was called be
fore Judge Greene to-day for sentence on
his plea of gnilty of robbery.
Immediately after the last plea for
clemency the court pronounced a sentence
upon Fonto of twelve years* imprisonment
In Folsom.
Before sentence was pronounced Attor
ney C. P. Stevens made a speech, urging
clemency, but his Honor suggested that
Fonte himself could with better grace be
heard In his own behalf.
As soon as the young highwayman, act
ing on. the cue, had delivered his few
words, Judge Greene queried the prisoner,
who answered that he had good parents,
had been well advised, but had been led
away.
"Well, you do not appear very much
troubled over the matter, or hav^ you
shed your tears in private?" questioned
the Judge.
"Ye.Â«, sir." replied the prisoner. "I was
so much nff>cted by the' disgrace brought
on my family that I tried to commit sui
cide."
Judge Greene made some Inquiry about
Fonte s past, telling the f not pail, however,
that he was not bound to answer. Attor
ney Stevens objected to a query whether
the young robber had ever been arrested
before. This blocked evidence concerning
his connection with a safe robbery In Col
orado.
Fonte was a member of a gang of high
waymen who terrorized Oakland, being
responsible for half a dozen hold-ups,
during one of which J. F. Thomas, a West
Oakland saloon-keeper, was murdered.
Hesldes himself, William J. Downing and
Edward Scott confessed to one of th# rob
beriesâthat of Peter Chrlstensm at his
saloon. Second and Washington streets.
The fourth member of the gang, "Red"
Liynch, is at large.

SLOPPY SPORTS
WITNESSED BY
A SMALL CROWD
Three Long Shots Finished
in Front Down at
Tanforan.
Morelia Finally Left the Maiden
Classâ Another Fair of Brackets
for Rollickâ Ferseus in
Form.
The mud at Tanforan Park yesterday
was a golden brown in color, and of a
holding, gluey nature, an analysis of
which is anxiously awaited by the
"students." It caused three) favorites to
bo retired and several other short-priced
horses to be attacked with locomotor
ataxia or some other Â» speed destroying
disease. Morelia, Captive and Amasa
splashed In at juicy quotations, to the ap
parent enjoyment of a handful of last
chance takers.
A big band of maiden fillies and mares
started in the opening scramble, with Red
Cherry closing a luKewarm choice over
Swiftwater and Artilla. The winner turn
ed up In- Morelia, a 6 to 1 chance, owned
by 'â¢Jim" Neil, which won easily from
Artilla and Bona.
Receding In the betting -from even
money to 7 to 5, Rollick ran circles around
her company in the two- year-old daah.
After showing the way for some distance.
Chaste lost the place to Floranthe, a 20 to
1 outsider.
Everybody and everybody's friend
spread their checks about on Perseus to
win the mile selling run. The gelding did
it in such a way as to leave no doubt
about the result, finishing nearly a six
teenth of a mile ahead of Storm King.
Dolore â¢ secured the "look-In." Not a
bark was heard from Dogtown.
It was said Catastrophe early evinced a
dislike for moisture, so Carroll's horse
backed up in the betting on the mile and
a sixteenth run. Played from 10 to 7,
Ross, on Captive, led the parade from
barrier time, stealing home on the "chin
strap." Opponent beat Catastrophe out
for place honors.
Amasa, at odds of 10 and 12, made a
ragtime farce of the five and a half fur
long Jaunt, winning all the way." Espir
ando, a long shot as usual, led Moringa
over the mark a head for the second cut.
Miss Marion, the favorite, grew peevish
and refused to play after rounding the
bend for home.
Corrlgan's filly Sardine met a bunch of
degenerates In the closing run, never be
ing compelled to get out of a gallop.
Cromwell, after a struggle, took the place
from Fille d' Or.

Original Affidavit
Is Said to Be a
Fraud at the
Start.
Not a Too Positive Story
From the Prime Wit
ness in the Fair Case.
Cross-Examination Is
Now Under Way.
NOT an outburst of lawyer's elo
quence or a single wrathful display
of Invective was heard in the Fair
triÃl yesterday afternoon. All was
rober. heavy labor on the part of
the attorneys, for Judge G. W. Simpton
of Sausalito was on the witness stand,
the man v.ho at one time declared that
he had married Mrs. Nettie R. Craven to
Senator Fair in the year 1832.
Simpton was the third witness who was
scheduled to appear for the petitioner,
but at the critical moment went over to
the other side with a tale of falsehood,
chicanery and perjury on his lips. He
stands to-day the central figure In the
case and it is upon his shoulders that the
burden of proof will rest- Judge Simpton
was not absolutely positive about some
things to which he testified. At times he
Bought refuge in the general panacea for
uncomfortable witnessesâ the stereotyped
"I don't remember." Like the others who
changed cars in a hurry he admitted that
he dived Into the ocean of falsehood and
tlg-ned a paper under oath that was wov
en out of a skein of falsehood. Simpton
lacked Sylva's positiveness of speech and
manner, yet he showed the same disre
gard for twinges of conscience and vener
ation of Justice. So far there has come
to lig-ht no Joe Harvey In the Sausalito
Recorder's testimony. He has not yet
given utterance to a motive for his
switching, but It may come to-day or to
morrow, for he will surely be kept upon
the stand the rest of the week.
Simpton Tells His Story.
Attorney Knight raised his voice to its
highest pitch and called for Judge Simp
ton, but the Judge came not. It took
some five minutes before the bailiff could
locate the witness, and then the trial be
gan.
George Knight conducted the direct ex
amination, which was Ehort. pithy and
Fpeedy of execution. After the few pre
liminary interrogations the attorney
switched to the matter In hand. His first
material question was about Sirnpton's
nceopancy of the office of Justice of the
Peace and the response was:
"I was Justice of the Peace In Sausa
lito from lbi-S to ISSS."
"Did you ever know Senator Fair in
his lifetime?" interrogated Knight.
"No, tir; I did not."
"Do you know Nettie R. Craven?"
"Yes. Fir; since last July."
Charles Pence then moved to have the
last two answers pponged off the book,
but his argumentative efforts proved fu
tile, and they were allowed to cling to the
record by judicial decision.
"Did you, in Sausalito in July, IS!>2. or
in any other place, perform a marriage
ceremony or n solemnization of a mar
riape ceremony between Mrs. Craven and
Senator Fair?" was the next question.
"No. sir." was the ready answer.
"Have you ever had a conversation with
airs. Craven in regard to an alleged mar
riage between herself and Senator Fair?"
Â¦ "Yea, sir."
"Where was It and when?"
"Jn Sausallto. the sth day of August,
IS&S. Sylva and I met Mrs. Craven and Du
r.and on the sidewalk." Mrs. Craven shook
me by the hand as if she knew me for
years. She and I walked away from the
others. We sat on the steps of my office
and che asked me if I had seÂ«n Sylva.
6he asked me to say nothing about* this
matter not being the truth. Then we
went to Sylva's house and in the pres
ence of Sylva, Dunand and Mrs. Craven.
Sylva said: 'Rt member, the Judge is to
pel JIO.'XjO for this?'
"I was to testify how I had met Senator
Fair. I had been a conductor and was to
fay I met him on the cars. She wanted
me to oome into court and say I mar
ried her to Senator Fair In 1532."
"When next did you see her?"
"In Pence's office In presence of Lafe
and Charles Pence, who were there a part
cf the thne."
That Marriage Ceremony.
George Knight and all the other Fair
attorneys were heartily satisfied with this
testimony. With a wave of the hand
Knight fairly yelled: "That's all; take the
Â¦witness;" and Lafe Pence's cross-examin
ation began.
"Are you acquainted with W. W.
Foote?" was Pence's first question.
"I met him twice," came from the wit
ness.
"Wore you acquainted with Senator
Fair?"
"No, sir."
"With Mrs. Craven before August 5?"
"No. sir."
"Do you remember when the marriage
of Mrs. Craven to Senator Fair was made
public?" Â¦
"No. I do not."
"I>o you remember having a conversa
tion '*-ith Mrs. Roy in regard to the ma.r
rlatf In 1836. when Mrs. Roy asked you

"No, sir, I did not," was the emphatic
answer. .
"Did you not in the spring or summer of
1896. at 102 O'Farrell street, have a con
versation in which Mr. Faulkner asked
you if they were married and you said,
'I know it?* "
"I may have had that conversation, but
never said that."
"Did you call upon Mr. Faulkner during
the Grand Jury session at his office and
say that you wanted him not to testify
that you had any conversation with Mrs.
Roy and not to say anything about wh.it
you told him in regard to the marriage?"
"I told him the lirst part, but not the
second."
The Original Affidavit.
Simpton was then shown a letter writ
ten by himself to W. "\Y. Foote and the
original affidavit which he made in Foote's
office on August 12.
"When was this letter written?" was
the question from Lafe Pence.
"On August 8, at Sylva's house," said
Simpton.
In this letter Sylva wrote to Foote about
the facts of the alleged marriage and his
long acquaintance with Fair and Mrs.
Craven. - ; ;â¢â¢.Â¦:.
Simpton admitted that the contents of
the letter were false, except a few minor
unimportant details.
"How soon after that was it when you
saw Mr. Foote?" inquired Pence.
"On the 11th," answered Simpton.
"You went with Dunand from his of
fice?"
"Yes, sir."
"You received an answer from Mr.
Foote?"
"Yes, sir; I'll bring It with me to-mor
row."
Pence produced a carbon copy of it. In
the letter Foote asked for an interview
vith Simnlon. The next day Simptor. and
Dunand called upon W. \V. Foote at his
office, where the latter put the Sausalito
Recorder through a series of questions,
fiimpton denied that Foote interrogated
him about the time he came to know
Fair, the date of the marriage, the lady
petitioner and other matters relating to
the case.
"Did he ask or suggest the making oi an
affidavit at all?" interrogated Pence. ->â¢ .
"No. sir."
"Did he not dictate the affidavit In your
presence?"
"No. sir."
"After the affidavit was written out, did
you not read it over?"
"Yes, eir."
The affidavit, in referring to the mar
riage, shows a change from "in the year
1802" to "in or about the year 1592," but
Simpton testified that this alteration was
made not in his presence, but that it ap
peared on the paperwhen It was handed to
him. He declared that he refused to sign
the affidavit that day, but would return
on the morrow and sign.it. According to
Simpton the affidavit was brought out to
him from the other room.
I*afe Pence and Siznpton met after the
interview in Foote's office. Dunand was
with Simpton and the three walked down
the street together. Pence then asked
.Simpton if he had not told him about his
friendship with Senator Fair and Mrs.
Craven. Simpton would not commit him
self, but. with the reservation that he
knew it to be a bald, unmitigated lie. he
confessed having- " spoken of this fact' to
somebody, very probably to Mrs. Craven,
who claimed to have met him in the days
gone by, when he was a car driver, at va
rious 'times on thÂ« different roads of the
city. Soon after Simpton was taken with
a gleam of memory, and he admitted that
he made a statement during the walk
down' tho street about his early acquaint
anceship with Fair and Mrs. Craven.
Simpton was very obliging at this point,
saying: "Oh. I'll swear to it to please
you."
."What happened when you came up. the
next day?" continued Pence In cross-ex
amination.
"I read the affidavit. The notary public
was there and I then signed it, leaving
immediately after that."

TRIES TO KILL
COMPANION OF
A TRUANT WIFE
. . Â¦ 'â¢ Â» . ;
A Tragedy Averted by ' the
Coolness ; of a State
Policeman.
Mrs. de la Monte Buns Away From
Benicia and Is Overtaken in
. This City by Her Irate
\-/- Husband. Â¦Â¦Â¦:
There was a scene of Intense excitement
on Clay street wharf yesterday in which
a runaway wife, her alleged lover, her
husband and W7 Ingram of the State Har
bor Police were mixed up. ' Had It not
been for the Intervention of the policeman
the reputed lover would have lost the
number of his mess, and as it is he will
bear the marks of the encounter for sev
eral days to come. The fight was a fierce
and bloody one while If lasted and the
woman almost fainted when her husband
knocked her lover down and then at
tempted to kill him.
A few days ago Jean de la Monte was
the happiest man in Benlcia. He was
fairly well to do, had a young wife whom
he adored and \ a friend who was unto
him like a brother. The friend, Victor
r^unez, had fallen upon evil days and
about six months ago he was stranded In
Napa without the wherewith to buy a
glass of wine. He wrote to his friend, De
la Monte, and the latter brought him to
Benicia, fed- and clothed him and finally
got him a Job.
According to De la Monte, Victor lodged
with him, and as the months passed be
gan to take an especial^ interest in
Mrs. de la Monte. De la Monte was the
last to notice what was going on, and had
he found his wife alone on Clay street
wharf yesterday he would have gone
down on his knees to her and asked her to
return home. Instead he found her with
Nunez.
After separating- the men. Officer Ing
ram tried*to appease the husband's wrath,
but failed completely. He would not even
give the woman carfare nor would he per
mit her to get anything In his name. To
Ingram he told the following story and
every time he had to mention his wife's
name he would shake his finger In her
direction, while the mention of his rival
caused hia hand to wander to a sheath
knife he carried in his belt:
"Nunez and my wife ran away on the
steamer Dauntless," said he. "She went
to the grocer and borrowed $7, saying I
wanted it. Then she packed her trunk
and shipped it under the name of Elvira
Mazzola.- That was her name before I
married her. When the grocer told me
of her having borrowed the money I hur
ried home and only then I discovered that
she had fled. I Immediately took the
train for San Francisco and caught them
both on the wharf. I will surely kill Nu
nez if I catch him, and my wife I never
want to see again. Victor I treated like a
brother and everything I had was his al
ways excepting my wife. Her he stole
from me and now I want revenge."
Ofticer Ingram took Mrs. de la Monte
to. the Lombard Hotel on Pacific street
and left her with some friends. When
he came out of 'the building he met the
husband on the street. Monte said he
was going to keep watch, as he thought
Nunez might return, and he wanted
to catch him. Ingram warned him to do
no violence, and said the best thing he
could do would be to go back to Benlcia
and forget all- about his wife and his
faithless friend.
Mrs. de la Monte has a different story
to tell apropos of her sudden departure
from Benicia,' and it is a tale altogether
unlike that told by her irate spouse.
"I did not run away from home with
Victor Nunez,' she said. "My husband
! treated me shamefully, and as I could no
longer endure his cruelty I determined to
leave him. I decided to come to this city
and get- some work to do. On the boat I
met Nunez. He had no Idea that I was
coming to town, and I was astonished to
see him. Our meeting was purely acci
dental. I believe that my husband Is now
convinced that I did not run off with
Nunez, and that he has gone quietly back
to Benicia and the tannery, where he is
employed."
Last evening Nunez was about the Lom
bard! Hotel in a glorious frame of mind
and with quarts of home-made wine surg
ing madly In his brain. He was, however,
only allowed the' privileges of the bar. the
Lombardl bonlface denying him the pleas
ure of occupying a room under the same
roof with Mrs. do la Monte.

THREE PHILIPPINE
COMMISSIONERS HERE
THREE of the four Philippine Com
missioners frcm e*st of the Rockies
arrived in the city yesterday and
are quartered with their families at
the Palace. They are Judge Wil
liam' H. Taft of Cincinnati, chairman of
the commission;. Professor Dean c.. Wor
cester of Michigan, and Judge Luke *..
Wright of Memphis. The fourth Eastern
member, Henry C. Ide of Vermont, is ex
pected to arrive this morning. They will
afl meet to-day at the University Club,
where a luncheon is to be given In theh
honor by Professor Bernard Moses, aftei
which they will hold a formal meeting to
elect a secretary. Charles N. Pepper, thu
noted correspondent, was appointed secre
tary some time ago. but declined the
honor. His successor will be named to-
The Commissioners expect to sail for
Manila on the transport Hancock about
the 16th Inst. They are all accompanied
by . their families. The clerical force to
accompany the commission consists of a
secretary, - assistant secretary. Spanish
secretary, translator and a private secre
tary for each member. There will be
forty-three people In the party. The ladles
and children are to be left at Yokohama
for a month, until the Commissioners
have secured houses and made everything
ready for their comfort.
Of the five Commissioners Professor
Worcester Is the only one who has ever
been in the Philippines. He was a mem
ber of the last commission, and spent some
time there with the army. Prior to that
time he made two scientific expeditions
Into the islandsâ the first In 1887 and the
last in 1891, on which occasion he remained
three years. He has held the chair of as
sistant professor of zoology at Ann Arbor
University, but recently resigned the po
sition. He has published a book on the
Islands, which has proved very valuable.
Cnairman Taft is probably the beat
known man on the commission. During
the past eight years he has been United
States Circuit Judge of the Sixth District,
with his home at Cincinnati, but resigned
his position in order. to give all his time
to this important work. Prior to his ap
pointment to the bench of the United
States Circuit Court Judge Taft was So
licitor General of the United States for two
years, and, before receiving that appoint
ment was for many years a Judge In the
Superior Courts of Ohio. Judge Taft is
accompanied by his wife and three chil
dren, the oldest, a boy of 10, and his sis
ter-in-law, Miss Hei ron.
"I do not care to discuss the Philippine
question'- In a newspaper Interview." said
Judge Taft yesterday, "for what I. have t<*
say must be said with great care. I have
made but one speech , on the subject, at
Cincinnati on March 6, and at that time I
expressed my sentiments. I am to make
one to-morrow night at the banquet. I be
lieve, so that will be suffldert. I do not
care to talk on politics at all, for I have
enough on my hands now."
Following Is an excerpt from the speech
made by Judge Taft at Cincinnati on
March 5. in which he states his position
at the present time:
I am not now and never, have. . been an
expansionist. I have â¢ always hoped that
the Jurisdiction of our nation would not
extend' beyond the territory between the
two oceans. We have not solved all the
problems of popular government so perfectly
as to justify our voluntarily seeking- more
difficult ones abroad. We have not volun
tarlly sought them. Circumstances beyond
our control, the sequel of the Spanish war.
have thrust, on us responsibility for the
future government of the Philippines. The
proposition Is vigorously denied by high
minded and conscientious men and by some
with a fury of superlative and epithet that
Is hardly consistent with a judicial attitude
or an impartial consideration of the ques
tion. '
My conviction is that the calm Investiga
tion of the. future historian into all the
conditions existing at the time of taking
each step toward the present situation in
the Philippines will lead him to conclude
that President McKlnley and . his adminis
tration selected in each crisis the only al
ternative which a due regard to our nation
al and international obligations would per
mit.
Judge Wright is one of the ablest law
yers Â¦ In the South, and is well fitted for
the Important work for which he hds been
selected. He "did not care last night to
discuss the Philippine question.
To-night the Commissioners will be ban
queted at the Palace Hotel by friends of
Professor Moses. Over 300 Invitations
have been Issued.
