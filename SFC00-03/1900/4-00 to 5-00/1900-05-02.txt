the booths these thousands of young peo
ple rushed to and fro until the night came
on. At the lemonade and ice cream
booths thÂ«Â»y swarmed around the counters.
On the slopes and in the glen they were
like bees In a hive. Of course they were
full of the noise that goes with youth, and
as It wan essentially a day for children,
the teachers sheathed their rattans and
closed their check books.
So well ordered and arranged was the
celebration that no accidents of a serious
r.ature occurred. The cars during the
Â«"arly hours of the morning were Jammed
with the merry-making and jubilant
Bchool children under the charge of moth
ers and friends. Once on the grounds the
fun began. The more adventurous young
ones took to the high slopes, climbing the
hills that overhang the gien. or chasing
one another over every inch of ground
within the fences. Three separate per
formances in the theater drew packed
houses. The participants were all chil
dren of ages varying from 5 to 12. and
they gave a show of cakewalks. fancy
dancing and singing that won the audi
ence body and soul. ; Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦-.--Â¦
The feature of the Indoors celebration
was the Maypole -winding and the crown-
Ing of the queen. Jesse Eva Swift played
the part Of youthful majesty and she
played It well. To Raymon Landsberger
fell the duty of Investing the "Queen o'
th* May" with royal headpiece and the
Insignia of regal- power. Phyllis

: But the real Hie of the festival was on
tiv* outside. The eun did not shine nor did
the rain fall, although the overhanging
rlouds were full of menacing vapors.
Every variety of pastime and child's sport
wbb indulged In. Races of all descrip
tions, calisthenics and drills absorbed the
attention of hundreas of children In their
phy**:aJ culture work.' So varied was the
programme 'that' 'it Is hard to say Just
what; was not on the bill. Boys' bands
supplied the music, which. If It were: not
<it the quality that : rouses the musician to

It was Intended -.and that was enough.
The <lay did not pass without the pres^

Benefit for Teachers' Annuity
Fund a Most Phenomenal
Success.
Not elncf the Woodward's Garden's
Mavday Jcstivais has th^re been such a
'â¢Hpbratlon as that which packed Glen
Park yesterday with more than 30,000 chil
dren and adults. From morning till noon
and from noon till night the school chil
dren of San Francisco made a holiday of
their brief release from studies, romping
on the green hills, swinging on the "flying
Dutchman." climbing a greased pole, run
ning rates, shouting In youthful Joy and
going into all the multiform pleasures of
the park with real juvenile abajidon.
There has been nothing like It in San
Francisco for many years, and the school
teachers may well be proud of their suc
cessful efforts. The teachers' annuity
fund, for which this festival was given as
a benefit, will be swelled by many thou
sands of dollars. Tickets aggregating
$21(KÂ» were reported as sold up to 6 o'clock
Monday evening and the gate receipts
were over S700. When full reports are re

opinion that the net returns will reach at
THIRTY THOUSAND
CHILDREN SWARM
INTO GLEN PARK
THE first of May, which in the
calendars of this country has a
double significance, was most
fittingly observed yesterday by school
children and patriots alike. Many
stores were closed and business took
a brief respite, while thousands o!
people left the city for out-of-door
amusements of various kinds. . . â¢
Across the bay on the Marin and
Alameda sides picnickers made the
most of their few hours' suxceas* from
the cares of daily labor. All day the
cars traveling to the outlying dis
tricts were packed with pleasure-seek
ers. At Glen Park a mammoth fes
tival, at which there were between
thirty and forty thousand attendants,
proved the event of the day. It will
long be remembered by the school
children of this city as a day of gen
eral pleasure in which there was
neither hitch nor halt. ;.
The celebrations in the open did
not close the observance of the holi
day. During the evening patriotic
societies held meetings reciting the
deeds of the great naval hero and
toasting to the battle which enrolled
Dewey's name in the books of the
immortals.

longs to see them.
Providence sends to his bedside one who

CONVALESCENT'S JOY.
But there is no spring In McConnell, ser
geant of another Highland regiment â
nothing but sour disgust. He got It In the
hand, around Paardeberg, a. rending, shat
tering bullet, that has marked him for
England. And there Is what Is left of his
company to* consider, and there Is his un
paid debt to the Boer, drawing Interest
every day, and there Is his right hand
throbbing and aching in the night
watches. His chief interest is the dally
paper and the list of the Boer dead. He
lies In his corner, smoking, brooding and
â¢meditating how to escape England. But
his hand â his right hand, with the iron
hard forearmâ is useless. He always
comes back to that. f
N'ot far from him lies Carter, who went
down hill by reason of a fractured thigh
and some fever.
Then he got bed soresâ two, he told me â
and then they got him an air mattress.
Carter came near to losing his life, but the
story In the ward Is that Neeld. a grace
less Cockney Highlander, bucked him up,
precisely as Dinniss bucked up the man
shot through the lung-s.
Anyhow, Carter is spared, which is a
sign of grace, and they have taken him
out for a small walk in a wheeled chair.
"He kep* askln' us all the way up hill If
he -was too heavy." said one of Carter's
steedsâ a convalescent with a head wound.
"Well, you see, it's voluntary, not com
pulsory, takin* convalescents "out." says
Carter, rather tremulous about the mouth.
. "You don't weigh more'n a rat now,"
is the answer, and then, the voice touched
with beautiful tenderness, "Did ye like
it r 'Arry?"
He went off to draw his kit, walking
corkily, and the guardsman whispered
husky congratulations.
But Johnson was a changed man. He
had developed a scheme, and explained It
as he sat grasping his ankles and rocking
to and fro. They were going to send him
to Green Point with other convalescents.
The odds wore they would send him home,
and that did not suit Johnson's revised
book. "I'm a saddler by trade. They'll not
miss the likes of me when they're repair-
Ing collars and harness. I'll not be sent
home till the war Is overâ if I can help It.
Surely they'll need a collarmaker. Then
I'll be able to get back again."
Johnson of a Highland' regimentâ he
looked very like Alan Breck â had tried to
stop a shell splinter with his stomach,
and it cost him eight weeks' agony. The
first time we met he walked crab fash
ion, his blue ; eyes alight with a pain.
Hear, O heaven, and bear witness, O
earth, that there was no more South Af
rica for Johnson and his stomach! A
fortnight later we sat in the sun with a
whispering guardsman, half of whoso
larynx had been put out of commission
by a down dropping bullet.
So, under the pines planted In South
Africa, toy men from the north, Welsh
man, tyke, cockney and Canadian bent
their heads over a Melbourne weekly,
while a Queenslander read the letter
press.

fame grew, as it were;-, with each stroke

in 1SS9 was awarded a grand. prize. In 18JÂ»0

Munkacsy was famous ': for his daring
originality, fine colbring and â¢ surprising
effects of light and air, but it has been
objected that his canvases were too crowd
ed with figures. ' .
In 1S96 he left Paris, where he had re
sided for fourteen years, and returned to
his native country. From overstrain of
work or some other cause riot yet well
known, he developed -symptoms of insari

Mr. Lascelles accepts everything calm
ly, lie is young and has the divine faith.
"In twenty years' time!" he says, and
his eye, with a budding sty on' It,
glows. "Ah, but it's all a gamble."
I, make haste to qualify. "One
has to take one's chances." "I'll take
'em,"- says Mr. Lascelles, and, when you
come to think of it, a man who has been
risking his life for a Â¦ few weeks is not
going to be deterred by the prospect of
one fruit. farm, or half a' dozen for that
matter, falling on his ..hands/
I will arrange low freights If I have-to
go on my knees to a German shipping
firm. I will break the Covent Garden fruit
ring into flinders. M' will erect cold stor
age warehouses by the acre, and chilled
fruit cars at 40 "degrees uniform shall be
as common as cattle trucks- on all our
lines. 1 Â¦ will develop under the care of a
half dozen picked canal officers from In
dia such a scheme of irrigation (it will
not cost more than $3,000,000 to begin with)
as shall beat the Bara Doab. Colorado
and the Queensland colonies combined.
In twenty minutes;. I have pledged the
honor of the empire to.'the hilt on behalf
of Lascelles and company. If thej'- mean
business everything shall : be made easy
for their first start . '. I will lend them
money on mortgage (at least you will,, and
we shall get 4 per cent). I will, slap down
railway? along the valleys where the fruit
grows, ,ao that no farm '. need haul her
dried prunes more' than five miles to the
rail. (This is not so mad as it sounds, for
such valley3 are few.) â¢
If so,, bring them along, Â¦ and we .will

than settle here and grow up In a new
country, eh? It is represented to Las

badly. Yes, Mr. Lascelles, this Is the one
land for the new man of colonial expe
rienceâfor open air men used to large
spaces and plain living, thousands of

full' sized jiackapes. and any druggist from
Maine to California, if his opinion were
asV:<?<J. -wHl Fay that Stuart's Dyspepsia-
Tablets is the most poF ll la r and successful
remedy for any stomach trouble. . :
In a Restaurant. . :
A pbysiclan puts the query: Have you
never noticed in ar.y lr.rge restaurant at
lunch cr dinner time the large number of
hearty, vigorous oid men at the tables;
rr.cn whx>se aces run from CO to S3 years,
many of them bald and all perhaps eray,
but none of them fcol>!Â° or Â«e:iile?
Perhaps th? sppctae'e !s so ec.rr.mon as
to have escaped your obsr-rvatlon or com-
ment, but rÂ«>vÂ»>ttheloss it is an object les-
sen which means scme.thlng.
If you wilt notiro what these hearty old
felloirs are ratir.R: you will observe that
they -are fcot inuneh'.ng bran crackers nor
gingerly pic^.ng f their way . through a
nraii cartS of new f.ineled health foods;
:oji the contrary, they . srem to prefer a
Juicy rcast crt -tw>ef, ; a properly. turned loin
of raatloa and even t^'-e df-adly broiled lob-
ster la not altogother Ignored. .:. .
â¢ rThe point of all this i? that a, vigorous
c>4 age dep<*n*is upon srood Jijropfion and
,pl6nty of whoiesome food, and n6f upon
dieting and an endeavor to livq upon bran
crackers. 'â¢ 'Â¦ Â¦ '. ' Â¦.-'Â¦Â¦:..:.:"Â¦â¢ .''Â¦;:['Â¦
/vThcre is a certain class -of food cranks'
who seenj to believe that meat, coffee and
n?any ether gooti things are rank poisons,
;fcut these cadaverous, sickly looUing indi-
viduals are a walkir.g: condemnation of
Iheir own theories. : â¢'...â¢.;Â¦Â¦::. '
The taattcr in a nutrfiell is that If the
etoniach secrete* the natural digestive'
Jujces In suSicient Quantity any whqle-
Eonie food will be promptly digested; If
the fitoraach does r.ot do so, and certain
foods cause distress one or two of Stuart's
pyspe;'s!a Tablets after each meal will re-
n:ove all difficulty, because., they -'supply'
just what every weak Btonmcb lacks, pep-
: sin. hydrochloric acid, diastase and ttux. '-.-Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets do not act
upon the bowels, and in fact are not
etrictly a medicine, as they act almost en-
tirely upon the food eaten, digesting it
thorcushly. and thus give a much needed
rest/asd giving an appetite for the next
meal:'.- Â¦'.-' ... . Â¦. Â¦-.Â¦:. .. .' ; ' !.,..
J Of people who travel nine out Â©i ten use
Â£tuart*s Dyspepsia Tablets, knowing them
to be perfectly Eafe to use at any time;
and also baring found out by 'experience
that they are a safeguard against indi-
gestion in any form, and eating-, as they
have to, at all hours and all kinds of
food, the traveling; public for years have
pinned their faith to Stuart's Tahlets.

The origin of kissing Is beyond the ken of

ADVICE TO TRAVELERS.
\ :-
APPRAISER WAKEMAN of the New York
Custom-house has recently suggested to the
Treasury Department the advisability of issuing
for the benefit of persons going to the Paris Exposi
tion a circular giving information concerning the
tariff regulations as to the importation of wearing ap
parel and other personal effects, to the end that on
their return the tourists will know to what extent they
will have to pay duties. The department 'officials
have the subject under consideration, but as it may
be some time before the circular is issued it will be
well for travelers to post themselves on the matter
without waiting for it..;-// : ,
The clause in the tariff to which the Appraiser de
sires attention directed provides: "That in case of
residents of the United States returning from abroad
all wearing apparel and other personal. effects taken
by them out of the United States to foreign coun
tries shall be admitted free of duty, without regard ro
their value, upon their identity being established, un
der appropriate rules and regulations to be prescribed
by the Secretary of the Treasury, but no more than
$100 in,' value of articles purchased abroad by. such
residents pf the United States shall be admitted free
of duty: upon their return." Â¦ â¢.
In his recommendation to the. Treasury Department
Mr. Wakeman suggested that "a circular describing
fully the provisions of the. personal ; baggage law be
issued for the information of all passengers going
abroad; that .this circular of information and instruc
tions.be accompanied by. a blank declaration such as
the passenger is compelled '.to sign 4 upon his arrival
here; that this circular of information and instruc
tion and declaration be placed in sealed envelope's
and that the masters of the various steamships.en
gaged in trans-Atlantic trade be requested to place a
copy of this circular, instructions and declaration in
the hands of each passenger soon after sailing .from
abroad." 'Â¦'.'Â¦.' â¢â¢ .
It will be perceived that if carried out the plan will
give the passenger an opportunity of careful prepara
tion of his declarations before arriving in port and
would moreover fully explain to him the provisions of
the law and thus enable "him to avoid the trouble
which would resuK from mistakes. There will be, of
course, an immense amount of .baggage to be handled
when the .rush of the returning tourists comes upon
the Custom-house and unless the passengers have a
fair understanding, of the law; there is, sure to be fric
tion and discontent. ; It is to be hoped the Treasury
Department' will carry out the plan; for, as Mr. .Wake
man says, "the officials of the Government should do

IN SHIP BUILDING.
IIJUGENE T. CHAMBERLAIN, Commissioner
of Navigation, has recently pointed out that
â * one of the advantages we will derive from a
liberal policy toward our ship-builders' and ship
owners is that of increasing the economy of ship con
struction exactly in proportion as. we increase the
extent of it. In other words, the scale on which an
industry is conducted ha$ much to do with the degree
of its efficiency in competing with rivals.
As an illustration of that fact Mr. Chamberlain
says: ''The railroad mileage of the United States is
considerably greater than that of all' Europe, and in
all that relates to railroad construction, the building
of locomotives, the manufacture of structural steel for
railroad bridges, and the making of steel rails, Ameri
can capital and la-bor are employed on a larger scale,
and consequently are much more efficient than any
where else in the world. For 1898 our greatest single
export of steel manufactures was $4,613,376 of steel
rails, and our^next greatest (except miscellaneous
builders' hardware) was $3,883,719 worth of loco
motives. We can export locomotives, rails and
bridges in competition with Great Britain, because
our railroad system is eight times greater than Great
Britain's. Great. Britain can 'export' (i. e., sell to
foreigners) steel steamships because' she manufac
tures on a scale from fifteen to twenty times greater
than the United States. During the calendar year
1899 Great Britain not only built practically all her
own shipping, but also sold. to foreign nations, or 'ex
ported,' $45,000,000 of shipping." . v Â¦Â¦Â¦
From that fact it is easy to draw the conclusion
that even if the upbuilding of an extensive merchant
marine in our own shipyards should be more costly
for a time than it would be to buy ships from Great
Britain, it would not be long under a liberal policy
before we would develop a ship-building industry on
a scale sufficiently large to enable us to beat Great
Britain in ship construction even 'as we beat her now
in railroad construction. We should, then draw to
our own yards much of that enormous foreign pa
tronage which employs so many British workmen in
the shipyards and adds so much to the wealth of the
kingdom. '. Â¦ â¢; . .
"From 1889" to 1898,. inclusive. Great -Britain- built
9,682,829 jgross tons "of sf a-going steam vessels, or
over 80 per. cent of the world's total product of
11,045,937 gross .tons for the decade. A very large
proportion of the Britishrbuilt .tonnage; moreover,
was constructed for foreign nations. The demand for
steamers increases of course with the expansion of
commerce, : ahd therefore the annual output of new
.vessels will! increase .steadily. It will.be seen, then,
that supremacy' in the ship-building ' trade is a pm-j
worth " contending ' for. . It 1 will require wise legisla
tion,-however, to enable'us to" attain it, for the com -
petition will be. strong. As the; Commissioner of
Navigation, says:- "Two British ' shipyards, one with
an xmtput-.of 77,501 gross tons and another with an
output .of. .82,634 gross tons, each- built more steel
steam vessels during the year just closed than the en-;
tire output of steel steam Vessels forthe year on the
whole scabbard, of the United ; Statesâ 54,643 > gross
tonsâ yet our construction of-this description was the
largest in -our, history: When it is further considered
that our' own" product 'was almost, wholly, under the
protection of the coasting laws, while the' British
product is almost wholly for foreign trade, the long
lead we have to overcomeis even, Vnore patent." .;

BRYAN fqND THE G LD A\EN.
COLONEL BRYAN went up to Port Huron,
Michigan, to point out a way for return cf
Gold Democrats to the party. After declaring
that the Kansas City convention will stick to the
Chicago platform, free silver, divinely appointed
ratio and all, he kindly remarked: ."The Gold Demo
crats who come back can defend their coming on
two grounds. They can say that they are convinced
that the position taken by the party in 1S96 was right
and that they were wrong, or they can say that be
cause of new questions that have arisen, and which
will all be included in the platform, they are now will
ing to accept the platform as a whole." ,
How very nice of him! It is so kind for him to
tell Gold Democrats what to say, to give them the
password, as it were, by which they can pass the Pop
ulist sentinels at the party gate!
Then, his politico-medical idea of making the Chi
cago platform palatable by diluting it with new is
sues is worthy of study. He proposes to put the poi
son of 1806 in a tub full of fresh water and ask the
gold men to come and drink it "as a whole."
It is not appirent that any considerable number
will rush for a sr.p of his diluted swash. The trouble
with Colonel Bryan is that he has been proved to
have been wrong on every issue he raised in 1896.
Every statement he made in that campaign is proven
false, every prophecy has failed. This makes the
country suspicious of his judgment about new issues.
He desires to sugar-coat the old pill with new issues,
but there is a suspicion that the coating is glucose.
His anxiety to bring the v.-andering gold sinners
back to his silver home is undoubted. It is manifest
in frequent rumors that the said sinners are leap
frogging each other to get at the mourner's bench.
Not long ago Mr. Cleveland was represented as on
the way, clad in sackcloth, .and with ashes on his
head, and Carl Schurz was reported as a returning
exile.
But not long after these rumors thrilled the silver
camp Mr. Cleveland in his Brooklyn dinner letter
gave Mr. Bryan a backhander that made his political
jaws ache, and now Carl Schurz is quoted to the ef
fect that he regards Colonel Bryan as a curiosity, a
most active, interesting, sincere curiosity. The same
could be said of the living skeleton and the fat ladv
in the sideshow. . :
Colonel. Bryan's conspicuous accessions are not
from the Geld Democracy. He has acquired Gov
ernor Pingrec of Michigan, a Populistic- Republican,
upon whom fads arc as thick, as ticks on a heifer
srr.itten with Texas fever. His career as Governor ot
Michigan hss been distinguished by appointment of
reformers to ofiicc. ir.any of whom arc now fugitives
from justice, and some of whom are in the peniten
tiary. His joining the Bryan -camp is^significant of a
quality therein that is most repugnant to Gold Demo
crats: It is the sand in which all. sorts of isms,
ologies. onomics and skim-milk theories breed.'
Bryan is attractive to every kind of ; fanaticism. The
Gold Democrats arc a rather steady and cool-headed
sort, and take their politics straight'and solid. They
don't like to touch elbows with Populists, who think
the law of gravitation can be repealed by an act of
They would rather have no hoiida/'than picnic
with Altgreid and Pingrec* Therefore it is apparent
that no Gold Democrat need Â«jo to Bryan early to
avoid the ru?h. There will he -none.
FASHION HINT FROM PARIS.
The Government engineers have not yet
finished their soundings over the spot
where Shag Rock reared Its ugly head.
In order to carry out the . contract there
must be 30 feet of water, on the spot at
low water, and the chances seem to be
that some more work ;wlU have to be
done before- the engineers are satisfied. .
Not a few uninformed people have the
idea- that the money spent- for the de
struction of these rocks is being thrown
away. The matter has: been thoroughly
Investigated by the Chamber of Com
merce, which was one of the bodies that
urgently recommended- that the bay be
cleared of these obstructions. A resolu
tion was sent to Congress two years aeo
asking that this work be done, and in
support of the request was a list of ves
sels known to have been totally lost or
badly damaged on Shag and Arch rocks
The list shows the following wrecks:

Another Cape Nome passenger vessel
got away yesterday. The rush may now
be said to be on and from this time forth
until August not a week will pass with
out a vessel leaving port headed for the
gold fields of Alaska.
The Portland, with over 250 passengers,
sailed Monday and the Albion of the
Klmball line got away yesterday with
nearly 150 gold hunters aboard. Every
passenger was provided with the best of
accommodation and the butchers were
still cutting up fresh meat and putting
It in the cold storage when the steamer
pulled away from the wharf, so no one
will go short of good substantial food
during the voyage. - . Â¦

not entitled to be there.
A "Man Overboard" Scare.
The captain and crew of the ferry boat
Berkeley declare they were made the
victims of a miserable hoax on the 11 a.
m. trip yesterday. While the vessel wa3
in mid stream the cry "A man over
board!" went up. The deckhand who
heard the alarm at once signaled the
pilot house. The Berkeley was stopped
and a boat lowered. A search of the wa
ters within a hundred yards of the ferry
boat was made, but not a trace of a
would-be suicide could be found. The
captain left the chief officer in charge of
the pilot house and made a personal can
vass of the passengers, but not a soul
who saw a man Jump overboard could bo
found. Instead there was some slight
evidence that the whole thing had em
anated from a band of practical Jokers,
so the matter ended there. If It was a
false alarm it was a very poor kind of a
joke: if it was not, one more unfortunate
has met his fate in the waters of the
bay. ,

went aboard. It seemed like old times to

while. Captain Edward L. King of the

Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: In my opin
ion the farmer9 of California are not with
you in seeking 1 measures for the exclusion
of Japanese laborers. Without them it
will be almost impossible to harvest the
fruit and grape crops. Farm labor is
scarce now and entirely too high priced
in comparison with the present cheapness
of hay. grain, fruit and grapes. Nor Is It
true that the Japanese work for cheap
wages. I have paid them as high as Jl ~o
per day during last season's vintage, when
white labor was not obtainable. .
We are obliged to export our surplus
product and sell in competition with coun
tries where labor costs less than one
fourth of ruling wages in California, and
unless we can get labor at moderate rates
many of our farms cannot be worked
profitably and will be abandoned.
Ten thousand respectable Japanese farm
laborers would be a boon to the country,
and would not deprive the white of one
day : s work. V-ry^trulj^r^.^^

fl THREATENED OUTRAGE.
REPORTS from Oakland are to the effect that
since the officials of Alameda County refused
to take from the State insane asylums certain
feeble-minded patients they have been notified by the
Insanity Commissioners. that the patients will be
taken into the county and turned loose without fur
ther ceremony. Upon that notification the Alameda
officials are now grappling with the problem it pre
sents, and it is a serious one, for the county has no
institution designed for the care of such patients. -
Upon the showing of the reports the notification by
the Insanity Commissioners that they will turn feeble
minded patients loose upon the county of Alameda
is essentially a threat to commit a gross outrage. It
may be true that the State insane asylums are not
properly charged with the care of feebkrminded pa
tients. It may be true that such patients must be
cared for by the counties from which they were sent
as insane patients to the asylums. If such be the law
Jhen there is a legal and orderly way to enforce ir.
There is a way by which the counties can be com
pelled to provide a refuge for the unfortunates and
receive them there and care for them. It is the duty
of the Commissioners to follow that legal process.
They are bound by the responsibjlities'of their office,
by humanity and by decency, to exercise a reasonable
care of the patients under their charge, and should
they carry out the threat they have made, and dis
miss into the streets a number of feeble-minded peo
ple, they would speedily find themselves the objects
of a widespread, deep and intense popular indigna
tion.
Sheriff Rogers of Alameda, in a communication to
the Supervisors on the subject, states there is no law
which permits him to receive into the County Jail
feeble-minded persons until after an application for
their examination has been heard in the courts. He
questions the authority of the Insanity Commission
ers to compel him to receive feeble-minded persons
sent by them from the State insane asylums located in
other counties, and asks: "If the Commissioners can
do so, then are they empowered to bring the feeble
minded persons without legal process? Must not the
Commissioners resort to the usual method provided
by. law, by application to the courts to have such pa
tients committed to the Home for the Feeble-
Sheriff Rogers is right in .his questioning, and the
answer can hardly be doubtful. Even if the Insanity
Commissioners have authority to compel Sheriffs to
receive in the jails patients sent from insane asylums,
they must still pursue the processes of law.
The issue is one that affects every county in the
State, for if the Commissioners can send feebler
minded patients to Alameda with instructions to the
attendants to turn them loose in the streets if the
Sheriff refuse to take them, then .they can do the
same thing in any other county. It is hard to be
lieve the Commissioners can have been serious in
making such a threat, and if they attempt to carry it
into practice the outrage will recoil upon their own
heads.
Tax Collector Scott sent two communi
cations to the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company yesterday, in which for
mal demand was made for the payment
of licenses due under an old order which
has never been enforced, and another
adopted by the present Board of Super
visors, which imposes a license of 50 cents
per quarter on nickel telephone machines.
In the first letter Scott called attention to
the provisions of order 15S9 imposing a
license tax of $2 per quarter for each and
every- telephone of -which the company has
been proprietor, from October, 8, 1S9S, to
April 2, 1900. Â¦ â¢
Scott also demanded the Immediate pay
ment of the sum of $2 per quarter for each
telephone having . a nickel attachment

LICENSES DUE
ON TELEPHONES
Judging from the expression Edward
Sigourney Cobb assumed as he proceeded
before Judge Dalngerfleld yesterday with
a recital of the woes his wife, Kate Maria
Cobb, had heaped upon him during their
years of life together, it was plain that
even the memory of the past abounded
in bitterness, ilr. Cobb. who is a civil
and mining engineer, with offices at 421
Market street, is seeking a divorce from
his wife on the ground of extreme cru
elty. In a cross-complaint Mrs. Cobb
makes like complaint against her hus
band. She even charges that he forced
her into a private asylum for the insane
at Livermore, and only repented when she
escaped and returned "to his home, willing
to forgive him for his cruelty and to for
get the sorrows of the past. Â«
Mr. Cobb took the stand when the casÂ»
was called and without hesitation entered
Into a detailed recital of the cruelties hia
wife practiced upon him. He fi?3t said
that he married Mrs. Cobb on December
2, 1S93. Since that time she has nagged
him. cursed him. called him vile names,
threatened to kill and malm him. and
then, entirely losing her self-control, would
act like one gone mad.
One of the most interesting: specific
charges of cruelty made by Mr. Cobb. he
alleges was inflicted upon him while they
wera living in Sausalito.
"My brother, Benjamin Cobb. and his
wife had just arrived from the East and
were visiting mo," said Mr. Cohb. "when
my wife was taken with one of her tan
trums. I was talking over old times with
my brother on the porch when Mrs. Cobb
raised the window, opened thÂ«Â» door, and
then, seating herself at the piano, began
a most unearthly drumming. She made
no attempt to adhere to the laws of har
mony, but successfully carried out her
intention to produre the most nerve-de-

THE ; NEED OF LAND SURVEYS.
' I; 'HE demand: for" a. renewal of the public lands
I sufyeysln this. State. has been made by the State
: .*.: Board of -.Trade.'. v' : At its last session the. Legis
lature considered this subject and requested action
by our members of Congress.
California has several millions of acres unsurveyed.
This land has mineral in it, timber growing on it, ami
much of it is fitted for agriculture. The intending
settler from other States continually inquires of the
State Board of Trade for Government land and wants
to know if it is surveyed, as no one cares to take
the risk of settling on unsurveyed public domain.
As these inquiries increase the amount of surveying
done decreases. With the exception of Nebraska,
California had the least benefit from surveys last year
of any of the public land States. As Nebraska has
but Tittle public land left, it may be said that of all
the States needing surveys California was treated the
worst.
The accepted surveys for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1899, in the various States and Territories
Arizona . .* 102,688 acres
California S.3S7 acres
Colorado 145,213 acres /
Idaho 788,503 acres
Minnesota 99,021 acres
Montana ...1,893,662 acres
Nebraska S.057 acres
Nevada 136,545 acres
New Mexico., 342,400 acres
Xorth Dakota 2.259,095 acres
Oregon 3S2.175 acres
South Dakota 1,720.404 acres
Utah 621,174 acres
Washington 637,636 acres
Wyoming 697.449 acre3
The total area surveyed . was 9,842,415 acres, of
which California had eighty-five thousandths of one
per cent!
The 'aw and regulations have taken away the over
sight of these surveys from the Surveyor General and
put it in the General Land Office at Washington.
Instead of an inspection of surveys by the Surveyor
General, examiners are sent out from Washington.
These men are usually theoretical and not practical
land surveyors, and they are far from satisfactory to
the Western people who are interested in having the
public domain surveyed. They seem to be especially
unfriendly to California surveys, and amuse them
selves with condemning the same, while no more ac
curate surveys elsewhere arc passed and accepted.
It is perfectly apparent that some bureau in the
General Land Office, taking advantage of the per
manency of tenure of the bureau and division forces
and of the impermanent tenure of the Land Commis
sioner, has so manipulated regulations and influenced
the amendment of the law as to centralize all author
ity over the surveys in Washington, depriving the
Surveyor General of the power which is the reason
for the office he holds. This bureaucratic policy has
been driven to extremes, and there is some substan
tial reason for believing that it is even able to con
ceal from the Land Commissioner facts that he should
know officially.
The General Land Office requires surveys to be
requested by settlers. The petition of three settlers
will secure the survey of a township, or 23,040 acres
cf land. One settler may secure the survey of 8000
acres by petition. It would appear on the face of
things, then, that only one settler requested surveys
last year in this State. The State Board of Trade,
however, has information that the applications for sur
veys of four hundred settlers in this State are pigeon
holed in the Bureau of Surveys. This means that out
of requests for the survey of 3,200,000 acres in Cali
fornia only one was granted, and about 8000 acres
were surveyed! Such a situation is insufferable. Its
continuance is extremely unjust to California. - .
The system of examiners should be abolished. Its
operation often costs more than the surveys exam
ined, and it is far less efficient than the former over
sight by the Surveyor General. The local authority
of the latter officer should be restored, and he should
have power to prevent the pigeonholing of the re
quests of settlers for a survey. They should go into
his hands, and his recommendation of a survey
should be respected by the General Land Office.
It is the duty of our members of Congress to cm!
this discrimination against California, and in =o
doing to facilitate surveys in all the public land States.
The other States and Territories, however, fare better
under the present centralized and inapt system than
we do. Therefore it is evident that some one,
clinched by civil service in a bureau position, is
amusing himself at our' expense, and this should

century was a perpetual school of the qualities
requisite for a good pros?, the qualities of
regularity, uniformity, precision, balance. Th!a
may have been of no great service to English
poetry, although to say that it has beÂ»n of no
ser\ice at ail. to say that the eighteenth cen
tury has in no respect changed the conditions
for English poetical style, or that it has
changed them for the worse, would be un
true. But it was undeniably of signal sarvlra
to that which was the great want and work
of the hourâ English prose. ... -
What made a good working prose Indis
pensable to the- eighteenth century was
the fact that modern life hart come ta
with 'All of its- practical and intellectual
interests. Scientific investigation had re
ceived a great impulse from the founding
of-, the Royal Society in 1662. Invention.-*
and discoveries in science followed one
another rapidly. It was the time of S!r
Isaac Newton. Boyle ami Halley. Philos
ophy, like science, awaited the gift of
popular statement that it might enter the
lives of the masses. The revolution Â¦ of
1688 had made public "opinion important,
and party leaders sought the services of
literary men who could create it. Sattro
in prose or verse was the favorite instru
ment of writers who would bring about
political, changes or advance moral re
forms. â¢ Nothing bears stronger testimony

Of this age of prose and reason, cover
ing roughly the first half of the eight*
eenth century*. Addison Is the best repre*
sentatlve. He Is chosen rather than Swift
or Pope because his work exhibits the
literary tendency of the period in sober
and moderate aspect. Addison Is never
extreme. His satire, for Instance. Is with
out Pope's stinging sharpness and with
out Swift's misanthropy. Moreover, his
personality as seen in his works and Ufa
is. admirable above Pope's and Swift's.
He is chosen rather than Dryden, though
Dryden Is a very Important name In the
history of prose. Dryden's position is
that of a pioneer of the period under
study. In the "Essay of Dramatic Poesy"
and the prefaces to his plays and poems
Dryden used a shorter sentence than his
predecessors had used and showed that
he knew how to rid English prose of In
tricacy and obscurity. Dryden'a fame,
however, rests mainly not on his prose
but on his verse, while Addlson's rests
mainly upon his work as a prose essay
ist. Dr. Johnson's famous appreciation
of Addisonâ "Whoever wishes to attain
an English style, familiar but not coarse,
and elegant but not ostentatious, must
give his days and nights to the volumes
of Addison"â has been repeated without
dissent By many critics of the nineteenth
century. It is almost exclusively In his
character as prose essayist that Addison
Is attractive to modern readers. His life,
save only the period of his work as es
sayist, may therefore be passed over with
very brief notice. â¢ ;

under Augustus: they had found it crude
and primitive â "unformed" is a favorite
adjective of the period â and had left it
polished, finished, regular and tree from
extravagance. Pope and Addison were
thenceforth to be the standards by which
all writers should be measured.
The present age dissents from this con
clusion, not because . it denies to the
Augustans suptriority in literary flnish
over their predecessors, but because it re
fuses to determine superiority on so nar
row a basis as literary finish. The present
age perceives in Elizabethan poetry and
drama qualities Infinitely higher, a spirit
both deeper and freer, an interpretation
of life that is stronger, and truer than can
be found in the poetry of the eighteenth
century. It also finds a similar superior
ity in the spirit of the greatest poets ot
the present century. But it does not deny
to I'ope the honor of having shown to suc
ceeding ages what literary workmanship
means. It ascribes to him wonderful skill
in producing terse, : precise, pointed and
balanced verses. And it observes that the
verses of Pope, have always invited quota
tion; that they, have the proper aim of
proseâ immediate intelligibilityâ and lend
themselves to the practical needs of or-;
dinary minds. Through well nigh univer
sal quotation Pope's verses must have had
an immense Influence in communicating
to English prose something, of their own
clearness and terseness. .- Â¦
To achieve correctness and elegance of
expression, to win perfection In style,
were the principal aims of. the leading
writers of the eighteenth century. They
had found out that there Is an art of
poetry, that it matters how a thing is
said. Unregulated by art. poetry among
the minor writers after Shakespeare had
become extravagant and fantastical. The
eighteenth century studied to avoid these
forms of untruth. In France a school of
criticism had appeared, the influence of
which was potent in compelling attention
to polished forms of expression, and this
French influence greatly reinforced,
though it did not create, the Impulse to
correctness and regularity of form among
English writers. At the beginning of the
elgnteenth century this Impulse had be
come dominant in English literature.
Readers were beginning â¢ to demand
that such ideas as were to be expressed,
though they might be commonplace Â¦ and
unpoetleal Ideas, should be set forth with
neatness and svmmÂ«itry- Commonplace
and unpoetical ideas were not to be re-
Icted if the style in which they appeared
was dear'and attractive: The French In
fluence'had shown itself most conspicu
ously In the Â¦ English drama. Voltaire
caUed Addlson's "Cato" the first regular
and reasonable play ever written in Eng
land, because it fulfilled the strict formal
requirements of French criticism, of
which the chief requirement was the ob
servance of the unities of time, and place.
The poetry of the age was for the most
part written in lines of five iambic feet,
the two adjacent lines rhyming and form
ing a couplet.- each couplet usually making
complete sense. The labor and pains ex
pended before Pope brought the rhymed
couplet to perfection told Immensely in
favor of regularity, condensation, point
and balance In all species of writing. It
cramped and dwarfed poetic power, but it
gave to the prose sentence qualities which
prose had hitherto lacked.
The age was critical in the sense that its
literary lawgivers demanded of Us writ
ers'a close adherence to formal rules of
writing. It has also ;been called a criti
cal age In contrast ' with the age of
Shakespeare and with the later period in
which Byron and Wordsworth and Shelley
are -the" loading .figuresâ periods made
illustrious by works of the creative Imagi
nation. . As the rules which .it followed,
were deduced' from n study of the best
works of- the ancients, it has also been
called the classical awe. The study of
models and the imitation of ancient
classics gave to writers a common stand
ard of formal excellence toward which to
work. Horace was the model studied
most closely. .His satires were imitated
and his "Ars Poetlca" became the literary
code of the age. To the widespread In
terest in the, classics must be attributed
the great success of Dryden's translation
of Virgil and Pope's translation of Homer,
as well as his "Imitations" of. Horace.
Though untrue to the manner and: spirit
of the original. Pope's translations ful
filled men's ideal of classical dignity. It
was easy to apprecinte o- literature which
set forth the rules by which it wished to
be judged in the form of maxims which all
could understand. The keenest Interest
was excited in subjects of literary Inquiry.
JVIen became concerned about questions of
correct. taste. Ancient writers were re
appraised: contemporaries held one an
other to standards Â¦ that all accepted as
true. A knowledge of the accepted rules

THE GOLDEN AGE OF ENGLISH PROSE;
Bacteriologist Green Completes His
' Analysis and Reaches This ,
Â¦ . Â¦'.- ' .-Â¦â¢ Conclusion. . .
That a "ButcKertown shrimp" is not. a
crawling vessel. of the germs of death ;' is
not a sea monster in miniature, laden
from its armored, back' to the tip of Its
tiny antennae with the ptomaines and al
kaloids, but fs. a .wholesome, nourishing
crustacean, has. been d'e-termined .by- Bac
teriologist Green of the Board of Health.
Thus one of the pet scares of the late
board will' no longer act as a. damper on'
an industry: of no mean proportions. The
old board found that the "Butchertown
shrimp" was a pale, unhealthy animal
that threatened to . breed pestilence
throughout- the - city,' and theix sale was
forbidden. Bacteriologist. Grepn finds that
the common beMef that these shrimps are
poisonous is incorrect,- and that they do
not live on the refuse from' the slaughter
houses. '.:--.
BUTCHERTOWN SHRIMPS
ARE NOT GERM-RIDDEN
WASHINGTON. May 1.â For the first
time' during the .fifty years- of agitation
of the project for the construction of an
interoceanic canal the House of Represen
tatives to-day entered upon the considera
tion of a measure to actually authorize
the building of a canal. To-morrow- the
bill will be voted upon, before adjourn
ment. ?}'vi.V ' : â¢ 'â¢ .Â¦
" The debate to-day was memorable be
cause of the. unexpectedly powerful oppo
sition it developed. Barton of Ohio.
chairman of the Rivers and Harbors Com
mittee; Hitt of Illinois, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, and Cannon
of '.Illinois,' chairman of thd Appropriation
Committee, threw the weijrht of their, in
fluence' against it, not because they are
opposed" to the building of the canal, but
because they considered that the time, for
authorizing its construction was not ripe.
Burton and Hitt contended that the. bill
would violate the Cfayton-Butwer- treaty,
which guaranteed the neutrality of the
catral. ' and ' Cannon .quoted- Admiral
Walker, chairman Of the Isthmian Com
mission, as saying the commission was
not yet prepared to say which was the
best route,. ' :
The anomalous situation is presented of
practically every' member on the floor pro
fessing, his friendship for the canal and
yet-of powerful opposition arrayed against
it on various grounds. Tha bill was ably
and .vigorously championed by Chairman
Hepburn of the- Interstate' Commerce
â¢Committee. Levering of Massachusetts.
RahsdeU ". of I^uisiana arid Corliss- of
Michigan. Mr. Fletcher of Minnesota was
the only member of the' Commerce Com
mittee who opposed the passage .of any

NEW YORK.- May Â¦ 1.â Business was so apa
thetic ap.4 aa narrow to-day In the rtock mar
ket that little can -be deduced to throw light
en' the busines* -or financial Kltuatlon. Prices
are. as a rule, slightly higher, but about the
only 'explanation, to be offered is that -room
traders In stocks proved unable to get them
down In ?plte -of. oce or two incidents rather
unfavorable to .values and turned perforce to
the lorfg eide In order to get the requisite
movement In prices to offer any field for trad
leg at all. Even Sugar, although Mill ab
â¢orbint a large proportion of attention, be
came comparatively quiescent and limited Its
range to a little over three points. 'The stock
' mn\pd both above and below last night. The
failure or the Pennsylvania directors to ad
vancf tttr semi-annual dividend rate proved
'ineffective to e waken the market from its
aiÂ«.tb- When the rir.all bears rather timidly
offerra Pennsylvania down below last night
without .bringing . out any apprÂ«-clable sales
the whole market took on a flrmer tone. Mis
souri PaclSc ros* nearly J points. But whether
the market moved up or down the small- pro
fessional traders failed equally to attract any
following. The closing was dull and heavy
end net changes were mixed. The local trac
tion stocks, led by Metropolitan, showed rather
ocute depression en account of the confirma
tion â¢ of the conrtltutlonaJlty of the franchise
tax law. New Tork Ontral rallied from yÂ«>s
terdcy'Â« depression on reports of a settlement
of the threatened labor troubles. A Fma.ll
thlprornt of gold was announced to go by
. Thort-day'e French Eteamer. It Is generally
Â«-Â»;â¢< -f-d that large shipments will be made
r-f-xt Saturday.
The â¢ bend market was dull and the general
tendency was rtactlonal. Total sales, par

Dr. John R. Fearn. the con of John Fearn,
one of the best known of Oakland's physi

it came ;o the question of marriage it
was found thai there was a clash bttween
the lav.-e of England and Calil'ornia which
made any other course than ihe one pur
sued impossible.
. "1 was divorced," explained Dr. Fearn.
â¢'arcorÂ£inK to the laws of California, but
not for a cause recognized by the laws of
Enpland. That made It impossible for us
to marry in England. I could not go to
Enpland and meet her and come lo lhi3
country in order that the wedding should
be performed. We decided that we would
not wait and were married by Rev. Dr.
Hill in San Rafael on March 10 last. My
wife has gone back to her home in Eng
land and will tell her parents. I will go
there in October ar.d will meet her and
her parents and will bring her back to
Oakland with me. A clafch of lawn made
the marriage necessary under peculiar
circumstances and we thought to keep It
secret until ehe returned."

The Berkeley contractors are not unani
mous in their opposition to the union
scale, and there. Is a feeling among the
union members that all of the trouble will
be speedily adjusted. * â¢ .
The contractors of Oakland have prac
tically made a unanimous concession to
the demands of the journeymen carpen
ters for a raise of wages to $3 50 a day.
The new rate went Into effect to-day, af
ter ninety days' notice had been served
upon the builders by their employes.
There was trouble with the building con
tractors of Berkeley and all of the car
penters there refused to go to work this
morning. The difficulty in reaching an
amicable adjustment was of a temporary
nature and at the headquarters of the
Carpenters and Joiners' Union it was re
ported that there would be acquiescence
to the demand by to-morrow. The rate
affects 300 members In this city. .
Owing to the absence' from the city of
A. W.. Pattianl, tSe only Oakland ' con
tractor who stands against the demand,
the carpenters were unable .to meet his
objections. It was stated by one of his
employes that Pattlanl's refusal to accede
was not based upon the wage rate, but
that he thought the Union had not proper

cy There were eight union men in his
employ who refused to return to work un

that there will be a satisfactory settle

proved by the Building Trades' Federa

K. H. Moore, an octogenarian, was
struck by a trolley car this morning: at
Fourteenth street and Broadway and,se
riously Injured. Owing to the advanced
age of the unfortunate ntan it is feared
that he may not survive the shock.
Moore left his home at 149 Clareraont
avenue with a basketful of .eggs, and in
his hurry to catch a Telegraph-avenue
car did not notice that a Piedmont car
was approaching from the opposite di
rection. He ran directly in front of tho
Piedmont car and was knocked down
and shoved along the track for twenty
feet by the fender before the car wa3
brought to a standstill. When the old
man was picked up he was bleeding pro
fusely from a jagged scalp wound and a
large gash over the right eye. Other parts
of his body were also cut and bleeding
and his clothes were torn and covered
with broken eggs.
The old man was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital and Drs. Porter, Ewer
and Rowe summoned. An examination
showed that the bone above the right
eye had been fractured. The other
wounds were not so serious, though It
could not be determined whether or not

PACIFIC UNITARIAN
CONFERENCE IN SESSION
"Well," responded Manager Ellis, "some
of the trouble is out fault; some of it is
the fault of the subscribers."
"There should be some way to remedy
this party line nuisance," Insisted Di
rector Sinclair, "and even the main line
telephone service is far from perfect."
Director Wixson said his complaint was
the indefinite holding of the line against
use by waiting subscribers.
The board of directors urged the com
pany to Insist upon and make good its
five-minute limit on party lines, and
Manager Ellis promised that something
would be done.
"If this service Is as good as you claim,"
Director F. Sinclair, asked of the tele
phone company's representatives, "why
is.it that you continually give people
numbers they do not want? Why is it
that on a two party line one will have
to wait forty minutes to get a switch?"
Director F. M. Farwell objected to the
prolonged use of telephones on party
lines. .
"From the amount of complaint which
is, made in Oakland," . said Secretary
\Y alker. "it does not seem that this ser
vice Is a decided success." â¢Â¦â¢ . Â¦"Â¦'â¢?- ; â¢
Manager Ellis said: "I admit that the
ten-party line *<"-rvice is not the best that
can be given, but it is very hard to locate
the trouble on these lines. As to "line
busy,' " said Ellis, "it is useless, unless
necessary, for an operator to say that,
for it is better to complete a switch and
eaKier to answer a call and ask for the
number that is wanted." ' ; : .
Secretary Wilbur Walker; who had been
requested by the, board of directors to
Investigate the telephone service, made an
elaborate report. He said that the re
sult of his canvass among the business men
showed three chief causes of complaint.
First, that the central, operatora did not
answer calls as quickly as possible: sec
ond, "L.!ne Is busy, call again"; third, the
Indiscriminate use of party lines.
Director . George W. Arper complained
of the great delay and annoyance caused
by the forced waiting for service on party
lines, insisting that the company should
enforce a time limit on calls.
' The protest of the Merchants' Exchange
agains*. the poor telephone service in Oak
land was met by all kinds of apologies and
promises from the managers of the local
telephone exchange to-night. The board
of directors of the Merchants' Exchange
heard the admitted statements of Man
ager Eugene J. Ellis and Superintendent
H. F. Fleming that the ten party line ser
vice was not of the best and the promise
of Manager Ellis to refer the recommenda
tions ol the directors to the main office.

THE list of railroad employes killed
or injured by the ill-fated engine 19
H . of the narrow-gauge system of the
the Southern Pacific Company was In
creased by two yesterday as a result of
the wrecking of the "hoodoo" locomotive
on the Alameda track halfway down the
narrow-gauge mole. The wreck, which oc
curred at 8:30 o'clock in the morning, tied
up every local train from Alameda mole
to Oakland and to Alameda and the boat

sen-ice on that branch of the ferry sys
tem was suspended until late In the day.
The "hoodoo," in charge of Engineer
George Sykes and Fireman Leonard
Hoover, was running down the Alameda
track, tender ahead, to take out an ex
cursion train to Sunset Park with railway
employes, the train having been made up
at the narrow-gauge depot. "Brick"
Drumm, a railroad mechanic, was riding
in the cabin with the engineer and llre
man. At a point near the junction of the
Alameda track and the track on the
mole nil, the tender suddenly jumped and
twisted off the track. Sykes reversed
his throttle lever and prepared to jump
from his cab. Hoover and Drumm start
ed also, but the engine started to pitch
over. The three men were thrown in a
heap on the floor of the cab, where they
were for a. second almost -smothered by
escaping steam as the locomotive pitched
over , on its side. ., They managed to
scramble clear of the wreck. When the
men gathered themselves together they
found the tender thrown on one Bide of
the track at right angles to the locomo
tive, which was a heap of wreckage on
the estuary side of; the mole.
The wreck was such that the broad
gauge tracks from the Alameda mole to
Oakland were blocked, the third rail being
obstructed. The company tied up its Ala
meda local narrow-gauge service as well,
but by a tight squeeze managed to get the
excursion trains by the wreck, although In
passing the cars scraped some of the de
molished parts of the upset locomotive.
. The cause of the accident is "in the air,"
so far aa the railroad employes are con
cerned. The track was straight and clear
at the point of the wreck. Two minutes
before it occurred an engine In charge of
Engineer Cozzens passed over the point
safely. Roadmaster Baxter Insisted that
"19" was in good condition. His only sug
gestion was that a brakebeam or some
thing heavy on the tender trucks had
dropped suddenly. There was no evidence
that the tracks were not in perfect condi
tion, v.
Engineer Sykes said:
"Drumm and I were talking about what
would happen if the 'hoodoo' engine
should jump the track, when suddenly* the
engine raised and began pounding away
over the mils. I selected my footing and
slid out just at the right time. Although
we three men were piled up in a heap on
the cab floor we managed to get clear or
the engine as It toppled over."
The death record of "19" began on May
22. 1898. The engine jumped the ' track
near the scene' of to-day's accident while
going toward Oakland with a long pas
senger train. Fireman John Hickey was
scalded to death and Engineer E. L. Bald
win was seriously injured. â¢ The engine
was repaired at a cost of $12,000 and put In
service again, but .the .hand of fate was
upon the reconstructed machine. On Jan
uary 31. 18M. while rounding a curve going
Into Alameda with a local train at-Fifth
street station the tender jumped the track,
upsetting the engine, killing ' Engineer
Henry Jonas and FiremamEdward Colnon.
besides Injuring a score of passengers.

after the accident, but said he would re
port for duty to-day. Hoover and
Drumm'a injuries were not such as to in
capacitate them.

Mrs. Amanda Ellen Henley, wife of M.
J. Henley and mother of S. Homer Hen
ley, Charles Henley, Mrs. J. E. Sussa and
Mrs. George R. Morgan, died suddenly at
her residence, 519 Golden Gate avenue,
yesterday morning. There had been a
party at the house the night before and
Mrs. Henley appeared to be in the best of
health. Yesterday morning, about 7
o'clock phe complained of not feeling
well. She rose from her chair to go to
another room, and on her way through
the hall fell dead. She had been com
plaining of heart disease for some time.
Arrangements for the funeral have not
yet been made. -
Sudden Death of Mrs. Henley.
Wrecker Whltelaw was soon on the
scene and by nightfall had hoisted one of
the cars back upon the rails and fished
one set of trucks out of the water. He
will resume operations to-day.
The damage to the property of the rail
road is probably small, but the direct
tralllc over the road by way of San Fran
cisco and Point Richmond will bo inter
rupted several days, until the locomotive
and cars can be raised from the bay.
Superintendent Walker said last night
that he was investigating the matter and
expected to determine the responsibility
for the accident. Yardmaster Peter Far
rell was not present when the accident oc
curred, having left the wharf at 4 a. m.
to go to Point Richmond. The accumu
lated freight that was to have been
shipped east la*t night via Point Rich
mond went by the old route.

edge of the apron partly out of the water

culty.
f7>? LOCOMOTIVE ar.d three empty
// \\ freight cars took a plunge Into the
/' l\bay from the" Santa. Fe ferry slip
Bt the foot of Main Street early
yepterday morning. The engineer and
lireman escaped an lnvoluutary bath and
possible death by drowning by jumping
as the engine hung for a brief moment
over the edge of the apron.
Just how the accident occurred has not
yet been definitely determined; It is a
mystery that Division Superintendent
Walker of the Santa Fe is now trying to
fathom. Engineer Lumsden and Fire
ttibti "Doc" Adams were In the cab at
the time. Lumsden says he was engaged
in switching the cars of the train that
arrived from Point Richmond the day be
fore, eh-ur.tlng them Into the freight house
to be loaded with eastbound freight.
From the switch to the apron, Lumsden
eaySj_is such a short distance that he
was compelled to take his engine on the
apron to pull the last of the cars clear
of the switch. The apron sagged under
the weight of the locomotive and down
the incline rushed the locomotive and
cars. The Impetus was so great that the
engineer was powerless to check the
train and jumped for his life, followed
by his fireman. Both barely managed to
pain a foothold on the inclined apron and
scrambled to safety just as the locomo
tive toppled over into the water of the
clip.
The locomotive and one car went to the
bottom In twenty feet of water, followed
by the trucks of the other two cars. The
second car. freed of the weight of its
trucks, floated out Into the bay and was

ARE DISCUSSING
MINIMUM RATES
ON INBOUND TEA
Transpacific Conference Gets
Down to Hard Work
Without Delay.
Committee of Steamship Agents Re
ports in Favor of Making Tea
Rate $1 25 to Points in
United States. x
The railroad and steamship men in
terested in the transpacific trade were
again in conference for several hours yes
terday. The only event, of Importance that
transpired was the report of the commit
tee of steamship agents appointed on Mon
day. They reported in favor of fixing a
minimum rate of Jl 25 per 100 on tea ship
ments from Oriental ' points to
all common points in the United
States. Because of the keen com
petition between the transpacific compa
nies this rate has been cut as low as 60
cents. Other rates can be fixed by agree
ment between the general agents.
The report of the committee was dis
cussed at some length, but no conclusion
was arrived at. J. C, Stubbs of the South,
ern Pacific Company maintained that the
rate of $1 25 is altogether too low, but it
was argued on the other hand that it is
as high as it can be made and competi
tion maintained with the Suez canal trade.
The committee has only commenced- Its
labors, and will probably have a' more im
portant report to make to-morrow.
Chairman Stubbs appointed two other
important committees yesterday, one on
outward bound cargoes and the other on
tho silk trade. In order that they might
get down to business without delay the
conference adjourned. early In the after
noon. The newly appointed committees
will probably be ready to report to-day.
"No one cart say now what the outcome
of the conference will be," said Mr. Stubbs
yesterday. "This is the first time there
has been any attempt made to have a
general agreement between the various
companies interested In the Oriental trade,
and there Is much preliminary work to be
done. It may. be that nothing at all will
come of the conference. When the com
mittees are all through with their work
and a vote is taken on their reports the
whole thing may go by the board, but at
any rate we will understand each other
better in the future."
Last night Mr. Stubbs entertained the
visiting railroad and steamship men at a
dinner at the Paclne-Unlon Club.
BURSOTTTS MILK IS

Board of Health Finds No Typhoid

The Board of Health Issued the follow

had filed a report that there existed no
typhoid germs in the samples of milk and
water taken from Bursottl's milk ranch,
which has been in quarantine since last
Friday:
"This is to certify that Mrs. Kllen Bur
sottl, conducting a dairy at Twenty-sixth
street and Corbett road, having complied
in every particular with the regulations of
the Department of Public Health, is here
by permitted to resume the sale of milk,
which was temporarily suspended pending
an investigation, and 8he may now re

POOL LOSES OPTION
ON REDWOOD LANDS
Unable to v Raise Money Enough
Within Given Time to Float
Big Transaction.
The option held by Holt & Gray upon
practically all of the redwood forests in
the- State and upon the milling plants in
that section expired yesterday and the
owners and manufacturers are again at
liberty to do as they please with their
properties. The scheme, which originated
about a year ago, was known as the Red
wood Syndicate. It took $20,000,000 to float
the scheme on the basis that Holt & Gray
made their calculations and it seems that
the enterprising agents were unable to
prove to capitalists that the investment
on that basis would be a profitable one.
Disappearance of A. R. Lawson.
