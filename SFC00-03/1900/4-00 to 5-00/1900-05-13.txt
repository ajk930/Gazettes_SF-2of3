Â«7v? DOLPH SYLVA. Latin and Greek
/i_j\ scholar, musician, actor, theatrical
Â¦M v> manager, chicken fancier, farmer.
lawyer and \ politician. So reads
the life history of the most interesting
witness in the Fair will case: Between
the lines Is a story more thrilling and
dramatic than any of the above occupa
tions would sujrgcst.
It is the tale of a man .who hurried half
the world around that he might taste
the sweets of revenge. Eut ever as he
thought to quaff the cup was snatched
from his lips. Fate stood between
Adolph Sylva and his revenge.
It is the story of a man who, with the
cry for ver.geance choking all els?, trailed
after his young wife and her soldier-para
mour until all trace of them was lost.
Cheated of his revenge he turned his bacic
on scholarly pursuits and ran the gamut
of human occupations.
All Marin County lincws Adolph Sylva.
but they know him as the wily politician,
ex-scholar, actor, etc.. etc. There are few
who would recosnize him in the ro!e of
a deceived husband.- frantically pursuing
his faithless wife. Yet that is ths part
Sylva played for many weary, fruitless
months, and that is what has made him
the man he is to-day.
Time was when Sylva squared his shoul
ders to the whole world and pluckily
toiled the steep path to scholastic hon
ors. That was before he was forced to
take a gulp of the bitters of life. It
poisoned his life, crushing out the best
that was in him and blighting his career.
"How many times were you married?"
was asked him during his cross-examina
tion. Glaring at his interrogator with
Bcorn and contempt he fairly hissed:
"Once, sir, and it was enough for me,
I can tell you.* ; ' :'V
Then followed the story of a chase over
half of Europe for his young wife and
her soldier-paramour. Tho same tale am
plified and exact 33 to detail was repeated
In an Interview a day later.
Adolph Sylva, frrsh from the University
of Berlin, from which he was graduated
at the age of 19. with the degree of doc
tor, of, philosophy, undertook to collate
Greek and Latin manuscripts for a pub
lishing house in Leipsic. The most hon
ored professors at the university had of
fered him a position ns instructor If he
would remain with them. But the other
offer was more tempting financially and It
gave him an opportunity to come in con
tact with the great scholars of Europe.
He Â¦ spent a few months at Cambridge.
[about the same length of t!m?> at Oxford,
after which he went to the British Mu
seum to prepare annotations on the works
of the English Philologist. Bentley. In
-due course Sylva visited Par's. Vienna.
Rome, Florence, and finally wound up hi3
record as a student at the Vatican. Rome.
He was gathering the ashes of phi
losophy before he had burned out the
fires of youth. Pylva was not yet so
steeped in dead languages that he could
not turn a pretty phrase in that roftest of
modern oresâ Italian. She was young and
beautiful and she fir.ally lent a willing oar
to the scholar's ardent pleading. One sum
mer day Nellie Savonarolla and Adolph
Sylva were married., and for a while nil
wÂ»Â«nt merry as a wedding bell. His schol
arly attainments and his wife's extraordi
nary beauty f.nd charming personality
brought the cream of Kome to their salon.
Adolph Sylva had delved too deep In let
ters to enjoy this butterfly existence and
.gradually he crept tack into his book
lined shell, leaving his young, beautiful
wife a prey to flattery and temptation.
There was a dashing English officer of
the Guards. Captain Burton Bennett, who
was always at Mrs. Sylva's side.
One -incrninjr Adolph Sylva woke to find
hla wife goneâ gone with the dashing En
glish officer. He was no longer the quiet
scholar, hut an outraged husband, mad
to kill the traducer of his honor. There
was a slight clew and he clutched It. It
â¢ led him to Tierne. only" to beckon him
still further to Spoletto. Here they Just
escaped' him by- a fow_ moments." On to
Flrenzl, through tho Mount Cenis tunnel
to San Etiennc, from San Etienne to Ly
ons, from Lyons to Macon he followed in
frenzied haste. Hither; and thither he
ran the phantom clews to the ground,
only to raise_ new_ ones. â.,.-
"Paris," whispered rumor, and to Pari3
Â¦> he went to haunt cafe and boulevard,
until, a new clew sent' him flying to'Cher
bourg, only to lead him on to Trouville
Sylva's life has been a potpourri of
ups and downs. And the "woman In tho
case" has been the cause of it alt.
Now and then in the telling o* his Hfe
story Syiva betrays that underneath his
calm exterior the old wound still bleeds.
The domestic explosion that fell upon
him like the hurl of a bomb shivered into
bits all love for the woman who once bore
his name.
Sylva then moved to Sausalito. With a
smatterins of law and a political pull, he
was the equr.l of many a first-class law
yer who came from Pan Francisco to aa
sail injustice in a Saiwalito court. Sylva
admits that he is a useful man and that
he has the savoir faire when it comes to
a question of justice tempered by poll
tics. He Is at present Town Trustee, but
that is not the extent of his political
power or Influence. Whenever local af
fairs arc in a tanrl? Eylv:i lends himself
with a ready and energetic assistance to
their unraveling.- He has nuiie cut out
of his life the tender and the artistic
side. To him men and their affairs are
his all.
Coming to this State, the scholar, lin
guist, actor, theatrical manager and mu
sician, tacked on another identifying oc
cupation. Ho settled, in Marin County,
opposite what Is now called Sylva's isl
and, and be~an raising cttickens. He-pros
pcrc'1 in a measure, slowly building up
p.n acquaintanceship that In these last
few years hds made him the Poo Bah of
Sausalito. a title which he glories in and
which he claims la we!l applied. When
this Poo Bah had become identified with
the county and sturjied its political inter
ests he became a factor in local affairs.
California was now his goal. His only
companion was his sister, whom he bad
brought out from London soon after his
father's death. V.'ith her he gave con
certs in some of the Eastern States, but
they were not remunerative. This sister
will figure in the present Fair litigation
and will be almost as important a witness
as Sylva hjmsclf.
AH over the middle Eastern States hÂ«
roamed with his orchestra, learning tho
first principles of barn-storming dramatic
art and laying a foundation for futuro
theatrical action. As a musician Sylva
was a success, but soared for higher hon
ors, and soon became assistant manager
of the company. At times he played a
part in such plays as "Hazel Kirke,"
"East Lynne." etc. The experience gain
ed In this first venture marked out hia
course, and Sylva upon his return to New
York laid plans for a company of his own
with which to tour the middle Western
States. Only partial success followed his
managerial career. In Evansville, Ind..
the company was disbanded and Sylva be
gan to thirst for something new.
Sylva could not brood or muse very long
after he had caught his breath in New
York City. His money supply was meager
and every day ate holes in the little that
remained. He first sought employment
at his former occupation, but to hl3 sur
prise discovered that there were no op
portunities for work compiling excerpts
from Latin authors into black-backed
tomes. When at Ecrlin his only recrea
tion, amusement and pleasure had been
the study of music. Even to-day Sylva
plays the piano like an artist.
So he looked around for an engagement
as a musician and was successful, inas
much as he became the'-leader of an or
chestra attached to a barn-storming dra
matic company.
Each new clew dissolved Into thin air
the moment it was followed.- Search as
he would, they escaped him, and hope
went to roost elsewhere, leavinsr only the
power of thwarted revenge to sear
Adolph Sylva's mind. His once beloved
work had grov.-n hateful to him. and he
determined to forget the past In the New
World. Heartsore, sick and broken In
spirit, he said farewell to his aged mother
and sailed from London for New York,
his native city, which he had left when
a lad of six.
and then back again to the mazes ot
Paris. From Paris to Rouen, then to
Toulon, then to Calais and finally to
London, whither the pair had gone to es
cape their Neracjis.
But London, like the other cities,
seemed to swallow them up completely.
He had positive evidence that they were
in London, but â¢where? For week3. in
fogs and rain, Adolph Sylva stood in front
of the Army and Navy Club hoping to get
within rhooting range of his wife's para
mour. Once he thought he saw the cap
tain, and was carefully taking aim, when
a flash of light from a window above
clearly revealed that the man was not

AND HIS
REVENGEInsanity Statistics.
The above figures are confined to the
regular army and do not Include the vol
unteers\of which there were a great num
ber In 1S98. I have, however, ascertained
the following regarding the army in the
Philippines:
The average strength of the army from
the date of landing nt Manila in 1S93 to
the present time Is 35. 000. which includes
both regulars and volunteers.
The actual number of officers and sol
diers In the Philippines adjudged Insane
during that period of nearly two years Is
portion of the people have pitted face**
showing that they have suffered from at
tacks of this disease. One reason is that
no efforts have been made to prevent It.
In some of the towns It was very general
and quite fatal.
In October I entered the town of Maga
lang, a small place with one long street.
and found thirty-five cases of this disease.
No care whatever had been taken to iso
late these cases. I entered one hous<Â»
where I found two women lying on the
floor dreadfully sick with smallpox. Sev
eral other women and children were near
them in the same or adjoining rooms, the
openings between the apartments being so
large as not to separate them sufficiently
to afford the slightest protection. In
other houses and yards children affected
with the disease were being carried about
In the arms of their mothers.
In. tho city of Manila records of deaths
and the diseases causing death are kept.
During the last six months of 1&Â» all
deaths within the limits of the citv. other
than those of our army, numbered 6203.
Nearly half of these were children. ThÂ»
causes were: Gastric affections. 1158: beri
beri. &70: tuberculosis. 3S5; bronchitis. 314:
fevers. 287; heart disease. 2*7; entcrocoli
tls. 2C2: dysentery. 220; intestinal catarrh.
ICG; meningitis. 133; gastroenteritis. 131:
enteritis. UA There has been a little bu
bonic plague, but not at ali serious. Upon
the whole the Philippine Islands may b<?
said to be a fairly healthy country; but to
enjoy health it Is necessary that precau
tions should be taken which experience in
that country has proved necessary-
Fevers Hot Malignant.
Dysentery In its various forms wa* a
complaint quite prevalent In our army.
"With care and prompt attention this
malady generally yielded to treatment,
but after passing a certain stage it
proved obstinate and often fatal, and phy
sicians frequently found it necessary to
recommend that patients be sen: to Japan
or to the United States.
Rheumatism la also an obstinate dis
ease, owing, no doubt, to the humidity of
the climate. Our soldiers suffered con
siderably from fevers: thfa wis probably
caused in *a great decree by tne larga
amount of outpost duty mad* necessary
by the army being scattered over a great
extent of country. The fevers were net
severe nor malignant: by no means of thÂ«s
character of fever from which the army
in Cuba suffered.
Dhobie itch was another diaease from
which the soldiers suffered: it was very
annoying and Impaired the strength of
the army. The physicians soon devised
means to effect cures and ultlmatelv thlJ
ments and have taken great pains to
equip their armies with very superior fire
arms, and I think the pistol used by
the Germans is better than any we pos
sess- _ _ . ' _ _ ;j^.ii-i-t:.S
Pay of American Soldiers.
The lowest pay of an American soldier
In the Philippines Is $13 30 per month,
equal to about $33 in the currency of that
country. Besides this he receives medical
attendance in sickness, and. when sick and
disabled, unlike most wage-earners, hl3
pay and emoluments never cease.
When on the march or in campaign all
of a soldier's time is fully occupred. In
garrison or in camp his duties consist of
drilling:, target practice, guard duty and
the necessary work In keeping the regi
mental grounds clean and In good order.
This gives him ample leisure, and he is
encouraged by his officers to use his time
in healthful amusement and v athletic
games. In time* of peace and while troops
are In barracks post schools are main
tained, which enable a soldier to materi
ally Improve his education. Every com
pany has a reading-room, which is sup
plied with newspapers, . periodicals and
light reading.
Insanity Among Troops.
The cases of insanity and suicide among
our Boldlers in the Philippines have at
tracted much attention. This Is probably
because there Is now a very general In
terest taken in the army, and is also due
to the fact that the insane are brought
home on ships, landed at San Francisco
and are taken across the continent to
"Washington, where they are cared for in
the Government Hospital for the Insane
at Anacostia. thus giving unusual public
ity to this class of unfortunates. There
have, always been a number 0/ cases of
insanity in the army of the United States.
The following table prepared from the
records of the War Department shows the
mean strength of the army, the number
of soldiers adjudged to be insane and the
number of suicides during each of the ten
years from 1SED to 1S93. inclusive:

All these articles are furnished to the

pines. If asked rejrardlng: the needs
of the t*nited States army there,
would reply that it is already sup
plied with everything that the rank
and file of the army could reasonably ask.
After five months' cloÂ«e and constant ob
eervalion of soldiers in those Islands and
a pretty general knowledge of the army
for a number of years, I do not hesitate
to pay that ours is the beet fed. the best
clothed and the best paid army in the
â¢world. And this is as It should be. be
cause the personnel of the I'nited States
army Is eminently superior to any other
In physique. Intelligence, education, en
durance, courage and patriotism.
The ration Issued to a poldier by the
Government gives him a better breakfast,
dinner and supper than is enjoyed by
r.ine-tenths of the people of the United
Btates. Fresh beef and mutton for the
troops is purchased partly In Australia
and partly In the Vnlted States. The price
paid by the Government hap varied very
much, the cost being sometimes as low as
4*5 cents and sometimes as high as 8 cents
per pound.
The meat is carried to Manila In a
frozen ptnte. and will keep in good order
seventy-two hours after being taken from
the ship, provided the conditions are fa
vcrr.ble, and it has often been kept as
Inns: as tforty-Hg-ht hours even when con
dition* were quit? unfavorable.
Soldiers Well Fed.
The losses in handling some fi.000,000
pounds of beef and mutton from Febru
ary 1 to December 1. ]S?9. were scarcely
appreciable, and these plight losses were
for the most part at a time when 'he
troops at the front were rapidly chang
ing location, thereby causing unusual de
lay in transportation of rations from
headquarters. The rations are. carefully
lnspected by officers and great care is
takrn that everything is cooked in the
best rv.A most thorough manner possible.
I very often accompanied field and com
pany officers in visits to the kitchens of
the soldiery Tihlle their dinners were
beinsr cooked, and also when all was
ready to be served to the men. and it
feemed to me that the soldiers were well
pleased with both the quantity and qual-

69 and the actual number of suicides is
29. Therefore the average number of In
sane- per year is 35 in an army averaging
35.000. or one case of Insanity to 1000. Tho
average number of suicides each year has
been 15, or less than one In 2000. There
fore the cases of insanity and suicides in
the Philippines have- been a little less than
the average in the regular army during
the last ten years.
There Is no doubt that Insanity has been
developed In some cases by violent at
tacks of nostalgia or homesickness, am!
as the distance to the Philippines is so
great this trouble would probably be more
marked there than any other place where
our army Is located.
When I went to the Philippines two sol
diers became insane on tlfo samo voyage
nnd Dr. Richardson, superintendent of the
Government Hospital for the Insane, in
forms me that three of the insane soldiers
received at the asylum were escapes from
the Kentucky State Asylum at Lexington.
The suggestion that a portion of the
cases reported as accidental deaths. a3
drowning, missing:, etc.. are actually sui
cides, is, I think, very incorrect. The
Pasig and other rivers are very swift and
the danger in crosslns or navigating
them is very great.
The Prevalent Diseases.
The diseases Incident to the tropics pre
vail in the Philippines. Leprosy has al
ways existed there, but is not very gen
eral and the people do not seem to regard
It as dangerously contagious. Smallpox
la found In nearly every town and a large
evil will be much lessened. ,
Pulmonary complaints are not very gen*
eral among the natives or the soldiers,
but patients suffering from them in any
form find It quite serious, owing to the
excessive rains and dampness, and seldom
recover unless sent to a dryer climate.
Generally in armie* deaths from disease
far exceed in number those from wound3
in battle. In the Philippines this has not
been found to be the case, which may
he taken as an indication, favorable to
the henlthfulnejs of that country.
During the eighteen months from July
1. 1SS8. to January 1. 19uo, the total num
ber of officers and men kille<* in action
was 473: other violent deaths were IK),
and of these 79 lost their lives by drown
ing: the total number of deaths In battle
or by violence being Â»>H: while the deaths
of officers and soldiers from disease dur
ing the same period were 707.
Principal Causes of Death.
Among the causes of death we might
cite the following: Dysentery and other
bowel disorders. 202: typhoid fever. 187;
smallpox. 100: malarial diseases. 4D; pneu
monia and tuberculosis. 41. The cases of
smallpox were largely during the first
period of our occupation. At that time
the officers and surgeons were not suffi
ciently warned, and when our men occu
pied towns they were brought in contact
with the disease before its prevalence be
came known. Cleanliness among the na
tives regarding their persons and their
clothing was a marked characteristic,
and I think accounts in a great measure
for the general good health cf those peo
ple.
I tbok special pains to as far aa possibla
encourage the observance of precautions
regarding health which I found custom
ary for the natives. Whether in canton
ment or on the march I endeavored io '
have clean pajamas provided for each
patient wÂ»en he entered the hospital,
while his own clothing, which was gen
erally soiled and wet. was being thorough
ly boiled and laundered by a skilled Chi
nese laundryman. who In turn thoroughly
boiled the pajamas, so that when used
by patients there was no danger of con
tagion. I became qnlte interested -In -
watching the general effect of these and
similar efforts upon the ureneral health
if the command. I visited the hnspitaU
near me very frequently, generally once
or twice a day. and I do not think sick
soldiers of any army are so well cared
for as ours.
Change of Rations.
In order to give the soldier the benefit
of a greater variety, troops are given the
option of drawing rice, oatmeal, dried or
evaporated fruit or other articles in lieu
r.t a portion of the fresh meat, and to
still further benefit the soldier, the com
pany commanders are authorized to ex
change any portion of the ration of their
companies for more desirable articles
This is always done by company com
manders when it is found to be to the sol
diers' advantage.
In caee of troops on Journeys by railway
cr on stages or steamboats the Inconve-
poldlfr without charge to him. .It Is truÂ«
the necessary articles' of clothing are
charged to him at the lowest cost price,
but he is credited with an amount- of
money quite sufficient to fully balance
this account, the amount varying accord
ing to the branch of the service and the
rank of the Individual, the lowest amount
credited to any soldier being: -
For the first eix months, first year $56 9i
Tor the peconrt six months, first year 10 77
For the second year : 29 M
For the third year 29 56
This money is only for absolutely neces
sary regulation clothing. In the Philip
pines It would be very rare for a soldier
to draw the full amount of his clothing
allowance, and the balance Is finally paid
him in rash.
It will be seen that the bountiful way in
which the army in the Philippines was
supplied by the Government left them'
without further needs so far as the Gov
ernment is concerned. The people ofthe
United States have been liberal in-sending
magazines and newspaper's, to the vgol
diers, which are very . much ' appreciated

I id itce ever gav* a thought to ner prediction,
he kept it quiet. On May day Sykes was
ordered to take an excursion train to Sun
set Park. Fireman Hoover and "Brick"
Drumm. a railway mechanic, who was
carrying a bell to the narrow gauge depot,
rode In the cab with Sykes. The train
was to be made up at the depot.
"We happened to think that it was in
May cf '33." said Sykes. "that the 'hoo
doo* lost her reputation as an honest en
gine.
" TVTiat would you do. Syksie. if she
Jumped the track?' asked Drumm. I saw
the slcker.Insr picture of Jonas and Colson
roasting to d?ath and said. 'I'd try to get
clear of the engine."
"We changed the subject and went
along smoothlr until suddenly, without
warning, the ensrine raised and began
poundinrr away ever the rails. We kne^
In a second *he v.-as at her olrl tricks. All
tiiree of us were thrown in a heap on the
floor of the cab as the engine pitched
over. "We got clear cf the wreck, but not
until we had almost been smothered by
the escaping steam. We'll all carry scara
from our bums to the end of our days. '
"Mrs. Colson always said I'd bs
the next man for the 'Hoodoo,' but I
guess the old 'Koodoo' didn't do her
blamed worst this time. There's
enoug-h of me left for hsr to have an
other try at."
But !f public opinion counts for aught
the "hoodoo" will never again run on the
Alameda tracks. The company may patch
her up as goo.l as new ajrain. but Ala
meda will have none of her. It Isn't pleas
ant to think of th* homes the "hoodoo"
has wrecked, of the women and children
who mourn thÂ«Â»tr loved ones hurried need
lessly Into eternity because of the "hoo
doo."
Xot that any one In progressive, mod
ern Alameda believes that an engine could
be really, truly haodcoed. Perish thÂ«
"thought! But Aiameda thinks that "hoo.
doo engine 13" would. enjoy a chanze of
climate.
pinionea, Keeping ium a wntrnnv prisoner
In the hissing caldron. "For God's sake,
old man. get me out." he whispered to
Sykes. Sykes bent over him and clasped
his hand. The hot flesh peeled off to the
bone and the sickening odor of burnt
flesh made him reel. Only for a second
he hesitated, and then bent his huge frame
to the task of extricating Colson. Sud
denly a pair of hands pushed him aside
and a moment later they were clasping
Colson's head. "I am a divine healer."
said the man, and my hands will take
away his pams. "D n your hands," said
Sykes. "I want to get his leg out." Peo
ple were row orowdinsr closo and othor
wlllinsr arms helped Sykes release the
scalded engineer.
Sylies went borne with Colson. The lit
tle bird l.ad been before *hem with the
story of a wreckage, but the names wera
juggled. It was George Sykes ard not her
land's lifeless body for whom Mrs.
Co'son wrs waiting. Dry-eyed she nursed
l'er husband the short whi!Â« life flickered,
nnd with so/row too deep to make moan
followed him to his grave.
All Alameda sympathized with the un
fortunate families of the dead men. Both
Jonas and Colson woft> very popular, and
the "hoodoo" that had raused their un
timely death was roundly cursed. Jonas
had left a scanty sum to keep the wolf
from his household door, hut only Mrs.
Colson stood between her bairns and star
vation. Alameda put its hand into -its
pocket ready to help Mrs. Colson. but she
was too proud ttf accept the proffered
subscription. She ha* earned a llvinp: for
herself and children by bending over the
â¢ewlng machine early and late.
Mrs. Colson is one of the few who con
fessed that ehe believes Engine 19 is hoo
dooed.
"George Sykes will be the next vic
tim of the Hoodoo," Mrs. Colson has
always said. And she insisted on it,
though the months winged by and
Sykes was doing duty on another en
gine.
When Bykes was put on Hoodoo 19. if
anfl 512,000 was spent repairing the "Hoo- *
doo."
Twice she had Jumped the track for no
apparent cause, but the men would nÂ«t
confess any rear or the Hoodoo. However,
there were false notes In their asserted
fearlessness of Hoodoo engine 19. The
railroad company is not given to consult
ing an employe's preferences, and the
men whr> were detailed to the "Hoodoo"
did their duty without complaint. It Is
not written In the history of the "Hoodoo"
that a man ever anked to be assigned to
her. Nor yet is it written to his discrace
that a man ever shirked the "Hoodoo."
So It was that George Sykes took charge
of her last month. . There,. .were peep!?
who; shook their heads when* they heard
Sykes was running 19. There wre rea
sons why Sykea should particularly avoid
the "Hoodoo."
When the "Hoodoo" killed Jonns and

The "Hoodoo" had more than lived up

LIVED TO DIE IN A MADHOUSE.
IT was nearly all fight from the very
beginning, but it 1Â« over now. Poor
llunkacsy!
There was eo little bat tragedy in
that half-starved life of his. He was hun
gry for so many years; hungry for bread
and hungry for art. Most of the happi
ness was what he gave to others.
The telegram of May 1 was brief. It
â¢was dated "Bonn," and this was the
amount of it:
"Munkacsy, the celebrated painter, died
izi an asylum here to-day. He will be bu
ried at Budapest."
It is more than three years sine* he
was taken to thÂ»Â» Bonn asylum. He was
Violently insane at the time.
When fame ard all the comfort that
follows in its wake had been achieved at
last he had only a few years In which to
enjoy them. Then came a stroke of pa
rayls's which caused the brush to be laid
aside, cud in despair he brooded day after
Â£ay until the tired, brain gave way.
He had only Just reached middle age.
Half of his years wera passed without
â¢ recognition. He was nearly 25 when "The
I-ast Day of a Condemned Prisoner" made
people stop and look. A little later real
fame stepped In. Then came a few years
. of Paris life in the studios which ha has
painted for the world to see, then the
health-wreck and darkness.
Perhaps It was all because of that sad
: little boy life of his. HÂ« was not quite
'-7 years old when he was left an orphan.
' That was back in Hungaryâ near
Munkacs was where he was born. So he
went to live with his uncle, and because
he did not like the uncle he moved across
the road to his aunt, and because the aunt
was still less congenial he moved back to
the uncle a?a.Jn. So between denials and
thrashings he spent some long, norry
years â for little boy years are the longest
In life if they are sorry. He was appren
ticed to a carpenter and. he cherished
smooth bits of wood left from planka and
carried them home to make sketches on.
He always liked best to make people, and
perhaps he painted the stern uncle nnd
the snappish aunt and vented some of his
feelings in that way. But likely enough
he did not make bitter caricatures of
them, after all, for he was big of heart,
and even when he was so young he raav
have known that they meant well enough
but were simply some of the blundering
people of this world who.^o not under-
At any rate, he chose to get away from
them as *oon as he oould. From accounts

The gloom of the world crept into hts

that a wondering little child casts upon
the picture serves only to deepen thÂ«
darkness of the doomed man.

, "Reforn)"
Such has been the demand for Colonel
Ralph de Clalrmont's highly interesting
book. "Reform." that the H. S. Crocker
Company has Just issued a second edi
tion. "Reform" is an Interesting discus
sion of the political, financial and social
conditions of the United States, in which
dangers and defects are frankly pointed
"Sho rsprar.g to her feet. 'How can
you?' she flamed. 'How dare you?
Thatâ'
" 'He cared for you â he cared for you?"
he repeated; 'and he never told you of
the letters.*
It La this Jealousy that brings matters to
b. crisis. Glennard la too big a coward to
tdl lil*Â» wife plainly and .directly his con
rection with the Aubyn letters, but finally,
iou;-. <i to a jealous fury, he accuses her
of clandestinely meeting the friend. This
Is a remarkably strong scene and very
cic-veriy drawn. The stroke Is boldly exe
cuted and shows the master hand, for the
dialogue is thrilllngly Interesting and yet
not unnatural or forced. Glennard receives
xnucii the worse of the controversy that
ensues. <md his wife's great and good na
ture is strongly emphasized. Mrs. 'Whar
ton's men are not the kind to admire.
Gkr.rf.rd's friend is not a bad type and
there Is an undercurrent of strength about
him and a suspicion that he really cares
for Mrs. <51ennard, but possesses force of
will and honor sufficient to prevent his
making a fool of himself, but we are told
little about him in the author's words and
roust read between the lines. Glennard,
however. iÂ« meet exasperatlngly weak,
but from the writer's standpoint makes
en excellent foil to play against his noble
wife. Here is the climacteric period Jugt
mentlonrd:
Trorn this time on he is haunted by
â¢what he has done â sold the private corre
spondence and thoughts of the woman
Â¦who had been so devoted to him. His
wife is a remarkably strong character
e:id high-minded woman, and he fears her
Bcornâ fears that his friend will tell her.
He gradually becomes jealous, entirely
without cause, and thinks that the friend
has found out his secret and will use it
against him the better to ingratiate him
self into the good graces of the wjfe.
These letters form the foundation for
the present story. Glennard falls In love
and marries, but in order to do so he is
obliged to sell the correspondence of Mrs.
Aubyn, whose name has become famous,
and for these letters he receives a goodly
sura, together with future royalties. He
negotiates the sale through the mediation
of a friend just prior to his marriage, tell
ing the friend that the letters belonged to
a ycung man now dead. His wife knows,
r.othing of the matter whatever, thinking
that he lias received an Inheritance from
some relative.
Mrs. Aubyn loves him as her ideal pas-
Bion and writes him constantly many let
ters purely platonic up to the time of her
death. ... - Â¦--
*' 'To be nearer you,' Ehe answered; and
the words dismissed him like a closing
door."
" 'Why go, then?" escaped him.
*' *I may never see you again,' he said,
as thougrh . confidently appealing to her
compassion.
"Her lock enveloped, him. 'And I shall
see you always â always.*
Mrs. Aubyn. the authoress, realizing
that her affection is not reciprocated, de
cides to go abroad to live. Glennard sees
her once before she goes to tell her good
by. In this interview, although he well
knows that he cares nothing for the
woman, that "he was tired of her al
readyâhe was always tired of herâ yet
he was not sure that he wanted her to
go."
And bo Glennard never really falls In love
with her. though his natural weakness of
character leads him to Bay many things
that a man susceptible to the flattery of
being cared for by a remarkable woman
would eay.

Just now a political necessity in England.
But Englishmen have been woefully mis

on the South African war. It would seem,
says Mr.. White, that English newspapers
have issued "sealed orders" to their cor
respondents abroad to furnish only such
news as will harmonize with the views
and wishes of the editors, varied by occa
sional abuse of distinguished English poli
ticians In the opposite camp. It Is neces

know, not the , Irreproachable sentiments
of the exclusive "society" man who lays
stress upon the English kinship, not the
views of the Wall street broker who
voices the financial Interests, but the gen

be accompanied with a system of mark-
Ing. The most successful method of
marking cards that has come to light Is
as follows:
The sharp first procures two small tin
boxes, puch as you- would put ointment
Into. He then makes a small hole in the
top of the box about the size of a dimo.
Inside the box I? placed a piece of tin un
derneath which Is a small spring, spiral
shaped. The boxes are then filled with a
composition of the following- ingredients:
Olive oil, enmyhnr ami stearin*, mixed
with analine nf the color of the cards. To
make thN composition- requires t a .good
d*al of dexterity, and ns the receipt itself
will accomplish nothings without tne
knowledge of maicintr it up 'no .harm 'can
be done by thofe nnvious to "experiment.
The advantage of this preparation is that
It can be taken off the card by rubbing M
on your coat or handkerchief. Armed
with the above; preparation and being
master of the Fjrccnii deal the sharp is in
vincible. Having m.iiked.- we 1 will Fay
the acrs and kines, no matter where they
lie in the pack, he can control them when
It comes to his deal.
I will now show tbÂ« methods of the
â¢very day sharp, who also depends upon
manipulation, but not nearly so advanced
a method as the foregoing chevalier de
rindustrle. The work. I am about to -ex
pose will hold good In almost any game
where there is no game keeper to protect
the players. If there are : any wise fish
Bitting In the g&me the. sharp usually Â¦ re
tires. . Bookmakers and sporting men gen
erally will not tolerate this work. The
the three nines together, put them on top
of the. pack, make a false shuffle and > of
fer them to be out. Tho cut being made,
lie Â«hen makes the pass, bringing them
bark to the top of the pack. If his con
federnte has a pair he make* a full hand
on nines and the next man who comes in
with h pair makes a full on sixes. If the
confederate has not a pair, he draws four
card* just to make his ante good, and as
h*Â» sets the three .sixes and one of theÂ»
nines bents out/the -man who makes two
pairs. This is not done at'evrry deal, but
about four fir; five timts In an evening's
play will generally win.
The two methods I have Illustrated are
boyond nil cavil and doubt the most up to
date.-': Years ago machinery was used by
sharps who c-.uld not manipulate, but

to tools of this description and the fact

mining .-camps and county fairs.
I will- now pass on , to the game . of
games; one that ought to be above sus
picion.. I refer, to whist. . In America
there is very lfttlo cheating at. whist, the
reason being; that it is rarely, played for
high stakes.': In*Europe the case is dif
ferent. In London, "Paris and Berlin .it
takes the .place : of poker from . the gam
bler's point of, view. Thus the sharp is en
couraged to get : in hln *; fine work. The
only i method â¢ by - -which : a Â¦ cheat can ' Â¦ be
successfully worked : without the aid of a
confederate la as, follow*:: -,.-,Â¦, ,
thirds of the pack are used. Euchre, be
ing the king of short-card games, finds
most favor in his eyes. To cheat at this
game does not require nearly as mucli
dexterity as at whist or poker. The short
c.ird man is" the worst type of blackleg
and usually finds his victims among tho
poorer classes,' most of his cheating bein;;
*lone in saloons. As his customers are
usually an illiterate class he Is not as h
rule particular what kind of .work be does,
his -object being to get the money as
quickly as; possible. -
For! short-card work a pack 'of, strippers
a"re -usually x employed. .-. For - euchre the
cards are trimmed, in such a manner that
the two jacks out of; the four usually -of
the same color can be drawn out at will.
This is accomplished by Â£ these two cards
being: a .trifle wider than the, balance of
thÂ© pack. When it is the sharp's turn to
deal alb he has to- do is -to bring tha
two -stripped jacks to the middle of tha
pack, 1 ; at the same time making -a crimp
as shown in the illustration.. His opponent
will, ninety-nine. times out of a hundred,
cut to it, thus making the two jacks tfia
last cards in the pack. It Is herethe'ad
vantageof working without a full pack
comes in. the sharp being : able to make
what Is termed the bottom : deal; this
sleight is the easiest of any used by gam
blers, and. â¢ like second ; dealing, becomes
Invisible with practice. Some sharps^ do
not take the trouble or probably have not
the ability to lea.rn.tha bottom deal, but
resort- to the extremely dangerous method
known as the "top r palm." Few. persons
would be blind to this method.
CARD r harpers ar* divided Into two
classes. One is the fin do eleclo
sharp, who, having the entree to
the best society, takes little or no
rhanee of being detected, on account of
the brilliancy of his work and because he
has rot to rush things like his less dex
trous brethren. He can afford to watt

I shall take the game of poker, to illus
trate first the method of the gentleman
sharp.
The sharps who can sit. in any kind of a
game and beat it can almost be counted
on the fingers of your hand; in my twenty
years' experience as a card manipulator
I have not met more than a dozen, and
they all depend upon one thing to 'win
out. viz.. second dealing. . All other card
manipulation Is as a turnip to an orchid.
To deal seconds so that they be invisible
takes years of constant practice. A man
must also be in pood physical condition.
as the slightest faux pas would mean
ruin. The object of the second deal
Is to be able to deal to yourself
any cards that will either help your hand
or weaken your opponents'. It must also
mere fact of one man being too lucky
arouses their suspicions. Outside of the
work shown In the first part of my arti
cle, It is not possible to operate without
the aid of a confederate. There are sev
eral methods of cheating with aid. The
one I will show is that by which the most
deadly results are obtained and is popu
lar with nine sharps out of ten. It Is
termed the double draw. In this instance
only one of the sharps does the. manipu
lation, the other acting as a stall. OnÂ«
of the advantages of this work is that
the dealer does not win the money, but
the confederate does. The sleight neces
sary for this work is called the two
handed pass and must be- accomplished
by a certain ability to locate cards. We
will take for instance a game of | five,
handed draw. The two hawks sit next to
each other, contriving if possible to have
the pigeon with the most money sit next
10 the sharp who does the stalling. This
is not absolutely necessary, but just as
well. Operation? usually start in about
the third or fourth deal, or just as soon
as the dealer has got the general run of
the cards. We will say that the dealer
has a pair of sixes and his confederate a
pair of nines. It is his turn to deal. He
will have located another six and nine.
He would then place the three sixes and
The sharp first locates any number of
cards of the same. suit. This' Is thÂ«
qulntescence of simplicity, as he has only
to pick up two tricks to.haye eight trumps
ready. Having: done this we come to the
manipulation required. Next to second
dealing this Is the most difficult thing tc
accomplish. The located cards are placed
on the bottom of the pack, It Is the
sharp's turn to shuffle. Taking the card.*
he deliberately Interleaves each half
twice in sucesslon. It . is the inter
leaving that does the work. He then
offers them to be cut. "This done

Into play. This pass in the hands
of a clever manipulator can be made from
eighty-five to one hundred times a min
ute. The work can only be done with
good playing cards that are aJmost new,
but as a new pack of cards is used aboul
every fourth deal in a -first-class club thh

"I was right in relying upon your gen
erosity," said Frederique.
She offered him her hand again. He
pressed it gently. She looked at him. He
had aged in the last two years, although
his hair was no grayer nor was he any
more deeply wrinicled. His complexion
was a little sallower, hia glance less keen,
less energetic. An aspect of weariness
or.d care seemed stamptd upon his fea
tures. Frederio.ue thought of the terri
ble scene in which the licentious desire
of this man had enveloped her like a
flame, but sOie no longer traced upon his
visage the same bold, insulting expres
sion, any more than she found fear and
auper in her heart.
They were tiJent for a few moments.
Durainberty moved his chair, and the
noise on the polished floor rang loudly
(through the big empty room.
"I am entirely at your service: you
know that very well," he stammered at
last.
Frederique felt that he was going to
speak of the past. She saw no danger In
this. ShfÂ» even desired it. for the situa
tion would be clear afterward.
"I have no bitterness with regard to
you." she snid. ' Â¦*.
"Is that truer*
"Quite true. I am sure you regret once
having wounded my feelings. 1 am also
sure you would not repeat what you did
that day, and under such conditions I
only a.^k to forget. If you like, let us
admit that you owe me a little debt of
benevolence. Pay H to the work I love!
That is all I ask."
He did nut reply, "I. will," as she ex
pected. Up hardly seemed to have heard,
being entirely absorbed In an idea that
tormented Mm.
"I would like to ask you a question,"
he said. "Will you allow me?"
Frederique bowed.
"I have reflected very often about the
incident To which you allude. I havÂ«
judged myself very severely. Yes, I was
stupid and brutal that day. My only ex
cuse, if I had one. is the conviction I then
held, that feminism and free love formed
one and the same doctrine. Enlightened
by the shock I then received. I have stud
led. I have read. I have seen the matter
from a closer point of view. I realize
how great was my error, and naturally I
have sought to picture to myself what I
ought to have done, what I ought to have
said, in order not to have shocked you,
in order ijpt to have driven vou away
from me."
lie spoke slov/ly and with an effort.
Frederique listened to him more inter
ested than alarmed. He continued:
"1 admit, therefore, that the brutal form
of my admiration must have wounded
you. But that admiration itself. In my
opinion, signified nothing- that was in tha
le.-ist disrespectful for you. You ought
not to be angry with me because I desired
to unite my life with yours. Or. if such
a desire angered you. you were in the
wrong, forgive me for saying so. Your
anti-masculine theories only concern
yourself. You cannot, or ought not. to
insist that we shall adopt them without
knowing what they are or without warn
in?."
"You are quite right," said Frederique.
"Perhaps I was a little too relentless, but
do not forget that I was very young."
"Oh!" said Duramberty, smiling, "you
are not much older now."
"But I have learnt more of life since
then."
Aprnin a silence fell upon them. Duram
bertV reearded Frederique with astonish
ment after her last remark, and ques
tioned her with his eyes. But she said
nothing more and it was he who con
tinued.
"You admit, then, that it was permis
sible to admire you. to long for you as
a life companion? Was it not, therefore,
also permissible to seek to tell you of that
lonsinp? I told youâ clumsily, I acknowl
edge. Do you know what It Is that tor
tures me now? It is to wonder whether,
had my offer been less brutal, had it been
more correct, more in accordance with so
cial eonventions; would it have been
equally insulting? Would It still have
been refused? Do you understand me?"
he added, almost in a whisper.
Krederinue. aÂ« a matter of fact, had be
pun to understand. And what she under
stood caused her some embarrassment,.
Although they were speakine of the past,
how could she answer truthfully without
wounding the feelings of the man whose
aid v.-;ip needed by the work, and -who,
after all. was both respectful and sincere
this time?
"Neither my sister nor myself," she re
plied, slowly, "had any intention of mar
ry-ir.g. for I suppose you allude to mar
riafre?"
"Ye"." ho replied, relieved that 'he had
not been compelled to utter the word him
self.
"We firmly resolved from our youth, al-'
most from our infancy, nevr to marry,
nnd whenâ when the little difference arose
between you and mo our decision was
made, firmer than ever. We had just as-
FoclatÂ»Â»d ourselves with Romaine Plrnit2
and Mil* 1 , de R.iinte-Parade In an under
taking ihnt called for all our energy."
"So. if I had proposed marriage to
you"
"I should siill have refused your offer."
"And you would have considered my
pronosltlon r\n insult?"
"Ah! no; certainly not. Although I did
not know fo much of life then as I do
r.ow, 1 cou!d not. as you say, expect your
ideas to l>fÂ» modeled upon my own. But
with that difference, the result would have
been the same. I should have left the
factory, and Lea would have followed me.
So we have nothing to regret, either of us.
Let us wipe out the past and pardon one
another the pain we have half involun
tarily in-fiicted upon each other."
Duramberty's face had darkened while
she was speaking, tl
"Still another quWlori," he said. "You
remarked a few mViutes ago that Ro
maine I'irnltz's undertaking called for all
your energy, a detail that had confirmed

fate of the school will have an influence
even now upon your resolution?"
At these words, obscure though they
wore. Frederique realized that a serious
engagement was going to take place be
tween the manufacturer and herself. But
this time the future of the school was at
ftnke. Determined to show her hand as
little as possible to her adversary, to say
nothing but what was indispensable, she
made an evasive gesture that Duramberty

I have helped to disarm this hostility,
born of a sullen hatred upon the part of
the clergy, who reproach you for being at
bottom simply free-thinkers because you
will not allow your school to become de
pendent upon the church, and of the an

There is a widespread rumor, that the
school is ruined. Brokers and commission
agents are waiting for their prey. Tongues
that have been tied hitherto are now wag

instruction Is Immoral and anarchical in
its tendencies. Without God and without
morality is the way the Semaine de St.
Charles sums up your educational pro
gramme. The teachers relate another
rumor, the extraordinary ignorance of the
pupils, an ignorance so stupefying that
the Inspector, M. Lecolnte-Dupre, was
scandalized by It and has sent a report
upon the matter to the director of primary
education. And, as a climax, ferocious
calumnies are current about your private

For a few moments Frederique remained
without replying. And then, as the si
lence became Intolerable, she said, sim
ply:
"I shall never marry!"
Duramberty did not utter another word.
He bowed and withdrew. She accompanied
him to the door of the room, where he
bowed again.
For a few minutes Frederique remained
alone and pensive in the big hall. Why
had her tyrannical conscience sealed her
lips and prevented her from saying tho
word? that Duramberty had solicited:
"No, I have never loved; I do not love any
man?" He had gone away hostile to their
undertaking, on account of her silence as
expressive as a confession. >
Pirnitz and Lea. who had been waiting
for the manufacturer to leave, came to
rejoin Frederique.
"Ah! Rarest," cr'ed Lea, running to her
sister. r 'He has gone at Ia3t! I was so
anxious."
"What has taken place?" asked the
apostle.
Frederique shook her head.
"The most unexpected and the most ab
surd thing In the world! He asked me to
marry him."
"Well?"
"Well, as naturally I refused him. he
went away, I am afraid rather dissatis
fied."
"He will work us some harm." said Lea.
They were silent for an instant, stand
ing close together, like sea gulls at the
first sftm of a storm.
"Ah!" cried Pirnitz. with a bitterness
not customary with her. "All men aro

CHAPTER III.
Tho little "Arts" lived in a state of con
tinual agitation since the ruin of Mile, de
Sainte-Parade, her paralysis and the hos
Â¦ tile coalition against the School of Arts
for \V omen had become facts known to
every St. Charlesian, facts that could not
be concealed even from the pupils. All
their youthful feminine nerves, hyper-ex
cited by the imminent storm, were tensed
and their young Imaginations were at
work. Not one of the pupils, it must be
admitted, talked of abandoning the cause
of the school. Each one invented some
characteristic sojutlon for the situation
which was to save it and avenge It. All
the little "Arts" would go in a body and
see the President of the republic; the
thirty red sashes would invade the grave
Imperial palace, they would throw them
selves at his feet and implore his protec
tion. Or they would address a petition to
the Chambers; they w.ould make an ap
peal through the papers to lovers of jus
tice. This youthful world, freshly gath
ered around big and new 'ideas, wanted to
discuss,, to resist, to' vanquish.
The mistresses participated In their
pupils' fever. By the side of Pirnitz and
Frederiqueâ the one ardently the other
calmly resoluteâ by the side of Mile.
Huerteau. animated by a somewhat "enig
matical optimism, and of Lea. who secret
ly felt the gladness of approaching libera
tion throbbing within her heart amid all
that threatened them, Daisy Craggs and
Germalne Soubize appeared to be the
most fervent, the ones who rebelled most
strenuously against the Iniquity of man.
who were ready to break violently with
society If it tried to tyrannize over the
school. Daisy felt all her revolutionary
ardor reawakening in the expectation of
persecution, whilo Germaine.no longer hid
her sympathy for a scientific neo-anarchy.
Her childhood had been cradled in
Daisy's accounts of the eviction of ten
ants, of Fenian plots and agrarian mur
ders. Her readings of works by the phil
osophers of anarchy, principally by grave
Krapotkine, had taught her their doc
trines. Later, in order to earn a little
money while completing her medical
studies, she had acted as reading com
panion for a certain Lady Mary Jackson,
the widow Â»of an Irish baronet. During a
period of six months, for several hours
every day, she had lived in the society of
this cold, hard, Intelligent and loquacious
woman, reading the most monstrous
books ever Inspired by a sentiment of des
potism, and writing to dictation personal
thoughts which were worse than the
books. Sir James Bartlett, a landlord in
County Sligo, who had taken up his resi
dence In Paris after a narrow escape from
an agrarian attack inspired by vengeance
was. a close friend of Lady Mary's. He
was constantly at the houso and was an
other frightful type of lordly selfishness,
utterly contemptuous of the life and lib
erty of the poor, happy In the miseries of
others as In an Increase of his own pos
sessions. Â¦ .
x. e S w i eâ¬ T these two creatures Germalne
-had felt her longing for emancipation, her
hope for a social revolution, exasperated
by the silent constraint Imposed upon her.
Her instinctive desire as an educationalist
Â¦ was to form young recruits for the war of
classes.- In this respect she was an apos
tle almost the equal of Frederique and
Pirnitz. who usually compelled her to re
strain her ardor, dreading a reputation as
a school of anarchy for their establish
ment. Bu_t since the work had been in
danger Germalne talked more freely amid
the creneral excitement. She had fewer
scruples about her violent diatribes
against hypocritical Philistinism, against
the oppression of the enemy, capital and
the tyranny of the Government in sup
pressing all attempts at popular emanci
pation. The flame of her rebellious spirit
reanimated little by little the embers of
Daisy Craggs' revolutionary soul, for
Daisy was the only one of her compan
ions whom she trusted completely.
Far from becoming feebler the mutual
affection of the Irish woman and her
adopted daughter had grown stronger
since they had left their apartments In
the Avenue de Segur to come and live in
the school, "that sort of convent " as
Remineau called It. Neither of the two
could have supported such an entire
change of habits alone. Germaine was
no more fitted to be enrolled in ranks for
an existence In common and compelled
to follow a regular routine than was
Daisy. Ah, how they longed, in those
vast buildings, kept so tidy. In which
every hour of the day had Its appointed
task, and where the regularity of the
Jessons, the meals, the hour v for retlrin"
gave uniformity to the days and weeks
how they longed for the happy disorder
the contented untidiness, the complete ab
sence of order, method, even of: security
that had rendered their lives so pictur
esque, so eventful, so pleasant. In the
Bohemian lodging at the top of the house

discipline. aSl method, weighed upon their
spirit, and any threat of punishment
would have driven them to rebellion
They were not menaced with anything of
the sort In the school at St. Charles but
hypnotized, as they were both, by a spirit
of dufy. they put a constraint upon them
selves. This voluntary restraint had tho
natural effect of reanimating Daisy's old
rebellious instincts, which had become
lethargic through a long enjoyment of
Independence in a free country, where all
were equal, and of heating in GermainÂ©
the mutinous sentiments that had fer
mented in ' her since her childhood and
that had been fed by Incendiary conver
sation and literature.
When, however, the first troubles fell
upon the school even Daisy was terrified
by Germaine's increasing excitement. The
girl manifested an angry impatience with
the silence and Inertia of the slandered
foundresses.,
"We ought to attack them In return "
she said, "instead of bowing our heads
and keeping silence! Give me leave and

Heurteau then risked an advance toward
several people, relatives or protectresses
of pupils, and who had formerly appeared
favorably disposed toward; the wort They
were received very coldly and questioned
suspiciously on the .rumors that were cur
rent. The blood rushed to their cheeks
as they realized that the honesty of their
management was doubted. The entire
population of St. Charles was evidently
going over to the enemy in a body. The
entire Municipal Council, the whole of the
Catholic party and all the official schools
were allied against the little "Arts." The
school had no defender in St. Char'es "â¢*
cept the extreme Socialist party, tfw
enemy of the famous "compact." But
the party had no leader, no influence,
and Its support even compromised them.
Some cheerful members having cried,
after a meeting one evening: "Long live
the little 'Arts" Down with the clergy!
Success to the social revolution!" tho
Abbe Mlnot Immediately drew an argu
ment out of the Incident fr>r tin article in
hlÂ« journal about the peril of tolerating

Duramberty was ri?ht. and Frederiquo
was compelled to admit It. Unless tho
work found some outside support among
the powerful influences of the quarter it
would perish. Mile. Heurteau assured
them that her efforts to arouse the Inter
est of certain great personages in educa
tional circles, to whom she had appealed

been fruitless. Germa'Pf went to see her

chief at the Baudelocque Hospital, and
returned sick at heart.
"The old wretch had even the courage
to guy us!" she said. " 'Ah! little Son

sort of Baron the actor fashion/
" 'Fem-ln-ism! And you've founded a

I read about it in the Matin, the feminist
school at St. Charles!' And he began to
laugh loudly. 'It seems affairs are goinrr
badly? I am not surprised! Women never
know how to look after business.' he ad-l
ed, chucking me under the chin. 'Be

not one of your old pupils I wouM givi?
you a very different answer!" And I eamr*
out, leaving him with his eyes wide open
and lips trembling, trylns: in vain to re
cover hi? self-possession."
Frederique then thought of a step that
would certainly cost her dear, though sho
decided to take it through a strict senso
of duty. There was in Paris a prominent
Judge and Senator, whose portraits she
had seen in illustrated papers, and who.
she was sure, would be ready to give her
his aid. A filial Instinct convinced her of
this. She was also certain of it because
this man on two different occasions had
made use of discreet Intermediaries to in
form her that he knew where she was.
and that he was favorably disposed to
ward her. But Pirnitz. to whom the girl
confided this project while it was still only
vaguely outlined, replied:
"No, not yet. What, could you say to
him? Our difficulties, 'after all, are only
flnancial difficulties. Nothing that you
ask him ought to resemble a request from
you for money."
"Oh! thanks," cried Frederique. "You
lift a load from my conscience. To see
that man and to plead with him would be
to drink the cup of bitterness to Its very
drega."
Daisy Craggs neither attempted nor pro
posed anything. In the first place thÂ»:
worthy Irish woman had very few friends
among the influential ones of the earth.
In the second she was a prey at that mo
ment to a more terrible anxiety than any
caused her by the fate of the school,
namely, Germaine's health. To the other
mistresses Germaine Soubize simply ap
peared to be a little more excited and
nervous than usual, but In the intimacy
of their sisterly life Daisy saw the girl
half crazed at times, roused to such a
pitch of excitement with indignation as to
suffer from terrible hysterical paroxysm?
as in former days. These attacks, which
had undermined her health during her
period of formation, had gradually ceased
In the mental tranqufllity and the atmos
phere of tenderness with which Daisy sur
rounded her. They began again after sev
eral months' residence at the school, but
they were infrequent, very slight, and
Daisy easily hid them from the others
The tribulations that befell the work, the
Iniquity of the slanders spread abroad
about the mistresses increased their vio
lence. Happily they had never prostrated
Germaine during the exercise of her pro
fessional duties.
It seemed as though her mental activity
and the satisfaction felt in a duty accom
plished preserved her from them. But tho
hour following a meal was dangerous, and
more particular her sudden awakenings in
the middle of the night from a vast
silence seemed to stifle the buildings. In
both cases Daisy, attentive and always on
the alert, nursed her cherished daughter
alone. Protected from prying eyes by the
locked doors of their rooms, she bathed
the girl's temples, damp with the perspi
ration of a mortal agony that made the
red locks cling together; her maternal
hands protected the dear head from tho
dangers of the violent spasmodic move
ments which flunx It against the Iron bed
stead, against the floor, pressed the groin,
whence seemed to push the mysterious
flow of madness, and stifled against her
bosom the prolonged moans of the suffer
ing girl.
Terrified by the frequency and the in
creasing seriousness of these crises, she
even secretly consulted one of the phy
sicians at the Salpetriere, who simply re
plied:
"The poor. girl must be married! You
say the attacks ceased after her forma
tion. If they have begun again it Is be
cause the patient needs a regular conjugal
Daisy did not repeat this diagnosis to
the young girl. She did not even teU her
of her visit to the Salpetriere. But the
night following the consultation she had
such a terrible attack that the Irish
woman feared to see one of the mistresses
awakened by the- girl's screams. The at
tack lasted until after midnight, when
Germalne fell into a deep sleep, broken
by sudden starts and moans. Sitting by
her side Daisy mused over the physician's
advice.
She ought to marry!" she grumbled to
herself, watching the slightest movement
made by Germalne. "That's the only
remedy men ever have to offer one! 'You
must marry!' That's their panacea! A
young girl la HI: quick! fetch a man, and
everything will t?a put riglit! Ah! they're
rascal?! It's one of their methods of keep
ing hold of us by pretending that they are
Indispensable to us for our health! Do I
need a man? And yet all my life I bava
lived alone and am none the worse for It!"
A long moan interrupted her. a moan so
faint and so full of suffering that one
would have said it were the complaint of
a tortured, imprisoned soul trying to es
cape. Daisy brought the lamp near thÂ©
bed. The young girl was lying half un
covered, for the night was warm. Her
flame red, curly locks were clustered upon
the white bolster. Pearls of perspiration
had gathered upon her temples and
around her eyes, mingling with the freck
les that 'were more visible than ever ow
ing to the extenuated pallor of her face.
All her features appeared frailer, more
haggard, while her eyelashes trembled ag
itatedly as though moved by an electric
vibration. Between her lips and contract
ed muscles the strange moan escaped that
had so alarmed Daisy.
The Irish woman wiped Germain*"*
damp forehead; the girl's lips opened and
she murmured:
"Daisy!"
Daisy's tender heart melted at this In
stinctive appeal.
"Dearest: Dearest! Dear little thing!
How pretty she is!" she continued, mut
terlnsr to herself in the silence. "How
graceful she Is, with her childlike throat
and delicate shoulders! Oh! Dear llttla
thing!"
"I understand why those wretches would
like a precious little flower like- Ger
malne. They would easily find a good
workman for her. who would treat her
roughly, would kill her with work, would
kiss her with lips reeking with alcohol
caress her with his grimy hands, and ruin
her health with children! Or perhaps they
would find a- clerk, an under clerk. That
would mean another case of genteel pov
ertyânot enough to eat, and measured af
fection. In order not to have too many
children! Ah! the wretches! I never
submit that dear creature to the authority
of one of those brutes or Imbeciles! Sho
13 too good for them! Besides, what should
I do without her? Tell me. little thins,
what would your stupid, old Daisy do
without you?
She stooped over the young girl, took
one of the slender hands lying on thÂ©
coverlet, raised it to her Hp3 and kissed
the finger tips like a mother with her
sleeping child. The echo of the words ut
tered by the doctor at the Salpetrlere
rang In her ears:
â¢Unless you get that girl married her
sex will revenge Itself In one way or an
other. She will do something irreparable,
and that won't be very pleasant!"
Daisy Craggs did not ask what kind of
irreparable action Germaine was capable
of committing. She had some inkling
what it was! Ah. if Germalne could only
free herself, could only be cured, without
marriage, without separation from her
adopted mother! Â¦ .

excuse me for revealing such infamous
details to you. but it is best that you
should be warnedâ to protect the mis
tresses from the consequences of their con
duit."
"Oh!" cried Frederique. "What an out
rage!"
"Yes, an outrage. Nevertheless, certain
facts are mentioned. One of your com
panions has left the school with a work
ing sculptor."
"It's not true!" cried Frederique. "Duy
veefce Hespel is the purest girl in the
world. She went to nurse the man's child
in an admirable spirit of self-sacrifice, and
she will certainly marry Remineau, but
until the marriage takes place I am sure
thatâ"
"I believe you! I believe you!" Inter
rupted Duramberty. "Still any one else
would simply laugh at such an explana
tion. Finally, you are accused of being
cosmopolitans, of having no country, of
being a gathering of English women,
Jewesses, Germans find Poles. This Is
probably the grievance that has most

that I could see it! Not once did you
cast a glance at the house, nay house,
where, nevertheless, for several years
you had been treated with kindness and
friendship, and which you left after a re
grettable incident. I admit, but one that
no other woman would have condemned
so severely as you did!"
Genuine emotion animated Jude Duram
berty's voice, although it still remained
respectful in toneâ a tone that calmed all
uneasiness and rebellious Inclination In
Frederique. She was astonished at her
own tranquillity, and thoughtâ "How
my heart has changed! I understand
now what this man is saying to me. I
feel pity for him, because I have suf
fered. I have realized how impossible it
is for one to govern one's heart!"
Duramberty continued:
"Try to imagine what my life has been
for two years. I do not wish to appear
sentimental. Oh. no! And I have often
despised myself for being so little mas
ter of my own feelings. But it is a logi
cal fact, against which everything else is
powerless, that a certain woman stands
above all others for a certain man, and
that his happiness depends upon an agree
ment with her and upon her-loving pres
ence. This is what I tried not to be
lieve, and yet I have been compelled to
admit it is so. At 4S I have begun to be
disgusted with my work, with my pro
jects, with the women who render most
men happy. I am neither sentimental
nor sickly, but I know, I am sure, that
I shall know no rest except near you. Oh.
don't be alarmed! You must surely feel
that I am not going to repeat the insane
proposition I made two years ago. But I
may tell you I came here. In spite of all
my former inclinations, with the desire,
of settling my life. Don't say anything!
Don't fay no! Listen to me! I offer to
It rendered her gentler to the .man. And
in spite of all her hatred for*the legal
bargain offered her, she did not reject
it brutally, neither with, bitter words nor
scornful gestures. Even her face, her
grave visage, with its noble outline, did
not change. Her glance was fixed with
out any anger upon the speaker.
She was silent, for she could not find
words with which to reply. The idea of
profiting from Duramberty's agitatio\i. of
deceiving him, or of putti/ig him off with
vague promises, never even entered her
mind. >Â» But- she was terrified Â¦ by the
thought that the words she was going to
utter would decide the fate of the school.
For Duramberty spoke truly, and B red
erique was too intelligent not to under
stand himâ nothing save his iniluence
could disarm the hostility threatening
them from all sides.
While she was seeking how, without
falsehood and without binding herself,
she could touch this masculine heart, how
she could lead it to what he called iron
ically an effort of sentimental heroism,
Duramberty interpreted her silence as
consent. He continued his pleading:
"I do not ask you to take tin immediate
resolution. Only teH me that you are not
unbendableâ that you will think over the
matterâ that it is possible! I will not
hurry you! You will allow me to see you
for a few seconds every day. to try ana
convince you by learning a little more of
you. and by showing myself to you under
a form other than that of an employer
with his employeâ for our relations, after
all, have never been anything else! Be
kind to me! Do not take all hope from
me! Have pity for thef sadness of my
lifp â alone â always alone!" â¢ â¢
His voice trembled as ho uttered the
last words, and they were little more
than a broken murmur. This strong man,
who was playing his future upon a wo
man's reply, 1 trembled? was softened, and
his eyes were full of tears. Frederlque's
conscience revolted at the thought of mis
leading Mm, of profiting from his trou
ble. She made up her mind suddenly.
"See me? You may do that as 'often as
you please! TheYe is no difficulty about
that. I should be very glad, you know it!

tection that would seem rather heroic.
Still, the rumor was currentâ I don't
know why, and I did nothing to strength
en it â that I felt an interest In your sister
and you, in short, that I protected you
both. Well, such a rumor was quite suf
ficient. It was sufficient that people Im
agined they could perceive a masculine
power supporting your undertaking for
them to hesitate about troubling you dur
ing a year and a half!. Such is the In
fluence of a man in this anciant society of
ours, an Influence established for centu
ries upon the work and the authority of
man." â¢
"Perhaps you are right." said Frede
rique. "Yes. man is all powerful, and he
is armed against us. No matter, we shall
fight! If we succumb, others will take
our places. Every reform necessitates
sacrifices In money and human life."
"Reformers might diminish such sacri
fices by a little foresight and diplomacy.
Instead of Hying in the face of accepted
modes of education, what hindered you
from interesting some personage in your
work, some politician or academlcan, who
would occupy himself In' the matter In. a
purely perfunctory way? Or, if you like.
In this curious little place, the suburb of
St Charles, would it not have been wise
to win over to your side some of the local
Influences, to have constituted a support
ing party?. Look around you. You see
convent schools, hospitals marfagqd by
nuns, all flourishing feminist enterprises.
They have been attacked often, and yet
they exist. Why? Because they are sup
ported by a powerful group of men, the
clergy"
Frederique shook her head. /
"What men could we appeal to? ' Who
among them would have espoused the
cause of our party and at the same time
would have respected our doctrines?"
"I know one, at any rate." /replied- the
manufacturer. "Yes, I: myself! Â¦ I was
ready to give you not alone the- friendly
neutrality which, all the same, has suf
ficed to preserve youjup to the, present,
but an active and, I assure you, a liberal
protection. , â¢ I : tried to make you under
stand this by founding Â¦ a scholarship ; In
your school, by offering you the gratul-
the work that you love, to which you
have devoted your youth, all the Influence
I have in this quarterâ and you know that
It is all powerfulâ without asking in .ex
change the slightest right of interference
or Inspection. I offer it to you and I
also offer you my name!"
With a respectful gesture he stopped
Frederique, who was going to interrupt
him.
"You told me a few moments ago," he
continued, "that such nn offer would not
have been insulting. I offer you my name,
and I beseech you to accept it! I can no
longer live ao near you and without you!
If I cannot win you 1 prefer that your
school should disappear, for, at loast,' in
that case I should no longer have to sup
port the torture of seeing you every day
without speaking to you. without daring
to approach you. Do not refuse! Remem
ber, you are quite independent. Why
should you not use the right you accorded
to Duyvecke Hespel? Emancipate your
self, particularly as in doing so you save
your school! I shall do nothing against it
under any circumstances, but if I must go
away without a reply to give me a little
hope I shall abstain from all action one
way or the other. I shall leave irresistible
forces to destroy you. I do not pride my
self on any sentimental heroism. Tell me
that you do not absolutely reject rsv prop
osition! Is it quite inacceptable? r^i do
not love me? That may be! But you have
some esteem for my energy, I know. Our
intellects understand and complete each
other. At our age that is the most impor
tant, is it not?
"Givo me the care of winning you. You
will be a mother; your children will make
you love your husband. Ah! do not chut
your heart and mind against me. Have a
little pity on the man who was the first
to give you the joy of earning your live
lihood, and without whom, after all, the
great work which has cost you so much
effort could not have begun. Believe me.
I am pointing out to you the true path!
I respect you so! I love you so! You can
not be unhappy with me!"
He spoke with a restrained warmth that
took any ludicrous feature from his unex
pected proposal of marriage. Frederique
listened to him, and her lucid mind real
ized the weight of all he said. She
thought:
"Here, once more, under, its conventional
and accepted form, is the eternal bargain,
'Give me yourself and I will give you my
money and my protection.' That is mar
riage! And this man, at least, has the ex
cuse of having suffered and of being disin
terested. And. warned: by his first at
tempt, he expresses himself In excellent
terms, which could not possibly arouso
any rebellious feeling. Yet I prefer his
first. manner, which so revolted me. The
bargain was more frankly presented. It
was not decorated by any hypocritically
respectful form."
When he spoke of children, of their life
side by side, their minds balancing each
other, she blushed. He believed her to be
touched But really her mind had evoked
the past, had called :; up in her mental
vision the figure of Georg : Ortsen, had
awakened memories of their" fraternal
communion in London and of ; the vaguo
dreams that she had then repulsed, only
to find that they imposed themselves upon
her later. She also had suffered the tor
ture of living near, a being whom she had
yearned for, and who could not and would
not belong to her. ., In Jude Duramberty's
pleading, "Have a little pity upon me!"
she heard the echo of her own' heart. And
emotion, "then I may hope?"
"No. I do not want there to tie any
misunderstanding between us! I shall
never marry. Besides, I repeat, there Is
nothing personal to you in my decision.
I have made a contract with myself, you
know It. Why should you force me to
utter a rejection which you foresaw? No
one will ever be my husband. No one!
Will you bear me a grudge for a decision
taken in my childhood?"
Durambery listened to her motionless.
He said nothing. He waited for her to
continue speaking. When she . ceased,
suffering horrible anguish, he asked in
a changed tone, in a voice that seemed
to have paled: â¢
"Is itâ a sort of vow â a religious vow?"
"No, it is ' a decision, logically taken,
so a3 to be free in order to work better
for the emancipation of woman. Do not
seek for other motives: it Is the only one.
I jrive you my word."
There was another short silence. Then
Duramberty, in a voice that had recov
ered all its firmness and imperious ring,
asked:
"Butâ suppose marriage could serve the
cause which is so precious to you â the
feminist cause? It 19 the case, in the
present instance: You could not do a
greater harm to your work than to persist
in your celibacy."
The fight between the two beings who
a few minutes before had felt an obscure
svmpathy for each other began again, a
ffght that, although masked, was still
keen.
"It Is possible," replied Frederlcjue,
"that I may do momentary harm to my
work in refusing your offer. But what
about to-morrow? What about the fu
ture, the course of life? Who knows what
the result will be? My liberty is the one
certain benefit that 1 can offer to the
cause of woman's emancipation. In mar
rying I should betray that cause."
"Thenâ it is definite â you refuse?"
"Must I repeat that this decision Is not
addressed to you personally, sir? Have
sufficient generosity not to bear animosity
for an old vocation, and, above all, above
all, do not think of making others, inno
cent ones, suffer for the bitterness with
which you will probably regard me."
"I have already told you that I shall
never help to hasten the ruin of your un
dertaking. I simply wash my hands of
it, and that not through any; ill will, but
because "it will be so painful â¢ for me In
future to be in touch either from at hand
or from afar with the affairs of this es
tablishment. I shall never be your enemy,
that I promise you."
"Thank you," said Frederique.
She felt, i in spite of his pacific words,
that anger, aroused by defeat, was gath
ering In * Duramberty's heart.
"Will -you allow me to ask one thing
moreâ one single questionâ and I will go
away?"
Frederique acquiesced with a sign of
her head,
."You spoke of a- vocation, of a sort of
Imperative duty that prevents you Â¦ from
marrying. Your refusal, you say, has
nothing to do with me personally. Am I
to understand that never; with regard to
any living man, have " you thought of
marriage?".
Frederique reflected for .' a moment.
"I have never dreamed and never shall
dream of marriage."
"With any one?'.' '
"Never with any one." '
VOh!â pardon . me." - said Duramberty,
lowering his: voice; "the question Is ab-
With a little genuine confusion which
favorably disposed the young girl toward
him, he murmured :
"I thank you for your welcome, Mile.
Frederic ue. I thank you very sincerely !"
She offered him a peat.
"I also." she replied, "I am also grate
ful to you. sir. for coming here with
friendly intentions. Mile. Heurteau told
me thrt you listened to her with benevo
lent Interest."
She sought from the first words to win
him over, to profit from the advantage
the past gave her over the man. She de
scribed in rac-asured, precise terms the
school's situationâ a r'tuatlon that was
not desperate, that was even excellent for
the near future, upon the condition that
the foundress* efforts v.erÂ« not paralyzed
\jv sudden demands of creditors.
""It iÂ«j my firm conviction that within
four or live years the School of Arts for
Women, managed as it has been from the
beginning, will be an admirable business
affair, evrn from a monetary point of
view. We have enough to live upon for
the whole of nort year. During that time
we shall certainly be able to find the capi

have lost. There is only one pressing
questionâ your securityâ and we ask you
not to aggravate our difficulties. No

as in Fredorique's case, time mi^ht have
softened for him the bitterness and Insult
of her refusal. For, more familiar v.-ith
life, now that her htart had Buffered, now
that she knew ell the anguish of loving a
human creature with a;i unrequited love.
Frefierfopie was far from judging Durain-
Ixrty's action with the same harsh re
lc:ulessness. She now understood the
vcrds rircitz had then ottered:
"He is a man like other men. brought
â¢up suno&g ordinary prcjucices, and he de
sires you. People call such arrogant
egotism by the name of love, and the ma
jority of women are proud of awaking
it:"
"Yes," thought Frcderlque, "Pirnitz was
right. Duramberty longed for me, self

"And now he has asked for another in

cert-aiti he would not renew h'.s former at
tempt. "He is loo intelligent and too
proud." Bnt what could be the meaning
of hiss demand? The girl was inclinr-d to
1 .v that he pimply wished to efface
the past Incident, a desire that she
shared, for, in spite of all. she still re
tained an admiration for the virile labor
and active mind of her former employer.
They would have a definitive explanation,
would shake hands, and Fredi.-riq.ue, Â¦ in

liirn, could a=K LÂ»uramberty loyally not
to act In enmity toward the w^rk. She
mipht even obtain from him a . promise

would use his influence to defend it.
This hypothesis and hope was con

Â¦paid. "He <Md not seem to be animated
by any hostile sentiment. If any one can
decide him to adopt a pronouncedly fa
vorable attitude toward us I have an im
preMlon that it is Frederique. And we
must â we must â we znust have Duram
berty on our side!"
When Pirnitz was consulted on the mat
ter she did not disapprove of the inter
vit-v. though she daix-d not count upon a
lavorali'e result.
"It will either end in an agreement or
in a rapture," she said, "and the probabil
ities are th~t it will be a rupture. How
ever, an avowed enemy is better than an
uncertain ally."
Lea was the only on/who opposed the
Idea, and she did oppose it with all her
strength. More Imaginative, more sensi
tive, mors nervous than Frederique, and
with all these characteristics accentuated
by recent events, she had still present' in
her mind the memory of the scen2 in the
factory two years before, when Frede
rique, crazed by her employer's proposi
tion, had found refuge in her younger
Eister's arms.
All her tenderness awoke, stronger than
Jealousy and rancor, now that the felt
an apprehension of terror.
VTltii her arms clashed around Freder-
Jque's neck, she pleaded pitifully â
"I beg of you, Fedi, I pray you! Don't
receive tha.t wretch! Don't remain alone
with him a minute."
Ocrmaine Soubize. whose excitement had
tot-fun to arouse anxiety now that mascu

by a company organized at Kssen-Ruhr,'

"The chemical compound patented by'
Dr. Goldschmidt," said Dr. Alexander'
Smith of the chemical laboratory of thel
University of Chicago, *is undoubtedly a
mixture of oxide of Iron, the ordinary)
powdered hematite, with a mixture of.
powdered aluminum. .
"We have tried several experiments In.
the solution of iron out here and with the
service of these compounds have been able,
to melt very large Iron nails in an incred
ibly short space of time. .The compounds'
produce a violent chemical action, a sort'
of fireworks explosion. The mass la placed I
in a crucible, which Is heated at one point'
and quickly spreads throughout thel
whole. The German patent Is able to
make iron, while at the same time iti
melts that already formed. One of Its
chief services is the formation of chrom-j
ium and manganese. Pure chromium can.
be produced by means of the German
compound. It was formerly made in an!
electric furnace and, , fashioned in this
manner, was allied with carbon. Now it
can be 1 made In a pure state by means
of the Iron oxide mixed with aluminum."'
The German company hopes to see Its

now what has become of the tailor or

Regarding the Coming Census.
In thirteen actual working days the
twelfth census of the United States is to
be taken. The law provides that the work
shall be done between June 1 and June 15,
and as there are two Sundays In that pe
riod this year there will be just thirteen
days to devote to the task.
The vaetness of this work is something
hard to realize. There are some 70.000,000
people to be counted and asked all sorts of
questions as tp birth, dncestry,, nativity,
age, education, work, social position, con
nubial condition and all that. One would
think that the. simple counting of 70,000,000
people in thirteen days would be a huge
enough task, to say nothing of doing the
other work that census taking in these
days entails.
The questions that the enumerators will
ask will be numerous, but they will not
include some of those which were consid
ered most objectionable in 1890. j These are
aboli6hed, not because the people objected
to answering them, but because they
proved to be utterly worthless as a basis
for statistics on chronic diseases, for
which they were designed. The questions
this year will be: (
1. ' Surname. Christian name. Initial.
2. Residence, street, number of house.
3. Relationship of each member ta the
head of family
4. Color or race.
6. Sex.

Another house was rented at the corner

removal of all /partitions save one two
large rooms were neatly fitted up for the
school, and their song, "Oh, we are happy
girls who. dearly love to sew," was sung
with even greater spirit than before.
These rooms are now becoming too small

It was with some fear and trembling
that this new phnse of thÂ«* work was en

the boys won their way deep into the

results. The boys' club is now a fixture.

The boy had hia tutors, and at the
proper age began the study of military
science, for which he Is said to have
evinced considerable aptitude. As he
neared his twentieth year the watchful
ness of Metternich was redoubled and
every means employed to so engross him
with the pleaures and excitements of the
hour as to quench any upspringlng desire
to become a factor in events of the time,
lest he might finally be leJ to follow In.
the footsteps of his father and again upset
the peace of the world. He was kept sur
rounded by frivolous Intriguers, pretty
women, ballet dancers and the like to di
vert his mind from the things that con
cerned and developed men, and make him
as effeminate as posible.
Had he lived !t is questionable whether
even this policy would have been success
ful. The blood of Napoleon was In hia
veins and at times gave showing of its
color.
The revolution of 1SCO worked strongly on
the mfnd of the young Duke and brought
an agitation of spirit and a ferment of
thought which was difficult to master.
When his grandfather said to him.
"Should the French people call for you
and the allies give their consent. I should
not oppose your takinsr your place on the
Â» French throne." his ambition soared to
the highest, but only for a time.
He said to Metternich: "The great ob
ject of my life is to become worthy of
my father. I should fall In my duty to
his memory If I allowed myself to be
come a tool of factions and an Instrument
cf intriguers. The son of Napoleon must
never descend to the role of an adven
turer. But I must not forget that I am
a French Prince. I am ready when my
country ra!l3." Metternich was on his
guard. The youth's hopes soon died. Am
bition pave way to other sentiments. At
the moment when the latest confused
news of the happenings In Paris left still
doubt of the results and permitted the be
lief cf the possibility of a great struggle,
he said with iruch earnestness and vivac
ity to one of his intimates: "T wish the.
Emperor of Austria would permit me to
march with h!s troops to the succor or

way. and until relieved by death he was
a constant sufferer.
He died in the palace of Schonbrunn m
the same chamber that had been occupied
bv his father during his stay there. Some
accused the court of Austria of having
poisoned him and even designated the
physican who accomplished the deed, one
Dr. Malfatl. A French writer, however,
then residing at Vienna and familiar with
the court, says: "It is well known that
the Due de Reichstadt was afflicted with,
herpes and that the cutaneous affection
increased in violence as he grew older
until In his later years it had taken a
very permanent and positive shape In tha
form of active sores.
"It Is also well known that In 1S30 a
physician, not Malfatl. prescribed for him
cold bath?, the use of which In the course
of some weeks caused the herpes to disap
pear entirely. But from the time the dis
ease left the skin the health of the pa

to Malfatl, it was the repercussion of the
cutaneous affection on the pulmonary or
gans already weak with phthisis, which
caused his death, and this view was sus

9A little picture that surely escaped the
notice of the writer who complained of
lack of "love" in this year's landscape is
by Miss Mabel Deming of Sacramento. I
do not praise her. because she happens to
be a California girl,' but because her pic
ture really seems to me to merit the
warmest praise. That the hanging com
mittee thought likewise Is evident from
the excellent position accorded her. Her
picture is hung "on the line," which Is
considered a most enviable honor. It is
.very Â¦ unpretentious, this little landscape,

manifest even at the salon. There are no
more military pictures than usual, but
those exhibited seem to bÂ« more gener

Berne-Bellecour, has its constant crowd
of excited admirers. Perhaps there Is no
picture in the salon which is more no
ticed and more admired than "The Am

Breton exhibits another one of his poetic
peasant scenes, and Jean Paul Laurens
and Rayhet exhibit portraits which, like
that- of Benjamin-Constant, ~ possess a

be, the picture 13 nevertheless extremely
Interesting. Eve la represented ln/-a new

her head Is bowed, but a merry smile Il
luminates her visage. Metaphorically,
she ia laughing In her sleeve, while her
smile says aa distinctly as words, "You
great old goose; It's no trick at all to s'e
duce you." One cannot look at the pic
ture without feeling sory for poor,
abused Adam. He becomes almost Jus
tified in piping to the Lord. "The woman
that thou gavest me!" "The Triumph ot
Death" is also a triptych and la remark

The American Frank Boggs exhibits a

sented. The salon this year is more like
a class exposition than ever before and
consequently the honors received are not
bo Important. Being understood that It
would exist for the benefit of those ar
tists who had not yet "arrived," many of
the well-known painters did not deign to
exhibit. For this they are criticized, while
the greater simplicity of Benjamln-Con

others In this category, who have honored
ithe salcn with their best, is Justly ap
proved and commended".
Benjamln-Constar.t is represented by a
wonderful' portrait of M. Stephen Slgcard.
It Is the kind of portrait like Titian's "Man
with the Glove" and some of the old Ve
lasquezes, of which the interest will nevei
die. It cannot fall to be as fascinating, to
f jture generations as to us. Henner ap

tame characteristics that always distin

really a little fatiguing that so many ol
the artists present the same thing year In
and year out. Versatility, does not seem
to be the fashion In the art world. Hen
ner has abandoned all things else for opaÂ«
line nudes. Bouguereau is eternal', wltfe

The Figaro critic declares that Henner**

then he falls into lamentations about the
decline of the nude. "What Is going, to be

students of Paris are permitted to indulge
in the wildest debauches. Propriety is not
artistic. It does not seem to occur to the
critic, who objects to the vulgarity of some
of these pictures to advocate a greater
purity of motive and less license among
both artists and models. I cannot believe
that these extraordinary excesses, which
are not only permitted but encouraged
among the artists of Paris, are productive
cf anything in art but degeneration. The

Machines, -which had been utilized for the
purpose since 1883, was in ruins, having
been torn down to make room for an ex
position building. There was simply
nothing In Paris but "les abattoirs" that
was at all available,. and hence this ex
traordinary glorification.
For people who pretend to keep apace
with thef movements of the artistic world
1300 is certainly a formidable year. In
Paris there are three sets of comparisons
which are occupying the criticsâ what tho
year has produced as seen at the salon,
what the ten years have produced since
the last exposition, and what the century
has produced. The year as exemplified at
the salop. has given no surprise. Every;
lW. This was all very well for the great
masters who were sure of being received
at the exposition, but for young .artists
rasror to know their fate, to begin their
careers, it simply meant a year of weary
waiting. So great was the pressure that
almost at the last moment It was decided
to hold a salon, and then the Question of
where presented itself. The Galerie descine men, who are sent for when a mem
ber of the family is ill. To them sick
ness means that a devil has taken lodg
ings In the body and a devil- dancer is
weird Incantations. Suddenly the dying
man sat up in bed. The family thought
the devil dancer was exorcising the devil.
Gathering all his strength for a supreme
effort, the sick man tumbled out of bed
and tottering toward the devil dancer's
table kicked it over. For a moment, 1 star
tled beyond belief, the devil dancer con
tinued his steps and chanting, then heap
ing the vilest abuse and curses on the
man, he picked up his things and fled
from the house. Only one who knows the
superstitions of these people can appreci
ate the courage it took to desecrate a
devil dancer.
"We ourselves had thought the sick man
was beyond hope, but from that moment
he began to mend. Ills family and rela
tives, their superstitions outraged thus,
would have none of him and turned him
out of doors. We nursed him back to
health and made him one of us to help
spread the light.
"Another instance of true conversion
waa the case of a man who was the rich
est native in his village. He listened to
our teachings and became convinced, al
though^his relatives mocked him and his
new belief to scorn. His father had left
him his lands -and money on condition
that he remain a good Buddhist. Despite
this, he openly confessed Christianity,
gave up wealth and family and went to
live in a mean hut near the jungle. .
"Once we came to a large village, where
our singing and preaching attracted one
of the head men, who summoned his fel
low chiefs, and in solemn counsel they
gave us a hearing. In a calm, matter ot
fact way, they decided that the whole
village should at once become Christians.
Judge for yourself what sort of Christians
they would be.
"The natives were on the whole very
kind to us, even the native priests not
resenting our adoption of their garb and
customs. On one occasion we were forced
to travel with some native priests, who
not only shared their conveyance with
us but their food as well. We met with
the most opposition from the missionar
ies of other denominations, who objected
to our spectacular methods.
"I could not exaggerate the horrors and
â¢discomforts of those fourteen months,

LONDON, May 12.â The Boers seem

observers In England it is be
ing played not in South Africa but In the

Boer , delegates who sailed for New York

of 'â¢ British .opinion does not contemplate
for a "moment that Mr. Fischer and his
companions-will achieve success, it Is only
natural that serious thought Is . now con
fidently . devoted to prognosticating thÂ«Â»
date when the war In the Transvaal will
be ended. Most estimates concur in agree
ing Â» that ; hostilities will have ceased by
June, , when President Kruger learns j that

President Kruger must, of course, give up
all 'for which he has been fighting. But,
on the other hand: now that terms have
been so- emphatically , enunciated, they
iriust -either be, granted or England will
stand defeated. . The latter alternative,
however, does not enter England's cate
gory" of possibilities. ; Her- people are firm
ly - convinced that /Lord > Roberts will
steadily advance, -perhaps .with delays
and losses of .daredevil units, and maybe
without Inflicting a crushing defeat, until
he occupies the Transvaal. His forward
progress, they believe, will be stopped
only, when President Kruger, learning of
the failure of Fischer's mission,. asks for
peace. That this will come sooner than
previously, expected is the trend of popular
opinion to-day. ... . %
A long siege of Pretoria has become a
remote contingency. Sharp fights at
Kroonstad Â¦ and - on the Vaal 'Â¦ River, a
series : of rear guard actions with con
stantly retreating forces,, an. organized
development of a hostile country, and
then^by June ," or. perhaps' July, peace and

Usklnn Company.
IT ONDOX, May liâ Not since Lady
1 smith and Klmberly were relieved
I has London been in such a state of
j j excitement as she was last night.
Kroonstad has been taken and trtth
cut opposition. The news came almost
like a thunderclap. Some of the military
experts had been saying that Kroonstad
wouid not be taken without some stiff
fighting, but the public were very scepti
cal. Not only from a study of the map,
Â¦but also from other sources, was It known
that the numerous kopjes in the neigh
borhood of Kroonetad afforded the Boers
the best opportunity for offering strong
opposition.
On the ther hand, thes* military critics
pointed out that the country behind
Kroonstad was eo open that protracted
resistance at that point 'involved serious
risk of the Bo*r retreat being cut off
by the British cavalry, which could be
Feat around in large force. Although
few details ha\'e reached London beyond
the fact that Kroonstad was occupied
Foon after noon and the British flag
hoisted, it Is evident that the Boers were
even as long- as two days ago, when the
Free State capital was removed by proc
lamation to Helllbron. fully alive to the
danger to their supposed stronghold.
Nevertheless the British public never lm
ajr*.r:ed that the taking of Kroonstad
Â¦would prove such a pimple matter. Lord
Roberts' dispatch arrtvpd after London
had bÂ«Â»gun its night's amusement, after
the first acts In the theaters, when the
people crowded into lobbies and clubs,
where tht? people were enjoying . their
after-dinner Fmokes. As the news was
rattled out by tickers great enthusiasm
was shown. Everybody broke into cheers
for Roberts, &nd sang "God Save the
Queen" with r.o end of fervor.
In view of the easy capture of this sec
end capital of the Free State, showing
that the Boers are fully acquainted with
the odds against them in the huge Brit
ish fort p. many military men think the
first really strenuous opposition to Rob

conversation held by It over C91 miles of
telegraph wire with Governors Dan W.
Jones of Arkansas. William E. Stanley
<if Kansas and Lon V. Stevens of Mis
souri at their respective State capitals In
view of the announcement of State Secre
tary Reitz of the Transvaal that he, with
others, intends to emigrate to the United
States in the event of their defeat by the
British. Kach Governor was asked If he
would not extend an invitation to the
Boers to locate In his State.
They answered as follows:
Governor Stephens â As the chief execu
tive of the Sta.te of Missouri I desire to
hereby extend through the Sunday Post-
Dispatch a cordial and an affectionate
welcome to the Boers. Missouri would feel
honored if they would locate within" her
bounds.
Governor Jones â The State of Arkansas
will gladly welcome the Boers to become
citizens and guarantee to them freedom
and protection under a truly Republican
government.
Governor Stanley â The people of Kansas
â¢would gladly welcome the Boers. We have
r.o better citizens than the thousands of
Germans who have already prospered and
edded to the happiness oÂ£; our State. # Kan

"Nothing but absolute knowledge of the
Bufferings of the people of Mafeklng

the heart-rending accounts received from

having shared equally with ', them the

She describes the destitution of the In
habitants and the absolute ruin of air the
'small tradespeople, who$e homes, in many
cases, have been demolished. The nuns'
convent has been rrndered roofless by. the
Boer guns, yet the sisters are unremitting

sick. For months the inhabitants have
not slept In their beds. They have given
lives and property and stood by. the Â¦ gal

The British forces have' arrived here,

In the direction of. his force. Some'of the

LONDON, May. 13, 4 a. m.â The
situation at the seat of war In
South Africa Is as satisfactory
from the British ' viewpoint . as
the most sanguine friend could have
hoped a week ago. ..The occupation
of Kronstad practically places the
whole Orange Free State In Brit
ish possession.
Â¦ : It' is: evident' from 'Lord' Roberts'

tlon has commenced. The Free
Staters are scattering to their
homes, while the Transvaalers have
gone northward, declining to fight
longer in the Orange Free State. .
What . little resistance the former
still are likely to make seems to be
centering at Llndley. whither Presi
dent Steyn has transferred his Gov-^
ernnient. It Is â¢ evident Â¦ that the
strategy of Lord Roberts and the
rapidity of his ' advance have be
wildered and disheartened the
BoeTS.' as their, resistance since the
British reached Zand , River haa
been slight. The only, point where
they seriously attempted to check

erally. It Is useless to attempt to disguise
the fact that the Government's supporters
are looking forward to Sunday's result
with grave concern. The organs of the
Radicals predict that a Nationalist victory
will make a municipal policy that will
make Paris uninhabitable for foreigners
who come to spend their money here. Thta
remark is based on the Nationalists' tac
tics since last year, which appear to have
been to endeavor to embroil France in
foreign . complications In order to shake
the Government position thereby.
Pursuant to these tactics, the National
organs continually publish statements In-
tended to excite a feeling against foreign
ers. The Nationalists credit the Govern
ment with the Machiavellian scheme. \n
the event of a sweeping victory to-mor
row, of instigating the Ministerial minor
ity In the Council Into creating a series of
violent obstructive scenes, which would
give the Government a pretext for dissolv
ing the Council on the ground of divided
factions whose opposition would prevent
the carrying on of municipal works. Tho
Municipal Commission 'would then be ap
pointed to take charge of affairs until
the election of a new Coundl, which
would be postponed as long as possible In
order to give the Government time for
electioneering. Such a plan, which would
be tantamount to a veritable coup <iÂ»

especially now that the- alleged Intention
has been divulged. .

BERLIN, May 12.â This week's proceed
ings in the 'Reichstag: were j rather tame.
but the: passage of the" African steamer
bill is of interest to Americans, inasmuch
as the Government declared Its willing
ness to insert into the contracts. with this
subventioned line the same paragraph
that is already In the North German
Lloyd's contract, forbidding their steam
ers landing agricultural products compet
ing with German products at German
ports: The fact ; that a proviso exists <ln
the Lloyd contracts for German mails
was brought out clearly because the
Agrarian leader, Oertel, without contra
diction, thanked the imperial Chancellor,
Count von Hohenlohe, for the proviso.
However, practically the effect- of the pro
viso is likely to be nil, because the agri
cultural products icannot bear the high
freight charges of fast steamers.
The Centrist party of - the Reichstag
will make another effort to pass the so
called lex heinze, which places a number
of onerous restraints upon' literature and
art, Â¦ despite the 1 known disapproval of the
bill .^by. -the 'Eemperor. 'The * Centrists,
with I the Conservatives, v intend that, the
bill shall be put on its final passage before

and if the bill is passed' the Bundcsrath

The Cured Fruit Association is endeav-""
oring to get control of SO per cent. The
officers believe that if this percentage Ii
obtained the whole surplus can be mar
keted at not less than 3 cents. It Is
thought that the surplus can be placed
In foreign markets at a small differential,
much less than if the surplus Is to be
worked off in the home market. If the
surplus is retained at home it must be
disposed of as a by-product and this is
a constant menace to the price.
Only one week more and the tale will
be told. At that time the association
fails or wins, depending on the acreage
yielded. At the headquarters of the asso
ciation to-day It was stated that- some

PARIS. May 12.- The American Pavilion
et the exposition was formally turned over
to the authorities and the public this aft
ernoon." The inauguration took place in
the presence of embassy and consulate
officials, a number of high French func
tionaries, foreign diplomats and cornmis-
Fioners and such a concourse of American
citizens that many who were provided
with tickets were unable to gain admis
eion to the building. French municipal
guards and policemen formed a cordon
around the building, keeping the space in
front of the main entrance on the em
bankment of the Seine free for the pas
sage of the official party. The crowd as
sembled mainly on the terrace around the
building facing the river, on which a
s-pecial platform had been erected for
Sousa's band. Before the hour set for the
ceremony the crowd became so dense that,
orders were given to* the police to keep
the people at a respectful distance from
the doors. The French officers adhered
so etrictly to the letter of their instruc
tions that even persons holding invita
tions were not allowed to pass. Consid
erable confusion resulted from this cause,
?.nd the United States Kmbassador, Gen
eral Horace Porter, with his party, found
their passage barred until an official, per
ceiving him from the building, hastened
to meet him and the Embassador's party
scrambled through. The arrangements
tor handling the crowd were very unsat
isfactory and many gave up the effort to
t-n ter.
The Interior of the pavilion was bright
ly decorated with American flags and tri
rolored bunting, while from the summit
of the dome, around the golden eagle,
flew the stars and stripes and the French
flag. The balconies were occupied exclu
sively by invited guests, while on the
floor of the building a double line of
American guards with white summer hel
mets formed an aisle through which the
official party passed from the main en
trance to the where the presentation
took place. Behind these guards Ameri
cans who gained admission stood and wit
nessed the proceedings.
Ceremony Without Pomp.
ThÂ«> ceremony of transferring the pavil
ion was quite simple, consisting of an ad
dress by Ferdinand W. Peck, Commis
sioner of the United States, handing over
the pavilion to M. Alfred Picard, as the
commissioner general or the exposition,
and the latter's response in accepting the
transfer. Sousa'e band provided music
and the selections played were compos*Kl
felfly of American airs, except for the
"Marseillaise." *
Mr. Peck had arrived at the pavilion
about 2 o'clock to await the arrival of M.
Picard, who. escorted r>y B. D. "Wood
ward, assistant United States Commis
sioner, entered the exposition gate at the
Invalides bridge at 2:30 o'clock and pro
ceeded immediately along the Quai de Or
say to the entrance of the American
l>uilding. which faces the Seine.
Afier a brief glance at the equestrian
etatue of Washington, which guards the
portals of the American national pavil
ion, M. Picard ascended the steps leading
to the door. Here Mr. Peck stood. Fur
rounded by the members of the United
States commission, and as he welcomed
the French commissioner-general Sousa's
hand struck up the "Marseillaise." All the
spectators at once uncovered, and amid
the strains of the Prench hymn M. Picard

This is a demonstrated fact and can
be proven by any one who cares '.to
make the test. When one nourishes and
builds up the brain and nerve centers
that is practically the keynote to the
whole health proposition, for when the
r.ervous system is in perfect poise all
parts of the body respond.
Grap^-Kuts are for sale at all the large
grocery stores in the country and can be
found in use in practically all of the best
families in America. * *
"Up to now I have consumed about
150 packages and have gained ?o
pounds in flesh. Am a marvel to all my
friends who are aware of my former
state of health. There are about fifty
families who have adopted the use of
Grape- Nuts because of my experience.
You can pive my name and home ad-
dress, but do not^ mention my profes-

There is a reason. The makers of
Grape-Nuts select certain parts of the
grains of the field that contain delicate
particles of phosphate of potash and. al-
bumen. These elements, when com-
bined in the human body, go directly to
rebuild the gray matter in the brain and
nerve centers of the body.
*.'I have no objection to the public
knowing of the wonderful transforma-
tion my system has undergone by the
use of Grape-Nuts since November,
1809. I began using the food when con-
valescing and when in an exceedingly
low condition, and used a small quantity
and became so fascinated with the flavor
that I gradually discontinued nearly all
other food, including tea and coffee.

SAYS SOUTHERN PACIFIC
WILL RESTORE OLD RATE
Commissioner Blackstock Does Not
Believe the Company Will Even
Appeal to the Courts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. May 12.â Railroad
Commissioner Blackstock of Ventura,
who was in Los Angeles to-day, is of the
opinion . that the Southern Pacific will
without resorting to legal process, restore
the old rates that have existed between
Fresno and San Francisco. When seen
to-night Blackstock said that he had just
come down from San Francisco and that
before he left he was Informed that the
company Intended to restore rates
throughout the San Joaquin Valley. This
rate will extend to Los Angeles. He con
tinued:
"The board will meet again Monday,
and should the Southern Pacific, In face
of the second complaint that has been
filed, show any inclination to protest the
Attorney General will be requested to
place the matter before the Superior
Court of San Francisco. The result will
be that an order will be made that the
company be forced to abrogate the entire
rate schedule now in effect. It is my
opinion that the company will not appeal
from the recent decision the board made."
Blackstock to-night left for Milwaukee
to attend the annual convention of Rail
road Commissioners of the United States,
which meets May 2S. He says that In all
probability the next annual convention of
the commissioners will be held in Sau
Francisco. .
that I may add my words that the suffer
ing shall no longer be permitted to con
tinue.
"This work of relief was practically be
gun in Manila in August, 1SOT, In my home
where General Lawton and I resided. The
wives of the officers stationed in that city
were called to a meeting and the Hospital
Aid Society was organized. Of this soci
ety Mrs. General K. H. Liscum was made
president and it is to-day in existence.
Mrs. Denby, the wife of the Peace Com
missioner, also Joined the society. The
Aid Society was formed on lines that
would bring comforts to the men and it
did not deal with the question of medi
cine. This was entirely left to the super
vision of the competent medical corps."
Aid Society Formed.
The formation of this Hospital Aid So
ciety. Mrs. Lawton in her narration says,
was the outgrowth of visits that had been
made to the hospital wards. The ladies
who minister to the suffering observed
that recoveries were slow; that the men
seemed depressed and that they grew list
less and Indifferent.
"A careful study of this feature con
vinced us that homesickness was the basis
for this condition," Mrs. Lawton con
tinued. "My attention was drawn to this
when a big brawney fellow from Oregon
shot through the right chest, said:
" 'Mrs. Lawton, you do not know how
nice it is to have some one come to see
you when you are 3ick. You don't know
what these visits mean to men who are
far from home, I am homesick for my
home and* my country and these pale
faces fill me with despair. 1
"That solved the mystery," Mrs. Law
ton, with emphasis, said. "Heart sick
ness, caused them more mental anxiety
tnan did the pain that their wounds
gave. The human heart Is the same the
world over, and when it feels neglected
the suffering, whether real or imagined,
ls^ increased. This grows more acute
when the sufferer is surrounded by
stumps of arms and legless frames or
other evidences of the ravages of Mauser
bullets.
"Can any American woman imagine
what sickroom comforts would mean to
scores of men that" till rows upon rows
of single cots, whose minds are centered
upon their own wounds, and particularly
when every face they see is drawn or
pinched, and every man must be helped
for the least want owing to the lack of
a member that once was his pride and
resource?" is an appeal that Mrs. Lawton
enunciated when she essayed to describe
the interior of a hospital ward
"When we formed our Hospital Aid So
ciety we enlisted the good offices of the
officers in command," Mrs. Lawton eald
in explaining the hospital relief work
"and the boxes and crates of books and
other matter were sent to my home the
use of one room having bee'n donated.
Here we unpacked and resorted into con
venient bundles what was in stock. These
packages were sent to posts everywhere'
and from there into distant camps and
into the trenches in the interior For
hospitals we retained what was cheering
and light in characterâ all that would
amuse and give comfort. The effect waÂ»
electric. We formed ourselves into visit
ing committees; we rotated the reading
matter; cheering words were whispered
and with note books and pencils we
Jotted down what the ailing soldier might
need to give him comfort. These atten
tions were better than tonics, as the
physical condition was soon improved
We drew upon the slender stock of deli
cacies, and with a degree of enthusiasm
that I can faintly express they were wel
comed.
Having but recently returned from Ma
nila, Mrs. Lawton in competent to judge
as to what the needs of the sick and
maimed soldier might be. In words of no
uncertain meaning Mrs. Lawton declares
that- in Manila and other points where
hospitals are located there is more to do
than the women of America conceive.
Medicine Not Needed.

tion Mrs. Lawton also was equally as
explicit, having been in the Cuban cam
paign, and having gone with General
Lawton 'to Manila, and having heard the
roar of artillery Mrs. Lawton can speak
with the sincerity that bears the stamp
of experience dearly purchased. "As the
general government supplies all the
stores, medical and otherwise, that are
needed for the direct care of the army
the women of America must Â¦ turn their
attention to the preparation and the
supplying of those comforts that are
needed for the sick, the wounded and the
convalescent, that that look of distress
may leave their faces."
From actual experience in the hospitals,
having almost stepped from the wards
to the steamer upon her return to her
native land, Mrs. Lawton believes thai
she Is competent to speak upon what
will prove most beneficial to the suffering
soldiers and what would best serve to en
hance their comforts. In speaking upon
this phase: of the matter she said:
Regarding the methods of contribution
and distribution Mrs.' Lawton places the
matter, on a purely business basis. "No
matter what Is undertaken, an executive
head must have charge of the details and
a work of this character, is no exception.
In order to facilitate the forwarding of
contributions . my .personal suggestion
would be that a central depot be. estab
lished - In San Francisco and â¢ from - that
point all the shipments for the relief of
the sick be made. I suggest San. Francisco
because It is the nearest and most con
venient shippin* point to the Orient. It
is the metropolis of the Western section
and drains all territory to the East.
Steamers leave on regular dates . for the
Far East and during the interims trans
ports sail. Thus quick communication is
had and the time in transit is reduced
from thirty-one to twenty-five days.
From my recent association with the pa
triotic women of San Francisco and from
what I know of their magnanimous con
duct during the height of the late war I
am led to think that if a call weremade
for them to create a- forwarding and-re
ceiving headquarters they would willingly
respond. Their city has become historic
as a military barracks, for the speeding
and welcoming American soldiers and the
magnificence of their receptions to the re
turning troops, nnd a call to aid the sick
or the distressed and the wounded will
not go unheeded.
Papers Acceptable.
"In regard to reading matter I wish to
say," Mrs. Lawton continued, "that too
much of it cannot be sent. There is one
class of newspapers that Is particularly
welcomed. I refer to copies of thousand's
of weekly papers that are published
These contain the home news, the com
ings, the goings and the doings of people
that never elsewhere are published. This
suggestion springs from an incident that
came under my notice. When we were un
packing the boxes in my Manila home a
paper from Worcester. Mass., and one
from Fredonia, Kans., came to my- hands.
I remembered that in the hospital were
two boys that hailed from those states. To
each man was given his State paper. The
Massachusetts boy had been raised in
Worcester. The delight in being brought
nearer his old home and in reading about
the people he knew I cannot describe. The
Kansas boy put his face in his -pillow. I
shook their trembling hands, for not a
word was said. No medicine that could
have been administered would so quickly
have removed the sufferings from home
sickness that they endured. Such slight
things as these show the absolute need
for a class of attention. The best- nurses
cannot give if they lack the materials."
Mrs. Lawton has given the names of the
following ladies in Manila who will see
that every package sent will. have proper
care and that they will be forwarded or
that the contents will be used in lifting
the sorrows under which the American
soldier droops and pines: Mrs. E. H. Lts
cum, president of- the Hospital Aid So

Liflcum, in command of tha Ninth Infan

Oakland Office San Francisco Cali.
111S Broadway. May 12.
The battle which Is on between the Mer
chants' Exchange of' Oakland and the
business men of Alameda over the tax
ing of delivery wagons has resulted In a
claimed victory for both sides so far as
the opening contest went to-day In Judge
Ellsworth's court. In the test case on ha
beas corpus, wherein F. J. Joseph, a
driver for the Oakland Fruit and Pro
duce Company, had been arrested in Ala
meda, Judge Ellsworth intimated that the
Alameda license order was illegal, but he
remanded Joseph for trial. This will give
the Alameda side a chance to get second
wind and try to find law to overcome the
objections to the ordinance which were
raised during to-day's argument.
The point of difference between the
clashing mercantile communities is over
an ordinance in force In Alameda which
compels the payment of a license tax
upon vehicles doing a delivery business
there. This meant that merchants in Oak
land who sent their delivery wagons into
Alameda with goods would have to meet
the tax or suffer arrest. The argument
to-day on behalf of Oakland was that
Alameda's City Trustees had gone be
yond their powers in passing such a law.
It was claimed that these delivery wag
ons were not used for hire; that they
were not engaged in the exclusive busi
ness of expressage and therefore could
not be taxed, being simply a part of the
general paraphernalia of the firm engaged
in selling roods.
Judge Ellsworth said that while the or
dinance appeared to impose a tax upon
the business of delivering goods he was
In much doubt whether a license could
bÂ« imposed upon merchants who used
their own vehicles simply to deliver their
The writ was dismissed because there
was no evidence before the court whether
Josephs was an expressman or a mer
chant's delivery driver. This would of
necessity have to be proved before the
case could finally be decided.

SAN RAFAEL, May 12.â Residents of
this city were startled this morning by a
man In a trance who got full and ran
amuck. A quack hypnotist, who rejoices
in the name of Casteel. had thrown the
man in his alleged trance last night, and
in this condition he was placed in the
show window of a vacant store on B
street. At 10 o'clock to-night he was to
have been called bacK to things mundane
by the professor of mesmer.
But somehow In the stilly night spirits
of another kind than those who watch the
hypnotized soul reached the subject and
he must have got on quite a respectable
"Jag," for this morning when the pro
fessor, followed by a crowd, went to visit
his victim, the man was rolling about In
the narrow confines of/the show window
in a very untrancelike manner. He was
extricated and removed, and "Casteel"
left town in a hurry, not waiting to re

KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 12.â The Fed
eral authorities found alleged cause for
interfering this evening in the streetcar
strike inaugurated this morning by the
union employes of the Metropolitan Street
Railway Company. Judge William C.
Hook of Leavenworth, Kans., sitting in
Kansas City, issued from the United
States District Court tornight an injunc
tion that is more absolute and sweeping
in Its terms than any injunction ever be
fore secured in this district in a conten
tion between labor and capital.
The injunction is made absolute for a
week, the matter being set for a hearing
on Saturday next, and if its restrictions
shall be observed by the strikers the Met
ropolitan Company has its light won, for
the strikers' hands are tied for seven
days end in the meantime the Metropol
itan Company can go about the reorgan
ization of its disrupted forces.
â¢ The injunction ip predicated upon the
fact that several of the persons com
plained against as threatening the inter
ests of the company are residents of other
States and the further fact that the
strikers threaten to prevent the company
from carrying out its contract with the
United States Government to transport
the city mail carriers to and from their
routes.
Harry Bryan, the national organizer of
the Amalgamated Association, described
as a resident of Michigan, is one of the
parties enjoined and the others named
are twenty-three local leaders of the
union, several of whom are mentioned as
residents of Ohio and Kansas.
The- injunction restrains the persons
named and all others from in any manner
directly or indirectly stopping or interfer
ing with the running of cars on the lines
of the Metropolitan Company; enjoins
them from harassing, assaulting or in any
manner interfering with any person who
may be in the employ of the company as
he goes to or from his work or as he is
engaged in the operation of a streetcar;
enjoins union men and all others from
picketing or patroling the carhouses, stop
ping places, stations, tracks or approaches
theieto, or loitering in large numbers in
or about any of the places named, or
making loud or boisterous noises in the
vicinity thereof for the purpose of inter
fering with or intimidating the company's
employes.
The injunction even goes further than
this and enjoins any concerted action to
cause any act or annoyance which will
assist in stopping the operation of the cars
or interfering in any way with an em
ploye in moving a car which may carry a
mail carrier or a messenger, or upon
which a mail carrier or a messenger may
wish to ride.
The restrictions not only apply to Or
ganizer Harry Bryan and the twenty-two
men named but to all others who may be
acting in concert with them after the en
tering of this injunction.
In addition to the police and the deputy
county marshals sworn in to-day a forcb
of United States marshals will be on hand
to interfere in case the injunction is ig
nored and there is every probability that
the strikers will not desist in their efforts
to bring out the men who have so *far
failed to join them.
Up to a late hour to-night there had
been no disturbance at any point and tin,
company was maintaining a fairly efficient
service. *

ADv.E^ttTIHKM KJJTS.ST. LOUIS, Mo.; May 12.â An earnest ef
fort was made to-day to settle the strike
by means of arbitration along the lines
suggested by "\V. H. Woodward and other
employes of union labor. These efforts
came to nothing, however, as the strikers
and street car companies could not be
brought together on any proposition in
volving the recognition of the union in the
manner desired. The effort at a compro
mise began with the WalthallHall meeting
this morning at which the citizens' com
mittee waited upon President Whlttaker
and Attorney Lehmann of the Transit
Company. Propositions which the com
pany was willing to accept were found to
be unsatisfactory to the union and vice
versa, so that after trips back and forth
the committee of union labor employes
found its mission far from accomplished.
Still hopeful that a settlement might be
reached, the committee tried to arrange
another conference for to-night, but Mr.
Whittaker announced that he was on the
point of leaving the city to be absent
until Monday morning, and the confer
ence was declared oft! until that time. The
grievance committee of the strikers and
Mr. Woodward's committee will meet at
the Mercantile Club at 9 a. m. Monday.
With the assistance of the police the
Transit Company succeeded in getting
three more of its lines open to-day, al
.though one was put temporarily out of
commission by cut wires and barricades.
The new lines opened weVe the Page and
Spaldlng lines of the Lindell division and
the Laclede-avenue line. In addition, the
Delmar, Park avenue, Compton and Cali
fornia avenue lines were operated more
or less regularly. No cars were run on
any of them, however, after 7 p. m.
The Suburban system as usual managed
to run pretty nearly on schedule time on
each of its three divisions. At dusk, how
ever, there was a complete suspension of
operations. .
A few cases of violence were reported
from various part3 of the city and some
shooting was done, but without ser ous
results. A number of arrests on. minor
charges growing out of the present diffi
culties were reported. _ - _ â¢"â¢
No street cars will be run in St. Louis
to-morrow. Chief of Police Campbell
considered it necessary that his men
should have some rest and refused to de
tail them to keep the street car line open
to-morrow. Finding that the Chief could
not be moved from his purpose, the street
railway people decided to make no at
tempt to keep the lines open.
No Attempt Will Be Made
to Keep Lines Open on
the Sabbath.

Colonel John P. Irish addressed the
Monticello Club last evening on the sub

much prejudice in politics and much had
been displayed in the consideration of the
question of trusts. That question would
not be settled permanently on the basis of
prejudice, but only upon that of reason.
Trusts are convenient tools with which
to do a certain thing. Workingmen had
objected to labor-aiding, machinery. The
trust was in business what labor-aiding
machinery was In its field of operation.
The trusts had aroused antagonism on the
part of those whose labor had been obso
leted. Men Â¦would not as readily content
themselves with the trusts as they had'
with the labor-aiding machinery. A trust
was an incorporation of corporations. It
had the element of legal immortality.
What the American Federation of Trades
was to the labor organizations that was
the trust, comparatively speaking, to the
corporations. The Federation of Trades
tried to make skilled labor scarce by plac
ing restrictions upon -the employment of
apprentices, the purpose being to raise
the price oi labor. The trust limited pro
duction to enhance prices. Colonel Irish
said that he did not know how to do
away with the trusts. One drastic method
would be to take from the statute books
all measures that gave them superiority
to the individual. All political parties
would denounce trusts this year and
would try to outdo one another to get
votes. It would be some years before any
solution would be reached. Only those
trusts that were economical, that they
might be able to reduce prices, survive
long. Those that raised the prices of ne
cessities found competition to destroy
them. Party politics could never remedy
the matter.
Questions Arising Must Be
Settled Upon Basis of
COLONEL IRISH
DISCUSSES THE
MODERN TRUSTS
The struggle during the second half was
sharper than in the first and both teams
were determined to score. Any number
of times the ball missed going into the
basket of either side, just getting exas
peratlngly close and then bounding away.
At last, ten minutes before the call of
time, San Francisco committed a foul,
entitling Alameda to a free throw from
the flve-yard line. There was a hush of
expectancy when Miss Clara Houston pre
pared to make.the toss and a point had
already been counted by the enthusiasts
of Alameda. But the young lady missed
and hopes were crushed. Shortly after
play had been resumed there was another
foul by the visitors. This time Misa Eva
Roesch threw the ball, which descended
gracefully into its nest and ended the
game â score 1 to 0.
The team of the Girls' High School was
made up as follows: Miss Edith Driscoll,
captain and center; Miss Emma Hahn,
right center; Mlsa Eleanor Talcott, left
center; Miss Florence Martin, Miss Jose
phine Seavy and Miss Alice Gorham,
goals; Miss Susie Daniels, Miss Lucy Agar
and Miss Anna Kenna, guards. They were
attired in bloomers of navy blue and wore
white sweaters.
Alameda played the following: Miss
"Vlda McKean, captain and center; Mis*
Ray Jacobs, left center; Miss Kathleen
Lenlhan. right center; Miss Irma Seider.'
Miss Clara Houston and Miss Eva
Roesch, goals; Mlsa Orie Healey. Mls9
Daisy Aear and Miss Ruth Hebard.
guards. They wore bloomer costumes of
dark green.
During the Intermission between the two
halves Mrs. Kloch of San Francisco ren
dered a vocal solo. "May Morning." from
the veranda of the Mastick home. Ml*Â»r
MarlÂ© Victors was the accompanist.
The game was played for the benefit of
Play commenced at 3 o'clock. In the
first half the ball surged between the two
goal posts for twenty minutes and when
time was called for ten minutes' rest
neither team had scored a mark. Por a
few moments the players would struggle
in a mass around the Alameda goal until
it seemed certain the ball in its flight
would drop into the basket. Then in an
incredibly short time the sphere would be
at the other end of the field dancing
merrily about the San Francisco goal and
sustaining abuse Â«from the eighteen pairs
of hands fighting for its possession.
A larpe crowd turned out to witness the
game and to cheer their favorites. San
Francisco brought a delegation with it,
but Alameda outnumbered the visitors
five to one. â ' Â¦
ALASIEDA, May 12.â So evenly matched
were the teams representing: the San
Francisco Girls* High School and the Ala
meda High School in the basket-ball game
at the. home of Mrs. George H. Mastick
this afternoon that the home team suc
ceeded In scorinf but one solitary point.
That one point, however, was somewhat
in the nature of a fluke as it was scored
through the commission of a foul on the
part of the
Lively Game of Basket Ball
Played for Benefit
of Charity.

House Committee Practically Com
pletes the Bill Carrying an
Appropriation.
WASHINGTON. May 12.â The House
Committee on the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition at St. Louis In 1903 at a meet
ing to-day practically completed the bill
providing for Government participation,
although several matters of detail are
yet to be passed upon. The appropriation
section was considered at length and the
view prevailed that as the Government
was to contribute one-third of the cost
of the enterprise the bill should provide
that the Government would share pro
portionately with St. Louis and the sub
scribers In the net proceeds of the enter
prise The section was referred to a sub
committee to redraft it with this end in
view With this change it is probable
that "the committee will favor the Gov
ernment appropriation. The various de
partments are called upon to suggest any
changes desired in the provisions for their
several exhibits. The committee will
meet on the 22d Inst. to finally pass upon
the subject. "
GOVERNMENT AID FOR
ST. LOUIS EXPOSITION
Administration Determined to Bring
to Justice Every Guilty
Person.
WASHINGTON, May 12.-Assistant Sec
retary Meiklejohn has apparently been
charged with the direction of the prosecu
tion of the inquiry into the alleged Cuban
postal frauds. Probably this is by virtue
of the fact that he has been in charge of
all matters in the War Department per
taining to the insular possessions of the
United States, and consequently has,
through a specially erected bureau In his
office, kept account of all the receipts and
expenditures of the Islands, including
Cuba. At noon to-day the Assistant Sec
retary retired in Secretary Root's private
office for a secret conference with Deputy
Auditor Lawshe and the postofflce in
spectors who have been detailed by Post
master General Smith to investigate these
Cuban postal frauds. Beyond the fact
that the participants are carefully exam
ining the data brought from Havana by
Colonel Burton nothing could be gleaned
as to the nature or the proceedings.
Acting Secretary Meiklejohn received
an express package to-day from General
Wood at Havana, containing an applica
tion for the extradition of Neeley. â¢ Mr.
Meiklejohn sent the document to the De
partment cf Justice for the action of the
Attorney General, who undoubtedly will
cause its presentation to the Governor of
New York without delay.
At the conclusion of the conference at
the War Department this afternoon it
was announced that Assistant Secretary
Meiklejohn had appointed Abram L. Law
she, deputy Auditor for the Postofflce De
partment, to be assistant Auditor for
auditing the accounts of the departmental
postofliees in Cuba, in place of W. H.
Reeves, who has been suspended pending
the result of the investigation of the al
leged frauds.
Mr. Lawshe, accompanied by Mr. Net
tleton, an expert accountant, will leave
on Monday for Havana to make a thor
ough investigation of the Cuban postal
service. It is declared to be the purpose of
the administration to bring to Justice
every person who may be found to have
been connected in any manner with
frauds upon the postal revenues.
INVESTIGATING CUBAN
POSTOFFICE FRAUDS
"It is evident," said Hale, "that we
cannot dispose of this question to-day.
We are at the mercy of the minority."
On his motion the Senate then at 4:13
p. m. adjourned.
Tillman's amendment striking out the
committee's proposition to pay $445 per
ton for armor, fixing the maximum price
at $3'XÂ» per ton.Â»except for armor for the
battleships Maine. Missouri and Ohio, for
which {545 was to be paid, and making it
mandatory upon the Secretary of the
Navy to construct an armor plant, was
defeated, 22 to 24, the vote in no respect
differing from the vote on Pettus' amend
ment.
Tillman then offered his amendment
three times, each time raising slightly the
limit of cost of the armor. Each time the
amendment was defeated. An effort was
made by those opposed to the committee
to prevent its proposition from coming to
a vote. Hale made an appeal to the Sen
ate that it should stand by the unanimous
agreement to vote finally upon the armor
piate question at to-day's session.
Chandler offered an amendment pre
cisely similar to those proposed by Till
man. The vote on the amendment indi
cated the absence of a quorum, the vote
bt-inu 17 ayes to 23 noes. A call of the
Senate was demanded and a quorum was
developed. A vote on Chandler's amend
ment was taken again, resulting ayes 17,
noes 22â not a quorum.
The amendment offered by Penrose to pay
$545 per ton for the armor of the Maine,
Ohio and Missouri was defeated. Pettus
of Alabama offered an amendment mak
ing it mandatory upon the Secretary of
the Navy to erect an armor plate plant
at once at a cost not to exceed $4,010,000.
The amendment *was defeated, 22 to 24,
as follows:
Ayesâ Bacon, Bate. Berry, Carter, Chandler,
Cockrell. Daniel. Davi6, Harris, Jones of Ar
kansas, Jones of Nevada, Mallory. Money, Mor
gan. Nelson. Pettus, Spooner, Stewart, Teller,
Thurston. Tillman. Vest â 22.
No*eâ Allison, Baker, C'ark of Wyoming, De
pew, Elkins, Fairbanks, Foraker, Foster, Frye,
Hale, Hansbrough, Hawley, Hoar, Lodge, Mc-
Bride. McComas, McCumber, McEnery, Pen
roee. Perkins, Proctor, Quarles, Ross, Shoupâ
Beaten by a Close Vote.
speech of the Senator from Massachusetts yes
terday an an argument in favor of the speedy
completion of the ships or of increasing our
ravy, that it might be necessary that we
should be ready to meet the challenge of that
doctrine by Germany. I do not believe it. 1
have on authority warrant for asserting that
there has not been a time when there existed
a more cordial relation betwen the United
States and <J*rmany than exists to-day.
I lock for no war. no trouble with the Em
pire of Germany. 1 think there Is no founda
tion lor any such suggestion. But we must
have a large, navy. I do not say that we have
become a tirst-class nation in the sense that
we have not been one, but we are a develop
ing- and an aggressive nation. Our commerce
is constantly expanding and will be content
with no limit or boundary- We must have a
largtr navy. We will have commercial inter
ests in every country and we must be ready
as we will be willing to safeguard our Inter
ests in all parts of the world.
In conclusion Spooner argued that inas
much as "the country is defenseless and
at the mercy of two armor companies"
the United States ought to erect its own
armor plant without delay. The present
situation, he declared", was intolerable.
In closing the debate Hale, in charge of
the bill, said:
I don't believe that a great need ox neces
sity for an increase of the navy stalks betore
us because of any apprehension of hostilities,
either now or in the future, with the Empire
of Germany. That great country is tied to us
by indissoluble bonds in the name of 10,000,000
people oi German extraction, who to-day make
some of our best citizens.
1 have no fear that any danger awaits us
from German intervention. But we do need
a respectable navy of the best ships in the
world. And with the vale of waters between
us and Europe nobody need fear that any
uaticn is likely to trouble us.
I am In favor of an Increase in our navy. I
have no defcire to rlva> England in the magni
tude of its navy. I am not ambitious that the
Inited States should enter into competition
with any European power. I'll not vote to
Cf^ed these ships to completion, as was sug
gested by the Fenator from Sla*fachu?ettÂ«
(Lodge) yesterday in order to defend the Mon
roe doctrine. ThÂ« Senator almost said we were
in danger from Oermany on account of that
doctrine. The doctrine i* dearly cherUhed by
the American people. It u regarded as a vital
principle and it will r.ever be surrendered at
the challenge cf any Government, even thoueh
we have to empty the almost unlimited re-'
sources of the country <n it* defense I be
lieve that tbere ha* not b*en a time tn fifty
years when there was lets danger than there
is to-day of the challenge of toe Monroe doc
trine by any government under the rky. I was
â¢â¢jrprised at the suggestion contained in the
s-pooner of Wisconsin did not approve of
nrr.itinj? the price of armor to $3iÂ«0 per ton
and said he regarded it as very humiliat
ing to the United States that our ships
should stand in the stocks awaiting their
armor. Saiu he:
Rawlins of Utah, speaking- In support of
a Government armor factory, made an at
tack upon the administration's foreign
policy. He spoke of the United States as
trying to plav the "bully of the Darda
nelles, thus bidding deiiance to the rest of
mankind."
1 with to enter ir.y jmaeet as emphatically as
I cÂ»n ttiat the United States has sot to be a
firet-class "world power.** 1 am tick Â»jf hear
ing Senators say that, tir.ee this uretched im
perialis-tic bufinet*, we have become a Sm
ciats power. The United Stales came out cf the
war of 1S12 a first-class power, and she has betn
a l\rst-c!aFs power ever Fine* â a power that hae
k*pt off the whole of Eurej* from North Amer
ica and the West Indian inlands except as it
Â»af tiiere before. The Unit* 1 .! States is not as
strong us it was a year ago because it h^s
br.und :m-if ever since that time to keep the
face in distant j'OEÂ«-ssi-jns. The little country
lh:it did t!iat thins rthe remarkable achieve

vmtured to tackle us, ani thtre is not a coun
try on earth, treat or small, that would not
have got out of any trouble with us by diplo
macy ratb.tr than ly war.
Stewart of Nevada urged the construc
tion of a Government armor plant, not
only to prevent the armor manufacturers
"milling ' the Government, but to enable
us to do our own work if it should become
necessary in taking and maintaining our
place as a world power.
?â¢Â¦Wretched Imperialistic Business."
Hoar of Massachusetts made a sharp re
ply to a statement by Stewart. Said he:
1 tÂ»*'.ieve I am prepared to shew that the Har
vey ;>a:er.t *Â»Â«â¢Â« a fraud ar.d that it was im
pofcÂ«i upon the Patnet Ofttcfc and xivon the
Govtrsmer.1 by eubterfuce. if not by dishon
esty. When the Government refused to pay
mire thuiu $JjO a ton for Harvey armor the
corr.bir.ed arnicr manufacturers of the world
endeavored to oMain by eubterfuce cr by in
juti'.i.e ancther armor. I <lo not believe that
the Kru:':> arraor which they offer us has any
raer.t wh.ut-ver exc*iit that it is hardened
dewier thin the Harveyised armor by the well
known rataE6 of hardening eteel by carboniza
tion. There is no patent about it, and there
is no secret about it that is worth a dollar in
a:ij court.
Chandler concluded with the statement
that the proposed Government armor
plant could be erected for Sl.&OO.OuO and a
steel plant alongside of it for fcWO.000. and
he believed the plants ought to be con
structed. He thought that Admiral O'Nell,
chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, could
build such plants and build them well.
Ctandler's Sensational Charges.
When consideration was returned of the
armor p'ate section of the naval appro
priation bill. Chandler, speaking oi the
Navy Departments advocacy of contract
ing with armor-plate manufacturers, said
that Commaudor Folgcr, after the adop
tion of the Harveyized armor by this
Government, resigned and joined the Har
vev Company at a salary of SSOM, with an
addition of $20,000 of stock In the com
pany. He thtn went to Europe in the in
terests Oi the company. At the conclu
sion cf Secretary Tracy's term he became
Immediately counsel for the Harvey Com
pany in defense of the Harvey patents.
Coniinuing, Chandler declared:
Neither the Senator from Wisconsin
nor the Senator from Maine was fear
ful that we might become involved in
difficulties with Germany on account of
the Monroe doctrine. Hoar of Massachu
setts protested against the "wretched im
perialistic business," and the talk that
this nation had only recently become a
"world power," asserting that it had been
a world power since the war of 1S12.
DurirR the debate Chandler of New
Hampshire delivered a sensational speech.
In which he charged that the Government
had been defrauded in the adoption of the
Harveyized 'armor. He declared a similar
fraud was proposed in the attempt to
force the Government to adopt the Krupp
8Xir.or. Spooncr of Wisconsin and Hale of
Maine made notable speeches, deprecating
the war talk yesterday by Lodge of Mass
achusetts.
V. ASI1IXGTON-. May 12.-By a close
\ o 1 1 the Senate to-day rejected the prop
os'tion to erect without reference to the
prteQ at which the Government could pro
cure armor plate for Sts warships an
Â¦ rmor-plate factory. The vote upon the
â¢ !rect proposition was 22 to 21 and sub
sidiary amendments were rejected by
about the same vote. When the commit
tee's proposition was about to be voted
upnn a filibuster was organized, the quo
rum cf the Senate was broken and the
question is still in the air.
Chandler in a Sensational Speech Declares
the Government Was Defrauded in Pur

Populist leaders insist that they are absolutely un
selfish in their demands upon the American people.'
This probably accounts for the fact that they so suc
cessfully suppress themselves at the polls.
The wheels of the coolie "native son" mill are al
ready being clogged in the United State* courts. It
might not be amiss for the . authorities to attempt to
trace to a white source some of the yellow perjury.
Populists are trying to persuade themselves to meet
at Kansas City at the same time as the Silver Repub
licans and the Democrats. The next thing we will
probably hear of is that a cyclone has struck the town
just to. complete the mix-up.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company intends to
raise its oriental passenger rates. There is no indi
cation, however, that the cooiie boarding-house on
the Mail Dock will be conducted at less profit. As a
boarding-house master Schwerin is a glittering suc
cess.
rROM the long reply made by the Record-Union
to the criticism of The Call upon the unjust
terms v.iih which it referred to the State Fair in
its recent exultations ever the Street Fair, it is evi
dent the criticism was not without a good Effect See
ing its attitude exposed, the Record-Union has re
pentcd and changed its attitude. It has declared it
relf not ungrateful for the benefits conferred upon
Sacrcmento by the State Fair, and for the present
seems to have attained a condition of something like
devotion to that fair, and is ready to vow that it never
tboa'slit of turning away to kneel at the shrine of any
clher fair.
It is gratifying *o perceive that our contemporary
has sorrowed unto repentance. The criticism of The
CalL'.vas designed not to hurt, but to admonish, and
the result is satisfactory. Sacramento need not decry
the general wsr of the State for the purpose of lauding
Ih-t, which has been accomplished by the cntcq)risc
of >.cr o'vncitucn?. Both are good, and now that
the P.ccord-Union has h?.d its eyes opened to that
fret :hc incident :nay be considered closed. The moral,
J-f. never, must not lie forgotten, and the .Record-'
Union. wiil ue expected tohereaftcr do justice to the
Slctc Fair without being forced to do so.
SADDER. BUT WISER.
WITH a perseverance worthy of the importance
of the cause, the postal committee of the Na
tional Board of Trade continues its campaign
of education upon the subject of reform in the ad
ministration of the Postoffice Department The ob
ject aimed at is to put an end to the excessive pay
ments now made to the railways for hauling mail,
and thus prepare the way for the establishment of a
cheaper rate of letter postage and a cheap parcels post
system. As a part of the process of education the
committee has published and is now circulating the
evidence submitted to the Joint Congressional Com
mission appointed to investigate railway mail pay by
Mr. Finley Acker, chairman of the committee.
The evidence consists of an elaborate analysis of the
testimony given and estimates made by the railway
agents, Professor Adams and Mr. Kruttschnitt The
calculations, are of a complex nature, for the railroads
throw every obstacle they can devise in the way of
getting at the facts of their charges, but the statistics
set forth show conclusively that the charges made by
the ro v ads for hauling mail are far in excess of charges
Â¦"upon freight, express or passenger traffic.
The laws determining rates for hauling mail matter
have not been changed for twenty years, while during
that time freight rates have declined 35 per cent and
passenger rates* over- 17 per cent, according to one
1 authority, and upward of 27 per cent according to

ANOTHER body of citizens has found it neces
sary to denounce the fiasco reform policy of
Mayor Phelan in shutting off the street lights
end leaving the city in darkness, to the confusion and
danger of decent people and the profit of highwaymen
ar.d asssssins.
At a meeting: of the Yerba Buena Lodge of the.
Knights cf Honor resolutions were adopted in rela
tion to the shooting of J. F. Bortzmeyer, who is a
member of the lodge. The resolutions express the
indier-^tion c f the lodge that the municipal affairs are
Â«o administered that adequate police protection is not
given to the citizens, and that men are liable to be
robbed and shot, as Bortzmeyer was, while peace
fully pursuing their way home.
The concluding resolutions are these:
Resolved, That the continual increase of depredations
by the criminal classes will make it necessary in the
near future for the fraternal organizations to form a
vigilance committee for their own protection, which
would be a reflection on the "reform povcrnraent" of this
city. Ee it further resolved, That we condemn the finan
cial policy cf this city that makes It necessary to leave
the streets In darkness after 12 o'clock at night, thereby
Increasing; the opportunities for robbery and other
crimes.
The condemnation thus pronounced will be un
doubtedly indorsed by members of all fraternal or
ganizations in the city. The darkness of the streets
hss rendered life and property so insecure that re
peated outrages against them have taken place one
after another with alarming frequency. For this evil
2>Iayor Phelan is directly responsible. He has
boasted rgain and again that the city government is
his government, and that he alone is responsible to
the people for it. The issue is up to him, and if the
people of the city are compelled to carry arms for
self-defense when they go out at night, the responsi
bility will rest upon the fiasco Mayor.

. LAND REPORT-X T. Z., San Jose.
Cal. To obtain a report of the United
AKSWEKS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
I have observed and considered with
deep Interest the many suggestions offered,
not only by your valuable paper but also
by the numerous able and earnest speak
ers who addressed the great mass-meet
ing held In Metropolitan Temple In your
city last Tuesday evening for the laudable
purpose of preventing . dv enforcing the
Chinese exclusion act with energy and to
the full extent of. the letter and spirit
of the law. that our beautiful and glorious
California and the Pacific Coast may not
be overrun by an Innumerable horde of
half-starved heathen Chinese to the det
riment and misfortune of American toll
ers and wealth-producers. In view of the
above fact it appears that bol
stered up, false and perjured testi
mony has been employed for many
years past for the express purpose of de
feating the Chinese exclusion act and en
abling an unscrupulous gang of schemers
to wax wealthy by the defeat and shame
less violation of said act.
Many years ago I read the testimony of
a very guileless Chinese maiden, a native
daughter, to be sure, who swore positively
that she saw snow from six to ten or
more inches deep on Jackson and Pacific
streets and on Telegraph Hill all winter
and every winter. And yet in the face of
all these glaring falsehoods she was al
lowed to land in the city as a native
daughter. In view of this bold disregard
of the law and of truth it would seem to
any ordinary mind that some simple act
of the Legislature could be framed and
adopted that would most effectually and
forever put a final stop to gambling In
human chattel slaves and that would re
peal and cancel forever the premium on
perjury and false swearing that now ap
pears possible in the landing of law-pro
hibited Asiatics in this copntry.
An act of the Legislature or an act of
Congress requiring ail parents to register
the birth of each and all their children
within ninety days after their birth would
seem to fill the bill exactly and would be
very Inexpensive and save much valuable
time now wasted and lost in the United
States courts and bv the collectors of
the various ports where Chinese are land
ed. When those Chinese registered na
tives, with or without their parents, take
a notion to visit China or any other for
eign ! country they could easily obtain a
copyvof^the registration , of their birth.
And ; to prevent possible fraud each In
tending traveler should appear in person
before the Recorder and give him satis
factory proof of his or her identity. The
Recorder should always investigate can
didates, demanding certificates of their
birth, as to whether they could talk; the
language of the United States or not. And
the steamship companies or other com
panies 'engaged In carrying passengers
should L be obliged to keep a list of all
such native American' Mongolians travel
ing on = their ships. And the Recorder
could 'further prevent fraud by comparing
the number of 'birth certificates issued
with the number, of Chinese births regis
tered In -his office and forcing those Mon
golian tourists by law to have their pho
fM affixed to their certificates. The difler-
Editor of The Call: I have read with
very deep interest your able and lucid ar
ticles In which you have exposed the
careless or apparently negligent means
employed In the enforcement of the Chi
nese exclusion act and how, by clever
coaching and rehearsal of a series of pre
arranged questions and answers, thou
sands of wily heathen Chinese native
sons, 90 per cent of whom are 40 years
of ago or over, are not only allowed,, to
land in San Francisco, notwithstanding
the Intended strictness and force of the
exclusion act. but they are admitted to
citizenship at the same time by the most
bold and flagrantly false testimony possi
ble to be concocted or advanced and which
would scarcely be allowed in any court
of proper Jurisdiction In the United States.
I have also carefully considered all the
remedies suggested for the closing up of
all the possible legal gaps in the Chinese
exclusion act, by and through which a
constant stream of low-living Mongolian
cheap laborers have been pouring into
California without let or hindrance
through the cunningly conceived schemes
and legal quibbles of a well organized
gang of avaricious, impecunious lawyers
and their simple-looking, innocent Chinese
partners and agents of the highbinders.
With the connivance or negligence of pub
lic officials those Asiatic hordes are driv
ing capable, honest 'American labor, both,
male and female, from every field of in
dustry. As is well known, the white
man cannot live and compete with a
race of men who live as do the
Chinese, In bunks three feet by
six by four, maintaining In the same room
all their cooking and dining utensils,
dishes, chopsticks and the whole neces
eary paraphernalia of life kept with
in their cramped, unnatural and dimin
ished sleeping apartments. These are well
known conditions under which those
hordes of filthy Mongolians live and under
which it is impossible for the American
bread-winner to live; nor should they be
forced to live or subscribe to any such
filthy, disease-breeding or death-deallngr
conditions.
ONE WAY OF STOPPING
THE CHINESE INVASION
ence is so great between an American
born Mongolian and a native Chinese
Mongolian that no American could be de
ceived by the substitution of the native
Chines* for an American Mongolian.
I believe that the honest execution of
some such simple measures as these sug
gested In this communication would solve
the problem of protecting American labor
from competition with the Chinese and
enforcing- the exclusion act as its authors
intended without fraud or failure. I am,
most respectfully,
JAMES H. DEVINE.
Sacramento, May 10, 1900.
Taken as a whole the report is one of interest and
instruction. Its official statistics speak for and of the
welfare of the State with more authority and there
fore with more influence than an ordinary pamphlet
could do. Every page of it bears evidence of the
abounding prosperity of our rural industries and at
tests.the statement of the preface: "Industry. and in
telligence when applied to a fertile soil can. under a
cloudless sky, achieve an infinity of accomplishment."
It Is pointed out that there is a large demand in the
East for California bred horses, and that a large rev
enue is realized to California from that source, and
the report adds: Â¦ "It might be well for our breeders
to.consider the Hawaiian and Philippine islands,
China and Japan, as markets for horses and mules.
The opening up of these islands and countries to
American and European occupation will certainly
create a considerable demand for such animals. Cali
fornia, because of her loca'tion, should have the first
call on that market, and if 'our breeders first occupy
the field they should be able to hold it to their own
and the State's advantage." /
The statistics relating to horses and cattle are
equally favorable. Of these it is said in the report:
"The excellence of California horses is acknowledged
all over the world. In the breeding of fine stock, not
only of horse3, but also in cattle, sheep, poultry,
swine, our State has been fortunate in the enterprise
of her wealthy citizens. They searched the world and
brought from its uttermost limits the finest specimens
of breeding stock. From these animals and their
descendants the State has grown famous."
California produces about 6 per cent of the wheat
crop of the United States, and while the average yield
per acre for the whole country in 1895 was but little
over twelve bushels, that of California exceeded four
teen bushels. The income from the crop is estimated
at more than $21,000,000. Barley, which is the only
cereal crop our farmers rotate on their wheat fields,
yielded about $8,460,000. The deciduous fruits
shipped out of the State during the year filled 6924
cars, and it is explained that owing to the increased
weight carried by cars that season the shipment was
equivalent to 7408 cars of previous yfars. Dried
fruit shipments for the year are estimated as follows,
in pounds: Peaches. 8,000,000; apricots, 5,000,000;
apples, 5.000,000; pears, 4,000,000; plums, 2,500,000;
nectarines, 1,500,000; dried grapes, 2,500,000; figs,
2,000.000; prunes, 96,500,000; and raisins, 70,000,000.
The canning industry packed for the year 3,000,000
cases of fruit, 561,000 cases of tomatoes and 135,000
cases of other vegetables. The citrus fruit yield was
10,875 carloads, or 3.654,000 boxes, and that of
almonds and walnuts amounted to 12,200,000 pounds.
The wine output was about 14,000,000 gallons, the out
put of beet sugar was 18,300 short tons, and the honey
product is estimated at over 1,020,000 pounds.
The statistics which follow in the course of the re
port amply justify the high-sounding claims of the
preface. In fact, in undertaking to make a digest of
it we will have to copy that very language and pre
mise that we cannot set forth all the prosperity re
vealed in the facts and figures of the report, but
must confine ourselves to a few of the more notable
features, leaving the rest- to be inferred from what is
stated.

Governor: "To make this report complete would be
impossible, and we will not attempt it. In California
the problem of existence and human happiness can
be wrought out in countless forms. Industry and in
telligence, when applied to a fertile soil, can, under
a cloudless sky, achieve an infinity of accomplishment.
We will concern ourselves with a review only of our
most extensive products, leaving our countless wealth
in other directions to be. inferred from the condi
tions which such a review discloses."
OUR AGRICULTURAL WEALTH-
The case of Dr. Selfridge had reached extremes.
The veracious lupus had consumed the tissue of the
face. ur.t:3 butÂ»I:tt'e lime seemed left before the end
would come. To arrest its progress, turn its attack
end rebuild the healthy tissue so extensively that the
remaining scar is only a fraction of the devastated
Eurface, is a result highly gratifying to the rescued
victim, snd of the highest importance to mankind.
No application of any scientific discovery is of
greater interest to humanity than this. The progress
Oi cancer in its various forms has been steady. Every
year it claims a greater number of victims. Medical
sclenc* has been powerless in its presence. It has
consumed unchecked in a vast majority of attacks.
THE experience of Dr. Self ridge, with that of
others which preceded it, seems to raise the
hope that an odium of the medical profession is
about to be removed. Cancer is a disease of civili
zation. It is unknown among the primitive races.
But heretofore civilization and science have found no
efficient remedy. In some forms the surgeon's knif/;
has proved able to extirpate it, sometimes perma
nently, but has r.ct been proof against a recurrence
that depends upon a cancerous diathesis. The us? of
the X ray now seems a more certain dependence for
complete cure than any that has been discovered. We
don't know, for it is not stated, that the ray has been
applied to ether than the epithelial forms. But these
Lre the most common, for even when the oral cavity
arid its parts and organs are the seat of the disease, its
beginning appears to be in the epithelial cells. If the
ray act upon this form there seems to be no reason
why it should not be effective also in carcinoma,
which begins with a tumor and perhaps invests the
epithelial cells with the same deadly quality which
comes also of their own degeneration.
CANCER AND THE X R0Y.
So, the candidacy of the imbued candidate was
launched upon the country. He is declared to be in
full accord with the platform. It will be seen that
the Kansas City platform will be largely a copy of
this one, to save Colonel Bryan from seeming to ride
a iiorse and a jackass going in opposite directions.
The speech by the president, Mr. Patterson of
Colorado, is an interpretation and commentary on the
platform. He said they did not nominate Colonel
Bryan to pleaseJthe Democrats, for whose will and
pleasure the Populists cared nothing. He was nomi
nated because he "is imbued with the spirit of Popu
lism declared at Omaha."
This platform, which more nearly resembles political
jaundice and a bilious liver than anything else in na
ture, is an all-round snarl at everything that is, and we
leave it to reasonable people to say whether they want
the country ruled by such a declaration rather than by
the constitution as it is.
The rest of the platform is devoted to postal sav
ings banks, injunctions and imperialism. As evidence
of its determination to cut and hack in all directions
the convention denounced the Populist Governor of
Idaho for the proceedings at Wardner.
The creative energies of the convention were spent
in the prolonged exhibit of its financial and expansion
ideas. It is willing to expand a little, but not much.
But if much expansion be wrong, any expansion is
wrong.
The grave conditions that have followed the Span
ish war have no solution under this platform that
squares with common sense, or justice to anybody.
It is a compromise to retain in Populist ranks its two
well-known factions, which otherwise would go to
war over expansion.
If one is part of the territory of the United States,
both are. If so, neither can be alienated, under the
decision of the Civil War.
This inconsistency does not seem to disturb the
proponents of the platform, but it is a warning to
those who intend that this shall remain a constitutional
Government. It is a forecast of the confusion that
will follow the elevation of Mr. Bryan to the Presi
dency, if that lamentable accident should occur.
With that inconsistency which always goes with
these theories of government, the platform which has
swept every constitutional guarantee away, in pursuit
of what it calls "social and economic freedom," then
declares that: 'The Declaration of Independence,
the constitution and the flag are one and inseparable,"
and arraigns the Republican party for violation of the
constitution, and declares Porto Rico to be "a part
of the territory of the United States." Of course if
Porto Rica is/the Philippines are also, for they both
come to us by identical process and in the same treaty.
Yet the platform' demands that Porto Rico be held
and that the Philippines be alienated 1
We submit that the plan promulgated by Colonel
Bryan's Sioux Falls platform is naked communism,
with anarchy close behind it.
Jefferson did not believe that the rule of the major
ity would be always right, for he said that to be right
it must be reasonable. To reduce it to reason the
constitut ; on provided the admirable system of checks
and balances and erected the rationalizing force of the
courts. . .
This revolutionary change in our system of govern
ment seems to be based upon the theory that the
whole people, being incapable of electing incorrupt
ible representatives to make laws, are thereby proved
capable of making the laws themselves. With the
courts abolished and the Legislatures sent glimmer
ing nothing stands against the sovereign tyranny of a
majority. It may be a majority of one, and its will
and purpose may be the destruction of the personal
and property rights of any one disliked by that major
ity of one; but there is no power left to rationalize, to
reduce to reason, the will of that majority, nor protect
the rights of the minority which it may strike down.
Mr. Bryan's Sioux Falls platform sweeps all this
away, and on the theory which it declares that "a ma
jority of the people cannot be corrupted" obsoletes
the legislative and judicial branches of the Govern
ment, abolishes them utterly and substitutes for them
direct legislation, in the ballot box, by the whole
people.
It will be seen that to make this change in the Gov
ernment effective for the purpose it is to serve the
courts must be destroyed. They are now the rational
izing branch of the Government. They pass upon the
constitutionality of legislation. The powers which the
Government may exercise are expressly granted and
limited in the constitution. Among those powers the
manufacture and production of the commodities in
which trusts deal are not included nor contemplated,
nor is the public ownership of transportation. The
constitution provides for a representative Govern
ment, not direct lawmaking by the people. The con
stitution puts all personal and property rights under
judicial shelter.
proposes as a remedy for trusts that "ownership be
assumed and exercised by the people." It demands
that such ownership and control be extended to rail
roads and telegraphs, and that to efficiently take over
to public ownership all the business now in the
hands of the trusts, and the railroads and telegraphs,
and to municipal ownership all public utilities, the
people "must act directly, without the intervention of
representatives, who may be controlled or influenced.
We therefore demand direct legislation, giving the
people the lawmaking and veto power under the ini
tiative and referendum."
THE FUSION PLATFORM.
T~) ESIDES its demand for the debasement of our
\\ credit and our currency the Sioux Falls plat
â form on which Colonel Bryan is nominated
The issue of postal reform is now one of the most
imperative in the administration of our domestic af
fairs. So long as there is an annual deficit in the de
partment it will be impossible to bring about the es
tablishment of the cheaper postage, a parcels post and
postal savings banks. The railroads have been per
mitted to 10b and plunder the treasury through the
Postoffice Department for too long a time, and the
National Board of Trade is doing a good service for
the country in making a persevering effort to put an
end to the wrong.
First class mall matter covers, as you will see, the
product of the masses, or bo we will term It for the pur
poses of this arprument. Every man, woman and child
above the age of six years is directly interested in this
class, for it represents their direct taxation for the sup
port of this branch of the public service, and we have
oftentimes wondered why a long-suffering: people have
remained practically silent through all these years, for
60,000,000 people have long been taxed from thirty to forty
million dollars a year more than it costs to transmit
their mall matter In order that a very small privileged
class, embracing but a few thousand, might be Indulged
In the luxury of pursuing a legitimate, and. In most
cases, a very profitable business. Your committee do not
think they draw it too strongly when they say that tho
masses have been deliberately and outrageously robbed
to foster, protect and encourage one limited business
Interest of the country at the expense of tho many.
The committee quotes with approval from the re
port of the House Committee on Postoffice Affairs in
1896 the declaration:
. .Evidence of gross over-payments to the railroads
was found in every direction the investigation took.
Thus, in addition to the excessive payments for haul
ing the mail, it is disclosed in the report that the
Government pays an extra charge, averaging $6250
per year, for the use of each special mail or so-called
postoffice car, notwithstanding the fact that these cars
cost only, from $2500 to $4000.
another. The Government pays annually for railway
mail transportation over $34,000,000, or, according to
the testimony of Professor Adams himself at the rate
of ' iaj4 cents per ton per mile, while the railways
carry single commuration passengers at as low rates
as 3 cents per ton per mile. Were the mails carried
at the commutation passenger rates, the Government
would save $25,000,000 a year on' that one item alone.

Claims Against School Funds.
In response to an Inquiry from District
Attorney R. R. Fowler of Madera County
Attorney General Ford has rendered an
opinion that where a school has been
maintained in a school district for at
least eight months during the school year
the trustees may use any of the unex
pended balance remaining to the credit
of the school for that year (excepting tha
fund received from the State) In the pay
ment of any claim outstanding against
the district.
A trouble that at one time threatened
to embroil every workman on the front
has at last been settled. As a result of
the fight there is now an Independent
Ship-Joiners' Association, which bids fair
to be one of the most powerful organiza
tions in labor circles.
Several weeks ago a few members of
the Ship and Steamboat Joiners' Union
thought they had a grievance against the
contractor for the repairs on the trans
port Westminster. The matter was laid
before tbe union and the joiners were or
dered to quit. Forty-five of the men re
fused, and they were fined all the way
from $25 to J50 each for their refusal. The
fines were not paid. The officers of the
Ship and Steamboat Joiners' Association
then laid the matter before the Labor
Council and a general strike on the con
tractor was ordered.
A delegation composed of Messrs. Mc-
Carthy, Saunders and Rosenberg was ap
pointed to meet the shipwrights and ask
them to demand the dismissal of the 107
men on the Westminster working as ship-
Joiners. President McConnell, speaking
for the Shipwrights' Association, asked
for a week to think the matter over and
arrange some means of settlement. The
request was denied. Then the shipwrights
refused to have anything to do with the
strike and pointclank refused to walk out.
Among the men fined were "Joe" Bow
ers and "Bob" Driscoll. They refused to
pay and at once went to Â¦work and form
al a union which is called the "Ship-Join
ers' Independent Association." Nearly all
the members of the old order Joined it.
Bowers was elected president and Driscoll
secretary. At its last meeting the Ship
and Steamboat Joiners rescinded its reso
lutions In regard to fines and boycott, but
its action came too late.
Japanese for Victoria.
The steamer Queen arrived yesterday
from Puget Sound ports with nearly -300
of the little brown men in her steerage.
There was a crowd of runners down to
meet the Queen when she came in and
among them were a number of Japanese,
The latter were in the employ of the reg
ular runners, but as they had no licenses
Officers Dower and Keith arrested them
and charged them at the Harbor police
station with soliciting without a license.
Half an hour after the Queen docked
nearly every one of the Japanese was on
hi3 way uptown.

If now due the sum of $4500. Schramm
eaid that his only Income was derived
through concerts â¢ given by his little
daughter, which was only sufficient to
prc\-Ide for their -wants and educate the
child. He said that the stories of his

Third Annual Gathering of the
CYCLE DEALERS MEET
AT THE BANQUET BOARD
It Is thin situation, so it is said, that
has determined the backers of the Denvei
and Rio Grande to build to California.
Thi3 road taps nearly every important
mining town In Colorado and there are
millions of capital behind It. Nothing as
to the proposed route of the new road is
yet known.
Agent J. M. Crowley of the Rio Grande
Western said yesterday that he had heard
his road had purchased the Colorado Mid
land but that he did not know of it of
ficially. He characterized the story of the
Denver and Rio Grande Intending to build
to California as a "rainbow."
It Is Bald' In railroad circles that the
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad Is to
be extended to the Pacific Coast, with a
terminal somewhere in the southern part
of this State. Recent railroad happen
ings in Colorado firmly support this state
ment. It Is said that this determination
on the part of the Denver and Rio Grande
owners was brought about through a deal
by which its Western outlet was cut oft
by a rival road. The Denver and Rio
Grande could biill do business over the
tracks of its rival, but not on terms aa
advantageous as before the deal men
tioned was consummated.
The deal referred to was the purchase
of the Colorado Midland by the Rio
Grande Western people. This important
purchase, of which but little has been
said, is stated to have taken place quite
recently. Under the arrangement that ex
isted before this purchase the Colorado
Midland and the Denver and Rio Grande
(who were rivals for the business of the
State of Colorado and both of which ter
minated at Grand Junction) secured their
Western outlet from that place through
the Rio Grande Western. They were
given equal terms by the latter road and
as far as Western business was concerned
neither had an advantage.
The purchase of the Colorado Midland
by the Rio Grande Western and the mak
ing of the former road, with all its feeders
In the State, a part of the latter's system
at once placed tho Denver and Rio Grande
at a disadvantage. As matters now stand
âif the statement regarding the purchase
is correctâ the Denver and Rio Grande Is
absolutely at the mercy of the Rio
Grande Western and not In a position to
compete in the matter of Colorado's
freight and passenger business with this
coast.

There is trouble among the thirty odd
passengers who left here March 12 on
the ex-missionary brig Pitcairn for Cajhi
Nome. At that time The Call pointed out
the difficulties that would be encountered
In a voyage to the frozen north at that
time of the year and said the gold-hunterÂ»
were only "wasting their time and the
Â»hip her provisions In such an early start.
Captain Nesbitt asserted, however, that
no matter what came or went he would
be somewhere In the vicinity of the gold
fields in May and as a last resort would
land his passengers on the ice and allow
them to taake their way to Nome on
From last accounts tiio Pitcairn was
In Dutch Harbor with the passengers In
a state of mutiny. They had deposed Cap
tain NeÂ«bltt ar.d placed the chief officer
in charge cf the vessel. The provisions
were"not what they should have been on
a Das c enger vessel and all in all the men
or the Pitcairn were having a hard time.
Air'ong those who went away on the
miss:or;ary hrtg was Ed Short, the well
known wharfinger at Mission-street
wharf. In a letter he sent to San Francis
co en the steamer Homer from Dutch
Harbor lie cays that the PJtcalrn Is not
thorough! v provisioned; that there Is no
break in the Ice in Bering Straits and that
the chances axe It will be June before a
sailing vessel can make any kind of an
approach to the gold fields. The brig took
forty-Feven days to make the run to
Dutch Harbor and that fact made all the
passeneers down on the captain. A meet
ing was held and his resignation demand
ed, after which the chief officer was made
captain.
The exodus of vessela to Cape Nome
beg-ar. yesterday. The Aloha and Santa
Ana got away last nlgrht. The latter goes
to Seattle, where a full list of passengers
await her. The Aloha went out with not
a spare berth on the 6hip. The Charles
Xe!sor. goes out to-day. It also goes to
Seattle to take en passecgrers. On Mon
day the Senator, loaded to the guards,
will get away ar.d on Tuesday the Hanler,
Ohio, Lisella and San Pedro will start.

Manufacturing In large quantities
and burins by the carload enable
Pattosien's to cut the prices so much
lower than those who must buy in lim-
ited Quantities. The confidence of the

opens the way to dispose ot these large
quantities, and bo the live principle of J
trade, "the more you sell the more you i
buy. and the more you buy the cheaper j
you ca.n sell," is exemplified and main-
talncd. The application of this prin- |
ci; e is the power that has placed Pat- '
token's in the front rank in the Carpet i
ji.:id Furniture trade on the Pacific i
< oast.
It is a pleasure to see the crowds of '
sensible housekeepers hastening to se-
cure the honest barg-aina spread out be- j
fore their eyes.
Some of the customers yesterday had
never visited the second floor of the big
Furniture Exposition Building, corner
fcixteenth and Mission streets, and they
looked in er>ellbound -wonder at the
scene of beauty there displayed. Col-
umn upon column could be written
about the array and assortment of Par-

The committees appointed by the Civic
Federation to investigate the Items of the
tax levy made partial reports last even
ing at a meeting of that body. It was
shown there was a great deal of extrav
agance in the local government, and May
or Phelan was criticized for not trying to
stop the expenditure of funds through the
employment of useless city attaches.
Many cases of laxity were shown. The
Fire Department also came in for its
share of criticism. It was stated that it
v.as the most costly department In the
United States. The committees will con
tinue their investigations and will file
written reports with the association on
Saturday evening next.
Discussed Municipal Affairs.
Excursion Trips Over Unbeaten Paths.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Co. has
Just Issued a pamphlet entitled "Alaska
Excursions," by which it is learned they
have opened some new Excursion Routes
which will doubtless prove .Interesting to
that portion of the public desiring to visit,
either for profit or pleasure, that part of
our country which to-day is attracting so
much attention. "We quote from the pam
phlet In question as follows:
"Special attention Is called to an Excur
sion Trip starting from San Francisco,
Seattle or Tacoraa to Skaguay. thence by
the White Pass and Yukon Railway to
White Horse, thence down the Yukon
River by the Canadian Development Co.'s,
steamers to Dawson, thence by any of
the steamers of the three principal trans
portation companies operating on the
Lower Yukon to St. Michael, thence to
Isome by any of the three or four most
prominent steamship lines operating there
and from Nome to either Seattle or San
Francisco by the Pacitic Coast Steamship
Co.. Pacific Steam Whaling Co., North
American Transportation and Trading
Co., Alaska Exploration Co., Alaska Com
mercial Co. or the Kmpire line."
Passengers taking this excursion will be
permitted to stop over at Seattle, Ska
guay. White Horse, Dawson. St. Michael
and Nome, leaving Nome not later than
October 1.
The distances are approximately as fol
lows: San Francisco to Seattle. 850 miles-
Seattle to Skaguay, 1000; Skaguay to
White Horse, HO; White Horse to Daw
son, 450; Dawson to St. Michael, 1315- st
Michael- to Nome, 125; Nome to Seattle,
2400; Nome to San Francisco direct. 2700
Parties Intending to make the trip
should calculate on at least a month's
time, although If connections are made
at^all points the trip could be made in a
Bhade under a month. It would figure
about as follows: San Francisco to Se
attle, 4 days; Seattle to Skaguay, 4 days-
Skaguay to White Horse, 1 day; White
Horse to Dav.-pon, 2 days; Dawson to St
Michael. 5 days; St. Michael to Nome, i
day; Nome to Seattle, 10 days; Nome to
San Francisco direct, 11 days.
The cost of this excursion from San
Francisco Is $262, or from Seattle ?250. As
this includes meals and sleeping accom
modations on the steamers and lw) pounds
of baggage,- the fare, considering the
time occupied and distance covered (over
C500 miles). Is exceedingly low.
The writer grows eloquent over the
beauties of the trip. Note the following:
"Where in all the world can one find the
counterpart of a trip like this? Five days
through the Inland Passage with Its pla
cid waters and thousands of Islands; over
the White Pass with its rugged moun
tain scenery, unsurpassed anywhere in
the world; down the Yukon River with
its lakes and varied scenery to Dawson.
the celebrated Klondike country; thence
on floating palaces still down the mighty
Yukon to St. Michaelâthe Government
reservation; thence to Nome, the richest
gold fields ever discovered, where the
sands of the beach are sands of gold, and
where may be seen the Midnight 'Â¦ Sun;
thence down the Bering Sea, past the cel
ebrated Seal Â¦ Islands, and through the
Unimak Pass to Seattle or San Francisco.
Another excursion trip that will
Interest those Reeking novelty and the
unbeaten paths Is that by the steamship
Senator sailing from Seattle on or about
July 21, 1900, for Nome. On the trip in
question this new and splendid - steel
steamship will carry a limited number of
excursionists, and with a view of making
the voyage novel. Interesting and instruc
tive will, take the Inland Passage outward
bound, calling at Wraugel. Juneau, Ska
guay, Glacier Bay and Sltka, passing en
route the beautiful La Perouse glacier,
also the Malaspina glacier (probably the
largest in the world), also In sight of the
magnificent Mount Fairweather and the
mighty Mount St. Ellas (the highest; in
North America), thence passing Prince
Williams Sound and through Shelikoff
Straits, within sight of PavelofT and Sis
haldin volcanoes.* thence via Unimak
Pass and Seal Islands to Nome, return
ing via St. Michael, Unimak Pass, thence
direct to Seattle.
Here Is an opportunity of a lifetime to
make a trip most unique. Interesting and
instructive. â¢ -. ,.
The cost of this trip is $224 first cabin, 1
$174 second cabin. It will take â¢ about
thirty days to make the trip. . .
The pamphlet referred to shows the
cabin accommodations of - the-steamers
and contains much valuable data .with
reference to the excursions , in question,
together with ."â¢ the; regular . excursions
which the company makes every summer
to Southeastern Alaska, Including Muir
glacier and t all points of interest. This
publication can:be obtained free by call

World's Eecord Badly Fractured by

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 12.â Harvard
athletes upheld well the' position of the
college to-day in the dual games with
Yale, winning: so easily that the final re
sult stood 62Â»j against Tale's 41^ points.
Boal broke the record in the hammer
throw by 14 feet, his best throw being 144
feet 2*Â£ inches. The track on Soldiers
Field was used to-day for the first time.
It is not as fast as the old track on
Holmes Field, but It was at its best this
afternoon. On account of the strong wind
blowing- down the straightaway course
the Judges decided to run all the events
which did not use the circular track in
the opposite direction from usual, so that
the athletes -could run with the wind.
Johnson of Yale cleared 11 feet in the
pole vault twice in succession, but each
time knocked the bar off with his hands
His vault of 10 feet 8 inches is, however
a record. Every trial in the 100-yard daÂ«h
was run In record time, 10 1-5 seconds
Richards of Yale winning the final heat
in that time. In the two-mile run not
a single Yale man was . able to finish
Richardson b*Â»at Foote out by about three
feet in the fast time of 9:57 3-5. This is
a new record, as the event was put on
the card for the first time this year. The

There is v a brickmaking plant at the
Napa asylum, from which brick for its

he had written to Dr. Gardner, superin
tendent at Napa. asking if they could
furnish 125,000 brick for Agrnews. Dr.
Gardner had replied that Napa could fur
nish the brick, and that in a few days
he would quote prices for the brick laid
down at Alviso. This action of the man
agers will create consternation among*
local brick men, and they will" undoubt
edly take steps to prevent the asy
lum -from being a- competitor. \ It is be
lieved the price of the Xapa bricks will
not be more than half that asked by local
dealers., ..->-' "*
SAN JOSE, May 12.â The board of man
agers of Agnews Insane Asylum object
to what they claim Is an exorbitant rate
asked by local brlckmakers and are ne
gotiating to have 125,000 brick manufac
tured at the Napa asylum for the new
brick cottage to be built at Agnews. In
a report filed by O. A. Hale, chairman of
the construction committee, he stated
that local brick men are asking $9 per 1000
for brick. He considers this exorbitant,
as two years ago these same dealers fur
nished brick for the asylum cottages at
$6 per 1000, and the cost of labor is no
greater now than it was at that time.

VALLEJO, May 12.â John Frey, the
father of Vallejo's new water system, and
also of .many and divers other great bene
ficiary movements In the interest of Val
lejo, died last night at his Vallejo home
after a long and painful illness. He has
suffered several attacks of perytasis of
late, and when the end cams it was not
entirely unexpected. ,
He leaves, besides his widow, five chil
dren â John, Henry G., Prank, Mrs. J. H.
O'Hara and Mrs. Ed McDonnell. He was
a native of Germany and was 64 years and
5 months old when he died. He came to
Vallejo in 1S72.
THE LATE JOHN FREY.
Owing to the heat and smoke and gase
ous air in the tunnel the firemen can only
enter a short distance without be
ing overcome. Holes were dug in the
street to make vents and the roof of the
tunnel was blasted, but to no avail.
Shortly after the collision Lamtell dis
appeared and could not be found until he
gave himself up late this afternoon. When
questioned he said:
"I did it. Why the white signal re
mained in place I do not know, but It waÂ«
there and the train went through as
usual. I was asleep or dozing, and why I
cannot say. except that I felt myself
overworked; but I am ready to stand the
censor and take what oomes to me. I
have no excuse to offer."
Fire immediately broke out and three of
the cars, each containing 4000 gallons of
oil, exploded. Soon the wreckage was a
mass of flames. The fire department was
called out, and though- the firemen have
been at work all last night and all to-day
it has been impossible as yet to extin
guish the flames.
The tunnel runs under Twenty-fifth
street, from Callowhill etreet to Fair
mount Park, a distance of 2S00 feet. It is
a semi-circle, and the tracks are up grade
from the Callowhill-street entrance.
Every night a train known as the night
freight express leaves here for New York.
Last night that train was made up in
two sections,' the first section containing
forty-three cars. When It reached the
tunnel the engine was unable to pull it
up the grade and seventeen cars were de
tached and left standing in the tunnel
while the others were drawn through. It
was the duty of the tower operator to set
a red signal on the semaphore at the Cal
lowhill-street entrance to the tunnel. Be
fore he fell asleep, as he admits, he failed
to do this, leaving the white light in view.
At 11:30 o clock the second section of the
freight, comprising thirty-eight cars, ap
proached at the rate of thirty miles an
hour. Engineer L&ub, seeing the whit*
signal, gave the engine extra speed in or
der to carry the train up the grade. The
rapidly moving train collided witht the
standing cars in the tunnel with terrific
force.
PHILADELPHIA. May 12.-Through
the negligence of a towerman, who lay
asleep at his post, a disastrous and fatal
freight train wreck occurred here last
midnight in a tunnel on the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad. An engineer and fire
man were 'killed and five unknown tramps
are supposed to be dead in the wreck. The
property loss is estimated at $185,000. The
man who was responsible for the accident,

CHICAGO, May 12.â Proposed changes
In the organic law of Â» the church again
came to the fore at to-day's session of the
Methodist Episcopal General Conference
by the presentation of the report of the
speciar commission appointed four years
agro to revise the law.
Section 4 of article. Ill of the constitu
tion as presented by the chairman of the
commission;- was ; approved, and articles
IV and V, providing for the. Issuance of
credentials,' were adopted without dis
pute.
, Delegate George E." Elliott. of Philadel
phia met defeat in an attempt to secure
still further recognition for laymen. He
worked in a resolution to make laymen
and local ministers eligible as Bishops, a
privilege at present confined to traveling
preachers 'Or elders. Delegate Neeley,
also of Philadelphia, arose and made a
motion to table Dr. Elliott's resolution,
which was done amid applause, showing
the prevailing Opinion that ministers alone
should be made Bishops. â¢ .
The section of the book of discipline re
quiring 1 a separate vote of ministers and
laymen on questions involving changes in
the book was ordered stricken out by the
Eassage of a resolution -introduced by
â¢elegate Douglass. p â¢ .
The committee on the state of the
church, headed by ex-Governor Pattison
of Pennsylvania, sent a quartet of secre
taries of organization benevolences to the
anxious seat by Introducing the following
report:
We recommend that there be but one general
secretary for each of the organized benevolences
of the churchj who shall be the executive offi
cer.
This proposition cuts off four general
secretaries serving on annual salaries of
$4500 each, the Mission Society now hav
ing, three secretaries and the Church Ex
tension Society and Freedman's Aid So
ciety two each.
The board of Bishops appointed the fol-,
lowing committee to consider changes in
the organic law during the next quadren
nium: J. M. Buckley, D. H. Moore, T. B.
Neeley, J. W. Hamilton. J. L. Hayes, "W.
R. Warnock, C. W. Smith, A. B." Leonard,
C. B. Lore, F. M. Simons, J. F. Goucher.
\V. H.Shior. S. -M. Coon. A. J. Wallace
and G. H. Bridgman.
Inability of the committee on Episco
pacy to decide what to do In the cases of
several Bishops whose retirement is dis
cussed made it impossible to report to
day. The curiosity of the spectators was
whetted for. the report that was to be pre
sented to-day, but the committee was al
lowed an extension of time until Tues
day.

When Captain Carrington, U. S. A., was
under detail from the War Department in
the capacity of instructor and Inspector
of the National Guard of this State, from
which duty he was relieved to go. to the
front during the Spanish- American war,
he criticized the condition of the guard
in pretty strong terms because it was not
ready for service In a "hurry quick" call:
Those who have made a study of the
guard of this State during the past six
months declare that it is now In a^worse
condition than It was at the time Captain
Carrington presented his report, as it is
without those articles of . equipment 'that
are most needed In .case of emergency.
They say that there is lack of tentage,
blankets, kitchen and mess furniture. It
is true that there are uniforms and rifles,
but that Is not all that the guardsmen re
quire. -- .. â¢ --Â¦â iâ ~. ..._..
At the time the general election was

Schwerdtfeger of Company K was elect

pasted. the examining board. "When an
election was called for last Thursday to
fill these vacancies ' the two sought to be
elected again,. but upon inquiry they dis
covered that there is a law "that- no one
after rejection can appear again for -the
same commission within six months after
having failed -to qualify. .To overcome
this section of the law Riley presented
himself for captain and Schwerdtfeger
was to have been proposed for first lieu
tenant. .When the election was about to
proceed Riley was nominated against
Thomas Cunningham, the former captain,
whose term had expired. .Major Hendy,
who presided at the election, declared
after the nominations. that under Instruc
tions from brigade headquarters he would
not consider the Â¦ candidacy, of ;: Riley.
Thereupon the name was withdrawn, . but
the recorder was requested j to' note B an

WEBSTER AND O'BRIEN
DIFFER ON SANITATION
Health Officer Denies That Humboldt*
and Agassiz Schools Are in a
Sad Condition.
Health Officer O'Brien informed the
Board of Education yesterday, that both
the Humboldt and Agasslz Primary
schools are In perfect sanitary condition.
These are the two schools which were re
ported by Superintendent Webster as be
ing in such a state that' four pupils at
tending them had died from diphtheria.
Dr. O'Brien presents the reports of In
spectors Hassler and Dr. Fltzgibbons.who
state that .the drainage of the building
Is good and the rooms large, , light and
well ventilated. Attention is called to the
fact that the floors of the school are
washed but once in three months. The
dry sweeping results in the. air becom
ing more or less laden with the constant

Eighth streets, on the charge of rob
bery was commenced yesterday before
Judge Mogaa. They are accused of hold-
Ing up and stealing ?21 50 from Wing
Chung, a Chinese laundryman at 1015 Mis
sion street, who is familiarly known
eouth of the slot as "Jim Murphy." The
robbery is alleged to have occurred on
April 25.
wing Is a thoroughly Americanized Chi
nese and he speaks good Anglo-Saxon.
His testimony amused the court and spec
tators. He eaid he was in the habit of
taking a drink with his customers and on
April 25 he was in Mrs. Brannan's gro
cery, â¬4" Minna street, and he shook dice
with her for the drinks. He lost and he
had to stand the drinks for the crowd.
They shook aÂ£ain and he won. but Mrs.
Brahman only gave him a drink. Just then
the three defendants came In and Dunn
said. "Hello. Murphy, are you going to
treat?" Wing said he would shake for the
drinks or the "tin roof." The Judge in
terrupted Wing by asking what he meant
by the "tin roof.*
"The drinks on the house," replied Wing
In a surprised tone. Wing said he would
shake razzle-dazzle for half a dollar and
the winner would stand the drinks. They
shook the dice and Wing won. Then Dunn
suggested they should shake for a dollar
and when Wing won Dunn raked in the
money.
"I changed a $20 gold piece." continued
Wing, "and when I had eight or nine
drinks 1 picked up my basket and said
â¢good-by." As I walked out of the door
the three men followed me. They hit mÂ»
and pulled my basket over my head and
â¢while they were robbing me my head was
pulled through the oasket. They took
521 50 from me."
"Was It lawful money of the United
States?" asked, the Judge.
'"No. it was Melican money," replied
wing.

"la the Interests of tbe taxpayers of
mv locality ar.d for myself I desire to
lodge respectfully an emphatic protest
against the rearing of wooden fences or
other structures to be used for advertising
purposes above a height of twelve feet at
the rocst."
A protest was filed yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors by John T. Scott of
S^Â» HayeÂ« street against the recomm>n
,^V?vi Â°f tJie Judiciary Committee that
i&3SfciÂ£'ht of fences or structures u^ed for
advertising signboards be limited to
tweaty feet.
"I had thought," says Mr. Scott In hi*
communication, "that this subject was
settled with a limit of ten feet in height,
and many taxpaylng citizens as well as
myself have been congratulating our
seives on your wise Judgment. The corner
lots next to my residence are vacant and
surrounded by advertising signboards
from twenty to twenty-four feet high.
They are exceedingly unsightly to visitors
to our city and sources of great annoy
ance to those living in proximity to
th*:m, and thev have succeeded in creating
some of the dlrtle6t streets in our city.
The sidewalk? and streets are at most
times Uttered with paper which has been
torn troza these boards and all kinds of
dirt collects in streets near them. The
Â¦wind carries the^e papers and sweeps
them several blocks down Hayes street,
driving dirt and litter into the stores of
the merchants doing business on that
street end 1? a source of constant annoy
ance to tbe taxpayers.
"Another great evil which the high
signboards are aggravating Is the undis
puted fact that thÂ«y obstruct the sun
from having free access into many homes
where our children are- growing. In this
city, where sunlight is more essential than
artificial heat to the health of the child
as well as to the grown people. It becomes
almost criminal to deprive our citizens of
the least bit of Its great benefit.

SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED
Many Names Have Been
Omitted in the Returns
of Chief Marshal.
Webster Has Hade an Official Inves
â¢ tigation and Will Correct the
Figures fo Mayor Phelan's
Appointees.
Superintendent of Schools Webster Is
dissatisfied with the returns filed by Chief
Census Marshal Elbert and will take steps
immediately to increase the figures by at
least 1500 names. Under the law the School
Superintendent's authorized to order a
new census If he is satisfied that through
the neglect or incompetency of the census
deputies proper returns of children â¢ be
tween thte ages of 5 and 17 years have, not
been made. Webster will not go so far
In his. effort "to secure a : correct list of
school, children, but from ; investigations
which he has made on his own account hÂ«
will increase the number as returned by
the census marshal. 1 . - !
The Importance of this will be apparent
when it is known that the State pays an
average of $9 per' name to tlie city and
county for every child eligible to attend
school. ,â¢ By Webster's action the school
fund will be enriched by- nearly $15,000.
The investigation by the Superintendent
consisted in sending notices to parents of
children' attending school when the census
taken by Elbert and his 'assistants was
first begun. These notices requested the
parents to return a list of all children be
tween 5 and 17; years of age, whether they
attended school or not. "The returns came
in very rapidly. Upon Â¦ comparing them
with the returns sworn .to by the census
deputies Webster discovered that nearly
1500 of the names which he had received
were missing. Under the law Webster
may add. them to the census marshal's re
port. . Â¦ . -
The total enrollment as returned, by El
bert has not been completely added yet,
but he believes that it will be less than
that of last year, which was 75,292. The
figures for the year will approximate oniy
74,000, but 1 by the addition of omitted
names discovered by Superintendent Web
ster the figures will equal those of last
year and probably exceed them by several
hundred. -Â¦ Â¦ *â¢
Superintendent Webster ascribes the de
ficient enrollment to the incompetency of
the deputies forced upon Marshal Elbert.
It is' significant that the Board of Educa
tion, which made the appointments, knew
absolutely . nothing about the qualifica
tions of the men they selected. The list
was furnished by the Mayor, who prob
ably relieved himself In that way of some
of the political obligations he had incurred
during the last campaign. Elbert himself
complained of his subordinates and some
were 'removed as a result. But those
whose "pull" was greater retained their
places and an incomplete enrollment re
sulted.

The angry taxpayers certainly have

Ever since construction commenced own

stand some loss in order to hold their
business until the prosperous era which
they were confident would dawn with the
opening of the new hall. For months
and months stores fitted up at much ex

It cost for this work bringing no return to
the owners. Where leases were made the
tenants have carried on business at great
loss, doing little else than pay rent and
other bills. This is still going on day
after day, and when the end wUl come no
one knows.
One man has erected a three-story stone
and brick building at the corner of Dun
bar, ally and Merchant street. The upper
floors are empty and the lower floors are
occupied by a tenant who has nothing to
do but to pay rent and wonder how long
he* can -hold' out. Restaurants have been

have been fitted un for tenants, and mer

that the girls of the home passed on re

she selected Lee Yuen to make Quon
happy.
Quon was sent for and came last Fri

For many years Quon. the proud groom

Quon was a faithful servant and Mrs.
tle and land owner was shirking his obli
gations to the State because of the light
ness of his assessment and the large
amount of business he was doing. The
property lies -partly In- California and
partly across tne line in Nevada, and it
is an easy matter, to drive the herds from
one State to another.
Last March Assessor Hayes and two
deputies went on the ground for the pur
pose of getting at the facta. For this hv
ana the deputies were roundlv abused by
the owner. Xot finishing the work at one
time they returned on the following day.
only to llnd that tho man had nailed up
the bars and put locks and chains on an
of the gatÂ«-s. Furthermore, one of - the
hired men told the officials that the boss,
had threatened to blow their heads oft
with a shotgun if they entered the prem
ises.
Not to be balked, the Assessor contfnued
his work, counting the cattle by means oi
field glasses from the county road. He'
figured up about 4000 head and estimated
that the stock was worth about $80,000.,
Mr. Hayes conferred with the District
Attorney of the county as to how to as
sess the property and the matter was re
ferred to Attorney General Ford. Deputy
William Abbott, who investigated the law,
gives as his opinion that where a person
refuses to make the statement to the As
sessor as provided by law It Is safer for
the Assessor to proceed under sections
3629 to 3633 of the Political Code to en
force the collection of the taxes on the
personal property against such property.
If in the opinion of the Assessor the lien
upon the real property Is Insufficient to
secure the payment of the taxes upon the
real and personal property. ,
This means that the property owner for
refusing to make a statement is liable to
bo arbitrarily assessed for anv amount
not to exceed ten times the value of the
property. -

Vroom's answer was a blow that felled

whether or not Vroom passed his nights
in his business place. Vroom's couch that

players alike were ready to become an
archists bent upon his utter destruction..
It was in the eleventh when the fierce
outbreak occurred. "The game was three
all and two Stocktonlans had gone out.
Lockhead swatted a corking fly to deep
center and Schmeer, fumbling it on a poor
return, threw to the plate. Lockhead, who
had not ceased in his course of the sacks,
was safe enough, but Donovan tumbled
out of bed and called the runner out, de
ciding that he had not touched the third
bag. Everybody who had an- eye
open saw Lockhead hit 'the sack in his
hurry-up act. Then the mix-up began.
Donovan was the - center of a howling
team. Lockhead made a pass or twoai
him, but some one intervened. For, thÂ©
time it looked like an old mob battle, but
peace was finally restored and the: game
lengthened thereby another inning. â¢Â¦;/='
The game itself was of the wild order,
full of every kind of good and bad base
ball. Whalen pitched a great [ game to
ward the end of the match, as did : Stef
fanl and^Mosklman," who was put in tha
box in the tenth inning, after Hardle re
lies ed Steffani at ; the : bat in â¢ tho lattei
part of the ninth. The score tells a funny
tale of diamond. work. . â¢
At the outset the Dudes unloaded, on
"\Vhalen and earned a run/ Two men had
been- retired when Hutchison rolled the
ball out to deep center for two * sacks/
Francks- did the same trick, making it
easy for Hutch in. his tour of the bags.

list in the third in" the. same \way. - Two
men had gone to the benches when:Ham

a double, crossing the rubber on Hutch

PRINCETON. May 12.â In the dual
track meet between the University of Cal
ifornia and Princeton teams here to-day
the Princeton team won by the score of
10 to 2 points. The results of the games
were a surprise, as it was expected that
the contest would be very close. A pre
vious comparison of the records <JT both
teams showed little difference between
the average performances of the two. It
turned out, however, that Princeton's
men were in excellent condition and put
up by far the best work they have, done
this season. The score would have beeii
r .j to three had not Woolsey stumbled
in the 220-yard hurdle within fifteen feet
of the tape. He had it. won against Hutch
ison, who got first place. . Despite the fact
that the California team waa badly de
feated every man made a plucky fight and
put forth his best efforts.
Jarvis and Krats did fine work for
Princeton in the sprints, and Captain Cre
gan surprised the spectators by finishing
the quarter-mile run in ;49 4-5 seconds,
Hutchison and Wheeler also did credit
able work in the hurdles and Perry won,
the half-mile in fast time.
" In the shot-put Woolsey and Plaw of
California had things their own way
p gainst Wright and Craig of Princeton.
Horton and Coleman of Princeton, after
tying for first place in the pole vault,
vaulted off to win the point, which was
gained by Horton on a. vault of 11 feet 1^4
inches. "This breaks the university rec
ord. Coleman then vaulted 11 feet 1%
inches, and he now holds the record. Plaw
In the hammer throw, although he won
by a throw of 1">1 feet 10 inches, once
threw 160 feet, which was not counted, as
he stepped outside tho ring.

not believe that one trip is a failure sim

In the 100-yard dash Cadogan was clearly
outclassed by Jarvls, who Is good v for
9 4-5 seconds. The 220-yard dash was a
repetition of the 100-yard, and Krata
won handily. Â¦ The 440-yard was a very
close race until the last 30 yards, when
; Cregan- pulled away from Drum and won
by 5 yards.- ... â¢ - Â¦;Â¦-Â«-.'- ,- .- . â¢_... Â¦â¢. . Â¦â¢
In the 8S0 yards and mile runf we were
easily defeated by Perry and Cregan, who
are without doubt the fastest distance
men in the world. . â¢ â¢,
Hamlin waa outclassed in the high "hur
dles, but in the low hurdles we had an
other bit of. hard luck. At the last hur
dle i Woolsey* was . ahead by three â¢ yards
and cleared the. hurdle all light, but
struck ahole and fell.. .We.won the shot
put handily, breaking the University of
California record of 41 \ feet 6 inche3.
Plaw threw the hammer In first-class
style, winning- handily. He made a. thro-w
of 1C0 feet 9 inches, but stepped out of the
ring an inch. -."' .
In -the pole vault we had some more
hard luck. Hoffman split a muscle in his
leg and waa compelled to leave the field.
Hoffman was therefore unable to com
fiete In the high jump, which went to
'rlnceton by default.
As a general summary we can say that
we were clearly outclassed. We could
not beat the "Tigers" under any condi
tions. It was an ideal day for the Cali
fornia athletes and the boys were all in
fair condition. We did have hard luck
in a few events, but if we had won these
events we would not have won the day.
Old Nassau's men are stronger athletes,
more experienced in racing and better
trained,- but I can safely say- that they
exhibit no better spirit, no more Krit nor
are they better sportsmen than the Cali
fornian athletes. > â¢ -

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 12.-For the first time
la the history of modern pugilism all
the credit ar.d glory are taken from tbÂ©
winner and given to the loser of a battle.
It is not because Jeffries fought foul in
last right's contest nor for the reason ,
that he wrested victory from the Jaws of ;
defeat that the public refuses to wreathe
his brow with laurels. It was Corbett's
marvelous defense, his fairness and gen
eral attitude before ar.d after defeat that
brought him admiration and praise with
sympathy.
In its many aspects the battle last n!ght
was the most remrj-kanle ever fought. In
its result it was remarkable for the rea
son that while the better man won the
victor vu much the worse punished of
the two. He left the rins with both of
his eyes puffed, his lips cut and bleeding,
his nose battened. Corbett showed not a
single scratch The blow that sent him
ruling into dreamland did not break the
tkin or mark the Jaw. The canvas that
covered the floor of the arena was unsul
lied by a drop of Corbett blood. At the
linish the ex-champ'.on to all outward ap
pearances was uninjured.
Two thtng-s were demonstrated by Cor
bett. The first is of little consequence to
any one but the fighter himself. It is that
he lold the truth when he said that while
using Jeffries as a training paxtner at
Carson City he was able to hit him when
tr.d where he pleased. In the Coney Island
arena Corbett at times made so bold as
to tell Jeffries just where he would land
his next blow. Tne youngster could only
grin, confident that while Corbett would
do as he said, the blow would lack force
fcufficient to do him much damage.
Resurrection of a "Has Been."
Tn another matter, however, the former
champion up*e-t all calculations. He com
t>elled experts to hastily revise their opin
ions as to the possibility of a pugilist re
turning from a condition of ftaccidity,
after years of high living, to a form that
permits him to go a distance in the ring
and g"o at a rate of speed amazing and i
accept his full share of punishment.
Every one who gives heed to professional
f port's knows the abuses that CorUett
has heaped upon his physical self since hÂ©
snatched the glory of the championship
from John L. SuHivnn. It had been said
and accepted for truth that Corbett'B con
stitution had been so undermined that he
could not withstand the severity of a
Ion? course of training.
But. although Corbett is clever, he can
not deliver a knockout blow. During his
contest he. landed scores of blows on vital j
points. Time and again he shot right
and left oa the jaw and just as often
poked one of his gloves up against the
champion's solar plexus, but he accom
plished small results.
Of the two men Jeffries to-day certain
ly looked the worse for wear. There was
a large black and blue lump over his right
eye and his upper lip was puffed and
bruised.
"Will I five him another chance?" re
peated Jeffries. "Why, certainly. I'll
fight him next week, next month or two
months from now â whenever he says the
word. Sharkey or Fitslmmons can have
a match, too, if they want it. I'll ligt.t
the sailor on the basis of 75 per cent to the
winner and 23 per cent to the loser. "With
ntzslminons I'll make different arrange
ments. I'M fight him on the basis that X
pet two-thirds of the purse money, win
or lose."
Corbett Would Fight McCoy. â¢
When af=ked about his plans for his
future Corbett Raid that he had not quite
decided. Having 1 demonstrated that he
was a long way from being a "has been"
he feels that he is in a position to make
a match with any fighter. He Intimated
that he probably would make a. match
with "Kid" McCoy if the latter defeats
Ton Snarkev in their contest before the
Seaside Sporting Club on June 25. Every
time Corbett appeared in the street he
was followed by a crowd of admirers and
cheered.
The receipts of the fight were $32,000.
Of this sum the fighters received $19,000.
JrfTric-s as thp winner receiving: $14,230 and
Cnrbott's share being J-J750. Corbett said
he thought he was entitled to one-half
the receipts and felt very much hurt that
Jf-ffries ha/1 not divided the purse with
him. Corbett has received several offers
from theatrical compar.les, but it is doubt
ful if he will accept any for the present.

J. H. Harrison's greyhound Hot. Haste
picked up the fleetest hare on the field at
Union CourFin? Park yesterday and
spoiled what seemed a rosy chance,- for
the big reserve stake. He. was drawn
against Tea Shine and led her an indefi
nite number of lengths. The hare sud
denly broke back toward the stand of
Slipper James Grace, 'where it eluded
capture for over two minutes. Tea Shine
rendered Hot Haste no assistance, the big
black and white dog doing all the work.
He should meet Thornhill In his first
course to-day and apparently has no
chance of winning. With Hot Haste out
the stake is considered to t>e between
Auckland, Overture, Thornhill, Royal
Anne, For Glory, Grafter or . Vulcan.
Overture showed to better advantage than
at any time since he arrived here.

A PRESENT TO WEAK MEM
I, Geo. S. Beck, sole oiraer of Wooder-Workers, Â«m sixty-six years old today (May 13. i9Â°o)Â»
and in honor of this anniversary I will put an extra full week's supply of Wonder-workers aa a
present into every box of this remedy sold during this week to men who mention this paper
when they order the medicine. Be certain to mention th!Â» paper wbea yon order.
An army of more than 200,000 men who were weak where pefect men are strong hatÂ« been
restored to perfect strength and manly vigor by tka nse of Wonder-Workers, and I defy any man
on earth to show that he used this wonder amone medicines "ccording to the plain Â«oa simple-
directions without being permanently cured. They do not contain Â«ny of the minerals or poisons
that make the vile nostrums sold by the frauds so dangerous, and it is perfectly safe to nse taem
under any circumstances.- Bear in mind that this greatest o! all Nerve Poods cores all weak-
nesses of men at any age, no matter what caused the weakness. Tho reason they have the largest
sale of any remedy of thei* class is because they are exactly what they pnrport to beâ the V' ora '
out Man's Best Friend, and the Greatest Remedy for Low Vitality made anywhere en earta.

TJntn Raymond. B. Peck eees the story in
ijrrlEt he will not know how close he came
to-day to being divorced from the wife
with whom ho Is a.t present living as hap
pily &.s can be. Court Commissioner Bab
cock was on ma way to Judge Ellsworth's
chamber* this afternoon to get the de
cree signed, when he met Mrs. Peck's at
torney, R. E. Hewitt, who threw up his
Lands la horror at the thought of a di
vorce.
"Way" he exclaimed, "they made up
their diftereaces a lone time ago and
ere living as happily aa two doves in a
cote."
There wu nothing further said about a
, divorce after that and thÂ» domestic rela
tion* of the Pecka will not be further dis
turbed.
Mrs. Peck, whose maiden name was Rl
varfl. sued her husband for a divorce on
April 27, 1S9S. alleging extreme cruelty.
She charged, her husband . with having
b^atea her and calling her vile names
and on one occasion attacking her with a
knife. A default was entered on the fall
! ure of Peck to file aa answer and the tes
timony in the case was heard by Court
CcmnilssloEer Baboock. As the fees were
not paid tho case was rtot reported back
Â¦ to the Superior Court and the papers lay
.In a pigeonhole until to-day. They were
brought forth when the office was under
going a general overhauling and dean
.riff and It wes decided to take them Into
court and have th-e decree signed.
It seems, however, that the couple Bet
tied the!r differences some time ago and
Â¦would have received a shock on being no
tified of the divorce if it had not been,

missioner and the attorney.
OAKLAND, May 12.â Some years ago Mrs. Rebecca C. Oleson, sister-in
law to Councilman J. G. Lemmon, was savagely attacked by a maniac
In an Eastern hospital for the Insane, of which she had been matron for
a long period. Mrs. Oleson was eo badly injured that amputation of
I members cf her hand was resorted to that her life might not have been
sacrificed. To-day the unfortunate woman was declared to-be insane and was
' committed to a State hospital. While the examining physicians are not en
1 tirely certain that the terrible experience Mrs. Oleson Buffered during her
battle with the demented creature who tried to kill her was the direct cause
, of her insanity, they did not hesitate to assert that this may have had much
Io do with her mental disturbance to-day.
Ever since the trouble during which Mrs. Oleson was bitten in the hand
â¢ by her maniacal assailant she has been slowly, exhibiting slgns^ of mental col
lapse. The wound was so severe that blood-poisoning : resulted^ For years
since then her relatives have observed that Mrs. Oleson's mind was failing.
Her condition had been attributed to this attack, as well as her association
with demented persons. While not violent in her tendencies. Mrs. Oleson gave
her carelaklns friends much worry. "She seerr.cd possessed of a melancholia
which was slowly wrecking her mind. Recently she was pent away for. a
change of a!r end scene, in the hope' that she might improve under new condi
1 tionls cf life; but this availed nothing. .
DRIVEN INSANE BY 1 -
ATTACK OF A MANIAC
I know of college classes elsewhere. But my
affection for the class will be based. upon more
than this. Whan I was a. stranger you took
me in and comforted me. To your loyal co
operation, to your cordial reception, to your
aid and encouragement In the trying times of
this first year's administration I owe more than
I can ever tell you. To your leading men and
women, your representatives through the vari
ous organizations and committees I have con
stantly looked for advice and help and I have
never been deceived or misled, but always
aided, and I have felt assured In all -the per
plexities r.z:i uricert&lntlM o/ it ntw and diffi
cult position that I could count n lth absolute
confidence upon the senior class to co-operate
with me In making things go right for the
honor and welfare of the university.
May the blesslnj of thl3 hour, this scene, this
deed go with you and abide with you and bear
la your lives its abundant fruit and Kenerous
impulses, noble devotions and Inspiring loyal
ties. -
Queer Freaks of Chemistry.
Harrold C. Bradley made the most
unique address of the pilgrimage at thÂ»
Chemistry building. He delivered a mock
address to the class upon chemistry, ac
companying It with a series of experi
ments that took the class back to some
of the exciting events that will occasion
ally happen in the best of well regulated
classrooms of chemical demonstration.
This Is what Mr. Bradley told the class to
an accompaniment of startling experi
ments:
To tear up tho rooted plant la always a hard
undertaking, and we are not the first class to
make this declaration, nor shall we be the last.
We still have the memory of the good and evil
hours through which we have passed, and for
those of us whose lot .was cast In the chem
istry building the hours have been mostly good,
filled with many and various things. Some of
you will remember when Professor Rising,
"Pop" the freshmen call him, got hold of the
wrong mortar one day in his lecture. "Pop"
was lecturing In his usual olT-hand style on
the subject of potassium. "I have here some
potassium chloride, which may be ground In a
mortar to - a fine â erâ may be pulverized In a
mortar â er â without destruction of Its charac
teristics." (Here Mr. Bradley ground something
In a mortar and there was a terrific explo
sion.) The class lost confidence In "Pop" ami
all but the young ladies went out by the back
door. .
Then we remember the day. when the co-ed
got on fire, and we took her â¢ â¢ â¢ But I can
not stop to enumerate the commonplace epi
sodes of our life here.
Loving Cup for Mrs, Hearst.
From the chemistry building the proces-
Blon moved down to East Hall- where
Mrs. Phebe Hearst was presented with a
silver loving cup. Each member, of the
class had been allowed to contribute not
more than* 25 cents, and "from this had
been mad Â»Â» the cup, which was presented
by Miss Alice Duffy, in a graceful little
address. â¢â¢Â¦There were only a few words ot
reply from Mrs. Hearst, but those words
were sincerely expressive of her apprecia
tion of the gift. Â¦
"It Is impossible to tell all that fills our
hearts, but I think that you will under
stand," said she. - Â¦ . Â¦. :Â¦ Â¦
At the mining building Rowland Oliver
spoke for "the mining push," and at the
old North Hall C. E. Miller added one
more bit of history to the first building of
the University. of California.
The Greater .University.
Through the trees : and across rustic
bridges, far up on a hillside that ; is not
often visited in the usual run of univer
sity i events, occurred the most important
ev'cnt of the dayâ the breaking of ground
for the first building of the Greater Uni
versity of . California. ,' ; It Is ; a , beautiful
hillside, with .a "wonderful sweep of
bay'andGolden Oate and the hllls:of San
Francisco and , Marln. - Down Â¦ below . are
the botanical gardens of the~ university,
bufit^is now decked with a stable of un
lovely proportions. But ; all . tills will be
cleared* away Â¦: when Â¦ the Â¦ handsome* new
residence of the president, which is to cost
Greater University of California, broke
the ground for the first of the building*
to be erected under the new plans â the
home for the president of the great edu
cational Institution of California.
The class of 1900, or as they chose to
call themselves, "naughty-naught," ap
preciated this distinction. They were
fully aware of the Importance of their
class day. They were determined that
the class day of 1900 should be remem
bered not alone as the day upon which
ground 'was broken for the Greater Uni
versity of California but also for the ex
cellence of the exercises prepared by the
senior class for that occasion. The day
was theirs by right and there was a de
termination to make It worthy of the
new spirit that has settled over Berkeley.
Two Honored Guests.
President Wheeler and Mrs. Phebe
Hearst took most Important parts In
the ceremonies of the day. It Is very sel
dom that those not actually members of
the graduating class are Introduced into
the ceremonies, but the members of the
class of 1900 wanted to show their appre
ciation of these two -workers for the
growth of their beloved university of the
blue and gold.
It was a day of color, and what the
clouded sky and hidden sun denied was
made up by the bright dresses of the co
eds and their friends, and even the usual
ly somber costume of the male animal
was enlivened by rrhlte trousers and
bright caps. Anu -when it came to the ex
travaganza In the amphitheater amid the
trees upon the hillside, it was one great
mass of tangled color from the audience
on the ground to the gayly costumed
members of the class upon the rough
wooden stage.
Even the morning exercises were made
bright by the dressing of the class. Every
blushing co-ed wore a gown of white and
every member cf the sterner sex wore
white trousers and blue coats and golf
shirtings that were glorious to behold.
Heads the Procession.
Thus the procession moved as nearly at
the appointed hour of lf> as such events
can be made to start. President Wheeler
was invited to head tho procession, which
The class of 1900 will alwara be peculiarly
dear to me. It Is my first graduating class In
the University of California. The standard by
which I ehall measure all coming classes will
bÂ« the standard of this class,- and It will be
no easy test for them If I may Judge by what
Sets a High Standard.
You love your university, but that love finds
Its consciousness not when you receive from
It, but -when you give to It. It is a benediction
upon ll'e to have learned to love a noble thing.
All that life has In It worth llvlnp for Is sum
marized In love and service, In service and
love. It is our affections that make us. and
well It Is for us when those affections fasten
themselves upon great and worthy and noble
objects, such as your college Is. You cannot

"Wheeler Addresses the Class.
At the Library building President
Wheeler delivered his address to the class
of 1900â his first graduating class since he
became president of the university. Here
Harrison 8. Robinson presented President
Wheeler with a check for 5130 to be the
nucleus of the "class of M900 library
fund," the fund to be added to and to be
used to purchase books for the "Greater
Library of the Greater Universltv of Cali
fornia," To this presentation President
Wheeler replied:
he did in his academic cap and gown.
He was Immediately preceded by a band,
and the start was made from the en
trance to the university grounds at "Dana
street. The procession moved to South
Hall, where the first speech was made
and the first good-by said. This came
from the venerable Professor Joseph Le
Conte, who Is, despite his age, still "Pro
fessor Joe" to every student in the uni
versity. The oldest member of the fac
ulty, he told of the birth of the original
University of California, as he was now
witnessing the birth of the new univer
sity. He told them of the first class of
thirty-five students and contrasted that
with the present class, and he said that
the growth of the new university would
be as great as the growth that he had
witnessed. He told them of the great
events that he had seen in the days that
had gone, and he spoke with great feel
ing and enthusiasm over the prospects
that were before the institution with
which he had been bo long connected.
slightly less than $50,000, is under con
struction. There was gathered a little
knot of students, professors, regents, of
ficers and Mrs. Hearst, who was to turn
the first spadeful of earth. There was
first an address by Archibald J. Cloud of
the graduating class, in which he said:
Mrs. Hearst's Address.
This Is hallowed ground: hallowed In days
past by the tread of men whose service to the
university has been beyond all price; hallowed
by Its associations with thla day; hallowed be
cause it Is to be the home of him and her who
have come to lead us on. On this spot meet the
two regimes â the old and the new. Associations
are many about this spot. Along this hHlwartl
path trod, day by day. the poet-professor, Ed
ward Rowland Sill. Over there. Just hid from
view, is the home in which he composed much
of his matchless verse, eo full of that color and
life which he absorbed from everything about
him. By this spot, also, many a time and oft.
passed Martin Kellogg, professor, president,
profetsor emeritus, now traveling far from
home In distant lands. While we welcome this
new era, we remember him who started the
great work of merging the old Into the new.
President Wheeler, then read the few v
marks of Mrs. Hearst, at the close of
which she turned 4he spadeful of earth
and the new era had dawned. Her ad
dress was as follows:
It Is peculiarly flttin? that the first official
act of helDinx toward the realization of our
plans for the greater university should be the
laylnsr of a foundation for a home. Around
the life of this home must gather those genuine
qualities that all will recognize who sit at Its
fireside: from it must emanate those eoodiy
sympathies that testify without words what Is
meant by the brotherhood of man; In It must
the student find Inspiration, and from It must
flow those Influences most potent in building
the spiritual university.
We who have most at heart the Interests of
the University of California have no chimerical
views In regard to the architectural plans that
have been prepared, nor do we overestimate the
larjjpr ultimate advantage far beyond the mere
material one of having In our midst an endur
ing expression of beauty and harmony. It Is
our hope that, as time brings the opportunity,
there may rise on these grounds noble bulld
lnys Ideally adapted to the needs of the ever
broadening domain of thought. Investigation
and experiment, not merely for erudition, but
for the preparation that will ennoble It and
take the Initiative in the Intellectual and moral
advance of the years to come.
Presentation of the Statue.
The presentation of Douglas Tilden's
statue. "The Football Players," was an
interesting event, although James D. Phe
lan, the donor, was absent. The statue
had been removed from the Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art. where It had been
for some time, and set up in a charming
spot at the lower end of the campus, al
most at the entrance of the cinder track.
Fred G. Dorety offered the thanks of the
class to Mayor Phelan for his gift and
James R. Whipple, captain of the football
team that finally won the trophy, spoke
for the athletic spirit of the university In
general and the class of 1900 in particular.
Then Mr. Dorety unveiled the statue and
the morning exercises were over.
The afternoon was where the class had
full sway. Then they presented their class
farce in the amphitheater amid the trees.
Lines slightly similar to other class day
farces had been followed, but the effort of
1900 is said to have been the best of a long
line of efforts. All traces of the old class
prophecy and class history had been com
pletely abandoned and a most clever ex
travaganza with a Greco-Roman smack
to it was given. It was prepared by Mis*
Alice Humphreys of San Francisco and
was full of bright bits and clever Ideas.
Clever Bit of Farce.
Miss Humphreys took the pursuit of tne
golden fleece as her foundation, and upon
that , she built a scheme of class jokea.
Tho golden fleece was the diplomas that
will be awarded next Wednesday and the
class of 1900 was represented in Jason, the
part being taken by Willsle M. Martin,
the president of the class. He Is strug
gling for the golden sheepskin, which is
denied him by "Aetes Wheeleros" and the
sacred council of professors. He deter
mines to win his ambition. Â« which la
thwarted by the recorder, who keeps It
sealed in the treasury. He Is finally given
the right to prove his title to the coveted
diploma," and calls his .witnesses.
ft is in the -dialogue between the wit
nesses and- the king and Jason that the
local hits. are made. '-21S'
The opening speech by Aetes Wheeleros
was a clever hit upon the flrat address
made by Professor Wheeler- upon his ar
rival in California, when he announced
that "it is good to be here." and for the
first time since President Wheeler arrived
at -Berkeley he found himself the butt of
student wit. All of the members of the
class/all of the fraternities and all of the
university institutions came in : for their
share of joking. One of the best hits was
when tho glee club gave its exp'anation
of why it was In debt, and told of musical
successes,' when chorus started a
few verses upon ."Fairy Tales." Those who
took part in the farce were;

Mrs. Hearst Turns
the First Sod for
the Greater Uni
versity.
THERE have been class days In
plenty at the University of Califor
nia, and many a senior class of the
days rone by has carried out its pll-
S-rlmag-e from building to building and
performed its own special exercises In
gymnasium or amphitheater, but none
have carried more important events than
the. class day of 1300. It fell to the lot of
the class of 1900 to take the first step to
ward the Greater University of Califor
nia, and the senior class that witnessed
the closing of the old century and the be
ginning of the new witnessed aJso the be
ginning of the transition of the old uni
versity and the dawning of the new. Un
der the auspices of the class of 1900, Mrs.

1US Broadway. May 12.
The board of directors of the Deaf anci
Dumb and Blind Institute at Berkeley
has outlined its defense to the fight macro
by Dr. B. P. Wall for reinstatement as
physician of the Institution. Attorneys
ReeÂ«l and JJuabatimer to-tlay filed a de
murrer to Dr. Wall's complaint. Whi'a
Dr. Wall asserts that he was Illegally
ousted from the position, the directors C+
clare that they have ample warrant unoor
the legislative enactments covertnu their
powers to remove the attending: physician
at will. After Dr. Wall's removal Dr. O.
D. Hamlln was appointed his successor.
Dr. Wall retired perforce, but very socn
after he ivaa removed he began the suit
for reinstatement which Is now before the
courts. The controversy has created muort
interest in medical circles as well a*
among politicians, as the final decision
will have considerable bearing upon the
rights of directors of State institutions to
control the personnel of the employes un
der their administrations and for whose
conduct they are responsible. From the
law side of the case the conflict Is simply
upon a plain construction of the statutes
covering: the administration of tho institu
tion. The demurrer will be up for hearing
a week from Monday.

sion the hall, under the eupervision
of the decoration committee, of which
M. Joseph Savage was the chairman, was
beautified in a manner that it never had
Veen before. The ' prevailing color was
that of the chapter, a deep red, and the
Illumination was rose colored. The monot
ony of red was relieved by a profuse dis
tribution of ferns and palms, the whole
having the appearance of a fairy scene
sometimes setn on the stage. The vesti
bule leading to the main hall was also a
fine bit of decoration. It was In the chape
of an arbor In red. white and blue and
roses, producing a most striking effect.
The literary and musical part of the en
tertainment was all that good taste could
supfrest, while the supper served during
Intermission in dancing was excellent.
Ad.ied to the feast was a
mental one, consisting of an address of
â¢welcome by High Priest Harry Baehr and
responses to toast* by Samuel M. Bhort
ridpo, Charles H. Murphy and Franklin
H. I>a.y. The success of the affair was
due to the efforts of the committee of ar
rangements, consisting of Harry Baehr,
Robert N. Carson and Charles Bone, with
John Bennett as master of ceremonies.
Dancing was resumed after supper.
On the night of the SOth inst. Islam Tem

OIL A GOOD INVESTMENT.
Under present economic conditions, money Is
essential for freedom. Every man or woman,
who has surplus earnings, wishes to Increase
that amount, so that, not only will they have
some laid by for a "rainy day," and "old age,"
but, also, that they may be free from drudgery,
be able to cultivate the mind, have a home,
educate their children, and travel. Money made
In oil Is free from any curse, or "hoodoo"; It
goes further, and lasts longer, because It is not
made out of the toll, sweat, aches, Â¦ pains and
blood of under-fed. Ill-clothed, and poorly-paid
laboring people; but it comes from the sale of
that liquid mineral produced from the bounti-
ful bosom of Mother Earth, which contains
riches in unlimited abundance for all her chil-
dren. Dividends are the only thing worth goiug
after In the oil business. Be euro to Invest your
money In those companies which have only ab-
solutely "sure shot," proven oll-beaiing lands.
Then with wise, conservative and honest man-
agement you are sure to get a handsome re-
turn on the money you paid for stock.
Tha Juanlta Oil Company Is selling stock
(non-asBeeeable) at ONE CENT PER SHARE
for the purpose of developing Its known oil
lands. Send $1 and get 100 shares; more money,
more stock. Bend 2-cent stamp for new circu-
lar. Call on or address JUANITA OIL COM-
PANY, 175 N. Sprang St.. Los Angeles, Cal.
TO INVESTORSâ We have the sale of a limited
amount (20,000 shares) In a local oil company,
property and management flrst claas, which

Investigated the property and believe It to be
the best purchase on the market at the pres-
ent time. You will make no mistake buying

Condition of the Treasury.
NEW YORK, May 12.-The New York Finan
cier says this week: After a continuous expan
sion in loans, which lasted over six weeks
and added forty-eight millions to the totals
of the New York bank! 1 , the clearing-house In
stitutions reported May 12 a decrease of J2S7.9O0
in the loan item. The decrease Is of small
moment, but it is interesting at this time as
showing the culmination of operations which
have been a constant factor In the weekly re
ports for a considerable period. The assertion
has been made that the New York banks are
carrying sterling to the amount of $40,000,000.
This plainly interpreted means that they are
not loaning that amount to Europ<*. While
there is no means of 'verifying th<Â» statement,
there is no question that the rise In loans has
been due more or less to that cause. At any
rate, now that actual exports of gold are be
ing made, it Is not to be expected that the
banks will add to outstanding commitments.
It had been expected that the fourteeen-mllllon
loan of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
would Influence the current statement, but there
Is authority for saying that this transaction
was completed too late to enter the statement
calculation and besides that quite a large per
centage went to trust companies and Philadel
phia Institutions. . The caah changes In . the
statement are immature. The banks'- loss to
to-day on account of gold exports and interior
gains did not offset these decreases. The re
sult was a reduction of $$77,000 In cash holdings.
This was not evently distributed, as one bank
alone reported an increase of four millions -In
specie. The changes In loans and cash account
for the. decrease of $1,909,000 In deposits, the
first shrinkage noted since "March 24, after a
steady rise amounted to $67,000,000. The sur
plus reserve for the week was reduced $645,750
and now stands at $15,332,725. -Taken as a
whole the statement is better than had bfen ex
pected.: The chief Interest for the week or two
centers in the volume of possible gold exports.
Already the movements amount to o\'er $6,000,
000. The gold has gone to France and if Eng
land does not demand remittances the ship
ments may. be" lesa than now indicated. It is
worthy of note that time loans are now being
engaged to run over the Presidential election,
the impression being that the money rates will
harden considerably - later on. In 1896 money
during the latter part of the Presidential con
test: loaned at 100 per cent -and above.
New York still continues to be the cheapest
money center in the world.

THE STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, May 12.â The tone of the trad-
Ing In stocks was feverish and uncertain to
day and the diepoRltion to sell was still evi
dent. There was an effort to support some
stocks and the ehort selling by the bears was
followed by buying to cover contracts. Mis
souri Pacific was lifted at one time a point
above last night, earning the railroad list
with It. The grangers, especially Burlington
and Southern Railway preferred, were pretty
well supported after the rally in Continental
Tobacco preferred from Its 6U point slump.
This stock recovered almost completely btfore
| the close. Stocks were offered freely at thÂ«
; higher level of prices and declined to the
lowest before the appearance of the bank state
ment. People's Gas, the local tractions and
the steel -stocks were all notably weak and
large losses were registered In a number of
shares which have not been traded in during
the recent declines. Some effort was made to
rally prices after the bank statement because
It failed to show the expected heavy expansion
In loans, .but It was successful only In Iso
lated Instances. The close generally was un
steady and net changes were mixed. The
weekly reports of the mercantile agencies con
firmed the feeling that the business reaction
has not yet reached its limits and the opinions
expressed In the Senate yesterday of the pÂ°s-
Elbillty of foreign complications on account of
the Monroe doctrine as applied to the Danish
Â¦West Indies, was cited by the bears as further
ground for speculative depression. The re
port of a small decrease in the loan account
of the banks for the week Instead of a heavy
Increase was a surprise to Wall street. It
did not alter the belief in the reported loan
to the Pennsylvania, which is to-day reported
to be from fifteen to twenty million dollars.
The placing of such a loan late in the week
would figure In the bank statement for the
averages of only one day. The calling of loans
earlier In the week In preparation for the new
accommodation would figure disproportionately
! in the averages. The eftect would be to throw
the showing in the statement of the next week.
The clearinge statement* are lower than they
were a week ago after a week of great lrregu
larity and uncertainty In movement. For two
days the market looked as though general
liquidation had set In, but the quick recovery
on Wednesday afternoon waa the result of a
movement to cover by the bears who had
been selling short but who became alarmed
at the cessation of the pressure to liquidate.
The liquidation, in fact, seemed to be com
pleted for the time being and its limited ex
tent gave color to the supposition that It had
been due to the selling out of a pool whose
members had grown tired of their non-success
in getting prices up. The strong and skillful
manipulation with which the market was sus
tained while the liquidation was being effected
shows that the sellers had large resources and
a wide-reaching concert of action. The mar
ket rallied considerably from the low point
1 on the demand to cover bear contracts and
efforts were made by bull pools to extend the
advance, but the general demand for stocks
; continued extremely apathetic and the market
fell back into dullness and renewed weakness.
Wall street wants to know how much further
the decline in prices of commodities must go
before renewed consumption will be Invited in
sufficient volume to absorb production. Upon
the answer to this question depends future
profits for industrial enterprises as well as
earnings by railroads. So far as events of
the week have furnished any light on the
problem they indicate . that the readjustment
of prices Is not yet complete. The 'present
ease of money Is regarded in an unfavorable
light as a reflection of the diminished trade
In the interior, but It affords means for meet-
Ing the present special demand for gold from
Europe. On the other hand should trade re
vive in the interior with the lower price of
commodities and the money market become
more active any stringency on foreign markets
might become embarrassing. The volume of i
American credits now placed In foreign loam
makes the home money market more than ever j
sensitive to the course of foreign markets. I
The etatements for the past week of the great j
Government banks abroad show that money |
conditions there are easier for the time being ;
in spite of the stronger position of these in
stitutions.
Bonds reacted in sympathy with stocks and
subsequently Fhowed some recovery.
United States refunding 2s, when issued, the
2s and old 4s declined V4 and the new is U
in the bid price. .

CHICAGO, May 12.â The corn liquidation was
the feature on 'Change. Trade began with
the market steady, but It speedily turned
weak. The weather favorable for planting, the
proved inability of the remaining bulls In the
market to hold In the face of. the poor ex
port inquiry and change of general speculative
sentiment encouraged more short selling, which
in turn caused liquidation. Following .. the
opening the long stuff came out. In heavy lots
and the pit was very animated. July closed
at 37Vic, a loss of M-C.
The wheat market opened steady because
cables were less weak than had been ex
pected in view of the decline here the previous
session. The corn weakness soon made itself
felt, however. Predictions of .. rain in the
Northwest were also an* influence In I the sell-
Ing as that section of the wheat-growing
country has been clamoring for, moisture for
some time. Shorts covered on the decline and
as prices had declined rather tempting to
buyers the market rallied and cloned with
the early loss nearly all recovered, July closing
at 65%c.
Oats were easy In sympathy with corn. July
closed Vic lower. Â¦ . '
Provisions were quiet and firm, but without
any notable incident to the trade. The trading
was slow and generally unimportant, although
the cash demand was fair, easily equal to the
supply. HogR were firm and receipts were very
moderate. July pork closed 5c higher, lard
2VfJT5c hlsrhei' and ribs a shade higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Karla" played the second p!ano part of
the Chopin Romance, from the E minor
Concerto, the ensemble of which was de
lightfully good. She also played as encore
to the Romance Durand's Valse in A flat.
Miss Paloma must look to her laurels, for
she will have a worthy rival in her slster
pupll. The audience would have had yet
another encore for this charming little
lady, but had to content itself with load
ing her with flowers. Paloma's Improvisa
tions were remarkable, as usual, and here
in she shows remarkable genius most un
mistakably. It is entirely evident. Indeed
that nothing- Is wanting to make even
great artists of these children- but study
under competent teachers.
An extra recital Is announced for next
