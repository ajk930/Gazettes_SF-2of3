LADY SOMERVILLE THE
BRIDE OF EARL RUSSELL
Both Secured Divorces in Genoa, Nevada,
the Same Day in Order That They
Might Become Man and Wife.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, April IH.-Earl Russell and Mollie Cook, or Bomerville. were mar
ried In Reno last Saturday. Tr.-day the fact came out that they both se
cured divorces in G<Â»noa last Saturday. It appears that the two were de
sirous of becoming man and wife, but a little obstacle in the way of an
rxistins: husband and wife stood ir. their way. and it was necessary for
them to live In the county s:x months before they could gain a residence and
petition for a dissolution Â«>f the bonds formerly contracted.
The records In Genoa show that Karl Russell was married in England some
ren years ajro, nmJ that a fov.- months after his wife deported htm. The divorce
was granted. Lady Somerville's oompiair.t contained the following allegations:
That she was married to Genrge John S-.merville at Aberdeen. Scotland, on the
twenty-third day of July, I\S?, and that she has been a true and faithful wife

Th^rrfor; that since the marriage her husband has wrongfully and unjustly,
and without any cause, continually 111-treated, neglected and abused her minor

departed fcr England the pair.? day and wore married in Reno. They probably

VEILED IN MYSTERY
ACCUSED OF MURDER
OF DANIEL H. WILSON
. J. Owens Arrested in Yoh County and
Charged With a Crime That Shocked
Suisun Valley in 1896.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN, April 19.â Sheriff George H. Savage arrived from Mad
ison, Yolo County, late this evening, having in charge a man
named T. J. Owens, -whom the officer firmly believes is the mur
derer of Daniel H. Wilson, the Suisun Valley crchardist, who was as
sassinated at the door of his home on the night of October 9, 1896. Ths
arrest was made on the ranch of J. B. Jones, near Madison, at 1:30
o'clock to-day, Sheriff Frank P. Grace of Sonoma County and District
Attorney F. R. Devlin of Solano County being with Sheriff Savage at
the time and accompanying him by team to the jail here. The accused
man is a resident of Healdsburg and had bsen in Yolo County but a few
days. He is the husband of Mrs. Lucy Owens, who was housekeeper for
Wil%m at the time he was murdered.
Sheriff Grace furnished the information that led up to the arrest,
and although the officers would not give out any of the facts this even
ing they admitted that they have evidence in their possession that will
convict Owens. They volunteered the information that on the morning
of October 8, 1896, Owens left his home in Healdsburg driving a horse
and cart, and did not return until late on the night of October 10. He
carried with him a double-barreled, muzzls-ioading shotgun of No. 10
bore. The officers have the gun in their possession and Owens admits its
ownership. Wilson was killed with hand-mada buckshot, and Owens
owned a bullet mold that molded the same size bullets a3 wars found
in Wilson's body. The officers al3o said that Owens had made some
damaging admissions sines his arrest. A few days after the killing of
Wilson, Mrs. Wilson, her sister and two brothers-in-law were placed
under arrest, but were discharged at the preliminary examination. In
January, 1899, Mrs. Addie Wilson, wifs of the murdered man, her
mother, Mrs. E. Dickinson, and the latter's son, W. J. Miller, were
arrested and charged with the crime. They, too, were discharged at
the preliminary examination. Sheriff Savage and District Attorney Dev
lin feel confident that the mystery surrounding the murder of Daniel H.
Wilson will soon be cleared up and the assassin brought to justice.
Murder of Daniel H. Wilson.
The arrest of Owens is the third act in
one of the darkest tragedies ever enacted
in the history of Solano County, when
Daniel H. Wilson, an aged rancher, was
shot dead on the threshold of his own
door, on the night of October 0, ISOG, by
an unknown assassin.
After over two years of patient investi
gation one W. J. Miller of Vallejo, a
brother-in-law of the murdered man's di
vorced wife, toward whom suspicion
strongly pointed, was arrested on Janu
ary 11. 1830. and formally charged with
the crime, but a judicial Investigation se
cured his discharge. The officers did not
quit the hunt, but began to follow a trail
leading in another direction and are now
sure that they have caught th^ .guilty
man. The suspicions, which caused the
arrest of W. J. Miller and the pertinency
of the arrest of Owens, at this time, to
ward solving the mystery of the murder
will be better understood from the follow
ing details of the facts of the case, which
were given exclusively in The Call of
January 11 of last year:
Daniel H. Wilson was a rough, ignorant
old man. who lived on his farm and fruit
ranch, five miles out from Suisun. In
ISO 3 he and his wife separated after a
quarrel and later were divorced. ThÂ»
community property was divided, the old
man retaining his ralch, and the wife
went to live with her mother, Mr 3. E. G.
Dickinson, and 11. W. McEwen. on the
latter's ranch, not far from the Wilson
place.
They had two children, and by agree
ment one of them, a boy, remained with
the father and the other, a girl, went with
the mother.
Motives for the Crime.
After his wife left him. Wilson employed
a "housekeeper" to look after his domes
tic affairs, or, rather, a series of them, for
not one seemed to enjoy the situation
enough or to suit his fancy well enotish
to rercaln for any great length of time.
On? of the first of the. series of "house
keepers" was a Mrs. Virgle O'Brien, for
whom Wilson seems to have entertained
a strong liking. She left him after a
time, against his desire, and hrr place was
filled hy a Mrs. Lucy Owens (the same
name as that of the man ju.st arrested),
who was with him at the time of hia
death. Mrs. Owens kept with her dur-

Fair Grounds and Enjoy
Their Holiday.
Â£pecial cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright. WOO, by the Herald Pub
lifehinc Company.
; PARIS, April 20.â 1t was Children's day
at the Exposition yesterday. Thursday
Is the day in Paris on which the schools
.have a holiday and the result was that
thousands of families poured into the
grounds. The general character of the
exhibition, however, showed little or no
change. The grounds were invaded by
thousands of workmen, and nothing was
heard but the sounds of hammers and
saws. Electric lighting apparatus is go
fng up everywhere, and in a few days'
time i'Esplanade dcs Invaiides, le Champ
de Mars and 1_ Rue dcs Nations will be
thoroughly well illuminated.
The greatest amount of progress has
been made in the foreign pavilions. That
of Russia is ready, and that of Roumania
will open its doors within another twenty
four hours. The United States will re
quire about another week to complete,
and England will only be about twenty
four hours behind.
The second ofliclal inauguration took
place yesterday. The llrst was that of
the Russian pavilion and the second was
the opening of an exhibition in the hor
ticultural sections. It was carried out by
M. Millerand. Minister of Commerce, and
C. J- Dean. Minister of Agriculture. They
were received on their arrival at 10 o'clock
in the morning by M. Picard, M. Gauthier,
architect of the monumental conserva
tories building. In which the exhibition Is
held, and the members of the jury. After
the Ministers had inspected the exhibition,
the jury commenced their duties. A mag
nificent exhibition, from the Crimea, by
the Imperial Horticultural Society of Rus
sia, was greatly admired.
Dispatches from Copenhagen state that
the Crown Prince and Princess have de
cided to pay a visit to the Exposition.
Telegrams to the French press from
Rome also announce that the Prince of
the royal family, perhaps, and even the
Crown Prince, will pay an official visit to
Paris in July or August next.
Work Is being pushed rapidly at the
Chateau d'Eau, or the water palace,
which will play a great role among the
attractions of the Exposition, especially
when the fetes de nult are given.

PAULIST PRIESTS COMMENT
UPON REPORTED DECREE
Do Not Believe the Pope Has Issued
an Chrder Referring to Politics .
of Catholic Orders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 19.â Rev. Father
Elliott, provincial of the Order of Paulists
of the United States, was asked to-day
concerning the reported decree of the
Pope that "hereafter no religious congre
gation will be permitted to take any part
in politics." This decision is binding
upon Catholics all over the world, includ
ing American Paulists and others. R&v.
Father Elliott said:
"I have received no notice or Informa
tion and I think the report must be an
error. Some have attacked the Paulists
before this, but I cannot understand what
possible grounds they can have for mak
ing such a petition. 1 cannot recall- a
single instance when a Paullst priest in
any manner figured in politics. We are
missionaries and do not seek to make
Presidents, but make Christians."
The pastor of one of the largest congre
gations In Washington said:
"This report has created much Indigna
tion among the priests of this city and.it
is the general belief that It originated
among the enemies of the Paullst Fath
ers."

ITALY MUCH INTERESTED
IN CROTON DAM RIOTS
Embossador Baron Fava Requests
the State Department to Ade
quately Protect Aliens.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 19.â Italy Is very
much concerned over the Croton dam
riots. Baron Fava, Italian Embassador,
requested the State Department several
days ago that adequate protection be af
forded Italian subjects and their interests
at Croton Landing. The State Depart
ment transmitted his communication to
Governor Roosevelt, 'asking him to take
further action. An official of the depart
ment said the general Government could
not Interfere with occurrences taking
place wit hJn the boundaries of a sovereign
State, provided there was no Interference
with Federal business. The department
Is satisfied that the presence' of troopi
will show that the Government Is dojns
all in Its power to protect' aliens. '
Ing her stay at the Wilson ranch Mrs.
Ada Rice, her niece, and her brother, John
Hanchard, was at times a visitor at the
place, being often seen loafing and idling
around
Wilson had never ceased his efforts to
have Mrs. Virgie O'Brien return to him
as "housekeeper," and a short time be
fore his death he had succeeded In get
ting her promise to do so. The induce
ment was that he would deed to her the
ranch his sole remaining property. The
announcement of his intentions was made
some days before to Mrs. Owens and the
other inmates, and on October 10 the
change of "housekeepers" was to be
made. Mrs. Owens was to be superseded
by Mrs O'Brien. The news of the change>
and the proposed disposition of his prop
erty was carried by their son to his
mother at the McEwen ranch, and cre
ated great consternation, as she had
hoped that the property would fall to her
son on the death of the father, and again
be a home for herself and children. These
people and one, W. J. Miller, a brother of
Mrs. Wilson, living in Vallejo. were all
that v.-^re known to be connected wltn
the affair.
Story of the Killing.
On the morning of October 9 old man
Wilson went to Sulsun to collect the
money for his almond crop, which had
been shipped and sold, returning about
7 p. m. He had paid off and discharged
his three hands, parting with them on the
best of terms, and was alone on the ranch
with Mrs. Owens and her niece, Mrs.
Rice. After eating his dinner he sat
down to make up his accounts for the
season and the two women retired to their
apartments to spend their last night in
the house. All was quiet, when suddenly
something struck the door with a dull
sound. Wilson started up. but soon re
sumed his work. The sound was repeated,
and soon after Mrs. Owens, scantily at
tired came down from her room and went
toward the door. She remarked that she
was going after some water and that
some mischief maker must be at his
pranks. Wilson replied that if any more
clods were thrown his answer would ba
with a shotgun. He offered to get tho
water, but Mrs. Owens said no. and. open
ing the door, disappeared In the darkness.
A moment later Wilson followed her. as
she swore, without her knowledge. She
got the" water, returned to the house and
closed the door. A moment later she
heard Wlison say, "Don't lock me out,
Lucy." She opened the door, and as the
light fell upon the old man as he stood
before it there was the flash and report
of a gun from the darkness, and Wilson
fell forward dead across his own thresh
old, shot through the breast. The alarn.
was spread, and within an hour neigh
bors had gathered, and when daylight
came careful investigation of the grounds
was made for tracep of the assassin.
Tracks were found In the soft ground of
the orchard, but lost at the bridge on Its
edee, where he had mounted a horse and
ridden away. The Coroner's Inquest
brought out many facts, but not so con
nected as to form a chain of material evi
dence.
Mrs. Owens and her brother. John
Hanchard, were arrested on suspicion,
but soon after discharged for lack of
evidence. Mrs. Wilson, the divorced wife
of the murdered man, with her brother,
W. J. Miller, her mother. Mrs. Dickinson,
and McEwen were all under suspicion for
the time, but for want of tangible proof
the officers did not feel justified In mak
lne a formal charge and were at a stand
still. Thpn Governor Budd offered a re
ward of 5300, to which the Sheriff of So
lano County added $200 and quiet de
tective work was begun In earnest by a
number of persons. The caÂ«e sepmed
Fhroudfd In mystery, however, and the
numerous clews led to nothing until Jan
uary 11, I*o9. when W. J. Miller, the
brother of MrÂ«. Wilson, was 'arrested at
Vallcio as the murderer.. The following
day Mrs. Wilson and her mother were
also arrestf d an accomplices. A motive
was .found In thedeslre to prevent thÂ«
diversion of the old man's property from
his children and a strong caÃe of clrÂ«
cumPtantlal evidence was made against
thÂ« accused. In the examining trial be

Accordlng to diplomats In Washingtoi,
who are acquainted with official sentiment
In Turkey, Minister Straus" declaration
this morning respecting the failure of the
Sultan to keep his promise In the matter
of the settlement of Turkish claims will
undoubtedly make him persona non grata
to the sublime Porte.
All Ferrouh Bey, Turkish ' Minister to
the United States, will not discuss this de
velopment of the diplomatic tangle be
tween the two countries, but he is In
dignant that any reflection should be cast
upon the word of his sovereign.
"I was very much surprised," he said,
"to read the declaration made by Minister
Straus that the Sultan had promised to
pay claims and had failed to do so. The
Sultan entertained a high regard for Mr.
Straus and the latter had many other
friends in the empire. Mr. Straus Is still
the representative of the United States
accredited to the sublime Porte. How can
he be justllied In making such a public
declaration when he Is acting in a diplo
matic capacity? Tt Is a violation of inÂ«
ternatlonal law. I cannot perniit any one
to impugn the word of my sovereign. You
may be sure that if the Sultan had given
his promise to pay the claims they would

BOOK PUBLISHING TRUST
MAY SOON BE FORMED
Rumors That Efforts Are Being Made
to Combine the Harpers and
Appletons.
' NEW YORK. April 19.â The Evening:
Post to-day says: Inquiry was made to
day concerning a report that the publish
ing houses of Harper & Bros, and D. A.
Appleton & Co., both of which lately fail
ed, might be combined under one man
agement. It was said that G. B. M. Har
vey, now the financial head cf the Harp
ers, would become the head of the reor
ganized Appletons. It was further said
that this move would be the first step
toward the formation of'a book publish
ing trust, that within a few months all
the large concerns would be united, to de
crease the cost of production and do away
altogether with competition In the repro
duction of European successes. Such a
trust could dictate terms to news com
panics and the reputable retail firms. Mr.
Harvey has been In Europe for six weeks,
but is expected back the first week In
May.
One of his representatives In the Harp
ers establishment said the idea of a union
between that house and the Appleton
house was "all in the air." There had
not been any conference on the subject
between any representatives of the two
concerns. It was true, however, that such
a project had been talked about In the
book-publishing circles, and more espe
cially In Wall street. There had been
similar Indeflninte talk of forming a great
book trust. Shortly before Mr. Harper
went to Europe he was approached by
representatives of an Important publish
ing house in this city, not the Appletons,
with a view to an amalgamation of that
concern with the Harpers. This was
practically a matter of an indefinite prop
osition to sell out, but nothing was set
tled about it one way or the other.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 20.â The
Republican convention, which met to-day,
resulted in the predicted Bplit and two
delegations will be sent to the national
convention. There were stormy scenes at
the Capitol prior to the meeting of the
convention and the result was the serious
wounding of Gaston Scott, a young white
man, by.Grantc L. Moragne of Gadsden,
who bad been chosen sergeant-at-arms of
the convention by the executive commit
tee.
The contending factions, having failed
to agree upon a chairman, the State Com
mittee, by a vote of 17 to 10, decided to
name the temporary officers of the con
vention and to prepare a temporary roll
of the delegates. Upon this action being
taken, State Chairman Vaughan and nine
others left the committee meeting and se
cured possession of the hall of the House
of Representatives, where the convention
was called to meet.
The majority of the committee, after
naming their temporary officers, attempt
ed to capture the hall. In the struggle at
the door Maragne, .who had* been named
for aergeant-at-arms oy the committee,
drew a revolver and fired three shots at
Gaston Scott, two of them taking effect.
Moragne ran Into the Governor's office,
pursued by a brother of Scott, who fired
two shots down the corridor of the State
House.
In the Governor's office both Maragne
and Scott were disarmed, and then Gov
ernor Johnston closed the State House
against both facttons.
On Cflng expelled from the Capitol, the
anti-Vaughan faction organized. The
credentials committee reported 2">9 dele
gates present out of a total of 332.
M. De Wlckersham, District attorney;

Cooper of Marion and J. C. Leftwlch (col

Bacon of Georgia inquired whether
"United States army officials were in re

Foraker replied that the army officers
were prohibited by law from accepting
such additional pay.
Bacon said, wnile he had no definite in

Chandler thought Mr. Bacon's state

the better. And the sooner we adjourn

CANNON WOULD
CALL A HALT TO
ADMIRAL DEWEY
Says Naval Officers Are In
competent to Perform
Civil Duties.
Remarks Called Out Before the
House in a Debate Over Certain
Terms of the Naval
Bill. ;
WASHINGTON, April 19.â The House
spent practically the entire day debating
a proposition in the naval "bill designed to
turn over to the navy the survey and
charting of the waters of Cuba, Porto
Rico and the Philippines. The bill carried
an appropriation of $100,000 for this pur
pose. Cannon, chairman of the Appro
priations Committee, led the fight against
It, arguing that such surveying of these
waters as should be made should be per
formed by the coast and geodetic survey,
which, he said, could work cheaper and
better. In the end the House adopted an
amendment offered by him to appropriate
only the regular $10,000 for ocean surveys.
The chairman of the committee of the
whole, Payne, overruled the point of or
der against the appropriation for the
naval academy, but an amendment of
fered by Cannon was adopted providing
that before the money appropriated by
the bill for the academy be expended
plans for the whole Improvement, not to
exceed $6,000,000, be submitted and ap
proved by the Secretary of the Navy.
Cummings of New York argued that the
proposed surveys should be made by the
navy, not by a semi-political bureau like
the Coast and Geodetic Survey. He poked
fun at the superintendent of the survey,
who. he said, flew his own flag while
afloat liko a flag officer of the navy. He
read a letter from a man now in the sur
vey who had served twenty years at sea.
The letter described the work as "pie."
"Nobody knows anything but me," It
said. "I am commanding officer. I was
only a boatswain in the navy."
Cannon concluded the debate in favor
of the amendment. The officers of the
navy were educated to tight, he said, not
to perform civil duties.
"In the performance of civil duties," he
said, with great emphasis, "they are the
most incompetent and the most expen
sive."
In the burst of applause that followed
this utterance some one cried out some
thing about "Dewey."
"Oh, I am not talking politics." re
sponded Cannon. "I am talking dollars
and cents, and an efficient survey. I am
a great admirer of Admiral Dewey and all
the other officers and men who served in
the Spanish war. I love them so well that
when 1 see men trying to set them to
work at something at which they cannot
sustain 'themselves I call a halt."

ALLEGE RATE
DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST DENVER
Merchants of That City Ap
pear Before Interstate
Commission.
Expert of the Chamber of Commerce
Presents Table of Figures Show
ing Favoritism to Omaha
and Kansas City.
DENVER, April 19.â At the meeting of
the Interstate Commerce Commission to
day all the railroads entering Denver
were represented by attorneys and offi
cials and a large number of the memberb
of the Chamber of Commerce, which Is
urging- the complaints, were present. Some
of the members of the chamber were
called to testify. The evidence to-day
was mostly in regard to alleged discrim
ination against Denver shippers In favor
of concerns in the East.
James E. Murden, a freight-rate expert,
in the employ of the Chamber of Com
merce, offered figures and tables to prove
what ho asserted was favoritism to ship
pers in Kansas City and Omaha.
Alfred S. Proctor, a dealer and manu
facturer of ore bags, testilied that ho
could not manufacture bags in Denver
and compote with St. Louis because the
rate from St. Louis to Denver on the
finished product was only 68 cents,
whereas the material used In making the
bags cost $1 02 laid down in Denver.
Joseph Zelgmond, a picture-frame mak
er, said he could. buy frames In New York
and ship them to Denver, cheaper than hÂ«
could bring the material.
George J. Kindel, the original complain
ant, said the conditions were unchanged
from 1895, when the case was first heard
by the commission.
W. N. Byers, for a number of years
president of the Chamber of Commerce
declared that the railroads were the cause
of Denver losing a number of manu
facturing industries,, which would have
come here had not Denver been handi
capped by unfair freight rates discrimina
tion. Ho asserted that at least one-fourth
cf the business men in Denver at present
were greatly dissatisfied with conditions
L. M. Bogue, a manufacturer of mixed
metals, said he could buy in St. Louis
mixed metal cheaper than he could make
it here .
,W. C. Jackson, a manufacturer of rock
drills, said he would like to open a fac
tory here because of. the field, but tho
New York article sells for less money In
Denver than he could duplicate it for.
The defense will not offer any testi
mony.
The "commission â¢ adjourned until 10
o'clock to-morrow.
CHILEAN PLOT
TO ASSASSINATE
TWO AMERICANS
Had Visited the Country to
Extradite a Defaulting
Banker^
State Department Has the Matter in
Hand and Diplomatic Relations
May Be Broken Off Very
Soon.
> -
E&Â«clal IXepatch to ThÂ» Call.
BOSTON. April 19.â An attempt by of
ficials of the Chilean Government to as
sassinate two Boston police officers
figures in the unsuccessful effort of the
Boston police to secure the extradition of
Fred \V. Moore, a Boston banker, who is
charged with having embezzled $500,000
from a Boston bank and is now at the
Chilean capital. Inspectors A. J. Hough
ton and J. M. Harrison of the Boston
police, who went to Santiago de Chile
under the authority of the State De
partment to bring Moore back to Boston
for trial, returned yesterday without him.
They are absolutely reticent about their
experiences in Chile in response to In
structions from Washington. It is
stated, however, by a member of the
police department that the two Boston
officers received scant courtesy at the
hands of the Chilean officials and that
three men in Chilean uniforms made a
deliberate attempt upon the life of In
spector Houghton. The two officers were
in Eecret consultation with United States
Commissioner Fiske to-day. No Inkling
of their disclosures to' the commissioner
was tfven out, but that they were of a
serious nature is inferred from the fact
that a special messenger was rushed to
Washington late this afternoon with the
commissioner's Information. Both officers
are under the strictest injunction from
their chief, acting at the Instance of the
Federal authorities, not to discuss the
case for the newspapers until the State
Department has had an opportunity to
act. It is stated that the matter is so
serious that the friendly relations be
tween the United States and Chile are In
volved.
A friend of Inspector Houghton and a
prominent member of the Boston Police
Department thus summarized the matter
to-day: "You may be assured that the
State Department will take the most en
ergetic action when the real facts of the
case, are known. These facts are such
that a rupture between the United States
and Chile is imminent."
The business interests of Boston are
determined to secure the extradition of
Moore at any cost.
WILL CARRY FOOD
TO STRICKEN INDIA
Secretary "Long Gives Orders to Close
the Option on a Suitable
Vessel.
WASHINGTON*, April 19.â The Navy
Department has secured a 5000-ton steam
er to carry the wheat and other food .sup
plies collected by charitable organizations
In New York to the plague and famine
eufferers in India. Secretary Long was
informed by telegraph to-day by Pay Di
rector Dennistcn that he had found a
suitable vessel, and he replied as follows:
"Close option at the lump Fum of $40,000
If the Christian Herald approves, subject
to inspection under the commandant of
the New York navy-yard, with whom I
Â¦will communicate. Department trusts
donors will now fill the vessel to her full
capacity. LONG."
The laft sentence was added because
the stores collected at New York,
amounting to &Â»o ton?, are not sufficient
to exhaust the capacity of the ship.

RIVERSIDE. April 19. â Vern^a Shearas,

SACRAMENTO. April 19.â The May
Queen contest has reached the ex
citing stape. The carnival commit
tee this afternoon announced that
no new candidates m;iy entt-r and
i that there will be no further counting of
| votes until Saturday nipht. when the final
! canvass of the ballots will be made and
i the successful candidate named.
i When to-day's balloting was announced
' Mrs. H. G. Smith was in the lead and her
friends assert that she will surely be
elated. The vote to-day stood:
Mrs. H. G. Smith 5700. Miss May Jlc-
Adams 5715, Miss Rebecca Elliott 333 G.
MJss Millie Metlar 1237.
The votes represent the value of a
nickel each and they are being deposited
In solid blocks for the favorites. The
other day one batch of 2000 ballots was de
posited for Mrs. H. G. Smith and it is
faid that her friends have even larger
blocks in store to be voted before the con
test closes Saturday night. Although It
Is said that friends of Miss Metlar have
several thousand votes ready to cast in
her favor, the general belief is that the
GOVERNORS OF
WESTERN STATES
TAKE ACTION
Oppose the Leasing of
Public Arid Lands by
the Government.
In Favor of the Cession of Such Do
main to the Several States
Wherein They May Be
Situated.
>
SALT LAKE, April 19.â Governor Lee
of South Dakota and Governor Poynter
arrived to-day and took part in the pro
ceedings of the Governors of Western
States, who have met to discuss subjects
of Interest to this section.
After a general discussion the commit
tee appointed to formulate resolutions
against the leasing of public arid lands
by the General Government and demand-
Ing the cession of such lands to the sev
eral States, should any change in the
present system be made, reported the fol
lowing, which were adopted:
Resolved, That the people of the States here
represented are opposed absolutely to any leX-
Isiatton or any action of any kind looking to
or having: for Its object the leasing of the
public arid lands of the United States by the
general Government or, any agency thereof.
Resolved, second. That the present laws pro
viding for the control, management and dis
posal of the public arid lands of the United
States are best adapted to the needs and re
quirements of the country and conducive to
the settlement and occupancy thereof by bona
fide settlers.
Resolved, third. That If It shall be found
that the present laws affecting the arid lands
are not satisfactory â¢to the Congress of the
United States then we favor a cession of the
said arid lands to the several States wherein
they are situated under such terms and con
ditions as will guarantee the benefits of the
free homestead laws to the people of the
United States and that will prevent said lands
either by fee simple^ title or by the leasing
thereof from passing Into the possession or
control of large companies, syndicates, corpor
ations or wealthy Individuals in large quan
tities to the exclusion of others and under such
conditions that the several States may have
the Income arising from said lands to be de
voted to the reclamation and Improvement
thereof for settlement by, bona flde citizens.
Governor Lee of South Dakota was the
only one who opposed the resolution. Ills
opposition was simply because he believed
that the demand for cession to the States
should be put first.
A form of letters to be sent out to other
Governors was adopted.
Burial of Mis. Glascock.

WOODLAND. April 19â Mrs Elizabeth
Glascock, mother of ex-Senator Glascock
and Mrs. Jackson Hatch of San Jose, died
In Washington on the 10th lnst. and was

Virginia and 82 years of age. For tho

eral Lawton and his staff.
When Lawton fell Howard's plans were
made known and hla claims to distinction
were rewarded, for, while the nation
mourned, this renegade was Invested with
a uniform by General del Pilar and ap
pointed a major of artillery, subject to
the approval of Agulnaldo, when he could
be reached. Howard sports his sword,
and is. now considered .one of the greatest
strategists of the Filipino army.
Records of the First California, taken
when the regiment left here, show no
Hamilton Howard in the ranks. It la
possible that such a man Joined the com
mand out in the Islands, or Just before
the regiment left home, but he Is not a
local man and no one in the regiment
has any recollection of a soldier of that
name. His name has been* mentioned in
dispatches as having deserted the United
States forces to take service in the Insur
gent army, but he has never been men
tioned except as a man utterly worthless
as a soldier and dissipated and Immoral
as a man.

advices to-day received from "Wen

court, a new version Is furnished of
the death of Major General H. W. Law
ton. McLaughlin, who la well known here
and who reported the special proceedings
at Sacramento last winter, confirms the
story that Is credited with truth In Ma
nila. This new account traces the tragic
end of . Lawton to Hamilton Howard, a
renegade and deserter from the First Cali
fornia Regiment, who planned the ambus
cade, and upon good authority he' is cred
ited with having fired the fatal shot.
Howard, it appears, deserted his com
mand at Cavlte during the early days of
the Spanish war. His reception among
the insurgents was not flattering, owing
to his dissolute habits, and he became the
butt of ridicule. Jests and pranks, includ
ing the painting of his body with colors
while he lay In a -stupor. When a party
of Pllar's forces occupied San Mateo and
General Lawton made his night march to
reach it orders were given to retreat. At
this Juncture Howard, who had become
a camp vagabond, after an interview with
Pilar, was placed in charge of the detach

American advance. They were instructed
to kin Lawton and with this desire they

SANTA BARBARA. April 19.â The sec
ond polo game of the series was played
to-day between Riverside and the local

Riverside winning by a score of 14 to 2.
C. E. Maud of Riverside played the
star game of the season, making seven
goals and assisting materially in three
more. Redington and Ealand distinguish
ed themselves with the home team and
at each game they are improving greatly.
Peter Martin of San Francisco played
with the Santa Barbara team and made
both the goals that were secured on their
side. There will be some very interest-
Ing pony races Saturday afternoon, but
there will be no more pqlo until Monday,
when Burlirigame and Riverside will con

DOGS ARE READY FOR
THE SHOW'S OPENING
Only three days more In which to enter
dogs for the forthcoming show. The of
tice of the San Francisco Kennel Club
at 23S Montgomery street is open every
day until 9 p. m. and will be open on Sun
day. It is not advisable, however, to wait
until the last moment to enter your dog,
as the rush .will be so great that it will
be difficult to give exhibitors proper at
tention. The entry promises to largely
exceed that of last year. St. Bernards
will probably number over a hundred, fox
terriers and bull-terriers about fifty each
and cocker spaniels about seventy-five.
The kennels of cockers will be interest
ing, as the competition is of the keenest.
W. C. Ralston will show his peerless
Champion Flavia, Mrs. Cluness will ex
hibit Ralllette and E. C. Plume's Orno
Girl will take the place of Hcrry Cprlton's
Oakslde Trilby, now out of condition. In
dogs Mr. Ralston's Hamilton Jack, E. C.
Plume's Champion Viscount and 11. E.
Wegener's Champion Havoc will prob
ably be the ones left in the fight for the
winner's prize. Billy Quinn has a field
spaniel in the list and Billy Kittle will
find in him a strong rival to Tony, while
Dave Hogan will not by any means
have the expected walk-over. -

Judge Murasky Declines to
Enjoin the Chief of
Police.
Columbia Athletic Club Officials An
nounce That They Will Test the
Case and Hold Fights Next
Friday.
Â»
Judge Frank J. Murasky refereed the
bout between Chief of Police Sullivan and
the directors of the Columbia Athletic
Club yesterday afternoon. After listen
ing to a long argument between District
Attorney Byington. his assistant, Mr.
Graney, and Supervisor Reed on the side
of the peace officials and Attorney Collins
for the club he denied the application for
a writ enjoining the Chief of Police from
interfering with the boxing bouts ar
ranged by the club to take place last
night.
The matter had bejen taken' to the courts
because Chief Sullivan had declared his
Intention of stopping the bouts unless the
club officials secured the necessary per
mit from the Supervisors. This the latter
would not grant, as they had decided to
permit but one professional fight each
month, and the National Athletic Club
had secured a sanction for the present
month. The Columbia Club's attorney
advised its officers that their rights undei
the $1000 license, which they had taken out
under the State law, could not be abridged
by any ordinance passed "by the Super
visors of this city and county. This
sounded good and might be true, but they
did not hold their exhibition last night,
nevertheless. â¢
The decision of Judge Muraskv was not
rendered until nearly 7 p. m. Chief Sul
livan then asked Manager Crowley if he
intended to endeavor to carry out his
programme of boxing. The latter replied
in the negative, saying the suit wae a
friendly one, bronsrht to; determine if pos
sible the rights or the club in the prem
ises and that ho would declare off the
show. Later in the evening Mr. Crowley
announced his determination to hold tho
lights one we-ok from to-night. This is
the date named by the National Club foi
the meeting cf Al Nelll and Tim Murphy,
the Australian boxer.
The Columbia Club officials do not hesi
tate to express the opinion that the Na
tional Club people were at the bottom ot
their undoing and they threaten retalia
tion.
Captain of Police Gillln was at Wood
ward's Pavilion last night with a squad
of patrolmen, but their services were not
required. The doors of the pavilion were
not opened. A small placard was posted
on one of the doors, reading "Show post.,
poned because of order of court." Thero
was never any crowd about, as the few
men who alighted from the cars moved
away upon learning the state of affairs.
Commandery is chairman of the general
committee that will look after the wel
fare of the visitors. The pilgrimage will
start from this city Monday afternoon.

TO CONCEAL CRIME
Â» â .
DETECTIVE ED GIBSON is search

wanted for chopping one of his
countrymen named T. Takahashi
about the head with a hatchet some days
ago in a lodging house at BIOV2A Stockton
street. Takahashl is still under the care
of physicians and it is feared that he will
The action of the injured man's friends
in concealing the crime from the officer*
for some time is responsible for the cul
prit's escape. They called the police ear
ly Monday morning and told that the as
sault had been committed about 9 o'clock
the previous evening, and stated that they
intended keeping the matter a secret, but
when they came to the conclusion that
the victim would die they thought it besi
to bring the case under the official eye.
When the surgeon nt the Receiving Hos
pital examined the wounds it was found
that the Japanese had again misrepre
sented matters, as the wounds had been
Inflicted at least three days before, in
stead of a few hours, as the witnesses
claimed.
The injuries received by Takahashl are
â¢likely to prove fatal because of the lack
of medical treatment he received after
the wounds were inflicted by Kuroyamagi.
The wounded man and his countrymen
are loth to give any reason for the ter
rible blows. From what could be gleaned,
both men are rivals for the hand of a
pretty geisha girl, who bestowed her
f.miles on both with equal warmth. Last
Hunday night Kuroyamagi called on his
lady love and. on finding his rival there,
became insanely jealous, and picking up

PLAN TO INSURE
COMPETITION IN
CITY LIGHTING
Municipal Ownership of
Poles and Wires Is
the Solution.
Supervisor Reed Will Urge Accept
ance of a Proposal of the Inde
pendent Electric Light and
Power Company.
At a meeting of the Committee' on Pub
lic Utilities of the Hoard of Supervisors,
held yesterday afternoon, Supervisor Reed
presented a unique and interesting prop
osition, which may develop into the city's
ownership of electric poles and wires and
make competition In electric lighting per
fectly practicable. In discussing the mat
ter Supervisor Reed declared that he was
authorized to announce that Claus Spreck
cls will erect the necessary poles and
string the required wires to furnish elec
tric lights to the entire city for a sum
to be ttxed Dy A. M. Hunt, general man
ager of the Independent Electric Light
and Power Company.
Supervisor Reed, acting upon a sugges
tion from John D. Spreckels, had inter
viewed Mr. Hunt and was told by him
that the work, roughly estimated, would
cost aDout $242,500. Kecd declared that the
proposition is- an exceptionally good one.
in it he sees the practical solution of
monopoly in electric lighting and the be
ginning of actual competition. If the
city owns its own poles and wires it
achieves a tremendous independence over
any corporation which may hold a mon
opoly. By owning us own poles and wires
the city can have the advantage of bids
tor lighting from companies wnich could
not compete if they were forced to under
go the tremendous expense of erecting
poles and wires. ,â¢
Reed suggested such an ownership as
a measure well designed to destroy mon
opoly and he declared yesterday that he
will urge its adoption and all that Is
necessary to make it operative upon the
board. He stated further that he believed
mat the Independent Electric Light and
Power Company can do the work for a
sum at least $50,000 less than the city can
do it itself and he will urge that provi
sion be made in the next tax levy for
$*uO,OOO with which to complete the under
taking, , Claus Spreckels having agreed to
do the work and accept payment out of
the next tax levy.
Â¦This proposition, which throws the elec
tric* llgnt proolem into a reasonable solu
tion of competition, has suggested anoth
er, which probably will also receive at
tention. It is the municipal, ownership of
water mains. Such an ownership would
Invite bids for the sale of water to every
one who had power to bring water to the
city. Within the city all competitors
would be on an equality and a tremen
dous advantage would be won for con
sumers.

later three relaUvt-s of Kreling appeared,
intending to secure the watch. Charles
Kreling, the nephew of the deceased, was
subsequently sent for by Captain Sey
mour, and after closely examining the
watch he positively identified it as the
jiropertji of Kreling. He had seen it a
number of times in the possession of the
<;ld man and could not be mistaken in
his identification. A jeweK-r named Mus
gravÂ«\ who has a store la the Mission,
al*Â«o recognized the time-piece as the prop
erty of Krelmg. He had repaired it on
September 'Si last at the direction of Krol
ing. The latter informed the jeweler that
lie had bought the watch from a friend
who was in nard luck and seemed to prize
it very highly.
The fact tnat the watch was pawned
right days after the body of Kreling was
lound leads the police to believe that he
had either unconsciously left tho time
piece behind him when he disappeared cr
intrusted it to the care of Mrs. Juhn Krel
ing. It is known that Mrs. Kreling gave
the watch to the Market-street saloon
keeper to pawn, as she claimed she was
linancialiy embarrassed and needed the
money. The saloon-keeper, not wanting
to be known in the matter, sent young
Donnelly to the pawnshop, where he sold
the watch for about one-third its value.
Tho money derived from the v.atch was
turned over to Jlrs. Kreling.
Captain Seymour last night endeavored
tn see Mrs. Kreling. but she could not be
found. There are several discrepancies in
her story relative to how she became pos
sessed of the watch that he is anxious
to have her fxp^ain.
BANK COMMISSIONERS
EXPOSE A BIG FRAUD
D. H. Jones of the Guaranty Loan
and Trust Company Proven a
Wily Schemer.
'D. H. Jones, the head of the Guaranty
Loan and Trust Company, has been heard
from again. Some time ago the Bank
Commissioners of California addressed a
letter to Jones asking: him whether he
was complying with the laws of this
State, as he advertised to have a house
or agency in this city as the headquarters
of the enterprise. To this letter Jones re
plied that he was complying with the
banking laws of New York, and that the
Bank Comptroller of New York had rated
the Guaranty Loan and Trust Company
highly. A letter has Just been received
by the Bank Commissioners from the Su
perintendent of Banks in New York State
in which the statement is made that there
iss no officer in that State known as the
Bank Comptroller. "The Superintendent
of the Banks of the State of New York,"
so the letter reads, "has not examined
the Guaranty Loan and Trust Company
and it Tiolds no license from me to do
business in this State under the banking
law. Whatever business it may have done
in this State has been conducted in such
a manner that it has not previously been
called to my attention."

FRANCHISE FOR
VALLEY ROAD IS
IN GREAT FAVOR
Supervisors' Committee Is
Inclined to Grant Its
Petition.
Application of Bay and Coast Rail
way May Be Denied as the
Concern Exists Only on
Paper.
9
The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday practically decided to recommend
that the application of the Valley road for
a franchise along Illinois street for a
double-track steam railway be granted.
Attorney C. P. Preston, Chief Engineer
Storey and Vice Preseident Payson of the
San Joaquin branch of the Santa Fe sys
tem addressed the committee and re
quested that the application be allowed,
as a transcontinental line was involved in
the project and the interests of the com
munity were vitally affected. It was in
tended, he said, to ultimately connect
with the main line. Attorney Preston
stated that the franchise could not be sold
by the city, as the charter provision ap
plied only to streetcar lines. Franchises
for steam railways were governed by the
provisions of the code, one of which was
that the life of such franchises shall be
fifty years.
The committee postponed final action for
one week to get legal advice as to its
powers.
The Bay and Coast road did not fare so
well in its application for a franchise to
enter the city at Twenty-fourth street.
Attorney Baggett and J. B. Cronan ap
peared for the road, but the committee
appeared to think that there was not suf
ficient evidence of the existence of the
concern and that it appeared to exist on
paper only.
'"What evidence are you prepared to
give," inquired Supervisor Curtis, "that
your scheme is bona fide?"
Baggett replied that the company did
not desire to give out too much informa
tion, as the other roads might take advan
tage of it. He stated that any other guar
antee of good faith the board might desire
would be gladly furnished. ' He denied
that the Southern Pn citic Company was
behind the scheme. The matter was then
laid over for further investigation.
Dr. Dorothea Moore, president of the
California Club, addressed the committee
on the protest against the destruction of
Telegraph Hill, and the matter was re
ferred to the Board of Public Works.
Chief of Police Sullivan asked that ac
tion be taken In the matter of removing
obstructions from the sidewalks. He
stated that he had instructed his men to
remove poles, awnings, etc., and desired
information regarding special permits
granted by vie board. Chairman Maguire
said that the subieet would be finally dis
posed of at next Monday's meeting.
DEATH CLOSES CAREER
OF ANOTHER PIONEER
JOHN BARTON, a pioneer of '43. and j
a business man who did much ;
toward the development of the Pa- j
citic Ccast. died yesterday after- j
noon in the apartments at th<Â» Palace Ho- !
tel which he has occupied with his fam- j
ily for several years. He was SC years '
old. For several years Mr. Barton had j
been suffering from a chronic complaint, ;
R-hlch finally resulted in blood-poisoning. !
He v..is taken seriously ill three days aso !
and was attended by Dr. Boynton. His j
< :.<j v.as peaceful. Mrs. Barton survives |
her husband, also a son. William F. Bar- j
ton. and a daughter. Miss Grace Thnmp- i
son }:::rton. who is now In Paris. There !
are also two surviving brothers of the !
deceased residing here, Hcrace W. ana j
]{. V. Barton.
J. ;.:i Barton was perhaps best known ;
bere p.s the president of the Union Pa- j
elite Salt Company, of which, he was the i
founder. He was born at Leicester, j
Mn.-s.. Scptrirber 13. ISI3, and came of i
Revolutionary stock. Coming to Califor- |
r.ia in I>W in search of gold, he soon saw
that the easier way to fortune was In I
trading, and a few months later opened '
Lan auction and commission business in.
Sacramento, where he remained for many
years.
He was the pioneer salt manufacturer
on the Pacilic Coast. He entered upo:.
the business in a small way in I*6S, but it
\\as not until two years later that he or
ganized the big corporation, of which he
was still president at the time of his
death.
Aside from the Fait business Mr. Bar
ton Invested capital in many enterprises
that helped build up the city and the
coast. He secured the original franchise
for the Sutur-=treet railroad, and was one
of the founders of the Fireman's Fund
Insurance Company, of which he was a
director and member of the finance com
mittee for many years. He was the first
depositor in the Pather Bank, now known
as the San Francisco National Bank, and
always a stanch supporter of that insti
tution. HÂ«* was (jlso a director in the
Commercial Insurance Company and for
years hÂ» id the same position In'the Union
Insurance Company.
In politics Mr. ilarton was a stanch Re
publican and always took a prominent
part in all movements that were for
the reform of municipal affairs. He was
an honored and highly respected citizen
and his death will he considered a great
loss to the community.

THE MORMON INCREASE.
THE clergy of other denominations have recently
on several occasions girded severely at Mor
nionism. The secular student of history ami
affairs always shrinks from an attack upon any form
of the religious idea, for such attack invariably is fol
lowed by the accession of converts to the idea that is
assailed. The annual conference of the Mormon
church, recently held at Salt Lake, reported the pas'.
twelve months to be the banner year in the history
of the church. Its membership increased 20 per
cent. It extended its influence and its increase in
numbers over Utah. Idaho and Wyoming. Such
marked progress, closely following the rigid enforce
ment of the anti-polygamy laws and the escheating
of its secular property to the Federal treasury, stands
in evidence of the value to the leaders of a religious
cult of any policy that can be construed into perse
cution. Of course the Mormon leaders will deny that
the progress of their church is due to such purely
material influences, and will claim that it is a mani
festation of that supernatural favor of which they
claim to have been the beneficiaries ever since their
settlement in the wilderness of the Utah basin.
Still, from the clear-eyed secular view, it may, be
claimed that the otUcr sects make a mistake in dwell
ing too much upon their notion of Mormon imper
fections and too little upon the merits of their own
belief.
In these days a church makes but little headway by
devoting its time to telling how bad others are rather
than in proving how good it is. The Mormon church
is. in its essence, the greatest co-operative institution
the world has ever seen. It can drop polygamy and
flourish, as long as it adheres to the principle of co
operation, about which so little is known or said by
the outside world.
The success of every Mormon settlement in the
ir.tc4--mountain region is due to intelligent direction
of the settlers in the materialities which furnish their
daily bread. They are not permitted to make mistakes
in the character and fruitfulncss of the land they take,
nnd do not lack intelligent direction in its tillage.
They have but one responsibility, and that is the obli
gation to work. Industry, directed by experience,
has produced a general condition of prosperity and
comfort, and these, with a large percentage of man
kind, make easy the acceptance of any sort of politi
cal or religious vagary. We by no means intend to
characterize the Mormon idea as a vagary, for that
would be injustice to the attitude of several hundred
thousand intelligent Americans who have found re
ligious peace in its acceptance. Still, its success is
The steamship China brought 137 coolies to this
port. The Doric had 132 on board, and now the Xip
pon Maru is in the harbor with 266 more of "mer
chants, students, tourists and native sons." If this
procession keeps up Collector of the Port Jackson
will soon have enough with which to open a new par
lor of native sons.
The express companies have won a victory worse
than defeat in the decision of the United States Su
preme Court that patrons of the monopolies must pay
the war tax. The people do not readily forget or for
give robbery, even if it is official.

CHINESE BUREAU RECORDS
ON" the last three steamers from China arriving
a! this port within a period of twenty days
there were ,535 Chinese. On the China there
ucrc 137. of whom 49 claimed to be natives of this
country. The Doric brought 200, out of which num
l.cr 132 were consigned So this port for admission.
41 of them claiming to be natives. .On the Nippon
Mam, now in port, there are 266.
What disposition has been made of these Chi- j
icsc? How many have been admitted as merchants? j
iiow many as natives of the United States? In these j
questions all Califomians arc interested, for the mat- j
Ut is one of sr-'ve concern to all. Xo answer, how- j
ever, is to be given. Collector Jackson, who but a j
short time ego announced a willingness to have the i
records inspected, copied and published for the infor
mation of the public, and who did, in fact, permit The
Call to obtain the figures which reveal the extent of
Chinese immigration during the last three years, has
now received a new light. He declares that when he I
permitted The Call to have access to the records he
violated orders of the department, and that hereafter
he will be more dutiful in that respect.
The order upon which the Collector relies for
authority to refuse to make public the extent of Chi
nese immigration runs thus: "To Collectors and
other officers of the customs: The department finds I
it necessary to invite your attention to article 1166 of
the customs regulations of 1892 (section 12.498), and
especially to the portions in relation to inspection of
public records and documents, or information ob
tained therefrom, shall not be made or given except â¢
by or to a person or persons interested therein or
entitled to such privilege. A strict compliance with
the foregoing is enjoined (Signed), O. L. Spaulding,
Assistant Secretary." "â
The order is not grammatical, nor lucid, but ap
pears designed to prevent the private business of im
porters, contained in the records of the Custom
house, from being exposed to examination by rivals
in business, or by any one not concerned in it. Such
a ru!e is undoubtedly right, but it seems a strainc.l
construction to hold that the order denies the right of
the people to have information of matters which are
of a public nature and which do not relate to private
business. At any rate the language of the order con
fers upon the Collector the authority to determine
who are. and who are not interested in ftie records or
entitled to the privilege of inspecting them. It is
upon him. therefore, the responsibility for the refusal
The people of California are undoubtedly inter
ested in Chinese immigration. They are undoubtedly
interested in the manner in which the exclusion act
is being enforced or evaded. To them the records of
the Chinese bureau are matters of public concern,
nnd when they or their representatives of the press !
ask for information they are entitled to the privilege
of inspecting the records and learning the full truth !
of the operations of the bureau. !
It is h:ird!y to be doubted that Collector Jackso-i !
received his new light on the subject and discovered
that he had violated orders in permitting The Call to
inspect the records only after he became aware of the
fact that the records are not creditable to his adminis
tration. Faced with the proof of the enormous irnnii
pmtioii of Chinese, and of the large proportion of the
immigrants admitted as natives and therefore citizens
of the United States, and confronted by the resulting
Â«li play of popular condemnation, he now seeks to
li! "c from further exposure. The people of Califor
nin rire riot to 'enow how many of recent importations
of Chinese have been admitted. That is the situation.

OVERDOING THE SCHOOLS.
r\ MONG the bills recently introduced into' Con
/ \ gress is one by Representative Marsh of Il
linois designed to extend military instruction
to the public schools of the country. It has been fa
vorably acted upon by the Committee on Military
Affairs and may possibly be brought before the House
at this session.
The bill provides that whereas the national defense
must depend upon the volunteer service of the peo
ple of the several States, and whereas those
cities and towns which shall adopt a system
of military instruction in their public schools
are entitled to the assistance of the Govern
ment, therefore the President may assign re
tired officers and non-commissioned officers, ser
geants, corporals, etc., "in the public schools of the
various cities of the United States where such instruc
tion shall have been authorized by the educational
authorities thereof, and where the services of such in
structors shall have. been applied for by said authori
ties." It is further provided that the city or town au
thorities shall pay the cost of commutation, of quar
ters and the extra duty pay of the officer so assigned,,
and that the Secretary of War shall issue ordnance
stores to the public schools of any city or the nor
mal schools of any State which shall adopt military
instruction as a part of its public school system.
On the face of it the bill seems eminently com
mendable. It appears to fill something like a long
felt want. There is undoubtedly a general yearning
for military instruction, and it may be one of the
things we need most in our national life. Beneath
the surface, however, there are many objectionable
features in the measure. In the first place it would be
difficult to give in the public schools any military in
struction that would be of value in time of war either
to the country or to the pupil. In the second place
the adoption of such an act would tend to start a
rivalry among cities to have as much as possible of
the new instruction, and schools that need all the
money they can get to carry on the present courses of
instruction would be. tempted to make expenditures
for military tuition. Finally the children of our pub
lic schools are already overworked, their attention is
scattered over too many different subjects, and they
have now mbre studies than they can carry on with
any profit to themselves or to the community.
There are limits to the mental and physical powers
of school children, but that fact. appears to be over
looked. Efforts are being made to teach in the pub
lic schools every kind of knowledge and skill. Of
course all knowledge is good. It would be very ex
cellent if during their schooldays our boys and girls
could be taught everything about everything, and
trained in morals, manners, industries, trades, lan
guages, music, art, gymnastics, golf and the art of
war. If a child's mind never flagged, if he could keep
at school twenty-four hours a day, and if his child
hood continued for about fifty years, it might be pos
sible to teach all s.uch things with success. Time and
human nature being what they are, however, there
must be some things left for people to undertake after
they leave school.
At this very time, while this Congressman from
Illinois is seeking to impose a new and additional
training and burUen upon the schools, there is a wail
coming up from Chicago because the pupils in the
schools there are not taught enough of grammar to
write the language with a fair degree of accuracy, nor
enough of any of the elementary branches of learning
to have the basis of an education. A" multitude of
fads or fancy studies take up the time and the ener
gies of the children, and they fail to acquire correct
ness in anything.
Much the same complaint can be heard in all
American cities. The public schools are being over
loaded with studies all along the line. Military in
struction may be a very good thing, but so is indus
trial instruction, and until we have taught the" arts of
peace in the schools it is not worth while to venture
upon the arts of war.
MR. CLEVELAND'S LETTER.
THE activity of the anti-Bryan element in the
Democratic party is not confined to those who
followed the National Democratic Convention
of Indianapolis. It is found among those who sup
ported Mr. Bryan in 1896 on the score of regularity.
Both classes were represented at the dinner of the
Brooklyn Democratic Club. Mr. Cleveland's letter
clearly indicates that his position is unchanged, and
that he stands where he was four years ago, and pre
fers the defeat of Bryanism, which he regards as
I Democratic only in name. He says: "There has
never been a time when false leadership of our party
and a departure from simple Democratic faith have
I not been quickly discovered and ruthlessly rebuked by
! listless support, pronounced defection and bitter de
1 feat." .
Put against this Altgeld's declaration in his Albany
speech, and you have the great gulf that divides the
Democracy of the country. The ex-Governor said:
"In 18S4 nnd in 1802 we won. not by reason of any
thing we stood for, but simply because the Republi-
I cans themselves were weary of their leaders. But we
i stood for nothing, and were despised. We turned our
backs on Jefferson and went chasing after the swamp
I lights of Hamilton, and men arose in their disgust
I and spat on us. The universal verdict of the Democ
i racy is that our national triumph in 1884 and 1892
: was a misfortune for both the country and the party,
and I believe that a majority of the Democrats of
America would rather be defeated for all time than to
have another triumph of that character."
Mr. Cleveland in his letter refers with severity to
the Bryan-Altgeld Democracy as "a party of oppor
tunity, with sails spread for every transient breeze of
popular sentiment or excitement," and that "the
henlthfulness of the party may well be questioned
when it shrinks from such an examination of its po
sition as will enable it to avoid disaster," and that if
those who claim to be the followers of Jefferson "in
this time of doubt and temptation neglect such ex
amination, these conditions should not continue with
out a brave and early Democratic protest."
It would seem that the leaders of the two wings
have thus served notice upon each other and that
neither will surrender. A very significant interpre
tation of Mr. Cleveland's letter was given at the
Brooklyn dinner in the speech of ex-Governor Camp
bell of Ohio, a supporter of Bryan in 1596. who said:
"The party of Jefferson cannot survive half Demo
cratic and half Populistic, but must repudiate the
socialistic theories brought into it by the Populists.
The 16 to 1 theory is dead, and as long as the Demo
crats proclaim their intention to resurrect it their own
resurrection will be postponed." He also reminded
the company that "the army of voters have plenty
of work at good wages, and it will be hard to enlist
their co-operation to destroy oppression in Porto
Rico or stay imperialism in the Philippines unless
we first abandon the menace to thfir own prosperity."
Against this is Altgeld's declaration: "Bryan is an
idol, not a hero. I hear some men say, 'Why could
not Bryan consent to modify some features of the
Chicago platform so that we could unite and then
win?' The moment Mr. Bryan consents to modify
the Chicago platform in any particular, that moment
he is destroyed."
There you have it. The position is more irrecon
cilable than' in 1596. The party is to remain semi-
Populistic; is to go to the cemetery as a body
snatcher to resurrect a dead issue, and stay dead it
self. It is to remain a menace to the prosperity of the
great army of voters, and be "ruthlessly rebuked by
listless support, pronounced defection and bitter de
feat."
Mr. Cleveland won fairly his title of prophet in
American politics, 2nd the country is glad to agree
wiih him in this latest expression. There is but a
single drawback in the matter, and that is that he is
betting on a certainty.
greatly due to the shrewd paternalism so wisely put
in action by as intelligent a company -of leaders of
men as have been on the earth since the Hebrew na
tion flourished and expanded, largely by the same
policy. Fortunately for them their church is safe
from schism as long as its people are held together by
external attacks. When these cease, the individuality,
which no religious fervor can banish from mankind,
will be asserted, and the Mormon church will decline
from internal causes, as is the habit of all organiza
tions.
PASTORS DIFFER
FROM PARKHURST
Would Not Revise the Present
Presbyterian Confession
Its Doctrines, They Say, Are the Same Now as
Ever, and They Cannot and Should
Rev. Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst of New York, not being
j[ entirely satisfied with the Westminster Confession of Faith,
has declared that in his opinion it should be renczved, remod
eled and revised. . Â¦
He says: y "We want a new creed. Amending this one
will not meet the necessities of the case." He advocates a creed
simple and concise, and, the inference is, omitting much that is in the
present confession. He believes the creed should be brought up to
date, as he says "it is surprising that the Presbyterian church is able
to do as much as it is doing with such an incubus strapped upon us
as we are tottering under in our present confession."
The sentiments of Dr. Parkhurst are not the sentiments of the
Presbyterian ministers of this city nor of the State, for those here
keep in touch with the church, throughout the the entire coast. It is
the opinion of some of the leading Presbyterian ministers here that
the confession cannot well be revised. That it was framed nearly
three centuries ago and zvas a reflex of the times they do not deny,
but they say the principles annunciated then have not changed, nor
are they any the less in harmony with these days than they zuere
zvith those.
Follozving are four 'interviews that shozv the sentiment of the
body of the Presbyterian church in San Francisco, and probably
upon the coast:
REVEREND JOHN HEMP- '
HILL, pastor of Calvary
Church:
They cannot revise the confes- .
slon of faith. It has stood too .
long and too much to be changed .
now. Twelve years ago, at . the -
Saratoga Assembly, it was decided -
to revise the confession, and the "
leading men of the church were *
given the work. The revision was .
submitted at a subsequent assem- -
bly and it was rejected. It was -
found when the diction of the "
nineteenth century was placed be- -
side that of the seventeenth cen
tury that both were spoiled. The \
new was not so good as the old, .
and this was recognized at once. .
I am sure nothing will come from .
this demand for a revision. There .
are some points about, the confes
sion which are hard for some peo
ple to understand, but It is only i
the officers of the church that are
required to subscribe to it, and for
them It should be something more
than a few simple doctrines simply
set forth. They need a confession
of faith that deals with details;
that covers minute points of doc- â¢
trine and that is comprehensive. :
The one we have covers everything .
and it covers everything minutely. .
It will not be revised.
REVEREND W. E. DUGAN.
pastor of the Memorial
Church: *
There seems to be a tendency in
the East to revise creeds and con
fessions of faith, but the same de
sire does not seem to exist here.
It might not be a bad plan to have
a "working creed" for the use of
the church members, the laity, but
we should not think of doing away
with the old confession for the
ministry. Times haj.e changed
since the Westminster Assembly
and the application of the doc
trines annunciated have changed,
but the doctrines themselves have
not. For instance, at the time the
confession of faith was adopted
the doctrine of predestination was
emphasized and wa3 made the
theme of most of the sermons.
Now we seldom preach of it. In
former times the various doctrines
of the confession were taken up
in the pulpit and sermons were
built upon them; now we use them
in our sermons as principles, but
we do not take them as subjects.
Then the favorite topic was the
Justice and vengeance of the Lord:
now It is his Infinite love and
mercy. So it is with the confes
sion. The doctrine of predestina
tion is emphasized: that of God's
love is subordinated. The only re
vision possible is to change this
form. The principles cannot be
changed.

REVEREND H. H. BELL, pas
tor First United Church:
We have no criticism to
make of the confession of faith In
this church, and we would not see
It changed. Dr. Parkhurst has been
quite on the liberal side of things
for a long time, and It Is quite pos
sible that there are many things
about the confession of faith that
he has never fully accepted, and
from the report of his words it is
hard to say just how far he would
go in his revision. The confession
in some ways is not up to modern
conditions, but I would not change
its sentiments nor its substance.
I accept God as it has given him to
me, and as I know him I give him
to the world. I have seen no de
sire to have the confession revised,
nor do I believe there exists such
a desire to any great extent, at
least out here. The confession as
we have It has stood a long time,
and It has not been found wanting.
It has been found equal to all de
mands so far made upon It, and
just as it is I believe It will do very
well. It might be modernized in
one or two ways to suit modern
conditions, but the revision Is not
necessary, and I do not think It Is
generally desired.
REVEREND EBER G. MA
THENA. pastor Olivet
Church:
I can sec no desire on the part of
the Presbyterians here to change
the confession of faith in any way.
It has served every purpose, and
any attempt to change it would
arouse a great deal of opposition.
Among the ministers of the Pres
byterian churches In this State I
have heard no criticism of the con
fession of faith. This may be at- '
tributed to the proximity of our
San Francisco Theological Semin
ary at San Anselmo. There the
teaching must adhere absolutely to
the confession, but It Is harder to
here are loyal to it. The effect of
this loyalty Is naturally noticeable
on the congregations. It Is easy
to criticize such an Instrument as
the confession, but It Is harder to
get another to put in its place. It
is made up of principles, and these
cannot be revised. There are those
in the church who would not for
sake the old beliefs. It would be
interesting to know just what point
in the confession Dr. Parkhurst
would revise. He says the whole
thing needs revision, but he says
nothing of any special point or doc
trine, nor does he offer anything
as a substitute. I think the con
fession is good enough as it is.

STRIKE OF ITALIAN LABORERS
From L'ltalia.
Apropos of the strike of the Italian la
borers at Croton Dam the San Francisco
Chronicle publishes a leader wherein it
critizes very bitterly the action of the
Italian worklngmen who struc* because
the contractors they worked for reftowl
to raise the wages from $1 2o to 51 w a
day. As the telegrams have reported it
seems that In order to prevent disorders
among the strikers a company of tne
militia from Mount Vernon, State or >ew
York, was called out. and unfortunately
one of the soldiers killed by an unknown
party, probably one of the strlKera.
No civilized and wise Person would ap
prove this kind of killing of a soWler
who is summoned to the discharge of his
duty. We all agree to this point, but tne
Chronicle, which once more has been in
spired by its ungenerous and stupid hate
against the Italian people, in commenting
on the fact which we ourselves condemn
throws low insults and outrages against
the Italian laborers in general. It .pnnu
that they are not good citizens; that they
are not worth more than $I 'i> a day, that
they Introduce into this country the prac
tice of assassination and defy the consti
tuted authorities in their efforts to main
tain peace, and finally states that its sym
pathy is with the soldiers. Ama ~
It is bad enough for a respectable Amer
ican paper to taKe the; part of contractors
against honest wor kinsmen, no matter
what may be their nationality, especially
when these strike for a most legitimate
and reasonable motive, as it seems is the
case with the Italian laborers of Croton
Landing; but even admitting that the lav
ter are wrong in their action, this is not
a good reason why a wholesale condem
nation should be cast upon a nationality
whose people, among tneir faults, have
shown themselves to be very good citi
zens, obsequious to the American laws and
constitution. Perhaps the writer of the
Chronicle got his information against the
Italians from some barkeeper or low poli
tician who could not fool the Italian
voters and get their support.
But were the writer of the Chronicle to
ask Information about the Italians from
many American tirms and business men,
for whom they work, or from the numer
ous farmers of our State, where the Ital
ians transformed thousand of acres of
land into fertile and productive soil, he
would use better, more just and generous
words for the Italian laborers who. by
confession of the most reputable agricul
tural, commercial and industrial men.
form a class at immigrants very desirable,
who become good, faithful and very
honest citizens.
In the hard struggle for life, in the un
equal battle between capital and labor, it
may arrive sometimes that the hottest
elements go too far in their action and
even commit crimes. These regretable
occurrences happen quite often also
among American laborers. All of us, to
mention one instance, remember the
great railroad strike in ISM. when a train
having on board the soMiers of our State
militia was maliciously derailed by some
of the strikers, and the result was the
death of several men. At that time no
American or foreign papers had the un
generous and we should say cowardly
courage of stating that the American la
borers are bad citizens or a band of mur
derers.
\\ hy should thi3 be said of the Italian
laborers, who, .In tha struggle for life,
find themselves in the same, it net worse,
conditions than those of their American
brothers? Why should a reputable Ameri
can paper ignore the elements of hos
pitality toward a class of people who are
the nephews of that great Italian whu
divined the existence of this immense and
generous land, and wno furthermore had
Â«i prominent part in building up the pro
gress and civilization of this country by
bringing here their capacities, their in
tellectual and physical strength?

XIIâ COMPOSITION OF A PIC
TURE.
BY F. DUNDAS TODD.
To the beginner photography Is simply
fascinating. To be able to record scenes
and incidents that interest him at the
time, with comparatively little trouble.
Is a wonderful step In advance for the
average individual, and he feels as if he
would never grow weary of such an art.
And then the mystery cf development.
Nothing, then something. From no
where there comes a suggestion of a real
ity, and little by little, as if through the
wave of a magician's wand, there grows
a counterfeit of nature on the plate. LJt
tle wonder la it that every beginner in
photography feels as If he could live In a
darkroom forever and be perfectly con
tent to develop plates throughout all
time.
But sooner or later the reaction set 3 In
and the once enthusiastic amateur'begins
to weary of photography. Why? I puz
zled over this problem for years before I
found the answer, and, I believe, the cor
rect one. It is contained In one word â
finality. So long as we human beings are
In pursuit of an object we never weary:
the moment we secure it our Interest flags
and soon we turn our thoughts In a new
direction.
Photography may interest the average
Individual from two standpoints, the tech
nical and the artistic. Of necessity the
technical is the first. He must learn to
expose and develop, to print and mount,
before he can utilize the art. and he be
comes so interested In this phase of pho
tography that he believes it to be the only
one. In but a few months an ordinary
persons usually has no difficulty in mak
ing all the manipulations essential to or
dinary photography, ajid then he feels his
education Is complete.
But when we turn to the artistic side
of photography we find very different
conditions prevailing. Art is long, and no
man's life is long enough to learn it all.
Here there is no finality. It Is ever a
case of pursuing something that is just a
little ahead of us but which recedes as
fast as we advance. To-day we are con
tent: to-morrow dissatisfied New we
know much; a week hence we lear.n there
is much we don't know. And it Is ever
the same, day by day, making photogr
raphy the most charming hoDby that was
ever devised for the pleasure of mortal
man.
A piece of music treats of one theme,
a picture tells only one story, therefore
there must be unity in a picture. Music
Is composed of notes, a picture of forms.
Butâ and here is a very important pomt â
all sounds are not musical notes, neither"
are all forms picturesque, therefore there
must be discrimination in their selection.
Forms vary in size, the shape of their
boundary lines and m their color. Notes
in a piece of music are arranged accord
ing to a definite scheme: in a picture tho
various elements must be grouped into
some definite form.
Whiie the numan eye craves composi
tion according to some definite form, it at
the same time demands variety in thai
form. Applying this idea we find ourselves
narrowed down considerably in our
choice, for the triangle is the only shape
that combines a definite shape with in
finite variety.
A triangle is a figure bounded by threÂ«
straight lmes^a definite form; but thesd
of necessity run in different directions â
that gives variety. Nay. more, we can
make each line different in length from the
other two. so that there is a wonderful
amount of diversity possible. We arÂ©
now getting on to firm ground in our
reasoning, and for the sake of clearness
it may be wise to get coed specific terms
to use. There are many forms of tri
angles, but only three really interest us:
First, those whose sides are all equal
(figure 1): second, those having two side 3
equal (figure 2>: third, those whose sides'
are all unequal (figure 3Â». The first and
second forms suggest a pyramid, and so
we will group them together and speak
of this form as pyramidal. The charac
teristic feature of figure 3 la the lons
diagonal line, and so we speak of such a
form of composition as being "diagonal
composition."
Of these tw<J forma of composition the
second Is the more common, as it Is the
bar-is of all landscape work, since all
retiring lines appear to ascend or descend
a? they happen to be below or above the
level of the eye. A country road, tho
banks of a river, the seashore, the margin
of a lake, all seem to ascend as they re
tire; while the eaves of a house, the tops
of a row of trees appear to descend.
Some years ago I was making some trial
exposuresâ not picture-making, which Is
something differentâ and I amused myseli
hauling a cow by the horns to a spot
where she formed a connecting point for
two line 3, one from the base of a treo
horizontally, the other from the top of the
tree diagonally and just touching the top
of a tree in the dlstar.ee. The result waa
a triangle, a very stiff, formal affair, no
doubt, but remove the crvw and there wns
nothing left; place her anywhere else and
the whole composition would bo disjointed.
Bit where she was she bound the whole
thing into something definite. From an
other point of view this object was very
Important. The weight of the picture wai
all to one si'le: by weight I mean the mass
of the material used, which In this case
onnsisted of the tree. hou=es and a pond.
On the other siile was nothing, sr> that the
composition did not balance. Something
very attractive to the f-ye had to be
placed on the right hand side so as to
even thing? up. The cow was selected
because of the Intense white spots on her
skin. and. small a? these were, they im
pressed the eye or weighed mentally a*
much as the dark trees. A spot that is
u?ed in this way Is called the balancing
spot.
Noteâ This study will be concluded next
week.

Condition of Local Theaters.
The Board of Public Works Is now
formulating Its report upon the condition
of the local theaters, which will be pre
sented to the Board of Supervisors next
Monday. The report states that the va
rious play houses were Inspected by Com
missioner Manson and an assistant. It
was found that some of them should be
compelled to Install additional facilities in
case of fire. More exits will be ordered
and the seating arrangements will have
to be improved. The ordinance which the
Supervisors will be requested to pass is
based on the one now In operation In
New York. It provides for an open space
or court on each side of the theater when
there is bu; one frontage. The storerooms,

Three of Them Heavily Fined for
Dumping Garbage in Vacant
Lots.
The Police Judges are determined to
assist the Board of Health and police in
stopping the practice of some scavengers
in dumping garbage on vacant lots
throughout the city instead of taking it to
the crematory. Since the introduction of
of the now^ordinance restricting the hours
for carting away garbage, the chance for
scavengers dumping it on vacant lota ha 3
been increased, as It is now done during
the night. .
Joe Capalini and Joe Maginl appeared
before Judge Conlan . yesterday for sen
tence and R. Domingo appeared before
Judge Megan. Capalini and Magini had
been arrested while dumping garbage at
Lombard and Laguna streets and Do
mingo had been- arrested at Fourteenth
and Castro streets. They were old of
fenders and had been warned of the pro
visions of the new ordinance. Each Judge
severely scored the defendants and im
posed a fine of $100 with the alternative of
100 days in jail.

KENNETH DUNCAN GETS
JUST ONE MORE CHANCE
Sentence on the Degenerate Preacher
Suspended â He Is Sent to
Ukiah.
Through the persistent efforts of
Charles Montgomery and others, J. Ken
neth Duncan, the degenerate preacher
and self-confessed thief, has been saved
from being sent to jail for his crimes.
Chief Sullivan was appealed to by Dun
can's friends and had no objection to giv
ing him another chance.
When Duncan appeared before Judge
Conlan yesterday the Judge said nothing
he could say would add to the humilia
tion and degradation which Duncan must
feel at his position. He had to thank the
State Prison Commission that the full
penalty of the law was not meted out to
him. Sentence would be suspended from
month to month pending his good be
havior, but if he transgressed again a
bench warrant would be issued for his ar
rest and he would be brought into court
and sentenced.
Duncan left the court with Montgom
ery, who Is to send him to a family near
Ukiah, who have undertaken the task of
trying once more to reform him. He has
so frequently shown his ingratitude to
friends that it Is expected the bench war
rant will soon be Issued.

STOWAWAY FROM
MEXICO KEPT IN
IRONS FOR DAYS
Cigar-Maker San Feliz of
Michigan Chained on
the Peru.
Proves That He Is an American
Citizen and Threatens a Suit
> Against the Company for
Damages.
>
When the deputy Immigration Commis
sioners boarded the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company's steamer Peru yesterday
for the purpose of examining Immigrants
as to their rights to land, a man was
brought before them heavily ironed. He
said that he had boarded the steamer at
San Bias, Mex., and stowed himself away,
he being without means to pay his pas
sage to the United States, and that upon
his discovery soon after by the vessels
officers he was placed in irons and kept in
chains during the entire voyage. He pro
duced papers showing that his name was
VViillam San Feliz. a native of the United
States and a member in good standing of
l h ,Â° C'earmakers' Union of Kalamazoo
Mich. '
The passengers expressed their indlgna-
Lloi?L lo i? f,Â° De P ut .v Immigration Commissioner
bchell at the manner in which San Feliz
had been treated and assured the unfor
tunate cigarmaker that they would be
willing, witnesses for him should he seek
redress through legal channels. He said
that, being impecunious, he would lay the
matter before the clgarmakers' union and
ask th<?ir assistance in righting the wrong
that had been done him.
Captain Schell was convinced from the
evidence submitted to him that San Feliz
was an American citizen and entitled to
lane; and the irons were accordingly
struck from the limbs of the prisoner and
he was allowed to go ashore.
I earned vacation. Ho has now been a
; little over two years on the. coast and
I during all that time has not seen his wife
j and children. Captain Egenes brought
i the Titanla here from the Orient under
i charter to John Rosenfeld's Sons. Since
' she has been on the coast she has made
I fifty round trips between San Francisco
; and Nanalmo. B. C. Her trips north
i were nearly all in ballast, but on the fifty
. trips back she has brought down in all
2C7.5C5 tons of coal. During the entire
tfme there has not been an accident nor a
disagreement aboard the vessel and Cap
tain Egenes starts for home with the re
spect and good wishes of the entire mer
cantile community. Captain Egenes ex
pects to be gone about six months and
during his absence Captain Eulllcksen will
; command the Titania.
Water Front Notes.

Several Chinese Attempt to
Escape Prom Steamer
Tartar.
Caught by the Nig-ht Watchman and
a Policeman After a Lively
Chass and Put Back on the
Ex-TransportL
?
The ex-transport Tartar, which sailed
for British Columbia yesterday, came
very near leaving some of her Chinese
crew behind her. The vessel was tied up
at the transport wharf and Wednesday
night several of the coolies made a break
for liberty. They knew that once the
steamer reached Victoria, B. C, their
chances of ever seeing San Francisco's
Chinatown again would be very slim so
a party of them made up their minds to
desert. They made their way past the
Quartermaster on the gangway and two of
them managed to slip out through the
pate into East street, but that was as far
as they got. Xight V.'atchman Rush
pounced down on them and while he held
the two runaways by the queues he kept
the others back with a club and raised
an alarm. The policeman on the beat
came to his assistance and the Chinese
were driven aboard the vessel, where they
remained until the Tartar went to sea.
Green-Street Wharf Afire.
The wharf at the foot of Green street
had a narrow escape from destruction yes
terday. Had it not been for the prompt
action of Wharfinger Arnerlch, who form
ed a bucket bripade, there would have
been a conflagration. The bark Gladys.
from Iquique. is discharging nitrate at the
wharf and the structure is covered with
dust from the cargo. Some one threw a
match on the dust-covered wood and In
a second the fire was running all over the
place. When a small heap of nitrate
would be reached it would make a great
flare. After some hard work the bucket
brigade got the fire out. ;

MKW YORK. April 19â Business on the
ft'-ck Excl.ance to-day lapsed into a condition
of dullness and abandonment to that operation
<if th>> email professional traders. Much angry
recrimination continues to be heard on all
â¢ ides concerning the bear raid on the iron
and steel rtocks. Not only In the stock mar
ket, but in the Iron trade as well accusations
of bad faith and double-deaUng are bandied
ElKjUt. All othtr authorities In the trade dis
agree with the views of Chairman Ciates of
Urn American Steel and Wire Company, but
Ihe Iron Age says in its review of the subject:
"No s^harp tumble in values is expected un
les-e this development in the wire trade should
jiroduce such an effect." It Is the reservation
thus expreFsÂ«Â»d fcliat has so effectually upset
the speculative world. Dealers in securities
l.ppt Â«>ne Â«->e on the iron and Kteel etocks all
day and the erratic and irregular movements
in that group kept the whole market In a
feverish and uncertain etate. When pressure
there was relaxed there was a disposition man
liest to mark uj> prices elsewhere, but the bur
<i<-r. <'f stlllr.g met on the advance gave an
ui<pearar.ce Qt a desire to realize on an ex- j
tencive scale and took the snap out of the
juarkft. <Jn the ether liand llie majority of
Fti-cks 'iJlered decreased materially on a con
f id'-rable decline, giving an undertone of firm
ness to i>rioÂ«. Notable strength was shown at i
one time by the Baltimore and Ohio Etocks and I
<-n the other hand Southern Pacific Buffered 1
fr'^m decided weakness. The one movement
bad about as much effect on the general llFt 1
tit- the other. The sharp advance in the metal !
JiKt, which followed the declines after the J
<'t>enlnE. was accompanied by a rise late in I
the day to best prices. But when these Ftocks I
end fcugar save way the whole list followed j
and the closing wae active and easy, consid- |
rnibly below the best. Hucar. after Belling up j
as 1 high as ICSVi. closed at a net loss of 2
joints. The nÂ»Â»-8 of the tfay was generally
Ignored. It included a number of strong etate-
DKBta <'i earnings for the second werk In April,
especially by soft coal carrying roads. Rumors
of r.ew combinations of railroad Fystems con
tinue prevalent. The Chicago, Indianapolis and
Kouli-'ville is now raid to be destined for ab
forr-'lion by the Southern Railway, and there
Â»re fetories of the Vanderbllts buying of Wa
l>a.sh *ecuritles. The Southwestern group of
no-called Gould railroads are formed into vari
ous combinations by the rumor-mongers. The
Fmall amount of foreign proxies voted at the
New York Central annual meeting was re
parded ; â¢ significant of the. recent foreign sell
ing of high-priced securities and explanatory
of the upward movement of exchange which
continued to-day. Money continues easier and
a rtrong bar.k statement on Saturday is con
sidered assured.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April 19.â While the mild spring
weather elevated the spirits of the speculators
the effect on the wheat market was different.
Cables also had a depressing effect, besides
there was the liquidation which probably would
have taken place whatever the conditions.
While the speculative trade was light the cash
business was excellentâ 2so,ooo bushelsâ some of
It No. 1 northern and some of It No. 2 red.
This business served to bring about a bulge
following the opening, but it did not hold and
the close was barely steady. The cash sales.
83,000 bushels, were for direct export. New
York reported thirty loads taken for export.
Foreigners were sellers of July early. May
opened V<J4c down at 654@65%q, sold between
Cj^c and BC..ift6i*<c and closed 4c under yes
terday at CJ4c July began the session %c to
4'flNc down at 66-y4'fii66Tic to 67c, ranged be
tween 67Vic and 66 r ftc, closing Â»4c under at
66\.*J6Â«*ic.
The corn market was generally quiet. As In
wheat the main consideration was the excellent
spring climatic conditions with lower cables
a contributing factor in the weakness which
was evident the greater part of the session.
May closed %<>j\c under yesterday as did July.
The trade In oats was not important, but
the market nevertheless exhibited considerable
strength in sympathy with corn. May closed
%c down.
Jn spite of speculatu-e dullness and a hog
market Inclined to weakness the provision
market was firm. Buying by packers against
liberal cash sales and the light offerings were
the factors. May and July pork closed 5c
over yesterday; May and July lard 24c down
and May and July ribs unchanged.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Cash quotations were as follows: Flour,
easy; No. 2 red. GS4fj6!)4c; No. 2 corn, 3S>/ 2 Â«
3S%c: No. 2 oats, 24K<?24lic; No. 2 white, Z7Hc:
No. 3 white. 2fiW274c; No. 2 rye. SsH@Â»6c; No.

London Mirkct
NEW YORK. April 19.-"-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
There was no Increase of business In the mar
kets here to-day and the tone was dull. Amer
icans were Idle. They made a difficult advance
above parity, but New York came a seller of
Union Pacific, which London continued to buy,
creating a fairly large account. Baltimore and
Ohio was the only stock New York bought,
letting the market go flat. In the street there
was a feverish rally. Coppers began flat on
New York's quotation for metal and Paris
refrained from supporting Tlntos, which Lon
don beared. Then Paris began to buy, caus
ing a rally. Tlntos closed at 59 'Â¦;<*, having been
at IS%. Anacondas closed at 10 7-16, having
been at 10 3-16. Money was wanted for the
war loan pay-day, but nothing was due the
Bank of England, which did a large buslnesn
In discounts, relieving the pressure. Calls
finished steady. Silver stationary, simply be
cause New York Is holding off. The market
looks "rocky" If New York sells.

THE Mayday outing to be given at
GJeo I'ark by the San Francisco
Public School Teachers' Annuity So
ciety for the benefit of its retirement
fund promises to be a monster affair, and
it is calculated that 50,000 people will visit
the pleasure grounds on that day. At a
meeting of the department of supervision
yesterday it was Judged from responses
to circulars that SO.oijy tickets oX admission
are already Bold, amounting to $4000. With
other receipts it is believed that the
necessity of reducing the retirement rate
will be obviated.
Not the least interesting feature of the
affair will be the souvenir programme, for
which competitive designs have been sub
mitted by the pupils of the industrial art
department of the Polytechnic High
School, of which Miss Marie Van Vleck Is
the head. The design of Miss Anna Luk-
ens has been selected to grace the front
page cover. Creditable designs were also
drawn by Miss Camille Johnson, Miss
Mattie Adams. Miss Cornelia Felt, Miss
Isabel Johnson and Miss Lorella Murdoch
Twenty thousand programmes will be
printed and distributed.
Designs for badges in the two university
colors have been submitted by Miss Marie
Boutin, Miss Adelaide Dibble, Miss Ger
aldine Bohen, Miss Nonle Adams and
Miss Camille Johnston, but no selection
has as yet been made. *

Refused to Divulge to Dodge.
The trial of A. B. Caldwell, proprietor of
the Pioneer Warehouse, was commenced
before Justice of the Peace Barry yester
day. Caldwell has been sued by Assessor
Dodge for J2OO because of his refusal to
divulge the amount of personal property
stored in. his warehouse in the name of
various firms. Attorney Marsh endeav
ored to have the Assessor subscribe to
an agreed statement of facts in order to
have the Supreme Court decide whether
he can compel warehousemen to make a
sworn statement of goods not beloging to
them,- but held on storage for others.
Dodge absolutely refused to do bo, claim-
Ing that the Political, Code gave him the
authority to exact statements. Marsh
paid that the Assessor had brought suit
simply that he might be allowed to annoy
and worry inoffensive persons. Judge
Barry will decide the case next Saturday.
Showers All Over the State.
It is predicted by Weather Prophet Mc-
Adle that there will bo a goodly number
of Bhowers all over California to-day. The
cause of it Is a big storm that is raging
east of the Sierras, bringing southeasterly
winds along the western coast. Mr. Mc-
Adle states that the storm center Is in
Nevada, hence the slopover of showers on
the west side of the mountains. Yesterday
Is sprinkled over the central and northern
(sections of the State, extending even as
far south as Merced and Modesto.

STRIKING ITALIANS
ARE UNDER ARREST
Search for Weapons Made in the
Houses of the Laborers â Fright
ened Inmates Flee.
CROTON LANDING. N. V., April 19.â
This was by far the liveliest day in and
around the Croton Valley since the strike
began, seventeen days ago. The civil and
military authorities played a very promi
nent part In the day's proceedings and tht
result is that twenty-six Italians are now
behind prison bars, awaiting examination
on charges of inciting to riot and carry
ing weapons with intent to inflict bodily
Injury.
Sheriff Molloy of Westchester County
secured thirty-two warrants for tho ar
rest of the leaders of the strikers and also
search warrants for the houses in the
Italian colonies where the laborers lived,
from Judge Smith at Sing Sing.
This fact became known last night and
more than 100 Italians fled from their
homes during the night to avoid arrest.
It was said to-day that fully 150 men who
had struck for higher wages had gone to
New York and Syracuse, where they have
secured other places.
The Sheriff, with a posse of twenty-five
deputies, escorted by Company D of the
Seventh Regiment, arrived at the Bow
ery about 9 o'clock, where they imme
diately began a thorough search of the
houses for weapons and ammunition and
whenever they came across a person for
whom they had a warrant- they placed
him under arrest. There was not the
slightest resistance made, except by one
man. In the Bowery nine prisoners were
captured.
The Sheriff then went to the other side
of the river and scoured the houses on top
of the hill and in Little Italy. In this
round-up, which lasted nearly four hours,
sixteen prisoners were captured.
OWENS ARRESTED.
Wanted for the Murder of Ed Hall
at Lytton Springs.
SANTA ROSA, April 19.â At about 4
o'clock this morning T. J. Owens, charged
with the murder of Ed Hall In a cottage
at Lytton Springs last night, was cap
tured by a Sheriff's posse at his home In
Alexander Valley. He made no effort to
escape and denies that he committed the
murder.

Springs and was Identified by two women
who were in the house when the shooting
occurred. The officers are sure they have
the right man. Owcn3 admitted being at
Lyttons last night, and says he met a
man going to the springs who had a rifle
in his hands. Later he said that he had
no knowledge of what happened for about
two hours last night, as he was crazy
drunk. He remembers having gone to the
house where the murder took place.

Spaulding, in a letter to the Collector of
Customs, San Francisco, decides that
hereafter bags entered for exportation
with the benefit of drawback must be
plainly marked "for drawback" upon the

that large quantities of bags are snipped
to Mexico and Central America as extra
coverings and by turning the bags inside
out, with the unmarked surface presented
to view, they have been used as coffee
bags, thereby facilitating evasions of the
duty.
Senator Perkins' bill for the prevention
of towing rafts of logs at sea, which
passed the Senate seme time ago, has
not yet been reported from the commit
tee to which it was referred in the House.
It is said certain speculators in the raft
ing business are trying to kill the bill
and have thus far delayed its being re
ported to the House. It is probable that
the bill will not get out of committee un
less the commercial bodies of San Fran
cisco and the Pacific Coast take some
action urging the California Representa
tives to secure if possible Its favorable
report, to the House.
The Senate Military Committee has ma
terially amended the Root bill for the
reorganization of the army and will re
port It in a few days. The measure pro
vides for the new grade of lieutenant gen
eral and for the rank of major general
for adjutant general. The section relat
ing to lieutenant general is made specially
to apply to General Miles by providing
that the new grade be filled by the
"senior major general now commanding
the army." The new section, evidently
aimed at such cases as that of General
Egan's, provides that the President may
place on the retired list "any officer who
has been suspended from duty by sen
tence of court-martial." The bill also
provides a plan of organizing the artil
lery into corps of two branches, coast and
field at the head of which is to be the
chief of artillery with the rank of brig
adier general.

WAS WEIGHTED DOWN
Grewsome Discovery of Two Amateur
Fishermen Outside the Golden
Gate, Near Fort Point.
Albert Willis of 171S Leavenworth street
and George Llttlefield of 19 Glover street,
while engaged in fishing three-quarters of
a mile outside of Fort Point yesterday
morning, discovered the body of a
man floating out with the tide. The case
is evidently one of suicide, as the corpse
was weighted down with a piece of iron.
The fishermen made the body fast to thu
boat, but the rope parted and the corpse
drifted away.
In response to their signals the mem
bers of the life-saving station at Bakers
Beach put out a boat and recovered the
body and held It until the Coroner's depu
ties arrived to take it to the Morgue.
The body was that of a man about 35
years old. with black hair and full face
It was clothed in dark blue round sack
coat, vest and trousers, black laced gait
ers, white shirt with standing collar and
gray woolen underwear. A pocket knife,
a comb, Kold watch and an Oakland ferry
ticket (No. 24,2*1) were found in the
pockets. s
In the left hand coat pocket was an
iron weight tied with a piece of rope, the
other end of which was tied to the left
wrist.

DEATH RESULTED FROM
SOLAR PLEXUS BLOWS
OAKLAND, April 19.â Edward E.
Lamping, son of P. A. Lamping
and a former member of the Oak
land Police Department, died at an
early hour this morning. He was at one
time among the crack amateur athletes
of Oakland and was fond of all kinds of
sports. For some years he has been do
ing some boxing work with rising pugi
lists, and has been offering himself as a
subject for the practice of the famous
"solar plexus" blow. Being of a strong
and robust constitution this did not harm
him for a while, but in the course of time
it produced an effect upon the heart,
forcing it out of place and weakening its
action, which finally resulted in his death.
Bipeds, With and
Without Feathers
C-i rÂ» ADEMOISELLE MARZELLA is
//\/\ certainly the feature of the Or
lllk*\> P neum blll tnl3 week, not that
she does anything wonderful her
self, but she exhibits a flock of trained
birds that are sensutionally novel. Made
moiselle Marzella's labors in this act are
not severe, but it is difficult to estimate
the amount of patience and industry she
has expended in educating her macaws,
cockatoos, ravens, parrots and pigeons.
The methods she pursues in teaching
these feathered bipeds to do the tricks
the % y perform must remain an enigma.
One can imagine how monkeys and doga
are taught to be human with the aid of
a whip, but the chastising of birds is
quite oeyond comprehension and the re
sults attained are as inexplicable as they
are wonderful.
The act in so much more Interesting
than I expected that I cannot but give it
preference. It is something that must be
seen to be appreciated, for the feats ac
complished are so extraordinary that
there can be no adequate description of
them offered in words, and yet 1 cannot
resist expressing my wonderment at such
things as a back somersault by a cock
atoo and the spectacle of a raven Jump
ing through rings* of tire.
Mademoiselle Marzella's act is quite
gorgeous in point of ornamental equip
ment and her company of half a hundred
variegated fowls give color, movement
and noise to the penormance. It Is great.
Hobby Gaylor does a turn that is half
monologue and half singing. He is bet
ter In the former for his Jokes are droll
and it must be granted that he is the
originator of a very amusing Irish man
ner.
Miss Moore Is the better-half of Bell
man and Moore, who do a rather indif
ferent act. It is her attractiveness alone
that saves this Item of the programme,
which is such as is usually offered by
second-raters. She is worthy of better
things.
Faike and Semon are not new, but their
"stuff" is funny enough to laugh the
audience and their comedy is more taking
than the music they dispense In various
eccentric ways.
The act by Duncan, the ventriloquist,
is rather long, but unusually clever of its
kind.
There is one other turn that is worthy
of more than passing notice and that is
the dancing of the De Forrests. They
are marvels of agility and accomplish
terpsichorean miracles with an ease and
enthusiasm that is astounding.
The Guitanos, a "triumvirate" of acro
bats, again prove that everything Is pos
sible in vaudeville, and one Si Stebblns
entitles himself to a place on the pro
gramme by some original tricks with
cards that are startlingly clever.
The Empire Comedy Four are not "such
a much" and sing like a wire fence. One
of them is half funny.

ROSA REEVES' ROMANCE
RATHER COMMONPLACE
Drank Lots of Absinthe and Had a
Vicious and Ungovernable
Temper.
Detective Anthony told a Coroner's Jury
yesterday all that he krew of the life
history of Helen Gray, alias Rosa Reeves,
alias Jennie Reed, the young woman who
died last Tuesday morning in the City
Receiving Hospital from the effects of
poison taken with suicidal Intent. The
detective knocked all the romance out of
her story, tor he testified that she had
an ungovernable temper, aggravated by
the habit of absinthe drinking.
Several months ago. he said, while sho
was living at 31S Sutter street, she had a
quarrel with her sweetheart, a Jockey
named Harry Springer, and cut his
clothes Into tatters. She followed up thl3
mad freak by attempting suicide by
slashing her left wrist with a knife.
For this exhibition of temper she was
ordered out of the house, and took up her
quarters on Stockton street, which p!ace
she was obliged to leave on account of
her tantrums three weeks ago.
The Jury rendered a verdict of suicide.
It Is known that Jessie Reed was not the
girl's real name. She has two sisters, one
In this city and one '.n Stockton, both re-
Bpectable women. It was at their expense
that the body was jriven decent burial.
ON Tuesday next the Grand Parlor
of the Native Sons of the Golden
West will convene at Oroville. at
which convention it will be de
termined on whom the much-coveted
honor of grand marshal for the next
parade will be bestowed. As the date
of the session approaches a keen com
petition has made itself manifest in the
camps of the various candidates.
The latest aspirant for the' leadership
of the coming pageant is Stephen \.
Costello, a well-known young member of
the legal fraternity of this city. Mr.
Costello is in the hands of his friends,
who are not lacking in energy in advocat
ing his candidacy and who declare that
they are behind the winner.
For fifteen years Mr. Costello has been
a member of the Native Sons, having
joined the order In Petaluma as a mem
ber of the Bear Parlor of that city. Three
years later he joined Pacific Parlor of
this city and has been through all the
chairs of that branch and is a member
of the Past Presidents Association.
Mr. Cnstelio has been a delegate to the
Grand Parlor at many sessions and has
served on Important committees. Twelve
years ago he became a member of the
bar of San Francisco.
HENSHAW TAKES
AN EXPENSIVE
WALK IN OGDEN
Banker Misses His Train
and Hires Special to
Overhaul It.
Goes for a Cruise Around Town and
Returns to the Depot as His
Car Disappears in the
Distance.
I Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. April 19.
William G. Henshaw, president of the
Union Savings Bank of this city, had to
hire a special train at Ogden, Utah, yes
terday because he took a walk that was a
little too long. Knowing that there is
always a short stop at Ogden, Mr. Hen
shaw, who was on hl3 way to Europe
with his wife, thought he would take a
little walk about the town.
Unfortunately for Mr. Henshaw, the
train upon which he arrived was an hour
late and he returned to the station just in
time to see it pulling out.
Knowing that he could not make
steamer connections unless he went on
that train, he hired a special engine and
chased the regular, making a run of seven
miles in eight minutes, finally overhauling
his train. That little walk uptown was
expensive.

Parson's Epistles to His Wife
Burned With Passionate
Appeals to Forgive.
Mrs. Kingore Has Faith in Her Son-in-Law
and Advises Her Daughter to
Yield.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway; April 19.
sjnj? LTA KINGORE DAVIS, the pretty
// \\ wife of Edwards Davis, has sud-
Jl \ denly departed for New York with
the determination to have pressed a
puit for divorce. Behind her she leaves a
record in the shape of correspondence that
puts her husband's eide of the matri
monial entanglement In a new light.
Davis was in New Orleans when he was
informed that his wife had decided to free
hercelf. Here is his appeal to her to re
*ra*n:
"Listen. Alta. there is absolutely no
limit to my love. I will grant anything,
even that I may never ccc you. if you
will but continue to be my wife. A di
vorce means disaster. . . . Think you
that I can release Tny clutch upon my only
l^ve without a death struggle? O, merci
ful God: Alta. you have nc%"er known the
raging tire I have tried to control within
jr.e bt-cause of you, the only love I have
ever had or can have again."
That outburst of passionate adoration
did not move the young woman. She
maintained resolutely her decision to se
cure a decree of divorce.
The disheartened husband then took his
mother-in-law. Mrs. M. H. KJngore. into
his confidences and recited to her some of
his troubles. Some extracts from his let
ter follow. Speaking of his wife he wrote:
"When I loved her I loved her enough to
marry her. When 1 married her 1 mar
ried forever.. That wa> the main reason
that I could give up my chosen profession.
I became indifferent because I saw the
general futility of much preaching. I saw
the Eham of pretended conversion. I am
r.ot morbid. Christ to me is as change
less as love â the love, not of the flesh, but
eternal."
There is a Fhnrp touch upon the experi
ences which forced him out of the Cen
tral Christian Church pulpit. "But it
seemed to me that all mere ministers
should bo. to say the least, magnanimous.
When I succeeded 1 was envied; then act
ually boycotted. Presuming 1 was guilty
of every charge made against me, after
that Santa Cruz fiasco, 1 should have
thought even from the politic pen of
hypocrisy 1 would have received two mes
sages of sympathy. 1 did set one from
a stranger. But, no, the brethren were
too sincere, and so I decided to go higher.
I am happier now and nearer God than
ever I was at a material altar. Under the
weight of an almost interminable succes
sion of sorrows, had not I been a man of
much endurance and natural faith. I
might almost have felt that God had for
saken me; but he has held me by his
hand: 1 have been led by him to indi
vidual freedom."
There was something to encourage the
zealous hiihband. for throe weeks later'he
wrote to his wife, declaring: "I have no
reason to believe that the love that lived
is dead or dying."
But apain ho repeat? In words of rap
turous adoration: *'I shall love you for
ever, cling to you as a last hope. I hardly
think even you could drive me to relin
quish the hold the tendrils of my heart
have made upon your beautiful, chaste
being. ? â¢ â¢ I believe you will be willing
to wait as Ions: as I manifest my zeal to
accomplish our eventual reunion by work
in? and doing: all in my utmost power to
prove my worthiness."
Again "he wrote begging for indulgence.
Said the distressed husband: "Tell me
your secret heart's desire and I will strive
to fulfill thy hope. What is your am
bitionâyour future? Let me be even the
piU-nt factor in your realm."
Anothtr passage carried confidence. "I
never have believed you fickle or shal
low, but to the contrary have watched
with amazing- pride the power you have
exercised to withstand the assaults of
temptation upon your purity."
Mrs. Kingore declares her belief in her
son-in-law's constancy and has advised
her daughter not to proceed with the di
vorce undertaking.

GEORGE BLOOMQUEST, juvenile man of the Neill company, Is to wed Miss
Rose Swain, teacher of Latin and Greek in the University of Minnesota.
The bride to be is on her way out here to meet the man of her choice and
the wedding of the actor and the teacher will follow shortly after the lady's
arrival in this city.
Of course, It is a love story and it dates back to the Nelll Company's long
stay in Minneapolis. Miss Swain, in spite of her Latin and Greek proJlclency,
is a great admirer of the theater and spent every Saturday afternoon in true
matinee girl style at the playhouse. First she admired young Bloomquest and
the result of the learned lady's admiration was a meeting between herself and
the idol of the matinee girls. After Mi.Â«s Swain and the actor met things moved
rapidly and smoothly and the announcement of their betrothal followed very soon
after.
Miss Swain is coming out here in company with Mrs. M. Garbett and Elmer
Bloomquest, a brother of the groom, who is the cashier of the Swedish-American
Bank In Minneapolis. Mr. Bloomquest and Miss Swain are to be married In the
Episcopal church. Elmer Bloomquest will be the best man and Miss Julia Dean,
of the Nelll company will be one of the bridesmaids. Early in June the happy
groom and his young bride will sail for Honolulu with the Nelll 5 company,
where they will spend their honeymoon.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 20, 1900.
NAUGHTY TRUE
BLUE DEFEATED
SPEEDY SARDINE
Greatly Jarring the Finer
Senses of Corrigan's
Followers.
Sly and Rosormonde Displayed Mys
tifying Reversals of Form.
Figgott Cannot Rido at
Oakland.
As the racing season draws to a close
a new "phenom" bobs up In Billy Apple
by'B Duke of Norfolk horse, True Blue.
Always considered a more than useful
piece of equine furniture, the chestnut
has of late shown stake form. Yesterday
at Tanforan Park he started In a five
and a half furlong dash with Sardine and
Sly, and after getting four or five lengths
the worst of tho send-off, displayed a
sensational turn of speed, collaring and
beating out Sardine a neck in 1:06%. The
latter filly went to the post a 7 to 20
favorite. Beaten only two lengths, Sly
showed such, sudden and marked im
provement as to indicate that in her two
previous attempts she could not have
been "meant."
The crowd, which was not large, did not
purchase very extensively of bookmak
ers' pasteboards. Three first choices were
beaten.
Romany, a 15 to 1 shot ridden by Logue,
led from the start in the opening mile
run. Alaria, the favorite, hard ridden
from the jump, managed to get the place,
two lengths before Glengaber.
Ames again had the leg up on Rosor
monde, and he piloted the mare in an en
tirely different manner from the exhibi
tion given some days ago, when Mortgage
walked home in slow time. Allotted luU
pounds In the mile handicap and ruling a
7 to 5 favorite, Ames took his mount out
in front from the start, winning at the
wire more than two lengths from Catas
trophe, in 1:40%. Henry Shields was orig
inally posted to ride The Fretter, which
ran third, but the judge 3 did not like the
looks of the betting, almost at the last
moment substituting Baspinger.
Diderot,' the fast "trick" from the At
kins & Lottridge barn, was Installed a
pronounced favorite for the four-and-a
half furlong scramble, but the wise
money went in on Homage and the lat
ter miss closed the post choice. Right at
the start Shields, on Homage, crossed
over, cutting everything off, after which
it was clear sailing for him. Logue,
astride Diderot, got through after a time,
leading out Gaylon Brown for place
honors.
Corrigan's Sardonic had nothing much
to beat in the mile and a furlong selling
event, disposing of her company off the
reel. Donator, the second choice, took
the place quite as handily from Terrene.
The concluding mile selling run was a
most open betting affair, with Storm
King and Imp. Mmstral selling at the
same price, 5 to 1. Stuart, with Bishop
Reed, slipped away In the lead and was
never caught, finishing less than a length
in advance of Storm King at the wire.
Track Notes.
The Elmwood stock farm horses were
scratched from the different events for
which they were entered yesterday, ow
ing to the death of William Boots, father
of Charles Boots. Mr. Boots has the
sympathy of all turfmen zn his bereave
ment.
After being deprived of the mount on
The Fretter by the Judges. Henry
Shields asked to be excused from further
riding during the day, a request granted
by the stand.
The stewards of the California Jockey
Club announce that Jockey Joe Piggott
will no longer be allowed to ride at Oak
land track, for reasons that will be made
public later.
Ivy Powell was indefinitely suspended
for a ride on Glengaber that did not
please the judges^

ICOLadles' fine kid shoes, worth $3, for $1.23

The present Board of School Directors
has broken away from the policy set by-
Its predecessor in Its consistent fight for
the establishment of a system where pri
ority of appointment prevailed in the se
lection of teachers to fill vacancies. No
longer will the equitable method of se
lection for priority of enrollment be in
use. Favoritism has again been installed.
After the creation of scores of teachers
by the board which served In IS9S the de
partment was ' flooded with unnecessary
school appointees, and the expenses in
creased month by month far beyond the
appropriation of the Supervisors. Last
year's board made a total sweep of all
unnecessary teachers, retrenching ex
penses and following a fixed line of econ
pmy in this respect. At the same time a
resolution was adopted which placed the
teachers thrown out on the substitute
list, and: that all future regular appoint
ments should follow the chronological or
Â£er of the acceptance of the teachers as
members of the department.
The ' present board does not believe In
priority of appointment as a rule. On
March 28 if adopted a' resolution that all
teachers appointed . from the substitute
list should be made regular teachers only
upon recommendations of principals and
not -according to the old rule. In other
words; arteacher who was entered on the
substitute' list a year ago might receive
an appointment. before one who came into
the department. six months prior to that
time." Thespontention of the board is that
a substitute: who takes a class where a
vacancy, -has occurred becomes familiar
with .'the pupils, and if the recommenda
tion of the principal follows the appoint
ment should be made. There is no check
upon. the old system of favoritism except
a previous service as substitute. Luck or
pull seems to be the measure of future
appointments.
On the very, day the old rule was' re
pealed, and the new one adopted four
teachers were appointed.. Miss M Kyne

THE Fifth Congressional District Re
publican Committee met last even
ing in the office of W. 11. Cobb. In
the Parrott building, and resolved
that the voters of the district should
have no voice in the selection of delegates
to the State and District Conventions.
The action of the committee was not unex
pected. At the conference of the joint
committees of th*s Fourth and Fifth Con
gressional districts, held at the Palace
Hotel early last week, it was noted that
committeeraen of the Fifth were active in
bringing forward every imaginable objec
tion to the primary system of electing
delegates. It appears now that the pro
gramme to appoint was fixed up shortly
after the adjournment of the Republican
State Central Committee. Many Republi
cans who attended the session of that
committee, at Golden Gate Hall, will call
to mind that J. Alva Watt openly pro
claimed that primary elections would be
held in all the Assembly districts of San
Francisco embraced. within the boundaries
of the Fifth Congressional District. At
the conference held subsequently in the
rooms of JosexÂ»h S. Spear, in the Palace
Hotel, It was remarked that Watt had
changed front and was opposing prima
ries.
Before the committee met in regular
fashion at Cobb's office last night there
uas a little caucus. The address to the
voters and the resolutions of the sub-com
:r.iltee. all typewritten and lixed up to
MJtt the manipulators behind the scene*,
vi-re produced. When the committee met
I:-, regular session the programme was ac
<<lited without a murmur of dissent. The
hand of J. D. Mackenzie of Santa Clara
was not shown in the manipulation, but
doubtless he directed Watt to change
front and persuaded others to fall Into
line. As a political agent "Johnny" Mac
kenzie is as smooth as sala<i nil.
When the minutes of the previous meet
ing "were under consideration last night
Mr. Cohb made the pertinent suggestion
that the minutes be corrected to show
that J. Alva Watt derived authority to
appoint the committee from a resolution
of the convention of JS3S. Mr. Watt said
he v.-ould make that motion himself.
Ajrain he promised to submit the attested
minutes of the convention, showing the
adoption of a resolution giving him power
lo appoint the Congressional committee.
3t is now in order for Watt to remove the
rioud from the committee's title.
Max Goldberg, chairman, presented a
letter from the Good Government League
of Santa Clara County. The letter sets
lorth that 2UOO Republican voters demand
j.rimarSos and protest against the appoint
ment of delegates. The communication
v.-if placed on tile.
The report of the sub-committee on ap
portionment was read and adopted. The
representation by Assembly districts was
given in The Call last week.
In the course of the discussion follow-
jority working down slowly. The rail
ways, too, are employing a great many
of the Japanese. The Northern Pacific
line has now 4000 at work on its line and
the Great Northern Railway another 1000.
One fact is certain â of all the incoming
coolies not 13 per cent remain here or in
British Columbia. The steamer Victorian
since last week has several days carried
as many as 30") or 400 across to Seattle.

3->ACOMA. Wash.. April 29.-An officer
of the steamship Goodwin, which
arrived yesterday from Japan, says
that a regular emigration craze has
.. .,' .' taken hold of Japan with respect
to the shipment of thousands of young
Japanese to the United States. He says
that steamers now due are bringing 22u0
more Japanese to be lar.de4 at Seattle and

His story of the emigration movement in
Japan is as follows:
Several score emigration agents are at

Interior of Japan. They hold out induce

from Japanese now in America telling of

At one of the houses where they are

the immigration insj>ectors is returned to

â¢ â¢migration company in Japan. Emigra

to believe that they will pet easy posi

landing they find usually that railroad
v.ork is ahead of them, but they neverthe
less receive the $1 in gold a day which
they expected on starting. An oxamina
Â¦>ii>n of the several hundred Japanese
bronght by the Goodwin shows that prac
tically all are under 23 years of age. They
are thus not strong enough for heavy
cork, their weight running from 115 to 123
pounds. The steamship officer in ques
tion says it is understood on the other
t^df that Ss,tiOo to 50.000 more Japanese are
to be shipped to this country this year if
nothing is done to Ftip the influx. For
several years emigration agents have
been shipping laborer? to Ha.waii. The
Hawaiian authorities have temporarily
stopped the influx there, throwing the
main channel of immigration to Puget
Sound and California-
Hundreds About Due.
Large shipments of Japanese have ar
rived on Puget Sound this week per Rio
Jun Maru, Milos and the Goodwin. About
1200 more are coming on the Braemar, due
before Saturday. There is reason to be
lieve that emigration agents make at least
50 per cent profit out of the $60 paid them
by each immigrant. As near as can be
learned the steamship companies receive
$15 to $18 per head, making handsome re
turns for the steamship companies, since
the cost of feeding Japanese in parties
of a thousand or more does not exceed
$1 50 to $2 each. It Is noticeable that the
Japanese are all dressed alike and most of
them carry hand satchels which are also
exactly alike. This leads to the conclu
sion that they are outfitted in Tokio, Yo
kohama and Kobe by firms which furnish
their supplies In wholesale quantities. Al
lowing $1S for steamship fare and $12 for
an outfit, the emigration agent still has
$C 0 left for hi.s own services. A steamship
officer who has made public this mode of
procedure will not permit the use of his
name for obvious reasons. He says that
?o fully impressed are many farmers with
the opportunity to make fortunes afforded
their sons in this country that they do
not hesitate to mortgage their small plots
of ground to raise the necessary $60.
It is noticeable that many Japanese land

who have landed here to wire or mail

VICTORIA, B. C, April 19.â Another
thousand Japanese are at the wharf here
waiting until the authorities shall allow
the steamer Milos, a filthy German tramp,
on which they came, to enter. The crowd
brought by the Milos brings the total
number of arrivals here from Japan since

the way to this port, SOO on the steamer
Braemar, due here on Monday; 1600 on

ing a motion to adopt the plan of ap
pointing delegates Messrs. Cobb and
Watt reiterated their statements that
they had not hoard of a single demand
for a primary election. Mr. Watt did not
know why- th* 1 <Â»ood Government League
had Incorporated his name in the letter
to the chairman of the committee. He
imagined that the club had not the back
ing of the people of San Jose In its fac
tional quarrels.
These unkind allusions to the Good Gov
ernment Club did not call forth a pro
test from Mr. Mackenzie or Mr. O'Xeai
of San Jose.
Mr. Cobb brought the attention of the
committee to the main question by mov
ing the adoption of the resolutions to ap
point delegates.
E. I. Robinson asked permission to make
a suggestion. He said: "Why Include
this nonsense of inviting people to send
in names If the committee intends to ap
point?"
- He was told that he misunderstood the
reading of the resolutionâ that there was
no invitation for people to send In names.
A carpful reading of tho resolutions and
address will show whether Mr. Robinson
was right or wrong in his surmise. Pre
amble and resolutions as follows were
then adopted:

methods as proposed by the Congressional
committee will not be tolerated. The
league represents a majority of Republi

unanimously adopted, the committee then
adopted the following address:
PAN FRANCISCO. April IS, IDOO. !
To the Republican voters of the Fifth Con- |
RresPiunal IMstri''t of California â Citizens: ;
Under tli^ call Isaued by the executive of
the Republican National Committee, it Is
left to the discretion of the i'onjrression&l
districts to choose their own method of se
lecting delegates to the State nomination
conventions. Acting within this power and
discretion, the undersigned Republican Cbn
grreFsional Committee of the Fifth Con-
Krestlonal District decided that the delega
tion from said district to the Htate conven
tion, to be hold May IS, be chosen by ap
pointment, and in order that the selections
thuw made be a true refl?x of the staunch
Republicanism of the district. It invites
the assistance of every pood and honest
Republican by asking them to recommend
to the committee, for that purpose, - men
who enjoy their fullest confUt'enr* and In
whose party fealty there Is not the slight
est doubt!
In- thus departing from the old beaten
track of primaries, the committee was en
tirely actuated by the desire to prevent the
Republican ortranlzatlon of the district from
falling Into the hands of the old-time dis
reputable classes, and giving thereby our,
common enemy a weapon with which to*
club the party during the c.minfr campaign.
Could the Stratum law, with its effective
safeguards, be applied to the operations of
national party machinery, the committee
would certainly have been delighted to sub
mit the selection of delegates to the voters
of the district direct. Cut such Is unfor
tunately net the case. Kven the slight pro
tection which the old Porter primary law
placed around the ballot box is now, by rea- Â¦
eon of the adoption of the Stratton law,
withdrawn. The honest party man would
be entirely at the mercy of the hired ward-
Ftrlkers, thucs and the riffraff Â¦of society,
and It etands to reason that under such cir
cumstances a primary v.-ould degenerate
Into a mere farce. The first primary elec
tion held in this city under the Stratton
law was bo complete a success, and con
vinced the people bo thoroughly of the pos
sibility of an honest primary election, when
there Is a law to protect the voters, that
the decent people will henceforth turn with
loathing from a primary held under the frea .
Â«nd easy system of the old days. It were
indeed desirable would the next Legislature
bo amend the Stratton law as to make It
operative in the selection of delegates to
all conventions held within the limits ot
the State. Not only would the people obtain
their Just rights, but the Congressional, com
mittees would be relieved from the solemn
responsibility that now rests upon them.
Trusting the course adopted by the un
dersigned will meet the approval ' of their
fellow Republicans, we remain, rlncerely,

LEAGUE UP IN ARMS.
San Jose Republicans Will Rebel
Against Congressional Com
mittee's Action.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 19.â The - Republican
Good Government League, representing
nearly 2500 Republican voters of Santa
Clara County, will rebel at the high
handed work of the Fifth Congressional
District Committee in refusing the party
right to select delegates to the convention
at Sacramento which will select delegates
to the national convention. Two weeks
ago the league delivered the Republican
State Committee Its ultimatum that it
would not support any nominations from
this county that were appointed. This
threat will be carried Into effect. To
night's action of the Congressional com
mittee means the turning of the appoint
ment of delegates over. to the Rea.gang,
wihch the' league does not propose to tol
erate. From the. expression of members
of the. Congressional 1 committee this was
expected and last Saturday the Good Gov
ernment League appointed a committee of
five, with C. WV- Childs as chairman, to

arc, too, promised good food on steamers,
but on the Milos they were almost starv
ed. The cooks prepared the eternal rice,
sometimes with a few small fishes thrown
In, and heaped it boiling in big caldrons
on either side of the deck. The closely
packed Immigrants would fight for posi
tions near the caldrons, and when able
grab a handful of rice and would munch
it from their fists as they sat about the
decks. The Milos Is held here not only
because of the fact that her captain has
no clearance, but also as she has insuffi
cient boats. There are only four for a
thousand passengers. The steamer is in
a most filthy state, the scuppers being
piled up with evil smelling refuse.
Her officers report seeing a dismasted
wreck about a thousand miles from Flat

NEW SCHEME WORKED
BY ARIZONA CHINAMEN
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 19.â The United
States District Attorney of Arizona to
day received instructions from the At
torney General at Washington to cause
the arrest of a Chinaman named Lan
Wing Quong, who is now living at Tucson.
The case of this Chinaman is one of sen
sational interest. He came over from
China to San Francisco about March 1,
where, it is said, he attempted to land.
Falling In this he was taken in hand by
agents, who had been employed by his
father, a wealthy Chinese merchant in
Tucson, and given over to the Southern
Pacific road, which placed him in bond
for Mexico. The father was notified of
this action and when the Southern Pacific
train reached Tucson with the Chinaman
a writ of habeas corpus, which had been
issued by Judge George R. Davis of the
District bench, was served on the South
ern Pacific agent and the Chinaman was
delivered to the officers. The hearing on
the writ resulted In the discharge of the
Chinaman by Davis. The father claimed
that his son was born in Tucson and all
the Chinamen in Tucson who were friend
ly with the merchant gave evidence to the
same effect.
A number of white men who lived there
also said they thought they had seen the
boy in Tucson before. The case was
dropped and the Chinaman is now in
Tucson. It was the opinion of some of
ficials at the time that Judge Davis had
FIFTY THOUSAND JAPANESE ARE BOUND FOR PACIFIC COAST
EXAMINING ASIATICS ON
THE NIPPON MARU
Friends Are Kept Away From Then
and as Yet None Have Been
Landed.
The Chinese and Japanese coolies on thA
Nippon Maru had a quiet time of it yes
terday. After the hurry and rush of goin^
into quarantine at Angel Island, the trip
across the bay on the steamer Carolina
and the scramble to get aboard the Nip
pon Maru every one of the Asiatics was
ready for a rest.
Yesterday nearly all of them were re
hearsing the lesson they have to tell th's
Commissioner. On the dock were a num
ber of the pigtailed fraternity from
Chinatown, who wherever they got a
chance shouted to one or another of the
passengers, who would answer and then
quickly disappear. A number of Japanese
attempted to get aboard the steamer on
the pretext that they had relatives amons
the crew, but the customs officers Â»>re
obdurate and they had to remain ashore.
The work of examining the Japanese
began yesterday before the Immigration
Commissioner. The statements of quitf?
a number of men were taken, but so far
none of them have been landed. The tak
ing of testimony in the case of the Chi
nese will begin to-day, and after Th*
Call's expose it Is safe to say that the
evidence will be conclusive before a
coolie, be he merchant or native son. can
land.
In the pier over the entrance to thÂ»>
Mail dock there is another horde of Chi-'
nesp awaiting a landing. They are held
pending an appeal to the courts, and
should the 2OÂ» en the Nippon Maru bo
sent to join them it will be very close

Thirty-Three Japanese Deported.
Immigration Commissioner North re
ceived yesterday a dispatch from Com
missioner General Powderly. approved t>y
the Secretary of the Treasury, dismissing
the appeal of Kanichi Takumi and thirty
two other Japanese immigrants to whom
Mr. North had denied a landing-. Thin
decision closes the Incident and the Jap
anese will be deported by the next
steamer. The ground given by Commis
sioner North for denying the Immigrants
a landing Is that they arc contract la
