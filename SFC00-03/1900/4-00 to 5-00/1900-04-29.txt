THE SUNDAY CALL
I â¢ -^ .IX;Minstrelsy has !orsr reared to picture the
eccentricities of the plantation darky.
Brudder Bones and Tamho at the ends
m-tke all the fun. K p rit!emen In full even
ing suits and white kid gloves meander
in romantic grounds for cullings. even
venturing in operatic fields. Instead of
the sole accompaniment of the banjo,
there is a full orchestra. Specialties un
hea/d of in the early days of negro miT
strelsy are introduced in the present en
tertainment.
There were no female impersonators and
if a wench character was put on the most
comical man of the crew was selected.
To-day female impersonators draw the
largest salaries, for It requires art to
know where fan in petticoats stops and
bad taste besins.
Barney Williams was the fir3t burnt
cork female impersonator and won a repu
tation for his sketch cf "Lacy I.onsr."
His success led to Imitator's and' there
are a number of female impersonators to
day whose light tenor voices are good ac
companiments to the characters they as
sume. ,
The fortunes of minstrels are variable.
Dealing in fun and good humor, making
a merchandise of wit and comicalities,
they learn to brave life's ills v.ith forti
tude and before the footlights or minslinff
with the world are jovial and companion
able
Alive to a joke they are peculiarly sen
sitive to a slight. Frank Lynch, a capital
banjo-player, delighted in telling jokes to
amuse his companions while awaiting con
veyance from town to town. He took;
great pride in recalling when "h> was
with Harnr.m." One day a member of
the troupe handed him the life of Bamtnn
just published, remarking thai he had
mentioned Lynch in his autobiography!
The passage f*>ad: "Mere I picked up enÂ«
" Francis Lynch, an orphan vagabond."
The statement did not bear truth and
I..yncli to his dying flay cherished such ;t
hatred of the name of Barnum that none
dared mention the book in his presence
Ralph Kee!er. whep a lad. practiced so
violently "a w;:lk around and a hoe down"
In his room that he was turned out of tht>
boa rding-hou.se. He occupied an Import
ant position on thr minstrel stage when
hÂ»> left it to beeonte a distinguished scenic
arJist of California.
Negro minstrels have never attained tha
popularity of their burnt cork imitators
The varied experiences o f the minstrels
of early days is well illustrated by the his
tory Of Morris Bros., Veil & Trobrld'e
From lS**-Â«3 they occupied Ardway Hal>
In Beaton, opposite the Oid South Church
and enjoyed a run of popularity that
called forth the "standing room only"
card" as early as l:3u p. m. month after
month.
They have all been transported over the
Btyx, and two of them. Trobridge anti
Vfll. abandoned burnt cork In the inter
est of agriculture, dying farmers In good
circumstances. Lou Morris, who also ac
cumulated wealth, bought a race track,
and left a comfortable competence to his
family.
Billy Morris, who -wore diamonds in
firofuslon and carried a bag of the spark
ing gems in his pocket and took pride in
displaying them, died destitute In a
drunken fit in a gutter in Boston.
Another sad side of minstrelsy is em
phasized In the dramatic death of a onca
prominent burnt cork artist.
When Frohman was managing ITaver
ly's minstrels during their European
tour they met at Manchester a nonr
broken-down minstrel. Ben Iceland Ha

In IMI a band 'of five comedians and
musicians associated together in LtVnch

the place of interlocutor, which was then
as now a ready shaft for the end man's
wit. In addition to playing the banjo I.

STEPHEN C. FOSTER, author of
â¢â¢Old Folks at Home," was the in
stigator of minstnlsy. and the
quaint old plantation eong of "Jim

of "Burnt Cork TrouJjadors. "
In the year lv"ll v "l FoaterJ who -was a good
comedian and singer, was tilling en <n
ragement in Cincinnati. Passing to ana
firoxn rehearsals Ms attention was arrested
by a negro omnibus driver, why inces
santly sang:
Turn about and wlio<>l about ar.d do J'.s *o!
And every time 1 turn about I dance Jim Crow.
The catching words and melody made
puch an Impression that he hastened to a
t neater where IV. U. Rice was burlesqu
ing Scotch and Irish characters and sur
gested that he Jrarn the r-ong from the
negro, imitate his misfit clothing and
bnng it out as a new feature in his spe
cialty business. He secured the uitty. but
deferred its introduction.
Kice"s next engagement was in Pitts
l.urp. At Oriftitns Hotel he discovered
BXnong the attaches a negro who was a.
character. Kmploy^O in transferring bag
pace from the boats he enhanced his ex
chequer by letting the boys make a catch
penny treasury of his open mouth.
Hice at onro cultivated his acquaintance,
took him to the theater and bribed the
r.ejrro to direst himself of some of his
rags. Leaving him in the wings he donneu
the raiment and appeared at the foot
lights sMnpiiiff "Jim Crow." The dellghu-a
audience demanding an encore. Kice re
turned to repeat his song, when a voice
from the winfrs screamed lustily: "Oh,
Massa Kice. u<> give niggah his clo's!
Heah dat whistle ob dat boat? Ginger
Preferring to a rival sable porter* don t;et
ell df>m passengers for his hotel."
The suoct-ps of the new venture at the
Fifth-street Theater was heralded far and
near, and the music house of Peters &
Co. of Cincinnati published "Jim Crow,"
with an embellishment on the cover of
Kice !n costume.
The popularity of the "Father of Mln-
Ftreisy ' increased daily. The boy on his
vay la school whistled it; the plowman as
he turned his furrows in the oarth bade
hi* team "Turn about and wheel about
and do jfs so."
The lawyer's sanctum was invaded by
"Jim Crow," an<l tfc* merchant in his pri
vate office hummed "Wheel about and
turn about."
The demand for a wider field of this
kind of melody was iÂ«*cognizÂ«Â»d. "Old Vir

lowed "Jim Crow." and werÂ«- disseminated
throughout the land by the postman, then

It's one thing to eat the soups, salads
and other etceteras prepared by a moon
factl mandarin who presides over your
shining cookstove. It's another, matter
when it comes to dining "en famllle"
with your Chinese laundryman or your
Chinese gardener. Yet that is exactly
what Professor Jaffa did.
All sorts and conditions of people have
made .ill manner of dietary tests, from
living on raw vegetables to living on
Alger beef. Professor Jaffa himself has
made some very interesting experiments
on Infants" diet. However, others have
also studied alone: this line. But Profes
sor Jaffa is probably the only man in
college, or out. who fo.r three weeks broke
bread with the almond-eyed aristocrats
who "do tvashee velly cheap" and sell
v< Â£Â« tables "velly fresh, velly good."
Sam Lrng and Charlie Hop were the
gentlemen who played mine host to the
assistant professor of agriculture of the
State L'nlversltr. Professor Jaffa was
frequently accompanied by T. J. Snow,
who helps liim in his dietary experiments.
Mor-t people would be delighted to have
a college professor as a guest. Is'ot so
with Sam Lung and Charlie Hop. They
shook their round heads and blinked their
slant eyes, and without even a "velly
polly" they insisted that they would not
let Professor Jaffa share chopsticks with
them. This may have been the retort
courteous according to the Chinese Ches
terfields, but in the argot of the Berkeley
freshman, it was a "cold turn down."
Professor Jaffa was not to be daunted.
Tli" authorities at Washington had re
quested ihat if possible Professor Jaffa
make a study of the diet of the Chinese.
But the harder Professor Jaffa persisted
the mure Btroftgly Sam Lung and Charley
ji..ji resisted.*
They didn't want a "Mclican man" eat
ing rice with them, or riipbllng at 'the
other and strange articles that go to make
the Chinese menu: "Him professor come
to table, ail my washmen go on stiike."
said Sam Lung. In other words Sum
Lung's laundrymrn thought it beneath
their Oriental dignity to eat with a meru
college professor.
Charley Hop was a little more polity,
but equally firm. Charley runs' a large
vegetable garden in Berkeley, and the veg-

This organization had the proud dis
tinction of bring the first minstrel troupe.
The Boston Minstrels followed, with an
added member, who played the accordion.
The songs partook'of the camp-meeting
order, jubilee singing, imitation of roust
about music, as "Dey Floated Down the
Ohio." or "Lubly Louisiana Belle."
As the songs of the negroes wore full of
cheerfulness, even to their camp-rnecting
ditties, their Imitators copied the min
strelsy they were supposed to represent.
The programme of that day contained the
songs, "Dandy Jim of Caroline." "Miss
Lucy Long." "Old Dan Tucker," "Uncle
Lucy Lens," "Oh, Susanna."
P PROFESSOR M. Tl. JAFFA of the
I'nivorsity of California Is living
like a white man again. For three
weeks Professor Jaffa tried the diet
of John . Chinaman. Collejje pro
fessors are seldom gourmands, but
there are not many of them who would
voluntarily Inflict their palates with Chi
nese fare.
Professor Jaffa lias charge of the ex
periment station of Californ'a. The tflj-
Ject of thiÂ»>-e stations, which the Depart
ment of Agriculture at Washington has
*stablished throughout the United States.
1p to get data On the various food materials
and their nutritive and economic value.
The reports submitted by th<- experts are
published at Washington in. bulletin form
and are ihÂ«-n sent broadcast to colleges
and dietary students.
I-jiFt year the food experts met in San
Francisco. Few of our visitors leave us
â¢without carrying away some souvenir fof
Chinatownâ lrom a chopstick to a kimono.
These gentlemen? whose business It is to
analyze, weigh and compaie the food of
mankind, were more.. interested In the
food shop* of Chinatown than the joss
houses. The curious roots. Â«4UÂ«-er looking
vegetables and seeds fascinated them
more than the turn-ami of the Chinese
Theater or the link!- <>f the cups in the
tea house.
It has always been accepted ns true
that the Chinese are largely vegetarian
In their diet anÂ«l this apparently without
Ferinus detriment tÂ« their physical <1<Â»
veif'pmcni. Evidently their vegetables
*>.re the equivalent of the materials that
make u;i our own vegetable dietary and
presumably possess an intrinsic value for
such a purpose.
The visiting food experts were much
interested in the Chinese diet. The re
pult was that the authorities at Wash
ington ordered ;t report <Â»n the Chinese
vegetable foods, which was forthwith
prepared by Mr. Walter C. Blasdale. an
Instructor of chemistry at the University
nf California. This report gives the
analyses of the principal Chinese vege
tables found ia the Chinese quarter.
A description and analysis of the
Chinese vegetables by no means covers
the ground of the CblneM diet. So Profes
sor Jaffa prepared to make a study of tiie
food of rhÂ«- three classes of Chineseâ the
professional man. th<> man doing average
labor and the man doing; hard labor.
A Chinese <s>'niiM was elected as the

etables find their way to many a profes
sor's table. But why a professor should
want to come to his table was too much
for Charley's "sabe."
Then Professor Jaffa solvod the proh
lem. In the classic halls of learning at
Berkeley Is one Walter Fong-, a graduate
of Stanford University, and now doing
post-graduate work at Berkeley. Mr.
Fong has adopted American clothes,
taken an American wife and is- imbibing
all the knowledge that our two universi
ties otter to the student in mining engl
neeringfl For all that he has parted with
his. Mr. For.g comes from the land of pig
tails.
So Mr. Fong went to Sam Lung and
Charley Mop, and successfully pleaded the
professor's cause. They were convinced
that college professors are outside the
pale of "white devils," and that it is not
necessary to burn punk after their exits
and entrances*.
It was easy to initiate the Chinese den
tist into the mysteries of tabulating his
diet, but Sam l.ung and Charley Hop
needed some one at t!;eir elbows "to set
that it .was properly done. For unless
the data is absolutely correct any conclu
sions drawn therefrom would be value
less. Mr. Fong having given them the
"open sesame." Professor Jaffa, assisted
by Mr. Show; began his work.
After the first few days thÂ«- Chinamen
got used to having either Professor Jaffa
or Mr. Snow With them at meal time. The
"Melican men*' were there to tabulate the
food, but after a, day or two they were
asked to share it, and, according to both
gentlemen, some of the Chinese dishes
wero ?o tempting that they did not need
urging.
Both Sam Lung and Charley Hop. once
they understood the matter, "were inter
ested in the experiment and as Careful as
Professor Jaffa that tie nightly dietary
account should ho perfectly correct. Char
ley Hop, the Chinese gardener; confessed
that when first broached on the subject of
having an outsider watch his meals he
thought it was a scheme of the tax col
lector to tax them for all food consumed
over a certain tixed amount. "My men all
eat heap big. I always give them neap
plenty, so I much aflaid." he exclaimed.
AVhen convinced that the tax collector
had nothing to do with it Charley took
a most intelligent interest in the proceed
ings.
The dentist has such an Americanized
larder that it i. roves very little regarding
the Chinese diet. Following is a list of
the food materials used by the laundry
men and gardeners <iurin;; three weeks.
Many of th<rn sound strange to the Cau
casian car, and taste stranger yet to his
palate:
Lean pork and boef were the only
meats used: the other articles were tisti.
shrimps, fresh and dried: canned squid,
abalone, fresh and drie.J: bean cheese.
bean sprout?, vermicelli, rice, native cab
bage, dried Illy flowers, lotus roots, po
tatoes. Chinese radish, taro root.-*, water
chestnuts, dried fungus, algae and bam
boo shoots. In addition they consum B d
a small quantity of bread, butter and
supar and large quantities of tea.
Many of these articles need explanation.
The water chestnuts grow wild In China
and are sweet, juicy %nx\ resemble tha
chestnut in flavor. Taro root has about
the consistency of a sweet potato. 13 very
popular amors? the Chinese, and a num
ber of white people here, who have tasted
them in Chinatown, use them, at their
own tables.
Several species of fungi are used In
the Chinese dietary, the most popular nnÂ»
being yellow in color, except the top,
which is brown or purple. Two other
species of fungi are sold as delicacies, re
tailing as high as $2 per pound. Alga* iÂ«
also largely \;*t>t\. It looks like tangled
masses of horsehair, but when boiled
forms a gelatinous mass that is used for
thickening purposes, especially with dried
shrjmps.
The sacred lotus has many uses among
the Chinese, ranging from a toilet wash
and medical remedy to an article of food.
In San Francisco the Chinese use thÂ«
roots for the preparation of a kind of
starch and also boil them and eat thÂ»Â»m
raw as we ear salad.
F.ily leaves are considered a delicacy
anÂ«l are greatly relished.
. The young shoots Â«,f bamboo are also
considered very palataMo and are either
pickled in brine or canned.
Professor Jaffa is now at work compil
ing the data and making deductions there
from. As soon as he has finished the ma
terial will be sent to Washington and
printed. Professor Jaffa says that gen
erally speaking the Chinamen lived very
well compared to white people doing tba
same sort of labor. The amount of woris
they did. and their health, proves that
their dietary contained an ample amount
of nutrition.
A Sunday Ca!l reporter and photog
rapher accompanied Professor Jaffa and
Mr. Snow on the last day of their Visits
to Sam Long and Charley Hop. Sam Lun?
was visited at breakfast time a-d Charley
Hop at the midday meal. Bam received
the outsider courteously enough, hut t-.ls
workmen took decided exceptions to their
presence ar.d refused to sit down at th^
table until the new "white ghosts" tooit
their departure.
Charley Hop, the gardener, did not even
look askance at the camera, and whilo
Professor Jaffa and Mr. Snow piled chop
sticks with Sam lung and his nvn they
were photograplu-d.

for any significant circumstance. The
bridge was closed and the electric cars
running back and forth. While speaking
he was looking away to the north. Sud
denly his bright blue eyes lit up and he
turned quickly to the machinery.
"Scow coming," he said. .
Sure enough, it was a little two-sailed

was, however, it was Important enough to
command that big bridge to give trail. As

Charles Kingsley seems to have loved
every living creature around him. and he
taught hid children to respect even the
most loathsome insects. Mrs. Kingsley
tells how a fanjily of runaway toads made
their home in a hole of the green bank at
Eversley, and the scythe was never al
lowed to approach their retreat. He had
two little friends in*a pair of sand-wasps,
which lived in a crack of the window in
his drawing room, one of which he had
saved from drowning in a basin of water;
arid every spring he would look out eager
ly for them or their young, which came
out of, or returned to, the same crack.
He petted the white stable cat and the
black house cat. and sat up with a sick
dog during the last two nights of its suf
fering life. Wherever he went he was fol
lowed about the parish by his faithful lit
tle Dandy Dinmont, whose Intelligent face
was always to be seen at the lectures and
school lessons, and was known to every
cottager In the place-, being almost as
much esteemed by them as by the Kinga-

pulled out. I had a hard time with him.
I saw him going under the second timf
and I made a dive from the bridge. When
I got to him he tried to jerk away, and
even tried to kick and struggle while I
was dragging him out. When I got him
straightened out and the water pumped
out of him he cursed and said he would
have been all right without any interfer

â¢ "Once or twice I have had to jump in
after swimmers who lost their heads or
were taken with cramps. I recall one in

was an expert swimmer, came down to
the bridge to fish. I had often seen him
swimming about here, and when I saw
him slip and fall from the bridge I was

was for ten years.
Dogs, perhaps, have been pet* with a
greater number of famous persons than
any other animal. Every one Â¦will remem
ber Sir "Walter Scott's canine pets, of
which he had more than a score. Th^
most prized was the old Scotch hound
Malda, his companion for many years,
whose grave is near the gate at Abbots
ford, with the monument and inscription
that he de^ijrned for her. Then there werÂ«
the two pet greyhounds. Douglas and
Perry, which attended him everywhere.
They had a privileged place in his library,
one of the window* being left open in all
weathers, so that they might pas 3 in and
out when they pleased.
Lord Byron had a famous dos. Boat
swain, whose picture is still to be seen at
Newstead Abbey; and Hood's dog Dash
will be remembered as the one that Barry
Cornwall laid should have been named,
Hover. He accompanied Charles Lamb in
many of his walks, nearly worrying the
life out of the gentle essayist, who could
hardly manage to keep In sight of his
restless four-footed companion, and was
In constant terror lest he should lose him.
Walter Savage Landor was another
lover of dogs. He had a, number of them.
Partgl. which followed him in all hi*
tramps; (Jaillo, given to him by the sculp
tor Story, whose place was to He at his
feet, and, most celebrated of all, Pomero,
the little white Pomeranian dog that *va3
sent to him from Kiesole to Bath, wher*
he was then living. Kor twelve year*
Landor and his dog- were always together,
noticeable figures wherever they went,
nnd Pomero was written about and talked
about nearly as much as was his master.
Mary Russell Mltford was surrounded
by dogs from her childhood. To relate
her history would be to tell theirs HKe
wise, for they were inseparable. Their
qualities, troubles and general doings
have an important place In her letters,
and they have tender mention that might
lead one to % suppose them to be humÂ»-n
members of'the household. "All our pets
are well," 13 her usual message In cloa
ing, and many of them come in for spe
cial mention, like "Marmion and Mo.loo
and Moss Trooper, tho hounds"; "Mar's
with her black and glossy puppies": Mi
randa, from Stratford-on-Avon"; "May
flower and Mitl and Lufla, from the nor:h
countrie." and Dash, who "sends his re
spects to Mrs. Browning's doves," ani
was so well beloved by his mistress that
when she was in London homesick sh^
wrote to her parents. "I am dyinjr for
my Dash and my flowers."
Wordsworth's companion on his morn
tain rambles was a dog, for whoso death
he sincerely mourned and to whose mem
ory he paid an exquisite tribute in verse.
There have been other famous lovers of
dogs. Sir Edwin Landseer was especially
fond of them, and many of his pets he ha*
made to live again on the immortal cin
va*.
Mrs. Browning was greatly attached to
a silken-haired, hazel-eyed spaniel that
Miss Mltfortl gave to her. "Flushie" lives
in literature as the subjeel of onÂ© of his
mistress' tenderest poems.
Goethe hated dogs; his pet was a ltvÂ»
snake, which he kept in a chimney cor
ner, a repulsive companion one would
think. The pet of Tiberius, the Roman
Emperor, was also a snake; yet the twa
men were wholly unlike in every partic
ular.
Jean Paul Richter's pets were a mouse,
a squirrel and a white spider. Hogarth.
the painter, was fond of cats, and at his
home at Chlswick he had a garden wherÂ«
he buried his favorites, placing little tab
lets to mark the spot and distinguish the:r
individual sepulchers.

There would come first a little fright
ened cry. a splash, then the urchins -could
yell "kid overboard." and In a moment
Mr. Emlay was in the water. Never once
was he too late. Often the little fe'lows
were dragged out unconscious, but Mr.
Emlay carried them to his room in the
tower, rolled them, poured stimulants
down their throats, and worked over them
until he brought them to. Then they
were wrapped in blankets, and when their
clothes were dry enough, wetter but
v.iser little men. they were trundled back
to their distracted mothers and thereafter
"hang your clothes on the hickory limb,,
but don't go near the water," dinged Into
their ears.
"Most of them told me their names,"
paid Mr. Emlay. There was one little
fellow, though, who said "Gee, mister, I
can't tell, 'cause 'f I did mother'd find
it out 'n' I'd catch it. I never kept
a list of them, so I've forgotten their
names.
"There was one little chap, though, that
I'll never forget. I noticed him down
here several times and chased him away
each time. I always tried to play bogie
man of the bridge and keep youngsters
away from it. It was not hard to frighten
away the little girls, but the little boys
were not so easy. This one little chap
kept coming back, and fell In like most of
the others, only â only he did it purpose-
Mr. Emlay told the story of the little
chap. It isn't pleasant to think of a ten
yr-ar-nM lad so tired of his young life
that he tried to end it. His name was
Jim, and his father was a sea captain
Failing somewhere on the ocean's blue.
Jim's mother had died at sea when he
was born, and Jim was brought to Oak
land and given to a "kind-hearted widow
lady," who lived up to her advertisement
by beating Jim for her daily exercise.
"Somewhere down under the water was
his mother, somewhere on * the billows
rode his father's ship, and surely the tide
would carry his body to one or the other"
thought little Jim, so overboard he fell.
When ho had been nsiieu out, pumped
dry and thawed out. he told his story.
The next port that sea captain put into
he found a letter from Mr. Emlay, and
the next foreign-bound ship that left this
harbor carried Jim to his father's arms.
Mr. Emlay did not. confine himself en
tirely to savins? runaway children. "There
were a number of men," said Mr. Emlay,
"and two or three I have reason to be
lieve did not fall in accidentally. .Then
there were others who were 'half seas
over* before they ever wandered down to
thÂ« drawbridge.
"One old fellow who Jumped over and
was rescued Is living yet. I meet him
frequently on the street, and there is al
ways a peculiar expression on his face
when he sees me. I pretend not to recog
nize him, because I do not wish to re
mind him of it, but he always knows mo
and tries to avoid me. He was not quite
sober that night. I have fished out other
fellows who came dcrwn here 'just to let
the night air blow on their heads.' ''

that's why Oakland thinks that tha
brightest medal Congress can turn out Is
due Charles Emlay.
WtTT probably
THERE are thirty lives charged tip
in the Book of Life to Charles Em
lay. Thirty souls that his strong
arm enatched back from the jaws
cf death out Into God's sunshine
from the Fhades of suicide.
Thirty lives lias Charles Emlay saved,
thirty times has he played the game of
chaneo with life and death and always
with the odds In favor of death. Thirty
time's };as he risked his own life that oth
ers might live.
You â¢will find this thirty-ply hero at his
post In thp high tower that dots the draw
bridge which spans the Oakland estuary.
Ho t:11 tell you th3t he Is not a hero at
all. that It Is his business to control the
drawbridge. Time was when the draw
brMge was an old-fashioned ftoam-run
nlng affair, every "choo-choo" of which
was a menace to the human freighted
cars which passed over It. One day a
train plsinged Jnto the yawnlnsr chasm
which the inefficient drawbridge had left
open. Then the present modern electric
drawbridge was built, and Charles Em-
Jay's opportunities of playing the human
life-saver were lessened.
The nest txvn year? will not duplicate
the record of the last two years. Charles
Emlay will not have to stand sponsor for
thirty more human beings saved from
watery graves. The railing on the new
r'rawbrldjre handicaps the suicidal and
fsvcs the unwary from slipping into the
Â¦waters below. But If Congress turns a
willing f^r *Â°> the petition of the Oakland
Merchants' Exchange Uncle Sam will give
Chnrles Emlay a medal for the saving of
thirty of his citizens. It will glisten on
the wall of the drawbridge tower, and he
who runs may read how In the days of the
rid drawbridge one man cheated the
greedy waters of thirty victims. For
two years Charles Emlay worked on the
old drawbridge, ar.d during that time he
rescued ns many drowning souls as there
are months In the years, with six extra
for Sundays and holidays.
Tru'.y this Is a record to be proud of
*md in his pecret heart Charles Umlay is
prc-ud of It, for all that he will tell you Is
be la cot a hero. The business for
Â¦which he was raid was to manipulate the
Â£rawbr!dye end not to hurriedly throw off
h'M coat and plungre Into the water. Tis
Â£eep ar.d dark and horrid there where the
Â¦waters flow, ar.d It took a strong arm
end ftoutcr heart to dive o!T the four
teen-foot bridpp, plunge In and grapple
Trlth the drowning. So whether he will
or not Oakland pl.ices Charles Emlay high
on her lift cf heroes. .

forth Mr. Emlay's aquatic prowess. Not

of the water traffic, When they blow
three whistles we open up the bridge and

Story of Christian Science.
Stanley Waterloo, who wrote "The
Story of Ab." has published a novel, "The
Seekers." in which are weighed in the
balanceâ and found wantingâ the preten
tior.s of Christian Scientists and others of
Uir.Ured faithâ the "truth serkers" of the
book to pese as truth finders. In the
novel, the devotees of the "new thought "
are divided into two class* sâ those who
are ho.ientin their belief, but in whom all
sympathy for human sorrow ti-ens dcad
er.<-d ty trust in the theory of the non
reality of nain, ar.d those who make pro
fession of the new faith serve as a schema
lor money-making.
Mr. Waterloo, to be sure, does r.ot tell
us whether the science attracts disagree
able people or whether unpleasant quali
ties are developed* by the religion in Its
adherents. AÂ« an unprejudiced inquiry
into the value of Christian Science; tho
boi;k is .scarcely convincing, though read
for its story it is possibly entertaining.
The heroine. Kate Vaughn, a successful
woman of business in Chicago, brings
from her home in the country her young
sister, Narcissa, who is out of health.
Narcissa, having been under the care cf
a physician, without deriving benefit from
his ministrations, next tries what a hc-aier,
Mrs. Clay, can do for her. Finding Mrs.
Clay a failure, Narcissa joins the classes
of Dr. Zadski, the teacher of a system
Â«.f philosophy,' which he calls "Truth."
and v.hich he pretends to have originated.
Kate, ltarful of the Influence which Zad
ski is gaining over Narcissa and suspect
ing it to te harmful to her Eister, also
joins Zadski's classes to see If she can
counteract this Influence. However, Kate
herself succumb^ somewhat to Zadskt's
fascination. When the latter leaves town
for his summer vacation, Narcissa disapp
ears. Kate-, in despair, unable to trace
her sister, seeks aid lrom her lover; John
Yule, from whom s-he has been estranged
on account of the lack of sympathy he
shows fer Kate's new faith. \ule finds
Kardzsa in the South In v colony founded
by Zaelski, and then telegraphs for Kate,
who arrives only in time to receive her
dyinfr sister in her arms. After Narcissa's
death. Kate, hating the syste-m of philos
ophy which she believes to have been an
swerable for her sister's loss, turns from
it to the old religion of her childhood.

"Barbara pritfcehie."
Clyde Fitch, not willing to let a play
able p!ay rest on its laurels won behind
footlights, must needs issue It between
covers.
The story of Barbara Frletnhle is based
upon Whittler's poemâ that is to say, the
Hag-waving climax is. in other respects
there is little resemblance. Barbara is
described as "a ravishing young crea
ture," instead of the elderly person we
have known since we used to "speak
pieces." The other characters are also
new to us. But "the author disclaims any
intention to the wilting of an historical
play," and "he has endeavored merely to
picture of an imaginary eto'ry some of the
spirit and atmosphere of a certain period
of our history."
For stage purposes he has done all that
be assumes to do. and hu who reads wim
lems of city government. The theme of
which Comptroller Coler has written is
therefore one on which a notable work
might be founded, but the volume he has'
given us is utterly Inadequate. It does
not even explain the form of government
the new charter provides. The various
papers i were doubtless Interesting when
they v.'*re published In magazines or
delivered as lectures, for they were then
timely to some issue occuping public at
tention. They are not BO interesting In a
book, and are far too, sketchy and slight
to be accounted valuable. The subjects
dralt with are: "The City Charter,"
"Public Charily," "Charity Regulated/
"Income and Expenses,'.' "Water Supply,"
"Transportation," "City Development."
"The Church In Politics" and "Political
Machines." These are all good topics, but
in not one single case has the Comp
troller given us anything more serious
than a liffht review suitable for the casual
magazine reader. ("Municipal Govern

"Through fira to Fortune."
Mrs. 1 Alexander Is too well known as a
writer of bright, readable books to need
a word of commendation. Her latest
work, "Thro" Fire tc Fortune." will not
prove a disappointment, for. although It is
inferior to her work at its best, there, is
about it a freshness of touch and a mod
errity of treatment which will appeil par
ticularly to the younger class of novel
readers! The plot Is a hackneyed one. but
the heroine is distinctly likable and the
hero has the necessary amount of fasc.'.na

the book If not in an exacting mood. (R.

The pree Trade Movement.
One of a series of volumes designed to
deal with the principal features of the
Victorian era in Great Britain is ,"The
Free Trade Movement and Its Results,"
by G. Armiiage-Smith, principal of the
Blrbeck Institution and lecturer for the
London Society for the Extension of Uni
versity Teaching.
The work is much more of a plea for
free trade than an impartial record of
history. In his preface the author says:
"The old controversies still remain and
have, in fact, been renewed with fresh
vigor, partly owing to the persistence of
the United States and other countries In
a protective policy, and also to the move-

The City Problem.
Under the title "The City Problem." Al
bert A. llgskln presents a city puzzle
ar.d a solution thereof that ought to have
been cast in the form of n Utopian novel.
or n chapter from the philosophy of Pes
simism. Mr. Hoskin can cÂ»rry his theo
ries straight through more contacting
facts than any man that has ever written
on municipal problems. He says the city
Is an established factor in social economy;
that the genius of tho city is corrupt and
that it must be purified or perish. The
man who does not work should not be al
lowed to eat whether he be a tramp or a
millionaire. Mr. Hoskin continues, and
that law is violated in the city. The city
Is a non-producer and the rural districts
aro taxed to support it, and along with
the city they have to support also the
city slum. Moreover, the city is destruct
ive of the home. It divides its people Into
two classes, one of which has mansions
larger than the owners can occupy and
the other has no home at all. Then. the
city Is unsocial, for, says Mr. Hoskin.
"sociality is democratic, but society is
aristocratic, it is autocratic. It is pluto
cratic, it is royalistic. And all this Is un
natural, unbrotherly and cruelly unkind."
Finally the conclusion is reached that we
can never find an ideal social compact
within a city, and therefore the solution
of the city problem Is to abolish the city.
Mr. Hoskin* proposes* that every family
shall have forty acres of land to . live
on, and be made to live on it. That would
enable the people to live near enough to
gether to have sociality, or as the author
puts It: "We would in such manner reach
the result of stimulation without conges
tion; of emulation without envy; of am
bition without contention; " of aspiration
without greed, and of combination with
out competition." ("The City Problem,"

Mr. Moffett yper.t some weeks with Tls
.Â«ot last summer at his home in Frince,
and gained a better insight into this com
pltx artlxt'fl nature than most of the
Frenchman's admirers have obta-r.efi.
T!ssot has been called a realist, and no
doubt he pushes Ills paintings to almost
photographic accuracy, but he is more
than a rtaiist. h* is something very dif
ferent from b realist, a seer of visions ar.d
a cirearr.er ol dreams.
Mr. MofTett reates several conversations
in Which Tissot. With gravest conviction.
acknowledges his indebtedness to a certain
Sister Kathirine for tlata in various
Kcnea of Christ's Hf^- For example, ct
the time of the crucifixion it ts known that
Mary stood somewhere betwem the crosa
arid "the garden of Joseph of Arlmathea.
Tradition says there were three terrace 1 *
on the 1 ttle hill of Calvary. Dili she stand
on the tirst of these, or on the second, or
on the third? In the absence of all his
torical knowledge on this point. Tissot ap
peals confidently to Sister KaTherine.
"Tell me. my sister," he said one day.
"if Mary stood on tho third terrace, the
one nearest to the garden?"
"Oh no " said Sister Katherin**. cj'ilta
confidently; "the Blessed Mother stood on
the second terrace. Many, many times I
have seen her there and watched with her
to the end."

Mur>xipal Government.
Bird S. Coler. Comptroller of the city
of Xew York, has compiled a series of
papers dealing with some of the salient
features of iho administration of that
city under its now chartor. Most of the
chapters In the book were prepared orig
inally .is articles for reviews or a3 lec
tures. Consequently the work does not
tive anything like a satisfactory account
of the subject. Municipal administration
is at the present time one of the most in
teresting of political topics to the Ameri
can peopie. and the experiment in thHt
form of government which has been un
dertaken in Greater New York is the most
important venture which has yet jeen
made in this country in solving the prob-
ment for federation with our colonies,
most of which are committed to protec
tion." It is therefore as a contribution
to an existing controversy rather than
as a review of the controversies of tho
past that the work has been written.
Those who look to It for a comprehensive
account of the great agitation in Kngland
which resulted in the overthrow of the
corn laws will be disappointed. It deals
with that agitation, it is true, but the
standpoint of the writer is that of a par- 1
tisan, and his purpose has clearly been
that of refuting the arguments of the free
fair traders who are now increasing in
number in Great Britain rather than of
composing a book which would be accept
ed by all parties as a correct history of
one of the most notable events of the Vic
torian age.
A slncle pasfage from one of the early
speeches of Cobden will serve to show
why free trade ha 3 been adopted by the
British and why the corn laws were re
pealed. Addressing the Commons, he
said: "I am neither a Whig nor a Tory.
I am a free trader. Under the corn laws
the family of a. nobleman pays to the
bread tax about one halfpenny on every
300 pounds of income, while the tax takes
from the income of the family of a labor
ing man about 20 per cent." Of course, a
monstrous tax of that kind upon a neces
sary of life could not be maintained In a
free country, and it was repealed. Pro
tection in the United States does not en
tail a bread tax nor impose such unjust
burdens upon tho laboring man. It Is, on
the contrary; a benefit to him, since it
builds, up industries which provide him
witli work and wages.
The wide difference which exists be
tween the conditions of the United States
and of Great Hritaln affords ample expla
nation why a fiscal system. injurious m
the one country can be advantageous to
the other. Professor Armltage-Smith,
however, is an intense partisan on the
subject and undertakes to maintain thai
free â¢ trade is right everywhere, that all
the nations of Europe and America are
wrong and that Great Britain alone ha 3
the true light. Ho has made an Interest
ing work and those who wish to go over
again the old controversy that raged
around the tariff issue in this cpuntry
during the Cleveland administration will
find the work worth reading. ("Tho Free
York, is devoted to the history of official
Washington. It contains excellent pic
tures, in half tone, of the United States
Senators now serving, the respected mem
bers of the Supreme Court, a group photo
graph of Mrs. McKinley surrounded by
the "Ladles of the Cabinet," and specially
posed pictures of the President and his
Cabinet. In addition are given valuable
and authentic biographical sketches and
data of importance. The publishers have
taken up a new and Interesting field, and
from the superior results thus far at
tained merit the success which will un
doubtedly be theirs.
Concerning Mexico.
"Guide to Mexico" is the title of a
bandy little text of some 12T pages from
the pen of Christobal Hidalgo,. Besides a
map and excellent photogravures illustra
ting the character and life of the country,
the book contains detailed information up
on every point likely to be of valua to an
Amorlcan contemplating a visit to Mex-co
cither for business or pleasure. It com
prises statistics, the agricultural re
sources of the country, descriptions of its
cities and railroads, possibilities of em
ployment in different branches of labor,
and points of interest for the sightseerâ
altogether a quite valuable and handy lit
tle volume. (The Whitaker & Ray Com
pany, San Francisco, $1.)
â¢'Autobiography of a Cu^cK '
'.'The Autobiography of a Quack" is a
psychological study of a man who is more
rogue than quack in the common accepta
tion of the term; for we do not usually
symbolize by "quack" downright villainy,
and Dr. Mitchell has taken for his subject
the description of the character of one
who is- the embodiment of degeneracy and
whose life opposes the theory that envi
ronment is able to overcome the evil en
dowments of nature. Dr. Sandcraft. the
quack, engages in practice of all kinds
of nefarious work, sometimes led on by
love of pain, and again Induced to gratify
some passing, impulse.. His methods are
all dishonest, and as they are employed
by a clever man, who is mentally ami
physically the opposite of weak, the sym
pathies of the reader are not engaged
in his behalf. Indeed, It la with a feel
ing ot distrust, us well as of pleasure.

that on<> rises from a perusal of Dr.
Mitchell's bookâ distaste on account of
the unvaried rascality of the leading char
ter and pleasure given by the skill of the
author In clothing with interest the ex*
plolts of even a precious rogue.
In the same volume is the imaginary
rnsc of Richard Dedloe, nr army surgeon,
who loses his limbs in the war of the re
bellion. V
The case excited a grbat deal of atten
tion and sympathy when the article ap
peared in the Century, and a number of
subscriptions were sent to the "Stump
Hospital." It was then that Dr. Mltcheil
confessed that ho had written up the case,
not having Intended it to fall into the
hands of the publishers, which it did
through h friend.
The descriptions of Dedloe's sensations
aro painfully vivid. not only where he lose 3
his limbs, one by one, but after he has be
come a "stump."
The story Is not pleasant reading to one
who. Is affected by horrible pictures, sticr*
as could alone oomo from the pen of one
who, like Dr. Mitchell, has been a lifetime
in Katherins such data, but it la certainly
fascinatingly weird. (The Century Com

Guide to Paris."
Laird & Lpe of Chicago have just issued
an eighth edition of their Guide to Paris,
which is to all purposes an entirely new
book, to be known henceforth as "Lee's
Standard Guide to Paris." This work
was successful from the start, but in its
present form it is undoubtedly the best
guide of the size ever published on either
side of the Atlantic. Its main new feature
is a Eeries of twelve city routes, with dia
grams, covering every possible point of
interest in the great city, and giving
crisp, accurate descriptions of all monu
ments, public buildings, churches, the
aters, museums, bridges, parks, etc. These
routes have taken the experienced Paris
ian author months of close study, as his
ambition was to give the tourist a chance
to see everything and miss nothing, while
covering the ground in a minimum of
time. A second novel feature introduced
in the" book i 3 v short vocabulary of words
and sentences in German and Italian that
will prove most valuable to tourists visit
ing Switzerland, Germany, Austria or
Italy after or before their trip to Paris.

Stanley Waterloo's new novel. "The

tribute from Dr. Dowlc. This eminent
preacher, who claims to have performed
miraculous cures and holds crowds en

Mr. Waterloo has therefore abandoned

Long after Lea had finished the book
she remained in thought, leaning on the
window sill. The afternoon recreation
was over. The evening study and classes
had begun in the rustling silence of the
big buildings. The pupil who had been
copying in the neighboring room from tli
see Reclus' booK a short time before had
gone. The library was empty. By insen
sible degTees the June twilight was slowly
dying away. The steeple of St. Charles'
Church stood out darkly, precise and yet
obscure, like a silhouette cut in blacU
paper, acainst the background of a sky
like mother-of-pearl. Lea. standing there
motionless, had only, one thought, attenu
ated and dim.
She remembered vaguely a pointed stee
ple piercing the opalescent sky on the hor
izon at Richmond. Now that she had rin
ished her book she felt intoxicated by
what she had read, as by some drugged
beverage. The real and the imaginary
were indistinguishable, and the confusion
wa.s rialnful to her. William and Nora
were Geore and herself capricously meta
morphosed by Tinka's intuitive art. and
she had further complicated her person
ages by attributing to them the strange
and rebellious suggestions of her own con
science. Lea mechanically replaced the
book in her portfolio and left the library.
As Kcon as she attained the corridor the
Llnze of light from the electric globes
hurt her eye?, as though she had been
nwaitened suddenly. She had to stop and
Jean against the wall for support. A sen
sation of eiddiness seemed to make the
luminous line in the middle of the ceiling
ppin round her. A hand was laid upon
her arm.
"What is the matter. Lea? Are you
ill?"
She raised, h*Â»r eys and recognized Daisy
Crag-?:?. She drew a deep breath.
"No. Daisy," she. said, "it is nothing. I
stopped too long in the library reading
near the window, and the light in the cor
ridor dazzled my eyes. It is nothing, you
ccc: nothing!"
She took a few steps that were at first
rather uncertain, leaning on the Irish
Â¦woman's arm. Then she liberated herself
and walked along side by s!df v.-ith her.
Daisy watching her companion's face with
affectionate anxiety. She shook her head.
"You are not very well. Lea. I told
Pirnitz and your sister that you ought to
take v little holiday and go away for a
short time from this place."
"I shall have a vacation like all of you"
replied Lea. smiling, "when the pupils
take theirs."
Mile, de Salnte-Parade talked of rent-
Ing a house at the seaside or in the
country during the months of August and
Septemberâ a house where the mistresses
m:|?ht stay with those of the pupils who
had no relatives or whose family would
allow them to go.
Daisy CrapK's Hp moved as though she
were about to speak, but she restrained
the Impulse and said nothing. Her sister
Edith had told her the story of Lea and
GeorÃ Orsten. Although she was op
posed to the dominant sex and had been
simerely happy and tranquil in her celi
bacy since she had enjoyed Germaine's
vivifying presence, she would willingly
have scolded Ix>a in a friendly fashion.
"What! You are still th-nking of that
dar.dy who w<\3 nmiising himself in Italy
while you were weeping for him!" But
she was tao charitable and too kind
hearted to run the risk of paining her
companion. "Besides," she thought, "I
don't understand these love stories."
"Have you heard the news?" she paid
in order to change the subject, as. having
descended the staircase, they were going
to their rooms.
"What news?"
"There is an article attacking us In the
Eemalne de St. Charles, the little journal
which is said to be directed by the Abbe
Minot."
"Attacking us? '
"Yes. Mile. Heurteau lent it to me a
few moments ago. I glanced through it.
We are not mentioned Individually, but
the methods nnd the instruction of the
school are condemned, with a few reser
vations and compliments in honeyed
P " r wtmt do they reproach us with?"
Â° S She onV asked" hy mere habit and by
the acquired force of her former apos
tolic ardor. As a matter of fact, she had
become completely indifferent to all mat
ters relating to the school. The earnest
tone of her own voice asking the ques
tion astonished her; it resembled an In
voluntary hypocrisy which she desptsed.
while Daisy was telling her or trie ob
jections made by the Abbe Minot to "a
ivstem of education that is half Protest
ant and half atheistic, a cosmopolitan,
anarchical tendency, the sullying of
youthful imagination by indiscreet hysri
enic lessons, the lack of modesty in the
Instruction Riven, the openly professed
horror of marriage."
The two women arrived at the door of
Lea's room. The young girl listened with
secret impatience, her hand on the door
knob Her dizziness was gradually dis
appearing, leaving in her brain two
vaguely aching spots as^ though caused
by ft double blow.
"Protestants! Protestants!" cried Daisy
Indignantly. "I am as good a Catholic as
ho is. the dirty old caasocked scribbler!
If my father had not been a Catholic he
would never have been driven from his
farm like a dot: when I was only ten
years of age! Protestants. Indeed!"
She went away still muttering. this epi
thet, which ruffled the hereditary fiber of
a persecuted race in her. Lea entered her
room. Frederique was dressing for suo
per, according to the custom cf the
school; where even the pupils were led to
the lavatory before meals and came to
table with clean hands and fa<*e^, the? I 
hair in order and their clothes well
brushed. Frederique was arranging her
heavy tresses of dark hair before the mir
ror of the wardrobe. LÂ«Â»n loofced at her
for a moment before closing the dx>or.
"How beautiful she is!"
And the two aching points In her hraln
immediately became more painful. With
out turning Frederique asked:
"Is that you. dearest? Where have you
been all afternoon? I have been looking
for you."
"I was in the library lookin? through
some albums by Viollet le Due."
The half falsehood caused her no confu
sion. For a long time the former com
plete communion between the two sisters
had changed Into a discreet reserve.
"While Fredertque, observing her sister
secretly, related the effect produced upon
the general staff of the tchool by the arti
cle in the Semalne de St. Charles. Lea.
having taken off her bodice, cooled her
face and her milk white arms In the cold
water, and then, letting down her chest
nut hair and leaning backward, she began
to brush it and arrange it afresh.
Frederlque'a words made clear to her
the meaning of the double pain In her
brain. She began to understand what was
the double shock that Tinka's story had
caused her. It had aroused her Jealousy
against her elder. With a sort of moody
certainty. Lea now attributed the senti
ments of the Imaginary Julia to the actual
Fredertque. The other shock was this
fearâ Georg was HI: Georg was dying, like
William in the book!
Tlnka, by an artistic caprice, had given
Lea's soul to the hero of her novel, but all
"William's love adventure was really that
of Georg, and the story of his return to
England read like a faithfully written
diary. Since the novelist told of his ill-

Pirnltz herself admired Lea's tranquill
ity, the calm, tireless activity with which
she accomplished her daily task. But Pir
nitz, so accustomed to read the human
heart, was mistaken. In the fullness of
her hope she said to herself: "Lea has
recovered control of herself." Lea even
deceived herself.
"Oh. Vanderbrouck, your drawing is
very poor. Stand up for a moment."
She took a glass of clean water, dipped
the brush in it and prepared the colors,
her graceful profile bent over the sheet of
paper buckled by the humidity*. But while
she handled the brush and pointed out the
faults to the pupilâ a fair-haired girl, with
a narrow forehead, big blue eyes and
wide-open mouth â she had only one
thought, a thought that little by little be
came painful as a wound. Her mind dwelt
on the book brought in a few moments be
fore by the little monitress, the book she
had refused with such apparent indiffer
ence, and which was now lying upon the
table on the platform.
She had cast a glance at the book, a
single glance, when Alexandrine offered It
to her. She has seen two things with a
shockâ the small, black, clear type of the
English paper wrapped round it. and the

meet her lover she went along the corri
dor quickly and up the two flights of
stairs. Upon the landing of the first she
met Germaine Soubize.
"Oh, Lea, Duyvecke has written to me!"
the slender young, rea-halred girl said to
her as they passed each other.
Ah! What does she say?"
"Little Remineau has had a relapse.
This time It is a veritable attack of mu
cous fever, unmistakably defined. She
dare not leave him. She says If he were
to die in her absence she would feel that
she had killed him."
"Well?"
"She Is stopping with him."
â¢Without any further exchange or con
fidences the two girls went on, each in
her own direction. Lea, while walking
toward the library, remembered the con
fusion created among 1 the members of the
general staff of the school the day before
by Duyvecke's absence. They had tried
to hide their confusion, and no one dared
to discuss it. They even pretended that
Duyvecke had acted wisely. "She could
not let the. little one die through her
fault.". In her place they would all have
acted as she had done,
But each of Duyvecke's companions
asked herself In secret. Will she return?
The uneasiness created by this defection,
the first that had occurred since the
foundation of the school, was Increased by
a vague fear of the financl.il embarrass
ments of Mile, de Salnte-Parade. by the
emotion, due to the Inspector's visit and
his pronounced hostility. Lea thought, as
she walked along: "Duyvecke is guided
by fate. In spite of herself she will re
main at Remineau's and will marry him.
She pulled herself up in her thoughts by
an effort of will. She was afraid of com
paring herself to Duyvecke. Did she hope
for a similar constraint, for a pressure
upon the part of Destiny that would also
liberate her? Â«
The echool library occupied three me
dium-sized rooms upon the second floor,
lined with shelves and furnished with a
few bamboo armchairs. Most of the
books were Dauer-backed. Ud to the

present there had been no money to
b:nd thorn. They came from Pir
nitz's o!d library and increased by
gifts from each of the foundresses,
and, above all, by a fine collection
t>f classical authors taken from Mile,
de Sainte-Parade's residence; for, as
.Mile, de Salnte-Parade never read a
line, she had offered them to the
school. In each room there was a
window opening upon the square,
planted with chestnut, trees, which
formed the other side of the Kue
Delornel. They w<:e b:-.y windows,
with a little bench running around each
one.
When Lea came In two of the three
rooms were empty: in the third a pupil
was copying out of the "Universal Geog
raphy," by Reclus. Lea sat down on a
bench in one of the windows. Evening
was slowly descending. An orange col
ored light gilded and reddened the top*
of the trees, the roofs in the Rue Delor
nel and In the neighboring Rue St.
Charles, and the pointed steeple of the
church. Lea recnlied 5n ber memory an
evening at the beginning of summer sim
ilarly glorified by a reddish sunset. It
was in Surrey, after a day spent with
Georg. About the same hour they had
stopped at a little old-fashioned English
inn, the Rutland Arms, to take afternoon
tea.
Yes, a similar orange hadrblushed the
light atmosphere that evening, and the
tenacious memory of the eyes suddenly
reanimated all the souvenirs, all the pic
tures of that happy period. The past rose
up victoriously before her, moro real than
the unreal. Indifferent present. Was not
all that had happened since then a con
fufed dreamâ their return to France, the
two "attempts made by Georg to win his
betrothed, the long months spent in the
school in a state of artificial exaltation?
It seemed to Lea that another person had
usurped her. thoughts and her Mfc! To
day time and space were annihilated, and
she seemed to reconquer her former per
sonality! She became again the joyous
traveler pouring out the steaming tea for
Georg Ortsen in the little parlor of the
Rutland Arms, lit up by the orange rays
of the sunset.
She heaved a sigh for freedom. Open-
Ing her portfolio, she took out the book,
untied the string without haste, unfolded
a number of the Bristol Herald in which
It was wrapped, and, comfortably in
stalled in the corner of the window, began
to read.
It was a cheap .eighteen penny edition
of an English novel, entitled "William
Powell's Two Sisters: translated from the
Finnish of Tlnka Ortsen, by Mrs. Irving
Clarke." It was bound 'in cardboard,
with a design, in tawdry colors, at once
loud and tasteless, so inartistic was their
juxtaposition. It represented a woman
sitting on astono bench with a man at
her feet.
Lea examined the first page, thinking
she might find some Indication as to its
origin, perhaps a little dedication. But
the page was blank; not a single word
was written upon it. . â¢ '
"One of the most varied and picturesque
fiarts of England for travelers Is cer
ainly the county of Derbyshire, near the
old thermal station called. Buxton, where
Queen Anne formerly went to take the
baths." .
Lea read and reread this phrase me
chanically. It seemed to her quite de
void of sense. She had never been to
Derbyshire. She had never heard of Bux
ton, and then her very deception made her
realize that she had expected to find the
As for Nora, this is how the author de
scribed her:
"She hud this peculiarity, her soul seem
ed to te almost always sleeping, as slum
bers a little child. It was a calm and
peaceful sleep, probably more peaceful
thnn its vigils; tor, when awakened, it
displayed a keen desire to enjoy life, to
be moved by powerful sensations. And
as she did not know how to procure, these
sensations. Nora would sit at the piano
for hours; for hours she would woo art
to give her peace. And, fatigued by its
own exaltation, Nora's soul would fall
asleep again."
Nora had a sister named Julia. In de
scribing her the author had certainly
used Frederiquc as a model. But she had
drawn a Northern Frederique, harshei,
more rigid, than the original one.
"Julia and Nora," continued the book,
"were born in Finland, where the Creator
seems to have measured parsimoniously
all the joys of warmth and light und
where for six months in the year
one might say that nature la
dead. Like the plants and the
trees, they had only learned half of
life, t And yet, though, they thought they
lived, a vague inner conscience warned
them that one day they would live more
fully, more intensely. They did nothing
to hasten that awakening. And as there
was no i disturbing element in their sur
roundings that awakening could only take
place owing to the development of their
own conscience."
The tragic, conscientious scruple which
really drove. ' the Herstens from Finland
had been Ingeniously changed and jitll-
Izcd. Julia and â¢ Nora discovered that
their father and mother were not mar
ried, that their mother's real husband was
still alive, that, she had left him almost
immediately after their marriage to live
with a lover, and that Julia and Nora
were born of this union!
Bereft of respect tor their mother, they
dared not beg her to return to the path
of duty, so the two young girls preferred
to leave the paternal dwelling and to take
a refuge in Germany. There they met
William -Powells, who immediately
aroused their sympathy by his wretched
polltude. His wife had left her home,
like the mother of Julia and Nora. The
two sisters resolved to unite their lives
with that of William and thus' to try
and atone as much as lay in their power
a little of their mother's fault. They
would brighten his loneliness with their
tenderness.
In their Idea â and also In William's â
this tenderness was to be a purely frater
nal affection, but it changed gradually
into a more overwhelming and less inno
cent sentiment. They both became at
tached to William, but William loved No
ra only. And one evening, after a walk
which made Lea's heart throb quickly â
for she recognized in it the Richmond in
cidentâWilliam and Nora's lips met in an
ardent kiss. The girl was immediately
filled with horror* of herself. It was In
vain that William showed her that a di
vorce was possible, that the courts would
certainly grant it in his favor. . Nora re
plied inflexibly:
"I did not come to profit by your wife's
sin. but to comfort you and cherish you
with a sister's love. That which human
law permits here and forbids elsewhere
does not concern me. You have a wife
still living."
Julia, jealous of William's love for Nora,
strengthened her In her determination to
sacrifice herself. She decided to leave

rials In order.
From the draw
ing class the
girls went to
the cloakroom with their blouses and then
to the playground to take tea. Lea did
not follow them, and was left alone,
standing before her table, face to face
with the little packet, which she regard
ed without touching.
When she had read the address she felt
a little relief. It was not entirely whfit
she had dreaded. That strange writing,
almost the writing of a child, full of Ir
regularities that formed a striking con
trast with the immense capital letters, re
vived in Lea's memories souvenirs of a
little mahogany desk, strewn with hun
dreds of sheets of paper, covered with the
same handwriting, and a sort of child
woman with a doll's face and short, curly
fair hair, sitting before the desk biting
a cork. penholder. Tinka Ortsen! The desk
upon which sho wrote in the drawing
room in Appletree Yard! And the novels
that she read oloud as fast as she imag
ined them, half turning toward her cus
tomary listeners, with an even, tranquil
voice! Lea could see again that little fig
ure, with the air of a fairy, princess, her
feet barely reaching to the carpet, and
rarely changing the outline of her short,
white starched skirt! â:*.
"Why has Tinka sent me-'a book?
Although less disquieting than a letter,
the packet signified an intention, a desire
to renew relations that had been broken
for a year and a half. Lea was terrified
to find that this return into tne past, far
from startling her as it would have done
formerly, now charmed her. Her heart
beat with an irresistible Joy. a joy so
overwhelming that It swept away all sad
ness and all anxiety.
She did not tear oft the wrapping of the
book. She felt incapable of taking any
resolution, 'ihe cries of the pupils play-

customary routine, put everything in or
der, then slipped the book into her leather
portfolio, left the classroom, taking the
key with her. attained the lavatory, where
she washed her hands and face. Then,
and then only, she hesitated.
Pirnltz and Madame Sanz were absent:
they had b*gun the furnishing of the lit
tle house they had rented In the Avenue
Henri Martin for the pupils of the Free
College. But Frederlque would certainly
be In the playground: The duty of gen
eral supervision fell to one of the foun
dresses in rotation, and it was Fred
erique's turn to-day. Lea felt that she
could not sustain her elder sister's gaze.
It was already so hard for her to with
stand, it seemed to scrutinize her very
Boul-on ordinary, occasions. How could
Bho hide from her such profound emo
tions? She felt she had not courage to
reveal its cause to her."
She thought of the library, and as noon
as the idea occurred to her she beheld
herself reading the mysterious book in
the corner by the window. She took up
her leather portfolio again, and with her
heart beating like that of one hurrying to
upon an idle, tyrannical society.
In the silence a little voice cried from
the neighboring room:
"Mamma Vecke!"
Duyvt-cke ran to the child's bed, Reml
neau and Germaine following her.
Gaston put his arms around Duyvecke's
neck as she bent over him and whispered
in her ear. They only heard the young
girl's reply.
"I will come again."
"No." said the child aloud: "you must
not go away. You must stop here. You
must stop here always."
Duyvecke kissed him again.
"All right." she said.
Gaston a head fell back on the pillow,
but his black, wide-open eyes never left
the pretty Fleming's face. He was still
anxious, and had made up his mind not to
bo cheated again.
They withdrew from the bed.
"What did he whisper in your ear?"
asked Romir.oau.
"He wants me to stay with him. Xatur

1 must go with Germaine. The doctor

CH AFTER VI
Tho vast rectangular room where Lea
p.ivp her lessons In water colors to a score
of puj.ils v.-as bright that afternoon In
Juno, with the warm rays of sunlight still
powerful, though it was after 4 o'clock.
On the other side of the Rue Delormel,
whore tliis wing of the building was sit
uated, the chestnut trees on tho vacant
plot of ground showed their motionless
verdure, dry and dust-laden, above the
boundary wall. Not a breath of fresh air
w.iF stirring outside. Tho twenty girls in
their glazed calico blouses, perched on
high stools or standing before their desks,
lr-anr-d over the drawing boards with
brows covered with beads of perspiration,
thoir eyes attentively watching the splash
of color made by tho brush, while they bit
their lips cr a little jtrimace contorted
their mouths in the effort to obey their in
structions. In spite of the big window
openings and the scrupulous cleanliness
of everything, the large room, with its
white walls, was lillt-d with the acrid odor
of thotr damp hair, of their youthful,
perspiring, imprisoned bodies.
Lea went along their ranks Inspecting
them one after the other. For a little
time she would stand without speaking,
following the work of the pupil, who
who sometimes stopped, upon which she
would say:
"Don't stop! Continue! Don't pay any
attention to mo."
When a wash of color had been laid
on she would make a few remarks.
Sometimes she would take the brush her-
Eelf and illustrate her observations with
a direct example, skillfully correcting a
mistake, and then go to the next pupil.
During the two long hours that this daily
water color class iasted she did l.ot In
terrupt her lesson for a single moment
The pupils even -noticed that she took
less and less leisure every day. She no
longer, as formerly, returned for a mo
ment to the little platform reserved for
the mistrefs to write a letter, to glance
over a ir..ipazinc or to rest. Only a few
minutes he-fore the young artists, grave
and orderiy, though they retained all the
curiosity and mischievous spirit natural
to their age. had witnessed an instance
of this professional, devotion. The girl
who wns the monitress for the week had
oome In with a little packet, apparently
a book, delivered by the postman, and
walked toward Lea. holding it out to her.
]>a was rectifying a tint in the little
color tablet cf a pupil, and she said, with
out taking the book:
"T.hanks. Alexandrine. Put It on my
table."
And while twenty pairs of eyes follow
ed the course of the book in Alexandrine's
hand, its ascension on the platform, and,
finally, its installation on the mistress' ta
ble. Lea calmly added -drops of -water to
the yellow ochre in the tablet.
"You see. Alice," she said to the little
brunette with Chinese eyes, whose stool
she hnd taken for the moment, "if you
do not prepare the tint very carefully b>
mixing it thoroughly and by seeing that
everything is perfect before you begin,
you may be as careful as you like in put
ting on the wash. It will always be spotty.
There, the color Is ready! Now lay it on
quickly with an even brush."
She gave up her place quickly to Alice
Aubry. who. climbing on to the stool, set
to work again, quite proud of having at
tracted the attention of the mistress, and
began to paint with her short-sighted, al
mond-shaped eyes almost on the board.
"Adele, you did not wash your brush
properly. s=o the color lias altered while
you were painting. The red has become
brown. My dear Claire, you have forgot-
portrait of herself in the book! She had
been convinced, absolutely certain, that it
would relate her story and that of Georg.
She resumed her reading. The story con
tinued with an Interminably minute de
scription of the little city of bath 3 built
at the bottom of a sort of funnel formed
by the high hills, a spur from neighbor
ing mountains. All Tinka's novels began
in this way. The opening was always
wearisome, long and cloudy, as though
the author's ideas awoke with an
effort. Little by little, like tho
breaking of day, life and warmth
began to vivify the pages until
the reader was surrounded by a flame so
bright, so ardent and so pure thai the
very obscurity of the beginning was illum
inated by contrast with it. Lea, after hav
ing glanced through a quarter of the vol
ume with an irritated impatience, felt the
influence of this mysterious flame, one
capable of illuminating the most abstruse
theories, of animating beings that cold
reason would regard as impossible.
The two characters of the book were
face to face. They were drawn vividly,
at once simply and surely, without any
attempt after effect; seen, as it were, from
within, with a marvelous sense of what
might be called the realization of the pic
turesque side of their souls. And In those
two souls Lea found her own and that of
Georg. Only, by an unexpected artifice,
the author had changed their sex; Wil
liam represented Lea and Nora represent
ed Georg. How could Lea fall to recog
nize in the following lines the modltled
delineation of her own nature?
"William made one think of a red rose
bush cultivated in a Northern hothouse, a
plant upon which had been grafted one
of those simple pale roses of Scandinavia
which resemble a lily. Only regular prun
ing prevented nature- from liberating the
original sap that struggled and rebelled
against the constraint of the thorny
branches. And if for two successive sea
sons the gardener should neglect to trim
the plant the sap would conquer and red
roses bloom instead of the pale, abortive
lilies."
THE SUNDAY CALIi.
ness and death, was It not becauaÂ© aha
saw Georg dying before her eyes?
"I have killed you! cried Nora at tha
end of the book.
And that despairing cry haunted Lea.
She could only think of Georg now. with
"William's features. Feeble and ill. he re
covered toe influence over- his betrothed
that he had exercised in London hefora
her modesty had taken alarm. She had
been strong to oppose him when she saw
him twice afterward in Paris, robust and
insisting upon his rights, almost imperl
ous and more like ordinary men. But
now she was anxious, softened, ready to
yield when she again thought of him.
weak, solitary and dying through h*r
absence.
"Are you ready, dearest?'
Lea was so profoundly lost In reflection
that she had not even- thought of dissimu
lating or of breaking the silence with a
few words. Her sister's voice aroused
her. She was standing before the mir
ror, her toilet finished, her eyes gaziag
into vacancy.
"Yes. I am ready."
"Let us go down." said Frederlqua.
"The second bell has rung."
They were the last to arrive in the din
lng-room. Each went to her place. Lea
surrounded by her favorites, Alice Aubry,
Lydia Ronacker, Georgette Vincent and
little Alexandrine, woo had brought
Tinka's book to her in the afternoon. Tha
youthful chatter and conversation con
tinued as usual. They talked about
drawing, about wacer-color painting,
about experiments in chemistry, about
their games of prisoners' base, about gar
dening and also about Komaine's lectures.
Lea usually took part in their conversa
tion. Something in her was really Inter
ested In them in spite of her melancholy.
JBut that evening their talk seemed to
her like a distant, indifferent echo. She
did not even try to raakf a pretense of
Joining in their talk. She replied to
Alexandrine, who remarked her abstrac
tion:
"Yes, dearest, I am rather anxious."
The end of the meal set her at liberty.
Pupils and mistresses dispersed and went
into the courtyard. Lea joined a group
which included lime. Sanz. Pirnitz. Fred
erique. Germaine and Daisy, gathered
around a bench under the acacias. The
evening was very sultry. The tall sur
rounding buildings, the school as well aa
the workshops, scorched all day long by
the blazing sun. seemed to radiate a sort
of ardent reverberation in the evening.
Even the children's habitual inclination
for movement seemed to be a little sub
dued by the heavy atmosphere. They
walked about in parties, or, sitting ia cir
cles, talked in semi-whispers.
As Lea took a place r.tar Pirr.itz, Mile.
Heurteau was saying:
"According to the information T hays
been able to gather, an organized cam
paign against us is beginning. The So
maine de tit. Charles ia on too good terms
with the municipality to have declared
war without a. previous understanding."
"But we have, no quarrel with the mu
nicipality," objected Frederique.
"No, out we refui;e to be dependent
upon it, and that is what irritates tho
authorities. We have refused the subven
tion they offered us for prizes. You re
member we refused It somewhat against
my advice."
"We could not accept it." saM Plrnltz,
"as we do not give any prizes."
"We ought to have accepted It all thÂ«
same. Conditions are different in Paris
from what they are in London. We c:m
only exist by the tolerance of the admin
istiative authorities, and they will not
tolerate us unless we at least pretend to
take them seriously ami to have need of
them."
As she uttered the word?, a fleeting,
tawny Hash gleamed in the warm haze.
"Lightning:" said Germaine Soubize. in
a startled voice.
"Yes." said Mme. Sanz, "a storm IÂ»
threatening. The day has been so sultry.
It has been difficult to breathe."
The air became charged with electric
ity. There were no clouds in the sky, and
yet it was now difficult to discern tho
stars.
The flash of lightning had agitated the
pupils. They all ro?e, then came together
again, forming bigger and more silent
groups. Germaine took Lea's hand, and
Lea felt the girl's nervous lingers griu
inic into her flesh.
"I do not like storms," whispered Ger
maine.
"Oh! It Is far from here." snld Lea-
It will probably not break over us."
"Do you think so?" asked Germaine,
anxiously.
Mile. Ileurteau continued to expose her
Ideas regarding the events of the day.
"Our neighbor, the most influential man
In the Council, is against us." she said.
"What! lmramberty?" cried t>aiay.
"Why, he founded a. scnolarship here! llÂ»
has never shown ua any hostility.'"
"Duramberty is our enemy; KrederlquÂ©
knows it well. Everybody knows it."
Frederique did not reply and fi_>lt happy
that the dusk hid her sudden blush. \V aj
it possible every one kntw the painful se
cret of the past, the infamous proposition
made to her by the manufacturer, the re
fusal she had given him? Had they di
vined it. or had the manufacturer carried
his Impertinence so far as to relate tho
incident himself?
"They are a lot of wretches:" cried
Germame Soublze. "And to think that
such a council pretends to be socialistic.
that not one of the members will take our
part' If we were not poor, feeble worm-n
they would not dare attack us: But we
wilt defend ourselves, even if we ara
women! The inspector was wise not to
conn- into my Class! With the help of
two or three of my big pupils I would
have thrown him through the window."'
They all laughed, and Daisy Craggs
cried: "Come, cyme, Germaint. Don't ba
angry!"
"Angry!" replied Oermaine. "Were you
angry at my aÂ«e when you were on puard
with a ritle in '-our h.nrd at tho window
of your father's 'arm in Galway, where
Fenians were hidden?"
"All that is so long ago." said Daisy,
with a sigh. "Besides, we are not In Ire
land."
"I think the situation i 3 exactly the
same!" said Germaine, more excitedly.
"Our enemies want to drive us out of our
house, exactly as the English landlords
evict their Irish tenants. 1 don't know
what you're going to do, but no one shall
lay a finger on me with impunity!"
In the silence that followed her last
words the sky quivered Â¦with a fresli flash
of lightning. All conversation ceaÂ»e<l.
Every one listened. A slight rumbling like
the funereal beat of a muffled (irum was
heard dying away in the west. Then sud
denly a gust of wind from some unknown
point swayed tho slender acacias and
swent a cloud of dust across the court
yard.
"Oh! let us go in," said Germaine, in a
charged TOlCe.
The bell rang the end of evening recrea
tion and the hour for retiring, fastinct
ively silent at the approach of the sfTm.
the pupils hurried toward the school
buildings. The mistresses. Krouped before
the door, waited until they had passed.
Oermaine pressed close to Lea and laid
her forehead upon her companion's shoul
der to avoid pef lng the lightning. Lea
looked up at the sky. whore now could h*
seen but a single star. The approaching
storm bad tensed her nerve* also. riut
this strife of atmospheric forces agitated
her without alarming her. She was living
In that state of Intimate distress in which
the conflict of the elements teems a har
monious benefit. Like the dethroned, de
spairing King Lear, she could have cried
to the tempest: '"Blow, winds, and crÂ«ic!c
your cheeks!" â¢
The pupils were all Indoors. A confused
trampling like that of a little flock of
sheep died away in the spiral of thÂ» stair
case. A few big drops of rain fell on tho
mistresses as they were entering in turn.
Alexandrine, the little minitress. was giv
ing out the evening mail in the vestibule.
Lea recosnlzed t-dith Crates' writing
upon a letter she handed to Daisy. Pir
nitz, taking an envelone from Alexan
drine's hand, murmured In a whisper to
Frederique: "It's from Duyvecke!"
She slipped the letter In her pocket.
Daisy, on the contrary, went upstairs
reading hers. On the first floor they all
separated.
"Edith sends you her best wtsftes." raid
Daisy to Frederlque and Lea, r.ho wero
going to their room together, "dhe ha*
decided to leave Clarisa & Sor.3 and to
become a nurse."
Her sentence was lnterrur>*eil by the
sound of doora slamrr.lnjr. nil the doors
that had been opened and thru the wind
shut furiously. The smell of warm rain
filled the corritlcr.
"Oh, come with mo. Daisy." muttered
Germalr.e, "I dare not leave you."
"Good night!" cried Daisy to the two
sisters, walking away with Gerrruiine.
The rain beat upon the windows while
I^en and Frederique were undressing and
making their evening toilet. The storm
appeared to have resolved Itself into this
tropical deluge The rumbling was less
frequent and faint. The rumbMn? thun
der that followed the flasi.o-i at lornr inter
val* was hardy audible. The two sisters
exchanged but a few words, then were
Filer.!, and finally lay down without any
further conversation. When the light

before falling into their first sleep on
forelen soil, they had embraced in loving

of the prisoners, and withdrawing it gent
ly pull out the filaments and carry the

where they are united and through which
they are drawn and at the same time
twisted into one and . wound on a spool.
The apparatus, which at once makes the
drawing, twisting and winding of the
thrf ad, is of very ingenious devising and
gives excellent results.
The spiders submit to tho winding-out
process without resistance, in fact seem
rather to enjoy it. As they are emptied
they are replaced by others. After thi?
operation the "convalescents" are placed
in a "park" constructed for thitf purpose
with bamboo poles planted in the ground
and joined by a kind of trellis-work,
where after some days of reposo, those
who do not fall prey to their stronger
neighbors are ready to undergo another
operation. Tho. thread thus obtained is
very clean and pure and can be woven

Tn the first place the spielers are brought

just when they are ripe for the winding
process, which should be at once proceed

and shut up as short a time as possible
on account of thpir bad habit of devour
ing each other. By delay there is risk of
finding only a. last survivor of a promis
ing lot of full and ripe female Halabes.
As it is desirable to unite several fila
ments and twist them on themselves into
a.single thread of a given size the spiders
are arranged for the winding out in
groups, generally twelve or twenty-four.
It is very important not to wound or mu-
tilate them during the operation, as when
carefully handled each one can support In
the course of a single month four or live
winding out operations. representing

California. As the Per?'.3:i monks, return-

The Halabe silk may mean much to Cal

tive clime by that name may in the
course of j:o great number of years make
California the mistress of one of the great
nnd most, remunerative Industries of tho

that Tananarivo threatens to dethrone

Bl'.k Industry has fiouriFhed.
The Halabe, as it Is called by the Mala
pachs. Is but little known outside of
Madagascar, except to those naturalists
â¢who have made a special study of the
FPrtcigcni (silk-producing) arachT.ids. To
them It is known as thee Nephila Slada
frascarensis. They flourish by th*> millions
In the Imerina. district of Madagascar.
In which tho capital, Tananarivo, Is sit
uated. But reproduction In captivity.
however. Is very difficult, because the fe-
Tnale, who produces the thread. Is of
Fuch f.ercÂ« and cannibalistic disposition
that the mala can only approach her with
the greatest precautions, and after being
assured of her willingness and docility,
*vcn then half the time she kills and eats
him before the Interview Is ended. The
â¢weaker members of her own sex are also
her frequent prey.
Therefore the Halabcs are found In
frreat. numbers or.ly In those places where
they are assured of abundant nourifh
snent, without the necessity of devouring
each other. Euch as tho great groves of
mango trees Rnd the royal gardens In the
Environs of Tananarivo. Under these un
favorable conditions it is almost impossible
to hope for an unlimited artificial produc
tion, as In the case of the silk moth, and
it is necessary to confine the operations
to collecting the living spiders in those
favored localities where they swarm in
myriads In their natural and wild state,
and rmpty them of their much desired
product as near their habitat as possible,
so rs to make the most of what they can
give.
The si:k cf the Halabes Is of a marvelous
color. A thread of "gold could not be more
brilliant, nor of a purer yellow. It has a
tenuity, an elasticity and a tenacity much
superior to* the silk from the cocoon,
which permits its being worked into stuff
Â«'f wonderful firmness and exquisite plia
bility, st the same time of a solidity un-.
rivaled. The merit cf the discovery of
taking tho silk from the living spider be
longs to a French Catholic missionary in
Madagascar, Father Cambone. Following
the example of tho Malagachs, he at first
collected a large number of the webs that
covered the gardens of the mission where
he was stationed and carded and spun
them. The thread produced, however, was
by necessity of the case of mich irregu
larity that he determined to find some
other method of utilizing the immense
quantity of splendid material that was
everywhere going to waste as far as hu
man purposes were concerned. â¢Â»
He finally hit upon the idea of drawing
the thread directly from the spider, whom
he shut up and held securely in a small
match box provided with an aperture
through which the point of the abdomen
projected and from which he wound out
the thread. The method he employed is
the one used to-day, but the mechanical
arrangements for holding the insect and
ruling in and twisting the thread have
been much improved upon by M. Nogue,
the director of the technical school at
Tananarive In this institution establish
ed by General Galliani, In the palace of
the former Queen, there has been for
pome time In operation a model school
for teaching the young Malagach women
the process of taking the thread without
injury to the Bp'.f'-r and weaving it into
cloth.
A correspondent' of *Lo~ Monde Illustre
visited the school some time since, and
sent the following description, Illustrated
by photographs (which are here repro
duced) of the different phases of the cu
rious operation:
more than one-half la obtainable as reeled
â¢Ilk, the remainder, consisting of surface
floss or hard gummy husk or "knub."
The net reelable material from one co
coon runs from SCO to CO yards, and even
this Is of very variable thickness. whilÂ»
en the other hand the Halabe silk is
drawn out into one long continuous fila
ment, as uniform in size and strength as
a drawing of steel wire. Tho material
being uniform and the operation of draw
ing it out beir-p: continuous tho filament
Is homogeneous throughout its length.
Hence the greatly superior appearance of
the material woven from the Halabo silk
over that woven from the eoroon product.
The tenacity and increasing strength of
the Halabe thread is likewise far superior
to that of the cocoon, so tho cloth woven
from the former not only presents a much
more uniform surface appearance, but
possesses far greater lasting powers than
the latter. The cost up to the point of
winding en the spool, where there Is a
supply of spiders at hand. Is much less
than that of the cocoon silk.
It would perhaps be as difficult to Ray
when spider thread cloth was first made
as to say when paper was first made.
The beginning of the use of papyrus, from
which the latter material takes its name,
can be well fixed in the chronology ot
Egypt, whence it was Introduced Into
Europe, but the Chinese como forward
with well substantiated claims of discov
ery antedating the other by centuries. So
too In the cas^ of spider-thread cloth. In
Europe Reaumur in 1710 first tried the ex
periment of drawing the thread from tho
living spider and weaving it into cloth. Ha
had. however, only the small and rather
unfruitful silk-producing spiders of South
ern Europe to experiment with, and when
he found from what he had obt lined that
!t would require some 700.000 of the llttla
animals to produce one pound of silk hÂ»
dropped the economic side of his Investi
gations altogether and only finished his
work for the sake of the curiosity. HÂ»
succeeded in getting thread enough, to
weave a piece of wonderful cloth, not
larger than a gentleman's handkerchief.
Other experiments with spider web cloth.
in Europe and elsewhere, have been suc
cessful In no greater measure. Not so la
Madagascar, howevejr.
Though until Father Cambone took th*
matter in hand only the already woven
webs were used, spider web cloth had
been produced by the natives sinceâ how
long no one can say. Now, though but in
Its first birth, as it were, the industry

proportions that will make the valleys of
Imerlna rival those of the Rhone for
wealth of product. The French colonial

captain. He and I were "both Americans,
and there was only one Irishman in the
crowd. He was a common sailor; the rest
of the crew were mostly negroes and Ma
lays.
"We cruised about, going to Fayal and
on to Australia frora there. We had
aboard 200 barrels of sperm oil when we
finally reached Bunbury, which is about
ninety miles from Fremantle, the prison
town. It is fair enough to call it that,
for the town Is nothing more than an
environment for the prison.

It helped brace up our courage, and we
knew that without all the courage in the

undertaking. They had a dreary time of
It. I puess. They were allowed a good
deal of freedom within the town, as we
found out afterward; they were put to
work at different jobs in the town out
side the prison, but they felt pretty, sure
there was no way to escape."
In the life of John Boyle O'Reilly an
account of his punishment in Australia is
described. Here is a paragraph from the
book :
"The first official function was the read
ing of the rules (of Fremantle prison).
What struck O'Reilly most in that long
code was the startling peroration to the
enumeration of so many offensesâ 'the
penalty of which is death!'" r ."
They must have been a glad group of
men who heard the whispered news that
a party of daring seamen had left home
and were risking the dangers not only
of sea but. far more, of British displeas
ure, to take them away from a place
where the death penalty threatened from
a stern wall.
Captain Smithâ captain now, mate then
âdoes not dwell upon the dangers of the
action together. Breslin was to return to
the prisoners and make them ready. Cap
tain Anthony would go to Kockingham.
about twenty-two miles from the prison
town, and there wait to receive them and.
bring them out in the lfttle boat to me.
I was to have command of the Catalpa
for the time and hold her out a little -way
from shore, ready to'reteive the escaping
men.
"The preparations were careful and
complete even to the arranging of a cipher
cede for use in telegraphing. On Satur
day afternoon, the day before Easter of
-1576, we sailed beyond' Rottennost Light
house, and on Sunday morning, when we
were about thirty miles southwest of the
lighthouse, our captain left in his small
boat. He took a few- picket! men along
with him and left the bulk of the crew
behind under me.
"Then some very important things hap
pened on shoreâ as quietly, too, as though
they were every-day occurrences. In the
broad daylight of Easter Monday sorre
carriages drove the twenty-two miles
from Fremantle to Rockingham. They
contained the six prisoners and Breslin.
their rescuer.
"It is a wonder to me that they ever
succeeded in getting so far without being
overtaken. There was no attempt at con
cealment â the men simply entered the car
riages and drove away. Perhaps they
were at their various working places. One
was the parson's gardener and another
T^Vunployed breaking stone, if I' retnem-
Then they sighted the boat on the Geor
gette. It didn't take them long to decide
on action. It was a race between tha
Catalpa and the police boat to see which,
would get to the runaways tlrst.
"Close along to our lee quarter ths
Georgette kept. Again and again we
headed her off. At last we were close to
Captain Anthony' 3 party.
"I swung around so that the Catalp*
was between the two small boats. I
kept in that position so steadily that ths
police boat could not see the other. Then
all of a sudden I lowered the falls,
grapplrd the little boat fore and aft and
hoisted the whole thing on board. It was
not until I had got the men safely up that
the captain of the police ho, at knew wh.it
I was doing. Then he shouted. 'Well donÂ«Â»
and a good Voyage to you.' I don't know
who he was. but I'll never forget thd
generosity of that.
"We thought then that all th* trouble
was over. But not quite. Next day
the lookout on the bow reported a sail
about three points on the weather bow.
Breslin thought it was a coaster, but
when I looked I was sure it was the
Georgette.
"I was right, mores the pity. She came
after us and at last fired a ball across th*
Catalpa's bow. She demanded that we
heave to. When Captain Anthony refused
the gunboat's captain said: 'I'll give you
ten mlnutei to surrender, or I'll sink you.*
"This was serious. They knew we had
prisoners aboard. I went below and talked
to the six prisoners and askrcl what they
wanted to do. 'If you who have saved us
choose to surrender we are willing." they
said, 'for we don't want to cost you your
lives; but if you choose to keep on we say
die rather than surrender.'
"'We above board said the same. The
crew was asked thrir wish. 'Sink or swim,
no surrender." they replied. I added: 'Let
him fire and we'll ell sink here together
before he'll got a man off this ship. We're
into this and we'll carry it through.'
"And r.-e did. We made our escape,
though the gunboat pursued for a little
way. In August. lS7t>. we landed in New
York with the rescued prisoners, and
there the little party broke up.
"Where are they all now? I don't know.
Scattered on the four winds, I suppose.
But this much I do knowâ they are all
what we k-ft them, free men In a frea

CLAIMS TOWNSITE
AS MINING LAND
Utica Company Asserts Title to
Property in the Heart of
Angels Camp.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS CAMP, April 28.â Owners of
the Utica mine of this place have created
much excitement among property owners
by asserting title to land that reaches
the heart of Angels and has many busi
ness houses and residences on it. The
Utica Company bases Its title on a deed
obtained from Otto F'etcher, a resident of
this place, who sold his claim for $15,000.
The property in dispute was in pioneer
days the Confidence mining claim, which
was staked off by Fletcher's ancestors.
Twenty years afterward. Justice Cooley
says, Judge Norman, then occupying the
Superior bench of the county, was asked
by residents to procure a Government title
to the town site. He received from the
Government, in trust for the locators, a
patent to the site as agricultural land, antt
subsequently deeded It to them. The locat
ors of the Confidence, making no protest,
were presumed to have lost all title.
The Utica people claim that the mineral
location is a preferred title and still hold?
good. A meeting of those owning lota In
the disputed parcel of land will be held
soon to prepare for making a legal battle.
Some fine points of law regarding the lo
cation of agricultural and mineral lands
will probably be decided through this coa

OMAHA. Nebr.. April 28.â 1n the report
and opinion of the Interstate Commerce
Commission filed in the case of A. J. Guj>
tin against the Burlington, the Union Pa
cific, the Rio Grande and the Southern
Pacific railroads, the city of Kearney se
cures a reduction in the rate of shipping
sugar from California common points to
that station.
The report of the commission Is volum
inous, covering twenty-two quarto pages.
Briefly, it decides that as regards the
Burlington road Kearney is not an inter
mediate point between the coast an<l
Omaha and therefore the bill of the com
plainant, as it affects that road. Is dis
missed. It decides that in the case of the
T'nion Pacific Kearney la an Intermediate
point between the coast and Omaha. ThÂ«
commission then considers the rate of 50
cents per ton on supar from the coast to
Omaha and goes into the matter of com
petition for business between those
points, showing that the rate is affected
by the rate between San Francisco and
New York by vessels around Cape Horn
and by the rate from New York and Mis
souri River points over the competing
line, all rail, rail and canal, rail and
water.' The conclusion ia that by reason
of this competition the Union Pacific is
entitled to haul sugar to Omaha and tr>
Kearney, where no such competition ex
ists, but that it is not entitled to chargo
4f> cents in addition. Therefore the rate la
reduced to a more reasonable figure,
which the commission fixes at not to ex
ceei\l3 cents, makinsr the maximum rate
charged to Kearney 65 cents against 50
cents to Omaha.

FLEEING TO ESCAPE
THE RISING WATERS
Every Vehicle in Waco Utilized
to Carry Residents to Places
of Safety.
WACO, Texas/ April, 23.â The flood
situation remains* practically
unchanged from last nigttt.. Con
ditions could hardly be worse.
Every available wagon, dray
and float was brought into. use,
and the entire night was spent in moving
hundreds of families out of the submerged
district. There are no new names added
to the list of fatalities to-day, but reports
of persons missing and who were last seen
in the overflowed section are numerous.
A call for aid, signed by the Mayor and
many prominent citizens, has been sent
out, and a mass-meeting of citizens of
Waco will be held Monday night to devise
means to aid tho suffering and those In
need. The local weather bureau gives
the rainfall for the past twenty-four hours
as 4.05 inches, the heaviest on record. It
was believed that the worst of the over
flow was at an end until the Government
bureau posted the following bulletin to
day:
"Excessive rains throughout the Brazos
drainage basin will probably cause a de
cided rise in the Brazos River, overflowing
much low land from McLennan County
to the gulf during ; the next ten days.
Please warn residents along the river."''
Much anxiety is felt now over the
Brazos overflow, and runners have been
sent to notify the farmers in the low
lands. The flood yesterday was not alone
confined to this county. Temple and Bel
ton, thirty miles south, reported vast dam
age by overflows, the rainfal at Temple
being 5.94 inches, by far the heaviest ever
known. ,
A special from Belton says: "Not since
1852 has this city and vicinity been visited
by such a. downpour of rain as fell here
during the past two days. The Salido
River broke all previous high water marks
and destroyed the fine iron wagon bridge
at this place. At Summersville the school
house was carried away and the dam
washed out. The large steel bridge at Lit
tle River, on the main line of the Mis
souri, Kansas and Texas, is wrecked. The
Leon River is out of its banks and the
electric plant is flooded," the city being 1 in
total darkness."
Calverts reports a; fifteen-foot rise In
the river there. . The Navasota at Court

Hempstead. At that point the river is
out of its banks and rising fast. The bot
toms will be full of water before morn
ing.
At Chapel Hill the river is booming and
backwater covers a large section of flat
lands. The same conditions prevail at
Saley. At Richmond the river is ten feet
higher than yesterday from local rains
and the waters are still to come.
Columbia reports the river near the
tops of tho banks .and rising fast. The
country Is already flooded and the river
is expected to repeat its performances of
last July and spread half across Brazoria

100 feet of track washed out at one place
on the Montgomery branch and 500. feet in

two bridges have been swept away and
200 feet of track unplaced.
The Southern Pacific is operating its
westbound trains for California around
tho wrecked bridge at Columbus by the
same route as before. .A day train goes
only, as far west as Alley ton. It is re
ported here that all trains on the San Aji

no trains were run to-day. The telegraph
wires are also down.
IMMENSE DAMAGE BY

trary, most of the Texas rivers are ris

Ashbourae, Lord Chancellor of Ireland,
has been lecturing to large audiences in
London, dressed in the picturesque abbre
viated s^nerally associated with
Pitchmen. He makes an impassioned
pica fr>r the divine right of Hibernians to
wear kilts. Mr. Gibson is a learned young
man who married a Frenchwoman and
consistently resides in England.
Now there is talk of making the new
Jr!=h Guards Brigade masquerade in kilts,
though the reports which have come from
South Africa telling of the suffering of
the barr-l^gped Highlanders and the sor
rows v.-hkh are attached to this out-of
date uniform are recent enough to banish
the suggestion into the long list of foolish
absurdities. It is probable that the War
Office will take that view.
In consonance with the Queen's present
vl?hes, as many as possible of the new
Guards Regiment will be mustered for the
Usual birthday trooping of colors and re
view ceremonies in London on May 23.
This canoslxins and kilting would .be
merely humorous could the impartial on
looker forget the misery, poverty and
stagnation of industries that prevail
throughout southr-rn and western Ireland.
But in rlew of the conditions that exist In
that portion of the British isles the so
called Shamrock craze in England can
scarcely be considered anything but an
other instance on the part of the majority
<.t England's people of their complete fail
ure to grasp the nature of Ireland's needs,
however well meant and generous may be
the?e outward skin-deep signs of friend

pl?tol m hand ordered the women to
throw up their hands.
Instead of obeyinjr. the trio began
screaming and started to run. The foot
pad pursued them for a short distance
and then disappeared. As soon as this
was reported Police Captain Peterson or
dered a squad of patrolmen Into the Lake
side district. As fast as detectives and of
ficers could be mustered they were scat
tered over this fashionable quarter of
Oakland.
At H) o'clock the second hold-up occur
red. Charles S. Greene, librarian of the
tree Public Library, was stopped at
i ourtoenth and Alice streets by Vetsera.
Greene thought he was the victim of a
joker when he heard the order to throw
i:p his hands and obeying started on a
brisk walk. Vetsera followed him. but
save up the chase. He then ran upon his
last victim. Harris Allen, who resides
with Greene at 1257 Jackson street. Allen
was only a block away from the house
when Vttsera thrust a pistol at his head
and commanded "Hands up." Allen had
a good view of the weapon and the holder
of it, but started to grapple with the rob
ber.
\etsera grabbed Allen by the coal, tear
ing it open, wnd with one hand tried to
drag Allen's watch out of his pocket. In
the tussling the robber snapped his pistol
tnree times in Allen's face, but the'cart
ridge." luckily failed to explode and a
murder was thus prevented. Vetsera was
caught two blocks from where he stood
up Allen. He said he was going to East
Oakland to complete his night's work.
He secured nothing in Oakland. Ho
said 15 was all the money he got from
his San Francisco hold-ups.
Before he was locked in his cell Vetsera
said: "The next day after I held up tho
man I shot I went down to the City Hall
to see what the police were doing. I
talked with several of them there. They
seemed afraid I might come around and
steal their salary warrants."
Vetsera ?ald he had lived for a short
time in Oakland, but he refused to say
where his lodgings had been.
But There Are Others.
At a late hour last night a younsr colored
man named Brown reported to the police
that he had been held up about 8 o'clock
by a footpad at the corner of Jackson and
Steiner streets. Brown said the robber
secured $5 from him. The footpad wors
a white handkerchief for a miak.
WjJ^AKLAXD. April 28.â The masked
M V liighwayman who has been terror
1&l3 izing the Western Addition In San
Francisco and baffling the Police
Department of the city was cap
tured In the fashionable lakeside district
of Oakland to-night at 11 o'clock, after
having held up five persons within two
hours. The murderous footpad in Simon
L. Munckorosvon Vetsera, a fair-haired,
youthful native of Poland. ID years old, a
cook, driven to robbery because he was
out of employment.
With freedom he confessed to the four
hold-ups committed across the bay and
to the five>in this city which to-night
brought him to the end of his rope. The
pistol and a black , knotted silk handker
chief which were his implements of trade
were found in his pockets. The arrest
was the result of quick and clever work
on the part of Detective George Kyte and
Charles Hamerton. who ran the footpad
down on bicycles, capturing him near
the corner of Thirteenth and Harrison
streets, within three blocks of the heart
of the city. Vetsera unhesitatingly ad
mitted that he was guilty, declaring that
he might as well be hanged for a sheep as
a lamb.
His operations early this evening in
Oakland were identical with his method*
in San Francisco and the police were
positive that he was the name robber who
was striking terror in the residence sec
tion of the Western Addition.
His capture was largely due to the
prompt action of Night Police Captain
Peterson, who sent a score of detectives
and policemen into the Lakeside district
as soon a3 the first attempted robbery
of the night was reported shortly after 8
o'clock. Kyte and Hamerton. on their
wheels, were zigzagging through the dis
trict east of Harrison street to Lake Mer
ritt. stopping every person they met.
Shortly before 11 o'clock they were riding
along Thirteenth street and saw a man
walking ahead of them on the north side
of the street, just east of Harrison.
Jumping from their wheels they drew
their pistols, and in a second both detec
tives were at the suspicious pedestrian.
He fitted in a general way the vague de
scription they had of the robber.
Before he had time to make a move the
detectives seized his arms. Kyte searched
him hurriedly and found the silk hand
kerchief mask in a coat pocket. The pis
tol was dug out of another pocket by
Hamerton. Nothing else Â»^ut some odds
and ends were brought to light. The rob
ber had not a cent. The pistol was an
old-fashioned, rusted weapon of foreign
make, carrying a 3S-caliber cartridge.
"What's this for?" was the surprised
robber's exclamation, as he -was r.eiÂ«s.
He said little more until the detectives
got him to the police station, and there
he lost no time in telling his story.
"I might as well admit everything. You
have got me," said Vetsera. "I gave
those San Francisco police all the trouble
they wanted. Yes. I am the robber. My
first hold-up was in San Francisco last
Sunday night. Then there was another on
Monday evening and two on Tuesday
night I shot at a man that night, but I
didn't 'know until the next day, when I
saw the papers, that I hit him."
The hold-ups were: Edward Xorthrup,
Sunday night; J. J. Deane. Monday: Mor
ris Sideman and Alexander Rogers. Tues
day, the latter having been wounded by
Vetsera. Continuing his story, the slender,
smooth-faced young robber said:
"It was laughable the way I fooled the
police. When they sent out the men dis
guised as women I used to walk along
the streets at night and bow to them. One
night I saw a couple standing under a
gaslight. The disguised policeman lifted
up his skirts to scratch a match and I
saw he had on trousers. With another
couple the 'woman' was a foot taller than
the man.
"I got tired of. trying In San Francisco,
so I came over here this morning to look
around and decide where to begin opera
tions to-night. The Oakland detectives
were too smart for me and I am caught.
Well, it can't be helped. I suppose.
"I came here from New York about six
months ago. My native place is Poland.
I had a girl In San Francisco, but she
left me a few days ago and went to Port
land. No. I will not tell you where I
lived. I am a cook, but I have not been
working for some time, and so, being
broke, I thought I would try to raise some
money by standing up people. I tried to
hold up folks that looked as If they had
money. 1 followed the man I shot for
blocks, thinking he was a rich man. But
none of them panned out very well."
Vetsera was charged with robbery. He
will not be turned over to the San Fran
cisco police, as he has confessed sufficient
of robberies in Oakland to insure his im
prisonment for many years. The police
believe Vetsera is insane.
The crimes which led to the robber's
capture to-night were of the same daring
nature that characterized his work in
San Francisco. The first holdup was re
ported to the police shortly after 8
o'clock. Mrs. Steddon. Miss Beeman and
Miss Bennett, residing at 317 Boulevard
Terrace, were walking along that "street,
one hundred yards from their house,
when a masked man jumped upon them
from the shadow of some trees and with

Workmen Already Provid

Total Value of Froperty Destroyed

Placed at Fifteen Mil

OTTAWA, April 28.â The estimates on
the damage wrought by Thursday's fire
proved to be rather over than under the
mark. The survey of the field gives the
following results:
Dead, seven; homeless, 15,000; buildings
burned, 3000: persons out of work, 5000;
value of property destroyed, 115,000,000,
Lumbermen have been having a talk
over their losses, and while none of them
will speak for publication, the loss of
lumber alone is put at 125,000,000 feet. This
makes a total loss for lumber of about
$3.5^,000.
The great need for ready relief for the
sufferers from the disaster haa made all
strain their best efforts in that direction.
Quick response has been made from many
cities of the Dominion and goods and
money are coming in by every train.
Workmen have already started in Hull to
build shelter for the people. Everything
has to be conveyed over the river in boats.
At a mass-meeting of citizens it was
decided to instruct the City Council to ask
the Ontario Legislature for permission to
borrow $100,000 by issuing debentures to
aid the sufferers from the fire. General
sub-committees were appointed for the
purpose of affording relief. It was de
cided to build two shelter buildings in

PORTE LIKELY
TO REPLY IN
THE NEGATIVE
Answer to American Note
May Be a Virtual
Defiance.
It Is Believed That Without a Dis-
play of Force Turkey Will Not
Fay the Missionary
Claims.
CONSTANTINOPLE, April 28.â The
United States legation haa not yet re
ceived the Porte's answer to the note
handed to Tweflk Pasha, thÂ© Turkish For
eign Minister, by the American Charge
d'Affaires, regarding the Indemnity claims,
and the impression is gaining ground that
the reply will be in the negative, or even
that no reply will be made. The latter
alternative, however, seems to be unlikely.
The general opinion is that without a dis
play of force the Porte certainly will not
pay the claims, because it wishes to show
the Moslem world that It only yielded to
force.
It is not considered here that a simple
rupture of diplomatic relations will render
the Porte easier to deal with; but a rup
ture of formal relations is not necessary,
while the sending of a warship to a Medi
terranean port would suffice to obtain a
settlement In less than twenty-four hours.
The same proposition for the settlement
of the Indemnity question by an order of
a warship, in the price of which the In
demnity should be Included, was formerly
made to France and Italy, but M. Con
stans and Senor Pansa rejected the pro
posal.
The newspaper critclsms and comments
upon the attitude of Turkey in this affair
are causing great irritation at the Yildiz
Kiosk. â¢ . â¢ . â¢Â¦ . i
WASHINGTON, April' 28.â The United
States Government has not received the
slightest Intimation from any European
nation of a disposition on Its part to In
terfere in any manner In the present dis
pute between the United States and Tur
key over the American indemnity claims.
It may also be stated on the. best author
ity that none pf the representatives of
the European powers in Washington have
requested the State. Department to deliver
itself of any explanation of its intention
affecting Turkey, nor does our Govern
ment expect' any interference by third
parties in this matter so long as our
claims are confined to. their present per
fectly legitimate basfs. " '
All that can be stated by authority re
specting Mr. Grtscom's course at Constan
tinople is contained in the general declara
tion that he is pursuing instructions to
insist to. the, Turkish Government upon a
redemption of its promise to pay the
American indemnity claims. Naturally the
officials decline to Intimate what steps will
be resorted: to In case Mr. Griscom's re
i quest is denied. They prefer to believe
that the demand will meet. with success.
The phase \o bo feared is procrastination
on the 1 part of the Turkish Government
something harder to meet than an unqual
ified refusal to pay. It is understood that
Mr. Griscom Is., shaping -his representa
tions to the Porte with special reference
to the avoidance of this pitfall. .-
Ferrouh-Bey, the " Turkish Minister,
called at the State Department this after
noon and -spent - a 1a 1 half-hour in conversa
tion with Secretary - Hay. Beyond the
statement .that the indemnity claims were
the subject of discussion nothing official
could be ' learned of what took place be
tween the two. It is gathered - that : tha
Turkish effort 1b still in the direction of
finding some other means of escape from
the present situation than a cash settle
ment. Thus there Is belteved to be more
talk of the old proposition to build a Turk
ish cruiser here and settle the claims un
der the coverof such a transaction, but
whatever the' character of the details of
,the Turkish proposition, .It appears . that
ithere is no attempt to deny the obligation
assumed toward these claimants and em
bodied in the piomlses to Mr. Straus, and
consequently there has been no refusal to
pay the debt in some manner.
PARLIAMENT
AWAITS ACTION
BY ROBERTS
Herculean Efforts Being
Made to Reconstruct
Liberal Party.
American Complications With Tur
key the Gossip of London, but
No Serious Consequences
Are Expected.
____ Â¦ Â¦ ' Â¦ . : . â¢;
Copyrighted, 1900, by the Associated Â¦ Press.
LONDON. April 28.â Though the event
of the week in England has been the re
sumption of Parliament it scarcely justi
fied even passing- comment. Lethargy haa
marked and probably will continue to
mark the debates. Dissolution is in the
air, but all the members of the- House of
Commons now seem to realize that their.
happy release from Westminster depends
entirely upon the progress of : the war in
South Africa, although, as -' announced
weeks ago in these dispatches, until Lord
Roberts brings the campaign to a climax
the Government will continue to kill time,
adopting a non-committal attitude toward
any home measures that might engender
serious controversy and holding back any
announcement of any permanent policy
in regard to South Africa until the issue
of arms simplifies the multitudinous prob-.
lems involved. The Liberal papers in
veigh against this endeavor to secure
peace first and announce the policy after
ward, maintaining that a frank announce
ment of the Government's intentions .to
ward the South African republics would
greatly hasten peace.
However, the Liberals are fcr too hope
lessly divided on the war Question to have
any chance of forcing Lord Salisbury's
hand in this respect.' Thus the unimpor
tant situation is likely to define itself into
forgetfulness amid Liberal clamor that
the Government ' is' making deathbed re
pentance on international issues, and
when Lord Roberts breaks' the backbone
of the Boer resistance the Premier' will
spring a programme and go' before the
country. , . .-Jijy'o
Activity of Liberals.,
Judging from Lord Spencer's speech this
week, herculean efforts are being made
by the old-time Liberal leaders to recon
struct the party. Lord Spencer blessed
every Liberal section, but in the same
breath declared himself for Lord Rose
bery. That is the rock on which the Lib
erals split. The attitude of the former
Premier will probably have more effect
on the next election than any other cir
cumstance except the outcome of the war.
Strenuous efforts are making to bring
Lord Rosebery into 'active politics again
and within the fold of recognized party
lines, but so far they have met with no
success, as he cannot be persuaded to put
International policies above considerations
affecting the empire. While he stands
with the majority of the Liberal leaders
on local issues, he is bitterly at variance
upon imperial questions with a large body
of the party, especially the Forwards, or
more radical section. As Lord Rosebery
numbers among his followers Lord Spen
cer, Sir Henry Fowler, H. H. Asquith
and many other leaders, it can only be
surmised that the Conservatives will put
off the election until a moment most op
portune for themselves and then, faced
by the disintegration of opposition, sweep
the country even more completely than
at the last election.
The past week has witnessed a feeble
attempt to celebrate St. George's day with
the outward signs that marked St. Pat
rick's anniversary. One result was that
roses slightly increased in price (most of
them came from France), and there was
a sprinkling of flags. But on the whole
the efforts to celebrate England's patron
saint were by no means successful. Ex
cept by handling the gold coinage of the
realm few people, however, have any
knowledge of St. George, and in the pop
ular, mind, he retains only uninteresting
associations in which he is connected
with the mere conquest over the. dragon
portrayed on the sovereigns, which fails
to awaken enthusiasm in stolid England.
Complications With Turkey.
American complications with Turkey
continue the topic of the day. The Out
look, after declaring the Sultan and Isaac
Gordon, the notorious money lender who
died recently, were own brothers in mat
ters of money, says:
"The Sultan has now fallen back on
the desperate debtor's last device of buy
ing more and has offered to place an or
der for a warship with an American firm
if only the American Government^ will
accord him a- while longer. ButT the
American Government will do nothing of
the sort and grimly intimates that unless
the dollars are promptly forthcoming the
matter will be put in the hands of the
United States navy. Yet President Me-
Kinley's candidature may not, after all.
enjoy immense help from a naval demon
stration in -European waters, for the
European powers who are fellow â¢ suf
ferers with America and Armenia
are,- in wholesome imitation, taking
steps, to press their claims, and un
der such pressure Turkey must give
way. Russia, it Is true, is holding
aloof, but, menaced by Japan, she is
hardly likely to lend Turkey more than
diplomatic help."
During the course of a long article the
Speaker maintains that the difficulty is
chiefly due to the exploitation of the Con
tinental and American press and ridicules
the possibility of a serious outcome, say
ing: "The devH'B shadow promises to re
build, punish, tax and to do a hundred
things, but pay he cannot. Thereupon his
vision conjured up Admiral Dewey, of all
people, sailing into the Mediterranean
and occupying one of those ports, for. the
virtual neutrality of which the great
European powers are willing to risk the
chances of a great war among them
selves. It Js on a par with the boycott of
the French exhibition of the Don Paciflco
claim."
Richard Croker will remain in England
until after Derby day and neither politi
cal rumors nor personal paragraphs will
alter his determination to enjoy the Eng
lish spring racing season.

REVEALS THE
SECRET OF HER
LIFt'S TRAGEDY
Crown Prinoess Stephanie's
New Book Causes a
Sensation.
Portrays the Infelicities of Her
-First Marriage and Her Hus
band's Want of
Fidelity.
?
Special cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright, 1&00, by the Herald Pub
llshlne Company.
BERLIN, April 28.â Crown Princess Ste
phanie,' now the Countess Lonyay, has be
come an authoress. A few weeks ago an
iHustrated article by Her Imperial High
ness appeared in the work "The Austro-
Hungarian Monarchy in Pen and Pencil,"
which she edited with her husband. Crown
Prince Rudolf.
After the death of the Crown Prince,
Princess Stephanie herself took up the
editing of the work. The book has caused
a great sensation. It would be Interesting
even If the writer were not such a highly
placed personage, for it reveals the secrets
of woman's soulâ all that she suffers, her
hopes, fears, all the love she lost and that
which she found.
"When I think of the past," Countess
Lonyay writes, "I ask myself if I have
lived or dreamed. When one's life has
failed, deep in the heart there rises a
yearning for something unknownâ for
something endlessly sweet, for some
heaven-sent happiness which one feels,
but yet which one can never reach."
She early learned the shadowy side of
married life, and concerning her former
husband's want of fidelity she expresses
herself as follows: . -
"In a marriage where the husband is
completely blase, both heart and soul
with time become as empty as an egg
shell?" .
Much surprise was expressed and It was
regarded as a" mere conventloual act that
Crown Princess Stephanie often laid
flowers on the grave of her husband, who
died for the sake of her rival. But, as
was to be expected, her youth made the
Princess yearn for more life. Fate of
fered it to her. She writes:
"It is possible I have passed tfirough a
long, long and dark night, and now the
black, clouded sky Is flushed with the ris
ing light and gleam of hope which pre
sages the splendor of the sun. Will it rise
in dazzling beauty? Shall I bask in its
warm beams, and will it kiss tears from
my cheeks? Come, oh, sun, come. You
will find a poor, wretched, almost withered
rose which the hand of fate has stripped
of thorns." â¢ Â¦ . ?
It becomes clear that she has decided
on the final step.
"Two young people see each other for
the first time, know each other for a quar
ter of an hour and then utter words which
bind them till death doth them part"
Her struggle to realize her new life is
thus described:
"Parents, friends, all desert me one by
one How often does one's heart bleed in
having to respect narrow laws of so
called conventional morality?"
The Crown Princess addresses the fol
lowing poem to her daughter:
Tbe evenlns bell iÂ» softly ringing:
Across tha peaceful vale to me:
I would its nlstant chimes were brlnglns
My greeting from afar to thee.
Ths sun Is sinking: slowly westward.
The glistening moonlight nils the air,
- And heavenward floats on angel pinions
. For thee my silent evening prayer.

Oliver H. P. Belmont returned from
Europe to-day. He has been absent two
month* and most of his time has been
spent in Paris. Since his departure from
these shores the candidacy of Admiral
Dewey for President has been announced.
"It was with regret." said Mr. Belmont

Press Comments Show a
Marked Change of
Attitude.

of the German
Empire.

BERLJN. April Â£Â«.â lnterest in the
South African war has flagged, owing to
the lack of exciting nws. The semi
official Milltair Wochensb'.att says it is
Impossible to grain a clear idea of the
present status there "because of the want
of concentrated efforts on both Fidf-s.
the actions being small and scattered,
probably ov.ing to Lord Roberts' mistake
in believing that the southern half of the
Orange Free State was pacified, whereas
numerous commandos are evidently form
ing there constantly."
During the week the German press paid
great attention to the relations between
Great Britain and Germany, and it was
Interesting to note that even such an An-
ClophCbe paper as the Hamburger Xach
richten added "it was foolish to needless
ly anger and provoke England," and ad
vised the German people to "use more
wisdom and circumspection when criticiz
ing the English or the war."
It Us also significant that the Govern
ment organ, the North German Gazette,
reproduced the fon&going article.
The Vossische Zfitung came out with
an editorial, eemi-excuFing itself for pre
vious utterances and claiming that what
the German press had been doing was,
only giving the British good advice in
criticizing the war. otherwise remaining
friendly to England.
The whole Government press now simul
taneously prints pro-British arguments,
evidently navir.g received a cue from ;
headquartprs. It is quite true that the
Emperor has all along been pro-English.}
He regards friendly and even intimate |
relations between the two countries as j
one of the cornerstones of his policy. i
The correspondent of the Associated I
Press has from time to time furnished j
proof of this. His Majesty's latest cvi- j
dences in this line are his personal utter- ;
ances, the knowledge of which has not j
penetrated beyond his immediate sur- j
roundings, but it is said that they are ;
all confirmatory of his pro-British feel- ,
The Emperor is of one mind with the j
Foreign Affairs Minister, Count yon Bu- |
low, and both of them have been strength- i
ened in their views by the behavior of i
France and Russia since the South Afri- I
can war bfgan. They have also been lnflu- j
enced by the attitude of the United States
toward Great Britain since the beginning
of the war. his Majesty being a tirm be
liever in a cordial understanding between
Great Britain, the United States and Ger
many. He has not scrupled to give ex- |
pression to this conviction during the past |
year to both the British Embassador, Sir |
Francis Lascelles, and the United States
Embassador. Andrew C. White. It is need
less to say that this policy is wholly dis
approved of by the Agrarians, who are
putting out that the late Prince Bismarck
always thought Russia was Germany's
beÂ«=t friend.
The pfmi-official Post, correctine the
views expressed by part of the British
and American press that a strong anti-
American feeling is prevailing in Ger
many, concludes:
"It is true the war with Spain, which
began without sufficient cause, was more I
heverely condemned, but now that peace
is restored we endeavor to be just to the
Americans, not being blind to their feel
ings, but admitting their great achieve
ment* in every department of life. Tha
United States has stepped into the rank
of the world powers and we do not know
why Germany should show animosity,
since both powers, rather, should go to
Fame paces."
The visit of the Emperor to Prince yon
Furstenberg was partially undertaken in
order to gain a correct id<*a of the actual
status of the German language and na
tional strife in Austria before meeting
Emperor Francis Joseph, with whom he
will converse on the subject.
The North German Gazette prints fie:
ures showing that financially the year 1R99
was the most successful since the founda
tion of the German empire. The surplus
over the estimates was sixty million
marks, in pplte of the larger expenditures
for the navy.

PARIS. April 28.â A famine of clean
linen is more disturbing to Parisians than
the incomplete condition of the exposition
grounds. Eight thousand Paris washer
women have struck, for higher wages and
shorter hours and serious inconvenience
ha*s already been caused. The hotel man
ager-! and keepers of restaurants bitterly
complain that half their linen is not re
turnt<l from the wash, and private fam
ilies are also feeling the pinch. The strike
commenced at Boulogne-Sur-Seine sind
spread to several other environs where
laundries are situated. The laundry work
people around Paris number between 20,000
and 30.000, and if the strikers succeed in
securing; their adhesion the mass of Paris
ians will have to go unwashed. The fact
that the influx of visitors to the exposi
tion is begun, necessitating heavy de
mands on the laundries, gave the washer
women an opportunity to put the screws
on their employers, who naturally are
much incensed by this attempt to force
their hands now, when they have already
concluded contracts in many cases with
hotels, restaurants and other establish
ments for tho exposition season at deter
mined rates.
Refuse to Compromise.
I The masters offered a partial increase of
j wages, but the strikers thus far have re
fused to compromise. Bands of work peo
ple gather in the neighborhood of the
! laundries where work is still partially
'continued and try to persuade the non
strikers to join them. No serious disorder
j has yet occurred, but the police are lak
i ing precautions and detachments of
I gendarmes have been drafted to the dis-
I tricts where trouble is possible.
This ebullition of labor difficulties calls
; attention to the serious possibility of
much graver disturbances arising from
i the throwing on the labor market of thou
sands of workmen by the completion of
! the exhibition and of the central portion
jof the new Metropolitan Railway, These
I great undertakings attracted to Paris vast
| numbers of provincial carpenters, masons,
painters and unskilled laborers, and the
I problem the Government has now to face
i is the dispersal of these men through the
I country or to avoid a great labor crisis in
I Paris, the consequences of which It would
Ibe difficult to foresee. The first measure
â¢ of the Government has been to post at all
( centers of work placards enumerating un
' dertakings in the provinces directed by
the Minister of Public Works. It is esti
! mated that three days will absorb about
j 12.000, and free transportation will be
given to the places where the men are
required. There still, however, remains
a large number for whom jobs are wanted.
The acting secretary of the Labor Ex
change calculated that 60,000 workmen
came to Paris last year. Of this number
perhaps two-thirds intend to return to
their homes.
The secretaries of the various trads
unions take a more pessimistic view of
the situation. The secretary of the paint
ers' organization reckoned that the com
pletion of the exposition will leave over
10,000 painters alone unemployed, while a
I committeeman of the unskilled laborers'
i union claims that thte number of that
. class who will be thrown on the streets
will reach 20,000, few of whom will con-
I sent to go to the provinces. This latter
' reluctance is an important factor In the
j crisis, as the countrymen, intoxicated by
\ the glitter of the metropolis, are disposed
â¢ to hang on as long as possible.
Order Out of Chaos.
The fortnight's work on the Exposition
since the opening has done much to
j bring order out of chaos which obtained
: when President Loubet declared the Ex-
I position open. Perceptible progress is
j neing made daily, and sight-seers can
find sufficient to repay them for the
I trouble of a visit. The galleries are fill-
I ing up with the exhibits, which are being
rapidly installed. The foreign sections
Â¦ in this respect are further advanced than
i France's own building, and the American
i exhibits are keeping well abreast of those
of other countries. Most of the foreign
national pavilions now are on the eve
of Inauguration, and several have been
i opened, Bosnia and Hungary being the
! latest to unclose their doors. Both of
I these offer charming Interiors, and are
I characteristically and artistically repre-
I sentative of their respective countries.

TROUBLE OVER
APPOINTMENT
OF GIRIMONDI
Much Comment Follows the
Naming of Consul to
Santos.
Â»
Is a Roman Catholic Priest, but Has
Aroused the Enmity of His
Churchmen in Wash
ington.
Bpeclal Dirpatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL. Washington. April 28.-
Much comment haÂ« followed the belated
announcement that Dr. J. J. Girlmondi,
lately appointed by President Mcivinley
and conlirmÂ«d as Consul to Santos, Bra
zil, is a secular priest of the Roman Cath
olic Church. It is not so much the fact
thut Girimondi is the first priest to be
Riven a Consular position that has occa
sioned the talk as that he has incurred
the bitter enmity of m<uiy belonging to
tne priesthood of Washington. Dr. Giri
mor.di twice c.-iIU-d to pay his respects to
-\lpr. jsartinel:i. I'apa; representative in
.America, and both Urnes he was refused
an auriionce.
Another strange phase of this remark
al?!e Incident is thai while priests of this
< ty assert that Dr. Girimondi belongs in
St. Paul to the archdiocese of Archbishop
Ireland, he is credited. In his appointment,
to California. He had the solid support
for the appointment of the California del
egation, ail of th<Â» members of which ex
press ifrnorance a* to his church anteced
ents ai.d are surprised to learn that he
tx-Ic-ngs to the priesthood. One close lo
l'zesident McKinley to-day gave full au
thority for the assertion that when Dr.
<Â»iriir:ondl received his appointment the
I 'resident did not know tnat he was a
j riest.
The reeling is that deception has been
practiced, und some one will certalnlv be
oallfHi upon for an explanation. This is
ail the more likely because of the opposi
tion to Dr. Girimondi within his own
church, some of the Washington priests
even poing so far as to predict that the
P'-pe wili interfere.
Senator Perk ns to-night said that he
had recommended Dr. Giriraondl for ap
jxnntment. adding that he had the support
of the entire Fr^nrb. Spanish and Italian
colonies of San Francisco. He expressed
preat surprise when told he belonged to
the priesthood.
Representative Kahn said he had known
Girimondi many years, and this was the
first timi he had ever heard of his being
a priest.

SUIT TO PREVENT THE

TOPEKA, Kas., April 28.â Attorney
General Goddard left .to-day for Wash

preme Court an injunction suit in the
name of the State of Kansas against tho
State of Colorado to prevent the diversion
of the water of the Arkansas River from
its natural channel. For several years
past numerous irrigating companies, do
ing business under charters granted by

at the Instance of these counties and
upon the authority of Governor Stanley.
The Supreme Court will be asked to for
bid the granting of further franchises
and to enjoin the State of Colorado from
renewing those already In existence.
The estimated value of the property in
volved in the suit is J75.000.0fi0. and about
2.fa.K).000 acres of land are affected.

aragua Canal by the Government.
We heartily favor the construction of good
roads, and urge upon the Legislature the adop
tion of such laws as will cause the speedy and
permanent construction of the same wherever
practicable.
We adopt the following language, used by
President McKinley in his Inaugural address
as the sentiment of this league on the subject
of trusts:
"The declaration of the party now restored
to power has been In the past that of opposition
to all combinations of capital, organized in
trusts or otherwise,, to control arbitrarily the
condition of trade amonc our citizens; and It
has supported it In such legislation as will pre
vent the execution of all schemes to opprees
the people by undue charges on their supplies,
or by unjust rates for the transportation of
their products to market. This purpose will be
steadily pursued by the enforcement of the
laws now in existence and the recommendation
and support of such new statutes aa may be
necessary to carry it into effect."
Republican clubs and organizations should be
requested to appoint special committees who
shall be charged with the duty of calling upon
and urging nil Republicans to Immediately
register for the coming elections, as the law
now requires that there must be an entirely new
registration In every county of the State. Un
der the primary election law primary elections
will be held in every county on the 2d of
August next for the election of delegates to
the State convention to nominate Presidential
Electors, district conventions to nominate rep
resentatives in Congress and local conventions
to nominate judicial officers and Senators li\
the odd-numbered districts and members of
the Assembly.
Every effort should be made by all Repub
lican organizations to take all necessary meas
ures to thoroughly educate the voter on the
provisions of the law. which gives him every
opportunity to exercise his choice freely for
delegates for conventions nominating candi
dates for public office.
We would most earnestly urge upon the at-
belief in and devotion to the teachings, tradi
tions and historical principles of the Republi
can party and we especially emphasize our
allegiance to the principles enunciated In the
Republican National Convention, adopted in
St. Louis in 1895.
We believe that the laboring, producing and
manufacturing interests of the l T nited States
can only be maintained by the wise and Judl
, clous enforcement of the well-tried and thor
: oughly established Republican policy of pro
tection to American labor and American in
dustry-
We earnestly and heartily endorse the wise,
able and patriotic administration of President
McKlnley and declare that the Republicans of
California unanimously favor his renomlnatlon
and re-election.
We earnestly commend the action of the Re
publican administration and the Republican
majority in Congress In providing for a civil
government In < the Island of Porto Rico, and
thus early placing the military under the ju
risdiction of the civil power, and in the course
pursued in dealing with Cnba and the Philip
pine Islands.
We heartily commend and endorse the able
and courageous administration of Governor
Henry T. Gage, and sanction his wise action
in enforcing economy and efficiency in the
management of the several public institutions
of the State, resulting in a great saving to the
public treasury and materially lightening the
burdens of taxation.
We favor the constitutional amendment, now
pending In Congress, providing for the elec
tion of United States Senators by direct vote
of the people.
We commend the action of Congress In pro
viding for laying a Pacific cable from Califor
nia to the Hawaiian Islands, and we favor the

ROOT'S WORDS
DIRECTED AT
THE KAISER
Had Germany in Mind When
He Spoke of Future
Warfare.
Berlin Government Believed to Have
Its Eyes Fixed Upon Territory
In the Western Hemi
sphere.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLING
TON HOTEL, WASHINGTON. April 2S.â
Secretary Root's sensational declaration
at the Grant dinner last nlpht that the
American Government will scon be called
upon to forcibly uphold the Monroe doc
trine was leveled, It is said by administra
tion officials, at the Government whose
eyes are fixed upon territory In the West
ern Hemisphereâ Germany.
Coming from the Secretary of War thÂ«
statements made are regarded here a=? of
the gravest import, and occasioned con
siderable comment on the part of mem
bers of the diplomatic corps. In only one
respect may they prove injurious to the
United States. The German Emperor may
use them as a new argument, in support
of his naval bill. State Department aÂ«l
vlces show the chances of the passage of
this measure decidedly slim, and that it
needs some external emergency to induce
the members of the Reichstag to vet? for
the enormous naval increase proposal by
the Emperor. According to a diplomat
familiar with the German people and Ger
man affairs, t'ae measure would t? over
whelmingly passed were the United States
to give an affront to the Berlin Govern
ment or to take action which might dem
onstrate the need of a stronger German
navy. But it is hoped by the administra
tion that Germany will need the warning
which the Secretary of War has so adroit
ly given. There have been many straws
which have reached the State Department
to indicate the trend of the Kaiser s am
bition with respect to the Western Hemi
sphere.

The man tangled in the tape from

business man. His business cares
wrap him about like the coils of a
constrictor and slowly crush out his
life. The common 6ign of the busi-

rapid eating, the indigestible pastry,
the coffee and pie or doughnuts,
with which many a man stuffs his
stomach under the name of "quick

a strong stomach and sound health
is to use Dr. Pierce* Golden Med-

GRIDIRON CLUB
IN A PARODY
ON POLITICS
Â¦ ?
Washington Correspondents
Hold a National
Convention.
Nominate McKinley and Bryan and
Drop Dewey Into the "Hole
. iii the Bottom of
the Sea."
WASHINGTON, April 28.â The Gridiron
Club had a national convention to-night,
and the Washington correspondents com
posing that organization scored a "beat"
on the parties which will nominate candi
dates for the Presidency.
There was general satire In the state
ment of President West that all details,
such as the selection of temporary and
permanent officers, appointment of com
mlttees, etc., had all been arranged be
forehand. . ââ
"What kind of a convention Is this?
asked a member of the club.
"A convention on the Philadelphia
plan," was the reply. "The delegates have
nothing to do but to furnish the enthu
siasm.
This seemed, however, to be perfectly
satisfactory, for then and there appeared
the Gridiron Marching Club, carrying red
white and blue campaign umbrellas and
wearing linen dusters. After repeating,
like a college yell, the fact that they were
friends of McKlnley, the club marched out
and immediately reappeared, shouting
with equal enthusiasm for Bryan. The
"marching club" was preceded by two
musicians playing a fife and drum in true
campaign style.
"Collapse of the Platform."
The latest member of the club, Henry
G. Kemp of the Baltimore Sun, was in
troduced as the club's hero, and entered
wearing an admiral's uniform. After he
had been presented a wreath, a sword and
other trifles, he mounted a platform, re
turned his thanks, accepted the nomina
tion and declared himself the people's can
didate. At that moment his platform
collapsed and the choir sang, with lugu
brious voice, "There's a" Hole In the Bot
tom of the Sea."
The April dinner of the club was based
on the convention Idea. Over the doors to
the banquet hall were the words "Gridiron
Convention," and everything that followed
was on the national convention order in
gridiron style.
The idea of a convention was carried
out in the elaborate decorations. The
paneled oak ceiling and the mirrored walls
of the banquet-room were swathed in
flags and bunting, while at Intervals along
the tables were staffs and banners bear
ing the names and coats of arms of the
States. The resemblance of a convention
hall was complete. The floral display was
also very fine. There was a delicious fra
grance of spring blossoms in the room, as
well as a glory of color to delight the eyes.
Amid so much bunting and floral effect
a few plainly printed placards, bearing
more or less flippant but appropriate le
gends, were conspicuous. "Admiral
Dewey's Headquarters, Parlor 131, Hanna,
Quay and Reform," etc.
The menu souvenirs were fac-similes of
convention tickets, being handsome and
unique, and were brought in by two
"sound delegates," who were alleged to
have been trying to sell them on the out
side.
Nominate Themselves.
There was a platform, of course. It was
a Jumble of nonsensical phrases, patterned
after the usual extravagant declarations
of political conventions, but it was not
adopted, a substitute being adopted in the
shape of a gridiron platform, made of lit
tle planks. Governor Roosevelt was im
personated as a Rough Rider with great
success.
The speeches were excellent, one of the
novelties about them being the nomination
by some of the principal speakers of them
selves.
Among the guests who spoke were ex-
Senator Gorman. Senators Allison, Depew.
Carter and Hanna and Representatives
Allen and Dalzell.
The guests Included Secretary of State
Hay. Secretary Long of the navy. Secre
tary of the Interior Hitchcock, Postmas
ter General Smith, M. D. Provand. M. P.;
Colonel J. L. Torrey of Wyoming, Thomas
F Walsh of Colorado. Hugh C. Wallace
of Tacoma. W?sh., and many Senators
and Representatives and others prominent
in olflcfal life. _^_

MERRIAM OK
THE WARDHER
INQUIRY GRILL
General Explains His In-
structions From the War
Department.
Admits That Ha Adopted No Means
of Determining the Guilt or
Innocence of Itfiners
Arrested.
WASHINGTON. April 2S.â The examin
ation of General Mc-rrlam was continued
at tha Coeur d'Alene investigation by the
Military Committee of the House to-day.
He explained in detail his instructions. In
a telegram from Secretary Alger, of May
81. he had referred to General Merriam'a
"original Instructions." General Merriam
testified that he hud never received any
"original instructions" beyond the direc
tion to proceed to Idaho to put down the
insurrection. He had applied to the de
partment twice for the "original instruc
tions," but they had not been furnished,
and hÂ« had come to the conclusion that
Secretary Alger -vas In error. Regarding
tbÂ« incident of the pump men at the Tiger
and Poorman mines, he eald Governor
Steucenber* had aeited what could be
done to save the mines in case they de
clined to take out permits. He had re
plied that he did not feel competent to
tulvise. He knew that to have allowed
the mine to be filled with water would
hare destroyed it as effectively as to have
blown it up with dynamite.
Attorney Robertson conducted the cross
examination of General Merriam. In le
ply to a series of questions. General Mer
riam tÂ«Â»USed that martial law was de
clared by the Governor of Idaho, upon
whose request the United States troops
were furnished, and that the section of
the Revised Statutes requiring the Presi
dent to proclaim a etate of Insurrection
<il<l not apply. Some of the Federal troops,
he testified, were in Idaho and some on
tbelr way there before martial law was
declared. He had telegraphed on May 1
to the War Department that ha would ex
ercise martial law If the action was not
disapproved by the department.
"Was that your intention?" asked Rob
ertson.
"It was," replied General Merriam, "but
It "was not exercised. It was my intention
to scrutinize travel outward bound from
the scene of the trouble. The Governor
proclaimed martial law on March 30."
Up to the time of his arrival 13S arrests
had been made. Robertson sought to get
an admission that some of these arreAs
were made prior to the Governor's procla
mation, but General Merriam denied this
emphatically, producing his telegrams to
â¢how that when he ordered the arrests
he stated martial law was declared. When
he directed that arrests should be made
by deputies he had not conceded that
troops could not make the arrests directly
and without warrants under military law.
"Do you think that under the conditions
that obtained in the Coeur d'Alene it was
proper and reasonable to hold prisoners
from four to six months without examina
tion?"
"1 am not prepared to answer 'no, re
plied General Merriam. "I don't know
all the attending circumstances and con
ditions."
"Did you take any means to determine
the probable innocence of prisoners for
your own information or that of the Pres
ident of the United States?"
"No further than to urge preliminary
examinations by the civil authorities."
"You convened no military court to try
tho*e prisoners?"
"I did not. The State courts were
"You took no pains to determine
wtoether or not information had been
lodged apainst the men arrested?"
J"l did hot."
"You then lent soldiers to deputies who
made arrests?"
"I did not. I sent soldiers to protect
deputies and to receive and safeguard
prisoners. "
"Do you think there can be civil officers
under martial law?"
"I do, emphatically."
"Deputies exercising the functions of
military officers?"
"Yes; under the direction of the Gover
nor."
G<?n< ral Merriam in response to a ques
tion a* to whether he now considered the
pÂ«<jple of fihoshone County capable of
self-poverament said he was not in pos
session of sufficient Information to giv*
an opinion.
Without completing the cross-examina
tion of General Merriam the committee
adjourned until Monday.

17Supervisor Helms has progressed far enough in his
advocacy of the racetracks and all they entail in dis
tress and dishonor to the city to suggest that he is
well qualified to organize a society for the suppression
of virtue.
American citizenship appears at last to have won an
international value. Many resident foreigners who
intend visiting the Paris Exposition are making their
preliminary declaration as American citizens before
they go.
The local shoemaker who bet and lost on his belief
that he could write English is probably convinced
now that there was much of truth in that old adage
that the shoemaker should stick to his last.
In his lifetime very few people heard much of the
millions of the late Georpe Smith, the American mil
lionaire who recently did in London, but since liis
death his estate has made him famous by reason of
the enormous inheritance taxes taken out of it. The
British treasury took $5,000,000 to begin with, then
the New York inheritance tax took $1.9.34.753. an.i it
i.Â« 'lid the United States Government viill take about
?-,000.000 more. The error of Mr. Smith was in leav
ing a large estate, with no children to inherit it, for
the taxes on collateral inheritances are high; and he
made a further mistake in investing his estate in one
country and making his will in another, thus giving
two nations a whack at it. It is to be remembered,
however, that the old man being dead will not miss
the money, and those to whom the fortune falls need
not take it if they think the tax too high.
Recent developments indicate that as female im
personators members of the Police Department are
not glittering successes. Chief Sullivan might ad
var.tageously use the excess "talent" in the depart
ment by (riving us a farce comedy with his office as
the central scene.
Germany has decided that our agricultural products
shall not be admitted within the lines of the Father
land. This seems particularly unkind after we have
been buying German guns with which to enforce
American demands.

Mission Bay Tract Will Be Needed
When Its Coast Gap Is Com
pleted.
The fifteen acres of marsh and laguna,
which were formerly a part of Mission
Bay. bounded by Fourth, Kentucky and
Channel streets and the base of Potrero
Heights, is to be filled in. A contract was
secured yesterday by Henry A. Whitney,
secretary of the Potrero Land and De
velopment Company, from the Southern
Pacific Company to do this work.
The piece of property mentioned was
given to the railroad company by the
State Legislature some years ago to be
used as a yard for the company 7*7 * rolllae
etock. A part of this property w u filled
In several years ago. To complete its
present work will necessitate the removal
of about 2M.000 cubic yards of earth,
which will be taken from the Develoo
ment Company's bluerock hill opposite
the Union Iron Works.
The chief reason for filling In this prop
erty at the present time ia that the rail
road company will need It when trains
are running regularly over the new line
between this city and Los Angeles. Pas
sengers from the south will then com*
here direct instead of by way of Oakland
A CURIOUS LAW QUESTION.
O BERLIN M. CARTER, late captain of the
United States army, convicted of gross frauds
in swindling the Government in the construc
tion of improvements at the harbor of Savannah, has
at last entered a Federal prison and begun his term
of servitude. So far as he is concerned, therefore,
the sensational case ends in a triumph for law over
influences sufficiently strong to baffle it for years. In
the meantime, however, the case has taken on a new
phase, involving other parties, which promises to be
as remarkable as that attending the trial of Carter
In the frauds which Carter was convicted of com
1 mitting he did not act alone. Certain wealthy con
! tractors residing in New York are accused of being
j associated with him. Last December a Federal Grand
i Jury in the district in which Savannah is situated in
| dieted five of these contractors as parties to the con
spiracy to defraud, and an effort was made to arrest
them in New York and take them to Savannah for
trial. By dilatory proceedings before a United States
Commissioner in New York the accused men man
aged to delay the law so long that early in this month
the Savannah Grand Jury made a formal presentment
: of the case to Congress calling attention to the evi
dent attempt to save the accused men from trial.
I Shortly after this presentment was made Judge
! Brown of New York refused to issue a warrant for
the removal of the indicted men to the jurisdiction of
the Federal court at Savannah.
The case has naturally attracted a good deal of at
tention. It is sufficiently notable in itself to cause
remark, but coming as it does as a sequel to tht
notorious Carter case, its interest is augmented. It
appears that the ring which was so powerful as to
nearly clear Carter is once more at work on behalf
of the contractors and is still sufficiently potent to
delay justice, even if it do not defeat it altogether.
The action of the New York Judge in refusing to
surrender the indicted men to the court at Savannah
is said to have excited a good deal of indignation at
Washington. It is stated that the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General have openly denounced the
decision and will take steps to have it reversed. Â« It
appears, however, there is now no power of law by
j which the officers of the Government can compel the
New York courts to surrender the men to the. Sa
vannah court, and accordingly a bill has been intro
duced into Congress to confer the power. The meas-
SUPERVISOR HELMS is one of those men
who can learn nothing from what is going
on around them. With a stubbornness which
argues something like a mental incompeter.cy to
profit by the teaching of experience, he ignores all
that the Police Courts and the Morgue records re
veal of the effects of track gambling, confronts the
indignation of all good citizens, defies public opinion,
and pushes himself forward as the champion and ad
vocate of the gamblers.
At the meeting of the Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors on Thursday Helms expressed
a determination to submit an order permitting horse
racing for a period of sixty days and allowing pool
selling within the inclosure. He endeavored to in
duce the committee to recommend the order, but
failed in the effort, and thereupon announced his in
tention to take the case before the full board.
If Helms and men like him have not learned the
evil results of track gambling by what has taken
place in this city within a time comparatively short
it is hardly likely that anything would teach them,
and argument would probably be thrown away if ad
dressed to them. We have had defalcations, em
bezzlements, frauds, robberies, suicides and murders
resulting from, track gambling, and some of these
crimes are of such recent occurrence that the com
munity has not yet recovered from the shock.
There is little danger that Helms' order will 'be
sustained by a majority of the board. There are not
many men of his type in the city, and it is hardly
likely there can be more than one or two of them
on the board. The people and the officials of San
Francisco have had enough of track gambling for
the rest of the lifetime of this generation. We have
contributed enough to the nefarious profits of the
Eastern sports and have yielded them an ample
number of victims as fugitives from justice, convicts
and suicides. As an advocate of the gamblers Super
visor Helms may discredit himself, but he can do
nothing more. In San Francisco the track gambling
issue has been made up and closed along with the
tracks.

THE WARDNER TROUBLE.
NOTHING more shameless has ever occurred ia
American p'-!.t::s than the attempt of Con
greiirr.ezi Lentz and Sulzer to make po:iticai
capital ag*:r.-_: the President cut of the declaration of
marua: .i- a: Aarlner, in Ica.no, ana tr.e Â£er.c:r:g o:
regular troops there by the Secretary- of War on de
mand or tnt government ct the itate.
Ler.tz procured the appointment ci an investigating
committee by the House to look into the affair and
throw out a dragnet for party cap:tal to use ia the
campaign. Governor Steunenberg of Idaho was
califi as a witness and underwent a direct and cross
exasrinatxoa laiting twelve days. He declared him
self tolejj responsible for the declaration of martial
la-*- and for the presence of the troops. He (bowed
that under the law the President had to send them
when he as Governor officially demanded their pres
ence to suppress an insurrection, which he said ex
isted at Wardner. On cross-examination he dis
tinctly assumed responsibility for every detail and in
cio^nt cf the military occupancy and conduct. If
any act transcended the law, he assumed responsibility
aho for that. He proved that the President desired
to withdraw the troops after a certain time, but that
he protested against this and demanded their reten
tion. Whatever fault there may have been in his
judgment and policy, Governor Steuner.berg en
trenched himself in the respect of all fair-minded men
by shirking nothing and taking responsibility for all
that was dene.
Lent* ar.d S f sher were spiteful, indecent and in
sulting in their demeanor throughout the Governor's
testimony, ar.d since it was finished and had cut every
particle cf ground from under them they have con
tinued to mouth furiously about a conspiracy of the
President and Secretary of War to suppress the civil
la*' in Idaho.
Such puppy politics will deceive no one. Governor
Steonenberg is a firm Silver Democrat ar.d has been
twice elected by a Populist fusion? He is a prominent
candidate for the United States Senate, and if h's
party win in the next election he will succeed Shoup
ir. that office.
If wrong were done at Wardner he has said under
oath thst he and not the President did it. If Lentz
and Sulzer h2ve any issue it is against the Demo
cratic-Populist Governor of Idaho and not against
the Republican Present of the United States.
In other words, it i? not the Republican party that
is responsible, but the Populist- Democratic party,
%nd the two demagogue leaders of that party in the
House have made a laughing stock of themselves.
ADVrZETISX^LZZrrS.
for Â¦ the protection of the rights of the people cf
Washington City, and in Oakland the merchants
have had to undertake a movement for a better service
there. It is the same everywhere, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific seaboard. The regulation of telephone
corporations for the purpose of putting a stop to their
extortions and compelling a better service has be
come a necessity of the time.
On Monday, then, the people expect the Super
visor? to put an end in this city to the frauds com
mitted by the company in demanding payment for
service which frequently 13 never rendered. The
amount of money exacted in that way from the
patrons of the nickel-in-the-slot telephone machines
nay not be large frcm any particular individual, but
in the aggregate it runs up to a considerable sum
t\-try week. It is. moreover, one of the most irritat
ing forms in which petty swindling can be practiced,
and has now become well nigh intolerable.
The officials of the corporation have intimated ho^v
they propose to treat the effort to obtain justice.
One has suggested that any tax levied upon the cor
poration will be "put in the bill" of the patrons of
the corporation, and another has intimated that if the
company be required to furnish a switch before ex
acting the r.ickel ! it will give such an inadequate ser
vice as will induce the public to return to the old way.
Such threats should not deter the Supervisors in
doing their duty. If the corporation officials carry
out the threats they *il! furnish new incentives to
the people to amend the charter so as to give the
municipal authorities power to regulate telephone cor
porations in the same way as other corporations con
trolling ar.d operating public utilities are regulated.
There should then be no further postponement of the
issue. On Monday the Supervisors should act.
IN kis jp-tech at Wichita Colonel Bryan treated
things in his csnal light and airy fashion, and as
csual assumed that everybody is waiting to hear j
Sitting outside of himself a$ a part of the audience
enraptured with him, he said: "The public wanders
why I have dropped the silver question. New meas
cres are resting cjon us, uzi I sr^-.l neTer cÂ«p t-
silver question until the little coterie ct English
financiers cease to meet in secret and cake laws for j
Say there is 2 statement of fact. It is either true j
or false. What evidence has 2ryan cr any supporter j
of h:s that a little coterie, of Englishmen meet in .
secret and make laws for this country? Who com
pose this coterie? Whit taws do they make? Why
do they wish to make any laws for this country?
The statement h a falsehood atsd is used merely ss ;
an appeal to prejudice.
In such appeals Bryan is a past master. He never
csade a icgrcal argurr.tr.: ro hi? life. He doesn't j
know a syllogism from a p:ed mule.
Englar.i t.zz never had any interest in our adop
tion of the gotd standard. Ker interests financially
have been with silver and Mr. Bryan, because that j
left her the leading gc!d stir.iard natron 01 the wor^d
in-i made London the clearing-house of the planet.
Our adoption of the gold standard threatens her i
ftrrenrfal primacy. It threatens to transfer the settle
meat of balances from London to New York. If we
bad ceÂ£nite:y adopted the go'-i stancird on our re- ;
sttmptkm of specie payments in 1879, and Bryan bad |
takes to the pulpit cr the Â«tage, by this time we |
would have tttr. the leading creditor nation and NeÂ« |
Vcrk vocld hive been the world's dearing-hoase.
In the same speech Bryan threw a kiss to the Popu-
Iht;, saying: "Tr.e East no longer regards Populists
as ar.irchiits. but has come to respect them." Of
corrse this refers to the Popu*.:s:j who are willing to
support Bryan fcr the Presidency conditioned npoo
'-.- forcing the Democracy to adopt Populist prin
c:: â¢-. Â¦ Each he hi? so far succeeded in doing.
But the gem of his Wichita oratory was tÂ£:s: "In
the great contests that are fought between kingdom;
and republics we know where to pl2ce the heart? Â«
Arrrri-rir.s. It is '-o to-d^y with the Boers, and I do
ret s^y that becanse I ara against England, for I am
ps.rt Er:g:i;h myself, also part Irish and part Scotch,
but above a!! I am an American-"
No other public man. aspiring to the Presidency,
has ever said anything as delkiously and demagogi
cally funny 2s that. He wishes to stand well with zll'
rationalities and so pedigrees himself back to the
British Isles. He is English. Irish ar.d Scotch,
an^ wants the vote of each nationality. Hi; sympa
thies are with the Boer? because their country is a re
public, not because England is treating them unju-stly.
If Er.g!and were treating a weak monarchy as bad?y
as she i; treating those weak republics. Bryan leaves
; it to be inferred that he would be indifferent to the
i?;ue. or would perhaps let his one-fourth British
I blood lead him into the support of England. His
! treatment of the Boer issue i* characteristic of his
Â¦ illogical habit of thought. He has no sense of ab-
I stract justice at all. The rights of the Boers are set
; tied, in his view, by their form of government. Re
[ publics are right always, is his rips conclusion, and
\ then he turns on the republic of the United States
[ ard condemns everything it has done since he was
- born ard denounces everything it is doing now. In
i this damnatory pan of his speech he condemns this
I republic for "its notorious secret alliance with Great
. Britain."
What evidence has he of any alliance with Great
,' Britain? How can the same matter be secret and
. notorious? If it is secret he can know nothing about
j it. If it is notorious, that means that evidence of it
!is common knowledge. Where is such evidence?
This, like his "small coterie" in London, is a false
i hood ar.d a demagogue's appeal to prejudice.
The only notorious alliance between Americans
ar.d Englishmen that has ever existed is that between
Eriti-h and Bryan free traders. The only English
interference in American politics has been to induce
this country to adopt free trade and turn its market
over to Great Britain.- Bryan's party is the only po
litical party in this republic that ever had a British
alliance. Great Britain never as badly needed that
alliance a; now. Under our protection policy we are
rot only crowding England out of her foreign mar
kets, but we are pressing hard upon her at home.
Commercially we have her down, and her sole hope
of getting on her feet again is in the election of Mr.
Eryart and the decadence of our commerce under
free trade.

Colonel Duller, who says he Is the In

of Belgium, and has lived in England for
the last twenty years. He served in the
English army in Egypt. "In 18*2."- he
says, "I was attached to the British cav
alry staff In Egypt. It was while holding
this position that I invented khaki. Ne
cessity was the mother of this, as It ha*
been of all Inventions. I was robbed of all

THE EXCUSE FAILED
Charles Miller, a Standard Oil magnate
whose home Is in Franklin, Pa., has &
precocious son less than 10 years old In
whom hard business cense and worldly
caution are highly developed, says thÂ»
Philadelphia Evening Post. One day Mr.
Miller said to his son:
"My boy. It's time for you to go to bed.
I want you to get up bright and early to
morrow and go to church with me."
"I don't think 1 care about going to
ch .H^ to-morrow," replied Master Miller.
"Why not?"
"Last Sunday the preacher Â«ald hÂ© waa
going to preach about the devil."
"Well?*

But the boy went to church In Â«plte of
his clever excuse.
Berolzhime Not Dead.
A dispatch published from New York,
dated April 1. stated that Mrs. Catherine
Jordan, famous for years as one of the
handsomest women on the Pacific Coast,
wa3 found dead in her apartments on
West Forty-second street. The gas was
turned on. The statement was added that
Mrs. Jordan had been married twice and
that both her husbands were dead. The
following letter shows that one of them is
still alive:
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: My attention
was called to a dispatch from New York,
April 1. published in your journal on the
2d headed: "Mrs. Catherine Jordan takes
her own life." It states that both hus
bands are dead. Quite an error, as I. at
least, am very much alive.
As I am a subscriber to your Sunday
issue, I would thank you to make a proper
correction in your next Sunday's Issue as
far as that part of the article la con
cerned, and greatly oblige. Yours respect
fully J. BEROLZHIME.

Why Am I Selling the Gennine
SANDEN BELT
AT HALF PRICE?
Because I bought a cargo of them and
wish to get rid of them. Because I have
the right to sell them at as low rates as I
please or to give them away if I choose.
'They're the Dr. A. T. Sanden. patented,
and so stamped. I made no contract with
Sanden as to selling price. If I had he
would probably have bound me to get
his own high figures. But I am quite
content to clear these famous Belts at:
No. 7 $40.00 Belt for $20,00. No. 6
$30.00 Belt for $15.00. No. 5 $20.00
Belt for 910.00.
They're a good Belt. They've a
splendid record, and will cure Rheuma-
tism. Kidney Trouble and all Pains
and Nervous ailments of man and
woman.
You can have Dr. Sanden'a book
"Three Classes of Men," free, by send-
ing me your address, and if you get one
of these Belts you will live to thank me.
They're on sale at the Lion Drug Store
and at my office.

A Perfect Concentrator.
"William Patterson, a practical miner
and Inventor, gives the mining world a
concentrator constructed on new lines,
and one which Jn detail and results inter
ests any person who has gold to separate
from foreign bodies.
The principal features of this machine
are, first, the length of distributing sur
face embraced for saving the finest gold,
there being ISS feet. Inclusive of the tail
race, which has forty feet.
It is adapted for placer work and beach
mining.
It is not theoretical, but practical, and
has been In constant use on black sand
for seven years.
There are no blankets, carpets, matting
or jute sacks used. Instead the machine
employs quarter-sawed cedar boards,
which when wet will catch the finest sul
phurets. platinum and gold.
The motion of a one-inch stroke creates
a preclpitntinf? action which settles the
gold into the fibrous surface of the board.
The machine is supplied with water by a
rotary pump operated by the same power
which operates the machine. There is one
plate furnished with' the machine, which
is placed under the trip screen at the head
of the first tray. Should any .gold get
away from the fibrous surface It is caught
In the mercury trap at the lower end of
the bottom tray. The auxiliary parts con
stituting this plant consist' of. besides a
complete machine, a tall rnce lined with
boards as aforesaid; one wash box, 2x5,
in which the concentrates are saved
for future panning, and the trestles
upon which the box sets: the No. 5 double
rotary pump and a plate containing five
feet three-pound copper, plated with one
ounce silver to the foot.
Mr Patterson will explain the operation
of this cold saver to any person calling
at 227 Mission street, where It is In opera
tion dally from 11 to 4 o'clock. -.:â¢â:

FRESH IMPETUS
TO TROUBLE IS
TURF CIRCUS
California Jockey Club Not
Satisfied With Recent
Ruling.
Danny Lynch, Joe Piggott, Willie
Martin and Milt Henry Are De
nied the Privileges of
Oakland Track.
As a sort of aftermath of the recent
eruption In local turf circles, which termi
nated in the ruling against Jockey "Mike"
Hennessy and the exoneration of Jockeys
Piggott and Martin as well as Trainer
D. J. Lynch by the Western Turf Asso
ciation, the California Jockey Club decid
ed yesterday to mete out punishment to
the last named three horsemen. It was
mild, but may prove troublesome. The rul
ing says:
"Joe Piggott, Milton Henry. D. J. Lynch
and Willie Martin are denied all privileges
at Oakland track, including admission to
the grounds."
"Danny" Lynch will leave for the East
to-day. Milt Henry left here to ride the
horses of W. J. Arkell. the New York
newspaper man and horse owner. Con
necting Henry's name with the recent de
velopments was quite a surprise. Judge
Murphy said the rider was released by
Barney Schreiber owing to his dissipated
habits, and the association across the bay
considered him an unfit person to be on
its course.
Thei ruling oft of Hennessy may cause
quite a controversy between the two
Jockey clubs. F. H. Green, through Dr.
Wetherly. the press agent of Tanforan.
now denies that he said his club would
stand with the Oakland people and pro
tect Hennessy for making his confession.
Mr Green states that his answer was:
"I will inform the stewards and I am
sure they will do what is right." There
will be further correspondence between
the rival organizations regarding the
question. â¢ ' Â¦ 'Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦'' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦

ards last evening nothing was done in
the now famous "Sly case." and probably
never will be.

Agent Thomas has found that the to
bacco has been sent In overweight pack
ages to every town on the Pacific Coast,
and under authority of the Secretary of
the Treasury he has telegraphed to all
revenue officers to seize the tobacco wher
ever found. In compliance with this order
1000 pounds of the sam<Â» firm's output was
seized yesterday in Fresno and Los An

SOLD OIL STOCK TO
DEAD MEN FOR COIN
Swindler Earned Forty Dollars Per Day
With a Few Circulars and
Stamps.
JOHN BARSTOW, alias James Buck
ner, alias James B. Blair, alias Rob
ert Deuprey, is a young man of de
cided genius in his small line. With
the inside of his hat and his coat pockets
for an office and a few hundred circular
letters for capital he launched an enter
prise in oil that was bringing him in from
$25 to $40 per day in cash until yesterday,
about a month aver launching his
scheme, when he was rounded-up by
United States Marshal Shine and Post
offlce Inspector Erwin and landed In the
County Jail on a charge of using the
United States mails for fraudulent pur
poses.
The strangest part of the story is that
Barstow corresponded only with dead
men. While the money he received came
from the living, it was sent to him in the
names of and on account' of the dead. His
scheme was to consult the death notices
in the country, newspapers, and selecting
from among them the names of men over
18 years of age who had died within the
past few weeks, he sent to the address of
the deceased persons a letter and a circu
lar of which the following are samples:
The Oneida Oil Company (Incorporated), San
Francisco, Cal.. April V), ISOOâ Mr. Thomas
ProÃser, Sutter Creek. Cal.: You are hereby
notified that the final payment of $5 on certi
ficate No. 2W>. ten shares, par value $100. of the
capital stock of this company held by" you Is
now due and payable immediately to the sec
retary at the office of the company. 226 Kearny
street San Francisco. Cal. On recelrt of the
amount due the certificate of stock will be for
warded to you with receipt In full for all pay
ments, and If this payment Is not made by April
27, 1900, the stock will be held delinquent, and
by the terms of the agreement slcned by you
and now In our possession the above stock will
revert to this company and the previous pay
ments made by you will be forfeited. By order
of the board of directors.
JOHN BARSTOW, Secretary.
The Oneida Oil Company (Incorporated), cap
ital stock J250.000, John Barstow, secretary and
financial, fluent.
Kan Francisco. Cal., April 21. Thomaa Pros
ser. Sutter Creek, Cal. â Dear Sir: I Inclose
notice of final payment now due on your certl-
fliate of shares In Onelda Oil. You are cer
tainly to be congratulated on the foresight and
buslncps Judgment which led you to'lnvest with
us. as the ftock is now selling at par, or very
nearly eeven times the price at which you se
cured it ($l5). and it will ko still higher. We
are also rÂ«y ln K a regular dividend on It. Thank-
ng you for the confidence reposed In us. and
â¢ongratulatingr you once again on the suc
cess attending your Investment. I remain
espectfully yourn,
JOHN BARSTOW, Secretary.
One of these circulars was sent to the
address of a dead friend of United States
Marshal John H. Shine, and the Marshal,
having had considerable experience with
crooks, laid the matter before the post
office authorities, who detailed Inspector
J. W. Erwin on the case. Mr. Erwin
seized the contents of Barstow's postofflce
boxes In Oakland and San Francisco and
found in each letters from the friends and
relatives of dead men, containing postal
orders, bank checks and currency for $5
each. Marsha] Shine located Barstow yes
terday forenoon at the house of M C.
Thlelman, 1014 Second avenue, East Oak
land, and brought him to the office of the
Postoftlce Inspectors, I
Inspector Erwin put Barstow through
the sweating process for about an hour.
He said that his name was James Buck
ner and that he had assumed the name
of Blair for personal reasons shortly after
his arrival In this city from the East, ten
months ago. Under the name of Robert
Deuprey he had conducted what he called
the Astrological Turf Information Bureau,
at postofflce box 445. Oakland, the object
of the bureau being to furnish tips on the
races. Among the letters found In his box
Â¦waÃ one from H. Hart, 23 Kearnjr street.
San Francisco, inclosing a small sum of
money and informing Deuprey that his
tips were bad and that Hart, who repre
sented himself to be a bookmaker, had
lost J3OO by following them.
The prisoner denied that his name was
Barstow, and pretended that that was the
name of a man whom he met early in
April and who hired him as otfice boy and
messenger, to call for and open the mall
and deposit the money in bank for him.
For this service he was to be paid $10 per
week. Barstow's oflice was said to be at
226 Kearny street, but the prisoner said
that he had never been inside the office.
The discrepancies and Improbabilities In
the fellow's story were so many that Mr.
Erwin could not avoid the conclusion that
Barstow and Buckner were one and the
same and constituted the board of direct
ors of the Onelda Oil Company. A com
plaint was accordingly made against the
prisoner and a warrant of arrest was is
sued by United States Commissioner Hea
cock.
their eyes closed and pups of all ages
were dumped upon the office floor.
In desperation Mr. Holbrook seized the
telephone and called up Poundmaster
Walton and sent for the pound wagon and
all the disinfectants on hand. The pro
cession of small boys and outcast animals
continued. Cats and dogs did not har
monize, and the former were occasionally
obliged to seek the safer positions on top
of desks and bookcases.
In the midst of the turmoil the manager
of the building called and suggested that
a oranch pound be established on one of
the side streets. Late in the day the
pound wagon arrived and carted oft the
accumulation of animal life, while the
janitor made liberal use of chloride of
lime.
THE office of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, on
the fourth floor of the Parrott build
ing, looked like a compromise yes
terday between an animal show and a dog
pound. Secretary Charle3 B. Holbrook
was nearly crazy, and the lady who
manipulates the typewriter was on the
verge of hysterics.
For months past the society has been or
ganizing bands of mercy among the pupils
of the public schools. The bands now
number thousands. The members are
pledged to do everything possible to alle
viate the sufferings of the dumb animals.
A few days ago a small urchin lugged into
the society's office a mangy dog picked
up on the street. Holbrook. In an un
guarded moment, gave the youngster five
cents to encourage him in the good work.
That was the fatal mistake. The schools
wore closed yesterday, and the lad who
had received the nickel started out to earn
more money by hunting up stray dogs for
the society. Ho did not hold the monopoly
long. By 3 o'clock every boy for miles
around had the tip. and organized parties
were scouring the city for "game."
After the round-up the urchins started
for the office of the society in - bunchfs,
each carrying an armful of dog or cat. Mr.
Holbrook received the first consignment
with a smile, but the smile turned to a
ghastly expression of horror as mangy
cats, lame and starved dogs, kittens with

TWO DRUNKEN MOTHERS
TO BE SENT TO JAIL
Mrs. Bridget Haynes and Mrs. Nellie
Qualts Convicted of Cruelty
to Children.
Two young married women appeared be-
fore Judge- Mogan yesterday, each charged
with cruelty to their children. There was
a similarity in the cases in the fact that
drunkenness was responsible for their j
negrloct of their little ones and that both j
husbands had concluded to give up the j
effort to reform thHr wives.
Bridget Haynes lives at 612 Howard
street. Her husband is a 'longshoreman,
with only one leg, and he was forced to
leave her owing to her habits. About a
month ago she took the pledge before
Judge Fritz, but promptly broke it. Friday
f vening she was arrested by Policeman
Moriarity. She had be^n fighting with a
neighbor and had a black eye. When the
officer rnt^red the house a baby 10 months
old was sucking at an empty beer bottle, |
having been without food or drink for
twenty-four hours. A plrl 3 years old was
crying for something to eat.
Nellie Qualts, 354 West Mission street,
hail been arrested five times for drunken-
ness and once for cruelty to children. She
has three children, the oldest 4 years of
age. She was found drur.k Frlda'y night.
The throe children were In a terrihle con-
dition. Her husband left her last Sunday,
giving her some money for food and cloth-
Ing for the children, but she spent it all
on drink.
Both women were convicted on the
charge of cruelty to children and were or-
dered to appear for sentence to-morrow.
The Judge intimated that he would give
them the limitâ six months. The children
have been taken care of by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

as follows:
The Tax Collector may demand the exhibi
tion of any license for the current term from
any person, firm or corporation engaged or em
ployed In the transaction of any business for
which a license Is reaulred. and If such per
son, firm or corporation shall refuse or neglect
to exhibit such license the same may be revoked
forthwith by the Tax Collector.
Scott Immediately served notices on the
Board of Supervisors and the Chief of Po
lice that the club had been deprived of its
license, and his deputy, Morris Levy, will
swear out warrants for the arrest of
Groom and Gibbs for having given a box
ing entertainment at a place other than
that specified in their permit. The club's
license was granted last January by ihb
Board of Supervisors on the payment or
$1000. The subsequent peVmit for a box
ing contest specified that the same was to
be given at Woodward's Pavilion, whereas
the Neill-Murphy contest was pulled off
at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Scott says that if the National Club had
made an application for a change in the
locality where the light was to be given
they would have complied with the law
and the application would have been
granted cheerfully. No fees would have
been exacted for this application, it being
simply a formal matter.
Scott says that he did not care to stop
Friday night's fight, as such a proceeding
might have been deemed highhanded.
Scott indignantly denied Groom's accu
sation that he had made trouble for the
club because he had been refused a block
of tickets to the fight.
NATIONAL CLUB

FIGHT LICENSE
Tax Collector Scott Revokes
a Permit Granted by
Supervisors.
Tax Collector Scott yesterday revoked
the license of the National Athletic As
sociation, of which J. D. Glbbs and J. J.
Groom are the controlling spirits. Scott's
action is based on the refusal of the club's
managers to exhibit the license under
which it was presenting the Nelll-Murphy
contest Friday night. The section of the
charter under which the Tax Collector
claims the right to revoke the licenses is
MY GYPSY COMES
HOME IN FRONT
OF ROSORMONDE
Sprightly Bit of Horseflesh
Also Lowers a Coast
Record.
The miniature racing marvel My Gypsy
is now a coast record holder. Beaten last
Wednesday over one mile and a quarter
at Oakland in 2:06, the filly evened up
matters yesterday by lowering the colors
of Rosormonde over the same route, and
lowered the coa.st record to 2:05? i as well.
Gypsy, with S7 pounds and J. Ranch in
the saddle, ruled a strong favorite and
was never headed. Rosormonde found the
Journey a trifle far, but made a gallant
bid. being beaten but a couple of lengths.
The Fretter and Constellator were never
contenders, the showing made by the pair
causing considerable comment.
The attendance was large and the bet
ting entirely satisfactory to the book
makers, who as a rule "kick" on the
slightest provocation. Four favorites had
their numbers displayed as winners.
The 8 to 5 favorite Coming Event took
the introductory number very handily from
Flush of Gold and Lobosina, two out
siders. Mrs. C. a well backed one from
Johnny Campbell's stable, showed plenty
of hi Â«. .Â»; for three furlongs, when she died
away.
Rollick, the best of the Burns & Water
house two-year-olds, won the kindergar
ten number without much effort, starting
a 2to T> favorite. Grafter held Phil Archi
bald safe, securing the place.
There was a steady play on Novia at
odds of 11 to 5 to win the six furlong
event, third to be decided, with quite as
much coin going into the books on De
Ulaise. After racing in front to the
stretch Novia died away. Sumrt, on Do
Blaise, then came through, beating out
the 12 to 1 shot Merry Boy a heart. Pat
Morrispey never showed any speed.
It was considered peaches and cream for
Headwater in the seven furlong jaunt.
Hughey Jones' fast sprinter closed a 7 to
10 chance, and at one stage of the run
ning it looked as if the 40 to 1 shot Tizona
would land. Ranch sat down hard on the
favorite, ilnally pulled the race out of the
coals by half a length. The others ran
badly, far below par.
Backed from 15 to 6 Snips, with Mounce
again in the cab. rattled into the depot a
neck before Twinkler. Silver Tone was
flagged at the start or he would have won.
<=i}=3IBURN Cove presented a gay sight
yesterday afternoon on the occasion
II of the opening of the season of the
Corinthian Yacht Club. In front of
the clubhouse the entire fleet lay
at its moorings, brightly decorated
with fluttering signal and prize flags.
Not quite all the yachts are in com
mission yet, but it will not be long be-
I fore the whole fleet is ready to get under
I way. During the afternoon the clubhouse
was crowded with ladies and members,
the former in bright dresses and Easter
hats and the latter in natty yachting cos
tume. Dancing, music and song made the
hours pass pleasantly. The ladies re
turned to the city by the 5:40 boat. The
yachtsmen donned old sailing togs and
eagerly awaited the signal to attack the
clam chowder and other good things pro
vided by Port Captain John H. Keefe.
The 6:30 boat from San Francisco brought
a few more yachtsmen to swell the al
ready largo crowd. About 8:30 the mem

SAN JOSE, April 2S.â TT)Â« closing and
deciding game of the series between Stan
ford and Berkeley was played at Cyclers'
Park to-day before 1500 people and was
easily won by Berkeley by a score of 10
to 5. Stanford came down In a special
train with an army of enthusiastic root
ers and lost mainly on account of the
ragged work of Pitcher Lannlgan. It was
one of his blue days and he did not seem
to know what he was there for. He let
nine men take bases on balls and gener
ally handled the stick as though he did
not know what it was made for. Other
wise the game was well played and some
fine work was done by both sides. The

SENATORS WIN
IN EASY STYLE
FROM OAKLAND
The Sacramentans Find and
Badly Punish Steffani's
Curves.
Listless and Careless Game In Which
the Result Was Never in
Doubt at Any
Tim*.
Sacramento 8, Oakland 3.
Michael Steffanl. dude and Greek
scholar, was untwisted, unraveled and hit
all over the grounds yesterday afternoon
by the heavy stlckmen of Sacramento.
With Oakland's costly errors thrown In
the capital city team was permitted to
push men over the rubber at all times.
The game lacked interest on account of
Its one-sided nature. The Senators start
ed out on the Jump to keep the boy at
the Scoreboard busy. Oakland did not
P, as Â» a man over the plate until tire
eighth.
At the very outset of the gramÂ© after
.McLaugnlin s out Devereaux took a con
stitutional, finishing his course around thÂ©
sacks on Eagan's single to right, which
Dunleavy allowed to roll through his
hands. Two fouls Into Hammond's hands
ended the inning. In the second Shana
han, who went to first on a single, scored
on Stultz's two-bagger.
The third brought a couple of runs to
the Senators. Eagan and Stanley stepping
over the rubber by reason of hits ana
rare Juggling. Then for two Innings the
Senators rested. In the sixth there was
some lively stick work. Hanlon connected
for two bases, scoring when Stultz rolled
the ball to deep center for three bags,
subsequently scoring on Doyle's single.
McLaughlin also scored before the Inning
was over. Stanley added run eight to Sac
ramento's column In the seventh.
Dunleavy opened the end of the seventh
with a long drive to the roofs back of
center. Luck was against him. for tha
ball boundÂ«d back Into tha grounds and
his bag chasing ended at third.
Oakland's run in the eighth went to
Schmeer's credit. He was safe at the
first station on Eagan's bad throw and
made second on Hammond's hit, going to
third on an error of Stultz and scoring on
Franck's out.
In the ninth Oakland saw a gleam or
hope. Dunleavy and Moskman walked,
but Lange and Hardle died In rapid suc
cession. Schmeer hit for a double and
Dunleavy scored. Hammond hit to short
and Mosklman scored, but Schmeer was
dropped at the plate. The score:

but the Fraud
Does Not Stop.
each case to Adams' authentic records In
making up the figures given here.
Adams is the Southern Pacific and
Wells, Fargo & Co. agent at Colma, and ia
also Postmaster. He acted In a very pe
culiar manner when asked to produce the
Colma records and would not do so until
ordered by the Coroner. He at first flatly
denied having any records. When asked
why he did not make a report of the glar
ing discrepancies in the matter under In
vestigation he said he had "had his eye
on the proposition."
When asked if it was likely tho Chinese
â¢were burying more than one set of bones
under, one transfer he said he did not
think so, but promised to open the next
box brought out.
Investigation shows startling discrepan
cies between the records, of permits given
here and transfers issued at Colma.
These* records demonstrate that a very
small percentage indeed of the "fish
bones" are reinterred. During ' the last
sixteen months, for instance, at Colma
about 760 Chinese burial transfers .were
obtained, while 1737 removal permits md
657 original burial permits were obtained
in San Francisco, a total of Â£394, leaving
1634 bodies yet to be accounted for. Dur
ing the month of December last, 718
Chinese removal permits were obtained
here, while the records at Colma show a
total of ojly fifty-seven transfers for that
month.
During January 43S removal permits
were issued here and not one removal
transfer at Colma. During March twen
ty removal transfers were issued to sev
enty-eight permits given, and this month
there have been issued 200 removal per
mits at the San Francisco office, against
thirty-eix transfers at Colma.
During January and February last
there were 112 original burial permits is
sued here and fifty-six were Issued by
Adams. How many Whalen rave out Is
not known, but he could hardly have
made tae totals balance. Nearly every
other month shows a difference that could
not be accounted for by Whalen's trans
fers.
"We wrote to the Coroner of San Ma
teo about this matter when it was first
called to our attention," said President
Williamson of the Health Board yester
day, "but for some reason he did not
deign to reply. We cannot follow every
wagon that leaves here with Chinese
bones into San Mateo County."
The reason so many bodies were
"rushed" out of the old cemetery just
before the charter went into effect that
is that the disinterment inspector re
ceived $2 50 for each body removed un
der the old law.

FRAUD In the matter of shipping
the remains of Chinese to the
flowery kingdom is at present the
subject of Investigation by the lo
cal Health Department and the
police, whose aid has been enllÃted by
Health Officer O'Brien. The board has
finally become awakened to the fact that
the city has been defrauded of thousands
of dollars Justly due it and Is still being
victimized by the wily Mongolians.
The investigation was commenced sev
eral days ago. Health Officer O'Brien de
taling department employes and also
placing the matter into the hands of the
Chief of Police. It is the sacred belief of
every Chinese that his remains should
finally re?t in Chinese soil, and the bones
of dead wanderers from Cathay are ship
ped to their home country from all parts
of the world. In California there is an
"export duty" on these ghastly Mongo
lian relics. The sum of $10 is demanded
by the city for each full set of bones
shipped, a State statute providing that
this amount be paid for each permit to
phlp the remains of a human being out
of the State.
The health authorities suspect that most
of tha great number of bodies disinterred
from the old City Cemetery on Point Lo
bos road ostensibly to be reburied in the
Chinese graveyards In San Mateo County
were really sent to China and without
payment of the $10 fee demanded for each
ekeleton.
Further than this it Is prohable that the
bones of many Chinese who now die in
this city and for whose burial In San
Mateo County permits are obtained are
really shipped to China, instead of being
taken across the county line for burial
The flesh is removed from the frames of
the dead Celestials by boiling, or some
other process. It is thought, and the skele
tons sent back across the sea as "fish
bones." under which name the Chinese
ship the last relics of their dead fellow
countrymen.
That white men are helping the Chinese
in carrying- on this fraud is probable. Si
lence is the chief commodity the Cau
casian abettors would have to sell fn this
affair, and the Mongolians could afford to
pay a pood price. A demand for an in
vestigation made at the proper time would
have probably resulted in the entire stop
ping of the illegitimate practice, as it will
purely be stopped now if the If^cal Health
Department sees fit to do its duty and pre-

An Interesting Letter From Cape
Nome.
T. C. Crawford, who left here about two
years ago for Dawson, writes from his
camp, about 100 miles east of Nome, of
the wonderful richness of the country.
The letter was received by G. W. Price,
manager of the Krogh Manufacturing
Company, 9 Stevenson street. Mr. Craw
ford writes he has found dirt running $40
to the pan, but the average is $2. He has a
No. 4 Krogh pump and a twelve-horse en
gine and boiler, which machinery, he says
he could rent for $1000 a day. He enters
with detail Into the best methods of hand-
Ming; this sand, which he has discovered
by personal experience. He advises a
man to bring all the comforts possible,
including his family. A person going to
Nome would do well to call on Mr. Price
''and read this letter, as Mr. Crawford's
experiences are very Interesting.

and yet he wan good to me. I managed to
ccrape alone, but it was a dreadful struggle,
and never a night did I sleep until I saw him
*afely In bed. Hp rarely came home till near
daylight, and how he ever stood It all these year*
I dr.n"t know. What cured him waa a remedy
called Golden Fr>ecinc, a powder to be mixed
with coffee or fqod or anything liquid. I gave
It to him secretly. I saw an article in gone
newspaper about this remedy, and It seemed to
be Just the thing. I thought of it day and night
for quite a while and then concluded to try It,
come what might. You know the rest of the
story. It was only a few days when he said:
'Mother, I have resolved to stop drinking.' He
put his arm around me. kissed me passionately
and with tears rolling down his cheeks begged
me to forgive him for all the misery he had
caused me. And he did stop. That remedy had
done its work, and if there ever was a message
straight from heaven it was that article In the
newspaper which told me to uee Golden Spe-
cific" This remedy Is the discovery of Dr. J.
W. Haines. ISS6 Glenn building. Cincinnati,
Ohio and he sends to every woman who writes
him a free, trial package of Golden Specific, so
she can try It for husband, eon or brother, and
thus save him from a life that must eventually
prove his complete ruin. Do not fail to write
at once for this free trial package.

GLEN PARK will open to-day for the
summer season and a lively bill of
entertainment, will be offered. More
than twenty separate vaudeville
features will be presented at the theater,
the most novel and sensational of which is
the turn of Oura's royal Japanese troupe
of gymnasts. These athletes, of whom
there" are 6even, do some remarkable feats
on the slack wire. This is not the only
high class number on the card, as the pro
gramme will attest.
Out of doors the park will present many
new attractions. A balloon ascension, a
slide for life and other hair-raising blood-
Btlrring events will be in order. A dacing
cyclist who rides his wheel down a ladder
160 feet lons from an elevation of 100 feet
will be a feature of the open-air enter
tainment. Besides all this a band of four
teen pieces will provide music during the
entire show.
The brightness of its attractions is what
has caused Glen Park to become such a
popular resort. There is always some
thing startling and novel to be seen there
and the sunshine that floods the park adds
to the pleasure.
The new management announces that It
Intends to make this one of the most
popular of the many pleasure resorts In
the vicinity of Ban Francisco. It Is ex
pected that the opening day will furnish
ample proof of the claims of the manage
ment In this respect.

The biggest frauds prepetrated took place
of course in the removal of the bodies
from the old City Cemetery, which began
last August and Is still going on, though
of the 2000 or more bodies Interred there
but few are yet to be removed.
No charge Is made here ; under the char
ter for removal permits, but in San Mateo
County 50 cents Is charged for a burial
transfer. Half of this goes Into the pocket
of the Deputy Coroner making the collec
tion and the balance into that of Coroner
Crowe of San Mated County. These trans
fers are issued on the burial or removal
permits given by the local Health Office
C. J. Adams is the Deputy Coroner at
Colma who Issues the transfers for the
larger Chinese cemetery. A Deputy Cor
one,r Is appointed for every cemetery in
Colma. M. Whalen Is the deputy who is
sues transfers for the smaller cemetery.
He could' not be found yesterday, but
Adams said he averaged ten transfers a
month, and this number was added In

vent the shipment of any more "flah"
bones until the tax has been paid.
During the last few months but a half
dozen permits to ship human remains to
China have been bought at the health of
fice, and for the came period many cases
of fish bones have been going to that
country aboard the Pacific Mail steam
ers. Alexander Center, manager of the
steamship company. Is authority for the
latter statement. Mr. Center would not
divulge the names of the shippers, but
they are supposed to be Chinese firms of
undertakers or their representatives.
Further burying in the City Cemetery
was prohibited more than two years ago,
and In March, IS9S, live of the Chinese
companies bought five acres of land In
"Happy Valley," close to Colma, for a
graveyard, and In the same month the
King wung Benevolent Socletj' bought a
small tract near by. Since that time nil
burials of Chinese dying in this city have
taken place in those cemeteries.

THE HEALTH HABIT.
Just aa Easy to Form as Any Other.
We do not deliberately form our pet
habits, but they are unconsciously ac-
quired and prow as we grow, and by the
time we learn they are hurting us, we
find them too strong to be easily broken.
Then, why not form a good habit, a
habit which will counteract the many bad
ones, in other words contract the unfash-
ionable habit of being always well.
The best health habit to get Into Is to
h:{Je> ar.d kocp a vigorous stomach; if you
have a healthy digestion you can drink
your bclovod coffee, smoke your favorite
brand of tobacco, with little or no harm;
the mischief begins when these things are
forced upon the faithful stomach, without
any assistance.
Forn) the habit of taking after meals
some harmless but efficient <Jlg>"!tive
Â¦which will relieve the etomach of so much
extra work.
Mature furnishes us with tuch digestives
and when they are combined in such a
pleasant preparation as Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets, they give the overworked
etomai-h just the necessary assistance to
secure perfect digestion without any of
thtr harruful effects of cathartics and sim-
ilar drugs*.
1 he habit of taklnjr Ptuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets after meals Is as necessary to the
Tveak stomach as food itself, and Indeed
to pet the benefit from food eaten, noth-
ing better and certainly nothing safer can
be used.
Many families consider Stuart's Tablets
ot essential in tho house as knives ar.d
1( tks.
They consist entirely of natural dipest-
Jvc principles without the effect or char-
acterietict of drups; they have no cathar-
tic action, but simply go to work on the
food tat en and ofgest It.
Take into ax-count your bad habits and
the txptir.se they entail and then invest
fifty cents in a box of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and see if your digestion fur the
Dext month Is not vastly improved.
Afk the clerk in any drug store the
name of the most successful and popular
f=t"mach remedy and he will say "Stu-
art's."

The most common of the multitude ot diseases that afflict humanity are
disorders of digestion, and these are of the most far-reaching in their ef-
fects on the general health. Owing to their Immediate nervous association,
the brain at once enters into sympathy with the stomach whenever the func-
tions of the latter are disturbed. So intimately, in fact, are the stomach and
head connected through the medium of the great sympathetic system, that
mental disturbances will not only produce loss of appetite, but also affect the
process of digestion; while this In turn produces depressslon of spirits and
sometimes Insanity!
CAUSES-
â¢ Most persona are familiar from personal exoerience with the commoner cause of
dyspepsiaâ exceatea in eating and drinking; the excessive use of alcoholic llquors a which
Inflame the coating of the stomach. A disordered condition of the blood renders the
stomach more susceptible to attacks ot Inflammation and Irritation.
SYMPTOMS.
Palpitation of the heart, a trembling In the pit of the Btomach, loss of flesh, restless-
ness, depression of eplrtts. mental and physical weakness, a weak and flabby condition
of the muscles, a dry and hot, burning skin. locs of appetite, acidity of tha stomach,
heartburn, vomiting, flatulence, etc
CI6CII OZOUfi CUBE DYSPEPSIA.
There Is nothing .that equals ELECTROZONE for the removal of this
distressing trouble. "ELECTROZONE is a combination of the very elements
of life. It acts directly on the trouble and removes all impurities from the
blood, causing a healthy flow to all parts of the body, which assists the

THE SHIPMENT CF "FISH BONES" TO CHINA BECOMES AN
IMPORTANT LOCAL INDUSTRY.
21land was killed by falling from the third
floor.- Pinneo has been living in Dimond,
Alameda County. , He was formerly em
ployed as a cracker baker In Denver. His
age was about 45 years.
Dr.: George c. Pinneo of Diamond City,
father of the dead : man, arrived in the
city yesterday afternoon. Pinneo was aub
lect to eDlleotic fits."
GEORGE PINNEO fell through an
elevator shaft in the works of the
Standard Biscuit Company, <â¢ at
Front and Pacific streets,, yester
day. He died soon after from the injuries
received. The story given out at the works
was that Pinneo had a fit while he stood .
on the elevator and was about to descend.
He fell backward and his head struck
heavily on the floor of the elevator, which
was at that time about a foot below the
level of the third floor, and stationary.
Several employes, seeing Plnneo's mishap,
ran to raise the elevator to the le.vel of
the floor. Some one pulled on the elevator
rope that caused It to descend. The in
tention was undoubtedly to have the ele
vator rise, but in the confusion the oppo
site direction was given. As the elevator
dropped Pinnoo, who had been tossing
about in his fit, no longer held in, fell
three stories to the cement* basement.
Pinneo was picked up unconscious and
carried to the Receiving Hospital, and
there he died. The Coroner will investi
gate. This is the second elevator accident
that has taken place In the biscuit com
pany's works this year. Bernlce McClel-

HIBERNIANS ENJOY A
PLEASANT REUNION
There was a reunion of all the local di
visions of the Ancient Order of Hiber
nians in Teutonia Hall last night to. enjoy
a smoker. Frank Conklfti, the master of
ceremonies, welcomed all to the feast,
after which he called on a number of
members prominent in the order to make
addresses and on others for songs, recita
tions and specialties. The speakers were
J. J. Donohue. county president; Judge M.
Cooney. for Division No. 2; J. J. Moran,
No. S; John Coughlan.No. 10; J. P. Devine,
No. 12; John P. Henry, No. 14; M. Dunne,
No. 17. and John O'Neil. for No. 20. Those
who furnished the musical and literary
portion of the programme were: C. B.
Flannagan, T. w. Hlckey, John Heenan,
Charles A. Swrlgert, George Lowe, Mar
low. Kelly and Hansen, M. A. McEvoy, H.
M. Cullcnden, Perrin and Desier and Peter
Greenan. The entertainment closed with
the singing of "God Save Ireland." by
Eugene D. Sullivan, the five hundred in
the audience joining In the chorus.
During the evening genuine T. D. pipes
were passed around for all who wished to
enjoy a smoke. There was also a collation
and refreshments.
C and D, who each put In $10,000 for their
stock, making $40,000 paid-in capital, which
pays each man 12H per cent dividends on the
same business. Now, as a corporation shall
we tax only the $10,000 of merchandise? If so.
$30,000 (the money of B, C and D) has bren
wiped out of existence as property for tax
ation. This would be contrary to law and Jus
tice. Under our laws governing taxation we
should tax the corporation for a franchise of
$30,000, then the capital or money of B. C and
D Js taxed, and they pay the taxes through
receiving a smaller dividend. 11 Instead of 12/2
per cent. Is any one injured by this?
The Assessors have It in their power in this
war to modify somewhat the evils of excessive
capitalization, and to control to some extent
the ever growing trusts, and exact from them
some adequate tribute.
It Is along these lines that I shall endeavor
during the next few years to equalize taxation.
Until personal property of all classes Is more
Justly assessed, I shall endeavor not to add
anything to the burden of taxation which real
estate Is now bearing.
"WASHINGTON DODGE.
necessity of contributing its quota to the ex
penses of running our government.
This Is well illustrated in the case of a cer
tain millionaire, who, owning no real estate,
is the possessor of personal property to al
most a million dollars. His taxable property,
revealed after an examination under oath, was
last year only $10,000. This amount he had In
vested in bonds, which were then taxed for
the first time. This year, making no return
to the Assessor, he explained, on being sub
poenaed to testify, that It did not pay him to
be taxed on bonds, so he had sold them since
lai=t year and invented the proceeds In the
stock of the Alaska Packers' Association,
which, he Faid triumphantly, "you know you
cannot tax; It is a California corporation." So
he exi>ects to draw his dividends -while his
money, <>r the property representing it, goes
practically untaxed. His wealth is practlcally
a!l invested In United States bonds, which are
exempt from taxation, and Ftock of California
corporations. There is but one way to reach
him, namely, tax the franchise to the corpora
tion, and the tax thereon will fall on him and
com* out of the dividends paid on his stock.
Now, I propose to reach the capital of this
class as far as possible and let It bear its
share of taxation. There are many corpora
tions similar to the one Instanced which should
be taxed tnr franchises for the same reasons.
Thus the California Fruit Packers' Associa
tion has stock having a paid-up value of $2.
773.500, on which regular dividends are paid.
Its total aeseFsed valuation in this State In
all counties where It pays taxes is $355,544;
this would leave Its franchise worth $1,309,756
If we aFsfRS It for only 63 per cent of Its paid
up capital. This assessment will be made.
The California Powder Company has stock
of an actual paid-up value of $1,500,000, having
a market value of $2,250,000. It pays taxes in
all the counties of the State where It Is as
sessed on a valuation of $554, 594. Its franchise,
therefore, is assessed low at a valuation of
$695,100. We must either do this or allow the
millions of money actually invested In this
enterprise, and which are earning a greater
Interest than most Improved real estate earns,
go practically untaxed. This our revenue lews
never contemplated, and. therefore, I shall
assess its franchise as Indicated.
One more example. The Pacific Borax Com
pany has a paid up capital of . $1,900,000, its
market value is $2.550.000. Its total assessment
in California Is $211, 454, in Nevada and Oregon
$19,570. For thin, it being without, the State,
it Is entitled, according to our laws to no
deduction. This makes a total of $231,054 as
sessed valuation. Assessing its stock then at
60 per cent of its market value, we must value
its franchise at $1,478,948.
These are a few only of the many great cor
porations vrhich have In the past escaped a
proper and reasonable assessment.
I Let it not be thought that because they are
taxed for a "franchise" that they Rre regarded
as having an "exclusive right" or that the
franchise In Itself is valuable. It is taxed be
cause under our revenue laws It Is property.
; represented by the capital stock, which would
otherwise escape taxation were the franchise
to remain untaxed, for, under the California
laws, we can only assess the tangible property
at its actual cash value. The same object is
attained In some other States through the law
permitting the tangible property to be assessed
fur in excess of its intrinsic value. Thus Ohio
permits the Assessor to value a telephone box
at a value of $200, though Its cost Is but $5,
on the ground of Its earning capacity. Our
law does not permit this as stated, but attains
the Fame end by assessing the franchise as In
dicated, and the Supreme Court has clearly In
dicated that the full cash value of a franchise
Is obtained when from the market value of
the capital stock we deduct the value of the
tangible property cf the corporation. When
this Is done, the capital stock of the corpora
tion Is practically assessed. If it Is not done,
the capital stock, or the money Invested In it,
escapes to a great extent from taxation.
We assess franchises, therefore. In order that
the corporation may be compelled to pay taxes
on an amount bearing: some relation to the
market value of its capital stock. This is recog
nized as Just by law, and in most States is
made imperative by levying an assessment on
the capital stock direct. This Is clearly Just
and reasonable, and may be made clear by
this Illustration. A has a business in which he
has Invested $10,000 capital In merchandise. It
is a very profitable business and nets him $5000
a year for 50 per cent) profits, but he Is only
taxed for the $10,000 which he has Invested.
Seelnp a chance to capltalli* his profitable

THE army of school teachers of San
Francisco is still hard at work on
the preparations for their great cel
ebration and festival to be held
Tuesday next, Mayday, at Glen Park.
If success brings happiness, and it will in
this case, there will be a joyful band of
teachers at the resort named on this
memorable day, for it seems as if half the
people of San P'rancisco were going to at
tend this festival. Of course, that num
ber will not attend it, but there will be
one of the largest crowds ever seen at a
resort contiguous to the city. There is
more talk about the Teachers' â¢Annuity
Society benefit than any other local event
just at present.
How those teachers have worked, too!
Not a detail has been overlooked, and cer
tainly thore are enough details in the ar
rangements for such a tremendous cele
bration. There are so many things to be
looked after that no one can be i<ile who
has anyihlng to do with the arrange
ments. How well the committees have
done the work will be demonstrated by
the success of the celebration, and that
eucceps is well assured. Those who attend
will go away wondering that so many fea
tures could be crowded into one gala day.
The children are working, too, and with
a will. Every day there are rehearsals,
and the pupils will be perfect in the parts
and drills they are to take part in when
Tuesday comes.

Captain Hart of the Warren
Too Sick to Take His
Vessel Out.
Many Changes of Officers in the
Transport Service â More Ves
sels on the Way Here From
New York.
t
The United States army transport War
ren will sail for Manila on Mayday. The
cargo is now being rushed aboard and
Captain Dunn expects to have everything
in the shape of supplies and quartermas
ter's stores in the vessel on Monday morn
ing.
The Warren will take away the largest
consignment of troops that has left here
in months. Many officers whose sick
leaves have expired are going back on her,
a lot of men for the hospital corps and
about 600 recruits will about take up all
the passenger accommodation the good
ship possesses. A stop will be made at
Honolulu and the men given a run ashore,
as the plague scare is now over. From
there the transport will go direct to Ma
nila. Â»
Among the cabin passengers who will
sail on the Warren will be Major Charles
L.. Heizman surgeon, IJ. S. A.; Major Kd
win F. Gardner, surgeon, U. S. A.; Major
F. J. Combe, surgeon, U. S. V.; First
Lieutenant G. A. Skinner, assistant sur
geon U. S. A.; First Lieutenant Benjamin
J. Edgaj\ assistant surgeon, U. S. A.; act
ing Assistant Surgeons Frank R. Maura
and Albert L. Millen; First Lieutenant
Carl R. Darnall, assistant surgeon, U. S.
A., and acting Assistant Surgeon Randall
C. Stoney. Seventy-five hospital corps
men will make up the medical force.
The Warren will go out with almost a
new set of officers. Captain Hart is on
the sick list and will remain ashore for a
few weeks. When chief officer of the Mar
iposa he was thrown off the bridge and
had several of his ribs broken. This was
while the mail steamer was on her way
to Australia. When Sydney, N. S. \V.,
was reached Captain Hurt was sent to a
hospital. His wife was at that time one
of the visitors to the hospital and in that
way she and her husband became ac
quainted. After the Mariposa completed
another round trip the jovial master mari
ner became a benedict and brought his
wife to San Francisco. When the Gov
ernment purchased the Scandla and re
named her the AVarren Hart was made
captain.
AVhen the Warren reached San Francis
co on her last trip Captain Hart was not
a well man, but he held out aa long as
possible, but finally had to go to St.
Luke's Hospital. There it was found that
the ribs broken on the Mariposa in a gale
were causing all the trouble. An operation
had to be performed and a growth on the
bones scraped off. The captain has been
out and about since, but gathers strength
slowly. He will take command of the
transport Sheridan and Captain Pierce of
that vessel will go out as master of the
Warren. The Sheridan will be in port for
a couple of months.
Chief Officer Fred E. Magune of the
Warren is now master of the Lawton.
The second and third officers of the War
ren have taken a step upward in conse
quence. Purser Bucklln left the Warren
yesterday and is now purser of the Nome
steamer C. D. Lane (Irrawaddy). His
place has been taken by R. Center, for
merly Quartermaster Miles' clerk. The
Warren's freight clerk has gone to the.
Lawton as purser. A number of other
changes makes almost a new crew list
for the Warren.
The cabin passengers of the transport
Sherman were landed yesterday. The sol
diers and sick will be put ashore at the
Presidio this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
The battalion of the Fourteenth
Infantry that is aboard contains a great
number of California boys. They are to
be given a welcome home. A tug carrying
a band and a number of prominent Na
tive Sons will go to the transport as soon
as she Is released from quarantine and
will convoy her to the Presidio. Patriotic
airs will be played and the boys will be
given a royal welcome. WTien they land
on Presidio wharf a cavalry escort will
meet them and accompany them to their
quarters.
The transport fleet is to be increased by
three fine vessels. The Kllpatrick, Buford
and Macpherson are now on their way to
Manila via Suez. They will come here
from the Philippines to be fitted out and
will run regularly between San Francisco
and Manila. The tug Slocum is also on
her way here from New York via Suez.
On her arrival she will replace the char
tered tug Fearless.

ASSESSMENT OF
FRANCHISES TO
RAISE REVENUE
First Tax Roll Under the
New Charter of the
City.
Alaska Packers' Association and
Other Rich Corporations Receive
Uotice of an Increase in
Valuation.
Taxpayers are manifesting much inter
est in the tax roll for the coming year,
the first under the new charter. There
are apprehensions that the new govern
ment will be more expensive than the old
an<J fears are expressed tha.t the burden
of increase will fall on real estate.
In this connection Assessor Washington
Dodge makes the following statement
over his own signature:
If it become* necessary to increase the tax
roll over iZTo.OOO.OOO, the amount on which this
year's revenue was collected, real estate thail
not be made to bear the extra burden. I
fhall continue my efforts to make personal
property bÂ«ar more of the burden of taxation.
This I hopÂ« to do by assessing property of
this class which has heretofore escaped taxa
tion- Heal estate will only be raised, if at all.
Ir> those lew localities where it may be foun-1
to I** assessed below the uniform basiÂ£ of
valuation prevailing in other j.arts of the city.
The greatest gains this year, Â«ts >vÂ«i the ca*e
last year, are expected to be made in the as-
ECEsnient of franchises.
I.*Et year. It will be remembered, J15.000,000
was added to the asseÂ«Â£ment of franchises of
the quasi public corporation?. The law. how
ever, makes no distinction between the method
<:t asbtsKing the franchise of a quasi public
corporation and that of any other corporation.
It becomes necessary under the peculiar tax
system cf this State to tax franchisee gen
erally, or millions of p^rs^nal property would
escape taxation. This condition arises from
the statutory exemption of the stock of Cali
fornia corporations irom assessment. The mar
ket value of the stock represents the value of
the property of the corporation, tangible and
intangible, end this stock itself is taxed, in
m<*t States, at its par or at its market value.
The constitution of our State says all stock
?hall be assessed; but the Supreme Court in
ex^mptinp -specifically the stock of California
corporaxtMH said that the property of the cor
poration, "Including its franchise," being fu!!y
taxed, to then tax the stock, which represents
this, would t>e double taxation, and hence un
constitutional. But exempting the stock from
taxation we must clearly tax the tangible prop
erty of the corporation and Its franchise at
such a figure as would represent the value of
its stock or a lair proportion of the same. If
Â»c do not we haye â worse than double taxa
tion â no taxation at all practically.

words, it p&jm tsxes on about one twenty-sixth
pÂ«1 of the actual amount of money invested in
the enterprise, and on lee* than one fortieth r,f

it v.<*re not rr> Invested it would probably pay
taxes throuEii beirp Invented in some other

How. then, shall we tax it? Under our law, 1n
nnly one way. By assessing its franchise for
the difference between the value of its stork and
thÂ» value of the tans'Me prcperty on which tt

REV. V. MARSHALL LAW DIES
OF PARALYSIS IN A TEXAS TOWN
REV. V. MARSHALL, LAW. former
rector of an Episcopal church of
Oakland, died in Clarendon, Tex.,
yesterday.
Rev. Victor Marshall Law was called to
Clarendon, Tex., by the Bl3hop of that
diocese and started on his work a few
weeks ago. His family left the home in
Oakland to remain In San Francisco until
arrangements were made to join the head
of the family at Clarendon.
On April 20 Mrs. Law received a tele
gram stating that her husband had been
stricken with paralysis, and on the fol
lowing Sunday left for his bedside.
During the week daily telegrams in
formed the family of the patient's condi
tion. Each day the news was more en
couraging, until on Friday, when a change
for the worse was noted. Early yester
day morning Mrs. Law telegraphed to
her relatives the news of her husband's
death. Mr. Law was stricken with pa
ralysis about eighteen months ago, but
the stroke was of short duration, and
atter his arrival in Clarendon he wrote
that he had entirely recovered.
Deceased was a graduate of Cornell
College and also of the Hahnemann Medi
cal College of Chicago. Mrs. Law was
at her husband's bedside when he passed
away, having arrived in Clarendon two
days before his death. She immediately
left for San Francisco with the body and
will arrive here on Tuesday.
OAKLAND, April 28.â Rev. V. Marshall
Law was appointed rector of the Church
of the Advent about five years ago, first
attracting attention by the introduction
in his church of an automatic cleansing
communion chalice, taking the place of
the - individual communion cup. Later
some friction arose between the rector
and his vestry over his sermons on Chris
tian science. John J. Valentine, the pres
ident of Wells, Fargo & Co., senior war
den of the vestry and one of the largest
contributors to the church, resigned. The
vestry maintained that the financial trou
bles of their rector had much to do with
the misunderstandings which arose. Once
the Sabbath collection was attached by
a Deputy Constable for a Chinese laundry
bill owed by the rector. Several months
ago matters came to a head. The con
gregation dwindled and the large, vested
choir went on a strike. The rector was
given a vacation last October, at the end
of which he resigned. Dr. Law was also
a practitioner of medicine. He had been
In China as a missionary before he came
to Oakland.
IS LAID AWAY TO
HIS ETERNAL REST
Friends Follow the Bemains of An
drew Smith Halladie to the
Grave.
The funeral of the late Andrew Smith
Halladie was held yesterday from the
First Unitarian Church. Rev. Dr. Steb
bins, assisted by Rev. Bradford Leavttt,
presided at the impressive services. The
church waa filled with the many friends
of the family of the deceased. The di
rectors of the Mechanics' Institute, the
regents and facility of the University of
California, the trustees of the First Uni
tarian Church and the employes of the
California Wire Works, of which de
ceased was president, attended in a body
to pay their last respects to the man who
had passed away.
Dr. Stebbins briefly sketched the life of
the inventor, telling of his early strug
gles and ultimate triumph. He dwelt
upon his many noble gifts and called at
tention to the many worthy qualities that
made him a stanch, true and loving
friend. In conclusion Dr. Stebbins said:
Let mÂ» not apeak of him now in fulsome
praise, of loose and tawdry eulogy. Let mÂ»
not Indulge in vajrue phrase of rhetoric or
fancy, but among all men whom I "have met.
and I have met many. I know as much of men
as they are, as is common to human experi
ence; I know more of men and their manner*
and their character than ministers are com
monly supposed to know: and when I speak of
him I speak of his great humaneness, his
kindness. I never saw where the vaÂ«t sea of
his generosity washed against the shore of self
interest. For those who were dependent upcrn
him in any way. for those In whose blood
flowed a kindred strain, he was surpassingly
good. All he had was for them, all he could
do v* 3 for them, and he left a host of silent
friends who will never say a word, who will
never utter a word of his KOortness, hut in
whose hearts that kindness Iras fallen like the
gentle showers upon the thirsty earth.
Hail, faithful friend. Hail, honorable man.
Ascend to your father and to my father, to
your God ar.d to my God.

WEBSTER IS ACCUSED OF
BREACH OF CONFIDENCE
School Director Denman Says Super
intendent Informed Principal
Kilpatrick of His Threat
ened Suspension.
School Director Denman Is authority
for the statement that Superintendent
Webster has violated the confidence of
the Board of Education In having notified
Principal Kilpatrick of the Business
Evening School some weeks ago of the
board's contemplated action to suspend
him. Denman says that Kllpatrick's
wife Informed both him and his associate
on the school board, Mrs. Kincald, that
Webster had notified Kllpatrlck'a attor
neys that the accused principal was about
to be suspended, and had suggested the
immediate issuance of a restraining or
der to prevent such action. As a con
sequence Denman says that the board
was served with the injunction a few
minutes before the suspension waa to
have been made.
Superintendent Webster, when seen
last night, denied that he had violated
the confidence of the board In any par
ticular. He says that action was taken
at one of the secret conferences of the
board, and that, meeting Kilpatrick. he
felt It his duty to inform him that he
was In danger of being suspended. "Web
ster is of the opinion that the dark lan

until the final disposition of his case,

General Feeling of Elation Over the
Election of Speaker Alden An
derson to the Presidency
cf State LeagTie.
The ejection of Fpc-aker Alden Anderson
to the presi6< nry of the State League of
Republican Cluba gives general satisfac
tion in Sa.n Francisco. In the prolonged
Senatorial conteftt which resulted In the
choice of Hon. Thomas R. Bard to repre
sent California in the Senate of the
United States Speaker Anderson was
true to the cause of the people. He never
faltered. He never cringed. His devotion
to good principles and clean methods was
an example which kept the wavering in
line. Neither the railroad bosses nor the
touts of the racetrack were able to cor
rupt or coerce him. His promotion to
leadership of the young Republicans of
California is deserved.
The Republican Congressional Commit
tee of the Third District met yesterday.
Telegrams w. r<- received from Alamedans
at L<js Angeles requesting that no action
be taken v.ith reference to the district
convention until next Wednesday Indi
cations art* that a plan of conciliation will
be presented to the committee which will
j.rove acceptable to all the interests of
the party in that district and at the same
time confer upon the voters a right to ex
press at a primary election their choice of
delegates to the tonveMlon.
In the Second Congressional District
there are no signs of a contest for the
boaor of representing the district la the
fifteen months, we can get twenty engines
from America in four.'
In concluding the committee says to the
mechanic: "On December 18 the Man
chester Cotton Mills of New Hampshire,
employing 15.000 hands, added to the pay
roll JtjiXi.iMi per year, an increase of 10 per :
cent. Notices of 10 per cent advance in
wages are being posted gradually through
the manufacturing districts of the coun
try- Wages in almost every line of in
dustry have advanced. In many instances |
a Fecond and third advance has been i
made Flnce the beginning of the year. |
Yet there are those who within a few
months will be building bonfires, parading
the streets and shouting for some candi
date who will oppose the principles and
policies which have brought about this
unparalleled era of prosperity. Before
that time is reached we ask you to think
over the situation, not from the stand
point of a partisan but from the stand
point of your own personal interest and
advantage."
The next example is a letter addressed
to a livestock man at San Andreas, <'al.
He Is reminded that wool is selling for j
20 cents per pound, with eager buyers for
this year's clip. Three years apo it was
offered for 8 cents, with occasional takers.
Mutton sheep to-day are selling from $2 50
to $4 on the ranges. Three years ago

REPUBLICAN CLUB LEADERS IN THE SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
The livestock man is asked to study the
following figures: In 1836 the United
States Imported 231,000,000 pounds of for
eign wool; in 1597 350,000,000 pounds; in 1838
13'J,000,000 pounds; in 1599 100,000,000 pounds.
Were it not for the fact that there are
13,000.000 less sheep in the United States to
day than there were In 18S4, occasioned by
those In the business becoming discour
aged and quitting, the imports of ISM
would. have been much less, as a call on
the foreign product by the American man

Republican National Convention. Judge
K. C. Hart of Sacramento is an accepted
favorite and no opposition to his election
will be offered. The other delegate will
be taken from the mountain region. As-
Hurance is given that either ex-Senator
E. C Voorhlfs or Senator John F. Davis
may go to Philadelphia. If both should
decline, the honor may be tendered to
Harold Power of Placer County. The last
named will not be a candidate if Voorhies
or Davis is in the tleld. .
E.- F. Preston of San Mateo may be
ohosen as one of the delegates to repre
sent the Fifth District. Ex-United States
Senator Charles N. Felton is not a candi
date to represent the district or the State
at large. There Is some talk In San Jose
of sending O. A. Hale to the National
Convention as a delegate from the Fifth.
The Fourth Congressional District Re
publican Committee will meet next
vVednenday or Thursday evening to ar
range for primaries to elect delegates to
the district convention. Candidates for
the pleasure and honor of representing
the alstrlct at Philadelphia are like an
gels' visits, few and far between. Judge
Waymire. whose law office is In the dis
trict, would attend the National Conven
tion with pleasure, but his home happens
to be in Alameda County, where nearly
all the resident adults entertain political
aspirations of one kind or another. Hence
the Judge is almost lost in the shuffle of
his neighbors.
The Democratic State Executive Com
mittee <Seth Mann, chairman) will meot
at the California Hotel to-morrow. Can
didates for delegates at large to the Kan

scarce. It Is regarded as certain that ex-

graphs were sent to the various localities
throughout the district. Each letter con
tained a notice to the effect that on a cer
tain night there would be a public meet
ing addressed by public speakers for the
purpose of effecting an organization of a
Republican club, the purpose of which
would be to promote the renomination and
re-election of William McKinley to the
Presidency of the United States.
The first meeting of this kind was held
at Angels Camp, in Calaveras County, on
the 6th day of February, thi3 year. Since
that meeting there have been thirty club 3
registered at the committee's headquar
ters at Sacramento, which clubs in the
main were organized by the district or
ganizer of the Republican organization of
the Second Congressional District, a few
having affiliated themselves with the new
organization, but having been established
before.
These clubs now show an enrollment of
over 3000 members, which from the first
day of their organization have been stead
ily on the increase. Each club is pro
vided with a set of by-laws similar in
every respect, save those which are nro

are given additional functions by virtue

the great campaign of IiKX)
v.hich from a standpoint of ef

a parallel in the way of a similar under

men of character and ability are repre

When It Is understood that the commit
tee, by its system of registration, will
have located every voter in the Second
Congressional District, and that record
VÂ«ben completed will show his name, age,
occupation, postoffice address and politics,
en insight into the magnitude of the plan
will be had. It is probably the most per
fect and rational system that has been
ever suggested or adopted.
Now. the question naturally arises, how
can such a work as that be accomplished â
how can tiie integrity of such a record be
I!::- :::ta.:ne<3?
J:i the first place, at the outset of the
work, which is now rearing its comple
tion, a plan was adopted somewhat dif
ferent from the one now pursued. Under
the present system of club organization
the matter of registration has been taken
u;> through the clubs, and not only is
t:;ere a completeness, but the accuracy of
the information and data gathered is in
no manner impaired.
In order that a brief resume may be
given of the development of this work, it
Kill be necessary to go back to the orig
inal step, which was taken in the early
part of the summer of 1K33. The Great
Registers of all the counties were gath
ered together and from these registers the
names, ages, occupations and postofhee
addresses of all the voters ascertained.
This list, was in many respects defective,
for there were no means of ascertaining
the number of deatns and removals. As
b'jud as that information was gathered a
cluMsiflcaUon was nude, which separated
the voters a.s follows: Farmers, laborers,
mechanics, merchants, livestock men. pro
fessional men, iiquor dealers and saloon
keepers.
As soon as that classification was com
pltttd Utters were addressed to each
voter bearing upon and referring to mat
ters of special Interest to each class. In
other words, a line of argument was em
ployed which bore upon a personal inter
Â«-!-t. a personal welfare and a. personal ad
vantage.
To illustrate what is meant by this two
examples may be cited. A mechanic liv
ing at Grfdley, Cal.. is addressed by the
committee of organization. He is asked to
f?\\r his support to the present national
administration. Facts and figures are
niiimitted to convince him that h" has a
j>fTf=onal interest in the contest. The let
lÂ«r contains this appeal to the mechanic:
"We ask you to give your support to the
present national administration. Why?
Ilrcause in so doing you are lending your
j!'.:luonce and giving your approval to noli
< iÂ«s which are establishing the reputation
end standirrg of the American mechanic
on a higher and more prosperous plane
t han he has ever enjoyed before. Ameri

tives. American built bridges and Ameri

taught the necessity of giving to the clubs
maintained in the cities something In ad
dition to the ordinary work of an occa
sional campaign. With such an Idea in
view the by-laws of the city clubs, in ad
dition to the great number of committees
which are provided to country clubs, have
what is termed the committee on munici
pal legislation.
It is the duty of this committee to pro
vide reports on all situations of a political
nature as well as to gather such data aa
It can obtain pertaining to the general
field of labor. Opportunities of labor are
also reported. Matters of registration are
considered. At the same time there is no
endeavor or tendency to remove the re
sponsibility which by custom or right be
longs to the County Central Committee.
No endeavor to promote the interest of
any individual or any faction Is tolerated.
One of the conditions and exactions
made by the committee who took up the
work in response to the call of the Repub
lican State Central Committee waa that
under no circumstances Â¦would it permit
the results of its labors to be directed in
such a manner as to provide any indi
vidual with a prestige, and in carrying
out the understanding it was also agreed
that when it came to- the nomination of a
Republican candidate for Congress in the-
Second District it should not fall to Sac
ramento.
But while it is true that this com
mittee has taken no Initial steps toward
securing for any man the nomination for
Congress, when the time comes for such
a nomination to be made and when it
has been made and the choice has gone
to some other locality the Congressional
committee to be appointed by the Con
gressional convention will of course be
provided with all data and all informa
tion and be given the full benefit of the
labors of this committee, which will have
covered a period of nearly a year preced
ing the nomination.
A conference convention of the clubs
will be held at Sacramento Hay 4 and 5.
The programme at this convention will ba
as follows:

in the approaching convention, as the del

The task of organizing for effective
work in the Second Congressional District
was delegated to Judge E. C. Hart, sec
retary of the Republican State Executive
Committee. He appointed a committee
consisting of Daniel Kevane. M. J. Curtis,
"William M. Sims. James Whittaker, H.

r T"*HE California Northwestern Railway (Lessee of
I San Francisco and North Pacific Railway). "The
* Picturesque Route of California," furnishes trans
portation facilities for Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and
Lake counties, which lie north of San Francisco. Larce
and well-equior>cd steamers perform -the service on the
bay between San Francisco and Tiburon, a distance of
six and a half miles.
The road traverses Marin, Santa Rosa, Russian
River, Ukiah and onoma valleys, which are skirted by
foothills and moderate mountain ranges. All the hills
are wooded. The territory directly contiguous to the
line of the California Northwestern Railway runs from
thirty to fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean. It is not
situated in what is called the interior of California, and
therefore not subject to the great heats of that section:
nor directly on the coast, and therefore not subiect to
the fogs and winds of the Pacific Ocean. It occupies
an intermediate position wherein Sol's rays are tern- ;
percd by the ocean breezes, producing that happy me
dium â a salubrious climate.
The topography of the country, valleys, foothills,
and moderate mountain ranges, together with the salu
brious climate pervading the whole, makes this section
a natural health and pleasure resort. With over three j
hundred streams â mountain torrents, creeks and riv
ers â flowing: in all diections. there is no Mineral
Sprinc Resort, town, or hardly a ranch, not directly on
a running stream or very close to one.
Some people for their outing prefer the Mineral
Spring Resort where they can get the benefit of medi
icinal waters: some prefer the quiet home-life of the
ranch; others prefer to remain in the smaller towns.
OXE cf the features of this part cf California is the great J
number and variety of mineral springs. It is truly said |
that tiowhere Â«!Â«b on the American Continent of a similar
areÂ« axe there Â«o many mineral waters and of such varied

HENRY HAVES' DEATH
HASTENED BY WORRY
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, April 28.
EX-COUNCILMAN HENRY HAVES
died this afternoon at his residence,
626 East Fourteenth street, from an
' ' apoplectic stroke Induced by worry
ing over the implied criticism of his busi
ness dealings to which he has been sub
jected during the progress of the Brooks
will contest:
. The deceased has been a resident of this
city since 1572 and was a member of the
wholesale butcher firm of Hayes, Car
rlck & Co. and later of Henry Hayes &
Co. until the year 18tt5, when he retired
from an active commercial career. At
one time he was a City Councilman and
took a keen Interest in public affairs. For

was a partner of Mr. Hayes and the ex-
Councllman has figured prominently In
the will contest Instituted by Mrs. Alice
Wilkinson, a daughter of Brooks, which
Is now on trial in Judge Greene's depart
ment of the Superior Court.
During the progress of this case Attor
neys representing Mrs. Wilkinson, have
asked numerous questions plainly Indicat
ing an opinion that prior to his death
Brooks had been unfairly treated by his
partner. Particular stress was laid on the
burning of the books of the firm.
According to David Symmes, bookkeeper
for the old firm and a trusted employe of
the deceased for . many years, Hayes
brooded much over what he regarded as
attacks on his honesty.
Hayes himself was summoned as a wit
ness yesterday In the case. He was sub
jected to grilling cross-examination. He
was Just^ recovering from a severe at
tack of grip. When he reached home af
ter his experience In court he was so
weak that Dr. de Larue was summoned to
attend him. He felt much Improved to
day and worked for a while In his gar
den. About half-past 3 o'clock In the af
ternoon he went into his chamber to take ,
a nap and was stricken with apoplexy as
he was In the act of reclining, his death
following within a few minutes.
The deceased was born near Reedsvllle.
Mlfflln County, Pa., and was consequently
74 years of age. He leaves an estate val
ued at about J75.000. His only surviving
relatives are two brothers, living near
Reedsville, and his niece, Miss Anna
Hayes.
The remains will be shipped to Reeds
ville for interment.

VICTORY FOR THE SAN
DIEGO FLUME COMPANY
Judge Torrence Refuses to Grant the
Temporary Injunction
Prayed For.
SAN DIEGO. April 25.-Judge Torrence
In the Superior Court has decided that the
injunction asked for by the ranchers tak
ing water along the line of the San Diego
nume to prevent that company from regu
lating- the flow of -water -to them by ad-
Justing their gates, or In any way reduc
ing their supply, shall not be granted.
In his opinion, which is of general In
terest throughout the Stale, Judge Tor
rence says:
"Unless some substantial Injury Is being
done a court of equity will not Interfere.
The plaintiffs proceed upon the theory
that they are entitled to the water In the
flume and that any tampering with their
measuring boxes will interfere with their
rights. There is no allegation that the
flume company has been shutting off the
entire supply; the allegation is that the
company has prevented them from receiv
ing their whole amount.
"In a number of contracts It is stipu
lated that if a shortage occurs the water
shall be distributed equally. That exists
now. and the answer shows that there Is
not sufficient water there to supply all.
If there were no such clause they would
be entitled to a pro rata anyhow. There
is a doubt in my mind whether a preferred
right could be enforced as against other
consumers. Why should a court of equity
furnish water to two or three consumers
to the detriment of all the rest? The
grounds on which the temporary Injunc
tion Is denied is that a court of equity
will not Interfere to enforce some techni
cal right.
"The plaintiffs do not allege that the
flume company is not furnishing them
their distributive portion of the water,
and therefore I do not see any occasion
for issuing a writ of injunction. The flume
company is only apportioning the water,
and not using It."

to in time establish a court of Forestry

ger, will become the Junior past chief.
He will be succeeded by Hugo K. Asher
of this city, the grand sub-chief ranger.

grand senior woodward, may become the
sub-chief, but he will likely have opposi

J. Cordy. grand secretary, will each be
re-elected for the term. There is to be
quite a contest for the office of grand re
cording secretary. The candidates who
expect to be elected are Lee Wells of Ala
meda County, H. A. Gabriel of Santa
Clara. J. E. O'Brien of San Francisco and
11. Simon of San Francisco. For senior
woodward, which is the stepping stone to
the highest office of the grand court,
there will be a strong fight between
George D. Goldman, City Clerk of San
Diego, and Dr. W. A. Weldon of -San

Charles Hogg of Santa Clara, who is se
nior bV-adle. will in all probability be

MAKES STRONG
DEMAND FOR A
PRIMARY VOTE
Third District Republicans
Hear Views of Chair
man Reed.
Congressional Committee's Final Ac
tion Delayed in Response to a Be
quest From Absent Party
Representatives.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. April 28.
The Third Congressional District Re
publican Committee was in conference to
day upon the question of calling primaries
for the election of delepates to the State
convention at Sacramento, which will
elect delepates to the National Republican
| Convention. The sentiment of the com
j mitte was practically in favor of prlma
j ries. although Solano, Glenn and Lake
| counties' representatives thought appoint
ment â¢would be preferable in their sections.
I They said, however, that the method
I adopted by the committee would be satis
â¢ factory to their county committees. The
Alameda County members voiced them
selves almost unanimously in favor of
j primaries, and a resolution declaring that
I to be the sense of the committee was pre
'Â¦ pared, but not voted upon because of a
! request from Republicans attending the
i State Convention of Republican Clubs at
i Los Angeles to defer iinal action until
i next Wednesday.
The request was taken as an Indication
that the wilier of the party in Alameda
County headed by Dr. George C. l'ardee
was desirous of a delay until the return
of Pariiec and Assessor Dal ton from Los
Angeles. The committee, after agreeing
to the postponement, discussed the situa
tion at length. Chairman George W.
Keed made a Hat demand for primaries.
Those present were: Charles Ourner.
Solano County; E. A. Randlttt, Mortimer
Smith, W. w. Morrison, George I). Met
calf, Frank Itarnett and George W. Reed,
Alameda County; O. Pirkey held proxy of
J. S. Hendrick of Glenn County, and
George W. Heed held R. M. Beattie's
proxy from Lake County. Those not rep
resented were: Mark Chamberlain of
Yolo, J. S. Balsford of Coiusa, J. L. Geary
of Contra Costa and A. F. Schweer of
Alameda.
As soon as roll call was completed
Chairman Reed read the dispatch to Con
gressman Metcalf declaring that It was
the latter's desire that the delay be
granted.
Mr. Pirkey of Glenn County expressed
himself in favor of granting the postpone
ment, saying: "I think the pleasure of
Congressman Metcalf and the gentlemen
now In Los Angeles should be considered
In the Interests of harmony. As far as the
outside committeerr.en are concerned. It
makes no difference. The Republicans of
Glenn County will be satisfied with what
action tho committee shall take. In Glenn
County the people favor appointment. Our
county Is largely Democratic, and there
are very fÂ«-*w Republicans to hold prima
ries. There will be n:j contest, and the
people believe that by appointment the
needless expense of a primary would be
avoided."
Commltteeman Durner said the ap
pointive method was favored in Solano
County.
Chairman Reed reported that after tel
ephone communication with Committee
man Geaxy he had found the absent mem
ber from Contra Costa County in favor of
primaries.
Commltteeman Beattie of Lake County
had written that ho favored appointment
of delegates.
Commltteeman Randlett favored prima
ries. Commit teaman Durner suggested
that each county might select its own
method.
Responding to Chairman Reed's invita
tion for expression of opinion from Re
publicans other than committeemen who
were present, W. W. Knickerbocker ot
Alden and George C. Bibcock of Alameda
spoke strongly for primaries.
"But how about the legal aspect?" quer
ried Chairman Reed. "I understand that
In the Kifth District and in Los Angeles
County they have decided to appoint and
that there will be a contest. If thsir del
egates are unseated, would it not aft>ct
those from this district who wore ap
pointed?"
Commltteeman George D. Metcalf.
Judge Emil Nusbaumer and Assemblyman
Joseph Knowland of Alameda Â¦were In
favor of primaries.
Chairman Reed, who is a candidate for
national delegate, spoke at length for pri
maries. He said:
"It would eerm to me from a legal
standpoint that this enmmittee has tio
power to refer this matter to a County
Committee. The call of the National Com
mittee declares that we shall decide this
matter. I take It that there might be a
serious legal question raised If we dele
gated our powers to another body. There
Is only one course for this committee to
pursue, it seems to me, and that is to hold
primaries.
"There is no law at present to govern
this primary. It was omitted from the
Stratton primary law perhaps with the
Idea of having the matter decided by the
National Committee. It has been urged
as a substantial reason for appointing the
delegates that this committee has no
funds and that the primaries are going
to cost Fomethlng. but It seems to me that
this difficulty can be surmounted. I would'
not like to vee a contest in the State con
vention. This district needs its entire
voice there."

the broad jump. The former record was
held by A. C Kraenzlein of l-enrcsylvania
at 24 feet 44 l /2 Inches. The 100-yard dash
iigures of 0 4-5 seconds, were equaled by
A. J. Duffy of Georgetown University,
who holds the American cnampionship.
To-day's relay race carnival proved to
be x the greatest the University of Penn
sylvania has held since its inception Bix
years ago. The weather was clear and
watm, the track good ana exceptionally
fast, all the events were warmly contested
and thclargest crowa that has ever gath
ered on Franklin field to see relay races
was present. Over 100 of the large col
leges, academies and preparatory schools
in the East were represented in the various
events, and over 450 athletes were entered.
In the broad jump there were only two
contestantsâ Prinstein and Kraensleln.
The latter, who holds the world's 120-yard
and 220-yard hurdle records, has been ill
for some time and had to give up training
until a few days ago. he only jumped
twice, and the best he could uo was 23
feet ZVz inches. Prinstein took three
leaps, breaking Kraenzlein's record o"h the
jump. He was loudly cheered when the
result was announced.
Duffy, the Georgetown sprinter, ran a
strong race in the 100-yard dash, as is
proved by his equaling the world's record.
He led all the way, while his comrade
from Georgetown, K. C. Minnehan. kept
second position from the start to the fin
ish.

two-mile relay college champlonshij) from

AWAITING ACTION BY
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
The Question of Camp or No Camp
for the National Guard May Be
Answered To-Morrow.
The first orders for the blouses for the
men of the National Guarl have been
filled and the garments were distributed,
but it was found there were not enough
to fill the requisitions, so the uniform
board directed Mandel. Pursch & Co. and
the Pettlbone Company, the contractors,
to furnish several hundred more, the
work being divided between the two firms.
The first named firm refused to accept
the order, stating that it had enough of
National Guard contracts. The order was
then placed with the other firm.
It is expected that to-morrow the com
mander-in-chief will announce his de
cision in relation to the site of Santa
Cruz recommended for the school of in
struction for the guard. If it should be
favorable it is almost certain that a di
vision camp will be ordered, despite tho
aversion or some of the regiments. It is
said that if the camp is ordered it will
be purely a military one, without dally
dress parade and reviews, and that but
one review will be had, that to be on the
occasion of the visit of the commander-in
chicf.
Delay seems to be the rule in the First
Regiment of Infantry. There was delay
in petting it back into the guard after the
return from Manila, there was more delay
in the matter of electing line officers and
now there is delay in ordering elections to
fill vacancies by reason of several of the
line officers having failed to qualify. This
latter delay prevents the election of field
officers. These delays have in a great
measure discouraged the enlisted men.
who. when they signed the rolls, expected
to see the regiment in full operation
within a month after it was accepted.
First Lieutenant E. G. Hunt has-been,

POWDER MILL
AT SANTA CRUZ
DESTROYED
Tons of Powder in the
Small Glaze House
Attendants Had Fortunately lief t the
Building: and Escaped Without
Injury Beyond a Severe
Shaking-Up.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
SANTA CRUZ. April 28.â Slumbering
Santa Cruz was startled this morning at
2:60 o'clock by a force that shook things
up for several seconds, and a great re
port, followed by a loud rumbling sound
as the noise reverberated and resounded
down San Lorenzo Canyon, was evidence
enough that a heavy explosion had taken
place at the California Powder Works.
It was the smallest of the two glaze
mills and contained two cylinders with a
charge of nearly four tons of powder. J.
E. White and Sam Dunn, the men who
run tho two glaze mills at night, had Just
left the smaller one a few minutes before
it went up, and the cause of the explosion
is not known, as all was In safe running
order when the men left. No one was
killed or injured. '
The building was totally destroyed by
the explosion, and the only thing that
marks the spot where it stood is a large
hole. Even the concrete foundation under
the machinery, which was about eight feet
deep, was disposed of as though it were
sawdust. The large high board fence
along the Big Tree road was blown down
for a distance of 200 yards by the force,
and to one side of the road lies the elec
tric motor, which was blown fifty yards
or more.
The warehouse containing soda was par
tially destroyed, and the burning of the
contents lighted up the heavens for some
length of time.
The big glaze mill, which was but re
cently built to replace the one blown up
six months ago, and which is about 200
yards distant, was badly damaged.
The flying pieces of debris, machinery,
etc tore through its roof, and becoming
entangled among Its machinery stopped its
workings. The windows and doors were
torn out by the concussion.
The machinery and fragments of the
building in which the explosion occurred
are scattered far and wide among the
trees and brush that cover the hills.
This mill was built about a year ago
and the damage can only be roughly esti
mated but it amounts to several thou
sand dollars. The mill will be replaced
by a new one. __^

EASTERN MARKETS.
Xezv York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 2S.â Wall ftreet was In
clined to read the signs cf the day ea naean
trx "a little setback, la oar prosperity." The
market had B.n undertone cf depression which
did not reach to poÂ»ltlve weakness. A wa.it
lnÂ« attitude would be tht proper description.
The rej-ort* of the commercial agencies for
the week, which make tfcelr appearance on
6atur<Jay mornings, caused a feeling that In
dustrial and trade activity and buslmas pros
j*rity were not being fully maintained for the
t!mÂ» being. There are suggestions In various
; ( ;r B that rulls* prices are serving to diminish
cocevimpttoti to an extent that may necessitate
curtallcietit of production and lowering of
prices. The report for March of the Lehigh
Vallny furnished the exhibit of unfavorable re
sults In the anthracite field. The bank etate
zsent, Â¦ while a strong one according to the
ordinary role* of Interpretation, created an
unfavorable Impression. Preliminary reports
cf ti;e large Inflow of currency from the In
terior Â»erÂ« fully coiJlrnied by the statement
ThU movement In view of the ease of money
at thU center rfves fcrce to the suggestion that
tber* Is a failing oS in trade activity. ThiÂ»
view at all events was the keynote of the
Creeping tendency cf prices, to which there
were not sufficient exceptions to afiect the
general tone. The steel Industrials were special
euCerers on reports of Intended competition ty
tie Carnegie Company '.n the field for steel
end wire companies' products and the shutting
<iowa "for repairs" of a plant of the National
Steel Company. The wetk'e increase of loans
Is undoubtedly largely due to borrowing on
Â¦t*r;ing collateral. Owing to the cheapness of
money here and the relative dearnese abroad
this operation Is more profitable than drawing
tfce exchange. This operation, as well us thÂ»
export cf gold, represents the lending of money
to foreign borrowers as the country's foreign
trade continues to accumulate credits In our
favor. Reports of bank clearings do not war
rant the assumption that the return flow of
currency Is due to dlmlnibhed trade activity.
NÂ«w York and Boston are the oniy important
center* In the country to show a decrease In
cl*ar?nÂ£s for the week, compared with last
yÂ«*s. The flve other leading rtserve cities as
v.e'.\ aa the total for all other cities show in
creases running from i to over 2S per cent.
Tbe true explanation must be tiiat the ex
tension < f bsxk note circulation and the dis
bursement cash by the United States treas
ury fc** overrun the needs of circulation
ana :s forcing funds back Into the Idle re
serves cf banks. Pliers of stocks are rather
higher at tba end of this week than they were
at the end cf the last, after having been con
siderably lower. The amount of support ac
corded to prices and the extent of the demand
*t any reaction In prices naÂ» been something
cf a surprise to observer*. It was feared that
the break !n prices In the Iron trade would In
duce widespread liquidation In securities. Wall
street by tradition locks upon the Iron trade
as an Infallible index of pro^p'-cts for busi
ness conditions. Once established that Iron
and steel production has outrun demand and
that prices have reached a level to effectually
discourage end curtail consumption or that
needs fcr the future have bwn Â»o far met
as to lead to depression In Iron and eteel and
Wall rtreet is prepared to accept the evidence
as conclusive of a culmination of a prosperous
cycle, with the certainty of a period to follow
of busir.ese reaction and comparative depres
lon - On last Saturday the cut In prices by
American Bteel and Wire Company seemed
to establish the fact of such a condition in
the Iron and eteel trade, and the week opened
In consequence with evidences of general liqui
dation of stocks. The first check to the de
cline came from the powerful support by Inside
Internets in the various ptocks. It became
cuirkiy evident also that in the eteel stocks
themselves the heavieÂ«t liquidation had already
been effected by huld?rs who knew what was
coming and who had not only sold their hold-
Ing* at stocks, but had gone short of the
market at the higher level. Thus It has hap
j;enÂ«*d that the opening rale on Monday morn
ing marked the lowest price In the Iron and
Bteel movement. The eager demand from the
Fborts to rover proved an ample sustaining
force for these stocks. But Wall street be
lieved that after the bears on eteel stocks had
tafcen their profit* there might be a renewed
decline and operators continued to cell. Ru
mors began to circulate that recent confident
predictions of inaugural dividends on some
stocks and lnereaj-^s In others were not well
founded and that the f-peculatlve pools which
had cÂ»'j!"*J th*-**- predictions to be made hsd
sold out their holdings and taken their profits.
Estimates were published of th* Improvements
planned by some of the railroads. Involving such
an enormous outlay sa to threaten the absorp
tion of current Increases in earnings which have
been counted on for disbursement In dividends.
The conditions which were demonstrated 'ln the
Kteel and Wire Company had a strengthening
Influence on the sentiment on account of their
bearing on the queeiicn cf the efficacy of the
pigantlc Industrial combinations of the last
year and a half In controlling trade conditions
co fur afl to lessen th* danger of recurrent In
dustrial depresiflon. The prospect of large ex
l>orts of gold waÂ« an added factor of depres
sion. The professional bear tradeâ¢ fairly
revelÂ«Â»d in the various reactionary tendencies
and sold stocks at an open hand. They sold
â¢o freely that their demand to cover short con
tracts developed keen competition. How far
tht demand from this eource wax responsible
for the late rally In the market must wait for
clear demonstration until the further closing
out of speculative ventures and a cessation of
the excessive manipulation Incident to the con
test of speculative forces. The transactions In
Sugar make it appear that the unwary bears
had sold In the aggregate rather more than the
total etock Usue of the company. The necessity
they were under by their contracts of buying
this amount of stock to deliver placed then In
an unpleasant predlc&ment when the flowing
supply had been largely taken up by a bull
pool, who then made the most of rumors that
the sugar war was about to be settled, prices
advanced and dividends increased again. The
violent rl6e In Sugar certificates Induced a
general covering movement among the bears
and their opponents tried to add to their diffi
culties by rumors of favorable developments
bearing en values. The bulls had In their
favor continued large earnings by railroads in
every section of the country except the anthra- \
cite coalers. Strenuous efforts were made to
re-establish confidence In the prosperous con
ditions of the Iron trade, affirming the large
consumption of Iron products and the certainty
of continued demand to meet the needs of pro
jects already entered upon. The problem of
gold exports and their effect on our money
market and etock market, or rather the ex
tent of such effect. Is deferred for a short time
at least. The week's small shipments had lit
tle effect on sentiment.
Activity in bonds has been mostly confined
to special cases where Individual causes aftect- '
ed prices. The market generally was quiet.

Associated Banks' Statement.
? â *
NEW YORK, April 28.â The Financier says:
The excess reserve reported by the New York
Clearing-house banks now amounts to $10,074,
275, j. net gain of $2,179,500 during the week.
The current statement does not acTee In Its
totals, probably for the reason that the tech
nical adjustment of the accounts of the two
consolidating Institutions has thrown it out of
balance. Half the total expansion In loans and
deposits can be traced to this cause.
The principal feature of interest disclosed
by the exhibit is the gain of about $4,500,000
In cash, which resulted from operations with
the sub-treasury and the Interior. The increase
was not as large as was anticipated and Its
effect was lost in part in the gain of $9,443,100
In deposits, the latter returning an added re
serve of over $2,000,000. Loans are $7,075,300
larger. It is not notable that the added cash
holdLngs for the week are traceable to receipt
of legal tenders. This indicates operations with ]
interior banks. One event of importance was
the export of $500,000 In gold by the National
City Hank. This was largely a special transac
tion, but at the same time, with the banks
gaining from all sources. Interest rates will
probably not go higher and exports of specie
are only natural. The per capita circulation
of the United States la now at the highest
point of Its history and is Increasing. As busi
ness Is not expanding proportionately there
is nothing strange in the spectacle of a small
percentage of Idle capital seeking better In
vestment returns elsewhere. It will be useless
to predict the volume which the present export
movunent will assume, if Indeed It continues,
but since money commands better terms abroad
and there is certainly a surplus beyond present
needs here there would be nothing surprising
in a continued movement for some time to
come. But this does not imply weakness or un
favorable trade conditions. On the contrary,
it re\eals the inherent financial strength of
the country- It is not saying too much to pre
dict that exports of gold can be stopped im
mediately If the occasion arises without dis
turbing business in the least. The fact that
the United States has since ISPG absorbed one
third of the entire gold production of the
world and that present supplies are being added
to at a rate exceeding $5,000,000 monthly through
current production is often lost sight of when
the question of foreign need for gold arises.
London Market.
NEW YORK, April 29.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
The markets here were very quiet and the
tone was dull on the absence of business. The
war loan was at 1% premium.
Americans, after opening over parity, reacted.
There were no features.

The bank boucht Â£15,000 gold In bars and
Â£22.000 in German coin and received Â£7000 from
Australia. The market repaid smaJl loans to
the bank. There was an easier tendency in
discount.

Chicago Grain Market.
*;': : ; *
CHICAGO, April 28.â While wheat did not
show any great strength at the opening prices
It started a trifle higher " than , yesterday's
close and the feeling was steady. Liverpool
cables wera a trifle Improved, but were not
considered as responsive to the strength her*
yesterday. There was a fair disposition to
buy, but this disposition took shape in orders
which were scattered and generally unim
portant. The anticipated decrease in the visible
Monday and the fact that more attention is
being paid to bull news nowadays occasioned
a spasmodic advance early, but somebody be
gan relllng, presumably a long line, and the
puny bulge withered up and was blown away.
Liquidation was small, a fact especially prom
inent by reason of the nearness of delivery
day. A little export nibbling was reported and
ignored. There was little difficulty experienced
in changing options at a spread of l%c. May
ranged from 66Â©66% c to 65% c, and closed %4f s Uo
under at 65Hc; July from 67% c to 67% c, closing
%<?f%e down at 67% c. Feeling at the close
was lioavy,* while the whole session was re
maskable for its lack of action.
The corn market was dull, firm part of the
time, but closed easy. The only feature of the
trade was the early demand for May. "May

CONTRACTS FOR SHOEING
FIRE HORSES AWARDED
The Fire Commissioners met yesterday
afternoon and referred a petition from
the Eureka Valley Improvement Club
asking for a fire engine and apparatus to
the Board of Public Works and a peti
tion from the Nuevo Potrero Improve
ment Club asking that Rhode Island and
De Haro streets be repaved so that fire
engines might get into the district was
also referred to the board.
The contracts for horseshoeing In ac
cordance with the resolution passed at a

ward others of his craft and has filed
suit against the board to restrain it from
enforcing the provisions of a resolution
heretofore adopted, in which It was de
creed that those in authority in the va
rious districts should decide as to whom
should be granted the contract for shoe
ing the department horses. In his peti
tion Frisbee alleges that the object of the
resolution In question is to give into the
hands of political friends of the mem
bers of the board all of the work of the
kind mentioned. He says that such ac
tion is illegal, and that competitive bids
should be solicited.

Government and the water association
will supply the funds and the universities

professors, including Professors Soule and
