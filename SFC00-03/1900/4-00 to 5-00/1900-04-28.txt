A AEW YORK. April 27.â While the banquet hall of the Waldorf-Astoria wa s ringing to-night with applause In honor
Byjfot the hero of Appomattox, Klihu Root, with all the Impresslveness attaching to a deliberate statement from a Sec-
Mj if retary of War, gave utterance tp a warning that was received by old eoldlers present' with grim silence that was
*Â¦ * more eloquent than cheers. Secretary Root, seemingly weighing the Import of his words, carefully declared that the
time was rapidly approaching in our history as a nation when we should have to either abandon the Monroe doctrine
or fight for it. He added that we would never abandon it. and closed his period with an appeal that seemed like a fervent
prayer when he said: Â¦ -
"When that time shall come, God grant that some man like the great hero whose name we honor to-night may be raised
up to meet the issue." . . Â¦ . Â¦ : , -
Secretary Root was presiding over a dinner held in honor of the birthday of Ulysses S.' Grant. The words fraught with
such import were spoken In his opening address. He had eulogized the career of the great soldier and cited it as one for
young Americans to emulate. ,
"What was It," he asked, "that stood between us and war with France at the close of our civil -war, when Maxlmllllan.
backed by the f6rces of France, sought to establish an empire In Mexico? Nothing but the knowledge abroad that'that
Btern. sltent. Indomitable leader stood ready again to lead the armies of the United States in defense of the maintenance of
the Monroe doctrine. This is a deed of Grant's that the American people are likely to appreciate more fully as the years
roll on.
"No Intelligent man can read the signs of the : times to-day and not realize that the hour is comingâ and coming before
many yearsâ when we American people will be forced either to abandon the Monroe doctrine or else fight for it. And unless
greater wisdom and diligence in legislation is. displayed in the future than has prevailed In the past that time is likely to
arrive and find us in a state of unpreparedness.'<
"Should that happen, are we going to abandon the Monroe doctrine? Never! We may have to fight for It, but we can
never abandon it. Should such a crisis find us unprepared, oh," what would we not give then for one hour of Ulysses S.
Grant!" > r .-Â»â¢-" ' . . .-*"â¢â¢, . 'Â¦. .Â¦ â¢ . -.' i?+^'X : Â£~'*i Â¦Â¦Â¦ i:-. V;-'

are the results as viewed to-night of the
cnr.flaCTation which swf-pt this" city and
Hull yesterday and to-day. Although
under control for many hours, the flames
â¢were not entirely extinguished until about
noon to-day. The dead:

A relief committee has been formed by
tho citizens, and. together with the Cath
olic archbishops of Ottawa and Montreal,
â¢will make- an appeal for relief to the coun
try. The most serious problem that con
fronts Hull is that of wcrk. The major
ity of householders who were burn* d out
are poor and have larpe families. It is
not expected there will be employment
for a considerable- period, and how many
of the poor are going to live is doubtful.
On the Ottawa s=ido fully two-thirds ol
Dalhousle ward Is devastated and an esti
mate by residents of the district places
the number who were without roofs of
their own last night in this district at
5.000. The destroyed property here in
cluded some of the finest residences In
Ottawa, as well as a preat many of the
h'jmb'pft. In this section were the fine
houses of HGn. Mr. Foster, Dr. Scott.

neck, the French Presbyterian Church
and the Victoria Brewery, ail of which*
have disappeared.
The Ottawa Electric Company will be
a very heavy loser. An approximate
value of Its property is placed at $300,000.
The Ottawa Electric Company had six
power houses. There was one central,
or distributing power house, and the other
Jive wore auxiliary or sub-stations. Of
these sub-stations only one. that operated
by steam, remains, the other four being
destroyed. The Central power house and
the etcara auxiliary station were saved
only after a hard fight by the directors
and employes.
The fire area was viewed by thousands
of people this afternoon and evening. One
of the most remarkable things about the
ecene was that ro smoke was to be seen.
There were no half burned buildings or
smouldering logs anywhere. All of Hull's
principal buildinps. with the exception of
the Catholic Church, are things of the
past.
The bulld!nÂ»rs and land In the place are
valued at f2.000.000, and of this amount
over $1,000,000 may be put down as a loss.
PARLIAMENT BUILDING AT OTTAWA.
f The city of Ottawa stands on the south side of the Ottawa River, above the
? mouth of the Rldeau. On the opposite side and connected with it by a sus
;> pension bridce is the town of Hull, a place of s<ome 12,500 inhabitants, almost
all French Canadians, who are principally engaged in some brarch of the
lumber trade. The above "picture, taken from Parliament Hill, Ottawa.
'-â¢ shows the section of the larger city that has been devastated and the greater
Â« part of that In Hull. In both are immense lumber yards, which, with the
1 wooden houses of which both places are almost entirely built, offered quick
food for the flames.
Then in stocks, fixtures, equipment,
household effects and wearing apparel
thJÂ»ro is. a loss of nearly $3^00,000. The
vast piles of lumber which went up in
fmoke may be reckoned at $2,000,000 more.
How the Fire Started.
The fire broke out in the house of Mr.
Kirouae. on Chaudiere street, Hull. It
is said that Mrs. Kirouac was lighting her
fire to get the family dinner and set the
chimney on fire. The flames spread to
the roof and quickly communicated to
adjoining houses. There was a heavy gale
blowing at the itme, and the fire was soon
beyond control.
Hundreds of homeless persons slept in
the open air last night, or wandered about
the streets o? Ottawa and Hull, although
many houses were freely thrown open to
the homeless. Many people were accom
modated in the Drill Hall, the Salvation
Army barracks and other places.
The scene of the Hull fire to-day pre
sented a vast desert of mere ashes, out
of which the porch of Notre Dame dv
Grace, the property of the Obiates of
Mary ihe Immaculate: the St. Mary's
School, recently built at a cost of $15,000,
and a cluster of residences round the
church, r.lone are intact. Among the ruins
<-.f a house on Washington street, â¢ Hull,
to-day was found the corpse of Bernaby
Myers. All night In Ottawa the homeless
ones went about looking for places in
which to take up their abode and in some
instances searching for members of their
families.
The Â¥lf\<\y House, which was destroyed,
was a historical building. When the Duke
of Connaught visited this district thirty
years ni?o a grand ball was given him at
the "Chapel," as It was familiarly known.
A largo marquee was erected on the lawn
end here the dancing took place, the sup
per beir.g served In the house.
RELIEF FOR THOSE
WHO LOST THEIR ALL
LONDON. April 27.â The. newspapers
are unanimous in expressing the opinion
that it Is the duty of Great Britain to
promptly and substantially assist In re
pairing the losses incurred by the Ottawa
nre. The St. James Gazette voices the
Bf-nrral view, saying:
"At any time such a disaster to Canada
would have appealed irresistibly to the
sympathies of Englishmen, and the pres
ent conditions- strengthen the obligation.
Wo have plenty on our hands with the
South African war and the Indian famine,
but we shall not be backward In doing
all we can for our Canadian brothers till
the bottom dollar Is reached."
There Is considerable excitement in
.Edinburgh insurance companies on ac
count of the fire, as all the companies are
heavily involved.

TON HOTEL, "WASHINGTON, April 27.â
Early adjournment of Congress is now as
sured. Between the Democrats and the
Republicans of the two branches a full
understanding has been reached, which
will result in adjournment shortly after
the Ist of June.
Not until to-day did the Republican
leaders in the Senate give up the hope of
passing the subsidy bill and the army re
organization bill at this session, but to
night they know that It is Impossible to
push either through. This knowledge was
brought to them in a most emphatic man
ner by Senator Jones of Arkansas and
other minority leaders. Senator Pettus,

In speaking on the Scott case, gave the
Republican leaders a hint of what they
might expect if they continue their en
deavors to put the two bills, which the
Democrats object to, through the Senate.
An Informal conference was held this
afternoon, at which Senator Frye was
told that dilatory tactics would be resort
ed to at every opportunity unless the Re
publicans would agree to make no attempt
to bring up the subsidy bill or the army
leorganization bill. Senator Jones gave
full assurance that the Democratic Sen
ators were in accord on this subject,
whereupon the Republicans acquiesced,
thereby sealing the doom, so far as this
session goes, of two of the most important
measures which have been framed since
the present Congress convened.

conclusion that it will still be necessary
to employ a considerable body of troops
to keep the Free State clear of Boers.
The position is that the Boers, who be

Advance to Pretoria Not Begun.
Meanwhile the advance to Pretoria has
not begun. Small wonder Is It that muf-
Iled complaints and criticisms are begin
ning to be heard here and there against
Lord Roberts. Two-thirds of his entire
force. have been employed In effecting
this small satisfaction, and the probabil
ity Is that the whole force must again
be concentrated on Bloemfontein before
the main advance begins. As similar
raids on the British communications are
likely to be repeated. It Is evident that
Pre^ria's capture is still a long way off.

"There appears to be little chance of In

Louis Botha, who arrived at Dewetsdorp
on Monday, realized the situation at ence

the Boers both from there and from Wcp

The Bloemfontein correspondent of the

says:
"Latest reports show that the Boers

The Bloemfontein correspondent of the

says:
"The Boers who retreated from Dewets

Other Bloemfontein dlspatehea throw
interesting points of light upon the situa

a Boer heavy transport train have reached
Krconstad from the south. Only light
wagons have been left behind. The Boers
have organized a specially mounted corps

MILNER INTERCEDED
IN WARREN'S BEHALF
LONDON. April 27.â The following dis
patch has been received at the War Of

"BLOEMFONTEIN. April 26.â At the
request of the High Commissioner, War
ren has been appointed military gover
nor of Griquiland West while that part
of the country Is In a disturbed condi
tion."
Lord Roberts' peculiar reference to Sir
Alfrefl Milner over Warren's appoint
ment lends itself to the Inference that the
commander-In-chlef of the British forces
in South Africa scarcely approves of it,
and that the previous report that War
ren had been recaned was correct, but
that he was saved from coming home by
the action of the British High Commis
sioner.

General Merriam Gives His
Version of the Trouble
at VVardner.
Contradicts Nearly All Statements in
Resolution Authorizing Ap
pointment of Investiga
tion Committee.
>
Â¦ WASHINGTON*. April 27.â At the Coeur
d'Alene investigation to-day the principal
witness was General Merriam, who de
scribed in detail his orders from the War
Department and the assembling of trcopa
there by his orders. His orders to his In
ferior officers were that arrests and seiz
ures were to be made by deputies under
the protection of troops. He was, he salil.
very careful on this point. He said that
the prisoners at all times were better
sheltered from the weather than were tl-.e
troops. There was. however,' a deficiency
in bedding. He denied that he had held
any conferences with mine owners' or
managers, but said he had several times
talked casually with mine operators who
came to or were passing through Ward
ner.
General Merriam stated positively that
he had never been in the room where the
inquest was held at Wardner. denying the
statement of Attorney Robertson to that
effect. Mr. Robertson reported to the
State that he had been under the impres
sion that General Merriam had been pres
ent. General Merrlam's testimony fol
lowed closely the lines of his report. Dur
ing twenty-eight years of service, he said,
he had never known a soldier to strike a
prisoner with a musket or jab with a
bayonet. Such testimony, he said, there
fore, to him was utterly incredible. He
declared most emphatically that a state
of rebellion existed in Idaho and that
there was a menace to public safety
there. He took up each section of the
preamble of the resolution under the op
eration of which the committee was act
ing, denyinK absolutely most of the fact 3
alleged therein.
General Merriam said the United States
troops were in charge of the prisoners
simply as guards in carrying out the au
thority of the State. The general said he
felt solicitous as to the prisoners and to
their long confinement. He finally took
up the matter with the War Department,
telegraphing on the subject. Two of the
letters had not heretofore appeared in the
correspondence furnished by the War De
partment, evidently having been mislaid.
In these letters General Merriam pointed
out the evident purpose of the Idaho au
thorities to continue the military control
for some time and referred to the ad
journment of the District Court, with the
cases of many of the prisoners still pend
ing. In one of the letters General Mer
riam advised that a part of the troops be
withdrawn. He stated also that the con
tinued service of the troops on guard duty
had led to the bribery of a sergeant and
the escape of eight prisoners. At present.
General Merriam stated, the troops were
not guarding any prisoners. A few troops
remained in garrison in the locality, but
without having any duties in connection
with the disturbance, although available
in case of an outbreak so long as martial
iaw continued. General Merriam's cross
examination will begin to-morrow.

There is an "honest tired feeling," caused
by necessary toil and cured by natural rest.
But very different is "that tired feeling," from
which so many complain and which may
even be classed as a disease. That tired feel-
ing takes yoii to bed tired and wakes yon up
tired. You have no appetite, have bilious
taste, dull headache, are nervous and irritable,
blue, weak and discouraged. In such condi-
tions Hood's Sarsaparilla does a world of good.
It begins in the right place â in the blood,
purifying it and imparting vitality; then its
tonic effect is felt by the stomach, 'Kidneys
and liver; appetite returns, waste is removed
naturally, headaches cease/ that tired feeling
departs and you feel like anew person. Take
Hood's and only Hood's. Get it TODAY.

his 3-year-old daughter from In front of

despite the heartrending protestations of
the young mother lashed the horses into
a gallop an<l disappeared. He proceeded
to the Southern Pacific depot and is now
well on his way East.

LONDON. April 27.â The newspapers

added, is sending a commission to the

Tho commission includes the managers of

ORO VILLE. April 27.â Just at sunset
this evening the iiesta parade start
ed from the Native Sons" arch and,
winding through the streets, final
ly found its way to the Courthouse
square, where the queen was crowned. It
was th*> prettiest night Oroville has seen
in years. Decked in wreaths of roses and
riding a prancing black horse Mrs. G. W.
Braden. the assistant grand marshal of
i the parade, led the column. Wreaths of
! roses were round her horse's neck;
| wreaths of roses hung from her shoulders
. and roses hid her saddle blanket and sad
dle girth. Then came the Oroville band,
the your.g ladies' drill corps in white, and
then the children's float, where little Les
le Jones. qu?en of tht fairies, and her
twelve spritely little nymphs rode. Then
followed the children of the school
dressed in white and with white caps, and
wreaths, of roses twined round their shou!-.
ders. The queen. Miss Josephine Bader.
followed the children, riding on a float
decked in white roses and ferns and rep
resenting a throne. She was attended by
her pages, Mattie Webber and Maud
Wills, and by her four maids of honor.
Mlfs Viola Evans. Mips Gertrude Mc-
Smith Miss Mildred Martin and Miss Lib
bio Marks. The queen was gorgeously at
lired in royal robes; the pages were
dressed in red and the maids of honor in
pure white. ." ' Â¦'
Just after the queen came the boys and
girls of the High School, the girls in white
and carrying white parasols, and both
boys and girls were twined with wreaths
of 'red and white and yellow roses. The
bear float came next, a rustic structure
with a bear riding upon it. and the whole
brilliant with poppies, and after the bear
float came the deeocafd carriages. Ihere
was auite a number of them and it was
hard to cnoose the prettiest. Roses-red
pink yellow and whiteâ were the basis of
most of the decorations, and the tastes of
the drivers ran from a few dainty
bunches on a wheel or canopy to a
smother of blossoms.
Crowning of the Queen.
At the Courthouse a throne, raised high
above the heads of the people, and fes
tooned with lilies and smilax. had been
erected and there fhe queen was escorted
by her prime minister. H. R. McNoble.
the newly elected grand orator of the Isa
tive Sons. She was preceded by the
fairies who grouped themselves around
the throne, and was followed by her pages
and maids of honor. The square was
packed with people.
As the queen reached .the throne tho
childish voices of the school children in
the distance burst forth in a song of
greeting, and wh^n this had died away
the prime minister addressed the qu*en.
"Gracious lady." he said, "by direction

through their programme. The supper
was hurried through and on the 4 o'clock
train the delegates commenced to leave.
About fifty left then and over a hundred
more left at noon. The remainder will go
out on the early train to-morrow and Oro

may well be proud of. The success of the
cplebrÂ«tloj> was to tho unalloyed
good will <Â»f the people, their earnest de
sire to please and the willing way in
which they worked together. Every one
worked, and none worked any the less
from the fact that his individual efforts
were lost sight of in the grand success of
the whole. Each committee had its own
work to do and in its own line each com
mittee was supreme. The executive com
mittee was formed of the chairmen of the
fourteen sub-committees, who in turn ap
pointed their own committee* and were
responsible for their work.
Major Jones, as chairman of thÂ« exec
utive committee, had general supervision
over all. George W. Braden took entire

UNCLE SAM'S LATEST NOTE
. \
Though a Time Limit for an Answei
Is Not Pixed, the Demand Is
ICot Far From an Ulti
matum.
CONSTANTINOPLE. April 26.â The
American note handed to the Turkish
Minister of Foreign Affair*. Jewflk
Pasha, on Tuesday, is couched in peremp
tory term?, demanding Immediate pay*
ment of the indemnity several times
promised to Minister Straus by the Sul
tan. The note does' not fix a time limit
for an answer, but its tenor is not far
from the character of an ultimatum. Ii
lias produced a great impression on the
Porte, which, however, shows no dispo
sition to modify the attitude hitherto
maintained, namely, repudiating the re
sponsibility and seeking to diminish the
importance of the matter. It is presumed
that the Porte's reply will be in this
sense, and hence it is feared the United
States Government will bo obliged to take
MejÂ»s jo enforce its demands.
Turkey's decision to send an officer ttt
America to study naval construction is
interpreted to be another sop. It is the
revival <>f :-.n old project to buy a cruiser
in the United States, in the price ol
which the Indemnity shall be included, so
that the Porte will !Â«> able to say it has
not paid the indemnity. The American
Oovprnment has already categorically, re
fused such a compromise, which would
mÂ«-an prolonged negotiations and the
dragging out of the matter indefinitely,
to which the United States will not listen.
-As regards the indemnity, it Is in the na
ture of a debt of honor. If the Porte
wants to buy a cruiser, that is a matter
in nu way connected with the indemnity.
The Porto's reply to the last collective
note on the subject of duties has not
!>e< n made, and the Embassies are ex
changing views in regard to the term.*
on which to consent to an increase of
duty. It is thought that before the be
ginning of negotiation!? the Kmbassies*
will invite the I'orte to abolish ran-
BOtna and measures introduced in viola
tion of treaties. t
SULTAN'S PROPOSITION
CANNOT BE ACCEPTED
WASHINGTON. April 27.-Beyond the
statement that Mr. Grjsc-om, United States
Â«'harge d'Affaires at Constantinople, has
in en instructed to press vigorously for the
jiavmcnt of American claims for indem
nity, the officials here decline to divulge
th<- nature of his instructions. They say
that Mr. Griseom does not need express
Instructions to forward the claims, for he
had of his own volition taken a rather
advanced position in this matter and the
representations he is now making, though
this time by exprÂ»-!-s instruction, are in
jio resect more peremptory ihan his own
preceding deliveries to the Turkish Gov-
Novel though the proposition wai from
it diplomatic standpoint, yet it is learned
to hf- true that the effort was xrwde by
the Porte to pay this American claim un
der cover of an ordT for a warship to he
built in the United States for Turkey. The
reasons lor the failure of the project were
eeveril,' The United States Government
his? no war^hijis for pale and is not au
thorized to build any for foreign order.
Th'-n there is no warrant of law for en
tering into an arrangement with a private
s-ihin huilding concern for the collection of
Sin intr>rnati<inal obligation in thK- manner
proposed. Lastly, judging by the
t-nce oi crinc-rns that h;ivr- had dealings
with the Turkish 'Jovr-mment. any ship
builder accepting the order from Turkey
wo\)!d require a guarantee from th<*
United States Government; and the net
result of the transaction miaht be the as
sumption by the United Stated of an ob
litratifin as much larger than the original
<!;i:inp a? the price of a battleship *>x
ndis the F9O-JOOQ. Even if these obstacles
Â¦were overcome the schema would be an
uttT failure as concerns the arromplteh
ment of thÂ»=- primt- obtect-^-namely. th<> se
rr*t payment to thf United States of thÂ«
indemnity v.ith a vif-w to avoid Â«i*"rnai!<is
from oth*-r nations for settlement of th^ir
claims, lor under our open methods of
liapinrsp the transactions would have to
ho a matter of official record.
QUEEN OF THE FIESTA
CROWNED AT ORO VILLE
NEW GOVERNOR
OF PORTO RICO
IS RECEIVED
Charles Albert Allen Reaches
His Post in the City of
â¢ San Juan.
No Demonstration Marks His Land
ing and Citizens Are Surprised
at Simplicity of Reception
Arrangements. .
? .. .
SAX JUAN, Porto Rico. April 27.â The
United States ship Dolphin, . bearing
Charles Albert Allen, the newly appointed
Civil Governor of Porto Rico, dropped
anchor off San Juan .at 10 o'clock this
morning', as did also the United States
armored cruiser New York, the United
States battleship Texas and the United
States gunboat Maehias. The New York
remained outside the harbor.
Governor General Davis, Military Gov
ernor, visited Mr. Allen on board the
Dolphin at 11:30. A detachment of sev
enty-live insular police and tour compa
nies of the Porto Rlcan regiment, with a
band, were drawn up on tne wharf. 'The
Dolphin's launch, carrying Mr. Allen and
his family, with General Davis and Lieu
tenant Parker, the lattt-rs aid, left the
Dolphin promptly at noon, the Texas and
Dolphin nriiiK Ji salute of seventeen guns.
Meanwhile tne band played "Borinquen."
the Porto Rican national air, and the
steamers lying in the harbor kept up a
continuous whistling until the launch
reached the landing.
Mr. Allen ran quickly up the steps and
the families of General Davis and the new
Civil Governor were introduced to each
other.
A crowd of 5000 looked on, but was kept
at a distance. The police and troops
marched past at port arms, Mr. Allen
dotting his hut. He then entered the car
riage that was in waiting and drove to
the executive mansion, preceded by troops
and followed by squads of police. He con
stantly raised his hat to the throng that
lined the sidewalks.
Mr. Allen took breakfast with General
Davis and with his family will remain
as the guest of General Davis Indefinitely.
He landed in an ordinary costume, straw
hat, blue coat and duck" trousers, and a
wave of exclamations followed the car
riage.
"It cannot be the Governor, said one.
"That's not the new Governor, saiu
another. , , ?
"Not that man in the straw hat, surelj ,
said another. , ,
The simplicity of the costume and of
the general details of the reception took
Porto Rico by surprise, and the citizens
could scarcely realize that they looked
upon the new Governor. Mr. Allen is the
first Governor of Porto Rico to arrive In
anything less conspicuous than a gorgeous
uniform covered, with gold lace and simi
lar trappings.
Few representative citizens were present
at the landing, the throng being composed
largely of middle class people. Nor was
there 'any attempt to decorate the build
ings, and generally the reception was no
tably unenthusiastic. One Porto Rican
explained the lack of popular demenstra
tivenoss by saying that the people were
dissatisfied to find that the civil govern
ment would not actually be in full force
on May 1, as they had hoped.
In the course of a brief Interview Mr.
Allen contradicted the report that he
would return to the United States alter a
conference with General Davis. He de
sires to settle the details of the new re
gime as soon as possible and will remain
here conferring with General Davis pend
ing the arrival of the new appointees.

PETS OF DCG FANCIERS
THE officials of San Francisco
Kennel Club are delighted
with the prospects for the
success of their fourth annual
show, which opens in Mechanics"
Pavilion on Wednesday next. The
entry is both large and representa
tive, and the exhibition is expected
to attract a large number of spec

WILL DECIDE
THE BASEBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP
University of California to
Pyioet Stanford To-Day at
San Jose-
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 27.â
The Jlnal baseball game between the* rival
colleges and which will decide the series
will be played in San Jose to-morrow. To
the winner of this contest go the Honors
of the intercollegiate baseball champion
ship for the season. The University of
California team won the first match on
the Berkeley campus, on April 7. by a
score of 10 to 8. The following Saturday
the Stanford boys evened up the account
by taking the game played on their own
campus by a score of 10 to 7. The car
dinal team surprised all by developing a
remarkable strength in batting and base
running, while the work of Lanagan in
the box was above the average. Twelve
men were fanned out, only three allowed
a base on balls, and but seven hits nere
made off him.
In to-morrow's contest the Stanford
battery should do equally as effective
work, while their support will undoubted
ly be stronger. Captain Strohm has
traded his place at third base with Brown,
who played second in the last game. This
puts both of the men in their accustomed
places, and will do much to strengthen
the infield. Havens at iirst has shown
improvement and can be depended upon
to cover his ground well. Cowden will
be seen In left field, and with Murphy
arid Symonds ought to accept every
chance offered. .Coach Murphy considers
that his men go' into the match to-mor
row in the best condition they have at
tained during the season, and predicts
success for the cardinal if the men
hold together at critical points.
A special train leaving the Stanford
campus at 1:15 p. m. will take a large
crowd of rooters down to witness the
match. ' ' ,â '
The Stanford men will line up as fol
lows: ,
Loughead, c; Edwards,, ss.; Strohm,
2b.; Havens, lb.: Cowden, If.; Symonds,
rf.; Brown. 3b.; Lanasan; p.; Murphy, cf.
The University of Nevada and Stanford
track teams will meet on the Stanford
oval on May 5. With the exception of
the mile walk all the ordinary events "will
be run off. Stanford will enter two men
in each event, and only first and second
places will count. : j '* '- Â¦
DOC SHOW JOTTINGS.
The bench show committee of the San
Frari<-i<co Kennel Club is resting; tempo
rarily from Its labors. The entries have
been classified and the catalogue is in the
hand? of the printer. The sub-committee
on the Pavilion has reported that the big
buildinp will be In complete readine?s on
the opening morning, next Wednesday. An
entirely new arrangement of the kennels
has bf-Vn planned the effct of which will
be to Rive the dogs ot the smaller breeds
a more conspicuous position than thty
have enjoyed at previous shows. That
norhir.pr may be left undone to secure the
pi* -i^ure and satisfaction of the exhiblt
< rs tbe vc-teran secretary, Harry Carlton.
has been induced to r-merge from" his
'Â¦cur.try rctrt-at In order to jdve. the club
the benefit of his expeiier.ee and executive
ability.
The display of special prizes has never
,been eguaU-d west of Chicago and is an
eloquent testimonial to the energy and
popularity of the comrr.ll tee.
A scrutiny of the lint of <ntriep discloses
a. remarkable falling off in St. Bernards,
and as remarka'ile an ir.rrejise in cocker
ppaniels. Almost every other breed shows
an augmentation of numbers. A feature
<-,i the show will be the numerous fox ter
riors that have been brouprht out from the
Kast, among them btinj; N. H. Milkman's
Warren Sceptic, Wnrn-n Supple ar.d Klm
Â¦wood Vassar, and George Bell's Mast and
Cigarette. The Spokane Kennels have en
tered a couple of Boston terriers that will
probably make short work of the local
doss' chances of winning. Two entries of
ihis hi- on had to be refused by the oJli
oialP of the club, as the dogs had been
mutilated.
Charles N>wman will exhibit hi? hand
cone and clever trick doK. the thorough
lirfd St. Bernard. Golden Lion. It is likely
ihHt that sagacious boast will carry off
the b!ue ribbon of his class, as he is very
clever.

AMONG THE GOLF PLAYERS
During the summer months the Pre
sidio golf links will be the scene of many
friendly matches, but no scheduled tour
nament will take place there. The golfers
will ho found on the links at Burlingame,
Menlo Park, the Hotel del Monte, Santa
Cataltaa and other resorts. Many of the
well known Presidio players, such as E.
J. McCutchen. C. P. Pomeroy. C. P. Eells
and Miss Alice C. Hoffman, will play on
the San Rafael links. The directors of the
Sar. Rafael Golf Club have been waiting
for the weather to become settled before
preparing a schedule, but it is not un
likely that the season may be opened next
Saturday.
The San Rafael links have recently been
visited by John Lawson and oilier mem
bers of the San Francisco Golf Club, who
have expressed themselves as being much
pleased with the course. Recently John
Lawson played 27 holes against George
Smith, the new professional at San Ra
fael. George Smith has as many pupils
as he can well take care of. He is spoken
uf as an excellent instructor, even better
than his brother, W. B. Smith, the open
champion of the United States. The lat
tc-r pays more- attention to keeping up his
own game than to teaching. During the
past week there have been many visitors
from San Francisco and Oakland at the
San Rafael links.
Golfers will soon be able to pursue the
"gulty" in the Santa Ana Valley, James
Irvine of the San Joaquin ranch having
given to the Santiago Golf Club permis
sion to use as much land as may be re
quired for links in the foothills between
El Mod^na and the County Park. The
club has accepted the offer and the links
will soon be ready. Henry Baechtel of
the San Joaquin ranch, secretary of the
club, and Henri Gardner of Orange, the
committee appointed to select and lay rtut
the grounds, visited them in company
with H. W. Grindley, instructor anil
preenkeeper of the Los Angelees Country
Club, and settled on the jilaces for teeing
grounds and putting greens. The first
drive will be from the top of a small
rounded hill which commands a view of
the whole course. On this knoll a hand
rome clubhouse with broad verandas will
be built.
Recently oi the Morris County links
William Shippen. during a tournament,
drove a ball into an apple tree, where It
lodged firmly between two twigs more
than fifty feet above the ground. It was
dislodged by throwing sticks at it. and one
stroke being counted for the descent of
tho ball from the tree the game was con
tinued.
The course of the Belmnnt Golf Club,
which was laid out by D. Stephenson. will
be formally opened to-day with a break
fast, a dance and a tournament. Guests
will leave the city by the 9 o'clock train
from Third md Townsend streets, and on
arriving at Belmont will be driven to the
linkr- At noon there will be a luncheon,
which will be followed by a dance at
Rp'Ts School. Con.mittefs on reception.
<lecÂ»-ation, refrÂ«shrr>ents and invitatirns
have been appointed. H. Kruttschnitt be
ing th'i general chairman.
TENNIS CRACKS ON EDGE.
This is the season when the tennis en
thusiasts swing their rackets and prepare
for the big tournaments of the summer.
At the California Club courts the players
are slowly working into form for the
championship event of the year. To-mor
row afternoon the first big class tourna
ment will be held on the club courts.
All the active members will be entered
in the tournament, which will be a class
affair. Tho racket wielders will bs divided
Into four classes, the winners of each to
play off for honors and the prizes. In
the* first class will be George Whitney
and Robert N. Whitney. George, the
usual victor in the brother-against
brother matches, will find a hard game
when he meets "Bob" this time, for the
latter has had considerable practice dur
ing the last four weeks. In the second
class will be Root, Bliven, Crowell, Col
lier and Harry Welhe. On present form
Weihe looks to be the winner of his class
In the third class Werner Stauf, Drum
monil McGavln, Harry Halght. Merle
Johnson and J. A. Code will compete for
honors. All these men play about the
same standard of game, and the battle
for first place will be a hot one. Entered
in the fourth clnss v.-11l be Duval Moore.
Paul Jones, Arthur Watson. H. Duprcy
and Harry Kuehn. Fair handicaps have
been fixed between classes.
Another tournament is in process of
formation. If the Ist of May is declared
a legal holiday there will be either an
impromptu singles or doubles tournament
on the California Club courts. During
the week there have been many exciting
practice matches and the interest in the
game has always been at high pitch.
Judge Hunt and Judge Troutt have been
active participants In specially arranged
matches and there Is great rivalry be
tween them for tennis honors.
The intercollegiate tennis tournament
laÂ«t Saturday developed but a slnele sur
priseâthe defeat of Braley. the California
nlayer who distinguished himself last
September at Del Monte. He gives as an
excuÂ«a too much baseball ana too Httlo
tennis. '
Battle Between Mongolians.
SANTA CRUZ, April 27.â Yesterday on
W. H. Albright's place, near Watsonvllle.
fourteen Chinamen and three Japanese
had a pitched battle, during which one of
the latter had his skull fractured by a
piece of wood. One Chinaman was ar
rested and the officers are looking for
the others suspected.
Whales Off Monterey.
MONTEREY, April 27.â A school of
over ICO whales Is now in Monterey Bay
and very near shore, presenting one of
the most wonderful sights ever seen here
abouts. Fishermen say that the caust
of this visitation Is that the very high
winds of the past three days have driven
sardines, on which whales feed chiefly,
in Immense numbers inside the harbor,
and the whales have followed their prey.
Old whalers are authority for the state
ment that so great a number of whiles
at one time have not been seen here
about for over thirty years.
CALIFORNIA'S
TRACK TEAM
STARTS EAST
Captain Drum Says the Men
Are in Excellent Condition
for Battle.
BERKELEY, April 27.â The track team
of the Unlversltv of California left on
this evening's train for the East, via Og
den. At the station there were several
hundred students to say farewell. There
was a rally without speeches. It being
more in the nature of a friendly fare
well than a college ilemonslraiion.
As tne ten memui'rs of tiie team board
ed the local train tne university yell was
i yen and college songs sung. i.lany of
ti.Â« stuuents accompanied the team tv the
Sixteenth-street station, where another
farewell was given.
All or the men are in splendid condition
and ready to baale for tneir alma mater.
Each nan feels confident of winning
points tor his team in the dual meets
with tho Eastern colleges. At any rate,
every man will do his best to sustain the
reputation of California's athletes for
gentlemanly conduct and spirit. Captain
Drum expressed himselr as pleased with
the condition of his men, and believes a
number of surprises will be given the
Kastern colleges. The team feels the less
of Ben BaKewell, who was taken sud
denly ill. but puts its faith in T. Hamlin
for the hurdles. K. R. Service was taKen
with the team the last minute, funds
having boen raised by means of private
subscription. Service has trained con
sistently during the season and Is a very
valuable man. He is an all-around ath
lete, and does the mile, half-mile and
broad jump. He will probably act as al
ternate with Woolsey in the half-mile and
Moser In the mile runs. Manager Ezra
Decoto and Trainer George Hufferdine
accompanied the team.
WILL TEST THE
POWERS OF A
DOG OF NOTE
Match Between E. Geary's
Greyhound Paio Alto and
Curtis' Beacon.
The management of Union Coursing
Park has arranged a match for to-morrow
afternoon which is unusually attractive in
the eyes of the leashmen. Eugene Geary's
young dog Palto Alto, a son of Emm
Pasha, Is to measure strides with Curtis
& Son's blue dog Beacon. If these are not
tho fastest greyhounds on the coast few
men would care to name a brace to beat
thorn. They will run their first course
before the intermission for luncheon to
morrow. Beacon Is expected to be a slight
favorite, as he has had more experience
than Palo Alto.
The stake for this week was closed with
120 entries. Coursing will commence to
day upon the arrival of the 11 o'clock
train. Luxor, Chicago Boy, Flora Mc-
Donald. Thornhlll, Lavender. Cavalier, St.
Anthony. Brutus. Vulcan, Rock Island
King. Kid McCoy, Crawford Lad, Lottie
M, St. Oran: Ireland. Hot Haste. Flying
Fox, Warship, Royal Anne and other
greyhounds of note are entered.
The six dogs imported by J. H. Rosseter
will be sold at auction to-morrow during
the noon intermission. It is expected there
will be some lively bidding for them, as
they are all good representatives of the
best winning strains In England.
A ninety-six dog ptake for non-winners
is the card for ingleside. The entry is
unusually high class, as many good dogrs
run well into a stake without being able
to win either first or second money.
Coursing will begin to-day at 12 o'cl.ock
and to-morrow at 10:30.
James Lawlor's imported dog Fetter
Free will never be seen in competition
here. The injury to bis leg. which he
broke on Monday in a private trial with
J. O'Phea's Golden Rule, precludes the
possibility of fitting him for a stake. He
will be retired to the stud, and should
prove a valuable acquisition to the breed
ing interests, lie showed himself a fast
dog and unusually game. He finished his
cyur.-e with Golden Rule on three leijs
an.l killed the hare.
The imported dog.- Overture and Temple
indulged in a little mix-up on Thursday,
from which both emerged the worse for
thÂ»ir encounter. Temple was severely
bitten, the Irish do? escaping with some
minor wounds. James Sweeney, the
trainer, was severely bitten about the
wrist in trying to separate his fighting
charges.
R. K. Malcolm's English dog Fine Fire
will not go to the slips again until he is
pronounced in condition. His trial with
and defeat of For Glory last Sunday in
oicates that he will be among the first
flight when he rounds into form. .
A. C. Lighthall of Denver lost a valuable
greyhound at the Pasha Kennels some
days since. She arrived in bad condition
and died of exhaustion. She was sent to
be bred to Hmln Pasha. Mr. I.igrhthall
was particularly unfortunate with hin
greyhound. He sent her to England to be
mated with the great Fullerton. The lat
ter died abo-.it the time she reached there.
She was bred to another Hngllsh dog. but
there was no issue. She was next bred
to Hughle, and all three puppies are down
with distemper and are not expected to
recover. â¢
Frank McComb"? Miss Skyrocket has
been mated with Aeneid Kennels' Pre
tender.
The San Jose Cnurslns: Club officials
have announced the reopening of their
park to-morrow. If patronage warrants
the sport will be promoted all summer.
TROUT STREAMS
YIELD A FAIR
MEED OF FISH
No Anglers Returned Last Sat
urday With Empty Creels
From Near-by Pools.
All the anglers who fished the trout
streams easily accessible from tlils city
last Sunday secured fair returns for their
efforts. The majority had from eight to
ten fish In their creels. The conditions this
week are more favorable for fishing and
better sport Is promised.
Reports from the Truckee are to the
effect that trout are -taking the fly all
along the river. No big catches have been
reported except In the vicinity of Verdi.
The run of spawn fish at the Shovel
Creek station on Klarr.ath River has
ceased. The total take was over 600.000
eggs, the best results In three years. The
run of spawn fish at Truckee has been
light during the past ten days. The sea
son will clcse on May 1 with a total take
of 550,000 eggs. At Lake Tahoe station
spawn fish are still numerous. The total
take of eggs at two stations will be 3.000.
<XK). The Wawona hatchery on thÂ» south
fork of Merced River in Yosemite Nation
al Park Is In operation, eggs having been
shipped there from Shovel Creek and Ta
hoe stations. The fish hatched at this sta
tion will f>e planted in the lakes and
streams of the Yosemite.
Fish Commissioners Vogelsang and
Gould visited the United States salmon
hatchery at Baird on the McCloud last
week. While on the ground they fished
two evenings, securing 3ume tine speci
mens of trout. i_ -
A. S Caiman, George Morse. Edward
Everett and Walter Carr postponed their
.projected trip to the McCioud until next
week. It is expected weather conditions
will be more settled by that time and that
there will be a corresponding improvement
in the sport. They expect to make their
headquarters at Raymond's cabin. If
they decide to do so they will go in over
the Salt Creek trail and will not touch at
Baird.
The rain of last week was heavy on the
I'ppf-r Sacramento River and the water
was greatly discolored Saturday and Sun
day, preventing the use of the fly. If
weather conditions permit A. L. Coombs
and wife and Bert Noyes and wife will
test the fly fishing to-day and to-morrow
in the Sacramento near Sims.
Charles S. Wheeler and wife went to
their beautiful summer home on the Mc-
Cloud last Wednesday week, returning to
this city last Monday. They enjoyed the
novelty of a heavy snowstorm while on
the river. After the storm the weather
changed to warmer and Mr. Wheeler se
cured some fine fish with a fly. A num
ber of house parties are being arranged
for the season and much pleasure Is ex
pected from them.
Charles Huyck and F. M. Haight fished
Olema Creek lnst Sunday. They secured
ten trout, the largest being eleven Inches
in length.
Charles Precht secured nine trout at
Point Reyes, while Messrs. Daverkosen
and Turner secured between them twenty
at -Paner Mill. , ,
Frank Dolllver landed a 7V4-pound steel
head at Point Reyes.

From Santa Cruz and Monterey come
reports to the effect that salmon fishing
was unusually good early this week. As
high as 100 were killed last Sunday. the
fish running from twenty to forty pounds.
Striped bass have been seen In numbers
Jn Oakland estuary, but few of them have
been caught.
A well-known fisherman sends the fol
lowing communication with the additional
comment that all the statements can be
substantiated, and are of Interest to
sportsmen. He writes:
' Xotlnir In one of thÂ» daily papers of Satur
day last that the flshlnjr In Purisslma Creek
promised to be unusually rood this season
I des're to correct such delusion. The flsh
are unusually small this yeÂ«r and the catch
on April 1 lwhÂ»n all conditions were favor
able) I am told averaged only about 25 per
cent of that of lajt yfar. On one occasion
I saw an Individual (whose Identity I was
unable to learn, but who probably flattered
himself with the belief that hÂ» was a gen
tlf>m?n and a sportsman) catch in a few
minutes six minnows, not one of which was
ovrr three and a half Inches In lensrth. I
did not see h!m rr Â«ny one else catch a fls'n
of re?p<* c tnble *ize and the baskets obtained
' werÂ« *mall. Twenty-five thousand trout
were planted In tha stream during the last

true sportsman will return tfÂ» the stream at
least 50 per cent of his catch in the Purls

Standing of the Various
Teams of the League
Up to Date.
The race for the pennant in the Cali
fornia Baseball League has started most
auspiciously and the indications are that
the struggle this season will be a hot one.
The attendance at the games in all the
league towns has greatly increased and it
is evident that the lovers of the sport are
out in force. It was fortunate for the
league that the national agreement was
ignored this year. Last year the Califor
nia League was under so-called national
protection, but experience has proved that
it meant protection to the National League
and not protection to the California or
ganization. By being a party to the agree
ment attention was drawn to the players
and efforts were made to get them away
from the coast. If the California mag
nates sought protection again this sea
son they could not hope to retain sucn
men as Hughes, Doyle, Iburg, Babbitt,
Francks. Loughead, Mcllale and a few
others.
It appears singular that, although Jay
Hughes the acknowledged premier pitch
er of the United States, is the star twirler
of the Sacramento team and that ag
gregation has been greatly strength
ened, it is at the tail end of the league
procession. The Sarramentans have been
playing good ball, but they have lost us
many games as the Stocktons have won
and the farmers of the Slough City have
lost only three of the eight games played.
The standing of the teams to date is as
follows:
The Sacramentans and Oaklands are
scheduled for this week's series on the
local diamond. Jay Hughes will appear In
each of the three games and will do the
twirling on Sunday afternoon. Drennan,
who was late In joining the Oakland team,
will make his first local appearance in a
dude uniform.
The line-up for to-day is as follows:

FOR THE PROTECTION OF FORESTS.
T â ; OR the purpose of prosecuting the campaign
j of education on the subject of forest preserva
*Â¦ tion the division of forestry of the Department
of Agriculture has determined to send lecturers to
different parts of the United States to give instruc
tion on the subject and to aid in awakening a wider
and keener public interest in forestry problems. It
is stated that officials of the department will visit any
section of the United States where tree-planting or
forest protection is desired and will arrange for con
ferences of land-owners, at which explanations will be
given of the objects of the forestry division and of
the assistance it is prepared to offer to those who
wish to experiment in the work o.f cultivating and
planting trees on an extensive scale.
The decision of the officials is a good one. There*
is hardly any subject, not excepting that of good
roads, on which the people of the United States as
h. whole arc more in need of systematic higher educa
tion. The Government can hardly render a greater
service to coming generations than by teaching this
generation the folly of wasting the forests that are
as essential to a land as lungs are to a man. When
Zl wide region of country becomes treeless it soon be
comes a waste and but little better than a desert. We
are rapidly hurrying this rich and highly favored land
of ours to that condition, and the menace of floods in
wet weather and of droughts and dry river beds in
summer is yearly growing more portentous over
vast areas of the country.
An extensive campaign of education is perhaps a
necessary preliminary to the adoption of a compre
hensive scheme of forest preservation by the States
or by the National Government, and yet it is regret
table that we are still only talking on the subject,
while our neighbors in Canada have begun to act.
In the Dominion quite an elaborate plan of forest
protection has been devised, and the work of restor
ing some of the wasted pine forests of that country is
to be entered upon with vigor and at once.
In a recent report published in the New York
Tribune on the measures taken by the Canadians for
the protection of their woods it is stated that the
lumber companies of Ontario and Quebec have their
forests patrolled during the dry months of the year,
and that as a consequence the forest fires once so
common in various sections are now almost un
known in those provinces. On the tracts from whfch
all the pine has been cut new plantations have been
made, and new forests of pine are now growing tip
under the supervision of the Government, special
care being taken by forest rangers to prevent damage
to the young trees -by fire. >.
Not content with preserving forests now standing
and replanting pines where former forests were, the
Government has undertaken the work of covering
with forests the vast treeless plains of the northwest.
The Tribune's report on the subject says: "Profes
sor Macoun, the botanist of the Canadian Geological
Survey, who has made a study of this, gave it as his
opinion at a recent meeting that there should be no
insuperable difficulty in growing trees anywhere on
the prairies except on the alkaline stretches. It was
not the cold, as was popularly supposed, that pre
vented the growth of trees; the obstacles were the
prairie fires, that destroyed the trees, and the long,
dry summers that killed off the young shrubs before
they got firmly rooted. With plenty of moisture
poplar and white spruce would grow readily. A
Scotch forester suggested the black Austrian pine as
a tree that would probably be readily acclimatized in
the northwest, but Dr. SaundersV ' director of the
experimental farms, said that at the Government farm
at Brandon hundreds of these trees had been planted,
but not one.had survived the second summer. Dr.
Saunders said that the Government experiments had

There will be a surplus of $73,000.(100 of revenue in thtÂ» treasury, and still

Now that Secretary Gage, In his report, shows up a surplus of $7i\OOO.OCO by

revenue tax, in all its parts. The tax on certain articles should be removed.
Salt Lake Herald.
Waiving any question as to the need for revenue- from this source, the tax
has been made odious by its injustice. Whether it is repealed or not. its dis

that enacted it into law. It cannot be repealed too soon.

There is a very general feeling that the people should receive consideration
in this matter. They did not murmur when the war tax was Imposed; they
paid It cheerfully. But they have a right to feel that now. when that tax has

the generosity and patriotism of the nation.

THE RIGHT WAY ABOUT IT.
r-NEPRESENTATIVE WILSON ol New York
| â s has introduced a bill designed to so amend the
* war revenue act as to compel railroads, express
companies and other common carriers to pay the rev
enue taxes imposed upon their business by the'exist
ing act.but which they have hitherto managed to
shirk. According to a telegraphic summary of the
bill it provides the company shall affix and cancel at
its own expense a one-cent revenue stamp on each
bill of lading, manifest or other evidence of receipt
and forwarding of each shipment. For failure to
comply with the law a penalty of $50 in each case is
proposed, and no bill of lading, manifest or receipt
is to be valid for use in evidence unless duly stamped
as provided in the bill.
The measure has been introduced at the request of
the Merchants' Association of New York and other
commercial organizations in all parts of the Union.
It represents a widespread demand for justice. The
corporations, from whom Congress expected to re
ceive a fair share of the revenue required by the Gov
ernment to carry on the war with Spain, have per
sistently shirked payment from: the start. The mer
chants, the shippers and the public generally have
been compelled by the corporations to pay the, tax,'
and the extortion has been felt acutely Th all parts
of the Union.
The recent decision of the Supreme Court in favor
of the corporations in a suit brought to compel one
of them to pay the tax has left the people of many
States no recourse other than to amend the law in
the manner proposed by the Representative from
New York. His bill is therefore one of the most
timely and urgent now before Congress. It should
have right of way in both houses and be taken up
and enacted at this session. Each day of delay adds
to the amount of money which the tax-shirkers are
exacting from the public.
The Merchants' Association of New York is a
powerful organization, but it should not be left in this
instance to fight the battle single-handed. The con
test is one which concerns the public and is of ma
terial interest to all large shippers. It is reported
that other large commercial organizations in the East
have already given support to the New York organi
zation, and those of the Pacific Coast should
promptly unite with them. California law, as was
pointed out in The Call Thursday, affords redress
for the citizens of this State, but we should none the
less co-operate with the people of the East in the fight
for justice. The metropolis of the coast, San Fran
cisco, should lead the movement in this section, and
from each and all of her commercial and manufac
turing associations there should be sent to Washing
ton memorials urging immediate action on the Wil
son bill.
There are reasons for believing that if earnest ac
tion be taken throughout the country Congress will
adopt the desired amendment. A considerable num
ber of Congressmen arc already pledged to it. All the
California "delegation is so pledged. Let the mer
chants and the shippers now demand the fulfillment
of the pledges at this session. Corporation tax
shirking has been carried on tpo long. It is time to
stop it.

It is well for our Government to be#in a campaign
of education by lectures, but it wouljd be better to
emulate the Canadian example. The preservation of
forests is a subject in which object lessons are much
more instructive than the eloquence of words, even
if they be illustrated by transparencies.
MEN FOR THE NAVY.
SOMETHING more than the ordinary inconsis
tency of human nature is noted in the dis
patches from Washington announcing the gen
eral approval given to the bill appropriating $61,000,
000 for the navy, of which amount upward of
$28,350,000 is to be expended for the construction of
new warships, exclusive of armor and armament,
and the general indifference to every appeal that is
made for an increase of the naval forces. We have
already more war vessels than we can provide with
an adequate number of men or officers, and yet we
are about to make a large addition to the fleet with
out, it seems, making preparation for keeping in com-
It is stated by those who speak with authority that
every ship in our navy now in commission is insuffi
ciently manned: at least they have not the comple
ment of men and officers which arc assigned to Euro
pean ships of a similar class. It is stated the defi
ciency is mainly felt in the lack of officers. Accord
ing to one authority the retirement provision of the
navy personnel bill has worked so well that there are
fewer officers in the navy now than there were fifteen
years ago. Several suggestions have been made for
overcoming the dearth of trained officers, but Con
gress is slow in acting upon them.
When by one method or another we have trained
officers equal to the need of the enlarged navy, then
will come the need of seamen. An American navy
should be manned as completely as possible by
Americans. We ought to have a strong force of
skilled seamen from which to draw the men required
for our war vessels, not only in peace, but in any
sudden emergency of war. Officers can be educated
in sufficient numbers by enlarging the naval school at
Annapolis, but to train up the number of seamen re
quired we ought to have an enlarged merchant
marine, in which thousands of men would find em
ployment.
A navy is necessary to the security of commerce,
hut commerce is necessary to the upbuilding of a
navy. The vast and- mighty fleets of the empire ot
Great Britain are dependent in no small measure upon
her numerous lines of steamships and sailing vessels.
It is from the merchant marine the British navy draws
the men who man the warships! It is because she
has a large force of skilled seamen in the service of
her commerce that she is able at almost any moment
'to equip all her fleets and put them into commission
adequately officered and manned for any duty the
emergency calls for.
It matters not in what direction we undertake to in
crease our prestige upon the ocean, whether we plan
for naval or commercial supremacy and security upon
the seas, we are confronted by the need of an en
larged merchant marine. The nations of Europe un
derstand the subject well and have built up com
mercial lines as well as battleships. They have a
strong body of seamen to act as a naval reserve, and
upon that reserve much of their naval strength de
pends. The course pursued there is one of consis
tent statesmanship, while there, is inconsistency and
a lack of statesmanship at Washington displayed in
the project for constructing fleets of warships with
out providing for manning them.
WELCOME THE REGULARS.
rOR the ofneers and men of the Fourteenth In
fantry who arrived on the Sherman, the first of
the regulars to return home from the Philip
pines, San Francisco has a cordial welcome. It may
lack somewhat of the exuberant enthusiasm that
greeted the volunteers who returned while the ex
citement of the war spirit was still thrilling among
the people, but lacks nothing of sincerity, of admira
tion for the brave, nor of honor for the men who
have followed the flag and upheld the cause of the
republic amid the dangers of war.
The welcome in this case is the more earnest be
cause the people have begun to realize that in the
glow of the war feeling, when each State vied with all
others in doing honor to its volunteers, scant justice
was done to the regulars, who represented no State,
and whose service therefore would not add to the
prestige of any particular commonwealth. There was
no State pride nor local patriotism to rouse enthu
siasm for the n:en of the regular army. There was
no interchange cf courtesies between Governors and
other high ofncials when the regulars traversed State
niter State on their way to the port of embarkation.
They went to their duty without any of the thousand
marks of popular admiration showered on the Stale
troops, and their service in the field was not made the
subject of warm and continuous laudation which each
State gave to its own particular heroes while they
were at the front
It is of course natural that men who carry the State
name i:i war should be regarded by the people of that
State with more interest than those who do not carry
it, even if the latter be also natives of the same com
monwealth. That natural feeling, however, will not lead
patriots to overlook the true deserts of the regulars.
The men of the Fourteenth arc many of them native
sons of California, fomhe regiment was recruited at
Camp Merritt about two years ago, and received into
its ranks men who represent the patriotism and mili
tcry ardor of California just as truly as did those who
went to war bearing the name of the State in their
regimental title. To these men. therefore, the wel
come now given is one in which both local pride and
national patriotism arc animating motives. They
bear the name of the army of the whole country, but
they are our own boys, and their greeting will be as
cordial and as warm r.s Californians know how to

AN INEFFICIENT POLICE.
BY one method or another, and probably by
many methods, the so-called reform adminis
tration of Mayor Phelan has brought a blight
upon almost every department of the municipal gov
ernment. Evidences of inefficiency are visible well
nigh everywhere, but just now they arc most con
spicuous in the police and the detective force. Re
peated robberies and burglaries have been committed
with something like absolute impunity, for no arrests
have thus far been made of the offenders.
Recently bold attempts were made to rob the
French and the Sutro banks, and the police and the
detectives have not only been unable to catch the
criminals, but they have not even found a clew. A
murderous footpad has been plying his trade, and the
utmost the guardians of the city have done to stop
him has been to make a masquerade hunt for him
with a number of detectives disguised as women. Re
peated burglaries have been committed, and the bur
glars have hardly been disturbed in the conduct of
their trade.
Some extenuation must be made for the inefficiency
of the police on account of the unlighted streets. It
is not easy for the most vigilant of officers to note
suspicious characters or to trail them in the midnight
darkness which the reform administration has im
posed upon the 'city. The lack of street lighting,
however, does not explain all of the inefficiency of the
police and the detectives, for many of the burglaries
have been committed in the daytime, and Mayor
Phelan has not yet succeeded in obscuring the sun.
The officers cannot complain of a lack of light in
these cases, unless it be a lack of light in their own
intelligence.
The Call yesterday published a list of six bur
glaries and five attempts at burglary of recent occur
rence. Of the cases where the thieves were success
ful five took place in the daytime. Some of the
crimes were committed in the west end and some in
the southern part of the city. The crimes have now
become so frequent that no little alarm is felt in those
districts, and women are afraid to leave their houses.
This condition of affairs is discreditable to those
having charge of the police and the detective force of
the city. It is all well enough to summon the police
in considerable squads to headquarters to put them
through fancy, drills, but the record shows that the
force would be of more service to the city if the men
were' kept on their beats and a more careful guar
dianship established over the homes of the people.
Sr.n Francisco docs not expect the impossible. The
escape of some cunning burglar or sneakthief now
and then would not be a matter for which cither the
police or the detective? would be condemned, but
when all of them escape, when robbery after robbery
occurs and not a single robber is taken, when bur
glars by day and burglars by night and footpads per
petrate crime after crime and escape with impunity,
it is inevitable the people should lose confidence in
the police and the detectives. It is time for the au
thorities to bestir themselves.
No buffet should be without a bottle of Dr.
Slegert's Angostura Bitters, the South -Ameri-
can appetizer and lnvlsorator.
, At last San Francisco has an official municipal flag.
Mayor Phelan might do well to enter the^lists of es
sayists once* more and tell us what we have the flag
for any -way. ..: ? ;Â¦ ? , Â¦ ,jv-''; - 'Â¦".-' 'â¢ -

Bros, for the last five months to get into
line and either discharge their scab work
men or have them join the shipwrights"

fully ventilated before the Council last
night, with a result that a boycott was
declared, to commence on next Tuesday.

ALEXANDER DUNSMUIR'S
WILL HAS BEEN FILED
Names His Brother as Sole Devisee,
but His Widow Has Been Pro
vided For.
An authenticated copy of the will of the
late Alexander Dunsmulr, stepfather of
Edna Wallace Hopper, the well known
actress, was filed for probate yesterday.
Dunsmuir died January 31 last, leaving
an estate valued at nearly $1,000,000.
Shortly after his death it was made
known that he left a surviving wife in the
person of Mrs. Josephine Wallace Duns
mulr, whom he had secretly married.
Although their relationship was long sus
pected, their marriage was withheld from
the public until Mrs. Dunsmulr concluded",
after her husband's death, to make it
public.
In the will filed yesterday Jamea Duns
muir, decedent's brother, who resides in
Victoria. B. C, is named as sole devisee
of the estate, but in the accompanying
petition asking for the admission of the
testament to probate Mrs. Wallace-Duns
muir is named as an heir-ln-law. It is
understood that the will, which is wit
nessed by James Lowe of Sausalito, and
James P. Taylor of Oakland, named
James Dunsmuir as sole devisee, with
Mrs. Wallace-Dunsmuir's consent, her

While Driving With a Load of Lum
ber Henry Knus Falls From
His Seat
Henry Knus, driver for the J. H. Kruse
Lumber Company, was killed almost in
stantly at half-past 10 o'clock yesterday
morning by falling from the wagon seat
and being crushed under the right front
wheel.
The wagon was heavily loaded with lum
ber, and when Knus arrived at the corner
of Sixteenth and Folsom streets he turned
his horses to get out of the way of an
approaching car. As the wheels jolted
over the rails he was seen to lose his bal
ance and topple over. The wheel passed
over his chest, inflicting Injuries from
which he died in a few minutes. *
Knus lived with his family at 1377 Har
rison street and was only 24 years old. He
had been working for the lumber company
for a month, and was a sober and indus
trious man.

The northwester that has been raging
for several days back h-as played havoc
with the fleet bound from San Francisco
to ports between here and Puget Sound.
The wind jammers that left here during
the past week have yet to be heard from,
but the steamers and steam schooners tell
the tale. The collier Empire was six days
getting from San Francisco to Coos Bay,
while the steam schooner Noyo was three
days in reaching Fort Bragg, a distance
of less than 100 miles. The Scotia was
three days making Rockport and the
Cleone two days getting to Caspar. All
the vessels had a terrible time of it, and
their safe arrival yesterday was glad news
to the owners.
While the vessels bound north had a
hard time of it and could make little or
no progress, those that were southbound
simply flew along on the wings of the
nor'wester. The old schooner La Gironde
made the run from Grays Harbor to He
dondo in five days. This equals steamboat
time, and while it is not a record it is one
of the smartest runs made in many days.
She came down the coast wing and wing
and with double reefs in her mainsail.
It blew very hard on the bay yester
day, and the steam schooner Wewberg,
lying at Lombard-street wharf, caught it.
The wind and a cross sea nearly swamped
the vessel before she could be moved out
into the stream. The ferry-boat Berke
ley also suffered from the gale, being
driven against the end of her slip and do
ing considerable damage to the structure.
Movements of Transports.
The Wyefleld arrived from Manila via
Nagasaki yesterday. She is in ballast,
and brought up no passengers. The Gov
ernment nas rechartered her, and as soon
as she is released from quarantine she
will load for Manila again. There is an
urgent call for supplies and fodder from
the Philippines, and the regular transports
cannot supply the demand.
The passengers and soldiers on the
Sherman expected to be landed yesterday,
but were disappointed. Instead they were
taken to the quarantine station and fumi
gated. The boys of the Fourteenth In
fantry will be landed at the Presidio
wharf and will be escorted to their quar
ters by the cavalry now stationed there.
The hospital ship Missouri has been con
demned by the inspectors and the Gov
ernment has appropriated $40,000 to turn
her into a freight transport. The work of
transformation will be rushed, as the ves
sel is wanted badly by the commissariat
department of the transport service.
Water Front Notes.
Charles E. Bondrow of the firm of
Mighell & Bondrow met with a serious
accident on the ship May Flint yesterday.
He was inspecting the vessel, and in step
ping from one point to another lost his
balance and fell a considerable distance.
He was hurried to the Harbor Hospital,
where Dr. McGettigan found that he was
suffering from severe contusions of the
right side, chest and right knee. Later
Mr. Bondrow was taken to his home in
Berkeley.
The hoodlum Kangr that Infested the
ferry steamers last year has begun opera
tions again. Between 5 and 6 o'clock p. m.
they annoy and molest the passengers on
the lower decks, the deckhands being
powerless to prevent them. Captain Dun
leavy detailed ofllcers last season to travel
on the steamers and a number of arresta
followed. The same course is to be re
sumed.
The steamer Manauense Is on the dry
riock pettinp an overhauling. To-day shÂ«
will po to Steuart-street wharf and begin
loading for Kahulul.

SCOTT RETAINS
HIS SEAT IN
THE SENATE
Only Three Votes Against
the West Virginia
Member.
Chandler Gives Notice That He Will
on Wednesday Call Up the
Case of Clark of
Montana.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â The Senate
to-day voted upon the resolution declar
ing Nathan li. Srott to be entitled to
his seat in the Senate from West Vir
ginia. ThÂ» motion of Pettus that the re
port and resolution be recommitted to the
committee for full investigation was de
feated without division. The resolution
of the comittee declaring that Scott
â¢was entitled to retain his seat in the Sen
ate was then adopted. 52 to 3, the votes
in the negative being cast by Morgan,
Pettus and Turner.
Chandler gave notice that on next Wed
nesday, he would ask the Senate to take
up thf> rape of Senator Clark of Mon
tana, adding that if no one should desire
to epeak in opposition to the report of the
committee, he would have nothing to say
in support of it. Allen expressed the
hope that the Senate would not be asked
to act upon this case until the Senators
would have an opportunity to read the
testimony. In view of the fact that the
committee had taken two or three months
to investigate the subject he did not con
sider it fair that the Senate should be
asked to cMsDOse of the matter within
two or three days' notice. Such a re
quest was ridiculous in any tribunal.
Char-dler replied that he had no desire
to preps consideration of the cafie unduly
and while he did not withdraw his notice,
to cail the case up on Wednesday, he said
there would be no disposition to press
the resolution In a way to Impair the
rights of any one. The caÂ»e could be
postponed if euch disposition was thought
Lett. Thlfl explanation of the attitude of
the chairman of the Committee on Elec
tion* appeared to be satisfactory and the
Senate took up the Alaskan bill.

HOUSE BREAKS A RECORD.
Ninety-One Private Pension Bills
Passed in One Day.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â The House
broke all records to-day by passing ninety
one pension bills. Among them was one to
pension at the rate of $40 per month the
widow of the late Colonel John M. Stotz
enberg of the First Nebraska, who was
killed in the Philippines. The conference
rr-port on the Hawaiian Government bill
was adopted and now goes to the Presi
dent.
Loud of California arose to a question
of personal privilege and complained that
in connection with the debate on the post
office appropriation bill yesterday Fitz
gerald of Massachusetts had injected into
the record words not spoken in debate
which reflected upon him (Loud). He
complained that Fitzgerald had persist
ently misrepresented him on other occa
sions. Some of his characterizations â¢of
Fitzgerald were personal and severe.
The Massachusetts member made a spir
ited rejoinder, stating that he' had exer
cised the usv'al privilege of revising his
remarks.
The matter was disposed of when at the
request of Fitzgerald the matter objected
to by Loud was stricken out.
M'KINLEY AND MILES.
Proposed Ticket Advocated by Lead
ing Republicans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â 1n view of
the announcement made by Governor
Roosevelt that he will not become a Vice
Presidential candidate and of the prospect
that a naval hero may be at the head or
the tail of the Democratic ticket, promi
nent Republican politicians are consider
ing Major General Nelson A. Miles as a
running mate for McKinley. Senator
Warren of Wyoming called attention to
day to an undercurrent in his favor
among Senators. Major General Miles,
when asked this afternoon if he were
willing to become Vice Presidential can
didate, replied that he must be put down
as non-commitaJ.
"I'm not talking politics now," he said.
His reticence is not taken as an indica
tion that he would refuse the nomination.

INDICTED FOR
THE KIDNAPING
OF KIM QUET
True Bills Returned by
Saata Clara Grand
Jury.
Persons Who Must Stand Trial Are
Deputy Constable Harris, Jus
tice Dyer and Wong
Ling Ding.
?
Ereeial Dispatch to The Call.
BAN JOSE, April 27.â Active prosecution
against the participants in the Palo Alto
kidnaping case was launched this morn
ing by the Grand Jury returning indict
ments against Deputy Constable Tom
Harris, Justice Dyer of Palo Alto, Wong
Ling Ding, who subsequently; married the
girl, and Wong Fong. The charge is kid
naping.
The Grand Jury has been invesigating
tho matter for the past two weeks and
was greatly aid'-d by the Palo Alto com
mittee and District Attorney Campbell.
Many witnesses were called, including two
young ladies who were supposed to be
with Htrrington at the time of the out
rage perpetrat.-d <*i Miss Cameron and the
Chinese girl, but they strenuously denied
they were the parties.
Deputy Constable Harris was arrested
this morning and taken before Judge L#or-'
igan. He gave bonds in the sum of $3000
for his attendance in court, and his ar
raignment was set for next Wednesday.
Justice Dyer is In. Palo Alto and will give
bonds. Wong Fong, one of the Chinese
indicted, is In the County Jail awaiting
trial on the charge of abduction preferred
at Mayiield, but the whereabouts of Wong
lAng Ding is not known.
No charges were returned against At
torney 15. A. Herrington and Watchman
Dunsmoor of I'alo Alto, although the' mat
ter was Investigated. It Is said Herring
ton's political "pull" helped to save him.
This afternoon a warrant charging Her
rington with kidnaping was issued in Jus
tice Van Buren's court at Maytteld, and
he- at once left for there to give bonds.
This warrant is said to be the result of
the failure of the Grand Jury to act. The
prosecution of all the participants in the
kidnaping of Kirn Quey will be actively
pushed by the ccmmiitte in charge of the
matter. It is lelieved there is sufficient
evidence to convict all of them.
It is reported that the committee has
evidence that two weeks before the kid
naping Herrington approached two pri
vate detectives in this city and asked
them to .take part in the outrage. He
was willing to take them in as equal part
ners and divide the proceeds. He told
them the Chinese owed him $275 and they
would get this, besides which the woman
could be subsequently sold for $700 or $800,
and they would get a good rake oft on the
price.
The Grand Jury also returned another
indictment against Attorney Samuel B.
Tcrrill, who is nov. in jail awaiting trial
on some half-dozen other indictments. The
charge is forgery. It found that on April
2s. 1897. Terrill secured $2GO from Eddie
15unny of Xew Almaden by means of a
note to which he had forged the name of
R. J. Mclntyre. It is alleged no such per
son as Mclntyre exists.

whose duties are to meet passengers arriving
in Jersey City and New York over the Penn-
sylvania Lines and assist them in arranging
for trans-AÂ»lantlc trips via any of the steam-
ship lines by conducting them to steamships
and aiding in preparations for a trip abroad.
These agents will provide cabs operated by
the Pennsylvania System and aid passengers
with their baggage They are fully posted on
matters pertaining to steamships leaving New
York, and arrangements can be made through
them for procuring steamship tickets In ad-
vance.
They also meet Incoming steamships to aid
travelers In shaping details for continuing
Journeys from New York over the Pennsyl-
vania Lines by furnishing tickets, arranging
for the. transfer of baggage from steamship
docks after It has been passed by customs In-
spectors, ahd having the sam,e checked through

REVENUE CUTTER WILL
PURSUE THE ALPHA
Officers Instructed to Seize Her if
She Attempts to Land at
Nome.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C., April 27.â Two
United States revenue officers left this
afternoon for the north by the steamer
Cottage City. They will land at Sitka,
and have orders to take whichever of
Uncle Sam's revenue cutters that hap
pens to be in port for as quick a trip
as can be made to Cape Nome. They are
after the Canadian steamer Alpha, which
is expected to attempt to land freight
and passengers at Cape Nome, in viola
tion of the United States customs laws.
These provide that no foreign vessel may
land freight at other than a subport of
entry. The orders of the officials who
left to-day are to seize tho Alpha and
bring her back to Seattle, passengers and
all, if she tries to land at Nome.
The Alpha cleared from here, ostensibly
for St. Michael, but that was simply a
blind. Her captain expected to land at
Nome without any interference. The
Alpha's going to St. Michael is practi
cally out of the question, for the ice
will not be out of the mouth of the Yu
kon until June 15, and if she were caught
in the ice floe she would be more apt
to be carried to the coast of Siberia .than
anywhere else. '
, The Alpha has 300 American passengers
on board. She is an old boat, and the
fares taKen were three times her value.
It is said that the captain will run her
UDon the beach for eood if he has trouble
about landing. The owners of the steam
er here say that they have a permit from
Washington to pail their vessel from Se
attle hereafter without changing her reg
istry.

lows:
I have been deeply touched by the numerous

idential escape of the Princess of Wales and
myself from the danrer we have lately passed
through. From every quarter of the Rlobe,
from the Queen's subjects throughout the world
as well as from representatives and Inhabitants
of foreign countries have these manifestations
proceeded, and on my return to this country I
received a welcome so spontaneous and hearty
that I felt I was the recipient of the most
gratifying tribute of genuine good will. Such
a proof of kind and generous feeling Is.
naturally, most highly prized by me and will
be forever cherished In my memory.

Works Quit Work.
PITTSBURG, April 27.â Two hundred
boys employed at the pressed steel car
works In Allegheny, who struck yester
day for an increase in wages, with several
hundred companions assembled near the

ficers have been placed about the com
pany's property, and this afternoon every
thing was, quiet, the strikers having beÂ«n
dispersed.

THE SPRING MEDICINE
gives new life and substance to the nerve and
muscie tissues, restores strength and
vitality to the human system.
Care and constant strain of work has first effect upon
the nerves. Without strong nerves the stomach, liver
and kidneys are weakened, the blood is impoverished,
the energy of the body is wasted and disease is liable-
GEORGE H. GRAVES, La Crosse, Wis., writes:
"Paine's Celery Compound is the greatest spring medicine on the face of
this earth. I am taking it this spring with even better results than ever before.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 28, 1900.
HAS NOT HEARD
OF EXCLUSION
OF FRESH HEAT
German Foreign Office Be
lieves the Newspapers
JbrrecL
Asserts That It Would Have Been
Notified at Once Had Prince
Hohenlohe Taken Such.
Action.
Â»
BERLIN, April 27.â The German For-
elgn Office has no information regarding:
the alleged order of Prince Hohenlohe to
the North German Lloyd Steamship Com
pany forbidding the company, under ar
ticle 26 of the subvention contract, to
make further importations of and to land
in German, Dutch or Belgian ports fresh
ly slaughtered meats, butter, dairy prod
ucts or cereals. The Foreign Office dis
credits the story. United States Embasi
sador White says he has heard nothing
regarding the matter except what has ap
peared in the German press and he be
lieves that he would have been immediate
ly informed had any such order been is
sued. For this reason he disbelieves the
statement of the Vorwaerts and the Nu
remberg Tage Post.
To-day Mr. White called upon Count
Bulow, the Foreign Secretary, and hand
ed him a copy of United States Consul
General Mason's report upon the exports
to the United States during the last quar
ter. Count yon Bulow was much interest
ed in noting the large increase. To-mor
row Mr. White wlllycall upon him again
and lay before him proof that American
exports to Germany consist very largely
of commodities Indispensable to Germans.
DOUBT THAT GERMANY
HAS EXCLUDED MEATS
State Department Officials Not "Will
ing to Accept the Berlin Story
as True.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â Not having
had any sort of official notice of an in
tention on the part of the German Gov
ernment to add to the difficulties of the
negotiations respecting the admission of
;i.merican meat products into Germany by
the issue of an order excluding freshly
slaughtered meats and dairy products,
the State Department; officials are unwill
ing to accept as accurate the statement
attributed to some of the German news
papers to the effect that the North Ger
man Lloyd Steamship Company had been
enjoined not to bring such products to
German ports.
But even if such an order has been
made, while it undoubtedly would tend to
accentuate the growing feeling in the
United States over the repeated attacks
on American commerce, it is realized
that the German Government has, legally
speaking, an undoubted right to deal at
its pleasure with a corporation of its own
creation, such as this steamship company.
Were the same rule attempted to be ap
plied to other than German vessels, and
especially to vessels under the American
flag, the case would take on a very dif
ferent aspect, as there would be an op
portunity for the exercise of some very
vigorous diplomacy.
As it is, the impression here is that the
principal sufferer from such an order
would be the German steamship com
pany, for so long as American meats are
not absolutely excluded from Germany
they find their way across the ocean in
vessels of other nationalities.
NOT MEANT FOR AMERICA.
Exclusion Order Pertains to Chinese
and Australian Products.
NEW YORK, April 27.â Gustave H.
Schwab, manager of the North German
Lloyd line American agency, said to-day
in reference to the action of Prince yon
Hohenlohe in interdicting the Importation
into Germany or Dutch or Belgian ports
of pork and other products' by the com
pany that the edict did not apply to Amer
ican provisions. The ruling applied to the
importations from China and Australia, as
the steamships of the North German
Lloyd line plying to those countries are
Buosldized by the German Government,
while those running to the United States
are not subsidized.

PLANS TO SELL WATER
T0 THREE OTHER CITIES
Public Utilities Committee Will In
vite Oakland, Sacramento and
Stockton to Inspect Tahoe.
The Supervisors' Committee on Public
Utilities decided last night to invite the
Mayors of Sacramento, Oakland and
Stockton to join in the Inspection of the
Lake Tahoe water system on June 8 next.
It was deemed advisable to take this
course because it has been practically
agreed. that the proposition to supply this
city from that source will be accepted
when the time is ripe for the acquisition
of a municipal water system. It will be
possible to dispose of some of the supply
to the three cities named.
Commissioner Manson of the Board of
Public Works said there were at least six
supplies that could be favorably consid
eredâSpring Valley, Lake Tahoe; Yuba
River, Blue Lakes and the north Fork of
the American River. , Â¦
El Campo.
I-ast Sunday, when the wind proved so
disagreeable in the city, there was hardly
a breath of air stirring at El Campo
across the bay. About: fifteen hundred
were scattered about the place, making
hardly a noticeable showing In the com
modious grounds. There is music with
dancing and a good time generally, every
Sunday. <â¢ J
Fire Department Horseshoeing.
A notice was served on Auditor Wells
yesterday by Attorney Choynski request
ing that he refuse to audit any bills for
horseshoeing or supplies incurred by the
Fire Commission unless the charter pro
vision that all contracts for supplies shall
be let to the lowest responsible bidder be
obeyed. Choynski claims that the
commission has favored one horse-
Bhoer for some time, but Jhat It
had decided to divide the work
among five horseshoers in the future. The
Auditor states that the charter must be
obeyed or he will not sign the bills for
supplies or shorseshoeing.
POSTUM CEREAL.
HARD TO BELIEVE.
Effects cf Coffee on Human Beings.
"Every time that I indulged, even in
a weak cup of col Tec, I suffered with a
i terrible headache and disordered stom-
I ach. Ten months ago I quit coffee al-
1 together and took up Postum Food
I Coffee. 1 have no tnore headaches; am
very much stronger and in better fl^sh
thzn I was before I bejjan. I ca*n work-
hard a!! day without feeling tired at all.
"Before 1 drank Postum I got so tired
at my work that I had to lie down in
the afternoon. Occasionally I would
fair.t away. A !ady friend, an author,
she would not be without Postum
Food Coffee for anything in the world.
She uses it three times a day and says
i: keeps her mind clear and bright and
her body healthy.
'Another friend, a lady who is a crip-
7<!e and has been an invalid for a long
while, took up Postum Coffee about
two years ago. She has gained many
pounds, and her flesh is now hard and
firm. It is natural we should sing the
praises of Postum." Miss Ida M. For-
ney, 24 Highland avenue, Melrose
Highlands, Mass.
It will be observed from the above
fhat each person shoivcd an increase in
sturdy strength, brought about by leav-
ng off coffee and the use of Postum
7ood Coffee. The reason for this ex*
jcricnce is that the poisonous alkaloids
:ont2ined in regular coffee prostrated
r he nervous system, bringing on all
sorts of aches and ails, and disintegrat-
ing the dedicate cells in the nerve cen-
ters, destroying and throwing out the
elements absolutely required by Nature
for maintaining good, sound nervous
strength and health.
When coffee is discontinued. Nature
seeks to set i:p a healing and repair the
damage. The efforts of Nature arc
powerfully aided by certain elements in
Postum Food Coffee which come from
parts of the field grain, selected espe-
cially for the purpose by the makers
of Po?tum. One of the principal
elements is phosphate of potash â a
delicate, microscopic product used by
the system in combination with albu-
men 01" the food to m.il:c up the cells in
the nerve centers of the human body.
There :s a well defined reason why peo-
ple can add greatly to their strength
?nd health by leaving off coffee and
t:<=ing Postum Food Coffee. :

Having Been Missed for
Three Days.
Mrs. Mattle Colburn, a married woman,
was found dead yesterday in her rooms

Such Is Braslan's Defense to His
Wife's Divorce Suitâ Other
Actions Filed.
The artion by which Georgia M. Bras
lan seeks to necure a decree of divorce
from her husband, Charles Braslan, of
San Jose, was partly - heard by Judge
Troutt yesterday morning. Mrs. Bras
lan alleges desertion and failure to pro
vide.
After informing the court that she mar
ried her husband in Minneapolis, in IS9I,
Mrs. Braslan told a detailed story of their
life together up to October 4, 1899, at
which time, she alleges, her husband cast
her off and compelled her to return to her
relatives in the East. In April of this
year she returned to San Jose and took
up her residence in the St. James Hotel,
where she still resides.
Mr. Braslan took the stand in his own
behalf and told quite a different story.
He said th3Vhe did not want his wife to
go Kast in October of lapt year, as he was
unable to stand tho expense. She in
sisted on taking the journey, however, he
said, and then he took her to the' train,
gave her KO and bade her good-by for
ever. Subsequently he went East and
said that his wife, tried to pee him in
New York and Chicago, but he avoided
her. Since her return he has honored
her bills at the St. James and signified
his willingness to support her fn the fu
ture. Judge Troutt said that in his opin
ion the case was one to be settled out
of court, and allowed the case to go over
for one week.
Judge Troutt made an order yesterday
annulling the marriage of Daniel C Rob
ertson to Bertha E. Robertson. The
court found that statutory grounds for
the annullment of the marriage existed
and granted the plaintiff's prayer.
Catherine M. Keating was granted a
divorce from John P. Keating yesterday
on statutory' grounds.
Suits for divorce have been filed by
Frank Egan against Kate E. Egan, for
intemperance, Grace E. Hays against
Ira C. Hays for desertion. Joseph Rhein
gold against Sime Rheingold for cruelty,
and Annie De Vries against George De
Vries for intemperance.
KILPATRICK'S SUSPENSION
TO BE RECONSIDERED
Superintendent Webster Will Not
Obey the School Board's Orders
Begarding Principal.
The Board of Education will meet this
morning to reconsider the suspension of
Principal E. C. Kilpatrick. The board
adopted resolutions at its last meeting
directing Superintendent Webster to sus
pend Kilpatrick from duty, but Webster
has refused to do so, claiming that the
board alone has power to suspend or dis
miss teachers. Kilpatrlck's attorneys
have served a writ of prohibition re
straining the Superintendent from sus
pending him pending the final settlement
of his suit against the last board.
Superintendent Webster made an.inves
tigation yesterday of the case of Miss E.
J. McGreeny, who was ordered suspended
for habitual absence. The teacher has
presented a certificate from a physician
stating that she has been very ill for
some time past. She ascribes the fact
that her absence was not reported to the
negligence of her relatives. Webster will
report on the subject at next* week's
meeting.

When her sister married and her broth
ers finished their college course Margaret
Juller then 34. accepted an invitation
fom Horace Greeley to come to New
Tiork as literary critic for the Tribune.
Her spirited sketches Instantly became
marked features of the paper giving a
pronounced impulse to the uplifting of art
literature and life. In this, her last liter
ary work In America, she combined the in
sight of the novelist, the analytic spirit of
the critic and the Joyou3, prophetic fear
lessness of the poet.
Iq twenty months she ha,l earned
enough to indulge her long-cherished
plans of studying abroad. In England
and France she was warmly welcomed by
the most distinguished writers and think
ers, but Rome was her Mecca, and thither
she hastened, quickly making warm
friendships there with Mrs. Jameson.
Powers. Greenough, the Brownings and
the Storys.
"Within the next four years was com
pressed the greatest development of her
life, with its tragic denouement. Stray
ing through St. Peter's one day she be
came separated from her friends and was
obliged to accept the escort of a yountc
Italian, Angelo. Marquis of Ossr.il. who
courteously conducted her home. The ac
quaintance thus romantically initiated de
veloped Into a warm friendship, which
speedily terminated in marriage. Owing
to Rome's critical political condition it
was necessary to keep secret the fact that
the young Italian nobleman had married
an impecunious Protestant.
Margaret meanwhile, through her
friendship with Mazzini, had thrown her
self heart and soul into the Italian strug
gle, and while Ossoli as captain in the
civic guard was stationed with his com
mand on the wall of the Vatican sho
nursed the wounded in the military hos
pital. Her sympathy and care for each
one's particular taste won for her the de
votion of the soldiers, who as she passed
through the wards raised themselves on
their elbows to get a last glimpse of her
departing figure. Meanwhile she was haiw
rowed to death by threats of desertion
from her baby's nurse, and she lay awaka
night after night trying to devise ways of
passing out from the invested city to
quiet the wailing cry that was always icj
her ears. Her husband, too. during th*
siege of Rome was exposed to the great
est danger, and refusing to leave his post
either for food or rest was dependent upon
the provisions which Margaret could send
him.
After ten days' resistance Rome wasi
obliged to surrender to the French, and
the short-lived republic came to an end.
Greatly as Margaret deplored Us downfall
she was thankful to rush through the open
gates to Rletl. where she found tho Httlo
Angelo reduced to a skeleton and dying
of neglect. While nursing him back to lifts
she was loined by her husband. The down
fall of the liberal party deprived Ossoll
of hlÂ« rank and fortune, and although
Margaret's friends were most generous
In their offer of help and sympathy life
became so painful to them in Italy thai \Z
seemed best to return to America. wherÂ»
Margaret was anxious to publish her
newly written book on the Roman repub
lic. To save expense they embarked on a
two months' voyage in a sailing vessel.
Shortly after they were out of sight of
land smallpox broke out among the sail
ors, and the captain died of the dread
disease. Margaret nursed all faithfully,
but felt greatly depressed when the baby
Angelo succumbed to the infection. Great
care brought him a second time back to
life, and the vessel at last came In sight
of Long Island. The following morning
they expected to land in New "York, but a
gale came up in the night and the vessel
was wrecked. But few of the passengers
were saved. Margaret refused any effort
at rescue that would separate her from
her devoted husband and baby, and they
were all drowned together. Those who
loved her were inconsolable at her tragic
death and those who knew how she had
filled her life with charities and stored
her mind with knowledge, and what an
inspiration for good had been the use of
her powers, deplored her loss to humanity.
The literary world never knew her as the
Marchioness Opfoll. for her book upon the
ephemeral Roman republic perished with
her.
"soon her wit had effaced the Impression
of her personal unattractiveness. and the
eyes, which were so plain at first, swam
with fun and drolleries, and the very tides
of joy and superabundant life. â¢ â¢ â¢ Her
satire was only the pastime and necessity
of her talent. Her plane of character
rose constantly In my estimation, disclos
ing many moods and powers In successive
platforms or terraces, each above each."
Horace Greeley, while admiring her epi
grammatic terseness and literary finish,
nevertheless felt predetermined not to
like her. and avoided her even after he
had Invited her into his own household,
but he soon acknowledged that her ir
resistible individuality had vanquished
his prejudice. Carlyle, the cross-grained,
wrote to Emerson of her books as "un
deniable utterances of a truly heroic
mind, altogether unique, so far as I know,
among the writing women of this genera
tion; rare enough, too, God knows, among
Â¦ the writing men. â¢ â¢ â¢ Honor to Mar
garet, and more and more good speed
to her." Poe considered her literary style
the best that he knew; and it was Mar
garet Fuller who introduced Robert
Browning to the enthusiasm of American
readers. Although Emerson, Clarke,
Channlng, Higginson and Harriet Beecher
Stowe have written her biography, after
all her truest biography is yet to be com
piled from the diaries, letters and memo
randa of the most distinguished persons
of her day, their scattered sentences .tes
tifying to the sense of personal uplift,
stimulus or illumination exercised
throughout her concentrated life.
To her father, Timothy Fuller, a schol
arly but impecunious lawyer, Margaret
was indebted for the broad development
of her precocious powers, which he ex
panded prematurely at the expense of her
health. Determined that Margaret, his
oldest child, should enjoy the same ed
ucational privileges as her brother?, he
decided to give her himself the ad
vantages of the college course then denied
to women. To this end he made great
personal sacrifices, teaching the child
after the exhaustion of his day's work
and never realizing that this late over
tension was sapping the nervous strength
of the little 6-year-old. Soon nightmare
and sleep-walking sounded their unavail
ing warning, and it is therefore not sur
prising that a few years later the over
taxed child-life lay hovering between life
and death. The stern, remorseful father,
realizing at last the slender thread from
which her life was suspended, came to her
bedside and said: "My dear, I have been
thinking of you in the night and I can
not remember that you have any faults.
You have defects, of course, as all mor
tals have, but I do not know that you
have a single fault."
The student will readily appreciate that
â¢ the abnormal child mind was there, and
would have ultimately asserted itself
without parental forcing, when he learns
that Margaret Fuller read Latin at 6 be
fore she could read English; that she
wrote a Latin poem at 8, read Tasso and
Ariosto in the original at 10 and in three
months mastered the German language so
that she could read with ease Korner.
Richter. Schiller and Goethe's "Faust" and
"Iphlgenia." Greek and music and a
devouring love of reading filled in the in
terstices. Shakespeare. Cervantes and
Moliere were her favorites before she was
10, and in her teens she supplemented them
with exhaustive study of Mme. de Stael.
Epictetus, Milton, Racine, the Castillan
ballads and the elder Italian poets, Berni
Pulci and Politian. Delving thus into the
deepest thought of many nationalities, she
enriched her English writing, expressed
herself with flexibility and felicity and be
came the acknowledged beat translator
of her day.
While Margaret Fuller was recovering
from her critical Illness her father sud
denly sickened with cholera and died. Re
linquishing at once a long-cherished plan
of returning home with Harriet Marti
neau, Margaret resolved to take her
father's place as head of the family and to
carry out his intention of sending her
brothers through college. S Although a
mere girl, she rented a house upon her
own responsibility and supported the fam
ily, supplementing her teaching by writ
ing translations and original sketches.
After teaching French and Latin in Bron
son Algott's famous school she taught two
years in Providence, carrying with her a
most appreciative estimate from Mr Al
cott. "I think her," he wrote, "the most
brilliant talker of the day. She has a
quick and comprehensive wit. a firm com
mand of her thoughts and a speech to win
the most cultivated."
Breaking down in health, the overtaxed
woman returned to Boston and at the
earnest solicitation of her friends began a
series of parlor lectures, known as the
far-fanied Fuller conversations. At these.

The uncertainty hanging over the fate
of the "St. Mary's Park fund" has In a
measure been settled by an opinion just
handed the Board of Supervisors by Dis
trict Attorney Lane. In that opinion the
District Attorney declares that the $125,000
set aside by the last Board of Supervisors
for the purchase of the park; cannot be
diverted for any other purpose.
The St. Mary's Square Association Is
very much elated over this victory and
has adopted the following resolution:
District Attorney Lane's opinion was as
follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, April ID, 1900. %
Gentlemen: In answer to your in
quiry as to whether or not the $123,
000 set aside by the last Board of
Supervisors for the purpose of ac
quiring "St. Mary's Park" proper
ties may be diverted, I am of opin
ion that the said sum is protected
against such diversion by ."Ration
2, chapter 11, article 111, and I^sec
tion 37 of article XVI of the char
ter, and by section 4 of the statute
of March 19. ISS9 (Statutes ISS9, p.
361), under which the lands referred
to are to be acquired, if at all. The
$125,000 under consideration was, in
my judgment, "raised" for the pur
pose of purchasing this property,
and not for general expenses. (See
section 2. chapter 11, article 111,
above cited.) It constitutes a fund
authorized by law, which "must be
continued in the treasury until the
necessity â¢ for its continuance
ceases." (See section 37, article XVI,
above cited.) And it is the result of
a tax levy made with the object of
acquiring this property, "and the
revenue so obtained shall be ap
plied to no other use or purpose."
(See section 4. Statutes ISS9, above
cited.) Respectfully yours.

gatherings, which continued during flra
years, Margaret Fuller was at her best,
and exerted an extraordinary Influence
over this circle, which gratefully acknowl
edged h*r its ruling spirit. Her greatest
talent lay in oratory, and many of those
admitted to these unique conversations
felt that her eloquence was equaled only
by that of Wendell Phillips. She needed
to be tired by touch with other minds;
then her mind struck forth sparks, co
pious, epigrammatic, paradoxical, thought
ful, pungent, always and ever sympa
thetic and charming. She herself recog

into the recreative land 3 of music and
art. Very early, she said, she had realized
that the great aim of her life was to grow,
and growth consequently became the
watchword of her constituency. Nobody's
explanations ever perplexed her brain, and
she ably held her own with Emerson and
the most thoughtful men of her time who
later joined her evening conversational
classes.
About this time Emerson. Charming: and
others had started a literary-philosophical

Margaret Fuller was able managing editor

XL SARAH MARGARET FTTLLER
OSSOLI.
(ISIO-1530.)
BY CHARLOTTE BREWSTER JORDAN
The genius of Margaret Fuller flashed
cometlike across the literary heavens of
the early nineteenth century, and just as
mankind awoke to Its rapid brilliancy and
striking concentration of light It shot
past into the darkness again, leaving but
a vivid memory in the minds of those who
had been privileged to notice its course.
Behind this genius was a womanly per
sonality, a stimulating charm which in
fluenced her idolizing circle of friends to
set their faces like flint against obstacles
to success and to push on like her toward
a definite goal. Without money and in
her youth extremely unprepossessing In
appearance, she nevertheless by sheer
force of personal magnetism Influenced or
directed the thought of her day.
In his "Fables for Critics" Lowell, who
felt his budding genius unapreciated by
this versatile woman, refers quizzically to
her whimsical self-esteem in' the following
lines:
"For a woman must surely see well,
If she try, â¢
The whole of whose being's a capital I."
.Emerson, at first repelled by her un
pleasant voice, promptly admitted that

HAZE DID NOT
DIE THE DEATH
OF A TRAITOR
Father Gleason Denies Story
of Corporal Accused of
Desertion.
Two Sailors on Hospital Ship Relief
Met the Soldier While All Three
Were Prisoners of Insur
gents.
From fnr off Manila comes the contra
diction of a story which received exten
sive circulation in March of last year to
the effect that ex-Corroral Henry F.
Haze cf the First California Vol
unteers, who was branded as a traitor
Â£rd deserter, had met a terrible death
while serving the Fliplnos as a lieutenant.
t a.ther Joseph M. Glrason. formerly of
Bt. Rose's Church, who has been in the
PhUirplnes since last September, doing
miesor.ary work among the United State 3
troops, has written to a brother clergy
man in this city flatly contradicting: the
ttory of Haze's desertion and asking that
In justice to the memory of the man, who
died under far different circumstances, the
real laets of the case be made public.
A letter was received in this cttv en
February 13. IK>9. which contained an ar
ticle published in the American, a Manila
daily paper, telling of Haze's alleged de
fcrticri. though the r.amu was printed in
correctly as John W. Hayes. It stated
that Hayes had married a .FiJir-ino woman
and two days later deserted to the insur
gent forces. It was learned here that
there was no soldier in the regiment by
:!:e name of John \V. Hayes, but that
Henry V. Haze had gone to Manila as a
corporal.
In his letter Father Gleason speaks of
the dead soldier as '"Hayes" and attests
to the fact Â¦ from the undisputed testi
mor.y of two mÂ«^n th.it h*> dia not desert.
but had been taken prisoner. Following
is the portion of Father Gleason's letter:
"Perhaps you will remember a man
r.amed Hayes of the First California, wno
u:-.s fald to have deserted last year
end joined the in<urrectos, obtaining a
cnramiPÃlon as a reward. You will re
jr.ember. too. that a fcody was found after
a certain engagement badly mutilated ano

It now aj pears, according to the story of
two members of tre <*rew of the hospital

who were seized by the insurgents as they
reared Malate in a small boat, that the
Btory about Hayes is a fabrication pure
and simple. Hoppe and Bl&nford escaped
after nine months' imprisonment and told
me that they met Hayes and were with
him at the time of his death, whicd was
quite iifTercnt from that described in ill's
papers.
â¢'Whon the First California Volunteers
were at San Pedro Macate, Hayes swam
tcrot-s the river, and not being in uni
form was arrested by the insurgents as a

Bradstreet's on Trade.
NEW TORK, April 27.â Bradstreefe to-mor
row will say: Evidences of the fact that there
are now two sides of the general trade situa
tion where for a year past there was but one
come to sight each week. Different sections ot
the country and lines of business return dif
ferent reports, but that the situation as a
whole is a favorable^one and suffers merely by
comparison with the enormous and almost
feverish activity of some time ago In also evi
dent. Excluding the great speculative centers,
the aggregate of business Is undoubtedly larger
than a year ago, and the business done even
in several Industries reporting reduced activity
would seem very large even to those bearlshly
Inclined had It not been for the enormous ag
gregate done some short time ago. Crop pros
pects, except In the wheat area of the central
West, and In some flooded sections of the South,
remain all that might be wished for. Retail
demand Is Improving and nothing of a definite
ly depresBlnc character has yet developed.
In the abrupt readjustment of steel and wire
prices the. Iron and steel Industries received a
notable shock, but have stood the ordeal very
well, confirming earlier advices of the substan
tial and non-speculative basis for the Immediate
activity and greatly advanced prices of the past
year.
The possibilities of a renewed export trade In
pig Iron have constituted one of the foremost
supports of that Industry. Last week's reports
of heavy sales of Southern Iron for export are
amply confirmed, and an enormously larger ton
nage could be placed If freight rates and room
were favorable. Hardware Is In Increased dis
tribution at the West, but rather quiet in East
ern markets. Among other materials copper Is
firm, while tin Is rather weaker.
One of the most favorably situated industries
is that of shoes. Manufacturers are .reported
active. Jobbers are busy and seasonable weather
is inducing a good distribution from retail
hand*.
Paints, oils and drugs are also in good dlstri-
AYu- York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 27.â Yesterday's show of
strength In stocks was dissipated in the course
of to-day's trading on the exchange. Ths mar
ket opened quite generally higher and an at
tempt was made to ccr.tinue the upward rush
In Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio. It
was very soon found, however, that the gen
eral demar.<i for stocks was quite Insignificant,
although at a higher level ot prices, yester
day's operations having so far diminished the
short Interest that demand from that source
was no longer an effective support. In Irugar
especially ysteniay's urgent demand from the
ehorts decidedly relaxed. The price was run
up after the opening to 119\, but the realizing
sales from buyers Â«jn the recent advance over
powered the Ftock. It got back once again
above lapt right's close and then fell an ex
treme C\. with a feverish and uncertain rally.
There was some substance of authentic news
concerning the stock as on the advance and
It* movement wai< due entirely to technical
oaUÃes. The same was true of the general
market. The reaction was due to the general
recojrnilicn that yesterday's sharp advance was
due to a deman.l from over-extended short in
terest. Some eJTcit was made to combat the
reaction bidding up different stocks. There was
a chow of strength at different periods In the
Tobacco stock*, the Leather stocks, Brooklyn
Transit and New York Central, but these
maneuvers provwj unavailing to hold the mar
ket. The opening atrenpth was due In no small
part to the buying for London account, which
amounted to 23.000 or 30.000 shares. The rail
road earnings reported for the day were on
the Bide of reaction. St. Paul's net earnings
lor March fell off by reason of the high level
of operating expenses. The statements cf the
Heading Company and New Jersey Central for
the name i>eriod were distinctly weak. Fol
lowing the Ontario and Western statement of
}-es-t<?rday the reactionary tendency in the an
thracite group is sufficiently explained. The
jjrg.iafoility of a favorable bank statement to
morrow failed to help the market. The gains
in cash from Interior source* are expected to
Show an increase of nearly $2,000,000 over last
week's gain from the same source, but on the
otter hand the gains from the sub-treasury
by the banks have fallen off almost as much
from last week. On yesterday's operations the
banks lo6t to the sub-treasury some $338,000,
and that institutions deMt bsiance at the
olearine -house to-day was again below $400,000.
l>wllne. in the Government bond refunding
operation* has evidently about brought to an
end the process of riisbuiwnient to the money
market by the Bub-treasury. The week's gain
by the barks In cash Is. however, near $5,000,-
COfl. thus promiF-ing an increase In the surplus
Â»yen though the loan expansion has been quite
liberal. No gold was engaged for export to
<â¢>-. Â¦which was according to expectations.
Whether there will be a further movement
next week Is rtill an "pen question.
Railroad bonds hold firm to-day, but thÂ»?
volume of business wan rather light. Total
Bales, par value. $2.455.000.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, April 27.â The wheat market
opened %@%c over yesterday because of higher
cables from Liverpool and the Argentine ship
ments showed a decrease of over 1,000,000
bushels last week. There was a shifting of
Eentlment apparent early and it grew ns the
session progressed. Consideration was given
the poor showing of Indiana, Ohio and Mich
igan and the probability of 2i per cent of a
crop In these States discussed; the report of
the Hessian fly In Illinois was listened to seri
ously and the reports that apprehension over
dry winds in France was felt In that country
and that Argentine arrivals from the Interior
v.ere lessening were given consideration. The
result was a firm, if quiet market. There was
conislderable changing at l%c difference be
tween May and July. May opened at 65%@:65%c.
sold betwesn 65% c and 66% c and closed Hffi%c
over yesterday at 65%@66c; July opened at 61Y*@
67V4c. sold between 67V4'g67ttc and 67% c, closing
up at 67ViÂ«?G7%c.
The corn market was quiet but firm. May
closed \m^c higher at 39%Â®39%c. July, %Â©%c
higher at 40% c. The easing from the top was
on profit-taking. The cash demand -was mod
erate. The liquidation of May was the feature.
May closed %@Uc lower; July, unchanged.
Provisions were quiet, the main demand be
ing for lard. HogÃ were easy, which had a
depressing effect early, but a good general de
mand developed later and the wheat and corn
strength was a. help under which the market
steadied and closed ilrm. July pork closed 2V4c

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK. April 27.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will . say: The un
settling developments In wire and steel stocks
and In the other stocks subsided only to leave
the market dull, apathetic and entirely pro
fessional In character. A large short Interest
was also created and the railroad stock list
up to Wednesday exhibited quite os much pres
sure from that source as from the liquidation
of long holdings. The public apparently has
been frightened by the performances of the in
dustrials and somewhat exaggerated accounts
of the less favorable state of steel and other
Industries, and commission-houses were much
more Inactive than for some weeks past. Lon
don also was reported unfavorably as to Amer
icans, partly by the events here and partly by
the lncr<^ing firmness of Its own money mar
kef and distributed its reduced participation
In the market here between buying and sell
ing, probably taking on balance slightly more
stocks than It sold. - The prospect of gold ex
ports served as a theme for discussion, but
even the announcement that XSOO.OIK) of snecle
would be shipped abroad on Thursday did not
have any particular effect, while the subse
quent decline of exchange ends the fear of a
large gold outflow for this week at least. The
ease in money and Its prospective continuance,
further favorable railroad earnings and ac
counts of conditions which pointed to the mod
ification of pessimistic values regarding Iron,
all contributed toward causing a steady tone at
the declines. From Monday to Wednesday,
however, railroad stocks were subjected to con
siderable selling and moderate concessions were
scored in many securities of that class, the
Industrials, with one important exception, hav
ing lost their speculative attractiveness. Amer
ican Sugar was the feature this week, respond
ing quickly to manipulation which seemed In
tended to force the large short Interest In the
stock to cover. At ths earne time some large
Interests evidently concluded that stocks were
still mainly In strong hands and that the mar
ket has been oversold. On Thursday vigorous
and successful efforts were set on foot to dis
lodge the bears from their position, the result
being heavy covering of short contracts
throughout the list and rallies, which, be
ginning In the prominent railroad shares, ex
tended to some of the Industrials.
button, while the strength of bituminous coal,
partly owing to the strike, but also to the in
creased demand for this product, Is sympathet
ically reeflected In the enlarged demand for the
steam grades of anthracite, which are expected
to be advanced on May 1.
In agricultural products the situation Is gen
erally one of sustained strength. Some slight
shading In wheat prices Is largely the result
of the flattering winter wheat crop prospects In
the sections west of the Mississippi. Spring
wheat seeding is reported almost completed In
the Northwest, much ahead of the average.
The sharp advances In the prices of lumber
last year and the unsettled position of the la
bor situation In the building trades are jointly
held responsible for the rather disappointing
business reported this spring. Hemlock lumber
Is lower and white pine is also weaker, but the
hard \ woods maintain much of their old
strength. /
Wheat, Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3,553,fi53 bushels, against 3,898,
451 last year of the same week, 3.028.403 In the
corresponding week of 1599. 4,449,009 In IS9S,
1,153,886 In 1597 and 1,260,499 In 1536.
Failures for the week In the United States
are well down to the minimum, numbering only
182. an Increase of 21 over laÂ«t week, but two
less than In this week a year ago and compar
ing with 245 in this week of IS9B, 244 in 1807 and
234 In 1596.
Canadian failures of the week number 18, as
compared with 19 last week, 27 in this week
a year ago, 22 In 1898, 31 In 1897 and 26 In 18S6.
Dun's Review of Trade.
NEW YORK, April 27.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
Gold begins to go abroad and prices of Iron
products â¢ break sharply In the same week.
Four months of the new year have passed and
business does not so expand as to need the
large Increase of circulation which the new
monetary bill has permitted, nor enough to sus
tain all the extraordinary advance In prices
last year. The abundance of gold and of cur
rency and the large -disbursements by those In
charge of bonds have rendered rates for money
unusually low for the season here, while rare
Industrial and speculative activity In Europe,
with the war In South Africa, have tended to
make money dearer abroad.
So new gold from Alaska answers the loss
of supply from the Transvaal and America Is
building up In credits abroad a breastwork
against prostration In future here as In the
past caused by troubles In Europe.
The' reaction In prices came where It was
expected least. In the Industry more fully or
ganized than any other to check competition
and In the branch which, through contracts
covering rodmaking and other machinery and
through patents, seemed more fully controlled
than any other. Â¦ A reduction of $20 per ton
in wire nails, barbed wire and galvanized
fence and $1S In smooth wire showed that no
control can afford to hold ; prices so high as
to check consumption. In a week the prices
of Iron products have declined 5.86 per cent,
and fjince February 7. 10.3 per cent. As the
wire and nail prices have been relatively the
highest others In the iron and steel ; Industry
can be expected to fall in like measure. But
pig Iron is weaker. No. 1 local coke at Chi
cago is $23 50 and Southern pig is also lower.
Plates and bars can be obtained for about I.S
cents In good contracts, both at the East and
at Pittsburg, the propesed advance In sheets
to 3.6 cents has not been attempted and nail
mills which have gained much by selling at
7 cents per keg below wire nails will now
lower prices also. The stoppage of a dozen
wire and nail mills, besides rod mills at Joliet
and another of the National Steel Company
Indlcate some change in the actual demand.
In the minor metals the only change has been
In tin. which declined rather sharply to $29 75
In sympathy with lower London quotations.
The tendency toward lower prices is strength
ened by the Idea that overproduction may ap
pear in other branches.
Wool has not changed In quotations, though
some sales of fair amount are â¢ reported at
such prices as 31c for fair Ohio XX and 55c for
clothing, territory cleaned, but manufacturers
are not disposed to do anything and the West
asks prices which dealers have no reason for
paying. The demand for woolen goods Is small
and disappointing, and. except in staples which
are steady beeau*; well sold up, prices are
not encouraging.
Shipments of boots and shoes from the East
In four weeks have been 3CC.323 cas?s, against
339.498 cases last year. 304.061 cases in ISSS and
less In any other year. New business bears no
proportion to the present output and the num
ber of works which are closed or running part
time is increasing. Manufacturers realize that
this is a result of prices asked ami of slow
retail distribution and long stocks remaining
on hand, but claim that lower prices cannot
be made without loss. Business in sole leather
Is reported fair and prices do not yield, but
upper leather Is dull.
The produce market Is inactive, though wheat
yielded a fraction. Exports continue larger
than a year ago, Atlantic exports of wheat in
four weeks, flour included, having been 8,099.
567 bushels, against 8.017.455 bushels last year,
and Pacific exports 2,72."),19C, against 1,373,822
last year.
Failures for the week have been 204 In the
United States, against 184 last year, and 22 in
Canada, against 23 last year.

Harrison's circular says: "It is sinirular how
the coal arrivals at this port will vary Last
week there were seventeen deliveries. " sixteen
from the Coast and one from Australia a total
of 42,895 tons, whereas this week Uiere have
been only six deliveries, five from British Co
lumbia, 15,999 tons, and one from Washington
40CO tons; total. 19,99!Â» tons. Fuel is comint to
hand in the shape of coal and oil. fully as
briskly as t consumers' requirements call for
and th? outlook is pretty well assured for an
accumulation In the yards of the wholesalers
later on. Any reduction from present prices
may not be anticipated, as the market is en
tirely In the hands of the proprietors of the
Coast collieries, notwithstanding there is a lonsr
line of vessels listed to load from \ustralia
with a carrying capacity of 113.C00 tons but the
cost of same landed here Is in excess of the
British Columbia product. English and Scotch
coals are about excluded from this market and
we may look for only spasmodic shipment's of
Welch from Swansea and Cardiff. There were
rumors this week of possible labor troubles in
British Columbia among the miners- â¢ fortu
nately a compromise was effected, and" but lit
tie delay was caused. A oeisaticn of their out
put would cause very serious complications her*
locally. Coal freights from Australia are steariv

Eoosevelt Says That the Nation in
Its Philippine Policy Must
Fight as Lee's Con
queror Fought.
GALENA. 111., April 27.â General U. S.
Grant's birthday was observed here to
day. The event him been celebrated an
nually for ten ye;irs with some speaker of
national reputation as orator, but the cel
ebration to-day was on a more elaborate
scale than heretofore. Governor Roose
velt of New York delivered the principal
oration. Special trains were run by the
railroads, and the announcement that the
fighting Governor was to be present
brought thousands of people into the city
which was for years the home of Grant.
Nearly every business block and hundreds
of private residences were ablaze with
Hags and bunting.
The special train bearing Governor
Roosevelt, Mrs. Nellie Grant Sartorls, her
son. Captain Sartoris; her daughter, Viv
ian Sartoris, and other distinguished vis
itors arrived from Chicago shortly before
the exercises began at Turner Hall.
After a few introductory remarks by
President Spare, Key. Dr. J. \V. Spensley
of Albany, N. y., delivered the invoca
tion. Then after a song. "In liberty's
rÂ»ame, by a male quartet. Governor
Roosevelt was introduced amid great ap
plause.
Governor Roosevelt referred to Wash
ington, Lincoln and Grant as the three
greatest men the nation had produced,
and asked attention not to Grant's life
particularly but to the lessons it taught.
Continuing, he said in parf
In the tnion armies there were generals as
brilliant as Grant, but none with his iron de
termination. This quality he showed as Presi
dent no less than as general. He was no more
to De influenced by a hostile majority In Con
gress into abandoning his attitude in favor of a
sound and stable currency than he was to be
influenced by check or repulse Into releasing
his grip on beleaguered Klchmond. It Is this
element of unshakable strength to which we
are apt especially to allude when we praise a
man in the most effective way, by praising him
as a man. It is the one quality which we can
least afford to lose. It is the only quality, the
lack of which Is as unpardonable in the nation
as In the man. A nation that has not the
power of endurance, the power of dogged In
sistence on a determined policy, come weal or
woe, has lost one chief element of greatness.
The people who wish to abandon the Philip
pines because we have had heavy skirmishing
out there, or who think that our rule Is a fail
ure whenever they discover some sporadic up
growth of evil, would do well to remember the
two long years of disaster this nation suffered
before the July morning when the news was
flashed to the waiting millions that Vicksburg
had fallen in the West and that in the East
the splendid soldiery of I,ee had recoiled at
last from the low hills of Gettysburg. Even
after this nearly two years more were to pass
before the end came at Appomattox. Through
out this time the cry of the prophets of disaster
never ceased. The country was saved by the
fact that our people as a whole were steadfast
and unshaken.
But in onsiderine the life of Grant It Is pe
culiarly appropriate to remember that besides
the regeneration In political and social life
within our own borders, we must also face
what has come upon us from without. No
friendliness with ether nations, no good will,
for them or by them, can take the place of na
tional self-reliance. No alliance, no inoffensive
conduct on our part, would supply, in time of
need, the failure In ability to hold our own
with a strong hand. We should work out out
own dostlny by our own strength. A vigorous
nation lik.-Â» curs does not always stay still. Now
and then there comes a time when It Is sure
either to shrink or to expand. Grant saw to
It that we did not shrink, anil therefore we had
to expand when the Inevitable moment came.
Great <!utl<-p face us In the islands where the
Stars and Stripes now float In place of the ar
roirant flag of Spain. Ab we perform those du
ties well or ill. so will we in large part de
termine our right to a place among the preat
nations of the earth. As a nation we shall have
to choose our representatives In those islands
as carefully as Grant chose the generals who
were to serve at the vital points under him.
Fortunately so far the choice has been most
wise. No nation has ever sent a better man
than we sent to Puba when President McKlniey
appointed as Governor General of that Island
I^eonard Wood: and now in sending Judge Taft
at the head of the <^immlÃsion to the Philip
pine*, the President has apnln chopen the very
best man to be found In all the United States
for the purpose In view.
To do our duty, that lÂ» the num and Kubgtanrn
of the whole matter. We are not trying to win
Blory: we are not trying- to do anything brilliant
or unusual. We are setting ourselves vigor
ously at each task a* the task arises, Rnrt we
are trj'lntr to face each difficulty as Grant faced
innumerable and eminently frreater difficulties.
The sure way to suoreed Is to pet about our
work in the spirit that marked the jrreat fol
dler whose life this day we celebrate: the spirit
of devotion to duty, of determination to deal
fairly. JUFtly and fearlei-sly with all men. and
of iron resolution never to abandon any task
once befrun until It has been brought to a tuc
cessful and triumphant conclusion.

LAMBERT AND
GATES TO BE
PROSECUTED
Summons Issued for Offi
cials of the Steel and
Wire Company.
Washington Seligman, Who Bought
Stock of the Trust Before the
Slump, Charges Them
With Fraud.
Â»
NEW YORK. April 27.â The Times to
morrow will publish the following devel
opments in tho affairs of the American
Steel and Wire Company, likely to cause
a sensation, which were made known yes
terday (Friday). Summonses are now in
the hands of the law firm of Lamb &
Voss for Chairman Gates of the company
board of directors and John Lambert, ttie
president, both of whom left this city for
Chfcago last Wednesday, and it is the in
tention of the attorneys to take further
legal proceedings, which will Include ef
forts to get extradition papers if Gates
and Lambert show no intention of com
ing back to this city.
Magistrate Zeller, who granted the sum
monses at a private hearing, has issued
them in blank, so that the attorneys can
fill In the dates at which they may be
made returnable.
The first complainant in the case was
Washington Seligman of the firm of Se
llgraan & Van Antwerp. There is a sec
ond complainant, whose name has been
withheld.
The summonses against Gates and Lam
bert were issued on application made un
der section 611 of the Penal Code of this
State, headed: "Misconduct of officers
and employes of corporations." Some
time ago it was officially stated that the
directors of the steel and wire company,
In view of the prosperous condition of the
corporation's affairs, intended soon to re
tire $5,000,000 of the preferred stock, the
total amount of which outstanding is $40.
000.000 at par. On the strength of this
statement Washington Seligman and the
other client of Lamb & Voss bought Steel
and Wire preferred stock. When Mr.
Gates shut down twelve of the company's
mills and gave interviews on Monday,
April 16. in which he was quoted as say
ing that the steel and iron business was in
bad shape and that the demand for prod
ucts of his company was hardly 30 per
cent in volume of what it should be, the
common and preferred stock began to
tumble. These have never recovered their
loss. Gates was quoted as prophesying on !
Monday that the price of steel rails would
fall to about $20 a ton in a week, which It
by no means did, and the men who later
procured summonses against them specify j
that statement as unjustifiable.

THEIR DREAM OF NOME
Men Who Bought Shares in a Phan

Been Swindled.
Henry Fuchs has been held In the Po
lice Court, under bonds of $300, on a

pretenses from J. Hammerman of 444
Brannan street and Henry Uehlif of 317
Minna street. Hammerman and Uehlif
haw an advertisement for ten men to go
to Cape Nome.
Their story is that they met Fuchs, who
told them that he wished to form a com
pany of ten with $500 each. Uehlif had
only fCS, but he was an expert miner and
had been In Alaska two years. Fuchs
raid that he would let him In cheaper on
that account and took his $65 and gave
him a receipt for $SCO. Hammerman also

of the company on the payment of $50.
Fuchs promised to buy the men tickets
with their money. No tickets were forth

FOR A DIVISION OF
THE ORIENTAL TRADE
Transcontinental Railroad Presidents
Will Hold Adjourned Meeting
Here to Settle Old Dispute.
An adjourned meeting of transcontin
ental railroad presidents is to be held
In this city during the last week in May,
and the story has been circulated that
the intention is to raise trans-Pacific
rates. Men who are competent to judge
the situation ridicule any such statement.
There is nothing new in the fact that the
meeting is to be held horo. It is posi
tively known that the object of that meet
ing will be to arrange a plan for the divi
sion of the Oriental business among the
American and Canadian linos.
For a long time the Canadian Pacific
road has had a differential of 10 per cent
on business from New York to San Fran
cisco, but the differential did not apply
to Pugct Sound points. The American
roads have tried to get the Canadian Pa
eilic to give up this differential and a
committee of arbitration was appointed.
This committee found in favor of the Am
erican roads. The Canadian Pacific would
not agree to the change, so tho Amer
ican roads threatened to compete with the
Canadian Pacific Steamship line out of
Vancouver. This brought the Canadians
to time and the differential went out in
March. The -meeting to take place here
was adjourned from Denver, where the
discussion concerning the differentials was
begun come time ago.
PRUNING PROCESS ON
KAISER'S NAVAL BILL
Reichstag Budget Committee Elim
inates Much of the Proposed
Increase.
BERLIN. April 27.â The Budget Com
mittee of the Reichstag to-day adopted
by a vote of 20 to S a. motion of the Cen
trists granting, the battleships asked for
by tho Government, but eliminating the
provision for an increase of the foreign
service fleet and reducing the Increase
demanded for the reserve fleet. The pro
posals adopted pro\ - ide that the fighting
fleet shall consist of two flagships, four
squadrons of eight battleships each, eight
large and twenty- four small cruisers; for
foreign service a fleet of three large and
ten small cruisers; for the reserve four
battleships and three large and four small
cruisers, and that the appropriation for
necessary supplies shall be included in the
annual estimates.
By this action of the Budget Committee
the" passage of the naval augmentary bill
Is virtually assured. At all events, this
l<Â« the feeling In Parliamentary circles.
The outcome will be that Germany's
fighting strength on tho sea will be meas
ured by thirty-four large battleships,
thirty-two large and small cruisers and
a score of old battleships which will be
renovated.
The fact that the committee eliminated
the cruisers desired for foreign service
is not regarded as of importance, as Ad
miral yon Tirpltx admitted to-day that
these would not be needed before 1906.
The only unsettled important point, name
ly how to pay for the increase If the
existing taxes prove insufficient, will bo
decided next Tuesday.

MUST EAT LESS IF
WE WOULD GROW OLD
Dr. A. Barkan at Cooper Medical Col
lege Tells a Large Audience How
to Attain Longevity.
The subject of the Lane lecture deliv
ered last night by Dr. A. Barkan at
Cooper Medical College was 1 "Old Age and
Its Hygiene." Some good advice relative
to the attainment of longevity was given
to a large audience. Ihe lecturer spoke
of the disposition of mankind to live a
little longer, no matter at what age it had
arrived, and he explained the beginning,
probable duration and the bright and dark
Bides of old age.
"There is no definite age," said Dr.
Barkan, "at which old age begins. Some
of the greatest works given to the world
have been written by men who had passed
60 years. Among men of genius there is
no old age. The decay of the physical
organs does not always enfeeble the
mental powers.
"What hastens old age among Ameri
cans is their faculty of eating too much,
their lack of exercise and their excessive
use of tobacco. Fewer persons can now
expect to reach old age than formerly on
that account. The Improvement in sani
tary conditions effects a saving of life only
in its first half, where the death rate has
been largely reduced. Past the middle age
there Is only a slight reduction. From 65
to 75 years the death rate has increased.
Women reach advanced age In far larger
proportions than men."

The Supervisor believes that the existing

LAST CONCERT OF
THE TWO RUSSIANS
A great many people availed themselves
of the last opportunity to hear Petsch
nlkoff and Hambourg at the California
Theater yesterday afternoon. The house
was comfortably filled, particularly above
stairs.
The concert was in every sense a treat,
for not only are the powers of these two
artists something extraordinary, but they
have served us with a high class of
music.
Petchnikoff's selections have been par
ticularly dignified. '
He has never once lapsed into the cheap
and popular for the sake of gaining ap
plause. Hambourg's numbers have
been of the sensational kind occasionally,
but he has given us only the better class
of musical tours de force, which are
adapted to show off his peculiar ability.
The wonder of his titanic strength
and amazing velocity is matter for mar
vel. It is really not surprising 1 that he
sweeps his audiences away in waves of
enthusiasm. He takes them by storm
rather than by any particular charm he
possesses.
He played Beethoven's E flat Sonata
more pleasingly than any other com
position of such character he has at
tempted, and shone to advantage in the
difficult finale. His own "Espieglerle"
and a study in octaves of Rubinstein,
which by the way was infinitely more
interesting than a similar study of
Letschetizkl, which he gave at his first
concert, were stupendous tests of tech
nique and endurance, yet nothing daunted
by their severity he supplemented them
with the second Rhapsodic.
Petschnlkoff played Mendelssohn's E
minor concerto, admirably accompanied
by Lachaume, and also the C major
fugue of Bach, an involute array of dif
ficulties. He solved this problem, which
has rarely been undertaken without loss
of his usual ease and accuracy. His
beautiful intonation is a source of delight,
and two encores which he gave were ap
pealing in the breadth, sweetness and
purity of his tone.

of the'estate rather than the care of her
person. Her ladyship was left largely .to
her own devices as to matters of resid
ence and consumption of fancy dinners
and fancy "bottled goods." That this
consumption must have been considerable
is shown by a bill for $200 for these two
items presented by the proprietor of A
Mon Chateau, a suburban hostelry at
Pleasant Valley, to the court last Mon
day.
Mrs. Safford arrived from the' East a
few days ago and at once determined that
thÂ«=re should be r.n more high living at A
Mon Chateau and no more troubles in
court over the rayment of bills for "bot

of her sister should be controlled, whether
the estate went to smash or not. So the

this is completed a second tunnel will be
built lower down to secure a bettor grade.
It will be 7000 feet long and will cost near

Methodist Bishops I/cave the Ques-
tion to the Decision of the
â¢ Conferences.
INDIANAPOLIS. April 27.â The first
day's session of the bishops of the Metho
dist church was taken up In the discus
sion of the conditions in the different con
ferences. When approached on the sub
ject of changes in the discipline of the
church and the insertion of a law pro
hibiting both dancing and theater-going,
Bishop Warren said:
"Nothing along this line will be done
at our meeting. As a matter of fart,
we could not decide upon this point. The
staff of the bishops of the t-hurch simply
represents the executive body and we
simply execute the orders of the confer
ences. In the matter of the rules of the
church, I don't know that any important
changes will be made at the General Con
ference in Chicago, unless It will be to
allow laymen an equal representation at
the conference. To do this requires a
three-fourths vote, and I think the senti

MORE REVENUE FRAUDS
UNEARTHED BY THOMAS
Thouand Pounds of Overweight To
bacco Seized From Various
Dealers in This City.
Revenue Agent Burt M. Thomas has
seized 1000 pounds of plug cut tobacco In
one ounce packages from various dealers
in this city on the ground that the manu
facturers. Sparger Brothers Company of
Mount Airy. N. C, were defrauding the
revenue department by affixing "one
ounce" revenue stamps to packages
weighing one and an eighth ounces.
The case has been reported to the Sec
retary of the Treasury and an examina
tion of the offending factory will be made
for the purpose of ascertaining how many
of the overweight packages have been put
upon the market. The penalty for de
frauding the Government Is the confisca
tion of the whole factory and stock, but
it is usual to -impose a fine equal to three
times the value of the delinquent revenue.
Revenue officials are also engaged In
examining into the affairs of the tobacco
factory of Wcisort Brothers In St. Louis,
with the view of determining the extent
ml overweight frauds, several thousand
pounds of their tobacco having been
seized in this city by Agent Thomas for
having been insufficiently stamped.

in the composite, but as to detail.

she was waylaid Tuesday night, now ad

BOLD BURGLAR
IS SHOT AT BY
A BRAVE WOMAN
Robber Surprised While at
Work by a Guest in
the House.
Makes a Dash for the Street and
Gets Away, Apparently Un
scathed by the Bullet Sent
After Him.
*
A bold burglar made an attempt to rob
the residence of Harry Hutt. 3026 Sacra
mento street, early last night, but was
frightened away by the quick action of
Mrs. Hutt and Mrs. Emily Martell, her
guest.
Mrs. Hutt seized a revolver and fired at
the fleeing burglar which action caused
him to run the faster.
At. about S o'clock last night Mrs.
Martell, who is stopping for a few days
with Mrs. Hutt, heard a noise in the din-
Ing room, and when a few seconds later
the noise was repeated she started to in
vestigate. As Mrs. Martell reached in
the dark for the door of the dining room
Fhe was more than surprised to put her
hand on a man's face. She grabbed at
the figure and screamed to Mrs. Hutt
that a robber was in the house.
The would-be burglar took to his heels
and ran down the stairs to the street.
Just as he was disappearing Mrs. Hutt
came from her room, pistol in hand, and
lired a shot in the direction of the bur
glar. In a few moments a crowd, attract
ed by the ehot. gathered in front of the
house, but before any one thought of
chasing the object of Mrs. Hutt's pistol
practice the man was out of sight.
It is barely possible that the brave
woman may have hit the burglar. Mrs.
Hutt said last night that the burglar
evidently seeing that there was no light
in the house except In the kitchen, took
a desperate chance to rob the premises,
hoping the occupants would remain in the
kitchen long enough to allow him to com
plete his work.
Mrs. Martell in speaking of the affair
said that the man wore no mask and his
hat was well back on his head. On ac
munt of the room being dark she could
not clearly distinguish th<* man's features
and was consequently unable to give a
good description of him.
"The man was evidently more surprised
than I, and he made quick time getting
out of reach." said Mrs. Martell. "As
Foon as I screamed 'Burglars!' Mrs. Hutt
camp running out and fired at him. - We
looked through the hall, but could not
find any bullot ho!e and Mrs. Hutt's shot
may have taken effect. There is no doubt
the man Intended to ransack the house
while we were in the kitchen, but In the
darkness he upset a small table and the
noise attracted our attention."
The police have been notified of the at
tempt at burglary. .
Mrs. Hutt Is the wife of Harry Hutt, a
conductor on the Sacramento-street Rail
way.
DARING CROOK
LANDED BEHIND
PRISON WALLS
James Moffitt, an Old Of
fender, Locked Up in
SI the Tanks.
Passed a Number of Bogus Checks
on the Unsuspecting Keepers
of Various Lodging-
Houses.
t
t -
Locked In the tanks of the City Prison
Is James Moffltt, a noted crook, for whom
the police have been looking for some
time. He was arrested yesterday by Po
lice Officer Isaacs and locked up pending
further Investigation. .
During the past month Moffltt, who the
police say Is an old offender, has been
working off bogus checks on the keepers
of lodging-houses. His scheme Is to visit
a lodging-house and after asking for the
landlady he represents himself as a cattle
man who has Just arrived from Montana.
After selecting a room he hands her a
"phony" check for a small amount and
Is given the difference, which usually does
not amount to over two. or three dollars.
On receiving the change the bold crook
generally leaves the place, after inform
ing his victim that he is troubled with in
somnia and that It is necessary for him
to take a long walk before retiring for
the night. Of course, he does not return,
and when the landlady attempts to cash
the check she Is told that It Is a forgery.
In this manner Moffltt has successfully
Imposed on at least twenty lodging-house
keepers during the past month. His oper
ations became so bold that Chief of Police
Sullivan detailed two of the best men to
arrest him, but their efforts went for
naught. " .
Yesterday Policeman Isaacs, who was
acquainted with Moffltt. met him on
Kearny street and took him Into custody.
He showed a disposition to resist the of
ficer, but was promptly placed hors de
combat by a well directed blow. The -pa
trol wagon was summoned and the forger
was removed to the City Prison. He was
afterward positively Identified by a num
ber of his victims.
,MoflHt is an old offender, having been
arrested on a number of occaslons-for sim
ilar offenses. When searched at the City
Prison a number of bogus checks similar
to the ones passed on unsuspecting land
ladles were found in his possession.

UNIONIZED labor in San Francisco
Â¦will at no distant day have its own
building, in which all of the differ
ent unions can and no doubt will
hold their meetings. As it is now, the
headquarters of the different labor unions
are scattered all over the city. It Invaria
bly happens that workmen on coming to
the city find considerable trouble In lo
cating the headquarters of the union
with which they wish to visit or affiliate.
With the erection of the proposed new
temple all this will be a thing of the past,
and the men whose bone and sinew have
made San Francisco what it is will have
a house built hy their own hands into
which they can enter and- hold their meet
ings without the necessity of paying rent
to ethers. As already announced, all the
stock will be owned by the men them
selves through their organizations.
MAY BE THE HOME OF ORGANIZED LABOR.
The above plan has not as yet been ac
cepted by the committee appointed to pass
on designs submitted, but inasmuch as
Mr. Malsbary, the designer, is a practical
builder and is also chairman of the com
mittee, his plans and Ideas will receive
courteous consideration when the commit
tee'meets, a week from to-day, to take
final action on the selection of a site and
to decide what kind of a building will

HENNESSY MADE
THE SCAPEGOAT
OFTHE SCANDAL
Piggott, Lynch and Martin
Exonerated From All
Blame.
The Western Turf Association Breaks
Its Word in Ruling "Mike"
Hennessy Off the Turf
for Life.
As predicted in The Call the great turf
scandal blew up like a typhoon on the
China Sea. then disappeared like a gentle
summer zephyr. At the meeting of the
Western Turf Association stewards, held
at the Palace Hotel yesterday forenoon,
D. J. Lynch, Joe Piggott, the jockey, and
â¢â¢Wiliie' : Martin, the ex-jockey, were com
pletely exonerated of the charges made
against them by "Mike" Hennessy, also
a. rider. In a confession made to the stew
ards of the California Jockey Club. The
result of the Inquiry Is herewith quoted:
In the matter of Daniel Lynch el al.â The
board of stewards of the Western Turf Asso
ciation alter a careful Investigation In this
case of ail the evidence (.Inciummc affidavits
furnished by the California Jockey Club) do
find thtt the weight of evidence cleariy ex
onerates eaid Daniel Lynch from any complic
ity In the fraudulent ride on the horse Hard
Knot of date March 16, lSvu. confessed to by
fcls rider. Jockey Hennessy, and that therefore
eald cl-.u.rgrv as to Daniel Lynch are dismissed.
We do further Mnd nothing in all the f\ ldenct;
In this case to Implicate eithera Jockeys Mgg-ott
or Willie Martin In any wrongdoing, and the
charges as to them in this matter are dis
missed.
The conduct, evidence and admissions of
Jockey Hennessy in the Hard Knot ride,
coui'led with other evidence, while directed
against parties proven j n tn j g investigation to
be absolutely Innocent, we do find incriminate
no one but Jockey Hennessy himself, and there
fare eaid Jockey Hennessy is hereby ruled off.
We do further find in the matter of the
Pirate J entry and race, which was coupled
Â¦with the foreeroinc complaint, nothing of a
fraudulent character in either said entry or race
Implicating said Daniel Lynch as alleged, and
Â»ald charge is therefore dismissed.
This Is a direct flap, and it mifrht be
said insult, on the part of the Tanforaji
Park people to the Oakland Association.
fis Â¦well as a gross breach of good faith.
In the interest of good racing and honest
sport Thomas H. Williams Jr., of the Cal
lforr.ia Jockey Club, furnished F. H.
Green, secretary of the Western Turf As
sociation, with the statement made by
Hennessy. the purport of which was that
crooked racing had been going on at Tan
foran and giving the names of the persons
alleged to be participating in same. As
a remuneration Hennessy. who was then
under suspension for a suspicious ride at
Oakland on the two-year-old Lucldla, was
promised immunity from punishment and
reinstatement. Those facts were conveyed
to Secretary F. H. Greon and that turf
man ni asked if his association would
stand by the agreement if the disclosures
were furnished his association. He replied
in the affirmative and received the allega
tions of Hennessy.
Then, after a three nights' session, the
stewards of the Western Turf Association
render a decision almost awarding Lynch,
Piggott and Willt<- Martin gold medals
for their brazen clevr-rness and effrontery,
while HenxMCsy is rul<nl off the turf.
It is possible and not altogether improb
able that the assertions made by Hen
nessy contain many discrepancies, and
that Lynch. Piggott ot al. were unjustly
accused; but what oxcuse is there for this
action of a so-called reputable racing as
sociation? Once before, in the notorious
Lobos case, the California Jockey Club
sent to the Pacific Coast Jockey Club pos
itive proof of gross fraud in connection
with the running at that fast colt, only to
have the same returned by Corrigan and
his confreres, perhaps because they shared
in the spoils gained through the victory
of Trainer Mason's charge. At any rate,
the whole thing was squashed with the
alacrity of a police court shyster.
There are wide variances in the state
ments made by Hennessy and Lynch to
the stewards. Hennessy in his deposition
says: "I think I got something like $75
for the two rides on the horse." meaning
Hard Knot. Lynch distinctly says he
pave the jockey $53 and later $10 additional
for winning on tho horse. Hennessy also
takes credit for thinking he is the only
one acquainted with the identity of Pirate
J. while Lynch names half a dozen horse
men who saw the gelding work at Ingle
fide end knew him immediately from his
Eastern efforts.
Dut. weak as Hennessy's assertions may
be in spots, and strong as are the denials
of Lynch and Piggott. common d^cencv
and rc-spoct would consider the Western
Turf Association bound, as a reputable
body of the American turf, to keep Its
word.
TAX RATE MAY
RUN OVER THE
DOLLAR LIMIT
Estimate of Police and Fire
Departments Can Be
Increased.
Charter Provides for a Larger Com
plement of Men Than That on
Which They Have Been
Reorganized.
?
Auditor Wells Is of the opinion that the
next tax rate may be considerably above
the dollar limit If the Fire Commissioners
carry out their expressed Intention to ask
the Supervisors for all the money they
are entitled to under the charter. In
hiaking its estimate of expenditures for
the next fiscal year the Fire Department
asked for $740,237, but the figure was vol
untarily reduced to $705,893 after consul
tation with the Auditor. This reduction
was effected by reducing the fire compan
ies from ten to eight men, though the
charter says that ten shall be the full
complement.
The Auditor states that a number of
extra men and employes In the corpora
tion yard were cut out, but If the Fire
Commissioners* Insist upon their demand,
the Supervisors will be compelled to give
It to them.
The Police Department has also been
cut down below what is provided by the
charter. One policeman is permitted for
every five hundred inhabitants. At pres
ent 525 men are calculated upon, but with
the estimated population of 300,000 the city
would be entitled to 600 patrolmen.
Should the Fire and Police Departments
press their claims the .expenditures will
be largely increased over the figures sub
mitted by the Auditor and the dollar limit
will naturally be exceeded.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors will meet next week to hear
the complaints of the various municipal
departments' against the Auditor's esti
mate for the next fiscal year. It Is thought
that the estimate will be raised in some
instances and reduced In others. It is
certain that the estimates of the Fire and
Police Departments will not be lowered.
The Auditor's estimate of the tax levy
which he has placed at exactly $1 for cur
rent expenses has been calculated on a
basis of an assessed valuation of $400,000,
000. Assessor Dodge says that It will be
fortunate If the roll reaches $375,000,000
If he is correct the tax rate will
be largely in excess of $1 under the pres
ent form of municipal government.
