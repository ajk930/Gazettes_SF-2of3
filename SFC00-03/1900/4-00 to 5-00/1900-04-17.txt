TWELVE STEEL AND
WIRE MILLS CLOSED
Overproduction Results in Depriving 1
Thousands of Laborers of
Employment.
NEW YORK, April 16.â John Gates,
president of the American Steel and Wire
Company, was seen to-day in reference to
a dispatch from the West which stated
that a number of constituents concerned
in the main company had suspended op
erations. He confirmed the statement and
said that twelve of the mills in the con
stituent companies have been shut down.
They are located at Pittsburg, Cleveland.
Jollet, Waukegan. 111.; De Kalb, Ind.;
Newcastle, Ind.. and Anderson, Ind.
Mr. Gates said the cause of the closing
down of the mills was overproduction.
He was unable to state when the mills
would resume operations, as they first
would have to ascertain the extent of th*
overproduction. When asked as to his
view as to the trade situation and outlook
Mr. Gates said the shut down of the mills
was the best evidence of the current sit
uation.
Mr. Gates made another statement later,
in which he said the twelve mills which
had been closM had a daily capacity of
from 3000 to 4000 tons. He said that slack
business was an additional reason for the
suspension of operations.
The best Information is that the mills
will be closed indefinitely. Jt is said as
many as 4000 men, boys and girls will be
affected by the shutdown.

NAVAL BOARD ORGANIZES.
Press Notified That All Proceedings
Will Be Secret.
WASHINGTON. April 16.â The new na
val policy boarÂ£ held its first meeting at
Hie N:ivy Department to-day. There were
present Admiral Dewey, the president of
the board; Admiral Crownlnshield. Cap
tains Chadwick, Taylor. Evans. Clark,
Figsb^; Colonel Rted. U. S. M. C; Com
mander Mulligan. Commander Asa Walk
er and Lieutenant Ward, the latter being
secretary of the board. An organization
â¢was effected, and. after a general discus
sion of the scope of the work to be under
taken and the probable advantages of
Kub-ulviding the labors of the board, an
adjournment was taken.
The board decided at the outset that the
character of the work to be undertaken,
Involving as It does the prepartlon of
ffenernes of defense of the country, Â¦ an
well as offensive campaigns, renders it
absolutely necessary that secrecy shall
surround every proceeding. Therefore,
the press has been given' to understand
that the work of the body will not fur
nish material for current news.
The Daily News has the following from Reddersburg, dated Friday: "General Chermside
saw the rearguard of the Boers disappear southeast in full retreat. The enemy appear to be in
strong force four miles east of Redaersburg.. They are falling back before our advance guard."
LONDON, April 17. 4:15 a. m.â Lord
Roberts "has spread his net far and
wide to catch the adventurous com
mandos that have been making
mischief in the southeastern part
of the Free State. The net has not yet
been drawn in. but at the headquarters
of Lord Roberts the Impression exists
that the power of the Boers is decreasing.
The Daily News correspondent has them
fleeing to the southeast; a Standard cor
respondent reports them fleeing north
ward: a Daily Telegraph correspondent
says that some are going north and others
south, while a Morning Post represen
tative says it is not known what the
Boers are doing.
Evidently the feeling at Bloemfontein Is
that the dispositions of Lord Roberts are
such as to enable him to concentrate a
large force rapidly at any point. The
Boers, being aware of this, are presumed
to be thinking now chiefly of retreat.
The investment of W'epener, according
to a special dispatch from Bloemfonteln.
has absolutely been abandoned. Accord-
Ing to a Bethany dispatch the Boers are
unable to retreat northward because the
British strongly hold all roads. Diverse
reports come from Natal, one asserting
that the Boers have; retired beyond the
Blggarsberg range and another saying
that some of them are close to Ladysmith.
London waijs confidently for almost im
mediate announcement of news favorable
to the British. t ,
Distrust exists, however, as to any
rapid, continuous advance toward Pre
toria, chiefly on account of the lack of
horses, many, of .which die In the course
of the long voyages. Letters from the
Cape say that three days' journey by rail
is made in open trucks, that the arrange
ments for feeding and watering are inad
equate and that the unfortunate animals
break down rapidly In consequence of
these hardships. '; ;>

DAVIS INTERCEDED
FOR YOUNG MR. HAY
. KANSAS CITY. April 16.â A Washine
ton dispatch to the Journal states that
but for the intercession of Webster Davis,
late Assistant Secretary of the Interior,
Adelbert Hay, son of the Secretary of
State, would not have received his exe
quatur as American Consul at Pretoria.
Mr. Davis was 'In Pretoria about the
time Mr. Hay's arrival was expected. The
Transvaal officials had heard of the new
comer's sojourn In London, had heard
that he had placed himself In communica
tion with the Foreign Office there, and
actually had had an interview with L6rd
Salisbury. They had been further In
formed that after his appointment Mr.
Hay had held a three hours' conference
with John Hays Hammond, convicted of
high treason. against the Transvaal Gov
ernment and now an active campaigner
against the Boer cause.
It was at this stage of the case of Con
sul Hay. according to the Journal's Wash
ington correspondent, that State Secre
tary Reitz took the Assistant Secretary
of the Interior into his confidence.
"See here, Davis," said Reitz, "it will
never do for us to receive this young
man and admit him .to the confidential re
lations to which he is entitled as Ameri
can Consul, With the impressions which
he must have received In London In con
sultation with our enemies it would be
suicidal. We would be harboring an emis

took up young Hay's case. He advised

dispatch dated April 18. says: "The Boers
are down again at Dewdorp, east of
Ladysmith."
Secretary Reitz to receive him, partly be
cause he wished to avoid any possibility
of offending the American Secretary of
State and partly because he trusted to the
impressions young Hay would receive
from personal contact with the Boers to
convert him into a friend of the repub
lics. On the plea made- by< Davis young
Hay escaped the humiliation of being sent
home as persona non grata.
BOERS BOLDLY PROWL
NEAR BLOEMFONTEIN
LONDON. April 17.â The Bloemfonteln
correspondent of the Morning Post; tele
graphing Monday, says: "Small bodies of
Boers are prowling around and are even
coming within eight or ten miles of
Bloemfqntein. ' Three Johannesburg
'zarps' 'actually entered , the town one
night and escaped without being discov
ered. ' '
"The Boer demonstration yesterday at
Karee Siding was 1 designed to cover the
withdrawal of ah Immense convoy of pro
visions. .There is no doubt that the Boer
Incursion into the southeastern part of
the Free State was largely due" to 'the
need of replenishing victuals in the most
fertile part' of the country.' This explains
why the I enemy marched south with
empty wagons. 5 Various important move
ments are occurring, which naturally It
is not desirable to; specify."
GRANTED PERMISSION

The suit Is brought against the sons of
Charles Fleischmann. who died recently,
leaving property worth $7,000,000. One of
them, Julius, was a week ago elected
Mayor of Cincinnati, in which city the
books required are.
Maximilian J. Fleischmann named his
wife as his executrix and his brother
Charles as his executor, and requested
that the' partnership be continued, and
that the relations between his family and
that of his brother should always be ami

Charles Fleischmann, soon after her hus
band's death, began efforts to obtain pos
session of the whole business and induced
her to sign several papers which turned
out to be releases of her interest in the
good will and profits of the business. The
defendants opposed the motion on five
grounds, all of which Justice Lawrence
says are untenable. One of them was
that Mrs. Fleischmann had lost her right
to sue on account of laches, and that her
suit could not be maintained.
MAJOR KNIGHT'S ACT
WILL BE INVESTIGATED
Approved the Course of a Sentry Who
Refused a Priest Entry to an

WASHINGTON. April 18.â The Secretary
of War has ordered an Investigation made
at New York City of the charge that Ma
jor D. G. Knight, Corps of Engineers,
commanding the engineering school at
Willets Point, New York. Interfered with
Father Tierney of the Roman Catholic

the priest had been stopped at the en
trance to the post at the point of a bayo
net and that the action of the sentry had
been subsequently upheld by the com
manding officer.
Representative Fitzgerald of Massachu

In pull Retreat (Hong tfye Basutoland
Border Closely Watched by the
Warlike Tribesmen.
LOS ANGELES, April 18â With the
exposure of the organized system of
importing Chinese contract labor
the facts are reached that the con
spiracy to defraud the United
States may involve a Government official
holding an Important foreign billet: that
several Los Angeles citizens are under
suspicion- and that a Chinese highbinder
faction is in absolute control of the se
crets surrounding this nefarious business.
From evidence that has been collected
the exposures that followed the coast in
vestigations compelled the shifting of the
base of operations from San Francisco
to Mazatlan, Where different tactics to
encompass the same results were Insti
tuted.
The ringleaders of this gang of smug
glers of human flesh was one Wong Kirn.
His connection through Government offi
cials is directly traced. Kirn was se^n by
Â¦witnesses and inspectors of San Fran
cisco in Mazatlan and in Los Angeles.
Through this operator the plan to }n
struct Chinese how the American law
could be evaded by coaching them as to
its requirements was adopted. This was
demonstrated when seven Chinese, who
claimed to be native son.?, and two who
were known to be merchants, were held,
for deportation. They described under
what conditions they had met Kirn near
Canton, how they v.-ere sent in bond to
San Francisco, but later were transferred
to Mazatlan and finally entered the
United States by landing at Ensenada
and at night crossing the line at San Di
ego. These were the forerunners of a
gang of three hundred Chinese that were
later to land if the scheme on Mexican
soil worked.
To-night United States District Attor
ney F. P. Flint said:
"But the first batch coming to grief so
early the plan was nipped. That this
smuggling plan existed is no fiction, for
the convincing evidence was produced.
How many hundreds may have entered
this country before the l'~ht dawned
through the efforts of ofilctrs none can
tell. The records are filled with cases in
which every attempt was made to reach
legal requirements, and the cunning de
vices and the magnitude of the testimony
unearthed showed that clever heads were
the originators and exploiters. In nearly
every instance these Chinese claimed to
he American born, but the end proved
that the unfortunates came from China
on tramp steamers. The only remedy and
to enforce the exclusion act is to give
customs collectors who are held respon
sible for its enforcement the necessary
time to make this class of business a
specialty."
Attorney Flint further said that for
years the Chinese Â«-arae Into. this country
by landing in Lower California and in the
course of a few months, by coasting in
small vessels to lessen the suspicion, ar
rive at Ensenada and evade the San
Diego office.
In the opinion of officials here the LO3
Angeles exposures forced the manipula
tors to concentrate their efforts at San
Francisco to carry out the contracts that
had been made in China and that the
same heads that engineered the southern
plan, if exposures are pushed, will later
be found to be identical.
An Investigation is now being made and
is nearly concluded by special agents of
the Treasury Department regarding a
"school of instruction" for Chinese at
Mazatlan, Mexico, where Chinese who
have been refused admittance at San
Francisco. Portland. Los Angeles or other
ports are taken and put through a course
and equipped to be able to prove that they
are native born. Several have been tried
in the United States courts here, and
about 90 per cent have been deported.
There Is a rumor that the acts of the
American Vice Consul at Mazatlan have
been investigated in this case and- that
local men are implicated also.
: Deputy Collector of Internal Revenue
John C. Wray, when asked if he had any
knowledge of the reported influx of Chi
nese, stated that violations of this char
acter do not come under his control, but
that he has reason to believe that Chinese
are being run into Southern California
from the Hawaiian Islands and Mexico.
In December last, while investigating
wine interests in Upper Santa Barbara
County, he was furnished information
relative to two Chinese laborers who were
at work on a ranch In Ventura County
and who were without certificates. The
information as it reached him was given
to Chinese Inspector Putnam. In Santa
Barbara County he gathered the informa
tion or rumor that Chinese were being
landed on Anacappa Island and then
transferred to the mainland under the
guise of abalone fishermen. Recently
three Chinese were found on Anacappa in
a starved condition, one subsequently dy
ing from the effects of exposure and star
vation. Rumor had It at the time that
they were part of a gang who had been
run In and left on the island awaiting
transportation to the mainland.
NOTHING DONE TO CHECK
THE RUSH OF JAPANESE
WASHINGTON. April 16.â Up to this
point nothing has been done by the Wash
ington authorities looking toward the re
striction of the immigration of Japanese
into this country beyond the application
of the contract labor laws. The enforce
ment of these laws is entrusted to the
officials of the Treasury Department and
so far as Is known they have not dis
covered any movement toward the bring
ing Into the United States of Japanese
coolies under labor contracts. They are
not, however, authorized to Interfere with
the Incoming of the Japanese who can
satisfy the requirements of the laws In
the matter of freedom from contract ob
ligations and ability to maintain them
selves. It is believed that unlike other
Orientals, few Japanese, even of the la
boring classes, fall to make a sufficient
showing on these points to pass muster
and secure admission at the Golden Gate.
If, however, the tide of Japanese Immi
gration now setting toward the British
Northwestern possessions should include
Japanese coolies under contract to labor
In the United States, there will be neces
sity for a considerable reinforcement of
the Â¦ treasury employes charged with thÂ«
policing of the- boundary lines between

There is no formal obligation upon the
British Colonial authorities to prevent
such people from crossing the line be
yond that of mere neighborly Interest, a
consideration not always sufficient to stop
Illicit dumping of undesirable immigrants.

The first blood shed as the outcome
of the strike at the Croton dam
was the life's blood of Sergeant
Robert Douglass cf the Eleventh
separate Company of Mount Vernon, who
v.as shot dead by an unknown assassin
while he was relieving guard at 8:50
o'clock to-night. The wildest excitement
prevailed throughout the camp as soon
as the news of the assassination spread
tn the different tents and the soldiers are
frantic over the crime.
The point where the sergeant fell is
known as Post 10, which wes in charge
of Corporal McDowell. It is situated on
tnp of the hill, near Little Italy, where
arra^d strikers were seen drilling or
marching about early this morning.
brandiflilng rifles and shotguns. The spot
is high ovÂ» r the huge pile cf masonry ar.d
from it one can command a view of the
country on each side up and down the
Croton Valley.
Douglass was talking to Corporal Mc-
Dowell and the other members of the
guard when he suddenly clapped hi?
fcsnds to his stomach txclaimlng, "Lord,
boys, I'm shot." and immediately fell to
the ground.
It was pitch dark at the time, but, Mc-
Dowell ar.d the others fired a volley into
a clump Of bushes nearby without hitting
any one. No one saw the flash or heard
the sound of the shot which killed Doug
lass, and it was a most mysterious affair.
Meanwhile the men picked up the fallen
p<rgt-ant and carried him down the hill
on a stretcher, but as soon as they
reached Douglass' tent the poor fellow.
died without saying a word. Lieutenant
Clover, with a squad, went up to the hill
t-;p, where they made a thorough search,
but failed to fir.d ar.y person up there.
Then th<- guards were called in and con
centrated in the valley, with the excep
tion of those placed at the cable station
where thÂ« shooting took place.
At about 10:30 o'clock to-night the Dep
uty Sheriff* who were guarding the cable
)iÂ«. use on the east side of the river saw
three figures lurking near the place and
the deputies fir.^d their revolvers at them.
The figures disappeared quickly in the
darkness. A few minutes later, while the
dppuiif-s thought there was no person
near them, three shots rang out from the
direction of Little Italy, but the Sheriffs
men wt-re not injured.
At about 8 o'clock this evening three
Italians were found within the lines, and
when searched by the 'soldiers each was
found to ha\ - e a loaded _ revolver on him.
The soldiers extracted the cartridges from
Â«fee re%'olvers and returned the weapons to
the m<*n. who were allowed to go away.
When Sergeant Douglass was killed he
â¢had one of these same cartridges In his
pocket, and. a? he was one of the men
who unloaded .1 c weapon, it is thought
â¢that the shot irhlcfa killed him was fired
by one- of the thrre men who had been al
lowed 10 po fret- wtth thehr empty pistols
I scarcely an hour previous.
Early this morning the strikers held a
meetlnc and. CndlnE that no effort was
to be made to work the dam, dispersed.
From the New York newspapers they
learned that troops were on the way. Be
fore the hour for their arrival the Bowery
was filled by Italians, who stood in groups
and listened to the talk of the leaders. At
11 o'clock a telegram was received by one
of the leaders from Consul Bianchi, advis
ing them to be quiet and informing them
of the fact that the militia was on its
way to tho dam.
It was after noon when the special train
from Vonkers carrying the two companies
of troops arrived here. Their arrival was
r)otel by an Italian on a bicycle, who re
mained lor.g enough about the station to
count them and then started for the dam.
About half a mile from the village he was
met by another strike messenger on a
wheel, who carried the news a mile,
whence a third messenger rode with all
haste to the Bowery.
Before the Deputy Sheriffs about the
works knew of the arrival of troops in
Croion Valley the strikers were aware of
it. There was a blowing of horns, and
while the troops were resiing at the sta
tion, waiting for the word to move, forty
r.rmed Italians, carrying an American flag
and two Italian flags, crossed the Little
Italy Hill to the Bowery. They were
cheered by the men in the Bowery and
watched with . interest by the Deputy
Sheriffs.
When the troons had been rested and
the wagons carrying the camp equip
ment had been loaded the march to the
dam was bcrjuri. When they were ap
prcaching the Bowery three nervous
miiitiamen accidentally discharged their
rifle?, but no ono was hurt. As the
troops swung into the .narrow lane called
the Bowery a strange sight met their
eyes. About 2CO men were on the broad
sidewalks. Flass were hanging from the
windows and held by the men crowded
en the stoops. About twenty Italians
with mandolins and guitars were seated
en the walk playing a lively tune. To
day was Kaster Monday, a holiday in
Italy.
The militiamen pitched their camp in
side the ground, where construction work
on the dam is temporarily suspended, and
patrols were thrown out. Everything was
quiet and the strikers' leader. Angelo
Rottella, said that there would be no
trouble.
"We dp not propose to fight soldiers,"
he declared. "We are behaving and we
gave the soldiers a fine welcome with our
mandolins and guitars."
After their peaceable reception the mi
litiamen had no thought of a plot such
as resulted in to-night's tragedy.
NEW YORK. April 16.â Major Oliver B.
Bridgman. in command of Squadron A,
on its way to the strike at Croton Land
ing this afternoon, was "thrown from his
horse and his leg was broken. The acci

6t>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 16.â The Standard
Electric Company, which has Its plant at
Blue Lakes, Alpine County, is preparing
to begin active operations in San Jose and
Santa Clara County. Bonds to the extent
of $5,000,000 were recently floated in New

available for work in a few weeks. Three
carloads of cables and wires are now at
the depot and during the present week
four more cars of storage batteries and
machinery will arrive from Pittsburg.
At present a force of workmen are
erecting poles and stringing wires through

is said they will reach Alvlso by May 20.
Alvlso is to be the distributing"point for
the three lines running to San Francisco,
Oakland and San Jose. In this city an
immense storage plant will be erected, so

machinery is now completed and ready.
The work of erecting poles and string
ing wires along the various county roads

that way," Dr. Birch said. "He has ever
since I can remember, but he la a good
Presbyterian Just the same. He does not
believe what he said and yet I don't want
to seem to be calling him Insincere, either.
He belongs to that class of men who have
existed since the church â¢ was founded,
who want the confession of faith abol
ished for a short creed. It amounts to the
same thing, but the change can't be made,
for the Presbyterian church is founded on
the confession." . . ; â¢>*:. â¢ -â¢â¢ â¢ &';Â»
The ' Rev. Dr. Arthur C. McGlffert'a let
ter, of withdrawal from the Presbytery,
which has created such a profound sen
sation, is as follows: Â¦
Dear Brethrenâ ln view of the appeal to the
General Assembly of which Dr. Birch gave for
mal notice at the last meetlne of the presby
tery. I have decided to withdraw from the
Presbyterian Church, and I request that you
will accordingly drop my name from the roll
of the presbytery.
In making: this request I desire to say that I
60 not withdraw because I regrard the charges
of heresy preferred against me as well founded,
or because I recognize the Justice of the accus
ations that have been made in many quarters,
tor I still believe, as I believed when I wrote
to the General Assembly . last Spring, that my
views are In harmony with the faith of the
Presbyterian Church and of evangelical Chris
tendom in all vital and essential matters, but
I cannot feel that it Is my duty to no through
thn trial before the General Assembly which
the appeal will doubtless precipitate, and I am
unwlllijig needlessly to prolong the agitation
that has been distracting the church and pre
venting it from giving itself unreservedly to its
true work of advancing the kingdom of God.

THUGS BROUGHT IN
TO COW UNION MEN
Former County Commissioner's Story
of the Conditions in the Coeur
d'Alenes.
WASHINGTON. April 16.â The Coeur
d'Alene investigation was resumed to-day
with W. R. Stimson, one of the former
County Commissioners of Shoshone Coun
ty, on the stand to rebut features devel
oped in the previous testimony. Kis evi
dence was to the effect that he was re
moved from office by the State and mili
tary authorities because they believed he
would not serve their purpose. He de
clared in answer to questions that his re
moval was brought about by the legal
and judicial -'tools" of the Bunker Hill
mine and the Standard Oil Company.
The witness presented a photography
taken at the time of the outbreak of 1892.-
It showed the front of a saloon at Gem,
with the glass windows riddled with rifle
shots. These, he testified, were made by
"Pinkertons and thugs brought in by the
mining companies to put down the union
men." - Most ' oi Stlmson's. testimony re
lated to minor circumstances in the affair
under investigation.
An exciting controversy occurred at the
afternoon session of the Coeur d'Alene in
vestigation, when the petition to the Sec
retary of War from several hundred citi
zens of the Coeur d'Alene district asking
for the retention of Federal troops was
presented in evidence. Representative
Sulzer denounced the petition as "bogus
and fraudulent," declaring that many of ;
the signatures were forgeries and that
other names had been secured by intimi
dation. He asked to introduce affidavits
attacking the petition, but after an ani
mated controversy these were ruled' out,
the vote being on party lines..
A motion by Sulzer calling on the Presi
dent for affidavits bearing on the petition
was similarly voted down by the commit
tee. ' - Â¦
Sulzer sharply commented on the course
of the majority, and his exchanges with
acting Chairman Marsh were at times
personal and emphatic. Sulzer and Capron
also had several wordy colloquies.
Dr. Hugh France, who Is regarded as an
important witness, since he acted as Cor
oner when the Bunker Hill mill was blown
up, and shared with Bartlett Sinclair in
the direction of affairs following that
event, was put on the stand. Dr. France
paid he was graduated from Bellevue Hos
pital. New York. He denied being in the
employ of the Bunker Hill mine, as had
been alleged, and said he,. was chosen by
the miners as "their physician and sur
geon, receiving his pay/from them. He
'described the warfare between the union
and non-union men, culminating with the
march on the Bunker Hill and the dyna
miting of the concentrator. Dr. France
defended the work of the Coroner's jury
against criticisms made during the testi
mony and explained the regularity of the
various steps taken. His testimony will
proceed to-morrow. Â¦ .
HANNA WILL NOT BE
NATIONAL CHAIRMAN
Some Other Republican to Manage

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 16.â 1t is rery
generally understood by leading Repub
lican politicians that Senator Hanna will
not be chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee during the coming cam
paign. There is no one in whom the
President or party leaders generally
would have more confidence than Senator
Hanna, but the state of his health .Is such
that he does not feel equal to assuming
the responsibility for the management of
the campaign. ' ,
First Assistant Postmaster General
Heath is one of ;the most talked of men
as Senator Hanna' s successor. Repre
sentative Dick of Ohio, who is the present
secretary of the National Committee, is
also spoken of for the place. Neither Mr.
Heath nor Mr. Dick will say that he is
anxious to take the work of the chair
manship, and although one of them prob
ably will be drafted into service, it will
be impossible to say which will be the
man until the new chairman has been
chosen at the Philadelphia convention, je*
Mr. McKlnley will be consulted and his
wishes as to his campaign manager will
be respected by the committee. .. Senator
Hanna will â¢ occupy, the position of gen
eral advisor to the chairman, whoever he
may be. â ' ?

$1,000,000 to file a report of their affairs, with
the Secretary of State. ,
4. Providing the process of Injunction against

5. Prohibiting the use of the mails tn con

tion he has taken in the United States
Senate in standing for the retention of
the capital of Alaska at Sltka. It is
stated in the protest that the desires of
the " people of Alaska and 'of Skaguay
were expressed in the territorial conven
tion last fall 'as favoring Juneau for the
capital. The protest states ; further:
"It must.be also within.y our personal
knowledge that the whole .of Southeast
ern' Alaska, with the exception of Sltka,
favors the removal of the capital to Ju
neau and that your position in regard to
the same is . in direct ; opposition to the
will , of the people of this whole section.
"Under these circumstances it is scarce
ly possible to' disassociate your public po
sition" as Senator from your private posi
tion as head of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company, and we must, therefore,
regard 'the latter as Â¦ representing inter
ests which are Inimical to those of this
port and Southeastern Alaska, and act
accordingly.'! .-..-.

the State, therefore, was the real party

Westminster confession of faith. He
paid: "We ought to have a new confes
sion of faith. It is surprising that the
Presbyterian church is able to do as much
as it is doing with such an incubus
strapped upon us as we are tottering
under in our present confession. In the
iirst place the thing needed is not a sys
tem of theology, for that is what our
present confession is. but a simple, bnei
Saxon statement of a half dozen of the
vital ingredients of Jesus Christ s mes
sage to the world."
If Rev Dr C H. Parkhurst s sermon
in which he assailed the confession of
faith of the Presbyterian church has oc
casioned astonishment among his fellow

they decline to admit it and it is improb

MINER MEETS WITH A
MOST PECULIAR DEATH
Struck on the Head and Killed by a
Rock That Had Been Blown Out
; of Sight by a Blast. 'â¢'; ~ .
REDDING, April 16.â One of the most
peculiar accidents ever occurring In ex
trerrie Northern California took place at
Round Mountain this afternoon, resulting
in the death of S. J. Halpin. The victim
was employed by the Terry Lumber Com
pany at the new mill forty miles east of
Redding. With other workmen he was
preparing a way' for a lumber chute. A
large stump had to be blasted out of the
path. The work was assigned to Halpin
and one companion. He placed an extra
heavy charge of powder and, retiring fully
1000 feet, stepped behind a large tree.
After the discharge the two men started
toward camp, it being near the supper
hour. They had proceeded fully 200 feet,
when a large rock, which must have been
blown out of sight, descended on Halpin,
killing him instantly and crushing his
head into a pulp.
Halpin was a well-known miner The
Irony of fate was exemplified In his case.
He was employed at the Iron Mountain
mine at the time of the recent disaster,
resulting In the death of eight men. He
quit work then, saying he would give up
mining, as he did not care to meet such
a death as his companions. Shortly there
after he secured the position where he
met his peculiar death.

WASHINGTON, April 16.â The Supreme Court to-day decided a case In
volving the stamp tax as it applies to express packages. The question in
volved Is whether the shipper or carrier shall pay the tax on the express
packages. The opinion was handed down by Justice White and was ravor
able to the express company. There were two cases before the court In
volving the question at issue, but the opinion was based upon the case of
the American Express Company vs. Attorney General Maynard of the btate^
of Michigan. . It came to the Supreme Court from a decision of the State bu
preme Court of Michigan, which decision was adverse to the claims of the.
express companies. The opinion to-day reversed that decision.
Regarding the decision of the Supreme Court Attorney General Ford of
California said to-night:
â¢ "As 1 understand the opinion of the court from hearing It outlined by
Justice White I fear there is not much comfort in it for California: The
Michigan case gave me considerable hope, but the New York .case seems to
lay down rules that 'under the present state of the law express companies
may shift the burden of tax without violating any of the provisions of the
statute- I have not yet had an opportunity to study the opinion Itself and
what I now say is based on my understanding of Justice White's statement
in open court to-day. So far as California is concerned I can only say that
I shall continue to press our suit against the express comapny to a final
and, I hope, successful conclusion."

A Few Valuable Hints to Those Who
Are Quick to Take Advantage of
Timely Suggestions.
Just now the advertising space of the
average newspaper is filled with advertise-
ments of springtime medicines, blood pu-
rifiers, etc. When It Is understood as a
scientific truth that the kidneys, liver and
lungs are the only blood purifiers of the
human body, much disappointment and
money will be saved. Dizziness palpita-
tion, languid feeling, headache, backache,
etc., are caused by the system being poi-
soned by uric acid, which the kidneys,
through overwork or weakness, do not
eliminate. The troubles mentioned are but
symptoms. The cauae lies deeper. Put the
kidneys and liver in working order with
that vegetable specific. Warner's Safe
Cure, and the symptoms and attendant
troubles will disappear. With the system
In first-class condition and the great or-
gans of life doing the work nature In-
tended them to do. most diseases are
thrown off. It is the weakened, debili-
tated, poisoned body which falls an easy
prey to chills, fevers, pneumonia, con-
sumption, Bright'a disease and death. No
man or woman can afford to be laid, up
with a severe illness. It Is the part of
wisdom to keep well. Miss Florence Buf-
fum, secretary of the Ishwara Theosoph-
lcal Society of Minneapolis, understands
this, perfectly, and under date of January
24 last write*}: "I have found Warner's
Safe Cure of high value. It greatly as-
sists a wornout system to perform its du-
ties, and whenever any of my friends be-
come languid or pale and full of pains I
advise them to try Warner's Safe Cure,
feeling assured that they will be satisfied
Â¦with the result;" Miss Buff urn's experi-
ence can be yours. Will you not also en-
joy It?

BOSTON, April 15.â Rev. Puxrkwell
Claacy. a missionary at Allahabad,
Â¦who ii visiting his brother in Med
forfi, said to-<ia.y:
The condition of famine-stricker,
I-dia to-<iay is something awful to con
t*â-,'a.te I cannot tell anything about
the number dying, but when I left Bom
bay last February there were some â¬0.Â«0,
0CO people suffering and over 30.000,000 were
in dire distress, and of these but 5,000.000
were receiving Government aid.
"It is not the cities but the country
1 places which are stricken, and when you
know that it is mostly among the agricul
tural classes and that SO per cent of the
population of India Is made up of tillers
of the soil you may be able to grasp in
some slight manner the extent of the suf
fering at the present time.
""When the famine set in the people be
gan to sell everything they had that they
might get a little grain food. They took
the doors from their houses and sold
them, sold their furniture and farming
utensils, and then when they had no
longer anything to sell they sold their
children. The boys don't sell well and the
traffic is largely In girls.
"I saw girls in one town Just before I
cÂ£me away being sold for 30 cent3 apiece.
They were bought up by Mohammedans.
But they won't buy the boys, so when the
r? rents can no longer support their chil
dren they abandon them, and henceforth
they must get on as best they can. These
crstoffs congregate about the doors of
the grain merchants* shops and the only
wjiv the proprietors can get rid of them
LÂ« to throw out handfuls of grain, scatter
ing it wide. The children pick and pick,
al! day. and at night perhaps are reward
ed by having collected a single handful."

to fig-it is the least likely to be called upon to
io so. The best peac* conference is & strong

world over as the strength of a great nation.
We are building a navy to maintain our for

to guard the proposed Nicaragua canal, which
I trust will never be built unless the American
navy has the right, aa It has the ability, to

While protection to ourselves was the watch
word of the past century, commerce will be

but at the same time we will build, aa we
have been bulldinz recently, ships for Japan
and Russia acd In time, by reason of the
decreased supply of inn and steel in other
countries, we will be buildine the navle* ot
England. France. Germany and the other great

Men will not embark In commercial enter

thus play an Important part in tecurinz our

in the civilization of the Filipinos. He
continued:

Toss Explains the BUI.
Some difficulty arose In connection with
the attempts to secure an agreement for
closing general debate. Foss. acting chair
man cf the Naval Committee, svggested
seven hours on a side. Underwood cf Ala
bama and Wheeler of Kentucky thought
there should be some general debate on
the live topics raised in the bill when read
ior amendment. This was especially true.
Underwood thought, regarding the ques
tion of armor plate. That question had
been vexing Congress for several years
an<2 !t was important that it should be
settled and 6Â«tt!ed right. All efforts to
tecur.e an agreement failed and the House
went into conunittee of the whole. Payne

EARLY HEARING
FOR KENTUCKY'S
ELECTION CASES
The United States Supreme
Court Names April 30 as
the Day.
Counsel for Both Taylor and Beck
ham Appeal to the Justices
Against Undue
volving the Kentucky Governorship were ''
docketed in the United States Supreme
Court to-day. A brief in which the coun
sel for Taylor and Beckham joined was
filed at the same time asking for an early
hearing. In this agreed statement it ia
set forth that both Taylor and Beckham
as Governor, John Marshal as Lieutenant
Governor on the Republican side and L.
H. Carter as President pro tern, of the
Senate and John B. Castleman as Adju
tant General on the Democratic side are
each and all claiming the right to and
actually attempting to exercise the pow
ers of the respective offices severally
claimed by them, thus producing great
confusion in Kentucky by reason of
doubts as to which of the persons named
has the lawful right to exercise the au
thority pertaining to the several offices
named, all to the great injury and detri
ment of the people of the State.
Bruce presented a statement of- facts
and the court set the case for a hearing
on the 30th inst., granting each side four
hours for argument. While Bruce was
making his statement the Chief Justice
asked him if he did not expect the ques
tion of jurisdiction to be raised and
whether he did not expect a motion to
dismiss. Bruce replied both were prob
able, but there was such confusion in the
State that all were anxious for a decision
during the present term of court, and the
course undertaken was the only one prac
ticable. He added:
"If the court should sustain the motion
to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction that re
sult would, -of course, end the contro
versy. If the opinion on such motion
should be adverse to dismissal It would
probably be too late to hear the case on
Its merits."
After Bruce concluded this statement
the case was assigned. -?â¢ t

the prisoners took no unusual action. It

owing to the presence of a recent arrival
in the person of J. F. \V. Davis, a noto

a slight pretext. The watch was then re

nel Wins Easily at
15 to 1.
It almost surpasses belief to think that
all of the uncouth exhibitions of jockey
thlp witnessed day after day at Tan
foran Park are due to incompetency. It
requires a wide stretch of imagination to
figure out how Hosormonde and Constel
lator could be easily beaten at a mile cov
ered in 1:43U,. Still such a thing hap
pened. In the third ovent Mortgage.
Itosormonde, ConsteUator and Flamora
furr.lshcd Quite a betting affair, with the
first named lilly the favorite. Flamora re
fused to break and was left. Mortgage
went out in the lead, stepping the first
quarter in :2S, with Ames astride Rosor
xnonde and Mounce on the Boots colt tak
ing their mounts back. When the stretch
was reached both had been choked to
death and Mortgage walked home. Each
of the riders mentioned should be sent to
pome institution for refractory youths,
for their place is not in the saddle.
This was one of many shoddy rides
which can be viewed race after race.
Only two first choices managed to strug
gle to the rla.te in advance of their fields,
and the talent seemed thankful for even
this slight offering.
The first event, a five and a half furlong
selling run. was a veritable Cakewalk for
May Gertrude. Nealon's fast filly closed
a 7 to 10 favorite, and running over Kitty
Kelly through the strttch won in a gal
lop. March Seven, a5O to 1 shot, finished
third.
Twelve Ptarted in the kindergarten
event, with Scotch Belle ruling a 11 to 5
favorite. She k-d into the stretch and
then fell back. Chaste looked a winner to
within a few yards cf the wire, where
lvOgue on the 9 to 1 chance Irate came
with a rush under punishment, scoring by
a head. Show honors fell to Girly Ducat,
a 30 'to 1 shot.
Corrigan's mare Chimura was returned
winner of the mile and a furlong run,
starting a 6 to 5 favorite. Trailing old
Captive into the stretch fhe assumed con
trol, leading out Gauntlet in a drive. Op
ponent, the second choice, ran fourth.
Sly, if his showing in the six-furlong
pprint is any criterion, has gone back
frightfully. Dan Hanion's fast mare ruled
favorite, and though Ross beat the gate
with her. he took her back, and she never
after looked dangerous. True Blue, at
odds of 7 to 2. won galloping from Cormo
rant.
Then followed the unexpected win of
Morincl in the closing mile selling affair.
Coming from away back in the .stretch,
the little mare beat Donator and the fa
vorite Catastrophe in a gallop.

PUGILIST SLATER IS
STABBED IN THE BACK
Charles Slater, a prize-fighter, was
stabbed and fatally wounded last night by
an unknown man at the corner of Eddy
and Taylor streets. According to Slater's
story he was seated In a box at the Olym
pia Theater when two men, one of whom
is named Henry Donnelly, proceeded to
abuse him. Slater invited the pair into
the street, after threatening to send them
to the hospital. Donnelly, it Is claimed,
passed his companion a knife and prompt
ly acepted Slater's defiance. After the
trio reached the street Slater proceeded
to carry out his contract, when Donnelly's
companion lost courage and started up
Eddy street. Slater followed them, and at
Taylor street the man with the knife sud
denly wheeled around and stabbed the
prize-fighter in the back, the blade pene
trating his lung. After being cut Slater
struck Donnelly on the Jaw, knocking him
out. He tried to reach the man who had
stabbed him. but the latter took to his
heels and disappeared up Eddy street.
Slater started to. follow him, but fell
from the -loss of blood. Policeman Cole
man happened along at this Juncture, and
after having tho wounded man sent to the
Receiving Hospital went In search of Don
nelly and his companion. He found the
former within a short distance of the
scene of the cutting and. took him Into
custody. Up to a late. hour last night his
companion was not arrested. The sur
geons at the hospital express little hope
of Slater's recovery.
Donnelly, when questioned. â¢ admitted
that he had met Slater in the Olympia, but
denied that there was any trouble be
tween them. He also declared that he had
not passed his knife to, the assailant of
the prize-fighter, as the police claim. He
was locked up in "the tanks" pending
further investigation.
Policemen Coleman and Harrlgan, late
last night arrested Jack Urady as the
man who did the cutting. Brady admitted
that he ntabbed Slater, but claimed he
acted in self-defense. He was charged at
the City Prison with assault to commit
murder and a similar charge was placed
against Donnelly. ' , V,-

WILL LANGE
WEDS A BELLE
Impressive Ceremony at
St. Dominic's Last Even
ing Followed by a
Home Reception.
3T. DOMINIC'S CHURCH was
crowded with a fashionable assem
blage last evening to witness the
nuptials of Miss Grace Anna Glsel
man and William Alexander Lange.
The romantic attachment which culmin
ated in the ceremony last evening, the
well-known position in society of the bride
and the great popularity of the groom
attracted many to the church who were
not formally bidden to the wedding.
Pink and white blossoms arranged in
honor of the occasion made the church
beautiful, and countless white tapers lit
up the altar. Father Rourke, friend of
the bride and groom, officiated at the im
pressive ceremony.
To the strains of the wedding march
from "Lohengrin" the bridal party moved
to the altar. First came an altar boy
bearing a pillow, on which reposed the
wedding ring, and Immediately following
him were two other altar hoys bearing in
their arms long-stemmed St. Joseph lilies.
After the altar boys marched the six ush
ers, Frank H. Kerrigan, H. L. Day, N.
H. Eaton, J. M. Sullivan, W. McLaln and
James P. Sweeney. Miss Olivia M. Ver
don, maid of honor, preceded the bride,
who closed the procession leaning on the
arm of her father. Charles Lange, broth
er of the groom, officiated as best man.
The bride looked charming in a mag
nificent gown of cream-white satin. The
corsage was trimmed with a yoke of
shirred tulle and spray of orange blos
soms. The jupe was made en train and
perfectly plain.
Miss Verdon, the maid of honor, wore a
dainty gown of pink tulle over pink silk,
and Mrs. Giselir.an, the mother of the
bride, was attired In an elegant Parisian
gown of embroidered white silk over an
underdress of cerise tulle ruffles, orna
mented with garlands of roses.
Pretty features of the church ceremony
were the music, composed especially for
the occasion by Professor Robert Harri
son, and the reading Immediately at the
conclusion of the ceremony of the cable
gram conveying the congratulations of
the bride's brother, who is studying music
in I^ondon.
At the reception, which followed the
ceremony, at the residence of the bride's
parents. 1720 Golden Gate avenue, three
hundred guests were present. The pres
ents received by the young couple were
numerous and elaborate. Prominent
among the gifts was a complete set of
silver sent by the National League. Mr.
find Mrs. Lange are going south for a
bridal trip and on their return they will
take up their residence in the new house
being built for them adjoining the resi
dence of the bride's parents.
William Lange. the happy groom, Is
widely and popularly known as an ex
member of the Chicago baseball team. He
was considered one of the best fielders and
base runners in the profession, but retired
from the diamond when his engagement
to Miss Giselman was announced. It is
said his retirement was due to a request
from the lady who last evening became
his wife, and although many splendid of
fers have since been made him to again
re-enter the profession he has declined all.
Mr. Lange is now in the real estate and
insurance business.
Mrs. Lange is the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. William Giselman. and since her
debut.. in society has been a recognized
belle.
to box three rounds with his wife. Of
course, Al does not attempt to annihilate
her, but on several occasions he has had
to check her ardor by landing his gloved
hand on her head or body.
Mrs. Neill thinks it is not unwomanly
to engage in boxing. She says that It
has not only taught her how to protect
herself from Insult, but has made her
more agile on her feet and strengthened
her' considerably. In discussing the sub
ject yesterday she said:
"I have been a lover of athletics all my
life. When I was 7 years old I could
swim and dive. I have always been out
doors, taking long walks with my father
and friends, rowing boats or cycling. I
tralian he will wear it and carry the stars
and stripes to victory."
Al is training hard for his bout. He is
being handled by "Jack" Sullivan and Is
already in the pink of condition. He boxes
every afternoon with "Big" Russell, Fred
Muller and Toby Irwin, and no lovo taps
are exchanged. The young Callfomian
is a glutton for work and seems to never
tire. He claims that he Is hitting harder,
blocking better and Is faster on his feet
than he ever was in his career as a boxer.
Murphy is working hard at the Casino
and Is reported to be in splendid condi
tion. Experts who have seen him perform
look upon him aa a dangerous opponent
for Neill.

Kvery morning I accompany him on my

in the afternoon I watch him at work

"Do I think he will defeat his English

port will be made of the league' s investigations
of several municipal ownership plants which
were made on the suggestion of the National
Electric Light Association. Mayor Phelan is
one cf the honorary vice presidents of the
leagu#.
A resolution Introduced by McCarthy was re
ferred to the Board of Works for advice, and
is Intended to regulate contracts on behalf
of the city In relation to the erection, re
pair and alteration of public buildings. In It
the Board of Publtc Works Is Instructed, when
calling for bids and awarding contracts for
the erection, repair or alteration of any build
ing or structure under its supervision, to call
for separate bids and award separate contracts
for each cf the main elements of the building
or structure, and to always segregate the
work to be done and the contracts to be award
ed as much as possible to the end that each
contractor may be under bond to and be re
sponsible to said Board of Public Works.
An opinion of the City Attorney was read
In which he holds that the delinquent tax
llct is part of the official advertising. As such
the charter provides that it Is to be published
in a daily newspaper that has a bona fide cir
culation of at least SOCO ' copies and has been
In existence for two years at the time of let
ting the contract to the lowest xesponslble bld-
The ordinance imposing an increased license

The ordinance making It a misdemeanor to

ferred to the City Attorney.
The Board of Public Works was directed to

used cistern at Clay and Taylor streets at a
cost of $1000. the work to be postponed, if pos
sible, until next July.
The Judiciary and License Committees were
directed to frame a general resolution on the
question of special permits or privileges so
that the Board of Public Works may be guided
in Its granting of such applications.
Official Communications.
The following communications from publtc
officials were read: From Mayor Phelan.
recommending the appointment of a citizens
committee, and the appropriation of JoOO, for
the celebration of Decoration day: City Attor
ney stating that the Board of Public Works
is the only body having the authority to allow
the moving of buildlnss; also the charter pro
vision exacting that all railways wishing tn
enter the city to have fifty miles of track is
untenable In law; Board of Public Works,
stating that . the Fire Commissioners have
a?ked for an apprcprlaticn to be made in the
next tax levy for the erection of new fire
houses; also recommending the granting of
private contracts for street work.
Referred to Committees.
The following petitions, protests, etc., were
referred to committees:
San Francisco Pressmen's Union, protesting
against the passage of the anti-bill posting
ordinance; Sunnyside Improvement Club, peti
tioning for the extension of Jarnac street to
San Jose avenue; Ann E. Reynolds, protestlnsr
against the proximity of the Cnion-street cable
tracks to the sidewalk; C. L. Dall. asking that
the pound limits be extended so as to Include

ance of the following street work was adopted:

from Folsom street south to Its termination;
Union street, between Franklin and Gough:
crossing of Fan Jose avenue; Twenty-eighth and
Guerrero streets; Eighteenth street, between
Dolores and Church; crossing of Eighteenth and
Church streets; Shrader street, between Hayes
and Fell, and Gough street, between Jackson
street and Pacific avenue.
cided that the ordinance was discrimina
tory and invalid. Judge Seawell held in
tnat case that an ordinance which dis
criminated between the height of fences
erected "for advertising purposes" ana
other fences was invalid as a police regu
lation, there being no sufficient ground
for such distinction. There is nothing es
sentially unhealthful, nor is there any
thing necessarily objectionable as inter
fering with proper fire regulations In a
fence simply because it is erected or
maintained for advertising purposes.
"Inasmuch as the bill under considera
tion," says the opinion, "purports by its
title to regulate advertising any ordinance
that you may pass directed at the height
of fences alone should be by separatt.
Section 3 of the ordinance, which pro
vides that "where permission is given by
the Board of- Supervisors or Board of
Works to erect obstructions of any char
acter on the streets it shall be unlawful
to paint, paste or write any bill, notice or
announcement or any advertising device,''
Is held to be valid by the City Attorney.
He says that It Is competent for the board
in granting such permits to attach any
reasonable condition thereto.
Section 3 is In the following language:
It shall be unlawful for any person, company
or corporation to drive or cause to be driven
on the streets of the city and county of San
Francisco, any wagon or vehicle carrying ad
vertisements, unless owned by a storekeeper or
other person dolrg business In the city and
county of San Frantlsco at a fixed place of
business, and used for the regular delivery of
goods soIJ by said storekeeper, or other per
son doing business as aforesaid; to propel
any street cars on the rtreets of the city and
county of San Francisco, having advertise
ments printed, pasted or painted en the out
side of the said cars; to appear on the streets
of the city and -county of San Francisco carry
ing banners, or boards, or placards containing
advertising: matter; to. appear or walk on the
streets of the city and county of San Fran
cisco, attracting or attempting to attract at
tention to advertising matter by extraordinary
or unusual costume or dress, or by playing on
musical Instruments or by making any unusual
noise.
"Probably the most practical way of
dealing with the matters embraced in this
section is by permit to be issued by the
Board of Public Works under a general
ordinance of the Supervisors. The charter
provides that the Board of Public Works
shall have charge, superintendence and
control, under the ordinances of the
Board of Supervisors, of all public streets
and of their use, and shall have exclusive
authority to grant permits for the using
of the street - for any purpose other than
such as ordinarily and properly belongs
to the public from the dedication thereof
to public use.' The use of the streets for
advertising purposes is an extraordinary
use, not one such as ordinarily belongs to
the public. The Board of Supervisors may
therefore pass ordinances regulating the
use of the streets 'for advertising pur
poses,' the streets being completely with
in public control and the object of their
dedication being primarily for purposes of
travel and personal passage. The Board
of Supervisors may deny altogether the
right to use the street in such manner as
to congest traffic or make passage thereon
dangerous. And to this end may prohibit
the use of the street to advertising
schemes and devices, such as the section
Indicates. Whether the ordinance so pro
vides, or not, it is to me plain that no
business house can be deprived of the
right to place Its name and place of busi
ness, or other identifying mark, upon its
wagon or carriage, hut this would not In
my judgment be using the street for ad
vertising purposes."
The section uiohlbiting the distribution
of any handbills or dodgers on the streets
or the maintenance of any signs upon the
Ptreets or sidewalks, or any electrical sign
Is held to be valid. The opinion concludes:
By way of recapitulation, I would say that
as section 1 of the form proposed has virtually
been passed upon adversely by Judge Seawell
in the case mentioned and also by the Supreme
Court of another State, it is undesirable in Its
present form. I have no doubt, however, that
such matters as are really objectionable In that
connection are correctable by ordinance In
proper form. As to section 3, the- only prac
tical way to accomplish your purposes, so' far
as I can see. Is by permit. As to sections 2,
4 and S. , I am of the opinion that the form
thereof Is sufficient as submitted.
McCarthy introduced a resolution calling
the attention of the Tax Collector to the
fact that the statute imposing a license of
5100 per month on quack doctors had never
been enforced, and directing him to carry
out the provisions of the section in point.
The "fake practitioners" came in for a
severe scoring from Boxton, who was
prompted by the application of n dental
concern -to operate a sign in front of Its
place of business, which was denied. The

SUPERVISOR MCCARTHY made an
earnest appeal to his associates on
the Board of Supervisors when his
order "prohibiting telephone com
panies from charging or receiving any
compensation for service before the
party or number called for re
sponds" came up for final passage at
yesterday's meeting-. It was only after
over an hour's discussion, participated In
by McCarthy and Reed on the one side
and John I. Sabin, president of the Pacific
Telephone Company, on the other, and
after three votes had been taken on the
measure, that it was defeated. Those
who voted to relieve a long-suffering
public from the exasperating service to
which it has long been subjected were:
Booth, Comte, D'Ancona, Hotaling, Ma
gulre, McCarthy, Reed and Tobln. The
noes were Boxton, Brandenstein, Connor,
Curtis. Dwyer, Helms, Jennings and San
derson. The vote stood eight to eight,
Duboce and Fontana being absent. Bran
denstein, however, gave notice of recon
sideration, saying that he desired the
matter thoroughly gone into, and request
ing the presence of -the representatives of
the telephone company, City Engineer
Grunsky and Chief Electrician Hewitt at
the next meeting.
When the measure was first taken up
Connor said that he was opposed to the
order because he considered it a great in
justice to the telephone company. Mc-
Carthy replied that the order would work
no hardship and would only necessitate
the employment of a few more operators.
"The telephone company," said McCar
thy, "has over IS.OOO BUbscriberr. and
charges outrageous rents for its machines.
The people, who are the main sufferers,
expect this ordinance to pass, and If It
does not It will be a disappointment to
many thousands who are asking for re
lief."
President Sabln then read a long com
munication in which he represented that
the provisions of the order could not be
carried out without doubling the number
of operators. He contended that it would
be an injustice to the party called for to
subject the calling party to the delay in
exacting the nickel after connection was
made. He promised that the company
would do one of three things in case the
party could not be raisedâ to call up the
number at intervals during twenty-four
hours, to secure another number or to
credit the caller with a nickel on the
books. He said that it was on the strength
of these representations that the Mayor
had vetoed the former order passed by
the last board.
Reed then asked Sabin how much it
would cost to comply with the order, and
he replied $75,000 per year.
"Are you willing to tell us the gross or
net profits of your concern?" said Reed,
and Sabin answered that he could not tell.
Reed suggested that It might be 51.000,000,
and McCarthy said that Mr. Lehigh of
the company had stated that 80,000
switches a day were given, which, at 5
cents each, would reach the enormous to
tal income of 51.5u0.000 a year. To this
Sabin said that Lehigh.dld not know what
he was talking about, and neither did Su
perintendent Glass when he said that it
would take COO extra operators if the or
der becamo a law.
"What proportion of the total expenses
is that 5*5.000?" ventured Reed, who be
lieves in municipal ownership of tele-
P '-i" will have to consult my attorney,"
replied Sabin. who by this time had be
come thoroughly warmed up.
Brandenstein moved to postpone consid
eration, which was lost by a vote of 9 to
7 the Mayor holding that the charter re
quired a majority vote of ten. Branden
stein then appealed from the Mayor s de
cision, and caused some amusement when
he took his stand behind Cushing's Man
ual, which he seemed to regard as supe
rior to the charter. The ruling of the
chair was sustained. however, only
Brundensteln, Curtis and Dwyer voting
Another motion to defer action for two
weeks was los*t by the same vote as the
other; on final passage the measure was
defeated, and then Brandenstein s notice
to reconsider prevailed.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion re
garding the bill-posting ordinances. Of
the four bills submitted he selected the
longest and most comprehensive and dis
cussed it in sections. With regard to
section 1, which prohibits the mainte
nance of a fence or building over ten feet
in height for the purpose of painting
thereon any sign or advertising or posting
thereon any bills, signs, etc., for. adver
tising purposes. Mr. Lano holds that there
is now an ordinance covering substantial

Hot Vapor, or' Medicated Bath, with no possl-
sleeplessness with which he had lons suffered.

flicted.

efit. No Christian should be without it." Hon.
V. C. Hay. St. Joe, Mo., writes: "Physicians
gave me up to die; was persuaded by friends
to try this Cabinet, and it cured me. I cannot
praise It enough." Rev. Baker Smith, D. D..
Fairmont. N. J.. says: "Your Cabinet rids the

Into the. Case.

Out in the Scheme.
won out in Ttoth engagements, the second
In ing a half-hearted compromise, that
was virtually a victory*
Through it all Bimpton sat stolid, indif
ferent and unaffected by anything said or
done. Later on he admitted that lie told
heavy packs of lies, all for the purpose
of lending an assisting hand to Sylva,
who engineered the business.
Simpton Corrects Himself.
The case opened with the continuation
of the argument on the right of the re
spondents' attorneys to inquire into the
inducement which led Simpton to make
the affidavit of August 12. Sandwiched
in between this argument and citation of
cases by McEnerney came an unexpected
leijucst'from Simpton to correct testimony
given last Thursday.
"In r*-gard to my first meeting with Mr.
Sylva." said Simpton, "I have some cor
rections to make- In my testimony. I
thought that it was in the latter part of
July, but on further recollection it was
two days before I met Mrs. Craven for
the first time, which was on August 5."
Lafe Ponce then asked the witness
whom he had seen in the meantime and
with whom Me had talked the matter
over. Simpton admitted that he met Syl
va. ns was his daily custom, but dis
claimed any conversation with him in
which the case was mentioned.
McEnerney Wins His Point.
jr ONO arsiimer.ts on the law of evi
dence wore Injected Into the Fair
Â£__- case yesterday, slightly relieving
a tiresome redirect examination of
Judge Shr.pton. who passed his third du,v
upon the witness stand. Stephen and
Greenleaf wore thrown about the court
room as peps upon which to hang the at
torneys' arguments, and these authorities
were supplemented by numerous Instances
of case law, all of which were cited and
read for the edification of Judge Troutt
and the somnolence of the crowd.
Late in the afternoon, just before the
court adjourned. McEnerney arose and
asked Lafe Pence:
"Do the attorneys of the petitioner claim
outside of the alleged solemnized mar
riage 'that James G. Fair was married to
Mrs. Craven?"
"We most certainly do." was the imme
diate answer. And then Charles E. Stew
art, accountant and bookkeeper of the
Fair estate, was put upon the stand and a
row phase of the case begun.
Judge Troutt played yesterday a more
important part in the game than during
many preceding days. He was called upon
to decide at least two questions as to the
admisfibUlty of evidence. The first ques
tion related to what was said and done by
Sylva In bis efforts to induce the witness
to act the part of the marriage broker
end draw up the affidavit of August 1~.
The second debate was upon thÂ« right of
McEnerrey to seek the motive V>ack of
Bimpton's false swearing. McEnerney
Scheme of Sylva.
"Whn.t conversation took place between
you and Sylva in regard to the execution
of the letter of August S?"
"He said: 'We will send the letter over
to Mr. Foote and make him believe we
will go on the stand and testify for Mrs.
Craven.'. Simpton also said that Sylva ad
vised him to make reporters and all with
whom he came in contact believe that the
first Btory was the truth."
"Did you Bee Sylva before you swore
to the affidavit of the 12th?"
"Yes. I said to him. "Mr. Foote wants
1 me to make an affidavit and I don't want
to do it. I would never be able to show
my face in Sausalito again." Svlva said he
! h*d looked up the law and It would bt>
! all right for me to do so and that ht
Â¦would not ask me to do anything that
was r.ot honorable."
Simpton wasn't satisfied with this, and
I during a lull in the proceedings he added:
j "Rylva paid also that if I didn't make the
. affidavit somebody else would and then
j we couldn't trap the woman."
Motive Is the Point.
The letter of August B, sent to "W. "W.
Foote by Simpton, outlining the facts of
the alleged marriage ceremony, was the
next document- which was used by Mc-
Enerney to hang his redirect examination
upon.
"What was your motive?" interrogated
McEnerney, and the clouds of argument
I burst once more upon the court. Charles
Penoe argued that the question should
not be asked, because it called for a state
of mind. A compromise was effected un
der objection and the following question
was asked:
"What was your reason for writing the
letter of August S?"
"To lead them (Pence and Foote) into
the belief that I would go on the stand
and testify as they wanted," was the re
sponse.
Identical answers were given In the
matter of the affidavit and the Interviews
with reporters; also In regard to his
statement to the Pences that he knew
Mrs. Craven when he was monarch of a
streetcar and Senator Fair In the bo
nanza days.
McEnerney finished his redirect exam
ination of the witness and Simpton was
pruned back to Lafe Pence for a recross
fusillade. The change In testimony con
cerning the first meeting with Sylva fur
nished a linp of questions. Simpton would
not positively say whether or not he re
membered if Sylva said to him after
Thursday's proceedlnprs that his testimony
about the first meeting must be changed
from the last part of July to August 3.
The last question asked by Pence was:
"Mr. Simpton. were you an honest man up
to February 13. 1599?" That was the date
of the renegade event. "Yes, sir; I was,"
was the answer.
Expert Testimony Begun.
Charles E. Stewart, accountant and
bookkeeper of the Fair estate, was then
fworn. He swore that he had seen Sena
tor Fair write in his lifetime, was
familiar with his signature and knew It
well. Checks on the Nevada Bank were
handed the witness and the signature was
identified. Mr. Crothers, who will conduct
this end of the rase, offered the papers
us samples of handwriting of Senator
Fair's signature.
The case will be resumed to-day at 11
a. m., expert testimony being in order.
When McEnerney had finished his cita
tion of judicial decisions Charles Pence
made his little speech; which was follow
ed by a long argument from Lufe Pence,
who "wanted to know if the Hood gates of
perjury were to l>e opened wide and the
strong* tide of infamy and falsehood were
to be allowed to roll on unchecked. When
the burst of oratory was concluded Ex
(Jovernor Budd seemed anxious to unbur
den himself "of many wise saws of legal
lore, but Judge Troutt nipped him at the
outset and decided that McEnerney
might ask the question.
"What did Mr. Sylva say to you?"
queried McEnerney, and the trial began
where it left off last Thursday afternoon.
"He asked me to come up to his house,
saying that Mrs. Craven had been over
to ee<? uf and told him that he had been
recommended to her because he had
power over the Justice of the Peace. He
said: 'Simpton, I have been a friend to
you, and now I want you to stand in with
me and trap these people because I am
a friend of the Fairs.' Then I told him
I would think the matter over."
"In that first conversation, did Sylva
tell you he wanted you to do anything?"
"Yes; that I should stand in with him
to trap her because the Fair friends were
his friends."
"When did this conversation occur?"
"Two days before the sth of August."
"Did you evrr have any other conversa
tion with Sylva about Mrs. Craven?"
"On the sth, when she appeared in Sau
salito."

FOOTLIGHT FAVORITE ENGAGED TO YOUNG SOCIETY MAN
c=Tj=3HE engagement of John S. Merrill to Miss Olive Snider was announced
publicly on Sunday afternoon. Friends of both parties have known of
J[ the attachment of the young couple for some months and the announce
. ment was unattended with any form of surprise.
1 Mr. Merrill is the son of John F. Merrill, of the firm of Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson. Since his graduation from the University of California a few
years ago he has been connected with his father's business, where he occupies
an important position. Miss Snider durinqr the past few years has been promi
nent not only in amateur theatricals but also as a singing soubrette at the
Tivoli, where she was known as Charlotte Beckwlth. She Is a young woman
of most striking beauty, both of face and figure.
Miss Snider* s progress in light opera was very rapid as soon as she was
given an opportunity by the Tivoli management. Her handsome figure, pret
ty face and well-trained voice made her a footlight favorite. The surprise
came when Miss Snider was left out of the cast of the "Idol's Eye," but this
was not due to any action on the part of the Tivoli management. At that
time the engagement between Mr. Merrill and Miss Snider was made and
the latter determined to end her stage career for all time.
There have been persistent rumors of a marriage of the young couple for
the last three months, but this is denied by both parties as well as by their
parents.Mothers give Dr. Slegert's Angostura Bitters

POST CHECK NOTES.
SENATOR McMILLAN of Michigan has in
troduced into the Senate, and Representative
Lentz in the House, bills providing for the is
sue of "post checks," for the convenience of the pub
lic in transmitting small amounts of money through
the mails. The measures have been framed in re
sponse to an urgent public demand. The present
postal order system by no means fills the require
ments of the time. It is costly and inconvenient, and,
moreover, does not serve all the purposes desired.
The two bills now before Congress are essentially
alike. They provide for the issuance of "United
States post check notes" in denominations of five
dollars, two dollars and one dollar, to replace the
entire issue of money represented by those amounts,
and fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) in fractional
notes, of fifty, twenty-five, fifteen, ten and five cent
denominations. Each note to contain blank spaces
for the name and address of the payee and his signa
ture and that of the person who sends it, such signa
ture to make it payable at the postoffice where the
payee resides, and transforming it into a check on the
United States Government, to be used the same as a
personal check or the present money order. In lieu
of the fee for issuing the note, a two-cent stamp for
notes of $1 or upward, or a one-cent stamp for notes
v of fractional parts of a dollar, to be affixed to each
note by the person using the same to transmit it
, through the mails. When redeemed the notes to be
reissued.
It will be seen that under the proposed system it
will not be necessary to go to the postoffice and make
out a blank application for a money order every
time a person wishes to send any sum from five cents
to five dollars through the mails with safety. The
person desiring to transmit the. money can take any
postal check in general circulation and use it for that
purpose. When once it has been indorsed in the
manner prescribed it will then be valueless for circu
lation and be payable oniy to the person to whom it
is drawn. Money transmitted in that way will be as
safe as if sent by a bank check or by express, or by
the present system of postal orders, while the con
venience and cheapness of it will be a vast improve
ment on either of the present methods of sending
small sums across the country.
The proposed reform being now fairly before Con
gress, it is to be hoped it will be taken up and enacted
at this session. It will be a measure of immediate
benefit to all, and it would be well for commercial
bodies to press upon Congressmen the importance of
providing the system as soon as possible.

DEWEY'S CANDIDACY.
THE offer of Admiral Dewey to take the Presi
dency has become of interest only by reason
of the casual rifts in the veil of mystery which
disclose the motives that induced it.
These motives are external to the Admiral. The
idea evidently did not originate with him, though it
found in him a congenial culture bed. This has
been true of a large number of able men, who
breathed in the Presidential microbe from the atmos
phere around them and were forever after changed
men. In some cases a nomination cures the disease.
But in no case has it ever disappeared when no nomi
nation was applied to it. There is reasonable ground
for the fear that in the Admiral's case the infirmity
will be chronic, since there appears but little prospect
that the nomination cure is possible.
It is known now that his candidacy is the result
of the straits of the Democratic party. Certain gold
Democrats who supported the Indianapolis platform
are anxious to eliminate the features of the "new
Democracy" brought into fantastic existence with the
advent of Mr. Bryan as the party leader. These gold
men want to get back into the organization, but they
cannot as long as they must accept the revolutionary
propositions of the Chicago platform. These gentle
men are reinforced by a very large contingent who ac
cepted the platform of 1896 and supported Bryan, be^
cause he was the regular candidate, and they preferred
not to break with the organization, but to stay with
it, hoping to see better days.
It must be admitted that among these are the best
politicians that were with Bryan in 1896. They are of
the class that support the ticket, pack lamps and en
courage the boys by shouting, though they may in
privacy cuss the candidate and roast the platform.
It must be said that Senator Jones, chairman of
Bryan's National Committee, and his managers, are
neither politicians nor statesmen. They belong to the
class of public men who think that things will occur
because they wish them to. They have neither fore
sight nor hindsight, nor do they see sidewise. In
fact, they don't see at all. They are superstitious and
expect to secure political results by conjuring.
Bryan suits them exactly. His idiotic optimism, his
oratorical prophecies, which never come true, the
numerous things he knows that are not so, seem to
suit them exactly. With them faith is that faculty
which enables them to believe what they know is not
true. They are pitied, feared and hated by the gold
Democracy and the politicians in the regular party,
and those two classes have combined to break the
spell by which they hold the organization in bond
age.
Out of this issues the candidacy of Dewey. The re
calcitrants in the Bryan camp and the gold Demo
crats, who want to get back and be regular, have got
together and wigwagged the Admiral, until he wig
wags back, thinking that the country is signaling for
him to come to its assistance. His name is to be used
at the Kansas City convention as a sponge to wipe
out the differences which split the party four years
ago. and after that those who have brought him out
don't care much what happens.
What will happen is already plain to men who heed
Patrick .Henry's advice against indulgence in the illu
sions of hope. No nominee of the Kansas City con
vention can be elected. The Chicago convention was
on a large scale a repetition of the Stockton conven
tion held in this State in 1884. which turned red-eyed
and used a cleaver to split the party from chin to
chine. Thousands of Democrats go on and pull
quietly until that tumultuous aggregation of dema
gogues is thought of, and they get mad and cease" to
pull or be quiet.
The American Democracy will never win until it is
born again, and in view of Colonel Bryan's injurious
volubility, the country will be glad to have it still
born, if possible.

STEPHEN WHITE ON THE TICKET.
Salt Lake Tribune.
It is said that Mr. Bryan favors ex-
Senator White of California for his run
ning mate in the coming campaign. We
think that is very natural. Ex-Senator
White is a bright man, a most lovable
man and he has been a righthand sup
porter of Mr. Bryan from the meeting of
the Chicago convention four years ago.
More than that, hl/< nomination might
carry- the State of California for Bryan,
and surely nothins else can. . -
Democrats, Silver Republicans and Populists are
striving to unite upon a running mate for William
Jennings Bryan. When the unfortunate is finally
chosen it would be interesting to know to just what
set of principles he is pledged.
Since the British are now agreed that what they
need most is army reform' they should bring their
army back from South Afrka and set to work. In
that 'way. they could reform themselves at the same
time with the army. , .'
CHINESE IMPORTATION FRAUDS
Alameda Encinal.
The more the Chinese importation busi
ness is looked into the dirtier does it be
come. It appears that upward of 3000
Chinese have been admitted by Collector
Jackson, all of whom claim that they
were born in this State, hundreds of
whom give the same building as their
birthplace and every one of whom re-r
markably enough left before July, ISS2*.
and are now returning for the first time.
The reason for this unanimity as to date
Is the fact that at that time the Govern
ment began to keep a record of every de
parting Chinese. On the face of it the
fraud is a glaring one, and unless blinded
by coin one can scarcely understand how
an officer could be so Ignorant as to ac
cept any such "evidence."
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
STEREOTYPE AND ELECTROTYPE
â C, Seattle, Wash. There were a num
ber of men at about the same time who
discovered the principles of stereotyping,
but the first to put it to practical use
was William Ged. a goldsmith of Edin
burgh, in 17i}. The discovery of electro
typing is credited to Thomas Spencer of
Liverpool in 17C9.
POLL TAXâ B. A. G.. City. The fart
that a man earns lesa than $12 a week
does not exempt him from the payment of
poll tax in California. The clause in the
constitution relative to that tax Is section
12 of article XIII. which says: "The Leg
islature shall provide for the levy and
collection of an annual poll tax of not
less than $2 on every male inhabitant of
thia State over 21 and under 60 years of
age. except paupers. Idiots, Insane persona
and Indiana not taxed."
ROAD AND OTHER TAXâ H. T.. Iron
Mountain. Cal. Poll and road tax paid in
one State dors not exempt an individual
from payment in another State. The fact
that a man served as a volunteer in the
army of the United States docs not ex
empt him from payment of poll tax In
California. As to road tax. that is a mat
ter of county legislation, and the Super
visors m'Kht exempt such soldiers from
payment of road tax. but the other as to
poll tax is a constitutional provision
which cannot be changed except by vote
of the people. *

THE GERMAN MERCHANT MARINE
ONE of the most interesting and valuable re
ports made by our Consuls for a long time
is that of Frank H. Mason, Consul General at
j Berlin, reviewing the rapid progress made by the
i Germans in building up an extensive merchant
marine, and setting forth the means by which the
j present great results have been attained. The report
j comes as a timely contribution to the discussion of
j the merchant marine bill now before Congress, and
' contains an important lesson for our lawmakers.
It is to Bismarck Germany owes the beginning| of
that wise and liberal legislation which has made her
I one of the foremost commercial nations on the globe.
I After the establishment of the imperial Government
1 Bismarck foresaw that the time would soon come
when Germany would change from an agricultural to
a manufacturing and commercial nation, and would
require a foreign market for her surplus products.
With his usual sagacity and vigor he set about pre
paring for one. and at once devised legislation to that
lend.
; In 1881 the Prince, who was then Chancellor of the
â¢ empire, submitted to the Reichstag a long and elabo
j rate memorial based upon a review of the French,
mercantile marine act of that year, which appropriated
$4,590,000 per annum for ship subsidies. The me
morial also showed in detail how Great Britain was
I paying annually at the same time in postal subsidies
j $3,118,448 to steamship lines carrying her commerce
las well as her mail to all parts of the globe. His ap
peal to the Germans to follow the example of these
nations was cordially received, and a liberal system of
i subsidies to German shipping was inaugurated.
In this, however, as in many other thingsj Bismarck
was in advance of the ideas of his countrymen. We
are told that when he proposed the construction of
German vessels in German shipyards the great mer
! chants were skeptical. Even after the. governmental
I navy-yards at Kiel and Wilhclmshaven had con-
J structed several first-class warships, the shipowners
J hesitated to make the venture. It was not until fifteen
years after the launch. of the Preusscn that the Norch
German Lloyd and the Hamburg-American lines ven
tured to trust their home ship-builders and withdraw
their patronage from British contractors, and that
I they did this at all, it is said, was mainly due to the
fact that they were forced into it by legislation.
I Under the pressure of Bismarck's vigor, then, Ger
many entered upon the work of building her own
ships and extending her commerce. The empire was
I handicapped at the start by want of resources and
i experience in iron-working, and still more by the
general lack of confidence. The work went on, how
ever, and now the results are before the world. At
the present time the German commercial marine is
second only to that of Great Britain. In 1871 Ger
many had in her merchant fleet for ocean service only
. 147 steamers, with a tonnage of 81,994, manned by
4736 men. .On January 1. 1898, the date of the last
i official statistics, she had 1 1 71 sea-going steamers of

BUILDING UP THE WEST.
rOR some time past our Eastern exchanges have
been giving considerable attention to efforts now
being ;nac'e by certain railwty companies to pro
i-iuic migration from the older States to those re
gions 01 the West which are tributary to the lines of
the promoting companies. It appears from reports
hat come to us that the efforts have met with marked
success, and that the westward flow of horae
Â¦eelcers has become notably lame.
The Chicago Times-Herald, for example, is quoted
as saying: "Railroads using Chicago as their gate
way have taken up internal improvement plans for
the territory between Chicago and the Rocky Moun
tains which involve the" expenditure of millions of
<io!iars and f an addition to present population from
::,ir.:ijrratio!i alone of at least 200,000 new people
within the next eighteen months. The number of
cew towns that will appear on the maps of the West
within the next year, or those to which from 500 to
600 new population is to be added, already number
173. Before 1902 it is believed this number will ex
ceed 200. Areas neglected in the past while trunk
lines were building are receiving the closest attention
Korn railroad land commissioners and traffic man
agers."
There may be some exaggeration in the estimate
that the emigration from the East will amount to 200,
000 within eighteen months, Â¦ but there can be no
tloubl the numbers moving West are very large, ami
that the efforts of the railroads are going to prove
highly beneficial in building up the Sections through
which they pass. It is said the railroads undertaking
the most important part of this work are: Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe; Chicago and" Northwestern;
Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul; Northern Pacific;
Chicago and Eastern Illinois; Illinois Central; Chj
ccgo, Burlington and Quincy. It will be noted that
the Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific lines are
not among those that are striving to build up the
West. The host of home-seekers is not to be brought
to California. Our only consolation is that whatever
builds up any part of the Great West must be helpful
to this city and this State, and therefore, while the rail
ways line? that center here are doing nothing to pro
mote our progress, we shall advance in spite of
them.

DEMOCRATIC HARMONY.
IT is interesting that the reaction against the vaga
ries of Colonel Bryan and the most intolerant in
sistence upon them are both found, side by side,
in the West, more plainly outlined than elsewhere in
the country. At his late reception and dollar dinner
in Seattle there was an all-sided riot over the tickets.
Accommodations had been provided for 1000 guests,
and the committee concluded it would be a fine
chance to put the company on record, .so they pre
pared a printed blank application for a ticket in this
form:
I hereby make application for a ticket to the Bryan
banquet at Armory Hall on Monday evening, April 2,
1900. I am a member of the party and Indorse
the Chicago platform.-
Signature Â¦ ,
Address â â .
Tickets $1 each; positively not transferable. Com
mittee reserves all rights.
To the great surprise of the managers the tickets
did not sell. It finally became plain that not 500
voters could be found in Seattle who would sign an
indorsement of the Chicago platform and pay a doi
lar to hear Bryan eat and see him speak. To keep
the victuals from spoiling the conditions in the appli
cation had to be withdrawn and the tables were fairly
filled by people who came from curiosity and had to
listen to a speech by Colonel Bryan reported to be
the dullest thing known on the Pacific Coast since a
Seattle carpenter used a carrot for an auger.
. About the time that this repudiation of the Chicago
platform and free silver was going on on Puget
Sound the 16 to 1 howl was echoing on the well sea
soned shores of Salt Lake. The Salt Lake Herald
rose and said: "Men talk about what the gold Demo
crats want. It doesn't make any difference what they
want, they won't get it in the Democratic party. The
advocate of a single gold standard is not a Demo
crat."
Now, there you have it!
Not enough Democrats in Seattle to keep a ban
quet from spoiling who will indorse a silver standard,
and the Herald reading out of the party all who in
dorse the gold standard. The situation suggests that
the Kansas City convention declare for no standard
at all, but for any well executed counterfeit money
that will pass. That would please Missouri and the
States roundabout. But fancy the Herald reading
gold standard men out of the party and Bryan sol
emnly calling them "assistant Republicans." It is
enough to make the dust of Jackson burst its cere
ments and jump out of the grave yelling "by the
Eternal" and other cusswords and feel around for a
gun, for Jackson said, "Gold is the universal and
only honest standard of value."
If he were alive now he would be an "assistant Re
publican," according to William Jennings Bryan, the
boy beautiful and Jack Cooke of Democracy.

consider the subject of holding primaries
for the election of delegates to the con
vention. Mr. Goldberg is not committed,
to the plan of appointing delegates. J.
Alva Watt, another member of the com
mittee, recently assured the State Central
Committee that primaries would be held
in the Assembly districts of San Francisco
belonging to the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict. Word comes from Santa Clara
County that the followers of the Good
Government League in that county will
not submit to the appointive scheme.
The zeal of the Democratic press in op
posing Republican primaries is the topic
of much comment. The joker in this
Democratic performance Is not at present
clearly revealed to the public, but the
revelation will be made later on when the
time comes for selecting delegates to thu
Democratic convention. The programme
of appointing delegates is already agreed
upon by Democratic bosses, but they fear
that the introduction of so much raw ma
terial at one dose will disgust the rank
and file of the party. In order to divert
attention from the carefully prepared plan
to pack the Democratic convention with
appointed Phelanites, a special effort Is
being made to discount the value of pri
maries, and persuade Republican voters
that appointed delegations will properly
represent the people.
It is not- likely that the members of the
Republican Congressional Committee in
the Fifth District will be governed by
the advice so freely tendered by the Phe
lan press. If the Democratic bosses
want to pack their own State convention
with Phelanites let them do so on their
own responsibility. The Republicans can
not afford to give the Democrats a prece
dent for "turning down" the people.
Seth Mann, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, will ask the
members of that organization to meet in
San Francisco some day near the end of
this month. A meeting of the executive
committee may be held a day or two be
fore the general committee assembles. It
seems to be hettlcd that the State con
vention will be held in Sacramento, as no
inducements have been offered for a meet-
Ing elsewhere.
California will be represented in the
Democratic National Convention, which
is to meet at Kansas City July 4. by
eighteen delegates, two from each Con
gressional district and two for each Sen
atorial. The call of the Democratic Nation
al Committee dees not provide for Con
gressional district conventions. The
eighteen delegates will therefore be
chosen by the State convention, but the
right of each Congressional district to two
representatives will not be denied. No
discretion is given by the National Demo
cratic Committee as to the manner of
choosing delegates to comprise the State
convention, hence the Democrats may ap
point their delegates without consulting
the wishes of the voters belonging to the
party.
The call of the Republican Natlonat
Committee gives no warrant for creating
conventions by appointment, but. on the
contrary, expressly asserts that delegates
must be chosen in the manner of nom
inating candidates for Representatives in
Congress.
Democrats are greatly alarmed at the
prospect of a party demand for a primary
election In San Francisco. In order to al
lay agitation and direct the attention of
Democratic voters from the Phelan pro
gramme a great outcry is raised against
Republican primaries. It is well known
that Phelan could not rally a sufficient
number of voters under his new flag to
carry a single Assembly district of San
Francisco in a primary flection. The
scheme to appoint delegates to the Demo
cratic State Convention will be carried out
in Phelan's interest if the masses of the
party do not rise In their unwashed
majesty and soak the programme.

IV. PHOTOGRAPHY IN COLORS.
When we see the image upon the
ground-glass screen of the cameraâ an
exact reproduction in both form and color
of the appearance of the objectâ it doea
not seem so far beyond probability that
the very differences in properties of the
lisiht that produce the color sensations
and that work Buch wonders' in the photo
graphic film should of themselves register
upon the nlra the colors as truly as the
form. It is only to find a suitable sub
stance, a photographic eye. so to call it.
that is not color-blind. But this is not
so simple as it sounds. Such a substance
has never yet been found, although the
searchers for It have been and still are
many. Photography in colors, so far as
it has been accomplished at all. has been
accomplished by methods more or less In
direct.
The Three-Color Process.
The first real success was obtained 'by
completely breaking away from the older
ideas and using a method In which the
final colored photograph is obtained by a
very roundabout process. This method In
all its modifications owes Its successful
operation to certain . physiological pecu
liarities of color sensation.
Color Screens.
Suppose now that the light from any
source, a bright landscape, for instance,
is passed through a plate of clear ruby
glass. The ruby glass absorbs all colon
except a pure red, and the effect of using
such a ecreen is therefore to sift out
everything but red, one of the primaries.
A photograph taken through a red screen
will give a plate in which the form is re
produced in red values and In no others.

ins? the cameraâ merely changing the
screen for one of green or of viulet â givw
other plates in which the picture la rt

images will be similat in the three plates

with the proportion of the. simple compo

parts.

The three colored positives may bo

the screen of the stereopticon the picture
appears in its natural colors.
The Joly Process.
There is one modification of the three
color process as outlined' above In which
the three primary plates are combined in
one. This is accomplished In the follow
ing way: A screen is ruled with fine lines,
200 or 30* or more to the inch, the ruling
being In the colors chosen as primaries-^
in thl3 case orange, yellow-green and
blue-violet. The lines are colored in reg
ular rotation, the first orange, the second
yellow-green, the third blue-violet, tha
fourth orange again, and so on. The three
primary color screens of the ordinary
three-color process are thus,- in a sense,
combined in one. A single exposure is
made in the usual way through this line
screen and a positive obtained, -giving the
three component color tones separately,
but divided into small portions in accord
ance with the ruling. A second screen of
ruling exactly similar to that of the first
is placed in contact with the positive, and
the picture viewed by transmitted light
appears in its natural colors. The colors
in the viewing screen are red, grÂ«en and
blue-violet.
Had Fourteen Fits in a Single Night and Frequent Spells of
Nervous Prostration* 7 Permanently Cured By
"For twenty years I was BUbject to
nervous fits and at times have suffered
greatly from nervous prostration. I had
as many as fourteen of those fits In a
single night. I was treated by good phy-
Eicians in Alma, St. Louis and Ithaca, but
gradually grew worse under their treat-
ment. I have taken an endless amount of
advertised remedies, but to no avail.
Eight years ago I began taking Dr.
Miles' Nervine and I commenced to get
better at once. The fits did not come so
ofttii nor so hard. After a few months
the fits erased altogether, but I have
never quite given up the Nervine, as I
feel the need of something at times to
brace me up and soothe my tired nerves.
This wonderful medicine has done more
for me than I can ever tell, for it ha 3
saved my life, besides hundreds of dol-
lars doctor bill.Â«. I am now 64 years old
and am feeling better to-day than I have
before in years. People for miles around
here know how bad I was before I began
taking Dr. Miles' Nervine, and many
through my recommendation have founu
it a relief for nervous troubles."
L. R. SIMMONS, Alma. Mich.
"My wife had suffered from attacks of
epileptic fits for twenty-ono years, and In
that time had been under the care of sev-
eral physicians without ever receiving
any lasting benefit. She has also tried
any number of advertised remedies with
no better results; but when she com-
menced taking Dr. Miles' Nervine she
could see a change with the first bottle.
She continued to Improve under that
treatment until the fits had entirely dis-
appeared, and she has been free from
them now for two and one-half years."
J. E. REID,

"When my sister, Edith Johnson, was
9 years old she was taken with Inflamma-
tory rheumatism and It turned into St.
Vltus' dance.* She was for six weeks that
she could neither walk nor talk, and was
in bed for ten weeks. We doctored and
doctored and she grew worse all the time.
We had to sit by her bed day and night
to keep her from jerking out onto the
floor. One day my father sent the doc-
tors all away and began giving her Dr.
Miles' Nervine, and before she had taken
two .bottles she could talk and walk. We
were greatly surprised to see how rapidly
she mended, and we think the Nervine
Is the greatest medicine on earth. We
also used Dr. Miles' Nerve and Liver
Pills in connection with the Nervine and
found them a splendid remedy."

INSURANCE COMPANIES
MUST KEEP THE LAWS
Judge Hanford So Decided, and an
Appeal Is Taken to the Cir
cuit Court.
The Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York yesterday filed an appeal to
the United States Circuit Court in this
city against the judgment of United States
Judge Hanford of the District of Wash
ington in the case of Caroline L. Hatha
way and her minor son, wherein judgment
was given against the company for 525U4 01.
Homer M. Hathaway, husband of the
plaintiff, took out a twenty-year life pol
icy for $3000. paying the first year's pre
mium of $113 10. Among the conditions of
the policy was one declaring the policy
forfeited If there was failure to pay any
of the yearly premiums. The insured
never made more than the first payment
and died five years later. The widow and
her minor son brought suit for the amount
of the policy, and Judge Hanford gave
judgment in her favor for $3000 less the un
paid premiums and Interest thereon and
plus the Interest on the amoun^ of the
policy. The decision was upon the ground
that the policy, being for twenty years,
was kept alive notwithstanding the non
payment of the premiums, by the mere
failure of the Insurance company to pro
ceed In the manner prescribed by the stat
ute to declare the forfeiture.

JOBBERS' DEFENDERS
RETURN FROM NORTH
They Are Well Satisfied With Testi
mony Taken Before Interstate
Commerce Commission.
President Baker. Attorney PHlsbury
and Traffic Manager Loveland of the Pa
cific Cuast Jobbers' and Manufacturers'
Association have returned from the north,
the taking of testimony before the Inter
state Commerce Commission naving been
concluded and the commission having de
parted for the East. They are well
pleased with the showing that was made
during the investigation. At Portland an
Important admission was made by certain
witnesses who appeared for the St. Louis
side of the case.
The differentials have been reduced to
northern points below those in force in
California. The witnesses were asked
whether the jobbers of the Middle West
had piven them the advantages, in view
of the lowered differentials, that they hact
claimed would be possible. The answei
was in the negative, so that the tesilmon>
went to justify all that has been claimed
by the coast jobbers and manufacturers.
The coast jobbers are quite confident
concerning the final Issue. The argu
ments will be made In Washington in June
and Attorneys Pillsbury and Merrln will
attend. There may be a little rebuttal
testimony then put In for the Middle
West, but the testimony for the Pacific
Coast was closed at the hearing In Port
land.
NEWS FROM THE

WATER FRONT
Steamer Irrawaddy Will Now
Be Known as Charles
D. Lane.
She Was Purchased in the East by
the Millionaire Mine-Owner
for the Cape Nome
Trade.
The steamer Irrawaddy, now discharg
ing cargo at Harrison-street wharf, will
In a few days have her name changed to
Charles D. Lane. She was purchased In
the East last December by the millionaire
mine-owner whose name she takes, and as
soon as she can be got ready will enter
the Nome trade. Captain Weeks, one of
the best-known whaling men on the coast,
will command the vessel and Frank M.
Bucklin of the United States transport
Warren is to be the purser.
The Irrawaddy was formerly a British
steamer, but was wrecked on the Atlan
tic coast, got off by an American com
pany, repaired and placed under the
American flag. She was owned by the
West Indies Shipping Company, who sold
her to agents of Millionaire Lane. The
vessel is in first-class chape, all except
her boilers, which will be replaced before
she sails for Nome in May.
Hospital Ship Missouri Inspected.
The hospital ship Missouri was exam
ined from stem to stern and from keelson
to deck yesterday by a board sent out
from the East. The members of the board
ars General A. E. Bates, paymaster gen
eral. IT. S. A.; Major John M. Carson, ex
quartermaster of the transport Thomas,
and Major H. P. Kilbourne, M. D. Ac
companying them were Captains Barne
son and Matthews of the transport serv
ice. All the defects in the vessel were
pointed out. and the chances are that
the beard will recomend that the hospital j
fittings be taken out and the vessel turned
into a freight boat.
Old Time Boatman Dead.
"Ben" Franklin Pinkham, one of the
oldest boatmen on the bay, is dead. His !
greatest boast was that on several occa- j
sions he rowod Admiral Farragut from |
Vallejo to San Francisco. For years he j
made his headquarters at Folrom street I
wharf, but when the Mail Company ran i
Its side-wheelers to Central America and :
Australia Ben held out at the Mail dock, i
He used to tell, without blushing, that on I
one occasion he >and his Whitehall got un
der the paddle wheel of the Orizaba. Ben
caught hold of one of the buckets and was
carried around three times, finally landing
In his boat, which had miraculously es
caped destruction. Another of Ben's "feats
was his beating the ferryboat Solano in
a straightaway race from Port Costa to
Benicia.

Crusade Against Dance Halls
Has Begun to Bear

Women Employed in the Besorts
Will Not Be Permitted on the
Streets During Certain
Hours.
The crusade instituted by The Call
against dens of Iniquity on the Barbary
Coast and elsewhere in this city has al
read begun to bear fruit. On the
Barbary Coast the women have
been excluded from barrooms, and last
night throngs of female characters who
until the recent exposure of the degrading
conditions in these resorts of the half
world hovered about the bars, drinking
and carousing with male companions of
a dissipated type, were lound confined In
other compartments apart from the main
barrooms.
Much of the stigma of debauchery which
has made the Barbary Coast notorious
has been removed, and recent orders is
sued by the Chief of Police have brought
about a condition of reformation. Sup
plemental to the rules laid down by the
Chief last Wednesday, and which have
been complied with, comes another, issued
late Saturday night, in which measures
are taken to bring the habitues of dance
halls directly under police supervision.

men of the tenderloin and preventing crime
have been partially adopted, and keepers
of all such resorts have been notified
by officers from the California-street .po
lice station that hereafter all women em
ployed around dance halls must report at
such places for work at a certain tima and
take their departure at a specified hour,
and that during the time intervening none
of them shall be permitted to leave the
places and appear on the streets. By
strictly enforcing this order, which will be
done, the police will be enabled to locate
any woman at any time and to keep a
close watch on her doings.
Complaints of robbery in these places
have been received almost nightly at the
California-street station, and officers on
their beats in these districts have been
perplexed when they attempted to appre
hend the offenders. As a general rule, vic
tims have been either "doped" or made
nearly unconscious by bad liquor. Then
their pockets have been rifled of their
valuables. The women Implicated in
such transactions immediately disappear,
and when the persons who have been re
lieved of their property return with the
police to identify the criminals they are
unable to find them.
' The order given Saturday night will
greatly facilitate police operations and
will have a great tendency to place a
damper on crime of this description.

LESSON WO. 9â NETJVIEME
J~* -Xâ \mJ \J Â«Â«/l *
A Few Useful Hints.
1. It is advisable that .he study should
be carried on by two or three in a cir
cle. Words and sentences must first be
read slowly and crefully. Try to make
as much use of the pronunciation given
as possible. Make the foreign intonation
clearly and naturally.
2. The intonation of the French is quite
different from the English. It ha 3 a pecu
liar accent at the end of every word and
phra.Â«e. It is a part of the language, a
part of the culture of voice; it has a cer
tain sweetness in it, and we do not say
it discouragingly, but as a matter of ex
perience, that very few Americans ever
can achieve the full, perfect pronuncia
tion. Therefore, our advice to students Is,
try to pronounce as correctly as you can
and make yourself understood as well as
possible, improving by degrees, according
to the amount of knowledge you have of
the language.
3. Although these lessons and sentences
may seem to be somewhat irregular and
disconnected, we have made them so in
tentionally, our aim being to keep up the
Interest of our students. At the same
time we give only such sentences and
phrases as will be required by those who
expect to put them to a practical use. It
will be observed, however, that each les
son has a certain aim and purpose, and
also that we try as much as possible \o
refesh the minds of students by repeating
combinations and words of which the
learner has already a knowledge, thus
obviating the necessity of a copious vo
cabulary.

gro-zaum.

femme; groce

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 16.â The stock market,
after making an indifferent struggle all day
against the force of depression, yielded all
around in the last hours and closed under (
severe pressure and with prices on a rapidly j
descending scale. Transactions were large all j
day and the railroad list made a considerable j
show of strength in the opening dealings, but
there was heavy telling in the iron and s'.eel
clocks. But some of the railroad stocks were .
tod up confidently in the face of violent de- |
â¢ lines in this sxoup. Missouri Pacific was
buoyant and carried the whole of the South
western group with tt. This stock r.-ent to i
f,1%, and its- influence promised at one time j
to overcome the reactionary forces, but it fell
puddetily to Thursday's level and the whole |
list fell heavily In sympathy. No definite news j
was forthcoming to account for the weakness
of the Iron and rteel shares beyond the as
sertions that the large selling was for account
of important inside interests. Late in the day
rumor took form that there was to be ex
tenÃlve shutting down of plants In the great
metal companies on the ground of over
production, in anticipation of business during
the early part of ihls year which had not
materialized. American Steel and Wire and
Federal Steel led the decline In point of ac
tivity and weakness. There were a few rail
road stocks besides the Southwestern croup
which made a stand against the weakness, but
the majority of railroad ttocks closed at from
1 to 2 points under Thursday's prices. The
course of the money markets In London and
lierlin gives little prospects of support for
American eecurities 'here and causes some un
easiness for the future of those markets
throughout the financial world.
The bond market was active and showed
marked strength which yielded only slightly
to the late depressing influences. Total tales,
par value. 12.385.000. "

all the sesÂ»ion as the foreign markets j were
still closed in celebration of Easter. Foreign
bids were reported Improved. At the outset
the market wag easy because needed rains had
fallen in the West and Southwest, but the

among shorts and Initial figures proved the
lowest of the day. The rally was further aided
by a report that Chile would have to import
wheat owing to heavy damages to the domestic
crop and another from Kieff. Southwestern
Russia, reporting some damage there. A.
further consideration pointed out was the probt
ability of a decrease in the acreage in the
Northwest, where farmers are supposed to
favor planting to raise high-priced flaxseed.

The corn market was firm, but not very ani
mated. The increase In the visible of 1,770,000

would crowd him into a corner and pro
ceed to pour into his ears a detailed ac
count of the aches and pains and personal
characteristics, together with a vivid de
scription of every act and incident in the
lives of each individual member of their
families. Different women accomplished
this result with varying degrees of suc
cess, according to their volubility: but
they invariably left the desired informa
tion until the last. Occasionally the cen
sus taker was so dazed by the avalanche
of words that he made his uncertain
way to the front gate oblivious of the fact
that he was without the Information he
sought, to have the same hurled after
him as he gained the sidewalk as a sort
of postscript.
It is no wonder that the marshals showed
the wear and tear of their efforts when
they reported back to their chief la?t
night. They had aged perceptibly and
all declared that before the lob Is finished
they will be either dead or impervious to
any kind of an attack that may in future
be directed against them.

KILLED BY CARELESS
HANDLING OF SHOTGUN
Ten- Year-Old Girl's Head Blown Off by
the Weapon in a Little Broth
er's Hands.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, April 16.
ANNIE NUNES, 10 years old, was
shot and instantly killed last even
ing by the accidental discharge of
a shotgun In the bands of her
eight-year-old brother, George. The
tragic affair occurred on the ranch of the
children's father, Joseph Nunes, located
in the hills, five miles southeaster Hay
wards. Early this morning the father
went to town and reported: the â¢ shoot
ing, to Deputy Coroner Grindell. who re
paired to the scene at once and made an
Investigation, which - developed the acci
dental nature of the death.
The girl's head was fairly split open, a
full charge entering the .upper portion
from a distance of eight feet. The boy
was carrying the loaded weapon into the
house, and as he passed the kitchen door
the hammer caught and . exploded . a
cartridge. The little girl was standing
near the doorway in direct line of. the
Bhot. She expired immediately.
The boy was so frightened by the terri
ble accident that he fled and hid . for
hours under a bench in an outhouee,
where he was found late at night by his
father.
Rumors of the shooting reached Hay
wards late last night, and It was then
sal d that the boy had deliberately used
his, sister as a target, not knowing that
the weapon was loaded. This story was
denied -this afternoon by the father, who
at Haywards corroborated the official re
port made by Deputy Coroner Grindell to
Coroner Mehrmann, who ordered â an in
quest to beheld to-morrow at the ranch,
the body being permitted to remain there
at the reouest of the parent*.

TRIAL OF FITZGERALD
FOR MURDER BEGINS
Accused Seeks to Obtain a Change of
Venue, but the Judge Denies
~l Tu', the Motion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 16.â The trial of
John Fitzgerald for the murder of John
Lennon commenced here this afternoon
before Judge Lorigan. Out of the regular
panel of talesmen but five were selected
to act as Jurors. A special venire of
thirty waa ordered to issue, with a direc
tion to summon them from the body of the
county. District Attorney Bullock Is pros
ecuting and L. P. Boardman defending
Fitzgerald. Last Monday, the trial of the
case was to have commenced, but at that
time Attorney Boardman moved for a
change of venue. An affidavit of the de
fendant was read at that time, in which
he alleged that on account of his attitude
at certain times upon various questions
of importance he had Incurred the ani
mosity of certain classes of people in the
county, who would now lend their ef
forts to obtain his conviction. One In
stance was that he had opposed the pol
icy of the Spring Valley Water Company,
another that he had advocated the re
moval of the county seat, another that he
opposed the Incorporation of the. town of
Colma, and for these reasons he had an
tagonized, one way or another, most of
the people of the county. Countless af
fidavits were presented by the District At
torney showing that Fitzgerald had over
estimated his Importance and that he was
but little known. The motion for the
change was denied. "
, The examination of . the Jurors to-day
proceeded upon the theory that they must
be biased against defendant' for the rea
sons set forth in the afore mentioned af
fidavit. Very few of those examined had
an acquaintance with him, and many
never heard of him. The case will be re
sumed to-morrow morning.

an inconsiderate housewife and mother

These little experiences were unpleas

did not mind them so much after the first

quired considerable ability in putting
fences between themselves and the dogs

the mothers who did not know the differ

poundman. What they could not get used
to and what promises to make WTecks of
them, mentally and physically, before the
fifteen days expire is the excess of in
formation thrust upon them by proud and
doting mammas who insist on telling any
thing and everything they can think ot
regarding their offspring. It made no dif

insisted that all he wanted to know was
the number of children in the family,
their names, ages and nativity, the mo

"THE WIZARD OF
THE NILE" WILL
HAVE A BIG RUN
Alexandre Petscbnikoff an
Artist of Superior
Brilliancy.
New Company at the Grand Opera
House^ â The Bills at the Other
Theaters Remain Un-
I have several hundred words to eat
on the question of Victor Herbert's mu
sic, which hitherto I have found it im
possible to favor or commend. In "The
Wizard of the Nile" It is so much better
than 1 dreaded that I might easily err in
overpraising it. It 13 not better than
some of the tuneful spots of his other
operas, but, taken from the overture to
the final finale. It is a very even effort,
though it is thumped out rather reckless
ly by Mr. Hirschteld.
Three actfuls of such good stuff should
be enough to mark "The Wizard of the
Nile" as a singularly good entertainment
and we should be thankful for a bur
lesque that la not composed with a scis
sors. This one has, thanks to the music,
almost the dignity of an opera and, more
over, the music carries off the usual
banality of Harry B. Smith's lined, which
is no small achievement.
It was different with "The Idol's Eye."
In that optical opera the plot was not
pleasantly absurd as this; it was silly
and the dialogue was hopeless drivel.
"The Wizard" is worth a peacock's tail
ful of "Idol's Eyes" and it should out
run it fti a walk.
The Tivoli people put a snap in the
show and gave the smoothest and live
liest first night performance I have ever
seen. There is evident in scene and
costume a more than usual taste, and the
movement of the thing is refreshing.
The chorus, cross-gartered in tinsel,
displays a multitude of golden calves that
add much to the general plcturesqueness.
Ferris Hartman grasps opportunities,
situations and chorus girls with his cus
tomary zeal and has the part of Kibosh
as pat as if he had romped it a hundred
times. - . .
Alf Whelan is in all sorts of ways bet
ter than he has been in any other part,
and Schuster gave me a similar surprise.
Helen Merrill and Annie Meyers snug
their parts and Tom Green is stiff but
harmless in a small part.
Miss Graham is a picture that might be
improved if she knew better how to make
up her eyes, and sings gloriously. It is a
way she has.
Alexandre Petschnikoff will be one of
the great violinists of the twentieth cen
tury. Had he been born a decade sooner
his fame would be a thing of the present,
as it will be of the coming era, for even.
now in his youth he is great. I am al
ways very careful about using this
treacherous adjective, but his brow had
hardly skimmed the strings yesterday
afternoon before his title to all that the
word "great" conveys was indisputably
manifest.
Violinists have been as scarce as pian
ists have been plentiful in San Francisco
these past few seasons, but our patience
has been rewarded, for not only have we
now the opportunity to hear the king of
instruments played by an artist, but the
artist is one of supreme genius.
Petschnikoff's playing is sensational by
virtue of hi:* rare gifts alone and without
the unworthy aid of tricks of any kind
whatever. He is first of all musicianly
and authoritative. His feeling for his art
seems to be as deep and true as his tech
nique is thorough and finished. He is
brilliant, yet dignified; electrifying, yet
sincere. 1 would liken his brilliance to
that of the meteor rather than the rocket.
His tone is intense rather than immense;
< p rather than broad and its superb
quality is sustained with perfect sym
metry" and the most pleasing security and
depehdableness.
His numbers yesterday were uncom
monly interesting, consisting of the
Tschalkowsky D major Concerto and
Bach's "Cha'conne." Petschnikoff estab
lished himself in the first movement of
the concerto, which was a delightful Item
and snowed a rarely limpid and sweet
cantabile in the "Canzonetta" which fol
lowed. The Chaconne, rich with a fancy
and spirituality that we do not usually
associate with Bach, was given with the
most Insinuating charm and I shall re
member Petschnikoff's playing of it as an
unsurpassable exhibition of the sublime
in music.
Hambourg was something of a dlsap-
E ointment. The charm of Rubinstein's
> minor Concerto was due chiefly to the
beauty of the composition and Its agree
able form, yet It was the best thing that
Hambourg did. In a Chopin nocturne
and two studies he exhibited an awe-In
spiring velocity and a stupendous techni
cal facility: but his interpretations, par
ticularly of the much abused nocturne,
were outre. Chopin has become a victim
of the virtuoso and Hambourg but, shows
us what new and strange things can be
done to these compositions, of which the
purely musical purpose should be sacred.
The assisting orchestra was not bad
and M. Lachaume was given much ap
plause and a wreath â probably because he
Is good looking.

Orpheum.
There are some rare and spicy novelties
at the Orpheum. but the character of the
attendance never changes-Mt is always a
full house. The .house Is so full this
week that the free list has been suspend
ed and standing room only Is the lot of
those who come late. Among the new
comers. Bellman and Moore, singing and
dancing comedians, do some neat and
original turns, the lady catching the ad
miration of the Johnnies with the be
wildering perplexities of many-hued petti
coats and shapely limbs. Falke and
Semon also pcore a hit with their clever
bit of singing, dancing and good acting.
Ventriloquist Duncan Is one of the wit
tiest and funniest and thoroughly up to
date. Something novel is the exhibit of
trained pigeons, cockatoos and ravens by
Mme. Marzella. Ravens that jump
through hoops of fire and cockatoos that
spell and turn back somersaults are not
to be sneezed at every day.
The show concludes with the Gultanos.
comic acrobats, who must be seen to be
enjoyed. The holdovers are: SI Stebbins,

California.
It was an appreciative audience that
gTeeted James Xelll and his company of
artists at the California Theater last
night. "A Bachelor's Romance" is one
of those quiet productions which com
mands the keen attention of an audience.
Last evening there was an exception to
this rule. In one of the boxes was a party
which annoyed the patrons and artists
alike by making too much noise. Toward

EXCITING TIME
AT THE MEETING
OF STUDENT BODY
Fight Over the Method of
Electing Graduate
Manager.
An Amendment Is Hade That
This Officer Be Elected
by a General
Vote.
BERKELEY, April 16.â The Associated
Students of the University of California
met in Stiles Hall this morning and dis
cussed the proposed new constitution. On
the whole the obstacles as presented were
approved by the association. Everything
was orderly as usual until section 3 of
article 4 was read. It follows:
The president, the vice president, the Â«Â«cre
tary and ih-e student member-at-large on the
executive committee shall be elected by the
association in the month of April of each year.
The nianarer shail be elected in the month o'
April of each second year by the outgoing
executive committee. But the graduate man
ager shall have no vote in such elections. FV>ur
votes shall b* required to elect the manaxer.
For the ;-n*sent year the manager shall be
elected by the active members of the Associated
Students. The faculty member and alumni
members on the executive committee shall be
appointed in Arril of each year by the presi
dent of the university.
An amendment to this was offered so
that the graduate manager shall be elect
ed by the student body. The discussion
that followed was very warm, and many
bitter thingrs were said.
It Is known that as soon as nominations
for the office of manager Is made the
names of Reno Hutchinson and C. B.
Thomas will be presented. The support
ers of both candidates then went at each
other "hammer and tongs." The mem
bers of the executive committee
thought in tho matter of making
the choice of candidates a better
and more experienced man could
be found. They suggested that some one
who is r.ot known to the present student
body but who has shown marked busi
ness ability can be secured.
This the majority of students would not
agTee to. The amendment was carried
by a small majority and the managers
will be elected by the student body.

Code Bill.
One Pro-vision Prevents the Granting

Persons or Corpora-
WASHINGTON, April 18.-During al
mo.st the entire session to-day the Sen

artificial obstructions. \ all lands and shoal
water below mean high tide on the shores,
bays and Inlets of Bering Sea, within tha

metals by citizens of the United States and
persons who have legally, declared their in
tentions to become such, under such reasonable
rules and regulations as tha miners in organ
ized mining districts may have heretofore made
or may hcrealter make governing the tempo
rary possession thereof for exploration and
mining purposes until otherwise provided by
law.
Provided, further, that ths rales *nd regu
lations established by the miners shall not
be in conflict with the mining taws of tha
United States and all permits heretofore grant
ed authorizing any person or persons, corpora
tion or company to excavate or mine under
any of said waters are hereby revoked and
declared null and void; and the reservation of

ment, which was agreed to, providing
that In case of the death, sickness or ab
sence of the Governor, the duties of tha
office shall be performed by the Surveyor

Delicate Subject Taken TJp.
The House Joint resolution In favor of a
constitutional amendment providing for
the election of United States Senators
by the people was laid before the Senate
to-day. As it was about to be referred
to the Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions, Butler of North Carolina asked
that it be read, and then addressed the
Senate briefly. He declared It was the
function of a committee of the Senate to
consider, not to smother legislation. He
thought this question had been so thor
oughly considered that it was not neces
say to send it to a .committee, and there
fore moved that it be placed on the cal
endar. Chandler, chairman of the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections, said
that as Butler was disposed to make im
putations upon the committee, he desired
right now to inform him that he was mis
taken.
"I do not," he said with a snap, "quite
like to have the Senator attack the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections in ad
vance of its action on the measure."
Hoar called attention to the gravity of
the proposition submitted, and urged that
the matter should not be considered by a
committee of the Senate. He did not ap
prove of the proposed amendment, hold
ing that its addition would give the
United States two legislative bodies, both
chosen by the people in popular elections,
the only difference being that the Sena
tors would have a larger constituency
than the Representatives.
Pettus of Alabama expressed his regret
that reflections had been made upon the
Committee on Privileges and Elections.
The motion to place the resolution on
the calendar was withdrawn, and It was
referred to the Committee on Privileges
and Elections.
Hale presented an additional urgent de
ficiency bill, and it was passed without
debate.
Aimed at Carter's Accomplices.
A bill providing for the removal to a
proper district for' trial of persona indict
ed in United States courts was also
passed.
This bill directly pertains to the cases
of the alleped accomplices of Captain
Oberlin M. Carter.
Davis cf Minnesota reported from the
Committee on Foreign Relations the fol
lowing resolution, and it was adopted:
The Secretary of State is directed to send to
the Senate a copy of the memorial of Edward
Gottfried, a citizen" 1 " of 'Wilkesbarre, Pa., and
late a consular asent of the United States at
Trujillo, Peru,' sworn to March 21,- 1900, now on
file In the State Department, together with all
papers, letters and exhibits attached to said
memorial and also copies of all correspondence
of this Government and that of Peru and of
any opinions or decisions of the Department of
State In connection with the action of a party
of Peruvian revolutionists against the consti
tutional Government of Peru on and after Au
gust 23, IS9S, the memorialist at the time being
consular agent of the United States in Peru,
the ronir-doers perpetrating, it Is alleged,
depredations on his property and Injuries to
his person In violation of treaty rights.

VALLEY ROAD
WANTS RIGHT
TO ENTER CITY
Its Petition for a Franchise
Is on File at the
City Hall.
Â»
Supervisors Are Asked to Grant Per
mission for the Operation of a
Steam Road on Illinois
. Street.
â¢
The San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railway Company yesterday filed a
petition for a franchise to enter the city,
a privilege such as Is now enjoyed by the
Southern Pacific Company.
The petition asks that the corporation
be granted "the right and privilege of
constructing, maintaining and operating a
steam railroad of standard gauge and the
necessary sidetracks, switches, curves,
etc., therefor, for the carrying of passen
gers and freight thereon and thereover
for hire, upon that certain street in the
city and county of San Francisco. State
of California, as follows: Upon Illinois
street from the north line of Fourth street
to the north line of First avenue South
for a double track, the center lines of
tracks to be thirteen feet apart, placed
equal distances each Bide of the center
line of the street."
The petitioner alleges that It forms a
part of a transcontinental system of rail
roads and that it has more than fifty
miles of railroad actually constructed and
in operation. A franchise is asked for the
term of fifty years from the 26th day of
February, 1895.
When asked concerning the application
for a franchise Chief Engineer Storey of
the Valley road said: "Five years ago we
petitioned the Supervisors for a franchise
to run our tracks over Illinois street, from
Fourth street to the city limits. As we
were in no hurry about the matter, but
wished merely to declare our future in
tention, we permitted the petition to be
pigeon-holed. Now we are ready to take
the matter up.
"It is at present intended to run a spur
track south of the China basin to Butch
ertown, so as to tap not only that dis
trict, but the Union Iron Works, the sugar
refinery and many other important manu
factories in that vicinity. Later on, if it s
decided to extend the line southward, this
spur will become part of our main line.
We do not anticipate any trouble In secur
ing the franchise, as there is very little
public improvement along the line al
ready surveyedâ it is nearly all mud flat.

age to the South Seas, will be re
leased from quarantine to-day. Her
owner, Barnett Fithian, his pretty
wife and their guest, George Loughbor

for scandal In the return of Miss Kate
Clement of Oakland, who came back sev

pression following the South Sea climate
are responsible for the dissolution of so
cial partnership, according to the return
ing navigators, and so far as the gossips
are concerned that will have to end it.
j The Rover was formerly the schooner
Baranoff. She was purchased by Mr.
Fithian, a Santa Barbara capitalist, and
renamed the Rover. .Last August, with a
crew of eight men and , a sailing master,
his wife, George Loughborough and Miss
Clement, Mr, Fithian set sail for. a pleas
ure cruise to the South Sea islands. Since
the departure | many, stories, more or, less
sensational, purporting to have come from
the party, have been .published. Miss
Clement's unexpected return furnished
food for gossip, but she steadfastly j re
fused to tell why she had left the Rover.
Later came a yarn that the owner.of the
boat, in a state of unubual exuberance,
had driven the sailing i master overboard
at the point of a pistol, and that the navi
gating officer sought refuge from the-bul
lets of. his master's gun under the keel of

Spring Valley Employes at
Niles Go Out on a
Strike.
The Extensive Plant of the Company
Carefully Guarded for Fear That
the Ex-Employes May
Do Violence.
â¢
Nearly every employe of the Spring
Valley Water Company in Niles Canyon
Btruck yesterday, and of the eighty-five
men who were at work last week scarce
ly twenty-five remained. The cause of
the strike was a reduction of the wages
of the men from $1 40 a day to $1 25, and
the men refused to accept the cut.
As a result all of the work that is now
bring done by the water company in the
Niles Canyon has come practically to a
standstill, though Superintendent May
hew says that he will be running full
force within the next twenty-four hours.
There have been no demonstrations on
the part of the strikers toward the works
of the company, but the company is
watching its exposed property pretty
closely as a matter of precaution.
The summer run of work began a week
ago. When the rainy weather began ana
the water In Alameda- Creek became high
all of the men employed were laid off ana
work stopped until a week ago. At that
time it was resumed with a force or
Â«Sghty-five men.
Nothing was said about wages on either
side. The men, most of whom had been
in the employ of the company before, as
sumed that "the scale of wages would" be
the same as last year. This gave all men
employed in concrete work $1 40 a day and
"board, which was considered as being
equal to $1 S5 a day.
When time was made up Saturday
night and the men were paid off the con
crete-workers found that they had been
treated the same as the regular hands
and were paid $1 23 a day.
This was more than the concrete-work
ers would submit to and they demanded
from Superintendent May hew that the
old rate be restored. The superintendent
agreed to submit the matter to the gen
eral office of the Spring Valley Water
Company .and there the matter hung
through Sunday. The men declined to
wait longer than yesterday morning, and
whÂ«-n no word was received a large por
lion of them quit.
Estimates as to the number which quit
to not agree. Superintendent Mayhew
says that not more than thirty left, but
'he men say that not more than twenty
tive remain out of a total force ot eighty
five, and that work Is almost entirely
lupponded.
"The wages of the men were reduced
under orders from the general office."
raid Superintendent Mayhew last night,
"and this was because of the condiiton
pf the labor market. Plenty of men can
lie secured even at $1 a day. and .It was
decided that a single rate of $1 25 should
prevail. Some of the men knew this, and
they made complaint Saturday. We will
put on more men at once and will be in
working order In a day or two."
The company patrolled Its works with a

Mr. Fithian repeatedly denied that there
had been any trouble on the yacht that
led to the return of Miss Clement. He
declared that their relations had always
been most pleasant and that there was no
trouble whatever between her and the
other members of the party.
"I Imagine." continued Mr. Fithian.
"that the fact that we were so far away
from home, in such a mysterious part of
the world, with little or no chance of
communicating with our friends, led to the
spinning of many a yarn and the weaving
of many a romance at our expense. It is
all very ridiculous. They have spoken of
me as a 'millionaire,' and from the yams
told of the amount of wine and liquor
consumed on our little vessel one would
imagine that we had a cargo of the stuff.

Robber Sharp: Hedgepeth. notorious train
I robber, and Root and Shack, burglars.
! The latter were captured by Silvey and

> month. When taken into .custody the pair
1 had over $14,000 in their possession, which
I was the proceeds of their numerous
crimes.
Silvey prior to being disabled was con
sidered one of the ablest men in the de
' partment. He knew every pickpocket and
jit Is said of him that he landed more
I "dips" in the penitentiary than any other
i officer. His successor will be Tom Ryan,
the clever detective of the Southern sta
tion.
Ryan has been on the force for eleven
years and is rc-gardcd as one of the
