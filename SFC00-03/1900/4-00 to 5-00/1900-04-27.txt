FIFTH-AVENUE HOTEL
SOLD AT AUCTION
Four and a Quarter Million Dollars
Bealizsd for the New York
Property.
Special Disratch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 2*s.â The executors of
the estate of the late Amos R. Eno to-day
sbld at auction the Fifth-avenue Hotel
and Madison-square Theater for $4.225.'X)0.
Never before has there been such a big
crowd in attendance at an auction sale in
this city, and the reason for it was that a
single parcel of the value of the Fifth
avenue Hotel has never before been of
fered for public competition.
Perhaps the most intorfstlng announce
ment connected with the tala was thÂ« re
port that William P. Eno. who bought U
and who is the son of the late former
owner, had organized a syndicate for the
purchase of the property and that thM
syndicate had caused plans to be drawn
for a twenty-five-story office building to
be erected when the existing leases, ex
tending to 1303, expire.
In two parcels there are 43.333 square
feet, equal to about 13.73 city lots. The
property Is assessed by the city at $1,150.
000. or $73,000 less than it brought at auc
tion. The late Mr. Eno bought the land
on which the theater and hotel stand in
ISJS and I*s*> from John R. Monnott for
$330.0001 The hotel and stores under U
alone are now leased for $r,10.0C0 per an
num. Mr. Eno finished building the hotol
in IS.>D, and it was lease.! to Hitchcock.
Darling & Co.. who still manage it. The
hotel, without a peer In this country at'

ijf^l square mi;es cf territory burned
M. jff over, more than 2500 dwellings.
t^Jt factories, mills, stores and other
buildings destroyed, entailing a
loss estimated to reach $20,003,000.
and between 12.000 ar.d Io.'XKJ men. women
end children homelesj, is a summing up
of the havoc wrought by the fire which
has been raging at Hull and in Ottawa
Fir.cc :i o'clock yesterday morning-, and at
mldr.ipht was not completely under con
trol.
Most of the lumber piles in Ottawa and
Hull have disappeared and are now mere
heaps of charred wood ar.d ashes. Half a
dozÂ«-n churchc-s and schools, a number of
mills, the Hull water works, the Hull
Coorthooae an<s jail, the postoJfice. the
convent â almost every business place and
about UOO dwellings and shops In Hull
have been nrstroyed. Indeed, practically
nothing of Hull is left but a church and
a few houses beyond it.
The spot where the fire originated is
about a quarter of a mile from the main
F'.vfi of Hull, and. as a gale was blovr
ir.jr from the rtprthwest. right In the
direction of -the lumber piles and mills on
both the Hull and Ottawa shores of the
< >*;;iv;t FJver and Chaudiere Falls, it wa>
soon setn that the lire was almost cer
tain to be a large one. By 11:30 the fire
had got a good hold of Main' street and
" â¢ entire street, with dozens of cross
streets, was burning. Practical!}- there Â¦
Is not a house left in the street. About ;
-â¢::> tlm<- the fire made a jump of nearly
l.alf a mi." a&d ignited Eddy's woodyard,
near the match factory. It was soon In i
fiarnes and the fifty-mile-an-hour gale ;
Â¦which was blowing drove a high column ;
<;f name across Bridge street and set fire j
t^.ihe Eddy p.iT>er mill, and the other;
buildings ol the company.
Fire Crosses the River.
The !ire r. t this time also sprang across
the Ottawa Blver and caught the sheds
in the rear of the Mackay Milling Com
pany on Victoria Island, and -in a few
minutes the lumber piles on Victoria and ;
Chaudiere islands, one cf the power '
houses of the "Ottawa Electric Company,
the Victoria foundry and half the build- I
Ings on the two islands were in flames.
The result i.< that the whole of that part i
of Ottawa known as the Chaudiere fiats, I
surrounding tho Canadian Pacific Railway I
Mation. wnere the lumb-.-r mills are all '
located, is nr>-swÂ«;,t. The only building.
fc'.;in<ling in the whole area is that of the j
Ottawa carbide factory, which is newfy I
erected and fireproof. From the flats the i
fire extended across thÂ»- Richmond road Â¦
on to BocbestervlUe and v far as the ex- j
pr-ritnÂ«-r.Uil farm. Westerly, th* lire took
in Huntonburg and MeohanicFville. po J
that on the Ottawa side of the river there j
Ss a larger area covered by lire than on
\hf Hull side. It is estimated that at the
j-irf-s^nt time the number of people home- i
lÂ«-ss in the two cities and suburban towns '
is not less than 12,'> jO and it may reach Â¦
15.GC*0.
Hull has a population of about 12.0T0 peo- '
pie and more than half of them are home- ;
less To-night. The entire business part of
the city, including all public buildings and
newspaper offices, is one mass of ruins.
The Government has givÂ«>n the drill hall
svA the city the large exhibition build-
Jngs to accommodate the sufferers. All !
th*; institutions in the city which have j
any accommodation at all have lent a ]
hand to aid the distressed. The only in- j
<Ju*try left standing in Hull is the Goul
intr & Houston lumber mill at the ex
treme end of the city limits. â¢
The Hull Lumber Company's mills, the
extensive works of E. B. Eddy, both
nÂ»atch and paper factories, as well as his
residence, are all in ruins, as well as the
lnterprovlncial bridge, which connects the
city cf Ottawa with Hull.
On the Ottawa side of the river the loss
i* ttill greater. There are in ashes the
JJronson & "Weston Lumber Company
mills, the J. R. Booth lumber mills, the
McKay Milling Company, the Ottawa
electric railway power-house, the Martin
& v.arneck mills, the Victoria foundry,
the Ottawa taw works, the Ottawa Spe
cialty Company, the Pain planing mills
and several other Industries. There arÂ« .
also some fine residences Included in this
nrea. Among them are those of J. R. '
Booth, whicli was valued at $100,000: the
residence of his* son-in-law, A. \V. Fleck; !
that of Hon. George Foster, Lewis Run
nel!, mar.agtr for Mr. Bronson, and Mr. '
I*a!n of the Pain mills, the latter two j
beautiful houses, out of which their own- !
rrs were .not. able to take anything, bo I
quick did the flames extend to them.
As soon as the members of the Govern- \
ruexit saw that the fire was to b-Â» a dis- ]
iÂ«;roup one the Acting Minister of Public i
I'orks telegraphed to Montreal. Peter- j
tooro and Brockvllle for fire appliances
and all assistance that could be sent. But
although they arrived speedily they were j
cf no avail. In Hull the fire has about
burned out. The business portion Is all !
pone and over half of the residences. The ,
Hainan Catholic cathedral has beÂ«n saved, :
together with Eddy's sulphite works, j
Gilmour and Houphson's mills are also Â¦
Ftanding. The only means of communlca- I
tion between Ottawa and Hull is by boat, j
Ftvtq 2 o'clock the only water to be had !
In Hull is from the river.
Chief Henn^tt of the Hull fire brigade j
was injured and taken to the general hos- j

Iks between Sar.nas Post and Tha
ba Nchu. General Hamilton has
probably by this time arrived at
Thaba Nchu. as he as using his utmost
endeavors to cut off the Boers who are
retreating from Dewetsdorp. The Beer
forces at Thaba Nchu are not unlikely to
make a stand to cover the escape of the
convoys from the southward. They have
laagers eight miles apart, stretching from
Brantford to Thaba Nchu. with a basa
camp at Samalldell station.
A report comes that a small force of
British mounted infantry had a brush
with a party of Boers three miles east of
Karee Siding, who were trying to estab
lish a connection between Bramford and
Boer forces to the southward.
It appears that General Brabant in the
fipht with the Boers at Wepener had a
narrow escape from capture. General
Pole-Carew's advance was much hamper
td by the tardy arrival of artillery, which
prevented him capturing Leeuw Kop be
fore darkness set in and enabled the
Boers to secure their retreat.
Although the large succession of opera
tions worked successfully, several cases
of unaccountable delay in the advances
are remarked by the correspondent.".
Taken on the whole, however, there has
been no bungling, and apparently Lord
Roberts, with the commands in the hands
of your.per genera's, now has axi exceed
ingly efficient army.
The report that thp-TJoers had rroccu
pied Boshof prows to be untrue.- , Lord
Methuen is still there, and General Hun
ter's division from Natal, which was sup
posed to be going to Bloemfontein. is ar
riving at Kimberley. This Is evidence
that some important operations are afoot
in that district. â
It is understood that the reason the
Boers did not destroy the Bloemfontein
water works was that there are many
Boers among the shareholder?.
The Boers are showing more activity in
Natal. They are placing some heavy guns
four miies north of Elands Laagte.
Mr. Wyndham's explanation In the
House of Commons yesterday has aroused
considerable comment, especially his
statement that Lord Roberts has been de
layed by the necessity of defeating de
tached forces of tho enemy which threat
ened his communication from Cape Town
and , Port Elizabeth, and which blocked
them from East Londcn. The only inti
mation hitherto received that the East
London line was blocked had been dis
credited. This was the Boer report that
the bridge at Bethuiie had been blown up.

T ONDON, April 26 (Midnight). â The War Office publishes the following dispatch from Lord 1
/ Roberts, dated Bloemfontein, April 26:
"General lan Hamilton yesterday drove the enemy off a strong position at Israel's Port by a
Â¦zvcU-conccired turning movement, which was admirably carried out by General Ridley, commander of
the Second Mounted Brigade, and General Smith-Dorricn, commanding the Eighteenth. Brigade. The
troops arc to-day advancing tozvard Thaba Nchu: Our Imscy zcerc slight, only one yet reported â
Major Marshall, Grahamstozvn Mounted Rifles, scz'ere wound in the shoulder."
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the Standard, telegraphing Thursday, says:
"General lan Hamilton* with mounted. infantry, naval guns and a hozcitzcr battery, advanced
from the zvater zcorks in the direction of Thaba Nchu. A large force of infantry supported him. He
met no opposition, and the mounted infantry occupied a position dominating the Ladybrand district/
The Bloemfontein correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, under Wednesday's date, says:
"Our mounted infantry entered the high mountain plateau of Thabo Nchu to-day, almost with
out opposition. As Thaba Nchu is a natural fortress, this must mean that the Boers' have practically
'thrown up the sponge' in this section of the country. If the force presses on to Ladybrand the zvhole
country south of that point and in line with Bloemfontein will be completely in our hands. One difficulty
is that many of the Boers forming commandos immediately on finding themselves beaten retreat to their
farms and resume the roles of peaceful citizens, hiding their rifles."
liamentary Secretary of the War Office,
replying to questions, declared that Lord
Roberts had made no comment whatever
upon General Lord Methuen"s Magersfon
teln operations. Neither, he continued,
did Lord Roberta" dispatches indicate that
the advance was either retarded or modi
lled by the scarcity of remounts. At the
Bame time, the Secretary declared, it was
true that the expenditures for horseflesh
had exceeded all the estimates and that
the War Office had invariably exceeded
the requisitions from South Africa. The
jeets of "Windsor will rebuke the Phtla
delphians who sent to President Kruger
of the Transvaal a set of resolutions of
sympathy. On the 24th of May, the
Queen's birthday anniversary, they will
dispatch two delegates to the Philippines,
bearing a message of sympathy ahrl ad
miration to Aguinaldo and his Tagal war
riors.
The decision to retaliate upon the Phil
adelphians was arrived at in a meeting
of the Board of Education of Windsor.
Arrangements were made to solicit sub
scriptions to defray the expenses of the
delegates. A canvass will be made of
the city and if enough money cannot be
raised by popular subscription the neces
sary amount will be made up by contri
butions from one or two wealthy citizens.

PRETORIA. April 25.â A terrible ex
plosion occurred at Johannesburg
last night in a magazine containing
smokeless powder. Thirteen work
men were killed and thirty-two in
jured. The building was demolisheJ and
a number of structures in the vicinity
were destroyed by fire that -was communi
cated from the burning ruins of the ar
senal. The scene was one ghastly in the
extreme and attracted a great crowd. The
shrieks cf women and children added to
the horror of the situation.
The wrecked arsenal was located just
opposite from the Begbif wcrks. used by
the Government as an arsenal. About 20u
persons, mostly French and Italians, were
employed in the latter place. Among the
injured was Htrr Grunberg, the manager
of the workn. ' ,
The cause of the explosion is not known,
though there is a suspicion that it was
the work of a traitor. Fortunately the
most valuable portions of the machinery
were saved.
As soon as possible after the explosion
the work of rescue was commenced.
Many heartrending sights were witnessed.
The Red Cross ambulance rendered ex
cellent service in assisting the wounded.
Another batch of British subjects, con
sisting of ten men. 263 women and 429
children, have been put over the border
and are goirg to Delagoa Bay.
LONDON. April 26.â The Pretoria corre
spondent of the Dally Mail, telegraphing
on Wednesday, says: "The Government
inquiry suggests that the explosion was
a planned outrage. The explosion oc
curred in a house quite separate from the
works and required a much larger quan
tity of nitro glycerin than could have been
found on the premises. The factory will
be working again in a fortnight."
The Lourenzo M,arques correspondent of
the Daily News, under Wednesday's date,
commenting" upon the methods of tbe
Transvaal Government in expelling Brit
ish subjects at a time when there is no
steamer to take them from here says:
"United States Consul Adalbert Hay Is
doing- his best to delay their departure
until a steamer is ready. As the British
are suspected at Pretoria" of having
caused Tuesday's explosion by means of
a tunnel dug from a house on the opposite
side of the street the affair is likely to
precipitate the expulsion of those yet re
maining. It Is also feared that the Boers
will make reprisals on the mines."

pired on October 5 last, but the company
applied for an extension of the period.
This was refused by the Nicaraguan Gov
ernment, and then the company, contend
ing that It had been prevented by cir
cumstances beyond its control from carry
ing out its contract, had resort to an ar
ticle in that contract providing for a set
tlement of differences between the com
pany and the Nicaraguan Government by
means of arbitration. The Nicaraguan,
Government admitted the obligation to
arbitrate the matter and announced Its
arbitrators. The company was invited to
do likewise, but being i.otilled that, in ac
cordance with the common laws of na
tions, it must name Nlcaraguans as ar
bitrators, it failed to do so.
On the 31st of January the Nfcaraguan
fiscal solicitor appeared before the Su
perior Court and asked for a judgment
against the company by default. Since
that date the matter has been held under
consideration, and the United States Min
ister to Nicaragua, Mr. Merry, has been
at Managua seeking to effect a Just set
tlement of the issue. Informat^n has just
reached here that the courts, having de
cided against the company's claims, the
Nicaraguan Government has refused to
extend the period of time allowed for the
construction of the Nicaraguan canal by
the Maritime Canal Company and has va
cated its concession, i

Politicians Are Stirring Up
Strife at Agnews
Asylum.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 26.â Medical Director
Crane at Agnews Asylum is proving to be
the whole thing, so far as the manage
ment of that institution is concerned, and
the Rca gang and local politicians have
been turned down. For years these peo
ple farmed out the patronage in the asy
lum through the locaj trustees, and the
place became filled with help that de
pended on a political pull to hold their
Jobs. With Sponogle's departure a changr
took place. Members of the gang now de
clare that Dr. Crane is prejudiced against
local help. Managers Hale and Green
inger have long quit making recommenda
tions for appointments, and many claim
that in order to secure positions at the
place they must give their address other
than Santa Clara County. Since Crane's
appointment there have been over flfty
changes in the corps of employesâ an
average of six or eight resignations a
month. In tilling these places the trus-.
tees have not been consulted.
While the local trusteesâ Hale and
Greeningerâ would like to rebel at this
monarchial reign of Dr. Crane's, they do
not dare 'to. Gage Is backing Crane up
in his administration. The terms of
Greeninger and White expired several
months ago, and it is said these vacancies
exist in the shape of a club. Should either
of those whose terms have expired at
tempt to take Crane to task they can be
removed immediately, and two new men,
with Trustee Wilson of San Francisco
would give him a majority of the board.
While there is some dissatisfaction
among the employes at the asylum be
cause of a reduction' in salaries and strict
enforcement of rules, It is stated local
politicians are working to an end to se
cure Crane's resignation by stirring up
strife at the asylum and the promotion ol
Second Assistant Physician Marvin as di
rector. Marvin secured his position be
cause of voting for Dan Burns for Sena
tor in the Assembly, and the gang have
figured it out that with him as director
the patronage of the institution would be
once more in their hands..- They think
that If matters could be made so uncom
fortable for Crane that he would resign
Marvin would be the only available man
for the place, as First Assistant Physi
cian Stocking's position under Sponogle
would disqualify him. and besides Ga^e
had recomjnended that he be removed at
the time he turned Sponogle out.
RENO GAZETTE
TAKES A WHACK
AT VON SCHMIDT
Nevada Paper's Caustic Com
ments on Lake Tahoe
k*cneme>
Erecial Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, April 26.â Under a "flare" head
line, to-night's Reno Gazette publishes
Nevada's side of the scheme proposed in
Wednesday's San Francisco papers by A.
W. Yon tachmiut, "president of the Lake
Tahoe and aan Francisco Water Works,"
by which he offers for an almost unlimit
ed number of millions of donars to tunnel
thruusn the bierra' Nevaua Mountains,
and after diverting the waters. of Lake
Tahoe, convey mem In pipes to San Fran
cisco, and practically obliterate the Spring
Valley Company.
The Gazeitc article refers to Yon
Schmidt as the "would-be water stealer
of the century," and then quotes a letter
written, ten years ago by It. L. Fulton,
then manager of the Nevada State Board
or Traue to the Mayor and Board of Su
pervisors of San Francisco, In which Yon
Schmidt's lack of rights are said to be
fully shown, and in which It Is made to
appear that the use of the waters of Lake
Tahoe are essential to the welfare of Ne
vada, and that the people of Nevada will
protect them to the last ditch against all
the promoters of Christendom or any one
else.
Many interesting figures and facts, as
well as references to the law in the case,
are given showing among othera things
that there is no surplus water to be had
and that any possible storage would raise
the level of the lake but a trifle.
The Gazette then prints an Interview
with Mr. Fulton, had to-day, In which ho
cays: "There is a six-foot dam at Lake
Tuhoe, but It does not belong to Yon
Schmidt and he. does not own the land
it stands on. Yon Schmidt claims a dam
lower down the river. That dam was
burned out years ago. It never stood on
his land. He took up forty acres, but he
built the dam on land next to It, which
the, Truckee Lumber Company owns.
What ails. the people of San Francisco?
Just across the summit from Lake Tahoe,
where no $10,000,000 tunnel would have to
be built, they have beautiful lakes with
pure water that sink into the bay un
used," Â¦.â¢ :â¢. â¢
â¢ In conclusion, Mr. Fulton says: "If you
could gel a good committee from the
Board of Supervisdrs of San Francisco to
visit the head Â« waters of the American
River, see hoon Lake. Spider Lake, Blue
Lakes and a hundred others, then bring
them to Nevada "County, California, and
to Washoe County, Nevada, and let them
see Mr. yon Schmidt's surplus and where
It goes, there would never be anything
more - heard of Mr. yon* Schmidt or his
schemes. All his talk about only, using
water that he would store up from flood
time is pure bosh. The floods are stored
now,- every drop, and theÂ»-, water' Is all
.used."-" ..'.v:'_ ;Â¦Â¦ , .Â¦â¢. Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢'.:Â¦Â¦'. .^: â¢. ? Â¦

DREW AGAINST
HIS MYTHICAL
BANK ACCOUNT
George Hayford Held for
Trial for Passing Worth
less Checks.
NEW YORK, April 26.â George Hayford.
formerly a lawyer in San Francisco and
recently a lecturer on .prison reform, was
held in $1000 bail by United States Com
missioner Shields to-day on a charge of
obtaining money on false pretenses. Hay
ford was arrested last night at his home
on advices from Washington, D. C, that
he was wanted there for passing worth
less drafts. Edwin Spaldlng, a lawyer, Is
the complainant against Hayford. He
said that on March 21 he cashed a draft
for Hayford drawn on the Douglass Coun
ty Bank of Watervllle, Wash. The bank
returned the draft two weeks ago with a
statement that the bank had never heard
ol Hayford until within the past few
weeks, when they had received drafts
from different sections of the country ag
gregating $550. Hayford said:
"There is a terrible misunderstanding.
There is not the slightest irregularity In
anything I have done."
George Hayford was for a time previous
to the fall of IS9B a practicing attorney of
the San Francisco bar, but his practices
were of such shady character as to bring
down upon him the censure of his profes
sional brethren as well as the strong arm
of jthe law. The crimes of embezzlemeot
and obtaining money by false pretenses
were several times charged against him,
but by some means not clearly apparent I
to 'the public he always escaped paying
the-penalty his offense demanded.
He was arrested on September 14, 1596,
at the Instance of Mrs. Susan Cunning
ham, a client, on the charge of embezzle
ment, on which charge he was held over
in the Bum of $3000, but was acquitted in
the Superior Court. On June 4, 1807. on <
the complaint of Attorney Jordan, Judge
Belcher In open court suggested that he
be presented before the San Francisco
Bar Association for expulsion on account |
of his shady action in the case of Wil
liam Knowles vs. B. J .Baldwin. On De- |
ceinber 20, 1807, Judge Conlan gave him an 'Â¦
unmerciful excoriation In his court., char
acterizing his conduct In. a. certain case i
as subornation of perjury and calling the i
attention of the Grand Jury thereto. , |
On March 8, IS9S, William Ralston, pro
prietor of the restaurant at 763 Market i
street, lodged complaint with the police
against' Hayford charging- him with ob- i
ttilning money on false pretenses, giving 'Â¦
a check on the Union Trust Company; and
getting change, when he had no money
there to his credit. On March 8 following
two more- warrants were issued for his
arrest, one on complaint of E. H. Baxter
of the No Percentage - Pharmacy, 949
Market street, charging him with petty
larceny by trick, fraud and device, and
the other of I). M. Fletcher, saloon-keeper
at -Hayes street and. Van Â¦> Ness.- avenue, â¢*
for obtaining" money >by false -pretenses. -;
In each of these cases he had given checks ;

Friends of Thomas Flint Will Boom
Him for the League Presi
dency.
LOS ANGELES, April 26.â A movement
was started to-day In favor of Thomas
FJlnt Jr. of San Benito as the head of the
State League of Republican Clubs. Sen
ator Flint is not in any sense a candidate
for the office and has so announced, but
he has enthusiastic admirers who will
make every effort to Â«lect him to the
league presidency.
With the close of business to-day at
noon at the executive headquarters of the
local committee their reports show that
1440 delegates have so far been reported
from 275 clubs, with a grand aggregate of
30.000 members of the State.
The northern delegation will arrive to
morrow morning. The crowds will In
clude the delegates from San Francisco,
the Oakland Alliance. Sacramento and
other cities in the northern and central
parts of the State.
It was announced to-day that Stockton
would bid against San Jose for the next
league convention.

MONTGOMERY, Ala.. April 26.â The
Democratic State Convention to-day com
pleted the State ticket, selected delegates
to the Kansas City convention, adopted a
platform and adjourned.
W. J. Samford of Lee was nominated
for Governor. Senator John. T. Morgan,
Frank S. White, A. H. Morrill and R. J.
Lowe were named as delesates at larpe
.to the Kansas city convention. The con
vention adopted resolutions indorsing W.
J. Bryan and instructing delegates from
Alabama to vote for him for President.
A resolution Instructing the delegation for
the Chicago platform's reaffirmation was
lost. The platform advocates the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal, and in
this connection pays tribute to Senator
Morgan. The treatment of the Porto
Ricans is denounced and legislation is
demanded "that will curb the Influence of
trusts and combinations."

Eprial Difsatch to The Call.
VACAVILLE, April 26.â Orchardlsts are
beginning to have their first serious
trouble with Japanese labor. Early in the
Ff-aEon it was reported that the Japanese
would strike for $1 25 a day as soon as
cherries were ripe. To-day the Japanese
a<ked several orchardists for $1 50 a day.
Â¦which was granted in some cases, while
ethers discharged the Japanese help and
put white people to work. The strike I
comes just as cherries are ripening very !
fr.st, and unless other help materializes j
will result in a serious loss to orchardists. j
WWte help is beinK put. to work as fast
as possible and should the strike con- J
tinue there will not be by the middle of Â¦
the season any Japanese working in this ;
valley.
Many orchardlsts will commence thin- |
ring fruit next week and there is not an j
idle white man in this vicinity. The apri- j
cot crop is enormous and a great deal of
thirmlns *'H1 be done. The town authorl- j
ties have determined in consequence of â¢
the demand for help not to allow any of ,
the hobo class to He around idle. Wher? ;
work is offered and not accepted by this
class of people they will be promptly ar
rested and put to work on tiie rock pile.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Wednesday, April
Co.â Tho negotiations between the United
Slates and the Porto regarding the Ameri
can indemnity claims have again been
transferred here. United States Chargo
d'Affaires Griscom yesterday handed to
Tewfck Pasha, Minister of Foreign Affair*,
a notÂ» based on instructions he had re
ceived from Washington, the tenor of
which has not yet been made known. It
is understood, however, that it demands
prompt payment of the indemnity. The
vote will be discussed at the council of
Ministers. Similar steps by the other
powers are regarded as imminent.
Charge d'Affaires Griscom In the present
circumstances declines to express his
views. The only istue at present, how
ever. Is the execution of the Porte's re
iK-aied promise to Minister Straus to pay
the Indemnity.
After Mr. Straus left the matter re
mained in abeyance until the dispatch
from Washington, April 17. sharply re
minded the Turkish Government tnat the
question required urgent attention. Tne
lorte immediately telegraphed to the
Turk'.i-h Minister at Washington, asking
for explanations of reported strained re
lations. The Minister replied that he had
called at the S;ate Department and was
Inforrr.tci that the situation had not jet
assumed a serious character. The
words, "net yet" seem to hayÂ» im
pressed the Porte, and on the strength
of this information the Sultan issued
Â»n jrade in regard to the Kharput ir.at
tor, which he hoprd would serve as a sop
tnd defer pressure in the demand for in
demnity, although it is generally recog
nized that permit-ion to rebuild will be
cf little value to the missionaries without
the payment of the indemnity.
Another irade, issued April 15, orders
Rear Admiral Ahmed Pasha to proceed
to America in order to study the con
struction cf battleships.
WASHINGTON. April 2Â«.â lt is learned
that the note of Mr. Griscom. United
States Charge d'Affaires at Constanti
nople, is founded on the State Depart
ment's instructions to press \*igorously
the claim for indemnity already lodged
with the Porte. The note is not an ulti
matum In any sense, but is a continuation
of the expressed determination of the
Department to exhaust all peaceful
â¢ir.J proper means to secure a settlement
cf these claims.
It ! s not doubted that the Turkish Gov
ernraer* trcrsU spt'edlly meet our desires
in the matter could the claims be adjusted
privately Â«r.d without the knowledge of
its European Ambassadors In Constanti
nople, but this is impracticable, and the
Turkish Government is, it is believed, em
barrÂ»iÂ»Â«e2 at the necessity of settling all
;%â¢â¢ claims of European countries for large
tun:H cf money, shr-uld the American
claims he allowed. Tho t-xpectant aiti
uiÂ« of the Kuropean diplomatic agents

cution of the negotiations is probably the
?dsi= for such s-tories as that put afloat
to the tffect that the Russian Government
Â«nu MCTCtIy backing Turkey in opposition
to the settlement with the United States.
It is realized that the Turkish Govern
ment is not at all averse to the spread of
a belief in the truth of this story, but it
is hold h^re that there is no foundation
in fact for it.

F. H. BUSHNELL'S CHAMPION DOG
LE PRINCE JR. IS HOME AGAIN
FiNEST SMOOTH-COATED ST. BERNARD IN ALL AMERICA.
AFTER a four months* tour of the circuit of bench shows throughout the
Eastern States the famous St. Bernard dog Champion Le Prince Jr.. was
returned yesterday to his owner, F. 11. Bushnell of this city. He will bo
exhibited at the bench show to be held here on May 2. Champion L,e
Prince Jr. is the best smooth-coated St. Bernard in the United States. He has
met and defeated the best dogs which were Imported from England to'meet him.
He is a St. Bernard of wonderful type. He stands 35 Inches at the shoulder
and weighs 218 pounds. His color Is dark orange, correct white markings with
dark shadings. His sire was the champion rough-coated -St. Bernard Le Prince,
who never met defeat. His dam was the famous Judith Rachel, the mother oÂ£
champions. F. 11. Bushnell purchased the grand dog from C. A. Pratt of
Argyle Kennels, Little Rock, Ark., when a puppy one month old.
This is the second time Mr. Bushnell has sent this grand dog East, and both
times he has returned crowned with laurels. Mr. Bushnell first sent his dog
East in December, ISOS. and on February 22. 1839, he made his debut at the West
minster Kennel Club show held in Madison-square Garden, New York. At this
show ho won second limit and second in the open class in a large entry,
under Miss Witney as judge. The decision caused much criticism- at* the * time.
At the Boston show held a month later Champion Le Prince Jr. met his New
York victor and defeated him under the same judge. Miss Witney, which - win
upneld the New York criticism. From New York and Boston he journeyed to Chi
cago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh and swept everything
before him, winning first and special In e-fery class. He won first in the open
class and special for the best St Bernard in the show In this city last year. He
was exhibited at the Westminster Kennel Club show, New York, on February 22,
WOO, and won second In the open class. In Boston he again took second in the
open class to the same victor as at New York, and both times under the same
judge. The victor at these two shows was not entered at any other' show where
Le Prince competed under another judge. From New York and Boston Cham
pion Le Prince Jr. competed at Chicago, St. Louis, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Cin
cinnati and Pittsburg. where he carried off all honors, being the winner in every
class in which he exhibited. He was winner of the silver cup for the best St.'
Bernard in each of these shows. Such a continuance of wins has ncjt been equaled
by any other St. Bernard since the days of Sir Bedlvere, the champion of the
world. â¢ ' .. - . â¢ â¢ 'i.i^'-i.-i â¢. Â¦- .'Â¦* Â¦
Mr. Bushnell dees not intend to stop with this one dog, for he. has already
rent a commission to England to purchase for him the best rough-coated dog
and bitch that money can buy, an he Intends establishing on this coast a kennel
of St. Bernards that will be second to none in any country.
Look out for the special
Mayday edition of The Call â
it will appear on Sunday,
physical strain to which they may be sub
jected. The medical expert paid partic
ular attention to Murphy, as attention
had been called to his heavy breathing
while he was in training. He found the
Australian's heart and lungs in perfect
condition, his previous work in the ring
not having impaired them in the slightest
degree.
The bout has been what the pool sellers
call a "nice betting fight." On Wednes
day morning, when wagering commenced,
AL NEILL, middle-weight champion
boxer of the Pacific Coast, and
Tim Murphy, champion of Austra
lia, will meet in a passage at arms
to-night in Mechanics' Pavilion. Both
men have paid the strictest attention to
their preparation and neither can have
any excuses to offer when they leave the
, ring after the referee has declared one of
them the victor. They were examined by
Dr. Lustig yesterday afternoon, and he

the odds were 10 to 7. with N'eill money

Murphy tickets. As the clay advanced the
situation changed and Instead of there be
ing a scarcity of Murphy money the op
posite condition prevailed, the X-Mll bet

either their energies or their money. Un
der this condition Vurph.v went up a
notch, closing at 10 to 8, Neill being fa

NOSE AND NOSE
Judges Unable to Separate
Them, Deciding It a
Dead Heat.

Diderot â De Blaise Shows
in Front.
Â»
In the mile selling ex-ent which con
cluded the racing at Oakland yesterday
Captive and H tad water indulged in a
highly sensational finish, baffling tho
judges as to the winner. The last named
Celdirg, with young Ranch in the saddle,
had been backed from 2 to 7 to a favorit
ism. For a time after the start Buchanan
on Judge Jingle cut a dash several
lengths out In the lead, collapsing after
turning for home. Then, assuming the
front position. It looked easy for the rirst
choice, when suddenly he began tiring.
Captive, next thÂ« rail, cloeed fast, and as
the wire was passed the spectators were
<livlded as to which had won. So were
the Judges, and a dead heat was an
nounced, giving entire satisfaction. The
owners of the respective horses agreed to
split the puree, and the crowd were not
compelled to wait and see a run-olf, which
would undoubtedly have been taken by
Captive.
As Fashion Plate and De Blaise were
the only outsiders the books did not put
In a very profitable afternoon. The card
wore a dressy look, attracting a large at
tendance.
The Golden Gate handicap at seven fur
longs was conspicuous for the marked im
provement shown by Mortgage. Some
cays ago the iilly ran disappointingly in a
mile and a sixteenth run, but yesterday
covered hem-ll with glory by stepping to
town like "Hawkin's horse" did. Kosor
xnonde was a handy second over Dr. Siiep
pard. The winner was played down,
while every other starter receded In the
betting.
Nora Ives, the entry of Frank Phillips,
started favorite for the opening sprint
over the Futurity course. Moscow Boy
raced out in front with the first choice
until he grew weary. As the wire was
approached Her.nes^y on Fashion Plata
cajue with a rush, beating the 40 to 1 shot,
San Augustine, a length.
Lady Meddlesome, at odds on. captured
the jnile and a sixteenth selling event.
Storm King gave Andy Blakeley's mare
quite a stout argument until the paddock
was reached, when the black horse gave
lt up, the favorite winning easily. Coda
took the show.
Tfie Alameda stables' youngster. Dide
rot, had a pronounced call over Bernota in
the betting on the two year old scramble
and won very handily. After fifteen min
utes' delay at the post Bernota broke away
back in the bunch, closing very strong,

form of a year ago. at .which time he was
considered a. hard one to beat. Ever
Shore, the runner up. reached his posi
tion through sheer good luck. In his run
with Esmeralda the latter dog was un
sighted, but even then would have won
but for the favor of the hare. He beat
"Wild Norah after she had run four hard
courses, which should have caused her
withdrawal. Under fair conditions Wild
Norah should have- reached the deciding
round.
The hares proved to be a good lot and
much stronger than usual, four of them
reaching the escapes. Courses in conse
quence were longer and more Interesting.
Ten short ends landed. Fire Queen
against Prince George at the false odds
of 1 to 6 was the best. Cruiser beat Safe
guard at 1 to 10 on a fluke. The latter
dog led to the hare and would have won
but for a severe fall. Not a ticket waa
sold on the course. Deckelman's Snap
shot won from Maid of the Hill in the
longest course of the day after a hard un
decided. He was withdrawn after the se

change, but it is conceded Neill should
enter the ring a slight favorite owing to
the showing he has made here In his re
cent fights. He has always been a safe,
careful boxer, erring if at all in not tak
ing the chances which have been at times
offered him when he had men at his
mercy.
To offset this. Murphy comes with a big
Australian record. He has met men in
aud out of his class and has been uni
formly successful. In addition, he has
shown well in practice here, bearing out
all that has been said about him.
â¢RIVAL MIDDLE-WEIGHTS AS THEY APPEAR ON THE EVE OF THEIR MEETING.
The bettimr in the mutuels last night
showed Murphy to be the choice of the

Chinaman arrayed in a gorgeous red

The city of San Francisco thanks the Grand

tions were not Uncle Sam standing by her side
Let us celebrate, therefore, the golden wod

question of the next location of the Grand
Parlor was taken up while the first ballot
on the grand orator's light was being
crjunt<?d. It was known then that Meserve
had made but a poor showing and a feel
ing that the south should get some con
sideration In some other direction made
many turn favorably to Santa Barbara.
Anyway, when the vote came it was too
close to be decided by the ayes and noes,
so a rising vote was ordered ami Santa
Barbara carried off the plum. The vote
stood 11s fur Santa Barbara and ICO for
Valleio.
G. O. Halll-iay and J. F. Deininser of
Vallejo Parlor No. 77 were the supporters
<"'f the navy-yard town. Halliday made
the motion and both spoke strongly for It.
Then Ramish of Los Angeles Parlor Xo.

Barbara in place of Vallejo. Sevier of
Humbnldt No. 14 and Pistoles! of Sequoia
No. !â¢Â» backed Ramish's amendment and
Coombs of Napa No. t2 and Dinkelspiel
of Bay City No. 104 spoke for Vallejo.
It was a case of Vallejo being too con
fident.

BOER ACCOUNT OF THE
REDDERSBURG VICTORY
LOURENZO MARQUES. "Wednesday,
April 25.âA correspondent of the Standard
and Diggers News with the Boer com
mander. General Dc-wet, gives a full de
scription of the British disaster at Red
dersburg. He says:
"Five hundred Irish Rifles entered
Dewetsdorp on April 1, under Captain
McWhinnie, and demanded the surrender
cf the town, which was readily given.
Captain McWhinnie was surprised to hear
that a Boer force was approaching and
he promptly retreated on Reddersburg.
"General Dewet. fresh from his bril
liant victory at Sannas Post, followed the
retreat along a range of kopjes for hours.
The two opposing forces were In camp on
different sides of the range. General
Dewet knew all about the British posi
tions and movements, but the Irish were
quite unaware of the proximity of the
Boers. They blundered again, as at
Sannas Post, and the scouts were not
alert.
"Before sunset on Tuesday Dewet had
the British force in his power, after an
engagement which lasted all the after
noon. The Irish made a 'most brilliant
defense, but their fate was never in
doubt. During the afternoon Dewet sent
800 burghers to cut off their retreat and
he then moved forward a small force of
Boers to the top-of the kopjes held by
the British. The latter boldly attacked
the Boers and then Dewet's plan was
suddenly developed.
"The British soon found themselves sur
rounded. They had. Indeed, fallen into a
beautiful trap, for they were commanded
at every point by the Boer guns, while
their force was surrounded on two kopjes
with the Boers in between.
"At sunrise on Wednesday the Boer
guns commenced to hurl shell upon the
devoted Irishmen, who. however, refused
to surrender, but fought with the utmost
fierceness for three hours. At 10 o'clock
the British commander saw that further
resistance would only Involve a useless
waste of life, as his military position was
quite hopeless, and he therefore, hoisted
a white flag. Twelve officers sorrowfully
handed over their swords to General De
wet and 459 non-commissioned officers and
men surrendered."

received the following message from Lord
Roberts:
"ELOEMFONTEIN, April 2S.â Good
YELLOW JOURNAL
SCARES TAHITIANS
Ships From San Francisco Barred
From Papeete Because of
Plague Reports.
sfv? DDITIOXAL evidence of the disastrous effect on the commerce of Saa
II \\ Francisco of the Examiners plague scare is at hand. The alarming re-
Jj ppotsf ts of the alleged existence of the dread disease In this city, sent broad
cast by the yellow sheet, penetrated to the furthermost corners of the
world, and In consequence thereof goods shipped from San Francisco are being
refused entry at foreign ports where the actual facts are as yet unknown. The
latest developments are of a serious character and the shippers of this' city, who
are the principal sufferers by the unwarranted and sensational publication, are
considerably wrought up over the matter.
The barkentine Tropic Bird and the brig Galilee are now on their way home
from Papeete, and from advices just received their owners fully expect they are
coming back with the cargoes they sailed from here with nearly three months
ago. The merchandise Is valued at JTS.OCO. and the loss will come altogether on
San Francisco parties. Furthermore, It will be Impossible to straighten the tan
gle out before next July, and in the meantime all the trade from Tahiti will pass
San Francisco by.
When the Board of Health, assisted by the Examiner, b^gran Its raid upon
the city treasury the Tropic Bird and Galilee were on their way to Tahiti, while
the City of Papeete was at anchor in the harbor of the Tahltian capital. The
yellow journal's startling story of the plague that never existed was telegraphed
all over the world, and two weeks later, when the steamer Ovaiau arrived at
Papeete from Auckland, X. Z., she brought the news of the alleged scourge.
The French commandant at once Issued orders that no vessels from San
Francisco should be allowed to enter the port of Papeete. The agents of the ves
sels sent cables back to Auckland by the Ovaiau and In due time they reached
San- Francisco. These warned the owners not to send the vessels back to Ta
hiti until letters explaining the situation arrived. In the meantime the City of
Papeete is due and the Galilee and Tropic Bird may be expected any time during
May.
"The plague scare was an outrage perpetrated upon San Francisco shipping
that we will not get over for months to come." said Raoul Jaudin of Pinet &
Co. yesterday. "As soon as the news reached Tahiti the commandant refused to
permit any" vessel to enter the port of Papeete. Our agent cabled us via Auckland
not to send out any more vessels until we heard from him by letter. All the
vessels that left here took a clean bill of health from the Custom-house and
the French Consul, but they seem to have been of no avail. By the Moana we
sent out official denials from Mayor Phelan, and the health authorities, but it
will be the latter part of May before they reach Tahiti, and in the meantime our
trade connections will be scattered. The people down there will have to get their
goods elsewhere and San Francisco will have to fight to get the trade back
again."

there is yet much :o be done. Here there
have been but a few special examinations
thus tsiT, as occasion demanded. Under

there are some forty different kinds of
examinations, and t>Â«?fore we can arracga
them we must consult with the directors
of the several instituticr.a and ge: down
to a general basa."
Mr. Serven said that since his arrival
here he has received instructions from
Washington to look into the newspaper

There has been a great deal of idle talk about the
matter, based upon the supposition that the Govern
ment has power to confiscate private property. No
such power exists, nor can the Government even
condemn private property for public use, except upon
proof of a public necessity therefor. Of course such
proof in the case of the Calaveras grove is impossible,
because its reservation is a sentiment and not a ne
cessity. It has been in private ownership for fifty
years, during which time its owner has repeatedly
sought to get it purchased for public use. But
neither the State of California nor individuals saw any
public necessity in acquiring it for the public, and
financial necessity drove him actually to a forced sale
of the property. His long ownership was no public
offense nor was his transfer of that ownership or its
acquisition by another for profit.
Sentiment asks, very properly, that this first dis
covered of the great Sequoia groves be preserved,
and those to whom that sentiment appeals, instead of
girding viciously at the old owner or the new, should
be glad that their transaction and transfer of the
title roused public attention here, and kept it awake
long enough to impress Congress with the desirabil
ity of purchasing the property.
The Secretary of the Interior, endowed with au
thority to bond it at a price and advise Congress, has
sensibly refrained from offering any price, and the
owner has fixed none. The Government must first
know what the property is, and ascertain approxi
mately its value. This it cannot find out. in the
rhapsodies of sylvamaniacs. nor the sordid estimates
of tree butchers. Therefore the Secretary has asked
Congressional authority to appoint three Commis
sioners to expert the title, examine the property, es
timate its value and arrange with' the owner for its
purchase.
This is the proper and businesslike method and if
it be authorized and followed will result in saving
the grove from the ax and saw, which have been im
pending over it all of the fifty years of its private
ownership.
THE CALAVERAS TREES.
THE Secretary of the Interior seems to have
adopted a sensible course in the process of pur
chasing the Calaveras big tree grove for a Fed
eral reservation.
All American reports from Paris -have been to ilic
effect that our building at the exposition is further
aavanced than that of any other nation, but a Rus
sian report claims that the building of Russia leads
ihc world; so it looks as if the Paris folks were trying
to say the polite thing to everybody.

LANTERNS, PISTOLS AND SPRIN
KLING CARTS.
T_\ S a result of the fiasco reform administration
/ V o; - v - avor Phclaa the people of San Francisco
are undergoing an era of something like
in which each individual must look
out for his interests and take care of himself. The
.:ccts are left unsprink'ed and the merchants have t j
â¢ ,i^i:i sprinkling carts and have the dust laid at their
t.Â»-n expense. The streets are uniighted at night and
; Otpsuds profit by the darkness, and so the citizen
\. ho poe-Â» abroad at night must provide himself with
a lantern to see where he is going and with a pistol
iv protect himself against robbery.
Robberies by footpads have become alarmingly
frequent. TVo occurred on a single night. Others
:re likely to occur at any time. In the darkness of
the uniighted streets no man can see the approaching
robber and knows not of the danger until a pistol is
thrust in his face and a demand made for his money.
So frequent have these robberies become that Cap
tain Seymour of the detective force is reported to
!<ave advised citizens to go armed when they go
abroad at night. He is quoted as saying: "Eycii
though I am a police officer, when I go home the>e
('..rk nights after the lights are turned out I carry
ray revolver in the right hand pocket of my coat and
keep my hand on it continually. If I had an oppor
tunity 1 would shoot through my coat." In answer
to the direct question, "Would you advise a citizen
abroad at night to carry a revolver in his coat pocket
with his hand on it continually?" the captain is re
ported to have replied, "Yes; that is the only pro
tection he could have."
It is to this condition of affairs the reform adminis
tration has brought us at the beginning of the new
era under the new charter. It is not an era of
-progress, but of retrogression; not one of light, but
of darkness. Public streets have to be sprinkled by
private contributions, and safety on the streets at
night is to be secured only by a general arming of
the coTnmur.it}'.
The evil which has resulted from the policy of
leaving the streets uniighted is not unexpected.
When it was first announced that the municipal au
thorities intended to practice economy in that way ir
was foreseen by intelligent men that the opportunity
for robbery would prove a strong temptation to the
criminal class. Darkness suggests crime by afford
ing an Â«uy possibility of committing it. The rascal
who would not venture to assail a man in the light
grows bold when he has a chance to approach un
?een and make the attack under circumstances that
virtually prevent resistance.
It has been suggested that the robber or robbers
who are now committing such frequent crimes Upon
the uniighted streets are prompted to it by dime
novels. The suggestion is hardly warranted by the
facts. Reading bandit stories does not excite the
commission of crime on well lighted thoroughfares,
and were our ftreets kept lighted at* night there would
b" little danger from the novel readers. The tru
cause of the outbreak of crime is the midnight dark
ness which tne reu>rm administration lias imposed
v;>on us. The bungling authorities of the municipal
ity have afforded an opportunity for crime, and the
criminals have simply taken advantage of it.

Inspired by a zeal to make themselves felt in the
community, the Supervisors are considering a propo
sition to put a tax on cleanliness.' It is proposed to
exact a license from bathing establishments. That

â¢o do with the case.

ISLAND FELLOW CITIZENS.
THE Chronicle retires within a numerical state
ment and calls the roll of the Republican papers
which agree with it in its contention that the
constitution follows the flag, that Porto Ricans, Fili
pinos and Sulus are our fellow citizens and. must
have immediate free trade with us.
While we respect the well matured opinions of
others, we have some regard for our own matured
judgment. Majorities may decide policies. They
r.everyet created truth. That exists in the nature and.
relation of things which majorities cannot change.
7l he Chronicle may have with it a majority of the Re
publican press of the country, as it certainly has all of
the Democratic press, but that does not create a prin
ciple, ncr change the truth of any proposition. If ma
jorities settle things, the tarift question was settled ad
versely to the Republican position by the party re
verses in IS9O-92. The McKinley bill and its author
were Â»et aside by a political reversal such as the coun
try had never seen before. But within six years that
reversal was reversed and the rejected author of the
rejected biil was made President, and the spirit of his
bill was refieshed in the Dingley tariff. It is not Re
publican practice to consider a principle settled by a
majority. Policies may be so settled until the majority
changes, but principles are irreversible and inde
structible by majorities or any other thing.
For these reasons The Call is unaffected by the
Chronicle showing, that many Republican, and all
Democratic, papers insist that the treaty of Paris made
the islands part of the United States, brought them
wholly under the constitution and made their people
our fellow citizens.
A professor in Johns Hopkins University estimates
that we have in the United States thirteen millions
of negroes. He points out the growing danger, to
our social and civil institutions, in the rapid increase
in our domestic colored population. We believe that
danger is appreciated by all thinking men, white and
black. The history* of man furnishes no instance in
which the two races, white and colored, have sat
down under the same vine and fig tree, on terms of
civil equality, and dwelt together in peace. The pro
found agitation in progress in our Southern States,
aimed at defeating the r.egro ballot, although his
right thereto is planted in the Federal constitution, is
only a ?egmer.t in the circle of fire that is around us
in consequence of the race problem already on hand.
To these difficulties the Chronicle and the Demo
cratic party desire to add the irrevocable citizenship
of fifteen millions of islanders, of many races and
origin inferior to us. This would load us with a col
ored and inferior population of 28.000.000!
If we have a problem now. due to the presence of
white and colored on terms of civil equality in the
temperate zone, what misery-are we taking into the
very marrow of the republic with fifteen millions,
mostly colored, to whom our very language is jar
gon, to be our constitutional equal?, in the torrid
zo:ie where we cannot live nor stay to teach or con
trol -them except with powder and ball!
Between the two parties in this country four yeais
ago thtre was a margin of 600.000 votes. A colored
population of 28.000.000 will have 5.600.000 voters. Our
"island fellow citizens." as the Chronicle fraternally
calls them, will have 3.000.000 of voters! They can
swarm into the States, and without waiting for state
hood in their o.vn territory can. not only control an
election of President and Congress, but can also dic
tate their own destiny, compel the admission of their
islands into the Union, and, alternating their favors
between the two parties, can wield the substantial
power of the government.
This is no imaginative picture. We have seen what
ambition can do in the Philippines in the leadership
of Rizal and Aguinaldo, and amongst the West In
dians in that of Garcia and Gomez.
Before exposing the country to such results of the
Chronicle- Democratic policy, the people want time
to think. After Louisiana was purchased the country
trusted Jefferson to rule it until the people handed up
to Congress a policy for its government. The people
are willing to trust President McKinley in like man
ner, to administer these islands until we have taken
our bearings and make up our minds upon a policy
that will, primarily, secure the safety of our own
country and the prosperity of our own people, and,
secondarily, do the best that can be done for the 1
islanders themselves.
The Chronicle contends that the whole issue was
settled and concluded by a ptar.k in the Republican
platform of this State, adopted August 24, IS9B, ten
clays after Spain asked a protocol and seven months
before the treaty of Paris was ratified!
We deny that such action at that date binds any
body on that issue.
No one would suspect that the real estate man of
Oakland who had himself arrested for battery was
looking for a free advertisement. He probably be
longs to an unknown band of civic reformers.

NOT A CAMPAIGN ISSUE.
S~~^ OMMEXTING upon the earnestness with
( which the Pacific Coast States have taken up
the issue of restricting Japanese immigration
since The Call exposed the extent to which that im
migration has developed, the Philadelphia Public Led
ger says: jj "Perhaps it would be better for the whole
country if its Atlantic coast were as sensitive on the
subject of undesirable immigrants as its Pacific side.
That section has succeeded in excluding Chinese la
borers, without stopping to make distinction between
those who might be desirable and those who might
not, and now it is threatening further agitation on
account of the influx of Japanese. It has succeeded
in inspiring the British Northwest with the same
spirit, and the people of Vancouver arc moving for
a restriction on Japanese immigration at that port.
The Britith Government is too' conservative to move
hastily in the matter, and if it places any restrictions
on the Japanese will do so only after investigation
and full consideration, but we may as well prepare
for an issue of this kind as an incident in our coming
Presidential campaign."
Our Philadelphia contemporary is wrong in sug
gesting preparation for the issue as an incident of the
campaign. It .is not one of party politics, nor is it
likely to be. For the exclusion of Japanese our treaty
with that country will have to be revised, and that is
a matter for the careful consideration of the adminis
tration and of Congress. There is no need for a
campaign of education on the subject among the peo
ple, for they arc virtually of one sentiment concern
ing it. All that is to be done is to urge the matter
upon the authorities at Washington, and that has to
a considerable extent been accomplished, for after
the publication in The Call of the rapid growth of
j the immigration the ( Congressmen from this State
at once took the matter up. It will not be neglecte-.l
nor forgotten. The press. and the people will see to
that, but there is no reason why it should be. inter
jected into the campaign even as an incident.
If there be any immigration question in the cam
paign it. will be one of comprehensive restriction,
Oakland pedagogues .want to teach their youthful
charges morals and manners by set rules. This ought
to suggest the necessity of giving to each otTcnse oÂ£
which the youthful mind is capable a , mathematical
! dealing with the whole subject and aiming at the <x
j elusion of undesirable immigrants of all kinds. That
is an issue which has long been debated, and it is
time that it were .settled. The Ledger is right in
saying "it would be better for the whole country if
its Atlantic coast were as sensitive on the subject
of undesirable immigrants as its Pacific side."

HE KNEW A GUN BUT
The man who thinks he can shoot en
tered a Washington sporting goods store
recently and looked with the critical, ex
amining glance which at once stamps one
as being a sportsman of experience, at a
new model shotgun.
He deftly raised the weapon to his
shoulder and squinted down the polished
barrel with a regular trap-gun-nlnety
nlne-out-of-a-hundred squint.
He tossed it at different angles, dropped
it in the hollow of his left arm. fingered
the safety lever with a skilled hand and
lovingly snapped the triggers.
He opened the breech and held the bar
rel between his eye and the light from
the window, and said something about U>q
advantage of using "barrel reflectors" for
cleaning.
The clerk was much impressed. He
smiled.
The learned gunner talked of "choke
bores," "new s.xteen-gauge." of the new
"takedown, single-barrel repeating" shot
guns being inferior to the old and tried
double-barrel gun; of the relative qual
ities of "Damascus," "double laminated."
"decarbonized," 'Tine three-blade," and
other barrels; of "half-pistol grips,", "au
tomatic ejectors" and "solid strikers."
He expiated on "nitro-powder guaran
tees," "low circular hammers," and ex
plained to the clerk how easy it was to
take out the "safety plunger" with safety.
He was eloquent about â¢'flat" and other
"trajectories." lie knew all about
"globe," "wind," "knifeblade," "bead"
and "peep" sights*
The clerk was. much Impressed. He
laughed.
He gave a practical illustration to the
admiring clerk of "how to stand when
trap shooting, without muscular strain or
tremor. He demonstrated tho importance,
where "aperture front sights" were used,
of having the "aperture In the bead 'ring'
the bullseye."
Then he bought the gun.
. A week later he returned to the store as
mad as one of the hares he had hunted.
"Here, you!" he cried to the clerk, an
grily. "Here, take this gun back! You
have cheated me! It won't "ihoot!
"I have tramped over the fields of Vir
ginia for six d.iy^Â». and banged away at all
ranges at everything from a chippie bird
to a cow, but never once have I brought
down the game. I have shot until my arm
aches and my shouidtr Is numb. I have
sworn until 1 can swea.r no more. Take it
back, or I will have you arrested for ob
taining money under false pretenses!"
"What kind of shells have you been us

"These."
"Oh, that's all right. Keep the gun; it

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AVMML V!TÂ» UHK),
OAKLAND'S TELEPHONE MONOPOLY.
/~"\ AKLAND is now to be, added to the length
( J ening list of cities whose people have begtrn
Ma campaign against the aggressions and the in
efficiencies of the telephone companies. Possessed of
a monopoly which even if managed with fairness
would yield an enormous profit, these companies in
all parts of the Union seem animated by a mad kind
of avarice which impels them to inflict upon the pub
lic every sort of wrong that will yield a penny to
themselves. *
The form in which the Oakland company appears
to have committed its most serious offenses against
its patrons is that of an inefficient service. The com
pany demands good pay and high pay. but it gives
poor work. At a recent meeting of the Merchants'
Exchange of the city there was an extended discus
sion of the subject, and without a dissenting voice a
motion was adopted to communicate to the company
a protest against its methods of doing business.
In the course of the discussion one of the speakers
stated that the telephone service in Oakland is worse
than any with which he had come into contact in
any part of the country. He is quoted as saying: "I
have lost whole hours in trying to make a switch, and
have given up in disgusts They tell you 'Line's busy,
call again,' before you even ask fo- a number. * *
We pay enough for the telephone and should get
good service. It is time to call a halt."
In Oakland, as everywhere else, one of the evil
practices of the company is to cut down wages and
overwork the employes, so that the service is neces
sarily inefficient. In their greed to get as much as
they can for as little as possible t'-e monoplists will
not provide a service at all equal tvi that which they
promise and for which they exact exorbitant pay.
As a result of these extortions artd frauds, petty in
detail but in the aggregate amounting to enormous
robberies of the public, there is now going on in all
parts of the Union a vigorous campaign in favor of
stringent and comprehensive regulation of telephone
rates. In some instances competitive companies
have been invited to enter the field, and the competi
tion has proven beneficial in some respects. There is,
however, a serious objection to competition in tele
phone service, due to the fact that it is desirable all
parties should be connected with one line, so that no
one would be compelled to have two or more tele
phones in order to communicate with the community
at large. For that reason State or municipal regula
tion of telephones is preferred to competition, and it
is now probable such supervision will be ere long es
tablished throughout the country.
The agitation in Oakland comes at an opportune
time. We are now on the eve of electing a Legisla
ture to assemble next winter. The question of State
supervision of telephones can therefore be made an
i?sue of practical politics at once. Every candidate
for the Legislature ought to be required to give to
his constituents a specific pledge to vote in favor of
such supervision at the coming session. That is the
best solution of the problem which the extortions of
the telephone companies have forced upon the peo
ple, and as a remedy for notorious offenses it should
be promptly applied.

Soher's downfall is another name
added to the dishonorable roll of
victims of racetrack gambling in
California. He had been for many
years a trusted clerk In the dis
tributing department of the San
Francisco Postoffice. About a year
ago he was seized with the gam
bling mania and most of his earn
ings went into the pockets of the
bookmakers. A short time ago it
was discovered that he had been
embezzling funds from the estate
of Lewis Soher, his father, and
squandering them upon the race
track. With the discovery came
his flight, and the detectives are
yet' ln pursuit of him.
PostofÃce officials say that up to
the time he began to attend the
races he was a man of Unblemish
ed reputation, of great industry
and attentive to his duties. After
that fatal epoch the change was
swift and marked, and he went the
way of all turf gamblers.
CONTRACT LABORER
ORDERED DEPORTED

.Money.
A. K. Coney, Mexican Consul, called the
attention of United States Immigration
Commissioner North yesterday to the fact
that Maximlno Villasenor, a recent immi
grant from Mexico, was In a state of des
titution und had become a public charge.
Mr. North detailed Captain A. de la Torre
Jr. to investigate the case, and upon his
report Mr. Villasenor will be deported.
According to the statement of the un
fortunate man. he was Induced to come
to this country last July by Mrs. Fran
clsca Carillo de Guglieri. who resides with
her husband at 821 Vallejo street. She
paid his passage from Mazatlan to this
city and promised that upon his arrival
she would give him constant and remu
nerative employment. She was at the
dock when the steamer arrived and passed
him $30 as "show money" for the eyes of
the Immigration officials.
After working thirty-eight days on the
ranch and receiving no pay Villasenor re
turned to this city and was for three
months a patient in the City and County
Hospital.

that the heavy weieht of the tree on fine

XIII.â PORTRAITURE AT HOME
BY F. DUNDAS TODD.
Over half a million cameras are sold In
this country every year, and a very large
percentage of them are bought for the ex
press purpose of photographing the baby.
Poor babies, they have my sympathy. I
sometimes think that about a score of
years hence all those who have been libel
ed from Infancy by a camera In the hands
of devoted parents wijl band themselves
Into a league of some sort or another, un
der some such title as the "Anti-Baby-
Portralt-by-Parents Society." and If they
do It ought to be the biggest and most
Influential body this nation ever saw. If
imbued with the proper spirit, it could
entirely alter the complexion of political
parties and such terms as Republican.
Democrat. Populists, free sllverltes, etc.,
would be interesting from an antiquarian
standpoint only.
But all joking aside, a camera in the
hands of the average individual is a ter-

Home Battalion of the Four

Sherman.
Majority Are Native Sons Recruited
at Cnn^) Merrittâ Six Die En
Route From Manila â Ves
â¢ sel Quarantined.
The United States transport Sherman
arrived from Manila early yesterday
morning, making the trip in twenty-six
days; seventeen days from Nagasaki. 3he
has on board a battalion of the Four
teenth Infantry. 154 prisoners. 27 insane
people and 172 invalid soldiers. There were
six deaths during the voyage, and as
there were some suspicious cases among
the sick Dr. Klnycuri ordered the vessel
Into quarantine.
.Besides the private soldiers and the sick
the Sherman brought up fifty-two cabin
passengers. Many of those are officers of
the battalion, and the others are officers
home on sick leave, nurses and civilians
given transportation to San Francisco by
General Otis.
The boys of the Fourteenth will be
given a cordial welcome when they land
from the Sherman. Nearly all of them
are Native Sons, as the Fourteenth was
recruited at Camp Mcrritt nearly two
years ago. They have done some hard
campaigning in the Philippines and have
Leon sent home to recuperate. After a
short rest at the. Presidio they will be
sent to Fort Wayne, to which station they
have been assigned.
Soon after the Sherman reached quar
antine the Government tujr Fearless went
oiu to her and put the mall aboard. In a
very short time the letters were distrib
uted, and soon every, one of the returned
soldiers was reading the latest news from
home. Those who hung over the rail
viewing the shore did not seem to have
much the matter with them, but the sick
in the ship's hospital tell a different tale.
Home of them arc having a hard fight
with death, and the chances are that the
number of fatalities will be increased be
fore the transport i 3 released from quar
antine.

XII.âCOMPOSITION OF A PIC
TURE
(Concluded.)
BY F. DUNDAS TODD.
Pyramidal composition is the simplest
and best for figure studies and groups,
Fig. 7 shows this form very -pell, the one
line running from the brow to past the
hp.nd3 and knees to the floor, the other
starting from the top of the head runs
past back of chair to the ground.
In his first efforts at composition the
beginner is very apt to be somewhat at
sea. and it will therefore be wise of him
to follow the mr-thod recommended by the
late Norman Macbeth, a distinguished
Scottish artist, who took a kern interest
in photography. Ke recommended pro-
Th*Â»y really couM not proclafm It morÂ»
efficiently if they removed the roofs of
their heads and exposed to the view of.
the world the blank condition of the pho
tographic department of their brains.
Now, I want to see ail this changed. I
want to srtÂ» everybody using the camera
wiih intelligence and with a purpose. I
want each Individual to know exactly
Trfuit he wants, and I am pretty certain he
will see that he Rets ii. I do not pretend
to be able to teach the v.hole art of por
traiture in one short lesson, but T think
I can piv*- material fr>r the laying of a
Rood foundation, ar.d any tiiinklr.ff person
can add to the structure as he roÂ»>s alone
In ether words. I propose talking about

the rest. But It cannot, for it has no
brains. He has brains, but won't use
them, Is in fact Intellectually lazy, and
glosses the facts over by asserting he is
too busy. - *
A camera is only a tool and can record
only what is In front of It. What It pho
tographs is a sure measure of the intel
lectual caliber and artistic taste of the
person who handled It. I am afraid the
average individual never dreams of this
when he passes his photographs around,
for If he did he â¢ would probably dig a
hole and bury them instead.
What does the average man or woman
know about portraiture? Absolutely noth
ing. Yet they make portraits and there
fore every print they make shouts aloud
the appalling depth of their ignorance.

RUEF DONATES HIS
FEE TO CHARITIES
Judge Coffey's Schedule Causes an
Unpleasant Debate in the Fen
nell Case.
A. Ruef donated to charity the fee al
lowed him yesterday by Judge Coffey In
compensation for hl3 services as attorney
for the special administrator of the estate
of the late Winifred FennelH Before
Mr. Ruef made the donation, however, he
indulged in an argument with the court
as to the merits of the latter's fee sched
ule. He demanded ICOO for his services In
settling the estate and asked, that $250 be
allowed Special . Administrator Drink
house.
Judge Coffey said that $100 was a reas
onable counsel fee and fixed it at that
amount. Mr. Ruef said he would be as
liberal as the Judge, and asked that the
feÂ« alloâred him be divided among tho
Roman Catholic, Protestant and Hebrew
orphan asylums of the city. â¢
"Your criticism Is the most unjust of
the many to which this court has been
subjected during recent years." said
Judge Coffey. "It hurts me to the bone â
to the marrowâ and Is uncalled for."
, Mr. Ruef declared the court had award
ed larger fees In cases where* the work
was not so hard. Judge Coffey responded
that the feÂ«a -were larger because the
amounts Involved were greater.

Ship Annie Thomas Has Been
Posted at Lloyds as
Â¦ Missing.
Captain Merideth, Her Master, Well
Known in San Francisco and
Wp.s Last Here in the
Dominion.
Â» .
The British sh!p Annie Thomas, on
which there has been a considerable
amount of reinsurance gambling in San
Francisco, was "posted at Lloyds as miss
ing" yesterday. This means that all the
money put up on the chances of the ship
ever reaching port has been lost. When
a vessel i.Â« "posted at Lloyds" all insur
ance claims must be paid, captain and
crew are clapped among the dead and
pone, while the craft !s stricken from the
world's list of merchantmen. There are
some people in San Francisco who assert
that the Annie .Thnmas will be heard
from, and that Captain Merideth will
bring his ship into port.

NFV." TORK, April 26.â The stock market de
veloped an Impressive chow of strength dur
ing the latter part of to-day. The principal
Influence in the rise was a resumption of the
upward movement in Pennsylvania and Balti
more and Ohio Mock. The recent reaction in
these Btocks has boen accompanied by rumors
that Important cpeculative Interests which had
lcÂ»n prominent in the advance had cold out
and taken their profits. The news of the very
heavy outlaye Jn prospect for permanent bet
trrment and increafied Ehipmenti awakened
pome apprehen*ion of dividend Increases being
lrideflr.itfly postponed, not only on Pennsyl
vania Etock. but on Baltimore and Ohio and
many ethers which have been subject to ru
mors of increased dividends, but to-day the
report of a probable Increase In the Penn
sylvania dividend rate took form again and
ru circulated with tr*-> explicitnegg. Blfli
were made en the board for the next eemi
anniul dividend on Pennsylvania on thousands
of shares cf stock :*Â» per cent, compared with
2^4 per cent the last rate. The meeting of
the directors for the purpose of fixing the
dividend rate is fixed fcr Tuesday next. These
rÂ«-portÂ» In regard to Pennsylvania had the
ruoÂ«t Indirect influence in IJaitimore and Ohio
Â¦toclce next to i'czinsy] va.nta ltseir, but the
whole railroad list rerjKmded in varying de
l^eeÂ« to the Influence of this movement. These
pools, whose operations for a rise were in
terrupted by the i-teel and wire episode, re
turned their operation? to some extent. This
â¢was notably true of the Gould Southwestern
group, which are subjects of teeming rumors
of prospective combinations or consolidations.
The dtterm'.hPd firmness of Sugar and Its
liuoyant upturn later had a sympathetic effect
ob the market. The movement Is etill at
tributed to the demand from tnÂ«> thorta. but
the many assertions of favorable developments
In the tra<?e war may have had their effect.
A number of unusually favorable railroad
statement* had a strengthening effect on the
market. Increase in net earnings for March
were reported by the AtchlÃon, Topeka and
Jianta Fe of 53 per cent; by the Hocking VaJ-
Uef Kallrfiid of 105 p*r cent, and by the Cen
truJ of Georgia of 20 por cent. Returns of
ktors earnings for the third week in April
were al?o uniformly favorable. Thene factors
of strength caused growing uneasiness among
the rather w leldy nhort Interest and the de
mand from that element had no small part
In the rallj- in the market. ThfÂ« unsteadiness
cf the sterling exchange market to-day gave
ground for renewed doubt as to the continuance
for the present of the gold export, movement.
The etrong return of the Hank of England
fcr the Wf-ek as wÂ«-ll ac that of the Imperial
1 ..-.:â¢. of Germany hzu& some effect on the ex
change market. The FUb-treaeury's debit bal
ance at the clearing-house showed a further
decline to-day, falling to $300,M>9, compared
with the recent average of over a million-dol
lars. If this replenishment to the money mar
krt is cut off it may serve to prevent the out
ward flow of jrold.

EASTERN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, April 28.â The corn market opened
erratically because many had expected a rush
of selling orders, in place of which some of
the Influential people were buyeri. The In
fluences were the strength of Liverpool, par
ticularly for spot, and the reports of delay in
seeding due to the rains. A broad general
demand developed at the start and the price
went up on the Jump, longs, shorta and traders
buying as If there was 'nothing in the world
worth having save corn. At the top the de
mand slackened and In proportion the offerings
Increased. The cash business was poor and
New York reported only ten loads taken for
exportâ a poor showing in comparison with
recent export business. Under these conditions
the market proceeded to relinquish Its early
gaim and the result was a weak close. May
ranged from 40Â»Â»c to 33% c and closed Vie down
at 33Â»,Â£c; July, from 4iVJc to 40% c, closing
Ko9ic depressed at 4O'.Â± 1 940% c. Receipts here
were 14S cars. Trade early was characterized
by great activity, but the later part of the
session the animation was much less marked.
In the wheat pit at the opening disappoint
ment was felt at the cables, which did not
reflect the advance here yesterday. In ad
dition to this the weather wan reported per
fect and the crop proipects good. With these
things In mind the beginning of trade saw
the market easy and depressed. The corn
strength, however, was felt almost Immediately
and under that Influence wheat rallied, shorts
covering freely. The cash business was very
slack and the trade in futures most of the
time quiet. With the talent bearish the break
In corn was readily .followed, early buyers
Felling out. The close was weak. May ranged
from 66VÂ»c to 65% c and closed H@%c down at
er.^fjC.'.Vic; July opened at 67?4c to 67V4c. ' ad
vanced to 67"4 c and declined to 67c, closing at
that figure, -} 4 c under yesterday.
Oats were steady at one time, but finished
weak In sympathy with the wind-up In corn
and wheat. Even at the periods of the great
est strength In corn and wheat 1 this market
responded very heavily. The cash demand waa
reported poor and the good weather had a
depressing effect generally. Local receipt*
were 132 cars. May ranged from 23V4c to 23!^@
23'/4c, and closed V4@Vic under yesterday at
23 '1,1} 23 1ie: July sold from 23% c to 23H&23 I >c
and closed H@ ;> Â£c down at 23?4Â®23V6c.
Lard was the main item in the provision mar

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
The Egg market Is badly mixed, owing to the
pernicious system of contracting on newspaper
quotations, which Is not good business pro
cedure and la goln? to make trouble for some
body, sconer or later. Thus, 17c Is being paid
in Fetaluma, because the San Francisco papers
quote this figure, and the Eggs are brought to
this city and sold at 18c. which, of course,
ought to be the quoted price. But If 19c were
quoted, then the San Francisco merchant
would have tn get 19c, and the next day 20c,
and. so on, until the price would be above what
the toods were selling for, which would stop

London Market.
NEW TORK, ADril 26.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were quiet to-day, but there
was more investment business. The bank re
turn caused a firmer tone, although the close
was rather unsettled. Consols were fractionally
harder and the war loan touched 1 1-3 premium
on strong buying, finishing *at 1 3-16. Americans
were Inactive but cheerful, being made harder
despite the absence of Continental support.
New York responded and the close was near
the top. The features were Baltimore and Ohio
and Wabash bonds, the latter on New York In
quiry. Coppers were again wanted at a U rise
en bear closing-. The bank bought JC30.000 In
German coin. The fall in sterling exchange
reduced the talk of American exports, but it is
reported that gold Is going- out soon from Lon
don to Paris. Call money was firm at un
changed rates and bills were harder and fewer
were offering. The bank renewed the few sums
due and also lent slightly, besides doing a mod
erate business In discounts. The bank return
shows a rise of i 2.500.000 In puMlc deposits,
merely representing bankers holding back funds
for the end of the month and the war loan call
of 10 per cent on Thursday.

PENCIL DEEDS
ADMITTED INTO
THE EVIDENCE
Attorneys for Respondents
Gain a Victory in the
Fair Case.
Judge Troutt decided yesterday to ad
mit the pencil df-eds in evidence in the
Craven-Fair litigation now pending In his
court.
"In ruling on the objection to offered
evidence I shall merely say the deeds are
an important circumstance, as they tend
to show that a provision had been made
and might be such as a man like Senator
Fair -would make for his wife." said the
Judge, In rendering the decision. "I con
eider it relevant to the issue and not
collateral, and so shall admit the deeds in
evidence."
When the pencil deeds were disposed of
the Grand Opera-house noteâ "Mrs. James
G.. do you know your name? James G.
Fair"â was- taken up. A squabble of the
attorneys followed. Expert Kytka was
called to the stand. He had a photo
graphic enlargement printed on a screen.
Although the negative from which the
print was made had been developed ac
cording to stipulation, the print was not.
Expert W. J. Street, engaged by the es
tate for the petitioner, was not present
when it was made. This caused an objec
tion from Charles Pence. The court over
ruled it and the screen print was admit
ted. The trial was adjourned at 12 o'clock
and -will continue on Monday morning.
NATIONAL BANKS
INSTITUTE SUIT
TO AVOID TAXES
Assessor Dodge Restrained
Prom Levying on the
Assets.
The Nevada National Bank of San
Francisco, the San Francisco National
Rank, the First National Bank and the
Crocker-Woolworth National Bank have
brought suits in the United States Circuit
Court to restrain Assessor Dodge from
proceeding with the collection of the taxes
en the personal property of the banks.
Judge Morrow has issued a restraining
order and the Assessor will be unable to
take further action until the court passes
upon the case.
The banks allege that the Assessor la
proceeding in violation of law, that on the
nrst Monday in March. 1900. all the prop
erty of the banks, except the real estate
and mortgages, was exempt from assess
ment and taxation. It is alleged that the
Assessor will claim that while United
States bor.rls sire exempt, the premium
thereon Is liable to assessment and taxa
tion and that he v.ill not deduct It from
the value of the stock.
Suits of a similar nature were filed
against the AÂ«Â«es.-or last June by the
same banks. The outcome was that the
Assessor was enjoined from collecting the
taxes. The cases were submitted on briefs.

ten to the principals of the High Schools

counters. -

protect themselves.
HAWAIIANS
ARE OPPOSED TO
PROHIBITION
Gillette Amendment Is
Unpopular in the
Islands.
Special Correspondence cf The Call.
HONOLULU, April 17.â Not even the
amendment to the House Hawaiian bill
providing for the deportation of all Asi
atic contract laborers introduced into the
islands since annexation created as much
surprise and met with so strong an op
position sentiment as the Gillette amend
ment prohibiting the sale of liquor in sa
loons. Outsiue of a handful of prohibi
tionists, scarce one of whom has been in
the islands more than three or four years,
together with the few members of the
Woman's Christian Temperance L'nion,
no one can be found who approves the
amendment or who is willing that it
should become a part of the organic law
of the Territory without a protest. Every
element of the community almost is
against It, and none more radically than
the church and temperance element.
This element holds that the present sys
tem of regulating the liquor traffic, which
is the result of years of legislative strug
gle, is the best that can be devised to
meet the conditions here, a seaport town,
and otherwise influenced by a transient
population. Cnder this system the num
ber of saloon licenses issued is restricted
to seventeen for the whole group. These
each pay a license fee of $10:?} a year, the
saloons are closed at 11:30 o'clock at night"
and are closed all day Sunday. No music
Is allowed In them, nor is liquor allowed
to be sold to women or minors. They are
under strict regulations which can be in
creased by the Minister of the Interior to
meet special conditions, and the penalties
imposed for violating these regulations
are very severe, a second conviction for
feiting the license and the bond of $1003.
For localities where a saloon selling all
kinds of liquors might be a center of
loafers and a temptation to idleness, a
secondary class of licenses are issued,
called iight wine and beer licenses. Un
der these licenses only light wines and
beer may be sold, the places must close
at 8 o'clock at night and remain closed
on Sunday.
Under this system it is acknowledged
that saloons and Â«aces where lfquor is
sold have never been the centers either
of crime or disturbance. It has thrown
the business into the hands of a much
higher and more reliable class of men
than carry it on in most communities and
the business is conducted on more con
servative lines than It is in most Ameri
can cities.
The temperance element has shown It
self satisfied with the workings of the
system by the fact that there has been
no agitation for several years of a stricter
system, and that the last Legislature, of
which a majority of the Senate were
members of Protestant churches, added
the light wine and beer license system.
Rev. Dr. S. E. Bishop, a son of one of
the early missionaries, a man who was
born In the Islands and has been for years
one of the most consistent temperance
advocates, says that if the amendment
becomes a law it will prove a great source
of corruption and demoralization, with
out reducing the liquor traffic any, and
will destroy a system that ha 3 worked
well and proven all that the sentiment of
the community is ready to enforce.
Professor W. T. Alexander, another rep
resentative of the missionary element, is
equally outspoken against the measure
and for the same reasons. Every daily
paper In Honolulu has taken an editorial
position against it, and the entire senti
ment of the community almost is
against it.
The Liquor Dealers' Protective Associa
tion which includes practically the en
tire liquor trade, both wholesale and re
tail, held a very largely attended meet
ing yesterday to consider the subject. A
committee was appointed to prepare and
forward data to the Liquor Dealers' As
sociation of California, showing the sen
timent of the community, the conditions
under which the traffic is carried on and
the great interests to be disastrously af
fected by the amendment. It will show
that the liquor traffic contributes to the
Government a very large proportion of
its revenues. In a legislative report made
in IS9I it was shown that the revenues
from the liquor trade were equal to 52 per
cent of the entire Custom-house receipts.

appreciate her danger until she had res

points of the affair. The captain forced
her to admit that the extent of her loss
as stated by her in the first instance was
wrong. When told of the detective's In
vestigations on Ivy avenue she corrected
htr first statement by saying that the rob
ber pointed the gun at her on Birch ave
nue. This latter avenue does not touch
Van Ness, but runs between Polk and
Larkin streets.
Captain Seymour wound up the inter
view by telling the woman in polite lan
guage that her story was about as false
as any ever told in his office. She appear

COPS ATTIRED AS FEMALES.
The Novel Way to Catch a Footpad
Gets Two Officers Into Serious
Trouble.
The novel way of capturing the gentle
manly footpad now operating in the
Western Addition by detailing several po
lieerm-n in female attire, accompanied by
an equal number in civilian clothes, was
generally discussed yesterday in a strain
of amusement and ridicule. The schc-me
fertilized in the massive brain of Captain
Wittman, he of the "cold feet," and Chief
Sullivan and Captain Seymour were fool
ish enough to bite at It.
Six of the crack shots of the depart
mentâW. W. Wilson. Frank C. Howard,
Smith Carr, Harry Hook. John W. Flem
ing and T. A. Atchisonâ were selected as
the civilians and six young members of
the department of slim build and smooth
cheeks were told to get their wives or
.sisters or sweethearts to fix them up as
maidens fair. Knch was to wear a golf
cape. und*-r which they were to carry a
revolver clutched In the right hand. When
the footpad approached and ordered the
"cop" in civilian clothes to throw up his
hands he was to instantly obey and the
"female" "con" was to step three paces
to the rear, draw a bead on the footpad
and ehoot him dead. If he missed his
mark the crack shot was to instantly
open fire. Unfortunately for the success
of the great and original scheme, the
footpad did not show up. He must have
been suspicious of the number of tall,
awkward females parading the district in
company with stalwart, determined look
ing men. Now that he knows all about it
he will shyclear of men with tall females.
An amusing feature of the fiasco oc
curred yesterday. Frank C. Howard had
as a "female" companion Frank J. Ha
ley, a brother of the ex-County Clerk.
They got tired patrolling their particular
district and strolled into Lafayette
Square. They sat down on one of the
garden chairs under a spreading tree and
had a good time laughing and chatting
about the fool business they were engaged
in. Captain Wittman had walked over
their district two or three times about 10
o'clock without seeing them. Becoming
suspicious that something was wrong, he
struck into the square, a block and a half
away from the boundary of the district.
Gains in the Savings Banks.

overlooked the southern district of the
city. Early yesterday morning the gro

on the corner of Sixth and Harrison
streets was entered by burglars and Â»oo
taken from the till. The entrance was
effected through the side door, the IdcK or

Three burglars visited the residence or

and two houses adjoining Wednesday at
midnight. Mrs. McLaren discovered one

MAGUIRE'S FARE
ORDINANCE NOT
A POPULAR ONE
Street Committee and Mayor
Offer Several Novel
Suggestions.
Representatives of Santa Fe and Bay
Coast Roads to Draw Up Order
for Franchises on Illinois
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday afternoon and
listened to representatives of the various
car lines of the city declare in no un
measured terms why the 2*Â£-cent standing
fare as proposed by Maguire should not
become an integral part of the ordinance.
Mayor Phelan was present and offered
many suggestions, some of which were
as bizarre and fantastic as they were im
practicable.
Maguire admitted that the purpose of
j the ordinance was not so much to force a
reduction" of fares as to secure better ac
'' commodations for the public during hours
: when traffic was particularly heavy and
the travel congested. The Mayor also
made a confession, not that he was the
father of his country, but of this new
streetcar proposition.
The representatives oâ¬ the street rail
way companies cuuia not see the necessity
or the utility of all this. They claimed
that the expense would be greatly in
creased, especiaJiy if they had to employ
extra men for a few hours during the
day. Then the Mayor came to the front
with another choice bit of advice. " He
wanted to know why the butcher, the ba
ker and the barber should not be given a
chance to make a few extra dollars per
month by handling the extra cars during
the hours of increased traffic. To this
came the reply that the public might not
enjoy a ride in an electric car down Bteep
grades when the controller was In the
hand of a dough-mixer or a tonsorlal
artist. The Mayor looked wise for several
minutes, and visions of his high hat fall
ing to the rear of a runaway car brought
him up with a jump.
The Mayor did not impress the car men
very favorably yesterday. In a moment
of enthusiasm he suggested a tunnel for
the busy portion of Market street. When
he was informed that property always de
preciated on either side of these tunnels
in big cities his pedal extremities began
to freeze, but he grasped at the straw
and inferred that a tunnel would be both
artistic and valuable from Montgomery
street to the ferry. The Phelan property '
is farther up the street. . |
Again, when the father of the 2%-cent
standing fare suggested that the compa
nies would soon be before the Supervisors
for renewals of franchises and that they
would better beware, he was answered
that as long as he was Mayor there would
be little desire on the part of capitalists
to Invest their money in public utilities in
this city.
Secretary Clayton of the San Mateo
road read a typewritten argument against
the ordinance, which he considered to bo
impracticable.
"We believe the order will not remedy
the evil it proposes to correct," said Clay
ton. "We also declare it to be. unjust,
for it reduces fares to a point below cost
as a penalty for failure to provide a seat
for every passenger under any emergency.
The topography of San Francisco is such
as to peculiarly lend itself to the crowd
ing of street cars during the rush hours.
All the traffic centers down the narrow
district bordering on Market street. The
tlrst car along' always catches the load
and the national characteristic of 'get
there' will always have a tendency to
crowd street cars in spite of ample accom
modation.
"The proposed ordinance Is not a true
remedy and would increase crowding
rather than alleviate it, for it offers a pre
mium to crowd cars. People who have
'no seat' tickets will wait for a full car
In order to use them. There would be
great difficulty in determining which of
several passengers who boarded a car at
the same time were obliged to pay 5 cents,
and there will be constant disputes as to
who shall pay the higher rate of fare by
the 'short distance' riders on the dum
mies. Under the ordinance the 'no seat'
ticket will entitle the holder to a seat
on the line to which he transfers. We
nay tho 2Vi cents to the other company for
his transfer and we get nothing for carry
ing him on our line. The transfer privi
leges would of necessity be abolished,
they being voluntary on our part and not
bound by the franchise. Thus it would
cost 10 cents instead of 5 as at nresent.
"If it were practicable to put on three
times the number of cars during the rush
hours, from 5 Â»o 6:30 p. m., we could not
obtain men to handle them, as they would
be unwilling to work for only two hours
each day."
At this point the Mayor suggested that
the company might employ many barbers,
butchers, bakers nnd other craftsmen who
would be willing to earn a little money in
addition to their regular stipends, which
Clavton said was a remarkable statement.
Maguire stated that each passenger who
pays 5 cents is entitled to a seat, but he
does not always get It.
"The ordinance has been framed, paid
Maguire, "to bring the companies to a
realizing sense of their duty in operating
enough cars to insure the comfort of their
customers. It is introductory to a great
question of the proper transportation of
the people of this city. I would like you
gentlemen to suggest some way out of tho
difficulty. Will it be remedied by another
turntable at the foot of Market street, by
the loop system at that point, by an ele
vated or an underground system?" .
Clavton said thnt the situation might be
relieved by operating four tracks on Mar
ket street. Superintendent M. D. Stein
said that the acute congestion of traffic
would be lessened when tho Post street
nnd other lines were operated. He asked
for a postponement of the question until
the result could be ascertained. The com
mittee agreed to take the question up at
the next meeting.
The Mayor went off on another tack
and asked what it cost the company to
carry a passenger on a streetcar. Clay
ton replied, 4 cents.
"Well." said his Honor, "that opens up
a new field of investigation and at the
next meeting I would suggest that the car
companies submit a financial statement of
their profits and expenditures.' . â¢
His Honor was apparently in blissful
ignorance of the fact that the companies
could not be compelled to answer such
questions, except under a call for the ac
quisition of a public utility.
Then Phelan pitched into Clayton.
"Well, what interest has ycuf road In
this proposition anyhow? It is a small
road running through obscure streets, it
has never paid and probably never will
pay and was only acquired for a debt.
"We have tho came interest." quickly
replied Clavton, "that you would have

Market street property that would tak*>
all ynur profits away. Furthermore, we

Action on the petitions of the Santa Ft
road nnd the Ray and Coast road to enter
the city on Illinois street was postponed
one week after representatives of the two
roads had been heard.
"There have been allegations." said Phe
lan, "that the Southern Pacific nnd Santa
'Fe roads have been consolidated and the
public hns become distrusted. "
"The Santa Fe road is an independent
transcontinental line," replied its repre
sentative. Attorney Preston, and the
Mayor subsided.
W. T. Baggett said that the Bay and
Coast road was willing to let. the Santa
Fe get the franchise on Illinois street, as
the tracks could be us*d Jointly. The rail
road people were requested to draft an
ordinance embodying all the requirements
fn tho matter for presentation at next
Thursday's meeting.

HELMS POSES AS
A CHAMPION OF
TRACK GAMBLING
Will Submit an Amendment
to Reed's Order Against
Pool Selling.
Police Committee Recommends a Li
cense Tax of Twenty-Five Dol
lars Per Quarter on Nickel
Card Machines,
?
Supervisor Helms demonstrated that n?
Is a stanch champion of the racetrack
gambling interests when he expressed hi.-*
determination at yesterday's meeting oÂ£
the Supervisors' Police Committee to sub
mit an amended order to the board per
mitting horseracing for a period of sLsty
days and allowing poolselling within the
racetrack inclosure. " The Mayor wad
present at the meeting.
The committee decided to recommend
for passage Reed's ordinance, which pro
hibits poolselling on contests between
horses or dogs at any place within thti
city and county. Tocin agreed to this
but reserved the privilege to present an
order prohibiting poolselling on prize
rights as well as animals, since he believed
that all poolrooms should be closed.
Helms, who had tried hard to get the
committee to recommend his order allow.
Ing . racetrack gambling for sixty days
then said that he would ask the full
board to adopt it.
During the discussion Reed remarked
that the proposition to open Ingleside was
impossible, since the Mayor has taken a
determined stand against It. The Mayor
spoke of the evil effects of racetrack gam
bling and said that he had recommended
to the Civil Service Commission to adopt
a rule providing for the removal of any
municipal employe who engages in gam
bling. Helms said that since they allowed
racing In Oakland this city should do
likewise.
"The only way to prevent the defeat of
our purpose to discourage gambling "
said the Mayor, "is to request the Legis
lature to pass a law restricting racing In
each county for thirty days." Tobln ar
nounced his intention to prepare such a
resolution.
The commltte* also decided to recom
mend Reed's order prohibiting parls mu
tuels on prize fights to prevent fake con
tests, and also his order prohibiting the
visiting of poolrooms.
Comte's order prohibiting card and dieÂ«
games of all kinds and nickel and card
machines brought up the subject of tho
open gambling in the Cafe Royal. Chief
Sullivan said it was intended to allow
the place to run until the expiration of
its license, which would not be renewed.
The committee then decided to prepare
an order imposing a license of $23 per
quarter on nickel card machines instead
of abolishing them.

taken from her yesterday afternoon while
walking along Kearny street, near Post.
She wore the ring on her left hand. As
she gathered up her skirts to cross the

a crook, who slipped up behind her and
"pinched" the stone from its setting with
a pair of. nippers. She caught sight of

RESIDENTS OF
WEST END ARE
BADLY SCARED
Daylight Burglars Ply Their
Vocation Without Pear
of Police.
Startling Number of Thefts Reported
From a Resident Section of the
City â Much Valuable
Property Stolen.
Â«
An organized gang of daylight burglars
has been operating in the West End. Most
of its work has been done in the section
west of Polk street and as far as North
Beach. The residents are almost in' a
state of terror, principally on account of
the apparent helplessness of the Police
Department to round up the thieves.
The number of burglaries committed
within the last few days is alarming. The
thieves continue their depredations appa
rently without fear of the police and with
total disregard of humiliating the blue
conts.
Mrs. Petzold's home on Steiner street,
opposite St. Dominic's Church, was en
tered about a week ago during her tem
porary absence. Two diamond rings, a
gold watch, a pair of opera glasses and
some money were taken.
The ganÂ« next visited the residence of
Mrs. E. B. Comings, Chestnut street, be
tween Hyde and Larfcin. She left the
house for a few hours one afternoon and
when she returned she found that her
home had been entered through a window
plainly visible from the street. The marks
of a jimmy were evident. A quantity of
valuable silverware was stolen.
At the home of Mr. Cook on Steiner
street the gang varied its methods and
attempted to enter the placp at night.
Mra. Cook ard her daughter, who were
alone in the house, were startled by the
repeated shaking of the front door. The
daughter summoned up courage and went
to the entrance, but the burglars took
flight.
F. B. Kellum's residence on Central ave
nue was entered one afternoon while the
family was downtown. The housebreak
ers were scared away by a grocer's clerk
before they secured any plunder.
A house at Jackson and Devisadero
streets was entered through a basement
window. The thieves were frightened
away by the furious barking of a pet dog.
Thomas E. Dunne's home, 1439 Hyde
street, was broken into while he and his
wife were absertt. A lot of jewelry was
taken, but a large sum of money was
overlooked.
Mrs. Maggie Ford, who resides on Fil
bert street, is another victim of the house
breakers. . Her residence was turned
"topsy-turvy" during her absence, but
nothing of value was taken.
And this Ib by no means a complete list
of the burglaries. . .

cfi? "WOMAN giving the r.ame of Miss
// 'X A. G. Babcock, also known as Mrs.
Jf^ Goodwin, who has been living at 21
Page street, reported the sensa
tional details of a bold hold-up to the
police yesterday afternoon. Her ac
count of the 3ffair was thrilling In
the extreme and her description of the
perpetrator of the crime tallied exactly
â¢with that of the reckless highwayman
who has already set the Police Depart
ment in a state of turmoil.
Subsequent developments proved to the
patisfaction of the police that the
Â¦woman's )*tory was a fake. She contra
Â«l<ct<?d herself every time she was ques
tioned.
The police, who have been puzzled for
the past few days by the daring work of
tome criminal In the Western Addition. ;
regard with some seriousness the attempt
tif the woman to increase the record of.
hold-ups.
The wornnn railed at police headquar
ters about 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon j
c.nd reported that she had bt-en held up
l>y a man on Ivy avenue, between Van
>Tt-ss avenue and Polk street.
She said she left her home about 2:30
o'clock to go downtown. A man who was
standing at the corner of Page and
Kranklin streets followed her along Mar
ket. She thought he was a "masher"
*.nd to get rid of him turned along the j
â¢ ast side of Van Ness avenue. At Ivy j
nvenue she looked around and saw he j
was close behind her. so she turned into :
the- sHe street. She was carrying her t
purse In her hand, she said, and while it !
appeared well tilled it contained nothing i
but paper*. When she was half way i
down the block the man came up behind ,
her and said, lifting his hat:
"Madam, I wai:t your purse."
She thought he was fooling and replied:
"Go away: I don't want to have any
thing to do with you."
The man then put his hand in his coat
pocket and. pulling out a revolver,- re- [
plated his demand with emphasis. She |
told h'.m she had nothing but papers in i
it, and he made her open it.
"What have you in that small purse?" I
he inquired. She opened it and handed j
h:m an old C5-ce:it piece that *he kept as i
ii souvenir.
"Now," said the footpad, "walk straight j
Â¦lens and if you make any outcry I will i
kill you."
Such was the lurid ttory the told the i
police. She followed it up with a minute
description of' the man which was sus
piciously detailed.
Before the- woman returned to her homo '
her landlady. Mrs. Knapp, who hangs out
a shingle as a clairvoyant and card !
reader, had told the first story which cast j
suspicion on the tale of the alleged hold- \
Â¦up. She s-aid that Mlsa Habeock had re- |
. iated to her the particulars of an attempt- Â¦
Â«d hold-up which happened last Tuesday j
evening:, but which was frustrated by a
male companion, who drew a revolver and
frightened the robber oft. She thought the
hold-up Â»Â»f h/r guest twice in succession a
queer coincidence.
When the Habeock woman arrived home
Fhe denied to reporters the story of the
hold-up she had related to the landlady
Tuesday night and upbraided the latter
for having told it.
She then described the fake affair in a
much different manner than that in |

playing about the premises all afternoon. |
All of them denied that anything unusual I
